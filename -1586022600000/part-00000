It is a [[plucked string instrument]] similar in appearance and construction to an [[Electric guitar|electric]] or an [[acoustic guitar]], except with a longer [[neck (music)|neck]] and [[Scale length (string instruments)|scale length]], and typically four to six [[string (music)|strings]] or [[Course (music)|courses]]. Since the mid-1950s, the electric bass has largely replaced the [[double bass]] in [[popular music]]. \n\nThe four-string bass is usually tuned the same as the [[double bass]], which corresponds to pitches one [[octave]] lower than the four lowest-pitched strings of a guitar (E, A, D, and G). It is played primarily with the fingers or thumb, or [[guitar pick|striking]] with a [[plectrum|pick]]. The electric bass guitar has [[pickup (music technology)|pickups]] and must be connected to an [[Bass amplifier|amplifier and speaker]] to be loud enough to compete with other instruments.\n\n==Terminology==\nAccording to the ''New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', an \"Electric bass guitar [is] a Guitar, usually with four heavy strings tuned E<sub>1</sub>'\u2013A<sub>1</sub>'\u2013D<sub>2</sub>\u2013G<sub>2</sub>.\"{{sfn|Sadie|Tyrrell|2001|p=}} It also defines ''bass'' as \"Bass (iv).

In comparison with the large, heavy [[upright bass]], which had been the main bass instrument in popular music from the early 20th century to the 1940s, the bass guitar could be easily transported to shows. When amplified, the bass guitar was also less prone than acoustic basses to unwanted [[audio feedback]].{{sfn|Roberts|2001|p=}} The addition of [[Fret|frets]] enabled bassists to play in tune more easily than on fretless acoustic or [[electric upright bass]]es, and allowed guitarists to more easily transition to the instrument.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Rogers |first1=Dave |last2=Braithwaite |first2=Laun |last3=May 13 |first3=Tim Mullally |title=1952 Fender Precision Bass |url=https://www.premierguitar.com/articles/1952_Fender_Precision_Bass |website=www.premierguitar.com |accessdate=7 January 2020 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 1953, [[Monk Montgomery]] became the first bassist to tour with the Fender bass, in [[Lionel Hampton]]'s postwar [[big band]].{{sfn|George|1998|p=91}} Montgomery was also possibly the first to record with the electric bass, on July 2, 1953, with [[the Art Farmer Septet]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Bass heroes : styles, stories & secrets of 30 great bass players : from the pages of Guitar player magazine|last=Mulhern|first=Tom|date=1993|publisher=GPI Books|isbn=0-585-34936-3|location=San Francisco|pages=165|oclc=47008985}}</ref> Roy Johnson (with Lionel Hampton), and [[Shifty Henry]] (with [[Louis Jordan]] and His [[Tympany Five]]), were other early Fender bass pioneers.{{sfn|Slog|Coryat|1999|p=154}} [[Bill Black]], who played with [[Elvis Presley]], switched from upright bass to the Fender Precision Bass around 1957.{{sfn|Bacon|2010|p=}} The bass guitar was intended to appeal to guitarists as well as upright bass players, and many early pioneers of the instrument, such as [[Carol Kaye]], [[Joe Osborn]], and [[Paul McCartney]] were originally guitarists.{{sfn|Roberts|2001|p=}}\n\nAlso in 1953, [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]] released the first short-scale [[violin]]-shaped electric bass, with an extendable end pin so a bassist could play it upright or horizontally. Gibson renamed the bass the [[Gibson EB-1|EB-1]] in 1958.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} In 1958, Gibson released the maple arched-top [[Gibson EB-2|EB-2]] described in the Gibson catalog as a \"hollow-body electric bass that features a Bass/Baritone pushbutton for two different tonal characteristics\".{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} In 1959, these were followed by the more conventional-looking [[Gibson EB-0|EB-0 Bass]].{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} The EB-0 was very similar to a [[Gibson SG]] in appearance (although the earliest examples have a slab-sided body shape closer to that of the double-cutaway [[Les Paul]] Special).  Whereas Fender basses had pickups mounted in positions in between the base of the neck and the top of the bridge, many of Gibson's early basses featured one [[humbucker|humbucking]] pickup mounted directly against the neck pocket.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}  The Fender and Gibson versions used [[Bolt-on neck|bolt-on]] and [[Set-in neck|glued-on]] necks.\n\nA number of other companies also began manufacturing bass guitars during the 1950s. 1956 saw the appearance at the German trade fair \"Musikmesse Frankfurt\" of the distinctive [[H\u00f6fner 500/1]] violin-shaped bass made using violin construction techniques by Walter [[H\u00f6fner]], a second-generation violin luthier.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} The design was eventually known popularly as the \"[[The Beatles|Beatle Bass]]\", due to its endorsement and use by Beatles bassist [[Paul McCartney]]. In 1957, [[Rickenbacker]] introduced the model 4000,the first bass to feature a [[neck-through]]-body design in which the neck is part of the body wood.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} [[Kay Musical Instrument Company]] began production of the K-162 in 1952, [[Danelectro]] released the Longhorn in 1956, and [[Burns London]]/Supersound in 1958.{{sfn|Bacon|2010|p=}}\n\n=== 1960s ===\n[[File:Gibson eb3 67.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Gibson EB-3]]]]\nWith the explosion of the popularity of [[rock music]] in the 1960s, many more manufacturers began making electric basses, including [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]], [[Teisco]] and [[Guyatone]]. Introduced in 1960, the [[Fender Jazz Bass]], initially known as the \"Deluxe Bass\", was intended to accompany the [[Jazzmaster]] guitar.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} The \"J-bass\" featured two single-coil pickups, one close to the bridge and one in the Precision bass's split coil pickup position. The earliest production Jazz basses had a \"stacked\"{{explain|date=February 2019}} volume and tone control for each pickup; this was soon changed to the familiar configuration of a volume control for each pickup, and a single passive tone control. \n\nThe Jazz Bass's neck was narrower at the nut than the Precision bass \u2014 {{convert|1+1/2|in|mm|0}} versus {{convert|1+3/4|in|mm|0}} \u2014 allowing for easier access to the lower strings and an overall spacing and feel closer to that of an electric guitar, allowing trained guitarists to transition to the bass guitar more easily.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} Another visual difference that set the Jazz Bass apart from the Precision is its \"offset-waist\" body.{{explain|date=February 2019}}\n\nPickup shapes on electric basses are often referred to as \"P\" or \"J\" pickups in reference to the visual and electrical differences between the Precision Bass and Jazz Bass [[pick up (music technology)|pickups]].{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} In the 1950s and 1960s, all bass guitars were often called the \"Fender bass\", due to [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]]'s early dominance in the market.\n\nProviding a more \"Gibson-scale\" instrument, rather than the {{convert|34|in|mm|0}} Jazz and Precision, Fender produced the [[Fender Mustang Bass|Mustang Bass]], a {{convert|30|in|mm|0|adj=on}} scale-length instrument.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}  The [[Fender VI]], a 6 string bass, was tuned one octave lower than standard guitar tuning.

Alembic also pioneered the use of onboard electronics for pre-amplification and equalization.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} Active electronics increase the output of the instrument, and allow more options for controlling tonal flexibility, giving the player the ability to amplify as well as to attenuate certain frequency ranges while improving the overall frequency response (including more low-register and high-register sounds). 1973 saw the UK company [[Wal (bass)|Wal]] begin production of a their own range of active basses.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} In 1974 [[Music Man (company)|Music Man]] Instruments, founded by Tom Walker, [[Forrest White]] and [[Leo Fender]], introduced the [[Music Man StingRay|StingRay]], the first widely produced bass with active (powered) electronics built into the instrument.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} Basses with active electronics can include a [[preamplifier]] and [[equalizer (audio)|knobs]] for boosting and cutting the low and high frequencies.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Alembic and other high-end manufacturers, such as [[Tobias (bass guitar company)|Tobias]], began offering five-string basses, with a very low \"B\" string.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} In 1975, bassist [[Anthony Jackson (musician)|Anthony Jackson]] commissioned luthier [[Carl Thompson (luthier)|Carl Thompson]] to build a six-string bass tuned (low to high) B0, E1, A1, D2, G2, C3, adding a low B string and a high C string.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://bassmagazine.com/artists/partners-anthony-jackson-fodera-guitars |title = Partners: Anthony Jackson & Fodera Guitars}}</ref> These five- and six-string \"[[extended-range bass]]es\" would become popular with [[Session musician|session bassists]], reducing the need for re-tuning to alternate detuned configurations like \"drop D\", and also allowing the bassist to play more notes from the same fretting position with fewer shifts up and down the fingerboard, a crucial benefit for a session player [[sightreading]] [[bassline]]s at a recording session.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n=== 1980s\u2013present ===\n[[File:Steinberger bass.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Early 1980s-era Steinberger headless bass. The tuning machines are at the heel of the instrument, where the bridge is usually located.]]\nIn the 1980s, bass designers continued to explore new approaches. [[Ned Steinberger]] introduced a headless bass in 1979 and continued his innovations in the 1980s, using graphite and other new materials and (in 1984) introducing the [[TransTrem]] [[tremolo arm|tremolo bar]]. In 1982, Hans-Peter Wilfer founded [[Warwick (company)|Warwick]], to make a European bass, as the market at the time was dominated by Asian and American basses. Their first bass was the [[Streamer Bass]], which is similar to the Spector NS. In 1987, the Guild Guitar Corporation launched the fretless [[Ashbory bass]], which used silicone rubber strings and a piezoelectric pickup to achieve an \"upright bass\" sound with a short {{convert|18|in|mm|0|adj=on}} scale length. In the late 1980s, [[MTV Unplugged|MTV's \"Unplugged\"]] show, which featured bands performing with acoustic instruments, helped to popularize hollow-bodied [[acoustic bass guitar]]s amplified with [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]] pickups built into the bridge of the instrument.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nDuring the 1990s, as five-string basses became more widely available and more affordable, an increasing number of bassists in genres ranging from [[heavy metal music|metal]] to [[gospel music|gospel]] began using five-string instruments for added lower range\u2014a low \"B\" string. As well, onboard battery-powered electronics such as preamplifiers and equalizer circuits, which were previously only available on expensive \"boutique\" instruments, became increasingly available on mid-priced basses. From 2000 to the 2010s, some bass manufacturers included [[digital signal processing|digital]] modelling circuits inside the instrument on more costly instruments to recreate tones and sounds from many models of basses (e.g., [[Line 6 (company)|Line 6's]] Variax bass). A modelling bass can digitally emulate the tone and sound of many famous basses, ranging from a vintage Fender Precision to a Rickenbacker. However, as with the electric guitar, traditional \"passive\" bass designs, which include only pickups, tone and volume knobs (without a preamp or other electronics) remained popular. Reissued versions of vintage instruments such as the [[Fender Precision Bass]] and [[Fender Jazz Bass]] remained popular among new instrument buyers up to the 2010s. In 2011, a 60th Anniversary P-bass was introduced by [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]], along with the re-introduction of the short-scale [[Fender Jaguar Bass]].{{cn|date=October 2019}}Youtuber Davie504 has shown bass to a whole new era of people, with over 5 million subscribers he is now considered by many to be the best bass player in the world.\n\n== Fretless basses ==\n[[File:Flatwound 01.JPG|thumb|right|A fretless bass with flatwound strings; markers are inlaid into the side of the fingerboard, to aid the performer in finding the correct pitch.]]\nWhile electric bass guitars are traditionally fretted instruments, fretless basses are used by some players to achieve different tones.  [[the Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]] bassist [[Bill Wyman]] is sometimes identified as the first to make a fretless bass.  In 1961, he converted a used UK-built Dallas Tuxedo bass by removing the frets and filling in the slots with wood putty.{{sfn|Roberts|2001|p=}} Wyman used it to record  songs such as \"[[Paint It, Black]]\" and \"[[Mother's Little Helper]]\" in 1966.\n\nIn 1966, [[Ampeg]] introduced the AUB-1, the first production fretless bass. Fender followed with a fretless Precision Bass in 1970. Some fretless basses have \"fret line\" markers inlaid in the fingerboard as a guide, while others only use guide marks on the side of the neck. In the early 1970s, fusion-jazz bassist [[Jaco Pastorius]] coated the fingerboard of his de-fretted Fender Jazz Bass in [[epoxy resin]], allowing him to use roundwound strings for a brighter sound without damaging the fretboard.\n\n== Strings and tuning ==\n{{Main|Bass guitar tuning}}\nTraditional electric bass guitars have four strings, tuned the same as [[double bass]]es: E<sub>1</sub>\u2013A<sub>1</sub>\u2013D<sub>2</sub>\u2013G<sub>2</sub>. However, now there are many options, with five-, six-, and more string designs, with many approaches to tuning.  In addition to traditional [[flatwound]] strings, choices now include various windings and materials.\n\n== Pickups and amplification ==\n{{Main|Pickup (music technology)}}\n=== Magnetic pickups ===\n[[File:Precision Bass pickup.jpg|thumb|left|P-style, split-coil pickups]]\n\n* '''\"Precision\" pickups''' (as introduced with the Fender Precision Bass) or \"P-style\" are two [[single-coil]] pickups, each offset a small amount along the length of the body so that each half is underneath two strings. The pair is considered a single pickup, as they are wired together in a [[humbucker|humbucking]] configuration, greatly reducing noise from nearby electronic equipment and mains power. (Less common is the \"single-coil P\" pickup, as used on the original 1951 Precision bass. This is also known as the 'Vintage P' due to it being found on old vintage basses made before the invention of the split coil pickup. The \"single-coil P\" pickup is also used in the reissue and the Sting signature model.) P-style pickups are generally placed in the \"neck\" or \"middle\" position, but they are occasionally placed in the bridge position, or between two Jazz-style pickups.\n\n[[File:Jazz Style PickUps.JPG|thumb|right|Dual \"J\"-style pickups]]\n* '''\"Jazz\" pickups''' (as introduced with the Fender Jazz Bass) or \"J-style\", are wide eight-pole pickups that lie underneath all four strings. J pickups are typically [[single-coil]] designs, though there are a large number of humbucking designs. Traditionally, two of them are used, one near the bridge and another closer to the neck. As with the halves of P-pickups, the J-type pickups are wired in a humbucking manner so that, when used together, mains noise is greatly eliminated. J-type pickups tend to have a lower output and a thinner sound than P-type pickups. Many bassists combine a 'J' pickup at the bridge and a 'P' pickup at the neck and blend the two sounds.\n\n* '''Dual coil \"[[humbucker]]\"''' pickups each have two signal-producing coils. Humbuckers also produce a higher output level than single-coil pickups, though many dual-coil pickups are marketed as retrofits for single-coil designs like the J pickup and advertise a similar output and tonal character to the stock single-coils.\n\n=== Non-magnetic pickups ===\nThe use of non-magnetic pickups allows bassists to use non-ferrous strings such as nylon, brass, polyurethane and [[Ashbory bass|silicone rubber]]. These materials produce different tones and, in the case of the polyurethane or silicone rubber strings, allow much shorter scale lengths.\n* [[piezoelectricity|Piezoelectric]] (or \"piezo\") pickups (also called \"piezo\" pickups) use a [[transducer]] to convert vibrations in the instrument's body or bridge into an electrical signal. They are typically mounted under the bridge saddle or near the bridge and produce a different tone from magnetic pickups, often similar to that of an acoustic bass. Piezo pickups are often used in acoustic bass guitars to allow for amplification without a microphone.\n* [[Pick up (music technology)#Optical|Optical pickups]] use an infrared [[LED]] to optically track the movement of the string, which allows them to reproduce low-frequency tones at high volumes without the \"hum\" or excessive resonance associated with conventional magnetic pickups. Since optical pickups do not pick up high frequencies or percussive sounds well, they are commonly paired with piezoelectric pickups to fill in the missing frequencies.\n\n[[File:Elbas.jpg|thumb|right|Bass-stack amp and speaker configuration]]\n=== Amplification and effects ===\n{{Main|Bass instrument amplification|Bass effects}}\nSimilar to the electric guitar, the typical electric bass guitar requires an external amplifier in order to be heard in performance settings. Additionally, various electronic effects, such as [[preamplifier]]s, \"stomp box\"-style pedals and signal processors are available to allow for further shaping of the sound.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Bass guitar techniques]]\n* [[Bass guitar tuning]]\n* [[List of bass guitar manufacturers]]\n* [[List of bass guitarists]]\n{{clear}}\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n===Sources===\n*{{cite book |last=Bacon |first=Tony |title=60 Years of Fender: Six Decades of the Greatest Electric Guitars |year=2010 |publisher=[[Backbeat Books]] |isbn=978-0879309664 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Bacon |first1=Tony |last2=Moorhouse |first2=Barry |year=2016 |title=The Bass Book: A Complete Illustrated History of Bass Guitars |publisher=[[Backbeat Books]] |isbn=978-1-4950-0150-5 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Black |first=J.

It is a [[plucked string instrument]] similar in appearance and construction to an [[Electric guitar|electric]] or an [[acoustic guitar]], except with a longer [[neck (music)|neck]] and [[Scale length (string instruments)|scale length]], and typically four to six [[string (music)|strings]] or [[Course (music)|courses]]. Since the mid-1950s, the electric bass has largely replaced the [[double bass]] in [[popular music]]. \n\nThe four-string bass is usually tuned the same as the [[double bass]], which corresponds to pitches one [[octave]] lower than the four lowest-pitched strings of a guitar (E, A, D, and G). It is played primarily with the fingers or thumb, or [[guitar pick|striking]] with a [[plectrum|pick]]. The electric bass guitar has [[pickup (music technology)|pickups]] and must be connected to an [[Bass amplifier|amplifier and speaker]] to be loud enough to compete with other instruments.\n\n==Terminology==\nAccording to the ''New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', an \"Electric bass guitar [is] a Guitar, usually with four heavy strings tuned E<sub>1</sub>'\u2013A<sub>1</sub>'\u2013D<sub>2</sub>\u2013G<sub>2</sub>.\"{{sfn|Sadie|Tyrrell|2001|p=}} It also defines ''bass'' as \"Bass (iv).

Alembic also pioneered the use of onboard electronics for pre-amplification and equalization.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} Active electronics increase the output of the instrument, and allow more options for controlling tonal flexibility, giving the player the ability to amplify as well as to attenuate certain frequency ranges while improving the overall frequency response (including more low-register and high-register sounds). 1973 saw the UK company [[Wal (bass)|Wal]] begin production of a their own range of active basses.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} In 1974 [[Music Man (company)|Music Man]] Instruments, founded by Tom Walker, [[Forrest White]] and [[Leo Fender]], introduced the [[Music Man StingRay|StingRay]], the first widely produced bass with active (powered) electronics built into the instrument.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} Basses with active electronics can include a [[preamplifier]] and [[equalizer (audio)|knobs]] for boosting and cutting the low and high frequencies.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Alembic and other high-end manufacturers, such as [[Tobias (bass guitar company)|Tobias]], began offering five-string basses, with a very low \"B\" string.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} In 1975, bassist [[Anthony Jackson (musician)|Anthony Jackson]] commissioned luthier [[Carl Thompson (luthier)|Carl Thompson]] to build a six-string bass tuned (low to high) B0, E1, A1, D2, G2, C3, adding a low B string and a high C string.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://bassmagazine.com/artists/partners-anthony-jackson-fodera-guitars |title = Partners: Anthony Jackson & Fodera Guitars}}</ref> These five- and six-string \"[[extended-range bass]]es\" would become popular with [[Session musician|session bassists]], reducing the need for re-tuning to alternate detuned configurations like \"drop D\", and also allowing the bassist to play more notes from the same fretting position with fewer shifts up and down the fingerboard, a crucial benefit for a session player [[sightreading]] [[bassline]]s at a recording session.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n=== 1980s\u2013present ===\n[[File:Steinberger bass.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Early 1980s-era Steinberger headless bass. The tuning machines are at the heel of the instrument, where the bridge is usually located.]]\nIn the 1980s, bass designers continued to explore new approaches. [[Ned Steinberger]] introduced a headless bass in 1979 and continued his innovations in the 1980s, using graphite and other new materials and (in 1984) introducing the [[TransTrem]] [[tremolo arm|tremolo bar]]. In 1982, Hans-Peter Wilfer founded [[Warwick (company)|Warwick]], to make a European bass, as the market at the time was dominated by Asian and American basses. Their first bass was the [[Streamer Bass]], which is similar to the Spector NS. In 1987, the Guild Guitar Corporation launched the fretless [[Ashbory bass]], which used silicone rubber strings and a piezoelectric pickup to achieve an \"upright bass\" sound with a short {{convert|18|in|mm|0|adj=on}} scale length. In the late 1980s, [[MTV Unplugged|MTV's \"Unplugged\"]] show, which featured bands performing with acoustic instruments, helped to popularize hollow-bodied [[acoustic bass guitar]]s amplified with [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]] pickups built into the bridge of the instrument.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nDuring the 1990s, as five-string basses became more widely available and more affordable, an increasing number of bassists in genres ranging from [[heavy metal music|metal]] to [[gospel music|gospel]] began using five-string instruments for added lower range\u2014a low \"B\" string. As well, onboard battery-powered electronics such as preamplifiers and equalizer circuits, which were previously only available on expensive \"boutique\" instruments, became increasingly available on mid-priced basses. From 2000 to the 2010s, some bass manufacturers included [[digital signal processing|digital]] modelling circuits inside the instrument on more costly instruments to recreate tones and sounds from many models of basses (e.g., [[Line 6 (company)|Line 6's]] Variax bass). A modelling bass can digitally emulate the tone and sound of many famous basses, ranging from a vintage Fender Precision to a Rickenbacker. However, as with the electric guitar, traditional \"passive\" bass designs, which include only pickups, tone and volume knobs (without a preamp or other electronics) remained popular. Reissued versions of vintage instruments such as the [[Fender Precision Bass]] and [[Fender Jazz Bass]] remained popular among new instrument buyers up to the 2010s. In 2011, a 60th Anniversary P-bass was introduced by [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]], along with the re-introduction of the short-scale [[Fender Jaguar Bass]].{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n== Fretless basses ==\n[[File:Flatwound 01.JPG|thumb|right|A fretless bass with flatwound strings; markers are inlaid into the side of the fingerboard, to aid the performer in finding the correct pitch.]]\nWhile electric bass guitars are traditionally fretted instruments, fretless basses are used by some players to achieve different tones.  [[the Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]] bassist [[Bill Wyman]] is sometimes identified as the first to make a fretless bass.  In 1961, he converted a used UK-built Dallas Tuxedo bass by removing the frets and filling in the slots with wood putty.{{sfn|Roberts|2001|p=}} Wyman used it to record  songs such as \"[[Paint It, Black]]\" and \"[[Mother's Little Helper]]\" in 1966.\n\nIn 1966, [[Ampeg]] introduced the AUB-1, the first production fretless bass. Fender followed with a fretless Precision Bass in 1970. Some fretless basses have \"fret line\" markers inlaid in the fingerboard as a guide, while others only use guide marks on the side of the neck. In the early 1970s, fusion-jazz bassist [[Jaco Pastorius]] coated the fingerboard of his de-fretted Fender Jazz Bass in [[epoxy resin]], allowing him to use roundwound strings for a brighter sound without damaging the fretboard.\n\n== Strings and tuning ==\n{{Main|Bass guitar tuning}}\nTraditional electric bass guitars have four strings, tuned the same as [[double bass]]es: E<sub>1</sub>\u2013A<sub>1</sub>\u2013D<sub>2</sub>\u2013G<sub>2</sub>. However, now there are many options, with five-, six-, and more string designs, with many approaches to tuning.  In addition to traditional [[flatwound]] strings, choices now include various windings and materials.\n\n== Pickups and amplification ==\n{{Main|Pickup (music technology)}}\n=== Magnetic pickups ===\n[[File:Precision Bass pickup.jpg|thumb|left|P-style, split-coil pickups]]\n\n* '''\"Precision\" pickups''' (as introduced with the Fender Precision Bass) or \"P-style\" are two [[single-coil]] pickups, each offset a small amount along the length of the body so that each half is underneath two strings. The pair is considered a single pickup, as they are wired together in a [[humbucker|humbucking]] configuration, greatly reducing noise from nearby electronic equipment and mains power. (Less common is the \"single-coil P\" pickup, as used on the original 1951 Precision bass. This is also known as the 'Vintage P' due to it being found on old vintage basses made before the invention of the split coil pickup. The \"single-coil P\" pickup is also used in the reissue and the Sting signature model.) P-style pickups are generally placed in the \"neck\" or \"middle\" position, but they are occasionally placed in the bridge position, or between two Jazz-style pickups.\n\n[[File:Jazz Style PickUps.JPG|thumb|right|Dual \"J\"-style pickups]]\n* '''\"Jazz\" pickups''' (as introduced with the Fender Jazz Bass) or \"J-style\", are wide eight-pole pickups that lie underneath all four strings. J pickups are typically [[single-coil]] designs, though there are a large number of humbucking designs. Traditionally, two of them are used, one near the bridge and another closer to the neck. As with the halves of P-pickups, the J-type pickups are wired in a humbucking manner so that, when used together, mains noise is greatly eliminated. J-type pickups tend to have a lower output and a thinner sound than P-type pickups. Many bassists combine a 'J' pickup at the bridge and a 'P' pickup at the neck and blend the two sounds.\n\n* '''Dual coil \"[[humbucker]]\"''' pickups each have two signal-producing coils. Humbuckers also produce a higher output level than single-coil pickups, though many dual-coil pickups are marketed as retrofits for single-coil designs like the J pickup and advertise a similar output and tonal character to the stock single-coils.\n\n=== Non-magnetic pickups ===\nThe use of non-magnetic pickups allows bassists to use non-ferrous strings such as nylon, brass, polyurethane and [[Ashbory bass|silicone rubber]]. These materials produce different tones and, in the case of the polyurethane or silicone rubber strings, allow much shorter scale lengths.\n* [[piezoelectricity|Piezoelectric]] (or \"piezo\") pickups (also called \"piezo\" pickups) use a [[transducer]] to convert vibrations in the instrument's body or bridge into an electrical signal. They are typically mounted under the bridge saddle or near the bridge and produce a different tone from magnetic pickups, often similar to that of an acoustic bass. Piezo pickups are often used in acoustic bass guitars to allow for amplification without a microphone.\n* [[Pick up (music technology)#Optical|Optical pickups]] use an infrared [[LED]] to optically track the movement of the string, which allows them to reproduce low-frequency tones at high volumes without the \"hum\" or excessive resonance associated with conventional magnetic pickups. Since optical pickups do not pick up high frequencies or percussive sounds well, they are commonly paired with piezoelectric pickups to fill in the missing frequencies.\n\n[[File:Elbas.jpg|thumb|right|Bass-stack amp and speaker configuration]]\n=== Amplification and effects ===\n{{Main|Bass instrument amplification|Bass effects}}\nSimilar to the electric guitar, the typical electric bass guitar requires an external amplifier in order to be heard in performance settings. Additionally, various electronic effects, such as [[preamplifier]]s, \"stomp box\"-style pedals and signal processors are available to allow for further shaping of the sound.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Bass guitar techniques]]\n* [[Bass guitar tuning]]\n* [[List of bass guitar manufacturers]]\n* [[List of bass guitarists]]\n{{clear}}\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n===Sources===\n*{{cite book |last=Bacon |first=Tony |title=60 Years of Fender: Six Decades of the Greatest Electric Guitars |year=2010 |publisher=[[Backbeat Books]] |isbn=978-0879309664 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Bacon |first1=Tony |last2=Moorhouse |first2=Barry |year=2016 |title=The Bass Book: A Complete Illustrated History of Bass Guitars |publisher=[[Backbeat Books]] |isbn=978-1-4950-0150-5 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Black |first=J.

''H. erectus'' was the first fossil [[hominin]] found as a result of a directed expedition.\n\nExcavated from the bank of the [[Solo River]] at [[Trinil]], [[East Java]], he first allocated the material to a genus of fossil chimpanzees as ''Anthropopithecus erectus'', then the following year assigned it to a new genus as ''[[Pithecanthropus]] erectus'' (the genus name had been coined by [[Ernst Haeckel]] in 1868 for the hypothetical link between humans and fossil Apes). The species name ''erectus'' was given because the femur suggested that Java Man had been [[biped]]al and walked upright.

In 1999, British anthropology [[Richard Wrangham]] proposed the \"cooking hypothesis\" which states that ''H. erectus'' speciated from their predecessor ''H. habilis'' because of fire usage and cooking 2 mya to explain the rapid doubling of brain size between these two species in only a 500,000 year timespan and the sudden appearance of the typical human body plan. Cooking would have been especially helpful in digestion of calorie-rich tubers which were common in their savanna environment, allowing group size to expand, causing selective pressure for sociality, requiring greater brain function. Artificial lighting also allowed for increased waking hours\u2014modern humans have about a 16 hour waking period, whereas other apes are generally awake from only sunup to sundown\u2014and these additional hours were probably used for socializing. Because of this, fire usage is probably also linked to the [[origin of language]].<ref name=Gowlett2016/><ref name=Gowlett2013/> Artificial lighting may have also made sleeping on the ground instead of the trees possible by keeping terrestrial predators at bay.<ref name=Gowlett2013/>\n\nMigration into the frigid climate of Ice Age Europe may have only been possible because of fire, but evidence of fire usage in Europe from 1 million to about 400\u2013300,000 years ago is notably absent.<ref name=Roebroeks2011/> If these early European ''H. erectus'' did not have fire, it is largely unclear how they stayed warm, avoided predators, and prepared animal fat and meat for consumption; and lightning is less common farther north equating to a reduced availability of naturally occurring fires. It is possible that they only knew how to maintain fires in certain settings in the landscapes and prepared food some distance away from home, meaning evidence of fire and evidence of hominin activity are spaced far apart.<ref name=Gowlett2013>{{cite journal|first=J.

In 1999, Richard Wrangham proposed the \"cooking hypothesis\" which states that ''H. erectus'' speciated from their predecessor ''H. habilis'' because of fire usage and cooking 2 mya to explain the rapid doubling of brain size between these two species in only a 500,000 year timespan and the sudden appearance of the typical human body plan. Cooking would have been especially helpful in digestion of calorie-rich tubers which were common in their savanna environment, allowing group size to expand, causing selective pressure for sociality requiring greater brain function. Artificial lighting also allowed for increased waking hours\u2014modern humans have about a 16 hour waking period, whereas other apes are generally awake from only sunup to sundown\u2014and these additional hours were probably used for socializing. Because of this, fire usage is probably also linked to the [[origin of language]].<ref name=Gowlett2016/><ref name=Gowlett2013/> Artificial lighting may have also made sleeping on the ground instead of the trees possible by keeping terrestrial predators at bay.<ref name=Gowlett2013/>\n\nMigration into the frigid climate of Ice Age Europe may have only been possible because of fire, but evidence of fire usage in Europe from 1 million to about 400\u2013300,000 years ago is notably absent.<ref name=Roebroeks2011/> If these early European ''H. erectus'' did not have fire, it is largely unclear how they stayed warm, avoided predators, and prepared animal fat and meat for consumption; and lightning is less common farther north equating to a reduced availability of naturally occurring fires. It is possible that they only knew how to maintain fires in certain settings in the landscapes and prepared food some distance away from home, meaning evidence of fire and evidence of hominin activity are spaced far apart.<ref name=Gowlett2013>{{cite journal|first=J.

Within days Raju gets success by associating with Riya's joint family. But the conservative, chauvinist and patriarchal Mahendra Roy shifts bad and constantly sends negative vibes towards Raju in a passive way.

{"title_page": "Ontario electricity policy", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2013}}\n'''Ontario electricity policy''' refers to plans, legislation, incentives, guidelines, and policy processes put in place by the Government of the Province of [[Ontario]], Canada, to address issues of electricity production, distribution, and consumption. Policymaking in the electricity sector involves economic, social, and environmental considerations. Ontario's electricity supply outlook is projected to deteriorate in the near future due to increasing demand, aging electricity supply infrastructure, and political commitments, particularly the [[coal phase-out|phase-out of coal-fired generation]]. Policymakers are presented with a range of policy choices in addressing the situation, both in terms of overall system design and structure, and specific electricity generating technologies.\n\nOntario finds itself faced with choices that define energy policy debates throughout the western world: the role of markets vs. centralized planning and what [[Amory Lovins]] has termed [[soft energy path|\"hard\" versus \"soft energy paths\"]]; i.e. continued reliance on large, centralized generation, particularly nuclear and coal, or moving towards decentralized technologies, including energy efficiency and low impact renewables. As such, how Ontario electricity policy evolves in the near future will be of relevance to other jurisdictions facing similar options or challenges.\n\n__TOC__\n\n==History of electricity demand planning in Ontario==\n\n===Early history===\nIn 1925, Ontario's public electricity utility, established in 1906, the Ontario Hydro Electric Commission (HEC) (later [[Ontario Hydro]]) constructed what was then the world's largest [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric plant]], Queenston-Chippawa (now Beck 1). From this early beginning until the postwar economic boom of the 1950s, Ontario Hydro was able to meet growing demand for electricity by expanding its network of hydraulic generating facilities.<ref>Ontario (Porter Commission). The Report of the Royal Commission on Electric Power Planning: Volume 1, Concepts, Conclusions and Recommendations, p.27; See also: Ontario Power Authority, Supply Mix Advice Report, Background Report, Volume 3</ref> Planning for Ontario's electricity system was relatively simple for two reasons: 1) electricity was coming almost entirely from hydroelectric power; and 2) the electricity system consisted of several smaller systems, making management considerably easier.\n\nChallenges to the system began to emerge in the 1950s: the accessible waterpower sites were exploited; and the province's electricity distribution system was limited in capacity. To address these problems, the HEC began constructing new coal-fired electricity generation plants near major sources of electricity demand and launched plans to build nuclear power plants across the province of Ontario. Between the early 1970s and early 1990s twenty [[CANDU]] power reactors were brought into service at the Pickering (8 reactors), Bruce (8 reactors) and Darlington (4 reactors) nuclear generating facilities.\n\n===Electricity demand planning 1970s\u20131990s===\nThe Power Corporation Act required Ontario Hydro, (formerly HEPCO, renamed in 1974) to provide \"power at cost\". This philosophy became part of the culture and lore of electricity supply in Ontario. The utility did not pay taxes, nor was it intended to generate profits.<ref>Dewess, Don. 2005. \"Electricity Restructuring and Regulation in the Provinces: Ontario and Beyond\", Presented to the Energy, Sustainability and Integration, The CCGES Transatlantic Energy Conference.</ref>\n\n====Porter Commission====\nAmid growing concern over the cost of nuclear power, coupled with inflation and recessions that reduced the demand for electricity, the Porter Commission (1975\u20131979) performed a detailed review on the problem of electricity supply. The Porter Commission's conclusions were simple: demand management, not supply planning, must be the focus of Ontario electricity planning.<ref>Howard Hampton. 2003. ''Public Power: The Fight for Publicly Owned Electricity''. Toronto: Insomniac Press, p.130.</ref>\n\n====Demand/Supply Plan (DSP) Report==== \nIt was not until 1989, however, that Ontario Hydro published its first Demand/Supply Plan (DSP) Report, \"Providing the Balance of Power\". The plan projected a supply/demand gap would open up in the mid-1990s, reaching 9,700 MW by 2005 and 21,300 MW by 2014. To address this gap, Ontario Hydro proposed building several additional nuclear and coal-fired generation plants.<ref>Ontario Hydro. 1989. ''Providing the Balance of Power: Ontario Hydro's Plan to Serve Customers Electricity Needs''. Toronto: Ontario Hydro.</ref> In 1992, Ontario Hydro issued a revised Supply/Demand Plan Report.<ref>Ontario Hydro. 1992. ''Providing Balance of Power: Update 1992''. Toronto: Ontario Hydro.</ref> As a public body, all Ontario Hydro projects, including the DSP, were subject to the province's Environmental Assessment Act. By 1993, however, faced with increasing criticism from the province's independent, quasi-judicial Environmental Assessment Board, a recession and economic restructuring that dramatically reduced industrial electricity demand, and an oversupply of electricity as the Darlington nuclear power plant came into service, the DSP was withdrawn by Ontario Hydro and no additional generating facilities were built.\n\n===Ontario's short experiment with competitive retail markets===\nIn the 1990s, Ontario Hydro's enormous debt from the building of the [[Darlington Nuclear Generating Station|Darlington nuclear generating station]] became a major political issue. Ontario Hydro was becoming financially and operationally dysfunctional. The situation forced Ontario Hydro to dramatically reduce staff and transmission investments. Ontario Hydro also published a document called Hydro 21.<ref>Ontario Power Authority. 2006. ''Supply Mix Advice Report, Background Report'', p.6.</ref> This report suggested that electricity system in Ontario should be restructured in a more market oriented direction.\n\nThe political impetus for restructuring increased with the 1995 election of the [[Mike Harris]] government. In that year, Mike Harris commissioned the Macdonald Committee. The committee recommended the elimination of Ontario Hydro's monopoly on managing generation capacity and that the electricity market be opened up to competition. In response to the Macdonald Committee's recommendations, the Ontario government released \"Direction for Change: Charting a Course for Competitive Electricity and Jobs in Ontario\" in 1997, detailing the government's plans to open the market for electricity supply.\n\nThe competitive market did not actually open until May 2002. Participation in the retail market was voluntary, with customers having the option of entering into contracts or rates being set in the five-minute spot market. Retail consumers were also free to enter fixed-rate contracts. For those that opted out of the contract option, electricity rates passed through a smoothed spot market price. When the market opened in May, wholesale prices averaged 3.01 cents per kWh. For a number of reasons, however, including an especially hot summer, a reduction in domestic generating capacity, and an increasing reliance on a limited import capacity, prices began to rise sharply. In July, average wholesale price was 6.2 cents per kWh.<ref name=\"Trebilcock 2005 123 146\">Trebilcock, Michael .J. and Roy Hrab. 2005. Electricity restructuring in Ontario.

Transmission and distribution rates were also frozen at their existing levels and would remain unchanged until 1 May 2006. The net result was a complete cessation of new investment in generation capacity and a significant cutback in new investment in transmission and distribution.\n\n====Concerns regarding aging nuclear plants====\nIn 1996, major questions arose regarding the status of Ontario's nuclear plants. The oldest of these plants built in the 1970s were aging and in the early 1990s reliability began to decline significantly. The situation drew the attention of the federal nuclear regulator, the Atomic Energy Control Board of Canada (AECB) (now Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission), and was acknowledged by Ontario Hydro. In 1996, the AECB judged the situation at Pickering A to be particularly critical and issued the plant a six-month operating license. The following year a review board of industry experts concluded that the operations of Ontario's nuclear plants were \"below standard\" and \"minimally acceptable\". The Ontario government responded by approving a Nuclear Asset Optimization Plan proposed by Ontario Hydro. The plan had three major objectives: 1) the closure of the seven oldest of the utility's 19 operational nuclear reactors for rehabilitation; 2) the redeployment of staff; and 3) the spending of between $5 and $8 billion to implement the plan.<ref>Ministry of Energy. 2007.

The legislation provided for the creation of the [[Ontario Power Authority]] (OPA). One of the four mandates of the OPA was to address the power system planning issues.\n\n===Green Energy Act===\nOntario's Green Energy Act (GEA), and related amendments to other legislation, received Royal Assent on 14 May 2009.<ref>[http://www.mei.gov.on.ca/en/energy/gea/ Ministry of Energy: Green Energy Act]</ref> Regulations and other tools needed to fully implement the legislation were introduced through the month of September 2009, as part of a ten step plan to bring the GEA to life. The GEA will attempt to expedite the growth of clean, renewable sources of energy, like wind, solar, hydro, biomass and biogas, with the ambition to make Ontario become North America's leader in renewable energy.\nSpecifically this would be attempted by, creating a [[Feed-in Tariff]] that guarantees specific rates for energy generated from renewable sources, establishing the right to connect to the electricity grid for renewable energy projects that meet technical, economic and other regulatory requirements, establishing a one stop streamlined approvals process, providing service guarantees for renewable energy projects that meet regulatory requirements, and hopefully implementing a 21st-century \"smart\" power grid to support the development of new renewable energy projects, which may prepare Ontario for new technologies like electric cars.\n\n==Integrated Power System Plan (IPSP)==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"width:400px; margin:1em; font-size:80%; border:1px solid black; float:right;\"\n|+ 2006 Existing Installed Generation Capacity.<ref>IESO 2006.

Dubin, Colin M. Long. 2004. ''The California Electricity Crisis: What, Why, and What's Next''.  Boston: Kluwer Academic Publishers.</ref>\n\nCentrally planned systems are usually accompanied by a regulatory framework intended to restrict or replace competition with administrative restraints on profits. In Ontario, electricity rates were typically set by [[Ontario Hydro]] as an approximation to its long-run average cost of service, plus a mark up to recover capital investment costs, although rates were never subject to formal approval by the Ontario Energy Board.\n\n[[Howard Hampton]], former leader of the [[Ontario New Democratic Party]], argues that this averaging out of the cost of power ensures supply meets demand in a cost-effective manner. For example, to ensure overall system reliability, a considerable portion of generation capacity from peaking plants must remain idle most of the time. Operating costs for peaking plants, however, are usually expensive because they inefficiently convert costly fossil fuels to electricity.<ref name=\"Cicchetti, Dubin 2004\">Cicchetti, Dubin, and Long. 2004. ''The California Electricity Crisis''.</ref>\n\nIn Ontario's public monopoly system, costs were averaged out between base load and peaking stations. In other words, the insurance cost of reliability is spread out and shared equitably by all customers. Under a deregulated system, in which each generating station \"must stand on its own two financial feet\", the cost of ensuring such reliability would be considerably higher, as peaking plants would charge as much as the market will bear, as they are rationally expected to do.<ref>Hampton, Howard. 2003.  ''Public Power: The Fight for Publicly Owned Electricity''.  Toronto: Insomniac Press.</ref>\n\nThose who defend the combination of traditional regulation and central planning for the electricity sector, like Hampton, often base their arguments on the basic premise that electricity is an essential good required for consumer well-being. According to Hampton, central planning and regulation are required to ensure reliability in both the supply and delivery and the generation and infrastructure aspects.<ref>Hampton. 2003.  ''Public Power''.</ref> Whereas planning under a market regime is profit-driven, central planning can ensure that Ontario's best interests are being attended to and not just the interests of private investors. Stephan Schott, for example, has stated that, at least theoretically, state ownership of the electricity sector could satisfy all of the criteria for socially efficient and environmentally sustainable electricity production. This includes fully internalizing external social costs of electricity production and pricing electricity according to demand fluctuations, even while maintaining stable supply.<ref>Schott, Stephan. 2005. \"Sustainable and Socially Efficient Electricity Production: How Will Ontario Satisfy the Criteria?\". In ''Canadian Energy Policy and the Struggle for Sustainable Development'', ed. G. Bruce Doern, 174\u2013199. Toronto: University of Toronto Press.</ref>\n\nCentral planning, however, is not without limitations.  Central planning has the disadvantage of the risk of political interference. The tendency for governments has been to avoid creating policies that could make electricity consumption more expensive or that would require citizen to adjust their consumption habits.\nFurthermore, central planning, which seeks to improve economies of scale, has historically \"led to a nearly universal strategy of rapid capacity expansion and promotion of demand growth, with little consideration of the necessity or efficiency of energy use\".<ref>Swisher, Jannuzzi, and Redlinger. 1997. ''Tools and Methods for Integrated Resource Planning''.</ref> This is true of Ontario Hydro, which, faced with the threat of cheap natural gas in the late 1950s, made the ill-fated decision to protect its market share by encouraging consumers to use more electricity. Ontario Hydro was forced to build new, more expensive generating plants and transmission and distribution infrastructure to keep up with demand.\n\nAlthough signs were present by the early 1970s indicating that consumer demand growth was falling, Wayne Skene argues that \"Ontario Hydro's board and management had remained locked in megaproject mode, persisting in the belief that demand would continue to double every decade\".<ref>S'' Delusions of Power: Vanity, Folly, and the Uncertain Future of Canada's Hydro Giants ''kene, W. 1997.

Ronald Daniels and Michael Trebilcock, for example, argue that a premium should be placed on incrementalism and decentralization in terms of decision-making, rather than planning for \"some once-and-for-all, system-wide set of collective decisions as to the future of the [electricity] industry\". Moreover, they argue that competitive markets have the added advantage of being able to rely on the knowledge and expertise possessed by investors to generate a more rational assessment of the alleged merits of a given project.<ref>Daniels, Ronald J., and Michael J. Trebilcock. 1996. \"The Future of Ontario Hydro: A Review of Structural and Regulatory Options\". In ''Ontario Hydro at the Millennium: Has Monopoly's Moment Passed'', ed. Ronald J. Daniels, 1\u201352. Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press.</ref>\n\nDeregulation would ensure that rates would no longer be based on long-term average costs, as determined by a central regulating entity, to pricing based on short-term [[marginal cost]]s. A plant's marginal cost varies considerably based on age, technology, fuel conversion efficiency, and so on. Both regulated and deregulated systems operate to minimize the avoidable costs of meeting instantaneous demand.\n\nAs demand is communicated to a power system dispatcher, this least-cost operating principle requires the dispatcher to first employ plants with the lowest marginal costs.<ref name=\"Cicchetti, Dubin 2004\"/> In other words, rates in a deregulated system are \"determined by hungry competitors contending for the last megawatt of demand in a market that clears every five minutes\".<ref>Grant, John. 2002. Ontario's new electricity market.  ''Policy Options'' May\u2013June: 56\u201362.</ref> Eliminating average cost of service rates creates the need for a market to determine electricity rates.\n\nThe term restructuring generally refers to the creation of these markets and the disintegration of vertically integrated utilities.<ref name=\"Considine, Timothy J. 2007\">Considine, Timothy J., and Andrew N. Kleit. 2007. \"Can Electricity Restructuring Survive? Lessons from California and Pennsylvania.\"  In ''Electric choice: deregulation and the future of electric power'', ed. Andrew N. Kleit, 9\u201337. Oakland: The Independent Institute.</ref> The theoretical gains from restructuring are numerous. Competition, coupled with freeing electricity generators from cost of service rates, ought to give generators powerful incentives to cut costs, which will lower consumer prices in the long-term.<ref name=\"Considine, Timothy J. 2007\"/> In other words, deregulation is said to subject the electricity sector to the \"innovative and productive forces of competition\".<ref>Grant. 2002. Ontario's new electricity market.</ref>\n\nCompetition would require generating facilities to assume a much tougher stance in negotiating contracts for fuel sources, labour, and maintenance. It would also require utilities to focus on innovation to increase technological efficiency in order to remain competitive. In addition, Timothy Considine and Andrew Kleit argue that competition would improve the efficiency of allocating electricity.<ref>Considine, and Kleit. 2007. \"Can Electricity Restructuring Survive? Lessons from California and Pennsylvania.</ref>\n\nAs Don Dewees explains, investors in a competitive market will build new capacity when they expect to recover \"all capital and operating costs from the expected markets price. If market prices will not cover the cost of the investment, that investment is socially excessive\".<ref>Dewees, Don N. 2005. \"Electricity restructuring in Canada.\"  In ''Canadian Energy Policy and the Struggle for Sustainable Development'', ed. G. Bruce Doern, 174\u2013199. Toronto: University of Toronto Press.</ref> In theory, this particular aspect of deregulation should correct the systemic over-expansionary tendencies of centrally planned regimes.\n\nHowever, competitive markets are not without limitations. Basic economic theory dictates that for competition to exist, a large number of market participants are required. Experience with deregulation in the United States and the United Kingdom, however, has shown that competitive markets can lead to market power concentration and [[market manipulation]]. In these jurisdictions, the market has been threatened by the strategic behaviour of incumbents and new entrants that have too large a market share.<ref>Schott, Stephan. 2005. \"Sustainable and Socially Efficient Electricity Production\"</ref> The case of [[California electricity crisis|Enron in California]] is a prime example. For a competitive market to function, firms cannot significantly influence prices by adjusting or shutting down supply individually.\n\nFurthermore, the promise of competitive markets to lower consumer prices, for the most part, has yet to materialize. Data from the United States, for example, indicates that while [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Connecticut]] have fairly stable residential prices since restructuring, most other states have witnessed price increases after the year 2000.<ref>Palmer, Karen and Dallas Burtraw. 2005.  ''The environmental impacts of electricity restructuring: looking back and looking forward''. Discussion Paper RF DP 05-07. Washington, D.C.: RFF. www.rff.org/Documents/RFF-DP-05-07.pdf . Retrieved 16 March 2007.</ref> While this may be good news in terms of conservation and demand-side management (C&DM) objectives, it has made competitive markets unpopular among consumers and politically troublesome. For example, as consumer prices rose during Ontario's experiment with deregulation, Premier [[Ernie Eves]], under surmounting political pressure, intervened into the market by freezing retail prices in November 2002.\n\nThis is because electricity is different from all other products in that it must be produced and distributed at the exact moment that it is consumed, and in that it is essential for the functioning of a modern, industrial nation. Thus a market in electricity does not respond in the same way as the market for products which can be stored, whose purchase can be deferred, or which are not essential. Naing Win Oo and V. Miranda<ref>Naing Win Oo and V. Miranda ''Multi-energy Retail Market Simulation with Intelligent Agents'' www.science.smith.edu/~jcardell/Readings/Agents/Miranda.pdf</ref> used intelligent agent simulation to show that in moving from a vertically integrated to a competitive electricity market, retail consumers were heavily disadvantaged and suppliers used this to steadily increase both prices and profits. This occurred even with a large number of suppliers, and in the absence of any active collusion between them. However, in practice collusion and exploitative behavior by suppliers have been found in real markets when they have been deregulated. [[S. David Freeman]], who was appointed Chair of the California Power Authority in the midst of the power crisis in that state, testified on Enron's role in creating the crisis to the Subcommittee on Consumer Affairs, Foreign Commerce and Tourism of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation on 15 May 2002:<ref name=\"FreemanMay2002\">{{cite web|url=http://commerce.senate.gov/hearings/051502freeman.pdf |format=PDF |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20021213024643/http%3A//commerce%2Esenate%2Egov/hearings/051502freeman%2Epdf |archivedate= 13 December 2002 |title=Testimony of S.

It cannot be stored, it cannot be seen, and we cannot do without it, which makes opportunities to take advantage of a deregulated market endless. It is a public good that must be protected from private abuse. If Murphy's Law were written for a market approach to electricity, then the law would state 'any system that can be gamed, will be gamed, and at the worst possible time.' And a market approach for electricity is inherently gameable. Never again can we allow private interests to create artificial or even real shortages and to be in control.\n</blockquote>\n\nMarket manipulation for private profit thus creates government intervention into the marketplace.  This intervention, although certainly supported by electricity consumers, creates doubt in the minds of potential investors, who then begin to question the government's commitment to restructuring. An unattractive environment for private investors, in turn, threatens overall supply in a competitive market regime, as planning for and building new generating capacity becomes an increasing risk.<ref name=\"Trebilcock 2005 123 146\"/> This is why some supporters of restructuring, like Dewees, admit \"[t]he greatest risk to competitive markets may not be power shortages or heat waves but government intervention&nbsp;...\"<ref>Dewees. 2005. \"Electricity restructuring in Canada\".</ref>\n\n==Conservation and demand management==\nElectricity use can be divided into three main sectors:<ref>Natural Resources Canada. 2006.

Residential demand is projected to decline slightly.\n* Commercial sector: this includes mainly space heating, and cooling, as well as commercial and office lighting. This sector accounts for about 39% of Ontario's total electricity consumption and is projected to grow the most.\n* Industrial sector: this includes manufacturing activities, mining activities, forestry and construction. Industrial consumers account for approximately 28% of electricity consumed in Ontario. This consumption is projected to remain stable.\n\nElectricity demand can also be separated as base load and peak demand. Base load refers to constant, or unvarying, demand for electricity. In Ontario, base load amounts to approximately 13,000 MW and is met by nuclear and hydroelectric power. These supply options generally have low operating costs. Nuclear stations are limited in their capability to rapidly change their output. Hydroelectric stations can rapidly change their output and are typically used to adjust grid supply to match instantaneous demand.\n\nPeak demand refers to fluctuating, or varying, needs for electricity above and beyond base load levels. Added to this base load, the peak load raises Ontario's maximum electricity demand to 27,000 MW. This peak is typically met by oil/natural gas-fired, coal and select hydro-electric power plants. These plants can respond to changes in demand rapidly, but have higher operating costs.\n\nAverage demand in Ontario is currently 17,500 MW.<ref>CFI Consulting Company. 2005.

A recent trend has developed whereby summer peak demand has grown to outpace winter peak loads.<ref>CFI Consulting Company. 2005. Electricity Demand in Ontario \u2013 A Retrospective Analysis. Prepared for Chief Conservation Officer, OPA. November.</ref> This is primarily the result of increasingly warm summer conditions. The highest load recorded in Ontario occurred on 1 August 2006, when peak demand for electricity reached 27,005 MW. The highest winter peak demand occurred 13 February 2007, when peak demand was 25,868 MW.\n\nPeak demand also varies by the time of day. The daily peak period refers to the time of the day when demand is at its high. In winter, there are generally two peaking periods: around 10:30&nbsp;a.m. in the morning and around 6&nbsp;p.m. in the evening. In summer months, demand peaks in the late afternoon, when temperatures are at their hottest.\n\n===Current and expected future electricity demand===\nCurrent annual electricity demand in Ontario is 151 TWh.<ref>Ontario Power Authority. 2005. Supply Mix Advice Report. Part 1-1: Supply Mix Summary</ref> In other words, on average, Ontarians consume 12,750&nbsp;kWh per person per year. Based on 2003 information, this figure is approximately 25% lower than the Canadian average, roughly equal to U.S. rates, and about twice as high as European consumption levels (see: [[List of countries by electricity consumption|electricity consumption by country]]). In order to supply such demand, Ontario counts on 31,000 MW of installed power capacity, broken down as follows: 37% nuclear, 26% renewable (including hydro-electric power), 16% natural gas and 21% coal.\n\nTotal electricity demand has been increasing in Ontario over the last decades. In particular, during the period 1993\u20132004, it increased at a rate of approximately 0.5%.<ref name=\"conservationbureau.on.ca\">CFI Consulting Company. 2005.

[http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census/index.cfm http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census/index.cfm]</ref> This considerable growth offsets the effects of reduced per capita consumption in Ontario, and results in overall increased electricity consumption.\n* Economic growth: Ontario's GDP growth has varied between 2% and 3% in recent years, and is expected to average 3.0% over the next few years.<ref>Ontario Ministry of Finance. 2006.

However, structural changes are occurring in the province's economy, particularly the decline of heavy manufacturing and increase in service and knowledge sectors, which will result in reduced industrial electricity demand overall.\n* Electricity prices: As of Sept 10, 2016, Electricity rates in Ontario are among the highest in North America.<ref>http://www.ontario-hydro.com/</ref><ref>http://www.900chml.com/2016/08/11/ontarians-now-pay-the-highest-electricity-rates-in-north-america/</ref>\n* Conservation and Demand Management (C&DM) practices: C&DM initiatives can significantly reduce electricity demand. Conservation can result in improved productivity, lower energy bills and price fluctuations, as well reduced environmental impacts.\n\nAll of the above variables affect the forecasting of future electricity demand. The uncertainty embedded in these factors accumulates and makes it difficult to determine how much electricity will be consumed in the future.\n\nIn its 2005 [https://web.archive.org/web/20070329063915/http://www.powerauthority.on.ca/Report_Static/1140.htm ''Supply Mix Advice Report''], the OPA estimated that electricity demand will grow at a rate of 0.9% annually between 2006 and 2025, rising to approximately 170 TWh per year by 2025. This OPA estimate is nearly double the actual rate of electricity demand growth between 1990 and 2003 of 0.5% per year. In fact, the rate of growth in electricity demand in Ontario has been in decline since 1950.<ref name=\"conservationbureau.on.ca\"/> This was a result of the structural changes in the Ontario economy over this period, particularly the decline of heavy manufacturing and increased growth in the service and knowledge sectors.\n\nThe OPA projections are controversial.

When talking about electricity, it is often referred to as Conservation and Demand Management (C&DM or CDM), as it aims to reduce electricity demand, either by using more efficient technologies or by changing wasteful habits. C&DM also addresses reductions in peak demand via Demand Response (DR) programs. Demand Response does not lower total electricity demand; rather, it shifts demand out of the peak times.\n\nEconomically rational and technically feasible conservation is considered by some to be the cheapest, cleanest way to bridge the gap between supply and demand.<ref>Lovins, Amory. 1989.

Moreover, the implementation of aggressive C&DM mechanisms would lower consumers' bills while increasing the province's energy productivity. Ontario's economy currently reflects relatively low electricity productivity levels, measured as GDP per electricity use. The state of New York has an electricity productivity rate that is 2.3 times higher than that of Ontario.<ref>Gibbons, Jack. 2006.

The health concerns associated with other fossil fuels (see coal above) make them less suitable for areas with high population densities.\n\nCogeneration can dramatically increase the efficiency of fuel use, as 48\u201364% of the energy from conventional combustion can be recovered as heat, while only 25\u201337% is converted into power. The combined efficiency of heat and power use can be up to 91%.<ref>Havelsky, V. 1999. Energetic efficiency of cogeneration systems for combined heat, cold and power production.  ''International Journal of Refrigeration ''22: 479\u2013485''.''</ref> High efficiencies translate into much lower fuel costs as well as much lower [greenhouse gas] and other emissions.\n\nThere are 110 CHP generating plants currently in operation in Ontario, with a total capacity of approximately 2,300 MW. Of these, 82 burn natural gas and the rest use biomass. Only 50 of these facilities are connected to the grid.

Policymakers are presented with a range of policy choices in addressing the situation, both in terms of overall system design and structure, and specific electricity generating technologies.\n\nOntario finds itself faced with choices that define energy policy debates throughout the western world: the role of markets vs. centralized planning and what [[Amory Lovins]] has termed [[soft energy path|\"hard\" versus \"soft energy paths\"]]; i.e. continued reliance on large, centralized generation, particularly nuclear and coal, or moving towards decentralized technologies, including energy efficiency and low impact renewables.

From this early beginning until the postwar economic boom of the 1950s, Ontario Hydro was able to meet growing demand for electricity by expanding its network of hydraulic generating facilities.<ref>Ontario (Porter Commission). The Report of the Royal Commission on Electric Power Planning: Volume 1, Concepts, Conclusions and Recommendations, p.27; See also: Ontario Power Authority, Supply Mix Advice Report, Background Report, Volume 3</ref> Planning for Ontario's electricity system was relatively simple for two reasons: 1) electricity was coming almost entirely from hydroelectric power; and 2) the electricity system consisted of several smaller systems, making management considerably easier.\n\nChallenges to the system began to emerge in the 1950s: the accessible waterpower sites were exploited; and the province's electricity distribution system was limited in capacity. To address these problems, the HEC began constructing new coal-fired electricity generation plants near major sources of electricity demand and launched plans to build nuclear power plants across the province of Ontario. Between the early 1970s and early 1990s twenty [[CANDU]] power reactors were brought into service at the Pickering (8 reactors), Bruce (8 reactors) and Darlington (4 reactors) nuclear generating facilities.\n\n===Electricity demand planning 1970s\u20131990s===\nThe Power Corporation Act required Ontario Hydro, (formerly HEPCO, renamed in 1974) to provide \"power at cost\". This philosophy became part of the culture and lore of electricity supply in Ontario. The utility did not pay taxes, nor was it intended to generate profits.<ref>Dewess, Don. 2005. \"Electricity Restructuring and Regulation in the Provinces: Ontario and Beyond\", Presented to the Energy, Sustainability and Integration, The CCGES Transatlantic Energy Conference.</ref>\n\n====Porter Commission====\nAmid growing concern over the cost of nuclear power, coupled with inflation and recessions that reduced the demand for electricity, the Porter Commission (1975\u20131979) performed a detailed review on the problem of electricity supply. The Porter Commission's conclusions were simple: demand management, not supply planning, must be the focus of Ontario electricity planning.<ref>Howard Hampton. 2003. ''Public Power: The Fight for Publicly Owned Electricity''. Toronto: Insomniac Press, p.130.</ref>\n\n====Demand/Supply Plan (DSP) Report==== \nIt was not until 1989, however, that Ontario Hydro published its first Demand/Supply Plan (DSP) Report, \"Providing the Balance of Power\". The plan projected a supply/demand gap would open up in the mid-1990s, reaching 9,700 MW by 2005 and 21,300 MW by 2014. To address this gap, Ontario Hydro proposed building several additional nuclear and coal-fired generation plants.<ref>Ontario Hydro. 1989. ''Providing the Balance of Power: Ontario Hydro's Plan to Serve Customers Electricity Needs''. Toronto: Ontario Hydro.</ref> In 1992, Ontario Hydro issued a revised Supply/Demand Plan Report.<ref>Ontario Hydro. 1992. ''Providing Balance of Power: Update 1992''. Toronto: Ontario Hydro.</ref> As a public body, all Ontario Hydro projects, including the DSP, were subject to the province's Environmental Assessment Act. By 1993, however, faced with increasing criticism from the province's independent, quasi-judicial Environmental Assessment Board, a recession and economic restructuring that dramatically reduced industrial electricity demand, and an oversupply of electricity as the Darlington nuclear power plant came into service, the DSP was withdrawn by Ontario Hydro and no additional generating facilities were built.\n\n===Ontario's short experiment with competitive retail markets===\nIn the 1990s, Ontario Hydro's enormous debt from the building of the [[Darlington Nuclear Generating Station|Darlington nuclear generating station]] became a major political issue. Ontario Hydro was becoming financially and operationally dysfunctional. The situation forced Ontario Hydro to dramatically reduce staff and transmission investments. Ontario Hydro also published a document called Hydro 21.<ref>Ontario Power Authority. 2006. ''Supply Mix Advice Report, Background Report'', p.6.</ref> This report suggested that electricity system in Ontario should be restructured in a more market oriented direction.\n\nThe political impetus for restructuring increased with the 1995 election of the [[Mike Harris]] government. In that year, Mike Harris commissioned the Macdonald Committee. The committee recommended the elimination of Ontario Hydro's monopoly on managing generation capacity and that the electricity market be opened up to competition. In response to the Macdonald Committee's recommendations, the Ontario government released \"Direction for Change: Charting a Course for Competitive Electricity and Jobs in Ontario\" in 1997, detailing the government's plans to open the market for electricity supply.\n\nThe competitive market did not actually open until May 2002. Participation in the retail market was voluntary, with customers having the option of entering into contracts or rates being set in the five-minute spot market. Retail consumers were also free to enter fixed-rate contracts. For those that opted out of the contract option, electricity rates passed through a smoothed spot market price. When the market opened in May, wholesale prices averaged 3.01 cents per kWh. For a number of reasons, however, including an especially hot summer, a reduction in domestic generating capacity, and an increasing reliance on a limited import capacity, prices began to rise sharply. In July, average wholesale price was 6.2 cents per kWh.<ref name=\"Trebilcock 2005 123 146\">Trebilcock, Michael .J. and Roy Hrab. 2005. Electricity restructuring in Ontario.

Transmission and distribution rates were also frozen at their existing levels and would remain unchanged until 1 May 2006. The net result was a complete cessation of new investment in generation capacity and a significant cutback in new investment in transmission and distribution.\n\n====Concerns regarding aging nuclear plants====\nIn 1996, major questions arose regarding the status of Ontario's nuclear plants. The oldest of these plants built in the 1970s were aging and in the early 1990s reliability began to decline significantly. The situation drew the attention of the federal nuclear regulator, the Atomic Energy Control Board of Canada (AECB) (now Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission), and was acknowledged by Ontario Hydro. In 1996, the AECB judged the situation at Pickering A to be particularly critical and issued the plant a six-month operating license. The following year a review board of industry experts concluded that the operations of Ontario's nuclear plants were \"below standard\" and \"minimally acceptable\". The Ontario government responded by approving a Nuclear Asset Optimization Plan proposed by Ontario Hydro. The plan had three major objectives: 1) the closure of the seven oldest of the utility's 19 operational nuclear reactors for rehabilitation; 2) the redeployment of staff; and 3) the spending of between $5 and $8 billion to implement the plan.<ref>Ministry of Energy. 2007.

Boston: Kluwer Academic Publishers.</ref>\n\nCentrally planned systems are usually accompanied by a regulatory framework intended to restrict or replace competition with administrative restraints on profits. In Ontario, electricity rates were typically set by [[Ontario Hydro]] as an approximation to its long-run average cost of service, plus a mark up to recover capital investment costs, although rates were never subject to formal approval by the Ontario Energy Board.\n\n[[Howard Hampton]], former leader of the [[Ontario New Democratic Party]], argues that this averaging out of the cost of power ensures supply meets demand in a cost-effective manner. For example, to ensure overall system reliability, a considerable portion of generation capacity from peaking plants must remain idle most of the time. Operating costs for peaking plants, however, are usually expensive because they inefficiently convert costly fossil fuels to electricity.<ref name=\"Cicchetti, Dubin 2004\">Cicchetti, Dubin, and Long. 2004. ''The California Electricity Crisis''.</ref>\n\nIn Ontario's public monopoly system, costs were averaged out between base load and peaking stations. In other words, the insurance cost of reliability is spread out and shared equitably by all customers. Under a deregulated system, in which each generating station \"must stand on its own two financial feet\", the cost of ensuring such reliability would be considerably higher, as peaking plants would charge as much as the market will bear, as they are rationally expected to do.<ref>Hampton, Howard. 2003.  ''Public Power: The Fight for Publicly Owned Electricity''.  Toronto: Insomniac Press.</ref>\n\nThose who defend the combination of traditional regulation and central planning for the electricity sector, like Hampton, often base their arguments on the basic premise that electricity is an essential good required for consumer well-being. According to Hampton, central planning and regulation are required to ensure reliability in both the supply and delivery and the generation and infrastructure aspects.<ref>Hampton. 2003.  ''Public Power''.</ref> Whereas planning under a market regime is profit-driven, central planning can ensure that Ontario's best interests are being attended to and not just the interests of private investors. Stephan Schott, for example, has stated that, at least theoretically, state ownership of the electricity sector could satisfy all of the criteria for socially efficient and environmentally sustainable electricity production. This includes fully internalizing external social costs of electricity production and pricing electricity according to demand fluctuations, even while maintaining stable supply.<ref>Schott, Stephan. 2005. \"Sustainable and Socially Efficient Electricity Production: How Will Ontario Satisfy the Criteria?\".

The tendency for governments has been to avoid creating policies that could make electricity consumption more expensive or that would require citizen to adjust their consumption habits.\nFurthermore, central planning, which seeks to improve economies of scale, has historically \"led to a nearly universal strategy of rapid capacity expansion and promotion of demand growth, with little consideration of the necessity or efficiency of energy use\".<ref>Swisher, Jannuzzi, and Redlinger. 1997. ''Tools and Methods for Integrated Resource Planning''.</ref> This is true of Ontario Hydro, which, faced with the threat of cheap natural gas in the late 1950s, made the ill-fated decision to protect its market share by encouraging consumers to use more electricity. Ontario Hydro was forced to build new, more expensive generating plants and transmission and distribution infrastructure to keep up with demand.\n\nAlthough signs were present by the early 1970s indicating that consumer demand growth was falling, Wayne Skene argues that \"Ontario Hydro's board and management had remained locked in megaproject mode, persisting in the belief that demand would continue to double every decade\".<ref>S'' Delusions of Power: Vanity, Folly, and the Uncertain Future of Canada's Hydro Giants ''kene, W. 1997.

Ronald Daniels and Michael Trebilcock, for example, argue that a premium should be placed on incrementalism and decentralization in terms of decision-making, rather than planning for \"some once-and-for-all, system-wide set of collective decisions as to the future of the [electricity] industry\". Moreover, they argue that competitive markets have the added advantage of being able to rely on the knowledge and expertise possessed by investors to generate a more rational assessment of the alleged merits of a given project.<ref>Daniels, Ronald J., and Michael J.

A plant's marginal cost varies considerably based on age, technology, fuel conversion efficiency, and so on. Both regulated and deregulated systems operate to minimize the avoidable costs of meeting instantaneous demand.\n\nAs demand is communicated to a power system dispatcher, this least-cost operating principle requires the dispatcher to first employ plants with the lowest marginal costs.<ref name=\"Cicchetti, Dubin 2004\"/> In other words, rates in a deregulated system are \"determined by hungry competitors contending for the last megawatt of demand in a market that clears every five minutes\".<ref>Grant, John. 2002.

''Policy Options'' May\u2013June: 56\u201362.</ref> Eliminating average cost of service rates creates the need for a market to determine electricity rates.\n\nThe term restructuring generally refers to the creation of these markets and the disintegration of vertically integrated utilities.<ref name=\"Considine, Timothy J. 2007\">Considine, Timothy J., and Andrew N.

Kleit, 9\u201337. Oakland: The Independent Institute.</ref> The theoretical gains from restructuring are numerous. Competition, coupled with freeing electricity generators from cost of service rates, ought to give generators powerful incentives to cut costs, which will lower consumer prices in the long-term.<ref name=\"Considine, Timothy J. 2007\"/> In other words, deregulation is said to subject the electricity sector to the \"innovative and productive forces of competition\".<ref>Grant. 2002. Ontario's new electricity market.</ref>\n\nCompetition would require generating facilities to assume a much tougher stance in negotiating contracts for fuel sources, labour, and maintenance. It would also require utilities to focus on innovation to increase technological efficiency in order to remain competitive. In addition, Timothy Considine and Andrew Kleit argue that competition would improve the efficiency of allocating electricity.<ref>Considine, and Kleit. 2007. \"Can Electricity Restructuring Survive? Lessons from California and Pennsylvania.</ref>\n\nAs Don Dewees explains, investors in a competitive market will build new capacity when they expect to recover \"all capital and operating costs from the expected markets price. If market prices will not cover the cost of the investment, that investment is socially excessive\".<ref>Dewees, Don N. 2005. \"Electricity restructuring in Canada.\"  In ''Canadian Energy Policy and the Struggle for Sustainable Development'', ed.

Toronto: University of Toronto Press.</ref> In theory, this particular aspect of deregulation should correct the systemic over-expansionary tendencies of centrally planned regimes.\n\nHowever, competitive markets are not without limitations. Basic economic theory dictates that for competition to exist, a large number of market participants are required. Experience with deregulation in the United States and the United Kingdom, however, has shown that competitive markets can lead to market power concentration and [[market manipulation]]. In these jurisdictions, the market has been threatened by the strategic behaviour of incumbents and new entrants that have too large a market share.<ref>Schott, Stephan. 2005. \"Sustainable and Socially Efficient Electricity Production\"</ref> The case of [[California electricity crisis|Enron in California]] is a prime example. For a competitive market to function, firms cannot significantly influence prices by adjusting or shutting down supply individually.\n\nFurthermore, the promise of competitive markets to lower consumer prices, for the most part, has yet to materialize. Data from the United States, for example, indicates that while [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Connecticut]] have fairly stable residential prices since restructuring, most other states have witnessed price increases after the year 2000.<ref>Palmer, Karen and Dallas Burtraw. 2005.

Retrieved 16 March 2007.</ref> While this may be good news in terms of conservation and demand-side management (C&DM) objectives, it has made competitive markets unpopular among consumers and politically troublesome. For example, as consumer prices rose during Ontario's experiment with deregulation, Premier [[Ernie Eves]], under surmounting political pressure, intervened into the market by freezing retail prices in November 2002.\n\nThis is because electricity is different from all other products in that it must be produced and distributed at the exact moment that it is consumed, and in that it is essential for the functioning of a modern, industrial nation. Thus a market in electricity does not respond in the same way as the market for products which can be stored, whose purchase can be deferred, or which are not essential. Naing Win Oo and V. Miranda<ref>Naing Win Oo and V. Miranda ''Multi-energy Retail Market Simulation with Intelligent Agents'' www.science.smith.edu/~jcardell/Readings/Agents/Miranda.pdf</ref> used intelligent agent simulation to show that in moving from a vertically integrated to a competitive electricity market, retail consumers were heavily disadvantaged and suppliers used this to steadily increase both prices and profits. This occurred even with a large number of suppliers, and in the absence of any active collusion between them. However, in practice collusion and exploitative behavior by suppliers have been found in real markets when they have been deregulated. [[S. David Freeman]], who was appointed Chair of the California Power Authority in the midst of the power crisis in that state, testified on Enron's role in creating the crisis to the Subcommittee on Consumer Affairs, Foreign Commerce and Tourism of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation on 15 May 2002:<ref name=\"FreemanMay2002\">{{cite web|url=http://commerce.senate.gov/hearings/051502freeman.pdf |format=PDF |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20021213024643/http%3A//commerce%2Esenate%2Egov/hearings/051502freeman%2Epdf |archivedate= 13 December 2002 |title=Testimony of S.

It cannot be stored, it cannot be seen, and we cannot do without it, which makes opportunities to take advantage of a deregulated market endless. It is a public good that must be protected from private abuse. If Murphy's Law were written for a market approach to electricity, then the law would state 'any system that can be gamed, will be gamed, and at the worst possible time.' And a market approach for electricity is inherently gameable. Never again can we allow private interests to create artificial or even real shortages and to be in control.\n</blockquote>\n\nMarket manipulation for private profit thus creates government intervention into the marketplace.  This intervention, although certainly supported by electricity consumers, creates doubt in the minds of potential investors, who then begin to question the government's commitment to restructuring. An unattractive environment for private investors, in turn, threatens overall supply in a competitive market regime, as planning for and building new generating capacity becomes an increasing risk.<ref name=\"Trebilcock 2005 123 146\"/> This is why some supporters of restructuring, like Dewees, admit \"[t]he greatest risk to competitive markets may not be power shortages or heat waves but government intervention&nbsp;...\"<ref>Dewees. 2005. \"Electricity restructuring in Canada\".</ref>\n\n==Conservation and demand management==\nElectricity use can be divided into three main sectors:<ref>Natural Resources Canada. 2006.

Residential demand is projected to decline slightly.\n* Commercial sector: this includes mainly space heating, and cooling, as well as commercial and office lighting. This sector accounts for about 39% of Ontario's total electricity consumption and is projected to grow the most.\n* Industrial sector: this includes manufacturing activities, mining activities, forestry and construction. Industrial consumers account for approximately 28% of electricity consumed in Ontario. This consumption is projected to remain stable.\n\nElectricity demand can also be separated as base load and peak demand. Base load refers to constant, or unvarying, demand for electricity. In Ontario, base load amounts to approximately 13,000 MW and is met by nuclear and hydroelectric power. These supply options generally have low operating costs. Nuclear stations are limited in their capability to rapidly change their output. Hydroelectric stations can rapidly change their output and are typically used to adjust grid supply to match instantaneous demand.\n\nPeak demand refers to fluctuating, or varying, needs for electricity above and beyond base load levels. Added to this base load, the peak load raises Ontario's maximum electricity demand to 27,000 MW. This peak is typically met by oil/natural gas-fired, coal and select hydro-electric power plants. These plants can respond to changes in demand rapidly, but have higher operating costs.\n\nAverage demand in Ontario is currently 17,500 MW.<ref>CFI Consulting Company. 2005.

A recent trend has developed whereby summer peak demand has grown to outpace winter peak loads.<ref>CFI Consulting Company. 2005. Electricity Demand in Ontario \u2013 A Retrospective Analysis. Prepared for Chief Conservation Officer, OPA. November.</ref> This is primarily the result of increasingly warm summer conditions. The highest load recorded in Ontario occurred on 1 August 2006, when peak demand for electricity reached 27,005 MW. The highest winter peak demand occurred 13 February 2007, when peak demand was 25,868 MW.\n\nPeak demand also varies by the time of day. The daily peak period refers to the time of the day when demand is at its high. In winter, there are generally two peaking periods: around 10:30&nbsp;a.m. in the morning and around 6&nbsp;p.m. in the evening. In summer months, demand peaks in the late afternoon, when temperatures are at their hottest.\n\n===Current and expected future electricity demand===\nCurrent annual electricity demand in Ontario is 151 TWh.<ref>Ontario Power Authority. 2005. Supply Mix Advice Report. Part 1-1: Supply Mix Summary</ref> In other words, on average, Ontarians consume 12,750&nbsp;kWh per person per year. Based on 2003 information, this figure is approximately 25% lower than the Canadian average, roughly equal to U.S. rates, and about twice as high as European consumption levels (see: [[List of countries by electricity consumption|electricity consumption by country]]). In order to supply such demand, Ontario counts on 31,000 MW of installed power capacity, broken down as follows: 37% nuclear, 26% renewable (including hydro-electric power), 16% natural gas and 21% coal.\n\nTotal electricity demand has been increasing in Ontario over the last decades. In particular, during the period 1993\u20132004, it increased at a rate of approximately 0.5%.<ref name=\"conservationbureau.on.ca\">CFI Consulting Company. 2005.

[http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census/index.cfm http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census/index.cfm]</ref> This considerable growth offsets the effects of reduced per capita consumption in Ontario, and results in overall increased electricity consumption.\n* Economic growth: Ontario's GDP growth has varied between 2% and 3% in recent years, and is expected to average 3.0% over the next few years.<ref>Ontario Ministry of Finance. 2006. Ontario Economic Outlook and Fiscal Review [http://www.fin.gov.on.ca/english/budget/fallstatement/2006/06fs-papera.pdf http://www.fin.gov.on.ca/english/budget/fallstatement/2006/06fs-papera.pdf]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Although electricity per unit of GDP has been falling in the past few years,<ref name=\"conservationbureau.on.ca\"/> the total rate of economic growth will result in increased overall demand.

However, structural changes are occurring in the province's economy, particularly the decline of heavy manufacturing and increase in service and knowledge sectors, which will result in reduced industrial electricity demand overall.\n* Electricity prices: As of Sept 10, 2016, Electricity rates in Ontario are among the highest in North America.<ref>http://www.ontario-hydro.com/</ref><ref>http://www.900chml.com/2016/08/11/ontarians-now-pay-the-highest-electricity-rates-in-north-america/</ref>\n* Conservation and Demand Management (C&DM) practices: C&DM initiatives can significantly reduce electricity demand. Conservation can result in improved productivity, lower energy bills and price fluctuations, as well reduced environmental impacts.\n\nAll of the above variables affect the forecasting of future electricity demand. The uncertainty embedded in these factors accumulates and makes it difficult to determine how much electricity will be consumed in the future.\n\nIn its 2005 [https://web.archive.org/web/20070329063915/http://www.powerauthority.on.ca/Report_Static/1140.htm ''Supply Mix Advice Report''], the OPA estimated that electricity demand will grow at a rate of 0.9% annually between 2006 and 2025, rising to approximately 170 TWh per year by 2025. This OPA estimate is nearly double the actual rate of electricity demand growth between 1990 and 2003 of 0.5% per year. In fact, the rate of growth in electricity demand in Ontario has been in decline since 1950.<ref name=\"conservationbureau.on.ca\"/> This was a result of the structural changes in the Ontario economy over this period, particularly the decline of heavy manufacturing and increased growth in the service and knowledge sectors.\n\nThe OPA projections are controversial.

When talking about electricity, it is often referred to as Conservation and Demand Management (C&DM or CDM), as it aims to reduce electricity demand, either by using more efficient technologies or by changing wasteful habits. C&DM also addresses reductions in peak demand via Demand Response (DR) programs. Demand Response does not lower total electricity demand; rather, it shifts demand out of the peak times.\n\nEconomically rational and technically feasible conservation is considered by some to be the cheapest, cleanest way to bridge the gap between supply and demand.<ref>Lovins, Amory. 1989.

Moreover, the implementation of aggressive C&DM mechanisms would lower consumers' bills while increasing the province's energy productivity. Ontario's economy currently reflects relatively low electricity productivity levels, measured as GDP per electricity use. The state of New York has an electricity productivity rate that is 2.3 times higher than that of Ontario.<ref>Gibbons, Jack. 2006.

Moreover, it is vital to develop and use energy efficiency models to accurately estimate energy efficiency potential, to determine the most effective conservation policies, and to set the maximum priority for energy efficiency and conservation.\n\nBased on their estimates of future demand, the OPA has recommended 1,820 MW as a target for peak demand reduction to be achieved by 2025.<ref>Ontario Power Authority. 2005.

Whereas conventional, centralized generation involves few generation facilities connected via high-voltage transmission lines spanning long distances, distributed generation facilities are located close to the load\u2014or in technical speak, on the customer side of the meter\u2014although not necessarily restricted to local uses.<ref>Ackermann, Thomas, Goran Andersson, and Lennart Soder. 2001.

Technologies often associated with distributed generation include cogeneration\u2014also known as [[combined heat and power]] (CHP) generation\u2014as well as [[Gas turbine|micro-turbines]], [[fuel cell]]s, and [[gas generator]]s used for on-site or emergency backup power.\n\n[[Renewable energy|Renewables]] can also be considered distributed technologies, depending on their application. Typically, community [[wind farms]], [[Photovoltaic array|solar photovoltaic arrays]], geothermal installations, and biomass-fuelled power facilities are typically sufficiently limited in their generation capacity that they qualify as distributed energy sources. Conversely, large hydropower plants and offshore wind parks, with substantial production capacities of 50\u2013100 MW or more which feed into high-voltage transmission grids, cannot be considered distributed generation.\n\n===Coal===\nCoal-fired electricity generation is currently inexpensive relative to other energy sources.

Fossil fuels, biomass and biogas can all be used in CHP plants. Transporting heat over long distances is impractical, so cogeneration plants are usually small and located close to the energy load. Hence, cogeneration is inherently linked to distributed generation. The urban location of CHP plants makes them very compatible with clean-burning fuels such as natural gas. The health concerns associated with other fossil fuels (see coal above) make them less suitable for areas with high population densities.\n\nCogeneration can dramatically increase the efficiency of fuel use, as 48\u201364% of the energy from conventional combustion can be recovered as heat, while only 25\u201337% is converted into power.
