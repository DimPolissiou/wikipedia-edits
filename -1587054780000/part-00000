Russia sought to cross Poland in order to stimulate a Europe-wide communist revolution.\n\nPoland's [[Chief of State]], [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]], felt the time was right to expand Polish borders as far east as feasible, to be followed by a Polish-led [[Intermarium]] federation of [[Central and Eastern Europe]]an states, as a bulwark against the re-emergence of German and Russian [[imperialism]]. [[Vladimir Lenin]] saw Poland as the bridge the [[Red Army]] had to cross to assist [[Communism|other Communist movements]] and bring about more European revolutions. By 1919, Polish forces had taken control of much of [[Western Ukraine]], emerging victorious from the [[Polish\u2013Ukrainian War]]. The [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]], led by [[Yevhen Petrushevych]], had tried to create a Ukrainian state on territories to which both Poles and Ukrainians laid claim. In the Russian part of Ukraine [[Symon Petliura]] tried to defend and strengthen the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] but as the [[Bolsheviks]] began to win the [[Russian Civil War]], they started to advance westward towards the disputed Ukrainian territories, causing Petliura's forces to retreat to [[Podolia]]. By the end of 1919, a clear front had formed as Petliura decided to ally with Pi\u0142sudski. Border skirmishes escalated following Pi\u0142sudski's [[Kiev Offensive (1920)|Kiev Offensive]] in April 1920.\n\nThe Polish offensive was met by a successful Red Army [[counter-attack]]. The Soviet operation pushed the Polish forces back westward all the way to the Polish capital, [[Warsaw]], while the [[Directorate of Ukraine]] fled to Western Europe. Western fears of Soviet troops arriving at the German frontiers [[Interallied Mission to Poland|increased the interest of Western powers]] in the war. In mid-summer, the fall of Warsaw seemed certain but in mid-August, the tide had turned again, as the Polish forces achieved an unexpected and decisive victory at the [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|Battle of Warsaw]]. In the wake of the Polish advance eastward, the Soviets sued for peace and the war ended with a [[cease-fire]] on 18 October 1920.\n\nThe [[Peace of Riga]] was signed on 18 March 1921, dividing the disputed territories between Poland and Soviet Russia. The war largely determined the Soviet\u2013Polish border for the [[Interbellum]]. Poland gained a territory of around 200 kilometers east of its former border, the [[Curzon Line]], which had been defined by an international commission after [[World War I]].<ref>{{citation|surname1=Norman Davies|title=Heart of Europe.

The ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' begins its article with the date range 1919\u20131920 but then states, \"Although there had been hostilities between the two countries during 1919, the conflict began when the Polish head of state J\u00f3zef Pilsudski formed an alliance with the Ukrainian nationalist leader Symon Petlyura (21 April 1920) and their combined forces began to overrun Ukraine, occupying Kiev on 7 May.\"<ref group=\"N\" name=\"brit_ruspol\"/> The Polish encyclopaedia [[Internetowa encyklopedia PWN]],<ref name=\"pwn_polbol\"/> as well as Western historians such as [[Norman Davies]], consider 1919 the starting year of the war.<ref name=\"davies_WERS_22\"/>\n\nThe ending date is given as either 1920 or 1921; this confusion stems from the fact that while the [[cease-fire]] was put into force on 18 October 1920, the [[Treaty of Riga|official treaty ending the war]] was signed months later, on 18 March 1921. While the events of 1919 can be described as a border conflict, and only in early 1920 did both sides engage in all-out war, the conflicts that took place in 1920 were an inevitable escalation of fighting that began in earnest a year earlier. In the end, the events of 1920 were a logical, though unforeseen, consequence of the 1919 prelude.<ref name=\"davies_WERS_22\"/>\n\n== Prelude ==\n{{Main|Causes of the Polish\u2013Soviet War}}\n[[File:Rzeczpospolita Rozbiory 3.png|thumb|[[Partitions of Poland]] in 1795: The coloured territories show the extent of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] just before the first partition.

This approach to holding ground harked back to the World War I practice of \"establishing a fortified line of defense\". It had shown some merit on the Western Front saturated with troops, machine guns, and artillery. Poland's eastern front, however, was weakly manned, supported with inadequate artillery, and had almost no fortifications.<ref name=\"Lawrynowicz\" />\n\n[[File:PBW August 1920.png|thumb|250px|Soviet offensive successes, early August 1920]]\nAgainst the Polish line the Red Army gathered its Northwest Front led by the young General [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]].

The 4th, 15th, and 3rd Armies were to push west, supported from the south by the [[Western Army (Russia)|16th Army]] and Mozyr Group. For three days the outcome of the battle hung in the balance, but Soviet numerical superiority proved decisive and by 7 July Polish forces were in full retreat along the entire front. However, due to the stubborn defence by Polish units, Tukhachevsky's plan to break through the front and push the defenders south-west into the [[Pinsk Marshes]] failed.<ref name=\"Lawrynowicz\" />\n[[File:Cooper Fauntleroy.jpg|thumb|left|American volunteer pilots, [[Merian C.

However, the Polish troops were insufficient in number. Soviet forces found a weakly defended part of the front and broke through. Gaj-Chan and Lithuanian forces captured Vilnius on 14 July, forcing the Poles into retreat again. In [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] to the south, General [[Semyon Budyonny]]'s cavalry advanced far into the Polish rear, capturing [[Brody]] and approaching [[Lviv|Lw\u00f3w]] and [[Zamo\u015b\u0107]].

Grodno in Belarus fell on 19 July; Brest-Litovsk fell on 1 August.

The city was soon [[Battle of Lw\u00f3w (1920)|besieged]]. This created a hole in the lines of the Red Army, but at the same time opened the way to the Polish capital.

At Tukhachevsky's insistence the Soviet High Command had ordered the 1st Cavalry Army to march north toward Warsaw and [[Lublin]].

It faced the combined forces of the numerically and materially superior Soviet 3rd and 15th Armies. In one day the Soviet advance toward Warsaw and [[Modlin (Nowy Dw\u00f3r Mazowiecki)|Modlin]] had been halted and soon turned into retreat. Sikorski's 5th Army pushed the exhausted Soviet formations away from Warsaw in a lightning operation. Polish forces advanced at a speed of thirty kilometers a day, soon destroying any Soviet hopes for completing their enveloping manoeuvre in the north. By 16 August, the Polish [[Battle of D\u0119blin and Mi\u0144sk Mazowiecki|counter-offensive]] had been fully joined by Marshal Pi\u0142sudski's \"Reserve Army.\" Precisely executing his plan, the Polish force, [[Battle of D\u0119blin and Mi\u0144sk Mazowiecki|advancing]] from Warsaw (Colonel Wrzali\u0144ski's group) and the south (Polish 3rd and 4 Army), found a huge gap between the Soviet fronts and exploited the weakness of the Soviet \"Mozyr Group\" that was supposed to protect the weak link between the Soviet fronts. The Poles continued their northward offensive with two armies following and destroying the surprised enemy. They reached the rear of Tukhachevsky's forces, the majority of which were encircled by 18 August. Only that same day did Tukhachevsky, at his [[Minsk]] headquarters 480 kilometres (300 mi) east of Warsaw, become fully aware of the proportions of the Soviet defeat and ordered the remnants of his forces to retreat and regroup. He hoped to straighten his front line, halt the Polish attack, and regain the initiative, but the orders either arrived too late or failed to arrive at all.<ref name=\"Lawrynowicz\"/>\n\nSoviet armies in the centre of the front fell into chaos. Tukhachevsky ordered a general retreat toward the [[Bug River]], but by then he had lost contact with most of his forces near Warsaw, and all the Bolshevik plans had been thrown into disarray by communication failures.<ref name=\"Lawrynowicz\"/>\n\nBolshevik armies retreated in a disorganised fashion; entire divisions panicking and disintegrating. The Red Army's defeat was so great and unexpected that, at the instigation of Pi\u0142sudski's detractors, the [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|Battle of Warsaw]] is often referred to in Poland as the \"[[Miracle at the Vistula]]\".

We could and should take advantage of the military situation to begin an offensive war... we should poke about with bayonets to see whether the socialist revolution of the proletariat had not ripened in Poland... that somewhere near Warsaw lies not [only] the center of the Polish bourgeois government and the republic of capital, but the center of the whole contemporary system of international imperialism, and that circumstances enabled us to shake that system, and to conduct politics not in Poland but in Germany and England. In this manner, in Germany and England we created a completely new zone of proletarian revolution against global imperialism...

Russia sought to cross Poland in order to stimulate a Europe-wide communist revolution.\n\nPoland's [[Chief of State]], [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]], felt the time was right to expand Polish borders as far east as feasible, to be followed by a Polish-led [[Intermarium]] federation of [[Central and Eastern Europe]]an states, as a bulwark against the re-emergence of German and Russian [[imperialism]]. [[Vladimir Lenin]] saw Poland as the bridge the [[Red Army]] had to cross to assist [[Communism|other Communist movements]] and bring about more European revolutions. By 1919, Polish forces had taken control of much of [[Western Ukraine]], emerging victorious from the [[Polish\u2013Ukrainian War]]. The [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]], led by [[Yevhen Petrushevych]], had tried to create a Ukrainian state on territories to which both Poles and Ukrainians laid claim. In the Russian part of Ukraine [[Symon Petliura]] tried to defend and strengthen the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] but as the [[Bolsheviks]] began to win the [[Russian Civil War]], they started to advance westward towards the disputed Ukrainian territories, causing Petliura's forces to retreat to [[Podolia]]. By the end of 1919, a clear front had formed as Petliura decided to ally with Pi\u0142sudski. Border skirmishes escalated following Pi\u0142sudski's [[Kiev Offensive (1920)|Kiev Offensive]] in April 1920.\n\nThe Polish offensive was met by a successful Red Army [[counter-attack]]. The Soviet operation pushed the Polish forces back westward all the way to the Polish capital, [[Warsaw]], while the [[Directorate of Ukraine]] fled to Western Europe. Western fears of Soviet troops arriving at the German frontiers [[Interallied Mission to Poland|increased the interest of Western powers]] in the war. In mid-summer, the fall of Warsaw seemed certain but in mid-August, the tide had turned again, as the Polish forces achieved an unexpected and decisive victory at the [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|Battle of Warsaw]]. In the wake of the Polish advance eastward, the Soviets sued for peace and the war ended with a [[cease-fire]] on 18 October 1920.\n\nThe [[Peace of Riga]] was signed on 18 March 1921, dividing the disputed territories between Poland and Soviet Russia. The war largely determined the Soviet\u2013Polish border for the [[Interbellum]]. Poland gained a territory of around 200 kilometers east of its former border, the [[Curzon Line]], which had been defined by an international commission after [[World War I]].<ref>{{citation|surname1=Norman Davies|title=Heart of Europe.

In some Polish sources it is also referred as the \"War of 1920\" (Polish: ''Wojna 1920 roku'').<ref group=\"N\">For example: 1) {{Harvnb|Cisek|1990}} ''S\u0105siedzi wobec '''wojny 1920 roku'''.

The ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' begins its article with the date range 1919\u20131920 but then states, \"Although there had been hostilities between the two countries during 1919, the conflict began when the Polish head of state J\u00f3zef Pilsudski formed an alliance with the Ukrainian nationalist leader Symon Petlyura (21 April 1920) and their combined forces began to overrun Ukraine, occupying Kiev on 7 May.\"<ref group=\"N\" name=\"brit_ruspol\"/> The Polish encyclopaedia [[Internetowa encyklopedia PWN]],<ref name=\"pwn_polbol\"/> as well as Western historians such as [[Norman Davies]], consider 1919 the starting year of the war.<ref name=\"davies_WERS_22\"/>\n\nThe ending date is given as either 1920 or 1921; this confusion stems from the fact that while the [[cease-fire]] was put into force on 18 October 1920, the [[Treaty of Riga|official treaty ending the war]] was signed months later, on 18 March 1921. While the events of 1919 can be described as a border conflict, and only in early 1920 did both sides engage in all-out war, the conflicts that took place in 1920 were an inevitable escalation of fighting that began in earnest a year earlier. In the end, the events of 1920 were a logical, though unforeseen, consequence of the 1919 prelude.<ref name=\"davies_WERS_22\"/>\n\n== Prelude ==\n{{Main|Causes of the Polish\u2013Soviet War}}\n[[File:Rzeczpospolita Rozbiory 3.png|thumb|[[Partitions of Poland]] in 1795: The coloured territories show the extent of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] just before the first partition. In blue (north-west), land absorbed by the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], green (south) by Austria, and red (east) by the [[Russian Empire]].]]\n\nThe war's main territories of contention lie in present-day Ukraine and Belarus; until the middle of the 13th century they formed part of the medieval state of [[Kievan Rus']]. After a period of internecine wars and the Mongolian invasion of 1240, these lands became objects of expansion for the Kingdom of Poland and for the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. In the first half of the 14th century, the [[Kievan Rus'|Grand Duchy of Kiev]] and land between the [[Dnieper]], [[Pripyat River|Pripyat]], and [[Daugava (river)|Daugava (Western Dvina)]] rivers became part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and in 1352 Poland and Lithuania divided the [[Kingdom of Galicia\u2013Volhynia]] between themselves.

This approach to holding ground harked back to the World War I practice of \"establishing a fortified line of defense\". It had shown some merit on the Western Front saturated with troops, machine guns, and artillery. Poland's eastern front, however, was weakly manned, supported with inadequate artillery, and had almost no fortifications.<ref name=\"Lawrynowicz\" />\n\n[[File:PBW August 1920.png|thumb|250px|Soviet offensive successes, early August 1920]]\nAgainst the Polish line the Red Army gathered its Northwest Front led by the young General [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]].

The 4th, 15th, and 3rd Armies were to push west, supported from the south by the [[Western Army (Russia)|16th Army]] and Mozyr Group. For three days the outcome of the battle hung in the balance, but Soviet numerical superiority proved decisive and by 7 July Polish forces were in full retreat along the entire front. However, due to the stubborn defence by Polish units, Tukhachevsky's plan to break through the front and push the defenders south-west into the [[Pinsk Marshes]] failed.<ref name=\"Lawrynowicz\" />\n[[File:Cooper Fauntleroy.jpg|thumb|left|American volunteer pilots, [[Merian C.

However, the Polish troops were insufficient in number. Soviet forces found a weakly defended part of the front and broke through. Gaj-Chan and Lithuanian forces captured Vilnius on 14 July, forcing the Poles into retreat again. In [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] to the south, General [[Semyon Budyonny]]'s cavalry advanced far into the Polish rear, capturing [[Brody]] and approaching [[Lviv|Lw\u00f3w]] and [[Zamo\u015b\u0107]].

Grodno in Belarus fell on 19 July; Brest-Litovsk fell on 1 August.

The city was soon [[Battle of Lw\u00f3w (1920)|besieged]]. This created a hole in the lines of the Red Army, but at the same time opened the way to the Polish capital.

At Tukhachevsky's insistence the Soviet High Command had ordered the 1st Cavalry Army to march north toward Warsaw and [[Lublin]].

It faced the combined forces of the numerically and materially superior Soviet 3rd and 15th Armies. In one day the Soviet advance toward Warsaw and [[Modlin (Nowy Dw\u00f3r Mazowiecki)|Modlin]] had been halted and soon turned into retreat. Sikorski's 5th Army pushed the exhausted Soviet formations away from Warsaw in a lightning operation. Polish forces advanced at a speed of thirty kilometers a day, soon destroying any Soviet hopes for completing their enveloping manoeuvre in the north. By 16 August, the Polish [[Battle of D\u0119blin and Mi\u0144sk Mazowiecki|counter-offensive]] had been fully joined by Marshal Pi\u0142sudski's \"Reserve Army.\" Precisely executing his plan, the Polish force, [[Battle of D\u0119blin and Mi\u0144sk Mazowiecki|advancing]] from Warsaw (Colonel Wrzali\u0144ski's group) and the south (Polish 3rd and 4 Army), found a huge gap between the Soviet fronts and exploited the weakness of the Soviet \"Mozyr Group\" that was supposed to protect the weak link between the Soviet fronts. The Poles continued their northward offensive with two armies following and destroying the surprised enemy. They reached the rear of Tukhachevsky's forces, the majority of which were encircled by 18 August. Only that same day did Tukhachevsky, at his [[Minsk]] headquarters 480 kilometres (300 mi) east of Warsaw, become fully aware of the proportions of the Soviet defeat and ordered the remnants of his forces to retreat and regroup. He hoped to straighten his front line, halt the Polish attack, and regain the initiative, but the orders either arrived too late or failed to arrive at all.<ref name=\"Lawrynowicz\"/>\n\nSoviet armies in the centre of the front fell into chaos. Tukhachevsky ordered a general retreat toward the [[Bug River]], but by then he had lost contact with most of his forces near Warsaw, and all the Bolshevik plans had been thrown into disarray by communication failures.<ref name=\"Lawrynowicz\"/>\n\nBolshevik armies retreated in a disorganised fashion; entire divisions panicking and disintegrating. The Red Army's defeat was so great and unexpected that, at the instigation of Pi\u0142sudski's detractors, the [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|Battle of Warsaw]] is often referred to in Poland as the \"[[Miracle at the Vistula]]\".

We could and should take advantage of the military situation to begin an offensive war... we should poke about with bayonets to see whether the socialist revolution of the proletariat had not ripened in Poland... that somewhere near Warsaw lies not [only] the center of the Polish bourgeois government and the republic of capital, but the center of the whole contemporary system of international imperialism, and that circumstances enabled us to shake that system, and to conduct politics not in Poland but in Germany and England. In this manner, in Germany and England we created a completely new zone of proletarian revolution against global imperialism...

It was developed as a co-production between [[BBC Worldwide]], [[Universal Studios]], [[20th Century Fox]], and the American network [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. It premiered on 12 May 1996 on [[CITV-TV|CITV]] in [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]], [[Alberta]], Canada (which was owned by [[Western International Communications|WIC]] at the time before being acquired by [[Canwest Global]] in 2000), 15 days before its first showing in the United Kingdom on [[BBC One]] and two days before being broadcast in the United States on Fox. It was also shown in some countries for a limited time in cinemas.\n\nThe film was the first attempt to revive ''Doctor Who'' following its suspension in 1989. It was intended as a [[backdoor pilot]] for a new American-produced ''Doctor Who'' TV series.  It introduced [[Paul McGann]] as the [[Eighth Doctor]] in his only televised appearance as the character until \"[[The Night of the Doctor]]\" in 2013 (though McGann has portrayed the Doctor also in various audio productions).  It also marks the final appearance of [[Sylvester McCoy]] as the [[Seventh Doctor]], the only appearance of [[Daphne Ashbrook]] as [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] [[Grace Holloway]], and the only appearance of [[Eric Roberts]]'s version of [[The Master (Doctor Who)|The Master]].  Although a ratings success in the United Kingdom, the film did not fare well on American television and no series was commissioned. The series was later relaunched on the BBC in 2005.<ref name=\"Segal\" /> The only ''Doctor Who'' episodes between the film and the new series were a 1999 spoof, ''[[Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death]]'', and a 2003 animation, ''[[Scream of the Shalka]]''.\n\nAlthough the film was primarily produced by different people than the 1963\u20131989 series and intended for an American audience, the producers chose not to produce a \"re-imagining\" or \"[[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]]\" of the series but rather a continuation of the original narrative. The production was filmed in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], to date the only episode of ''Doctor Who'' filmed in Canada.\n\n==Plot==\n{{needsattention|project=Doctor Who|type=plot|date=June 2017|\n {{Long plot|episode|date=June 2017}}\n}}\nFollowing [[The Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]]'s trial and execution at the hands of the [[Dalek]]s, [[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]], currently in his [[Seventh Doctor|seventh incarnation]], is transporting the Master's remains to [[Gallifrey]] via his [[TARDIS]]. En route, the box with the remains breaks open and an ooze leaks out, infecting the TARDIS. The Doctor is forced to make an emergency materialisation in San Francisco's [[Chinatown]] on 30 December 1999.\n\nAs he exits and locks the TARDIS, the Doctor is shot by a gang chasing down Chang Lee, a young [[Chinese-American]] man. Lee calls for an ambulance and escorts the unconscious Doctor to a hospital, unaware the ooze from the TARDIS has gotten aboard the ambulance. At the hospital, after the bullets are removed, [[cardiology|cardiologist]] Dr [[Grace Holloway]] attempts surgery to stabilise his unusual heartbeat, but is confused by his strange double-heart anatomy, and accidentally lodges a cardiac probe in the Doctor's body, apparently killing him. The Doctor's body is taken to the morgue, while Lee steals the Doctor's possessions, including the TARDIS key. Meanwhile, the ooze takes over the body of the ambulance driver, Bruce, transforming him into a new body for the Master.\n\nLater, the Doctor's body [[Doctor (Doctor Who)#Changing faces|regenerates]], and the [[Eighth Doctor|new Doctor]], suffering amnesia, gathers clothes from an upcoming fancy dress party. He recognises Holloway, who has resigned from the hospital after the failed operation, and follows her to her car, proving to her he is the same man by pulling out the cardiac probe. Holloway takes him home to recover. Lee returns to the TARDIS where the Master arrives and puts him under his mind control by claiming the Doctor had stolen his body. The Master convinces Lee to open the TARDIS and then to open the [[Eye of Harmony]] within it, which requires a human retinal scan. When the Eye opens, the Doctor is flooded with memories and realises the Master is searching for him, and tries to block the scan. He warns Holloway that while the Eye is opened, the fabric of reality will weaken, and potentially destroy the Earth by midnight on New Year's Eve if they cannot close it. However, he needs an [[atomic clock]] to do so, and Holloway finds one on display at  the San Francisco Institute of Technological Advancement and Research.\n\nOutside, they find the ambulance with the Master and Lee waiting for them, offering them a ride. The Doctor does not immediately recognise the Master, but discovers his true identity en route, and he and Holloway escape, but not before the Master can spit an ooze-like substance on Holloway's wrist. The two continue to the Institute and obtain the clock, returning to the TARDIS. The Doctor installs the clock and successfully closes the Eye, but finds the damage to reality too great and that he must revert time before the Eye was opened to prevent the destruction of Earth. As he connects the proper TARDIS circuits to do this, the Master remotely takes control of Holloway's body, causing her eyes to become inhuman, and she strikes the Doctor unconscious.\n\n[[File:Doctor Who1996.jpg|275px|thumbnail|The Doctor and the Master in their climactic battle]]\nThe Doctor wakes to find himself chained above the Eye, the Master poised to take his remaining regenerations while Lee and Holloway watch. The Doctor is able to break the Master's control on Lee, and Lee refuses to open the Eye for the Master. The Master kills him, and then releases his control on Holloway to return her eyes to normal. He forces her to open the Eye and then begins drawing the Doctor's lifeforce. Holloway, under her own control, is able to complete the final circuits to put the TARDIS into a time-holding pattern, preventing Earth's destruction, and then goes to free the Doctor. The Master kills her, but this has given enough time for the Doctor to free himself and attack the Master. The Doctor gains the upper hand and pushes the Master into the Eye. The Eye closes and time reverts a few minutes, undoing Lee and Holloway's deaths.\n\nWith no further risk to Earth, the Doctor prepares to leave. Lee returns his possessions, and the Doctor warns him not to be in San Francisco on the next New Year's Eve. The Doctor offers Holloway the opportunity to travel with him, but she politely refuses, and instead kisses him goodbye. The Doctor departs alone in his TARDIS.\n\n===Continuity===\n\n*At the beginning of the film, the Seventh Doctor uses a brand new version of the [[Sonic Screwdriver]] to seal the Master's remains in a casket. The device was previously destroyed in [[The Visitation (Doctor Who)| \"The Visitation\"]]. The jelly babies, which the [[Fourth Doctor]] had a fondness for, also reappear during the opening scene and then later during the story.\n\n*The [[Seventh Doctor]] wears his trademark panama hat which he wore throughout his tenure in the Classic Series.\n\n*The [[Eighth Doctor]] mentions that he once met [[Leonardo Di Vinci]] when the artist had a cold and had met[[Puccini]] during the last years of the composer's life.\n\n*The Eye of Harmony in the TARDIS' Cloister Room was previously on the Doctor's home planet [[Gallifrey]].\n\n*The [[Eighth Doctor]] shows Grace and Chang Lee Gallifrey on the TARDIS' time visualiser, remarking that the planet \"a good ten minutes in this old thing.\"\n\n*The Doctor's romantic nature in this story would later be taken on board with the [[Ninth Doctor|Ninth]] and [[Tenth Doctor||Tenth]] Doctors when the series returned in 2005.\n\n===Cast notes===\n* Yee Jee Tso would later return in 2002 to play Major Jal Brant in the [[Seventh Doctor]] audio drama ''[[Excelis Decays]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bigfinish.com/3-Doctor-Who-Excelis-Decays|title=Doctor Who \u2013 Excelis Decays|publisher=[[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]]}}</ref> and Doctor Reece Goddard in the [[Sixth Doctor]] webcast ''[[Real Time (Doctor Who)|Real Time]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bigfinish.com/Doctor-Who-Real-Time|title=Doctor Who \u2013 Real Time|publisher=[[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]]}}</ref>\n*Daphne Ashbrook would later return in 2004 alongside [[Paul McGann]]'s [[Eighth Doctor]] as Perfection in the audio drama ''[[The Next Life (audio drama)|The Next Life]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bigfinish.com/64-Doctor-Who-The-Next-Life|title=Doctor Who \u2013 The Next Life|publisher=[[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]]}}</ref>\n* Tso and Ashbrook returned to Big Finish together playing Captain Ruth Matheson and Warrant Officer Charlie Sato of UNIT in the audio dramas ''Tales From The Vault''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bigfinish.com/releases/v/tales-from-the-vault-501 |title=6.01.

It was hoped that, would the telemovie be successful, Fox might be persuaded to reconsider a series; however, the telemovie's ratings performance in America was not strong enough to hold Fox's interest.\n\nThe production budget for the movie (as revealed in the book ''Doctor Who: Regeneration'') was US$5 million, with the [[Fox Network]] spending $2.5 million, [[BBC Television]] contributing $300,000, and the remaining $2.2 million split between [[BBC Worldwide]] and [[Universal Television]].\n\n===Casting===\nThe producers of the television movie compiled several lists of actors to consider for the part of the Doctor.

Eccleston turned down the offer to audition for the TV Movie because at the time he felt he was not yet an established enough actor and did not want to be associated with a \"brand name\" so early in his career.<ref name=\"eccleston\"/> Capaldi declined because he felt it was unlikely that he would be given the part.<ref name=\"capaldi\"/>\n\nOf those actors who originally auditioned for the role of the Doctor, a number would go on to guest star in the series when it returned from 2005:\n*Anthony Head guest starred in the Series 2 episode \"[[School Reunion]]\" as Mr. Finch.\n*Tim McInnerny guest-starred in the Series 4 episode \"[[Planet of the Ood]]\" as Klineman Halpen.\n*Liam Cunningham guest-starred in the Series 7 episode, \"[[Cold War (Doctor Who)|Cold War]]\" as Captain Zhukov. \n*John Sessions guest-starred in the Series 8 episode \"[[Mummy on the Orient Express]]\" as the voice of the homicidal computer GUS.\n\n===Production===\nThe movie was filmed on 35mm film in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], the first time any ''Doctor Who'' story had been filmed in North America.\n\nIn the 2005 ''[[Doctor Who Confidential]]'' episode \"Weird Science\", and on the DVD commentary, Sylvester McCoy reveals that during the sequence where he locks the casket with his [[sonic screwdriver]], he held the tool pointing the wrong way around (although in the original series, it is seen being used both ways). The sonic screwdriver was blurred in post-production to conceal the error.\n\n===Post-production===\nThe opening pre-credits sequence went through a number of modifications, with several different voice-overs recorded. At one stage the voice-over was to be made by the old Master, played by Gordon Tipple; in the end this was not used. Tipple is still credited as \"The Old Master\", though in the final edit his appearance is very brief, stationary, and mute. Had the original pre-titles voice-over been used, it would have been unclear what incarnation of the Doctor Sylvester McCoy portrays in the movie (as he is simply credited as \"The Old Doctor\"). Only the rewritten narration (as read by Paul McGann) makes his number of regenerations clear. The sequence of the TARDIS flying through the time vortex was briefly reused in the opening of ''[[Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death]]'', as the Master observes [[Rowan Atkinson]]'s Doctor.\n\nInstead of designing a new ''Doctor Who'' logo for this film, it was decided instead to use a modified version of the logo that was used for the [[Jon Pertwee]] era of the original series (with the exception of the final season). This logo, being the last logo used on an \"official\" Doctor Who broadcast before the 2005 revival, was, until 2018, used by the BBC for most ''Doctor Who'' merchandise relating to the first eight Doctors. In 2018, efforts were made to make the show's merchandise more uniform, and so most items of merchandise began to use the logo designed for Jodie Whittaker's time as the Doctor, abandoning the \"Movie\" logo for the first time in 22 years.\n\n[[John Debney]] was commissioned to write the score for this film, and intended to replace [[Ron Grainer]]'s original theme with a new composition. Ultimately Debney did in fact use an arrangement of Grainer's music for the theme, although Grainer goes uncredited.\n\n=== Alternative titles and labelling ===\nThere is some disagreement over exactly what the movie should be called. The production documentation only referred to the project as ''Doctor Who''{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}. Segal suggested the unofficial title ''Enemy Within'' as an alternative at Manopticon 5, apparently after being repeatedly asked what the actual title for the movie was{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}. Both [[DVD]] releases are labelled ''Doctor Who: The Movie''. The [[VHS]] release contains both the name ''Doctor Who'' and the phrase, ''The Sensational Feature Length Film'' (plausibly read as a subtitle). The most common fan usage appears to refer to it as \"The Television Movie\" or \"TVM\", or variations thereof.\n\nUpon translation into French, this film was renamed ''Le Seigneur du Temps'' (literal translation: \"The Lord of Time\").\n\n\"TVM\" is the production code used in the BBC's online episode guide.<ref name=\"movie\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/tvmovie/detail.shtml\n| title = The TV Movie: Details\n| accessdate = 2007-07-26\n| last = Howe\n| first = David J.\n| authorlink = David J.

This marked the first time that footage from the original BBC series had been shown on a major American network. The advertisements also used a different arrangement of the Doctor Who theme music from that heard in the film.\n\nThe movie received disappointing US ratings. It received 5.6 million viewers, a total 9% share of the audience.<ref name=\"DWM 433 page 53\">{{cite journal| author= Bailey, David|date=April 2011 |title=Doctor Who| journal=[[Doctor Who Magazine]]| publisher=[[Panini Comics]]| issue=#433| page=53}}</ref> However, when shown on [[BBC One]] in the United Kingdom on Monday 27 May at 8.30pm, thirteen days after its American broadcast, it received over 9 million viewers in the UK alone. It received a 75% [[Audience Appreciation]] score.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n[[Third Doctor]] actor [[Jon Pertwee]] died a few days after the US broadcast of the film, and the UK broadcast included an epitaph to the actor. The UK broadcast was also edited for broadcast in a pre-[[Watershed (television)|Watershed]] timeslot, with around 1 minute of cuts made. The scenes where Chang Lee's friends are fired upon was cut because of the BBC's sensitivity about [[gun violence]] following the [[Dunblane massacre]] three months before.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} The operating room scene was also extensively cut, in particular shots involving the cardiac probe and the Seventh Doctor's dying scream,{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} and the shot of the Master breaking Chang Lee's neck was also removed.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nMaureen Paton in the ''[[Daily Express]]'' praised the movie \"At last we have a grown-up hi-tech Doctor Who in Paul McGann...only a low-tech Luddite would miss the endearing amateurism of the old teatime serial format...the makers would be mad not to pursue the option of a series.\"<ref name=\"th\">{{cite book |first1=David J. |last1=Howe |authorlink1=David J.

It was the first novelisation of a televised ''Doctor Who'' story to not be published by [[Target Books]] (or related companies) since ''[[The Crusade (Doctor Who)|Doctor Who and the Crusaders]]'' in 1966.\n\nBasing the adaptation on an early draft of the script, Russell adjusted some details to make it more consistent with the original series, and the novelisation also contains elements that were cut from the shooting script for timing reasons.\n* The novel begins with the Seventh Doctor receiving a telepathic summons from the Master (similar to ''[[The Deadly Assassin]]'') to collect his remains from Skaro and a short prologue detailing how the Doctor escapes from the planet with the casket. This was originally intended to be a pre-credits sequence in the movie, and was subsequently contradicted by the ending of the novel ''[[Lungbarrow]]'', where [[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]] gives the Seventh Doctor the assignment to retrieve the Master's remains.\n* More detail is given to Chang Lee and Grace's backstory, including his recruitment into the Triads and his seeking a father figure as well as flashbacks to Grace's childhood.\n* The Eighth Doctor finds the Seventh Doctor's clothing in the hospital rather than the Fourth Doctor's scarf. Also, the sequence where Chang Lee and the Master see the Seventh Doctor in the Eye of Harmony features all the previous Doctors as originally drafted.\n* The scene where the Doctor and Grace meet the motorcycle police officer is relocated to a traffic jam on the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] (impossible to film in the movie since it was shot on location in [[Vancouver]]).\n* When the Doctor first kisses Grace, he immediately pulls back, grins apologetically and murmurs, \"I'm sorry, don't know what came over me there.\" This makes the romantic nature of the kiss more ambiguous. Instead of the second kiss at the end, he gives her the Seventh Doctor's straw hat as a memento.\n* The Doctor is still referred to as half-human, to which the Master comments, \"The Doctor once claimed to be more than just a Time Lord \u2014 He should really have said ''less'' than a Time Lord!\" This was a reference to a line cut from ''[[Remembrance of the Daleks]]''.\n* Instead of dying and being brought back to life, Grace and Lee are merely rendered unconscious, though aware of what is happening around them. Russell also spends some time showing the Doctor and them discussing what a \"temporal orbit\" is.\n\nThe novelisation was the first ''Doctor Who'' novel published by BBC Books. The book was actually published prior to the conclusion of [[Virgin Books]]' contract for publishing original ''Doctor Who'' fiction, so the next release by BBC Books did not occur for about a year when the [[Eighth Doctor Adventures]] series began with ''[[The Eight Doctors]]''. The novelisation was released as a standalone work and is not considered part of this series. The Eighth Doctor Adventures series ran until 2005 when it was discontinued.\n\nThe novel was also released as an [[Doctor Who audio releases|audio book]] on 2 June 1997, read by Paul McGann. This reading was later included on the 2004 [[MP3 CD]] ''Tales from the TARDIS Volume Two''. A [[Target Books]] edition titled ''The TV Movie'' will be published in paperback 11 March 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/1073116/doctor-who--the-tv-movie--target-collection-/9781785945311.html|title=Doctor Who: The TV Movie (Target Collection)|first=Gary|last=Russell|website=www.penguin.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|1990s}}\n{{Wikiquote|The Eighth Doctor}}\n{{TardisIndexFile|Doctor Who (1996)}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0116118|title=Doctor Who (1996) (TV)}}\n* {{BBCCDW|id=tvmovie|title=The TV movie}}\n\n===Reviews===\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110414090315/http://www.whoniverse.org/reviews/TVM.php The Whoniverse's review on ''Doctor Who: The Enemy Within'' DVD]\n\n===BBC novelisation===\n*{{Isfdb title|id=364011|title=Doctor Who}}\n\n{{Doctor Who episodes|-}}\n{{Regeneration stories}}\n{{Master stories}}\n{{Dalek stories}}\n{{Skaro stories}}\n{{Saturn Award for Best Television Presentation}}\n{{Geoffrey Sax}}\n{{Doctor Who soundtracks|state=collapsed}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Doctor Who (1996 Film)}}\n[[Category:1990s science fiction films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films based on Doctor Who]]\n[[Category:Seventh Doctor stories]]\n[[Category:Eighth Doctor stories]]\n[[Category:1996 television films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American television films]]\n[[Category:British science fiction films]]\n[[Category:British films]]\n[[Category:British television films]]\n[[Category:Science fiction television films]]\n[[Category:Television films as pilots]]\n[[Category:Television pilots not picked up as a series]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1999]]\n[[Category:Films set in 2000]]\n[[Category:Films set in San Francisco]]\n[[Category:Films set in the future]]\n[[Category:The Master (Doctor Who) television stories]]\n[[Category:Films based on television series]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Matthew Jacobs]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Geoffrey Sax]]\n[[Category:Doctor Who stories set on Earth]]\n[[Category:Films about amnesia]]\n[[Category:New Year films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by John Debney]]\n[[Category:Television films based on television series]]\n[[Category:Turn of the third millennium]]\n", "text_old": "{{For|the character who appeared in two theatrical ''Dr. Who'' films|Dr. Who (Dalek films)}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2016}}\n{{Use British English|date=June 2016}}\n{{Infobox Doctor Who episode\n| number             = 156\n| serial_name        = Doctor Who: The Television Movie\n| show               = DW\n| type               = television film\n| image              = [[File:Doctor Who 1996 poster.jpg|230px]]\n| caption            = 1996 promotional poster\n| doctors            =\n* [[Paul McGann]] ([[Eighth Doctor]])\n*[[Sylvester McCoy]] ([[Seventh Doctor]])\n| companion          = [[Daphne Ashbrook]] ([[Grace Holloway]])\n| guests             = \n*[[Yee Jee Tso]] \u2013 Chang Lee\n*[[Eric Roberts]] \u2013 [[The Master (Doctor Who)|The Master]]\n*[[John Novak]] \u2013 Salinger\n*Michael David Simms \u2013 Dr. Swift\n*Eliza Roberts \u2013 Miranda\n*Dave Hurtubise \u2013 Professor Wagg\n*Dolores Drake \u2013 Curtis\n*Catherine Lough \u2013 Wheeler\n*[[Will Sasso|William Sasso]] \u2013 Pete\n*Joel Wirkkunen \u2013 Ted\n*Jeremy Radick \u2013 Gareth\n*Bill Croft \u2013 Motorcyclist Policeman\n*[[Mi-Jung Lee]] \u2013 News Anchor\n*Joanna Piros \u2013 News Anchor\n*Dee Jay Jackson \u2013 Security Man\n*Gordon Tipple \u2013 The Master on Trial\n| director           = [[Geoffrey Sax]]\n| writer             = [[Matthew Jacobs]]\n| script_editor      = None\n| producer           = Peter V.

It was developed as a co-production between [[BBC Worldwide]], [[Universal Studios]], [[20th Century Fox]], and the American network [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. It premiered on 12 May 1996 on [[CITV-TV|CITV]] in [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]], [[Alberta]], Canada (which was owned by [[Western International Communications|WIC]] at the time before being acquired by [[Canwest Global]] in 2000), 15 days before its first showing in the United Kingdom on [[BBC One]] and two days before being broadcast in the United States on Fox. It was also shown in some countries for a limited time in cinemas.\n\nThe film was the first attempt to revive ''Doctor Who'' following its suspension in 1989. It was intended as a [[backdoor pilot]] for a new American-produced ''Doctor Who'' TV series.  It introduced [[Paul McGann]] as the [[Eighth Doctor]] in his only televised appearance as the character until \"[[The Night of the Doctor]]\" in 2013 (though McGann has portrayed the Doctor also in various audio productions).  It also marks the final appearance of [[Sylvester McCoy]] as the [[Seventh Doctor]], the only appearance of [[Daphne Ashbrook]] as [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] [[Grace Holloway]], and the only appearance of [[Eric Roberts]]'s version of [[The Master (Doctor Who)|The Master]].  Although a ratings success in the United Kingdom, the film did not fare well on American television and no series was commissioned. The series was later relaunched on the BBC in 2005.<ref name=\"Segal\" /> The only ''Doctor Who'' episodes between the film and the new series were a 1999 spoof, ''[[Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death]]'', and a 2003 animation, ''[[Scream of the Shalka]]''.\n\nAlthough the film was primarily produced by different people than the 1963\u20131989 series and intended for an American audience, the producers chose not to produce a \"re-imagining\" or \"[[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]]\" of the series but rather a continuation of the original narrative. The production was filmed in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], to date the only episode of ''Doctor Who'' filmed in Canada.\n\n==Plot==\n{{needsattention|project=Doctor Who|type=plot|date=June 2017|\n {{Long plot|episode|date=June 2017}}\n}}\nFollowing [[The Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]]'s trial and execution at the hands of the [[Dalek]]s, [[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]], currently in his [[Seventh Doctor|seventh incarnation]], is transporting the Master's remains to [[Gallifrey]] via his [[TARDIS]]. En route, the box with the remains breaks open and an ooze leaks out, infecting the TARDIS. The Doctor is forced to make an emergency materialisation in San Francisco's [[Chinatown]] on 30 December 1999.\n\nAs he exits and locks the TARDIS, the Doctor is shot by a gang chasing down Chang Lee, a young [[Chinese-American]] man. Lee calls for an ambulance and escorts the unconscious Doctor to a hospital, unaware the ooze from the TARDIS has gotten aboard the ambulance. At the hospital, after the bullets are removed, [[cardiology|cardiologist]] Dr [[Grace Holloway]] attempts surgery to stabilise his unusual heartbeat, but is confused by his strange double-heart anatomy, and accidentally lodges a cardiac probe in the Doctor's body, apparently killing him. The Doctor's body is taken to the morgue, while Lee steals the Doctor's possessions, including the TARDIS key. Meanwhile, the ooze takes over the body of the ambulance driver, Bruce, transforming him into a new body for the Master.\n\nLater, the Doctor's body [[Doctor (Doctor Who)#Changing faces|regenerates]], and the [[Eighth Doctor|new Doctor]], suffering amnesia, gathers clothes from an upcoming fancy dress party. He recognises Holloway, who has resigned from the hospital after the failed operation, and follows her to her car, proving to her he is the same man by pulling out the cardiac probe. Holloway takes him home to recover. Lee returns to the TARDIS where the Master arrives and puts him under his mind control by claiming the Doctor had stolen his body. The Master convinces Lee to open the TARDIS and then to open the [[Eye of Harmony]] within it, which requires a human retinal scan. When the Eye opens, the Doctor is flooded with memories and realises the Master is searching for him, and tries to block the scan. He warns Holloway that while the Eye is opened, the fabric of reality will weaken, and potentially destroy the Earth by midnight on New Year's Eve if they cannot close it. However, he needs an [[atomic clock]] to do so, and Holloway finds one on display at  the San Francisco Institute of Technological Advancement and Research.\n\nOutside, they find the ambulance with the Master and Lee waiting for them, offering them a ride. The Doctor does not immediately recognise the Master, but discovers his true identity en route, and he and Holloway escape, but not before the Master can spit an ooze-like substance on Holloway's wrist. The two continue to the Institute and obtain the clock, returning to the TARDIS. The Doctor installs the clock and successfully closes the Eye, but finds the damage to reality too great and that he must revert time before the Eye was opened to prevent the destruction of Earth. As he connects the proper TARDIS circuits to do this, the Master remotely takes control of Holloway's body, causing her eyes to become inhuman, and she strikes the Doctor unconscious.\n\n[[File:Doctor Who1996.jpg|275px|thumbnail|The Doctor and the Master in their climactic battle]]\nThe Doctor wakes to find himself chained above the Eye, the Master poised to take his remaining regenerations while Lee and Holloway watch. The Doctor is able to break the Master's control on Lee, and Lee refuses to open the Eye for the Master. The Master kills him, and then releases his control on Holloway to return her eyes to normal. He forces her to open the Eye and then begins drawing the Doctor's lifeforce. Holloway, under her own control, is able to complete the final circuits to put the TARDIS into a time-holding pattern, preventing Earth's destruction, and then goes to free the Doctor. The Master kills her, but this has given enough time for the Doctor to free himself and attack the Master. The Doctor gains the upper hand and pushes the Master into the Eye. The Eye closes and time reverts a few minutes, undoing Lee and Holloway's deaths.\n\nWith no further risk to Earth, the Doctor prepares to leave. Lee returns his possessions, and the Doctor warns him not to be in San Francisco on the next New Year's Eve. The Doctor offers Holloway the opportunity to travel with him, but she politely refuses, and instead kisses him goodbye.

It was hoped that, would the telemovie be successful, Fox might be persuaded to reconsider a series; however, the telemovie's ratings performance in America was not strong enough to hold Fox's interest.\n\nThe production budget for the movie (as revealed in the book ''Doctor Who: Regeneration'') was US$5 million, with the [[Fox Network]] spending $2.5 million, [[BBC Television]] contributing $300,000, and the remaining $2.2 million split between [[BBC Worldwide]] and [[Universal Television]].\n\n===Casting===\nThe producers of the television movie compiled several lists of actors to consider for the part of the Doctor. Among early thoughts were [[Michael Crawford]], [[Tim Curry]], [[Eric Idle]], [[Billy Connolly]], [[Trevor Eve]], [[Michael Palin]], [[Robert Lindsay (actor)|Robert Lindsay]], and [[Jonathan Pryce]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} All were uninterested in the project, or unavailable for the intended filming dates.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nCasting sessions took place in March 1994; actors who actually auditioned for the role include [[Liam Cunningham (actor)|Liam Cunningham]], [[Mark McGann]], [[Robert Lindsay (actor)|Robert Lindsay]], [[Tim McInnerny]], [[Nathaniel Parker]], [[Peter Woodward]], [[John Sessions]], [[Anthony Head]], and [[Tony Slattery]]. Paul McGann was first considered around the time of these auditions, but did not formally audition for the part until later.<ref name=\"Segal\">{{cite book |last1=Segal |first1=Philip |authorlink1=Philip Segal |first2=Gary |last2=Russell |authorlink2=Gary Russell |title=Doctor Who:Regeneration |year=2000 |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |location=London |isbn=0-00-710591-6}}</ref>\n\nAmong the actors who were invited to audition for the role of the Doctor but declined the opportunity were [[Christopher Eccleston]]<ref name=\"eccleston\">{{cite journal |author=Hickman, Clayton |authorlink=Clayton Hickman |title=Revolution #9 |page=11 |journal=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] |issue=343| location=[[Tunbridge Wells]] |publisher=[[Panini UK]] |date=26 May 2004 }}</ref> and [[Peter Capaldi]].<ref name=\"capaldi\">{{cite web |url=http://www.kasterborous.com/2014/08/capaldi-couldve-eighth-doctor/ |title=Capaldi could\u2019ve been the Eighth Doctor! |last1=Bates |first1=Philip |date=1 August 2014 |website=Kasterborous.com |accessdate=24 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808053048/http://www.kasterborous.com/2014/08/capaldi-couldve-eighth-doctor/ |archivedate=8 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Eccleston and Capaldi would go on to play the [[Ninth Doctor|Ninth]] and [[Twelfth Doctor|Twelfth]] incarnations of the Doctor, respectively, in the revived series of ''Doctor Who'' which began in 2005. Eccleston turned down the offer to audition for the TV Movie because at the time he felt he was not yet an established enough actor and did not want to be associated with a \"brand name\" so early in his career.<ref name=\"eccleston\"/> Capaldi declined because he felt it was unlikely that he would be given the part.<ref name=\"capaldi\"/>\n\nOf those actors who originally auditioned for the role of the Doctor, a number would go on to guest star in the series when it returned from 2005:\n*Anthony Head guest starred in the Series 2 episode \"[[School Reunion]]\" as Mr. Finch.\n*Tim McInnerny guest-starred in the Series 4 episode \"[[Planet of the Ood]]\" as Klineman Halpen.\n*Liam Cunningham guest-starred in the Series 7 episode, \"[[Cold War (Doctor Who)|Cold War]]\" as Captain Zhukov. \n*John Sessions guest-starred in the Series 8 episode \"[[Mummy on the Orient Express]]\" as the voice of the homicidal computer GUS.\n\n===Production===\nThe movie was filmed on 35mm film in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], the first time any ''Doctor Who'' story had been filmed in North America.\n\nIn the 2005 ''[[Doctor Who Confidential]]'' episode \"Weird Science\", and on the DVD commentary, Sylvester McCoy reveals that during the sequence where he locks the casket with his [[sonic screwdriver]], he held the tool pointing the wrong way around (although in the original series, it is seen being used both ways). The sonic screwdriver was blurred in post-production to conceal the error.\n\n===Post-production===\nThe opening pre-credits sequence went through a number of modifications, with several different voice-overs recorded. At one stage the voice-over was to be made by the old Master, played by Gordon Tipple; in the end this was not used. Tipple is still credited as \"The Old Master\", though in the final edit his appearance is very brief, stationary, and mute. Had the original pre-titles voice-over been used, it would have been unclear what incarnation of the Doctor Sylvester McCoy portrays in the movie (as he is simply credited as \"The Old Doctor\"). Only the rewritten narration (as read by Paul McGann) makes his number of regenerations clear. The sequence of the TARDIS flying through the time vortex was briefly reused in the opening of ''[[Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death]]'', as the Master observes [[Rowan Atkinson]]'s Doctor.\n\nInstead of designing a new ''Doctor Who'' logo for this film, it was decided instead to use a modified version of the logo that was used for the [[Jon Pertwee]] era of the original series (with the exception of the final season). This logo, being the last logo used on an \"official\" Doctor Who broadcast before the 2005 revival, was, until 2018, used by the BBC for most ''Doctor Who'' merchandise relating to the first eight Doctors. In 2018, efforts were made to make the show's merchandise more uniform, and so most items of merchandise began to use the logo designed for Jodie Whittaker's time as the Doctor, abandoning the \"Movie\" logo for the first time in 22 years.\n\n[[John Debney]] was commissioned to write the score for this film, and intended to replace [[Ron Grainer]]'s original theme with a new composition. Ultimately Debney did in fact use an arrangement of Grainer's music for the theme, although Grainer goes uncredited.\n\n=== Alternative titles and labelling ===\nThere is some disagreement over exactly what the movie should be called. The production documentation only referred to the project as ''Doctor Who''{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}. Segal suggested the unofficial title ''Enemy Within'' as an alternative at Manopticon 5, apparently after being repeatedly asked what the actual title for the movie was{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}. Both [[DVD]] releases are labelled ''Doctor Who: The Movie''. The [[VHS]] release contains both the name ''Doctor Who'' and the phrase, ''The Sensational Feature Length Film'' (plausibly read as a subtitle). The most common fan usage appears to refer to it as \"The Television Movie\" or \"TVM\", or variations thereof.\n\nUpon translation into French, this film was renamed ''Le Seigneur du Temps'' (literal translation: \"The Lord of Time\").\n\n\"TVM\" is the production code used in the BBC's online episode guide.<ref name=\"movie\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/tvmovie/detail.shtml\n| title = The TV Movie: Details\n| accessdate = 2007-07-26\n| last = Howe\n| first = David J.\n| authorlink = David J.

This marked the first time that footage from the original BBC series had been shown on a major American network. The advertisements also used a different arrangement of the Doctor Who theme music from that heard in the film.\n\nThe movie received disappointing US ratings. It received 5.6 million viewers, a total 9% share of the audience.<ref name=\"DWM 433 page 53\">{{cite journal| author= Bailey, David|date=April 2011 |title=Doctor Who| journal=[[Doctor Who Magazine]]| publisher=[[Panini Comics]]| issue=#433| page=53}}</ref> However, when shown on [[BBC One]] in the United Kingdom on Monday 27 May at 8.30pm, thirteen days after its American broadcast, it received over 9 million viewers in the UK alone. It received a 75% [[Audience Appreciation]] score.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n[[Third Doctor]] actor [[Jon Pertwee]] died a few days after the US broadcast of the film, and the UK broadcast included an epitaph to the actor. The UK broadcast was also edited for broadcast in a pre-[[Watershed (television)|Watershed]] timeslot, with around 1 minute of cuts made. The scenes where Chang Lee's friends are fired upon was cut because of the BBC's sensitivity about [[gun violence]] following the [[Dunblane massacre]] three months before.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} The operating room scene was also extensively cut, in particular shots involving the cardiac probe and the Seventh Doctor's dying scream,{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} and the shot of the Master breaking Chang Lee's neck was also removed.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nMaureen Paton in the ''[[Daily Express]]'' praised the movie \"At last we have a grown-up hi-tech Doctor Who in Paul McGann...only a low-tech Luddite would miss the endearing amateurism of the old teatime serial format...the makers would be mad not to pursue the option of a series.\"<ref name=\"th\">{{cite book |first1=David J. |last1=Howe |authorlink1=David J.

It was the first novelisation of a televised ''Doctor Who'' story to not be published by [[Target Books]] (or related companies) since ''[[The Crusade (Doctor Who)|Doctor Who and the Crusaders]]'' in 1966.\n\nBasing the adaptation on an early draft of the script, Russell adjusted some details to make it more consistent with the original series, and the novelisation also contains elements that were cut from the shooting script for timing reasons.\n* The novel begins with the Seventh Doctor receiving a telepathic summons from the Master (similar to ''[[The Deadly Assassin]]'') to collect his remains from Skaro and a short prologue detailing how the Doctor escapes from the planet with the casket. This was originally intended to be a pre-credits sequence in the movie, and was subsequently contradicted by the ending of the novel ''[[Lungbarrow]]'', where [[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]] gives the Seventh Doctor the assignment to retrieve the Master's remains.\n* More detail is given to Chang Lee and Grace's backstory, including his recruitment into the Triads and his seeking a father figure as well as flashbacks to Grace's childhood.\n* The Eighth Doctor finds the Seventh Doctor's clothing in the hospital rather than the Fourth Doctor's scarf. Also, the sequence where Chang Lee and the Master see the Seventh Doctor in the Eye of Harmony features all the previous Doctors as originally drafted.\n* The scene where the Doctor and Grace meet the motorcycle police officer is relocated to a traffic jam on the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] (impossible to film in the movie since it was shot on location in [[Vancouver]]).\n* When the Doctor first kisses Grace, he immediately pulls back, grins apologetically and murmurs, \"I'm sorry, don't know what came over me there.\" This makes the romantic nature of the kiss more ambiguous. Instead of the second kiss at the end, he gives her the Seventh Doctor's straw hat as a memento.\n* The Doctor is still referred to as half-human, to which the Master comments, \"The Doctor once claimed to be more than just a Time Lord \u2014 He should really have said ''less'' than a Time Lord!\" This was a reference to a line cut from ''[[Remembrance of the Daleks]]''.\n* Instead of dying and being brought back to life, Grace and Lee are merely rendered unconscious, though aware of what is happening around them. Russell also spends some time showing the Doctor and them discussing what a \"temporal orbit\" is.\n\nThe novelisation was the first ''Doctor Who'' novel published by BBC Books. The book was actually published prior to the conclusion of [[Virgin Books]]' contract for publishing original ''Doctor Who'' fiction, so the next release by BBC Books did not occur for about a year when the [[Eighth Doctor Adventures]] series began with ''[[The Eight Doctors]]''. The novelisation was released as a standalone work and is not considered part of this series. The Eighth Doctor Adventures series ran until 2005 when it was discontinued.\n\nThe novel was also released as an [[Doctor Who audio releases|audio book]] on 2 June 1997, read by Paul McGann. This reading was later included on the 2004 [[MP3 CD]] ''Tales from the TARDIS Volume Two''. A [[Target Books]] edition titled ''The TV Movie'' will be published in paperback 11 March 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/1073116/doctor-who--the-tv-movie--target-collection-/9781785945311.html|title=Doctor Who: The TV Movie (Target Collection)|first=Gary|last=Russell|website=www.penguin.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|1990s}}\n{{Wikiquote|The Eighth Doctor}}\n{{TardisIndexFile|Doctor Who (1996)}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0116118|title=Doctor Who (1996) (TV)}}\n* {{BBCCDW|id=tvmovie|title=The TV movie}}\n\n===Reviews===\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110414090315/http://www.whoniverse.org/reviews/TVM.php The Whoniverse's review on ''Doctor Who: The Enemy Within'' DVD]\n\n===BBC novelisation===\n*{{Isfdb title|id=364011|title=Doctor Who}}\n\n{{Doctor Who episodes|-}}\n{{Regeneration stories}}\n{{Master stories}}\n{{Dalek stories}}\n{{Skaro stories}}\n{{Saturn Award for Best Television Presentation}}\n{{Geoffrey Sax}}\n{{Doctor Who soundtracks|state=collapsed}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Doctor Who (1996 Film)}}\n[[Category:1990s science fiction films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films based on Doctor Who]]\n[[Category:Seventh Doctor stories]]\n[[Category:Eighth Doctor stories]]\n[[Category:1996 television films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American television films]]\n[[Category:British science fiction films]]\n[[Category:British films]]\n[[Category:British television films]]\n[[Category:Science fiction television films]]\n[[Category:Television films as pilots]]\n[[Category:Television pilots not picked up as a series]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1999]]\n[[Category:Films set in 2000]]\n[[Category:Films set in San Francisco]]\n[[Category:Films set in the future]]\n[[Category:The Master (Doctor Who) television stories]]\n[[Category:Films based on television series]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Matthew Jacobs]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Geoffrey Sax]]\n[[Category:Doctor Who stories set on Earth]]\n[[Category:Films about amnesia]]\n[[Category:New Year films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by John Debney]]\n[[Category:Television films based on television series]]\n[[Category:Turn of the third millennium]]\n", "name_user": "ArkhamBen17", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePlot", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_(film)"}

The film is a [[live-action]] reimagining or retelling of [[Walt Disney]]'s [[Dumbo|1941 animated film of the same name]], which was based on the novel by Helen Aberson and Harold Pearl. The film stars [[Colin Farrell]], [[Michael Keaton]], [[Danny DeVito]], [[Eva Green]] and [[Alan Arkin]]. The story follows a family that works at a failing [[Circus|traveling circus]] as they encounter a baby elephant with extremely large ears who is capable of flying.\n\nPlans for a live-action film adaptation of ''Dumbo'' were announced in 2014, and Burton was confirmed as director in March 2015. Much of the cast signed on in March 2017 and [[principal photography]] began in July 2017 in England, lasting until November. It was the first of four live-action (or photo-realistically [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated]]) remakes of prior traditionally-animated films that Disney released in 2019, along with ''[[Aladdin (2019 film)|Aladdin]]'', ''[[The Lion King (2019 film)|The Lion King]]'', and ''[[Lady and the Tramp (2019 film)|Lady and the Tramp]]''.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2468374/dumbo-has-screened-see-the-early-reactions|title=Dumbo Has Screened, See The Early Reactions|date=2019-03-14|website=CINEMABLEND|access-date=2019-04-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190321142320/https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2468374/dumbo-has-screened-see-the-early-reactions|archive-date=March 21, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/disney-upcoming-movies-live-action-animation-remakes/|title=All The Live-Action Disney Remakes In Development|last=Fuller|first=Becky|date=March 28, 2019|website=Screen Rant|access-date=April 1, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190401061227/https://screenrant.com/disney-upcoming-movies-live-action-animation-remakes/|archive-date=April 1, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n''Dumbo'' premiered in [[Los Angeles]] on March 11, 2019, and was theatrically released in the United States on March 29, 2019.

The circus has run into financial troubles and Medici had to sell the circus' [[horse]]s after Holt's wife and co-performer, Annie, died from the [[Spanish flu|Spanish flu outbreak]], so Medici reassigns Holt as the caretaker for the circus' pregnant [[Asian elephant]] \"Mrs. Jumbo\". Mrs. Jumbo gives birth to a calf with unusually large ears and Medici orders Holt to hide the ears before allowing the public to see the calf.\n\nHowever, the calf accidentally reveals his ears in his debut performance in [[Joplin, Missouri]], and the crowd laugh and mockingly names the calf \"Dumbo\" while pelting him with peanuts and other objects. Mrs. Jumbo, horrified and enraged by her son's mistreatment, rampages into the ring, causing extensive damage and accidentally collapsing the [[wikt:big top|big top]], which results in the death of abusive handler Rufus. Afterwards, to prevent a public relations problem, Medici resorts to selling Mrs. Jumbo. Holt's son and daughter, Joe and Milly Farrier, comfort Dumbo and discover that he can fly by flapping his ears. The children also discover that feathers are the key to Dumbo's willingness to fly.\n\nIn another performance, Dumbo plays the role of a firefighter clown to put out a fire with water sprayed from his trunk, but the performance goes awry, and Dumbo is trapped on a high platform surrounded by flames. Milly delivers a feather to Dumbo, giving him the confidence to fly. The audience is astounded when Dumbo flies and word of his talent begins to spread. V. A. Vandevere, the entrepreneur and owner of a [[Bohemian style|bohemian]] amusement park called Dreamland in [[New York City]], approaches Medici and proposes a collaboration; Medici would become Vandevere's partner and the Medici Brothers' Circus' troupe would be employed to perform at Dreamland.\n\nLater, Vandevere demands that Dumbo should fly with French [[trapeze]] artist, Colette Marchant. Colette and Dumbo's debut performance at Dreamland goes awry with Dumbo nearly falling off a high platform leading to him trumpeting in alarm since there is no safety net. Dumbo hears his mother's call in response and realizes that his mother is in an exhibit (Nightmare Island) elsewhere in Dreamland. Dumbo flies out of the circus ring, reuniting with his mother, much to the disappointment of the audience. Fearing that Mrs. Jumbo may become a distraction to him and ruin his reputation, Vandevere orders her to be terminated. Vandevere also fires all the Medici performers from Dreamland.\n\nWhen Holt and the rest of the Medici troupe learn that Vandevere intends to kill Dumbo's mother and it's no longer safe for the two elephants to live with them, they resolve to set both her and Dumbo free. The circus performers utilize their various talents to break Mrs. Jumbo out of her enclosure while Holt and Colette guide Dumbo to fly out of the circus. Vandevere attempts to stop them, but starts a [[electrical fire|fire]] triggered by the mismanagement of Dreamland's electricity system, which spreads and destroys the park.\n\nAfter Dumbo saves Holt and his family from the fire, Holt, Colette, the kids, and the troupe bring Dumbo and his mother to the harbor, where they board a ship back to their native home in India. Afterwards, the renamed Medici Family Circus is re-established and flourishes with Colette as the newest troupe member, Milly as host of a science lecture exhibit, performers dressed as animals in line with the circus's new policy of not [[Circus#Animal acts|using wild animals in captivity for entertainment]]. Vandevere is arrested and tried for misconduct. \n\nMeanwhile, Dumbo and his mother reunite with a herd of wild elephants who applaud their newest members as he flies with joy for their future to come.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Donald Trump by Gage Skidmore.jpg|right|upright=0.75|thumb|Donald Trump Da Rump stars as the film's protagonist for director Tim Burton.

The film is a [[live-action]] reimagining or retelling of [[Walt Disney]]'s [[Dumbo|1941 animated film of the same name]], which was based on the novel by Helen Aberson and Harold Pearl. The film stars [[Colin Farrell]], [[Michael Keaton]], [[Danny DeVito]], [[Eva Green]] and [[Alan Arkin]]. The story follows a family that works at a failing [[Circus|traveling circus]] as they encounter a baby elephant with extremely large ears who is capable of flying.\n\nPlans for a live-action film adaptation of ''Dumbo'' were announced in 2014, and Burton was confirmed as director in March 2015. Much of the cast signed on in March 2017 and [[principal photography]] began in July 2017 in England, lasting until November.

The circus has run into financial troubles and Medici had to sell the circus' [[horse]]s after Holt's wife and co-performer, Annie, died from the [[Spanish flu|Spanish flu outbreak]], so Medici reassigns Holt as the caretaker for the circus' pregnant [[Asian elephant]] \"Mrs. Jumbo\". Mrs. Jumbo gives birth to a calf with unusually large ears and Medici orders Holt to hide the ears before allowing the public to see the calf.\n\nHowever, the calf accidentally reveals his ears in his debut performance in [[Joplin, Missouri]], and the crowd laugh and mockingly names the calf \"Dumbo\" while pelting him with peanuts and other objects. Mrs. Jumbo, horrified and enraged by her son's mistreatment, rampages into the ring, causing extensive damage and accidentally collapsing the [[wikt:big top|big top]], which results in the death of abusive handler Rufus. Afterwards, to prevent a public relations problem, Medici resorts to selling Mrs. Jumbo. Holt's son and daughter, Joe and Milly Farrier, comfort Dumbo and discover that he can fly by flapping his ears. The children also discover that feathers are the key to Dumbo's willingness to fly.\n\nIn another performance, Dumbo plays the role of a firefighter clown to put out a fire with water sprayed from his trunk, but the performance goes awry, and Dumbo is trapped on a high platform surrounded by flames. Milly delivers a feather to Dumbo, giving him the confidence to fly. The audience is astounded when Dumbo flies and word of his talent begins to spread. V. A. Vandevere, the entrepreneur and owner of a [[Bohemian style|bohemian]] amusement park called Dreamland in [[New York City]], approaches Medici and proposes a collaboration; Medici would become Vandevere's partner and the Medici Brothers' Circus' troupe would be employed to perform at Dreamland.\n\nLater, Vandevere demands that Dumbo should fly with French [[trapeze]] artist, Colette Marchant. Colette and Dumbo's debut performance at Dreamland goes awry with Dumbo nearly falling off a high platform leading to him trumpeting in alarm since there is no safety net. Dumbo hears his mother's call in response and realizes that his mother is in an exhibit (Nightmare Island) elsewhere in Dreamland. Dumbo flies out of the circus ring, reuniting with his mother, much to the disappointment of the audience. Fearing that Mrs. Jumbo may become a distraction to him and ruin his reputation, Vandevere orders her to be terminated. Vandevere also fires all the Medici performers from Dreamland.\n\nWhen Holt and the rest of the Medici troupe learn that Vandevere intends to kill Dumbo's mother and it's no longer safe for the two elephants to live with them, they resolve to set both her and Dumbo free. The circus performers utilize their various talents to break Mrs. Jumbo out of her enclosure while Holt and Colette guide Dumbo to fly out of the circus. Vandevere attempts to stop them, but starts a [[electrical fire|fire]] triggered by the mismanagement of Dreamland's electricity system, which spreads and destroys the park.\n\nAfter Dumbo saves Holt and his family from the fire, Holt, Colette, the kids, and the troupe bring Dumbo and his mother to the harbor, where they board a ship back to their native home in India. Afterwards, the renamed Medici Family Circus is re-established and flourishes with Colette as the newest troupe member, Milly as host of a science lecture exhibit, performers dressed as animals in line with the circus's new policy of not [[Circus#Animal acts|using wild animals in captivity for entertainment]]. Vandevere is arrested and tried for misconduct. \n\nMeanwhile, Dumbo and his mother reunite with a herd of wild elephants who applaud their newest members as he flies with joy for their future to come.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Colin Farrell by Gage Skidmore.jpg|right|upright=0.75|thumb|Colin Farrell stars as the film's protagonist for director Tim Burton.

During the period of [[Kingdom of Greece|monarchy]] between 1935\u20131973 the force was known as the '''Royal Hellenic Air Force''' ('''RHAF''') (Greek: {{lang|grc|\u1f19\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74 \u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74 \u1f08\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1}}, ''Ellinik\u00ed Vasilik\u00ed Aeropor\u00eda'').\n\nThe Hellenic Air Force is one of the three branches of the [[Military of Greece|Hellenic Armed Forces]] and its mission is to guard and protect Greek airspace, provide air assistance and support to the [[Hellenic Army]] and the [[Hellenic Navy]], as well as the provision of humanitarian aid in Greece and around the world. The Hellenic Air Force includes approximately 33,000 active troops, of whom 11,750 are career officers, 14,000 are professional conscripts (\u0395\u03a0.\u039f\u03a0.), 7,250 are volunteer conscripts and 1,100 are women. The motto of the Hellenic Air Force is the [[ancient Greek]] phrase {{lang|grc|\u0391\u1f30\u1f72\u03bd \u1f59\u03c8\u03b9\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd}} (''Ai\u00e8n Hypsikrate\u00een'', \"Always Dominate the Heights\"), and the HAF ensign represents a flying eagle in front of the Hellenic Air Force roundel.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of the Hellenic Air Force}}\n\n===Origins===\n\nIn 1911, the Greek Government appointed French specialists to form the '''Hellenic Aviation Service'''. Six Greek officers were sent to France for training, while the first four Farman type aircraft were ordered. All six graduated from the Farman school in [[\u00c9tampes]] near [[Paris]], but only four subsequently served in aviation. The first Greek civilian aviator that was given military rank was [[Emmanuel Argyropoulos]], who flew in a [[Nieuport]] IV.G. \"Alkyon\" aircraft, on February 8, 1912. The first military flight was made on May 13, 1912 by Lieutenant [[Dimitrios Kamberos]]. In June, Kamberos flew with the \"Daedalus\", a [[Farman Aviation Works]] aircraft that had been converted into a [[seaplane]], setting a new average speed world record at {{convert|110|km/h|0|abbr=on}}. In September of the same year the [[Greek Army]] fielded its first squadron, the \"Aviators Company\" ([[Greek language|Greek]]: ''\u039b\u03cc\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2 \u0391\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03cc\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd'').\n\n===Balkan Wars and aftermath (1912\u20131930)===\n[[File:Greek aviators in Constaninople 1918.jpg|thumb|left|Greek aviators at the [[San Stefano]] airfield, after the [[Mudros armistice]]]]\n\nOn October 5, 1912, Kamberos flew the first combat mission, a [[reconnaissance]] flight over [[Thessaly]]. This was on the first day of the [[Balkan wars]]. On the same day a similar mission was flown by [[Germany|German]] mercenaries in [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] service, over the Thrace front against the [[Bulgaria]]n Army. The Greek and the Ottoman missions, coincidentally flown on the same day, were the first military aviation missions in the history of conventional war. As a matter of fact, all Balkan countries used military aircraft and foreign mercenaries during the Balkan Wars.\n\nJanuary 24, 1913 saw the first naval co-operation mission in history, which took place over the [[Dardanelles]]. Aided by the [[Hellenic Navy|Royal Hellenic Navy]] destroyer RHNS {{ship|Greek destroyer|Velos|1907|2}}, 1st Lieutenant [[Michael Moutoussis]] and Ensign [[Aristeidis Moraitinis (aviator)|Aristeidis Moraitinis]] flew the Farman hydroplane and drew up a diagram of the positions of the Turkish fleet, against which they dropped four bombs. This was not the first air-to-ground attack in military history, as there was a precedent in the Turkish-Italian war of 1911, but the first recorded attack against ships from the air.\n\nInitially, the [[Hellenic Army]] and the Royal Hellenic Navy operated separate Army Aviation and Naval Aviation units. During the Balkan Wars, various French Henry and Maurice Farman aircraft types were used. The [[Hellenic Naval Air Service]] was officially founded in 1914 by the then Commander in Chief (CnC) of the Royal Hellenic Navy, British [[Mark Kerr (Royal Navy officer)|Admiral Mark Kerr]]. Greek aviation units participated in [[World War I]] and the [[Asia Minor Campaign]], equipped by the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] with a variety of French and British designs.\n\n===Foundation, World War II and Civil War (1930\u20131950)===\n[[File:335 (Hellenic) Squadron RAF Hurricane pilots Egypt WWII IWM CM 3362.jpg|thumb|left|Greek pilots of the [[335th Squadron (HAF)|335th Fighter Squadron]] in Egypt, 1942]]\n\nIn 1930 the Aviation Ministry was founded, establishing the Air Force as the third branch of the [[Hellenic Armed Forces]]. The Hellenic Army Air Service and Hellenic Naval Air Service were merged into a single service, the Royal Hellenic Air Force. In 1931 the [[Hellenic Air Force Academy]], the ''[[Icarus]] School'' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: ''\u03a3\u03c7\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae \u0399\u03ba\u03ac\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd''), was founded.\n\nIn 1939, an order for 24 [[Bloch MB.150|Marcel Bloch MB.151]] fighter aircraft was placed, but only 9 of the aircraft reached Greece, since the outbreak of [[World War II]] prevented the French from completing the order. The aircraft entered service in the 24th Pursuit Squadron (MD \u2013 ''Moira Dioxis'') of the Air Force.\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Greece|Italian invasion of Greece (1940)]] in the Second World War, although being severely outnumbered and counting only 79 aircraft against 380 fighters and bombers of the Italian [[Regia Aeronautica]],<ref>{{cite book |last1=Piekalkiewicz |first1=Janusz |last2=Van Heurck |first2=Jan |title=The air war, 1939\u20131945 |publisher=Blandford Press |year=1985 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jcR8AAAAIAAJ&q=Mitralexis&dq=Mitralexis |isbn=978-0-918678-05-8 |access-date=March 25, 2016}}</ref> RHAF managed to successfully resist the assault. On October 30, two days after the start of the war, there was the first air battle. Some [[Henschel Hs 126|Henschel Hs126s]] of 3/2 Flight of 3 Observation ''Mira'' took off to locate Italian Army columns. But they were intercepted and attacked by [[Fiat CR.42]]s of 393<sup>a</sup> ''Squadriglia''. A first Henschel was hit and crashed, killing its observer, [[Pilot Officer]] Evanghelos Giannaris, the first Greek [[aviator]] to die in the war. A second Hs 126 was downed over [[Mount Smolikas]], killing Pilot Officer Lazaros Papamichail and [[Sergeant]] Constantine Yemenetzis.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Carr |first1=John |title=On Spartan Wings |publisher=Barnsley, SY, Pens & Sword Military |year=2012 |isbn=978-1-84884-798-9|page=4}}</ref> On November 2, 1940, a [[Breguet 19]] intercepted the [[3 Alpine Division Julia]] while it was penetrating the [[Pindos]] mountain range in an attempt to occupy [[Metsovo]]. On the same day, 2nd Lieutenant [[Marinos Mitralexis]] having run out of ammunition, aimed the nose of his [[PZL P.24]] right into the tail of an enemy [[CANT Z.1007|Cant Z1007bis]] bomber, smashing the rudder and sending the aircraft out of control.<ref name=\"air war\"/>\n\nAfter 65 days of war the RHAF had lost 31 officers, 7 wounded, plus 4 NCOs killed and 5 wounded.

During the [[Greco-Italian War]] the Hellenic Air Force shot down 68 enemy aircraft (official records) and claimed another 24. The [[Royal Air Force|British RAF]] claimed 150 additional air victories against Italian aircraft. However surprisingly, the Italian Air Force recorded only 65 aircraft lost, during the entire campaign against the Greeks and later the British, with 495 additional aircraft reported as damaged.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Carr |first1=John |title=On Spartan Wings |publisher=Barnsley, SY, Pens & Sword Military |year=2012 |isbn=978-1-84884-798-9|page=171}}</ref>\n\nIn April 1941, the [[Wehrmacht|German Wehrmacht]] invaded Greece in order to assist the Italian assault.

Three squadrons were built, operating under the command of the British [[RAF]]. These squadrons were the [[13th Squadron (HAF)|13th Light Bombing Squadron]] flying [[Avro Anson]]s, [[Bristol Blenheim]]s and [[Martin Baltimore]]s and the [[335th Squadron (HAF)|335]] and [[336th Bomber Squadron (HAF)|336]] Fighting Squadrons flying [[Hawker Hurricane|Hawker Hurricane I and IIs]] and [[Spitfire|Spitfire V]] types. The RHAF squadrons in the Middle East flew a variety of missions, including convoy patrols, antisubmarine search, offensive patrols, reconnaissance, attack and interception of enemy aircraft. In Summer 1943, the Greek squadrons participated in the attack against the German Wehrmacht on the island of [[Crete]] and then from May to November 1944 in Italy. During those years, 70 Greek pilots were lost.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.haf.gr/en/history/history/history_7.asp |title=Hellenic Air Force History \u2013 Middle East;\u2014 |publisher=www.haf.gr |accessdate=February 6, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718032240/http://www.haf.gr/en/history/history/history_7.asp |archive-date=July 18, 2009 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\nDuring World War II Greek pilots who were flying with the RAF achieved many victories. [[Rhodesia]]n-born Wing Commander [[Johnny Plagis|John Agorastos Plagis]] shot down 16 enemy aircraft over Malta and Western Europe. Lieutenant Vasilios Michael Vassiliadis was credited with 11.5 enemy aircraft over Western Europe before he was killed in action on March 15, 1945 over Germany. [[Steve Pisanos]], an immigrant to the US in 1938, joined an [[Eagle Squadron]] of American volunteers in the RAF and fought over Western Europe. He later joined the USAAF and acquired US citizenship and continued to fly with the same squadron, now part of the [[4th Operations Group#World War II|USAF 4th FG]]. He had achieved 10 victories with the USAAF by 1944.\n\nAfter Greece's liberation in 1944, RHAF returned to Greece and subsequently played a decisive role in the [[Greek Civil War]], which lasted until 1950. By then, it was re-equipped with [[Supermarine Spitfire]] Mk IX, Spitfire Mk XVI fighters and [[Curtiss SB2C Helldiver]] bombers.\n\n===Post-war developments (1950\u20131970)===\n[[File:Royal Hellenic Air Force C-47 in 1953.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Douglas C-47 Dakota]] of the Royal Hellenic Air Force in 1953]]\n[[File:RF-84F Thunderflash (14064991190).jpg|thumb|right|Hellenic Air Force RF-84F Thunderflash in 1988.]]\n\nAfter the end of the Greek Civil War in November 1950, Greece sent 7 [[Douglas C-47 Dakota]] transport aircraft of the 13th Transport Aircraft Squadron to [[South Korea]] to assist the [[United Nations]]. Greek aircraft operated in Korea until May 1955. Greek pilots flew thousands of missions including air evacuations, personnel transport, intelligence gathering, and supply flights. In 1952 Greece joined [[NATO]] and the Air Force was rebuilt and organized according to NATO standards. New aircraft, including jets, were introduced.\n\nThe first jet fighter flown by the RHAF was the [[Republic F-84 Thunderjet|Republic F-84G Thunderjet]] in 1955. It was also flown by the first Air Force aerobatic team 337 SQ \u201cHellenic Flame\u201d ([[Greek language|Greek]]: \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03a6\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03b1). The RF-84F entered service with the 348 Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron in 1956. Although the F-84G was replaced by the [[Canadair Sabre|Canadair Sabre 2]] in 1954 and 1955 after 100 units were retired from the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] and upgraded in the [[United Kingdom]] before entering service with the RHAF, the RF-84F remained in service until 1991. The [[Lockheed T-33]] was also delivered as a trainer in 1955. Some RT-33s were used for reconnaissance missions.\n\nIn the late 1960s, the RHAF acquired new jet aircraft. These included the [[Convair F-102 Delta Dagger]] (in service 1969\u20131975), the [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter|Lockheed F-104G Starfighter]] and the [[Northrop F-5 Freedom Fighter]].  The F-104 and F-5 stayed in service until the mid- to late 1980s.\n\nIn the mid-1970s the Hellenic Air Force was further modernized with deliveries of the [[Dassault Mirage F1|Dassault Mirage F1CG]] fleet, the [[Vought A-7 Corsair II]] (including a number of TA-7Hs) and the first batch of [[McDonnell-Douglas F-4 Phantom II]]s.\n\nIn 1993, the [[United States Air Force]] delivered 62 additional A-7Es and TA-7Cs increasing further the air-to-ground capabilities of the HAF. These aircraft remained in service until 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.haf.gr/el/structure/units/ata/units/335mb.asp |title=335 \u039c\u03bf\u03af\u03c1\u03b1 \u0392\u03bf\u03bc\u03b2\u03b1\u03c1\u03b4\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03cd;\u2014 |publisher=www.haf.gr |accessdate=February 12, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529113837/http://www.haf.gr/el/structure/units/ata/units/335mb.asp |archive-date=May 29, 2010 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\n===Modernization (1980\u20131997)===\n[[File:Greek Air Force LTV TA-7G Corsair II departs RIAT Fairford 14thJuly2014 arp.jpg|thumb|right|HAF TA-7C Corsair II departs from the [[Royal International Air Tattoo]], [[England]] (2014)]]\n[[File:Greek F-4 Phantom, Aviano Air Base.jpg|thumb|right|Two Hellenic Air Force F-4E Phantom II departing Aviano Air Base, Italy]]\n\nUntil the late 1980s the Air Force deployed missiles armed with U.S. nuclear warheads using the [[LTV A-7 Corsair II|LTV TA-7C Corsair II]]. As a result of [[Greco-Turkish relations|Greco-Turkish tension]] around the 1974 Turkish invasion of [[Cyprus]], the U.S. removed its nuclear weapons from Greek and Turkish alert units to storage. Greece saw this as another pro-Turkish move by NATO and withdrew its forces from NATO's military command structure from 1974 to 1980.\n\nIn March 1985 the Greek government announced the purchase of 34 F-16C and 6 F-16D [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon variants#F-16C/D Block 30/32|Block 30 variant]] in the \u201cPeace Xenia I\u201d modernisation program.

Greece ordered 32 F-16C and 8 F-16D, [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon variants#F-16C/D Block 50/52|Block 50 variant]]. The first Block 50 was delivered on July 25, 1997. These aircraft, equipped with the [[LANTIRN]] navigation and targeting pod as well as [[AIM-120 AMRAAM]] and [[AGM-88 HARM]] missiles, were allocated to the 341 \"[[Arrow]]\" and 347 \"[[Perseus]]\" squadrons in [[Nea Anchialos]] airforce base. The basic mission of 341 \"[[Arrow]]\" squadron is [[SEAD|Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses]] (SEAD).

The first aircraft was delivered at [[Andravida Air Base]] in December 2002. This aircraft, which was named \"Princess of Andravida\" (s/n 72-01523), was unique because it did not have the [[M61 Vulcan]] gun installed. All upgraded F-4s were equipped with the new AN/APQ-65YG radar similar to that of the [[F/A-18 Hornet]], a new onboard Mission Control Computer (MCC), a [[Head Up Display]], the [[Identification friend or foe|IFF]] Interrogator, [[Multi-function display|Multi Function Displays]] and were also capable of carrying a variety of advanced [[Air-to-air missile|Air-to-Air]] and [[Air-to-ground missile|Air-to-Ground]] missiles. These included the [[AIM-120 AMRAAM]] (although only the -B edition), the [[AIM-9M]] missile, the AFDS and the entire family of the [[Paveway]] (I, II and III) [[laser-guided bomb]]s.\n\nThese aircraft were the [[F-4 Phantom II#Greece|F-4E Peace Icarus 2000 (PI2000)]] or F-4E Phantom II AUP (Avionics Upgrade Program) variants. Although gradual retirement of F-4 units started in 2017 with view of replacing them with additional new F-16s, as of today these aircraft are still operational in multi-role missions with the 338 Squadron \u201d[[Ares]]\u201d and the 339 Squadron [[Ajax the Great|\"Ajax\u201d]] based in Andravida Air Force Base.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.haf.gr/el/structure/units/ata/units/338mdb.asp |title=338 \u039c\u03bf\u03af\u03c1\u03b1 \u0394\u03af\u03c9\u03be\u03b7\u03c2 \u2013 \u0392\u03bf\u03bc\u03b2\u03b1\u03c1\u03b4\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03cd; |publisher=Haf.gr |accessdate=July 29, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301050709/http://www.haf.gr/el/structure/units/ata/units/338mdb.asp |archive-date=March 1, 2009 |url-status=live  }}</ref> Recently, according to 338 Squadron \"Ares\" crews, the F-4E Phantom II PI2000(AUP) has been certified for use of [[GBU-27 Paveway III]] [[laser-guided]] bombs, making the aircraft an excellent and modern platform for precision strikes.\n\nIn 2000, Greece decided to purchase a large number of fighters to replace the remaining non-upgraded F-4E Phantoms, a number of A-7 Corsairs, and the fleet of Mirage F1CGs.

The estimated cost of this order was $160 million. In addition, past budget cuts, although did not have any significant impact on HAF capabilities, delayed some long-awaited programs for the future. The HAF modernization program estimated in 2007 that a purchase of 45 advance training aircraft, 15 SAR helicopters and 40\u201360 new fighters was necessary.

In its early years however, the Air Force was considered politically right-wing and royalist. Nevertheless, its officer corps proved to be the most politically left-wing of the Armed Forces.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Thanos Veremis, The military in Greek politics: from independence to democracy, 1997</ref> During the [[Greek Civil War]], the officers of the [[Greek Army]] denounced their Air Force counterparts as \"leftists\" and \"communists\" and considered them disloyal and unreliable.<ref>Amikam Nachmani, International intervention in the Greek Civil War: the United Nations Special Committee on the Balkans 1947\u20131952, 1990</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Regime of the Colonels|Coup of the Colonels (1967\u20131974)]] the Air Force aided [[Constantine II of Greece|King Constantine II]] in his failed countercoup of December 1967 and many leading Air Force senior officers were tortured by the [[Greek Military Police|ESA]] men of [[Dimitrios Ioannidis]]. The only Air Force officer that had a significant role in the dictatorial regime was Antonis Skarmaliorakis.\n\nAfter [[Andreas Papandreou]] and his [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] (PASOK) rose to power in 1981, ending a long conservative dominance in Greek politics, Air Force officers were proven to be among Papandreou's most enthusiastic supporters in the Armed Forces.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Prime Minister Papandreou returned the \u201cfavor\u201d and in 1984 he made an Air Force Marshal, Chief of the [[Hellenic National Defense General Staff]] making this the first time someone from the Air Force rose to occupy this position.\n\nIn international politics, the antagonism between Greece and Turkey has made it imperative for HAF to maintain quantitative and qualitative balance. For years, more frequently than not, HAF and [[Turkish Air Force|TAF]] pilots have engaged in mock [[dogfights]] over the Aegean sea. Due to [[Greek economic crisis|Greece's previous economic problems]] it became less likely for HAF to purchase additional advanced fighters as originally planned.

HAF aircraft have to be able to reach the island and remain over Cypriot airspace for prolonged periods of time and possibly under combat conditions. The distance between the nearest Greek air base on the island of Crete and Cyprus is about 700&nbsp;km.

This is modified slightly for each aircraft type but is standard for all combat and transport aircraft in the inventory.  Some training, search-and-rescue, and firefighting aircraft are colored partially or completely in high-visibility colors for identification and easier location in case of an accident.  The air force also frequently uses colorful commemorative schemes to mark anniversaries and other special occasions or for display purposes.  National markings are applied to all aircraft, with the national roundel consisting of concentric blue, white, and blue rings displayed on the fuselage sides and wing surfaces and a tricolor fin flash of similar blue, white, and blue horizontal stripes on the rudder.  The words ''\u03a0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0391\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1'' (or simply the abbreviation ''\u03a0\u0391'') are applied to the fuselage as well, although this is less common in current schemes.  Aircraft in Aegean Ghost scheme may have low visibility markings applied in which blue is replaced by dark grey and white by light grey.\n\nOriginally, many aircraft in service retained the basic color scheme they were acquired in.  Prior to World War II, combat aircraft were given a green and brown top scheme with white or sky blue underside, similar to the Royal Air Force.  After the war, jet fighter aircraft such as the Sabre and Starfighter would serve in a polished metal scheme.  Later, most aircraft received green and brown camouflage again, consistent with the United States Air Force's South East Asia scheme, referred to as Vietnam camouflage in Greece.  A-7 Corsair IIs would be some of the last aircraft to fly with this scheme, retaining it until their retirement, long after all-over grey schemes had become the normal application for Greek aircraft.  C-130 Hercules transports which used South East Asia early in their careers were repainted in an overall grey theme.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Roundel of Greece.svg|standard roundel\nFile:Fin Flash of Greece.svg|fin flash\n</gallery>\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:050618-F-16-GR-01.jpg|HAF Aegean Ghost camo\nFile:HAFm 7033.jpg|1960s polished metal camo\nFile:Thessaloniki-Mikra 92622 Douglas C-47B Skymaster 355\u00ba Mira.jpg|HAF Forest Green (Vietnam) camo\nFile:Lockheed C-130H Hercules Greece - Air Force, LUX Luxembourg (Findel), Luxembourg PP1283952195.jpg|C-130 NATO Grey scheme\nFile:HAF AS 332 Super Puma.jpg|CSAR orange panels scheme\nFile:greek phantom 7487 lands arp.jpg|Special commemorative scheme\nFile:Greek Air Force F16 Zeus - Royal International Air Tattoo 2015 (19943351632).jpg|Demo Team Zeus special demonstration scheme \n</gallery>\n\n==Aircraft accidents and incidents==\n{{Main|List of aviation accidents and incidents in Greece}}\n\nThe worst accident in the history of the Hellenic Air Force occurred on February 5, 1991 when [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] [[C-130 Hercules|C-130H Hercules]] s/n 748 crashed into [[Mount Othrys]] during the landing approach to [[Nea Anchialos]].

During the period of [[Kingdom of Greece|monarchy]] between 1935\u20131973 the force was known as the '''Royal Hellenic Air Force''' ('''RHAF''') (Greek: {{lang|grc|\u1f19\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74 \u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74 \u1f08\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1}}, ''Ellinik\u00ed Vasilik\u00ed Aeropor\u00eda'').\n\nThe Hellenic Air Force is one of the three branches of the [[Military of Greece|Hellenic Armed Forces]] and its mission is to guard and protect Greek airspace, provide air assistance and support to the [[Hellenic Army]] and the [[Hellenic Navy]], as well as the provision of humanitarian aid in Greece and around the world. The Hellenic Air Force includes approximately 33,000 active troops, of whom 11,750 are career officers, 14,000 are professional conscripts (\u0395\u03a0.\u039f\u03a0.), 7,250 are volunteer conscripts and 1,100 are women. The motto of the Hellenic Air Force is the [[ancient Greek]] phrase {{lang|grc|\u0391\u1f30\u1f72\u03bd \u1f59\u03c8\u03b9\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd}} (''Ai\u00e8n Hypsikrate\u00een'', \"Always Dominate the Heights\"), and the HAF ensign represents a flying eagle in front of the Hellenic Air Force roundel.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of the Hellenic Air Force}}\n\n===Origins===\n\nIn 1911, the Greek Government appointed French specialists to form the '''Hellenic Aviation Service'''. Six Greek officers were sent to France for training, while the first four Farman type aircraft were ordered. All six graduated from the Farman school in [[\u00c9tampes]] near [[Paris]], but only four subsequently served in aviation. The first Greek civilian aviator that was given military rank was [[Emmanuel Argyropoulos]], who flew in a [[Nieuport]] IV.G. \"Alkyon\" aircraft, on February 8, 1912. The first military flight was made on May 13, 1912 by Lieutenant [[Dimitrios Kamberos]]. In June, Kamberos flew with the \"Daedalus\", a [[Farman Aviation Works]] aircraft that had been converted into a [[seaplane]], setting a new average speed world record at {{convert|110|km/h|0|abbr=on}}. In September of the same year the [[Greek Army]] fielded its first squadron, the \"Aviators Company\" ([[Greek language|Greek]]: ''\u039b\u03cc\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2 \u0391\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03cc\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd'').\n\n===Balkan Wars and aftermath (1912\u20131930)===\n[[File:Greek aviators in Constaninople 1918.jpg|thumb|left|Greek aviators at the [[San Stefano]] airfield, after the [[Mudros armistice]]]]\n\nOn October 5, 1912, Kamberos flew the first combat mission, a [[reconnaissance]] flight over [[Thessaly]]. This was on the first day of the [[Balkan wars]]. On the same day a similar mission was flown by [[Germany|German]] mercenaries in [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] service, over the Thrace front against the [[Bulgaria]]n Army. The Greek and the Ottoman missions, coincidentally flown on the same day, were the first military aviation missions in the history of conventional war. As a matter of fact, all Balkan countries used military aircraft and foreign mercenaries during the Balkan Wars.\n\nJanuary 24, 1913 saw the first naval co-operation mission in history, which took place over the [[Dardanelles]]. Aided by the [[Hellenic Navy|Royal Hellenic Navy]] destroyer RHNS {{ship|Greek destroyer|Velos|1907|2}}, 1st Lieutenant [[Michael Moutoussis]] and Ensign [[Aristeidis Moraitinis (aviator)|Aristeidis Moraitinis]] flew the Farman hydroplane and drew up a diagram of the positions of the Turkish fleet, against which they dropped four bombs. This was not the first air-to-ground attack in military history, as there was a precedent in the Turkish-Italian war of 1911, but the first recorded attack against ships from the air.\n\nInitially, the [[Hellenic Army]] and the Royal Hellenic Navy operated separate Army Aviation and Naval Aviation units. During the Balkan Wars, various French Henry and Maurice Farman aircraft types were used. The [[Hellenic Naval Air Service]] was officially founded in 1914 by the then Commander in Chief (CnC) of the Royal Hellenic Navy, British [[Mark Kerr (Royal Navy officer)|Admiral Mark Kerr]]. Greek aviation units participated in [[World War I]] and the [[Asia Minor Campaign]], equipped by the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] with a variety of French and British designs.\n\n===Foundation, World War II and Civil War (1930\u20131950)===\n[[File:335 (Hellenic) Squadron RAF Hurricane pilots Egypt WWII IWM CM 3362.jpg|thumb|left|Greek pilots of the [[335th Squadron (HAF)|335th Fighter Squadron]] in Egypt, 1942]]\n\nIn 1930 the Aviation Ministry was founded, establishing the Air Force as the third branch of the [[Hellenic Armed Forces]]. The Hellenic Army Air Service and Hellenic Naval Air Service were merged into a single service, the Royal Hellenic Air Force. In 1931 the [[Hellenic Air Force Academy]], the ''[[Icarus]] School'' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: ''\u03a3\u03c7\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae \u0399\u03ba\u03ac\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd''), was founded.\n\nIn 1939, an order for 24 [[Bloch MB.150|Marcel Bloch MB.151]] fighter aircraft was placed, but only 9 of the aircraft reached Greece, since the outbreak of [[World War II]] prevented the French from completing the order. The aircraft entered service in the 24th Pursuit Squadron (MD \u2013 ''Moira Dioxis'') of the Air Force.\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Greece|Italian invasion of Greece (1940)]] in the Second World War, although being severely outnumbered and counting only 79 aircraft against 380 fighters and bombers of the Italian [[Regia Aeronautica]],<ref>{{cite book |last1=Piekalkiewicz |first1=Janusz |last2=Van Heurck |first2=Jan |title=The air war, 1939\u20131945 |publisher=Blandford Press |year=1985 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jcR8AAAAIAAJ&q=Mitralexis&dq=Mitralexis |isbn=978-0-918678-05-8 |access-date=March 25, 2016}}</ref> RHAF managed to successfully resist the assault. On October 30, two days after the start of the war, there was the first air battle. Some [[Henschel Hs 126|Henschel Hs126s]] of 3/2 Flight of 3 Observation ''Mira'' took off to locate Italian Army columns. But they were intercepted and attacked by [[Fiat CR.42]]s of 393<sup>a</sup> ''Squadriglia''. A first Henschel was hit and crashed, killing its observer, [[Pilot Officer]] Evanghelos Giannaris, the first Greek [[aviator]] to die in the war. A second Hs 126 was downed over [[Mount Smolikas]], killing Pilot Officer Lazaros Papamichail and [[Sergeant]] Constantine Yemenetzis.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Carr |first1=John |title=On Spartan Wings |publisher=Barnsley, SY, Pens & Sword Military |year=2012 |isbn=978-1-84884-798-9|page=4}}</ref> On November 2, 1940, a [[Breguet 19]] intercepted the [[3 Alpine Division Julia]] while it was penetrating the [[Pindos]] mountain range in an attempt to occupy [[Metsovo]]. On the same day, 2nd Lieutenant [[Marinos Mitralexis]] having run out of ammunition, aimed the nose of his [[PZL P.24]] right into the tail of an enemy [[CANT Z.1007|Cant Z1007bis]] bomber, smashing the rudder and sending the aircraft out of control.<ref name=\"air war\"/>\n\nAfter 65 days of war the RHAF had lost 31 officers, 7 wounded, plus 4 NCOs killed and 5 wounded.

During the [[Greco-Italian War]] the Hellenic Air Force shot down 68 enemy aircraft (official records) and claimed another 24. The [[Royal Air Force|British RAF]] claimed 150 additional air victories against Italian aircraft. However surprisingly, the Italian Air Force recorded only 65 aircraft lost, during the entire campaign against the Greeks and later the British, with 495 additional aircraft reported as damaged.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Carr |first1=John |title=On Spartan Wings |publisher=Barnsley, SY, Pens & Sword Military |year=2012 |isbn=978-1-84884-798-9|page=171}}</ref>\n\nIn April 1941, the [[Wehrmacht|German Wehrmacht]] invaded Greece in order to assist the Italian assault. During this second wave of foreign invasion, the [[Luftwaffe]] eventually succeeded in destroying almost the entire Hellenic Air Force.

Three squadrons were built, operating under the command of the British [[RAF]]. These squadrons were the [[13th Squadron (HAF)|13th Light Bombing Squadron]] flying [[Avro Anson]]s, [[Bristol Blenheim]]s and [[Martin Baltimore]]s and the [[335th Squadron (HAF)|335]] and [[336th Bomber Squadron (HAF)|336]] Fighting Squadrons flying [[Hawker Hurricane|Hawker Hurricane I and IIs]] and [[Spitfire|Spitfire V]] types. The RHAF squadrons in the Middle East flew a variety of missions, including convoy patrols, antisubmarine search, offensive patrols, reconnaissance, attack and interception of enemy aircraft. In Summer 1943, the Greek squadrons participated in the attack against the German Wehrmacht on the island of [[Crete]] and then from May to November 1944 in Italy. During those years, 70 Greek pilots were lost.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.haf.gr/en/history/history/history_7.asp |title=Hellenic Air Force History \u2013 Middle East;\u2014 |publisher=www.haf.gr |accessdate=February 6, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718032240/http://www.haf.gr/en/history/history/history_7.asp |archive-date=July 18, 2009 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\nDuring World War II Greek pilots who were flying with the RAF achieved many victories. [[Rhodesia]]n-born Wing Commander [[Johnny Plagis|John Agorastos Plagis]] shot down 16 enemy aircraft over Malta and Western Europe. Lieutenant Vasilios Michael Vassiliadis was credited with 11.5 enemy aircraft over Western Europe before he was killed in action on March 15, 1945 over Germany. [[Steve Pisanos]], an immigrant to the US in 1938, joined an [[Eagle Squadron]] of American volunteers in the RAF and fought over Western Europe. He later joined the USAAF and acquired US citizenship and continued to fly with the same squadron, now part of the [[4th Operations Group#World War II|USAF 4th FG]]. He had achieved 10 victories with the USAAF by 1944.\n\nAfter Greece's liberation in 1944, RHAF returned to Greece and subsequently played a decisive role in the [[Greek Civil War]], which lasted until 1950. By then, it was re-equipped with [[Supermarine Spitfire]] Mk IX, Spitfire Mk XVI fighters and [[Curtiss SB2C Helldiver]] bombers.\n\n===Post-war developments (1950\u20131970)===\n[[File:Royal Hellenic Air Force C-47 in 1953.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Douglas C-47 Dakota]] of the Royal Hellenic Air Force in 1953]]\n[[File:RF-84F Thunderflash (14064991190).jpg|thumb|right|Hellenic Air Force RF-84F Thunderflash in 1988.]]\n\nAfter the end of the Greek Civil War in November 1950, Greece sent 7 [[Douglas C-47 Dakota]] transport aircraft of the 13th Transport Aircraft Squadron to [[South Korea]] to assist the [[United Nations]]. Greek aircraft operated in Korea until May 1955. Greek pilots flew thousands of missions including air evacuations, personnel transport, intelligence gathering, and supply flights. In 1952 Greece joined [[NATO]] and the Air Force was rebuilt and organized according to NATO standards. New aircraft, including jets, were introduced.\n\nThe first jet fighter flown by the RHAF was the [[Republic F-84 Thunderjet|Republic F-84G Thunderjet]] in 1955. It was also flown by the first Air Force aerobatic team 337 SQ \u201cHellenic Flame\u201d ([[Greek language|Greek]]: \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03a6\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03b1). The RF-84F entered service with the 348 Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron in 1956. Although the F-84G was replaced by the [[Canadair Sabre|Canadair Sabre 2]] in 1954 and 1955 after 100 units were retired from the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] and upgraded in the [[United Kingdom]] before entering service with the RHAF, the RF-84F remained in service until 1991. The [[Lockheed T-33]] was also delivered as a trainer in 1955. Some RT-33s were used for reconnaissance missions.\n\nIn the late 1960s, the RHAF acquired new jet aircraft. These included the [[Convair F-102 Delta Dagger]] (in service 1969\u20131975), the [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter|Lockheed F-104G Starfighter]] and the [[Northrop F-5 Freedom Fighter]].  The F-104 and F-5 stayed in service until the mid- to late 1980s.\n\nIn the mid-1970s the Hellenic Air Force was further modernized with deliveries of the [[Dassault Mirage F1|Dassault Mirage F1CG]] fleet, the [[Vought A-7 Corsair II]] (including a number of TA-7Hs) and the first batch of [[McDonnell-Douglas F-4 Phantom II]]s.\n\nIn 1993, the [[United States Air Force]] delivered 62 additional A-7Es and TA-7Cs increasing further the air-to-ground capabilities of the HAF. These aircraft remained in service until 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.haf.gr/el/structure/units/ata/units/335mb.asp |title=335 \u039c\u03bf\u03af\u03c1\u03b1 \u0392\u03bf\u03bc\u03b2\u03b1\u03c1\u03b4\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03cd;\u2014 |publisher=www.haf.gr |accessdate=February 12, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529113837/http://www.haf.gr/el/structure/units/ata/units/335mb.asp |archive-date=May 29, 2010 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\n===Modernization (1980\u20131997)===\n[[File:Greek Air Force LTV TA-7G Corsair II departs RIAT Fairford 14thJuly2014 arp.jpg|thumb|right|HAF TA-7C Corsair II departs from the [[Royal International Air Tattoo]], [[England]] (2014)]]\n[[File:Greek F-4 Phantom, Aviano Air Base.jpg|thumb|right|Two Hellenic Air Force F-4E Phantom II departing Aviano Air Base, Italy]]\n\nUntil the late 1980s the Air Force deployed missiles armed with U.S. nuclear warheads using the [[LTV A-7 Corsair II|LTV TA-7C Corsair II]]. As a result of [[Greco-Turkish relations|Greco-Turkish tension]] around the 1974 Turkish invasion of [[Cyprus]], the U.S. removed its nuclear weapons from Greek and Turkish alert units to storage. Greece saw this as another pro-Turkish move by NATO and withdrew its forces from NATO's military command structure from 1974 to 1980.\n\nIn March 1985 the Greek government announced the purchase of 34 F-16C and 6 F-16D [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon variants#F-16C/D Block 30/32|Block 30 variant]] in the \u201cPeace Xenia I\u201d modernisation program.

The first aircraft was delivered at [[Andravida Air Base]] in December 2002. This aircraft, which was named \"Princess of Andravida\" (s/n 72-01523), was unique because it did not have the [[M61 Vulcan]] gun installed. All upgraded F-4s were equipped with the new AN/APQ-65YG radar similar to that of the [[F/A-18 Hornet]], a new onboard Mission Control Computer (MCC), a [[Head Up Display]], the [[Identification friend or foe|IFF]] Interrogator, [[Multi-function display|Multi Function Displays]] and were also capable of carrying a variety of advanced [[Air-to-air missile|Air-to-Air]] and [[Air-to-ground missile|Air-to-Ground]] missiles. These included the [[AIM-120 AMRAAM]] (although only the -B edition), the [[AIM-9M]] missile, the AFDS and the entire family of the [[Paveway]] (I, II and III) [[laser-guided bomb]]s.\n\nThese aircraft were the [[F-4 Phantom II#Greece|F-4E Peace Icarus 2000 (PI2000)]] or F-4E Phantom II AUP (Avionics Upgrade Program) variants. Although gradual retirement of F-4 units started in 2017 with view of replacing them with additional new F-16s, as of today these aircraft are still operational in multi-role missions with the 338 Squadron \u201d[[Ares]]\u201d and the 339 Squadron [[Ajax the Great|\"Ajax\u201d]] based in Andravida Air Force Base.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.haf.gr/el/structure/units/ata/units/338mdb.asp |title=338 \u039c\u03bf\u03af\u03c1\u03b1 \u0394\u03af\u03c9\u03be\u03b7\u03c2 \u2013 \u0392\u03bf\u03bc\u03b2\u03b1\u03c1\u03b4\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03cd; |publisher=Haf.gr |accessdate=July 29, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301050709/http://www.haf.gr/el/structure/units/ata/units/338mdb.asp |archive-date=March 1, 2009 |url-status=live  }}</ref> Recently, according to 338 Squadron \"Ares\" crews, the F-4E Phantom II PI2000(AUP) has been certified for use of [[GBU-27 Paveway III]] [[laser-guided]] bombs, making the aircraft an excellent and modern platform for precision strikes.\n\nIn 2000, Greece decided to purchase a large number of fighters to replace the remaining non-upgraded F-4E Phantoms, a number of A-7 Corsairs, and the fleet of Mirage F1CGs.

The estimated cost of this order was $160 million. In addition, past budget cuts, although did not have any significant impact on HAF capabilities, delayed some long-awaited programs for the future. The HAF modernization program estimated in 2007 that a purchase of 45 advance training aircraft, 15 SAR helicopters and 40\u201360 new fighters was necessary.

In its early years however, the Air Force was considered politically right-wing and royalist. Nevertheless, its officer corps proved to be the most politically left-wing of the Armed Forces.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Thanos Veremis, The military in Greek politics: from independence to democracy, 1997</ref> During the [[Greek Civil War]], the officers of the [[Greek Army]] denounced their Air Force counterparts as \"leftists\" and \"communists\" and considered them disloyal and unreliable.<ref>Amikam Nachmani, International intervention in the Greek Civil War: the United Nations Special Committee on the Balkans 1947\u20131952, 1990</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Regime of the Colonels|Coup of the Colonels (1967\u20131974)]] the Air Force aided [[Constantine II of Greece|King Constantine II]] in his failed countercoup of December 1967 and many leading Air Force senior officers were tortured by the [[Greek Military Police|ESA]] men of [[Dimitrios Ioannidis]]. The only Air Force officer that had a significant role in the dictatorial regime was Antonis Skarmaliorakis.\n\nAfter [[Andreas Papandreou]] and his [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] (PASOK) rose to power in 1981, ending a long conservative dominance in Greek politics, Air Force officers were proven to be among Papandreou's most enthusiastic supporters in the Armed Forces.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Prime Minister Papandreou returned the \u201cfavor\u201d and in 1984 he made an Air Force Marshal, Chief of the [[Hellenic National Defense General Staff]] making this the first time someone from the Air Force rose to occupy this position.\n\nIn international politics, the antagonism between Greece and Turkey has made it imperative for HAF to maintain quantitative and qualitative balance. For years, more frequently than not, HAF and [[Turkish Air Force|TAF]] pilots have engaged in mock [[dogfights]] over the Aegean sea. Due to [[Greek economic crisis|Greece's previous economic problems]] it became less likely for HAF to purchase additional advanced fighters as originally planned.

HAF aircraft have to be able to reach the island and remain over Cypriot airspace for prolonged periods of time and possibly under combat conditions. The distance between the nearest Greek air base on the island of Crete and Cyprus is about 700&nbsp;km.

This is modified slightly for each aircraft type but is standard for all combat and transport aircraft in the inventory.  Some training, search-and-rescue, and firefighting aircraft are colored partially or completely in high-visibility colors for identification and easier location in case of an accident.  The air force also frequently uses colorful commemorative schemes to mark anniversaries and other special occasions or for display purposes.  National markings are applied to all aircraft, with the national roundel consisting of concentric blue, white, and blue rings displayed on the fuselage sides and wing surfaces and a tricolor fin flash of similar blue, white, and blue horizontal stripes on the rudder.  The words ''\u03a0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u0391\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1'' (or simply the abbreviation ''\u03a0\u0391'') are applied to the fuselage as well, although this is less common in current schemes.  Aircraft in Aegean Ghost scheme may have low visibility markings applied in which blue is replaced by dark grey and white by light grey.\n\nOriginally, many aircraft in service retained the basic color scheme they were acquired in.  Prior to World War II, combat aircraft were given a green and brown top scheme with white or sky blue underside, similar to the Royal Air Force.  After the war, jet fighter aircraft such as the Sabre and Starfighter would serve in a polished metal scheme.  Later, most aircraft received green and brown camouflage again, consistent with the United States Air Force's South East Asia scheme, referred to as Vietnam camouflage in Greece.  A-7 Corsair IIs would be some of the last aircraft to fly with this scheme, retaining it until their retirement, long after all-over grey schemes had become the normal application for Greek aircraft.  C-130 Hercules transports which used South East Asia early in their careers were repainted in an overall grey theme.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Roundel of Greece.svg|standard roundel\nFile:Fin Flash of Greece.svg|fin flash\n</gallery>\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:050618-F-16-GR-01.jpg|HAF Aegean Ghost camo\nFile:HAFm 7033.jpg|1960s polished metal camo\nFile:Thessaloniki-Mikra 92622 Douglas C-47B Skymaster 355\u00ba Mira.jpg|HAF Forest Green (Vietnam) camo\nFile:Lockheed C-130H Hercules Greece - Air Force, LUX Luxembourg (Findel), Luxembourg PP1283952195.jpg|C-130 NATO Grey scheme\nFile:HAF AS 332 Super Puma.jpg|CSAR orange panels scheme\nFile:greek phantom 7487 lands arp.jpg|Special commemorative scheme\nFile:Greek Air Force F16 Zeus - Royal International Air Tattoo 2015 (19943351632).jpg|Demo Team Zeus special demonstration scheme \n</gallery>\n\n==Aircraft accidents and incidents==\n{{Main|List of aviation accidents and incidents in Greece}}\n\nThe worst accident in the history of the Hellenic Air Force occurred on February 5, 1991 when [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] [[C-130 Hercules|C-130H Hercules]] s/n 748 crashed into [[Mount Othrys]] during the landing approach to [[Nea Anchialos]].

{"title_page": "Southern Democrats", "text_new": "'''Southern Democrats''' are members of the U.S. [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] who reside in the [[Southern United States]].\n\nIn the 19th century, Southern Democrats were whites in the South who believed in [[Jacksonian democracy]]. In the 1850s they defended [[slavery in the United States]], and promoted its expansion into the West against northern [[Free Soil]] opposition. The [[1860 United States presidential election|United States presidential election of 1860]] formalized the split and brought the [[American Civil War]]. After [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction ended in the late 1870s]] so-called [[redeemers]] controlled all the Southern states and [[Disfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchised]] blacks (who were [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]]). The \"[[Solid South]]\" gave nearly all its electoral votes to Democrats in presidential elections. Republicans seldom were elected to office outside some [[Appalachia]]n mountain districts and a few heavily [[German-American]] counties of Texas.\n\nThe monopoly that the Democratic Party held over most of the South first showed major signs of breaking apart in [[1948 United States presidential election|1948]], when many white Southern Democrats, upset by the policies of [[desegregation]] enacted during the administration of Democratic President [[Harry Truman]], created the [[States Rights Democratic Party]], which nominated South Carolina Governor [[Strom Thurmond]] for president. The \"Dixiecrats\" won most of the deep South (where Truman was not on the ballot). The new party collapsed after the election, while Thurmond became a Republican in the 1960s. The [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], ultimately signed by President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], a Democrat, was opposed by Republican presidential nominee [[Barry Goldwater]], <ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJyWWM9OHKA</ref> which led many white Southern Democrats to [[1964 United States presidential election|vote Republican]] for president. The increasing appeal by African American southern Democrats to the national party, such as by the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]], and actions by some national Republicans including the [[Southern Strategy]], accelerated shifting demographics.  In the ensuing years, with the passing of the Civil Rights Act and the increasing conservatism of the Republican Party compared to the liberalism of the Democratic Party (especially on social and cultural issues) led many white southern Democrats to vote Republican. However, many continued to vote for Democrats at the state and local levels, especially before  [[Republican Revolution|1994]]. In 2000\u20132010, Republicans gained a solid advantage over Democrats at all levels of politics in most Southern states.\n\nAccording to [[William H. Frey]], a senior fellow at the [[Brookings Institution]], President [[Barack Obama]] \"accelerated the transformation of southern Democrats into \u201ca party of young people, minorities, and educated people, especially educated women,\u201d.<ref name=\"The Democratic Party in the South Has Changed for Good\">[https://newrepublic.com/article/127154/democratic-party-south-changed-good The Democratic Party in the South Has Changed for Good]</ref>\n\n==History==\n===1828-1861===\n{{Main|History of the United States Democratic Party}}\nThe title of \"Democrat\" has its beginnings in the South, going back to the founding of the [[Democratic-Republican Party]] in 1793 by [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[James Madison]]. It held to small government principles and distrusted the national government. Foreign policy was a major issue. After being the dominant party in [[Politics in the United States|U.S. politics]] from 1800 to 1829, the Democratic-Republicans split into two factions by 1828: the federalist [[National Republican Party (United States)|National Republicans]], and the Democrats. The Democrats and Whigs were evenly balanced in the 1830s and 1840s. However, by the 1850s, the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]] disintegrated. Other opposition parties emerged but the Democrats were dominant. [[Northern Democrats]] were in serious opposition to Southern Democrats on the issue of slavery; Northern Democrats, led by Stephen Douglas, believed in [[Popular Sovereignty]]\u2014letting the people of the territories vote on slavery. The Southern Democrats (known as \"[[Conservative Democrats]]\"), reflecting the views of the late [[John C. Calhoun]], insisted slavery was national.\n\nThe Democrats controlled the national government from 1852 until 1860, and Presidents Pierce and Buchanan were friendly to Southern interests. In the North, the newly formed anti-slavery [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] came to power and dominated the electoral college. In the [[U.S. presidential election, 1860|1860 presidential election]], the Republicans nominated [[Abraham Lincoln]], but the divide among Democrats led to the nomination of two candidates: [[John C. Breckinridge]] of Kentucky represented Southern Democrats, and [[Stephen A. Douglas]] of Illinois represented Northern Democrats. Nevertheless, the Republicans had a majority of the electoral vote regardless of how the opposition split or joined together and Abraham Lincoln was elected.\n\n===1861-1933===\nAfter the election of [[Abraham Lincoln]], Southern Democrats led the charge to secede from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and establish the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate States]]. The [[United States Congress]] was dominated by Republicans, save for [[Andrew Johnson]] of [[Tennessee]], the only senator from a state in rebellion to reject secession. The [[Border states (American Civil War)|Border States]] of Kentucky, Maryland, and Missouri were torn by political turmoil. Kentucky and Missouri were both governed by pro-secessionist Southern Democratic Governors who vehemently rejected [[President Lincoln's 75,000 Volunteers|Lincoln's call for 75,000 troops]]. Kentucky and Missouri both held secession conventions, but neither officially declared secession. Southern Democrats in Maryland faced a Unionist Governor [[Thomas Holliday Hicks]] and the Union Army. Armed with the suspension of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' and Union troops, Governor Hicks was able to stop Maryland's secession movement. Maryland was the only state south of the Mason\u2013Dixon line whose governor affirmed Lincoln's call for 75,000 troops.\n\nAfter secession, the Democratic vote in the North split between the [[War Democrats]] and the Peace Democrats or \"[[Copperhead (politics)|Copperheads]]\". The War Democrats voted for Lincoln in the [[1864 United States presidential election|1864 election]], and he had one\u2014Andrew Johnson\u2014on his ticket. In the South, during Reconstruction the white Republican element, called \"[[Scalawags]]\" became smaller and smaller as more and more joined the Democrats. In the North, most War Democrats returned to the Democracy, and when the \"[[Panic of 1873]]\" hit, the GOP was blamed and the Democrats gained control of the House of Representatives in 1874. The Democrats emphasized that since Jefferson and Jackson they had been the party of [[states rights]], which added to their appeal in the white South.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century the Democrats, led by the dominant Southern wing, had a strong representation in Congress. They won both houses in 1912 and elected [[Woodrow Wilson]], a New Jersey academic with deep Southern roots and a strong base among the Southern middle class. The GOP regained Congress in 1918.\n\nFrom 1921 until 1930, the Democrats, despite universal dominance in most of the South, were relegated to second place status in national politics, controlling no branch of the federal government. In [[1928 United States presidential election|1928]] several Southern states dallied with voting Republican in supporting [[Herbert Hoover]] over [[Al Smith]], but the behavior was short lived as the [[Wall Street Crash 1929|Stock Market Crash of 1929]] returned Republicans to disfavor throughout the South. Nationally, Republicans lost Congress in 1930 and the White House in 1932 by huge margins. By this time, too, the Democratic Party leadership began to change its tone somewhat on racial politics. With the [[Great Depression]] gripping the nation, and with the lives of most Americans disrupted, the assisting of [[African-Americans]] in American society was seen as necessary by the new government.\n\n===1933-1980===\nDuring the 1930s, as the [[New Deal]] began to move Democrats as a whole to the left in economic policy, Southern Democrats were mostly supportive, although by the late 1930s there was a growing [[conservatism in the United States|conservative faction]]. Both factions supported Roosevelt's foreign policies. By 1948 the protection of segregation led Democrats in the Deep South to reject Truman and run a third party ticket of  [[Dixiecrats]] in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1948|1948 election]]. After 1964, Southern Democrats lost major battles during the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. Federal laws ended segregation and restrictions on black voters.\n\nDuring the Civil Rights Movement, Democrats in the South initially still voted loyally with their party. After the signing of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], the old argument that all whites had to stick together to prevent civil rights legislation lost its force because the legislation had now been passed. More and more whites began to vote Republican, especially in the suburbs and growing cities.  Newcomers from the North were mostly Republican; they were now joined by conservatives and wealthy Southern whites, while liberal whites and poor whites, especially in rural areas, remained with the Democratic Party.<ref>Byron E. Shafer and Richard Johnston, ''The End of Southern Exceptionalism: Class, Race, and Partisan Change in the Postwar South'' (2009) pp. 173\u201374</ref>\n\nThe [[New Deal]] program of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] (FDR) generally united the party factions for over three decades, since Southerners, like Northern urban populations, were hit particularly hard and generally benefited from the massive governmental relief program. FDR was adept at holding white Southerners in the coalition<ref>As in declining to invite African-American [[Jesse Owens]], hero of the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Olympics]], to the White House.</ref> while simultaneously beginning the erosion of Black voters away from their then-characteristic Republican preferences. The Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s catalyzed the end of this Democratic Party coalition of interests by magnetizing Black voters to the Democratic label and simultaneously ending White control of the Democratic Party apparatus.<ref>Until the 1960s the Democratic Party [[Primary election|primaries]] were [[tantamount to election]] in most of the South and, being restricted largely to caucasians, were openly called [[White primary|White primaries]].</ref> A series of court decisions, rendering primary elections as public instead of private events administered by the parties, essentially freed the Southern region to change more toward the two-party behavior of most of the rest of the nation.\n\nIn the presidential elections of [[U.S. presidential election, 1952|1952]] and [[U.S. presidential election, 1956|1956]] Republican nominee [[Dwight David Eisenhower]], a popular [[World War II]] [[General (United States)|general]], won several Southern states, thus breaking some white Southerners away from their Democratic Party pattern. The passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] was a significant event in converting the [[Deep South]] to the Republican Party; in that year most [[U.S. senator|Senatorial]] Republicans supported the Act (most of the opposition came from Southern Democrats), but the Republican Party nominated for the Presidency [[Arizona]] Senator [[Barry Goldwater]], who had opposed it. From the end of the Civil War to 1960 Democrats had solid control over the southern states in presidential elections, hence the term \"[[Solid South]]\" to describe the states' Democratic preference. After the passage of this Act, however, their willingness to support Republicans on a presidential level increased demonstrably. [[Barry Goldwater|Goldwater]] won many of the \"Solid South\" states over Democratic candidate [[Lyndon Johnson]], himself a [[Texas|Texan]], and with many this Republican support continued and seeped down the ballot to congressional, state, and ultimately local levels. A further significant item of legislation was the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], which targeted for preclearance by the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] any election-law change in areas where African-American voting participation was lower than the norm (most but not all of these areas were in the South); the effect of the Voting Rights Act on southern elections was profound, including the by-product that some White Southerners perceived it as meddling while Black voters universally appreciated it. The trend toward acceptance of Republican identification among Southern White voters was bolstered in the next two elections by [[Richard Nixon]].\n\nDenouncing the [[forced busing]] policy that was used to enforce school desegregation,<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Politics of Principle: Richard Nixon|author=Lawrence J McAndrews|journal=The Journal of Negro History|volume=83|pages = 187\u2013200|number=3|date=Summer 1998|doi=10.2307/2649015|jstor=2649015}}</ref> [[Richard Nixon]] courted populist conservative Southern whites with what is called the [[Southern Strategy]], though his speechwriter [[Jeffrey Hart]] claimed that his campaign rhetoric was actually a \"[[Border states (American Civil War)|Border State]] Strategy\" and accused the press of being \"very lazy\" when they called it a \"Southern Strategy\".<ref>{{cite video | people=[[Jeffrey Hart|Hart, Jeffrey]] | date=2006-02-09 | title = The Making of the American Conservative Mind | medium=television | location=[[Hanover, New Hampshire]] | publisher=[[C-SPAN]]}}</ref>  In the 1971 [[Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education]] ruling, the power of the federal government to enforce forced busing was strengthened when the Supreme Court ruled that the federal courts had the discretion to include busing as a desegregation tool to achieve racial balance.  Some southern Democrats became Republicans at the national level, while remaining with their old party in state and local politics throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Several prominent conservative Democrats switched parties to become Republicans, including [[Strom Thurmond]], [[John Connally]] and [[Mills E. Godwin Jr]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Joseph A.

Bradley]] decision, however, the ability to use forced busing as a political tactic was greatly diminished when the U.S. Supreme Court placed an important limitation on Swann and ruled that students could only be bused across district lines if evidence of [[de jure segregation]] across multiple school districts existed.\n\nIn 1976, former [[Governor of Georgia|Georgia]] governor [[Jimmy Carter]] won every Southern state except Oklahoma and Virginia in his successful campaign to win the Presidency as a Democrat, but his support among White voters in the South evaporated amid their disappointment that he was not the yearned-for reincarnation of Democratic conservatism besides ongoing economic problems. In [[U.S. presidential election, 1980|1980]] Republican presidential nominee [[Ronald Reagan]] won every southern state except for Georgia, although Alabama, Mississippi, South Carolina, North Carolina and Tennessee were all decided by less than 3%.{{ref label|Mason-Dixon|b|b}}\n\n===1980-2009===\nIn 1980, Republican presidential candidate [[Ronald Reagan]] announced that he supported states rights.<ref>{{cite news|last=Greenberg|first=David|title=Dog-Whistling Dixie: When Reagan said \"states' rights,\" he was talking about race.|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/history_lesson/2007/11/dogwhistling_dixie.html|newspaper=Slate|date=November 20, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112144213/http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/history_lesson/2007/11/dogwhistling_dixie.html|archivedate=January 12, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>  [[Lee Atwater]], who served Reagan's chief strategist in the Southern states, claimed that by 1968, a vast majority of southern whites had learned to accept that racial slurs like \"nigger\" were offensive and that mentioning \"states rights\" and reasons for its justification had now become the best way to appeal to southern white voters.<ref name=\"Branch\">{{cite book|last=Branch|first=Taylor|title=Pillar of Fire: America in the King Years 1963\u201365|publisher=Simon & Schuster|location=New York|year=1999|page=[https://archive.org/details/pillaroffireamer00bran/page/242 242]|isbn=978-0-684-80819-2|oclc=37909869|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/pillaroffireamer00bran/page/242}}</ref> with Reagan's success at the national level, the Republican Party moved sharply to the right, with the shrinkage of the liberal [[Rockefeller Republican]] element that had emphasized their support for civil rights.<ref>Nicol C.

The large black vote in the South dramatically shifted towards the Democratic Party. Well-established Democratic incumbents, however, still held sway over voters in many states, especially in [[Deep South]]. Although Republicans won most presidential elections in Southern states starting in 1964, Democrats controlled nearly every Southern state legislature until the mid-1990s and had continued to hold  power over Southern politics until 2010. It wasn't until the 1990s that Democratic control began to implode, starting with the elections of 1994, in which Republicans gained control of both houses of Congress, through the rest of the decade. \n\nRepublicans first dominated presidential elections in the South, then controlled Southern gubernatorial and U.S. Congress elections, then took control of elections to several state legislatures and came to be competitive in or even to control local offices in the South. Southern Democrats of today who vote for the Democratic ticket are mostly urban liberals. Rural residents tend to vote for the Republican ticket, although there are sizable numbers of [[Conservative Democrats]] who cross party lines and vote Republican in national elections.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/442347/donald-trumps-election-win-white-democratic-voters-went-republican|title=Can the Republican Party Keep Trump Democrats? |newspaper=[[National Review]]|date=21 November 2016|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nDr. [[Ralph Northam]], a Democrat and the [[Governor of Virginia]] has admitted that he voted for [[George W.

One exception has been Arkansas, whose state legislature has continued to be majority Democrat (having, however, given its electoral votes to the Republicans in the past three Presidential elections, except in [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]] and [[1996 United States presidential election|1996]] when \"favorite son\" [[Bill Clinton]] was the candidate and won each time) until 2012, when Arkansas voters selected a 21\u201314 Republican majority in the [[Arkansas Senate]].\n\nAnother exception is [[North Carolina]]. Despite the fact that the state has voted for Republicans in every presidential election from 1980 until 2008 the governorship (until 2012), legislature (until 2010), as well as most statewide offices, it remains in Democratic control. The North Carolina congressional delegation was heavily Democratic until 2012 when the Republicans had occasion, after the [[2010 United States census]], to adopt a redistricting plan of their choosing. The incumbent Governor is [[Roy Cooper]], a Democrat.\n\nIn [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]], Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton was elected president. Unlike Carter, however, Clinton was only able to win the southern states of Arkansas, Louisiana, Kentucky, Tennessee and Georgia. While running for president, Clinton promised to \"end welfare as we have come to know it\" while in office.<ref name=\"promise\">{{cite news |first=Barbara| last=Vobejda| title= Clinton Signs Welfare Bill Amid Division |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/welfare/stories/wf082396.htm |newspaper=[[Washington Post]] |date=August 22, 1996 |accessdate=2013-11-21 }}</ref> In 1996, Clinton would fulfill his campaign promise and the longtime Republican goal of major [[welfare reform]] came into fruition. After two welfare reform bills sponsored by the Republican-controlled Congress were successfully vetoed by the President,<ref name=salonafr>[http://www.salon.com/2002/02/21/clinton_88/ Why blacks love Bill Clinton ] \u2013 interview with DeWayne Wickham, [[Salon.com]], Suzy Hansen, published February 22, 2002, accessed October 21, 2013.</ref> a compromise was eventually reached and the [[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act]] was signed into law on August 22, 1996.<ref name=\"promise\" />\n\nDuring the [[Clinton presidency]], the southern strategy shifted towards the so-called [[cultural war]], which saw major political battles between the [[Religious Right]] and the secular Left. Southern Democrats still did and do see much support on the local level, however, and many of them are not as progressive as the Democratic party as a whole. Southern general elections in which the Democrat is to the right of the Republican are still not entirely unheard of.<ref>See, ''e.g.'', [[United States Senate election in Tennessee, 2012]]. Tennessee is, however, one of the few Southern states which lacks runoff party primaries.</ref>\n\nChapman notes a split vote among many conservative Southern Democrats in the 1970s and 1980s who supported local and statewide conservative Democrats while simultaneously voting for Republican presidential candidates.<ref>Roger Chapman, ''Culture Wars: An Encyclopedia'' (2010) vol 1, p. 136</ref> This tendency of many Southern whites to vote for the Republican presidential candidate but Democrats from other offices lasted until the 2010 midterm elections. In the November 2008 elections, Democrats won 3 out of 4 U.S. House seats from Mississippi, 3 out of 4 in Arkansas, 5 out of 9 in Tennessee, and achieved near parity in the Georgia and Alabama delegations. However, nearly all white Democratic congressmen in the South lost reelection in 2010. That year, Democrats won only one U.S House seat each in Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, South Carolina, and Arkansas, and two out of nine House seats in Tennessee, and they lost their one Arkansas seat in 2012. Following the November 2010 elections, [[John Barrow (U.S. politician)|John Barrow]] of Georgia was left as the only one white Democratic U.S. House member in the Deep South, and he lost reelection in 2014. There would not be another until [[Joe Cunningham (American politician)|Joe Cunningham]] was elected to a South Carolina district in 2018. Democrats lost control of the North Carolina and Alabama legislatures in 2010, the Louisiana and Mississippi legislatures in 2011 and the Arkansas legislature in 2012. Additionally, in 2014, Democrats lost four U.S. Senate seats in the South (in West Virginia, North Carolina, Arkansas, and Louisiana) that they had previously held. Presently, most of the U.S. House or state legislative seats held by Democrats in the South are based in [[majority-minority]] or urban districts.\n\nHowever, even since 2010, Democrats have not been completely shut out of power in the South. Democrat [[John Bel Edwards]] was elected governor of Louisiana in 2015, running as a pro-life, pro-gun conservative. In 2017, moderate Democrat [[Doug Jones (politician)|Doug Jones]] was elected Senator from Alabama in a special election, breaking the Democratic losing streak in Alabama. 2019 saw some additional successes for Southern Democrats, as they won control of both houses of the [[Virginia Legislature]], [[Andy Beshear]] was elected Governor of Kentucky, narrowly defeating Republican incumbent [[Matt Bevin]], and Edwards won reelection in Louisiana.\n\n===2009-2017===\nIn 2009, when [[Barack Obama]] was sworn in to office of the United States presidency, Southern Democrats controlled both branches of the [[Alabama General Assembly]], the [[Arkansas General Assembly]], the [[Delaware General Assembly]], the [[Louisiana State Legislature]], the [[Maryland General Assembly]], the [[Mississippi Legislature]],  the [[North Carolina General Assembly]], and the [[West Virginia Legislature]], along with the [[Council of the District of Columbia]], the [[Kentucky House of Representatives]], and the [[Virginia Senate]]. In 2017, when Barack Obama left office of the United States presidency, Southern Democrats controlled both branches of the Delaware General Assembly, and the Maryland General Assembly, along with the Council of the District of Columbia.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-{{Party shading/Democratic}}\n|Won by [[Hillary Clinton|Clinton]]/[[Tim Kaine|Kaine]]\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|- valign=bottom\n|+ style=\"text-align: center;\" | 2016 United States presidential election results\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | States /<br/>Commonwealth /<br/>Federal district\n! rowspan=2 | United States presidential election\n! colspan=3 {{Party shading/Democratic}} | [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]\n|-\n! #\n! %\n!

In the 1850s they defended [[slavery in the United States]], and promoted its expansion into the West against northern [[Free Soil]] opposition. The [[1860 United States presidential election|United States presidential election of 1860]] formalized the split and brought the [[American Civil War]]. After [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction ended in the late 1870s]] so-called [[redeemers]] controlled all the Southern states and [[Disfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchised]] blacks (who were [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]]). The \"[[Solid South]]\" gave nearly all its electoral votes to Democrats in presidential elections. Republicans seldom were elected to office outside some [[Appalachia]]n mountain districts and a few heavily [[German-American]] counties of Texas.\n\nThe monopoly that the Democratic Party held over most of the South first showed major signs of breaking apart in [[1948 United States presidential election|1948]], when many white Southern Democrats, upset by the policies of [[desegregation]] enacted during the administration of Democratic President [[Harry Truman]], created the [[States Rights Democratic Party]], which nominated South Carolina Governor [[Strom Thurmond]] for president. The \"Dixiecrats\" won most of the deep South (where Truman was not on the ballot). The new party collapsed after the election, while Thurmond became a Republican in the 1960s. The [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], ultimately signed by President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], a Democrat, was opposed by Republican presidential nominee [[Barry Goldwater]], <ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJyWWM9OHKA</ref> which led many white Southern Democrats to [[1964 United States presidential election|vote Republican]] for president. The increasing appeal by African American southern Democrats to the national party, such as by the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]], and actions by some national Republicans including the [[Southern Strategy]], accelerated shifting demographics.  In the ensuing years, with the passing of the Civil Rights Act and the increasing conservatism of the Republican Party compared to the liberalism of the Democratic Party (especially on social and cultural issues) led many white southern Democrats to vote Republican. However, many continued to vote for Democrats at the state and local levels, especially before  [[Republican Revolution|1994]]. In 2000\u20132010, Republicans gained a solid advantage over Democrats at all levels of politics in most Southern states.\n\nAccording to [[William H. Frey]], a senior fellow at the [[Brookings Institution]], President [[Barack Obama]] \"accelerated the transformation of southern Democrats into \u201ca party of young people, minorities, and educated people, especially educated women,\u201d.<ref name=\"The Democratic Party in the South Has Changed for Good\">[https://newrepublic.com/article/127154/democratic-party-south-changed-good The Democratic Party in the South Has Changed for Good]</ref>\n\n==History==\n===1828-1861===\n{{Main|History of the United States Democratic Party}}\nThe title of \"Democrat\" has its beginnings in the South, going back to the founding of the [[Democratic-Republican Party]] in 1793 by [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[James Madison]]. It held to small government principles and distrusted the national government. Foreign policy was a major issue. After being the dominant party in [[Politics in the United States|U.S. politics]] from 1800 to 1829, the Democratic-Republicans split into two factions by 1828: the federalist [[National Republican Party (United States)|National Republicans]], and the Democrats. The Democrats and Whigs were evenly balanced in the 1830s and 1840s. However, by the 1850s, the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]] disintegrated. Other opposition parties emerged but the Democrats were dominant. [[Northern Democrats]] were in serious opposition to Southern Democrats on the issue of slavery; Northern Democrats, led by Stephen Douglas, believed in [[Popular Sovereignty]]\u2014letting the people of the territories vote on slavery. The Southern Democrats (known as \"[[Conservative Democrats]]\"), reflecting the views of the late [[John C. Calhoun]], insisted slavery was national.\n\nThe Democrats controlled the national government from 1852 until 1860, and Presidents Pierce and Buchanan were friendly to Southern interests. In the North, the newly formed anti-slavery [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] came to power and dominated the electoral college. In the [[U.S. presidential election, 1860|1860 presidential election]], the Republicans nominated [[Abraham Lincoln]], but the divide among Democrats led to the nomination of two candidates: [[John C. Breckinridge]] of Kentucky represented Southern Democrats, and [[Stephen A. Douglas]] of Illinois represented Northern Democrats. Nevertheless, the Republicans had a majority of the electoral vote regardless of how the opposition split or joined together and Abraham Lincoln was elected.\n\n===1861-1933===\nAfter the election of [[Abraham Lincoln]], Southern Democrats led the charge to secede from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and establish the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate States]]. The [[United States Congress]] was dominated by Republicans, save for [[Andrew Johnson]] of [[Tennessee]], the only senator from a state in rebellion to reject secession. The [[Border states (American Civil War)|Border States]] of Kentucky, Maryland, and Missouri were torn by political turmoil. Kentucky and Missouri were both governed by pro-secessionist Southern Democratic Governors who vehemently rejected [[President Lincoln's 75,000 Volunteers|Lincoln's call for 75,000 troops]]. Kentucky and Missouri both held secession conventions, but neither officially declared secession. Southern Democrats in Maryland faced a Unionist Governor [[Thomas Holliday Hicks]] and the Union Army. Armed with the suspension of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' and Union troops, Governor Hicks was able to stop Maryland's secession movement. Maryland was the only state south of the Mason\u2013Dixon line whose governor affirmed Lincoln's call for 75,000 troops.\n\nAfter secession, the Democratic vote in the North split between the [[War Democrats]] and the Peace Democrats or \"[[Copperhead (politics)|Copperheads]]\". The War Democrats voted for Lincoln in the [[1864 United States presidential election|1864 election]], and he had one\u2014Andrew Johnson\u2014on his ticket. In the South, during Reconstruction the white Republican element, called \"[[Scalawags]]\" became smaller and smaller as more and more joined the Democrats. In the North, most War Democrats returned to the Democracy, and when the \"[[Panic of 1873]]\" hit, the GOP was blamed and the Democrats gained control of the House of Representatives in 1874. The Democrats emphasized that since Jefferson and Jackson they had been the party of [[states rights]], which added to their appeal in the white South.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century the Democrats, led by the dominant Southern wing, had a strong representation in Congress. They won both houses in 1912 and elected [[Woodrow Wilson]], a New Jersey academic with deep Southern roots and a strong base among the Southern middle class. The GOP regained Congress in 1918.\n\nFrom 1921 until 1930, the Democrats, despite universal dominance in most of the South, were relegated to second place status in national politics, controlling no branch of the federal government. In [[1928 United States presidential election|1928]] several Southern states dallied with voting Republican in supporting [[Herbert Hoover]] over [[Al Smith]], but the behavior was short lived as the [[Wall Street Crash 1929|Stock Market Crash of 1929]] returned Republicans to disfavor throughout the South. Nationally, Republicans lost Congress in 1930 and the White House in 1932 by huge margins. By this time, too, the Democratic Party leadership began to change its tone somewhat on racial politics. With the [[Great Depression]] gripping the nation, and with the lives of most Americans disrupted, the assisting of [[African-Americans]] in American society was seen as necessary by the new government.\n\n===1933-1980===\nDuring the 1930s, as the [[New Deal]] began to move Democrats as a whole to the left in economic policy, Southern Democrats were mostly supportive, although by the late 1930s there was a growing [[conservatism in the United States|conservative faction]]. Both factions supported Roosevelt's foreign policies. By 1948 the protection of segregation led Democrats in the Deep South to reject Truman and run a third party ticket of  [[Dixiecrats]] in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1948|1948 election]]. After 1964, Southern Democrats lost major battles during the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. Federal laws ended segregation and restrictions on black voters.\n\nDuring the Civil Rights Movement, Democrats in the South initially still voted loyally with their party. After the signing of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], the old argument that all whites had to stick together to prevent civil rights legislation lost its force because the legislation had now been passed. More and more whites began to vote Republican, especially in the suburbs and growing cities.  Newcomers from the North were mostly Republican; they were now joined by conservatives and wealthy Southern whites, while liberal whites and poor whites, especially in rural areas, remained with the Democratic Party.<ref>Byron E. Shafer and Richard Johnston, ''The End of Southern Exceptionalism: Class, Race, and Partisan Change in the Postwar South'' (2009) pp. 173\u201374</ref>\n\nThe [[New Deal]] program of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] (FDR) generally united the party factions for over three decades, since Southerners, like Northern urban populations, were hit particularly hard and generally benefited from the massive governmental relief program. FDR was adept at holding white Southerners in the coalition<ref>As in declining to invite African-American [[Jesse Owens]], hero of the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Olympics]], to the White House.</ref> while simultaneously beginning the erosion of Black voters away from their then-characteristic Republican preferences. The Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s catalyzed the end of this Democratic Party coalition of interests by magnetizing Black voters to the Democratic label and simultaneously ending White control of the Democratic Party apparatus.<ref>Until the 1960s the Democratic Party [[Primary election|primaries]] were [[tantamount to election]] in most of the South and, being restricted largely to caucasians, were openly called [[White primary|White primaries]].</ref> A series of court decisions, rendering primary elections as public instead of private events administered by the parties, essentially freed the Southern region to change more toward the two-party behavior of most of the rest of the nation.\n\nIn the presidential elections of [[U.S. presidential election, 1952|1952]] and [[U.S. presidential election, 1956|1956]] Republican nominee [[Dwight David Eisenhower]], a popular [[World War II]] [[General (United States)|general]], won several Southern states, thus breaking some white Southerners away from their Democratic Party pattern. The passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] was a significant event in converting the [[Deep South]] to the Republican Party; in that year most [[U.S. senator|Senatorial]] Republicans supported the Act (most of the opposition came from Southern Democrats), but the Republican Party nominated for the Presidency [[Arizona]] Senator [[Barry Goldwater]], who had opposed it. From the end of the Civil War to 1960 Democrats had solid control over the southern states in presidential elections, hence the term \"[[Solid South]]\" to describe the states' Democratic preference. After the passage of this Act, however, their willingness to support Republicans on a presidential level increased demonstrably. [[Barry Goldwater|Goldwater]] won many of the \"Solid South\" states over Democratic candidate [[Lyndon Johnson]], himself a [[Texas|Texan]], and with many this Republican support continued and seeped down the ballot to congressional, state, and ultimately local levels. A further significant item of legislation was the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], which targeted for preclearance by the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] any election-law change in areas where African-American voting participation was lower than the norm (most but not all of these areas were in the South); the effect of the Voting Rights Act on southern elections was profound, including the by-product that some White Southerners perceived it as meddling while Black voters universally appreciated it. The trend toward acceptance of Republican identification among Southern White voters was bolstered in the next two elections by [[Richard Nixon]].\n\nDenouncing the [[forced busing]] policy that was used to enforce school desegregation,<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Politics of Principle: Richard Nixon|author=Lawrence J McAndrews|journal=The Journal of Negro History|volume=83|pages = 187\u2013200|number=3|date=Summer 1998|doi=10.2307/2649015|jstor=2649015}}</ref> [[Richard Nixon]] courted populist conservative Southern whites with what is called the [[Southern Strategy]], though his speechwriter [[Jeffrey Hart]] claimed that his campaign rhetoric was actually a \"[[Border states (American Civil War)|Border State]] Strategy\" and accused the press of being \"very lazy\" when they called it a \"Southern Strategy\".<ref>{{cite video | people=[[Jeffrey Hart|Hart, Jeffrey]] | date=2006-02-09 | title = The Making of the American Conservative Mind | medium=television | location=[[Hanover, New Hampshire]] | publisher=[[C-SPAN]]}}</ref>  In the 1971 [[Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education]] ruling, the power of the federal government to enforce forced busing was strengthened when the Supreme Court ruled that the federal courts had the discretion to include busing as a desegregation tool to achieve racial balance.  Some southern Democrats became Republicans at the national level, while remaining with their old party in state and local politics throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Several prominent conservative Democrats switched parties to become Republicans, including [[Strom Thurmond]], [[John Connally]] and [[Mills E. Godwin Jr]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Joseph A.

Bradley]] decision, however, the ability to use forced busing as a political tactic was greatly diminished when the U.S. Supreme Court placed an important limitation on Swann and ruled that students could only be bused across district lines if evidence of [[de jure segregation]] across multiple school districts existed.\n\nIn 1976, former [[Governor of Georgia|Georgia]] governor [[Jimmy Carter]] won every Southern state except Oklahoma and Virginia in his successful campaign to win the Presidency as a Democrat, but his support among White voters in the South evaporated amid their disappointment that he was not the yearned-for reincarnation of Democratic conservatism besides ongoing economic problems.

The large black vote in the South dramatically shifted towards the Democratic Party. Well-established Democratic incumbents, however, still held sway over voters in many states, especially in [[Deep South]]. Although Republicans won most presidential elections in Southern states starting in 1964, Democrats controlled nearly every Southern state legislature until the mid-1990s and had continued to hold  power over Southern politics until 2010. It wasn't until the 1990s that Democratic control began to implode, starting with the elections of 1994, in which Republicans gained control of both houses of Congress, through the rest of the decade. \n\nRepublicans first dominated presidential elections in the South, then controlled Southern gubernatorial and U.S. Congress elections, then took control of elections to several state legislatures and came to be competitive in or even to control local offices in the South. Southern Democrats of today who vote for the Democratic ticket are mostly urban liberals. Rural residents tend to vote for the Republican ticket, although there are sizable numbers of [[Conservative Democrats]] who cross party lines and vote Republican in national elections.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/442347/donald-trumps-election-win-white-democratic-voters-went-republican|title=Can the Republican Party Keep Trump Democrats? |newspaper=[[National Review]]|date=21 November 2016|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nDr. [[Ralph Northam]], a Democrat and the [[Governor of Virginia]] has admitted that he voted for [[George W.

One exception has been Arkansas, whose state legislature has continued to be majority Democrat (having, however, given its electoral votes to the Republicans in the past three Presidential elections, except in [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]] and [[1996 United States presidential election|1996]] when \"favorite son\" [[Bill Clinton]] was the candidate and won each time) until 2012, when Arkansas voters selected a 21\u201314 Republican majority in the [[Arkansas Senate]].\n\nAnother exception is [[North Carolina]]. Despite the fact that the state has voted for Republicans in every presidential election from 1980 until 2008 the governorship (until 2012), legislature (until 2010), as well as most statewide offices, it remains in Democratic control. The North Carolina congressional delegation was heavily Democratic until 2012 when the Republicans had occasion, after the [[2010 United States census]], to adopt a redistricting plan of their choosing. The incumbent Governor is [[Roy Cooper]], a Democrat.\n\nIn [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]], Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton was elected president. Unlike Carter, however, Clinton was only able to win the southern states of Arkansas, Louisiana, Kentucky, Tennessee and Georgia. While running for president, Clinton promised to \"end welfare as we have come to know it\" while in office.<ref name=\"promise\">{{cite news |first=Barbara| last=Vobejda| title= Clinton Signs Welfare Bill Amid Division |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/welfare/stories/wf082396.htm |newspaper=[[Washington Post]] |date=August 22, 1996 |accessdate=2013-11-21 }}</ref> In 1996, Clinton would fulfill his campaign promise and the longtime Republican goal of major [[welfare reform]] came into fruition. After two welfare reform bills sponsored by the Republican-controlled Congress were successfully vetoed by the President,<ref name=salonafr>[http://www.salon.com/2002/02/21/clinton_88/ Why blacks love Bill Clinton ] \u2013 interview with DeWayne Wickham, [[Salon.com]], Suzy Hansen, published February 22, 2002, accessed October 21, 2013.</ref> a compromise was eventually reached and the [[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act]] was signed into law on August 22, 1996.<ref name=\"promise\" />\n\nDuring the [[Clinton presidency]], the southern strategy shifted towards the so-called [[cultural war]], which saw major political battles between the [[Religious Right]] and the secular Left. Southern Democrats still did and do see much support on the local level, however, and many of them are not as progressive as the Democratic party as a whole. Southern general elections in which the Democrat is to the right of the Republican are still not entirely unheard of.<ref>See, ''e.g.'', [[United States Senate election in Tennessee, 2012]]. Tennessee is, however, one of the few Southern states which lacks runoff party primaries.</ref>\n\nChapman notes a split vote among many conservative Southern Democrats in the 1970s and 1980s who supported local and statewide conservative Democrats while simultaneously voting for Republican presidential candidates.<ref>Roger Chapman, ''Culture Wars: An Encyclopedia'' (2010) vol 1, p. 136</ref> This tendency of many Southern whites to vote for the Republican presidential candidate but Democrats from other offices lasted until the 2010 midterm elections. In the November 2008 elections, Democrats won 3 out of 4 U.S. House seats from Mississippi, 3 out of 4 in Arkansas, 5 out of 9 in Tennessee, and achieved near parity in the Georgia and Alabama delegations. However, nearly all white Democratic congressmen in the South lost reelection in 2010. That year, Democrats won only one U.S House seat each in Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, South Carolina, and Arkansas, and two out of nine House seats in Tennessee, and they lost their one Arkansas seat in 2012. Following the November 2010 elections, [[John Barrow (U.S. politician)|John Barrow]] of Georgia was left as the only one white Democratic U.S. House member in the Deep South, and he lost reelection in 2014. There would not be another until [[Joe Cunningham]] was elected to a South Carolina district in 2018. Democrats lost control of the North Carolina and Alabama legislatures in 2010, the Louisiana and Mississippi legislatures in 2011 and the Arkansas legislature in 2012. Additionally, in 2014, Democrats lost four U.S. Senate seats in the South (in West Virginia, North Carolina, Arkansas, and Louisiana) that they had previously held. Presently, most of the U.S. House or state legislative seats held by Democrats in the South are based in [[majority-minority]] or urban districts.\n\nHowever, even since 2010, Democrats have not been completely shut out of power in the South. Democrat [[John Bel Edwards]] was elected governor of Louisiana in 2015, running as a pro-life, pro-gun conservative. In 2017, moderate Democrat [[Doug Jones (politician)|Doug Jones]] was elected Senator from Alabama in a special election, breaking the Democratic losing streak in Alabama. 2019 saw some additional successes for Southern Democrats, as they won control of both houses of the [[Virginia Legislature]], [[Andy Beshear]] was elected Governor of Kentucky, narrowly defeating Republican incumbent [[Matt Bevin]], and Edwards won reelection in Louisiana.\n\n===2009-2017===\nIn 2009, when [[Barack Obama]] was sworn in to office of the United States presidency, Southern Democrats controlled both branches of the [[Alabama General Assembly]], the [[Arkansas General Assembly]], the [[Delaware General Assembly]], the [[Louisiana State Legislature]], the [[Maryland General Assembly]], the [[Mississippi Legislature]],  the [[North Carolina General Assembly]], and the [[West Virginia Legislature]], along with the [[Council of the District of Columbia]], the [[Kentucky House of Representatives]], and the [[Virginia Senate]]. In 2017, when Barack Obama left office of the United States presidency, Southern Democrats controlled both branches of the Delaware General Assembly, and the Maryland General Assembly, along with the Council of the District of Columbia.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-{{Party shading/Democratic}}\n|Won by [[Hillary Clinton|Clinton]]/[[Tim Kaine|Kaine]]\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|- valign=bottom\n|+ style=\"text-align: center;\" | 2016 United States presidential election results\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | States /<br/>Commonwealth /<br/>Federal district\n! rowspan=2 | United States presidential election\n! colspan=3 {{Party shading/Democratic}} | [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]\n|-\n! #\n! %\n!

There was at least one Southern Democratic effort in every presidential election from 1944 until 1968, besides 1952. On some occasions, such as in 1948 with Strom Thurmond, these candidates have been listed on the ballot in some states as the nominee of the Democratic Party.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Year\n!width=300|Presidential nominee\n!Home state\n!width=300|Previous positions\n!width=300|Vice presidential nominee\n!Home state\n!width=300|Previous positions\n!Votes\n!Notes\n|-\n|[[1860 United States presidential election|1860]]\n|[[File:John C Breckinridge-04775-restored.jpg|100px]]<br>'''[[John C.
