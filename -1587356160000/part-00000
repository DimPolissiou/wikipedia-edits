To support his young family, Jones took a job working in a glove factory and was later employed in construction.\n\n==Career==\n===Rise to fame===\nJones's voice has been described as a \"full-throated, robust [[baritone]]\".<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> He became the frontman in 1963 for Tommy Scott and the Senators, a Welsh [[beat group]]. They soon gained a local following and reputation in [[South Wales]]. In 1964, the group recorded several solo tracks with producer [[Joe Meek]], who took them to various record labels, but they had little success. Later that year, [[Decca Records|Decca]] producer Peter Sullivan saw Tommy Scott and the Senators performing in a club and directed them to manager [[Phil Solomon (music executive)|Phil Solomon]], but the partnership was short-lived.\n\nThe group continued to play gigs at dance halls and [[working men's club]]s in South Wales. One night at the Top Hat in [[Cwmtillery]], Jones was spotted by [[Gordon Mills]], a London-based manager who also originally hailed from [[South Wales]]. Mills became Jones's manager, took the young singer to London, and also renamed him \"Tom Jones\",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/music/sites/tom-jones/pages/biography_02.shtml |title=Music \u2013 Tom Jones \u2013 Tom Jones biography \u2013 part two |website=BBC Wales |accessdate=12 October 2015}}</ref> to exploit the popularity of the Academy Award-winning [[Tom Jones (1963 film)|1963 film]].<ref>{{cite magazine| work= [[Life (magazine)|Life]] |title= They can always go home to MAM| date= 18 September 1970 | page= [https://books.google.com/books?id=8lUEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA54&hl=en&sa=X&ei=-ICLUK2LFKrMmAWW1IHQDw&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=&f=false 54]| volume= 69| number= 12 |quote= Mills promptly changed the singer's name to Tom Jones, to exploit the popularity of the current film by that name, and for six months he and Tom and the accompanists lived off a loan Mills talked a bank into giving them.}}</ref>\n\nEventually, Mills got Jones a recording contract with [[Decca Records|Decca]]. His first single, \"Chills and Fever\", was released in late 1964. It did not chart, but the follow-up, \"[[It's Not Unusual]]\", became an international [[chart-topper|hit]] after offshore [[pirate radio]] station [[Radio Caroline]] promoted it. The following year was the most prominent of Jones's career, making him one of the most popular vocalists of the [[British Invasion]]. In early 1965, \"It's Not Unusual\" reached No. 1 in the United Kingdom and the top ten in the United States. During 1965, Mills secured a number of film themes for Jones to record, including the theme songs for the film ''[[What's New Pussycat?]]'' (written by [[Burt Bacharach]] and [[Hal David]]) and also for the [[James Bond]] film ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]''.<ref name=\"BioPart3\"/> Jones was also awarded the [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist]] in 1966.<ref name=\"Grammy\">{{cite magazine| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5SgEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA13&dq=tom+jones+grammy+award+best+new+artist&hl=en&sa=X&ei=dYaBT4GRLqWi0QXsqK2LBw&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=tom%20jones%20grammy%20award%20best%20new%20artist&f=false |title= Naras Champions of 1965| page= 12| work= Billboard | date= 26 March 1966| access-date= 8 April 2012}}</ref> In Hollywood, Jones met [[Elvis Presley]] for the first time; he recalls Presley singing his song as he walked towards him on set.\n\nIn 1966, Jones's popularity began to slip somewhat, causing Mills to reshape the singer's image into that of a [[crooner]]. Jones also began to sing material that appealed to a wider audience, such as the country hit \"[[Green, Green Grass of Home]]\". The strategy worked, and Jones returned to the top of the charts in the UK and began hitting the Top 40 again in the US. For the remainder of the decade, he scored a string of hits on both sides of the Atlantic, including \"[[I'll Never Fall in Love Again (Lonnie Donegan song)|I'll Never Fall in Love Again]]\", \"I'm Coming Home\", and \"Delilah\", each of which reached No. 2 in the UK chart.<ref name=\"Tom Jones Nostalgia Central\">{{cite web| url= http://www.nostalgiacentral.com/music/tomjones.htm | title= Tom Jones| website= nostalgiacentral.com |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060721100011/http://www.nostalgiacentral.com/music/tomjones.htm |archivedate= 21 July 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.classicbands.com/tomjones.html |title=Tom Jones |website=Classicbands.com |accessdate=12 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Las Vegas===\nIn 1967, Jones performed in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] for the first time, at the [[Flamingo Las Vegas|Flamingo]].<ref name=\"BioPart3\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/music/sites/tom-jones/pages/biography_03.shtml |title=Music \u2013 Tom Jones \u2013 Tom Jones biography \u2013 part three |website=BBC Wales |accessdate=12 October 2015}}</ref> His performances and style of dress became part of his stage act, and increasingly featured his open, half-unbuttoned shirts and tight trousers.

The following year was the most prominent of Jones's career, making him one of the most popular vocalists of the [[British Invasion]]. In early 1965, \"It's Not Unusual\" reached No. 1 in the United Kingdom and the top ten in the United States. During 1965, Mills secured a number of film themes for Jones to record, including the theme songs for the film ''[[What's New Pussycat?]]'' (written by [[Burt Bacharach]] and [[Hal David]]) and also for the [[James Bond]] film ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]''.<ref name=\"BioPart3\"/> Jones was also awarded the [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist]] in 1966.<ref name=\"Grammy\">{{cite magazine| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5SgEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA13&dq=tom+jones+grammy+award+best+new+artist&hl=en&sa=X&ei=dYaBT4GRLqWi0QXsqK2LBw&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=tom%20jones%20grammy%20award%20best%20new%20artist&f=false |title= Naras Champions of 1965| page= 12| work= Billboard | date= 26 March 1966| access-date= 8 April 2012}}</ref> In Hollywood, Jones met [[Elvis Presley]] for the first time; he recalls Presley singing his song as he walked towards him on set.\n\nIn 1966, Jones's popularity began to slip somewhat, causing Mills to reshape the singer's image into that of a [[crooner]]. Jones also began to sing material that appealed to a wider audience, such as the country hit \"[[Green, Green Grass of Home]]\". The strategy worked, and Jones returned to the top of the charts in the UK and began hitting the Top 40 again in the US. For the remainder of the decade, he scored a string of hits on both sides of the Atlantic, including \"[[I'll Never Fall in Love Again (Lonnie Donegan song)|I'll Never Fall in Love Again]]\", \"I'm Coming Home\", and \"Delilah\", each of which reached No. 2 in the UK chart.<ref name=\"Tom Jones Nostalgia Central\">{{cite web| url= http://www.nostalgiacentral.com/music/tomjones.htm | title= Tom Jones| website= nostalgiacentral.com |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060721100011/http://www.nostalgiacentral.com/music/tomjones.htm |archivedate= 21 July 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.classicbands.com/tomjones.html |title=Tom Jones |website=Classicbands.com |accessdate=12 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Las Vegas===\nIn 1967, Jones performed in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] for the first time, at the [[Flamingo Las Vegas|Flamingo]].<ref name=\"BioPart3\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/music/sites/tom-jones/pages/biography_03.shtml |title=Music \u2013 Tom Jones \u2013 Tom Jones biography \u2013 part three |website=BBC Wales |accessdate=12 October 2015}}</ref> His performances and style of dress became part of his stage act, and increasingly featured his open, half-unbuttoned shirts and tight trousers.
