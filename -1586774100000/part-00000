From painting, attributed to either [[Greg\u00f3rio Lopes]] or [[Cornelis Antoniszoon]], showing voyage of the marriage party of Portuguese [[Beatrice of Portugal, Duchess of Savoy|Infanta Beatriz]] to Savoy, 1521]]\nThe '''Portuguese India Armadas''' (''Armadas da \u00cdndia'') were the fleets of ships, organized by the crown of the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] and dispatched on an annual basis from [[Portugal]] to [[India]], principally [[Goa]]. These armadas undertook the '''''Carreira da \u00cdndia''''' (\"India Run\"), following the sea route around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] first opened up by [[Vasco da Gama]] in 1497\u20131499.\n\n==The India run==\nFor a long time after its discovery by Vasco da Gama, the sea route to India via the [[Cape of Good Hope]] was dominated by the Portuguese India armada \u2013 the annual fleet dispatched from Portugal to India. Between 1497 and 1650, there were 1033 departures of ships at [[Lisbon]] for the ''Carreira da \u00cdndia'' (\"India Run\").<ref>Guinote, P.J.A. (1999) \"Ascens\u00e3o e Decl\u00ednio da Carreira da \u00cdndia\", ''Vasco da Gama e a \u00cdndia, Lisboa: Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Calouste Gulbenkian'', 1999, vol. II, pp. 7\u201339.</ref>\n\n===Timing===\n[[File:Gama route 1.svg|300px|thumb|The route of Vasco da Gama's first voyage (1497\u20131499), what became the typical ''Carreira da \u00cdndia'']]\nThe India armada typically left [[Lisbon]] and each leg of the voyage took approximately six months.<ref>Godinho (1963: v. 3, pp. 44\u201345).</ref><ref group=\"N\">Duarte Pacheco Pereira (1509) strongly recommended February as the ideal departure month. Godinho (1963: v. 3, pp. 43\u201344) calculates that 87% of departures left in March or April, and the 13% outside that range were usually destined for elsewhere (Africa, Arabia).</ref> The critical determinant of the timing was the [[monsoon]] winds of the [[Indian Ocean]]. The monsoon was a southwesterly wind (i.e. blew from East Africa to India) in the summer (between May and September) and then abruptly reversed itself and became a northeasterly (from India to Africa) in the winter (between October and April). The ideal timing was to pass the [[Cape of Good Hope]] around June\u2013July and get to the [[East Africa]]n middle coast by August, just in time to catch the summer monsoon winds to India, arriving around early September. The return trip from India would typically begin in January, taking the winter monsoon back to Lisbon along a similar route, arriving by the summer (June\u2013August). Overall, the round trip took a little over a year, minimizing the time at sea.\n\nThe critical step was ensuring the armada reached East Africa on time. Ships that failed to reach the [[equator]] latitude on the East African coast by late August would be stuck in Africa and have to wait until next Spring to undertake an Indian Ocean crossing. And then they would have to wait in India until the Winter to begin their return. So any delay in East Africa during those critical few weeks of August could end up adding an entire extra year to a ship's journey.<ref group = \"N\">Godinho (1963: v. 3, p. 44) calculates that around 11% of outgoing ships missed the monsoon and ended up having to winter in East Africa.</ref>\n\nThe circumnavigation of [[Madagascar]] opened an alternative route to get to India, which gave more flexibility in timing. The rule that quickly emerged was that if an outbound armada doubled the Cape of Good Hope before mid-July, then it should follow the old \"inner route\" \u2013 that is, sail into the [[Mozambique Channel]], up the East African coast until the equator latitude (around [[Malindi]], [[Seychelles]]), then take the southwesterly monsoon across the ocean to India. If, however, the armada doubled the Cape after mid-July, then it was obliged to sail the \"outer route\" \u2013 that is, strike out straight east from South Africa, go under the southern tip of Madagascar, and then turn up from there, taking a northerly path through the [[Mascarenes]] islands, across the open ocean to India. While the outer route did not have the support of African staging posts and important watering stops, it sidestepped sailing directly against the post-summer monsoon.<ref>Matthew (1988: 233); Pimentel (1746: pp. 385\u2013386)</ref>\n[[File:Goa-Vasco 03-2016 02 Vaddem.jpg|thumb|left|180px|A brief view of the [[India]]n city of [[Vasco da Gama, Goa|Vasco da Gama]]]]\nReturn fleets were a different story.  The principal worry of the return fleets was the fast dangerous waters of the inner Mozambican channel, which was particularly precarious for heavily loaded and less maneuverable ships.  In the initial decades, the return fleet usually set out from [[Cochin]] in December, although that was eventually pushed forward to January.  January 20 was the critical date, after which all return fleets were obliged to follow the outer route (east of Madagascar) which was deemed calmer and safer for their precious cargo.<ref>Godinho (1963: v. 3, p. 45)</ref>  That meant they missed the important watering stop on Mozambique island on the return leg and had to put in elsewhere later, such as [[Mossel Bay]] or [[St. Helena]].  Between 1525 and 1579, ''all'' return fleets were ordered to follow the outer route. This rule was temporarily suspended between the 1570s and 1590s. From 1615, a new rule was introduced whereby return fleets from [[Goa]] were allowed to use the inner route, but return fleets from Cochin still had to use the outer route.<ref>Matthew (1988: 233)</ref>  With the entry of Dutch and English competition in the 1590s, the start of the return legs were delayed until February and March, with the predictable upsurge in lost and weather-delayed ships.<ref name=\"Godinho 1963, v.3:p.46\">Godinho (1963: v. 3, p. 46)</ref>\n\nArrival times in Portugal varied, usually between mid-June and late August.  It was customary for return fleets to send their fastest ship ahead to announce the results in Lisbon, before the rest of the fleet arrived later that summer.<ref name=\"Godinho 1963, v.3:p.46\"/>\n\nBecause of the timing, an armada had to leave Lisbon (February\u2013April) before the previous year's armada returned (June\u2013August). To get news of the latest developments in India, the outgoing armada relied on notes and reports left along the way at various African staging posts by the returning fleet.\n\n===Outward voyage===\n\nPortuguese India armadas tended to follow the same outward route.  There were several staging posts along the route of India Run that were repeatedly used.<ref group=\"N\">For old ''[[Rutter (nautical)|roteiro]]''s of the India Run, see [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] (1509), [[Jo\u00e3o de Lisboa]] (1519: pp. 69ff) and Manuel Pimentel (1746: pp. 381ff)</ref>\n\nSetting out from [[Lisbon]] (February\u2013April), India-bound [[naus]] took the easy [[Canary Current]] straight southwest to the [[Canary Islands]]. The islands were owned by [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and so this was not a usual watering stop for the Portuguese India naus, except in emergencies.\n\nThe first real obstacle on the route was the [[Cap-Vert|Cape Verde]] peninsula (Cap-Vert, [[Senegal]]), around which the Canary Current ends and the equatorial drift begins. Although not difficult to double, it was a concentration point of sudden storms and [[Cape Verde-type hurricane|tropical cyclones]], so ships were frequently damaged. (see [[Cape Verde-type hurricane]])\n\nThe [[Cape Verde islands]], to the west of Cape Verde peninsula was the usual first stop for India ships. Relative scarcity of water and supplies on the islands made this a suboptimal stop. Nonetheless, the islands (esp. [[Santiago, Cape Verde|Santiago]]) served as a harbor against storms and was frequently a pre-arranged point for the collection and repair of tempest-tossed ships.\n\nThe ''Angra de Bezeguiche'' (Bay of [[Dakar]], Senegal) was a common watering stop for ships after doubling Cape Verde. The shores were controlled by [[Wolof people|Wolof]] and [[Serer people|Serer]] kingdoms, whose relations with the Portuguese were ambivalent, so a warm reception on the mainland could not always be counted on. In the middle of the bay was the island of [[Gor\u00e9e]] (''ilha de Bezeguiche''), a safe anchoring spot, but the island itself lacked drinkable water. As a result, ships frequently watered and repaired at certain mainland points along the [[Petite C\u00f4te]] of Senegal shore such as ''Rio Fresco'' (now [[Rufisque]]) and ''Porto de Ale'' (now  [[Saly|Saly-Portudal]]). It was not unheard of for India naus to water much further south, e.g. among the many inlets and islands (e.g. [[Bissagos Islands|Bissagos]]) along the African coast to ''Serra Leoa'' ([[Sierra Leone]]).\n\nBelow Cape Verde, around the latitudes of Sierra Leone, begin the Atlantic [[doldrums]] \u2013 that is a calm low pressure region on either side of the equator with little or no winds.  At this time of year, the doldrums belt usually ranged between 5\u00b0 N and 5\u00b0 S. <ref group=\"N\">The exact latitude where the doldrums lay varies because of the \"Atlantic mini-monsoon\" phenomenon, i.e. during the summer months, the heating of West African mainland pulls winds up from the equator, thereby shunting the doldrums belt further north.</ref>  In the southern hemisphere, below the doldrums, was the counter-clockwise [[Ocean gyre|gyre]] of the [[South Atlantic Gyre|South Atlantic]] and the southeasterly [[trade wind]]s, which prevented sailing directly southeast to the Cape.\n\nPassing the doldrums was a navigational challenge, and pilots had to avail themselves deftly of the currents and every little breeze they could get to stay on course. The usual tactic was to proceed south or even southeast along the West African coast as long as possible, until the doldrums hit (usually around Sierra Leone), then to strike southwest sharply, drift over the doldrums and then catch the [[South Equatorial Current]] (top arm of the South Atlantic gyre) towards the coast of [[Brazil]]. This was usually referred to as following the ''[[volta do mar]]'' (literally, 'turn of the sea', i.e. the South Atlantic gyre).\n\n[[File:Map of Portuguese Carreira da India.gif|450px|thumb|Outward and return voyages of the Portuguese India run (''Carreira da \u00cdndia'')]]\n[The ''volta do mar'' was usually contrasted to the ''rota da Mina'' (Mina route). The latter meant striking ''southeast'' in the doldrums to catch the  [[Equatorial Counter Current]] (or 'Guinea Current') east into the [[Gulf of Guinea]]. This was the usual route to the fort of [[Elmina|S\u00e3o Jorge da Mina]] on the [[Portuguese Gold Coast]]. This was ''not'' part of the India run.  The route from Mina down to South Africa involved [[tacking (sailing)|tacking]] ''against'' the southeasterly trade winds and the contrary [[Benguela Current]], a particularly tiresome task for heavy [[square rig]]ged [[carrack]]s. However, it sometimes happened that by poor piloting, India naus would be inadvertently caught by the Guinea counter-current and forced to take that route, but such ships would not be likely to reach India that year.]<ref group=\"N\">The ''rota da Mina'' had been the usual route used by all Portuguese explorers to Africa until the end of the 15th century. The first fleet to sail the ''volta do mar'' was [[Vasco da Gama]]'s first fleet in 1497. However, credit for the discovery of the 'volta do mar' as a route to the Cape ought to be given to [[Bartolomeu Dias]], who in 1488\u201389, first discovered the [[westerlies]] below the 30\u00b0S and the [[South Atlantic Current]], from which was deduced the probable existence of the quicker and easier ''volta do mar'' route to the Cape. See Coutinho (1951\u20135: 319\u201363) and Waters (1988)</ref>\n\nAssuming the India armada successfully caught the south equatorial current of the ''volta do mar'', the armada would drift southwest through the doldrums and reach the southbound [[Brazil Current]] off the coast of Brazil (around [[Pernambuco]]). Although India naus did not usually stop in Brazil, it was not unheard of to put in a brief watering stop at [[Cabo de Santo Agostinho|Cape Santo Agostinho]] (Pernambuco, Brazil), especially if the southeasterly trade winds were particularly strong (pilots had to be careful not to allow themselves to be caught and driven backwards).\n\nFrom the environs of Pernambuco, the India [[naus]] sailed straight south along the Brazil Current, until about the latitude of the [[Tropic of Capricorn]], visibly the [[Abrolhos Archipelago|Abrolhos]] islands or the [[Trindade and Martim Vaz]] islands, where they began to catch more favorable prevailing [[westerlies]]. These would take them quickly straight east, across the South Atlantic, to South Africa.\n\nThe [[Cape of Good Hope]] \u2013 once aptly named the 'cape of storms' \u2013 was a very challenging headland on the India Run. The outbound crossing was always difficult, and many a ship was lost here. Larger armadas often broke up into smaller squadrons to attempt the crossing, and would re-collect only on the other side \u2013 indeed quite far on the other side. There was usually no stop or collection point after the Cape crossing until well inside the [[Mozambique Channel]]. The reason for this is that outbound ships tried to steer clear from the South African coast, to avoid the rushing waters of the contrary [[Agulhas Current]].\n\nThe exception was the ''Agoada de S\u00e3o Br\u00e1s'' ([[Mossel Bay]], South Africa), a watering stop after the Cape. It was not always used on the outbound journey since individual ships often charted wide routes around the Cape, and sighted coast again only well after this point. However, ships damaged during the crossing frequently had no choice but to put in there for emergency repairs. Trade for food supplies with the pastoral [[Khoikhoi]] peoples that lived in the area was frequent (although there were also occasional skirmishes). S\u00e3o Br\u00e1s was a more frequent stop on the return journey, as a place to repair the ships before doubling the Cape the other way. As a result, particularly in early years, S\u00e3o Br\u00e1s was used as a postal station, where messages from the returning armadas would be left for the outward armadas, reporting on the latest conditions in India.\n\n[[File:Bonne - Afrique, cote orientale.jpg|thumb|300px| French map of [[Mozambique Channel]], c. 1791]]\n\nIf the armada went by the 'inner route', then the next daunting obstacle was [[Cape Correntes]], at the entrance of the Mozambique Channel. Treacherously fast waters, light winds alternating with unpredictably violent gusts, and dangerous shoals and rocks made this cape particularly dangerous. It is estimated that of all the ships lost on the India run, nearly 30% of them capsized or ran aground around here - more than any other place.<ref>Guinote (1999). The dangers of the 'inner route' through the Mozambique channel are summarized in many old sailing rutters, e.g. Pimentel (1746: pp. 386ff), Hornsborough (1852, p. 211), Findlay (1866: 115).</ref>\n\nThe ideal passage through the Mozambique Channel would be to sail straight north through the middle of the channel, where a steady favorable wind could be relied upon at this season. But this was a particularly hard task in an era where [[longitude]] was determined largely by [[dead reckoning]]. If a pilot miscalculated and charted a course too close to the African coast, the current ran south, the winds were light or non-existent, subject to arbitrary gusts from strange directions and the coasts littered with [[shoals]].<ref group=\"N\">Indeed, another reason ships steered clear away from the South African coast after crossing the Cape of Good Hope was precisely that the contrary [[Agulhas current]] threw off the dead reckoning calculations, and often misled pilots into turning too soon into the Mozambique channel, forcing them on a dangerous too-western route up the channel.</ref>  Into this dreaded mix, Cape Correntes added its own special terror to the experience. The Cape was not only a confluence point of opposing winds, creating unpredictable whirlwinds, it also produced a strange and extraordinarily fast southerly current, violent enough to break a badly-sewn ship, and confusing enough to throw all reckoning out the window and lure pilots into grievous errors.\n\nThe temptation would be to err in the opposite direction, and keep on pushing east until the island of [[Madagascar]] was sighted, then move up the channel (the current here ran north), keeping the Madagascar coast in sight at all times. Although a Madagascar-hugging route cleared up the longitude problem, it was also abundant in fearful obstacles \u2013 coral islets, atolls, shoals, protruding rocks, submerged reefs, made for a particularly nerve-wracking experience to navigate, especially at night or in bad weather.\n\nTo avoid the worst consequences of doubling Cape Correntes, India ships stayed as far from the African coast as possible but not so close to Madagascar to run into its traps. To find the ideal middle route through the channel, pilots tended to rely on two dangerous longitude markers \u2013 the [[Bassas da India]] and the [[Europa Island|Europa rocks]].<ref>Pimentel (1746: 385\u2013386)</ref>  Although conveniently situated in the middle of the channel, they were not always visible above the waves, so sailors often watched for hovering clusters of [[seabird]]s, which colonized these rocks, as an indicator of their location.  Unfortunately, this was not a reliable method, and many an India ship ended up crashing on those rocks.\n\nIf they succeeded sailing up the middle channel, the India naus usually saw African coast again only around the bend of [[Angoche]]. If the ships were in a bad shape, they could stop at the [[Primeiras and Segundas Archipelago|Primeiras Islands]] (off Angoche) for urgent repairs. The Primeiras are a long row of uninhabited low coral islets \u2013 not much more than mounds above the waves \u2013 but they form a channel of calm waters between themselves and the mainland, a useful shelter for troubled ships.\n\n[[File:Ilha de Mo\u00e7ambique.jpg|thumb|250px| left|[[Mozambique Island]], with [[Fort S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o]] in background]]\nThe scheduled stop was a little further north on [[Mozambique Island]], a coral island off the coast, with two outlying smaller islands (''S\u00e3o Jorge'' and ''Sant' Iago''). Mozambique's main attribute was its splendid harbor, that served as the usual first stop and collection point of Portuguese India armadas after the crossing of the Cape of Good Hope. The island had a town and a fortress, so some stock of supplies was usually at hand.\n\nThe conditions of the ships by the time they reached Mozambique was often quite woeful. Notice that with the occasional exception of Cape Santo Agostinho and Mossel Bay, there are no stops between Cape Verde and Mozambique Island, an extraordinarily long time for 16th-century ships to remain at sea without repairs, watering or resupply. Already before the Cape, provisions had grown stale, [[scurvy]] and [[dysentery]] had often set in, and deaths of crews and passengers from disease had begun. The ship itself, so long at sea without [[Caulking#Wooden shipbuilding|re-caulking]] or re-painting, was in a fragile state. To then force the miserable ship through the mast-cracking tempests of Cape of Good Hope, the seam-ripping violent waters of Cape Correntes and the treacherous rocks of the channel, turned this final stage into a veritable hell for all aboard.<ref>Diffie and Winius (p. 201)</ref>\n\nMozambique Island was originally an outpost of the [[Kilwa Sultanate]], a collection of Muslim [[Swahili people|Swahili]] cities along the East African coast, centered at [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]], that formed a Medieval commercial empire from Cape Correntes in the south to the Somali borderlands in the north, what is sometimes called the \"[[Swahili Coast]]\". The Kilwa Sultanate began disintegrating into independent city-states around the time of the Portuguese arrival (1500), a process speeded along by the intrigues and interventions of Portuguese captains.\n\nThe original object of Portuguese attentions had been the southerly Swahili city of [[Sofala]], the main outlet of the [[Monomatapa]] gold trade, and the first Portuguese fortress in East Africa was erected there in 1505 ([[Fort S\u00e3o Caetano]] de Sofala).  But Sofala's harbor was marred by a long moving sandbank and hazardous shoals, making it quite unsuitable as a stop for the India armadas.  So in 1507, the 9th Portuguese India Armada (Mello, 1507) seized Mozambique Island and erected a fortress there (Fort S\u00e3o Gabriel, later replaced by [[Fort S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o]] in 1558), to use its spacious and well-sheltered harbor.\n\n[[File:East Africa, c.1500.jpg|thumb|300px| Principal cities of the [[Swahili Coast]] of East Africa, c. 1500.]]\nThe principal drawback was that Mozambique Island was parched and infertile. It produced practically nothing locally, it even had to ferry drinkable water by boat from elsewhere.<ref>Theal (1902, p. 118)</ref>  Replenishing the islands was not a simple matter. Although Mozambique islanders had established watering holes, gardens and coconut palm groves (essential for timber) just across on the mainland (at ''Cabaceira'' inlet), the [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] inhabitants of the area were generally hostile to both the Swahili and the Portuguese, and often prevented the collection of supplies.<ref>Theal (1902, p. 118). The hostility of the Bantus of Cabaceira may be related to old slave-raiding in the area.</ref>   So ensuring Mozambique had sufficient supplies presented its own challenges. The Portuguese [[Factor (agent)|factor]]s in Mozambique had to ensure enough supplies were shipped in from other points on the East African coast to Mozambique Island before the armada's scheduled arrival. The Mozambican factor also collected East African trade goods that could be picked up by the armadas and sold profitably in Indian markets \u2013 notably [[gold]], [[ivory]], [[copper]], [[pearl]]s and [[coral]].\n\nAfter Mozambique, the rule for the India armadas was generally to continue sailing north until they reached the [[equator]] latitude (the [[Seychelles]] islands, at 4\u00baS, were a common reference point). It was around here that the all-important southwesterly [[monsoon]] winds began to pick up. The armada would then just sail east, and let the monsoon carry them headlong across the Indian Ocean until India. That is presuming the armada arrived at the equator sometime in August.\n\nIn Pimentel's (1746) estimation, ships ''must'' leave Mozambique before August 25 to avail themselves of the summer monsoon. If, however, the armada arrived in the latter part of the season, say September, turning at the equator was a risky route. The southwesterly monsoon may be blowing in the right direction at the moment, but the ship ran the risk of not reaching a safe Indian port before the monsoon reversed direction (usually around late September to early October, when it became a northeasterly). So a late season ship was usually stuck in Africa until next April.\n\nNotice that the trajectory, as described, skips over nearly all the towns on the East African coast north of Mozambique \u2013 [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]] (''Qu\u00edloa''), [[Zanzibar]], [[Mombasa]] (''Momba\u00e7a''), [[Malindi]] (''Melinde''), [[Barawa]] (''Brava''), [[Mogadishu]] (''Magadoxo''), etc. This is not to say Portuguese did not visit those locations \u2013 indeed, some even had Portuguese factories and forts (e.g. Fort Santiago in Kilwa, held from 1505 to 1512). But Portuguese armadas on their way to India did not have to stop at those locations, and so usually did not. The stop on Mozambique island was usually the only necessary one.\n\n[[File:Pillar of Vasco da Gama.jpg|thumb|250px| left|[[Padr\u00e3o]] of [[Vasco da Gama]], at [[Malindi]], Kenya.]]\nNonetheless, if it had time, or got into trouble for some reason, the stopping choice was [[Malindi]]. A Portuguese ally from the earliest trip of Vasco da Gama in 1498, Malindi could usually be counted on to give a warm reception and had plenty of supplies. Unlike most other Swahili towns, Malindi was on the mainland and had an ample hinterlands with fertile cultivated fields, including groves of oranges and lemons (critical to [[Ascorbic acid|combat scurvy]]). The problem was that Malindi didn't really have a suitable harbor. Although waters were kept calm by an offshore reef, the anchorage area was littered with shoals. It did, however, have a peculiar protruding rock that served as a decent natural [[pier]] for loading and unloading goods.<ref>Theal (1902, p. 115)</ref>\n\nMalindi's other advantage was that, at 3\u00ba15'S, it was practically at exactly the right latitude to catch the southwesterly monsoon for an Indian Ocean crossing. Plenty of experienced Indian Ocean pilots \u2013 Swahili, Arab or Gujurati \u2013 could be found in the city, and Malindi was likely to have the latest news from across the sea.  So it was a very convenient stop for the Portuguese before a crossing.  However, stops take time. Given the imminent monsoon reversal, that was a scarce commodity. So if the armada had been decently equipped enough at Mozambique island, a stop at Malindi, however delightful or useful, was a rather unnecessary and risky expenditure of time.\n\nWith the monsoon, Portuguese India armadas usually arrived in India in early September (sometimes late August).  Because of the wind pattern, they usually made landfall around [[Anjediva]] island (''Angediva'').  From there, the armada furled their square sails and proceed with lateen sails south along the [[Malabar Coast|Malabar]] coast of India to the city of [[Cochin]] (''Cochim'', Kochi) in [[Kerala]].  Cochin was the principal spice port accessible to the Portuguese, it had the earliest Portuguese factory and fort in India, and served as the headquarters of Portuguese government and operations in India for the first decades.  However, this changed after the [[Portuguese conquest of Goa]] in 1510.  The capture of Goa had been largely motivated by the desire to find a replacement for Anjediva as the first anchoring point for the armadas.  Anjediva had proven itself to be far from ideal.  The island was generally undersupplied \u2013 it contained only a few fishing villages \u2013 but the armada ships were often forced to sojourn there for long periods, usually for repair or to await for better winds to carry them down to Cochin.  Anjediva island also lay in precarious pirate-infested waters, on the warring frontier between Muslim Bijapur and Hindu Vijaynagar, which frequently threatened it. The same winds which carried the armada down to Cochin prevented Portuguese squads from Cochin racing up to rescue it.  The Portuguese had tried setting up a fort in Anjediva, but it was captured and dismantled by forces on behalf of Bijapur.  As a result, the Portuguese governor [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] decided the nearby island-city of [[Goa]] was preferable and forcibly seized it in 1510.  Thereafter Goa, with its better harbor and greater supply base, served as the first anchorage point of Portuguese armadas upon arriving in India.  Although Cochin, with its important spice markets, remained the ultimate destination, and was still the official Portuguese headquarters in India until the 1530s, Goa was more favorably located relative to Indian Ocean wind patterns and served as its military-naval center.  The docks of Goa were soon producing their own carracks for the India run back to Portugal and for runs to further points east.\n\n===Return voyage===\nThe return voyage was shorter than the outbound. The fleet left India in December, picking up the [[Monsoon#Northeast monsoon|northeast monsoon]] towards the African coast. Passing through the Mozambique Channel, the fleet kept close to land to avoid the westerlies and catch the [[Agulhas Current]] to round the Cape of Good Hope. Once in the Atlantic, it caught the southeast trade winds and sailed to the west of [[Ascension Island|Ascension]] and [[Saint Helena]] as far as the doldrums. The fleet then sailed almost straight north to the [[Azores]], where it caught the prevailing westerlies and sailed due west into Lisbon.<ref>Alexander Marchant, \"Colonial Brazil as a Way Station for the Portuguese India Fleets\", ''Geographical Review'', Vol. 31, No. 3 (1941), p. 463.</ref>\n\n==Logistics of the Armadas==\n\n===Organization===\n[[Image:Departure of fleet from Lisbon harbor.jpg|thumb|right|350px| Departure of fleet for the Indies from Lisbon harbor, by [[Theodor de Bry]], 1592]]\nThe size of the armada varied, from enormous fleets of twenty-something ships, to small fleets of only four or five.   This changed over time. In the first decade (1500\u20131510), when the Portuguese were establishing themselves in India, the armadas averaged around 15 ships per year. This declined to around 9\u201310 ships in 1510\u20131525. From 1526 to the 1540s, the armadas declined further to 7\u20138 ships per year, with a few exceptional cases of large armadas (e.g. 1533, 1537, 1547) brought about by military exigency, but also several years of exceptionally small fleets. In the second half of the 16th century, the Portuguese India armada stabilized at 5\u20136 ships annually, with very few exceptions (rose above seven only in 1551 & 1590 and below 4 only in 1594 and 1597).<ref name=\"Guinote 1999\">Guinote (1999)</ref>\n\nOrganization was principally in the hands of the ''[[Casa da \u00cdndia]]'', the royal trading house established around 1500 by King [[Manuel I of Portugal]]. The Casa was in charge of monitoring the crown monopoly on India trade \u2013 receiving goods, collecting [[Tariff#Customs duty|duties]], assembling, maintaining and scheduling the fleets, contracting private merchants, correspondence with the ''feitorias'' (overseas [[Factory (trading post)|factories]]), drafting documents and handling legal matters.\n\nSeparately from the ''Casa'', but working in coordination with it, was the ''Armaz\u00e9m das \u00cdndias'', the royal agency in charge of nautical outfitting, that oversaw the Lisbon docks and naval arsenal. The Armaz\u00e9m was responsible for the training of pilots and sailors, ship construction and repair, and the procurement and provision of naval equipment \u2013 sails, ropes, guns, instruments and, most importantly, maps. The ''piloto-mor'' ('chief pilot') of the Armaz\u00e9m, in charge of pilot-training, was, up until 1548, also the keeper of the ''[[Padr\u00e3o Real]]'', the secret royal master map, incorporating all the cartographic details reported by Portuguese captains and explorers, and upon which all official nautical charts were based. The screening and hiring of crews was the function of the ''provedor'' of the Armaz\u00e9m.\n\n[[File:City of Lisbon, 1572.jpg|left|thumb|Ribeira Palace in the foreground of this view of the city of [[Lisbon]], Portugal from [[Georg Braun]] and Frans Hogenberg's atlas ''[[Civitates orbis terrarum]]'', 1572]]\nFrom at least 1511 (perhaps earlier), the offices of the Casa da India were based in the ground floor of the royal [[Ribeira Palace]], by the [[Pra\u00e7a do Com\u00e9rcio|Terreiro do Pa\u00e7o]] in Lisbon, with the Armaz\u00e9m nearby. (Neither the Casa nor the Armazem should be confused with the ''[[Estado da \u00cdndia]]'', the Portuguese colonial government in India, which was separate and reported directly to the monarch.)\n\nShips could be and sometimes were owned and outfitted by private merchants, and these were incorporated into the India armada. However, the expenses of outfitting a ship were immense, and few native Portuguese merchants had the wherewithal to finance one, despite eager government encouragement. In the early India runs, there are several ships organized by private consortiums, often with foreign capital provided by wealthy Italian and German trading houses. This fluctuated over time, as the royal duties, costs of outfitting and rate of attrition and risk of loss on India runs were sometimes too high for private houses to bear. Private Portuguese merchants did, however, routinely contract for cargo, carried aboard crown ships for freight charges.\n\n[[Marine insurance]] was still underdeveloped, although the Portuguese had helped pioneer its development and its practice seemed already customary.<ref>De Souza (1977), Diffie & Winius (1977: pp. 38, 101.)</ref>  <ref group=\"N\">In May, 1293, King [[Denis of Portugal]] had established the ''Sociedade de Mercadores Portugueses'' (Society of Portuguese Merchants), with mutual help clauses that formed the kernel of marine insurance contracts, similar to those in practice in Italian ports such as [[Genoa]] and [[Pisa]]. In 1380 [[Ferdinand I of Portugal|Ferdinand I]] established a shipping company (''[[Companhia das Naus]]''), with a compulsory insurance scheme, whereby member-merchants (essentially all shipowners and merchants outfitting ships above 50t) to contribute a fixed rate of 2% of freight revenue as a premium to a central fund (''Bolsa de Seguros''), from which claim payouts would be redistributed. Around 1488, [[Pedro de Santar\u00e9m]] (''Petrus Santerna''), a Portuguese consul in Italy, wrote perhaps the first treatise, ''De assecurationibus'' (published 1552\u201353), outlining the theory and principles behind marine insurance. Around 1578, [[Henry, King of Portugal|Cardinal-King Henry]] established the ''Consulado'', a tribunal explicitly dedicated to decide marine insurance cases (initially suppressed by the [[Iberian Union]] of 1580, the tribunal was resurrected by [[Philip II of Spain]] in 1593, with the modification that a private marine insurance contract had to have the signature of a royal official (''comiss\u00e1rio de seguros''), to be valid in the law courts). This formed the framework for marine insurance in which the India Armadas operated.  Later developments include the establishment of an insurance house (''Casa de Seguros'')  as an organ of the ''Junta do Com\u00e9rcio Geral'' (Board of General Trade) by regent-prince [[Peter II of Portugal]] in 1668, subsequently replaced by the ''Mesa do Bem Comum do Com\u00e9rcio (''Board of Common Trade Welfare) in 1720. Around 1750, the [[Sebasti\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 de Carvalho e Melo, Marquis of Pombal|Marquis de Pombal]] persuaded the monarch to fold the older house into a new entity, the ''Real Junta do Com\u00e9rcio'' (Royal Board of Trade). (DeSouza, 1977).</ref>\n\n===Ships===\n\n[[File:Armada portugaise.jpg|thumb|250px|Carracks of the India Armada of 1507, from the ''Livro de Lisuarte de Abreu'']]\nThe ships of an India armada were typically [[carracks]] (''naus''), with sizes that grew over time. The first carracks were modest ships, rarely exceeding 100-tonnes, carrying only up to 40\u201360 men, e.g. the [[S\u00e3o Gabriel (ship)|''S\u00e3o Gabriel'']] of [[Vasco da Gama|Gama's]] 1497 fleet, one of the largest of the time, was only 120t. But this was quickly increased as the India run got underway. In the 1500 [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral|Cabral]] armada, the largest carracks, Cabral's flagship and the ''El-Rei'', are reported to have been somewhere between 240t and 300t. The ''[[Frol de la mar|Flor de la Mar]]'', built in 1502, was a 400t nau, while at least one of the naus of the [[Afonso de Albuquerque|Albuquerque]] armada of 1503 is reported to have been as large as 600t. The rapid doubling and tripling of the size of Portuguese carracks in a few years reflected the needs of the India runs. The rate of increase tapered off thereafter. For much of the remainder of the 16th century, the average carrack on the India run was probably around 400t.\n\nIn the 1550s, during the reign of [[John III of Portugal|John III]], a few 900t behemoths were built for India runs, in the hope that larger ships would provide [[economies of scale]]. The experiment turned out poorly. Not only was the cost of outfitting such a large ship disproportionately high, they proved unmaneouverable and unseaworthy, particularly in the treacherous waters of the [[Mozambique Channel]]. Three of the new behemoths were quickly lost on the southern African coast \u2013 the ''S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o'' (900t, built 1550, wrecked 1552), the ''S\u00e3o Bento'' (900t, built 1551, wrecked 1554) and the largest of them all, the ''Nossa Senhora da Gra\u00e7a'' (1,000t, built 1556, wrecked 1559).<ref>Matthew (1988: pp. 266\u2013268); Castro (2005: p. 58)</ref>\n\n[[Image:Rela\u00e7\u00e3o da muy notavel perda do Gale\u00e3o Grande S. Jo\u00e3o.jpg|thumb|left|180px| Wreck of the ''S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o'', a large 900t India carrack (or great galleon), off the coast of South Africa, 1552.]]These kind of losses prompted King [[Sebastian of Portugal|Sebastian]] to issue an ordinance in 1570 setting the upper limit to the size of India naus at 450t.<ref>Castro (2005: p. 58)</ref>  Nonetheless, after the [[Iberian Union]] of 1580, this regulation would be ignored and shipbuilders, probably urged on by merchants hoping to turn around more cargo on every trip, pushed for larger ships. The size of India naus accelerated again, averaging 600t in the 1580\u20131600 period, with several spectacularly large naus of 1500t or greater making their appearance in the 1590s.\n\nIf the lesson was not quite learned then, it was certainly learned in August, 1592, when English [[privateer]] [[Sir John Burroughs]] (alt. Burrows, Burgh) the ''[[Madre de Deus]]'' in the waters around the [[Azores]] islands (see [[Battle of Flores (1592)|Battle of Flores]]). The ''Madre de Deus'', built in 1589, was a 1600t carrack, with seven decks and a crew of around 600. It was the largest Portuguese ship to go on an India run. The great carrack, under the command of Fern\u00e3o de Mendon\u00e7a Furtado, was returning from [[Cochin]] with a full cargo when it was captured by Burrough. The value of the treasure and cargo taken on this single ship is estimated to have been equivalent to half the entire treasury of the English crown. The loss of so much cargo in one swoop confirmed, once again, the folly of building such gigantic ships.<ref>Castro, ibid; Kingsford (1912)</ref> The carracks built for the India run returned to their smaller ideal size after the turn of the century.<ref>Castro, ibid.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Caravela Vera Cruz a entrar no Porto de Pipas, festas S\u00e3o Joaninas, 2008, Angra do Hero\u00edsmo, ilha Terceira, A\u00e7ores.JPG|thumb|right|150px| Modern replica of a lateen-rigged [[caravel]]]]\nIn the early ''Carreira da India'', the carracks were usually accompanied by smaller [[caravels]] (''caravelas''), averaging 50t\u201370t (rarely reaching 100t), and capable of holding 20\u201330 men at most. Whether [[Lateen|lateen-rigged]] (''{{lang|pt|latina}}'') or [[square rig|square-rigged]] (''[[Square Rigged Caravel|redonda]]''), these shallow-drafted, nimble vessels had a myriad of uses. Caravels served as forward lamp, scouts and fighting ships of the convoy. Caravels on the India run were often destined to remain overseas for coastal patrol duty, rather than return with the main fleet.\n\nIn the course of the 16th century, caravels were gradually phased out in favor of a new escort/fighting ship, the [[galleon]] (''gale\u00e3o''), which could range anywhere between 100t and 1000t. Based on the design of the [[carrack]], but slenderer and lower, with forecastle diminished or removed to make way for its famous 'beak', the galleon became the principal fighting ship of the India fleet. It was not as nimble as the caravel, but could be mounted with much more cannon, thus packing a bigger punch. With the introduction of the galleon, carracks became almost exclusively cargo ships (which is why they were pushed to such large sizes), leaving any fighting to be done to the galleons. One of the largest and most famous of Portuguese galleons was the ''[[Botafogo (galleon)|S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Baptista]]'' (nicknamed ''Botafogo'', 'spitfire'), a 1,000-ton galleon built in 1534, said to have carried 366 guns.\n\nMany fleets also brought small supply ships on outward voyage. These were destined to be scuttled along the way once the supplies were consumed. The crews were redistributed and the abandoned ships usually burned to recover their iron nails and fittings.\n\nAverage speed of an India Armada was around 2.5 [[Knot (unit)|knots]], but some ships could achieve speeds of between 8 and 10 for some stretches.\n\n===Seaworthiness===\n\nPortuguese India ships distinguished themselves from the ships of other navies (especially those of rival powers in the Indian Ocean) on two principal accounts: their seaworthiness (durability at sea) and their artillery.\n\nWith a few exceptions (e.g. ''[[Frol de la mar|Flor de la Mar]]'', ''[[Santa Catarina do Monte Sinai]]''), Portuguese India naus were not typically built to last longer than four or five years of useful service.   That a nau managed to survive a single India run was already an achievement, given that few ships of any nation at the time were able to stay at sea for even a quarter as long without breaking apart at the seams.\n\nThe success of the India nau depended on 15th-century innovations in Portuguese shipbuilding that greatly improved the seaworthiness and longevity of the ship. Notable among these were the use of iron nails (rather than wooden pegs) to hold planks, the mixing of [[lead]] in the seams, and a [[caulking]] technique that improved upon traditional [[oakum]] with 'galagala' paste (a mixture of oakum, [[Lime (fruit)|lime]] and [[olive oil]], producing a kind of putty that could be pressed between the planks). Hulls were amply coated in [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]] and pine [[tar]] (imported in bulk amounts from northern Germany), giving the India naus their famous (and, to some observers, sinister) dark tone.<ref>see [[Black Ships]]</ref>\n\n===Artillery===\n[[File:Falconete Museu Marinha Lisboa.jpg|thumb|right|Portuguese breech-loading ''falconete'', reign of King Sebastian]]\n[[Naval artillery#Transition|Naval artillery]] was the single greatest advantage the Portuguese held over their rivals in the Indian Ocean \u2013 indeed over most other navies \u2013 and the Portuguese crown spared no expense in procuring and producing the best naval guns European technology permitted.\n\nKing [[John II of Portugal]], while still a prince in 1474, is often credited for pioneering the introduction of a reinforced deck on the old Henry-era [[caravel]] to allow the mounting of heavy guns.<ref>Rodrigues and Tevezes (2009: p. 193)</ref>  In 1489, he introduced the first standardized teams of trained naval gunners (''bombardeiros'') on every ship, and development of naval tactics that maximized broadside cannonades rather than the rush-and-grapple of Medieval [[galleys]].\n\nThe Portuguese crown appropriated the best cannon technology available in Europe, particularly the new, more durable and far more accurate [[bronze]] cannon developed in Central Europe, replacing the older, less accurate [[wrought-iron]] cannon. By 1500, Portugal was importing vast volumes of [[copper]] and cannon from northern Europe, and had established itself as the leading producer of advanced naval artillery in its own right. Being a crown industry, cost considerations did not curb the pursuit of the best quality, best innovations and best training.<ref>Rodrigues and Tevezes (2009: p. 263) emphasize its importance as a crown industry \u2013 the coincidence between the producer and consumer of the product. Portuguese naval artillery was rarely faulty or exploded from misuse, not only because of crown self-interest in quality during production, but also because defective domestic pieces (unlike imported ones) were easy to fix or replace locally.</ref> The crown paid wage premiums and bonuses to lure the best European artisans and gunners (mostly German) to advance the industry in Portugal. Every cutting-edge innovation introduced elsewhere was immediately appropriated into Portuguese naval artillery \u2013 that includes bronze cannon (Flemish/German), breech-loading swivel-guns (prob. German origin), truck carriages (possibly English), and the idea (originally French, c. 1501<ref>Cipolla (1965)</ref>) of cutting square [[gun port]]s (''portinhola'') in the hull to allow heavy cannon to be mounted below deck.<ref>Rodrigues and Tevezes (2009: pp. 260\u2013264)</ref>\n\nIn this respect, the Portuguese spearheaded the evolution of modern naval warfare, moving away from the Medieval warship, a carrier of armed men, aiming for the grapple, towards the modern idea of a floating artillery piece dedicated to resolving battles by gunnery alone.\n\nAccording to Gaspar Correia, the typical fighting caravel of Gama's [[4th Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1502)|4th Armada]] (1502) carried 30 men, four heavy guns below, six [[Falconet (cannon)|falconets]] (''falconete'') above (two fixed astern) and ten [[Swivel gun|swivel-guns]] (''canh\u00e3o de ber\u00e7o'') on the quarter-deck and bow.\n\nAn armed carrack, by contrast, had six heavy guns below, eight falconets above and several swivel-guns, and two fixed forward-firing guns before the mast.<ref>Correa, in Stanley, p. 367</ref>  Although an armed carrack carried more firepower than a caravel, it was much less swift and less manoeuvrable, especially when loaded with cargo. A carrack's guns were primarily defensive, or for shore bombardments, whenever their heavier firepower was necessary. But by and large, fighting at sea was usually left to the armed caravels. The development of the heavy galleon removed even the necessity of bringing carrack firepower to bear in most circumstances.\n\n===Losses===\n[[File:Nau de Rui Vaz Pereira levantada por um monstro marino, armada de 1520. Livro de Lisuarte de Abreu.jpg|thumb|right|Sea-monster depicted in the ''Livro de Lisarte de Abreu'']]\n\nAccording to historian Oliveira Martins, of the 806 naus sent on the India Run between 1497 and 1612, 425 returned safely to Portugal, 20 returned prematurely (i.e. without reaching India), 66 were lost, 4 were captured by the enemy, 6 were scuttled and burnt, and 285 remained in India (which went on to meet various fates of their own in the East.)\n\nThe loss rate was higher in certain periods than others, reflecting greater or lesser attention and standards of shipbuilding, organization, supervision, training, etc. which reveals itself in shoddily-built ships, overloaded cargo, incompetent officers, as well as the expected higher dangers of wartime. The rates fluctuated dramatically. By one estimate, in 1571\u20131575, 90% of India ships returned safely; by 1586\u20131590, the success rate fell to less than 40%; between 1596 and 1605, the rate climbed above 50% again, but in the subsequent years fell back to around 20%.<ref name=\"Guinote 1999\"/>\n\nThat only four ships on India runs were known to be captured by the enemy seems quite astonishing. These were:\n\n*(1) 1508, the ship of J\u00f3 Queimado, originally part of the 8th Portuguese India Armada (Cunha, 1506) of [[Trist\u00e3o da Cunha]] that set out in 1506. It was captured in 1508 by the French corsair Mondragon (said by one account to be in the [[Mozambique Channel]], but it is unlikely Mondragon would have taken the trouble of doubling the [[Cape of Good Hope|Cape]]; it was more likely captured on the Atlantic side, probably near the [[Azores]]). Mondragon was himself tracked down and taken prisoner by [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] in January, 1509, off [[Cape Finisterre]].\n*(2) 1525, ''[[Santa Catarina do Monte Sinai]]'', the great carrack built in [[Goa]] in 1512. It had been used to carry [[Vasco da Gama]] in 1523 to serve as the new [[List of colonial heads of Portuguese India|viceroy of India]], and was on its way back to Portugal in 1525, with the former governor D. [[Duarte de Menezes]], when it was taken by French corsairs. (However, some have speculated that there was no foreign attack, that Menezes himself simply decided to go [[pirate|piratical]] and took command of the ship.)\n*(3) 1587, ''S\u00e3o Filipe'', returning from an India run, was captured by English privateer Sir [[Francis Drake]], off [[the Azores]]. The triumph of the ''S\u00e3o Filipe'' cargo, one of the wealthiest hoards ever captured, was overshadowed only by the even wealthier trove of paperwork and maps detailing the Portuguese trade in Asia which fell into English hands. This set in motion the first English expedition to India, under Sir [[James Lancaster]] in 1591.\n*(4) 1592 ''Madre de Deus'', the gigantic carrack captured by [[Sir John Burroughs]] near the Azores, already described above.\n\nThis does not count, of course, ships that were attacked by enemy action and subsequently capsized or destroyed. It also does not count ships that were captured later in the East Indies (i.e. not on the India route at the time). The most famous of these was probably the mighty Portuguese carrack [[Santa Catarina (ship)|''Santa Catarina'']] (not to be confused with its earlier ''Mount Sinai'' namesake), captured in 1603, by Dutch captain [[Jacob van Heemskerk]]. The ''Santa Catarina'' was on a [[Portuguese Macau]] to [[Portuguese Malacca]] run with a substantial cargo of Sino-Japanese wares, most notably a small fortune in [[musk]], when it was captured by Heemskerk in [[Singapore]]. The captured cargo nearly doubled the capital of the fledgling [[Dutch East India Company|Dutch VOC]].\n\nShips losses should not be confused with crew losses from disease, deprivation, accident, combat and desertion. These tended to be horrifically high \u2013 one third, or even as much as one half, even in good years.\n\n===Crews===\n[[File:Portuguese Discoveries and Empire Flag.svg|thumb|right| The banner of the [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Order of Christ]] became a popular, and de facto, naval and war ensign amongst captains below the rank of Viceroy (who flew the royal banner), since many notable Portuguese captains belonged to that order.]]\nThe admiral of an armada, necessarily a nobleman of some degree, was known as the ''capit\u00e3o-mor'' (captain-major), with full jurisdiction over the fleet. There was also usually a designated ''soto-capit\u00e3o'' (vice-admiral), with a commission to assume command should tragedy befall the captain-major. The vice-admirals were also useful if a particular armada needed to be split into separate squadrons. If an armada carried a [[List of colonial heads of Portuguese India|viceroy or governor of the Indies]], he typically assumed the senior position (although in practice many delegated the decision-making during the journey to their flagship's captain).\n\nEach India ship had a ''capit\u00e3o'' ([[Captain (nautical)|captain]]). As the position of captain could be quite profitable, it became quite attractive to lesser nobles and men of ambition hoping for a quick and easy fortune.   The crown was often happy to 'sell' captain positions on India runs as a form of royal patronage to candidates with little or no experience at sea. Nonetheless, the captain was formally the king's representative and highest authority on his ship. Everyone, even noble passengers of greater formal rank, were under his jurisdiction. The supremacy of a captain's authority was curtailed only if the captain-major came aboard his ship, and when he docked in [[Goa]] (jurisdiction passed to the [[List of colonial heads of Portuguese India|Vice-Roy or Governor]]).\n\nAnother important figure on an India ship was the ''escriv\u00e3o'' ([[Captain's clerk|clerk]]), the ''de facto'' royal agent. The clerk was in charge of the written record of everything on the ship, especially the cargo inventory, which he tracked with meticulous precision. The clerk was carefully screened by the [[Casa da \u00cdndia]], and was the crown's most trusted agent on board ship, and expected to keep an eye for crown interests. This gave him, in practice, a greater authority on the ship than his formal title suggests. At departure, the clerk was presented with the keys to the ''por\u00e3o'' ([[Hold (ship)|hold]]) and a [[Seal (emblem)|royal signet]] to seal the cargo. Nobody, not even the captain, was allowed to visit the cargo hold without the clerk present. It is said that rations could not be distributed, nor even a cup of water drawn from a barrel, without notifying the clerk. Upon the capture of an enemy ship, the clerk was immediately escorted aboard the captured vessel to seal the holds, cabins and chests, and take inventory of the loot.\n\nTechnical command of the ship was in the hands of the ''piloto'' (who combined the roles of [[Maritime pilot|pilot]] and [[navigator]]) and his assistant, the ''soto-piloto'' (second or under-pilot). The pilot and his assistant not merely steered the ship, but were responsible for all navigational matters \u2013 charts, instruments, plotting the course, etc. As captains were often quite inexperienced, the pilot was usually the highest trained naval officer aboard. Captains frequently deferred to them on the running of the ship.\n\nLacking a formal navigation school, early pilots were trained by [[apprenticeship]]. New pilots received their instruction, both practical and theoretical,  first-hand from master pilots aboard ship and kept a tight lid on their professional secrets.<ref>In his ''Tratado que...fez em defens\u00e3o da carta de marear, Co' regimento de altura'' (1537), the ''comosgrafo-mor'' (chief cosmographer) [[Pedro Nunes]] chides the India pilots for their reluctance to instruct or seek instruction formally.</ref>  This changed in the late 1550s or early 1560s, with the establishment of formal courses of instruction for India pilots in Lisbon by the ''cosm\u00f3grafo-mor'' [[Pedro Nunes]], which included a final examination and formal certification.<ref>Although still holding his mathematics chair in [[University of Coimbra|Coimbra]] until 1562, Pedro Nunes began spending extended periods in Lisbon in the late 1550s.  Details of Pedro Nunes's 'navigation courses' are scanty.  It is believed the course was carried on after Nunes's death in 1578 by his successors Thomaz Orta and [[Jo\u00e3o Baptista Lavanha]].  See Sousa Viterbo (1897). Diffie and Winius (p. 142).</ref>\n\n[[File:Mariner's astrolabe.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The [[mariner's astrolabe]] was developed shortly before 1500 and found its first use in early Portuguese India Armadas]]\nDespite their general secretiveness, several early India pilots compiled written navigation manuals, probably initially merely as notes for themselves, but eventually passed on and copied by others.  These included general instructions on how to read, plot and follow routes by nautical chart, how to use the principal nautical instruments of the day \u2013 the  mariner's [[compass]], the [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]], the [[astrolabe]], the [[Nocturnal (instrument)|nocturlabe]] and the ''balestilha'' ([[cross-staff]]) \u2013 and astronomical tables (notably that of solar declination, derived from [[Abraham Zacuto]] and later Pedro Nunes's own) to correctly account for \"compass error\" (the deviation of the [[magnetic north]] from the [[true north]]) by recourse to the [[Pole Star]], [[Sun]] and [[Southern Cross]], the flux and reflux of [[tides]], etc.  These manuals often contained a ''roteiro'' ([[rutter (nautical)|rutter]]), giving the detailed instructions (by geographical coordinates and physical description) of the routes to India.  Two of the few which have survived were [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]]'s ''Esmeraldo de Situ Orbis'' (c. 1509) and  [[Jo\u00e3o de Lisboa]]'s ''Livro da Marinharia'' (c. 1514).<ref>Other famous rutters of the India run include those by [[Andr\u00e9 Pires]] (c. 1530), [[Diogo Afonso]] (c. 1536), [[Jo\u00e3o de Castro]] (1538\u20131541), [[Manuel de \u00c1lvares]] (1545), [[P\u00earo Vaz Fargosa]] (1560), [[Vicente Rodrigues]] (1575, 1591) and, perhaps most famous of all, the 1595 Dutch edition by [[Jan Huyghen van Linschoten]]. (Matthew, 1988)</ref>\n\nRelative to the ships of other nations (e.g. French, Dutch), clerks and pilots on Portuguese vessels held an unusually high degree of authority.\n\nNext in a ship's hierarchy was the ''mestre'' ([[Master (naval)|master]]). The ship's master was the officer in charge of all sailors, ship's boys and the rest of the crew. His primary job at sea was to ensure the crew implemented the technical manoeuvre orders of the pilot \u2013 raising and lowering sails, etc. As such, the master required a good degree of sailing knowledge \u2013 knowing how to translate the pilot's instructions into sail & crew instructions. He was often sufficiently trained in navigation to take over pilot's duties if the pilot and under-pilot were incapacitated. But a ship which lost all three officers would usually be in serious trouble.\n\n[[Image:Portuguese Nau.png|thumb|230px| Portuguese carrack]]\nAssisting the master, was the ''contramestre'' (or ''soto-mestre'', [[boatswain]]). The boatswain was the crew enforcer \u2013 he ensured the master's orders were implemented by the crew. In practice, they usually partitioned the deck between them, with the master in charge of implementation in the [[stern]], and the boatswain in the [[bow (ship)|bow]]. The boatswain was also in charge of the maintenance of rigging, anchors and supervising the loading and unloading of cargo, etc. The boatswain had his own assistant, the ''guardi\u00e3o'' (boatswain's mate).\n\nThe bulk of the crew were all-purpose sailors \u2013 usually half of them ''marinheiros'' (seamen), the other half ''grumetes'' (ship-boys). The partition between the two classes was akin to the modern distinction between [[able seaman]] and [[Ordinary Seaman (occupation)|ordinary seamen]], e.g. ship-boys were assigned the drudgery duties, swabbing and scrubbing, moving cargo, etc., while seamen would be given 'higher' responsibilities, e.g. assigned to hold the wheel on the ''tolda'' ([[quarterdeck]]). The boatswain was considered the head of the seamen, and served as the intermediary between the seamen and the higher officers (master, pilot, etc.). The boatswain's mate had authority only over the ship-boys; seamen would not obey a boatswain's mate's order.<ref>Hutter (2005: p. 180)</ref>\n\nThen there were the specialized crew. A Portuguese India nau usually had two ''estrinqueiros'', skilled sailors in charge of the [[windlass]] that operated the round [[Mast (sailing)|sails]] (one for the main mast, another for the fore mast). The ''meirinho'' ([[bailiff]]), a judicial officer, was in charge of dispensing punishment and supervising on-board dangers (fires, gunpowder stores, weapon caches). The ''capel\u00e3o'' ([[chaplain]]) was in charge of saving souls, the ''barbeiro'' ([[barber surgeon]]) in charge of saving lives. A large nau usually had a number of ''pagens'' ([[Page (occupation)|pages]]), who not only attended upon the officers and the cabins, but also served as runners delivering orders across the deck.\n\nThe ''despenseiro'' ([[purser]]/[[Chief Steward|steward]]) was in charge of food stores and rations. Unlike ships of other nations, Portuguese vessels did not usually have a cook aboard, sailors were expected to cook their own meals themselves at the ship's ovens.<ref>Hutter (2005: p. 177)</ref> Rations were composed primarily of [[ship biscuit]] (the main staple, rationed at 2&nbsp;lb per person per day). Other provisions included wine, salt, olive oil, salted cod, sardines, pork, cheese, rice, and the like, with fresh fruits and vegetables available on the initial part of the journey.  Rations were suspended if the ship was at dock and the men ashore. On the return journey, the crown would only supply enough biscuit and water for a ship to reach the Cape of Good Hope; the ship's crew would have to find its own provisions thereafter.<ref>Matthew, 1988: p. 250</ref>\n\nPerhaps the most valued of the specialized positions was the repair crew. This was usually composed of two ''carpinteiros'' ([[carpenter]]s ) and two ''calafate'' (caulkers) that fixed anything that was broken, plus the ''tanoeiro'' ([[Cooper (profession)|cooper]]), who ensured the cargo and water stores remained preserved. A nau might also have ''mergulhadores'' (divers), crew specially trained to go down the outside of the ship to check and help repair hull damage below the water level.\n\nMilitary personnel aboard a nau varied with the mission. Except for some specialists and passengers, most of the crew was armed before encounters and expected to fight. But every nau also had, at the very least, a small specialized [[Naval artillery|artillery]] crew of around ten ''bombardeiros'' (gunners), under the command of a ''condest\u00e1vel'' ([[constable]]). As naval artillery was the single most important advantage the Portuguese had over rival powers in the Indian Ocean, gunners were highly trained and enjoyed a bit of an elite status on the ship. (Indeed, many gunners on Portuguese India ships were highly skilled foreigners, principally Germans, lured into Portuguese service with premium wages and bonuses offered by crown agents.<ref>Rodrigues and Tevezes (2009: p. 263)</ref>)\n\nShips that expected more military encounters might also carry ''homens d'armas'' ([[Man-at-arms|men-at-arms]]), ''espingardeiros'' ([[arquebusier]]s/[[musketeer]]s) and ''besteiros'' ([[crossbowmen]]). But, except for the gunners, soldiers aboard ship were not regarded as an integral part of the naval crew, but rather just as passengers.\n\nThe following is a sample composition of a typical 16th-century Portuguese India nau ([[carrack]]):<ref>Castro (2005: p. 63)</ref>\n*1 captain (capit\u00e3o)\n*1 clerk (''escriv\u00e3o'')\n*1 chaplain (''capel\u00e3o'')\n*2 pilots (''piloto'', ''soto-piloto'')\n*1 master (''mestre'')\n*1 boatswain (''contramestre'')\n*1 boatswain's mate (''guardi\u00e3o'')\n*2 windlass operators (''estrinqueiros'')\n*45 seamen (''marinheiros'')\n*48 ship-boys (''grumetes'')\n*4 pages (''pagems'')\n*2 carpenters (''carpinteiro'' and ''carpinteiro sobressalente'')\n*2 caulkers (''calafate'' and ''calafate sobressalente'')\n*1 cooper (''tanoeiro'')\n*1 steward (''despenseiro'')\n*1 bailiff (''meirinho'')\n*1 barber-surgeon (''barbeiro'')\n*1 constable (''condest\u00e1vel'')\n*11 gunners (''bombardeiros'')\n\nTotal = 127 crew\n\nPlus any soldiers and passengers that might be taken aboard.\n\n===Compensation and spoils===\nIn addition to the cash salaries paid by the [[Casa da \u00cdndia]], captains and crew members were allowed to engage in trade on their own account (up to a certain amount). That is, they were authorized to import into Portugal a pre-specified volume of pepper and a certain number of boxes of assorted goods (''caixas forras de fretes e direitos'', or ''caixas de liberdades'', \"liberty chests\"). These were to be purchased in India out of their own pockets, of course, but the crown would allow these cargoes to be brought back on crown ships free of freight charge and duties, and sold in Lisbon markets (at pre-set prices), for their own personal profit.  Liberty chests had standard dimensions 4' \u00d7 3' \u00d7 2.5' <ref>Matthew, 1988: p. 247</ref>\n\n[[File:Jeronimos-SouthFacade.jpg|270px|thumb|The [[Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery]], built on the profits of the India armadas]]\nIn the early armadas, the captain-major and captains of the carracks were obliged, by King [[Manuel I of Portugal]], to pay the ''vintena de Bel\u00e9m'', a 5% duty of the earnings from the private sales of imported goods for the construction and maintenance of the [[Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery]] in [[Santa Maria de Bel\u00e9m|Bel\u00e9m]]. This rule was introduced in 1502 and continued until about 1522.\n\nThe following compensation schedule is taken from the [[2nd Portuguese India Armada (Cabral, 1500)|Second India Armada]] of 1500<ref>As reported in Gaspar Correia's ''Lendas da India'', p. 147; Matthew (1988: p. 247) gives a different breakdown</ref>\n\n* captain-major: 10,000 cruzados for entire journey, 500 [[quintal]]s of pepper, 10 liberty chests\n* captain: 1,000 cruzados for each 100-tonne ship size they command, 50 quintals, 6 chests\n* pilot, master: 500 cruzados, 30 quintals, 4 chests\n* constable: 200 cruzados, 10 quintals, 2 chests\n* gunners: 10 cruzados per month, 10 quintals, 1 chest\n* soldiers: 5 cruzados per month, 3 quintals, 1 chest\n* sailors: 10 cruzados per month, 10 quintals, 1 chest\n* boatswain & boatswain's mate: 1 and a 1/3 times the sailor's salary.\n* specialized crew (chaplain, steward, barber-surgeon, carpenter, caulker, windlass-operator): 2/3 of the sailor's salary\n* ship-boys: 1/2 of the sailor's salary\n* pages: 1/4 of the sailor's salary\n\nThe ''Casa da India'' allowed the captain-major to draw as much as 5,000 cruzados of his salary in advance, a captain 1,000. Any married crewman could draw up to one year in salary in advance, while a single man could draw up to six months.\n\nOfficers, soldiers and officials that were to remain in India in some capacity (patrol ship captains, factors, clerks, magistrates (''[[alcaide]]-mor''), etc.) typically signed employment contracts of three years duration. Soldiers who signed an overseas service contract received a bonus of 800 ''[[Portuguese real|reais]]'' per month en route, bumped up to 1200 per month in India (to pay for living expenses),<ref>1 cruzado was between 324 and 400 reais</ref> and the right to ship back an additional 2.5 quintals of pepper per year (in addition to the quintals they were already authorized to send back according to the standard pay scale).<ref>See Barros, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BJ42AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA193#v=onepage&q&f=false pp. 193\u2013194]</ref>\n\nEven if not formally authorized, captains sometimes supplemented their earnings by undertaking a bit of piracy and extortion on the side. Although it did not necessarily encourage India armadas to pursue activities that might endanger their ships and cargoes, rules were still set out for the partition of the spoils of captured ships and extortion of tribute from 'unfriendly' ports.\n\nThe rules of plunder were as follows: first of all, the captain-major has the 'right to a jewel', i.e. he is allowed to pick one item from the spoils for himself, provided it is worth no more than 500 cruzados. Then one-fifth is set aside for the crown. The remainder is subsequently divided into three parts: 2/3 for the crown again (albeit to be expended on the armada itself in the form of equipment, supplies and ammunition), and the remaining third distributed among the crew for private taking. The partition of this last third worked out as follows:<ref>Fonseca (1908: p. 201)</ref>\n\n*Captain-major: 15 parts\n*captains of the large carracks: 10 parts\n*Captains of caravels: 6 parts\n*Pilot-Master (i.e. those who served double office of pilot & master): 4 parts\n*Masters: 3 parts\n*Pilots: 3 parts\n*Sailors: 2 parts\n*Gunners: 2 parts\n*''Espingardeiros'' (arquebusiers/musketeers): 2 parts\n*Crossbowmen: 2 parts\n*Armed sailors: 1.5 parts\n*Men-at-arms: 1.5 parts\n*Ship boys: 1 part\n\nOnce again, the captain-major and captains of large carracks had to contribute 10% of their part to the [[Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery]] of Bel\u00e9m (although that does not seem to apply to the others).\n\n==The India Trade==\n\n===Cargo===\nWhile the India armadas were used to ferry troops, officials, missionaries and colonists between Europe and Asia, their primary objective was commercial. They were engaged in the spice trade, importing Asian spices to sell in European markets, especially the five \"glorious spices\" \u2013 pepper, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and mace.\n\n{|cellpadding=3 cellspacing=0 style=\"margin:5px; border:1px solid;\" | style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ '''The Glorious Spices'''\n|-\n|[[File:BlackPeppercorns.JPG|150px|[[Black pepper|Pepper]]]]||[[File:Canelle Cinnamomum burmannii Luc Viatour crop1.jpg|150px| [[Cinnamon]]]] || [[File:ClovesDried.jpg|150px|[[Clove]]]] || [[File:Muscade.jpg|150px|[[Nutmeg]]]] || [[File:Fleur de muscade.jpg|150px|[[Mace (spice)]]]]\n|-\n| [[Black Pepper|Pepper]] || [[Cinnamon]] || [[Cloves]] || [[Nutmeg]] || [[Mace (spice)|Mace]]\n|-\n| ([[Kerala]]) || ([[Ceylon]]) || ([[Ternate]] & [[Tidore]]) || ([[Banda Islands]]) || ([[Banda Islands]])\n|}\n\n[[Black Pepper]], grown locally in [[Kerala]], composed as much as 90% of the return cargo of the early armadas. But the other glorious spices could also be found in [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], [[Cochin]] and other major markets on the [[Malabar coast]] of India \u2013 [[cinnamon]] was imported in large amounts from [[Ceylon]], while, from further east, via [[Portuguese Malacca|Malacca]], came [[long pepper]] (from [[Java]]), [[cloves]] (grown exclusively in the [[Moluccas|Moluccan]] islands of [[Ternate]] and [[Tidore]]) and, in smaller amounts, highly valued [[nutmeg|nutmeg and mace]] (grown only in the [[Banda Islands]]).\n\nThe armadas also loaded less glorious spices found in Indian markets, notably locally-grown [[ginger]] (the principal 'filler' cargo), [[cardamom]] and [[tamarind]], balms and aromatics like [[Artemisia (plant)|''Artemisia indica'']] (wormwood), [[Aloe perryi|Socotra aloe]], [[galbanum]], [[camphor]] and [[myrrh]]. Also brought back from India were dyes like [[lac]], [[indigo]] and [[dyewood]] and precious ornamental objects and materials like [[ivory]], [[ebony]] and [[pearl]]s.\n\nIt is estimated that the average India carrack brought back between 6,100 and 6,800 [[quintal]]s of imported spices and goods \u2013 or, around 25,000 to 30,000 quintals for the average yearly India armada (4\u20135 ships).  Exceptionally large armadas and/or behemoth ships could push it up to 40,000 in some years.<ref>Steensgard (1985: p. 23)</ref>  It is estimated that around 15% of the cargo was lost at sea, spoilage, etc. over the long run.\n\nA greater difficulty involved determining the cargo on the outgoing journey. The following list, from the [[4th Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1502)|Fourth Armada]] of 1502, gives an idea of the kind of European items brought by the Portuguese to sell in India: \"cut and branch [[Coral (precious)|coral]], [[copper]] in pigs and sheets, [[Mercury (element)|quicksilver]], [[vermilion]], rugs, Flanders brass basins, coloured cloths, knives, red barret-caps, mirrors and coloured [[silk]]s.\" <ref>(Danvers, 1894 p. 87).</ref> But, by and large, European products did not sell well in Asia, which meant that ship holds were frequently empty, or nearly so, on the outward leg. In other words, outbound ships carried little more than the metal bullion \u2013 principally [[silver]], but also [[copper]] and [[lead]] \u2013 needed to purchase spices in Asian markets.<ref>Newitt (2005: p. 70)</ref>\n\nHowever, if they stopped by [[Mozambique Island]] on the outward leg (as almost all India armadas did), they could expect the local Portuguese factors to have a stockpile of East African trade goods \u2013 gold, ivory, coral, pearls, acquired during the year at several points along the [[Swahili Coast]] \u2013 ready to be picked up by the armadas for sale in India.\n\n===Factories===\n[[Image:Portugues map of India, 1630.jpg|thumb|230px| Portuguese map of India, from 1630.]]\n\nOf course, an armada could not just sail into an Indian city and expect to find enough supplies at hand in the city's spice markets to load up five or ten large ships at once. Should it even try, it would likely provoke an instant scarcity and quickly drive up the prices of spices astronomically.\n\nInstead, the Portuguese relied on the ancient 'factory' system. That is, in every major market, the Portuguese erected a warehouse ('[[Factory (trading post)|factory]]', ''feitoria'') and left behind a purchasing agent ([[Factor (agent)|'factor']], ''feitor''). The factor and his assistants would remain in the city and buy spices from the markets slowly over the course of the year, and deposit them into the warehouse. When the next armada arrived, it would simply load up the accumulated spices from the warehouse and set sail out at once.\n\n[[File:Calicut 1572.jpg|left|thumb|City of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], India, c. 1572 (from [[Georg Braun]] and Frans Hogenberg's atlas ''[[Civitates orbis terrarum]]'')]]\nThe first Portuguese factory in Asia was set up in [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (''Calecute'', Kozhikode), the principal spice entrepot on the [[Malabar Coast]] of India in September 1500, but it was overrun in a riot a couple of months later. Consequently, the first lasting factory was set up in the nearby smaller city of [[Cochin]] (''Cochim'', Kochi) in late 1500. This was followed up by factories in [[Kannur|Cannanore]] (''Canonor'', Kannur) (1502) and [[Kollam|Quilon]] (''Coul\u00e3o'', Kollam) (1503).\n\nAlthough some Portuguese factories were defended by [[palisade]]s that eventually evolved into Portuguese [[fort]]s garrisoned by Portuguese troops (e.g. [[Fort Kochi|Fort Manuel]] was erected around the Cochin factory in 1503, [[St. Angelo Fort|Fort Sant' Angelo]] around the Cannanore factory in 1505), not all did. The two concepts are distinct. Factories were commercial outposts, not political, administrative or military. The factor was formally an employee of the ''Casa da \u00cdndia'' (the trading house), not an officer of the ''Estado da \u00cdndia'' (the colonial government).\n\n===Age of Antwerp===\n[[File:Armed Four-Master Putting Out to Sea from The Sailing Vessels MET DP818236.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Engraving of a Portuguese carrack, by Frans Huys circa 1555. Identifiable by the armillary sphere it flies as a banner]]\nWhile [[Lisbon]] was the offloading point of the India armada, it was not the endpoint of the Portuguese [[spice trade]]. There remained the matter of distribution of the spices in Europe.\n\nUntil the Portuguese breakthrough into the Indian Ocean, the supply of eastern spices to European consumers had been largely in the hands of [[Republic of Venice]]. Arab and Gujarati merchants ferried spices from Indian ports like [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], across the [[Arabian Sea]] and into the [[Red Sea]] ports like [[Jeddah]]. From there, they would be carried overland to ports in the eastern [[Mediterranean]], such as [[Alexandria]], where they would be picked by Venetian merchants and then sold on European markets.\n\nThe Portuguese India armadas challenged this old spice route, for a brief period disrupted it, but they did not eliminate it. Despite Portuguese efforts to secure monopolies at the source, enough spices still slipped through the old Venetian-Arab route and forced competition on the sale end in Europe.\n\n[[File:City of Antwerp, 1572.jpg|thumb|City of [[Antwerp]], 1572 (from [[Georg Braun]] and Frans Hogenberg's atlas ''[[Civitates orbis terrarum]]'')]]\nRealizing that the Mediterranean was saturated with spices supplied by Venetian merchants, the Portuguese decided to avoid head-to-head competition that might cut into their profits there, and focused on selling their spices in northern Europe, a market the Venetians had barely touched. To this end, the Casa da \u00cdndia set up a factory (''feitoria de Flandres'') in the [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabantine]] town of [[Antwerp]] in 1508. The factory had two purposes: firstly, to serve as a distribution center of the Portuguese spices to the rest of northern Europe; secondly, to acquire the silver bullion needed by the Portuguese India armadas to buy spices in Asia.\n\nIt is in the silver trade that Portugal and Venice competed directly. Both needed large volumes of European silver to buy spices in Asia, yet the only significant silver source was in Central Europe, dominated by major German trading families like the [[Welser]]s, the [[Hochstetter]]s and the [[Fuggers]] of [[Augsburg]]. To get their hands on this silver, the Portuguese and Venetians offered gold, not only from their revenues of spice sales, but also from overseas sources: the Portuguese had access to gold from the [[Akan people|Akan]] fields on the [[Portuguese Gold Coast|Gold Coast]] of west Africa, while the Venetians had access to the gold mines of the [[Sudan]] (which was freighted up the [[Nile]] to [[Alexandria]]). Via river routes, the German silver merchants directed silver bullion supplies up to the Portuguese factory in Antwerp, from where ships would carry them to Lisbon, to be loaded onto the India armadas.\n\nThe intercontinental streams of spices, gold and silver flowing in and out of the Portuguese factory transformed Antwerp overnight from a sleepy town into arguably the leading commercial and financial center of Europe in the 16th century, a position it would enjoy until its [[Sack of Antwerp|sack by mutinous Spanish soldiers]] in 1576.\n\nRecent research has shown that, after 1505, most of the trade that moved between Lisbon and Antwerp sidestepped the Portuguese royal \"factory of Flanders\".  Most of the European leg of the trade was directly contracted between the ''Casa da \u00cdndia'' in Lisbon and private foreign consortiums (usually Italian and German) in Antwerp and freighted largely by Dutch, Hanseatic and Breton ships.  As a result, the bulk of the profits of the Portuguese spice trade accrued not to the Portuguese crown, but to the private consortiums (Smith calculates that, in 1517\u20131519, as much as half the price difference for spices between Indian and European markets was pocketed by private European merchants on this leg; by 1585, the share reaped by the Portuguese crown had fallen to a mere 15%).<ref>Smith (2008)</ref>\n\n==The End==\n\nDue to a series of costly losses in the 1550s, the ''Casa da \u00cdndia'' fell into severe financial straits and was basically bankrupt by 1560. In 1570, King [[Sebastian of Portugal]] issued a decree revoking the royal monopoly, and opening up trade with India to any private Portuguese merchant. As few took up the offer, the free trade decree was replaced in 1578 by a new system of annual monopolies, whereby the ''Casa'' sold the rights of the India trade to a private merchant consortium, guaranteeing them a monopoly for one year.  The annual monopoly system was abandoned in 1597, and the royal monopoly resumed.  But by that time, everything had changed.\n[[File:Iberian_mare_clausum_claims.svg|thumb|left|350px|Portugal claimed the Indian Ocean as its ''[[mare clausum]]'' during the [[Age of Discovery]].]]\nFor an entire century, the Portuguese had managed to monopolize the India run.  The spice trade itself was not monopolized \u2013 through the 16th century, the [[Republic of Venice]] had kept up its competition through its overland Levantine routes \u2013 but the sea route by the Cape remained exclusively Portuguese.  Despite occasional leaks (e.g. the [[Cantino planisphere]] of 1502), details of the Portuguese ''Carreira da \u00cdndia'' had been largely kept secret, or at least was not exploited by competitors.  But this changed in the 1590s.\n\nThe capture of the Portuguese ship ''S\u00e3o Filipe'' by the English privateer Sir Francis Drake in 1587, with its [[rutter (nautical)|rutter]] and detailed maps, prompted the first English attempt to sail to the East Indies, a private three-ship fleet organized by London merchants, and led by Sir [[James Lancaster]].  It was a disaster \u2013 most of the ships and crews were lost, and Lancaster had to resort to piracy to fill his hold \u2013 but it opened the way.\n\nIn the Netherlands, the preacher and cartographer [[Petrus Plancius]] had long been urging his countrymen to set out on their own route, rather than relying on the Portuguese hauls.  The Dutch effort received an injection from the information provided by [[Cornelis de Houtman]], a Dutch spy dispatched to Lisbon in 1592 to scout the spice trade, and [[Jan Huyghen van Linschoten]], a Dutch sailor who had served on many Portuguese India armadas from the 1580s.  With this information in hand, the Dutch finally made their move in 1595, when a group of [[Amsterdam]] merchants formed the ''Compagnie van Verre'' and sent out their first expedition, under de Houtman, to the East Indies, aiming for the market port of [[Bantam (city)|Bantam]].  That same year, Linschoten published a little tract in Amsterdam entitled ''Reysgheschrift vande navigatien der Portugaloysers in Orienten'' (Travel Account of the Voyages of the Portuguese in the Orient),  a [[rutter (nautical)|rutter]] giving the details of the sailing directions of the Portuguese India Run.  It was republished in 1596, as part of a larger book, the ''Itinerario'', where Linschoten gave the details of the trade and the condition of Portuguese defenses in Asia.  It was an explosive sensation. It was immediately translated into English, German, Latin and soon French.\n\n1597 was the bellwether year \u2013 the year of Houtman's successful return, and the spread of Linschoten's tracts. A slate of new Dutch companies (''voorcompagnie'') to trade with the East Indies were immediately erected by various competing merchant consortiums in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Middelburg and elsewhere \u2013 often with the help of exiled Antwerp merchants ('Brabantsche'), who had long been involved on the distribution end of the Portuguese spice trade, but expelled due to the Dutch-Spanish conflict. At least fifteen separate Dutch expeditions to the East Indies, each involving enormous numbers of men, ships, and amounts of treasure, were sent out by the ''voorcompanies'' in 1598\u20131601. From this enthusiastic anarchic beginning, the Dutch trade got organized in 1601, when the Dutch government forced the voorcompagnie to fold under a single monopoly company, the ''[[Dutch East India Company|Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie]]'' (VOC).\n\nFearful of being left behind, the English had founded their own [[East India Company]] (EIC) in 1600, and managed to organize a small English expedition to Bantam in 1601, but enthusiasm was weaker and the EIC had problems competing with the better-organized and better-financed Dutch.\n\nThe vigorous [[Dutch East India Company|Dutch VOC]] and [[East India Company|English EIC]] encroachments on the [[Portuguese empire]] and trade in Asia, prompted the monarchy (then in [[Iberian Union]] with Spain) to experiment with different arrangements.  In 1624, [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip III of Portugal]] granted a monopoly charter to a Portuguese ''[[Portuguese East India Company|Companhia do comm\u00e9rcio da \u00cdndia]]'', a private joint-stock company organized on the same lines as the Dutch and English companies. The ''Companhia'' was to take over all the  responsibilities of the ''Casa da \u00cdndia'', including the annual India armada.<ref>Silva (1974); Disney (1977)</ref>  It proved to be a fiasco. The Anglo-Dutch breach of the Portuguese East Indies trade was irreparable by this time, squeezing profit margins and rendering the ''Companhia'' unprofitable.  It was liquidated in 1633, and what remained of the dwindling Portuguese India trade was brought back under the royal ''Casa da \u00cdndia''.\n\n==Sources==\nWhat seems like the first chronology of the Portuguese India armadas can be found in the magnificently illustrated codex known as the ''Livro de Lisuarte de Abreu'' (\"Book of Lisuarte de Abreu\", named after the man who ordered the compilation). It covers the period from Vasco da Gama's first trip (1497\u201399) to the end of 1563. It is conserved at the [[Pierpont Morgan Library]] in [[New York City]] (ms. 525).\n\nAnother codex of the same nature is the ''Mem\u00f3ria das Armadas que de Portugal passaram \u00e0 \u00cdndia'' (\"Memory of the Armadas that from Portugal passed to India\") or ''Livro das Armadas'', held by the [[Sciences Academy of Lisbon|Academia das Ci\u00eancias]] in [[Lisbon]]. It covers the period from 1497 to 1567 (although missing the armada of 1517).\n\nThe first Portuguese chronicler to attempt a systematic chronology of the India Armadas seems to have been [[Diogo do Couto]], in his appendix to [[Jo\u00e3o de Barros]]'s ''D\u00e9cadas da \u00c1sia'' (\"Decades of Asia\"), entitled \" \"De todas as Armadas que os Reys de Portugal mand\u00e1ram \u00e0 \u00cdndia, at\u00e9 que El-Rey D. Filippe succedeo nestes Reynos\", de 1497 a 1581\" (Dec X, Pt.1, Bk. 1, c.16).\n\nOther codices include \"''Rela\u00e7\u00e3o das N\u00e1os e Armadas da India com os Sucessos dellas que se puderam Saber, para Noticia e Instruc\u00e7\u00e3o dos Curiozos, e Amantes da Historia da India''\" (\"Relation of the Ships and Armadas of India\") (Codex Add. 20902 of the [[British Library]]), covering the period from 1497 to 1653. It was compiled on the order of D. [[Ant\u00f3nio de Ata\u00edde]], who was himself responsible for a good part of its extensive marginal annotations. Other annotations were added by later unidentified writers.\n\nOne of the more exhaustive chronologies, at least up to 1640, was compiled by [[Manuel de Faria e Sousa]] in his ''\u00c1sia Portugueza'' (part III, end of volume), published posthumously in 1675. Faria e Sousa includes not only the India Armadas, but all the Portuguese fleets from 1412, including those dispatched to Africa under Prince [[Henry the Navigator]].\n\nThere are several [[chronicle]]s of Portuguese India written by contemporaries and historians, which provide substantive descriptions of the various armadas. [[Jo\u00e3o de Barros]]'s ''D\u00e9cadas da \u00c1sia'' and [[Dami\u00e3o de G\u00f3is]]'s royal chronicles (''Cr\u00f3nica do Felic\u00edssimo Rei D. Manuel'', 1566\u201367 and ''Cr\u00f3nica do Principe D. Jo\u00e3o'', 1567) were official chronicles. As a result, while comprehensive, they have the drawbacks of being carefully [[censorship|censored]] and consciously [[propaganda|propagandistic]]. Both Barros and Gois constructed their accounts primarily from archives in Lisbon although Barros's vast work was far more comprehensive and more conscientiously faithful to accuracy (G\u00f3is's was an unabashed [[hagiography]], whereas Barros frequently updated his account on the discovery of any new scrap of information). Barros's work was supplemented later by several additional volumes written by [[Diogo do Couto]], who had spent most of his career in India.<ref>Russell-Wood (1992: p. 210)</ref>\n\nOf the unofficial accounts, [[Jer\u00f3nimo Os\u00f3rio]]'s ''De rebus Emmanuelis'', is essentially a [[Latin]] restatement of the earlier chronicles, hoping for a wider European audience, and provides little that we don't already know. [[Fern\u00e3o Lopes de Castanheda]]'s ''Hist\u00f3ria do descobrimento e conquista da \u00cdndia pelos portugueses'' (\"History of the Discovery and Conquest of the East Indies by the Portuguese\", 1554\u201359), although unofficial, is generally regarded as 'respectable' and reliable. Unlike Barros, G\u00f3is or Os\u00f3rio, Castanheda actually visited the East, spending ten years in India, and supplemented the archival material with independent interviews he conducted there and back in Coimbra.\n\nDistinct from all the others is [[Gaspar Correia]]'s ''Lendas da \u00cdndia'' (\"Legends of India\", written c. 1556, manuscript found and published only in 1885). This is almost entirely original material, his facts and names are often at variance with the official chronicles. Correia spent nearly his entire life in India, and drew primarily from materials available there. His style of writing is also much more entertaining, intense and replete with 'gossipy' details. Although not regarded as reliable, Correia's account supplies a lot of information that the others miss or prefer to remain silent on.\n\nBesides these comprehensive chronicles, there are many accounts of particular armadas \u2013 on-board diaries, accounts, memoirs and letters written by their passengers.\n\nThere is quite some conflict between the various sources over the exact composition of the various India Armadas, particularly in the names of the captains of the vessels. Attempts have been made to reconcile the differences between the sources (e.g. Quintella's ''Annaes da Marinha Portugueza''), although these inevitably involve some degree of conjecture, dispute and revision.\n\n==The Armadas==\n\n===1497===\n{{main|Portuguese discovery of the sea route to India}}\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\" cellpadding=5\n|style=\"border-bottom:3px solid; background:#efefef;\"|'''1st India Armada (Vasco da Gama)''' ||style=\"border-bottom:3px solid; background:#efefef;\"|\n|-\n|-valign=\"top\"\n|Departed: April 1497 <br/> Arrived in India: May 1498 <br/> -------------------------<br/>Left India: October 1498 <br/> Arrived Portugal: July (Coelho)/Aug (Gama) 1499. <br/>-------------------------<br/>Notes: <br/>\u2013 Travails with [[Island of Mozambique|Mozambique]] and [[Mombassa]], <br/>\u2013 opened relations with [[Malindi]] <br/>\u2013 Opened sea route to India ([[Kozhikode|Calicut]]) <br/>\u2013 one ship scuttled on return journey || '''Fleet''': 4 ships (2 naus, 1 caravel, 1 supply ship), 170 men<br/> 1.

These armadas undertook the '''''Carreira da \u00cdndia''''' (\"India Run\"), following the sea route around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] first opened up by [[Vasco da Gama]] in 1497\u20131499.\n\n==The India run==\nFor a long time after its discovery by Vasco da Gama, the sea route to India via the [[Cape of Good Hope]] was dominated by the Portuguese India armada \u2013 the annual fleet dispatched from Portugal to India. Between 1497 and 1650, there were 1033 departures of ships at [[Lisbon]] for the ''Carreira da \u00cdndia'' (\"India Run\").<ref>Guinote, P.J.A.

Godinho (1963: v. 3, pp. 43\u201344) calculates that 87% of departures left in March or April, and the 13% outside that range were usually destined for elsewhere (Africa, Arabia).</ref> The critical determinant of the timing was the [[monsoon]] winds of the [[Indian Ocean]]. The monsoon was a southwesterly wind (i.e. blew from East Africa to India) in the summer (between May and September) and then abruptly reversed itself and became a northeasterly (from India to Africa) in the winter (between October and April). The ideal timing was to pass the [[Cape of Good Hope]] around June\u2013July and get to the [[East Africa]]n middle coast by August, just in time to catch the summer monsoon winds to India, arriving around early September. The return trip from India would typically begin in January, taking the winter monsoon back to Lisbon along a similar route, arriving by the summer (June\u2013August). Overall, the round trip took a little over a year, minimizing the time at sea.\n\nThe critical step was ensuring the armada reached East Africa on time. Ships that failed to reach the [[equator]] latitude on the East African coast by late August would be stuck in Africa and have to wait until next Spring to undertake an Indian Ocean crossing. And then they would have to wait in India until the Winter to begin their return. So any delay in East Africa during those critical few weeks of August could end up adding an entire extra year to a ship's journey.<ref group = \"N\">Godinho (1963: v. 3, p. 44) calculates that around 11% of outgoing ships missed the monsoon and ended up having to winter in East Africa.</ref>\n\nThe circumnavigation of [[Madagascar]] opened an alternative route to get to India, which gave more flexibility in timing. The rule that quickly emerged was that if an outbound armada doubled the Cape of Good Hope before mid-July, then it should follow the old \"inner route\" \u2013 that is, sail into the [[Mozambique Channel]], up the East African coast until the equator latitude (around [[Malindi]], [[Seychelles]]), then take the southwesterly monsoon across the ocean to India. If, however, the armada doubled the Cape after mid-July, then it was obliged to sail the \"outer route\" \u2013 that is, strike out straight east from South Africa, go under the southern tip of Madagascar, and then turn up from there, taking a northerly path through the [[Mascarenes]] islands, across the open ocean to India. While the outer route did not have the support of African staging posts and important watering stops, it sidestepped sailing directly against the post-summer monsoon.<ref>Matthew (1988: 233); Pimentel (1746: pp. 385\u2013386)</ref>\n[[File:Goa-Vasco 03-2016 02 Vaddem.jpg|thumb|left|180px|A brief view of the [[India]]n city of [[Vasco da Gama, Goa|Vasco da Gama]]]]\nReturn fleets were a different story.  The principal worry of the return fleets was the fast dangerous waters of the inner Mozambican channel, which was particularly precarious for heavily loaded and less maneuverable ships.  In the initial decades, the return fleet usually set out from [[Cochin]] in December, although that was eventually pushed forward to January.  January 20 was the critical date, after which all return fleets were obliged to follow the outer route (east of Madagascar) which was deemed calmer and safer for their precious cargo.<ref>Godinho (1963: v. 3, p. 45)</ref>  That meant they missed the important watering stop on Mozambique island on the return leg and had to put in elsewhere later, such as [[Mossel Bay]] or [[St. Helena]].  Between 1525 and 1579, ''all'' return fleets were ordered to follow the outer route. This rule was temporarily suspended between the 1570s and 1590s. From 1615, a new rule was introduced whereby return fleets from [[Goa]] were allowed to use the inner route, but return fleets from Cochin still had to use the outer route.<ref>Matthew (1988: 233)</ref>  With the entry of Dutch and English competition in the 1590s, the start of the return legs were delayed until February and March, with the predictable upsurge in lost and weather-delayed ships.<ref name=\"Godinho 1963, v.3:p.46\">Godinho (1963: v. 3, p. 46)</ref>\n\nArrival times in Portugal varied, usually between mid-June and late August.  It was customary for return fleets to send their fastest ship ahead to announce the results in Lisbon, before the rest of the fleet arrived later that summer.<ref name=\"Godinho 1963, v.3:p.46\"/>\n\nBecause of the timing, an armada had to leave Lisbon (February\u2013April) before the previous year's armada returned (June\u2013August). To get news of the latest developments in India, the outgoing armada relied on notes and reports left along the way at various African staging posts by the returning fleet.\n\n===Outward voyage===\n\nPortuguese India armadas tended to follow the same outward route.  There were several staging posts along the route of India Run that were repeatedly used.<ref group=\"N\">For old ''[[Rutter (nautical)|roteiro]]''s of the India Run, see [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] (1509), [[Jo\u00e3o de Lisboa]] (1519: pp. 69ff) and Manuel Pimentel (1746: pp. 381ff)</ref>\n\nSetting out from [[Lisbon]] (February\u2013April), India-bound [[naus]] took the easy [[Canary Current]] straight southwest to the [[Canary Islands]]. The islands were owned by [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and so this was not a usual watering stop for the Portuguese India naus, except in emergencies.\n\nThe first real obstacle on the route was the [[Cap-Vert|Cape Verde]] peninsula (Cap-Vert, [[Senegal]]), around which the Canary Current ends and the equatorial drift begins. Although not difficult to double, it was a concentration point of sudden storms and [[Cape Verde-type hurricane|tropical cyclones]], so ships were frequently damaged. (see [[Cape Verde-type hurricane]])\n\nThe [[Cape Verde islands]], to the west of Cape Verde peninsula was the usual first stop for India ships. Relative scarcity of water and supplies on the islands made this a suboptimal stop. Nonetheless, the islands (esp. [[Santiago, Cape Verde|Santiago]]) served as a harbor against storms and was frequently a pre-arranged point for the collection and repair of tempest-tossed ships.\n\nThe ''Angra de Bezeguiche'' (Bay of [[Dakar]], Senegal) was a common watering stop for ships after doubling Cape Verde. The shores were controlled by [[Wolof people|Wolof]] and [[Serer people|Serer]] kingdoms, whose relations with the Portuguese were ambivalent, so a warm reception on the mainland could not always be counted on. In the middle of the bay was the island of [[Gor\u00e9e]] (''ilha de Bezeguiche''), a safe anchoring spot, but the island itself lacked drinkable water. As a result, ships frequently watered and repaired at certain mainland points along the [[Petite C\u00f4te]] of Senegal shore such as ''Rio Fresco'' (now [[Rufisque]]) and ''Porto de Ale'' (now  [[Saly|Saly-Portudal]]). It was not unheard of for India naus to water much further south, e.g. among the many inlets and islands (e.g. [[Bissagos Islands|Bissagos]]) along the African coast to ''Serra Leoa'' ([[Sierra Leone]]).\n\nBelow Cape Verde, around the latitudes of Sierra Leone, begin the Atlantic [[doldrums]] \u2013 that is a calm low pressure region on either side of the equator with little or no winds.  At this time of year, the doldrums belt usually ranged between 5\u00b0 N and 5\u00b0 S. <ref group=\"N\">The exact latitude where the doldrums lay varies because of the \"Atlantic mini-monsoon\" phenomenon, i.e. during the summer months, the heating of West African mainland pulls winds up from the equator, thereby shunting the doldrums belt further north.</ref>  In the southern hemisphere, below the doldrums, was the counter-clockwise [[Ocean gyre|gyre]] of the [[South Atlantic Gyre|South Atlantic]] and the southeasterly [[trade wind]]s, which prevented sailing directly southeast to the Cape.\n\nPassing the doldrums was a navigational challenge, and pilots had to avail themselves deftly of the currents and every little breeze they could get to stay on course. The usual tactic was to proceed south or even southeast along the West African coast as long as possible, until the doldrums hit (usually around Sierra Leone), then to strike southwest sharply, drift over the doldrums and then catch the [[South Equatorial Current]] (top arm of the South Atlantic gyre) towards the coast of [[Brazil]]. This was usually referred to as following the ''[[volta do mar]]'' (literally, 'turn of the sea', i.e. the South Atlantic gyre).\n\n[[File:Map of Portuguese Carreira da India.gif|450px|thumb|Outward and return voyages of the Portuguese India run (''Carreira da \u00cdndia'')]]\n[The ''volta do mar'' was usually contrasted to the ''rota da Mina'' (Mina route). The latter meant striking ''southeast'' in the doldrums to catch the  [[Equatorial Counter Current]] (or 'Guinea Current') east into the [[Gulf of Guinea]]. This was the usual route to the fort of [[Elmina|S\u00e3o Jorge da Mina]] on the [[Portuguese Gold Coast]]. This was ''not'' part of the India run.  The route from Mina down to South Africa involved [[tacking (sailing)|tacking]] ''against'' the southeasterly trade winds and the contrary [[Benguela Current]], a particularly tiresome task for heavy [[square rig]]ged [[carrack]]s. However, it sometimes happened that by poor piloting, India naus would be inadvertently caught by the Guinea counter-current and forced to take that route, but such ships would not be likely to reach India that year.]<ref group=\"N\">The ''rota da Mina'' had been the usual route used by all Portuguese explorers to Africa until the end of the 15th century. The first fleet to sail the ''volta do mar'' was [[Vasco da Gama]]'s first fleet in 1497. However, credit for the discovery of the 'volta do mar' as a route to the Cape ought to be given to [[Bartolomeu Dias]], who in 1488\u201389, first discovered the [[westerlies]] below the 30\u00b0S and the [[South Atlantic Current]], from which was deduced the probable existence of the quicker and easier ''volta do mar'' route to the Cape. See Coutinho (1951\u20135: 319\u201363) and Waters (1988)</ref>\n\nAssuming the India armada successfully caught the south equatorial current of the ''volta do mar'', the armada would drift southwest through the doldrums and reach the southbound [[Brazil Current]] off the coast of Brazil (around [[Pernambuco]]). Although India naus did not usually stop in Brazil, it was not unheard of to put in a brief watering stop at [[Cabo de Santo Agostinho|Cape Santo Agostinho]] (Pernambuco, Brazil), especially if the southeasterly trade winds were particularly strong (pilots had to be careful not to allow themselves to be caught and driven backwards).\n\nFrom the environs of Pernambuco, the India [[naus]] sailed straight south along the Brazil Current, until about the latitude of the [[Tropic of Capricorn]], visibly the [[Abrolhos Archipelago|Abrolhos]] islands or the [[Trindade and Martim Vaz]] islands, where they began to catch more favorable prevailing [[westerlies]]. These would take them quickly straight east, across the South Atlantic, to South Africa.\n\nThe [[Cape of Good Hope]] \u2013 once aptly named the 'cape of storms' \u2013 was a very challenging headland on the India Run. The outbound crossing was always difficult, and many a ship was lost here. Larger armadas often broke up into smaller squadrons to attempt the crossing, and would re-collect only on the other side \u2013 indeed quite far on the other side. There was usually no stop or collection point after the Cape crossing until well inside the [[Mozambique Channel]]. The reason for this is that outbound ships tried to steer clear from the South African coast, to avoid the rushing waters of the contrary [[Agulhas Current]].\n\nThe exception was the ''Agoada de S\u00e3o Br\u00e1s'' ([[Mossel Bay]], South Africa), a watering stop after the Cape. It was not always used on the outbound journey since individual ships often charted wide routes around the Cape, and sighted coast again only well after this point. However, ships damaged during the crossing frequently had no choice but to put in there for emergency repairs. Trade for food supplies with the pastoral [[Khoikhoi]] peoples that lived in the area was frequent (although there were also occasional skirmishes). S\u00e3o Br\u00e1s was a more frequent stop on the return journey, as a place to repair the ships before doubling the Cape the other way. As a result, particularly in early years, S\u00e3o Br\u00e1s was used as a postal station, where messages from the returning armadas would be left for the outward armadas, reporting on the latest conditions in India.\n\n[[File:Bonne - Afrique, cote orientale.jpg|thumb|300px| French map of [[Mozambique Channel]], c. 1791]]\n\nIf the armada went by the 'inner route', then the next daunting obstacle was [[Cape Correntes]], at the entrance of the Mozambique Channel. Treacherously fast waters, light winds alternating with unpredictably violent gusts, and dangerous shoals and rocks made this cape particularly dangerous. It is estimated that of all the ships lost on the India run, nearly 30% of them capsized or ran aground around here - more than any other place.<ref>Guinote (1999). The dangers of the 'inner route' through the Mozambique channel are summarized in many old sailing rutters, e.g. Pimentel (1746: pp. 386ff), Hornsborough (1852, p. 211), Findlay (1866: 115).</ref>\n\nThe ideal passage through the Mozambique Channel would be to sail straight north through the middle of the channel, where a steady favorable wind could be relied upon at this season. But this was a particularly hard task in an era where [[longitude]] was determined largely by [[dead reckoning]]. If a pilot miscalculated and charted a course too close to the African coast, the current ran south, the winds were light or non-existent, subject to arbitrary gusts from strange directions and the coasts littered with [[shoals]].<ref group=\"N\">Indeed, another reason ships steered clear away from the South African coast after crossing the Cape of Good Hope was precisely that the contrary [[Agulhas current]] threw off the dead reckoning calculations, and often misled pilots into turning too soon into the Mozambique channel, forcing them on a dangerous too-western route up the channel.</ref>  Into this dreaded mix, Cape Correntes added its own special terror to the experience. The Cape was not only a confluence point of opposing winds, creating unpredictable whirlwinds, it also produced a strange and extraordinarily fast southerly current, violent enough to break a badly-sewn ship, and confusing enough to throw all reckoning out the window and lure pilots into grievous errors.\n\nThe temptation would be to err in the opposite direction, and keep on pushing east until the island of [[Madagascar]] was sighted, then move up the channel (the current here ran north), keeping the Madagascar coast in sight at all times. Although a Madagascar-hugging route cleared up the longitude problem, it was also abundant in fearful obstacles \u2013 coral islets, atolls, shoals, protruding rocks, submerged reefs, made for a particularly nerve-wracking experience to navigate, especially at night or in bad weather.\n\nTo avoid the worst consequences of doubling Cape Correntes, India ships stayed as far from the African coast as possible but not so close to Madagascar to run into its traps. To find the ideal middle route through the channel, pilots tended to rely on two dangerous longitude markers \u2013 the [[Bassas da India]] and the [[Europa Island|Europa rocks]].<ref>Pimentel (1746: 385\u2013386)</ref>  Although conveniently situated in the middle of the channel, they were not always visible above the waves, so sailors often watched for hovering clusters of [[seabird]]s, which colonized these rocks, as an indicator of their location.  Unfortunately, this was not a reliable method, and many an India ship ended up crashing on those rocks.\n\nIf they succeeded sailing up the middle channel, the India naus usually saw African coast again only around the bend of [[Angoche]]. If the ships were in a bad shape, they could stop at the [[Primeiras and Segundas Archipelago|Primeiras Islands]] (off Angoche) for urgent repairs. The Primeiras are a long row of uninhabited low coral islets \u2013 not much more than mounds above the waves \u2013 but they form a channel of calm waters between themselves and the mainland, a useful shelter for troubled ships.\n\n[[File:Ilha de Mo\u00e7ambique.jpg|thumb|250px| left|[[Mozambique Island]], with [[Fort S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o]] in background]]\nThe scheduled stop was a little further north on [[Mozambique Island]], a coral island off the coast, with two outlying smaller islands (''S\u00e3o Jorge'' and ''Sant' Iago''). Mozambique's main attribute was its splendid harbor, that served as the usual first stop and collection point of Portuguese India armadas after the crossing of the Cape of Good Hope. The island had a town and a fortress, so some stock of supplies was usually at hand.\n\nThe conditions of the ships by the time they reached Mozambique was often quite woeful. Notice that with the occasional exception of Cape Santo Agostinho and Mossel Bay, there are no stops between Cape Verde and Mozambique Island, an extraordinarily long time for 16th-century ships to remain at sea without repairs, watering or resupply. Already before the Cape, provisions had grown stale, [[scurvy]] and [[dysentery]] had often set in, and deaths of crews and passengers from disease had begun. The ship itself, so long at sea without [[Caulking#Wooden shipbuilding|re-caulking]] or re-painting, was in a fragile state. To then force the miserable ship through the mast-cracking tempests of Cape of Good Hope, the seam-ripping violent waters of Cape Correntes and the treacherous rocks of the channel, turned this final stage into a veritable hell for all aboard.<ref>Diffie and Winius (p. 201)</ref>\n\nMozambique Island was originally an outpost of the [[Kilwa Sultanate]], a collection of Muslim [[Swahili people|Swahili]] cities along the East African coast, centered at [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]], that formed a Medieval commercial empire from Cape Correntes in the south to the Somali borderlands in the north, what is sometimes called the \"[[Swahili Coast]]\". The Kilwa Sultanate began disintegrating into independent city-states around the time of the Portuguese arrival (1500), a process speeded along by the intrigues and interventions of Portuguese captains.\n\nThe original object of Portuguese attentions had been the southerly Swahili city of [[Sofala]], the main outlet of the [[Monomatapa]] gold trade, and the first Portuguese fortress in East Africa was erected there in 1505 ([[Fort S\u00e3o Caetano]] de Sofala).  But Sofala's harbor was marred by a long moving sandbank and hazardous shoals, making it quite unsuitable as a stop for the India armadas.  So in 1507, the 9th Portuguese India Armada (Mello, 1507) seized Mozambique Island and erected a fortress there (Fort S\u00e3o Gabriel, later replaced by [[Fort S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o]] in 1558), to use its spacious and well-sheltered harbor.\n\n[[File:East Africa, c.1500.jpg|thumb|300px| Principal cities of the [[Swahili Coast]] of East Africa, c. 1500.]]\nThe principal drawback was that Mozambique Island was parched and infertile. It produced practically nothing locally, it even had to ferry drinkable water by boat from elsewhere.<ref>Theal (1902, p. 118)</ref>  Replenishing the islands was not a simple matter. Although Mozambique islanders had established watering holes, gardens and coconut palm groves (essential for timber) just across on the mainland (at ''Cabaceira'' inlet), the [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] inhabitants of the area were generally hostile to both the Swahili and the Portuguese, and often prevented the collection of supplies.<ref>Theal (1902, p. 118). The hostility of the Bantus of Cabaceira may be related to old slave-raiding in the area.</ref>   So ensuring Mozambique had sufficient supplies presented its own challenges. The Portuguese [[Factor (agent)|factor]]s in Mozambique had to ensure enough supplies were shipped in from other points on the East African coast to Mozambique Island before the armada's scheduled arrival. The Mozambican factor also collected East African trade goods that could be picked up by the armadas and sold profitably in Indian markets \u2013 notably [[gold]], [[ivory]], [[copper]], [[pearl]]s and [[coral]].\n\nAfter Mozambique, the rule for the India armadas was generally to continue sailing north until they reached the [[equator]] latitude (the [[Seychelles]] islands, at 4\u00baS, were a common reference point). It was around here that the all-important southwesterly [[monsoon]] winds began to pick up. The armada would then just sail east, and let the monsoon carry them headlong across the Indian Ocean until India. That is presuming the armada arrived at the equator sometime in August.\n\nIn Pimentel's (1746) estimation, ships ''must'' leave Mozambique before August 25 to avail themselves of the summer monsoon. If, however, the armada arrived in the latter part of the season, say September, turning at the equator was a risky route. The southwesterly monsoon may be blowing in the right direction at the moment, but the ship ran the risk of not reaching a safe Indian port before the monsoon reversed direction (usually around late September to early October, when it became a northeasterly). So a late season ship was usually stuck in Africa until next April.\n\nNotice that the trajectory, as described, skips over nearly all the towns on the East African coast north of Mozambique \u2013 [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]] (''Qu\u00edloa''), [[Zanzibar]], [[Mombasa]] (''Momba\u00e7a''), [[Malindi]] (''Melinde''), [[Barawa]] (''Brava''), [[Mogadishu]] (''Magadoxo''), etc. This is not to say Portuguese did not visit those locations \u2013 indeed, some even had Portuguese factories and forts (e.g. Fort Santiago in Kilwa, held from 1505 to 1512). But Portuguese armadas on their way to India did not have to stop at those locations, and so usually did not. The stop on Mozambique island was usually the only necessary one.\n\n[[File:Pillar of Vasco da Gama.jpg|thumb|250px| left|[[Padr\u00e3o]] of [[Vasco da Gama]], at [[Malindi]], Kenya.]]\nNonetheless, if it had time, or got into trouble for some reason, the stopping choice was [[Malindi]]. A Portuguese ally from the earliest trip of Vasco da Gama in 1498, Malindi could usually be counted on to give a warm reception and had plenty of supplies. Unlike most other Swahili towns, Malindi was on the mainland and had an ample hinterlands with fertile cultivated fields, including groves of oranges and lemons (critical to [[Ascorbic acid|combat scurvy]]). The problem was that Malindi didn't really have a suitable harbor. Although waters were kept calm by an offshore reef, the anchorage area was littered with shoals. It did, however, have a peculiar protruding rock that served as a decent natural [[pier]] for loading and unloading goods.<ref>Theal (1902, p. 115)</ref>\n\nMalindi's other advantage was that, at 3\u00ba15'S, it was practically at exactly the right latitude to catch the southwesterly monsoon for an Indian Ocean crossing. Plenty of experienced Indian Ocean pilots \u2013 Swahili, Arab or Gujurati \u2013 could be found in the city, and Malindi was likely to have the latest news from across the sea.  So it was a very convenient stop for the Portuguese before a crossing.  However, stops take time. Given the imminent monsoon reversal, that was a scarce commodity. So if the armada had been decently equipped enough at Mozambique island, a stop at Malindi, however delightful or useful, was a rather unnecessary and risky expenditure of time.\n\nWith the monsoon, Portuguese India armadas usually arrived in India in early September (sometimes late August).  Because of the wind pattern, they usually made landfall around [[Anjediva]] island (''Angediva'').  From there, the armada furled their square sails and proceed with lateen sails south along the [[Malabar Coast|Malabar]] coast of India to the city of [[Cochin]] (''Cochim'', Kochi) in [[Kerala]].  Cochin was the principal spice port accessible to the Portuguese, it had the earliest Portuguese factory and fort in India, and served as the headquarters of Portuguese government and operations in India for the first decades.  However, this changed after the [[Portuguese conquest of Goa]] in 1510.  The capture of Goa had been largely motivated by the desire to find a replacement for Anjediva as the first anchoring point for the armadas.  Anjediva had proven itself to be far from ideal.  The island was generally undersupplied \u2013 it contained only a few fishing villages \u2013 but the armada ships were often forced to sojourn there for long periods, usually for repair or to await for better winds to carry them down to Cochin.  Anjediva island also lay in precarious pirate-infested waters, on the warring frontier between Muslim Bijapur and Hindu Vijaynagar, which frequently threatened it. The same winds which carried the armada down to Cochin prevented Portuguese squads from Cochin racing up to rescue it.  The Portuguese had tried setting up a fort in Anjediva, but it was captured and dismantled by forces on behalf of Bijapur.  As a result, the Portuguese governor [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] decided the nearby island-city of [[Goa]] was preferable and forcibly seized it in 1510.  Thereafter Goa, with its better harbor and greater supply base, served as the first anchorage point of Portuguese armadas upon arriving in India.  Although Cochin, with its important spice markets, remained the ultimate destination, and was still the official Portuguese headquarters in India until the 1530s, Goa was more favorably located relative to Indian Ocean wind patterns and served as its military-naval center.  The docks of Goa were soon producing their own carracks for the India run back to Portugal and for runs to further points east.\n\n===Return voyage===\nThe return voyage was shorter than the outbound. The fleet left India in December, picking up the [[Monsoon#Northeast monsoon|northeast monsoon]] towards the African coast. Passing through the Mozambique Channel, the fleet kept close to land to avoid the westerlies and catch the [[Agulhas Current]] to round the Cape of Good Hope. Once in the Atlantic, it caught the southeast trade winds and sailed to the west of [[Ascension Island|Ascension]] and [[Saint Helena]] as far as the doldrums. The fleet then sailed almost straight north to the [[Azores]], where it caught the prevailing westerlies and sailed due west into Lisbon.<ref>Alexander Marchant, \"Colonial Brazil as a Way Station for the Portuguese India Fleets\", ''Geographical Review'', Vol. 31, No. 3 (1941), p. 463.</ref>\n\n==Logistics of the Armadas==\n\n===Organization===\n[[Image:Departure of fleet from Lisbon harbor.jpg|thumb|right|350px| Departure of fleet for the Indies from Lisbon harbor, by [[Theodor de Bry]], 1592]]\nThe size of the armada varied, from enormous fleets of twenty-something ships, to small fleets of only four or five.   This changed over time. In the first decade (1500\u20131510), when the Portuguese were establishing themselves in India, the armadas averaged around 15 ships per year. This declined to around 9\u201310 ships in 1510\u20131525. From 1526 to the 1540s, the armadas declined further to 7\u20138 ships per year, with a few exceptional cases of large armadas (e.g. 1533, 1537, 1547) brought about by military exigency, but also several years of exceptionally small fleets. In the second half of the 16th century, the Portuguese India armada stabilized at 5\u20136 ships annually, with very few exceptions (rose above seven only in 1551 & 1590 and below 4 only in 1594 and 1597).<ref name=\"Guinote 1999\">Guinote (1999)</ref>\n\nOrganization was principally in the hands of the ''[[Casa da \u00cdndia]]'', the royal trading house established around 1500 by King [[Manuel I of Portugal]]. The Casa was in charge of monitoring the crown monopoly on India trade \u2013 receiving goods, collecting [[Tariff#Customs duty|duties]], assembling, maintaining and scheduling the fleets, contracting private merchants, correspondence with the ''feitorias'' (overseas [[Factory (trading post)|factories]]), drafting documents and handling legal matters.\n\nSeparately from the ''Casa'', but working in coordination with it, was the ''Armaz\u00e9m das \u00cdndias'', the royal agency in charge of nautical outfitting, that oversaw the Lisbon docks and naval arsenal. The Armaz\u00e9m was responsible for the training of pilots and sailors, ship construction and repair, and the procurement and provision of naval equipment \u2013 sails, ropes, guns, instruments and, most importantly, maps. The ''piloto-mor'' ('chief pilot') of the Armaz\u00e9m, in charge of pilot-training, was, up until 1548, also the keeper of the ''[[Padr\u00e3o Real]]'', the secret royal master map, incorporating all the cartographic details reported by Portuguese captains and explorers, and upon which all official nautical charts were based. The screening and hiring of crews was the function of the ''provedor'' of the Armaz\u00e9m.\n\n[[File:City of Lisbon, 1572.jpg|left|thumb|Ribeira Palace in the foreground of this view of the city of [[Lisbon]], Portugal from [[Georg Braun]] and Frans Hogenberg's atlas ''[[Civitates orbis terrarum]]'', 1572]]\nFrom at least 1511 (perhaps earlier), the offices of the Casa da India were based in the ground floor of the royal [[Ribeira Palace]], by the [[Pra\u00e7a do Com\u00e9rcio|Terreiro do Pa\u00e7o]] in Lisbon, with the Armaz\u00e9m nearby. (Neither the Casa nor the Armazem should be confused with the ''[[Estado da \u00cdndia]]'', the Portuguese colonial government in India, which was separate and reported directly to the monarch.)\n\nShips could be and sometimes were owned and outfitted by private merchants, and these were incorporated into the India armada. However, the expenses of outfitting a ship were immense, and few native Portuguese merchants had the wherewithal to finance one, despite eager government encouragement. In the early India runs, there are several ships organized by private consortiums, often with foreign capital provided by wealthy Italian and German trading houses. This fluctuated over time, as the royal duties, costs of outfitting and rate of attrition and risk of loss on India runs were sometimes too high for private houses to bear. Private Portuguese merchants did, however, routinely contract for cargo, carried aboard crown ships for freight charges.\n\n[[Marine insurance]] was still underdeveloped, although the Portuguese had helped pioneer its development and its practice seemed already customary.<ref>De Souza (1977), Diffie & Winius (1977: pp. 38, 101.)</ref>  <ref group=\"N\">In May, 1293, King [[Denis of Portugal]] had established the ''Sociedade de Mercadores Portugueses'' (Society of Portuguese Merchants), with mutual help clauses that formed the kernel of marine insurance contracts, similar to those in practice in Italian ports such as [[Genoa]] and [[Pisa]]. In 1380 [[Ferdinand I of Portugal|Ferdinand I]] established a shipping company (''[[Companhia das Naus]]''), with a compulsory insurance scheme, whereby member-merchants (essentially all shipowners and merchants outfitting ships above 50t) to contribute a fixed rate of 2% of freight revenue as a premium to a central fund (''Bolsa de Seguros''), from which claim payouts would be redistributed. Around 1488, [[Pedro de Santar\u00e9m]] (''Petrus Santerna''), a Portuguese consul in Italy, wrote perhaps the first treatise, ''De assecurationibus'' (published 1552\u201353), outlining the theory and principles behind marine insurance. Around 1578, [[Henry, King of Portugal|Cardinal-King Henry]] established the ''Consulado'', a tribunal explicitly dedicated to decide marine insurance cases (initially suppressed by the [[Iberian Union]] of 1580, the tribunal was resurrected by [[Philip II of Spain]] in 1593, with the modification that a private marine insurance contract had to have the signature of a royal official (''comiss\u00e1rio de seguros''), to be valid in the law courts). This formed the framework for marine insurance in which the India Armadas operated.  Later developments include the establishment of an insurance house (''Casa de Seguros'')  as an organ of the ''Junta do Com\u00e9rcio Geral'' (Board of General Trade) by regent-prince [[Peter II of Portugal]] in 1668, subsequently replaced by the ''Mesa do Bem Comum do Com\u00e9rcio (''Board of Common Trade Welfare) in 1720. Around 1750, the [[Sebasti\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 de Carvalho e Melo, Marquis of Pombal|Marquis de Pombal]] persuaded the monarch to fold the older house into a new entity, the ''Real Junta do Com\u00e9rcio'' (Royal Board of Trade). (DeSouza, 1977).</ref>\n\n===Ships===\n\n[[File:Armada portugaise.jpg|thumb|250px|Carracks of the India Armada of 1507, from the ''Livro de Lisuarte de Abreu'']]\nThe ships of an India armada were typically [[carracks]] (''naus''), with sizes that grew over time. The first carracks were modest ships, rarely exceeding 100-tonnes, carrying only up to 40\u201360 men, e.g. the [[S\u00e3o Gabriel (ship)|''S\u00e3o Gabriel'']] of [[Vasco da Gama|Gama's]] 1497 fleet, one of the largest of the time, was only 120t. But this was quickly increased as the India run got underway. In the 1500 [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral|Cabral]] armada, the largest carracks, Cabral's flagship and the ''El-Rei'', are reported to have been somewhere between 240t and 300t. The ''[[Frol de la mar|Flor de la Mar]]'', built in 1502, was a 400t nau, while at least one of the naus of the [[Afonso de Albuquerque|Albuquerque]] armada of 1503 is reported to have been as large as 600t. The rapid doubling and tripling of the size of Portuguese carracks in a few years reflected the needs of the India runs. The rate of increase tapered off thereafter. For much of the remainder of the 16th century, the average carrack on the India run was probably around 400t.\n\nIn the 1550s, during the reign of [[John III of Portugal|John III]], a few 900t behemoths were built for India runs, in the hope that larger ships would provide [[economies of scale]]. The experiment turned out poorly. Not only was the cost of outfitting such a large ship disproportionately high, they proved unmaneouverable and unseaworthy, particularly in the treacherous waters of the [[Mozambique Channel]]. Three of the new behemoths were quickly lost on the southern African coast \u2013 the ''S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o'' (900t, built 1550, wrecked 1552), the ''S\u00e3o Bento'' (900t, built 1551, wrecked 1554) and the largest of them all, the ''Nossa Senhora da Gra\u00e7a'' (1,000t, built 1556, wrecked 1559).<ref>Matthew (1988: pp. 266\u2013268); Castro (2005: p. 58)</ref>\n\n[[Image:Rela\u00e7\u00e3o da muy notavel perda do Gale\u00e3o Grande S. Jo\u00e3o.jpg|thumb|left|180px| Wreck of the ''S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o'', a large 900t India carrack (or great galleon), off the coast of South Africa, 1552.]]These kind of losses prompted King [[Sebastian of Portugal|Sebastian]] to issue an ordinance in 1570 setting the upper limit to the size of India naus at 450t.<ref>Castro (2005: p. 58)</ref>  Nonetheless, after the [[Iberian Union]] of 1580, this regulation would be ignored and shipbuilders, probably urged on by merchants hoping to turn around more cargo on every trip, pushed for larger ships. The size of India naus accelerated again, averaging 600t in the 1580\u20131600 period, with several spectacularly large naus of 1500t or greater making their appearance in the 1590s.\n\nIf the lesson was not quite learned then, it was certainly learned in August, 1592, when English [[privateer]] [[Sir John Burroughs]] (alt. Burrows, Burgh) the ''[[Madre de Deus]]'' in the waters around the [[Azores]] islands (see [[Battle of Flores (1592)|Battle of Flores]]). The ''Madre de Deus'', built in 1589, was a 1600t carrack, with seven decks and a crew of around 600. It was the largest Portuguese ship to go on an India run. The great carrack, under the command of Fern\u00e3o de Mendon\u00e7a Furtado, was returning from [[Cochin]] with a full cargo when it was captured by Burrough. The value of the treasure and cargo taken on this single ship is estimated to have been equivalent to half the entire treasury of the English crown. The loss of so much cargo in one swoop confirmed, once again, the folly of building such gigantic ships.<ref>Castro, ibid; Kingsford (1912)</ref> The carracks built for the India run returned to their smaller ideal size after the turn of the century.<ref>Castro, ibid.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Caravela Vera Cruz a entrar no Porto de Pipas, festas S\u00e3o Joaninas, 2008, Angra do Hero\u00edsmo, ilha Terceira, A\u00e7ores.JPG|thumb|right|150px| Modern replica of a lateen-rigged [[caravel]]]]\nIn the early ''Carreira da India'', the carracks were usually accompanied by smaller [[caravels]] (''caravelas''), averaging 50t\u201370t (rarely reaching 100t), and capable of holding 20\u201330 men at most. Whether [[Lateen|lateen-rigged]] (''{{lang|pt|latina}}'') or [[square rig|square-rigged]] (''[[Square Rigged Caravel|redonda]]''), these shallow-drafted, nimble vessels had a myriad of uses. Caravels served as forward lamp, scouts and fighting ships of the convoy. Caravels on the India run were often destined to remain overseas for coastal patrol duty, rather than return with the main fleet.\n\nIn the course of the 16th century, caravels were gradually phased out in favor of a new escort/fighting ship, the [[galleon]] (''gale\u00e3o''), which could range anywhere between 100t and 1000t. Based on the design of the [[carrack]], but slenderer and lower, with forecastle diminished or removed to make way for its famous 'beak', the galleon became the principal fighting ship of the India fleet. It was not as nimble as the caravel, but could be mounted with much more cannon, thus packing a bigger punch. With the introduction of the galleon, carracks became almost exclusively cargo ships (which is why they were pushed to such large sizes), leaving any fighting to be done to the galleons. One of the largest and most famous of Portuguese galleons was the ''[[Botafogo (galleon)|S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Baptista]]'' (nicknamed ''Botafogo'', 'spitfire'), a 1,000-ton galleon built in 1534, said to have carried 366 guns.\n\nMany fleets also brought small supply ships on outward voyage. These were destined to be scuttled along the way once the supplies were consumed. The crews were redistributed and the abandoned ships usually burned to recover their iron nails and fittings.\n\nAverage speed of an India Armada was around 2.5 [[Knot (unit)|knots]], but some ships could achieve speeds of between 8 and 10 for some stretches.\n\n===Seaworthiness===\n\nPortuguese India ships distinguished themselves from the ships of other navies (especially those of rival powers in the Indian Ocean) on two principal accounts: their seaworthiness (durability at sea) and their artillery.\n\nWith a few exceptions (e.g. ''[[Frol de la mar|Flor de la Mar]]'', ''[[Santa Catarina do Monte Sinai]]''), Portuguese India naus were not typically built to last longer than four or five years of useful service.   That a nau managed to survive a single India run was already an achievement, given that few ships of any nation at the time were able to stay at sea for even a quarter as long without breaking apart at the seams.\n\nThe success of the India nau depended on 15th-century innovations in Portuguese shipbuilding that greatly improved the seaworthiness and longevity of the ship. Notable among these were the use of iron nails (rather than wooden pegs) to hold planks, the mixing of [[lead]] in the seams, and a [[caulking]] technique that improved upon traditional [[oakum]] with 'galagala' paste (a mixture of oakum, [[Lime (fruit)|lime]] and [[olive oil]], producing a kind of putty that could be pressed between the planks). Hulls were amply coated in [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]] and pine [[tar]] (imported in bulk amounts from northern Germany), giving the India naus their famous (and, to some observers, sinister) dark tone.<ref>see [[Black Ships]]</ref>\n\n===Artillery===\n[[File:Falconete Museu Marinha Lisboa.jpg|thumb|right|Portuguese breech-loading ''falconete'', reign of King Sebastian]]\n[[Naval artillery#Transition|Naval artillery]] was the single greatest advantage the Portuguese held over their rivals in the Indian Ocean \u2013 indeed over most other navies \u2013 and the Portuguese crown spared no expense in procuring and producing the best naval guns European technology permitted.\n\nKing [[John II of Portugal]], while still a prince in 1474, is often credited for pioneering the introduction of a reinforced deck on the old Henry-era [[caravel]] to allow the mounting of heavy guns.<ref>Rodrigues and Tevezes (2009: p. 193)</ref>  In 1489, he introduced the first standardized teams of trained naval gunners (''bombardeiros'') on every ship, and development of naval tactics that maximized broadside cannonades rather than the rush-and-grapple of Medieval [[galleys]].\n\nThe Portuguese crown appropriated the best cannon technology available in Europe, particularly the new, more durable and far more accurate [[bronze]] cannon developed in Central Europe, replacing the older, less accurate [[wrought-iron]] cannon. By 1500, Portugal was importing vast volumes of [[copper]] and cannon from northern Europe, and had established itself as the leading producer of advanced naval artillery in its own right. Being a crown industry, cost considerations did not curb the pursuit of the best quality, best innovations and best training.<ref>Rodrigues and Tevezes (2009: p. 263) emphasize its importance as a crown industry \u2013 the coincidence between the producer and consumer of the product. Portuguese naval artillery was rarely faulty or exploded from misuse, not only because of crown self-interest in quality during production, but also because defective domestic pieces (unlike imported ones) were easy to fix or replace locally.</ref> The crown paid wage premiums and bonuses to lure the best European artisans and gunners (mostly German) to advance the industry in Portugal. Every cutting-edge innovation introduced elsewhere was immediately appropriated into Portuguese naval artillery \u2013 that includes bronze cannon (Flemish/German), breech-loading swivel-guns (prob. German origin), truck carriages (possibly English), and the idea (originally French, c. 1501<ref>Cipolla (1965)</ref>) of cutting square [[gun port]]s (''portinhola'') in the hull to allow heavy cannon to be mounted below deck.<ref>Rodrigues and Tevezes (2009: pp. 260\u2013264)</ref>\n\nIn this respect, the Portuguese spearheaded the evolution of modern naval warfare, moving away from the Medieval warship, a carrier of armed men, aiming for the grapple, towards the modern idea of a floating artillery piece dedicated to resolving battles by gunnery alone.\n\nAccording to Gaspar Correia, the typical fighting caravel of Gama's [[4th Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1502)|4th Armada]] (1502) carried 30 men, four heavy guns below, six [[Falconet (cannon)|falconets]] (''falconete'') above (two fixed astern) and ten [[Swivel gun|swivel-guns]] (''canh\u00e3o de ber\u00e7o'') on the quarter-deck and bow.\n\nAn armed carrack, by contrast, had six heavy guns below, eight falconets above and several swivel-guns, and two fixed forward-firing guns before the mast.<ref>Correa, in Stanley, p. 367</ref>  Although an armed carrack carried more firepower than a caravel, it was much less swift and less manoeuvrable, especially when loaded with cargo. A carrack's guns were primarily defensive, or for shore bombardments, whenever their heavier firepower was necessary. But by and large, fighting at sea was usually left to the armed caravels. The development of the heavy galleon removed even the necessity of bringing carrack firepower to bear in most circumstances.\n\n===Losses===\n[[File:Nau de Rui Vaz Pereira levantada por um monstro marino, armada de 1520. Livro de Lisuarte de Abreu.jpg|thumb|right|Sea-monster depicted in the ''Livro de Lisarte de Abreu'']]\n\nAccording to historian Oliveira Martins, of the 806 naus sent on the India Run between 1497 and 1612, 425 returned safely to Portugal, 20 returned prematurely (i.e. without reaching India), 66 were lost, 4 were captured by the enemy, 6 were scuttled and burnt, and 285 remained in India (which went on to meet various fates of their own in the East.)\n\nThe loss rate was higher in certain periods than others, reflecting greater or lesser attention and standards of shipbuilding, organization, supervision, training, etc. which reveals itself in shoddily-built ships, overloaded cargo, incompetent officers, as well as the expected higher dangers of wartime. The rates fluctuated dramatically. By one estimate, in 1571\u20131575, 90% of India ships returned safely; by 1586\u20131590, the success rate fell to less than 40%; between 1596 and 1605, the rate climbed above 50% again, but in the subsequent years fell back to around 20%.<ref name=\"Guinote 1999\"/>\n\nThat only four ships on India runs were known to be captured by the enemy seems quite astonishing. These were:\n\n*(1) 1508, the ship of J\u00f3 Queimado, originally part of the 8th Portuguese India Armada (Cunha, 1506) of [[Trist\u00e3o da Cunha]] that set out in 1506. It was captured in 1508 by the French corsair Mondragon (said by one account to be in the [[Mozambique Channel]], but it is unlikely Mondragon would have taken the trouble of doubling the [[Cape of Good Hope|Cape]]; it was more likely captured on the Atlantic side, probably near the [[Azores]]). Mondragon was himself tracked down and taken prisoner by [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] in January, 1509, off [[Cape Finisterre]].\n*(2) 1525, ''[[Santa Catarina do Monte Sinai]]'', the great carrack built in [[Goa]] in 1512. It had been used to carry [[Vasco da Gama]] in 1523 to serve as the new [[List of colonial heads of Portuguese India|viceroy of India]], and was on its way back to Portugal in 1525, with the former governor D. [[Duarte de Menezes]], when it was taken by French corsairs. (However, some have speculated that there was no foreign attack, that Menezes himself simply decided to go [[pirate|piratical]] and took command of the ship.)\n*(3) 1587, ''S\u00e3o Filipe'', returning from an India run, was captured by English privateer Sir [[Francis Drake]], off [[the Azores]]. The triumph of the ''S\u00e3o Filipe'' cargo, one of the wealthiest hoards ever captured, was overshadowed only by the even wealthier trove of paperwork and maps detailing the Portuguese trade in Asia which fell into English hands. This set in motion the first English expedition to India, under Sir [[James Lancaster]] in 1591.\n*(4) 1592 ''Madre de Deus'', the gigantic carrack captured by [[Sir John Burroughs]] near the Azores, already described above.\n\nThis does not count, of course, ships that were attacked by enemy action and subsequently capsized or destroyed. It also does not count ships that were captured later in the East Indies (i.e. not on the India route at the time). The most famous of these was probably the mighty Portuguese carrack [[Santa Catarina (ship)|''Santa Catarina'']] (not to be confused with its earlier ''Mount Sinai'' namesake), captured in 1603, by Dutch captain [[Jacob van Heemskerk]]. The ''Santa Catarina'' was on a [[Portuguese Macau]] to [[Portuguese Malacca]] run with a substantial cargo of Sino-Japanese wares, most notably a small fortune in [[musk]], when it was captured by Heemskerk in [[Singapore]]. The captured cargo nearly doubled the capital of the fledgling [[Dutch East India Company|Dutch VOC]].\n\nShips losses should not be confused with crew losses from disease, deprivation, accident, combat and desertion. These tended to be horrifically high \u2013 one third, or even as much as one half, even in good years.\n\n===Crews===\n[[File:Portuguese Discoveries and Empire Flag.svg|thumb|right| The banner of the [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Order of Christ]] became a popular, and de facto, naval and war ensign amongst captains below the rank of Viceroy (who flew the royal banner), since many notable Portuguese captains belonged to that order.]]\nThe admiral of an armada, necessarily a nobleman of some degree, was known as the ''capit\u00e3o-mor'' (captain-major), with full jurisdiction over the fleet. There was also usually a designated ''soto-capit\u00e3o'' (vice-admiral), with a commission to assume command should tragedy befall the captain-major. The vice-admirals were also useful if a particular armada needed to be split into separate squadrons. If an armada carried a [[List of colonial heads of Portuguese India|viceroy or governor of the Indies]], he typically assumed the senior position (although in practice many delegated the decision-making during the journey to their flagship's captain).\n\nEach India ship had a ''capit\u00e3o'' ([[Captain (nautical)|captain]]). As the position of captain could be quite profitable, it became quite attractive to lesser nobles and men of ambition hoping for a quick and easy fortune.   The crown was often happy to 'sell' captain positions on India runs as a form of royal patronage to candidates with little or no experience at sea. Nonetheless, the captain was formally the king's representative and highest authority on his ship. Everyone, even noble passengers of greater formal rank, were under his jurisdiction. The supremacy of a captain's authority was curtailed only if the captain-major came aboard his ship, and when he docked in [[Goa]] (jurisdiction passed to the [[List of colonial heads of Portuguese India|Vice-Roy or Governor]]).\n\nAnother important figure on an India ship was the ''escriv\u00e3o'' ([[Captain's clerk|clerk]]), the ''de facto'' royal agent. The clerk was in charge of the written record of everything on the ship, especially the cargo inventory, which he tracked with meticulous precision. The clerk was carefully screened by the [[Casa da \u00cdndia]], and was the crown's most trusted agent on board ship, and expected to keep an eye for crown interests. This gave him, in practice, a greater authority on the ship than his formal title suggests. At departure, the clerk was presented with the keys to the ''por\u00e3o'' ([[Hold (ship)|hold]]) and a [[Seal (emblem)|royal signet]] to seal the cargo. Nobody, not even the captain, was allowed to visit the cargo hold without the clerk present. It is said that rations could not be distributed, nor even a cup of water drawn from a barrel, without notifying the clerk. Upon the capture of an enemy ship, the clerk was immediately escorted aboard the captured vessel to seal the holds, cabins and chests, and take inventory of the loot.\n\nTechnical command of the ship was in the hands of the ''piloto'' (who combined the roles of [[Maritime pilot|pilot]] and [[navigator]]) and his assistant, the ''soto-piloto'' (second or under-pilot). The pilot and his assistant not merely steered the ship, but were responsible for all navigational matters \u2013 charts, instruments, plotting the course, etc. As captains were often quite inexperienced, the pilot was usually the highest trained naval officer aboard. Captains frequently deferred to them on the running of the ship.\n\nLacking a formal navigation school, early pilots were trained by [[apprenticeship]]. New pilots received their instruction, both practical and theoretical,  first-hand from master pilots aboard ship and kept a tight lid on their professional secrets.<ref>In his ''Tratado que...fez em defens\u00e3o da carta de marear, Co' regimento de altura'' (1537), the ''comosgrafo-mor'' (chief cosmographer) [[Pedro Nunes]] chides the India pilots for their reluctance to instruct or seek instruction formally.</ref>  This changed in the late 1550s or early 1560s, with the establishment of formal courses of instruction for India pilots in Lisbon by the ''cosm\u00f3grafo-mor'' [[Pedro Nunes]], which included a final examination and formal certification.<ref>Although still holding his mathematics chair in [[University of Coimbra|Coimbra]] until 1562, Pedro Nunes began spending extended periods in Lisbon in the late 1550s.  Details of Pedro Nunes's 'navigation courses' are scanty.  It is believed the course was carried on after Nunes's death in 1578 by his successors Thomaz Orta and [[Jo\u00e3o Baptista Lavanha]].  See Sousa Viterbo (1897). Diffie and Winius (p. 142).</ref>\n\n[[File:Mariner's astrolabe.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The [[mariner's astrolabe]] was developed shortly before 1500 and found its first use in early Portuguese India Armadas]]\nDespite their general secretiveness, several early India pilots compiled written navigation manuals, probably initially merely as notes for themselves, but eventually passed on and copied by others.  These included general instructions on how to read, plot and follow routes by nautical chart, how to use the principal nautical instruments of the day \u2013 the  mariner's [[compass]], the [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]], the [[astrolabe]], the [[Nocturnal (instrument)|nocturlabe]] and the ''balestilha'' ([[cross-staff]]) \u2013 and astronomical tables (notably that of solar declination, derived from [[Abraham Zacuto]] and later Pedro Nunes's own) to correctly account for \"compass error\" (the deviation of the [[magnetic north]] from the [[true north]]) by recourse to the [[Pole Star]], [[Sun]] and [[Southern Cross]], the flux and reflux of [[tides]], etc.  These manuals often contained a ''roteiro'' ([[rutter (nautical)|rutter]]), giving the detailed instructions (by geographical coordinates and physical description) of the routes to India.  Two of the few which have survived were [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]]'s ''Esmeraldo de Situ Orbis'' (c. 1509) and  [[Jo\u00e3o de Lisboa]]'s ''Livro da Marinharia'' (c. 1514).<ref>Other famous rutters of the India run include those by [[Andr\u00e9 Pires]] (c. 1530), [[Diogo Afonso]] (c. 1536), [[Jo\u00e3o de Castro]] (1538\u20131541), [[Manuel de \u00c1lvares]] (1545), [[P\u00earo Vaz Fargosa]] (1560), [[Vicente Rodrigues]] (1575, 1591) and, perhaps most famous of all, the 1595 Dutch edition by [[Jan Huyghen van Linschoten]]. (Matthew, 1988)</ref>\n\nRelative to the ships of other nations (e.g. French, Dutch), clerks and pilots on Portuguese vessels held an unusually high degree of authority.\n\nNext in a ship's hierarchy was the ''mestre'' ([[Master (naval)|master]]). The ship's master was the officer in charge of all sailors, ship's boys and the rest of the crew. His primary job at sea was to ensure the crew implemented the technical manoeuvre orders of the pilot \u2013 raising and lowering sails, etc. As such, the master required a good degree of sailing knowledge \u2013 knowing how to translate the pilot's instructions into sail & crew instructions. He was often sufficiently trained in navigation to take over pilot's duties if the pilot and under-pilot were incapacitated. But a ship which lost all three officers would usually be in serious trouble.\n\n[[Image:Portuguese Nau.png|thumb|230px| Portuguese carrack]]\nAssisting the master, was the ''contramestre'' (or ''soto-mestre'', [[boatswain]]). The boatswain was the crew enforcer \u2013 he ensured the master's orders were implemented by the crew. In practice, they usually partitioned the deck between them, with the master in charge of implementation in the [[stern]], and the boatswain in the [[bow (ship)|bow]]. The boatswain was also in charge of the maintenance of rigging, anchors and supervising the loading and unloading of cargo, etc. The boatswain had his own assistant, the ''guardi\u00e3o'' (boatswain's mate).\n\nThe bulk of the crew were all-purpose sailors \u2013 usually half of them ''marinheiros'' (seamen), the other half ''grumetes'' (ship-boys). The partition between the two classes was akin to the modern distinction between [[able seaman]] and [[Ordinary Seaman (occupation)|ordinary seamen]], e.g. ship-boys were assigned the drudgery duties, swabbing and scrubbing, moving cargo, etc., while seamen would be given 'higher' responsibilities, e.g. assigned to hold the wheel on the ''tolda'' ([[quarterdeck]]). The boatswain was considered the head of the seamen, and served as the intermediary between the seamen and the higher officers (master, pilot, etc.). The boatswain's mate had authority only over the ship-boys; seamen would not obey a boatswain's mate's order.<ref>Hutter (2005: p. 180)</ref>\n\nThen there were the specialized crew. A Portuguese India nau usually had two ''estrinqueiros'', skilled sailors in charge of the [[windlass]] that operated the round [[Mast (sailing)|sails]] (one for the main mast, another for the fore mast). The ''meirinho'' ([[bailiff]]), a judicial officer, was in charge of dispensing punishment and supervising on-board dangers (fires, gunpowder stores, weapon caches). The ''capel\u00e3o'' ([[chaplain]]) was in charge of saving souls, the ''barbeiro'' ([[barber surgeon]]) in charge of saving lives. A large nau usually had a number of ''pagens'' ([[Page (occupation)|pages]]), who not only attended upon the officers and the cabins, but also served as runners delivering orders across the deck.\n\nThe ''despenseiro'' ([[purser]]/[[Chief Steward|steward]]) was in charge of food stores and rations. Unlike ships of other nations, Portuguese vessels did not usually have a cook aboard, sailors were expected to cook their own meals themselves at the ship's ovens.<ref>Hutter (2005: p. 177)</ref> Rations were composed primarily of [[ship biscuit]] (the main staple, rationed at 2&nbsp;lb per person per day). Other provisions included wine, salt, olive oil, salted cod, sardines, pork, cheese, rice, and the like, with fresh fruits and vegetables available on the initial part of the journey.  Rations were suspended if the ship was at dock and the men ashore. On the return journey, the crown would only supply enough biscuit and water for a ship to reach the Cape of Good Hope; the ship's crew would have to find its own provisions thereafter.<ref>Matthew, 1988: p. 250</ref>\n\nPerhaps the most valued of the specialized positions was the repair crew. This was usually composed of two ''carpinteiros'' ([[carpenter]]s ) and two ''calafate'' (caulkers) that fixed anything that was broken, plus the ''tanoeiro'' ([[Cooper (profession)|cooper]]), who ensured the cargo and water stores remained preserved. A nau might also have ''mergulhadores'' (divers), crew specially trained to go down the outside of the ship to check and help repair hull damage below the water level.\n\nMilitary personnel aboard a nau varied with the mission. Except for some specialists and passengers, most of the crew was armed before encounters and expected to fight. But every nau also had, at the very least, a small specialized [[Naval artillery|artillery]] crew of around ten ''bombardeiros'' (gunners), under the command of a ''condest\u00e1vel'' ([[constable]]). As naval artillery was the single most important advantage the Portuguese had over rival powers in the Indian Ocean, gunners were highly trained and enjoyed a bit of an elite status on the ship. (Indeed, many gunners on Portuguese India ships were highly skilled foreigners, principally Germans, lured into Portuguese service with premium wages and bonuses offered by crown agents.<ref>Rodrigues and Tevezes (2009: p. 263)</ref>)\n\nShips that expected more military encounters might also carry ''homens d'armas'' ([[Man-at-arms|men-at-arms]]), ''espingardeiros'' ([[arquebusier]]s/[[musketeer]]s) and ''besteiros'' ([[crossbowmen]]). But, except for the gunners, soldiers aboard ship were not regarded as an integral part of the naval crew, but rather just as passengers.\n\nThe following is a sample composition of a typical 16th-century Portuguese India nau ([[carrack]]):<ref>Castro (2005: p. 63)</ref>\n*1 captain (capit\u00e3o)\n*1 clerk (''escriv\u00e3o'')\n*1 chaplain (''capel\u00e3o'')\n*2 pilots (''piloto'', ''soto-piloto'')\n*1 master (''mestre'')\n*1 boatswain (''contramestre'')\n*1 boatswain's mate (''guardi\u00e3o'')\n*2 windlass operators (''estrinqueiros'')\n*45 seamen (''marinheiros'')\n*48 ship-boys (''grumetes'')\n*4 pages (''pagems'')\n*2 carpenters (''carpinteiro'' and ''carpinteiro sobressalente'')\n*2 caulkers (''calafate'' and ''calafate sobressalente'')\n*1 cooper (''tanoeiro'')\n*1 steward (''despenseiro'')\n*1 bailiff (''meirinho'')\n*1 barber-surgeon (''barbeiro'')\n*1 constable (''condest\u00e1vel'')\n*11 gunners (''bombardeiros'')\n\nTotal = 127 crew\n\nPlus any soldiers and passengers that might be taken aboard.\n\n===Compensation and spoils===\nIn addition to the cash salaries paid by the [[Casa da \u00cdndia]], captains and crew members were allowed to engage in trade on their own account (up to a certain amount). That is, they were authorized to import into Portugal a pre-specified volume of pepper and a certain number of boxes of assorted goods (''caixas forras de fretes e direitos'', or ''caixas de liberdades'', \"liberty chests\"). These were to be purchased in India out of their own pockets, of course, but the crown would allow these cargoes to be brought back on crown ships free of freight charge and duties, and sold in Lisbon markets (at pre-set prices), for their own personal profit.  Liberty chests had standard dimensions 4' \u00d7 3' \u00d7 2.5' <ref>Matthew, 1988: p. 247</ref>\n\n[[File:Jeronimos-SouthFacade.jpg|270px|thumb|The [[Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery]], built on the profits of the India armadas]]\nIn the early armadas, the captain-major and captains of the carracks were obliged, by King [[Manuel I of Portugal]], to pay the ''vintena de Bel\u00e9m'', a 5% duty of the earnings from the private sales of imported goods for the construction and maintenance of the [[Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery]] in [[Santa Maria de Bel\u00e9m|Bel\u00e9m]]. This rule was introduced in 1502 and continued until about 1522.\n\nThe following compensation schedule is taken from the [[2nd Portuguese India Armada (Cabral, 1500)|Second India Armada]] of 1500<ref>As reported in Gaspar Correia's ''Lendas da India'', p. 147; Matthew (1988: p. 247) gives a different breakdown</ref>\n\n* captain-major: 10,000 cruzados for entire journey, 500 [[quintal]]s of pepper, 10 liberty chests\n* captain: 1,000 cruzados for each 100-tonne ship size they command, 50 quintals, 6 chests\n* pilot, master: 500 cruzados, 30 quintals, 4 chests\n* constable: 200 cruzados, 10 quintals, 2 chests\n* gunners: 10 cruzados per month, 10 quintals, 1 chest\n* soldiers: 5 cruzados per month, 3 quintals, 1 chest\n* sailors: 10 cruzados per month, 10 quintals, 1 chest\n* boatswain & boatswain's mate: 1 and a 1/3 times the sailor's salary.\n* specialized crew (chaplain, steward, barber-surgeon, carpenter, caulker, windlass-operator): 2/3 of the sailor's salary\n* ship-boys: 1/2 of the sailor's salary\n* pages: 1/4 of the sailor's salary\n\nThe ''Casa da India'' allowed the captain-major to draw as much as 5,000 cruzados of his salary in advance, a captain 1,000. Any married crewman could draw up to one year in salary in advance, while a single man could draw up to six months.\n\nOfficers, soldiers and officials that were to remain in India in some capacity (patrol ship captains, factors, clerks, magistrates (''[[alcaide]]-mor''), etc.) typically signed employment contracts of three years duration. Soldiers who signed an overseas service contract received a bonus of 800 ''[[Portuguese real|reais]]'' per month en route, bumped up to 1200 per month in India (to pay for living expenses),<ref>1 cruzado was between 324 and 400 reais</ref> and the right to ship back an additional 2.5 quintals of pepper per year (in addition to the quintals they were already authorized to send back according to the standard pay scale).<ref>See Barros, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BJ42AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA193#v=onepage&q&f=false pp. 193\u2013194]</ref>\n\nEven if not formally authorized, captains sometimes supplemented their earnings by undertaking a bit of piracy and extortion on the side. Although it did not necessarily encourage India armadas to pursue activities that might endanger their ships and cargoes, rules were still set out for the partition of the spoils of captured ships and extortion of tribute from 'unfriendly' ports.\n\nThe rules of plunder were as follows: first of all, the captain-major has the 'right to a jewel', i.e. he is allowed to pick one item from the spoils for himself, provided it is worth no more than 500 cruzados. Then one-fifth is set aside for the crown. The remainder is subsequently divided into three parts: 2/3 for the crown again (albeit to be expended on the armada itself in the form of equipment, supplies and ammunition), and the remaining third distributed among the crew for private taking. The partition of this last third worked out as follows:<ref>Fonseca (1908: p. 201)</ref>\n\n*Captain-major: 15 parts\n*captains of the large carracks: 10 parts\n*Captains of caravels: 6 parts\n*Pilot-Master (i.e. those who served double office of pilot & master): 4 parts\n*Masters: 3 parts\n*Pilots: 3 parts\n*Sailors: 2 parts\n*Gunners: 2 parts\n*''Espingardeiros'' (arquebusiers/musketeers): 2 parts\n*Crossbowmen: 2 parts\n*Armed sailors: 1.5 parts\n*Men-at-arms: 1.5 parts\n*Ship boys: 1 part\n\nOnce again, the captain-major and captains of large carracks had to contribute 10% of their part to the [[Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery]] of Bel\u00e9m (although that does not seem to apply to the others).\n\n==The India Trade==\n\n===Cargo===\nWhile the India armadas were used to ferry troops, officials, missionaries and colonists between Europe and Asia, their primary objective was commercial. They were engaged in the spice trade, importing Asian spices to sell in European markets, especially the five \"glorious spices\" \u2013 pepper, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and mace.\n\n{|cellpadding=3 cellspacing=0 style=\"margin:5px; border:1px solid;\" | style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ '''The Glorious Spices'''\n|-\n|[[File:BlackPeppercorns.JPG|150px|[[Black pepper|Pepper]]]]||[[File:Canelle Cinnamomum burmannii Luc Viatour crop1.jpg|150px| [[Cinnamon]]]] || [[File:ClovesDried.jpg|150px|[[Clove]]]] || [[File:Muscade.jpg|150px|[[Nutmeg]]]] || [[File:Fleur de muscade.jpg|150px|[[Mace (spice)]]]]\n|-\n| [[Black Pepper|Pepper]] || [[Cinnamon]] || [[Cloves]] || [[Nutmeg]] || [[Mace (spice)|Mace]]\n|-\n| ([[Kerala]]) || ([[Ceylon]]) || ([[Ternate]] & [[Tidore]]) || ([[Banda Islands]]) || ([[Banda Islands]])\n|}\n\n[[Black Pepper]], grown locally in [[Kerala]], composed as much as 90% of the return cargo of the early armadas. But the other glorious spices could also be found in [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], [[Cochin]] and other major markets on the [[Malabar coast]] of India \u2013 [[cinnamon]] was imported in large amounts from [[Ceylon]], while, from further east, via [[Portuguese Malacca|Malacca]], came [[long pepper]] (from [[Java]]), [[cloves]] (grown exclusively in the [[Moluccas|Moluccan]] islands of [[Ternate]] and [[Tidore]]) and, in smaller amounts, highly valued [[nutmeg|nutmeg and mace]] (grown only in the [[Banda Islands]]).\n\nThe armadas also loaded less glorious spices found in Indian markets, notably locally-grown [[ginger]] (the principal 'filler' cargo), [[cardamom]] and [[tamarind]], balms and aromatics like [[Artemisia (plant)|''Artemisia indica'']] (wormwood), [[Aloe perryi|Socotra aloe]], [[galbanum]], [[camphor]] and [[myrrh]]. Also brought back from India were dyes like [[lac]], [[indigo]] and [[dyewood]] and precious ornamental objects and materials like [[ivory]], [[ebony]] and [[pearl]]s.\n\nIt is estimated that the average India carrack brought back between 6,100 and 6,800 [[quintal]]s of imported spices and goods \u2013 or, around 25,000 to 30,000 quintals for the average yearly India armada (4\u20135 ships).  Exceptionally large armadas and/or behemoth ships could push it up to 40,000 in some years.<ref>Steensgard (1985: p. 23)</ref>  It is estimated that around 15% of the cargo was lost at sea, spoilage, etc. over the long run.\n\nA greater difficulty involved determining the cargo on the outgoing journey. The following list, from the [[4th Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1502)|Fourth Armada]] of 1502, gives an idea of the kind of European items brought by the Portuguese to sell in India: \"cut and branch [[Coral (precious)|coral]], [[copper]] in pigs and sheets, [[Mercury (element)|quicksilver]], [[vermilion]], rugs, Flanders brass basins, coloured cloths, knives, red barret-caps, mirrors and coloured [[silk]]s.\" <ref>(Danvers, 1894 p. 87).</ref> But, by and large, European products did not sell well in Asia, which meant that ship holds were frequently empty, or nearly so, on the outward leg. In other words, outbound ships carried little more than the metal bullion \u2013 principally [[silver]], but also [[copper]] and [[lead]] \u2013 needed to purchase spices in Asian markets.<ref>Newitt (2005: p. 70)</ref>\n\nHowever, if they stopped by [[Mozambique Island]] on the outward leg (as almost all India armadas did), they could expect the local Portuguese factors to have a stockpile of East African trade goods \u2013 gold, ivory, coral, pearls, acquired during the year at several points along the [[Swahili Coast]] \u2013 ready to be picked up by the armadas for sale in India.\n\n===Factories===\n[[Image:Portugues map of India, 1630.jpg|thumb|230px| Portuguese map of India, from 1630.]]\n\nOf course, an armada could not just sail into an Indian city and expect to find enough supplies at hand in the city's spice markets to load up five or ten large ships at once. Should it even try, it would likely provoke an instant scarcity and quickly drive up the prices of spices astronomically.\n\nInstead, the Portuguese relied on the ancient 'factory' system. That is, in every major market, the Portuguese erected a warehouse ('[[Factory (trading post)|factory]]', ''feitoria'') and left behind a purchasing agent ([[Factor (agent)|'factor']], ''feitor''). The factor and his assistants would remain in the city and buy spices from the markets slowly over the course of the year, and deposit them into the warehouse. When the next armada arrived, it would simply load up the accumulated spices from the warehouse and set sail out at once.\n\n[[File:Calicut 1572.jpg|left|thumb|City of [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], India, c. 1572 (from [[Georg Braun]] and Frans Hogenberg's atlas ''[[Civitates orbis terrarum]]'')]]\nThe first Portuguese factory in Asia was set up in [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] (''Calecute'', Kozhikode), the principal spice entrepot on the [[Malabar Coast]] of India in September 1500, but it was overrun in a riot a couple of months later. Consequently, the first lasting factory was set up in the nearby smaller city of [[Cochin]] (''Cochim'', Kochi) in late 1500. This was followed up by factories in [[Kannur|Cannanore]] (''Canonor'', Kannur) (1502) and [[Kollam|Quilon]] (''Coul\u00e3o'', Kollam) (1503).\n\nAlthough some Portuguese factories were defended by [[palisade]]s that eventually evolved into Portuguese [[fort]]s garrisoned by Portuguese troops (e.g. [[Fort Kochi|Fort Manuel]] was erected around the Cochin factory in 1503, [[St. Angelo Fort|Fort Sant' Angelo]] around the Cannanore factory in 1505), not all did. The two concepts are distinct. Factories were commercial outposts, not political, administrative or military. The factor was formally an employee of the ''Casa da \u00cdndia'' (the trading house), not an officer of the ''Estado da \u00cdndia'' (the colonial government).\n\n===Age of Antwerp===\n[[File:Armed Four-Master Putting Out to Sea from The Sailing Vessels MET DP818236.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Engraving of a Portuguese carrack, by Frans Huys circa 1555. Identifiable by the armillary sphere it flies as a banner]]\nWhile [[Lisbon]] was the offloading point of the India armada, it was not the endpoint of the Portuguese [[spice trade]]. There remained the matter of distribution of the spices in Europe.\n\nUntil the Portuguese breakthrough into the Indian Ocean, the supply of eastern spices to European consumers had been largely in the hands of [[Republic of Venice]]. Arab and Gujarati merchants ferried spices from Indian ports like [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], across the [[Arabian Sea]] and into the [[Red Sea]] ports like [[Jeddah]]. From there, they would be carried overland to ports in the eastern [[Mediterranean]], such as [[Alexandria]], where they would be picked by Venetian merchants and then sold on European markets.\n\nThe Portuguese India armadas challenged this old spice route, for a brief period disrupted it, but they did not eliminate it. Despite Portuguese efforts to secure monopolies at the source, enough spices still slipped through the old Venetian-Arab route and forced competition on the sale end in Europe.\n\n[[File:City of Antwerp, 1572.jpg|thumb|City of [[Antwerp]], 1572 (from [[Georg Braun]] and Frans Hogenberg's atlas ''[[Civitates orbis terrarum]]'')]]\nRealizing that the Mediterranean was saturated with spices supplied by Venetian merchants, the Portuguese decided to avoid head-to-head competition that might cut into their profits there, and focused on selling their spices in northern Europe, a market the Venetians had barely touched. To this end, the Casa da \u00cdndia set up a factory (''feitoria de Flandres'') in the [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabantine]] town of [[Antwerp]] in 1508. The factory had two purposes: firstly, to serve as a distribution center of the Portuguese spices to the rest of northern Europe; secondly, to acquire the silver bullion needed by the Portuguese India armadas to buy spices in Asia.\n\nIt is in the silver trade that Portugal and Venice competed directly. Both needed large volumes of European silver to buy spices in Asia, yet the only significant silver source was in Central Europe, dominated by major German trading families like the [[Welser]]s, the [[Hochstetter]]s and the [[Fuggers]] of [[Augsburg]]. To get their hands on this silver, the Portuguese and Venetians offered gold, not only from their revenues of spice sales, but also from overseas sources: the Portuguese had access to gold from the [[Akan people|Akan]] fields on the [[Portuguese Gold Coast|Gold Coast]] of west Africa, while the Venetians had access to the gold mines of the [[Sudan]] (which was freighted up the [[Nile]] to [[Alexandria]]). Via river routes, the German silver merchants directed silver bullion supplies up to the Portuguese factory in Antwerp, from where ships would carry them to Lisbon, to be loaded onto the India armadas.\n\nThe intercontinental streams of spices, gold and silver flowing in and out of the Portuguese factory transformed Antwerp overnight from a sleepy town into arguably the leading commercial and financial center of Europe in the 16th century, a position it would enjoy until its [[Sack of Antwerp|sack by mutinous Spanish soldiers]] in 1576.\n\nRecent research has shown that, after 1505, most of the trade that moved between Lisbon and Antwerp sidestepped the Portuguese royal \"factory of Flanders\".  Most of the European leg of the trade was directly contracted between the ''Casa da \u00cdndia'' in Lisbon and private foreign consortiums (usually Italian and German) in Antwerp and freighted largely by Dutch, Hanseatic and Breton ships.  As a result, the bulk of the profits of the Portuguese spice trade accrued not to the Portuguese crown, but to the private consortiums (Smith calculates that, in 1517\u20131519, as much as half the price difference for spices between Indian and European markets was pocketed by private European merchants on this leg; by 1585, the share reaped by the Portuguese crown had fallen to a mere 15%).<ref>Smith (2008)</ref>\n\n==The End==\n\nDue to a series of costly losses in the 1550s, the ''Casa da \u00cdndia'' fell into severe financial straits and was basically bankrupt by 1560. In 1570, King [[Sebastian of Portugal]] issued a decree revoking the royal monopoly, and opening up trade with India to any private Portuguese merchant. As few took up the offer, the free trade decree was replaced in 1578 by a new system of annual monopolies, whereby the ''Casa'' sold the rights of the India trade to a private merchant consortium, guaranteeing them a monopoly for one year.  The annual monopoly system was abandoned in 1597, and the royal monopoly resumed.  But by that time, everything had changed.\n[[File:Iberian_mare_clausum_claims.svg|thumb|left|350px|Portugal claimed the Indian Ocean as its ''[[mare clausum]]'' during the [[Age of Discovery]].]]\nFor an entire century, the Portuguese had managed to monopolize the India run.  The spice trade itself was not monopolized \u2013 through the 16th century, the [[Republic of Venice]] had kept up its competition through its overland Levantine routes \u2013 but the sea route by the Cape remained exclusively Portuguese.  Despite occasional leaks (e.g. the [[Cantino planisphere]] of 1502), details of the Portuguese ''Carreira da \u00cdndia'' had been largely kept secret, or at least was not exploited by competitors.  But this changed in the 1590s.\n\nThe capture of the Portuguese ship ''S\u00e3o Filipe'' by the English privateer Sir Francis Drake in 1587, with its [[rutter (nautical)|rutter]] and detailed maps, prompted the first English attempt to sail to the East Indies, a private three-ship fleet organized by London merchants, and led by Sir [[James Lancaster]].  It was a disaster \u2013 most of the ships and crews were lost, and Lancaster had to resort to piracy to fill his hold \u2013 but it opened the way.\n\nIn the Netherlands, the preacher and cartographer [[Petrus Plancius]] had long been urging his countrymen to set out on their own route, rather than relying on the Portuguese hauls.  The Dutch effort received an injection from the information provided by [[Cornelis de Houtman]], a Dutch spy dispatched to Lisbon in 1592 to scout the spice trade, and [[Jan Huyghen van Linschoten]], a Dutch sailor who had served on many Portuguese India armadas from the 1580s.  With this information in hand, the Dutch finally made their move in 1595, when a group of [[Amsterdam]] merchants formed the ''Compagnie van Verre'' and sent out their first expedition, under de Houtman, to the East Indies, aiming for the market port of [[Bantam (city)|Bantam]].  That same year, Linschoten published a little tract in Amsterdam entitled ''Reysgheschrift vande navigatien der Portugaloysers in Orienten'' (Travel Account of the Voyages of the Portuguese in the Orient),  a [[rutter (nautical)|rutter]] giving the details of the sailing directions of the Portuguese India Run.  It was republished in 1596, as part of a larger book, the ''Itinerario'', where Linschoten gave the details of the trade and the condition of Portuguese defenses in Asia.  It was an explosive sensation. It was immediately translated into English, German, Latin and soon French.\n\n1597 was the bellwether year \u2013 the year of Houtman's successful return, and the spread of Linschoten's tracts. A slate of new Dutch companies (''voorcompagnie'') to trade with the East Indies were immediately erected by various competing merchant consortiums in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Middelburg and elsewhere \u2013 often with the help of exiled Antwerp merchants ('Brabantsche'), who had long been involved on the distribution end of the Portuguese spice trade, but expelled due to the Dutch-Spanish conflict. At least fifteen separate Dutch expeditions to the East Indies, each involving enormous numbers of men, ships, and amounts of treasure, were sent out by the ''voorcompanies'' in 1598\u20131601. From this enthusiastic anarchic beginning, the Dutch trade got organized in 1601, when the Dutch government forced the voorcompagnie to fold under a single monopoly company, the ''[[Dutch East India Company|Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie]]'' (VOC).\n\nFearful of being left behind, the English had founded their own [[East India Company]] (EIC) in 1600, and managed to organize a small English expedition to Bantam in 1601, but enthusiasm was weaker and the EIC had problems competing with the better-organized and better-financed Dutch.\n\nThe vigorous [[Dutch East India Company|Dutch VOC]] and [[East India Company|English EIC]] encroachments on the [[Portuguese empire]] and trade in Asia, prompted the monarchy (then in [[Iberian Union]] with Spain) to experiment with different arrangements.  In 1624, [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip III of Portugal]] granted a monopoly charter to a Portuguese ''[[Portuguese East India Company|Companhia do comm\u00e9rcio da \u00cdndia]]'', a private joint-stock company organized on the same lines as the Dutch and English companies. The ''Companhia'' was to take over all the  responsibilities of the ''Casa da \u00cdndia'', including the annual India armada.<ref>Silva (1974); Disney (1977)</ref>  It proved to be a fiasco. The Anglo-Dutch breach of the Portuguese East Indies trade was irreparable by this time, squeezing profit margins and rendering the ''Companhia'' unprofitable.  It was liquidated in 1633, and what remained of the dwindling Portuguese India trade was brought back under the royal ''Casa da \u00cdndia''.\n\n==Sources==\nWhat seems like the first chronology of the Portuguese India armadas can be found in the magnificently illustrated codex known as the ''Livro de Lisuarte de Abreu'' (\"Book of Lisuarte de Abreu\", named after the man who ordered the compilation). It covers the period from Vasco da Gama's first trip (1497\u201399) to the end of 1563. It is conserved at the [[Pierpont Morgan Library]] in [[New York City]] (ms. 525).\n\nAnother codex of the same nature is the ''Mem\u00f3ria das Armadas que de Portugal passaram \u00e0 \u00cdndia'' (\"Memory of the Armadas that from Portugal passed to India\") or ''Livro das Armadas'', held by the [[Sciences Academy of Lisbon|Academia das Ci\u00eancias]] in [[Lisbon]]. It covers the period from 1497 to 1567 (although missing the armada of 1517).\n\nThe first Portuguese chronicler to attempt a systematic chronology of the India Armadas seems to have been [[Diogo do Couto]], in his appendix to [[Jo\u00e3o de Barros]]'s ''D\u00e9cadas da \u00c1sia'' (\"Decades of Asia\"), entitled \" \"De todas as Armadas que os Reys de Portugal mand\u00e1ram \u00e0 \u00cdndia, at\u00e9 que El-Rey D. Filippe succedeo nestes Reynos\", de 1497 a 1581\" (Dec X, Pt.1, Bk. 1, c.16).\n\nOther codices include \"''Rela\u00e7\u00e3o das N\u00e1os e Armadas da India com os Sucessos dellas que se puderam Saber, para Noticia e Instruc\u00e7\u00e3o dos Curiozos, e Amantes da Historia da India''\" (\"Relation of the Ships and Armadas of India\") (Codex Add. 20902 of the [[British Library]]), covering the period from 1497 to 1653. It was compiled on the order of D. [[Ant\u00f3nio de Ata\u00edde]], who was himself responsible for a good part of its extensive marginal annotations. Other annotations were added by later unidentified writers.\n\nOne of the more exhaustive chronologies, at least up to 1640, was compiled by [[Manuel de Faria e Sousa]] in his ''\u00c1sia Portugueza'' (part III, end of volume), published posthumously in 1675. Faria e Sousa includes not only the India Armadas, but all the Portuguese fleets from 1412, including those dispatched to Africa under Prince [[Henry the Navigator]].\n\nThere are several [[chronicle]]s of Portuguese India written by contemporaries and historians, which provide substantive descriptions of the various armadas. [[Jo\u00e3o de Barros]]'s ''D\u00e9cadas da \u00c1sia'' and [[Dami\u00e3o de G\u00f3is]]'s royal chronicles (''Cr\u00f3nica do Felic\u00edssimo Rei D. Manuel'', 1566\u201367 and ''Cr\u00f3nica do Principe D. Jo\u00e3o'', 1567) were official chronicles. As a result, while comprehensive, they have the drawbacks of being carefully [[censorship|censored]] and consciously [[propaganda|propagandistic]]. Both Barros and Gois constructed their accounts primarily from archives in Lisbon although Barros's vast work was far more comprehensive and more conscientiously faithful to accuracy (G\u00f3is's was an unabashed [[hagiography]], whereas Barros frequently updated his account on the discovery of any new scrap of information). Barros's work was supplemented later by several additional volumes written by [[Diogo do Couto]], who had spent most of his career in India.<ref>Russell-Wood (1992: p. 210)</ref>\n\nOf the unofficial accounts, [[Jer\u00f3nimo Os\u00f3rio]]'s ''De rebus Emmanuelis'', is essentially a [[Latin]] restatement of the earlier chronicles, hoping for a wider European audience, and provides little that we don't already know. [[Fern\u00e3o Lopes de Castanheda]]'s ''Hist\u00f3ria do descobrimento e conquista da \u00cdndia pelos portugueses'' (\"History of the Discovery and Conquest of the East Indies by the Portuguese\", 1554\u201359), although unofficial, is generally regarded as 'respectable' and reliable. Unlike Barros, G\u00f3is or Os\u00f3rio, Castanheda actually visited the East, spending ten years in India, and supplemented the archival material with independent interviews he conducted there and back in Coimbra.\n\nDistinct from all the others is [[Gaspar Correia]]'s ''Lendas da \u00cdndia'' (\"Legends of India\", written c. 1556, manuscript found and published only in 1885). This is almost entirely original material, his facts and names are often at variance with the official chronicles. Correia spent nearly his entire life in India, and drew primarily from materials available there. His style of writing is also much more entertaining, intense and replete with 'gossipy' details. Although not regarded as reliable, Correia's account supplies a lot of information that the others miss or prefer to remain silent on.\n\nBesides these comprehensive chronicles, there are many accounts of particular armadas \u2013 on-board diaries, accounts, memoirs and letters written by their passengers.\n\nThere is quite some conflict between the various sources over the exact composition of the various India Armadas, particularly in the names of the captains of the vessels. Attempts have been made to reconcile the differences between the sources (e.g. Quintella's ''Annaes da Marinha Portugueza''), although these inevitably involve some degree of conjecture, dispute and revision.\n\n==The Armadas==\n\n===1497===\n{{main|1st Portuguese India Armada (Gama, 1497)|Portuguese discovery of the sea route to India}}\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\" cellpadding=5\n|style=\"border-bottom:3px solid; background:#efefef;\"|'''1st India Armada (Vasco da Gama)''' ||style=\"border-bottom:3px solid; background:#efefef;\"|\n|-\n|-valign=\"top\"\n|Departed: April 1497 <br/> Arrived in India: May 1498 <br/> -------------------------<br/>Left India: October 1498 <br/> Arrived Portugal: July (Coelho)/Aug (Gama) 1499. <br/>-------------------------<br/>Notes: <br/>\u2013 Travails with [[Island of Mozambique|Mozambique]] and [[Mombassa]], <br/>\u2013 opened relations with [[Malindi]] <br/>\u2013 Opened sea route to India ([[Kozhikode|Calicut]]) <br/>\u2013 one ship scuttled on return journey || '''Fleet''': 4 ships (2 naus, 1 caravel, 1 supply ship), 170 men<br/> 1.

Most scholars generally identify him with [[Xerxes I]] of Persia, as did 19th-century Bible commentaries.<ref>\"[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1454354 The Religious Policy of Xerxes and the 'Book of Esther']\", Littman, Robert J., ''The Jewish Quarterly Review'', 65.3, January 1975, p.145\u2013148.</ref> Three factors, among others, contribute to this identification:\n\n# It is agreed the Hebrew 'Ahasuerus' descended from the Persian names for Xerxes I. Additionally, the form of the king's name written in Esther 10:1, ''\u2019a\u1e25a\u0161\u0113r\u014d\u0161'' (Hebrew: {{Hebrew|\u05d0\u05b2\u05d7\u05b7\u05e9\u05b5\u05c1\u05e8\u05b9\u05e9\u05c1}}) bears much more resemblance to the original old Persian ''X\u0161ay\u0101r\u0161a'' than the standard Hebrew form which does not omit the word\u2019s [[waw (letter)|vavim]].\n# Historian [[Herodotus]] records Xerxes I having penchants for women and wine, as well as mentioning the king ruled from India to Ethiopia in a magnificent palace in Shusan ([[Susa]]), all of which the Book of Esther corroborates. Herodotus also mentions that Xerxes I sought comfort in his [[harem]] following his [[Battle of Salamis|defeat at Salamis]] in the tenth month of his seventh year as king,{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} which is strikingly similar to the date of Ahasuerus choosing beautiful women from his harem in the tenth month of his seventh year as king (Esther 2:16).\n# Annals from the reign of Xerxes I mention an otherwise unattested official by the name of \"Marduka\", which some have proposed refers to Mordecai, as both are mentioned serving in the king's court.\n\nHowever, the Septuagint, the Vulgate, the [[Midrash]] of ''Esther Rabbah, I, 3'' and the [[Josippon]] identify the king as [[Artaxerxes I]], and the historian [[Josephus]] relates that this was the name by which he was known to the Greeks.<ref>[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=967&letter=A Ahasuerus] at the JewishEncyclopedia.com</ref> The [[Ethiopia|Ethiopic]] text calls him ''Ar\u0165eksis'', usually the Ethiopic equivalent of ''Artaxerxes''.\n\n{{Original research section|date=December 2019}}\n\n[[John of Ephesus]] and [[Bar-Hebraeus]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://syri.ac/bhchronicles|title=Chronicles of Bar Hebraeus {{!}} syri.ac|website=syri.ac|language=en|access-date=2020-03-11}}</ref> identified him as [[Artaxerxes II of Persia|Artaxerxes II]], a view strongly supported by the 20th century scholar [[Jacob Hoschander]].<ref name=\"Hosch\">Jacob Hoschander, ''The Book of Esther in the Light of History'', Oxford University Press, 1923</ref>{{page number|date=December 2019}}{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} [[Masudi]] recorded the Persian view of events which affirms the identification and [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]] similarly placed the events during the time of Artaxerxes II despite being confused by the Hebrew name for the king. ''Esther Rabba'' and the Vulgate present \"Ahasuerus\" as a different name for the king to \"Artaxerxes\" rather than an equivalent in different languages, and the Septuagint distinguished between the two names using a Greek transliteration of Ahasuerus for occurrences outside the Book of Esther. Indeed, an inscription from the time of Artaxerxes II records that he was also known as ''Arshu'' understood to be a shortening of the Babylonian form ''Achshiyarshu'' derived from the Persian ''Khshayarsha'' (Xerxes). The Greek historians [[Ctesias]] and [[Deinon]] noted that Artaxerxes II was also called ''Arsicas'' or ''Oarses'' respectively similarly understood to be derived from ''Khshayarsha'', the former as the shortened form together with the Persian suffix ''-ke'' applied to such shortened names;<ref name=\"Hosch\" />{{page number|date=December 2019}}{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} whereas in reality the Greek ''Artaxerxes'' is for the [[Old Persian]] ''Artax\u0161a\u00e7a'' (with /''\u00e7''/ for non-Persian /''\u03b8r''/, that is, ''Artax\u0161a\u03b8ra'', [[New Persian]] ''Ardashir'' \u0627\u0631\u062f\u0634\u06cc\u0631) < ''arta-'' 'justice' and ''x\u0161a\u00e7a-'' 'kingdom,' 'Having a kingdom of justice.' As is evident, the two names have different etymologies.\nIn his ''Historia Scholastica'' [[Petrus Comestor]] similarly identified Ahasuerus of Esther as the predecessor of a king called Artaxerxes (usually translated into English as Ahasuerus) who was also called Ochus i.e. [[Artaxerxes III]] thus also identifying the former Ahasuerus as Artaxerxes II. Comestor notes that Ochus had reconquered Egypt after the Ahasuerus of the book of Esther had lost it to pharaoh [[Amyrtaeus]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Historia_Scholastica/Esther#De_Ocho_seu_Artaxerxe.|title=Historia Scholastica/Esther - Wikisource|author=|date=|website=la.wikisource.org|accessdate=17 April 2018}}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=December 2019}}\n\n===Book of Ezra===\n[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz van Rijn - Ahasuerus, Haman and Esther - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Ahasuerus and [[Haman (Bible)|Haman]] at [[Ahasuerus and Haman at the Feast of Esther|Esther's Feast]]'', by [[Rembrandt]]]]\nAhasuerus is also given as the name of a [[King of Persia]] in the [[Book of Ezra]].<ref>{{bibleref|Ezra|4:5-7}}</ref> Modern commentators associate him with [[Xerxes I]] who reigned from 486 BC until 465 BC.

Most scholars generally identify him with [[Xerxes I]] of Persia, as did 19th-century Bible commentaries.<ref>\"[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1454354 The Religious Policy of Xerxes and the 'Book of Esther']\", Littman, Robert J., ''The Jewish Quarterly Review'', 65.3, January 1975, p.145\u2013148.</ref> Three factors, among others, contribute to this identification:\n\n# It is agreed the Hebrew 'Ahasuerus' descended from the Persian names for Xerxes I. Additionally, the form of the king's name written in Esther 10:1, ''\u2019a\u1e25a\u0161\u0113r\u014d\u0161'' (Hebrew: {{Hebrew|\u05d0\u05b2\u05d7\u05b7\u05e9\u05b5\u05c1\u05e8\u05b9\u05e9\u05c1}}) bears much more resemblance to the original old Persian ''X\u0161ay\u0101r\u0161a'' than the standard Hebrew form which does not omit the word\u2019s [[waw (letter)|vavim]].\n# Historian [[Herodotus]] records Xerxes I having penchants for women and wine, as well as mentioning the king ruled from India to Ethiopia in a magnificent palace in Shusan ([[Susa]]), all of which the Book of Esther corroborates. Herodotus also mentions that Xerxes I sought comfort in his [[harem]] following his [[Battle of Salamis|defeat at Salamis]] in the tenth month of his seventh year as king,{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} which is strikingly similar to the date of Ahasuerus choosing beautiful women from his harem in the tenth month of his seventh year as king (Esther 2:16).\n# Annals from the reign of Xerxes I mention an otherwise unattested official by the name of \"Marduka\", which some have proposed refers to Mordecai, as both are mentioned serving in the king's court.\n\nHowever, the Septuagint, the Vulgate, the [[Midrash]] of ''Esther Rabbah, I, 3'' and the [[Josippon]] identify the king as [[Artaxerxes I]], and the historian [[Josephus]] relates that this was the name by which he was known to the Greeks.<ref>[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=967&letter=A Ahasuerus] at the JewishEncyclopedia.com</ref> The [[Ethiopia|Ethiopic]] text calls him ''Ar\u0165eksis'', usually the Ethiopic equivalent of ''Artaxerxes''.\n\n{{Original research section|date=December 2019}}\n\n[[John of Ephesus]] and [[Bar-Hebraeus]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://syri.ac/bhchronicles|title=Chronicles of Bar Hebraeus {{!}} syri.ac|website=syri.ac|language=en|access-date=2020-03-11}}</ref> identified him as [[Artaxerxes II of Persia|Artaxerxes II]], a view strongly supported by the 20th century scholar [[Jacob Hoschander]].<ref name=\"Hosch\">Jacob Hoschander, ''The Book of Esther in the Light of History'', Oxford University Press, 1923</ref>{{page number|date=December 2019}}{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} [[Masudi]] recorded the Persian view of events which affirms the identification and [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]] similarly placed the events during the time of Artaxerxes II despite being confused by the Hebrew name for the king. ''Esther Rabba'' and the Vulgate present \"Ahasuerus\" as a different name for the king to \"Artaxerxes\" rather than an equivalent in different languages, and the Septuagint distinguished between the two names using a Greek transliteration of Ahasuerus for occurrences outside the Book of Esther. Indeed, an inscription from the time of Artaxerxes II records that he was also known as ''Arshu'' understood to be a shortening of the Babylonian form ''Achshiyarshu'' derived from the Persian ''Khshayarsha'' (Xerxes). The Greek historians [[Ctesias]] and [[Deinon]] noted that Artaxerxes II was also called ''Arsicas'' or ''Oarses'' respectively similarly understood to be derived from ''Khshayarsha'', the former as the shortened form together with the Persian suffix ''-ke'' applied to such shortened names;<ref name=\"Hosch\" />{{page number|date=December 2019}}{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} whereas in reality the Greek ''Artaxerxes'' is for the [[Old Persian]] ''Artax\u0161a\u00e7a'' (with /''\u00e7''/ for non-Persian /''\u03b8r''/, that is, ''Artax\u0161a\u03b8ra'', [[New Persian]] ''Ardashir'' \u0627\u0631\u062f\u0634\u06cc\u0631) < ''arta-'' 'justice' and ''x\u0161a\u00e7a-'' 'kingdom,' 'Having a kingdom of justice.' As is evident, the two names have different etymologies.\nIn his ''Historia Scholastica'' [[Petrus Comestor]] similarly identified Ahasuerus of Esther as the predecessor of a king called Artaxerxes (usually translated into English as Ahasuerus) who was also called Ochus i.e. [[Artaxerxes III]] thus also identifying the former Ahasuerus as Artaxerxes II. Comestor notes that Ochus had reconquered Egypt after the Ahasuerus of the book of Esther had lost it to pharaoh [[Amyrtaeus]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Historia_Scholastica/Esther#De_Ocho_seu_Artaxerxe.|title=Historia Scholastica/Esther - Wikisource|author=|date=|website=la.wikisource.org|accessdate=17 April 2018}}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=December 2019}}\n\n===Book of Ezra===\n[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz van Rijn - Ahasuerus, Haman and Esther - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Ahasuerus and [[Haman (Bible)|Haman]] at [[Ahasuerus and Haman at the Feast of Esther|Esther's Feast]]'', by [[Rembrandt]]]]\nAhasuerus is also given as the name of a [[King of Persia]] in the [[Book of Ezra]].<ref>{{bibleref|Ezra|4:5-7}}</ref> Modern commentators associate him with [[Xerxes I]] who reigned from 486 BC until 465 BC.

This is the summary position position of the Seventh-day Adventist Church's Bible Commentaries.<ref> Nichol, F.D., Seventh-day Adventist Bible Commentary, Volume 4, Review and Herald Publishing Association, (Washington, D.C., 1954 edition), p.817, \"Additional Note on Chapter 6\", last line</ref>\n\n==== Arguments for Xerxes I ====\nNot unlike the arguments for [[Cyaxares|Cyaxares I]], ''The Pulpit Commentary'' recognizing the linguistic connection above with that of Xerxes builds a case for Darius (the Persian), son of [[Xerxes I|Xerxes the Great]] as \"Ahasuerus\" in the [[Book of Daniel]].<ref>Pulpit Commentary, https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/daniel/9.htm</ref>\n\n==== Arguments for Other Characters ====\nWhile debate exists for characters such as [[Cambyses II]] and the generals and or governors Gobryas, Ugbaru & Gubaru as being Darius the Mede,<ref> Nichol, F.D., Seventh-day Adventist Bible Commentary, Volume 4, Review and Herald Publishing Association, (Washington, D.C., 1954 edition), p.815, \"Additional Note on Chapter 6\", point 3</ref> these positions are irrelevant to the subject of this page being: \"Ahasuerus\" in the \"Book of Daniel\".  For Cambyses II's father [[Cyrus]] seemingly never donned the title of \"Ahasuerus\" and the the others never donned a title higher than 'General' or 'Governor'.\n\n===Book of Tobit===\nIn some versions of the [[deuterocanon]]ical Book of Tobit, Ahasuerus is given as the name of an associate of [[Nebuchadrezzar II|Nebuchadnezzar]], who together with him, destroyed [[Nineveh]] just before Tobit's death.<ref>Book of Tobit, 14:15.</ref>  A traditional [[Catholic]] view is that he is identical to the Ahasuerus of Daniel 9:1<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02005c.htm Maas, Anthony (1907).

Parts of Valluvanad is [[Mannarkkad]] Taluk, [[Pattambi]] Taluk, [[Ottappalam]] Taluk ([[Palakkad District]]) And [[Perintalmanna]] ([[Malappuram District]])\n\nChiefs and members of the \"Vallabha\" family appear in inscriptions as early as 10th century AD. The Vellattiri Raja initially exercised suzerain rights over a large portion of central Kerala. The raja even held the presidency of [[Mamankam festival|Mamankam]], an ancient festival held once in twelve years at [[Tirunavaya]] (which was later usurped by king of Calicut). Their ancient territory was gradually broken up by the kings of Calicut (the [[Zamorin of Calicut|zamorins]]).\n\nWhen the [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore Sultans]] invaded Kerala in late 18th century, the raja found assylum in Travancore. Tipu Sultan ceded Malabar to the [[East India Company|English Company]] in 1792. The Company took over the management of the country in May 1793.<ref name=\"princelystatesofindia1\" />\n\n== Different variations of the name ==\n\n* Valluvanad - Valluvanadu - Valluvanatu - Valluvanat - Walluvanad - Walluvanatu<ref name=\"princelystatesofindia1\" /> \n* Swaroopam (Svarupam) - Arangottu'''<ref name=\"princelystatesofindia1\" />''' (Aarangottu)\n* Vellattiri - Vellatiri - Velatra - Velnatera (title of the ruler)'''<ref name=\"princelystatesofindia1\" />''' - Valluvakkonathiri\n\n=== Official names ===\n\n* Official name of the kingdom - the Kingdom of Vellattiri (source: Logan (No. XIII))\n* Official title of the Raja - Vallabha Raja (in the treaty with English) (source: Logan (No. XIII))\n\n=== Hereditary title ===\n\n* Rajasekhara (or Rayaran/Irayira Chekaran<ref name=\":0\" /> or Irayiravar<ref name=\":0\" />)\n** Rajasekhara and his son Vellan Kumaran (inscription)\n**Irayaran Chattan, the utaiyavar of Valluvanatu, in Jewish Copper Plates (1000 AD)\n\n== Headquarters ==\nThe headquarters of Valluvanad was the present day town of [[Angadipuram]], which is now famous for its [[Thirumandhamkunnu Temple]].

Serbian names are rendered in the \"Western name order\" with the [[surname]] placed after the [[given name]]. \"Eastern name order\" may be used when multiple names appear in a sorted list, particularly in official notes and legal documents when the last name is capitalized (e.g. MILOVANOVI\u0106 Janko).\n\n==Given names==\n{{See also|List of Serbian given names}}\nAs in most European cultures, a child is [[given name|given a first name]] chosen by their parents or [[godparent]]s.

Christian names include: e.g. [[Nikola]], [[Ivan (name)|Ivan]], [[Jovan]], [[Maria (given name)|Marija]], [[Anna (given name)|Ana]], Mihailo. Along similar lines of non-Slavic names among Christians, the origins for many such names are [[Greeks|Greek]]: e.g. [[Aleksandar]], [[Andrej]], [[Teodora]], [[Jelena (disambiguation)|Jelena]], [[Sophia_(name)|Sofija]], [[Katarina (given name)|Katarina]], [[Nikola]], [[\u0110or\u0111e]], [[Stefan (given name)|Stefan]], [[Petar]], [[Vasilije]], [[Todor]].

This can sometimes further be transcribed as ''-ic'', but in history, Serbian names have often been transcribed with a phonetic ending, ''-ich'' or ''-itch''.\n\nThis form is often associated with [[Serbs]] from before the early 20th century: hence [[Milutin Milankovi\u0107]] is usually referred to, for historical reasons, as Milutin Milankovitch, and [[Mileva Mari\u0107]], born in [[Vojvodina]] (then a part of Hungary) has sometimes been rendered as Marity (e.g. in the claim of \"Einstein-Marity\" theory).\n\nThe {{lang|sr-Latn|-i\u0107}} suffix is a [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] [[diminutive]], originally functioning to create [[patronymic]]s. Thus the surname [[Petrovi\u0107]] means the little son of Petar (Petri\u0107 signifies the little son of Petra, the widow).\n\nMost Serbian surnames are paternal (father), maternal (mother), occupational, or derived from personal traits.\n\nOther common surname suffixes are {{lang|sr-Latn|-ov}} ({{lang|sr-Cyrl|-\u043e\u0432}}), {{lang|sr-Latn|-ev}} ({{lang|sr-Cyrl|-\u0435\u0432}}), {{lang|sr-Latn|-in}} ({{lang|sr-Cyrl|-\u0438\u043d}}) and {{lang|sr-Latn|-ski}} ({{lang|sr-Cyrl|-\u0441\u043a\u0438}}; also {{lang|sr-Latn|-cki}}({{lang|sr-Cyrl|-\u0446\u043a\u0438}})/{{lang|sr-Latn|\u010dki}}({{lang|sr-Cyrl|\u0447\u043a\u0438}})/{{lang|sr-Latn|\u0161ki}}({{lang|sr-Cyrl|\u0448\u043a\u0438}})) which is the Slavic [[genitive case|possessive case]] suffix, thus Nikola's son becomes Nikolin, Petar's son Petrov, and Jovan's son Jovanov. The two suffixes are often combined, most commonly as {{lang|sr-Latn|-ovi\u0107}} ({{lang|sr-Cyrl|-\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b}}).

The ten most common surnames in [[Serbia]], in order, are [[Jovanovi\u0107]], [[Petrovi\u0107]], [[Nikoli\u0107]], [[Markovi\u0107]], [[\u0110or\u0111evi\u0107]], [[Stojanovi\u0107]], [[Ili\u0107]], [[Stankovi\u0107]], [[Pavlovi\u0107]] and [[Milo\u0161evi\u0107]].<ref name=Politika>http://www.politika.rs/rubrike/Drustvo/U-Srbiji-najvise-Jovanovica-Petrovica-i-Nikolica.lt.html</ref>\n\nOutside Serbian countries, Slavic suffixes have been transliterated. [[Serbs in Hungary]] have the endings {{lang|hu|-ity}}, {{lang|hu|-ics}} {{lang|hu|-its}}, [[Serbs in North Macedonia]] {{transl|mk|-ikj}} (or {{transl|mk|i\u1e31}}; [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]: {{lang|mk|\u0438\u045c}}), and [[Serbs in Romania]] {{lang|ro|-ici}}.\n\nAlthough far less common than patronymic surnames, matronymic surnames are widespread both in Serbia and in neighboring countries where Serbs live. Examples include surnames such as Kati\u0107, Sin\u0111eli\u0107, Nedi\u0107, Mari\u0107, Vi\u0161nji\u0107, Janji\u0107, Sari\u0107, Mili\u010di\u0107, Mileni\u0107, Natali\u0107, Zori\u0107, Smilji\u0107, An\u0111eli\u0107 and many others. Sometimes it is difficult to ascertain if the name of a specific family is patronymic or matronymic considering many Serbian names have both male and female version (for example, surname Miljani\u0107 could come from both m.- Miljan and f.- Miljana). Cases where widows had to become heads of households were not uncommon during 18th and 19th century and when surnames were first standardized in Serbia in 1851 it was decided they would be based on the names of eldest living heads of households which in some cases were women. People who did not know their father well would also often take matronymic surnames, with a notable case being the hero of the First Serbian Uprising Stevan Sin\u0111eli\u0107, who took that surname in honor of his mother Sin\u0111elija.\n\n==History==\nThe names of early Serbian rulers like [[Mutimir]] are [[Slavic dithematic names]], as per Old Slavic tradition, until the 9th century and Christianization after which Christian names appear.<ref>{{cite book|author=SANU|title=Glas|volume=377-381|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CLcrAQAAIAAJ|year=1995|publisher=Srpska akademija nauka i umetnosti|page=37|quote=<!-- [p. 37:] \u0423 \u043b\u043e\u0437\u0430\u043c\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0430- \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0440\u043f\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u043a\u043d\u0435\u0436\u0435\u0432\u0430, \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0430\u0440\u0445\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u043a\u043e \u0438\u0445 \u0437\u043e\u0432\u0443 \u0433\u0440\u0447\u043a\u0438 \u0438\u0437\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0438, \u0442\u043e ]\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0434\u044d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0443\u0448\u044c\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0434\u0438 \u0443\u0437\u043e\u0440\u0430\u043a: \u0412\u0438\u0448\u0435\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432, \u0420\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432, \u041f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0433\u043e], \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440, \u0425\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440, \u041c\u0443\u0442\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 (\u0442\u0430\u0434\u0430, \u0443 IX \u0432\u0435\u043a\u0443, \u0438\u043c\u0435 \u0441\u0435 ]0\u0448 \u0438\u0437\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043b\u043e \u0441\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0437\u0430- \u043b\u043e\u043c: ...-->}}</ref>\n\n[[Demetrios Chomatenos]] ([[Archbishop of Ohrid]] from 1216 to 1236) registered the naming culture of the [[South Slavs]] in [[Byzantine lands]]. In the 11th and 12th century, family names became more common and stable in Byzantium, adapted by the majority of people in [[Macedonia_(region)#Medieval_Macedonia|Byzantine Macedonia]], [[Epirus]] and other regions (including women, sometimes even monks), not only aristocrats. The South Slavs, however, maintained the tradition of only giving a personal name, sometimes with a [[Patronymic]]. There are only 2 cases of family names used by South Slavs during this time; Bogdanopoulos and Serbopoulos, both Serbian names with the Greek suffix -opoulos (\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2, originating in [[Peloponnese]] in the 10th century).<ref>http://en.scientificcommons.org/41510473</ref> Patronymics ending on -i\u0107, on the other hand, seem to have been the norm by late 14th and early 15th century because nearly all letters of correspondence between Dubrovnik and Serbia and Bosnia from that period contain them. In that same period proper family names of Slavic origin, not just patronymics, appear in Dubrovnik and soon in Hum and then in Serbia and Bosnia where during 15th-century nobles start using proper surnames. However this never became common among ordinary people and since nobility of Serbia and Bosnia was mostly wiped out by 16th century, only their remnants in Venice, Hungary and later Habsburg monarchy as well as some members of high clergy used standard surnames during following centuries. Due to general lack of safety clans started to form in regions of Montenegro and Herzegovina from 15th century onwards. These clans were territorially based but each was subdivided into fraternities so some people used names of these fraternities as a surname in those regions but only when speaking to outsiders and more as a toponymic rather than proper surname.\n\nIn older naming convention which was common in Serbia up until the mid 19th century a person's name would consist of three distinct parts: the person's given name, the patronymic derived from father's personal name, and the family or fraternity name, as seen in for example in the name of language reformer Vuk Stefanovi\u0107 Karad\u017ei\u0107. However, use of this convention depended on a person's education and interest in his ancestry. Most ordinary people were still referred to mostly by their given name and sometimes with a patronymic, profession or toponymic. Serbian surnames as used today were first standardized in Principality of Serbia during 1851 and on the census of 1854, the population was recorded by their fixed surnames for the first time. Surnames were mostly formed as patronymics (or in some cases matronymics) derived from names of at the time eldest living heads of households rather than distant ancestors, though there were exceptions. In most cases, such patronymics were already in use so they were simply \"frozen\" and turned into surnames that carried on into future generations. This swift introduction of surnames is one of the reasons why, in comparison to other regions where Serbs live, there is less variation in forms of surnames within central Serbia, where vast majority of surnames ends with suffixes -ovi\u0107 (in patronymic surnames) and -i\u0107 (can be used both for patronymic and for matronymic surnames).\n\nAmong Serbs that lived across the rivers Drina, Sava and Danube, in addition to surnames with these most common suffixes there were many surnames based on professions, nicknames, toponymics, traits, etc. In case of what was then Southern Hungary, Serb suffixes were often intentionally changed by Austro-Hungarian administrators from -ovi\u0107, -evi\u0107 and -i\u0107 into -ov, -ev, -in and -ski which in their mind sounded less typically Serbian. This process started around 1817 but was particularly intensified after 1860/61 when Duchy of Serbia and Tami\u0161 Banate was abolished and 1867 when Habsburg monarchy was reformed into Austro-Hungary. By 1900s it had only moderate success and it never achieved its true goal of culturally separating Vojvodina Serbs from their brethren to the south. In some regions with Serbian majority which were only liberated during wars of 1912\u20131918, standardized surnames were finally introduced with the creation of Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and recorded for the first time during population census of 1921.\n\n==See also==\n{{Serbs}}\n* [[Slavic names]]\n* [[Slavic surnames]]\n\n{{Names_in_world_cultures}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n;Books\n*{{cite book|last=Grkovi\u0107|first=Milica|title=Re\u010dnik li\u010dnih imena kod Srba|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1D9CAQAAIAAJ|year=1977|publisher=Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107|location=Belgrade|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Jovi\u010devi\u0107|first=Radojica|title=Li\u010dna imena u staroslovenskom jeziku|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fc0cAAAAMAAJ|year=1985|publisher=Filolo\u0161ki fakultet Beogradskog Univerziteta}}\n*{{cite book|last=Stojanovi\u0107|first=Katarina|title=Srpska imena: narodna i hri\u0161\u0107anska|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oIDhGAAACAAJ|year=2007|publisher=Gramatik|isbn=978-86-84421-51-9}}\n*{{cite book|last=Janjatovi\u0107|first=\u0110or\u0111e|year=1993|title=\u041f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0430 \u0443 \u0411\u043e\u0441\u043d\u0438|location=Sombor|publisher=Prosveta-Trgovina}}\n*{{cite book|last=Mili\u0107evi\u0107|first=Risto|year=2005|title=Hercegova\u010dka prezimena|location=Belgrade|publisher=}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Vukovi\u0107|first1=Gordana|last2=Nedeljkov|first2=Ljiljana|title=\u0420\u0435\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0448\u0430\u0458\u043a\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0435 (XVIII \u0438 XIX vek)|publisher=\u0424\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0437\u043e\u0444\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0444\u0430\u043a\u0443\u043b\u0442\u0435\u0442|location=Novi Sad|year=1983}}\n*{{cite book|last=Mihajlovi\u0107|first=Velimir|title=\u0421\u0440\u043f\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043a|publisher=\u0410\u0443\u0440\u043e\u0440\u0430|location=Novi Sad|year=2002}}\n*{{cite book|last=\u0160imunovi\u0107|first=Petar|title=Na\u0161a prezimena|publisher=Matica hrvatska|location=Zagreb|year=1985}}\n\n;Journals\n*{{cite journal|last=Vukanovi\u0107|first=Tatomir|year=1940|title=Li\u010dna imena kod Srba|editor=Drobnjakovi\u0107, Borivoje|journal=\u0413\u043b\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0438\u043a \u0415\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433 \u043c\u0443\u0437\u0435\u0458\u0430 \u0443 \u0411\u0435\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0443|volume=15|publisher=\u0415\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043c\u0443\u0437\u0435\u0458 \u0443 \u0411\u0435\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0443|url=http://etnografskimuzej.rs/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Glasnik-Etnografskog-muzeja-u-Beogradu-knjiga-15-godina-19401.pdf|pages=56\u201375}}\n*{{cite journal|last=Zuji\u0107|first=Krunoslav|year=1995|title=Prezimena i porodi\u010dni nadimci u Imotskoj krajini|journal=Imotski zbornik|volume=3|publisher=|location=|url=|pp=45-133}}\n\n;Other\n*{{cite document|author=Republic of Serbia|year=2012|origyear=2011|title=\u041d\u0430\u0458\u0447\u0435\u0448\u045b\u0430 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0443 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0458\u0438|publisher=Republic of Serbia|url=http://pod2.stat.gov.rs/ObjavljenePublikacije/Popis2011/Najcesca%20imena%20i%20pezimena.pdf}}\n*{{cite web|title=\u0421\u0440\u043f\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0443 \u0414\u0430\u043b\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0458\u0438|publisher=Poreklo|date=5 April 2012|url=http://www.poreklo.rs/2012/04/05/srpska-prezimena-u-dalmaciji/}}\n*{{cite web|title=\u041f\u043e\u0440\u0435\u043a\u043b\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0430 \u0443 \u041f\u043e\u0442\u043a\u043e\u0437\u0430\u0440\u0458\u0443|publisher=Poreklo|date=3 July 2012|url=http://www.poreklo.rs/2012/07/03/poreklo-prezimena-srba-u-potkozarju/}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Serbian naming customs}}\n[[Category:Names by culture]]\n[[Category:Serbian culture]]\n[[Category:Slavic-language names]]\n[[Category:Serbian-language names| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=August 2009}}\n{{See also|Names of the Serbs}}\n\nThis article features the '''naming culture''' of '''[[personal name]]s''' of ethnic [[Serbs]] and the [[Serbian language]].

Names of [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] origin, entering through Russian, include: e.g. [[Igor (given name)|Igor]], [[Oliver (given name)|Oliver]], [[Olga (name)|Olga]].\n\nIn Serbian naming culture, apotropaic names (''za\u0161titna imena'', \"protective names\") include [[Vuk (name)|Vuk]] (and its many derivatives), [[Nenad]], [[Prodan]], [[Sredoje]], [[Stani\u0161a]], and others.<ref>{{cite book|last=Grkovi\u0107|first=Milica|title=Re\u010dnik li\u010dnih imena kod Srba|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1D9CAQAAIAAJ|year=1977|publisher=Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107|location=Belgrade}}</ref>\n\n{{hidden begin\n|title = Examples (table)\n|toggle = left\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#ececec\" align=\"center\"\n!| [[Serbian language|Serbian]] || Derivation || Origin || Meaning || <small>Related<br>(Forms)</small> || Female\n|-\n| [[Miroslav (given name)|Miroslav]]<br>\u041c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\n| \n| [[Slavic languages|Slavic]]\n| Peace and Glory\n| [[Miros\u0142aw (given name)|Miros\u0142aw]], Mirko\n| Mira, Miroslava\n|-\n| [[Vladimir (name)|Vladimir]]<br>\u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440\n| \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0463\u0440\u044a\n| [[Slavic languages|Slavic]]<br><small>[[Old Church Slavonic]]</small>\n| Rule in Peace\n| ''Vlada'', ''Vlado''\n| Vladimira, Vlada\n|-\n| [[Vuka\u0161in]]<br>\u0412\u0443\u043a\u0430\u0448\u0438\u043d\n|\n| [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]]\n| Son of the wolf, younger wolf\n| Vuki, Vuk, Vule, Vu\u010dko, Vukosav\n| Vuka, Vukica\n|-\n| [[Zoran]]<br>\u0417\u043e\u0440\u0430\u043d\n| \n| [[Slavic languages|Slavic]]\n| Daybreak\n| ''Zoki'', ''Zo\u0107a''\n| Zora, Zorana, Zorica\n|-\n| [[Goran (Slavic name)|Goran]]<br>\u0413\u043e\u0440\u0430\u043d\n| \n| [[Slavic languages|Slavic]]\n| Woodsman, Highlander<br>\"The tall one\"\n| \n| Gora, Gorana, Gorica, Goga, Gorjanka\n|-\n| [[Aleksandar]]<br>\u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440\n| Al\u00e9xandros<br>\u0391\u03bb\u03ad\u03be\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2\n| [[Greek language|Greek]]\n| Protector of Man\n| Aleksa, ''Sa\u0161a'', ''Sale''\n| Aleksandra, Sa\u0161a, Sa\u0161ka\n|-\n| [[John (given name)|Jovan]]<br>\u0408\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\n| Ioannis<br>\u0399\u03c9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2\n| [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]<br><small>(Biblical)</small>\n| God is gracious\n| [[Ivan (name)|Ivan]]<br>Jovo, Jovica, Joca, Jole\n| Jovana, Ivana, Ivanka, Iva\n|-\n| [[Marko (given name)|Marko]]<br>\u041c\u0430\u0440\u043a\u043e\n| [[Marcus (name)|Marcus]]\n| [[Latin]]\n|\n| Maki, Mare\n|\n|-\n| [[Nikola]]<br>\u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\n| [[Nikolaos]]<br>\u039d\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03bb\u03b1\u03bf\u03c2\n| [[Greek language|Greek]]\n| Victory of the people\n| ''Nid\u017ea'', Niko\n| Nikoleta, Nikolina\n|-\n| [[\u0110or\u0111e]]<br>\u0402op\u0452e\n| [[Georgios]]<br>\u0393\u03b5\u03ce\u03c1\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2\n| [[Greek language|Greek]]\n| Farmer\n| [[\u0110ura\u0111 (disambiguation)|\u0110ura\u0111]]<br>''\u0110uro'', ''\u0110ole'', ''\u0110oka'', \u0110or\u0111a, \u0110or\u0111o\n| \u0110or\u0111ica, \u0110ur\u0111ica, \u0110ur\u0111ina\n|-\n| [[Mihajlo]]<br>\u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0458\u043b\u043e\n| [[Mikha'el]]<br>\u05de\u05b4\u05d9\u05db\u05b8\u05d0\u05b5\u05dc\n| [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]<br><small>(Biblical)</small>\n| \"He who is like God\"\n| Mika, Miki, ''Miha'', Mi\u0161a\n|\n|-\n|}\n{{hidden end}}\n\n==Surnames==\n\nMost '''Serbian surnames''' have the surname [[suffix]] {{lang|sr-Latn|[[-i\u0107]]}} ([[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Serbian Cyrillic]]: {{lang|sr-Cyrl|-\u0438\u045b}}) ({{IPA-sh|it\u0255|}}). This can sometimes further be transcribed as ''-ic'', but in history, Serbian names have often been transcribed with a phonetic ending, ''-ich'' or ''-itch''.\n\nThis form is often associated with [[Serbs]] from before the early 20th century: hence [[Milutin Milankovi\u0107]] is usually referred to, for historical reasons, as Milutin Milankovitch, and [[Mileva Mari\u0107]], born in [[Vojvodina]] (then a part of Hungary) has sometimes been rendered as Marity (e.g. in the claim of \"Einstein-Marity\" theory).\n\nThe {{lang|sr-Latn|-i\u0107}} suffix is a [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] [[diminutive]], originally functioning to create [[patronymic]]s. Thus the surname [[Petrovi\u0107]] means the little son of Petar (Petri\u0107 signifies the little son of Petra, the widow).\n\nMost Serbian surnames are paternal (father), maternal (mother), occupational, or derived from personal traits.\n\nOther common surname suffixes are {{lang|sr-Latn|-ov}} ({{lang|sr-Cyrl|-\u043e\u0432}}), {{lang|sr-Latn|-ev}} ({{lang|sr-Cyrl|-\u0435\u0432}}), {{lang|sr-Latn|-in}} ({{lang|sr-Cyrl|-\u0438\u043d}}) and {{lang|sr-Latn|-ski}} ({{lang|sr-Cyrl|-\u0441\u043a\u0438}}; also {{lang|sr-Latn|-cki}}({{lang|sr-Cyrl|-\u0446\u043a\u0438}})/{{lang|sr-Latn|\u010dki}}({{lang|sr-Cyrl|\u0447\u043a\u0438}})/{{lang|sr-Latn|\u0161ki}}({{lang|sr-Cyrl|\u0448\u043a\u0438}})) which is the Slavic [[genitive case|possessive case]] suffix, thus Nikola's son becomes Nikolin, Petar's son Petrov, and Jovan's son Jovanov. The two suffixes are often combined, most commonly as {{lang|sr-Latn|-ovi\u0107}} ({{lang|sr-Cyrl|-\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b}}). Other, less common suffices are {{lang|sr-Latn|-alj}}({{lang|sr-Cyrl|-\u0430\u0459}})/{{lang|sr-Latn|olj}}({{lang|sr-Cyrl|\u043e\u0459}})/{{lang|sr-Latn|elj}}({{lang|sr-Cyrl|\u0435\u0459}}), {{lang|sr-Latn|-ija}} ({{lang|sr-Cyrl|-\u0438\u0458\u0430}}), {{lang|sr-Latn|-ica}} ({{lang|sr-Cyrl|-\u0438\u0446\u0430}}), {{lang|sr-Latn|-ar}}({{lang|sr-Cyrl|-\u0430\u0440}})/{{lang|sr-Latn|ac}}({{lang|sr-Cyrl|\u0430\u0446}})/{{lang|sr-Latn|an}}({{lang|sr-Cyrl|\u0430\u043d}}).\n\nWhen marrying, the woman most often adopts her husband's family name, though she can also keep both of her last names or not change her last name at all.\n\nIt is estimated that some two thirds of all Serbian surnames end in {{lang|sr-Latn|-i\u0107}}. The ten most common surnames in [[Serbia]], in order, are [[Jovanovi\u0107]], [[Petrovi\u0107]], [[Nikoli\u0107]], [[Markovi\u0107]], [[\u0110or\u0111evi\u0107]], [[Stojanovi\u0107]], [[Ili\u0107]], [[Stankovi\u0107]], [[Pavlovi\u0107]] and [[Milo\u0161evi\u0107]].<ref name=Politika>http://www.politika.rs/rubrike/Drustvo/U-Srbiji-najvise-Jovanovica-Petrovica-i-Nikolica.lt.html</ref>\n\nOutside Serbian countries, Slavic suffixes have been transliterated. [[Serbs in Hungary]] have the endings {{lang|hu|-ity}}, {{lang|hu|-ics}} {{lang|hu|-its}}, [[Serbs in North Macedonia]] {{transl|mk|-ikj}} (or {{transl|mk|i\u1e31}}; [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]: {{lang|mk|\u0438\u045c}}), and [[Serbs in Romania]] {{lang|ro|-ici}}.\n\nAlthough far less common than patronymic surnames, matronymic surnames are widespread both in Serbia and in neighboring countries where Serbs live. Examples include surnames such as Kati\u0107, Sin\u0111eli\u0107, Nedi\u0107, Mari\u0107, Vi\u0161nji\u0107, Janji\u0107, Sari\u0107, Mili\u010di\u0107, Mileni\u0107, Natali\u0107, Zori\u0107, Smilji\u0107, An\u0111eli\u0107 and many others. Sometimes it is difficult to ascertain if the name of a specific family is patronymic or matronymic considering many Serbian names have both male and female version (for example, surname Miljani\u0107 could come from both m.- Miljan and f.- Miljana). Cases where widows had to become heads of households were not uncommon during 18th and 19th century and when surnames were first standardized in Serbia in 1851 it was decided they would be based on the names of eldest living heads of households which in some cases were women. People who did not know their father well would also often take matronymic surnames, with a notable case being the hero of the First Serbian Uprising Stevan Sin\u0111eli\u0107, who took that surname in honor of his mother Sin\u0111elija.\n\n==History==\nThe names of early Serbian rulers like [[Mutimir]] are [[Slavic dithematic names]], as per Old Slavic tradition, until the 9th century and Christianization after which Christian names appear.<ref>{{cite book|author=SANU|title=Glas|volume=377-381|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CLcrAQAAIAAJ|year=1995|publisher=Srpska akademija nauka i umetnosti|page=37|quote=<!-- [p. 37:] \u0423 \u043b\u043e\u0437\u0430\u043c\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0430- \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0440\u043f\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u043a\u043d\u0435\u0436\u0435\u0432\u0430, \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0430\u0440\u0445\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u043a\u043e \u0438\u0445 \u0437\u043e\u0432\u0443 \u0433\u0440\u0447\u043a\u0438 \u0438\u0437\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0438, \u0442\u043e ]\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0434\u044d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0443\u0448\u044c\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0434\u0438 \u0443\u0437\u043e\u0440\u0430\u043a: \u0412\u0438\u0448\u0435\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432, \u0420\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432, \u041f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0433\u043e], \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440, \u0425\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440, \u041c\u0443\u0442\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 (\u0442\u0430\u0434\u0430, \u0443 IX \u0432\u0435\u043a\u0443, \u0438\u043c\u0435 \u0441\u0435 ]0\u0448 \u0438\u0437\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043b\u043e \u0441\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0437\u0430- \u043b\u043e\u043c: ...-->}}</ref>\n\n[[Demetrios Chomatenos]] ([[Archbishop of Ohrid]] from 1216 to 1236) registered the naming culture of the [[South Slavs]] in [[Byzantine lands]]. In the 11th and 12th century, family names became more common and stable in Byzantium, adapted by the majority of people in [[Macedonia_(region)#Medieval_Macedonia|Byzantine Macedonia]], [[Epirus]] and other regions (including women, sometimes even monks), not only aristocrats. The South Slavs, however, maintained the tradition of only giving a personal name, sometimes with a [[Patronymic]]. There are only 2 cases of family names used by South Slavs during this time; Bogdanopoulos and Serbopoulos, both Serbian names with the Greek suffix -opoulos (\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2, originating in [[Peloponnese]] in the 10th century).<ref>http://en.scientificcommons.org/41510473</ref> Patronymics ending on -i\u0107, on the other hand, seem to have been the norm by late 14th and early 15th century because nearly all letters of correspondence between Dubrovnik and Serbia and Bosnia from that period contain them. In that same period proper family names of Slavic origin, not just patronymics, appear in Dubrovnik and soon in Hum and then in Serbia and Bosnia where during 15th-century nobles start using proper surnames. However this never became common among ordinary people and since nobility of Serbia and Bosnia was mostly wiped out by 16th century, only their remnants in Venice, Hungary and later Habsburg monarchy as well as some members of high clergy used standard surnames during following centuries. Due to general lack of safety clans started to form in regions of Montenegro and Herzegovina from 15th century onwards. These clans were territorially based but each was subdivided into fraternities so some people used names of these fraternities as a surname in those regions but only when speaking to outsiders and more as a toponymic rather than proper surname.\n\nIn older naming convention which was common in Serbia up until the mid 19th century a person's name would consist of three distinct parts: the person's given name, the patronymic derived from father's personal name, and the family or fraternity name, as seen in for example in the name of language reformer Vuk Stefanovi\u0107 Karad\u017ei\u0107. However, use of this convention depended on a person's education and interest in his ancestry. Most ordinary people were still referred to mostly by their given name and sometimes with a patronymic, profession or toponymic. Serbian surnames as used today were first standardized in Principality of Serbia during 1851 and on the census of 1854, the population was recorded by their fixed surnames for the first time. Surnames were mostly formed as patronymics (or in some cases matronymics) derived from names of at the time eldest living heads of households rather than distant ancestors, though there were exceptions. In most cases, such patronymics were already in use so they were simply \"frozen\" and turned into surnames that carried on into future generations. This swift introduction of surnames is one of the reasons why, in comparison to other regions where Serbs live, there is less variation in forms of surnames within central Serbia, where vast majority of surnames ends with suffixes -ovi\u0107 (in patronymic surnames) and -i\u0107 (can be used both for patronymic and for matronymic surnames).\n\nAmong Serbs that lived across the rivers Drina, Sava and Danube, in addition to surnames with these most common suffixes there were many surnames based on professions, nicknames, toponymics, traits, etc. In case of what was then Southern Hungary, Serb suffixes were often intentionally changed by Austro-Hungarian administrators from -ovi\u0107, -evi\u0107 and -i\u0107 into -ov, -ev, -in and -ski which in their mind sounded less typically Serbian. This process started around 1817 but was particularly intensified after 1860/61 when Duchy of Serbia and Tami\u0161 Banate was abolished and 1867 when Habsburg monarchy was reformed into Austro-Hungary. By 1900s it had only moderate success and it never achieved its true goal of culturally separating Vojvodina Serbs from their brethren to the south. In some regions with Serbian majority which were only liberated during wars of 1912\u20131918, standardized surnames were finally introduced with the creation of Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and recorded for the first time during population census of 1921.\n\n==See also==\n{{Serbs}}\n* [[Serbian-language given names]]\n* [[Slavic names]]\n* [[Slavic surnames]]\n\n{{Names_in_world_cultures}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n;Books\n*{{cite book|last=Grkovi\u0107|first=Milica|title=Re\u010dnik li\u010dnih imena kod Srba|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1D9CAQAAIAAJ|year=1977|publisher=Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107|location=Belgrade|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Jovi\u010devi\u0107|first=Radojica|title=Li\u010dna imena u staroslovenskom jeziku|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fc0cAAAAMAAJ|year=1985|publisher=Filolo\u0161ki fakultet Beogradskog Univerziteta}}\n*{{cite book|last=Stojanovi\u0107|first=Katarina|title=Srpska imena: narodna i hri\u0161\u0107anska|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oIDhGAAACAAJ|year=2007|publisher=Gramatik|isbn=978-86-84421-51-9}}\n*{{cite book|last=Janjatovi\u0107|first=\u0110or\u0111e|year=1993|title=\u041f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0430 \u0443 \u0411\u043e\u0441\u043d\u0438|location=Sombor|publisher=Prosveta-Trgovina}}\n*{{cite book|last=Mili\u0107evi\u0107|first=Risto|year=2005|title=Hercegova\u010dka prezimena|location=Belgrade|publisher=}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Vukovi\u0107|first1=Gordana|last2=Nedeljkov|first2=Ljiljana|title=\u0420\u0435\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0448\u0430\u0458\u043a\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0435 (XVIII \u0438 XIX vek)|publisher=\u0424\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0437\u043e\u0444\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0444\u0430\u043a\u0443\u043b\u0442\u0435\u0442|location=Novi Sad|year=1983}}\n*{{cite book|last=Mihajlovi\u0107|first=Velimir|title=\u0421\u0440\u043f\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043a|publisher=\u0410\u0443\u0440\u043e\u0440\u0430|location=Novi Sad|year=2002}}\n*{{cite book|last=\u0160imunovi\u0107|first=Petar|title=Na\u0161a prezimena|publisher=Matica hrvatska|location=Zagreb|year=1985}}\n\n;Journals\n*{{cite journal|last=Vukanovi\u0107|first=Tatomir|year=1940|title=Li\u010dna imena kod Srba|editor=Drobnjakovi\u0107, Borivoje|journal=\u0413\u043b\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0438\u043a \u0415\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433 \u043c\u0443\u0437\u0435\u0458\u0430 \u0443 \u0411\u0435\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0443|volume=15|publisher=\u0415\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043c\u0443\u0437\u0435\u0458 \u0443 \u0411\u0435\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0443|url=http://etnografskimuzej.rs/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Glasnik-Etnografskog-muzeja-u-Beogradu-knjiga-15-godina-19401.pdf|pages=56\u201375}}\n*{{cite journal|last=Zuji\u0107|first=Krunoslav|year=1995|title=Prezimena i porodi\u010dni nadimci u Imotskoj krajini|journal=Imotski zbornik|volume=3|publisher=|location=|url=|pp=45-133}}\n\n;Other\n*{{cite document|author=Republic of Serbia|year=2012|origyear=2011|title=\u041d\u0430\u0458\u0447\u0435\u0448\u045b\u0430 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0443 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0458\u0438|publisher=Republic of Serbia|url=http://pod2.stat.gov.rs/ObjavljenePublikacije/Popis2011/Najcesca%20imena%20i%20pezimena.pdf}}\n*{{cite web|title=\u0421\u0440\u043f\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0443 \u0414\u0430\u043b\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0458\u0438|publisher=Poreklo|date=5 April 2012|url=http://www.poreklo.rs/2012/04/05/srpska-prezimena-u-dalmaciji/}}\n*{{cite web|title=\u041f\u043e\u0440\u0435\u043a\u043b\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0430 \u0443 \u041f\u043e\u0442\u043a\u043e\u0437\u0430\u0440\u0458\u0443|publisher=Poreklo|date=3 July 2012|url=http://www.poreklo.rs/2012/07/03/poreklo-prezimena-srba-u-potkozarju/}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Serbian naming customs}}\n[[Category:Names by culture]]\n[[Category:Serbian culture]]\n[[Category:Slavic-language names]]\n[[Category:Serbian-language names| ]]\n", "name_user": "SrpskiAnonimac", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSee also", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbian_names"}

Both clans were very proud of the purity of their royal blood and had practised this tradition of inter-marriage since ancient times. For example, [[\u015buddhodana|Suddhodana's]] paternal aunt was married to the Koliyan ruler [[A\u00f1jana]]. Their daughters, [[Mayadevi|Mahamaya]] and [[Mahaprajapati|Mahapajapati Gotami]], were married to [[\u015auddhodana]], the chief of the [[Shakya|Sakyans]]. Similarly, [[Yashodhara]], daughter of [[Suppabuddha]], who was [[A\u00f1jana]]'s son, was married to the Sakyan prince, [[Gautama Buddha]]. Thus, the two royal families were related by marriage bonds between maternal and paternal cousins since ancient times. In spite of such close blood-ties, there would be occasional rifts between the two royal families, which sometimes turned into open hostility.\n\n=== Early ===\nRecords of Koli people exist from at least the 15th century, when rulers in the present-day Gujarat region noted their chieftains as being marauding robbers and [[dacoit]]s. According to the historical anthropology [[Susan Bayly]] of [[University of Cambridge]] states that this is the [[Kshatriya]] of [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] and uppar [[India]].

In 1650, kolis revolted against sultan [[Aurangzeb]] because of [[Jizya]] taxes on [[Zamindar]]s. It was a big turning point in the history of kolis because after this Rebellion, kolis were highly reputed in the [[Maratha Navy]], [[Maratha Army]] and [[Maratha Empire]]. This Rebellion was a good and big chance for [[Maratha emperors|Maratha Emporer]] the [[Shivaji]] to shake the aurangzeb. In 1650, kolis revolted under their koli chief ''Khemi Sarnaik'' with the supportive words of shivaji maharaj. firstly Sarnaik assembled the other koli [[Nayak (title)|Naiks]] to end the mughal rule and promised them to end the rule in only first rebellion. In the starting of revolt, kolis under Sarnaik shaked the sultan Aurangzeb but latter they were hunted by lacks of mughal soldiers. Sarnaik sought the help from shivaji maharaj but kolis were not helped by maratha emporer. The ''Khemi Sarnaik'' was killed by mughal commander thereafter the family members also were killed by the order of aurangzeb and then the kolis of same clan as Sarnaik were searched and killed. The end of koli rebellion was very haunted, thousands of the kolis were captured and taken to [[Junnar]] to the mughal [[Faujdar]] where their heads were cutoff at a one place. But latter sultan Aurangzeb erected an monument at the heads of kolis named ''<nowiki/>'Koli Chabutra''' and Jiziya tax was stopped. After this, kolis were received high positions in maratha empire such as ''Kanhoji Angre'' who was admiral of maratha navy, ''Tanaji Malusare'', a commander in maratha army and ''Suryaji Malusare, Kondaji Ramji Shelar and Lai Patil'' were notable personalities from martha army and navy.<ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThree of the major uprisings of kolis were in the years of 1694, 1721 and 1729 against muslim rule, the kolis of gujarat continually challenged the mighal authority. A [[Babi dynasty|Babi]] Muhammad Mubariz Khan (ancestor of [[Junagadh State]] family) of pasthoon tribe was appointed as governor of the [[Vadnagar]] and ordered to control the koli's turbulent activities. Kolis were in rebellion against muslim rule so Mubariz khan commanded the imperial army against kolis of sampra was but he was killed by kolis of that village.\n\nsecond in 1721,the kolis of [[Pethapur State|Pethapur]] challenged the mughal authority. They plundered the merchants and villages. The governor of [[Kheda]] was ordered to subdue the kolis but in the batyle at pethapur in 1721 kolis killed governor ''Kasim Ali Khan'' in action. Third in 1729, the kolis of [[Radhanpur]] revolted against the mughals in gujarat. A [[Babi dynasty|Babi]] of radhanpur assisted the mughals in gujarat and he was appointed as the governor of Radhanpur with the title of ''Jawan Marad Khan'' and founded the [[Radhanpur State]] as independent ruler. Kolis of his territory were in revolt wind already against mughals. Kolis infested the roads, blocked the minor ways, plundered the villages and challenged the authority. The first [[Nawab]] of radhanpur Jawan Marad Khan was ordered by sultan to put down the kolis. Khan marched against kolis of ''Balor'' in his territory and happened a critical struggle between nawab and kolis. But nawab was killed in action by the kolis of balor.<ref name=\":24\" /><ref name=\":23\" />\n\nin the later part of [[18th century]], the ''Khant Kolis'' rebelled against [[Muslims|Muslim]] rule in [[Junagadh State]] whose ruler was faujdar of mughals. The kolis of [[Junagadh]] revolted under a khant koli named ''Mansa Khant'' who shaked the junagadh government and muslim ruler. The [[Nawab]] of junagadh was unable to prevent the khant kolis. Mansa khant captured the [[Uparkot Fort]] from nawab. After this occurrence, nawab sought the help from [[Rajput]] ruler of [[Gondal State]] and the British government to put down the kolis thereafter combined forces of the british, junagadh and gondal attacked the uparkot fort and burnt the koli rebellion.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":15\" />\n\nThe kolis continued to their fight, a similar rebellion also mentioned in the pages of history of maharashtra. In 1761, kolis of [[Sahyadri]] revolted against [[Nizam of Hyderabad]]. A storming party of kolis under their chiefs ''Gamaji Bhangre and Kheroji Pattikar'' captured the [[Trimbak|Trimbak Fort]] from [[Hyderabad State]] and annexed the fort in maratha Empire. It shows the contributions of kolis in the standing of maratha empire thereafter both of the koli chiefs were rewarded with the grants of a large sum of money and many villages with the titles of [[Deshmukh]] and [[Patil (title)|Patil]] by [[Peshwa]].<ref name=\":11\" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=The Executive Editor And Secretary|first=Gazetteers Department|url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.7537|title=Maharastra State Gazetteers Ahmednagar District|date=1976}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cultural.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/Ahmadnagar/people_castes.html|title=Maharashtra government|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of [[19th century]] in 1803, there was a koli rebellion against [[East India Company]] in [[Kheda district]]. The british officials declared the dharala kolis most turbulent and predatory tribe of india. They kolis of kheda didn't obey the rules of British government and plundered the villages and towns in British territory and claimed a costmary right to plunder the villages like their forfathers. The district magistrate informed the officials that plundering right in not new to kolis it is a traditional way of collecting the tax from villages from ancient time of kolis. In 1808, koli chiefs such as ''Koli Thakors and Koli Patels'' started the invading the villages and stealing the crops and other possessions mostly in the [[Dholka Taluka]] and neighboring villages of british Territory with the groups of the hundreds of the armed kolis without any difficulties. On February 1808, one of the koli named ''Bachur Khokani'' was captured and imprisoned but on 20 February, fifty kolis attacked the jail and released the rebel Khokani by killing the police officers in the battle. Thereafter, british official ''R. Holford'' made a plane to raised a army of non-koli locals for [[East India Company|EIC]] to prevent the koli rebels. In 1810, a large number of koli rebels were captured and convicted to the crim against company. The kolis were taken to the [[Prince of Wales Islands]] ([[Penang]]) in the recommendation of judge ''H. W. Riggle'' of british cutchery but some rebels were imprisoned in local jails. A group of koli rebels numbering five hundred under ''Koli Bachur Khokani'' attacked the jails and released the rebels it was most daring event in the [[History of Gujarat]]. Again kolis ravaged the dholka and british stationed the more army but no control on kolis. The company sought the help from [[Baroda State]] of [[Gaekwad dynasty|Gaekwads]] but not able to prevent the rebels so company forced the non-koli local chiefs but there was no goid result. In 1824, the [[Ahmedabad]] magistrate ''A. Crawford'' suggested the company to take the possessions of koli chiefs ([[Thakur (title)|Thakors]]) because of involving or supporting the/in koli rebellion. But nobody of the koli chiefs were feared thereafter company used the military against koli chieftains and burnt down their villages and this strategy became more useful for company. The idea of destroying the villages of ''A. Crawford'' didn't prevent the kolis from challenging the company rule but kolis became more turbulent and continued to the rebellion. In 1830, ''Crawford'' made policies for kolis but koli chieftains not seems to be improved but always ready to plunder but in 1840 kolis involved in agriculture.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nAfter the muslim rule, kolis ravaged the [[British Raj]] in [[British India]]. Here is a historical rebellion of kolis which was led by a koli [[Bhagat]] named [[Govindas Ramdas]] who was a worshiper of lord [[Rama]] and [[Krishna]]. He led his followers (most of them were kolis) against british government. He declared the end of british rule in india and declined to obey the orders. On 17 march 1826, Bhagat marched to the [[Thasra]] near [[Dakor]]e with armed kolis. There were no difficulties for rebels and ''Govindas Ramdas'' proclaimed himself as ruler (''Koli Thakor)'' of Thasra. <ref name=\":17\">{{Cite book|last=Chaturvedi|first=Vinayak|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=MzPlZSOjCpsC&pg=PA90&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Peasant Pasts: History and Memory in Western India|date=2007|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-25076-5|language=en}}</ref> he led the kolis 1826 to 1830 as a ruler.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDuring the ''Great [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]],'' the kolis of [[Nashik district]] in [[Maharashtra]] rebelled in the ''Petty Princely State Of [[Peint]]'' also spelled ''Penth and Peth .'' peint was a [[Jagir]]'' '' of twenty four vilages and ruled by koli king ''Bhagvant Rao'' also knowns as ''Bhargav Rav .''<ref>{{Cite book|last=Deshpande|first=Arvind M.|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=79sS_w_bOQYC&pg=PA154&lpg=PA154&dq=Koli+Raja+Peint&source=bl&ots=Vf7J9ivfZy&sig=ACfU3U3qQfAfE5epilPBBXeDIE0DOCmSvQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwit3crjnt_oAhU9H7cAHd_1AcYQ6AEwDnoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=Koli%20Raja%20Peint&f=false|title=John Briggs in Maharashtra: A Study of District Administration Under Early British Rule|date=1987|publisher=Mittal Publications|language=en}}</ref> the rebellion was raised by it's koli chief, queen and her [[Dewan|Diwan]]'' '' in the lead of ''Bhagojee Naik and Bhow Patel Malekar'' (both koli) to collapse the british rule.

Both clans were very proud of the purity of their royal blood and had practised this tradition of inter-marriage since ancient times. For example, [[\u015buddhodana|Suddhodana's]] paternal aunt was married to the Koliyan ruler [[A\u00f1jana]]. Their daughters, [[Mayadevi|Mahamaya]] and [[Mahaprajapati|Mahapajapati Gotami]], were married to [[\u015auddhodana]], the chief of the [[Shakya|Sakyans]]. Similarly, [[Yashodhara]], daughter of [[Suppabuddha]], who was [[A\u00f1jana]]'s son, was married to the Sakyan prince, [[Gautama Buddha]]. Thus, the two royal families were related by marriage bonds between maternal and paternal cousins since ancient times. In spite of such close blood-ties, there would be occasional rifts between the two royal families, which sometimes turned into open hostility.\n\n=== Early ===\nRecords of Koli people exist from at least the 15th century, when rulers in the present-day Gujarat region noted their chieftains as being marauding robbers and [[dacoit]]s. According to the historical anthropology [[Susan Bayly]] of [[University of Cambridge]] states that this is the [[Kshatriya]] of [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] and uppar [[India]]. Until tye 1940, kolis were considered as criminal stocks and mostly used for police and military by rulers and authorities. Some of them engaged in marketing as [[Vaishya]] and a large number engaged in agriculture and as soldier. They have gained prominence from islamic india and were political strong and petty rulers from koli community were vested the titles of [[Thakor]] and [[Girasia]] which means ''Girasdar'' or collector of tax from his territory.<ref name=\":19\">{{Cite book|last=Bayly|first=Susan|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=HbAjKR_iHogC&source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Caste, Society and Politics in India from the Eighteenth Century to the Modern Age|date=2001-02-22|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-79842-6|language=en}}</ref>\n\nFrom the mughal time, kolis were most notorious for rulers. so a [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] chronicler mentioned that the kolis of gujarat raised against mughal rule. One of the most remembered event in the history is the battle between mughal [[Governor-general]] of gujarat ''Abdulla Khan'' and unruly koli [[Zamindar]] [[Thakor]] Lal Koli who gave too much trouble to the imperial authority of sultanate. There was a war between koli zamidar and faijdar of sultanate. Abdulla Khan commanded the imperial army against kolis with 3000 horses and 12000 foot soldiers to in the battle but koli zamidar didn't declined the battle and there was a blood struggle and victory declared to the Abdulla Khan and the head of koli zamidar lal thakor was hanged at the one of the gate ahmedabad in 1615.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Dow|first=Alexander|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=Dbe7uGnCbT8C&pg=PA26&lpg=PA26&dq=Abdulla+Khan+1615&source=bl&ots=SHL6fS0fX1&sig=ACfU3U2cmbLrOpY_OczmHfnZHQWwZQkMtg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi05Kfs39_oAhWc73MBHX_GB84Q6AEwD3oECAQQAQ#v=onepage&q=Abdulla%20Khan%201615&f=false|title=The history of Hindustan|last2=Dahiya|first2=B.

In 1650, kolis revolted against sultan [[Aurangzeb]] because of [[Jizya]] taxes on [[Zamindar]]s. It was a big turning point in the history of kolis because after this Rebellion, kolis were highly reputed in the [[Maratha Navy]], [[Maratha Army]] and [[Maratha Empire]]. This Rebellion was a good and big chance for [[Maratha emperors|Maratha Emporer]] the [[Shivaji]] to shake the aurangzeb. In 1650, kolis revolted under their koli chief ''Khemi Sarnaik'' with the supportive words of shivaji maharaj. firstly Sarnaik assembled the other koli [[Nayak (title)|Naiks]] to end the mughal rule and promised them to end the rule in only first rebellion. In the starting of revolt, kolis under Sarnaik shaked the sultan Aurangzeb but latter they were hunted by lacks of mughal soldiers. Sarnaik sought the help from shivaji maharaj but kolis were not helped by maratha emporer. The ''Khemi Sarnaik'' was killed by mughal commander thereafter the family members also were killed by the order of aurangzeb and then the kolis of same clan as Sarnaik were searched and killed. The end of koli rebellion was very haunted, thousands of the kolis were captured and taken to [[Junnar]] to the mughal [[Faujdar]] where their heads were cutoff at a one place. But latter sultan Aurangzeb erected an monument at the heads of kolis named ''<nowiki/>'Koli Chabutra''' and Jiziya tax was stopped. After this, kolis were received high positions in maratha empire such as ''Kanhoji Angre'' who was admiral of maratha navy, ''Tanaji Malusare'', a commander in maratha army and ''Suryaji Malusare, Kondaji Ramji Shelar and Lai Patil'' were notable personalities from martha army and navy.<ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThree of the major uprisings of kolis were in the years of 1694, 1721 and 1729 against muslim rule, the kolis of gujarat continually challenged the mighal authority. A [[Babi dynasty|Babi]] Muhammad Mubariz Khan (ancestor of [[Junagadh State]] family) of pasthoon tribe was appointed as governor of the [[Vadnagar]] and ordered to control the koli's turbulent activities. Kolis were in rebellion against muslim rule so Mubariz khan commanded the imperial army against kolis of sampra was but he was killed by kolis of that village.\n\nsecond in 1721,the kolis of [[Pethapur State|Pethapur]] challenged the mughal authority. They plundered the merchants and villages. The governor of [[Kheda]] was ordered to subdue the kolis but in the batyle at pethapur in 1721 kolis killed governor ''Kasim Ali Khan'' in action. Third in 1729, the kolis of [[Radhanpur]] revolted against the mughals in gujarat. A [[Babi dynasty|Babi]] of radhanpur assisted the mughals in gujarat and he was appointed as the governor of Radhanpur with the title of ''Jawan Marad Khan'' and founded the [[Radhanpur State]] as independent ruler. Kolis of his territory were in revolt wind already against mughals. Kolis infested the roads, blocked the minor ways, plundered the villages and challenged the authority. The first [[Nawab]] of radhanpur Jawan Marad Khan was ordered by sultan to put down the kolis. Khan marched against kolis of ''Balor'' in his territory and happened a critical struggle between nawab and kolis. But nawab was killed in action by the kolis of balor.<ref name=\":24\" /><ref name=\":23\" />\n\nin the later part of [[18th century]], the ''Khant Kolis'' rebelled against [[Muslims|Muslim]] rule in [[Junagadh State]] whose ruler was faujdar of mughals. The kolis of [[Junagadh]] revolted under a khant koli named ''Mansa Khant'' who shaked the junagadh government and muslim ruler. The [[Nawab]] of junagadh was unable to prevent the khant kolis. Mansa khant captured the [[Uparkot Fort]] from nawab. After this occurrence, nawab sought the help from [[Rajput]] ruler of [[Gondal State]] and the British government to put down the kolis thereafter combined forces of the british, junagadh and gondal attacked the uparkot fort and burnt the koli rebellion.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":15\" />\n\nThe kolis continued to their fight, a similar rebellion also mentioned in the pages of history of maharashtra. In 1761, kolis of [[Sahyadri]] revolted against [[Nizam of Hyderabad]]. A storming party of kolis under their chiefs ''Gamaji Bhangre and Kheroji Pattikar'' captured the [[Trimbak|Trimbak Fort]] from [[Hyderabad State]] and annexed the fort in maratha Empire. It shows the contributions of kolis in the standing of maratha empire thereafter both of the koli chiefs were rewarded with the grants of a large sum of money and many villages with the titles of [[Deshmukh]] and [[Patil (title)|Patil]] by [[Peshwa]].<ref name=\":11\" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=The Executive Editor And Secretary|first=Gazetteers Department|url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.7537|title=Maharastra State Gazetteers Ahmednagar District|date=1976}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cultural.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/Ahmadnagar/people_castes.html|title=Maharashtra government|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of [[19th century]] in 1803, there was a koli rebellion against [[East India Company]] in [[Kheda district]]. The british officials declared the dharala kolis most turbulent and predatory tribe of india. They kolis of kheda didn't obey the rules of British government and plundered the villages and towns in British territory and claimed a costmary right to plunder the villages like their forfathers. The district magistrate informed the officials that plundering right in not new to kolis it is a traditional way of collecting the tax from villages from ancient time of kolis. In 1808, koli chiefs such as ''Koli Thakors and Koli Patels'' started the invading the villages and stealing the crops and other possessions mostly in the [[Dholka Taluka]] and neighboring villages of british Territory with the groups of the hundreds of the armed kolis without any difficulties. On February 1808, one of the koli named ''Bachur Khokani'' was captured and imprisoned but on 20 February, fifty kolis attacked the jail and released the rebel Khokani by killing the police officers in the battle. Thereafter, british official ''R. Holford'' made a plane to raised a army of non-koli locals for [[East India Company|EIC]] to prevent the koli rebels. In 1810, a large number of koli rebels were captured and convicted to the crim against company. The kolis were taken to the [[Prince of Wales Islands]] ([[Penang]]) in the recommendation of judge ''H. W. Riggle'' of british cutchery but some rebels were imprisoned in local jails. A group of koli rebels numbering five hundred under ''Koli Bachur Khokani'' attacked the jails and released the rebels it was most daring event in the [[History of Gujarat]]. Again kolis ravaged the dholka and british stationed the more army but no control on kolis. The company sought the help from [[Baroda State]] of [[Gaekwad dynasty|Gaekwads]] but not able to prevent the rebels so company forced the non-koli local chiefs but there was no goid result. In 1824, the [[Ahmedabad]] magistrate ''A. Crawford'' suggested the company to take the possessions of koli chiefs ([[Thakur (title)|Thakors]]) because of involving or supporting the/in koli rebellion. But nobody of the koli chiefs were feared thereafter company used the military against koli chieftains and burnt down their villages and this strategy became more useful for company. The idea of destroying the villages of ''A. Crawford'' didn't prevent the kolis from challenging the company rule but kolis became more turbulent and continued to the rebellion. In 1830, ''Crawford'' made policies for kolis but koli chieftains not seems to be improved but always ready to plunder but in 1840 kolis involved in agriculture.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nAfter the muslim rule, kolis ravaged the [[British Raj]] in [[British India]]. Here is a historical rebellion of kolis which was led by a koli [[Bhagat]] named [[Govindas Ramdas]] who was a worshiper of lord [[Rama]] and [[Krishna]]. He led his followers (most of them were kolis) against british government. He declared the end of british rule in india and declined to obey the orders. On 17 march 1826, Bhagat marched to the [[Thasra]] near [[Dakor]]e with armed kolis. There were no difficulties for rebels and ''Govindas Ramdas'' proclaimed himself as ruler (''Koli Thakor)'' of Thasra. <ref name=\":17\">{{Cite book|last=Chaturvedi|first=Vinayak|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=MzPlZSOjCpsC&pg=PA90&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Peasant Pasts: History and Memory in Western India|date=2007|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-25076-5|language=en}}</ref> he led the kolis 1826 to 1830 as a ruler.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDuring the ''Great [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]],'' the kolis of [[Nashik district]] in [[Maharashtra]] rebelled in the ''Petty Princely State Of [[Peint]]'' also spelled ''Penth and Peth .'' peint was a [[Jagir]]'' '' of twenty four vilages and ruled by koli king ''Bhagvant Rao'' also knowns as ''Bhargav Rav .''<ref>{{Cite book|last=Deshpande|first=Arvind M.|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=79sS_w_bOQYC&pg=PA154&lpg=PA154&dq=Koli+Raja+Peint&source=bl&ots=Vf7J9ivfZy&sig=ACfU3U3qQfAfE5epilPBBXeDIE0DOCmSvQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwit3crjnt_oAhU9H7cAHd_1AcYQ6AEwDnoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=Koli%20Raja%20Peint&f=false|title=John Briggs in Maharashtra: A Study of District Administration Under Early British Rule|date=1987|publisher=Mittal Publications|language=en}}</ref> the rebellion was raised by it's koli chief, queen and her [[Dewan|Diwan]]'' '' in the lead of ''Bhagojee Naik and Bhow Patel Malekar'' (both koli) to collapse the british rule.

It has associations with [[forward rate agreement|forward rate agreements (FRAs)]], and with [[zero coupon swap|zero coupon swaps (ZCSs)]].\n\nIn its December 2014 statistics release, the [[Bank for International Settlements]] reported that interest rate swaps were the largest component of the global [[Over-the-counter (finance)|OTC]] [[Derivative (finance)|derivative]] market, representing 60%, with the [[notional amount]] outstanding in OTC interest rate swaps of $381 trillion, and the gross market value of $14 trillion.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bis.org/publ/otc_hy1504.pdf|title=OTC derivatives statistics at end-December 2014|publisher=Bank for International Settlements}}</ref>\n\nInterest rate swaps can be traded as an index through the [[FTSE MTIRS Index]].\n\n==Interest rate swaps==\n===General description===\n[[File:IRSflows.png|frame|right|upright=1.0|Graphical depiction of IRS cashflows between two counterparties based on a notional amount of EUR100mm for a single (i'th) period exchange, where the floating index <math>r_i</math> will typically be an -IBOR index.]]\nAn interest rate swap's (IRS's) effective description is a derivative contract, agreed between two [[counterparty|counterparties]], which specifies the nature of an exchange of payments benchmarked against an interest rate index. \nThe most common IRS is a fixed for floating swap, whereby one party will make payments to the other based on an initially agreed fixed rate of interest, to receive back payments based on a floating interest rate index. \nEach of these series of payments is termed a \"leg\", so a typical IRS has both a fixed and a floating leg. \nThe floating index is commonly an [[interbank rate|interbank offered rate]] (IBOR) of specific tenor in the appropriate currency of the IRS, for example [[LIBOR]] in USD, GBP, [[EURIBOR]] in EUR, or STIBOR in SEK.\n\nTo completely determine any IRS a number of parameters must be specified for each leg: <ref name=PTIRDs>[http://www.tradinginterestrates.com Pricing and Trading Interest Rate Derivatives: A Practical Guide to Swaps], J H M Darbyshire, 2017, {{ISBN|978-0995455528}}</ref>\n*the [[notional principal amount]] (or varying notional schedule);

These are typically termed (single currency) [[basis swap]]s (SBSs). The legs on SBSs will necessarily be different interest indexes, such as 1M, LIBOR, 3M LIBOR, 6M LIBOR, SONIA, etc. The pricing of these swaps requires a '''spread''' often quoted in basis points to be added to one of the floating legs in order to satisfy value equivalence.\n\n===Uses===\nInterest rate swaps are used to hedge against or speculate on changes in interest rates.\n\nInterest rate swaps are also used speculatively by hedge funds or other investors who expect a change in interest rates or the relationships between them. Traditionally, fixed income investors who expected rates to fall would purchase cash bonds, whose value increased as rates fell. Today, investors with a similar view could enter a floating-for-fixed interest rate swap; as rates fall, investors would pay a lower floating rate in exchange for the same fixed rate.\n\nInterest rate swaps are also popular for the [[arbitrage]] opportunities they provide. Varying levels of [[creditworthiness]] means that there is often a positive [[quality spread differential]] that allows both parties to benefit from an interest rate swap.\n\nThe interest rate swap market in USD is closely linked to the [[Eurodollar]] futures market which trades among others at the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]].\n\n==Valuation and pricing==\n{{further information|Rational pricing#Swaps}}\nIRSs are bespoke financial products whose customisation can include changes to payment dates, notional changes (such as those in amortised IRSs), accrual period adjustment and calculation convention changes (such as a [[day count convention]] of 30/360E to ACT/360 or ACT/365).\n\nA vanilla IRS is the term used for standardised IRSs. Typically these will have none of the above customisations, and instead exhibit constant notional throughout, implied payment and accrual dates and benchmark calculation conventions by currency.<ref name=PTIRDs /> A vanilla IRS is also characterised by one leg being 'fixed' and the second leg 'floating' referencing an -IBOR index. The net [[present value]] (PV) of a vanilla IRS can be computed by determining the PV of each fixed leg and floating leg separately and summing. For pricing a mid-market IRS the underlying principle is that the two legs must have the same value initially; see further [[Rational pricing#Valuation at initiation|under Rational pricing]].\n\nCalculating the fixed leg requires discounting all of the known cashflows by an appropriate discount factor:\n\n:<math>P_\\text{fixed} = N  R  \\sum_{i=1}^{n_1} d_i v_i</math>\nwhere <math>N</math> is the notional, <math>R</math> is the fixed rate, <math>n_1</math> is the number of payments, <math>d_i</math> is the decimalised day count fraction of the accrual in the i'th period, and <math>v_i</math> is the discount factor associated with the payment date of the i'th period.\n\nCalculating the floating leg is a similar process replacing the fixed rate with forecast index rates:\n:<math>P_\\text{float} = N \\sum_{j=1}^{n_2} r_j d_j v_j</math>\nwhere <math>n_2</math> is the number of payments of the floating leg and <math>r_j</math> are the forecast -IBOR index rates of the appropriate currency.\n\nThe PV of the IRS from the perspective of receiving the fixed leg is then:\n:<math>P_\\text{IRS} = P_\\text{fixed} - P_\\text{float}</math>\n\nHistorically IRSs were valued using discount factors derived from the same curve used to forecast the -IBOR rates. This has been called 'self-discounted'. Some early literature described some incoherence introduced by that approach and multiple banks were using different techniques to reduce them.  It became more apparent with the [[2007\u20132012 global financial crisis]] that the approach was not appropriate, and alignment towards discount factors associated with physical [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] of the IRSs was needed.\n\nPost crisis, to accommodate credit risk, the now-standard pricing framework is the '''multi-curve framework''' where forecast -IBOR rates and discount factors exhibit disparity. \nNote that the economic pricing principle is unchanged: leg values are still identical at initiation. See [[Financial economics#Derivative pricing|Financial economics \u00a7 Derivative pricing]] for further context. \nHere, [[Overnight index swap|Overnight Index Swap]] (OIS) rates are typically used to derive discount factors, since that index is the standard inclusion on [[Credit Support Annex]]es (CSAs) to determine the rate of interest payable on collateral for IRS contracts. As regards the rates forecast, since  the [[LIBOR\u2013OIS spread|basis spread]] between [[LIBOR]] rates of different maturities widened during the crisis, forecast curves are generally constructed for each [[Libor#Maturities|LIBOR tenor]] used in floating rate derivative legs.<ref>[https://www.kpmg.com/Global/en/IssuesAndInsights/ArticlesPublications/Documents/multi-curve-valuation-approaches-part-1.pdf Multi-Curve Valuation Approaches and their Application to Hedge Accounting according to IAS 39], Dr. Dirk Schubert, [[KPMG]]</ref> \n\nRegarding the curve build, see \n<ref>M.

[https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3009281 ''FX Forward Invariance & Discounting with CSA Collateral'']</ref>\n\nThe complexities of modern curvesets mean that there may not be discount factors available for a specific -IBOR index curve. These curves are known as 'forecast only' curves and only contain the information of a forecast -IBOR index rate for any future date. Some designs constructed with a discount based methodology mean forecast -IBOR index rates are implied by the discount factors inherent to that curve:\n:<math>r_j = \\frac{1}{d_j} \\left ( \\frac{x_{j-1}}{x_j} - 1 \\right ) \n</math> where <math>x_{i-1}</math> and <math>x_{i}</math> are the start and end ''discount factors'' associated with the relevant forward curve of a particular -IBOR index in a given currency.\n\nTo price the mid-market or par rate, <math>S</math> of an IRS (defined by the value of fixed rate <math>R</math> that gives a net PV of zero),  the above formula is re-arranged to:\n:<math>S = \\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^{n_2}r_j d_j v_j}{ \\sum_{i=1}^{n_1} d_i v_i}</math>\n\nIn the event old methodologies are applied the discount factors <math>v_k</math> can be replaced with the self discounted values <math>x_k</math> and the above reduces to:\n:<math>S = \\frac{x_0 - x_{n_2}}{ \\sum_{i=1}^{n_1} d_i x_i}</math>\n\nIn both cases, the PV of a general swap can be expressed exactly with the following intuitive formula:\n:<math>P_\\text{IRS} = N(R-S)A</math> \nwhere <math>A</math> is the so-called [[Annuity]] factor <math>A = \\sum_{i=1}^{n_1} d_i v_i</math> (or <math>A = \\sum_{i=1}^{n_1} d_i x_i</math> for self-discounting).  This shows that the PV of an IRS is roughly linear in the swap par rate (though small non-linearities arise from the co-dependency of the swap rate with the discount factors in the Annuity sum). \n\nDuring the life of the swap the same valuation technique is used, but since, over time, both the discounting factors and the forward rates change, the PV of the swap will deviate from its initial value. Therefore, the swap will be an asset to one party and a liability to the other. \nThe way these changes in value are reported is the subject of [[IAS 39]] for jurisdictions following [[International Financial Reporting Standards|IFRS]], and [[FAS 133]] for [[U.S. GAAP]]. \nSwaps are marked to market by debt security traders to visualize their inventory at a certain time. \nAs regards [[PnL Explained #Sensitivities method|P&L Attribution]], and hedging, the new framework adds complexity in that the trader's position is now potentially affected by numerous instruments not obviously related to the trade in question.\n\n==Risks==\nInterest rate swaps expose users to many different types of financial risk.<ref name=PTIRDs /> \nPredominantly they expose the user to [[market risk]]s and specifically [[interest rate risk]]. \nThe value of an interest rate swap will change as market interest rates rise and fall. In market terminology this is often referred to as [[Greeks_(finance)#Delta|delta risk]]. \nInterest rate swaps also exhibit [[Greeks_(finance)#Gamma|gamma risk]] whereby their delta risk increases or decreases as market interest rates fluctuate. \n(See [[Greeks (finance)]], [[Value at risk #Computation methods]], [[Value at risk #VaR risk management]]. )\n\nOther specific types of market risk that interest rate swaps have exposure to are [[basis risk]]s - where various IBOR tenor indexes can deviate from one another - \nand [[Repricing risk|reset risks]] - where the [[Libor#Calculation|publication of specific tenor IBOR indexes]] are subject to daily fluctuation. \n\nUncollateralised interest rate swaps - those executed bilaterally without a CSA in place - expose the trading counterparties to funding risks and [[credit risk]]s. \nFunding risks because the value of the swap might deviate to become so negative that it is unaffordable and cannot be funded. \nCredit risks because the respective counterparty, for whom the value of the swap is positive, will be concerned about the opposing counterparty defaulting on its obligations. Collateralised interest rate swaps, on the other hand,  expose the users to collateral risks: here, depending upon the terms of the CSA, the type of posted collateral that is permitted might become more or less expensive due to other extraneous market movements. \n\nCredit and funding risks still exist for collateralised trades but to a much lesser extent. \nRegardless, due to regulations set out in the [[Basel III]] Regulatory Frameworks, trading interest rate derivatives [[regulatory capital|commands a capital usage]]. The consequence of this is that, dependent upon their specific nature, interest rate swaps might command more capital usage, and this can deviate with market movements. Thus capital risks are another concern for users. \n\nGiven these concerns, banks will typically calculate a [[credit valuation adjustment]], as well as other [[XVA|x-valuation adjustment]]s, which then incorporate these risks into the instrument value.\n\nReputation risks also exist. The mis-selling of swaps, over-exposure of municipalities to derivative contracts, and IBOR manipulation are examples of high-profile cases where trading interest rate swaps has led to a loss of reputation and fines by regulators.\n\nHedging interest rate swaps can be complicated and relies on numerical processes of well designed risk models to suggest reliable benchmark trades that mitigate all market risks; although, see the discussion above re hedging in a multi-curve environment. The other, aforementioned risks must be hedged using other systematic processes.\n\n==Quotation and Market-Making==\n=== ISDA Benchmark Swap Rates ===\nISDA, ICAP, and Reuters select a number of swap dealers based on their reputation, credit standing and scale of activity in each major currency. Those dealers are asked to provide swap rates for the designated maturities of a given currency within a polling window. Reuters will calculate the benchmark swap rate based on a simple average of the submitted rates after eliminating the highest and lowest ones and publish them. \n\n===Market-Making===\nThe market-making of IRSs is an involved process involving multiple tasks; curve construction with reference to interbank markets, individual derivative contract pricing, risk management of credit, cash and capital. The cross disciplines required include quantitative analysis and mathematical expertise, disciplined and organized approach towards profits and losses, and coherent psychological and subjective assessment of financial market information and price-taker analysis. The time sensitive nature of markets also creates a pressurized environment. Many tools and techniques have been designed to improve efficiency of market-making in a drive to efficiency and consistency.<ref name=PTIRDs />\n\n==Controversy==\n\nIn June 1988 the [[Audit Commission (United Kingdom)|Audit Commission]] was tipped off by someone working on the swaps desk of [[Goldman Sachs]] that the [[London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham]] had a massive exposure to interest rate swaps. When the commission contacted the council, the chief executive told them not to worry as \"everybody knows that interest rates are going to fall\"; the treasurer thought the interest rate swaps were a \"nice little earner\". The Commission's Controller, [[Howard Davies (economist)|Howard Davies]], realised that the council had put all of its positions on interest rates going down and ordered an investigation.\n\nBy January 1989 the Commission obtained legal opinions from two [[Queen's Counsel]]. Although they did not agree, the commission preferred the opinion that it was ''[[ultra vires]]'' for councils to engage in interest rate swaps (ie. that they had no lawful power to do so). Moreover, interest rates had increased from 8% to 15%. The auditor and the commission then went to court and had the contracts declared void (appeals all the way up to the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] failed in ''[[Hazell v Hammersmith and Fulham LBC]]''); the five banks involved lost millions of pounds. Many other local authorities had been engaging in interest rate swaps in the 1980s.<ref name=\"Audit Commission\">Duncan Campbell-Smith, \"Follow the Money: The Audit Commission, Public Money, and the Management of Public Services 1983-2008\", Allen Lane, 2008, chapter 6 ''passim''.</ref> This resulted in several cases in which the banks generally lost their claims for [[compound interest]] on debts to councils, finalised in ''[[Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington London Borough Council]]''.<ref>[1996] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1996/12.html UKHL 12], [1996] AC 669</ref> Banks did, however, recover some funds where the derivatives were \"in the money\" for the Councils (ie, an asset showing a profit for the council, which it now had to return to the bank, not a debt)\n\nThe controversy surrounding interest rate swaps reached a peak in the UK during the financial crisis where banks sold unsuitable interest rate hedging products on a large scale to SMEs. The practice has been widely [https://lexlaw.co.uk/solicitors-london/uk-parliament-condemns-rbs-grg-mistreatment-sme-bank-misconduct-litigation-solicitors-london/ criticised] by the media and Parliament. \n\n==See also==\n* [[Swap rate]]\n* [[Interest rate cap and floor]]\n* [[Equity swap]]\n* [[Total return swap]]\n* [[Inflation derivative]]\n* [[Eurodollar]]\n* [[Constant maturity swap]]\n* [[FTSE MTIRS Index]]\n\n==Further reading==\nGeneral:\n*{{cite book | title = Interest Rate Modeling in Three Volumes | author = Leif B.G.

These are typically termed (single currency) [[basis swap]]s (SBSs). The legs on SBSs will necessarily be different interest indexes, such as 1M, LIBOR, 3M LIBOR, 6M LIBOR, SONIA, etc. The pricing of these swaps requires a '''spread''' often quoted in basis points to be added to one of the floating legs in order to satisfy value equivalence.\n\n===Uses===\nInterest rate swaps are used to hedge against or speculate on changes in interest rates.\n\nInterest rate swaps are also used speculatively by hedge funds or other investors who expect a change in interest rates or the relationships between them. Traditionally, fixed income investors who expected rates to fall would purchase cash bonds, whose value increased as rates fell. Today, investors with a similar view could enter a floating-for-fixed interest rate swap; as rates fall, investors would pay a lower floating rate in exchange for the same fixed rate.\n\nInterest rate swaps are also popular for the [[arbitrage]] opportunities they provide. Varying levels of [[creditworthiness]] means that there is often a positive [[quality spread differential]] that allows both parties to benefit from an interest rate swap.\n\nThe interest rate swap market in USD is closely linked to the [[Eurodollar]] futures market which trades among others at the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]].\n\n==Valuation and pricing==\n{{further information|Rational pricing#Swaps}}\nIRSs are bespoke financial products whose customisation can include changes to payment dates, notional changes (such as those in amortised IRSs), accrual period adjustment and calculation convention changes (such as a [[day count convention]] of 30/360E to ACT/360 or ACT/365).\n\nA vanilla IRS is the term used for standardised IRSs. Typically these will have none of the above customisations, and instead exhibit constant notional throughout, implied payment and accrual dates and benchmark calculation conventions by currency.<ref name=PTIRDs /> A vanilla IRS is also characterised by one leg being 'fixed' and the second leg 'floating' referencing an -IBOR index. The net [[present value]] (PV) of a vanilla IRS can be computed by determining the PV of each fixed leg and floating leg separately and summing. For pricing a mid-market IRS the underlying principle is that the two legs must have the same value initially; see further [[Rational pricing#Valuation at initiation|under Rational pricing]].\n\nCalculating the fixed leg requires discounting all of the known cashflows by an appropriate discount factor:\n\n:<math>P_\\text{fixed} = N  R  \\sum_{i=1}^{n_1} d_i v_i</math>\nwhere <math>N</math> is the notional, <math>R</math> is the fixed rate, <math>n_1</math> is the number of payments, <math>d_i</math> is the decimalised day count fraction of the accrual in the i'th period, and <math>v_i</math> is the discount factor associated with the payment date of the i'th period.\n\nCalculating the floating leg is a similar process replacing the fixed rate with forecast index rates:\n:<math>P_\\text{float} = N \\sum_{j=1}^{n_2} r_j d_j v_j</math>\nwhere <math>n_2</math> is the number of payments of the floating leg and <math>r_j</math> are the forecast -IBOR index rates of the appropriate currency.\n\nThe PV of the IRS from the perspective of receiving the fixed leg is then:\n:<math>P_\\text{IRS} = P_\\text{fixed} - P_\\text{float}</math>\n\nHistorically IRSs were valued using discount factors derived from the same curve used to forecast the -IBOR rates. This has been called 'self-discounted'. Some early literature described some incoherence introduced by that approach and multiple banks were using different techniques to reduce them.  It became more apparent with the [[2007\u20132012 global financial crisis]] that the approach was not appropriate, and alignment towards discount factors associated with physical [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] of the IRSs was needed.\n\nPost crisis, to accommodate credit risk, the now-standard pricing framework is the '''multi-curve framework''' where forecast -IBOR rates and discount factors exhibit disparity. \nNote that the economic pricing principle is unchanged: leg values are still identical at initiation. See [[Financial economics#Derivative pricing|Financial economics \u00a7 Derivative pricing]] for further context. \nHere, [[Overnight index swap|Overnight Index Swap]] (OIS) rates are typically used to derive discount factors, since that index is the standard inclusion on [[Credit Support Annex]]es (CSAs) to determine the rate of interest payable on collateral for IRS contracts. As regards the rates forecast, since  the [[LIBOR\u2013OIS spread|basis spread]] between [[LIBOR]] rates of different maturities widened during the crisis, forecast curves are generally constructed for each [[Libor#Maturities|LIBOR tenor]] used in floating rate derivative legs.<ref>[https://www.kpmg.com/Global/en/IssuesAndInsights/ArticlesPublications/Documents/multi-curve-valuation-approaches-part-1.pdf Multi-Curve Valuation Approaches and their Application to Hedge Accounting according to IAS 39], Dr. Dirk Schubert, [[KPMG]]</ref> \n\nRegarding the curve build, see \n<ref>M.

These curves are known as 'forecast only' curves and only contain the information of a forecast -IBOR index rate for any future date. Some designs constructed with a discount based methodology mean forecast -IBOR index rates are implied by the discount factors inherent to that curve:\n:<math>r_j = \\frac{1}{d_j} \\left ( \\frac{x_{j-1}}{x_j} - 1 \\right ) \n</math> where <math>x_{i-1}</math> and <math>x_{i}</math> are the start and end ''discount factors'' associated with the relevant forward curve of a particular -IBOR index in a given currency.\n\nTo price the mid-market or par rate, <math>S</math> of an IRS (defined by the value of fixed rate <math>R</math> that gives a net PV of zero),  the above formula is re-arranged to:\n:<math>S = \\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^{n_2}r_j d_j v_j}{ \\sum_{i=1}^{n_1} d_i v_i}</math>\n\nIn the event old methodologies are applied the discount factors <math>v_k</math> can be replaced with the self discounted values <math>x_k</math> and the above reduces to:\n:<math>S = \\frac{x_0 - x_{n_2}}{ \\sum_{i=1}^{n_1} d_i x_i}</math>\n\nIn both cases, the PV of a general swap can be expressed exactly with the following intuitive formula:\n:<math>P_\\text{IRS} = N(R-S)A</math> \nwhere <math>A</math> is the so-called [[Annuity]] factor <math>A = \\sum_{i=1}^{n_1} d_i v_i</math> (or <math>A = \\sum_{i=1}^{n_1} d_i x_i</math> for self-discounting).  This shows that the PV of an IRS is roughly linear in the swap par rate (though small non-linearities arise from the co-dependency of the swap rate with the discount factors in the Annuity sum). \n\nDuring the life of the swap the same valuation technique is used, but since, over time, both the discounting factors and the forward rates change, the PV of the swap will deviate from its initial value. Therefore, the swap will be an asset to one party and a liability to the other. \nThe way these changes in value are reported is the subject of [[IAS 39]] for jurisdictions following [[International Financial Reporting Standards|IFRS]], and [[FAS 133]] for [[U.S. GAAP]]. \nSwaps are marked to market by debt security traders to visualize their inventory at a certain time. \nAs regards [[PnL Explained #Sensitivities method|P&L Attribution]], and hedging, the new framework adds complexity in that the trader's position is now potentially affected by numerous instruments not obviously related to the trade in question.\n\n==Risks==\nInterest rate swaps expose users to many different types of financial risk.<ref name=PTIRDs /> \nPredominantly they expose the user to [[market risk]]s and specifically [[interest rate risk]]. \nThe value of an interest rate swap will change as market interest rates rise and fall. In market terminology this is often referred to as [[Greeks_(finance)#Delta|delta risk]]. \nInterest rate swaps also exhibit [[Greeks_(finance)#Gamma|gamma risk]] whereby their delta risk increases or decreases as market interest rates fluctuate. \n(See [[Greeks (finance)]], [[Value at risk #Computation methods]], [[Value at risk #VaR risk management]]. )\n\nOther specific types of market risk that interest rate swaps have exposure to are [[basis risk]]s - where various IBOR tenor indexes can deviate from one another - \nand [[Repricing risk|reset risks]] - where the [[Libor#Calculation|publication of specific tenor IBOR indexes]] are subject to daily fluctuation. \n\nUncollateralised interest rate swaps - those executed bilaterally without a CSA in place - expose the trading counterparties to funding risks and [[credit risk]]s. \nFunding risks because the value of the swap might deviate to become so negative that it is unaffordable and cannot be funded. \nCredit risks because the respective counterparty, for whom the value of the swap is positive, will be concerned about the opposing counterparty defaulting on its obligations. Collateralised interest rate swaps, on the other hand,  expose the users to collateral risks: here, depending upon the terms of the CSA, the type of posted collateral that is permitted might become more or less expensive due to other extraneous market movements. \n\nCredit and funding risks still exist for collateralised trades but to a much lesser extent. \nRegardless, due to regulations set out in the [[Basel III]] Regulatory Frameworks, trading interest rate derivatives [[regulatory capital|commands a capital usage]]. The consequence of this is that, dependent upon their specific nature, interest rate swaps might command more capital usage, and this can deviate with market movements. Thus capital risks are another concern for users. \n\nGiven these concerns, banks will typically calculate a [[credit valuation adjustment]], as well as other [[XVA|x-valuation adjustment]]s, which then incorporate these risks into the instrument value.\n\nReputation risks also exist. The mis-selling of swaps, over-exposure of municipalities to derivative contracts, and IBOR manipulation are examples of high-profile cases where trading interest rate swaps has led to a loss of reputation and fines by regulators.\n\nHedging interest rate swaps can be complicated and relies on numerical processes of well designed risk models to suggest reliable benchmark trades that mitigate all market risks; although, see the discussion above re hedging in a multi-curve environment. The other, aforementioned risks must be hedged using other systematic processes.\n\n==Quotation and Market-Making==\n=== ISDA Benchmark Swap Rates ===\nISDA, ICAP, and Reuters select a number of swap dealers based on their reputation, credit standing and scale of activity in each major currency. Those dealers are asked to provide swap rates for the designated maturities of a given currency within a polling window. Reuters will calculate the benchmark swap rate based on a simple average of the submitted rates after eliminating the highest and lowest ones and publish them. \n\n===Market-Making===\nThe market-making of IRSs is an involved process involving multiple tasks; curve construction with reference to interbank markets, individual derivative contract pricing, risk management of credit, cash and capital. The cross disciplines required include quantitative analysis and mathematical expertise, disciplined and organized approach towards profits and losses, and coherent psychological and subjective assessment of financial market information and price-taker analysis. The time sensitive nature of markets also creates a pressurized environment. Many tools and techniques have been designed to improve efficiency of market-making in a drive to efficiency and consistency.<ref name=PTIRDs />\n\n==Controversy==\n\nIn June 1988 the [[Audit Commission (United Kingdom)|Audit Commission]] was tipped off by someone working on the swaps desk of [[Goldman Sachs]] that the [[London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham]] had a massive exposure to interest rate swaps. When the commission contacted the council, the chief executive told them not to worry as \"everybody knows that interest rates are going to fall\"; the treasurer thought the interest rate swaps were a \"nice little earner\". The Commission's Controller, [[Howard Davies (economist)|Howard Davies]], realised that the council had put all of its positions on interest rates going down and ordered an investigation.\n\nBy January 1989 the Commission obtained legal opinions from two [[Queen's Counsel]]. Although they did not agree, the commission preferred the opinion that it was ''[[ultra vires]]'' for councils to engage in interest rate swaps (ie. that they had no lawful power to do so). Moreover, interest rates had increased from 8% to 15%. The auditor and the commission then went to court and had the contracts declared void (appeals all the way up to the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] failed in ''[[Hazell v Hammersmith and Fulham LBC]]''); the five banks involved lost millions of pounds. Many other local authorities had been engaging in interest rate swaps in the 1980s.<ref name=\"Audit Commission\">Duncan Campbell-Smith, \"Follow the Money: The Audit Commission, Public Money, and the Management of Public Services 1983-2008\", Allen Lane, 2008, chapter 6 ''passim''.</ref> This resulted in several cases in which the banks generally lost their claims for [[compound interest]] on debts to councils, finalised in ''[[Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington London Borough Council]]''.<ref>[1996] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1996/12.html UKHL 12], [1996] AC 669</ref> Banks did, however, recover some funds where the derivatives were \"in the money\" for the Councils (ie, an asset showing a profit for the council, which it now had to return to the bank, not a debt)\n\nThe controversy surrounding interest rate swaps reached a peak in the UK during the financial crisis where banks sold unsuitable interest rate hedging products on a large scale to SMEs. The practice has been widely [https://lexlaw.co.uk/solicitors-london/uk-parliament-condemns-rbs-grg-mistreatment-sme-bank-misconduct-litigation-solicitors-london/ criticised] by the media and Parliament. \n\n==See also==\n* [[Swap rate]]\n* [[Interest rate cap and floor]]\n* [[Equity swap]]\n* [[Total return swap]]\n* [[Inflation derivative]]\n* [[Eurodollar]]\n* [[Constant maturity swap]]\n* [[FTSE MTIRS Index]]\n\n==Further reading==\nGeneral:\n*{{cite book | title = Interest Rate Modeling in Three Volumes | author = Leif B.G.

He is also generally recognized as the last heavyweight champion of [[bare-knuckle boxing]] under the [[London Prize Ring Rules]], being the cultural icon of the [[Timeline of United States history (1860\u20131899)|late 19th century America]], arguably the first boxing [[superstar]] and one of the world's highest-paid athletes of his era. Newspapers coverage of his career, with latest accounts of his championship fights often appeared in the [[headline]]s, and as cover stories, gave birth for the [[sports journalism]] in the United States and set the pattern internationally for covering boxing events in media, and [[photojournalism|photodocumenting]] the prizefights.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpu8H1AH6ek In This Corner \u2014 John L.

This is how I got into the base-ball profession and I left school for good and all. From the base-ball business I drifted into boxing and pugilism.\"<ref name=Tells /></blockquote>\n\n===Early boxing career===\n\nAs a professional fighter Sullivan was nicknamed ''The Boston Strongboy''. As a youth he was arrested several times for participating in bouts where the sport was outlawed. He went on exhibition tours offering people money to fight him. Sullivan won more than 450 fights in his career.\n\nThere is some controversy among boxing historians over whether Sullivan had sparred with black boxer [[James Young (Arizona pioneer)|James Young]] at [[Schieffelin Hall]] in [[Tombstone, Arizona]] in 1882. It is significant because Sullivan insisted that he never fought a black boxer.  If it did occur, Sullivan possibly had a brief sparring session with the resident from Tombstone, and didn't regard it seriously as a bout.<ref name=\"cyberboxingzonedotcom\">{{cite web |url = http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/blog/?p=20758 |title = Tombstone, Arizona: Boxing In The Wild West (1880-84) |work = cyberboxingzone.com |accessdate = November 11, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1883\u201384 Sullivan went on a coast-to-coast tour by train with five other boxers. They were scheduled to hold 195 fights in 136 different cities and towns over 238 days. To help promote the tour, Sullivan announced that he would box anyone at any time during the tour under the [[Marquess of Queensberry Rules|Queensberry Rules]] for $250. He [[knockout|knocked out]] eleven men during the tour.\n\nIn Sullivan's era, no formal boxing titles existed. He became a champion after defeating [[Paddy Ryan]] in [[Mississippi City, Mississippi|Mississippi City]], near [[Gulfport, Mississippi]] on February 7, 1882. Modern authorities have retroactively labelled Ryan the \"Heavyweight Champion of America\", but any claim to Ryan's being a \"world champion\" would have been dubious; he had never contended internationally as Sullivan had.\n\nDepending on the modern authority, Sullivan was first considered world heavyweight champion either in 1888 when he fought [[Charley Mitchell (boxer)|Charley Mitchell]] in France, or in 1889 when he knocked out [[Jake Kilrain]] in round 75 of a scheduled 80-round bout. Arguably the real first World Heavyweight champion was [[Jem Mace]], who defeated Tom Allen in 1870 at [[Kenner, Louisiana]], but strong anti-British sentiment within the mostly Irish-American boxing community of the time chose to disregard him.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n\nWhen the modern authorities write of the \"heavyweight championship of the world,\" they are likely referring to the championship belt presented to Sullivan in [[Boston]] on August 8, 1887. The belt was inscribed ''Presented to the Champion of Champions, John L. Sullivan, by the Citizens of the United States''. Its centerpiece featured the flags of the US, Ireland, and the United Kingdom.\n\nMitchell came from [[Birmingham]], England and fought Sullivan in 1883, knocking him down in the first round. Their third meeting took place in 1888 on the grounds of a chateau at [[Chantilly, Oise|Chantilly]], France, with the fight held in driving rain. It went on for more than two hours, and by the end of the bout, both men were unrecognisable and had suffered so much damage that neither could lift their arms up to punch. Both men couldn't continue and the contest was considered a draw.\n\nAt this point, the local [[National Gendarmerie|gendarmerie]] arrived and arrested Mitchell. He was confined to jail for a few days and later fined by the local magistrate,{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} as bare-knuckle boxing was illegal in France at that time.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Swathed in bandages, Sullivan was helped to evade the law and taken across the [[English Channel]] to spend the next few weeks convalescing in [[Liverpool]].\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Paddy Ryan old judge.jpg|[[Paddy Ryan]] in 1887\nFile:CharlieMitchell.jpg|[[Charley Mitchell (boxer)|Charley Mitchell]]\nFile:Jake Kilrain.jpg|[[Jake Kilrain]] in 1899\nFile:John Corbett boxer.jpg|[[James J.

It was also one of the first sporting events in the United States to receive national press coverage.\n\nFor the first time, newspapers carried extensive pre-fight coverage which included reporting on the fighters' training and speculating on where the bout would take place. The traditional center of bare-knuckle fighting was [[New Orleans]], but the governor of [[Louisiana]] had forbidden the fight in that state. Sullivan had trained for months in [[Belfast, New York]] under trainer [[William Muldoon]], whose biggest problem had been keeping Sullivan from liquor. A report on Sullivan's training regimen in Belfast was written by famed reporter [[Nellie Bly]] and published in the ''[[New York World]].''<ref name=\"Bly\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bareknuckleboxinghalloffame.com/id2.html |title=A Visit with John L.

In Belfast village, the cry was heard, \"John L. is loose again! Send for Muldoon!\" Muldoon would snatch the champ away from the bar and take him back to their training camp.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nOn July 8, 1889, an estimated 3000 spectators boarded special trains for the secret location, which turned out to be Richburg, a town just south of [[Hattiesburg, Mississippi]]. The fight began at 10:30, and at first it looked like Sullivan was going to lose, especially after he vomited during the 44th round. However, the champion got his [[second wind]] and was able to turn things around for himself. After a grueling beatdown, Kilrain's manager finally threw in the towel after the 75th round.\n\nToday, a historical marker is located at the site of the fight, just off [[Interstate 59]], and the fight is immortalised by the Sullivan-Kilrain Road which runs through the site of the event, at the corner of Richburg Road.\n\n===Later career===\n[[File:John L. Sullivan 1898.jpg|right|thumb|Sullivan as he appeared in 1898, late in his career]]\n\nUndefeated at that point, Sullivan did not defend his title for the next four years.  During this period, he was a friend and supporter of Irish boxer [[Ike Weir]], who became America's first Featherweight boxing champion in 1889.  Both Weir and Sullivan were Boston natives, and Sullivan occasionally appeared at Weir's bouts.\n\nSullivan agreed to defend his title in 1892, against challenger [[James J. Corbett|\"Gentleman Jim\" Corbett]].  The match was on 7 September in [[New Orleans]].  It began at 9 p.m. in the electrically illuminated [[Olympic Club, New Orleans|Olympic Club]] in the upper Ninth Ward neighborhood now known as [[Bywater, New Orleans|Bywater section]]. The venue filled to its 10,000 person capacity despite hefty ticket prices ranging from $5 to $15 (approximately $142 to $426 in 2020).  The heavyweight contest occurred under the [[Marquess of Queensberry Rules]], but it was neither the first title fight under those rules nor was it the first title fight using boxing gloves. Corbett was younger and faster, and his boxing technique enabled him to dodge Sullivan's crouch and rush style.  In the 21st round, Corbett landed a smashing left \"audible throughout the house\" that put Sullivan down for good. Sullivan was counted out and Corbett was then declared the new champion.  When Sullivan was able to get back to his feet, he announced to the crowd the following: \"If I had to get licked, I'm glad I was licked by an American\".<ref>[http://www.ibhof.com/ibhfhvy2.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916232117/http://www.ibhof.com/ibhfhvy2.htm |date=September 16, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:SullivanCorbettBubbleMascot.JPG|left|thumb|Corbett licks Sullivan.]]\nSullivan is considered the last bare-knuckle champion because no champion after him fought bare-knuckled. However, Sullivan had fought with gloves under the Marquess of Queensberry Rules as early as 1880 and he only fought bare knuckle three times in his entire career (Ryan 1882, Mitchell 1888, and Kilrain 1889). His bare-knuckle image was created because both his infrequent fights from 1888 up to the Corbett fight in 1892 had been bare-knuckle.\n\nSullivan retired to [[Abington, Massachusetts|Abington]], [[Massachusetts]] but appeared in several exhibitions over the next 12 years, including a three-rounder against [[Tom Sharkey]] and a final two-rounder against [[Jim McCormick (pitcher)|Jim McCormick]] in 1905 in [[Grand Rapids]], [[Michigan]]. He continued his various careers outside boxing such as being a stage actor, speaker, celebrity baseball umpire, sports reporter, and bar owner. In his later years, Sullivan also gave up his lifelong addiction to alcohol and became a prohibition lecturer.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=SULLIVAN ON TEMPERANCE.; Ex-Pugllist Says He Wasted $500,000 Through Liquor.\n |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E04EEDF1138E633A25751C0A96E9C946496D6CF&url=http:%2F%2Ftimesmachine.nytimes.com%2Ftimesmachine%2F1915%2F08%2F02%2F100170912.html&legacy=true |work=New York Times |date=1915-08-02 |access-date=2017-07-21 }}</ref>\n\n===Death and legacy===\n\nThe effects of prize fighting along with him being overweight and unhealthy after a long life of overindulging in food and alcohol took its toll on the boxer.

[[Ward Bond]] portrayed Sullivan alternately as a fiery peacock of a heavyweight champion and, after his title loss, as a sweet, sentimental good sport. Sixteen years later, actor [[Roy Jenson]] played Sullivan in the 1958 episode, \"The Gambler and the Lady\", of the [[Television syndication|syndicated television]] [[anthology series]], ''[[Death Valley Days]]'', hosted by [[Stanley Andrews]]. In the story line, Sullivan in his tour of local communities across the country fights an exposition match against Buck Jarrico ([[Hal Baylor]]). When the prize money designated to refurbish the school goes missing, both the teacher, Ruth Stewart ([[Kathleen Case]]), and the gambler, Brad Forrester (Mark Dana), are falsely accused based on appearances.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0556786/|title=The Gambler and the Lady on ''Death Valley Days''|publisher=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=September 4, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Professional boxing record==\n{{BoxingRecordSummary\n|draws=2\n|nc=1\n|ko-wins=38\n|ko-losses=1\n|dec-wins=8\n|dec-losses=0\n|dq-wins=1\n|dq-losses=0\n}}\n{{clear}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%\"\n|-\n!{{abbr|No.|Number}}\n!Result\n!Record\n!Opponent\n!Type\n!Round, time\n!Date\n!Location\n!Notes\n|-\n|51\n|{{no2}}Loss\n|47\u20131\u20132 {{small|(1)}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} [[James J.

This is how I got into the base-ball profession and I left school for good and all. From the base-ball business I drifted into boxing and pugilism.\"<ref name=Tells /></blockquote>\n\n===Early boxing career===\n\nAs a professional fighter Sullivan was nicknamed ''The Boston Strongboy''. As a youth he was arrested several times for participating in bouts where the sport was outlawed. He went on exhibition tours offering people money to fight him. Sullivan won more than 450 fights in his career.\n\nThere is some controversy among boxing historians over whether Sullivan had sparred with black boxer [[James Young (Arizona pioneer)|James Young]] at [[Schieffelin Hall]] in [[Tombstone, Arizona]] in 1882. It is significant because Sullivan insisted that he never fought a black boxer.  If it did occur, Sullivan possibly had a brief sparring session with the resident from Tombstone, and didn't regard it seriously as a bout.<ref name=\"cyberboxingzonedotcom\">{{cite web |url = http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/blog/?p=20758 |title = Tombstone, Arizona: Boxing In The Wild West (1880-84) |work = cyberboxingzone.com |accessdate = November 11, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1883\u201384 Sullivan went on a coast-to-coast tour by train with five other boxers. They were scheduled to hold 195 fights in 136 different cities and towns over 238 days. To help promote the tour, Sullivan announced that he would box anyone at any time during the tour under the [[Marquess of Queensberry Rules|Queensberry Rules]] for $250. He [[knockout|knocked out]] eleven men during the tour.\n\nIn Sullivan's era, no formal boxing titles existed. He became a champion after defeating [[Paddy Ryan]] in [[Mississippi City, Mississippi|Mississippi City]], near [[Gulfport, Mississippi]] on February 7, 1882. Modern authorities have retroactively labelled Ryan the \"Heavyweight Champion of America\", but any claim to Ryan's being a \"world champion\" would have been dubious; he had never contended internationally as Sullivan had.\n\nDepending on the modern authority, Sullivan was first considered world heavyweight champion either in 1888 when he fought [[Charley Mitchell (boxer)|Charley Mitchell]] in France, or in 1889 when he knocked out [[Jake Kilrain]] in round 75 of a scheduled 80-round bout. Arguably the real first World Heavyweight champion was [[Jem Mace]], who defeated Tom Allen in 1870 at [[Kenner, Louisiana]], but strong anti-British sentiment within the mostly Irish-American boxing community of the time chose to disregard him.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n\nWhen the modern authorities write of the \"heavyweight championship of the world,\" they are likely referring to the championship belt presented to Sullivan in [[Boston]] on August 8, 1887. The belt was inscribed ''Presented to the Champion of Champions, John L. Sullivan, by the Citizens of the United States''. Its centerpiece featured the flags of the US, Ireland, and the United Kingdom.\n\nMitchell came from [[Birmingham]], England and fought Sullivan in 1883, knocking him down in the first round. Their third meeting took place in 1888 on the grounds of a chateau at [[Chantilly, Oise|Chantilly]], France, with the fight held in driving rain. It went on for more than two hours, and by the end of the bout, both men were unrecognisable and had suffered so much damage that neither could lift their arms up to punch. Both men couldn't continue and the contest was considered a draw.\n\nAt this point, the local [[National Gendarmerie|gendarmerie]] arrived and arrested Mitchell. He was confined to jail for a few days and later fined by the local magistrate,{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} as bare-knuckle boxing was illegal in France at that time.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Swathed in bandages, Sullivan was helped to evade the law and taken across the [[English Channel]] to spend the next few weeks convalescing in [[Liverpool]].\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Paddy Ryan old judge.jpg|[[Paddy Ryan]] in 1887\nFile:CharlieMitchell.jpg|[[Charley Mitchell (boxer)|Charley Mitchell]]\nFile:Jake Kilrain.jpg|[[Jake Kilrain]] in 1899\nFile:John Corbett boxer.jpg|[[James J.

It was also one of the first sporting events in the United States to receive national press coverage.\n\nFor the first time, newspapers carried extensive pre-fight coverage which included reporting on the fighters' training and speculating on where the bout would take place. The traditional center of bare-knuckle fighting was [[New Orleans]], but the governor of [[Louisiana]] had forbidden the fight in that state. Sullivan had trained for months in [[Belfast, New York]] under trainer [[William Muldoon]], whose biggest problem had been keeping Sullivan from liquor. A report on Sullivan's training regimen in Belfast was written by famed reporter [[Nellie Bly]] and published in the ''[[New York World]].''<ref name=\"Bly\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bareknuckleboxinghalloffame.com/id2.html |title=A Visit with John L.

In Belfast village, the cry was heard, \"John L. is loose again! Send for Muldoon!\" Muldoon would snatch the champ away from the bar and take him back to their training camp.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nOn July 8, 1889, an estimated 3000 spectators boarded special trains for the secret location, which turned out to be Richburg, a town just south of [[Hattiesburg, Mississippi]]. The fight began at 10:30, and at first it looked like Sullivan was going to lose, especially after he vomited during the 44th round. However, the champion got his [[second wind]] and was able to turn things around for himself. After a grueling beatdown, Kilrain's manager finally threw in the towel after the 75th round.\n\nToday, a historical marker is located at the site of the fight, just off [[Interstate 59]], and the fight is immortalised by the Sullivan-Kilrain Road which runs through the site of the event, at the corner of Richburg Road.\n\n===Later career===\n[[File:John L. Sullivan 1898.jpg|right|thumb|Sullivan as he appeared in 1898, late in his career]]\n\nUndefeated at that point, Sullivan did not defend his title for the next four years.  During this period, he was a friend and supporter of Irish boxer [[Ike Weir]], who became America's first Featherweight boxing champion in 1889.  Both Weir and Sullivan were Boston natives, and Sullivan occasionally appeared at Weir's bouts.\n\nSullivan agreed to defend his title in 1892, against challenger [[James J. Corbett|\"Gentleman Jim\" Corbett]].  The match was on 7 September in [[New Orleans]].  It began at 9 p.m. in the electrically illuminated [[Olympic Club, New Orleans|Olympic Club]] in the upper Ninth Ward neighborhood now known as [[Bywater, New Orleans|Bywater section]]. The venue filled to its 10,000 person capacity despite hefty ticket prices ranging from $5 to $15 (approximately $142 to $426 in 2020).  The heavyweight contest occurred under the [[Marquess of Queensberry Rules]], but it was neither the first title fight under those rules nor was it the first title fight using boxing gloves. Corbett was younger and faster, and his boxing technique enabled him to dodge Sullivan's crouch and rush style.  In the 21st round, Corbett landed a smashing left \"audible throughout the house\" that put Sullivan down for good. Sullivan was counted out and Corbett was then declared the new champion.  When Sullivan was able to get back to his feet, he announced to the crowd the following: \"If I had to get licked, I'm glad I was licked by an American\".<ref>[http://www.ibhof.com/ibhfhvy2.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916232117/http://www.ibhof.com/ibhfhvy2.htm |date=September 16, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:SullivanCorbettBubbleMascot.JPG|left|thumb|Corbett licks Sullivan.]]\nSullivan is considered the last bare-knuckle champion because no champion after him fought bare-knuckled. However, Sullivan had fought with gloves under the Marquess of Queensberry Rules as early as 1880 and he only fought bare knuckle three times in his entire career (Ryan 1882, Mitchell 1888, and Kilrain 1889). His bare-knuckle image was created because both his infrequent fights from 1888 up to the Corbett fight in 1892 had been bare-knuckle.\n\nSullivan retired to [[Abington, Massachusetts|Abington]], [[Massachusetts]] but appeared in several exhibitions over the next 12 years, including a three-rounder against [[Tom Sharkey]] and a final two-rounder against [[Jim McCormick (pitcher)|Jim McCormick]] in 1905 in [[Grand Rapids]], [[Michigan]]. He continued his various careers outside boxing such as being a stage actor, speaker, celebrity baseball umpire, sports reporter, and bar owner. In his later years, Sullivan also gave up his lifelong addiction to alcohol and became a prohibition lecturer.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=SULLIVAN ON TEMPERANCE.; Ex-Pugllist Says He Wasted $500,000 Through Liquor.\n |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E04EEDF1138E633A25751C0A96E9C946496D6CF&url=http:%2F%2Ftimesmachine.nytimes.com%2Ftimesmachine%2F1915%2F08%2F02%2F100170912.html&legacy=true |work=New York Times |date=1915-08-02 |access-date=2017-07-21 }}</ref>\n\n===Death and legacy===\n\nThe effects of prize fighting along with him being overweight and unhealthy after a long life of overindulging in food and alcohol took its toll on the boxer. Like most boxers of the time, he did not live a very long life. Sullivan died at age 59 at his home in Abington, Massachusetts, supposedly from heart disease.<ref>[http://johnlsullivan.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-final-hours-of-john-l-sullivan.html The Strong Boy Blog]</ref> At the time of his death, Sullivan had a young boy named Willie Kelly in his custody.

He died with  10 dollars in his pocket (which is equivalent to almost 180 dollars in 2018). According to the county where Sullivan died he had an estate worth $3,675.\n\nSullivan was inducted into the [[International Boxing Hall of Fame]] in 1990, as a member of the hall's original class.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ibhof.com/pages/about/inductees/pioneer/sullivan.html |title=John L.

[[Ward Bond]] portrayed Sullivan alternately as a fiery peacock of a heavyweight champion and, after his title loss, as a sweet, sentimental good sport. Sixteen years later, actor [[Roy Jenson]] played Sullivan in the 1958 episode, \"The Gambler and the Lady\", of the [[Television syndication|syndicated television]] [[anthology series]], ''[[Death Valley Days]]'', hosted by [[Stanley Andrews]]. In the story line, Sullivan in his tour of local communities across the country fights an exposition match against Buck Jarrico ([[Hal Baylor]]).
