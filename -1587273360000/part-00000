It is mainly organized for choosing a new [[head of state]] in case of sudden death, adopting a new constitution, or to settle national or regional issue such as war.<ref name=\"news.bbc.co.uk\">{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1782079.stm | work=BBC News | title=Q&A: What is a loya jirga? | date=July 1, 2002 | accessdate=May 11, 2010}}</ref> It predates modern-day written or fixed laws and is mostly favored by the [[Pashtun people]] but to a lesser extent by other nearby groups that have been influenced by Pashtuns (historically known as [[Afghan (ethnonym)|Afghans]]).\n\nIn [[Afghanistan]], ''loya jirgas'' have been reportedly organized since at least the early 18th century when the [[Durrani dynasty|Durrani]] rose to power.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/11/opinion/11krakauer.html?scp=8&sq=jon%20krakauer&st=cse |title=To Save Afghanistan, Look to Its Past |author=Jon Krakauer |newspaper=New York Times |date=September 11, 2009 |accessdate=2014-10-29}}</ref>\n\n==History and terminology ==\n\nThere is a myth in the sense that the ancient [[Aryan]] tribes, who are hypothesized to have spoken [[Proto-Indo-Iranian language|Proto-Indo-Iranian]], came down in intermittent waves from [[Central Asia]] and Afghanistan. They practiced a sort of ''jirga'' system with two types of councils \u2013 ''{{transl|pus|simite}}'' and ''{{transl|pus|sabh\u0101}}''. The ''{{transl|pus|simite}}'' (summit) comprised elders and tribal chiefs. The king also joined sessions of the ''{{transl|pus|simite}}''. ''Sabh\u0101'' was a sort of rural council. In India it is referred to as ''Samiti'' and ''Sabha''.\n\nIt was used over time for the selection of rulers and headmen and the airing of matters of principle. From the time of the great Kushan ruler [[Kanishka]] to the 1970s, there were sixteen [[nation]]al ''loya jirgas'' and hundreds of smaller ones. The institution, which is centuries old, is a similar idea to the Islamic ''[[shura]]'' (consultative assembly).<ref name=\"news.bbc.co.uk\"/>\n\nIn the [[Demographics of Afghanistan|Afghan society]], the ''loya jirga'' is still maintained and favored, mostly by tribal leaders to solve internal or external disputes with other tribes. In some cases it functions like a [[town hall meeting]].\n\nWhen the Afghans took power they tried to legitimize their hold with such a ''jirga''. While in the beginning only Pashtuns were allowed to participate in the ''jirgas'', later other ethnic groups like [[Tajik people|Tajiks]] and [[Hazara people|Hazaras]] were allowed to participate as well, however they were little more than observers. The member of the ''jirgas'' were mostly members of the Royal Family, religious leaders and tribal leaders of the Afghans. King [[Amanullah Khan]] institutionalized the ''jirga''. From Amanullah until the reign of [[Mohammed Zahir Shah]] (1933\u20131973) and [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]] (1973\u20131978) the ''jirga'' was recognized as a common meeting of regional Pashtun leaders.\n\nThe meetings do not have scheduled occurrences, but rather are called for when issues or disputes arise. There is no time limit for a ''loya jirga'' to conclude, and the meetings often take time because decisions can only be made as a group and arguments can drag out for days. Various issues can be addressed such as major disaster, foreign policy, declaration of war, the legitimacy of leaders, and the introduction of new ideas and laws.\n\n==Afghanistan==\nLoya Jirga is not a joke it is only for Afghanistan and Abdali can call the Jirga For Greater Afghanistan.\nSome of the historical ''loya jirgas'' in the [[history of Afghanistan]] are:\n*'''October 1747''' \u2013 A ''jirga'' at [[Kandahar]] was attended by Afghan representatives who appointed [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] as their new leader.\n*'''September 1928''' \u2013 A ''jirga'' at [[Paghman]], called by [[King Amanullah]], the third loya jirga of his reign (1919\u20131929) to discuss reforms.\n*'''September 1930''' \u2013 A ''jirga'' of 286 called by [[Mohammed Nadir Shah]] to confirm his accession to the throne.\n*'''1941''' \u2013 Called by [[Mohammed Zahir Shah]] to approve neutrality in [[World War II]].\n*'''1947''' \u2013 Held by Pashtuns in the [[FATA|Tribal Agencies]] to choose between joining [[India]] or [[Pakistan]].\n*'''July 26, 1949''' \u2013 [[Afghanistan-Pakistan relations]] rapidly deteriorated over a dispute, officially declared that it did not recognize the 1893 [[Durand Line]] border any longer between the two countries.<ref>Agha Amin, [http://www.chowk.com/ilogs/65724/47736 \"Resolving the Afghan-Pakistan Border Question\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012045458/http://www.chowk.com/ilogs/65724/47736 |date=October 12, 2008}}, ''Journal of Afghanistan Studies'', Kabul, (accessed December 12, 2009).</ref>\n*'''September 1964''' \u2013 A meeting of 452 called by [[Mohammed Zahir Shah]] to approve a new constitution.\n*'''July 1974''' \u2013 A meeting with Pakistan over the Durand Line.\n*'''[[1977 Afghan Constitutional Assembly election|January 1977]]''' \u2013 Approved the new constitution of [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]] establishing one-party rule in the [[Daouds Republic of Afghanistan|Republic of Afghanistan]].\n*'''September 2001''' \u2013 Four different loya jirga movements anticipating the end of [[Taliban]] rule.

It is mainly organized for choosing a new [[head of state]] in case of sudden death, adopting a new constitution, or to settle national or regional issue such as war.<ref name=\"news.bbc.co.uk\">{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1782079.stm | work=BBC News | title=Q&A: What is a loya jirga? | date=July 1, 2002 | accessdate=May 11, 2010}}</ref> It predates modern-day written or fixed laws and is mostly favored by the [[Pashtun people]] but to a lesser extent by other nearby groups that have been influenced by Pashtuns (historically known as [[Afghan (ethnonym)|Afghans]]).\n\nIn [[Afghanistan]], ''loya jirgas'' have been reportedly organized since at least the early 18th century when the [[Hotaki dynasty|Hotaki]] and [[Durrani dynasty|Durrani]] dynasties rose to power.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/11/opinion/11krakauer.html?scp=8&sq=jon%20krakauer&st=cse |title=To Save Afghanistan, Look to Its Past |author=Jon Krakauer |newspaper=New York Times |date=September 11, 2009 |accessdate=2014-10-29}}</ref>\n\n==History and terminology ==\n\nThere is a myth in the sense that the ancient [[Aryan]] tribes, who are hypothesized to have spoken [[Proto-Indo-Iranian language|Proto-Indo-Iranian]], came down in intermittent waves from [[Central Asia]] and Afghanistan. They practiced a sort of ''jirga'' system with two types of councils \u2013 ''{{transl|pus|simite}}'' and ''{{transl|pus|sabh\u0101}}''. The ''{{transl|pus|simite}}'' (summit) comprised elders and tribal chiefs. The king also joined sessions of the ''{{transl|pus|simite}}''. ''Sabh\u0101'' was a sort of rural council. In India it is referred to as ''Samiti'' and ''Sabha''.\n\nIt was used over time for the selection of rulers and headmen and the airing of matters of principle. From the time of the great Kushan ruler [[Kanishka]] to the 1970s, there were sixteen [[nation]]al ''loya jirgas'' and hundreds of smaller ones. The institution, which is centuries old, is a similar idea to the Islamic ''[[shura]]'' (consultative assembly).<ref name=\"news.bbc.co.uk\"/>\n\nIn the [[Demographics of Afghanistan|Afghan society]], the ''loya jirga'' is still maintained and favored, mostly by tribal leaders to solve internal or external disputes with other tribes. In some cases it functions like a [[town hall meeting]].\n\nWhen the Afghans took power they tried to legitimize their hold with such a ''jirga''. While in the beginning only Pashtuns were allowed to participate in the ''jirgas'', later other ethnic groups like [[Tajik people|Tajiks]] and [[Hazara people|Hazaras]] were allowed to participate as well, however they were little more than observers. The member of the ''jirgas'' were mostly members of the Royal Family, religious leaders and tribal leaders of the Afghans. King [[Amanullah Khan]] institutionalized the ''jirga''. From Amanullah until the reign of [[Mohammed Zahir Shah]] (1933\u20131973) and [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]] (1973\u20131978) the ''jirga'' was recognized as a common meeting of regional Pashtun leaders.\n\nThe meetings do not have scheduled occurrences, but rather are called for when issues or disputes arise. There is no time limit for a ''loya jirga'' to conclude, and the meetings often take time because decisions can only be made as a group and arguments can drag out for days. Various issues can be addressed such as major disaster, foreign policy, declaration of war, the legitimacy of leaders, and the introduction of new ideas and laws.\n\n==Afghanistan==\nSome of the historical ''loya jirgas'' in the [[history of Afghanistan]] are:\n*'''1707\u20131709''' \u2013 ''Loya jirga'' was gathered by [[Mir Wais Hotak]] at [[Kandahar]] in 1707, but according to [[Ghulam Mohammad Ghobar]] it was gathered in Manja in 1709.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wolas.beepworld.de/mirwaisneeka.htm |title=Mirwais Neeka |publisher=Wolas.beepworld.de |date= |accessdate=2013-04-15}}</ref>\n*'''October 1747''' \u2013 A ''jirga'' at [[Kandahar]] was attended by Afghan representatives who appointed [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] as their new leader.\n*'''September 1928''' \u2013 A ''jirga'' at [[Paghman]], called by [[King Amanullah]], the third loya jirga of his reign (1919\u20131929) to discuss reforms.\n*'''September 1930''' \u2013 A ''jirga'' of 286 called by [[Mohammed Nadir Shah]] to confirm his accession to the throne.\n*'''1941''' \u2013 Called by [[Mohammed Zahir Shah]] to approve neutrality in [[World War II]].\n*'''1947''' \u2013 Held by Pashtuns in the [[FATA|Tribal Agencies]] to choose between joining [[India]] or [[Pakistan]].\n*'''July 26, 1949''' \u2013 [[Afghanistan-Pakistan relations]] rapidly deteriorated over a dispute, officially declared that it did not recognize the 1893 [[Durand Line]] border any longer between the two countries.<ref>Agha Amin, [http://www.chowk.com/ilogs/65724/47736 \"Resolving the Afghan-Pakistan Border Question\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012045458/http://www.chowk.com/ilogs/65724/47736 |date=October 12, 2008}}, ''Journal of Afghanistan Studies'', Kabul, (accessed December 12, 2009).</ref>\n*'''September 1964''' \u2013 A meeting of 452 called by [[Mohammed Zahir Shah]] to approve a new constitution.\n*'''July 1974''' \u2013 A meeting with Pakistan over the Durand Line.\n*'''[[1977 Afghan Constitutional Assembly election|January 1977]]''' \u2013 Approved the new constitution of [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]] establishing one-party rule in the [[Daouds Republic of Afghanistan|Republic of Afghanistan]].\n*'''April 1985''' \u2013 To ratify the new constitution of the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]].\n*'''September 2001''' \u2013 Four different loya jirga movements anticipating the end of [[Taliban]] rule.
