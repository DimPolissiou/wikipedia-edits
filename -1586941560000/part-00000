This action was inspired by the [[United States of America|US]] [[Civil Rights]] [[Freedom Ride]] campaign in 1961. The Australian Freedom Ride aimed to expose discrepancies in living, education and health conditions among the Aboriginal population. The tour targeted rural towns such as [[Walgett]], [[Moree, New South Wales|Moree]], and [[Kempsey, New South Wales|Kempsey]]. They acted to publicise acts of blatant discrimination. This was demonstrated through one of the Freedom Ride activities in Walgett. A local [[Returned and Services League of Australia|RSL]] club refused entry to Aborigines, including those who were ex-servicemen who participated in the two [[World Wars]]. At one stage during the Rides, the protesters' bus was run off the road.\n\nOn 20 February 1965, Perkins and his party tried to enter the swimming pool at [[Moree, New South Wales|Moree]], where the [[Moree Plains Shire|local council]] had barred Aboriginal people from swimming since its opening 40 years earlier. They stood at the gate refusing to let anyone else in if they were not let in. In response to this action, the riders faced physical opposition from several hundred local white Australians, including community leaders, and were pelted with eggs and tomatoes. These events were broadcast across Australia, and under pressure from public opinion, the council eventually reversed the ban on Aboriginal swimmers. The Freedom Ride then moved on, but on the way out they were followed by a line of cars, one of which collided with the rear of their bus forcing them to return to Moree where they found that the council had reneged on their previous decision. The Freedom Riders protested once again, forcing the council to  remove the ban once more.<ref name=Cockerill>{{cite web\n  | last =Cockerill\n  | first =Michael\n  | title =Australian football loses a trail-blazer\n  | publisher =[[FIFA]]\n  | date =20 April 2001\n  | url =http://images.fifa.com/en/organisation/index/0,1521,24227,00.html?articleid=24227\n  | accessdate =20 January 2007\n  | url-status =dead\n  | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070312173606/http://images.fifa.com/en/organisation/index/0%2C1521%2C24227%2C00.html?articleid=24227\n  | archivedate =12 March 2007\n  | df =dmy-all\n  }}</ref>\n\nOn 6 August 1965, Charles Perkins staged a fake \"kidnapping\" of 5 year old Nancy Prasad from under the nose of immigration officials at the Sydney airport for the purpose of highlighting the injustice her deportation under Australia's \"White Australia\" immigration policy.<ref>{{ cite web|title=Immigration Nation: Part 3 | url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WNRb8Hypjo }}</ref><ref name=telegraph-nancyprasad>{{cite news| url = http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/deported-nancy-prasad-was-the-little-girl-who-helped-bring-down-the-white-australia-policy/news-story/001ee3eff23d0cef94d0961e2811396a|title=Deported: Nancy Prasad was the little girl who helped bring down the White Australia policy|author=Benns, Matthew|work=Daily Telegraph|date=7 August 2015|access-date=16 December 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{ cite book|title =Deported: A History of Forced Departures from Australia  | first1 =Glenn|last1=Nicholls| url=https://books.google.com/?id=dRQcNtT35AIC&pg=PA113&dq=nancy+prasad#v=onepage&q=nancy%20prasad&f=false | isbn =9780868409894| year =2007}}</ref>  His antic had effect.

In the lead up to the referendum Perkins was manager of the Foundation for Aboriginal Affairs, an organization that took a key role in advocating a Yes vote. The constitutional amendment passed with a 90.77% majority.\n\n===Public service===\nIn 1969 Perkins began his career in public service as a Senior Research Officer with the Office of Aboriginal Affairs. In 1972, as a public servant, he was suspended for alleged improper conduct after he called the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]]\u2013[[National Party of Australia|Country]] Coalition government in [[Western Australia]] 'racist and [[Redneck (stereotype)|redneck]]'.\n\nIn 1981, he was appointed Permanent Secretary of the [[Department of Aboriginal Affairs]], the first Aboriginal to become a permanent head of a federal government department. He served as Chairman of the Aboriginal Development Commission between 1981 and 1984. Throughout his career he was a strident critic of [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]] policies on indigenous affairs and was renowned for his fiery comments. [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Bob Hawke]] once said of Perkins that he \"sometimes found it difficult to observe the constraints usually imposed on permanent heads of departments because he had a burning passion for advancing the interests of his people\". Perkins served as Secretary until 1988. A year later he became Chairman of the [[Arrernte Council]] of Central Australia.\n\nIn 1993 Perkins was elected commissioner of the [[Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission]] for an area of the central Northern Territory. In 1994, he was elected Deputy Chairperson of ATSIC.\n\n===Public commentary===\nOn 7 April 2000, Perkins suggested that 'Sydney will burn during the [Sydney 2000] Olympics.'

This action was inspired by the [[United States of America|US]] [[Civil Rights]] [[Freedom Ride]] campaign in 1961. The Australian Freedom Ride aimed to expose discrepancies in living, education and health conditions among the Aboriginal population. The tour targeted rural towns such as [[Walgett]], [[Moree, New South Wales|Moree]], and [[Kempsey, New South Wales|Kempsey]]. They acted to publicise acts of blatant discrimination. This was demonstrated through one of the Freedom Ride activities in Walgett. A local [[Returned and Services League of Australia|RSL]] club refused entry to Aborigines, including those who were ex-servicemen who participated in the two [[World Wars]]. At one stage during the Rides, the protesters' bus was run off the road.\n\nOn 20 February 1965, Perkins and his party tried to enter the swimming pool at [[Moree, New South Wales|Moree]], where the [[Moree Plains Shire|local council]] had barred Aboriginal people from swimming since its opening 40 years earlier. They stood at the gate refusing to let anyone else in if they were not let in. In response to this action, the riders faced physical opposition from several hundred local white Australians, including community leaders, and were pelted with eggs and tomatoes. These events were broadcast across Australia, and under pressure from public opinion, the council eventually reversed the ban on Aboriginal swimmers. The Freedom Ride then moved on, but on the way out they were followed by a line of cars, one of which collided with the rear of their bus forcing them to return to Moree where they found that the council had reneged on their previous decision. The Freedom Riders protested once again, forcing the council to  remove the ban once more.<ref name=Cockerill>{{cite web\n  | last =Cockerill\n  | first =Michael\n  | title =Australian football loses a trail-blazer\n  | publisher =[[FIFA]]\n  | date =20 April 2001\n  | url =http://images.fifa.com/en/organisation/index/0,1521,24227,00.html?articleid=24227\n  | accessdate =20 January 2007\n  | url-status =dead\n  | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070312173606/http://images.fifa.com/en/organisation/index/0%2C1521%2C24227%2C00.html?articleid=24227\n  | archivedate =12 March 2007\n  | df =dmy-all\n  }}</ref>\n\nOn 6 August 1965, Charles Perkins staged a fake \"kidnapping\" of 5 year old Nancy Prasad from under the nose of immigration officials at the Sydney airport for the purpose of highlighting the injustice her deportation under Australia's \"White Australia\" immigration policy.<ref>{{ cite web|title=Immigration Nation: Part 3 | url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WNRb8Hypjo }}</ref><ref name=telegraph-nancyprasad>{{cite news| url = http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/deported-nancy-prasad-was-the-little-girl-who-helped-bring-down-the-white-australia-policy/news-story/001ee3eff23d0cef94d0961e2811396a|title=Deported: Nancy Prasad was the little girl who helped bring down the White Australia policy|author=Benns, Matthew|work=Daily Telegraph|date=7 August 2015|access-date=16 December 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{ cite book|title =Deported: A History of Forced Departures from Australia  | first1 =Glenn|last1=Nicholls| url=https://books.google.com/?id=dRQcNtT35AIC&pg=PA113&dq=nancy+prasad#v=onepage&q=nancy%20prasad&f=false | isbn =9780868409894| year =2007}}</ref>  His antic had effect.

The constitutional amendment passed with a 90.77% majority.\n\n===Public service===\nIn 1969 Perkins began his career in public service as a Senior Research Officer with the Office of Aboriginal Affairs.

He served as Chairman of the Aboriginal Development Commission between 1981 and 1984. Throughout his career he was a strident critic of [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]] policies on indigenous affairs and was renowned for his fiery comments. [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Bob Hawke]] once said of Perkins that he \"sometimes found it difficult to observe the constraints usually imposed on permanent heads of departments because he had a burning passion for advancing the interests of his people\". Perkins served as Secretary until 1988. A year later he became Chairman of the [[Arrernte Council]] of Central Australia.\n\nIn 1993 Perkins was elected commissioner of the [[Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission]] for an area of the central Northern Territory. In 1994, he was elected Deputy Chairperson of ATSIC.\n\n===Public commentary===\nOn 7 April 2000, Perkins suggested that 'Sydney will burn during the [Sydney 2000] Olympics.'

The film stars [[Rajat Kapoor]], [[Vinay Pathak]], [[Sarika]], [[Milind Soman]] and [[Ranvir Shorey]] in lead roles. It released on 13 April 2007, and received favourable reviews from critics. Though made on a small budget, the film managed to do very well at the box office. This film was based on the French movie 1998 ''[[Le D\u00eener de Cons (film)|Le D\u00eener de Cons]]'' which was later adapted into a 2010 Hollywood film ''[[Dinner for Schmucks]]''. It is the first installment of ''[[Bheja Fry (film series)|Bheja Fry trilogy]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nRanjeet Thadani ([[Rajat Kapoor]]) is a music producer married to Sheetal ([[Sarika]]) a singer. Ranjeet and his friends get together every Friday for a party. This is a different kind of party where they invite idiots to ridicule them behind the scenes and calling them \"talent\". They enjoy doing it so much that they don't even mind missing out on family appointments.\n\nOne of Ranjeet's friends meets Bharat Bhushan ([[Vinay Pathak]]), an inspector in the [[Income Tax Department]], on a trip to [[Pune]] and decides that he could probably be a source of entertainment for Ranjeet. Ranjeet promptly calls Bharat and invites him for dinner.\n\nBharat is a talkative self-promoting singer who carries with him a scrap book showcasing his musical life. He is excited at the prospect of meeting a [[music producer]] which might help advance his career as a singer. Bharat is kind-hearted and wants to help everyone but he also has the ability to mess things up for people around him. He can be annoying to the person who is sitting next to him but he makes it a funny experience for everyone else watching him.\n\nFriday arrives but Ranjeet's back is sprained badly and is restricted from moving around. Ranjeet knows that he will not be able to make it to the party but still decides to meet with Bharat to see how good or rather bad he is. Before Bharat arrives at Ranjeet's residence, Sheetal leaves after an altercation with Ranjeet. When Ranjeet asks Bharat to call his family doctor, he accidentally calls Ranjeet's girlfriend Suman Rao ([[Bhairavi Goswami]]). Ranjeet asks Bharat to leave his home for all the mess he has created. Ranjeet tries to get information regarding Sheetal's whereabout. Bharat offers to help and calls Sheetal's previous boyfriend Anant Ghoshal ([[Milind Soman]]) under a false identity. Instead, he ends up giving Ranjeet's Landline number that makes it obvious to Anant that Ranjeet is trying to get all details. Anant tells Ranjeet that Sheetal might have gone to Keval Arora, a sex-freak.\n\nIt turns out that a colleague of Bharat, Asif Merchant ([[Ranvir Shorey]]), who is also an inspector in the income tax department, knows the whereabouts of Keval. Asif is a snobby character who loves to watch cricket and is an ardent fan of Pakistan. While trying to mend the relationship between Ranjeet and Sheetal, Suman tells Bharat that he was called by Ranjeet to make a fool of him and have fun at his expense. This hurts Bharat, but the good-hearted Bharat still wants to help Ranjeet by letting Sheetal know how sorry Ranjeet is because of his acts and how much he loves her. However, he again messes up and the film ends on a funny note.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Rajat Kapoor]] as Ranjeet Thadani\n* [[Vinay Pathak]] as Bharat Bhushan\n* [[Sarika]] as Sheetal Agarwal\n* [[Ranvir Shorey]] as Asif Merchant\n* [[Milind Soman]] as Anant Ghoshal\n* [[Bhairavi Goswami]] as Suman Rao\n* [[Tom Alter]] as Doctor\n\n==Music==\n#Kaun Kiska Hua Hai Yaha - [[Vasundhara Das]]\n#Bacha Hai Na Koi Raha - [[Shaan (singer)|Shaan]]\n\n==Reception==\n{{Refimprove section|date=April 2016}}\nThe film received positive to average response from critics and public.

She quickly founded a company, Unotchit Inc., to develop, produce and distribute this technology. By 2011, Unotchit Inc. shifted its market focus into business and legal transactions and was producing a range of products, for a variety of remote writing applications, based on the LongPen technologies and renamed itself to Syngrafii Inc.

She quickly founded a company, Unotchit Inc., to develop, produce and distribute this technology. By 2011, Unotchit Inc. shifted its market focus into business and legal transactions and was producing a range of products, for a variety of remote writing applications, based on the LongPen technologies and renamed itself to Syngrafii Inc.
