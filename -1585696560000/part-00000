Its primary significance is in advocating for a combined arms approach to warfare using five types of infantry and two type of support. Qi Jiguang separated infantry into five separate categories: firearms, swordsmen, archers with fire arrows, ordinary archers, and spearmen. He split support crews into horse archers and artillery units. The ''Jixiao Xinshu'' is also one of the earliest existing East Asian texts to address the relevance of [[Chinese martial arts]] with respect to military training and warfare. Several contemporary martial arts styles of Qi's era are mentioned in the book, including the staff method of the [[Shaolin temple]].\n\n==Background==\n\nIn the late 16th century the military of the Ming dynasty was in poor condition. As the [[Mongol]] forces of [[Altan Khan]] raided the northern frontier, China's coastline fell prey to ''[[wokou]]'' pirates, who were ostensibly Japanese in origin. Qi Jiguang was assigned to the defense of [[Zhejiang]] in 1555, where he created his own standards of military organization, equipment, tactics, training, and procedures.<ref>{{harvnb|Huang|1981|p=159}}</ref> He published his thoughts on military techniques, tactics, and strategies in the ''Jixiao Xinshu'' after achieving several victories in battle.\n\n==Contents==\n\nThere are two editions of the ''Jixiao Xinshu''. The first edition was written from 1560-1561 and consists of 18 chapters. It is known as the 18 chapter edition. The second edition, published in 1584 during Qi's forced retirement, included re-edited and new material compiled in 14 chapters. It is known as the 14 chapter edition.\n\nThe chapters included in the 18-chapter edition are as follows:<ref>{{harvnb|Gyves|1993|pp=16\u201318}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-  \n! Chapter !! Subject\n|-\n| 1. || Five man squads\n|-\n| 2. || Signals and commands\n|-\n| 3. || Motivating troops\n|-\n| 4. || Issuing orders; prohibitions during combat\n|-\n| 5. || Training officers\n|-\n| 6. || Evaluating soldiers; rewards and punishments\n|-\n| 7. and 8. || Field camp activities; in-camp drilling with flags and drums\n|-\n| 9. || The march\n|-\n| 10. || Use of polearms\n|-\n| 11. || Use of the shield\n|-\n| 12. || Use of swords\n|-\n| 13. || Archery\n|-\n| 14. || ''Quanjing Jieyao Pian'' (Chapter on the Fist Canon and the Essentials of Nimbleness); unarmed fighting\n|-\n| 15. || Devices and formations for defending city walls\n|-\n| 16. || Illustrations of standards, banners, and signal drums\n|-\n| 17. || Guarding outposts\n|-\n| 18. || Coastal warfare\n|-\n|}\n\n==Mandarin duck formation==\n\nIn the ''Jixiao Xinshu'', Qi Jiguang recommended a 12-man team known as the \"mandarin duck formation\" ({{zh|c=\u9d1b\u9d26\u9663|p=yu\u0101ny\u0101ng zh\u00e8n}}), which consisted of 11 soldiers and one person for logistics.<ref>{{harvnb|Huang|1981|p=168}}</ref>\n\n*4 men with long lances (twelve feet or longer) (''chang qiang shou'' \u9577\u69cd\u624b)\n*2 men with sabers and [[rattan shield]]s, one on each side of the lancers (''dun pai shou'' \u76fe\u724c\u624b)\n*2 men with [[langxian|multiple tip spears]] (''lang xian shou'' \u72fc\u7b45\u624b)\n*2 men with tridents or swords (''duan bing shou'' \u77ed\u5175\u624b)\n*1 corporal (with the squad flag) (''dui zhang'' \u968a\u9577)\n*1 cook/porter (logistical personnel) (''fuze huoshi de huobing'' \u8ca0\u8cac\u5925\u98df\u7684\u706b\u5175)\n\nThe mandarin duck formation was ideally symmetrical. Excluding the corporal and cook/porter, the ten remaining men could be split into two identical five-man squads. This was so that when Japanese pirates made it past the long lances, the saber-and-shield men formed a protective screen for the vulnerable lancers. In battle, the two saber-and-shield men had different roles. The one on the right would hold the advance position of the squad, while the one on the left was to throw javelins and lure the enemy closer. The two men with multiple tip spears would entangle the pirates while the lancers attacked them. The trident carriers guarded the flanks and rear.<ref>{{harvnb|Huang|1981|pp=168\u2013169}}</ref>\n\n===Firearms===\nAfter suffering several defeats to pirates, Qi also made a recommendation for a concerted campaign to integrate musket teams into the army, based on their superior range and firepower compared to bows and arrows.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=172}} Qi became enamored with the musket after his defeats and became one of the primary proponents of their use in the Ming army. He favored it for its accuracy and its ability to penetrate armor.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=172}}\n\nIdeally an entire musket team would have 10 musketeers, but often had 4 or 2 in practice. The optimal musket formation that Qi proposed was a 12 man musket team similar to the melee mandarin duck formation. However, instead of fighting in a hand to hand formation, they operated on the principle of [[volley fire]], which Qi pioneered prior to the publication of the first edition of the ''Jixiao Xinshu''.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=172}} The teams could be arranged in a single line, formed two layers deep with five musketeers each, or five layers deep with two muskets per layer. Once the enemy was within range, each layer would fire in succession, and afterwards a unit armed with traditional close combat weapons would move forward ahead of the musketeers. The troops would then enter into melee combat with the enemy together. Alternatively, the musketeers could be placed behind wooden stockades or other fortifications, firing and reloading continuously by turns.{{sfn|Andrade|2016|p=174}}\n\nEach squad was drilled in coordinated and mutually-supportive combat scenarios with clearly defined roles. Because Qi's troops were recruited from peasant stock, and were not considered the equals of their Japanese foes, Qi Jiguang emphasized the use of combined arms and squad tactics. Units were rewarded or punished collectively: an officer was executed if his entire unit fled the enemy, and if a squad leader was killed in battle, the whole squad would be put to death.<ref>{{harvnb|Huang|1981|pp=167\u2013169}}</ref>\n\n==Weapons production==\n\nThe standard procedure for the procurement of weapons for a commander such as Qi Jiguang was for production quotas to be assigned by provincial officials to each local district under the commander's responsibility. The resulting weapons produced under this system varied widely in quality. Muskets in particular exploded with alarming frequency, leading Qi to eschew reliance on firearms in favor of using melee tools such as swords, rattan shields, and sharpened bamboo poles.<ref>{{harvnb|Huang|1981|pp=170\u2013171}}</ref> However, later in his career Qi became a strong proponent of integrating muskets after suffering several defeats to the pirates. Qi's reconsideration of firearms in warfare led to the creation of the first well drilled musket teams in China. Qi was also a pioneer of the musket volley fire technique, which would later be adopted throughout China and Korea. Included in the manual are several passages detailing the usage of muskets, the volley fire technique, and an estimation of the percentage of firearms that would likely fail to fire.<ref>{{harvnb|Huang|1981|p=172}}</ref>\n\nThe manual provides the following description of the forging of swords:\n\n{{cquote|\nThe following steps in the manufacturing process of the short sword are necessary:\n# The material of iron used must be forged many times (that is heated, hammered and folded numerous times).\n# The cutting edge must be made from the best steel, free of impurities.\n# The entire part of the blade where the back or ridge of the blade joins the cutting edge must be filed so that they appear seamlessly joined together. This process is necessary to enable the sword to cut well.}}\n\n==Unarmed fighting==\nThe last chapter of the ''Jixiao Xinshu'', the ''Quanjing Jieyao Pian'', covers the subject of unarmed combat. Qi Jiguang regarded unarmed fighting as being useless on the battlefield. However, he recognized its value as a form of basic training to strengthen his troops, improving their physical fitness and confidence.<ref>{{harvnb|Gyves|1993|p=33}}</ref> Qi selected thirty-two postures to illustrate, from among the martial arts of the period. The description of the techniques is written in verse, typically with seven characters per line.\n\nIn the chapter's introduction, Qi names sixteen different fighting styles, all of which he considered to have been handed down in an incomplete fashion, \"some missing the lower part, some missing the upper\".<ref>{{harvnb|Gyves|1993|pp=34\u201335}}</ref> Among the arts listed is the [[Shaolin kung fu|Shaolin staff method]], which was later documented in detail in [[Cheng Zongyou]]'s ''Exposition of the Original Shaolin Staff Method'', published around 1610.<ref>{{harvnb|Shahar|2008|pp=56\u201357}}</ref> By contrast, Shaolin unarmed fighting techniques are not mentioned. The entire listing of late Ming dynasty martial arts was later copied without attribution by a manual of the Shaolin style, the ''Hand Combat Classic'' (''Quanjing quanfa beiyao''). However, the later manual, with a preface dated to 1784, altered the text, adding a spurious claim that the history of hand combat had originated at the Shaolin Monastery.<ref>{{harvnb|Shahar|2008|pp=116\u2013117}}</ref>\n\nQi's discussion of hand-to-hand combat makes no mention of a spiritual element to the martial arts, nor does it allude to breathing or [[qi]] circulation. By contrast, Chinese martial arts texts from the [[Manchu conquest of China|Ming-Qing transition]] onward represent a synthesis of functional martial arts techniques with [[Taoist|Daoist]] ''[[tao yin|daoyin]]'' health practices, breathing exercises, and meditation.<ref>{{harvnb|Shahar|2008|pp=148\u2013149}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Lorge|2011|p=202}}</ref>\n\n==Influence==\nQi Jiguang was one of several Ming authors to document the military tactics and martial arts techniques of the era. The earliest known documentation of specific styles of [[Chinese martial arts]] were produced during the late Ming piracy crisis, as scholars and generals such as Qi and his contemporary [[Yu Dayou]] turned their attention to reversing the decline of the Ming military. In the late 16th century, the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592\u201398)]] also spurred great interest in military training methods within the Korean government. Qi Jiguang's writings were of particular interest because of his successful campaigns against Japanese pirates several decades prior. The 14-chapter edition of the ''Jixiao Xinshu'' served as a model for the oldest known extant Korean military manual, the [[Muyejebo]], and was disseminated among Korean military thinkers.\n\nIn Japan both the 14 and 18 chapter editions were published several times, and some methods from the ''Jixiao Xinshu'' were transferred over to the ''Heiho Hidensho'' (Okugisho), a Japanese strategy book written by [[Yamamoto Kansuke (general)|Yamamoto Kansuke]] in the 16th century.\n\n==Gallery==\n\n<gallery widths=\"180\" heights=\"180\">\nFile:Mandarin Duck Formation layout.png|Layout of the 'mandarin duck formation.'\nFile:Second Power Formation.png|The 'second power formation' is a split 'mandarin duck squad.'\nFile:Lesser Third Power Formation.png|The 'lesser third power formation.'\nFile:Third Power Formation.png|The 'third power formation.'\nFile:Marching column.png|A marching column contained sixteen 'mandarin duck formations' divided into four platoons.

Included in the manual are several passages detailing the usage of muskets, the volley fire technique, and an estimation of the percentage of firearms that would likely fail to fire.<ref>{{harvnb|Huang|1981|p=172}}</ref>\n\nThe manual provides the following description of the forging of swords:\n\n{{cquote|\nThe following steps in the manufacturing process of the short sword are necessary:\n# The material of iron used must be forged many times (that is heated, hammered and folded numerous times).\n# The cutting edge must be made from the best steel, free of impurities.\n# The entire part of the blade where the back or ridge of the blade joins the cutting edge must be filed so that they appear seamlessly joined together. This process is necessary to enable the sword to cut well.}}\n\n==Unarmed fighting==\nThe last chapter of the ''Jixiao Xinshu'', the ''Quanjing Jieyao Pian'', covers the subject of unarmed combat. Qi Jiguang regarded unarmed fighting as being useless on the battlefield. However, he recognized its value as a form of basic training to strengthen his troops, improving their physical fitness and confidence.<ref>{{harvnb|Gyves|1993|p=33}}</ref> Qi selected thirty-two postures to illustrate, from among the martial arts of the period. The description of the techniques is written in verse, typically with seven characters per line.\n\nIn the chapter's introduction, Qi names sixteen different fighting styles, all of which he considered to have been handed down in an incomplete fashion, \"some missing the lower part, some missing the upper\".<ref>{{harvnb|Gyves|1993|pp=34\u201335}}</ref> Among the arts listed is the [[Shaolin kung fu|Shaolin staff method]], which was later documented in detail in [[Cheng Zongyou]]'s ''Exposition of the Original Shaolin Staff Method'', published around 1610.<ref>{{harvnb|Shahar|2008|pp=56\u201357}}</ref> By contrast, Shaolin unarmed fighting techniques are not mentioned. The entire listing of late Ming dynasty martial arts was later copied without attribution by a manual of the Shaolin style, the ''Hand Combat Classic'' (''Quanjing quanfa beiyao''). However, the later manual, with a preface dated to 1784, altered the text, adding a spurious claim that the history of hand combat had originated at the Shaolin Monastery.<ref>{{harvnb|Shahar|2008|pp=116\u2013117}}</ref>\n\nQi's discussion of hand-to-hand combat makes no mention of a spiritual element to the martial arts, nor does it allude to breathing or [[qi]] circulation. By contrast, Chinese martial arts texts from the [[Manchu conquest of China|Ming-Qing transition]] onward represent a synthesis of functional martial arts techniques with [[Taoist|Daoist]] ''[[tao yin|daoyin]]'' health practices, breathing exercises, and meditation.<ref>{{harvnb|Shahar|2008|pp=148\u2013149}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Lorge|2011|p=202}}</ref>\n\n==Influence==\nQi Jiguang was one of several Ming authors to document the military tactics and martial arts techniques of the era. The earliest known documentation of specific styles of [[Chinese martial arts]] were produced during the late Ming piracy crisis, as scholars and generals such as Qi and his contemporary [[Yu Dayou]] turned their attention to reversing the decline of the Ming military. In the late 16th century, the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592\u201398)]] also spurred great interest in military training methods within the Korean government. Qi Jiguang's writings were of particular interest because of his successful campaigns against Japanese pirates several decades prior. The 14-chapter edition of the ''Jixiao Xinshu'' served as a model for the oldest known extant Korean military manual, the [[Muyejebo]], and was disseminated among Korean military thinkers.\n\nIn Japan both the 14 and 18 chapter editions were published several times, and some methods from the ''Jixiao Xinshu'' were transferred over to the ''Heiho Hidensho'' (Okugisho), a Japanese strategy book written by [[Yamamoto Kansuke (general)|Yamamoto Kansuke]] in the 16th century.\n\n==Gallery==\n\n<gallery widths=\"180\" heights=\"180\">\nFile:Mandarin Duck Formation layout.png|Layout of the 'mandarin duck formation.'\nFile:Second Power Formation.png|The 'second power formation' is a split 'mandarin duck squad.'\nFile:Lesser Third Power Formation.png|The 'lesser third power formation.'\nFile:Third Power Formation.png|The 'third power formation.'\nFile:Marching column.png|A marching column contained sixteen 'mandarin duck formations' divided into four platoons.

RSC's first competitive game was a 2\u20131 victory against Zora Sofia on 3 October 1929. In the 1939\u201340 season, RSC won the [[Bulgarian National Football Division 1939-40|Bulgarian]] title for first time in the team's history. The team was made by: Stoyo Nedyalkov (captain), Sl. Videnov, K. Kostov, D. Marinov, St. Angelov, As. Milushev, Krum Milev, L. Hranov. In 1945, the club had already been renamed Lokomotiv Sofia and won the [[Bulgarian Republic Football Championship 1945|title]] in the first post-war championship. During season 1963\u201364 after 30 games, Lokomotiv won their third title after they defeated main rivals to the title [[PFC Levski Sofia|Levski Sofia]] and [[PFC Slavia Sofia|Slavia Sofia]]. In 1969 the club was united with [[PFC Slavia Sofia|Slavia Sofia]] for a brief period to [[1971 in football (soccer)|1971]] and is associated with the Bulgarian railway workers. In 1978, led by [[Atanas Mihaylov]] and Boycho Velichkov Lokomotiv won their fourth title. In Europe the club won '''European championship of the railwaymen''' two times in 1961 and 1963, and [[Balkans Cup]] in 1973. In 1980 Lokomotiv reached a quarter final in the [[UEFA Cup]] where they faced [[VfB Stuttgart]], eliminating before that [[Ferencv\u00e1rosi TC|Ferencv\u00e1ros]], [[AS Monaco FC|AS Monaco]] and [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]]. Against Stuttgart the team lost with 0\u20131 in Sofia and with 1\u20133 in Germany.\n\n===1994\u20132015, Nikolay Gigov era===\nThe new era for Lokomotiv Sofia came in 1994 with the new president Nikolay Gigov. The football club's status was turned professional. For merely one year (1994\u201395), from a team struggling not to lose its place in the professional league, Lokomotiv won the silver medals in the Championship and the State Cup. The club's home ground is Lokomotiv Stadium with 25,000 places, a junior training center: Lokomotiv has an enthusiastic and well-organized fan-club. The team came fourth in the 2005\u201306 season in [[A PFG]] and qualified for the [[UEFA Cup 2006-07]] first qualifying round, where they face [[FK Makedonija Gjor\u010de Petrov]] from the [[Republic of Macedonia]]. Lokomotiv beat the Macedonian side 2\u20130 in the first match in Sofia on 13 July 2006 and finished 1\u20131 as a guest in Macedonia and continued to the next round of the tournament. Next, they faced the team of [[Bnei Yehuda Tel Aviv F.C.|Bnei Yehuda Tel Aviv]], which they beat twice: 2\u20130 on 10 August 2006 and 4\u20130 on 24 August 2006. Their next opponent in the first round of the tournament was the team of [[Feyenoord|Feyenoord Rotterdam]]. The first game in Sofia ended with a 2\u20132 draw, after Lokomotiv went ahead 2\u20130 early in the first half. The second game finished 0\u20130 and Lokomotiv Sofia were out of the UEFA tournament.\n\nDomestically, Lokomotiv had an amazing run of 10 consecutive wins, before being stopped by [[PFC CSKA Sofia|CSKA Sofia]] in the direct clash for the second position. Eventually, Lokomotiv finished third with equal points with second-placed [[PFC CSKA Sofia|CSKA Sofia]].\n\nThe 2007\u201308 season started promisingly for the team. In the UEFA Cup second qualifying round Lokomotiv eliminated Romanian side [[FC O\u021belul Gala\u021bi|O\u0163elul Gala\u0163i]] after a 3\u20131 win at home and a scoreless away draw. This marked 8 European games without a loss, which was a new national record for longest streak without a loss achieved by a Bulgarian team in all European competitions. The previous record of 7 games was held by [[PFC Levski Sofia|Levski Sofia]]. In the next round, Lokomotiv faced the French [[Stade Rennais F.C.|Rennes]] and the loss 1\u20133 in the first leg in Sofia marked an end to the team's winning streak in Europe. The Bulgarian side showed a surprising rally in the second game in France, which they won 2\u20131 and were only a single goal short of making it to the extra time. For a second consecutive year, Lokomotiv were stopped short of entering the group stage of the [[UEFA Cup]], despite being the first Bulgarian club in soccer history to snatch a victory on French soil. The team finished third during the [[2014\u201315 A Group|2014\u201315 season]] in the [[A PFG]], but was denied a license for the European tournaments and A Group due to unpaid debts. Lokomotiv were relegated to Bulgaria's third division, the [[Bulgarian South-West V AFG|V Group]].<ref>http://www.novinite.com/articles/169558/Draw+Confirms+Exclusion+of+CSKA,+Lokomotiv+Sofia+from+Bulgaria's+A+Group</ref>\n\n===FC Lokomotiv 1929===\nAfter the dissolving [[PFC Lokomotiv Sofia|Lokomotiv Sofia]], some of the legends of the team including Ivan Vasilev, Boycho Velichkov and Anton Velkov formed a new club in A OFG Sofia (city) - north (4th division). The youth academy is moved to the new club.

The 2017-18 season was very dramatical for Lokomotiv Sofia. They finished second in the Second League, which meant that they qualified for the promotion playoffs to enter First League. However, they were denied entry to the top tier by [[FC Vitosha Bistritsa]], who beat them on penalties to stay in the league.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.no/ |title=sport.com/news2044271_1.html

RSC's first competitive game was a 2\u20131 victory against Zora Sofia on 3 October 1929. In the 1939\u201340 season, RSC won the [[Bulgarian National Football Division 1939-40|Bulgarian]] title for first time in the team's history. The team was made by: Stoyo Nedyalkov (captain), Sl. Videnov, K. Kostov, D. Marinov, St. Angelov, As. Milushev, Krum Milev, L. Hranov. In 1945, the club had already been renamed Lokomotiv Sofia and won the [[Bulgarian Republic Football Championship 1945|title]] in the first post-war championship. During season 1963\u201364 after 30 games, Lokomotiv won their third title after they defeated main rivals to the title [[PFC Levski Sofia|Levski Sofia]] and [[PFC Slavia Sofia|Slavia Sofia]]. In 1969 the club was united with [[PFC Slavia Sofia|Slavia Sofia]] for a brief period to [[1971 in football (soccer)|1971]] and is associated with the Bulgarian railway workers. In 1978, led by [[Atanas Mihaylov]] and Boycho Velichkov Lokomotiv won their fourth title. In Europe the club won '''European championship of the railwaymen''' two times in 1961 and 1963, and [[Balkans Cup]] in 1973. In 1980 Lokomotiv reached a quarter final in the [[UEFA Cup]] where they faced [[VfB Stuttgart]], eliminating before that [[Ferencv\u00e1rosi TC|Ferencv\u00e1ros]], [[AS Monaco FC|AS Monaco]] and [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]]. Against Stuttgart the team lost with 0\u20131 in Sofia and with 1\u20133 in Germany.\n\n===1994\u20132015, Nikolay Gigov era===\nThe new era for Lokomotiv Sofia came in 1994 with the new president Nikolay Gigov. The football club's status was turned professional. For merely one year (1994\u201395), from a team struggling not to lose its place in the professional league, Lokomotiv won the silver medals in the Championship and the State Cup. The club's home ground is Lokomotiv Stadium with 25,000 places, a junior training center: Lokomotiv has an enthusiastic and well-organized fan-club. The team came fourth in the 2005\u201306 season in [[A PFG]] and qualified for the [[UEFA Cup 2006-07]] first qualifying round, where they face [[FK Makedonija Gjor\u010de Petrov]] from the [[Republic of Macedonia]]. Lokomotiv beat the Macedonian side 2\u20130 in the first match in Sofia on 13 July 2006 and finished 1\u20131 as a guest in Macedonia and continued to the next round of the tournament. Next, they faced the team of [[Bnei Yehuda Tel Aviv F.C.|Bnei Yehuda Tel Aviv]], which they beat twice: 2\u20130 on 10 August 2006 and 4\u20130 on 24 August 2006. Their next opponent in the first round of the tournament was the team of [[Feyenoord|Feyenoord Rotterdam]]. The first game in Sofia ended with a 2\u20132 draw, after Lokomotiv went ahead 2\u20130 early in the first half. The second game finished 0\u20130 and Lokomotiv Sofia were out of the UEFA tournament.\n\nDomestically, Lokomotiv had an amazing run of 10 consecutive wins, before being stopped by [[PFC CSKA Sofia|CSKA Sofia]] in the direct clash for the second position. Eventually, Lokomotiv finished third with equal points with second-placed [[PFC CSKA Sofia|CSKA Sofia]].\n\nThe 2007\u201308 season started promisingly for the team. In the UEFA Cup second qualifying round Lokomotiv eliminated Romanian side [[FC O\u021belul Gala\u021bi|O\u0163elul Gala\u0163i]] after a 3\u20131 win at home and a scoreless away draw. This marked 8 European games without a loss, which was a new national record for longest streak without a loss achieved by a Bulgarian team in all European competitions. The previous record of 7 games was held by [[PFC Levski Sofia|Levski Sofia]]. In the next round, Lokomotiv faced the French [[Stade Rennais F.C.|Rennes]] and the loss 1\u20133 in the first leg in Sofia marked an end to the team's winning streak in Europe. The Bulgarian side showed a surprising rally in the second game in France, which they won 2\u20131 and were only a single goal short of making it to the extra time. For a second consecutive year, Lokomotiv were stopped short of entering the group stage of the [[UEFA Cup]], despite being the first Bulgarian club in soccer history to snatch a victory on French soil. The team finished third during the [[2014\u201315 A Group|2014\u201315 season]] in the [[A PFG]], but was denied a license for the European tournaments and A Group due to unpaid debts. Lokomotiv were relegated to Bulgaria's third division, the [[Bulgarian South-West V AFG|V Group]].<ref>http://www.novinite.com/articles/169558/Draw+Confirms+Exclusion+of+CSKA,+Lokomotiv+Sofia+from+Bulgaria's+A+Group</ref>\n\n===FC Lokomotiv 1929===\nAfter the dissolving [[PFC Lokomotiv Sofia|Lokomotiv Sofia]], some of the legends of the team including Ivan Vasilev, Boycho Velichkov and Anton Velkov formed a new club in A OFG Sofia (city) - north (4th division).

After that there was a gap of long four years in the WDM3A production line in [[Diesel Locomotive Works|DLW]]. These new locomotives had their control stand shifted to the left side of the cabin. Meanwhile, Diesel Loco Modernisation Works (erstwhile Diesel Modification Works which again was known as Diesel Component Works) in Patiala started rebuilding the existing [[Indian locomotive class WDM-2|WDM2]] locomotives, which had reached midlife, with upgraded powerpacks. DLMW Patiala re-calibrates the powerpack and upgrades the output power rating to 3100HP.<ref>{{cite web| publisher=Indian Railways| url=http://www.dmw.indianrailways.gov.in/works/uploads/File/Company%20Profile.pdf| accessdate=March 2, 2018}}</ref> DLW again started building WDM3A from the year 2000 and continued till the end of 2002 with locomotive road numbers in the range 14058-14143. All the locomotives rebuilt by DLMW and later batch from DLW had regular WDM2 type square short hood profile and control stand position. DLW again built WDM3A variant locomotives, during 2005-2006, in the road number range 14144-14167 which were classified as [[WDM3B]] due to their difference in bogie design from classic ALCo asymmetrical trimount to HAHS design which was employed in WDG2 and later WDM3D classes too. Most of the WDM3B were later converted to WDM3D. In 2011, DLMW rebuilt locomotive number 16502 as WDM3A and equipped it with an Electronic Fuel Injection (EFI) system jointly developed by Engine Research Laboratory of IIT Kanpur, Engine Development Directorate of RDSO, and DLMW Patiala.<ref>{{cite web |publisher= Indian Railways |website= iitk.ac.in |title= Direction Article Development of EFI for 204-stroke locomotive diesel engine |url= https://www.iitk.ac.in/erl/Index_files/Popular%20Publication/Direction%20Article%20Development%20of%20EFI%20for%204-stroke%20locomotive%20diesel%20engine.pdf |date= 2018 |accessdate= March 2, 2018}}</ref>  DLMW continues to rebuild WDM2 as WDM3A and recently they have started rebuilding the DLW built WDM3A too when they reach their midlife.

After that there was a gap of long four years in the WDM3A production line in [[Diesel Locomotive Works|DLW]]. These new locomotives had their control stand shifted to the left side of the cabin. Meanwhile, Diesel Loco Modernisation Works (erstwhile Diesel Modification Works which again was known as Diesel Component Works) in Patiala started rebuilding the existing [[Indian locomotive class WDM-2|WDM2]] locomotives, which had reached midlife, with upgraded powerpacks.

DLW again built WDM3A variant locomotives, during 2005-2006, in the road number range 14144-14167 which were classified as [[WDM3B]] due to their difference in bogie design from classic ALCo asymmetrical trimount to HAHS design which was employed in WDG2 and later WDM3D classes too. Most of the WDM3B were later converted to WDM3D. In 2011, DLMW rebuilt locomotive number 16502 as WDM3A and equipped it with an Elctronic Fuel Injection (EFI) system jointly developed by Engine Research Laboratory of IIT Kanpur, Engine Development Directorate of RDSO, and DLMW Patiala.<ref>{{cite web |publisher= Indian Railways |website= iitk.ac.in |title= Direction Article Development of EFI for 204-stroke locomotive diesel engine |url= https://www.iitk.ac.in/erl/Index_files/Popular%20Publication/Direction%20Article%20Development%20of%20EFI%20for%204-stroke%20locomotive%20diesel%20engine.pdf |date= 2018 |accessdate= March 2, 2018}}</ref>  DLMW continues to rebuild WDM2 as WDM3A and recently they have started rebuilding the DLW built WDM3A too when they reach their midlife.

The exact mechanism of the primary disease is unknown, but the fundamental mechanism of all vasculitides is [[autoimmunity]]. Other possible secondary causes of cerebral vasculitis are [[infection]]s, systemic auto-immune diseases such as [[systemic lupus erythematosus]] (SLE) and [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[medication]]s and [[Recreational drug use|drugs]] ([[amphetamine]], [[cocaine]] and [[heroin]]), some forms of [[cancer]] ([[lymphoma]]s, [[leukemia]] and [[lung cancer]]) and other forms of systemic vasculitis such as [[granulomatosis with polyangiitis]], [[polyarteritis nodosa]] or [[Beh\u00e7et's disease]]. It may imitate, and is in turn imitated by, a number of other diseases that affect the blood vessels of the brain diffusely such as [[fibromuscular dysplasia]] and [[thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura]].<ref name=\"Rehman\" />\nThe disease may get initiated by inhaling roach spray like PIF-PAF containing ingredients such as pyrethroids, permethrin etc.\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[Cerebral angiography]] and [[magnetic resonance imaging]], family medical history, symptoms, a complete physical examination, and ultimately [[biopsy]] of the brain, are often required for the diagnosis.
