The second modern role-playing game published, it was written by Ken St. Andre to be a more accessible alternative to ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZExaEP-g_A |title=A Chat with Ken St Andre Part 1  |publisher=LordStrange YouTube.com |date= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYlRHXRjsFg |title=A Chat with Ken St Andre Part 2  |publisher=LordStrange YouTube.com |date= |accessdate=}}</ref> and is suitable for solitaire, group, and play-by-mail gameplay.\n\n==History==\nKen St. Andre, a public librarian in Phoenix, Arizona, liked the idea of fantasy role-playing after reading a friend's ''D&D'' rule books but found the actual rules confusing, so he wrote his own. \"I just wanted something I could play with my friends at a reasonable price, with reasonable equipment,\u201d he said.<ref name=dragon /> The first edition of ''Tunnels & Trolls'' was self-published in April 1975.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.garenewing.co.uk/tnt/interview.html| year = 1986| title = The Ken St Andre/Demon Issue Interview}}</ref> In June 1975, publisher Flying Buffalo Inc. released a second edition of the game, and Tunnels & Trolls quickly became D&D's biggest competitor.<ref name=ODaM>{{cite book | first=David M. | last=Ewalt | authorlink= David M.

This edition was also translated and published abroad in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]],<ref>In Germany ''Tunnels & Trolls'' was released as ''Schwerter & D\u00e4monen'' in September 1983, two months earlier than ''Dungeons & Dragons'', it was the very first roleplaying game available in German.<br/>{{cite book|last = Evers|first = Momo|title=Magische Zeiten|edition=1st|date=January 2005|publisher=[[Fantasy Productions]]|language=German|isbn=3-89064-516-X}}<br/>{{cite book|last=[[Ken St. Andre]] |first=Rick Loomis|title=Schwerter & D\u00e4monen|edition=1st|date=September 1983|publisher=[[Fantasy Productions]]|language=German|isbn=3-89064-000-1}}</ref> [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Finland]], [[Japan]], and it entered these markets before ''Dungeons & Dragons'' did in most cases.\n\nIn 1999 ''[[Pyramid (magazine)|Pyramid]]'' magazine named ''Tunnels & Trolls'' as one of ''The Millennium's Most Underrated Games''.  Editor [[Scott Haring]] said of the game \"everybody knows this was the second ever fantasy roleplaying game ... But to dismiss it as just an opportunistic ripoff would be grossly unfair. Flying Buffalo's ''T&T'' had its own zany feel \u2013 it was much less serious than ''D&D'' \u2013 and a less-complicated game system.\"<ref>{{cite journal| title=Second Sight: The Millennium's Most Influential Company and The Millennium's Most Underrated Game|journal=[[Pyramid (magazine)|Pyramid]] (online)|last=Haring| first=Scott D. |authorlink=Scott Haring | url= http://www.sjgames.com/pyramid/login/article.html?id=1240| date=1999-11-25| accessdate=2008-02-17}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, [[Flying Buffalo]] updated the 5th edition rules with a \"5.5\" publication that added about 40 pages of extra material. That same year, [[Fiery Dragon Productions]] produced a ''30th Anniversary Edition'' under license in a tin box complete with CD, map, and monster counters, and two new versions of the rules. Ken St. Andre used the opportunity to extensively update the style of play and introduce new role-playing concepts, such as character level determined by character attribute statistics instead of arbitrary numbers of experience points. The ''30th Anniversary'' rules are generally known as the 7th edition. One of the most significant innovations of 7th edition is the introduction of a skills system. The 7.5 edition was released in 2008 by Fiery Dragon, being an update and clarification on the 30th Anniversary Edition.\n\nIn 2012, Tunnels & Trolls was re-introduced in French-speaking markets by [[Grimtooth]] under license by Flying Buffalo. The French rulebook, which is officially the 8th edition, is based on the 7th edition, but includes elements taken from the 5.5 edition as well as clarifications by Ken St. Andre. The interior artwork includes the illustrations of the 5th edition, plus new inks by [[Liz Danforth]]. Several other products (solos and GM adventures) have already been released via Lulu.com and others have been announced.\n\nThe production work for the 8th edition prompted Flying Buffalo to start working on a Deluxe (9th) Edition of the rulebook.<ref>[http://trollhalla.com/outer-sanctum/2012/07/31/announcing-tunnels-and-trolls-deluxe/ Ken St.Andre Announcing Tunnels and Trolls Deluxe] [http://www.trollishdelver.com/2012/03/deluxe-edition-of-tunnels-trolls.html?showComment=1331512511480&m=0#c5423708491776565668 Explanations on the context of the Deluxe edition project] by [[Liz Danforth]] and [[Steve Crompton]]</ref> As Rick Loomis, head of Flying Buffalo Inc., put it, \"The French edition came out so beautiful that now that I have run out of 5.5, I am not satisfied to just reprint 5.5. I wanted to have a deluxe edition even better than the French one. (Competition is what drives us to be better!)\".  ''Deluxe Tunnels & Trolls'', written by St. Andre with additional design input and editing from longtime players [[Liz Danforth]] and James \"Bear\" Peters, was published in August 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deluxetunnelsandtrolls.wordpress.com/2015/07/22/deluxe-tt-rules-now-available-to-all/|title=Deluxe T&T Rules Now Available to ALL!|date=July 22, 2015|author=SSCrompton|publisher=Deluxe Tunnels & Trolls}}</ref>\n\n==Setting==\nThe 5th edition ''Tunnels & Trolls'' core ruleset does not detail a specific setting, saying only that gameplay occurs in \"a world somewhat but not exactly similar to Tolkien's [[Middle-earth|Middle Earth]].\" In an interview in 1986, Ken St. Andre stated that \"my conception of the ''T&T'' world was based on ''The Lord of The Rings'' as it would have been done by Marvel Comics in 1974 with [[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]], [[Elric]], the [[Gray Mouser]] and a host of badguys thrown in.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.garenewing.co.uk/tnt/interview.html |title=T&T Interviews |publisher=Garenewing.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-08-24}}</ref>\n\nThe current Deluxe Edition includes Ken St. Andre's house campaign setting, Trollworld. Along with additional material by early players Jim \"Bear\" Peters and Liz Danforth.\n\n==Gameplay==\n\n===Prime attributes===\nEight prime attributes define characters in ''Tunnels & Trolls'':\n\n*'''Strength (ST)''' determines which weapons the character can use and how much the character can carry. It also serves as magic points in 5th and earlier editions.\n*'''Intelligence (IQ)''' measures the character's ability to think and remember facts.\n*'''Luck (LK)''' affects combat results and saving throws.\n*'''Constitution (CON)''' measures how healthy the character is and how much damage the character can take before being killed.\n*'''Dexterity (DEX)''' represents agility, nimbleness and affects marksmanship.\n*'''Charisma (CHR)''' represents attractiveness and leadership ability.\n\nLater editions add the following prime attributes:\n\n*'''Wizardry (WIZ)''' replaces Strength for powering magic points. Also called '''Power (POW)''' in the 5.5 Edition.\n*'''Speed (SPD)''' represents reaction speed and, in some editions, movement rate.\n\nA new character begins with a randomly generated score for each attribute, determined by rolling three six-side dice.\n\n===Character races===\nThe rules recommend that novice players create human characters, but also offer the options of [[elves]], [[dwarf (Middle-earth)|dwarves]], and [[hobbit]]s. Other races, like [[leprechaun]]s and [[fairy|fairies]], serve as additional character options. A character's race affects his or her attributes. A player may also choose to play as a \"monster race\" such as a zombie or vampire.\n\n===Character classes===\nPlayers also choose a character class for their character. The two base classes are Warriors and Wizards. Wizards can cast spells but have combat limitations. While Warriors cannot cast magic, they are allowed the full use of weapons and armor is twice as effective in blocking damage. Rogues and Warrior-Wizards are also available as character classes. These two classes both combine the abilities of the Warrior and the Wizard. Rogues in ''Tunnels & Trolls'' are not thieves, unlike the Rogue classes in ''[[Character class (Dungeons & Dragons)|Dungeons & Dragons]]'', but could be more accurately described as 'Rogue Wizards'. Rogues are limited in their spell-casting abilities, can utilize the full range of combat weapons and armor as a warrior but do not receive the Warrior's armor bonus or the Wizard's spell-creating ability. Warrior-Wizards are not so limited, but the player must be lucky with the dice when creating the character: high minimum attribute scores are required. Later editions include new classes such as Specialist Mage, Paragon (a renaming of the Warrior-Wizard), Leader, and Ranger.\n\n===Starting equipment and money===\nNew characters begin with a number of gold pieces determined by rolling three six-sided dice and multiplying the total by ten. These gold pieces can be used to buy weapons, armor, and other equipment.\n\n===Combat===\nCombat is handled by comparing dice rolls between a character and his opponent. Both sides roll a number of dice determined by which weapon is in use, then modify the appropriate result by \"personal adds\". Totals are compared, with the higher roll damaging the opposing combatant by the difference in totals. Armor absorbs this damage taken, and any amount remaining is subtracted from the Constitution attribute.\n\n''Tunnels & Trolls'' is unusual among roleplaying games in conducting mass combat resolution with one set of rolls, as the above system applies to combats between any number of opponents.\n\nPersonal adds are determined by Strength, Luck, and Dexterity. For every point above 12 possessed in each of these attributes, the character receives a one-point bonus to his personal adds. Similarly, for every point below 9 possessed in each of these attributes, the character receives a one-point penalty.\n\nIn the 7th Edition, the formula was changed to include Speed in the personal adds.  This also applies to the Deluxe Edition.\n\nThe 5.5, 7th and Deluxe edition include 'spite damage' whereby each \"6\" rolled on the combat dice causes a minimum of one damage to be inflicted on the opposing side, regardless of armor or the respective combat totals. This helped resolve the interminable stalemate that could occur between evenly matched, heavily armored opponents.\n\n===Saving rolls===\nThe Saving Roll (SR) is used during combat to break a stalemate or overcome the characters being outmatched as well as for use of ranged weapons. The SR is also used in all other tests of skill or luck the characters may be presented with by the GM or solo adventure. Checks are made using a character's attribute plus 2d6 (doubles add and roll over) against a difficulty level based on the task at hand.

One example is the [[Grimtooth's Traps]] series, authored by Paul O'Connor (and others), that is a listing of traps that GMs can insert into their adventures.\n\n===Spin-offs===\n''[[Monsters!

It is currently available from Flying Buffalo.\n\n''[[Mercenaries, Spies and Private Eyes]]'' is a variant system, credited to [[Michael A. Stackpole]]. Publication was by Flying Buffalo, who released it in 1983, and [[Sleuth Publications Ltd.]] in 1986. While the basics are the same, it adds a skill system, changes the time scale of combat rounds, and includes rules for modern weapons.\n\n===Video games===\nIn the 1980s, a [[ColecoVision]] adaptation was announced but never released.\n\nIn 1990 a computer version (''[[Crusaders of Khazan]]'') was published by [[New World Computing]], which embedded portions of many of the favorite old solo modules.

The second modern role-playing game published, it was written by Ken St. Andre to be a more accessible alternative to ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZExaEP-g_A |title=A Chat with Ken St Andre Part 1  |publisher=LordStrange YouTube.com |date= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYlRHXRjsFg |title=A Chat with Ken St Andre Part 2  |publisher=LordStrange YouTube.com |date= |accessdate=}}</ref> and is suitable for solitaire, group, and play-by-mail gameplay.\n\n==History==\nKen St. Andre, a public librarian in Phoenix, Arizona, liked the idea of fantasy role-playing after reading a friend's ''D&D'' rule books but found the actual rules confusing, so he wrote his own. \"I just wanted something I could play with my friends at a reasonable price, with reasonable equipment,\u201d he said.<ref name=dragon /> The first edition of ''Tunnels & Trolls'' was self-published in April 1975.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.garenewing.co.uk/tnt/interview.html| year = 1986| title = The Ken St Andre/Demon Issue Interview}}</ref> In June 1975, publisher Flying Buffalo Inc. released a second edition of the game, and Tunnels & Trolls quickly became D&D's biggest competitor.<ref name=ODaM>{{cite book | first=David M. | last=Ewalt | authorlink= David M.

This edition was also translated and published abroad in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]],<ref>In Germany ''Tunnels & Trolls'' was released as ''Schwerter & D\u00e4monen'' in September 1983, two months earlier than ''Dungeons & Dragons'', it was the very first roleplaying game available in German.<br/>{{cite book|last = Evers|first = Momo|title=Magische Zeiten|edition=1st|date=January 2005|publisher=[[Fantasy Productions]]|language=German|isbn=3-89064-516-X}}<br/>{{cite book|last=[[Ken St. Andre]] |first=Rick Loomis|title=Schwerter & D\u00e4monen|edition=1st|date=September 1983|publisher=[[Fantasy Productions]]|language=German|isbn=3-89064-000-1}}</ref> [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Finland]], [[Japan]], and it entered these markets before ''Dungeons & Dragons'' did in most cases.\n\nIn 1999 ''[[Pyramid (magazine)|Pyramid]]'' magazine named ''Tunnels & Trolls'' as one of ''The Millennium's Most Underrated Games''.  Editor [[Scott Haring]] said of the game \"everybody knows this was the second ever fantasy roleplaying game ... But to dismiss it as just an opportunistic ripoff would be grossly unfair. Flying Buffalo's ''T&T'' had its own zany feel \u2013 it was much less serious than ''D&D'' \u2013 and a less-complicated game system.\"<ref>{{cite journal| title=Second Sight: The Millennium's Most Influential Company and The Millennium's Most Underrated Game|journal=[[Pyramid (magazine)|Pyramid]] (online)|last=Haring| first=Scott D. |authorlink=Scott Haring | url= http://www.sjgames.com/pyramid/login/article.html?id=1240| date=1999-11-25| accessdate=2008-02-17}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, [[Flying Buffalo]] updated the 5th edition rules with a \"5.5\" publication that added about 40 pages of extra material. That same year, [[Fiery Dragon Productions]] produced a ''30th Anniversary Edition'' under license in a tin box complete with CD, map, and monster counters, and two new versions of the rules. Ken St. Andre used the opportunity to extensively update the style of play and introduce new role-playing concepts, such as character level determined by character attribute statistics instead of arbitrary numbers of experience points. The ''30th Anniversary'' rules are generally known as the 7th edition. One of the most significant innovations of 7th edition is the introduction of a skills system. The 7.5 edition was released in 2008 by Fiery Dragon, being an update and clarification on the 30th Anniversary Edition.\n\nIn 2012, Tunnels & Trolls was re-introduced in French-speaking markets by [[Grimtooth]] under license by Flying Buffalo. The French rulebook, which is officially the 8th edition, is based on the 7th edition, but includes elements taken from the 5.5 edition as well as clarifications by Ken St. Andre. The interior artwork includes the illustrations of the 5th edition, plus new inks by [[Liz Danforth]]. Several other products (solos and GM adventures) have already been released via Lulu.com and others have been announced.\n\nThe production work for the 8th edition prompted Flying Buffalo to start working on a Deluxe (9th) Edition of the rulebook.<ref>[http://trollhalla.com/outer-sanctum/2012/07/31/announcing-tunnels-and-trolls-deluxe/ Ken St.Andre Announcing Tunnels and Trolls Deluxe] [http://www.trollishdelver.com/2012/03/deluxe-edition-of-tunnels-trolls.html?showComment=1331512511480&m=0#c5423708491776565668 Explanations on the context of the Deluxe edition project] by [[Liz Danforth]] and [[Steve Crompton]]</ref> As Rick Loomis, head of Flying Buffalo Inc., put it, \"The French edition came out so beautiful that now that I have run out of 5.5, I am not satisfied to just reprint 5.5. I wanted to have a deluxe edition even better than the French one. (Competition is what drives us to be better!)\".  ''Deluxe Tunnels & Trolls'', written by St. Andre with additional design input and editing from longtime players [[Liz Danforth]] and James \"Bear\" Peters, was published in August 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deluxetunnelsandtrolls.wordpress.com/2015/07/22/deluxe-tt-rules-now-available-to-all/|title=Deluxe T&T Rules Now Available to ALL!|date=July 22, 2015|author=SSCrompton|publisher=Deluxe Tunnels & Trolls}}</ref>\n\n==Setting==\nThe 5th edition ''Tunnels & Trolls'' core ruleset does not detail a specific setting, saying only that gameplay occurs in \"a world somewhat but not exactly similar to Tolkien's [[Middle-earth|Middle Earth]].\" In an interview in 1986, Ken St. Andre stated that \"my conception of the ''T&T'' world was based on ''The Lord of The Rings'' as it would have been done by Marvel Comics in 1974 with [[Conan the Barbarian|Conan]], [[Elric]], the [[Gray Mouser]] and a host of badguys thrown in.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.garenewing.co.uk/tnt/interview.html |title=T&T Interviews |publisher=Garenewing.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-08-24}}</ref>\n\nThe current Deluxe Edition includes Ken St. Andre's house campaign setting, Trollworld. Along with additional material by early players Jim \"Bear\" Peters and Liz Danforth.\n\n==Gameplay==\n\n===Prime attributes===\nEight prime attributes define characters in ''Tunnels & Trolls'':\n\n*'''Strength (ST)''' determines which weapons the character can use and how much the character can carry. It also serves as magic points in 5th and earlier editions.\n*'''Intelligence (IQ)''' measures the character's ability to think and remember facts.\n*'''Luck (LK)''' affects combat results and saving throws.\n*'''Constitution (CON)''' measures how healthy the character is and how much damage the character can take before being killed.\n*'''Dexterity (DEX)''' represents agility, nimbleness and affects marksmanship.\n*'''Charisma (CHR)''' represents attractiveness and leadership ability.\n\nLater editions add the following prime attributes:\n\n*'''Wizardry (WIZ)''' replaces Strength for powering magic points. Also called '''Power (POW)''' in the 5.5 Edition.\n*'''Speed (SPD)''' represents reaction speed and, in some editions, movement rate.\n\nA new character begins with a randomly generated score for each attribute, determined by rolling three six-side dice.\n\n===Character races===\nThe rules recommend that novice players create human characters, but also offer the options of [[elves]], [[dwarf (Middle-earth)|dwarves]], and [[hobbit]]s. Other races, like [[leprechaun]]s and [[fairy|fairies]], serve as additional character options. A character's race affects his or her attributes. A player may also choose to play as a \"monster race\" such as a zombie or vampire.\n\n===Character classes===\nPlayers also choose a character class for their character. The two base classes are Warriors and Wizards. Wizards can cast spells but have combat limitations. While Warriors cannot cast magic, they are allowed the full use of weapons and armor is twice as effective in blocking damage. Rogues and Warrior-Wizards are also available as character classes. These two classes both combine the abilities of the Warrior and the Wizard. Rogues in ''Tunnels & Trolls'' are not thieves, unlike the Rogue classes in ''[[Character class (Dungeons & Dragons)|Dungeons & Dragons]]'', but could be more accurately described as 'Rogue Wizards'. Rogues are limited in their spell-casting abilities, can utilize the full range of combat weapons and armor as a warrior but do not receive the Warrior's armor bonus or the Wizard's spell-creating ability. Warrior-Wizards are not so limited, but the player must be lucky with the dice when creating the character: high minimum attribute scores are required. Later editions include new classes such as Specialist Mage, Paragon (a renaming of the Warrior-Wizard), Leader, and Ranger.\n\n===Starting equipment and money===\nNew characters begin with a number of gold pieces determined by rolling three six-sided dice and multiplying the total by ten. These gold pieces can be used to buy weapons, armor, and other equipment.\n\n===Combat===\nCombat is handled by comparing dice rolls between a character and his opponent. Both sides roll a number of dice determined by which weapon is in use, then modify the appropriate result by \"personal adds\". Totals are compared, with the higher roll damaging the opposing combatant by the difference in totals. Armor absorbs this damage taken, and any amount remaining is subtracted from the Constitution attribute.\n\n''Tunnels & Trolls'' is unusual among roleplaying games in conducting mass combat resolution with one set of rolls, as the above system applies to combats between any number of opponents.\n\nPersonal adds are determined by Strength, Luck, and Dexterity. For every point above 12 possessed in each of these attributes, the character receives a one-point bonus to his personal adds. Similarly, for every point below 9 possessed in each of these attributes, the character receives a one-point penalty.\n\nIn the 7th Edition, the formula was changed to include Speed in the personal adds.  This also applies to the Deluxe Edition.\n\nThe 5.5, 7th and Deluxe edition include 'spite damage' whereby each \"6\" rolled on the combat dice causes a minimum of one damage to be inflicted on the opposing side, regardless of armor or the respective combat totals. This helped resolve the interminable stalemate that could occur between evenly matched, heavily armored opponents.\n\n===Saving rolls===\nThe Saving Roll (SR) is used during combat to break a stalemate or overcome the characters being outmatched as well as for use of ranged weapons. The SR is also used in all other tests of skill or luck the characters may be presented with by the GM or solo adventure. Checks are made using a character's attribute plus 2d6 (doubles add and roll over) against a difficulty level based on the task at hand. For every level of saving roll the formula is 15+5x, with x being the level of difficulty. This was one of the earliest uses of this mechanic in RPGs.\n\n==Reception==\nIn the third issue of ''[[The Space Gamer]]'', Brant Bates called the first edition of ''Tunnels & Trolls'' \"very playable, and a lot of fun\", and recommended it for fantasy fans who are \"not purists.\"<ref name=\"SG3\">{{cite journal|last=Bates|first=Brant |date=1975 |title=Tunnels and Trolls: A Review of Sorts|journal=[[The Space Gamer]]|publisher=[[Metagaming Concepts|Metagaming]]|issue=3|pages=16-17}}</ref> \n\nFive years later, in the March\u2013April 1980 edition of ''The Space Gamer'' (Issue 27), [[Steve Jackson (American game designer)|Steve Jackson]] said of the 5th edition, \"On the whole, a good book, worth the price for any adventure gamer just for the ideas and comments it holds.

In Ken St. Andre's editorial in the first issue (Winter 1978) the magazine was described as a \"'zine based around T&T specifically and fantasy role-playing in general\".\n\n===Reference publications===\nA number of books were published that support GMs by giving them ideas for \"traps\" and other tools for creating adventures when designing a dungeon or adventure.  One example is the [[Grimtooth's Traps]] series, authored by Paul O'Connor (and others), that is a listing of traps that GMs can insert into their adventures.\n\n===Spin-offs===\n''[[Monsters! Monsters!]]'' is a subset of the ''T&T'' rules tailored to playing monsters. It is fully compatible with 5th edition. Copyright dates listed are 1976 and 1979, published by Metagaming and then Flying Buffalo. It is occasionally reprinted as photocopies by the author, Ken St. Andre. It is currently available from Flying Buffalo.\n\n''[[Mercenaries, Spies and Private Eyes]]'' is a variant system, credited to [[Michael A. Stackpole]]. Publication was by Flying Buffalo, who released it in 1983, and [[Sleuth Publications Ltd.]] in 1986. While the basics are the same, it adds a skill system, changes the time scale of combat rounds, and includes rules for modern weapons.\n\n===Video games===\nIn the 1980s, a [[ColecoVision]] adaptation was announced but never released.\n\nIn 1990 a computer version (''[[Crusaders of Khazan]]'') was published by [[New World Computing]], which embedded portions of many of the favorite old solo modules. ''Crusaders of Khazan'' is included in the ''30th Anniversary Edition'' tin, but not the PDF version.\n\nIn 2017, MetaArcade has published ''[[Tunnels & Trolls Adventures]]'' for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]], an adaptation of ''Tunnels & Trolls'' featuring over 20 classic quests.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.mmorpg.com/news/tunnels-and-trolls-adventures-launches-on-ios-and-android-1000045249|title=Tunnels & Trolls Adventures Launches on iOS & Android -  MMORPG.com News|work=MMORPG.com|access-date=2017-08-21|language=en-US}}</ref> According to MetaArcade, new content will be published on a regular basis.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.metaarcade.com/blogroll/2017/8/17/tunnels-trolls-adventures-is-live-play-for-free|title=Tunnels & Trolls Adventures is Live!

He took it upon himself to train harder and longer than everyone else in order never to be a victim. At night, when everyone else was asleep, he would be outside running or climbing trees. He would use the military [[obstacle course]]s in secret, and also created courses of his own that tested his endurance, strength, and flexibility. Doing this enabled him not only to survive the hardships he experienced during his childhood, but also eventually to thrive. After the [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu]] in 1954, he returned to France and remained in military education until the age of 19, when he joined the [[Paris Fire Brigade]], a French Army unit.<ref name=\"CineP20\"/><ref name=\"Parkour-DB1\">[[#Belle2|Belle]], p. 23\u201330</ref><ref name=\"Raymond Belle Bio\">{{cite web |url=http://parkour.net/modules/articles/item.php?itemid=3 |title=Raymond Belle's biography |date=17 February 2006 |work=Original French biography sourced from 'Allo Dix-Huit', the magazine of the Parisian pompiers. |publisher=Parkour.NET |accessdate=29 November 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060217200929/http://parkour.net/modules/articles/item.php?itemid=3 |archivedate=17 February 2006}}</ref>\n\n[[File:David Belle NewYorker.jpg|thumb|[[David Belle]] is considered the founder of parkour.]]\nRaymond's son, [[David Belle]], was born in 1973. He experimented with [[gymnastics]] and [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]] but became increasingly disaffected with both school and the [[sports club]]s. As he got older, he claims to have to read as-yet-unconfirmed newspaper clippings that told of his father's exploits and was increasingly curious about what had enabled his father to accomplish these feats. Through conversations with his father, he realised that what he really wanted was a means to develop skills that would be useful to him in life, rather than just training to kick a ball or perform moves in a padded, indoor environment.<ref name=\"CineP20\"/><ref name=\"Parkour-DB2\"/>\n\nThrough   conversations with his father, David learned about this way of training that his father called \"''parcours''\". He heard his father talk of the many repetitions he had done in order to find the best way of doing things. He learned  that for his father, training was not a game but something vital which enabled him to survive and to protect the people he cared about. David realised that this was what he had been searching for, and so he began training in the same way. After a time, he found it far more important to him than schooling and he gave up his other commitments to focus all his time on his training.<ref name=\"Parkour-DB2\"/>\n\n===Yamakasi===\n{{main|Yamakasi}}\nDavid initially trained on his own, and after moving to [[Lisses]], found other young men (including his cousins) who had similar desires, and they began to train together.<ref name=\"Nacho\" /> The group eventually included David Belle, [[S\u00e9bastien Foucan]], Ch\u00e2u Belle Dinh, Williams Belle, Yann Hnautra, Laurent Piemontesi, Guylain N'Guba Boyeke, Malik Diouf, and Charles Perri\u00e8re.\n\n====Discipline====\nThe group put themselves through challenges that forced them to find the physical and mental strength to succeed. Examples included training without food or water, or sleeping on the floor without a blanket, to learn to endure the cold.<ref>[[#Angel|Angel]], p. 23</ref> For example, no one in the group was permitted to be late for training, as it would hold back the whole group. If any member completed a challenge, everyone else had to do the same thing.<ref name=\"David Belle p.43\">[[#Belle|Belle and Perri\u00e9re]], p. 43</ref> During their training no one was allowed to complain or be negative. Few excuses were allowed. For instance, if someone claimed that his shoes were too worn out in order to make a jump, he had to do it anyway, even if it meant doing the jump barefoot.<ref name=\"David Belle p.42\"/> At the same time, everyone was required to have knowledge of their own limits.<ref name=\"David Belle p.46\">[[#Belle|Belle and Perri\u00e9re]], p. 46</ref>\n\nRespecting one's health and physical well-being was one of the foundations of the group. If any member hurt himself during or after the execution of a movement, the movement was deemed a failure. A movement executed only once was not considered an achievement; only with repetition was the challenge complete. Every movement had to be repeated at least ten times in a row without the traceur having to push his limits or sustaining any injury. If any mistake was made by any traceur in the group everyone had to start all over again.<ref name=\"David Belle p.43\"/>\n\nHumility was an important principle.<ref name=\"David Belle p.46\"/> No traceur was allowed to feel superior over someone else, for example by executing a movement only to show off in front of someone who could not perform the movement. If any traceur in the group claimed that he had completed a difficult and dangerous challenge that should not be attempted unaided, he had to prove his claims by doing the challenge again. Anyone who lied violated the principle of humility.<ref name=\"David Belle p.43\"/>\n\nTo join the group, new members had to be recommended by an existing member and then pass tests to evaluate their motivation for joining.<ref name=\"David Belle p.42\">[[#Belle|Belle and Perri\u00e9re]], p. 42</ref> Despite the huge emphasis on the collective, each traceur had to progress and develop independently \u2014 \"to create the means to be yourself\"<ref>[[#Belle|Belle and Perri\u00e9re]], p. 53</ref> \u2014 and there was a complete trust within the group.<ref name=\"David Belle p.46\"/> Every traceur was to encourage the others and show confidence through their behaviour.<ref name=\"David Belle p.47\">[[#Belle|Belle and Perri\u00e9re]], p. 47</ref> If a member violated the principles, the group could meet without the offending person to discuss various punishments. Anyone deemed unsuitable could be temporarily or even permanently banned from the group in order to uphold its disciplines and values.<ref>[[#Belle|Belle and Perri\u00e9re]], p. 44</ref>\n\nThe group also drew influence from Asian cultures, notably the acrobatic antics of [[Jackie Chan]] in his [[Hong Kong action films]],<ref>{{cite book |last1=Stratford |first1=Elaine |title=Geographies, Mobilities, and Rhythms over the Life-Course: Adventures in the Interval |date=2014 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=9781135117429 |page=79 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d4yLBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA79}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Hunt |first1=Leon |last2=Wing-Fai |first2=Leung |title=East Asian Cinemas: Exploring Transnational Connections on Film |date=2010 |publisher=[[I.B.

S\u00e9bastien Foucan also invented a name for what they were doing: \"''l'art du d\u00e9placement''{{-\"}} (French for \"the art of movement\").<ref name=\"CineP35\"/> The firefighter performance caused both positive and negative attention. Some members of the group were concerned how the public would view their discipline since the performance did not demonstrate all aspects of it, such as their hard training and their values and ethics. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois also sent pictures and video of the group to a French TV programme, and the popularity of parkour began to increase. A series of television programmes in various countries subsequently featured video footage of the group, and they began to get more requests for performances. During this time, conflicting interests arose within the group. S\u00e9bastien Foucan wanted to teach more rather than to train more, and David Belle had the ambition to become an actor. David and S\u00e9bastien chose to leave the group, and used the name \"parkour\" to describe their activity (see [[Parkour#Etymology|\u00a7 Etymology]] above). The seven remaining Yamakasi members continued to use the term ''l'art du d\u00e9placement''<ref name=\"CineP20\"/><ref name=\"Parkour-DB3\">[[#Belle2|Belle]], pp. 71\u201379</ref> (see [[Parkour#Derivative terminologies and disciplines|\u00a7 Derivative terminologies and disciplines]] below).\n\n==Organizations==\nNational parkour organizations include the [[World Freerunning and Parkour Federation]], established in 2007, who have worked with [[MTV]] to produce Parkour related shows.<ref>[https://wfpf.com/history-wfpf/ History of WFPF] wfpf.com</ref>\n\n[[International Gymnastics Federation]] (FIG) added parkour as one of their disciplines in 2017, receiving lots of opposition.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.accessparkour.com/fig-gate-the-story-so-far/|title=Fig-Gate: The Great Parkour Scandal|date=11 May 2017|publisher=accessparkour.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1051013/denmark-add-voice-to-opposition-of-figs-move-into-parkour|title=Denmark add voice to opposition of FIG's move into parkour|publisher=insidethegames.biz|date=1 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1053647/parkour-earth-officially-becomes-sports-international-federation-as-fig-row-continues|title=Parkour Earth officially launches as FIG row continues|publisher=insidethegames.biz|date=4 August 2017}}</ref> Programme includes Speed-Run (Sprint) and Freestyle.

Parkour is unique and cannot be a competitive sport unless it ignores its altruistic core of self-development. If parkour becomes a sport, it will be hard to seriously teach and spread parkour as a non-competitive activity. And a new sport will be spread that may be called parkour, but that won't hold its philosophical essence anymore.\"<ref name=\"rivalry-free\"/> Red Bull's sponsored athlete for parkour, Ryan Doyle, has said, \"Sometimes people ask, 'Who is the best at parkour?' and it is because they don't understand what Parkour is; 'Who is the best?' is what you would say to a sport, and parkour is not a sport, it is an art, it's a discipline.

What I'm interested in is what the guy's got in his head, if he has self-confidence, if he masters the technique, if he has understood the principles of parkour. I just can't deal with guys who do Parkour because they saw videos on the Internet and thought it was kinda cool and want to do even better.\"<ref>[[#Belle2|Belle]], p. 58</ref> Further, he states the importance of traceurs being aware of their abilities and limitations, and developing in their own way. \"When a young person asks me: 'Can you show me how to do this?' I simply answer: \"No, I am going to show you how ''I'' do it. Then, you'll have to learn with your own technique, your own way of moving, your style, your abilities and your limitations.

If you're not better than you were the day before, then what are you doing\u2014what's the point?\".<ref name=\"No Obstacles\" /> In an interview with the press, Belle explained that parkour is a training method for warriors. \"So many people try to train easy 'Come do parkour!

That's what you need to know: you are going to cry, you are going to bleed and you are going to sweat like never before.\"<ref>Cine parkour, p.22</ref> In his book, Belle also quotes his father Raymond: \"If two roads open up before you, always take the most difficult one. Because you know you can travel the easy one.\"<ref>[[#Belle2|Belle]], p. 27</ref>\n\nBelle is an influential proponent of discipline and control in parkour, saying, \"Precision is all about being measured,\" and going on to describe parkour as an art that requires huge amounts of repetition and practice to master.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUeHrPazTtY |title=David Belle \u2013 Parkour |publisher=YouTube |date=16 July 2011 |accessdate=22 May 2014}}</ref> \"With parkour, I often say, 'Once is never'.

During the [[First Indochina War]], his father died and he was separated from his mother, after which he was sent to a military orphanage in [[Da Lat]] at the age of 7. He took it upon himself to train harder and longer than everyone else in order never to be a victim. At night, when everyone else was asleep, he would be outside running or climbing trees. He would use the military [[obstacle course]]s in secret, and also created courses of his own that tested his endurance, strength, and flexibility. Doing this enabled him not only to survive the hardships he experienced during his childhood, but also eventually to thrive. After the [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu]] in 1954, he returned to France and remained in military education until the age of 19, when he joined the [[Paris Fire Brigade]], a French Army unit.<ref name=\"CineP20\"/><ref name=\"Parkour-DB1\">[[#Belle2|Belle]], p. 23\u201330</ref><ref name=\"Raymond Belle Bio\">{{cite web |url=http://parkour.net/modules/articles/item.php?itemid=3 |title=Raymond Belle's biography |date=17 February 2006 |work=Original French biography sourced from 'Allo Dix-Huit', the magazine of the Parisian pompiers. |publisher=Parkour.NET |accessdate=29 November 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060217200929/http://parkour.net/modules/articles/item.php?itemid=3 |archivedate=17 February 2006}}</ref>\n\n[[File:David Belle NewYorker.jpg|thumb|[[David Belle]] is considered the founder of parkour.]]\nRaymond's son, [[David Belle]], was born in 1973. He experimented with [[gymnastics]] and [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]] but became increasingly disaffected with both school and the [[sports club]]s. As he got older, he started to read the newspaper clippings{{which|date=March 2016}} that told of his father's exploits and was increasingly curious about what had enabled his father to accomplish these feats. Through conversations with his father, he realised that what he really wanted was a means to develop skills that would be useful to him in life, rather than just training to kick a ball or perform moves in a padded, indoor environment.<ref name=\"CineP20\"/><ref name=\"Parkour-DB2\"/>\n\nThrough   conversations with his father, David learned about this way of training that his father called \"''parcours''\". He heard his father talk of the many repetitions he had done in order to find the best way of doing things. He learned  that for his father, training was not a game but something vital which enabled him to survive and to protect the people he cared about. David realised that this was what he had been searching for, and so he began training in the same way. After a time, he found it far more important to him than schooling and he gave up his other commitments to focus all his time on his training.<ref name=\"Parkour-DB2\"/>\n\n===Yamakasi===\n{{main|Yamakasi}}\nDavid initially trained on his own, and after moving to [[Lisses]], found other young men (including his cousins) who had similar desires, and they began to train together.<ref name=\"Nacho\" /> The group eventually included David Belle, [[S\u00e9bastien Foucan]], Ch\u00e2u Belle Dinh, Williams Belle, Yann Hnautra, Laurent Piemontesi, Guylain N'Guba Boyeke, Malik Diouf, and Charles Perri\u00e8re.\n\n====Discipline====\nThe group put themselves through challenges that forced them to find the physical and mental strength to succeed. Examples included training without food or water, or sleeping on the floor without a blanket, to learn to endure the cold.<ref>[[#Angel|Angel]], p. 23</ref> For example, no one in the group was permitted to be late for training, as it would hold back the whole group. If any member completed a challenge, everyone else had to do the same thing.<ref name=\"David Belle p.43\">[[#Belle|Belle and Perri\u00e9re]], p. 43</ref> During their training no one was allowed to complain or be negative. Few excuses were allowed. For instance, if someone claimed that his shoes were too worn out in order to make a jump, he had to do it anyway, even if it meant doing the jump barefoot.<ref name=\"David Belle p.42\"/> At the same time, everyone was required to have knowledge of their own limits.<ref name=\"David Belle p.46\">[[#Belle|Belle and Perri\u00e9re]], p. 46</ref>\n\nRespecting one's health and physical well-being was one of the foundations of the group. If any member hurt himself during or after the execution of a movement, the movement was deemed a failure. A movement executed only once was not considered an achievement; only with repetition was the challenge complete. Every movement had to be repeated at least ten times in a row without the traceur having to push his limits or sustaining any injury. If any mistake was made by any traceur in the group everyone had to start all over again.<ref name=\"David Belle p.43\"/>\n\nHumility was an important principle.<ref name=\"David Belle p.46\"/> No traceur was allowed to feel superior over someone else, for example by executing a movement only to show off in front of someone who could not perform the movement. If any traceur in the group claimed that he had completed a difficult and dangerous challenge that should not be attempted unaided, he had to prove his claims by doing the challenge again. Anyone who lied violated the principle of humility.<ref name=\"David Belle p.43\"/>\n\nTo join the group, new members had to be recommended by an existing member and then pass tests to evaluate their motivation for joining.<ref name=\"David Belle p.42\">[[#Belle|Belle and Perri\u00e9re]], p. 42</ref> Despite the huge emphasis on the collective, each traceur had to progress and develop independently \u2014 \"to create the means to be yourself\"<ref>[[#Belle|Belle and Perri\u00e9re]], p. 53</ref> \u2014 and there was a complete trust within the group.<ref name=\"David Belle p.46\"/> Every traceur was to encourage the others and show confidence through their behaviour.<ref name=\"David Belle p.47\">[[#Belle|Belle and Perri\u00e9re]], p. 47</ref> If a member violated the principles, the group could meet without the offending person to discuss various punishments. Anyone deemed unsuitable could be temporarily or even permanently banned from the group in order to uphold its disciplines and values.<ref>[[#Belle|Belle and Perri\u00e9re]], p. 44</ref>\n\nThe group also drew influence from Asian cultures, notably the acrobatic antics of [[Jackie Chan]] in his [[Hong Kong action films]],<ref>{{cite book |last1=Stratford |first1=Elaine |title=Geographies, Mobilities, and Rhythms over the Life-Course: Adventures in the Interval |date=2014 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=9781135117429 |page=79 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d4yLBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA79}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Hunt |first1=Leon |last2=Wing-Fai |first2=Leung |title=East Asian Cinemas: Exploring Transnational Connections on Film |date=2010 |publisher=[[I.B.

S\u00e9bastien Foucan also invented a name for what they were doing: \"''l'art du d\u00e9placement''{{-\"}} (French for \"the art of movement\").<ref name=\"CineP35\"/> The firefighter performance caused both positive and negative attention. Some members of the group were concerned how the public would view their discipline since the performance did not demonstrate all aspects of it, such as their hard training and their values and ethics. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois also sent pictures and video of the group to a French TV programme, and the popularity of parkour began to increase. A series of television programmes in various countries subsequently featured video footage of the group, and they began to get more requests for performances. During this time, conflicting interests arose within the group. S\u00e9bastien Foucan wanted to teach more rather than to train more, and David Belle had the ambition to become an actor. David and S\u00e9bastien chose to leave the group, and used the name \"parkour\" to describe their activity (see [[Parkour#Etymology|\u00a7 Etymology]] above).

What I'm interested in is what the guy's got in his head, if he has self-confidence, if he masters the technique, if he has understood the principles of parkour. I just can't deal with guys who do Parkour because they saw videos on the Internet and thought it was kinda cool and want to do even better.\"<ref>[[#Belle2|Belle]], p. 58</ref> Further, he states the importance of traceurs being aware of their abilities and limitations, and developing in their own way. \"When a young person asks me: 'Can you show me how to do this?' I simply answer: \"No, I am going to show you how ''I'' do it. Then, you'll have to learn with your own technique, your own way of moving, your style, your abilities and your limitations.

If you're not better than you were the day before, then what are you doing\u2014what's the point?\".<ref name=\"No Obstacles\" /> In an interview with the press, Belle explained that parkour is a training method for warriors. \"So many people try to train easy 'Come do parkour!

That's what you need to know: you are going to cry, you are going to bleed and you are going to sweat like never before.\"<ref>Cine parkour, p.22</ref> In his book, Belle also quotes his father Raymond: \"If two roads open up before you, always take the most difficult one. Because you know you can travel the easy one.\"<ref>[[#Belle2|Belle]], p. 27</ref>\n\nBelle is an influential proponent of discipline and control in parkour, saying, \"Precision is all about being measured,\" and going on to describe parkour as an art that requires huge amounts of repetition and practice to master.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUeHrPazTtY |title=David Belle \u2013 Parkour |publisher=YouTube |date=16 July 2011 |accessdate=22 May 2014}}</ref> \"With parkour, I often say, 'Once is never'. In other words, someone can manage a jump one time but it does not mean anything. It can be luck or chance. When you make a jump, you have to do it at least three times to be sure you can actually do it. It's an unavoidable rule. Do it the hard way and stop lying to yourself.

This gives them the power to pick the teams for the week's maxi challenge which is to star in two parody films 'Why It Gotta Be Black, Panther?' (parody of '[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]') and 'Good God Girl Get Out' (parody of '[[Get Out]]'). The teams then assign roles and perform in front of the camera while Ross and Michelle direct.\n\nOn the main stage, the category is 'What's Your Sign?' where the queens dress according to their zodiac signs. A'Keria C. Davenport, Honey Davenport, Nina West, Ra'Jah O'Hara, Silky Nutmeg Ganache, and Vanessa Vanjie Mateo are declared safe. Ariel Versace, Brooke Lynn Hytes, Kahanna Montrese, and Mercedes Iman Diamond receive negative critiques of their performances in the challenge but Brooke Lynn and Ariel receive praise for their runway looks. Meanwhile, Plastique Tiara, Scarlet Envy, Shuga Cain, and Yvie Oddly receive positive critiques with Plastique, Scarlet, and Yvie receiving positive feedback on their runways and Shuga receiving mixed reviews. After the judges deliberate Scarlet Envy and Yvie Oddly are both declared the winners of the challenge while Kahanna Montrese and Mercedes Iman Diamond are placed in the bottom two.

They select their teams for the maxi challenge which is to make a parody Christian talk show to worship a diva. Nina's team pick [[Britney Spears]] and Ra'Jah's team select [[Mariah Carey]]. The queens are then directed by Ross and perform their show in one take.\n\nOn the main stage, the category is 'Fringe' and the queens each present a fringe inspired look. Team Nina West are declared the winners of the challenge and Ru compliments both Vanessa Vanjie Mateo and Ariel Versace for their excellent performances but Nina is declared the overall challenge winner. Team Ra'Jah O'Hara is declared the losing team and all six of the team's members (A'Keria C. Davenport, Honey Davenport, Plastique Tiara, Ra'Jah, Scarlet Envy, and Shuga Cain) are critiqued for severely lackluster performances and a general lack of knowledge about Mariah Carey, though most of their runways are well-received. When every member of Team Ra'Jah claims that they were all to blame for the failing challenge, Ru puts every team member up for elimination, having the six of them lipsync to \"[[Waiting for Tonight|Waiting for Tonight (Hex Hector Mix)]]\" by [[Jennifer Lopez]]. Ru announces first that Plastique is safe, followed by Ra'Jah, Scarlet, and A'Keria.

Immediately after the mini challenge, RuPaul brings back to the workroom six queens that were eliminated earlier in the competition -- Shuga Cain, Plastique Tiara, Scarlet Envy, Ariel Versace, Honey Davenport, and Soju. RuPaul then describes the main challenge, where each of the remaining queens has to use her own drag aesthetic to makeover one of the eliminated queens as a member of her drag house. The eliminated queens have to wear large pink gloves during the makeover so they are prevented from doing their own makeup. RuPaul also explains that the eliminated queens would not be returning to the competition and that they are only present for this challenge. Since Brooke Lynn won the mini challenge, she wins the right to pair the remaining and eliminated queens. She chooses Plastique for herself, then pairs Shuga with Nina West, Honey with A'Keria C.

Seven of the queens say Silky should go home, while the other five say Yvie should. Despite everyone expecting Vanessa Vanjie Mateo to win the challenge, Brooke Lynn Hytes is declared the winner of the challenge instead. Nina West and Silky Nutmeg Ganache are declared the bottom two, and the pair lip syncs to \"[[No Scrubs]]\" by [[TLC (group)|TLC]].

While most the queens receive mainly positive critiques for both their runways and performances, particularly Yvie Oddly, both Vanessa Vanjie Mateo and Brooke Lynn Hytes receive negative critiques from the judges. Vanessa is criticized for a disconnect in her performance, which was considered the weakest in the group, and a relatively basic runway look, while Brooke Lynn is panned for lacking 'edge' and passion in the video recording, as well as having the weakest runway look out of everyone, which the judges question as being her 'Best Drag'.

The next day on the main stage, the two groups perform their shows in front of the judges and a live audience,\n\nThe next day on the main stage, the runway category is 'Caftan Realness' and the queens each present their outfits. Ru and the judges then critique the girls and both Brooke Lynn Hytes and Nina West are highly praised for both their outfits and performances. Shuga Cain receives praise for being part of the best team but is critiqued for being overshadowed and Michelle criticizes her [[caftan]] runway (which consisted of three looks and two reveals), stating the original look was strong enough that the other two weren't needed. The other team receive varying levels of negative critiques for their performances, with A'Keria C. Davenport receiving the best critique performance-wise, but Vanessa Vanjie Mateo and Yvie Oddly are particularly praised for their runways.

Brooke Lynn Hytes is deemed to have the best reactions to being slapped and is declared the winner. Immediately after the mini challenge, RuPaul brings back to the workroom six queens that were eliminated earlier in the competition -- Shuga Cain, Plastique Tiara, Scarlet Envy, Ariel Versace, Honey Davenport, and Soju. RuPaul then describes the main challenge, where each of the remaining queens has to use her own drag aesthetic to makeover one of the eliminated queens as a member of her drag house. The eliminated queens have to wear large pink gloves during the makeover so they are prevented from doing their own makeup. RuPaul also explains that the eliminated queens would not be returning to the competition and that they are only present for this challenge. Since Brooke Lynn won the mini challenge, she wins the right to pair the remaining and eliminated queens. She chooses Plastique for herself, then pairs Shuga with Nina West, Honey with A'Keria C. Davenport, Scarlet with Yvie Oddly, Soju with Silky Nutmeg Ganache (much to the latter's dismay), and Ariel with Vanessa Vanjie Mateo.\n\nOn the main stage, A'Keria C. Davenport, Brooke Lynn Hytes, and Vanessa Vanjie Mateo receive positive comments for their respective makeovers, while Nina West, Silky Nutmeg Ganache, and Yvie Oddly receive negative critiques. After the judges' critiques, RuPaul asks all of the queens (both the remaining and eliminated queens) which of the remaining queens deserves to go home and why. Seven of the queens say Silky should go home, while the other five say Yvie should. Despite everyone expecting Vanessa Vanjie Mateo to win the challenge, Brooke Lynn Hytes is declared the winner of the challenge instead. Nina West and Silky Nutmeg Ganache are declared the bottom two, and the pair lip syncs to \"[[No Scrubs]]\" by [[TLC (group)|TLC]].

The queens each record their verses with [[Todrick Hall]] and are later choreographed by him. After each appearing on the podcast the queens take part in the one-take recording of the video, set in a club.\n\nOn the main stage, the queens present their 'Best Drag'. Ru then gets the queens to give advice to (pictures of) their younger selves. The judges then proceed to critique them on their performances. While most the queens receive mainly positive critiques for both their runways and performances, particularly Yvie Oddly, both Vanessa Vanjie Mateo and Brooke Lynn Hytes receive negative critiques from the judges. Vanessa is criticized for a disconnect in her performance, which was considered the weakest in the group, and a relatively basic runway look, while Brooke Lynn is panned for lacking 'edge' and passion in the video recording, as well as having the weakest runway look out of everyone, which the judges question as being her 'Best Drag'. Ru announces that A'Keria C. Davenport, Silky Nutmeg Ganache, and Yvie Oddly all progress on to the finale and places Brooke Lynn Hytes and Vanessa Vanjie Mateo in the bottom two.

He also holds an endowed professorship in the Department of Science Education at [[Ewha Womans University]], where he has worked since 1999. In his research, he has worked on many accelerator-based as well as non-accelerator-based experiments. His current research activities involve a number of accelerators around the world, including the [[Radioactive Isotope Beam Factory|RI Beam Factory]] (RIBF) at [[RIKEN]], [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider]] (RHIC) at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]], and the soon-to-open [[RAON|Rare isotope Accelerator complex for ON-line experiment]] (RAON). During his tenure at Ewha Womans University, he promoted [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]]/STEAM education by serving for multiple years as the director of the Advanced STEAM Teacher Education Center<!--\ucca8\ub2e8\uacfc\ud559 \uad50\uc0ac\uc5f0\uc218\uc13c\ud130-->. He also wrote several physics textbooks for high school students and undergraduate students.\n\n==Education==\nKevin obtained a B.S. in physics from [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA) in 1984. He then enrolled in [[Yale University]] and graduated with a M.S. in physics in 1989 and a Ph.D. in nuclear astrophysics in 1993. His doctoral thesis was on the reaction rates of <sup>17</sup>F(p,\u03b3)<sup>18</sup>Ne and <sup>14</sup>O(\u03b1,p)<sup>17</sup>F and was supervised by Professor Peter Parker. \n\n==Career==\nDoctorate in hand, Kevin went to [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]] and worked for three years as a research fellow in the Kellogg Radiation Laboratory with Prof. Ralph Kavanagh. Relocating to Japan, he spent the next two years as a research fellow at [[RIKEN]] becoming an official RIKEN Fellow from 1996-1997. As a Fellow, he worked with Prof. Ishihara at the Radiation Laboratory at RIKEN and also worked closely with Prof. Motobayashi and Prof. Kubono. The next year he worked as a research professor in the [[University of Houston]] teaching an undergraduate course on [[electromagnetism]] and conducted hypernuclear experiments at Brookhaven National Laboratory and rare decay experiments. From 1999, he worked as a professor in the Department of Science Education, [[Ewha Womans University]], Korea including as an invited chair professor.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ewha.ac.kr/ewhaen/academics/education-prof.do |title= College of Education Faculty |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= [[Ewha Womans University]] |publisher= |access-date= 23 March 2020 |quote= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://ewha.ac.kr/mbs/ewhakr/jsp/sprofile/sprofile_View.jsp?id=ewhaen_030103010000&cateId=7&sabun=MTUwMjE2&tab=TAB2 |title= \uad50\uc218\ud504\ub85c\ud544: Kevin Insik Hahn Invited chair-professor |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= [[Ewha Womans University]] |archive-url= http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:zDBKxqJQ_McJ:www.ewha.ac.kr/mbs/ewhakr/jsp/sprofile/sprofile_View.jsp%3Fid%3Dewhaen_030103010000%26cateId%3D7%26sabun%3DMTUwMjE2%26tab%3DTAB3+&cd=3&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=kr |url-status=dead |archive-date= 5 February 2020 |publisher= |access-date= 27 March 2020 |quote= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://cms.ewha.ac.kr/user/indexSub.action?codyMenuSeq=8160376&siteId=teachers&menuUIType=tab |title= \uacfc\ud559\uad50\uc721\uacfc |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= |publisher= [[Ewha Womans University]] |access-date= 27 March 2020 |quote= \ud55c\uc778\uc2dd() \ucd08\ube59\uc11d\uc88c\uad50\uc218 }}</ref> From 2014, he has worked as a visiting scholar with RAON and the IBS Center for Underground Physics where he worked with [[Korea Invisible Mass Search|KIMS]] (dark matter search), AMoRE (double beta decay experiment), and the HPGe Array.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://cupblog.ibs.re.kr/people/insik-hahn/ |title= Insik Hahn |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= 23 March 2019 |website= IBS Center for Underground Physics |publisher= [[Institute for Basic Science]] |access-date= 11 February 2020 |quote=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://centers.ibs.re.kr/_prog/_personnel/?site_dvs_cd=cup_en&menu_dvs_cd=0207&posi_dvs_cd=122 |title= Collaboration |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= IBS Center for Underground Physics |publisher= [[Institute for Basic Science]] |access-date= 11 February 2020 |quote= }}</ref>\n\nWorking mainly on silicon detector for the [[PHENIX detector|PHENIX collaboration]],<ref>{{cite journal |author= PHENIX Collaboration |date= 10 December 2018 |title= Creation of quark\u2013gluon plasma droplets with three distinct geometries |url= https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-018-0360-0 |journal= Nature Physics |volume= 15 |issue= |pages= 214\u2013220 |doi= 10.1038/s41567-018-0360-0 |access-date= 27 March 2020 }}</ref> he and collaborators found evidence of the [[quark\u2013gluon plasma]], which can be made in small-scale collision systems.

Young John Cornwall was only seventeen when he was killed at the [[Siege of Meaux]].  He died next to his father, who witnessed his son's head being blown off by a [[round shot|gun-stone]].  Sir John was deeply affected by witnessing the death of his son and heir, and vowed never to wage war on Christian princes.<ref>Barker, Juliet., Agincourt (London, 2005) pg. 152</ref>  Sir John and Elizabeth's daughter was Constance Cornwall who married [[John FitzAlan, 14th Earl of Arundel]], and died in 1427. Neither of Sir John's children had any children of their own.  Sir John was a father of two illegitimate sons by a \"Mistress Ewen\", John and Thomas, whom he recognised in his will. Elizabeth died on November 24, 1425 and was buried at [[St Mary's Church, Burford]], [[Shropshire]], England.\n\n==Peerage and military career==\n[[File:Sir John Cornewaille, 1st Baron Fanhope and Milbroke, KG.png|thumb|left|Coat of arms of Sir John Cornewaille, 1st Baron Fanhope and Milbroke, KG]]\nSir John excelled in combat and was victorious in numerous [[tournament]]s, defeating many other [[knight]]s in [[m\u00eal\u00e9e]] combat. During the [[Middle Ages]], tournaments were regarded as the greatest test of a warrior's skill and valour; an idea reinforced by the prominent place that it occupied in popular Arthurian lore of the era.\n\nAs a soldier, Sir John had a long and distinguished career, serving in many campaigns. Early in his career, he served for King [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] in [[Scotland]], fought for the Duke of Lancaster in [[Brittany]], and fought for King Henry IV against [[Owain Glynd\u0175r]] during the Welsh Uprising. Sir John continued his military service for King [[Henry V of England|Henry V]] and King [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] during the [[Hundred Years' War]], most notably during the battle of [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt]], where he led the English vanguard on the march from [[Harfleur]]. He also served as a diplomat to the [[Armagnac (party)|Armagnac]]s in France for his brother-in-law, Henry IV. Sir John held great favor through his relation and service to Henry IV, Henry V, and Henry VI.\n\nSir John amassed a considerable fortune and a great deal of land during his lifetime.  He accomplished this through his marriage with Elizabeth, victories in tournaments, and the spoils of war. At the battle of Agincourt, Sir John captured [[Guillebert de Lannoy]], and [[Louis, Count of Vend\u00f4me]], whom he ransomed for large sums for money; and from 1429\u20131432, Henry VI granted custody of [[Charles, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]] to Sir John.  He profited greatly from the ransoms of prisoners, and used the spoils to build [[Ampthill]] Castle, Bedfordshire, and to buy Oyster Hill Manor from the [[Mayor of London]], [[William Walworth]]. Sir John also became heavily involved in the mercantile community in London.\n\nKing Henry IV made Sir John Cornwall a [[Knight of the Garter]] in 1409.  He was created Baron Fanhope and a member of the King's [[Privy Council]] on 17 July 1433, and Baron Milbroke on 30 January 1442, by King Henry VI. Sir John's titles became extinct on his death, as he left no legitimate issue.\n\n==Death==\nSir John died on 11 December 1443 at [[Ampthill]] Castle, in Bedfordshire, England.  He was buried at Blackfriars Preachers, [[Ludgate]], in [[Middlesex]], England.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=7nZ90l1_IzAC&pg=PA102&lpg=PA102&dq=John+Cornwall,+1st+Baron+Fanhope&source=bl&ots=aeN9da8N-9&sig=GenQfwTpqPuzeu6BXMf_CLToztM&hl=ru&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi299Ta68bZAhUHFiwKHUJ9DM8Q6AEIkQEwEw#v=onepage&q=John%20Cornwall%2C%201st%20Baron%20Fanhope&f=false|title= Britain's Royal Families: The Complete Genealogy]</ref>\n\nAfter his death, Ampthill Castle became royal property.
