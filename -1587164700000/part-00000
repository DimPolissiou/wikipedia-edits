The general landing area for ''Curiosity'' on the northwestern crater floor, named [[Aeolis Palus]], is circled. (HRSC data)]]\nGale, named for [[Walter Frederick Gale|Walter F. Gale]] (1865-1945), an amateur astronomer from Australia, spans {{convert|154|km|mi|abbr=on}} in diameter and holds a mountain, Aeolis Mons (informally named \"Mount Sharp\" to pay tribute to geologist [[Robert P. Sharp]]) rising {{convert|18000|ft|m|abbr=on}} from the crater floor, higher than [[Mount Rainier]] rises above Seattle. Gale is roughly the size of Connecticut and Rhode Island.\n\nThe crater formed when an [[asteroid]] or [[comet]] hit Mars in its early history, about 3.5 to 3.8 billion years ago. The [[Impact_event|impactor]] punched a hole in the terrain, and the subsequent explosion ejected rocks and soil that landed around the crater. Layering in the central mound (Aeolis Mons) suggests it is the surviving remnant of an extensive sequence of deposits. Some scientists believe the crater filled in with sediments and, over time, the relentless Martian winds carved Aeolis Mons, which today rises about {{convert|5.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} above the floor of Gale\u2014three times higher than the Grand Canyon is deep.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jet Propulsion Laboratory |url=http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/mission/timeline/prelaunch/landingsiteselection/aboutgalecrater/ |title=Mars Science Laboratory: Curiosity's Landing Site: Gale Crater |publisher= NASA |accessdate=2012-08-18}}</ref>\n\nAt 10:32&nbsp;p.m. PDT on Aug. 5, 2012 (1:32&nbsp;a.m. EDT on Aug. 6, 2012), the Mars Science Laboratory rover ''Curiosity'' landed on Mars at {{Coord|4.5|S|137.4|E|globe:Mars}}, at the foot of the layered mountain inside Gale. ''Curiosity'' landed within a landing ellipse approximately {{convert|7|km|mi|abbr=on}} by {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}}. The landing ellipse is about {{convert|4400|m|ft|abbr=on}} below Martian \"sea level\" (defined as the average elevation around the equator). The expected near-surface atmospheric temperatures at the landing site during ''Curiosity''{{'}}s primary mission (1 Martian year or 687 Earth days) are from {{convert|-90|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} to {{convert|0|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}.\n\nScientists chose Gale as the landing site for ''Curiosity'' because it has many signs that water was present over its history. The crater's geology is notable for containing both clays and sulfate minerals, which form in water under different conditions and may also preserve signs of past life. The history of water at Gale, as recorded in its rocks, is giving ''Curiosity'' lots of clues to study as it pieces together whether Mars ever could have been a habitat for microbes. Gale contains a number of fans and deltas that provide information about lake levels in the past, including: Pancake Delta, Western Delta, Farah Vallis delta and the  Peace Vallis Fan.<ref>{{Cite report |last1=Dietrich |first1=W.

[[Formation (geology)|Formations]] within the Bradbury Group include the Yellowknife and Kimberley, while the Murray Formation is at the base of the Mount Sharp Group.

Gale]] (1865-1945), an amateur astronomer from Australia, spans {{convert|154|km|mi|abbr=on}} in diameter and holds a mountain, Aeolis Mons (informally named \"Mount Sharp\" to pay tribute to geologist [[Robert P. Sharp]]) rising {{convert|18000|ft|m|abbr=on}} from the crater floor, higher than [[Mount Rainier]] rises above Seattle. Gale is roughly the size of Connecticut and Rhode Island.\n\nThe crater formed when an [[asteroid]] or a [[comet]] hit Mars in its early history, about 3.5 to 3.8 billion years ago. The impactor punched a hole in the terrain, and the subsequent explosion ejected rocks and soil that landed around the crater. Layering in the central mound (Aeolis Mons) suggests it is the surviving remnant of an extensive sequence of deposits. Some scientists believe the crater filled in with sediments and, over time, the relentless Martian winds carved Aeolis Mons, which today rises about {{convert|5.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} above the floor of Gale\u2014three times higher than the Grand Canyon is deep.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jet Propulsion Laboratory |url=http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/mission/timeline/prelaunch/landingsiteselection/aboutgalecrater/ |title=Mars Science Laboratory: Curiosity's Landing Site: Gale Crater |publisher= NASA |accessdate=2012-08-18}}</ref>\n\nAt 10:32&nbsp;p.m. PDT on Aug. 5, 2012 (1:32&nbsp;a.m. EDT on Aug. 6, 2012), the Mars Science Laboratory rover ''Curiosity'' landed on Mars at {{Coord|4.5|S|137.4|E|globe:Mars}}, at the foot of the layered mountain inside Gale. ''Curiosity'' landed within a landing ellipse approximately {{convert|7|km|mi|abbr=on}} by {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}}. The landing ellipse is about {{convert|4400|m|ft|abbr=on}} below Martian \"sea level\" (defined as the average elevation around the equator). The expected near-surface atmospheric temperatures at the landing site during ''Curiosity''{{'}}s primary mission (1 Martian year or 687 Earth days) are from {{convert|-90|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} to {{convert|0|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}.\n\nScientists chose Gale as the landing site for ''Curiosity'' because it has many signs that water was present over its history. The crater's geology is notable for containing both clays and sulfate minerals, which form in water under different conditions and may also preserve signs of past life. The history of water at Gale, as recorded in its rocks, is giving ''Curiosity'' lots of clues to study as it pieces together whether Mars ever could have been a habitat for microbes. Gale contains a number of fans and deltas that provide information about lake levels in the past, including: Pancake Delta, Western Delta, Farah Vallis delta and the  Peace Vallis Fan.<ref>{{Cite report |last1=Dietrich |first1=W.

In 1567, [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary\u2019s]] short period of personal rule ended in recrimination, intrigue and disaster when, after her capture at [[battle of Carberry Hill|Carberry Hill]], she was forced to [[Act Anent the demission of the Crown in favour of our Sovereign Lord, and his Majesty's Coronation 1567|abdicate]] in favour of [[James VI]], her infant son.  Mary was imprisoned in [[Loch Leven Castle]], while her Protestant half-brother, [[James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray|James Stewart, Earl of Moray]] was appointed [[Regent]] on behalf of his nephew.  In early May 1568 Mary escaped, heading west to the country of the Hamiltons, high among her remaining supporters, and the safety of [[Dumbarton Castle]] with the determination to restore her rights as queen. Mary was defeated and went into exile and captivity in England. The battle can be regarded as the start of the [[Marian civil war]].\n\n==Queen's Men==\nMary's abdication had not been universally popular, even among sections of the Protestant nobility, and news of her escape were widely welcomed.  With an escort of fifty horse led by [[Claud Hamilton, 1st Lord Paisley|Lord Claud Hamilton]] she arrived in [[Lanarkshire]], soon to be joined by a wide cross-section of the nobility, including the Earls of [[Archibald Campbell, 5th Earl of Argyll|Argyll]], [[Gilbert Kennedy, 4th Earl of Cassilis|Cassillis]], [[Andrew Leslie, 5th Earl of Rothes|Rothes]] and [[Earl of Eglinton|Eglinton]], the Lords [[Lord Somerville|Sommerville]], [[Lord Hay of Yester|Yester]], [[Lord Livingston|Livingston]], [[Lord Herries of Terregles|Herries]], [[Lord Fleming|Fleming]], [[James Ross, 4th Lord Ross|Ross]], numerous of the feudal barons and their followers.  Within a few days Mary had managed to gather a respectable force of some 6000 men.\n\nIt was openly declared that her abdication, and her consent to the coronation of James, had been extorted from her under threat of death.  An act of council was then passed, declaring the whole process by which Moray had been appointed as Regent to be [[treason]]able.  A [[Contract|bond]] was drawn up by those present for her restitution, signed by eight earls, nine bishops, eighteen lords, twelve abbots and nearly one hundred barons.\n\n==Mary's march==\nIt was Mary's intention to avoid battle if possible, retiring instead to [[Dumbarton Castle]], still held for her by [[John Fleming, 5th Lord Fleming]]. Here she would be in a virtually impregnable position, well placed to receive the expected reinforcements from the north, and then recover her hold over the country by degrees. With the intention of by-passing Moray she marched to [[Rutherglen castle]] meeting loyal supporters and then on a wide circuit past Glasgow, intending to move by way of [[Langside]], [[Crookston, Glasgow|Crookston]] and [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]] back towards the [[River Clyde]], and then on to Dumbarton on the north side of the Clyde estuary. Moray drew up his army on the moor close to the village of Langside, then several miles south of Glasgow but now well within the city. [[William Kirkcaldy of Grange|Kirkcaldy]], keeping an eye on the enemy movements, noted that they were keeping to the south of the River Cart, the Regent's army being on the opposite bank. In response he ordered hackbutters ([[musketeer]]s) to mount behind each of his horsemen, rapidly fording the river, and placing them among the cottages, hedges and gardens of the village, which bordered each side of a narrow lane, through which Mary's army must [[defile (geography)|defile]]. Meanwhile Moray continued to deploy the rest of the army, the [[Vanguard (military tactics)|vanguard]] under the command of the [[James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton|Earl of Morton]] leading the march across a nearby bridge. The whole army then deployed the right around the village. No sooner was this complete than the Queen's vanguard, commanded by Lord Hamilton, began its advance through the village. The battle was now under way.\n\n==Guns and pikes==\nMary's army was commanded by Argyll, who was to show little in the way of real military skill, seemingly hoping simply to push Moray aside by sheer force of numbers: it is even suggested in the sources that he fainted at one point, though this is almost certainly a rumour spread by his enemies.  With her army now engaged the Queen stood some distance to the rear, close to Cathcart Castle on a mound since named as the Court Knowe.  As Hamilton attempted to force a passage through Langside he was met by close fire from Grange's hackbutters.  Many in the front ranks were killed, throwing the remainder back on those following, and adding to the general confusion.  Hamilton pushed on, finally reaching the top of a hill, only to find the main enemy army drawn up in good order. Morton with the border pikemen advanced to intercept Mary's vanguard.  Both sides now met in '[[push of pike]]'.  The forest of inter-locked spears was now so thick it is said that if those behind threw their discharged pistols at the enemy the weapons simply rested on the shafts as on a carpet, rather than falling to the ground.\n\nGrange, whom Moray had allowed considerable leeway, continued to act with courage and distinction; \"...&nbsp;the Regent committed unto the laird of Grange, the special care, as an experienced captain, to oversee every danger, to ride to every wing and encourage and make help where the greatest height was.\"   The battle was now at its height and the outcome still doubtful, until Grange saw that the right wing of the Regent's army-consisting of the barons of [[Renfrewshire]]-was beginning to lose ground.  He immediately galloped to the main battalion and brought reinforcements.  This was done so effectively, and the counter-attack pressed with such force, that it broke the enemy ranks.  Moray, who hitherto had stood on the defensive, repulsing Mary's cavalry, now charged at the main enemy battalion, the fight now joined all along the line.  The Queen's men crumbled, the fugitives being closely pursued by a party of Highlanders.  The Battle of Langside, which had lasted for some forty-five minutes, was over.\n\n==Aftermath==\nMary's biographer, [[Antonia Fraser]], describes the Battle of Langside a \"colossal defeat\" for Mary.<ref>Fraser, Antonia, ''Mary Queen of Scots'', Orion, London, 1969</ref> Only one of Moray's men was killed, whereas over 100 of Mary's men were lost,<ref>Fraser, Antonia, ''Mary Queen of Scots'', Orion, London, 1969</ref> a figure that almost certainly would have been much higher but for Moray's decision to avoid further bloodshed by ordering a halt to the pursuit.

From here she left for England, never to see Scotland again.\n\nMary crossed the [[Solway Firth]] to [[Workington]] on 16 May 1568 at night with twenty companions. This unexpected event provoked a dispute amongst the English border officials. On the next day she moved to [[Cockermouth]] and was greeted by Richard Lowther, the deputy of [[Henry Scrope, 9th Baron Scrope of Bolton|Lord Scrope]] at [[Carlisle Castle]]. Lowther escorted Mary to [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] on 18 May. Meanwhile, the [[Thomas Percy, 7th Earl of Northumberland|Earl of Northumberland]] who was at [[Topcliffe, North Yorkshire|Topcliffe]] heard the news from Workington, which was in his jurisdiction. The Earl obtained a letter of authority from the Council of the North at York to be the Scottish Queen's host and to \"let none of them escape.\" When the Earl arrived at Carlisle on 22 May, Richard Lowther defied him, and the Vice-Chamberlain of England, [[Francis Knollys (the elder)|Francis Knollys]], upheld Lowther's actions.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 2 (1900), pp. 408-413</ref>\n\nOver the next five years Mary's supporters in Scotland continued a [[Marian civil war|civil war]] with the Regents of Scotland.\n\n==Queen and King's men==\nA contemporary list of leading supporters on both sides at the battle survives.<ref>''Calendar of State Papers Scotland'', vol. 2 (1900), p. 405, no. 653.</ref><br />'''For the Queen''':\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Earl of Argyll]]\n* [[Earl of Eglinton]]\n* [[Gilbert Kennedy, 4th Earl of Cassilis|Earl of Cassillis]]\n* [[Andrew Leslie, 5th Earl of Rothes|Earl of Rothes]]\n* [[George Seton, 7th Lord Seton|Lord Seton]]\n* [[Robert Seton, 1st Earl of Winton|Master of Seton]]\n* [[Lord Herries]]\n* [[Robert Boyd, 5th Lord Boyd|Lord Boyd]]\n* [[Lord Hay of Yester]]\n* [[Lord Ross]]\n* [[James Somerville, 6th Lord Somerville|Lord Somerville]]\n* [[Claud Hamilton, 1st Lord Paisley|Lord Claude Hamilton]]\n* Sir James Hamilton & the [[Clan Hamilton|Hamilton name]]\n}}\n'''For Regent Moray and the King''':\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton|Earl of Morton]]\n* [[Alexander Cunningham, 5th Earl of Glencairn|Earl of Glencairn]]\n* [[Earl of Menteith]]\n* [[Alexander Home, 5th Lord Home|Lord Home]]\n* [[Patrick Lindsay, 6th Lord Lindsay|Lord Lindsay]]\n* [[Andrew Stewart, 2nd Lord Ochiltree|Lord Ochiltree]]\n* [[William Ruthven, 1st Earl of Gowrie|Lord Ruthven]]\n* Laird of Trawick (sic), John Stewart of [[Traquair]]\n* [[James Douglas, 7th Baron Drumlanrig|Laird of Drumlanrig]]\n* [[William Maitland of Lethington|Lord Secretary Maitland]]\n* [[Duke of Atholl|William Murray of Tullibardine]], Lord Comptroller\n* [[Robert Pitcairn (commendator)|Robert Pitcairn]], [[Abbot of Dunfermline]]\n* John Hay, [[Abbot of Balmerino]],\n* [[Robert Richardson (Lord Treasurer)|Robert Richardson]], [[Lord High Treasurer of Scotland|Lord High Treasurer]],\n* [[James Balfour, Lord Pittendreich|Sir James Balfour]], Justice Clerk\n* [[James MacGill of Nether Rankeillour]]\n* Laird of [[Balgonie Castle|Balgany]]\n* Laird of [[Glengarnock]]\n* [[Clan MacFarlane|Andrew MacFarlane - 14th Lord of Arrochar, 11th Chief of Clan MacFarlane (with Approx 100 Clansmen)]]\n}}\nFrom this list and other evidence, [[Gordon Donaldson]] analysed the allegiances of Scottish families during the 16th century to the cause of Mary, to English or French policy, and to the [[Scottish Reformation]], in his ''All the Queen's Men'' (1983).\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Bain, Joseph, ''Calendar of Scottish Papers 1563-1569'', Edinburgh, 1900.\n* [[Antonia Fraser|Fraser, Antonia]], ''Mary Queen of Scots''Orion, London, 1969.\n* Melville, Sir James, ''Memoirs of His Own Life, 1549-1593'', 1827.\n* [[Patrick Fraser Tytler|Tytler, Patrick Fraser]] ''The History of Scotland'', vol.

After Mexico declared independence from Spain, the area officially became part of the Mexican territory and Mexicans were actively involved in Utah while making no threat to Ute claims on the land. This continued uninterrupted until 1847 and the arrival of the Mormons, followed by the United States annexation of the territory of Utah with the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848.<ref name=\":2\" />\n[[File:Santaclaravolcano.jpg|thumb|Santa Clara Volcano]]\n\n==== Current Spanish place names ====\n[[File:Alta - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Alta]]\n[[San Juan County, Utah|San Juan County]] ( St John in Spanish), Escalante (Spanish surname), Santa Clara (Saint Clare de Assisi), Alta (high in Spanish), Pintura (painting in Spanish), Santa Clara Volcano, Callao Ghost Town (named for a town in Peru), Santa Clara River. \n\n==== Latin American Immigration to Utah ====\nIn 1900 the United States Census listed only forty individuals of Mexican nativity living in Utah.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Solorzano|first=A|date=2010|title=Community and Ethnicity: Hispanic Women in Utah's Carbon County|url=|journal=Utah Historical Quarterly|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> By 1980, the official count placed Hispanics at 4.1 percent of the population of the state, or 69.260 individuals.<ref name=\":1\" /> Spanish-speaking families began to establish homes in [[Monticello, Utah|Monticello]], find employment at Bingham Copper Mine in the Salt Lake Valley, work in the Carbon County coal mines, and find their place in other locations in Utah as new economic opportunities emerged with World War I.
