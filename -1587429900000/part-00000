It is produced by [[Bhushan Kumar]], [[Krishan Kumar (actor)|Krishan Kumar]] and Lizelle D'Souza under the banners [[T-Series (company)|T-Series]] and Remo D'Souza Entertainment. The film stars [[Varun Dhawan]], [[Shraddha Kapoor]], [[Prabhu Deva]] and [[Nora Fatehi]]. Its music is composed by [[Sachin\u2013Jigar]], [[Tanishk Bagchi]], [[Badshah (rapper)|Badshah]], [[Guru Randhawa]], Gurinder Seagal and Harsh Upadhyay, and released under the banner T-Series. The story explores a dance competition between some [[Indian people|Indian]] and [[Pakistani]] dancers.\n\nOriginally planned as a sequel to Disney's ''[[ABCD 2]]'' (2015), the film was taken off the title due to Disney's exit from Indian film production, and was instead renamed to its current title after Bhushan Kumar took over as producer. Filming commenced in February 2019 in [[Punjab]], later moved to [[London]] and was wrapped up in July 2019. It was theatrically released in India on 24 January 2020.\n\n==Plot==\nInder Singh Narula ([[Punit Pathak]]) is a dancer who is part of a [https://blog.biographypro.xyz/2020/04/street-dancer-3d-movie-review-3-review.html dance] team named Street Dancer. Inder is dancing at the Ground Zero Battle with his brother Sahej Singh Narula ([[Varun Dhawan]]) cheering for him and while doing a flip stunt, he lands on his leg and injures it. After two years, he is healing, but cannot dance. Sahej forms Street Dancer again and converts it into a studio through money whose sources he is hesitant about revealing. Poddy ([[Raghav Juyal]]), is one of Sahej's close friends, along with D ([[Dharmesh Yelande]]) and Sushi (Sushant Pujari), who are all part of Street Dancer. While showing the dance studio to the Street Dancer team, they run into Inayat ([[Shraddha Kapoor]]) and her team, the Rule Breakers, dance as well. Sahej and Inayat have always been at standstills against each other and they have a dance battle. The Rule Breakers beat Street Dancer, embarrassing Sahej in the process. Inayat's cousin, Zain ([[Salman Yusuff Khan]]), takes her home. Their family is very orthodox and Inayat lies about her dancing, hiding the truth from them. \n\nSahej visits the Royals, an all time, record-holding dance group that always wins the Ground Zero Competition. His girlfriend, Mia ([[Nora Fatehi]]) is on the team, and she is an incredible dancer. They discuss on how irritated Sahej is by Inayat, and she calms him down. Mia trains the Street Dancer gang, giving them the spark they wanted. The two gangs meet up in a restaurant for a cricket match between India (Sahej's team) and Pakistan (Inayat's team). India wins and this leads to a dance battle where Mia shows her moves. The police and the restaurant manager, Ram Prasad a.k.a. Anna ([[Prabhu Deva]]) control the fight. As they leave, Inayat sees some homeless people entering the restaurant from the back door. She follows them and meets Ram. He explains to her that these are illegal immigrants, and he feeds them food that isn't used. He takes her to an area where many illegal immigrants reside. He tells her that they can't go back to their home as they have no money. She gets emotional and begins to help them.\n\nOne day when Poddy reaches the dance studio, he sees Sahej being interrogated by the cop. Sahej reveals that when he went to India for his cousin's marriage, he met Amrinder Mehrotra ([[Aparshakti Khurana]]) and his three other friends playing drum in the marriage. He was impressed by their talent. They request Sahej to take them to London which he denies. After they offer a huge amount of 40 lakhs he agrees to take them to London. That's how he got the money to buy the dance studio. Poddy promises to not tell it to anyone.\n\nThe Ground Zero Battle returns. Inder asks Sahej to participate and win it. Inayat decides to participate so that they can use the money to help the illegal immigrants and Ram supports her. The two gangs meet and Ram says that if they become one they can easily win the competition. But both of them deny the offer. Sahej impresses the Royals with his dance at a nightclub. He, D, Poddy and Sushi are selected for the Royals. The two gangs meet in the restaurant again. They have an argument, which ends up with Ram dancing, showcasing his ability to Sahej. Sahej, blinded by his ego, turns down the opportunity. Poddy is in a relationship with Alisha, a girl from Inayat's gang. He realises that Inayat's gang are participating in the Ground Zero Battle so that they can retrieve them the prize money  which is a hundred thousand pounds to help illegal immigrants and tells Sahej about it at the Royals dance studio. Sahej does not believe Poddy and a fight ensues between the both of them. This causes Poddy to leave the Royals and he decides to join the Rule Breakers. Inayat accepts Poddy into the team and other members of the Street Dancer team also feel left out as Sahej spends his time with the Royals. \n\nThe first round of the competition is easily surpassed by both the Royals and the Rule Breakers. As Sahej, D and Shushi gets into a bus, they run into Amrinder. Amrinder tells Sahej that after he dropped them off, they went to a hostel. Over there, all illegal immigrants were staying and they were chased by the police. Leaving his identity as a Sikh and his passport, he and the three Punjabi drummers joined the homeless people. Inayat's gang were dancing to help them. He asks Sahej for help but he leaves saying he does not know him.\n\nBoth teams surpass the quarter finals and enter into semi finals. Later, the Royals and Sahej are walking in London. They run into the drummers where the leader of the Royals accidentally breaks his drums. After seeing them, Sahej feels guilty of his deeds. In the semi final round, Sahej leaves the Royals and helps Inayat's gang win the round. He then quits the Royals, breaking Mia\u2019s heart, and forms Street Dancer again.\n\nMany practices occur, and then Inayat's family finds out about her dancing actions. They ban her from dancing, shocking the team. Sahej and Zain go to her house, and convince her family to let her dance. A relationship blossoms between Sahej and Inayat as they prepare for the final round of the Ground Zero Battle. The Royals perform and amazes the crowd. Street Dancer performs and in the middle of their dance, a member of the Royals take off the music. The host tells them that if there is no music, they cannot dance. Amrinder then uses his drums with his friends to make music for them to dance to. The leader of the Royals finds out that his team member took off the music and he asks to puts it back in, since he did not want to cheat. At the end of their dance, Sahej does the flip stunt, which got his brother injured, flawlessly. Making his brother and his country proud, Sahej gets Street Dancer to defeat the Royals and wins the competition, also earning the Royals\u2019 respect. In the end, Sahej and Inayat begin a friendship as they help the immigrants.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Varun Dhawan]] as Sahej Singh Narula, an aspiring dancer who follows his brother's footsteps.

It is produced by [[Bhushan Kumar]], [[Krishan Kumar (actor)|Krishan Kumar]] and Lizelle D'Souza under the banners [[T-Series (company)|T-Series]] and Remo D'Souza Entertainment.

Its music is composed by [[Sachin\u2013Jigar]], [[Tanishk Bagchi]], [[Badshah (rapper)|Badshah]], [[Guru Randhawa]], Gurinder Seagal and Harsh Upadhyay, and released under the banner T-Series. The story explores a dance competition between some [[Indian people|Indian]] and [[Pakistani]] dancers.\n\nOriginally planned as a sequel to Disney's ''[[ABCD 2]]'' (2015), the film was taken off the title due to Disney's exit from Indian film production, and was instead renamed to its current title after Bhushan Kumar took over as producer. Filming commenced in February 2019 in [[Punjab]], later moved to [[London]] and was wrapped up in July 2019. It was theatrically released in India on 24 January 2020.\n\n==Plot==\nInder Singh Narula ([[Punit Pathak]]) is a dancer who is part of a dance team named Street Dancer. Inder is dancing at the Ground Zero Battle with his brother Sahej Singh Narula ([[Varun Dhawan]]) cheering for him and while doing a flip stunt, he lands on his leg and injures it. After two years, he is healing, but cannot dance. Sahej forms Street Dancer again and converts it into a studio through money whose sources he is hesitant about revealing. Poddy ([[Raghav Juyal]]), is one of Sahej's close friends, along with D ([[Dharmesh Yelande]]) and Sushi (Sushant Pujari), who are all part of Street Dancer. While showing the dance studio to the Street Dancer team, they run into Inayat ([[Shraddha Kapoor]]) and her team, the Rule Breakers, dance as well. Sahej and Inayat have always been at standstills against each other and they have a dance battle. The Rule Breakers beat Street Dancer, embarrassing Sahej in the process. Inayat's cousin, Zain ([[Salman Yusuff Khan]]), takes her home. Their family is very orthodox and Inayat lies about her dancing, hiding the truth from them. \n\nSahej visits the Royals, an all time, record-holding dance group that always wins the Ground Zero Competition. His girlfriend, Mia ([[Nora Fatehi]]) is on the team, and she is an incredible dancer. They discuss on how irritated Sahej is by Inayat, and she calms him down. Mia trains the Street Dancer gang, giving them the spark they wanted. The two gangs meet up in a restaurant for a cricket match between India (Sahej's team) and Pakistan (Inayat's team). India wins and this leads to a dance battle where Mia shows her moves. The police and the restaurant manager, Ram Prasad a.k.a. Anna ([[Prabhu Deva]]) control the fight. As they leave, Inayat sees some homeless people entering the restaurant from the back door. She follows them and meets Ram. He explains to her that these are illegal immigrants, and he feeds them food that isn't used. He takes her to an area where many illegal immigrants reside. He tells her that they can't go back to their home as they have no money. She gets emotional and begins to help them.\n\nOne day when Poddy reaches the dance studio, he sees Sahej being interrogated by the cop. Sahej reveals that when he went to India for his cousin's marriage, he met Amrinder Mehrotra ([[Aparshakti Khurana]]) and his three other friends playing drum in the marriage. He was impressed by their talent. They request Sahej to take them to London which he denies. After they offer a huge amount of 40 lakhs he agrees to take them to London. That's how he got the money to buy the dance studio. Poddy promises to not tell it to anyone.\n\nThe Ground Zero Battle returns. Inder asks Sahej to participate and win it. Inayat decides to participate so that they can use the money to help the illegal immigrants and Ram supports her. The two gangs meet and Ram says that if they become one they can easily win the competition. But both of them deny the offer. Sahej impresses the Royals with his dance at a nightclub. He, D, Poddy and Sushi are selected for the Royals. The two gangs meet in the restaurant again. They have an argument, which ends up with Ram dancing, showcasing his ability to Sahej. Sahej, blinded by his ego, turns down the opportunity. Poddy is in a relationship with Alisha, a girl from Inayat's gang. He realises that Inayat's gang are participating in the Ground Zero Battle so that they can retrieve them the prize money  which is a hundred thousand pounds to help illegal immigrants and tells Sahej about it at the Royals dance studio. Sahej does not believe Poddy and a fight ensues between the both of them. This causes Poddy to leave the Royals and he decides to join the Rule Breakers. Inayat accepts Poddy into the team and other members of the Street Dancer team also feel left out as Sahej spends his time with the Royals. \n\nThe first round of the competition is easily surpassed by both the Royals and the Rule Breakers. As Sahej, D and Shushi gets into a bus, they run into Amrinder. Amrinder tells Sahej that after he dropped them off, they went to a hostel. Over there, all illegal immigrants were staying and they were chased by the police. Leaving his identity as a Sikh and his passport, he and the three Punjabi drummers joined the homeless people. Inayat's gang were dancing to help them. He asks Sahej for help but he leaves saying he does not know him.\n\nBoth teams surpass the quarter finals and enter into semi finals. Later, the Royals and Sahej are walking in London. They run into the drummers where the leader of the Royals accidentally breaks his drums. After seeing them, Sahej feels guilty of his deeds. In the semi final round, Sahej leaves the Royals and helps Inayat's gang win the round. He then quits the Royals, breaking Mia\u2019s heart, and forms Street Dancer again.\n\nMany practices occur, and then Inayat's family finds out about her dancing actions. They ban her from dancing, shocking the team. Sahej and Zain go to her house, and convince her family to let her dance. A relationship blossoms between Sahej and Inayat as they prepare for the final round of the Ground Zero Battle. The Royals perform and amazes the crowd. Street Dancer performs and in the middle of their dance, a member of the Royals take off the music. The host tells them that if there is no music, they cannot dance. Amrinder then uses his drums with his friends to make music for them to dance to. The leader of the Royals finds out that his team member took off the music and he asks to puts it back in, since he did not want to cheat. At the end of their dance, Sahej does the flip stunt, which got his brother injured, flawlessly. Making his brother and his country proud, Sahej gets Street Dancer to defeat the Royals and wins the competition, also earning the Royals\u2019 respect. In the end, Sahej and Inayat begin a friendship as they help the immigrants.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Varun Dhawan]] as Sahej Singh Narula, an aspiring dancer who follows his brother's footsteps.

{"title_page": "Numbers game", "text_new": "{{about||the US TV series|The Numbers Game}}\n{{hatnote|\"Cut number\" redirects here; \"cut number\" also refers to the codes used to identify [[list of pasta|pasta varieties]].}}\n\nThe '''numbers game''', also known as the '''numbers racket''', the '''Italian lottery''', or the '''daily number''', is a form of [[illegal gambling]] or illegal [[lottery]] played mostly in poor and [[working class]] neighborhoods in the [[United States]], wherein a bettor attempts to pick three digits to match those that will be randomly drawn the following day. For many years the \"number\" has been the last three digits of \"the handle\", the amount [[Sports betting|race track bettors]] placed on [[horse race|race day]] at a major [[racetrack]], published in racing journals and major newspapers in New York. \n\n[[Gambler]]s place bets with a [[bookmaker]] (\"bookie\") at a [[tavern]], [[bar]], [[barber|barber shop]], [[social club]], or any other semi-private place that acts as an illegal betting parlor. [[Bagman|Runner]]s carry the money and betting slips between the betting parlors and the headquarters, called a numbers bank.\n\nClosely related is policy, known as the '''policy racket''', or the '''policy game'''. The name \"policy\" is based on the similarity to cheap insurance, which is also a gamble on the future.<ref>{{cite book|author=Sifakis, Carl|title=The Mafia Encyclopedia|publisher= Facts on File|date= 2005|page=336}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\"Policy shops\", where bettors choose numbers, operated in the [[United States]] prior to 1860.<ref>{{cite book |author=Thompson, Nathan  |title=Kings: The True Story of Chicago's Policy Kings and Numbers Racketeers, An Informal History |year= |publisher= |page= |quote= | url=http://www.policykings.com/|isbn= }}</ref> In 1875, a report of a select committee of the [[New York State Assembly]] stated that \"the lowest, meanest, worst form ...

It was known in [[Cuban-American]] communities as ''[[bolita]]'' (\"little ball\").{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nOther sources date the origin of Policy, at least in its most well-known form, to 1885 in Chicago. During part of its run from 1868 to 1892, the [[Louisiana State Lottery Company|Louisiana Lottery]] involved drawing several numbers from 1 to 78, and people wagering would choose their own numbers on which to place a bet. Initially, it instead ran by means of the sale of serially-numbered tickets, and at another point, the numbers drawn ran from 1 to 75.\n\nBy the early 20th century, the game was associated with poor and working-class communities, as it could be played for as little as a penny. Also, unlike state lotteries, bookies could extend [[Credit (finance)|credit]] to the bettors and policy winners could avoid paying [[income tax]]. Different policy banks would offer different rates, although a payoff of 600 to 1 was typical.<ref>{{cite news|title=600 to 1 Odds Lure Harlem to Gambling Orgy.

This resulted in the numbers game's taking off in [[Boston]]. According to [[Howie Carr]], ''[[Boston Herald#The Boston American|The Boston American]]'' was able to stay in business in part because it published the daily number.<ref name=\"Carr\" /> \n\nDuring the 1950s, Wimpy and Walter Bennett ran a numbers ring in Boston's [[Roxbury, Boston|Roxbury]] neighborhood. The Bennetts' prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [[Stephen Flemmi]] took and collected bets for them. \n\nAround the same time, [[James McLean (mobster)|Buddy McLean]] began forming a gang in [[Somerville, Massachusetts]] to, among other criminal activities, run numbers. This would become the [[Winter Hill Gang]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Songini|first1=Marc|title=Boston Mob: The Rise and Fall of the New England Mob and Its Most Notorious Killer|date=2014|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-312-37363-4}}</ref> By the 1970s, the Winter Hill Gang, then led by [[Whitey Bulger]], moved bookies under its protection away from the numbers game to sports betting, as the state was starting its own lottery, and the [[National Football League]] did not allow betting on its games outside of Nevada; thereby Massachusetts could not compete with them. Despite the creation of the state lottery, however, the numbers game's demise in Massachusetts was not immediate, as the state lottery had a lower payout and was taxed.<ref name=\"Carr\" />\n\n===Chicago===\nIn the 1940s, Eddie Jones and his brothers earned more than $180,000 per week in the black community. While in jail for income tax evasion, Jones became acquainted with [[Sam Giancana]], a hit-man for hire among top [[Italian-American Mafia|Italian Mafia]] figures. Back on the streets, the men became friends. Eddie taught Sam everything he knew about the policy game and how to memorize number combinations, and even hired Sam to operate one of his many lucrative establishments. \n\nSam made his first fortune through Eddie. Aspiring to become a \"[[made man]]\", Sam shared his new knowledge of the policy game with the [[American Mafia#Structure|Dons]], who were impressed. By then, the Italian Mafia focused their attention on the Jones market in the black community. \n\nUnder orders from the Dons, Sam was instructed to remove Jones from his lucrative position and take over. To avoid being murdered by the mob, Jones walked away from his family enterprise.<ref>LTV021. (2014, December, 26). Momo: The Sam Giancana Story (2014) - USA (Documentary) - Full HD [Video]. Retrieved from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgvDMwtJZTk</ref>\n\n===Detroit===\nA 1941 trial exposed Detroit's extensive numbers operations. Among the policy houses operating were \"Big Four Mutuale\" (owned by John Roxborough, boxer [[Joe Louis]]'s manager), \"Yellow Dog\" (owned by Everett Watson), \"Tia Juana\", \"Interstate\", \"Mexico and Villa\" (operated by Louis Weisberg), \"New York\", \"Michigan\", and others.<ref>\"Detroit Racket Probe Witness Names Police as Takers\", ''Cleveland Call and Post'', Nov. 15, 1941, p. 11-B.</ref> Big Four was said in testimony to be doing $800,000 business a year, with profits of up to $6000 a week.  Yellow Dog was said to be doing $4,900 daily in business, totaling $1.5 million a year.  The grand jury in the trial of 71 defendants charged that 10 policy houses had been paying $600 a month in payoffs equally divided between the chief of police, the head prosecutor and the mayor, with smaller bribes in the $25 to $50 range going to individual police sergeants and lieutenants. Former mayor [[Richard Reading]] was said to have received $18,000 in payoffs. Reading, Roxborough, Watson, and several others were convicted on conspiracy charges, with Roxborough receiving a {{frac|2|1|2}}- to 5-year sentence, and Reading sentenced to four to five years.\n\n===Cleveland===\nBenny Mason, of the \"B&M\" policy house, and Buster Mathews of the \"Goldfield\" policy house, were the main kingpins of the numbers game in 1930s and 1940s Cleveland. In a 1935 raid on the B&M house on E. 46th St., police found 200 policy writers on hand who had handed in their books and were waiting for the payoff.<ref>\"Benny Mason Follows Policy Money to Police Station to Count It\", ''Cleveland Call and Post'', March 16, 1935, p. 1.</ref> In a 1949 arrest, police picked up a 35-year-old woman named Robinson who told them she had been a policy writer for the past month and a half, at $40 a week. She was writing slips for the Old Kentucky, Goldfield and Last Chance games, and her top sheet showed that she had written $500 in business on that day (which happened to be Good Friday) alone.<ref>\"In Good Friday Raid, Vice-Busters Strike Again\", ''Cleveland Call and Post'', April 23, 1949, p. 5.</ref>\n\nBy the 1950s, there were 8 rival numbers games operating in black sections of Cleveland, including \"California Gold\", \"Mound Bayou\" and \"T. & O.\" The winning three-digit number from 000 to 999 was determined by the closing stock market results in the evening papers, with one digit each being taken from the totals for advances, declines, and unchanged. Bets of up to $2 would be placed with hundreds of numbers writers around the city, who would keep 25% of the money bet as their fee. In the mid-afternoon a runner (locally known as the pickup man or woman) would rendezvous with the writers to collect the policy slips and cash, which would be taken to a central location and totaled on adding machines prior to determining the winners. The runners kept 10% of the money bet as their fee. 65 cents on every dollar bet would be delivered to the \"clearinghouse\" parlors, which calculated the winners and paid off at 500 to 1 odds, keeping 15 cents on the dollar, on an average day when no \"hot\" number hit, for themselves. In the evening the runner would make the rounds again to deliver the cash winnings to those writers whose customers had hit the winning number, and winners would be paid. A number of bars, private clubs and taverns around town, including the \"Tia Juana\", served as centers of the action where bettors and writers would congregate and wait for the winners to be announced.\n\nAfter a 1955 car bombing in which the girlfriend of Arthur \"Little Brother\" Drake was killed, police conducted a mass roundup of 28 numbers operators and runners on the east side, including Drake, Geech Bell, Don King, Edward Keeling, Dan Boone, Thomas Turk, and others.<ref>\"No Clues in Bomb Death: Mass Roundup of Racketeers is Big Washout\", ''Cleveland Call and Post'', Sept. 17, 1955, pg. 1.</ref> The following year Russian gangster [[Alex Birns|Shon Birns]] tried to keep the peace by setting up a 5-member syndicate of the leading black operators in Cleveland including [[Don King (boxing promoter)|Don King]], Virgil Ogletree, Boone and Keeling to control the game, insure payouts when \"hot\" numbers which had been overbet hit for large scores, and limit the payoff odds to 500 to 1; Birns also attempted to introduce a new method of determining the winning number. The game was wildly popular; in the 1950s one Cleveland numbers house was said to clear $20,000 a day.<ref>Priscilla Zotti, .

The state's rake is typically 50% rather than the 20\u201340% of the numbers game. The [[New York Lottery]] and [[Pennsylvania Lottery]] even use the names \"Numbers\" and \"Daily Number\" respectively. Despite the existence of legal alternatives, some gamblers still prefer to play with a bookie for a number of reasons. Among them are the ability to bet on credit, better payoffs, the convenience of calling in one's bet on the telephone, the ability to play if under the legal age, and the avoidance of government taxes.\n\n==Gameplay==\nOne of the problems of the early game was to find a way to [[random number generation|draw a random number]]. Initially, winning numbers were set by the daily outcome of a random drawing of numbered balls, or by spinning a \"policy wheel\", at the headquarters of the local numbers ring. The daily outcomes were publicized by being posted after the draw at the headquarters, and were often \"fixed\". The existence of rigged games, used to cheat players and drive competitors out of business, as well as the practical obstacles to holding a drawing for a lottery that is illegal, later led to the use of widely published unpredictable numbers such as the last three numbers in the published daily balance of the [[United States Treasury]], or the middle three digits of the number of shares traded that day on the [[New York Stock Exchange]].<ref name=\"Cook2014\">{{cite book|author=Kevin Cook|title=Kitty Genovese: The Murder, the Bystanders, the Crime that Changed America|date=3 March 2014|publisher=W. W. Norton & Company|isbn=978-0-393-23928-7|page=68}}</ref>\n\nThis is what led to the change from the game of policy, where 12 or 13 numbers from 1 to 78 were drawn, and players bet on combinations of four or fewer of them, to the \"numbers game\" where players chose a three-digit number to bet on.\n\nThe use of a central, independently-chosen number allowed for gamblers from a larger area to engage in the same game and it made larger wins possible. It also gave customers confidence in the fairness of the games, which could still generate vast profits even if run honestly as they paid out only around $600 for every $1000 wagered.<ref name=\"Cook2014\" />\n\nWhen the Treasury began rounding off the balance, many bookies began to use the \"mutuel\" number. This consisted of the last dollar digit of the daily total handle of the [[Across the board|Win, Place and Show bets]] at a local [[race track]], read from top to bottom. For example, if the daily handle (takings at the racetrack) was:\n* Win&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$100'''4'''.25\n* Place&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$58'''3'''.56\n* Show&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$2'''7'''.61\nthen the daily number was 437.\nBy 1936, \"The Bug\" had spread to cities such as Atlanta where the winning number was determined by the last digit of that day's New York bond sales.<ref>''Associated Press'', February 12, 1936</ref>\n\n==Policy dealers==\n* [[Albert J.

Among the policy houses operating were \"Big Four Mutuale\" (owned by John Roxborough, boxer [[Joe Louis]]'s manager), \"Yellow Dog\" (owned by Everett Watson), \"Tia Juana\", \"Interstate\", \"Mexico and Villa\" (operated by Louis Weisberg), \"New York\", \"Michigan\", and others.<ref>\"Detroit Racket Probe Witness Names Police as Takers\", ''Cleveland Call and Post'', Nov. 15, 1941, p. 11-B.</ref> Big Four was said in testimony to be doing $800,000 business a year, with profits of up to $6000 a week.  Yellow Dog was said to be doing $4,900 daily in business, totaling $1.5 million a year.  The grand jury in the trial of 71 defendants charged that 10 policy houses had been paying $600 a month in payoffs equally divided between the chief of police, the head prosecutor and the mayor, with smaller bribes in the $25 to $50 range going to individual police sergeants and lieutenants. Former mayor [[Richard Reading]] was said to have received $18,000 in payoffs. Reading, Roxborough, Watson, and several others were convicted on conspiracy charges, with Roxborough receiving a {{frac|2|1|2}}- to 5-year sentence, and Reading sentenced to four to five years.\n\n===Cleveland===\nBenny Mason, of the \"B&M\" policy house, and Buster Mathews of the \"Goldfield\" policy house, were the main kingpins of the numbers game in 1930s and 1940s Cleveland. In a 1935 raid on the B&M house on E. 46th St., police found 200 policy writers on hand who had handed in their books and were waiting for the payoff.<ref>\"Benny Mason Follows Policy Money to Police Station to Count It\", ''Cleveland Call and Post'', March 16, 1935, p. 1.</ref> In a 1949 arrest, police picked up a 35-year-old woman named Robinson who told them she had been a policy writer for the past month and a half, at $40 a week. She was writing slips for the Old Kentucky, Goldfield and Last Chance games, and her top sheet showed that she had written $500 in business on that day (which happened to be Good Friday) alone.<ref>\"In Good Friday Raid, Vice-Busters Strike Again\", ''Cleveland Call and Post'', April 23, 1949, p. 5.</ref>\n\nBy the 1950s, there were 8 rival numbers games operating in black sections of Cleveland, including \"California Gold\", \"Mound Bayou\" and \"T. & O.\" The winning three-digit number from 000 to 999 was determined by the closing stock market results in the evening papers, with one digit each being taken from the totals for advances, declines, and unchanged. Bets of up to $2 would be placed with hundreds of numbers writers around the city, who would keep 25% of the money bet as their fee. In the mid-afternoon a runner (locally known as the pickup man or woman) would rendezvous with the writers to collect the policy slips and cash, which would be taken to a central location and totaled on adding machines prior to determining the winners. The runners kept 10% of the money bet as their fee. 65 cents on every dollar bet would be delivered to the \"clearinghouse\" parlors, which calculated the winners and paid off at 500 to 1 odds, keeping 15 cents on the dollar, on an average day when no \"hot\" number hit, for themselves. In the evening the runner would make the rounds again to deliver the cash winnings to those writers whose customers had hit the winning number, and winners would be paid. A number of bars, private clubs and taverns around town, including the \"Tia Juana\", served as centers of the action where bettors and writers would congregate and wait for the winners to be announced.\n\nAfter a 1955 car bombing in which the girlfriend of Arthur \"Little Brother\" Drake was killed, police conducted a mass roundup of 28 numbers operators and runners on the east side, including Drake, Geech Bell, Don King, Edward Keeling, Dan Boone, Thomas Turk, and others.<ref>\"No Clues in Bomb Death: Mass Roundup of Racketeers is Big Washout\", ''Cleveland Call and Post'', Sept. 17, 1955, pg. 1.</ref> The following year Russian gangster [[Alex Birns|Shon Birns]] tried to keep the peace by setting up a 5-member syndicate of the leading black operators in Cleveland including [[Don King (boxing promoter)|Don King]], Virgil Ogletree, Boone and Keeling to control the game, insure payouts when \"hot\" numbers which had been overbet hit for large scores, and limit the payoff odds to 500 to 1; Birns also attempted to introduce a new method of determining the winning number. The game was wildly popular; in the 1950s one Cleveland numbers house was said to clear $20,000 a day.<ref>Priscilla Zotti, . ''Injustice for All''  (Peter Lang, 2005) pp 1-8.</ref>\n\n===Atlanta===\n\nIn Atlanta the game was known as \"playing the bug.\" In 1936 ''The Atlanta Constitution'' wrote: \"Both in the business section and the residential areas, one or more solicitors make their daily morning rounds into every office and every home.  Then, in the afternoons, the \"pay-off\" men make their rounds over the same routes.  Their patrons include every class of Atlanta citizens\u2014professional men, businessmen, housewives, and even children.\"<ref>\"Smashing of 'Bug' Racket Up to Public, Says Boykin,\" ''Atlanta Constitution'', December 18, 1936, p. 1.</ref>   \"The bug\" was believed by police to be grossing citywide as much as $30,000 in bets a day at its height in 1937\u20131938.  During a police crackdown in 1943, authorities claimed that the game was in decline and \"they are lucky if they bank as much as $12,000 to $15,000 a day,\" after a raid on an alleged headquarters on Parsons Street.<ref>\"Bug Racket at Low Ebb in Atlanta\", ''Atlanta Constitution'', April 8, 1943, p. 12.</ref> In 1944, eight bug rings were believed to be operating in the city, collectively handling a total of $15,000 to $20,000 in bets on an average day. Writers took out a 25% commission before passing on the rest of the day's receipts to the house.<ref>\"$3,000 Tickets, 5 Men Seized in Lottery Raid,\" ''Atlanta Constitution'', June 30, 1944, p. 1.</ref>\nBug writers employed a number of schemes to foil police: in 1936 police observed writers carrying the day's bet slips gathering under the bridge which passes over the railroad tracks at Nelson St.  As lottery squad officers watched, a pick-up car pulled up and stopped on the bridge overhead, the writers threw their paper sacks full of bet slips up to it, and the car sped off.<ref>\"'Bug' Men Driven to Cover of Night,\" ''Atlanta Constitution'', February 18, 1936, p. 1.</ref> In 1937 indictments were brought against the alleged \"big shots\" of the bug game in Atlanta, including Bob Hogg, the Hall brothers (Albert and Leonard), Flem King, Willie Carter, Walter Cutcliffe, Glenn House, and Henry F. Shorter.<ref>\"Ten Reputed 'Big Shots' Named in Bills Drawn for Jury in Lottery Quiz: Hogg, Cutcliffe, House and Halls Reported in List,\" ''Atlanta Constitution'', Oct. 1, 1937, p. 1.</ref> Henry Shorter was a barber who ran the game out of his barber shop.  In 1944, Shorter was one of a select group of 20 African-American community leaders who were turned away from the polls when they attempted to vote in the Democratic primary; the [[Martin Luther King Sr.|Rev. M.L.

While gambling in casinos is legal for tourists visiting the Bahamas, it is forbidden for Bahamian residents. There is also no legalized lottery for Bahamian nationals.

Ianni, in his book ''Black Mafia: Ethnic Succession in Organized Crime'' writes: \"By 1925 there were thirty black policy banks in [[Harlem]], several of them large enough to collect bets in an area of twenty city blocks and across three or four avenues.\" By 1931, big time numbers operators in Harlem included James Warner, [[Stephanie St. Clair]] (\"Madame Queen\"), [[Casper Holstein]], [[Ellsworth \"Bumpy\" Johnson]], Wilfred Brunder, Jose Miro, Joseph Ison, Masjoe Ison and Simeon Francis.<ref>[http://www.crimelibrary.com/gangsters_outlaws/gang/harlem_gangs/3.html Harlem Gangs: The Numbers Game] from [[Crime Library]]</ref> The game survived despite periodic police crackdowns.<ref>{{cite news |first= Margaret|last= Hess|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Game the Police Are Seeking to Curb Draws Victims From the City's Poor. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1934/02/25/archives/policy-odds-heavy-against-players-game-the-police-are-seeking-to.html |quote= The police offensive recently launched against the policy game has resulted in numerous arrests and the raiding of a \"bank\" in which three sacks of \"slips\" were discovered.

The state's rake is typically 50% rather than the 20\u201340% of the numbers game. The [[New York Lottery]] and [[Pennsylvania Lottery]] even use the names \"Numbers\" and \"Daily Number\" respectively. Despite the existence of legal alternatives, some gamblers still prefer to play with a bookie for a number of reasons. Among them are the ability to bet on credit, better payoffs, the convenience of calling in one's bet on the telephone, the ability to play if under the legal age, and the avoidance of government taxes.\n\n==Gameplay==\nOne of the problems of the early game was to find a way to [[random number generation|draw a random number]]. Initially, winning numbers were set by the daily outcome of a random drawing of numbered balls, or by spinning a \"policy wheel\", at the headquarters of the local numbers ring. The daily outcomes were publicized by being posted after the draw at the headquarters, and were often \"fixed\". The existence of rigged games, used to cheat players and drive competitors out of business, as well as the practical obstacles to holding a drawing for a lottery that is illegal, later led to the use of widely published unpredictable numbers such as the last three numbers in the published daily balance of the [[United States Treasury]], or the middle three digits of the number of shares traded that day on the [[New York Stock Exchange]].<ref name=\"Cook2014\">{{cite book|author=Kevin Cook|title=Kitty Genovese: The Murder, the Bystanders, the Crime that Changed America|date=3 March 2014|publisher=W. W. Norton & Company|isbn=978-0-393-23928-7|page=68}}</ref>\n\nThis is what led to the change from the game of policy, where 12 or 13 numbers from 1 to 78 were drawn, and players bet on combinations of four or fewer of them, to the \"numbers game\" where players chose a three-digit number to bet on.\n\nThe use of a central, independently-chosen number allowed for gamblers from a larger area to engage in the same game and it made larger wins possible. It also gave customers confidence in the fairness of the games, which could still generate vast profits even if run honestly as they paid out only around $600 for every $1000 wagered.<ref name=\"Cook2014\" />\n\nWhen the Treasury began rounding off the balance, many bookies began to use the \"mutuel\" number. This consisted of the last dollar digit of the daily total handle of the [[Across the board|Win, Place and Show bets]] at a local [[race track]], read from top to bottom. For example, if the daily handle (takings at the racetrack) was:\n* Win&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$100'''4'''.25\n* Place&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$58'''3'''.56\n* Show&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$2'''7'''.61\nthen the daily number was 437.\nBy 1936, \"The Bug\" had spread to cities such as Atlanta where the winning number was determined by the last digit of that day's New York bond sales.<ref>''Associated Press'', February 12, 1936</ref>\n\n==Policy dealers==\n* [[Albert J.

album, ''[[Funky Divas]]''. The single reached number two on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], becoming their joint highest-peaking single on the chart alongside \"[[Hold On (En Vogue song)|Hold On]]\" and \"[[Don't Let Go (Love)]]\", and it peaked atop the ''Billboard'' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|Hot R&B Singles]] chart for two weeks. Internationally, the song reached number four in the United Kingdom and peaked within the top 10 on the charts of Canada, Ireland and the Netherlands.\n\nThe single was certified gold in the US by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] for sales/shipments of over 500,000 units. [[VH1]] ranked it number 43 on its list for the \"100 Greatest Songs of the '90s\".\n\n==Production==\n\"My Lovin'\" contains a sample of the guitar riff from the [[James Brown]] song \"[[The Payback (song)|The Payback]]\".

This event has its roots in a comprehensive [[cavalry]] test that required mastery of several types of riding. The competition may be run as a '''one-day event''' ('''ODE'''), where all three events are completed in one day (dressage, followed by show jumping and then the cross-country phase) or a '''three-day event''' ('''3DE'''), which is more commonly now run over four days, with dressage on the first two days, followed by cross-country the next day and then show jumping in reverse order on the final day. Eventing was previously known as '''Combined Training''', and the name persists in many smaller organizations. The term \"Combined Training\" is sometimes confused with the term \"Combined Test\", which refers to a combination of just two of the phases, most commonly dressage and show jumping.\n\n==Phases==\nEventing is an equestrian [[triathlon]], in that it combines three different disciplines in one competition set out over one, two, or three days, depending on the length of courses and number of entries. This sport follows a similar format in Australia, Canada, Ireland, United Kingdom and the United States\n\n===Dressage===\n[[File:Pitt Shoulder.JPG|right|200px|thumb|[[William Fox-Pitt]] performing a [[half-pass]] in a dressage test at an event]]\n{{See also|Dressage}}\n\nThe [[dressage]] phase (held first) consists of an exact sequence of movements ridden in an enclosed arena (20\u00d760&nbsp;m for International 3DE but usually 20\u00d740&nbsp;m for ODE). The test is judged by one or more judges, who are looking for balance, rhythm, suppleness, and most importantly, the cooperation between the horse and rider. The challenge is to demonstrate that a supremely fit horse, capable of completing the cross-country phase on time, also has the training to perform in a graceful, relaxed, and precise manner. Dressage work is the basis of all the other phases and disciplines within the sport of eventing because it develops the strength and balance that allow a horse to go cross-country and show jump competently.\n\nAt the highest level of competition, the dressage test is roughly equivalent to the United States Dressage Federation Third Level and may ask for [[half-pass]] at trot, [[shoulder-in]], [[haunches-in|travers]], collected, medium and extended gaits, single [[flying change]]s, and [[counter-canter]]. The tests may ''not'' ask for [[Grand Prix Dressage|Grand Prix]] movements such as [[piaffe]], canter pirouette, or [[passage (dressage)|passage]].\n\nEach movement in the test is scored on a scale from 0 to 10, with a score of \"10\" being the highest possible mark and with the total maximum score for the test varying depending on the level of competition and the number of movements. A score of 10 is very rare. Therefore, if one movement is poorly executed, it is still possible for the rider to get a good overall score if the remaining movements are very well executed. The marks are added together and any errors of course deducted.  To convert this score to penalty points, the average marks of all judges are converted to a percentage of the maximum possible score, subtracted from 100 and the multiplied by a co-efficient decided by the governing body. Canadian example: 77 percent becomes 34.5 penalty points or (100 - 77) x 1.5 = 34.5\n* Once the bell rings the rider is allowed 45 seconds to enter the ring or receive a two-point penalty, then an additional 45 seconds, for a total of 90 seconds, or is eliminated.<ref>https://files.usef.org/assets/j7nlXQg0tg4/13ev.pdf</ref>\n* If all four feet of the horse exit the arena during the test, this results in elimination.\n* If the horse resists more than 20 seconds during the test, this results in elimination.\n* If the rider falls, this results in elimination. \n* Errors on course:\n** 1st: minus 2 marks\n** 2nd: minus 4 marks\n** 3rd: elimination\n\n===Cross-country===\n[[Image:454 Paul Sims on Sunny Boy.jpg|left|thumb|A rider on cross-country]]\nThe next phase, [[cross-country equestrianism|cross-country]], requires both horse and rider to be in excellent physical shape and to be brave and trusting of each other. This phase consists of approximately 12\u201320 fences (lower levels), or 30\u201340 at the higher levels, placed on a long outdoor circuit. These fences consist of very solidly built natural objects (logs, stone walls, etc.) as well as various obstacles such as [[water (obstacle)|ponds and streams]], ditches, [[bank (obstacle)|drops and banks]], and [[Combination (jump)|combinations]] including several jumping efforts based on objects that would commonly occur in the countryside. Sometimes, particularly at higher levels, fences are designed that would not normally occur in nature. However, these are still designed to be as solid as more natural obstacles. Safety regulations mean that some obstacles are now being built with a \"frangible pin system\", allowing part or all of the jump to collapse if hit with enough impact. Speed is also a factor, with the rider required to cross the finish line within a certain time frame (optimum time). Crossing the finish line after the optimum time results in penalties for each second over.  At lower levels, there is also a speed fault time, where penalties are incurred for horse and rider pairs completing the course too quickly. For every \"disobedience\" (refusal or run-out of a jump) a horse and rider incur on course, penalties will be added to their dressage score. After four disobediences altogether or three disobediences at one fence the pair is eliminated, meaning they can no longer participate in the competition. A horse and rider pair can also be eliminated for going off course, for example missing a fence. If the horses shoulder and hind-quarter touch the ground, mandatory retirement is taken and they are not allowed to participate further in the competition. If the rider falls off the horse they are eliminated. However, in the US this rule is currently being revised for the Novice level and below. The penalties for disobediences on cross-country are weighted severely relative to the other phases of competition to emphasize the importance of courage, endurance, and athleticism. Fitness is required as the time allowed will require a strong canter at the lower levels, all the way to a strong gallop at the higher events.\n\nIn recent years, a controversy has developed between supporters of short and long format three-day events.  Traditionally, three-day events had dressage, endurance, and show jumping. Endurance day consisted of 4 phases: A, B, C and D.  Phases A and C were roads and tracks, with A being a medium-paced warm up to prepare the horse and rider for Phase B, a steeplechase format at an extremely fast pace over steeplechase-style fences.  Phase C was a slow-paced cool down coming off of phase B, in preparation for the toughest and most demanding phase, D, or cross-country.  Before embarking on phase D, in the \"ten-minute box\", horses had to be approved to continue by a [[veterinary physician|vet]], who monitored their temperature and [[circulatory system of the horse|heart rate]], ensuring that the horse was sound and fit.\n\nThree day events are now offered in the classic format, with endurance day, or short-format, with no steeplechase (phase B) or roads and tracks (phases A and C).  The 2004 Olympic Summer Games in Athens, Greece chose the short format, due to lack of facilities, time and financing, which sparked a large debate in the eventing community whether to keep the steeplechase phase or just offer cross-country. Today, most events are run short-format. In the United States the \"classic format\" remains a popular option for the Novice, and Training levels of competition at select events.\n\nIn 2008, the rules regarding safety in the sport were changed. One change stated that a fall anywhere during the cross-country phase resulted in elimination, even if the rider was galloping on course and not approaching a jump, or in the middle of a combination.\n\n==== Scoring ====\n[[Image:Tim price vortex refusal dairy mounds burghley 2009.jpg|thumb|right|Tim Price does well to stay on as Vortex refuses at the Dairy Mounds during the cross-country phase of Burghley Horse Trials 2009.]]\n* [[Refusal (horse)|Refusal]], run-out, or circle:\n** At the same obstacle:\n*** First: 20 penalties\n*** Second: 40 penalties\n*** 20 penalties at each question\n** In the round (for instance one refusal at each of several different obstacles):\n*** Third (used to be fourth refusal, and still is for lower national levels in some countries only): elimination (E)\n*Activating a frangible device on cross country at an FEI competition will now award 11 penalties under the ground juries discretion\n* Fall of rider: elimination (E)\n* Fall of horse (shoulder and hind touch the ground): elimination (E)\n* Exceeding the time:\n** Optimum: 0.4 penalties per second\n** Limit (twice the optimum): elimination (E)\n* Coming in under speed fault time: 1 penalties per second (lower national levels in some countries only)\n\n==== Other faults ====\n* Competing with improper saddlery: elimination (E)\n* Jumping without headgear or a properly fastened harness: elimination (E)\n* Error of course not rectified: elimination (E)\n* Omission of obstacle: elimination (E)\n* Jumping an obstacle in the wrong order or direction: elimination (E)\n* Retaking an obstacle already jumped: elimination (E)\n* Dangerous riding, at determination of the ground jury: elimination (usually with a warning first) (E)\n* Failure to wear medical armband: elimination (at discretion of ground jury) (E)\n* 4 refusals on whole course: elimination (E) (only in horse trails. If you are competing in FEI, you get 2 refusals and your third is elimination.)\n\n==== Types of obstacles ====\n{{Main|Cross-country equestrianism|Indoor cross-country|Horse jumping obstacles}}\n\n[[Image:3DE combinaison direct way.svg|right|thumb|200px|The \"direct route\" when jumping cross-country]]\n[[Image:3DE combinaison optional way.svg|right|thumb|200px|If the rider has a refusal at the direct route, he may jump the other B element without additional penalty than incurred for the refusal.]] \nA combination is always considered one obstacle, and the various elements within the combination are lettered \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", and so on. In cross-country, the rider need only retake the element they refused rather than the whole complex. So a refusal at element B does not require them to jump A again. However, they have the option of retaking the previous elements if they wish. For example, in a bounce type obstacle it may be physically impossible to approach B without first clearing A. Yet for some in and outs, you can go to B and not have to rejump A.\n\nMany cross-country obstacles have several possible routes to take (for example, at obstacle 5 there may be 2 A, 2 B, and 2 C elements), with one route usually being faster but requiring a more skillful ride or more physical effort from the horse. A rider may take any of the possible routes as long as they pass over each letter once. Additionally, after a refusal, they may jump a different obstacle of the same letter in place of the original.\n\nA refusal at A is a first refusal, and would receive 20 penalties. Whether the rider retakes A or not, a subsequent refusal at B is a second refusal and so on. Three refusals at any one obstacle results in elimination, as does 4 refusals on the entire course.\n\n====Ten Minute Box====\n\nThe \"Ten Minute Box\" is a compulsory halt included during the cross-country section of a three-day event after the roads and tracks and steeplechase phases and before the \"pure\" cross-country jumping phase. It is a pause designed to allow the horse (and rider!) time to cool off, rest and stabilize its vitals and ensure that it is prepared for the \"pure\" cross-country phase. In the Ten Minute Box, riders and assistants will cool the horse down, walk the horse around and check tack and studs and a veterinarian will inspect the horse - including checking its heart and respiration rates - to determine if it is fit to compete in the final \"pure\" cross-country phase.\n\n===Stadium jumping===\n[[Image:RolexFence1.JPG|thumb|Show jumping phase at the Land Rover Kentucky Three Day Event]]\n{{Main|Show jumping}}\n\nStadium or show jumping is the final phase of eventing competition and tests the technical jumping skills of the horse and rider, including suppleness, obedience, fitness, and athleticism. In this phase, 12\u201320 fences are set up in a ring. These fences are typically brightly colored and consist of elements that can be knocked down, unlike cross-country obstacles. This phase is also timed, with penalties being given for every second over the required time. In addition to normal jumping skills, eventing show jumping tests the fitness and stamina of the horse and rider, generally being held after the cross-country phase in higher level and international events.\n\n==== Scoring ====\n* Knocking down an obstacle: 4 penalties\n* Disobedience (refusal, run-out, circle, moving backwards) over the whole round:\n** First: 4 penalties\n** Second:  Elimination\n* Fall of rider: Elimination\n* Fall of horse: Elimination\n* Exceeding the time allowed: 0.4 of a penalty per second\n* Jumping an obstacle in the wrong order: Elimination\n* Error of course not rectified: Elimination\n\nAn obstacle is defined as having been knocked down if any part of its height is lowered. It is therefore possible to knock out a pole below the top pole and receive no penalties, as long as the highest pole stays in place, so that the jump retains the same height. It does count as a knockdown if the highest pole falls out of one jump cup but remains in the other; although part of the pole remains at the original height, the other part is lowered.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Rules of Each Event Phase and How They Are Scored|url=http://www.britisheventing.com/section.asp?section=681&sectionTitle=The+Phases+explained|publisher=British Eventing|accessdate=15 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528130943/http://www.britisheventing.com/section.asp?section=681&sectionTitle=The+Phases+explained|archive-date=28 May 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Jumping Rules|url=http://www.fei.org/sites/default/files/file/OFFICIALS%20%26%20ORGANISERS/ORGANISERS/JUMPING/Technical%20Info/JumpRules_24thEd_2013_clean_1.pdf|publisher=F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Equestre Internationale|accessdate=15 December 2012}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe winner is the horse and rider with the fewest penalties. Awards are usually presented while mounted, before the placed riders take a lap of honor around the arena.\n\n==History==\n===Olympic beginning===\n{{See also|Equestrian at the Summer Olympics}}\nEventing competition that resembles the current three-day were first held in 1902, at the [[Championnat du Cheval d'Armes]] in [[France]], and was introduced into the [[Equestrian at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] starting [[Equestrian at the 1912 Summer Olympics|1912]] in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]. [[Dressage]] originally demonstrated the horse's ability to perform on the parade ground, where elegance and obedience were key. [[Cross-country equestrianism|Cross-country]] began as a test of stamina, courage, and bravery over difficult terrain, important for a [[wikt:charger#Noun|charger]] on long marches or if the horse was asked to carry a dispatch across country. The [[show jumping|stadium jumping]] phase sought to prove the horse's continuing soundness and fitness after the difficult cross-country day.\n\nThe Olympic eventing competition was originally open only to male military officers in active duty, mounted only on military charges. In 1924, the event was open to male civilians, although [[Non-commissioned officer|non-commissioned Army officers]] could not participate in the Olympics until 1956. Women were first allowed to take part in 1964; equestrian sports are one of the few Olympic sports in which men and women compete against one another.\n\n===Format===\nThe original format, used in the [[Equestrian at the 1912 Summer Olympics \u2013 Individual eventing|1912 Olympics]], was spread over several days:\n*'''Day 1''': Endurance test comprising {{convert|55|km|mi|abbr=on}} (with a time allowed of 4 hours, giving a speed of approx. 230 meters per minute) immediately followed by {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} of a flagged cross-country course at a speed of 333 meters per minute. Time penalties were given for exceeding the time allowed, but no bonus points were given for being fast.\n*'''Day 2''': Rest day\n*'''Day 3''': [[steeplechase (horse racing)|Steeplechase]] test of {{convert|3.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} with 10 plain obstacles, at a speed of 600 mpm, with time penalties but no time bonus points\n*'''Day 4''': Jumping test (\"prize jumping\"), which was considered easy by most of the spectators\n*'''Day 5''': Dressage test (\"prize riding\")\n\nThe [[1924 Summer Olympics|Paris Games]] in 1924 introduced a format very similar to the one of today: with day 1 dressage, day 2 the endurance test, and day 3 the jumping test. The endurance test has changed the most since that time. Originally, bonus points could be earned for a fast ride cross-country (less than the optimum time). This helped competitors make up for a poor dressage ride, with a clean, fast cross-country ride. This system, however, was dropped in 1971. The format for the endurance test occurred as below:\n\n*'''Phase A''': Short roads and tracks (with five penalties per 5 seconds over time)\n*'''Phase B''': Steeplechase, decreased in speed from 600 mpm to 550 mpm (with 10 penalties added per 5 seconds over the time, 3 bonus points per 5 seconds under time)\n*'''Phase C''': Long roads and tracks (with 5 penalties per 5 seconds over time)\n*'''Compulsory Halt''' (now the 10-minute halt)\n*'''Phase D''': Cross-country (with 10 penalties added per 5 seconds over the time, 3 bonus points per 10 seconds under time)\n*'''Phase E''': 1.25 mile run on the flat (with 5 penalties per 5 seconds over time).\n\n(Note: Phase E was abolished in 1967.)\n\nIn 1963, the 10-minute halt was introduced, to occur after the completion of phases A, B, and C. It took place in a marked out area (the 10-minute box), where the horse was checked by two judges and one veterinary official who would make sure the horse was fit to continue onto phase D. If the horse was unfit, the panel would pull it from the competition.\n\nThe format of the sport underwent major changes in 2004 and 2005, with the creation of the \"short\" or \"modified format\", which excluded phases A, B, and C from endurance day. The primary reason for excluding these phases was that the Olympic Committee was considering dropping the sport of eventing from the Olympics because of the cost and large area required for the speed and endurance phase with a steeplechase course and several miles of roads-and-tracks. To prevent the elimination of the sport from the Olympics program, the \"short format\" was developed by the FEI. The last Olympic Games that included the long, or \"classic\", three-day format was the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney, while [[Rolex Kentucky Three Day|Rolex Kentucky]], the [[Badminton Horse Trials]], and [[Burghley Horse Trials]] ran their last long format three-day in 2005. The short format is now the standard for international competition, such as the Olympics and [[World Equestrian Games]].\n\nThe change in format has brought about controversy. Some riders support the continuation of the classic format, believing it is the \"true test of horse and rider\". Others believe the classic format is superior because it teaches horsemanship, due to the extra preparation needed to condition the horse and the care required after the several miles of endurance day. However, others prefer the short format, as they believe it saves wear-and-tear on their horses and allows the horse not only to compete in more three-day events each season, but decreases the chance of injury to the horse. However, this claim has not held true in several recent studies that compared injuries sustained in classic and in short format competitions over equivalent courses.  Further, some research indicates that horses are more stressed by the short format than by the careful warm-up inherent in the classic format.  Regardless, many upper-level riders prepare their horses for the short format using the same conditioning and training as for the long format. The short format has also been widely urged by breeders of heavier, warmblood-type horses. The long format has remained popular at the Novice and Training levels in the United States, and with riders who feel it maximizes horsemanship.\n\n===Veterinary inspection, or \"trot up\"/\"horse inspection\"===\nBefore the beginning of a three-day event, and also before the last phase, horses are inspected by a vet to ensure that they are fit to compete further. It is usually a formal affair, with well-groomed and braided horses, and nicely dressed riders. It is also a very nerve-wracking time, as the \"pass\" or \"fail\" determines whether the horse may continue with the competition. A vet can request that a horse be sent to the holding box, where it will then be re-assessed before being allowed to continue.  In upper level FEI classes, a second veterinarian (often called the Associate FEI Veterinarian) may inspect horses sent to the hold box and make the decision to pass or fail a horse.  This practice is in place so that no one veterinarian has complete power to eliminate a horse and allows for a large number of horses to be evaluated in a timely manner.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fei.org/sites/default/files/FINALVeterinary%20Regulations%20proposed%20changes%20for%202012_6_.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-20 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130429093745/http://www.fei.org/sites/default/files/FINALVeterinary%20Regulations%20proposed%20changes%20for%202012_6_.pdf |archivedate=2013-04-29 |df= }}</ref>\n\nIn lower levels of competition, the horse's movement may be analyzed as they finish the cross-country, where they will be asked to trot briefly after crossing the finishing line to satisfy the vet of their soundness.\n\n===Penalty point system===\nIn 1971, the penalty point system was first introduced into eventing. This system converts the dressage score and all jump penalties on cross-country and show jumping into penalty points, with the horse and rider with the fewest points winning the event. Different weight is given for each phase, with the cross-country \u2014 the heart of eventing \u2014 being the most important, followed by the dressage and then the show jumping. The intended ratio of cross-country:dressage:show jumping is theoretically 12:3:1. Therefore, an error in cross-country counts heavily. This prevents horses that are simply good in dressage (for example) from winning the event with a poor cross-country test.\n\nIn 1971, the following penalty system was instituted:\n*'''Phase A and C''': 1 penalty per second over the optimum time\n*'''Phase B''': 0.8 penalties per second over\n*'''Phase D''': 0.4 penalties per second over\n\nIn 1977, the dressage scoring was changed, with each movement marked out of ten rather than out of six. This increased the maximum number of dressage marks from 144 to 240. This number later increased to 250 marks in 1998, after additional movements were added. To keep the correct weight, a formula is used to convert good marks in dressage to penalty points. First, the marks of the judges (if there is more than one) are averaged. Then the raw mark is subtracted from the maximum points possible. This number is then multiplied by 0.6 to calculate the final penalty score.\n\nShow jumping rules were also changed in 1977, with a knock-down or a foot in the water awarded only 5 penalties rather than 10. This prevented the show jumping phase from carrying too much weight, again, to keep the ratio between the phases correct.\n\n====Current scoring====\nThe dressage score is converted to a percentage and the penalty points calculated by subtracting the percentage from 100. This is rounded to 1 decimal digit.<ref>{{cite book |title=Eventing Rules 25th Edition effective 1st January 2019 |date=3 December 2018 |publisher=F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Equestre Internationale |location=Switzerland |pages=62\u201363}}</ref>\n\nIn cross country, penalty points are awarded for jumping errors and for time.<ref>{{cite book |title=Eventing Rules 25th Edition effective 1st January 2019 |date=3 December 2018 |publisher=F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Equestre Internationale |location=Switzerland |page=69}}</ref> In the jumping, 20 penalty points are awarded for a first refusal at an obstacle and 40 penalty points for a second refusal (the rider is eliminated on their third refusal). Two refusals at different obstacles each attract 20 penalty points. If a horse jumps an obstacle, but the body of the horse does not pass completely between the flags, 15 penalty points are awarded, only if the horse would have cleared the obstacle's height had it been better positioned. If a horse activates an obstacle's [[frangible device]], 11 penalty points are awarded.\n\nTime penalties<ref>{{cite book |title=Eventing Rules 25th Edition effective 1st January 2019 |date=3 December 2018 |publisher=F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Equestre Internationale |location=Switzerland |page=69}}</ref> are awarded for being too slow over the optimum time at a rate of 0.4 penalty points per second over this time up to the time limit (twice the optimum time) at which point the competitor is eliminated. Some national bodies implement a fastest time allowed for lower grades where more inexperienced riders compete. The fastest time allowed can range from 20 seconds to 45 seconds faster than the optimum time. Typically, penalty points are awarded at a rate of 1 per second faster than this time.\n\nIn the show jumping test,<ref>{{cite book |title=Eventing Rules 25th Edition effective 1st January 2019 |date=3 December 2018 |publisher=F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Equestre Internationale |location=Switzerland |pages=72\u201373}}</ref> either knocking down of the obstacle or refusing to jump the obstacle attracts 4 penalty points. In the case of a knock, riders are permitted to continue to the next obstacle. However, if the obstacle was refused, it must be reattempted. A second refusal at the same obstacle results in elimination. Similarly to the cross country, time penalty points are awarded at a rate of 0.4 penalty points per second commenced over the optimum time.\n\n===Non-Olympic competition===\nIn its early days, the sport was most popular in Britain, and the British gave the competition a new name, the \"Three-Day Event\", due to the three-day time span of the competition. In America, the sport was also called \"combined training\", due to the three different disciplines and types of training methods needed for the horse.  In the [[United Kingdom]], \"combined training\" competition includes only the dressage and show jumping phases.\n\nIn between a 'combined training' and a 'horse trial', there are also 'short courses'. Short courses consist of a dressage phase and a jumping phase. The jumping phase usually starts in the stadium ring with a fence leading out to a smaller field with some cross-country fences (not as many as in a horse trial's cross-country phase). The rider will then jump back into the stadium ring to finish his or her course.\n\nThe first annual, Olympic-level event developed was the [[Badminton Horse Trials]], held each year in England. First held in 1949, the Badminton event was created after a poor performance by the British Eventing Team at the 1948 Olympic Games, with the purpose of being a high-class preparation event, and as extra exposure for the military horses, who very rarely had the chance to compete. Initially, only British riders were allowed to compete (although women were allowed, despite being banned from riding in the Olympics), but the competition is now an international open to all riders from around the world who have qualified for this level of competition.  Along with Burghley and Kentucky, Badminton is one of the most prestigious events to win in the world.  Currently, the Olympic event is considered a CCI****, a rank lower than Badminton which is a CCI*****.\n\nThe second three-day competition to be held at Olympic level each year was the [[Burghley Horse Trials]], first held in 1961. Burghley is the longest running international event.\n\nThe first CCI held outside of Britain on an annual basis is the [[Rolex Kentucky Three Day]], held each year in Lexington since 1978.\n\n===Importance of dressage training===\nIn the early years, the dressage phase was fairly inconsequential in determining the final standings. It was quite possible for a horse to have a terrible dressage test, then run a clean cross-country and show jumping, and still finish near the top of the standings. Since then, correct dressage training has become increasingly important should a horse and rider wish to be placed (complete all sections and finish in the top 12). This can be traced back to [[Sheila Willcox]], who took a particular interest in dressage, becoming abundantly clear when she won Badminton three years running in the 1950s. She had a strong influence on [[Mary King (equestrian)|Mary King]] and [[Lucinda Green]] amongst others.\n\nAfter the 2000 Olympic Games, the [[International Federation for Equestrian Sports|FEI]] hired British eventer and dressage rider [[Christopher Bartle]] to write new dressage tests for the upper-level events, which would include a greater deal of collection. This has since raised the standard even further in the dressage phase.\n\nAdditionally, the cross-country phase has become more technical, asking the horse to be adjustable and supple through [[Combination (jump)|combinations]]. A horse can no longer just be brave and athletic but must have a good deal of dressage training should his rider wish to successfully negotiate odd distances or bending lines at a gallop.  Also, in show jumping, a horse is asked to move with impulsion and engagement; this makes the jump more fluent, brings the horse to [[Bascule_(horse)]] more correctly, and is less jarring for both horse and rider.\n\n===Safety===\nBetween 1997 and December 2008, at least 37 eventing riders died as a result of injuries incurred while competing in the cross-country phase of eventing at national or international level or at Pony Club. Of these, 18 riders died in the period 2006\u20132008. These 37 fatal falls have been at all levels of the sport, from domestic one-day events up to regional championships level, and they have occurred in most of the recognized eventing countries around the world, with concentrations in the United Kingdom (14) and the United States (8). At least 25 of these 37 deaths have resulted from a somersaulting (rotational) fall of the horse, with 11 of the 16 deaths in 2007 and 2008 being reported as having resulted from [[rotational falls]].&nbsp;<ref name=Horsetalk081219>Horsetalk \u2013 [http://www.horsetalk.co.nz/saferide/131-eventingincrisis.shtml Eventing in crisis?] 19 December 2008</ref>\n\nInformation about horse fatalities is difficult to locate, but at least 19 eventing horses, many of them top-level performers, died in 2007 and 2008, most of them in the US.&nbsp;<ref name=Horsetalk081219 />\n\nOver time, course design has become increasingly more focused on the safety of the horse and rider. Fences are built more solidly than in the earlier days, encouraging a bold jump from the horse, which actually helps prevent falls. The layout of the course and the build of the obstacles encourage the horse to have a successful run. This includes greater use of precision fences, such as [[corner (fence)|corner]]s and \"skinny jumps\", that are very good tests of the rider's ability and the horse's training but allow the horse to simply run around the jump if the rider misjudges it. Safety measures such as filling in the area between corner-shaped jumps on cross-country or rails of a fence help prevent the entrapment of the legs of the horse decrease the number of serious falls or injuries.\n\nThe newest improvement in cross-country safety is the ''frangible'' fence, which uses a pin and other techniques which allow the fence to \"break or fall\" in a controlled manner to minimize the risk of injury to horse and rider. This can help to prevent the most dangerous situation on cross-country, when the horse hits a solid fence between the forearm and chest, and somersaults over ([[Rotational falls|rotational fall]]), sometimes falling on the rider. This type of fall has caused the deaths of several riders and horses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eventingsafety.wordpress.com/|title=Eventing Safety and Risk Management|author=|date=|website=Eventing Safety and Risk Management|accessdate=26 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nLeg protection for horses has also improved. Very little was used in the early days, even on cross-country. Leg protection is now seen on nearly every horse at all levels. Boots have increased technologically, and include materials that either help absorb shock or are very hard and strong to prevent a serious injury.\n\nRules protecting riders have improved as well. Riders are now required to wear a safety vest (body protector) during cross-country, as well as an [[ASTM]]/[[Safety Equipment Institute|SEI]] or [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] approved [[equestrian helmet]] equipped with a retention harness,<ref>[http://www.equisearch.com/horses_riding_training/tack_apparel/english/safety100703/ Barakat, Christine. \"Riding Helmet Safety Standards Explained\" ''Equisearch''.

Eventing was one of the first sports to require the use of a helmet with harness when jumping. As of 2010, more riders were wearing [[air bag vest]]s, which automatically inflate if a rider falls off the horse.<ref>Thomas, Katie. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/24/sports/24airbag.html \"Added Safety in the Saddle\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 23, 2010. Accessed August 25, 2010.</ref>\n\n===Weight rule===\nFrom the beginning, event horses had to carry a minimum weight of {{convert|165|lb|abbr=on}} (including rider and saddle) during the endurance test, since military horses were expected to be able to carry such weight. Lead weights were carried on the saddle, and the competitor had to be weighed-in with tack immediately following cross-country. The weight was reduced to {{convert|154|lb|abbr=on}} for the 1996 Olympic Games, after a study demonstrated that both the horse's arc over a fence became shallower and the leading leg took a great deal of extra force on landing when the horse was carrying dead weight than when free from the burden. The rule was eventually abolished January 1, 1998. By removing this rule, the stress on the joints and soft-tissue, as well as the chance of a fall, were decreased.<ref>Bryant, Jennifer O.

Lexington, KY: Blood-Horse Publications, 2008.{{page needed|date=July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==International competition==\n{{noref section|date=May 2019}}\n[[Image:Burghley 2004.jpg|thumb|right|Burghley is one of the most prestigious international events.]]\nInternational events have specific categories and levels of competition and are conducted under the rules of the [[International Federation for Equestrian Sports|FEI]]. [[Concours Complet International|CCI]] (Concours Complet International, or International Complete Contest) is one such category and defines a three-day event that is open to competitors from any foreign nation as well as the host nation.\n\n*[[Concours Complet International|CCI]] : International Three-day event (Concours Complet International)\n*CIC: International One-day event (Concours International Combin\u00e9)\n*CCIO: International Team Competitions (Concours Complet International Officiel). Includes the Olympics, the [[Eventing World Championship|World Championships]], the Pan Am Games, and other continental championships\n\nThe levels of international events are identified by the number of stars next to the category; there are four levels in total. A CCI* is for horses that are just being introduced to international competition. A CCI** is geared for horses that have some experience of international competition. CCI*** is the advanced level of competition.\n\nThe very highest level of competition is the CCI****, and with only six such competitions in the world ([[Badminton Horse Trials|Badminton]], [[Burghley Horse Trials|Burghley]], [[Kentucky Three-Day Event|Kentucky]], [[Australian International Three Day Event|Adelaide]], [[Luhmuhlen Horse Trials]], and the [[\u00c9toiles de Pau|Stars of Pau]]) it is the ultimate aim of many riders. The [[Eventing World Championship|World Championships]] are also considered CCI****. Rolex offer a financial prize for any rider who can win three of the biggest competitions in succession. These are Badminton, Burghley and Kentucky. So far, Pippa Funnell (Great Britain) and Michael Jung (Germany) are the only riders to do this. Andrew Hoy did come close, however, and in 2010 [[Oliver Townend]] was competing for this coveted \"Grand Slam\" at Rolex Kentucky when he suffered a fall at obstacle #20 which eliminated him from competition.\n\nOne, two and three-star competitions are roughly comparable to the Novice, Intermediate and Advanced levels of British domestic competition, respectively, and to the Preliminary, Intermediate, and Advanced levels of American domestic competition, respectively.\n\n==National competition==\nEventing rules and the recognized levels in various nations are similar, but not always identical.  While rules usually follow the FEI to some degree, history and tradition of various nations has also influenced competition rules within a given country.\n\nIn addition to recognized events that prepare the best riders for international competition, many nations also offer eventing for beginner, youth, and amateur riders through organizations such as [[Pony Club]], [[4-H]] or other riding clubs, where most riders begin their competitive careers.  At the most elementary levels, fence heights begin at around 18&nbsp;inches to {{convert|2|ft|m|abbr=on}}.\n\n===Australia===\nIn Australia, where [[Equestrian Australia]] governs eventing competition, the levels are as follows:\n* Encouragers: XC:  fences maximum height 0.45m 375 m/min; Stadium fences: 0.45m\n* Newcomers: XC:  fences maximum height 0.60m 350 m/min; Stadium fences: 0.60m\n* Introductory: XC: fences maximum height 0.80 m ditch 1.40 m drops 1.0 m 400 m/min; Stadium fences: 0.8 m\n* Preliminary: XC: fences maximum height 0.95 m ditch 2.00 m drops 1.2 m 450 m/min; Stadium fences: 0.95 m\n* Pre Novice: XC: fences maximum height 1.05 m ditch 2.40 m drops 1.4, 500 m/min; Stadium fences: 1.05 m\n* 1 Star: XC: fences maximum height 1.10 m ditch 2.80 m drops 1.6 m 520 m/min; Stadium fences: 1.15 m\n* 2 Star: XC: fences maximum height 1.15 m ditch 3.20 m drops 1.8 m 550 m/min; Stadium fences: 1.20 m\n* 3 Star: XC: fences maximum height 1.20 m ditch 3.60 m drops 2.0 m 570 m/min; Stadium fences: 1.25 m\n\nThe Sydney International Three Day Event is a main qualification event in [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]] for eventing in Australia.<ref>\n* {{cite web |url=http://horsezone.com.au/news/only-4-weeks-to-go-until-sydney-international-three-day-event-2396/#l4XgDF1pYKIDRX8B.97 |title=Only 4 Weeks to Go until Sydney International Three Day Event |publisher=Horsezone |access-date=18 July 2017}}\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/teenager-dies-while-competing-in-the-sydney-international-horse-trials-20160430-goivgz.html |title=Teenager dies while competing in the Sydney International Horse Trials |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |publisher=FairfaxMedia |access-date=18 July 2017 |date=1 May 2016 |first1=Daisy |last1=Dumas |first2=Georgina |last2=Mitchell |first3=Emily |last3=Woods |first4=Melanie |last4=Kembrey}}\n</ref>\n\n===Canada===\nThe Canadian levels, under the rules of [[Equine Canada]], are as follows:\n* Pre-Entry XC: fences maximum height .75 m no drops, no mandatory water.

Stadium fences 3&nbsp;ft 5 in (1.04 m), 10-13 efforts.\n* Preliminary: X-C fences {{convert|3|ft|7|in|abbr=on|m}}, 22\u201330 efforts, ditch {{convert|9|ft|2|in|abbr=on|m}}, drops {{convert|5|ft|3|in|abbr=on|m}}, 520 m/min; Stadium fences {{convert|3|ft|7|in|abbr=on|m}}, 11\u201313 efforts.\n* Intermediate: X-C fences {{convert|3|ft|9|in|m|abbr=on}}, 26\u201334 efforts, ditch {{convert|10|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}}, drops {{convert|5|ft|11|in|m|abbr=on}}, 550 m/min; Stadium fences {{convert|3|ft|11|in|m|abbr=on}}, 12\u201314 efforts.\n* Advanced: X-C fences {{convert|3|ft|11|in|m|abbr=on}}, 32\u201340 efforts, ditch {{convert|11|ft|10|in|m|abbr=on}}, drops {{convert|6|ft|7|in|m|abbr=on}}, 570 m/min; Stadium fences {{convert|4|ft|1|in|m|abbr=on}}, 13\u201315 efforts.\n\nIt is also common to see inter-levels (such as the Intermediate/Preliminary, or IP), which help riders transition between levels by using the dressage and show jumping tests of the higher level and the cross-country course of the lower, and starter levels, which use the dressage test and stadium course standards of the lower CT levels (e.g., Amoeba, Tadpole, Green as Grass) with a very simple cross-country course. However, the starter levels are considered \"test\" levels and thus do not have a consistent standard (or a national points system and leaderboard).\n\n==Horse==\nIn the lower levels, it is possible for any [[list of horse breeds|breed of horse]], if it has the talent for it, to do well in eventing.  [[Thoroughbred]]s and part-Thoroughbreds currently dominate the sport at the top levels because of their stamina and athletic ability, although many [[warmblood]]s and warmblood-thoroughbred crosses also do well. In the UK, [[Irish Horse|Irish sport horses]] have been popular for many years.\n\nBecause larger horses are favored, animals with some [[draft horse]] breeding are also seen, notably the [[Irish Draught]] and [[Clydesdale horse|Clydesdale]] crossbreds.  However, smaller horses can also excel; for example, the third place competitor in the 2007 [[Rolex Kentucky Three Day]] CCI competition was [[Theodore O'Connor]], a {{hands|14.1}} gelding that was a cross of Thoroughbred, [[Arabian horse|Arabian]] and [[Shetland pony]] breeding.<ref>\"Karen O'Connor and 'The Pony' Theodore O'Connor Wow The Crowd, Finishing Third\"  Accessed June 21, 2007 at http://www.horsesdaily.com/news/eventing/2007/07rolex/04-29-oconnor.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827152504/http://horsesdaily.com/news/eventing/2007/07rolex/04-29-oconnor.html |date=2016-08-27 }}</ref>\n\nAn event horse must be very responsive to succeed, as a horse that will not listen to a rider on the cross-country phase may end up taking a fall at a jump. The horse should be calm and submissive for the dressage phase, with good training on the flat. For cross-country, the horse must be brave, athletic, and (especially at the higher levels) fast with a good galloping stride and great stamina. The horse does not have to possess perfect jumping form, but should be safe over fences and have good scope. The best event horses are careful over jumps, as those who are not tend to have stadium rails knocked down on the last day. The horse also needs to have sound [[horse conformation|conformation]] and good [[horse hoof|feet]].\n\n==Riding attire==\nRiding attire is different in each of the three phases.  Dressage and stadium jumping feature the traditional turnout for each of those disciplines, requiring conservative attire. However, as of 2017 lower level divisions in the United States allow for more flexibility in the rider's attire. Cross-country attire and equipment emphasizes and requires safety protocols be followed, but has less formal appearance, with many riders wearing clothing of personalized, often bright colors. Under FEI rules, civilian riders may opt to wear the uniform of their riding club, and members of the military and national studs are required to wear service dress in the dressage and stadium jumping phases.<ref name=\"FEI 2013 Eventing Rules\">{{cite book|title=FEI Eventing Rules 24th Edition|year=2013|publisher=International Equestrian Federation|location=Lausanne, Switzerland|page=54|url=http://fei.org/sites/default/files/2013_Eventing_Rules_Final_March_changes_integrated.pdf|access-date=2013-09-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004215507/http://fei.org/sites/default/files/2013_Eventing_Rules_Final_March_changes_integrated.pdf|archive-date=2013-10-04|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref>\n\n===Dressage===\nFor the intermediate and advanced levels, riders usually wear dressage attire similar to that of [[Grand Prix Dressage]], including a [[top hat]] and white [[riding breeches]]. However, even at the most senior levels (e.g., the World Equestrian Games, the Olympics, and CCI****) the actual FEI dress requirements are less strict, requiring only \"hunting dress\"; a white shirt and a tie of any kind; gloves of any colour; white, fawn, or cream breeches; and [[riding boots]] of any colour.<ref name=\"FEI 2013 Eventing Rules\" /> The wearing of [[shadbelly]] or other tailcoat jackets is not compulsory in the dressage phase.<ref name=\"FEI 2013 Eventing Rules\" />\n\nRules at non-FEI competition vary.  In the  USA, formal attire is not required if all phases run in one day or for the lower levels.<ref name=\"2013 USEF Eventing Rules\">{{cite book|url=https://www.usef.org/forms-pubs/KlV5P9prkmM/ev-eventing-division|title=USEF Rules for Eventing|last=|first=|publisher=United States Equestrian Federation|year=2013|isbn=|location=Lexington, KY, United States|page=|pages=}}</ref> Though navy and black coats are the preferred traditional style, riders may wear any conservatively colored dark  or tweed hunting coat with a white shirt and choker or, preferably, a stock tie with pin.  If a rider wishes to stay within traditional requirements for higher-level competition, breeches should be white, fawn, or cream.  A black or navy hunt cap or [[derby]] hat may be worn, although many riders use an [[equestrian helmet]], which are considered safer.<ref name=\"2013 USEF Eventing Rules\"/>  Helmets are compulsory at lower levels.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nBoots may be field or dress style, black or brown in color.<ref name=\"2013 USEF Eventing Rules\"/>  Gloves and spurs give a polished appearance but are not required at lower levels. Dressage gloves are traditionally white, although other colors are permitted. [[Spur]]s, when worn, are restricted to certain lengths and types. [[Riding boots]] such as field or dress tall boots are usually black.\n\n===Cross-country===\n[[Image:R3DE XCountry.JPG|right|thumb|Attire in the cross-country phase is the least formal, and many riders choose \"eventing colours\", to which they match some of their horse's tack.]] The rider is required to wear a body protector vest, an approved [[equestrian helmet]] which must be properly fastened at all times when jumping, and a medical armband, containing the rider's medical history, allowing access to the information should the rider fall, be knocked unconscious, and require medical treatment.\n\nFEI rules<ref>{{cite book |title=Eventing Rules |date=3 December 2018 |publisher=F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Equestre Internationale |location=Switzerland |page=56 |edition=25th}}</ref> allow riders to dress as they please in the cross-country phase. Light-weight rugby or polo shirts are the most commonly worn shirt style, usually without a stock or tie.  Riding coats are generally not worn. Many riders wear a stop-watch to track their time so that they may adjust their speed to come in as close as possible to the optimum time.\n\n===Stadium jumping===\nEventing riders tend to follow the dress practices of showjumpers in the stadium jumping phase.  However,  FEI rules only require \"hunting dress\"; white shirt and tie of any kind; white, fawn, or cream breeches; and boots of any kind.<ref name=\"FEI 2013 Eventing Rules\" />\n \nIn most nations' nationally sanctioned competitions, and often even at lower levels, a protective [[equestrian helmet]] with harness is required, and a short hunt coat is traditional, except when weather is unreasonably warm, when, at the discretion of the technical delegate, jackets may be considered optional.  If helmet covers are used, they are required to be black or dark blue though some now include national colors where they are entitled to be worn.\n\n==Turnout of the horse and tack==\n\n===Turnout and grooming===\nEvent horses are turned out similarly to dressage horses, with the legs and face (muzzle, jaw, sides of ears, [[bridle path (horse)|bridle path]]) neatly clipped. The tail is usually \"banged\" (cut straight across), usually to a length between the fetlock joint and lower hock. Additionally, most event riders clip the sides of their mount's tails, to give them a finer appearance. The braiding of tails is fairly uncommon, probably because the tail can not be braided if the hairs along the sides of the dock are clipped.\n\nThe [[mane (horse)|mane]] is pulled to about 3 inches in length and is usually braided for dressage as well as the show jumping phase. However, most riders prefer to leave it loose for cross-country in case they need to grab it for security. Some riders also place [[quarter marks]] (decorative stenciling) on the hindquarters.\n\n===Tack===\n[[Image:Rolex XCountry.JPG|right|thumb|A horse on cross-country, showing the \"eventer's grease\" on his legs to help him slide over obstacles.]]\nMost event riders have a jumping saddle as well as a dressage saddle since each places them in a position better-suited for its purpose. At the lower levels, however, a rider can ride all three phases without difficulty in a well-fitted jumping saddle. At the upper levels, riders usually have a saddle specifically designed for cross-country, giving them more freedom for such fences as [[bank (obstacle)|banks and drops]].\n\nDressage tack is usually black in color, with a [[saddle blanket|white square pad]], giving a formal look. Except for the upper levels, where a [[double bridle]] is permitted, horses may only be ridden in [[snaffle bit]]s. There are strict guidelines as to what type of snaffle may be used, and the more severe types (such as any twisted bit) are prohibited. If a double bridle is used, a plain cavesson or crank [[noseband]] must be worn. With a snaffle bridle, the rider is also free to use the drop, flash, or grackle noseband, with the flash and plain cavesson being the most common. [[Breastplate (tack)|Breastplates]] are also fairly common in dressage at an event, despite the fact that they are not seen at regular dressage shows. Other forms of equipment, such as [[Martingale (tack)|martingale]]s, protective boots, gadgets/training devices, bit guards, [[polo wraps]], or tail wraps, are not allowed during the test.\n\n[[Image:R3DE StadiumJump.jpg|right|thumb|Horse and rider well turned-out for the stadium jumping phase. Note the rider wears a medical armband.]]\nIn show jumping, the rider uses a jumping saddle, usually with a square or fitted white pad. Rules on tack are less-stringent, and most forms of bridling and bitting are allowed, including the use of [[gag bit]]s, [[hackamore]]s, and any type of noseband. Breastplates and open front boots are usually worn. [[Martingale (tack)|Running martingales]] are also allowed, but must be used with rein stops. Standing and Irish martingales are not allowed.\n\nFor the cross-country phase, the rider usually uses similar tack as for the show jumping. However, cross-country boots are used for extra protection, to help prevent injury if they were to hit the solid obstacles. Most horses that wear shoes are also fitted with [[horse shoe studs]], to prevent slipping. At the upper levels, riders may also apply a grease or lard to the front of the horse's legs, to help the horse slide over fences if they hang a leg. Riders also tend to color-coordinate their cross-country tack to their colors. For example, using the same color saddle pad and tape for their boots, to match their shirt and protective vest.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Rotational falls]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons and category|Eventing|Eventing}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20091124084331/http://www.ponygalaxy.com/three-day-eventing/ Eventing Article on Pony Galaxy]\n* [http://www.fei.org/Disciplines/Eventing/ Eventing on the official site of the global governing body, the FEI]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070309121756/http://www.eventingusa.com/ United States Eventing Association]\n* [http://www.britisheventing.com British Eventing Association]\n* [http://eventingsafety.wordpress.com/ Eventing Safety & Risk Management]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20190514023639/https://www.eventingireland.com/ Eventing Ireland]\n* [http://www.eventingincanada.com/ Eventing In Canada]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070930064428/http://www.usriderfund.org/ USREF \u2013 The US non-profit organization that promotes safety and welfare in Eventing]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090201180450/http://www.eeicup.com/ Express Eventing \u2013 the new compact version of the sport]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100620015005/http://usef.org/_IFrames/breedsDisciplines/discipline/allEventing.aspx United States Equestrian Federation Eventing]\n\n{{Equestrian Sports}}\n{{Summer Olympic sports}}\n\n[[Category:Eventing| ]]\n[[Category:Summer Olympic disciplines]]\n[[Category:Military sports]]\n[[Category:Combination events]]\n[[Category:Mixed-sex sports]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:FEI-recognized competition]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses|Event (disambiguation){{!}}Event}}\n{{Expand French|Concours complet d'\u00e9quitation|fa=yes|topic=sport|date=February 2015}}\n{{more citations needed|date=September 2013}}\n{{Infobox sport\n| name       = Eventing\n| image      = Badminton horse trials open ditch jump.jpg\n| alt        = \n| caption    = The cross-country phase of Eventing\n| union      = [[International Federation for Equestrian Sports]] (FEI)\n| nickname   = {{Flatlist|\n* Three-day eventing\n* horse trials\n* combined training\n}}\n| region     = Worldwide\n| registered = \n| clubs      = \n| contact    = No\n| team       = Individual and team at international levels\n| mgender    = Yes\n| type       = Outdoor\n| equipment  = {{Flatlist|\n* [[Horse]]\n* [[Horse tack]]\n* [[Horse jumping obstacles]]\n}}\n| venue      = {{Plainlist|\n* Arena (dressage and stadium jumping stages)\n* Cross-country, open terrain course\n}}\n| olympic    = [[Equestrian at the Summer Olympics|1912]]\n| paralympic =\n}}\n[[File:Zadinus - eventing training bij Tim Lips 25-06-2012.webm|thumb|eventing training]]\n\n'''Eventing''' (also known as '''three day eventing''' or '''horse trials''') is an [[equestrianism|equestrian]] event where a single horse and rider combine and compete against other competitors across the three disciplines of [[dressage]], [[cross-country equestrianism|cross-country]], and [[show jumping]]. This event has its roots in a comprehensive [[cavalry]] test that required mastery of several types of riding. The competition may be run as a '''one-day event''' ('''ODE'''), where all three events are completed in one day (dressage, followed by show jumping and then the cross-country phase) or a '''three-day event''' ('''3DE'''), which is more commonly now run over four days, with dressage on the first two days, followed by cross-country the next day and then show jumping in reverse order on the final day. Eventing was previously known as '''Combined Training''', and the name persists in many smaller organizations. The term \"Combined Training\" is sometimes confused with the term \"Combined Test\", which refers to a combination of just two of the phases, most commonly dressage and show jumping.\n\n==Phases==\nEventing is an equestrian [[triathlon]], in that it combines three different disciplines in one competition set out over one, two, or three days, depending on the length of courses and number of entries. This sport follows a similar format in Australia, Canada, Ireland, United Kingdom and the United States\n\n===Dressage===\n[[File:Pitt Shoulder.JPG|right|200px|thumb|[[William Fox-Pitt]] performing a [[half-pass]] in a dressage test at an event]]\n{{See also|Dressage}}\n\nThe [[dressage]] phase (held first) consists of an exact sequence of movements ridden in an enclosed arena (20\u00d760&nbsp;m for International 3DE but usually 20\u00d740&nbsp;m for ODE). The test is judged by one or more judges, who are looking for balance, rhythm, suppleness, and most importantly, the cooperation between the horse and rider. The challenge is to demonstrate that a supremely fit horse, capable of completing the cross-country phase on time, also has the training to perform in a graceful, relaxed, and precise manner. Dressage work is the basis of all the other phases and disciplines within the sport of eventing because it develops the strength and balance that allow a horse to go cross-country and show jump competently.\n\nAt the highest level of competition, the dressage test is roughly equivalent to the United States Dressage Federation Third Level and may ask for [[half-pass]] at trot, [[shoulder-in]], [[haunches-in|travers]], collected, medium and extended gaits, single [[flying change]]s, and [[counter-canter]]. The tests may ''not'' ask for [[Grand Prix Dressage|Grand Prix]] movements such as [[piaffe]], canter pirouette, or [[passage (dressage)|passage]].\n\nEach movement in the test is scored on a scale from 0 to 10, with a score of \"10\" being the highest possible mark and with the total maximum score for the test varying depending on the level of competition and the number of movements. A score of 10 is very rare. Therefore, if one movement is poorly executed, it is still possible for the rider to get a good overall score if the remaining movements are very well executed. The marks are added together and any errors of course deducted.  To convert this score to penalty points, the average marks of all judges are converted to a percentage of the maximum possible score, subtracted from 100 and the multiplied by a co-efficient decided by the governing body. Canadian example: 77 percent becomes 34.5 penalty points or (100 - 77) x 1.5 = 34.5\n* Once the bell rings the rider is allowed 45 seconds to enter the ring or receive a two-point penalty, then an additional 45 seconds, for a total of 90 seconds, or is eliminated.<ref>https://files.usef.org/assets/j7nlXQg0tg4/13ev.pdf</ref>\n* If all four feet of the horse exit the arena during the test, this results in elimination.\n* If the horse resists more than 20 seconds during the test, this results in elimination.\n* If the rider falls, this results in elimination. \n* Errors on course:\n** 1st: minus 2 marks\n** 2nd: minus 4 marks\n** 3rd: elimination\n\n===Cross-country===\n[[Image:454 Paul Sims on Sunny Boy.jpg|left|thumb|A rider on cross-country]]\nThe next phase, [[cross-country equestrianism|cross-country]], requires both horse and rider to be in excellent physical shape and to be brave and trusting of each other. This phase consists of approximately 12\u201320 fences (lower levels), or 30\u201340 at the higher levels, placed on a long outdoor circuit. These fences consist of very solidly built natural objects (logs, stone walls, etc.) as well as various obstacles such as [[water (obstacle)|ponds and streams]], ditches, [[bank (obstacle)|drops and banks]], and [[Combination (jump)|combinations]] including several jumping efforts based on objects that would commonly occur in the countryside. Sometimes, particularly at higher levels, fences are designed that would not normally occur in nature. However, these are still designed to be as solid as more natural obstacles. Safety regulations mean that some obstacles are now being built with a \"frangible pin system\", allowing part or all of the jump to collapse if hit with enough impact. Speed is also a factor, with the rider required to cross the finish line within a certain time frame (optimum time). Crossing the finish line after the optimum time results in penalties for each second over.  At lower levels, there is also a speed fault time, where penalties are incurred for horse and rider pairs completing the course too quickly. For every \"disobedience\" (refusal or run-out of a jump) a horse and rider incur on course, penalties will be added to their dressage score. After four disobediences altogether or three disobediences at one fence the pair is eliminated, meaning they can no longer participate in the competition. A horse and rider pair can also be eliminated for going off course, for example missing a fence. If the horses shoulder and hind-quarter touch the ground, mandatory retirement is taken and they are not allowed to participate further in the competition. If the rider falls off the horse they are eliminated. However, in the US this rule is currently being revised for the Novice level and below. The penalties for disobediences on cross-country are weighted severely relative to the other phases of competition to emphasize the importance of courage, endurance, and athleticism. Fitness is required as the time allowed will require a strong canter at the lower levels, all the way to a strong gallop at the higher events.\n\nIn recent years, a controversy has developed between supporters of short and long format three-day events.  Traditionally, three-day events had dressage, endurance, and show jumping. Endurance day consisted of 4 phases: A, B, C and D.  Phases A and C were roads and tracks, with A being a medium-paced warm up to prepare the horse and rider for Phase B, a steeplechase format at an extremely fast pace over steeplechase-style fences.  Phase C was a slow-paced cool down coming off of phase B, in preparation for the toughest and most demanding phase, D, or cross-country.  Before embarking on phase D, in the \"ten-minute box\", horses had to be approved to continue by a [[veterinary physician|vet]], who monitored their temperature and [[circulatory system of the horse|heart rate]], ensuring that the horse was sound and fit.\n\nThree day events are now offered in the classic format, with endurance day, or short-format, with no steeplechase (phase B) or roads and tracks (phases A and C).  The 2004 Olympic Summer Games in Athens, Greece chose the short format, due to lack of facilities, time and financing, which sparked a large debate in the eventing community whether to keep the steeplechase phase or just offer cross-country. Today, most events are run short-format. In the United States the \"classic format\" remains a popular option for the Novice, and Training levels of competition at select events.\n\nIn 2008, the rules regarding safety in the sport were changed. One change stated that a fall anywhere during the cross-country phase resulted in elimination, even if the rider was galloping on course and not approaching a jump, or in the middle of a combination.\n\n==== Scoring ====\n[[Image:Tim price vortex refusal dairy mounds burghley 2009.jpg|thumb|right|Tim Price does well to stay on as Vortex refuses at the Dairy Mounds during the cross-country phase of Burghley Horse Trials 2009.]]\n* [[Refusal (horse)|Refusal]], run-out, or circle:\n** At the same obstacle:\n*** First: 20 penalties\n*** Second: 40 penalties\n*** 20 penalties at each question\n** In the round (for instance one refusal at each of several different obstacles):\n*** Third (used to be fourth refusal, and still is for lower national levels in some countries only): elimination (E)\n* Fall of rider: elimination (E)\n* Fall of horse (shoulder and hind touch the ground): elimination (E)\n* Exceeding the time:\n** Optimum: 0.4 penalties per second\n** Limit (twice the optimum): elimination (E)\n* Coming in under speed fault time: 1 penalties per second (lower national levels in some countries only)\n\n==== Other faults ====\n* Competing with improper saddlery: elimination (E)\n* Jumping without headgear or a properly fastened harness: elimination (E)\n* Error of course not rectified: elimination (E)\n* Omission of obstacle: elimination (E)\n* Jumping an obstacle in the wrong order or direction: elimination (E)\n* Retaking an obstacle already jumped: elimination (E)\n* Dangerous riding, at determination of the ground jury: elimination (usually with a warning first) (E)\n* Failure to wear medical armband: elimination (at discretion of ground jury) (E)\n* 4 refusals on whole course: elimination (E) (only in horse trails. If you are competing in FEI, you get 2 refusals and your third is elimination.)\n\n==== Types of obstacles ====\n{{Main|Cross-country equestrianism|Indoor cross-country|Horse jumping obstacles}}\n\n[[Image:3DE combinaison direct way.svg|right|thumb|200px|The \"direct route\" when jumping cross-country]]\n[[Image:3DE combinaison optional way.svg|right|thumb|200px|If the rider has a refusal at the direct route, he may jump the other B element without additional penalty than incurred for the refusal.]] \nA combination is always considered one obstacle, and the various elements within the combination are lettered \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", and so on. In cross-country, the rider need only retake the element they refused rather than the whole complex. So a refusal at element B does not require them to jump A again. However, they have the option of retaking the previous elements if they wish. For example, in a bounce type obstacle it may be physically impossible to approach B without first clearing A. Yet for some in and outs, you can go to B and not have to rejump A.\n\nMany cross-country obstacles have several possible routes to take (for example, at obstacle 5 there may be 2 A, 2 B, and 2 C elements), with one route usually being faster but requiring a more skillful ride or more physical effort from the horse. A rider may take any of the possible routes as long as they pass over each letter once. Additionally, after a refusal, they may jump a different obstacle of the same letter in place of the original.\n\nA refusal at A is a first refusal, and would receive 20 penalties. Whether the rider retakes A or not, a subsequent refusal at B is a second refusal and so on. Three refusals at any one obstacle results in elimination, as does 4 refusals on the entire course.\n\n====Ten Minute Box====\n\nThe \"Ten Minute Box\" is a compulsory halt included during the cross-country section of a three-day event after the roads and tracks and steeplechase phases and before the \"pure\" cross-country jumping phase. It is a pause designed to allow the horse (and rider!) time to cool off, rest and stabilize its vitals and ensure that it is prepared for the \"pure\" cross-country phase. In the Ten Minute Box, riders and assistants will cool the horse down, walk the horse around and check tack and studs and a veterinarian will inspect the horse - including checking its heart and respiration rates - to determine if it is fit to compete in the final \"pure\" cross-country phase.\n\n===Stadium jumping===\n[[Image:RolexFence1.JPG|thumb|Show jumping phase at the Land Rover Kentucky Three Day Event]]\n{{Main|Show jumping}}\n\nStadium or show jumping is the final phase of eventing competition and tests the technical jumping skills of the horse and rider, including suppleness, obedience, fitness, and athleticism. In this phase, 12\u201320 fences are set up in a ring. These fences are typically brightly colored and consist of elements that can be knocked down, unlike cross-country obstacles. This phase is also timed, with penalties being given for every second over the required time. In addition to normal jumping skills, eventing show jumping tests the fitness and stamina of the horse and rider, generally being held after the cross-country phase in higher level and international events.\n\n==== Scoring ====\n* Knocking down an obstacle: 4 penalties\n* Disobedience (refusal, run-out, circle, moving backwards) over the whole round:\n** First: 4 penalties\n** Second:  Elimination\n* Fall of rider: Elimination\n* Fall of horse: Elimination\n* Exceeding the time allowed: 0.4 of a penalty per second\n* Jumping an obstacle in the wrong order: Elimination\n* Error of course not rectified: Elimination\n\nAn obstacle is defined as having been knocked down if any part of its height is lowered. It is therefore possible to knock out a pole below the top pole and receive no penalties, as long as the highest pole stays in place, so that the jump retains the same height. It does count as a knockdown if the highest pole falls out of one jump cup but remains in the other; although part of the pole remains at the original height, the other part is lowered.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Rules of Each Event Phase and How They Are Scored|url=http://www.britisheventing.com/section.asp?section=681&sectionTitle=The+Phases+explained|publisher=British Eventing|accessdate=15 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528130943/http://www.britisheventing.com/section.asp?section=681&sectionTitle=The+Phases+explained|archive-date=28 May 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Jumping Rules|url=http://www.fei.org/sites/default/files/file/OFFICIALS%20%26%20ORGANISERS/ORGANISERS/JUMPING/Technical%20Info/JumpRules_24thEd_2013_clean_1.pdf|publisher=F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Equestre Internationale|accessdate=15 December 2012}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe winner is the horse and rider with the fewest penalties. Awards are usually presented while mounted, before the placed riders take a lap of honor around the arena.\n\n==History==\n===Olympic beginning===\n{{See also|Equestrian at the Summer Olympics}}\nEventing competition that resembles the current three-day were first held in 1902, at the [[Championnat du Cheval d'Armes]] in [[France]], and was introduced into the [[Equestrian at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] starting [[Equestrian at the 1912 Summer Olympics|1912]] in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]. [[Dressage]] originally demonstrated the horse's ability to perform on the parade ground, where elegance and obedience were key. [[Cross-country equestrianism|Cross-country]] began as a test of stamina, courage, and bravery over difficult terrain, important for a [[wikt:charger#Noun|charger]] on long marches or if the horse was asked to carry a dispatch across country. The [[show jumping|stadium jumping]] phase sought to prove the horse's continuing soundness and fitness after the difficult cross-country day.\n\nThe Olympic eventing competition was originally open only to male military officers in active duty, mounted only on military charges. In 1924, the event was open to male civilians, although [[Non-commissioned officer|non-commissioned Army officers]] could not participate in the Olympics until 1956. Women were first allowed to take part in 1964; equestrian sports are one of the few Olympic sports in which men and women compete against one another.\n\n===Format===\nThe original format, used in the [[Equestrian at the 1912 Summer Olympics \u2013 Individual eventing|1912 Olympics]], was spread over several days:\n*'''Day 1''': Endurance test comprising {{convert|55|km|mi|abbr=on}} (with a time allowed of 4 hours, giving a speed of approx. 230 meters per minute) immediately followed by {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} of a flagged cross-country course at a speed of 333 meters per minute. Time penalties were given for exceeding the time allowed, but no bonus points were given for being fast.\n*'''Day 2''': Rest day\n*'''Day 3''': [[steeplechase (horse racing)|Steeplechase]] test of {{convert|3.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} with 10 plain obstacles, at a speed of 600 mpm, with time penalties but no time bonus points\n*'''Day 4''': Jumping test (\"prize jumping\"), which was considered easy by most of the spectators\n*'''Day 5''': Dressage test (\"prize riding\")\n\nThe [[1924 Summer Olympics|Paris Games]] in 1924 introduced a format very similar to the one of today: with day 1 dressage, day 2 the endurance test, and day 3 the jumping test. The endurance test has changed the most since that time. Originally, bonus points could be earned for a fast ride cross-country (less than the optimum time). This helped competitors make up for a poor dressage ride, with a clean, fast cross-country ride. This system, however, was dropped in 1971. The format for the endurance test occurred as below:\n\n*'''Phase A''': Short roads and tracks (with five penalties per 5 seconds over time)\n*'''Phase B''': Steeplechase, decreased in speed from 600 mpm to 550 mpm (with 10 penalties added per 5 seconds over the time, 3 bonus points per 5 seconds under time)\n*'''Phase C''': Long roads and tracks (with 5 penalties per 5 seconds over time)\n*'''Compulsory Halt''' (now the 10-minute halt)\n*'''Phase D''': Cross-country (with 10 penalties added per 5 seconds over the time, 3 bonus points per 10 seconds under time)\n*'''Phase E''': 1.25 mile run on the flat (with 5 penalties per 5 seconds over time).\n\n(Note: Phase E was abolished in 1967.)\n\nIn 1963, the 10-minute halt was introduced, to occur after the completion of phases A, B, and C. It took place in a marked out area (the 10-minute box), where the horse was checked by two judges and one veterinary official who would make sure the horse was fit to continue onto phase D. If the horse was unfit, the panel would pull it from the competition.\n\nThe format of the sport underwent major changes in 2004 and 2005, with the creation of the \"short\" or \"modified format\", which excluded phases A, B, and C from endurance day. The primary reason for excluding these phases was that the Olympic Committee was considering dropping the sport of eventing from the Olympics because of the cost and large area required for the speed and endurance phase with a steeplechase course and several miles of roads-and-tracks. To prevent the elimination of the sport from the Olympics program, the \"short format\" was developed by the FEI. The last Olympic Games that included the long, or \"classic\", three-day format was the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney, while [[Rolex Kentucky Three Day|Rolex Kentucky]], the [[Badminton Horse Trials]], and [[Burghley Horse Trials]] ran their last long format three-day in 2005. The short format is now the standard for international competition, such as the Olympics and [[World Equestrian Games]].\n\nThe change in format has brought about controversy. Some riders support the continuation of the classic format, believing it is the \"true test of horse and rider\". Others believe the classic format is superior because it teaches horsemanship, due to the extra preparation needed to condition the horse and the care required after the several miles of endurance day. However, others prefer the short format, as they believe it saves wear-and-tear on their horses and allows the horse not only to compete in more three-day events each season, but decreases the chance of injury to the horse. However, this claim has not held true in several recent studies that compared injuries sustained in classic and in short format competitions over equivalent courses.  Further, some research indicates that horses are more stressed by the short format than by the careful warm-up inherent in the classic format.  Regardless, many upper-level riders prepare their horses for the short format using the same conditioning and training as for the long format. The short format has also been widely urged by breeders of heavier, warmblood-type horses. The long format has remained popular at the Novice and Training levels in the United States, and with riders who feel it maximizes horsemanship.\n\n===Veterinary inspection, or \"trot up\"/\"horse inspection\"===\nBefore the beginning of a three-day event, and also before the last phase, horses are inspected by a vet to ensure that they are fit to compete further. It is usually a formal affair, with well-groomed and braided horses, and nicely dressed riders. It is also a very nerve-wracking time, as the \"pass\" or \"fail\" determines whether the horse may continue with the competition. A vet can request that a horse be sent to the holding box, where it will then be re-assessed before being allowed to continue.  In upper level FEI classes, a second veterinarian (often called the Associate FEI Veterinarian) may inspect horses sent to the hold box and make the decision to pass or fail a horse.  This practice is in place so that no one veterinarian has complete power to eliminate a horse and allows for a large number of horses to be evaluated in a timely manner.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fei.org/sites/default/files/FINALVeterinary%20Regulations%20proposed%20changes%20for%202012_6_.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-20 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130429093745/http://www.fei.org/sites/default/files/FINALVeterinary%20Regulations%20proposed%20changes%20for%202012_6_.pdf |archivedate=2013-04-29 |df= }}</ref>\n\nIn lower levels of competition, the horse's movement may be analyzed as they finish the cross-country, where they will be asked to trot briefly after crossing the finishing line to satisfy the vet of their soundness.\n\n===Penalty point system===\nIn 1971, the penalty point system was first introduced into eventing. This system converts the dressage score and all jump penalties on cross-country and show jumping into penalty points, with the horse and rider with the fewest points winning the event. Different weight is given for each phase, with the cross-country \u2014 the heart of eventing \u2014 being the most important, followed by the dressage and then the show jumping. The intended ratio of cross-country:dressage:show jumping is theoretically 12:3:1. Therefore, an error in cross-country counts heavily. This prevents horses that are simply good in dressage (for example) from winning the event with a poor cross-country test.\n\nIn 1971, the following penalty system was instituted:\n*'''Phase A and C''': 1 penalty per second over the optimum time\n*'''Phase B''': 0.8 penalties per second over\n*'''Phase D''': 0.4 penalties per second over\n\nIn 1977, the dressage scoring was changed, with each movement marked out of ten rather than out of six. This increased the maximum number of dressage marks from 144 to 240. This number later increased to 250 marks in 1998, after additional movements were added. To keep the correct weight, a formula is used to convert good marks in dressage to penalty points. First, the marks of the judges (if there is more than one) are averaged. Then the raw mark is subtracted from the maximum points possible. This number is then multiplied by 0.6 to calculate the final penalty score.\n\nShow jumping rules were also changed in 1977, with a knock-down or a foot in the water awarded only 5 penalties rather than 10. This prevented the show jumping phase from carrying too much weight, again, to keep the ratio between the phases correct.\n\n====Current scoring====\nThe dressage score is converted to a percentage and the penalty points calculated by subtracting the percentage from 100. This is rounded to 1 decimal digit.<ref>{{cite book |title=Eventing Rules 25th Edition effective 1st January 2019 |date=3 December 2018 |publisher=F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Equestre Internationale |location=Switzerland |pages=62\u201363}}</ref>\n\nIn cross country, penalty points are awarded for jumping errors and for time.<ref>{{cite book |title=Eventing Rules 25th Edition effective 1st January 2019 |date=3 December 2018 |publisher=F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Equestre Internationale |location=Switzerland |page=69}}</ref> In the jumping, 20 penalty points are awarded for a first refusal at an obstacle and 40 penalty points for a second refusal (the rider is eliminated on their third refusal). Two refusals at different obstacles each attract 20 penalty points. If a horse jumps an obstacle, but the body of the horse does not pass completely between the flags, 15 penalty points are awarded, only if the horse would have cleared the obstacle's height had it been better positioned. If a horse activates an obstacle's [[frangible device]], 11 penalty points are awarded.\n\nTime penalties<ref>{{cite book |title=Eventing Rules 25th Edition effective 1st January 2019 |date=3 December 2018 |publisher=F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Equestre Internationale |location=Switzerland |page=69}}</ref> are awarded for being too slow over the optimum time at a rate of 0.4 penalty points per second over this time up to the time limit (twice the optimum time) at which point the competitor is eliminated. Some national bodies implement a fastest time allowed for lower grades where more inexperienced riders compete. The fastest time allowed can range from 20 seconds to 45 seconds faster than the optimum time. Typically, penalty points are awarded at a rate of 1 per second faster than this time.\n\nIn the show jumping test,<ref>{{cite book |title=Eventing Rules 25th Edition effective 1st January 2019 |date=3 December 2018 |publisher=F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Equestre Internationale |location=Switzerland |pages=72\u201373}}</ref> either knocking down of the obstacle or refusing to jump the obstacle attracts 4 penalty points. In the case of a knock, riders are permitted to continue to the next obstacle. However, if the obstacle was refused, it must be reattempted. A second refusal at the same obstacle results in elimination. Similarly to the cross country, time penalty points are awarded at a rate of 0.4 penalty points per second commenced over the optimum time.\n\n===Non-Olympic competition===\nIn its early days, the sport was most popular in Britain, and the British gave the competition a new name, the \"Three-Day Event\", due to the three-day time span of the competition. In America, the sport was also called \"combined training\", due to the three different disciplines and types of training methods needed for the horse.  In the [[United Kingdom]], \"combined training\" competition includes only the dressage and show jumping phases.\n\nIn between a 'combined training' and a 'horse trial', there are also 'short courses'. Short courses consist of a dressage phase and a jumping phase. The jumping phase usually starts in the stadium ring with a fence leading out to a smaller field with some cross-country fences (not as many as in a horse trial's cross-country phase). The rider will then jump back into the stadium ring to finish his or her course.\n\nThe first annual, Olympic-level event developed was the [[Badminton Horse Trials]], held each year in England. First held in 1949, the Badminton event was created after a poor performance by the British Eventing Team at the 1948 Olympic Games, with the purpose of being a high-class preparation event, and as extra exposure for the military horses, who very rarely had the chance to compete. Initially, only British riders were allowed to compete (although women were allowed, despite being banned from riding in the Olympics), but the competition is now an international open to all riders from around the world who have qualified for this level of competition.  Along with Burghley and Kentucky, Badminton is one of the most prestigious events to win in the world.  Currently, the Olympic event is considered a CCI****, a rank lower than Badminton which is a CCI*****.\n\nThe second three-day competition to be held at Olympic level each year was the [[Burghley Horse Trials]], first held in 1961. Burghley is the longest running international event.\n\nThe first CCI held outside of Britain on an annual basis is the [[Rolex Kentucky Three Day]], held each year in Lexington since 1978.\n\n===Importance of dressage training===\nIn the early years, the dressage phase was fairly inconsequential in determining the final standings. It was quite possible for a horse to have a terrible dressage test, then run a clean cross-country and show jumping, and still finish near the top of the standings. Since then, correct dressage training has become increasingly important should a horse and rider wish to be placed (complete all sections and finish in the top 12). This can be traced back to [[Sheila Willcox]], who took a particular interest in dressage, becoming abundantly clear when she won Badminton three years running in the 1950s. She had a strong influence on [[Mary King (equestrian)|Mary King]] and [[Lucinda Green]] amongst others.\n\nAfter the 2000 Olympic Games, the [[International Federation for Equestrian Sports|FEI]] hired British eventer and dressage rider [[Christopher Bartle]] to write new dressage tests for the upper-level events, which would include a greater deal of collection. This has since raised the standard even further in the dressage phase.\n\nAdditionally, the cross-country phase has become more technical, asking the horse to be adjustable and supple through [[Combination (jump)|combinations]]. A horse can no longer just be brave and athletic but must have a good deal of dressage training should his rider wish to successfully negotiate odd distances or bending lines at a gallop.  Also, in show jumping, a horse is asked to move with impulsion and engagement; this makes the jump more fluent, brings the horse to [[Bascule_(horse)]] more correctly, and is less jarring for both horse and rider.\n\n===Safety===\nBetween 1997 and December 2008, at least 37 eventing riders died as a result of injuries incurred while competing in the cross-country phase of eventing at national or international level or at Pony Club. Of these, 18 riders died in the period 2006\u20132008. These 37 fatal falls have been at all levels of the sport, from domestic one-day events up to regional championships level, and they have occurred in most of the recognized eventing countries around the world, with concentrations in the United Kingdom (14) and the United States (8). At least 25 of these 37 deaths have resulted from a somersaulting (rotational) fall of the horse, with 11 of the 16 deaths in 2007 and 2008 being reported as having resulted from [[rotational falls]].&nbsp;<ref name=Horsetalk081219>Horsetalk \u2013 [http://www.horsetalk.co.nz/saferide/131-eventingincrisis.shtml Eventing in crisis?] 19 December 2008</ref>\n\nInformation about horse fatalities is difficult to locate, but at least 19 eventing horses, many of them top-level performers, died in 2007 and 2008, most of them in the US.&nbsp;<ref name=Horsetalk081219 />\n\nOver time, course design has become increasingly more focused on the safety of the horse and rider. Fences are built more solidly than in the earlier days, encouraging a bold jump from the horse, which actually helps prevent falls. The layout of the course and the build of the obstacles encourage the horse to have a successful run. This includes greater use of precision fences, such as [[corner (fence)|corner]]s and \"skinny jumps\", that are very good tests of the rider's ability and the horse's training but allow the horse to simply run around the jump if the rider misjudges it. Safety measures such as filling in the area between corner-shaped jumps on cross-country or rails of a fence help prevent the entrapment of the legs of the horse decrease the number of serious falls or injuries.\n\nThe newest improvement in cross-country safety is the ''frangible'' fence, which uses a pin and other techniques which allow the fence to \"break or fall\" in a controlled manner to minimize the risk of injury to horse and rider. This can help to prevent the most dangerous situation on cross-country, when the horse hits a solid fence between the forearm and chest, and somersaults over ([[Rotational falls|rotational fall]]), sometimes falling on the rider. This type of fall has caused the deaths of several riders and horses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eventingsafety.wordpress.com/|title=Eventing Safety and Risk Management|author=|date=|website=Eventing Safety and Risk Management|accessdate=26 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nLeg protection for horses has also improved. Very little was used in the early days, even on cross-country. Leg protection is now seen on nearly every horse at all levels. Boots have increased technologically, and include materials that either help absorb shock or are very hard and strong to prevent a serious injury.\n\nRules protecting riders have improved as well. Riders are now required to wear a safety vest (body protector) during cross-country, as well as an [[ASTM]]/[[Safety Equipment Institute|SEI]] or [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] approved [[equestrian helmet]] equipped with a retention harness,<ref>[http://www.equisearch.com/horses_riding_training/tack_apparel/english/safety100703/ Barakat, Christine. \"Riding Helmet Safety Standards Explained\" ''Equisearch''.

Eventing was one of the first sports to require the use of a helmet with harness when jumping. As of 2010, more riders were wearing [[air bag vest]]s, which automatically inflate if a rider falls off the horse.<ref>Thomas, Katie.

Accessed August 25, 2010.</ref>\n\n===Weight rule===\nFrom the beginning, event horses had to carry a minimum weight of {{convert|165|lb|abbr=on}} (including rider and saddle) during the endurance test, since military horses were expected to be able to carry such weight. Lead weights were carried on the saddle, and the competitor had to be weighed-in with tack immediately following cross-country. The weight was reduced to {{convert|154|lb|abbr=on}} for the 1996 Olympic Games, after a study demonstrated that both the horse's arc over a fence became shallower and the leading leg took a great deal of extra force on landing when the horse was carrying dead weight than when free from the burden. The rule was eventually abolished January 1, 1998. By removing this rule, the stress on the joints and soft-tissue, as well as the chance of a fall, were decreased.<ref>Bryant, Jennifer O.

[[Concours Complet International|CCI]] (Concours Complet International, or International Complete Contest) is one such category and defines a three-day event that is open to competitors from any foreign nation as well as the host nation.\n\n*[[Concours Complet International|CCI]] : International Three-day event (Concours Complet International)\n*CIC: International One-day event (Concours International Combin\u00e9)\n*CCIO: International Team Competitions (Concours Complet International Officiel). Includes the Olympics, the [[Eventing World Championship|World Championships]], the Pan Am Games, and other continental championships\n\nThe levels of international events are identified by the number of stars next to the category; there are four levels in total. A CCI* is for horses that are just being introduced to international competition. A CCI** is geared for horses that have some experience of international competition. CCI*** is the advanced level of competition.\n\nThe very highest level of competition is the CCI****, and with only six such competitions in the world ([[Badminton Horse Trials|Badminton]], [[Burghley Horse Trials|Burghley]], [[Kentucky Three-Day Event|Kentucky]], [[Australian International Three Day Event|Adelaide]], [[Luhmuhlen Horse Trials]], and the [[\u00c9toiles de Pau|Stars of Pau]]) it is the ultimate aim of many riders. The [[Eventing World Championship|World Championships]] are also considered CCI****. Rolex offer a financial prize for any rider who can win three of the biggest competitions in succession. These are Badminton, Burghley and Kentucky. So far, Pippa Funnell (Great Britain) and Michael Jung (Germany) are the only riders to do this. Andrew Hoy did come close, however, and in 2010 [[Oliver Townend]] was competing for this coveted \"Grand Slam\" at Rolex Kentucky when he suffered a fall at obstacle #20 which eliminated him from competition.\n\nOne, two and three-star competitions are roughly comparable to the Novice, Intermediate and Advanced levels of British domestic competition, respectively, and to the Preliminary, Intermediate, and Advanced levels of American domestic competition, respectively.\n\n==National competition==\nEventing rules and the recognized levels in various nations are similar, but not always identical.  While rules usually follow the FEI to some degree, history and tradition of various nations has also influenced competition rules within a given country.\n\nIn addition to recognized events that prepare the best riders for international competition, many nations also offer eventing for beginner, youth, and amateur riders through organizations such as [[Pony Club]], [[4-H]] or other riding clubs, where most riders begin their competitive careers.  At the most elementary levels, fence heights begin at around 18&nbsp;inches to {{convert|2|ft|m|abbr=on}}.\n\n===Australia===\nIn Australia, where [[Equestrian Australia]] governs eventing competition, the levels are as follows:\n* Encouragers: XC:  fences maximum height 0.45m 375 m/min; Stadium fences: 0.45m\n* Newcomers: XC:  fences maximum height 0.60m 350 m/min; Stadium fences: 0.60m\n* Introductory: XC: fences maximum height 0.80 m ditch 1.40 m drops 1.0 m 400 m/min; Stadium fences: 0.8 m\n* Preliminary: XC: fences maximum height 0.95 m ditch 2.00 m drops 1.2 m 450 m/min; Stadium fences: 0.95 m\n* Pre Novice: XC: fences maximum height 1.05 m ditch 2.40 m drops 1.4, 500 m/min; Stadium fences: 1.05 m\n* 1 Star: XC: fences maximum height 1.10 m ditch 2.80 m drops 1.6 m 520 m/min; Stadium fences: 1.15 m\n* 2 Star: XC: fences maximum height 1.15 m ditch 3.20 m drops 1.8 m 550 m/min; Stadium fences: 1.20 m\n* 3 Star: XC: fences maximum height 1.20 m ditch 3.60 m drops 2.0 m 570 m/min; Stadium fences: 1.25 m\n\nThe Sydney International Three Day Event is a main qualification event in [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]] for eventing in Australia.<ref>\n* {{cite web |url=http://horsezone.com.au/news/only-4-weeks-to-go-until-sydney-international-three-day-event-2396/#l4XgDF1pYKIDRX8B.97 |title=Only 4 Weeks to Go until Sydney International Three Day Event |publisher=Horsezone |access-date=18 July 2017}}\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/teenager-dies-while-competing-in-the-sydney-international-horse-trials-20160430-goivgz.html |title=Teenager dies while competing in the Sydney International Horse Trials |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |publisher=FairfaxMedia |access-date=18 July 2017 |date=1 May 2016 |first1=Daisy |last1=Dumas |first2=Georgina |last2=Mitchell |first3=Emily |last3=Woods |first4=Melanie |last4=Kembrey}}\n</ref>\n\n===Canada===\nThe Canadian levels, under the rules of [[Equine Canada]], are as follows:\n* Pre-Entry XC: fences maximum height .75 m no drops, no mandatory water.

Stadium fences {{convert|4|ft|1|in|m|abbr=on}}, 13\u201315 efforts.\n\nIt is also common to see inter-levels (such as the Intermediate/Preliminary, or IP), which help riders transition between levels by using the dressage and show jumping tests of the higher level and the cross-country course of the lower, and starter levels, which use the dressage test and stadium course standards of the lower CT levels (e.g., Amoeba, Tadpole, Green as Grass) with a very simple cross-country course. However, the starter levels are considered \"test\" levels and thus do not have a consistent standard (or a national points system and leaderboard).\n\n==Horse==\nIn the lower levels, it is possible for any [[list of horse breeds|breed of horse]], if it has the talent for it, to do well in eventing.  [[Thoroughbred]]s and part-Thoroughbreds currently dominate the sport at the top levels because of their stamina and athletic ability, although many [[warmblood]]s and warmblood-thoroughbred crosses also do well. In the UK, [[Irish Horse|Irish sport horses]] have been popular for many years.\n\nBecause larger horses are favored, animals with some [[draft horse]] breeding are also seen, notably the [[Irish Draught]] and [[Clydesdale horse|Clydesdale]] crossbreds.  However, smaller horses can also excel; for example, the third place competitor in the 2007 [[Rolex Kentucky Three Day]] CCI competition was [[Theodore O'Connor]], a {{hands|14.1}} gelding that was a cross of Thoroughbred, [[Arabian horse|Arabian]] and [[Shetland pony]] breeding.<ref>\"Karen O'Connor and 'The Pony' Theodore O'Connor Wow The Crowd, Finishing Third\"  Accessed June 21, 2007 at http://www.horsesdaily.com/news/eventing/2007/07rolex/04-29-oconnor.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827152504/http://horsesdaily.com/news/eventing/2007/07rolex/04-29-oconnor.html |date=2016-08-27 }}</ref>\n\nAn event horse must be very responsive to succeed, as a horse that will not listen to a rider on the cross-country phase may end up taking a fall at a jump. The horse should be calm and submissive for the dressage phase, with good training on the flat. For cross-country, the horse must be brave, athletic, and (especially at the higher levels) fast with a good galloping stride and great stamina. The horse does not have to possess perfect jumping form, but should be safe over fences and have good scope. The best event horses are careful over jumps, as those who are not tend to have stadium rails knocked down on the last day. The horse also needs to have sound [[horse conformation|conformation]] and good [[horse hoof|feet]].\n\n==Riding attire==\nRiding attire is different in each of the three phases.  Dressage and stadium jumping feature the traditional turnout for each of those disciplines, requiring conservative attire. However, as of 2017 lower level divisions in the United States allow for more flexibility in the rider's attire. Cross-country attire and equipment emphasizes and requires safety protocols be followed, but has less formal appearance, with many riders wearing clothing of personalized, often bright colors. Under FEI rules, civilian riders may opt to wear the uniform of their riding club, and members of the military and national studs are required to wear service dress in the dressage and stadium jumping phases.<ref name=\"FEI 2013 Eventing Rules\">{{cite book|title=FEI Eventing Rules 24th Edition|year=2013|publisher=International Equestrian Federation|location=Lausanne, Switzerland|page=54|url=http://fei.org/sites/default/files/2013_Eventing_Rules_Final_March_changes_integrated.pdf|access-date=2013-09-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004215507/http://fei.org/sites/default/files/2013_Eventing_Rules_Final_March_changes_integrated.pdf|archive-date=2013-10-04|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref>\n\n===Dressage===\nFor the intermediate and advanced levels, riders usually wear dressage attire similar to that of [[Grand Prix Dressage]], including a [[top hat]] and white [[riding breeches]]. However, even at the most senior levels (e.g., the World Equestrian Games, the Olympics, and CCI****) the actual FEI dress requirements are less strict, requiring only \"hunting dress\"; a white shirt and a tie of any kind; gloves of any colour; white, fawn, or cream breeches; and [[riding boots]] of any colour.<ref name=\"FEI 2013 Eventing Rules\" /> The wearing of [[shadbelly]] or other tailcoat jackets is not compulsory in the dressage phase.<ref name=\"FEI 2013 Eventing Rules\" />\n\nRules at non-FEI competition vary.  In the  USA, formal attire is not required if all phases run in one day or for the lower levels.<ref name=\"2013 USEF Eventing Rules\">{{cite book|url=https://www.usef.org/forms-pubs/KlV5P9prkmM/ev-eventing-division|title=USEF Rules for Eventing|last=|first=|publisher=United States Equestrian Federation|year=2013|isbn=|location=Lexington, KY, United States|page=|pages=}}</ref> Though navy and black coats are the preferred traditional style, riders may wear any conservatively colored dark  or tweed hunting coat with a white shirt and choker or, preferably, a stock tie with pin.  If a rider wishes to stay within traditional requirements for higher-level competition, breeches should be white, fawn, or cream.  A black or navy hunt cap or [[derby]] hat may be worn, although many riders use an [[equestrian helmet]], which are considered safer.<ref name=\"2013 USEF Eventing Rules\"/>  Helmets are compulsory at lower levels.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nBoots may be field or dress style, black or brown in color.<ref name=\"2013 USEF Eventing Rules\"/>  Gloves and spurs give a polished appearance but are not required at lower levels. Dressage gloves are traditionally white, although other colors are permitted. [[Spur]]s, when worn, are restricted to certain lengths and types. [[Riding boots]] such as field or dress tall boots are usually black.\n\n===Cross-country===\n[[Image:R3DE XCountry.JPG|right|thumb|Attire in the cross-country phase is the least formal, and many riders choose \"eventing colours\", to which they match some of their horse's tack.]] The rider is required to wear a body protector vest, an approved [[equestrian helmet]] which must be properly fastened at all times when jumping, and a medical armband, containing the rider's medical history, allowing access to the information should the rider fall, be knocked unconscious, and require medical treatment.\n\nFEI rules<ref>{{cite book |title=Eventing Rules |date=3 December 2018 |publisher=F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Equestre Internationale |location=Switzerland |page=56 |edition=25th}}</ref> allow riders to dress as they please in the cross-country phase. Light-weight rugby or polo shirts are the most commonly worn shirt style, usually without a stock or tie.  Riding coats are generally not worn. Many riders wear a stop-watch to track their time so that they may adjust their speed to come in as close as possible to the optimum time.\n\n===Stadium jumping===\nEventing riders tend to follow the dress practices of showjumpers in the stadium jumping phase.  However,  FEI rules only require \"hunting dress\"; white shirt and tie of any kind; white, fawn, or cream breeches; and boots of any kind.<ref name=\"FEI 2013 Eventing Rules\" />\n \nIn most nations' nationally sanctioned competitions, and often even at lower levels, a protective [[equestrian helmet]] with harness is required, and a short hunt coat is traditional, except when weather is unreasonably warm, when, at the discretion of the technical delegate, jackets may be considered optional.  If helmet covers are used, they are required to be black or dark blue though some now include national colors where they are entitled to be worn.\n\n==Turnout of the horse and tack==\n\n===Turnout and grooming===\nEvent horses are turned out similarly to dressage horses, with the legs and face (muzzle, jaw, sides of ears, [[bridle path (horse)|bridle path]]) neatly clipped. The tail is usually \"banged\" (cut straight across), usually to a length between the fetlock joint and lower hock. Additionally, most event riders clip the sides of their mount's tails, to give them a finer appearance. The braiding of tails is fairly uncommon, probably because the tail can not be braided if the hairs along the sides of the dock are clipped.\n\nThe [[mane (horse)|mane]] is pulled to about 3 inches in length and is usually braided for dressage as well as the show jumping phase. However, most riders prefer to leave it loose for cross-country in case they need to grab it for security. Some riders also place [[quarter marks]] (decorative stenciling) on the hindquarters.\n\n===Tack===\n[[Image:Rolex XCountry.JPG|right|thumb|A horse on cross-country, showing the \"eventer's grease\" on his legs to help him slide over obstacles.]]\nMost event riders have a jumping saddle as well as a dressage saddle since each places them in a position better-suited for its purpose. At the lower levels, however, a rider can ride all three phases without difficulty in a well-fitted jumping saddle. At the upper levels, riders usually have a saddle specifically designed for cross-country, giving them more freedom for such fences as [[bank (obstacle)|banks and drops]].\n\nDressage tack is usually black in color, with a [[saddle blanket|white square pad]], giving a formal look. Except for the upper levels, where a [[double bridle]] is permitted, horses may only be ridden in [[snaffle bit]]s. There are strict guidelines as to what type of snaffle may be used, and the more severe types (such as any twisted bit) are prohibited. If a double bridle is used, a plain cavesson or crank [[noseband]] must be worn. With a snaffle bridle, the rider is also free to use the drop, flash, or grackle noseband, with the flash and plain cavesson being the most common. [[Breastplate (tack)|Breastplates]] are also fairly common in dressage at an event, despite the fact that they are not seen at regular dressage shows. Other forms of equipment, such as [[Martingale (tack)|martingale]]s, protective boots, gadgets/training devices, bit guards, [[polo wraps]], or tail wraps, are not allowed during the test.\n\n[[Image:R3DE StadiumJump.jpg|right|thumb|Horse and rider well turned-out for the stadium jumping phase. Note the rider wears a medical armband.]]\nIn show jumping, the rider uses a jumping saddle, usually with a square or fitted white pad. Rules on tack are less-stringent, and most forms of bridling and bitting are allowed, including the use of [[gag bit]]s, [[hackamore]]s, and any type of noseband. Breastplates and open front boots are usually worn. [[Martingale (tack)|Running martingales]] are also allowed, but must be used with rein stops. Standing and Irish martingales are not allowed.\n\nFor the cross-country phase, the rider usually uses similar tack as for the show jumping. However, cross-country boots are used for extra protection, to help prevent injury if they were to hit the solid obstacles. Most horses that wear shoes are also fitted with [[horse shoe studs]], to prevent slipping. At the upper levels, riders may also apply a grease or lard to the front of the horse's legs, to help the horse slide over fences if they hang a leg. Riders also tend to color-coordinate their cross-country tack to their colors. For example, using the same color saddle pad and tape for their boots, to match their shirt and protective vest.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Rotational falls]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons and category|Eventing|Eventing}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20091124084331/http://www.ponygalaxy.com/three-day-eventing/ Eventing Article on Pony Galaxy]\n* [http://www.fei.org/Disciplines/Eventing/ Eventing on the official site of the global governing body, the FEI]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070309121756/http://www.eventingusa.com/ United States Eventing Association]\n* [http://www.britisheventing.com British Eventing Association]\n* [http://eventingsafety.wordpress.com/ Eventing Safety & Risk Management]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20190514023639/https://www.eventingireland.com/ Eventing Ireland]\n* [http://www.eventingincanada.com/ Eventing In Canada]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070930064428/http://www.usriderfund.org/ USREF \u2013 The US non-profit organization that promotes safety and welfare in Eventing]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090201180450/http://www.eeicup.com/ Express Eventing \u2013 the new compact version of the sport]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100620015005/http://usef.org/_IFrames/breedsDisciplines/discipline/allEventing.aspx United States Equestrian Federation Eventing]\n\n{{Equestrian Sports}}\n{{Summer Olympic sports}}\n\n[[Category:Eventing| ]]\n[[Category:Summer Olympic disciplines]]\n[[Category:Military sports]]\n[[Category:Combination events]]\n[[Category:Mixed-sex sports]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:FEI-recognized competition]]\n", "name_user": "Megpellegrini", "label": "safe", "comment": "11 Point Frangible Device Rule", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventing"}

He took at least eight apprentices, including his nephew Charles Kemp (who became the master to Tom Tompion\u2019s nephew), John Farewell, and Joseph Antram, the latter of whom became a clockmaker to [[George I of Great Britain|King George I]]. The best known of Gretton\u2019s apprentices was [[Henry Sully]], who after completing his apprenticeship stayed with Gretton as a [[journeyman]] for four years rather than the more customary two years. Sully then moved to France, becoming quite famous in the Continent and in Great Britain.

Based on dating of his extant clocks and watches, it would seem that his workshop began producing watches in about 1673, followed by clocks in the mid-1670s. Gretton\u2019s peak production lasted about 25 years, from approximately 1685 until about 1710, when his output dropped significantly.<ref>Radage, Dennis, Meinen, Warner, and Radage, Laila. (2016).

However, Gretton maintained a strong relationship with the [[Worshipful Company of Clockmakers|Clockmakers\u2019 Company]] until the very last years of his life.\n\nGretton's earliest known extant watch dates to before 1675 and is on display at the [[British Museum]], London. The watch has crystals on both front and back, the back revealing the gilt brass top plate, which includes a subsidiary seconds dial, even though this is a pre-balance spring watch. Because of its complexity, this certainly would not have been Gretton's first watch.<ref>Radage, Dennis, Meinen, Warner, and Radage, Laila. (2016).

Many of the extant watches retain their boxes and cases; some of the makers of these items can be identified.\n\nGretton clocks were always of the highest quality, comparable to those of London's best makers. His early [[Grandfather clock|longcase clocks]] were housed in walnut cases. Later, the cases had [[parquetry]] decoration, followed by floral [[marquetry]], arabesque and then seaweed marquetry, [[ebony]]-veneered cases, and [[lacquer]]-decorated cases. He returned to walnut for his late longcase clocks.\n\nMost of Gretton\u2019s longcase movements had countwheel-[[Striking clock|striking]] control, although some had rack striking and quarter striking. Many early clocks had bolt-and-shutter [[maintaining power]].\n\nGretton's spring clocks were usually in an ebony-veneered or ebonized case with little or no decoration, other than the carrying handle. Gretton was, however, an early user of gilt basket-top cases. Most clocks originally stood on ebonized pad feet. Some peak-period spring clocks could be housed in a marquetry or [[Kingwood (wood)|kingwood]] case.\n\nAlmost all spring clocks employed rack striking. Gretton was an early adopter, if not the originator, of a strike/silent mechanism. Clocks employing this mechanism, but signed by at least one other maker (Hessenius), certainly originated from Gretton's workshop.<ref>Radage, Dennis, Meinen, Warner, and Radage, Laila. (2016). ''THROUGH THE GOLDEN AGE \u2013 Charles Gretton \u2013 Watch and Clockmaking''. pp. 279\u2013281.</ref> \n\nGretton was also an early adopter of mechanisms for silent-pull timepieces, several forms of which are known. Most Gretton spring clocks after about 1685 have a pull quarter repeat mechanism; several complex forms of this have been documented.<ref>Radage, Dennis, Meinen, Warner, and Radage, Laila. (2016).

He became a steward in 1684 and a warden in 1688, and he was elected Master of the Company in 1700.<ref>The Worshipful Company of Clockmakers: Court Minutes, 30 September 1700, MS2710/3.</ref>  Gretton continued his commitment to the Clockmakers\u2019 Company until his late years, when ill health likely prevented his direct participation. The Clockmakers\u2019 Company Court appointed Gretton to represent the Company as a proprietor with the [[Bank of England]] in 1714, and he held this position for several years.<ref>The Worshipful Company of Clockmakers: Court Minutes, 5 April 1714, MS2701/3.</ref>\n\n== Philanthropic Activities ==\nCharles Gretton became very successful in business and had the means to acquire wealth and a number of urban and rural properties. He had a keen interest in philanthropy, particularly relating to education. In 1701, he donated \u00a350 to the Clockmakers\u2019 Company to fund apprenticeships for orphaned sons of clockmakers.<ref>The Worshipful Company of Clockmakers: Court Minutes, 1 September 1701, MS2710/3.</ref> In 1704, the first boy started his apprenticeship with the help of this fund.

He also was a Common Councilman for the Ward of [[Farringdon Without]], representing the [[parish]] of St Dunstan-in-the-West for many years.\n\nHe served as a tax commissioner, and at times as an adjuster, for [[Ludgate]] and for both precincts of the parish of [[St Martin, Ludgate]].\n\n== Marriages ==\nCharles Gretton and Mary (n\u00e9e Phillips) married in 1678. They had ten children, only three of whom survived into adulthood. Mary Gretton died in December 1698, as did two of the children.\n\nTheir son Phillips attended [[St Paul's School, London|St Paul\u2019s School]], London, and [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], attaining his [[Doctor of Divinity]] degree at the latter.<ref>Gardiner, Robert (Ed.).

Phillips was married in the newly completed [[St Paul's Cathedral|St Paul\u2019s Cathedral]], London, in March 1712/13.\n\nDaughter Ann married John Houghton, a glover. Charles Gretton lived the very last years of his life with Ann at the Houghton home in [[Milk Street, London|Milk Street]], London. Ann was buried in Springfield in January 1752/53, where her nephew, Phillips' son, had become the rector.\n\nLittle is known about Thomas, the youngest son. He married Elizabeth Turner, a widow. The Ship was willed to Thomas, but \u00a310 of the yearly rent funded the charities in Claypole. Thomas was also buried in Springfield.\n\nCharles Gretton married Lucy Uffman in 1700, but she must have died, because Gretton was married again in 1711, this time to Dorothea Wilson. Gretton became a widower for the third time in 1727.\n\n== Death ==\nCharles Gretton died on 25 June 1731 and was buried at St Dunstan-in-the-West, Fleet Street, on 5 July 1731.

He took at least eight apprentices, including his nephew Charles Kemp (who became the master to Tom Tompion\u2019s nephew), John Farewell, and Joseph Antram, the latter of whom became a clockmaker to [[George I of Great Britain|King George I]]. The best known of Gretton\u2019s apprentices was [[Henry Sully]], who after completing his apprenticeship stayed with Gretton as a [[journeyman]] for four years rather than the more customary two years.

Based on dating of his extant clocks and watches, it would seem that his workshop began producing watches in about 1673, followed by clocks in the mid-1670s. Gretton\u2019s peak production lasted about 25 years, from approximately 1685 until about 1710, when his output dropped significantly.<ref>Radage, Dennis, Meinen, Warner, and Radage, Laila. (2016).

However, Gretton maintained a strong relationship with the [[Worshipful Company of Clockmakers|Clockmakers\u2019 Company]] until the very last years of his life.\n\nGretton's earliest known extant watch dates to before 1675 and is on display at the [[British Museum]], London. The watch has crystals on both front and back, the back revealing the gilt brass top plate, which includes a subsidiary seconds dial, even though this is a pre-balance spring watch. Because of its complexity, this certainly would not have been Gretton's first watch.<ref>Radage, Dennis, Meinen, Warner, and Radage, Laila. (2016).

This type of diligence has now been abolished after the enactment of the [[Abolition of Poindings and Warrant Sales Act 2001]].\n\nThere were two types of poinding:\n*'''''Personal''''' - The taking of [[movable property]] (e.g., wagons, livestock; but not property such as a house because it is not movable) belonging to the debtor. Plow cattle and tillage instruments cannot be included in times of labour or tilling, unless the debtor has no other movable property to satisfy the debt. '''''Personal poinding''''' is founded merely on an obligation to pay, all else aside. A relatively low level of [[Diligence (Scots law)|diligence]] is sufficient to accomplish this (such as [[letters of horning]], or a warrant granted by a sheriff or commissary).\n*'''''Real''''' - The confiscation of non-movable property (such as land) and the movable property found on it. Every ''debitum fundi'' (a debt using land as [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]]) is a foundation for '''''real poinding'''''. It cannot be used against movable property brought onto the land by a stranger, nor against the movable property of a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] for more than the value of the tenant's term rent.
