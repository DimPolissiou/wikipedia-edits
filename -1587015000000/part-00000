However, a fight occurs, resulting in Runeard's death and enraging the [[Classical element|elemental spirits]] of [[Earth (classical element)|Earth]], [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]], [[Water (classical element)|Water]], and [[Air (classical element)|Air]] of the forest. The spirits disappear and a wall of mist traps everyone in the Enchanted Forest. Young Agnarr barely escapes due to the help of an unknown savior.\n\nThree years after her coronation,{{efn|name=Timeline|As depicted in the 2013 film ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]''.}} Elsa celebrates autumn in the kingdom with Anna, [[Olaf (Frozen)|Olaf]] the snowman, [[Kristoff (Frozen)|Kristoff]] the ice harvester, and Kristoff's reindeer [[Sven (Frozen)|Sven]]. One night, when Elsa hears a mysterious voice [[Kulning|calling out]] to her, she follows it and unintentionally awakens the elemental spirits, which forces everyone in the kingdom to evacuate. Grand Pabbie and the Trolls colony arrive at Arendelle and Pabbie informs that they must set things right by discovering the truth about the kingdom's past.\n\nElsa, Anna, Olaf, Kristoff, and Sven embark to the Enchanted Forest, following the mysterious voice. After the mist parts at Elsa's touch, the Air spirit, in the form of a [[tornado]], appears and sweeps everyone in its vortex. Elsa stops it, forming a set of ice sculptures. The sisters discover the sculptures are images from their father's past. They encounter the Northuldra and a troop of Arendellian soldiers who are still in conflict with one another. When the Fire spirit appears, Elsa discovers the spirit to be an agitated magical [[Salamanders in folklore|salamander]], and calms it down. Elsa and Anna arrange a truce between the soldiers and the Northuldra after discovering that their mother, Queen Iduna, was a Northuldra who had saved Agnarr, an Arendellian. They later learn the existence of a fifth spirit who will unite people and the magic of nature.\n\nElsa, Anna and Olaf continue to head north, leaving Kristoff and Sven behind. They find their parents' wrecked ship and a map with a route to Ahtohallan, a mythical river told by their mother to contain all explanations of the past. Elsa sends Anna and Olaf away to safety and continues alone. She encounters and tames the [[Neck (water spirit)|N\u00f8kk]], the Water spirit who guards the sea to Ahtohallan. Reaching Ahtohallan, a [[glacier]], Elsa discovers that the voice calling to her was the memory of young Iduna's call; that her powers were given to her by nature because of Iduna's selfless act of saving Agnarr; and that Elsa herself is the fifth spirit.\n\nElsa then learns that the dam was built as a ruse to reduce the Northuldra's resources because of King Runeard's dislike of the tribe's connection with magic and his intention to incorporate the region into his kingdom. She also learns he was the one who initiated the conflict by killing the unarmed leader of the Northuldra. Elsa sends this information to Anna before becoming frozen due to venturing into the most dangerous part of Ahtohallan. This in turn causes Olaf to fade away.\n\nAnna receives Elsa's message and concludes that the dam must be destroyed for peace to be restored. Anna finds and awakens the [[Giant|gigantic Earth spirits]] and lures them towards the dam. The giants hurl boulders aimed at Anna which destroy the dam, sending a flood down the [[fjord]] to the kingdom. Elsa thaws out and returns to Arendelle, diverting the flood and saving the kingdom.\n\nAs the mist disappears, Elsa reunites with Anna and revives Olaf. Kristoff asks Anna to marry him and she accepts. Elsa explains that she and Anna are now the bridge between the magical spirits and the people. Anna becomes the Queen of Arendelle while Elsa becomes the protector of the Enchanted Forest, who regularly visits Arendelle as peace has been restored.\n\nIn a [[post-credit scene]], Olaf visits Elsa's ice palace and recounts the events he experienced to Marshmallow and the Snowgies.{{efn|As depicted in the 2015 short ''[[Frozen Fever]]''.}}\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kristen Bell]] as [[Anna (Frozen)|Anna]], Princess of Arendelle, and Elsa's younger sister<ref name=Frozen2cast />\n** Hadley Gannaway and Livvy Stubenrauch (archived sound) as Young Anna<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n* [[Idina Menzel]] as [[Elsa (Frozen)|Elsa]], Queen of Arendelle and Anna's elder sister who possesses magical ice powers<ref name=\"Frozen2cast\">{{cite news|last1=Sharf|first1=Zack|title='Frozen 2' First Trailer: Elsa and Anna Return in Dazzling New Footage|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/02/frozen-2-first-trailer-elsa-1202043757/|work=[[IndieWire]]|date=February 13, 2019|access-date=February 15, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190216153103/https://www.indiewire.com/2019/02/frozen-2-first-trailer-elsa-1202043757/|archive-date=February 16, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n** Mattea Conforti and [[Eva Bella]] (archived sound) as Young Elsa<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n* [[Josh Gad]] as [[Olaf (Frozen)|Olaf]], a sentient snowman created by Elsa's magic<ref name=Frozen2cast />\n* [[Jonathan Groff]] as [[Kristoff (Frozen)|Kristoff]], an ice harvester and Anna's boyfriend\n** Groff also provides the voices of [[Sven (Frozen)|Sven]] and the reindeer.<ref name=\"PressKit\" />\n* [[Sterling K.

However, a fight occurs, resulting in Runeard's death and enraging the [[Classical element|elemental spirits]] of [[Earth (classical element)|Earth]], [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]], [[Water (classical element)|Water]], and [[Air (classical element)|Air]] of the forest. The spirits disappear and a wall of mist traps everyone in the Enchanted Forest. Young Agnarr barely escapes due to the help of an unknown savior.\n\nThree years after her coronation,{{efn|name=Timeline|As depicted in the 2013 film ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]''.}} Elsa celebrates autumn in the kingdom with Anna, [[Olaf (Frozen)|Olaf]] the snowman, [[Kristoff (Frozen)|Kristoff]] the ice harvester, and Kristoff's reindeer [[Sven (Frozen)|Sven]]. One night, when Elsa hears a mysterious voice [[Kulning|calling out]] to her, she follows it and unintentionally awakens the elemental spirits, which forces everyone in the kingdom to evacuate. Grand Pabbie and the Trolls colony arrive at Arendelle and Pabbie informs that they must set things right by discovering the truth about the kingdom's past.\n\nElsa, Anna, Olaf, Kristoff, and Sven embark to the Enchanted Forest, following the mysterious voice. After the mist parts at Elsa's touch, the Air spirit, in the form of a [[tornado]], appears and sweeps everyone in its vortex. Elsa stops it, forming a set of ice sculptures. The sisters discover the sculptures are images from their father's past. They encounter the Northuldra and a troop of Arendellian soldiers who are still in conflict with one another. When the Fire spirit appears, Elsa discovers the spirit to be an agitated magical [[Salamanders in folklore|salamander]], and calms it down. Elsa and Anna arrange a truce between the soldiers and the Northuldra after discovering that their mother, Queen Iduna, was a Northuldra who had saved Agnarr, an Arendellian. They later learn the existence of a fifth spirit who will unite people and the magic of nature.\n\nElsa, Anna and Olaf continue to head north, leaving Kristoff and Sven behind. They find their parents' wrecked ship and a map with a route to Ahtohallan, a mythical river told by their mother to contain all explanations of the past. Elsa sends Anna and Olaf away to safety and continues alone. She encounters and tames the [[Neck (water spirit)|N\u00f8kk]], the Water spirit who guards the sea to Ahtohallan. Reaching Ahtohallan, a [[glacier]], Elsa discovers that the voice calling to her was the memory of young Iduna's call; that her powers were given to her by nature because of Iduna's selfless act of saving Agnarr; and that Elsa herself is the fifth spirit.\n\nElsa then learns that the dam was built as a ruse to reduce the Northuldra's resources because of King Runeard's dislike of the tribe's connection with magic and his intention to incorporate the region into his kingdom. She also learns he was the one who initiated the conflict by killing the unarmed leader of the Northuldra. Elsa sends this information to Anna before becoming frozen due to venturing into the most dangerous part of Ahtohallan. This in turn causes Olaf to fade away.\n\nAnna receives Elsa's message and concludes that the dam must be destroyed for peace to be restored. Anna finds and awakens the [[Giant|gigantic Earth spirits]] and lures them towards the dam. The giants hurl boulders aimed at Anna which destroy the dam, sending a flood down the [[fjord]] to the kingdom. Elsa thaws out and returns to Arendelle, diverting the flood and saving the kingdom.\n\nAs the mist disappears, Elsa reunites with Anna and revives Olaf. Kristoff asks Anna to marry him and she accepts. Elsa explains that she and Anna are now the bridge between the magical spirits and the people. Anna becomes the Queen of Arendelle while Elsa becomes the protector of the Enchanted Forest, who regularly visits Arendelle as peace has been restored.\n\nIn a [[post-credit scene]], Olaf visits Elsa's ice palace and recounts the events he experienced to Marshmallow and the Snowgies.{{efn|As depicted in the 2015 short ''[[Frozen Fever]]''.}}\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kristen Bell]] as [[Anna (Frozen)|Anna]], Princess of Arendelle, and Elsa's younger sister<ref name=Frozen2cast />\n** Hadley Gannaway and Livvy Stubenrauch (archived sound) as Young Anna<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n* [[Idina Menzel]] as [[Elsa (Frozen)|Elsa]], Queen of Arendelle and Anna's elder sister who possesses magical ice powers<ref name=\"Frozen2cast\">{{cite news|last1=Sharf|first1=Zack|title='Frozen 2' First Trailer: Elsa and Anna Return in Dazzling New Footage|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/02/frozen-2-first-trailer-elsa-1202043757/|work=[[IndieWire]]|date=February 13, 2019|access-date=February 15, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190216153103/https://www.indiewire.com/2019/02/frozen-2-first-trailer-elsa-1202043757/|archive-date=February 16, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n** Mattea Conforti and [[Eva Bella]] (archived sound) as Young Elsa<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n* [[Josh Gad]] as [[Olaf (Frozen)|Olaf]], a sentient snowman created by Elsa's magic<ref name=Frozen2cast />\n* [[Jonathan Groff]] as [[Kristoff (Frozen)|Kristoff]], an ice harvester and Anna's boyfriend\n** Groff also provides the voices of [[Sven (Frozen)|Sven]] and the reindeer.<ref name=\"PressKit\" />\n* [[Sterling K.

The [[Imperial Japanese Army]] continued to occupy Siberia even after other Allied forces withdrew in 1920.\n\n==Background==\n{{Main|Russian Civil War|Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War}}\nFollowing the Russian [[October Revolution]] of 1917, the new [[Bolshevik]] government signed a [[separate peace]] treaty with [[German Empire|Germany]]. The collapse of the [[Eastern Front of World War I]] presented a tremendous problem to the [[Triple Entente|Entente]] powers since it allowed Germany to shift troops and war material to the [[Western Front of World War I]]. As well as this, the 50,000-strong [[Czechoslovak Legion]], fighting on the side of the Allied Powers, was no longer in friendly territory, and was attempting to fight its way out through the east to [[Vladivostok]] along the Bolshevik-held [[Trans-Siberian Railway]].\n\nFaced with these concerns, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and [[French Third Republic|France]] decided to intervene in the Russian Civil War against the Bolsheviks. They had three objectives: \n# to prevent the Allied war material stockpiles in Russia from falling into German or Bolshevik hands\n# to help the Czechoslovak Legion and return it to the fighting\n# to resurrect the Eastern Front by installing a [[White movement|White Russian]]-backed government\n\nThe British and French asked the [[United States]] to furnish troops for both the [[North Russia Campaign]] and the Siberian Campaign. In July 1918, against the advice of the [[United States Department of War]], [[Woodrow Wilson|President Wilson]] agreed to send 5,000 US troops as the American North Russia Expeditionary Force (aka the [[Polar Bear Expedition]]) and 10,000 US troops as the [[American Expeditionary Force Siberia]]. In the same month, the [[Beiyang government]] of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] responded to an appeal by Chinese people in Russia and sent 2,000 troops by August.<ref>{{cite book |publisher=Central European University Press |editor-first=P\u00e1l |editor-last=Ny\u00edri |editor2-first=Joana |editor2-last=Breidenbach |year=2005 |isbn=963-7326-14-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=icZJJN0wYPcC&pg=PA90 |volume= |accessdate=18 March 2012 |first=Joana |last=Breidenbach |location= |title=China Inside Out: Contemporary Chinese Nationalism and Transnationalism |edition=Illustrated |quote= |page=90 }}</ref> The Chinese later [[Occupation of Mongolia|occupied Outer Mongolia]] and [[Tuva]] and sent a battalion to the North Russian Campaign as part of their anti-Bolshevik efforts.\n\n==Participants==\n===British Empire===\nThe [[British Army]] deployed 1,500 troops to Siberia.{{citation needed|date=July 2015|reason=seems less than 2 battalions worth; no support troops?}} These came from the 1/9th ([[Bicycle infantry|Cyclist]]) Battalion, [[Hampshire Regiment]]<ref>{{harvnb|James|1978|p=62}}</ref> (deployed from India) and the 25th Battalion, [[Middlesex Regiment]] (deployed from Iraq).<ref>{{harvnb|James|1978|p=78}}</ref>\n\n====Canada====\n{{Main|Canadian Siberian Expeditionary Force}}\n[[File:Canadian Pte Edwin Stephenson poses with boys in Vladivostok in 1919.jpg|thumb|Canadian soldier poses with boys in [[Vladivostok]].]]\n\nThe Canadian Siberian Expeditionary Force, authorised in August 1918 and commanded by Major General [[James H.

During this time, the Canadians saw little fighting, with fewer than 100 troops proceeding \"up country\" to [[Omsk]], to serve as administrative staff for 1,500 British troops aiding the White Russian government of Admiral [[Alexander Kolchak]]. Most Canadians remained in Vladivostok, undertaking routine drill and policing duties in the volatile port city.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Benjamin |last=Isitt |title=Mutiny from Victoria to Vladivostok, December 1918 |journal=[[Canadian Historical Review]] |volume=87 |issue=2 |year=2006 |pages=223\u2013264 |doi=10.3138/CHR/87.2.223 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.SiberianExpedition.ca Canada's Siberian Expedition website]</ref>\n\n===China===\nAt the request of Chinese merchants, 2,300 Chinese troops were sent to Vladivostok to protect Chinese interests there.

Allied army support was given to Admiral Kolchak's White government at [[Omsk]], while the Japanese continued to support Kolchak's rivals in [[Grigory Mikhaylovich Semyonov|Grigory Semyonov]] and [[Ivan Kalmykov]].<ref name=\"Humphreys p.27\">Humphreys, ''The Way of the Heavenly Sword: The Japanese Army in the 1920s'', page 27</ref> In the summer of 1919, the White regime in Siberia collapsed,<ref name=\"Humphreys p.27\"/> after the capture and execution of [[Aleksandr Kolchak|Admiral Kolchak]] by the Red Army.\n\nIn June 1920, the Americans, British and the remaining allied coalition partners withdrew from [[Vladivostok]]. The evacuation of the Czechoslovak Legion was also carried out in the same year.\nHowever, the Japanese decided to stay, primarily due to fears of the spread of [[communism]] so close to Japan, and the Japanese controlled [[Korea]] and [[Manchuria]]. The Japanese were forced to sign the [[Gongota Agreement of 1920]] in order to evacuate their troops peacefully from Transbaikal. It meant an unavoidable end to [[Grigory Mikhaylovich Semyonov|Grigory Semyonov]]'s regime in October 1920.\n\nThe Japanese army provided military support to the Japanese-backed [[Provisional Priamur Government]] based in Vladivostok against the [[Moscow]]-backed [[Far Eastern Republic]]. The continued Japanese presence concerned the United States, which suspected that Japan had territorial designs on Siberia and the Russian Far East. Subjected to intense diplomatic pressure by the United States and the United Kingdom, and facing increasing domestic opposition due to the economic and human cost, the administration of Prime Minister [[Kato Tomosaburo]] withdrew the Japanese forces in October 1922.\n\n===Legacy===\n====Effects on Japanese politics====\nJapan's motives in the Siberian intervention were complex and poorly articulated. Overtly, Japan (as with the United States and the other international coalition forces) was in Siberia to safeguard stockpiled military supplies and to \"rescue\" the [[Czechoslovak Legions|Czechoslovak Legion]]. However, the Japanese government's intense hostility to communism, a determination to recoup historical losses to Russia, and the perceived opportunity to settle the \"northern problem\" in Japan's security by either creating a buffer state,<ref name=\"Humphreys, p.25\"/> or through outright territorial acquisition, were also factors. However, patronage of various White Movement leaders left Japan in a poor diplomatic position vis-\u00e0-vis the government of the [[Soviet Union]], after the Red Army eventually emerged victorious from the Russian Civil War. The intervention tore Japan's wartime unity to shreds, leading to the army and government being involved in bitter controversy, as well as renewed factional strife in the army itself.<ref name=\"Humphreys, p.25\"/>\n\nJapanese casualties from the Siberian Expedition included some 5,000 dead from combat or illness, and the expenses incurred were in excess of 900 million yen.\n\n==See also==\n* [[North Russia intervention]]\n* [[Southern Russia intervention]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* Wright, Damien. \"Churchill's Secret War with Lenin: British and Commonwealth Military Intervention in the Russian Civil War, 1918-20\", Solihull, UK, 2017\n* {{cite book |last=Graves |first=William S. |date=1931 |title=America's Siberian Adventure 1918-1920 |url=http://www.e-reading.co.uk/book.php?book=133957 |location=New York |publisher=Peter Smith |isbn= |accessdate= }}\n* {{cite thesis |last= Beattie|first= Steuart|date= 1957|title= Canadian Intervention in Russia, 1918-1919|type= MA|publisher= [[McGill University]]|url= http://digitool.library.mcgill.ca/webclient/StreamGate?folder_id=0&dvs=1512127244520~302|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal |last1= Smith|first1= Gaddis|date= 1959|title= Canada and the Siberian Intervention, 1918\u20131919|jstor= 1905120|journal= [[The American Historical Review]]|volume= 64|issue= 4|pages= 866\u2013877|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book | last = Humphreys | first = Leonard A. | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 1996 | chapter = | title = The Way of the Heavenly Sword: The Japanese Army in the 1920s | publisher = Stanford University Press | location = | isbn = 0-8047-2375-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vlA3wijPak4C }}\n* {{cite book\n  | ref = harv\n  | last = James | first = Brigadier E.A.\n  | year = 1978\n  | title = British Regiments 1914\u201318\n  | publisher = Samson Books Limited\n  | location = London\n  | isbn = 0-906304-03-2\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=2ky-BAAAQBAJ\n}}\n* {{cite book | last = Kinvig | first = Clifford | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2006 | chapter = | title = Churchill's Crusade: The British Invasion of Russia, 1918\u20131920 | publisher = Continuum International Publishing Group | location = | isbn = 1-85285-477-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uKGspZ8XmNYC }}\n* {{cite book |last=White |first=John Albert |title=The Siberian Intervention |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |year=1950 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CHAjAQAAIAAJ }}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.siberianexpedition.ca Canada's Siberian Expedition] website, by Benjamin Isitt\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070625054247/http://nortvoods.net/rrs/siberia/jonessibdiary-2.htm WWI Siberian Diary, by W.C.

The [[Imperial Japanese Army]] continued to occupy Siberia even after other Allied forces withdrew in 1920.\n\n==Background==\n{{Main|Russian Civil War|Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War}}\nFollowing the Russian [[October Revolution]] of 1917, the new [[Bolshevik]] government signed a [[separate peace]] treaty with [[German Empire|Germany]]. The collapse of the [[Eastern Front of World War I]] presented a tremendous problem to the [[Triple Entente|Entente]] powers since it allowed Germany to shift troops and war material to the [[Western Front of World War I]]. As well as this, the 50,000-strong [[Czechoslovak Legion]], fighting on the side of the Allied Powers, was no longer in friendly territory, and was attempting to fight its way out through the east to [[Vladivostok]] along the Bolshevik-held [[Trans-Siberian Railway]].\n\nFaced with these concerns, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and [[French Third Republic|France]] decided to intervene in the Russian Civil War against the Bolsheviks. They had three objectives: \n# to prevent the Allied war material stockpiles in Russia from falling into German or Bolshevik hands\n# to help the Czechoslovak Legion and return it to the fighting\n# to resurrect the Eastern Front by installing a [[White movement|White Russian]]-backed government\n\nThe British and French asked the [[United States]] to furnish troops for both the [[North Russia Campaign]] and the Siberian Campaign. In July 1918, against the advice of the [[United States Department of War]], [[Woodrow Wilson|President Wilson]] agreed to send 5,000 US troops as the American North Russia Expeditionary Force (aka the [[Polar Bear Expedition]]) and 10,000 US troops as the [[American Expeditionary Force Siberia]]. In the same month, the [[Beiyang government]] of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] responded to an appeal by Chinese people in Russia and sent 2,000 troops by August.<ref>{{cite book |publisher=Central European University Press |editor-first=P\u00e1l |editor-last=Ny\u00edri |editor2-first=Joana |editor2-last=Breidenbach |year=2005 |isbn=963-7326-14-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=icZJJN0wYPcC&pg=PA90 |volume= |accessdate=18 March 2012 |first=Joana |last=Breidenbach |location= |title=China Inside Out: Contemporary Chinese Nationalism and Transnationalism |edition=Illustrated |quote= |page=90 }}</ref> The Chinese later [[Occupation of Mongolia|occupied Outer Mongolia]] and [[Tuva]] and sent a battalion to the North Russian Campaign as part of their anti-Bolshevik efforts.\n\n==Participants==\n===British Empire===\nThe [[British Army]] deployed 1,500 troops to Siberia.{{citation needed|date=July 2015|reason=seems less than 2 battalions worth; no support troops?}} These came from the 1/9th ([[Bicycle infantry|Cyclist]]) Battalion, [[Hampshire Regiment]]<ref>{{harvnb|James|1978|p=62}}</ref> (deployed from India) and the 25th Battalion, [[Middlesex Regiment]] (deployed from Iraq).<ref>{{harvnb|James|1978|p=78}}</ref>\n\n====Canada====\n{{Main|Canadian Siberian Expeditionary Force}}\n[[File:Canadian Pte Edwin Stephenson poses with boys in Vladivostok in 1919.jpg|thumb|Canadian soldier poses with boys in [[Vladivostok]].]]\n\nThe Canadian Siberian Expeditionary Force, commanded by Major General [[James H.

The deployment of a large force for a rescue expedition made the Allies wary of Japanese intentions.<ref name=Humphreys,p.26/> On September 5, the Japanese linked up with the vanguard of the Czechoslovak Legion.<ref name=Humphreys,p.26/> A few days later the British, Italian and French contingents joined the Czechs and Slovaks in an effort to re-establish the east Front beyond the Urals; as a result the European allies trekked westwards.<ref name=Humphreys,p.26/> The Japanese, with their own objectives in mind, refused to proceed west of Lake Baikal<ref name=Humphreys,p.26/> and stayed behind. The Americans, suspicious of Japanese intentions, also stayed behind to keep an eye on the Japanese.<ref name=Humphreys,p.26/> By November, the Japanese occupied all ports and major towns in the Russian [[Primorsky Krai|Maritime Provinces]] and in [[Siberia]] east of the city of [[Chita, Zabaykalsky Krai|Chita]].<ref name=Humphreys,p.26/>\n\nIn the summer of 1918 onwards, the Japanese army lent its support to White Russian elements;<ref name=Humphreys,p.26/> the [[5th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|5th infantry division]] and the Japanese-backed Special Manchurian Detachment of Grigory Semyonov took control over [[Transbaikalia]] and founded a short-lived [[White movement in Transbaikal|White Transbaikalia]] government.\n\nThe various Allied forces did not function well together, because of the underlying chaos and suspicion.{{sfn|Smith|1959|p=872}} In a letter to Canadian [[Minister of Militia and Defence]] [[Sydney Chilton Mewburn|Sydney Mewburn]], [[James H. Elmsley]], commander of the British and Canadian forces, gave a description of the situation:\n\n{{quote|\nThe general situation here is an extraordinary one{{em dash}}at first glance one assumes that everyone distrusts everyone else{{em dash}}the Japs being distrusted ''more'' than anyone else. Americans and Japs don't hit it off. The French keep a very close eye on the British, and the Russians as a whole appear to be indifferent of their country's needs, so long as they can keep their women, have their vodka, and play cards all night until daylight. The Czechs appear to be the only honest and conscientious party among the Allies.{{sfn|Beattie|1957|p=119}}\n}}\n\nIn one incident an American unit, [[27th Infantry Regiment (United States)|27th Infantry Regiment (Wolfhounds)]] was part of the [[Evgenevka incident]], a face-off between the Wolfhounds and the [[Japanese intervention in Siberia|Japanese Military]].\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Allied withdrawal (1919\u20131920)===\nWith the end of the war in Europe, the Allied Powers decided to support the anti-Bolshevik White forces and effectively intervene in the Russian Civil War. Allied army support was given to Admiral Kolchak's White government at [[Omsk]], while the Japanese continued to support Kolchak's rivals in [[Grigory Mikhaylovich Semyonov|Grigory Semyonov]] and [[Ivan Kalmykov]].<ref name=\"Humphreys p.27\">Humphreys, ''The Way of the Heavenly Sword: The Japanese Army in the 1920s'', page 27</ref> In the summer of 1919, the White regime in Siberia collapsed,<ref name=\"Humphreys p.27\"/> after the capture and execution of [[Aleksandr Kolchak|Admiral Kolchak]] by the Red Army.\n\nIn June 1920, the Americans, British and the remaining allied coalition partners withdrew from [[Vladivostok]]. The evacuation of the Czechoslovak Legion was also carried out in the same year.\nHowever, the Japanese decided to stay, primarily due to fears of the spread of [[communism]] so close to Japan, and the Japanese controlled [[Korea]] and [[Manchuria]]. The Japanese were forced to sign the [[Gongota Agreement of 1920]] in order to evacuate their troops peacefully from Transbaikal. It meant an unavoidable end to [[Grigory Mikhaylovich Semyonov|Grigory Semyonov]]'s regime in October 1920.\n\nThe Japanese army provided military support to the Japanese-backed [[Provisional Priamur Government]] based in Vladivostok against the [[Moscow]]-backed [[Far Eastern Republic]]. The continued Japanese presence concerned the United States, which suspected that Japan had territorial designs on Siberia and the Russian Far East. Subjected to intense diplomatic pressure by the United States and the United Kingdom, and facing increasing domestic opposition due to the economic and human cost, the administration of Prime Minister [[Kato Tomosaburo]] withdrew the Japanese forces in October 1922.\n\n===Legacy===\n====Effects on Japanese politics====\nJapan's motives in the Siberian intervention were complex and poorly articulated. Overtly, Japan (as with the United States and the other international coalition forces) was in Siberia to safeguard stockpiled military supplies and to \"rescue\" the [[Czechoslovak Legions|Czechoslovak Legion]]. However, the Japanese government's intense hostility to communism, a determination to recoup historical losses to Russia, and the perceived opportunity to settle the \"northern problem\" in Japan's security by either creating a buffer state,<ref name=\"Humphreys, p.25\"/> or through outright territorial acquisition, were also factors. However, patronage of various White Movement leaders left Japan in a poor diplomatic position vis-\u00e0-vis the government of the [[Soviet Union]], after the Red Army eventually emerged victorious from the Russian Civil War. The intervention tore Japan's wartime unity to shreds, leading to the army and government being involved in bitter controversy, as well as renewed factional strife in the army itself.<ref name=\"Humphreys, p.25\"/>\n\nJapanese casualties from the Siberian Expedition included some 5,000 dead from combat or illness, and the expenses incurred were in excess of 900 million yen.\n\n==See also==\n* [[North Russia intervention]]\n* [[Southern Russia intervention]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* Wright, Damien. \"Churchill's Secret War with Lenin: British and Commonwealth Military Intervention in the Russian Civil War, 1918-20\", Solihull, UK, 2017\n* {{cite book |last=Graves |first=William S. |date=1931 |title=America's Siberian Adventure 1918-1920 |url=http://www.e-reading.co.uk/book.php?book=133957 |location=New York |publisher=Peter Smith |isbn= |accessdate= }}\n* {{cite thesis |last= Beattie|first= Steuart|date= 1957|title= Canadian Intervention in Russia, 1918-1919|type= MA|publisher= [[McGill University]]|url= http://digitool.library.mcgill.ca/webclient/StreamGate?folder_id=0&dvs=1512127244520~302|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal |last1= Smith|first1= Gaddis|date= 1959|title= Canada and the Siberian Intervention, 1918\u20131919|jstor= 1905120|journal= [[The American Historical Review]]|volume= 64|issue= 4|pages= 866\u2013877|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book | last = Humphreys | first = Leonard A. | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 1996 | chapter = | title = The Way of the Heavenly Sword: The Japanese Army in the 1920s | publisher = Stanford University Press | location = | isbn = 0-8047-2375-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vlA3wijPak4C }}\n* {{cite book\n  | ref = harv\n  | last = James | first = Brigadier E.A.\n  | year = 1978\n  | title = British Regiments 1914\u201318\n  | publisher = Samson Books Limited\n  | location = London\n  | isbn = 0-906304-03-2\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=2ky-BAAAQBAJ\n}}\n* {{cite book | last = Kinvig | first = Clifford | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2006 | chapter = | title = Churchill's Crusade: The British Invasion of Russia, 1918\u20131920 | publisher = Continuum International Publishing Group | location = | isbn = 1-85285-477-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uKGspZ8XmNYC }}\n* {{cite book |last=White |first=John Albert |title=The Siberian Intervention |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |year=1950 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CHAjAQAAIAAJ }}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.siberianexpedition.ca Canada's Siberian Expedition] website, by Benjamin Isitt\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070625054247/http://nortvoods.net/rrs/siberia/jonessibdiary-2.htm WWI Siberian Diary, by W.C.

{"title_page": "Postal savings system", "text_new": "{{Banking |banks}}\n{{cleanup rewrite|date=March 2017}}\n{{refimprove|date=March 2017}}\n\n'''Postal savings systems''' provide depositors who [[unbanked|do not have access to banks]] a safe and convenient method to save money. Many nations have operated banking systems involving [[post office]]s to promote saving money among the poor.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Inside a Post Office Savings Bank deposit book.jpg|thumb|200px|right|alt=A page with a pre-printed table. It has handwritten entries showing amounts of deposits and withdrawals, and the balance. Each entry has a post office date stamp.|This 1869 [[Passbook|deposit book]] would be carried by the customer, and is a typical record of a British Post Office Savings Bank savings account.]]\n\nIn 1861, [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] became the first nation to offer such an arrangement. It was supported by [[Sir Rowland Hill]], who successfully advocated the [[penny post]], and [[William Ewart Gladstone]], then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], who saw it as a cheap way to finance the public debt.  At the time, banks were mainly in the cities and largely catered to wealthy customers.  Rural citizens and the poor had no choice but to keep their funds at home or on their persons.\n\nThe original Post Office Savings Bank was limited to deposits of \u00a330 per year with a maximum balance of \u00a3150.  Interest was paid at the rate of 2.5 percent per annum on whole pounds in the account.  Later, the limits were raised to a maximum of \u00a3500 per year in deposits with no limit on the total amount.  Within five years of the system's establishment, there were over 600,000 accounts and \u00a38.2 million on deposit.  By 1927, there were twelve million accounts&mdash;one in four Britons&mdash;with \u00a3283 million (\u00a3{{inflation|UK|283|1927|r=0|fmt=c}} million today) on deposit.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001127214 |title=Notes on the postal savings-bank systems of the leading countries |last=United States |first=National Monetary Commission |publisher=Govt. print. off |location=Washington |publication-date=1910 |pages=7\u20138}}</ref>\n\nThe British system first offered only [[savings account]]s. In 1880, it also became a retail outlet for [[government bond]]s, and in 1916 introduced [[War bond|war savings certificates]], which were renamed National Savings Certificates in 1920.<ref name=\"archive\">{{Cite web|url=http://postalheritage.org.uk/collections/archive/businesshistory/savingsbank|title=Business history records: Post Office Savings Bank|publisher=British Postal Museum & Archive}}</ref>\nIn 1956, it launched a lottery bond, the [[Premium Bond]], which became its most popular savings certificate.<ref name=\"archive\" />  \nPost Office Savings Bank became National Savings Bank in 1969, later renamed [[National Savings and Investments]] (NS&I), an agency of HM Treasury. While continuing to offer National Savings services, the (then) [[General Post Office]], created the [[National Giro]] in 1968 (privatized as Girobank and acquired by [[Alliance & Leicester]] in 1989).\n\nMany other countries adopted such systems soon afterwards.

It was supported by [[Sir Rowland Hill]], who successfully advocated the [[penny post]], and [[William Ewart Gladstone]], then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], who saw it as a cheap way to finance the public debt.  At the time, banks were mainly in the cities and largely catered to wealthy customers.  Rural citizens and the poor had no choice but to keep their funds at home or on their persons.\n\nThe original Post Office Savings Bank was limited to deposits of \u00a330 per year with a maximum balance of \u00a3150.  Interest was paid at the rate of 2.5 percent per annum on whole pounds in the account.  Later, the limits were raised to a maximum of \u00a3500 per year in deposits with no limit on the total amount.  Within five years of the system's establishment, there were over 600,000 accounts and \u00a38.2 million on deposit.

I guess maybe some of it I felt I had to do in spite of them, too.\"<ref name=\"achieve\"/>\n\n==Career==\n===Education and early films (1969\u201379)===\nZemeckis first attended [[Northern Illinois University]] in DeKalb, Illinois, and gained early experience in film as a film cutter for NBC News in Chicago during a summer break.<ref>[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-04-19/news/9804190301_1_economic-club-cultural-center-fry Chicago Tribune (19 April 1998)]</ref> He also edited commercials in his home state.<ref>[http://expdvl.com/internet/FAMOUS/WWWINE~1.NET/~WODIGE/SSFS/ZEMECKIS/BIOTEX~1.HTM Biotex]</ref> Zemeckis applied to transfer from NIU to the [[University of Southern California]]'s [[USC School of Cinematic Arts|School of Cinematic Arts]] in Los Angeles, California and went into the Film School on the strength of an essay and a music video based on a [[The Beatles|Beatles]] song. Not having heard from the university itself, Zemeckis called and was told he had been rejected because of his average grades. He gave an \"impassioned plea\" to the official on the other line, promising to go to summer school and improve his studies, and eventually convinced the school to accept him. Arriving at USC that fall, Zemeckis encountered a program that was, in his words, made up of \"a bunch of hippies [and] considered an embarrassment by the university.\" The classes were difficult, with professors constantly stressing how hard the movie business was. Zemeckis remembered not being much fazed by this, citing the \"healthy cynicism\" that had been bred into him from his Chicago upbringing.<ref name=\"achieve\"/>\n\nAt USC Zemeckis met a fellow student, writer [[Bob Gale]]. Gale later recalled, \"The graduate students at USC had this veneer of intellectualism...So Bob and I gravitated toward one another because we wanted to make Hollywood movies. We weren't interested in the [[French New Wave]]. We were interested in [[Clint Eastwood]] and [[James Bond]] and [[Walt Disney]], because that's how we grew up.\"<ref name=\"block\">Shone, Tom.

Spielberg said, \"He barged right past my secretary and sat me down and showed me this student film...and I thought it was spectacular, with police cars and a riot, all dubbed to [[Elmer Bernstein]]'s score for ''[[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]''.\"<ref name=\"block\"/> Spielberg became Zemeckis's mentor and executive produced his first two films, both of which Gale and Zemeckis co-wrote.\n\n''[[I Wanna Hold Your Hand (film)|I Wanna Hold Your Hand]]'' (1978), starring [[Nancy Allen (actress)|Nancy Allen]], and  ''[[Used Cars]]'' (1980), starring [[Kurt Russell]], were well-received critically but were commercial failures. ''I Wanna Hold Your Hand'' was the first of several Zemeckis films to incorporate historical figures and celebrities into his movies. In the film, he used archival footage and doubles to simulate the presence of The Beatles. After the failure of his first two films, and the Spielberg-directed bomb ''[[1941 (film)|1941]]'' in 1979 (for which Zemeckis and Gale had written the screenplay), the pair gained a reputation for writing \"scripts that everyone thought were great [but] somehow didn't translate into movies people wanted to see.\"<ref name=\"block\"/>\n\n===Breakthrough and ''Forrest Gump''  (1980\u201397)===\nAs a result of his reputation within the industry, Zemeckis had trouble finding work in the early 1980s, though he and Gale kept busy. They wrote scripts for other directors, including ''Car Pool'' for [[Brian De Palma]] and ''Growing Up'' for Spielberg; neither ended up getting made. Another Zemeckis-Gale project, [[Back to the Future|about a teenager who accidentally travels back in time to the 1950s]], was turned down by every major studio.<ref name=\"horo\">Horowitz, Mark. \"Back with a Future\", [[American Film (magazine)|''American Film'']], July/August 1988. pp. 32\u201335.</ref> The director was jobless until [[Michael Douglas]] hired him in 1984 to direct ''[[Romancing the Stone]]''. A romantic adventure starring Douglas and [[Kathleen Turner]], ''Romancing'' was expected to flop (to the point that, after viewing a rough cut of the film, the producers of the then-in-the-works ''[[Cocoon (film)|Cocoon]]'' fired Zemeckis as director),<ref name=\"horo\"/> but the film became a sleeper hit. While working on ''Romancing the Stone'', Zemeckis met composer [[Alan Silvestri]], who has scored all his subsequent pictures.\n\n[[File:Zemeckis1997(cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Overseeing the filming of ''Contact'' (1997)]]\nAfter ''Romancing'', the director had the clout to direct his time-traveling screenplay, which was titled ''[[Back to the Future]]''. Starring [[Michael J. Fox]], [[Lea Thompson]], [[Crispin Glover]], and [[Christopher Lloyd]], the 1985 film was wildly successful upon its release, and was followed by two sequels, released as ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'' in 1989 and ''[[Back to the Future Part III]]'' in 1990. Before the ''Back to the Future'' sequels were released, Zemeckis collaborated with Disney and directed another film, the madcap 1940s-set mystery ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', which painstakingly combined [[traditional animation]] and live-action; its $70 million budget made it one of the most expensive films made up to that point. The film was both a financial and critical success and won three [[Academy Award]]s. In 1990, Zemeckis commented, when asked if he would want to make non-comedies, \"I would like to be able to do everything. Just now, though, I'm too restless to do anything that's not really zany.\"<ref name=\"horo\"/>\n\nIn 1992, Zemeckis directed the black comedy ''[[Death Becomes Her]]'', starring [[Meryl Streep]], [[Goldie Hawn]] and [[Bruce Willis]]. Although his next film would have some comedic elements, it was Zemeckis's first with dramatic elements, and was also his biggest commercial success to date, ''[[Forrest Gump]]''. Starring [[Tom Hanks]] in the title role, ''Forrest Gump'' tells the story of a man with a low [[I.Q.]], who unwittingly participates in some of the major events of the twentieth century, falls in love, and interacts with several major historical figures in the process. The film grossed $677 million worldwide and became the top-grossing US film of 1994; it won six Academy Awards, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (for Hanks) and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] (for Zemeckis). In 1997, Zemeckis directed ''[[Contact (1997 American film)|Contact]]'', a long-gestating project based on [[Carl Sagan]]'s 1985 [[Contact (novel)|novel of the same name]]. The film centers on Eleanor Arroway, a scientist played by [[Jodie Foster]], who believes she has made contact with extraterrestrial beings.\n\n===Later work, 1999\u2013present===\nIn 1999, Zemeckis donated $5 million towards the Robert Zemeckis Center for Digital Arts at USC, a {{convert|35000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} center. When the Center opened in March 2001, Zemeckis spoke in a panel about the future of film, alongside friends Steven Spielberg and [[George Lucas]]. Of those (including Spielberg) who clung to celluloid and disparaged the idea of shooting digitally, Zemeckis said, \"These guys are the same ones who have been saying that [[LP album|LPs]] sound better than CDs. You can argue that until you're blue in the face, but I don't know anyone who's still buying vinyl. The film, as we have traditionally thought of it, is going to be different. But the continuum is man's desire to tell stories around the campfire. The only thing that keeps changing is the campfire.\"<ref>Hayes, Dade, and Dana Harris. \"Helmers mull digital around state-of-art campfire,\" ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', 5 March 2001 (accessed 27 August 2014).</ref> The Robert Zemeckis Center currently hosts many film school classes, much of the [[USC Interactive Media Division|Interactive Media Division]], and [[Trojan Vision]], USC's student television station, which has been voted the number one college television station in the country.\n\nIn 1996, Zemeckis had begun developing a project titled ''The Castaway'' with [[Tom Hanks]] and writer [[William Broyles, Jr.]]. The story, which was inspired by [[Robinson Crusoe]], is about a man who becomes stranded on a desert island and undergoes a profound physical and spiritual change.<ref name=\"lies\">[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,277168,00.html Fall Movie Preview: December], [[Entertainment Weekly]], 18 August 2000 (accessed 11 September 2007).</ref> While working on ''The Castaway'', Zemeckis also became attached to a [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcockian]] thriller titled ''[[What Lies Beneath]]'', the story of a married couple experiencing an extreme case of [[empty nest syndrome]] that was based on an idea by Steven Spielberg.<ref name=\"pair\">Petrikin, Chris.

''The Polar Express'' utilized the [[computer animation]] technique known as [[performance capture]], whereby the movements of the actors are captured digitally and used as the basis for the animated characters.

I mean, there was no music, there were no books, there was no theater... The only thing I had that was inspirational, was television\u2014and it actually was.\"<ref name=\"achieve\"/>\n\nAs a child, he loved television and was fascinated by his parents' [[8 mm film]] home movie camera. Starting off by filming family events like birthdays and holidays, he gradually began producing narrative films with his friends that incorporated [[stop-motion]] work and other special effects. Along with enjoying movies, Zemeckis remained an avid TV watcher. \"You hear so much about the problems with television,\" he said, \"but I think that it saved my life.\" Television gave Zemeckis his first glimpse of a world outside of his blue-collar upbringing;<ref name=\"achieve\"/> specifically, he learned of the existence of [[film school]]s on an episode of ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''. After seeing ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'' with his father and being heavily influenced by it,<ref name= \"castaway\"/> Zemeckis decided that he wanted to go to film school. His parents disapproved of the idea, Zemeckis later said, \"But only in the sense that they were concerned... for my family and my friends and the world that I grew up in, this was the kind of dream that really was impossible. My parents would sit there and say, 'Don't you see where you come from? You can't be a movie director.' I guess maybe some of it I felt I had to do in spite of them, too.\"<ref name=\"achieve\"/>\n\n==Career==\n===Education and early films (1969\u201379)===\nZemeckis first attended [[Northern Illinois University]] in DeKalb, Illinois, and gained early experience in film as a film cutter for NBC News in Chicago during a summer break.<ref>[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-04-19/news/9804190301_1_economic-club-cultural-center-fry Chicago Tribune (19 April 1998)]</ref> He also edited commercials in his home state.<ref>[http://expdvl.com/internet/FAMOUS/WWWINE~1.NET/~WODIGE/SSFS/ZEMECKIS/BIOTEX~1.HTM Biotex]</ref> Zemeckis applied to transfer from NIU to the [[University of Southern California]]'s [[USC School of Cinematic Arts|School of Cinematic Arts]] in Los Angeles, California and went into the Film School on the strength of an essay and a music video based on a [[The Beatles|Beatles]] song. Not having heard from the university itself, Zemeckis called and was told he had been rejected because of his average grades. He gave an \"impassioned plea\" to the official on the other line, promising to go to summer school and improve his studies, and eventually convinced the school to accept him. Arriving at USC that fall, Zemeckis encountered a program that was, in his words, made up of \"a bunch of hippies [and] considered an embarrassment by the university.\" The classes were difficult, with professors constantly stressing how hard the movie business was. Zemeckis remembered not being much fazed by this, citing the \"healthy cynicism\" that had been bred into him from his Chicago upbringing.<ref name=\"achieve\"/>\n\nAt USC Zemeckis met a fellow student, writer [[Bob Gale]]. Gale later recalled, \"The graduate students at USC had this veneer of intellectualism...So Bob and I gravitated toward one another because we wanted to make Hollywood movies. We weren't interested in the [[French New Wave]]. We were interested in [[Clint Eastwood]] and [[James Bond]] and [[Walt Disney]], because that's how we grew up.\"<ref name=\"block\">Shone, Tom.

Spielberg said, \"He barged right past my secretary and sat me down and showed me this student film...and I thought it was spectacular, with police cars and a riot, all dubbed to [[Elmer Bernstein]]'s score for ''[[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]''.\"<ref name=\"block\"/> Spielberg became Zemeckis's mentor and executive produced his first two films, both of which Gale and Zemeckis co-wrote.\n\n''[[I Wanna Hold Your Hand (film)|I Wanna Hold Your Hand]]'' (1978), starring [[Nancy Allen (actress)|Nancy Allen]], and  ''[[Used Cars]]'' (1980), starring [[Kurt Russell]], were well-received critically but were commercial failures. ''I Wanna Hold Your Hand'' was the first of several Zemeckis films to incorporate historical figures and celebrities into his movies. In the film, he used archival footage and doubles to simulate the presence of The Beatles. After the failure of his first two films, and the Spielberg-directed bomb ''[[1941 (film)|1941]]'' in 1979 (for which Zemeckis and Gale had written the screenplay), the pair gained a reputation for writing \"scripts that everyone thought were great [but] somehow didn't translate into movies people wanted to see.\"<ref name=\"block\"/>\n\n===Breakthrough and ''Forrest Gump''  (1980\u201397)===\nAs a result of his reputation within the industry, Zemeckis had trouble finding work in the early 1980s, though he and Gale kept busy. They wrote scripts for other directors, including ''Car Pool'' for [[Brian De Palma]] and ''Growing Up'' for Spielberg; neither ended up getting made. Another Zemeckis-Gale project, [[Back to the Future|about a teenager who accidentally travels back in time to the 1950s]], was turned down by every major studio.<ref name=\"horo\">Horowitz, Mark. \"Back with a Future\", [[American Film (magazine)|''American Film'']], July/August 1988. pp. 32\u201335.</ref> The director was jobless until [[Michael Douglas]] hired him in 1984 to direct ''[[Romancing the Stone]]''. A romantic adventure starring Douglas and [[Kathleen Turner]], ''Romancing'' was expected to flop (to the point that, after viewing a rough cut of the film, the producers of the then-in-the-works ''[[Cocoon (film)|Cocoon]]'' fired Zemeckis as director),<ref name=\"horo\"/> but the film became a sleeper hit. While working on ''Romancing the Stone'', Zemeckis met composer [[Alan Silvestri]], who has scored all his subsequent pictures.\n\n[[File:Zemeckis1997(cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Overseeing the filming of ''Contact'' (1997)]]\nAfter ''Romancing'', the director had the clout to direct his time-traveling screenplay, which was titled ''[[Back to the Future]]''. Starring [[Michael J. Fox]], [[Lea Thompson]], [[Crispin Glover]], and [[Christopher Lloyd]], the 1985 film was wildly successful upon its release, and was followed by two sequels, released as ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'' in 1989 and ''[[Back to the Future Part III]]'' in 1990. Before the ''Back to the Future'' sequels were released, Zemeckis collaborated with Disney and directed another film, the madcap 1940s-set mystery ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', which painstakingly combined [[traditional animation]] and live-action; its $70 million budget made it one of the most expensive films made up to that point. The film was both a financial and critical success and won three [[Academy Award]]s. In 1990, Zemeckis commented, when asked if he would want to make non-comedies, \"I would like to be able to do everything. Just now, though, I'm too restless to do anything that's not really zany.\"<ref name=\"horo\"/>\n\nIn 1992, Zemeckis directed the black comedy ''[[Death Becomes Her]]'', starring [[Meryl Streep]], [[Goldie Hawn]] and [[Bruce Willis]]. Although his next film would have some comedic elements, it was Zemeckis's first with dramatic elements, and was also his biggest commercial success to date, ''[[Forrest Gump]]''. Starring [[Tom Hanks]] in the title role, ''Forrest Gump'' tells the story of a man with a low [[I.Q.]], who unwittingly participates in some of the major events of the twentieth century, falls in love, and interacts with several major historical figures in the process. The film grossed $677 million worldwide and became the top-grossing US film of 1994; it won six Academy Awards, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (for Hanks) and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] (for Zemeckis). In 1997, Zemeckis directed ''[[Contact (1997 American film)|Contact]]'', a long-gestating project based on [[Carl Sagan]]'s 1985 [[Contact (novel)|novel of the same name]]. The film centers on Eleanor Arroway, a scientist played by [[Jodie Foster]], who believes she has made contact with extraterrestrial beings.\n\n===Later work, 1999\u2013present===\nIn 1999, Zemeckis donated $5 million towards the Robert Zemeckis Center for Digital Arts at USC, a {{convert|35000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} center. When the Center opened in March 2001, Zemeckis spoke in a panel about the future of film, alongside friends Steven Spielberg and [[George Lucas]]. Of those (including Spielberg) who clung to celluloid and disparaged the idea of shooting digitally, Zemeckis said, \"These guys are the same ones who have been saying that [[LP album|LPs]] sound better than CDs. You can argue that until you're blue in the face, but I don't know anyone who's still buying vinyl. The film, as we have traditionally thought of it, is going to be different. But the continuum is man's desire to tell stories around the campfire. The only thing that keeps changing is the campfire.\"<ref>Hayes, Dade, and Dana Harris. \"Helmers mull digital around state-of-art campfire,\" ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', 5 March 2001 (accessed 27 August 2014).</ref> The Robert Zemeckis Center currently hosts many film school classes, much of the [[USC Interactive Media Division|Interactive Media Division]], and [[Trojan Vision]], USC's student television station, which has been voted the number one college television station in the country.\n\nIn 1996, Zemeckis had begun developing a project titled ''The Castaway'' with [[Tom Hanks]] and writer [[William Broyles, Jr.]].

''The Polar Express'' utilized the [[computer animation]] technique known as [[performance capture]], whereby the movements of the actors are captured digitally and used as the basis for the animated characters.

All these areas show signs of being used for Maori crops of kumara and bracken fern. These same areas had extensive hangi (earth oven) sites.<ref>History of Howick and Pakuranga. p43 Map. A. LaRoche. 1991</ref>\n\nThe Auckland area came under regular attack by [[Taua]] or war parties from the [[Ng\u0101puhi]] [[iwi]] in [[Northland Region|Northland]]. In 1821 a large musket armed Ngapuhi war party devastated the eastern area of Auckland attacking Mokoia Pa at Panmure.<ref>The History of Howick and Pakuranga. p164-166</ref> By the 1830s many of the local Maori had been killed or enslaved by their deadly enemies to the north. In 1926 Geoff Fairfield, the great grandson of Alfred Buckland and a keen historian, drew a detailed scaled map of the Pa. The main [[isthmus]] of Auckland was also depopulated by Maori migrating south to avoid the regular carnage. The [[Tamaki River]], to the west of Bucklands Beach, became a main highway for attacking Taua or those seeking revenge (utu) from previous attacks.\n\nIn 1835 minor conflict had occurred in the area and threatened to erupt into full-scale war. [[William Thomas Fairburn]], the CMS missionary, attempted to solve the issues for nearly a year. With the agreement of local Maori at a meeting at Puneke on the Tamaki River on 22 January 1836, he purchased the entire Bucklands Beach, [[Howick, New Zealand|Howick]] and [[Pakuranga]] area of {{convert|40000|acre|km2}}. The price paid to 3 local chiefs was 10 blankets, 24 axes, 26 hoes, 14 spades, $80, {{convert|1900|lb|abbr=on}} of tobacco, 24 cobs and 12 plane irons. The value of the goods was about 907 pounds and 17 shillings and 6 pence. The 3 hapu who sold the land were Ngatitawaki, Urikaraka and Matekiwaho. The principal chiefs who signed the sale were Herua, Te Waru, Hauauru and Te Tara. The Treaty of Waitangi was signed at Karaka Bay on the Tamaki River opposite Big Bucklands Beach in 1840 by Capt Hobson and Ngati Paoa.\nAfter the treaty signing the Fairburn purchase was examined by the government, who determined that Fairburn could keep 1/7 of the land, with the rest being claimed by the government, who later sold it on in smaller blocks.\n\n===Europeans===\n\nThe first European to farm this area was Fairburn, New Zealand's first architect. He sold {{convert|350|acre|km2}} to William Mason in 1851 for 500 pounds, but the deed for the land was not processed until 6 September 1852. The land included most of the peninsula apart from what is now Musick Point, which was reserved for the crown. Originally Eastern Beach was named Masons Beach. He sowed fine English grasses and grazed mainly sheep.<ref>LaRoche. p166.</ref> In 1850 William Mason was elected one of the three wardens of the Howick \"hundred\". The \"hundred\" was an ancient English administrative unit. He was one of three wardens who decided how the income gained for licenses to grazing cattle would be spent. The term ''hundred'' only lasted until 1865, when it was changed to Highway Trustees.<ref>The Royal NZ Fencibles 1847-52.R. Alexander. G. Gibson. A. LaRoche. Deed. Waiuku. 1997. P66.</ref> Mason bought the first flour windmill built in 1843 by John Bycroft in Auckland at Epsom (on the corner of Mindmill Rd and St Andrews Rd). Because it was some distance from the wheat farmers in the Howick district, some of them made simple mortars and pestles to grind their own flour. Later Mason moved the mill to Princess St. Onehunga in 1854, where there was a natural spring.<ref>The Royal NZ Fencbles. pp 29,30</ref>\n\nWhen The Royal New Zealand Fencibles arrived at Howick in September 1847, they were  very isolated. The Howick Fencibles established several routes to Auckland. One went to Bucklands Beach, where they were taken by a ferry across to Pt England by a farmer,  Mr Stephens. In 1852 the cutters ''Alert'' and ''Thetis'' provided a regular service between Auckland and Panmure stopping at Mr Masons at Bucklands Beach and Point England, two or three times per week. A return ticket was 4/-(shillings).<ref>The Royal New Zealand Fencibles. R. Alexander. G. Gibson. A. LaRoche. Deed. Waiuku 1997. pp 59,84,104.</ref>   Alfred Buckland, who had 21 children, bought the farm in 1861 for 2,500 [[New Zealand pound|pounds]] plus 150 pounds per annum to go to Mason and his wife Sarah, who lived another 35 years. Buckland was a successful businessman. The beach was named after him.  At one stage he owned land in the area, and also owned land situated at what is now the commercial district of [[Newmarket, New Zealand|Newmarket]]. In the late 19th century and around the turn of the 20th century, Buckland farmed ostriches at Bucklands Beach. The feathers were sold for hat decoration.\n\nThe Bucklands also had a brickmaking plant at the north end of Little Bucklands Beach near the old Bucklands Beach Yacht Club house in  1869. The brick works was owned by a Mr Spencer and managed by John Granger, who had arrived in New Zealand in 1865 to try his luck at the Thames goldfields (LaRoche 1991). He was a brickmaker by trade. Part bricks and field tiles can still be found at the northern end of Little Bucklands Beach, although many were buried by the dumping of material between the rock retaining wall and the roadside grass strip. It is possible that both bricks and field tiles were being made. The bricks were possibly used to line wells in the area. Various old wells can be found around Bucklands Beach such as at 31 and 42 The Parade, 23 Hattaway Ave next to the R.O.W., 15 Sunderlands Road, the site of an old farmstead, and by the supermarket at Highlands Park. The brickworks closed in 1878, when Granger bought the equipment and moved to Whitford Creek. The area was sometimes referred to as Grangers Point.\nOne of the first (possibly the first) buildings on Bucklands Beach was a large boathouse built on the land at 44 The Parade by Mrs Biss. The building is evident in a 1910 photo.\n\n===Development===\n\nGranger has a street in Howick named after him. In 1878 the brickworks was sold and Granger bought the equipment and set up a large brickworks at the head of the Whitford Creek in [[Whitford, New Zealand|Whitford]]. They also ran a lime factory based on crushing and burning shells at Eastern Beach. Shells lay in beds several metres thick on the flats which extend 400&nbsp;m inland from the beach. The factory was  built on a concrete base about 20 metres by 15 metres by 1.4 metres thick on the seaward side on the waterfront, 30&nbsp;m south of the intersection by the restaurant. The site is now marked by a short wooden walkway under the phoenix palm trees. The shells were burnt for 3 days at a temperature of about 800&nbsp;\u00b0C to turn the solid shells into lime when it was mixed with fresh water. The three kilns were beehive-shaped, about 1.8&nbsp;m high.<ref>History of Howick and Pakuranga. LaRoche. p. 171.</ref> Alongside the factory, a long wooden jetty went 10 metres out to deeper water. A flat-bottomed sailing scow was bought in on the high tide, loaded, then floated off on the next high tide. The shell was brought to the kilns on a miniature railway. One of the early workers at the lime works was Alexander Shaw, who had migrated from Ireland and initially worked at the Coromandel gold fields. Alexander later worked at  Granger's bricks works when it moved to Turanga (Whitford).<ref>The History of Howick and Pakuranga. p. 149. Alan LaRoche. Kyodo Printing. Singapore. 1991</ref> Workers came from Howick, walking around the Mellons Bay cliff base when the tide allowed. About 50&nbsp;m west of the beach are some noticeable depressions in the shell soil near no 19, where many hundreds of tonnes of shells were removed. The lime produced was used for mortar, lime render and for tanning leather.\n\nAnother link with Whitford was ostriches. These were brought to Whitford by the L.D. Nathan family, who had a large farm originally called Whit Forde and bred ostriches for feathers, which were a high-fashion article on hats in the 1890s. Some of the ostriches were bought by Alfred Buckland's family to Bucklands Beach, where they were grazed.\n\nThe first shop built at Bucklands beach was built by the Hindman family about 1910 on the waterfront road facing the Tamaki River called The Parade. The wooden shop was in the front with a hall at the rear. Much later it became known as the centre dairy. About 1930 the shop/hall complex was run by the Hughes family, who were bakers in Howick. They sold to the Farquar family, who lived in a small cottage on the steep section of Bucklands Beach Road near Wharf Road, above the present community centre hall. The Farquars were a military family, and about 1947 they returned to India for about a year to help in the development of the new Indian Army and rented out the cottage. Later in the 1950s it was run by the Kennedy family. Mrs Kennedy ran the local cub group that operated from the old Presbyterian church in Whitcombe Road that was removed in the 1970s.\n\nIn 1910 there were about 8 permanent houses at big Bucklands Beach. A toilet and changing rooms was built about 100m south of Hindman's store set back about 40m from the beach on The Parade. A modernized facility is still there today. The shop mainly catered for the holiday trippers who came by boat and to a lesser extent by car. In summer people would camp in tents at the base of the steep bank under the pine trees that had been planted along the cliff east of Hattaway Ave and the steep section of Bucklands Beach Road.\n\nAbout 1914 photos show the Buckland farm making use of horses to drill seed for oats, for pulling a heavy 2-horse dray (cart )when harvesting wheat and oats and for pulling a light 2-wheeled buggy called a phaeton (possibly better described as a gig). The large 2-story Buckland homestead which had a deep verandah on both sides had a large barn for hay, a pigsty, milksheds and lean-to where the buggy was stored. About 1910 a bullock team was used to pull logs from a pine plantation from Eastern Beach<ref>LaRoche p167.photo</ref> A few remaining trees from the plantation still exist on the steep slope to the north of the soccer fields at Vic Rogers Park.\n\nOn Friday 31 March 1916, Alfred Buckland and Son held an auction to sell some 126 sections on the western side of the peninsula stretching from big Bucklands Beach in the North to the cliffs at the southern end of little Bucklands Beach. The poster for the auction shows the peninsula was mainly grassland but with 3 areas of planted trees\u2014along the length of Eastern Beach, on the steep slopes east of the Bucklands Beach centreboard yacht clubhouse and on the steep cliffs east of Wharf Road. The white shell road is visible down the centre of the peninsula and the wooden wharf is clearly visible extending about 15&nbsp;m into the river. Phoenix palms were planted along Eastern Beach at this time to give the peninsula an exotic atmosphere.\n\nAfter World War I two boats owned by the Waiheke ferry company used to bring day trippers in summer to Bucklands Beach to unload at the wharf at Wharf Road. The main boat used was the launch ''Olive Jean'', built in 1919 No 136876. Another boat was the ''Olivene'', which was a sailing boat. The Buckland family, which had extensive livestock interests, would bring in cattle from the outlying gulf islands and unload them at Bucklands Beach. The cattle had to jump into the water and swim ashore to the beach. From here they were moved to be sold at Newmarket. About 1938 a cabaret, called Chez Paris, was built on the corner of Wharf Road and the Parade. It was not very successful as a cabaret due to petrol rationing in World War II and was turned into a dance hall, with a small shop at the front. A youth club was also run from the hall.\n\nBucklands Beach was served by a single bus in the 1920s and 30s known as \"the Sheik\" which ran into the city and returned with city workers. The bus was a 36-seater Daimler Charbanc operated by Mrs Laird in the 1920s. This bus was sold and used in the South Seas Exhibition of 1925-26. In the late 1920s the Otahuhu-based Passenger Transport Service operated a service from Otahuhu, Papatoetoe to Bucklands Beach until 1939. A former employee Mr Tom Hadfield took over the service and founded the Bucklands and Eastern Bus Co Ltd running buses into central Auckland. He had 2 buses loaned from the Passenger Transport Company which during wartime restrictions were converted to run on a mix of petrol and kerosine. Repairs to the buses were done at night to keep them running and the tyres pumped up by hand. The fare was 2/6 (25 cents) for adults and 2d(2-3 cents) for children. In the late 1930s a bus took youngsters to Howick to attend pictures at the Monterey Theatre. The route to Howick was via the small Pakuranga post office, which stood on farm land opposite the present western entrance to Pakuranga College. In those days Maclean Road was just a grass walking track.<ref>The History of Howick and Pakuranga. p163.</ref> The Bucklands and Eastern Bus company grew from this with its headquarters next to the bowling green at the foot of Devon Rd. From 1962 this was managed  by the Wells family who lived opposite the headquarters in Devon Road. Both the Howick and the Bucklands /Eastern buses were owned by Mrs Cherry (formerly Mrs Hadfeld).\nAbout 1940 the Roberts family who lived at Pakuranga built a brick home cookery on the corner of Devon Rd and The Parade. The Robert's daughters were both very good cooks. The bakery was very popular with American servicemen on leave during World War II.\n\n===Agriculture===\n\nFrom 1935 the central peninsula including the area of the present primary school was farmed by Pop (Herbert) and Edith Ellen Leach, Edith Leach's parents Nan and Frederick Burton, who had accompanied their daughter Edith to New Zealand in 1919 from Kent, England, and their children Allan, Bert, Gladys, Joan and Mick, who ran a dairy herd of 30\u201340 cows. The Burton/Leaches lived in the old 2-story Buckland managers homestead which was located on the rise in what is now Clovelly Road, at about number 151D. An old concrete structure referred to as the dairy was still on the site up to the 1963 development. This was a solid concrete structure about 4m by 5m by 3m high, with a wooden floor that had rotted away. The concrete used the shelly sand off a local beach. In the 1960s there was no roof left. Next to the house was a large wooden barn. The cowshed was located on the flat area near the present tennis club near Eastern Beach at about 7 Jern Place. Attached to the cowshed was accommodation for a farm worker or people on holiday at Eastern Beach. As the Leach/Burton family had the use of the large Buckland house this was not needed so the bach was let out to extended family or friends such as the Pattens over the holidays. Frederick Burton died  and the herd was sold during World War II. The Buckland house, which was in a poor state, was pulled down. The Leaches moved to a  house at 31 The Parade.\n\nThe original holiday home of Alfred Buckland, his wife  and their 13 children was a simple house  at 125 Bucklands Beach Road overlooking Eastern Beach from the ridge. The house still exists, although it has been raised and modernised.\n\nThe north tip of the peninsula, which was originally called East Head by the early settlers, was a dairy farm called Westend. The milking shed for Westend was at the lower or south end of Musick Pt Road on an area of flat land adjacent to a small creek about 50 metres from the beach. The cottage on this property (near the water tower) had fallen into decay by the 1930s and was uninhabitable -it was known to the locals as the \"rats nest\". At the south end of the peninsula were 2 farms the one on the eastern side, roughly on the same land as [[Macleans College]], was run by the Trusdale family. This was the farm originally owned by the Maclean brothers in the 19th century. In the centre of the peninsula, in the vicinity of Sea Spray Drive was a farm run by the Redgrave family and later in the 1950s, the Benton family. The milking shed was down a 100-metre drive at 205 Bucklands Beach Road.\n\nAlong with a few retired people such as Mr Morrow and Geoff Fairfield (a great grand son of the original Bucklands who lived alongside each other at the old Bucklands Beach Yacht club at 56 The Parade), these were the only permanent families at the beach although in summer many people came to stay in their [[Bach (New Zealand)|baches]]. Mr Morrow was famous for making wind driven models of people engaged in various activities such as fishing and sawing wood which he put on his front fence. He had a donations box with the money going to charity. These models were still working in the late 1950s. The most well known was a model of a woman beating a carpet with the caption below \"Work like Helen be happy\". The Leaches' cows were taken to the milking shed which was located at Eastern Beach near the present Tennis club. In the very early days there was no road to Bucklands Beach but by the 1930s roads on the beach were made of shells. After World War II the farmland at Bucklands Beach was mainly used for drystock up until 1963 when the land was subdivided for sections. The Bentons were the last farmers to actually farm the land.\nBucklands Beach has always been an attractive place for holiday makers.\n\n===Racing club===\n\nBefore World War I a steamer, the ''Wakatere'', ran from the city to the old 20-metre-long wooden jetty at the end of Wharf Road (the old piles are still visible after a storm). The Bucklands established a private oval horse race track in the flat area near Hattaway Avenue. The front straight was on Morrow Avenue and lower Devon Road was the south end of the oval. It had a permanent start/finish box elevated on piles 10 metres above the track at the lower end of Lynton Road. This was a location of the Auckland Racing Club. The first recorded meeting was in 1864 when his horse owning neighbours in Howick were invited to compete. In 1889 a [[Tote board|totalizator]] meeting was organized with the help of the Pakuranga Hunt to help celebrate the end of a severe recession. At that time the track was called the East Tamaki Racing Course. In the summers of the 1920s, car owning Aucklanders would make the long trip from the city dressed in their finery to watch the racing. In the 1920s and 1930s well-off Aucklanders such as the Pattens bought sections and constructed baches near the beaches where they lived over summer. Cliff Patten was a farrier who had strong connections with the horse racing fraternity. He worked for Bucklands Stock and Station Agents  and became familiar with the area when the Bucklands ran their annual Christmas trip by boat to Bucklands Beach in the 1920s. He built a bach by the Beach on the Parade in 1928.\n\n===World War II===\n\nDuring World War II when it was feared the city may be bombed some families moved to Bucklands Beach on a semi permanent basis. Other families at the beach then were the Burgesses, the Inders, the Hancocks and the Eliots. About 1942 just after the Japanese entered the war, the wooden bridge at Wharf road was taken down to stop a landing by Japanese. Concrete pillboxes were built at each end of Eastern Beach on the clifftops by Herbert (Pop) Leach, an ex-World War I signaler and local farmer with his sons Bert, Allan and Mick. Metal and concrete was provided by Winstones Ltd, and the material was brought to the sites by the Leach's horse-drawn sledge. The home guard with the help of the regular army set up barbed wire entanglements at local beaches. Because rumours of submarines were rife in 1941, the local home guard platoon had an exercise to walk from Mangere to Bucklands Beach. The Leach's provided accommodation in the old two-story Alfred Buckland homestead.<ref>Grey's Folly. p260. Allan LaRoche. Tui Vale 2011.</ref> In the 1950s the baby boom at the end of the war saw a growth in the number of children and a bach owned by the Trusdale family was converted into a one-room barbers shop complete with pole, on Wharf Road next to the Community Centre hall. This was known as Bert the Barbers. The barbers was demolished in the early 1960s. It was located where the present plunket rooms are now.\n\n===Postwar===\n\nThe first large-scale sale of sections took place in 1947 to take advantage of returned servicemen and the baby boom. A regular bus service took passengers to the city. The Bucklands estate lawyers sold sections for 175\u2013200 pounds. The second large sale of sections took place in 1963. Sections then cost 2000\u20132500 pounds. Walking tracks were made so that pedestrians could  walk more directly to the various beaches. These 3m wide tracks still exist today. After World War II a group of enthusiastic locals started a centreboard yacht club which was run from a portable shack stored at the community centre and carried across the road to the beach each Sunday in summer. The early classes were Z and Idle alongs on the 1950s which were gradually replaced by lighter, faster yachts such a P, Cherubs, Flying Ants and Moths in the 1970s and 80s. By the 1990s many of these classes were in turn replaced by various boardsailing classes and Optimist dinghies.\n\n==Geography==\nBucklands Beach sits at the northern end of a peninsula between the [[Tamaki River]] to the west and the [[Hauraki Gulf]] to the east. At the peninsula's northernmost point, [[Musick Point]] juts into the gulf. This was named after Captain Musick, an American who pioneered long range flying boat travel. At the tip of this peninsula is an old Maori [[P\u0101 (M\u0101ori)|P\u0101]] formerly occupied by a branch of the [[Tainui]] iwi. The Pa is sometimes referred to as Te Naupata. Some of the ancient ditches are still just visible. They should not be confused with the World War II trenches built in the vicinity of a concrete bunker. These were built after the Japanese attack on [[Pearl Harbor]] in 1941. An anti aircraft gun was located at the site to protect Musick Point long range (short wave) radio station (built in 1940). The radio communications station, one of a NZ coastal network serving aircraft and shipping, was established at the point to escape the interference experienced in the Auckland chief Post Office created by the nearby electric tram system's overhead wires. A golf course now occupies the end of the peninsula. The tip of the peninsula is a reserve open to the public. It has extensive views over the inner gulf and is a favourite location for wedding photos.\n\n===Beaches===\n\nLocals divide the beaches into:\n\n* Big Bucks (from the old yacht club at Grangers Point northwards)\n* Little Bucks (from the yacht club at Grangers Point southwards)\n* Eastern Beach\n* The Back Beach (series of small coves at the base of the cliffs north of Eastern beach). This is accessed by a steep, unstable track off Clovelly Road. This track was destroyed in a winter storm in 2009 but has been replaced by a new track in 2010 located about 500m further north.\n\n===Browns Island===\n\nFive hundred metres north off the tip of the peninsula is [[Browns Island, Auckland|Browns Island]] (Motukorea). It has a central volcanic crater which spewed lava to the SW forming a flatter area. This area was made into a stone garden by Maori in pre European times. The dark volcanic rocks were piled up to clear the ground and make walls. This created a micro climate suitable for [[Sweet potato|Kumara]] and gourds. There are many mussel beds around the SW shore so landing is difficult. The walls are still clearly visible. The best landing site is on the Northern side by the short cliff but it is protected by a number of submerged rocks. The whole island is open to the public. No commercial ferries go to the island.\n\n===Industry===\n\nAt the northern end of Big Bucklands Beach is one of the oldest industrial sites in New Zealand. At the point just south of where the beach turns to the north east, about 300 metres north of the boat ramp, is a beach area littered with stone debris from a Maori adze making \"factory\". Local historian Geoff Fairfield found fully formed or partly formed rock adzes of Ardulite (a heavy and dense volcanic rock) here in the 1960s. These were given to Auckland museum.\n\n===Estuary===\n\nThe 15 kilometres long Tamaki River to the west is a semi sheltered estuary much used by boaties especially since World War II. At its mouth the estuary is 500 metres wide but the 20-metre-deep (chart) channel is only 50 metres wide. The channel is clearly marked by large buoys as it winds its way 15 kilometres in a general southwards direction. At the large [[Point England, New Zealand|Point England]] sand spit, opposite the old yacht club, boats should keep to the 50 metre channel, as water over the spit is very shallow even at high tide. Three kilometres up the river is the large Half Moon Bay Marina, the Bucklands Beach Yacht club rooms and small shopping centre. At low water the current in the channel is very strong travelling up to 8&nbsp;km/h by the sand spit. Hundreds of small craft are moored in the river but the channel is clear. During summer the river traffic is very heavy, even at night. Ferries leave on a regular basis during the day for the city, [[Waiheke Island|Waiheke]] and [[Great Barrier Island]] from Half Moon Bay Marina. The speed limit in the river is 10&nbsp;km/h. Large vessels should watch out for small centre board yachts and windsurfers which frequent the mouth of the estuary in summer.\n\n==Population==\nIn the early days before World War II the beach had a very small permanent population centred around five farms and a few retired people, though in summer the population would be much bigger as there were many baches. After World War II the population grew steadily as the Bucklands sold off parcels of land for subdivision. When the primary school started in 1955 with a roll of about 180, the population was about 1000. The biggest growth came with widespread subdivision between 1963 and 1970. Bucklands Beach is a northern suburb of the former [[Manukau City]], which is part of the Auckland urban area. Bucklands Beach had a population of 2370 in the 2001 census.\n\n==Facilities==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}\nBucklands Beach has a number of dispersed shops and facilities. Also there is an old scout hall at the base of Devon Road. Opposite this is an outdoor bowling club. On Wharf Road is a community centre hall and [[Plunket Society|Plunket]] rooms. This was built in 1965 on the site of the old hall/dairy Chez Paris which burnt down after a fire in the cinema projection box in the 1960s.\n\nAt Eastern Beach there is a sports ground (Rogers Park) named after Vic Rogers, a long serving local member of the former Manukau County Council in the 1950s and 60s, is used for junior soccer and a tennis club and courts. On the rocky area, named Grangers Point, between Big and Little Bucklands Beach is a yacht club rooms for centre board boats, boat ramp and hauling out hard stand which was built in 1962. In 2007 a huge holding tank was constructed under the hard stand to hold the surplus sewage from beach side houses. Eastern Beach has a large Christian Youth camp which hires out its facilities to schools. At one stage the beach had three garages but all have closed now. Until the 1980s Bucklands Beach had its own post office, next to the community centre hall but this was shut down and removed by barge to Waiheke Island. In the 1950s Miss Tonks ran a library from a small building, that had previously been a garage, on the steep frontage of her property at the North end of Bucklands Beach Road near the Community hall. This little building about 4m x 3m, was so frequently crowded with customers they could barely walk around. Midway between the two restaurants at big Bucklands Beach was a dairy and hall complex called Westend (named after the farm at the tip of the peninsula). The hall was used for local dances in the 1930s and 1940s during the summer holidays.\n\nThe hall had a dairy at the front and bach style accommodation for the shop keeper. In the 1950s the hall was turned into a full size house attached to the shop. The shop had a tiny post office that was the main PO before the stand-alone post office was built just south of Chez Paris. At the Xmas dance Pop (Herbert senior) Leach, who was the normal MC, would get dressed in a Santa's costume and hide in the hall ceiling - descending by ladder to give the children presents. The old Westend building was pulled down in the 1970s. Between the 1950s and the 1970s there was a butcher's shop and a small doctor's rooms about 100 metres north of the intersection of Wharf Rd and Hattaways Ave. Both have been pulled down.\n\n===Boat Ramps===\nThere are boat ramps Eastern Beach (high tide only). This is to serve the dedicated water ski area towards the south end of the beach. A double ramp at Bucklands Beach Yacht Club (all tide) at Grangers Point for boats up to 6m. Avoid dead low tide. This ramp is exposed to the normal south to westerly wind. Not good if the wind is greater than 15 km/h. A single narrow ramp at Bucklands Beach north by the Masala restaurant (all tide) sited to boats up to 6m for confident backers. There are four ramps with loading jetties at Half Moon Bay Marina (all tide) that are well protected from the prevailing south to west wind. This last ramp is very popular and parking is an issue in the weekends.\n\n===Boardwalk===\n\nIn 2010 a new 230 metre long Warren boardwalk  has been built between the southern end of Little Bucklands Beach and the eastern end of the Half Moon Bay Marina hardstand, along the base of the Takutai Avenue cliff. The boardwalk is located on the wavecut platform that is uncovered at half tide. This  allows easy pedestrian and cycle access to the new Half Moon Bay shopping centre and joins the walkways that follows the southern bank of the Tamaki River. Weeds have been removed from the steep cliff and new native plants established.\n\n===Nearby Shops===\n\nThe nearest shopping centre and garage, with petrol, is at [[Highland Park, New Zealand|Highland Park]].\n\n==Past and present churches==\nBucklands Beach has had a wide range of churches. The oldest was St Brides, an Anglican church, constructed in the 1930s. A hall was added in 1952, built by voluntary labour headed by carpenter Mick (RR) Leach (the youngest son of Herbert (Pop) Leach. The church was moved in the 1970s. A Presbyterian Church ran in a hall between the 1950s and the 1970s when it was pulled down. Nearby at 121 Bucklands Beach Road a brick Catholic church was built by a local builder Mr Keryns in 1954. This fell into disuse in the 1970s and was purchased by Barbara Kendall (Bright) the New Zealand, World and Olympic champion board sailor, who intended to turn it into a dance studio. Because of her board sailing success it became her New Zealand home base in the 1980s. At Mobil corner, on Bucklands Beach Road, a breakaway conservative group built the Reformed Presbyterian Church which had an American pastor in the 1960s. This is still in operation. In the 1980s St Johns co-operating church was built 200 metres further south on Bucklands Beach Road. This is largely an Anglican church and is very active.\n\n==Education==\nIn the early pioneering days when most students only had primary school education. Children from Bucklands Beach attended the Pakuranga School which was located near the junction of Bucklands Beach Road and the Howick -Pakuranga Highway near the Fencibles Soccer Club. Students would often ride to school with 2 or 3 on one horse. Later when the Howick District High school was built the students went there. Attendance at school was patchy as older children were required for work on their farms.\nUntil [[Macleans College]] opened in the 1980s secondary students attended [[Pakuranga College]] adjacent to Highland Park.\n\nBucklands Beach contains many schools ranging from Primary to Secondary:\n*Bucklands Beach Intermediate (BBI)\n*Bucklands Beach Primary opened in 1955. Years 1\u20136 (formerly 1\u20138). Decile 10, with a roll of 445 students.\n*Macleans College. Decile 10 with a roll of 2500 students. Year 9 - 13. 8 houses.\n*Macleans Primary\n*Pakuranga Health Camp School opened in 1930s\n*Pigeon Mountain Primary\n*Waimokoia Residential School (Closed at the end of 2009 by the MOE. Currently unused as at March 2010, with its future undecided). The Ministry of Education has decided not to reopen the special school for children with behavioural issues after a protest from local parents concerned about the proximity of the school to 2 other junior schools. The school, which was to be renamed Thurston Place school, will remain closed.<ref>Stuff NZ. 23.4.2012</ref>\nHowick primary school opened in Feb 1955 with pupils transferring from the old Howick District High school (now Howick Intermediate). The first headmaster was Mr Hill. There were 6 classrooms, with a concrete strip in front of the rooms. Mrs Maxwell taught in primer 1 ( 5-year-olds). Other early teachers were Miss Dunn( standard 1) and Mr Thompson (form 1). Films were shown in the west end of the long corridor. During August 1955 a large storm saw the school flood due to inadequate drains. Clay water 150&nbsp;mm deep spread through the central part of the school so the school was closed for 2 days extra at the end of the August holidays. The second principal was Mr Dunstall in the 1960s.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n*Geoff Fairfield.

The suburb is in the Howick ward, one of the thirteen administrative divisions of [[Auckland Council]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Maori===\n\nThis area of Auckland was populated by [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] of the [[Ngai Tai]] iwi until the start of the [[Musket Wars]] (sometimes called the Potato Wars) which started in 1807. The old pa at Musick point was called Te Waiarohia and was used perhaps as far back as 1450. The last chief to command this pa was Te Rangi-Tauhia from about 1790. The old Maori name for Eastern Beach was Okokino; for big Bucklands Beach Te Komiti and for little Bucklands Beach Waio-otaiki. All these areas show signs of being used for Maori crops of kumara and bracken fern. These same areas had extensive hangi (earth oven) sites.<ref>History of Howick and Pakuranga. p43 Map. A. LaRoche. 1991</ref>\n\nThe Auckland area came under regular attack by [[Taua]] or war parties from the [[Ng\u0101puhi]] [[iwi]] in [[Northland Region|Northland]]. In 1821 a large musket armed Ngapuhi war party devastated the eastern area of Auckland attacking Mokoia Pa at Panmure.<ref>The History of Howick and Pakuranga. p164-166</ref> By the 1830s many of the local Maori had been killed or enslaved by their deadly enemies to the north. In 1926 Geoff Fairfield, the great grandson of Alfred Buckland and a keen historian, drew a detailed scaled map of the Pa. The main [[isthmus]] of Auckland was also depopulated by Maori migrating south to avoid the regular carnage. The [[Tamaki River]], to the west of Bucklands Beach, became a main highway for attacking Taua or those seeking revenge (utu) from previous attacks.\n\nIn 1835 minor conflict had occurred in the area and threatened to erupt into full-scale war. [[William Thomas Fairburn]], the CMS missionary, attempted to solve the issues for nearly a year. With the agreement of local Maori at a meeting at Puneke on the Tamaki River on 22 January 1836, he purchased the entire Bucklands Beach, [[Howick, New Zealand|Howick]] and [[Pakuranga]] area of {{convert|40000|acre|km2}}. The price paid to 3 local chiefs was 10 blankets, 24 axes, 26 hoes, 14 spades, $80, {{convert|1900|lb|abbr=on}} of tobacco, 24 cobs and 12 plane irons. The value of the goods was about 907 pounds and 17 shillings and 6 pence. The 3 hapu who sold the land were Ngatitawaki, Urikaraka and Matekiwaho. The principal chiefs who signed the sale were Herua, Te Waru, Hauauru and Te Tara. The Treaty of Waitangi was signed at Karaka Bay on the Tamaki River opposite Big Bucklands Beach in 1840 by Capt Hobson and Ngati Paoa.\nAfter the treaty signing the Fairburn purchase was examined by the government, who determined that Fairburn could keep 1/7 of the land, with the rest being claimed by the government, who later sold it on in smaller blocks.\n\n===Europeans===\n\nThe first European to farm this area was Fairburn, New Zealand's first architect. He sold {{convert|350|acre|km2}} to William Mason in 1851 for 500 pounds, but the deed for the land was not processed until 6 September 1852. The land included most of the peninsula apart from what is now Musick Point, which was reserved for the crown. Originally Eastern Beach was named Masons Beach. He sowed fine English grasses and grazed mainly sheep.<ref>LaRoche. p166.</ref> In 1850 William Mason was elected one of the three wardens of the Howick \"hundred\". The \"hundred\" was an ancient English administrative unit. He was one of three wardens who decided how the income gained for licenses to grazing cattle would be spent. The term ''hundred'' only lasted until 1865, when it was changed to Highway Trustees.<ref>The Royal NZ Fencibles 1847-52.R. Alexander. G. Gibson. A. LaRoche. Deed. Waiuku. 1997. P66.</ref> Mason bought the first flour windmill built in 1843 by John Bycroft in Auckland at Epsom (on the corner of Mindmill Rd and St Andrews Rd). Because it was some distance from the wheat farmers in the Howick district, some of them made simple mortars and pestles to grind their own flour. Later Mason moved the mill to Princess St. Onehunga in 1854, where there was a natural spring.<ref>The Royal NZ Fencbles. pp 29,30</ref>\n\nWhen The Royal New Zealand Fencibles arrived at Howick in September 1847, they were  very isolated. The Howick Fencibles established several routes to Auckland. One went to Bucklands Beach, where they were taken by a ferry across to Pt England by a farmer,  Mr Stephens. In 1852 the cutters ''Alert'' and ''Thetis'' provided a regular service between Auckland and Panmure stopping at Mr Masons at Bucklands Beach and Point England, two or three times per week. A return ticket was 4/-(shillings).<ref>The Royal New Zealand Fencibles. R. Alexander. G. Gibson. A. LaRoche. Deed. Waiuku 1997. pp 59,84,104.</ref>   Alfred Buckland, who had 21 children, bought the farm in 1861 for 2,500 [[New Zealand pound|pounds]] plus 150 pounds per annum to go to Mason and his wife Sarah, who lived another 35 years. Buckland was a successful businessman. The beach was named after him.  At one stage he owned land in the area, and also owned land situated at what is now the commercial district of [[Newmarket, New Zealand|Newmarket]]. In the late 19th century and around the turn of the 20th century, Buckland farmed ostriches at Bucklands Beach. The feathers were sold for hat decoration.\n\nThe Bucklands also had a brickmaking plant at the north end of Little Bucklands Beach near the old Bucklands Beach Yacht Club house in  1869. The brick works was owned by a Mr Spencer and managed by John Granger, who had arrived in New Zealand in 1865 to try his luck at the Thames goldfields (LaRoche 1991). He was a brickmaker by trade. Part bricks and field tiles can still be found at the northern end of Little Bucklands Beach, although many were buried by the dumping of material between the rock retaining wall and the roadside grass strip. It is possible that both bricks and field tiles were being made. The bricks were possibly used to line wells in the area. Various old wells can be found around Bucklands Beach such as at 31 and 42 The Parade, 23 Hattaway Ave next to the R.O.W., 15 Sunderlands Road, the site of an old farmstead, and by the supermarket at Highlands Park. The brickworks closed in 1878, when Granger bought the equipment and moved to Whitford Creek. The area was sometimes referred to as Grangers Point.\nOne of the first (possibly the first) buildings on Bucklands Beach was a large boathouse built on the land at 44 The Parade by Mrs Biss. The building is evident in a 1910 photo.\n\n===Development===\n\nGranger has a street in Howick named after him. In 1878 the brickworks was sold and Granger bought the equipment and set up a large brickworks at the head of the Whitford Creek in [[Whitford, New Zealand|Whitford]]. They also ran a lime factory based on crushing and burning shells at Eastern Beach. Shells lay in beds several metres thick on the flats which extend 400&nbsp;m inland from the beach. The factory was  built on a concrete base about 20 metres by 15 metres by 1.4 metres thick on the seaward side on the waterfront, 30&nbsp;m south of the intersection by the restaurant. The site is now marked by a short wooden walkway under the phoenix palm trees. The shells were burnt for 3 days at a temperature of about 800&nbsp;\u00b0C to turn the solid shells into lime when it was mixed with fresh water. The three kilns were beehive-shaped, about 1.8&nbsp;m high.<ref>History of Howick and Pakuranga. LaRoche. p. 171.</ref> Alongside the factory, a long wooden jetty went 10 metres out to deeper water. A flat-bottomed sailing scow was bought in on the high tide, loaded, then floated off on the next high tide. The shell was brought to the kilns on a miniature railway. One of the early workers at the lime works was Alexander Shaw, who had migrated from Ireland and initially worked at the Coromandel gold fields. Alexander later worked at  Granger's bricks works when it moved to Turanga (Whitford).<ref>The History of Howick and Pakuranga. p. 149. Alan LaRoche. Kyodo Printing. Singapore. 1991</ref> Workers came from Howick, walking around the Mellons Bay cliff base when the tide allowed. About 50&nbsp;m west of the beach are some noticeable depressions in the shell soil near no 19, where many hundreds of tonnes of shells were removed. The lime produced was used for mortar, lime render and for tanning leather.\n\nAnother link with Whitford was ostriches. These were brought to Whitford by the L.D. Nathan family, who had a large farm originally called Whit Forde and bred ostriches for feathers, which were a high-fashion article on hats in the 1890s. Some of the ostriches were bought by Alfred Buckland's family to Bucklands Beach, where they were grazed.\n\nThe first shop built at Bucklands beach was built by the Hindman family about 1910 on the waterfront road facing the Tamaki River called The Parade. The wooden shop was in the front with a hall at the rear. Much later it became known as the centre dairy. About 1930 the shop/hall complex was run by the Hughes family, who were bakers in Howick. They sold to the Farquar family, who lived in a small cottage on the steep section of Bucklands Beach Road near Wharf Road, above the present community centre hall. The Farquars were a military family, and about 1947 they returned to India for about a year to help in the development of the new Indian Army and rented out the cottage. Later in the 1950s it was run by the Kennedy family. Mrs Kennedy ran the local cub group that operated from the old Presbyterian church in Whitcombe Road that was removed in the 1970s.\n\nIn 1910 there were about 8 permanent houses at big Bucklands Beach. A toilet and changing rooms was built about 100m south of Hindman's store set back about 40m from the beach on The Parade. A modernized facility is still there today. The shop mainly catered for the holiday trippers who came by boat and to a lesser extent by car. In summer people would camp in tents at the base of the steep bank under the pine trees that had been planted along the cliff east of Hattaway Ave and the steep section of Bucklands Beach Road.\n\nAbout 1914 photos show the Buckland farm making use of horses to drill seed for oats, for pulling a heavy 2-horse dray (cart )when harvesting wheat and oats and for pulling a light 2-wheeled buggy called a phaeton (possibly better described as a gig). The large 2-story Buckland homestead which had a deep verandah on both sides had a large barn for hay, a pigsty, milksheds and lean-to where the buggy was stored. About 1910 a bullock team was used to pull logs from a pine plantation from Eastern Beach<ref>LaRoche p167.photo</ref> A few remaining trees from the plantation still exist on the steep slope to the north of the soccer fields at Vic Rogers Park.\n\nOn Friday 31 March 1916, Alfred Buckland and Son held an auction to sell some 126 sections on the western side of the peninsula stretching from big Bucklands Beach in the North to the cliffs at the southern end of little Bucklands Beach. The poster for the auction shows the peninsula was mainly grassland but with 3 areas of planted trees\u2014along the length of Eastern Beach, on the steep slopes east of the Bucklands Beach centreboard yacht clubhouse and on the steep cliffs east of Wharf Road. The white shell road is visible down the centre of the peninsula and the wooden wharf is clearly visible extending about 15&nbsp;m into the river. Phoenix palms were planted along Eastern Beach at this time to give the peninsula an exotic atmosphere.\n\nAfter World War I two boats owned by the Waiheke ferry company used to bring day trippers in summer to Bucklands Beach to unload at the wharf at Wharf Road. The main boat used was the launch ''Olive Jean'', built in 1919 No 136876. Another boat was the ''Olivene'', which was a sailing boat. The Buckland family, which had extensive livestock interests, would bring in cattle from the outlying gulf islands and unload them at Bucklands Beach. The cattle had to jump into the water and swim ashore to the beach. From here they were moved to be sold at Newmarket. About 1938 a cabaret, called Chez Paris, was built on the corner of Wharf Road and the Parade. It was not very successful as a cabaret due to petrol rationing in World War II and was turned into a dance hall, with a small shop at the front. A youth club was also run from the hall.\n\nBucklands Beach was served by a single bus in the 1920s and 30s known as \"the Sheik\" which ran into the city and returned with city workers. The bus was a 36-seater Daimler Charbanc operated by Mrs Laird in the 1920s. This bus was sold and used in the South Seas Exhibition of 1925-26. In the late 1920s the Otahuhu-based Passenger Transport Service operated a service from Otahuhu, Papatoetoe to Bucklands Beach until 1939. A former employee Mr Tom Hadfield took over the service and founded the Bucklands and Eastern Bus Co Ltd running buses into central Auckland. He had 2 buses loaned from the Passenger Transport Company which during wartime restrictions were converted to run on a mix of petrol and kerosine. Repairs to the buses were done at night to keep them running and the tyres pumped up by hand. The fare was 2/6 (25 cents) for adults and 2d(2-3 cents) for children. In the late 1930s a bus took youngsters to Howick to attend pictures at the Monterey Theatre. The route to Howick was via the small Pakuranga post office, which stood on farm land opposite the present western entrance to Pakuranga College. In those days Maclean Road was just a grass walking track.<ref>The History of Howick and Pakuranga. p163.</ref> The Bucklands and Eastern Bus company grew from this with its headquarters next to the bowling green at the foot of Devon Rd. From 1962 this was managed  by the Wells family who lived opposite the headquarters in Devon Road. Both the Howick and the Bucklands /Eastern buses were owned by Mrs Cherry (formerly Mrs Hadfeld).\nAbout 1940 the Roberts family who lived at Pakuranga built a brick home cookery on the corner of Devon Rd and The Parade. The Robert's daughters were both very good cooks. The bakery was very popular with American servicemen on leave during World War II.\n\n===Agriculture===\n\nFrom 1935 the central peninsula including the area of the present primary school was farmed by Pop (Herbert) and Edith Ellen Leach, Edith Leach's parents Nan and Frederick Burton, who had accompanied their daughter Edith to New Zealand in 1919 from Kent, England, and their children Allan, Bert, Gladys, Joan and Mick, who ran a dairy herd of 30\u201340 cows. The Burton/Leaches lived in the old 2-story Buckland managers homestead which was located on the rise in what is now Clovelly Road, at about number 151D. An old concrete structure referred to as the dairy was still on the site up to the 1963 development. This was a solid concrete structure about 4m by 5m by 3m high, with a wooden floor that had rotted away. The concrete used the shelly sand off a local beach. In the 1960s there was no roof left. Next to the house was a large wooden barn. The cowshed was located on the flat area near the present tennis club near Eastern Beach at about 7 Jern Place. Attached to the cowshed was accommodation for a farm worker or people on holiday at Eastern Beach. As the Leach/Burton family had the use of the large Buckland house this was not needed so the bach was let out to extended family or friends such as the Pattens over the holidays. Frederick Burton died  and the herd was sold during World War II. The Buckland house, which was in a poor state, was pulled down. The Leaches moved to a  house at 31 The Parade.\n\nThe original holiday home of Alfred Buckland, his wife  and their 13 children was a simple house  at 125 Bucklands Beach Road overlooking Eastern Beach from the ridge. The house still exists, although it has been raised and modernised.\n\nThe north tip of the peninsula, which was originally called East Head by the early settlers, was a dairy farm called Westend. The milking shed for Westend was at the lower or south end of Musick Pt Road on an area of flat land adjacent to a small creek about 50 metres from the beach. The cottage on this property (near the water tower) had fallen into decay by the 1930s and was uninhabitable -it was known to the locals as the \"rats nest\". At the south end of the peninsula were 2 farms the one on the eastern side, roughly on the same land as [[Macleans College]], was run by the Trusdale family. This was the farm originally owned by the Maclean brothers in the 19th century. In the centre of the peninsula, in the vicinity of Sea Spray Drive was a farm run by the Redgrave family and later in the 1950s, the Benton family. The milking shed was down a 100-metre drive at 205 Bucklands Beach Road.\n\nAlong with a few retired people such as Mr Morrow and Geoff Fairfield (a great grand son of the original Bucklands who lived alongside each other at the old Bucklands Beach Yacht club at 56 The Parade), these were the only permanent families at the beach although in summer many people came to stay in their [[Bach (New Zealand)|baches]]. Mr Morrow was famous for making wind driven models of people engaged in various activities such as fishing and sawing wood which he put on his front fence. He had a donations box with the money going to charity. These models were still working in the late 1950s. The most well known was a model of a woman beating a carpet with the caption below \"Work like Helen be happy\". The Leaches' cows were taken to the milking shed which was located at Eastern Beach near the present Tennis club. In the very early days there was no road to Bucklands Beach but by the 1930s roads on the beach were made of shells. After World War II the farmland at Bucklands Beach was mainly used for drystock up until 1963 when the land was subdivided for sections. The Bentons were the last farmers to actually farm the land.\nBucklands Beach has always been an attractive place for holiday makers.\n\n===Racing club===\n\nBefore World War I a steamer, the ''Wakatere'', ran from the city to the old 20-metre-long wooden jetty at the end of Wharf Road (the old piles are still visible after a storm). The Bucklands established a private oval horse race track in the flat area near Hattaway Avenue. The front straight was on Morrow Avenue and lower Devon Road was the south end of the oval. It had a permanent start/finish box elevated on piles 10 metres above the track at the lower end of Lynton Road. This was a location of the Auckland Racing Club. The first recorded meeting was in 1864 when his horse owning neighbours in Howick were invited to compete. In 1889 a [[Tote board|totalizator]] meeting was organized with the help of the Pakuranga Hunt to help celebrate the end of a severe recession. At that time the track was called the East Tamaki Racing Course. In the summers of the 1920s, car owning Aucklanders would make the long trip from the city dressed in their finery to watch the racing. In the 1920s and 1930s well-off Aucklanders such as the Pattens bought sections and constructed baches near the beaches where they lived over summer. Cliff Patten was a farrier who had strong connections with the horse racing fraternity. He worked for Bucklands Stock and Station Agents  and became familiar with the area when the Bucklands ran their annual Christmas trip by boat to Bucklands Beach in the 1920s. He built a bach by the Beach on the Parade in 1928.\n\n===World War II===\n\nDuring World War II when it was feared the city may be bombed some families moved to Bucklands Beach on a semi permanent basis. Other families at the beach then were the Burgesses, the Inders, the Hancocks and the Eliots. About 1942 just after the Japanese entered the war, the wooden bridge at Wharf road was taken down to stop a landing by Japanese. Concrete pillboxes were built at each end of Eastern Beach on the clifftops by Herbert (Pop) Leach, an ex-World War I signaler and local farmer with his sons Bert, Allan and Mick. Metal and concrete was provided by Winstones Ltd, and the material was brought to the sites by the Leach's horse-drawn sledge. The home guard with the help of the regular army set up barbed wire entanglements at local beaches. Because rumours of submarines were rife in 1941, the local home guard platoon had an exercise to walk from Mangere to Bucklands Beach. The Leach's provided accommodation in the old two-story Alfred Buckland homestead.<ref>Grey's Folly. p260. Allan LaRoche. Tui Vale 2011.</ref> In the 1950s the baby boom at the end of the war saw a growth in the number of children and a bach owned by the Trusdale family was converted into a one-room barbers shop complete with pole, on Wharf Road next to the Community Centre hall. This was known as Bert the Barbers. The barbers was demolished in the early 1960s. It was located where the present plunket rooms are now.\n\n===Postwar===\n\nThe first large-scale sale of sections took place in 1947 to take advantage of returned servicemen and the baby boom. A regular bus service took passengers to the city. The Bucklands estate lawyers sold sections for 175\u2013200 pounds. The second large sale of sections took place in 1963. Sections then cost 2000\u20132500 pounds. Walking tracks were made so that pedestrians could  walk more directly to the various beaches. These 3m wide tracks still exist today. After World War II a group of enthusiastic locals started a centreboard yacht club which was run from a portable shack stored at the community centre and carried across the road to the beach each Sunday in summer. The early classes were Z and Idle alongs on the 1950s which were gradually replaced by lighter, faster yachts such a P, Cherubs, Flying Ants and Moths in the 1970s and 80s. By the 1990s many of these classes were in turn replaced by various boardsailing classes and Optimist dinghies.\n\n==Geography==\nBucklands Beach sits at the northern end of a peninsula between the [[Tamaki River]] to the west and the [[Hauraki Gulf]] to the east. At the peninsula's northernmost point, [[Musick Point]] juts into the gulf. This was named after Captain Musick, an American who pioneered long range flying boat travel. At the tip of this peninsula is an old Maori [[P\u0101 (M\u0101ori)|P\u0101]] formerly occupied by a branch of the [[Tainui]] iwi. The Pa is sometimes referred to as Te Naupata. Some of the ancient ditches are still just visible. They should not be confused with the World War II trenches built in the vicinity of a concrete bunker. These were built after the Japanese attack on [[Pearl Harbor]] in 1941. An anti aircraft gun was located at the site to protect Musick Point long range (short wave) radio station (built in 1940). The radio communications station, one of a NZ coastal network serving aircraft and shipping, was established at the point to escape the interference experienced in the Auckland chief Post Office created by the nearby electric tram system's overhead wires. A golf course now occupies the end of the peninsula. The tip of the peninsula is a reserve open to the public. It has extensive views over the inner gulf and is a favourite location for wedding photos.\n\n===Beaches===\n\nLocals divide the beaches into:\n\n* Big Bucks (from the old yacht club at Grangers Point northwards)\n* Little Bucks (from the yacht club at Grangers Point southwards)\n* Eastern Beach\n* The Back Beach (series of small coves at the base of the cliffs north of Eastern beach). This is accessed by a steep, unstable track off Clovelly Road. This track was destroyed in a winter storm in 2009 but has been replaced by a new track in 2010 located about 500m further north.\n\n===Browns Island===\n\nFive hundred metres north off the tip of the peninsula is [[Browns Island, Auckland|Browns Island]] (Motukorea). It has a central volcanic crater which spewed lava to the SW forming a flatter area. This area was made into a stone garden by Maori in pre European times. The dark volcanic rocks were piled up to clear the ground and make walls. This created a micro climate suitable for [[Sweet potato|Kumara]] and gourds. There are many mussel beds around the SW shore so landing is difficult. The walls are still clearly visible. The best landing site is on the Northern side by the short cliff but it is protected by a number of submerged rocks. The whole island is open to the public. No commercial ferries go to the island.\n\n===Industry===\n\nAt the northern end of Big Bucklands Beach is one of the oldest industrial sites in New Zealand. At the point just south of where the beach turns to the north east, about 300 metres north of the boat ramp, is a beach area littered with stone debris from a Maori adze making \"factory\". Local historian Geoff Fairfield found fully formed or partly formed rock adzes of Ardulite (a heavy and dense volcanic rock) here in the 1960s. These were given to Auckland museum.\n\n===Estuary===\n\nThe 15 kilometres long Tamaki River to the west is a semi sheltered estuary much used by boaties especially since World War II. At its mouth the estuary is 500 metres wide but the 20-metre-deep (chart) channel is only 50 metres wide. The channel is clearly marked by large buoys as it winds its way 15 kilometres in a general southwards direction. At the large [[Point England, New Zealand|Point England]] sand spit, opposite the old yacht club, boats should keep to the 50 metre channel, as water over the spit is very shallow even at high tide. Three kilometres up the river is the large Half Moon Bay Marina, the Bucklands Beach Yacht club rooms and small shopping centre. At low water the current in the channel is very strong travelling up to 8&nbsp;km/h by the sand spit. Hundreds of small craft are moored in the river but the channel is clear. During summer the river traffic is very heavy, even at night. Ferries leave on a regular basis during the day for the city, [[Waiheke Island|Waiheke]] and [[Great Barrier Island]] from Half Moon Bay Marina. The speed limit in the river is 10&nbsp;km/h. Large vessels should watch out for small centre board yachts and windsurfers which frequent the mouth of the estuary in summer.\n\n==Population==\nIn the early days before World War II the beach had a very small permanent population centred around five farms and a few retired people, though in summer the population would be much bigger as there were many baches. After World War II the population grew steadily as the Bucklands sold off parcels of land for subdivision. When the primary school started in 1955 with a roll of about 180, the population was about 1000. The biggest growth came with widespread subdivision between 1963 and 1970. Bucklands Beach is a northern suburb of the former [[Manukau City]], which is part of the Auckland urban area. Bucklands Beach had a population of 2370 in the 2001 census.\n\n==Facilities==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}\nBucklands Beach has a number of dispersed shops and facilities. Also there is an old scout hall at the base of Devon Road. Opposite this is an outdoor bowling club. On Wharf Road is a community centre hall and [[Plunket Society|Plunket]] rooms. This was built in 1965 on the site of the old hall/dairy Chez Paris which burnt down after a fire in the cinema projection box in the 1960s.\n\nAt Eastern Beach there is a sports ground (Rogers Park) named after Vic Rogers, a long serving local member of the former Manukau County Council in the 1950s and 60s, is used for junior soccer and a tennis club and courts. On the rocky area, named Grangers Point, between Big and Little Bucklands Beach is a yacht club rooms for centre board boats, boat ramp and hauling out hard stand which was built in 1962. In 2007 a huge holding tank was constructed under the hard stand to hold the surplus sewage from beach side houses. Eastern Beach has a large Christian Youth camp which hires out its facilities to schools. At one stage the beach had three garages but all have closed now. Until the 1980s Bucklands Beach had its own post office, next to the community centre hall but this was shut down and removed by barge to Waiheke Island. In the 1950s Miss Tonks ran a library from a small building, that had previously been a garage, on the steep frontage of her property at the North end of Bucklands Beach Road near the Community hall. This little building about 4m x 3m, was so frequently crowded with customers they could barely walk around. Midway between the two restaurants at big Bucklands Beach was a dairy and hall complex called Westend (named after the farm at the tip of the peninsula). The hall was used for local dances in the 1930s and 1940s during the summer holidays.\n\nThe hall had a dairy at the front and bach style accommodation for the shop keeper. In the 1950s the hall was turned into a full size house attached to the shop. The shop had a tiny post office that was the main PO before the stand-alone post office was built just south of Chez Paris. At the Xmas dance Pop (Herbert senior) Leach, who was the normal MC, would get dressed in a Santa's costume and hide in the hall ceiling - descending by ladder to give the children presents. The old Westend building was pulled down in the 1970s. Between the 1950s and the 1970s there was a butcher's shop and a small doctor's rooms about 100 metres north of the intersection of Wharf Rd and Hattaways Ave. Both have been pulled down.\n\n===Boat Ramps===\nThere are boat ramps Eastern Beach (high tide only). This is to serve the dedicated water ski area towards the south end of the beach. A double ramp at Bucklands Beach Yacht Club (all tide) at Grangers Point for boats up to 6m. Avoid dead low tide. This ramp is exposed to the normal south to westerly wind. Not good if the wind is greater than 15 km/h. A single narrow ramp at Bucklands Beach north by the Masala restaurant (all tide) sited to boats up to 6m for confident backers. There are four ramps with loading jetties at Half Moon Bay Marina (all tide) that are well protected from the prevailing south to west wind. This last ramp is very popular and parking is an issue in the weekends.\n\n===Boardwalk===\n\nIn 2010 a new 230 metre long Warren boardwalk  has been built between the southern end of Little Bucklands Beach and the eastern end of the Half Moon Bay Marina hardstand, along the base of the Takutai Avenue cliff. The boardwalk is located on the wavecut platform that is uncovered at half tide. This  allows easy pedestrian and cycle access to the new Half Moon Bay shopping centre and joins the walkways that follows the southern bank of the Tamaki River. Weeds have been removed from the steep cliff and new native plants established.\n\n===Nearby Shops===\n\nThe nearest shopping centre and garage, with petrol, is at [[Highland Park, New Zealand|Highland Park]].\n\n==Past and present churches==\nBucklands Beach has had a wide range of churches. The oldest was St Brides, an Anglican church, constructed in the 1930s. A hall was added in 1952, built by voluntary labour headed by carpenter Mick (RR) Leach (the youngest son of Herbert (Pop) Leach. The church was moved in the 1970s. A Presbyterian Church ran in a hall between the 1950s and the 1970s when it was pulled down. Nearby at 121 Bucklands Beach Road a brick Catholic church was built by a local builder Mr Keryns in 1954. This fell into disuse in the 1970s and was purchased by Barbara Kendall (Bright) the New Zealand, World and Olympic champion board sailor, who intended to turn it into a dance studio. Because of her board sailing success it became her New Zealand home base in the 1980s. At Mobil corner, on Bucklands Beach Road, a breakaway conservative group built the Reformed Presbyterian Church which had an American pastor in the 1960s. This is still in operation. In the 1980s St Johns co-operating church was built 200 metres further south on Bucklands Beach Road. This is largely an Anglican church and is very active.\n\n==Education==\nIn the early pioneering days when most students only had primary school education. Children from Bucklands Beach attended the Pakuranga School which was located near the junction of Bucklands Beach Road and the Howick -Pakuranga Highway near the Fencibles Soccer Club. Students would often ride to school with 2 or 3 on one horse. Later when the Howick District High school was built the students went there. Attendance at school was patchy as older children were required for work on their farms.\nUntil [[Macleans College]] opened in the 1980s secondary students attended [[Pakuranga College]] adjacent to Highland Park.\n\nBucklands Beach contains many schools ranging from Primary to Secondary:\n*Bucklands Beach Intermediate (BBI)\n*Bucklands Beach Primary opened in 1955. Years 1\u20136 (formerly 1\u20138). Decile 10, with a roll of 445 students.\n*Macleans College. Decile 10 with a roll of 2500 students. Year 9 - 13. 8 houses.\n*Macleans Primary\n*Pakuranga Health Camp School opened in 1930s\n*Pigeon Mountain Primary\n*Waimokoia Residential School (Closed at the end of 2009 by the MOE. Currently unused as at March 2010, with its future undecided). The Ministry of Education has decided not to reopen the special school for children with behavioural issues after a protest from local parents concerned about the proximity of the school to 2 other junior schools. The school, which was to be renamed Thurston Place school, will remain closed.<ref>Stuff NZ. 23.4.2012</ref>\nHowick primary school opened in Feb 1955 with pupils transferring from the old Howick District High school (now Howick Intermediate). The first headmaster was Mr Hill. There were 6 classrooms, with a concrete strip in front of the rooms. Mrs Maxwell taught in primer 1 ( 5-year-olds). Other early teachers were Miss Dunn( standard 1) and Mr Thompson (form 1). Films were shown in the west end of the long corridor. During August 1955 a large storm saw the school flood due to inadequate drains. Clay water 150&nbsp;mm deep spread through the central part of the school so the school was closed for 2 days extra at the end of the August holidays. The second principal was Mr Dunstall in the 1960s.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n*Geoff Fairfield.
