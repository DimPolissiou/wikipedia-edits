The Metre Convention established the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (Bureau international des poids et mesures, BIPM) in [[S\u00e8vres]], France, to provide standards of measurement for worldwide use.\n\nUnder the [[Mendenhall Order]] of 1893, metric standards, developed through international cooperation under the auspices of BIPM, were officially adopted as the fundamental standards for length and mass in the United States, though some metric standards were used in practice before then.

The [[United States Department of Commerce]] conducted the study. A 45-member advisory panel consulted and took testimony from hundreds of consumers, business organizations, labor groups, manufacturers, and state and local officials. The final report of the study concluded that the U.S. would eventually join the rest of the world in the use of the metric system of measurement.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Metric America: A Decision Whose Time Has Come |url=http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Metric/4858.cfm |date=June 1992 |accessdate=December 1, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113000612/http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Metric/4858.cfm |archivedate=November 13, 2011 }}</ref> The study found that metric units were already implemented in many areas and that their use was increasing. The majority of study participants believed that conversion to the metric system was in the best interests of the United States, particularly in view of the importance of foreign trade and the increasing influence of technology in the United States.\n\n[[File:Measuring cup.jpg|thumb|left|This measuring cup, manufactured and sold in the United States circa 1980 at the height of the metrication effort, features graduations in both metric and United States customary units, with the metric graduations in front for right-handed users.]]\n\nThe U.S. Metric Study recommended that the United States implement a carefully planned transition to the principal use of the metric system over a decade. Congress passed the [[Metric Conversion Act|Metric Conversion Act of 1975]] \"to coordinate and plan the increasing use of the metric system in the United States\". Voluntary conversion was initiated, and the [[United States Metric Board]] (USMB) was established for planning, coordination, and public education. The public education component led to public awareness of the metric system, but the public response included resistance, apathy, and sometimes ridicule.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://encarta.msn.com/column_metricsystem_marthahome/Whatever_Happened_to_the_Metric_System.html |author=Martha Brockenbrough |accessdate=January 15, 2008 |title=Whatever Happened to the Metric System? |work=MSN Encarta column |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028051311/http://encarta.msn.com/column_metricsystem_marthahome/Whatever_Happened_to_the_Metric_System.html |archivedate=October 28, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 1981 the USMB reported to Congress that it lacked the clear Congressional mandate necessary to bring about national conversion.

The ANMC became a separately incorporated organization in 1976. The ANMC was intended to facilitate U.S. metrication by maintaining a voluntary and orderly process that minimizes costs and maximizes benefits, and to provide information, forums, individual assistance, and other services for its subscribers. The ANMC attempted to coordinate the metric planning of many industrial sectors, unlike the USMB, which only attempted to implement the policy set forth in the [[Metric Conversion Act]] of 1975. After the formation of the USMB, committees of the ANMC submitted conversion plans for the chemical sector and for the instruments sector. These sector conversion plans were later approved by the USMB. From 1975 through 1987, the ANMC held a series of well-attended annual conferences. Subsequently, a series of National Metric Conferences, jointly sponsored by the ANMC, the [[U.S. Metric Association]] (USMA), the Department of Commerce, and the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST), were held from 1989 through 1993.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.us-metric.org/american-national-metric-council|publisher=U.S. Metric Association, Inc|accessdate = September 3, 2015| title = American National Metric Council }}</ref>\n\n[[File:SpeedLimit-CoralRidge-MiKm-May1992 cropped.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A 1980s-vintage dual miles per hour and kilometers per hour sign, (formerly) located in Florida.

This legislation amended the Metric Conversion Act of 1975 and designated the metric system as \"the Preferred system of weights and measures for United States trade and commerce\". The legislation states that the federal government has a responsibility to assist industry, especially small business, as it voluntarily converts to the metric system of measurement.\n\nThis legislation required most federal agencies to use the metric system in their procurement, grants, and other business-related activities by the end of 1992. While not mandating metric use in the private sector, the federal government has sought to serve as a catalyst in the metric conversion of the country's trade, industry, and commerce. Exceptions were made for the highway and construction industries. The Department of Transportation planned to require metric units by 2000, but this plan was canceled by the [[Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century|1998 highway bill TEA21]]. The U.S. military has generally high use of the metric system, partly because of the need to work with other nations' militaries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Metric/upload/sd10final.pdf |title=National Institute of Standards and Technology |first=US Department of Commerce |last=NIST |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626151052/http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Metric/upload/sd10final.pdf |archivedate=June 26, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nSome members of Congress attempted to ban use of the metric system on federal highways in 1992 and 1993.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?r103:E04NO3-308:|title=Congressional Record \u2013 103rd Congress (1993\u20131994) \u2013 THOMAS (Library of Congress)}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?r102:E15SE2-437:|title=Congressional Record \u2013 102nd Congress (1991\u20131992) \u2013 THOMAS (Library of Congress)}}</ref> These bills were not popular in the House of Representatives and failed before a vote.\n\n====Mars orbiter blunder====\nThe use of two different unit systems caused the loss of the [[Mars Climate Orbiter]] in 1999.

Gerard Iannelli, director of the U.S. Metric Program, gave the opinion that Americans have so far not done so because of the effort it takes to \"translate\" from customary to metric units when both measurements are not shown.

The goal of these changes would be to encourage metric labeling, leading to greater agreement of U.S. labeling laws and simplifying domestic and international commerce. NIST Metric Program coordinator Elizabeth Gentry added that the proposed changes were \"in response to requests by U.S. manufacturers and consumers\", particularly that \"manufacturers want to take control of the limited net quantity of contents real estate on their packaging.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Proposed Rules Would Allow Metric Labeling for Some Products|url=https://www.nist.gov/pml/wmd/metric/labeling-rules.cfm|website=The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)|accessdate=March 29, 2016|date=June 16, 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn December 31, 2012, a petition was created on the White House's [[We the People (petitioning system)|petitioning system]], petitioning the White House to \"Make the Metric system the standard in the United States, instead of the Imperial system.\" On January 10, 2013, this petition garnered over 25,000 signatures, exceeding the threshold needed to require the Obama Administration to officially respond to the petition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/opinion/white-house-petitions-tech-geeks-should-sign/|title=White House petitions every tech lover should sign|date=January 5, 2013}}</ref> [[Patrick D.

The FPLA mandates bed sheets state the type of bed they are intended for in addition to dimensions in centimeters and inches. The FPLA also mandates dual scales on many other woven goods such as towels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2017/05/09/section-IVa-12-h130-final.pdf|title=Handbook 130 \u2013 2012 Uniform Packaging and Labeling Regulation|last=|first=|date=May 9, 2017|website=US National Institute of Standards and Technology|page=81|access-date=June 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Construction===\nOf all industries, construction has adopted metric units the least. [[Dimensional lumber]] comes in standard nominal inch cross-section sizes and lengths are given in feet. Although [[model building code]]s\u2014such as the [[International Building Code]]\u2014provide information in both customary and metric units, locally developed building code amendments and [[zoning]] codes often provide customary units exclusively. Because of [[Canada]]'s proximity to the U.S., issues of common units still arise. This tendency in construction is similar to [[Japan]], an otherwise metricated country where traditional construction still uses [[Japanese units of measurement|Japanese units]] predating metrication. However, blueprints commonly signify measurements using decimals (e.g., 9.2&nbsp;ft.); since feet are not divided into tenths on United States measuring tapes, builders commonly are forced to make conversions on-site that are often imprecise. In the previous example, 9.2&nbsp;ft equals 9&nbsp;ft 2.4 inches; slightly more than the 9&nbsp;ft {{frac|2|3|8}} mark on United States tape measures, though this degree of error is usually insignificant for these applications.\n\n===Aviation===\nAircraft altitudes for air traffic control and related purposes are measured in feet in the U.S. In fact, most of the world has used feet for aviation altitudes since the end of World War II (meters before 1945 in all European countries except the UK), with the notable exceptions of China, North Korea, and many [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] (former Soviet) countries. For instance, an airliner on a long flight, even if neither its starting point nor destination are in the United States, might use a nominal cruising altitude of 36,000 feet, using an internationally standardized system of [[flight level]]s (Flight Level 360 in this case). In 2011, Russia switched from metric to foot-denominated flight levels at high altitude to eliminate the need for adjustments when crossing in to or out of its airspace.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://base.consultant.ru/cons/cgi/online.cgi?req=doc;base=LAW;n=119021# |title=\u041f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u041f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0420\u0424 \u043e\u0442 05.09.2011 N 743 \"\u041e \u0432\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0438\u0437\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0432 \u0424\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0443\u0448\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0424\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438\" \u2013 \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0442\u041f\u043b\u044e\u0441 |publisher=Base.consultant.ru |date= |accessdate=December 22, 2017 |trans-title=Resolution of the Government of the Russian Federation No. 743 of September 5, 2011 \"On Amendments to the Federal Rules for the Use of the Airspace of the Russian Federation\" \u2013 ConsultantPlus}}</ref>\n\n===Commercial aviation===\nFrequent-flyer programs from commercial airlines in the United States are commonly managed using miles. This is likely to continue; in fact, some international airlines that used kilometers are switching to miles or using both, to simplify the redemption of miles with United States airline partners (Aeromexico switched from kilometers to miles, and Varig from Brazil has used miles since the program was named \"Smiles\"). Aircraft speed is often measured in [[knot (unit)|knot]]s and elevation in feet ([[flight level]]) in many countries.\n\nFor both domestic and international routes, U.S. airlines set luggage size and weight restrictions in terms of customary units. Conversely, international airlines that fly to the U.S. often restrict baggage to metric sizes.\n\nThe temperatures in aviation-related weather reports are given in degrees Celsius in the United States.\n\nFor carry-on luggage, the [[Transportation Security Administration]] restricts liquids to 3.4 fluid ounces (100 mL).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/liquids-rule|title=Liquids Rule|date=December 16, 2014|work=Transportation Security Administration|access-date=August 18, 2017}}</ref> Originally, the agency planned to restrict to 3 ounces but switched it to 3.4 oz / 100 mL after pressure from the European Union.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.tsa.gov/blog/2009/02/25/3-oz-or-34-oz-what-gives|title=3 oz or 3.4 oz?

Units of length, volume, and mass are typically introduced through comparison with ordinary objects. The metric system is not reinforced much outside the classroom due to lack of popular metric use. Consequently, while students may understand some of the concepts underlying the metric system, they do not necessarily have an intuitive sense of the value of the units.\n\nIn science education, students predominantly use metric measures in experiments and equations, allowing those interested in the sciences to become more familiar with the metric system. A few science [[Course credit|course credit]]s are requisites for an undergraduate degree in the U.S. which ensures most educated people have some exposure to the metric system.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Within [[higher education]], the metric system is universal for classes in the sciences (see [[Metrication in the United States#Science and medicine|below]]), except for exercises designed to illustrate complex conversions. Engineering programs still widely use English Engineering Units, but this varies depending on the field. Electrical Engineering programs mostly use metric, while fields such as aerospace, materials, thermal, and manufacturing engineering use customary units extensively. Some non-science textbooks in the U.S. use only the metric system without giving conversions in order to promote metrication.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n===Electricity and energy===\nThere are no U.S. customary units for electric current, potential difference, or charge since these concepts were developed after the international adoption of metric in science. The metric units [[ampere]], [[volt]], [[ohm]] and [[coulomb]] are the only units used. The SI term [[hertz]] has replaced the term ''cycles per second'' for the same unit of frequency.\n\nEnergy is often measured in [[Kilowatt hour|watt hours]] (SI-based), [[calorie]]s (SI-based), [[British thermal unit|BTUs]] (customary) or [[therm]]s (customary) rather than the SI [[joule]]. Residential and commercial electrical energy use is metered and billed in kilowatt hours, [[Kilowatt hour|kW\u00b7h]], as in most metric countries. Force measurements regularly use the [[pound-force|pound]] instead of the SI [[newton (force)|newton]]; [[torque]] is measured in [[pound-foot|pound-feet]]. Fuel prices are mostly given in customary units, such as dollars per gallon, barrel, thousand cubic feet, or ton (short or long). Heating, cooling, and combustion are often measured in BTUs per hour or [[Ton of refrigeration|refrigeration tons]] and powerplant efficiency is often measured by its \"heat rate\", in BTU per kW\u00b7hour. The rated power of [[internal combustion engine|engines]], [[electric motor]]s, and [[Power station|power plant]] [[steam turbine]]s is frequently measured in [[horsepower]]. Power plant output is generally expressed in [[megawatt]]s.\n\n===Financial services===\nSome [[commodity market]] prices are quoted in customary units (such as [[Oil barrel|barrels]] of oil, [[troy ounce]]s of gold, pounds of frozen [[Pork belly|pork bellies]], etc.). The federal government reports international production figures in metric units (for instance, wheat in metric tons) but in [[bushel]]s for domestic production figures.\n\n===Firearms===\nThe U.S. uses both the inch and millimeter for [[caliber]] on civilian and law enforcement firearms.<ref name=\"m14\">{{cite web|title=M14 |work=Nazarian's Gun Recognition Guide |accessdate=September 22, 2006 |url=http://www.nazarian.no/wep.asp?id=287 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929013417/http://www.nazarian.no/wep.asp?id=287 |archivedate=September 29, 2011 }}</ref>\nHistorically, ammunition rounds designed in the United States were denoted by their caliber in inches (e.g., [[.45 Colt]] and [[.270 Winchester]].) Two developments changed this tradition: the large preponderance of different cartridges using an identical caliber and the international arms trade bringing metric calibers to the United States. The former led to bullet diameter (rather than caliber) often being used to describe rounds to differentiate otherwise similar rounds. A good example is the [[.308 Winchester]], which fires the same .30-caliber projectile as the [[.30-06 Springfield]] and the [[.300 Savage]]. Occasionally, the caliber is just a number close to the diameter of the bullet, like the [[.220 Swift]], [[.223 Remington]] and [[.222 Remington Magnum]], all of which actually have .22 caliber or {{convert|.224|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} bullets.\n\nThe second development is actual metric calibers being introduced to the United States. 6&nbsp;mm and 7&nbsp;mm caliber rifles are particularly popular as are 9&nbsp;mm and 10&nbsp;mm caliber handguns. These metric caliber rounds are either described by their metric caliber, such as the very popular [[7mm Remington Magnum]] round or have their bullet diameter converted into inches, such as the also extremely popular [[.243 Winchester]]. Occasionally, U.S.-designed inch-caliber rounds are stated in metric as well.\n\nThe U.S. military, reflecting its need to ensure interoperability with its [[NATO]] allies, uses metric measurements for almost all weapons calibers, even for calibers that originated as or were derived from a different measurement (e.g. [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO|7.62&nbsp;mm]] rather than [[.308 Winchester|.308]], or [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO|5.56&nbsp;mm]] instead of [[.223 Remington|.223]]). However, civilian rifles chambered for .223 Remington may load military 5.56&nbsp;mm ammunition but not fire it safely because 5.56&nbsp;mm NATO ammunition is loaded to create greater chamber pressure than .223 Remington. Controversy exists whether this is true for civilian rifles chambered for .308 Winchester firing 7.62\u00d751&nbsp;mm NATO military ammunition. Major [[handloading]] manuals in the U.S. use U.S. customary units for all pertinent measurements including bullet diameter, cartridge overall length, powder charge weight, velocity, and maximum pressure, even with European-designed fully metric rounds.\n\n===Gemstones===\nGemstones and pearls are sold in [[Carat (mass)|metric carats]].\n\n===Manufacturing===\nGlobalization of manufacturing has led to wide adoption of metric standards, although this is not yet universal{{where|date=June 2015}}. After a period where [[Car|automobiles]] were assembled with both customary and metric [[fastener]]s in each vehicle, cars are now universally built with metric parts. Automobile engines were once named after their displacement in cubic inches. For example, the [[Chrysler Hemi engine|Chrysler \"426 Hemi\"]] engine would be described as 7 liters in modern terminology. Technical publications by industry publishers and American automakers often give engine displacements in cubic inches as well as cubic centimeters (which are equivalent to milliliters), or liters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/coupe/112_0506_maserati_mc12/specs_price.html |title=Maserati MC12 \u2013 Engine, Chassis, Dimensions, Price, Warranty & Performance \u2013 Road Test Review |publisher=Motor Trend |date=December 13, 2010 |accessdate=August 2, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.detroitdiesel.com/pdf/Engines/2006_S60_specs.pdf|title=Demand Detroit \u2013 Demand Detroit|website=www.detroitdiesel.com}}</ref> For example, the specifications for the Dodge SRT-8&nbsp;6.1&nbsp;L Hemi state the displacement as {{convert|370|cuin|cm3}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hemi.com/hemi.html |title=The Official Chrysler HEMI engine Web site |publisher=HEMI |accessdate=August 2, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807045824/http://www.hemi.com/hemi.html |archivedate=August 7, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Military===\nThe U.S. military uses metric measurements extensively to ensure interoperability with allied forces, particularly [[NATO]] [[Standardization Agreement]]s (STANAG).

The [[METAR]] reporting system in use in the United States differs from the one used by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO) in that [[wind]] speeds are delivered in knots (instead of meters per second), water-equivalent precipitation in hundredths of an inch, and [[flight level|altimeter setting]] in the customary inches of mercury (instead of hectopascals). Furthermore, [[temperature]]s are reported in whole degrees Fahrenheit but are converted to Celsius when encoded in METAR reports. Most synoptic observation charts are expressed in SI units, except for the aforementioned wind speeds, which must be converted for the purposes of calculation. Upper-air temperature charts typically use the Celsius scale (the freezing line is of great importance at lower levels of the atmosphere in determining precipitation type) while [[potential temperature]] charts use the [[kelvin]]; both of these are in line with international usage.{{cn|date=February 2020}} Atmospheric [[vorticity]] is typically measured in full rotations per 100,000 seconds (a rough [[metric time|metrication of the day]]) but does not use the SI-recommended [[radian]].\n\n[[National Weather Service]] and TV/radio [[broadcasting|broadcast]] public forecasts are given almost exclusively in customary units: [[degrees Fahrenheit]] for temperature and [[dewpoint]], fractions of an inch of rain or ice and whole inches of [[snow]] (less than an inch often indicated by fractions or informal terms like \"dusting\" when very low), inches of mercury; and for wind speeds, miles per hour, except in marine forecasts, in which knots are used. [[wave height|Wave height]]s are measured in feet. Actual [[ice pellets|sleet]] and snowfall and their depths on the ground are measured in tenths of an inch, with actual rainfall in hundredths, and ice accretion in either fractions or decimals. [[Hail]]stone sizes are typically reported without a fixed unit of measure; they are instead compared to familiar round or spherical items (e.g. [[dime (United States coin)|dime]]-sized or [[golf ball]]-sized). [[Barometer]] readings for [[hurricane]]s are usually given in [[millibar]]s (mb), which are equal to hectopascals (hPa), or ten times the kilopascals (kPa) used in neighboring Canada; the use of inches of mercury in such applications is rapidly declining.\n\nIn early 2007, NASA announced that it would use metric units for all operations on the lunar surface upon its return to the Moon, then projected for 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2007/08jan_metricmoon/ |title=NASA&nbsp;\u2013 Metric Moon |publisher=Science.nasa.gov |date=April 6, 2011 |accessdate=August 2, 2011}}</ref> NASA's lunar return program was then canceled in 2010.<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jan/27/nation/la-na-nasa-budget27-2010jan27 White House won't fund NASA moon program], LA Times, January 27, 2010</ref>\n\n=== Medicine ===\nThe medical field uses predominantly metric units.

Exercise is commonly discussed with patients in terms of miles walked. Intake of sugar, sodium, and other nutrients is usually discussed in terms of grams and milligrams.\n\nUse among [[veterinarian]]s varies, but because of the heavy emphasis on public interaction, animal weights (e.g., for [[Domestic cat|cats]] or [[dog]]s) are nearly always recorded and reported in pounds and ounces.

However, [[USA Track & Field]] (USATF) continued to calculate the national championships in the [[high jump]] in U.S. customary units until 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.usatf.org/statistics/USA-Champions/USAIndoorTF/women/HJ.aspx |title=USA Track & Field \u2013 USA Indoor Track & Field Champions |publisher=Usatf.org |date= |accessdate=December 22, 2017}}</ref> The [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) switched its measurement system at the [[NCAA Men's Division I Outdoor Track and Field Championships|National Championship level]] in 1976. The final holdout was the [[National Federation of State High School Associations]] (NFHS) administering high school sports, which switched to metric in 1980.\n\nThat said, U.S. track-and-field competitions are commonly run in increments of 400 meters, which roughly correspond to traditional mile-based lengths. In the Olympics, athletes run 1500 meters, not 1600 meters.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nRunning races in the U.S. are usually run in metric distances (e.g., the [[100 metres]] dash or the [[5K run]]), although the mile distance remains popular. But even 5 and 10 kilometer races most often have mile markers on the course, and no kilometer markers. Long-distance races are often measured in kilometers, although exceptions exist (generally 10&nbsp;mile races). The [[marathon]] is referred to as a 26.219-mile race (the official marathon standard distance originally being in English units&nbsp;\u2014 26 miles, 385 yards) rather than 42.195&nbsp;km. [[Ultramarathon]]s are measured in either miles or kilometers, with little standardization either way.\n\nAlthough the Olympics and U.S. track events have been metric for years, it is still common for sports commentators to provide conversions to help the American audience understand the measurements.\n\nMeasured distances as used in events such as [[shot put]], [[high jump]], and [[discus throw]] are, however, often in feet and inches, except at the national and international levels. In 2017, the Florida High School Athletic Association became the first to buck this trend and use metric measures for field events.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.athleticbusiness.com/high-school/fla-hs-track-and-field-goes-metric.html|title=Florida High School Track and Field Goes Metric \u2013 Athletic Business|last=Cameron|first=Courtney|website=www.athleticbusiness.com|access-date=August 2, 2017}}</ref> The field and court sizes for most popular team sports such as [[Association football|soccer]] were originally set in non-metric units. This is reflected in [[American football]], in which the playing field is divided into yards, and many important statistics are measured in yards. Similarly, the dimensions for all [[baseball]] parks, [[basketball]] courts, [[tennis]] courts and [[ice hockey]] rinks are given in feet, [[golf]] courses in yards, [[auto racing]] tracks in miles (or fractions thereof), and [[horse racing]] in [[furlong]]s. The lengths of automobile races in the U.S. are generally set in miles. On the other hand, some sporting equipment, such as [[ski]]s and [[ski pole|poles]], is sold in metric units.\n\nA novelty American football game was attempted in metric units in 1977.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://regressing.deadspin.com/the-liter-bowl-the-first-ncaa-football-game-to-use-the-1443414296|title=The Liter Bowl: The First NCAA Football Game To Use The Metric System|first=Kyle|last=Wagner}}</ref> That trend failed to gain a foothold.\n\nBicycles, especially at the high end, are increasingly being sold and sized in metric units.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} For example, a frame described as \"21 inch\" size in the past is now often labeled as a \"53&nbsp;cm\" frame instead.

In [[Houston, Texas]], many speed limits have km/h signs underneath the MPH signs. These are located near both airports ([[George Bush Intercontinental Airport|Bush Intercontinental]] and [[William P. Hobby Airport|Hobby]]) and in the [[Texas Medical Center]]. The U.S. territory of [[Puerto Rico]] generally uses American-style ([[Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices|MUTCD]]) signs with metric measurement on highways, displaying kilometer posts and distances in km, yet speed limit signs are in miles per hour. The [[Maine Turnpike]] has metric measurements on its highway signs in addition to customary measurements, partly to assist the large numbers of [[Canada|Canadian]] tourists who visit Maine's beaches.\n\nThe first signs in metric in the United States were posted on February 12, 1973, on [[Interstate 71]] in [[Ohio]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Rebecca|last=Goodman|title=Ohio Moments|url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2003/02/12/loc_ohiodate0212.html|work=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]|date=February 12, 2003|access-date=March 16, 2018}}</ref>\n\nGasoline and diesel fuel are sold by the U.S. gallon, and [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] is rated in miles per gallon (MPG).

Windshield wiper replacement blades are measured in inches.\n\nDomestic airline flights are assigned altitudes in feet and measure speed in [[knot (unit)|knots]]. [[Nautical chart]]s show depth in [[fathom]]s and use the [[nautical mile]] for distance. (One minute of arc of latitude at the radius of the earth at sea level was the standard for one nautical mile until about 1929. The nautical mile is now defined as exactly 1,852 meters.) Railroads use the [[standard gauge]] of 4 feet {{frac|8|1|2}} inches, as does most of Europe (where it is expressed instead as 1,435&nbsp;mm). \n[[File:Dodge Dart Speedometer.jpg|thumb|MPH and smaller km/h values on speedometer]]\nU.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 101, which governs vehicle controls and displays, permits speedometers to display miles per hour (MPH) or both MPH and km/h.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2000/05/15/00-11493/federal-motor-vehicle-safety-standards-fmvss-101-technical-correction-speedometer-display|title=Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards; FMVSS 101-Technical Correction-Speedometer Display|date=May 15, 2000|work=Federal Register|access-date=August 17, 2017}}</ref> In practice, most U.S.-market vehicles have mile odometers and dual-labeled speedometers with miles-per-hour as the primary calibration.

Other vehicles have digital speedometers which can be set to read out speeds in either MPH or km/h.\n\nAnother common unit of speed is meters per second (m/s), used especially for lifts and cable cars.

On recently introduced [[Christmas lights]], however, millimeters are often used with small [[Sphere|globe]]-shaped bulbs (G30 and G40), and with miniature [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] sets, where the standard T1\u00be ({{frac|7|32}}-inch tube) ones are sometimes called M5 (5&nbsp;mm miniature; not to be confused with [[ISO metric screw thread|M5 thread]]).\n\nFor properties understood more recently, such as those related to electricity, there is no traditional unit; international units are always used, often in combination with U.S. customary units. One among many examples is in Table 8, chapter 9, of the ''National Electrical Code Handbook (8th ed.)'', where resistance of conductors per unit length is given in ohms per thousand feet.\n\nOther units are based on customary units, but use [[Power of 10|power-of-ten]] factors and [[metric prefix]]es. For example, distance to target for a U.S. submarine is expressed in kiloyards (kyd) rather than some combination of miles, yards, and feet.

Many authors have assumed that the United States and the human race in general will use metric units; however, others have assumed the continued use of U.S. customary units or have neglected to take metrication into account. Writers sometimes use customary units simply because American readers and watchers will understand the measurements; other times, they are simply used by accident. The 1966 show ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'', for instance, initially used U.S. customary units despite multiple Earth national origins and a setting in the 23rd century. Later, starting with \"[[The Changeling (Star Trek: The Original Series)|The Changeling]]\", metric measures were used, albeit inconsistently. Later sequels of the show, such as ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', and ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' (set in the 22nd century), used the metric system exclusively.\n\nBoth the metric system and attitudes in the U.S. toward the metric system are a target of humorous jabs in shows such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'',<ref>In ''The Simpsons'', jokes about the situation are made in episodes \"[[A Star Is Burns]],\" \"[[Homer the Great]],\" \"[[The Seven-Beer Snitch]],\" and others. For instance, Abraham \"Grampa\" Simpson once remarked: \"The metric system is the tool of the devil! My car gets forty [[Rod (unit)|rod]]s to the [[hogshead]] and that's the way I likes it.\"</ref> ''[[Futurama]]''<ref>An example is in \"[[The Series Has Landed]],\" when a farmer on the Moon states that at night, the temperature drops down to \u2212173. Fry asks, \"Is that Fahrenheit or Celsius?\" to which the farmer replies, \"First one, then the other.\" Another is in \"[[I, Roommate]],\" when Calculon attempts to put a ring on Monique's finger; when it fits, she replies, \"It fits! But then, you must know that I'm&nbsp;...\" \"Metric?

The signing of this international agreement concluded five years of meetings in which the metric system was reformulated, refining the accuracy of its standards. The Metre Convention established the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (Bureau international des poids et mesures, BIPM) in [[S\u00e8vres]], France, to provide standards of measurement for worldwide use.\n\nUnder the [[Mendenhall Order]] of 1893, metric standards, developed through international cooperation under the auspices of BIPM, were officially adopted as the fundamental standards for length and mass in the United States, though some metric standards were used in practice before then. The definitions of [[United States customary units]], such as the foot and pound, have been based on metric units since then.\n\nThe 1895 [[Constitution of Utah]], in Article X, Section 11, originally mandated that: \"The Metric System shall be taught in the public schools of the State.\" This section was repealed, effective July 1, 1987.<ref>{{cite web\n| url         = http://archives.utah.gov/research/exhibits/Statehood/1896text.htm\n| title       = Constitution of the State of Utah\n| publisher   = [[Government of Utah]] (archives)\n| date        = May 29, 2002\n| accessdate  = August 2, 2011\n}}</ref><ref>See also, Senate Joint Resolution No. 1, Laws 1986 (2nd S.S.), and approved at the general election on November 4, 1986, to become effective on July 1, 1987.</ref>\n\nOn July 4, 1876, [[Melvil Dewey]] (known for his [[Dewey Decimal Classification]]) incorporated the American Metric Bureau in Boston<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sherman|first1=Jill|title=Melvil Dewey: Library Genius|date=2010|isbn=9781604537611|page=45|url=https://books.google.com/?id=YRhaX-SecK8C&pg=RA1-PA1879&lpg=RA1-PA1879&dq=American+Metric+Bureau#v=onepage&q=American%20Metric%20Bureau&f=false|accessdate=September 20, 2017}}</ref> to sell rulers and other metric measuring tools.

The [[United States Department of Commerce]] conducted the study. A 45-member advisory panel consulted and took testimony from hundreds of consumers, business organizations, labor groups, manufacturers, and state and local officials. The final report of the study concluded that the U.S. would eventually join the rest of the world in the use of the metric system of measurement.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Metric America: A Decision Whose Time Has Come |url=http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Metric/4858.cfm |date=June 1992 |accessdate=December 1, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113000612/http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Metric/4858.cfm |archivedate=November 13, 2011 }}</ref> The study found that metric units were already implemented in many areas and that their use was increasing. The majority of study participants believed that conversion to the metric system was in the best interests of the United States, particularly in view of the importance of foreign trade and the increasing influence of technology in the United States.\n\n[[File:Measuring cup.jpg|thumb|left|This measuring cup, manufactured and sold in the United States circa 1980 at the height of the metrication effort, features graduations in both metric and United States customary units, with the metric graduations in front for right-handed users.]]\n\nThe U.S. Metric Study recommended that the United States implement a carefully planned transition to the principal use of the metric system over a decade. Congress passed the [[Metric Conversion Act|Metric Conversion Act of 1975]] \"to coordinate and plan the increasing use of the metric system in the United States\". Voluntary conversion was initiated, and the [[United States Metric Board]] (USMB) was established for planning, coordination, and public education. The public education component led to public awareness of the metric system, but the public response included resistance, apathy, and sometimes ridicule.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://encarta.msn.com/column_metricsystem_marthahome/Whatever_Happened_to_the_Metric_System.html |author=Martha Brockenbrough |accessdate=January 15, 2008 |title=Whatever Happened to the Metric System? |work=MSN Encarta column |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028051311/http://encarta.msn.com/column_metricsystem_marthahome/Whatever_Happened_to_the_Metric_System.html |archivedate=October 28, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 1981 the USMB reported to Congress that it lacked the clear Congressional mandate necessary to bring about national conversion.

The ANMC became a separately incorporated organization in 1976. The ANMC was intended to facilitate U.S. metrication by maintaining a voluntary and orderly process that minimizes costs and maximizes benefits, and to provide information, forums, individual assistance, and other services for its subscribers. The ANMC attempted to coordinate the metric planning of many industrial sectors, unlike the USMB, which only attempted to implement the policy set forth in the [[Metric Conversion Act]] of 1975. After the formation of the USMB, committees of the ANMC submitted conversion plans for the chemical sector and for the instruments sector. These sector conversion plans were later approved by the USMB. From 1975 through 1987, the ANMC held a series of well-attended annual conferences. Subsequently, a series of National Metric Conferences, jointly sponsored by the ANMC, the [[U.S. Metric Association]] (USMA), the Department of Commerce, and the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST), were held from 1989 through 1993.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.us-metric.org/american-national-metric-council|publisher=U.S. Metric Association, Inc|accessdate = September 3, 2015| title = American National Metric Council }}</ref>\n\n[[File:SpeedLimit-CoralRidge-MiKm-May1992 cropped.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A 1980s-vintage dual miles per hour and kilometers per hour sign, (formerly) located in Florida.

This legislation amended the Metric Conversion Act of 1975 and designated the metric system as \"the Preferred system of weights and measures for United States trade and commerce\". The legislation states that the federal government has a responsibility to assist industry, especially small business, as it voluntarily converts to the metric system of measurement.\n\nThis legislation required most federal agencies to use the metric system in their procurement, grants, and other business-related activities by the end of 1992. While not mandating metric use in the private sector, the federal government has sought to serve as a catalyst in the metric conversion of the country's trade, industry, and commerce. Exceptions were made for the highway and construction industries. The Department of Transportation planned to require metric units by 2000, but this plan was canceled by the [[Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century|1998 highway bill TEA21]].

In some northern [[Canada\u2013United States border|border states]], temperatures are described in both Fahrenheit and Celsius for the benefit of the cross-border Canadian audiences.\n\n[[NOAA Weather Radio]] broadcasts from the [[National Weather Service]] in the [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul|Twin Cities]] of Minnesota provide the local temperature reports in Fahrenheit and in Celsius, as does [[WXL57]] weather radio in [[Des Moines, Iowa]].\n\n===Consumer and retail===\n[[File:Shampoo Net Quantity.jpg|thumb|211x211px|A shampoo bottle labeled with mL first and fl oz second. Note the [[Estimated sign|\u212e]] estimated net quantity symbol indicates the product also conforms to European Union regulations.]]\nSome U.S. consumer products come in rounded metric sizes. This appears to be increasing because of the international nature of manufacturing, distribution, and sales. Many items are produced in rounded metric quantities and some manufacturers opt to display the metric quantity first or more prominently (e.g., [[Crest Glide]] [[dental floss]] is available in 35-, 40-, and 50-meter packages).\n\nPerhaps the most common metric item sold is the [[two-liter bottle]]. Some [[supermarket]] chains also make their [[store brand]] soft drinks available in 3-liter sizes. Soft drink containers of 1 and 0.5 liters (and more recently 1.25 liter bottles) are sometimes sold alongside 12 [[fluid ounce|fl&nbsp;oz]], 16 fl&nbsp;oz, 20 fl&nbsp;oz, and 24 fl&nbsp;oz (355, 473, 591 and 710&nbsp;mL) sizes.\n\nThe half-liter water bottle (16.9 fl oz) has nearly replaced the 16 ounce size. 700&nbsp;mL (23.6 fl oz) and one-liter sizes are also common, though 20 fl&nbsp;oz, and 24 fl&nbsp;oz sizes remain popular, particularly in vending machines.\n\nAttempts to sell 3- or 4-liter jugs of [[milk]], instead of [[gallon]]s (3.785 L), have been largely unsuccessful, and such bottles are rarely seen in the United States. Milk remains sold in binary divisions of the gallon, with half-pints, [[pint]]s, [[quart]]s and half-gallons being the primary sizes.\n\n[[Shampoo]], [[mouthwash]], and [[dental floss]] have begun to be sold in metric sizes. [[PowerBar]]s and similar products have always been sold (but not marketed) by the gram.\n\n[[Nutrition facts label|Nutritional food labels]] typically report serving sizes in both systems but only list metric values (g or mg) for the breakdown of individual nutrients.\n\n==== Alcohol ====\nWine is sold in standard bottles of 750&nbsp;mL, as in the rest of the world. A fifth of liquor, once one-fifth of a U.S. gallon, or 757&nbsp;mL, is now commonly 750&nbsp;mL, though it is still referred to as \"a fifth\". Beer is sold in fluid ounce denominations. Regulations are set by the [[Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau]] which controls the permissible sizes of containers.

[[Compact disc|CDs]] and [[DVD]]s are 120&nbsp;mm in diameter, but their size is rarely mentioned; [[mini CD]]s are sometimes called 80mm CDs.\n\nComputer fan sizes are exclusively referred to by metric units (120&nbsp;mm or 80&nbsp;mm case fans, for example), while [[hard disk drive]] and CD drive bay widths are customary measurements, typically 3{{1/2}} inches and 5{{1/4}} inches, respectively.\n\nConsumer-size [[photographic film]] was commonly sold in a [[35mm format|35 mm standard]] (24\u00d736&nbsp;mm negative), although print sizes and [[Large format (photography)|large format]] films are defined in inches. [[Optical format|Digital camera sensor sizes]] are measured in an archaic manner indicating inverse fractions of an inch representing the diameter of an equivalent [[vidicon]] tube. For example, a {{frac|1|1.6&nbsp;in}} sensor is larger than a {{frac|1|2.5&nbsp;in}} sensor. However, lenses are marked in terms of focal length in millimeters (e.g., average natural human field of view is a lens with 50&nbsp;mm focal length for 35&nbsp;mm film).\n\n==== Clothing ====\nClothing is measured in inches, not [[centimeters]]. American [[Shoe size|shoes sizes]] are measured on different scales for children, men, and women but all sizes are derived from inches.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wikihow.com/Find-Your-Shoe-Size|title=How to Find Your Shoe Size|work=wikiHow|access-date=August 18, 2017}}</ref> Major multi-national apparel brands including [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Adidas]], [[Hanesbrands|Hanes]], and [[Levi Strauss & Co.|Levi's]] often sell the same inventory worldwide, with tags containing both SI and customary units in addition to [[Laundry symbol|laundry care symbols]] and instructions in many languages.\n\n==== Bedding ====\n[[Bed size|Mattress sizes]] use non-numeric labels, such as king, queen, full, or twin. These sizes are defined in inches, unlike most other countries, which use similar labels defined using metric units. The FPLA mandates bed sheets state the type of bed they are intended for in addition to dimensions in centimeters and inches. The FPLA also mandates dual scales on many other woven goods such as towels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2017/05/09/section-IVa-12-h130-final.pdf|title=Handbook 130 \u2013 2012 Uniform Packaging and Labeling Regulation|last=|first=|date=May 9, 2017|website=US National Institute of Standards and Technology|page=81|access-date=June 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Construction===\nOf all industries, construction has adopted metric units the least. [[Dimensional lumber]] comes in standard nominal inch cross-section sizes and lengths are given in feet. Although [[model building code]]s\u2014such as the [[International Building Code]]\u2014provide information in both customary and metric units, locally developed building code amendments and [[zoning]] codes often provide customary units exclusively. Because of [[Canada]]'s proximity to the U.S., issues of common units still arise. This tendency in construction is similar to [[Japan]], an otherwise metricated country where traditional construction still uses [[Japanese units of measurement|Japanese units]] predating metrication. However, blueprints commonly signify measurements using decimals (e.g., 9.2&nbsp;ft.); since feet are not divided into tenths on United States measuring tapes, builders commonly are forced to make conversions on-site that are often imprecise. In the previous example, 9.2&nbsp;ft equals 9&nbsp;ft 2.4 inches; slightly more than the 9&nbsp;ft {{frac|2|3|8}} mark on United States tape measures, though this degree of error is usually insignificant for these applications.\n\n===Aviation===\nAircraft altitudes for air traffic control and related purposes are measured in feet in the U.S. In fact, most of the world has used feet for aviation altitudes since the end of World War II (meters before 1945 in all European countries except the UK), with the notable exceptions of China, North Korea, and many [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] (former Soviet) countries. For instance, an airliner on a long flight, even if neither its starting point nor destination are in the United States, might use a nominal cruising altitude of 36,000 feet, using an internationally standardized system of [[flight level]]s (Flight Level 360 in this case). In 2011, Russia switched from metric to foot-denominated flight levels at high altitude to eliminate the need for adjustments when crossing in to or out of its airspace.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://base.consultant.ru/cons/cgi/online.cgi?req=doc;base=LAW;n=119021# |title=\u041f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u041f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0420\u0424 \u043e\u0442 05.09.2011 N 743 \"\u041e \u0432\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0438\u0437\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0432 \u0424\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0443\u0448\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0424\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438\" \u2013 \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0442\u041f\u043b\u044e\u0441 |publisher=Base.consultant.ru |date= |accessdate=December 22, 2017 |trans-title=Resolution of the Government of the Russian Federation No. 743 of September 5, 2011 \"On Amendments to the Federal Rules for the Use of the Airspace of the Russian Federation\" \u2013 ConsultantPlus}}</ref>\n\n===Commercial aviation===\nFrequent-flyer programs from commercial airlines in the United States are commonly managed using miles. This is likely to continue; in fact, some international airlines that used kilometers are switching to miles or using both, to simplify the redemption of miles with United States airline partners (Aeromexico switched from kilometers to miles, and Varig from Brazil has used miles since the program was named \"Smiles\"). Aircraft speed is often measured in [[knot (unit)|knot]]s and elevation in feet ([[flight level]]) in many countries.\n\nFor both domestic and international routes, U.S. airlines set luggage size and weight restrictions in terms of customary units. Conversely, international airlines that fly to the U.S. often restrict baggage to metric sizes.\n\nThe temperatures in aviation-related weather reports are given in degrees Celsius in the United States.\n\nFor carry-on luggage, the [[Transportation Security Administration]] restricts liquids to 3.4 fluid ounces (100 mL).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/liquids-rule|title=Liquids Rule|date=December 16, 2014|work=Transportation Security Administration|access-date=August 18, 2017}}</ref> Originally, the agency planned to restrict to 3 ounces but switched it to 3.4 oz / 100 mL after pressure from the European Union.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.tsa.gov/blog/2009/02/25/3-oz-or-34-oz-what-gives|title=3 oz or 3.4 oz?

Units of length, volume, and mass are typically introduced through comparison with ordinary objects. The metric system is not reinforced much outside the classroom due to lack of popular metric use. Consequently, while students may understand some of the concepts underlying the metric system, they do not necessarily have an intuitive sense of the value of the units.\n\nIn science education, students predominantly use metric measures in experiments and equations, allowing those interested in the sciences to become more familiar with the metric system. A few science [[Course credit|course credit]]s are requisites for an undergraduate degree in the U.S. which ensures most educated people have some exposure to the metric system.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Within [[higher education]], the metric system is universal for classes in the sciences (see [[Metrication in the United States#Science and medicine|below]]), except for exercises designed to illustrate complex conversions. Engineering programs still widely use English Engineering Units, but this varies depending on the field. Electrical Engineering programs mostly use metric, while fields such as aerospace, materials, thermal, and manufacturing engineering use customary units extensively. Some non-science textbooks in the U.S. use only the metric system without giving conversions in order to promote metrication.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n===Electricity and energy===\nThere are no U.S. customary units for electric current, potential difference, or charge since these concepts were developed after the international adoption of metric in science. The metric units [[ampere]], [[volt]], [[ohm]] and [[coulomb]] are the only units used. The SI term [[hertz]] has replaced the term ''cycles per second'' for the same unit of frequency.\n\nEnergy is often measured in [[Kilowatt hour|watt hours]] (SI-based), [[calorie]]s (SI-based), [[British thermal unit|BTUs]] (customary) or [[therm]]s (customary) rather than the SI [[joule]]. Residential and commercial electrical energy use is metered and billed in kilowatt hours, [[Kilowatt hour|kW\u00b7h]], as in most metric countries. Force measurements regularly use the [[pound-force|pound]] instead of the SI [[newton (force)|newton]]; [[torque]] is measured in [[pound-foot|pound-feet]]. Fuel prices are mostly given in customary units, such as dollars per gallon, barrel, thousand cubic feet, or ton (short or long). Heating, cooling, and combustion are often measured in BTUs per hour or [[Ton of refrigeration|refrigeration tons]] and powerplant efficiency is often measured by its \"heat rate\", in BTU per kW\u00b7hour. The rated power of [[internal combustion engine|engines]], [[electric motor]]s, and [[Power station|power plant]] [[steam turbine]]s is frequently measured in [[horsepower]]. Power plant output is generally expressed in [[megawatt]]s.\n\n===Financial services===\nSome [[commodity market]] prices are quoted in customary units (such as [[Oil barrel|barrels]] of oil, [[troy ounce]]s of gold, pounds of frozen [[Pork belly|pork bellies]], etc.). The federal government reports international production figures in metric units (for instance, wheat in metric tons) but in [[bushel]]s for domestic production figures.\n\n===Firearms===\nThe U.S. uses both the inch and millimeter for [[caliber]] on civilian and law enforcement firearms.<ref name=\"m14\">{{cite web|title=M14 |work=Nazarian's Gun Recognition Guide |accessdate=September 22, 2006 |url=http://www.nazarian.no/wep.asp?id=287 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929013417/http://www.nazarian.no/wep.asp?id=287 |archivedate=September 29, 2011 }}</ref>\nHistorically, ammunition rounds designed in the United States were denoted by their caliber in inches (e.g., [[.45 Colt]] and [[.270 Winchester]].) Two developments changed this tradition: the large preponderance of different cartridges using an identical caliber and the international arms trade bringing metric calibers to the United States. The former led to bullet diameter (rather than caliber) often being used to describe rounds to differentiate otherwise similar rounds. A good example is the [[.308 Winchester]], which fires the same .30-caliber projectile as the [[.30-06 Springfield]] and the [[.300 Savage]]. Occasionally, the caliber is just a number close to the diameter of the bullet, like the [[.220 Swift]], [[.223 Remington]] and [[.222 Remington Magnum]], all of which actually have .22 caliber or {{convert|.224|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} bullets.\n\nThe second development is actual metric calibers being introduced to the United States. 6&nbsp;mm and 7&nbsp;mm caliber rifles are particularly popular as are 9&nbsp;mm and 10&nbsp;mm caliber handguns. These metric caliber rounds are either described by their metric caliber, such as the very popular [[7mm Remington Magnum]] round or have their bullet diameter converted into inches, such as the also extremely popular [[.243 Winchester]]. Occasionally, U.S.-designed inch-caliber rounds are stated in metric as well.\n\nThe U.S. military, reflecting its need to ensure interoperability with its [[NATO]] allies, uses metric measurements for almost all weapons calibers, even for calibers that originated as or were derived from a different measurement (e.g. [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO|7.62&nbsp;mm]] rather than [[.308 Winchester|.308]], or [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO|5.56&nbsp;mm]] instead of [[.223 Remington|.223]]). However, civilian rifles chambered for .223 Remington may load military 5.56&nbsp;mm ammunition but not fire it safely because 5.56&nbsp;mm NATO ammunition is loaded to create greater chamber pressure than .223 Remington. Controversy exists whether this is true for civilian rifles chambered for .308 Winchester firing 7.62\u00d751&nbsp;mm NATO military ammunition. Major [[handloading]] manuals in the U.S. use U.S. customary units for all pertinent measurements including bullet diameter, cartridge overall length, powder charge weight, velocity, and maximum pressure, even with European-designed fully metric rounds.\n\n===Gemstones===\nGemstones and pearls are sold in [[Carat (mass)|metric carats]].\n\n===Manufacturing===\nGlobalization of manufacturing has led to wide adoption of metric standards, although this is not yet universal{{where|date=June 2015}}. After a period where [[Car|automobiles]] were assembled with both customary and metric [[fastener]]s in each vehicle, cars are now universally built with metric parts. Automobile engines were once named after their displacement in cubic inches. For example, the [[Chrysler Hemi engine|Chrysler \"426 Hemi\"]] engine would be described as 7 liters in modern terminology. Technical publications by industry publishers and American automakers often give engine displacements in cubic inches as well as cubic centimeters (which are equivalent to milliliters), or liters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/coupe/112_0506_maserati_mc12/specs_price.html |title=Maserati MC12 \u2013 Engine, Chassis, Dimensions, Price, Warranty & Performance \u2013 Road Test Review |publisher=Motor Trend |date=December 13, 2010 |accessdate=August 2, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.detroitdiesel.com/pdf/Engines/2006_S60_specs.pdf|title=Demand Detroit \u2013 Demand Detroit|website=www.detroitdiesel.com}}</ref> For example, the specifications for the Dodge SRT-8&nbsp;6.1&nbsp;L Hemi state the displacement as {{convert|370|cuin|cm3}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hemi.com/hemi.html |title=The Official Chrysler HEMI engine Web site |publisher=HEMI |accessdate=August 2, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807045824/http://www.hemi.com/hemi.html |archivedate=August 7, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Military===\nThe U.S. military uses metric measurements extensively to ensure interoperability with allied forces, particularly [[NATO]] [[Standardization Agreement]]s (STANAG).

The [[METAR]] reporting system in use in the United States differs from the one used by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO) in that [[wind]] speeds are delivered in knots (instead of meters per second), water-equivalent precipitation in hundredths of an inch, and [[flight level|altimeter setting]] in the customary inches of mercury (instead of hectopascals). Furthermore, [[temperature]]s are reported in whole degrees Fahrenheit but are converted to Celsius when encoded in METAR reports. Most synoptic observation charts are expressed in SI units, except for the aforementioned wind speeds, which must be converted for the purposes of calculation. Upper-air temperature charts typically use the Celsius scale (the freezing line is of great importance at lower levels of the atmosphere in determining precipitation type) while [[potential temperature]] charts use the [[kelvin]]; both of these are in line with international usage.{{cn|date=February 2020}} Atmospheric [[vorticity]] is typically measured in full rotations per 100,000 seconds (a rough [[metric time|metrication of the day]]) but does not use the SI-recommended [[radian]].\n\n[[National Weather Service]] and TV/radio [[broadcasting|broadcast]] public forecasts are given almost exclusively in customary units: [[degrees Fahrenheit]] for temperature and [[dewpoint]], fractions of an inch of rain or ice and whole inches of [[snow]] (less than an inch often indicated by fractions or informal terms like \"dusting\" when very low), inches of mercury; and for wind speeds, miles per hour, except in marine forecasts, in which knots are used. [[wave height|Wave height]]s are measured in feet. Actual [[ice pellets|sleet]] and snowfall and their depths on the ground are measured in tenths of an inch, with actual rainfall in hundredths, and ice accretion in either fractions or decimals. [[Hail]]stone sizes are typically reported without a fixed unit of measure; they are instead compared to familiar round or spherical items (e.g. [[dime (United States coin)|dime]]-sized or [[golf ball]]-sized). [[Barometer]] readings for [[hurricane]]s are usually given in [[millibar]]s (mb), which are equal to hectopascals (hPa), or ten times the kilopascals (kPa) used in neighboring Canada; the use of inches of mercury in such applications is rapidly declining.\n\nIn early 2007, NASA announced that it would use metric units for all operations on the lunar surface upon its return to the Moon, then projected for 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2007/08jan_metricmoon/ |title=NASA&nbsp;\u2013 Metric Moon |publisher=Science.nasa.gov |date=April 6, 2011 |accessdate=August 2, 2011}}</ref> NASA's lunar return program was then canceled in 2010.<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jan/27/nation/la-na-nasa-budget27-2010jan27 White House won't fund NASA moon program], LA Times, January 27, 2010</ref>\n\n=== Medicine ===\nThe medical field uses predominantly metric units.

The final holdout was the [[National Federation of State High School Associations]] (NFHS) administering high school sports, which switched to metric in 1980.\n\nThat said, U.S. track-and-field competitions are commonly run in increments of 400 meters, which roughly correspond to traditional mile-based lengths. In the Olympics, athletes run 1500 meters, not 1600 meters.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nRunning races in the U.S. are usually run in metric distances (e.g., the [[100 metres]] dash or the [[5K run]]), although the mile distance remains popular. But even 5 and 10 kilometer races most often have mile markers on the course, and no kilometer markers. Long-distance races are often measured in kilometers, although exceptions exist (generally 10&nbsp;mile races). The [[marathon]] is referred to as a 26.219-mile race (the official marathon standard distance originally being in English units&nbsp;\u2014 26 miles, 385 yards) rather than 42.195&nbsp;km. [[Ultramarathon]]s are measured in either miles or kilometers, with little standardization either way.\n\nAlthough the Olympics and U.S. track events have been metric for years, it is still common for sports commentators to provide conversions to help the American audience understand the measurements.\n\nMeasured distances as used in events such as [[shot put]], [[high jump]], and [[discus throw]] are, however, often in feet and inches, except at the national and international levels. In 2017, the Florida High School Athletic Association became the first to buck this trend and use metric measures for field events.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.athleticbusiness.com/high-school/fla-hs-track-and-field-goes-metric.html|title=Florida High School Track and Field Goes Metric \u2013 Athletic Business|last=Cameron|first=Courtney|website=www.athleticbusiness.com|access-date=August 2, 2017}}</ref> The field and court sizes for most popular team sports such as [[Association football|soccer]] were originally set in non-metric units. This is reflected in [[American football]], in which the playing field is divided into yards, and many important statistics are measured in yards. Similarly, the dimensions for all [[baseball]] parks, [[basketball]] courts, [[tennis]] courts and [[ice hockey]] rinks are given in feet, [[golf]] courses in yards, [[auto racing]] tracks in miles (or fractions thereof), and [[horse racing]] in [[furlong]]s. The lengths of automobile races in the U.S. are generally set in miles.

On recently introduced [[Christmas lights]], however, millimeters are often used with small [[Sphere|globe]]-shaped bulbs (G30 and G40), and with miniature [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] sets, where the standard T1\u00be ({{frac|7|32}}-inch tube) ones are sometimes called M5 (5&nbsp;mm miniature; not to be confused with [[ISO metric screw thread|M5 thread]]).\n\nFor properties understood more recently, such as those related to electricity, there is no traditional unit; international units are always used, often in combination with U.S. customary units. One among many examples is in Table 8, chapter 9, of the ''National Electrical Code Handbook (8th ed.)'', where resistance of conductors per unit length is given in ohms per thousand feet.\n\nOther units are based on customary units, but use [[Power of 10|power-of-ten]] factors and [[metric prefix]]es. For example, distance to target for a U.S. submarine is expressed in kiloyards (kyd) rather than some combination of miles, yards, and feet. Telephone transmission line length and loop distances are measured in kilofeet.<ref>AT&T, ''Telecommunication Transmission Engineering'', Volume 2 \u2013 ''Facilities'', Bell Center for Technical Education (1977)</ref> In some fields of [[civil engineering]] (especially [[structural engineering]]), and [[architecture]], large loads and forces (such as the weight of a building or the amount of load applied to a column) are measured in [[kip (unit)|kips]] (kilopounds or 1000 [[pounds-force]]) instead of [[Short ton-force|short tons-force]] (2000 pounds-force), which are used in virtually all other non-metric industries in the United States, as well as in common usage among the public, when dealing with large values of force.\n\n==Cultural impact==\nThe continuing use of U.S. customary units has caused writers to speculate in fiction set in the future about the adoption of the metric system. Many authors have assumed that the United States and the human race in general will use metric units; however, others have assumed the continued use of U.S. customary units or have neglected to take metrication into account. Writers sometimes use customary units simply because American readers and watchers will understand the measurements; other times, they are simply used by accident. The 1966 show ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'', for instance, initially used U.S. customary units despite multiple Earth national origins and a setting in the 23rd century. Later, starting with \"[[The Changeling (Star Trek: The Original Series)|The Changeling]]\", metric measures were used, albeit inconsistently. Later sequels of the show, such as ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', and ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' (set in the 22nd century), used the metric system exclusively.\n\nBoth the metric system and attitudes in the U.S. toward the metric system are a target of humorous jabs in shows such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'',<ref>In ''The Simpsons'', jokes about the situation are made in episodes \"[[A Star Is Burns]],\" \"[[Homer the Great]],\" \"[[The Seven-Beer Snitch]],\" and others. For instance, Abraham \"Grampa\" Simpson once remarked: \"The metric system is the tool of the devil! My car gets forty [[Rod (unit)|rod]]s to the [[hogshead]] and that's the way I likes it.\"</ref> ''[[Futurama]]''<ref>An example is in \"[[The Series Has Landed]],\" when a farmer on the Moon states that at night, the temperature drops down to \u2212173. Fry asks, \"Is that Fahrenheit or Celsius?\" to which the farmer replies, \"First one, then the other.\" Another is in \"[[I, Roommate]],\" when Calculon attempts to put a ring on Monique's finger; when it fits, she replies, \"It fits! But then, you must know that I'm&nbsp;...\" \"Metric? I've always known, but for you, my darling, I'm willing to convert.\"</ref> and ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]''.<ref>Season 4 Episode 07 \"[[Apology Insufficiency]]\"; Sheldon: \"Ethyl alcohol. 40 milliliters.\" Penny: \"I'm sorry, honey, I don't know milliliters.\" Sheldon: \"Ah. I blame President James \"Jimmy\" Carter. He started America on a path to the metric system but then just gave up. He wonders why he was a one-term president.\"</ref> A ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' sketch titled \"Decabet\", released at the height of the metrication movement, lampooned the different metric measurements by introducing a new alphabet consisting of only ten letters.\n\nIn the 1994 film ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'', Vincent Vega ([[John Travolta]]) tells Jules Winnfield ([[Samuel L. Jackson]]) that \"Europe is a little different\", because for example in [[Paris]], they don't call it a \"[[Quarter Pounder]] with Cheese\" but a \"Royale with Cheese\" as \"they've got the metric system, they don't know what the fuck a Quarter Pounder is\". Later, Jules compliments the intelligence of one of their victims, after he correctly surmises that [[France|French]] use of the metric system is what precludes the term \"Quarter Pounder.\"\n\nIn the \"The Martian\" (Ridley Scott film) the dialogue for the aproach between \"Hermes\" and Ares ship to rescue astronaut Mark Watney is whole in metric units. \n\n''[[Popular Science]]''<nowiki/>'s September 2003 edition listed NIST's \"Metric System Advocate\" on its list of the \"Worst Jobs in Science\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Speed |first=William |url=http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2003-09/worst-jobs-science-2003 |title=The Worst Jobs in Science 2003 &#124; Popular Science |publisher=Popsci.com |date= |accessdate=August 2, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[U.S. Metric Association]]\n* [[Frank Mankiewicz#Anti-metrication|Frank Mankiewicz]]\n* [[History of the metric system]]\n* [[Lyn Nofziger#Anti-metrication|Lyn Nofziger]]\n* [[Metrication in Australia]]\n* [[Metrication in Canada]]\n* [[Metrication in New Zealand]]\n* [[Metrication in the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Metrication opposition]]\n* [[Plan for Establishing Uniformity in the Coinage, Weights, and Measures of the United States|Plan for Establishing Uniformity in the USA]], 1790 report including proposal for decimal system based on the foot\n* [[The Metric Marvels]]\n* [[United States customary units]]\n* [[Public Land Survey System|United States Public Land Survey System]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20111209113714/http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Metric/lc1136a.cfm The United States and the Metric System (LC 1136) nist.gov] Archive.org\n* [http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/usmetric.html The Metric System in the United States]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20111113000612/http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Metric/4858.cfm A Metric America: A Decision Whose Time Has Come on nist.gov] Archive.org\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20111105080437/http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/Metric/pub814.cfm#act Metric Conversion Act of 1975 on nist.gov] Archive.org\n* [http://www.us-metric.org www.us-metric.org]&nbsp;\u2014 U.S. Metric Association ([http://www.metric.org/ mirror link])\n* [http://internetoracle.org/bestof.cgi?N=351-375#365-10 Mean Mr Metric] satire about the (non)conversion to metric units.

His clashes with officials of the Ministry of Education, school inspectors, ward assemblymen, city councilmen, and top officials of the city of Tokyo were frequent and resulted in frequent transfers between schools.<ref>Murata, Kiyoaki. ''Japan's New Buddhism: An Objective Account of Soka Gakkai.''

A Geography of Human Life. Ed. by Dayle M. Bethel. Caddo Gap Press, 2002, p25</ref> In this work, Makiguchi also formulated the concept of humanitarian competition as an approach to international relations, writing that: \"The important thing is the setting of a goal of well being and protection of all people, including oneself but not at the increase of self-interest alone. In other words, the aim is the betterment of others and in doing so, one chooses ways that will yield personal benefit as well as benefits to others. It is a conscious effort to create a more harmonious community life.\"<ref>Makiguchi. A Geography of Human Life. p.286</ref> This publication is one of, if not the, earliest set of ideas in the global modern environmental movement.\n\nIn response to problems throughout the education system that resulted from the Meiji government's adoption of the [[Imperial Rescript]], Makiguchi published the first volume of ''S\u014dka Ky\u014dikugaku Taikei'' (''The System of Value-Creation Pedagogy'') together with his close friend and disciple [[J\u014dsei Toda]] on November 18, 1930.<ref>Kumagaki, Kazunori. \"Value-Creating Pedagogy and Japanese Education in the Modern Era,\" ''The Journal of Oriental Studies, vol. 10 (2000) Special Issue'', p31</ref> The date was later adopted as the Founding Day of S\u014dka Gakkai. The four-volume work, published over a period of five years, sets forth his thoughts on education and proposals for systemic reform. Rather than education serving the state, as embodied in the [[Imperial Rescript on Education]], Makiguchi proposed a student-centered education with the purpose of ensuring the happiness of the learner.<ref>Kumagai, pp32-34</ref>\n\nHe also proposed the creation of an educational system comprising a partnership of school, home and community. In this system, a child would spend half a day in school and the other half in apprenticeships and other types of work activities at home and in the community befitting the nature and needs of the child. Makiguchi felt that implementing such a system would change bored, apathetic learners into eager, self-directed students.\n\n\"Makiguchi developed a theory of value that combined the idea of happiness as the goal of life with that of value as something that can be created. ... In value-creating pedagogy the main point of education is to aim for a happy life and develop the ability and attitude required to create value.\"<ref>Kumagai, p41</ref>\n\n== Conversion to Buddhism==\nIn June 1928, Makiguchi embraced [[Nichiren Buddhism]], having been introduced to Buddhism by his friend Sokei Mitani who was at time working as a [[Meijiro Kenshin Junior and Senior High School|Meijiro high school]] principal in [[Shinjuku, Tokyo]]. In Nichiren Buddhism, Makiguchi discovered a deep resonance with ideas he had been developing throughout his life.<ref>https://www.tmakiguchi.org/biography.html</ref>\n\nMakiguchi's practice of Buddhism took his life to an even deeper and broader dimension, resulting in the establishment of the ''\u201d S\u014dka Ky\u014diku Gakkai''\u201d (\u5275 \u4fa1 \u6559 \u80b2 \u5b66 \u4f1a;  English: Value-Creation Education Society), a society for educators and teachers, which later became the predecessor of today's [[Soka Gakkai]] organization. \n\nMakiguchi found support for his theory of value-creation and a world view consistent with his aims of educational reform and social betterment centered on addressing the subjective realities of the individual.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Miwa |first=Zeho |date=December 2002 |title=A consideration of how the works of Nichiren were received by readers: the case of Tsunesaburo Makiguchi |journal=Journal of Indian and Buddhist Studies |volume=51 |number=1 |pages=520\u2013524 |doi=10.4259/ibk.51.524 |access-date=12 September 2018|url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ibk1952/51/1/51_1_524/_pdf }}</ref> His close friend and disciple, [[Josei Toda]] followed his Buddhist conversion afterwards in 1930.

Already in his seventies, Makiguchi was subjected to harsh interrogation as the authorities sought to force him to recant his beliefs. Most of the other imprisoned members of Soka Kyoiku Gakkai caved to the extreme interrogation tactics, however Makiguchi never yielded, continuing to assert the value of [[freedom of religion]] as a fundamental [[human rights|human right]].

During morning and evening prayers, members take a moment to express gratitude to the first three presidents of Soka Gakkai: Tsunesabur\u014d Makiguchi (president from 1930-1944), J\u014dsei Toda (president from 1951\u20131958), and [[Daisaku Ikeda]] (president from 1960\u20131979, honorary president from 1979 to the present and president of SGI from 1975 to the present).\n\nA secular network of Soka schools around the world, including several independent secondary schools, and two universities ([[S\u014dka University]] of Japan and [[Soka University of America]]) were established by Daisaku Ikeda based on Makiguchi's pedagogy.\n\nMakiguchi's value-creating system of education has attracted the attention of educators around the world. His ''S\u014dka Ky\u014dikugaku Taikei'' has been translated into [[English language|English]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[French language|French]] and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]].

This is one of, if not the, first published example of modern environmentalist thinking.<ref name=Odata1994>{{cite journal |last=Odata |first=Toshihiro |date=1994 |title=\u7267\u53e3\u5e38\u4e09\u90ce \u300e\u4eba\u751f\u5730\u7406\u5b66\u300f \u306e\u5730\u7406\u5b66\u53f2\u4e0a\u306e\u518d\u8a55\u4fa1 |trans-title=A Reappraisal of Tsunesaburo Makiguchi's 'Jinsei Chirigaku' in the History of Geography in Japan |language=Japanese |url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/chirikagaku/49/4/49_KJ00003719645/_pdf/-char/en |format=pdf |journal=Chiri-Kagaku [Geographical Sciences] |volume=49 |issue=4 |pages=197\u2013212 |doi=10.20630/chirikagaku.49.4_197 |accessdate=21 August 2018 |layurl=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/chirikagaku/49/4/49_KJ00003719645/_article}}</ref>\n\nAlthough recognized as an able teacher, Makiguchi's uncompromising attitude toward authorities created problems. His clashes with officials of the Ministry of Education, school inspectors, ward assemblymen, city councilmen, and top officials of the city of Tokyo were frequent and resulted in frequent transfers between schools.<ref>Murata, Kiyoaki. ''Japan's New Buddhism: An Objective Account of Soka Gakkai.'' New York and Tokyo: Weatherhill, 1969. pp. 73-74</ref> After moving to Tokyo, he served as principal in a succession of six primary schools, from 1913 to 1932.\n\nDuring those years, he devoted much consideration to the relationship between life and education, developing his theories on ''s\u014dka'' or the creation of value, the happiness of the individual, the prosperity of society at large, and their interrelationships in practice.\n\n== Educational reformer ==\nHis aforementioned work ''Jinsei Chirigaku'' (''A Geography of Human Life''), predates the academic study of geography at the [[Imperial Universities]] of Kyoto and Tokyo in 1907 and 1911, respectively, and pioneered a new approach to teaching geography in Japan. Written between the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] and the [[Russo-Japanese War]], the work presents [[human geography]] as a subject for both [[formal learning|formal]] and [[nonformal learning]] to advance an understanding of cultural differences shaping and shaped by the relationship between human activity and its natural environment.<ref name=Odata1994>{{cite journal |last=Odata |first=Toshihiro |date=1994 |title=\u7267\u53e3\u5e38\u4e09\u90ce \u300e\u4eba\u751f\u5730\u7406\u5b66\u300f \u306e\u5730\u7406\u5b66\u53f2\u4e0a\u306e\u518d\u8a55\u4fa1 |trans-title=A Reappraisal of Tsunesaburo Makiguchi's 'Jinsei Chirigaku' in the History of Geography in Japan |language=Japanese |url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/chirikagaku/49/4/49_KJ00003719645/_pdf/-char/en |format=pdf |journal=Chiri-Kagaku [Geographical Sciences] |volume=49 |issue=4 |pages=197\u2013212 |doi=10.20630/chirikagaku.49.4_197 |accessdate=21 August 2018 |layurl=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/chirikagaku/49/4/49_KJ00003719645/_article}}</ref> While \"Japanese geographers of the time were chiefly concerned with describing the physical features of the earth,\"<ref>Murata, p72</ref> Makiguchi was arguably the first to discuss human geography as a system of knowledge correlating [[location theory]] and [[spatial distribution]] of human phenomena with economic, social and political geographies.<ref name=Takeuchi-Nozawa1988>{{cite journal |last1=Takeuchi |first1=Keiichi |last2=Nozawa |first2=Hideki |title= Recent Trends in Studies on the History of Geographical Thought in Japan\u2014Mainly on the History of Japanese Geographical Thought |url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/grj1984b/61/1/61_1_59/_pdf/-char/en |format=pdf |journal= Geographical Review of Japan |volume=61 (Ser.

A Geography of Human Life. Ed. by Dayle M. Bethel. Caddo Gap Press, 2002, p25</ref> In this work, Makiguchi also formulated the concept of humanitarian competition as an approach to international relations, writing that: \"The important thing is the setting of a goal of well being and protection of all people, including oneself but not at the increase of self-interest alone. In other words, the aim is the betterment of others and in doing so, one chooses ways that will yield personal benefit as well as benefits to others. It is a conscious effort to create a more harmonious community life.\"<ref>Makiguchi. A Geography of Human Life. p.286</ref> This publication is one of, if not the, earliest set of ideas in the global modern environmental movement.\n\nIn response to problems throughout the education system that resulted from the Meiji government's adoption of the [[Imperial Rescript]], Makiguchi published the first volume of ''S\u014dka Ky\u014dikugaku Taikei'' (''The System of Value-Creation Pedagogy'') together with his close friend and disciple [[J\u014dsei Toda]] on November 18, 1930.<ref>Kumagaki, Kazunori. \"Value-Creating Pedagogy and Japanese Education in the Modern Era,\" ''The Journal of Oriental Studies, vol. 10 (2000) Special Issue'', p31</ref> The date was later adopted as the Founding Day of S\u014dka Gakkai. The four-volume work, published over a period of five years, sets forth his thoughts on education and proposals for systemic reform. Rather than education serving the state, as embodied in the [[Imperial Rescript on Education]], Makiguchi proposed a student-centered education with the purpose of ensuring the happiness of the learner.<ref>Kumagai, pp32-34</ref>\n\nHe also proposed the creation of an educational system comprising a partnership of school, home and community. In this system, a child would spend half a day in school and the other half in apprenticeships and other types of work activities at home and in the community befitting the nature and needs of the child. Makiguchi felt that implementing such a system would change bored, apathetic learners into eager, self-directed students.\n\n\"Makiguchi developed a theory of value that combined the idea of happiness as the goal of life with that of value as something that can be created. ... In value-creating pedagogy the main point of education is to aim for a happy life and develop the ability and attitude required to create value.\"<ref>Kumagai, p41</ref>\n\n== Conversion to Buddhism==\nIn June 1928, Makiguchi embraced [[Nichiren Buddhism]], having been introduced to Buddhism by his friend Sokei Mitani who was at time working as a [[Meijiro Kenshin Junior and Senior High School|Meijiro high school]] principal in [[Shinjuku, Tokyo]]. In Nichiren Buddhism, Makiguchi discovered a deep resonance with ideas he had been developing throughout his life.<ref>https://www.tmakiguchi.org/biography.html</ref>\n\nMakiguchi's practice of Buddhism took his life to an even deeper and broader dimension, resulting in the establishment of the ''\u201d S\u014dka Ky\u014diku Gakkai''\u201d (\u5275 \u4fa1 \u6559 \u80b2 \u5b66 \u4f1a;  English: Value-Creation Education Society), a society for educators and teachers, which later became the predecessor of today's [[Soka Gakkai]] organization. \n\nMakiguchi found support for his theory of value-creation and a world view consistent with his aims of educational reform and social betterment centered on addressing the subjective realities of the individual.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Miwa |first=Zeho |date=December 2002 |title=A consideration of how the works of Nichiren were received by readers: the case of Tsunesaburo Makiguchi |journal=Journal of Indian and Buddhist Studies |volume=51 |number=1 |pages=520\u2013524 |doi=10.4259/ibk.51.524 |access-date=12 September 2018|url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ibk1952/51/1/51_1_524/_pdf }}</ref> His close friend and disciple, [[Josei Toda]] followed his Buddhist conversion afterwards in 1930.
