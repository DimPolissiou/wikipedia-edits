It is the fourth smartphone in the [[Google Nexus]] product family, unveiled on October 29, 2012, and released on November 13, 2012, and succeeded the [[Samsung Electronics|Samsung]]-manufactured [[Galaxy Nexus]]. As with other Nexus devices, the Nexus 4 was sold [[SIM lock|unlocked]] through [[Google Play]], but was also retailed by wireless carriers.\n\nBased upon the hardware of the [[LG Optimus G]], the Nexus 4 was distinguished from its predecessor by a quad-core [[List of Qualcomm Snapdragon systems-on-chip#Snapdragon_S4_Pro|Snapdragon S4 Pro]] processor, an 8 megapixel rear camera and 1.3 megapixel front camera which use the Sony BSI sensor, [[Qi (inductive power standard)|Qi]] [[wireless charging]], and the introduction of [[Android Jelly Bean|Android 4.2 Jelly Bean]], an update to the operating system which introduced 360-degree [[spherical photo]] [[Image stitching|stitching]] called \"Photo Sphere\", a quick settings menu, [[GUI widget|widgets]] on the lock screen, gesture typing, and an updated version of [[Google Now]].\n\nThe Nexus 4 was met with generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the quality and performance of the Nexus 4's hardware. It was also the first Google Nexus device to be released at a relatively lower outright price in comparison to other high-end/flagship smartphones, leading to unexpected high demand and supply shortages. However, the device was criticized for its lack of [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] support, and its lack of a user-removable battery which its predecessor, the Galaxy Nexus, included.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Unveiling ===\nGoogle was expected to launch the Nexus&nbsp;4 at a press event in [[New York City]]. However, the event was cancelled due to [[Hurricane Sandy]], and the Nexus&nbsp;4 (along with Android 4.2, the [[Nexus 10]] tablet, and the [[Nexus 7 (2012 version)|Nexus 7]] with cellular network support) was unveiled by Google via a press release on October 29, 2012, for a release on November 13, 2012.<ref name=\"NexusPressRelease\">{{cite news|last=Rubin|first=Andy|title=Nexus: The best of Google, now in three sizes|url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/10/nexus-best-of-google-now-in-three-sizes.html|accessdate=29 October 2012|date=29 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Stern|first=Joanna|title=Hurricane Sandy Prompts Google to Cancel Android Event|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/technology/2012/10/hurricane-sandy-prompts-google-to-cancel-android-event/|accessdate=28 October 2012|newspaper=ABC News|date=27 October 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"verge-unveiling\">{{cite web | url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/29/3569540/google-nexus-4-preview-price-release-date | title=The Nexus 4: Google's flagship phone lands November 13th for $299 | work=[[The Verge]] | date=October 19, 2012 | accessdate=January 26, 2013 | author=Topolsky, Joshua}}</ref>\n\n=== Release ===\nThe phone was made available for purchase on [[Google Play Store]] in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, France, Spain, and Australia.

The rear of the device contains a glass panel with an etched pattern of dots, producing a \"[[holography|holographic]]\" effect.\n\nInternally, the Nexus 4 shares much of its hardware with the LG Optimus G; it is powered by a 1.5&nbsp;GHz quad-core Snapdragon S4 Pro processor with 2&nbsp;[[Gibibyte|GB]] of RAM, providing either 8 or 16{{nbsp}}GB of internal storage; like the Galaxy Nexus, the Nexus 4 does not contain a [[Secure Digital|MicroSD]] slot. A 2100{{nbsp}}mAh battery offers about 15 hours of talk time and 390 hours of standby time; unlike its precursor, the Nexus 4's battery is not easily removable. The Nexus 4 also supports the [[Qi (standard)|Qi]] inductive charging standard. The Nexus 4 uses a {{convert|4.7|inch|mm|adj=on}}, [[720p]] [[IPS panel|IPS]] display, includes an 8-megapixel rear-facing camera and 1.3-megapixel front-camera which use the Sony BSI sensor.<ref name=\"TechSpecs\" /><ref name=\"verge-unveiling\" />\n\nThe Nexus 4, which takes a [[Subscriber_identity_module#3FF|micro SIM]] card, does not officially support [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]], and only officially supports up to [[HSPA+]] networks. Despite this, its radio hardware contains dormant LTE support, and a hidden [[Baseband processor|baseband]] setting could be used to enable LTE support.

Additionally, if the earlier phones are left on a smooth surface, an alarm with vibration will cause the phone to \"walk\" off the surface and fall.

It is the fourth smartphone in the [[Google Nexus]] product family, unveiled on October 29, 2012, and released on November 13, 2012, and succeeded the [[Samsung Electronics|Samsung]]-manufactured [[Galaxy Nexus]]. As with other Nexus devices, the Nexus 4 was sold [[SIM lock|unlocked]] through [[Google Play]], but was also retailed by wireless carriers.\n\nBased upon the hardware of the [[LG Optimus G]], the Nexus 4 was distinguished from its predecessor by a quad-core [[List of Qualcomm Snapdragon systems-on-chip#Snapdragon_S4_Pro|Snapdragon S4 Pro]] processor, an 8 megapixel rear camera and 1.3 megapixel front camera which use the Sony BSI sensor, [[Qi (inductive power standard)|Qi]] [[wireless charging]], and the introduction of [[Android Jelly Bean|Android 4.2 Jelly Bean]], an update to the operating system which introduced 360-degree [[spherical photo]] [[Image stitching|stitching]] called \"Photo Sphere\", a quick settings menu, [[GUI widget|widgets]] on the lock screen, gesture typing, and an updated version of [[Google Now]].\n\nThe Nexus 4 was met with generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the quality and performance of the Nexus 4's hardware. It was also the first Google Nexus device to be released at a relatively lower outright price in comparison to other high-end/flagship smartphones, leading to unexpected high demand and supply shortages. However, the device was criticized for its lack of [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] support, and its lack of a user-removable battery which its predecessor, the Galaxy Nexus, included.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Unveiling ===\nGoogle was expected to launch the Nexus&nbsp;4 at a press event in [[New York City]]. However, the event was cancelled due to [[Hurricane Sandy]], and the Nexus&nbsp;4 (along with Android 4.2, the [[Nexus 10]] tablet, and the [[Nexus 7 (2012 version)|Nexus 7]] with cellular network support) was unveiled by Google via a press release on October 29, 2012, for a release on November 13, 2012.<ref name=\"NexusPressRelease\">{{cite news|last=Rubin|first=Andy|title=Nexus: The best of Google, now in three sizes|url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/10/nexus-best-of-google-now-in-three-sizes.html|accessdate=29 October 2012|date=29 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Stern|first=Joanna|title=Hurricane Sandy Prompts Google to Cancel Android Event|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/technology/2012/10/hurricane-sandy-prompts-google-to-cancel-android-event/|accessdate=28 October 2012|newspaper=ABC News|date=27 October 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"verge-unveiling\">{{cite web | url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/29/3569540/google-nexus-4-preview-price-release-date | title=The Nexus 4: Google's flagship phone lands November 13th for $299 | work=[[The Verge]] | date=October 19, 2012 | accessdate=January 26, 2013 | author=Topolsky, Joshua}}</ref>\n\n=== Release ===\nThe phone was made available for purchase on [[Google Play Store]] in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, France, Spain, and Australia.

The rear of the device contains a glass panel with an etched pattern of dots, producing a \"[[holography|holographic]]\" effect.\n\nInternally, the Nexus 4 shares much of its hardware with the LG Optimus G; it is powered by a 1.5&nbsp;GHz quad-core Snapdragon S4 Pro processor with 2&nbsp;[[Gibibyte|GB]] of RAM, providing either 8 or 16{{nbsp}}GB of internal storage; like the Galaxy Nexus, the Nexus 4 does not contain a [[Secure Digital|MicroSD]] slot. A 2100{{nbsp}}mAh battery offers about 15 hours of talk time and 390 hours of standby time; unlike its precursor, the Nexus 4's battery is not easily removable. The Nexus 4 also supports the [[Qi (standard)|Qi]] inductive charging standard. The Nexus 4 uses a {{convert|4.7|inch|mm|adj=on}}, [[720p]] [[IPS panel|IPS]] display, includes an 8-megapixel rear-facing camera and 1.3-megapixel front-camera which use the Sony BSI sensor.<ref name=\"TechSpecs\" /><ref name=\"verge-unveiling\" />\n\nThe Nexus 4, which takes a [[Subscriber_identity_module#3FF|micro SIM]] card, does not officially support [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]], and only officially supports up to [[HSPA+]] networks. Despite this, its radio hardware contains dormant LTE support, and a hidden [[Baseband processor|baseband]] setting could be used to enable LTE support. However, this support was limited to LTE Band 4 only, and the device is not officially approved or marketed for LTE use. Google eventually disabled the ability to enable LTE support in a software update.<ref name=anand-n5launch>{{cite web|title=Google Announces The Nexus 5 and Android 4.4 Details|url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/7471/google-announces-the-nexus-5|work=Anandtech|accessdate=1 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"anand-n4lte\">{{cite web |title=Nexus 4 Includes Support for LTE on Band 4 (AWS) |url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/6474/nexus-4-includes-support-for-lte-on-band-4-aws |accessdate=2012-11-23}}</ref>\n\nDuring its lifetime, the Nexus 4 experienced a minor design tweak, receiving a couple of small nubs on the rear of the phone, where the glass back meets the frame, positioned just above the two screw holes; this was to improve sound volume when the phone was placed on a flat surface.

Additionally, if the earlier phones are left on a smooth surface, an alarm with vibration will cause the phone to \"walk\" off the surface and fall.

Isolated workers are unable to frequently exchange hydrocarbons with nest-mates, and their hydrocarbon profiles diverge from that of the colony. After 20-40 days in isolation, the hydrocarbon profiles of workers diverges to such an extent that they are no longer accepted by the colony<ref>{{cite journal |last3= Soroker|first3= Victoria|last1=Boulay |first1=Rapha\u00ebl |last4= Lenoir|first4 = Alain| last2 = Hefetza|first2= Abraham|title= Camponotus fellah colony integration: worker individuality necessitates frequent hydrocarbon exchanges |journal=Animal Behaviour |date=2000|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0003347200914088}}</ref>.

In ''C. fellah'', the colony trophallactic network has been quantified by combining unique marking of individuals with flourescently labelled food. This procedure refined our understanding of trophallaxis, revealing that transfer flow can switch direction during a trophallaxis event, that foragers receive (as well as unload) food, that foragers often leave the nest after offloading only a small amount of the food in their crop, and that non-foragers also offload considerable amounts of food. Further, the vast majority of trophallaxis events were short in duration, possibly functioning to maintain the colony odour rather than disseminate food <ref>{{cite journal |last1= Greenwald|first1= Efrat|last2= Segre|first2= Enrico|last3= Feinerman|first3= Ofer|title= Ant trophallactic networks: simultaneous measurement of interaction patterns and food dissemination\n|journal=  Scientific Reports|date= 2015|url= https://www.nature.com/articles/srep12496}}</ref>.\n\n== Social structure ==\nColony social networks comprise of three [[Community Structure Theory|communities]] - a nurse community of the queen and young workers who care for the brood, a forager community of older workers who leave the nest to forager, and a cleaner community of workers who specialise in nest maintenance. This structure is thought to emerge from age-induced changes in the behaviour of individual workers<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mersch |first1=Danielle P. |last2=Crespi |first2=Alessandro |last3=Keller |first3=Laurent |title=Tracking individuals shows spatial fidelity is a key regulator of ant social organization |journal=Science |date=2013|url=https://science.sciencemag.org/content/340/6136/1090?casa_token=gNznhsn2KBYAAAAA:xiHuFWCBo06_FxXEBBFyz72iVqNb6l1N440MLCxxn9quHot8Dsy2qdhPFxGgpyRH5wykEETyf288x9k}}</ref>\n\n== Effects of social isolation ==\nSocially isolated workers rapidly lose weight, and exhibit reduced lifespans and behavioural changes including increased locomotion <ref>{{cite journal |last2=Mersch |first2=Danielle P. |last1=Koto |first2=Akiko |last4=Keller |first4=Laurent|last3=Hollis |first3=Brian|title = Social isolation causes mortality by disrupting energy homeostasis in ants|journal= Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology |date= 2015 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00265-014-1869-6}}</ref> <ref>{{cite journal |last1= Boulay|first1= R.|last2= Quagebeur|first2=M.|last3= Godzinska|first3= E.J.|last4= Lenoir|first4= A.|title = Social isolation in ants: evidence of its impact on survivorship and behavior in Camponotus fellah (Hymenoptera: Formicidae)|journal= Sociobiology|date= 1999|url= https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Raphael_Boulay/publication/297394355_Social_isolation_in_ants_Evidence_of_its_impact_on_survivorship_and_behavior_in_Camponotus_fellah_Hymenoptera_Formicidae/links/579641f908ae33e89fad8048/Social-isolation-in-ants-Evidence-of-its-impact-on-survivorship-and-behavior-in-Camponotus-fellah-Hymenoptera-Formicidae.pdf}}</ref>. This effect is markedly reduced when workers are isolated with just one other individual. The increase in the mortality of isolated workers likely results from an increase in energy expenditure and a decrease in energy income. Through energy balance, social interactions therefore seem to influence health and ageing.\n\n== Endosymbionts ==\n''C.fellah'', like all tested [[Carpenter ant]] species harbours a primary endosymbiotic bacteria from the genus [[Blochmannia]]. This endosymbiont contributes to host nutrition, and when levels are experimentally reduced colony growth decreases.\n\n== References ==\n\n[[Category:Ants]]\n[[Category:Insects]]\n[[Category:Insects described in 1983]]\n", "text_old": "{{Taxobox\n|name = ''Camponotus fellah''\n|regnum = [[Animal]]ia\n|phylum = [[Arthropod]]a\n|classis = [[Insect]]a\n|ordo = [[Hymenoptera]]\n|familia = [[Formicidae]]\n|subfamilia = [[Formicinae]]\n|genus = ''[[Camponotus]]''\n|species = '''''C. fellah'''''\n|binomial = ''Camponotus fellah''\n|binomial_authority = (Dalla Torre, 1893)\n}}\n\n'''''Camponotus fellah''''' is a species of ant in the subfamily [[Formicinae]] found across the Middle East and North Africa.

In ''C. fellah'', the colony trophallactic network has been quantified by combining unique marking of individuals with flourescently labelled food. This procedure refined our understanding of trophallaxis, revealing that transfer flow can switch direction during a trophallaxis event, that foragers receive (as well as unload) food, that foragers often leave the nest after offloading only a small amount of the food in their crop, and that non-foragers also offload considerable amounts of food. Further, the vast majority of trophallaxis events were short in duration, possibly functioning to maintain the colony odour rather than disseminate food <ref>{{cite journal |last1= Greenwald|first1= Efrat|last2= Segre|first2= Enrico|last3= Feinerman|first3= Ofer|title= Ant trophallactic networks: simultaneous measurement of interaction patterns and food dissemination\n|journal=  Scientific Reports|date= 2015|url= https://www.nature.com/articles/srep12496}}</ref>.\n\n== Social structure ==\nColony social networks comprise of three [[Community Structure Theory|communities]] - a nurse community of the queen and young workers who care for the brood, a forager community of older workers who leave the nest to forager, and a cleaner community of workers who specialise in nest maintenance.

Recording sessions began in New York in October 1965 with numerous backing musicians, including members of Dylan's live backing band, [[Bob Dylan & The Band|the Hawks]]. Though sessions continued until January 1966, they yielded only one track that made it onto the final album\u2014\"[[One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)]]\". At producer [[Bob Johnston]]'s suggestion, Dylan, keyboardist [[Al Kooper]], and guitarist [[Robbie Robertson]] moved to the [[Columbia Records#The 1960s|CBS]] studios in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. These sessions, augmented by some of Nashville's top session musicians, were more fruitful, and in February and March all the remaining songs for the album were recorded.\n\n''Blonde on Blonde'' completed the trilogy of [[rock music|rock]] albums that Dylan recorded in 1965 and 1966, starting with ''[[Bringing It All Back Home]]'' and ''[[Highway 61 Revisited]]''. Critics often rank ''Blonde on Blonde'' as one of the greatest albums of all time. Combining the expertise of Nashville session musicians with a [[Modernism|modernist]] literary sensibility, the album's songs have been described as operating on a grand scale musically, while featuring lyrics one critic called \"a unique mixture of the visionary and the colloquial\".<ref name=\"Grayp5\"/> It was one of the first [[double album]]s in rock music.\n\nThe album peaked at number nine on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart in the US, where it eventually was certified double platinum, and it reached number three in the UK. ''Blonde on Blonde'' spawned two singles that were top-twenty hits in the US: \"[[Rainy Day Women \u266f12 & 35|Rainy Day Women #12 & 35]]\" and \"[[I Want You (Bob Dylan song)|I Want You]]\". Two additional songs\u2014\"[[Just Like a Woman]]\" and \"[[Visions of Johanna]]\"\u2014have been named as among Dylan's greatest compositions and were featured in [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]] list.\n\n==Recording sessions==\n\n===Background===\nAfter the release of ''[[Highway 61 Revisited]]'' in August 1965, Dylan set about hiring a touring band. Guitarist [[Mike Bloomfield]] and keyboard player [[Al Kooper]] had backed Dylan on the album and at [[Electric Dylan controversy|Dylan's controversial electric debut at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival]]. However, Bloomfield chose not to tour with Dylan, preferring to remain with the [[Paul Butterfield Blues Band]].<ref>{{harvnb|Gray|2006|p=62}}</ref> After backing him at concerts in late August and early September, Kooper informed Dylan he did not wish to continue touring with him.<ref name=Heylin235>{{harvnb|Heylin|2003|p=235}}</ref> Dylan's manager, [[Albert Grossman]], was in the process of setting up a grueling concert schedule that would keep Dylan on the road for the next nine months, touring the U.S., Australia, and Europe. Dylan contacted a group who were performing as Levon and the Hawks, consisting of [[Levon Helm]] from Arkansas and four Canadian musicians: [[Robbie Robertson]], [[Rick Danko]], [[Richard Manuel]] and [[Garth Hudson]]. They had come together as a band in Canada, backing American rocker [[Ronnie Hawkins]].<ref>{{harvnb|Gray|2006|p=33}}</ref> Two people had strongly recommended the Hawks to Dylan: Mary Martin, the executive secretary of Grossman, and blues singer [[John P. Hammond|John Hammond, Jr.]], son of record producer [[John Hammond (record producer)|John Hammond]], who had signed Dylan to Columbia Records in 1961; the Hawks had backed the younger Hammond on his 1965 album ''So Many Roads''.<ref>{{harvnb|Gray|2006|p=292}}</ref>\n\nDylan rehearsed with the Hawks in Toronto on September 15, where they were playing a hometown residency at Friar's Club,<ref name=Heylin235/> and on September 24, they made their debut in [[Austin, Texas]].<ref name = \"Heylin82\">{{harvnb|Heylin|1996|p=82}}</ref> Two weeks later, encouraged by the success of their Texas performance,<ref name = \"Heylin82\"/> Dylan took the Hawks into Studio A of Columbia Records in New York City.<ref name=\"Heylin83\">{{harvnb|Heylin|1996|pp=83\u201384}}</ref> Their immediate task was to record a hit single as the follow-up to \"[[Positively 4th Street]]\", but Dylan was already shaping his next album, the third one that year backed by rock musicians.<ref name=\"Heylin83\"/>\n\n===New York sessions===\nProducer [[Bob Johnston]], who had overseen the recording of ''Highway 61 Revisited'', started work with Dylan and the Hawks at Columbia Studio A, 799 Seventh Avenue, New York, on October 5. They concentrated on a new arrangement of \"[[Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?]]\", a song recorded during the ''Highway 61 Revisited'' sessions but not included on that album. Three further numbers were attempted, but none progressed into completed songs. Both the fragmentary \"Jet Pilot\" and \"I Wanna Be Your Lover\", a quasi-parody of [[the Beatles]]' \"[[I Wanna Be Your Man]]\", finally appeared on the 1985 box set retrospective, ''[[Biograph (album)|Biograph]]''. Also attempted were two takes of \"Medicine Sunday\", a song that later evolved into \"[[#Temporary Like Achilles|Temporary Like Achilles]]\".<ref>{{harvnb|Wilentz|2009|pp=109\u2013110}}</ref>\n\nOn November 30, the Hawks joined Dylan again at Studio A, but drummer [[Bobby Gregg]] replaced Levon Helm, who had tired of playing in a backing band and quit.<ref name=\"Wilentz110\">{{harvnb|Wilentz|2009|pp=110\u2013113}}</ref> They began work on a new composition, \"Freeze Out\", which was later retitled \"[[Visions of Johanna]]\", but Dylan wasn't satisfied with the results. One of the November 30 recordings was eventually released on ''[[The Bootleg Series Vol. 7: No Direction Home: The Soundtrack]]'' in 2005.<ref>{{harvnb|Gorodetsky|2005}}</ref> At this session, they completed \"Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?\" The song was released as a single in December, but only reached number 58 on the American charts.<ref name=\"Wilentz110\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Bj\u00f6rner 2011 (1)}}</ref>\n\nDylan spent most of December in California, performing a dozen concerts with his band, and then took a break through the third week in January following the birth of his son [[Jesse Dylan|Jesse]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bj\u00f6rner|2000}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Gray|2006|p=197}}</ref> On January 21, 1966, he returned to Columbia's Studio A to record another long composition, \"[[She's Your Lover Now]]\", accompanied by the Hawks (this time with Sandy Konikoff on drums).<ref name=heylin282-284>{{harvnb|Heylin|2009|pp=282\u2013284}}</ref> Despite nineteen takes, the session failed to yield any complete recordings. Dylan did not attempt the song again, but one of the outtakes from the January 21 session finally appeared 25 years later on ''[[The Bootleg Series Volumes 1\u20133 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961\u20131991]]''.<ref name=heylin282-284/><ref name=bauldie>{{harvnb|Bauldie|1991}}</ref> (Although the song breaks down at the start of the last verse, Columbia released it as the most complete take from the session.<ref name=heylin282-284/>)\n\nAround this time, Dylan became disillusioned about using the Hawks in the studio. He recorded more material at Studio A on January 25, backed by drummer Bobby Gregg, bassist Rick Danko (or [[Bill Lee (musician)|Bill Lee]]),<ref group=a>The booklet accompanying ''[[The Original Mono Recordings]]'' re-issue of ''Blonde on Blonde'' lists Will Lee as the bass player ({{harvnb|Marcus|2010|p=47}}). Wilentz insists that \"the playing and talk on the session tape show conclusively that [[Rick Danko]] was the bassist on 'One of Us Must Know'\" ({{harvnb|Wilentz|2009| p=113}}).</ref> guitarist Robbie Robertson, pianist [[Paul Griffin (musician)|Paul Griffin]], and organist Al Kooper.<ref name = \"Marcus47\"/> Two more new compositions were attempted: \"[[Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat]]\" and \"[[One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)]]\". Dylan was satisfied with \"One of Us Must Know\"; the January 25 take was released as a [[single (music)|single]] a few weeks later and was subsequently selected for the album.<ref name=\"Heylin285-286\">{{harvnb|Heylin|2009|pp=285\u2013286}}</ref>\n\nAnother session took place on January 27, this time with Robertson, Danko, Kooper and Gregg. Dylan and his band recorded \"Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat\" and \"One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)\" again, but Dylan was not satisfied with the recorded performance of either song.<ref>{{harvnb|Bj\u00f6rner 2011 (2)}}</ref> Also at this session Dylan attempted a rough performance of \"[[I'll Keep It with Mine]]\", a song which he had already recorded twice as a [[demo (music)|demo]]. The musicians added some tentative backing in a rendering biographer [[Clinton Heylin]] described as \"cursory\".<ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|2009|p=205}}</ref> The recording was ultimately released on ''The Bootleg Series Volumes 1\u20133'' in 1991.<ref name=bauldie/>\n\nA shortage of new material and the slow progress of the sessions contributed to Dylan's decision to cancel three additional recording dates. Six weeks later Dylan confided to critic [[Robert Shelton (critic)|Robert Shelton]], \"Oh, I was really down. I mean, in ten recording sessions, man, we didn't get one song&nbsp;... It was the band. But you see, I didn't know that. I didn't want to think that\".<ref>{{harvnb|Shelton|2011|p=248}}</ref>\n\n===Move to Nashville===\nRecognizing Dylan's dissatisfaction with the progress of the recordings, producer Bob Johnston suggested that they move the sessions to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]. Johnston lived there and had extensive experience working with Nashville session musicians. He recalled how Dylan's manager, Albert Grossman, was hostile to the idea: \"Grossman came up to me and said 'If you ever mention Nashville to Dylan again, you're gone.' I said, 'What do you mean?' He said, 'You heard me. We got a thing going here'\".<ref>{{harvnb|Sounes|2001|p=194}}</ref> Despite Grossman's opposition, Dylan agreed to Johnston's suggestion, and preparations were made to record the album at Columbia's A Studio on Nashville's [[Music Row]] in February 1966.<ref>{{harvnb|Sounes|2001|p=200}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to Kooper and Robertson, who accompanied Dylan from New York, Johnston recruited [[harmonica]] player, guitarist and bassist [[Charlie McCoy]], guitarist [[Wayne Moss]], guitarist and bassist [[Joe South]], and drummer [[Kenny Buttrey]]. At Dylan's request, Johnston removed the baffles\u2014partitions separating the musicians so that there was \"an ambience fit for an ensemble\".<ref name=\"Wilentz117\">{{harvnb|Wilentz|2009|p=117}}</ref> Buttrey credited the distinctive sound of the album to Johnston's re-arrangement of the studio, \"as if we were on a tight stage, as opposed to playing in a big hall where you're ninety miles apart\".<ref name=\"Wilentz117\"/> Dylan had a piano installed in his Nashville hotel room which Kooper would play to help Dylan write lyrics. Kooper would then teach the tunes to the musicians before Dylan arrived for the sessions.<ref name=Gill134>{{harvnb|Gill|2011|p=134}}</ref>\n\nOn the first Nashville session, on February 14, Dylan successfully recorded \"Visions of Johanna\", which he had attempted several times in New York. Also recorded was a take of \"[[4th Time Around]]\" which made it onto the album and a take of \"Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat\" which did not.<ref name=\"Wilentz118\"/>\n\nOn February 15 the session began at 6&nbsp;p.m. but Dylan simply sat in the studio working on his lyrics while the musicians played cards, napped and chatted. Finally, at 4&nbsp;a.m., Dylan called the musicians in and outlined the structure of the song.<ref name=\"Wilentz118\">{{harvnb|Wilentz|2009|pp=118\u2013119}}</ref> Dylan counted off and the musicians fell in, as he attempted his epic composition \"[[Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands]]\". Kenny Buttrey recalled, \"If you notice that record, that thing after like the second chorus starts building and building like crazy, and everybody's just peaking it up 'cause we thought, Man, this is it&nbsp;... This is gonna be the last chorus and we've gotta put everything into it we can. And he played another harmonica solo and went back down to another verse and the dynamics had to drop back down to a verse kind of feel&nbsp;... After about ten minutes of this thing we're cracking up at each other, at what we were doing. I mean, we peaked five minutes ago. Where do we go from here?\"<ref name=heylin>{{harvnb|Heylin|2003|p=241}}</ref> The finished song clocked in at 11 minutes, 23 seconds, and would occupy the entire fourth side of the album.<ref name=\"Wilentz118\"/>\n\nThe next session began similarly\u2014Dylan spent the afternoon writing lyrics, and the session continued into the early hours of February 17, when the musicians began to record \"[[Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again]]\". After several musical revisions and false starts, the fourteenth take was the version selected for the album.<ref name=\"Wilentz119-120\">{{harvnb|Wilentz|2009|pp=119\u2013120}}</ref>\n\n===Recording sessions in Nashville===\nMost accounts of recording ''Blonde on Blonde'', including those by Dylan scholars [[Clinton Heylin]] and [[Michael Gray (author)|Michael Gray]], agree that there were two blocks of recording sessions: February 14\u201317 and March 8\u201310, 1966.<ref name=\"encyclopedia59\">{{harvnb|Gray|2006|p=59}}</ref><ref name = \"Heylin90\">{{harvnb|Heylin|1996|pp=90\u201392}}</ref> This chronology is based on the logs and files kept by Columbia Records.<ref name=\"Wilentz119-120\"/><ref group=a>The booklet accompanying ''The Original Mono Recordings'' re-issue of ''Blonde on Blonde'' gives recording dates for each track of the double album, confirming the Nashville recording sessions were in two blocks ({{harvnb|Marcus|2010|pp=48\u201349}}).</ref>\n\nDylan and the Hawks performed concerts in Ottawa, Montreal, and Philadelphia in February and March,<ref name = \"Heylin90\"/> and then Dylan resumed recording in Nashville on March 8. On that date, Dylan and the musicians recorded the take of \"[[Absolutely Sweet Marie]]\" that Dylan selected for the album. Historian [[Sean Wilentz]] observed that \"with the sound of 'Sweet Marie', ''Blonde on Blonde'' entered fully and sublimely into what is now considered classic rock and roll\".<ref name=\"Wilentz122\">{{harvnb|Wilentz|2009|pp=122\u2013124}}</ref> The same day saw the successful takes of \"[[Just Like a Woman]]\", and \"[[Pledging My Time]]\", the latter \"driven by Robertson's screaming guitar\".<ref name=\"Wilentz122\"/>\n\nAccording to Wilentz the final recording session, on March 9\u201310, produced six songs in 13 hours of studio time.<ref name=\"Wilentz122\"/> The first number to be recorded to Dylan's satisfaction was \"[[Most Likely You Go Your Way and I'll Go Mine]]\", when McCoy reinforced on trumpet a musical phrase Dylan played on his harmonica, changing the sound of the song radically.<ref name=\"Wilentz122\"/> Dylan and his band then quickly recorded \"Temporary Like Achilles\". The session atmosphere began to \"get giddy\" around midnight when Dylan roughed out \"Rainy Day Women #12 & 35\" on the piano.<ref name=\"Wilentz122\"/> Johnston recalled commenting; \"That sounds like the damn [[Salvation Army]] band\". Dylan replied; \"Can you get one?\"<ref name = \"Black\"/> Johnston then telephoned trombonist Wayne Butler, the only additional musician required, and Dylan and the band, with McCoy again on trumpet, played a high-spirited version of the song.<ref name = \"Black\">{{harvnb|Black|2005}}</ref>\n\nIn quick succession Dylan and the musicians then recorded \"[[#Obviously 5 Believers|Obviously 5 Believers]]\" and a final take of \"Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat\" powered by Robertson's lead guitar.<ref name=\"Wilentz122\"/> The session concluded with \"[[I Want You (Bob Dylan song)|I Want You]]\" on which, as Wilentz notes, \"Wayne Moss's rapid-fire [[sixteenth note]]s on the guitar\" are an impressive element of the recording.<ref name=\"Wilentz122\"/>\n\n====Disagreement over Nashville recording dates====\nAl Kooper, who played keyboards on every track of ''Blonde on Blonde'', has contested the conventional account that there were two blocks of recording sessions in Nashville. In comments on Michael Gray's website, Kooper wrote: \"There was only ONE trip to Nashville for Robbie and I, and ALL THE TRACKS were cut in that one visit\", stating that Dylan merely broke for an outstanding concert. [[Charlie McCoy]] agreed with Kooper's version.<ref>{{harvnb|Kooper|2006}}</ref> Wilentz analyzed the recording of ''Blonde on Blonde'' in his book ''Bob Dylan In America'', concluding that the \"official\" documented version fits Dylan's known touring schedule, and notes that five of the eight songs first recorded after \"Stuck Inside of Mobile With The Memphis Blues Again\", but none of those recorded earlier, include a [[Middle eight|middle-eight]] section\u2014Dylan's first extensive foray as a writer into that conventional structure\".<ref name=\"Wilentz119-120\"/>\n\n===Mixing===\nDylan mixed the album in Los Angeles in early April, before he departed on the Australian leg of his [[Bob Dylan World Tour 1966|1966 world tour]].<ref name=\"Wilentz122\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|1996|p=94}}</ref> Wilentz writes that it was at this point it became \"obvious that the riches of the Nashville sessions could not fit onto a [[LP record|single LP]]\",<ref name=\"Wilentz122\"/> and they had \"produced enough solid material to demand an oddly configured [[double album]], the first of its kind in contemporary popular music\".<ref name=\"Wilentz119-120\"/> According to producer Steve Berkowitz, who supervised the reissue of Dylan's LPs in [[Monaural|mono]] as ''[[The Original Mono Recordings]]'' in 2010, Johnston told him that they carefully worked on the mono mix for about three or four days whereas the stereo mix was finished in about four hours.<ref group=a>Johnston said: \"We mixed that mono probably for three or four days, then I said, 'Oh shit, man, we gotta do stereo.' So me and a coupla guys put our hands on the board, we mixed that son of a bitch in about four hours!&nbsp;...

Ultimately, for Gill, the song seeks to convey how the artist is compelled to keep striving to pursue some elusive vision of perfection.<ref name=\"Gill97\"/> For Heylin, the triumph of the song is in \"the way Dylan manages to write about the most inchoate feelings in such a vivid, immediate way.\"<ref name = \"Heylin273\"/>\n\n;\"[[One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)]]\"\nWhen Dylan arrived at the studio on January 25, 1966, he had yet to work out the lyrics and title for what was to become the closing track on ''Blonde on Blonde''{{'}}s first side.<ref name=\"Heylin285-286\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|2003|p=741}}</ref><ref name=\"Wilentz113-114\">{{harvnb|Wilentz|2009|pp=113\u2013114}}</ref> With Dylan piecing together the song's sections, and the chorus that gives the song its title only emerging on take five, the session stretched through the night and into the next morning.<ref name=\"Wilentz113-114\"/> It was not until the fifteenth take that a full version was recorded.

Then the words meander through random combinations and disconnected fragments and images ('people just get uglier'; 'banjo eyes'; 'he was carrying a 22 but it was only a single shot'), before, in Dylan's own hand, amid many crossings-out, there appears 'Oh MAMA you're here IN MOBILE ALABAMA with the Memphis blues again'.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Wilentz|2007}}</ref>\n\nInside the studio, the song evolved through several musical revisions.

The [[double album]] [[gatefold]] sleeve opens to form a 12-by-26 inch photo of the artist, at three quarter length. The artist's name and the album's title only appear on the spine. A sticker was applied to the shrink wrap to promote the release's two hit singles, \"I Want You\" and \"Rainy Day Women #12 & 35\".<ref name=\"Trager51-52\" /><ref name=\"BillboardJuly16\" />\n\nThe cover shows Dylan in front of a brick building, wearing a suede jacket and a black and white checkered [[scarf]]. The jacket is the same one he wore on his next two albums, ''[[John Wesley Harding (album)|John Wesley Harding]]'' and ''[[Nashville Skyline]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Williams|1990|p=78}}</ref> The photographer, [[Jerry Schatzberg]], described how the photo was taken:\n{{blockquote|I wanted to find an interesting location outside of the studio. We went to the west side, where the Chelsea art galleries are now. At the time it was the [[Meatpacking District, Manhattan|meat packing district of New York]] and I liked the look of it. It was freezing and we were very cold. The frame he chose for the cover is blurred and out of focus. Of course everyone was trying to interpret the meaning, saying it must represent getting high on an [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] trip. It was none of the above; we were just cold and the two of us were shivering. There were other images that were sharp and in focus but, to his credit, Dylan liked that photograph.<ref name=\"schatzberg46\">{{harvnb|Schatzberg|2006|p=46}}</ref>}}\n\nResearch by rock historian Bob Egan suggests the location of the cover photo was at 375 West Street, at the extreme west of [[Greenwich Village]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.popspotsnyc.com/blonde_on_blonde/| title = Bob Dylan's Blonde on Blonde (1966)| author = Egan, Bob| accessdate = May 17, 2016| publisher = popspots.com| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160515010643/http://www.popspotsnyc.com/blonde_on_blonde/| archive-date = May 15, 2016| url-status = live}}</ref> The original inside gatefold featured nine black-and-white photos, all taken by Schatzberg and selected for the sleeve by Dylan himself.<ref name=\"schatzberg53\">{{harvnb|Schatzberg|2006|p=53}}</ref> A shot of actress [[Claudia Cardinale]] from Schatzberg's portfolio was included but later withdrawn because it had been used without her authorization and Cardinale's representatives threatened to sue,<ref name=\"schatzberg53\"/> making the original record sleeve a collector's item.<ref name=schatzberg>{{harvnb|Zoom sur le mythe Dylan|2006}}</ref> Dylan included a self-portrait by Schatzberg as a credit to the photographer.<ref name=\"schatzberg53\"/> The photos, for Gill, added up to \"a shadowy glimpse of [Dylan's] life, including an enigmatic posed shot of Dylan holding a small portrait of a woman in one hand and a pair of pliers in the other: they all contributed to the album's air of reclusive yet sybaritic genius.\"<ref name=\"Gill95\"/>\n\n==Release and reception==\n''Blonde on Blonde'' reached the Top 10 in both the US and UK album charts, and also spawned a number of hits that restored Dylan to the upper echelons of the singles charts. In August 1967, the album was certified as a gold disc.<ref>{{harvnb|Marqusee|2005|p=222}}</ref>\n\nA high-definition 5.1 [[surround sound]] edition of the album was released on SACD by Columbia in 2003.<ref>https://www.highfidelityreview.com/columbia-releases-15-bob-dylan-albums-on-hybrid-sacd.html</ref>\n\nThe album received generally favorable reviews. [[Pete Johnson (rock critic)|Pete Johnson]] in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote, \"Dylan is a superbly eloquent writer of pop and folk songs with an unmatched ability to press complex ideas and iconoclastic philosophy into brief poetic lines and startling images.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Johnson|1966}}</ref> The editor of ''[[Crawdaddy!]]'', [[Paul Williams (music journalist)|Paul Williams]], reviewed ''Blonde on Blonde'' in July 1966: \"It is a cache of emotion, a well handled package of excellent music and better poetry, blended and meshed and ready to become part of your reality. Here is a man who will speak to you, a 1960s bard with electric lyre and color slides, but a truthful man with x-ray eyes you can look through if you want. All you have to do is listen.\"<ref>Williams, Paul. \"Tom Paine Himself: Understanding Dylan\", ''Crawdaddy!'', July 1966, in {{harvnb|Williams|2000|p=33}}</ref>\n\nTo accompany the songbook of ''Blonde on Blonde'', [[Paul Nelson (critic)|Paul Nelson]] wrote an introduction stating, \"The very title suggests the singularity and the duality we expect from Dylan. For Dylan's music of illusion and delusion\u2014with the tramp as explorer and the clown as happy victim, where the greatest crimes are lifelessness and the inability to see oneself as a circus performer in the show of life\u2014has always carried within it its own inherent tensions&nbsp;...

It's that thin, that wild mercury sound. It's metallic and bright gold, with whatever that conjures up.\"<ref>Dylan Interview, ''Playboy'', March 1978, reprinted in {{harvnb|Cott|2006|p=204}}</ref> For critics, the double album was seen as the last installment in Dylan's trilogy of mid-1960s rock albums. As [[Janet Maslin]] wrote, \"The three albums of this period\u2014''[[Bringing It All Back Home]]'' and ''[[Highway 61 Revisited]]'' both released in 1965, and ''Blonde on Blonde'' from 1966\u2014used their electric instrumentation and rock arrangements to achieve a crashing exuberance Dylan hadn't approached before.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Miller|1981|p=225}}</ref> [[Mike Marqusee]] has described Dylan's output between late 1964 and the summer of 1966, when he recorded these three albums, as \"a body of work that remains unique in popular music.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Marqusee|2005|p=139}}</ref> For Patrick Humphries, \"Dylan's body of work during the 14-months period&nbsp;... stands unequalled in rock's 30-year history.

Where ''Highway 61 Revisited'' has Dylan exposing and confronting like a laser beam in surgery, descending from outside the sickness, ''Blonde on Blonde'' offers a persona awash inside the chaos&nbsp;... We're tossed from song to song&nbsp;... The feel and the music are on a grand scale, and the language and delivery are a unique mixture of the visionary and the colloquial.\"<ref name=\"Grayp5\">{{harvnb|Gray|2000|p=5}}</ref> Critic [[Tim Riley (music critic)|Tim Riley]] wrote: \"A sprawling abstraction of eccentric blues revisionism, ''Blonde on Blonde'' confirms Dylan's stature as the greatest American rock presence since [[Elvis Presley]].\"<ref>{{harvnb|Riley|1999|pp=128\u2013130}}</ref> Biographer Robert Shelton saw the album as \"a hallmark collection that completes his first major rock cycle, which began with ''[[Bringing It All Back Home]]''\". Summing up the album's achievement, Shelton wrote that ''Blonde on Blonde'' \"begins with a joke and ends with a hymn; in between wit alternates with a dominant theme of entrapment by circumstances, love, society, and unrealized hope&nbsp;... There's a remarkable marriage of funky, bluesy rock expressionism, and [[Arthur Rimbaud|Rimbaud]]-like visions of discontinuity, chaos, emptiness, loss, being 'stuck'.\"<ref name=\"Shelton224\"/>\n\nThat sense of crossing cultural boundaries was, for Al Kooper, at the heart of ''Blonde on Blonde'': \"[Bob Dylan] was the quintessential New York hipster\u2014what was ''he'' doing in Nashville? It didn't make any sense whatsoever. But you take those two elements, pour them into a [[test tube]], and it just exploded.\"<ref name=\"Gill95\"/> For Mike Marqusee, Dylan had succeeded in combining traditional blues material with [[modernism|modernist]] literary techniques: \"[Dylan] took inherited idioms and boosted them into a modernist stratosphere. 'Pledging My Time' and 'Obviously 5 Believers' adhered to blues patterns that were venerable when Dylan first encountered them in the mid-fifties (both begin with the ritual [[Delta blues|Delta]] invocation of \"early in the mornin\"). Yet like 'Visions of Johanna' or 'Memphis Blues Again', these songs are beyond category. They are allusive, repetitive, jaggedly abstract compositions that defy reduction.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Marqusee|2005|p=208}}</ref>\n\n''Blonde on Blonde'' has been consistently ranked high in critics' polls of the greatest albums of all time. According to [[Acclaimed Music]], it is the 10th most ranked album on all-time lists.<ref name=\"AM\"/> In 1974, the writers of ''[[NME]]'' voted ''Blonde on Blonde'' the number-two album of all

Recording sessions began in New York in October 1965 with numerous backing musicians, including members of Dylan's live backing band, [[Bob Dylan & The Band|the Hawks]]. Though sessions continued until January 1966, they yielded only one track that made it onto the final album\u2014\"[[One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)]]\". At producer [[Bob Johnston]]'s suggestion, Dylan, keyboardist [[Al Kooper]], and guitarist [[Robbie Robertson]] moved to the [[Columbia Records#The 1960s|CBS]] studios in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. These sessions, augmented by some of Nashville's top session musicians, were more fruitful, and in February and March all the remaining songs for the album were recorded.\n\n''Blonde on Blonde'' completed the trilogy of [[rock music|rock]] albums that Dylan recorded in 1965 and 1966, starting with ''[[Bringing It All Back Home]]'' and ''[[Highway 61 Revisited]]''. Critics often rank ''Blonde on Blonde'' as one of the greatest albums of all time. Combining the expertise of Nashville session musicians with a [[Modernism|modernist]] literary sensibility, the album's songs have been described as operating on a grand scale musically, while featuring lyrics one critic called \"a unique mixture of the visionary and the colloquial\".<ref name=\"Grayp5\"/> It was one of the first [[double album]]s in rock music.\n\nThe album peaked at number nine on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart in the US, where it eventually was certified double platinum, and it reached number three in the UK. ''Blonde on Blonde'' spawned two singles that were top-twenty hits in the US: \"[[Rainy Day Women \u266f12 & 35|Rainy Day Women #12 & 35]]\" and \"[[I Want You (Bob Dylan song)|I Want You]]\". Two additional songs\u2014\"[[Just Like a Woman]]\" and \"[[Visions of Johanna]]\"\u2014have been named as among Dylan's greatest compositions and were featured in [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]] list.\n\n==Recording sessions==\n\n===Background===\nAfter the release of ''[[Highway 61 Revisited]]'' in August 1965, Dylan set about hiring a touring band. Guitarist [[Mike Bloomfield]] and keyboard player [[Al Kooper]] had backed Dylan on the album and at [[Electric Dylan controversy|Dylan's controversial electric debut at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival]]. However, Bloomfield chose not to tour with Dylan, preferring to remain with the [[Paul Butterfield Blues Band]].<ref>{{harvnb|Gray|2006|p=62}}</ref> After backing him at concerts in late August and early September, Kooper informed Dylan he did not wish to continue touring with him.<ref name=Heylin235>{{harvnb|Heylin|2003|p=235}}</ref> Dylan's manager, [[Albert Grossman]], was in the process of setting up a grueling concert schedule that would keep Dylan on the road for the next nine months, touring the U.S., Australia, and Europe. Dylan contacted a group who were performing as Levon and the Hawks, consisting of [[Levon Helm]] from Arkansas and four Canadian musicians: [[Robbie Robertson]], [[Rick Danko]], [[Richard Manuel]] and [[Garth Hudson]]. They had come together as a band in Canada, backing American rocker [[Ronnie Hawkins]].<ref>{{harvnb|Gray|2006|p=33}}</ref> Two people had strongly recommended the Hawks to Dylan: Mary Martin, the executive secretary of Grossman, and blues singer [[John P. Hammond|John Hammond, Jr.]], son of record producer [[John Hammond (record producer)|John Hammond]], who had signed Dylan to Columbia Records in 1961; the Hawks had backed the younger Hammond on his 1965 album ''So Many Roads''.<ref>{{harvnb|Gray|2006|p=292}}</ref>\n\nDylan rehearsed with the Hawks in Toronto on September 15, where they were playing a hometown residency at Friar's Club,<ref name=Heylin235/> and on September 24, they made their debut in [[Austin, Texas]].<ref name = \"Heylin82\">{{harvnb|Heylin|1996|p=82}}</ref> Two weeks later, encouraged by the success of their Texas performance,<ref name = \"Heylin82\"/> Dylan took the Hawks into Studio A of Columbia Records in New York City.<ref name=\"Heylin83\">{{harvnb|Heylin|1996|pp=83\u201384}}</ref> Their immediate task was to record a hit single as the follow-up to \"[[Positively 4th Street]]\", but Dylan was already shaping his next album, the third one that year backed by rock musicians.<ref name=\"Heylin83\"/>\n\n===New York sessions===\nProducer [[Bob Johnston]], who had overseen the recording of ''Highway 61 Revisited'', started work with Dylan and the Hawks at Columbia Studio A, 799 Seventh Avenue, New York, on October 5. They concentrated on a new arrangement of \"[[Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?]]\", a song recorded during the ''Highway 61 Revisited'' sessions but not included on that album. Three further numbers were attempted, but none progressed into completed songs. Both the fragmentary \"Jet Pilot\" and \"I Wanna Be Your Lover\", a quasi-parody of [[the Beatles]]' \"[[I Wanna Be Your Man]]\", finally appeared on the 1985 box set retrospective, ''[[Biograph (album)|Biograph]]''. Also attempted were two takes of \"Medicine Sunday\", a song that later evolved into \"[[#Temporary Like Achilles|Temporary Like Achilles]]\".<ref>{{harvnb|Wilentz|2009|pp=109\u2013110}}</ref>\n\nOn November 30, the Hawks joined Dylan again at Studio A, but drummer [[Bobby Gregg]] replaced Levon Helm, who had tired of playing in a backing band and quit.<ref name=\"Wilentz110\">{{harvnb|Wilentz|2009|pp=110\u2013113}}</ref> They began work on a new composition, \"Freeze Out\", which was later retitled \"[[Visions of Johanna]]\", but Dylan wasn't satisfied with the results. One of the November 30 recordings was eventually released on ''[[The Bootleg Series Vol. 7: No Direction Home: The Soundtrack]]'' in 2005.<ref>{{harvnb|Gorodetsky|2005}}</ref> At this session, they completed \"Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?\" The song was released as a single in December, but only reached number 58 on the American charts.<ref name=\"Wilentz110\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Bj\u00f6rner 2011 (1)}}</ref>\n\nDylan spent most of December in California, performing a dozen concerts with his band, and then took a break through the third week in January following the birth of his son [[Jesse Dylan|Jesse]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bj\u00f6rner|2000}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Gray|2006|p=197}}</ref> On January 21, 1966, he returned to Columbia's Studio A to record another long composition, \"[[She's Your Lover Now]]\", accompanied by the Hawks (this time with Sandy Konikoff on drums).<ref name=heylin282-284>{{harvnb|Heylin|2009|pp=282\u2013284}}</ref> Despite nineteen takes, the session failed to yield any complete recordings. Dylan did not attempt the song again, but one of the outtakes from the January 21 session finally appeared 25 years later on ''[[The Bootleg Series Volumes 1\u20133 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961\u20131991]]''.<ref name=heylin282-284/><ref name=bauldie>{{harvnb|Bauldie|1991}}</ref> (Although the song breaks down at the start of the last verse, Columbia released it as the most complete take from the session.<ref name=heylin282-284/>)\n\nAround this time, Dylan became disillusioned about using the Hawks in the studio. He recorded more material at Studio A on January 25, backed by drummer Bobby Gregg, bassist Rick Danko (or [[Bill Lee (musician)|Bill Lee]]),<ref group=a>The booklet accompanying ''[[The Original Mono Recordings]]'' re-issue of ''Blonde on Blonde'' lists Will Lee as the bass player ({{harvnb|Marcus|2010|p=47}}). Wilentz insists that \"the playing and talk on the session tape show conclusively that [[Rick Danko]] was the bassist on 'One of Us Must Know'\" ({{harvnb|Wilentz|2009| p=113}}).</ref> guitarist Robbie Robertson, pianist [[Paul Griffin (musician)|Paul Griffin]], and organist Al Kooper.<ref name = \"Marcus47\"/> Two more new compositions were attempted: \"[[Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat]]\" and \"[[One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)]]\". Dylan was satisfied with \"One of Us Must Know\"; the January 25 take was released as a [[single (music)|single]] a few weeks later and was subsequently selected for the album.<ref name=\"Heylin285-286\">{{harvnb|Heylin|2009|pp=285\u2013286}}</ref>\n\nAnother session took place on January 27, this time with Robertson, Danko, Kooper and Gregg. Dylan and his band recorded \"Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat\" and \"One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)\" again, but Dylan was not satisfied with the recorded performance of either song.<ref>{{harvnb|Bj\u00f6rner 2011 (2)}}</ref> Also at this session Dylan attempted a rough performance of \"[[I'll Keep It with Mine]]\", a song which he had already recorded twice as a [[demo (music)|demo]]. The musicians added some tentative backing in a rendering biographer [[Clinton Heylin]] described as \"cursory\".<ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|2009|p=205}}</ref> The recording was ultimately released on ''The Bootleg Series Volumes 1\u20133'' in 1991.<ref name=bauldie/>\n\nA shortage of new material and the slow progress of the sessions contributed to Dylan's decision to cancel three additional recording dates. Six weeks later Dylan confided to critic [[Robert Shelton (critic)|Robert Shelton]], \"Oh, I was really down. I mean, in ten recording sessions, man, we didn't get one song&nbsp;... It was the band. But you see, I didn't know that. I didn't want to think that\".<ref>{{harvnb|Shelton|2011|p=248}}</ref>\n\n===Move to Nashville===\nRecognizing Dylan's dissatisfaction with the progress of the recordings, producer Bob Johnston suggested that they move the sessions to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]. Johnston lived there and had extensive experience working with Nashville session musicians. He recalled how Dylan's manager, Albert Grossman, was hostile to the idea: \"Grossman came up to me and said 'If you ever mention Nashville to Dylan again, you're gone.' I said, 'What do you mean?' He said, 'You heard me. We got a thing going here'\".<ref>{{harvnb|Sounes|2001|p=194}}</ref> Despite Grossman's opposition, Dylan agreed to Johnston's suggestion, and preparations were made to record the album at Columbia's A Studio on Nashville's [[Music Row]] in February 1966.<ref>{{harvnb|Sounes|2001|p=200}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to Kooper and Robertson, who accompanied Dylan from New York, Johnston recruited [[harmonica]] player, guitarist and bassist [[Charlie McCoy]], guitarist [[Wayne Moss]], guitarist and bassist [[Joe South]], and drummer [[Kenny Buttrey]]. At Dylan's request, Johnston removed the baffles\u2014partitions separating the musicians so that there was \"an ambience fit for an ensemble\".<ref name=\"Wilentz117\">{{harvnb|Wilentz|2009|p=117}}</ref> Buttrey credited the distinctive sound of the album to Johnston's re-arrangement of the studio, \"as if we were on a tight stage, as opposed to playing in a big hall where you're ninety miles apart\".<ref name=\"Wilentz117\"/> Dylan had a piano installed in his Nashville hotel room which Kooper would play to help Dylan write lyrics. Kooper would then teach the tunes to the musicians before Dylan arrived for the sessions.<ref name=Gill134>{{harvnb|Gill|2011|p=134}}</ref>\n\nOn the first Nashville session, on February 14, Dylan successfully recorded \"Visions of Johanna\", which he had attempted several times in New York. Also recorded was a take of \"[[4th Time Around]]\" which made it onto the album and a take of \"Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat\" which did not.<ref name=\"Wilentz118\"/>\n\nOn February 15 the session began at 6&nbsp;p.m. but Dylan simply sat in the studio working on his lyrics while the musicians played cards, napped and chatted. Finally, at 4&nbsp;a.m., Dylan called the musicians in and outlined the structure of the song.<ref name=\"Wilentz118\">{{harvnb|Wilentz|2009|pp=118\u2013119}}</ref> Dylan counted off and the musicians fell in, as he attempted his epic composition \"[[Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands]]\". Kenny Buttrey recalled, \"If you notice that record, that thing after like the second chorus starts building and building like crazy, and everybody's just peaking it up 'cause we thought, Man, this is it&nbsp;... This is gonna be the last chorus and we've gotta put everything into it we can. And he played another harmonica solo and went back down to another verse and the dynamics had to drop back down to a verse kind of feel&nbsp;... After about ten minutes of this thing we're cracking up at each other, at what we were doing. I mean, we peaked five minutes ago. Where do we go from here?\"<ref name=heylin>{{harvnb|Heylin|2003|p=241}}</ref> The finished song clocked in at 11 minutes, 23 seconds, and would occupy the entire fourth side of the album.<ref name=\"Wilentz118\"/>\n\nThe next session began similarly\u2014Dylan spent the afternoon writing lyrics, and the session continued into the early hours of February 17, when the musicians began to record \"[[Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again]]\". After several musical revisions and false starts, the fourteenth take was the version selected for the album.<ref name=\"Wilentz119-120\">{{harvnb|Wilentz|2009|pp=119\u2013120}}</ref>\n\n===Recording sessions in Nashville===\nMost accounts of recording ''Blonde on Blonde'', including those by Dylan scholars [[Clinton Heylin]] and [[Michael Gray (author)|Michael Gray]], agree that there were two blocks of recording sessions: February 14\u201317 and March 8\u201310, 1966.<ref name=\"encyclopedia59\">{{harvnb|Gray|2006|p=59}}</ref><ref name = \"Heylin90\">{{harvnb|Heylin|1996|pp=90\u201392}}</ref> This chronology is based on the logs and files kept by Columbia Records.<ref name=\"Wilentz119-120\"/><ref group=a>The booklet accompanying ''The Original Mono Recordings'' re-issue of ''Blonde on Blonde'' gives recording dates for each track of the double album, confirming the Nashville recording sessions were in two blocks ({{harvnb|Marcus|2010|pp=48\u201349}}).</ref>\n\nDylan and the Hawks performed concerts in Ottawa, Montreal, and Philadelphia in February and March,<ref name = \"Heylin90\"/> and then Dylan resumed recording in Nashville on March 8. On that date, Dylan and the musicians recorded the take of \"[[Absolutely Sweet Marie]]\" that Dylan selected for the album. Historian [[Sean Wilentz]] observed that \"with the sound of 'Sweet Marie', ''Blonde on Blonde'' entered fully and sublimely into what is now considered classic rock and roll\".<ref name=\"Wilentz122\">{{harvnb|Wilentz|2009|pp=122\u2013124}}</ref> The same day saw the successful takes of \"[[Just Like a Woman]]\", and \"[[Pledging My Time]]\", the latter \"driven by Robertson's screaming guitar\".<ref name=\"Wilentz122\"/>\n\nAccording to Wilentz the final recording session, on March 9\u201310, produced six songs in 13 hours of studio time.<ref name=\"Wilentz122\"/> The first number to be recorded to Dylan's satisfaction was \"[[Most Likely You Go Your Way and I'll Go Mine]]\", when McCoy reinforced on trumpet a musical phrase Dylan played on his harmonica, changing the sound of the song radically.<ref name=\"Wilentz122\"/> Dylan and his band then quickly recorded \"Temporary Like Achilles\". The session atmosphere began to \"get giddy\" around midnight when Dylan roughed out \"Rainy Day Women #12 & 35\" on the piano.<ref name=\"Wilentz122\"/> Johnston recalled commenting; \"That sounds like the damn [[Salvation Army]] band\". Dylan replied; \"Can you get one?\"<ref name = \"Black\"/> Johnston then telephoned trombonist Wayne Butler, the only additional musician required, and Dylan and the band, with McCoy again on trumpet, played a high-spirited version of the song.<ref name = \"Black\">{{harvnb|Black|2005}}</ref>\n\nIn quick succession Dylan and the musicians then recorded \"[[#Obviously 5 Believers|Obviously 5 Believers]]\" and a final take of \"Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat\" powered by Robertson's lead guitar.<ref name=\"Wilentz122\"/> The session concluded with \"[[I Want You (Bob Dylan song)|I Want You]]\" on which, as Wilentz notes, \"Wayne Moss's rapid-fire [[sixteenth note]]s on the guitar\" are an impressive element of the recording.<ref name=\"Wilentz122\"/>\n\n====Disagreement over Nashville recording dates====\nAl Kooper, who played keyboards on every track of ''Blonde on Blonde'', has contested the conventional account that there were two blocks of recording sessions in Nashville. In comments on Michael Gray's website, Kooper wrote: \"There was only ONE trip to Nashville for Robbie and I, and ALL THE TRACKS were cut in that one visit\", stating that Dylan merely broke for an outstanding concert. [[Charlie McCoy]] agreed with Kooper's version.<ref>{{harvnb|Kooper|2006}}</ref> Wilentz analyzed the recording of ''Blonde on Blonde'' in his book ''Bob Dylan In America'', concluding that the \"official\" documented version fits Dylan's known touring schedule, and notes that five of the eight songs first recorded after \"Stuck Inside of Mobile With The Memphis Blues Again\", but none of those recorded earlier, include a [[Middle eight|middle-eight]] section\u2014Dylan's first extensive foray as a writer into that conventional structure\".<ref name=\"Wilentz119-120\"/>\n\n===Mixing===\nDylan mixed the album in Los Angeles in early April, before he departed on the Australian leg of his [[Bob Dylan World Tour 1966|1966 world tour]].<ref name=\"Wilentz122\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|1996|p=94}}</ref> Wilentz writes that it was at this point it became \"obvious that the riches of the Nashville sessions could not fit onto a [[LP record|single LP]]\",<ref name=\"Wilentz122\"/> and they had \"produced enough solid material to demand an oddly configured [[double album]], the first of its kind in contemporary popular music\".<ref name=\"Wilentz119-120\"/> According to producer Steve Berkowitz, who supervised the reissue of Dylan's LPs in [[Monaural|mono]] as ''[[The Original Mono Recordings]]'' in 2010, Johnston told him that they carefully worked on the mono mix for about three or four days whereas the stereo mix was finished in about four hours.<ref group=a>Johnston said: \"We mixed that mono probably for three or four days, then I said, 'Oh shit, man, we gotta do stereo.' So me and a coupla guys put our hands on the board, we mixed that son of a bitch in about four hours!&nbsp;... So my point is, it took a long time to do the mono, and then it was, 'Oh, yeah, we gotta do stereo'\" ({{harvnb|Ford|2010|p=3}}).</ref>\n\n===Origin of album title===\nAl Kooper recalled that both the album title, ''Blonde on Blonde'', and song titles arrived during the mixing sessions. \"When they were mixing it, we were sitting around and Bob Johnston came in and said, 'What do you want to call this?' And [Bob] just like said them out one at a time&nbsp;...

Kooper recalled that he and Robertson had become adept at responding to Dylan's vocal and also singled out Joe South's contribution of \"this throbbing&nbsp;... rhythmically amazing bass part\".<ref name=\"Gill97\"/> Gill comments that the song begins by contrasting two lovers, the carnal Louise, and \"the more spiritual but unattainable\" Johanna. Ultimately, for Gill, the song seeks to convey how the artist is compelled to keep striving to pursue some elusive vision of perfection.<ref name=\"Gill97\"/> For Heylin, the triumph of the song is in \"the way Dylan manages to write about the most inchoate feelings in such a vivid, immediate way.\"<ref name = \"Heylin273\"/>\n\n;\"[[One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)]]\"\nWhen Dylan arrived at the studio on January 25, 1966, he had yet to work out the lyrics and title for what was to become the closing track on ''Blonde on Blonde''{{'}}s first side.<ref name=\"Heylin285-286\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|2003|p=741}}</ref><ref name=\"Wilentz113-114\">{{harvnb|Wilentz|2009|pp=113\u2013114}}</ref> With Dylan piecing together the song's sections, and the chorus that gives the song its title only emerging on take five, the session stretched through the night and into the next morning.<ref name=\"Wilentz113-114\"/> It was not until the fifteenth take that a full version was recorded.

Then the words meander through random combinations and disconnected fragments and images ('people just get uglier'; 'banjo eyes'; 'he was carrying a 22 but it was only a single shot'), before, in Dylan's own hand, amid many crossings-out, there appears 'Oh MAMA you're here IN MOBILE ALABAMA with the Memphis blues again'.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Wilentz|2007}}</ref>\n\nInside the studio, the song evolved through several musical revisions.

The [[double album]] [[gatefold]] sleeve opens to form a 12-by-26 inch photo of the artist, at three quarter length. The artist's name and the album's title only appear on the spine. A sticker was applied to the shrink wrap to promote the release's two hit singles, \"I Want You\" and \"Rainy Day Women #12 & 35\".<ref name=\"Trager51-52\" /><ref name=\"BillboardJuly16\" />\n\nThe cover shows Dylan in front of a brick building, wearing a suede jacket and a black and white checkered [[scarf]]. The jacket is the same one he wore on his next two albums, ''[[John Wesley Harding (album)|John Wesley Harding]]'' and ''[[Nashville Skyline]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Williams|1990|p=78}}</ref> The photographer, [[Jerry Schatzberg]], described how the photo was taken:\n{{blockquote|I wanted to find an interesting location outside of the studio. We went to the west side, where the Chelsea art galleries are now. At the time it was the [[Meatpacking District, Manhattan|meat packing district of New York]] and I liked the look of it. It was freezing and we were very cold. The frame he chose for the cover is blurred and out of focus. Of course everyone was trying to interpret the meaning, saying it must represent getting high on an [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] trip. It was none of the above; we were just cold and the two of us were shivering. There were other images that were sharp and in focus but, to his credit, Dylan liked that photograph.<ref name=\"schatzberg46\">{{harvnb|Schatzberg|2006|p=46}}</ref>}}\n\nResearch by rock historian Bob Egan suggests the location of the cover photo was at 375 West Street, at the extreme west of [[Greenwich Village]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.popspotsnyc.com/blonde_on_blonde/| title = Bob Dylan's Blonde on Blonde (1966)| author = Egan, Bob| accessdate = May 17, 2016| publisher = popspots.com| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160515010643/http://www.popspotsnyc.com/blonde_on_blonde/| archive-date = May 15, 2016| url-status = live}}</ref> The original inside gatefold featured nine black-and-white photos, all taken by Schatzberg and selected for the sleeve by Dylan himself.<ref name=\"schatzberg53\">{{harvnb|Schatzberg|2006|p=53}}</ref> A shot of actress [[Claudia Cardinale]] from Schatzberg's portfolio was included but later withdrawn because it had been used without her authorization and Cardinale's representatives threatened to sue,<ref name=\"schatzberg53\"/> making the original record sleeve a collector's item.<ref name=schatzberg>{{harvnb|Zoom sur le mythe Dylan|2006}}</ref> Dylan included a self-portrait by Schatzberg as a credit to the photographer.<ref name=\"schatzberg53\"/> The photos, for Gill, added up to \"a shadowy glimpse of [Dylan's] life, including an enigmatic posed shot of Dylan holding a small portrait of a woman in one hand and a pair of pliers in the other: they all contributed to the album's air of reclusive yet sybaritic genius.\"<ref name=\"Gill95\"/>\n\n==Release and reception==\n''Blonde on Blonde'' reached the Top 10 in both the US and UK album charts, and also spawned a number of hits that restored Dylan to the upper echelons of the singles charts. In August 1967, the album was certified as a gold disc.<ref>{{harvnb|Marqusee|2005|p=222}}</ref>\n\nA high-definition 5.1 [[surround sound]] edition of the album was released on SACD by Columbia in 2003.<ref>https://www.highfidelityreview.com/columbia-releases-15-bob-dylan-albums-on-hybrid-sacd.html</ref>\n\nThe album received generally favorable reviews. [[Pete Johnson (rock critic)|Pete Johnson]] in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote, \"Dylan is a superbly eloquent writer of pop and folk songs with an unmatched ability to press complex ideas and iconoclastic philosophy into brief poetic lines and startling images.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Johnson|1966}}</ref> The editor of ''[[Crawdaddy!]]'', [[Paul Williams (music journalist)|Paul Williams]], reviewed ''Blonde on Blonde'' in July 1966: \"It is a cache of emotion, a well handled package of excellent music and better poetry, blended and meshed and ready to become part of your reality. Here is a man who will speak to you, a 1960s bard with electric lyre and color slides, but a truthful man with x-ray eyes you can look through if you want. All you have to do is listen.\"<ref>Williams, Paul. \"Tom Paine Himself: Understanding Dylan\", ''Crawdaddy!'', July 1966, in {{harvnb|Williams|2000|p=33}}</ref>\n\nTo accompany the songbook of ''Blonde on Blonde'', [[Paul Nelson (critic)|Paul Nelson]] wrote an introduction stating, \"The very title suggests the singularity and the duality we expect from Dylan. For Dylan's music of illusion and delusion\u2014with the tramp as explorer and the clown as happy victim, where the greatest crimes are lifelessness and the inability to see oneself as a circus performer in the show of life\u2014has always carried within it its own inherent tensions&nbsp;...

It's that thin, that wild mercury sound. It's metallic and bright gold, with whatever that conjures up.\"<ref>Dylan Interview, ''Playboy'', March 1978, reprinted in {{harvnb|Cott|2006|p=204}}</ref> For critics, the double album was seen as the last installment in Dylan's trilogy of mid-1960s rock albums. As [[Janet Maslin]] wrote, \"The three albums of this period\u2014''[[Bringing It All Back Home]]'' and ''[[Highway 61 Revisited]]'' both released in 1965, and ''Blonde on Blonde'' from 1966\u2014used their electric instrumentation and rock arrangements to achieve a crashing exuberance Dylan hadn't approached before.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Miller|1981|p=225}}</ref> [[Mike Marqusee]] has described Dylan's output between late 1964 and the summer of 1966, when he recorded these three albums, as \"a body of work that remains unique in popular music.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Marqusee|2005|p=139}}</ref> For Patrick Humphries, \"Dylan's body of work during the 14-months period&nbsp;... stands unequalled in rock's 30-year history.

Where ''Highway 61 Revisited'' has Dylan exposing and confronting like a laser beam in surgery, descending from outside the sickness, ''Blonde on Blonde'' offers a persona awash inside the chaos&nbsp;... We're tossed from song to song&nbsp;... The feel and the music are on a grand scale, and the language and delivery are a unique mixture of the visionary and the colloquial.\"<ref name=\"Grayp5\">{{harvnb|Gray|2000|p=5}}</ref> Critic [[Tim Riley (music critic)|Tim Riley]] wrote: \"A sprawling abstraction of eccentric blues revisionism, ''Blonde on Blonde'' confirms Dylan's stature as the greatest American rock presence since [[Elvis Presley]].\"<ref>{{harvnb|Riley|1999|pp=128\u2013130}}</ref> Biographer Robert Shelton saw the album as \"a hallmark collection that completes his first major rock cycle, which began with ''[[Bringing It All Back Home]]''\". Summing up the album's achievement, Shelton wrote that ''Blonde on Blonde'' \"begins with a joke and ends with a hymn; in between wit alternates with a dominant theme of entrapment by circumstances, love, society, and unrealized hope&nbsp;... There's a remarkable marriage of funky, bluesy rock expressionism, and [[Arthur Rimbaud|Rimbaud]]-like visions of discontinuity, chaos, emptiness, loss, being 'stuck'.\"<ref name=\"Shelton224\"/>\n\nThat sense of crossing cultural boundaries was, for Al Kooper, at the heart of ''Blonde on Blonde'': \"[Bob Dylan] was the quintessential New York hipster\u2014what was ''he'' doing in Nashville? It didn't make any sense whatsoever. But you take those two elements, pour them into a [[test tube]], and it just exploded.\"<ref name=\"Gill95\"/> For Mike Marqusee, Dylan had succeeded in combining traditional blues material with [[modernism|modernist]] literary techniques: \"[Dylan] took inherited idioms and boosted them into a modernist stratosphere. 'Pledging My Time' and 'Obviously 5 Believers' adhered to blues patterns that were venerable when Dylan first encountered them in the mid-fifties (both begin with the ritual [[Delta blues|Delta]] invocation of \"early in the mornin\"). Yet like 'Visions of Johanna' or 'Memphis Blues Again', these songs are beyond category. They are allusive, repetitive, jaggedly abstract compositions that defy reduction.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Marqusee|2005|p=208}}</ref>\n\n''Blonde on Blonde'' has been consistently ranked high in critics' polls of the greatest albums of all time. According to [[Acclaimed Music]], it is the 10th most ranked album on all-time lists.<ref name=\"AM\"/> In 1974, the writers of ''[[NME]]'' voted ''Blonde on Blonde'' the number-two album of all
