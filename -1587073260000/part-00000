The program ran for exactly one year, the final show being the one-year anniversary.\n\n== Professional wrestling career ==\n\n=== World Wrestling Federation/WWF (1992\u20131999) ===\nIn 1992, Russo was hired as a freelance writer for ''[[WWE Magazine|WWF Magazine]]'' following a letter that he had written to [[Linda McMahon]], and would later become an editor<ref name=\"russoforgiven\"/> in 1994 under the pseudonym of Vic Venom. He was eventually promoted to the WWF Creative Team in 1996.<ref name=\"alumtrades\"/> In that same year, ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'' hit a [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] low of 1.8, as ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Monday Nitro]]'' (''Raw'''s chief competition), was in the midst of an 83-week winning-streak against ''Raw'' head-to-head (''see'' [[Monday Night Wars]]). With [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) eclipsing the WWF, McMahon called upon Russo to make changes to the televised product. Russo contributed edgy, controversial storylines involving sexual content, [[profanity]], [[List of professional wrestling terms#Swerve|swerves]] or unexpected [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turns]], and [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Work|worked]] [[Shoot (professional wrestling)|shoots]] in the storylines. Russo's style of writing came to be known as \"Crash TV\" and was inspired by [[The Jerry Springer Show]].\n\nIn early 1997, Russo became head writer for the WWF<ref name=\"aboutbiography\"/> and wrote their flagship show ''Raw Is War'' as well as their monthly [[pay-per-view]]s. With the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Angle|angles]] that he created, Russo had a large hand in putting WWF ahead of WCW in the Monday night rating wars during the [[Attitude Era]]. Some of the more controversial characters during this time, often cited by critics of Russo, include [[Sable (wrestler)|Sable]], [[Sean Morley|Val Venis]] and [[Charles Wright (wrestler)|The Godfather]]. Russo devised the infamous [[WWF Brawl for All|Brawl for All]] tournament.<ref>{{cite AV media|people=Oliver, Sean (director)|year=2016|title=Timeline: History of WCW \u2013 1998 \u2013 As told by Vince Russo|medium=DVD|publisher=Kayfabe Commentaries|quote=[John 'Bradshaw' Layfield] started carrying on that he could take anybody in the company, or in the locker room, in a real bar fight...

Russo and Ferrara attempted to make the same \"Crash TV\" style on ''Monday Nitro'' which was similar to ''Raw Is War'', only at an accelerated pace, including edgier storylines, more lengthy non-wrestling segments, constant heel/face turns, an increased amount of sexuality on the show, fake retirements, more backstage vignettes, expanded storyline depth, title changes, and the utilization of midcard talent in a more effective manner. Russo and Ferrara often focused on poking fun at the WWF.\n\nRusso's writing style created a large turnover in title changes, reflective of his \"crash TV\" writing philosophy. His booking of [[Jushin Thunder Liger]] losing and regaining the [[IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship]] on ''Nitro'' in late 1999 was not recognized by [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] (NJPW) in the title lineage until 2007;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.njpw.co.jp/prof/liger.html|trans-title=Jushia Thuander Liger|title=\u65b0\u65e5\u672c\u30d7\u30ed\u30ec\u30b9\u30aa\u30d5\u30a3\u30b7\u30e3\u30ebWEB\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8 -\u9078\u624b\u540d\u9451|language=Japanese|publisher=New Japan Pro-Wrestling|accessdate=2008-11-23|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231040026/http://www.njpw.co.jp/prof/liger.html|archivedate=December 31, 2006|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Liger lost the title to [[Juventud Guerrera]], a [[luchador]], after being hit over the head with a tequila bottle. Swerves and scenarios treated as \"[[Shoot (professional wrestling)|shoot]]s\" were heavily emphasized, as wrestlers supposedly gave unscripted interviews using \"insider\" terms that were only recognized by the Internet [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Smark|smarks]]; chaotic broadcasts became the norm.\n\n==== Firing and rehiring ====\nIn 2000, Russo received two phone calls, one from [[Bret Hart]] (then WCW World Heavyweight Champion) and another from [[Jeff Jarrett]] (then WCW United States Heavyweight Champion), both saying that they were injured, thus couldn't wrestle and forced to vacate their respective championships. This required Russo to alter the plans he had in mind for Hart and the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]]. Russo and his booking committee sat down to determine what would now happen at [[Souled Out (2000)|Souled Out]]. One of the ideas included putting the now vacated WCW Title on the shoot fighter [[Tank Abbott]], a former [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] fighter. In an attempt to do something believable, the idea was originally to have a \"rumble match\" in which [[Sid Eudy|Sid Vicious]] would be an early entrant in the match and would last all the way to the end when Abbott would come into the match and eliminate him with one punch. Russo claims that Abbott may not have held the belt for more than 24 hours if this title change had actually occurred. However, the day after he and his committee came up with the idea, he was asked to work in a committee and no longer be head writer. Russo declined the offer and left the company, with his immediate replacement being [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]], who along with other bookers, chose wrestler [[Chris Benoit]] to win the title from Vicious in a singles bout with [[Arn Anderson]] as the referee.\n\nThree months after Russo's departure, Kevin Sullivan was ultimately relieved of his duties and Russo was reinstated as booker, alongside the returning Eric Bischoff. The idea was that Russo and Bischoff would [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] WCW into a more modern, streamlined company that would allow the younger talent to work with the established stars. On the April 10, 2000 edition of WCW Monday Nitro, Vince Russo was introduced as an on-screen antagonist authority figure. Notable storyline points his character was involved with include \"[[The New Blood]] vs. [[The Millionaire's Club]]\"; his feud with [[Ric Flair]] where he and [[David Flair]] were involved with shaving Ric Flair's hair as well as [[Reid Flair]]'s hair; his feud with [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]]; and his short reign as world champion.  He also worked with [[Miss Elizabeth]].  On May 8, 2000, Russo booked [[Miss Elizabeth]] in her first official wrestling match against [[Daffney]].  [[Miss Elizabeth]] left the company shortly thereafter.\n\n==== Bash at the Beach 2000 incident====\nAt [[Bash at the Beach (2000)|Bash at the Beach]] 2000, Russo was involved in an incident with [[Hulk Hogan]] where Hogan was booked to lose a match against reigning world champion Jeff Jarrett. Hogan refused to lose the match (invoking his contract's \"creative control\" clause to override Russo), due to Russo's apparent lack of direction for Hogan's character following the planned loss. In the end, Russo booked Jarrett to literally lie down for Hogan which resulted in Hogan doing a worked shoot on Russo saying \"That's why this company is in the damn shape it's in; because of bullshit like this\" and scoring the pinfall victory by placing his foot on Jarrett's chest. Russo would come out later in the broadcast to nullify the result of the match, as he publicly fired Hogan. This action restored the title to Jarrett, which set up a new title match between Jarrett and [[Booker Huffman|Booker T]], with the latter winning the match and the title.\n\nAs Russo promised, Hogan never resurfaced in WCW and even filed a lawsuit against Russo for defamation of character (which was dismissed in 2003 stating that the charges filed against Russo were \"groundless\" and \"were just part of a wrestling storyline\").<ref name=\"wcwlawsuit\">{{cite web|url=http://google.com/search?q=cache:ghs2l_Htey8J:www.411mania.com/music/hall_of_fame/20299/Hulk-Hogan-Loses-2000-Defamation-Suit-Against-Russo.htm+%22Hulk+Hogan+Loses+2000+Defamation+Suit+Against+Russo%22&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=ca|title=Hulk Hogan Loses 2000 Defamation Suit Against Russo|accessdate=2010-01-18|date=August 11, 2003|publisher=411Wrestling.com}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Hogan claims (in his autobiography, ''Hollywood Hulk Hogan'') that Russo turned the angle into a shoot, and that he was double-crossed by Turner executive Brad Siegel who did not want to use him anymore due to his costs per appearance. Eric Bischoff states in his autobiography, ''[[Controversy Creates Cash|Controversy Creates Ca$h]]'', that Hogan winning and leaving with the title was a work which would result in his return several months later where the plan was to crown a new champion at [[Halloween Havoc (2000)|Halloween Havoc]], where Hogan would come out at the end of the show and ultimately win a champion vs. champion match \u2013 but Russo coming out to fire him was in fact a shoot which led to the lawsuit filed by Hogan.  Bischoff claims that he and Hogan celebrated after the event over the angle, but were distraught to get a phone call hearing of Russo's in-ring shoot after Hogan left the arena.\n\n====Angle with the Flairs, injury and departure====\nIn September 2000, Russo entered into an angle with [[Ric Flair]]. The angle notably included Russo sending cops to the ring to arrest Flair during the (kayfabe) wedding between [[Stacy Keibler]] and Flair's son [[David Flair|David]].\n\nIn October 2000, Russo's run as head writer and fledgling in-ring career came to a halt after a string of injuries primarily resulting from a match with Goldberg, where Russo was speared through a cage and had a head-on collision with the ringside barrier. Russo's contract was bought out by Time Warner shortly after the WCW buyout.\n\n=== Return to WWE (2002) ===\nRusso later returned to WWE in mid-2002, but quickly left after saying that there was \"no way in the world that this thing would work out\".<ref name=\"wwe2002\">{{cite web|url=http://www.411mania.com/politics/columns/16358/Vince-Russo-Speaks-On-WWE,-McMahon,-NWA:-TNA,-More.htm|title=Vince Russo Speaks on WWE, McMahon, NWA TNA, More \u2013 Get in the Ring Interview|accessdate=2010-01-05|publisher=411Wrestling.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607141707/http://www.411mania.com/politics/columns/16358/Vince-Russo-Speaks-On-WWE,-McMahon,-NWA:-TNA,-More.htm|archive-date=June 7, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The major storyline idea he proposed was an entire restart of the [[The Invasion (professional wrestling)|WCW Invasion]], featuring previously unsigned talent such as [[Bill Goldberg]], [[Scott Steiner]], [[Eric Bischoff]] and [[Bret Hart]],<ref>{{cite book|author=Scott Keith|title=Wrestling's One Ring Circus: The Death of the World Wrestling Federation|year=2004|publisher=Citadel Press|isbn=0-8065-2619-X }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/appendix/Russo/711RussoCover.shtml|title=Russo brought back to WWE, role undefined|accessdate=2007-06-06|date=June 29, 2002|publisher=Pro Wrestling Torch}}</ref> Feeling disrespected by a phone call with Stephanie McMahon, Russo then left of his own accord (turning down a $125,000 per year stay-at-home 'advisory' role with WWE in favor of a $100,000 per year full-time position with TNA).<ref>{{cite book|author=Jerry W.

The program ran for exactly one year, the final show being the one-year anniversary.\n\n== Professional wrestling career ==\n\n=== World Wrestling Federation/WWF (1992\u20131999) ===\nIn 1992, Russo was hired as a freelance writer for ''[[WWE Magazine|WWF Magazine]]'' following a letter that he had written to [[Linda McMahon]], and would later become an editor<ref name=\"russoforgiven\"/> in 1994 under the pseudonym of Vic Venom. He was eventually promoted to the WWF Creative Team in 1996.<ref name=\"alumtrades\"/> In that same year, ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'' hit a [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] low of 1.8, as ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Monday Nitro]]'' (''Raw'''s chief competition), was in the midst of an 83-week winning-streak against ''Raw'' head-to-head (''see'' [[Monday Night Wars]]). With [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) eclipsing the WWF, McMahon called upon Russo to make changes to the televised product. Russo contributed edgy, controversial storylines involving sexual content, [[profanity]], [[List of professional wrestling terms#Swerve|swerves]] or unexpected [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turns]], and [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Work|worked]] [[Shoot (professional wrestling)|shoots]] in the storylines. Russo's style of writing came to be known as \"Crash TV\" and was inspired by [[The Jerry Springer Show]].\n\nIn early 1997, Russo became head writer for the WWF<ref name=\"aboutbiography\"/> and wrote their flagship show ''Raw Is War'' as well as their monthly [[pay-per-view]]s. With the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Angle|angles]] that he created, Russo had a large hand in putting WWF ahead of WCW in the Monday night rating wars during the [[Attitude Era]]. Some of the more controversial characters during this time, often cited by critics of Russo, include [[Sable (wrestler)|Sable]], [[Sean Morley|Val Venis]] and [[Charles Wright (wrestler)|The Godfather]]. Russo devised the infamous [[WWF Brawl for All|Brawl for All]] tournament.<ref>{{cite AV media|people=Oliver, Sean (director)|year=2016|title=Timeline: History of WCW \u2013 1998 \u2013 As told by Vince Russo|medium=DVD|publisher=Kayfabe Commentaries|quote=[John 'Bradshaw' Layfield] started carrying on that he could take anybody in the company, or in the locker room, in a real bar fight...

Russo and Ferrara attempted to make the same \"Crash TV\" style on ''Monday Nitro'' which was similar to ''Raw Is War'', only at an accelerated pace, including edgier storylines, more lengthy non-wrestling segments, constant heel/face turns, an increased amount of sexuality on the show, fake retirements, more backstage vignettes, expanded storyline depth, title changes, and the utilization of midcard talent in a more effective manner. Russo and Ferrara often focused on poking fun at the WWF.\n\nRusso's writing style created a large turnover in title changes, reflective of his \"crash TV\" writing philosophy. His booking of [[Jushin Thunder Liger]] losing and regaining the [[IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship]] on ''Nitro'' in late 1999 was not recognized by [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] (NJPW) in the title lineage until 2007;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.njpw.co.jp/prof/liger.html|trans-title=Jushia Thuander Liger|title=\u65b0\u65e5\u672c\u30d7\u30ed\u30ec\u30b9\u30aa\u30d5\u30a3\u30b7\u30e3\u30ebWEB\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8 -\u9078\u624b\u540d\u9451|language=Japanese|publisher=New Japan Pro-Wrestling|accessdate=2008-11-23|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231040026/http://www.njpw.co.jp/prof/liger.html|archivedate=December 31, 2006|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Liger lost the title to [[Juventud Guerrera]], a [[luchador]], after being hit over the head with a tequila bottle. Swerves and scenarios treated as \"[[Shoot (professional wrestling)|shoot]]s\" were heavily emphasized, as wrestlers supposedly gave unscripted interviews using \"insider\" terms that were only recognized by the Internet [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Smark|smarks]]; chaotic broadcasts became the norm.\n\n==== Firing and rehiring ====\nIn 2000, Russo received two phone calls, one from [[Bret Hart]] (then WCW World Heavyweight Champion) and another from [[Jeff Jarrett]] (then WCW United States Heavyweight Champion), both saying that they were injured, thus couldn't wrestle and forced to vacate their respective championships. This required Russo to alter the plans he had in mind for Hart and the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]]. Russo and his booking committee sat down to determine what would now happen at [[Souled Out (2000)|Souled Out]]. One of the ideas included putting the now vacated WCW Title on the shoot fighter [[Tank Abbott]], a former [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] fighter. In an attempt to do something believable, the idea was originally to have a \"rumble match\" in which [[Sid Eudy|Sid Vicious]] would be an early entrant in the match and would last all the way to the end when Abbott would come into the match and eliminate him with one punch. Russo claims that Abbott may not have held the belt for more than 24 hours if this title change had actually occurred. However, the day after he and his committee came up with the idea, he was asked to work in a committee and no longer be head writer. Russo declined the offer and left the company, with his immediate replacement being [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]], who along with other bookers, chose wrestler [[Chris Benoit]] to win the title from Vicious in a singles bout with [[Arn Anderson]] as the referee.\n\nThree months after Russo's departure, Kevin Sullivan was ultimately relieved of his duties and Russo was reinstated as booker, alongside the returning Eric Bischoff. The idea was that Russo and Bischoff would [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] WCW into a more modern, streamlined company that would allow the younger talent to work with the established stars. On the April 10, 2000 edition of WCW Monday Nitro, Vince Russo was introduced as an on-screen antagonist authority figure. Notable storyline points his character was involved with include \"[[The New Blood]] vs. [[The Millionaire's Club]]\"; his feud with [[Ric Flair]] where he and [[David Flair]] were involved with shaving Ric Flair's hair as well as [[Reid Flair]]'s hair; his feud with [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]]; and his short reign as world champion.  He also worked with [[Miss Elizabeth]].  On May 8, 2000, Russo booked [[Miss Elizabeth]] in her first official wrestling match against [[Daffney]].  [[Miss Elizabeth]] left the company shortly thereafter.\n\n==== Bash at the Beach 2000 incident====\nAt [[Bash at the Beach (2000)|Bash at the Beach]] 2000, Russo was involved in an incident with [[Hulk Hogan]] where Hogan was booked to lose a match against reigning world champion Jeff Jarrett. Hogan refused to lose the match (invoking his contract's \"creative control\" clause to override Russo), due to Russo's apparent lack of direction for Hogan's character following the planned loss. In the end, Russo booked Jarrett to literally lie down for Hogan which resulted in Hogan doing a worked shoot on Russo saying \"That's why this company is in the damn shape it's in; because of bullshit like this\" and scoring the pinfall victory by placing his foot on Jarrett's chest. Russo would come out later in the broadcast to nullify the result of the match, as he publicly fired Hogan. This action restored the title to Jarrett, which set up a new title match between Jarrett and [[Booker Huffman|Booker T]], with the latter winning the match and the title.\n\nAs Russo promised, Hogan never resurfaced in WCW and even filed a lawsuit against Russo for defamation of character (which was dismissed in 2003 stating that the charges filed against Russo were \"groundless\" and \"were just part of a wrestling storyline\").<ref name=\"wcwlawsuit\">{{cite web|url=http://google.com/search?q=cache:ghs2l_Htey8J:www.411mania.com/music/hall_of_fame/20299/Hulk-Hogan-Loses-2000-Defamation-Suit-Against-Russo.htm+%22Hulk+Hogan+Loses+2000+Defamation+Suit+Against+Russo%22&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=ca|title=Hulk Hogan Loses 2000 Defamation Suit Against Russo|accessdate=2010-01-18|date=August 11, 2003|publisher=411Wrestling.com}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Hogan claims (in his autobiography, ''Hollywood Hulk Hogan'') that Russo turned the angle into a shoot, and that he was double-crossed by Turner executive Brad Siegel who did not want to use him anymore due to his costs per appearance. Eric Bischoff states in his autobiography, ''[[Controversy Creates Cash|Controversy Creates Ca$h]]'', that Hogan winning and leaving with the title was a work which would result in his return several months later where the plan was to crown a new champion at [[Halloween Havoc (2000)|Halloween Havoc]], where Hogan would come out at the end of the show and ultimately win a champion vs. champion match \u2013 but Russo coming out to fire him was in fact a shoot which led to the lawsuit filed by Hogan.  Bischoff claims that he and Hogan celebrated after the event over the angle, but were distraught to get a phone call hearing of Russo's in-ring shoot after Hogan left the arena.\n\n====Angle with the Flairs, injury and departure====\nIn September 2000, Russo entered into an angle with [[Ric Flair]]. The angle notably included Russo sending cops to the ring to arrest Flair during the (kayfabe) wedding between [[Stacy Keibler]] and Flair's son [[David Flair|David]].\n\nIn October 2000, Russo's run as head writer and fledgling in-ring career came to a halt after a string of injuries primarily resulting from a match with Goldberg, where Russo was speared through a cage and had a head-on collision with the ringside barrier. Russo's contract was bought out by Time Warner shortly after the WCW buyout.\n\n=== Return to WWE (2002) ===\nRusso later returned to WWE in mid-2002, but quickly left after saying that there was \"no way in the world that this thing would work out\".<ref name=\"wwe2002\">{{cite web|url=http://www.411mania.com/politics/columns/16358/Vince-Russo-Speaks-On-WWE,-McMahon,-NWA:-TNA,-More.htm|title=Vince Russo Speaks on WWE, McMahon, NWA TNA, More \u2013 Get in the Ring Interview|accessdate=2010-01-05|publisher=411Wrestling.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607141707/http://www.411mania.com/politics/columns/16358/Vince-Russo-Speaks-On-WWE,-McMahon,-NWA:-TNA,-More.htm|archive-date=June 7, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The major storyline idea he proposed was an entire restart of the [[The Invasion (professional wrestling)|WCW Invasion]], featuring previously unsigned talent such as [[Bill Goldberg]], [[Scott Steiner]], [[Eric Bischoff]] and [[Bret Hart]],<ref>{{cite book|author=Scott Keith|title=Wrestling's One Ring Circus: The Death of the World Wrestling Federation|year=2004|publisher=Citadel Press|isbn=0-8065-2619-X }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/appendix/Russo/711RussoCover.shtml|title=Russo brought back to WWE, role undefined|accessdate=2007-06-06|date=June 29, 2002|publisher=Pro Wrestling Torch}}</ref> Feeling disrespected by a phone call with Stephanie McMahon, Russo then left of his own accord (turning down a $125,000 per year stay-at-home 'advisory' role with WWE in favor of a $100,000 per year full-time position with TNA).<ref>{{cite book|author=Jerry W.

I hate to admit it but McEwen and Prudhomme showed us the way to the future.

Jamie and Joe are deceased. \n\n==Early career==\nMcEwen gained his early experience in a variety of cars, beginning in 1953 with a '53 [[Oldsmobile#1950s|Oldsmobile]] at [[Santa Ana Drags]] in [[Irvine, California|Irvine]]. He then went on to race a '54 Olds at [[Lions Drag Strip]] in [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]].\n\nHe went from the [[Stock (drag racing class)|stock]] ranks to [[gasser (car)|gas]] coupes, [[Altered (drag racing)|Altered]]s, and eventually [[Slingshot dragster|dragster]]s and [[Funny Car|funny car]]s. Among the cars he drove were the Stone-Woods-Cook '50 Olds fastback, the Bader and Ferrara [[Cadillac]]-powered ''Crosseyed Crosley'', [[Art Chrisman]]'s ''[[Hustler II]]'', the [[Bud Rasner]] and [[Gary Slusser]] Fiat coupe, [[Dick Rea]]'s Chrysler-powered supercharged<!--not hyphenated...--> gas dragster, and [[Gene Adams]]' Albertson Olds.\n\n==1960s==\nMcEwen continued his relationship with Adams for several years. In 1962, he drove Adams' ''Shark'', which was one of the first dragsters to use a streamlined body with an enclosed parachute pack. This would turn out to be one of McEwen's best known rides.<!--not all were \"dragsters\"...-->\n\nIn 1963, McEwen achieved his first major success when he a runner-up<!--it's not a \"second place\" so much when you get to a final against just one other driver--> finish against [[Art Malone]] at the [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]] March Meet in California in the Broussard-Garrison-Purcell-Davis car.

There, Prudhomme in the ''B&M Torkmaster Special'' took the win, with a 7.59 [[Drag racing#Glossary|e.t.]] to McEwen's 7.69. They would not meet again for the rest of the decade.\n\nMcEwen won the 1966 ''[[Hot Rod (magazine)|Hot Rod]]'' Magazine Championships at [[Riverside Raceway]] and then went on to win the 1968 Stardust National Open in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]. He also recorded the lowest ever elapsed time to date with a blistering 6.64 at the [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] PDA Meet in 1968.\n\n===The promoter===\nMcEwen also continued to build on his reputation as a colorful promoter. The Plymouth [[Plymouth Barracuda|Hemi Cuda]]<ref name=\"srot\"/> he unveiled in 1965 was featured in every major car magazine. He convinced the Southern California Plymouth Dealers Association to support him and displayed the car all over the West Coast.\n\nIn 1967, McEwen took the same approach with one of drag racing's great one-shot wonders, Ford's [[Super Mustang]]. The car stole the show when it made its debut at the Winternationals.\n\n====Wildlife Racing====\nMcEwen's strong promotional talent and Prudhomme's success on the strip eventually led the two to form a national touring team, sponsored by the toy company [[Mattel]], and in mid-1969, McEwen and Prudhomme became co-owners of \"Wildlife Racing.\"<ref name=sitfoe>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UNMVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5xEEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3399%2C101709 |newspaper=Milwaukee Sentinel |last=Bochat |first=Rel |title=Son's illness tough foe for dragster |date=July 1, 1977 |page=1, part 2}}</ref> The Mattel [[Hot Wheels]] sponsorship deal ran from 1970 through 1972. Wildlife Racing then signed with Care Free Sugarless Gum as a sponsor in 1973. McEwen and Prudhomme dissolved their partnership at the end of the 1973 season.\n\n==1970s==\nIn 1972, McEwen won his first major event when he dominated the Top Fuel field at the Bakersfield March Meet. A year later, he scored his first NHRA national event victory by topping the quickest<!--quickest & fastest are not the same thing in drag racing--> Funny Car field in history at the SuperNationals at [[Ontario Motor Speedway]].\n\nHe went on to win four more national events, including his dramatic [[NHRA U.S. Nationals|U.S. Nationals]] Funny Car victory over Prudhomme in 1978. The win came only a few days after the death of his son Jamie, who had battled [[leukemia]].<ref name=sitfoe/>\n\n==Later life==\nMcEwen won the [[American Hot Rod Association|AHRA]] World Finals at [[Spokane Raceway Park]] in 1982,<ref name=nohrsard>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zlxOAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ePkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6586%2C2104761 |newspaper=Spokane Chronicle |location=Washington |last=Gerheim |first=Earl |title=McEwen didn't horse around|date=August 23, 1982 |page=18 }}</ref> the prestigious Big Bud Shootout in 1984, and Top Fuel at the 1991 [[NHRA Summernationals|Summernationals]] at [[Old Bridge Township Raceway Park|Englishtown]], [[New Jersey]].<ref name=msurprs>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gQoxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=8eEFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1110%2C2656375 |newspaper=Reading Eagle |location=Pennsylvania |title='Mongoose' surprise winner |last=Bickhart |first=Terry |date=July 8, 1991 |page=16 }}</ref> \n\nMcEwen solved his Corvette funny car's stability problems by adding tip fences to the rear spoiler.<ref>McClurg, p.50 caption.</ref>\n\nHis \u201cgorgeous\u201d<!--is a quote, not a WP opinion--> 1957 Chevy replica was built as a tribute to the iconic Chevrolet.

He produced a sponsorship package that allowed him and Prudhomme to buy the best equipment, pay expenses, make money and sell their image all over the United States. I hate to admit it but McEwen and Prudhomme showed us the way to the future. They were a lot smarter than most of us who didn't see past the end of the quarter-mile.\"\n\nMcEwen had four children: Jamie, Joe, Tom Jr., and Kathleen,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Burgess |first1=Phil |title=A fond farewell to 'the Mongoose' |url=https://www.nhra.com/news/2018/fond-farewell-mongoose |website=NHRA |accessdate=21 July 2018}}</ref> and two grandchildren: Christian and Jonathan. Jamie and Joe are deceased. \n\n==Early career==\nMcEwen gained his early experience in a variety of cars, beginning in 1953 with a '53 [[Oldsmobile#1950s|Oldsmobile]] at [[Santa Ana Drags]] in [[Irvine, California|Irvine]]. He then went on to race a '54 Olds at [[Lions Drag Strip]] in [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]].\n\nHe went from the [[Stock (drag racing class)|stock]] ranks to [[gasser (car)|gas]] coupes, [[Altered (drag racing)|Altered]]s, and eventually [[Slingshot dragster|dragster]]s and [[Funny Car|funny car]]s. Among the cars he drove were the Stone-Woods-Cook '50 Olds fastback, the Bader and Ferrara [[Cadillac]]-powered ''Crosseyed Crosley'', [[Art Chrisman]]'s ''[[Hustler II]]'', the [[Bud Rasner]] and [[Gary Slusser]] Fiat coupe, [[Dick Rea]]'s Chrysler-powered supercharged<!--not hyphenated...--> gas dragster, and [[Gene Adams]]' Albertson Olds.\n\n==1960s==\nMcEwen continued his relationship with Adams for several years. In 1962, he drove Adams' ''Shark'', which was one of the first dragsters to use a streamlined body with an enclosed parachute pack. This would turn out to be one of McEwen's best known rides.<!--not all were \"dragsters\"...-->\n\nIn 1963, McEwen achieved his first major success when he a runner-up<!--it's not a \"second place\" so much when you get to a final against just one other driver--> finish against [[Art Malone]] at the [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]] March Meet in California in the Broussard-Garrison-Purcell-Davis car.

There, Prudhomme in the ''B&M Torkmaster Special'' took the win, with a 7.59 [[Drag racing#Glossary|e.t.]] to McEwen's 7.69. They would not meet again for the rest of the decade.\n\nMcEwen won the 1966 ''[[Hot Rod (magazine)|Hot Rod]]'' Magazine Championships at [[Riverside Raceway]] and then went on to win the 1968 Stardust National Open in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]. He also recorded the lowest ever elapsed time to date with a blistering 6.64 at the [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] PDA Meet in 1968.\n\n===The promoter===\nMcEwen also continued to build on his reputation as a colorful promoter. The Plymouth [[Plymouth Barracuda|Hemi Cuda]]<ref name=\"srot\"/> he unveiled in 1965 was featured in every major car magazine. He convinced the Southern California Plymouth Dealers Association to support him and displayed the car all over the West Coast.\n\nIn 1967, McEwen took the same approach with one of drag racing's great one-shot wonders, Ford's [[Super Mustang]]. The car stole the show when it made its debut at the Winternationals.\n\n====Wildlife Racing====\nMcEwen's strong promotional talent and Prudhomme's success on the strip eventually led the two to form a national touring team, sponsored by the toy company [[Mattel]], and in mid-1969, McEwen and Prudhomme became co-owners of \"Wildlife Racing.\"<ref name=sitfoe>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UNMVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5xEEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3399%2C101709 |newspaper=Milwaukee Sentinel |last=Bochat |first=Rel |title=Son's illness tough foe for dragster |date=July 1, 1977 |page=1, part 2}}</ref> The Mattel [[Hot Wheels]] sponsorship deal ran from 1970 through 1972.

A year later, he scored his first NHRA national event victory by topping the quickest<!--quickest & fastest are not the same thing in drag racing--> Funny Car field in history at the SuperNationals at [[Ontario Motor Speedway]].\n\nHe went on to win four more national events, including his dramatic [[NHRA U.S. Nationals|U.S. Nationals]] Funny Car victory over Prudhomme in 1978.

He was ''Kantor'' at the [[Neust\u00e4dter Kirche, Hannover]], from 1972 to 1991, where he focused on music in church services, but also conducted concerts, with a preference for works of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and his own teacher [[Ernst Pepping]]. He was appointed [[Kirchenmusikdirektor]] (church music director), responsible for the church music of Hanover.\n\n== Career ==\n\n[[File:Hildesheim Lambertikirche 01.jpg|thumb|[[St. Lamberti, Hildesheim]], where he worked from 1954 to 1972]]\nBorn in [[Rheinsberg]], he studied in Berlin at the [[Spandauer Kirchenmusikschule]] (Spandau academy of church music) with [[Gottfried Grote]], [[Ernst Pepping]] and Herbert Schulze.<ref name=\"Hampel\" /> He was cantor at [[St. Lamberti, Hildesheim]] from 1954.

He performed Bach's ''[[Clavier-\u00dcbung III|Clavier\u00fcbung III]]'' with his wife Maria on two organs in 1986. Each autumn, the choir toured with an [[a cappella]] program.<ref name=\"Kantorei30\" /> In 1980 it included a concert at the [[Marktkirche, Wiesbaden|Marktkirche in Wiesbaden]], with [[Leonhard Lechner]]'s [[motet]] {{lang|de|Ach Gott, Dir tu ich klagen}}, Bach's motet {{lang|de|[[Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf, BWV 226|''Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf'', BWV 226]]|italic=unset}} and Pepping's {{lang|la|[[Missa Dona nobis pacem|Missa ''Dona nobis pacem'']]|italic=unset}}.<ref name=\"Hampel\" /> Destinations have included Copenhagen (1972), Paris (1973), [[Stra\u00dfburg]] (1979) and [[Vaduz]] (1987), and small towns that do not support choirs.<ref name=\"Kantorei30\" />\n\nEgidi founded a chamber orchestra ''Kammerorchester St. Johannis'', mostly of teachers and students of the [[Musikhochschule Hannover]], to play with the choir and perform instrumental concerts.

The last movement, ''[[Mass in B minor structure#Dona nobis pacem|Dona nobis pacem]]'' (Give us peace), matched a visible participation of members of the [[Peace movement##Germany|Peace movement]] in the audience.

In northern Italy, it is a [[suffragan]] of the [[Archdiocese of Modena-Nonantola]]. The historic '''Diocese of Piacenza''' was combined with the territory of the [[diocese of Bobbio-San Colombano]], which was briefly united with the [[archdiocese of Genoa]].\n\nPiacenza was originally a suffragan (subordinate, as part of the ecclesiastical province) of Milan. Bishop Majorianus was one of the bishops who attended the synod of Milan called by Archbishop Eusebius in 451. Piacenza was certainly suffragan to Ravenna by the time of the Roman synod of 680.<ref>Pietro Piacenza (1900), pp. 4-7.</ref>\n\nOn 21 October 1106, [[Pope Paschal II]], at the Council of Guastalla, removed the dioceses of Emilia from the metropolitanate of Ravenna, and made them directly dependent upon the Holy See (papacy). This action was in punishment for the schism carried on by Archbishop Wibert of Ravenna ([[Antipope Clement III]]), in concert with the [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry IV]].<ref>Kehr, p. 57 no. 188, quoting the \"Vita Paschalis II auctore Bosone\": ''Paschalis II in concilio apud villam Guardastallum, a. d. inc. 1106, 11 kal. nov. celebrate constituit, ut Aemilia tota cum suis urbibus, id est Placentia, Parma, Regio, Mutina, Bononia, nunquam ulterius Ravennati metropoli subiaceat.''</ref> On 7 August 1118, [[Pope Gelasius II]] withdrew Pope Paschal's order, and returned the dioceses to the metropolitanate of Ravenna;<ref>Pope Gelasius fled from Rome at the end of August 1118, and died in France on 29 January 1119.

On 9 November 1148, however, he wrote to Bishop-elect Joannes, ordering him to have himself consecrated by the Archbishop of Ravenna. After resisting for more than two years, Giovanni finally submitted to the Pope's order, and was consecrated by the Archbishop of Ravenna on 3 July 1151.<ref>Piacenza, ''Cronotassi'', p. 9. Jaff\u00e9, II, p. 60 no. 9299. ''Est enim quasi peccatum ariolandi repugnare, et velut scelus idololatriae est nolle aquiescere.

They solicited the intervention of Abbot [[Peter the Venerable]] of Cluny, informing him of their point of view, that their metropolitan was the pope, not the Archbishops of Aquileia or Ravenna. They noted that Urban II and Calixtus II had consecrated their bishops.<ref>Piacenza, ''Cronotassi'', p. 9. Abbot Peter states in his letter to Pope Eugenius in 1151 the claim of Piacenza: ''Metropolitanus noster non Ravennas, non Aquileiensis, non quilibet alter, sed Romanus Pontifex est, probandus hoc innumeris testibus, probamus placentinumn electum a multis retro saeculis a summo et universali praesule, non ab alio consecratum. Probamus inde pro exemplo praeter antiquiores, Urbanum secundum, Callixtum secundum, qui electis nostris consecrationis manus imposuerunt.'' The letter is given in full by Campi, II, pp. 351-352, cf. pp. 1-3.</ref> In 1155, with a new Pope, [[Pope Adrian IV|Adrian IV]] and a new bishop of Piacenza, Ugo Pierleoni, the matter was raised again, and Adrian issued a bull exempting Bishop Ugo from subjection to Ravenna, while at the same time claiming an inability to decide the issue between Ravenna and Piacenza.<ref>Kehr, p. 452 no. 52. Piacenza, ''Cronotassi'', pp. 11-13.</ref> In March 1179, Bishop Tedaldo was present at the [[Third Lateran Council]] in Rome, and he subscribed along with the bishops directly dependent upon the Holy See (papacy), not with the suffragans of Ravenna.<ref>Piacenza, ''Cronotassi'', p. 13.</ref>\n\nIn 1582 the diocese of Bologna was raised to the status of a metropolitan archbishopric. Piacenza was made a suffragan of the [[Archdiocese of Bologna]] by [[Pope Gregory XIII]] in the bull ''Universi orbis'' of 10 December 1582.<ref>{{cite book|title=Bullarum diplomatum et privilegiorum sanctorum Romanorum pontificum Taurinensis editio|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=selEAAAAcAAJ|volume=Tomus octavus (8)|year=1863|publisher=Franco et Dalmazzo|location=Turin|language=Latin|pages=401\u2013404, \u00a7 4.}}</ref>\n\nIn 1806, in accordance with faculties specially granted to him by [[Pope Pius VII]] on 5 April 1806, Cardinal Giovanni Battista Caprara removed the dioceses of Piacenza, San Donnino, and Parma from the jurisdiction of the metropolitan Archdiocese of Bologna, and attached them to the Archdiocese of Genoa.

He was in Spain, acting as [[Pope Gregory XIII]]'s Nuncio to the court of King [[Philip II of Spain]]. He was already a bishop, the second Bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of San Benedetto del Tronto-Ripatransone-Montalto|Ripatransone]]. He continued as Nuncio in Spain until the end of 1581, and did not enter Piacenza until the Spring of 1582.<ref>Angel Fern\u00e1ndez Collado (1991), ''Gregorio XIII y Felipe II en la nunciatura de Felipe Sega (1577-1581): aspectos pol\u00edtico, jurisdiccional y de reforma.''

(in Spanish)</ref> After little more than a year in the diocese, he was again appointed papal Nuncio to Spain on 20 September 1583, and, due to a serious illness at the end of the mission, which incapacitated him for five months in Barcelona, he did not return to Piacenza until June 1584.<ref>Fern\u00e1ndez Collado, pp. 33-34.</ref>\n\nA new pope, [[Sixtus V]], who had heard of his reforming efforts in his diocese, summoned him to Rome and appointed him, on 24 April 1585, one of the Reformers of the clergy and clerical institutions of the city of Rome. His tenure was not long, however, for the Pope appointed him Nuncio to the Holy Roman Emperor [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]] in Vienna on 18 January 1586, a post which he held until 28 May 1587.<ref>Fern\u00e1ndez Collado, p. 34.</ref> On his return, during his second period of residence, he further advanced the reforms mandated by the [[Council of Trent]], and held a diocesan synod on 3\u20135 May 1589.<ref>{{cite book|author=Filippo Sega|title=Synodus dioecesana sub Dom.

He was made a cardinal in 1591 and replaced Caetani as Legate in 1592. He did not return to Italy until the summer of 1594, when he took up his duties at the Papal Curia in Rome.<ref>Ludwig von Pastor, ''The History of the Popes'' (ed. R. F. Kerr), [https://archive.org/details/historyofpopesf21past/page/n5 Volume XXI] (London: Kegan Paul 1932), pp. 329-331.</ref>\n\nA beneficial side-effect of the Bishop's frequent absences was that Piacenza did not fall under subordination (suffragan status) to any of the neighboring metropolitanates. The [[Council of Trent]] had decreed that every bishop should attend regular provincial synods, and that those bishops who were directly dependent upon the Holy See (the pope) should choose a provincial synod to attend. Cardinal [[Carlo Borromeo]] of Milan was especially enthusiastic for Tridentine reform, and held frequent diocesan and provincial synods, inviting the bishops of Piacenza to the latter. They either attended under the stipulation that no suffragan status was implied or created,<ref>Bishop Paolo Burali attended the 2nd provincial synod in 1569, and left the following subscription in the Acts of the synod: ''Praemissa contestation libertate meae et Ecclesiae meae tamquam Episcopus exemptus et non subiectus, sed iure electionis tantum ex praescripto s. concilii tridentini, Ego Paulus Episcopus Placentinus consentiens subscripsi.'' Piacenza, ''Cronotassi'', p. 25.</ref> or declined to appear. Borromeo even tried to get the Cathedral Chapter of Piacenza to send a delegation, but they too declined, on the grounds that cathedral chapters were not members of a provincial council. Sega, who was engaged in diplomatic activities, was unable to respond to an invitation (or a summons) to Borromeo's 5th (1579) or 6th (1582) synod; Borromeo had intended to hold a 7th in 1585, but he died in the meantime, and the matter lapsed. The 7th provincial synod of Milan finally took place in 1609, and Bishop Rangoni of Piacenza did not attend. The archbishop of Ravenna also tried to summon Piacenza, in 1582, and his effort too failed.<ref>Piacenza, pp. 25-27.</ref>\n\n===Cathedral and Chapter===\n\nThe construction of the original cathedral was attributed to Bishop Victor, the first bishop known by name, and was dedicated to Saint Antoninus. It was referred to as the ''Victorana Ecclesia''.<ref>Ughelli, p. 196.</ref> A new building was constructed by Bishop Seufridus (839\u2013870), and dedicated to the Virgin Mary and Saint Justina, possibly [[Justina of Padua]] or perhaps [[Cyprian and Justina|Justina of Antioch]], both of whose stories are fictional. The second cathedral was completed by Bishop Paulus (870\u2013 c. 885), and some remains of Justina were given to the cathedral by Bishop Joannes Philagathos the [[Antipope John XVI]] (982\u2013997). [[Piacenza Cathedral|The cathedral]] was ruined in the great earthquake of 1117 and was completely rebuilt beginning in 1122.<ref>Kehr, p. 460.</ref> It is claimed, in the Chronocle of Piacenza, that the cathedral was dedicated by Pope Calixtus II on 23 October 1123, but, as Paul Fridolin Kehr has pointed out, Calixtus visited Piacenza in April 1120, while on the alleged consecration day he was in Benevento.<ref>Campi, I, p. 391. Kehr, p. 461, no. 1.</ref>\n\nIn 1747, the Chapter had six dignities (including the Archdeacon, the Provost, the Vicedominus, the Archpriest, the Dean, and the Primicerius) and thirty Canons.<ref>Ughelli, p. 195. Cappelletti, p. 11. Ritzler-Sefrin, ''Hierarchia catholica'' VI, p. 341, note 1.</ref>\n\n===Synods===\nA diocesan synod was an irregular but important meeting of the bishop of a diocese and his clergy. Its purpose was (1) to proclaim generally the various decrees already issued by the bishop; (2) to discuss and ratify measures on which the bishop chose to consult with his clergy; (3) to publish statutes and decrees of the diocesan synod, of the provincial synod, and of the Holy See.<ref name=\"XIV1842\">{{cite book|author=Benedictus XIV|title=Benedicti XIV ...

In northern Italy, it is a [[suffragan]] of the [[Archdiocese of Modena-Nonantola]]. The historic '''Diocese of Piacenza''' was combined with the territory of the [[diocese of Bobbio-San Colombano]], which was briefly united with the [[archdiocese of Genoa]]. \n\nPiacenza was originally a suffragan (subordinate, as part of the ecclesiastical province) of Milan. Bishop Majorianus was one of the bishops who attended the synod of Milan called by Archbishop Eusebius in 451. Piacenza was certainly suffragan to Ravenna by the time of the Roman synod of 680.<ref>Pietro Piacenza (1900), pp. 4-7.</ref>\n\nOn 21 October 1106, [[Pope Paschal II]], at the Council of Guastalla, removed the dioceses of Emilia from the metropolitanate of Ravenna, and made them directly dependent upon the Holy See (papacy). This action was in punishment for the schism carried on by Archbishop Wibert of Ravenna ([[Antipope Clement III]]), in concert with the [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry IV]].<ref>Kehr, p. 57 no. 188, quoting the \"Vita Paschalis II auctore Bosone\": ''Paschalis II in concilio apud villam Guardastallum, a. d. inc. 1106, 11 kal. nov. celebrate constituit, ut Aemilia tota cum suis urbibus, id est Placentia, Parma, Regio, Mutina, Bononia, nunquam ulterius Ravennati metropoli subiaceat.''</ref> On 7 August 1118, [[Pope Gelasius II]] withdrew Pope Paschal's order, and returned the dioceses to the metropolitanate of Ravenna;<ref>Pope Gelasius fled from Rome at the end of August 1118, and died in France on 29 January 1119.

On 9 November 1148, however, he wrote to Bishop-elect Joannes, ordering him to have himself consecrated by the Archbishop of Ravenna. After resisting for more than two years, Giovanni finally submitted to the Pope's order, and was consecrated by the Archbishop of Ravenna on 3 July 1151.<ref>Piacenza, ''Cronotassi'', p. 9. Jaff\u00e9, II, p. 60 no. 9299. ''Est enim quasi peccatum ariolandi repugnare, et velut scelus idololatriae est nolle aquiescere.

They solicited the intervention of Abbot [[Peter the Venerable]] of Cluny, informing him of their point of view, that their metropolitan was the pope, not the Archbishops of Aquileia or Ravenna. They noted that Urban II and Calixtus II had consecrated their bishops.<ref>Piacenza, ''Cronotassi'', p. 9. Abbot Peter states in his letter to Pope Eugenius in 1151 the claim of Piacenza: ''Metropolitanus noster non Ravennas, non Aquileiensis, non quilibet alter, sed Romanus Pontifex est, probandus hoc innumeris testibus, probamus placentinumn electum a multis retro saeculis a summo et universali praesule, non ab alio consecratum. Probamus inde pro exemplo praeter antiquiores, Urbanum secundum, Callixtum secundum, qui electis nostris consecrationis manus imposuerunt.'' The letter is given in full by Campi, II, pp. 351-352, cf. pp. 1-3.</ref> In 1155, with a new Pope, [[Pope Adrian IV|Adrian IV]] and a new bishop of Piacenza, Ugo Pierleoni, the matter was raised again, and Adrian issued a bull exempting Bishop Ugo from subjection to Ravenna, while at the same time claiming an inability to decide the issue between Ravenna and Piacenza.<ref>Kehr, p. 452 no. 52. Piacenza, ''Cronotassi'', pp. 11-13.</ref> In March 1179, Bishop Tedaldo was present at the [[Third Lateran Council]] in Rome, and he subscribed along with the bishops directly dependent upon the Holy See (papacy), not with the suffragans of Ravenna.<ref>Piacenza, ''Cronotassi'', p. 13.</ref>\n\nIn 1582 the diocese of Bologna was raised to the status of a metropolitan archbishopric. Piacenza was made a suffragan of the [[Archdiocese of Bologna]] by [[Pope Gregory XIII]] in the bull ''Universi orbis'' of 10 December 1582.<ref>{{cite book|title=Bullarum diplomatum et privilegiorum sanctorum Romanorum pontificum Taurinensis editio|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=selEAAAAcAAJ|volume=Tomus octavus (8)|year=1863|publisher=Franco et Dalmazzo|location=Turin|language=Latin|pages=401\u2013404, \u00a7 4.}}</ref>\n\nIn 1806, in accordance with faculties specially granted to him by [[Pope Pius VII]] on 5 April 1806, Cardinal Giovanni Battista Caprara removed the dioceses of Piacenza, San Donnino, and Parma from the jurisdiction of the metropolitan Archdiocese of Bologna, and attached them to the Archdiocese of Genoa.

He was already a bishop, the second Bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of San Benedetto del Tronto-Ripatransone-Montalto|Ripatransone]]. He continued as Nuncio in Spain until the end of 1581, and did not enter Piacenza until the Spring of 1582.<ref>Angel Fern\u00e1ndez Collado (1991), ''Gregorio XIII y Felipe II en la nunciatura de Felipe Sega (1577-1581): aspectos pol\u00edtico, jurisdiccional y de reforma.''

Kerr), [https://archive.org/details/historyofpopesf21past/page/n5 Volume XXI] (London: Kegan Paul 1932), pp. 329-331.</ref>\n\nA beneficial side-effect of the Bishop's frequent absences was that Piacenza did not fall under subordination (suffragan status) to any of the neighboring metropolitanates. The [[Council of Trent]] had decreed that every bishop should attend regular provincial synods, and that those bishops who were directly dependent upon the Holy See (the pope) should choose a provincial synod to attend. Cardinal [[Carlo Borromeo]] of Milan was especially enthusiastic for Tridentine reform, and held frequent diocesan and provincial synods, inviting the bishops of Piacenza to the latter. They either attended under the stipulation that no suffragan status was implied or created,<ref>Bishop Paolo Burali attended the 2nd provincial synod in 1569, and left the following subscription in the Acts of the synod: ''Praemissa contestation libertate meae et Ecclesiae meae tamquam Episcopus exemptus et non subiectus, sed iure electionis tantum ex praescripto s. concilii tridentini, Ego Paulus Episcopus Placentinus consentiens subscripsi.'' Piacenza, ''Cronotassi'', p. 25. </ref> or declined to appear. Borromeo even tried to get the Cathedral Chapter of Piacenza to send a delegation, but they too declined, on the grounds that cathedral chapters were not members of a provincial council. Sega, who was engaged in diplomatic activities, was unable to respond to an invitation (or a summons) to Borromeo's 5th (1579) or 6th (1582) synod; Borromeo had intended to hold a 7th in 1585, but he died in the meantime, and the matter lapsed. The 7th provincial synod of Milan finally took place in 1609, and Bishop Rangoni of Piacenza did not attend. The archbishop of Ravenna also tried to summon Piacenza, in 1582, and his effort too failed.<ref>Piacenza, pp. 25-27.</ref>\n\n===Cathedral and Chapter===\n\nThe construction of the original cathedral was attributed to Bishop Victor, the first bishop known by name, and was dedicated to Saint Antoninus. It was referred to as the ''Victorana Ecclesia''.<ref>Ughelli, p. 196.</ref> A new building was constructed by Bishop Seufridus (839\u2013870), and dedicated to the Virgin Mary and Saint Justina, possibly [[Justina of Padua]] or perhaps [[Cyprian and Justina|Justina of Antioch]], both of whose stories are fictional. The second cathedral was completed by Bishop Paulus (870\u2013 c. 885), and some remains of Justina were given to the cathedral by Bishop Joannes Philagathos the [[Antipope John XVI]] (982\u2013997). [[Piacenza Cathedral|The cathedral]] was ruined in the great earthquake of 1117 and was completely rebuilt beginning in 1122.<ref>Kehr, p. 460.</ref> It is claimed, in the Chronocle of Piacenza, that the cathedral was dedicated by Pope Calixtus II on 23 October 1123, but, as Paul Fridolin Kehr has pointed out, Calixtus visited Piacenza in April 1120, while on the alleged consecration day he was in Benevento.<ref>Campi, I, p. 391. Kehr, p. 461, no. 1.</ref>\n\nIn 1747, the Chapter had six dignities (including the Archdeacon, the Provost, the Vicedominus, the Archpriest, the Dean, and the Primicerius) and thirty Canons.<ref>Ughelli, p. 195.

Ritzler-Sefrin, ''Hierarchia catholica'' VI, p. 341, note 1.</ref>\n\n===Synods===\nA diocesan synod was an irregular but important meeting of the bishop of a diocese and his clergy. Its purpose was (1) to proclaim generally the various decrees already issued by the bishop; (2) to discuss and ratify measures on which the bishop chose to consult with his clergy; (3) to publish statutes and decrees of the diocesan synod, of the provincial synod, and of the Holy See.<ref name=\"XIV1842\">{{cite book|author=Benedictus XIV|title=Benedicti XIV ...

Many Toronto citizens, and especially a group known as \"Streetcars for Toronto\" led by transit advocate [[Steve Munro]], had fought successfully against the TTC's plan to convert the remaining streetcar lines to buses, which necessitated a new streetcar model to replace the aging PCCs. The \"Canadian Light Rail Vehicle\" was an attempt at a new, standardized streetcar design to be used in Toronto and in other new streetcar developments throughout the country. There was also a similar attempt of this \"standardized vehicle\" concept made in the United States around the same time with the [[US Standard Light Rail Vehicle]], with cars built by [[Boeing Rotorcraft Systems|Boeing Vertol]] for Boston's [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority]] and the [[San Francisco Municipal Railway]].\n\n[[Hawker Siddeley Canada]] proposed their version of a streetcar in 1972 known as the Municipal Service Car, which had a [[Railbus|bus-like chassis]] and a [[Low-floor tram|semi-low floor]] design with front and rear doors similar to that of the CLRV fleet. The project was abandoned the following year when the TTC selected the CLRV design. No Municipal Service Car prototypes were ever produced and only concept drawings remain of this vehicle.\n\nThe first six CLRV cars (4000\u20134005) were manufactured by [[Schweizerische Industrie Gesellschaft|SIG]] of [[Zurich]], Switzerland, and used as [[prototype]]s for [[Urban Transportation Development Corporation]] (UTDC) (now [[Bombardier Transportation|Bombardier]]) to manufacture subsequent CLRVs at the [[Thunder Bay]] works of [[Hawker Siddeley Canada]] (today also part of Bombardier). The original order was for 200 CLRVs, of which ten were to be built by SIG and 190 by Hawker Siddeley. However, the order was reduced by four vehicles to 196 in order to provide parts to construct a prototype Articulated Light Rail Vehicle (number 4900). The four CLRVs removed were from the SIG portion of the order; thus, there were no CLRVs numbered 4006\u20134009. The 190 Hawker Siddeley CLRVs were numbered 4010\u20134199.<ref name=\"RwyAge-2018-01-05\" /><ref name=\"TT-CLRV\" /> CLRV car 4000 had a [[Pantograph (transport)|pantograph]] when being tested by SIG on the [[Orbe-Chavornay railway]] and was converted to [[trolley pole]] before being delivered to Toronto.<ref name=\"TT-CLRV\" />\n\nOn December 29, 1977, the first CLRV, SIG-built 4002, arrived at the [[Hillcrest Complex]] aboard a railway flatcar. On September 30, 1979, after a year of testing and modification, CLRVs started service on route [[507 Long Branch]] (today the western portion of route [[501 Queen]]).<ref name=\"RwyAge-2018-01-05\" />\n\nTwenty-two CLRVs were to run on an open-track [[Line 3 Scarborough|Scarborough LRT line]] (to be later built as an [[Intermediate Capacity Transit System|ICTS]] line). Thus, for suburban operation, the UTDC originally specified an outside-frame bogie that later proved problematic in street operation,<ref name=\"RwyAge-2018-01-05\" /> and designed the vehicles for speeds up to {{convert|70|mph|order=flip}}. The bogies would derail at switches in street trackage and have noise and vibration problems.<ref name=\"SteveMunro-2007-10-21\" /> Replacing the original Bochum wheels with SAB wheels (similar to PCC wheels) corrected these problems. The Bochum wheels had a rubber layer between the hub and the steel tire (rim), which would flex rather than pulling the opposite wheel through a [[Railroad switch#Single-point switch|single-point switch]].<ref name=\"SteveMunro-2006-12-29\" />\n\nThe CLRV electronics include 1970s-era solid state power controls. In later years, the propulsion control system became unreliable and difficult to maintain as obsolete electronic and electrical parts became difficult to source.<ref name=\"SteveMunro-2006-12-29\" />\n\nThe CLRVs originally had sealed windows and no air conditioning. Later, the windows were modified to allow passengers to open them.<ref name=\"SteveMunro-2006-12-29\" />\n\nThe CLRVs were delivered with couplers for multiple-unit operation. Between 1984 and 1988, the couplers were removed, and a safety shield was placed over the front coupler pocket.<ref name=\"TT-CLRV\" />\n\n===<span id=\"ALRV\"></span>ALRV===\nAs with the CLRV prototypes, the ALRV prototype, numbered 4900, was tested with a pantograph on standard gauge tracks before delivery to the TTC. Built in 1982, prototype 4900 had features that were not implemented on either CLRVs or production ALRVs such as hand controls instead of foot controls, and electronic destination signs instead of linen rollsigns.<ref name=\"TT-ALRV\" /> The prototype had couplers while subsequent production units did not.<ref name=\"SteveMunro-2010-06-16\">{{cite web |url=https://stevemunro.ca/2010/06/16/multiple-unit-clrv-and-alrv-operation/ |title=Multiple Unit CLRV and ALRV Operation |publisher=[[Steve Munro]] |first=Steve |last=Munro |date=June 16, 2010 |accessdate=January 14, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180115124737/https://stevemunro.ca/2010/06/16/multiple-unit-clrv-and-alrv-operation/ |archive-date=January 15, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nPrototype 4900 ran trials in Toronto from August 10, 1982, until February 25, 1983, with a break when it was displayed at the 1982 [[Canadian National Exhibition]]. After completion of the trial runs, car 4900 was stored at the St. Clair Carhouse until March 7, 1987, when it was shipped to the UTDC testing facility in [[Kingston, Ontario]]. On March 24, 1988, following a test run, it was rear-ended by another streetcar on the test track and suffered extensive damage. It was scrapped in 1997.<ref name=\"TT-ALRV\" />\n\nThe 52 production ALRV cars were built by UTDC using [[bogie]]s and [[Articulated joint|articulations]] supplied by [[MAN SE]] of [[Germany]]. Assembly of the first 11 cars took place in Thunder Bay, while that of the remaining 41 cars took place in Kingston. They are numbered 4200\u20134251.\n\nThe first production ALRV, number 4200, was shipped to Toronto on June 11, 1987. It underwent further testing and modifications after its arrival. Car 4204 was the first of the production ALRVs to go into revenue service, doing so on the [[507 Long Branch]] route on January 19, 1988.<ref name=\"TT-ALRV\" />\n\n=== Marketing ===\nThe previous attempt (made in the United States) to design a [[US Standard Light Rail Vehicle|US standard light rail car]] was unsuccessful, and the resulting cars proved troublesome to both transit systems that had purchased them. While the CLRV had fared better for Toronto's streetcar system, other cities in both the US and Canada expressed little interest in the design, which thus remained almost exclusive to Toronto's streetcar system. This made the cars increasingly difficult and costly to maintain, as they required specially-made parts, including electronic modules no longer available.\n \nIn 1980, cars 4027, 4029 and 4031 were leased and tested by the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority]] (MBTA) to run on the [[Green Line (MBTA)|Green Line]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://photos.nerail.org/showpic/?2009011201452929774.jpg:bysearch:clrv:SEARCHTYPE=SIMPLE&PAGE=1&BOOL=ALL&SEARCHSTRING=clrv |title=4029 and 4031 at Arborway Station in Boston, Massachusetts |access-date=February 22, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526185450/http://photos.nerail.org/showpic/?2009011201452929774.jpg:bysearch:clrv:SEARCHTYPE=SIMPLE&PAGE=1&BOOL=ALL&SEARCHSTRING=clrv |archive-date=May 26, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> During this time, the cars were occasionally operated as two- and three-car trains. However, the MBTA did not adopt the CLRV design for its light rail fleet.<ref name=\"TT-CLRV\" />\n\nOther than the TTC, the UTDC had only one other buyer for its light rail products. The [[Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority light rail|Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority]] purchased 50 vehicles that were double-ended and articulated. They were subsequently sold second hand to [[Sacramento RT Light Rail|Sacramento]] and [[TRAX (light rail)|Salt Lake City]].<ref name=\"TT-CLRV\" />\n\nCLRVs were built with couplers for multiple-unit control. Although not used in Toronto, the CLRV could be configured for double-end operation and high-platform boarding.<ref name=\"RwyAge-2018-01-05\" />\n\n== Characteristics ==\nThe design and operation of the CLRVs and ALRVs carried over features from the highly successful PCCs that they replaced, having a similar interior layout, and the same two green bull's-eye lights in the upper corners of the front, above the [[destination sign]], which uses back-lit [[rollsign|roller boards]]. Braking and acceleration were controlled by the operator with the same pedal layout used on the PCC's, including the [[dead man's switch]] which was used to apply the [[parking brake]] when the vehicle was not in motion.\n\nOther features include fluorescent lighting and chopper controls to save energy.<ref name=\"RwyAge-2018-01-05\" />\n\nUnlike the CLRVs, the ALRVs have a large box sitting on the roof of each of the two articulated sections. Each box houses an air intake to ventilate the larger ALRV interior. All of the TTC's ALRVs were delivered without couplers, and a safety shield covers both of the empty front and rear coupler pockets.<ref name=\"TT-ALRV\" /> Compared with the CLRVs, the ALRVs had limited acceleration due to their extra weight and because trolley pole pickup limited the amount of power they could draw.<ref name=\"SteveMunro-2006-12-29\" />\n\nWhen the CLRVs and ALRVs were delivered in the 1970s and 1980s respectively, they were equipped with [[gong]]s as the sole audible [[warning signal]]. Most cars were retrofitted with [[vehicle horn|horns]] in the late 1990s to combat automobile accidents when the [[510 Spadina]] right-of-way streetcar opened. Initially, the horns were salvaged from retired [[H-series (Toronto subway car)|H1]] and [[M-series (Toronto subway car)|M1]] subway cars which were replaced by the [[T-series (Toronto subway car)|T1]] subway cars. However, during the CLRV/ALRV streetcar fleet overhaul project between 2011 and 2012 the TTC reconfigured the streetcar horns with new air horns or automobile-type electric horns.<ref name=\"TT-CLRV\" />\n\n[[File:CLRV 4041 EB at King & Yonge.jpg|thumb|CLRV 4041 with roof-mounted air conditioning unit]]\nCLRV 4041 is the only member of the CLRV/ALRV fleet to have an air conditioning unit, which the TTC installed in 2006. The unit was a long roof-mounted box with beveled sides that gave 4041 a look distinct from that of other CLRVs. TTC operator Stanley Mamaraj{{who|date=September 2019}} described 4041's air conditioning as \"The cool air comes down. You can feel it, it's nice and cool.\"<ref name=\"CityNews-2006-07-26\" /> However, after a ride on 4041, transit advocate Steve Munro described the air conditioning as \"nowhere near as aggressive as it is on some buses or on the T1 subway cars. Moreover, depending on where you are in the car, you may not feel the effect at all because the cool air does not blow out evenly. When I rode back north on a non-A/C car, I sat beside the open window and was actually cooler than I had been on 4041.\"<ref name=\"SteveMunro-2006-07-21\" />\n\nStarting in 2006, the TTC installed a [[Closed-circuit television|Closed-Circuit Television]] (CCTV) security camera system on all surface vehicles including the CLRV/ALRV fleet as well as [[Toronto Transit Commission bus system|buses]]. The system is to deter crime on vehicles and help catch trouble-makers. It uses four cameras to make high-quality images stored in a 24-hour loop.<ref name=\"CityNews-2006-10-30\">{{cite web |url=https://toronto.citynews.ca/2006/10/30/t-t-c-starts-camera-installation-on-buses-streetcars/ |title=T.T.C.

It was essentially a text-based system that could send messages to 10 vehicles at a time, and each operator had to acknowledge the message before Transit Control could communicate with other operators. In 2014, the TTC requested funding for a new radio system.<ref name=\"TO-Life-2014-02-03\">{{cite web |url=http://www.torontolife.com/informer/random-stuff-informer/2013/12/17/ttc-byford-old-equipment/ |title=You'll never believe how ancient the TTC's technology actually is (there's a blacksmith involved) |date=December 17, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203002746/http://www.torontolife.com/informer/random-stuff-informer/2013/12/17/ttc-byford-old-equipment/# |first=Steve |last=Kupferman |archive-date=February 3, 2014 |work=Toronto Life |access-date=November 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\nA [https://www.facebook.com/TorontoTransitCommission/photos/a.188853314238/188853719238/?type=3&theater promotional graphic] published by the TTC in 2009 illustrated that an ALRV could replace 55 automobiles carrying 61 passengers (assuming 1.11 passengers per auto) during the AM rush.<ref name=\"TTC-2013-Oper-Stats\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ttc.ca/About_the_TTC/Operating_Statistics/2013.jsp |title=2013 TTC Operating Statistics |publisher=[[Toronto Transit Commission]] |date=2013 |accessdate={{date|2018-10-31|mdy}} |quote=Unlocking Gridlock |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181127012757/http://ttc.ca/About_the_TTC/Operating_Statistics/2013.jsp |archive-date=November 27, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nSince December 2015, the CLRVs and ALRVs have accepted fare payments by [[Presto card]] and have since been installed system-wide including all TTC buses and subway stations as of December 2016.<ref name=\"TTC PRESTO\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ttc.ca/Fares_and_passes/PRESTO/index.jsp |title=TTC PRESTO Fare System |publisher=[[Toronto Transit Commission]] |date=2018 |accessdate={{date|2018-11-05|mdy}} |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181027152016/http://ttc.ca/Fares_and_passes/PRESTO/index.jsp |archive-date=October 27, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nTo coincide with the Presto rollout on the CLRV/ALRV fleets, the TTC also introduced a [[proof-of-payment]] (POP) system across all streetcar routes in the TTC network (including the CLRV and ALRV streetcar fleets and the aforementioned replacement shuttle buses that operate in place of streetcars) in an effort to speed up services.

The signs on the vehicle identify it as a training car.\n\n==Later years==\nIn 2014, the CLRV and ALRV streetcars began being retired and replaced by [[low-floor tram|low-floor]] Flexity Outlook vehicles, the first of which were put into service on the 510 Spadina route.<ref name=\"TorStar2014-08-31\" /> The replacements were initiated on the basis of the older vehicles being inaccessible to those with disabilities as well as the age and declining reliability of the CLRV and ALRV fleets.\n\n===Accessibility===\nThe CLRV/ALRV cars, like the PCCs, have [[High-floor|high floors]] and steps at every doorway, and are therefore not [[wheelchair accessible]], severely limiting their use by people with [[Physical disability|physical disabilities]].  Furthermore, the doors are separated by vertical stanchions in the centre of each doorway, making each opening too narrow to accommodate wheelchairs, making accessibility retrofits more difficult and costly. With the passage of the [[Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, 2005|Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act]] (AODA) mandating all public transport to be fully accessible by 2025, the TTC saw the need to replace them with [[accessible]] vehicles as early as 2005. TTC staff explored a number of possible means to make the old fleet [[wheelchair]]-accessible, including constructing level boarding platforms, lowering the track level, installing wheelchair lifts, and attaching wheelchair-accessible trailers, but concluded that none of these options were practical,<ref name=\"TTC-2006-02-22\">{{cite web |url=http://autodocbox.com/Electric_Vehicle/71484077-Accessible-transit-services-plan.html |title=Accessible Transit Services Plan \u2013 2006 Status Report |publisher=[[Toronto Transit Commission]] |date={{date|2006-02-22|mdy}} |accessdate={{date|2018-02-22|mdy}} |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180223171420/http://autodocbox.com/Electric_Vehicle/71484077-Accessible-transit-services-plan.html |archive-date=February 23, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"TTC-2009-02-18\" /> and replacing the cars was the best option.\n\nIn 2008, the TTC installed automatic stop announcements on all surface vehicles, including the CLRVs and ALRVs, to satisfy the requirements of the AODA. An LED device displays stop names in text, accompanied by a recorded voice announcing the stop names. This is to aid riders with hearing and vision problems.<ref name=\"TTC-2009-02-18\" /><ref name=\"Torontoist-2007-12-28\" /> In 2016, the TTC announced it would also install external announcement systems on all of its surface vehicle fleet, again including the CLRVs and ALRVs, to announce the route and destination of the vehicle to passengers waiting to board.<ref name=\"TO-2016-02-25\" />\n\nA TTC report in 2015 proposed that it may have continued to use some high-floor inaccessible CLRV/ALRV vehicles to supplement the low-floor Flexity Outlook streetcars during peak hours on selected routes either until approximately 2024, when projections indicated it would have enough of the Flexity vehicles available to provide accessible service on all streetcar routes or if they become impractical to maintain.<ref name=\"TO-2016-02-25\" /> By May 2019, however, the TTC planned to retire the remainder of the CLRV/ALRV fleet by the end of 2019.<ref name=\"TTC-2019-05-08\" />\n\n===Winter operational issues===\nDuring the [[polar vortex]] winter seasons of 2013/2014, 2014/2015, 2017/2018 and 2018/2019, many of the CLRV and ALRV streetcars broke down operating in temperatures below {{convert|-20|C}} due to their age.

Instead, only Flexity Outlook streetcars along with buses were used. The ALRVs remained out of service for the rest of that winter season.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cp24.com/weather/bitterly-cold-temperatures-continue-in-toronto-1.4261802 |title=Bitterly cold temperatures continue in Toronto |work=CP24 |date=January 21, 2019 |access-date=March 15, 2019 |first=Codi |last=Wilson |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190317073628/https://www.cp24.com/weather/bitterly-cold-temperatures-continue-in-toronto-1.4261802 |archive-date=March 17, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe older streetcars use pressurized air passing through tubes and valves to operate such things as suspension, braking, windshield wipers, doors and the rail sander (for traction under icy conditions). Condensation can freeze and block the air tubes causing a variety of malfunctions. Over time, salt erodes the air tanks and the tubing gets brittle and leaks leading to less efficient air flow which may cause the compressor beneath the tail of the car to overheat and break down.<ref name=\"TheStar-2015-12-01\" />\n\nTo address these problems in December 2015, the TTC performed fixes taking 2\u20133 days per streetcar to implement. These included the installation of new air tanks and filters, the replacement of old tubing to the windshield wipers, repairs on the valves controlling air flow to the rail sanders, overhaul of the brake valves, and the correction of any suspension system deficiencies.<ref name=\"TheStar-2015-12-01\">{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/transportation/2015/12/01/aging-ttc-streetcars-rattle-into-winter.html |title=Aging TTC streetcars rattle into winter |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]] |author=Alex Ballingall |date=December 1, 2015 |accessdate=December 4, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151205013946/http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/transportation/2015/12/01/aging-ttc-streetcars-rattle-into-winter.html |archive-date=December 5, 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Replacement parts===\nAs the TTC's CLRV/ALRV streetcar fleet has aged, many parts used by these older streetcars are no longer available from outside suppliers. If a CLRV or ALRV is damaged in a breakdown, collision or derailment, parts need to be replaced or be bent back into shape. For this purpose, the TTC employs a [[blacksmith]] to craft and repair parts. The blacksmith also supplies tools such as switch irons and towing drawbars for streetcars.<ref name=\"blacksmith\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/meet-pat-maietta-the-ttc-s-last-remaining-blacksmith-1.2513352 |title=Meet Pat Maietta, the TTC's last remaining blacksmith |date=January 27, 2014 |work=CBC News |accessdate=October 15, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161224234327/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/meet-pat-maietta-the-ttc-s-last-remaining-blacksmith-1.2513352 |archive-date=December 24, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe use of salt brine to de-ice city streets has corroded parts on the older streetcars so much that such parts must often be cut off the car. The TTC Harvey Shops must manufacture some of the replacements sections, such as the chevrons which attach the bogies to the car body. The upholstery department constructs the bellows used between the articulated sections of the ALRV. Each set of bellows takes 240 hours to construct from a vinyl-like material using electric sewing machines.<ref name=\"TheStar-2016-05-13\" />\n\n===Refurbishment===\nIn 2006, the TTC was planning to refurbish 100 CLRVs to extend their life and possibly to add air conditioning. This plan was shelved by December 2016, and the only visible outcome was that CLRV 4041, effectively a prototype for refurbishment, became the only CLRV with air conditioning, sporting a visually distinct air conditioning unit on its roof.<ref name=\"CityNews-2006-07-26\" /><ref name=\"SteveMunro-2006-12-29\" />\n\nIn June 2015, the TTC started a program to rebuild and extend the life of 30 CLRVs and 30 ALRVs because of delays in delivery of the new Flexity streetcars. 56 employees were assigned to work on this program. Refurbishing each ALRV was expected to take about 55 days and cost $800,000. The cost for each CLRV was expected to be about $200,000. The total cost was budgeted at $33.1{{nbsp}}million. The work was to be completed by 2017.<ref name=\"TheStar-2016-05-13\" /><ref name=\"TheStar-2018-11-12\" />\n \nThe refurbishment of 30 ALRVs alone was budgeted at $24.5{{nbsp}}million, with an option to refurbish another 10. The remaining 12 ALRVs were to be stripped of useful parts and scrapped. The refurbishments included repairing corrosion, repainting, installing new energy-efficient [[LED lighting|LED lights]], upgrading the floors, refreshing the seats, and overhauling the pneumatic, brake and traction systems. This was expected to extend the life of the cars until 2024.<ref name=\"Metro-2015-06-16\" /><ref name=\"TheStar-2018-11-12\" /> The first renovated ALRV (4217) entered service on October 15, 2015.<ref name=\"TTC-2015-10-15\" /> However, the TTC stopped the ALRV refurbishment program after completing 20 cars at a cost of $26{{nbsp}}million. The TTC hoped to have 10 of the refurbished ALRVs in service on any given day, but found that only two or three were fit for service with the others awaiting repairs mainly due to electrical problems. Because of budget constraints, the refurbishing had excluded electrical work.<ref name=\"TheStar-2018-11-12\" />\n\n===Decline===\n[[File:Leslie Barns - retired CLRV & ALRV streetcars (including CLRV 4102).jpg|thumb|Row of retired CLRVs and ALRVs at the Leslie Barns.

In 2006, it was intended to be the first prototype for the TTC's CLRV overhaul program, which was to include a complete reconstruction of the body as well as new propulsion and control systems. However, after the car was stripped, the overhaul program was cancelled. Because of a diminishing supply of spare parts for the active fleet, it was decided that the unit would be scrapped and all usable parts be salvaged for repairs to the existing fleet. The shell was sold for scrap in March 2009 to Future Enterprises of Hamilton, Ontario.<ref name=\"CPTDB-CLRV\">{{cite web |url=https://cptdb.ca/wiki/index.php?title=Toronto_Transit_Commission_4000-4005,_4010-4199 |title=Toronto Transit Commission 4000\u20134005, 4010\u20134199 |publisher=Canadian Public Transit Discussion Board |accessdate=July 26, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141228080048/http://www.cptdb.ca/wiki/index.php?title=Toronto_Transit_Commission_4000-4005,_4010-4199 |archive-date=December 28, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n* ALRV 4231 was retired in mid-2014 and was used to supply parts until its scrapping in May 2015.

However, the engineers working on this had only a vague grasp of transit basics, and they determined that the new cars had to travel at up to 70mph (roughly 110kph) for suburban operations. ... Further problems ensued because the wheels chosen for these vehicles were incompatible with our track, notably at switches where cars tended to derail. This problem was fixed, eventually, along with the worst of the noise and vibration issues by a change to the type of wheel we now see on the CLRVs, itself a descendent of the PCC design.

Many Toronto citizens, and especially a group known as \"Streetcars for Toronto\" led by transit advocate [[Steve Munro]], had fought successfully against the TTC's plan to convert the remaining streetcar lines to buses, which necessitated a new streetcar model to replace the aging PCCs. The \"Canadian Light Rail Vehicle\" was an attempt at a new, standardized streetcar design to be used in Toronto and in other new streetcar developments throughout the country. There was also a similar attempt of this \"standardized vehicle\" concept made in the United States around the same time with the [[US Standard Light Rail Vehicle]], with cars built by [[Boeing Rotorcraft Systems|Boeing Vertol]] for Boston's [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority]] and the [[San Francisco Municipal Railway]].\n\n[[Hawker Siddeley Canada]] proposed their version of a streetcar in 1972 known as the Municipal Service Car, which had a [[Railbus|bus-like chassis]] and a [[Low-floor tram|semi-low floor]] design with front and rear doors similar to that of the CLRV fleet. The project was abandoned the following year when the TTC selected the CLRV design. No Municipal Service Car prototypes were ever produced and only concept drawings remain of this vehicle.\n\nThe first six CLRV cars (4000\u20134005) were manufactured by [[Schweizerische Industrie Gesellschaft|SIG]] of [[Zurich]], Switzerland, and used as [[prototype]]s for [[Urban Transportation Development Corporation]] (UTDC) (now [[Bombardier Transportation|Bombardier]]) to manufacture subsequent CLRVs at the [[Thunder Bay]] works of [[Hawker Siddeley Canada]] (today also part of Bombardier). The original order was for 200 CLRVs, of which ten were to be built by SIG and 190 by Hawker Siddeley. However, the order was reduced by four vehicles to 196 in order to provide parts to construct a prototype Articulated Light Rail Vehicle (number 4900). The four CLRVs removed were from the SIG portion of the order; thus, there were no CLRVs numbered 4006\u20134009. The 190 Hawker Siddeley CLRVs were numbered 4010\u20134199.<ref name=\"RwyAge-2018-01-05\" /><ref name=\"TT-CLRV\" /> CLRV car 4000 had a [[Pantograph (transport)|pantograph]] when being tested by SIG on the [[Orbe-Chavornay railway]] and was converted to [[trolley pole]] before being delivered to Toronto.<ref name=\"TT-CLRV\" />\n\nOn December 29, 1977, the first CLRV, SIG-built 4002, arrived at the [[Hillcrest Complex]] aboard a railway flatcar. On September 30, 1979, after a year of testing and modification, CLRVs started service on route [[507 Long Branch]] (today the western portion of route [[501 Queen]]).<ref name=\"RwyAge-2018-01-05\" />\n\nTwenty-two CLRVs were to run on an open-track [[Line 3 Scarborough|Scarborough LRT line]] (to be later built as an [[Intermediate Capacity Transit System|ICTS]] line). Thus, for suburban operation, the UTDC originally specified an outside-frame bogie that later proved problematic in street operation,<ref name=\"RwyAge-2018-01-05\" /> and designed the vehicles for speeds up to {{convert|70|mph|order=flip}}. The bogies would derail at switches in street trackage and have noise and vibration problems.<ref name=\"SteveMunro-2007-10-21\" /> Replacing the original Bochum wheels with SAB wheels (similar to PCC wheels) corrected these problems. The Bochum wheels had a rubber layer between the hub and the steel tire (rim), which would flex rather than pulling the opposite wheel through a [[Railroad switch#Single-point switch|single-point switch]].<ref name=\"SteveMunro-2006-12-29\" />\n\nThe CLRV electronics include 1970s-era solid state power controls. In later years, the propulsion control system became unreliable and difficult to maintain as obsolete electronic and electrical parts became difficult to source.<ref name=\"SteveMunro-2006-12-29\" />\n\nThe CLRVs originally had sealed windows and no air conditioning. Later, the windows were modified to allow passengers to open them.<ref name=\"SteveMunro-2006-12-29\" />\n\nThe CLRVs were delivered with couplers for multiple-unit operation. Between 1984 and 1988, the couplers were removed, and a safety shield was placed over the front coupler pocket.<ref name=\"TT-CLRV\" />\n\n===<span id=\"ALRV\"></span>ALRV===\nAs with the CLRV prototypes, the ALRV prototype, numbered 4900, was tested with a pantograph on standard gauge tracks before delivery to the TTC. Built in 1982, prototype 4900 had features that were not implemented on either CLRVs or production ALRVs such as hand controls instead of foot controls, and electronic destination signs instead of linen rollsigns.<ref name=\"TT-ALRV\" /> The prototype had couplers while subsequent production units did not.<ref name=\"SteveMunro-2010-06-16\">{{cite web |url=https://stevemunro.ca/2010/06/16/multiple-unit-clrv-and-alrv-operation/ |title=Multiple Unit CLRV and ALRV Operation |publisher=[[Steve Munro]] |first=Steve |last=Munro |date=June 16, 2010 |accessdate=January 14, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180115124737/https://stevemunro.ca/2010/06/16/multiple-unit-clrv-and-alrv-operation/ |archive-date=January 15, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nPrototype 4900 ran trials in Toronto from August 10, 1982, until February 25, 1983, with a break when it was displayed at the 1982 [[Canadian National Exhibition]]. After completion of the trial runs, car 4900 was stored at the St. Clair Carhouse until March 7, 1987, when it was shipped to the UTDC testing facility in [[Kingston, Ontario]]. On March 24, 1988, following a test run, it was rear-ended by another streetcar on the test track and suffered extensive damage. It was scrapped in 1997.<ref name=\"TT-ALRV\" />\n\nThe 52 production ALRV cars were built by UTDC using [[bogie]]s and [[Articulated joint|articulations]] supplied by [[MAN SE]] of [[Germany]]. Assembly of the first 11 cars took place in Thunder Bay, while that of the remaining 41 cars took place in Kingston. They are numbered 4200\u20134251.\n\nThe first production ALRV, number 4200, was shipped to Toronto on June 11, 1987. It underwent further testing and modifications after its arrival. Car 4204 was the first of the production ALRVs to go into revenue service, doing so on the [[507 Long Branch]] route on January 19, 1988.<ref name=\"TT-ALRV\" />\n\n=== Marketing ===\nThe previous attempt (made in the United States) to design a [[US Standard Light Rail Vehicle|US standard light rail car]] was unsuccessful, and the resulting cars proved troublesome to both transit systems that had purchased them. While the CLRV had fared better for Toronto's streetcar system, other cities in both the US and Canada expressed little interest in the design, which thus remained almost exclusive to Toronto's streetcar system. This made the cars increasingly difficult and costly to maintain, as they required specially-made parts, including electronic modules no longer available.\n \nIn 1980, cars 4027, 4029 and 4031 were leased and tested by the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority]] (MBTA) to run on the [[Green Line (MBTA)|Green Line]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://photos.nerail.org/showpic/?2009011201452929774.jpg:bysearch:clrv:SEARCHTYPE=SIMPLE&PAGE=1&BOOL=ALL&SEARCHSTRING=clrv |title=4029 and 4031 at Arborway Station in Boston, Massachusetts |access-date=February 22, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526185450/http://photos.nerail.org/showpic/?2009011201452929774.jpg:bysearch:clrv:SEARCHTYPE=SIMPLE&PAGE=1&BOOL=ALL&SEARCHSTRING=clrv |archive-date=May 26, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> During this time, the cars were occasionally operated as two- and three-car trains. However, the MBTA did not adopt the CLRV design for its light rail fleet.<ref name=\"TT-CLRV\" />\n\nOther than the TTC, the UTDC had only one other buyer for its light rail products. The [[Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority light rail|Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority]] purchased 50 vehicles that were double-ended and articulated. They were subsequently sold second hand to [[Sacramento RT Light Rail|Sacramento]] and [[TRAX (light rail)|Salt Lake City]].<ref name=\"TT-CLRV\" />\n\nCLRVs were built with couplers for multiple-unit control. Although not used in Toronto, the CLRV could be configured for double-end operation and high-platform boarding.<ref name=\"RwyAge-2018-01-05\" />\n\n== Characteristics ==\nThe design and operation of the CLRVs and ALRVs carried over features from the highly successful PCCs that they replaced, having a similar interior layout, and the same two green bull's-eye lights in the upper corners of the front, above the [[destination sign]], which uses back-lit [[rollsign|roller boards]]. Braking and acceleration were controlled by the operator with the same pedal layout used on the PCC's, including the [[dead man's switch]] which was used to apply the [[parking brake]] when the vehicle was not in motion.\n\nOther features include fluorescent lighting and chopper controls to save energy.<ref name=\"RwyAge-2018-01-05\" />\n\nUnlike the CLRVs, the ALRVs have a large box sitting on the roof of each of the two articulated sections. Each box houses an air intake to ventilate the larger ALRV interior. All of the TTC's ALRVs were delivered without couplers, and a safety shield covers both of the empty front and rear coupler pockets.<ref name=\"TT-ALRV\" /> Compared with the CLRVs, the ALRVs had limited acceleration due to their extra weight and because trolley pole pickup limited the amount of power they could draw.<ref name=\"SteveMunro-2006-12-29\" />\n\nWhen the CLRVs and ALRVs were delivered in the 1970s and 1980s respectively, they were equipped with [[gong]]s as the sole audible [[warning signal]]. Most cars were retrofitted with [[vehicle horn|horns]] in the late 1990s to combat automobile accidents when the [[510 Spadina]] right-of-way streetcar opened. Initially, the horns were salvaged from retired [[H-series (Toronto subway car)|H1]] and [[M-series (Toronto subway car)|M1]] subway cars which were replaced by the [[T-series (Toronto subway car)|T1]] subway cars. However, during the CLRV/ALRV streetcar fleet overhaul project between 2011 and 2012 the TTC reconfigured the streetcar horns with new air horns or automobile-type electric horns.<ref name=\"TT-CLRV\" />\n\n[[File:CLRV 4041 EB at King & Yonge.jpg|thumb|CLRV 4041 with roof-mounted air conditioning unit]]\nCLRV 4041 is the only member of the CLRV/ALRV fleet to have an air conditioning unit, which the TTC installed in 2006. The unit was a long roof-mounted box with beveled sides that gave 4041 a look distinct from that of other CLRVs. TTC operator Stanley Mamaraj{{who|date=September 2019}} described 4041's air conditioning as \"The cool air comes down. You can feel it, it's nice and cool.\"<ref name=\"CityNews-2006-07-26\" /> However, after a ride on 4041, transit advocate Steve Munro described the air conditioning as \"nowhere near as aggressive as it is on some buses or on the T1 subway cars. Moreover, depending on where you are in the car, you may not feel the effect at all because the cool air does not blow out evenly. When I rode back north on a non-A/C car, I sat beside the open window and was actually cooler than I had been on 4041.\"<ref name=\"SteveMunro-2006-07-21\" />\n\nStarting in 2006, the TTC installed a [[Closed-circuit television|Closed-Circuit Television]] (CCTV) security camera system on all surface vehicles including the CLRV/ALRV fleet as well as [[Toronto Transit Commission bus system|buses]]. The system is to deter crime on vehicles and help catch trouble-makers. It uses four cameras to make high-quality images stored in a 24-hour loop.<ref name=\"CityNews-2006-10-30\">{{cite web |url=https://toronto.citynews.ca/2006/10/30/t-t-c-starts-camera-installation-on-buses-streetcars/ |title=T.T.C.

It was essentially a text-based system that could send messages to 10 vehicles at a time, and each operator had to acknowledge the message before Transit Control could communicate with other operators. In 2014, the TTC requested funding for a new radio system.<ref name=\"TO-Life-2014-02-03\">{{cite web |url=http://www.torontolife.com/informer/random-stuff-informer/2013/12/17/ttc-byford-old-equipment/ |title=You'll never believe how ancient the TTC's technology actually is (there's a blacksmith involved) |date=December 17, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203002746/http://www.torontolife.com/informer/random-stuff-informer/2013/12/17/ttc-byford-old-equipment/# |first=Steve |last=Kupferman |archive-date=February 3, 2014 |work=Toronto Life |access-date=November 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\nA [https://www.facebook.com/TorontoTransitCommission/photos/a.188853314238/188853719238/?type=3&theater promotional graphic] published by the TTC in 2009 illustrated that an ALRV could replace 55 automobiles carrying 61 passengers (assuming 1.11 passengers per auto) during the AM rush.<ref name=\"TTC-2013-Oper-Stats\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ttc.ca/About_the_TTC/Operating_Statistics/2013.jsp |title=2013 TTC Operating Statistics |publisher=[[Toronto Transit Commission]] |date=2013 |accessdate={{date|2018-10-31|mdy}} |quote=Unlocking Gridlock |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181127012757/http://ttc.ca/About_the_TTC/Operating_Statistics/2013.jsp |archive-date=November 27, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nSince December 2015, the CLRVs and ALRVs have accepted fare payments by [[Presto card]] and have since been installed system-wide including all TTC buses and subway stations as of December 2016.<ref name=\"TTC PRESTO\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ttc.ca/Fares_and_passes/PRESTO/index.jsp |title=TTC PRESTO Fare System |publisher=[[Toronto Transit Commission]] |date=2018 |accessdate={{date|2018-11-05|mdy}} |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181027152016/http://ttc.ca/Fares_and_passes/PRESTO/index.jsp |archive-date=October 27, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nTo coincide with the Presto rollout on the CLRV/ALRV fleets, the TTC also introduced a [[proof-of-payment]] (POP) system across all streetcar routes in the TTC network (including the CLRV and ALRV streetcar fleets and the aforementioned replacement shuttle buses that operate in place of streetcars) in an effort to speed up services.

The signs on the vehicle identify it as a training car.\n\n==Later years==\nIn 2014, the CLRV and ALRV streetcars began being retired and replaced by [[low-floor tram|low-floor]] Flexity Outlook vehicles, the first of which were put into service on the 510 Spadina route.<ref name=\"TorStar2014-08-31\" /> The replacements were initiated on the basis of the older vehicles being inaccessible to those with disabilities as well as the age and declining reliability of the CLRV and ALRV fleets.\n\n===Accessibility===\nThe CLRV/ALRV cars, like the PCCs, have [[High-floor|high floors]] and steps at every doorway, and are therefore not [[wheelchair accessible]], severely limiting their use by people with [[Physical disability|physical disabilities]].  Furthermore, the doors are separated by vertical stanchions in the centre of each doorway, making each opening too narrow to accommodate wheelchairs, making accessibility retrofits more difficult and costly. With the passage of the [[Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, 2005|Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act]] (AODA) mandating all public transport to be fully accessible by 2025, the TTC saw the need to replace them with [[accessible]] vehicles as early as 2005. TTC staff explored a number of possible means to make the old fleet [[wheelchair]]-accessible, including constructing level boarding platforms, lowering the track level, installing wheelchair lifts, and attaching wheelchair-accessible trailers, but concluded that none of these options were practical,<ref name=\"TTC-2006-02-22\">{{cite web |url=http://autodocbox.com/Electric_Vehicle/71484077-Accessible-transit-services-plan.html |title=Accessible Transit Services Plan \u2013 2006 Status Report |publisher=[[Toronto Transit Commission]] |date={{date|2006-02-22|mdy}} |accessdate={{date|2018-02-22|mdy}} |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180223171420/http://autodocbox.com/Electric_Vehicle/71484077-Accessible-transit-services-plan.html |archive-date=February 23, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"TTC-2009-02-18\" /> and replacing the cars was the best option.\n\nIn 2008, the TTC installed automatic stop announcements on all surface vehicles, including the CLRVs and ALRVs, to satisfy the requirements of the AODA. An LED device displays stop names in text, accompanied by a recorded voice announcing the stop names. This is to aid riders with hearing and vision problems.<ref name=\"TTC-2009-02-18\" /><ref name=\"Torontoist-2007-12-28\" /> In 2016, the TTC announced it would also install external announcement systems on all of its surface vehicle fleet, again including the CLRVs and ALRVs, to announce the route and destination of the vehicle to passengers waiting to board.<ref name=\"TO-2016-02-25\" />\n\nA TTC report in 2015 proposed that it may have continued to use some high-floor inaccessible CLRV/ALRV vehicles to supplement the low-floor Flexity Outlook streetcars during peak hours on selected routes either until approximately 2024, when projections indicated it would have enough of the Flexity vehicles available to provide accessible service on all streetcar routes or if they become impractical to maintain.<ref name=\"TO-2016-02-25\" /> By May 2019, however, the TTC planned to retire the remainder of the CLRV/ALRV fleet by the end of 2019.<ref name=\"TTC-2019-05-08\" />\n\n===Winter operational issues===\nDuring the [[polar vortex]] winter seasons of 2013/2014, 2014/2015, 2017/2018 and 2018/2019, many of the CLRV and ALRV streetcars broke down operating in temperatures below {{convert|-20|C}} due to their age.

Instead, only Flexity Outlook streetcars along with buses were used. The ALRVs remained out of service for the rest of that winter season.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cp24.com/weather/bitterly-cold-temperatures-continue-in-toronto-1.4261802 |title=Bitterly cold temperatures continue in Toronto |work=CP24 |date=January 21, 2019 |access-date=March 15, 2019 |first=Codi |last=Wilson |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190317073628/https://www.cp24.com/weather/bitterly-cold-temperatures-continue-in-toronto-1.4261802 |archive-date=March 17, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe older streetcars use pressurized air passing through tubes and valves to operate such things as suspension, braking, windshield wipers, doors and the rail sander (for traction under icy conditions). Condensation can freeze and block the air tubes causing a variety of malfunctions. Over time, salt erodes the air tanks and the tubing gets brittle and leaks leading to less efficient air flow which may cause the compressor beneath the tail of the car to overheat and break down.<ref name=\"TheStar-2015-12-01\" />\n\nTo address these problems in December 2015, the TTC performed fixes taking 2\u20133 days per streetcar to implement. These included the installation of new air tanks and filters, the replacement of old tubing to the windshield wipers, repairs on the valves controlling air flow to the rail sanders, overhaul of the brake valves, and the correction of any suspension system deficiencies.<ref name=\"TheStar-2015-12-01\">{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/transportation/2015/12/01/aging-ttc-streetcars-rattle-into-winter.html |title=Aging TTC streetcars rattle into winter |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]] |author=Alex Ballingall |date=December 1, 2015 |accessdate=December 4, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151205013946/http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/transportation/2015/12/01/aging-ttc-streetcars-rattle-into-winter.html |archive-date=December 5, 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Replacement parts===\nAs the TTC's CLRV/ALRV streetcar fleet has aged, many parts used by these older streetcars are no longer available from outside suppliers. If a CLRV or ALRV is damaged in a breakdown, collision or derailment, parts need to be replaced or be bent back into shape. For this purpose, the TTC employs a [[blacksmith]] to craft and repair parts. The blacksmith also supplies tools such as switch irons and towing drawbars for streetcars.<ref name=\"blacksmith\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/meet-pat-maietta-the-ttc-s-last-remaining-blacksmith-1.2513352 |title=Meet Pat Maietta, the TTC's last remaining blacksmith |date=January 27, 2014 |work=CBC News |accessdate=October 15, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161224234327/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/meet-pat-maietta-the-ttc-s-last-remaining-blacksmith-1.2513352 |archive-date=December 24, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe use of salt brine to de-ice city streets has corroded parts on the older streetcars so much that such parts must often be cut off the car. The TTC Harvey Shops must manufacture some of the replacements sections, such as the chevrons which attach the bogies to the car body. The upholstery department constructs the bellows used between the articulated sections of the ALRV. Each set of bellows takes 240 hours to construct from a vinyl-like material using electric sewing machines.<ref name=\"TheStar-2016-05-13\" />\n\n===Refurbishment===\nIn 2006, the TTC was planning to refurbish 100 CLRVs to extend their life and possibly to add air conditioning. This plan was shelved by December 2016, and the only visible outcome was that CLRV 4041, effectively a prototype for refurbishment, became the only CLRV with air conditioning, sporting a visually distinct air conditioning unit on its roof.<ref name=\"CityNews-2006-07-26\" /><ref name=\"SteveMunro-2006-12-29\" />\n\nIn June 2015, the TTC started a program to rebuild and extend the life of 30 CLRVs and 30 ALRVs because of delays in delivery of the new Flexity streetcars. 56 employees were assigned to work on this program. Refurbishing each ALRV was expected to take about 55 days and cost $800,000. The cost for each CLRV was expected to be about $200,000. The total cost was budgeted at $33.1{{nbsp}}million. The work was to be completed by 2017.<ref name=\"TheStar-2016-05-13\" /><ref name=\"TheStar-2018-11-12\" />\n \nThe refurbishment of 30 ALRVs alone was budgeted at $24.5{{nbsp}}million, with an option to refurbish another 10. The remaining 12 ALRVs were to be stripped of useful parts and scrapped. The refurbishments included repairing corrosion, repainting, installing new energy-efficient [[LED lighting|LED lights]], upgrading the floors, refreshing the seats, and overhauling the pneumatic, brake and traction systems. This was expected to extend the life of the cars until 2024.<ref name=\"Metro-2015-06-16\" /><ref name=\"TheStar-2018-11-12\" /> The first renovated ALRV (4217) entered service on October 15, 2015.<ref name=\"TTC-2015-10-15\" /> However, the TTC stopped the ALRV refurbishment program after completing 20 cars at a cost of $26{{nbsp}}million. The TTC hoped to have 10 of the refurbished ALRVs in service on any given day, but found that only two or three were fit for service with the others awaiting repairs mainly due to electrical problems. Because of budget constraints, the refurbishing had excluded electrical work.<ref name=\"TheStar-2018-11-12\" />\n\n===Decline===\n[[File:Leslie Barns - retired CLRV & ALRV streetcars (including CLRV 4102).jpg|thumb|Row of retired CLRVs and ALRVs at the Leslie Barns.

In 2006, it was intended to be the first prototype for the TTC's CLRV overhaul program, which was to include a complete reconstruction of the body as well as new propulsion and control systems. However, after the car was stripped, the overhaul program was cancelled. Because of a diminishing supply of spare parts for the active fleet, it was decided that the unit would be scrapped and all usable parts be salvaged for repairs to the existing fleet. The shell was sold for scrap in March 2009 to Future Enterprises of Hamilton, Ontario.<ref name=\"CPTDB-CLRV\">{{cite web |url=https://cptdb.ca/wiki/index.php?title=Toronto_Transit_Commission_4000-4005,_4010-4199 |title=Toronto Transit Commission 4000\u20134005, 4010\u20134199 |publisher=Canadian Public Transit Discussion Board |accessdate=July 26, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141228080048/http://www.cptdb.ca/wiki/index.php?title=Toronto_Transit_Commission_4000-4005,_4010-4199 |archive-date=December 28, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n* ALRV 4231 was retired in mid-2014 and was used to supply parts until its scrapping in May 2015.

However, the engineers working on this had only a vague grasp of transit basics, and they determined that the new cars had to travel at up to 70mph (roughly 110kph) for suburban operations. ... Further problems ensued because the wheels chosen for these vehicles were incompatible with our track, notably at switches where cars tended to derail. This problem was fixed, eventually, along with the worst of the noise and vibration issues by a change to the type of wheel we now see on the CLRVs, itself a descendent of the PCC design.

Originally, these missionaries worked out a peaceful compromise with the people of the [[Yaqui River]] valley allowing for the establishment of more than fifty mission settlements. This broke down when the Jesuits opposed the native [[shaman]]ic religious tradition. The [[Opata people]] were more receptive to the missionaries and allied with them.

Originally, these missionaries worked out a peaceful compromise with the people of the [[Yaqui River]] valley allowing for the establishment of more than fifty mission settlements. This broke down when the Jesuits opposed the native [[shaman]]ic religious tradition. The [[Opata people]] were more receptive to the missionaries and allied with them.

Her works of fiction were informed by her literary scholarship but also had a distinctly autobiographical vein, particularly her ''Voci del nord-est'' (1986) and ''II canto delle sirene'' (1989).

Her mother was a pianist who died when Corti was ten years old. After her mother's death, her father, an engineer frequently absent from Milan while working in southern Italy, placed her in a boarding school run by the Sisters of [[Saint Marcellina]]. She would remain there for the next five years. After leaving the boarding school she studied at a [[liceo]] in Milan, living largely on her own apart from summer holidays spent with her father in [[Apulia]]. She then attended the [[University of Milan]] where she would eventually complete two [[laurea]] degrees. The first was in literature in 1936 with a thesis on medieval Latin supervised by [[Benvenuto Terracini]]. The second was in philosophy with a thesis on [[African Spir]] supervised by [[Antonio Banfi]].<ref name = \"RAI\" /><ref name= \"DBI\">Montagnani, Cristina (2013).

From 1939 to 1950 she worked as a teacher in a [[Gymnasium (school)#Italy|ginnasio]] (secondary school for students from age 11 to 16) in Brescia, dedicated herself to private study and writing, and was active in anti-Fascist circles. From 1950 until 1962 she taught at the Alessandro Volta liceo in Como and then at the Cesare Beccaria liceo in Milan. She also held a part-time teaching post at the [[University of Pavia]] from 1955 which she combined with her teaching at the liceo in Milan. After her mentor Benvenuto Terracini had returned from exile in 1947, she renewed her research collaboration with him and formed close personal and intellectual ties with his other students\u2014[[Cesare Segre]], [[Gian Luigi Beccaria]] and [[Bice Mortara Garavelli]]. The ties would last a lifetime, and Corti (who never married) very often spoke of these scholars as her \"family\".<ref name= \"DBI\" /><ref name = \"Segre1\">[[Cesare Segre|Segre, Cesare]] (24 February 2002).

That same year she published her first work of fiction, ''L'ora di tutti'', an historical novel set in [[Otranto]]. She had written two other novels in 1947. The first of these, originally titled ''Il treno della pazienza'' and based on her experiences commuting by train between her teaching job in Brescia and her home in Milan, was published in a revised version in 1981 as ''Cantare al buio''. The second, ''La leggenda di domani'', was published posthumously in 2007 with an introduction by Cesare Segre.

She remained at Pavia for the rest of her career where her scholarship, along with that of Cesare Segre, D'Arco Silvio Avalle, and Dante Isella, Corti's scholarship created the so-called \"Pavia school\" of philology and [[semiotics]]. At Pavia, she also established the ''Fondo Manoscritti di Autori Moderni e Contemporanei'', an extensive curated archive of autograph manuscripts and other documents by 19th- and 20th-century Italian writers. She founded and edited the journal ''Autografo'' which published scholarly work based on material in the archive, as well as two other journals ''[[Alfabeta]]'' and ''Strumenti critici''.<ref name = \"West\"/>\n\nCorti continued working up until the time of her death.

She remained at Pavia for the rest of her career where her scholarship, along with that of Cesare Segre, D'Arco Silvio Avalle, and Dante Isella, Corti's scholarship created the so-called \"Pavia school\" of philology and [[semiotics]]. At Pavia, she also established the ''Fondo Manoscritti di Autori Moderni e Contemporanei'', an extensive curated archive of autograph manuscripts and other documents by 19th- and 20th-century Italian writers. She founded and edited the journal ''Autografo'' which published scholarly work based on material in the archive, as well as two other journals ''[[Alfabeta]]'' and ''Strumenti critici''.<ref name = \"West\"/>\n\nCorti continued working up until the time of her death. The manuscript of her last work, ''Scritti su Cavalcanti e Dante'', was handed to her publisher in early February 2002.
