It served as a prison for [[prostitute]]s, and a holding place for women who were learning disabled, mentally ill or [[epileptic]], as well as poor; it was also notable for its population of rats and a bloated and unresponsive bureaucracy. Although the Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re was much admired for the architectural ambitions of [[Lib\u00e9ral Bruant]], it provided wretched living conditions for its inmates.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gonz\u00e1lez Velasco|first1=Pedro|title=La Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Hospital before Charcot|pmid=22704980|doi=10.1016/j.nrl.2012.03.017|volume=28|journal=Neurologia|pages=52\u20136|doi-access=free}}</ref> The building was enlarged in 1684.\n\nOn the eve of the [[French Revolution|Revolution]], it had become [[History of medicine in France|the world's largest hospital]], with a capacity of 10,000 patients plus 300 prisoners. From La Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re they were paired with convicts and forcibly expatriated to [[New France]].\n\nDuring the [[September massacres]] of 1792, the Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re was stormed on the night of 3/4 September by a mob from the impoverished working-class district of the Faubourg Saint-Marcel, with the avowed intention of releasing the detained prisoners: 134 of the [[prostitute]]s were released; twenty-five madwomen were less fortunate and were dragged, some still in their chains, into the streets and murdered.<ref>This episode is discussed in detail by [[Mary Bosworth]], \"Anatomy of a Massacre: Gender, Power, and Punishment in Revolutionary Paris\" ''Violence Against Women'', '''7'''.10, (2001:1101\u20131121).</ref>\n\n[[File:Gautier - Salpetriere.JPG|thumb|left|200px|1857 lithograph by [[Armand Gautier]], showing personifications of [[dementia]], [[megalomania]], [[acute mania]], [[melancholia]], [[idiocy]], [[hallucination]], [[erotomania]] and [[paralysis]] in the gardens of the Hospice de la Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re]]\n[[Image:Salpetriere Chapel.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Hospital chapel]]\nAt the very end of the 18th century, the early humanitarian reforms in the treatment of the mentally ill were initiated here by [[Philippe Pinel]] (1745\u20131826), friend of the ''[[Encyclop\u00e9die|Encyclop\u00e9distes]]''. The iconic image of Pinel as the liberator of the insane was created in 1876 by [[Tony Robert-Fleury]] and Pinel's sculptural monument stands before the main entrance in Place Marie-Curie, Boulevard de L'H\u00f4pital.

He was succeeded by his assistant [[Jean-\u00c9tienne Dominique Esquirol]] (1772\u20131840) who, from 1817, delivered the first systematic lectures on psychiatry in France and was the chief architect of the lunacy legislation of 30 June 1838. Esquirol was followed by [[\u00c9tienne Pariset]]; and from 1831 till 1867 the ''chef d'hospice'' was [[Jean-Pierre Falret]] (1794\u20131870) who contributed much to our understanding of [[bipolar disorder]] and [[folie \u00e0 deux]].\n\nA regular visitor to the Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re from 1842 till his death more than thirty years later was Guillaume-Benjamin [[Duchenne de Boulogne]] (1806\u20131875). From humble provincial origins, a long line of seafarers from Boulogne, Duchenne became one of the outstanding medical scientists of the nineteenth century. Though he never held a senior appointment in the hospital, Duchenne nevertheless made meticulous observations on neurological patients, employing a wide range of innovative diagnostic techniques. Duchenne's clinical science stood at the junction of electricity, photography and psychology, as recorded in his much admired ''De l'\u00e9lectrisation localis\u00e9e'' with its associated atlas ''Album de photographies pathologiques'' (1855, 1862). His name is commemorated in the [[Duchenne muscular dystrophy|myopathies]] which he described, as well as in his 1862 masterpiece, the ''[[M\u00e9canisme de la physionomie humaine]]'', much consulted by [[Charles Darwin]] in the preparation of his ''[[Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]'' (1872).<ref>Duchenne (de Boulogne), G.-B.

Definitive edition of Duchenne's masterpiece.</ref> Duchenne's last major work (published in 1867) was a study of the physiology of movement. He was never elected to the Academy of Sciences.\n\nLater, when [[Jean-Martin Charcot]] (1825\u20131893) took over the department, the Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re became celebrated as a neuropsychiatric teaching centre, represented on canvas in 1887 by ''[[A Clinical Lesson at the Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re]]'' by [[Andr\u00e9 Brouillet]]. In his lectures and demonstrations, the ''le\u00e7ons du mardi'', Charcot did much to map out the territory of modern clinical neurology and, in a personal enthusiasm, explored its interface with psychological distress as represented in [[hysteria]]. Although Charcot insisted that hysteria could be a male disorder (\"traumatic hysteria\"), he is popularly remembered for his demonstrations with [[Louise Augustine Gleizes]] and [[Marie \"Blanche\" Wittmann]], known as the Queen of Hysterics.<ref>Hustvedt, Asti (2011) ''Medical Muses: Hysteria in Nineteenth-Century Paris'' London, Berlin etc.: Bloomsbury Publishing.

London and New York: Tavistock/Routledge ''Tavistock Classics in the History of Psychiatry''.</ref> In his discussion of ''[[Parkinson's disease|paralysis agitans]]'', Charcot drew attention to the 1817 description by [[James Parkinson]], and suggested it be renamed [[Parkinson's disease]]. In 1882, with Charcot's encouragement, [[Albert Londe]] created a photographic department in the Salp\u00eatri\u0117re, producing, in collaboration with [[Georges Gilles de la Tourette]], the ''Nouvelle Iconographie de la Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re'' of 1888.<ref>Didi-Huberman, Georges (1982) ''The Invention of Hysteria: Charcot and the Photographic Iconography of the Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re'', translated (2003) by Alisa Hartz.

The first English translations of Charcot's ''Clinical Lectures'' (1877, 1881) were published by the Irish physician and statesman [[George Sigerson]]. Public health physician and advocate of breastfeeding [[Truby King]] travelled from New Zealand to witness Charcot, and reported his clinical demonstrations to be a life-changing experience. A rather negative portrait of Charcot's clinical style emerges in the 1929 autobiographical memoir \u2013 ''[[The Story of San Michele]]'' \u2013 by the Swedish physician [[Axel Munthe]], whose early idolatry of Charcot gave way to a kind of obsessive antagonism.\n\nThe H\u00f4pital de la Piti\u00e9, founded about 1612, was moved next to the Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re in 1911 and fused with it in 1964 to form the Groupe Hospitalier Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re.

It served as a prison for [[prostitute]]s, and a holding place for women who were learning disabled, mentally ill or [[epileptic]], as well as poor; it was also notable for its population of rats and a bloated and unresponsive bureaucracy. Although the Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re was much admired for the architectural ambitions of [[Lib\u00e9ral Bruant]], it provided wretched living conditions for its inmates.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gonz\u00e1lez Velasco|first1=Pedro|title=La Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Hospital before Charcot|pmid=22704980|doi=10.1016/j.nrl.2012.03.017|volume=28|journal=Neurologia|pages=52\u20136|doi-access=free}}</ref> The building was enlarged in 1684.\n\nOn the eve of the [[French Revolution|Revolution]], it had become [[History of medicine in France|the world's largest hospital]], with a capacity of 10,000 patients plus 300 prisoners.

He was succeeded by his assistant [[Jean-\u00c9tienne Dominique Esquirol]] (1772\u20131840) who, from 1817, delivered the first systematic lectures on psychiatry in France and was the chief architect of the lunacy legislation of 30 June 1838. Esquirol was followed by [[\u00c9tienne Pariset]]; and from 1831 till 1867 the ''chef d'hospice'' was [[Jean-Pierre Falret]] (1794\u20131870) who contributed much to our understanding of [[bipolar disorder]] and [[folie \u00e0 deux]].\n\nA regular visitor to the Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re from 1842 till his death more than thirty years later was Guillaume-Benjamin [[Duchenne de Boulogne]] (1806\u20131875). From humble provincial origins, a long line of seafarers from Boulogne, Duchenne became one of the outstanding medical scientists of the nineteenth century. Though he never held a senior appointment in the hospital, Duchenne nevertheless made meticulous observations on neurological patients, employing a wide range of innovative diagnostic techniques. Duchenne's clinical science stood at the junction of electricity, photography and psychology, as recorded in his much admired ''De l'\u00e9lectrisation localis\u00e9e'' with its associated atlas ''Album de photographies pathologiques'' (1855, 1862). His name is commemorated in the [[Duchenne muscular dystrophy|myopathies]] which he described, as well as in his 1862 masterpiece, the ''[[M\u00e9canisme de la physionomie humaine]]'', much consulted by [[Charles Darwin]] in the preparation of his ''[[Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]'' (1872).<ref>Duchenne (de Boulogne), G.-B.

Definitive edition of Duchenne's masterpiece.</ref> Duchenne's last major work (published in 1867) was a study of the physiology of movement. He was never elected to the Academy of Sciences.\n\nLater, when [[Jean-Martin Charcot]] (1825\u20131893) took over the department, the Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re became celebrated as a neuropsychiatric teaching centre, represented on canvas in 1887 by ''[[A Clinical Lesson at the Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re]]'' by [[Andr\u00e9 Brouillet]]. In his lectures and demonstrations, the ''le\u00e7ons du mardi'', Charcot did much to map out the territory of modern clinical neurology and, in a personal enthusiasm, explored its interface with psychological distress as represented in [[hysteria]]. Although Charcot insisted that hysteria could be a male disorder (\"traumatic hysteria\"), he is popularly remembered for his demonstrations with [[Louise Augustine Gleizes]] and [[Marie \"Blanche\" Wittmann]], known as the Queen of Hysterics.<ref>Hustvedt, Asti (2011) ''Medical Muses: Hysteria in Nineteenth-Century Paris'' London, Berlin etc.: Bloomsbury Publishing.

London and New York: Tavistock/Routledge ''Tavistock Classics in the History of Psychiatry''.</ref> In his discussion of ''[[Parkinson's disease|paralysis agitans]]'', Charcot drew attention to the 1817 description by [[James Parkinson]], and suggested it be renamed [[Parkinson's disease]]. In 1882, with Charcot's encouragement, [[Albert Londe]] created a photographic department in the Salp\u00eatri\u0117re, producing, in collaboration with [[Georges Gilles de la Tourette]], the ''Nouvelle Iconographie de la Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re'' of 1888.<ref>Didi-Huberman, Georges (1982) ''The Invention of Hysteria: Charcot and the Photographic Iconography of the Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re'', translated (2003) by Alisa Hartz.

The first English translations of Charcot's ''Clinical Lectures'' (1877, 1881) were published by the Irish physician and statesman [[George Sigerson]]. Public health physician and advocate of breastfeeding [[Truby King]] travelled from New Zealand to witness Charcot, and reported his clinical demonstrations to be a life-changing experience. A rather negative portrait of Charcot's clinical style emerges in the 1929 autobiographical memoir \u2013 ''[[The Story of San Michele]]'' \u2013 by the Swedish physician [[Axel Munthe]], whose early idolatry of Charcot gave way to a kind of obsessive antagonism.\n\nThe H\u00f4pital de la Piti\u00e9, founded about 1612, was moved next to the Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re in 1911 and fused with it in 1964 to form the Groupe Hospitalier Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re.

It determined the population of the [[United States]] to be 31,443,322, in 33 states and 10 organized territories. This was an increase of 35.4 percent over the 23,191,876 persons [[Enumeration|enumerated]] during the [[United States Census, 1850|1850 Census]]. The total population included 3,953,762 slaves.\n\nBy the time the 1860 census returns were ready for tabulation, the nation was sinking into the [[American Civil War]]. As a result, Census Superintendent [[Joseph C. G. Kennedy]] and his staff produced only an abbreviated set of public reports, without graphic or cartographic representations. The statistics did allow the Census staff to produce a cartographic display, including preparing maps of Southern states, for Union field commanders.  These maps displayed militarily vital topics, including the white population, slave population, predominant agricultural products (by county), and rail and [[post road]] transportation routes.\n\nThis census saw [[Philadelphia]] regain its position as a second-most populous American city, which it had lost to [[Baltimore]] in 1820, due to the [[Act of Consolidation, 1854]] merging many smaller surrounding townships, such as [[Spring Garden District, Pennsylvania|Spring Garden]], [[Northern Liberties Township, Pennsylvania|Northern Liberties]], and [[Kensington District, Pennsylvania|Kensington]], into the main city of Philadelphia. Philadelphia would in turn permanently lose the position to [[Chicago]] in 1890.\n\n==Census questions==\n\nThe 1860 census Schedule 1 (Free Inhabitants) was one of two schedules that counted the population of the United States; the other was Schedule 2 (Slave Inhabitants).  Schedule 1 collected the following information:<ref>{{cite web|title=1860 Census Questionnaire|url=https://www.census.gov/history/pdf/1860_questionnaire.pdf|publisher=US Census Bureau|accessdate=March 28, 2013}}</ref>\n\n{| border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable\"\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|'''Column'''\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|'''Title'''\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|'''Notes'''\n|-\n| 1||Dwelling-houses&nbsp;\u2013 numbered in the order of visitation.||\n|-\n| 2||Families numbered in the order of visitation||\n|-\n| 3||The name of every person whose usual place of abode on the first date of June 1860, was in this family.||\n|-\n| 4||Description: Age.||\n|-\n| 5||Description: Sex.||M or F\n|-\n| 6||Description: Color, (White, black, or mulatto).||W, B or M\n|-\n| 7||Profession, Occupation, or Trade of each person, male and female, over 15 years of age.||\n|-\n| 8||Value of Estate Owned: Value of Real Estate.||\n|-\n| 9||Value of Estate Owned: Value of Personal Estate.||\n|-\n| 10||Place of Birth, Naming the State, Territory, or Country.||\n|-\n| 11||Married within the year.||Marked with '/'\n|-\n| 12||Attended School within the year.||Marked with '/'\n|-\n| 13||Persons over 20 years of age who can not read and write.||Marked with '/'\n|-\n| 14||Whether deaf and dumb, blind, insane, idiotic, pauper, or convict.||\n|-\n|}\n\n==Data availability==\nFull documentation for the 1860 population census, including [[Microdata (statistics)|microdata]], census forms and enumerator instructions, is available from  the [[Integrated Public Use Microdata Series]] (IPUMS).  [[Aggregate data]] for small areas, together with compatible cartographic boundary files, can be downloaded from the [[National Historical Geographic Information System]].\n\n==Common occupations==\nNational data reveals that farmers (owners and tenants) made up nearly 10% of utilized occupations. Farm laborers (wage workers) represent the next highest percent with 3.2%, followed by general laborers at 3.0%.<ref>{{cite web|title=IPUMS 1860 Census Data|url=http://sda.usa.ipums.org|work=IPUMS Data Collection|accessdate=March 1, 2011}}</ref>\n\nMore localized data shows that other occupations were common. In the town of [[Essex, Massachusetts]], a large section of the women in the labor force were devoted to shoe-binding, while for men the common occupations were farming and shoe-making.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wilhelm|first=Kurt|title=Essex, MA Census 1860|url=http://essex.essexcountyma.net/census/1860.html|work=1860 Federal Census|accessdate=February 27, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723120353/http://essex.essexcountyma.net/census/1860.html|archive-date=July 23, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> This heavy demand of shoe-related labor reinforces the high demand for rigorous physical laborers in the economy, as supported by the data of very large amounts of farm related work as compared to most other labor options.\n\nIPUMS' data also notes that the share of the population that had been enrolled in school or marked as \"Student\" stood at 0.2%.  This demonstrates a small rate of growth, if any, in the proficiency of the [[human capital]] of the time\u2014the skill set a worker has to apply to the labor force, which can increase total output through increased efficiency.\n\nThe census of 1860 was the last in which much of Southern wealth was held as slaves\u2014still legally considered property. Analogous to today where wealth can fluctuate with value changes in stocks, factories, and other forms of property, the South suffered a huge loss of total wealth and assets when the [[American Civil War]] ended and slaves were no longer counted as physical property.\n\n==Population of US States and Territories==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ style=\"text-align: left\" | Population of the US States and Territories<ref>Data tabulated by {{cite web |title=1860 Census Results |url=http://www.civil-war.net/pages/1860_census.html |website=The Civil War Home Page |accessdate=7 October 2019}}</ref><ref>Population figures checked against {{cite web |title=1860 Census: Population of the United States |url=https://raogk.org/census-records/1860-census/ |website=Random Acts of Geneological Kindness |accessdate=7 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=1860 Census: Population of the United States |url=https://www.census.gov/library/publications/1864/dec/1860a.html |publisher=United States Census Bureau |accessdate=7 October 2019}} Used as a source for slavery figures for territories (which were not included in the original source.</ref>\n\n!

It determined the population of the [[United States]] to be 31,443,322, in 33 states and 10 organized territories. This was an increase of 35.4 percent over the 23,191,876 persons [[Enumeration|enumerated]] during the [[United States Census, 1850|1850 Census]]. The total population included 3,953,762 slaves.\n\nBy the time the 1860 census returns were ready for tabulation, the nation was sinking into the [[American Civil War]]. As a result, Census Superintendent [[Joseph C. G. Kennedy]] and his staff produced only an abbreviated set of public reports, without graphic or cartographic representations. The statistics did allow the Census staff to produce a cartographic display, including preparing maps of Southern states, for Union field commanders.  These maps displayed militarily vital topics, including the white population, slave population, predominant agricultural products (by county), and rail and [[post road]] transportation routes.\n\nThis census saw [[Philadelphia]] regain its position as a second-most populous American city, which it had lost to [[Baltimore]] in 1820, due to the [[Act of Consolidation, 1854]] merging many smaller surrounding townships, such as [[Spring Garden District, Pennsylvania|Spring Garden]], [[Northern Liberties Township, Pennsylvania|Northern Liberties]], and [[Kensington District, Pennsylvania|Kensington]], into the main city of Philadelphia. Philadelphia would in turn permanently lose the position to [[Chicago]] in 1890.\n\n==Census questions==\n\nThe 1860 census Schedule 1 (Free Inhabitants) was one of two schedules that counted the population of the United States; the other was Schedule 2 (Slave Inhabitants).  Schedule 1 collected the following information:<ref>{{cite web|title=1860 Census Questionnaire|url=https://www.census.gov/history/pdf/1860_questionnaire.pdf|publisher=US Census Bureau|accessdate=March 28, 2013}}</ref>\n\n{| border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable\"\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|'''Column'''\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|'''Title'''\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|'''Notes'''\n|-\n| 1||Dwelling-houses&nbsp;\u2013 numbered in the order of visitation.||\n|-\n| 2||Families numbered in the order of visitation||\n|-\n| 3||The name of every person whose usual place of abode on the first date of June 1860, was in this family.||\n|-\n| 4||Description: Age.||\n|-\n| 5||Description: Sex.||M or F\n|-\n| 6||Description: Color, (White, black, or mulatto).||W, B or M\n|-\n| 7||Profession, Occupation, or Trade of each person, male and female, over 15 years of age.||\n|-\n| 8||Value of Estate Owned: Value of Real Estate.||\n|-\n| 9||Value of Estate Owned: Value of Personal Estate.||\n|-\n| 10||Place of Birth, Naming the State, Territory, or Country.||\n|-\n| 11||Married within the year.||Marked with '/'\n|-\n| 12||Attended School within the year.||Marked with '/'\n|-\n| 13||Persons over 20 years of age who can not read and write.||Marked with '/'\n|-\n| 14||Whether deaf and dumb, blind, insane, idiotic, pauper, or convict.||\n|-\n|}\n\n==Data availability==\nFull documentation for the 1860 population census, including [[Microdata (statistics)|microdata]], census forms and enumerator instructions, is available from  the [[Integrated Public Use Microdata Series]] (IPUMS).  [[Aggregate data]] for small areas, together with compatible cartographic boundary files, can be downloaded from the [[National Historical Geographic Information System]].\n\n==Common occupations==\nNational data reveals that farmers (owners and tenants) made up nearly 10% of utilized occupations. Farm laborers (wage workers) represent the next highest percent with 3.2%, followed by general laborers at 3.0%.<ref>{{cite web|title=IPUMS 1860 Census Data|url=http://sda.usa.ipums.org|work=IPUMS Data Collection|accessdate=March 1, 2011}}</ref>\n\nMore localized data shows that other occupations were common. In the town of [[Essex, Massachusetts]], a large section of the women in the labor force were devoted to shoe-binding, while for men the common occupations were farming and shoe-making.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wilhelm|first=Kurt|title=Essex, MA Census 1860|url=http://essex.essexcountyma.net/census/1860.html|work=1860 Federal Census|accessdate=February 27, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723120353/http://essex.essexcountyma.net/census/1860.html|archive-date=July 23, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> This heavy demand of shoe-related labor reinforces the high demand for rigorous physical laborers in the economy, as supported by the data of very large amounts of farm related work as compared to most other labor options.\n\nIPUMS' data also notes that the share of the population that had been enrolled in school or marked as \"Student\" stood at 0.2%.  This demonstrates a small rate of growth, if any, in the proficiency of the [[human capital]] of the time\u2014the skill set a worker has to apply to the labor force, which can increase total output through increased efficiency.\n\nThe census of 1860 was the last in which much of Southern wealth was held as slaves\u2014still legally considered property. Analogous to today where wealth can fluctuate with value changes in stocks, factories, and other forms of property, the South suffered a huge loss of total wealth and assets when the [[American Civil War]] ended and slaves were no longer counted as physical property.\n\n==Population of US States and Territories==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ style=\"text-align: left\" | Population of the US States and Territories<ref>Data tabulated by {{cite web |title=1860 Census Results |url=http://www.civil-war.net/pages/1860_census.html |website=The Civil War Home Page |accessdate=7 October 2019}}</ref><ref>Population figures checked against {{cite web |title=1860 Census: Population of the United States |url=https://raogk.org/census-records/1860-census/ |website=Random Acts of Geneological Kindness |accessdate=7 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=1860 Census: Population of the United States |url=https://www.census.gov/library/publications/1864/dec/1860a.html |publisher=United States Census Bureau |accessdate=7 October 2019}} Used as a source for slavery figures for territories (which were not included in the original source.</ref>\n\n!

Al-Qawuqji supported the independence of the short-lived  [[Arab Kingdom of Syria]]. In 1920, he fought at the [[Battle of Maysalun]], serving in the army of [[Faisal I of Iraq|King Faisal]] as a captain (''ra'is khayyal'') in a squadron commanded by [[Taha al-Hashimi]].\n\nAfter the unsuccessful outcome of the campaign to establish the Arab Kingdom of Syria, [[Syria]] became a [[French Mandate of Syria|French Mandate]]. Al-Qawuqji then joined the 'Syrian Legion' (also known as the [[Army of the Levant|French-Syrian Army]]) which had been created by the French mandatory authorities.

This was probably al-Qawuqji's first encounter with a representative of Nazi Germany.<ref name=\"auto1\">H\u00f6pp, 1995, p. 3.</ref> In August, he commanded about 200 volunteers from Iraq, Syria, Transjordan, and the Samaria region of Palestine. His title was 'Supreme Commander of the Arab Revolution in South-Syrian Palestine.' He operated four units, (Iraqi, Syrian, [[Druze]] and Palestinian) in the [[Nablus]]\u2013[[Tulkaram]]\u2013[[Jenin]] triangle until the end of October. The military performance of al-Qawuqji's troops became hampered by internal dissensions and animosity between him and Grand Mufti Husseini, the [[Arab Higher Committee]], and the Mufti's kinsman [[Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni]], who commanded forces that were active in the area around Jerusalem.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> On 26 October 1936, al-Qawuqji crossed the Jordan River with his troops into Transjordan. A few weeks later he returned to Iraq.<ref name=\"auto2\">H\u00f6pp, 1995, p. 4.</ref>\n\nAlthough al-Qawuqji and Grand Mufti al-Husseini had periods of considerable friction and discord, particularly during the 1936\u201339 Arab revolt in Palestine,<ref name=\"auto2\" /> the two men subsequently reached a rapprochement. Al-Qawuqji followed the Mufti from Lebanon to Iraq in October 1939, along with other members of the Mufti's entourage, including [[Jamal al-Husayni]], [[Rafiq al-Tamimi]], and Sheikh [[Hasan Salama]]. Al-Qawuqji became the Mufti's military advisor in the 'Arab Committee' that Haj Amin Husseini formed in Baghdad. Husseini's group, including, al-Qawuqji, played critical roles in the pro-Axis coup.<ref>''Nazi Propaganda for the Arab World'' by Jeffrey Herf (Yale University Press, 2009) {{ISBN|978-0-300-14579-3}}. p, 37</ref>  His frequently demonstrated prowess won him fame among the Arab population and the esteem of Haj Amin Husseini.

Al-Qawuqji led approximately 500 \"irregulars\" in the area between Rutbah and Ramadi.<ref>Lyman, p. 88</ref> He established a reputation as bold fighter. He was also known to either execute or mutilate his prisoners.<ref name=\"Lyman\" /> After the Rashid Ali regime collapsed, al-Qawuqji and his irregular forces were targeted for destruction by the ''[[Mercol]]'' [[flying column]] and were chased out of Iraq. While still in Iraq, a British plane strafed and almost killed him.<ref name=Time />\n\n==World War II==\n\n===Berlin===\nAfter suffering serious wounds fighting the British in Iraq, al-Qawuqji was transported to [[Vichy France|Vichy French]]-held Syria, and then made his way to [[Nazi Germany]].<ref name=Lyman /><ref>Lyman, p. 87</ref>  He remained in Germany for the remainder of World War II, recuperated from his wounds, and married a German woman.<ref>Collins & Lapierre, pp. 159, 160</ref>\n\nAl-Qawuqji's sojourn in Germany has been the subject of considerable controversy.<ref>\"Palestinian Arab National Movement, 1929 - 1939: From Riots to Rebellion,\" by Yehoshua Porath, (London: Cass; 1977), pp. 236, 237</ref> [[Gilbert Achcar]] recounts stories of conflicts during his Berlin period:\n\n<blockquote> In his memoirs, he tells how, during his stay in hospital, he came under heavy pressure from German civilian and military officials to declare his allegiance to the f\u00fchrer. He even had an altercation with an SS officer who proffered threats when al-Qawuqji insisted that Germany first formally acknowledge the Arab's right to independence. The next day, his son died of poisoning. al-Qawuqji, convinced that the Nazis had murdered the young man, refused to take part in the funeral they organized.<ref name=\"Achcar, p. 92\">\"Achcar,\" p. 92</ref> </blockquote>\n\nDr. Achcar reports that al-Qawuqji was as bewildered by rivalries between competing Arab leaders (Grand Mufti Haj Amin al-Husseini and exiled Iraqi former Prime Minister Rashid Ali) as by the Axis foot-dragging over support for Arab nationalist goals. He opposed incorporating Arab units into the Axis armed forces, since he preferred their formation into an independent Arab nationalist army.<ref name=\"Achcar, p. 92\"/>\n\nIn May 1942, after the [[Axis powers]] signed secret documents to support the Arab nationalists, al-Qawuqji expressed dissatisfaction with the results, commenting that they were \"just symbolic and not an agreement.\"<ref>\"Nazi Palestine: The Plans for the Extermination of the Jews in Palestine.\" by Klaus-Michael Mallmann and Martin Cuppers, trans. by Krista Smith, (Enigma Books, published in association with the United States Holocaust Museum, NY; 2010), p. 92</ref>\n\n===German Military Service===\nHe was awarded the rank of a colonel of the [[Wehrmacht]] (German Army), and given a captain to act as his aide, along with a chauffeured car, and an apartment near the clinic at Hansa. His expenses were paid by Wehrmacht High Command and by Rashid Ali's Foreign Minister. The Germans used al-Qawuqji's name and reputation extensively in their propaganda.<ref>H\u00f6pp, 1995, p.16, \"Der Syrer, dem der Rang eines Obersten der Wehrmacht verliehen worden war' ', erfreute sich eines Adjutanten im Hauptmannsrang und eines Dienstwagens mit Chauffeur sowie einer Wohnung in der Cuxhavenerstra\u00dfe, nahe der Klinik am Hansaplatz; bezahlt wurde sein Aufenthalt aus einem Sonderfonds des Reichsau\u00dfenministers f\u00fcr al-Kaylani sowie durch das Oberkommando der Wehrmacht.'

In June 1941, [[Wehrmacht]] High [[F\u00fchrer Directive No. 30]] and the \"Instructions for [[Special Staff F]]\" (Sonderstab F) designated the Wehrmacht's central agency for all issues that affected the Arab world.  General der Flieger [[Hellmuth Felmy]], who was appointed central authority for all Arab affairs concerning the Wehrmacht under the terms of this \"Directive No. 30\", wrote about al-Qawuqji's 'active interest' and support of the military training of Arabs by the Nazis:\n\n<blockquote>Thus a number of the volunteers had already secretly contacted Fauzi Kaikyi, the Syrian army leader.

Walter Warlimont, Foreword by Generaloberst Franz Haider, Historical Division, Headquarters, United States Army, Europe, ''Foreign Military Studies Branch'', 1952, p.13, by Gen. Haider;</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn July 1941 al-Qawuqji wrote a memorandum addressed to General Felmy.<ref>Mallmann & Cuppers, p. 126</ref> This memorandum's subject was the need for German-Arab alliance in Iraq, and included discussions of geography, desert warfare, and combined propaganda efforts directed against Jews.<ref>Mallmann & Cuppers, p. 126, 127</ref>  Al-Qawuqji was officially transferred to Sonderstab F after he was fully recovered from the wounds he received fighting against the British in Iraq.<ref>Mallmann & Cuppers, p. 75</ref> Gen. Felmy's memoirs (written after the war when he was a prisoner of the allies and published by the US Army) mention the political conflicts between the 'chieftains' (Grand Mufti Husseini and former Iraqi Prime Minister Rashid Ali) among Arab receiving military training in Greece, and their consequent contact with al-Qawuqji.<ref name = \"Felmy & Warlimont\"/> He consistently campaigned for the formation of an independent Arab nationalist army that would fight as German allies, rather than incorporate Arabs under the German command structure. On 4 September 1941 al-Qawuqji told a comrade in Syria \"I will come with Arab and German troops to help you.\"<ref>Mallmann & Cuppers, p. 85, 92</ref>\n\nIn 1945, he was captured by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] forces, and reportedly held prisoner until February 1947.<ref name=Time/>\n\n==1948 Palestine War and Arab Liberation Army==\n{{Main article|1948 Palestine War|Arab Liberation Army}}\n\n===Arab League Field Commander===\nIn 1947 al-Qawuqji traveled to Egypt via France, and proclaimed that he was \"at the disposition of the Arab people should they call on [him] to take up arms again.\"<ref name=\"Collins & Lapierre, pp. 160, 161\">Collins & Lapierre, pp. 160, 161</ref> In August he threatened that, should the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]] vote go the wrong way, \"we will have to initiate total war.

This appointment was opposed by Haj Amin Husseini, who had appointed his own kinsman [[Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni]] as the commander of the [[Army of the Holy War]].<ref>Collins & Lapierre, pp. 156\u2013163</ref><ref name=\"Gelber\">''Palestine, 1948: War, Escape and the Emergence of the Palestinian Refugee Problem'', by Yoav Gelber, (Portland, OR: Sussex Academic Press; 2006), p. 46\u201348, 51\u201356.</ref> The execution of the 1948 Palestine War was marked by the personal, family, and political rivalry between al-Qawuqji (who fought mainly in northern Palestine) and al-Husayni, who fought mostly in the Jerusalem area.<ref>''One Palestine, Complete: Jews and Arabs Under the British Mandate'', by Tom Segev, (New York: Henry Holt and Co., LLC; 1999), p. 510</ref>\n\n===Return to Palestine===\nIn early March 1948, al-Qawuqji moved some of his forces from the [[Damascus]] area and crossed (unmolested by British troops) into Palestine over the [[Allenby Bridge]], leading hundreds of Arab and Bosnian volunteers<ref name=\"Gelber\" /> in a column of twenty-five trucks.<ref name=\"Collins & Lapierre, p. 206\">Collins & Lapierre, p. 206</ref> The British troops' inaction infuriated General Sir Gordon MacMillan, who stated that al-Qawudji should not be allowed \"to go openly rampaging over territory in which Britain considered herself a sovereign power.\" General MacMillan did not want to confront al-Qawudji's force, however, since he saw \"no point in getting a lot of British soldiers killed in that kind of operation.\"<ref name=\"Collins & Lapierre, p. 206\"/>\n\nInside [[Mandatory Palestine]] al-Qawuqji commanded a few thousand armed men who had infiltrated the area. They were grouped into several regiments concentrated in Galilee and around Nablus.<ref name=\"Collins & Lapierre, p. 207\">Collins & Lapierre, p. 207</ref> Al-Qawuqji told his troops that the purpose was \"ridding Palestine of the Zionist plague\".<ref name=\"morris2008p61\"/> According to Collins and LaPierre, he anticipated a short campaign, and announced: \n<blockquote>\"I have come to Palestine to stay and fight until Palestine is a free and united Arab country or until I am killed and buried here,\" ... His aim, he declared, borrowing the slogan that was becoming the leitmotiv of the Arab leadership, was \"to drive all the Jews into the sea.\"<ref name=\"Collins & Lapierre, p. 207\"/></blockquote>\n\n===Mishmar HaEmek===\n[[File:Kaukji-armored-car-1948.jpg|thumb|An [[Otter Light Reconnaissance Car|Otter]] armored car captured by the [[Haganah]] from the ALA (Arab Liberation Army- Kaukji's army) on 1948. The car still carries the ALA emblem, a dagger stabbing a Star of David.]]\nIn April 1948, the ALA mounted a major attack on the kibbutz [[Battle of Mishmar HaEmek|Mishmar HaEmek]] which sat near the strategic road that connected [[Haifa]] to [[Jenin]], and was surrounded by Arab villages.<ref>Morris,2008, pp. 133.</ref>  On 4 April al-Qawuqji initiated the first use of artillery during the war by directing his seven 75 and 105&nbsp;mm field guns to fire on the kibbutz for a 36-hour barrage. During this battle al-Qawuqji issued a number of announcements that were subsequently proven false. In the first 24-hours he announced victory, on 8 April he announced he had taken Mishmar HaEmek, and after the battle was lost he claimed the Jews had been assisted by non-Jewish Soviet troops and bombers. Copies of these mendacious telegrams are preserved in the Jordanian archives.<ref>\"The War for Palestine,\" by Eugene L. Rogan and Avi Shlaim, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; 2007), p. 111.</ref> The Haganah and [[Palmach]] counter-attacked and the ALA were routed. The battle was over by 16 April, and most of the Arabs in the area fled, disheartened by the defeat of the ALA or demoralized by the Jewish victory. The remaining minority were expelled from the surrounding Arab villages by Jewish forces.<ref>Morris, 2008, pp. 133--137.</ref>\n[[File:Qawuqji.jpg|thumb|Fawzi al-Quawuqji 24 May 1948]]\nIn July, al-Qawuqji launched a rolling offensive of counterattacks, focusing on [[Ilaniya]] (Sejera), a Jewish settlement deep in ALA territory. Although he deployed armored cars and a battery of 75&nbsp;mm artillery to support the ALA infantry, his troops suffered from lack of artillery ammunition and host of other deficiencies. The opposing [[Golani Brigade|Golani]] Twelfth Battalion withstood the attack, inflicting heavy losses on the ALA. The battle ended on 18 July, with the ALA losing the Arab village of Lubiya, which had been their main base in Central Eastern Galilee.<ref>Morris, 2008, p. 282</ref>\n\n===Operation Hiram===\nThe ALA established control of upper central [[Galilee]], from the [[Sakhnin]]\u2013Arabe\u2013[[Deir Hanna]] line through [[Majd al-Krum]] up to the Lebanese border until October 1948. On 22 October, the date of the third [[UN]] Security Council cease-fire order, the ALA attacked Sheikh Abd, a hilltop overlooking [[Kibbutz]] [[Manara, Israel|Manara]] and put the kibbutz under siege. \n\nAl-Qawudji told the UN observers that he demanded depopulation of nearby Kibbutz [[Yiftah]] forces, and a diminution of [[Haganah]] (Israeli) forces in Manara. The Haganah responded by demanding that ALA withdraw from its positions. Al-Qawuqji rejected these counter-demands. The Haganah then informed the United Nations that in view of al-Qawuqji's actions it did not feel encumbered by the UN's cease-fire order, and on 24 October launched [[Operation Hiram]]. Historian Benny Morris concludes that although the Israelis had planned for Operation Hiram, they might not have launched this campaign without the justification provided by al-Qawuqji's military provocations.<ref>Morris, 2008, p.339, \"al-Qawuqji supplied the justification for Operation Hiram, in which the IDF overran the north-central Galilee \u201cpocket\u201d and a strip of southern Lebanon... Operation Hiram had been long in the planning... on 6 October, at the IDF General Staff meeting, Carmel had pressed for [Hiram] authorization, But the Cabinet held back. The Arabs were shortly to give him his chance. Before dawn on 22 October, in defiance of the UN Security Council cease-fire order, ALA units stormed the IDF hilltop position of Sheikh Abd, just north of, and overlooking, Kibbutz Manara... (which) was imperiled... Ben-Gurion initially rejected Carmel\u2019s demand to launch a major counteroffensive. He was chary of antagonizing the United Nations so close on the heels of its cease-fire order... The kibbutz was now besieged, and the main south-north road through the Panhandle to Metulla was also under threat. During 24\u201325 October ALA troops regularly sniped at Manara and at traffic along the main road. In contacts with UN observers, al-Qawuqji demanded that Israel evacuate... The IDF demanded the ALA's withdrawal from the captured positions and, after a 'no' from al-Qawuqji, informed the United Nations that it felt free to do as it pleased. Sensing what was about to happen, the Lebanese army 'ordered' al-Qawuqji to withdraw from Israeli territory\u2014but to no avail. Al-Qawuqji\u2019s provocation at Sheikh Abd made little military sense... On 16 October, a week before the attack on Sheikh Abd, Carmel... had pressed Ben-Gurion to be allowed 'to begin in the Galilee.' Ben-Gurion had refused, but on 24\u201325 October he gave the green light\"</ref> The ALA were driven from their positions, and the Arab forces lost all of upper Galilee, even though this had been assigned to the Arabs by the UN Partition Plan. On 30 October the Israeli [[Carmeli Brigade]] retook Sheikh Abd from the ALA, who had abandoned the position. Shortly thereafter the last of the ALA forces were driven out of Galilee, and al-Qawuqji escaped to Lebanon.<ref>Morris, 2008, pp. 330-339; see especially p. 339: \"IDF Northern Front OC Moshe Carmel was later to write that al-Qawuqji\u2019s provocation had been like \"a match that ignited... [the] fire... in a dry, yellow field... but the fire quickly rose... [and] turned on him and he was unable to douse it. In truth... Operation Hiram had been long in the planning.\"</ref>\n\nAfter the end of the war, al-Qawuqji moved to Syria and lived in Damascus, [[Beirut]], and Tripoli.\n\n==Published works==\n* al-Qawuqji, Fauzi (1972): [https://web.archive.org/web/20110928202610/http://www.palestine-studies.org/enakba/Memoirs/ Memoirs of al-Qawuqji, Fauzi] in ''[[Journal of Palestine Studies]]''\n** [https://web.archive.org/web/20110718144320/http://www.palestine-studies.org/enakba/Memoirs/Al%20Qawuqji%2C%20Memoirs%201948_Pt%201.pdf \"Memoirs, 1948, Part I\" in 1, no. 4 (Sum. 72): 27-58.] (PDF)\n** [https://web.archive.org/web/20110718144415/http://www.palestine-studies.org/enakba/Memoirs/Al%20Qawuqji%2C%20Memoirs%201948_Pt%202.pdf \"Memoirs, 1948, Part II\" in 2, no. 1 (Aut. 72): 3-33.] (PDF)\n\n==See also==\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-4}}\n* [[Great Syrian Revolt]]\n* [[Ayyash Al-Haj]]\n* [[Ibrahim Hananu]]\n{{Col-4}}\n* [[Yusuf al-'Azma]]\n* [[Abd al-Rahman Shahbandar|Abd Al-Rahman Shahbandar]]\n* [[Sultan al-Atrash]]\n{{Col-4}}\n* [[Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon]]\n* [[Henri Gouraud (general)|Henri Gouraud]]\n* [[Syria]]\n{{Col-4}}\n* [[Adham Khanjar]]\n* [[Saleh Al-Ali]]\n* [[Hasan al-Kharrat]]\n{{Col-end}}\n<gallery>\nHananu, 1932.jpg|[[Ibrahim Hananu]]\nShahbandar11.jpg|[[Abd al-Rahman Shahbandar|Abd Al-Rahman Shahbandar]]\nAyash Alhaj 1.jpg|[[Ayyash Al-Haj]]\nSultan Pasha al-Atrash.jpg|[[Sultan al-Atrash]]\nSaleh al-Ali.jpg|[[Saleh Al-Ali]]\nHasan Kharrat cropped 1925.jpg|[[Hasan al-Kharrat]]\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n<div class=\"reflist4\" style=\"height: 220px; overflow: auto; padding: 3px\">\n{{reflist|group=nb}}\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"morris2008p61\">{{cite book|author=Benny Morris|title=1948: a history of the first Arab-Israeli war|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J5jtAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=13 July 2013|year=2008|publisher=Yale University Press|pages=61|quote=\" As early as mid-August 1947, Fawzi al-Qawuqji\u2014soon to be named the head of the Arab League\u2019s volunteer army in Palestine, the Arab Liberation Army (ALA)\u2014threatened that, should the vote go the wrong way, \u201cwe will have to initiate total war.

While still in Iraq, a British plane strafed and almost killed him.<ref name=Time />\n\n==World War II==\n\n===Berlin===\nAfter suffering serious wounds fighting the British in Iraq, al-Qawuqji was transported to [[Vichy France|Vichy French]]-held Syria, and then made his way to [[Nazi Germany]].<ref name=Lyman /><ref>Lyman, p. 87</ref>  He remained in Germany for the remainder of World War II, recuperated from his wounds, and married a German woman.<ref>Collins & Lapierre, pp. 159, 160</ref>\n\nAl-Qawuqji's sojourn in Germany has been the subject of considerable controversy.<ref>\"Palestinian Arab National Movement, 1929 - 1939: From Riots to Rebellion,\" by Yehoshua Porath, (London: Cass; 1977), pp. 236, 237</ref> [[Gilbert Achcar]] recounts stories of conflicts during his Berlin period:\n\n<blockquote> In his memoirs, he tells how, during his stay in hospital, he came under heavy pressure from German civilian and military officials to declare his allegiance to the f\u00fchrer. He even had an altercation with an SS officer who proffered threats when al-Qawuqji insisted that Germany first formally acknowledge the Arab's right to independence. The next day, his son died of poisoning. al-Qawuqji, convinced that the Nazis had murdered the young man, refused to take part in the funeral they organized.<ref name=\"Achcar, p. 92\">\"Achcar,\" p. 92</ref> </blockquote>\n\nDr. Achcar reports that al-Qawuqji was as bewildered by rivalries between competing Arab leaders (Grand Mufti Haj Amin al-Husseini and exiled Iraqi former Prime Minister Rashid Ali) as by the Axis foot-dragging over support for Arab nationalist goals. He opposed incorporating Arab units into the Axis armed forces, since he preferred their formation into an independent Arab nationalist army.<ref name=\"Achcar, p. 92\"/>\n\nIn May 1942, after the [[Axis powers]] signed secret documents to support the Arab nationalists, al-Qawuqji expressed dissatisfaction with the results, commenting that they were \"just symbolic and not an agreement.\"<ref>\"Nazi Palestine: The Plans for the Extermination of the Jews in Palestine.\" by Klaus-Michael Mallmann and Martin Cuppers, trans. by Krista Smith, (Enigma Books, published in association with the United States Holocaust Museum, NY; 2010), p. 92</ref>\n\n===German Military Service===\nHe was awarded the rank of a colonel of the [[Wehrmacht]] (German Army), and given a captain to act as his aide, along with a chauffeured car, and an apartment near the clinic at Hansa.

In June 1941, [[Wehrmacht]] High [[F\u00fchrer Directive No. 30]] and the \"Instructions for [[Special Staff F]]\" (Sonderstab F) designated the Wehrmacht's central agency for all issues that affected the Arab world.  General der Flieger [[Hellmuth Felmy]], who was appointed central authority for all Arab affairs concerning the Wehrmacht under the terms of this \"Directive No. 30\", wrote about al-Qawuqji's 'active interest' and support of the military training of Arabs by the Nazis:\n\n<blockquote>Thus a number of the volunteers had already secretly contacted Fauzi Kaikyi, the Syrian army leader.

During this battle al-Qawuqji issued a number of announcements that were subsequently proven false. In the first 24-hours he announced victory, on 8 April he announced he had taken Mishmar HaEmek, and after the battle was lost he claimed the Jews had been assisted by non-Jewish Soviet troops and bombers. Copies of these mendacious telegrams are preserved in the Jordanian archives.<ref>\"The War for Palestine,\" by Eugene L.

Although he deployed armored cars and a battery of 75&nbsp;mm artillery to support the ALA infantry, his troops suffered from lack of artillery ammunition and host of other deficiencies. The opposing [[Golani Brigade|Golani]] Twelfth Battalion withstood the attack, inflicting heavy losses on the ALA. The battle ended on 18 July, with the ALA losing the Arab village of Lubiya, which had been their main base in Central Eastern Galilee.<ref>Morris, 2008, p. 282</ref>\n\n===Operation Hiram===\nThe ALA established control of upper central [[Galilee]], from the [[Sakhnin]]\u2013Arabe\u2013[[Deir Hanna]] line through [[Majd al-Krum]] up to the Lebanese border until October 1948. On 22 October, the date of the third [[UN]] Security Council cease-fire order, the ALA attacked Sheikh Abd, a hilltop overlooking [[Kibbutz]] [[Manara, Israel|Manara]] and put the kibbutz under siege. \n\nAl-Qawudji told the UN observers that he demanded depopulation of nearby Kibbutz [[Yiftah]] forces, and a diminution of [[Haganah]] (Israeli) forces in Manara. The Haganah responded by demanding that ALA withdraw from its positions. Al-Qawuqji rejected these counter-demands. The Haganah then informed the United Nations that in view of al-Qawuqji's actions it did not feel encumbered by the UN's cease-fire order, and on 24 October launched [[Operation Hiram]]. Historian Benny Morris concludes that although the Israelis had planned for Operation Hiram, they might not have launched this campaign without the justification provided by al-Qawuqji's military provocations.<ref>Morris, 2008, p.339, \"al-Qawuqji supplied the justification for Operation Hiram, in which the IDF overran the north-central Galilee \u201cpocket\u201d and a strip of southern Lebanon... Operation Hiram had been long in the planning... on 6 October, at the IDF General Staff meeting, Carmel had pressed for [Hiram] authorization, But the Cabinet held back. The Arabs were shortly to give him his chance. Before dawn on 22 October, in defiance of the UN Security Council cease-fire order, ALA units stormed the IDF hilltop position of Sheikh Abd, just north of, and overlooking, Kibbutz Manara... (which) was imperiled... Ben-Gurion initially rejected Carmel\u2019s demand to launch a major counteroffensive. He was chary of antagonizing the United Nations so close on the heels of its cease-fire order... The kibbutz was now besieged, and the main south-north road through the Panhandle to Metulla was also under threat. During 24\u201325 October ALA troops regularly sniped at Manara and at traffic along the main road. In contacts with UN observers, al-Qawuqji demanded that Israel evacuate... The IDF demanded the ALA's withdrawal from the captured positions and, after a 'no' from al-Qawuqji, informed the United Nations that it felt free to do as it pleased. Sensing what was about to happen, the Lebanese army 'ordered' al-Qawuqji to withdraw from Israeli territory\u2014but to no avail. Al-Qawuqji\u2019s provocation at Sheikh Abd made little military sense... On 16 October, a week before the attack on Sheikh Abd, Carmel... had pressed Ben-Gurion to be allowed 'to begin in the Galilee.' Ben-Gurion had refused, but on 24\u201325 October he gave the green light\"</ref> The ALA were driven from their positions, and the Arab forces lost all of upper Galilee, even though this had been assigned to the Arabs by the UN Partition Plan. On 30 October the Israeli [[Carmeli Brigade]] retook Sheikh Abd from the ALA, who had abandoned the position. Shortly thereafter the last of the ALA forces were driven out of Galilee, and al-Qawuqji escaped to Lebanon.<ref>Morris, 2008, pp. 330-339; see especially p. 339: \"IDF Northern Front OC Moshe Carmel was later to write that al-Qawuqji\u2019s provocation had been like \"a match that ignited... [the] fire... in a dry, yellow field... but the fire quickly rose... [and] turned on him and he was unable to douse it. In truth... Operation Hiram had been long in the planning.\"</ref>\n\nAfter the end of the war, al-Qawuqji moved to Syria and lived in Damascus, [[Beirut]], and Tripoli.\n\n==Published works==\n* al-Qawuqji, Fauzi (1972): [https://web.archive.org/web/20110928202610/http://www.palestine-studies.org/enakba/Memoirs/ Memoirs of al-Qawuqji, Fauzi] in ''[[Journal of Palestine Studies]]''\n** [https://web.archive.org/web/20110718144320/http://www.palestine-studies.org/enakba/Memoirs/Al%20Qawuqji%2C%20Memoirs%201948_Pt%201.pdf \"Memoirs, 1948, Part I\" in 1, no. 4 (Sum. 72): 27-58.] (PDF)\n** [https://web.archive.org/web/20110718144415/http://www.palestine-studies.org/enakba/Memoirs/Al%20Qawuqji%2C%20Memoirs%201948_Pt%202.pdf \"Memoirs, 1948, Part II\" in 2, no. 1 (Aut. 72): 3-33.] (PDF)\n\n==See also==\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-4}}\n* [[Great Syrian Revolt]]\n* [[Ayyash Al-Haj]]\n* [[Ibrahim Hananu]]\n{{Col-4}}\n* [[Yusuf al-'Azma]]\n* [[Abd al-Rahman Shahbandar|Abd Al-Rahman Shahbandar]]\n* [[Sultan al-Atrash]]\n{{Col-4}}\n* [[Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon]]\n* [[Henri Gouraud (general)|Henri Gouraud]]\n* [[Syria]]\n{{Col-4}}\n* [[Adham Khanjar]]\n* [[Saleh Al-Ali]]\n* [[Hasan al-Kharrat]]\n{{Col-end}}\n<gallery>\nHananu, 1932.jpg|[[Ibrahim Hananu]]\nShahbandar11.jpg|[[Abd al-Rahman Shahbandar|Abd Al-Rahman Shahbandar]]\nAyash Alhaj 1.jpg|[[Ayyash Al-Haj]]\nSultan Pasha al-Atrash.jpg|[[Sultan al-Atrash]]\nSaleh al-Ali.jpg|[[Saleh Al-Ali]]\nHasan Kharrat cropped 1925.jpg|[[Hasan al-Kharrat]]\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n<div class=\"reflist4\" style=\"height: 220px; overflow: auto; padding: 3px\">\n{{reflist|group=nb}}\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"morris2008p61\">{{cite book|author=Benny Morris|title=1948: a history of the first Arab-Israeli war|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J5jtAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=13 July 2013|year=2008|publisher=Yale University Press|pages=61|quote=\" As early as mid-August 1947, Fawzi al-Qawuqji\u2014soon to be named the head of the Arab League\u2019s volunteer army in Palestine, the Arab Liberation Army (ALA)\u2014threatened that, should the vote go the wrong way, \u201cwe will have to initiate total war.

He collaborated closely with his older brother [[Rodolfo Irazusta]] throughout his career.\n\n==Early years==\nIrazusta was born close to the Rincon del Cura area of [[Gualeguaych\u00fa, Entre R\u00edos]] into a family noted for its support of [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] politics.<ref name=\"Rees\"/> He attended the [[University of Buenos Aires]] - graduating in 1922 with a law degree - and around this time he was noted as a supporter of the [[Radical Civic Union]].<ref name=\"Rees\"/> As a student he edited the literary journal ''Revista Nacional'' from 1981 to 1920, collaborating with [[Ernesto Palacio (writer)|Ernesto Palacio]], who at the time held leftist views.<ref name=\"Rees\"/> Both men came under the influence of the Spanish rightist [[Ramiro de Maeztu]] although Irazusta balanced this by also following the writings of [[Italy|Italian]] [[liberalism|liberal]] [[Benedetto Croce]].<ref name=\"Rees\">[[Philip Rees]], ''[[Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890]]'', Simon & Schuster, 1990, p. 195</ref>\n\n==Move to the right==\nFrom 1923 to 1927 Irazusta travelled extensively in western [[Europe]]. During his time in the [[United Kingdom]] he studied Latin and philosophy at [[Balliol College, Oxford]].<ref name=\"Rees\"/> He also spent time in [[France]] where his move towards right-wing politics grew rapidly. Whilst here he met ''[[Action Fran\u00e7aise]]'' leader [[Charles Maurras]] and became attracted to the brand of [[integral nationalism]] that Maurras endorsed.<ref name=\"Rees\"/> His last major port of call in Europe was [[Italy]] where he observed [[fascism]] first hand and was attracted by the ideology.<ref name=\"Rees\"/> On his return to Argentina he resumed his association with Palacio, who was himself on the [[far right]] by that point, with the pair collaborating on the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] journal ''Criterio'' along with [[Jorge Luis Borges]], who only contributed some apolitical poems and did not share their politics, withdrawing from the journal once their support for fascism and Uriburu's coup became more evident.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Louis |first1=Annick |title=Borges ante el fascismo |date=2007 |publisher=Peter Lang |pages=83\u201384}}</ref><ref name=\"Rees\"/> Irazusta criticised democracy and was especially opposed to freedom of religion, arguing that it was part of an [[anti-Catholic]] conspiracy designed to promote [[Protestantism]].<ref>F. Finchelstein, ''The Ideological Origins of the Dirty War: Fascism, Populism, and Dictatorship in Twentieth Century Argentina'', Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 22</ref> Such was his opposition to [[socialism]] that he argued a civil war would be preferable to a left-wing government in Argentina.<ref>Finchelstein, ''The Ideological Origins of the Dirty War'', p. 23</ref>\n\nIn 1929 he joined his brother, Palacio and [[Juan Carulla]] in establishing the ''[[Republican League (Argentina)|Liga Republicana]]'', a group that sought the establishment of an authoritarian conservative regime under the leadership of military strongman General [[Jos\u00e9 F\u00e9lix Uriburu]].<ref name=\"Rees\"/> For his part however Irazusta was less enthusiastic about Uriburu than his fellow leaders and he left Argentina in 1930 to return to Europe, missing Uriburu's coup later that same year.<ref name=\"Rees\"/>\n\n==Irazusta brothers==\nUpon his return to Argentina in 1931 Julio Irazusta worked closely with his brother Rodolfo as the two sought to develop an Argentine native form of [[fascism]].<ref name=\"Rees\"/> They worked together closely on the journal ''Accion Republicana'' and in this developed a strong [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] line in which they argued against foreign economic involvement in Argentina and the [[liberalism]] that they believed this engendered.<ref name=\"Rees\"/> They came to endorse [[etatism]] and a strong governmental role in economic, political and cultural life, advocating some [[nationalisation]], economic modernisation and in increasing emphasis on militarism in the education system.<ref name=\"Rees\"/> They also contributed widely to LNR was well as the journal ''Voz del Pueblo'' which was pro-[[Nazism|Nazi]] in outlook.<ref>Bryce Wood, ''The dismantling of the good neighbor policy'', 1985, p. 220</ref> He was an admirer of [[Adolf Hitler]], describing him as \"an eminently sensible man, the complete opposite of the intolerant and presumptuous megalomaniac that his detractors paint him as\".<ref>Finchelstein, ''The Ideological Origins of the Dirty War'', p. 37</ref>\n\nThe brothers best known work was their 1934 book ''Argentina y el imperialismo brit\u00e1nico: Los eslabones de una cadena 1806-1833'' which accused the [[United Kingdom]], which had supported Argentina in its attempts to gain independence from [[Spain]], of doing so for ulterior motives i.e. opening up new trade markets and ensuring that the newly independent state would have to rely on them for loans.

He collaborated closely with his older brother [[Rodolfo Irazusta]] throughout his career.\n\n==Early years==\nIrazusta was born close to the Rincon del Cura area of [[Gualeguaych\u00fa, Entre R\u00edos]] into a family noted for its support of [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] politics.<ref name=\"Rees\"/> He attended the [[University of Buenos Aires]] - graduating in 1922 with a law degree - and around this time he was noted as a supporter of the [[Radical Civic Union]].<ref name=\"Rees\"/> As a student he edited the literary journal ''Revista Nacional'' from 1981 to 1920, collaborating with [[Ernesto Palacio (writer)|Ernesto Palacio]], who at the time held leftist views.<ref name=\"Rees\"/> Both men came under the influence of the Spanish rightist [[Ramiro de Maeztu]] although Irazusta balanced this by also following the writings of [[Italy|Italian]] [[liberalism|liberal]] [[Benedetto Croce]].<ref name=\"Rees\">[[Philip Rees]], ''[[Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890]]'', Simon & Schuster, 1990, p. 195</ref>\n\n==Move to the right==\nFrom 1923 to 1927 Irazusta travelled extensively in western [[Europe]].

Started two [[partridge]]s of a beautiful stone\u2212colour, so much like the rocks, that they could only be distinguished when in  motion. Heard the notes of a solitary bird in the cane\u2212brake, which we could not identify. The statement that nothing can live upon the shores of the sea, is, therefore, disproved. The home  and the usual haunt of the partridge may be among the cliffs above, but the smaller bird we heard must have its nest in the thicket.\"<ref>Lynch, 1849, pp. [https://archive.org/details/narrativeunited03lyncgoog/page/n324/mode/1up 274\u2212275]</ref>\n\nIn 1851 [[Louis F\u00e9licien de Saulcy|de Saulcy]] noted extensive ruins north of the spring.<ref>Saulcy, 1854, vol 1, p.

Water, vegetation, birds and beasts, geology, and hot baths \u2212everything was in abundance. The poor fountain has had, methinks, rather scurvy treatment at the hands of its biographers. [...] Perhaps our tastes were vitiated, or perhaps after the recent rains the mineral element was unusually diluted; but though the spring itself had  a temperature of 82\u00b0 [[Fahrenheit|Fahr.]] we found it tolerable. It made good tea and coffee, though with a slight flavour of soda, and we had no hesitation in determining to spend two days by its reeds.\"<ref>Tristram, 1865, p.

He also saw the \"foundations of a small square tower and of other small buildings\" near the fountain. He further noted a couple of ravens and a small hawk, and his guides killed a large (3 feet, 8 inches) lizard of the [[Lacerta  Nilotica]] species.<ref>Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol. 2, pp. [https://archive.org/details/biblicalresearc00smitgoog/page/n272/mode/1up 250], [https://archive.org/details/biblicalresearc00smitgoog/page/n274/mode/1up 252\u2013253]</ref>\n\nIn 1847 [[William F. Lynch]] visited the place, and described the stream as: \"The fountain is a shallow and clear stream of water, at the temperature of 84\u00b0, which flows from a [[cane\u2212brake]], near the base of the mountain. It is soft yet brackish, and there is no deposit of silicious or cretaceous matter, but it has a strong smell of sulphur.\"<ref>Lynch, 1849, p. [https://archive.org/details/narrativeunited03lyncgoog/page/n323/mode/1up 273]\n</ref> He further \"made an excursion along the base of the mountain, towards ''Ras es Feshkhah'' (cape of the stride), and gathered some specimens of conglomerate and some fresh\u2212water shells in the bed of the stream. We were struck with the almost absence of round stones and pebbles upon the beach \u2212the shore is covered with small angular fragments of flint. Started two [[partridge]]s of a beautiful stone\u2212colour, so much like the rocks, that they could only be distinguished when in  motion. Heard the notes of a solitary bird in the cane\u2212brake, which we could not identify. The statement that nothing can live upon the shores of the sea, is, therefore, disproved. The home  and the usual haunt of the partridge may be among the cliffs above, but the smaller bird we heard must have its nest in the thicket.\"<ref>Lynch, 1849, pp. [https://archive.org/details/narrativeunited03lyncgoog/page/n324/mode/1up 274\u2212275]</ref>\n\nIn 1851 [[Louis F\u00e9licien de Saulcy|de Saulcy]] noted extensive ruins north of the spring.<ref>Saulcy, 1854, vol 1, p.

Water, vegetation, birds and beasts, geology, and hot baths \u2212everything was in abundance. The poor fountain has had, methinks, rather scurvy treatment at the hands of its biographers. [...] Perhaps our tastes were vitiated, or perhaps after the recent rains the mineral element was unusually diluted; but though the spring itself had  a temperature of 82\u00b0 [[Fahrenheit|Fahr.]] we found it tolerable. It made good tea and coffee, though with a slight flavour of soda, and we had no hesitation in determining to spend two days by its reeds.\"<ref>Tristram, 1865, p.

The largest of these is 'Ain Feshkhah, near which is the little spring called 'Ain et Tannur. The water comes out from beneath the cliffs into a pool surrounded with canes, and runs over a shingly bed in several streams into the Dead Sea. The supply is copious and perennial, but has a slightly brackish taste and sulphurous smell.

Hirschfeld excavated the site in 2001. The earliest structure at the site, located south of the spring, was an Iron Age II fort,{{dubious|IAI = 1000-586 BC. Four centuries.

In ancient times a spring, now dried up, just north of the main building supplied water. This ancient spring being several meters higher suggests that it was sweet, not brackish.<ref>Magness 2002, p.214.</ref> The complex is composed of a main building (24m by 18m) with central courtyard, an industrial installation with two plastered basins to its northeast and what appear to be stables to its west.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nDe Vaux showed that the Ein Feshkha complex was contemporary with the settlement at Qumran and theorized that they were inhabited by the same community and, while he dated traces to the period from 100 to 31 BCE, both [[Jodi Magness|Magness]] and [[Yizhar Hirschfeld|Hirschfeld]] have concluded that the complex was Herodian, i.e. after 37 BCE.<ref>Taylor, 2006.</ref> The entrance was through two doors, side-by-side, to the east. There is a staircase in the southeast corner of the building, showing that there was an upper story.<ref>Magness 2002, p.211.</ref> A channel brings water from the spring through the wall to the north into a small rectangular tank on to each of the two basins.

Its mission was to eavesdrop on the radio traffic of Chinese army and air force units in southern China, especially in and around the city of [[Kunming]] in Yunnan Province. Back in the late 1970s the base consisted only of a small CDAA antenna array that was remote-controlled via satellite from the NSA listening post at [[Kunia, Hawaii]], and a small force of civilian contractors from Bendix Field Engineering Corp. whose job it was to keep the antenna array and satellite relay facilities up and running 24/7.<ref name=MattAid />\n\nAccording to the papers of the late General William Odom, the INDRA facility was upgraded in 1986 with a new British-made PUSHER CDAA antenna as part of an overall upgrade of NSA and Thai SIGINT facilities whose objective was to spy on the neighboring communist nations of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.<ref name=MattAid />\n\nThe base apparently fell into disrepair in the 1990s as China and Vietnam became more friendly towards the US, and by 2002 archived satellite imagery showed that the PUSHER CDAA antenna had been torn down, perhaps indicating that the base had been closed. At some point in the period since [[9/11]], the Khon Kaen base was reactivated and expanded to include a sizeable SATCOM intercept mission. It is likely that the NSA presence at Khon Kaen is relatively small, and that most of the work is done by civilian contractors.<ref name=MattAid />\n\n== Research and development ==\nNSA has been involved in debates about public policy, both indirectly as a behind-the-scenes adviser to other departments, and directly during and after [[Bobby Ray Inman|Vice Admiral Bobby Ray Inman]]'s directorship. NSA was a major player in the debates of the 1990s regarding the [[export of cryptography in the United States]]. Restrictions on export were reduced but not eliminated in 1996.\n\nIts secure government communications work has involved the NSA in numerous technology areas, including the design of specialized communications [[computer hardware|hardware]] and software, production of dedicated [[semiconductor]]s (at the [[Fort Meade, Maryland|Ft. Meade]] chip fabrication plant), and advanced [[cryptography]] research. For 50 years, NSA designed and built most of its computer equipment in-house, but from the 1990s until about 2003 (when the U.S. Congress curtailed the practice), the agency contracted with the private sector in the fields of research and equipment.<ref>{{cite news|title=Congress curbs NSA's power to contract with suppliers|author=Sabar, Ariel|date=July 20, 2013|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2003-07-20/news/0307200276_1_nsa-eavesdropping-agency|work=Baltimore Sun|publisher=Tribune Company|accessdate=June 17, 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Data Encryption Standard ===\n{{Main|Data Encryption Standard}}\n[[File:Frostburg.jpg|thumb|[[FROSTBURG]] was the NSA's first [[supercomputer]], used from 1991 to 1997]]\n\nNSA was embroiled in some minor controversy concerning its involvement in the creation of the Data Encryption Standard (DES), a standard and public [[block cipher]] [[algorithm]] used by the [[U.S. government]] and banking community. During the development of DES by [[IBM]] in the 1970s, NSA recommended changes to some details of the design. There was suspicion that these changes had weakened the algorithm sufficiently to enable the agency to eavesdrop if required, including speculation that a critical component\u2014the so-called [[S-box]]es\u2014had been altered to insert a \"[[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor]]\" and that the reduction in key length might have made it feasible for NSA to discover DES keys using massive computing power.

An attack for SHA-0 that does not apply to the revised algorithm was indeed found between 1998 and 2005 by academic cryptographers.

Its mission was to eavesdrop on the radio traffic of Chinese army and air force units in southern China, especially in and around the city of [[Kunming]] in Yunnan Province. Back in the late 1970s the base consisted only of a small CDAA antenna array that was remote-controlled via satellite from the NSA listening post at [[Kunia, Hawaii]], and a small force of civilian contractors from Bendix Field Engineering Corp. whose job it was to keep the antenna array and satellite relay facilities up and running 24/7.<ref name=MattAid />\n\nAccording to the papers of the late General William Odom, the INDRA facility was upgraded in 1986 with a new British-made PUSHER CDAA antenna as part of an overall upgrade of NSA and Thai SIGINT facilities whose objective was to spy on the neighboring communist nations of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.<ref name=MattAid />\n\nThe base apparently fell into disrepair in the 1990s as China and Vietnam became more friendly towards the US, and by 2002 archived satellite imagery showed that the PUSHER CDAA antenna had been torn down, perhaps indicating that the base had been closed. At some point in the period since [[9/11]], the Khon Kaen base was reactivated and expanded to include a sizeable SATCOM intercept mission. It is likely that the NSA presence at Khon Kaen is relatively small, and that most of the work is done by civilian contractors.<ref name=MattAid />\n\n== Research and development ==\nNSA has been involved in debates about public policy, both indirectly as a behind-the-scenes adviser to other departments, and directly during and after [[Bobby Ray Inman|Vice Admiral Bobby Ray Inman]]'s directorship. NSA was a major player in the debates of the 1990s regarding the [[export of cryptography in the United States]]. Restrictions on export were reduced but not eliminated in 1996.\n\nIts secure government communications work has involved the NSA in numerous technology areas, including the design of specialized communications [[computer hardware|hardware]] and software, production of dedicated [[semiconductor]]s (at the [[Fort Meade, Maryland|Ft. Meade]] chip fabrication plant), and advanced [[cryptography]] research. For 50 years, NSA designed and built most of its computer equipment in-house, but from the 1990s until about 2003 (when the U.S. Congress curtailed the practice), the agency contracted with the private sector in the fields of research and equipment.<ref>{{cite news|title=Congress curbs NSA's power to contract with suppliers|author=Sabar, Ariel|date=July 20, 2013|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2003-07-20/news/0307200276_1_nsa-eavesdropping-agency|work=Baltimore Sun|publisher=Tribune Company|accessdate=June 17, 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Data Encryption Standard ===\n{{Main|Data Encryption Standard}}\n[[File:Frostburg.jpg|thumb|[[FROSTBURG]] was the NSA's first [[supercomputer]], used from 1991 to 1997]]\n\nNSA was embroiled in some minor controversy concerning its involvement in the creation of the Data Encryption Standard (DES), a standard and public [[block cipher]] [[algorithm]] used by the [[U.S. government]] and banking community. During the development of DES by [[IBM]] in the 1970s, NSA recommended changes to some details of the design. There was suspicion that these changes had weakened the algorithm sufficiently to enable the agency to eavesdrop if required, including speculation that a critical component\u2014the so-called [[S-box]]es\u2014had been altered to insert a \"[[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor]]\" and that the reduction in key length might have made it feasible for NSA to discover DES keys using massive computing power. It has since been observed that the S-boxes in DES are particularly resilient against [[differential cryptanalysis]], a technique which was not publicly discovered until the late 1980s but known to the IBM DES team.\n\n=== Advanced Encryption Standard ===\n{{Main|Advanced Encryption Standard}}\nThe involvement of NSA in selecting a successor to Data Encryption Standard (DES), the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), was limited to hardware performance testing (see [[Advanced Encryption Standard process|AES competition]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=Hardware Performance Simulations of Round 2 Advanced Encryption Standard Algorithms|author=Weeks, Bryan|url=http://csrc.nist.gov/archive/aes/round2/NSA-AESfinalreport.pdf|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology|accessdate=June 29, 2013|display-authors=etal|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111024234406/http://csrc.nist.gov/archive/aes/round2/NSA-AESfinalreport.pdf|archive-date=2011-10-24|url-status=dead}}</ref> NSA has subsequently certified AES for protection of classified information when used in NSA-approved systems.<ref name=\"suiteB\">\"the NIST standards that define Suite B...\" in {{cite web|title=Suite B Cryptography / Cryptographic Interoperability|url=https://www.nsa.gov/ia/programs/suiteb_cryptography/|publisher=National Security Agency|accessdate=June 29, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101091229/https://www.nsa.gov/ia/programs/suiteb_cryptography/|archive-date=2016-01-01|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== NSA encryption systems ===\n[[File:STU-IIIphones.nsa.jpg|thumb|[[STU-III]] secure telephones on display at the [[National Cryptologic Museum]]]]\n{{Main|NSA encryption systems}}\n\nThe NSA is responsible for the encryption-related components in these legacy systems:\n* [[FNBDT]] Future Narrow Band Digital Terminal<ref>{{cite book|title=C4ISR for Future Naval Strike Groups|author=Committee on C4ISR for Future Naval Strike Groups, National Research Council|isbn=978-0-309-09600-3|publisher=National Academies Press |year=2006|page=167 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NByKhCK3edkC&pg=PA167&lpg=PA167}}</ref>\n* [[KL-7]] ADONIS off-line rotor encryption machine (post-WWII \u2013 1980s)<ref>\"Adkins Family asked for a pic of the KL-7.

Bush]], the National Security Agency, in an attempt to thwart terrorism, had been tapping phone calls made to persons outside the country, without obtaining [[warrant (law)|warrants]] from the [[United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]], a secret court created for that purpose under the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]] (FISA).<ref name=\"NYTWarrantless\">[[James Risen]] & [[Eric Lichtblau]] (December 16, 2005), [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/16/politics/16program.html Bush Lets U.S. Spy on Callers Without Courts], ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref>\n\nOne such surveillance program, authorized by the U.S. Signals Intelligence Directive 18 of President George Bush, was the Highlander Project undertaken for the National Security Agency by the U.S. Army 513th Military Intelligence Brigade. NSA relayed telephone (including cell phone) conversations obtained from ground, airborne, and satellite monitoring stations to various U.S. Army Signal Intelligence Officers, including the 201st Military Intelligence Battalion.

In addition, some argued that FISA was implicitly overridden by a subsequent statute, the [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists|Authorization for Use of Military Force]], although the Supreme Court's ruling in ''[[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]]'' deprecates this view. In the August 2006 case ''[[ACLU v.
