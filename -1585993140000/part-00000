It is named after former secretary of the Cape Colony 1843-1853, [[John Montagu (colonial secretary)|John Montagu]], but was once known as Agter Cogman\u2019s Kloof, Cogman\u2019s Kloof linking the town of Montagu with the railway station in Ashton which is known for the Langeberg Canning Factory.. He was a very able administrator and a man with vision who realized that the colony would not make significant progress without proper means of communication. Shortly after his appointment as colonial secretary he therefore initiated a road-building programme which left mark on the landscape, the economy and the social life of the colony. John Montagu was born in 1797- probably in India- where his father served in the British army. At the age of 17 he joined the army himself and served in the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. His military career blossomed and he married Jessy Worsely in 1823. Thereafter his career took a new turn when he entered the service of the colonial government of Van Diemensland (Tasmania). After serving two more years in the military (1829\u201331) he returned to Tasmania, occupying the post of colonial secretary from 1834 to 1842. In this senior post he gained valuable experience showing a gift for efficient administration. However after a clash with the lieutenant-governor he left Tasmania in 1842. Later in 1842 a report on his clash with the lieutenant governor exonerated him from any misconduct and he was offered the post of colonial secretary of the cape colony. He arrived at the Cape in April 1843. It is situated at the confluence of the Keisie and Kingna rivers.<ref name=\"Heydenrych\">Heydenrych, H. 2005. 30 Stories of Montagu and its people.</ref>\n\n==The Museum and its theme==\n\nThe main aim of the Montagu Museum is to research and portray the cultural-historical heritage of Montagu and its people.\n\nThe Museum owns a collection of oil paintings and drawings by the famous South-African artist Francios Krige who lived and worked in Montagu. Included in the collection is one of his major works \u2018\u2019Begrafnis in die Karoo\u2019\u2019 (Burial in the Karoo) which he bequeathed to the Museum.\n\nThe Museum has its own oval date stamp which is an exact replica of the postmark which was first used in Montagu in 1858. The distinctive design to post offices in the Cape from 1853 onwards, were based on Liverpudlian, and American date stamps. All letters and postcards mailed at the Museum are stamped with this unique date stamp.\n\nThe T.O Honiball collection of cartoons and books is an important acquisition. This famous South-African cartoonist whose worked appeared in the Die Burger for many years, became a household name for his satirical and humorous depiction of animal characters which still captivate old and young alike.\n\nTake a look at the Brink Brothers exhibition at the Museum. Between 1902 and 1985 the Brink Bros enterprises was of mayor economic significance to the town. They were general dealers who owned a hotel, a department store, a winery which produced an extensive range of exotic liqueurs and fortified wines; a canning factory which exported canned fruit and they also produced dried fruit for the export market.\n\nThe archive which houses all documents, photographs and Africana relating to the history of Montagu, is becoming an increasingly important research centre. The devastation caused by the flood of 25 January 1981 has been fully documented by the museum.\n\nThe Museum has been researching traditional herbal remedies since 1982 and these are for sale at the museum or can be ordered by post.\n\n==Montagu Museum comprises the following historical buildings in Long Street==\n\n===Joubert House===\nIt is situated in no 25 Long Street. A proclaimed national monument which was built in 1853 and is the oldest house in the town. After the devastating flood of January 1981 it was saved from demolition and restored to its former glory by the Board of Trustees. Today it functions as a House Museum that portrays the lifestyle of the rural Victorian era. At the back of Joubert House there is an Indigenous Medicinal Plant Garden.\n\n===Montagu Museum Art Gallery===\n\nIn 2007 the new art gallery was established in a part of the KWV Building Cnr Kohler and Long Street. It is the most interesting and noteworthy example of commercial architecture in Montagu from the early 1930s. The art gallery was opened with an exciting exhibition of sculptures and works by Willie Bester, internationally recognized artist and born Montaguer. Montagu Museum Art Gallery house a permanent exhibition of work by Francois Krige.

This famous South-African cartoonist whose worked appeared in the Die Burger for many years, became a household name for his satirical and humorous depiction of animal characters which still captivate old and young alike.\n\nTake a look at the Brink Brothers exhibition at the Museum. Between 1902 and 1985 the Brink Bros enterprises was of mayor economic significance to the town. They were general dealers who owned a hotel, a department store, a winery which produced an extensive range of exotic liqueurs and fortified wines; a canning factory which exported canned fruit and they also produced dried fruit for the export market.\n\nThe archive which houses all documents, photographs and Africana relating to the history of Montagu, is becoming an increasingly important research centre. The devastation caused by the flood of 25 January 1981 has been fully documented by the museum.\n\nThe Museum has been researching traditional herbal remedies since 1982 and these are for sale at the museum or can be ordered by post.\n\n==Montagu Museum comprises the following historical buildings in Long Street==\n\n===Joubert House===\nIt is situated in no 25 Long Street. A proclaimed national monument which was built in 1853 and is the oldest house in the town. After the devastating flood of January 1981 it was saved from demolition and restored to its former glory by the Board of Trustees. Today it functions as a House Museum that portrays the lifestyle of the rural Victorian era. At the back of Joubert House there is an Indigenous Medicinal Plant Garden.\n\n===Montagu Museum Art Gallery===\n\nIn 2007 the new art gallery was established in a part of the KWV Building Cnr Kohler and Long Street. It is the most interesting and noteworthy example of commercial architecture in Montagu from the early 1930s. The art gallery was opened with an exciting exhibition of sculptures and works by Willie Bester, internationally recognized artist and born Montaguer.

While the dentist tries to pull out his damaged tooth, news break out of a radio in the shop, reporting that the king is in serious depression and needs to be cheered up. In this, Oswald abandons his dental treatment, and heads outside to spread the word.\n\nIn his castle, [[Old King Cole]] <ref>Jeff Lenburg, \"The Great Cartoon Directors\", Da Capo Press, 1993, page 164.</ref> is having a long face for some reason. His personal jester tries to brighten him up but to no avail, and therefore leaves the throne room. Oswald then shows up and reads to him a book of comical rhymes. The rabbit's attempt helps a little and the king's mood improves slightly. Other entertainers (caricatures of film comedians [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Laurel and Hardy]], The [[Marx Brothers]] and [[Jimmy Durante]] <ref>Jeff Lenburg, \"The Great Cartoon Directors\", Da Capo Press, 1993, page 164.</ref>) also come in for a similar cause. Each of them has a distinctive method in providing comedy. It all comes down when some of them employs an act that involves hurling pies at each other. Eventually, everyone in the room joins the food fight, and so does the king who starts to enjoy it.\n\nMomentarily, the jester returns to the throne room to see what is happening. Upon noticing the king back in good spirits, the jester grows envious, and decides to take his grudge on one of the entertainers. The jester captures Oswald and brings the rabbit into a torture chamber at a basement of the castle.

While the dentist tries to pull out his damaged tooth, news break out of a radio in the shop, reporting that the king is in serious depression and needs to be cheered up. In this, Oswald abandons his dental treatment, and heads outside to spread the word.\n\nIn his castle, [[Old King Cole]] <ref>Jeff Lenburg, \"The Great Cartoon Directors\", Da Capo Press, 1993, page 164.</ref> is having a long face for some reason. His personal jester tries to brighten him up but to no avail, and therefore leaves the throne room. Oswald then shows up and reads to him a book of comical rhymes. The rabbit's attempt helps a little and the king's mood improves slightly. Other entertainers (caricatures of film comedians [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Laurel and Hardy]], The [[Marx Brothers]] and [[Jimmy Durante]] <ref>Jeff Lenburg, \"The Great Cartoon Directors\", Da Capo Press, 1993, page 164.</ref>) also come in for a similar cause. Each of them has a distinctive method in providing comedy. It all comes down when some of them employs an act that involves hurling pies at each other. Eventually, everyone in the room joins the food fight, and so does the king who starts to enjoy it.\n\nMomentarilly, the jester returns to the throne room to see what is happening. Upon noticing the king back in good spirits, the jester grows envious, and decides to take his grudge on one of the entertainers. The jester captures Oswald and brings the rabbit into a torture chamber at a basement of the castle. He then puts a noose around Oswald's neck, with other end of the rope being pulled by three elephants. Oswald finds this ordeal impossible to get out of.\n\nIt appears the experience at the castle was nothing more than a nightmare as Oswald wakes up and sees himself still at the dental clinic.

The human figure may symbolize the living or the dead, may reference chiefs, dancers, or various trades such as drummers or hunters, or even may be an anthropomorphic representation of a god or have other votive function.

Recently, however, there has been a movement among African art historians and other scholars to include the visual culture of other regions and time periods. The notion is that by including all African cultures and their visual culture over time in ''African art'', there will be a greater understanding of the continent's visual aesthetics across time. Finally, the arts of the people of the [[African diaspora]], in [[Brazil]], the [[Caribbean]] and the southeastern [[United States]], have also begun to be included in the study of African art.\n\n==Materials==\n[[File:Nok sculpture Louvre 70-1998-11-1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nok culture|Nok]] sculpture Louvre 70-1998-11-1.jpg|[[Nok Culture|Nok]] seated figure; 5th century BC \u2013 5th century AD; terracotta; 38&nbsp;cm (1&nbsp;ft. 3 in.); [[Mus\u00e9e du quai Branly]] (Paris).

African art often stems from the themes of religious symbolism, functionalism and utilitarianism, and many pieces of art are created for spiritual rather than purely creative purposes.  Many African cultures emphasize the importance of ancestors as intermediaries between the living, the gods, and the supreme creator, and art is seen as a way to contact these spirits of ancestors.  Art may also be used to depict gods, and is valued for its functional purposes.{{cn|date=November 2019}}  However, it is important to note that the arrival of both Christianity and Islam have also greatly influenced art of the African continent, and traditions of both have been integrated within in the beliefs and artwork of traditional African religion.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bourdillon|first=Michael|date=10 March 1975|title=Themes in the Understanding of Traditional African Religion|url=https://content.ebscohost.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=ATLA0000915181&S=R&D=rfh&EbscoContent=dGJyMNXb4kSeprE4v%2BbwOLCmr1Gep7BSsKm4TLCWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMPGuskm3qLFRuePfgeyx44D1|journal=Journal of Theology for Southern Africa|volume=|pages=37\u201350|via=EBSCO Host}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{See|Prehistoric art#Africa|History of art#Africa}}\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align = \n| total_width = 540\n| direction = horizontal\n| footer = \n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1 = Africa Nok Male Figure Kimbell.jpg\n| width1 = 140\n| height1 = \n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = Nok male figure; 500 BC-500 AD; terracotta; 49.5 \u00d7 22.2 \u00d7 16.8 cm (19.4 \u00d7 8.7 \u00d7 6.6 in); from northern [[Nigeria]]; [[Kimbell Art Museum]] ([[Fort Worth]], [[Texas]], USA)\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2 = Benin plaque in the Ethnological Museum, Berlin - 026.JPG\n| width2 = \n| height2 = \n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = Benin [[Benin bronzes|plaque]]; 16th-17th century; bronze; from the [[Kingdom of Benin]]; [[Ethnological Museum of Berlin]] (Germany)\n<!-- Image 3 -->\n| image3 = Arte yoruba, nigeria, testa da ife, 12-15mo secolo.JPG\n| width3 = \n| height3 = \n| alt3 = \n| caption3 = [[Bronze Head from Ife|Head from Ife]] (Nigeria); 14th-15th century AD; bronze; height: 36 cm (14{{fraction|1|8}} in); [[British Museum]] (London)\n}}\n\nThe origins of African art lie long before recorded history.

Often depicting the abundance of surrounding nature, the art was often abstract interpretations of animals, plant life, or natural designs and shapes. The [[Nubia]]n [[Kingdom of Kush]] in modern [[Sudan]] was in close and often hostile contact with Egypt, and produced monumental sculpture mostly derivative of styles that did not lead to the north. In West Africa, the earliest known sculptures are from the [[Nok culture]] which thrived between 1,500&nbsp;BC and 500&nbsp;AD in modern [[Nigeria]], with clay figures typically with elongated bodies and angular shapes.<ref name=\"PB 2014\">Breunig, Peter. 2014.

Colonization during the nineteenth century set up a Western understanding hinged on the belief that African art lacked technical ability due to its low socioeconomic status.\n\nAt the start of the twentieth century, art historians like [[Carl Einstein]], [[Micha\u0142 Sobeski]] and [[Leo Frobenius]] published important works about the thematic, giving to African art the status of [[Work of art|aesthetic object]], not only of [[Cultural artifact|ethnographic object]].<ref>Strother, Z.

These artists saw in African art a formal perfection and sophistication unified with phenomenal expressive power. The study of and response to African art, by artists at the beginning of the twentieth century facilitated an explosion of interest in the abstraction, organisation and reorganisation of forms, and the exploration of emotional and psychological areas hitherto unseen in Western art. By these means, the status of visual art was changed. Art ceased to be merely and primarily [[aesthetic]], but became also a true medium for philosophic and intellectual discourse, and hence more truly and profoundly aesthetic than ever before.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}\n\n==Influence on Western architecture==\nEuropean architecture was strongly influenced by African art. Pioneers like [[Antonio Sant'Elia]], [[Le Corbusier]], [[Pier Luigi Nervi]], [[Theo van Doesburg]] and [[Erich Mendelsohn]] were also sculptors and painters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/augustaafricanart/what-is-african-art|title=What is African Art?|publisher=Augusta African Art|archive-url= |url-status=}}</ref> During the 1950s, European architects transformed buildings into big-scale sculptures, replacing unnecessary decoration (so criticized by [[Adolf Loos]]), by integrating textured murals and large bas-reliefs in walls. During the 1960s, African art influenced [[Brutalism]], both in language and symbolism, particularly in the late [[Le Corbusier]], [[Oscar Niemeyer]] and [[Paul Rudolph (architect)|Paul Rudolph]]. The powerful work of [[John Lautner]] reminds of artifacts from the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]]; the sensual projects of [[Patricio Pouchulu]] honour the bare wooden sculptures of the [[Dogon people|Dogon]] and [[Baoul\u00e9 people|Baoul\u00e9]].

In their original contexts, ceremonial masks are used for celebrations, initiations, crop harvesting, and war preparation. The masks are worn by a chosen or initiated dancer. During the mask ceremony the dancer goes into deep trance, and during this state of mind he  \"communicates\" with his ancestors. The masks can be worn in three different ways: vertically covering the face: as helmets, encasing the entire head, and as crest, resting upon the head, which was commonly covered by material as part of the disguise. African masks often represent a spirit and it is strongly believed that the spirit of the ancestors possesses the wearer. Most African masks are made with wood, and can be decorated with: [[Ivory]], animal hair, plant fibers (such as raffia), pigments (like [[kaolin]]), stones, and semi-precious [[Gemstone|gem]]s also are included in the masks.\n\nStatues, usually of wood or ivory, are often inlaid with [[cowrie]] shells, metal studs and nails. Decorative clothing is also commonplace and comprises another large part of African art. Among the most complex of [[African textiles]] is the colorful, strip-woven [[Kente cloth]] of [[Ghana]]. Boldly patterned [[mudcloth]] is another well known technique.\n\n== Contemporary African art ==\n{{Main|Contemporary African art}}\n[[File:Bonn Deutsche Welle Fest f\u00fcr Neptun.jpg|left|thumb|upright|''Fest f\u00fcr Neptun'', sculpture on the outside areas of the building of the [[Deutsche Welle]] ([[Sch\u00fcrmann-Bau]]) in [[Bonn]]]]\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Chidongo.JPG|thumb|Wood sculpture attributed to [[Zimbabwe]]an artist [[Gideon Chidongo]], 4th quarter of 20th century.]] -->\nAfrica is home to a thriving [[contemporary art]] fine art culture.  This has been understudied until recently, due to scholars' and art collectors' emphasis on traditional art. Notable modern artists include [[El Anatsui]], [[Marlene Dumas]], [[William Kentridge]], [[Karel Nel]], [[Kendell Geers]], [[Yinka Shonibare]], [[Zerihun Yetmgeta]], Odhiambo Siangla, Elias Jengo, [[Olu Oguibe]], [[Lubaina Himid]], and [[Bili Bidjocka]], [[Henry Tayali]]. Art [[wikt:biennale|bienniale]]s are held in [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]], and [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]]. Many contemporary African artists are represented in museum collections, and their art may sell for high prices at art [[auction]]s. Despite this, many contemporary African artists tend to have a difficult time finding a market for their work. Many contemporary African arts borrow heavily from traditional predecessors. Ironically, this emphasis on abstraction is seen by Westerners as an imitation of European and American [[Cubism|Cubist]] and totemic artists, such as [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]] and [[Henri Matisse]], who, in the early twentieth century, were heavily influenced by traditional African art. This period was critical to the evolution of Western [[modernism]] in visual arts, symbolized by Picasso's breakthrough painting ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Richardson|first=John|title=A Life of Picasso: The Cubist Rebel, 1907\u20131916|year=2007|publisher=Knopf|location=New York|isbn=978-0-375-71150-3}}</ref>\n\nToday [[Fathi Hassan]] is considered a major early representative of contemporary black African art.

Akan art is known for vibrant artistic traditions, including textiles, sculptures, [[Akan goldweights]], as well as gold and silver [[jewelry]]. The Akan people are known for their strong connection between visual and verbal expressions and a distinctive blending of art and philosophy. Akan culture values [[gold]] above all other metals, and believes that it can portray the supernatural elements behind many things, including royal authority and cultural values. The Asante, who are a dominant Akan-speaking culture in Ghana, trace their origins back to the arrival of a golden-stool, which is now said to hold the soul of the Asante nation within it. Gold was considered an earthly counterpart to the sun and was often utilized in art to display the importance of the king, making it an essential representation of their cultural and social values.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kowalski|first=Jeff Karl|date=July 2018|title=Symbols of the Asante Kingdom|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?sid=6ed0db9e-64b5-49b3-a0f9-8bcd15711793%40sessionmgr103&vid=8&ReturnUrl=http%3a%2f%2fweb.b.ebscohost.com%2fehost%2fdetail%2fdetail%3fvid%3d6%26sid%3d6ed0db9e-64b5-49b3-a0f9-8bcd15711793%2540sessionmgr103%26bdata%3dJkF1dGhUeXBlPWNvb2tpZSxpcCxjcGlkJmN1c3RpZD1zODQxOTIzOSZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmU%253d|journal=Dig into History|volume=20|pages=18\u201321|via=EBSCO Host}}{{Dead link|date=September 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>  Kente cloth is another extremely important art tradition of Akan culture.

Nigeria draws its inspiration for their art from traditional folk heritage of the region. There are different types of artwork from the Nigerian culture. Some of these works of art can be stone carvings, potteries, glass work, wood carvings and bronze works. Benin and Awka are considered to be the central places for wood carving. Woodcarvers have been thriving throughout the south of Nigeria from time immemorial.\n \n'''Examples of Nigerian Traditional Art'''\n\n'''Masks'''\n\nMasks are a piece of the animist confidence of the Yoruba individuals. The veils are painted, and fans wear them at memorial services and different functions to mollify the spirits.\n\n'''Pottery'''\n\nPottery has a long custom in Nigeria. Pottery was well known from 100 B.C. These days Suleja, Abuja and Ilorin are viewed as significant figures of customary ceramics. Potters in Nigeria are frequently female, and usually practice for the methods to be passed on through families. \n\n'''Textiles'''\n\nYorubas utilize a bush to make indigo-shaded batik-colored fabric. Ladies generally do the withering, while in the north, the specialty is drilled only by men. Weavers everywhere throughout the nation produce a splendid texture with ribbon structures. Oyo state is known for its fine loom materials while fabric from Abia state utilizes a broadloom strategy.\n\n{{main|Nok culture}}\nThe Nok culture is an early [[Iron Age]] population whose material remains are named after the [[Ham people|Ham]] village of [[Nok]] in [[Kaduna State]] of [[Nigeria]], where their famous [[terracotta]] sculptures were first discovered in 1928. The Nok Culture appeared in [[northern Nigeria]] around 1500 BC<ref name=\"PB 2014\">Breunig, Peter. 2014. Nok: African Sculpture in Archaeological Context: p. 21.</ref> and vanished under unknown circumstances around 500 AD, thus having lasted approximately 2,000 years.<ref name=\"FB 1969\">Fagg, Bernard. 1969. Recent work in west Africa: New light on the Nok culture. World Archaeology 1(1): 41\u201350.</ref>\n\nThe function of Nok terracotta sculptures remains unknown. For the most part, the terracotta is preserved in the form of scattered fragments. That is why Nok art is best known today only for the heads, both male and female, whose hairstyles are particularly detailed and refined. The statues are in fragments because the discoveries are usually made from [[alluvium|alluvial mud]], in terrain made by the erosion of water. The terracotta statues found there are hidden, rolled, polished, and broken. Rarely are works of great size conserved intact making them highly valued on the international art market. The terracotta figures are hollow, coil built, nearly life-sized human heads and bodies that are depicted with highly stylized features, abundant [[jewellery|jewelry]], and varied postures.\n\nLittle is known of the original function of the pieces, but theories include ancestor portrayal, [[grave marker]]s, and [[amulet|charms]] to prevent crop failure, infertility, and illness. Also, based on the dome-shaped bases found on several figures, they could have been used as finials for the roofs of ancient structures. Margaret Young-Sanchez, Associate Curator of Art of the Americas, Africa, and Oceania in [[The Cleveland Museum of Art]], explains that most Nok ceramics were shaped by hand from coarse-grained clay and subtractively sculpted in a manner that suggests an influence from wood carving. After some drying, the sculptures were covered with slip and burnished to produce a smooth, glossy surface. The figures are hollow, with several openings to facilitate thorough drying and firing. The firing process most likely resembled that used today in Nigeria, in which the pieces are covered with grass, twigs, and leaves and burned for several hours.\n\nAs a result of natural erosion and deposition, Nok terracottas were scattered at various depths throughout the Sahel grasslands, causing difficulty in the dating and classification of the mysterious artifacts. Luckily, two archaeological sites, [[Samun Dukiya]] and [[Taruga]], were found containing Nok art that had remained unmoved. [[Radiocarbon dating|Radiocarbon]] and [[Thermoluminescence dating|thermo-luminescence]] tests narrowed the sculptures\u2019 age down to between 2,000 and 2,500 years ago, making them some of the oldest in Western Africa. Many further dates were retrieved in the course of new archaeological excavations, extending the beginnings of the Nok tradition even further back in time.<ref name=\"BP 2014\">Breunig, P. (2014).

Female (left) and male Vertical styles]]\n\nThe [[Bambara people]] ({{lang-bm|Bamanankaw}}) adapted many artistic traditions and began to create display pieces. Before money was the main drive of creation of their artworks they used their abilities solely as a sacred craft for display of spiritual pride, religious beliefs and display of customs. Example artworks include the Bamana [[n'tomo mask]]. Other statues were created for people such as hunters and farmers so others could leave offerings after long farming seasons or group hunts. The stylistic variations in Bambara art are extreme sculptures, masks and headdresses display either stylized or realistic features, and either weathered or encrusted patinas. Until quite recently, the function of Bambara pieces was shrouded in mystery, but in the last twenty years, field studies have revealed that certain types of figures and headdresses were associated with a number of the societies that structure Bambara life. During the 1970s a group of approximately twenty figures, masks and TjiWara headdresses belonging to the so-called 'Segou style' were identified. The style is distinct and recognizable by its typical flat faces, arrow-shaped noses, all-over body triangular scarifications and, on the figures, splayed hands.\n\n;Masks\nThere are three major and one minor type of Bambara [[mask]]. The first type, used by the N'tomo society, has a typical comb-like structure above the face, is worn during dances and may be covered with cowrie shells. The second type of mask, associated with the Komo society, has a spherical head with two antelope horns on the top and an enlarged, flattened mouth. They are used during dances, but some have a thickly encrusted patina acquired during other ceremonies in which libations are poured over them.\n\nThe third type has connections with the Nama society and is carved in the form of an articulated bird's head, while the fourth, minor type, represents a stylized animal head and is used by the Kore society. Other Bambara masks are known to exist, but unlike those described above, they cannot be linked to specific societies or ceremonies. Bambara carvers have established a reputation for the zoomorphic headdresses worn by Tji-Wara society members. Although they are all different, they all display a highly abstract body, often incorporating a zig-zag motif, which represents the sun's course from east to west, and a head with two large horns. Bambara members of the Tji-Wara society wear the headdress while dancing in their fields at sowing time, hoping to increase the crop yield.\n\n;Statuettes\nBambara [[statuette]]s are primarily used during the annual ceremonies of the Guan society. During these ceremonies, a group of up to seven figures, measuring from 80 to 130&nbsp;cm in height, are removed from their sanctuaries by the elder members of the society. The sculptures are washed, re-oiled and sacrifices are offered to them at their shrines. These figures \u2013 some of which date from between the 14th and 16th centuries \u2013 usually display a typical crested coiffure, often adorned with a talisman.\n\nTwo of these figures were ascribed great significance: a seated or standing maternity figure called Guandousou \u2013 known in the West as 'Bambara Queen' \u2013 and a male figure called Guantigui, who usually appears holding a knife. The two figures were surrounded by Guannyeni attendant figures standing or seated in various positions, holding a vessel, or a musical instrument, or their breasts. During the 1970s, numerous fakes from Bamako which were based on these sculptures entered the market. They were produced in Bamako.\n\nOther Bambara figures, called Dyonyeni, are thought to be associated with either the southern Dyo society or the Kwore society. These female or hermaphrodite figures usually appear with geometric features such as large conical breasts and measure between 40 and 85&nbsp;cm in height. The blacksmith members of the Dyo society used them during dances to celebrate the end of their initiation ceremonies. They were handled, held by dancers and placed in the middle of the ceremonial circle.\n\nAmong the corpus of Bambara figures, Boh sculptures are perhaps the best known. These statues represent a highly stylized animal or human figure, and are made of wood which is repeatedly covered in thick layers of earth impregnated with sacrificial materials such as millet, chicken or goat blood, kola nuts and alcoholic drinks. They were employed by the Kono and the Komo societies and served as receptacles for spiritual forces, and could, in turn, be used for apotropaic purposes.\n\nEach special creative trait a person obtained was seen as a different way to please higher spirits.\n\n=====Dogon=====\n[[Dogon people|Dogon]] art is primarily sculpture. Dogon art revolves around [[Dogon religion|Dogon religious]] values, ideals, and freedoms (Laude, 19). Dogon sculptures are not made to be seen publicly, and are commonly hidden from the public eye within the houses of families, sanctuaries, or kept with the [[Hogon]] (Laude, 20). The importance of secrecy is due to the symbolic meaning behind the pieces and the process by which they are made.\n\nThemes found throughout Dogon sculpture consist of figures with raised arms, superimposed bearded figures, horsemen, stools with caryatids, women with children, figures covering their faces, women grinding pearl millet, women bearing vessels on their heads, donkeys bearing cups, musicians, dogs, quadruped-shaped troughs or benches, figures bending from the waist, mirror-images, aproned figures, and standing figures (Laude, 46\u201352). Signs of other contacts and origins are evident in Dogon art. The Dogon people were not the first inhabitants of the cliffs of Bandiagara. Influence from [[Tellem]] art is evident in Dogon art because of its rectilinear designs (Laude, 24).\n\nDogon art is extremely versatile, although common stylistic characteristics \u2013 such as a tendency towards stylization \u2013 are apparent on the statues. Their art deals with the myths whose complex ensemble regulates the life of the individual. The sculptures are preserved in innumerable sites of worship, personal or family altars, altars for rain, altars to protect hunters, in market. As a general characterization of Dogon statues, one could say that they render the human body in a simplified way, reducing it to its essentials. Some are extremely elongated with emphasis on geometric forms. The subjective impression is one of immobility with a mysterious sense of a solemn gravity and serene majesty, although conveying at the same time a latent movement. Dogon sculpture recreates the hermaphroditic silhouettes of the Tellem, featuring raised arms and a thick patina made of blood and millet beer. The four Nommo couples, the mythical ancestors born of the god Amma, ornament stools, pillars or men's meeting houses, door locks, and granary doors. The primordial couple is represented sitting on a stool, the base of which depicts the earth while the upper surface represents the sky; the two are interconnected by the Nommo. The seated female figures, their hands on their abdomen, are linked to the fertility cult, incarnating the first ancestor who died in childbirth, and are the object of offerings of food and sacrifices by women who are expecting a child.\n\nKneeling statues of protective spirits are placed at the head of the dead to absorb their spiritual strength and to be their intermediaries with the world of the dead, into which they accompany the deceased before once again being placed on the shrines of the ancestors. Horsemen are reminders of the fact that, according to myth, the horse was the first animal present on earth. The Dogon style has evolved into a kind of cubism: ovoid head, squared shoulders, tapered extremities, pointed breasts, forearms, and thighs on a parallel plane, hairdos stylized by three or four incised lines. Dogon sculptures serve as a physical medium in initiations and as an explanation of the world. They serve to transmit an understanding to the initiated, who will decipher the statue according to the level of their knowledge. Carved animal figures, such as dogs and ostriches, are placed on village foundation altars to commemorate sacrificed animals, while granary doors, stools and house posts are also adorned with figures and symbols.\n\nThere are nearly eighty styles of masks, but their basic characteristic is great boldness in the use of geometric shapes, independent of the various animals they are supposed to represent. The structure of a large number of masks is based on the interplay of vertical and horizontal lines and shapes. Another large group has triangular, conic shapes. All masks have large geometric eyes and stylized features. The masks are often polychrome, but on many the color is lost; after the ceremonies they were left on the ground and quickly deteriorated because of termites and other conditions. The Dogon continue an ancient masquerading tradition, which commemorates the origin of death. According to their myths, death came into the world as a result of primeval man's transgressions against the divine order. Dama memorial ceremonies are held to accompany the dead into the ancestral realm and restore order to the universe. The performance of masqueraders \u2013 sometimes as many as 400 \u2013 at these ceremonies is considered absolutely necessary. In the case of the dama, the timing, types of masks involved, and other ritual elements are often specific to one or two villages and may not resemble those seen in locations only several kilometres distant. The masks also appear during baga-bundo rites performed by small numbers of masqueraders before the burial of a male Dogon. Dogon masks evoke the form of animals associated with their mythology, yet their significance is only understood by the highest ranking cult members whose role is to explain the meaning of each mask to a captivated audience.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nDogonSatimbe1.JPG|Person who wears a Satimbe mask\nDogonWalu 01.JPG|Person who wears a Walu mask, based on an antilope\nMali, dogon, maschera di iena, xx secolo.jpg|Mask based on a hyena; 20th century; [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] (USA)\nPorteMali.jpg|Decorated door in the [[Hogon]] village\nBrooklyn Museum 61.2 Figure of a Seated Musician Koro Player (2).jpg|Figure of a seated musician (koro player); late 18th century; 55.8 x 17.7 x 10.8&nbsp;cm (22 x 7 x 4{{1/4}} in.); [[Brooklyn Museum]] (New York City)\nFigure of a Kneeling Woman MET DP-13314-032.jpg|Figure of a kneeling woman; circa 1500; wood; height: 35.2&nbsp;cm (13{{fraction|7|8}} in.); [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\nFigure- Equestrian MET 1979.206.85 a.jpeg|Equestrian figure; 16th\u201317th century; wood; height: 68.9&nbsp;cm (27{{fraction|1|8}} in.); Metropolitan Museum of Art\nDogonStool.jpg|Stool; possibly late 19th to early 20th century; wood & pigment; [[National Museum of African Art]] ([[Washington D.C.]], USA)\nBrooklyn Museum 1995.171.11a-c Kanaga Mask in Three Pieces.jpg|Kanaga mask in three pieces; 20th century; 108 x 59.1 x 22.9 cm (42{{1/2}} x 23{{1/4}} x 9 in); [[Brooklyn Museum]] (New York City)\n</gallery>\n\n=====Other ethnic groups of Mali=====\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFemale Figure with Raised Arm MET vs1979 206 64.jpg|Black and white picture of a female figure with raised arm; 15th\u201317th century; wood (ficus, moraceae), sacrificial materials; height: 44.8&nbsp;cm (17{{fraction|5|8}} in.); by the [[Tellem|Tellem people]]; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\nFigura zoomorfa.

Culturally, it is extremely rich. In part, this is because so few people from Burkina have become Muslim or Christian.<ref>Roy, Christopher D. [http://africa.uima.uiowa.edu/topic-essays/show/37 \"The Art of Burkina Faso\"], Art & Life in Africa, University of Iowa.</ref> Many of the ancient artistic traditions for which Africa is so well known have been preserved in Burkina Faso because so many people continue to honor the ancestral spirits, and the spirits of nature. In great part, they honor the spirits through the use of masks and carved figures. Many of the countries to the north of Burkina Faso had become predominantly Muslim, while many of the countries to the south of Burkina Faso are heavily Christian. In contrast, many of the people of Burkina Faso continue to offer prayers and sacrifices to the spirits of nature and to the spirits of their ancestors. The result is that they continue to use the sorts of art that we see in museums in Europe and America.<ref name=\":0\">Roy, Christopher D. ''Art of the Upper Volta Rivers'', 1987, Paris: Chaffin.</ref>\n\nOne of the principal obstacles to understanding the art of Burkina Faso, including that of the Bwa, &nbsp;has been a confusion between the styles of the Bwa, \"gurunsi\", and Mossi, &nbsp;and a confusion of the Bwa people &nbsp;with their neighbors to the west the Bobo people. &nbsp;This confusion was the result of the use by French colonial officers of Jula &nbsp;interpreters at the turn of the century. &nbsp;these interpreters considered the two peoples to be the same and so referred to the Bobo as \"Bobo-Fing\" and to the Bwa as \"Bobo-Oule.\" &nbsp; In fact these two peoples are not related at all. Their languages are quite different, their social systems are quite different, &nbsp;and certainly their art is quite different.&nbsp;In terms of artistic styles the confusion stems from the fact that the Bwa, \"gurunsi'\" and Mossi &nbsp;make masks that are covered with red white and black geometric graphic patterns. &nbsp;This is simply the style of the Voltaic or Gur peoples, &nbsp;and also includes the Dogon and other peoples who speak Voltaic languages.<ref name=\"uiowa\">{{cite web|url=http://www.uiowa.edu/~africart/Bobo_Bwa/index.htm |title=Art &amp; Life in Africa \u2013 The University of Iowa Museum of Art |publisher=uiowa.edu |accessdate=2014-12-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630060732/http://www.uiowa.edu/~africart/Bobo_Bwa/index.htm |archivedate=2013-06-30 }}</ref>\n\n====Ivory Coast====\n{{Main|Culture of Ivory Coast}}\n[[File:Child-soldier-afrika.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[military use of children|Childsoldier]] in the Ivory Coast'', [[Gilbert G.

Traditional Ethiopian church art]]\nEthiopian art from the 4th century until the 20th can be divided into two broad groupings. First comes a distinctive tradition of [[Christianity|Christian]] art, mostly for churches, in forms including [[painting]], [[Ethiopian cross|crosses]], [[icons]], [[illuminated manuscripts]], and other metalwork such as crowns.  Secondly there are popular arts and crafts such as textiles, [[basketry]] and [[jewellery]], in which Ethiopian traditions are closer to those of other peoples in the region. [[History of Ethiopia|Its history]] goes back almost three thousand years to the kingdom of [[D'mt]]. The [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] has been the predominant religion in Ethiopia for over 1500 years, for most of this period in a very close relation, or union, with the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Christianity]] of [[Egypt]], so that [[Coptic art]] has been the main formative influence on Ethiopian church art.\n\n[[File:Lalibela Bet Maryam 1 (28397479782).jpg|thumb|upright|The rock-hewn Church of Bet Maryam in Lalibela.]]\nPrehistoric [[rock art]] comparable to that of other African sites survives in a number of places, and until the arrival of Christianity stone [[stela]]e, often carved with simple reliefs, were erected as grave-markers and for other purposes in many regions; [[Tiya]] is one important site. The \"pre-Axumite\" [[Iron Age]] culture of about the 5th century BCE to the 1st century CE was influenced by the [[Kingdom of Kush]] to the north, and settlers from [[Arabia]], and produced cities with simple temples in stone, such as the ruined one at [[Yeha]], which is impressive for its date in the 4th or 5th century BCE.\n\nThe powerful [[Kingdom of Aksum]] emerged in the 1st century BCE and dominated Ethiopia until the 10th century, having become very largely Christian from the 4th century.<ref name=\"Biasio\">Biasio</ref> Although some buildings and large, pre-Christian [[Stele|stelae]] exist, there appears to be no surviving Ethiopian Christian art from the Axumite period. However, the earliest works remaining show a clear continuity with Coptic art of earlier periods. There was considerable destruction of churches and their contents in the 16th century when the country was invaded by Muslim neighbours. The revival of art after this was influenced by Catholic European art in both iconography and elements of style, but retained its Ethiopian character. In the 20th century, Western artists and architects began to be commissioned by the government, and to train local students, and more fully Westernized art was produced alongside continuations of traditional church art.<ref name=\"Biasio\"/>\n\nChurch paintings in Ethiopia were likely produced as far back as the [[Christianity in Ethiopia|introduction of Christianity]] in the 4th century AD,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://smarthistory.org/christian-ethiopian-art/|title=Christian Ethiopian art|date=2016-12-22|work=Smarthistory|access-date=2017-07-27|language=en}}</ref> although the earliest surviving examples come from the church of Debre Selam Mikael in the [[Tigray Region]], dated to the 11th century AD.<ref name=\"teferi 2015 242\">{{citation|first=Dawit|last=Teferi|editor-first=Philip|editor-last=Briggs|title=Ethiopia|chapter=A Short History of Ethiopian Church Art|year=2015|orig-year=1995|location=Chalfont St Peter|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|isbn=978-1-84162-922-3|page=242|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gU_fCgAAQBAJ|postscript= .}}</ref> However, the 7th-century AD followers of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] who fled to [[Axum]] in temporary exile mentioned that the original [[Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion]] was decorated with paintings.<ref name=\"teferi 2015 242\"/> Other early paintings include those from the [[Rock-cut architecture|rock-hewn]] churches of [[Lalibela]], dated to the 12th century AD, and in nearby Geneta Maryam, dated to the 13th century AD.<ref name=\"teferi 2015 242\"/> However, paintings in [[illuminated manuscript]]s predate the earliest surviving church paintings; for instance, the Ethiopian [[Garima Gospels]] of the 4th\u20136th centuries AD contain [[Christian art|illuminated scenes]] imitating the contemporary [[Byzantine art|Byzantine style]].<ref>{{citation|last=De Lorenzi|first=James|title=Guardians of the Tradition: Historians and Historical Writing in Ethiopia and Eritrea|location=Rochester|publisher=[[University of Rochester Press]]|year=2015|isbn=978-1-58046-519-9|pages=15\u201316|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c1WECgAAQBAJ| postscript = .}}</ref>\n\nEthiopian painting, on walls, in books, and in [[icon]]s,<ref>{{Cite book|oclc=848786240 |title=Ethiopian icons: catalogue of the collection of the Institute of Ethiopian studies, Addis Ababa university|editor=Carolyn Gossage|editor2=Stanley Chojnacki|publisher=Skira|year=2000|isbn=8881186462|location=Milano|pages=|language=English}}</ref> is highly distinctive, though the style and [[iconography]] are closely related to the simplified Coptic version of Late Antique and Byzantine Christian art.

St. Gorgias Press.</ref> They are usually [[copper alloy]] or [[brass]], plated (at least originally) with gold or silver. The heads are typically flat [[casting|cast]] plates with elaborate and complex [[openwork]] decoration. The cross motif emerges from the decoration, with the whole design often forming a rotated square or circular shape, though the designs are highly varied and inventive. Many incorporate curved motifs rising from the base, which are called the \"arms of [[Adam]]\". Except in recent Western-influenced examples, they usually have no ''corpus'', or figure of Christ, and the design often incorporates numerous smaller crosses.  Engraved figurative imagery has sometimes been added.  Crosses are mostly either [[processional cross]]es, with the metal head mounted on a long wooden staff, carried in religious processions and during the [[liturgy]], or hand crosses, with a shorter metal handle in the same casting as the head. Smaller crosses worn as jewellery are also common.\n\nEthiopia has great ethnic and linguistic diversity, and styles in secular traditional crafts vary greatly in different parts of the country. There are a range of traditions in textiles, many with woven geometric decoration, although many types are also usually plain. Ethiopian church practices make a great deal of use of colourful textiles, and the more elaborate types are widely used as church vestments and as hangings, curtains and wrappings in churches, although they have now largely been supplanted by Western fabrics. Examples of both types can be seen in the picture at the top of the article.  Icons may normally be veiled with a semi-transparent or opaque cloth; very thin [[chiffon (fabric)|chiffon]]-type cotton cloth is a speciality of Ethiopia, though usually with no pattern.\n\nColourful basketry with a coiled construction is common in rural Ethiopia. The products have many uses, such as storing grains, seeds and food and being used as tables and bowls. The Muslim city of [[Harar]] is well known for its high-quality basketry,<ref>{{cite web|title=Ethiopian Handicraft|url=http://www.ethiopianhandicraft-femseda.org/home3.htm|accessdate=22 June 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701023243/http://www.ethiopianhandicraft-femseda.org/home3.htm|archivedate=1 July 2012}}</ref> and many craft products of the Muslim minority relate to wider Islamic decorative traditions.\n\n====Tanzania====\n{{Main|Culture of Tanzania#Arts}}\n[[File:Modern Makonde carving in ebony.jpg|thumb|Modern [[Makonde people|Makonde]] carving in [[ebony]]]]\nTinga Tinga art has roots in decorating hut walls in central and south Tanzania. It was first in 1968 when Edward Said Tingatinga started to paint on wooden sheets with enamel colours when Tinga Tinga art became known. The art of the [[Makonde people|Makonde]] must be subdivided into different areas. The Makonde are known as master carvers throughout East Africa, and their statuary that can be found being sold in tourist markets and in museums alike. They traditionally carve household objects, figures and masks. Since the 1950s the so-called Modern Makonde Art has been developed. An essential step was the turning to abstract figures, mostly spirits (Shetani) that play a special role. Makonde are also part of the important contemporary artists of Africa today. An outstanding position is taken by George Lilanga.\n\n===Central Africa===\n====Democratic Republic of Congo====\n=====Kuba Kingdom=====\n{{main|Kuba art}}\n{{See also|Kuba textiles|Kuba divination|Kuba masquerade|Ndop (Kuba)|19th Century Drinking Horn#Kuba Kingdom}}\nThe [[Kuba Kingdom]] (also rendered as the Kingdom of the Bakuba, [[Songora]] or Bushongo) was a [[List of kingdoms in pre-colonial Africa|pre-colonial kingdom]] in [[Central Africa]].

A great deal of the art was created for the courts of chiefs and kings and was profusely decorated, incorporating [[cowrie shells]] and animal skins (especially leopard) as symbols of wealth, prestige and power. Masks are also important to the Kuba. They are used both in the rituals of the court and in the initiation of boys into adulthood, as well as at funerals.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nAfrikaabteilung in Ethnological Museum Berlin 99.JPG|Ngady-Mwash mask; 19th century; [[Ethnological Museum of Berlin]] (Germany).

A carver held relatively high status, which was displayed by an [[adze]] (axe) that he carried over his shoulder. Luba art was not very uniform because of the vast territory which the kingdom controlled.  However, some characteristics are common.

Fang art is characterized by organized clarity and distinct lines and shapes. Bieri, boxes to hold the remains of ancestors, are carved with protective figures. Masks are worn in ceremonies and for hunting. The faces are painted white with black features. Myene art centers around Myene rituals for death. Female ancestors are represented by white painted masks worn by male relatives. The Bekota use brass and copper to cover their carvings. They use baskets to hold ancestral remains.

The human figure may symbolize the living or the dead, may reference chiefs, dancers, or various trades such as drummers or hunters, or even may be an anthropomorphic representation of a god or have other votive function. Another common theme is the inter-morphosis of human and animal.\n*Visual abstraction: African artworks tend to favor visual abstraction over naturalistic representation.

Recently, however, there has been a movement among African art historians and other scholars to include the visual culture of other regions and time periods. The notion is that by including all African cultures and their visual culture over time in ''African art'', there will be a greater understanding of the continent's visual aesthetics across time. Finally, the arts of the people of the [[African diaspora]], in [[Brazil]], the [[Caribbean]] and the southeastern [[United States]], have also begun to be included in the study of African art.\n\n==Materials==\n[[File:Nok sculpture Louvre 70-1998-11-1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nok culture|Nok]] sculpture Louvre 70-1998-11-1.jpg|[[Nok Culture|Nok]] seated figure; 5th century BC \u2013 5th century AD; terracotta; 38&nbsp;cm (1&nbsp;ft. 3 in.); [[Mus\u00e9e du quai Branly]] (Paris).

African art often stems from the themes of religious symbolism, functionalism and utilitarianism, and many pieces of art are created for spiritual rather than purely creative purposes.  Many African cultures emphasize the importance of ancestors as intermediaries between the living, the gods, and the supreme creator, and art is seen as a way to contact these spirits of ancestors.  Art may also be used to depict gods, and is valued for its functional purposes.{{cn|date=November 2019}}  However, it is important to note that the arrival of both Christianity and Islam have also greatly influenced art of the African continent, and traditions of both have been integrated within in the beliefs and artwork of traditional African religion.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bourdillon|first=Michael|date=10 March 1975|title=Themes in the Understanding of Traditional African Religion|url=https://content.ebscohost.com/ContentServer.asp?T=P&P=AN&K=ATLA0000915181&S=R&D=rfh&EbscoContent=dGJyMNXb4kSeprE4v%2BbwOLCmr1Gep7BSsKm4TLCWxWXS&ContentCustomer=dGJyMPGuskm3qLFRuePfgeyx44D1|journal=Journal of Theology for Southern Africa|volume=|pages=37\u201350|via=EBSCO Host}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{See|Prehistoric art#Africa|History of art#Africa}}\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align = \n| total_width = 540\n| direction = horizontal\n| footer = \n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1 = Africa Nok Male Figure Kimbell.jpg\n| width1 = 140\n| height1 = \n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = Nok male figure; 500 BC-500 AD; terracotta; 49.5 \u00d7 22.2 \u00d7 16.8 cm (19.4 \u00d7 8.7 \u00d7 6.6 in); from northern [[Nigeria]]; [[Kimbell Art Museum]] ([[Fort Worth]], [[Texas]], USA)\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2 = Benin plaque in the Ethnological Museum, Berlin - 026.JPG\n| width2 = \n| height2 = \n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = Benin [[Benin bronzes|plaque]]; 16th-17th century; bronze; from the [[Kingdom of Benin]]; [[Ethnological Museum of Berlin]] (Germany)\n<!-- Image 3 -->\n| image3 = Arte yoruba, nigeria, testa da ife, 12-15mo secolo.JPG\n| width3 = \n| height3 = \n| alt3 = \n| caption3 = [[Bronze Head from Ife|Head from Ife]] (Nigeria); 14th-15th century AD; bronze; height: 36 cm (14{{fraction|1|8}} in); [[British Museum]] (London)\n}}\n\nThe origins of African art lie long before recorded history.

Often depicting the abundance of surrounding nature, the art was often abstract interpretations of animals, plant life, or natural designs and shapes. The [[Nubia]]n [[Kingdom of Kush]] in modern [[Sudan]] was in close and often hostile contact with Egypt, and produced monumental sculpture mostly derivative of styles that did not lead to the north. In West Africa, the earliest known sculptures are from the [[Nok culture]] which thrived between 1,500&nbsp;BC and 500&nbsp;AD in modern [[Nigeria]], with clay figures typically with elongated bodies and angular shapes.<ref name=\"PB 2014\">Breunig, Peter. 2014.

Colonization during the nineteenth century set up a Western understanding hinged on the belief that African art lacked technical ability due to its low socioeconomic status.\n\nAt the start of the twentieth century, art historians like [[Carl Einstein]], [[Micha\u0142 Sobeski]] and [[Leo Frobenius]] published important works about the thematic, giving to African art the status of [[Work of art|aesthetic object]], not only of [[Cultural artifact|ethnographic object]].<ref>Strother, Z.

These artists saw in African art a formal perfection and sophistication unified with phenomenal expressive power. The study of and response to African art, by artists at the beginning of the twentieth century facilitated an explosion of interest in the abstraction, organisation and reorganisation of forms, and the exploration of emotional and psychological areas hitherto unseen in Western art. By these means, the status of visual art was changed. Art ceased to be merely and primarily [[aesthetic]], but became also a true medium for philosophic and intellectual discourse, and hence more truly and profoundly aesthetic than ever before.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}\n\n==Influence on Western architecture==\nEuropean architecture was strongly influenced by African art. Pioneers like [[Antonio Sant'Elia]], [[Le Corbusier]], [[Pier Luigi Nervi]], [[Theo van Doesburg]] and [[Erich Mendelsohn]] were also sculptors and painters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/augustaafricanart/what-is-african-art|title=What is African Art?|publisher=Augusta African Art|archive-url= |url-status=}}</ref> During the 1950s, European architects transformed buildings into big-scale sculptures, replacing unnecessary decoration (so criticized by [[Adolf Loos]]), by integrating textured murals and large bas-reliefs in walls. During the 1960s, African art influenced [[Brutalism]], both in language and symbolism, particularly in the late [[Le Corbusier]], [[Oscar Niemeyer]] and [[Paul Rudolph (architect)|Paul Rudolph]]. The powerful work of [[John Lautner]] reminds of artifacts from the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]]; the sensual projects of [[Patricio Pouchulu]] honour the bare wooden sculptures of the [[Dogon people|Dogon]] and [[Baoul\u00e9 people|Baoul\u00e9]].

In their original contexts, ceremonial masks are used for celebrations, initiations, crop harvesting, and war preparation. The masks are worn by a chosen or initiated dancer. During the mask ceremony the dancer goes into deep trance, and during this state of mind he  \"communicates\" with his ancestors. The masks can be worn in three different ways: vertically covering the face: as helmets, encasing the entire head, and as crest, resting upon the head, which was commonly covered by material as part of the disguise. African masks often represent a spirit and it is strongly believed that the spirit of the ancestors possesses the wearer. Most African masks are made with wood, and can be decorated with: [[Ivory]], animal hair, plant fibers (such as raffia), pigments (like [[kaolin]]), stones, and semi-precious [[Gemstone|gem]]s also are included in the masks.\n\nStatues, usually of wood or ivory, are often inlaid with [[cowrie]] shells, metal studs and nails. Decorative clothing is also commonplace and comprises another large part of African art. Among the most complex of [[African textiles]] is the colorful, strip-woven [[Kente cloth]] of [[Ghana]]. Boldly patterned [[mudcloth]] is another well known technique.\n\n== Contemporary African art ==\n{{Main|Contemporary African art}}\n[[File:Bonn Deutsche Welle Fest f\u00fcr Neptun.jpg|left|thumb|upright|''Fest f\u00fcr Neptun'', sculpture on the outside areas of the building of the [[Deutsche Welle]] ([[Sch\u00fcrmann-Bau]]) in [[Bonn]]]]\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Chidongo.JPG|thumb|Wood sculpture attributed to [[Zimbabwe]]an artist [[Gideon Chidongo]], 4th quarter of 20th century.]] -->\nAfrica is home to a thriving [[contemporary art]] fine art culture.

Many contemporary African artists are represented in museum collections, and their art may sell for high prices at art [[auction]]s. Despite this, many contemporary African artists tend to have a difficult time finding a market for their work. Many contemporary African arts borrow heavily from traditional predecessors. Ironically, this emphasis on abstraction is seen by Westerners as an imitation of European and American [[Cubism|Cubist]] and totemic artists, such as [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]] and [[Henri Matisse]], who, in the early twentieth century, were heavily influenced by traditional African art. This period was critical to the evolution of Western [[modernism]] in visual arts, symbolized by Picasso's breakthrough painting ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Richardson|first=John|title=A Life of Picasso: The Cubist Rebel, 1907\u20131916|year=2007|publisher=Knopf|location=New York|isbn=978-0-375-71150-3}}</ref>\n\nToday [[Fathi Hassan]] is considered a major early representative of contemporary black African art.

This fabric is almost worn by every Ghanaian tribe member.\n\n'''Colors And Meaning'''\n\nThere are different color variations for the kente, each color has different meanings.

Akan art is known for vibrant artistic traditions, including textiles, sculptures, [[Akan goldweights]], as well as gold and silver [[jewelry]]. The Akan people are known for their strong connection between visual and verbal expressions and a distinctive blending of art and philosophy. Akan culture values [[gold]] above all other metals, and believes that it can portray the supernatural elements behind many things, including royal authority and cultural values. The Asante, who are a dominant Akan-speaking culture in Ghana, trace their origins back to the arrival of a golden-stool, which is now said to hold the soul of the Asante nation within it. Gold was considered an earthly counterpart to the sun and was often utilized in art to display the importance of the king, making it an essential representation of their cultural and social values.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kowalski|first=Jeff Karl|date=July 2018|title=Symbols of the Asante Kingdom|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/delivery?sid=6ed0db9e-64b5-49b3-a0f9-8bcd15711793%40sessionmgr103&vid=8&ReturnUrl=http%3a%2f%2fweb.b.ebscohost.com%2fehost%2fdetail%2fdetail%3fvid%3d6%26sid%3d6ed0db9e-64b5-49b3-a0f9-8bcd15711793%2540sessionmgr103%26bdata%3dJkF1dGhUeXBlPWNvb2tpZSxpcCxjcGlkJmN1c3RpZD1zODQxOTIzOSZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmU%253d|journal=Dig into History|volume=20|pages=18\u201321|via=EBSCO Host}}{{Dead link|date=September 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>  Kente cloth is another extremely important art tradition of Akan culture.

Nigeria draws its inspiration for their art from traditional folk heritage of the region. There are different types of artwork from the Nigerian culture. Some of these works of art can be stone carvings, potteries, glass work, wood carvings and bronze works. Benin and Awka are considered to be the central places for wood carving. Woodcarvers have been thriving throughout the south of Nigeria from time immemorial.\n \n'''Examples of Nigerian Traditional Art'''\n\n'''Masks'''\n\nMasks are a piece of the animist confidence of the Yoruba individuals. The veils are painted, and fans wear them at memorial services and different functions to mollify the spirits.\n\n'''Pottery'''\n\nPottery has a long custom in Nigeria. Pottery was well known from 100 B.C. These days Suleja, Abuja and Ilorin are viewed as significant figures of customary ceramics. Potters in Nigeria are frequently female, and usually practice for the methods to be passed on through families. \n\n'''Textiles'''\n\nYorubas utilize a bush to make indigo-shaded batik-colored fabric. Ladies generally do the withering, while in the north, the specialty is drilled only by men. Weavers everywhere throughout the nation produce a splendid texture with ribbon structures. Oyo state is known for its fine loom materials while fabric from Abia state utilizes a broadloom strategy.\n\n{{main|Nok culture}}\nThe Nok culture is an early [[Iron Age]] population whose material remains are named after the [[Ham people|Ham]] village of [[Nok]] in [[Kaduna State]] of [[Nigeria]], where their famous [[terracotta]] sculptures were first discovered in 1928. The Nok Culture appeared in [[northern Nigeria]] around 1500 BC<ref name=\"PB 2014\">Breunig, Peter. 2014. Nok: African Sculpture in Archaeological Context: p. 21.</ref> and vanished under unknown circumstances around 500 AD, thus having lasted approximately 2,000 years.<ref name=\"FB 1969\">Fagg, Bernard. 1969. Recent work in west Africa: New light on the Nok culture. World Archaeology 1(1): 41\u201350.</ref>\n\nThe function of Nok terracotta sculptures remains unknown. For the most part, the terracotta is preserved in the form of scattered fragments. That is why Nok art is best known today only for the heads, both male and female, whose hairstyles are particularly detailed and refined. The statues are in fragments because the discoveries are usually made from [[alluvium|alluvial mud]], in terrain made by the erosion of water. The terracotta statues found there are hidden, rolled, polished, and broken. Rarely are works of great size conserved intact making them highly valued on the international art market. The terracotta figures are hollow, coil built, nearly life-sized human heads and bodies that are depicted with highly stylized features, abundant [[jewellery|jewelry]], and varied postures.\n\nLittle is known of the original function of the pieces, but theories include ancestor portrayal, [[grave marker]]s, and [[amulet|charms]] to prevent crop failure, infertility, and illness. Also, based on the dome-shaped bases found on several figures, they could have been used as finials for the roofs of ancient structures. Margaret Young-Sanchez, Associate Curator of Art of the Americas, Africa, and Oceania in [[The Cleveland Museum of Art]], explains that most Nok ceramics were shaped by hand from coarse-grained clay and subtractively sculpted in a manner that suggests an influence from wood carving. After some drying, the sculptures were covered with slip and burnished to produce a smooth, glossy surface. The figures are hollow, with several openings to facilitate thorough drying and firing. The firing process most likely resembled that used today in Nigeria, in which the pieces are covered with grass, twigs, and leaves and burned for several hours.\n\nAs a result of natural erosion and deposition, Nok terracottas were scattered at various depths throughout the Sahel grasslands, causing difficulty in the dating and classification of the mysterious artifacts. Luckily, two archaeological sites, [[Samun Dukiya]] and [[Taruga]], were found containing Nok art that had remained unmoved. [[Radiocarbon dating|Radiocarbon]] and [[Thermoluminescence dating|thermo-luminescence]] tests narrowed the sculptures\u2019 age down to between 2,000 and 2,500 years ago, making them some of the oldest in Western Africa. Many further dates were retrieved in the course of new archaeological excavations, extending the beginnings of the Nok tradition even further back in time.<ref name=\"BP 2014\">Breunig, P. (2014).

Before money was the main drive of creation of their artworks they used their abilities solely as a sacred craft for display of spiritual pride, religious beliefs and display of customs. Example artworks include the Bamana [[n'tomo mask]]. Other statues were created for people such as hunters and farmers so others could leave offerings after long farming seasons or group hunts. The stylistic variations in Bambara art are extreme sculptures, masks and headdresses display either stylized or realistic features, and either weathered or encrusted patinas. Until quite recently, the function of Bambara pieces was shrouded in mystery, but in the last twenty years, field studies have revealed that certain types of figures and headdresses were associated with a number of the societies that structure Bambara life. During the 1970s a group of approximately twenty figures, masks and TjiWara headdresses belonging to the so-called 'Segou style' were identified. The style is distinct and recognizable by its typical flat faces, arrow-shaped noses, all-over body triangular scarifications and, on the figures, splayed hands.\n\n;Masks\nThere are three major and one minor type of Bambara [[mask]]. The first type, used by the N'tomo society, has a typical comb-like structure above the face, is worn during dances and may be covered with cowrie shells. The second type of mask, associated with the Komo society, has a spherical head with two antelope horns on the top and an enlarged, flattened mouth. They are used during dances, but some have a thickly encrusted patina acquired during other ceremonies in which libations are poured over them.\n\nThe third type has connections with the Nama society and is carved in the form of an articulated bird's head, while the fourth, minor type, represents a stylized animal head and is used by the Kore society. Other Bambara masks are known to exist, but unlike those described above, they cannot be linked to specific societies or ceremonies. Bambara carvers have established a reputation for the zoomorphic headdresses worn by Tji-Wara society members. Although they are all different, they all display a highly abstract body, often incorporating a zig-zag motif, which represents the sun's course from east to west, and a head with two large horns. Bambara members of the Tji-Wara society wear the headdress while dancing in their fields at sowing time, hoping to increase the crop yield.\n\n;Statuettes\nBambara [[statuette]]s are primarily used during the annual ceremonies of the Guan society. During these ceremonies, a group of up to seven figures, measuring from 80 to 130&nbsp;cm in height, are removed from their sanctuaries by the elder members of the society. The sculptures are washed, re-oiled and sacrifices are offered to them at their shrines. These figures \u2013 some of which date from between the 14th and 16th centuries \u2013 usually display a typical crested coiffure, often adorned with a talisman.\n\nTwo of these figures were ascribed great significance: a seated or standing maternity figure called Guandousou \u2013 known in the West as 'Bambara Queen' \u2013 and a male figure called Guantigui, who usually appears holding a knife. The two figures were surrounded by Guannyeni attendant figures standing or seated in various positions, holding a vessel, or a musical instrument, or their breasts. During the 1970s, numerous fakes from Bamako which were based on these sculptures entered the market. They were produced in Bamako.\n\nOther Bambara figures, called Dyonyeni, are thought to be associated with either the southern Dyo society or the Kwore society. These female or hermaphrodite figures usually appear with geometric features such as large conical breasts and measure between 40 and 85&nbsp;cm in height. The blacksmith members of the Dyo society used them during dances to celebrate the end of their initiation ceremonies. They were handled, held by dancers and placed in the middle of the ceremonial circle.\n\nAmong the corpus of Bambara figures, Boh sculptures are perhaps the best known. These statues represent a highly stylized animal or human figure, and are made of wood which is repeatedly covered in thick layers of earth impregnated with sacrificial materials such as millet, chicken or goat blood, kola nuts and alcoholic drinks. They were employed by the Kono and the Komo societies and served as receptacles for spiritual forces, and could, in turn, be used for apotropaic purposes.\n\nEach special creative trait a person obtained was seen as a different way to please higher spirits.\n\n=====Dogon=====\n[[Dogon people|Dogon]] art is primarily sculpture. Dogon art revolves around [[Dogon religion|Dogon religious]] values, ideals, and freedoms (Laude, 19). Dogon sculptures are not made to be seen publicly, and are commonly hidden from the public eye within the houses of families, sanctuaries, or kept with the [[Hogon]] (Laude, 20). The importance of secrecy is due to the symbolic meaning behind the pieces and the process by which they are made.\n\nThemes found throughout Dogon sculpture consist of figures with raised arms, superimposed bearded figures, horsemen, stools with caryatids, women with children, figures covering their faces, women grinding pearl millet, women bearing vessels on their heads, donkeys bearing cups, musicians, dogs, quadruped-shaped troughs or benches, figures bending from the waist, mirror-images, aproned figures, and standing figures (Laude, 46\u201352). Signs of other contacts and origins are evident in Dogon art. The Dogon people were not the first inhabitants of the cliffs of Bandiagara. Influence from [[Tellem]] art is evident in Dogon art because of its rectilinear designs (Laude, 24).\n\nDogon art is extremely versatile, although common stylistic characteristics \u2013 such as a tendency towards stylization \u2013 are apparent on the statues. Their art deals with the myths whose complex ensemble regulates the life of the individual. The sculptures are preserved in innumerable sites of worship, personal or family altars, altars for rain, altars to protect hunters, in market. As a general characterization of Dogon statues, one could say that they render the human body in a simplified way, reducing it to its essentials. Some are extremely elongated with emphasis on geometric forms. The subjective impression is one of immobility with a mysterious sense of a solemn gravity and serene majesty, although conveying at the same time a latent movement. Dogon sculpture recreates the hermaphroditic silhouettes of the Tellem, featuring raised arms and a thick patina made of blood and millet beer. The four Nommo couples, the mythical ancestors born of the god Amma, ornament stools, pillars or men's meeting houses, door locks, and granary doors. The primordial couple is represented sitting on a stool, the base of which depicts the earth while the upper surface represents the sky; the two are interconnected by the Nommo. The seated female figures, their hands on their abdomen, are linked to the fertility cult, incarnating the first ancestor who died in childbirth, and are the object of offerings of food and sacrifices by women who are expecting a child.\n\nKneeling statues of protective spirits are placed at the head of the dead to absorb their spiritual strength and to be their intermediaries with the world of the dead, into which they accompany the deceased before once again being placed on the shrines of the ancestors. Horsemen are reminders of the fact that, according to myth, the horse was the first animal present on earth. The Dogon style has evolved into a kind of cubism: ovoid head, squared shoulders, tapered extremities, pointed breasts, forearms, and thighs on a parallel plane, hairdos stylized by three or four incised lines. Dogon sculptures serve as a physical medium in initiations and as an explanation of the world. They serve to transmit an understanding to the initiated, who will decipher the statue according to the level of their knowledge. Carved animal figures, such as dogs and ostriches, are placed on village foundation altars to commemorate sacrificed animals, while granary doors, stools and house posts are also adorned with figures and symbols.\n\nThere are nearly eighty styles of masks, but their basic characteristic is great boldness in the use of geometric shapes, independent of the various animals they are supposed to represent. The structure of a large number of masks is based on the interplay of vertical and horizontal lines and shapes. Another large group has triangular, conic shapes. All masks have large geometric eyes and stylized features. The masks are often polychrome, but on many the color is lost; after the ceremonies they were left on the ground and quickly deteriorated because of termites and other conditions. The Dogon continue an ancient masquerading tradition, which commemorates the origin of death. According to their myths, death came into the world as a result of primeval man's transgressions against the divine order. Dama memorial ceremonies are held to accompany the dead into the ancestral realm and restore order to the universe. The performance of masqueraders \u2013 sometimes as many as 400 \u2013 at these ceremonies is considered absolutely necessary. In the case of the dama, the timing, types of masks involved, and other ritual elements are often specific to one or two villages and may not resemble those seen in locations only several kilometres distant. The masks also appear during baga-bundo rites performed by small numbers of masqueraders before the burial of a male Dogon. Dogon masks evoke the form of animals associated with their mythology, yet their significance is only understood by the highest ranking cult members whose role is to explain the meaning of each mask to a captivated audience.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nDogonSatimbe1.JPG|Person who wears a Satimbe mask\nDogonWalu 01.JPG|Person who wears a Walu mask, based on an antilope\nMali, dogon, maschera di iena, xx secolo.jpg|Mask based on a hyena; 20th century; [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] (USA)\nPorteMali.jpg|Decorated door in the [[Hogon]] village\nBrooklyn Museum 61.2 Figure of a Seated Musician Koro Player (2).jpg|Figure of a seated musician (koro player); late 18th century; 55.8 x 17.7 x 10.8&nbsp;cm (22 x 7 x 4{{1/4}} in.); [[Brooklyn Museum]] (New York City)\nFigure of a Kneeling Woman MET DP-13314-032.jpg|Figure of a kneeling woman; circa 1500; wood; height: 35.2&nbsp;cm (13{{fraction|7|8}} in.); [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\nFigure- Equestrian MET 1979.206.85 a.jpeg|Equestrian figure; 16th\u201317th century; wood; height: 68.9&nbsp;cm (27{{fraction|1|8}} in.); Metropolitan Museum of Art\nDogonStool.jpg|Stool; possibly late 19th to early 20th century; wood & pigment; [[National Museum of African Art]] ([[Washington D.C.]], USA)\nBrooklyn Museum 1995.171.11a-c Kanaga Mask in Three Pieces.jpg|Kanaga mask in three pieces; 20th century; 108 x 59.1 x 22.9 cm (42{{1/2}} x 23{{1/4}} x 9 in); [[Brooklyn Museum]] (New York City)\n</gallery>\n\n=====Other ethnic groups of Mali=====\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nFemale Figure with Raised Arm MET vs1979 206 64.jpg|Black and white picture of a female figure with raised arm; 15th\u201317th century; wood (ficus, moraceae), sacrificial materials; height: 44.8&nbsp;cm (17{{fraction|5|8}} in.); by the [[Tellem|Tellem people]]; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\nFigura zoomorfa.

Culturally, it is extremely rich. In part, this is because so few people from Burkina have become Muslim or Christian.<ref>Roy, Christopher D. [http://africa.uima.uiowa.edu/topic-essays/show/37 \"The Art of Burkina Faso\"], Art & Life in Africa, University of Iowa.</ref> Many of the ancient artistic traditions for which Africa is so well known have been preserved in Burkina Faso because so many people continue to honor the ancestral spirits, and the spirits of nature. In great part, they honor the spirits through the use of masks and carved figures. Many of the countries to the north of Burkina Faso had become predominantly Muslim, while many of the countries to the south of Burkina Faso are heavily Christian. In contrast, many of the people of Burkina Faso continue to offer prayers and sacrifices to the spirits of nature and to the spirits of their ancestors. The result is that they continue to use the sorts of art that we see in museums in Europe and America.<ref name=\":0\">Roy, Christopher D. ''Art of the Upper Volta Rivers'', 1987, Paris: Chaffin.</ref>\n\nOne of the principal obstacles to understanding the art of Burkina Faso, including that of the Bwa, &nbsp;has been a confusion between the styles of the Bwa, \"gurunsi\", and Mossi, &nbsp;and a confusion of the Bwa people &nbsp;with their neighbors to the west the Bobo people. &nbsp;This confusion was the result of the use by French colonial officers of Jula &nbsp;interpreters at the turn of the century. &nbsp;these interpreters considered the two peoples to be the same and so referred to the Bobo as \"Bobo-Fing\" and to the Bwa as \"Bobo-Oule.\" &nbsp; In fact these two peoples are not related at all. Their languages are quite different, their social systems are quite different, &nbsp;and certainly their art is quite different.&nbsp;In terms of artistic styles the confusion stems from the fact that the Bwa, \"gurunsi'\" and Mossi &nbsp;make masks that are covered with red white and black geometric graphic patterns. &nbsp;This is simply the style of the Voltaic or Gur peoples, &nbsp;and also includes the Dogon and other peoples who speak Voltaic languages.<ref name=\"uiowa\">{{cite web|url=http://www.uiowa.edu/~africart/Bobo_Bwa/index.htm |title=Art &amp; Life in Africa \u2013 The University of Iowa Museum of Art |publisher=uiowa.edu |accessdate=2014-12-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630060732/http://www.uiowa.edu/~africart/Bobo_Bwa/index.htm |archivedate=2013-06-30 }}</ref>\n\n====Ivory Coast====\n{{Main|Culture of Ivory Coast}}\n[[File:Child-soldier-afrika.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[military use of children|Childsoldier]] in the Ivory Coast'', [[Gilbert G.

The Ivorian people use masks to represent animals in [[caricature]] to depict deities, or to represent the souls of the departed.\n\nAs the masks are held to be of great spiritual power, it is considered a taboo for anyone other than specially trained persons or chosen ones to wear or possess certain masks. These ceremonial masks are each thought to have a soul, or life force, and wearing these masks is thought to transform the wearer into the entity the mask represents.\n\n[[Ivory Coast]] also has modern painters and illustrators.

Traditional Ethiopian church art]]\nEthiopian art from the 4th century until the 20th can be divided into two broad groupings. First comes a distinctive tradition of [[Christianity|Christian]] art, mostly for churches, in forms including [[painting]], [[Ethiopian cross|crosses]], [[icons]], [[illuminated manuscripts]], and other metalwork such as crowns.  Secondly there are popular arts and crafts such as textiles, [[basketry]] and [[jewellery]], in which Ethiopian traditions are closer to those of other peoples in the region. [[History of Ethiopia|Its history]] goes back almost three thousand years to the kingdom of [[D'mt]]. The [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] has been the predominant religion in Ethiopia for over 1500 years, for most of this period in a very close relation, or union, with the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Christianity]] of [[Egypt]], so that [[Coptic art]] has been the main formative influence on Ethiopian church art.\n\n[[File:Lalibela Bet Maryam 1 (28397479782).jpg|thumb|upright|The rock-hewn Church of Bet Maryam in Lalibela.]]\nPrehistoric [[rock art]] comparable to that of other African sites survives in a number of places, and until the arrival of Christianity stone [[stela]]e, often carved with simple reliefs, were erected as grave-markers and for other purposes in many regions; [[Tiya]] is one important site. The \"pre-Axumite\" [[Iron Age]] culture of about the 5th century BCE to the 1st century CE was influenced by the [[Kingdom of Kush]] to the north, and settlers from [[Arabia]], and produced cities with simple temples in stone, such as the ruined one at [[Yeha]], which is impressive for its date in the 4th or 5th century BCE.\n\nThe powerful [[Kingdom of Aksum]] emerged in the 1st century BCE and dominated Ethiopia until the 10th century, having become very largely Christian from the 4th century.<ref name=\"Biasio\">Biasio</ref> Although some buildings and large, pre-Christian [[Stele|stelae]] exist, there appears to be no surviving Ethiopian Christian art from the Axumite period. However, the earliest works remaining show a clear continuity with Coptic art of earlier periods. There was considerable destruction of churches and their contents in the 16th century when the country was invaded by Muslim neighbours. The revival of art after this was influenced by Catholic European art in both iconography and elements of style, but retained its Ethiopian character. In the 20th century, Western artists and architects began to be commissioned by the government, and to train local students, and more fully Westernized art was produced alongside continuations of traditional church art.<ref name=\"Biasio\"/>\n\nChurch paintings in Ethiopia were likely produced as far back as the [[Christianity in Ethiopia|introduction of Christianity]] in the 4th century AD,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://smarthistory.org/christian-ethiopian-art/|title=Christian Ethiopian art|date=2016-12-22|work=Smarthistory|access-date=2017-07-27|language=en}}</ref> although the earliest surviving examples come from the church of Debre Selam Mikael in the [[Tigray Region]], dated to the 11th century AD.<ref name=\"teferi 2015 242\">{{citation|first=Dawit|last=Teferi|editor-first=Philip|editor-last=Briggs|title=Ethiopia|chapter=A Short History of Ethiopian Church Art|year=2015|orig-year=1995|location=Chalfont St Peter|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|isbn=978-1-84162-922-3|page=242|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gU_fCgAAQBAJ|postscript= .}}</ref> However, the 7th-century AD followers of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] who fled to [[Axum]] in temporary exile mentioned that the original [[Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion]] was decorated with paintings.<ref name=\"teferi 2015 242\"/> Other early paintings include those from the [[Rock-cut architecture|rock-hewn]] churches of [[Lalibela]], dated to the 12th century AD, and in nearby Geneta Maryam, dated to the 13th century AD.<ref name=\"teferi 2015 242\"/> However, paintings in [[illuminated manuscript]]s predate the earliest surviving church paintings; for instance, the Ethiopian [[Garima Gospels]] of the 4th\u20136th centuries AD contain [[Christian art|illuminated scenes]] imitating the contemporary [[Byzantine art|Byzantine style]].<ref>{{citation|last=De Lorenzi|first=James|title=Guardians of the Tradition: Historians and Historical Writing in Ethiopia and Eritrea|location=Rochester|publisher=[[University of Rochester Press]]|year=2015|isbn=978-1-58046-519-9|pages=15\u201316|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c1WECgAAQBAJ| postscript = .}}</ref>\n\nEthiopian painting, on walls, in books, and in [[icon]]s,<ref>{{Cite book|oclc=848786240 |title=Ethiopian icons: catalogue of the collection of the Institute of Ethiopian studies, Addis Ababa university|editor=Carolyn Gossage|editor2=Stanley Chojnacki|publisher=Skira|year=2000|isbn=8881186462|location=Milano|pages=|language=English}}</ref> is highly distinctive, though the style and [[iconography]] are closely related to the simplified Coptic version of Late Antique and Byzantine Christian art.

''A Contextual Reading of Ethiopian Crosses Through Form and Ritual Kaleidoscopes of Meaning''. (Gorgias Eastern Christian Studies.) St. Gorgias Press.</ref> They are usually [[copper alloy]] or [[brass]], plated (at least originally) with gold or silver. The heads are typically flat [[casting|cast]] plates with elaborate and complex [[openwork]] decoration. The cross motif emerges from the decoration, with the whole design often forming a rotated square or circular shape, though the designs are highly varied and inventive. Many incorporate curved motifs rising from the base, which are called the \"arms of [[Adam]]\". Except in recent Western-influenced examples, they usually have no ''corpus'', or figure of Christ, and the design often incorporates numerous smaller crosses.  Engraved figurative imagery has sometimes been added.  Crosses are mostly either [[processional cross]]es, with the metal head mounted on a long wooden staff, carried in religious processions and during the [[liturgy]], or hand crosses, with a shorter metal handle in the same casting as the head. Smaller crosses worn as jewellery are also common.\n\nEthiopia has great ethnic and linguistic diversity, and styles in secular traditional crafts vary greatly in different parts of the country. There are a range of traditions in textiles, many with woven geometric decoration, although many types are also usually plain. Ethiopian church practices make a great deal of use of colourful textiles, and the more elaborate types are widely used as church vestments and as hangings, curtains and wrappings in churches, although they have now largely been supplanted by Western fabrics. Examples of both types can be seen in the picture at the top of the article.  Icons may normally be veiled with a semi-transparent or opaque cloth; very thin [[chiffon (fabric)|chiffon]]-type cotton cloth is a speciality of Ethiopia, though usually with no pattern.\n\nColourful basketry with a coiled construction is common in rural Ethiopia. The products have many uses, such as storing grains, seeds and food and being used as tables and bowls. The Muslim city of [[Harar]] is well known for its high-quality basketry,<ref>{{cite web|title=Ethiopian Handicraft|url=http://www.ethiopianhandicraft-femseda.org/home3.htm|accessdate=22 June 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701023243/http://www.ethiopianhandicraft-femseda.org/home3.htm|archivedate=1 July 2012}}</ref> and many craft products of the Muslim minority relate to wider Islamic decorative traditions.\n\n====Tanzania====\n{{Main|Culture of Tanzania#Arts}}\n[[File:Modern Makonde carving in ebony.jpg|thumb|Modern [[Makonde people|Makonde]] carving in [[ebony]]]]\nTinga Tinga art has roots in decorating hut walls in central and south Tanzania.

The Makonde are known as master carvers throughout East Africa, and their statuary that can be found being sold in tourist markets and in museums alike. They traditionally carve household objects, figures and masks. Since the 1950s the so-called Modern Makonde Art has been developed.

A carver held relatively high status, which was displayed by an [[adze]] (axe) that he carried over his shoulder. Luba art was not very uniform because of the vast territory which the kingdom controlled.  However, some characteristics are common.

Fang art is characterized by organized clarity and distinct lines and shapes. Bieri, boxes to hold the remains of ancestors, are carved with protective figures. Masks are worn in ceremonies and for hunting. The faces are painted white with black features. Myene art centers around Myene rituals for death. Female ancestors are represented by white painted masks worn by male relatives. The Bekota use brass and copper to cover their carvings. They use baskets to hold ancestral remains. Tourism is rare in Gabon, and unlike in other African countries, art is not spurred on by commerce.\n\n===Southern Africa===\n{{See|Prehistoric art#Southern Africa|San rock art}}\n====Botswana====\n{{Main|Botswana art}}\n{{See also|Culture of Botswana}}\nIn the northern part of Botswana, women in the villages of [[Etsha]] and [[Gumare]] are noted for their skill at crafting [[basket]]s from [[Mokola Palm]] and local [[dye]]s. The baskets are generally woven into three types: large, lidded baskets used for storage large, open baskets for carrying objects on the head or for winnowing threshed grain, and smaller plates for winnowing pounded grain. The artistry of these baskets is being steadily enhanced through color use and improved designs as they are increasingly produced for commercial use.\n\nThe oldest evidence ancient paintings from both Botswana and [[South Africa]].

The most famous Mapungubwe artwork is a tiny golden rhino, known as the [[Golden Rhinoceros of Mapungubwe|golden rhinoceros of Mapungubwe]]. In other graves from Mapengubwe were found objects made of iron, gold, copper, ceramic and glass beads.\n\n=====Southern Ndebele=====\n{{main|Southern Ndebele people#Arts and craft|Ndebele house painting}}\nThe [[Southern Ndebele people]] are famous for the way they paint their houses. Distinct geometric forms against stark, contrasting colours form the basis of the Ndebele style, which encompassed everything from the architecture, clothing and tools of the people. While color has almost always had a role in drawing emotions in art, the Ndebele were one of the first Southern African tribes to utilise a wide array of colours to convey specific meaning as part of their very lives.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\n20150312 Maastricht; University of Maastricht; Murals in Faculty of Business and Economics 1.jpg|Murals in the Ndebele from the [[Maastricht University]] (the [[Netherlands]])\n20171017 Maastricht, collegezaal Tongersestraat 3.jpg|Murals in the Ndebele from the Maastricht University\nApronMeputo-BMA.jpg|A beaded apron or ''meputo''; late 19th-early 20th century; hide, glass beads, metal beads, straw; 46.9 \u00d7 50.8&nbsp;cm (18.5 \u00d7 20 in.); [[Birmingham Museum of Art]] ([[Alabama]], USA)\n</gallery>\n\n===North Africa===\n{{See|Prehistoric art#North Africa}}\n====Egypt====\n{{Main|Art of Ancient Egypt|Ancient Egyptian architecture|Contemporary art in Egypt}}\n{{See also|Culture of Egypt|Egyptian influence in architecture and visual arts}}\nPersisting for 3,000 years and thirty dynasties, the \"official\" [[art of Ancient Egypt]] was centred on the state religion of the time. The art ranged from stone carvings of both massive statues and small statuettes, to wall art that depicted both history and mythology. In [[26th century BC|2600&nbsp;BC]] the maturity of Egyptian carving reached a peak it did not reach again for another 1,500 years during the reign of [[Ramesses II|Rameses II]].\n\nA lot of the art possesses a certain stiffness, with figures poised upright and rigid in a regal fashion. Bodily proportions also appear to be mathematically derived, giving rise to a sense of fantastic perfection in the figures depicted. This most likely was used to reinforce the godliness of the ruling caste.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nNarmer Palette.jpg|Both sides of the ''[[Narmer Palette]]''; circa 3100 BC; [[greywacke]]; height: 63&nbsp;cm (24{{fraction|3|4}} in.); from [[Hierakonpolis]] (Egypt); [[Egyptian Museum]] ([[Cairo]]).

The meeting was attended by President of the United States Franklin Roosevelt, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Winston Churchill, and Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek of the Republic of China. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin did not attend the conference because his meeting with Chiang could have caused friction between the Soviet Union and Japan.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Cairo Conference of 1943: Roosevelt, Churchill, Chiang Kai-shek and Madame Chiang|first=Ronald Ian|last=Heiferman|location=[[Jefferson, NC]]|publisher=[[McFarland & Company]]|year=2011}}</ref>\n\n===Big Three conferences===\n{{see also|List of World War II conferences}}\n[[File:Teheran conference-1943.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Stalin (left), Roosevelt and Churchill at Tehran, Nov. 1943]]\nBritain, the USSR and the US, were in frequent contact through ambassadors, top generals, foreign ministers and special emissaries such as the American [[Harry Hopkins]].

It focused on postwar plans for European boundaries. The Soviets already controlled Poland. The new boundaries of Poland were especially important, with Stalin seeking control of western Belorussia and western Ukraine. Poland was to gain parts of Germany. Stalin promised free elections in Poland under the auspices of a government he controlled. At Roosevelt's strong urging, Stalin agreed to enter the war against Japan three months after the defeat of Germany. It was agreed the USSR would be a member of the United Nations Security Council, with a veto, and Ukraine and Belorussia would be UN members, but not the other 12 Soviet republics. Germany was to be divided into three zones of occupation, and France was also to get a zone. In a decision that became highly controversial, all civilians would be repatriated.<ref>Fraser J.

Stalin met with the new U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] and two British prime ministers in succession\u2014Winston Churchill and [[Clement Attlee]]. It demanded \"unconditional surrender\" from Japan, and finalized arrangements for Germany to be occupied and controlled by the Allied Control Commission. The status of other occupied countries was discussed in line with the basic agreements made earlier at Yalta.<ref>Herbert Feis, ''Between War and Peace: The Potsdam Conference'' (1960).</ref>\n\n===Dumbarton Oaks Conference===\n{{main|Dumbarton Oaks Conference}}\nThe Dumbarton Oaks Conference or, more formally, the Washington Conversations on International Peace and Security Organization was an international conference at which the United Nations was formulated and negotiated among international leaders. The conference was held at Dumbarton Oaks from 21 August 1944 to 7 October  1944. At the conference, delegations from the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, the United States and the Republic of China deliberated over proposals for the establishment of an organization to maintain peace and security in the world.\n\n===San Francisco Conference===\n{{main|San Francisco Conference}}\nSan Francisco Conference was a convention of delegates from 50 [[Allies of World War II|Allied nations]] that took place from 25 April 1945 to 26 June 1945 in [[San Francisco]], [[United States]]. At this convention, the delegates reviewed and rewrote the [[Dumbarton Oaks Conference|Dumbarton Oaks agreements]].<ref>[http://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/ho/pubs/fs/55407.htm The United States and the Founding of the United Nations, August 1941 \u2013 October 1945]</ref> The convention resulted in the creation of the [[United Nations Charter]], which was opened for signature on 26 June.The heads of the delegations of the four sponsoring countries (China, Britain, the United States and the Soviet Union) took turns as chairman of the plenary meetings.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/sections/history-united-nations-charter/1945-san-francisco-conference/index.html|title=1945: The San Francisco Conference|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=24 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Britain \u2013 United States==\n{{Main|United Kingdom\u2013United States relations World War II}}\n{{See also|Lend-Lease|Destroyers for Bases Agreement|Manhattan Project}}\nThough most Americans favoured Britain in the war, there was widespread opposition to American military intervention in European affairs. President Roosevelt's policy of [[Cash and carry (World War II)|cash-and-carry]] still allowed Britain and France to purchase munitions from the United States and carry them home.\n\n[[File:Prince of Wales-5.jpg|thumb|right|Roosevelt and Churchill drafted the Atlantic Charter in August 1941]]\nChurchill, who had long warned against Germany and demanded rearmament, became prime minister after Chamberlain's policy of appeasement had totally collapsed and Britain was unable to reverse the [[German invasion of Norway]] in April 1940. After the fall of France Roosevelt gave Britain all aid short of war. The [[Destroyers for Bases Agreement]] of September 1940, gave the United States a ninety-nine-year lease on strategically located bases in the Atlantic in exchange for the Royal Navy receiving fifty old destroyers to use in anti-submarine warfare. Roosevelt also sold (for cash) munitions that were carried away in British ships, including over half a million rifles, 85,000 machine guns, 25,000 automatic rifles, mortars, hundreds of field guns, with supplies of the necessary ammunition. The British needed these munitions to reequip the soldiers who lost all their arms when Dunkirk was evacuated in June 1940.<ref>W.K. Hancock and M. M. Gowing, ''British War Economy'' (1949) p. 227 [http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/UK-Civil-WarEcon/UK-Civil-WarEcon-9.html online]</ref>\n\nBeginning in March 1941, the United States enacted [[Lend-Lease]] sending tanks, warplanes, munitions, ammunition, food, and medical supplies. Britain received $31.4 billion out of a total of $50.1 billion of supplies sent to the Allies. In sharp contrast to the First World War, these were not loans and no repayment was involved.<ref>Leo T. Crowley, \"Lend Lease\" in Walter Yust, ed. ''10 Eventful Years'' (1947)1:520, 2, pp. 858\u201360. There had been loans before Lend lease was enacted; these were repaid.</ref>\n\nMillions of American servicemen were based in Britain during the war, which led to a certain amount of friction with British men and intermarriage with British women. This animosity was explored in art and film, most particularly [[A Matter of Life and Death (film)#Anglo-American relations|''A Matter of Life and Death'']] and ''[[A Canterbury Tale#Anglo-American (mis)understandings|A Canterbury Tale]]''.<ref>John Reynolds, ''Rich Relations: The American Occupation of Britain, 1942\u201345'' (Random House, 1995)</ref> In 1945 Churchill sent a British fleet to help the United States attack and invade Japan.\n\n===Casablanca conference===\n\n{{main|Casablanca Conference}}\nFrom January 14\u201324, 1943 Roosevelt, Churchill and the Combined Staff met in [[Casablanca]], Morocco. They decided on the major Allied strategy for 1943 in Europe, especially the invasion of Italy and planning for the invasion of France. At Roosevelt's suggestion they agreed on a policy of \"[[Unconditional surrender#World War II|unconditional surrender]].\" This policy uplifted Allied morale, but it also made the Nazis resolve to fight to the bitter end. Roosevelt also tried to establish a working relationship between the two main French allies, Henri Giraud, the French high commissioner in North Africa, and General de Gaulle, leader of the [[Free French]].<ref>Alan F. Wilt, \"The Significance of the Casablanca Decisions, January 1943,\" ''Journal of Military History'' (1991) 55#4 pp 517\u2013529 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1985768 in JSTOR]\n</ref>\n\n==Britain==\n{{see also|Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II}}\nBritain's declaration of war against Germany in September 1939 included the [[Crown colony|Crown colonies]] and [[British Raj|India]], which it directly controlled. The dominions were independent in foreign policy, though all entered a state of war with Germany either immediately after the British declaration of war, or in the days after the declaration was made. The fears in London that South Africa would take the advice of Prime Minister [[J. B. M. Hertzog]] and remain neutral were relieved when the parliament voted 80 to 67 for war, and Hertzog resigned.<ref>Andrew Stewart, \"The British Government and the South African Neutrality Crisis, 1938\u201339,\" ''English Historical Review'' (2008) 23# 503, pp&nbsp;947\u2013972</ref> After the French defeat in June 1940, Britain and its empire stood alone in combat against Germany, until June 1941. The United States gave strong diplomatic, financial and material support, starting in 1940, especially through [[Lend Lease]], which began in 1941. In August 1941, Churchill and Roosevelt met and agreed on the [[Atlantic Charter]], which proclaimed \"the rights of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they live\" should be respected. This wording was ambiguous and would be interpreted differently by the British, Americans, and nationalist movements.\n\nStarting in December 1941, Japan overran British possessions in Asia, including Hong Kong, Malaya, and especially the key base at [[Battle of Singapore|Singapore]], and marched into Burma, headed toward India. Churchill's reaction to the entry of the United States into the war was that Britain was now assured of victory and the future of the empire was safe, but the rapid defeats irreversibly harmed Britain's standing and prestige as an imperial power. The realisation that Britain could not defend them pushed Australia and New Zealand into permanent close ties with the United States.<ref>{{cite book|author=Alan Warren|title=Britain's Greatest Defeat: Singapore 1942|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zosKzAoocu8C&pg=PA295|year=2006|publisher=Continuum|page=295|isbn=9781852855970}}</ref>\n\n===India===\nSerious tension erupted over American demands that [[India]] be given independence, a proposition Churchill vehemently rejected. For years Roosevelt had encouraged Britain's disengagement from India. The American position was based on principled opposition to colonialism, practical concern for the outcome of the war, and the expectation of a large American role in a post-colonial era. However, in 1942 when the [[Indian National Congress|Congress Party]] launched a [[Quit India]] movement, the British authorities immediately arrested tens of thousands of activists, including [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and [[Mahatma Gandhi]], and imprisoned them until 1945. Meanwhile, India became the main American staging base for aid to China. Churchill threatened to resign if Roosevelt pushed too hard regarding independence, so Roosevelt backed down.<ref>Eric S.

Hitler did not believe they would fight in such a faraway hopeless cause, and he invaded Poland on September 1, 1939. Britain and France declared war on September 3, 1939. But there was little they could or did do to help Poland.\n\n====Plans for intervention in the Winter War against USSR====\nThe USSR launched the [[Winter War]] against Finland in November 1939. The Finns made a remarkable defense against the much larger Soviet forces. The unprovoked invasion excited widespread outrage at popular and elite levels in support of Finland not only in wartime Britain and France but also in neutral United States.<ref>Gordon F. Sander, ''The Hundred Day Winter War'' (2013) pp 4\u20135.</ref>  The League of Nations declared the USSR was the aggressor and expelled it. \"American opinion makers treated the attack on Finland as dastardly aggression worthy of daily headlines, which thereafter exacerbated attitudes toward Russia.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Ralph B.

[[Winston Churchill]], as head of the Royal Navy, and French Premier [[Paul Reynaud]] were the chief advocates. It came when there was a military stalemate on the continent called the \"[[Phony War]]\".  Months of planning at the highest civilian, military and diplomatic levels in London and Paris, saw multiple reversals and deep divisions.<ref>Bernard Kelly, \"Drifting Towards War: The British Chiefs of Staff, the USSR and the Winter War, November 1939 \u2013 March 1940.\" ''Contemporary British History'' 23.3 (2009): 267\u2013291.</ref> Finally the British and French agreed on a plan that involved uninvited invasions of neutral Norway, Sweden, Iceland, and Denmark's  Faroe Islands, with the goals chiefly of damaging the German war economy and also assisting Finland in its war with the Soviet Union. An allied war against the Soviet Union was part of the plan.<ref>J. R. M. Butler, ''History of Second World War: Grand strategy, volume 2: September 1939 \u2013 June 1941'' (1957) pp 91\u2013150. [https://archive.org/details/grandstrategy02butl online free]</ref>\n\nThe actual Allied goal was not to help Finland but to engage in economic warfare against Germany by cutting off [[Swedish iron-ore mining during World War II|shipments of Swedish iron ore]], which they calculated would seriously weaken German war industry.  The British Ministry of Economic Warfare stated that the project against Norway would be likely to cause \"An extremely serious repercussion on German industrial output...and would in any case have a profound effect on the duration of the war.\"<ref>Butler, p 97</ref> The idea was to shift forces away from doing little on the static Western front into an active role on a new front. The British military leadership by December became enthusiastic supporters when they realized that their first choice, an attack on German oil supplies, would not get approval but this plan would win strong support. The poor performance of the Soviet army against the Finns strengthened the confidence of the Allies that the invasion, and the resulting war with Russia, would be worthwhile. However the civilian leadership of [[Neville Chamberlain]]'s government in London drew back and postponed invasion plans. The neutrals refused to cooperate.  Meanwhile, Finland was overwhelmed and gave in to Moscow on 13 March 1940 and the plan was postponed. War plans against the USSR were dropped and the new goal was to mine the Norwegian coast to prevent the passage of ships carrying iron ore from northern Norway.  There were more delays and when mining operations finally started on 9 April it was too late\u2014the Germans hours before had invaded Norway and had the upper hand in the [[Norwegian Campaign]].<ref>Erin Redihan, \"Neville Chamberlain and Norway: The Trouble with 'A Man of Peace' in a Time of War.\" ''New England Journal of History'' (2013) 69#1/2 pp 1\u201318.</ref>\n\n====German invasion 1940====\nWhen Germany began its attack on France in May 1940, British troops and French troops again fought side by side, but defeat came quickly. The Royal Navy evacuated 198,000 British and 140,000 French soldiers in the [[Dunkirk evacuation]] in late May/early June 1940. Tens of thousands of tanks, trucks and artillery guns were left behind, as well as all of the radios, machine guns, rifles, tents, spare parts and other gear. The new Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] pledged that Britain would continue to fight for France's freedom, even if it must do so alone.<ref>Gerhard L.

They planned who would control what in postwar Eastern Europe. They agreed to give 90% of the influence in Greece to Britain and 90% in Romania to USSR. USSR gained an 80%/20% division in Bulgaria and Hungary. There was a 50/50 division in Yugoslavia, and no Soviet share in Italy.<ref>Albert Resis, \"The Churchill-Stalin Secret \"Percentages\" Agreement on the Balkans, Moscow, October 1944,\" ''American Historical Review'' (1978) 83#2 pp.&nbsp;368\u2013387 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1862322 in JSTOR]</ref><ref>Klaus Larres, ''A companion to Europe since 1945'' (2009) p. 9</ref>\n\n===Middle East===\n\n====Iraq====\n[[File:Legionnaires guards gladiators.jpg|thumb|left|Gloster Gladiators of British RAF refuel in Iraq, 1941]]\n\nIraq was an independent country in 1939, with a strong British presence, especially in the oil fields.

The regime of Regent [['Abd al-Ilah]] was [[1941 Iraqi coup d'\u00e9tat|overthrown in 1941]] by the [[Golden Square (Iraq)|Golden Square]] pro-Italian army officers, headed by [[Rashid Ali]].

Iran proclaimed neutrality when the war began in 1939. British and Soviet forces [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran|occupied Iran in August 1941]], deposed the Shah, and installed his son [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi]]. Iran, with a largely rural population of 13 million, had oil wells and became a major route for shipping military supplies from the U.S. to the Soviet Union.\n\nAt the [[Tehran Conference of 1943]], Stalin, Roosevelt and Churchill issued the [[Tehran Declaration]] that guaranteed the post-war independence and boundaries of Iran. However, when the war actually ended, Soviet troops stationed in northwestern Iran not only refused to withdraw but backed revolts that established short-lived, pro-Soviet separatist national states in the northern regions of Azerbaijan and [[Iranian Kurdistan]], the [[Azerbaijan People's Government]] and the [[Republic of Kurdistan]] respectively, in late 1945. Soviet troops did not withdraw from Iran proper until May 1946 after receiving a promise of oil concessions. The Soviet republics in the north were soon [[Iran crisis of 1946|overthrown]] and the oil concessions were revoked.<ref>A. H.

As the Statute of Westminster was already in effect in Canada and South Africa, they issued their own declarations of war against Germany in September 1939.

When the European war was declared over, Australia and the US still had a war to win against Japan. MacArthur promoted a policy of \"[[Leapfrogging (strategy)|island hopping]]\" for his American troops while he suggested that the Australian troops should continue clearing and rounding up the Japanese from New Guinea, New Britain, Borneo and Bougainville.<ref>{{cite book|author=Peter Dean|title=Australia 1943: The Liberation of New Guinea|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_VUCAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA27|year=2013|publisher=Cambridge UP|pages=26\u201343|isbn=9781107470880}}</ref>\n\n====Canada====\n{{further|Military history of Canada during World War II}}\nCanada's declaration of war drew criticism from some [[United States non-interventionism|American isolationists]],<ref name=ameriisocan>{{cite book|title=Storm on the Horizon: The Challenge to American Intervention, 1939-1941|first=Justus D.|last=Doenecke|year=2003|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=0-7425-0785-8|page=208}}</ref> with noted American isolationist [[Charles Lindbergh]] attacking Canada for drawing the Western Hemisphere \"into a European war simply because they prefer the Crown of England,\" to independence of the [[Americas]].<ref name=ameriisocan/><ref>{{cite book|title=Canada on the Doorstep: 1939|publisher=Dundurn|year=2011|first=William|last=Raynor|isbn=1-5548-8992-8|page=188}}</ref> However, most American isolationists who were critical of Roosevelt's for assisting the British, were unable to levy the same criticism for assisting Canada.<ref>{{cite book|title=F.

On December&nbsp;11, 1941, Germany and Italy declared war on the United States, which responded in kind. Roosevelt and his military advisers implemented a war strategy with the objectives of halting the German advances in the Soviet Union and in North Africa; launching an invasion of western Europe with the aim of crushing Nazi Germany between two fronts; and saving China and defeating Japan. Public opinion, however, gave priority to the destruction of Japan, so American forces were sent chiefly to the Pacific in 1942.<ref>{{Citation | editor1-first = David B. | editor1-last = Woolner | editor2-first = Warren F. | editor2-last = Kimball | editor3-first = David | editor3-last = Reynolds | displayeditors=1 | title = FDR's world: war, peace, and legacies | year = 2008 | page = 77}}</ref>\n\nIn the opening weeks of the war, Japan had conquered the Philippines, and the British and Dutch colonies in [[Southeast Asia]], capturing [[Singapore]] in February&nbsp;1942. Furthermore, Japan cut off the overland supply route to China. The United States flew supplies to China \"over the hump\" (The Himalayan Mountains) at enormous cost, until a road could be opened in 1945.\n\nRoosevelt met with Churchill in late December and planned a broad informal alliance among the U.S., Britain, China and the Soviet Union. This included Churchill's initial plan to invade North Africa (called [[Operation Gymnast]]) and the primary plan of the U.S. generals for a western Europe invasion, focused directly on Germany ([[Operation Sledgehammer]]). An agreement was also reached for a centralized command and offensive in the Pacific theater called [[ABDA]] (American, British, Dutch, Australian) to save China and defeat Japan. Nevertheless, the Atlantic First strategy was intact, to Churchill's great satisfaction. On New Year's Day 1942, Churchill and FDR issued the \"Declaration by United Nations\", representing 26 countries in opposition to the Tripartite Pact of Germany, Italy and Japan.<ref>James MacGregor Burns, ''Roosevelt: The Soldier of Freedom'' (1970) pp 180\u201385</ref>\n\n==China==\n{{see also|Second Sino-Japanese War}}\nIn 1931 Japan took advantage of China's very weak central government in the [[Warlord Era]] and fabricated the [[Mukden Incident]] in 1931 to set up the puppet state of [[Manchukuo]] in Manchuria. [[Puyi]], who had been the last [[emperor of China]], became \"emperor\" of China again; he was a Japanese puppet. In 1937 the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]] triggered the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. The invasion was launched by the bombing of many cities such as [[battle of Shanghai|Shanghai]], [[Nanjing]] and [[Guangzhou]]. The latest, which began on 22 and 23 September 1937, called forth widespread protests culminating in a resolution by the Far Eastern Advisory Committee of the League of Nations.  The [[Imperial Japanese Army]] captured the Chinese capital city of Nanjing, and committed [[Japanese war crimes|war crimes]] in the [[Nanking Massacre|Nanjing massacre]].  The war tied down large numbers of Chinese soldiers, so Japan set up three different Chinese puppet states to enlist some Chinese support.<ref>David M.

Even the isolationists who opposed war in Europe supported a hard-line against Japan. The outbreak of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] in 1937 saw aid flow into the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]], led by [[Chiang Kai-shek]].<ref>Michael Schaller, ''U.S. Crusade in China, 1938\u20131945'' (1979)</ref>\n\nAmerican public sympathy for the Chinese was aroused by reports from missionaries, novelists such as [[Pearl Buck]], and ''[[Time Magazine]]'' of Japanese brutality in China, including reports surrounding the [[Nanking Massacre]], also known as the 'Rape of Nanking'. Japanese-American relations were further soured by the [[Panay incident|USS Panay Incident]] during the bombing of [[Nanjing]]. Roosevelt demanded an apology from the Japanese, which was received, but relations between the two countries continued to deteriorate. By early 1941 the U.S. was preparing to send American planes flown by American pilots under American command, but wearing Chinese uniforms, to fight the Japanese invaders and even to bomb Japanese cities. The \"[[Flying Tigers]]\" under [[Claire Chennault]] arrived just as the U.S. entered the war.<ref>Martha Byrd, ''Chennault: Giving Wings to the Tiger'' (2003)</ref>\n\nTo augment Chennault's 100 P-40Bs, in May 1941 Washington decided to send 144 Vultee P-48's, 125 P-43's and 66 Lockheed and Douglas medium bombers. The goal was to give China by early 1942, a respectable air force, judged by Far Eastern standards, sufficient to \"(a) protect strategic points, (b) permit local army offensive action, (c) permit the bombing of Japanese air bases and supply dumps in China and Indo-China, and the bombing of coastal and river transport, and (d) permit occasional incendiary bombing of Japan.\"<ref>Romanus and Sunderland.

His Flying Tigers would use American bombers and American pilots, all with Chinese markings. The U.S. military was opposed to his scheme, and kept raising obstacles, but it was adopted by top civilian officials including [[Henry Morgenthau, Jr.]] (the Secretary of the Treasury who financed China) and especially President Roosevelt himself, who made it a high priority to keep China alive.<ref>The official Army history notes that 23 July 1941 FDR \"approved a Joint Board paper which recommended that the United States equip, man, and maintain the 500-plane Chinese Air Force proposed by Currie.

Chiang's beleaguered government was now headquartered in remote [[Chongqing]].

Congress amended the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] and Roosevelt moved to end the [[Unequal Treaties|unequal treaties]]. However, the perception that Chiang's government, with his poorly equipped and ill-fed troops was unable to effectively fight the Japanese or that he preferred to focus more on defeating the Communists grew. [[China Hands]] such as [[Joseph Stilwell]] argued that it was in American interest to establish communication with the Communists to prepare for a land-based counteroffensive invasion of Japan. The [[Dixie Mission]], which began in 1943, was the first official American contact with the Communists. Other Americans, such as [[Claire Chennault]], argued for air power. In 1944, Generalissimo Chiang acceded to Roosevelt's request that an American general take charge of all forces in the area, but demanded that Stilwell be recalled. General [[Albert Wedemeyer]] replaced Stilwell, [[Patrick Hurley]] became ambassador, and U.S.-Chinese relations became much smoother.\n\nAfter World War II ended in 1945, the showdown came between the Nationalists and the Communists in a full-scale [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]]. American general [[George C. Marshall]] tried to broker a truce but he failed. The Kuomintang (Nationalist) military position steadily worsened and by 1949, the Communists were victorious and drove the Nationalists from the mainland onto the island of Taiwan and other islands. [[Mao Zedong]] established the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) in mainland China, while the Republic of China remains in Taiwan to this day.<ref>Odd Arne Westad, ''Decisive Encounters: The Chinese Civil War, 1946\u20131950'' (2003)</ref>\n\n==Soviet Union==\n[[File:Molotov with Ribbentrop.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Soviet foreign minister [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] (left) meets with German foreign minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] at the signing of the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|German\u2013Soviet non-aggression pact]] on 23 August 1939]]\n[[Joseph Stalin#World War II, 1939\u20131945|Joseph Stalin]] controlled the foreign policy of the Soviet Union, with [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] as his foreign minister.<ref>Robert Service, ''Stalin: A Biography'' (2004)</ref><ref>Geoffrey Roberts, ''Molotov: Stalin's Cold Warrior'' (2012)</ref> Their policy was neutrality until August 1939.

The Soviets achieved [[Axis-Soviet partnership|friendly relations with Germany]] in order to carve up Key elements of Eastern Europe, especially Poland and the Baltic states. Following the pact, Germany invaded and quickly defeated Poland; then the Soviets invaded and took control of its preassigned areas of eastern Poland. Both invaders systematically decimated the Polish elite. In the 1940 [[Katyn massacre]], the [[NKVD]] (Soviet secret police) executed 22,000 Polish military and police officers and civilian intelligentsia.<ref>Anna M. Cienciala et al. eds.

Apart from the British Dominions (Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa), no independent nation joined their cause. Britain and France took a defensive posture, fearing German air attacks on cities. France hoped the [[Maginot Line]] would protect it from an invasion. There was little fighting between the fall of Poland in mid-September and the following spring; it was the [[Phoney War]] in Britain or ''Dr\u00f4le de guerre'' \u2013 the funny sort of war \u2013 in France. Britain tried several peace feelers, but Hitler did not respond.\n\nWhen Germany had its hands free for an attack in the west, it launched its [[Blitzkrieg]] against Denmark and Norway, easily pushing the British out. Then it invaded the Low Countries and tricked Britain and France into sending its best combat units deep into the Netherlands, where they became trapped in the [[Battle of France]] in May 1940. The Royal Navy rescued over 300,000 British and French soldiers from Dunkirk, but left behind all the equipment.<ref>Joel Blatt (ed), The French Defeat of 1940 (Oxford, 1998)</ref>\n\n===Vichy France===\n{{main|Foreign relations of Vichy France}}\n\n====Relationships with Germany====\nParis fell to the Germans on 14 June 1940, and the government surrendered in the [[Armistice of 22 June 1940]] with new leader Marshal [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]] (1856\u20131951).  His Vichy regime was authoritarian, Catholic, paternal and anti-Semitic. His charisma and popularity from his heroic role in the First World War strengthened his authority, although he was increasingly too old to pay attention to details. After Germany seized all of Vichy in October 1942, it installed [[Pierre Laval]] as its puppet leaving P\u00e9tain as a helpless figurehead.<ref>Marc Olivier Baruch,  \"Charisma and Hybrid Legitimacy in P\u00e9tain\u2019s \u00c9tat fran\u00e7ais (1940\u201044).\" ''Totalitarian Movements and Political Religions'' 7.2 (2006): 215\u2013224.</ref>\n\nThe armistice included numerous provisions that weakened France, all largely guaranteed by the German policy of keeping 2 million French prisoners of war and workers in Germany as hostages. Vichy France was nominally a neutral country. it never declared war on the Soviet Union or Britain, and was recognized diplomatically by the United States until 1942. Although Vichy France was nominally in control of all of France\u2014apart from Alsace Lorraine\u2014in practice the Germans controlled three-fifths of the country, including the northern and western coasts, the industrial northeast, and the Paris region. The Petain  government relocated to the resort town of in Vichy and controlled the rest From the start, Germany wanted food, minerals, and industrial productions, as well as volunteers to work in German factories. Vichy was allowed to control  its foreign colonies\u2014to the extent it could defend them against the Free French\u2014as well as its fleet, to the extent it could defend it against British naval attacks.  In October 1942, Germany took it all over; the Vichy regime became entirely a puppet of the German occupiers.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H25217, Henry Philippe Petain und Adolf Hitler.jpg|thumb|left|Marshal P\u00e9tain, left, head of Vichy France, shaking hands with Hitler on October 24, 1940.]]\n\nThe small town of [[Montoire-sur-le-Loir]] was the scene of two meetings. On October 22, 1940, [[Pierre Laval]] met with Hitler to set up a meeting on October 24 between Hitler and P\u00e9tain. It ended in a much-publicized handshake between the two, but in fact their discussions had been entirely general and no decisions had been made. Hitler was impressed with Petain's commitment to defending the French Empire.

Leahy]] to Paris as American ambassador. President Roosevelt hoped to use American influence to encourage those elements in the Vichy government opposed to military collaboration with Germany. Vichy still controlled its overseas colonies and Washington encouraged Vichy to resist German demands such as for air bases in Syria or to move war supplies through French North Africa. The essential American position was that France should take no action not explicitly required by the armistice terms that could adversely affect Allied efforts in the war. When Germany took full control, the U.S. and Canada cut their ties with Vichy.<ref>William Langer, ''Our Vichy gamble'' (1947)</ref> by 1942, Germany was demanding that Vichy turnover the Jews for deportation to German concentration camps. Reluctantly at first, then more enthusiastically, Vichy complied. They turned over 80,000 of the 330,000 French and foreign Jews living in Vichy; the Germans killed 77,000.  When Germany tried to seize the  French fleet at Toulon in November, 1942, the French navy scuttled all its ships.\n\n====French fleet====\nBritain feared that the powerful French navy could end up in German hands and be used against its own naval forces, which were so vital to maintaining north Atlantic shipping and communications. Under the armistice, France had been allowed to retain the [[French Navy]], the ''Marine Nationale'', under strict conditions. Vichy pledged that the fleet would never fall into the hands of Germany, but refused to send the fleet beyond Germany's reach by sending it to Britain or to far away territories of the French empire such as the West Indies. Shortly after France gave up it attacked a large French naval contingent in [[Destruction of the French Fleet at Mers-el-Kebir|Mers-el-Kebir]], killing 1,297 French military personnel. Vichy severed diplomatic relations but did not declare war on Britain. Churchill also ordered French ships in British ports to be seized by the Royal Navy. The French squadron at [[Alexandria|Alexandria, Egypt]], under Admiral [[Ren\u00e9-Emile Godfroy]], was effectively interned until 1943.\n\nThe American position towards Vichy France and Free France was inconsistent. President Roosevelt disliked and distrusted de Gaulle, and agreed with Ambassador Leahy's view that he was an \"apprentice dictator.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=David Mayers|title=FDR's Ambassadors and the Diplomacy of Crisis: From the Rise of Hitler to the End of World War II|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wjLKYL3xbmAC&pg=PA160|year= 2012|publisher=Cambridge U.P.|page=160|isbn=9781107031265}}</ref>\n\n====North Africa====\nPreparing for a landing in North Africa in late 1942, the US looked for a top French ally. It turned to [[Henri Giraud]] shortly before the landing on 8 November 1942, but he had little local support. By hapstance the Vichy leader Admiral [[Fran\u00e7ois Darlan]] was captured and supported the Americans. The Allies, with General [[Dwight D.

Darlan was assassinated on 24 December 1942, so Washington turned again towards Giraud, who was made High Commissioner of French North and West Africa.

Its dictator [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar|Salazar]] collaborated with the British and sold them rubber and [[tungsten]] (\"wolfram\").<ref>William Gervase Clarence-Smith, \"The Portuguese Empire and the 'Battle for Rubber' in the Second World War,\" ''Portuguese Studies Review'' (2011), 19#1 pp&nbsp;177\u2013196</ref> In late 1943 he allowed the Allies to establish air bases in the Azores to fight U-boats.

The overtures proved futile. Franco was sympathetic but remained emphatically neutral. However, Spain did need to pay off its heavy debt to Germany. Therefore, Franco did provide various kinds of support to Italy and Germany.<ref>Michael Mazower, ''Hitler's Empire, Nazi rule in Occupied Europe'' (2009) pp.&nbsp;114\u20135, 320</ref> It sold Germany supplies, especially wolfram, the hard-to-find tungsten ore.

Germany had an interest in seizing the key fortress of Gibraltar, but Franco stationed his army at the French border to dissuade Germany from occupying the Iberian Peninsula. Franco displayed pragmatism and his determination to act principally in Spanish interests, in the face of Allied economic pressure, Axis military demands, and Spain's geographic isolation.

At outbreak of war in November between Finland  and the  Soviet Union, Sweden declared \"[[Non-belligerent]]\" to make it possible to support Finland with arms and [[Military volunteer|Volunteers]] in the Winter War. From 13 December to the end of the war, a [[National unity government]] under Prime Minister [[Per Albin Hansson]] and Foreign Minister [[Christian G\u00fcnther]] was formed that included all major parties in the Riksdag.\n\nFrom April 1940 Sweden and Finland was encircled between the Nazi Germany and the Soviet union and subject to both British and German [[blockades]]. In spring-summer 1940 the United States stopped delivery of fighter aircraft to Sweden.\nSweden made concessions to both Allies and Germany. It held that that neutrality and cooperation with Germany were necessary for survival, for Germany was vastly more powerful, concessions were limited and were only made where the threat was too great; neutrality was bent but not broken; national unity was paramount; and in any case Sweden had the neutral right to trade with Germany. Germany needed Swedish iron and had nothing to gain\u2014and much iron to lose\u2014by an invasion.<ref>John Gilmour, ''Sweden, the Swastika, and Stalin: The Swedish Experience in the Second World War'' (2011) pp&nbsp;270\u201371 [https://www.questia.com/library/120075612/sweden-the-swastika-and-stalin-the-swedish-experience online]</ref>\n\nAs a free country, refugees from Finland, Norway, Denmark and the Baltic states fled to Sweden during the war.

The [[Operation Tannenbaum|Germans did make plans]], but never invaded.<ref>Klaus Urner, ''Let's Swallow Switzerland: Hitler's Plans against the Swiss Confederation'' (2001)</ref> Cut off from the Allies, Swiss trade was mostly with Germany, with Swiss banks a favourite place for Nazis to store their loot. The Swiss depended on German permission to import its food and fuel. Smuggling high precision tools and weapons (such as jewel bearings, diamond dies, and chronographs) to Britain took place on a large scale.<ref>Neville Wylie, \"British Smuggling Operations from Switzerland, 1940\u20131944,\" ''Historical Journal'' (2005) 48#5 pp. 1077\u20131102 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4091649 in JSTOR]</ref> Switzerland became a convenient center for spies and espionage.<ref>Stephen Halbrook, ''Swiss and the Nazis: How the Alpine Republic Survived in the Shadow of the Third Reich'' (2010) ch 12</ref>\n\nSwiss banks paid Germany 1.3 billion Swiss Francs for gold; Germany used the Francs to buy supplies on the world market. However much of the gold was looted and the Allies warned Switzerland during the war.

The deal was enhanced with loans of \u00a341 million. An invasion was threatened in 1941 but did not happen and Ankara refused German requests to allow troops to cross its borders into Syria or into the USSR. Germany had been its largest trading partner before the war, and Turkey continued to do business with both sides. It purchased arms from both sides. The Allies tried to stop German purchases of chrome (used in making better steel). Starting in 1942 the Allies provided military aid and pressed for a declaration of war. Turkey's president conferred with Roosevelt and Churchill at the [[Cairo Conference]] in November, 1943, and promised to enter the war when it was fully armed. By August 1944, with Germany nearing defeat, Turkey broke off relations. In February 1945, it declared war on Germany and Japan, a symbolic move that allowed Turkey to join the future United Nations. Meanwhile, relations with Moscow worsened, setting stage for the [[Truman Doctrine]] of 1947 and the start of the Cold War.<ref>Erik J.

Full control allowed the Nazis to achieve their high priority of mass murdering all Jewish population. Although Japan was officially a powerful ally, the relationship was distant and there was little coordination or cooperation, such as Germany's refusal to share the secret formula for making synthetic oil from coal until late in the war.<ref>{{cite book|author=Bernd Martin|title=Japan and Germany in the Modern World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7_jBOpYASMQC&pg=PA280|year=2005|publisher=Berghahn Books|pages=279\u201380|isbn=9781845450472}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-10460, Adolf Hitler, Rednerposen.jpg|left|thumb|<center>Hitler in action</center>]]\nDiNardo argues that in Europe Germany's foreign-policy was dysfunctional during the war, as Hitler treated each ally separately, and refused to create any sort of combined staff that would synchronize policies, armaments, and strategies. Italy, Finland, Romania, and Hungary each dealt with Berlin separately, and never coordinated their activities. Germany was reluctant to share its powerful weapons systems, or to train Axis officers.

On 9 August 1943, Hitler summoned Tsar [[Boris III of Bulgaria]] to a stormy meeting at field headquarters, and demanded he declare war on Russia.

A Greek government-in-exile was formed in Cairo (it moved to London), and Germany set up a puppet government in Athens. The latter attracted numerous anti-Communist elements.\n\nWartime conditions were severe for civilians; famine was rampant as grain production plunged and Germany seized food supplies for its own needs. Malaria became epidemic. The Germans retaliated brutally for sabotage by the [[Greek Resistance]]. Multiple resistance groups organized, but they often opposed each other. They included the [[National Republican Greek League]] (EDES), the [[National and Social Liberation]]  (EKKA). Strongest of all was the Communist [[National Liberation Front (Greece)|National Liberation Front]] (EAM); its military arm, the National Popular Liberation Army (ELAS) had 50,000 soldiers.

Kosovo was given to Albania (then under Italian control). Macedonia went to Bulgaria and Vojvodina was given over to Hungary. Serbia became a German puppet state and was the cockpit of the resistance.  In Slovenia, Germans deported Slovenes to Serbia, enrolled them in the German army, or deported them to Germany to work in war factories and labor camps.

Japan depended on imports from the Allies for 90% of its oil, and the cutoff of oil shipments in mid-1941 left Japan with supplies for only a year or two of serious combat by its warships and warplanes unless it came to terms regarding China, or seized oil fields controlled by Britain and the Netherlands. The latter course meant war, and was urged by army officials who had been bloodied in [[Battles of Khalkhin Gol|border conflicts]] and were reluctant to engage the Soviets. Some admirals and many civilians, including Prime Minister [[Konoe Fumimaro]], believed that a war with the U.S. would end in defeat. The alternative was loss of honor and power. Diplomats proposed political compromises in the form of the \"Amau Doctrine\", dubbed the \"Japanese Monroe Doctrine\" which would have given the Japanese free rein with regard to  China.

On the one hand, it preached the unity of the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]], a coalition of Asian races, directed by Japan, against the imperialism of Britain, France, the Netherlands, United States, and Europe in general.

Other areas were added, and over 800,000 Japanese moved in as administrators.  The nominal ruler was [[Puyi]], who as a small child had been the last Emperor of China.  He was deposed during the revolution of 1911, and now the Japanese brought him back in a powerless role.  Only Axis countries recognized Manchukuo.  The United States in 1932 announced the [[Stimson Doctrine]] stating that it would never recognize Japanese sovereignty.  Japan modernized the economy and operated it as a satellite to the Japanese economy.  It was out of range of American bombers, so its factories continued their output to the end.

It was based in  Nanjing. The Japanese were in full control; the puppet state declared war on the Allies in 1943.  Wang was allowed to administer the International Settlement in Shanghai.

Ultimately, the attack proved a long-term strategic disaster that actually inflicted relatively little significant long-term damage while provoking the United States to seek revenge in an all-out [[total war]] in which no terms short of [[unconditional surrender]] would be entertained.\n\n[[File:Atomic cloud over Hiroshima - NARA 542192 - Edit.jpg|thumb|200px|[[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Atomic cloud over Hiroshima]], 1945]]\nHowever, as Admiral Yamamoto warned, Japan's six-month window of military advantage following Pearl Harbor ended with the Japanese Navy's offensive ability being crippled at the hands of the American Navy in the [[Battle of Midway]].  As the war became one of mass production and logistics, the U.S. built  a far stronger navy with more numerous warplanes, and a superior communications and logistics system. The Japanese had stretched too far and were unable to supply their forward bases\u2014many soldiers died of starvation.

A series of massive raids burned out much of Tokyo and 64 major industrial cities beginning in March 1945 while [[Operation Starvation]] seriously disrupted the nation's vital internal shipping lanes. Regardless of how the war was becoming hopeless, the circle around the Emperor held fast and refused to open negotiations. Finally in August, two atomic bombs and the Soviet invasion of Manchuria demonstrated the cause was futile, and [[Hirohito]] authorized a surrender whereby he kept his throne.<ref>Herbert P.

Starvation or malnutrition-related illness accounted for roughly 80 percent of Japanese military deaths in the Philippines, and 50 percent of military fatalities in China. The aerial bombing of a total of 65 Japanese cities appears to have taken a minimum of 400,000 and possibly closer to 600,000 civilian lives (over 100,000 in Tokyo alone, over 200,000 in Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined, and 80,000\u2013150,000 civilian deaths in the battle of Okinawa).

After unsuccessfully attempting to force territorial and other concessions on the Finns, the Soviet Union invaded Finland in November 1939 starting the [[Winter War]]. Finland won very wide popular support in Britain and the United States.<ref>Kent Forster, \"Finland's Foreign Policy 1940\u20131941: An Ongoing Historiographic Controversy,\" ''Scandinavian Studies'' (1979) 51#2 pp&nbsp;109\u2013123</ref>\n\nSoviet success in Finland would threaten Germany's iron-ore supplies and offered the prospect of Allied interference in the region. The Soviets overwhelmed the Finnish resistance in the [[Winter War]], and a peace treaty was signed in March 1940. It ceded some Finnish territory to the Soviet Union, including the [[Karelian Isthmus]], containing Finland's second-largest city, [[Vyborg|Viipuri]], and the critical defensive structure of the [[Mannerheim Line]].<ref>Max Jakobson, ''The Diplomacy of the Winter War: An Account of the Russo-Finnish War, 1939\u20131940'' (1961)</ref>\n\nAfter the Winter War, Finland sought protection and support from the Britain and Sweden without success. Finland drew closer to Germany, first with the intent of enlisting German support as a counterweight to thwart continuing Soviet pressure, and later to help regain lost territories. Finland declared war against the Soviet Union on 25 June 1941 in what is called the \"[[Continuation War]]\" in Finnish historiography.<ref>Mauno Jokipii. \"Finland's Entrance into the Continuation War,\" ''Revue Internationale d'Histoire Militaire'' (1982), Issue 53, pp&nbsp;85\u2013103.</ref> To meet Stalin's demands, Britain reluctantly declared war on Finland on 6 December 1941, although no other military operations followed. War was never declared between Finland and the United States, though relations were severed between the two countries in 1944 as a result of the [[Ryti\u2013Ribbentrop Agreement]]. The arms-length collaboration with Germany stemmed from a precarious balance struck by the Finns in order to avoid antagonizing Britain and the United States. In the end Britain declared war to satisfy the needs of its Soviet policy, but did not engage in combat against Finland. Finland concluded armistice negotiations with the USSR under strong German pressure to continue the war, while British and American acted in accord with their own alliances with the Soviets.<ref>Tuomo Polvinen, \"The Great Powers and Finland 1941\u20131944,\" ''Revue Internationale d'Histoire Militaire'' (1985), Issue 62, pp&nbsp;133\u2013152.</ref>\n\nFinland maintained command of its armed forces and pursued war objectives independently of Germany.

Under its terms Finland was obliged to remove or intern any remaining German troops on Finnish territory past September 15. This resulted in a military campaign to expel German forces in [[Lapland War|Lapland in the final months of 1944]]. Finland signed a [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|peace treaty]] with the Allied powers in 1947.\n\n==Governments in Exile==\nBritain welcomed governments in exile to set up their headquarters in London<ref>{{cite book|author=Martin Conway and Jos\u00e9 Gotovitch, eds.|title=Europe in Exile: European Exile Communities in Britain, 1940\u20131945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cxN5K9pAG1gC|year=2001|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=9781571815033}}</ref> whilst others were set up in neutral or other allied territory.

Other leaders escaped to France, and later to London, where the [[Polish government-in-exile]] was set up by [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski|General Sikorski]].

During the war about 400,000 Poles joined the underground [[Polish Home Army]], about 200,000 went into [[Polish Armed Forces in the West|combat on western fronts]] in units loyal to the Polish government in exile, and about 300,000 [[Polish Armed Forces in the East#Berling Army: 1943-1945|fought under Soviet command]] in the last stages of the war.<ref>Jerzy Lukowski and Hubert Zawadzki, ''A Concise History of Poland'' (2006)  pp.&nbsp;264\u2013265.</ref>\n\nSince the start of the war the body protested on the international stage against the German occupation of their territory and the treatment of their civilian population. In 1940 the Polish Ministry of Information produced a list of those it believed had been murdered by the Nazis.

Politics were suspended and the government coordinated action with the Allies, retained control of a worldwide diplomatic and consular service, and operated the huge Norwegian merchant marine. It organized and supervised the resistance within Norway. One long-term impact was the abandonment of a traditional Scandinavian policy of neutrality; Norway became a founding member of NATO in 1949.<ref>Erik J.

The Germans captured about 20% of the fleet but the remainder, about 1000 ships, were taken over by the government.  Although half the ships were sunk, the earnings paid the expenses of the government.<ref>Dear and Foot, ''Oxford Companion'' (1995) pp&nbsp;818\u201321</ref><ref>Johs Andenaes, ''Norway and the Second World War'' (1966)</ref>\n\n===Netherlands===\nThe government in 1940 fled to London, where it had command of some colonies as well as the Dutch navy and merchant marine.<ref>John H.

Asser Instituut P99</ref> After the fall of France the Dutch Prime Minister [[Dirk Jan de Geer]] advocated negotiating a separate peace between the Netherlands and the Third Reich. [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina]] fearing that the loss of the [[Dutch East Indies]] to Japan would be a term of any treaty vetoed any agreement. On 3 September 1940 the Queen dismissed her prime minister and replaced him with [[Pieter Sjoerds Gerbrandy]], who worked with Churchill and Roosevelt on ways to smooth the path for an American entry. [[Aruba]] together with [[Cura\u00e7ao]] the then world-class exporting oil refineries were the main suppliers of refined products to the Allies. Aruba became a British protectorate from 1940 to 1942 and a US protectorate from 1942 to 1945. On November 23, 1941, under an agreement with the Netherlands government-in-exile, the United States occupied [[Suriname|Dutch Guiana]] to protect the bauxite mines.<ref>[http://faculty.virginia.edu/setear/students/fdrneutr/Home.html World War II Timeline]</ref>\n\n===Czechoslovakia===\n\nThe [[Czechoslovak government-in-exile]] was an informal title given to the Czechoslovak National Liberation Committee originally created by the former Czechoslovak President, [[Edvard Bene\u0161]] in Paris in October 1939.<ref name=Crampton>Crampton, R. J. ''Eastern Europe in the Twentieth Century \u2014 and after''. Routledge. 1997.</ref> Unsuccessful negotiations with [[France]] for diplomatic status, as well as the impending [[Occupation of France by Nazi Germany|Nazi occupation of France]], forced the Committee to withdraw to [[London]] in 1940. The body was eventually considered, by those countries that recognized it, as the legal continuation of the [[First Republic of Czechoslovakia]].\n\n===Belgium===\n{{main|Belgium in World War II}}\nThe German invasion lasted only 18 days in 1939 before the Belgian army surrendered. The king remained behind, but the government escaped to France and then to England in 1940.  Belgium was liberated in late 1944.<ref>Eliezer Yapou, ''Governments in Exile, 1939\u20131945: Leadership from London and Resistance at Home'' (1998) ch 4 [http://governmentsinexile.com/yapoubelgium.html online]</ref>\n\nBelgium had two holdings in Africa, the very large colony of the [[Belgian Congo]] and the mandate of [[Ruanda-Urundi]]. The Belgian Congo was not occupied and remained loyal to the Allies as a useful economic asset. The government in exile sold 3.4 million pounds of uranium ore from the Congo to the U.S. for the atomic bomb.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jonathan E.

The colonial ''[[Force Publique]]'' also served in other theatres alongside British forces.\n\n===Yugoslavia in exile===\n{{Main|World War II in Yugoslavia}}\nYugoslavia had a weak government in exile based in London that included [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|King Peter]]. However, power inside the country was divided three ways between the Germans and their allies, and two Serbian resistance groups. The royalist anti-Communist [[Chetniks]] under [[Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107]], was nominally under the control of the government in exile. Chetniks were Serbians opposed to the Nazis but sometimes did collaborate with the Germans and Usta\u0161a in their fierce guerrilla battles with the [[National Liberation Army (Yugoslavia)|National Liberation Army]], a Communist-controlled resistance headed by [[Josip Broz Tito]]. Tito's strength grew in 1943, and Mihailovi\u0107 and the monarchists fell far behind. Churchill reversed course in December 1943, ended his support for the forces of Mihailovi\u0107, and backed instead Tito. The government in exile followed suite and supported Tito.<ref>Winston Churchill, ''Closing the Ring'' (vol. 5 of ''The Second World War'') (1952) ch 26</ref> Tito drove out the Germans in 1945, repudiated the government in exile, liquidated the Mihailovic forces. This allowed the formation of a Communist state of Yugoslavia that was independent of Moscow, with Tito in full control.<ref>Walter R. Roberts, ''Tito, Mihailovi\u0107, and the Allies, 1941\u20131945'' (1987).</ref>\n\n===Korea===\nBased in the Chinese city of [[Shanghai]] and later [[Chongqing]] the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea acted as the Korean government-in-exile from 13 April 1919 until the [[Republic of Korea]] was established in 1948.\n\n==List of all War Declarations and other outbreaks of hostilities==\n{{main|Declarations of War during World War II}}\nRegarding ''type'' of war outbreak (fourth column): \n'''A''' = Attack without a declaration of war, '''U''' = State of war emerged through ultimatum, '''WD''' = State of war emerged after formal declaration of war, '''D''' = Diplomatic breakdown leading to a state of war.

The meeting was attended by President of the United States Franklin Roosevelt, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Winston Churchill, and Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek of the Republic of China. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin did not attend the conference because his meeting with Chiang could have caused friction between the Soviet Union and Japan.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Cairo Conference of 1943: Roosevelt, Churchill, Chiang Kai-shek and Madame Chiang|first=Ronald Ian|last=Heiferman|location=[[Jefferson, NC]]|publisher=[[McFarland & Company]]|year=2011}}</ref>\n\n===Big Three conferences===\n{{see also|List of World War II conferences}}\n[[File:Teheran conference-1943.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Stalin (left), Roosevelt and Churchill at Tehran, Nov. 1943]]\nBritain, the USSR and the US, were in frequent contact through ambassadors, top generals, foreign ministers and special emissaries such as the American [[Harry Hopkins]].

It focused on postwar plans for European boundaries. The Soviets already controlled Poland. The new boundaries of Poland were especially important, with Stalin seeking control of western Belorussia and western Ukraine. Poland was to gain parts of Germany. Stalin promised free elections in Poland under the auspices of a government he controlled. At Roosevelt's strong urging, Stalin agreed to enter the war against Japan three months after the defeat of Germany. It was agreed the USSR would be a member of the United Nations Security Council, with a veto, and Ukraine and Belorussia would be UN members, but not the other 12 Soviet republics. Germany was to be divided into three zones of occupation, and France was also to get a zone. In a decision that became highly controversial, all civilians would be repatriated.<ref>Fraser J.

Stalin met with the new U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] and two British prime ministers in succession\u2014Winston Churchill and [[Clement Attlee]]. It demanded \"unconditional surrender\" from Japan, and finalized arrangements for Germany to be occupied and controlled by the Allied Control Commission. The status of other occupied countries was discussed in line with the basic agreements made earlier at Yalta.<ref>Herbert Feis, ''Between War and Peace: The Potsdam Conference'' (1960).</ref>\n\n===Dumbarton Oaks Conference===\n{{main|Dumbarton Oaks Conference}}\nThe Dumbarton Oaks Conference or, more formally, the Washington Conversations on International Peace and Security Organization was an international conference at which the United Nations was formulated and negotiated among international leaders. The conference was held at Dumbarton Oaks from 21 August 1944 to 7 October  1944. At the conference, delegations from the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, the United States and the Republic of China deliberated over proposals for the establishment of an organization to maintain peace and security in the world.\n\n===San Francisco Conference===\n{{main|San Francisco Conference}}\nSan Francisco Conference was a convention of delegates from 50 [[Allies of World War II|Allied nations]] that took place from 25 April 1945 to 26 June 1945 in [[San Francisco]], [[United States]]. At this convention, the delegates reviewed and rewrote the [[Dumbarton Oaks Conference|Dumbarton Oaks agreements]].<ref>[http://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/ho/pubs/fs/55407.htm The United States and the Founding of the United Nations, August 1941 \u2013 October 1945]</ref> The convention resulted in the creation of the [[United Nations Charter]], which was opened for signature on 26 June.The heads of the delegations of the four sponsoring countries (China, Britain, the United States and the Soviet Union) took turns as chairman of the plenary meetings.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/sections/history-united-nations-charter/1945-san-francisco-conference/index.html|title=1945: The San Francisco Conference|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=24 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Britain \u2013 United States==\n{{Main|United Kingdom\u2013United States relations World War II}}\n{{See also|Lend-Lease|Destroyers for Bases Agreement|Manhattan Project}}\nThough most Americans favoured Britain in the war, there was widespread opposition to American military intervention in European affairs. President Roosevelt's policy of [[Cash and carry (World War II)|cash-and-carry]] still allowed Britain and France to purchase munitions from the United States and carry them home.\n\n[[File:Prince of Wales-5.jpg|thumb|right|Roosevelt and Churchill drafted the Atlantic Charter in August 1941]]\nChurchill, who had long warned against Germany and demanded rearmament, became prime minister after Chamberlain's policy of appeasement had totally collapsed and Britain was unable to reverse the [[German invasion of Norway]] in April 1940. After the fall of France Roosevelt gave Britain all aid short of war. The [[Destroyers for Bases Agreement]] of September 1940, gave the United States a ninety-nine-year lease on strategically located bases in the Atlantic in exchange for the Royal Navy receiving fifty old destroyers to use in anti-submarine warfare. Roosevelt also sold (for cash) munitions that were carried away in British ships, including over half a million rifles, 85,000 machine guns, 25,000 automatic rifles, mortars, hundreds of field guns, with supplies of the necessary ammunition. The British needed these munitions to reequip the soldiers who lost all their arms when Dunkirk was evacuated in June 1940.<ref>W.K. Hancock and M. M. Gowing, ''British War Economy'' (1949) p. 227 [http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/UK-Civil-WarEcon/UK-Civil-WarEcon-9.html online]</ref>\n\nBeginning in March 1941, the United States enacted [[Lend-Lease]] sending tanks, warplanes, munitions, ammunition, food, and medical supplies. Britain received $31.4 billion out of a total of $50.1 billion of supplies sent to the Allies. In sharp contrast to the First World War, these were not loans and no repayment was involved.<ref>Leo T. Crowley, \"Lend Lease\" in Walter Yust, ed. ''10 Eventful Years'' (1947)1:520, 2, pp. 858\u201360. There had been loans before Lend lease was enacted; these were repaid.</ref>\n\nMillions of American servicemen were based in Britain during the war, which led to a certain amount of friction with British men and intermarriage with British women. This animosity was explored in art and film, most particularly [[A Matter of Life and Death (film)#Anglo-American relations|''A Matter of Life and Death'']] and ''[[A Canterbury Tale#Anglo-American (mis)understandings|A Canterbury Tale]]''.<ref>John Reynolds, ''Rich Relations: The American Occupation of Britain, 1942\u201345'' (Random House, 1995)</ref> In 1945 Churchill sent a British fleet to help the United States attack and invade Japan.\n\n===Casablanca conference===\n\n{{main|Casablanca Conference}}\nFrom January 14\u201324, 1943 Roosevelt, Churchill and the Combined Staff met in [[Casablanca]], Morocco. They decided on the major Allied strategy for 1943 in Europe, especially the invasion of Italy and planning for the invasion of France. At Roosevelt's suggestion they agreed on a policy of \"[[Unconditional surrender#World War II|unconditional surrender]].\" This policy uplifted Allied morale, but it also made the Nazis resolve to fight to the bitter end. Roosevelt also tried to establish a working relationship between the two main French allies, Henri Giraud, the French high commissioner in North Africa, and General de Gaulle, leader of the [[Free French]].<ref>Alan F. Wilt, \"The Significance of the Casablanca Decisions, January 1943,\" ''Journal of Military History'' (1991) 55#4 pp 517\u2013529 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1985768 in JSTOR]\n</ref>\n\n==Britain==\n{{see also|Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II}}\nBritain's declaration of war against Germany in September 1939 included the [[Crown colony|Crown colonies]] and [[British Raj|India]], which it directly controlled. The dominions were independent in foreign policy, though all entered a state of war with Germany either immediately after the British declaration of war, or in the days after the declaration was made. The fears in London that South Africa would take the advice of Prime Minister [[J. B. M. Hertzog]] and remain neutral were relieved when the parliament voted 80 to 67 for war, and Hertzog resigned.<ref>Andrew Stewart, \"The British Government and the South African Neutrality Crisis, 1938\u201339,\" ''English Historical Review'' (2008) 23# 503, pp&nbsp;947\u2013972</ref> After the French defeat in June 1940, Britain and its empire stood alone in combat against Germany, until June 1941. The United States gave strong diplomatic, financial and material support, starting in 1940, especially through [[Lend Lease]], which began in 1941. In August 1941, Churchill and Roosevelt met and agreed on the [[Atlantic Charter]], which proclaimed \"the rights of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they live\" should be respected. This wording was ambiguous and would be interpreted differently by the British, Americans, and nationalist movements.\n\nStarting in December 1941, Japan overran British possessions in Asia, including Hong Kong, Malaya, and especially the key base at [[Battle of Singapore|Singapore]], and marched into Burma, headed toward India. Churchill's reaction to the entry of the United States into the war was that Britain was now assured of victory and the future of the empire was safe, but the rapid defeats irreversibly harmed Britain's standing and prestige as an imperial power. The realisation that Britain could not defend them pushed Australia and New Zealand into permanent close ties with the United States.<ref>{{cite book|author=Alan Warren|title=Britain's Greatest Defeat: Singapore 1942|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zosKzAoocu8C&pg=PA295|year=2006|publisher=Continuum|page=295|isbn=9781852855970}}</ref>\n\n===India===\nSerious tension erupted over American demands that [[India]] be given independence, a proposition Churchill vehemently rejected. For years Roosevelt had encouraged Britain's disengagement from India. The American position was based on principled opposition to colonialism, practical concern for the outcome of the war, and the expectation of a large American role in a post-colonial era. However, in 1942 when the [[Indian National Congress|Congress Party]] launched a [[Quit India]] movement, the British authorities immediately arrested tens of thousands of activists, including [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and [[Mahatma Gandhi]], and imprisoned them until 1945. Meanwhile, India became the main American staging base for aid to China. Churchill threatened to resign if Roosevelt pushed too hard regarding independence, so Roosevelt backed down.<ref>Eric S. Rubin, \"America, Britain, and Swaraj: Anglo-American Relations and Indian Independence, 1939\u20131945,\" ''India Review'' (2011) 10#1 pp 40\u201380</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Arthur Herman|title=Gandhi & Churchill: The Epic Rivalry That Destroyed an Empire and Forged Our Age|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hdPmzLtU5G4C|year=2008|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|pages=472\u2013539|isbn=9780553804638}}</ref>\n\n===Britain and France===\nIn spring 1939 both Britain and France formally announced they would defend the integrity of Poland. Hitler did not believe they would fight in such a faraway hopeless cause, and he invaded Poland on September 1, 1939. Britain and France declared war on September 3, 1939. But there was little they could or did do to help Poland.\n\n====Plans for intervention in the Winter War against USSR====\nThe USSR launched the [[Winter War]] against Finland in November 1939. The Finns made a remarkable defense against the much larger Soviet forces. The unprovoked invasion excited widespread outrage at popular and elite levels in support of Finland not only in wartime Britain and France but also in neutral United States.<ref>Gordon F. Sander, ''The Hundred Day Winter War'' (2013) pp 4\u20135.</ref>  The League of Nations declared the USSR was the aggressor and expelled it. \"American opinion makers treated the attack on Finland as dastardly aggression worthy of daily headlines, which thereafter exacerbated attitudes toward Russia.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Ralph B.

[[Winston Churchill]], as head of the Royal Navy, and French Premier [[Paul Reynaud]] were the chief advocates. It came when there was a military stalemate on the continent called the \"[[Phony War]]\".  Months of planning at the highest civilian, military and diplomatic levels in London and Paris, saw multiple reversals and deep divisions.<ref>Bernard Kelly, \"Drifting Towards War: The British Chiefs of Staff, the USSR and the Winter War, November 1939 \u2013 March 1940.\" ''Contemporary British History'' 23.3 (2009): 267\u2013291.</ref> Finally the British and French agreed on a plan that involved uninvited invasions of neutral Norway, Sweden, Iceland, and Denmark's  Faroe Islands, with the goals chiefly of damaging the German war economy and also assisting Finland in its war with the Soviet Union. An allied war against the Soviet Union was part of the plan.<ref>J. R. M. Butler, ''History of Second World War: Grand strategy, volume 2: September 1939 \u2013 June 1941'' (1957) pp 91\u2013150.

The British Ministry of Economic Warfare stated that the project against Norway would be likely to cause \"An extremely serious repercussion on German industrial output...and would in any case have a profound effect on the duration of the war.\"<ref>Butler, p 97</ref> The idea was to shift forces away from doing little on the static Western front into an active role on a new front. The British military leadership by December became enthusiastic supporters when they realized that their first choice, an attack on German oil supplies, would not get approval but this plan would win strong support. The poor performance of the Soviet army against the Finns strengthened the confidence of the Allies that the invasion, and the resulting war with Russia, would be worthwhile. However the civilian leadership of [[Neville Chamberlain]]'s government in London drew back and postponed invasion plans. The neutrals refused to cooperate.  Meanwhile, Finland was overwhelmed and gave in to Moscow on 13 March 1940 and the plan was postponed. War plans against the USSR were dropped and the new goal was to mine the Norwegian coast to prevent the passage of ships carrying iron ore from northern Norway.  There were more delays and when mining operations finally started on 9 April it was too late\u2014the Germans hours before had invaded Norway and had the upper hand in the [[Norwegian Campaign]].<ref>Erin Redihan, \"Neville Chamberlain and Norway: The Trouble with 'A Man of Peace' in a Time of War.\" ''New England Journal of History'' (2013) 69#1/2 pp 1\u201318.</ref>\n\n====German invasion 1940====\nWhen Germany began its attack on France in May 1940, British troops and French troops again fought side by side, but defeat came quickly.

However, when the war actually ended, Soviet troops stationed in northwestern Iran not only refused to withdraw but backed revolts that established short-lived, pro-Soviet separatist national states in the northern regions of Azerbaijan and [[Iranian Kurdistan]], the [[Azerbaijan People's Government]] and the [[Republic of Kurdistan]] respectively, in late 1945.

Furthermore, Japan cut off the overland supply route to China. The United States flew supplies to China \"over the hump\" (The Himalayan Mountains) at enormous cost, until a road could be opened in 1945.\n\nRoosevelt met with Churchill in late December and planned a broad informal alliance among the U.S., Britain, China and the Soviet Union. This included Churchill's initial plan to invade North Africa (called [[Operation Gymnast]]) and the primary plan of the U.S. generals for a western Europe invasion, focused directly on Germany ([[Operation Sledgehammer]]). An agreement was also reached for a centralized command and offensive in the Pacific theater called [[ABDA]] (American, British, Dutch, Australian) to save China and defeat Japan. Nevertheless, the Atlantic First strategy was intact, to Churchill's great satisfaction. On New Year's Day 1942, Churchill and FDR issued the \"Declaration by United Nations\", representing 26 countries in opposition to the Tripartite Pact of Germany, Italy and Japan.<ref>James MacGregor Burns, ''Roosevelt: The Soldier of Freedom'' (1970) pp 180\u201385</ref>\n\n==China==\n{{see also|Second Sino-Japanese War}}\nIn 1931 Japan took advantage of China's very weak central government in the [[Warlord Era]] and fabricated the [[Mukden Incident]] in 1931 to set up the puppet state of [[Manchukuo]] in Manchuria. [[Puyi]], who had been the last [[emperor of China]], became \"emperor\" of China again; he was a Japanese puppet. In 1937 the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]] triggered the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. The invasion was launched by the bombing of many cities such as [[battle of Shanghai|Shanghai]], [[Nanjing]] and [[Guangzhou]]. The latest, which began on 22 and 23 September 1937, called forth widespread protests culminating in a resolution by the Far Eastern Advisory Committee of the League of Nations.  The [[Imperial Japanese Army]] captured the Chinese capital city of Nanjing, and committed [[Japanese war crimes|war crimes]] in the [[Nanking Massacre|Nanjing massacre]].  The war tied down large numbers of Chinese soldiers, so Japan set up three different Chinese puppet states to enlist some Chinese support.<ref>David M.

Even the isolationists who opposed war in Europe supported a hard-line against Japan. The outbreak of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] in 1937 saw aid flow into the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]], led by [[Chiang Kai-shek]].<ref>Michael Schaller, ''U.S. Crusade in China, 1938\u20131945'' (1979)</ref>\n\nAmerican public sympathy for the Chinese was aroused by reports from missionaries, novelists such as [[Pearl Buck]], and ''[[Time Magazine]]'' of Japanese brutality in China, including reports surrounding the [[Nanking Massacre]], also known as the 'Rape of Nanking'. Japanese-American relations were further soured by the [[Panay incident|USS Panay Incident]] during the bombing of [[Nanjing]]. Roosevelt demanded an apology from the Japanese, which was received, but relations between the two countries continued to deteriorate. By early 1941 the U.S. was preparing to send American planes flown by American pilots under American command, but wearing Chinese uniforms, to fight the Japanese invaders and even to bomb Japanese cities. The \"[[Flying Tigers]]\" under [[Claire Chennault]] arrived just as the U.S. entered the war.<ref>Martha Byrd, ''Chennault: Giving Wings to the Tiger'' (2003)</ref>\n\nTo augment Chennault's 100 P-40Bs, in May 1941 Washington decided to send 144 Vultee P-48's, 125 P-43's and 66 Lockheed and Douglas medium bombers. The goal was to give China by early 1942, a respectable air force, judged by Far Eastern standards, sufficient to \"(a) protect strategic points, (b) permit local army offensive action, (c) permit the bombing of Japanese air bases and supply dumps in China and Indo-China, and the bombing of coastal and river transport, and (d) permit occasional incendiary bombing of Japan.\"<ref>Romanus and Sunderland.

His Flying Tigers would use American bombers and American pilots, all with Chinese markings. The U.S. military was opposed to his scheme, and kept raising obstacles, but it was adopted by top civilian officials including [[Henry Morgenthau, Jr.]] (the Secretary of the Treasury who financed China) and especially President Roosevelt himself, who made it a high priority to keep China alive.<ref>The official Army history notes that 23 July 1941 FDR \"approved a Joint Board paper which recommended that the United States equip, man, and maintain the 500-plane Chinese Air Force proposed by Currie.

However, the perception that Chiang's government, with his poorly equipped and ill-fed troops was unable to effectively fight the Japanese or that he preferred to focus more on defeating the Communists grew. [[China Hands]] such as [[Joseph Stilwell]] argued that it was in American interest to establish communication with the Communists to prepare for a land-based counteroffensive invasion of Japan. The [[Dixie Mission]], which began in 1943, was the first official American contact with the Communists. Other Americans, such as [[Claire Chennault]], argued for air power. In 1944, Generalissimo Chiang acceded to Roosevelt's request that an American general take charge of all forces in the area, but demanded that Stilwell be recalled. General [[Albert Wedemeyer]] replaced Stilwell, [[Patrick Hurley]] became ambassador, and U.S.-Chinese relations became much smoother.\n\nAfter World War II ended in 1945, the showdown came between the Nationalists and the Communists in a full-scale [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]]. American general [[George C. Marshall]] tried to broker a truce but he failed. The Kuomintang (Nationalist) military position steadily worsened and by 1949, the Communists were victorious and drove the Nationalists from the mainland onto the island of Taiwan and other islands.

The Soviets achieved [[Axis-Soviet partnership|friendly relations with Germany]] in order to carve up Key elements of Eastern Europe, especially Poland and the Baltic states. Following the pact, Germany invaded and quickly defeated Poland; then the Soviets invaded and took control of its preassigned areas of eastern Poland. Both invaders systematically decimated the Polish elite. In the 1940 [[Katyn massacre]], the [[NKVD]] (Soviet secret police) executed 22,000 Polish military and police officers and civilian intelligentsia.<ref>Anna M. Cienciala et al. eds.

Apart from the British Dominions (Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa), no independent nation joined their cause. Britain and France took a defensive posture, fearing German air attacks on cities. France hoped the [[Maginot Line]] would protect it from an invasion. There was little fighting between the fall of Poland in mid-September and the following spring; it was the [[Phoney War]] in Britain or ''Dr\u00f4le de guerre'' \u2013 the funny sort of war \u2013 in France. Britain tried several peace feelers, but Hitler did not respond.\n\nWhen Germany had its hands free for an attack in the west, it launched its [[Blitzkrieg]] against Denmark and Norway, easily pushing the British out. Then it invaded the Low Countries and tricked Britain and France into sending its best combat units deep into the Netherlands, where they became trapped in the [[Battle of France]] in May 1940. The Royal Navy rescued over 300,000 British and French soldiers from Dunkirk, but left behind all the equipment.<ref>Joel Blatt (ed), The French Defeat of 1940 (Oxford, 1998)</ref>\n\n===Vichy France===\n{{main|Foreign relations of Vichy France}}\n\n====Relationships with Germany====\nParis fell to the Germans on 14 June 1940, and the government surrendered in the [[Armistice of 22 June 1940]] with new leader Marshal [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]] (1856\u20131951).  His Vichy regime was authoritarian, Catholic, paternal and anti-Semitic. His charisma and popularity from his heroic role in the First World War strengthened his authority, although he was increasingly too old to pay attention to details. After Germany seized all of Vichy in October 1942, it installed [[Pierre Laval]] as its puppet leaving P\u00e9tain as a helpless figurehead.<ref>Marc Olivier Baruch,  \"Charisma and Hybrid Legitimacy in P\u00e9tain\u2019s \u00c9tat fran\u00e7ais (1940\u201044).\" ''Totalitarian Movements and Political Religions'' 7.2 (2006): 215\u2013224.</ref>\n\nThe armistice included numerous provisions that weakened France, all largely guaranteed by the German policy of keeping 2 million French prisoners of war and workers in Germany as hostages. Vichy France was nominally a neutral country. it never declared war on the Soviet Union or Britain, and was recognized diplomatically by the United States until 1942. Although Vichy France was nominally in control of all of France\u2014apart from Alsace Lorraine\u2014in practice the Germans controlled three-fifths of the country, including the northern and western coasts, the industrial northeast, and the Paris region. The Petain  government relocated to the resort town of in Vichy and controlled the rest From the start, Germany wanted food, minerals, and industrial productions, as well as volunteers to work in German factories. Vichy was allowed to control  its foreign colonies\u2014to the extent it could defend them against the Free French\u2014as well as its fleet, to the extent it could defend it against British naval attacks.  In October 1942, Germany took it all over; the Vichy regime became entirely a puppet of the German occupiers.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H25217, Henry Philippe Petain und Adolf Hitler.jpg|thumb|left|Marshal P\u00e9tain, left, head of Vichy France, shaking hands with Hitler on October 24, 1940.]]\n\nThe small town of [[Montoire-sur-le-Loir]] was the scene of two meetings. On October 22, 1940, [[Pierre Laval]] met with Hitler to set up a meeting on October 24 between Hitler and P\u00e9tain. It ended in a much-publicized handshake between the two, but in fact their discussions had been entirely general and no decisions had been made. Hitler was impressed with Petain's commitment to defending the French Empire.

Leahy]] to Paris as American ambassador. President Roosevelt hoped to use American influence to encourage those elements in the Vichy government opposed to military collaboration with Germany. Vichy still controlled its overseas colonies and Washington encouraged Vichy to resist German demands such as for air bases in Syria or to move war supplies through French North Africa. The essential American position was that France should take no action not explicitly required by the armistice terms that could adversely affect Allied efforts in the war. When Germany took full control, the U.S. and Canada cut their ties with Vichy.<ref>William Langer, ''Our Vichy gamble'' (1947)</ref> by 1942, Germany was demanding that Vichy turnover the Jews for deportation to German concentration camps. Reluctantly at first, then more enthusiastically, Vichy complied. They turned over 80,000 of the 330,000 French and foreign Jews living in Vichy; the Germans killed 77,000.  When Germany tried to seize the  French fleet at Toulon in November, 1942, the French navy scuttled all its ships.\n\n====French fleet====\nBritain feared that the powerful French navy could end up in German hands and be used against its own naval forces, which were so vital to maintaining north Atlantic shipping and communications. Under the armistice, France had been allowed to retain the [[French Navy]], the ''Marine Nationale'', under strict conditions. Vichy pledged that the fleet would never fall into the hands of Germany, but refused to send the fleet beyond Germany's reach by sending it to Britain or to far away territories of the French empire such as the West Indies. Shortly after France gave up it attacked a large French naval contingent in [[Destruction of the French Fleet at Mers-el-Kebir|Mers-el-Kebir]], killing 1,297 French military personnel. Vichy severed diplomatic relations but did not declare war on Britain. Churchill also ordered French ships in British ports to be seized by the Royal Navy. The French squadron at [[Alexandria|Alexandria, Egypt]], under Admiral [[Ren\u00e9-Emile Godfroy]], was effectively interned until 1943.\n\nThe American position towards Vichy France and Free France was inconsistent. President Roosevelt disliked and distrusted de Gaulle, and agreed with Ambassador Leahy's view that he was an \"apprentice dictator.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=David Mayers|title=FDR's Ambassadors and the Diplomacy of Crisis: From the Rise of Hitler to the End of World War II|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wjLKYL3xbmAC&pg=PA160|year= 2012|publisher=Cambridge U.P.|page=160|isbn=9781107031265}}</ref>\n\n====North Africa====\nPreparing for a landing in North Africa in late 1942, the US looked for a top French ally. It turned to [[Henri Giraud]] shortly before the landing on 8 November 1942, but he had little local support. By hapstance the Vichy leader Admiral [[Fran\u00e7ois Darlan]] was captured and supported the Americans. The Allies, with General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in charge, signed a deal with Admiral Darlan on 22 November 1942 in which the Allies recognized Darlan as high commissioner for North Africa and West Africa.<ref>Arthur L.

Darlan was assassinated on 24 December 1942, so Washington turned again towards Giraud, who was made High Commissioner of French North and West Africa. Giraud failed to build a political base and was displaced by the last man with any standing, de Gaulle.<ref>Martin Thomas, \"The Discarded Leader: General Henri Giraud and the Foundation of the French Committee of National Liberation,\" ''French History'' (1996) 10#12 pp&nbsp;86\u2013111</ref>\n\n===Free France===\n{{see also|Free French Forces}}\n[[File:De-gaulle-radio.jpg|thumb|right|General de Gaulle speaking on [[BBC Radio]] during the war]]\n\nFree France was the insurgent French government based in London and the overseas French colonies and led by charismatic general [[Charles de Gaulle]].

The deal was enhanced with loans of \u00a341 million. An invasion was threatened in 1941 but did not happen and Ankara refused German requests to allow troops to cross its borders into Syria or into the USSR. Germany had been its largest trading partner before the war, and Turkey continued to do business with both sides. It purchased arms from both sides. The Allies tried to stop German purchases of chrome (used in making better steel). Starting in 1942 the Allies provided military aid and pressed for a declaration of war. Turkey's president conferred with Roosevelt and Churchill at the [[Cairo Conference]] in November, 1943, and promised to enter the war when it was fully armed. By August 1944, with Germany nearing defeat, Turkey broke off relations. In February 1945, it declared war on Germany and Japan, a symbolic move that allowed Turkey to join the future United Nations. Meanwhile, relations with Moscow worsened, setting stage for the [[Truman Doctrine]] of 1947 and the start of the Cold War.<ref>Erik J.

A main goal was obtaining soldiers from the senior allies, such as Italy and Hungary, and millions of workers and ample food supplies from subservient allies such as [[Vichy France]].<ref>Mark Mazower, ''Hitler's Empire: How the Nazis Ruled Europe'' (2009) ch 9</ref> By the fall of 1942, there were 24 divisions from Romania on the Eastern Front, 10 from Italy and 10 from Hungary.<ref>Gerhard L.

Italy, Finland, Romania, and Hungary each dealt with Berlin separately, and never coordinated their activities. Germany was reluctant to share its powerful weapons systems, or to train Axis officers.

On 9 August 1943, Hitler summoned Tsar [[Boris III of Bulgaria]] to a stormy meeting at field headquarters, and demanded he declare war on Russia. The tsar refused, but did agree to declare war on far-away Britain.

A Greek government-in-exile was formed in Cairo (it moved to London), and Germany set up a puppet government in Athens. The latter attracted numerous anti-Communist elements.\n\nWartime conditions were severe for civilians; famine was rampant as grain production plunged and Germany seized food supplies for its own needs. Malaria became epidemic. The Germans retaliated brutally for sabotage by the [[Greek Resistance]]. Multiple resistance groups organized, but they often opposed each other. They included the [[National Republican Greek League]] (EDES), the [[National and Social Liberation]]  (EKKA). Strongest of all was the Communist [[National Liberation Front (Greece)|National Liberation Front]] (EAM); its military arm, the National Popular Liberation Army (ELAS) had 50,000 soldiers.

Kosovo was given to Albania (then under Italian control). Macedonia went to Bulgaria and Vojvodina was given over to Hungary. Serbia became a German puppet state and was the cockpit of the resistance.  In Slovenia, Germans deported Slovenes to Serbia, enrolled them in the German army, or deported them to Germany to work in war factories and labor camps.

Japan depended on imports from the Allies for 90% of its oil, and the cutoff of oil shipments in mid-1941 left Japan with supplies for only a year or two of serious combat by its warships and warplanes unless it came to terms regarding China, or seized oil fields controlled by Britain and the Netherlands. The latter course meant war, and was urged by army officials who had been bloodied in [[Battles of Khalkhin Gol|border conflicts]] and were reluctant to engage the Soviets. Some admirals and many civilians, including Prime Minister [[Konoe Fumimaro]], believed that a war with the U.S. would end in defeat. The alternative was loss of honor and power. Diplomats proposed political compromises in the form of the \"Amau Doctrine\", dubbed the \"Japanese Monroe Doctrine\" which would have given the Japanese free rein with regard to  China. These proposals were rejected by the U.S.; the Japanese Army now demanded a military solution.<ref>Dorothy Borg, ''The United States and the Far Eastern crisis of 1933\u20131938'' (1964) ch 2</ref><ref>Haruo Tohmatsu and H.

In 1937, the Japanese Army invaded and captured most of the coastal Chinese cities such as Shanghai. Japan took over [[French Indochina]] (Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia), [[British Malaya]] (Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore) as well as the [[Dutch East Indies]] (Indonesia). [[Thailand]] managed to stay independent by becoming a satellite state of Japan. In December 1941 to May 1942, Japan sank major elements of the American, British and Dutch fleets, captured [[Hong Kong]],<ref>Oliver Lindsay, ''The Battle for Hong Kong, 1941\u20131945: Hostage to Fortune'' (2009)</ref> Singapore, the Philippines and the Dutch East Indies, and reached the borders of India and began bombing Australia.

On the one hand, it preached the unity of the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]], a coalition of Asian races, directed by Japan, against the imperialism of Britain, France, the Netherlands, United States, and Europe in general.  This approach celebrated the spiritual values of the East in opposition to the crass materialism of the West.<ref>Jon Davidann, \"Citadels of Civilization: U.S. and Japanese Visions of World Order in the Interwar Period,\" in Richard Jensen, et al. eds., ''Trans-Pacific Relations: America, Europe, and Asia in the Twentieth Century'' (2003) pp&nbsp;21\u201343</ref> In practice, it was a euphemistic title for grabbing land and acquiring essential natural resources.<ref>[[Ronald Spector]], ''Eagle Against the Sun: The American War With Japan'' (1985) pp 42, 62\u201364</ref> The Japanese installed organizationally-minded bureaucrats and engineers to run their new empire, and they believed in ideals of efficiency, modernization, and engineering solutions to social problems.

It was run by local warlords.  The Japanese Army seized control in 1931, and set up a puppet state of [[Manchukuo]] in 1932 for the 34,000,000 inhabitants.  Other areas were added, and over 800,000 Japanese moved in as administrators.  The nominal ruler was [[Puyi]], who as a small child had been the last Emperor of China.  He was deposed during the revolution of 1911, and now the Japanese brought him back in a powerless role.  Only Axis countries recognized Manchukuo.  The United States in 1932 announced the [[Stimson Doctrine]] stating that it would never recognize Japanese sovereignty.  Japan modernized the economy and operated it as a satellite to the Japanese economy.  It was out of range of American bombers, so its factories continued their output to the end.

It was based in  Nanjing. The Japanese were in full control; the puppet state declared war on the Allies in 1943.  Wang was allowed to administer the International Settlement in Shanghai.  The puppet state had an army of 900,000 soldiers, and was positioned against the Nationalist army under [[Chiang Kai-shek]].  It did little fighting.<ref>Gerald E.

Ultimately, the attack proved a long-term strategic disaster that actually inflicted relatively little significant long-term damage while provoking the United States to seek revenge in an all-out [[total war]] in which no terms short of [[unconditional surrender]] would be entertained.\n\n[[File:Atomic cloud over Hiroshima - NARA 542192 - Edit.jpg|thumb|200px|[[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Atomic cloud over Hiroshima]], 1945]]\nHowever, as Admiral Yamamoto warned, Japan's six-month window of military advantage following Pearl Harbor ended with the Japanese Navy's offensive ability being crippled at the hands of the American Navy in the [[Battle of Midway]].  As the war became one of mass production and logistics, the U.S. built  a far stronger navy with more numerous warplanes, and a superior communications and logistics system. The Japanese had stretched too far and were unable to supply their forward bases\u2014many soldiers died of starvation. Japan built warplanes in large quantity but the quality plunged, and the performance of poorly trained pilots spiraled downward.<ref>Eric M Bergerud, ''Fire In The Sky: The Air War In The South Pacific'' (2001)</ref> The Imperial Navy lost a series of major battles, from Midway (1942) to the Philippine Sea (1944) and Leyte Gulf (1945), which put American long-range B-29 bombers in range. A series of massive raids burned out much of Tokyo and 64 major industrial cities beginning in March 1945 while [[Operation Starvation]] seriously disrupted the nation's vital internal shipping lanes. Regardless of how the war was becoming hopeless, the circle around the Emperor held fast and refused to open negotiations. Finally in August, two atomic bombs and the Soviet invasion of Manchuria demonstrated the cause was futile, and [[Hirohito]] authorized a surrender whereby he kept his throne.<ref>Herbert P. Bix, ''Hirohito and the making of modern Japan'' (2001)  pp. 487\u201332</ref>\n\n====Deaths====\nTotal Japanese military fatalities between 1937 and 1945 were 2.1 million; most came in the last year of the war. Starvation or malnutrition-related illness accounted for roughly 80 percent of Japanese military deaths in the Philippines, and 50 percent of military fatalities in China. The aerial bombing of a total of 65 Japanese cities appears to have taken a minimum of 400,000 and possibly closer to 600,000 civilian lives (over 100,000 in Tokyo alone, over 200,000 in Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined, and 80,000\u2013150,000 civilian deaths in the battle of Okinawa). Civilian death among settlers who died attempting to return to Japan from Manchuria in the winter of 1945 were probably around 100,000.<ref>John Dower  \"Lessons from Iwo Jima\".

Finland before 1918 had been a province of Russia, and many Finnish speakers lived in neighboring parts of Russia. After unsuccessfully attempting to force territorial and other concessions on the Finns, the Soviet Union invaded Finland in November 1939 starting the [[Winter War]]. Finland won very wide popular support in Britain and the United States.<ref>Kent Forster, \"Finland's Foreign Policy 1940\u20131941: An Ongoing Historiographic Controversy,\" ''Scandinavian Studies'' (1979) 51#2 pp&nbsp;109\u2013123</ref>\n\nSoviet success in Finland would threaten Germany's iron-ore supplies and offered the prospect of Allied interference in the region. The Soviets overwhelmed the Finnish resistance in the [[Winter War]], and a peace treaty was signed in March 1940. It ceded some Finnish territory to the Soviet Union, including the [[Karelian Isthmus]], containing Finland's second-largest city, [[Vyborg|Viipuri]], and the critical defensive structure of the [[Mannerheim Line]].<ref>Max Jakobson, ''The Diplomacy of the Winter War: An Account of the Russo-Finnish War, 1939\u20131940'' (1961)</ref>\n\nAfter the Winter War, Finland sought protection and support from the Britain and Sweden without success. Finland drew closer to Germany, first with the intent of enlisting German support as a counterweight to thwart continuing Soviet pressure, and later to help regain lost territories. Finland declared war against the Soviet Union on 25 June 1941 in what is called the \"[[Continuation War]]\" in Finnish historiography.<ref>Mauno Jokipii. \"Finland's Entrance into the Continuation War,\" ''Revue Internationale d'Histoire Militaire'' (1982), Issue 53, pp&nbsp;85\u2013103.</ref> To meet Stalin's demands, Britain reluctantly declared war on Finland on 6 December 1941, although no other military operations followed. War was never declared between Finland and the United States, though relations were severed between the two countries in 1944 as a result of the [[Ryti\u2013Ribbentrop Agreement]]. The arms-length collaboration with Germany stemmed from a precarious balance struck by the Finns in order to avoid antagonizing Britain and the United States. In the end Britain declared war to satisfy the needs of its Soviet policy, but did not engage in combat against Finland. Finland concluded armistice negotiations with the USSR under strong German pressure to continue the war, while British and American acted in accord with their own alliances with the Soviets.<ref>Tuomo Polvinen, \"The Great Powers and Finland 1941\u20131944,\" ''Revue Internationale d'Histoire Militaire'' (1985), Issue 62, pp&nbsp;133\u2013152.</ref>\n\nFinland maintained command of its armed forces and pursued war objectives independently of Germany.
