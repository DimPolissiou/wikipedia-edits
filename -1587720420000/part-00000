Recent genetic research suggests it is closely related to the [[wattlebird]]s.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nFirst described by the English naturalist [[George Shaw]] in 1794, the regent honeyeater was moved to ''[[Anthochaera]]'' in 1827 by the naturalists [[Nicholas Aylward Vigors]] and [[Thomas Horsfield]].{{sfn|Vigors|Horsfield|1827|pp=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/778569 320-321]}} It was known as ''Xanthomyza phrygia'' for many years, the genus erected by [[William John Swainson]] in 1837. DNA analysis shows that its ancestry is in fact nested within the wattlebird genus ''[[Anthochaera]]''. The ancestor of the regent honeyeater split from a lineage that gave rise to the [[red wattlebird|red]] and [[yellow wattlebird]]s.

Following an overhaul of the world rankings it is the first season where the tariffs are based on prize money. Rather than being awarded points according to tariffs preset by the governing body as in previous seasons, the players are now ranked by their prize money earnings in tournaments that carry ranking status. The only exception to this is when a player loses their first match: for the 2012/2013 and 2013/2014 seasons only half the money earned for the event counts towards the player's ranking,<ref name=\"2013/2014 points schedule\">{{Cite web |work=World Snooker |title=Indicative Prize Money Rankings Schedule 2013/2014 season |date=8 May 2013 |publisher=[[World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association]] |url=http://www.worldsnooker.com/staticFiles/5e/bc/0,,13165~179294,00.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=15 May 2014}}</ref> and for the 2014/2015 season a player will not receive any points at all for that tournament.<ref name=\"2014/2015 points schedule\"/> Due to the transition to the new ranking system, the start ranks of the 2014/2015 season for the top 64 players are incongruent with the ranks of the players at the end of the previous season.\n\nThe [[Snooker world rankings 2014/2015|rankings at the start of 2014/2015 season]] are determined by prize money earned in the [[Snooker world ranking points 2012/2013|2012/2013]] and [[Snooker world ranking points 2013/2014|2013/2014]] seasons and updated after every tournament carrying ranking status. As points are earned from tournaments throughout the current season, the points from the corresponding tournaments from two seasons previous are dropped. The rankings set the official seedings at the start of the season and at six further stages. The total points accumulated by the cut-off dates for the revised seedings are based on all the points up to that date in the 2014/2015 season, all of the points from the 2013/2014 season, and the points from the 2012/2013 season that have not yet been dropped.

The total points from the [[Snooker world ranking points 2011/2012|2011/2012]] and [[Snooker world ranking points 2012/2013|2012/2013]] seasons set the [[Snooker world rankings 2013/2014|rankings at the start of 2013/2014 season]] and are updated after every tournament carrying ranking points. As points are accrued from tournaments in the current season, the points from the corresponding tournaments from two seasons ago are dropped. The rankings set the official seedings at the start of the season and at six further points during the season. The total points accumulated by the cut-off dates for the revised seedings are based on all the points up to that date in the 2013/2014 season, all of the points from the 2012/2013 season, and the points from the 2011/2012 season that have not yet been dropped.\n{{TOC right}}\n\n== Seeding revisions ==\n<ref>{{Cite web |title=2013/2014 World Ranking List \u2013 Seeding Cut Off Points |work=World Snooker |publisher=[[World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association]] |url=http://www.worldsnooker.com/staticFiles/6c/bc/0,,13165~179308,00.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=15 May 2013}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!

Two instances of regional variation in these phonemes have been observed. These are {{IPA|/v/}} becoming {{IPA|/\u03b2/}}, and {{IPA|/\u00f0/}} becoming {{IPA|/z/}}.\n\n==Morphology==\n\n===Pronominal systems===\nLengo has five sets of [[Pronouns|pronominal forms]]. These are emphatic, subject reference, object, direct possessor, and indirect possessor. These distinguish maximally between four [[Grammatical person|persons]] (first person inclusive and exclusive, second, and third person), and four [[Grammatical number|numbers]] (singular, plural, dual, and paucal). There is no [[grammatical gender]] distinction, but there is an [[animacy]] distinction in the object paradigm. Two further uses of these pronominal forms occur - a [[reflexive pronoun]], and a set of [[Interrogative word|interrogative pronouns]].{{sfn|Unger|2008|pp=27-29}}\n\nThe dual and paucal forms are derived from the plural forms by the addition of '''ko-''' and '''tu-''' respectively.\nThe dual forms are used only to indicate ''''two and only two'''', whilst the plural and paucal forms mean ''''two or more'''' and ''''three or more'''' respectively. First person exclusive excludes the addresse(s).\n\n====Emphatic pronouns====\nThe emphatic pronoun in Lengo is optional, and can occur in combination with obligatory pronouns that may occur with subject or object function. It can also appear without other pronouns. It is used to emphasize the semantic role of a noun in a clause.{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=29}}\n \n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n! {{sfn|Unger|2008|p=29}}\n!

It is obligatory in any main clause, but can be excepted in subordinate clauses. It is optional in imperative sentences.{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=34}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n! {{sfn|Unger|2008|p=37}}\n!

''''thi'''' is used if the reference is human, and ''''tha'''' if the reference is non-human.{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=45}}\n\n'''Relative use:'''\n:{| \n| (11) || ''na'' || ''tinoni'' || ''ketha'' || ''a''' thi''''' || ''ga'' || ''deni'' || ''ba'' || ''k-e'' || ''mai'' || ''lau-a'' || ''pile-a'' || ''na'' || ''vanga'' || ''de''\n|-\n| ||<small>ART</small>||<small>person</small>||<small>different</small>||<small>ART REL</small>||<small>there</small>||<small>DEM</small>||<small>FUT</small>||<small>IRR-3SG</small>||<small>come</small>||<small>take-o:3SG</small>||<small>little.bit-o:3SG</small>||<small>ART</small>||<small>food</small>||<small>DEM</small>||\n|-\n| ||colspan=\"10\"| \"a different person who is over there will come take a bit of this food.\"{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=45}}\n|}\n<br />\n'''Interrogative use:'''\n:{| \n| (12) || ''na'' || '''''tha''''' || ''t-o'' || ''goni-a?''\n|-\n| ||<small>ART</small>||<small>INT</small>||<small>RL-3SG</small>||<small>do-o:3SG</small>\n|-\n| ||colspan=\"4\"|\"What are you doing?\"{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=46}}\n|}\n\n==Negation==\nThere are several ways to indicate negation in Lengo.\n\nThere is the discontinuous morpheme ''mo'' '<small>NEG</small>', which surrounds the verb being negated. There are three modals which can appear in the serial verb construction and are negative (''teigha''), prohibitive (''tabu'') or non-volitive (''kou''). Lastly, there is the auxiliary ''boro'' 'impossible <small>FUT</small>', which is sometimes glossed as '<small>NEG</small>' and can negate the verb.\n\nThe ''mo ... mo'' '<small>NEG ... NEG</small>' structure can also be combined with ''teigha'' '<small>NEG</small>' to create a double negative, which carries the meaning of a strong affirmative.{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=137}}\n\n===Discontinuous morpheme ''mo ... mo''===\nThe grammatical negator, the ''mo ... mo'' '<small>NEG ... NEG</small>' structure, is the only instance of a 'discontinuous' morpheme in Lengo. The morpheme ''mo'' appears both before and after the verb being negated.{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=137}} The basic structure of this construction is ''mo V mo'', as seen in (13) and (14):\n\n:{|\n| (13) || '''''Mo''''' || ''ole'' || '''''mo'''''.\n|-\n|      ||<small>NEG</small>|| walk ||<small>NEG</small>\n|-\n|      ||colspan=\"3\"|'Don't walk.'{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=138}}\n|}\n:{|\n| (14) || '''''Mo''''' || ''thaghata'' || ''leo'' || '''''mo'''''. \n|-\n|      ||<small>NEG</small>|| bad || inside ||<small>NEG</small>\n|-\n|      ||colspan=\"4\"|'Don't worry.'{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=138}}\n|}\n\nA variant of this construction is ''mo ... mo'''a''''', as seen in (15).\n\n:{|\n| (15) || ''ko'' || '''''mo''''' || ''lubathia'' || '''''moa''''' || ''pe'' || ''dea'' \n|-\n|      ||2<small>SG</small>||<small>NEG</small>||let.3<small>SG</small>||<small>NEG</small>||or.3<small>SG</small>|| go \n|-\n|      ||colspan=\"6\"|'Don't let it out (release it) or it will run away.'{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=201}}\n|}\n\nNote that although all examples presented by Unger show ''mo ... mo'' '<small>NEG ... NEG</small>' used for a negative imperative, it should not be assumed that this construction is exclusive to a particular sentence structure. More examples are needed for a satisfactory conclusion.\n\nRegardless, ''mo ... mo'' is an uncommon negator in Lengo. Much more frequently used is the modal ''teigha'' '<small>NEG</small>'.\n\n===Modals===\nLengo has a 'serial verb construction'. The various types of serial verb construction identified are directional, sequential, causative, manner, ambient, comitative, dative, instrumental and modal.{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=141}} The basic structure of a modal serial verb construction is as follows:\n\n:V + ''na'' V(-O){{sfn|Unger|2008|p=141}}\n\nThe first verb is the modal verb, and the second verb follows an article (always ''na''). This second verb is treated somewhat like an infinitive.{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=159}} Lengo has five modal verbs; of these, three are used to create negative constructions. These three are:{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=158}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n! Modal\n! Meaning\n|-\n| ''teigha''\n| negative\n|-\n| ''tabu''\n| prohibitive\n|-\n| ''kou''\n| non-volitive\n|}\n\n====Negative ''teigha''====\nOf all the ways to express negation in Lengo, the modal ''teigha'' '<small>NEG</small>' is the most versatile and often used.{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=161}} It can be used to negate verbs in statements, like in (16):\n\n:{|\n| (16) || ''ami-ko'' || '''''teigha''''' || ''na'' || ''ta~tavu'' || ''thai-a'' || ''na'' || ''kei'' \n|-\n|      || 1<small>EX.PL-DU</small>||<small>NEG</small>||<small>ART</small>||<small>RDP</small>~find ||'arrive.at'-o:3<small>SG</small>||<small>ART</small>||basket\n|-\n|      ||colspan=\"7\"|'we couldn't find the basket'{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=161}}\n|}\n\nIn (17) and (18), ''teigha'' appears at the very beginning of the serial verb construction, and the realis locative ''t-i'' appears between the negator and the article ''na''. The entire serial verb construction is negated by ''teigha''.\n\n:{|\n| (17) || ''Ba'' || ''k-u'' || '''''teigha''''' || ''t-i'' || ''na'' || ''mono'' || ''varongo'' || ''i'' || ''vanua.''\n|-\n|      || <small>FUT</small> || <small>IRR</small>-1<small>SG</small> || <small>NEG</small> || <small>RL</small>-<small>LOC</small> || <small>ART</small> || stay || quiet || <small>LOC</small> || village\n|-\n|      ||colspan=\"9\"|'I really won't be sitting around in the village.'{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=151}}\n|}\n:{|\n| (18) || ''E'' || '''''teigha''''' || ''t-i'' || ''na'' || ''mono'' || ''varongo!''\n|-\n|      || 3<small>SG</small> || <small>NEG</small> || <small>RL</small>-<small>LOC</small> || <small>ART</small> || stay || quiet\n|-\n|      ||colspan=\"6\"|'He simply cannot be still!'{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=161}}\n|}\n\nSometimes the construction ''teigha na'' undergoes elision and is shortened to ''tena'', like in (19):\n\n:{|\n| (19) || ''\"gami || '''''tena''''' || || ''agri'' || ''ighami,\"'' || ''gi'' || ''gea'' || ''ena'' \n|-\n|      || g-ami || teigha || na || agri || ighami || g-i || gea || ena \n|-\n|      ||<small>PFCT</small>-1<small>EX.PL</small>||<small>NEG</small>||<small>ART</small>|| agree ||<small>EP</small>:1<small>EX.PL</small>||<small>PFCT-LOC</small>||<small>EP</small>:3<small>SG||3<small>SG</small>:stay\n|-\n|      || colspan=\"8\"|'\"we don't agree,\" they said'{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=161}}\n|}\n\nIt is important to note that this shortened form ''tena'' '<small>NEG</small>' should not be confused with ''tena'' '<small>LOC</small>'. Refer to example (20), which shows both homophones in use: the first being the locative and the second (bolded) being the combined modal and article.\n\n:{|\n| (20) || ''tangomana'' || ''tugua'' || ''tena'' || ''bona'' || ''deni.'' || ''E.'' ||colspan=\"2\"| '''''tena''''' || ''tuaghai.'' || ''Geia'' || ''po.'' || ''Taigu.''\n|-\n|      || tangomana || tugu-a || tena || bona || deni || e || teigha || na || tuaghai || geia || po || taigu\n|-\n|      || possible || story-o:3<small>SG</small> || <small>LOC</small> || time || <small>DEM</small> || 3<small>SG</small> || <small>NEG</small> || <small>ART</small> || long || <small>EP</small>:3<small>SG</small> || <small>LIM</small> || thank.you\n|-\n|      ||colspan=\"12\"|'That just the story I am able to tell at this time. It's not long. That's it. Thank you.'{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=230}}\n|}\n\n''Teigha'' is flexible and can be used to create negative polar questions and answer polar questions, as in examples (21), (22) and (23).\n\nExample (21) is a negative polar question which can be answered with either ''eo'' 'yes' or ''teigha'' 'no'. Answering with ''eo'' would mean 'yes, I have '''not''' seen your basket', whereas answering with ''teigha'' would mean 'no, I have seen it'.{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=189}}\n\nIn example (22), ''teigha'' is used to answer a polar question in the negative. In (23), ''teigha'' is modified by an adverbial, ''vata'' 'continue'.\n\n:{|\n| (21) || ''o'' || '''''teigha''''' || ''na'' || ''bere'' || ''na'' || ''kei-gu?''\n|-\n|      || 2<small>SG</small> || <small>NEG</small> || <small>ART</small> || see || <small>ART</small> || basket-<small>PS</small>:1<small>SG</small>\n|-\n|      || colspan=\"6\"|'you haven't seen my basket?'{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=189}}\n|}\n:{|\n| (22) || ''O'' || ''bo'' || ''dea'' || ''i'' || ''leghai?'' || '''''Teigha.'''''\n|-\n|      || 2<small>SG</small> || <small>IMPF</small> || go || <small>LOC</small> || garden || <small>NEG</small>\n|-\n|      || colspan=\"5\"|'Are you going to the garden?'|| 'No.'{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=162}}\n|}\n:{|\n| (23) || ''A'' || ''P.'' || ''t-e'' || ''mai?'' || '''''Teigha''''' || ''vata.''\n|-\n|      || <small>ART</small> || P || <small>RL</small>-3<small>SG</small> || come || <small>NEG</small> || continue\n|-\n|      || colspan=\"4\"|'Has P. come?' ||colspan=\"2\"|'Not yet.'{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=163}}\n|}\n\nIn (24), ''o teigha'' 'or <small>NEG</small>' is added to the end of the sentence to create an alternative question.\n\n:{|\n| (24) || ''Ba'' || ''k-o'' || ''dea'' || ''o'' || '''''teigha'''?'' \n|-\n|      || <small>FUT</small> || <small>IRR</small>-2<small>SG</small> || go || or || <small>NEG</small> \n|-\n|      || colspan=\"5\" |'Are you going or not?'{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=162}}\n|}\n\nA content question can also be answered with ''teigha'', as in (25).\n\n:{|\n| (25) || ''E'' || ''ngitha'' || ''na'' || ''igha'' || ''t-o'' || ''lavi?'' || '''''Teigha.'''''\n|-\n|      || 3<small>SG</small> || how.many || <small>ART</small> || fish || <small>RL</small>-2<small>SG</small> || take || <small>NEG</small>\n|-\n|      || colspan=\"6\"|'How many fish did you catch?' || 'None.'{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=162}}\n|}\n\n====Prohibitive ''tabu''====\nThe word ''tabu'' 'prohibitive (with consequences); forbidden' is another common way of forming a negative. It is often used by parents who are correcting their children.{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=163}} As with ''teigha'' 'no/none', a clause could consist of the single word ''Tabu!'' 'Don't!'{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=76}} The basic structure is the same as with other modals: the first verb is the modal, and it is followed by the article ''na'' and the second verb.\n\nIn (26), the consequence of disobeying is explicitly addressed. In (27), the article ''na'' is omitted, and the consequence of 'or else ...' is implied.\n\n:{|\n| (26) || '''''Tabu''''' || ''na'' || ''lavi-a'' || ''na'' || ''ghau:'' || ''b-e'' || ''ghado-gho''\n|-\n|      || <small>NEG</small> || <small>ART</small> || grab-o:3<small>SG</small> || <small>ART</small> || knife || <small>APPR</small>-3<small>SG</small> || pierce-o:2<small>SG</small>\n|-\n|      || colspan=\"7\"|'Don't grab the knife: no good it cuts you!'{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=163}}\n|}\n:{|\n| (27) || '''''Tabu''''' || ''le~leu!''\n|-\n|      || <small>NEG</small> || <small>RDP</small>~fight\n|-\n|      ||colspan=\"2\"| 'Don't fight!'{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=164}}\n|}\n\n====Non-volitive ''kou''====\nThe third and last negative modal is ''kou'' 'unwilling', which is used to indicate non-volition. It appears in the same place as ''teigha'' and ''tabu'', but carries a more specific meaning.\n\nIn example (28), if the more general ''teigha'' '<small>NEG</small>' had been used instead of ''kou'', it would simply mean that the fish do not eat the bait. However, in (28), the fish not only ''do'' not eat the bait, but they ''will'' not.{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=164}}\n\nExample (29) has the words ''laka'' 'also' and ''t-i'' '<small>RL</small>-<small>LOC</small>' in between the negator and the article ''na''.\n\n:{|\n| (28) || '''''Kou''''' || ''na'' || ''vanga'' || ''na'' || ''igha.''\n|-\n|      || <small>NEG</small> || <small>ART</small> || eat || <small>ART</small> || fish\n|-\n|      || colspan=\"5\"| 'The fish are unwilling to eat [the bait].'{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=164}}\n|}\n:{|\n| (29) || ''Ma'' || ''na'' || ''tha'' || ''laka'' || ''e'' || '''''kou''''' || ''laka'' || ''t-i'' || ''na'' || ''lighu-ni-a'' || ''ghini-a'' || ''igha'' || ''deni'' || ''m-e'' || ''ghe'' || ''laka'' || ''po'' || ''t-i'' || ''tena'' || ''maone.''\n|-\n|      || <small>CONJ</small> || <small>ART</small> || <small>REL</small> || also || 3<small>SG</small> || <small>NEG</small> || also || <small>RL</small>-<small>LOC</small> || <small>ART</small> || pass-<small>TR</small>-o:3<small>SG</small> || <small>INST</small>-o:3<small>SG</small> || fish || <small>DEM</small> || <small>CONJ</small>-3<small>SG</small> || continue || also || <small>LIM</small> || <small>RL</small>-<small>LOC</small> || <small>LOC</small> || sand\n|-\n|      ||colspan=\"20\"| 'And what's more, he [the fish] was unwilling to be passed by him [the turtle] so this fish also just continued onto the sand.'{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=164}}\n|}\n\n===Auxiliary ''boro''===\nIn Lengo, tense auxiliaries appear before the subject reference pronoun and verb. There are two tense auxiliaries: ''bo'' '<small>FUT</small>' and ''boro'' 'impossible <small>FUT</small>'. While ''boro'' is perhaps not a straightforward example of negation, it nevertheless does carry a meaning of 'negation for a reason'. If ''tabu'' is specifically prohibitive and ''kou'' is specifically non-volitive, then ''boro'' can be presented as a negator denoting impossibility. Furthermore, it is sometimes glossed as <small>NEG</small>, as in (30):\n\n:{|\n| (30) || '''''Boro''''' || ''k-e'' || ''ghe'' || ''dea'' || ''tena'' || ''group'' || ''sakai,'' || '''''boro''''' || ''tena'' || ''group'' || ''ruka,'' || ''ba'' || ''k-e'' || ''masi'' || ''ba'' || ''oli'' || ''ba'' || ''tena'' || ''nimiu'' || ''na'' || ''thara'' || ''tibo-miu'' || ''t-i'' || ''ighamu'' || ''na'' || ''K.''\n|-\n|      || <small>NEG</small> || <small>IRR</small>-3<small>SG</small> || continue || go || <small>LOC</small> || group || one || <small>NEG</small> || <small>LOC</small> || group || two || <small>FUT</small> || <small>IRR</small>-3<small>SG</small> || must || <small>FUT</small> || return || <small>FUT</small> || <small>LOC</small> || <small>PS</small>:2<small>PL</small> || <small>ART</small> || feast.row || <small>REFL</small>-<small>PS</small>:2<small>PL</small> || <small>RL</small>-<small>LOC</small> || <small>EP</small>:2<small>PL</small> || <small>ART</small> || K\n|-\n|      || colspan=\"26\"|'It cannot go to group one, it cannot go to group two; it must return to your feast row\u2014yourselves [group] K.'{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=135}}\n|}\n\nExample (31) shows ''boro'' glossed as 'impossible'. However, it still has the effect of negating the verb.\n\n:{|\n| (31) || ''pukua'' || ''na'' || ''thara'' || ''deni'' || '''''boro''''' || ''k-a'' || ''tovothi'' || ''thudu''\n|-\n|      || because || <small>ART</small> || feast || <small>DEM</small> || impossible || <small>IRR</small>-1<small>IN.PL</small> || separate || sit\n|-\n|      ||colspan=\"8\"| 'because at this feast it will be impossible for us to sit separate'{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=111}}\n|}\n\n===Double negative construction===\nThe modal ''teigha'' '<small>NEG</small> can be combined with the ''mo ... mo'' '<small>NEG ... NEG</small>' structure to create a double negative, which carries the meaning of a strong affirmative, as in (32). However, this construction (meaning 'must') is rarely used. Instead, the Pijin form ''masi'' 'must', a borrowing from English, is much more common.{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=138}}\n\nExample (33) shows the same sentence as (32), but without either of the negation structures. This example is a simple imperative.\n\n:{|\n| (32) || ''k-o'' || '''''mo''''' || ''ghe'' || '''''teigha''''' || '''''mo''''' || ''na'' || ''mai''\n|-\n|      || <small>IRR</small>-2<small>SG</small> || <small>NEG</small> || continue || <small>NEG</small> || <small>NEG</small> || <small>ART</small> || come\n|-\n|      || colspan=\"9\" | 'you must come' (lit., 'you must not not continue to come'){{sfn|Unger|2008|p=138}}\n|}\n:{|\n| (33) || ''k-o'' || ''ghe'' || ''mai''\n|-\n|      || <small>IRR</small>-2<small>SG</small> || continue || come\n|-\n|      ||colspan=\"3\"| 'you, continue coming'{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=139}}\n|}\n\n==Abbreviations==\nThe following is a list of all the abbreviations used in this article.\n{|\n| 1\n| first person\n|-\n| 2\n| second person\n|-\n| 3\n| third person\n|-\n| <small>APPR</small>\n| apprehensive\n|-\n| <small>ART</small>\n| article\n|-\n| <small>CLF</small>\n| classifier\n|-\n| <small>CONJ</small>\n| conjunction\n|-\n| <small>DEM</small>\n| demonstrative\n|-\n| <small>DU</small>\n| dual\n|-\n| <small>EP</small>\n| emphatic pronoun\n|-\n| <small>EX</small>\n| exclusive\n|-\n| <small>FUT</small>\n| future\n|-\n| <small>IMPF</small>\n| imperfective\n|-\n| <small>INST</small>\n| instrumental\n|-\n| <small>INT</small>\n| interrogative\n|-\n| <small>IRR</small>\n| irrealis\n|-\n| <small>LIM</small>\n| limiter\n|-\n| <small>LOC</small>\n| locative\n|-\n| o/O\n| object\n|-\n| <small>PFCT</small>\n| perfective\n|-\n| <small>PL</small>\n| plural\n|-\n| <small>PS</small>\n| possessor pronoun / person\n|-\n| <small>RDP</small>\n| reduplication\n|-\n| <small>RL</small>\n| realis\n|-\n| <small>REFL</small>\n| reflexive\n|-\n| <small>REL</small>\n| relative pronoun\n|-\n| <small>SG</small>\n| singular\n|-\n| <small>TR</small>\n| transitivitiser\n|}\n\n==Citations==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n{{cite thesis |last= Unger|first= Paul|date= 2008|title= Aspects of Lengo grammar|publisher= Trinity Western University|ref=harv}}\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n* Materials on Karnai are included in the open access [[Arthur Capell]] collections ([http://catalog.paradisec.org.au/collections/AC1 AC1] and [http://catalog.paradisec.org.au/collections/AC2 AC2]) held by [[Paradisec]]\n\n{{Languages of the Solomon Islands}}\n[[Category:Gela-Guadalcanal languages]]\n[[Category:Languages of the Solomon Islands]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Austronesian language sopken in the Solomon Islands}}\n{{Infobox language\n|name=Lengo\n|states=[[Solomon Islands]]\n|region=[[Guadalcanal]]\n|speakers=14,000\n|date=1999\n|ref=e18\n|familycolor=Austronesian\n|fam2=[[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]] \n|fam3=[[Oceanic languages|Oceanic]]\n|fam4=[[Southeast Solomonic languages|Southeast Solomonic]]\n|fam5=[[Gela\u2013Guadalcanal languages|Gela\u2013Guadalcanal]]\n|fam6=[[Gela languages|Gelic]]\n|iso3=lgr\n|glotto=leng1259\n|glottorefname=Lengo\n}}\n\n'''Lengo''' is a [[Southeast Solomonic languages|Southeast Solomonic]] language of [[Guadalcanal]].\n\n==Phonology==\n\n===Vowels===\n\nLengo has 6 [[vowel]]s.{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=5}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!\n!

These are emphatic, subject reference, object, direct possessor, and indirect possessor. These distinguish maximally between four [[Grammatical person|persons]] (first person inclusive and exclusive, second, and third person), and four [[Grammatical number|numbers]] (singular, plural, dual, and paucal). There is no [[grammatical gender]] distinction, but there is an [[animacy]] distinction in the object paradigm. Two further uses of these pronominal forms occur - a [[reflexive pronoun]], and a set of [[Interrogative word|interrogative pronouns]].{{sfn|Unger|2008|pp=27-29}}\n\nThe dual and paucal forms are derived from the plural forms by the addition of '''ko-''' and '''tu-''' respectively.\nThe dual forms are used only to indicate ''''two and only two'''', whilst the plural and paucal forms mean ''''two or more'''' and ''''three or more'''' respectively. First person exclusive excludes the addresse(s).\n\n====Emphatic pronouns====\nThe emphatic pronoun in Lengo is optional, and can occur in combination with obligatory pronouns that may occur with subject or object function. It can also appear without other pronouns. It is used to emphasize the semantic role of a noun in a clause.{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=29}}\n \n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n! {{sfn|Unger|2008|p=29}}\n!

There are three modals which can appear in the serial verb construction and are negative (''teigha''), prohibitive (''tabu'') or non-volitive (''kou''). Lastly, there is the auxiliary ''boro'' 'impossible <small>FUT</small>', which is sometimes glossed as '<small>NEG</small>' and can negate the verb.\n\nThe ''mo ... mo'' '<small>NEG ... NEG</small>' structure can also be combined with ''teigha'' '<small>NEG</small>' to create a double negative, which carries the meaning of a strong affirmative.{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=137}}\n\n===Discontinuous morpheme ''mo ... mo''===\nThe grammatical negator, the ''mo ... mo'' '<small>NEG ... NEG</small>' structure, is the only instance of a 'discontinuous' morpheme in Lengo. The morpheme ''mo'' appears both before and after the verb being negated.{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=137}} The basic structure of this construction is ''mo V mo'', as seen in (13) and (14):\n\n:{|\n| (13) || '''''Mo''''' || ''ole'' || '''''mo'''''.\n|-\n|      ||<small>NEG</small>|| walk ||<small>NEG</small>\n|-\n|      ||colspan=\"3\"|'Don't walk.'{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=138}}\n|}\n:{|\n| (14) || '''''Mo''''' || ''thaghata'' || ''leo'' || '''''mo'''''. \n|-\n|      ||<small>NEG</small>|| bad || inside ||<small>NEG</small>\n|-\n|      ||colspan=\"4\"|'Don't worry.'{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=138}}\n|}\n\nA variant of this construction is ''mo ... mo'''a''''', as seen in (15).\n\n:{|\n| (15) || ''ko'' || '''''mo''''' || ''lubathia'' || '''''moa''''' || ''pe'' || ''dea'' \n|-\n|      ||2<small>SG</small>||<small>NEG</small>||let.3<small>SG</small>||<small>NEG</small>||or.3<small>SG</small>|| go \n|-\n|      ||colspan=\"6\"|'Don't let it out (release it) or it will run away.'{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=201}}\n|}\n\nNote that although all examples presented by Unger show ''mo ... mo'' '<small>NEG ... NEG</small>' used for a negative imperative, it should not be assumed that this construction is exclusive to a particular sentence structure. More examples are needed for a satisfactory conclusion.\n\nRegardless, ''mo ... mo'' is an uncommon negator in Lengo. Much more frequently used is the modal ''teigha'' '<small>NEG</small>'.\n\n===Modals===\nLengo has a 'serial verb construction'. The various types of serial verb construction identified are directional, sequential, causative, manner, ambient, comitative, dative, instrumental and modal.{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=141}} The basic structure of a modal serial verb construction is as follows:\n\n:V + ''na'' V(-O){{sfn|Unger|2008|p=141}}\n\nThe first verb is the modal verb, and the second verb follows an article (always ''na''). This second verb is treated somewhat like an infinitive.{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=159}} Lengo has five modal verbs; of these, three are used to create negative constructions. These three are:{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=158}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n! Modal\n! Meaning\n|-\n| ''teigha''\n| negative\n|-\n| ''tabu''\n| prohibitive\n|-\n| ''kou''\n| non-volitive\n|}\n\n====Negative ''teigha''====\nOf all the ways to express negation in Lengo, the modal ''teigha'' '<small>NEG</small>' is the most versatile and often used.{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=161}} It can be used to negate verbs in statements, like in (16):\n\n:{|\n| (16) || ''ami-ko'' || '''''teigha''''' || ''na'' || ''ta~tavu'' || ''thai-a'' || ''na'' || ''kei'' \n|-\n|      || 1<small>EX.PL-DU</small>||<small>NEG</small>||<small>ART</small>||<small>RDP</small>~find ||'arrive.at'-o:3<small>SG</small>||<small>ART</small>||basket\n|-\n|      ||colspan=\"7\"|'we couldn't find the basket'{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=161}}\n|}\n\nIn (17) and (18), ''teigha'' appears at the very beginning of the serial verb construction, and the realis locative ''t-i'' appears between the negator and the article ''na''. The entire serial verb construction is negated by ''teigha''.\n\n:{|\n| (17) || ''Ba'' || ''k-u'' || '''''teigha''''' || ''t-i'' || ''na'' || ''mono'' || ''varongo'' || ''i'' || ''vanua.''\n|-\n|      || <small>FUT</small> || <small>IRR</small>-1<small>SG</small> || <small>NEG</small> || <small>RL</small>-<small>LOC</small> || <small>ART</small> || stay || quiet || <small>LOC</small> || village\n|-\n|      ||colspan=\"9\"|'I really won't be sitting around in the village.'{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=151}}\n|}\n:{|\n| (18) || ''E'' || '''''teigha''''' || ''t-i'' || ''na'' || ''mono'' || ''varongo!''\n|-\n|      || 3<small>SG</small> || <small>NEG</small> || <small>RL</small>-<small>LOC</small> || <small>ART</small> || stay || quiet\n|-\n|      ||colspan=\"6\"|'He simply cannot be still!'{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=161}}\n|}\n\nSometimes the construction ''teigha na'' undergoes elision and is shortened to ''tena'', like in (19):\n\n:{|\n| (19) || ''\"gami || '''''tena''''' || || ''agri'' || ''ighami,\"'' || ''gi'' || ''gea'' || ''ena'' \n|-\n|      || g-ami || teigha || na || agri || ighami || g-i || gea || ena \n|-\n|      ||<small>PFCT</small>-1<small>EX.PL</small>||<small>NEG</small>||<small>ART</small>|| agree ||<small>EP</small>:1<small>EX.PL</small>||<small>PFCT-LOC</small>||<small>EP</small>:3<small>SG||3<small>SG</small>:stay\n|-\n|      || colspan=\"8\"|'\"we don't agree,\" they said'{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=161}}\n|}\n\nIt is important to note that this shortened form ''tena'' '<small>NEG</small>' should not be confused with ''tena'' '<small>LOC</small>'. Refer to example (20), which shows both homophones in use: the first being the locative and the second (bolded) being the combined modal and article.\n\n:{|\n| (20) || ''tangomana'' || ''tugua'' || ''tena'' || ''bona'' || ''deni.'' || ''E.'' ||colspan=\"2\"| '''''tena''''' || ''tuaghai.'' || ''Geia'' || ''po.'' || ''Taigu.''\n|-\n|      || tangomana || tugu-a || tena || bona || deni || e || teigha || na || tuaghai || geia || po || taigu\n|-\n|      || possible || story-o:3<small>SG</small> || <small>LOC</small> || time || <small>DEM</small> || 3<small>SG</small> || <small>NEG</small> || <small>ART</small> || long || <small>EP</small>:3<small>SG</small> || <small>LIM</small> || thank.you\n|-\n|      ||colspan=\"12\"|'That just the story I am able to tell at this time. It's not long. That's it. Thank you.'{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=230}}\n|}\n\n''Teigha'' is flexible and can be used to create negative polar questions and answer polar questions, as in examples (21), (22) and (23).\n\nExample (21) is a negative polar question which can be answered with either ''eo'' 'yes' or ''teigha'' 'no'. Answering with ''eo'' would mean 'yes, I have '''not''' seen your basket', whereas answering with ''teigha'' would mean 'no, I have seen it'.{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=189}}\n\nIn example (22), ''teigha'' is used to answer a polar question in the negative. In (23), ''teigha'' is modified by an adverbial, ''vata'' 'continue'.\n\n:{|\n| (21) || ''o'' || '''''teigha''''' || ''na'' || ''bere'' || ''na'' || ''kei-gu?''\n|-\n|      || 2<small>SG</small> || <small>NEG</small> || <small>ART</small> || see || <small>ART</small> || basket-<small>PS</small>:1<small>SG</small>\n|-\n|      || colspan=\"6\"|'you haven't seen my basket?'{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=189}}\n|}\n:{|\n| (22) || ''O'' || ''bo'' || ''dea'' || ''i'' || ''leghai?'' || '''''Teigha.'''''\n|-\n|      || 2<small>SG</small> || <small>IMPF</small> || go || <small>LOC</small> || garden || <small>NEG</small>\n|-\n|      || colspan=\"5\"|'Are you going to the garden?'|| 'No.'{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=162}}\n|}\n:{|\n| (23) || ''A'' || ''P.'' || ''t-e'' || ''mai?'' || '''''Teigha''''' || ''vata.''\n|-\n|      || <small>ART</small> || P || <small>RL</small>-3<small>SG</small> || come || <small>NEG</small> || continue\n|-\n|      || colspan=\"4\"|'Has P. come?' ||colspan=\"2\"|'Not yet.'{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=163}}\n|}\n\nIn (24), ''o teigha'' 'or <small>NEG</small>' is added to the end of the sentence to create an alternative question.\n\n:{|\n| (24) || ''Ba'' || ''k-o'' || ''dea'' || ''o'' || '''''teigha'''?'' \n|-\n|      || <small>FUT</small> || <small>IRR</small>-2<small>SG</small> || go || or || <small>NEG</small> \n|-\n|      || colspan=\"5\" |'Are you going or not?'{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=162}}\n|}\n\nA content question can also be answered with ''teigha'', as in (25).\n\n:{|\n| (25) || ''E'' || ''ngitha'' || ''na'' || ''igha'' || ''t-o'' || ''lavi?'' || '''''Teigha.'''''\n|-\n|      || 3<small>SG</small> || how.many || <small>ART</small> || fish || <small>RL</small>-2<small>SG</small> || take || <small>NEG</small>\n|-\n|      || colspan=\"6\"|'How many fish did you catch?' || 'None.'{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=162}}\n|}\n\n====Prohibitive ''tabu''====\nThe word ''tabu'' 'prohibitive (with consequences); forbidden' is another common way of forming a negative. It is often used by parents who are correcting their children.{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=163}} As with ''teigha'' 'no/none', a clause could consist of the single word ''Tabu!'' 'Don't!'{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=76}} The basic structure is the same as with other modals: the first verb is the modal, and it is followed by the article ''na'' and the second verb.\n\nIn (26), the consequence of disobeying is explicitly addressed. In (27), the article ''na'' is omitted, and the consequence of 'or else ...' is implied.\n\n:{|\n| (26) || '''''Tabu''''' || ''na'' || ''lavi-a'' || ''na'' || ''ghau:'' || ''b-e'' || ''ghado-gho''\n|-\n|      || <small>NEG</small> || <small>ART</small> || grab-o:3<small>SG</small> || <small>ART</small> || knife || <small>APPR</small>-3<small>SG</small> || pierce-o:2<small>SG</small>\n|-\n|      || colspan=\"7\"|'Don't grab the knife: no good it cuts you!'{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=163}}\n|}\n:{|\n| (27) || '''''Tabu''''' || ''le~leu!''\n|-\n|      || <small>NEG</small> || <small>RDP</small>~fight\n|-\n|      ||colspan=\"2\"| 'Don't fight!'{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=164}}\n|}\n\n====Non-volitive ''kou''====\nThe third and last negative modal is ''kou'' 'unwilling', which is used to indicate non-volition. It appears in the same place as ''teigha'' and ''tabu'', but carries a more specific meaning.\n\nIn example (28), if the more general ''teigha'' '<small>NEG</small>' had been used instead of ''kou'', it would simply mean that the fish do not eat the bait. However, in (28), the fish not only ''do'' not eat the bait, but they ''will'' not.{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=164}}\n\nExample (29) has the words ''laka'' 'also' and ''t-i'' '<small>RL</small>-<small>LOC</small>' in between the negator and the article ''na''.\n\n:{|\n| (28) || '''''Kou''''' || ''na'' || ''vanga'' || ''na'' || ''igha.''\n|-\n|      || <small>NEG</small> || <small>ART</small> || eat || <small>ART</small> || fish\n|-\n|      || colspan=\"5\"| 'The fish are unwilling to eat [the bait].'{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=164}}\n|}\n:{|\n| (29) || ''Ma'' || ''na'' || ''tha'' || ''laka'' || ''e'' || '''''kou''''' || ''laka'' || ''t-i'' || ''na'' || ''lighu-ni-a'' || ''ghini-a'' || ''igha'' || ''deni'' || ''m-e'' || ''ghe'' || ''laka'' || ''po'' || ''t-i'' || ''tena'' || ''maone.''\n|-\n|      || <small>CONJ</small> || <small>ART</small> || <small>REL</small> || also || 3<small>SG</small> || <small>NEG</small> || also || <small>RL</small>-<small>LOC</small> || <small>ART</small> || pass-<small>TR</small>-o:3<small>SG</small> || <small>INST</small>-o:3<small>SG</small> || fish || <small>DEM</small> || <small>CONJ</small>-3<small>SG</small> || continue || also || <small>LIM</small> || <small>RL</small>-<small>LOC</small> || <small>LOC</small> || sand\n|-\n|      ||colspan=\"20\"| 'And what's more, he [the fish] was unwilling to be passed by him [the turtle] so this fish also just continued onto the sand.'{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=164}}\n|}\n\n===Auxiliary ''boro''===\nIn Lengo, tense auxiliaries appear before the subject reference pronoun and verb. There are two tense auxiliaries: ''bo'' '<small>FUT</small>' and ''boro'' 'impossible <small>FUT</small>'. While ''boro'' is perhaps not a straightforward example of negation, it nevertheless does carry a meaning of 'negation for a reason'. If ''tabu'' is specifically prohibitive and ''kou'' is specifically non-volitive, then ''boro'' can be presented as a negator denoting impossibility. Furthermore, it is sometimes glossed as <small>NEG</small>, as in (30):\n\n:{|\n| (30) || '''''Boro''''' || ''k-e'' || ''ghe'' || ''dea'' || ''tena'' || ''group'' || ''sakai,'' || '''''boro''''' || ''tena'' || ''group'' || ''ruka,'' || ''ba'' || ''k-e'' || ''masi'' || ''ba'' || ''oli'' || ''ba'' || ''tena'' || ''nimiu'' || ''na'' || ''thara'' || ''tibo-miu'' || ''t-i'' || ''ighamu'' || ''na'' || ''K.''\n|-\n|      || <small>NEG</small> || <small>IRR</small>-3<small>SG</small> || continue || go || <small>LOC</small> || group || one || <small>NEG</small> || <small>LOC</small> || group || two || <small>FUT</small> || <small>IRR</small>-3<small>SG</small> || must || <small>FUT</small> || return || <small>FUT</small> || <small>LOC</small> || <small>PS</small>:2<small>PL</small> || <small>ART</small> || feast.row || <small>REFL</small>-<small>PS</small>:2<small>PL</small> || <small>RL</small>-<small>LOC</small> || <small>EP</small>:2<small>PL</small> || <small>ART</small> || K\n|-\n|      || colspan=\"26\"|'It cannot go to group one, it cannot go to group two; it must return to your feast row\u2014yourselves [group] K.'{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=135}}\n|}\n\nExample (31) shows ''boro'' glossed as 'impossible'. However, it still has the effect of negating the verb.\n\n:{|\n| (31) || ''pukua'' || ''na'' || ''thara'' || ''deni'' || '''''boro''''' || ''k-a'' || ''tovothi'' || ''thudu''\n|-\n|      || because || <small>ART</small> || feast || <small>DEM</small> || impossible || <small>IRR</small>-1<small>IN.PL</small> || separate || sit\n|-\n|      ||colspan=\"8\"| 'because at this feast it will be impossible for us to sit separate'{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=111}}\n|}\n\n===Double negative construction===\nThe modal ''teigha'' '<small>NEG</small> can be combined with the ''mo ... mo'' '<small>NEG ... NEG</small>' structure to create a double negative, which carries the meaning of a strong affirmative, as in (32). However, this construction (meaning 'must') is rarely used. Instead, the Pijin form ''masi'' 'must', a borrowing from English, is much more common.{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=138}}\n\nExample (33) shows the same sentence as (32), but without either of the negation structures. This example is a simple imperative.\n\n:{|\n| (32) || ''k-o'' || '''''mo''''' || ''ghe'' || '''''teigha''''' || '''''mo''''' || ''na'' || ''mai''\n|-\n|      || <small>IRR</small>-2<small>SG</small> || <small>NEG</small> || continue || <small>NEG</small> || <small>NEG</small> || <small>ART</small> || come\n|-\n|      || colspan=\"9\" | 'you must come' (lit., 'you must not not continue to come'){{sfn|Unger|2008|p=138}}\n|}\n:{|\n| (33) || ''k-o'' || ''ghe'' || ''mai''\n|-\n|      || <small>IRR</small>-2<small>SG</small> || continue || come\n|-\n|      ||colspan=\"3\"| 'you, continue coming'{{sfn|Unger|2008|p=139}}\n|}\n\n==Abbreviations==\nThe following is a list of all the abbreviations used in this article.\n{|\n| 1\n| first person\n|-\n| 2\n| second person\n|-\n| 3\n| third person\n|-\n| <small>APPR</small>\n| apprehensive\n|-\n| <small>ART</small>\n| article\n|-\n| <small>CLF</small>\n| classifier\n|-\n| <small>CONJ</small>\n| conjunction\n|-\n| <small>DEM</small>\n| demonstrative\n|-\n| <small>DU</small>\n| dual\n|-\n| <small>EP</small>\n| emphatic pronoun\n|-\n| <small>EX</small>\n| exclusive\n|-\n| <small>FUT</small>\n| future\n|-\n| <small>IMPF</small>\n| imperfective\n|-\n| <small>INST</small>\n| instrumental\n|-\n| <small>INT</small>\n| interrogative\n|-\n| <small>IRR</small>\n| irrealis\n|-\n| <small>LIM</small>\n| limiter\n|-\n| <small>LOC</small>\n| locative\n|-\n| o/O\n| object\n|-\n| <small>PFCT</small>\n| perfective\n|-\n| <small>PL</small>\n| plural\n|-\n| <small>PS</small>\n| possessor pronoun / person\n|-\n| <small>RDP</small>\n| reduplication\n|-\n| <small>RL</small>\n| realis\n|-\n| <small>REFL</small>\n| reflexive\n|-\n| <small>REL</small>\n| relative pronoun\n|-\n| <small>SG</small>\n| singular\n|-\n| <small>TR</small>\n| transitivitiser\n|}\n\n==Citations==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n{{cite thesis |last= Unger|first= Paul|date= 2008|title= Aspects of Lengo grammar|publisher= Trinity Western University|ref=harv}}\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n* Materials on Karnai are included in the open access [[Arthur Capell]] collections ([http://catalog.paradisec.org.au/collections/AC1 AC1] and [http://catalog.paradisec.org.au/collections/AC2 AC2]) held by [[Paradisec]]\n\n{{Languages of the Solomon Islands}}\n[[Category:Gela-Guadalcanal languages]]\n[[Category:Languages of the Solomon Islands]]\n", "name_user": "Austronesier", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lengo_language"}

In 2012, the album was ranked number 452 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.<ref name=\"500-greatest\">{{cite magazine| url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-156826/john-prine-john-prine-38560/| year=2012| title=500 Greatest Albums of All Time Rolling Stone\u2019s definitive list of the 500 greatest albums of all time| magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]| accessdate= September 2, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Recording==\nPrine was offered a recording contract by [[Jerry Wexler]] of Atlantic Records after the record executive saw the singer perform several of his own songs at a [[Kris Kristofferson]] show at [[the Bitter End]].  The song \"Paradise\" was recorded at A&R Studios in New York (with Prine's brother Dave and good friend [[Steve Goodman]] as sidemen) but the remaining cuts were recorded at [[American Sound Studios]] in Memphis.  Produced by [[Arif Mardin]], who had previously collaborated with the likes of [[Aretha Franklin]] and [[King Curtis]], Prine found his new studio surroundings intimidating.  In the ''Great Days: The John Prine Anthology'' liner notes he admits, \"I was terrified.  I went straight from playing by myself, still learning how to sing, to playing with [[Elvis Presley]]'s rhythm section.\"  Initially, the musicians at American, accustomed to playing heavily rhythmic material and funky grooves, were thrown by Prine and his songs.  As recounted in Eddie Huffman's biography ''John Prine: In Spite of Himself'', percussionist Hayward Bishop later recalled, \u201cThere was no evidence of groove whatever, and I was hungry for groove.  Prine came off like a folk poet.  This guy was really nasally, he didn\u2019t have any tone to his voice, and all his songs were in the same key! I thought, \u2018This is gonna be like milking a dag-blasted dog!\u2019\u201d{{sfn|Huffman|2015|p=55}}\n\n==Composition==\n''John Prine'' features some of Prine's most heralded compositions, including \"Sam Stone\", \"Paradise\"  and \"Hello In There\".\n\n\"Sam Stone\", a song about a drug-addicted veteran with a [[Purple Heart]] and his death by overdose, was originally titled \"Great Society Conflict Veteran's Blues\".  The most familiar refrain in the song is \"There's a hole in daddy's arm, where all the money goes.\"  The song is usually interpreted as a reference to the phenomenon of [[heroin]] or [[morphine]] addiction among [[Vietnam War]] veterans (an identical surge of addiction followed the Civil War, where morphine addiction was known as 'Soldiers Disease'). The song does not mention the Vietnam War, saying only that Sam returned from \"serving in the conflict overseas.\"  There is a single explicit reference to morphine but Prine alludes to heroin on several occasions including the use of the term \"habit,\" slang commonly associated with heroin use, and the line \"he popped his last balloon,\" very likely referring to one of the ways in which street heroin is commonly packaged - in small rubber balloons.\n\nPrine wrote \"Paradise\" for his father, recalling the devastating impact of strip mining for coal, whereby the top of the mountain is blasted off with dynamite to reach the coal seam below.  The song is also about what happened to the area around the [[Green River (Kentucky)|Green River]] in [[Kentucky]] because of the strip mining.  \"Paradise\" references the Peabody Coal Company and is named for a now-defunct town called Paradise in [[Muhlenberg County, Kentucky]].  The song has become a bluegrass standard, with Prine telling Jasper Rees of theArtsdesk.com that \"When bluegrass musicians gather together, whenever they're together for more than an hour, I'd say that 'Paradise' is one of those songs that one of them starts to play it and they all know it.  Which is pretty neat cos it's a real close personal song.  It was written for my father about where all my family's from, that doesn't exist any more, and to think a song like that - I wasn't even going to record it because I didn't think anybody would be able to pronounce Muhlenberg.\"\n\nIn the ''Great Days'' anthology liner notes Prine claims that he composed \"Hello In There\" as a tribute to senior citizens, saying he \"always had an affinity for old people. I used to help a buddy with his newspaper route, and I delivered to a Baptist old peoples home where we\u2019d have to go room-to-room. And some of the patients would kind of pretend that you were a grandchild or nephew that had come to visit, instead of the guy delivering papers. That always stuck in my head.  It was all that stuff together, along with that pretty melody. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve done a show without singing 'Hello in There'. Nothing in it wears on me.\" In the same essay, Prine explains that the album opener \"Illegal Smile\" was \"not about smokin\u2019 dope. It was more about how, ever since I was a child, I had this view of the world where I can find myself smiling at stuff nobody else was smiling at. But it was such a good anthem for dope smokers that I didn't want to stop every time I played it and make a disclaimer.\"  According to Prine biographer Eddie Huffman, \u201cSpanish Pipedream\u201d is \u201ca hilarious [[Age of Aquarius]] anthem, the hippie commune ideal summed up in less than four minutes.\u201d{{sfn|Huffman|2015|p=49}}\n\nPrine told Paul Zollo of ''BlueRailroad'' that he wrote \"Angel from Montgomery\" after a friend suggested writing \"another song about old people\", referring to Prine's song \"Hello In There.\" Although Prine had \"said everything I wanted to [about seniors] in 'Hello In There'\" he was intrigued by the idea of \"a song about a middle-aged woman who feels older than she is...I had this really vivid picture of this woman standing over the dishwater with soap in her hands...She wanted to get out of her house and her marriage and everything. She just wanted an angel to come to take her away from all this.\"  Prine believes he was likely drawn to [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]] as the song's setting by virtue of being a fan of [[Hank Williams]], who had ties to that city.\n\nFor the sleeve to his 1988 release ''John Prine Live'', the singer wrote that the tragic \"Six O'Clock News\" was about a neighborhood kid \"who was always in trouble and chose me as a friend. His brothers pushed him around a lot, and his mother generally ignored him.  Years later as a teenager, still in trouble, he ended up in Juvenile Court and the prosecutor decided to tell my friend that his father was his father, but his mother was his oldest sister. No wonder he was always in trouble.\"  \u201cDonald and Lydia\u201d was originally called \u201cNatural\u201d about two young lovers failing to connect with anybody but themselves and got the characters\u2019 names from a book to help expectant parents name their baby.{{sfn|Huffman|2015|p=50}}  Prine biographer Eddie Huffman notes, \u201cOn the surface the song may have been about masturbation, but on another level Prine aimed at a deeper truth about loneliness and isolation.{{sfn|Huffman|2015|p=51}}  Steve Goodman would cover the song on his self-titled 1971 album.\n\n\"Your Flag Decal Won't Get You into Heaven Anymore\" is an anti-war song which attacks phony [[patriotism]], especially in the context of exhibitionistic [[chauvinism]]. The song was inspired by an edition of ''Reader\u2019s Digest'' featuring a free flag decal, \u201csuitable for sticking on car windows, storm doors, or anywhere else Middle America felt inspired to show its fealty to the U.S. government.\u201d{{sfn|Huffman|2015|p=41}}\n\nPrine has said in several interviews that \"Far From Me\" is his favorite song that he has written, with the John Prine Shrine website quoting the singer explaining that the line ''a broken bottle looks just like a diamond ring'' \"is in reference to my childhood. We were raised close to a junkyard and one of my favorite pastimes was playing in the junkyard breaking bottles. The kids always commented that the fragments of glass looked just like a field of diamonds. The majority of my songs are written from life experiences and a lot of times there is not any symbolism but just words that take me to another place and time.\"\n\n==Album cover==\n\nThe album cover of ''John Prine'' features the singer sitting on a bale of straw. \"I thought they coulda had me on a bus or something\", the [[Chicago]] native remembered to Lloyd Sachs in 2005.

But I loved the sound of the record, and I can see how for a lot of people it's their favourite record of mine.\"\n\nMany of the songs on John Prine have been recorded by other artists. \"Paradise\" is one of the singer's most covered tunes, having been recorded by [[Johnny Cash]], [[John Fogerty]], [[the Everly Brothers]] and [[Lynn Anderson]], among many others. \"Angel from Montgomery\" was recorded in 1972 by [[Carly Simon]] in her first session for the ''No Secrets'' album and has also been recorded by [[Bonnie Raitt]], who told ''Performing Songwriter'' magazine in 2000, \"I think 'Angel from Montgomery' probably meant more to my fans and my body of work than any other song.\" \"Hello In There\" has appeared on albums by [[Joan Baez]], [[Bette Midler]], and [[David Allan Coe]].

In 2012, the album was ranked number 452 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.<ref name=\"500-greatest\">{{cite magazine| url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-156826/john-prine-john-prine-38560/| year=2012| title=500 Greatest Albums of All Time Rolling Stone\u2019s definitive list of the 500 greatest albums of all time| magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]| accessdate= September 2, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Recording==\nPrine was offered a recording contract by [[Jerry Wexler]] of Atlantic Records after the record executive saw the singer perform several of his own songs at a [[Kris Kristofferson]] show at [[the Bitter End]].  The song \"Paradise\" was recorded at A&R Studios in New York (with Prine's brother Dave and good friend [[Steve Goodman]] as sidemen) but the remaining cuts were recorded at [[American Sound Studios]] in Memphis.  Produced by [[Arif Mardin]], who had previously collaborated with the likes of [[Aretha Franklin]] and [[King Curtis]], Prine found his new studio surroundings intimidating.  In the ''Great Days: The John Prine Anthology'' liner notes he admits, \"I was terrified.  I went straight from playing by myself, still learning how to sing, to playing with [[Elvis Presley]]'s rhythm section.\"  Initially, the musicians at American, accustomed to playing heavily rhythmic material and funky grooves, were thrown by Prine and his songs.  As recounted in Eddie Huffman's biography ''John Prine: In Spite of Himself'', percussionist Hayward Bishop later recalled, \u201cThere was no evidence of groove whatever, and I was hungry for groove.  Prine came off like a folk poet.  This guy was really nasally, he didn\u2019t have any tone to his voice, and all his songs were in the same key! I thought, \u2018This is gonna be like milking a dag-blasted dog!\u2019\u201d{{sfn|Huffman|2015|p=55}}\n\n==Composition==\n''John Prine'' features some of Prine's most heralded compositions, including \"Sam Stone\", \"Paradise\"  and \"Hello In There\".\n\n\"Sam Stone\", a song about a drug-addicted veteran with a [[Purple Heart]] and his death by overdose, was originally titled \"Great Society Conflict Veteran's Blues\".  The most familiar refrain in the song is \"There's a hole in daddy's arm, where all the money goes.\"  The song is usually interpreted as a reference to the phenomenon of [[heroin]] or [[morphine]] addiction among [[Vietnam War]] veterans (an identical surge of addiction followed the Civil War, where morphine addiction was known as 'Soldiers Disease'). The song does not mention the Vietnam War, saying only that Sam returned from \"serving in the conflict overseas.\"  There is a single explicit reference to morphine but Prine alludes to heroin on several occasions including the use of the term \"habit,\" slang commonly associated with heroin use, and the line \"he popped his last balloon,\" very likely referring to one of the ways in which street heroin is commonly packaged - in small rubber balloons.\n\nPrine wrote \"Paradise\" for his father, recalling the devastating impact of strip mining for coal, whereby the top of the mountain is blasted off with dynamite to reach the coal seam below.  The song is also about what happened to the area around the [[Green River (Kentucky)|Green River]] in [[Kentucky]] because of the strip mining.  \"Paradise\" references the Peabody Coal Company and is named for a now-defunct town called Paradise in [[Muhlenberg County, Kentucky]].  The song has become a bluegrass standard, with Prine telling Jasper Rees of theArtsdesk.com that \"When bluegrass musicians gather together, whenever they're together for more than an hour, I'd say that 'Paradise' is one of those songs that one of them starts to play it and they all know it.  Which is pretty neat cos it's a real close personal song.  It was written for my father about where all my family's from, that doesn't exist any more, and to think a song like that - I wasn't even going to record it because I didn't think anybody would be able to pronounce Muhlenberg.\"\n\nIn the ''Great Days'' anthology liner notes Prine claims that he composed \"Hello In There\" as a tribute to senior citizens, saying he \"always had an affinity for old people. I used to help a buddy with his newspaper route, and I delivered to a Baptist old peoples home where we\u2019d have to go room-to-room. And some of the patients would kind of pretend that you were a grandchild or nephew that had come to visit, instead of the guy delivering papers. That always stuck in my head.  It was all that stuff together, along with that pretty melody. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve done a show without singing 'Hello in There'. Nothing in it wears on me.\" In the same essay, Prine explains that the album opener \"Illegal Smile\" was \"not about smokin\u2019 dope. It was more about how, ever since I was a child, I had this view of the world where I can find myself smiling at stuff nobody else was smiling at. But it was such a good anthem for dope smokers that I didn't want to stop every time I played it and make a disclaimer.\"  According to Prine biographer Eddie Huffman, \u201cSpanish Pipedream\u201d is \u201ca hilarious [[Age of Aquarius]] anthem, the hippie commune ideal summed up in less than four minutes.\u201d{{sfn|Huffman|2015|p=49}}\n\nPrine told Paul Zollo of ''BlueRailroad'' that he wrote \"Angel from Montgomery\" after a friend suggested writing \"another song about old people\", referring to Prine's song \"Hello In There.\" Although Prine had \"said everything I wanted to [about seniors] in 'Hello In There'\" he was intrigued by the idea of \"a song about a middle-aged woman who feels older than she is...I had this really vivid picture of this woman standing over the dishwater with soap in her hands...She wanted to get out of her house and her marriage and everything. She just wanted an angel to come to take her away from all this.\"  Prine believes he was likely drawn to [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]] as the song's setting by virtue of being a fan of [[Hank Williams]], who had ties to that city.\n\nFor the sleeve to his 1988 release ''John Prine Live'', the singer wrote that the tragic \"Six O'Clock News\" was about a neighborhood kid \"who was always in trouble and chose me as a friend.

The origin of the name ''Niger'', which originally applied only to the middle reaches of the Niger River, is uncertain. The word is likely an alteration of the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] name ''egerew <u>n-iger</u>ewen''  used by inhabitants along the middle reaches of the river around [[Timbuktu]] prior to 19th-century European colonialism.<ref>The Arabic name ''nahr al-anhur'' is a direct translation of the Tuareg.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Niger |title=''Online Etymological Dictionary'' |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=28 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of Nigeria|Timeline of Nigerian history}}\n[[File:Intricate bronze ceremonial pot, 9th century, Igbo-Ukwu, Nigeria.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Ceremonial Igbo pot from 9th-century [[Igbo-Ukwu]]]] \n\n=== Early (1,500 BC \u2013 1500) ===\n{{Further|History of Nigeria before 1500}}\n[[File:Nok sculpture Louvre 70-1998-11-1.jpg|thumb|[[Nok]] sculpture, [[terracotta]]]]\nThe [[Nok culture|Nok civilisation]] of [[Northern Nigeria]] flourished between 1,500 BC and AD 200.

In the 16th century, [[Portuguese explorers]] were the first Europeans to begin significant, direct trade with peoples of modern-day Nigeria, at the port they named [[Lagos]] and in [[Calabar]].

The Atlantic slave trade was engaged in by European companies until it was outlawed in 1807.  After that illegal smugglers purchased slaves along the coast by native slavers. Britain's [[West Africa Squadron]] sought to intercept the smugglers at sea. The rescued slaves were taken to [[Freetown]], a colony in West Africa originally established for the resettlement of freed slaves from Britain. Britain intervened in the Lagos Kingship power struggle by bombarding Lagos in 1851, deposing the slave trade friendly Oba Kosoko, helping to install the amenable Oba [[Akitoye]], and signing the [[Treaty Between Great Britain and Lagos, 1 January 1852|Treaty between Great Britain and Lagos]] on 1 January 1852. Britain annexed Lagos as a Crown Colony in August 1861 with the [[Lagos Treaty of Cession]]. British missionaries expanded their operations and travelled further inland.

The following year, it chartered the [[Royal Niger Company]] under the leadership of Sir [[George Taubman Goldie]]. In 1900 the company's territory came under the control of the British government, which moved to consolidate its hold over the area of modern Nigeria. On 1 January 1901, Nigeria became a British [[protectorate]], and part of the [[British Empire]], the foremost world power at the time. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the independent kingdoms of what would become Nigeria fought a number of conflicts against the British Empire's efforts to expand its territory. By war, the British conquered [[Benin Empire|Benin]] in 1897, and, in the [[Anglo-Aro War]] (1901\u20131902), defeated other opponents. The restraint or conquest of these states opened up the Niger area to British rule.  In 1914, the British formally united the Niger area as the ''Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria''. Administratively, Nigeria remained divided into the [[Northern Nigeria|Northern]] and [[Southern Nigeria Protectorate|Southern]] Protectorates and [[Lagos Colony]]. Inhabitants of the southern region sustained more interaction, economic and cultural, with the British and other Europeans owing to the coastal economy.<ref>Toyin Falola and Matthew M.

Many of the immigrants, sometimes called [[Saro (Nigeria)|Saro]] (immigrants from Sierra Leone) and Amaro (ex-slaves from Brazil)<ref>Abiola Dosumu Elegbede-Fernandez, ''Lagos A Legacy of Honour.''

The official language of Nigeria, English, was chosen to facilitate the cultural and linguistic unity of the country, owing to the influence of [[Colonial Nigeria|British colonisation]] that ended in 1960.\n\nMany French speakers from surrounding countries have influenced the English spoken in the border regions of Nigeria and some Nigerian citizens have become fluent enough in French to work in the surrounding countries. The French spoken in Nigeria may be mixed with some native languages but is mostly spoken like the French spoken in Benin. French may also be mixed with English as it is in Cameroon.\n\nThe major languages spoken in Nigeria represent three major families of [[languages of Africa]]: the majority are [[Niger\u2013Congo languages|Niger-Congo]] languages, such as [[Igbo language|Igbo]], [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], [[Ijaw language|Ijaw]], [[Fulfulde]], [[Ogoni language|Ogoni]], and [[Edo language|Edo]]. [[Kanuri language|Kanuri]], spoken in the northeast, primarily in [[Borno State|Borno]] and [[Yobe State]], is part of the [[Nilo-Saharan]] family, and [[Hausa language|Hausa]] is an [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] language.\n\nEven though most ethnic groups prefer to communicate in their own languages, English as the official language is widely used for education, business transactions and for official purposes. English as a first language is used only by a small minority of the country's urban elite, and it is not spoken at all in some rural areas. Hausa is the most widely spoken of the three main languages spoken in Nigeria itself.\n\nWith the majority of Nigeria's populace in the rural areas, the major languages of communication in the country remain indigenous languages. Some of the largest of these, notably Yoruba and Igbo, have derived standardised languages from a number of different dialects and are widely spoken by those ethnic groups. [[Nigerian Pidgin English]], often known simply as \"[[Pidgin]]\" or \"Broken\" (Broken English), is also a popular [[lingua franca]], though with varying regional influences on dialect and slang. The pidgin English or Nigerian English is widely spoken within the [[Niger Delta]] Regions, predominantly in [[Warri]], [[Sapele, Delta|Sapele]], [[Port Harcourt]], [[Agenebode]], [[Ewu]], and [[Benin City]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Multilingualism: A Nigerian Case Study |first=Efurosibina E. |last=Adegbija |publisher=Africa World Press |year=2003 |isbn=978-1-59221-173-9 |page=55 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=auI_WuBrWncC&pg=PA55 |location=Last paragraph |accessdate=26 December 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Religion===\n{{Main|Religion in Nigeria}}\n{{Pie chart\n|thumb = right\n|caption = Religion in Nigeria (2013)<ref name=\"Cia 19\">CIA Factbook : Nigeria [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ni.html] (Retrieved 1 May 2019)</ref>\n\n|label1 = [[Islam]]\n|value1 = 51.6\n|color1 = Green\n|label2 = [[Christianity]]\n|value2 = 47\n|color2 = DodgerBlue\n|label3 = [[Traditional African religions]]\n|value3 = 1.4\n|color3 = White\n}}\n\nNigeria is a religiously diverse society, with [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]] being the most widely professed religions.

The Atlantic slave trade was engaged in by European companies until it was outlawed in 1807.  After that illegal smugglers purchased slaves along the coast by native slavers. Britain's [[West Africa Squadron]] sought to intercept the smugglers at sea. The rescued slaves were taken to [[Freetown]], a colony in West Africa originally established for the resettlement of freed slaves from Britain. Britain intervened in the Lagos Kingship power struggle by bombarding Lagos in 1851, deposing the slave trade friendly Oba Kosoko, helping to install the amenable Oba [[Akitoye]], and signing the [[Treaty Between Great Britain and Lagos, 1 January 1852|Treaty between Great Britain and Lagos]] on 1 January 1852. Britain annexed Lagos as a Crown Colony in August 1861 with the [[Lagos Treaty of Cession]]. British missionaries expanded their operations and travelled further inland.

The following year, it chartered the [[Royal Niger Company]] under the leadership of Sir [[George Taubman Goldie]]. In 1900 the company's territory came under the control of the British government, which moved to consolidate its hold over the area of modern Nigeria. On 1 January 1901, Nigeria became a British [[protectorate]], and part of the [[British Empire]], the foremost world power at the time. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the independent kingdoms of what would become Nigeria fought a number of conflicts against the British Empire's efforts to expand its territory. By war, the British conquered [[Benin Empire|Benin]] in 1897, and, in the [[Anglo-Aro War]] (1901\u20131902), defeated other opponents. The restraint or conquest of these states opened up the Niger area to British rule.  In 1914, the British formally united the Niger area as the ''Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria''. Administratively, Nigeria remained divided into the [[Northern Nigeria|Northern]] and [[Southern Nigeria Protectorate|Southern]] Protectorates and [[Lagos Colony]].

With the fall of oil prices during the [[1980s oil glut]] Nigeria struggled to keep up with its loan payments and eventually defaulted on its principal debt repayments, limiting repayment to the interest portion of the loans. Arrears and penalty interest accumulated on the unpaid principal, which increased the size of the debt. After negotiations by the Nigerian authorities, in October 2005 Nigeria and its [[Paris Club]] creditors reached an agreement under which Nigeria repurchased its debt at a discount of approximately 60%. Nigeria used part of its oil profits to pay the residual 40%, freeing up at least $1.15&nbsp;billion annually for poverty reduction programmes.

The spacecraft was operated by [[NigComSat]] and the Nigerian Space Agency, [[NASRDA]]. On 11 November 2008, NigComSat-1 failed in orbit after running out of power because of an anomaly in its solar array.

The official language of Nigeria, English, was chosen to facilitate the cultural and linguistic unity of the country, owing to the influence of [[Colonial Nigeria|British colonisation]] that ended in 1960.\n\nMany French speakers from surrounding countries have influenced the English spoken in the border regions of Nigeria and some Nigerian citizens have become fluent enough in French to work in the surrounding countries. The French spoken in Nigeria may be mixed with some native languages but is mostly spoken like the French spoken in Benin. French may also be mixed with English as it is in Cameroon.\n\nThe major languages spoken in Nigeria represent three major families of [[languages of Africa]]: the majority are [[Niger\u2013Congo languages|Niger-Congo]] languages, such as [[Igbo language|Igbo]], [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], [[Ijaw language|Ijaw]], [[Fulfulde]], [[Ogoni language|Ogoni]], and [[Edo language|Edo]]. [[Kanuri language|Kanuri]], spoken in the northeast, primarily in [[Borno State|Borno]] and [[Yobe State]], is part of the [[Nilo-Saharan]] family, and [[Hausa language|Hausa]] is an [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] language.\n\nEven though most ethnic groups prefer to communicate in their own languages, English as the official language is widely used for education, business transactions and for official purposes. English as a first language is used only by a small minority of the country's urban elite, and it is not spoken at all in some rural areas. Hausa is the most widely spoken of the three main languages spoken in Nigeria itself.\n\nWith the majority of Nigeria's populace in the rural areas, the major languages of communication in the country remain indigenous languages. Some of the largest of these, notably Yoruba and Igbo, have derived standardised languages from a number of different dialects and are widely spoken by those ethnic groups. [[Nigerian Pidgin English]], often known simply as \"[[Pidgin]]\" or \"Broken\" (Broken English), is also a popular [[lingua franca]], though with varying regional influences on dialect and slang. The pidgin English or Nigerian English is widely spoken within the [[Niger Delta]] Regions, predominantly in [[Warri]], [[Sapele, Delta|Sapele]], [[Port Harcourt]], [[Agenebode]], [[Ewu]], and [[Benin City]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Multilingualism: A Nigerian Case Study |first=Efurosibina E. |last=Adegbija |publisher=Africa World Press |year=2003 |isbn=978-1-59221-173-9 |page=55 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=auI_WuBrWncC&pg=PA55 |location=Last paragraph |accessdate=26 December 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Religion===\n{{Main|Religion in Nigeria}}\n{{Pie chart\n|thumb = right\n|caption = Religion in Nigeria (2013)<ref name=\"Cia 19\">CIA Factbook : Nigeria [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ni.html] (Retrieved 1 May 2019)</ref>\n\n|label1 = [[Islam]]\n|value1 = 51.6\n|color1 = Green\n|label2 = [[Christianity]]\n|value2 = 47\n|color2 = DodgerBlue\n|label3 = [[Traditional African religions]]\n|value3 = 1.4\n|color3 = White\n}}\n\nNigeria is a religiously diverse society, with [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]] being the most widely professed religions.
