It is used to express the ratio of one value of a [[Power, root-power, and field quantities|power or field quantity]] to another, on a [[logarithmic scale]], the logarithmic quantity being called the power level or field level, respectively.\n\nIt can be used to express a change in value (e.g., +1&nbsp;dB or &minus;1&nbsp;dB) or an absolute value. In the latter case, it expresses the ratio of a value to a fixed reference value; when used in this way, a suffix that indicates the reference value is often appended to the decibel symbol. For example, if the reference value is 1&nbsp;[[volt]], then the suffix is \"[[#Voltage|V]]\" (e.g., \"20&nbsp;dBV\"), and if the reference value is one [[milliwatt]], then the suffix is \"[[dBm|m]]\" (e.g., \"20&nbsp;dBm\").<ref name=\"clqgmk\"/>\n\nTwo different scales are used when expressing a ratio in decibels, depending on the nature of the quantities: power and field (root-power). When expressing a power ratio, the number of decibels is ten times its [[Common logarithm|logarithm to base 10]].<ref>{{cite book |title=IEEE Standard 100: a dictionary of IEEE standards and terms |edition=7th |publisher=The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineering |location=New York |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-7381-2601-2 |page=288}}</ref> That is, a change in ''power'' by a factor of 10 corresponds to a 10&nbsp;dB change in level. When expressing field (root-power) quantities, a change in ''amplitude'' by a factor of 10 corresponds to a 20&nbsp;dB change in level. The decibel scales differ by a factor of two so that the related power and field levels change by the same number of decibels with linear loads.\n\nThe definition of the decibel is based on the measurement of power in [[telephony]] of the early 20th&nbsp;century in the [[Bell System]] in the United States. One decibel is one tenth ([[deci-]]) of one '''bel''', named in honor of [[Alexander Graham Bell]]; however, the bel is seldom used. Today, the decibel is used for a wide variety of measurements in science and [[engineering]], most prominently in [[acoustics]], [[electronics]], and [[control theory]]. In electronics, the [[Gain (electronics)|gain]]s of amplifiers, [[attenuation]] of signals, and [[signal-to-noise ratio]]s are often expressed in decibels.\n\nIn the [[International System of Quantities]], the decibel is defined as a unit of measurement for quantities of type [[Level (logarithmic quantity)|level]] or level difference, which are defined as the [[logarithm]] of the ratio of power- or field-type quantities.<ref name=\"standardization2006\">{{cite web |title=ISO 80000-3:2006 |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=31888 |publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization]] |access-date=2013-07-20 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|MSC|TU|bel}}History==\nThe decibel originates from methods used to quantify signal loss in telegraph and telephone circuits. The unit for loss was originally ''Miles of Standard Cable'' (MSC). 1&nbsp;MSC corresponded to the loss of power over a 1&nbsp;[[mile]] (approximately 1.6&nbsp;km) length of standard telephone cable at a frequency of 5000&nbsp;[[radian]]s per second (795.8&nbsp;Hz), and matched closely the smallest attenuation detectable to the average listener.

The introduction of cable in 1896 afforded a stable basis for a convenient unit and the \"mile of standard\" cable came into general use shortly thereafter. This unit was employed up to 1923 when a new unit was adopted as being more suitable for modern telephone work. The new transmission unit is widely used among the foreign telephone organizations and recently it was termed the \"decibel\" at the suggestion of the International Advisory Committee on Long Distance Telephony.\n\nThe decibel may be defined by the statement that two amounts of power differ by 1 decibel when they are in the ratio of 10<sup>0.1</sup> and any two amounts of power differ by ''N'' decibels when they are in the ratio of 10<sup>''N''(0.1)</sup>. The number of transmission units expressing the ratio of any two powers is therefore ten times the common logarithm of that ratio. This method of designating the gain or loss of power in telephone circuits permits direct addition or subtraction of the units expressing the efficiency of different parts of the circuit&nbsp;...}}\n\nIn 1954, J. W. Horton argued that the use of the decibel as a unit for quantities other than transmission loss led to confusion, and suggested the name ''logit'' for \"standard magnitudes which combine by multiplication\", to contrast with the name ''unit'' for \"standard magnitudes which combine by addition\".<ref>{{cite journal |first=J.

The bel (B) is {{1/2}}&nbsp;ln(10) [[neper]]s: {{nowrap|1=1 B = {{1/2}} ln(10) Np}}. The neper is the change in the [[level (logarithmic quantity)|level]] of a field quantity when the field quantity changes by a factor of [[e (mathematical constant)|''e'']], that is {{nowrap|1=1 Np = ln(e) = 1}}, thereby relating all of the units as nondimensional natural log of field-quantity ratios, {{nowrap|1=1 dB = 0.11513\u2026 Np = 0.11513\u2026}}.  Finally, the level of a quantity is the logarithm of the ratio of the value of that quantity to a reference value of the same kind of quantity.\n\nTherefore, the bel represents the logarithm of a ratio between two power quantities of 10:1, or the logarithm of a ratio between two field quantities of {{radic|10}}:1.<ref>{{cite book |title=International Standard CEI-IEC 27-3 |chapter=Letter symbols to be used in electrical technology |at=Part 3: Logarithmic quantities and units |publisher=International Electrotechnical Commission}}</ref>\n\nTwo signals whose levels differ by one decibel have a power ratio of 10<sup>1/10</sup>, which is approximately 1.25893, and an amplitude (field quantity) ratio of 10<sup>{{frac|20}}</sup> (1.12202).<ref>{{cite book |author-last=Mark |author-first=James E. |title=Physical Properties of Polymers Handbook |publisher=Springer |date=2007 |page=1025 |quote=[\u2026] the decibel represents a reduction in power of 1.258 times [\u2026]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author-last=Yost |author-first=William |title=Fundamentals of Hearing: An Introduction |url=https://archive.org/details/fundamentalsofhe00yost |url-access=registration |publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston |edition=Second |date=1985 |page=[https://archive.org/details/fundamentalsofhe00yost/page/206 206] |isbn=978-0-12-772690-8 |quote=[\u2026] a pressure ratio of 1.122 equals + 1.0 dB [\u2026]}}</ref>\n\nThe bel is rarely used either without a prefix or with [[metric prefix|SI unit prefixes]] other than ''[[deci-|deci]]''; it is preferred, for example, to use ''hundredths of a decibel'' rather than ''millibels''.

Thus, the ratio of ''P'' (measured power) to ''P''<sub>0</sub> (reference power) is represented by ''L''<sub>''P''</sub>, that ratio expressed in decibels,<ref>{{Cite book |title=Microwave Engineering |author-first=David M. |author-last=Pozar |edition=3rd |publisher=Wiley |date=2005 |isbn=978-0-471-44878-5 |page=63}}</ref> which is calculated using the formula:<ref>IEC 60027-3:2002</ref>\n\n:<math>\nL_P = \\frac{1}{2} \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{P}{P_0}\\right)\\,\\text{Np} = 10 \\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{P}{P_0}\\right)\\,\\text{dB}.\n</math>\n\nThe base-10 logarithm of the ratio of the two power quantities is the number of bels. The number of decibels is ten times the number of bels (equivalently, a decibel is one-tenth of a bel).  ''P'' and ''P''<sub>0</sub> must measure the same type of quantity, and have the same units before calculating the ratio. If {{nowrap|1=''P'' = ''P''<sub>0</sub>}} in the above equation, then ''L''<sub>''P''</sub> = 0. If ''P'' is greater than ''P''<sub>0</sub> then ''L''<sub>''P''</sub> is positive; if ''P'' is less than ''P''<sub>0</sub> then ''L''<sub>''P''</sub> is negative.\n\nRearranging the above equation gives the following formula for ''P'' in terms of ''P''<sub>0</sub> and ''L''<sub>''P''</sub>:\n:<math>\nP = 10^\\frac{L_P}{10\\,\\text{dB}} P_0.\n</math>\n\n===Field quantities and root-power quantities===\n{{main|Power, root-power, and field quantities}}\nWhen referring to measurements of field quantities, it is usual to consider the ratio of the squares of ''F'' (measured field) and ''F''<sub>0</sub> (reference field). This is because in most applications power is proportional to the square of field, and historically their definitions were formulated to give the same value for relative ratios in such typical cases. Thus, the following definition is used:\n:<math>\nL_F = \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{F}{F_0}\\right)\\,\\text{Np} = 10 \\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{F^2}{F_0^2}\\right)\\,\\text{dB} = 20 \\log_{10} \\left(\\frac{F}{F_0}\\right)\\,\\text{dB}.\n</math>\n\nThe formula may be rearranged to give\n:<math>\nF = 10^\\frac{L_F}{20\\,\\text{dB}} F_0.\n</math>\n\nSimilarly, in [[Electronic circuit|electrical circuits]], dissipated power is typically proportional to the square of [[voltage]] or [[Electric current|current]] when the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] is constant. Taking voltage as an example, this leads to the equation for power gain level ''L''<sub>''G''</sub>:\n:<math>\nL_G = 20 \\log_{10}\\!\\left (\\frac{V_\\text{out}}{V_\\text{in}}\\right)\\,\\text{dB},\n</math>\nwhere ''V''<sub>out</sub> is the [[root-mean-square]] (rms) output voltage, ''V''<sub>in</sub> is the rms input voltage. A similar formula holds for current.\n\nThe term ''root-power quantity'' is introduced by ISO Standard [[ISO/IEC 80000|80000-1:2009]] as a substitute of ''field quantity''.  The term ''field quantity'' is deprecated by that standard.\n\n===Relationship between power level and field level===\nAlthough power and field quantities are different quantities, their respective levels are historically measured in the same units, typically decibels.  A factor of 2 is introduced to make ''changes'' in the respective levels match under restricted conditions such as when the medium is linear and the ''same'' waveform is under consideration with changes in amplitude, or the medium impedance is linear and independent of both frequency and time.  This relies on the relationship\n:<math> \\frac{P(t)}{P_0} = \\left(\\frac{F(t)}{F_0}\\right)^2 </math>\nholding.<ref>{{citation |author=I M Mills |author2=B N Taylor |author3=A J Thor |title=Definitions of the units radian, neper, bel and decibel |year=2001 |journal=Metrologia |volume=38 |page=353 |number=4 |doi=10.1088/0026-1394/38/4/8}}</ref>  In a nonlinear system, this relationship does not hold by the definition of linearity.  However, even in a [[linear system]] in which the power quantity is the product of two linearly related quantities (e.g. [[voltage]] and [[Electric current|current]]), if the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] is frequency- or time-dependent, this relationship does not hold in general, for example if the energy spectrum of the waveform changes.\n\nFor differences in level, the required relationship is relaxed from that above to one of proportionality (i.e., the reference quantities ''P''{{sub|0}} and ''F''{{sub|0}} need not be related), or equivalently,\n:<math> \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{F_2}{F_1}\\right)^2 </math>\nmust hold to allow the power level difference to be equal to the field level difference from power ''P''{{sub|1}} and ''V''{{sub|1}} to ''P''{{sub|2}} and ''V''{{sub|2}}.  An example might be an amplifier with unity voltage gain independent of load and frequency driving a load with a frequency-dependent impedance: the relative voltage gain of the amplifier is always 0&nbsp;dB, but the power gain depends on the changing spectral composition of the waveform being amplified.  Frequency-dependent impedances may be analyzed by considering the quantities [[power spectral density]] and the associated field quantities via the [[Fourier transform]], which allows elimination of the frequency dependence in the analysis by analyzing the system at each frequency independently.\n\n===Conversions===\n\n\nSince logarithm differences measured in these units are used to represent power ratios and field ratios, the values of the ratios represented by each unit are also included in the table.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Conversion between units of level and a list of corresponding ratios\n!Unit !!

A change in power ratio by a factor of 2 or {{frac|2}} is approximately a [[Half-power point|change of 3&nbsp;dB]]. More precisely, the change is \u00b13.0103&nbsp;dB, but this is almost universally rounded to \"3&nbsp;dB\" in technical writing.  This implies an increase in voltage by a factor of {{nowrap|{{sqrt|2}} \u2248 1.4142}}.  Likewise, a doubling or halving of the voltage, and quadrupling or quartering of the power, is commonly described as \"6&nbsp;dB\" rather than \u00b16.0206&nbsp;dB.\n\nShould it be necessary to make the distinction, the number of decibels is written with additional [[significant figures]].  3.000&nbsp;dB corresponds to a power ratio of 10<sup>{{frac|3|10}}</sup>, or 1.9953, about 0.24% different from exactly 2, and a voltage ratio of 1.4125, 0.12% different from exactly {{sqrt|2}}.  Similarly, an increase of 6.000&nbsp;dB corresponds to the power ratio is {{nowrap|10<sup>{{frac|6|10}}</sup> \u2248 3.9811}}, about 0.5% different from 4.\n\n==Properties==\nThe decibel is useful for representing large ratios and for simplifying representation of multiplied effects such as attenuation from multiple sources along a signal chain. Its application in systems with additive effects is less intuitive.\n\n===Reporting large ratios===\nThe [[logarithmic scale]] nature of the decibel means that a very large range of ratios can be represented by a convenient number, in a manner similar to [[scientific notation]]. This allows one to clearly visualize huge changes of some quantity. See ''[[Bode plot]]'' and ''[[Semi-log plot]]''.  For example, 120&nbsp;dB SPL may be clearer than \"a trillion times more intense than the threshold of hearing\".\n\n===Representation of multiplication operations===\nLevel values in decibels can be added instead of multiplying the underlying power values, which means that the overall gain of a multi-component system, such as a series of [[amplifier]] stages, can be calculated by summing the gains in decibels of the individual components, rather than multiply the amplification factors; that is, {{nowrap|log(''A'' \u00d7 ''B'' \u00d7 ''C'') }}= log(''A'') + log(''B'') + log(''C''). Practically, this means that, armed only with the knowledge that 1&nbsp;dB is a power gain of approximately 26%, 3&nbsp;dB is approximately 2\u00d7 power gain, and 10&nbsp;dB is 10\u00d7 power gain, it is possible to determine the power ratio of a system from the gain in dB with only simple addition and multiplication. For example:\n*:A system consists of 3 amplifiers in series, with gains (ratio of power out to in) of 10&nbsp;dB, 8&nbsp;dB, and 7&nbsp;dB respectively, for a total gain of 25&nbsp;dB. Broken into combinations of 10, 3, and 1&nbsp;dB, this is:\n*:: 25&nbsp;dB = 10&nbsp;dB + 10&nbsp;dB + 3&nbsp;dB + 1&nbsp;dB + 1&nbsp;dB\n*:With an input of 1 watt, the output is approximately\n*:: 1&nbsp;W \u00d7 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1.26 \u00d7 1.26  \u2248 317.5&nbsp;W\n*: Calculated exactly, the output is 1&nbsp;W \u00d7 10<sup>{{frac|25|10}}</sup> = 316.2&nbsp;W. The approximate value has an error of only +0.4% with respect to the actual value, which is negligible given the precision of the values supplied and the accuracy of most measurement instrumentation.\nHowever, according to its critics, the decibel creates confusion, obscures reasoning, is more related to the era of [[slide rule]]s than to modern digital processing, and is cumbersome and difficult to interpret.<ref name=\"Hickling\">R.

To obtain the total, addition of decibel values is much more convenient than multiplication of the individual factors.\" However, for the same reason that humans excel at additive operation over multiplication, decibels are awkward in inherently additive operations:<ref>R.

Peters, ''Acoustics and Noise Control'', Routledge, 12 November 2013, 400 pages, p.&nbsp;13</ref> \"if two machines each individually produce a [[sound pressure]] level of, say, 90&nbsp;dB at a certain point, then when both are operating together we should expect the combined sound pressure level to increase to 93&nbsp;dB, but certainly not to 180&nbsp;dB!\"; \"suppose that the noise from a machine is measured (including the contribution of background noise) and found to be 87&nbsp;dBA but when the machine is switched off the background noise alone is measured as 83&nbsp;dBA.

(See also [[Stevens' power law]].)\n\n{{further|Sound pressure#Examples of sound pressure}}\n\n===Electronics===\nIn electronics, the decibel is often used to express power or amplitude ratios (as for [[Gain (electronics)|gains]]) in preference to [[arithmetic]] ratios or [[percent]]ages. One advantage is that the total decibel gain of a series of components (such as [[amplifier]]s and [[Attenuator (electronics)|attenuators]]) can be calculated simply by summing the decibel gains of the individual components. Similarly, in telecommunications, decibels denote signal gain or loss from a transmitter to a receiver through some medium ([[free space optical communication|free space]], [[waveguide]], [[coaxial cable]], [[fiber optics]], etc.) using a [[link budget]].\n\nThe decibel unit can also be combined with a reference level, often indicated via a suffix, to create an absolute unit of electric power. For example, it can be combined with \"m\" for \"milliwatt\" to produce the \"[[dBm]]\".  A power level of 0 dBm corresponds to one milliwatt, and 1 dBm is one decibel greater (about 1.259&nbsp;mW).\n\nIn professional audio specifications, a popular unit is the [[dBu]].  This is relative to the [[root mean square]] voltage which delivers 1&nbsp;mW (0&nbsp;dBm) into a 600-ohm resistor, or {{sqrt|1&nbsp;mW&times;600&nbsp;\u03a9 }}\u2248 0.775&nbsp;V<sub>RMS</sub>.  When used in a 600-ohm circuit (historically, the standard reference impedance in telephone circuits), dBu and dBm are [[#dBu or dBv|identical]].\n\n===Optics===\nIn an [[optical link]], if a known amount of [[Optics|optical]] power, in [[dBm]] (referenced to 1&nbsp;mW), is launched into a [[Optical fiber|fiber]], and the losses, in dB (decibels), of each component (e.g., connectors, splices, and lengths of fiber) are known, the overall link loss may be quickly calculated by addition and subtraction of decibel quantities.<ref>\n{{cite book\n | title = Fiber optic installer's field manual\n | author-first = Bob |author-last=Chomycz\n | publisher = McGraw-Hill Professional\n | year = 2000\n | isbn = 978-0-07-135604-6\n | pages = 123\u2013126\n | url = {{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=B810SYIAa4IC |page=123 }}\n }}</ref>\n\nIn spectrometry and optics, the [[absorbance|blocking unit]] used to measure [[optical density]] is equivalent to \u22121&nbsp;B.\n\n===Video and digital imaging===\nIn connection with video and digital [[image sensor]]s, decibels generally represent ratios of video voltages or digitized light intensities, using 20&nbsp;log of the ratio, even when the represented intensity (optical power) is directly proportional to the voltage generated by the sensor, not to its square, as in a [[CCD imager]] where response voltage is linear in intensity.<ref>\n{{Cite book\n | title = The Colour Image Processing Handbook\n | author = Stephen J.

Most commonly, quantities called \"dynamic range\" or \"signal-to-noise\" (of the camera) would be specified in 20&nbsp;log dB, but in related contexts (e.g. attenuation, gain, intensifier SNR, or rejection ratio) the term should be interpreted cautiously, as confusion of the two units can result in very large misunderstandings of the value.\n\nPhotographers typically use an alternative base-2 log unit, the [[F-number#Stops.2C f-stop conventions.2C and exposure|stop]], to describe light intensity ratios or dynamic range.\n\n=={{anchor|Suffixes}}Suffixes and reference values==\nSuffixes are commonly attached to the basic dB unit in order to indicate the reference value by which the ratio is calculated. For example, dBm indicates power measurement relative to 1&nbsp;milliwatt.\n\nIn cases where the unit value of the reference is stated, the decibel value is known as \"absolute\". If the unit value of the reference is not explicitly stated, as in the dB gain of an amplifier, then the decibel value is considered relative.\n\nThe SI does not permit attaching qualifiers to units, whether as suffix or prefix, other than standard [[SI prefix]]es.  Therefore, even though the decibel is accepted for use alongside [[SI units]], the practice of attaching a suffix to the basic dB unit, forming compound units such as dBm, dBu, dBA, etc., is not.<ref name=NIST2008>Thompson, A. and Taylor, B.

There is no general rule, with various discipline-specific practices. Sometimes the suffix is a unit symbol (\"W\",\"K\",\"m\"), sometimes it is a transliteration of a unit symbol (\"uV\" instead of \u03bcV for microvolt), sometimes it is an acronym for the unit's name (\"sm\" for square meter, \"m\" for milliwatt), other times it is a mnemonic for the type of quantity being calculated (\"i\" for antenna gain with respect to an isotropic antenna, \"\u03bb\" for anything normalized by the EM wavelength), or otherwise a general attribute or identifier about the nature of the quantity (\"A\" for [[A-weighting|A-weighted]] sound pressure level). The suffix is often connected with a [[hyphen]], as in \"dB{{nbhyph}}Hz\", or with a space, as in \"dB&nbsp;HL\", or with no intervening character, as in \"dBm\", or enclosed in parentheses, as in \"dB(sm)\".\n\n===Voltage===\nSince the decibel is defined with respect to power, not amplitude, conversions of voltage ratios to decibels must square the amplitude, or use the factor of 20 instead of 10, as discussed above.\n\n[[File:Relationship between dBu and dBm.png|thumb|upright=1.25|A schematic showing the relationship between [[dBu]] (the [[voltage source]]) and [[dBm]] (the power dissipated as [[heat]] by the 600&nbsp;\u03a9 [[resistor]])]]\n\n;dBV: dB(V<sub>[[root mean square|RMS]]</sub>)&nbsp;\u2013 [[volt]]age relative to 1&nbsp;volt, regardless of impedance.<ref name = \"clqgmk\">{{citation |url=http://designtools.analog.com/dt/dbconvert/dbconvert.html |publisher=Analog Devices |title=Utilities : V<sub>RMS</sub> / dBm / dBu / dBV calculator |access-date=2016-09-16}}</ref> This is used to measure microphone sensitivity, and also to specify the consumer [[Line level|line-level]] of {{nowrap|\u221210 dBV}}, in order to reduce manufacturing costs relative to equipment using a {{nowrap|+4 dBu}} line-level signal.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=TIfOAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22%E2%88%9210+dBV%22+%221+kHz%22#v=onepage&q=pickup&f=false|title=The Audio Expert: Everything You Need to Know About Audio|last=Winer|first=Ethan|publisher=Focal Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0-240-82100-9|location=|pages=107}}</ref>\n\n;dBu or dBv: [[root mean square|RMS]] [[volt]]age relative to {{nowrap|<math>\\sqrt{0.6}\\,\\text{V}\\, \\approx 0.7746\\,\\text{V}</math>.}} An [[root mean square|RMS]] voltage of 1&nbsp;V therefore corresponds to <math>20\\cdot\\log_{10}\\left ( \\frac{1\\,V_\\text{RMS}}{\\sqrt{0.6}\\,V} \\right )=2.218\\,\\text{dBu}.</math><ref name=\"clqgmk\" /> Originally dBv, it was changed to dBu to avoid confusion with dBV.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stason.org/TULARC/entertainment/audio/pro/3-3-What-is-the-difference-between-dBv-dBu-dBV-dBm-dB.html|title=3.3&nbsp;\u2013 What is the difference between dBv, dBu, dBV, dBm, dB SPL, and plain old dB?

Full-scale may be defined as the power level of a full-scale [[Sine wave|sinusoid]] or alternatively a full-scale [[square wave]]. A signal measured with reference to a full-scale sine-wave appears 3&nbsp;dB weaker when referenced to a full-scale square wave, thus: 0&nbsp;dBFS(fullscale sine wave) = \u22123&nbsp;dBFS(fullscale square wave).\n;dBG: G-weighted spectrum\n;dBi: dB(isotropic) \u2013 the forward [[Antenna gain|gain of an antenna]] compared with the hypothetical [[isotropic antenna]], which uniformly distributes energy in all directions. [[Linear polarization]] of the EM field is assumed unless noted otherwise.\n;dBiC: dB(isotropic circular) \u2013 the forward gain of an antenna compared to a [[Circular polarization|circularly polarized]] isotropic antenna. There is no fixed conversion rule between dBiC and dBi, as it depends on the receiving antenna and the field polarization.\n;dBJ: energy relative to 1 [[joule]]. 1 joule = 1 watt second = 1 watt per hertz, so [[power spectral density]] can be expressed in dBJ.\n;dBk: dB(kW) \u2013 power relative to 1 [[kilowatt]].\n;dBK:'''dB(K)''' \u2013 decibels relative to [[kelvin]]: Used to express [[noise temperature]].\n;[[dBm]]: dB(mW) \u2013 power relative to 1 [[milliwatt]]. \n;[[dBm0]]: Power in dBm measured at a zero transmission level point.\n;dBm0s: Defined by  Recommendation ITU-R V.574.\n;dBmV: dB(mV<sub>[[root mean square|RMS]]</sub>) \u2013 [[volt]]age relative to 1 millivolt across 75 \u03a9.\n;dBo: dB optical.

Rarely used, except in some marketing material. 0&nbsp;dBq = \u22120.85&nbsp;dBi\n;dBr: dB(relative) \u2013 simply a relative difference from something else, which is made apparent in context.  The difference of a filter's response to nominal levels, for instance.\n;[[dBrn]]: dB above [[reference noise]].  See also '''dBrnC'''\n;dBrnC: '''dBrnC''' represents an audio level measurement, typically in a telephone circuit, relative to the [[circuit noise level]], with the measurement of this level frequency-weighted by a standard C-message weighting filter.

These measurements usually refer to noise and its effects on humans and other animals, and they are widely used in industry while discussing noise control issues, regulations and environmental standards. Other variations that may be seen are dB<sub>A</sub> or [[A-weighting|dBA]].\n\n====Other suffixes====\n;dB-Hz: dB(Hz) \u2013 bandwidth relative to one hertz. \n;dB/K: dB(K<sup>\u22121</sup>) \u2013 decibels relative to [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of [[kelvin]]\n;dBm<sup>\u22121</sup>: dB(m<sup>\u22121</sup>) \u2013 decibel relative to reciprocal of meter: measure of the [[antenna factor]].\n\n==Related units==\n;mBm: mB(mW) \u2013 power relative to 1 [[milliwatt]], in millibels (one hundredth of a decibel). 100&nbsp;mBm = 1&nbsp;dBm.

Like the decibel, the neper is a unit of [[Level (logarithmic quantity)|level]].<ref name=\"standardization2006\"/>\n\n:<math>1\\ {\\rm Np} = 20 \\log_{10} e \\ {\\rm dB} \\approx 8{.}685889638 \\ {\\rm dB} \\, </math>\n\n==Fractions==\n[[Attenuation]] constants, in fields such as [[optical fiber]] communication and [[radio propagation]] [[path loss]], are often expressed as a [[Fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] or ratio to distance of transmission. dB/m represents decibel per meter, dB/mi represents decibel per mile, for example. These quantities are to be manipulated obeying the rules of [[dimensional analysis]], e.g., a 100-meter run with a 3.5&nbsp;dB/km fiber yields a loss of 0.35&nbsp;dB = 3.5&nbsp;dB/km \u00d7 0.1&nbsp;km.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Apparent magnitude]]\n* [[Cent (music)]]\n* [[dB drag racing]]\n* [[Decade (log scale)]]\n* [[Loudness]]\n* {{Section link|One-third octave|Base 10}}\n* [[pH]]\n* [[Phon]]\n* [[Richter magnitude scale]]\n* [[Sone]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite journal |author-last=Tuffentsammer |author-first=Karl |title=Das Dezilog, eine Br\u00fccke zwischen Logarithmen, Dezibel, Neper und Normzahlen |language=German |trans-title=The decilog, a bridge between logarithms, decibel, neper and preferred numbers |journal=VDI-Zeitschrift |volume=98 |date=1956 |pages=267\u2013274}}\n* {{cite book |title=Logarithmen, Normzahlen, Dezibel, Neper, Phon - nat\u00fcrlich verwandt! |language=German |trans-title=Logarithms, preferred numbers, decibel, neper, phon - naturally related! |author-first=Eugen |author-last=Paulin |date=2007-09-01 |url=http://www.rechenschieber.org/Normzahlen.pdf |access-date=2016-12-18 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161218223050/http://www.rechenschieber.org/Normzahlen.pdf |archive-date=2016-12-18}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/dB.html What is a decibel?

It is used to express the ratio of one value of a [[Power, root-power, and field quantities|power or field quantity]] to another, on a [[logarithmic scale]], the logarithmic quantity being called the power level or field level, respectively.\n\nIt can be used to express a change in value (e.g., +1&nbsp;dB or &minus;1&nbsp;dB) or an absolute value. In the latter case, it expresses the ratio of a value to a fixed reference value; when used in this way, a suffix that indicates the reference value is often appended to the decibel symbol. For example, if the reference value is 1&nbsp;[[volt]], then the suffix is \"[[#Voltage|V]]\" (e.g., \"20&nbsp;dBV\"), and if the reference value is one [[milliwatt]], then the suffix is \"[[dBm|m]]\" (e.g., \"20&nbsp;dBm\").<ref name=\"clqgmk\"/>\n\nTwo different scales are used when expressing a ratio in decibels, depending on the nature of the quantities: power and field (root-power). When expressing a power ratio, the number of decibels is ten times its [[Common logarithm|logarithm to base 10]].<ref>{{cite book |title=IEEE Standard 100: a dictionary of IEEE standards and terms |edition=7th |publisher=The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineering |location=New York |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-7381-2601-2 |page=288}}</ref> That is, a change in ''power'' by a factor of 10 corresponds to a 10&nbsp;dB change in level. When expressing field (root-power) quantities, a change in ''amplitude'' by a factor of 10 corresponds to a 20&nbsp;dB change in level. The decibel scales differ by a factor of two so that the related power and field levels change by the same number of decibels with linear loads.\n\nThe definition of the decibel is based on the measurement of power in [[telephony]] of the early 20th&nbsp;century in the [[Bell System]] in the United States. One decibel is one tenth ([[deci-]]) of one '''bel''', named in honor of [[Alexander Graham Bell]]; however, the bel is seldom used. Today, the decibel is used for a wide variety of measurements in science and [[engineering]], most prominently in [[acoustics]], [[electronics]], and [[control theory]]. In electronics, the [[Gain (electronics)|gain]]s of amplifiers, [[attenuation]] of signals, and [[signal-to-noise ratio]]s are often expressed in decibels.\n\nIn the [[International System of Quantities]], the decibel is defined as a unit of measurement for quantities of type [[Level (logarithmic quantity)|level]] or level difference, which are defined as the [[logarithm]] of the ratio of power- or field-type quantities.<ref name=\"standardization2006\">{{cite web |title=ISO 80000-3:2006 |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=31888 |publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization]] |access-date=2013-07-20 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|MSC|TU|bel}}History==\nThe decibel originates from methods used to quantify signal loss in telegraph and telephone circuits.

The introduction of cable in 1896 afforded a stable basis for a convenient unit and the \"mile of standard\" cable came into general use shortly thereafter. This unit was employed up to 1923 when a new unit was adopted as being more suitable for modern telephone work. The new transmission unit is widely used among the foreign telephone organizations and recently it was termed the \"decibel\" at the suggestion of the International Advisory Committee on Long Distance Telephony.\n\nThe decibel may be defined by the statement that two amounts of power differ by 1 decibel when they are in the ratio of 10<sup>0.1</sup> and any two amounts of power differ by ''N'' decibels when they are in the ratio of 10<sup>''N''(0.1)</sup>. The number of transmission units expressing the ratio of any two powers is therefore ten times the common logarithm of that ratio. This method of designating the gain or loss of power in telephone circuits permits direct addition or subtraction of the units expressing the efficiency of different parts of the circuit&nbsp;...}}\n\nIn 1954, J. W. Horton argued that the use of the decibel as a unit for quantities other than transmission loss led to confusion, and suggested the name ''logit'' for \"standard magnitudes which combine by multiplication\", to contrast with the name ''unit'' for \"standard magnitudes which combine by addition\".<ref>{{cite journal |first=J.

The bel (B) is {{1/2}}&nbsp;ln(10) [[neper]]s: {{nowrap|1=1 B = {{1/2}} ln(10) Np}}. The neper is the change in the [[level (logarithmic quantity)|level]] of a field quantity when the field quantity changes by a factor of [[e (mathematical constant)|''e'']], that is {{nowrap|1=1 Np = ln(e) = 1}}, thereby relating all of the units as nondimensional natural log of field-quantity ratios, {{nowrap|1=1 dB = 0.11513\u2026 Np = 0.11513\u2026}}.  Finally, the level of a quantity is the logarithm of the ratio of the value of that quantity to a reference value of the same kind of quantity.\n\nTherefore, the bel represents the logarithm of a ratio between two power quantities of 10:1, or the logarithm of a ratio between two field quantities of {{radic|10}}:1.<ref>{{cite book |title=International Standard CEI-IEC 27-3 |chapter=Letter symbols to be used in electrical technology |at=Part 3: Logarithmic quantities and units |publisher=International Electrotechnical Commission}}</ref>\n\nTwo signals whose levels differ by one decibel have a power ratio of 10<sup>1/10</sup>, which is approximately 1.25893, and an amplitude (field quantity) ratio of 10<sup>{{frac|20}}</sup> (1.12202).<ref>{{cite book |author-last=Mark |author-first=James E. |title=Physical Properties of Polymers Handbook |publisher=Springer |date=2007 |page=1025 |quote=[\u2026] the decibel represents a reduction in power of 1.258 times [\u2026]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author-last=Yost |author-first=William |title=Fundamentals of Hearing: An Introduction |url=https://archive.org/details/fundamentalsofhe00yost |url-access=registration |publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston |edition=Second |date=1985 |page=[https://archive.org/details/fundamentalsofhe00yost/page/206 206] |isbn=978-0-12-772690-8 |quote=[\u2026] a pressure ratio of 1.122 equals + 1.0 dB [\u2026]}}</ref>\n\nThe bel is rarely used either without a prefix or with [[metric prefix|SI unit prefixes]] other than ''[[deci-|deci]]''; it is preferred, for example, to use ''hundredths of a decibel'' rather than ''millibels''.

Thus, the ratio of ''P'' (measured power) to ''P''<sub>0</sub> (reference power) is represented by ''L''<sub>''P''</sub>, that ratio expressed in decibels,<ref>{{Cite book |title=Microwave Engineering |author-first=David M. |author-last=Pozar |edition=3rd |publisher=Wiley |date=2005 |isbn=978-0-471-44878-5 |page=63}}</ref> which is calculated using the formula:<ref>IEC 60027-3:2002</ref>\n\n:<math>\nL_P = \\frac{1}{2} \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{P}{P_0}\\right)\\,\\text{Np} = 10 \\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{P}{P_0}\\right)\\,\\text{dB}.\n</math>\n\nThe base-10 logarithm of the ratio of the two power quantities is the number of bels. The number of decibels is ten times the number of bels (equivalently, a decibel is one-tenth of a bel).  ''P'' and ''P''<sub>0</sub> must measure the same type of quantity, and have the same units before calculating the ratio. If {{nowrap|1=''P'' = ''P''<sub>0</sub>}} in the above equation, then ''L''<sub>''P''</sub> = 0. If ''P'' is greater than ''P''<sub>0</sub> then ''L''<sub>''P''</sub> is positive; if ''P'' is less than ''P''<sub>0</sub> then ''L''<sub>''P''</sub> is negative.\n\nRearranging the above equation gives the following formula for ''P'' in terms of ''P''<sub>0</sub> and ''L''<sub>''P''</sub>:\n:<math>\nP = 10^\\frac{L_P}{10\\,\\text{dB}} P_0.\n</math>\n\n===Field quantities and root-power quantities===\n{{main|Power, root-power, and field quantities}}\nWhen referring to measurements of field quantities, it is usual to consider the ratio of the squares of ''F'' (measured field) and ''F''<sub>0</sub> (reference field). This is because in most applications power is proportional to the square of field, and historically their definitions were formulated to give the same value for relative ratios in such typical cases. Thus, the following definition is used:\n:<math>\nL_F = \\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{F}{F_0}\\right)\\,\\text{Np} = 10 \\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{F^2}{F_0^2}\\right)\\,\\text{dB} = 20 \\log_{10} \\left(\\frac{F}{F_0}\\right)\\,\\text{dB}.\n</math>\n\nThe formula may be rearranged to give\n:<math>\nF = 10^\\frac{L_F}{20\\,\\text{dB}} F_0.\n</math>\n\nSimilarly, in [[Electronic circuit|electrical circuits]], dissipated power is typically proportional to the square of [[voltage]] or [[Electric current|current]] when the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] is constant. Taking voltage as an example, this leads to the equation for power gain level ''L''<sub>''G''</sub>:\n:<math>\nL_G = 20 \\log_{10}\\!\\left (\\frac{V_\\text{out}}{V_\\text{in}}\\right)\\,\\text{dB},\n</math>\nwhere ''V''<sub>out</sub> is the [[root-mean-square]] (rms) output voltage, ''V''<sub>in</sub> is the rms input voltage. A similar formula holds for current.\n\nThe term ''root-power quantity'' is introduced by ISO Standard [[ISO/IEC 80000|80000-1:2009]] as a substitute of ''field quantity''.  The term ''field quantity'' is deprecated by that standard.\n\n===Relationship between power level and field level===\nAlthough power and field quantities are different quantities, their respective levels are historically measured in the same units, typically decibels.  A factor of 2 is introduced to make ''changes'' in the respective levels match under restricted conditions such as when the medium is linear and the ''same'' waveform is under consideration with changes in amplitude, or the medium impedance is linear and independent of both frequency and time.  This relies on the relationship\n:<math> \\frac{P(t)}{P_0} = \\left(\\frac{F(t)}{F_0}\\right)^2 </math>\nholding.<ref>{{citation |author=I M Mills |author2=B N Taylor |author3=A J Thor |title=Definitions of the units radian, neper, bel and decibel |year=2001 |journal=Metrologia |volume=38 |page=353 |number=4 |doi=10.1088/0026-1394/38/4/8}}</ref>  In a nonlinear system, this relationship does not hold by the definition of linearity.  However, even in a [[linear system]] in which the power quantity is the product of two linearly related quantities (e.g. [[voltage]] and [[Electric current|current]]), if the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] is frequency- or time-dependent, this relationship does not hold in general, for example if the energy spectrum of the waveform changes.\n\nFor differences in level, the required relationship is relaxed from that above to one of proportionality (i.e., the reference quantities ''P''{{sub|0}} and ''F''{{sub|0}} need not be related), or equivalently,\n:<math> \\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \\left(\\frac{F_2}{F_1}\\right)^2 </math>\nmust hold to allow the power level difference to be equal to the field level difference from power ''P''{{sub|1}} and ''V''{{sub|1}} to ''P''{{sub|2}} and ''V''{{sub|2}}.  An example might be an amplifier with unity voltage gain independent of load and frequency driving a load with a frequency-dependent impedance: the relative voltage gain of the amplifier is always 0&nbsp;dB, but the power gain depends on the changing spectral composition of the waveform being amplified.  Frequency-dependent impedances may be analyzed by considering the quantities [[power spectral density]] and the associated field quantities via the [[Fourier transform]], which allows elimination of the frequency dependence in the analysis by analyzing the system at each frequency independently.\n\n===Conversions===\n\n\nSince logarithm differences measured in these units are used to represent power ratios and field ratios, the values of the ratios represented by each unit are also included in the table.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Conversion between units of level and a list of corresponding ratios\n!Unit !!

A change in power ratio by a factor of 2 or {{frac|2}} is approximately a [[Half-power point|change of 3&nbsp;dB]]. More precisely, the change is \u00b13.0103&nbsp;dB, but this is almost universally rounded to \"3&nbsp;dB\" in technical writing.  This implies an increase in voltage by a factor of {{nowrap|{{sqrt|2}} \u2248 1.4142}}.  Likewise, a doubling or halving of the voltage, and quadrupling or quartering of the power, is commonly described as \"6&nbsp;dB\" rather than \u00b16.0206&nbsp;dB.\n\nShould it be necessary to make the distinction, the number of decibels is written with additional [[significant figures]].  3.000&nbsp;dB corresponds to a power ratio of 10<sup>{{frac|3|10}}</sup>, or 1.9953, about 0.24% different from exactly 2, and a voltage ratio of 1.4125, 0.12% different from exactly {{sqrt|2}}.  Similarly, an increase of 6.000&nbsp;dB corresponds to the power ratio is {{nowrap|10<sup>{{frac|6|10}}</sup> \u2248 3.9811}}, about 0.5% different from 4.\n\n==Properties==\nThe decibel is useful for representing large ratios and for simplifying representation of multiplied effects such as attenuation from multiple sources along a signal chain. Its application in systems with additive effects is less intuitive.\n\n===Reporting large ratios===\nThe [[logarithmic scale]] nature of the decibel means that a very large range of ratios can be represented by a convenient number, in a manner similar to [[scientific notation]]. This allows one to clearly visualize huge changes of some quantity. See ''[[Bode plot]]'' and ''[[Semi-log plot]]''.  For example, 120&nbsp;dB SPL may be clearer than \"a trillion times more intense than the threshold of hearing\".\n\n===Representation of multiplication operations===\nLevel values in decibels can be added instead of multiplying the underlying power values, which means that the overall gain of a multi-component system, such as a series of [[amplifier]] stages, can be calculated by summing the gains in decibels of the individual components, rather than multiply the amplification factors; that is, {{nowrap|log(''A'' \u00d7 ''B'' \u00d7 ''C'') }}= log(''A'') + log(''B'') + log(''C''). Practically, this means that, armed only with the knowledge that 1&nbsp;dB is a power gain of approximately 26%, 3&nbsp;dB is approximately 2\u00d7 power gain, and 10&nbsp;dB is 10\u00d7 power gain, it is possible to determine the power ratio of a system from the gain in dB with only simple addition and multiplication. For example:\n*:A system consists of 3 amplifiers in series, with gains (ratio of power out to in) of 10&nbsp;dB, 8&nbsp;dB, and 7&nbsp;dB respectively, for a total gain of 25&nbsp;dB. Broken into combinations of 10, 3, and 1&nbsp;dB, this is:\n*:: 25&nbsp;dB = 10&nbsp;dB + 10&nbsp;dB + 3&nbsp;dB + 1&nbsp;dB + 1&nbsp;dB\n*:With an input of 1 watt, the output is approximately\n*:: 1&nbsp;W \u00d7 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1.26 \u00d7 1.26  \u2248 317.5&nbsp;W\n*: Calculated exactly, the output is 1&nbsp;W \u00d7 10<sup>{{frac|25|10}}</sup> = 316.2&nbsp;W. The approximate value has an error of only +0.4% with respect to the actual value, which is negligible given the precision of the values supplied and the accuracy of most measurement instrumentation.\nHowever, according to its critics, the decibel creates confusion, obscures reasoning, is more related to the era of [[slide rule]]s than to modern digital processing, and is cumbersome and difficult to interpret.<ref name=\"Hickling\">R.

To obtain the total, addition of decibel values is much more convenient than multiplication of the individual factors.\" However, for the same reason that humans excel at additive operation over multiplication, decibels are awkward in inherently additive operations:<ref>R. J. Peters, ''Acoustics and Noise Control'', Routledge, 12 November 2013, 400 pages, p.&nbsp;13</ref> \"if two machines each individually produce a [[sound pressure]] level of, say, 90&nbsp;dB at a certain point, then when both are operating together we should expect the combined sound pressure level to increase to 93&nbsp;dB, but certainly not to 180&nbsp;dB!\"; \"suppose that the noise from a machine is measured (including the contribution of background noise) and found to be 87&nbsp;dBA but when the machine is switched off the background noise alone is measured as 83&nbsp;dBA.

The reference pressure for sound in air is set at the typical threshold of perception of an average human and there are [[Sound pressure#Examples of sound pressure|common comparisons used to illustrate different levels of sound pressure]].

S. Clay (1999), Underwater sound transmission and SI units, J Acoust Soc Am 106, 3047</ref>\n\nThe human ear has a large [[dynamic range]] in sound reception. The ratio of the sound intensity that causes permanent damage during short exposure to that of the quietest sound that the ear can hear is greater than or equal to 1 trillion (10<sup>12</sup>).<ref>{{citation |publisher=National Institute on Deafness and Other Communications Disorders |url=http://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/hearing/noise.asp |title=Noise-Induced Hearing Loss |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509092930/https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/hearing/noise.asp |archive-date=9 May 2016 |date=2008}}</ref> Such large measurement ranges are conveniently expressed in [[logarithmic scale]]: the base-10 logarithm of 10<sup>12</sup> is 12, which is expressed as a sound pressure level of 120&nbsp;dB re 20&nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|\u03bcPa]].\n\nSince the human ear is not equally sensitive to all sound frequencies, noise levels at maximum human sensitivity, somewhere between 2 and 4&nbsp;[[hertz|kHz]], are factored more heavily into some measurements using [[frequency weighting]]. (See also [[Stevens' power law]].)\n\n{{further|Sound pressure#Examples of sound pressure}}\n\n===Electronics===\nIn electronics, the decibel is often used to express power or amplitude ratios (as for [[Gain (electronics)|gains]]) in preference to [[arithmetic]] ratios or [[percent]]ages. One advantage is that the total decibel gain of a series of components (such as [[amplifier]]s and [[Attenuator (electronics)|attenuators]]) can be calculated simply by summing the decibel gains of the individual components. Similarly, in telecommunications, decibels denote signal gain or loss from a transmitter to a receiver through some medium ([[free space optical communication|free space]], [[waveguide]], [[coaxial cable]], [[fiber optics]], etc.) using a [[link budget]].\n\nThe decibel unit can also be combined with a reference level, often indicated via a suffix, to create an absolute unit of electric power. For example, it can be combined with \"m\" for \"milliwatt\" to produce the \"[[dBm]]\".  A power level of 0 dBm corresponds to one milliwatt, and 1 dBm is one decibel greater (about 1.259&nbsp;mW).\n\nIn professional audio specifications, a popular unit is the [[dBu]].  This is relative to the [[root mean square]] voltage which delivers 1&nbsp;mW (0&nbsp;dBm) into a 600-ohm resistor, or {{sqrt|1&nbsp;mW&times;600&nbsp;\u03a9 }}\u2248 0.775&nbsp;V<sub>RMS</sub>.  When used in a 600-ohm circuit (historically, the standard reference impedance in telephone circuits), dBu and dBm are [[#dBu or dBv|identical]].\n\n===Optics===\nIn an [[optical link]], if a known amount of [[Optics|optical]] power, in [[dBm]] (referenced to 1&nbsp;mW), is launched into a [[Optical fiber|fiber]], and the losses, in dB (decibels), of each component (e.g., connectors, splices, and lengths of fiber) are known, the overall link loss may be quickly calculated by addition and subtraction of decibel quantities.<ref>\n{{cite book\n | title = Fiber optic installer's field manual\n | author-first = Bob |author-last=Chomycz\n | publisher = McGraw-Hill Professional\n | year = 2000\n | isbn = 978-0-07-135604-6\n | pages = 123\u2013126\n | url = {{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=B810SYIAa4IC |page=123 }}\n }}</ref>\n\nIn spectrometry and optics, the [[absorbance|blocking unit]] used to measure [[optical density]] is equivalent to \u22121&nbsp;B.\n\n===Video and digital imaging===\nIn connection with video and digital [[image sensor]]s, decibels generally represent ratios of video voltages or digitized light intensities, using 20&nbsp;log of the ratio, even when the represented intensity (optical power) is directly proportional to the voltage generated by the sensor, not to its square, as in a [[CCD imager]] where response voltage is linear in intensity.<ref>\n{{Cite book\n | title = The Colour Image Processing Handbook\n | author = Stephen J.

Most commonly, quantities called \"dynamic range\" or \"signal-to-noise\" (of the camera) would be specified in 20&nbsp;log dB, but in related contexts (e.g. attenuation, gain, intensifier SNR, or rejection ratio) the term should be interpreted cautiously, as confusion of the two units can result in very large misunderstandings of the value.\n\nPhotographers typically use an alternative base-2 log unit, the [[F-number#Stops.2C f-stop conventions.2C and exposure|stop]], to describe light intensity ratios or dynamic range.\n\n=={{anchor|Suffixes}}Suffixes and reference values==\nSuffixes are commonly attached to the basic dB unit in order to indicate the reference value by which the ratio is calculated. For example, dBm indicates power measurement relative to 1&nbsp;milliwatt.\n\nIn cases where the unit value of the reference is stated, the decibel value is known as \"absolute\". If the unit value of the reference is not explicitly stated, as in the dB gain of an amplifier, then the decibel value is considered relative.\n\nThe SI does not permit attaching qualifiers to units, whether as suffix or prefix, other than standard [[SI prefix]]es.  Therefore, even though the decibel is accepted for use alongside [[SI units]], the practice of attaching a suffix to the basic dB unit, forming compound units such as dBm, dBu, dBA, etc., is not.<ref name=NIST2008>Thompson, A. and Taylor, B.

There is no general rule, with various discipline-specific practices. Sometimes the suffix is a unit symbol (\"W\",\"K\",\"m\"), sometimes it is a transliteration of a unit symbol (\"uV\" instead of \u03bcV for microvolt), sometimes it is an acronym for the unit's name (\"sm\" for square meter, \"m\" for milliwatt), other times it is a mnemonic for the type of quantity being calculated (\"i\" for antenna gain with respect to an isotropic antenna, \"\u03bb\" for anything normalized by the EM wavelength), or otherwise a general attribute or identifier about the nature of the quantity (\"A\" for [[A-weighting|A-weighted]] sound pressure level). The suffix is often connected with a [[hyphen]], as in \"dB{{nbhyph}}Hz\", or with a space, as in \"dB&nbsp;HL\", or with no intervening character, as in \"dBm\", or enclosed in parentheses, as in \"dB(sm)\".\n\n===Voltage===\nSince the decibel is defined with respect to power, not amplitude, conversions of voltage ratios to decibels must square the amplitude, or use the factor of 20 instead of 10, as discussed above.\n\n[[File:Relationship between dBu and dBm.png|thumb|upright=1.25|A schematic showing the relationship between [[dBu]] (the [[voltage source]]) and [[dBm]] (the power dissipated as [[heat]] by the 600&nbsp;\u03a9 [[resistor]])]]\n\n;dBV: dB(V<sub>[[root mean square|RMS]]</sub>)&nbsp;\u2013 [[volt]]age relative to 1&nbsp;volt, regardless of impedance.<ref name = \"clqgmk\">{{citation |url=http://designtools.analog.com/dt/dbconvert/dbconvert.html |publisher=Analog Devices |title=Utilities : V<sub>RMS</sub> / dBm / dBu / dBV calculator |access-date=2016-09-16}}</ref> This is used to measure microphone sensitivity, and also to specify the consumer [[Line level|line-level]] of {{nowrap|\u221210 dBV}}, in order to reduce manufacturing costs relative to equipment using a {{nowrap|+4 dBu}} line-level signal.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=TIfOAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22%E2%88%9210+dBV%22+%221+kHz%22#v=onepage&q=pickup&f=false|title=The Audio Expert: Everything You Need to Know About Audio|last=Winer|first=Ethan|publisher=Focal Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0-240-82100-9|location=|pages=107}}</ref>\n\n;dBu or dBv: [[root mean square|RMS]] [[volt]]age relative to {{nowrap|<math>\\sqrt{0.6}\\,\\text{V}\\, \\approx 0.7746\\,\\text{V}</math>.}} An [[root mean square|RMS]] voltage of 1&nbsp;V therefore corresponds to <math>20\\cdot\\log_{10}\\left ( \\frac{1\\,V_\\text{RMS}}{\\sqrt{0.6}\\,V} \\right )=2.218\\,\\text{dBu}.</math><ref name=\"clqgmk\" /> Originally dBv, it was changed to dBu to avoid confusion with dBV.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stason.org/TULARC/entertainment/audio/pro/3-3-What-is-the-difference-between-dBv-dBu-dBV-dBm-dB.html|title=3.3&nbsp;\u2013 What is the difference between dBv, dBu, dBV, dBm, dB SPL, and plain old dB?

Chamberlain and his supporters believed war could be avoided and hoped Germany would agree to leave the rest of Poland alone. German [[hegemony]] over Central Europe was also at stake. In private, Hitler said in May that Danzig was not the important issue to him, but pursuit of ''[[Lebensraum]]'' for Germany.<ref>''A World at Total War: Global Conflict and the Politics of Destruction, 1937\u20131945'', Roger Chickering, Stig F\u00f6rster, Bernd Greiner, p. 97</ref>\n\n=== Breakdown of talks ===\nWith tensions mounting, Germany turned to aggressive diplomacy. On 28 April 1939, Hitler [[unilateral]]ly withdrew from both the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact of 1934 and the [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement]] of 1935. Talks over Danzig and the Corridor broke down and months passed without diplomatic interaction between Germany and Poland. During this interim period, the Germans learned that France and Britain had failed to secure an alliance with the Soviet Union against Germany, and that the Soviet Union was interested in an alliance with Germany against Poland. Hitler had already issued orders to prepare for a possible \"solution of the Polish problem by military means\" through the [[Fall Weiss (1939)|Case White]] scenario.\n\nIn May 1939, in a statement to his generals while they were in the midst of planning the invasion of Poland, Hitler made it clear that the invasion would not come without resistance as it had in Czechoslovakia:<ref name=\"Clark, Lloyd 2011, page 26\">Clark, Lloyd, ''Kursk: The Greatest Battle: Eastern Front 1943'', 2011, p. 26</ref>\n\n{{quote|With minor exceptions German national unification has been achieved.

We cannot expect a repetition of Czechoslovakia.

In fact, the Soviets agreed not to aid France or the UK in the event of their going to war with Germany over Poland and, in a secret protocol of the pact, the Germans and the Soviets agreed to divide Eastern Europe, including Poland, into two [[spheres of influence]]; the western one-third of the country was to go to Germany and the eastern two-thirds to the Soviet Union.\n\nThe German assault was originally scheduled to begin at 04:00 on 26 August. However, on 25 August, the [[Polish-British Common Defence Pact]] was signed as an annex to the [[Franco-Polish alliance (1921)]]. In this accord, Britain committed itself to the defence of Poland, guaranteeing to preserve Polish independence. At the same time, the British and the Poles were hinting to Berlin that they were willing to resume discussions\u2014not at all how Hitler hoped to frame the conflict. Thus, he wavered and postponed his attack until 1 September, managing to in effect halt the entire invasion \"in mid-leap\".\n[[File:Ribbentrop-Molotov.svg|thumb|left|Planned and actual divisions of Poland, according to the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]], with later adjustments|alt=Map showing the planned and actual divisions of Poland according to the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact.]]\n\nHowever, there was one exception: on the night of 25\u201326 August, a German sabotage group which had not heard anything about a delay of the invasion made an attack on the [[Jablunkov Pass]] and [[Mosty u Jablunkova|Mosty]] railway station in [[Silesia]]. On the morning of 26 August, this group was repelled by Polish troops. The German side described all this as an incident \"caused by an insane individual\" (see [[Jab\u0142onk\u00f3w incident]]).\n\nOn 26 August, Hitler tried to dissuade the British and the French from interfering in the upcoming conflict, even pledging that the ''Wehrmacht'' forces would be made available to Britain's empire in the future.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/psf/box31/t295s04.html|title=Home \u2013 FDR Presidential Library & Museum}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/psf/box31/a295s04.html|title=Home \u2013 FDR Presidential Library & Museum}}</ref> The negotiations convinced Hitler that there was little chance the Western Allies would declare war on Germany, and even if they did, because of the lack of \"territorial guarantees\" to Poland, they would be willing to negotiate a compromise favourable to Germany after its conquest of Poland. Meanwhile, the increased number of overflights by high-altitude [[reconnaissance aircraft]] and cross-border troop movements signaled that war was imminent.\n[[File:Second World War Europe.png|right|thumb|The map shows the beginning of World War II in September 1939 in a European context.]]\n\nOn 29 August, prompted by the British, Germany issued one last diplomatic offer, with ''Fall Weiss'' yet to be rescheduled. That evening, the German government responded in a communication that it aimed not only for the restoration of Danzig but also the Polish Corridor (which had not previously been part of Hitler's demands) in addition to the safeguarding of the [[German minority in Poland]]. It said that they were willing to commence negotiations, but indicated that a Polish representative with the power to sign an agreement had to arrive in Berlin the next day while in the meantime it would draw up a set of proposals.<ref>[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/wwii/blbk78.asp Reply of the German Chancellor to the Communication of 28 August 1939, from His Majesty's Government] Cited in the British Blue Book</ref> The British Cabinet was pleased that negotiations had been agreed to but, mindful of how [[Emil H\u00e1cha]] had been [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|forced to sign his country away]] under similar circumstances just months earlier, regarded the requirement for an immediate arrival of a Polish representative with full signing powers as an unacceptable [[ultimatum]].<ref>[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/wwii/blbk81.asp Viscount Halifax to Sir N.

It was then broadcast that Poland had rejected Germany's offer, and negotiations with Poland came to an end. Hitler issued orders for the invasion to commence soon afterwards.\n\nOn 29 August, Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs, [[J\u00f3zef Beck]] ordered military [[mobilization]], but under the pressure from Great Britain and France, the mobilization was cancelled. When the final mobilization started, it added to the confusion.<ref>Oslon and Cloud,\"A Question of Honor\" p. 50</ref>\n\nOn 30 August, the [[Polish Navy]] sent its destroyer [[flotilla]] to Britain, executing the [[Peking Plan]]. On the same day, [[Marshal of Poland]] [[Edward Rydz-\u015amig\u0142y]] announced the mobilization of Polish troops. However, he was pressured into revoking the order by the French, who apparently still hoped for a diplomatic settlement, failing to realize that the Germans were fully mobilized and concentrated at the Polish border.<ref>Seidner, Stanley S.

However, partly because of the earlier stoppage, Poland finally managed to mobilize only about 70% of its planned forces (only about 900,000 of 1,350,000 soldiers planned to mobilize in first order), and because of that many units were still forming or moving to their designated frontline positions. The late mobilization reduced combat capability of Polish Army by about 1/3.\n\n== Opposing forces ==\n{{See also|Opposing forces in the Polish September Campaign|Soviet order of battle for invasion of Poland in 1939|Slovak invasion of Poland}}\n\n=== Germany ===\n{{See also|German order of battle for the invasion of Poland}}\n\nGermany had a substantial numeric advantage over Poland and had developed a significant military before the conflict. The ''[[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Heer]]'' (army) had 3,472 [[tank]]s in its inventory, of which 2,859 were with the Field Army and 408 with the [[Replacement Army]].{{sfn|Jentz|1996|p=88}} 453 tanks were assigned into four light divisions, while another 225 tanks were in detached regiments and companies.{{sfn|Jentz|1996|p=91}}  Most notably, the Germans had seven ''[[Panzer]]'' divisions, with 2,009 tanks between them, utilizing a new [[operational doctrine]].{{sfn|Jentz|1996|pp=90\u201391}} It held that these divisions should act in coordination with other elements of the military, punching holes in the enemy line and isolating selected units, which would be [[Encirclement|encircled]] and destroyed. This would be followed up by less-mobile mechanized infantry and foot soldiers. The ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' (air force) provided both tactical and strategic [[air power]], particularly [[dive bomber]]s that disrupted lines of supply and communications. Together, the new methods were nicknamed \"''[[Blitzkrieg]]''\" (lightning war). While historian [[Basil Liddell Hart]] claimed \"Poland was a full demonstration of the ''Blitzkrieg'' theory\",<ref>B.H. Hart & A.J.P. Taylor, p. 41</ref> [[Invasion of Poland#Misconceptions|some other historians]] disagree.<ref name=Cooper0 />\n\n[[Aircraft]] played a major role in the campaign. [[Bomber aircraft|Bombers]] also attacked cities, causing huge losses amongst the civilian population through [[terror bombing]] and strafing. The ''Luftwaffe'' forces consisted of 1,180 [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]], 290 [[Junkers Ju 87|Ju 87 ''Stuka'']] [[dive bomber]]s, 1,100 conventional bombers (mainly [[Heinkel He 111]]s and [[Dornier Do 17]]s), and an assortment of 550 transport and 350 reconnaissance aircraft.<ref>Bombers of the Luftwaffe, Joachim Dressel and Manfred Griehl, Arms and Armour, 1994</ref><ref>The Flying pencil, Heinz J.

The partitioning powers did not invest in the development of industry, especially in the armaments industry in ethnically Polish areas. Moreover, Poland had to deal with damage caused by [[World War I]]. This resulted in the need to build a defense industry from scratch. Between 1936 and 1939, Poland invested heavily in the newly created [[Centralny Okr\u0119g Przemys\u0142owy|Central Industrial Region]]. Preparations for a defensive war with Germany were ongoing for many years, but most plans assumed fighting would not begin before 1942. To raise funds for industrial development, Poland sold much of the modern equipment it produced.<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz Rydz and the defence of Poland'', p. 177</ref> In 1936, a [[Fundusz Obrony Narodowej|National Defence Fund]] was set up to collect funds necessary for strengthening the Polish Armed forces. The [[Polish Army]] had approximately a million soldiers, but not all were mobilized by 1 September. Latecomers sustained significant casualties when public transport became targets of the ''Luftwaffe''. The Polish military had fewer armored forces than the Germans, and these units, dispersed within the infantry, were unable to effectively engage the Germans.<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz Rydz and the defence of Poland'', pp. 270\u201394</ref>\n\nExperiences in the [[Polish\u2013Soviet War]] shaped Polish Army organizational and operational doctrine. Unlike the [[trench warfare]] of [[World War I]], the Polish\u2013Soviet War was a conflict in which the [[cavalry]]'s mobility played a decisive role.<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz Rydz and the defence of Poland'', pp. 135\u2013138</ref> Poland acknowledged the benefits of mobility but was unable to invest heavily in many of the expensive, unproven inventions since then.

The Polish Air Force consisted of a 'Bomber Brigade', 'Pursuit Brigade' and aircraft assigned to the various ground armies.<ref>'Duel for the Sky' by Christopher Shores</ref> The Polish fighters were older than their German counterparts; the PZL P.11 fighter\u2014produced in the early 1930s\u2014had a top speed of only {{convert|365|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, far less than German bombers.

As a \"last minute\" order in the summer of 1939, Poland bought 160 French [[Morane-Saulnier M.S.406]] fighters and 111 English airplanes (100 light bombers [[Fairey Battle]], 10 [[Hawker Hurricane|Hurricanes]] and 1 [[Supermarine Spitfire]]; the sale of 150 Spitfires asked by the Polish government was rejected by the Air Ministry).<ref name=\"Wojciech Mazur\">{{cite journal |last1=Mazur |first1=Wojciech |title=Pomocnik Historyczny |journal=Polityka |date=March 2009 |volume=3/2009 |page=103}}</ref> Despite the fact that some of the airplanes had been shipped to Poland (the first transport of purchased aircraft on the ship \"Lassel\" sailed from Liverpool on 28 August 1939<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.plus-minus.net.pl/PomocPolsce/UnitedKingdom/index1.html | title=1::Pomoc wojenna Imperium Brytyjskiego dla Polski w okresie II Wojny \u015aWIATOWEJ}}</ref>), none of them would take part in combat.

It called for the start of hostilities before a [[declaration of war]], and pursued a doctrine of mass encirclement and destruction of enemy forces. The infantry\u2014far from completely mechanized but fitted with fast-moving artillery and logistic support\u2014was to be supported by ''Panzers'' and small numbers of truck-mounted infantry (the ''Sch\u00fctzen'' regiments, forerunners of the ''[[panzergrenadier]]s'') to assist the rapid movement of troops and concentrate on [[Schwerpunkt|localized parts]] of the enemy [[Military front|front]], eventually isolating segments of the enemy, surrounding, and destroying them. The pre-war \"armored idea\" (which an American journalist in 1939 dubbed ''Blitzkrieg'')\u2014which was advocated by some generals, including [[Heinz Guderian]]\u2014would have had the armor punching holes in the enemy's front and ranging deep into rear areas; in actuality, the campaign in Poland would be fought along more traditional lines. This stemmed from conservatism on the part of the German high command, who mainly restricted the role of armor and mechanized forces to supporting the conventional infantry divisions.\n\nPoland's terrain was well suited for mobile operations when the weather cooperated; the country had flat [[plain]]s with long frontiers totalling almost {{convert|5600|km|mi|abbr=on}}, Poland's long border with Germany on the west and north\u2014facing East Prussia\u2014extended {{convert|2000|km|mi|abbr=on}}.

Colonel General [[Fedor von Bock]] commanded Army Group North, comprising General [[Georg von K\u00fcchler]]'s 3rd Army, which was to strike southward from East Prussia, and General [[G\u00fcnther von Kluge]]'s 4th Army, which was to attack eastward across the base of the [[Polish Corridor]].\n* A tertiary attack by part of Army Group South's allied [[Slovak Republic (1939\u20131945)|Slovak]] units from Slovakia.\n* From within Poland, the German minority would assist by engaging in diversion and sabotage operations through ''[[Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz]]'' units prepared before the war.\n\nAll three assaults were to converge on [[Warsaw]], while the main Polish army was to be encircled and destroyed west of the [[Vistula]]. ''Fall Weiss'' was initiated on 1 September 1939, and was the first operation of [[European Theatre of World War II|Second World War in Europe]].\n\n=== Polish defence plan ===\n[[File:Dywizje wrzesien 1.png|thumb|right|Deployment of German, Polish, and Slovak divisions immediately before the German invasion.|alt=Map showing deployment of German, Polish, and Slovak divisions on 1 September 1939, immediately before the German invasion.]]\n\nThe Polish determination to deploy forces directly at the German-Polish border, prompted by the [[Polish-British Common Defence Pact]], shaped the country's defence plan, \"[[Plan West]]\". Poland's most valuable natural resources, industry and population were located along the western border in [[Silesian Voivodeship (1920\u20131939)|Eastern Upper Silesia]]. Polish policy centred on their protection especially since many politicians feared that if Poland were to retreat from the regions disputed by Germany, Britain and France would sign a separate peace treaty with Germany similar to the [[Munich Agreement]] of 1938.<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz and the defence of Poland'', pp. 68\u201372</ref> The fact that none of Poland's allies had specifically guaranteed Polish borders or [[territorial integrity]] didn't help in easing Polish concerns. For these reasons, the Polish government disregarded French advice to deploy the bulk of its forces behind natural barriers such as the [[Vistula]] and [[San (river)|San]] rivers, even though some Polish generals supported it as a better strategy. The West Plan did permit the Polish armies to retreat inside the country, but it was supposed to be a slow retreat behind prepared positions and was intended to give the armed forces time to complete its mobilization and execute a general [[counteroffensive]] with the support of the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]].<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz Rydz and the defence of Poland'', pp. 122\u201325</ref>\n\nIn the case of a failure to defend the most of the territory, the army was to retreat to the south-east of the country, where the rough terrain, the [[Stryi River|Stryj]] and [[Dniestr]] rivers, valleys, hills and swamps would provide natural lines of defence against the [[Nazi Germany|German]] advance and [[Romanian Bridgehead]] could be created.\n[[File:Polish P-11 camouflaged in airfield 1939.jpg|thumb|left|A camouflaged Polish P-11 fighter at a combat airfield|alt=A photo of a Polish P-11 fighter covered in camouflage netting at an unidentified combat airfield]]\n\nThe Polish General Staff had not begun elaborating the \"West\" defence plan until 4 March 1939. It was assumed that the Polish Army, fighting in the initial phase of the war alone, would be compelled to defend the western regions of the country. The plan of operations took into account, first of all, the numerical and material superiority of the enemy and, consequently, assumed the defensive character of Polish operations. The Polish intentions were: defence of the western regions judged as indispensable for waging the war, taking advantage of the propitious conditions for counterattacks by reserve units, and avoidance of being smashed before the beginning of Franco/British operations in Western Europe. The [[operation plan|operational plan]] had not been elaborated in detail and concerned only the first stage of operations.<ref name=\"Wojna Obronna\" />\n\nThe British and French estimated that Poland would be able to defend itself for two to three months, while Poland estimated it could do so for at least six months. While Poland drafted its estimates based upon the expectation that the Western Allies would honor their treaty obligations and quickly start an offensive of their own, the French and British expected the war to develop into [[trench warfare]] much like World War I. The Polish government was not notified of this strategy and based all of its defence plans on promises of quick relief by their Western allies.<ref name=\"Pi\u0105tkowski\">{{cite book | author =Henryk Pi\u0105tkowski | title =Kampania wrze\u015bniowa 1939 roku w Polsce | year =1943 | page =39 | publisher =Sekcja Wydawnicza APW | location =Jerusalem | url =http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~antora/WYDAW/KAMPANIA/tekst/KAMPANIA1.HTM | accessdate =2 November 2011 | language =pl | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20080209164014/http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~antora/WYDAW/KAMPANIA/tekst/KAMPANIA1.HTM | archive-date =9 February 2008 | url-status =dead }}</ref><ref name=\"Raczy\u0144ski\">{{cite book | author=Count [[Edward Raczy\u0144ski (1891\u20131993)|Edward Raczy\u0144ski]] | title = The British-Polish Alliance; Its Origin and Meaning | year =1948 | publisher=Mellville Press | location = London }}</ref>\n\nPolish forces were stretched thinly along the Polish-German border and lacked compact defence lines and good defence positions along disadvantageous terrain. This strategy also left [[supply line]]s poorly protected. One-third of Poland's forces were massed in or near the Polish Corridor, making them vulnerable to a [[Pincer movement|double envelopment]] from East Prussia and the west. Another third were concentrated in the north-central part of the country, between the major cities of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a and Warsaw.<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz and the defence of Poland'', pp. 304\u2013310</ref> The forward positioning of Polish forces vastly increased the difficulty of carrying out strategic maneuvers, compounded by inadequate mobility, as Polish units often lacked the ability to retreat from their defensive positions as they were being overrun by more mobile German mechanized formations.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n[[File:Peking.jpg|thumb|[[Peking Plan]]: Polish destroyers evacuate the Baltic Sea en route to the United Kingdom.|alt=Photo of three Polish destroyers executing the Peking Plan and evacuating to British before the start of the invasion.]]\n\nAs the prospect of conflict increased, the British government pressed Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz to evacuate the most modern elements of the Polish Navy from the Baltic Sea.<ref name=\"PN\" /> In the event of war the Polish military leaders realized that the ships which remained in the Baltic were likely to be quickly sunk by the Germans. Furthermore, the [[Danish straits]] were well within operating range of the German ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' and ''Luftwaffe'', so there was little chance of an evacuation plan succeeding if implemented after hostilities began. Four days after the signing of the Polish-British Common Defence Pact, three destroyers of the Polish Navy executed the Peking Plan and consequently evacuated to Great Britain.<ref name=\"PN\" />\n\nAlthough the Polish military had prepared for conflict, the civilian population remained largely unprepared. Polish pre-war [[propaganda]] emphasized that any German invasion would be easily repelled. Consequently, Polish defeats during the German invasion came as a shock to the civilian population.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> Lacking training for such a disaster, the civilian population panicked and retreated east, spreading chaos, lowering troop morale and making road transportation for Polish troops very difficult.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> The propaganda also had some negative consequences for the Polish troops themselves, whose communications, disrupted by German mobile units operating in the rear and civilians blocking roads, were further thrown into chaos by bizarre reports from Polish radio stations and newspapers, which often reported imaginary victories and other military operations. This led to some Polish troops being encircled or taking a stand against overwhelming odds, when they thought they were actually counterattacking or would soon receive reinforcements from other victorious areas.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n=== Phase 1: German invasion ===\n[[File:Poland2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Map showing the advances made by the Germans, and the disposition of all troops from 1 to 14 September|alt=Map showing the advance made by the Germans, and the disposition of German and Polish troops on 14 September 1939.]]\n\nFollowing several German-staged incidents (like the Gleiwitz incident, a part of [[Operation Himmler]]), which German propaganda used as a [[pretext]] to claim that German forces were acting in [[self-defence]], one of the first acts of war took place on 1 September 1939. At 04:45, the old German [[pre-dreadnought battleship]] ''[[German battleship Schleswig-Holstein|Schleswig-Holstein]]'' opened fire on the Polish military transit depot at [[Battle of Westerplatte|Westerplatte]] in the Free City of Danzig on the [[Baltic Sea]]. However, in many places German units crossed the Polish border even before 04.45. Around that time Luftwaffe attacked a number of military and civilian targets, including [[bombing of Wielu\u0144]], the first large scale city bombing of the war. At 08:00, German troops\u2014still without a formal declaration of war issued\u2014[[Battle of Mokra|attacked near the Polish village of Mokra]]. The [[Battle of the Border]] had begun. Later that day, the Germans attacked on Poland's western, southern and northern borders, while German aircraft began raids on Polish cities. The main axis of attack led eastwards from Germany through the western Polish border. Supporting attacks came from East Prussia in the north, and a joint German-Slovak tertiary attack by units ([[Field Army Bernol\u00e1k|Field Army \"Bernol\u00e1k\"]]) from the German-allied Slovak Republic in the south. All three assaults converged on the Polish capital of Warsaw.\n[[File:Zniszczenia1939 0.jpg|thumb|left|The city of [[Wielu\u0144]] destroyed by ''Luftwaffe'' bombing|alt=Aerial photo showing the city of Wielu\u0144, which was destroyed by ''Luftwaffe'' bombing on 1 September]]\n\nFrance and the UK declared war on Germany on 3 September, but [[Western betrayal|failed to provide any meaningful support]]. The German-French border saw only [[Saar Offensive|a few minor skirmishes]], although the majority of German forces, including 85% of their armoured forces, were engaged in Poland. Despite some Polish successes in minor border battles, German technical, operational and numerical superiority forced the Polish armies to retreat from the borders towards Warsaw and [[Lw\u00f3w]]. The ''Luftwaffe'' gained [[air superiority]] early in the campaign. By destroying communications, the ''Luftwaffe'' increased the pace of the advance which overran Polish airstrips and early warning sites, causing logistical problems for the Poles. Many [[Polish Air Force]] units ran low on supplies, 98 of their number withdrew into then-neutral Romania.<ref name=\"E.R Hooton, p87\" /> The Polish initial strength of 400 was reduced to 54 by 14 September and air opposition virtually ceased,<ref name=\"E.R Hooton, p87\" /> with the main Polish air bases destroyed in the first 48 hours of the war.<ref name=\"gunther1940\">{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.149663/2015.149663.Inside-Europe#page/n13/mode/2up | title=Inside Europe | publisher=Harper & Brothers |location=New York|authorlink=John Gunther| author=Gunther, John | year=1940 | pages=xvi\u2013xvii}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-S55480, Polen, Parade vor Adolf Hitler.jpg|thumb|Hitler watching German soldiers marching into Poland in September 1939.]]\n\nGermany attacked from three directions on land.

At the same time, Guderian led his 3rd Army tanks across the Narew, attacking the line of the [[Bug River]], already encircling Warsaw. All the German armies made progress in fulfilling their parts of the ''Fall Weiss'' plan. The Polish armies were splitting up into uncoordinated fragments, some of which were retreating while others were launching disjointed attacks on the nearest German columns.\n\n[[File:Komancza 1939 onet.1.09.2010.jpg|thumb|Cheerful German and [[Slovak invasion of Poland|Slovak soldiers]] posing with a group of civilians in [[Koma\u0144cza]], September 1939.]]\nPolish forces abandoned the regions of [[Pomerelia]] (the Polish Corridor), [[Greater Poland]] and [[Silesian Voivodeship (1920\u20131939)|Polish Upper Silesia]] in the first week. The Polish plan for border defence was proven a dismal failure. The German advance as a whole was not slowed. On 10 September, the Polish commander-in-chief\u2014Marshal Edward Rydz-\u015amig\u0142y\u2014ordered a [[Withdrawal (military)|general retreat]] to the southeast, towards the Romanian Bridgehead.<ref name=\"Stanley S 1977, pp. 29\" /> Meanwhile, the Germans were tightening their encirclement of the Polish forces west of the Vistula (in the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a area and, still farther west, around [[Pozna\u0144]]) and also penetrating deeply into eastern Poland.

Around that time, advanced German forces also reached the city of [[Lw\u00f3w]], a major [[metropolis]] in eastern Poland. 1,150 German aircraft bombed Warsaw on 24 September.\n\n[[File:Polish artillery Battle of Bzura 1939.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A bombed Polish Army column during the [[Battle of the Bzura]]|alt=A bombed Polish Army column during the Battle of the Bzura.]]\nThe Polish defensive plan called for a strategy of encirclement: they were to allow the Germans to advance in between two Polish Army groups in the line between Berlin and Warsaw-Lodz, at which point [[Armia Prusy]] would move in and repulse the German spearhead, trapping them. In order for this to happen, Armia Prusy needed to be fully mobilized by 3 September.

The German troops left the area, and the Red Army troops entered Lviv on 22 September.\n\nThe Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop pact and the invasion of Poland marked the beginning of a period during which the government of the Soviet Union increasingly tried to convince itself that the actions of Germany were reasonable, and were not developments to be worried about, despite evidence to the contrary.<ref>Clark, Lloyd, ''Kursk: The greatest battle: Eastern Front 1943'', 2011, pp. 62, 67, 76\u201380</ref> On 7 September 1939, just a few days after France and Britain joined the war against Germany, Stalin explained to a colleague that the war was to the advantage of the Soviet Union, as follows:<ref name=\"Clark, Lloyd 2011, page 62\">Clark, Lloyd, ''Kursk: The greatest battle: Eastern Front 1943'', 2011, p. 62</ref>\n\n{{quote|A war is on between two groups of capitalist countries ... for the redivision of the world, for the domination of the world!

It would be months before Hitler would see the futility of his peace negotiation attempts with the United Kingdom and France, but the culmination of combined European and Pacific conflicts would result in what was truly a \"world war\". Thus, what was not seen by most politicians and generals in 1939 is clear from the historical perspective: The Polish September Campaign marked the beginning of a pan-European war, which combined with the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion of China]] in 1937 and the [[Pacific War]] in 1941 to form the global conflict known as World War II.\n\nThe invasion of Poland led Britain and France to declare war on Germany on 3 September. However, they did little to affect the outcome of the September Campaign. No declaration of war was issued by Britain and France against the Soviet Union. This lack of direct help led many Poles to believe that they had been [[Western betrayal#Up to 1939|betrayed by their Western allies]].

In 1939, only 10% of the Polish army was made up of cavalry units.<ref>Henryk Smaczny, ''Ksi\u0119ga kawalerii polskiej'' (\"Book of Polish cavalry\"), TESCO, Warszawa 1989, {{ISBN|83-00-02555-3}}</ref> [[Polish cavalry]] never charged German tanks or entrenched infantry or artillery, but usually acted as [[Mounted infantry|mobile infantry]] (like [[dragoon]]s) and reconnaissance units, and executed cavalry charges only in rare situations against foot soldiers.

The last cavalry-vs-cavalry battle in Europe was fought between German and Polish cavalries ([[Battle of Krasnobr\u00f3d (1939)]]). Polish cavalry consisted of 11 [[brigade]]s, equipped with [[Anti-tank rifle, model 35|\"UR\" anti-tank rifles]] and light artillery such as the highly effective [[Bofors 37 mm]] anti-tank gun. The myth originated from war correspondents' reports similar to that of the [[Charge at Krojanty|Battle of Krojanty]], where a Polish cavalry brigade was fired upon in ambush by hidden armored vehicles, after it had mounted a successful sabre-charge against German infantry. There were also cases when Polish cavalry dashing between tanks trying to break out of encirclement gave an impression of an attack.<ref group=\"Note\">Seidner takes issue here with this contention on at least one occasion.

Though numerically inferior, it had been redeployed from major air bases to small camouflaged airfields shortly before the war. Only some [[trainer aircraft|trainers]] and auxiliary aircraft were destroyed on the ground. The Polish Air Force, despite being significantly outnumbered and with its fighters outmatched by more advanced German fighters, remained active until the second week of the campaign, inflicting significant damage on the ''Luftwaffe''.<ref>Steven J.

Visible shattered window.]]\n\n=== First use of ''Blitzkrieg'' strategy ===\nIt is often assumed that '' Blitzkrieg'' is the strategy that Germany first used in Poland. Many early post-war histories, such as Barrie Pitt's in ''The Second World War'' (BPC Publishing 1966), attribute German victory to \"enormous development in military technique which occurred between 1918 and 1940\", and cite that \"Germany, who translated (British inter-war) theories into action... called the result ''Blitzkrieg''\". That idea has been repudiated by some authors. Matthew Cooper writes:\n\n{{quote|\"Throughout the Polish Campaign, the employment of the mechanized units revealed the idea that they were intended solely to ease the advance and to support the activities of the infantry.... Thus, any strategic exploitation of the armoured idea was still-born. The paralysis of command and the breakdown of morale were not made the ultimate aim of the{{nbs}}... German ground and air forces, and were only incidental by-products of the traditional manoeuvers of rapid encirclement and of the supporting activities of the flying artillery of the ''Luftwaffe'', both of which had as their purpose the physical destruction of the enemy troops. Such was the ''[[Vernichtungsgedanke]]'' of the Polish campaign.\" \u2013 Cooper<ref name=\"Cooper176\" />|sign=|source=}}\n\n''[[Vernichtungsgedanke]]'' was a strategy dating back to [[Frederick the Great]], and it was applied in the Polish Campaign, little changed from the [[Franco-Prussian War|French campaigns in 1870]] or 1914. The use of [[tank]]s\n\n{{quote|...left much to be desired... Fear of enemy action against the flanks of the advance, fear which was to prove so disastrous to German prospects in the west in 1940 and in the Soviet Union in 1941, was present from the beginning of the war. \u2013 Cooper<ref name=Cooper0 />}}\n\nJohn Ellis, writing in ''[[Brute Force (book)|Brute Force]]'', asserted that\n\n{{quote|...there is considerable justice in Matthew Cooper's assertion that the ''panzer'' divisions were not given the kind of ''strategic'' mission that was to characterize authentic armoured ''blitzkrieg'', and were almost always closely subordinated to the various mass infantry armies. \u2013 Ellis<ref>Ellis, John (1999). ''Brute Force: Allied Strategy and Tactics in the Second World War'', pp. 3\u20134</ref> (emphasis in original)}}\n\nZaloga and Madej, in ''The Polish Campaign 1939'', also address the subject of mythical interpretations of ''Blitzkrieg'' and the importance of other arms in the campaign. Western accounts of the September campaign have stressed the shock value of the ''panzers'' and ''Stuka'' attacks, they have\n\n{{quote|...tended to underestimate the punishing effect of German artillery on Polish units.

As the Wehrmacht advanced, Polish forces withdrew from their forward bases of operation close to the [[Germany\u2013Poland border]] to more established [[defense line]]s to the east. After the mid-September Polish defeat in the [[Battle of the Bzura]], the Germans gained an undisputed advantage. Polish forces then [[Plan West|withdrew to the southeast]] where they prepared for a long defence of the [[Romanian Bridgehead]] and awaited expected support and relief from [[French Third Republic|France]] and the [[United Kingdom]].<ref name=\"Balisze\" /> Those two countries had pacts with Poland and had declared war on Germany on 3 September; in the end their aid to Poland was very limited, however France invaded a small part of Germany in the [[Saar Offensive]].\n\nOn 17 September, the Soviet [[Red Army]] [[Soviet invasion of Poland|invaded]] [[Kresy|Eastern Poland]], the territory beyond the [[Curzon Line]] that fell into the Soviet \"[[sphere of influence]]\" according to the secret protocol of the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact; this rendered the Polish plan of defence obsolete.<ref name=\"WIF2\" /> Facing a second front, the Polish government concluded the defence of the Romanian Bridgehead was no longer feasible and ordered an emergency evacuation of all troops to neutral [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]].{{sfn|Sanford|2005|pp=20\u201324}} On 6 October, following the Polish defeat at the [[Battle of Kock (1939)|Battle of Kock]], German and Soviet forces gained full control over Poland.

The Soviet Union [[Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union|incorporated its newly acquired areas]] into its constituent [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Byelorussian]] and [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian]] [[Republics of the Soviet Union|republics]], and immediately started a campaign of [[Sovietization]].

On 28 April 1939, Hitler [[unilateral]]ly withdrew from both the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact of 1934 and the [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement]] of 1935. Talks over Danzig and the Corridor broke down and months passed without diplomatic interaction between Germany and Poland. During this interim period, the Germans learned that France and Britain had failed to secure an alliance with the Soviet Union against Germany, and that the Soviet Union was interested in an alliance with Germany against Poland. Hitler had already issued orders to prepare for a possible \"solution of the Polish problem by military means\" through the [[Fall Weiss (1939)|Case White]] scenario.\n\nIn May 1939, in a statement to his generals while they were in the midst of planning the invasion of Poland, Hitler made it clear that the invasion would not come without resistance as it had in Czechoslovakia:<ref name=\"Clark, Lloyd 2011, page 26\">Clark, Lloyd, ''Kursk: The Greatest Battle: Eastern Front 1943'', 2011, p. 26</ref>\n\n{{quote|With minor exceptions German national unification has been achieved.

In fact, the Soviets agreed not to aid France or the UK in the event of their going to war with Germany over Poland and, in a secret protocol of the pact, the Germans and the Soviets agreed to divide Eastern Europe, including Poland, into two [[spheres of influence]]; the western one-third of the country was to go to Germany and the eastern two-thirds to the Soviet Union.\n\nThe German assault was originally scheduled to begin at 04:00 on 26 August. However, on 25 August, the [[Polish-British Common Defence Pact]] was signed as an annex to the [[Franco-Polish alliance (1921)]]. In this accord, Britain committed itself to the defence of Poland, guaranteeing to preserve Polish independence. At the same time, the British and the Poles were hinting to Berlin that they were willing to resume discussions\u2014not at all how Hitler hoped to frame the conflict. Thus, he wavered and postponed his attack until 1 September, managing to in effect halt the entire invasion \"in mid-leap\".\n[[File:Ribbentrop-Molotov.svg|thumb|left|Planned and actual divisions of Poland, according to the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]], with later adjustments|alt=Map showing the planned and actual divisions of Poland according to the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact.]]\n\nHowever, there was one exception: on the night of 25\u201326 August, a German sabotage group which had not heard anything about a delay of the invasion made an attack on the [[Jablunkov Pass]] and [[Mosty u Jablunkova|Mosty]] railway station in [[Silesia]]. On the morning of 26 August, this group was repelled by Polish troops. The German side described all this as an incident \"caused by an insane individual\" (see [[Jab\u0142onk\u00f3w incident]]).\n\nOn 26 August, Hitler tried to dissuade the British and the French from interfering in the upcoming conflict, even pledging that the ''Wehrmacht'' forces would be made available to Britain's empire in the future.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/psf/box31/t295s04.html|title=Home \u2013 FDR Presidential Library & Museum}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/psf/box31/a295s04.html|title=Home \u2013 FDR Presidential Library & Museum}}</ref> The negotiations convinced Hitler that there was little chance the Western Allies would declare war on Germany, and even if they did, because of the lack of \"territorial guarantees\" to Poland, they would be willing to negotiate a compromise favourable to Germany after its conquest of Poland. Meanwhile, the increased number of overflights by high-altitude [[reconnaissance aircraft]] and cross-border troop movements signaled that war was imminent.\n[[File:Second World War Europe.png|right|thumb|The map shows the beginning of World War II in September 1939 in a European context.]]\n\nOn 29 August, prompted by the British, Germany issued one last diplomatic offer, with ''Fall Weiss'' yet to be rescheduled. That evening, the German government responded in a communication that it aimed not only for the restoration of Danzig but also the Polish Corridor (which had not previously been part of Hitler's demands) in addition to the safeguarding of the [[German minority in Poland]]. It said that they were willing to commence negotiations, but indicated that a Polish representative with the power to sign an agreement had to arrive in Berlin the next day while in the meantime it would draw up a set of proposals.<ref>[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/wwii/blbk78.asp Reply of the German Chancellor to the Communication of 28 August 1939, from His Majesty's Government] Cited in the British Blue Book</ref> The British Cabinet was pleased that negotiations had been agreed to but, mindful of how [[Emil H\u00e1cha]] had been [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|forced to sign his country away]] under similar circumstances just months earlier, regarded the requirement for an immediate arrival of a Polish representative with full signing powers as an unacceptable [[ultimatum]].<ref>[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/wwii/blbk81.asp Viscount Halifax to Sir N.

It was then broadcast that Poland had rejected Germany's offer, and negotiations with Poland came to an end. Hitler issued orders for the invasion to commence soon afterwards.\n\nOn 29 August, Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs, [[J\u00f3zef Beck]] ordered military [[mobilization]], but under the pressure from Great Britain and France, the mobilization was cancelled. When the final mobilization started, it added to the confusion.<ref>Oslon and Cloud,\"A Question of Honor\" p. 50</ref>\n\nOn 30 August, the [[Polish Navy]] sent its destroyer [[flotilla]] to Britain, executing the [[Peking Plan]]. On the same day, [[Marshal of Poland]] [[Edward Rydz-\u015amig\u0142y]] announced the mobilization of Polish troops. However, he was pressured into revoking the order by the French, who apparently still hoped for a diplomatic settlement, failing to realize that the Germans were fully mobilized and concentrated at the Polish border.<ref>Seidner, Stanley S.

However, partly because of the earlier stoppage, Poland finally managed to mobilize only about 70% of its planned forces (only about 900,000 of 1,350,000 soldiers planned to mobilize in first order), and because of that many units were still forming or moving to their designated frontline positions. The late mobilization reduced combat capability of Polish Army by about 1/3.\n\n== Opposing forces ==\n{{See also|Opposing forces in the Polish September Campaign|Soviet order of battle for invasion of Poland in 1939|Slovak invasion of Poland}}\n\n=== Germany ===\n{{See also|German order of battle for the invasion of Poland}}\n\nGermany had a substantial numeric advantage over Poland and had developed a significant military before the conflict. The ''[[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Heer]]'' (army) had 3,472 [[tank]]s in its inventory, of which 2,859 were with the Field Army and 408 with the [[Replacement Army]].{{sfn|Jentz|1996|p=88}} 453 tanks were assigned into four light divisions, while another 225 tanks were in detached regiments and companies.{{sfn|Jentz|1996|p=91}}  Most notably, the Germans had seven ''[[Panzer]]'' divisions, with 2,009 tanks between them, utilizing a new [[operational doctrine]].{{sfn|Jentz|1996|pp=90\u201391}} It held that these divisions should act in coordination with other elements of the military, punching holes in the enemy line and isolating selected units, which would be [[Encirclement|encircled]] and destroyed. This would be followed up by less-mobile mechanized infantry and foot soldiers. The ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' (air force) provided both tactical and strategic [[air power]], particularly [[dive bomber]]s that disrupted lines of supply and communications. Together, the new methods were nicknamed \"''[[Blitzkrieg]]''\" (lightning war). While historian [[Basil Liddell Hart]] claimed \"Poland was a full demonstration of the ''Blitzkrieg'' theory\",<ref>B.H. Hart & A.J.P.

[[Bomber aircraft|Bombers]] also attacked cities, causing huge losses amongst the civilian population through [[terror bombing]] and strafing. The ''Luftwaffe'' forces consisted of 1,180 [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]], 290 [[Junkers Ju 87|Ju 87 ''Stuka'']] [[dive bomber]]s, 1,100 conventional bombers (mainly [[Heinkel He 111]]s and [[Dornier Do 17]]s), and an assortment of 550 transport and 350 reconnaissance aircraft.<ref>Bombers of the Luftwaffe, Joachim Dressel and Manfred Griehl, Arms and Armour, 1994</ref><ref>The Flying pencil, Heinz J.

The partitioning powers did not invest in the development of industry, especially in the armaments industry in ethnically Polish areas. Moreover, Poland had to deal with damage caused by [[World War I]]. This resulted in the need to build a defense industry from scratch. Between 1936 and 1939, Poland invested heavily in the newly created [[Centralny Okr\u0119g Przemys\u0142owy|Central Industrial Region]]. Preparations for a defensive war with Germany were ongoing for many years, but most plans assumed fighting would not begin before 1942. To raise funds for industrial development, Poland sold much of the modern equipment it produced.<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz Rydz and the defence of Poland'', p. 177</ref> In 1936, a [[Fundusz Obrony Narodowej|National Defence Fund]] was set up to collect funds necessary for strengthening the Polish Armed forces. The [[Polish Army]] had approximately a million soldiers, but not all were mobilized by 1 September. Latecomers sustained significant casualties when public transport became targets of the ''Luftwaffe''. The Polish military had fewer armored forces than the Germans, and these units, dispersed within the infantry, were unable to effectively engage the Germans.<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz Rydz and the defence of Poland'', pp. 270\u201394</ref>\n\nExperiences in the [[Polish\u2013Soviet War]] shaped Polish Army organizational and operational doctrine. Unlike the [[trench warfare]] of [[World War I]], the Polish\u2013Soviet War was a conflict in which the [[cavalry]]'s mobility played a decisive role.<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz Rydz and the defence of Poland'', pp. 135\u2013138</ref> Poland acknowledged the benefits of mobility but was unable to invest heavily in many of the expensive, unproven inventions since then.

It called for the start of hostilities before a [[declaration of war]], and pursued a doctrine of mass encirclement and destruction of enemy forces. The infantry\u2014far from completely mechanized but fitted with fast-moving artillery and logistic support\u2014was to be supported by ''Panzers'' and small numbers of truck-mounted infantry (the ''Sch\u00fctzen'' regiments, forerunners of the ''[[panzergrenadier]]s'') to assist the rapid movement of troops and concentrate on [[Schwerpunkt|localized parts]] of the enemy [[Military front|front]], eventually isolating segments of the enemy, surrounding, and destroying them. The pre-war \"armored idea\" (which an American journalist in 1939 dubbed ''Blitzkrieg'')\u2014which was advocated by some generals, including [[Heinz Guderian]]\u2014would have had the armor punching holes in the enemy's front and ranging deep into rear areas; in actuality, the campaign in Poland would be fought along more traditional lines. This stemmed from conservatism on the part of the German high command, who mainly restricted the role of armor and mechanized forces to supporting the conventional infantry divisions.\n\nPoland's terrain was well suited for mobile operations when the weather cooperated; the country had flat [[plain]]s with long frontiers totalling almost {{convert|5600|km|mi|abbr=on}}, Poland's long border with Germany on the west and north\u2014facing East Prussia\u2014extended {{convert|2000|km|mi|abbr=on}}. Those had been lengthened by another {{convert|300|km|mi|abbr=on}} on the southern side in the aftermath of the Munich Agreement of 1938. The German incorporation of [[Bohemia and Moravia]] and creation of the German [[puppet state]] of [[History of Slovakia#World War II|Slovakia]] meant that Poland's southern flank was also exposed.\n\nHitler demanded that Poland be conquered in six weeks, but German planners thought that it would require three months.<ref name=\"knickerbocker1941\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RwGwpIBHhgcC&lpg=PR2&pg=PA29#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Is Tomorrow Hitler's? 200 Questions On the Battle of Mankind | publisher=Reynal & Hitchcock | author=Knickerbocker, H.R. | year=1941 | pages=29\u201330| isbn=978-1-4179-9277-5 }}</ref> They intended to fully exploit their long border with the great enveloping manoeuver of ''Fall Weiss''. German units were to invade Poland from three directions:\n* A main attack over the western Polish border. This was to be carried out by Army Group South commanded by Colonel General [[Gerd von Rundstedt]], attacking from German [[Silesia]] and from the [[Moravia]]n and Slovak border: General [[Johannes Blaskowitz]]'s 8th Army was to drive eastward against [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]]; General [[Wilhelm List]]'s 14th Army was to push on toward [[Krak\u00f3w]] and to turn the Poles' [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]] flank; and General [[Walter von Reichenau]]'s 10th Army, in the centre with Army Group South's armor, was to deliver the decisive blow with a northeastward thrust into the heart of Poland.\n* A second route of attack from northern [[Prussia]]. Colonel General [[Fedor von Bock]] commanded Army Group North, comprising General [[Georg von K\u00fcchler]]'s 3rd Army, which was to strike southward from East Prussia, and General [[G\u00fcnther von Kluge]]'s 4th Army, which was to attack eastward across the base of the [[Polish Corridor]].\n* A tertiary attack by part of Army Group South's allied [[Slovak Republic (1939\u20131945)|Slovak]] units from Slovakia.\n* From within Poland, the German minority would assist by engaging in diversion and sabotage operations through ''[[Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz]]'' units prepared before the war.\n\nAll three assaults were to converge on [[Warsaw]], while the main Polish army was to be encircled and destroyed west of the [[Vistula]]. ''Fall Weiss'' was initiated on 1 September 1939, and was the first operation of [[European Theatre of World War II|Second World War in Europe]].\n\n=== Polish defence plan ===\n[[File:Dywizje wrzesien 1.png|thumb|right|Deployment of German, Polish, and Slovak divisions immediately before the German invasion.|alt=Map showing deployment of German, Polish, and Slovak divisions on 1 September 1939, immediately before the German invasion.]]\n\nThe Polish determination to deploy forces directly at the German-Polish border, prompted by the [[Polish-British Common Defence Pact]], shaped the country's defence plan, \"[[Plan West]]\". Poland's most valuable natural resources, industry and population were located along the western border in [[Silesian Voivodeship (1920\u20131939)|Eastern Upper Silesia]]. Polish policy centred on their protection especially since many politicians feared that if Poland were to retreat from the regions disputed by Germany, Britain and France would sign a separate peace treaty with Germany similar to the [[Munich Agreement]] of 1938.<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz and the defence of Poland'', pp. 68\u201372</ref> The fact that none of Poland's allies had specifically guaranteed Polish borders or [[territorial integrity]] didn't help in easing Polish concerns. For these reasons, the Polish government disregarded French advice to deploy the bulk of its forces behind natural barriers such as the [[Vistula]] and [[San (river)|San]] rivers, even though some Polish generals supported it as a better strategy. The West Plan did permit the Polish armies to retreat inside the country, but it was supposed to be a slow retreat behind prepared positions and was intended to give the armed forces time to complete its mobilization and execute a general [[counteroffensive]] with the support of the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]].<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz Rydz and the defence of Poland'', pp. 122\u201325</ref>\n\nIn the case of a failure to defend the most of the territory, the army was to retreat to the south-east of the country, where the rough terrain, the [[Stryi River|Stryj]] and [[Dniestr]] rivers, valleys, hills and swamps would provide natural lines of defence against the [[Nazi Germany|German]] advance and [[Romanian Bridgehead]] could be created.\n[[File:Polish P-11 camouflaged in airfield 1939.jpg|thumb|left|A camouflaged Polish P-11 fighter at a combat airfield|alt=A photo of a Polish P-11 fighter covered in camouflage netting at an unidentified combat airfield]]\n\nThe Polish General Staff had not begun elaborating the \"West\" defence plan until 4 March 1939. It was assumed that the Polish Army, fighting in the initial phase of the war alone, would be compelled to defend the western regions of the country. The plan of operations took into account, first of all, the numerical and material superiority of the enemy and, consequently, assumed the defensive character of Polish operations. The Polish intentions were: defence of the western regions judged as indispensable for waging the war, taking advantage of the propitious conditions for counterattacks by reserve units, and avoidance of being smashed before the beginning of Franco/British operations in Western Europe. The [[operation plan|operational plan]] had not been elaborated in detail and concerned only the first stage of operations.<ref name=\"Wojna Obronna\" />\n\nThe British and French estimated that Poland would be able to defend itself for two to three months, while Poland estimated it could do so for at least six months. While Poland drafted its estimates based upon the expectation that the Western Allies would honor their treaty obligations and quickly start an offensive of their own, the French and British expected the war to develop into [[trench warfare]] much like World War I. The Polish government was not notified of this strategy and based all of its defence plans on promises of quick relief by their Western allies.<ref name=\"Pi\u0105tkowski\">{{cite book | author =Henryk Pi\u0105tkowski | title =Kampania wrze\u015bniowa 1939 roku w Polsce | year =1943 | page =39 | publisher =Sekcja Wydawnicza APW | location =Jerusalem | url =http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~antora/WYDAW/KAMPANIA/tekst/KAMPANIA1.HTM | accessdate =2 November 2011 | language =pl | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20080209164014/http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~antora/WYDAW/KAMPANIA/tekst/KAMPANIA1.HTM | archive-date =9 February 2008 | url-status =dead }}</ref><ref name=\"Raczy\u0144ski\">{{cite book | author=Count [[Edward Raczy\u0144ski (1891\u20131993)|Edward Raczy\u0144ski]] | title = The British-Polish Alliance; Its Origin and Meaning | year =1948 | publisher=Mellville Press | location = London }}</ref>\n\nPolish forces were stretched thinly along the Polish-German border and lacked compact defence lines and good defence positions along disadvantageous terrain. This strategy also left [[supply line]]s poorly protected. One-third of Poland's forces were massed in or near the Polish Corridor, making them vulnerable to a [[Pincer movement|double envelopment]] from East Prussia and the west. Another third were concentrated in the north-central part of the country, between the major cities of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a and Warsaw.<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz and the defence of Poland'', pp. 304\u2013310</ref> The forward positioning of Polish forces vastly increased the difficulty of carrying out strategic maneuvers, compounded by inadequate mobility, as Polish units often lacked the ability to retreat from their defensive positions as they were being overrun by more mobile German mechanized formations.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n[[File:Peking.jpg|thumb|[[Peking Plan]]: Polish destroyers evacuate the Baltic Sea en route to the United Kingdom.|alt=Photo of three Polish destroyers executing the Peking Plan and evacuating to British before the start of the invasion.]]\n\nAs the prospect of conflict increased, the British government pressed Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz to evacuate the most modern elements of the Polish Navy from the Baltic Sea.<ref name=\"PN\" /> In the event of war the Polish military leaders realized that the ships which remained in the Baltic were likely to be quickly sunk by the Germans. Furthermore, the [[Danish straits]] were well within operating range of the German ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' and ''Luftwaffe'', so there was little chance of an evacuation plan succeeding if implemented after hostilities began. Four days after the signing of the Polish-British Common Defence Pact, three destroyers of the Polish Navy executed the Peking Plan and consequently evacuated to Great Britain.<ref name=\"PN\" />\n\nAlthough the Polish military had prepared for conflict, the civilian population remained largely unprepared. Polish pre-war [[propaganda]] emphasized that any German invasion would be easily repelled. Consequently, Polish defeats during the German invasion came as a shock to the civilian population.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> Lacking training for such a disaster, the civilian population panicked and retreated east, spreading chaos, lowering troop morale and making road transportation for Polish troops very difficult.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> The propaganda also had some negative consequences for the Polish troops themselves, whose communications, disrupted by German mobile units operating in the rear and civilians blocking roads, were further thrown into chaos by bizarre reports from Polish radio stations and newspapers, which often reported imaginary victories and other military operations. This led to some Polish troops being encircled or taking a stand against overwhelming odds, when they thought they were actually counterattacking or would soon receive reinforcements from other victorious areas.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n=== Phase 1: German invasion ===\n[[File:Poland2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Map showing the advances made by the Germans, and the disposition of all troops from 1 to 14 September|alt=Map showing the advance made by the Germans, and the disposition of German and Polish troops on 14 September 1939.]]\n\nFollowing several German-staged incidents (like the Gleiwitz incident, a part of [[Operation Himmler]]), which German propaganda used as a [[pretext]] to claim that German forces were acting in [[self-defence]], one of the first acts of war took place on 1 September 1939. At 04:45, the old German [[pre-dreadnought battleship]] ''[[German battleship Schleswig-Holstein|Schleswig-Holstein]]'' opened fire on the Polish military transit depot at [[Battle of Westerplatte|Westerplatte]] in the Free City of Danzig on the [[Baltic Sea]]. However, in many places German units crossed the Polish border even before 04.45. Around that time Luftwaffe attacked a number of military and civilian targets, including [[bombing of Wielu\u0144]], the first large scale city bombing of the war. At 08:00, German troops\u2014still without a formal declaration of war issued\u2014[[Battle of Mokra|attacked near the Polish village of Mokra]]. The [[Battle of the Border]] had begun. Later that day, the Germans attacked on Poland's western, southern and northern borders, while German aircraft began raids on Polish cities. The main axis of attack led eastwards from Germany through the western Polish border. Supporting attacks came from East Prussia in the north, and a joint German-Slovak tertiary attack by units ([[Field Army Bernol\u00e1k|Field Army \"Bernol\u00e1k\"]]) from the German-allied Slovak Republic in the south. All three assaults converged on the Polish capital of Warsaw.\n[[File:Zniszczenia1939 0.jpg|thumb|left|The city of [[Wielu\u0144]] destroyed by ''Luftwaffe'' bombing|alt=Aerial photo showing the city of Wielu\u0144, which was destroyed by ''Luftwaffe'' bombing on 1 September]]\n\nFrance and the UK declared war on Germany on 3 September, but [[Western betrayal|failed to provide any meaningful support]].

Despite some Polish successes in minor border battles, German technical, operational and numerical superiority forced the Polish armies to retreat from the borders towards Warsaw and [[Lw\u00f3w]]. The ''Luftwaffe'' gained [[air superiority]] early in the campaign. By destroying communications, the ''Luftwaffe'' increased the pace of the advance which overran Polish airstrips and early warning sites, causing logistical problems for the Poles.

At the same time, Guderian led his 3rd Army tanks across the Narew, attacking the line of the [[Bug River]], already encircling Warsaw.

It would be months before Hitler would see the futility of his peace negotiation attempts with the United Kingdom and France, but the culmination of combined European and Pacific conflicts would result in what was truly a \"world war\". Thus, what was not seen by most politicians and generals in 1939 is clear from the historical perspective: The Polish September Campaign marked the beginning of a pan-European war, which combined with the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion of China]] in 1937 and the [[Pacific War]] in 1941 to form the global conflict known as World War II.\n\nThe invasion of Poland led Britain and France to declare war on Germany on 3 September. However, they did little to affect the outcome of the September Campaign. No declaration of war was issued by Britain and France against the Soviet Union. This lack of direct help led many Poles to believe that they had been [[Western betrayal#Up to 1939|betrayed by their Western allies]].

Polish cavalry consisted of 11 [[brigade]]s, equipped with [[Anti-tank rifle, model 35|\"UR\" anti-tank rifles]] and light artillery such as the highly effective [[Bofors 37 mm]] anti-tank gun.

Visible shattered window.]]\n\n=== First use of ''Blitzkrieg'' strategy ===\nIt is often assumed that '' Blitzkrieg'' is the strategy that Germany first used in Poland. Many early post-war histories, such as Barrie Pitt's in ''The Second World War'' (BPC Publishing 1966), attribute German victory to \"enormous development in military technique which occurred between 1918 and 1940\", and cite that \"Germany, who translated (British inter-war) theories into action... called the result ''Blitzkrieg''\". That idea has been repudiated by some authors. Matthew Cooper writes:\n\n{{quote|\"Throughout the Polish Campaign, the employment of the mechanized units revealed the idea that they were intended solely to ease the advance and to support the activities of the infantry.... Thus, any strategic exploitation of the armoured idea was still-born. The paralysis of command and the breakdown of morale were not made the ultimate aim of the{{nbs}}... German ground and air forces, and were only incidental by-products of the traditional manoeuvers of rapid encirclement and of the supporting activities of the flying artillery of the ''Luftwaffe'', both of which had as their purpose the physical destruction of the enemy troops. Such was the ''[[Vernichtungsgedanke]]'' of the Polish campaign.\" \u2013 Cooper<ref name=\"Cooper176\" />|sign=|source=}}\n\n''[[Vernichtungsgedanke]]'' was a strategy dating back to [[Frederick the Great]], and it was applied in the Polish Campaign, little changed from the [[Franco-Prussian War|French campaigns in 1870]] or 1914. The use of [[tank]]s\n\n{{quote|...left much to be desired... Fear of enemy action against the flanks of the advance, fear which was to prove so disastrous to German prospects in the west in 1940 and in the Soviet Union in 1941, was present from the beginning of the war. \u2013 Cooper<ref name=Cooper0 />}}\n\nJohn Ellis, writing in ''[[Brute Force (book)|Brute Force]]'', asserted that\n\n{{quote|...there is considerable justice in Matthew Cooper's assertion that the ''panzer'' divisions were not given the kind of ''strategic'' mission that was to characterize authentic armoured ''blitzkrieg'', and were almost always closely subordinated to the various mass infantry armies. \u2013 Ellis<ref>Ellis, John (1999). ''Brute Force: Allied Strategy and Tactics in the Second World War'', pp. 3\u20134</ref> (emphasis in original)}}\n\nZaloga and Madej, in ''The Polish Campaign 1939'', also address the subject of mythical interpretations of ''Blitzkrieg'' and the importance of other arms in the campaign. Western accounts of the September campaign have stressed the shock value of the ''panzers'' and ''Stuka'' attacks, they have\n\n{{quote|...tended to underestimate the punishing effect of German artillery on Polish units. Mobile and available in significant quantity, artillery shattered as many units as any other branch of the ''Wehrmacht''. \u2013 Zaloga and Madej<ref name=\"Cooper4\" />}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Eastern Front (World War II)]]\n* [[Polish resistance movement in World War II]]\n* [[History of Poland (1939\u20131945)]]\n* [[Horses in World War II]]\n* [[List of Polish divisions in World War II]]\n* [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)]]\n* [[Oder\u2013Neisse line]]\n* [[Phoney War]]\n* [[Polish cavalry brigade order of battle in 1939]]\n* [[Polish contribution to World War II]]\n* [[Siege of Warsaw (1939)]]\n* [[Timeline of the invasion of Poland]]\n* [[War crimes of the Wehrmacht]]\n* [[Western betrayal]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=Note}}\n\n== References ==\n<!--This article uses the Cite.php citation mechanism.

He is voiced by [[Dan Castellaneta]] and first appeared on television, along with the rest of his family, in ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'' [[The Simpsons shorts|short]] \"[[Good Night (The Simpsons short)|Good Night]]\" on April 19, 1987. Homer was created and designed by cartoonist [[Matt Groening]] while he was waiting in the lobby of [[James L. Brooks]]' office. Groening had been called to pitch a series of shorts based on his comic strip ''[[Life in Hell]]'' but instead decided to create a new set of characters. He named the character after his father, Homero Groening. After appearing for three seasons on ''The Tracey Ullman Show'', the Simpson family got their own series on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], which debuted December 17, 1989.\n\nAs patriarch of the [[Simpson family|eponymous family]], Homero and his wife [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] have three children: [[Bart Simpson|Bart]], [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] and [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]]. As the family's provider, he works at the [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield Nuclear Power Plant]] as safety inspector. Homero embodies many [[Working class in the United States|American working class]] stereotypes: he is crude, overweight, incompetent, lazy, selfish, balding, clumsy, dim-witted, hot-tempered, childish, and addicted to beer, junk food and watching television. However, he often tries his hardest to be a decent man and is fiercely devoted to his family, especially when they need him the most. Despite the suburban [[Blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] routine of his life, he has had a number of remarkable experiences, including going to [[Outer space|space]], climbing the tallest mountain in Springfield by himself, fighting former President [[George H. W. Bush]] and winning a [[Grammy Award]] as a member of a barbershop quartet.\n\nIn the shorts and earlier episodes, Castellaneta voiced Homero with a loose impression of [[Walter Matthau]]; however, during the second and third seasons of the half-hour show, Homer's voice evolved to become more robust, to allow the expression of a fuller range of emotions. He has appeared in other media relating to ''The Simpsons''\u2014including video games, ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'', [[The Simpsons Ride]], commercials, and comic books\u2014and inspired an entire line of merchandise. His signature catchphrase, the annoyed grunt \"[[D'oh!]]\", has been included in ''[[Oxford Dictionary of English|The New Oxford Dictionary of English]]'' since 1998 and the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' since 2001.\n\nHomer is one of the most influential characters in the history of television, and is widely considered to be an American [[cultural icon]]. The British newspaper ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' described him as \"The greatest comic creation of [modern] time\". He was named the greatest character \"of the last 20 years\" in 2010 by ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', was ranked the second-greatest cartoon character by ''[[TV Guide]]'', behind [[Bugs Bunny]], and was voted the greatest television character of all time by [[Channel 4]] viewers. For voicing Homer, Castellaneta has won four [[Primetime Emmy Awards]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance|Outstanding Voice-Over Performance]] and a special-achievement [[Annie Award]]. In 2000, Homer and his family were awarded a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].\n\n==Role in ''The Simpsons''==\nHomer Jay Simpson is the bumbling husband of Marge and father of Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson.{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=78\u201379}} He is the son of [[Mona Simpson (The Simpsons)|Mona]] and [[Grampa Simpson|Abraham \"Grampa\" Simpson]].

He is voiced by [[Dan Castellaneta]] and first appeared on television, along with the rest of his family, in ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'' [[The Simpsons shorts|short]] \"[[Good Night (The Simpsons short)|Good Night]]\" on April 19, 1987. Homer was created and designed by cartoonist [[Matt Groening]] while he was waiting in the lobby of [[James L. Brooks]]' office. Groening had been called to pitch a series of shorts based on his comic strip ''[[Life in Hell]]'' but instead decided to create a new set of characters. He named the character after his father, Homer Groening. After appearing for three seasons on ''The Tracey Ullman Show'', the Simpson family got their own series on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], which debuted December 17, 1989.\n\nAs patriarch of the [[Simpson family|eponymous family]], Homer and his wife [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] have three children: [[Bart Simpson|Bart]], [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] and [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]]. As the family's provider, he works at the [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield Nuclear Power Plant]] as safety inspector. Homer embodies many [[Working class in the United States|American working class]] stereotypes: he is crude, overweight, incompetent, lazy, selfish, balding, clumsy, dim-witted, hot-tempered, childish, and addicted to beer, junk food and watching television. However, he often tries his hardest to be a decent man and is fiercely devoted to his family, especially when they need him the most. Despite the suburban [[Blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] routine of his life, he has had a number of remarkable experiences, including going to [[Outer space|space]], climbing the tallest mountain in Springfield by himself, fighting former President [[George H. W. Bush]] and winning a [[Grammy Award]] as a member of a barbershop quartet.\n\nIn the shorts and earlier episodes, Castellaneta voiced Homer with a loose impression of [[Walter Matthau]]; however, during the second and third seasons of the half-hour show, Homer's voice evolved to become more robust, to allow the expression of a fuller range of emotions. He has appeared in other media relating to ''The Simpsons''\u2014including video games, ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'', [[The Simpsons Ride]], commercials, and comic books\u2014and inspired an entire line of merchandise. His signature catchphrase, the annoyed grunt \"[[D'oh!]]\", has been included in ''[[Oxford Dictionary of English|The New Oxford Dictionary of English]]'' since 1998 and the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' since 2001.\n\nHomer is one of the most influential characters in the history of television, and is widely considered to be an American [[cultural icon]]. The British newspaper ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' described him as \"The greatest comic creation of [modern] time\". He was named the greatest character \"of the last 20 years\" in 2010 by ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', was ranked the second-greatest cartoon character by ''[[TV Guide]]'', behind [[Bugs Bunny]], and was voted the greatest television character of all time by [[Channel 4]] viewers. For voicing Homer, Castellaneta has won four [[Primetime Emmy Awards]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance|Outstanding Voice-Over Performance]] and a special-achievement [[Annie Award]]. In 2000, Homer and his family were awarded a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].\n\n==Role in ''The Simpsons''==\nHomer Jay Simpson is the bumbling husband of Marge and father of Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson.{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=78\u201379}} He is the son of [[Mona Simpson (The Simpsons)|Mona]] and [[Grampa Simpson|Abraham \"Grampa\" Simpson]].

Xianying Palace is a temple that was built during the Northern Song Dynasty, starting in 1122. It was originally a [[Taoist]] temple to the sea goddess [[Matsu (goddess)|Matsu]], but became [[Buddhist]] later. At the present time the local government has restored the temple to its [[Ming Dynasty]] appearance, although many additions had been made during the [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]].\n\n{{citation needed span|Changdao Island was previously closed to non-Chinese nationals. Westerners found on the island were swiftly taken to the passenger ferry terminal and placed on the next ferry back to Penglai by the islands Police service. Islanders promptly reported all \"''outsiders''\" to the islands police service. Police explained the reasons for this was due to the high number of military installations on the Island.

[[Tourism]] is also important; many of the villages sport resort hotels.\n\n==Transportation==\nThe islands are regularly served by both a passenger and vehicle [[RORO|Roll On, Roll Off]] ferry from Penglai.  There is a small military airport on the largest island, Changdao Island.\n\n==Tourism==\nBoth Changdao National Forest Park and Changdao National Nature Reserve are located on the islands, which are on a cross-Bohai Sea flyway.\n\nTemple Island ({{zh|labels=no |t={{linktext|\u5edf\u5cf6}} |s={{linktext|\u5e99\u5c9b}} |p=Mi\u00e0od\u01ceo}}) got its name from the large number of temples that were built there. Xianying Palace is a temple that was built during the Northern Song Dynasty, starting in 1122. It was originally a [[Taoist]] temple to the sea goddess [[Matsu (goddess)|Matsu]], but became [[Buddhist]] later. At the present time the local government has restored the temple to its [[Ming Dynasty]] appearance, although many additions had been made during the [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]].\n\n{{citation needed span|Changdao Island was previously closed to non-Chinese nationals. Westerners found on the island were swiftly taken to the passenger ferry terminal and placed on the next ferry back to Penglai by the islands Police service. Islanders promptly reported all \"''outsiders''\" to the islands police service. Police explained the reasons for this was due to the high number of military installations on the Island. The Changdao Islands are now open to non-Chinese nationals, including westerners.

The system image also includes closed-source Android components, as well as some commercial third-party applications.\n\n==Philosophy==\nThe GeeksPhone One is the first handset produced by GeeksPhone. The company claims it to be the first Android-powered handset which allows the user to modify operating system components without having to [[rooting (Android OS)|root]] the device first. New OS images can easily be installed on the device; the company operates a [[wiki]] and a forum for users to share knowledge. However, unlike similar efforts such as [[Openmoko]], GeeksPhone does not publish details on the phone's hardware beyond common technical specifications.\n\nAnother difference to Openmoko is that GeeksPhone aims to provide a stable device suitable for everyday use and capable of competing with other commercial devices on the market. The GeeksPhone One ships with an Android version which has undergone quality tests and passed Android Open Source Project (AOSP) Code Compliance certification, allowing it to include closed-source Android components and participate in Android Market.\n\nAs of July 2010, the GeeksPhone is not available through any of the big mobile operators. While GeeksPhone does not rule out cooperation with operators, CEO Javier Ag\u00fcera has stated that the \u201cfreedom-based\u201d business model would have priority over any such agreement.<ref name=ag01 />\n\n==Certified Community Release program==\nIn July 2010, GeeksPhone announced their Certified Community Release (CCR) program. CCRs are Android ports developed by the community and subsequently certified by GeeksPhone. Releases may be certified as \u201cstable\u201d or \u201cbeta\u201d.

The system image also includes closed-source Android components, as well as some commercial third-party applications.\n\n==Philosophy==\nThe GeeksPhone One is the first handset produced by GeeksPhone. The company claims it to be the first Android-powered handset which allows the user to modify operating system components without having to [[rooting (Android OS)|root]] the device first. New OS images can easily be installed on the device; the company operates a [[wiki]] and a forum for users to share knowledge. However, unlike similar efforts such as [[Openmoko]], GeeksPhone does not publish details on the phone's hardware beyond common technical specifications.\n\nAnother difference to Openmoko is that GeeksPhone aims to provide a stable device suitable for everyday use and capable of competing with other commercial devices on the market. The GeeksPhone One ships with an Android version which has undergone quality tests and passed Android Open Source Project (AOSP) Code Compliance certification, allowing it to include closed-source Android components and participate in Android Market.\n\nAs of July 2010, the GeeksPhone is not available through any of the big mobile operators. While GeeksPhone does not rule out cooperation with operators, CEO Javier Ag\u00fcera has stated that the \u201cfreedom-based\u201d business model would have priority over any such agreement.<ref name=ag01 />\n\n==Certified Community Release program==\nIn July 2010, GeeksPhone announced their Certified Community Release (CCR) program. CCRs are Android ports developed by the community and subsequently certified by GeeksPhone. Releases may be certified as \u201cstable\u201d or \u201cbeta\u201d. While full credit is given to the developer, GeeksPhone will give technical support to users of these builds and flash phones with a CCR if requested by the customer. Use of a CCR will not void the warranty of the phone.\n\nDevelopers can get technical support from GeeksPhone and major contributors may receive an additional free handset for development from GeeksPhone and, in some cases, sponsorships.<ref name=ag01>{{cite web |url=http://www.androidguys.com/2010/07/21/geeksphones-ccr-program-real-open-source-phone/ | title=Geeks'Phone's CCR Program: a Real Open-Source Phone |publisher=Android Guys |accessdate=18 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nGeeksPhone initially announced that phones would not yet ship with CCRs preinstalled; however, as of at least October 2010, phones have been shipped with a CCR based on Android 2.2 (Froyo).\n\n==Market availability and clones==\nGeeksPhone sells the One in Europe and Latin America.
