Takshashila was well connected by roads with other parts of the Mauryan Empire. The Mauryas had maintained this very ancient highway from Takshashila to [[Patliputra]] (present-day [[Patna]] in India). Chandragupta Maurya had a whole army of officials overseeing the maintenance of this road as told by the Greek diplomat [[Megasthenes]] who spent fifteen years at the Mauryan court. Constructed in eight stages, this road is said to have connected the cities of [[Peshawar|Purushapura]], [[Taxila|Takshashila]], [[Hastinapur]]a, [[Kannauj|Kanyakubja]], [[Allahabad|Prayag]], [[Patliputra]] and [[Tamralipta]], a distance of around {{convert|2600|km}}.<ref name=\"KMSarkar1927\"/> \n\nThe route of Chandragupta was built over the ancient \"[[Uttarapatha]]\" or the Northern Road, which had been mentioned by [[P\u0101\u1e47ini]]. The emperor [[Ashoka]] had it recorded in his edict about having trees planted, wells built at every half [[Kos (unit)|kos]] and many \"nimisdhayas\", which is often translated as rest-houses along the route. The emperor [[Kanishka]] is also known to have controlled the Uttarapatha.<ref name=\"Vadime\"/>\n\n=== Sur and Mughal Empires ===\n[[Sher Shah Suri]], the medieval ruler of the [[Sur Empire]], took to rebuilding Chandragupta's Royal Road in the 16th century. The old route was further rerouted at [[Sonargaon]] and [[Rohtas district|Rohtas]] and its breadth increased. [[Fruit trees]] and [[shade trees]] were planted. At every 2 kos, a [[Caravanserai|sarai]] was built, the number of [[Kos Minar|kos minars]] and [[Stepwell|baolis]] increased. Gardens were also built alongside some sections of the highway. Those who stopped at the sarai were provided food for free. His son [[Islam Shah Suri]] constructed an additional sarai in-between every sarai originally built by Sher Shah on the road toward Bengal. More sarais were built under the [[Mughals]]. [[Jahangir]] under his reign issued a decree that all sarais be built of burnt brick and stone. [[Broad-leaved tree]]s were planted in the stretch between Lahore and Agra and he built bridges overall water bodies that were situated on the path of the highways.<ref name=\"Vadime\"/><ref name=\"Romila\"/> The route was referred to as \"Sadak-e-Azam\" by Suri, and \"Badshahi Sadak\" during Mughals.<ref>Anu Kapur, p. 84, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ApCKDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT84&dq=sadak+e+azam+sher+shah&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjOw-6Vr8PiAhXZfSsKHS8CBIgQ6AEILTAB#v=onepage&q=sadak%20e%20azam%20sher%20shah&f=false Mapping Place Names of India]</ref>\n\n=== British Empire ===\n[[File:GTRoad Ambala.jpg|thumb|A scene from the [[Ambala]] cantonment during the [[British India]].]]\nIn the 1830s the East India Company started a program of metalled road construction, for both commercial and administrative purposes.

Volume II M-Z]</ref> During the time of the [[Mauryan Empire]] in the 3rd century BCE, overland trade between India and several parts of [[Western Asia]] and [[Bactria]] world went through the cities of the north-west, primarily [[Taxila (ancient)|Takshashila]] and [[Purushapura]] modern-day [[Peshawar]] (in present-day in [[Pakistan]]). Takshashila was well connected by roads with other parts of the Mauryan Empire. The Mauryas had maintained this very ancient highway from Takshashila to [[Patliputra]] (present-day [[Patna]] in India). Chandragupta Maurya had a whole army of officials overseeing the maintenance of this road as told by the Greek diplomat [[Megasthenes]] who spent fifteen years at the Mauryan court. Constructed in eight stages, this road is said to have connected the cities of [[Peshawar|Purushapura]], [[Taxila|Takshashila]], [[Hastinapur]]a, [[Kannauj|Kanyakubja]], [[Allahabad|Prayag]], [[Patliputra]] and [[Tamralipta]], a distance of around {{convert|2600|km}}.<ref name=\"KMSarkar1927\"/> \n\nThe route of Chandragupta was built over the ancient \"[[Uttarapatha]]\" or the Northern Road, which had been mentioned by [[P\u0101\u1e47ini]]. The emperor [[Ashoka]] had it recorded in his edict about having trees planted, wells built at every half [[Kos (unit)|kos]] and many \"nimisdhayas\", which is often translated as rest-houses along the route. The emperor [[Kanishka]] is also known to have controlled the Uttarapatha.<ref name=\"Vadime\"/>\n\n=== Sur and Mughal Empires ===\n[[Sher Shah Suri]], the medieval ruler of the [[Sur Empire]], took to rebuilding Chandragupta's Royal Road in the 16th century. The old route was further rerouted at [[Sonargaon]] and [[Rohtas district|Rohtas]] and its breadth increased. [[Fruit trees]] and [[shade trees]] were planted. At every 2 kos, a [[Caravanserai|sarai]] was built, the number of [[Kos Minar|kos minars]] and [[Stepwell|baolis]] increased. Gardens were also built alongside some sections of the highway. Those who stopped at the sarai were provided food for free. His son [[Islam Shah Suri]] constructed an additional sarai in-between every sarai originally built by Sher Shah on the road toward Bengal. More sarais were built under the [[Mughals]]. [[Jahangir]] under his reign issued a decree that all sarais be built of burnt brick and stone. [[Broad-leaved tree]]s were planted in the stretch between Lahore and Agra and he built bridges overall water bodies that were situated on the path of the highways.<ref name=\"Vadime\"/><ref name=\"Romila\"/> The route was referred to as \"Sadak-e-Azam\" by Suri, and \"Badshahi Sadak\" during Mughals.<ref>Anu Kapur, p. 84, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ApCKDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT84&dq=sadak+e+azam+sher+shah&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjOw-6Vr8PiAhXZfSsKHS8CBIgQ6AEILTAB#v=onepage&q=sadak%20e%20azam%20sher%20shah&f=false Mapping Place Names of India]</ref>\n\n=== British Empire ===\n[[File:GTRoad Ambala.jpg|thumb|A scene from the [[Ambala]] cantonment during the [[British India]].]]\nIn the 1830s the East India Company started a programme of metalled road construction, for both commercial and administrative purposes.

Coppola, along with editor/longtime collaborator [[Walter Murch]], added 49 minutes of material that had been removed from the original film. It represents a significant re-edit of the original version.\n\n==Production==\n[[Francis Ford Coppola]] began production on the new cut with working-partner Kim Aubry. Coppola then tried to get Murch, who was reluctant at first. He thought it would be extremely difficult recutting a film that had taken two years to edit originally. He later changed his mind (after working on the reconstruction of [[Orson Welles]]' ''[[Touch of Evil]]''). Coppola and Murch then examined several of the rough prints and dailies for the film. It was decided early on that the editing of the film would be like editing a new film altogether. One such example was the new French plantation sequence. The scenes were greatly edited to fit into the movie originally, only to be cut out in the end. When working again on the film, instead of using the heavily edited version, Murch decided to work the scene all over again, editing it as if for the first time.\n\nMuch work needed to be done to the new scenes. Due to the off-screen noises during the shoot, most of the dialogue was impossible to hear. During post-production of the film the actors were brought back to re-record their lines (known as [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|A.D.R.]] or dubbing). This was done for the scenes that made it into the original cut, but not for the deleted scenes. For the ''Redux'' version, [[Martin Sheen]], [[Robert Duvall]], [[Sam Bottoms]], [[Albert Hall (actor)|Albert Hall]], [[Frederic Forrest]], and [[Aurore Cl\u00e9ment]] were brought back to record ADR for the new scenes.\n\n===Music===\nNew music was composed and recorded for the remade film by [[San Francisco Bay Area]]-based composer Ed Goldfarb.<ref>Ken Hughes, \"Ed Goldfarb: Synthesizing the Apocalypse\" (2001), ''Keyboard'', Vol. 27, No. 9, pp. 54-56, 58. Available at https://openmusiclibrary.org/article/959386. Article reprinted at https://edgoldfarbmusic.com/portfolio/apocalypse-now-redux.</ref> For example, it was thought no music had been composed for Willard and Roxanne's romantic interlude in the French Plantation scene. To make matters worse, composer [[Carmine Coppola]] had died in 1991. However, the old recording and musical scores were checked and a track titled \"Love Theme\" was found. During scoring, Francis Coppola had told Carmine, his father, to write a theme for the scene before it was ultimately deleted. For the remake, the track was recorded by a group of [[synthesist]]s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\n===Cinematography===\n[[Vittorio Storaro]] also returned from Italy to head the development of a new color balance of the film and new scenes. When ''Redux'' was being released, Storaro learned that a [[Technicolor]] [[dye-transfer process]] was being brought back. The dye-transfer is a three-strip process that makes the color highly saturated and has consistent black tone. Storaro wished to use this on ''Redux'', but in order to do it, he needed to cut the original negative of ''Apocalypse Now'', leaving ''Apocalypse Now Redux'' the only version available. Storaro decided to do it, when convinced by Coppola that this version would be the one that would be remembered.\n\n==New scenes and alterations==\nThe film contains several alterations, and two entirely new scenes. One of the new scenes has the boat meeting the Playmates once again, further up the river; the other has them meet a family of holdout [[French people|French]] colonists on their remote rubber plantation. There are also a few additional scenes with Colonel Kurtz.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A54023-2001Aug9.html |title='Apocalypse': Once More, With Extra Footage |publisher=washingtonpost.com |date=2001-08-10 |accessdate=2017-06-30}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n{{About|| a list of the rest of the cast that appeared in the original cut|Apocalypse Now#Cast}}\n* [[Christian Marquand]] as Hubert de Marais\n* [[Aurore Cl\u00e9ment]] as Roxanne Sarrault\n* [[Roman Coppola]] as Francis de Marais\n* [[Gian-Carlo Coppola]] as Gilles de Marais\n* Michel Pitton as Philippe de Marais\n* Franck Villard as Gaston de Marais\n* David Olivier as Christian de Marais\n* Chrystel Le Pelletier as Claudine\n* Robert Julian as The Tutor\n* Yvon Le Saux as Sgt.

Coppola went to the festival, accompanied by Murch, Storaro, production designer Dean Tavoularis, producer Kim Aubry and actors Bottoms and Cl\u00e9ment.\n\n===Box office===\nThe film was given a [[limited release]] in the U.S. on August 3, 2001, and was also released theatrically around the world in some countries, grossing {{US$|4.6 million|long=no}} in the United States and Canada, and {{US$|7.9 million|long=no}} in other territories, for a worldwide total of {{US$|12.5 million|long =no}}.<ref name=\"BOM\" />\n\n===Critical response===\nOn [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds a 93% approval rating based on 82 reviews, with an average rating of 7.78/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"The additional footage slows down the movie somewhat (some say the new cut is inferior to the original), but ''Apocalypse Now Redux'' is still a great piece of cinema.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/apocalypse_now_redux_2001|title=Apocalypse Now Redux (2001)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango]]|accessdate=August 4, 2019}}</ref> [[Metacritic]], which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 92 out of 100 based on 39 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/apocalypse-now-redux|title=Apocalypse Now Redux (2001)|website=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=August 4, 2019}}</ref> Some critics thought highly of the additions, such as [[A. O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'', who wrote that it \"grows richer and stranger with each viewing, and the restoration of scenes left in the cutting room two decades ago has only added to its sublimity.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9404E6D9143CF930A3575BC0A9679C8B63&scp=11&sq=apocalypse%20now&st=cse|title= Aching Heart of Darkness|date=2001-08-03|work=New York Times|accessdate=2009-07-20 | first=A. O. | last=Scott}}</ref>\n\nSome critics, however, thought the new scenes slowed the pacing, were too lengthy (notably the French plantation sequence), and added nothing overall to the film's impact. [[Owen Gleiberman]] wrote \"''Apocalypse Now Redux'' is the meandering, indulgent art project that [Francis Ford Coppola] was still enough of a craftsman, in 1979, to avoid.\"<ref>{{cite web|title = Apocalypse Now Redux {{!}} EW.com|url = http://www.ew.com/article/2001/08/01/apocalypse-now-redux|website = www.ew.com|access-date = 2016-01-17}}</ref> Despite this, other critics still gave it high ratings.

Coppola, along with editor/longtime collaborator [[Walter Murch]], added 49 minutes of material that had been removed from the original film. It represents a significant re-edit of the original version.\n\n==Production==\n[[Francis Ford Coppola]] began production on the new cut with working-partner Kim Aubry. Coppola then tried to get Murch, who was reluctant at first. He thought it would be extremely difficult recutting a film that had taken two years to edit originally. He later changed his mind (after working on the reconstruction of [[Orson Welles]]' ''[[Touch of Evil]]''). Coppola and Murch then examined several of the rough prints and dailies for the film. It was decided early on that the editing of the film would be like editing a new film altogether. One such example was the new French plantation sequence. The scenes were greatly edited to fit into the movie originally, only to be cut out in the end. When working again on the film, instead of using the heavily edited version, Murch decided to work the scene all over again, editing it as if for the first time.\n\nMuch work needed to be done to the new scenes. Due to the off-screen noises during the shoot, most of the dialogue was impossible to hear. During post-production of the film the actors were brought back to re-record their lines (known as [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|A.D.R.]] or dubbing). This was done for the scenes that made it into the original cut, but not for the deleted scenes. For the ''Redux'' version, [[Martin Sheen]], [[Robert Duvall]], [[Sam Bottoms]], [[Albert Hall (actor)|Albert Hall]], [[Frederic Forrest]], and [[Aurore Cl\u00e9ment]] were brought back to record ADR for the new scenes.\n\n===Music===\nNew music was composed and recorded for the remade film by [[San Francisco Bay Area]]-based composer Ed Goldfarb.<ref>Ken Hughes, \"Ed Goldfarb: Synthesizing the Apocalypse\" (2001), ''Keyboard'', Vol. 27, No. 9, pp. 54-56, 58. Available at https://openmusiclibrary.org/article/959386. Article reprinted at https://edgoldfarbmusic.com/portfolio/apocalypse-now-redux.</ref> For example, it was thought no music had been composed for Willard and Roxanne's romantic interlude in the French Plantation scene. To make matters worse, composer [[Carmine Coppola]] had died in 1991. However, the old recording and musical scores were checked and a track titled \"Love Theme\" was found. During scoring, Francis Coppola had told Carmine, his father, to write a theme for the scene before it was ultimately deleted. For the remake, the track was recorded by a group of [[synthesist]]s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\n===Cinematography===\n[[Vittorio Storaro]] also returned from Italy to head the development of a new color balance of the film and new scenes. When ''Redux'' was being released, Storaro learned that a [[Technicolor]] [[dye-transfer process]] was being brought back. The dye-transfer is a three-strip process that makes the color highly saturated and has consistent black tone. Storaro wished to use this on ''Redux'', but in order to do it, he needed to cut the original negative of ''Apocalypse Now'', leaving ''Apocalypse Now Redux'' the only version available. Storaro decided to do it, when convinced by Coppola that this version would be the one that would be remembered.\n\n==New scenes and alterations==\nThe film contains several alterations, and two entirely new scenes. One of the new scenes has the boat meeting the Playmates once again, further up the river; the other has them meet a family of holdout [[French people|French]] colonists on their remote rubber plantation. There are also a few additional scenes with Colonel Kurtz.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A54023-2001Aug9.html |title='Apocalypse': Once More, With Extra Footage |publisher=washingtonpost.com |date=2001-08-10 |accessdate=2017-06-30}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n{{About|| a list of the rest of the cast that appeared in the original cut|Apocalypse Now#Cast}}\n* [[Christian Marquand]] as Hubert de Marais\n* [[Aurore Cl\u00e9ment]] as Roxanne Sarrault\n* [[Roman Coppola]] as Francis de Marais\n* [[Gian-Carlo Coppola]] as Gilles de Marais\n* Michel Pitton as Philippe de Marais\n* Franck Villard as Gaston de Marais\n* David Olivier as Christian de Marais\n* Chrystel Le Pelletier as Claudine\n* Robert Julian as The Tutor\n* Yvon Le Saux as Sgt.

Coppola went to the festival, accompanied by Murch, Storaro, production designer Dean Tavoularis, producer Kim Aubry and actors Bottoms and Cl\u00e9ment.\n\n===Box office===\nThe film was given a [[limited release]] in the U.S. on August 3, 2001, and was also released theatrically around the world in some countries, grossing {{US$|4.6 million|long=no}} in the United States and Canada, and {{US$|7.9 million|long=no}} in other territories, for a worldwide total of {{US$|12.5 million|long =no}}.<ref name=\"BOM\" />\n\n===Critical response===\nOn [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds a 93% approval rating based on 82 reviews, with an average rating of 7.78/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"The additional footage slows down the movie somewhat (some say the new cut is inferior to the original), but ''Apocalypse Now Redux'' is still a great piece of cinema.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/apocalypse_now_redux_2001|title=Apocalypse Now Redux (2001)|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango]]|accessdate=August 4, 2019}}</ref> [[Metacritic]], which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 92 out of 100 based on 39 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/apocalypse-now-redux|title=Apocalypse Now Redux (2001)|website=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=August 4, 2019}}</ref> Some critics thought highly of the additions, such as [[A.

[[Owen Gleiberman]] wrote \"''Apocalypse Now Redux'' is the meandering, indulgent art project that [Francis Ford Coppola] was still enough of a craftsman, in 1979, to avoid.\"<ref>{{cite web|title = Apocalypse Now Redux {{!}} EW.com|url = http://www.ew.com/article/2001/08/01/apocalypse-now-redux|website = www.ew.com|access-date = 2016-01-17}}</ref> Despite this, other critics still gave it high ratings.

He was a major [[Calvinist]] opponent of [[John Wesley]].  He is best remembered as the author of the hymn [[Rock of Ages (Christian hymn)|\"Rock of Ages\"]].  Three of his other hymns \u2013 \"A Debtor to Mercy Alone\", \"Deathless Principle, Arise\" and \"Object of My First Desire\" \u2013 are still occasionally sung today.\n\n==Background and early life, 1740\u201355==\nAugustus Toplady was born in [[Farnham]], Surrey, England in November 1740. His father, Richard Toplady, was probably from [[Enniscorthy]], [[County Wexford]] in Ireland.  Richard Toplady became a [[commissioned officer]] in the [[Royal Marines]] in 1739; by the time of his death, he had reached the rank of major.  In May 1741, shortly after Augustus' birth, Richard participated in the [[Battle of Cartagena de Indias]] (1741), the most significant battle of the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] (1739\u201342), during the course of which he died, most likely of [[yellow fever]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Sheltering in the Rock |publisher=Banner of Truth |url=http://www.banneroftruth.org/pages/articles/article_detail.php?1107 |accessdate=28 July 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822223800/http://www.banneroftruth.org/pages/articles/article_detail.php?1107 |archivedate=22 August 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> leaving Augustus' mother to raise the boy alone.\n\nToplady's mother, Catherine, was the daughter of Richard Bate, who was the [[Incumbent (ecclesiastical)|incumbent]] of [[Chilham]] from 1711 until his death in 1736.  Catherine and her son moved from Farnham to [[Westminster]]. He attended [[Westminster School]] from 1750 to 1755.\n\n==Trinity College, Dublin: 1755\u201360==\nIn 1755, Catherine and Augustus moved to Ireland, and Augustus was enrolled in [[Trinity College, Dublin]].\n\nShortly thereafter, in August 1755, the 15-year-old Toplady attended a sermon preached by James Morris, a follower of [[John Wesley]], in a barn in Codymain, co. Wexford (though in his ''Dying Avowal'', Toplady denies that the preacher was directly connected to Wesley, with whom he had developed a bitter relationship). He would remember this sermon as the time at which he received his [[effectual calling]] from God.\n\nHaving undergone his religious conversion under the preaching of a [[Methodist]], Toplady initially followed Wesley in supporting [[Arminianism]]. In 1758, however, the 18-year-old Toplady read [[Thomas Manton]]'s seventeenth-century sermon on [[Gospel of John|John]]&nbsp;17 and [[Girolamo Zanchi|Jerome Zanchius]]'s ''Confession of the Christian Religion'' (1562). These works convinced Toplady that [[Calvinism]], not Arminianism, was correct.\n\nIn 1759, Toplady published his first book, ''Poems on Sacred Subjects''.\n\nFollowing his graduation from Trinity College in 1760, Toplady and his mother returned to Westminster. There, Toplady met and was influenced by several prominent Calvinist ministers, including [[George Whitefield]], [[John Gill (theologian)|John Gill]], and [[William Romaine]]. It was John Gill who in 1760 urged Toplady to publish his translation of Zanchius's work on predestination, Toplady commenting that \"I was not then, however, sufficiently delivered from the fear of man.\"<ref>{{Citation | volume = 1 | last = Toplady | title = Works | page = 189}}, at {{Citation | page = 34 | first = T | last = Wrights | year = 1911 | type = biography | title = Toplady}}.</ref>\n\n==Church ministry: 1762\u201378==\nIn 1762, [[Edward Willes (priest)|Edward Willes]], the [[Bishop of Bath and Wells]], ordained Toplady as an Anglican [[Anglican ministry#Deacons|deacon]], appointing him [[curate]] of [[Blagdon]], located in the [[Mendip Hills]] of [[Somerset]].\n\nToplady wrote his famous hymn ''Rock of Ages'' in 1763.  A local tradition \u2013 discounted by most historians \u2013 holds that he wrote the hymn after seeking shelter under a large rock at [[Burrington Combe]], a magnificent ravine close to Blagdon, during a [[thunderstorm]].\n\nUpon being ordained [[Anglican ministry#Priests|priest]] in 1764, Toplady returned to London briefly, and then served as curate of [[Farleigh Hungerford]] for a little over a year (1764\u201365). He then returned to stay with friends in London for 1765\u201366.\n\nIn May 1766, he became incumbent of [[Harpford]] and [[Venn Ottery]], two villages in [[Devon]].  In 1768, however, he learned that he had been named to this incumbency because it had been purchased for him; seeing this as [[simony]], he chose to exchange the incumbency for the post of [[Vicar#Anglican|vicar]] of [[Broadhembury]], another Devon village.  He would serve as vicar of Broadhembury until his death, although he received leave to be absent from Broadhembury from 1775 on.\n\nToplady never married, though he did have relationships with two women.  The first was [[Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon]], the founder of the [[Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion]], a Calvinist Methodist series of congregations.  Toplady first met Huntingdon in 1763, and preached in her chapels several times in 1775 during his absence from Broadhembury.  The second was [[Catharine Macaulay]], whom he first met in 1773, and with whom he spent a large amount of time in the years 1773\u201377.\n\n===Animals and Natural World===\nToplady was a prolific essayist and letter correspondent and wrote on a wide range of topics. He was interested in the natural world and in animals. He composed a short work ''Sketch of Natural History, with a few particulars on Birds, Meteors, Sagacity of Brutes, and the solar system'', wherein he set down his observations about the marvels of nature, including the behaviour of birds, and illustrations of wise actions on the part of various animals. Toplady also considered the problem of evil as it relates to the sufferings of animals in ''A Short Essay on Original Sin'', and in a public debate delivered a speech on ''Whether unnecessary cruelty to the brute creation is not criminal?''. In this speech he repudiated brutality towards animals and also affirmed his belief that the Scriptures point to the resurrection of animals.<ref>{{Citation | first = Augustus | last = Toplady | title = The Works | place = London | publisher = J Chidley | year = 1837 | origyear = 1794 | pages = 409\u201316, 443\u201346, 518\u201339}}.</ref> Toplady's position about animal brutality and the resurrection were echoed by his contemporaries [[Joseph Butler]], [[Richard Dean (curate)|Richard Dean]], [[Humphry Primatt]] and [[John Wesley]], and throughout the nineteenth century other Christian writers such as Joseph Hamilton, [[G. H. Pember|George Hawkins Pember]], [[George N. H. Peters]], Joseph Seiss, and James Macauley developed the arguments in more detail in the context of the debates about [[animal welfare]], [[animal rights]] and [[vivisection]].<ref>{{Citation | first = Keith | last = Thomas | title = Man and the Natural World: Changing Attitudes in England 1500\u20131800 | place = London | publisher = Penguin | year = 1984 | ISBN = 978-0-14-014686-8}}.</ref><ref>{{Citation | editor1-first = Andrew | editor1-last = Linzey | editor2-first = Tom | editor2-last = Regan | title = Animals and Christianity: A Book of Readings | place = London | publisher = SPCK | year = 1989 | ISBN = 0-281-04373-6}}.</ref><ref>{{Citation | first = Rod | last = Preece | title = Darwinism, Christianity and the Great Vivisection Debate | journal = Journal of the History of Ideas | volume = 63 | year = 2003 | pages = 399\u2013419}}.</ref>\n\n===Calvinist controversialist: 1769\u201378===\nToplady's first salvo into the world of religious controversy came in 1769 when he wrote a book in response to a situation at the [[University of Oxford]].  Six students had been expelled from [[St Edmund Hall, Oxford|St Edmund Hall]] because of their Calvinist views, which [[Thomas Nowell]] criticised as inconsistent with the views of the Church of England. Toplady then criticised Nowell's position in his book ''The Church of England Vindicated from the Charge of Arminianism'', which argued that Calvinism, not Arminianism, was the position historically held by the Church of England.\n\n1769 also saw Toplady publish his translation of [[Zanchius]]'s ''Confession of the Christian Religion'' (1562), one of the works which had convinced Toplady to become a Calvinist in 1758.  Toplady entitled his translation ''The Doctrine of Absolute Predestination Stated and Asserted''.<ref>{{Citation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=uJEPAAAAIAAJPPA8,M1 | title = The Doctrine of Absolute Predestination Stated and Asserted | first = Girolamo | last = Zanchi}}, translated by Toplady, with a letter to John Wesley appended.</ref> This work drew a vehement response from John Wesley, thus initiating a protracted pamphlet debate between Toplady and Wesley about whether the Church of England was historically Calvinist or Arminian.  This debate peaked in 1774, when Toplady published his 700-page ''The Historic Proof of the Doctrinal Calvinism of the Church of England'', a massive study which traced the doctrine of [[Predestination (Calvinism)|predestination]] from the period of the [[Early Church]] through to [[William Laud]]. The section about the [[Synod of Dort]] contained a footnote identifying five basic propositions of the Calvinist faith, arguably the first appearance in print of the summary of Calvinism known as the \"[[five points of Calvinism]]\".\n\nThe relationship between Toplady and Wesley that had initially been cordial, involving exchanges of letters in Toplady's Arminian days, became increasingly bitter and reached its nadir with the \"Zanchy affair\".<ref>{{Citation | chapter = 8 | first = George | last = Ella | year = 2000 | type = biography | title = A Debtor to Mercy Alone}}.</ref> Wesley took exception to the publication of Toplady's translation of Zanchius's work on predestination in 1769 and published, in turn, an abridgment of that work titled \"The Doctrine of Absolute Predestination Stated and Asserted\", adding his own comment that \"The sum of all is this: One in twenty (suppose) of mankind are elected; nineteen in twenty are reprobated. The elect shall be saved, do what they will; the reprobate will be damned, do what they can. Reader believe this, or be damned. Witness my hand.\" Toplady viewed the abridgment and comments as a distortion of his and Zanchius's views and was particularly enraged that the authorship of these additions were attributed to him, as though he approved of the content.\n\nToplady published a response in the form of \"A Letter to the Rev Mr John Wesley; Relative to His Pretended Abridgement of Zanchius on Predestination\".<ref>[http://homepage.mac.com/shanerosenthal/reformationink/attoptowes.htm \"A Letter to the Rev Mr John Wesley; Relative to His Pretended Abridgement of Zanchius on Predestination\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206024136/http://homepage.mac.com/shanerosenthal/reformationink/attoptowes.htm |date=6 December 2007 }} (26 March 1770).</ref>  Wesley never publicly accepted any wrongdoing on his part and seemingly denied his authorship of the comments contained in his abridgement when, in his 1771 work \"The Consequenses Proved\" that responded to Toplady's letter, he ascribed his additions to Toplady.{{Efn | The abridgement was not included in Wesley's \"Collected Works\" until 1872.}}  Subsequently, Wesley avoided direct correspondence with Toplady, famously stating in a letter of 24 June 1770 that \"I do not fight with chimney-sweepers.

He was a major [[Calvinist]] opponent of [[John Wesley]].  He is best remembered as the author of the hymn [[Rock of Ages (Christian hymn)|\"Rock of Ages\"]].  Three of his other hymns \u2013 \"A Debtor to Mercy Alone\", \"Deathless Principle, Arise\" and \"Object of My First Desire\" \u2013 are still occasionally sung today.\n\n==Background and early life, 1740\u201355==\nAugustus Toplady was born in [[Farnham]], Surrey, England in November 1740. His father, Richard Toplady, was probably from [[Enniscorthy]], [[County Wexford]] in Ireland.  Richard Toplady became a [[commissioned officer]] in the [[Royal Marines]] in 1739; by the time of his death, he had reached the rank of major.  In May 1741, shortly after Augustus' birth, Richard participated in the [[Battle of Cartagena de Indias]] (1741), the most significant battle of the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] (1739\u201342), during the course of which he died, most likely of [[yellow fever]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Sheltering in the Rock |publisher=Banner of Truth |url=http://www.banneroftruth.org/pages/articles/article_detail.php?1107 |accessdate=28 July 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822223800/http://www.banneroftruth.org/pages/articles/article_detail.php?1107 |archivedate=22 August 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> leaving Augustus' mother to raise the boy alone.\n\nToplady's mother, Catherine, was the daughter of Richard Bate, who was the [[Incumbent (ecclesiastical)|incumbent]] of [[Chilham]] from 1711 until his death in 1736.  Catherine and her son moved from Farnham to [[Westminster]]. He attended [[Westminster School]] from 1750 to 1755.\n\n==Trinity College, Dublin: 1755\u201360==\nIn 1755, Catherine and Augustus moved to Ireland, and Augustus was enrolled in [[Trinity College, Dublin]].\n\nShortly thereafter, in August 1755, the 15-year-old Toplady attended a sermon preached by James Morris, a follower of [[John Wesley]], in a barn in Codymain, co. Wexford (though in his ''Dying Avowal'', Toplady denies that the preacher was directly connected to Wesley, with whom he had developed a bitter relationship). He would remember this sermon as the time at which he received his [[effectual calling]] from God.\n\nHaving undergone his religious conversion under the preaching of a [[Methodist]], Toplady initially followed Wesley in supporting [[Arminianism]]. In 1758, however, the 18-year-old Toplady read [[Thomas Manton]]'s seventeenth-century sermon on [[Gospel of John|John]]&nbsp;17 and [[Girolamo Zanchi|Jerome Zanchius]]'s ''Confession of the Christian Religion'' (1562). These works convinced Toplady that [[Calvinism]], not Arminianism, was correct.\n\nIn 1759, Toplady published his first book, ''Poems on Sacred Subjects''.\n\nFollowing his graduation from Trinity College in 1760, Toplady and his mother returned to Westminster. There, Toplady met and was influenced by several prominent Calvinist ministers, including [[George Whitefield]], [[John Gill (theologian)|John Gill]], and [[William Romaine]]. It was John Gill who in 1760 urged Toplady to publish his translation of Zanchius's work on predestination, Toplady commenting that \"I was not then, however, sufficiently delivered from the fear of man.\"<ref>{{Citation | volume = 1 | last = Toplady | title = Works | page = 189}}, at {{Citation | page = 34 | first = T | last = Wrights | year = 1911 | type = biography | title = Toplady}}.</ref>\n\n==Church ministry: 1762\u201378==\nIn 1762, [[Edward Willes (priest)|Edward Willes]], the [[Bishop of Bath and Wells]], ordained Toplady as an Anglican [[Anglican ministry#Deacons|deacon]], appointing him [[curate]] of [[Blagdon]], located in the [[Mendip Hills]] of [[Somerset]].\n\nToplady wrote his famous hymn ''Rock of Ages'' in 1763.  A local tradition \u2013 discounted by most historians \u2013 holds that he wrote the hymn after seeking shelter under a large rock at [[Burrington Combe]], a magnificent ravine close to Blagdon, during a [[thunderstorm]].\n\nUpon being ordained [[Anglican ministry#Priests|priest]] in 1764, Toplady returned to London briefly, and then served as curate of [[Farleigh Hungerford]] for a little over a year (1764\u201365). He then returned to stay with friends in London for 1765\u201366.\n\nIn May 1766, he became incumbent of [[Harpford]] and [[Venn Ottery]], two villages in [[Devon]].  In 1768, however, he learned that he had been named to this incumbency because it had been purchased for him; seeing this as [[simony]], he chose to exchange the incumbency for the post of [[Vicar#Anglican|vicar]] of [[Broadhembury]], another Devon village.  He would serve as vicar of Broadhembury until his death, although he received leave to be absent from Broadhembury from 1775 on.\n\nToplady never married, though he did have relationships with two women.  The first was [[Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon]], the founder of the [[Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion]], a Calvinist Methodist series of congregations.  Toplady first met Huntingdon in 1763, and preached in her chapels several times in 1775 during his absence from Broadhembury.  The second was [[Catharine Macaulay]], whom he first met in 1773, and with whom he spent a large amount of time in the years 1773\u201377.\n\n===Animals and Natural World===\nToplady was a prolific essayist and letter correspondent and wrote on a wide range of topics. He was interested in the natural world and in animals. He composed a short work ''Sketch of Natural History, with a few particulars on Birds, Meteors, Sagacity of Brutes, and the solar system'', wherein he set down his observations about the marvels of nature, including the behaviour of birds, and illustrations of wise actions on the part of various animals. Toplady also considered the problem of evil as it relates to the sufferings of animals in \"A Short Essay on Original Sin\", and in a public debate delivered a speech on \"Whether unnecessary cruelty to the brute creation is not criminal?\". In this speech he repudiated brutality towards animals and also affirmed his belief that the Scriptures point to the resurrection of animals.<ref>{{Citation | first = Augustus | last = Toplady | title = The Works | place = London | publisher = J Chidley | year = 1837 | origyear = 1794 | pages = 409\u201316, 443\u201346, 518\u201339}}.</ref> Toplady's position about animal brutality and the resurrection were echoed by his contemporaries [[Joseph Butler]], [[Richard Dean (curate)|Richard Dean]], [[Humphry Primatt]] and [[John Wesley]], and throughout the nineteenth century other Christian writers such as Joseph Hamilton, [[G. H. Pember|George Hawkins Pember]], [[George N. H. Peters]], Joseph Seiss, and James Macauley developed the arguments in more detail in the context of the debates about [[animal welfare]], [[animal rights]] and [[vivisection]].<ref>{{Citation | first = Keith | last = Thomas | title = Man and the Natural World: Changing Attitudes in England 1500\u20131800 | place = London | publisher = Penguin | year = 1984 | ISBN = 978-0-14-014686-8}}.</ref><ref>{{Citation | editor1-first = Andrew | editor1-last = Linzey | editor2-first = Tom | editor2-last = Regan | title = Animals and Christianity: A Book of Readings | place = London | publisher = SPCK | year = 1989 | ISBN = 0-281-04373-6}}.</ref><ref>{{Citation | first = Rod | last = Preece | title = Darwinism, Christianity and the Great Vivisection Debate | journal = Journal of the History of Ideas | volume = 63 | year = 2003 | pages = 399\u2013419}}.</ref>\n\n===Calvinist controversialist: 1769\u201378===\nToplady's first salvo into the world of religious controversy came in 1769 when he wrote a book in response to a situation at the [[University of Oxford]].  Six students had been expelled from [[St Edmund Hall, Oxford|St Edmund Hall]] because of their Calvinist views, which [[Thomas Nowell]] criticised as inconsistent with the views of the Church of England. Toplady then criticised Nowell's position in his book ''The Church of England Vindicated from the Charge of Arminianism'', which argued that Calvinism, not Arminianism, was the position historically held by the Church of England.\n\n1769 also saw Toplady publish his translation of [[Zanchius]]'s ''Confession of the Christian Religion'' (1562), one of the works which had convinced Toplady to become a Calvinist in 1758.  Toplady entitled his translation ''The Doctrine of Absolute Predestination Stated and Asserted''.<ref>{{Citation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=uJEPAAAAIAAJPPA8,M1 | title = The Doctrine of Absolute Predestination Stated and Asserted | first = Girolamo | last = Zanchi}}, translated by Toplady, with a letter to John Wesley appended.</ref> This work drew a vehement response from John Wesley, thus initiating a protracted pamphlet debate between Toplady and Wesley about whether the Church of England was historically Calvinist or Arminian.  This debate peaked in 1774, when Toplady published his 700-page ''The Historic Proof of the Doctrinal Calvinism of the Church of England'', a massive study which traced the doctrine of [[Predestination (Calvinism)|predestination]] from the period of the [[Early Church]] through to [[William Laud]]. The section about the [[Synod of Dort]] contained a footnote identifying five basic propositions of the Calvinist faith, arguably the first appearance in print of the summary of Calvinism known as the \"[[five points of Calvinism]]\".\n\nThe relationship between Toplady and Wesley that had initially been cordial, involving exchanges of letters in Toplady's Arminian days, became increasingly bitter and reached its nadir with the \"Zanchy affair\".<ref>{{Citation | chapter = 8 | first = George | last = Ella | year = 2000 | type = biography | title = A Debtor to Mercy Alone}}.</ref> Wesley took exception to the publication of Toplady's translation of Zanchius's work on predestination in 1769 and published, in turn, an abridgment of that work titled \"The Doctrine of Absolute Predestination Stated and Asserted\", adding his own comment that \"The sum of all is this: One in twenty (suppose) of mankind are elected; nineteen in twenty are reprobated. The elect shall be saved, do what they will; the reprobate will be damned, do what they can. Reader believe this, or be damned. Witness my hand.\" Toplady viewed the abridgment and comments as a distortion of his and Zanchius's views and was particularly enraged that the authorship of these additions were attributed to him, as though he approved of the content.\n\nToplady published a response in the form of \"A Letter to the Rev Mr John Wesley; Relative to His Pretended Abridgement of Zanchius on Predestination\".<ref>[http://homepage.mac.com/shanerosenthal/reformationink/attoptowes.htm \"A Letter to the Rev Mr John Wesley; Relative to His Pretended Abridgement of Zanchius on Predestination\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206024136/http://homepage.mac.com/shanerosenthal/reformationink/attoptowes.htm |date=6 December 2007 }} (26 March 1770).</ref>  Wesley never publicly accepted any wrongdoing on his part and seemingly denied his authorship of the comments contained in his abridgement when, in his 1771 work \"The Consequenses Proved\" that responded to Toplady's letter, he ascribed his additions to Toplady.{{Efn | The abridgement was not included in Wesley's \"Collected Works\" until 1872.}}  Subsequently, Wesley avoided direct correspondence with Toplady, famously stating in a letter of 24 June 1770 that \"I do not fight with chimney-sweepers.  He is too dirty a writer for me to meddle with. I should only foul my fingers. I read his title-page, and troubled myself no farther. I leave him to Mr Sellon.

The position of Ni\u0161 is strategically important, at the intersection of European highway and railway networks connecting Europe with Asia. Ni\u0161 is easily accessible, having an airport \u2013 [[Ni\u0161 Constantine the Great Airport]] and being a point of intersection of numerous railroad and highway lines. \n{{wide image|Ni\u0161, panorama n\u00e1m\u011bst\u00ed.jpg|700px|Panorama picture of the Square of the [[Milan I of Serbia|King Milan I]].}}\nIt is in Ni\u0161 that the trunk road running from the north down the [[Morava River (Central Europe)|Morava River]] valley forks into two major lines:\n\n* the south one, leading to [[Thessalonica]] and [[Athens]], along the [[Vardar]] River valley,\n* and the east one, running along the [[Nisava]] and the [[Maritsa|Marica]], leading towards Sofia and Istanbul, and further on, towards the Near East.\n\nThese roads have been widely known from ancient times, because they represented the beaten tracks along which peoples, goods and armies moved. Known as 'Via Militaris' in [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Byzantine]] periods, or 'Constantinople road' in Middle Ages, these roads still represent major European traffic arteries. Ni\u0161 thus stands at a point of intersection of the roads connecting Asia Minor to Europe, and the [[Black Sea]] to the Mediterranean. Nis had been a relatively developed city in the former Yugoslavia. In 1981, its GDP per capita was 110% of the Yugoslav average.<ref>{{cite book|title=Atlas svijeta: Novi pogled na Zemlju|year=1984|edition=3rd|publisher=Sveu\u010dili\u0161na naklada Liber|location=Zagreb|language=Croatian|editor1-first=Radovan|editor1-last=Radovinovi\u0107|editor2-first=Ivan|editor2-last=Berti\u0107}}</ref>\n\nAs of September 2017, Ni\u0161 has one of 14 [[free economic zone]]s established in Serbia.<ref name=\"srbeconomiczone2017\">{{cite news |last1=Mikavica |first1=A. |title=Slobodne zone mamac za investitore |url=http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/388105/Slobodne-zone-mamac-za-investitore |accessdate=17 March 2019 |work=politika.rs |date=3 September 2017 |language=Serbian}}</ref>\n\n;Economic preview\n[[File:Saborna_crkva_april_2012a.jpg|thumb|right|Cathedral of [[Trinity|Holy Trinity]].]]\n[[File:Ni\u0161ava_River,_Ni\u0161,_Serbia.jpg|thumb|[[Ni\u0161ava]] river.]]\n[[File:Kazandzijsko_Nis.JPG|thumb|[[Tinkers Alley]], old urban downtown built in the first half of the [[18th century]].]]\n\nThe following table gives a preview of total number of registered people employed in legal entities per their core activity (as of 2019):<ref name=\"stats19employees\">{{cite web |title=\u0417\u0430\u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u0443 \u0420\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0438 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0458\u0438, 2019. - \u0413\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0448\u045a\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0435\u043a - |url=https://publikacije.stat.gov.rs/G2020/Pdf/G20201018.pdf |website=stat.gov.rs |publisher=Statistical Office of Republic of Serbia |accessdate=15 March 2020 |language=Serbian |date=31 January 2020}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|- \n!

In the Ni\u0161 area, this major transportation and communication route is linked with the natural corridor formed by the [[Ni\u0161ava]] river valley, which runs Eastwards in the direction of [[Sofia]] and [[Istanbul]]. The city has been a passing station for the [[Orient Express]].\n\nThe first highways date back to the 1950s when Ni\u0161 was linked with capital Belgrade through the [[Brotherhood and Unity Highway]], the first in Central-Eastern Europe.\n\nHistorically, because of its location, the city had always great importance in the region. The first to take advantage of it was the [[Roman Empire]] that built the important road [[Via Militaris]], linking the city with ''Singidunum'' (current Belgrade) to the North and ''Constantinople'' (current Istanbul) to the southeast. Nowadays, the city is connected by the highway [[E75 in Serbia|E75]] with Belgrade and Central Europe in north, and [[Skopje]], [[Thessaloniki]] and [[Athens]] in the south. The road [[European route E80|E80]] connects Ni\u0161 with Sofia, Istanbul towards the Middle East, and [[Pristina]], [[Montenegro]] and the [[Adriatic Sea]] to the West. The road [[E771]] connects the city with [[Zaje\u010dar]], [[Kladovo]] and [[Drobeta-Turnu Severin]] in [[Romania]].\n\nThe city is also a major regional railway junction linking Serbia to Sofia and Istanbul.\n\nThe [[Ni\u0161 Constantine the Great Airport|Ni\u0161 Constantine the Great]] airport is the second most important airport in Serbia. The first airfield serving the city of Ni\u0161 was established in 1910, near the village of [[Donje Me\u0111urovo]]. In the 1930s then-national airline company [[Aeroput]] used the airport for civil service. In 1935 Aeroput included a stop in Ni\u0161 in its route linking Belgrade with Skoplje.<ref>[http://www.europeanairlines.no/drustvo-za-vazdusni-saobracaj-a-d-aeroput-1927-1948/ Drustvo za Vazdusni Saobracaj A D \u2013 Aeroput (1927-1948)] at europeanairlines.no</ref>\n\nThe city public transportation consists nowadays of 13 bus lines.

The position of Ni\u0161 is strategically important, at the intersection of European highway and railway networks connecting Europe with Asia. Ni\u0161 is easily accessible, having an airport \u2013 [[Ni\u0161 Constantine the Great Airport]] and being a point of intersection of numerous railroad and highway lines. \n{{wide image|Ni\u0161, panorama n\u00e1m\u011bst\u00ed.jpg|700px|Panorama picture of the Square of the [[Milan I of Serbia|King Milan I]].}}\nIt is in Ni\u0161 that the trunk road running from the north down the [[Morava River (Central Europe)|Morava River]] valley forks into two major lines:\n\n* the south one, leading to [[Thessalonica]] and [[Athens]], along the [[Vardar]] River valley,\n* and the east one, running along the [[Nisava]] and the [[Maritsa|Marica]], leading towards Sofia and Istanbul, and further on, towards the Near East.\n\nThese roads have been widely known from ancient times, because they represented the beaten tracks along which peoples, goods and armies moved. Known as 'Via Militaris' in [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Byzantine]] periods, or 'Constantinople road' in Middle Ages, these roads still represent major European traffic arteries. Ni\u0161 thus stands at a point of intersection of the roads connecting Asia Minor to Europe, and the [[Black Sea]] to the Mediterranean. Nis had been a relatively developed city in the former Yugoslavia. In 1981, its GDP per capita was 110% of the Yugoslav average.<ref>{{cite book|title=Atlas svijeta: Novi pogled na Zemlju|year=1984|edition=3rd|publisher=Sveu\u010dili\u0161na naklada Liber|location=Zagreb|language=Croatian|editor1-first=Radovan|editor1-last=Radovinovi\u0107|editor2-first=Ivan|editor2-last=Berti\u0107}}</ref>\n\nAs of September 2017, Ni\u0161 has one of 14 [[free economic zone]]s established in Serbia.<ref name=\"srbeconomiczone2017\">{{cite news |last1=Mikavica |first1=A. |title=Slobodne zone mamac za investitore |url=http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/388105/Slobodne-zone-mamac-za-investitore |accessdate=17 March 2019 |work=politika.rs |date=3 September 2017 |language=Serbian}}</ref>\n\n;Economic preview\n[[File:Saborna_crkva_april_2012a.jpg|thumb|right|Cathedral of [[Trinity|Holy Trinity]].]]\n[[File:Ni\u0161ava_River,_Ni\u0161,_Serbia.jpg|thumb|[[Ni\u0161ava]] river.]]\n[[File:Kazandzijsko_Nis.JPG|thumb|[[Tinkers Alley]], old urban downtown built in the first half of the [[18th century]].]]\n\nThe following table gives a preview of total number of registered people employed in legal entities per their core activity (as of 2019):<ref name=\"stats19employees\">{{cite web |title=\u0417\u0430\u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u0443 \u0420\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0438 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0458\u0438, 2019. - \u0413\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0448\u045a\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0435\u043a - |url=https://publikacije.stat.gov.rs/G2020/Pdf/G20201018.pdf |website=stat.gov.rs |publisher=Statistical Office of Republic of Serbia |accessdate=15 March 2020 |language=Serbian |date=31 January 2020}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|- \n!

In the Ni\u0161 area, this major transportation and communication route is linked with the natural corridor formed by the [[Ni\u0161ava]] river valley, which runs Eastwards in the direction of [[Sofia]] and [[Istanbul]]. The city has been a passing station for the [[Orient Express]].\n\nThe first highways date back to the 1950s when Ni\u0161 was linked with capital Belgrade through the [[Brotherhood and Unity Highway]], the first in Central-Eastern Europe.\n\nHistorically, because of its location, the city had always great importance in the region. The first to take advantage of it was the [[Roman Empire]] that built the important road [[Via Militaris]], linking the city with ''Singidunum'' (current Belgrade) to the North and ''Constantinople'' (current Istanbul) to the southeast. Nowadays, the city is connected by the highway [[E75 in Serbia|E75]] with Belgrade and Central Europe in north, and [[Skopje]], [[Thessaloniki]] and [[Athens]] in the south. The road [[European route E80|E80]] connects Ni\u0161 with Sofia, Istanbul towards the Middle East, and [[Pristina]], [[Montenegro]] and the [[Adriatic Sea]] to the West. The road [[E771]] connects the city with [[Zaje\u010dar]], [[Kladovo]] and [[Drobeta-Turnu Severin]] in [[Romania]].\n\nThe city is also a major regional railway junction linking Serbia to Sofia and Istanbul.\n\nThe [[Ni\u0161 Constantine the Great Airport|Ni\u0161 Constantine the Great]] airport is the second most important airport in Serbia. The first airfield serving the city of Ni\u0161 was established in 1910, near the village of [[Donje Me\u0111urovo]]. In the 1930s then-national airline company [[Aeroput]] used the airport for civil service.

He grew up in [[Camlough]], [[County Armagh]], and was equally fluent in Irish and English.\n\nIn 1906, when he was 14, Donn-Byrne went to an Irish Volunteer Movement meeting with Bulmer Hobson and Robert Lynd of the London Daily News, where Lynd noticed him, a fair-haired boy, and wrote of his singing. It was through Hobson that Byrne acquired his taste for Irish history and nationalism. (The \"taste for nationalism\" cited, is contested by Bradley. Many may confuse widespread interest in Irish Language and Byrne's excellence in the language, his prizes at feiseanna (festivals) with a more revolutionary political movement engaged in by Hobson and other associates). He attended the [[University of Dublin]], beginning in 1907, where he studied Romance languages and saw his own writing published in ''The National Student'', the student magazine. After graduation he continued his studies in Europe, hoping to join the British Foreign Office. It is related that he \"turned down his PhD\" when he learned that he would have to wear evening clothes to his early morning examinations, which he apparently felt that no true Irish gentleman would ever do. (The latter claim is shown by Bradley to be just one of Byrne's impossible, if entertaining, fantasies)\n\nHe returned to New York in 1911, where he began working first for the publishers of the ''Catholic Encyclopedia'', the ''New Standard Dictionary'', and then the'' Century Dictionary''. In February 1912 his poem \"The Piper\" appeared in ''Harper'''s magazine. His first short story, \"Battle,\" sold soon after to ''Smart Set'' magazine for $50, appearing in the February 1914 issue. He sold more stories; some of these were anthologised in his first book, ''Stories Without Women'', 1915. He then began working on his first novel, ''The Stranger's Banque''t (1919). He was a prolific novelist and short story writer from that point on. His novel ''Field of Honor'' was published posthumously in 1929. His poems were collected into an anthology and published as Poems (1934).\n\nDespite both his wife's success as a playwright, and his own increasing popularity as an author, Byrne's financial straits forced his family to sell their house in Riverside, Connecticut, and return to Ireland. They later purchased Coolmain Castle, near Bandon in County Cork, where Byrne lived until his death in a car accident due to defective steering,<ref>New York Times, 20 June 1928</ref> in June 1928. A Kilbrittain man Cornelius O'Sullivan who witnessed the incident pulled him from the water and tried to revive him, but to no avail. He is buried in Rathclarin churchyard, near Coolmain Castle. His headstone reads, in Irish and English: \"I am in my sleeping and don't waken me.\"<ref>It first appears in ''Ireland: The Rock Whence I Was Hewn'', where Byrne concludes with the following poem:\n\nThe bells of heather/\nHave ceased ringing their Angelus./\nSleepy June weather/\nHas instilled a drug in us.//\n\nThe cry of the plover/\nIs hushed, and the friendly dark/\nHas drawn a blue hood over/\nThe meadow lark.//\n\nWe travel sleeping,/\nOver heather hill and through ferny dale,/\nTo the Land of No Weeping,/\nOf races, and piping and ale.//\n\nHushenn! Hushoo!//\n\nThe wind is hid in the mountain. The leaves/\nare still on the tree./\nThe hawk is caged in the darkness. The field-/\nmouse safe in the hay./\nNow I am in my sleeping, and don't waken me./\nTha mee mo hulloo is na dhooshy may!/\nTha mee, Tha mee--/\nGolden mammy!/\nTha mee mo hulloo is na dhooshy may!/\nI am in my sleeping and don't waken me!//\n\nQuoted from the National Geographic version. (Vol. 51, no. 3, March 1927, page 316).</ref>\n\n== Writings ==\nThe early novels can be said to be quite mediocre, noted as \"[[potboiler]]s\" by Thurston Macauley, Byrne's earliest biographer. ''Messsa Marco Polo'' tells the story of the Italian adventurer as told by an Irishman, and ''The Wind Bloweth'' is a romantic novel of the sea. Both show some highly lyrical passages intermixed with the plain language of real life. With ''Blind Raftery'', however, the author seems to reinvent the saga style, the prose breaking off into musical verse now and then as it tells the story of a blind poet wandering Ireland and avenging his wife's dishonor. A television opera based on the novel by [[Joan Trimble]] was commissioned and broadcast by the [[BBC]] in 1957.<ref>[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/page/8fba50823e2e4413b76ff784e78a624a ''Radio Times'' Issue 1749, 19 May 1957, p 6, 17]</ref> \n\nHis later novels invited comparison with Irish novelist [[George Moore (novelist)|George Moore]], especially in their romance and historical themes. It was with Hangman's, though, that he began to identify himself with the traditional Irish storytellers, noting in his preface (\"A Foreword to Foreigner's\") that: \"I have written a book of Ireland for Irishmen. Some phrase, some name in it may conjure up the world they knew as children.\" It is also in this novel that Byrne returns to his Irish nationalist ideas by alluding to the ongoing strife of the Irish Civil War and fight for Independence.\n\nByrne was firmly of the neo-Romantic view of the mythical and pastoral beauty of Irish history.

He grew up in [[Camlough]], [[County Armagh]], and was equally fluent in Irish and English.\n\nIn 1906, when he was 14, Donn-Byrne went to an Irish Volunteer Movement meeting with Bulmer Hobson and Robert Lynd of the London Daily News, where Lynd noticed him, a fair-haired boy, and wrote of his singing. It was through Hobson that Byrne acquired his taste for Irish history and nationalism. (The \"taste for nationalism\" cited, is contested by Bradley. Many may confuse widespread interest in Irish Language and Byrne's excellence in the language, his prizes at feiseanna (festivals) with a more revolutionary political movement engaged in by Hobson and other associates). He attended the [[University of Dublin]], beginning in 1907, where he studied Romance languages and saw his own writing published in ''The National Student'', the student magazine. After graduation he continued his studies in Europe, hoping to join the British Foreign Office. It is related that he \"turned down his PhD\" when he learned that he would have to wear evening clothes to his early morning examinations, which he apparently felt that no true Irish gentleman would ever do. (The latter claim is shown by Bradley to be just one of Byrne's impossible, if entertaining, fantasies)\n\nHe returned to New York in 1911, where he began working first for the publishers of the ''Catholic Encyclopedia'', the ''New Standard Dictionary'', and then the'' Century Dictionary''. In February 1912 his poem \"The Piper\" appeared in ''Harper'''s magazine. His first short story, \"Battle,\" sold soon after to ''Smart Set'' magazine for $50, appearing in the February 1914 issue. He sold more stories; some of these were anthologised in his first book, ''Stories Without Women'', 1915. He then began working on his first novel, ''The Stranger's Banque''t (1919). He was a prolific novelist and short story writer from that point on. His novel ''Field of Honor'' was published posthumously in 1929. His poems were collected into an anthology and published as Poems (1934).\n\nDespite both his wife's success as a playwright, and his own increasing popularity as an author, Byrne's financial straits forced his family to sell their house in Riverside, Connecticut, and return to Ireland. They later purchased Coolmain Castle, near Bandon in County Cork, where Byrne lived until his death in a car accident due to defective steering,<ref>New York Times, 20 June 1928</ref> in June 1928. A Kilbrittain man Cornelius O'Sullivan who witnessed the incident pulled him from the water and tried to revive him, but to no avail. He is buried in Rathclarin churchyard, near Coolmain Castle. His headstone reads, in Irish and English: \"I am in my sleeping and don't waken me.\"<ref>It first appears in ''Ireland: The Rock Whence I Was Hewn'', where Byrne concludes with the following poem:\n\nThe bells of heather/\nHave ceased ringing their Angelus./\nSleepy June weather/\nHas instilled a drug in us.//\n\nThe cry of the plover/\nIs hushed, and the friendly dark/\nHas drawn a blue hood over/\nThe meadow lark.//\n\nWe travel sleeping,/\nOver heather hill and through ferny dale,/\nTo the Land of No Weeping,/\nOf races, and piping and ale.//\n\nHushenn! Hushoo!//\n\nThe wind is hid in the mountain. The leaves/\nare still on the tree./\nThe hawk is caged in the darkness. The field-/\nmouse safe in the hay./\nNow I am in my sleeping, and don't waken me./\nTha mee mo hulloo is na dhooshy may!/\nTha mee, Tha mee--/\nGolden mammy!/\nTha mee mo hulloo is na dhooshy may!/\nI am in my sleeping and don't waken me!//\n\nQuoted from the National Geographic version. (Vol. 51, no. 3, March 1927, page 316).</ref>\n\n== Writings ==\nThe early novels can be said to be quite mediocre, noted as \"[[potboiler]]s\" by Thurston Macauley, Byrne's earliest biographer. ''Messsa Marco Polo'' tells the story of the Italian adventurer as told by an Irishman, and ''The Wind Bloweth'' is a romantic novel of the sea. Both show some highly lyrical passages intermixed with the plain language of real life. With Raftery, however, the author seems to reinvent the saga style, the prose breaking off into musical verse now and then as it tells the story of a blind poet wandering Ireland and avenging his wife's dishonor. A television opera based on the novel by [[Joan Trimble]] was commissioned and broadcast by the [[BBC]] in 1957.<ref>[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/page/8fba50823e2e4413b76ff784e78a624a ''Radio Times'' Issue 1749, 19 May 1957, p 6, 17]</ref> \n\nHis later novels invited comparison with Irish novelist [[George Moore (novelist)|George Moore]], especially in their romance and historical themes. It was with Hangman's, though, that he began to identify himself with the traditional Irish storytellers, noting in his preface (\"A Foreword to Foreigner's\") that: \"I have written a book of Ireland for Irishmen. Some phrase, some name in it may conjure up the world they knew as children.\" It is also in this novel that Byrne returns to his Irish nationalist ideas by alluding to the ongoing strife of the Irish Civil War and fight for Independence.\n\nByrne was firmly of the neo-Romantic view of the mythical and pastoral beauty of Irish history. His writing hauntingly evokes these images, sometimes seeming want to preserve them. \"It seemed to me,\" he says in Wind, \"that I was capturing for an instant a beauty that was dying slowly, imperceptibly, but would soon be gone.\" His simple narrative style is rarely found today,{{Peacock term|date=September 2016}} and has the atmosphere of ancient oral epics such as ''[[Taine Bo Cualinge]]'' and the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]''.\n\nSome of the works were published in the United Kingdom under different titles. These are also noted after the American title.\n\n==Works==\n=== Novels ===\n* The Stranger's Banquet (1919)\n* The Foolish Matrons (1920)\n* Messer Marco Polo<ref>{{gutenberg|no=2058|name=Messer Marco Polo by Brian Oswald Donn-Byrne}}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n|title=Messer Marco Polo\n|author=Donn Byrne\n|year=1921\n|publisher=The Century Co.\n|isbn=\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WHAQAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=inauthor:%22Donn+Byrne%22\n}}</ref> (1921)\n* The Wind Bloweth<ref>{{gutenberg|no=21999|name=The Wind Bloweth by Brian Oswald Donn-Byrne}}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n|title=The Wind Bloweth . \n|author=Donn Byrne\n|year=1922\n|publisher=The Century Co.\n|isbn=\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nG4QAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=inauthor:%22Donn+Byrne%22\n}}</ref> (1922) (illustrated by George Bellows)\n* Blind Raftery and His Wife Hilaria (1924)\n* O'Malley of Shanganagh (1925), or An Untitled Story\n* Hangman's House (1926)\n* Brother Saul (1927)\n* Crusade (1928)\n* Field of Honor (1929), or The Power of the Dog\n* A Party of Bacarat (1930), or The Golden Goat\n\n=== Short story collections ===\nDoherty, 1997,<ref>Doherty, John J.

The track was deep, especially along the rail, resulting in slow times across the card. Monomoy Girl tracked the early pace in third while Midnight Bisou sat a few lengths farther back in fifth. Monomoy Girl took the lead without urging as they exited the backstretch and gradually opened up her lead. Midnight Bisou started her move on the outside then moved to the rail as she started to make up ground in the stretch. In midstretch, Monomoy Girl began to wander toward the rail so Midnight Bisou was switched to the outside. Then Monomoy Girl began to drift steadily towards the outside, forcing Midnight Bisou to move out still further. At the wire, Monomoy Girl was ahead by a neck but wound up being disqualified in a controversial decision. \"I went inside because everyone was going out,\" said Smith, \"and I was going straight as an arrow.

Alexander led Murray State for four seasons, posting a 45-54 record, including a 15-10 mark in 1955-56. But after his first team was Ohio Valley Conference regular-season and tournament runners-up, his teams never finished higher than third in the conference and he was replaced by DePauw University head coach Cal Luther on March 5, 1958. Alexander agreed to stay on as an assistant coach under Luther.\n\n===Luther era (1959\u20131974)===\n\nIn 1958, Murray State hired [[Cal Luther]], who had served the previous four seasons as head coach at [[DePauw Tigers|DePauw]]. In 16 seasons under Luther, Murray State won three OVC regular-season championships and made the NCAA Tournament in [[1964 NCAA University Division Basketball Tournament|1964]] and [[1969 NCAA University Division Basketball Tournament|1969]]. His 1970-71 team reached No. 17 in the [[Associated Press Poll|Associated Press poll]], entering the rankings after a thrilling 73-71 victory over [[Western Kentucky Hilltoppers basketball|Western Kentucky]] in Murray. WKU would go on to reach the [[1971 NCAA Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] Final Four that season. A two-time OVC Coach of the Year, Luther led the Racers to a 241-134 record.\n\nLuther's most notable players were future professional players [[Dick Cunningham]], [[Claude Virden]] and [[Stew Johnson|Stewart Johnson]], as well as Racer greats Herb McPherson, Jim Jennings and Les Taylor.\n\nCal Luther was a firebrand of a coach. The standing joke at the university was the over and under of Cal throwing off his jacket during a game due to a call by a ref, or from frustration with a player. The latter part of his tenure was marred by an OVC issue with testing and which tests the schools in the OVC used to qualify athletes. During the 1973-74 season several players were disqualified for using an illegal testing equivalency. This happened across the OVC, and Murray was not the only school to lose student athletes. Most of the disqualified athletes were allowed to transfer by the NCAA to other schools, but OVC schools lost the services of those athletes who had not actually taken the SAT, but had taken the ACT.\n\n===Overton era (1975\u20131978)===\n\nAfter three seasons as an assistant under Cal Luther, [[Fred Overton]] was elevated to head coach in 1975. After a 9-17 first season, the Racers started the 1976-77 season with a 17-6 record before dropping their last four games for a 17-10 final ledger, finishing second in the OVC. But after the Racers posted an 8-17 in 1977-78, Overton was fired.<ref>[http://racerhistory.com Racerhistory.com]</ref>\n\n===Greene era (1978\u20131985)===\n[[Ron Greene]] returned to his alma mater fresh off earning the AP Southeastern Conference Coach of the Year award at Mississippi State in 1978.\n\nAfter managing only four wins in his first season as coach at Murray, Greene led the Racers to 23 wins the following year and an appearance in the [[National Invitation Tournament]]. The Racers knocked off Jacksonville and Alabama before losing to Illinois 65-63 in the quarterfinals, all on the road. Greene's Racers would win three Ohio Valley Conference regular-season titles and reach the NIT twice more under his guidance.\n\nA highlight of the 1981\u201382 season came when Murray State traveled to South Bend, Indiana, to play against [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's basketball|Notre Dame]].  Murray State defeated a [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's basketball|Notre Dame]] team coached by [[Digger Phelps]] 56-54.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/08/sports/murray-state-56-notre-dame-54.html | work=The New York Times | title=Murray State 56 Notre Dame 54 | date=8 December 1981}}</ref>\n\nHis overall record at Murray State was 119-78.

Martin did not make the team but impressed many with his performance.\n\nThe best-known player in the Newton era is [[Popeye Jones]].  While at Murray State, Jones scored 2,057 points which still ranks fourth all time for the Racers. He is also Murray State's all-time leader in rebounds with 1,374, and led the nation in that category in the 1990\u201391 season. Jones is the only player in MSU history to record more than 2,000 points and 1,000 rebounds.  Jones helped lead the Racers to OVC championships in 1991 and 1992. He went on to have a successful career in the NBA after being drafted in the second round by the [[Houston Rockets]] in the 1992 NBA Draft.\n\n===Edgar era (1992\u20131995)===\n\n[[Scott Edgar (basketball)|Scott Edgar]] was hired as head basketball coach after serving six seasons as an assistant coach under [[Nolan Richardson]] at [[Arkansas Razorbacks men's basketball|Arkansas]]. Bringing a version of Richardson's uptempo \"40 Minutes of Hell\" philosophy to Murray, Edgar led the Racers to two NCAA tournament appearances ([[1992 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1992]], [[1995 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1995]]) and one NIT appearance ([[1994 National Invitation Tournament|1994]]) in four seasons. His teams won three OVC regular-season championships (1992, 1994 and 1995), posting a 48-14 record in conference games during his tenure.\n\nEdgar recruited Racer greats [[Marcus Brown]] and Vincent Rainey to Murray State, with Brown averaging 22.4 points and Rainey 18.8 points in Edgar's final season at Murray.\n\nEdgar left Murray State after the 1994-95 season to become head coach at [[Duquesne Dukes men's basketball|Duquesne]].\n\n===Gottfried era (1995\u20131998)===\n[[Mark Gottfried]] was hired as head basketball coach after serving seven seasons as an assistant coach under [[Jim Harrick]] at [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]]. Gottfried was hired shortly after he finished the 1995 season with the Bruins, in which he helped lead the Bruins to an [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship]]. Mark Gottfried was also the nephew of ESPN analyst and former Murray State football coach [[Mike Gottfried]].\n\nIn Gottfried's first season, the Racers returned four starters, including [[Marcus Brown]], from the Racer team that nearly upset North Carolina in the 1995 NCAA Tournament, and the team was picked to finished first in the OVC. The Racers won the Ohio Valley Conference regular season championship in 1996 for the third straight season; however, the Racers were defeated in the OVC tournament. In the final game of the tournament, Murray State's Vincent Rainey was charged with a foul with two-tenths of a second left on the clock in a tie game against the rival [[Austin Peay Governors]]. APSU's Reggie Crenshaw made two free throws and the Racers lost the game 70-68. As a result of the loss, the Racers did not reach the 1996 NCAA Tournament. The Racers lost to the [[Missouri Tigers]] in the opening round of the 1996 National Invitational Tournament, and finished the season 19-10. [[Marcus Brown]] finished his college playing career at the close of the 1996 season with 2,236 career points, which is third best in Murray State history.\n\nWith a November 23, 1996, victory over the [[Belmont Bruins men's basketball|Belmont Bruins]], the Racers began a 47-game home winning streak that would last into the 1999\u20132000 season. The Racers won the 1997 OVC Tournament with an overtime win over Austin Peay and earned a spot in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nESPN's College Basketball Encyclopedia names the Racers 1997\u201398 season as having the best team in school history. OVC player of the year De'Teri Mayes led the 1997\u201398 team to 23 victories by double digit margins. Isaac Spencer was a freshman on the team. Spencer would go on to score 2,248 points over four seasons, which places him second place all time for the Racers. The Racers won both the OVC regular season and OVC tournament again in 1998; however, Murray State fell to number eight seed Rhode Island in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. The Racers finished the season a number 25 ranking in the final AP Poll. Mark Gottfried won three Ohio Valley Conference Championships in each of his three seasons, the only OVC coach to accomplish such a mark.<ref>{{cite web|title=''Mark Gottfried''|work=Rolltide.com|url=http://www.rolltide.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=8000&ATCLID=239593|date=2002-05-02|accessdate=2007-03-05}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>''ESPN College Basketball Encyclopedia: The Complete History of the Men's Game''. 2009. p 31.</ref>\n\nGottfried was hired by [[Alabama Crimson Tide men's basketball|Alabama]] to be head basketball coach in March 1998. He had been a starting player for the Crimson Tide for three seasons between 1985 and 1987.\n\n===Anderson era (1998\u20132003)===\n[[Tevester Anderson]] was promoted to head coach of the Racers in March, 1998 after [[Mark Gottfried]] left Murray State to take the head coach position at the [[University of Alabama]]. Anderson, the first African American to serve as head coach of the Murray State men's basketball team, had previously served as an assistant coach under Gottfried during the previous three seasons. At age 61, Anderson was also the oldest rookie head coach in NCAA Division I basketball. In his first year as coach of the Racers, Anderson led the team to a 27-6 record, an Ohio Valley Conference championship, and an NCAA Tournament appearance. Anderson was named the OVC's Co-Coach of the Year and was named NABC District 7 Coach of the Year following the 1998\u201399 season.<ref>\"Anderson Hired at Murray State\". ''Kentucky New Era''.

The record was good enough to capture a share of the OVC regular season championship, but the Racer's failed to win the OVC Tournament and earn a spot in the NCAA Tournament. Murray State home court winning streak, the longest in the nation, also came to an end in 2000 with a January 15 loss to [[Southeast Missouri State University]].\n\nOver the next three years under Anderson, the success of the Racer basketball program steadily declined, culminating in a low point during the 2002\u201303 season. The Racers finished the 2002\u201303 season with a 17-12 record, which was fourth-place in the OVC standings. The fourth-place finish was the worst finish in the OVC standings since the 1986\u201387 season. Amid rumors that Anderson would relinquish his coaching duties at Murray State under pressure from university officials, he resigned from the head coach position in March 2003.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://murrayledger.com/anderson-retires-as-racers-head-coach/article_07d9a74c-dd7b-575b-95a4-23568d84d141.html |title=Anderson retires as Racers' head coach - Murray Ledger & Times: Home |publisher=Murrayledger.com |date=2003-03-24 |accessdate=2015-06-21}}</ref> Anderson was named as the new head coach at [[Jackson State University]] in April 2003.<ref>{{cite web |author= |url=http://murrayledger.com/anderson-to-take-over-at-jackson-state/article_a355ded1-0ab3-5b7c-982b-5d678d5c2169.html |title=Anderson to take over at Jackson State - Murray Ledger & Times: Home |publisher=Murrayledger.com |date=2003-04-09 |accessdate=2015-06-21}}</ref>\n\n===Cronin era (2003\u20132006)===\nPreviously an assistant at [[Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball|Cincinnati]] (1997\u20132001) under [[Bob Huggins]] and at [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Louisville]] (2001\u201303) under [[Rick Pitino]], Mick Cronin was introduced as the new head coach of the Racers on April 5, 2003. When he accepted the position, Cronin became the fourth youngest head coach in NCAA Division-I basketball. In Cronin's first season as head coach, the Racers won the OVC tournament and advanced to the first round of the NCAA Tournament where the Racers fell to No. 5 seeded Illinois. The success of the 2003\u201304 season was also tainted by arrests and suspensions. Just before the start of the 2004 NCAA Tournament, juniors Adam Chiles and Kelvin Brown were arrested on drug charges. Chiles was charged with hindering prosecution and possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia, and Brown was charged with theft from an alleged gas drive-off, possession of marijuana, and his second offense of possession of drug paraphernalia. Both were arrested following a 911 hangup call from their apartment in which Chiles was found outside and Brown was found hiding in a closet. Chiles was cleared to play in the tournament, but Brown was suspended indefinitely and later dismissed from the team in April.<ref>\"Drugs, suspension taint Racers' glorious season\". The Murray State News. March 26, 2004. p 1</ref>\n\nProblems continued for the Racers in the 2004\u201305 season. The team's only returning starter, Adam Chiles, was dismissed from the team in November following his second arrest of 2004. Chiles was stopped by Kentucky State Police while driving on [[Western Kentucky Parkway]] near [[Leitchfield, Kentucky]]. Chiles was charged with driving under the influence, possession of marijuana, possession of an open alcoholic beverage container, and speeding. Chiles had averaged 10.1 points and 3.9 assists for the Racers in the previous season. The Racers went on to finish the 2004\u201305 season with a record of 20-10 and a first round loss in the OVC tournament.<ref>\"Murray State dismisses player after arrest\". Portsmouth Daily Times.

The Racers were eliminated from the OVC tournament in 2011; however, they earned a number six seed in the [[National Invitational Tournament]] where the Racers suffered a first round loss to [[Missouri State University]].

Alexander led Murray State for four seasons, posting a 45-54 record, including a 15-10 mark in 1955-56. But after his first team was Ohio Valley Conference regular-season and tournament runners-up, his teams never finished higher than third in the conference and he was replaced by DePauw University head coach Cal Luther on March 5, 1958. Alexander agreed to stay on as an assistant coach under Luther.\n\n===Luther era (1959\u20131974)===\n\nIn 1958, Murray State hired [[Cal Luther]], who had served the previous four seasons as head coach at [[DePauw Tigers|DePauw]]. In 16 seasons under Luther, Murray State won three OVC regular-season championships and made the NCAA Tournament in [[1964 NCAA University Division Basketball Tournament|1964]] and [[1969 NCAA University Division Basketball Tournament|1969]]. His 1970-71 team reached No. 17 in the [[Associated Press Poll|Associated Press poll]], entering the rankings after a thrilling 73-71 victory over [[Western Kentucky Hilltoppers basketball|Western Kentucky]] in Murray. WKU would go on to reach the [[1971 NCAA Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] Final Four that season. A two-time OVC Coach of the Year, Luther led the Racers to a 241-134 record.\n\nLuther's most notable players were future professional players [[Dick Cunningham]], [[Claude Virden]] and [[Stew Johnson|Stewart Johnson]], as well as Racer greats Herb McPherson, Jim Jennings and Les Taylor.\n\nCal Luther was a firebrand of a coach. The standing joke at the university was the over and under of Cal throwing off his jacket during a game due to a call by a ref, or from frustration with a player. The latter part of his tenure was marred by an OVC issue with testing and which tests the schools in the OVC used to qualify athletes. During the 1973-74 season several players were disqualified for using an illegal testing equivalency. This happened across the OVC, and Murray was not the only school to lose student athletes. Most of the disqualified athletes were allowed to transfer by the NCAA to other schools, but OVC schools lost the services of those athletes who had not actually taken the SAT, but had taken the ACT.\n\n===Overton era (1975\u20131978)===\n\nAfter three seasons as an assistant under Cal Luther, [[Fred Overton]] was elevated to head coach in 1975. After a 9-17 first season, the Racers started the 1976-77 season with a 17-6 record before dropping their last four games for a 17-10 final ledger, finishing second in the OVC. But after the Racers posted an 8-17 in 1977-78, Overton was fired.<ref>[http://racerhistory.com Racerhistory.com]</ref>\n\n===Greene era (1978\u20131985)===\n[[Ron Greene]] returned to his alma mater fresh off earning the AP Southeastern Conference Coach of the Year award at Mississippi State in 1978.\n\nAfter managing only four wins in his first season as coach at Murray, Greene led the Racers to 23 wins the following year and an appearance in the [[National Invitation Tournament]]. The Racers knocked off Jacksonville and Alabama before losing to Illinois 65-63 in the quarterfinals, all on the road. Greene's Racers would win three Ohio Valley Conference regular-season titles and reach the NIT twice more under his guidance.\n\nA highlight of the 1981\u201382 season came when Murray State traveled to South Bend, Indiana, to play against [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's basketball|Notre Dame]].  Murray State defeated a [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's basketball|Notre Dame]] team coached by [[Digger Phelps]] 56-54.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/08/sports/murray-state-56-notre-dame-54.html | work=The New York Times | title=Murray State 56 Notre Dame 54 | date=8 December 1981}}</ref>\n\nHis overall record at Murray State was 119-78.

Martin did not make the team but impressed many with his performance.\n\nThe best-known player in the Newton era is [[Popeye Jones]].  While at Murray State, Jones scored 2,057 points which still ranks fourth all time for the Racers. He is also Murray State's all-time leader in rebounds with 1,374, and led the nation in that category in the 1990\u201391 season. Jones is the only player in MSU history to record more than 2,000 points and 1,000 rebounds.  Jones helped lead the Racers to OVC championships in 1991 and 1992. He went on to have a successful career in the NBA after being drafted in the second round by the [[Houston Rockets]] in the 1992 NBA Draft.\n\n===Edgar era (1992\u20131995)===\n\n[[Scott Edgar (basketball)|Scott Edgar]] was hired as head basketball coach after serving six seasons as an assistant coach under [[Nolan Richardson]] at [[Arkansas Razorbacks men's basketball|Arkansas]]. Bringing a version of Richardson's uptempo \"40 Minutes of Hell\" philosophy to Murray, Edgar led the Racers to two NCAA tournament appearances ([[1992 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1992]], [[1995 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|1995]]) and one NIT appearance ([[1994 National Invitation Tournament|1994]]) in four seasons. His teams won three OVC regular-season championships (1992, 1994 and 1995), posting a 48-14 record in conference games during his tenure.\n\nEdgar recruited Racer greats [[Marcus Brown]] and Vincent Rainey to Murray State, with Brown averaging 22.4 points and Rainey 18.8 points in Edgar's final season at Murray.\n\nEdgar left Murray State after the 1994-95 season to become head coach at [[Duquesne Dukes men's basketball|Duquesne]].\n\n===Gottfried era (1995\u20131998)===\n[[Mark Gottfried]] was hired as head basketball coach after serving seven seasons as an assistant coach under [[Jim Harrick]] at [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]]. Gottfried was hired shortly after he finished the 1995 season with the Bruins, in which he helped lead the Bruins to an [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship]]. Mark Gottfried was also the nephew of ESPN analyst and former Murray State football coach [[Mike Gottfried]].\n\nIn Gottfried's first season, the Racers returned four starters, including [[Marcus Brown]], from the Racer team that nearly upset North Carolina in the 1995 NCAA Tournament, and the team was picked to finished first in the OVC. The Racers won the Ohio Valley Conference regular season championship in 1996 for the third straight season; however, the Racers were defeated in the OVC tournament. In the final game of the tournament, Murray State's Vincent Rainey was charged with a foul with two-tenths of a second left on the clock in a tie game against the rival [[Austin Peay Governors]]. APSU's Reggie Crenshaw made two free throws and the Racers lost the game 70-68. As a result of the loss, the Racers did not reach the 1996 NCAA Tournament. The Racers lost to the [[Missouri Tigers]] in the opening round of the 1996 National Invitational Tournament, and finished the season 19-10. [[Marcus Brown]] finished his college playing career at the close of the 1996 season with 2,236 career points, which is third best in Murray State history.\n\nWith a November 23, 1996, victory over the [[Belmont Bruins men's basketball|Belmont Bruins]], the Racers began a 47-game home winning streak that would last into the 1999\u20132000 season. The Racers won the 1997 OVC Tournament with an overtime win over Austin Peay and earned a spot in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nESPN's College Basketball Encyclopedia names the Racers 1997\u201398 season as having the best team in school history. OVC player of the year De'Teri Mayes led the 1997\u201398 team to 23 victories by double digit margins. Isaac Spencer was a freshman on the team. Spencer would go on to score 2,248 points over four seasons, which places him second place all time for the Racers. The Racers won both the OVC regular season and OVC tournament again in 1998; however, Murray State fell to number eight seed Rhode Island in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. The Racers finished the season a number 25 ranking in the final AP Poll. Mark Gottfried won three Ohio Valley Conference Championships in each of his three seasons, the only OVC coach to accomplish such a mark.<ref>{{cite web|title=''Mark Gottfried''|work=Rolltide.com|url=http://www.rolltide.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=8000&ATCLID=239593|date=2002-05-02|accessdate=2007-03-05}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>''ESPN College Basketball Encyclopedia: The Complete History of the Men's Game''. 2009. p 31.</ref>\n\nGottfried was hired by [[Alabama Crimson Tide men's basketball|Alabama]] to be head basketball coach in March 1998. He had been a starting player for the Crimson Tide for three seasons between 1985 and 1987.\n\n===Anderson era (1998\u20132003)===\n[[Tevester Anderson]] was promoted to head coach of the Racers in March, 1998 after [[Mark Gottfried]] left Murray State to take the head coach position at the [[University of Alabama]]. Anderson, the first African American to serve as head coach of the Murray State men's basketball team, had previously served as an assistant coach under Gottfried during the previous three seasons. At age 61, Anderson was also the oldest rookie head coach in NCAA Division I basketball. In his first year as coach of the Racers, Anderson led the team to a 27-6 record, an Ohio Valley Conference championship, and an NCAA Tournament appearance. Anderson was named the OVC's Co-Coach of the Year and was named NABC District 7 Coach of the Year following the 1998\u201399 season.<ref>\"Anderson Hired at Murray State\". ''Kentucky New Era''. March 28, 1998. p 3B.</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1015130/index.htm | work=CNN | title=Rookie Of The Year | date=22 February 1999}}</ref>\n\nIn Anderson's second year as head coach, the Racers finished the 1999\u20132000 season with a 23-9 record. The record was good enough to capture a share of the OVC regular season championship, but the Racer's failed to win the OVC Tournament and earn a spot in the NCAA Tournament. Murray State home court winning streak, the longest in the nation, also came to an end in 2000 with a January 15 loss to [[Southeast Missouri State University]].\n\nOver the next three years under Anderson, the success of the Racer basketball program steadily declined, culminating in a low point during the 2002\u201303 season. The Racers finished the 2002\u201303 season with a 17-12 record, which was fourth-place in the OVC standings. The fourth-place finish was the worst finish in the OVC standings since the 1986\u201387 season. Amid rumors that Anderson would relinquish his coaching duties at Murray State under pressure from university officials, he resigned from the head coach position in March 2003.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://murrayledger.com/anderson-retires-as-racers-head-coach/article_07d9a74c-dd7b-575b-95a4-23568d84d141.html |title=Anderson retires as Racers' head coach - Murray Ledger & Times: Home |publisher=Murrayledger.com |date=2003-03-24 |accessdate=2015-06-21}}</ref> Anderson was named as the new head coach at [[Jackson State University]] in April 2003.<ref>{{cite web |author= |url=http://murrayledger.com/anderson-to-take-over-at-jackson-state/article_a355ded1-0ab3-5b7c-982b-5d678d5c2169.html |title=Anderson to take over at Jackson State - Murray Ledger & Times: Home |publisher=Murrayledger.com |date=2003-04-09 |accessdate=2015-06-21}}</ref>\n\n===Cronin era (2003\u20132006)===\nPreviously an assistant at [[Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball|Cincinnati]] (1997\u20132001) under [[Bob Huggins]] and at [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Louisville]] (2001\u201303) under [[Rick Pitino]], Mick Cronin was introduced as the new head coach of the Racers on April 5, 2003. When he accepted the position, Cronin became the fourth youngest head coach in NCAA Division-I basketball. In Cronin's first season as head coach, the Racers won the OVC tournament and advanced to the first round of the NCAA Tournament where the Racers fell to No. 5 seeded Illinois. The success of the 2003\u201304 season was also tainted by arrests and suspensions. Just before the start of the 2004 NCAA Tournament, juniors Adam Chiles and Kelvin Brown were arrested on drug charges. Chiles was charged with hindering prosecution and possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia, and Brown was charged with theft from an alleged gas drive-off, possession of marijuana, and his second offense of possession of drug paraphernalia. Both were arrested following a 911 hangup call from their apartment in which Chiles was found outside and Brown was found hiding in a closet. Chiles was cleared to play in the tournament, but Brown was suspended indefinitely and later dismissed from the team in April.<ref>\"Drugs, suspension taint Racers' glorious season\". The Murray State News. March 26, 2004. p 1</ref>\n\nProblems continued for the Racers in the 2004\u201305 season. The team's only returning starter, Adam Chiles, was dismissed from the team in November following his second arrest of 2004. Chiles was stopped by Kentucky State Police while driving on [[Western Kentucky Parkway]] near [[Leitchfield, Kentucky]]. Chiles was charged with driving under the influence, possession of marijuana, possession of an open alcoholic beverage container, and speeding. Chiles had averaged 10.1 points and 3.9 assists for the Racers in the previous season. The Racers went on to finish the 2004\u201305 season with a record of 20-10 and a first round loss in the OVC tournament.<ref>\"Murray State dismisses player after arrest\". Portsmouth Daily Times.

This was the first time that any Ohio Valley Conference team had advanced to the 2nd round of the NCAA Tournament since [[Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders|Middle Tennessee]] advanced in 1989. The Racers followed up a regular season conference championship for the second year in a row in 2011. The Racers were eliminated from the OVC tournament in 2011; however, they earned a number six seed in the [[National Invitational Tournament]] where the Racers suffered a first round loss to [[Missouri State University]].

Use of the Ferrari name (which she justified as it was her maternal grandfather's surname) led to lengthy trademark infringement court battles with the Italian [[Ferrari]] automobile company when she tried to market a line of underwear called Ferrari Underwear and a Lolo Ferrari doll. \n\nIn an effort to promote herself, she went with her husband to the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 1995.

She caused a sensation at the 1996 [[Cannes Film Festival]] with the presentation of the movie during a remake of the boxing match in ''Camping Cosmos'' between the European champion and the former opponent of [[Muhammad Ali|Cassius Clay]] ([[Jean-Pierre Coopman]]).<ref>Interview with Jean-Pierre Coopman in the Flemish periodical ''Humo'' 3415, pp. 50\u201355, 14 February 2006.</ref>\n\nShe used her newly won publicity to obtain a regular role on the British [[Channel 4]] television show ''[[Eurotrash (TV series)|Eurotrash]]''. The media hype led to appearances on other European shows and work in cabaret shows doing a song and [[striptease]] act. Hoping to launch a pop music career, she recorded two singles, titled \"Airbag Generation\" and \"Set Me Free\", as well as two more singles, a [[Euro disco]] cabaret song called \"Dance Dance Dance\", and a cover of [[Thelma Houston]]'s Euro disco hit, \"[[Don't Leave Me This Way]]\". Neither of the latter two songs was given a commercial release.\n\n==Death==\nOn the morning of 5 March 2000, at the age of 37, Ferrari was found dead, of undetermined causes, by her husband at her home in [[Grasse]] in the [[Alpes-Maritimes]] d\u00e9partement on the [[French Riviera]].<ref name=bbc/> The original [[autopsy]] determined that she had died of an overdose of antidepressants and tranquilizers. She had been depressed and her death was ruled a suicide. Her parents suspected that her husband was involved, and a second autopsy approved two years later.

Her widower was suspected of causing her death, was arrested, and spent 13 months in prison.<ref name=c4/> After a second medical analysis, he was finally cleared of the charges in 2007.<ref name=20m>[http://www.20minutes.fr/article/140549/People-Le-mari-de-Lolo-Ferrari-blanchi.php \"Le mari de Lolo Ferrari blanchi\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130106215337/http://www.20minutes.fr/article/140549/People-Le-mari-de-Lolo-Ferrari-blanchi.php |date=6 January 2013 }}, 20minutes.fr, 20 February 2007.</ref>\n\nWhen Channel 4 broadcast Ferrari's obituary on ''[[Eurotrash (TV series)|Eurotrash]]'', it was transmitted with straight dubbing as a mark of respect (''Eurotrash''<noinclude>'</noinclude>s dubbing is normally exaggerated to emphasise the humour); it ended with a caption stating \"Lola Ferrari 1970\u20132000\"; an error given that her year of birth was actually 1963.

She had 22 enlargements, which is a [[Guinness Book of Records|Guinness world record]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Guinness World Records 2003|publisher=Bantam Books|location=New York|isbn=0-553-58636-X|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldrec2003folk}}</ref> The ''Guinness Book of Records'' (2003) indicates each of her breasts weighed {{convert|2.8|kg|lb}} and contained three litres of saline. \n\nShe wore a specially engineered [[brassiere]].

The breast implants themselves were reputed to be designed by an engineer who was involved with the design of the [[Boeing 747]].<ref name=c4/>\n\nIn interviews, she said about her surgeries \"All this stuff has been because I can't stand life. But it hasn't changed anything\" and \"I was frightened and I was ashamed; I wanted to change my face, my body, to transform myself. I wanted to die, really.\"<ref name=ob/>\n\n==Career==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}\nAfter the breast enlargements, she adopted the stage name \"Lolo\", from a French slang word for breasts, along with \"Ferrari\" as a last name, and made a few [[pornographic film]]s. Use of the Ferrari name (which she justified as it was her maternal grandfather's surname) led to lengthy trademark infringement court battles with the Italian [[Ferrari]] automobile company when she tried to market a line of underwear called Ferrari Underwear and a Lolo Ferrari doll. \n\nIn an effort to promote herself, she went with her husband to the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 1995. She won the \"European large breasts championship\" there, became a favorite of photographers, and entered the international limelight.\n\nShe appeared in the Belgian film ''[[Camping Cosmos]]'' by [[Jan Bucquoy]] and producer [[Francis De Smet]]. She caused a sensation at the 1996 [[Cannes Film Festival]] with the presentation of the movie during a remake of the boxing match in ''Camping Cosmos'' between the European champion and the former opponent of [[Muhammad Ali|Cassius Clay]] ([[Jean-Pierre Coopman]]).<ref>Interview with Jean-Pierre Coopman in the Flemish periodical ''Humo'' 3415, pp. 50\u201355, 14 February 2006.</ref>\n\nShe used her newly won publicity to obtain a regular role on the British [[Channel 4]] television show ''[[Eurotrash (TV series)|Eurotrash]]''. The media hype led to appearances on other European shows and work in cabaret shows doing a song and [[striptease]] act. Hoping to launch a pop music career, she recorded two singles, titled \"Airbag Generation\" and \"Set Me Free\", as well as two more singles, a [[Euro disco]] cabaret song called \"Dance Dance Dance\", and a cover of [[Thelma Houston]]'s Euro disco hit, \"[[Don't Leave Me This Way]]\". Neither of the latter two songs was given a commercial release.\n\n==Death==\nOn the morning of 5 March 2000, at the age of 37, Ferrari was found dead, of undetermined causes, by her husband at her home in [[Grasse]] in the [[Alpes-Maritimes]] d\u00e9partement on the [[French Riviera]].<ref name=bbc/> The original [[autopsy]] determined that she had died of an overdose of antidepressants and tranquilizers. She had been depressed and her death was ruled a suicide. Her parents suspected that her husband was involved, and a second autopsy approved two years later. This second autopsy found that mechanically-induced [[suffocation]] could not be ruled out. Her widower was suspected of causing her death, was arrested, and spent 13 months in prison.<ref name=c4/> After a second medical analysis, he was finally cleared of the charges in 2007.<ref name=20m>[http://www.20minutes.fr/article/140549/People-Le-mari-de-Lolo-Ferrari-blanchi.php \"Le mari de Lolo Ferrari blanchi\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130106215337/http://www.20minutes.fr/article/140549/People-Le-mari-de-Lolo-Ferrari-blanchi.php |date=6 January 2013 }}, 20minutes.fr, 20 February 2007.</ref>\n\nWhen Channel 4 broadcast Ferrari's obituary on ''[[Eurotrash (TV series)|Eurotrash]]'', it was transmitted with straight dubbing as a mark of respect (''Eurotrash''<noinclude>'</noinclude>s dubbing is normally exaggerated to emphasise the humour); it ended with a caption stating \"Lola Ferrari 1970\u20132000\"; an error given that her year of birth was actually 1963.
