The [[Allies of World War 2|Allied]] invasion had taken place, the [[Wehrmacht]] was defeated and was in retreat. Since May 1940 Allied [[Strategic bombing during World War 2|air raids]] had killed more than 500,000 civilians, and damaged or destroyed 90 percent of the buildings. On 12 June 1943, they had deliberately ignited a firestorm. By April 1945 further warfare appeared hopeless to many in the population.\n\nD\u00fcsseldorf had been a front-line city until the end of February 1945. By early March American troops \u2013 part of the [[83rd Infantry Division (United States)|83rd Infantry Division]] \u2013 had occupied the neighbouring city of [[Neuss]] and the left bank of the [[Rhine]] in D\u00fcsseldorf. [[Gauleiter]] of [[NSDAP]] and Reich Defense Commissioner [[Friedrich Karl Florian]] had ordered a [[scorched earth]] policy. All utilities and transportation were to be blown up including the Rhine bridge crossings, and the population of D\u00fcsseldorf was to be evacuated.   The city was under constant attack and was completely encircled by 10 April 1945.\n\n==The group led by Wiedenhofen==\n\nSince the 1930s a group of dissents had met in [[Gerresheim]], one of D\u00fcsseldorf's 43 boroughs.  Among them were {{ill|Aloys Odenthal|de}}, an architect,  and Theodor Winkens a baker and pastry chef, but who had been a clerk at police headquarters, and the lawyer Karl M\u00fcller  The group had been meeting regularly for conversation in [[Gerresheim]] since the 1930s.  Odenthal had firm Christian convictions. He had been interrogated twice by the [[Gestapo]] for his dissident statements, who threatened him with detention in a [[concentration camp]]. Winkens had been sacked as a clerk at the police headquarters in 1938 because he refused to divorce his wife, a Jew. \n\nAnother group of opponents of Nazism was led by the lawyer Karl August Wiedenhofen. The Wiedenhofen group included the engineer and businessman Josef Knab and [[master craftsman]] Ernst Klein, Josef Lauxtermann and Karl Kleppe. In the summer of 1944 Otto Goetsch joined the Wiedenhofen group.  Although Goetsch was a high official and member of the NSDAP, he was opposed to Nazism.\n\nIn 1943 the two groups began to meet  twice a month to plan.  Their common goal was the liberation of Germany from Nazism. No actions, however were actually carried out.\n\n==Development and implementation of ''Aktion Rheinland''==\n\nBecause of the worsening conditions in D\u00fcsseldorf the group decided to take action on 15 February 1945.  They began preparing for a bloodless surrender of the city to the advancing Allies. The first step in their plan was the elimination of the Nazi leadership of the police. The police themselves were believed to be the only trustworthy armed organization capable of implementing further action. The commander of the police, Franz J\u00fcrgens, had recently vehemently rejected the command of a battle group of police and [[Volkssturm]] and it was thought that he would be sympathetic to their objectives. They met with him only days before taking action on the 16th of April.  Theodor Andresen and Hermann Weill were also recruited at this time. \n\nThe action, now known as \"Aktion Rheinland\" was implemented on the 16th of April.  Odenthal, Wiedenhofen, Knab, M\u00fcller and Andresen met at police headquarters with J\u00fcrgens. Captain Gehrke, J\u00fcrgens deputy, was recruited to the cause. The D\u00fcsseldorf police chief, SS Brigade Commander August Korreng, was taken prisoner, and J\u00fcrgens took full command of the police. The Deputy Commissioner Goetsch and Lieutenant Colonel Juergens prepared a  pass authorizing Wiedenhofen as negotiator for the city of D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\nA short time later, the plan was betrayed, and Korreng was freed by a raiding party consisting of NSDAP Gauleiter Friedrich Karl Florian and [[Wehrmacht]] soldiers during the late afternoon. Part of the resistance group managed to escape, the others were detained at the police headquarters. Goetsch was among those able to escape and hid with Karl M\u00fcller. On 18 April, he surrendered to the Americans.\n\nOn the afternoon of 16 April, August Wiedenhofen and Aloys Odenthal reached the American lines near [[Mettmann]], and were able, after long negotiations, to surrender the city without further combat. An air raid by 800 bombers, which was scheduled for 17 April at 1:10&nbsp;am, was literally stopped at the last minute. On 17 April, the American [[97th Infantry Division]] marched into D\u00fcsseldorf, unopposed.<ref>[http://www.thehistoryherald.com/World-War-II/Aktion-Rheinland/ Aktion Rheinland \u2013 The History Herald]</ref> Odenthal and Wiedenhofen rode on the tanks and brought them to the police headquarters.\n\nDuring the night of 16/17 April, J\u00fcrgens, Andresen, Kleppe, Knab and Weill were convicted in state court proceedings for war treason and sentenced to death,<ref>[http://www.thehistoryherald.com/World-War-II/Aktion-Rheinland/ Aktion Rheinland \u2013 The History Herald].</ref> Of the captured conspirators, only Gehrke was acquitted.  The rest were executed in the yard of the vocational school F\u00e4rberstra\u00dfe [1].  They were immediately buried but on the first of June 1945 their bodies were  exhumed and autopsied.  The autopsies determined that Knab and Andresen had suffered serious abuse. Former SS Brigade commander Korreng committed suicide on 7 June 1945.\n\n==After the war==\n\nThe death sentences of the state court proceedings were repeatedly subject to [[judicial review]] and ultimately found by the Federal Court as lawful. Only in 1999 were they cancelled because of the law abolishing Nazi judgements.<ref>[http://www.thehistoryherald.com/World-War-II/Aktion-Rheinland/ Aktion Rheinland \u2013 The History Herald]</ref>\n\nThe resistance fighters involved received numerous honours. The executed were buried in graves of honour at the D\u00fcsseldorf North Cemetery, the Gerresheimer Forest Cemetery and the Stoffeler Cemetery, memorials were built and named streets and squares after them. Aloys Odenthal received honorary citizenship of D\u00fcsseldorf in 1985.\n\nOn 17 April 2011, the ''{{ill|Weg der Befreiung|de}}'' (\"Path of Liberation\") was inaugurated by Mayor Dirk Elbers, consisting of six pillars, which are installed at points marking the journey taken by Odenthal and Wiedenhofen from the city police headquarters to reach US forces near Mettman.\n\n==See also==\n* [[German Resistance]]\n* [[Ruhr Pocket]]\n* {{ill|Weg der Befreiung|de}} \u2013 German Wikipedia\n* [[:de:Aktion Rheinland|Aktion Rheinland]] \u2013 German Wikipedia\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:History of D\u00fcsseldorf]]\n[[Category:German resistance to Nazism]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1945]]\n[[Category:1945 in Germany]]\n[[Category:Western European Campaign (1944\u20131945)]]\n[[Category:20th century in North Rhine-Westphalia]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2016}}\n{{refimprove|date=June 2016}}\n'''Aktion Rheinland''' (German for ''Operation Rhineland'') was an operation carried out by the Anti-[[Nazi]] [[German Resistance|resistance]] group in [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] led by [[:de:Karl August Wiedenhofen|Karl August Wiedenhofen]].

Among them were [[:de:Aloys Odenthal|Aloys Odenthal]], an architect,  and Theodor Winkens a baker and pastry chef, but who had been a clerk at police headquarters, and the lawyer Karl M\u00fcller  The group had been meeting regularly for conversation in [[Gerresheim]] since the 1930s.  Odenthal had firm Christian convictions. He had been interrogated twice by the [[Gestapo]] for his dissident statements, who threatened him with detention in a [[concentration camp]]. Winkens had been sacked as a clerk at the police headquarters in 1938 because he refused to divorce his wife, a Jew. \n\nAnother group of opponents of Nazism was led by the lawyer Karl August Wiedenhofen. The Wiedenhofen group included the engineer and businessman Josef Knab and [[master craftsman]] Ernst Klein, Josef Lauxtermann and Karl Kleppe. In the summer of 1944 Otto Goetsch joined the Wiedenhofen group.  Although Goetsch was a high official and member of the NSDAP, he was opposed to Nazism.\n\nIn 1943 the two groups began to meet  twice a month to plan.  Their common goal was the liberation of Germany from Nazism. No actions, however were actually carried out.\n\n==Development and implementation of ''Aktion Rheinland''==\n\nBecause of the worsening conditions in D\u00fcsseldorf the group decided to take action on 15 February 1945.  They began preparing for a bloodless surrender of the city to the advancing Allies. The first step in their plan was the elimination of the Nazi leadership of the police. The police themselves were believed to be the only trustworthy armed organization capable of implementing further action. The commander of the police, Franz J\u00fcrgens, had recently vehemently rejected the command of a battle group of police and [[Volkssturm]] and it was thought that he would be sympathetic to their objectives. They met with him only days before taking action on the 16th of April.  Theodor Andresen and Hermann Weill were also recruited at this time. \n\nThe action, now known as \"Aktion Rheinland\" was implemented on the 16th of April.  Odenthal, Wiedenhofen, Knab, M\u00fcller and Andresen met at police headquarters with J\u00fcrgens. Captain Gehrke, J\u00fcrgens deputy, was recruited to the cause. The D\u00fcsseldorf police chief, SS Brigade Commander August Korreng, was taken prisoner, and J\u00fcrgens took full command of the police. The Deputy Commissioner Goetsch and Lieutenant Colonel Juergens prepared a  pass authorizing Wiedenhofen as negotiator for the city of D\u00fcsseldorf.\n\nA short time later, the plan was betrayed, and Korreng was freed by a raiding party consisting of NSDAP Gauleiter Friedrich Karl Florian and [[Wehrmacht]] soldiers during the late afternoon. Part of the resistance group managed to escape, the others were detained at the police headquarters. Goetsch was among those able to escape and hid with Karl M\u00fcller. On 18 April, he surrendered to the Americans.\n\nOn the afternoon of 16 April, August Wiedenhofen and Aloys Odenthal reached the American lines near [[Mettmann]], and were able, after long negotiations, to surrender the city without further combat. An air raid by 800 bombers, which was scheduled for 17 April at 1:10&nbsp;am, was literally stopped at the last minute. On 17 April, the American [[97th Infantry Division]] marched into D\u00fcsseldorf, unopposed.<ref>[http://www.thehistoryherald.com/World-War-II/Aktion-Rheinland/ Aktion Rheinland \u2013 The History Herald]</ref> Odenthal and Wiedenhofen rode on the tanks and brought them to the police headquarters.\n\nDuring the night of 16/17 April, J\u00fcrgens, Andresen, Kleppe, Knab and Weill were convicted in state court proceedings for war treason and sentenced to death,<ref>[http://www.thehistoryherald.com/World-War-II/Aktion-Rheinland/ Aktion Rheinland \u2013 The History Herald].</ref> Of the captured conspirators, only Gehrke was acquitted.  The rest were executed in the yard of the vocational school F\u00e4rberstra\u00dfe [1].  They were immediately buried but on the first of June 1945 their bodies were  exhumed and autopsied.  The autopsies determined that Knab and Andresen had suffered serious abuse. Former SS Brigade commander Korreng committed suicide on 7 June 1945.\n\n==After the war==\n\nThe death sentences of the state court proceedings were repeatedly subject to [[judicial review]] and ultimately found by the Federal Court as lawful. Only in 1999 were they cancelled because of the law abolishing Nazi judgements.<ref>[http://www.thehistoryherald.com/World-War-II/Aktion-Rheinland/ Aktion Rheinland \u2013 The History Herald]</ref>\n\nThe resistance fighters involved received numerous honours. The executed were buried in graves of honour at the D\u00fcsseldorf North Cemetery, the Gerresheimer Forest Cemetery and the Stoffeler Cemetery, memorials were built and named streets and squares after them. Aloys Odenthal received honorary citizenship of D\u00fcsseldorf in 1985.\n\nOn 17 April 2011, the ''[[:de:Weg der Befreiung|Weg der Befreiung]]'' (\"Path of Liberation\") was inaugurated by Mayor Dirk Elbers, consisting of six pillars, which are installed at points marking the journey taken by Odenthal and Wiedenhofen from the city police headquarters to reach US forces near Mettman.\n\n==See also==\n*[[German Resistance]]\n*[[Ruhr Pocket]]\n*[[:de:Weg der Befreiung|Weg der Befreiung]] \u2013 German Wikipedia\n*[[:de:Aktion Rheinland|Aktion Rheinland]] \u2013 German Wikipedia\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:History of D\u00fcsseldorf]]\n[[Category:German resistance to Nazism]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1945]]\n[[Category:1945 in Germany]]\n[[Category:Western European Campaign (1944\u20131945)]]\n[[Category:20th century in North Rhine-Westphalia]]\n", "name_user": "2x2leax", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aktion_Rheinland"}

Its members are commonly known as the '''sac fungi''' or '''ascomycetes'''. It is the largest phylum of Fungi, with over 64,000 [[species]].<ref>Kirk ''et al''., p. 55.</ref> The defining feature of this fungal group is the \"[[ascus]]\" (from [[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|\u1f00\u03c3\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2}} (''askos''), meaning \"sac\" or \"wineskin\"), a microscopic [[Sexual reproduction|sexual structure]] in which nonmotile [[spore]]s, called [[ascospore]]s, are formed. However, some species of the Ascomycota are [[Teleomorph, anamorph and holomorph|asexual]], meaning that they do not have a sexual cycle and thus do not form asci or ascospores.  Familiar examples of sac fungi include [[Morchella|morel]]s, [[truffle]]s, [[yeast#Beer|brewer's yeast]] and [[baker's yeast]], [[Xylaria|dead man's fingers]], and [[Pezizaceae|cup fungi]]. The fungal [[symbiosis|symbiont]]s in the majority of [[lichen]]s (loosely termed \"ascolichens\") such as ''[[Cladonia]]'' belong to the Ascomycota.\n\nAscomycota is a [[monophyly|monophyletic]] group (it contains all descendants of one common ancestor). Previously placed in the [[Deuteromycota]] along with asexual species from other fungal taxa, asexual (or [[Teleomorph, anamorph and holomorph|anamorph]]ic) ascomycetes are now identified and classified based on [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] or [[physiological]] similarities to ascus-bearing [[Taxon|taxa]], and by [[phylogenetic]] analyses of [[DNA]] sequences.<ref name=Lutzoni_2004>{{cite journal|author=Lutzoni F|title= Assembling the fungal tree of life: progress, classification, and evolution of subcellular traits|journal=American Journal of Botany|year=2004|pages=1446\u201380|volume=91|doi=10.3732/ajb.91.10.1446|issue=10|pmid=21652303|display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref name=James_2006>{{cite journal|author=James TY|title=Reconstructing the early evolution of Fungi using a six-gene phylogeny|journal=Nature|year=2006|pages=818\u201322|volume=443|pmid=17051209|doi=10.1038/nature05110|issue=7113|display-authors=etal|bibcode=2006Natur.443..818J|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/185458f908ccf9f23e4308506aee2ffc4a129687}}</ref>\n\nThe ascomycetes are of particular use to humans as sources of medicinally important compounds, such as [[antibacterial|antibiotics]], for [[fermentation|fermenting]] bread, alcoholic beverages and cheese. ''[[Penicillium]]'' species on cheeses and those producing antibiotics for treating bacterial [[infectious disease]]s are examples of ascomycetes.\n\nMany ascomycetes are [[pathogen]]s, both of animals, including humans, and of plants. Examples of ascomycetes that can cause infections in humans include ''[[Candida albicans]]'', ''[[Aspergillus niger]]'' and several tens of species that cause [[Dermatophytosis|skin infections]]. The many [[plant pathology|plant-pathogenic]] ascomycetes include [[apple scab]], [[Magnaporthe grisea|rice blast]], the [[Ergot|ergot fungi]], [[Dibotryon morbosum|black knot]], and the [[powdery mildew]]s.\nSeveral species of ascomycetes are biological [[model organism]]s in laboratory research. Most famously, ''[[Neurospora crassa]]'', several species of [[yeast]]s, and ''[[Aspergillus]]'' species are used in many [[genetics]] and [[cell biology]] studies.\n\n== Asexual reproduction in ascomycetes and their characteristics ==\n'''Ascomycetes:'''\n\nAscomycetes are 'spore shooters'. They are fungi which produce microscopic spores inside special, elongated cells or sacs, known as 'asci', which give the group its name.\n\n'''Asexual reproduction:'''\n\nAsexual reproduction is the dominant form of propagation in the Ascomycota, and is responsible for the rapid spread of these fungi into new areas. Asexual reproduction of ascomycetes is very diverse from both structural and functional points of view. The most important and general is production of conidia, but chlamydospores are also frequently produced. Furthermore, Ascomycota also reproduce asexually through budding.\n\n#'''Conidia formation:'''\n\nAsexual reproduction may occur through vegetative reproductive spores, the conidia. The asexual, non-motile haploid spores of a fungus, which are named after the Greek word for dust (conia), are hence also known as conidiospores and mitospores. The '''[[conidiospores]]''' commonly contain one nucleus and are products of mitotic cell divisions and thus are sometimes call '''mitospores''', which are genetically identical to the mycelium from which they originate. They are typically formed at the ends of specialized hyphae, the conidiophores. Depending on the species they may be dispersed by wind or water, or by animals. Conidiophores may simply branch off from the mycelia or they may be formed in fruiting bodies.\n[[File:Conidia Formation.png|thumb|424x424px]]\nThe hypha that creates the sporing (conidiating) tip can be very similar to the normal hyphal tip, or it can be differentiated. The most common differentiation is the formation of a bottle shaped cell called a '''[[phialide]],''' from which the spores are produced. Not all of these asexual structures are a single hypha. In some groups, the conidiophores (the structures that bear the conidia) are aggregated to form a thick structure.\n\nE.g. In the order ''Moniliales,'' all of them are single hyphae with the exception of the aggregations, termed as coremia or synnema. These produce structures rather like corn-stokes, with many conidia being produced in a mass from the aggregated conidiophores.\n\nThe diverse conidia and conidiophores sometimes develop in asexual sporocarps with different characteristics (e.g. acervulus, pycnidium, sporodochium). Some species of ''Ascomycetes'' form their structures within plant tissue, either as parasite or saprophytes. These fungi have evolved more complex asexual sporing structures, probably influenced by the cultural conditions of plant tissue as a substrate. These structures are called the '''sporodochium'''. This is a cushion of conidiophores created from a pseudoparenchymatous [[stroma (mycology)|stroma]] in plant tissue. The '''[[pycnidium]]''' is a globose to flask-shaped parenchymatous structure, lined on its inner wall with conidiophores. The '''[[acervulus]]''' is a flat saucer shaped bed of conidiophores produced under a plant cuticle, which eventually erupt through the cuticle for dispersal.\n[[File:Conidia Formation Image.png|thumb|333x333px]]\n'''2) Budding:'''\n\nAsexual reproduction process in ascomycetes also involves the budding which we clearly observe in '''yeast'''. This is termed a \"blastic process\". It involves the blowing out or blebbing of the hyphal tip wall. The blastic process can involve all wall layers, or there can be a new cell wall synthesized which is extruded from within the old wall.\n[[File:Budding.png|centre|thumb|337x337px]]\nThe initial events of budding can be seen as the development of a ring of chitin around the point where the bud is about to appear. This reinforces and stabilizes the cell wall. Enzymatic activity and turgor pressure act to weaken and extrude the cell wall. New cell wall material is incorporated during this phase. Cell contents are forced into the progeny cell, and as the final phase of mitosis ends a cell plate, the point at which a new cell wall will grow inwards from, forms.\n\n===Characteristics of ascomycetes===\n\n* Ascomycota are morphologically diverse. The group includes organisms from unicellular yeasts to complex cup fungi.\n* There are 2000 identified genera and 30,000 species of Ascomycota.\n* The unifying characteristic among these diverse groups is the presence of a reproductive structure known as the '''ascus''', though in some cases it has a reduced role in the life cycle.\n* Many ascomycetes are of commercial importance. Some play a beneficial role, such as the yeasts used in baking, brewing, and wine fermentation, plus truffles and morels, which are held as gourmet delicacies.\n* Many of them cause tree diseases, such as Dutch elm disease and apple blights.\n* Some of the plant pathogenic ascomycetes are apple scab, rice blast, the ergot fungi, black knot, and the powdery mildews.\n* The yeasts are used to produce alcoholic beverages and breads. The mold ''Penicillium'' is used to produce the antibiotic penicillin.\n* Almost half of all members of the phylum Ascomycota form '''symbiotic''' associations with algae to form lichens.\n* Others, such as morels (a highly prized edible fungi), form important '''mycorrhizal''' relationships with plants, thereby providing enhanced water and nutrient uptake and, in some cases, protection from insects.\n* Almost all ascomycetes are terrestrial or parasitic.  However, a few have adapted to marine or freshwater environments.\n* The cell walls of the hyphae are variably composed of '''chitin''' and \u03b2-glucans, just as in Basidiomycota.  However, these fibers are set in a matrix of glycoprotein containing the sugars galactose and mannose.\n* The mycelium of ascomycetes is usually made up of '''septate hyphae'''.  However, there is not necessarily any fixed number of nuclei in each of the divisions.\n* The septal walls have septal pores which provide cytoplasmic continuity throughout the individual hyphae.  Under appropriate conditions, nuclei may also migrate between septal compartments through the septal pores.\n* A unique character of the Ascomycota (but not present in all ascomycetes) is the presence of '''Woronin bodies''' on each side of the septa separating the hyphal segments which control the septal pores.  If an adjoining hypha is ruptured, the Woronin bodies block the pores to prevent loss of cytoplasm into the ruptured compartment.  The Woronin bodies are spherical, hexagonal, or rectangular membrane bound structures with a crystalline protein matrix.\n\n== Modern classification ==\nThere are three [[subphylum|subphyla]] that are described and accepted:\n* The ''[[Pezizomycotina]]'' are the largest subphylum and contains all ascomycetes that produce [[ascocarp]]s (fruiting bodies), except for one genus, ''[[Neolecta]]'', in the [[Taphrinomycotina]]. It is roughly equivalent to the previous taxon, ''Euascomycetes''. The Pezizomycotina includes most macroscopic \"ascos\" such as [[truffle]]s, [[ergot]], ascolichens, [[Pezizaceae|cup fungi]] ([[discomycetes]]), [[Sordariomycetes|pyrenomycetes]], [[Gyromitra esculenta|lorchels]], and [[Ophiocordyceps sinensis|caterpillar fungus]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.herbarium.usu.edu/fungi/FunFacts/Caterpillar.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312153703/http://www.herbarium.usu.edu/fungi/FunFacts/Caterpillar.htm|title=Caterpillar Fungus|archive-date=2007-03-12}}</ref> It also contains microscopic fungi such as [[powdery mildew]]s, [[Trichophyton|dermatophytic]] fungi, and [[Laboulbeniales]].\n* The ''[[Saccharomycotina]]'' comprise most of the \"true\" yeasts, such as [[baker's yeast]] and ''[[Candida (genus)|Candida]]'', which are single-celled (unicellular) fungi, which reproduce vegetatively by budding. Most of these species were previously classified in a taxon called ''Hemiascomycetes''.\n* The ''[[Taphrinomycotina]]'' include a disparate and [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] group within the Ascomycota that was recognized following molecular ([[DNA]]) analyses. The taxon was originally named ''[[Archiascomycetes]]'' (or ''[[Archaeascomycetes]]''). It includes hyphal fungi (''[[Neolecta]]'', ''[[Taphrina]]'', ''[[Archaeorhizomyces]]''), fission yeasts (''[[Schizosaccharomyces]]''), and the mammalian lung parasite ''[[Pneumocystis]]''.\n\n== Outdated taxon names ==\nSeveral outdated taxon names\u2014based on morphological features\u2014are still occasionally used for species of the Ascomycota. These include the following sexual ([[Teleomorph, anamorph and holomorph|teleomorph]]ic) groups, defined by the structures of their sexual [[Sporocarp (fungi)|fruiting bodies]]: the [[Discomycetes]], which included all species forming [[ascocarp|apothecia]]; the [[Pyrenomycetes]], which included all sac fungi that formed [[ascocarp|perithecia]] or [[ascocarp|pseudothecia]], or any structure resembling these morphological structures; and the Plectomycetes, which included those species that form [[ascocarp|cleistothecia]]. [[Hemiascomycetes]] included the yeasts and yeast-like fungi that have now been placed into the [[Saccharomycotina]] or [[Taphrinomycotina]], while the [[Euascomycetes]] included the remaining species of the Ascomycota, which are now in the [[Pezizomycotina]], and the [[Neolecta]], which are in the Taphrinomycotina.\n\nSome ascomycetes do not reproduce sexually or are not known to produce [[ascus|asci]] and are therefore [[Teleomorph, anamorph and holomorph|anamorph]]ic species. Those anamorphs that produce [[Conidium|conidia]] (mitospores) were previously described as [[mitosporic Ascomycota]]. Some taxonomists placed this group into a separate [[form classification|artificial phylum]], the [[Deuteromycota]] (or \"Fungi Imperfecti\"). Where recent [[Molecular phylogenetics|molecular analyses]] have identified close relationships with ascus-bearing taxa, anamorphic species have been grouped into the Ascomycota, despite the absence of the defining ascus. Sexual and asexual isolates of the same species commonly carry different [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial]] species names, as, for example, ''[[Aspergillus nidulans]]'' and ''Emericella nidulans'', for asexual and sexual isolates, respectively, of the same species.\n\nSpecies of the Deuteromycota were classified as Coelomycetes if they produced their conidia in minute flask- or saucer-shaped conidiomata, known technically as ''pycnidia'' and ''acervuli''.<ref>{{harvnb|Alexopoulos|Mims|Blackwell|1996|p=233}}</ref> The [[Hyphomycetes]] were those species where the [[conidiophore]]s (''i.e.'', the hyphal structures that carry conidia-forming cells at the end) are free or loosely organized. They are mostly isolated but sometimes also appear as bundles of cells aligned in parallel (described as ''synnematal'') or as cushion-shaped masses (described as ''sporodochial'').<ref>{{harvnb|Alexopoulos|Mims|Blackwell|1996|pp=218\u2013222}}</ref>\n\n== Morphology ==\n[[File:Cordyceps ignota.JPG|thumb|right| A member of the genus ''[[Cordyceps]]'' which is parasitic on arthropods. Note the elongated stromata. Species unknown, perhaps ''Cordyceps ignota''.]]\n\nMost species grow as filamentous, microscopic structures called [[hypha]]e or as budding single cells (yeasts). Many [[Anastomosis|interconnected]] hyphae form a [[thallus]] usually referred to as the [[mycelium]], which\u2014when visible to the naked eye (macroscopic)\u2014is commonly called [[mold]]. During sexual reproduction, many Ascomycota typically produce large numbers of [[ascus|asci]]. The ascus is often contained in a multicellular, occasionally readily visible fruiting structure, the [[ascocarp]] (also called an ''ascoma''). Ascocarps come in a very large variety of shapes: cup-shaped, club-shaped, potato-like, spongy, seed-like, oozing and pimple-like, coral-like, nit-like, golf-ball-shaped, perforated tennis ball-like, cushion-shaped, plated and feathered in miniature ([[Laboulbeniales]]), microscopic classic Greek shield-shaped, stalked or sessile. They can appear solitary or clustered. Their texture can likewise be very variable, including fleshy, like charcoal (carbonaceous), leathery, rubbery, gelatinous, slimy, powdery, or cob-web-like. Ascocarps come in multiple colors such as red, orange, yellow, brown, black, or, more rarely, green or blue. Some ascomyceous fungi, such as ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'', grow as single-celled yeasts, which\u2014during sexual reproduction\u2014develop into an ascus, and do not form fruiting bodies.\n[[File:Xylaria hypoxylon.jpg|thumb|left|The \"candlesnuff fungus\" in its asexual state, ''[[Xylaria hypoxylon]]'']]\n\nIn [[lichen]]ized species, the thallus of the fungus defines the shape of the [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] colony. Some [[Phenotypic switching|dimorphic]] species, such as ''[[Candida albicans]]'', can switch between growth as single cells and as filamentous, multicellular hyphae. Other species are [[pleomorphism (microbiology)|pleomorphic]], exhibiting asexual (anamorphic) as well as a sexual (teleomorphic) growth forms.\n\nExcept for lichens, the non-reproductive (vegetative) mycelium of most ascomycetes is usually inconspicuous because it is commonly embedded in the substrate, such as soil, or grows on or inside a living host, and only the ascoma may be seen when fruiting. [[Pigment]]ation, such as [[melanin]] in hyphal walls, along with prolific growth on surfaces can result in visible mold colonies; examples include ''[[Cladosporium]]'' species, which form black spots on bathroom caulking and other moist areas. Many ascomycetes cause food spoilage, and, therefore, the pellicles or moldy layers that develop on jams, juices, and other foods are the mycelia of these species or occasionally [[Mucoromycotina]] and almost never [[Basidiomycota]]. [[Sooty mold]]s that develop on plants, especially in the tropics are the thalli of many species.{{Clarify|many ascomycetous species?|date=September 2009}}\n[[File:Smardz-Morchella-Ejdzej-2006.jpg|thumb|right|179px|The ascocarp of a [[Morchella|morel]] contains numerous apothecia.]]\n\nLarge masses of yeast cells, asci or ascus-like cells, or conidia can also form macroscopic structures. For example. ''[[Pneumocystis]]'' species can colonize lung cavities (visible in x-rays), causing a form of [[pneumonia]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors= Krajicek BJ, Thomas CF Jr, Limper AH |year=2009 |title=''Pneumocystis'' pneumonia: current concepts in pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment |journal=Clinics in Chest Medicine |volume=30|issue=2|pages=265\u201389|pmid=19375633 |doi= 10.1016/j.ccm.2009.02.005 }}</ref> Asci of ''[[Ascosphaera]]'' fill [[honey bee]] [[larva]]e and [[pupa]]e causing mummification with a chalk-like appearance, hence the name \"chalkbrood\".<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors= James RR, Skinner JS |year=2005|title=PCR diagnostic methods for Ascosphaera infections in bees |journal=Journal of Invertebrate Pathology|volume=90|issue=2|pages=98\u2013103|pmid=16214164 |doi= 10.1016/j.jip.2005.08.004 |url=https://naldc-legacy.nal.usda.gov/naldc/download.xhtml?id=6101&content=PDF}}</ref> Yeasts for small colonies [[in vitro]] and [[in vivo]], and excessive growth of ''[[Candida (genus)|Candida]]'' species in the mouth or vagina causes \"thrush\", a form of [[candidiasis]].\n\nThe cell walls of the ascomycetes almost always contain [[chitin]] and [[Beta-glucan|\u03b2-glucans]], and divisions within the hyphae, called \"[[septum#In mycology|septa]]\", are the internal boundaries of individual cells (or compartments). The cell wall and septa give stability and rigidity to the hyphae and may prevent loss of [[cytoplasm]] in case of local damage to cell wall and [[cell membrane]]. The septa commonly have a small opening in the center, which functions as a [[cytoplasm]]ic connection between adjacent cells, also sometimes allowing cell-to-cell movement of [[Cell nucleus|nuclei]] within a hypha. Vegetative hyphae of most ascomycetes contain only one nucleus per cell (''[[uninucleate]]'' hyphae), but [[multinucleate]] cells\u2014especially in the apical regions of growing hyphae\u2014can also be present.\n\n== Metabolism ==\nIn common with other fungal phyla, the Ascomycota are [[Heterotrophy|heterotrophic]] organisms that require [[organic compound]]s as energy sources. These are obtained by feeding on a variety of organic substrates including dead matter, foodstuffs, or as [[symbiosis|symbiont]]s in or on other living organisms. To obtain these nutrients from their surroundings, ascomycetous fungi secrete powerful [[digestive enzyme]]s that break down organic substances into smaller molecules, which are then taken up into the cell. Many species live on dead plant material such as leaves, twigs, or logs. Several species colonize plants, animals, or other fungi as [[parasite]]s or [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic symbionts]] and derive all their metabolic energy in form of nutrients from the tissues of their hosts.\n\nOwing to their long evolutionary history, the Ascomycota have evolved the capacity to break down almost every organic substance. Unlike most organisms, they are able to use their own [[enzyme]]s to digest plant [[biopolymer]]s such as [[cellulose]] or [[lignin]]. [[Collagen]], an abundant structural protein in animals, and [[keratin]]\u2014a protein that forms hair and nails\u2014, can also serve as food sources. Unusual examples include ''[[Aureobasidium pullulans]]'', which feeds on wall paint, and the kerosene fungus ''[[Amorphotheca resinae]]'', which feeds on aircraft fuel (causing occasional problems for the airline industry), and may sometimes block fuel pipes.<ref name=Hendey>{{cite journal | last1 = Hendey | first1 = N.

Many Ascomycota engage in symbiotic relationships such as in lichens\u2014symbiotic associations with green [[algae]] or [[cyanobacteria]]\u2014in which the fungal symbiont directly obtains products of [[photosynthesis]]. In common with many basidiomycetes and [[Glomeromycota]], some ascomycetes form symbioses with plants by colonizing the roots to form [[mycorrhiza]]l associations.

It occurs through vegetative reproductive spores, the [[conidium|conidia]]. The conidiospores commonly contain one nucleus and are products of [[mitosis|mitotic]] cell divisions and thus are sometimes called mitospores, which are genetically identical to the mycelium from which they originate. They are typically formed at the ends of specialized [[hypha]]e, the ''conidiophores''. Depending on the species they may be [[Seed dispersal|dispersed]] by wind or water, or by animals.\n\n==== Asexual spores ====\nDifferent types of asexual spores can be identified by colour, shape, and how they are released as individual spores. Spore types can be used as taxonomic characters in the classification within the Ascomycota. The most frequent types are the single-celled spores, which are designated ''amerospores''. If the spore is divided into two by a cross-wall ([[septum#In mycology|septum]]), it is called a ''didymospore''.\n{| align=\"right\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"\n|[[File:Trichoderma aggressivum.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|Conidiospores of ''Trichoderma aggressivum'', Diameter approx. 3\u00b5m]]\n|-\n|[[File:Aspergillus.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Conidiophores of molds of the genus ''Aspergillus'', conidiogenesis is blastic-phialidic]]\n|-\n|[[File:Trichoderma harzianum.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Conidiophores of ''[[Trichoderma harzianum]]'', conidiogenesis is blastic-phialidic]]\n|-\n|[[File:Trichoderma fertile.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Conidiophores of ''Trichoderma fertile'' with vase-shaped phialides and newly formed conidia on their ends (bright points)]]\n|}\n\nWhen there are two or more cross-walls, the classification depends on spore shape. If the septae are ''transversal'', like the rungs of a ladder, it is a ''phragmospore'', and if they possess a net-like structure it is a ''dictyospore''. In ''staurospores'' ray-like arms radiate from a central body; in others (''helicospores'') the entire spore is wound up in a spiral like a spring. Very long worm-like spores with a length-to-diameter ratio of more than 15:1, are called ''scolecospores''.\n\n==== Conidiogenesis and dehiscence ====\nImportant characteristics of the anamorphs of the Ascomycota are ''conidiogenesis'', which includes spore formation and dehiscence (separation from the parent structure). Conidiogenesis corresponds to [[Embryology]] in animals and plants and can be divided into two fundamental forms of development: ''blastic'' conidiogenesis, where the spore is already evident before it separates from the conidiogenic hypha, and ''thallic'' conidiogenesis, during which a cross-wall forms and the newly created cell develops into a spore. The spores may or may not be generated in a large-scale specialized structure that helps to spread them.\n\nThese two basic types can be further classified as follows:\n* ''blastic-acropetal'' (repeated budding at the tip of the conidiogenic hypha, so that a chain of spores is formed with the youngest spores at the tip),\n* ''blastic-synchronous'' (simultaneous spore formation from a central cell, sometimes with secondary acropetal chains forming from the initial spores),\n* ''blastic-sympodial'' (repeated sideways spore formation from behind the leading spore, so that the oldest spore is at the main tip),\n* ''blastic-annellidic'' (each spore separates and leaves a ring-shaped scar inside the scar left by the previous spore),\n* ''blastic-phialidic'' (the spores arise and are ejected from the open ends of special conidiogenic cells called [[phialide]]s, which remain constant in length),\n* ''basauxic'' (where a chain of conidia, in successively younger stages of development, is emitted from the mother cell),\n* ''blastic-retrogressive'' (spores separate by formation of crosswalls near the tip of the conidiogenic hypha, which thus becomes progressively shorter),\n* ''thallic-arthric'' (double cell walls split the conidiogenic hypha into cells that develop into short, cylindrical spores called ''arthroconidia''; sometimes every second cell dies off, leaving the arthroconidia free),\n* ''thallic-solitary'' (a large bulging cell separates from the conidiogenic hypha, forms internal walls, and develops to a ''phragmospore'').\n\nSometimes the conidia are produced in structures visible to the naked eye, which help to distribute the spores. These structures are called \"conidiomata\" (singular: [[Conidium|conidioma]]), and may take the form of ''[[Pycnidium|pycnidia]]'' (which are flask-shaped and arise in the fungal tissue) or ''acervuli'' (which are cushion-shaped and arise in host tissue).<ref>See the [[Conidium]] article for full details.</ref>\n\nDehiscence happens in two ways. In ''schizolytic'' dehiscence, a double-dividing wall with a central lamella (layer) forms between the cells; the central layer then breaks down thereby releasing the spores. In ''rhexolytic'' dehiscence, the cell wall that joins the spores on the outside degenerates and releases the conidia.\n\n=== Heterokaryosis and parasexuality ===\nSeveral Ascomycota species are not known to have a sexual cycle. Such asexual species may be able to undergo genetic recombination between individuals by processes involving ''heterokaryosis'' and ''parasexual'' events.\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br.fcgi?book=mmed&part=A3958&rendertype=figure&id=A3958 Parasexuality] refers to the process of heterokaryosis, caused by merging of two hyphae belonging to different individuals, by a process called ''[[anastomosis]]'', followed by a series of events resulting in genetically different [[Cell nucleus|cell nuclei]] in the [[mycelium]].<ref>{{harvnb|Deacon|2005|pp=164\u20136}}</ref>\nThe merging of nuclei is not followed by [[meiosis|meiotic events]], such as [[gamete]] formation and results in an increased number of [[chromosome]]s per nuclei. ''[[Mitotic crossover]]'' may enable [[genetic recombination|recombination]], i.e., an exchange of genetic material between [[homologous chromosome]]s. The chromosome number may then be restored to its [[ploidy#Haploid and monoploid|haploid]] state by [[Telophase|nuclear division]], with each daughter nuclei being genetically different from the original parent nuclei.<ref>{{harvnb|Deacon|2005|pp=167\u20138}}</ref> Alternatively, nuclei may lose some chromosomes, resulting in [[aneuploid]] cells.  ''Candida albicans'' (class Saccharomycetes) is an example of a fungus that has a parasexual cycle (see [[Candida albicans]] and [[Parasexual cycle]]).\n\n=== Sexual reproduction ===\n[[File:Hypocrea virens.jpg|thumb|right|115px|Ascus of ''Hypocrea virens'' with eight two-celled Ascospores]]\nSexual reproduction in the Ascomycota leads to the formation of the ''ascus'', the structure that defines this fungal group and distinguishes it from other fungal phyla. The ascus is a tube-shaped vessel, a ''meiosporangium'', which contains the sexual spores produced by [[meiosis]] and which are called ''ascospores''.\n\nApart from a few exceptions, such as ''[[Candida albicans]]'', most ascomycetes are [[ploidy#Haploid and monoploid|haploid]], i.e., they contain one set of [[chromosome]]s per nucleus. During sexual reproduction there is a [[ploidy#Diploid|diploid]] phase, which commonly is very short, and meiosis restores the haploid state.  The sexual cycle of one well-studied representative species of Ascomycota is described in greater detail in ''[[Neurospora crassa]]''. Also, the adaptive basis for the maintenance of sexual reproduction in the Ascomycota  [[fungus|fungi]] was reviewed by Wallen and Perlin.<ref name=\"pmid29619017\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Wallen RM, Perlin MH |title=An Overview of the Function and Maintenance of Sexual Reproduction in Dikaryotic Fungi |journal=Front Microbiol |volume=9 |issue= |pages=503 |date=2018 |pmid=29619017 |doi=10.3389/fmicb.2018.00503 |url=|pmc=5871698 }}</ref>  They concluded that the most plausible reason for the maintenance of this capability is the benefit of [[DNA repair|repairing DNA damage]] by using  [[homologous recombination|recombination]] that occurs during [[meiosis]].<ref name=\"pmid29619017\" />  DNA damage can be caused by a variety of stresses such as nutrient limitation.\n\n==== Formation of sexual spores ====\nThe sexual part of the life cycle commences when two hyphal structures [[Mating|mate]]. In the case of ''[[homothallic]]'' species, mating is enabled between hyphae of the same fungal [[cloning|clone]], whereas in ''[[heterothallic]]'' species, the two hyphae must originate from fungal clones that differ genetically, i.e., those that are of a different [[mating type]]. Mating types are typical of the fungi and correspond roughly to the sexes in plants and animals; however one species may have more than two mating types, resulting in sometimes complex [[Allorecognition#Allorecognition phenomena|vegetative incompatibility]] systems. The adaptive function of mating type is discussed in ''[[Neurospora crassa]]''.\n\n[[Gametangia]] are sexual structures formed from hyphae, and are the generative cells. A very fine hypha, called [[:wikt:trichogyne|trichogyne]] emerges from one gametangium, the ''ascogonium'', and merges with a gametangium (the ''antheridium'') of the other fungal isolate. The nuclei in the antheridium then migrate into the ascogonium, and [[plasmogamy]]\u2014the mixing of the [[cytoplasm]]\u2014occurs. Unlike in animals and plants, plasmogamy is not immediately followed by the merging of the nuclei (called ''[[karyogamy]]''). Instead, the nuclei from the two hyphae form pairs, initiating the ''dikaryophase'' of the sexual cycle, during which time the pairs of nuclei synchronously divide. Fusion of the paired nuclei leads to mixing of the genetic material and [[genetic recombination|recombination]] and is followed by [[meiosis]]. A similar sexual cycle is present in the [[red algae]] (Rhodophyta). A discarded hypothesis held that a second karyogamy event occurred in the ascogonium prior to ascogeny, resulting in a tetraploid nucleus which divided into four diploid nuclei by meiosis and then into eight haploid nuclei by a supposed process called [[brachymeiosis]], but this hypothesis was disproven in the 1950s.<ref name=\"Carlile\">{{cite journal | last=Carlile | first=Michael J. | title=Two influential mycologists: Helen Gwynne-Vaughan (1879-1967) and Lilian Hawker (1908-1991) | journal=Mycologist | volume=19 | issue=3 | year=2005 | pages=129\u2013131 | doi=10.1017/s0269915x05003058}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hypomyces chrysospermus.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Unitunicate-inoperculate Asci of ''Hypomyces chrysospermus'']]\nFrom the fertilized ascogonium, ''dinucleate'' hyphae emerge in which each cell contains two nuclei. These hyphae are called ''ascogenous'' or fertile hyphae. They are supported by the vegetative mycelium containing uni\u2013 (or mono\u2013) nucleate hyphae, which are sterile. The mycelium containing both sterile and fertile hyphae may grow into fruiting body, the ''[[ascocarp]]'', which may contain millions of fertile hyphae.\n\nAn ascocarp is the fruiting body of the sexual phase in Ascomycota. There are five morphologically different types of ascocarp, namely:\n\n* Naked asci: these occur in simple ascomycetes; asci are produced on the organism's surface.\n* [[Ascocarp#Perithecium|Perithecia]]: Asci are in flask-shaped ascoma (perithecium) with a pore (ostiole) at the top.\n* [[Ascocarp#Cleistothecium|Cleistothecia]]: The ascocarp (a cleistothecium) is spherical and closed.\n* [[Ascocarp#Apothecium|Apothecia]]: The asci are in a bowl shaped ascoma (apothecium). These are sometimes called the \"cup fungi\". \n* [[Ascocarp#Pseudothecium|Pseudothecia]]: Asci with two layers, produced in pseudothecia that look like perithecia. The ascospores are arranged irregularly.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.microscopemaster.com/ascomycota.html|title=Ascomycota - Characteristics, Nutrition and Significance|website=MicroscopeMaster|language=en|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref>\n\nThe sexual structures are formed in the fruiting layer of the ascocarp, the [[hymenium]]. At one end of ascogenous hyphae, characteristic U-shaped hooks develop, which curve back opposite to the growth direction of the hyphae. The two nuclei contained in the apical part of each hypha divide in such a way that the threads of their [[mitotic spindle]]s run parallel, creating two pairs of genetically different nuclei. One daughter nucleus migrates close to the hook, while the other daughter nucleus locates to the basal part of the hypha. The formation of two parallel cross-walls then divides the hypha into three sections: one at the hook with one nucleus, one at the basal of the original hypha that contains one nucleus, and one that separates the U-shaped part, which contains the other two nuclei.\n[[File:Ascocarp2.png|thumb|right|alt=Cross-section of a cup-shaped structure showing locations of developing meiotic asci (upper edge of cup, left side, arrows pointing to two gray-colored cells containing four and two small circles), sterile hyphae (upper edge of cup, right side, arrows pointing to white-colored cells with a single small circle in them), and mature asci (upper edge of cup, pointing to two gray-colored cells with eight small circles in them)|Diagram of an [[apothecium]] (the typical cup-like reproductive structure of Ascomycetes) showing sterile tissues as well as developing and mature asci.]]\n\nFusion of the nuclei (karyogamy) takes place in the U-shaped cells in the hymenium, and results in the formation of a diploid [[zygote]]. The zygote grows into the [[ascus]], an elongated tube-shaped or cylinder-shaped capsule. Meiosis then gives rise to four [[ploidy#Haploid and monoploid|haploid]] nuclei, usually followed by a further mitotic division that results in eight nuclei in each ascus. The nuclei along with some cytoplasma become enclosed within membranes and a cell wall to give rise to ascospores that are aligned inside the ascus like peas in a pod.\n\nUpon opening of the ascus, ascospores may be dispersed by the wind, while in some cases the spores are forcibly ejected form the ascus; certain species have evolved spore cannons, which can eject ascospores up to 30&nbsp;cm. away. When the spores reach a suitable substrate, they germinate, form new hyphae, which restarts the fungal life cycle.\n\nThe form of the ascus is important for classification and is divided into four basic types: unitunicate-operculate, unitunicate-inoperculate, bitunicate, or prototunicate. See the article on [[Ascus|asci]] for further details.\n\n== Ecology ==\nThe Ascomycota fulfil a central role in most land-based [[ecosystem]]s. They are important [[decomposer]]s, breaking down organic materials, such as dead leaves and animals, and helping the [[detritivore]]s (animals that feed on decomposing material) to obtain their nutrients. Ascomycetes along with other fungi can break down large [[Biopolymer|molecules]] such as [[cellulose]] or [[lignin]], and thus have important roles in nutrient cycling such as the [[carbon cycle]].\n\nThe fruiting bodies of the Ascomycota provide food for many animals ranging from [[insect]]s and slugs and snails (''[[Gastropoda]]'') to [[rodent]]s and larger mammals such as [[deer]] and [[wild boar]]s.\n\nMany ascomycetes also form [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationships with other organisms, including plants and animals.\n\n=== Lichens ===\n{{main|Lichen}}\nProbably since early in their evolutionary history, the Ascomycota have formed symbiotic associations with [[green algae]] (''Chlorophyta''), and other types of [[algae]] and [[cyanobacteria]]. These mutualistic associations are commonly known as [[lichen]]s, and can grow and persist in terrestrial regions of the earth that are inhospitable to other organisms and characterized by extremes in temperature and humidity, including the [[Arctic]], the [[Antarctic]], [[desert]]s, and mountaintops. While the [[photoautotroph]]ic algal partner generates metabolic energy through photosynthesis, the fungus offers a stable, supportive matrix and protects cells from radiation and dehydration. Around 42% of the Ascomycota (about 18,000 species) form lichens, and almost all the fungal partners of lichens belong to the Ascomycota.\n\n=== Mycorrhizal fungi and endophytes ===\nMembers of the Ascomycota form two important types of relationship with plants: as [[mycorrhiza]]l fungi and as [[endophyte]]s. Mycorrhiza are [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] associations of fungi with the root systems of the plants, which can be of vital importance for growth and persistence for the plant. The fine mycelial network of the fungus enables the increased uptake of mineral salts that occur at low levels in the soil. In return, the plant provides the fungus with metabolic energy in the form of [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] products.\n\nEndophytic fungi live inside plants, and those that form mutualistic or [[commensalism|commensal]] associations with their host, do not damage their hosts. The exact nature of the relationship between endophytic fungus and host depends on the species involved, and in some cases fungal colonization of plants can bestow a higher resistance against insects, [[roundworm]]s (nematodes), and [[bacteria]]; in the case of [[Neotyphodium|grass endophytes]] the fungal symbiont produces poisonous [[alkaloid]]s, which can affect the health of plant-eating (herbivorous) [[mammal]]s and deter or kill insect herbivores.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Schulz B, Boyle C.|year=2005 |title=The endophytic continuum |journal=Mycological Research |volume=109 |issue=6 |pages=661\u201386 |pmid=16080390 |doi= 10.1017/S095375620500273X |first1= B |last2= Boyle |first2= C}}</ref>\n\n=== Symbiotic relationships with animals ===\nSeveral ascomycetes of the genus ''[[Xylaria]]'' colonize the nests of [[leafcutter ant]]s and other [[fungus-growing ants]] of the tribe [[Attini]], and the fungal gardens of [[termite]]s (Isoptera). Since they do not generate fruiting bodies until the insects have left the nests, it is suspected that, as confirmed in several cases of [[Basidiomycota]] species, they may be cultivated.{{Clarify|this sentence is very confusing|date=September 2009}}\n\n[[Bark beetle]]s (family Scolytidae) are important symbiotic partners of ascomycetes. The female beetles transport fungal spores to new hosts in characteristic tucks in their skin, the ''[[mycetangia]]''. The beetle tunnels into the wood and into large chambers in which they lay their eggs. Spores released from the mycetangia germinate into hyphae, which can break down the wood. The beetle larvae then feed on the fungal mycelium, and, on reaching maturity, carry new spores with them to renew the cycle of infection. A well-known example of this is [[Dutch elm disease]], caused by ''[[Ophiostoma ulmi]]'', which is carried by the European elm bark beetle, ''[[Scolytus multistriatus]]''.<ref name=\"Moser 2010\">{{cite journal |author1=Moser, J.C. |author2=Konrad, H. |author3=Blomquist, S.R. |author4=Kirisits, T. |year=2010 |title=Do mites phoretic on elm bark beetles contribute to the transmission of Dutch elm disease? |journal=Naturwissenschaften |volume=97 |issue=2 |pages=219\u2013227 |doi=10.1007/s00114-009-0630-x |pmid=19967528|bibcode=2010NW.....97..219M |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1232603 }}</ref>\n\n=== Plant disease interactions ===\nOne of their most harmful roles is as the agent of many plant diseases. For instance:\n\n* [[Dutch Elm Disease]], caused by the closely related species ''Ophiostoma ulmi'' and ''Ophiostoma novo-ulmi'', has led to the death of many elms in Europe and North America.\n* The originally Asian [[Chestnut blight|''Cryphonectria parasitica'']] is responsible for attacking Sweet Chestnuts (''[[Castanea sativa]]''), and virtually eliminated the once-widespread [[American Chestnut]] (''Castanea dentata''),\n* A disease of [[maize]] (''Zea mays''), which is especially prevalent in North America, is brought about by ''[[Cochliobolus heterostrophus]]''.\n* ''[[Taphrina deformans]]'' causes [[leaf curl]] of peach.\n* ''[[Uncinula necator]]'' is responsible for the disease [[powdery mildew]], which attacks grapevines.\n* Species of ''[[Monilinia]]'' cause brown rot of stone fruit such as peaches (''Prunus persica'') and sour cherries (''Prunus ceranus'').\n* Members of the Ascomycota such as ''[[Stachybotrys chartarum]]'' are responsible for fading of woolen textiles, which is a common problem especially in the tropics.\n* Blue-green, red and brown [[mold]]s attack and spoil foodstuffs - for instance ''[[Penicillium italicum]]'' rots oranges.\n* Cereals infected with ''[[Fusarium graminearum]]'' contain [[mycotoxin]]s like [[deoxynivalenol]] (DON), which causes [[Fusarium ear blight]] and skin and mucous membrane lesions when eaten by pigs.\n\n=== Human disease interactions ===\n\n* ''[[Aspergillus fumigatus]]'', the most common cause of fungal infection in the lungs of immune compromised patients often resulting in death. Also the most frequent cause of [[Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis]], which often occurs in patients with [[Cystic fibrosis]] as well as [[Asthma]]. \n* ''[[Candida albicans]]'', a yeast that attacks the mucous membranes, can cause an infection of the mouth or vagina called thrush or [[candidiasis]], and is also blamed for \"yeast allergies\".\n* Fungi like ''[[Epidermophyton]]'' cause skin infections but are not very dangerous for people with healthy immune systems. However, if the immune system is damaged they can be life-threatening; for instance, ''[[Pneumocystis jirovecii]]'' is responsible for severe lung infections that occur in [[AIDS]] patients.\n* [[Ergot]] (''Claviceps purpurea'') is a direct menace to humans when it attacks wheat or rye and produces highly poisonous [[alkaloid]]s, causing [[ergotism]] if consumed. Symptoms include hallucinations, stomach cramps, and a burning sensation in the limbs (\"[[Ergotism|Saint Anthony's Fire]]\").\n* ''[[Aspergillus flavus]]'', which grows on peanuts and other hosts, generates [[aflatoxin]], which damages the liver and is highly carcinogenic.\n\n=== Beneficial effects for humans ===\nOn the other hand, ascus fungi have brought some important benefits to humanity.\n* The most famous case may be that of the mould ''[[Penicillium chrysogenum]]'' (formerly ''Penicillium notatum''), which, probably to attack competing bacteria, produces an antibiotic that, under the name of [[penicillin]], triggered a revolution in the treatment of bacterial infectious diseases in the 20th century.\n* The medical importance of ''[[Tolypocladium niveum]]'' as an [[immunosuppression|immunosuppressor]] can hardly be exaggerated. It excretes [[Ciclosporin]], which, as well as being given during [[Organ transplantation]] to prevent rejection, is also prescribed for auto-immune diseases such as [[multiple sclerosis]], although there is some doubt over the long-term side-effects of the treatment.\n[[File:Blue Stilton Quarter Front.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Stilton cheese veined with ''Penicillium roqueforti'']]\n* Some ascomycete fungi can be altered relatively easily through [[genetic engineering]] procedures. They can then produce useful proteins such as [[insulin]], [[human growth hormone]], or TPa, which is employed to dissolve blood clots.\n* Several species are common [[model organism]]s in biology, including ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'', ''[[Schizosaccharomyces pombe]]'', and ''[[Neurospora crassa]]''. The [[genome]]s of a number of ascomycete fungi have been fully sequenced.\n* Baker's Yeast (''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'') is used to make [[bread]], [[beer]] and [[wine]], during which process sugars such as [[glucose]] or [[sucrose]] are fermented to make [[ethanol]] and [[carbon dioxide]]. Bakers use the yeast for carbon dioxide production, causing the bread to rise, with the ethanol boiling off during cooking. Most vintners use it for ethanol production, with the carbon dioxide being released into the atmosphere during fermentation. Brewers and traditional producers of [[sparkling wine]] use both, with a primary fermentation for the alcohol and a secondary one to produce the carbon dioxide bubbles that provide the drinks with \"sparkling\" texture in the case of wine and the desirable foam in the case of beer.\n* Enzymes of ''[[Penicillium camemberti]]'' play a role in the manufacture of the cheeses [[Camembert]] and [[Brie]], while those of ''[[Penicillium roqueforti]]'' do the same for [[Gorgonzola (cheese)|Gorgonzola]], [[Roquefort]] and [[Stilton cheese|Stilton]].\n* In Asia, ''[[Aspergillus oryzae]]'' is added to a pulp of soaked soya beans to make [[soy sauce]], and is used to break down starch in rice and other grains into simple sugars for fermentation into East Asian alcoholic beverages such as [[huangjiu]] and [[sake]].\n* Finally, some members of the Ascomycota are choice edibles; [[Morchella|morel]]s (''Morchella spp.''), [[truffle]]s (''Tuber spp.''), and [[Hypomyces lactifluorum|lobster mushroom]] (''Hypomyces lactifluorum'') are some of the most sought-after fungal delicacies.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Ascomycota families incertae sedis|List of Ascomycota families ''incertae sedis'']]\n* [[List of Ascomycota genera incertae sedis|List of Ascomycota genera ''incertae sedis'']]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Cited texts ==\n{{Wikispecies|Ascomycota}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last=Alexopoulos |first=C.J. |last2=Mims |first2=C.W. |last3=Blackwell |first3=M. | title=Introductory Mycology | year=1996 | publisher=Wiley | isbn=0-471-52229-5 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Deacon |first=J. |title=Fungal Biology |publisher=Blackwell |year=2005 |isbn=1-4051-3066-0 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |vauthors=Jennings DH, Lysek G |title=Fungal Biology: Understanding the Fungal Lifestyle|year=1996 |publisher=Bios Scientific |location=Guildford, UK |isbn=978-1-85996-150-6}}\n* {{cite book |vauthors=Kirk PM, Cannon PF, Minter DW, Stalpers JA |title=Dictionary of the Fungi |edition=10th |publisher=CABI |location=Wallingford |year=2008|isbn=978-0-85199-826-8}}\n* {{cite book |vauthors=Taylor EL, Taylor TN |title=The Biology and Evolution of Fossil Plants |publisher=Prentice Hall  |year=1993 |isbn=0-13-651589-4}}\n{{refend}}\n\n{{Eukaryota classification}}\n{{Fungi classification}}\n{{Life on Earth}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q174726}}\n\n[[Category:Mycology]]\n[[Category:Ascomycota| ]]\n[[Category:Fungus phyla]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Division or phylum of fungi}}\n{{Automatic taxobox\n| image = Scarlet elf cap cadnant dingle.jpg\n| image_caption = ''[[Sarcoscypha coccinea]]''\n| taxon = Ascomycota\n| authority = ([[Berk.]]) [[Caval.-Sm.]] (1998)<ref>{{cite journal|author=Cavalier-Smith, T.|year=1998 |title=A revised six-kingdom system of Life |journal=Biological Reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society |volume=73 |issue=3 |pages=203\u2013266 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayIssue?jid=BRE&volumeId=73&issueId=03#|doi=10.1111/j.1469-185X.1998.tb00030.x|pmid=9809012}}</ref>\n| subdivision_ranks = Subdivisions/Classes\n| subdivision =\n:[[Pezizomycotina]]\n::[[Arthoniomycetes]]\n::[[Coniocybomycetes]]\n::[[Dothideomycetes]]\n::[[Eurotiomycetes]]\n::[[Geoglossomycetes]]\n::[[Laboulbeniomycetes]]\n::[[Lecanoromycetes]]\n::[[Leotiomycetes]]\n::[[Lichinomycetes]]\n::[[Orbiliomycetes]]\n::[[Pezizomycetes]]\n::[[Sordariomycetes]]\n::[[Xylonomycetes]]\n::\"Unplaced orders\"\n::::[[Lahmiales]]\n::::[[Itchiclahmadion]]\n::::[[Triblidiales]]\n:[[Saccharomycotina]]\n::[[Saccharomycetes]]\n:[[Taphrinomycotina]]\n::[[Archaeorhizomyces]]\n::[[Neolectomycetes]]\n::[[Pneumocystis|Pneumocystidomycetes]]\n::[[Schizosaccharomycetes]]\n::[[Taphrinomycetes]]\n}}\n\n'''Ascomycota''' is a [[phylum]] of the kingdom [[Fungi]] that, together with the [[Basidiomycota]], forms the subkingdom [[Dikarya]]. Its members are commonly known as the '''sac fungi''' or '''ascomycetes'''. It is the largest phylum of Fungi, with over 64,000 [[species]].<ref>Kirk ''et al''., p. 55.</ref> The defining feature of this fungal group is the \"[[ascus]]\" (from [[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|\u1f00\u03c3\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2}} (''askos''), meaning \"sac\" or \"wineskin\"), a microscopic [[Sexual reproduction|sexual structure]] in which nonmotile [[spore]]s, called [[ascospore]]s, are formed. However, some species of the Ascomycota are [[Teleomorph, anamorph and holomorph|asexual]], meaning that they do not have a sexual cycle and thus do not form asci or ascospores.  Familiar examples of sac fungi include [[Morchella|morel]]s, [[truffle]]s, [[yeast#Beer|brewer's yeast]] and [[baker's yeast]], [[Xylaria|dead man's fingers]], and [[Pezizaceae|cup fungi]]. The fungal [[symbiosis|symbiont]]s in the majority of [[lichen]]s (loosely termed \"ascolichens\") such as ''[[Cladonia]]'' belong to the Ascomycota.\n\nAscomycota is a [[monophyly|monophyletic]] group (it contains all descendants of one common ancestor). Previously placed in the [[Deuteromycota]] along with asexual species from other fungal taxa, asexual (or [[Teleomorph, anamorph and holomorph|anamorph]]ic) ascomycetes are now identified and classified based on [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] or [[physiological]] similarities to ascus-bearing [[Taxon|taxa]], and by [[phylogenetic]] analyses of [[DNA]] sequences.<ref name=Lutzoni_2004>{{cite journal|author=Lutzoni F|title= Assembling the fungal tree of life: progress, classification, and evolution of subcellular traits|journal=American Journal of Botany|year=2004|pages=1446\u201380|volume=91|doi=10.3732/ajb.91.10.1446|issue=10|pmid=21652303|display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref name=James_2006>{{cite journal|author=James TY|title=Reconstructing the early evolution of Fungi using a six-gene phylogeny|journal=Nature|year=2006|pages=818\u201322|volume=443|pmid=17051209|doi=10.1038/nature05110|issue=7113|display-authors=etal|bibcode=2006Natur.443..818J|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/185458f908ccf9f23e4308506aee2ffc4a129687}}</ref>\n\nThe ascomycetes are of particular use to humans as sources of medicinally important compounds, such as [[antibacterial|antibiotics]], for [[fermentation|fermenting]] bread, alcoholic beverages and cheese. ''[[Penicillium]]'' species on cheeses and those producing antibiotics for treating bacterial [[infectious disease]]s are examples of ascomycetes.\n\nMany ascomycetes are [[pathogen]]s, both of animals, including humans, and of plants. Examples of ascomycetes that can cause infections in humans include ''[[Candida albicans]]'', ''[[Aspergillus niger]]'' and several tens of species that cause [[Dermatophytosis|skin infections]]. The many [[plant pathology|plant-pathogenic]] ascomycetes include [[apple scab]], [[Magnaporthe grisea|rice blast]], the [[Ergot|ergot fungi]], [[Dibotryon morbosum|black knot]], and the [[powdery mildew]]s.\nSeveral species of ascomycetes are biological [[model organism]]s in laboratory research. Most famously, ''[[Neurospora crassa]]'', several species of [[yeast]]s, and ''[[Aspergillus]]'' species are used in many [[genetics]] and [[cell biology]] studies.\n\n== Asexual reproduction in ascomycetes and their characteristics ==\n'''Ascomycetes:'''\n\nAscomycetes are 'spore shooters'. They are fungi which produce microscopic spores inside special, elongated cells or sacs, known as 'asci', which give the group its name.\n\n'''Asexual reproduction:'''\n\nAsexual reproduction is the dominant form of propagation in the Ascomycota, and is responsible for the rapid spread of these fungi into new areas. Asexual reproduction of ascomycetes is very diverse from both structural and functional points of view. The most important and general is production of conidia, but chlamydospores are also frequently produced. Furthermore, Ascomycota also reproduce asexually through budding.\n\n#'''Conidia formation:'''\n\nAsexual reproduction may occur through vegetative reproductive spores, the conidia. The asexual, non-motile haploid spores of a fungus, which are named after the Greek word for dust (conia), are hence also known as conidiospores and mitospores. The '''[[conidiospores]]''' commonly contain one nucleus and are products of mitotic cell divisions and thus are sometimes call '''mitospores''', which are genetically identical to the mycelium from which they originate. They are typically formed at the ends of specialized hyphae, the conidiophores. Depending on the species they may be dispersed by wind or water, or by animals. Conidiophores may simply branch off from the mycelia or they may be formed in fruiting bodies.\n[[File:Conidia Formation.png|thumb|424x424px]]\nThe hypha that creates the sporing (conidiating) tip can be very similar to the normal hyphal tip, or it can be differentiated. The most common differentiation is the formation of a bottle shaped cell called a '''[[phialide]],''' from which the spores are produced. Not all of these asexual structures are a single hypha. In some groups, the conidiophores (the structures that bear the conidia) are aggregated to form a thick structure.\n\nE.g. In the order ''Moniliales,'' all of them are single hyphae with the exception of the aggregations, termed as coremia or synnema. These produce structures rather like corn-stokes, with many conidia being produced in a mass from the aggregated conidiophores.\n\nThe diverse conidia and conidiophores sometimes develop in asexual sporocarps with different characteristics (e.g. acervulus, pycnidium, sporodochium). Some species of ''Ascomycetes'' form their structures within plant tissue, either as parasite or saprophytes. These fungi have evolved more complex asexual sporing structures, probably influenced by the cultural conditions of plant tissue as a substrate. These structures are called the '''sporodochium'''. This is a cushion of conidiophores created from a pseudoparenchymatous [[stroma (mycology)|stroma]] in plant tissue. The '''[[pycnidium]]''' is a globose to flask-shaped parenchymatous structure, lined on its inner wall with conidiophores. The '''[[acervulus]]''' is a flat saucer shaped bed of conidiophores produced under a plant cuticle, which eventually erupt through the cuticle for dispersal.\n[[File:Conidia Formation Image.png|thumb|333x333px]]\n'''2) Budding:'''\n\nAsexual reproduction process in ascomycetes also involves the budding which we clearly observe in '''yeast'''. This is termed a \"blastic process\". It involves the blowing out or blebbing of the hyphal tip wall. The blastic process can involve all wall layers, or there can be a new cell wall synthesized which is extruded from within the old wall.\n[[File:Budding.png|centre|thumb|337x337px]]\nThe initial events of budding can be seen as the development of a ring of chitin around the point where the bud is about to appear. This reinforces and stabilizes the cell wall. Enzymatic activity and turgor pressure act to weaken and extrude the cell wall. New cell wall material is incorporated during this phase. Cell contents are forced into the progeny cell, and as the final phase of mitosis ends a cell plate, the point at which a new cell wall will grow inwards from, forms.\n\n===Characteristics of ascomycetes===\n\n* Ascomycota are morphologically diverse. The group includes organisms from unicellular yeasts to complex cup fungi.\n* There are 2000 identified genera and 30,000 species of Ascomycota.\n* The unifying characteristic among these diverse groups is the presence of a reproductive structure known as the '''ascus''', though in some cases it has a reduced role in the life cycle.\n* Many ascomycetes are of commercial importance. Some play a beneficial role, such as the yeasts used in baking, brewing, and wine fermentation, plus truffles and morels, which are held as gourmet delicacies.\n* Many of them cause tree diseases, such as Dutch elm disease and apple blights.\n* Some of the plant pathogenic ascomycetes are apple scab, rice blast, the ergot fungi, black knot, and the powdery mildews.\n* The yeasts are used to produce alcoholic beverages and breads. The mold ''Penicillium'' is used to produce the antibiotic penicillin.\n* Almost half of all members of the phylum Ascomycota form '''symbiotic''' associations with algae to form lichens.\n* Others, such as morels (a highly prized edible fungi), form important '''mycorrhizal''' relationships with plants, thereby providing enhanced water and nutrient uptake and, in some cases, protection from insects.\n* Almost all ascomycetes are terrestrial or parasitic.  However, a few have adapted to marine or freshwater environments.\n* The cell walls of the hyphae are variably composed of '''chitin''' and \u03b2-glucans, just as in Basidiomycota.  However, these fibers are set in a matrix of glycoprotein containing the sugars galactose and mannose.\n* The mycelium of ascomycetes is usually made up of '''septate hyphae'''.  However, there is not necessarily any fixed number of nuclei in each of the divisions.\n* The septal walls have septal pores which provide cytoplasmic continuity throughout the individual hyphae.  Under appropriate conditions, nuclei may also migrate between septal compartments through the septal pores.\n* A unique character of the Ascomycota (but not present in all ascomycetes) is the presence of '''Woronin bodies''' on each side of the septa separating the hyphal segments which control the septal pores.  If an adjoining hypha is ruptured, the Woronin bodies block the pores to prevent loss of cytoplasm into the ruptured compartment.  The Woronin bodies are spherical, hexagonal, or rectangular membrane bound structures with a crystalline protein matrix.\n\n== Modern classification ==\nThere are three [[subphylum|subphyla]] that are described and accepted:\n* The ''[[Pezizomycotina]]'' are the largest subphylum and contains all ascomycetes that produce [[ascocarp]]s (fruiting bodies), except for one genus, ''[[Neolecta]]'', in the [[Taphrinomycotina]]. It is roughly equivalent to the previous taxon, ''Euascomycetes''. The Pezizomycotina includes most macroscopic \"ascos\" such as [[truffle]]s, [[ergot]], ascolichens, [[Pezizaceae|cup fungi]] ([[discomycetes]]), [[Sordariomycetes|pyrenomycetes]], [[Gyromitra esculenta|lorchels]], and [[Ophiocordyceps sinensis|caterpillar fungus]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.herbarium.usu.edu/fungi/FunFacts/Caterpillar.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312153703/http://www.herbarium.usu.edu/fungi/FunFacts/Caterpillar.htm|title=Caterpillar Fungus|archive-date=2007-03-12}}</ref> It also contains microscopic fungi such as [[powdery mildew]]s, [[Trichophyton|dermatophytic]] fungi, and [[Laboulbeniales]].\n* The ''[[Saccharomycotina]]'' comprise most of the \"true\" yeasts, such as [[baker's yeast]] and ''[[Candida (genus)|Candida]]'', which are single-celled (unicellular) fungi, which reproduce vegetatively by budding. Most of these species were previously classified in a taxon called ''Hemiascomycetes''.\n* The ''[[Taphrinomycotina]]'' include a disparate and [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] group within the Ascomycota that was recognized following molecular ([[DNA]]) analyses. The taxon was originally named ''[[Archiascomycetes]]'' (or ''[[Archaeascomycetes]]''). It includes hyphal fungi (''[[Neolecta]]'', ''[[Taphrina]]'', ''[[Archaeorhizomyces]]''), fission yeasts (''[[Schizosaccharomyces]]''), and the mammalian lung parasite ''[[Pneumocystis]]''.\n\n== Outdated taxon names ==\nSeveral outdated taxon names\u2014based on morphological features\u2014are still occasionally used for species of the Ascomycota. These include the following sexual ([[Teleomorph, anamorph and holomorph|teleomorph]]ic) groups, defined by the structures of their sexual [[Sporocarp (fungi)|fruiting bodies]]: the [[Discomycetes]], which included all species forming [[ascocarp|apothecia]]; the [[Pyrenomycetes]], which included all sac fungi that formed [[ascocarp|perithecia]] or [[ascocarp|pseudothecia]], or any structure resembling these morphological structures; and the Plectomycetes, which included those species that form [[ascocarp|cleistothecia]]. [[Hemiascomycetes]] included the yeasts and yeast-like fungi that have now been placed into the [[Saccharomycotina]] or [[Taphrinomycotina]], while the [[Euascomycetes]] included the remaining species of the Ascomycota, which are now in the [[Pezizomycotina]], and the [[Neolecta]], which are in the Taphrinomycotina.\n\nSome ascomycetes do not reproduce sexually or are not known to produce [[ascus|asci]] and are therefore [[Teleomorph, anamorph and holomorph|anamorph]]ic species. Those anamorphs that produce [[Conidium|conidia]] (mitospores) were previously described as [[mitosporic Ascomycota]]. Some taxonomists placed this group into a separate [[form classification|artificial phylum]], the [[Deuteromycota]] (or \"Fungi Imperfecti\"). Where recent [[Molecular phylogenetics|molecular analyses]] have identified close relationships with ascus-bearing taxa, anamorphic species have been grouped into the Ascomycota, despite the absence of the defining ascus. Sexual and asexual isolates of the same species commonly carry different [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial]] species names, as, for example, ''[[Aspergillus nidulans]]'' and ''Emericella nidulans'', for asexual and sexual isolates, respectively, of the same species.\n\nSpecies of the Deuteromycota were classified as Coelomycetes if they produced their conidia in minute flask- or saucer-shaped conidiomata, known technically as ''pycnidia'' and ''acervuli''.<ref>{{harvnb|Alexopoulos|Mims|Blackwell|1996|p=233}}</ref> The [[Hyphomycetes]] were those species where the [[conidiophore]]s (''i.e.'', the hyphal structures that carry conidia-forming cells at the end) are free or loosely organized. They are mostly isolated but sometimes also appear as bundles of cells aligned in parallel (described as ''synnematal'') or as cushion-shaped masses (described as ''sporodochial'').<ref>{{harvnb|Alexopoulos|Mims|Blackwell|1996|pp=218\u2013222}}</ref>\n\n== Morphology ==\n[[File:Cordyceps ignota.JPG|thumb|right| A member of the genus ''[[Cordyceps]]'' which is parasitic on arthropods. Note the elongated stromata. Species unknown, perhaps ''Cordyceps ignota''.]]\n\nMost species grow as filamentous, microscopic structures called [[hypha]]e or as budding single cells (yeasts). Many [[Anastomosis|interconnected]] hyphae form a [[thallus]] usually referred to as the [[mycelium]], which\u2014when visible to the naked eye (macroscopic)\u2014is commonly called [[mold]]. During sexual reproduction, many Ascomycota typically produce large numbers of [[ascus|asci]]. The ascus is often contained in a multicellular, occasionally readily visible fruiting structure, the [[ascocarp]] (also called an ''ascoma''). Ascocarps come in a very large variety of shapes: cup-shaped, club-shaped, potato-like, spongy, seed-like, oozing and pimple-like, coral-like, nit-like, golf-ball-shaped, perforated tennis ball-like, cushion-shaped, plated and feathered in miniature ([[Laboulbeniales]]), microscopic classic Greek shield-shaped, stalked or sessile. They can appear solitary or clustered. Their texture can likewise be very variable, including fleshy, like charcoal (carbonaceous), leathery, rubbery, gelatinous, slimy, powdery, or cob-web-like. Ascocarps come in multiple colors such as red, orange, yellow, brown, black, or, more rarely, green or blue. Some ascomyceous fungi, such as ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'', grow as single-celled yeasts, which\u2014during sexual reproduction\u2014develop into an ascus, and do not form fruiting bodies.\n[[File:Xylaria hypoxylon.jpg|thumb|left|The \"candlesnuff fungus\" in its asexual state, ''[[Xylaria hypoxylon]]'']]\n\nIn [[lichen]]ized species, the thallus of the fungus defines the shape of the [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] colony. Some [[Phenotypic switching|dimorphic]] species, such as ''[[Candida albicans]]'', can switch between growth as single cells and as filamentous, multicellular hyphae. Other species are [[pleomorphism (microbiology)|pleomorphic]], exhibiting asexual (anamorphic) as well as a sexual (teleomorphic) growth forms.\n\nExcept for lichens, the non-reproductive (vegetative) mycelium of most ascomycetes is usually inconspicuous because it is commonly embedded in the substrate, such as soil, or grows on or inside a living host, and only the ascoma may be seen when fruiting. [[Pigment]]ation, such as [[melanin]] in hyphal walls, along with prolific growth on surfaces can result in visible mold colonies; examples include ''[[Cladosporium]]'' species, which form black spots on bathroom caulking and other moist areas. Many ascomycetes cause food spoilage, and, therefore, the pellicles or moldy layers that develop on jams, juices, and other foods are the mycelia of these species or occasionally [[Mucoromycotina]] and almost never [[Basidiomycota]]. [[Sooty mold]]s that develop on plants, especially in the tropics are the thalli of many species.{{Clarify|many ascomycetous species?|date=September 2009}}\n[[File:Smardz-Morchella-Ejdzej-2006.jpg|thumb|right|179px|The ascocarp of a [[Morchella|morel]] contains numerous apothecia.]]\n\nLarge masses of yeast cells, asci or ascus-like cells, or conidia can also form macroscopic structures.

The cell wall and septa give stability and rigidity to the hyphae and may prevent loss of [[cytoplasm]] in case of local damage to cell wall and [[cell membrane]]. The septa commonly have a small opening in the center, which functions as a [[cytoplasm]]ic connection between adjacent cells, also sometimes allowing cell-to-cell movement of [[Cell nucleus|nuclei]] within a hypha. Vegetative hyphae of most ascomycetes contain only one nucleus per cell (''[[uninucleate]]'' hyphae), but [[multinucleate]] cells\u2014especially in the apical regions of growing hyphae\u2014can also be present.\n\n== Metabolism ==\nIn common with other fungal phyla, the Ascomycota are [[Heterotrophy|heterotrophic]] organisms that require [[organic compound]]s as energy sources. These are obtained by feeding on a variety of organic substrates including dead matter, foodstuffs, or as [[symbiosis|symbiont]]s in or on other living organisms. To obtain these nutrients from their surroundings, ascomycetous fungi secrete powerful [[digestive enzyme]]s that break down organic substances into smaller molecules, which are then taken up into the cell. Many species live on dead plant material such as leaves, twigs, or logs. Several species colonize plants, animals, or other fungi as [[parasite]]s or [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic symbionts]] and derive all their metabolic energy in form of nutrients from the tissues of their hosts.\n\nOwing to their long evolutionary history, the Ascomycota have evolved the capacity to break down almost every organic substance. Unlike most organisms, they are able to use their own [[enzyme]]s to digest plant [[biopolymer]]s such as [[cellulose]] or [[lignin]]. [[Collagen]], an abundant structural protein in animals, and [[keratin]]\u2014a protein that forms hair and nails\u2014, can also serve as food sources. Unusual examples include ''[[Aureobasidium pullulans]]'', which feeds on wall paint, and the kerosene fungus ''[[Amorphotheca resinae]]'', which feeds on aircraft fuel (causing occasional problems for the airline industry), and may sometimes block fuel pipes.<ref name=Hendey>{{cite journal | last1 = Hendey | first1 = N.

Many Ascomycota engage in symbiotic relationships such as in lichens\u2014symbiotic associations with green [[algae]] or [[cyanobacteria]]\u2014in which the fungal symbiont directly obtains products of [[photosynthesis]]. In common with many basidiomycetes and [[Glomeromycota]], some ascomycetes form symbioses with plants by colonizing the roots to form [[mycorrhiza]]l associations.

If the spore is divided into two by a cross-wall ([[septum#In mycology|septum]]), it is called a ''didymospore''.\n{| align=\"right\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"\n|[[File:Trichoderma aggressivum.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|Conidiospores of ''Trichoderma aggressivum'', Diameter approx. 3\u00b5m]]\n|-\n|[[File:Aspergillus.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Conidiophores of molds of the genus ''Aspergillus'', conidiogenesis is blastic-phialidic]]\n|-\n|[[File:Trichoderma harzianum.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Conidiophores of ''[[Trichoderma harzianum]]'', conidiogenesis is blastic-phialidic]]\n|-\n|[[File:Trichoderma fertile.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Conidiophores of ''Trichoderma fertile'' with vase-shaped phialides and newly formed conidia on their ends (bright points)]]\n|}\n\nWhen there are two or more cross-walls, the classification depends on spore shape. If the septae are ''transversal'', like the rungs of a ladder, it is a ''phragmospore'', and if they possess a net-like structure it is a ''dictyospore''. In ''staurospores'' ray-like arms radiate from a central body; in others (''helicospores'') the entire spore is wound up in a spiral like a spring. Very long worm-like spores with a length-to-diameter ratio of more than 15:1, are called ''scolecospores''.\n\n==== Conidiogenesis and dehiscence ====\nImportant characteristics of the anamorphs of the Ascomycota are ''conidiogenesis'', which includes spore formation and dehiscence (separation from the parent structure). Conidiogenesis corresponds to [[Embryology]] in animals and plants and can be divided into two fundamental forms of development: ''blastic'' conidiogenesis, where the spore is already evident before it separates from the conidiogenic hypha, and ''thallic'' conidiogenesis, during which a cross-wall forms and the newly created cell develops into a spore. The spores may or may not be generated in a large-scale specialized structure that helps to spread them.\n\nThese two basic types can be further classified as follows:\n* ''blastic-acropetal'' (repeated budding at the tip of the conidiogenic hypha, so that a chain of spores is formed with the youngest spores at the tip),\n* ''blastic-synchronous'' (simultaneous spore formation from a central cell, sometimes with secondary acropetal chains forming from the initial spores),\n* ''blastic-sympodial'' (repeated sideways spore formation from behind the leading spore, so that the oldest spore is at the main tip),\n* ''blastic-annellidic'' (each spore separates and leaves a ring-shaped scar inside the scar left by the previous spore),\n* ''blastic-phialidic'' (the spores arise and are ejected from the open ends of special conidiogenic cells called [[phialide]]s, which remain constant in length),\n* ''basauxic'' (where a chain of conidia, in successively younger stages of development, is emitted from the mother cell),\n* ''blastic-retrogressive'' (spores separate by formation of crosswalls near the tip of the conidiogenic hypha, which thus becomes progressively shorter),\n* ''thallic-arthric'' (double cell walls split the conidiogenic hypha into cells that develop into short, cylindrical spores called ''arthroconidia''; sometimes every second cell dies off, leaving the arthroconidia free),\n* ''thallic-solitary'' (a large bulging cell separates from the conidiogenic hypha, forms internal walls, and develops to a ''phragmospore'').\n\nSometimes the conidia are produced in structures visible to the naked eye, which help to distribute the spores. These structures are called \"conidiomata\" (singular: [[Conidium|conidioma]]), and may take the form of ''[[Pycnidium|pycnidia]]'' (which are flask-shaped and arise in the fungal tissue) or ''acervuli'' (which are cushion-shaped and arise in host tissue).<ref>See the [[Conidium]] article for full details.</ref>\n\nDehiscence happens in two ways. In ''schizolytic'' dehiscence, a double-dividing wall with a central lamella (layer) forms between the cells; the central layer then breaks down thereby releasing the spores. In ''rhexolytic'' dehiscence, the cell wall that joins the spores on the outside degenerates and releases the conidia.\n\n=== Heterokaryosis and parasexuality ===\nSeveral Ascomycota species are not known to have a sexual cycle. Such asexual species may be able to undergo genetic recombination between individuals by processes involving ''heterokaryosis'' and ''parasexual'' events.\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br.fcgi?book=mmed&part=A3958&rendertype=figure&id=A3958 Parasexuality] refers to the process of heterokaryosis, caused by merging of two hyphae belonging to different individuals, by a process called ''[[anastomosis]]'', followed by a series of events resulting in genetically different [[Cell nucleus|cell nuclei]] in the [[mycelium]].<ref>{{harvnb|Deacon|2005|pp=164\u20136}}</ref>\nThe merging of nuclei is not followed by [[meiosis|meiotic events]], such as [[gamete]] formation and results in an increased number of [[chromosome]]s per nuclei. ''[[Mitotic crossover]]'' may enable [[genetic recombination|recombination]], i.e., an exchange of genetic material between [[homologous chromosome]]s. The chromosome number may then be restored to its [[ploidy#Haploid and monoploid|haploid]] state by [[Telophase|nuclear division]], with each daughter nuclei being genetically different from the original parent nuclei.<ref>{{harvnb|Deacon|2005|pp=167\u20138}}</ref> Alternatively, nuclei may lose some chromosomes, resulting in [[aneuploid]] cells.  ''Candida albicans'' (class Saccharomycetes) is an example of a fungus that has a parasexual cycle (see [[Candida albicans]] and [[Parasexual cycle]]).\n\n=== Sexual reproduction ===\n[[File:Hypocrea virens.jpg|thumb|right|115px|Ascus of ''Hypocrea virens'' with eight two-celled Ascospores]]\nSexual reproduction in the Ascomycota leads to the formation of the ''ascus'', the structure that defines this fungal group and distinguishes it from other fungal phyla. The ascus is a tube-shaped vessel, a ''meiosporangium'', which contains the sexual spores produced by [[meiosis]] and which are called ''ascospores''.\n\nApart from a few exceptions, such as ''[[Candida albicans]]'', most ascomycetes are [[ploidy#Haploid and monoploid|haploid]], i.e., they contain one set of [[chromosome]]s per nucleus. During sexual reproduction there is a [[ploidy#Diploid|diploid]] phase, which commonly is very short, and meiosis restores the haploid state.  The sexual cycle of one well-studied representative species of Ascomycota is described in greater detail in ''[[Neurospora crassa]]''. Also, the adaptive basis for the maintenance of sexual reproduction in the Ascomycota  [[fungus|fungi]] was reviewed by Wallen and Perlin.<ref name=\"pmid29619017\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Wallen RM, Perlin MH |title=An Overview of the Function and Maintenance of Sexual Reproduction in Dikaryotic Fungi |journal=Front Microbiol |volume=9 |issue= |pages=503 |date=2018 |pmid=29619017 |doi=10.3389/fmicb.2018.00503 |url=|pmc=5871698 }}</ref>  They concluded that the most plausible reason for the maintenance of this capability is the benefit of [[DNA repair|repairing DNA damage]] by using  [[homologous recombination|recombination]] that occurs during [[meiosis]].<ref name=\"pmid29619017\" />  DNA damage can be caused by a variety of stresses such as nutrient limitation.\n\n==== Formation of sexual spores ====\nThe sexual part of the life cycle commences when two hyphal structures [[Mating|mate]]. In the case of ''[[homothallic]]'' species, mating is enabled between hyphae of the same fungal [[cloning|clone]], whereas in ''[[heterothallic]]'' species, the two hyphae must originate from fungal clones that differ genetically, i.e., those that are of a different [[mating type]]. Mating types are typical of the fungi and correspond roughly to the sexes in plants and animals; however one species may have more than two mating types, resulting in sometimes complex [[Allorecognition#Allorecognition_phenomena|vegetative incompatibility]] systems. The adaptive function of mating type is discussed in ''[[Neurospora crassa]]''.\n\n[[Gametangia]] are sexual structures formed from hyphae, and are the generative cells. A very fine hypha, called [[:wikt:trichogyne|trichogyne]] emerges from one gametangium, the ''ascogonium'', and merges with a gametangium (the ''antheridium'') of the other fungal isolate. The nuclei in the antheridium then migrate into the ascogonium, and [[plasmogamy]]\u2014the mixing of the [[cytoplasm]]\u2014occurs. Unlike in animals and plants, plasmogamy is not immediately followed by the merging of the nuclei (called ''[[karyogamy]]''). Instead, the nuclei from the two hyphae form pairs, initiating the ''dikaryophase'' of the sexual cycle, during which time the pairs of nuclei synchronously divide. Fusion of the paired nuclei leads to mixing of the genetic material and [[genetic recombination|recombination]] and is followed by [[meiosis]]. A similar sexual cycle is present in the [[red algae]] (Rhodophyta). A discarded hypothesis held that a second karyogamy event occurred in the ascogonium prior to ascogeny, resulting in a tetraploid nucleus which divided into four diploid nuclei by meiosis and then into eight haploid nuclei by a supposed process called [[brachymeiosis]], but this hypothesis was disproven in the 1950s.<ref name=\"Carlile\">{{cite journal | last=Carlile | first=Michael J. | title=Two influential mycologists: Helen Gwynne-Vaughan (1879-1967) and Lilian Hawker (1908-1991) | journal=Mycologist | volume=19 | issue=3 | year=2005 | pages=129\u2013131 | doi=10.1017/s0269915x05003058}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Hypomyces chrysospermus.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Unitunicate-inoperculate Asci of ''Hypomyces chrysospermus'']]\nFrom the fertilized ascogonium, ''dinucleate'' hyphae emerge in which each cell contains two nuclei. These hyphae are called ''ascogenous'' or fertile hyphae. They are supported by the vegetative mycelium containing uni\u2013 (or mono\u2013) nucleate hyphae, which are sterile. The mycelium containing both sterile and fertile hyphae may grow into fruiting body, the ''[[ascocarp]]'', which may contain millions of fertile hyphae.\n\nAn ascocarp is the fruiting body of the sexual phase in Ascomycota. There are five morphologically different types of ascocarp, namely:\n\n* Naked asci: these occur in simple ascomycetes; asci are produced on the organism's surface.\n* [[Ascocarp#Perithecium|Perithecia]]: Asci are in flask-shaped ascoma (perithecium) with a pore (ostiole) at the top.\n* [[Ascocarp#Cleistothecium|Cleistothecia]]: The ascocarp (a cleistothecium) is spherical and closed.\n* [[Ascocarp#Apothecium|Apothecia]]: The asci are in a bowl shaped ascoma (apothecium). These are sometimes called the \"cup fungi\". \n* [[Ascocarp#Pseudothecium|Pseudothecia]]: Asci with two layers, produced in pseudothecia that look like perithecia. The ascospores are arranged irregularly.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.microscopemaster.com/ascomycota.html|title=Ascomycota - Characteristics, Nutrition and Significance|website=MicroscopeMaster|language=en|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref>\n\nThe sexual structures are formed in the fruiting layer of the ascocarp, the [[hymenium]]. At one end of ascogenous hyphae, characteristic U-shaped hooks develop, which curve back opposite to the growth direction of the hyphae. The two nuclei contained in the apical part of each hypha divide in such a way that the threads of their [[mitotic spindle]]s run parallel, creating two pairs of genetically different nuclei. One daughter nucleus migrates close to the hook, while the other daughter nucleus locates to the basal part of the hypha. The formation of two parallel cross-walls then divides the hypha into three sections: one at the hook with one nucleus, one at the basal of the original hypha that contains one nucleus, and one that separates the U-shaped part, which contains the other two nuclei.\n[[File:Ascocarp2.png|thumb|right|alt=Cross-section of a cup-shaped structure showing locations of developing meiotic asci (upper edge of cup, left side, arrows pointing to two gray-colored cells containing four and two small circles), sterile hyphae (upper edge of cup, right side, arrows pointing to white-colored cells with a single small circle in them), and mature asci (upper edge of cup, pointing to two gray-colored cells with eight small circles in them)|Diagram of an [[apothecium]] (the typical cup-like reproductive structure of Ascomycetes) showing sterile tissues as well as developing and mature asci.]]\n\nFusion of the nuclei (karyogamy) takes place in the U-shaped cells in the hymenium, and results in the formation of a diploid [[zygote]]. The zygote grows into the [[ascus]], an elongated tube-shaped or cylinder-shaped capsule. Meiosis then gives rise to four [[ploidy#Haploid and monoploid|haploid]] nuclei, usually followed by a further mitotic division that results in eight nuclei in each ascus. The nuclei along with some cytoplasma become enclosed within membranes and a cell wall to give rise to ascospores that are aligned inside the ascus like peas in a pod.\n\nUpon opening of the ascus, ascospores may be dispersed by the wind, while in some cases the spores are forcibly ejected form the ascus; certain species have evolved spore cannons, which can eject ascospores up to 30&nbsp;cm. away. When the spores reach a suitable substrate, they germinate, form new hyphae, which restarts the fungal life cycle.\n\nThe form of the ascus is important for classification and is divided into four basic types: unitunicate-operculate, unitunicate-inoperculate, bitunicate, or prototunicate. See the article on [[Ascus|asci]] for further details.\n\n== Ecology ==\nThe Ascomycota fulfil a central role in most land-based [[ecosystem]]s. They are important [[decomposer]]s, breaking down organic materials, such as dead leaves and animals, and helping the [[detritivore]]s (animals that feed on decomposing material) to obtain their nutrients. Ascomycetes along with other fungi can break down large [[Biopolymer|molecules]] such as [[cellulose]] or [[lignin]], and thus have important roles in nutrient cycling such as the [[carbon cycle]].\n\nThe fruiting bodies of the Ascomycota provide food for many animals ranging from [[insect]]s and slugs and snails (''[[Gastropoda]]'') to [[rodent]]s and larger mammals such as [[deer]] and [[wild boar]]s.\n\nMany ascomycetes also form [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationships with other organisms, including plants and animals.\n\n=== Lichens ===\n{{main|Lichen}}\nProbably since early in their evolutionary history, the Ascomycota have formed symbiotic associations with [[green algae]] (''Chlorophyta''), and other types of [[algae]] and [[cyanobacteria]]. These mutualistic associations are commonly known as [[lichen]]s, and can grow and persist in terrestrial regions of the earth that are inhospitable to other organisms and characterized by extremes in temperature and humidity, including the [[Arctic]], the [[Antarctic]], [[desert]]s, and mountaintops. While the [[photoautotroph]]ic algal partner generates metabolic energy through photosynthesis, the fungus offers a stable, supportive matrix and protects cells from radiation and dehydration. Around 42% of the Ascomycota (about 18,000 species) form lichens, and almost all the fungal partners of lichens belong to the Ascomycota.\n\n=== Mycorrhizal fungi and endophytes ===\nMembers of the Ascomycota form two important types of relationship with plants: as [[mycorrhiza]]l fungi and as [[endophyte]]s. Mycorrhiza are [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] associations of fungi with the root systems of the plants, which can be of vital importance for growth and persistence for the plant. The fine mycelial network of the fungus enables the increased uptake of mineral salts that occur at low levels in the soil. In return, the plant provides the fungus with metabolic energy in the form of [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] products.\n\nEndophytic fungi live inside plants, and those that form mutualistic or [[commensalism|commensal]] associations with their host, do not damage their hosts. The exact nature of the relationship between endophytic fungus and host depends on the species involved, and in some cases fungal colonization of plants can bestow a higher resistance against insects, [[roundworm]]s (nematodes), and [[bacteria]]; in the case of [[Neotyphodium|grass endophytes]] the fungal symbiont produces poisonous [[alkaloid]]s, which can affect the health of plant-eating (herbivorous) [[mammal]]s and deter or kill insect herbivores.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Schulz B, Boyle C.|year=2005 |title=The endophytic continuum |journal=Mycological Research |volume=109 |issue=6 |pages=661\u201386 |pmid=16080390 |doi= 10.1017/S095375620500273X |first1= B |last2= Boyle |first2= C}}</ref>\n\n=== Symbiotic relationships with animals ===\nSeveral ascomycetes of the genus ''[[Xylaria]]'' colonize the nests of [[leafcutter ant]]s and other [[fungus-growing ants]] of the tribe [[Attini]], and the fungal gardens of [[termite]]s (Isoptera). Since they do not generate fruiting bodies until the insects have left the nests, it is suspected that, as confirmed in several cases of [[Basidiomycota]] species, they may be cultivated.{{Clarify|this sentence is very confusing|date=September 2009}}\n\n[[Bark beetle]]s (family Scolytidae) are important symbiotic partners of ascomycetes. The female beetles transport fungal spores to new hosts in characteristic tucks in their skin, the ''[[mycetangia]]''. The beetle tunnels into the wood and into large chambers in which they lay their eggs. Spores released from the mycetangia germinate into hyphae, which can break down the wood. The beetle larvae then feed on the fungal mycelium, and, on reaching maturity, carry new spores with them to renew the cycle of infection. A well-known example of this is [[Dutch elm disease]], caused by ''[[Ophiostoma ulmi]]'', which is carried by the European elm bark beetle, ''[[Scolytus multistriatus]]''.<ref name=\"Moser 2010\">{{cite journal |author1=Moser, J.C. |author2=Konrad, H. |author3=Blomquist, S.R. |author4=Kirisits, T. |year=2010 |title=Do mites phoretic on elm bark beetles contribute to the transmission of Dutch elm disease? |journal=Naturwissenschaften |volume=97 |issue=2 |pages=219\u2013227 |doi=10.1007/s00114-009-0630-x |pmid=19967528|bibcode=2010NW.....97..219M |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1232603 }}</ref>\n\n=== Plant disease interactions ===\nOne of their most harmful roles is as the agent of many plant diseases. For instance:\n\n* [[Dutch Elm Disease]], caused by the closely related species ''Ophiostoma ulmi'' and ''Ophiostoma novo-ulmi'', has led to the death of many elms in Europe and North America.\n* The originally Asian [[Chestnut blight|''Cryphonectria parasitica'']] is responsible for attacking Sweet Chestnuts (''[[Castanea sativa]]''), and virtually eliminated the once-widespread [[American Chestnut]] (''Castanea dentata''),\n* A disease of [[maize]] (''Zea mays''), which is especially prevalent in North America, is brought about by ''[[Cochliobolus heterostrophus]]''.\n* ''[[Taphrina deformans]]'' causes [[leaf curl]] of peach.\n* ''[[Uncinula necator]]'' is responsible for the disease [[powdery mildew]], which attacks grapevines.\n* Species of ''[[Monilinia]]'' cause brown rot of stone fruit such as peaches (''Prunus persica'') and sour cherries (''Prunus ceranus'').\n* Members of the Ascomycota such as ''[[Stachybotrys chartarum]]'' are responsible for fading of woolen textiles, which is a common problem especially in the tropics.\n* Blue-green, red and brown [[mold]]s attack and spoil foodstuffs - for instance ''[[Penicillium italicum]]'' rots oranges.\n* Cereals infected with ''[[Fusarium graminearum]]'' contain [[mycotoxin]]s like [[deoxynivalenol]] (DON), which causes [[Fusarium ear blight]] and skin and mucous membrane lesions when eaten by pigs.\n\n=== Human disease interactions ===\n\n* ''[[Aspergillus fumigatus]]'', the most common cause of fungal infection in the lungs of immune compromised patients often resulting in death. Also the most frequent cause of [[Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis]], which often occurs in patients with [[Cystic fibrosis]] as well as [[Asthma]]. \n* ''[[Candida albicans]]'', a yeast that attacks the mucous membranes, can cause an infection of the mouth or vagina called thrush or [[candidiasis]], and is also blamed for \"yeast allergies\".\n* Fungi like ''[[Epidermophyton]]'' cause skin infections but are not very dangerous for people with healthy immune systems. However, if the immune system is damaged they can be life-threatening; for instance, ''[[Pneumocystis jirovecii]]'' is responsible for severe lung infections that occur in [[AIDS]] patients.\n* [[Ergot]] (''Claviceps purpurea'') is a direct menace to humans when it attacks wheat or rye and produces highly poisonous [[alkaloid]]s, causing [[ergotism]] if consumed. Symptoms include hallucinations, stomach cramps, and a burning sensation in the limbs (\"[[Ergotism|Saint Anthony's Fire]]\").\n* ''[[Aspergillus flavus]]'', which grows on peanuts and other hosts, generates [[aflatoxin]], which damages the liver and is highly carcinogenic.\n\n=== Beneficial effects for humans ===\nOn the other hand, ascus fungi have brought some important benefits to humanity.\n* The most famous case may be that of the mould ''[[Penicillium chrysogenum]]'' (formerly ''Penicillium notatum''), which, probably to attack competing bacteria, produces an antibiotic that, under the name of [[penicillin]], triggered a revolution in the treatment of bacterial infectious diseases in the 20th century.\n* The medical importance of ''[[Tolypocladium niveum]]'' as an [[immunosuppression|immunosuppressor]] can hardly be exaggerated. It excretes [[Ciclosporin]], which, as well as being given during [[Organ transplantation]] to prevent rejection, is also prescribed for auto-immune diseases such as [[multiple sclerosis]], although there is some doubt over the long-term side-effects of the treatment.\n[[File:Blue Stilton Quarter Front.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Stilton cheese veined with ''Penicillium roqueforti'']]\n* Some ascomycete fungi can be altered relatively easily through [[genetic engineering]] procedures. They can then produce useful proteins such as [[insulin]], [[human growth hormone]], or TPa, which is employed to dissolve blood clots.\n* Several species are common [[model organism]]s in biology, including ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'', ''[[Schizosaccharomyces pombe]]'', and ''[[Neurospora crassa]]''. The [[genome]]s of a number of ascomycete fungi have been fully sequenced.\n* Baker's Yeast (''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'') is used to make [[bread]], [[beer]] and [[wine]], during which process sugars such as [[glucose]] or [[sucrose]] are fermented to make [[ethanol]] and [[carbon dioxide]]. Bakers use the yeast for carbon dioxide production, causing the bread to rise, with the ethanol boiling off during cooking. Most vintners use it for ethanol production, with the carbon dioxide being released into the atmosphere during fermentation. Brewers and traditional producers of [[sparkling wine]] use both, with a primary fermentation for the alcohol and a secondary one to produce the carbon dioxide bubbles that provide the drinks with \"sparkling\" texture in the case of wine and the desirable foam in the case of beer.\n* Enzymes of ''[[Penicillium camemberti]]'' play a role in the manufacture of the cheeses [[Camembert]] and [[Brie]], while those of ''[[Penicillium roqueforti]]'' do the same for [[Gorgonzola (cheese)|Gorgonzola]], [[Roquefort]] and [[Stilton cheese|Stilton]].\n* In Asia, ''[[Aspergillus oryzae]]'' is added to a pulp of soaked soya beans to make [[soy sauce]], and is used to break down starch in rice and other grains into simple sugars for fermentation into East Asian alcoholic beverages such as [[huangjiu]] and [[sake]].\n* Finally, some members of the Ascomycota are choice edibles; [[Morchella|morel]]s (''Morchella spp.''), [[truffle]]s (''Tuber spp.''), and [[Hypomyces lactifluorum|lobster mushroom]] (''Hypomyces lactifluorum'') are some of the most sought-after fungal delicacies.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Ascomycota families incertae sedis|List of Ascomycota families ''incertae sedis'']]\n* [[List of Ascomycota genera incertae sedis|List of Ascomycota genera ''incertae sedis'']]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Cited texts ==\n{{Wikispecies|Ascomycota}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last=Alexopoulos |first=C.J. |last2=Mims |first2=C.W. |last3=Blackwell |first3=M. | title=Introductory Mycology | year=1996 | publisher=Wiley | isbn=0-471-52229-5 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Deacon |first=J. |title=Fungal Biology |publisher=Blackwell |year=2005 |isbn=1-4051-3066-0 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |vauthors=Jennings DH, Lysek G |title=Fungal Biology: Understanding the Fungal Lifestyle|year=1996 |publisher=Bios Scientific |location=Guildford, UK |isbn=978-1-85996-150-6}}\n* {{cite book |vauthors=Kirk PM, Cannon PF, Minter DW, Stalpers JA |title=Dictionary of the Fungi |edition=10th |publisher=CABI |location=Wallingford |year=2008|isbn=978-0-85199-826-8}}\n* {{cite book |vauthors=Taylor EL, Taylor TN |title=The Biology and Evolution of Fossil Plants |publisher=Prentice Hall  |year=1993 |isbn=0-13-651589-4}}\n{{refend}}\n\n{{Eukaryota classification}}\n{{Fungi classification}}\n{{Life on Earth}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q174726}}\n\n[[Category:Mycology]]\n[[Category:Ascomycota| ]]\n[[Category:Fungus phyla]]\n", "name_user": "WolfmanSF", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascomycota"}

Other misquotations include \"[[Just the facts, ma'am]]\" (attributed to [[Jack Webb]]'s character of [[Joe Friday]] on ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''), \"Heavy lies the crown\" from Shakespeare's Play [[Henry IV, Part 2]], \"[[Sherlock Holmes#\"Elementary, my dear Watson\"|Elementary, my dear Watson]]\" (attributed to [[Sherlock Holmes]]; it was, however, said in the films ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' and ''[[The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1929 film)|The Return of Sherlock Holmes]]''), \"[[Luke, I am your father]]\" (attributed to [[Darth Vader]] in [[Star Wars]]), \"[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Play it again, Sam]]\" (attributed to Ilsa in ''[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Casablanca]]''), \"[[Do you feel lucky, punk?]]\" (attributed to [[Dirty Harry (character)|Harry Callahan]] in ''[[Dirty Harry]]'') and \"[[Stinking badges|We don't need no stinkin' badges!]]\" (attributed to Gold Hat in ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'').<ref>The Holmes phrase originated in a radio play.

It can trigger inversion of the verb and the verb's [[subject]]. Subject-verb inversion occurs most often in written works, being rare in speech.<ref name=\"collins\">{{cite journal |last1=Collins |first1=Chris |last2=Branigan |first2=Phil |title=Quotative Inversion |journal=Natural Language & Linguistic Theory |date=February 1997 |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=1\u201341 |doi=10.1023/A:1005722729974 }}</ref> Quotations may appear before the inverted verb, but can also appear after the subject,<ref name=\"bruening\">{{cite journal |last1=Bruening |first1=Benjamin |title=Alignment in Syntax: Quotative Inversion in English |journal=Syntax |date=15 April 2016 |volume=19 |issue=2 |page=113 |doi=10.1111/synt.12121 }}</ref> such as: ''\"I am going to follow you all the rest of my life,\" declared the man'' <ref name=\"bruening\"/> and ''Said the woman: \"I see you with both my eyes.\"''<ref name=\"bruening\"/>\n\n====Syntax====\nIn syntactic terms, these direct quotations can be presented in two forms. The first is as the [[complement (linguistics)|complement]] of a quotative verb (e.g. Marie said: \"My brother has arrived\"), and the second being as a head clause with a quotative [[adjunct (grammar)|adjunct]] (e.g. \"My brother has arrived\", Marie announces).<ref name=\"sdq bonami\">{{cite web |last1=Bonami |first1=Olivier |last2=Godard |first2=Dani\u00e8le |title=On the Syntax of Direct Quotation in French | date=2008 | url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00751080/document |website=HAL |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> The [[verb phrase]] can be further expanded to include a complement, such as: \"They'll never make it!\" cried John ''to Mary''. Subjects must precede the complement, otherwise the structure formed will be ungrammatical (e.g. *\"They'll never make it!\" cried ''to Mary'' John).<ref name=\"collins\"/> Quotative inversion is only allowed when the verb is in the [[simple present]] or the [[simple past]]. The most common pairing is the verb ''said'' with a [[nominal (linguistics)|nominal]] subject, such as: \"That's the whole trouble,\" said Gwen.<ref name=\"anna\">{{cite journal |last1=Cichosz |first1=Anna |title=Parenthetical reporting clauses in the history of English: the development of quotative inversion |journal=English Language and Linguistics |date=March 2019 |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=183\u2013214 |doi=10.1017/S1360674317000594 |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/english-language-and-linguistics/article/parenthetical-reporting-clauses-in-the-history-of-english-the-development-of-quotative-inversion/D9796FA7297499AFD9B021EEA1A6F56C |accessdate=17 April 2020}}</ref> Additionally, [[noun phrase|noun phrases]] are not permitted in addition to the subject when inversion takes place.<ref name=\"collins\"/> They are allowed only when there is no subject-verb inversion, or when part of a preposition phrase.<ref name=\"bruening\"/>\n:: a. \"Why?\" Gabrielle asked the attendant.<ref name=\"bruening\"/> - <small>No subject-verb inversion</small>\n:: b. \"Why?\" asked Gabrielle of the attendant.<ref name=\"bruening\"/> - <small>NP part of a preposition phrase</small>\n:: c.

Instead, they convey the approximative meaning of such an utterance along with the way in which that utterance was produced. From a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] perspective, a quotation in spoken discourse can therefore also be defined as \u201ca performance whereby speakers re-enact previous behaviour (speech/thought/sound/voice effect and gesture) while assuming the dramatic role of the original source of this reported behaviour\u201d.<ref name=\"buch\">{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, quotations\u2014more specifically known as direct quotations<ref name=\"clark\" />\u2014have been distinguished from indirect quotations. Direct quotations differ from indirect quotations in that they are reported from the perspective of the experiencer, while indirect quotations are reported from the perspective of the reporting speaker (e.g. \"He said: 'I am leaving now'\u201d versus \"He said (that) he was leaving immediately\"); are free in their syntactic form, while indirect quotations are subject to language-specific structural requirements (e.g. indirect quotations in many [[Indo-European languages]] are required to have the syntactic form of a [[Well-formedness|well-formed]] declarative [[dependent clause|subordinate clause]]); incorporate extralinguistic material and pragmatic markers, while indirect quotations do not. Crucially, direct quotations have a performative aspect (i.e. occur simultaneously with re-enactments of previous behaviours), which indirect quotations lack.<ref name=\"buch\" /><ref name=\"clark\">{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |jstor=414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Reasons for using===\n\nQuotations are employed in spoken discourse for many reasons. They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutors]]. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example, while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example, two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future and propose what they would say. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref name=\"jessie\">{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said. Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; quotations demonstrate something that someone said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker\u2019s feelings about what was said.<ref name=\"jessie\" /><ref name=\"clark\" /> In this way, quotations are an especially effective storytelling device; the speaker is able to give a voice to the protagonists in their stories themselves, which allows the speaker\u2019s audience to experience the situation in the way that the speaker themselves experienced it.<ref name=\"buch\" />\n\n===Form===\n\nIn most languages, quotations in spoken discourse are introduced by a [[verbum dicendi|verb of saying]] and a [[pronoun]]. For example, a quotation in English can be introduced by \u201cShe said\u201d. In some languages, there is a [[discourse marker]] in addition to the verb of saying that functions as verbal quotation marks.<ref name=\"tracy\">{{cite book |authorlink1=Quotatives |editor1-last=Tracy |editor1-first=Karen |title=The international encyclopedia of language and social interaction |date=2015 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9781118611463 |pages=1272\u20131276}}</ref> For example, Japanese uses the quotative particle (a type of quotative marker) ''to'' along with the [[grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] verb of saying ''itta'':\n\nGloss: TOP=Topic Marker DAT=Dative NOM=Nominative COM=complementizer\n\n: {| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u3086\u304d || \u306f || \u3042\u306a\u305f\u3000|| \u306b\u306f || \u5f7c\u5973 || \u304c || \u597d\u304d || '''\u3068''' || '''\u8a00\u3063\u305f'''\u3002<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n|-\n| Yuki || wa || anata|| ni wa || kanocho || ga || suki || '''to''' || '''itta'''.\n|-\n| Yuki|| TOP || you || DAT || her || NOM || like || COM || said\n|-\n| colspan=9|\"''Yuki said that you liked her.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying (known as quotative verbs when used to introduce quotations) and quotative particles are used as quotative markers, which signal quotations in utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> Quotative evidentials are also used in some languages to indicate quoted speech (e.g. [[Cusco Quechua|Cusco Quechua]] spoken in Peru, [[Nanti language|Nanti]] spoken in lowland southeastern Peru, [[Laal language|Laal]] spoken in Chad).<ref name=\"quechua\">{{cite journal |last1=Korotkova |first1=Natasha |title=Evidentials and (relayed) speech acts: hearsay as quotation |journal=Proceedings of SALT 25 |date=2017 |pages=676\u2013694 |doi=10.3765/salt.v25i0.3969}}</ref><ref name=\"nanti\">{{cite book |editor1-last=LaPolla |editor1-first=Randy |editor2-last=De Busser |editor2-first=Rik |title=Language Structure and Environment |date=2015 |publisher=John Benjamins |pages=99\u2013103}}</ref><ref name=\"laal\">{{cite web |last1=Lionnet |first1=Florian |title=More than reported speech: Quotative evidentiality in Laal |url=http://www.princeton.edu/~flionnet/papers/Lionnet-WOCAL-Laal-evidential.pdf |accessdate=19 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Quotative markers====\nQuotative markers are used to mark a section of an utterance as quoted speech (i.e. a quotation). In oral speech, quotative markers act as quotation marks and often include a verb of saying (e.g. ''say''). A quotative marker usually appears either before or after the reported speech or thought, depending on the [[syntax]] of the language.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> For example, compare the following languages:\n\n=====English=====\n\nIn English, the quotative verb ''say'' occurs before the quotation:<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n:: a.

Like ''to'' and ''iu'' (say),  ''to'' and ''omou'' occur after the quotation.\n\n=====Laal=====\n\nIn [[Laal language|Laal]], the quotative evidential ''m\u0268\u0301'' is used for non-self quotation<ref name=\"laal\"/> (i.e. quotation in which the speaker quotes someone else, not themself); it is used with a quotative verb ''\u0253\u0268\u0301l\u00e1''. The use of ''m\u0268\u0301'' results in an indirect quotation translation. The quotative verb ''b\u0268\u0301l\u00e1'' occurs before the quotation, while the quotative evidential ''m\u0268\u0301'' occurs within the quoted speech ''j\u00e1 m\u0268\u0301 ny\u00e0g t\u0101\u0101 w\u00f3'':\n\nGloss: QEV=Quotative Evidential NEG=Negation\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u00e0<sub>i</sub> || '''\u0253\u0268\u0301l\u00e1''' || m\u0268\u0301\u3000|| j\u00e1<sub>*i/j</sub> || '''m\u0268\u0301''' || ny\u00e0g || t\u0101\u0101 || w\u00f3 <ref name=\"laal\"/>\n|-\n| He || '''say''' || (say)that || I || '''QEV''' || eat || fish || NEG\n|-\n| colspan=8|\"''He<sub>i</sub> said that I<sub>*i/j</sub> don't/didn't eat fish.''\"\n|}\n\nAs the above sentence involves a non-self quotation, ''\u00e0'' (he) and ''j\u00e1'' (I) have different indices to show that they refer to different [[referent|referents]]; only this interpretation is [[well-formedness|well-formed]]. The interpretation in which they share identical indices is ill-formed (i.e. ungrammatical), as indicated by the asterisk.\n\n\nIn addition to quotative markers, speakers also use [[prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] shifts, pauses, pronominal choices, and [[grammatical tense|tense]] to detect the occurrence and boundaries of quotations in spoken utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n===Syntax===\nDifferent versions of quotative verbs, particles, and evidentials can be used to express the same idea with varying nuances, often to frame how the primary speaker, or the person who is quoting, feels about a quotation. The syntax of quotations varies cross-linguistically. A primary speaker may use the tense and linguistic idiosyncrasies of the speech at the time it was uttered in a quotation, independent from the tense in the main clause in some languages, or use the same tense in both the main clause and quotation in other languages. They will also use [[coreference]]d pronouns to the direct quotation's first-person subject in the main clause: She<sub>x</sub> said, \"I<sub>x</sub>...\"; they<sub>y</sub> said \"we<sub>y</sub> ...\" In many languages, the primary speaker may also attempt to quote an utterance in the same language the original speaker used, even if an interlocutor does not understand it; however, it is mainly context-dependent such as when telling stories.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\">{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Nicholas |title=Canonical Morphology and Syntax |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Some problems in the typology of quotation: a canonical approach}}</ref><ref name=\"Klamer report\">{{cite journal |last1=Klamer |first1=Marian |title=How report verbs become quote markers and complementisers |journal=Lingua |date=2000 |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=69\u201398 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3841(99)00032-7|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384199000327 | accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"DarcyA Review\">{{cite journal |last1=D'Arcy |first1=Alexandra |title=Quotation and advances in understanding syntactic systems |journal=Annual Review of Linguistics |date=2015 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=43\u201361 |doi=10.1146/annurev-linguist-030514-125220}}</ref>\n\n====Quotative verbs====\nQuotative verbs are lexical verbs that indicate the speech, thoughts, or perceptions of the original speaker.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\"/><ref name=\"Klamer report\"/>\n\nQuotations can be introduced as the complement to a quotative verb or as the head phrase to an adjunct phrase containing a quotative verb in some languages like English and French.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/><ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ||Quotation as complement || Quotation as head phrase adjunct <ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/>\n|-\n| English || Marie said, \u201cMy brother has arrived.\u201d || \u201cMy brother has arrived,\" Marie said.\n|-\n| French || Marie a dit, \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9.\u201d || \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9,\" comme a dit Marie.\n|}\nEnglish also displays [[verb-second]] (V2) order vestige only in quotation contexts (quotative inversion), requiring the finite verb to appear in the second position of a clause. For example: \"No no no\" ''says'' Harry.<ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n\nDirect and indirect quotations are sometimes not distinguishable. Traditionally, English uses an overt complementizer ''that'' after a quotative verb to indicate indirect quotation, but it is also seen to prompt direct quotation in some English varieties like Indian English, Hong Kong English, and Kenyan English.\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Hong Kong English || After the movie I just '''said that''' \"Oh Frank I cannot walk.\" <ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n|-\n| Indian English || Never a husband '''says that''' \"I'll make a cup of tea okay, you sit.

''Be like'' includes the use of the demonstrative ''that'', which is null in most English varieties, but can be optionally overt in some varieties like Glasgow English. Dutch's quotative verb ''hebben zoiets van'' has a similar structure to Standard American English in that it has a null demonstrative that precedes the quotation.

In written text, quotations are signaled by quotation marks.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\">{{cite web |last1=Bonami |first1=Olivier |last2=Godard |first2=Dani\u00e8le |title=On the Syntax of Direct Quotation in French | date=2008 | url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00751080/document |website=HAL |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> Quotations are also used to present well-known statement parts that are explicitly attributed by [[citation]] to their original source; such statements are marked with ([[punctuation|punctuated]] with) [[quotation mark]]s.\n\nQuotations are often used as a literary device to represent someone's point of view. They are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay.\n\n==As a literary device==\nA quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a [[painting]], scenes from a [[film|movie]] or sections from a [[musical composition]].\n\n===Reasons for using===\nQuotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or [[author]], to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-using-quotes/|title=English Grammar Lesson - Using Quotes! - ELC|date=2016-11-16|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader. Pragmatically speaking, quotations can also be used as language games (in the Wittgensteinian sense of the term) to manipulate social order and the structure of society.<ref>Capone, A., & Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2014). On indirect reports and language games: Evidence from Persian. Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 8(2), 26-42.</ref><ref>Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2015). The secret life of slurs from the perspective of reported speech. Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 9(2), 92-112.</ref>\n\n===Common sources===\nFamous quotations are frequently collected in books that are sometimes called quotation dictionaries or treasuries.  Of these, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', ''The [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] Dictionary of Quotations'', ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' and ''The [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.  Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines\u2014with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics\u2014have also become commonplace.\n\n===Misquotations===\n{{further|False attribution}}\n{{See also|List of movie misquotes}}\nMany quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.<ref>See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe ''Star Trek'' catchphrase \"[[Beam me up, Scotty]]\" did not appear in that form in the original series. Other misquotations include \"[[Just the facts, ma'am]]\" (attributed to [[Jack Webb]]'s character of [[Joe Friday]] on ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''), \"Heavy lies the crown\" from Shakespeare's Play [[Henry IV, Part 2]], \"[[Sherlock Holmes#\"Elementary, my dear Watson\"|Elementary, my dear Watson]]\" (attributed to [[Sherlock Holmes]]; it was, however, said in the films ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' and ''[[The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1929 film)|The Return of Sherlock Holmes]]''), \"[[Luke, I am your father]]\" (attributed to [[Darth Vader]] in [[Star Wars]]), \"[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Play it again, Sam]]\" (attributed to Ilsa in ''[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Casablanca]]''), \"[[Do you feel lucky, punk?]]\" (attributed to [[Dirty Harry (character)|Harry Callahan]] in ''[[Dirty Harry]]'') and \"[[Stinking badges|We don't need no stinkin' badges!]]\" (attributed to Gold Hat in ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'').<ref>The Holmes phrase originated in a radio play.

It can trigger inversion of the verb and the verb's [[subject]]. Subject-verb inversion occurs most often in written works, being rare in speech.<ref name=\"collins\">{{cite journal |last1=Collins |first1=Chris |last2=Branigan |first2=Phil |title=Quotative Inversion |journal=Natural Language & Linguistic Theory |date=February 1997 |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=1\u201341 |doi=10.1023/A:1005722729974 }}</ref> Quotations may appear before the inverted verb, but can also appear after the subject,<ref name=\"bruening\">{{cite journal |last1=Bruening |first1=Benjamin |title=Alignment in Syntax: Quotative Inversion in English |journal=Syntax |date=15 April 2016 |volume=19 |issue=2 |page=113 |doi=10.1111/synt.12121 }}</ref> such as: ''\"I am going to follow you all the rest of my life,\" declared the man'' <ref name=\"bruening\"/> and ''Said the woman: \"I see you with both my eyes.\"''<ref name=\"bruening\"/>\n\n====Syntax====\nIn syntactic terms, these direct quotations can be presented in two forms. The first is as the [[complement (linguistics)|complement]] of a quotative verb (e.g. Marie said: \"My brother has arrived\"), and the second being as a head clause with a quotative [[adjunct (grammar)|adjunct]] (e.g. \"My brother has arrived\", Marie announces).<ref name=\"sdq bonami\">{{cite web |last1=Bonami |first1=Olivier |last2=Godard |first2=Dani\u00e8le |title=On the Syntax of Direct Quotation in French | date=2008 | url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00751080/document |website=HAL |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> The [[verb phrase]] can be further expanded to include a complement, such as: \"They'll never make it!\" cried John ''to Mary''. Subjects must precede the complement, otherwise the structure formed will be ungrammatical (e.g. *\"They'll never make it!\" cried ''to Mary'' John).<ref name=\"collins\"/> Quotative inversion is only allowed when the verb is in the [[simple present]] or the [[simple past]]. The most common pairing is the verb ''said'' with a [[nominal (linguistics)|nominal]] subject, such as: \"That's the whole trouble,\" said Gwen.<ref name=\"anna\">{{cite journal |last1=Cichosz |first1=Anna |title=Parenthetical reporting clauses in the history of English: the development of quotative inversion |journal=English Language and Linguistics |date=March 2019 |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=183\u2013214 |doi=10.1017/S1360674317000594 |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/english-language-and-linguistics/article/parenthetical-reporting-clauses-in-the-history-of-english-the-development-of-quotative-inversion/D9796FA7297499AFD9B021EEA1A6F56C |accessdate=17 April 2020}}</ref> Additionally, [[noun phrase|noun phrases]] are not permitted in addition to the subject when inversion takes place.<ref name=\"collins\"/> They are allowed only when there is no subject-verb inversion, or when part of a preposition phrase.<ref name=\"bruening\"/>\n:: a. \"Why?\" Gabrielle asked the attendant.<ref name=\"bruening\"/> - <small>No subject-verb inversion</small>\n:: b. \"Why?\" asked Gabrielle of the attendant.<ref name=\"bruening\"/> - <small>NP part of a preposition phrase</small>\n:: c.

Instead, they convey the approximative meaning of such an utterance along with the way in which that utterance was produced. From a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] perspective, a quotation in spoken discourse can therefore also be defined as \u201ca performance whereby speakers re-enact previous behaviour (speech/thought/sound/voice effect and gesture) while assuming the dramatic role of the original source of this reported behaviour\u201d.<ref name=\"buch\">{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, quotations\u2014more specifically known as direct quotations<ref name=\"clark\" />\u2014have been distinguished from indirect quotations. Direct quotations differ from indirect quotations in that they are reported from the perspective of the experiencer, while indirect quotations are reported from the perspective of the reporting speaker (e.g. \"He said: 'I am leaving now'\u201d versus \"He said (that) he was leaving immediately\"); are free in their syntactic form, while indirect quotations are subject to language-specific structural requirements (e.g. indirect quotations in many [[Indo-European languages]] are required to have the syntactic form of a [[Well-formedness|well-formed]] declarative [[dependent clause|subordinate clause]]); incorporate extralinguistic material and pragmatic markers, while indirect quotations do not. Crucially, direct quotations have a performative aspect (i.e. occur simultaneously with re-enactments of previous behaviours), which indirect quotations lack.<ref name=\"buch\" /><ref name=\"clark\">{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |jstor=414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Reasons for using===\n\nQuotations are employed in spoken discourse for many reasons. They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutors]]. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example, while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example, two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future and propose what they would say. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref name=\"jessie\">{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said. Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; quotations demonstrate something that someone said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker\u2019s feelings about what was said.<ref name=\"jessie\" /><ref name=\"clark\" /> In this way, quotations are an especially effective storytelling device; the speaker is able to give a voice to the protagonists in their stories themselves, which allows the speaker\u2019s audience to experience the situation in the way that the speaker themselves experienced it.<ref name=\"buch\" />\n\n===Form===\n\nIn most languages, quotations in spoken discourse are introduced by a [[verbum dicendi|verb of saying]] and a [[pronoun]]. For example, a quotation in English can be introduced by \u201cShe said\u201d.

A quotative marker usually appears either before or after the reported speech or thought, depending on the [[syntax]] of the language.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> For example, compare the following languages:\n\n=====English=====\n\nIn English, the quotative verb ''say'' occurs before the quotation:<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n:: a.

Like ''to'' and ''iu'' (say),  ''to'' and ''omou'' occur after the quotation.\n\n=====Laal=====\n\nIn [[Laal language|Laal]], the quotative evidential ''m\u0268\u0301'' is used for non-self quotation<ref name=\"laal\"/> (i.e. quotation in which the speaker quotes someone else, not themself); it is used with a quotative verb ''\u0253\u0268\u0301l\u00e1''. The use of ''m\u0268\u0301'' results in an indirect quotation translation. The quotative verb ''b\u0268\u0301l\u00e1'' occurs before the quotation, while the quotative evidential ''m\u0268\u0301'' occurs within the quoted speech ''j\u00e1 m\u0268\u0301 ny\u00e0g t\u0101\u0101 w\u00f3'':\n\nGloss: QEV=Quotative Evidential NEG=Negation\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u00e0<sub>i</sub> || '''\u0253\u0268\u0301l\u00e1''' || m\u0268\u0301\u3000|| j\u00e1<sub>*i/j</sub> || '''m\u0268\u0301''' || ny\u00e0g || t\u0101\u0101 || w\u00f3 <ref name=\"laal\"/>\n|-\n| He || '''say''' || (say)that || I || '''QEV''' || eat || fish || NEG\n|-\n| colspan=8|\"''He<sub>i</sub> said that I<sub>*i/j</sub> don't/didn't eat fish.''\"\n|}\n\nAs the above sentence involves a non-self quotation, ''\u00e0'' (he) and ''j\u00e1'' (I) have different indices to show that they refer to different [[referent|referents]]; only this interpretation is [[well-formedness|well-formed]]. The interpretation in which they share identical indices is ill-formed (i.e. ungrammatical), as indicated by the asterisk.\n\n\nIn addition to quotative markers, speakers also use [[prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] shifts, pauses, pronominal choices, and [[grammatical tense|tense]] to detect the occurrence and boundaries of quotations in spoken utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n===Syntax===\nDifferent versions of quotative verbs, particles, and evidentials can be used to express the same idea with varying nuances, often to frame how the primary speaker, or the person who is quoting, feels about a quotation. The syntax of quotations varies cross-linguistically. A primary speaker may use the tense and linguistic idiosyncrasies of the speech at the time it was uttered in a quotation, independent from the tense in the main clause in some languages, or use the same tense in both the main clause and quotation in other languages. They will also use [[coreference]]d pronouns to the direct quotation's first-person subject in the main clause: She<sub>x</sub> said, \"I<sub>x</sub>...\"; they<sub>y</sub> said \"we<sub>y</sub> ...\" In many languages, the primary speaker may also attempt to quote an utterance in the same language the original speaker used, even if an interlocutor does not understand it; however, it is mainly context-dependent such as when telling stories.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\">{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Nicholas |title=Canonical Morphology and Syntax |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Some problems in the typology of quotation: a canonical approach}}</ref><ref name=\"Klamer report\">{{cite journal |last1=Klamer |first1=Marian |title=How report verbs become quote markers and complementisers |journal=Lingua |date=2000 |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=69\u201398 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3841(99)00032-7|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384199000327 | accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"DarcyA Review\">{{cite journal |last1=D'Arcy |first1=Alexandra |title=Quotation and advances in understanding syntactic systems |journal=Annual Review of Linguistics |date=2015 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=43\u201361 |doi=10.1146/annurev-linguist-030514-125220}}</ref>\n\n====Quotative verbs====\nQuotative verbs are lexical verbs that indicate the speech, thoughts, or perceptions of the original speaker.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\"/><ref name=\"Klamer report\"/>\n\nQuotations can be introduced as the complement to a quotative verb or as the head phrase to an adjunct phrase containing a quotative verb in some languages like English and French.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/><ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ||Quotation as complement || Quotation as head phrase adjunct <ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/>\n|-\n| English || Marie said, \u201cMy brother has arrived.\u201d || \u201cMy brother has arrived,\" Marie said.\n|-\n| French || Marie a dit, \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9.\u201d || \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9,\" comme a dit Marie.\n|}\nEnglish also displays [[verb-second]] (V2) order vestige only in quotation contexts (quotative inversion), requiring the finite verb to appear in the second position of a clause. For example: \"No no no\" ''says'' Harry.<ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n\nDirect and indirect quotations are sometimes not distinguishable. Traditionally, English uses an overt complementizer ''that'' after a quotative verb to indicate indirect quotation, but it is also seen to prompt direct quotation in some English varieties like Indian English, Hong Kong English, and Kenyan English.\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Hong Kong English || After the movie I just '''said that''' \"Oh Frank I cannot walk.\" <ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n|-\n| Indian English || Never a husband '''says that''' \"I'll make a cup of tea okay, you sit. I'll make a cup of tea.\"\n|-\n| Kenyan English || So Kabuwe Abuwe '''told''' us '''that''' \"If it is for wedding I am not going to contribute.\"\n|}\n\nThe newer quotative verb ''be like'' in English is used to only introduce direct quotations. ''Be like'' includes the use of the demonstrative ''that'', which is null in most English varieties, but can be optionally overt in some varieties like Glasgow English. Dutch's quotative verb ''hebben zoiets van'' has a similar structure to Standard American English in that it has a null demonstrative that precedes the quotation. It differs from the English structures in that it uses an overt quantifier ''zoiets'' to be [[grammaticality|well-formed]].<ref name=\"haddican et al\">{{cite journal |last1=Haddican |first1=William |last2=Zweig |first2=Eytan |last3=Johnson |first3=Daniel Ezra |title=The syntax of be like quotatives |journal=Proceedings of the 29th West Coast Conference on Formal Linguistics |date=2012 |page=81-89 |url=http://www.lingref.com/cpp/wccfl/29/paper2690.pdf}}</ref>\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Languages indicate this in various ways: through grammatical marking, additional words and phrases, prosody, gestures, or systematic affixes of verbs. Quotative readings of evidentials are typologically rare. For example, English can express evidentials with an optional adverb, \"''Allegedly'', Annie pulled the trigger.\" The interlocutor then knows  the source of the quotation is from elsewhere, but this is not a quotative reading as there is no direct performative quoting or verbs of saying. Languages including Cusco Quechua, Kham, Tagalog, and Kaalallisut are documented as containing quotative evidentials.

The first roller skate was effectively an ice skate with wheels dad come back home I really miss you please come back replacing the blade. Later the \"quad\" style of roller skate became more popular consisting of four wheels arranged in the same configuration as a typical [[automobile|car]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:The Childrens Museum of Indianapolis -Roller Skates.jpg|thumbnail|right|A pair of roller skates within the permanent collection of [[The Children's Museum of Indianapolis]]. Skates like these fit over shoes and were adjustable.]]\n\nWhile the first reported use of roller skates was on a London stage in 1743, the first [[patent]]ed roller skate was introduced in 1760 by Belgian inventor [[John Joseph Merlin]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Foot and ankle sports orthopaedics|others=Valderrabano, Victor,, Easley, Mark E.|isbn=3319157345|location=Cham, Switzerland|oclc=972330993}}</ref> His roller skate wasn't much more than an [[ice skate]] with wheels where the blade goes, a style we would call inline today. They were hard to steer and hard to stop because they didn't have brakes and, as such, were not very popular. The initial \"test piloting\" of the first prototype of the skate was in the city of [[Huy]], which had a party with Merlin playing the [[violin]].\n\nIn the 1840s, Meyerbeer's opera ''[[Le proph\u00e8te]]'' featured a scene in which performers used roller-skates to simulate ice-skating on a frozen lake set on stage. The result was to popularize roller skating throughout the Continent. As ice skaters subsequently developed the art of figure skating, roller skaters wanted the ability to turn in their skates in a similar fashion.<ref>Wilson, David Gordon (2004). ''Bicycling Science'', 3rd Edition. MIT Press.</ref>\n\nIn 1863, [[James Leonard Plimpton|James Plimpton]] from Massachusetts invented the \"rocking\" skate and used a four-wheel configuration for stability, and independent axles that turned by pressing to one side of the skate or the other when the skater wants to create an edge. This was a vast improvement on the Merlin design, one that was easier to use and drove the huge popularity of [[roller skating]], dubbed  \"rinkomania\" in the 1860s and 1870s,<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-31831110 \"The Victorian craze that sparked a mini-sexual revolution\"], [[BBC News]], 6 April 2015</ref> which spread to Europe and around the world, and continued through the 1930s. The Plimpton skate is still used today.\n\nEventually, roller skating evolved from just a pastime to a competitive [[sport]]; [[Inline speed skating|speed skating]], racing on skates, and [[inline figure skating]], very similar to what can be seen in the Olympics on ice. In the mid 1990s [[roller hockey]], played with a ball rather than a puck, became so popular that it even made an appearance in the [[Olympic Games|Olympics]] in 1992. The National Sporting Goods Association statistics showed, from a 1999 study, that 2.5 million people played roller hockey. Roller skating was considered for the 2012 Summer Olympics<ref>http://www.skatemall.com/article-roller-skating-being-considered-for-olympics.aspx</ref> but has never become an Olympic event.  Other roller skating sports include [[jam skating]] and [[roller derby]]. Roller skating popularity exploded during the [[disco]] era but tapered off in the 80s and 90s.\n\nThe Roller Skating Rink Operators Association was developed in the U.S. in 1937.

The first roller skate was effectively an ice skate with wheels replacing the blade. Later the \"quad\" style of roller skate became more popular consisting of four wheels arranged in the same configuration as a typical [[automobile|car]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:The Childrens Museum of Indianapolis -Roller Skates.jpg|thumbnail|right|A pair of roller skates within the permanent collection of [[The Children's Museum of Indianapolis]]. Skates like these fit over shoes and were adjustable.]]\n\nWhile the first reported use of roller skates was on a London stage in 1743, the first [[patent]]ed roller skate was introduced in 1760 by Belgian inventor [[John Joseph Merlin]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Foot and ankle sports orthopaedics|others=Valderrabano, Victor,, Easley, Mark E.|isbn=3319157345|location=Cham, Switzerland|oclc=972330993}}</ref> His roller skate wasn't much more than an [[ice skate]] with wheels where the blade goes, a style we would call inline today. They were hard to steer and hard to stop because they didn't have brakes and, as such, were not very popular. The initial \"test piloting\" of the first prototype of the skate was in the city of [[Huy]], which had a party with Merlin playing the [[violin]].\n\nIn the 1840s, Meyerbeer's opera ''[[Le proph\u00e8te]]'' featured a scene in which performers used roller-skates to simulate ice-skating on a frozen lake set on stage. The result was to popularize roller skating throughout the Continent. As ice skaters subsequently developed the art of figure skating, roller skaters wanted the ability to turn in their skates in a similar fashion.<ref>Wilson, David Gordon (2004). ''Bicycling Science'', 3rd Edition. MIT Press.</ref>\n\nIn 1863, [[James Leonard Plimpton|James Plimpton]] from Massachusetts invented the \"rocking\" skate and used a four-wheel configuration for stability, and independent axles that turned by pressing to one side of the skate or the other when the skater wants to create an edge. This was a vast improvement on the Merlin design, one that was easier to use and drove the huge popularity of [[roller skating]], dubbed  \"rinkomania\" in the 1860s and 1870s,<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-31831110 \"The Victorian craze that sparked a mini-sexual revolution\"], [[BBC News]], 6 April 2015</ref> which spread to Europe and around the world, and continued through the 1930s. The Plimpton skate is still used today.\n\nEventually, roller skating evolved from just a pastime to a competitive [[sport]]; [[Inline speed skating|speed skating]], racing on skates, and [[inline figure skating]], very similar to what can be seen in the Olympics on ice. In the mid 1990s [[roller hockey]], played with a ball rather than a puck, became so popular that it even made an appearance in the [[Olympic Games|Olympics]] in 1992. The National Sporting Goods Association statistics showed, from a 1999 study, that 2.5 million people played roller hockey. Roller skating was considered for the 2012 Summer Olympics<ref>http://www.skatemall.com/article-roller-skating-being-considered-for-olympics.aspx</ref> but has never become an Olympic event.  Other roller skating sports include [[jam skating]] and [[roller derby]]. Roller skating popularity exploded during the [[disco]] era but tapered off in the 80s and 90s.\n\nThe Roller Skating Rink Operators Association was developed in the U.S. in 1937. It is currently named the Roller Skating Association. The association promotes roller skating and offers classes to the public, aiming to educate the population about roller skating. The current president is Bobby Pender. The Roller Skating Association headquarters is located in [[Indianapolis]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nImage:1908-PatinsRoulettes.jpg|An advertisement for an early 20th-century model which fit over regular shoes\nImage:1917 Maryland Suffragettes picket White House.png|Young woman roller skating beside a group of women's [[suffragist]]s at the White House, 1917\nImage:BayStLouisRollerskates1921crop.jpg|Girl on roller skates, 1921\nFile:Old roller skates.jpg|Roller skates of a design common in the 1960s\nImage:Skates.jpg|Skates at [[Paul Bunyan Land]], [[Brainerd, Minnesota]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Health benefits==\nThe Roller Skating Association's web page offers some health benefits of roller skating.
