His feature documentaries include ''[[The Fabulous Allan Carr]], [[Tab Hunter Confidential]], [[I Am Divine]], [[Vito (film)|Vito]], [[Wrangler: Anatomy of an Icon]]'' and ''[[Spine Tingler! The William Castle Story]].''\n\n== Early career ==\nA [[New York City|New York]] native, Schwarz is a graduate of the [[SUNY Purchase]] Film Department. His senior thesis documentary was ''[[Al Lewis (actor)|Al Lewis]] in the Flesh'', a short film profiling Al Lewis, famous for playing Grandpa on the television series ''[[The Munsters]]''. The film observes Lewis as he interacts with the public at his Bleecker Street restaurant, Grampa's Bella Gente, and judges a low-rent Halloween costume contest at a corporate event. The documentary, which observed the American pastime of celebrity adulation, led to Schwarz's on-going interest in producing films about popular culture and Americana.\n\nHis first job in the film industry was as an apprentice editor on ''[[The Celluloid Closet]]'', [[Rob Epstein]] and [[Jeffrey Friedman (filmmaker)|Jeffrey Friedman]]'s film adaptation of [[Vito Russo]]'s seminal book. Schwarz's work on this project would later bridge into the development of his own documentary about Russo, titled simply ''[[Vito]]''.\n\nSchwarz spent the late 1990s working in the low budget feature world, editing movies and trailers for directors such as [[Gary Graver]], [[Fred Olen Ray]] and [[David DeCoteau]]. In 1998, Schwarz was hired to edit a documentary about the making of [[Gus Van Sant]]'s controversial remake of [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. ''Psycho Path'' was included on the [[Universal Pictures]] Home Entertainment DVD release of ''Psycho'', and was Schwarz's first foray into the burgeoning world of DVD bonus features, also known as value added material (VAM).\n\nAs the DVD format was introduced to the public, all the major studios began offering making-of featurettes and audio commentaries on their discs as an incentive to consumers to replace movies they already owned on VHS or laserdisc. Schwarz capitalized on this moment to segue into producing original bonus content, and soon became one of the leading producers in this field.\n\n== Automat Pictures ==\n\nAs assignments from the studios began to proliferate, Schwarz founded the [[Koreatown, Los Angeles]] based [[Automat Pictures]] in 2000 to keep up with the demand. Schwarz and a team of skilled producers created content for over 100 major DVD and Blu-ray studio releases, and soon expanded into the production of studio EPKs (electronic press kits) and original television programming.\n\nSome notable DVD releases produced by Schwarz include ''[[Raging Bull]]'', ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]], [[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]], [[This Is Spinal Tap]], [[Philadelphia (film)|Philadelphia]], [[A Nightmare on Elm Street]], [[Rent (film)|Rent]], [[Menace II Society]], [[When Harry Met Sally...]], [[Footloose (1984 film)|Footloose]], [[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre|The Texas Chainsaw Massacre]], [[Friday the 13th (1980 film)|Friday the 13th]], [[Fargo (film)|Fargo]], [[Basic Instinct]], [[Hairspray (1988 film)|Hairspray]], [[Friday (1995 film)|Friday]],'' and all six films in the ''[[Resident Evil]]'' franchise. Schwarz produced documentaries and audio commentaries for a range of notable filmmakers including [[Martin Scorsese]], [[David Lynch]], [[Jonathan Demme]], [[Ron Howard]], [[Wes Craven]], [[Rob Reiner]], [[Joe Dante]], [[Barry Sonnenfeld]], [[Paul Verhoeven]], [[Larry Cohen]], [[John Carpenter]], [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]], [[Roger Corman]], [[Nora Ephron]], [[Sidney Lumet]], and the [[Coen Brothers]].\n\nSchwarz's television productions include [[Starz]]'s ''Sex and the Cinema'', a look at sexuality on film; ''In the Gutter'', a history of the gross-out movie; ''Hitchcocked!'', a tribute to the artistry of [[Alfred Hitchcock]]; and ''Shooting the Police: Cops on Film''. For [[IFC Films|IFC]] he produced ''Reservoir Dogs Revisited'', a celebration of [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s classic, and ''Still Swingin''', a tribute to the indie classic ''[[Swingers (1996 film)|Swingers]]''. Schwarz also produced several episodes of [[HBO First Look]].\n\nIn 2007, Schwarz began to segue into producing independent documentary features, the first being ''Spine Tingler! The William Castle Story'' about cult filmmaker [[William Castle]]. This set into motion a series of award-winning independent documentaries, and as the proliferation of bonus content began to wane with the advent of streaming, [[Automat Pictures]] shifted its focus to feature film production.\n\n== ''Spine Tingler! The William Castle Story'' ==\n\n''[[Spine Tingler! The William Castle Story]]'' is a biographical documentary about legendary Hollywood showman [[William Castle]], who specialized in producing low-budget shockers. Featuring interviews with Castle's daughter Terry, [[John Waters]], [[Joe Dante]], [[John Landis]], [[Leonard Maltin]], [[Roger Corman]], [[John Badham]], [[Diane Baker]], and [[Marcel Marceau]], among others, the film premiered at the 2007 [[American Film Institute]]'s [[AFI Fest]] and was awarded the Audience Award for Best Documentary. It received many other festival honors and was released as part of the William Castle box set in 2009 by [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment]]. In 2011 the film was released as a stand-alone Special Edition DVD and is currently streaming on [[Vimeo]]. It has aired on [[Documentary Channel (TV network)|The Documentary Channel]] and [[Turner Classic Movies|TCM]].\n\n== ''Wrangler: Anatomy of an Icon'' ==\n\nIn 2008, Schwarz directed the feature documentary ''[[Wrangler: Anatomy of an Icon]]'', which focused on the life and career of porn star [[Jack Wrangler]], who became a superstar in both the gay and straight markets before marrying singer [[Margaret Whiting]] and retiring from the business. The film features Wrangler as well as a host of notable golden age porn figures such as Samantha Fox, [[Gloria Leonard]], [[Jamie Gillis]], [[Al Goldstein]], [[Joe Gage]], [[Sharon Mitchell]] and [[Candida Royalle]].

Critically well-received, ''[[Vito (film)|Vito]]'' was hailed by ''[[Time Magazine]]'' as a document that shows how civil rights and entertainment are \"deeply connected.\" Based on rejuvenated interest in Russo's life and work, Schwarz edited two volumes of Russo's writing entitled ''Out Spoken: A Vito Russo Reader''.\n\n== ''I Am Divine'' ==\n\nIn 2013, Schwarz turned his lens to famed [[Baltimore]] drag performer [[Divine (performer)|Divine]] with the celebratory documentary, ''[[I Am Divine]]''. Featuring extensive interviews with contemporaries and admirers including Divine's mother Frances Milstead, [[John Waters]], [[Mink Stole]], [[Tab Hunter]], [[Bruce Vilanch]], [[Susan Lowe]], [[Peaches Christ]], and [[Ricki Lake]], to name a few. The film had its world premiere at the 2013 [[South by Southwest]] Film Festival, and garnered much critical praise and audience good will. It was released on DVD by [[Wolfe Video]], who surprised critics with a chocolate turd along with their review copies.\n\n== ''Tab Hunter Confidential'' ==\n\nFollowing [[Tab Hunter]]'s participation in ''[[I Am Divine]]'', Schwarz was approached by Hunter's partner, Allan Glaser, about adapting Hunter's best-selling autobiography, ''Tab Hunter Confidential: The Making of a Movie Star'' (2005, co-written with Eddie Muller), into a documentary feature. The film features extensive interviews with [[Tab Hunter]], as well as friends and associates such as [[John Waters]], [[Debbie Reynolds]], [[Clint Eastwood]], and [[George Takei]]. It had its World Premiere at the 2015 [[South by Southwest]] Film Festival, and went on to screen at festivals around the world to great acclaim. Tab, Allan, and Jeffrey traveled the globe meeting old fans and new, spreading Tab's message of self-acceptance and gratitude.\n\n== ''The Fabulous Allan Carr'' ==\n\nSchwarz' latest film is a documentary about flamboyant Hollywood producer [[Allan Carr]], famous for producing ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'', ''[[Can't Stop the Music]]'', ''[[La Cage aux Folles (musical)|La Cage aux Folles]]'', and the notorious [[61st Academy Awards|1989 Academy Awards]] broadcast.

The sinking claimed 1,198 lives, 128 of them American civilians, and the attack of this unarmed civilian ship deeply shocked the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]]. According to the ship's manifest, ''Lusitania'' was carrying military cargo, though none of this information was relayed to the citizens of Britain and the United States who thought that the ship contained no ammunition or military weaponry whatsoever and it was an act of brutal murder. Munitions that it carried were thousands of crates full of ammunition for rifles, 3-inch artillery shells, and also various other standard ammunition used by infantry. The sinking of the ''Lusitania'' was widely used as propaganda against the German Empire and caused greater support for the war effort. A widespread reaction in the U.S was not seen until the attack on the ferry {{SS|Sussex}} which carried many citizens of the United States of America.\n\nThe initial U.S. response was to threaten to sever [[diplomatic ties]], which persuaded the Germans to issue the [[Sussex pledge]] that reimposed restrictions on U-boat activity. The U.S. reiterated its objections to German submarine warfare whenever U.S. civilians died as a result of German attacks, which prompted the Germans to fully reapply prize rules. This, however, removed the effectiveness of the U-boat fleet, and the Germans consequently sought a decisive surface action, a strategy that culminated in the [[Battle of Jutland]].\n\nAlthough the Germans claimed victory at Jutland, the [[British Grand Fleet]] remained in control at sea. It was necessary to return to effective anticommerce warfare by U-boats. Vice-Admiral [[Reinhard Scheer]], Commander in Chief of the [[High Seas Fleet]], pressed for all-out U-boat war, convinced that a high rate of shipping losses would force Britain to seek an early peace before the United States could react effectively.\n\n[[File:Willy St\u00f6wer - Sinking of the Linda Blanche out of Liverpool.jpg|thumb|''Sinking of the Linda Blanche out of Liverpool'' by {{SMU|U-21|Germany|6}} ([[Willy St\u00f6wer]])]]\nThe renewed German campaign was effective, sinking 1.4&nbsp;million tons of shipping between October 1916 and January 1917. Despite this, the political situation demanded even greater pressure, and on 31 January 1917, Germany announced that its U-boats would engage in [[unrestricted submarine warfare]] beginning 1 February. On 17 March, German submarines sank three American merchant vessels, and the U.S. declared war on Germany in April 1917.\n\nUnrestricted submarine warfare in early 1917 was initially very successful, sinking a major part of Britain-bound shipping. With the introduction of escorted convoys, shipping losses declined and in the end the German strategy failed to destroy sufficient Allied shipping. An armistice became effective on 11 November 1918.

Before the start of World War II, Germany started building U-boats and training crews, labeling these activities as \"research\" or concealing them using other covers.

Cross-Atlantic trade in war supplies and food was extensive and critical for Britain's survival. The continuous action surrounding British shipping became known as the [[Battle of the Atlantic]], as the British developed technical defences such as [[ASDIC]] and [[radar]], and the German U-boats responded by hunting in what were called \"[[Wolfpack (naval tactic)|wolfpacks]]\" where multiple submarines would stay close together, making it easier for them to sink a specific target. Britain's vulnerable shipping situation existed until 1942, when the tides changed as the U.S. merchant marine and Navy entered the war, drastically increasing the amount of tonnage of supplies sent across the Atlantic. The combination of increased tonnage and increased naval protection of shipping convoys made it much more difficult for U-boats to make a significant dent in British shipping. Once the United States entered the war, U-boats ranged from the Atlantic coast of the United States and Canada to the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and from the [[Arctic]] to the west and southern African coasts and even as far east as [[Penang]]. The [[United States armed forces|U.S. military]] engaged in various tactics against German incursions in the [[Americas]]; these included military surveillance of foreign nations in Latin America, particularly in the Caribbean, to deter any local governments from supplying German U-boats.\n\nBecause speed and range were severely limited underwater while running on battery power, U-boats were required to spend most of their time surfaced running on diesel engines, diving only when attacked or for rare daytime torpedo strikes. The more ship-like hull design reflects the fact that these were primarily surface vessels that could submerge when necessary. This contrasts with the cylindrical profile of modern [[nuclear submarine]]s, which are more hydrodynamic underwater (where they spend the majority of their time), but less stable on the surface. While U-boats were faster on the surface than submerged, the opposite is generally true of modern submarines. The most common [[submarine warfare|U-boat attack]] during the early years of the war was conducted on the surface and at night. This period, before the Allied forces developed truly effective antisubmarine warfare <!-- (ASW) --> tactics, which included convoys, was referred to by German submariners as \"''die gl\u00fcckliche Zeit''\" or the [[First Happy Time]].<ref name=\"milHisOnline\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.militaryhistoryonline.com/wwii/atlantic/uboatwar.aspx|title=Military History Online|website=www.militaryhistoryonline.com|access-date=2019-02-04}}</ref>\n[[File:u534.jpg|thumb|[[German submarine U-534|''U-534'']], Birkenhead Docks, Merseyside, England]]\n\n===Torpedoes===\nThe U-boats' main weapon was the [[torpedo]], though [[sea mine|mine]]s and [[deck gun]]s (while surfaced) were also used. By the end of the war, almost 3,000 Allied ships (175 warships; 2,825 merchant ships) were sunk by U-boat torpedoes.<ref name=\"Tread\">{{cite book|last=Crocker III|first=H.

They were fitted with one of two types of pistol triggers: impact, which detonated the warhead upon contact with a solid object, and [[Magnetic pistol|magnetic]], which detonated upon sensing a change in the magnetic field within a few meters.\n\nOne of the most effective uses of magnetic pistols would be to set the torpedo's depth to just beneath the keel of the target. The explosion under the target's keel would create a [[detonation]] [[shock wave]], which could cause a ship's hull to rupture under the concussive water pressure. In this way, even large or heavily armored ships could be sunk or disabled with a single, well-placed hit.\n\nInitially the depth-keeping equipment and magnetic and contact exploders were notoriously unreliable.  During the first eight months of the war torpedoes often ran at an improper depth, detonated prematurely, or failed to explode altogether\u2014sometimes bouncing harmlessly off the hull of the target ship. This was most evident in [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung]], the invasion of Norway, where various skilled U-boat commanders failed to inflict damage on British transports and warships because of faulty torpedoes. The faults were largely due to a lack of testing. The magnetic detonator was sensitive to mechanical oscillations during the torpedo run, and to fluctuations in the Earth's magnetic field at high latitudes. These early magnetic detonators were eventually phased out, and the depth-keeping problem was solved by early 1942 with improved technology.<ref>{{cite book|author=Karl D\u00f6nitz|title=Memoirs: Ten Years and Twenty Days|publisher=Naval Institute Press|page=482|isbn=0-87021-780-1}}</ref>{{explain|date=January 2019}}\n\nLater in the war, Germany developed an acoustic homing torpedo, the [[G7e torpedo|G7/T5]]. It was primarily designed to combat convoy escorts. The acoustic torpedo was designed to run straight to an arming distance of 400 m and then turn toward the loudest noise detected. This sometimes ended up being the U-boat itself; at least two submarines may have been sunk by their own homing torpedoes. Additionally, these torpedoes were found to be only effective against ships moving at greater than {{convert|15|kn|km/h}}. The Allies countered acoustic torpedoes with noisemaker decoys such as ''[[Foxer]]'', ''FXR'', ''CAT'' and [[Fanfare (decoy)|''Fanfare'']]. The Germans, in turn, countered this by introducing newer and upgraded versions of the acoustic torpedoes, like the late-war [[G7es torpedo|G7es]], and the [[T11 torpedo|T11]]. However, the T11 did not see active service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uboat.net/technical/torpedoes.htm|title=The Torpedoes|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nU-boats also adopted several types of \"pattern-running\" torpedoes that ran straight out to a preset distance, then traveled in either a circular or ladder-like pattern. When fired at a convoy, this increased the probability of a hit if the weapon missed its primary target.\n\n===U-boat developments===\nDuring World War II, the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' produced many different types of U-boats as technology evolved. Most notable is the Type VII, known as the \"workhorse\" of the fleet, which was by far the most-produced type, and the Type IX boats, an enlarged VII designed for long-range patrols, some traveling as far as Japan and the east coast of the United States.\n\n[[File:U-boot by Ferrer-Dalmau.jpg|thumb|upright|Oil painting of a [[Kriegsmarine]] U-boat, by [[Augusto Ferrer-Dalmau]]]]\n\nWith the increasing sophistication of Allied detection and subsequent losses, German designers began to fully realise the potential for a truly submerged boat. The [[German Type XXI submarine|Type XXI]] \"''Elektroboot''\" was designed to favor submerged performance, both for combat effectiveness and survival. It was the first true submersible. The Type XXI featured an evolutionary design that combined several different strands of the U-boat development program, most notably from the Walter U-boats, the [[German Type XVIIB submarine|Type XVII]], which featured an unsuccessful yet revolutionary [[hydrogen peroxide]] [[air-independent propulsion|air-independent]] [[hydrogen peroxide#Propellant|propellant]] system. These boats featured a streamlined hull design, which formed the basis of the later {{USS|Nautilus|SSN-571|6}} nuclear submarine, and was adapted for use with more conventional propulsion systems. The larger hull design allowed for a greatly increased battery capacity, which enabled the XXI to cruise submerged for longer periods and reach unprecedented submerged speeds for the time. Waste disposal was a problem when the U-boats spent extended periods without surfacing, as it is today.\n\nThroughout the war, an [[arms race]] evolved between the Allies and the ''Kriegsmarine'', especially in detection and counterdetection. [[Sonar]] (ASDIC in Britain) allowed Allied warships to detect submerged U-boats (and vice versa) beyond visual range, but was not effective against a surfaced vessel; thus, early in the war, a U-boat at night or in bad weather was actually safer on the surface. Advancements in [[radar]] became particularly deadly for the U-boat crews, especially once aircraft-mounted units were developed. As a countermeasure, U-boats were fitted with radar warning receivers, to give them ample time to dive before the enemy closed in, as well as more anti aircraft guns. However, by early to mid-1943, the Allies switched to [[Radar in World War II#Centimetric|centimetric radar]] (unknown to Germany), which rendered the radar detectors ineffective. U-boat radar systems were also developed, but many captains chose not to use them for fear of broadcasting their position to enemy patrols and lack of sufficient electronic countermeasures.\n\nEarly on, the Germans experimented with the idea of the [[Submarine snorkel|''Schnorchel'']] (snorkel) from captured Dutch submarines, but saw no need for them until rather late in the war. The ''Schnorchel'' was a retractable pipe that supplied air to the diesel engines while submerged at [[periscope depth]], allowing the boats to cruise and recharge their batteries while maintaining a degree of stealth. It was far from a perfect solution, however. Problems occurred with the device's valve sticking shut or closing as it dunked in rough weather; since the system used the entire pressure hull as a buffer, the diesels would instantaneously suck huge volumes of air from the boat's compartments, and the crew often suffered painful ear injuries. Speed was limited to {{convert|8|kn|km/h}}, lest the device snap from stress. The ''Schnorchel'' also had the effect of making the boat essentially noisy and deaf in sonar terms. Finally, Allied radar eventually became sufficiently advanced that the ''Schnorchel'' mast could be detected beyond visual range.\n\nSeveral other pioneering innovations included acoustic- and electro-absorbent coatings to make them less of an ASDIC or RADAR target. The Germans also developed active countermeasures such as facilities to release artificial chemical bubble-making decoys, known as ''[[Bold (decoy)|Bold]]'', after the mythical [[kobold]].\n\n===Classes===\n* [[German Type I submarine|Type I]]: first prototypes\n* [[German Type II submarine|Type II]]: small submarines used for training purposes\n* [[Uncompleted U-boat projects|Type V]]: uncompleted experimental midget submarines\n* [[German Type VII submarine|Type VII]]: the \"workhorse\" of the U-boats with 709 completed in World War II<ref>{{cite book |last1=Stern |first1=Robert Cecil |title=Type VII U-boats |date=1991 |publisher=Naval Institute Press |location=Annapolis, Maryland |isbn=1-55750-828-3 |page=155 |edition=First U.S. & Canada |url=https://uboat.net/books/item/378 |accessdate=1 January 2019}}</ref>\n* [[German Type IX submarine|Type IX]]: these long-range U-boats operated as far as the Indian Ocean with the Japanese ([[Monsun Gruppe]]), and the [[South Atlantic]]\n* [[German Type X submarine|Type X]]: long-range minelayers and cargo transports\n* [[Uncompleted U-boat projects|Type XI]]: uncompleted experimental artillery boats\n* [[German Type XIV submarine|Type XIV]]: used to resupply other U-boats; nicknamed the ''Milchkuh'' (\"Milk Cow\")\n* [[German Type XVII submarine|Type XVII]]: small coastal submarines powered by experimental hydrogen peroxide propulsion systems\n* [[German Type XXI submarine|Type XXI]]: known as the ''Elektroboot''; first subs to operate primarily submerged\n* [[German Type XXIII submarine|Type XXIII]]: smaller version of the XXI used for coastal operations \n* [[Midget submarine]]s, including [[Biber (submarine)|''Biber'']], [[Hai (midget submarine)|''Hai'']], ''[[Molch]]'', and ''[[Seehund]]''\n* [[Uncompleted U-boat projects]]\n\n===Countermeasures===\n{{Main|Anti-submarine warfare}}\n[[File:Uboat sinking survivors.png|right|thumb|Survivors from {{GS|U-175}} after being sunk by {{USCGC|Spencer|WPG-36|6}}, 17 April 1943]]\nAdvances in convoy tactics, high-frequency direction finding (referred to as \"[[Huff-Duff]]\"), radar, active [[sonar]] (called ASDIC in Britain), [[depth charge]]s, ASW spigot mortars (also known as [[Hedgehog (weapon)|\"hedgehog\"]]), the intermittent cracking of the German Naval [[Enigma code]], the introduction of the [[Leigh light]], the range of escort aircraft (especially with the use of [[escort carrier]]s), the use of [[Q-ship|mystery ships]], and the full entry of the U.S. into the war with its enormous shipbuilding capacity, all turned the tide against the U-boats. In the end, the U-boat fleet suffered extremely heavy casualties, losing 793 U-boats and about 28,000 submariners (a 75% casualty rate, the highest of all German forces during the war).\n\nAt the same time, the Allies targeted the U-boat shipyards and their bases with [[strategic bombing]].\n\n===Enigma machine===\n{{Main|Enigma machine}}\nThe British had a major advantage in their ability to read some German naval Enigma codes. An understanding of the German coding methods had been brought to Britain via France from [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma#Polish breakthrough|Polish code-breakers]]. Thereafter, code books and equipment were captured by raids on German weather ships and from captured U-boats. A team including [[Alan Turing]] used special purpose \"[[Bombe]]s\" and early [[computer]]s to break new German codes as they were introduced. The speedy decoding of messages was vital in directing convoys away from wolf packs and allowing interception and destruction of U-boats. This was demonstrated when the Naval Enigma machines were altered in February 1942 and wolf-pack effectiveness greatly increased until the new code was broken.\n\nThe {{GS|U-110|1940|6}}, a [[Type IX U-boat|Type IXB]], was captured in 1941 by the [[Royal Navy]], and its Enigma machine and documents were removed. {{GS|U-559|3=2}} was also captured by the British in October 1942; three sailors boarded her as she was sinking, and desperately threw all the code books out of the submarine so as to salvage them. Two of them, Able Seaman [[Colin Grazier]] and Lieutenant [[Francis Anthony Blair Fasson]], continued to throw code books out of the ship as it went under water, and went down with it. Further code books were captured by raids on weather ships. {{GS|U-744|3=2}} was boarded by crew from the Canadian ship {{HMCS|Chilliwack|K131|6}} on 6 March 1944, and codes were taken from her, but by this time in the war, most of the information was known.<ref>Helgason, Gudmundur \"Captured U Boats\" UBoat.Net http://uboat.net/fates/captured.htm</ref> The {{GS|U-505|3=2}}, a [[Type IX U-boat|Type IXC]], was captured by the [[United States Navy]] in June 1944.

Of the 154 U-boats surrendered, 121 were scuttled in deep water off [[Londonderry Port|Lisahally]], Northern Ireland, or [[Loch Ryan]], Scotland, in late 1945 and early 1946.\n\n==Memorial==\n[[M\u00f6ltenort U-Boat Memorial]]\n\n==Post\u2013World War II and Cold War (after 1945)==\n[[File:U15 Kieler Woche 2007 1.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''U-15'', a [[Type 206 submarine]], of the [[German Navy]] at the [[Kiel Week]] 2007]]\nFrom 1955, the West German ''[[Bundesmarine]]'' was allowed to have a small navy. Initially two sunken Type XXIIIs and a Type XXI were raised and repaired. In the 1960s, the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) re-entered the submarine business. Because West Germany was initially restricted to a 450 tonne displacement limit, the ''Bundesmarine'' focused on small [[coastal submarine]]s to protect against the [[Soviet Union]] ([[Russia]]n) threat in the [[Baltic Sea]]. The Germans sought to use advanced technologies to offset the small displacement, such as [[ferromagnetism|amagnetic]] [[steel]] to protect against [[naval mine]]s and [[magnetic anomaly detector]]s.\n\nThe initial [[Type 201 submarine|Type 201]] was a failure because of hull cracking; the subsequent [[Type 205 submarine|Type 205]], first commissioned in 1967, was a success, and 12 were built for the German navy. To continue the U-boat tradition, the new boats received the classic '''U''' designation starting with the ''U-1''.\n\nWith the [[Denmark|Danish]] government's purchase of two Type 205 boats, the West German government realized the potential for the submarine as an export, developing a customized version [[Kobben-class submarine|Type 207]]. Small and agile submarines were built during the Cold War to operate in the shallow Baltic Sea and attack Warsaw Pact resulting in the [[Type 206 submarine|Type 206]]. Three of the improved [[Type 206 submarine|Type 206]] boats were later sold to the [[Israeli Navy]], becoming the [[Gal class submarine|Type 540]]. The German [[Type 209 submarine|Type 209]] diesel-electric submarine was the most popular export-sales submarine in the world from the late 1960s into the first years of the 21st century. With a larger 1,000\u20131,500 tonne displacement, the class was very customizable and has seen service with 14 navies with 51 examples being built as of 2006. Germany would continue to reap successes with derivations or on the basis of the successful type 209, as are the [[Dolphin-class submarine|Type 800]] sold to [[Israel]] and the [[TR-1700-class submarine|TR-1700]] sold to [[Argentine]].\n\nGermany would continue to succeed as an exporter of submarines as the [[Ula-class submarine|Klasse 210]] sold to [[Norway]], considered the most silent and maneuverable submarines in the world. This would demonstrate its capacity and put its export seal on the world.\n\n[[File:U Boot 212 HDW 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Type 212 submarine]] with air-independent propulsion of the [[German Navy]] in dock at [[Howaldtswerke|HDW]]/[[Kiel]]]]\nGermany has brought the U-boat name into the 21st century with the new [[Type 212 submarine|Type 212]].

While the German term refers to any [[submarine]], the English one (in common with several other languages) refers specifically to [[Submarine#Military|military submarine]]s operated by Germany, particularly in the [[World War I|First]] and [[World War II|Second]] World Wars. Although at times they were efficient fleet weapons against enemy naval warships, they were most effectively used in an economic warfare role ([[commerce raiding]]) and enforcing a naval [[blockade]] against enemy shipping. The primary targets of the U-boat campaigns in both wars were the merchant convoys bringing supplies from Canada and other parts of the [[British Empire]], and from the United States to the United Kingdom and (during the Second World War) to the Soviet Union and the Allied territories in the Mediterranean. German submarines also destroyed Brazilian merchant ships during World War II, causing Brazil to declare war on both Germany and Italy on 22 August 1942.\n\n[[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] submarines were also known as U-boats.\n\n==Early U-boats (1850\u20131914)==\nThe first submarine built in Germany, the three-man ''[[Brandtaucher]]'', sank to the bottom of [[Kiel]] harbor on 1 February 1851 during a test dive.<ref>Showell, p. 23</ref><ref>\nCompare: {{cite book\n| last1 = Chaffin\n| first1 = Tom\n| title = The H.

The sinking claimed 1,198 lives, 128 of them American civilians, and the attack of this unarmed civilian ship deeply shocked the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]]. According to the ship's manifest, ''Lusitania'' was carrying military cargo, though none of this information was relayed to the citizens of Britain and the United States who thought that the ship contained no ammunition or military weaponry whatsoever and it was an act of brutal murder. Munitions that it carried were thousands of crates full of ammunition for rifles, 3-inch artillery shells, and also various other standard ammunition used by infantry. The sinking of the ''Lusitania'' was widely used as propaganda against the German Empire and caused greater support for the war effort. A widespread reaction in the U.S was not seen until the attack on the ferry {{SS|Sussex}} which carried many citizens of the United States of America.\n\nThe initial U.S. response was to threaten to sever [[diplomatic ties]], which persuaded the Germans to issue the [[Sussex pledge]] that reimposed restrictions on U-boat activity. The U.S. reiterated its objections to German submarine warfare whenever U.S. civilians died as a result of German attacks, which prompted the Germans to fully reapply prize rules. This, however, removed the effectiveness of the U-boat fleet, and the Germans consequently sought a decisive surface action, a strategy that culminated in the [[Battle of Jutland]].\n\nAlthough the Germans claimed victory at Jutland, the [[British Grand Fleet]] remained in control at sea. It was necessary to return to effective anticommerce warfare by U-boats. Vice-Admiral [[Reinhard Scheer]], Commander in Chief of the [[High Seas Fleet]], pressed for all-out U-boat war, convinced that a high rate of shipping losses would force Britain to seek an early peace before the United States could react effectively.\n\n[[File:Willy St\u00f6wer - Sinking of the Linda Blanche out of Liverpool.jpg|thumb|''Sinking of the Linda Blanche out of Liverpool'' by {{SMU|U-21|Germany|6}} ([[Willy St\u00f6wer]])]]\nThe renewed German campaign was effective, sinking 1.4&nbsp;million tons of shipping between October 1916 and January 1917. Despite this, the political situation demanded even greater pressure, and on 31 January 1917, Germany announced that its U-boats would engage in [[unrestricted submarine warfare]] beginning 1 February. On 17 March, German submarines sank three American merchant vessels, and the U.S. declared war on Germany in April 1917.\n\nUnrestricted submarine warfare in early 1917 was initially very successful, sinking a major part of Britain-bound shipping. With the introduction of escorted convoys, shipping losses declined and in the end the German strategy failed to destroy sufficient Allied shipping. An armistice became effective on 11 November 1918.

However, a [[NV Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheepsbouw|submarine design office]] was set up in the [[Netherlands]] and a torpedo research program was started in Sweden. Before the start of World War II, Germany started building U-boats and training crews, labeling these activities as \"research\" or concealing them using other covers. When this became known, the [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement]] limited Germany to parity with Britain in submarines. When World War II started, Germany already had 65 U-boats, with 21 of those at sea, ready for war.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/lostsub/mapsans.html|title=NOVA Online {{!}} Hitler's Lost Sub {{!}} Map of Lost U-Boats (frameless)|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=2019-04-25}}</ref>\n\n==World War II (1939\u20131945)==\n{{Main|Battle of the Atlantic}}\nDuring [[World War II]], U-boat warfare was the major component of the [[Battle of the Atlantic]], which began in 1939 and ended with Germany's surrender in 1945.

Cross-Atlantic trade in war supplies and food was extensive and critical for Britain's survival. The continuous action surrounding British shipping became known as the [[Battle of the Atlantic]], as the British developed technical defences such as [[ASDIC]] and [[radar]], and the German U-boats responded by hunting in what were called \"[[Wolfpack (naval tactic)|wolfpacks]]\" where multiple submarines would stay close together, making it easier for them to sink a specific target. Britain's vulnerable shipping situation existed until 1942, when the tides changed as the U.S. merchant marine and Navy entered the war, drastically increasing the amount of tonnage of supplies sent across the Atlantic. The combination of increased tonnage and increased naval protection of shipping convoys made it much more difficult for U-boats to make a significant dent in British shipping. Once the United States entered the war, U-boats ranged from the Atlantic coast of the United States and Canada to the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and from the [[Arctic]] to the west and southern African coasts and even as far east as [[Penang]]. The [[United States armed forces|U.S. military]] engaged in various tactics against German incursions in the [[Americas]]; these included military surveillance of foreign nations in Latin America, particularly in the Caribbean, to deter any local governments from supplying German U-boats.\n\nBecause speed and range were severely limited underwater while running on battery power, U-boats were required to spend most of their time surfaced running on diesel engines, diving only when attacked or for rare daytime torpedo strikes. The more ship-like hull design reflects the fact that these were primarily surface vessels that could submerge when necessary. This contrasts with the cylindrical profile of modern [[nuclear submarine]]s, which are more hydrodynamic underwater (where they spend the majority of their time), but less stable on the surface. While U-boats were faster on the surface than submerged, the opposite is generally true of modern submarines. The most common [[submarine warfare|U-boat attack]] during the early years of the war was conducted on the surface and at night. This period, before the Allied forces developed truly effective antisubmarine warfare <!-- (ASW) --> tactics, which included convoys, was referred to by German submariners as \"''die gl\u00fcckliche Zeit''\" or the [[First Happy Time]].<ref name=\"milHisOnline\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.militaryhistoryonline.com/wwii/atlantic/uboatwar.aspx|title=Military History Online|website=www.militaryhistoryonline.com|access-date=2019-02-04}}</ref>\n[[File:u534.jpg|thumb|[[German submarine U-534|''U-534'']], Birkenhead Docks, Merseyside, England]]\n\n===Torpedoes===\nThe U-boats' main weapon was the [[torpedo]], though [[sea mine|mine]]s and [[deck gun]]s (while surfaced) were also used. By the end of the war, almost 3,000 Allied ships (175 warships; 2,825 merchant ships) were sunk by U-boat torpedoes.<ref name=\"Tread\">{{cite book|last=Crocker III|first=H.

They were fitted with one of two types of pistol triggers: impact, which detonated the warhead upon contact with a solid object, and [[Magnetic pistol|magnetic]], which detonated upon sensing a change in the magnetic field within a few meters.\n\nOne of the most effective uses of magnetic pistols would be to set the torpedo's depth to just beneath the keel of the target. The explosion under the target's keel would create a [[detonation]] [[shock wave]], which could cause a ship's hull to rupture under the concussive water pressure. In this way, even large or heavily armored ships could be sunk or disabled with a single, well-placed hit.\n\nInitially the depth-keeping equipment and magnetic and contact exploders were notoriously unreliable.  During the first eight months of the war torpedoes often ran at an improper depth, detonated prematurely, or failed to explode altogether\u2014sometimes bouncing harmlessly off the hull of the target ship. This was most evident in [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung]], the invasion of Norway, where various skilled U-boat commanders failed to inflict damage on British transports and warships because of faulty torpedoes. The faults were largely due to a lack of testing. The magnetic detonator was sensitive to mechanical oscillations during the torpedo run, and to fluctuations in the Earth's magnetic field at high latitudes. These early magnetic detonators were eventually phased out, and the depth-keeping problem was solved by early 1942 with improved technology.<ref>{{cite book|author=Karl D\u00f6nitz|title=Memoirs: Ten Years and Twenty Days|publisher=Naval Institute Press|page=482|isbn=0-87021-780-1}}</ref>{{explain|date=January 2019}}\n\nLater in the war, Germany developed an acoustic homing torpedo, the [[G7e torpedo|G7/T5]]. It was primarily designed to combat convoy escorts. The acoustic torpedo was designed to run straight to an arming distance of 400 m and then turn toward the loudest noise detected. This sometimes ended up being the U-boat itself; at least two submarines may have been sunk by their own homing torpedoes. Additionally, these torpedoes were found to be only effective against ships moving at greater than {{convert|15|kn|km/h}}. The Allies countered acoustic torpedoes with noisemaker decoys such as ''[[Foxer]]'', ''FXR'', ''CAT'' and [[Fanfare (decoy)|''Fanfare'']]. The Germans, in turn, countered this by introducing newer and upgraded versions of the acoustic torpedoes, like the late-war [[G7es torpedo|G7es]], and the [[T11 torpedo|T11]]. However, the T11 did not see active service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uboat.net/technical/torpedoes.htm|title=The Torpedoes|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nU-boats also adopted several types of \"pattern-running\" torpedoes that ran straight out to a preset distance, then traveled in either a circular or ladder-like pattern. When fired at a convoy, this increased the probability of a hit if the weapon missed its primary target.\n\n===U-boat developments===\nDuring World War II, the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' produced many different types of U-boats as technology evolved. Most notable is the Type VII, known as the \"workhorse\" of the fleet, which was by far the most-produced type, and the Type IX boats, an enlarged VII designed for long-range patrols, some traveling as far as Japan and the east coast of the United States.\n\n[[File:U-boot by Ferrer-Dalmau.jpg|thumb|upright|Oil painting of a [[Kriegsmarine]] U-boat, by [[Augusto Ferrer-Dalmau]]]]\n\nWith the increasing sophistication of Allied detection and subsequent losses, German designers began to fully realise the potential for a truly submerged boat. The [[German Type XXI submarine|Type XXI]] \"''Elektroboot''\" was designed to favor submerged performance, both for combat effectiveness and survival. It was the first true submersible. The Type XXI featured an evolutionary design that combined several different strands of the U-boat development program, most notably from the Walter U-boats, the [[German Type XVIIB submarine|Type XVII]], which featured an unsuccessful yet revolutionary [[hydrogen peroxide]] [[air-independent propulsion|air-independent]] [[hydrogen peroxide#Propellant|propellant]] system. These boats featured a streamlined hull design, which formed the basis of the later {{USS|Nautilus|SSN-571|6}} nuclear submarine, and was adapted for use with more conventional propulsion systems. The larger hull design allowed for a greatly increased battery capacity, which enabled the XXI to cruise submerged for longer periods and reach unprecedented submerged speeds for the time. Waste disposal was a problem when the U-boats spent extended periods without surfacing, as it is today.\n\nThroughout the war, an [[arms race]] evolved between the Allies and the ''Kriegsmarine'', especially in detection and counterdetection. [[Sonar]] (ASDIC in Britain) allowed Allied warships to detect submerged U-boats (and vice versa) beyond visual range, but was not effective against a surfaced vessel; thus, early in the war, a U-boat at night or in bad weather was actually safer on the surface. Advancements in [[radar]] became particularly deadly for the U-boat crews, especially once aircraft-mounted units were developed. As a countermeasure, U-boats were fitted with radar warning receivers, to give them ample time to dive before the enemy closed in, as well as more anti aircraft guns. However, by early to mid-1943, the Allies switched to [[Radar in World War II#Centimetric|centimetric radar]] (unknown to Germany), which rendered the radar detectors ineffective. U-boat radar systems were also developed, but many captains chose not to use them for fear of broadcasting their position to enemy patrols and lack of sufficient electronic countermeasures.\n\nEarly on, the Germans experimented with the idea of the [[Submarine snorkel|''Schnorchel'']] (snorkel) from captured Dutch submarines, but saw no need for them until rather late in the war. The ''Schnorchel'' was a retractable pipe that supplied air to the diesel engines while submerged at [[periscope depth]], allowing the boats to cruise and recharge their batteries while maintaining a degree of stealth. It was far from a perfect solution, however. Problems occurred with the device's valve sticking shut or closing as it dunked in rough weather; since the system used the entire pressure hull as a buffer, the diesels would instantaneously suck huge volumes of air from the boat's compartments, and the crew often suffered painful ear injuries. Speed was limited to {{convert|8|kn|km/h}}, lest the device snap from stress. The ''Schnorchel'' also had the effect of making the boat essentially noisy and deaf in sonar terms. Finally, Allied radar eventually became sufficiently advanced that the ''Schnorchel'' mast could be detected beyond visual range.\n\nSeveral other pioneering innovations included acoustic- and electro-absorbent coatings to make them less of an ASDIC or RADAR target. The Germans also developed active countermeasures such as facilities to release artificial chemical bubble-making decoys, known as ''[[Bold (decoy)|Bold]]'', after the mythical [[kobold]].\n\n===Classes===\n* [[German Type I submarine|Type I]]: first prototypes\n* [[German Type II submarine|Type II]]: small submarines used for training purposes\n* [[Uncompleted U-boat projects|Type V]]: uncompleted experimental midget submarines\n* [[German Type VII submarine|Type VII]]: the \"workhorse\" of the U-boats with 709 completed in World War II<ref>{{cite book |last1=Stern |first1=Robert Cecil |title=Type VII U-boats |date=1991 |publisher=Naval Institute Press |location=Annapolis, Maryland |isbn=1-55750-828-3 |page=155 |edition=First U.S. & Canada |url=https://uboat.net/books/item/378 |accessdate=1 January 2019}}</ref>\n* [[German Type IX submarine|Type IX]]: these long-range U-boats operated as far as the Indian Ocean with the Japanese ([[Monsun Gruppe]]), and the [[South Atlantic]]\n* [[German Type X submarine|Type X]]: long-range minelayers and cargo transports\n* [[Uncompleted U-boat projects|Type XI]]: uncompleted experimental artillery boats\n* [[German Type XIV submarine|Type XIV]]: used to resupply other U-boats; nicknamed the ''Milchkuh'' (\"Milk Cow\")\n* [[German Type XVII submarine|Type XVII]]: small coastal submarines powered by experimental hydrogen peroxide propulsion systems\n* [[German Type XXI submarine|Type XXI]]: known as the ''Elektroboot''; first subs to operate primarily submerged\n* [[German Type XXIII submarine|Type XXIII]]: smaller version of the XXI used for coastal operations \n* [[Midget submarine]]s, including [[Biber (submarine)|''Biber'']], [[Hai (midget submarine)|''Hai'']], ''[[Molch]]'', and ''[[Seehund]]''\n* [[Uncompleted U-boat projects]]\n\n===Countermeasures===\n{{Main|Anti-submarine warfare}}\n[[File:Uboat sinking survivors.png|right|thumb|Survivors from {{GS|U-175}} after being sunk by {{USCGC|Spencer|WPG-36|6}}, 17 April 1943]]\nAdvances in convoy tactics, high-frequency direction finding (referred to as \"[[Huff-Duff]]\"), radar, active [[sonar]] (called ASDIC in Britain), [[depth charge]]s, ASW spigot mortars (also known as [[Hedgehog (weapon)|\"hedgehog\"]]), the intermittent cracking of the German Naval [[Enigma code]], the introduction of the [[Leigh light]], the range of escort aircraft (especially with the use of [[escort carrier]]s), the use of [[Q-ship|mystery ships]], and the full entry of the U.S. into the war with its enormous shipbuilding capacity, all turned the tide against the U-boats. In the end, the U-boat fleet suffered extremely heavy casualties, losing 793 U-boats and about 28,000 submariners (a 75% casualty rate, the highest of all German forces during the war).\n\nAt the same time, the Allies targeted the U-boat shipyards and their bases with [[strategic bombing]].\n\n===Enigma machine===\n{{Main|Enigma machine}}\nThe British had a major advantage in their ability to read some German naval Enigma codes. An understanding of the German coding methods had been brought to Britain via France from [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma#Polish breakthrough|Polish code-breakers]]. Thereafter, code books and equipment were captured by raids on German weather ships and from captured U-boats. A team including [[Alan Turing]] used special purpose \"[[Bombe]]s\" and early [[computer]]s to break new German codes as they were introduced. The speedy decoding of messages was vital in directing convoys away from wolf packs and allowing interception and destruction of U-boats. This was demonstrated when the Naval Enigma machines were altered in February 1942 and wolf-pack effectiveness greatly increased until the new code was broken.\n\nThe {{GS|U-110|1940|6}}, a [[Type IX U-boat|Type IXB]], was captured in 1941 by the [[Royal Navy]], and its Enigma machine and documents were removed. {{GS|U-559|3=2}} was also captured by the British in October 1942; three sailors boarded her as she was sinking, and desperately threw all the code books out of the submarine so as to salvage them. Two of them, Able Seaman [[Colin Grazier]] and Lieutenant [[Francis Anthony Blair Fasson]], continued to throw code books out of the ship as it went under water, and went down with it. Further code books were captured by raids on weather ships. {{GS|U-744|3=2}} was boarded by crew from the Canadian ship {{HMCS|Chilliwack|K131|6}} on 6 March 1944, and codes were taken from her, but by this time in the war, most of the information was known.<ref>Helgason, Gudmundur \"Captured U Boats\" UBoat.Net http://uboat.net/fates/captured.htm</ref> The {{GS|U-505|3=2}}, a [[Type IX U-boat|Type IXC]], was captured by the [[United States Navy]] in June 1944. It is now a [[museum ship]] in Chicago at the [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Museum of Science and Industry]].\n\n===Battle of Bell Island===\n{{Main|Battle of the St. Lawrence}}\nTwo events in the battle took place in 1942 when German U-boats attacked four allied [[ore]] carriers at [[Bell Island (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Bell Island]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]. The [[Cargo ship|carriers]] {{SS|Saganaga}} and {{SS|Lord Strathcona}} were sunk by {{GS|U-513|3=2}} on 5 September 1942, while the {{SS|Rosecastle}} and ''PLM 27'' were sunk by {{GS|U-518|3=2}} on 2 November with the loss of 69 lives. When the submarine launched a torpedo at the loading pier, [[Bell Island (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Bell Island]] became the only location in North America to be subject to direct attack by German forces in World War II.\n\n===Operation Deadlight===\n{{Main|Operation Deadlight}}\n\"Operation Deadlight\" was the code name for the scuttling of U-boats surrendered to the Allies after the defeat of Germany near the end of the war. Of the 154 U-boats surrendered, 121 were scuttled in deep water off [[Londonderry Port|Lisahally]], Northern Ireland, or [[Loch Ryan]], Scotland, in late 1945 and early 1946.\n\n==Memorial==\n[[M\u00f6ltenort U-Boat Memorial]]\n\n==Post\u2013World War II and Cold War (after 1945)==\n[[File:U15 Kieler Woche 2007 1.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''U-15'', a [[Type 206 submarine]], of the [[German Navy]] at the [[Kiel Week]] 2007]]\nFrom 1955, the West German ''[[Bundesmarine]]'' was allowed to have a small navy. Initially two sunken Type XXIIIs and a Type XXI were raised and repaired. In the 1960s, the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) re-entered the submarine business. Because West Germany was initially restricted to a 450 tonne displacement limit, the ''Bundesmarine'' focused on small [[coastal submarine]]s to protect against the [[Soviet Union]] ([[Russia]]n) threat in the [[Baltic Sea]]. The Germans sought to use advanced technologies to offset the small displacement, such as [[ferromagnetism|amagnetic]] [[steel]] to protect against [[naval mine]]s and [[magnetic anomaly detector]]s.\n\nThe initial [[Type 201 submarine|Type 201]] was a failure because of hull cracking; the subsequent [[Type 205 submarine|Type 205]], first commissioned in 1967, was a success, and 12 were built for the German navy. To continue the U-boat tradition, the new boats received the classic '''U''' designation starting with the ''U-1''.\n\nWith the [[Denmark|Danish]] government's purchase of two Type 205 boats, the West German government realized the potential for the submarine as an export, developing a customized version [[Kobben-class submarine|Type 207]]. Small and agile submarines were built during the Cold War to operate in the shallow Baltic Sea and attack Warsaw Pact resulting in the [[Type 206 submarine|Type 206]]. Three of the improved [[Type 206 submarine|Type 206]] boats were later sold to the [[Israeli Navy]], becoming the [[Gal class submarine|Type 540]]. The German [[Type 209 submarine|Type 209]] diesel-electric submarine was the most popular export-sales submarine in the world from the late 1960s into the first years of the 21st century. With a larger 1,000\u20131,500 tonne displacement, the class was very customizable and has seen service with 14 navies with 51 examples being built as of 2006. Germany would continue to reap successes with derivations or on the basis of the successful type 209, as are the [[Dolphin-class submarine|Type 800]] sold to [[Israel]] and the [[TR-1700-class submarine|TR-1700]] sold to [[Argentine]].\n\nGermany would continue to succeed as an exporter of submarines as the [[Ula-class submarine|Klasse 210]] sold to [[Norway]], considered the most silent and maneuverable submarines in the world. This would demonstrate its capacity and put its export seal on the world.\n\n[[File:U Boot 212 HDW 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Type 212 submarine]] with air-independent propulsion of the [[German Navy]] in dock at [[Howaldtswerke|HDW]]/[[Kiel]]]]\nGermany has brought the U-boat name into the 21st century with the new [[Type 212 submarine|Type 212]].

With [[Henry Royce]], he co-founded the [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] car manufacturing firm. He was the first Briton to be killed in an aeronautical accident with a powered aircraft, when the tail of his [[Wright Model A|Wright Flyer]] broke off during a flying display in [[Bournemouth]]. He was aged 32.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Charles Rolls driving medal at Monmouth Museum, Wales.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Driving medals won by Rolls, at [[Monmouth Museum]]]]\nRolls was born in [[Berkeley Square]], London, third son of the [[John Rolls, 1st Baron Llangattock|1st Baron Llangattock]] and [[Lady Llangattock]]. Despite his London birth, he retained a strong family connection with his ancestral home<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/372038 | title=The Hendre | publisher=Geograph Britain and Ireland | accessdate=29 June 2011}}</ref> of [[The Hendre]], near [[Monmouth]], Wales. After attending Mortimer Vicarage [[Preparatory school (UK)|Preparatory School]] in Berkshire, he was educated at [[Eton College]] where his developing interest in engines earned him the nickname \"dirty Rolls\".<ref name=\"The_Magic_Of_A_Name\">{{cite book | last = Pugh | first = Peter | title = The Magic of a Name \u2013 The Rolls-Royce Story: The First 40 Years | publisher = Icon Books | year = 2001 | isbn = 1-84046-151-9 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1894 he attended a private [[Cram school|crammer]] in Cambridge which helped him gain entry to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he studied mechanical and applied science. In 1896, at the age of 18, he travelled to Paris to buy his first car, a [[Peugeot]] [[Phaeton body|Phaeton]], and joined the [[French Automobile Club|Automobile Club of France]]. His Peugeot is believed to have been the first car based in Cambridge, and one of the first three cars owned in Wales. An early motoring enthusiast, he joined the Self-Propelled Traffic Association, which campaigned against the restrictions imposed on motor vehicles by the [[Locomotive Act]], and became a founder member of the [[Royal Automobile Club|Automobile Club of Great Britain]], with which the Association merged in 1897.<ref>{{cite book | last = Vance | first = James | title = Ways of the World: A History of the World's Roads and of the Vehicles That Used Them | publisher = Rutgers University Press | year = 1992 | isbn = 0-8135-2691-4 }}</ref>\n\nRolls was a keen cyclist and spent time at Cambridge bicycle racing. In 1896, he won a [[Blue (university sport)|Half Blue]] and the following year became captain of the Cambridge University Bicycle Club.<ref name=TT39323>Aeroplane Accident, Mr Rolls Killed at Bournemouth.

Rolls also had a collection of bicycles from solos up to four-man tandems.</ref>\n\nRolls graduated from Cambridge in 1898 and began working on the [[steam yacht]] ''Santa Maria'' followed by a position at the [[London and North Western Railway]] in [[Crewe]].<ref name=\"The_Magic_Of_A_Name\"/> However, his talents lay more in salesmanship and motoring pioneering than practical engineering; in January 1903, with the help of \u00a36,600 provided by his father, he started one of Britain's first car dealerships,<ref name=\"BBC\" /> C. S. Rolls & Co. based in [[Fulham]], to import and sell French [[Peugeot]] and Belgian [[Minerva (automobile)|Minerva]] vehicles.\n<!--Rolls was a tall man, standing at about 1.95 m (6'5\"). no citation, unable to verify-->\n\n==Partnership with Royce==\n[[File:Panhard & Levassor autocar, C S Rolls driver and George V.jpg|thumb|right|235px|C. S. Rolls driving [[George V of the United Kingdom|the Duke of York]] accompanied by Sir Charles Cust and Rolls' father, Lord Llangattock, at 'The Hendre', 1900]]\n{{Main|Rolls-Royce Limited}}\n\nRolls was introduced to [[Henry Royce]] by a friend at the [[Royal Automobile Club]], Henry Edmunds, who was also a director of Royce Ltd. Edmunds showed him Royce's car and arranged the historic meeting between Rolls and Royce at the [[Midland Hotel (Manchester)|Midland Hotel]], Manchester, on 4 May 1904. In spite of his preference for three or four cylinder cars, Rolls was impressed with the two-cylinder Royce 10 and in a subsequent agreement of 23 December 1904 agreed to take all the cars Royce could make. These would be of two, three, four and six cylinders and would be badged as Rolls-Royces.\n\n[[File:CharlesRolls.jpg|thumb|left|123px|Bronze bust at [[Derby Industrial Museum]]]]\nThe first Rolls-Royce car, the [[Rolls-Royce 10 hp]], was unveiled at the [[Paris Motor Show|Paris Salon]] in December 1904, although in the early advertising it was the name of Rolls that was emphasised over that of Royce. In 1906 Rolls and Royce formalised their partnership by creating Rolls-Royce Limited, with Rolls appointed Technical managing director on a salary of \u00a3750 per annum plus 4% of the profits in excess of \u00a310,000. Rolls provided the financial backing and business acumen to complement Royce's technical expertise. In 1907 Rolls-Royce Limited bought out C. S. Rolls & Co.\n\nRolls put much effort into publicising the quietness and smoothness of the Rolls-Royce, and at the end of 1906 travelled to the US to promote the new cars. The company was winning awards for the quality and reliability of its cars by 1907. But by 1909 Rolls' interest in the business was waning, and at the end of the year he resigned as Technical managing director and became a [[non-executive director]].<ref name=\"The_Magic_Of_A_Name\"/>\n\n[[File:The late C.S.

In 1903 he won the [[James Gordon Bennett Jr.|Gordon Bennett]] Gold Medal for the longest single flight time.\n\nBy 1907 Rolls' interest turned increasingly to flying and he tried to persuade Royce to design an aero engine. He became the second Englishman to go up in an aeroplane.

With [[Henry Royce]], he co-founded the [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] car manufacturing firm. He was the first Briton to be killed in an aeronautical accident with a powered aircraft, when the tail of his [[Wright Model A|Wright Flyer]] broke off during a flying display in [[Bournemouth]]. He was aged 32.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Charles Rolls driving medal at Monmouth Museum, Wales.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Driving medals won by Rolls, at [[Monmouth Museum]]]]\nRolls was born in [[Berkeley Square]], London, third son of the [[John Rolls, 1st Baron Llangattock|1st Baron Llangattock]] and [[Lady Llangattock]]. Despite his London birth, he retained a strong family connection with his ancestral home<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/372038 | title=The Hendre | publisher=Geograph Britain and Ireland | accessdate=29 June 2011}}</ref> of [[The Hendre]], near [[Monmouth]], Wales. After attending Mortimer Vicarage [[Preparatory school (UK)|Preparatory School]] in Berkshire, he was educated at [[Eton College]] where his developing interest in engines earned him the nickname \"dirty Rolls\".<ref name=\"The_Magic_Of_A_Name\">{{cite book | last = Pugh | first = Peter | title = The Magic of a Name \u2013 The Rolls-Royce Story: The First 40 Years | publisher = Icon Books | year = 2001 | isbn = 1-84046-151-9 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1894 he attended a private [[Cram school|crammer]] in Cambridge which helped him gain entry to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he studied mechanical and applied science. In 1896, at the age of 18, he travelled to Paris to buy his first car, a [[Peugeot]] [[Phaeton body|Phaeton]], and joined the [[French Automobile Club|Automobile Club of France]]. His Peugeot is believed to have been the first car based in Cambridge, and one of the first three cars owned in Wales. An early motoring enthusiast, he joined the Self-Propelled Traffic Association, which campaigned against the restrictions imposed on motor vehicles by the [[Locomotive Act]], and became a founder member of the [[Royal Automobile Club|Automobile Club of Great Britain]], with which the Association merged in 1897.<ref>{{cite book | last = Vance | first = James | title = Ways of the World: A History of the World's Roads and of the Vehicles That Used Them | publisher = Rutgers University Press | year = 1992 | isbn = 0-8135-2691-4 }}</ref>\n\nRolls was a keen cyclist and spent time at Cambridge bicycle racing. In 1896, he won a [[Blue (university sport)|Half Blue]] and the following year became captain of the Cambridge University Bicycle Club.<ref name=TT39323>Aeroplane Accident, Mr Rolls Killed at Bournemouth.

S. Rolls & Co. based in [[Fulham]], to import and sell French [[Peugeot]] and Belgian [[Minerva (automobile)|Minerva]] vehicles.\n<!--Rolls was a tall man, standing at about 1.95 m (6'5\"). no citation, unable to verify-->\n\n==Partnership with Royce==\n[[File:Panhard & Levassor autocar, C S Rolls driver and George V.jpg|thumb|right|235px|C.

Edmunds showed him Royce's car and arranged the historic meeting between Rolls and Royce at the [[Midland Hotel (Manchester)|Midland Hotel]], Manchester, on 4 May 1904. In spite of his preference for three or four cylinder cars, Rolls was impressed with the two-cylinder Royce 10 and in a subsequent agreement of 23 December 1904 agreed to take all the cars Royce could make. These would be of two, three, four and six cylinders and would be badged as Rolls-Royces.\n\n[[File:CharlesRolls.jpg|thumb|left|123px|Bronze bust at [[Derby Industrial Museum]]]]\nThe first Rolls-Royce car, the [[Rolls-Royce 10 hp]], was unveiled at the [[Paris Motor Show|Paris Salon]] in December 1904, although in the early advertising it was the name of Rolls that was emphasised over that of Royce. In 1906 Rolls and Royce formalised their partnership by creating Rolls-Royce Limited, with Rolls appointed Technical managing director on a salary of \u00a3750 per annum plus 4% of the profits in excess of \u00a310,000. Rolls provided the financial backing and business acumen to complement Royce's technical expertise. In 1907 Rolls-Royce Limited bought out C. S. Rolls & Co.\n\nRolls put much effort into publicising the quietness and smoothness of the Rolls-Royce, and at the end of 1906 travelled to the US to promote the new cars. The company was winning awards for the quality and reliability of its cars by 1907. But by 1909 Rolls' interest in the business was waning, and at the end of the year he resigned as Technical managing director and became a [[non-executive director]].<ref name=\"The_Magic_Of_A_Name\"/>\n\n[[File:The late C.S.

He later went on to attend ADT College (now [[Ashcroft Technology Academy]]) in [[Putney]]. Example has claimed in interviews that the main reason he started rapping was due to his introduction to [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] through albums by [[Wu-Tang Clan]] and [[Snoop Dogg]] \u2013 the latter's album purchased primarily for \"the cool cover art\", and to the fact that he was not particularly good at any sports, so started rapping to fit in socially. His first experience of rapping was through a rap battle at a house party in [[Shepherd's Bush]] in 1994, when he was 12 years old. In that battle, he, in his own words, \"completely destroyed a useless wanker and a fight broke out so (he) sprinted home\".\n\nGleave went on to study BA Media Arts at [[Royal Holloway, University of London]], graduating in 2003. It was during this period that he met Joseph Gardner, AKA Rusher, the producer whom he would go on to work with during his time releasing tracks independently through his All The Chats imprint, and later on Mike Skinner's label The Beats. Gleave and Gardner made a concept album in the audio booth of the University film department; this concept album contained the track which would go on to be Example's first white-label vinyl release, \"A Pointless Song.\"\n\nHe returned to the UK and became a voiceover artist and editor for the [[Comedy Central (UK and Ireland)|Paramount Comedy Channel]] (now Comedy Central),<ref>[http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/music/article-23999465-the-fulham-rapper-leading-by-example.do The Fulham rapper leading by Example \u2013 Music \u2013 Arts \u2013 Evening Standard] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224134912/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/music/article-23999465-the-fulham-rapper-leading-by-example.do |date=24 February 2012 }}.

He later went on to attend ADT College (now [[Ashcroft Technology Academy]]) in [[Putney]]. Example has claimed in interviews that the main reason he started rapping was due to his introduction to [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] through albums by [[Wu-Tang Clan]] and [[Snoop Dogg]] \u2013 the latter's album purchased primarily for \"the cool cover art\", and to the fact that he was not particularly good at any sports, so started rapping to fit in socially. His first experience of rapping was through a rap battle at a house party in [[Shepherd's Bush]] in 1994, when he was 12 years old. In that battle, he, in his own words, \"completely destroyed a useless wanker and a fight broke out so (he) sprinted home\".\n\nGleave went on to study BA Media Arts at [[Royal Holloway, University of London]], graduating in 2003. It was during this period that he met Joseph Gardner, AKA Rusher, the producer whom he would go on to work with during his time releasing tracks independently through his All The Chats imprint, and later on Mike Skinner's label The Beats. Gleave and Gardner made a concept album in the audio booth of the University film department; this concept album contained the track which would go on to be Example's first white-label vinyl release, \"A Pointless Song.\"\n\nHe returned to the UK and became a voiceover artist and editor for the [[Comedy Central (UK and Ireland)|Paramount Comedy Channel]] (now Comedy Central),<ref>[http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/music/article-23999465-the-fulham-rapper-leading-by-example.do The Fulham rapper leading by Example \u2013 Music \u2013 Arts \u2013 Evening Standard] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224134912/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/music/article-23999465-the-fulham-rapper-leading-by-example.do |date=24 February 2012 }}.

His first 'proper' release on The Beats was \"What We Made\" in November 2006, the video for which was filmed in [[Chernobyl]], [[Ukraine]] (see [[#Film making|below]]).\n\t\nExample's second official Beats single entitled \"You Can't Rap\" was released in March 2007, followed by a re-release of \"I Don't Want To\" on 11 June 2007. \"I Don't Want To\" was followed by the single \"So Many Roads\" (famously sampling [[The Carpenters]] \"We've Only Just Begun\") which eventually turned out to be the opening track on Example's full-length studio debut. After the demise of The Beats label at the end of 2007 Example self-released his next single \"Me + Mandy\" on 10 March 2008 through his original imprint All The Chats. The video for \"Me + Mandy\" was shot over four days and nights in London, in over 30 locations with over 40 extras. This was done at a cost of just \u00a31000. It was directed by Example's friend Henry Scholfield who also made the promos for \"Who Needs Sunshine?\", \"Vile\", \"You Can't Rap\" and \"I Don't Want To\".\n\t\nIn February 2008 Example also tried his hand at stand-up comedy as part of [[BBC2]]'s [[The Culture Show]].

Greater noctule bats are the only bat species to hunt birds on the wing rather than when roosting.

Echolocation is a perceptual system where echoes are produced by emitting ultrasonic sounds. Echolocation allows bats to compare the outgoing pulse with returning echoes which produces detailed images of the bat's surroundings. With echolocation, bats are able to detect, localize and classify their prey in complete darkness.<ref name=\"IB\"/> The greater noctule bat has been observed as only emerging from its roosts well after dusk when it is completely dark.<ref name=\"DO\"/> The greater noctule bat has keen hearing and sense of smell, however its eyes are poorly developed.\n\nThe wings of the greater noctule bat are thinner than those of birds which allow it to maneuver quickly and accurately. While its wing is delicate and rips easily, it is able to regrow. The greater noctule is the largest bat in Europe, with a wingspan of {{convert|41|-|46|cm|in|abbr=on}}. Its head-and-body length is from {{convert|8.4|to|10.4|cm|in|abbr=on}}, its tail is from  {{convert|5.5|to|6.6|cm|in|abbr=on}} and its forearm ranges from {{convert|6.2|to|6.8|cm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"IB\"/> The body mass of adults ranges from {{convert|41|to|76|g|oz|abbr=on}}.<ref> Macdonald, D.W. & Barrett, P. 1993.</ref> The greater noctule bat has been observed as a high altitude flier and a low altitude forager.<ref name=\"DO\"/> The dorsal fur of the greater noctule bat is uniformly reddish-brown to dark brown.

''N. lasiopterus'', as a ''Nyctalus'' species, has an outstanding capability for [[Animal migration|migration]] which can possibly result in considerable seasonal changes in sex ratio. The studies in North-East Hungary indicates that the sex-ratio differs greatly depending on the location. Males were exceedingly dominant in Greece and the Czech Republic while females were dominant in NE Germany, the Moscow-region, Voronezh, and NE Hungary. This sexual segregation is due to difference in sex-specific thermoregulatory and energetic requirements. The females are dominant in warmer locations because it is optimal for fetal development and milk production.

No other country in Europe has a specific endangered status for the greater noctule bat.\n\n===Conservation proposals===\n\nThe organism separates itself socially and spatially with roosts.<ref name=\"FO\"/> A colony has several roosts, with most of the populations centered in one large roost and several fringe roosts which other bat species may share. These are useful for sharing information between colonies.These roosts however can communicate disease and parasites.<ref name=\"FO\"/> The individuals often fly from one roost to another to exchange information, and this also creates a pathway for infection. For reasons uncertain, such as being perhaps too advantageous to the colony, they continue to roost within these trees despite the disadvantages to themselves.<ref name=\"FO\"/>  It would be beneficial to the conservation of the species to locate the trees with roosts that have high levels of disease/ parasite infections in addition to high rates of transfers between roosts and cut them down to lessen the rate of infection among them.The functions of each roost also needs to be identified, as to understand which roosts would be better left intact.<ref name=\"FO\"/>  However, only day roosts studies were performed, and further research into their nocturnal habits may be required.\n\nThe species has not yet been well defined in their areas of roosting.<ref name=\"ES1\"/> Some have even been found to roost in caves and possibly housing, though whether this is typical behavior or an effect of displacement is uncertain.<ref name=\"ES1\"/> Tracking the species by radio signals, it was found that the species prefers older, larger trees, specifically beeches, perhaps due to possessing relatively spacious trunks and branches, allowing for ease of entry. The species does not have one specific roost, but a network through which the colony can rotate individuals.<ref name=\"ES1\"/> Recent years have seen less reliance on fossil fuels and rather relying on wood as a source of energy, and consequently an increase in logging, therefore it is important to locate the areas in which they roosts to identify those which should be protected to prevent their decline, through which radio tracking proves an effective method.<ref name=\"ES1\"/>\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Literature cited==\n*\n*Dondini, G. & Vergari, S. 2000.

No other country in Europe has a specific endangered status for the greater noctule bat.\n\n===Conservation proposals===\n\nThe organism separates itself socially and spatially with roosts.<ref name=\"FO\"/> A colony has several roosts, with most of the populations centered in one large roost and several fringe roosts which other bat species may share. These are useful for sharing information between colonies.These roosts however can communicate disease and parasites.<ref name=\"FO\"/> The individuals often fly from one roost to another to exchange information, and this also creates a pathway for infection. For reasons uncertain, such as being perhaps too advantageous to the colony, they continue to roost within these trees despite the disadvantages to themselves.<ref name=\"FO\"/>  It would be beneficial to the conservation of the species to locate the trees with roosts that have high levels of disease/ parasite infections in addition to high rates of transfers between roosts and cut them down to lessen the rate of infection among them.The functions of each roost also needs to be identified, as to understand which roosts would be better left intact.<ref name=\"FO\"/>  However, only day roosts studies were performed, and further research into their nocturnal habits may be required.\n\nThe species has not yet been well defined in their areas of roosting.<ref name=\"ES1\"/> Some have even been found to roost in caves and possibly housing, though whether this is typical behavior or an effect of displacement is uncertain.<ref name=\"ES1\"/> Tracking the species by radio signals, it was found that the species prefers older, larger trees, specifically beeches, perhaps due to possessing relatively spacious trunks and branches, allowing for ease of entry. The species does not have one specific roost, but a network through which the colony can rotate individuals.<ref name=\"ES1\"/> Recent years have seen less reliance on fossil fuels and rather relying on wood as a source of energy, and consequently an increase in logging, therefore it is important to locate the areas in which they roosts to identify those which should be protected to prevent their decline, through which radio tracking proves an effective method.<ref name=\"ES1\"/>\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Literature cited==\n*\n*Dondini, G. & Vergari, S. 2000.
