The reality that we talk about could always be 'out there', but still the 'unconscious' that we can never get explored totally is only an area to be explored by arts. Malaka has brilliantly examined the unconscious dimension of contemporary consumerist society, its human subjectivity and political economy in many ways shedding lights on some chosen characters from our own environment'.\u2018Malaka's attempt in a way fills the vacuum created by artists in the caliber of [[Sugathapala de Silva]] and [[Henry Jayasena]] who consciously used their creations to expose the ideology and politics underpinning the social and economic system forced on our lives by history's circumstances. So, the art of the epoch have to be conscious of such circumstances and the dialectical forces of the history and thereby work for liberating the human beings from the agonizing political, social, cultural and economic circumstances enforced on their lives. And Malaka Dewapriya belongs to that rare caliber of artists who have identified the human potential of making history of their choice and also the need for conscious effort towards such transformations'.}}</ref>\n\n: {{cite book|last=Dewapriya|first=Malaka|title=Magical Festival: A Radio Drama|series=Colecci\u00f3n nueva narrativa y poes\u00eda sudaca border a\u00f1o 2007|publisher=Buenos Aires: [[:de:Elo\u00edsa Cartonera|Elo\u00edsa Cartonera]], 2007|oclc=233002160}} (Corrugated board bindings.)<ref name=details>{{cite book|title=Item Details|work=[[OCLC]]|publisher=[[WorldCat]]|oclc = 233002160}}</ref><ref name=WorldCatID>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/wcpa/oclc/233002160?page=frame&url=%2fidentities%2ffind%3furl_ver%3dZ39.88-2004%26rft_val_fmt%3dinfo%3aofi%2ffmt%3akev%3amtx%3aidentity%26rft.namelast%3dDe%25CC%2584vapriya%26rft.namefirst%3dMa%25CC%2584laka.%26rft.nameinit%3dM%26rft.nameinit1%3dM%26rft.nameinitm%3d%26rft.namesuffix%3d%26rft.nametitle%3d%26rft.date%3d%26rft.name%3d%26rft.birthdate%3d%26rft.deathdate%3d%26rft.arn%3d%26rft.title%3dMagical%2bfestival%2b%252F%26rft_id%3dinfo%3aoclcnum%2f233002160&title=&linktype=identitiesLink|title=D\u0113vapriya, M\u0101laka|work=Identities (Beta)|format=[[World Wide Web|Web]]|publisher=[[WorldCat]]|accessdate=13 February 2009}}</ref>\n\n: {{cite book|last=Dewapriya|first=Malaka|title=Uge Hisa Ivarai (Off with His Head)|series=Radio Drama Collection|publisher=Kolamba: M\u0101laka D\u0113vapriya [sic], 2006|isbn=978-955-99772-0-9}} (Author publication in [[Sinhalese language|Sinhalese]]).<ref name=WorldCatID/><ref name=RadioPlays>Malaka Dewapriya is both author and publisher; publication sponsored by Book Developing Fund of the [[National Library of Sri Lanka]].</ref><ref name=RadioPlays3>See also the National Library and Documentation Centre{{cite web|url=http://panhinda.natlib.lk/scripts/AfWiInq.dll?Details?action=0&site=0&brlk=1106510|title=Uge Hisa Ivarai: Radio Drama Collection|work= National Library and Documentation Centre-AfW Internet Inquiry|format=[[World Wide Web|Web]]|publisher= natlib |accessdate=18 March 2010|quote=Description198p. ; 20cm; Subjects-Radoi plays Sinhalese drama; {{ISBN|978-955-99772-0-9}} ; SupplierBook Development Project ; NLC NLC 891.482 DEV; Barcode-112016; Accession No-112016 }}</ref><ref name=RadioPlays2>See also the collected radio dramas mentioned by Dewapriya in {{cite web|url=http://www.mal.s5.com/about.html|title=Uge Hisa Ivarai: Radio Drama Collection|work=Personal Website|format=[[World Wide Web|Web]]|publisher=Malaka Dewapriya|accessdate=16 February 2009|quote=Devapriya has collected eleven [sic] of his [[Sinhalese language|Sinhala]] radio plays broadcast over the last ten [sic] years. \u2026 Note: Prof. [[Sunanda Mahendra]] writes that there are ten plays broadcast over the last three years.

The reality that we talk about could always be 'out there', but still the 'unconscious' that we can never get explored totally is only an area to be explored by arts. Malaka has brilliantly examined the unconscious dimension of contemporary consumerist society, its human subjectivity and political economy in many ways shedding lights on some chosen characters from our own environment'.\u2018Malaka's attempt in a way fills the vacuum created by artists in the caliber of [[Sugathapala de Silva]] and [[Henry Jayasena]] who consciously used their creations to expose the ideology and politics underpinning the social and economic system forced on our lives by history's circumstances. So, the art of the epoch have to be conscious of such circumstances and the dialectical forces of the history and thereby work for liberating the human beings from the agonizing political, social, cultural and economic circumstances enforced on their lives. And Malaka Dewapriya belongs to that rare caliber of artists who have identified the human potential of making history of their choice and also the need for conscious effort towards such transformations'.}}</ref>\n\n: {{cite book|last=Dewapriya|first=Malaka|title=Magical Festival: A Radio Drama|series=Colecci\u00f3n nueva narrativa y poes\u00eda sudaca border a\u00f1o 2007|publisher=Buenos Aires: [[:de:Elo\u00edsa Cartonera|Elo\u00edsa Cartonera]], 2007|oclc=233002160}} (Corrugated board bindings.)<ref name=details>{{cite book|title=Item Details|work=[[OCLC]]|publisher=[[WorldCat]]|oclc = 233002160}}</ref><ref name=WorldCatID>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/wcpa/oclc/233002160?page=frame&url=%2fidentities%2ffind%3furl_ver%3dZ39.88-2004%26rft_val_fmt%3dinfo%3aofi%2ffmt%3akev%3amtx%3aidentity%26rft.namelast%3dDe%25CC%2584vapriya%26rft.namefirst%3dMa%25CC%2584laka.%26rft.nameinit%3dM%26rft.nameinit1%3dM%26rft.nameinitm%3d%26rft.namesuffix%3d%26rft.nametitle%3d%26rft.date%3d%26rft.name%3d%26rft.birthdate%3d%26rft.deathdate%3d%26rft.arn%3d%26rft.title%3dMagical%2bfestival%2b%252F%26rft_id%3dinfo%3aoclcnum%2f233002160&title=&linktype=identitiesLink|title=D\u0113vapriya, M\u0101laka|work=Identities (Beta)|format=[[World Wide Web|Web]]|publisher=[[WorldCat]]|accessdate=13 February 2009}}</ref>\n\n: {{cite book|last=Dewapriya|first=Malaka|title=Uge Hisa Ivarai (Off with His Head)|series=Radio Drama Collection|publisher=Kolamba: M\u0101laka D\u0113vapriya [sic], 2006|isbn=978-955-99772-0-9}} (Author publication in [[Sinhalese language|Sinhalese]]).<ref name=WorldCatID/><ref name=RadioPlays>Malaka Dewapriya is both author and publisher; publication sponsored by Book Developing Fund of the [[National Library of Sri Lanka]].</ref><ref name=RadioPlays3>See also the National Library and Documentation Centre{{cite web|url=http://panhinda.natlib.lk/scripts/AfWiInq.dll?Details?action=0&site=0&brlk=1106510|title=Uge Hisa Ivarai: Radio Drama Collection|work= National Library and Documentation Centre-AfW Internet Inquiry|format=[[World Wide Web|Web]]|publisher= natlib |accessdate=18 March 2010|quote=Description198p. ; 20cm; Subjects-Radoi plays Sinhalese drama; {{ISBN|978-955-99772-0-9}} ; SupplierBook Development Project ; NLC NLC 891.482 DEV; Barcode-112016; Accession No-112016 }}</ref><ref name=RadioPlays2>See also the collected radio dramas mentioned by Dewapriya in {{cite web|url=http://www.mal.s5.com/about.html|title=Uge Hisa Ivarai: Radio Drama Collection|work=Personal Website|format=[[World Wide Web|Web]]|publisher=Malaka Dewapriya|accessdate=16 February 2009|quote=Devapriya has collected eleven [sic] of his [[Sinhalese language|Sinhala]] radio plays broadcast over the last ten [sic] years. \u2026 Note: Prof. [[Sunanda Mahendra]] writes that there are ten plays broadcast over the last three years.

When Zuko tells the group that Ozai plans to use the comet's power to burn down the Earth Kingdom, Aang resolves to face him before the comet arrives. Sokka decides to have a [[simulation]] fight against a scarecrow, but Aang refuses to kill it due to his [[Pacifism|pacifistic]] nature and [[Nonviolence|non-violent]] upbringing, and even berates his friends after they pointedly tell him that he has no choice but to kill Ozai.\n\nThat night, Aang [[Sleepwalking|sleepwalks]] to an offshore island that disappears in the morning. After the group fails to locate him, Zuko takes them to June, a [[tracking (hunting)|tracker]] who might be able to locate Aang. Meanwhile, Fire Lord Ozai proclaims himself to be ruler of the world, under the title \"[[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix]] King\", and declares Azula to be the new Fire Lord, setting off with an airship fleet to burn the world and rebuild it under his new order.\n\n===Part 2: \"The Old Masters\"===\nZuko's tracker, June, is unable to locate Aang, but he is reunited with his uncle, [[Iroh]], and they reconcile after Zuko's earlier betrayal. It is revealed that he, along with other characters encountered in previous episodes, are part of an otherwise non-aligned [[secret society]] known as the \"Order of the White Lotus\", which plans to liberate the Earth Kingdom capital city from Fire Nation rule. Zuko and [[Katara (Avatar: The Last Airbender)|Katara]] decide to fight Azula in the Fire Nation capital while Sokka, Toph, and Suki prepare to destroy the airship fleet. Meanwhile, Aang awakens on a floating island. Frustrated with his inability to find a way to defeat Ozai without killing him, he asks four of his past lives for advice. Unsatisfied with their answers, he asks the island for help. The island, which is actually a giant \"lion turtle\", bestows upon Aang the power of energybending and leaves him on the shores of the Earth Kingdom while Ozai arrives with his airship fleet.\n\n===Part 3: \"Into the Inferno\"===\n\nThe Comet appears in the sky, and Azula's coronation takes place. Azula banishes nearly all of her subjects, haunted by the betrayals of former friends Mai and Ty Lee. Her paranoia and loneliness begin to drive her insane. Before she is crowned, Zuko and Katara arrive. Zuko accepts Azula's challenge to a one-on-one duel because he realizes Azula is distracted and he does not want Katara injured. Just as Zuko is on the verge of defeating Azula, she shoots a bolt of lightning at an unprepared Katara. Zuko throws himself in front of her and intercepts the lightning, preventing Katara from getting hurt, but gravely injuring himself.\n\nMeanwhile, Sokka, Toph, and Suki hijack a Fire Nation airship, and use it to destroy Ozai's airship fleet, crippling his forces before they can burn down the Earth Kingdom. In Ba Sing Se, the Order of the White Lotus, led by Iroh, lays siege to the Fire Nation forces within the city, with the intention of re-conquering it in the name of the Earth Kingdom. Aang reappears and begins to duel the Phoenix King. When Aang refuses to kill Ozai despite an opportunity, Ozai begins to gain an advantage in the fight.\n\n===Part 4: \"Avatar Aang\"===\nZuko lies on the ground while Katara and Azula fight. Katara manages to freeze Azula in a block of ice before chaining her to a drainage grate. Katara then uses her waterbending to revive and heal Zuko. As a result of her defeat, Azula's mind finally snaps entirely and she screams and sobs in fury, unable to escape from her chains. Meanwhile, the Order of the White Lotus successfully liberates Ba Sing Se in the name of the Earth King.\n\nAfter a fierce battle, Ozai slams Aang into a rock, hitting the scar on his back from Azula's lightning in the previous season and inadvertently releasing his locked [[Sahasrara|seventh chakra]], allowing Aang to enter the Avatar State. With the combined power of his [[Reincarnation|past lives]], Aang quickly overwhelms Ozai but refuses to kill him. After subduing Ozai, Aang finally understands the lion-turtle's meaning and uses energybending to strip Ozai of his Firebending powers, removing his ability to wage war while Sozin's Comet vanishes beyond the horizon. During his [[coronation]], Zuko promises to aid the world in the postwar reconstruction. A final scene depicts the main cast gathered in Iroh's new tea shop, while Aang and Katara finally begin a romantic relationship.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Energybending.PNG|thumb|right|A new elemental bending technique, energybending, is introduced.

Konietzko originally pitched the scene to DiMartino and Ehasz, but the three of them encountered difficulties communicating how the scene would look. They ended up drawing a fully colored storyboard to send to the animation studios.<ref name=\"newsweek10\"/> Additionally, the finale featured a significant amount of fire compared to previous episodes, and were all hand-drawn by Yoo's team. Dos Santos observed that the fire effects alone cost more than most shows spend on an entire season.<ref name=\"newsweek10\"/> Although ''Avatar'' is not considered [[anime]] because of its American origin, Tasha Robinson of the [[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|SciFi Channel]] observed that \"''Avatar'' blurs the line between anime and [US] domestic cartoons until it becomes irrelevant.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/anime/sfw12366.html|title=SciFi Channel Anime Review|author=Robinson, Tasha|accessdate=2006-10-16|work=SciFi}}</ref> An [[IGN]] reviewer commented that \"Sozin's Comet\" \"had that classic anime-look that I've always loved to see when watching old anime movies.

The scene's pairing of moody and melancholic music with intense action was inspired by ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'', and a decision was made to quiet the sound effects to let the music set the tone was inspired by ''[[Blade Runner]]''.<ref name=\"newsweek10\"/>\n\n''Avatar: The Last Airbender'' borrows extensively from [[History of Eastern art|East Asian art]] to create its fictional universe.<ref name=\"nytimes\">{{cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/28/arts/television/28lass.html?ei=5090&en=2d9845c5b0133bb9&ex=1282881600&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss&pagewanted=all|title = Kung Fu Fightin' Anime Stars, Born in the U.S.A.|accessdate = 2006-12-02|author = Lasswell, Mark|date=2005-08-25|newspaper = The New York Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.nicksplat.com/Whatsup/200510/12000135.html|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071217111256/http://www.nicksplat.com/Whatsup/200510/12000135.html|archivedate=2007-12-17|title = Interview With The Creators|accessdate = 2006-12-02|date=2005-10-12|publisher = NickSplat.com}}</ref> Four \"bending\" arts exist in the universe; they are based on different styles and variations of [[Chinese martial arts]]: [[Baguazhang]] for airbending, [[Hung Gar]] and [[Southern Praying Mantis]] for earthbending, [[Northern Shaolin]] for firebending, and [[T'ai chi ch'uan|T'ai chi]] for waterbending.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.nick.com/shows/avatar/index.jhtml|title = Nickelodeon's Official Avatar: The Last Airbender Flash Site|accessdate = 2009-03-18|publisher = [[Nick.com]]|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nick.com%2Fshows%2Favatar%2Findex.jhtml&date=2009-03-18|archivedate=2009-03-18}}</ref> The fight scenes were choreographed by Sifu Kisu, who performed and filed every fight sequence with Konietzko to serve as reference for the animators.<ref name=\"newsweek10\"/> Additionally, the finale borrowed heavily from the [[Taoist]] concept of balance and order.

When Zuko tells the group that Ozai plans to use the comet's power to burn down the Earth Kingdom, Aang resolves to face him before the comet arrives. Sokka decides to have a [[simulation]] fight against a scarecrow, but Aang refuses to kill it due to his [[Pacifism|pacifistic]] nature and [[Nonviolence|non-violent]] upbringing, and even berates his friends after they pointedly tell him that he has no choice but to kill Ozai.\n\nThat night, Aang [[Sleepwalking|sleepwalks]] to an offshore island that disappears in the morning. After the group fails to locate him, Zuko takes them to June, a [[tracking (hunting)|tracker]] who might be able to locate Aang. Meanwhile, Fire Lord Ozai proclaims himself to be ruler of the world, under the title \"[[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix]] King\", and declares Azula to be the new Fire Lord, setting off with an airship fleet to burn the world and rebuild it under his new order.\n\n===Part 2: \"The Old Masters\"===\nZuko's tracker, June, is unable to locate Aang, but he is reunited with his uncle, [[Iroh]], and they reconcile after Zuko's earlier betrayal. It is revealed that he, along with other characters encountered in previous episodes, are part of an otherwise non-aligned [[secret society]] known as the \"Order of the White Lotus\", which plans to liberate the Earth Kingdom capital city from Fire Nation rule. Zuko and [[Katara (Avatar: The Last Airbender)|Katara]] decide to fight Azula in the Fire Nation capital while Sokka, Toph, and Suki prepare to destroy the airship fleet. Meanwhile, Aang awakens on a floating island. Frustrated with his inability to find a way to defeat Ozai without killing him, he asks four of his past lives for advice. Unsatisfied with their answers, he asks the island for help. The island, which is actually a giant \"lion turtle\", bestows upon Aang the power of energybending and leaves him on the shores of the Earth Kingdom while Ozai arrives with his airship fleet.\n\n===Part 3: \"Into the Inferno\"===\n\nThe Comet appears in the sky, and Azula's coronation takes place. Azula banishes nearly all of her subjects, haunted by the betrayals of former friends Mai and Ty Lee. Her paranoia and loneliness begin to drive her insane. Before she is crowned, Zuko and Katara arrive. Zuko accepts Azula's challenge to a one-on-one duel because he realizes Azula is distracted and he does not want Katara injured. Just as Zuko is on the verge of defeating Azula, she shoots a bolt of lightning at an unprepared Katara. Zuko throws himself in front of her and intercepts the lightning, preventing Katara from getting hurt, but gravely injuring himself.\n\nMeanwhile, Sokka, Toph, and Suki hijack a Fire Nation airship, and use it to destroy Ozai's airship fleet, crippling his forces before they can burn down the Earth Kingdom. In Ba Sing Se, the Order of the White Lotus, led by Iroh, lays siege to the Fire Nation forces within the city, with the intention of re-conquering it in the name of the Earth Kingdom. Aang reappears and begins to duel the Phoenix King. When Aang refuses to kill Ozai despite an opportunity, Ozai begins to gain an advantage in the fight.\n\n===Part 4: \"Avatar Aang\"===\nZuko lies on the ground while Katara and Azula fight. Katara manages to freeze Azula in a block of ice before chaining her to a drainage grate. Katara then uses her waterbending to revive and heal Zuko. As a result of her defeat, Azula's mind finally snaps entirely and she screams and sobs in fury, unable to escape from her chains. Meanwhile, the Order of the White Lotus successfully liberates Ba Sing Se in the name of the Earth King.\n\nAfter a fierce battle, Ozai slams Aang into a rock, hitting the scar on his back from Azula's lightning in the previous season and inadvertently releasing his locked [[Sahasrara|seventh chakra]], allowing Aang to enter the Avatar State. With the combined power of his [[Reincarnation|past lives]], Aang quickly overwhelms Ozai but refuses to kill him. After subduing Ozai, Aang finally understands the lion-turtle's meaning and uses energybending to strip Ozai of his Firebending powers, removing his ability to wage war while Sozin's Comet vanishes beyond the horizon. During his [[coronation]], Zuko promises to aid the world in the postwar reconstruction. A final scene depicts the main cast gathered in Iroh's new tea shop, while Aang and Katara finally begin a romantic relationship.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Energybending.PNG|thumb|right|A new elemental bending technique, energybending, is introduced.

Konietzko originally pitched the scene to DiMartino and Ehasz, but the three of them encountered difficulties communicating how the scene would look. They ended up drawing a fully colored storyboard to send to the animation studios.<ref name=\"newsweek10\"/> Additionally, the finale featured a significant amount of fire compared to previous episodes, and were all hand-drawn by Yoo's team. Dos Santos observed that the fire effects alone cost more than most shows spend on an entire season.<ref name=\"newsweek10\"/> Although ''Avatar'' is not considered [[anime]] because of its American origin, Tasha Robinson of the [[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|SciFi Channel]] observed that \"''Avatar'' blurs the line between anime and [US] domestic cartoons until it becomes irrelevant.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/anime/sfw12366.html|title=SciFi Channel Anime Review|author=Robinson, Tasha|accessdate=2006-10-16|work=SciFi}}</ref> An [[IGN]] reviewer commented that ''Sozin's Comet'' \"had that classic anime-look that I've always loved to see when watching old anime movies. The story through the animation was perfectly done.\"<ref name=\"IGN\"/>\n\nThe finale's music was written and composed by \"The Track Team\", led by [[Jeremy Zuckerman]].<ref name=\"prod\"/> Unlike past episodes, a music track produced by a live orchestra was used, rather than one in [[MIDI]] format.<ref name=\"dvdcomment3\" /> According to Konietzko, one of the most challenging scenes to pair musically was the Agni Kai duel between Zuko and Azula. The scene's pairing of moody and melancholic music with intense action was inspired by ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'', and a decision was made to quiet the sound effects to let the music set the tone was inspired by ''[[Blade Runner]]''.<ref name=\"newsweek10\"/>\n\n''Avatar: The Last Airbender'' borrows extensively from [[History of Eastern art|East Asian art]] to create its fictional universe.<ref name=\"nytimes\">{{cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/28/arts/television/28lass.html?ei=5090&en=2d9845c5b0133bb9&ex=1282881600&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss&pagewanted=all|title = Kung Fu Fightin' Anime Stars, Born in the U.S.A.|accessdate = 2006-12-02|author = Lasswell, Mark|date=2005-08-25|newspaper = The New York Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.nicksplat.com/Whatsup/200510/12000135.html|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071217111256/http://www.nicksplat.com/Whatsup/200510/12000135.html|archivedate=2007-12-17|title = Interview With The Creators|accessdate = 2006-12-02|date=2005-10-12|publisher = NickSplat.com}}</ref> Four \"bending\" arts exist in the universe; they are based on different styles and variations of [[Chinese martial arts]]: [[Baguazhang]] for airbending, [[Hung Gar]] and [[Southern Praying Mantis]] for earthbending, [[Northern Shaolin]] for firebending, and [[T'ai chi ch'uan|T'ai chi]] for waterbending.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.nick.com/shows/avatar/index.jhtml|title = Nickelodeon's Official Avatar: The Last Airbender Flash Site|accessdate = 2009-03-18|publisher = [[Nick.com]]|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nick.com%2Fshows%2Favatar%2Findex.jhtml&date=2009-03-18|archivedate=2009-03-18}}</ref> The fight scenes were choreographed by Sifu Kisu, who performed and filed every fight sequence with Konietzko to serve as reference for the animators.<ref name=\"newsweek10\"/> Additionally, the finale borrowed heavily from the [[Taoist]] concept of balance and order.

They were placed in high risk locations and fought in the battle that took the city of Anzio in Italy]]\nThe '''Battle of Anzio''' was a battle of the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]] of [[World War II]] that took place from January 22, 1944 (beginning with the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] amphibious landing known as '''Operation Shingle''') to June 5, 1944 (ending  with the capture of Rome). The operation was opposed by German forces in the area of [[Anzio]] and [[Nettuno]].<ref>At the time joined in a single ''[[comune]]'' called [[Nettunia]].

Lucas]], of the [[U.S. Army]], commanding [[VI Corps (United States)|U.S. VI Corps]] with the intention being to outflank German forces at the [[Winter Line]] and enable an attack on [[Rome]].\n\nThe success of an amphibious landing at that location, in a basin consisting substantially of reclaimed [[marshland]] and surrounded by mountains, depended on the element of surprise and the swiftness with which the invaders could build up strength and move inland relative to the reaction time and strength of the defenders. Any delay could result in the occupation of the mountains by the defenders and the consequent entrapment of the invaders. Lieutenant General [[Mark W. Clark]], commander of the [[United States Army North|U.S. Fifth Army]], understood that risk, but he did not pass on his appreciation of the situation to his subordinate, {{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Lucas, who preferred to take time to entrench against an expected counterattack. The initial landing achieved complete surprise with no opposition and a jeep patrol even made it as far as the outskirts of Rome. However, Lucas, who had little confidence in the operation as planned, failed to capitalize on the element of surprise and delayed his advance until he judged his position was sufficiently consolidated and he had sufficient strength.\n\nWhile Lucas consolidated, Field Marshal [[Albert Kesselring]], the German commander in the Italian theatre, moved every unit he could spare into a defensive ring around the [[beachhead]]. His artillery units had a clear view of every Allied position. The Germans also stopped the drainage pumps and flooded the reclaimed marsh with salt water, planning to entrap the Allies and destroy them by [[epidemic]]. For weeks a rain of shells fell on the beach, the marsh, the harbour, and on anything else observable from the hills, with little distinction between forward and rear positions.\n\nAfter a month of heavy but inconclusive fighting, Lucas was relieved and sent home. His replacement was Major General [[Lucian Truscott]], who had previously commanded the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division. The Allies broke out in May. But, instead of striking inland to cut lines of communication of the [[10th Army (Wehrmacht)|German Tenth Army]]'s units [[Battle of Monte Cassino|fighting at Monte Cassino]], Truscott, on Clark's orders, reluctantly turned his forces north-west towards Rome, which was captured on June 4, 1944. As a result, the forces of the German Tenth Army fighting at Cassino were able to withdraw and rejoin the rest of Kesselring's forces north of Rome, regroup, and make a fighting withdrawal to his next major prepared defensive position on the [[Gothic Line]].\n\n==Background==\n{{refimprove section|date=January 2017}}\nAt the end of 1943, following the [[Allied invasion of Italy]], Allied forces were bogged down at the [[Gustav Line]], a defensive line across Italy south of the strategic objective of Rome. The [[Geography of Italy|terrain of central Italy]] had proved ideally suited to defense, and Field Marshal [[Albert Kesselring]] took full advantage.\n\nOperation Shingle was originally conceived by British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] in December 1943, as he lay recovering from [[pneumonia]] in [[Marrakesh]]. His concept was to land two divisions at Anzio, bypassing German forces in central Italy, and take Rome, the strategic objective of the current Battle of Rome.<ref>{{harvnb|Atkinson|2008|p=321}}</ref> By January he had recovered and was badgering his commanders for a plan of attack, accusing them of not wanting to fight but of being interested only in drawing pay and eating rations.<ref>{{harvnb|Atkinson|2008|p=322}}</ref> General [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|Harold Alexander]], commander of the [[Allied Armies in Italy]], had already considered such a plan since October using five divisions. However, the 5th Army did not have the troops nor the means to transport them. Clark proposed landing a reinforced division to divert German troops from [[Battle of Monte Cassino|Monte Cassino]]. This second landing, however, instead of failing similarly{{clarify|date=April 2018}}, would hold <ref>{{cite web|title=Battle of Anzio|url=http://www.worldwar2facts.org/battle-of-anzio.html|work=World War II Facts|accessdate=21 January 2014}}</ref> \"the shingle\" for a week in expectation of a breakthrough at Cassino, and so the operation was named Shingle.<ref>{{harvnb|Atkinson|2008|p=323}}</ref>\n\nThe Anzio beachhead is at the northwestern end of a tract of reclaimed marshland, formerly the [[Pontine Marshes]], now the Pontine Fields (Agro Pontino). Previously uninhabitable due to mosquitoes carrying [[malaria]], in Roman times armies marched as quickly as possible across it on the military road, the [[Via Appia]]. The marsh was bounded on one side by the sea and on others by mountains: the Monti Albani, the [[Monti Lepini]], the [[Monti Ausoni]] and further south the [[Monti Aurunci]] (where the allies had been brought to a halt before [[Monte Cassino]]). Overall these mountains are referenced by the name Monti Laziali, the mountains of [[Lazio]], the ancient [[Latium]]. Invading armies from the south had the choice of crossing the marsh or taking the only other road to Rome, the [[Via Latina]], running along the eastern flanks of the Monti Laziali, risking entrapment. The marshes were turned into cultivatable land in the 1930s under [[Benito Mussolini]]. Canals and pumping stations were built to remove the brackish water from the land. These canals divided the land into personal tracts with new stone houses for colonists from north Italy. Mussolini also founded the five cities destroyed by the battle.\n\nWhen [[Lucian Truscott]]'s [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|3rd Division]] was first selected for the operation, he pointed out to Clark that the position was a death trap and there would be no survivors. Agreeing, Clark canceled the operation, but Prime Minister Churchill revived it. Apparently the two allies had different concepts: the Americans viewed such a landing as another distraction from Cassino, but if they could not break through at Cassino, the men at Anzio would be trapped. Churchill and the British high command envisioned an outflanking movement ending with the capture of Rome. [[Allied Forces Headquarters|Mediterranean Theatre]] commander General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], leaving to take command of [[Operation Overlord]], left the decision up to Churchill with a warning about German unpredictability.<ref>{{harvnb|Atkinson|2008|p=324}}</ref> \n\nThe final plan called for Lucas to lead the US [[VI Corps (United States)|VI Corps]] in a landing in the Anzio area, followed by an advance into the [[Alban Hills]], to cut German communications and \"threaten the rear of the German XIV [[Panzer Corps]]\"{{cn|date=October 2019}} (under [[Fridolin von Senger und Etterlin]]). It was hoped that such an advance would draw German forces away from the Monte Cassino area and facilitate an Allied breakthrough there.\n\n==Plan==\nPlanners argued that if Kesselring (in charge of German forces in Italy) pulled troops out of the [[Gustav Line]] to defend against the Allied assault, then Allied forces would be able to break through the line; if Kesselring didn't pull troops out of the Gustav Line, then Operation Shingle would threaten to capture Rome and cut off the German units defending the Gustav Line. Should Germany have adequate reinforcements available to defend both Rome and the Gustav Line, the Allies felt that the operation would nevertheless be useful in engaging forces which could otherwise be committed on another front. The operation was officially canceled on December 18, 1943. However, it was later reselected.\n\nClark did not feel he had the numbers on the southern front to exploit any breakthrough. His plan therefore was relying on the southern offensive drawing Kesselring's reserves in and providing the Anzio force the opportunity to break inland quickly. This would also reflect the orders he had received from Alexander to \"...{{nbsp}}carry out an assault landing on the beaches in the vicinity of Rome with the object of cutting the enemy lines of communication and threatening the rear of the German XIV&nbsp;Corps [on the Gustav Line].\"<ref name=\"LC69\">{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=69}}</ref> However, his written orders to Lucas did not really reflect this. Initially Lucas had received orders to \"1. Seize and secure a [[beachhead]] in the vicinity of Anzio 2. Advance and secure Colli Laziali [the Alban Hills] 3. Be prepared to advance on Rome\".<ref name=\"LC69\"/> However, Clark's final orders stated \"...{{nbsp}}2. Advance on Colli Laziali\"<ref name=\"LC77\"/> giving Lucas considerable flexibility as to the timing of any advance on the Alban Hills. It is likely that the caution displayed by both Clark and Lucas was to some extent a product of Clark's experiences at the tough battle for the Salerno beach head<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=85}}</ref> and Lucas' natural caution stemming from his lack of experience in battle.\n\nNeither Clark nor Lucas had full confidence in either their superiors or the operational plan.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|pp=70\u201371}}</ref> Along with most of the Fifth Army staff they felt that ''Shingle'' was properly a two corps or even a full army task.<ref name=\"LC76\">{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=76}}</ref> A few days prior to the attack, Lucas wrote in his diary, \"They will end up putting me ashore with inadequate forces and get me in a serious jam... Then, who will get the blame?\"<ref name=\"LC77\">{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=77}}</ref> and \"[The operation] has a strong odour of [[Battle of Gallipoli|Gallipoli]] and apparently the same amateur was still on the coach's bench.\"<ref name=\"LC76\"/> The \"amateur\" can only have referred to Winston Churchill, architect of the disastrous Gallipoli landings of World War I and personal advocate of ''Shingle''.\n\n===Availability of naval forces===\nOne of the problems with the plan was the availability of [[landing ship]]s. The American commanders in particular were determined that nothing should delay the Normandy invasion and the supporting [[Operation Dragoon|landings in southern France]]. Operation Shingle would require the use of landing ships necessary for these operations. Initially ''Shingle'' was to release these assets by January&nbsp;15. However, this being deemed problematic, President Roosevelt granted permission for the craft to remain until February&nbsp;5.\n\nOnly enough [[Landing Ship, Tank|tank landing ships]] (LSTs) to land a single division were initially available to ''Shingle''. Later, at Churchill's personal insistence, enough were made available to land two divisions. Allied intelligence thought that five or six German divisions were in the area, although U.S. 5th Army intelligence severely underestimated the German 10th Army's fighting capacity at the time, believing many of their units would be worn out after the defensive battles fought since September.\n\n===Order of battle===\n{{Further|Anzio order of battle}}\n\n'''Task Force 81''' \n{{multiple image\n | direction = horizontal\n | width     = 140\n | header    = Allied naval commanders for Operation Shingle\n | image1    = Frank_J._Lowry.jpg\n | caption1  = Rear Adm.

However, these plans were scrapped on 20 January, apparently because of the high losses during the airborne assaults at Sicily. The 504th PIR was then assigned to land by sea.</ref>\n\n=== Southern attack ===\n{{Main|Battle of Monte Cassino}}\nThe Fifth Army's attack on the Gustav Line began on January 16, 1944, at [[Battle of Monte Cassino|Monte Cassino]]. The operation failed to break through, but it partly succeeded in its primary objective. Heinrich von Vietinghoff, commanding the Gustav Line, called for reinforcements, and Kesselring transferred the [[29th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|29th]] and [[90th Light Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|90th Panzergrenadier Divisions]] from Rome.\n\n== Battle ==\n\n==={{anchor|Operation Shingle}} Initial landings===\n<!-- linked from redirect [[Operation Shingle]] -->\n[[Image:Cassino+Anzio1943JanFeb.jpg|thumb|Force dispositions at Anzio and Cassino January / February 1944]]\nThe landings began on January 22, 1944.\n\nAlthough resistance had been expected, as seen at [[Operation Avalanche (World War II)#Salerno landings|Salerno]] during 1943, the initial landings were essentially unopposed, with the exception of desultory ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' strafing runs.\n\nBy midnight, 36,000 soldiers and 3,200 vehicles had landed on the beaches. Thirteen Allied troops were killed, and 97&nbsp;wounded; about 200 Germans had been taken as [[POWs]].<ref>{{harvnb|Laurie|1994|p=9}}</ref> The 1st Division penetrated {{convert|2|miles|sigfig=1}} inland, the Rangers captured Anzio's port, the 509th PIB captured Nettuno, and the 3rd Division penetrated {{convert|3|miles|sigfig=1}} inland.\n\nIn the first days of operations, the command of the [[Italian resistance movement]] had a meeting with the Allied General Headquarters: it offered to guide the Allied Force through the [[Alban Hills]] territory, but the Allied Command refused the proposal.\n\n=== After the landings ===\nIt is clear that Lucas' superiors expected some kind of offensive action from him. The point of the landing was to turn the German defences on the Winter Line, taking advantage of their exposed rear and hopefully panicking them into retreating northwards past Rome. However, Lucas instead poured more men and material into his tiny bridgehead, and strengthened his defences.\n\nWinston Churchill was clearly displeased with this action. He said: \"I had hoped we were hurling a wildcat into the shore, but all we got was a stranded whale\".<ref>{{harvnb|Colville|2004|p=456}}</ref>\n\nLucas' decision remains a controversial one. Noted military historian [[John Keegan]] wrote, \"Had Lucas risked rushing at Rome the first day, his spearheads would probably have arrived, though they would have soon been crushed. Nevertheless he might have 'staked out claims well inland.'<ref>John Keegan, ''The Second World War', Penguin Books; Reprint edition 2005, {{ISBN|978-0143035732}}, p. 357</ref> \"However, Lucas did not have confidence in the strategic planning of the operation. Also, he could certainly argue that his interpretation of his orders from Clark was not an unreasonable one. With two divisions landed, and facing two or three times that many Germans, it would have been reasonable for Lucas to consider the beachhead insecure. But according to Keegan, Lucas's actions \"achieved the worst of both worlds, exposing his forces to risk without imposing any on the enemy.\"\n\n=== Response of Axis forces ===\n[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J16897, Italien, Nettuno, britische Kriegsgefangene, Verwundete.jpg|thumb|220px|British POWs near Nettuno]]\nKesselring was informed of the landings at 3 a.m. January 22. Although the landings came as a surprise, Kesselring had made contingency plans to deal with possible landings at all the likely locations. All the plans relied on his divisions each having previously organised a motorized rapid reaction unit (''Kampfgruppe'') which could move speedily to meet the threat and buy time for the rest of the defenses to get in place.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=83}}</ref> At 5 a.m. he initiated Operation \"Richard\" and ordered the ''Kampfgruppe'' of [[4th Parachute Division (Germany)|4th Parachute Division]] and the [[Fallschirm-Panzer Division 1 Hermann G\u00f6ring|Hermann G\u00f6ring Panzer Division]] to defend the roads leading from Anzio to the [[Alban Hills]] via [[Aprilia, Lazio|Campoleone]] and [[Battle of Cisterna|Cisterna]] whilst his plans expected some 20,000 defending troops to have arrived by the end of the first day. In addition, he requested that [[OKW]] send reinforcements, and in response to this they ordered the equivalent of more than three divisions from France, [[Yugoslavia]], and Germany whilst at the same time releasing to Kesselring a further three divisions in Italy which had been under OKW's direct command.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=101}}</ref> Later that morning, he ordered General [[Eberhard von Mackensen]] ([[14th Army (Wehrmacht)|Fourteenth Army]]) and General [[Heinrich von Vietinghoff]] ([[10th Army (Wehrmacht)|Tenth Army]] \u2013 Gustav Line) to send him additional reinforcements.\n\nThe German units in the immediate vicinity had in fact been dispatched to reinforce the Gustav Line only a few days earlier. All available reserves from the southern front or on their way to it were rushed toward Anzio and Nettuno; these included the [[3rd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|3rd Panzer Grenadier]] and [[71st Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|71st Infantry Divisions]], and the bulk of the Luftwaffe's Hermann G\u00f6ring Panzer Division. Kesselring initially considered that a successful defence could not be made if the Allies launched a major attack on January&nbsp;23 or January&nbsp;24. However, by the end of January&nbsp;22, the lack of aggressive action convinced him that a defence could be made. Nevertheless, few additional defenders arrived on January&nbsp;23, although the arrival on the evening of January&nbsp;22 of Lieutenant General [[Alfred Schlemm]] and his 1st&nbsp;Parachute Corps headquarters brought greater organisation and purpose to the German defensive preparations. By January&nbsp;24, however, the Germans had over 40,000 troops in prepared defensive positions.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=123}}</ref>\n\nThree days after the landings, the beachhead was surrounded by a defence line consisting of three divisions: The 4th Parachute Division to the west, the 3rd Panzer Grenadier Division to the center in front of Alban Hills, the Hermann G\u00f6ring Panzer Division to the east.\n\nVon Mackensen's 14th Army assumed overall control of the defence on January&nbsp;25. Elements of eight German divisions were employed in the defence line around the beachhead, and five more divisions were on their way to the Anzio area. Kesselring ordered an attack on the beachhead for January&nbsp;28, though it was postponed to February&nbsp;1.\n\n=== Liberty ship involvement===\n[[Liberty ship]]s, which were never intended as warships, were involved in some fighting during the battle of Anzio. On 22 to 30 January 1944 the {{SS|Lawton B. Evans}} was under repeated bombardment from shore batteries and aircraft throughout an eight-day period. It endured a prolonged barrage of shrapnel, machine-gun fire and bombs. The gun crew fought back with shellfire and shot down five German planes.<ref>{{citation|title=[[:commons:File:SS_Lawton_B._Evans_Commendation.pdf|Pers-68-MH MM/822 62 83]]|date=1944-06-24 |publisher=[[Bureau of Naval Personnel]] |work=commons.wikimedia.org }}</ref>\n\n=== Allied offensive ===\n[[Image:Anzio1944-02-01.jpg|thumb|Allied force dispositions on 1 February 1944]]\nFurther troop movements including the arrival of [[45th Infantry Division (United States)|U.S. 45th Infantry Division]] and [[1st Armored Division (United States)|U.S. 1st Armored Division]], brought Allied forces total on the beachhead to 69,000&nbsp;men, 508&nbsp;guns and 208&nbsp;tanks by January&nbsp;29, whilst the total defending Germans had risen to 71,500.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=134}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=136}}</ref> Lucas initiated a two-pronged attack on January&nbsp;30.

On the right, ahead of the main assault, two Ranger battalions made a daring covert advance towards Cisterna (see [[Battle of Cisterna]]). Due to faulty intelligence, when daylight arrived they were engaged and cut off. A brutal battle with elements of the [[Fallschirm-Panzer Division 1 Hermann G\u00f6ring|Hermann G\u00f6ring]] division followed. Rangers began surrendering individually or in small groups prompting others, acting on their own authority, to shoot them. Of the 767&nbsp;men in the 1st and 3rd&nbsp;Ranger Battalions, 6 returned to the Allied lines and 761 were killed or captured.<ref>{{harvnb|King|1985|loc=Ch 4}}</ref>\n\n===German counterattacks===\nBy early February, German forces in Fourteenth Army numbered some 100,000 troops organised into two Army Corps, the 1st&nbsp;Parachute Corps under Schlemm and the [[LXXVI&nbsp;Panzer Corps]] under Lieutenant General [[Traugott Herr]]. Allied forces by this time totalled 76,400 (including the recently arrived [[56th (London) Infantry Division|British 56th Infantry Division]], under Major-General [[Gerald Templer]], which arrived complete on February 16).<ref name=\"LLoyd158\">{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=158}}</ref> After making exploratory probes on the Campoleone salient on the afternoon of February&nbsp;3 the German forces launched a full counterattack at 23:00<ref name=\"LLoyd160\">{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=160}}</ref> in order to reduce the salient and \"iron out\" the front line.<ref name=\"LLoyd158\"/> Von&nbsp;Mackensen had planned for the salient to be ground away rather than employing a rapid, focused thrust to cut it off. Some hours after the attack started the coherence of the front line had been completely shattered, and the fighting for the salient had given way to small unit actions, swaying back and forth through the gullies. In the morning of February&nbsp;4 the situation was becoming more serious, with the 1st Battalion, [[Irish Guards]] (of [[24th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|24th Guards Brigade]]), only having one cohesive [[Company (military unit)|rifle company]] left and on the opposite side of the salient, the 6th Battalion, [[Gordon Highlanders]] (of [[2nd Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|2nd Brigade]]) was beginning to crumble and later lost three complete companies as [[Prisoner of war|prisoners]].<ref>D'Este, p. 200.</ref>\n\nEven though the base of the salient was nearly broken, Lucas was able to bolster the British 1st Division's defenses with the newly arrived [[168th (2nd London) Brigade|168th Brigade]] (from the 56th Division, containing 1st Battalion, [[London Irish Rifles]], 1st Battalion, [[London Scottish (regiment)|London Scottish]], 10th Battalion, [[Royal Berkshire Regiment]]).<ref name=\"LLoyd162\">{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=162}}</ref> The [[3rd Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|3rd Brigade]] had been tasked with holding the tip of the salient 2 miles long and 1,000 yards wide on the road going north of Campoleone, but after the German attacks in the early hours of 4 February, the 2nd Battalion, [[Sherwood Foresters]], 1st Battalion, [[King's Shropshire Light Infantry]] and 1st Battalion, [[Duke of Wellington's Regiment]] (all of 3rd Brigade) had been cut off and were surrounded in the pocket.

However, a counterattack using VI&nbsp;Corps' reserves halted the German advance, and on February 20, ''Fischfang'' petered out with both sides exhausted. During ''Fischfang'' the Germans had sustained some 5,400 casualties, the Allies 3,500. Both had suffered nearly 20,000 casualties each since the first landings,<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|pp=175\u2013197}}</ref> and it was ''\"far the highest density of destruction in the Italian campaign, perhaps in the whole war\"''.<ref name=\"Blaxland, p. 48\">{{harvnb|Blaxland||p=48}}</ref> Also on February&nbsp;18 while returning to Anzio the light cruiser {{HMS|Penelope|97|6}} was struck by two torpedoes and sunk with a loss of 417&nbsp;men.

In anticipation of the following spring, Kesselring ordered the preparation of a new defence line, the [[Caesar C line]], behind the line of beachhead running from the mouth of the river [[Tiber]] just south of Rome through [[Albano Laziale|Albano]], skirting south of the Alban Hills to [[Valmontone]] and across Italy to the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coast at [[Pescara]], behind which 14th Army and, to their left, 10th Army might withdraw when the need arose.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|pp=219\u2013220}}</ref> Meanwhile, [[Lucian Truscott]], who had been promoted from the command of U.S. 3rd&nbsp;Infantry Division to replace Lucas as commander of VI&nbsp;Corps on February&nbsp;22, worked with his staff on the plans for a decisive attack as part of a general offensive which Alexander was planning for May and which would include a major offensive on the Gustav Line, [[Operation Diadem]]. The objective of the plan was to fully engage Kesselring's armies with a major offensive and remove any prospect of the Germans withdrawing forces from Italy to redeploy elsewhere. It was also intended to trap the bulk of the German 10th Army between the Allied forces advancing through the Gustav Line and VI&nbsp;Corps thrusting inland from Anzio.\n\nIn March, the 2nd Italian SS \"Vendetta\" Battalion and 29th Italian SS Rifle Battalion were sent to fight against the Anglo-American forces at the Anzio beachhead. Dispersed among German battalions, the German commanding officers later gave the Italians companies favourable reports. Members of former Blackshirt Lieutenant-Colonel Degli Oddi's \"Vendetta\" helped defeat a determined effort by the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division to overrun their positions and captured a number of prisoners.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Their  performance at Anzio led to designation as units of the Waffen-SS, with all the duties and rights that that entailed.<ref>{{harvnb|Williamson|Stephen|2004|pp=18\u201319}}</ref>\n\nThe next few weeks saw many changes in divisions on both sides. The [[504th Infantry Regiment (United States)|U.S. 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment]], which had fought with distinction but suffered heavy losses, was withdrawn to England on 23 March 1944. Also in March the [[34th Infantry Division (United States)|U.S. 34th Infantry Division]] and in early May, [[36th Infantry Division (United States)|U.S. 36th Infantry Division]], had arrived at Anzio. On the British side the [[24th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|24th Guards Brigade]] of [[1st Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|British 1st Infantry Division]] was replaced in the first week of March by [[18th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|18th Infantry Brigade]] (from [[1st (United Kingdom) Division|British 1st Armoured Division]] in North Africa). The Guards Brigade had suffered devastating casualties (nearly 2,000 of an initial strength of over 2,500) in just less than two months at Anzio.<ref name=\"Blaxland, p. 48\"/> In late March the [[56th (London) Division|56th (London) Infantry Division]] had also been relieved, after sustaining very heavy losses (one of its battalions \u2014 7th [[Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry|Ox and Bucks]] of [[167th (1st London) Brigade|167th (London) Brigade]] \u2014 had been reduced from 1,000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/stories/33/a3603133.shtml|title=BBC \u2013 WW2 People's War \u2013 Oxs and Bucks at Anzio|website=www.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=5 September 2017}}</ref> to 60), by [[5th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|British 5th Infantry Division]]. By late May, there were some 150,000 Allied troops in the bridgehead,<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=281}}</ref> including five U.S. and two British divisions, facing five German divisions. The Germans were well dug into prepared defenses, but were weak in numbers of officers and NCOs and, by the time of the late May offensive, lacked any reserves (which had all been sent south to the Gustav fighting).<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=271}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:AnzioCassino1944May.jpg|thumb|The Allied breakout from Anzio and advance from the Gustav Line May 1944.]]\n\nDespite Alexander's overall plan for ''Diadem'' requiring VI Corps to strike inland and cut Route&nbsp;6, Clark asked Truscott to prepare alternatives and to be ready to switch from one to another at 48&nbsp;hours' notice. Of the four scenarios prepared by Truscott, Operation Buffalo called for an attack through Cisterna, into the gap in the hills and to cut Route&nbsp;6 at Valmontone. Operation Turtle on the other hand foresaw a main thrust to the left of the Alban Hills taking Campoleone, Albano and on to Rome. On May&nbsp;5, Alexander selected ''Buffalo'' and issued Clark with orders to this effect.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|pp=271\u2013272}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Clark was determined that VI Corps should strike directly for Rome as evidenced in his later writing: \"We not only wanted the honor of capturing Rome, but felt that we deserved it...

Kesselring, however, was convinced that the Allies' intentions were to gain Route&nbsp;6 and ordered the Hermann G\u00f6ring Panzer Division, resting  {{convert|150|miles}} away at [[Livorno]],<ref name=\"Leghorn\" group=nb>Livorno is referred to as \"Leghorn\" in contemporary Allied maps and documents</ref> to Valmontone to hold open Route&nbsp;6 for the Tenth Army, which was retreating up this road from Cassino.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=291}}</ref>\n\nIn the afternoon of May 25, Cisterna finally fell to 3rd Division who had to go house to house winkling out the German 362nd&nbsp;Infantry which had refused to withdraw and, as a consequence, had virtually ceased to exist by the end of the day. By the end of May&nbsp;25, 3rd&nbsp;Infantry were heading into the Velletri gap near [[Cori, Lazio|Cori]], and elements of 1st Armored had reached within {{convert|3|mi}} of Valmontone and were in contact with units of the Herman G\u00f6ring Division which were just starting to arrive from Leghorn.<ref name=\"Leghorn\" group=nb/> Although VI&nbsp;Corps had suffered over 3,300 casualties in the three days fighting, Operation Buffalo was going to plan, and Truscott was confident that a concerted attack by 1st&nbsp;Armored and 3rd&nbsp;Infantry Divisions the next day would get his troops astride Route&nbsp;6.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=300}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Anzio1944May-June.jpg|thumb|The final move on Rome]]\nOn the evening of May 25, Truscott received new orders from Clark via his Operations Officer, Brigadier General Don Brand. These were, in effect, to implement Operation Turtle and turn the main line of attack 90 degrees to the left. Most importantly, although the attack towards Valmontone and Route&nbsp;6 would continue, 1st&nbsp;Armored were to withdraw to prepare to exploit the planned breakthrough along the new line of attack leaving 3rd&nbsp;Division to continue towards [[Valmontone]] with 1st Special Service Force in support.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=301}}</ref> Clark informed Alexander of these developments late in the morning of May&nbsp;26 by which time the change of orders was a ''fait accompli''.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=302}}</ref>\n\nAt the time, Truscott was shocked, writing later\n\n<blockquote>...I was dumbfounded. This was no time to drive to the north-west where the enemy was still strong; we should pour our maximum power into the Valmontone Gap to insure the destruction of the retreating German Army. I would not comply with the order without first talking to General Clark in person. ... [However] he was not on the beachhead and could not be reached even by radio... such was the order that turned the main effort of the beachhead forces from the Valmontone Gap and prevented destruction of the German Tenth Army. On the 26th the order was put into effect.<ref>{{harvnb|Majdalany|1957|p= 256}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHe went on to write\n\n<blockquote>There has never been any doubt in my mind that had General Clark held loyally to General Alexander's instructions, had he not changed the direction of my attack to the north-west on May&nbsp;26, the strategic objectives of Anzio would have been accomplished in full. To be first in Rome was a poor compensation for this lost opportunity.<ref>{{harvnb|Majdalany|1957| p=259}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nOn May 26, while the VI Corps was initiating its difficult maneuver, Kesselring threw elements of four divisions into the Velletri gap to stall the advance on Route&nbsp;6. For four days they slugged it out against 3rd Division until finally withdrawing on May&nbsp;30, having kept Route&nbsp;6 open and allowed seven divisions from 10th&nbsp;Army to withdraw and head north of Rome.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=304}}</ref>\n\nOn the new axis of attack little progress was made until 1st Armored were in position on May&nbsp;29, when the front advanced to the main Caesar C Line defences. Nevertheless, an early breakthrough seemed unlikely until on May&nbsp;30 Major General [[Fred L. Walker]]'s [[36th Infantry Division (United States)|36th Division]] found a gap in the Caesar Line at the join between 1st&nbsp;Parachute Corps and LXXVI&nbsp;Panzer Corps. Climbing the steep slopes of Monte Artemisio they threatened Velletri from the rear and obliged the defenders to withdraw. This was a key turning point, and von&nbsp;Mackensen offered his resignation which Kesselring accepted.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=307}}</ref>\n\nRaising the pressure further, Clark assigned [[II Corps (United States)|U.S. II Corps]] which, fighting its way along the coast from the Gustav Line, had joined up with VI&nbsp;Corps on May&nbsp;25 to attack around the right hand side of the Alban Hills and advance along the line of Route&nbsp;6 to Rome.\n\nOn June 2 the Caesar Line collapsed under the mounting pressure, and 14th Army commenced a fighting withdrawal through Rome. On the same day Hitler, fearing another Stalingrad, had ordered Kesslering that there should be \"no defence of Rome\".<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=311}}</ref> Over the next day, the rearguards were gradually overwhelmed, and Rome was entered in the early hours of June&nbsp;4 with Clark holding an impromptu press conference on the steps of the Town Hall on the [[Capitoline Hill]] that morning. He ensured the event was a strictly American affair by stationing military police at road junctions to refuse entry to the city by British military personnel.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|pp=309\u2013319}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:The British Army in Italy 1944 NA11058.jpg|thumb|British soldier guards a group of German prisoners at Anzio, 22 January 1944]]\nAlthough controversy continues regarding what might have happened if Lucas had been more aggressive from the start, most commentators agree that the initial plan for Anzio was flawed. They question whether the initial landing of just over two infantry divisions, with no supporting armour, had the strength to achieve the objectives: of cutting Route 6 and then holding off the inevitable counterattacks that would come, as Kesselring redeployed his forces.\n\nVolume 5 of Churchill's ''The Second World War'' is riddled with implied criticism of Lucas blaming the failure on his caution. After the war, Kesselring gave his evaluation:\n\n{{quote|It would have been the Anglo-American doom to overextend themselves. The landing force was initially weak, only a division or so of infantry, and without armour. It was a halfway measure of an offensive; that was your basic error.<ref Name=\"Lloyd325\">{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=325}}</ref>}}\n\nFurthermore, Field Marshal Sir [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|Harold Alexander]], in his Official Dispatch, stated, \"The actual course of events was probably the most advantageous in the end.\"<ref Name=\"Lloyd325\"/>\n\nChurchill defended the operation<ref>{{harvnb|Churchill|1985|p=436}}</ref> and believed that sufficient forces were available. He had clearly made great political efforts to procure certain resources, especially the extra [[Landing Ship, Tank|LSTs]] needed to deliver a second division to shore, but also specific units useful to the attack such as with the [[504th Infantry Regiment (United States)|504th Parachute Infantry Regiment]]. He argued that even regardless of the tactical outcome of the operation, there was immediate strategic benefit with regard to the wider war. After the landings, the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|German High Command]] dropped its plans to transfer five of Kesselring's best divisions to [[Western Front (World War II)|Northwestern Europe]]. That obviously benefited the upcoming [[Operation Overlord]]. Churchill also had to ensure the British-dominated forces in Italy were contributing to the war at a time when the Soviet [[Red Army]] were suffering tremendous losses on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].\n\nBecause of Clark's change of plan, [[Operation Diadem]] (during which the [[United States Army North|U.S. Fifth Army]] and the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]] sustained 44,000 casualties) failed in its objective of destroying the [[10th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 10th Army]]. It also condemned the Allies to another year of bloody combat in Italy, notably around the [[Gothic Line]] from August 1944 through March 1945.\n\nThe greatest loss was that if the [[VI Corps (United States)|U.S. Army VI Corps]] main effort had continued on the [[Valmontone]] axis from May 26, Clark could probably have reached Rome more quickly than by the route northwest from Cisterna. The VI Corps could also have cut Highway 6 and then put much more pressure on the 10th Army than it actually did.<ref>{{harvnb|Mathews|2000|p=363}}</ref>\n\n[[Alan Whicker]] who as a war correspondent with the British Army's Film and Photo Unit, and who was present during the fighting, later said:\n\n{{quote|After breaking out of Anzio, Alexander's plan was for the Fifth Army to drive east to cut Kesselring's escape route to the north and trap much of his Tenth and Fourteenth Armies. The operation started well, but then suddenly, when leading troops were only six kilometers from closing their trap at [[Frosinone]], the Fifth Army was re-directed and sent north towards Rome. The trap was left open. General Mark Clark was so eager that the world should see pictures showing him as the liberator of Rome, that he allowed the armies of a delighted Kesselring to escape.\n\nHe had ignored the orders of Field Marshall Alexander in a decision as militarily stupid as it was insubordinate.\n\nThis, vain-glorious blunder, the worst of the entire war, lost us a stunning victory, lengthened the war by many months and earned Mark Clark the contempt of other American and British generals. They saw an operation that could have won the war in Italy, thrown away at the cost of many Allied lives, because of the obsession and vanity of one man.\n\nIf General Mark Clark had been in the German Army, Hitler would have had him shot.|Alan Whicker <ref>''Whicker's War'' Part Two \"The Survivor\", Insight Television, 2004.</ref>}}\n\n==Notable participants==\n* [[Brigadier General (Lieutenant colonel at the time) Felix L.

They were placed in high risk locations and fought in the battle that took the city of Anzio in Italy]]\nThe '''Battle of Anzio''' was a battle of the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]] of [[World War II]] that took place from January 22, 1944 (beginning with the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] amphibious landing known as '''Operation Shingle''') to June 5, 1944 (ending  with the capture of Rome). The operation was opposed by German forces in the area of [[Anzio]] and [[Nettuno]].<ref>At the time joined in a single ''[[comune]]'' called [[Nettunia]].

Lucas]], of the U.S. Army]], commanding [[VI Corps (United States)|U.S. VI Corps]] with the intention being to outflank German forces at the [[Winter Line]] and enable an attack on [[Rome]].\n\nThe success of an amphibious landing at that location, in a basin consisting substantially of reclaimed [[marshland]] and surrounded by mountains, depended on the element of surprise and the swiftness with which the invaders could build up strength and move inland relative to the reaction time and strength of the defenders. Any delay could result in the occupation of the mountains by the defenders and the consequent entrapment of the invaders. Lieutenant General [[Mark W. Clark]], commander of the [[United States Army North|U.S. Fifth Army]], understood that risk, but he did not pass on his appreciation of the situation to his subordinate, {{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Lucas, who preferred to take time to entrench against an expected counterattack. The initial landing achieved complete surprise with no opposition and a jeep patrol even made it as far as the outskirts of Rome. However, Lucas, who had little confidence in the operation as planned, failed to capitalize on the element of surprise and delayed his advance until he judged his position was sufficiently consolidated and he had sufficient strength.\n\nWhile Lucas consolidated, Field Marshal [[Albert Kesselring]], the German commander in the Italian theatre, moved every unit he could spare into a defensive ring around the [[beachhead]]. His artillery units had a clear view of every Allied position. The Germans also stopped the drainage pumps and flooded the reclaimed marsh with salt water, planning to entrap the Allies and destroy them by [[epidemic]]. For weeks a rain of shells fell on the beach, the marsh, the harbour, and on anything else observable from the hills, with little distinction between forward and rear positions.\n\nAfter a month of heavy but inconclusive fighting, Lucas was relieved and sent home. His replacement was Major General [[Lucian Truscott]], who had previously commanded the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division. The Allies broke out in May. But, instead of striking inland to cut lines of communication of the [[10th Army (Wehrmacht)|German Tenth Army]]'s units [[Battle of Monte Cassino|fighting at Monte Cassino]], Truscott, on Clark's orders, reluctantly turned his forces north-west towards Rome, which was captured on June 4, 1944. As a result, the forces of the German Tenth Army fighting at Cassino were able to withdraw and rejoin the rest of Kesselring's forces north of Rome, regroup, and make a fighting withdrawal to his next major prepared defensive position on the [[Gothic Line]].\n\n==Background==\n{{refimprove section|date=January 2017}}\nAt the end of 1943, following the [[Allied invasion of Italy]], Allied forces were bogged down at the [[Gustav Line]], a defensive line across Italy south of the strategic objective of Rome. The [[Geography of Italy|terrain of central Italy]] had proved ideally suited to defense, and Field Marshal [[Albert Kesselring]] took full advantage.\n\nOperation Shingle was originally conceived by British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] in December 1943, as he lay recovering from [[pneumonia]] in [[Marrakesh]]. His concept was to land two divisions at Anzio, bypassing German forces in central Italy, and take Rome, the strategic objective of the current Battle of Rome.<ref>{{harvnb|Atkinson|2008|p=321}}</ref> By January he had recovered and was badgering his commanders for a plan of attack, accusing them of not wanting to fight but of being interested only in drawing pay and eating rations.<ref>{{harvnb|Atkinson|2008|p=322}}</ref> General [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|Harold Alexander]], commander of the [[Allied Armies in Italy]], had already considered such a plan since October using five divisions. However, the 5th Army did not have the troops nor the means to transport them. Clark proposed landing a reinforced division to divert German troops from [[Battle of Monte Cassino|Monte Cassino]]. This second landing, however, instead of failing similarly{{clarify|date=April 2018}}, would hold <ref>{{cite web|title=Battle of Anzio|url=http://www.worldwar2facts.org/battle-of-anzio.html|work=World War II Facts|accessdate=21 January 2014}}</ref> \"the shingle\" for a week in expectation of a breakthrough at Cassino, and so the operation was named Shingle.<ref>{{harvnb|Atkinson|2008|p=323}}</ref>\n\nThe Anzio beachhead is at the northwestern end of a tract of reclaimed marshland, formerly the [[Pontine Marshes]], now the Pontine Fields (Agro Pontino). Previously uninhabitable due to mosquitoes carrying [[malaria]], in Roman times armies marched as quickly as possible across it on the military road, the [[Via Appia]]. The marsh was bounded on one side by the sea and on others by mountains: the Monti Albani, the [[Monti Lepini]], the [[Monti Ausoni]] and further south the [[Monti Aurunci]] (where the allies had been brought to a halt before [[Monte Cassino]]). Overall these mountains are referenced by the name Monti Laziali, the mountains of [[Lazio]], the ancient [[Latium]]. Invading armies from the south had the choice of crossing the marsh or taking the only other road to Rome, the [[Via Latina]], running along the eastern flanks of the Monti Laziali, risking entrapment. The marshes were turned into cultivatable land in the 1930s under [[Benito Mussolini]]. Canals and pumping stations were built to remove the brackish water from the land. These canals divided the land into personal tracts with new stone houses for colonists from north Italy. Mussolini also founded the five cities destroyed by the battle.\n\nWhen [[Lucian Truscott]]'s [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|3rd Division]] was first selected for the operation, he pointed out to Clark that the position was a death trap and there would be no survivors. Agreeing, Clark canceled the operation, but Prime Minister Churchill revived it. Apparently the two allies had different concepts: the Americans viewed such a landing as another distraction from Cassino, but if they could not break through at Cassino, the men at Anzio would be trapped. Churchill and the British high command envisioned an outflanking movement ending with the capture of Rome. [[Allied Forces Headquarters|Mediterranean Theatre]] commander General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], leaving to take command of [[Operation Overlord]], left the decision up to Churchill with a warning about German unpredictability.<ref>{{harvnb|Atkinson|2008|p=324}}</ref> \n\nThe final plan called for Lucas to lead the US [[VI Corps (United States)|VI Corps]] in a landing in the Anzio area, followed by an advance into the [[Alban Hills]], to cut German communications and \"threaten the rear of the German XIV [[Panzer Corps]]\"{{cn|date=October 2019}} (under [[Fridolin von Senger und Etterlin]]). It was hoped that such an advance would draw German forces away from the Monte Cassino area and facilitate an Allied breakthrough there.\n\n==Plan==\nPlanners argued that if Kesselring (in charge of German forces in Italy) pulled troops out of the [[Gustav Line]] to defend against the Allied assault, then Allied forces would be able to break through the line; if Kesselring didn't pull troops out of the Gustav Line, then Operation Shingle would threaten to capture Rome and cut off the German units defending the Gustav Line. Should Germany have adequate reinforcements available to defend both Rome and the Gustav Line, the Allies felt that the operation would nevertheless be useful in engaging forces which could otherwise be committed on another front. The operation was officially canceled on December 18, 1943. However, it was later reselected.\n\nClark did not feel he had the numbers on the southern front to exploit any breakthrough. His plan therefore was relying on the southern offensive drawing Kesselring's reserves in and providing the Anzio force the opportunity to break inland quickly. This would also reflect the orders he had received from Alexander to \"...{{nbsp}}carry out an assault landing on the beaches in the vicinity of Rome with the object of cutting the enemy lines of communication and threatening the rear of the German XIV&nbsp;Corps [on the Gustav Line].\"<ref name=\"LC69\">{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=69}}</ref> However, his written orders to Lucas did not really reflect this. Initially Lucas had received orders to \"1. Seize and secure a [[beachhead]] in the vicinity of Anzio 2. Advance and secure Colli Laziali [the Alban Hills] 3. Be prepared to advance on Rome\".<ref name=\"LC69\"/> However, Clark's final orders stated \"...{{nbsp}}2. Advance on Colli Laziali\"<ref name=\"LC77\"/> giving Lucas considerable flexibility as to the timing of any advance on the Alban Hills. It is likely that the caution displayed by both Clark and Lucas was to some extent a product of Clark's experiences at the tough battle for the Salerno beach head<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=85}}</ref> and Lucas' natural caution stemming from his lack of experience in battle.\n\nNeither Clark nor Lucas had full confidence in either their superiors or the operational plan.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|pp=70\u201371}}</ref> Along with most of the Fifth Army staff they felt that ''Shingle'' was properly a two corps or even a full army task.<ref name=\"LC76\">{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=76}}</ref> A few days prior to the attack, Lucas wrote in his diary, \"They will end up putting me ashore with inadequate forces and get me in a serious jam... Then, who will get the blame?\"<ref name=\"LC77\">{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=77}}</ref> and \"[The operation] has a strong odour of [[Battle of Gallipoli|Gallipoli]] and apparently the same amateur was still on the coach's bench.\"<ref name=\"LC76\"/> The \"amateur\" can only have referred to Winston Churchill, architect of the disastrous Gallipoli landings of World War I and personal advocate of ''Shingle''.\n\n===Availability of naval forces===\nOne of the problems with the plan was the availability of [[landing ship]]s. The American commanders in particular were determined that nothing should delay the Normandy invasion and the supporting [[Operation Dragoon|landings in southern France]]. Operation Shingle would require the use of landing ships necessary for these operations. Initially ''Shingle'' was to release these assets by January&nbsp;15. However, this being deemed problematic, President Roosevelt granted permission for the craft to remain until February&nbsp;5.\n\nOnly enough [[Landing Ship, Tank|tank landing ships]] (LSTs) to land a single division were initially available to ''Shingle''. Later, at Churchill's personal insistence, enough were made available to land two divisions. Allied intelligence thought that five or six German divisions were in the area, although U.S. 5th Army intelligence severely underestimated the German 10th Army's fighting capacity at the time, believing many of their units would be worn out after the defensive battles fought since September.\n\n===Order of battle===\n{{Further|Anzio order of battle}}\n\n'''Task Force 81''' \n{{multiple image\n | direction = horizontal\n | width     = 140\n | header    = Allied naval commanders for Operation Shingle\n | image1    = Frank_J._Lowry.jpg\n | caption1  = Rear Adm.

However, these plans were scrapped on 20 January, apparently because of the high losses during the airborne assaults at Sicily. The 504th PIR was then assigned to land by sea.</ref>\n\n=== Southern attack ===\n{{Main|Battle of Monte Cassino}}\nThe Fifth Army's attack on the Gustav Line began on January 16, 1944, at [[Battle of Monte Cassino|Monte Cassino]]. The operation failed to break through, but it partly succeeded in its primary objective. Heinrich von Vietinghoff, commanding the Gustav Line, called for reinforcements, and Kesselring transferred the [[29th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|29th]] and [[90th Light Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|90th Panzergrenadier Divisions]] from Rome.\n\n== Battle ==\n\n==={{anchor|Operation Shingle}} Initial landings===\n<!-- linked from redirect [[Operation Shingle]] -->\n[[Image:Cassino+Anzio1943JanFeb.jpg|thumb|Force dispositions at Anzio and Cassino January / February 1944]]\nThe landings began on January 22, 1944.\n\nAlthough resistance had been expected, as seen at [[Operation Avalanche (World War II)#Salerno landings|Salerno]] during 1943, the initial landings were essentially unopposed, with the exception of desultory ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' strafing runs.\n\nBy midnight, 36,000 soldiers and 3,200 vehicles had landed on the beaches. Thirteen Allied troops were killed, and 97&nbsp;wounded; about 200 Germans had been taken as [[POWs]].<ref>{{harvnb|Laurie|1994|p=9}}</ref> The 1st Division penetrated {{convert|2|miles|sigfig=1}} inland, the Rangers captured Anzio's port, the 509th PIB captured Nettuno, and the 3rd Division penetrated {{convert|3|miles|sigfig=1}} inland.\n\nIn the first days of operations, the command of the [[Italian resistance movement]] had a meeting with the Allied General Headquarters: it offered to guide the Allied Force through the [[Alban Hills]] territory, but the Allied Command refused the proposal.\n\n=== After the landings ===\nIt is clear that Lucas' superiors expected some kind of offensive action from him. The point of the landing was to turn the German defences on the Winter Line, taking advantage of their exposed rear and hopefully panicking them into retreating northwards past Rome. However, Lucas instead poured more men and material into his tiny bridgehead, and strengthened his defences.\n\nWinston Churchill was clearly displeased with this action. He said: \"I had hoped we were hurling a wildcat into the shore, but all we got was a stranded whale\".<ref>{{harvnb|Colville|2004|p=456}}</ref>\n\nLucas' decision remains a controversial one. Noted military historian [[John Keegan]] wrote, \"Had Lucas risked rushing at Rome the first day, his spearheads would probably have arrived, though they would have soon been crushed. Nevertheless he might have 'staked out claims well inland.'<ref>John Keegan, ''The Second World War', Penguin Books; Reprint edition 2005, {{ISBN|978-0143035732}}, p. 357</ref> \"However, Lucas did not have confidence in the strategic planning of the operation. Also, he could certainly argue that his interpretation of his orders from Clark was not an unreasonable one. With two divisions landed, and facing two or three times that many Germans, it would have been reasonable for Lucas to consider the beachhead insecure. But according to Keegan, Lucas's actions \"achieved the worst of both worlds, exposing his forces to risk without imposing any on the enemy.\"\n\n=== Response of Axis forces ===\n[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J16897, Italien, Nettuno, britische Kriegsgefangene, Verwundete.jpg|thumb|220px|British POWs near Nettuno]]\nKesselring was informed of the landings at 3 a.m. January 22. Although the landings came as a surprise, Kesselring had made contingency plans to deal with possible landings at all the likely locations. All the plans relied on his divisions each having previously organised a motorized rapid reaction unit (''Kampfgruppe'') which could move speedily to meet the threat and buy time for the rest of the defenses to get in place.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=83}}</ref> At 5 a.m. he initiated Operation \"Richard\" and ordered the ''Kampfgruppe'' of [[4th Parachute Division (Germany)|4th Parachute Division]] and the [[Fallschirm-Panzer Division 1 Hermann G\u00f6ring|Hermann G\u00f6ring Panzer Division]] to defend the roads leading from Anzio to the [[Alban Hills]] via [[Aprilia, Lazio|Campoleone]] and [[Battle of Cisterna|Cisterna]] whilst his plans expected some 20,000 defending troops to have arrived by the end of the first day. In addition, he requested that [[OKW]] send reinforcements, and in response to this they ordered the equivalent of more than three divisions from France, [[Yugoslavia]], and Germany whilst at the same time releasing to Kesselring a further three divisions in Italy which had been under OKW's direct command.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=101}}</ref> Later that morning, he ordered General [[Eberhard von Mackensen]] ([[14th Army (Wehrmacht)|Fourteenth Army]]) and General [[Heinrich von Vietinghoff]] ([[10th Army (Wehrmacht)|Tenth Army]] \u2013 Gustav Line) to send him additional reinforcements.\n\nThe German units in the immediate vicinity had in fact been dispatched to reinforce the Gustav Line only a few days earlier. All available reserves from the southern front or on their way to it were rushed toward Anzio and Nettuno; these included the [[3rd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|3rd Panzer Grenadier]] and [[71st Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|71st Infantry Divisions]], and the bulk of the Luftwaffe's Hermann G\u00f6ring Panzer Division. Kesselring initially considered that a successful defence could not be made if the Allies launched a major attack on January&nbsp;23 or January&nbsp;24. However, by the end of January&nbsp;22, the lack of aggressive action convinced him that a defence could be made. Nevertheless, few additional defenders arrived on January&nbsp;23, although the arrival on the evening of January&nbsp;22 of Lieutenant General [[Alfred Schlemm]] and his 1st&nbsp;Parachute Corps headquarters brought greater organisation and purpose to the German defensive preparations. By January&nbsp;24, however, the Germans had over 40,000 troops in prepared defensive positions.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=123}}</ref>\n\nThree days after the landings, the beachhead was surrounded by a defence line consisting of three divisions: The 4th Parachute Division to the west, the 3rd Panzer Grenadier Division to the center in front of Alban Hills, the Hermann G\u00f6ring Panzer Division to the east.\n\nVon Mackensen's 14th Army assumed overall control of the defence on January&nbsp;25. Elements of eight German divisions were employed in the defence line around the beachhead, and five more divisions were on their way to the Anzio area. Kesselring ordered an attack on the beachhead for January&nbsp;28, though it was postponed to February&nbsp;1.\n\n=== Liberty ship involvement===\n[[Liberty ship]]s, which were never intended as warships, were involved in some fighting during the battle of Anzio.

Due to faulty intelligence, when daylight arrived they were engaged and cut off. A brutal battle with elements of the [[Fallschirm-Panzer Division 1 Hermann G\u00f6ring|Hermann G\u00f6ring]] division followed.

Some hours after the attack started the coherence of the front line had been completely shattered, and the fighting for the salient had given way to small unit actions, swaying back and forth through the gullies. In the morning of February&nbsp;4 the situation was becoming more serious, with the 1st Battalion, [[Irish Guards]] (of [[24th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|24th Guards Brigade]]), only having one cohesive [[Company (military unit)|rifle company]] left and on the opposite side of the salient, the 6th Battalion, [[Gordon Highlanders]] (of [[2nd Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|2nd Brigade]]) was beginning to crumble and later lost three complete companies as [[Prisoner of war|prisoners]].<ref>D'Este, p. 200.</ref>\n\nEven though the base of the salient was nearly broken, Lucas was able to bolster the British 1st Division's defenses with the newly arrived [[168th (2nd London) Brigade|168th Brigade]] (from the 56th Division, containing 1st Battalion, [[London Irish Rifles]], 1st Battalion, [[London Scottish (regiment)|London Scottish]], 10th Battalion, [[Royal Berkshire Regiment]]).<ref name=\"LLoyd162\">{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=162}}</ref> The [[3rd Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|3rd Brigade]] had been tasked with holding the tip of the salient 2 miles long and 1,000 yards wide on the road going north of Campoleone, but after the German attacks in the early hours of 4 February, the 2nd Battalion, [[Sherwood Foresters]], 1st Battalion, [[King's Shropshire Light Infantry]] and 1st Battalion, [[Duke of Wellington's Regiment]] (all of 3rd Brigade) had been cut off and were surrounded in the pocket.

In anticipation of the following spring, Kesselring ordered the preparation of a new defence line, the [[Caesar C line]], behind the line of beachhead running from the mouth of the river [[Tiber]] just south of Rome through [[Albano Laziale|Albano]], skirting south of the Alban Hills to [[Valmontone]] and across Italy to the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coast at [[Pescara]], behind which 14th Army and, to their left, 10th Army might withdraw when the need arose.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|pp=219\u2013220}}</ref> Meanwhile, [[Lucian Truscott]], who had been promoted from the command of U.S. 3rd&nbsp;Infantry Division to replace Lucas as commander of VI&nbsp;Corps on February&nbsp;22, worked with his staff on the plans for a decisive attack as part of a general offensive which Alexander was planning for May and which would include a major offensive on the Gustav Line, [[Operation Diadem]]. The objective of the plan was to fully engage Kesselring's armies with a major offensive and remove any prospect of the Germans withdrawing forces from Italy to redeploy elsewhere. It was also intended to trap the bulk of the German 10th Army between the Allied forces advancing through the Gustav Line and VI&nbsp;Corps thrusting inland from Anzio.\n\nIn March, the 2nd Italian SS \"Vendetta\" Battalion and 29th Italian SS Rifle Battalion were sent to fight against the Anglo-American forces at the Anzio beachhead. Dispersed among German battalions, the German commanding officers later gave the Italians companies favourable reports. Members of former Blackshirt Lieutenant-Colonel Degli Oddi's \"Vendetta\" helped defeat a determined effort by the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division to overrun their positions and captured a number of prisoners.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Their  performance at Anzio led to designation as units of the Waffen-SS, with all the duties and rights that that entailed.<ref>{{harvnb|Williamson|Stephen|2004|pp=18\u201319}}</ref>\n\nThe next few weeks saw many changes in divisions on both sides. The [[504th Infantry Regiment (United States)|U.S. 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment]], which had fought with distinction but suffered heavy losses, was withdrawn to England on 23 March 1944. Also in March the [[34th Infantry Division (United States)|U.S. 34th Infantry Division]] and in early May, [[36th Infantry Division (United States)|U.S. 36th Infantry Division]], had arrived at Anzio. On the British side the [[24th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|24th Guards Brigade]] of [[1st Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|British 1st Infantry Division]] was replaced in the first week of March by [[18th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|18th Infantry Brigade]] (from [[1st (United Kingdom) Division|British 1st Armoured Division]] in North Africa). The Guards Brigade had suffered devastating casualties (nearly 2,000 of an initial strength of over 2,500) in just less than two months at Anzio.<ref name=\"Blaxland, p. 48\"/> In late March the [[56th (London) Division|56th (London) Infantry Division]] had also been relieved, after sustaining very heavy losses (one of its battalions \u2014 7th [[Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry|Ox and Bucks]] of [[167th (1st London) Brigade|167th (London) Brigade]] \u2014 had been reduced from 1,000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/stories/33/a3603133.shtml|title=BBC \u2013 WW2 People's War \u2013 Oxs and Bucks at Anzio|website=www.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=5 September 2017}}</ref> to 60), by [[5th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|British 5th Infantry Division]]. By late May, there were some 150,000 Allied troops in the bridgehead,<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=281}}</ref> including five U.S. and two British divisions, facing five German divisions. The Germans were well dug into prepared defenses, but were weak in numbers of officers and NCOs and, by the time of the late May offensive, lacked any reserves (which had all been sent south to the Gustav fighting).<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=271}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:AnzioCassino1944May.jpg|thumb|The Allied breakout from Anzio and advance from the Gustav Line May 1944.]]\n\nDespite Alexander's overall plan for ''Diadem'' requiring VI Corps to strike inland and cut Route&nbsp;6, Clark asked Truscott to prepare alternatives and to be ready to switch from one to another at 48&nbsp;hours' notice. Of the four scenarios prepared by Truscott, Operation Buffalo called for an attack through Cisterna, into the gap in the hills and to cut Route&nbsp;6 at Valmontone. Operation Turtle on the other hand foresaw a main thrust to the left of the Alban Hills taking Campoleone, Albano and on to Rome. On May&nbsp;5, Alexander selected ''Buffalo'' and issued Clark with orders to this effect.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|pp=271\u2013272}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Clark was determined that VI Corps should strike directly for Rome as evidenced in his later writing: \"We not only wanted the honor of capturing Rome, but felt that we deserved it... Not only did we intend to become the first army to seize Rome from the south, but we intended to see that people at home knew that it was the Fifth Army that did the job, and knew the price that had been paid for it.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=272}}</ref> He argued to Alexander that VI&nbsp;Corps did not have the strength to trap the German 10th Army and Alexander, instead of making his requirements clear, was conciliatory and gave the impression that a push on Rome was still a possibility if ''Buffalo'' ran into difficulties.<ref name=\"LC273\">{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=273}}</ref> On May&nbsp;6, Clark informed Truscott that \"..the capture of Rome is the only important objective and to be ready to execute ''Turtle'' as well as ''Buffalo''\".<ref name=\"LC273\"/>\n\nTruscott's planning for ''Buffalo'' was meticulous: British 5th Division and 1st Division on the left were to attack along the coast and up the Via Anziate to pin the German 4th Parachute, 65th Infantry and 3rd Panzergrenadier in place whilst the U.S. 45th Infantry, 1st Armored and 3rd Infantry Divisions would launch the main assault, engaging the German 362nd and 715th Infantry Divisions and striking towards Campoleone, [[Velletri]] and Cisterna respectively.

By the end of May&nbsp;25, 3rd&nbsp;Infantry were heading into the Velletri gap near [[Cori, Lazio|Cori]], and elements of 1st Armored had reached within {{convert|3|mi}} of Valmontone and were in contact with units of the Herman G\u00f6ring Division which were just starting to arrive from Leghorn.<ref name=\"Leghorn\" group=nb/> Although VI&nbsp;Corps had suffered over 3,300 casualties in the three days fighting, Operation Buffalo was going to plan, and Truscott was confident that a concerted attack by 1st&nbsp;Armored and 3rd&nbsp;Infantry Divisions the next day would get his troops astride Route&nbsp;6.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=300}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Anzio1944May-June.jpg|thumb|The final move on Rome]]\nOn the evening of May 25, Truscott received new orders from Clark via his Operations Officer, Brigadier General Don Brand. These were, in effect, to implement Operation Turtle and turn the main line of attack 90 degrees to the left. Most importantly, although the attack towards Valmontone and Route&nbsp;6 would continue, 1st&nbsp;Armored were to withdraw to prepare to exploit the planned breakthrough along the new line of attack leaving 3rd&nbsp;Division to continue towards [[Valmontone]] with 1st Special Service Force in support.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=301}}</ref> Clark informed Alexander of these developments late in the morning of May&nbsp;26 by which time the change of orders was a ''fait accompli''.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=302}}</ref>\n\nAt the time, Truscott was shocked, writing later\n\n<blockquote>...I was dumbfounded. This was no time to drive to the north-west where the enemy was still strong; we should pour our maximum power into the Valmontone Gap to insure the destruction of the retreating German Army. I would not comply with the order without first talking to General Clark in person. ... [However] he was not on the beachhead and could not be reached even by radio... such was the order that turned the main effort of the beachhead forces from the Valmontone Gap and prevented destruction of the German Tenth Army. On the 26th the order was put into effect.<ref>{{harvnb|Majdalany|1957|p= 256}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHe went on to write\n\n<blockquote>There has never been any doubt in my mind that had General Clark held loyally to General Alexander's instructions, had he not changed the direction of my attack to the north-west on May&nbsp;26, the strategic objectives of Anzio would have been accomplished in full. To be first in Rome was a poor compensation for this lost opportunity.<ref>{{harvnb|Majdalany|1957| p=259}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nOn May 26, while the VI Corps was initiating its difficult maneuver, Kesselring threw elements of four divisions into the Velletri gap to stall the advance on Route&nbsp;6. For four days they slugged it out against 3rd Division until finally withdrawing on May&nbsp;30, having kept Route&nbsp;6 open and allowed seven divisions from 10th&nbsp;Army to withdraw and head north of Rome.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=304}}</ref>\n\nOn the new axis of attack little progress was made until 1st Armored were in position on May&nbsp;29, when the front advanced to the main Caesar C Line defences. Nevertheless, an early breakthrough seemed unlikely until on May&nbsp;30 Major General [[Fred L. Walker]]'s [[36th Infantry Division (United States)|36th Division]] found a gap in the Caesar Line at the join between 1st&nbsp;Parachute Corps and LXXVI&nbsp;Panzer Corps. Climbing the steep slopes of Monte Artemisio they threatened Velletri from the rear and obliged the defenders to withdraw. This was a key turning point, and von&nbsp;Mackensen offered his resignation which Kesselring accepted.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=307}}</ref>\n\nRaising the pressure further, Clark assigned [[II Corps (United States)|U.S. II Corps]] which, fighting its way along the coast from the Gustav Line, had joined up with VI&nbsp;Corps on May&nbsp;25 to attack around the right hand side of the Alban Hills and advance along the line of Route&nbsp;6 to Rome.\n\nOn June 2 the Caesar Line collapsed under the mounting pressure, and 14th Army commenced a fighting withdrawal through Rome. On the same day Hitler, fearing another Stalingrad, had ordered Kesslering that there should be \"no defence of Rome\".<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=311}}</ref> Over the next day, the rearguards were gradually overwhelmed, and Rome was entered in the early hours of June&nbsp;4 with Clark holding an impromptu press conference on the steps of the Town Hall on the [[Capitoline Hill]] that morning. He ensured the event was a strictly American affair by stationing military police at road junctions to refuse entry to the city by British military personnel.<ref>{{harvnb|Clark|2006|pp=309\u2013319}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:The British Army in Italy 1944 NA11058.jpg|thumb|British soldier guards a group of German prisoners at Anzio, 22 January 1944]]\nAlthough controversy continues regarding what might have happened if Lucas had been more aggressive from the start, most commentators agree that the initial plan for Anzio was flawed. They question whether the initial landing of just over two infantry divisions, with no supporting armour, had the strength to achieve the objectives: of cutting Route 6 and then holding off the inevitable counterattacks that would come, as Kesselring redeployed his forces.\n\nVolume 5 of Churchill's ''The Second World War'' is riddled with implied criticism of Lucas blaming the failure on his caution. After the war, Kesselring gave his evaluation:\n\n{{quote|It would have been the Anglo-American doom to overextend themselves. The landing force was initially weak, only a division or so of infantry, and without armour. It was a halfway measure of an offensive; that was your basic error.<ref Name=\"Lloyd325\">{{harvnb|Clark|2006|p=325}}</ref>}}\n\nFurthermore, Field Marshal Sir [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|Harold Alexander]], in his Official Dispatch, stated, \"The actual course of events was probably the most advantageous in the end.\"<ref Name=\"Lloyd325\"/>\n\nChurchill defended the operation<ref>{{harvnb|Churchill|1985|p=436}}</ref> and believed that sufficient forces were available. He had clearly made great political efforts to procure certain resources, especially the extra [[Landing Ship, Tank|LSTs]] needed to deliver a second division to shore, but also specific units useful to the attack such as with the [[504th Infantry Regiment (United States)|504th Parachute Infantry Regiment]]. He argued that even regardless of the tactical outcome of the operation, there was immediate strategic benefit with regard to the wider war. After the landings, the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|German High Command]] dropped its plans to transfer five of Kesselring's best divisions to [[Western Front (World War II)|Northwestern Europe]]. That obviously benefited the upcoming [[Operation Overlord]]. Churchill also had to ensure the British-dominated forces in Italy were contributing to the war at a time when the Soviet [[Red Army]] were suffering tremendous losses on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].\n\nBecause of Clark's change of plan, [[Operation Diadem]] (during which the [[United States Army North|U.S. Fifth Army]] and the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]] sustained 44,000 casualties) failed in its objective of destroying the [[10th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 10th Army]]. It also condemned the Allies to another year of bloody combat in Italy, notably around the [[Gothic Line]] from August 1944 through March 1945.\n\nThe greatest loss was that if the [[VI Corps (United States)|U.S. Army VI Corps]] main effort had continued on the [[Valmontone]] axis from May 26, Clark could probably have reached Rome more quickly than by the route northwest from Cisterna. The VI Corps could also have cut Highway 6 and then put much more pressure on the 10th Army than it actually did.<ref>{{harvnb|Mathews|2000|p=363}}</ref>\n\n[[Alan Whicker]] who as a war correspondent with the British Army's Film and Photo Unit, and who was present during the fighting, later said:\n\n{{quote|After breaking out of Anzio, Alexander's plan was for the Fifth Army to drive east to cut Kesselring's escape route to the north and trap much of his Tenth and Fourteenth Armies. The operation started well, but then suddenly, when leading troops were only six kilometers from closing their trap at [[Frosinone]], the Fifth Army was re-directed and sent north towards Rome. The trap was left open. General Mark Clark was so eager that the world should see pictures showing him as the liberator of Rome, that he allowed the armies of a delighted Kesselring to escape.\n\nHe had ignored the orders of Field Marshall Alexander in a decision as militarily stupid as it was insubordinate.\n\nThis, vain-glorious blunder, the worst of the entire war, lost us a stunning victory, lengthened the war by many months and earned Mark Clark the contempt of other American and British generals. They saw an operation that could have won the war in Italy, thrown away at the cost of many Allied lives, because of the obsession and vanity of one man.\n\nIf General Mark Clark had been in the German Army, Hitler would have had him shot.|Alan Whicker <ref>''Whicker's War'' Part Two \"The Survivor\", Insight Television, 2004.</ref>}}\n\n==Notable participants==\n* [[Brigadier General (Lieutenant colonel at the time) Felix L.

In this context, energy use includes energy from fossil, nuclear, hydroelectric, biomass, geothermal, technological solar, and wind sources. (It excludes solar energy captured by photosynthesis, used in hay drying, etc.) The estimated energy use in agricultural production includes embodied energy in purchased inputs.<ref>Canning, P., A. Charles, S. Huang, K. R. Polenske, and A Waters. 2010. Energy use in the U.S. food system. USDA Economic Research Service, ERR-94. 33 pp.</ref>\n\nAn important aspect of energy use of livestock production is the energy consumption that the animals contribute. Feed Conversion Ratio is an animal's ability to covert feed into meat. The Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR) is calculated by the taking the energy, protein or mass input of the feed divided by the output of meat provided by the animal. A lower FCR corresponds with a smaller requirement of feed per meat out-put, therefore the animal contributes less GHG emissions. Chickens and pigs usually have a lower FCR compared to ruminants.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=R\u00f6\u00f6s|first=Elin|last2=Sundberg|first2=Cecilia|last3=Tid\u00e5ker|first3=Pernilla|last4=Strid|first4=Ingrid|last5=Hansson|first5=Per-Anders|date=2013-01-01|title=Can carbon footprint serve as an indicator of the environmental impact of meat production? |journal=Ecological Indicators|volume=24|pages=573\u2013581|doi=10.1016/j.ecolind.2012.08.004}}</ref>\n\nIntensification and other changes in the livestock industries influence energy use, emissions and other environmental effects of meat production. For example, in the US beef production system, practices prevailing in 2007 are estimated to have involved 8.6 percent less fossil fuel use, 16 percent less greenhouse gas emissions, 12 percent less water use and 33 percent less land use, per unit mass of beef produced, than in 1977.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Capper | first1 = J.

National Enforcement Initiative: Preventing animal waste from contaminating surface and ground water. http://www2.epa.gov/enforcement/national-enforcement-initiative-preventing-animal-waste-contaminating-surface-and-ground#progress</ref> Environmental performance of the US livestock industry can be compared with several other industries. The EPA has published 5-year and 1-year data for 32 industries on their ratios of enforcement orders to inspections, a measure of non-compliance with environmental regulations: principally, those under Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act. For the livestock industry, inspections focused primarily on CAFOs. Of the 31 other industries, 4 (including crop production) had a better 5-year environmental record than the livestock industry, 2 had a similar record, and 25 had a worse record in this respect. For the most recent year of the five-year compilation, livestock production and dry cleaning had the best environmental records of the 32 industries, each with an enforcement order/inspection ratio of 0.01. For crop production, the ratio was 0.02. Of the 32 industries, oil and gas extraction and the livestock industry had the lowest percentages of facilities with violations.<ref>US EPA. 2000.

Manure deposited on pastures by grazing animals themselves is applied efficiently for maintaining soil fertility. Animal manures are also commonly collected from barns and concentrated feeding areas for efficient re-use of many nutrients in crop production, sometimes after composting. For many areas with high livestock density, manure application substantially replaces application of synthetic fertilizers on surrounding cropland. Manure was spread as a fertilizer on about 15.8 million acres of US cropland in 2006.<ref>McDonald, J. M. et al. 2009. Manure use for fertilizer and for energy. Report to Congress. USDA, AP-037. 53pp.</ref> Manure is also spread on forage-producing land that is grazed, rather than cropped. Altogether, in 2007, manure was applied on about 22.1 million acres in the United States.<ref name=USDA2009/> Substitution of animal manure for synthetic fertilizer has important implications for energy use and greenhouse gas emissions, considering that between about 43 and 88 MJ (i.e. between about 10 and 21 Mcal) of fossil fuel energy are used per kg of N in the production of synthetic nitrogenous fertilizers.<ref>Shapouri, H. et al. 2002. The energy balance of corn ethanol: an update.

In this context, energy use includes energy from fossil, nuclear, hydroelectric, biomass, geothermal, technological solar, and wind sources. (It excludes solar energy captured by photosynthesis, used in hay drying, etc.) The estimated energy use in agricultural production includes embodied energy in purchased inputs.<ref>Canning, P., A. Charles, S. Huang, K. R. Polenske, and A Waters. 2010. Energy use in the U.S. food system. USDA Economic Research Service, ERR-94. 33 pp.</ref>\n\nAn important aspect of energy use of livestock production is the energy consumption that the animals contribute. Feed Conversion Ratio is an animal's ability to covert feed into meat. The Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR) is calculated by the taking the energy, protein or mass input of the feed divided by the output of meat provided by the animal. A lower FCR corresponds with a smaller requirement of feed per meat out-put, therefore the animal contributes less GHG emissions. Chickens and pigs usually have a lower FCR compared to ruminants.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=R\u00f6\u00f6s|first=Elin|last2=Sundberg|first2=Cecilia|last3=Tid\u00e5ker|first3=Pernilla|last4=Strid|first4=Ingrid|last5=Hansson|first5=Per-Anders|date=2013-01-01|title=Can carbon footprint serve as an indicator of the environmental impact of meat production? |journal=Ecological Indicators|volume=24|pages=573\u2013581|doi=10.1016/j.ecolind.2012.08.004}}</ref>\n\nIntensification and other changes in the livestock industries influence energy use, emissions and other environmental effects of meat production. For example, in the US beef production system, practices prevailing in 2007 are estimated to have involved 8.6 percent less fossil fuel use, 16 percent less greenhouse gas emissions, 12 percent less water use and 33 percent less land use, per unit mass of beef produced, than in 1977.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Capper | first1 = J.

The EPA has published 5-year and 1-year data for 32 industries on their ratios of enforcement orders to inspections, a measure of non-compliance with environmental regulations: principally, those under Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act. For the livestock industry, inspections focused primarily on CAFOs. Of the 31 other industries, 4 (including crop production) had a better 5-year environmental record than the livestock industry, 2 had a similar record, and 25 had a worse record in this respect. For the most recent year of the five-year compilation, livestock production and dry cleaning had the best environmental records of the 32 industries, each with an enforcement order/inspection ratio of 0.01. For crop production, the ratio was 0.02. Of the 32 industries, oil and gas extraction and the livestock industry had the lowest percentages of facilities with violations.<ref>US EPA. 2000.

Manure deposited on pastures by grazing animals themselves is applied efficiently for maintaining soil fertility. Animal manures are also commonly collected from barns and concentrated feeding areas for efficient re-use of many nutrients in crop production, sometimes after composting. For many areas with high livestock density, manure application substantially replaces application of synthetic fertilizers on surrounding cropland. Manure was spread as a fertilizer on about 15.8 million acres of US cropland in 2006.<ref>McDonald, J. M. et al. 2009. Manure use for fertilizer and for energy. Report to Congress. USDA, AP-037. 53pp.</ref> Manure is also spread on forage-producing land that is grazed, rather than cropped. Altogether, in 2007, manure was applied on about 22.1 million acres in the United States.<ref name=USDA2009/> Substitution of animal manure for synthetic fertilizer has important implications for energy use and greenhouse gas emissions, considering that between about 43 and 88 MJ (i.e. between about 10 and 21 Mcal) of fossil fuel energy are used per kg of N in the production of synthetic nitrogenous fertilizers.<ref>Shapouri, H. et al. 2002.
