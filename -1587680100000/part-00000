{"title_page": "Midphalangeal hair", "text_new": "{{Orphan|date=February 2015}}\n\n'''Midphalangeal hair''', or the presence/absence of hair on the middle [[phalanx bone|phalanx]] of the [[ring finger]], is one of the most widely studied markers in classical genetics of human populations. Although this [[Chromosomal polymorphism|polymorphism]] was observed at other fingers as well, for this kind of research, the fourth finger of the hand has been conventionally selected.\n\n==Description==\nIn humans, [[hair]] is commonly present on all the basal segments of the [[digit (anatomy)|digits]] and invariably absent from all the terminal ones. On the middle segments, there is wide fluctuation with apparent familial and [[race (human classification)|racial]] tendencies. Hair is present on the middle segment of the fingers more frequently than on the middle segment of the toes. Hair is most often found on the middle segment of the fourth [[finger]].\n\n==History==\nWillier (1974),<ref>Willier B. H.(1974): Charles Haskell Danforth. Biogr. Mem. Natl. Acad. Sci., 44: 1-56. {{PMID|11615640}}</ref> related citations quoted Danforth as stating that 'the hair [[follicle (anatomy)|follicle]] is a kind of [[biology|biological]] microcosm in which almost any problem relating to growth, differentiation, decline and rejuvenescence of [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] can be studied to advantage....' While riding on a streetcar in Wilkes-Barre one summer, Danforth observed, in his own words, that 'a man in front of me draped his arm over the back of the seat and I noticed that while his [[arm]] was very hairy the middle segments of his fingers were free of hair and so, I observed, were my own; but I knew this was not generally true.' So far as he was aware, no one before had recognized this variation as possibly [[hereditary]].\n\n==Inheritance ==\nThe [[genetics|genetic]] determination of presence or absence of hair on the dorsal aspect of the middle phalanx was first suggested by Danforth (1921). From a study of 80 families with a total of 178 children, he suggested that 'a [[phylogenetics|phylogenetically]] progressive loss of hair is brought about through the action of one or more [[recessive gene]]s, or of one primary recessive gene with several modifying factors that regulate the distribution of hair when it is present.' Stated conversely, 'despite the fact that in evolutionary progress hair is disappearing from the mid-digital region, its presence...may be regarded as the manifestation of a dominant trait.'\n\nBernstein and Burks (1942) <ref>Beckman L., Book  J.  A. (1959): Distribution and inheritance of mid-digital hair in Sweden.

Although this [[Chromosomal polymorphism|polymorphism]] was observed at other fingers as well, for this kind of research, the fourth finger of the hand has been conventionally selected.\n\n==Description==\nIn humans, [[hair]] is commonly present on all the basal segments of the [[digit (anatomy)|digits]] and invariably absent from all the terminal ones. On the middle segments, there is wide fluctuation with apparent familial and [[race (human classification)|racial]] tendencies. Hair is present on the middle segment of the fingers more frequently than on the middle segment of the toes. Hair is most often found on the middle segment of the fourth [[finger]].\n\n==History==\nWillier (1974),<ref>Willier B. H.(1974): Charles Haskell Danforth. Biogr. Mem. Natl. Acad. Sci., 44: 1-56. {{PMID|11615640}}</ref> related citations quoted Danforth as stating that 'the hair [[follicle (anatomy)|follicle]] is a kind of [[biology|biological]] microcosm in which almost any problem relating to growth, differentiation, decline and rejuvenescence of [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] can be studied to advantage....' While riding on a streetcar in Wilkes-Barre one summer, Danforth observed, in his own words, that 'a man in front of me draped his arm over the back of the seat and I noticed that while his [[arm]] was very hairy the middle segments of his fingers were free of hair and so, I observed, were my own; but I knew this was not generally true.' So far as he was aware, no one before had recognized this variation as possibly [[hereditary]].\n\n==Inheritance ==\nThe [[genetics|genetic]] determination of presence or absence of hair on the dorsal aspect of the middle phalanx was first suggested by Danforth (1921). From a study of 80 families with a total of 178 children, he suggested that 'a [[phylogenetics|phylogenetically]] progressive loss of hair is brought about through the action of one or more [[recessive gene]]s, or of one primary recessive gene with several modifying factors that regulate the distribution of hair when it is present.' Stated conversely, 'despite the fact that in evolutionary progress hair is disappearing from the mid-digital region, its presence...may be regarded as the manifestation of a dominant trait.'\n\nBernstein and Burks (1942) <ref>Beckman L., Book  J.  A. (1959): Distribution and inheritance of mid-digital hair in Sweden. Hereditas 45: 215-220.</ref>\nsuggested that 5 [[allele|allelic]] genes, A-0 to A-4, 'control the inheritance and distribution of middigital hair involving but a [[single gene]] substitution (the subscript denoting the number of fingers affected with middigital hair),' and that the genes for the presence of hair are [[dominance (genetics)|dominant]] over the genes for its absence.<ref>Bernstein  M.

{"title_page": "Golovnin Incident", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2017}}\n[[File:Vasily Golovnin taken prisoner.JPG|500px|thumb|Vasily Golovnin taken prisoner]]\nThe '''Golovnin Incident''' involved the capture of [[Russia]]n explorer and naval captain, [[Vasily Golovnin]] in 1811, by soldiers of the Japanese [[Tokugawa shogunate|shogunate]] in accordance of Japan's policy of isolationism ([[Sakoku]]). Golovnin was interned in [[Japan]] for two years before being released in 1813. The incident was an important flashpoint in [[Empire of Japan\u2013Russian Empire relations|Russo-Japanese relations]] over the control of the [[Kuril islands]]. Golovnin's book ''Memoirs of a Captivity in Japan during the Years 1811, 1812 and 1813 with observations on the country and the people'', recounted his captivity, was a popular work in Europe and was translated into several languages.\n\n== Original Mission ==\nIn April 1811, the Russian minister of the Marine directed the [[Sloop-of-war|sloop]] ''Diana'' to explore the Southern [[Kuril]] and [[Shantar Islands]] as well as the [[Tartary|Tartary Coast]]. Golovnin had originally been dispatched from [[Kronstadt]] to the North-West [[Pacific]] in 1807 to chart the eastern coast of the [[Russian Empire]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Golovnin|first=Vasily|title=Memoirs of a Captivity in Japan during the Years 1811, 1812 and 1813 with observations on the country and the people Volume 1|year=1824|publisher=Henry Colburn & Co|pages=1}}</ref>\n[[File:The sloop Diana during Vasily Golovnins journey.JPG|thumb|Japanese illustration of the sloop ''Diana'']]\n\nIn the 18th century Russian [[fur trappers]] had moved through [[Siberia]] towards the North-West Pacific and some had even settled in the Kurils.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lensen|first=George|title=Early Russo-Japanese Relations|journal=The Far East Quarterly|year=1950|volume=10|issue=1}}</ref> Prior attempts to map the islands had proved difficult due to the mists that rose from the islands as well as strong winds. The expedition would sail in the summer when conditions would be optimal and then Golovnin would continue to the Shantar Islands. The ''Diana'' left [[Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky]] on 25 April through the ice-flows and set to sea from [[Avacha Bay]] on 4 May. Golovnin was conscientious of respecting relations between Russia and Japan as his voyage followed several diplomatic incidents with Japan such as the castaway incident of [[Daikokuya K\u014dday\u016b]] in 1784, the [[Adam Laxman]] incident of 1791 and [[Nikolai Rezanov|Nikolai Rezanov's]] failed trade mission in 1805. Rezanov who then visited the [[United States]] was brought back to Siberia by Lieutenant Chwostoff in vessels belonging to the [[Russian-American Company]] but died when he reached Siberia in 1807. Chwostoff, however, proceeded to raid Japanese villages in [[Sakhalin]] and the Kurils without [[Tsardom of Russia|government]] authority.<ref>Golovnin. pp. 6-19.</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Wildes|first=Harry|title=Russia\u2019s attempts to open Japan|journal=Russian Review|volume=5|issue=1|page=76|doi=10.2307/125540}}</ref>\nThe ''Diana'' sailed to the island of [[Iturup|Eetooroop]] and made contact with a group of [[Ainu people|Ainu]] (or Kuriles) who had been sent by the Japanese to investigate the Europeans. Golovnin proceeded to meet the Japanese military commander of the island, declaring his intention to collect wood and water and then be on his way. The commander stated that they couldn't trust the Russians due to the actions of Chwostoff, he agreed to send a letter to other commanders granting them access to supplies at the town of 'Oorbeetsch'.<ref>Golovnin. pp. 20-27</ref> The Russians set sail, but were then intercepted by a [[Umiak|baidara]] with the Kuriles on board, as well as a newcomer; Alexei Maximovitsch. Alexei joined the Russians as an interpreter, though his proficiency in Russian was low. Many of these Kuriles came from Russian-controlled islands and had been punished for Chwostoff's attack on Japanese settlements, thus feared and resented the Japanese.<ref>Golovnin. pp. 28-37</ref> Moreover, the Japanese had brutally crushed an Ainu [[Menashi-Kunashir Rebellion|rebellion]] in 1789.<ref>{{cite book|last=Walker|first=Brett|title=The Conquest of Ainu Lands: Ecology and Culture in Japanese Expansion 1590-1800|year=2001|publisher=University of California Press|pages=172\u201376}}</ref>\n\n== Capture ==\n\nEuropean explorers had not yet discovered [[Nemuro Strait]] between [[Hokkaido]] (Matsmai) and [[Kunashir]], prompting Golovnin to explore them on 4 July. As the ''Diana'' approached the harbour at Kunashir, it was fired upon by the Japanese castle. After several attempts, the ''Diana'' made contact with Japanese officers on the island. They offered the necessary supplies as well as a meeting with the island's [[Bugy\u014d]] or governor. So as to clear the Russian government of responsibility from the Chwostoff raids, Golovnin, two officers, four sailors and the Kurile Alexei landed. There they were met by the governor of Kunashir in his castle. Negotiations seemed amicable, but the Japanese had lured Golovnin onto the island and arrested him and the other crew members.<ref>Golovnin. pp. 48-75</ref> \n\nThe crew was tightly bound with ropes whilst the ''Diana'', now under control of Petr Rikord, shot at the castle but was then forced to set sail to avoid capture.<ref>Golovnin. pp. 76-79</ref> The captives were sailed across the straits to Hokkaido and encountered many villagers who were curious to see the Russians, due to the almost complete absence of foreigners in Japan. A Japanese drawing of their captivity shows the Russians' tall stature compared to the Japanese, which is also confirmed by Golovnin. The crew was led to a prison in [[Hakodate]], the capital of Hokkaido.\n\n== Captivity ==\n\nThe crew were kept in separate cells in a well guarded wooden prison. During the imprisonment, the Japanese began interrogating the officers with many precise questions, revealing the lack of knowledge that both cultures had for the other. On 25 August, the commander brought Golovnin his personal wares from his cabin on the Diana, much to his surprise, but the ''Diana'' had not been captured but had simply sent these items ashore. He was later brought before the governor of Hokkaido and made to discuss the events that took place by Resanov and Chwostoff. The governor handed him a letter from the remaining officers of the ''Diana'' who explained why they were not able to save them in the Kurils and that they would work towards their release. Golovnin was also provided with another letter written in 1806 by Chwostoff, stating that he had annexed the island of [[Sakhalin]] in the name of the [[Tsar]].

Golovnin was interned in [[Japan]] for two years before being released in 1813. The incident was an important flashpoint in [[Empire of Japan\u2013Russian Empire relations|Russo-Japanese relations]] over the control of the [[Kuril islands]]. Golovnin's book ''Memoirs of a Captivity in Japan during the Years 1811, 1812 and 1813 with observations on the country and the people'', recounted his captivity, was a popular work in Europe and was translated into several languages.\n\n== Original Mission ==\nIn April 1811, the Russian minister of the Marine directed the [[Sloop-of-war|sloop]] ''Diana'' to explore the Southern [[Kuril]] and [[Shantar Islands]] as well as the [[Tartary|Tartary Coast]]. Golovnin had originally been dispatched from [[Kronstadt]] to the North-West [[Pacific]] in 1807 to chart the eastern coast of the [[Russian Empire]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Golovnin|first=Vasily|title=Memoirs of a Captivity in Japan during the Years 1811, 1812 and 1813 with observations on the country and the people Volume 1|year=1824|publisher=Henry Colburn & Co|pages=1}}</ref>\n[[File:The sloop Diana during Vasily Golovnins journey.JPG|thumb|Japanese illustration of the sloop ''Diana'']]\n\nIn the 18th century Russian [[fur trappers]] had moved through [[Siberia]] towards the North-West Pacific and some had even settled in the Kurils.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lensen|first=George|title=Early Russo-Japanese Relations|journal=The Far East Quarterly|year=1950|volume=10|issue=1}}</ref> Prior attempts to map the islands had proved difficult due to the mists that rose from the islands as well as strong winds. The expedition would sail in the summer when conditions would be optimal and then Golovnin would continue to the Shantar Islands. The ''Diana'' left [[Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky]] on 25 April through the ice-flows and set to sea from [[Avacha Bay]] on 4 May. Golovnin was conscientious of respecting relations between Russia and Japan as his voyage followed several diplomatic incidents with Japan such as the castaway incident of [[Daikokuya K\u014dday\u016b]] in 1784, the [[Adam Laxman]] incident of 1791 and [[Nikolai Rezanov|Nikolai Rezanov's]] failed trade mission in 1805. Rezanov who then visited the [[United States]] was brought back to Siberia by Lieutenant Chwostoff in vessels belonging to the [[Russian-American Company]] but died when he reached Siberia in 1807. Chwostoff, however, proceeded to raid Japanese villages in [[Sakhalin]] and the Kurils without [[Tsardom of Russia|government]] authority.<ref>Golovnin. pp. 6-19.</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Wildes|first=Harry|title=Russia\u2019s attempts to open Japan|journal=Russian Review|volume=5|issue=1|page=76|doi=10.2307/125540}}</ref>\nThe ''Diana'' sailed to the island of [[Iturup|Eetooroop]] and made contact with a group of [[Ainu people|Ainu]] (or Kuriles) who had been sent by the Japanese to investigate the [[Europeans]]. Golovnin proceeded to meet the Japanese military commander of the island, declaring his intention to collect wood and water and then be on his way. The commander stated that they couldn't trust the Russians due to the actions of Chwostoff, he agreed to send a letter to other commanders granting them access to supplies at the town of 'Oorbeetsch'.<ref>Golovnin. pp. 20-27</ref> The Russians set sail, but were then intercepted by a [[Umiak|baidara]] with the Kuriles on board, as well as a newcomer; Alexei Maximovitsch. Alexei joined the Russians as an interpreter, though his proficiency in Russian was low. Many of these Kuriles came from Russian-controlled islands and had been punished for Chwostoff's attack on Japanese settlements, thus feared and resented the Japanese.<ref>Golovnin. pp. 28-37</ref> Moreover, the Japanese had brutally crushed an Ainu [[Menashi-Kunashir Rebellion|rebellion]] in 1789.<ref>{{cite book|last=Walker|first=Brett|title=The Conquest of Ainu Lands: Ecology and Culture in Japanese Expansion 1590-1800|year=2001|publisher=University of California Press|pages=172\u201376}}</ref>\n\n== Capture ==\n\nEuropean explorers had not yet discovered [[Nemuro Strait]] between [[Hokkaido]] (Matsmai) and [[Kunashir]], prompting Golovnin to explore them on 4 July. As the ''Diana'' approached the harbour at Kunashir, it was fired upon by the Japanese castle. After several attempts, the ''Diana'' made contact with Japanese officers on the island. They offered the necessary supplies as well as a meeting with the island's [[Bugy\u014d]] or governor. So as to clear the Russian government of responsibility from the Chwostoff raids, Golovnin, two officers, four sailors and the Kurile Alexei landed. There they were met by the governor of Kunashir in his castle. Negotiations seemed amicable, but the Japanese had lured Golovnin onto the island and arrested him and the other crew members.<ref>Golovnin. pp. 48-75</ref> \n\nThe crew was tightly bound with ropes whilst the ''Diana'', now under control of Petr Rikord, shot at the castle but was then forced to set sail to avoid capture.<ref>Golovnin. pp. 76-79</ref> The captives were sailed across the straits to Hokkaido and encountered many villagers who were curious to see the Russians, due to the almost complete absence of foreigners in Japan. A Japanese drawing of their captivity shows the Russians' tall stature compared to the Japanese, which is also confirmed by Golovnin. The crew was led to a prison in [[Hakodate]], the capital of Hokkaido.\n\n== Captivity ==\n\nThe crew were kept in separate cells in a well guarded wooden prison. During the imprisonment, the Japanese began interrogating the officers with many precise questions, revealing the lack of knowledge that both cultures had for the other. On 25 August, the commander brought Golovnin his personal wares from his cabin on the Diana, much to his surprise, but the ''Diana'' had not been captured but had simply sent these items ashore. He was later brought before the governor of Hokkaido and made to discuss the events that took place by Resanov and Chwostoff. The governor handed him a letter from the remaining officers of the ''Diana'' who explained why they were not able to save them in the Kurils and that they would work towards their release. Golovnin was also provided with another letter written in 1806 by Chwostoff, stating that he had annexed the island of [[Sakhalin]] in the name of the [[Tsar]]. The Japanese had also annexed Sakhalin in 1807 in fear of growing Russian interference.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lower|first=Arthur|title=Ocean of Destiny: A concise History of the North Pacific, 1500-1978|year=1978|publisher=UBC|page=87}}</ref> The letter convinced many of the Japanese that Golovnin was a Russian [[spy]].<ref>Golovnin. pp. 141-170</ref> The Japanese continued pressing questions to Golovnin and he and the crew were moved to a new prison in [[Matsumae, Hokkaido|Matsumae]].[[File:Vasily Golovnin during captivity.JPG|thumb|Japanese Illustration of Golovnin]]\n\nAfter in depth interrogations for weeks, the governor of Hokkaido contacted the [[Tokugawa Shogunate|central government]] in [[Edo]] to ask whether the Russians could be released.
