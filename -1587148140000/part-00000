Thus at least some portions of the Bible have been translated into 3,384 languages.<ref>{{cite web |title=2019 Bible Translation Statistics |url=http://www.wycliffe.net/statistics |website=Wycliffe |accessdate=26 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe Latin [[Vulgate]] was dominant in [[Western Christianity]] through the Middle Ages.  Since then, the Bible has been translated into [[Bible translations by language|many more languages]].\n\n[[English Bible translations]] also have a rich and varied history of more than a millennium. (See also [[List of English Bible translations]].)\n\n==Original text==\n===Hebrew Bible===\nThe [[Hebrew Bible]] was mainly written in [[Biblical Hebrew]], with some portions (notably in [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] and [[Book of Ezra|Ezra]]) in [[Biblical Aramaic]]. From the 6th century to the 10th century CE, Jewish scholars, today known as [[Masoretes]], compared the text of all known [[biblical manuscript]]s in an effort to create a unified, standardized text. A series of highly similar texts eventually emerged, and any of these texts are known as [[Masoretic Texts]] (MT). The Masoretes also added vowel points (called [[niqqud]]) to the text, since the original text contained [[Abjad|only consonants]]. This sometimes required the selection of an interpretation; since some words differ only in their vowels their meaning can vary in accordance with the vowels chosen. In antiquity, variant Hebrew readings existed, some of which have survived in the [[Samaritan Pentateuch]] and other ancient fragments, as well as being attested in ancient versions in other languages.<ref name=\"Cohen1979\">Menachem Cohen, [http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/dilugim/CohenArt/ The Idea of the Sanctity of the Biblical Text and the Science of Textual Criticism] in ''HaMikrah V'anachnu'', ed.

Revised by Gordon M. Messing. {{ISBN|9780674362505}}. Harvard University Press, 1956. Introduction F, N-2, p. 4A</ref> The ''autographs'', the Greek [[biblical manuscript|manuscripts]] written by the original authors, have not survived. Scholars surmise the original Greek text from the manuscripts that do survive. The three main textual traditions of the Greek New Testament are sometimes called the [[Alexandrian text-type]], the [[Byzantine text-type]], and the [[Western text-type]].\n\nMost variants among the manuscripts are minor, such as alternative spelling, alternative word order, the presence or absence of an optional definite article (\"the\"), and so on. Occasionally, a major variant happens when a portion of a text was missing or for other reasons. Examples of major variants are the [[Mark 16|endings of Mark]], the [[Pericope Adulter\u00e6]], the [[Comma Johanneum]], and the [[Acts of the Apostles#Manuscripts|Western version of Acts]].\n\nThe discovery of older manuscripts which belong to the Alexandrian text-type, including the 4th-century [[Codex Vaticanus]] and [[Codex Sinaiticus]], led scholars to revise their view about the original Greek text. [[Karl Lachmann]] based his [[Textual criticism|critical edition]] of 1831 on manuscripts dating from the 4th century and earlier, to argue that the ''[[Textus Receptus]]'' must be corrected according to these earlier texts.\n\nEarly manuscripts of the [[Pauline epistles]] and other New Testament writings show [[Greek orthography|no punctuation]] whatsoever.<ref>http://greek-language.com/grklinguist/?p=657.</ref><ref>http://www.stpaulsirvine.org/images/papyruslg.gif| shows an example of the text without punctuation</ref> The [[punctuation]] was added later by other editors, according to their own understanding of the text.\n\n==History==\n=== Ancient translations ===\n\n\n====Aramaic Targums====\n{{main article|Targum}}\nSome of the first translations of the [[Torah]] began during the [[Babylonian exile]], when [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] became the [[lingua franca]] of the Jews. With most people speaking only Aramaic and not understanding Hebrew, the [[Targum]]s were created to allow the common person to understand the Torah as it was read in ancient [[synagogue]]s.\n\n====Greek Septuagint====\n{{main article|Septuagint}}\nBy the 3rd century BC, [[Alexandria]] had become the center of [[Hellenistic Judaism]], and during the 3rd to 2nd centuries BC translators compiled in Egypt a [[Koine Greek]] version of the Hebrew scriptures in several stages (completing the task by 132 BC). The [[Talmud]] ascribes the translation effort to [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]] ([[r.]] 285\u2013246 BC), who allegedly hired 72 Jewish scholars for the purpose, for which reason the translation is commonly known as the Septuagint (from the Latin ''septuaginta'', \"seventy\"), a name which it gained in \"the time of [[Augustine of Hippo]]\" (354\u2013430 AD).<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | last = Sundberg | first = Albert C., Jr. | editor = McDonald, Lee Martin |editor2=Sanders, James A. | encyclopedia = The Canon Debate | title = The Septuagint: The Bible of Hellenistic Judaism | year = 2002 | publisher = Hendrickson Publishers | isbn = 978-1-56563-517-3 | pages = 72 }}</ref><ref>''The Canon Debate'', McDonald & Sanders editors, chapter by Sundberg, page 72, adds further detail: \"However, it was not until the time of [[Augustine of Hippo]] (354-430 CE) that the Greek translation of the Jewish scriptures came to be called by the Latin term ''septuaginta''. [70 rather than 72]\n\nJerome began by revising the earlier Latin translations, but ended by going back to the original Greek, bypassing all translations, and going back to the original Hebrew wherever he could instead of the Septuagint.\nThe New Testament and at least some of the Old Testament was translated into [[Gothic language|Gothic]] in the 4th century by [[Ulfilas]]. In the 5th century, [[Saint Mesrob]] translated the Bible into [[Armenian language|Armenian]]. Also dating from the same period are the [[Peshitta|Syriac]], [[Coptic language|Coptic]], [[Ge'ez language|Ethiopic]] and [[Georgian language|Georgian]] translations.\n\nIn his ''City of God'' 18.42, while repeating the [[Letter of Aristeas|story of Aristeas]] with typical embellishments, Augustine adds the remark, \"It is their translation that it has now become traditional to call the Septuagint\" ...[Latin omitted]... Augustine thus indicates that this name for the Greek translation of the scriptures was a recent development. But he offers no clue as to which of the possible antecedents led to this development: {{bibleverse||Exod|24:1-8}}, [[Josephus]] [Antiquities 12.57, 12.86], or an elision. ...this name ''Septuagint'' appears to have been a fourth- to fifth-century development.\"</ref> The Septuagint (LXX), the very first translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]] into [[Greek language|Greek]], later became the accepted text of the [[Old Testament]] in the Christian church and the basis of its [[Biblical canon|canon]]. [[Jerome]] based his Latin [[Vulgate]] translation on the Hebrew for those books of the Bible preserved in the Jewish canon (as reflected in the [[Masoretic text]]), and on the Greek text for the [[deuterocanonical books]].\n\nThe translation now known as the Septuagint was widely used by Greek-speaking Jews, and later by Christians.<ref name=\"Jobes and Silva\">Karen Jobes and Moises Silva, ''Invitation to the Septuagint'', {{ISBN|1-84227-061-3}} (Paternoster Press, 2001). - The {{as of | 2001 | lc = on}} standard introductory work on the Septuagint.</ref> It differs somewhat from the later standardized Hebrew ([[Masoretic Text]]).

In some cases these additions were originally composed in Greek, while in other cases they are translations of Hebrew books or of Hebrew variants not present in the Masoretic texts. Recent discoveries have shown that more of the Septuagint additions have a Hebrew origin than previously thought. While there are no complete surviving manuscripts of the Hebrew texts on which the Septuagint was based, many{{quantify|date=March 2016}} scholars believe that they represent a different textual tradition (\"[[Vorlage]]\") from the one that became the basis for the Masoretic texts.<ref name=\"Cohen1979\">Menachem Cohen, [http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/dilugim/CohenArt/ The Idea of the Sanctity of the Biblical Text and the Science of Textual Criticism] in ''HaMikrah V'anachnu'', ed.

In addition, he included three anonymous translations of the Psalms (the ''Quinta'', ''Sexta'' and ''Septima''). His eclectic recension of the Septuagint had a significant influence on the Old Testament text in several important manuscripts. The canonical [[Christian Bible]] was formally established by Bishop [[Cyril of Jerusalem]] in 350 (although it had been generally accepted by the church previously), confirmed by the [[Council of Laodicea]] in 363 (both lacked the book of [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]]), and later established by [[Athanasius of Alexandria]] in 367 (with [[Revelation]] added), and [[Jerome]]'s ''[[Vulgate]]'' Latin translation dates to between AD 382 and 405. [[Latin]] translations predating Jerome are collectively known as ''[[Vetus Latina]]'' texts.\n\nChristian translations also tend to be based upon the Hebrew, though some denominations prefer the Septuagint (or may cite variant readings from both). Bible translations incorporating modern textual criticism usually begin with the masoretic text, but also take into account possible variants from all available ancient versions. The [[Textus Receptus|received text]] of the Christian [[New Testament]] is in [[Koine Greek]],{{efn|Some scholars hypothesize that certain books (whether completely or partially) may have been written in Aramaic before being translated for widespread dissemination. One very famous example of this is [[Logos|the opening]] to the [[Gospel of John]], which some scholars argue to be a Greek translation of an Aramaic hymn.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}}} and nearly all translations are based upon the Greek text.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nJerome began by revising the earlier Latin translations, but ended by going back to the original Greek, bypassing all translations, and going back to the original Hebrew wherever he could instead of the Septuagint.\n\nThe Bible [[Gothic Bible|was translated]] into [[Gothic language|Gothic]] in the 4th century by a group of scholars, possibly under the supervision of [[Ulfilas]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Falluomini|first1=Carla|title=The Gothic Version of the Gospels and Pauline Epistles: Cultural background, transmission and character|date=2015|publisher=De Gruyter|location=Berlin|doi=10.1515/9783110334692|isbn=9783110334692}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ratkus|first1=Art\u016bras|title=Greek \u1f00\u03c1\u03c7\u03b9\u03b5\u03c1\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2 in Gothic translation: Linguistics and theology at a crossroads|journal=NOWELE|date=2018|volume=71|issue=1|page=3\u201334|doi=10.1075/nowele.00002.rat|url=https://benjamins.com/#catalog/journals/nowele.00002.rat/details}}</ref> In the 5th century, [[Saint Mesrob]] translated the Bible using the [[Armenian alphabet]] invented by him.

[[Athanasius]] (''Apol. Const. 4'') recorded Alexandrian scribes around 340 preparing Bibles for [[Constans]]. Little else is known, though there is plenty of speculation. For example, it is speculated that this may have provided motivation for [[Biblical canon|canon lists]], and that [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209]], [[Codex Sinaiticus]] and [[Codex Alexandrinus]] are examples of these Bibles. Together with the [[Peshitta]], these are the earliest extant Christian Bibles.<ref>''The Canon Debate'', McDonald & Sanders editors, 2002, pp. 414-415, for the entire paragraph.</ref>\n\n===Middle Ages===\n{{Main article|Bible translations in the Middle Ages}}\n[[File:Devil codex Gigas.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Codex Gigas]] from the 13th century, held at the [[Swedish Royal Library|Royal Library]] in [[Sweden]].]]\nWhen ancient scribes copied earlier books, they wrote notes on the margins of the page (''marginal [[Biblical gloss|glosses]]'') to correct their text\u2014especially if a scribe accidentally omitted a word or line\u2014and to comment about the text. When later scribes were copying the copy, they were sometimes uncertain if a note was intended to be included as part of the text. See [[textual criticism]]. Over time, different regions evolved different versions, each with its own assemblage of omissions, additions, and variants (mostly in [[orthography]]).\n\nThe earliest surviving complete manuscript of the entire Bible in Latin is the [[Codex Amiatinus]], a Latin Vulgate edition produced in 8th-century England at the double monastery of [[Monkwearmouth-Jarrow Abbey|Wearmouth-Jarrow]].\n\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]], translation, particularly of the Old Testament was discouraged. Nevertheless, there are some fragmentary [[Old English Bible translations]], notably a lost translation of the [[Gospel of John]] into Old English by the Venerable [[Bede]], which is said to have been prepared shortly before his death around the year 735. An [[Old High German]] version of the gospel of Matthew dates to 748. [[Charlemagne]] in ca. 800 charged [[Alcuin]] with a revision of the Latin Vulgate. The translation into [[Old Church Slavonic]] was started in 863 by [[Cyril and Methodius]].\n\n[[Alfred the Great]] had a number of passages of the Bible circulated in the vernacular in around 900. These included passages from the [[Ten Commandments]] and the [[Pentateuch]], which he prefixed to a code of laws he promulgated around this time. In approximately 990, a full and freestanding version of the four Gospels in idiomatic Old English appeared, in the [[West Saxon dialect (Old English)|West Saxon]] dialect; these are called the ''[[Wessex Gospels]]''. Around the same time, a compilation now called the ''[[Old English Hexateuch]]'' appeared with the first six (or, in one version, seven) books of the Old Testament.\n\n[[Pope Innocent III]] in 1199 [[censorship of the Bible|banned]] unauthorized versions of the Bible as a reaction to the [[Cathar]] and [[Waldensian]] heresies. The [[Council of Toulouse|synods of Toulouse]] and Tarragona (1234) outlawed possession of such renderings. There is evidence of some vernacular translations being permitted while others were being scrutinized.\n\nThe complete Bible was translated into Old French in the late 13th century. Parts of this translation were included in editions of the popular ''Bible historiale'', and there is no evidence of this translation being suppressed by the Church.<ref>Sneddon, Clive R. 1993. \"A neglected mediaeval Bible translation.\" ''Romance Languages Annual'' 5(1): 11-16 [http://tell.fll.purdue.edu/RLA-Archive/1993/French-html/Sneddon,Clive.htm].</ref> The entire Bible was translated into Czech around 1360.\n\nThe most notable [[Middle English Bible translation]], [[Wycliffe's Bible]] (1383), based on the Vulgate, was banned by the Oxford Synod in 1408. A Hungarian [[Hussite]] Bible appeared in the mid 15th century, and in 1478, a Catalan translation in the dialect of [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencia]].  Many parts of the Bible were printed by [[William Caxton]] in his translation of the [[Golden Legend]], and in ''Speculum Vitae Christi'' (''[[The Mirror of the Blessed Life of Jesus Christ]]'').\n\n===Reformation and Early Modern period===\n{{See also|Early Modern English Bible translations}}\n[[File:Bible Kralicka.JPG|thumb|250px|Czech Protestant [[Bible of Kralice]] (1593)]]\nThe earliest printed edition of the Greek New Testament appeared in 1516 from the [[Johann Froben|Froben]] press, by [[Erasmus|Desiderius Erasmus]], who reconstructed its Greek text from several recent manuscripts of the Byzantine text-type. He occasionally added a Greek translation of the Latin Vulgate for parts that did not exist in the Greek manuscripts. He produced four later editions of this text. Erasmus was Roman Catholic, but his preference for the [[Byzantine Greek]] manuscripts rather than the [[Latin Vulgate]] led some church authorities to view him with suspicion.\n\nDuring 1517 and 1519 [[Francysk Skaryna]] printed a translation of the Bible in [[Old Belarusian language]] in twenty-two books.<ref>\u041f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0431\u0438\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u044f \u0413\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0438\u044f (\u0414\u043e\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430 \u043c\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0446\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0438 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043d\u0430\u0443\u043a \u0424\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0430) \u0421\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043d\u044b, \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0438\u043b \u0423\u043b\u044f\u0445\u0438\u043d, \u041f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0446\u043a, 1994</ref>\n\nIn 1521, [[Martin Luther]] was placed under the [[Imperial ban|Ban of the Empire]], and he retired to the [[Wartburg Castle]]. During his time there, he translated the New Testament from Greek into German. It was printed in September 1522. The first complete Dutch Bible, partly based on the existing portions of Luther's translation, was printed in [[Antwerp]] in 1526 by [[Jacob van Liesvelt]].<ref>Paul Arblaster, Gergely Juh\u00e1sz, Guido Latr\u00e9 (eds) Tyndale's Testament, Brepols 2002, {{ISBN|2-503-51411-1}}, p. 120.</ref>\n\nThe first printed edition with ''[[critical apparatus]]'' (noting variant readings among the manuscripts) was produced by the printer [[Robert Estienne]] of Paris in 1550. The Greek text of this edition and of those of Erasmus became known as the ''[[Textus Receptus]]'' (Latin for \"received text\"), a name given to it in the [[House of Elzevir|Elzevier]] edition of 1633, which termed it as the text ''nunc ab omnibus receptum'' (\"now received by all\").\n\nThe use of numbered chapters and verses was not introduced until the Middle Ages and later. The system used in English was developed by Stephanus ([[Robert Estienne]] of Paris) (see [[Chapters and verses of the Bible]])\n\nLater critical editions incorporate ongoing scholarly research, including discoveries of Greek papyrus fragments from near Alexandria, Egypt, that date in some cases within a few decades of the original New Testament writings.<ref>Metzger, Bruce R. ''Manuscripts of the Greek Bible: An Introduction to Paleography'' (Oxford University Press, 1981) cf. [[Papyrus 52]].</ref> Today, most critical editions of the Greek New Testament, such as UBS4 and [[NA27]], consider the Alexandrian text-type corrected by papyri, to be the Greek text that is closest to the original ''autographs''. Their ''apparatus'' includes the result of votes among scholars, ranging from certain {A} to doubtful {E}, on which variants best preserve the original Greek text of the New Testament.\n\nCritical editions that rely primarily on the Alexandrian text-type inform nearly all modern translations (and revisions of older translations). For reasons of tradition, however, some translators prefer to use the Textus Receptus for the Greek text, or use the ''[[Majority Text]]'' which is similar to it but is a critical edition that relies on earlier manuscripts of the Byzantine text-type. Among these, some argue that the Byzantine tradition contains scribal additions, but these later interpolations preserve the orthodox interpretations of the biblical text\u2014as part of the ongoing Christian experience\u2014and in this sense are authoritative. Distrust of the textual basis of modern translations has contributed to the [[King-James-Only Movement]].\n\nThe churches of the [[Protestant Reformation]] translated the Greek of the Textus Receptus to produce [[vernacular]] Bibles, such as the German [[Luther Bible]] (1522), the Polish [[Brest Bible]] (1563), the Spanish \"Biblia del Oso\" (in English: Bible of the Bear, 1569) which later became the [[Reina-Valera]] Bible upon its first revision in 1602, the Czech [[Melantrich Bible]] (1549) and [[Bible of Kralice]] (1579-1593) and numerous English translations of the Bible. [[William Tyndale|Tyndale's]] [[Tyndale's Bible|New Testament translation]] (1526, revised in 1534, 1535 and 1536) and his translation of the [[Pentateuch]] (1530, 1534) and the [[Book of Jonah]] were met with heavy sanctions given the widespread belief that Tyndale ''changed'' the Bible as he attempted to translate it. Tyndale's unfinished work, cut short by his execution, was supplemented by [[Myles Coverdale]] and published under a pseudonym to create the [[Matthew Bible]], the first complete English translation of the Bible. Attempts at an \"authoritative\" English Bible for the [[Church of England]] would include the [[Great Bible]] of 1538 (also relying on Coverdale's work), the [[Bishops' Bible]] of 1568, and the Authorized Version (the [[King James Version]]) of 1611, the last of which would become a standard for English speaking Christians for several centuries.\n\nThe first complete French Bible was a translation by [[Jacques Lef\u00e8vre d'\u00c9taples]], published in 1530 in [[Antwerp]].<ref>Paul Arblaster, Gergely Juh\u00e1sz, Guido Latr\u00e9 (eds) Tyndale's Testament, Brepols 2002, {{ISBN|2-503-51411-1}}, pp. 134-135.</ref> The [[Froschauer Bible]] of 1531 and the [[Luther Bible]] of 1534 (both appearing in portions throughout the 1520s) were an important part of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]].\n\nThe first English translations of [[Psalms]] (1530), [[Isaiah]] (1531), [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] (1533), [[Ecclesiastes]] (1533), [[Jeremiah]] (1534) and [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]] (1534), were executed by the Protestant Bible translator [[George Joye]] in [[Antwerp]]. In 1535 Myles Coverdale published the first complete [[Coverdale Bible|English Bible]] also in [[Antwerp]].<ref>Paul Arblaster, Gergely Juh\u00e1sz, Guido Latr\u00e9 (eds) Tyndale's Testament, Brepols 2002, {{ISBN|2-503-51411-1}}, pp. 143-145.</ref>\n\nBy 1578 both Old and New Testaments were translated to [[Slovene language|Slovene]] by the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] writer and theologian [[Jurij Dalmatin]]. The work was not printed until 1583. The [[Slovenes]] thus became the 12th nation in the world with a complete Bible in their language. The translation of the New Testament was based on the work by Dalmatin's mentor, the Protestant [[Primo\u017e Trubar]], who published the translation of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] already in 1555 and the entire testament by parts until 1577.\n\nFollowing the distribution of a Welsh New Testament and Prayer Book to every parish Church in Wales in 1567, translated by [[William Salesbury]], Welsh became the 13th language into which the whole Bible had been translated in 1588, through a translation by William Morgan, the bishop of Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant.<ref>J.

It was realised that, at the rates of Bible translation at that point, it would take until at least 2150 until Bible translation began in every language that was needing a translation. Since the launch of Vision 2025, Bible translation efforts have increased dramatically, in large part due to the technology that is now available. Due to the increase, at current rates, Bible translation will begin in every language by 2038, thus being 112 years faster.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Creson |first1=Bob |title=Bible Translation as We Approach 2025 What's Been Accomplished and What Remains |url=https://www.missionfrontiers.org/issue/article/bible-translation-as-we-approach-2025 |website=Mission Frontiers |accessdate=26 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nAs of October 2019, they estimated that around 171 million people, speak those 2,115 languages where translation work still needs to begin. In total, there are 3,969 languages without any bible translation at all, but many of these are likely to never need a Bible because they are very similar to other languages, or spoken by very few speakers.<ref>{{cite web |title=2019 Bible Translation Statistics |url=http://www.wycliffe.net/statistics. |website=Wycliffe |accessdate=26 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Differences in Bible translations ==\n[[File:Gutenberg Bible.jpg|thumb|This [[Gutenberg Bible]] is displayed by the United States [[Library of Congress]]]]\n{{Further|Dynamic and formal equivalence|Bible version debate}}\n\n===Dynamic or formal translation policy===\nA variety of linguistic, philological and ideological approaches to translation have been used. Inside the Bible-translation community, these are commonly categorized as:\n* [[Dynamic equivalence]] translation\n* [[Formal equivalence]] translation (similar to [[literal translation]])\n* [[Idiomatic]], or [[Paraphrase|paraphrastic]] translation, as used by the late [[Kenneth N. Taylor]]\n\nthough modern linguists, such as Bible scholar Dr. Joel Hoffman, disagree with this classification.<ref>[http://goddidntsaythat.com/2009/10/05/formal-equivalence-and-dynamic-equivalence-a-false-dichotom/ \"Formal Equivalence and Dynamic Equivalence: A False Dichotomy\"]</ref>\n\nAs [[Hebrew]] and [[Koine Greek|Greek]], the original languages of the Bible, like all languages, have some [[idiom]]s and concepts [[Untranslatability|not easily translated]], there is in some cases an ongoing critical tension about whether it is better to give a word for word translation or to give a translation that gives a parallel idiom in the target language. For instance, in the [[Douay Rheims Bible]], [[Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition]], [[New American Bible Revised Edition]], which are the English language [[Catholic]] translations, as well as [[Protestant]] translations like the [[King James Bible]], the [[Darby Bible]], the [[Recovery Version]], the [[New Revised Standard Version]], the [[Modern Literal Version]], and the [[New American Standard Bible]] are seen as more literal translations (or \"word for word\"), whereas translations like the [[New International Version]] and [[New Living Translation]] sometimes attempt to give relevant parallel idioms. [[The Living Bible]] and [[The Message (Bible)|The Message]] are two paraphrases of the Bible that try to convey the original meaning in contemporary language. The further away one gets from word for word translation, the easier the text becomes to read while relying more on the theological, linguistic or cultural understanding of the translator, which one would not normally expect a lay reader to require. On the other hand, as one gets closer to a word for word translation, the text becomes more literal but still relies on similar problems of meaningful translation at the word level and makes it difficult for lay readers to interpret due to their unfamiliarity with ancient idioms and other historical and cultural contexts.\n\n===Doctrinal differences and translation policy===\n {{Further|Tetragrammaton in the New Testament}}\nIn addition to linguistic concerns, theological issues also drive Bible translations. Some translations of the Bible, produced by single churches or groups of churches, may be seen as subject to a point of view by the translation committee.\n\nFor example, the [[New World Translation]], produced by [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], provides different renderings where verses in other Bible translations support the deity of Christ.<ref>http://www.jw.org/en/jehovahs-witnesses/faq/new-world-translation-accurate/#?insight[search_id]=ab273185-8135-4ee9-a212-210cef439f3e&insight[search_result_index]=0</ref> The NWT also translates ''kurios'' as \"[[Jehovah]]\" rather than \"Lord\" when quoting Hebrew passages that used YHWH. The authors believe that Jesus would have used God's name and not the customary ''kurios''. On this basis, the anonymous New World Bible Translation Committee inserted ''Jehovah'' into the New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures (New Testament) a total of 237 times while the New World Translation of the Hebrew Scriptures (Old Testament) uses Jehovah a total of 6,979 times to a grand total of 7,216 in the entire 2013 Revision New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures while previous revisions such as the 1984 revision were a total of 7,210 times while the 1961 revision were a total of 7,199 times.<ref>''New World Translation'' appendix, pp. 1564-1566. When discussing \u201cRestoring the Divine Name,\u201d the New World Bible Translation Committee states: \u201cTo know where the divine name was replaced by the Greek words \u039a\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 and \u0398\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2, we have determined where the inspired Christian writers have quoted verses, passages and expressions from the Hebrew Scriptures and then we have referred back to the Hebrew text to ascertain whether the divine name appears there. In this way we determined the identity to give Ky\u02b9ri\u00b7os and The\u00b7os\u02b9 and the personality with which to clothe them.\u201d Explaining further, the Committee said: \u201cTo avoid overstepping the bounds of a translator into the field of exegesis, we have been most cautious about rendering the divine name in the Christian Greek Scriptures, always carefully considering the Hebrew Scriptures as a background. We have looked for agreement from the Hebrew versions to confirm our rendering.\u201d Such agreement from Hebrew versions exists in all the 237 places that the New World Bible Translation Committee has rendered the divine name in the body of its translation.\u2014NW appendix, pp. 1564-1566</ref>\n\nA number of [[Sacred Name Bibles]] (e.g., the [[Sacred Scriptures Bethel Edition]]) have been published that are even more rigorous in transliterating the tetragrammaton using Semitic forms to translate it in the Old Testament and also using the same Semitic forms to translate the Greek word ''Theos'' (God) in the New Testament\u2014usually Yahweh, Elohim or some other variation.\n\nOther translations are distinguished by smaller but distinctive doctrinal differences. For example, the [[Purified Translation of the Bible]], by translation and explanatory footnotes, promoting the position that Christians should not drink alcohol, that New Testament references to \"wine\" are translated as \"grape juice\".\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Bible}}\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n; Ancient and classical translations&#x3a;\n* [[Coptic versions of the Bible]]\n* [[Syriac versions of the Bible]]\n* [[Targum]] and [[Peshitta]] (Aramaic)\n* [[Vetus Latina]] and [[Vulgate]] (Latin)\n\n;English translations&#x3a;\n* [[Early Modern English Bible translations]]\n* [[English translations of the Bible]]\n* [[Jewish English Bible translations]]\n* [[Old English Bible translations]]\n* [[Middle English Bible translations]]\n* [[Modern English Bible translations]]\n\n; Other languages&#x3a;\n* [[Bible translations by language]]\n* [[Naro Bible]]\n* [[Bible translations into Ladakhi]]\n* [[Bible translations into the languages of Africa]]\n* [[Bible translations into the languages of India]]\n* [[Bible translations into the languages of Indonesia]]\n\n;Difficulties&#x3a;\n* [[Gender in Bible translation]]\n* [[Texas sharpshooter fallacy#Translation and interpretation]]\n* [[Translation#Fidelity and transparency]]\n\n;Others&#x3a;\n* [[Bibledit]]\n* [[Bible version debate]]\n* [[Byzantine text-type]]\n* [[Bible concordance]]\n* [[Exegesis]]\n* [[Hermeneutics]]\n* [[Institute for Bible Translation]]\n* [[List of languages by year of first Bible translation]]\n* [[Skopos theory]]\n* [[Textus Receptus]]\n* [[Textual variants in the New Testament]]\n* [[Translation]]\n}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Garry Wills|Wills, Garry]], \"A Wild and Indecent Book\" (review of [[David Bentley Hart]], ''The New Testament:  A Translation'', [[Yale University Press]], 577 pp.), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol.

Since then, the Bible has been translated into [[Bible translations by language|many more languages]].\n\n[[English Bible translations]] also have a rich and varied history of more than a millennium. (See also [[List of English Bible translations]].)\n\n==Original text==\n===Hebrew Bible===\nThe [[Hebrew Bible]] was mainly written in [[Biblical Hebrew]], with some portions (notably in [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] and [[Book of Ezra|Ezra]]) in [[Biblical Aramaic]]. From the 6th century to the 10th century CE, Jewish scholars, today known as [[Masoretes]], compared the text of all known [[biblical manuscript]]s in an effort to create a unified, standardized text. A series of highly similar texts eventually emerged, and any of these texts are known as [[Masoretic Texts]] (MT). The Masoretes also added vowel points (called [[niqqud]]) to the text, since the original text contained [[Abjad|only consonants]]. This sometimes required the selection of an interpretation; since some words differ only in their vowels their meaning can vary in accordance with the vowels chosen. In antiquity, variant Hebrew readings existed, some of which have survived in the [[Samaritan Pentateuch]] and other ancient fragments, as well as being attested in ancient versions in other languages.<ref name=\"Cohen1979\">Menachem Cohen, [http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/dilugim/CohenArt/ The Idea of the Sanctity of the Biblical Text and the Science of Textual Criticism] in ''HaMikrah V'anachnu'', ed.

Revised by Gordon M. Messing. {{ISBN|9780674362505}}. Harvard University Press, 1956. Introduction F, N-2, p. 4A</ref> The ''autographs'', the Greek [[biblical manuscript|manuscripts]] written by the original authors, have not survived. Scholars surmise the original Greek text from the manuscripts that do survive. The three main textual traditions of the Greek New Testament are sometimes called the [[Alexandrian text-type]], the [[Byzantine text-type]], and the [[Western text-type]].\n\nMost variants among the manuscripts are minor, such as alternative spelling, alternative word order, the presence or absence of an optional definite article (\"the\"), and so on. Occasionally, a major variant happens when a portion of a text was missing or for other reasons. Examples of major variants are the [[Mark 16|endings of Mark]], the [[Pericope Adulter\u00e6]], the [[Comma Johanneum]], and the [[Acts of the Apostles#Manuscripts|Western version of Acts]].\n\nThe discovery of older manuscripts which belong to the Alexandrian text-type, including the 4th-century [[Codex Vaticanus]] and [[Codex Sinaiticus]], led scholars to revise their view about the original Greek text. [[Karl Lachmann]] based his [[Textual criticism|critical edition]] of 1831 on manuscripts dating from the 4th century and earlier, to argue that the ''[[Textus Receptus]]'' must be corrected according to these earlier texts.\n\nEarly manuscripts of the [[Pauline epistles]] and other New Testament writings show [[Greek orthography|no punctuation]] whatsoever.<ref>http://greek-language.com/grklinguist/?p=657.</ref><ref>http://www.stpaulsirvine.org/images/papyruslg.gif| shows an example of the text without punctuation</ref> The [[punctuation]] was added later by other editors, according to their own understanding of the text.\n\n==History==\n=== Ancient translations ===\n\n\n====Aramaic Targums====\n{{main article|Targum}}\nSome of the first translations of the [[Torah]] began during the [[Babylonian exile]], when [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] became the [[lingua franca]] of the Jews. With most people speaking only Aramaic and not understanding Hebrew, the [[Targum]]s were created to allow the common person to understand the Torah as it was read in ancient [[synagogue]]s.\n\n====Greek Septuagint====\n{{main article|Septuagint}}\nBy the 3rd century BC, [[Alexandria]] had become the center of [[Hellenistic Judaism]], and during the 3rd to 2nd centuries BC translators compiled in Egypt a [[Koine Greek]] version of the Hebrew scriptures in several stages (completing the task by 132 BC). The [[Talmud]] ascribes the translation effort to [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]] ([[r.]] 285\u2013246 BC), who allegedly hired 72 Jewish scholars for the purpose, for which reason the translation is commonly known as the Septuagint (from the Latin ''septuaginta'', \"seventy\"), a name which it gained in \"the time of [[Augustine of Hippo]]\" (354\u2013430 AD).<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | last = Sundberg | first = Albert C., Jr. | editor = McDonald, Lee Martin |editor2=Sanders, James A. | encyclopedia = The Canon Debate | title = The Septuagint: The Bible of Hellenistic Judaism | year = 2002 | publisher = Hendrickson Publishers | isbn = 978-1-56563-517-3 | pages = 72 }}</ref><ref>''The Canon Debate'', McDonald & Sanders editors, chapter by Sundberg, page 72, adds further detail: \"However, it was not until the time of [[Augustine of Hippo]] (354-430 CE) that the Greek translation of the Jewish scriptures came to be called by the Latin term ''septuaginta''. [70 rather than 72]\n\nJerome began by revising the earlier Latin translations, but ended by going back to the original Greek, bypassing all translations, and going back to the original Hebrew wherever he could instead of the Septuagint.\nThe New Testament and at least some of the Old Testament was translated into [[Gothic language|Gothic]] in the 4th century by [[Ulfilas]]. In the 5th century, [[Saint Mesrob]] translated the Bible into [[Armenian language|Armenian]]. Also dating from the same period are the [[Peshitta|Syriac]], [[Coptic language|Coptic]], [[Ge'ez language|Ethiopic]] and [[Georgian language|Georgian]] translations.\n\nIn his ''City of God'' 18.42, while repeating the [[Letter of Aristeas|story of Aristeas]] with typical embellishments, Augustine adds the remark, \"It is their translation that it has now become traditional to call the Septuagint\" ...[Latin omitted]... Augustine thus indicates that this name for the Greek translation of the scriptures was a recent development. But he offers no clue as to which of the possible antecedents led to this development: {{bibleverse||Exod|24:1-8}}, [[Josephus]] [Antiquities 12.57, 12.86], or an elision. ...this name ''Septuagint'' appears to have been a fourth- to fifth-century development.\"</ref> The Septuagint (LXX), the very first translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]] into [[Greek language|Greek]], later became the accepted text of the [[Old Testament]] in the Christian church and the basis of its [[Biblical canon|canon]]. [[Jerome]] based his Latin [[Vulgate]] translation on the Hebrew for those books of the Bible preserved in the Jewish canon (as reflected in the [[Masoretic text]]), and on the Greek text for the [[deuterocanonical books]].\n\nThe translation now known as the Septuagint was widely used by Greek-speaking Jews, and later by Christians.<ref name=\"Jobes and Silva\">Karen Jobes and Moises Silva, ''Invitation to the Septuagint'', {{ISBN|1-84227-061-3}} (Paternoster Press, 2001). - The {{as of | 2001 | lc = on}} standard introductory work on the Septuagint.</ref> It differs somewhat from the later standardized Hebrew ([[Masoretic Text]]).

In some cases these additions were originally composed in Greek, while in other cases they are translations of Hebrew books or of Hebrew variants not present in the Masoretic texts. Recent discoveries have shown that more of the Septuagint additions have a Hebrew origin than previously thought. While there are no complete surviving manuscripts of the Hebrew texts on which the Septuagint was based, many{{quantify|date=March 2016}} scholars believe that they represent a different textual tradition (\"[[Vorlage]]\") from the one that became the basis for the Masoretic texts.<ref name=\"Cohen1979\">Menachem Cohen, [http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/dilugim/CohenArt/ The Idea of the Sanctity of the Biblical Text and the Science of Textual Criticism] in ''HaMikrah V'anachnu'', ed.

In addition, he included three anonymous translations of the Psalms (the ''Quinta'', ''Sexta'' and ''Septima''). His eclectic recension of the Septuagint had a significant influence on the Old Testament text in several important manuscripts. The canonical [[Christian Bible]] was formally established by Bishop [[Cyril of Jerusalem]] in 350 (although it had been generally accepted by the church previously), confirmed by the [[Council of Laodicea]] in 363 (both lacked the book of [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]]), and later established by [[Athanasius of Alexandria]] in 367 (with [[Revelation]] added), and [[Jerome]]'s ''[[Vulgate]]'' Latin translation dates to between AD 382 and 405. [[Latin]] translations predating Jerome are collectively known as ''[[Vetus Latina]]'' texts.\n\nChristian translations also tend to be based upon the Hebrew, though some denominations prefer the Septuagint (or may cite variant readings from both). Bible translations incorporating modern textual criticism usually begin with the masoretic text, but also take into account possible variants from all available ancient versions. The [[Textus Receptus|received text]] of the Christian [[New Testament]] is in [[Koine Greek]],{{efn|Some scholars hypothesize that certain books (whether completely or partially) may have been written in Aramaic before being translated for widespread dissemination.

[[Athanasius]] (''Apol. Const. 4'') recorded Alexandrian scribes around 340 preparing Bibles for [[Constans]]. Little else is known, though there is plenty of speculation. For example, it is speculated that this may have provided motivation for [[Biblical canon|canon lists]], and that [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209]], [[Codex Sinaiticus]] and [[Codex Alexandrinus]] are examples of these Bibles. Together with the [[Peshitta]], these are the earliest extant Christian Bibles.<ref>''The Canon Debate'', McDonald & Sanders editors, 2002, pp. 414-415, for the entire paragraph.</ref>\n\n===Middle Ages===\n{{Main article|Bible translations in the Middle Ages}}\n[[File:Devil codex Gigas.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Codex Gigas]] from the 13th century, held at the [[Swedish Royal Library|Royal Library]] in [[Sweden]].]]\nWhen ancient scribes copied earlier books, they wrote notes on the margins of the page (''marginal [[Biblical gloss|glosses]]'') to correct their text\u2014especially if a scribe accidentally omitted a word or line\u2014and to comment about the text. When later scribes were copying the copy, they were sometimes uncertain if a note was intended to be included as part of the text. See [[textual criticism]]. Over time, different regions evolved different versions, each with its own assemblage of omissions, additions, and variants (mostly in [[orthography]]).\n\nThe earliest surviving complete manuscript of the entire Bible in Latin is the [[Codex Amiatinus]], a Latin Vulgate edition produced in 8th-century England at the double monastery of [[Monkwearmouth-Jarrow Abbey|Wearmouth-Jarrow]].\n\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]], translation, particularly of the Old Testament was discouraged. Nevertheless, there are some fragmentary [[Old English Bible translations]], notably a lost translation of the [[Gospel of John]] into Old English by the Venerable [[Bede]], which is said to have been prepared shortly before his death around the year 735. An [[Old High German]] version of the gospel of Matthew dates to 748. [[Charlemagne]] in ca. 800 charged [[Alcuin]] with a revision of the Latin Vulgate. The translation into [[Old Church Slavonic]] was started in 863 by [[Cyril and Methodius]].\n\n[[Alfred the Great]] had a number of passages of the Bible circulated in the vernacular in around 900. These included passages from the [[Ten Commandments]] and the [[Pentateuch]], which he prefixed to a code of laws he promulgated around this time. In approximately 990, a full and freestanding version of the four Gospels in idiomatic Old English appeared, in the [[West Saxon dialect (Old English)|West Saxon]] dialect; these are called the ''[[Wessex Gospels]]''. Around the same time, a compilation now called the ''[[Old English Hexateuch]]'' appeared with the first six (or, in one version, seven) books of the Old Testament.\n\n[[Pope Innocent III]] in 1199 [[censorship of the Bible|banned]] unauthorized versions of the Bible as a reaction to the [[Cathar]] and [[Waldensian]] heresies. The [[Council of Toulouse|synods of Toulouse]] and Tarragona (1234) outlawed possession of such renderings. There is evidence of some vernacular translations being permitted while others were being scrutinized.\n\nThe complete Bible was translated into Old French in the late 13th century. Parts of this translation were included in editions of the popular ''Bible historiale'', and there is no evidence of this translation being suppressed by the Church.<ref>Sneddon, Clive R. 1993. \"A neglected mediaeval Bible translation.\" ''Romance Languages Annual'' 5(1): 11-16 [http://tell.fll.purdue.edu/RLA-Archive/1993/French-html/Sneddon,Clive.htm].</ref> The entire Bible was translated into Czech around 1360.\n\nThe most notable [[Middle English Bible translation]], [[Wycliffe's Bible]] (1383), based on the Vulgate, was banned by the Oxford Synod in 1408. A Hungarian [[Hussite]] Bible appeared in the mid 15th century, and in 1478, a Catalan translation in the dialect of [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencia]].  Many parts of the Bible were printed by [[William Caxton]] in his translation of the [[Golden Legend]], and in ''Speculum Vitae Christi'' (''[[The Mirror of the Blessed Life of Jesus Christ]]'').\n\n===Reformation and Early Modern period===\n{{See also|Early Modern English Bible translations}}\n[[File:Bible Kralicka.JPG|thumb|250px|Czech Protestant [[Bible of Kralice]] (1593)]]\nThe earliest printed edition of the Greek New Testament appeared in 1516 from the [[Johann Froben|Froben]] press, by [[Erasmus|Desiderius Erasmus]], who reconstructed its Greek text from several recent manuscripts of the Byzantine text-type. He occasionally added a Greek translation of the Latin Vulgate for parts that did not exist in the Greek manuscripts. He produced four later editions of this text. Erasmus was Roman Catholic, but his preference for the [[Byzantine Greek]] manuscripts rather than the [[Latin Vulgate]] led some church authorities to view him with suspicion.\n\nDuring 1517 and 1519 [[Francysk Skaryna]] printed a translation of the Bible in [[Old Belarusian language]] in twenty-two books.<ref>\u041f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0431\u0438\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u044f \u0413\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0438\u044f (\u0414\u043e\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430 \u043c\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0446\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0438 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043d\u0430\u0443\u043a \u0424\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0430) \u0421\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043d\u044b, \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0438\u043b \u0423\u043b\u044f\u0445\u0438\u043d, \u041f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0446\u043a, 1994</ref>\n\nIn 1521, [[Martin Luther]] was placed under the [[Imperial ban|Ban of the Empire]], and he retired to the [[Wartburg Castle]]. During his time there, he translated the New Testament from Greek into German. It was printed in September 1522. The first complete Dutch Bible, partly based on the existing portions of Luther's translation, was printed in [[Antwerp]] in 1526 by [[Jacob van Liesvelt]].<ref>Paul Arblaster, Gergely Juh\u00e1sz, Guido Latr\u00e9 (eds) Tyndale's Testament, Brepols 2002, {{ISBN|2-503-51411-1}}, p. 120.</ref>\n\nThe first printed edition with ''[[critical apparatus]]'' (noting variant readings among the manuscripts) was produced by the printer [[Robert Estienne]] of Paris in 1550. The Greek text of this edition and of those of Erasmus became known as the ''[[Textus Receptus]]'' (Latin for \"received text\"), a name given to it in the [[House of Elzevir|Elzevier]] edition of 1633, which termed it as the text ''nunc ab omnibus receptum'' (\"now received by all\").\n\nThe use of numbered chapters and verses was not introduced until the Middle Ages and later. The system used in English was developed by Stephanus ([[Robert Estienne]] of Paris) (see [[Chapters and verses of the Bible]])\n\nLater critical editions incorporate ongoing scholarly research, including discoveries of Greek papyrus fragments from near Alexandria, Egypt, that date in some cases within a few decades of the original New Testament writings.<ref>Metzger, Bruce R. ''Manuscripts of the Greek Bible: An Introduction to Paleography'' (Oxford University Press, 1981) cf. [[Papyrus 52]].</ref> Today, most critical editions of the Greek New Testament, such as UBS4 and [[NA27]], consider the Alexandrian text-type corrected by papyri, to be the Greek text that is closest to the original ''autographs''. Their ''apparatus'' includes the result of votes among scholars, ranging from certain {A} to doubtful {E}, on which variants best preserve the original Greek text of the New Testament.\n\nCritical editions that rely primarily on the Alexandrian text-type inform nearly all modern translations (and revisions of older translations). For reasons of tradition, however, some translators prefer to use the Textus Receptus for the Greek text, or use the ''[[Majority Text]]'' which is similar to it but is a critical edition that relies on earlier manuscripts of the Byzantine text-type. Among these, some argue that the Byzantine tradition contains scribal additions, but these later interpolations preserve the orthodox interpretations of the biblical text\u2014as part of the ongoing Christian experience\u2014and in this sense are authoritative. Distrust of the textual basis of modern translations has contributed to the [[King-James-Only Movement]].\n\nThe churches of the [[Protestant Reformation]] translated the Greek of the Textus Receptus to produce [[vernacular]] Bibles, such as the German [[Luther Bible]] (1522), the Polish [[Brest Bible]] (1563), the Spanish \"Biblia del Oso\" (in English: Bible of the Bear, 1569) which later became the [[Reina-Valera]] Bible upon its first revision in 1602, the Czech [[Melantrich Bible]] (1549) and [[Bible of Kralice]] (1579-1593) and numerous English translations of the Bible. [[William Tyndale|Tyndale's]] [[Tyndale's Bible|New Testament translation]] (1526, revised in 1534, 1535 and 1536) and his translation of the [[Pentateuch]] (1530, 1534) and the [[Book of Jonah]] were met with heavy sanctions given the widespread belief that Tyndale ''changed'' the Bible as he attempted to translate it. Tyndale's unfinished work, cut short by his execution, was supplemented by [[Myles Coverdale]] and published under a pseudonym to create the [[Matthew Bible]], the first complete English translation of the Bible. Attempts at an \"authoritative\" English Bible for the [[Church of England]] would include the [[Great Bible]] of 1538 (also relying on Coverdale's work), the [[Bishops' Bible]] of 1568, and the Authorized Version (the [[King James Version]]) of 1611, the last of which would become a standard for English speaking Christians for several centuries.\n\nThe first complete French Bible was a translation by [[Jacques Lef\u00e8vre d'\u00c9taples]], published in 1530 in [[Antwerp]].<ref>Paul Arblaster, Gergely Juh\u00e1sz, Guido Latr\u00e9 (eds) Tyndale's Testament, Brepols 2002, {{ISBN|2-503-51411-1}}, pp. 134-135.</ref> The [[Froschauer Bible]] of 1531 and the [[Luther Bible]] of 1534 (both appearing in portions throughout the 1520s) were an important part of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]].\n\nThe first English translations of [[Psalms]] (1530), [[Isaiah]] (1531), [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] (1533), [[Ecclesiastes]] (1533), [[Jeremiah]] (1534) and [[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]] (1534), were executed by the Protestant Bible translator [[George Joye]] in [[Antwerp]]. In 1535 Myles Coverdale published the first complete [[Coverdale Bible|English Bible]] also in [[Antwerp]].<ref>Paul Arblaster, Gergely Juh\u00e1sz, Guido Latr\u00e9 (eds) Tyndale's Testament, Brepols 2002, {{ISBN|2-503-51411-1}}, pp. 143-145.</ref>\n\nBy 1578 both Old and New Testaments were translated to [[Slovene language|Slovene]] by the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] writer and theologian [[Jurij Dalmatin]]. The work was not printed until 1583. The [[Slovenes]] thus became the 12th nation in the world with a complete Bible in their language. The translation of the New Testament was based on the work by Dalmatin's mentor, the Protestant [[Primo\u017e Trubar]], who published the translation of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] already in 1555 and the entire testament by parts until 1577.\n\nFollowing the distribution of a Welsh New Testament and Prayer Book to every parish Church in Wales in 1567, translated by [[William Salesbury]], Welsh became the 13th language into which the whole Bible had been translated in 1588, through a translation by William Morgan, the bishop of Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant.<ref>J.

It was realised that, at the rates of Bible translation at that point, it would take until at least 2150 until Bible translation began in every language that was needing a translation. Since the launch of Vision 2025, Bible translation efforts have increased dramatically, in large part due to the technology that is now available. Due to the increase, at current rates, Bible translation will begin in every language by 2038, thus being 112 years faster.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Creson |first1=Bob |title=Bible Translation as We Approach 2025 What's Been Accomplished and What Remains |url=https://www.missionfrontiers.org/issue/article/bible-translation-as-we-approach-2025 |website=Mission Frontiers |accessdate=26 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nAs of October 2019, they estimated that around 171 million people, speak those 2,115 languages where translation work still needs to begin. In total, there are 3,969 languages without any bible translation at all, but many of these are likely to never need a Bible because they are very similar to other languages, or spoken by very few speakers.<ref>{{cite web |title=2019 Bible Translation Statistics |url=http://www.wycliffe.net/statistics. |website=Wycliffe |accessdate=26 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Differences in Bible translations ==\n[[File:Gutenberg Bible.jpg|thumb|This [[Gutenberg Bible]] is displayed by the United States [[Library of Congress]]]]\n{{Further|Dynamic and formal equivalence|Bible version debate}}\n\n===Dynamic or formal translation policy===\nA variety of linguistic, philological and ideological approaches to translation have been used. Inside the Bible-translation community, these are commonly categorized as:\n* [[Dynamic equivalence]] translation\n* [[Formal equivalence]] translation (similar to [[literal translation]])\n* [[Idiomatic]], or [[Paraphrase|paraphrastic]] translation, as used by the late [[Kenneth N. Taylor]]\n\nthough modern linguists, such as Bible scholar Dr. Joel Hoffman, disagree with this classification.<ref>[http://goddidntsaythat.com/2009/10/05/formal-equivalence-and-dynamic-equivalence-a-false-dichotom/ \"Formal Equivalence and Dynamic Equivalence: A False Dichotomy\"]</ref>\n\nAs [[Hebrew]] and [[Koine Greek|Greek]], the original languages of the Bible, like all languages, have some [[idiom]]s and concepts [[Untranslatability|not easily translated]], there is in some cases an ongoing critical tension about whether it is better to give a word for word translation or to give a translation that gives a parallel idiom in the target language. For instance, in the [[Douay Rheims Bible]], [[Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition]], [[New American Bible Revised Edition]], which are the English language [[Catholic]] translations, as well as [[Protestant]] translations like the [[King James Bible]], the [[Darby Bible]], the [[Recovery Version]], the [[New Revised Standard Version]], the [[Modern Literal Version]], and the [[New American Standard Bible]] are seen as more literal translations (or \"word for word\"), whereas translations like the [[New International Version]] and [[New Living Translation]] sometimes attempt to give relevant parallel idioms. [[The Living Bible]] and [[The Message (Bible)|The Message]] are two paraphrases of the Bible that try to convey the original meaning in contemporary language. The further away one gets from word for word translation, the easier the text becomes to read while relying more on the theological, linguistic or cultural understanding of the translator, which one would not normally expect a lay reader to require. On the other hand, as one gets closer to a word for word translation, the text becomes more literal but still relies on similar problems of meaningful translation at the word level and makes it difficult for lay readers to interpret due to their unfamiliarity with ancient idioms and other historical and cultural contexts.\n\n===Doctrinal differences and translation policy===\n {{Further|Tetragrammaton in the New Testament}}\nIn addition to linguistic concerns, theological issues also drive Bible translations. Some translations of the Bible, produced by single churches or groups of churches, may be seen as subject to a point of view by the translation committee.\n\nFor example, the [[New World Translation]], produced by [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], provides different renderings where verses in other Bible translations support the deity of Christ.<ref>http://www.jw.org/en/jehovahs-witnesses/faq/new-world-translation-accurate/#?insight[search_id]=ab273185-8135-4ee9-a212-210cef439f3e&insight[search_result_index]=0</ref> The NWT also translates ''kurios'' as \"[[Jehovah]]\" rather than \"Lord\" when quoting Hebrew passages that used YHWH. The authors believe that Jesus would have used God's name and not the customary ''kurios''. On this basis, the anonymous New World Bible Translation Committee inserted ''Jehovah'' into the New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures (New Testament) a total of 237 times while the New World Translation of the Hebrew Scriptures (Old Testament) uses Jehovah a total of 6,979 times to a grand total of 7,216 in the entire 2013 Revision New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures while previous revisions such as the 1984 revision were a total of 7,210 times while the 1961 revision were a total of 7,199 times.<ref>''New World Translation'' appendix, pp. 1564-1566. When discussing \u201cRestoring the Divine Name,\u201d the New World Bible Translation Committee states: \u201cTo know where the divine name was replaced by the Greek words \u039a\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 and \u0398\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2, we have determined where the inspired Christian writers have quoted verses, passages and expressions from the Hebrew Scriptures and then we have referred back to the Hebrew text to ascertain whether the divine name appears there. In this way we determined the identity to give Ky\u02b9ri\u00b7os and The\u00b7os\u02b9 and the personality with which to clothe them.\u201d Explaining further, the Committee said: \u201cTo avoid overstepping the bounds of a translator into the field of exegesis, we have been most cautious about rendering the divine name in the Christian Greek Scriptures, always carefully considering the Hebrew Scriptures as a background. We have looked for agreement from the Hebrew versions to confirm our rendering.\u201d Such agreement from Hebrew versions exists in all the 237 places that the New World Bible Translation Committee has rendered the divine name in the body of its translation.\u2014NW appendix, pp. 1564-1566</ref>\n\nA number of [[Sacred Name Bibles]] (e.g., the [[Sacred Scriptures Bethel Edition]]) have been published that are even more rigorous in transliterating the tetragrammaton using Semitic forms to translate it in the Old Testament and also using the same Semitic forms to translate the Greek word ''Theos'' (God) in the New Testament\u2014usually Yahweh, Elohim or some other variation.\n\nOther translations are distinguished by smaller but distinctive doctrinal differences. For example, the [[Purified Translation of the Bible]], by translation and explanatory footnotes, promoting the position that Christians should not drink alcohol, that New Testament references to \"wine\" are translated as \"grape juice\".\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Bible}}\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n; Ancient and classical translations&#x3a;\n* [[Coptic versions of the Bible]]\n* [[Syriac versions of the Bible]]\n* [[Targum]] and [[Peshitta]] (Aramaic)\n* [[Vetus Latina]] and [[Vulgate]] (Latin)\n\n;English translations&#x3a;\n* [[Early Modern English Bible translations]]\n* [[English translations of the Bible]]\n* [[Jewish English Bible translations]]\n* [[Old English Bible translations]]\n* [[Middle English Bible translations]]\n* [[Modern English Bible translations]]\n\n; Other languages&#x3a;\n* [[Bible translations by language]]\n* [[Naro Bible]]\n* [[Bible translations into Ladakhi]]\n* [[Bible translations into the languages of Africa]]\n* [[Bible translations into the languages of India]]\n* [[Bible translations into the languages of Indonesia]]\n\n;Difficulties&#x3a;\n* [[Gender in Bible translation]]\n* [[Texas sharpshooter fallacy#Translation and interpretation]]\n* [[Translation#Fidelity and transparency]]\n\n;Others&#x3a;\n* [[Bibledit]]\n* [[Bible version debate]]\n* [[Byzantine text-type]]\n* [[Bible concordance]]\n* [[Exegesis]]\n* [[Hermeneutics]]\n* [[Institute for Bible Translation]]\n* [[List of languages by year of first Bible translation]]\n* [[Skopos theory]]\n* [[Textus Receptus]]\n* [[Textual variants in the New Testament]]\n* [[Translation]]\n}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Garry Wills|Wills, Garry]], \"A Wild and Indecent Book\" (review of [[David Bentley Hart]], ''The New Testament:  A Translation'', [[Yale University Press]], 577 pp.), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol.

Playing a critical role in Illinois healthcare, UIC operates the state's major public medical center and serves as the principal educator of Illinois\u2019 physicians, dentists, pharmacists, nurses and other healthcare professionals. The [[University of Illinois Hospital & Health Sciences System]] (a.k.a. \"UI Health\"), which includes the hospital, clinics, and health science colleges, is a part of UIC.\n\nThe modern UIC was formed in 1982 by the consolidation of two U. of I. campuses: the Medical Center campus, which dates back to the 19th century; and the comprehensive Chicago Circle campus, which in 1965 replaced the two-year undergraduate [[Navy Pier]] campus designated to educate returning veterans.\n\n===Springfield===\n{{Main|University of Illinois at Springfield}}\n[[File:X Picnic 181.jpg|thumb|University of Illinois Springfield campus]]\nThe newest university in the system is [[University of Illinois at Springfield]].

When it opened in 1969, it was named '''Sangamon State University''', and was exclusively an upper-level university, serving only upperclassmen and graduate students. In 1995, Sangamon State was joined to the University of Illinois System and renamed as the University of Illinois at Springfield. The University of Illinois System then transitioned the school from an upper division university into a full four-year institution with an undergraduate program.\n\nUIS is the smallest university in the University of Illinois system, with an enrollment of nearly 5,000 students. UIS offers more than 50 degree-granting programs. The academic curriculum of the campus emphasizes a strong liberal arts core, an array of professional programs, extensive opportunities in experiential education, and a broad engagement in public affairs issues in its academic and community service pursuits.

The [[University of Illinois Hospital & Health Sciences System]] (a.k.a. \"UI Health\"), which includes the hospital, clinics, and health science colleges, is a part of UIC.\n\nThe modern UIC was formed in 1982 by the consolidation of two U. of I. campuses: the Medical Center campus, which dates back to the 19th century; and the comprehensive Chicago Circle campus, which in 1965 replaced the two-year undergraduate [[Navy Pier]] campus designated to educate returning veterans.\n\n===Springfield===\n{{Main|University of Illinois at Springfield}}\n[[File:X Picnic 181.jpg|thumb|University of Illinois Springfield campus]]\nThe newest university in the system is [[University of Illinois at Springfield]]. It is located in [[Springfield, Illinois]], the state [[Capital (political)|capital]] of [[Illinois]]. When it opened in 1969, it was named '''Sangamon State University''', and was exclusively an upper-level university, serving only upperclassmen and graduate students. In 1995, Sangamon State was joined to the University of Illinois System and renamed as the University of Illinois at Springfield. The University of Illinois System then transitioned the school from an upper division university into a full four-year institution with an undergraduate program.\n\nUIS is the smallest university in the University of Illinois system, with an enrollment of nearly 5,000 students. UIS offers more than 50 degree-granting programs. The academic curriculum of the campus emphasizes a strong liberal arts core, an array of professional programs, extensive opportunities in experiential education, and a broad engagement in public affairs issues in its academic and community service pursuits. UIS has the lowest student/teacher ratio of all three campuses of the U of I System.\n\n===Urbana\u2013Champaign===\n{{Main|University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign}}\n[[File:Altgeld-back.jpg|thumb|Altgeld Hall on the Urbana campus]]\n[[File:IllinoisQuad.jpg|thumb|Illini Union on the Urbana campus]]\nThe [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign|Urbana\u2013Champaign campus]] was founded in 1867 as the Illinois Industrial University.

The University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign is the largest and most prestigious of the three campuses. UIUC, or more commonly \"ILLINOIS,\" is the flagship state university campus. It is home to 16 colleges and instructional units including the College of Agricultural, Consumer, and Environmental Sciences; College of Applied Health Sciences; Gies College of Business; College of Education; College of Engineering; College of Fine and Applied Arts; Graduate College; Institute of Labor and Industrial Relations; College of Law; College of Liberal Arts and Sciences; Graduate School of Library and Information Science; College of Media; Carle-Illinois College of Medicine; School of Social Work; and the College of Veterinary Medicine.\n\nIt is also home to the National Center for Supercomputing Applications, [[National Center for Supercomputing Applications|NCSA]], where [[Marc Andreessen]] (of [[Netscape Communications Corporation|Netscape]] fame) and others helped develop the [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic]] web browser, the first [[HTML]] browser capable of rendering images. In addition, in 1987, NCSA created [[NCSA Telnet]], a program which permitted users access to the supercomputer's resources remotely. The petascale [[Blue Waters]] to be completed in 2011 is among the world's fastest supercomputers.\n\n[[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign|UIUC]] and its alumni are particularly well known for their contributions to engineering, including inventions such as the [[LED]], [[plasma screen]], and [[integrated circuit]].

Yanbian is bordered to the north by [[Heilongjiang]], on the west by [[Baishan]] and [[Jilin City]], on the south by [[North Korea]]'s [[North Hamgyong]] Province, and on the east by [[Primorsky Krai]] in [[Russia]]. Yanbian is designated as a Korean autonomous prefecture due to the large number of [[Koreans in China|ethnic Koreans]] living in the region. The prefectural capital is [[Yanji]], and the mya\nJeonghyo]].\n\n== History ==\n{{More citations needed|date=April 2007}}\n\nIn the [[Ming Dynasty]], Yanbian was governed by the Jianzhou Guard ({{lang|zh-hant|\u5efa\u5dde\u885b}}), and in the late [[Qing Dynasty]] the area was divided into the Yanji ({{lang|zh-hant|\u5ef6\u5409\u5ef3}}) and Hunchun ({{lang|zh-hant|\u743f\u6625\u5ef3}}) [[subprefecture]]s. From 1644 to the 1800s the [[Manchurian people|Manchurian]] administrators of the Qing state attempted to separate northeast China, politically and ethnographically, into a \"Manchuria\" to which they could retreat in case an ethnically [[Han Chinese]] dynasty regained control over China. However, this effort failed because of the trading and agricultural opportunities available to Han Chinese migrants in the northeast region which made it profitable to evade the rules, as well as later Qing relaxation of the same rules to discourage [[Empire of Russia|Russian]] encroachment.\n\nIn the 19th century, Korean immigrants migrated en masse from the [[Korean peninsula]] to China. After the foundation of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]], a second wave arrived. Of the 2 million ethnic Koreans in Manchuria at the time of the communist takeover, 1.2 million remained in the region after the end of [[World War II]]. Many participated in the [[Chinese Civil War]], most on the side of the Chinese communists. When the civil war was over, the new Chinese government gave these Koreans their own autonomous region ({{lang|zh-hans|\u533a}}) in 1952. Yanbian was upgraded to an ethnic autonomous prefecture in 1955.\n\nKorean (Joseon) migration into northeast China began in significant numbers in the last quarter of the 19th century and was mainly motivated by economic hardship on the Korean side of the border. After the Japanese annexed Korea in 1910, a small but significant number of migrants also came to Manchuria for political reasons.<ref>Pyong, Gap Min. \"A Comparison of the Korean Minorities in China and Japan.\" International Migration Review, Vol. 26, No. 1. (Spring, 1992), pp. 4-21.</ref>\n\nIn 1952, the Korean migrants comprised some 60% of the local population, but by 2000 that was down to 32%. The Chinese authorities subsidize Korean language schools and publications, but also take measures to prevent an emergence of Korean [[irredentism]] in the area. From the late 1990s, the Koreans have assimilated into mainstream Chinese culture with increasing speed, often switching to daily use of Chinese and choosing to attend Chinese-language schools.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/IH16Ad01.html |title = The gentle decline of the 'Third Korea'   |publisher = [[Asia Times]] |date = 2007-08-16 |accessdate = 2007-08-17 |author = Andrei Lankov }}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\n\n*[[Geographic coordinate]]s: 41\u00b0 59' 47\" - 44\u00b0 30' 42\" N, 127\u00b0 27' 43\" - 131\u00b0 18' 33\" E\n* Total border length: {{convert|755.2|km}}\n** With North Korea: {{convert|522.5|km}}\n** With Russia: {{convert|232.7|km}}\n\nMountains that are in the prefecture are:\n\n*[[Changbai Mountains]] (central range)\n* Zhangguangcai Peak ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5f20\u5e7f\u624d\u5cad}})\n* Harba Peak ({{lang|zh-hans|\u54c8\u5c14\u5df4\u5cad}})\n* Peony Peak ({{lang|zh-hans|\u7261\u4e39\u9886}})\n* Old Master Peak ({{lang|zh-hans|\u8001\u7237\u5cad}})\n* Nangang Mountain Range ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5357\u5c97\u5c71\u8109}})\n\nThere have been over 40 types of [[mineral]]s and 50 kinds of metals \u2013 including [[gold]], [[lead]], [[zinc]], [[copper]], [[silver]], [[manganese]] and [[mercury (element)|mercury]] \u2013 discovered near or in the mountains.\n\nThe average land height is 500 metres above [[sea level]].\n\nMain rivers include:\n\n*[[Songhua River]]\n*[[Mudan River]] (Peony River)\n*[[Tumen River]]\n**[[Gaya River]] (branch of the Tumen)\n**[[Hunchun River]]\n\nThe rivers sustain 28 running water processing facilities.

Yanbian is bordered to the north by [[Heilongjiang]], on the west by [[Baishan]] and [[Jilin City]], on the south by [[North Korea]]'s [[North Hamgyong]] Province, and on the east by [[Primorsky Krai]] in [[Russia]]. Yanbian is designated as a Korean autonomous prefecture due to the large number of [[Koreans in China|ethnic Koreans]] living in the region. The prefectural capital is [[Yanji]], and the total area is {{convert|42,700|km2|sigfig=3}}.\n\nThe prefecture has an important [[Balhae]] archaeological site: the [[Ancient Tombs at Longtou Mountain]], which includes the [[Mausoleum of Princess Jeonghyo]].\n\n== History ==\n{{More citations needed|date=April 2007}}\n\nIn the [[Ming Dynasty]], Yanbian was governed by the Jianzhou Guard ({{lang|zh-hant|\u5efa\u5dde\u885b}}), and in the late [[Qing Dynasty]] the area was divided into the Yanji ({{lang|zh-hant|\u5ef6\u5409\u5ef3}}) and Hunchun ({{lang|zh-hant|\u743f\u6625\u5ef3}}) [[subprefecture]]s. From 1644 to the 1800s the [[Manchurian people|Manchurian]] administrators of the Qing state attempted to separate northeast China, politically and ethnographically, into a \"Manchuria\" to which they could retreat in case an ethnically [[Han Chinese]] dynasty regained control over China. However, this effort failed because of the trading and agricultural opportunities available to Han Chinese migrants in the northeast region which made it profitable to evade the rules, as well as later Qing relaxation of the same rules to discourage [[Empire of Russia|Russian]] encroachment.\n\nIn the 19th century, Korean immigrants migrated en masse from the [[Korean peninsula]] to China. After the foundation of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]], a second wave arrived. Of the 2 million ethnic Koreans in Manchuria at the time of the communist takeover, 1.2 million remained in the region after the end of [[World War II]]. Many participated in the [[Chinese Civil War]], most on the side of the Chinese communists. When the civil war was over, the new Chinese government gave these Koreans their own autonomous region ({{lang|zh-hans|\u533a}}) in 1952. Yanbian was upgraded to an ethnic autonomous prefecture in 1955.\n\nKorean (Joseon) migration into northeast China began in significant numbers in the last quarter of the 19th century and was mainly motivated by economic hardship on the Korean side of the border. After the Japanese annexed Korea in 1910, a small but significant number of migrants also came to Manchuria for political reasons.<ref>Pyong, Gap Min. \"A Comparison of the Korean Minorities in China and Japan.\" International Migration Review, Vol. 26, No. 1. (Spring, 1992), pp. 4-21.</ref>\n\nIn 1952, the Korean migrants comprised some 60% of the local population, but by 2000 that was down to 32%. The Chinese authorities subsidize Korean language schools and publications, but also take measures to prevent an emergence of Korean [[irredentism]] in the area. From the late 1990s, the Koreans have assimilated into mainstream Chinese culture with increasing speed, often switching to daily use of Chinese and choosing to attend Chinese-language schools.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/IH16Ad01.html |title = The gentle decline of the 'Third Korea'   |publisher = [[Asia Times]] |date = 2007-08-16 |accessdate = 2007-08-17 |author = Andrei Lankov }}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\n\n*[[Geographic coordinate]]s: 41\u00b0 59' 47\" - 44\u00b0 30' 42\" N, 127\u00b0 27' 43\" - 131\u00b0 18' 33\" E\n* Total border length: {{convert|755.2|km}}\n** With North Korea: {{convert|522.5|km}}\n** With Russia: {{convert|232.7|km}}\n\nMountains that are in the prefecture are:\n\n*[[Changbai Mountains]] (central range)\n* Zhangguangcai Peak ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5f20\u5e7f\u624d\u5cad}})\n* Harba Peak ({{lang|zh-hans|\u54c8\u5c14\u5df4\u5cad}})\n* Peony Peak ({{lang|zh-hans|\u7261\u4e39\u9886}})\n* Old Master Peak ({{lang|zh-hans|\u8001\u7237\u5cad}})\n* Nangang Mountain Range ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5357\u5c97\u5c71\u8109}})\n\nThere have been over 40 types of [[mineral]]s and 50 kinds of metals \u2013 including [[gold]], [[lead]], [[zinc]], [[copper]], [[silver]], [[manganese]] and [[mercury (element)|mercury]] \u2013 discovered near or in the mountains.\n\nThe average land height is 500 metres above [[sea level]].\n\nMain rivers include:\n\n*[[Songhua River]]\n*[[Mudan River]] (Peony River)\n*[[Tumen River]]\n**[[Gaya River]] (branch of the Tumen)\n**[[Hunchun River]]\n\nThe rivers sustain 28 running water processing facilities.

Victoria divorced him, and he then moved in with Nina and her son, [[Chance Chancellor|Phillip Chancellor IV]] ([[Thomas Dekker (actor)|Thomas Dekker]]), and he later married Nina out of obligation. He eventually developed genuine feelings for Nina, however, she fell in love with novelist [[Cole Howard]] ([[J. Eddie Peck]]).

Nina then tried to commit suicide and shot herself in a struggle with Ryan, and he was arrested for her shooting. Nina suffered short term amnesia, and although she regained her memory and exonerated Ryan, they divorced. Ryan then ended up marrying Tricia, much to the disapproval of her father Keith Dennison (David Allen Brooks). However, Tricia was very jealous of Ryan's relationship with Phillip, who accused her of breaking apart his family. In desperation, Tricia stopped taking her birth control pills and they conceived a child, to which Ryan was against though warmed up to the idea. When she miscarried, Tricia saw it as her punishment for deceiving her husband.\n\nTricia then became obsessed with destroying her sister [[Megan Dennison]]'s ([[Ashley Jones]]) relationship with [[Tony Viscardi]] ([[Nick Scotti]]). She ran down Tony in Megan's driveway, in which it was suspected Tricia did intentionally. Eventually, all the Dennisons left town including Tricia, who left Ryan to move to [[London, England]].

Tricia turned to Carter Mills, who was really rapist [[The Young and the Restless characters (1990s)#Matt Clark|Matt Clark]] ([[Rick Hearst]]).

Victor broke Victoria free, who entered the chapel where Tricia shot twice at her, but Ryan jumped in front to save her life. Eventually, Ryan died from the gunshot wounds, leaving Victoria devastated and alone. Shortly after, Ryan appeared to Victoria in a dream where they said their vows, and she awoke with a ring on her finger.\n\n==Reception==\nA syndicated article that appeared in ''The Fort Oglethorpe Press'' described Ryan's attempts to seduce Victoria as \"a path that's fraught with peril and which forces the good-natured actor to search hard for inspiration\".<ref name=\"TFOP\">{{cite news|title=Laid-back lad loathsome as a lout |work = The Fort Oglethorpe Press |date=November 13, 1991 |page=6 |accessdate = April 6, 2013 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=392&dat=19911113&id=lv9LAAAAIBAJ&sjid=SD8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=6273,1051408}}</ref> Over his duration on ''The Young and the Restless'', Reeves became popular with fans, and his performance was met with acclaim from his peers.

The two fell in love and married to Victor's dismay, however, Victoria refused to consummate their relationship and Ryan cheated on her with Nina Webster. Victoria divorced him, and he then moved in with Nina and her son, [[Chance Chancellor|Phillip Chancellor IV]] ([[Thomas Dekker (actor)|Thomas Dekker]]), and he later married Nina out of obligation. He eventually developed genuine feelings for Nina, however, she fell in love with novelist [[Cole Howard]] ([[J. Eddie Peck]]). After Nina was rejected by him, she had a nervous breakdown causing Ryan to sleep with [[Tricia Dennison]] ([[Sabryn Genet]]). Nina then tried to commit suicide and shot herself in a struggle with Ryan, and he was arrested for her shooting. Nina suffered short term amnesia, and although she regained her memory and exonerated Ryan, they divorced. Ryan then ended up marrying Tricia, much to the disapproval of her father Keith Dennison (David Allen Brooks). However, Tricia was very jealous of Ryan's relationship with Phillip, who accused her of breaking apart his family. In desperation, Tricia stopped taking her birth control pills and they conceived a child, to which Ryan was against though warmed up to the idea. When she miscarried, Tricia saw it as her punishment for deceiving her husband.\n\nTricia then became obsessed with destroying her sister [[Megan Dennison]]'s ([[Ashley Jones]]) relationship with [[Tony Viscardi]] ([[Nick Scotti]]). She ran down Tony in Megan's driveway, in which it was suspected Tricia did intentionally. Eventually, all the Dennisons left town including Tricia, who left Ryan to move to [[London, England]]. Six months later, Tricia returned to Genoa City and asked Ryan to take her back, in which he refused as Victoria became interested in him again. Tricia turned to Carter Mills, who was really rapist [[The Young and the Restless characters (1990s)#Matt Clark|Matt Clark]] ([[Rick Hearst]]). He used her, leading Tricia to attempt suicide but Ryan was able to stop her. After Ryan and Victoria reunited, Victor had Tricia move in with him to keep her away from them. They decided to get remarried, and on their wedding day, Tricia arrived in wedding dress identical to Victoria's, locked her in a closet and took her place at the altar, where she held Ryan at gunpoint to remarry her. Victor broke Victoria free, who entered the chapel where Tricia shot twice at her, but Ryan jumped in front to save her life. Eventually, Ryan died from the gunshot wounds, leaving Victoria devastated and alone.

St. David's was a self-governing college of the University of Wales, but in 2010 it merged with [[Trinity University College]] (under its 1822 charter) to create the [[University of Wales Trinity Saint David]].<ref name=\"news.bbc.co.uk\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-west-wales-10723064 |title=BBC News College merger sealed by royal charter |publisher=BBC News |date=22 July 2010 |accessdate=22 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe university was founded as '''St David's College''' (''Coleg Dewi Sant''), becoming '''St David's University College''' (''Coleg Prifysgol Dewi Sant'') in 1971, when it became part of the federal [[University of Wales]]. With fewer than 2,000 students on campus, it is often claimed to be one of the smallest [[public university|public universities]] in Europe.\n\n==History==\nWhen [[Thomas Burgess (bishop)|Thomas Burgess]] was appointed [[Bishop of St David's]] in 1803, he saw a need for a college in which Welsh [[ordination|ordinands]] could receive a higher education. The existing colleges at Oxford and Cambridge were out of the geographical and financial means of most would-be students.\n\nBurgess had no Welsh connections; he was born in Odiham, Hampshire in 1756. After education at [[Winchester]] and [[Oxford]], he had short stays in [[Salisbury]] and [[Durham, England|Durham]] before being appointed to his first bishopric in Wales in 1803. Burgess intended to build his new college to train priests in [[Llanddewi Brefi]] which, at the time, was similar in size to Lampeter but ten kilometres from it and with an honoured place in the Christian history of Wales. When Burgess was staying with his friend the Bishop of [[Gloucester]] in 1820, however, he met [[John Scandrett Harford]], a wealthy landowner from [[Gloucestershire]].  Harford donated the three acre (12,000 m\u00b2) Castle Field site in Lampeter, named after the [[Norman architecture|Norman]] [[castle]] once contained in the field. This is the site on which the present University stands.\n\n[[File:Burgess39694.JPG|thumb|right|Engraving of Bishop Burgess]]\n[[File:View of St. David's College.jpeg|thumb|View of St. David's College c.1835]]\n'''St David's College''' was thus founded just outside Lampeter; the foundation stone was laid in 1822. Burgess left St. David's in 1825 to become [[Bishop of Salisbury]] but work on the college continued, largely supervised by Harford. The \u00a316,000 required to erect the college had been raised from public donations, a government grant and highly publicised gifts, including one from [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV]]. The main college building was completed in 1827 and the college officially opened on [[St. David's Day]] of that year, welcoming its first 26 students. As such, it was the oldest institution of higher education in Wales, and the third oldest in [[England and Wales]], receiving its first charter in 1828. In 1852, the college gained the right to award the degree of [[Bachelor of Divinity]] (BD) and, in 1865, the degree of Bachelor of Arts (BA), long before the other colleges in Wales gained their own degree awarding powers. As early as 1865, when a campaign had commenced to establish a University for Wales, there were suggestions that the College should take on this function. However, they were opposed by those who believed it should retain its original purpose as a theological college.<ref name=\"W 24-2-65 edit\">{{cite news |title=Editorial [untitled] |url=https://newspapers.library.wales/view/4352954/4352960/31 |accessdate=13 December 2018 |newspaper=Welshman |date=24 February 1865 |pages=4\u20135}}</ref>\n\nAlthough it continued as a centre of clergy training until 1978, there was always a proportion of students who did not intend to be ordained. The 1896 charter specifically stated that the college could accept anyone, regardless of whether they intended to take Holy Orders. Since 1925, it had been possible to study for a BA at the college without studying any theology at all. However, throughout the college's history, non-ordinands had been in a minority. In the 1950s the number of ordinands declined sharply and the College faced possible closure unless it could secure government funding. Principal [[John Roland Lloyd Thomas|J.R. Lloyd Thomas]] did not spare himself in the fight for survival and, in 1960, after much negotiation, [[Cardiff University|University College, Cardiff]], agreed to sponsor Saint David's. Thus the government finally began to assist SDC financially.\n\nIn 1971, the college became a member of the federal University of Wales and suspended its own degree-awarding powers. It became '''St David's University College''' (SDUC). By this time, the college had begun shifting its specialisms and, whilst theology continued to be a strong point, students could choose from a much wider range of [[liberal arts]] subjects. In 1996, the Privy Council\u2014in response to a petition from the University\u2014agreed to change its title again to the '''University of Wales, Lampeter''' in line with moves elsewhere in the University and the recognition of its growth and changing status. In September 2007, the University of Wales become confederal rather than federal in nature, effectively giving Lampeter independent university status. Unlike other former Wales colleges however, the institution's name remained unchanged.\n\nThe university specialised in Theology, [[Religious Studies]], philosophy, [[Classics]], [[Anthropology]], [[Archaeology]], [[English studies|English]] and History.  Prior to the merger, the university was also growing in disciplines from the [[liberal arts]] and [[social sciences]] such as Film and Media Studies, Information Society Studies, Business Management, Chinese Studies and Voluntary Sector Studies.  However, in the last two decades several other departments which taught subjects in their own right closed, notably French, German and [[Geography]].\n\nThe university had research and consultancy departments, including the Centre for Beliefs and Values, Centre for Enterprise, European and Extension Services, Archaeological Services and the Centre for the Study of Religion in Celtic Societies.\n\nIn the early 1990s, there also existed an influential [[Human geography]] department at the college. This was closed in 2001 but the [[diaspora]] of the Lampeter Geography School continue to have an influence on their field.\n\nIn 2008, the [[Quality Assurance Agency]] concluded that, although the quality of Lampeter's degrees was satisfactory, they had 'limited confidence' in the institution's quality assurance procedures and systems.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.qaa.ac.uk/reviews/reports/institutional/UoWLampeter/summary.asp |title=Institutional review \u2013 University of Wales, Lampeter |publisher=Qaa.ac.uk |date=25 May 2007 |accessdate=2 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325051824/http://www.qaa.ac.uk/reviews/reports/institutional/UoWLampeter/summary.asp |archive-date=25 March 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Further to this assessment, the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales commissioned a further report which found \"very real problems of leadership and management\" at the university.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lamp.ac.uk/news/press_releases/2008/new-university.html |title=Press Release: A New University in Wales? |publisher=Lamp.ac.uk |date=11 December 2008 |accessdate=2 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611223807/http://www.lamp.ac.uk/news/press_releases/2008/new-university.html |archivedate=11 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"independent1\">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher/is-a-merger-the-only-way-to-save-lampeter-1625432.html |title=Is a merger the only way to save Lampeter? \u2013 Higher, Education |work=The Independent |date= 19 February 2009|accessdate=2 May 2010 | location=London | first=Lucy | last=Hodges}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=404812 |title=Trinity College Carmarthen \u2013 Talks start on new university |work=Times Higher Education |date=1 January 2009 |accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref> As a direct result, on 14 December 2008, the university announced that it was in merger talks with [[Trinity College, Carmarthen]] with the intention of forming a new university in Wales.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trinitysaintdavid.ac.uk/en/news/new-university.asp|title=University of Wales Trinity Saint David \u2013 Error 404: Page not found|publisher=Trinitysaintdavid.ac.uk|accessdate=18 November 2014}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In July 2010, it was announced that the Queen had approved an order granting a supplemental charter to Lampeter which would create the new [[University of Wales, Trinity Saint David]] and which would accept its first students in September 2010<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trinitysaintdavid.ac.uk/en/news/uwtsd.asp|title=University of Wales Trinity Saint David \u2013 Error 404: Page not found|publisher=Trinitysaintdavid.ac.uk|accessdate=18 November 2014}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> at which time the University of Wales, Lampeter would formally cease to exist.\n\n== University buildings ==\n=== The Old College ===\n[[File:Uwlsdb.jpg|thumb|right|The St David's Building at the University of Wales, Lampeter]]\n[[C.R. Cockerell]] designed the original college, now called the Saint David's Building (Old Building or OB by students) in the centre of the Campus. It is a [[Grade II* listed building]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-10431-st-david-s-university-college-original-bu#.VorCWE9_cnM |title= St.david's University College (Original Buildings) College Street, Lampeter Date Listed: 21 September 1964 Cadw Building ID: 10431| publisher= Britisn Listed Buildings|accessdate= 4 January 2016}}</ref> and contains lecture rooms, common rooms, administrative offices, student residential accommodation and the following three main areas:\n\n'''The Old Hall''' was the refectory until the Lloyd Thomas Building came into use in 1969. It fell into disuse; however after much restoration, it re-opened in 1991 as one of the main public rooms for meetings, dinners, conferences and for use by outside organisations. It was also used for some examinations.\n\nThe Old Hall also contains paintings of various principals, presidents, benefactors, vice-chancellors ''et al.'' including Bishop Burgess, [[Maurice Jones]], [[Thomas Price (Carnhuanawc)|Thomas Price]],  [[Llewelyn Lewellin]], [[Edward Harold Browne]], [[Keith Robbins]] and [[Brian Morris, Baron Morris of Castle Morris|Brian Robert Morris]].\n\n'''St David's Chapel''' was consecrated in 1827. In 1879, it was rebuilt according to the specifications of the architect [[Thomas Graham Jackson]] of Cambridge. It re-opened on 24 June 1880. It was then refurbished again during the 1930s, mainly through the provision of a new [[reredos]] in 1933 and a major overhaul of the organ in 1934. The chapel was provided with a dedicated chaplain and services were held on Sundays and throughout the week as well as on saints' days and major festivals.\n\n'''The Founders' Library''' housed the main library until the new library opened in 1966. After this time the library housed the University's oldest printed books (1470\u20131850) and manuscripts (the earliest from the thirteenth century), given to Lampeter from 1822 onwards, as well as the archives of the university. It is a priceless collection unique to Lampeter. Named after its founders{{spaced endash}}Thomas Burgess (1756\u20131837), [[Thomas Bowdler]] (1754\u20131825), and [[Thomas Phillips (educational benefactor)|Thomas Phillips]] (1760\u20131851){{spaced endash}}it served as a resource for research and teaching, particularly in English, History and Mediaeval Studies. In 2005, it was announced that a new \u00a3700,000 library building was to be built on campus to house the university's special collections, as the Founders' Library was not environmentally suitable for such valuable documents. This extension to the main library was completed in 2008.\n\n=== Later additions ===\n[[File:Cantuwl.jpg|thumb|right|The Original Canterbury Building]]\n\n'''The Canterbury Building''' was built to house a growing number of students at the end of the 19th century. The foundation stone was laid by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] in 1885 and the building was officially opened on 24 June 1887. It contained a physical science laboratory, two lecture rooms and new accommodation. However, structural problems forced the university to demolish the original building in the summer of 1971. The second Canterbury Building was opened on 20 October 1973 by the Vice-Chancellor of the [[University of Kent]]. It was demolished, and replaced with the present Canterbury Building, during the 2012\u201313 academic year.\n\n'''The Main Library''' was opened on 7 July 1966 by the then Chancellor of the University of Wales, the [[Duke of Edinburgh]]. It was extended and then reopened by the [[Prince of Wales]] on 21 June 1984.\n\n'''The Arts Building''' was opened by The Rt. Hon [[Peter Thomas, Baron Thomas of Gwydir|Peter Thomas]], [[Secretary of State for Wales]] on 4 October 1971, in time for it to house the new [[Geography]] department. The [[Archaeology]] and [[Anthropology]] department has since moved into the ground floor of the building, the first floor being shared by the Department of Film and Media and the Department of Management and I.T. The building now houses the new combined A.H.A ([[Archaeology]], History and [[Anthropology]]) department.\n\n'''The Cliff Tucker Theatre''', on the banks of the River Dulas, was opened by Sir [[Anthony Hopkins]] in 1996 and contained teaching rooms, lecture theatres and a large computer room. It was named in honour of [[Cliff Tucker]], a former student and benefactor of the university.\n\n'''The Sheikh Khalifa Building''', completed in 1997 and named after Sheikh [[Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan]], a benefactor of the university, was the home of the Department of Theology, Religious Studies and Islamic Studies, one of the largest departments of its kind in the United Kingdom. It was opened by Professor Sir [[Stewart Sutherland, Baron Sutherland of Houndwood|Stewart Sutherland]]. Behind the departmental building is a small mosque, used by Islamic students and residents of the town.\n\n'''The Roderic Bowen Research Centre''', completed 2007 and named after [[Roderic Bowen]], a former president of the university, houses the Founders' Library collection and archives and adjoins the main library building. The centre was opened on 17 October 2008, by [[First Minister for Wales]], [[Rhodri Morgan]].\n\n'''The Confucius Institute''' opened in 2007, as the home of the University's department of Chinese Studies and had direct links to Chinese Cultural institutes.\n\n'''Archaeology Laboratories''' provided facilities for environmental archaeology, osteoarchaeology, soil studies and conservation.\n\n'''The Lloyd Thomas Refectory''' was the university's main dining hall, providing meals to guests and catered students and a regular Sunday carvery.\n\n'''The Media centre''' contained studios and recording facilities.\n\n'''Bishop Burgess Hall''' formerly housed the departments of Classics and Philosophy. In 2009 it was converted to become a hub for student services.\n\n== Academic dress ==\n[[File:Lampeter BA.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A modern reproduction of the original Lampeter BA hood]]\nFrom 1971, Lampeter awarded University of Wales degrees, and as such, the [[academic dress]] was that of the [[Academic dress of the University of Wales|University of Wales]] \u2013 graduates wore a black stuff gown, with bell sleeves for bachelors, and glove sleeve for masters. Hoods were lined with mazarin blue shot green (arts), mazarin blue shot red (divinity), lined yellow shot black (MSc) and yellow shot red, bound light blue (MBA).\n\nThe Lampeter academic dress for the degrees it awarded in its own right differed from this as follows:\n\n'''Undergraduates''' wore a black stuff gown, with bell-sleeves, with the whole sleeve split open in front. The year-round wearing of undergraduate academic dress ended in 1971 when Lampeter joined the University of Wales. However around 2006\u201310 there was some support for a resurrection of this tradition by current students.\n\n'''[[Bachelor of Divinity]]'''. A black gown, of MA pattern (long closed sleeves), with a double crescent cut at the end of each sleeve. A black silk hood, lined with dark violet silk, and bound with 1\" white silk. Originally, it could be made in either the Oxford or the Cambridge shape, but Cambridge became the norm.\n\n'''Bachelor of Arts'''. A black stuff gown of Cambridge BA pattern. A black silk hood, part-lined and bound with 'miniver' \u2013 white fur with black spots. (Rabbit was usually used, with 'stick-on' spots, on account of the cost of real miniver!). As with the BD, it could be made in either the Oxford or the Cambridge shape, but Cambridge became the norm.\n\nThere was also a two-year course for those who could not afford the full three-year one. From 1884, this was called the '''Licence in Divinity''' (LD). Holders wore the undergraduate gown, with a black stuff hood, lined with black stuff, and bound for 1\" with white silk. This was always Cambridge shape. The LD was not awarded after about 1940 and, in 1969, the hood was used for the DipTh, which was awarded until the College ceased clergy training in 1978. A degree with a similar title was introduced in 2007, the '''Licence in Divinity (Doctoral)''' (LicDD). This however, is a postdoctoral degree in theology or religious studies, the first of its kind in the UK. The academicals prescribed to this degree is non-conventional in that it consists of a scarlet [[mozzetta]] trimmed with white fur that is worn over the festal gown and under the hood (of the relevant Wales degree) and worn with a scarlet bonnet with gold cord and tassel. The degree was only awarded for a brief time before it was dropped.\n\nThe University awarded a number of '''Licences''' in Theology (LTh), Religious Studies (LRS), Islamic Studies, Latin, and Classical Greek.\n\n== Sports ==\nThe university has a sports hall with [[badminton]] and [[squash (sport)|squash]] courts, and a multigym with [[weight training]] equipment. For outdoor sports, the University has tennis courts, a [[cricket]] field and facilities for football, hockey and rugby. The college cricket pavilion, opened officially on 1 May 1909 is now a [[listed building]].\n\nLampeter has active [[netball]], [[field hockey]], [[association football|football]] and [[rugby union]] teams, all of which played in the college colours of [[Flag of Saint David|black and gold]].\n\n=== Rugby ===\nRugby was introduced to Lampeter by Vice-Principal [[Rowland Williams (theologian)|Rowland Williams]] around 1850 and, as such, the college can claim to have the oldest [[Rugby football]] team in Wales. Despite some debate as to whether this honour belongs to the town team or the University side, the Welsh Rugby Union's official history \"Fields of Praise: The Official History of the Welsh Rugby Union, 1881\u20131981\"<ref>Fields of Praise, The Official History of the Welsh Rugby Union 1881\u20131981 pp259, David Smith, Gareth Williams (1980)</ref> indicates the college team as the first.  However, [[Lampeter Town RFC]] were the representatives of Lampeter at the formation of the WRU in 1881.\n\nThe red strip worn by Wales is one of the University's original strips and, as such, the College team is the only other club permitted to wear it. The club was one of the founder members of the [[Welsh Rugby Union]] in 1881 but, following trouble at a match against the [[University of Wales, Aberystwyth|University College of Wales, Aberystwyth]] in 1933, was reprimanded by the union.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Price, D. T. W. (David Trevor William)|title=A history of Saint David's University College Lampeter|date=1977-1990|publisher=University of Wales Press|isbn=0-7083-0606-3|location=Cardiff|oclc=3742391}}</ref>\n\nThe club's nicknames were ''Mad Pilgrims'' and ''Fighting Parsons'', reflecting Lampeter's history of training clergy. A match was played between the student team and an old boys (graduate) team on the first Saturday in December each year. In recent years, the old boys formed a touring side known as Old Parsonians RFC. The old boys have become known for their battle cry \"chuff\", which came into common use c. 2001. Old Parsonians play in a sky blue and white kit in recognition of the historical rugby link to Cambridge rugby through Rowland Williams.\n\n== The College Yell ==\nTaken from the Student Handbook 1938\u201339, the College Yell was originally used at sporting and other competitive events. It had largely fallen into obscurity by the twenty-first century, though occasionally resurrected by zealous students.\n\n''Hip Hip Hooray<br />Hip Hip Hooray<br />Hip Hip Hooray<br />Nawr Dewi.

Dewi Sant.\n\n== Student life ==\nThree full-time sabbatical officers and ten non-sabbatical officers oversaw student entertainment, welfare and childcare, as well as ensuring that the views of Lampeter students were represented on a national level, through affiliation with the [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]]. However, by 2015,  this had been cut to one sabbatical officer and 16 non-sabbatical officers. The Students Union also published a popular satirical magazine entitled 1822 which \"blends satire, pointlessness and toilet humour\".\n\nThe secluded rural location lends the campus a special atmosphere and a very high proportion of the students were involved in clubs, societies and associations. There were over 30 recognised bodies, ranging from the Chinese Society and the International Students' Association to Medieval Re-enactment, Fencing Club and Organic Gardening Society. Alongside these were student-run bodies not affiliated with the Students' Union, such as the Christian Union, Conservative Future and Amnesty.\n\nThere has been no train service to the town since the local line fell victim to the [[Beeching Axe]] in 1965 and only limited bus services remain. However for many who came there, this was a key attraction, with a high proportion of students getting involved with outdoor activities and local environmental projects.  Local country towns of [[Carmarthen]] and [[Llandeilo]] are nearby as well as the coastal resorts of [[Aberystwyth]] and [[New Quay]].  The union building, on the banks of the ''Afon Dulas'' and extended in 1998, contains a student bar and small club, known as the Xtension, which hosts parties and live music events; the Union also has a CineClub showing films in the Arts Hall and Cliff Tucker Theatre.\n\n== Notable academics ==\n{{see also|Category:Academics of the University of Wales, Lampeter}}\n[[File:Rolandwilliams.jpg|thumb|right|Reverend Professor Rowland Williams]]\n*Professor Emeritus [[Nigel Yates]] (Theology)\n*Reverend Professor [[Paul Badham]] (Theology)\n*Professor [[David Cockburn]] (Philosophy)\n*Rabbi Professor [[Dan Cohn-Sherbok]] (Jewish Studies)\n*Professor [[Tim Cresswell]] (Geography)\n*Doctor [[Dic Edwards]] (English)\n*Reverend [[Islwyn Ffowc Elis]] (Welsh)\n*Professor [[Harold Arthur Harris]] (Latin and Greek)\n*Professor [[Johannes Hoff]] (Theology)\n*Professor [[Chris Philo]] (Geography)\n*Professor [[Michael Shanks (archaeologist)|Michael Shanks]] (Archaeology)\n*Doctor [[Laurie Thompson]] (Swedish)\n*Professor [[Nigel Thrift]] (Geography)\n*Professor [[Thomas Frederick Tout]] (History)\n*Reverend Professor [[Rowland Williams (theologian)|Rowland Williams]] (Hebrew, also Vice-Principal of the college)\n\n== Notable alumni ==\n{{Main|List of University of Wales, Lampeter people}}\n\n== Academic departments ==\n\n*Chinese Studies<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lamp.ac.uk/chinese/ |title=University of Wales, Lampeter \u2013 Centre for Chinese Studies |publisher=Lamp.ac.uk |date=13 February 2010 |accessdate=2 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726095005/http://www.lamp.ac.uk/chinese/ |archive-date=26 July 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n*Classics<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lamp.ac.uk/classics/ |title=University of Wales Lampeter \u2013 Department of Classics |publisher=Lamp.ac.uk |accessdate=2 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324121558/http://www.lamp.ac.uk/classics/ |archive-date=24 March 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n*Film and Media<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lamp.ac.uk/fm/ |title=Film and Media @ the University of Wales, Lampeter, UK |publisher=Lamp.ac.uk |accessdate=2 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402064635/http://www.lamp.ac.uk/fm/ |archive-date=2 April 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n*English<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lamp.ac.uk/english/ |title=University of Wales Lampeter \u2013 Department of English |publisher=Lamp.ac.uk |accessdate=2 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100701163520/http://www.lamp.ac.uk/english/ |archive-date=1 July 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n*Management and Information Technology<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lamp.ac.uk/mit/ |title=Management & Information Technology \u2013 University of Wales Lampeter |publisher=Lamp.ac.uk |accessdate=2 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429233953/http://www.lamp.ac.uk/mit/ |archive-date=29 April 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n*Philosophy<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lamp.ac.uk/philosophy/ |title=University of Wales Lampeter &#124; Department of Philosophy |publisher=Lamp.ac.uk |date=1 September 2009 |accessdate=2 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100507123351/http://www.lamp.ac.uk/philosophy/ |archive-date=7 May 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n*Theology, Religious Studies and Islamic Studies<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lamp.ac.uk/trs/ |title=Department of Theology and Religious Studies, University of Wales Lampeter |publisher=Lamp.ac.uk |accessdate=2 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100515160143/http://www.lamp.ac.uk/trs/ |archive-date=15 May 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n*Voluntary Sector Studies<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.volstudy.ac.uk/ |title=Voluntary Sector Studies \u2013 Distance Learning for the Voluntary Sector |publisher=Volstudy.ac.uk |accessdate=2 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611085511/http://www.volstudy.ac.uk/ |archive-date=11 June 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n*Archaeology, History and Anthropology\n\n=== Defunct departments ===\n*[[Physical Science]]\n*[[Mathematics]]\n*[[Geography]]\n**Centre for Australian Studies in Wales\n*Modern Languages (French, German and [[Swedish language|Swedish]])\n*History (due to merging of departments)\n*[[Archaeology]] and [[Anthropology]] (due to merging of departments)\n*[[Welsh language|Welsh]] \u2013 no longer taught at undergraduate level\n\n== Lampeter Geography School ==\nThe '''Lampeter Geography School''' was an important collection of academics based at the Geography department of the University of Wales, Lampeter. The department has since closed, but the Lampeter diaspora continues to have a major impact on the academic discipline.\n\n===Establishment===\nThe [[Robbins Report]] of 1963 recommended immediate expansion of British universities. In its implementation of these recommendations, Lampeter planned to open new Economics and [[Geography]] departments. Economics was taught at first year level only. The groundwork was well in place for the Geography department to open by 1970 or '71. The new Arts Building of the University was opened by the [[Secretary of State for Wales]] on 4 October 1971, which provided the new department with luxurious lecture and teaching rooms in time for its opening. Dr David Thomas (not to be confused with David SG Thomas, Professor at Oxford) became the first Professor of Geography at Lampeter in 1970 and, in 1971, [[Donald A Davidson]] and John A Dawson joined the staff as lecturers, ready to welcome the first Geography students to Lampeter in October 1971.\n\n=== Academics of the Lampeter Geography School ===\n*Professor [[Paul Cloke]]\n*Professor [[Jo Little]]\n*Professor Martin Phillips\n*Professor [[Chris Philo]]\n*Professor [[Tim Cresswell]]\n*Professor [[David Sadler (geographer)|David Sadler]]\n*Professor Ulf Strohmayer\n*Professor [[Nigel Thrift]]\n*Professor [[John A.

With fewer than 2,000 students on campus, it is often claimed to be one of the smallest [[public university|public universities]] in Europe.\n\n==History==\nWhen [[Thomas Burgess (bishop)|Thomas Burgess]] was appointed [[Bishop of St David's]] in 1803, he saw a need for a college in which Welsh [[ordination|ordinands]] could receive a higher education. The existing colleges at Oxford and Cambridge were out of the geographical and financial means of most would-be students.\n\nBurgess had no Welsh connections; he was born in Odiham, Hampshire in 1756. After education at [[Winchester]] and [[Oxford]], he had short stays in [[Salisbury]] and [[Durham, England|Durham]] before being appointed to his first bishopric in Wales in 1803. Burgess intended to build his new college to train priests in [[Llanddewi Brefi]] which, at the time, was similar in size to Lampeter but ten kilometres from it and with an honoured place in the Christian history of Wales. When Burgess was staying with his friend the Bishop of [[Gloucester]] in 1820, however, he met [[John Scandrett Harford]], a wealthy landowner from [[Gloucestershire]].  Harford donated the three acre (12,000 m\u00b2) Castle Field site in Lampeter, named after the [[Norman architecture|Norman]] [[castle]] once contained in the field. This is the site on which the present University stands.\n\n[[File:Burgess39694.JPG|thumb|right|Engraving of Bishop Burgess]]\n[[File:View of St. David's College.jpeg|thumb|View of St. David's College c.1835]]\n'''St David's College''' was thus founded just outside Lampeter; the foundation stone was laid in 1822. Burgess left St. David's in 1825 to become [[Bishop of Salisbury]] but work on the college continued, largely supervised by Harford. The \u00a316,000 required to erect the college had been raised from public donations, a government grant and highly publicised gifts, including one from [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV]]. The main college building was completed in 1827 and the college officially opened on [[St. David's Day]] of that year, welcoming its first 26 students. As such, it was the oldest institution of higher education in Wales, and the third oldest in [[England and Wales]], receiving its first charter in 1828. In 1852, the college gained the right to award the degree of [[Bachelor of Divinity]] (BD) and, in 1865, the degree of Bachelor of Arts (BA), long before the other colleges in Wales gained their own degree awarding powers. As early as 1865, when a campaign had commenced to establish a University for Wales, there were suggestions that the College should take on this function. However, they were opposed by those who believed it should retain its original purpose as a theological college.<ref name=\"W 24-2-65 edit\">{{cite news |title=Editorial [untitled] |url=https://newspapers.library.wales/view/4352954/4352960/31 |accessdate=13 December 2018 |newspaper=Welshman |date=24 February 1865 |pages=4\u20135}}</ref>\n\nAlthough it continued as a centre of clergy training until 1978, there was always a proportion of students who did not intend to be ordained. The 1896 charter specifically stated that the college could accept anyone, regardless of whether they intended to take Holy Orders. Since 1925, it had been possible to study for a BA at the college without studying any theology at all. However, throughout the college's history, non-ordinands had been in a minority. In the 1950s the number of ordinands declined sharply and the College faced possible closure unless it could secure government funding. Principal [[John Roland Lloyd Thomas|J.R. Lloyd Thomas]] did not spare himself in the fight for survival and, in 1960, after much negotiation, [[Cardiff University|University College, Cardiff]], agreed to sponsor Saint David's. Thus the government finally began to assist SDC financially.\n\nIn 1971, the college became a member of the federal University of Wales and suspended its own degree-awarding powers. It became '''St David's University College''' (SDUC). By this time, the college had begun shifting its specialisms and, whilst theology continued to be a strong point, students could choose from a much wider range of [[liberal arts]] subjects. In 1996, the Privy Council\u2014in response to a petition from the University\u2014agreed to change its title again to the '''University of Wales, Lampeter''' in line with moves elsewhere in the University and the recognition of its growth and changing status. In September 2007, the University of Wales become confederal rather than federal in nature, effectively giving Lampeter independent university status. Unlike other former Wales colleges however, the institution's name remained unchanged.\n\nThe university specialised in Theology, [[Religious Studies]], philosophy, [[Classics]], [[Anthropology]], [[Archaeology]], [[English studies|English]] and History.  Prior to the merger, the university was also growing in disciplines from the [[liberal arts]] and [[social sciences]] such as Film and Media Studies, Information Society Studies, Business Management, Chinese Studies and Voluntary Sector Studies.  However, in the last two decades several other departments which taught subjects in their own right closed, notably French, German and [[Geography]].\n\nThe university had research and consultancy departments, including the Centre for Beliefs and Values, Centre for Enterprise, European and Extension Services, Archaeological Services and the Centre for the Study of Religion in Celtic Societies.\n\nIn the early 1990s, there also existed an influential [[Human geography]] department at the college. This was closed in 2001 but the [[diaspora]] of the Lampeter Geography School continue to have an influence on their field.\n\nIn 2008, the [[Quality Assurance Agency]] concluded that, although the quality of Lampeter's degrees was satisfactory, they had 'limited confidence' in the institution's quality assurance procedures and systems.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.qaa.ac.uk/reviews/reports/institutional/UoWLampeter/summary.asp |title=Institutional review \u2013 University of Wales, Lampeter |publisher=Qaa.ac.uk |date=25 May 2007 |accessdate=2 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325051824/http://www.qaa.ac.uk/reviews/reports/institutional/UoWLampeter/summary.asp |archive-date=25 March 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Further to this assessment, the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales commissioned a further report which found \"very real problems of leadership and management\" at the university.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lamp.ac.uk/news/press_releases/2008/new-university.html |title=Press Release: A New University in Wales? |publisher=Lamp.ac.uk |date=11 December 2008 |accessdate=2 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611223807/http://www.lamp.ac.uk/news/press_releases/2008/new-university.html |archivedate=11 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"independent1\">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher/is-a-merger-the-only-way-to-save-lampeter-1625432.html |title=Is a merger the only way to save Lampeter? \u2013 Higher, Education |work=The Independent |date= 19 February 2009|accessdate=2 May 2010 | location=London | first=Lucy | last=Hodges}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&storycode=404812 |title=Trinity College Carmarthen \u2013 Talks start on new university |work=Times Higher Education |date=1 January 2009 |accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref> As a direct result, on 14 December 2008, the university announced that it was in merger talks with [[Trinity College, Carmarthen]] with the intention of forming a new university in Wales.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trinitysaintdavid.ac.uk/en/news/new-university.asp|title=University of Wales Trinity Saint David \u2013 Error 404: Page not found|publisher=Trinitysaintdavid.ac.uk|accessdate=18 November 2014}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In July 2010, it was announced that the Queen had approved an order granting a supplemental charter to Lampeter which would create the new [[University of Wales, Trinity Saint David]] and which would accept its first students in September 2010<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trinitysaintdavid.ac.uk/en/news/uwtsd.asp|title=University of Wales Trinity Saint David \u2013 Error 404: Page not found|publisher=Trinitysaintdavid.ac.uk|accessdate=18 November 2014}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> at which time the University of Wales, Lampeter would formally cease to exist.\n\n== University buildings ==\n=== The Old College ===\n[[File:Uwlsdb.jpg|thumb|right|The St David's Building at the University of Wales, Lampeter]]\n[[C.R. Cockerell]] designed the original college, now called the Saint David's Building (Old Building or OB by students) in the centre of the Campus. It is a [[Grade II* listed building]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-10431-st-david-s-university-college-original-bu#.VorCWE9_cnM |title= St.david's University College (Original Buildings) College Street, Lampeter Date Listed: 21 September 1964 Cadw Building ID: 10431| publisher= Britisn Listed Buildings|accessdate= 4 January 2016}}</ref> and contains lecture rooms, common rooms, administrative offices, student residential accommodation and the following three main areas:\n\n'''The Old Hall''' was the refectory until the Lloyd Thomas Building came into use in 1969. It fell into disuse; however after much restoration, it re-opened in 1991 as one of the main public rooms for meetings, dinners, conferences and for use by outside organisations. It was also used for some examinations.\n\nThe Old Hall also contains paintings of various principals, presidents, benefactors, vice-chancellors ''et al.'' including Bishop Burgess, [[Maurice Jones]], [[Thomas Price (Carnhuanawc)|Thomas Price]],  [[Llewelyn Lewellin]], [[Edward Harold Browne]], [[Keith Robbins]] and [[Brian Morris, Baron Morris of Castle Morris|Brian Robert Morris]].\n\n'''St David's Chapel''' was consecrated in 1827. In 1879, it was rebuilt according to the specifications of the architect [[Thomas Graham Jackson]] of Cambridge. It re-opened on 24 June 1880. It was then refurbished again during the 1930s, mainly through the provision of a new [[reredos]] in 1933 and a major overhaul of the organ in 1934. The chapel was provided with a dedicated chaplain and services were held on Sundays and throughout the week as well as on saints' days and major festivals.\n\n'''The Founders' Library''' housed the main library until the new library opened in 1966. After this time the library housed the University's oldest printed books (1470\u20131850) and manuscripts (the earliest from the thirteenth century), given to Lampeter from 1822 onwards, as well as the archives of the university. It is a priceless collection unique to Lampeter. Named after its founders{{spaced endash}}Thomas Burgess (1756\u20131837), [[Thomas Bowdler]] (1754\u20131825), and [[Thomas Phillips (educational benefactor)|Thomas Phillips]] (1760\u20131851){{spaced endash}}it served as a resource for research and teaching, particularly in English, History and Mediaeval Studies. In 2005, it was announced that a new \u00a3700,000 library building was to be built on campus to house the university's special collections, as the Founders' Library was not environmentally suitable for such valuable documents. This extension to the main library was completed in 2008.\n\n=== Later additions ===\n[[File:Cantuwl.jpg|thumb|right|The Original Canterbury Building]]\n\n'''The Canterbury Building''' was built to house a growing number of students at the end of the 19th century. The foundation stone was laid by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] in 1885 and the building was officially opened on 24 June 1887. It contained a physical science laboratory, two lecture rooms and new accommodation. However, structural problems forced the university to demolish the original building in the summer of 1971. The second Canterbury Building was opened on 20 October 1973 by the Vice-Chancellor of the [[University of Kent]]. It was demolished, and replaced with the present Canterbury Building, during the 2012\u201313 academic year.\n\n'''The Main Library''' was opened on 7 July 1966 by the then Chancellor of the University of Wales, the [[Duke of Edinburgh]]. It was extended and then reopened by the [[Prince of Wales]] on 21 June 1984.\n\n'''The Arts Building''' was opened by The Rt. Hon [[Peter Thomas, Baron Thomas of Gwydir|Peter Thomas]], [[Secretary of State for Wales]] on 4 October 1971, in time for it to house the new [[Geography]] department. The [[Archaeology]] and [[Anthropology]] department has since moved into the ground floor of the building, the first floor being shared by the Department of Film and Media and the Department of Management and I.T. The building now houses the new combined A.H.A ([[Archaeology]], History and [[Anthropology]]) department.\n\n'''The Cliff Tucker Theatre''', on the banks of the River Dulas, was opened by Sir [[Anthony Hopkins]] in 1996 and contained teaching rooms, lecture theatres and a large computer room. It was named in honour of [[Cliff Tucker]], a former student and benefactor of the university.\n\n'''The Sheikh Khalifa Building''', completed in 1997 and named after Sheikh [[Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan]], a benefactor of the university, was the home of the Department of Theology, Religious Studies and Islamic Studies, one of the largest departments of its kind in the United Kingdom. It was opened by Professor Sir [[Stewart Sutherland, Baron Sutherland of Houndwood|Stewart Sutherland]]. Behind the departmental building is a small mosque, used by Islamic students and residents of the town.\n\n'''The Roderic Bowen Research Centre''', completed 2007 and named after [[Roderic Bowen]], a former president of the university, houses the Founders' Library collection and archives and adjoins the main library building. The centre was opened on 17 October 2008, by [[First Minister for Wales]], [[Rhodri Morgan]].\n\n'''The Confucius Institute''' opened in 2007, as the home of the University's department of Chinese Studies and had direct links to Chinese Cultural institutes.\n\n'''Archaeology Laboratories''' provided facilities for environmental archaeology, osteoarchaeology, soil studies and conservation.\n\n'''The Lloyd Thomas Refectory''' was the university's main dining hall, providing meals to guests and catered students and a regular Sunday carvery.\n\n'''The Media centre''' contained studios and recording facilities.\n\n'''Bishop Burgess Hall''' formerly housed the departments of Classics and Philosophy. In 2009 it was converted to become a hub for student services.\n\n== Academic dress ==\n[[File:Lampeter BA.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A modern reproduction of the original Lampeter BA hood]]\nFrom 1971, Lampeter awarded University of Wales degrees, and as such, the [[academic dress]] was that of the [[Academic dress of the University of Wales|University of Wales]] \u2013 graduates wore a black stuff gown, with bell sleeves for bachelors, and glove sleeve for masters. Hoods were lined with mazarin blue shot green (arts), mazarin blue shot red (divinity), lined yellow shot black (MSc) and yellow shot red, bound light blue (MBA).\n\nThe Lampeter academic dress for the degrees it awarded in its own right differed from this as follows:\n\n'''Undergraduates''' wore a black stuff gown, with bell-sleeves, with the whole sleeve split open in front. The year-round wearing of undergraduate academic dress ended in 1971 when Lampeter joined the University of Wales. However around 2006\u201310 there was some support for a resurrection of this tradition by current students.\n\n'''[[Bachelor of Divinity]]'''. A black gown, of MA pattern (long closed sleeves), with a double crescent cut at the end of each sleeve. A black silk hood, lined with dark violet silk, and bound with 1\" white silk. Originally, it could be made in either the Oxford or the Cambridge shape, but Cambridge became the norm.\n\n'''Bachelor of Arts'''. A black stuff gown of Cambridge BA pattern. A black silk hood, part-lined and bound with 'miniver' \u2013 white fur with black spots. (Rabbit was usually used, with 'stick-on' spots, on account of the cost of real miniver!). As with the BD, it could be made in either the Oxford or the Cambridge shape, but Cambridge became the norm.\n\nThere was also a two-year course for those who could not afford the full three-year one. From 1884, this was called the '''Licence in Divinity''' (LD). Holders wore the undergraduate gown, with a black stuff hood, lined with black stuff, and bound for 1\" with white silk. This was always Cambridge shape. The LD was not awarded after about 1940 and, in 1969, the hood was used for the DipTh, which was awarded until the College ceased clergy training in 1978. A degree with a similar title was introduced in 2007, the '''Licence in Divinity (Doctoral)''' (LicDD). This however, is a postdoctoral degree in theology or religious studies, the first of its kind in the UK. The academicals prescribed to this degree is non-conventional in that it consists of a scarlet [[mozzetta]] trimmed with white fur that is worn over the festal gown and under the hood (of the relevant Wales degree) and worn with a scarlet bonnet with gold cord and tassel. The degree was only awarded for a brief time before it was dropped.\n\nThe University awarded a number of '''Licences''' in Theology (LTh), Religious Studies (LRS), Islamic Studies, Latin, and Classical Greek.\n\n== Sports ==\nThe university has a sports hall with [[badminton]] and [[squash (sport)|squash]] courts, and a multigym with [[weight training]] equipment. For outdoor sports, the University has tennis courts, a [[cricket]] field and facilities for football, hockey and rugby. The college cricket pavilion, opened officially on 1 May 1909 is now a [[listed building]].\n\nLampeter has active [[netball]], [[field hockey]], [[association football|football]] and [[rugby union]] teams, all of which played in the college colours of [[Flag of Saint David|black and gold]].\n\n=== Rugby ===\nRugby was introduced to Lampeter by Vice-Principal [[Rowland Williams (theologian)|Rowland Williams]] around 1850 and, as such, the college can claim to have the oldest [[Rugby football]] team in Wales. Despite some debate as to whether this honour belongs to the town team or the University side, the Welsh Rugby Union's official history \"Fields of Praise: The Official History of the Welsh Rugby Union, 1881\u20131981\"<ref>Fields of Praise, The Official History of the Welsh Rugby Union 1881\u20131981 pp259, David Smith, Gareth Williams (1980)</ref> indicates the college team as the first.  However, [[Lampeter Town RFC]] were the representatives of Lampeter at the formation of the WRU in 1881.\n\nThe red strip worn by Wales is one of the University's original strips and, as such, the College team is the only other club permitted to wear it. The club was one of the founder members of the [[Welsh Rugby Union]] in 1881 but, following trouble at a match against the [[University of Wales, Aberystwyth|University College of Wales, Aberystwyth]] in 1933, was reprimanded by the union.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Price, D. T. W.

A match was played between the student team and an old boys (graduate) team on the first Saturday in December each year. In recent years, the old boys formed a touring side known as Old Parsonians RFC. The old boys have become known for their battle cry \"chuff\", which came into common use c. 2001. Old Parsonians play in a sky blue and white kit in recognition of the historical rugby link to Cambridge rugby through Rowland Williams.\n\n== The College Yell ==\nTaken from the Student Handbook 1938\u201339, the College Yell was originally used at sporting and other competitive events. It had largely fallen into obscurity by the twenty-first century, though occasionally resurrected by zealous students.\n\n''Hip Hip Hooray<br />Hip Hip Hooray<br />Hip Hip Hooray<br />Nawr Dewi.

However, by 2015,  this had been cut to one sabbatical officer and 16 non-sabbatical officers. The Students Union also published a popular satirical magazine entitled 1822 which \"blends satire, pointlessness and toilet humour\".\n\nThe secluded rural location lends the campus a special atmosphere and a very high proportion of the students were involved in clubs, societies and associations. There were over 30 recognised bodies, ranging from the Chinese Society and the International Students' Association to Medieval Re-enactment, Fencing Club and Organic Gardening Society. Alongside these were student-run bodies not affiliated with the Students' Union, such as the Christian Union, Conservative Future and Amnesty.\n\nThere has been no train service to the town since the local line fell victim to the [[Beeching Axe]] in 1965 and only limited bus services remain. However for many who came there, this was a key attraction, with a high proportion of students getting involved with outdoor activities and local environmental projects.  Local country towns of [[Carmarthen]] and [[Llandeilo]] are nearby as well as the coastal resorts of [[Aberystwyth]] and [[New Quay]].  The union building, on the banks of the ''Afon Dulas'' and extended in 1998, contains a student bar and small club, known as the Xtension, which hosts parties and live music events; the Union also has a CineClub showing films in the Arts Hall and Cliff Tucker Theatre.\n\n== Notable academics ==\n{{see also|Category:Academics of the University of Wales, Lampeter}}\n[[File:Rolandwilliams.jpg|thumb|right|Reverend Professor Rowland Williams]]\n*Professor Emeritus [[Nigel Yates]] (Theology)\n*Reverend Professor [[Paul Badham]] (Theology)\n*Professor [[David Cockburn]] (Philosophy)\n*Rabbi Professor [[Dan Cohn-Sherbok]] (Jewish Studies)\n*Professor [[Tim Cresswell]] (Geography)\n*Doctor [[Dic Edwards]] (English)\n*Reverend [[Islwyn Ffowc Elis]] (Welsh)\n*Professor [[Harold Arthur Harris]] (Latin and Greek)\n*Professor [[Johannes Hoff]] (Theology)\n*Professor [[Chris Philo]] (Geography)\n*Professor [[Michael Shanks (archaeologist)|Michael Shanks]] (Archaeology)\n*Doctor [[Laurie Thompson]] (Swedish)\n*Professor [[Nigel Thrift]] (Geography)\n*Professor [[Thomas Frederick Tout]] (History)\n*Reverend Professor [[Rowland Williams (theologian)|Rowland Williams]] (Hebrew, also Vice-Principal of the college)\n\n== Notable alumni ==\n{{Main|List of University of Wales, Lampeter people}}\n\n== Academic departments ==\n\n*Chinese Studies<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lamp.ac.uk/chinese/ |title=University of Wales, Lampeter \u2013 Centre for Chinese Studies |publisher=Lamp.ac.uk |date=13 February 2010 |accessdate=2 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726095005/http://www.lamp.ac.uk/chinese/ |archive-date=26 July 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n*Classics<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lamp.ac.uk/classics/ |title=University of Wales Lampeter \u2013 Department of Classics |publisher=Lamp.ac.uk |accessdate=2 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324121558/http://www.lamp.ac.uk/classics/ |archive-date=24 March 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n*Film and Media<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lamp.ac.uk/fm/ |title=Film and Media @ the University of Wales, Lampeter, UK |publisher=Lamp.ac.uk |accessdate=2 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402064635/http://www.lamp.ac.uk/fm/ |archive-date=2 April 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n*English<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lamp.ac.uk/english/ |title=University of Wales Lampeter \u2013 Department of English |publisher=Lamp.ac.uk |accessdate=2 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100701163520/http://www.lamp.ac.uk/english/ |archive-date=1 July 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n*Management and Information Technology<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lamp.ac.uk/mit/ |title=Management & Information Technology \u2013 University of Wales Lampeter |publisher=Lamp.ac.uk |accessdate=2 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429233953/http://www.lamp.ac.uk/mit/ |archive-date=29 April 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n*Philosophy<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lamp.ac.uk/philosophy/ |title=University of Wales Lampeter &#124; Department of Philosophy |publisher=Lamp.ac.uk |date=1 September 2009 |accessdate=2 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100507123351/http://www.lamp.ac.uk/philosophy/ |archive-date=7 May 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n*Theology, Religious Studies and Islamic Studies<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lamp.ac.uk/trs/ |title=Department of Theology and Religious Studies, University of Wales Lampeter |publisher=Lamp.ac.uk |accessdate=2 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100515160143/http://www.lamp.ac.uk/trs/ |archive-date=15 May 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n*Voluntary Sector Studies<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.volstudy.ac.uk/ |title=Voluntary Sector Studies \u2013 Distance Learning for the Voluntary Sector |publisher=Volstudy.ac.uk |accessdate=2 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611085511/http://www.volstudy.ac.uk/ |archive-date=11 June 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n*Archaeology, History and Anthropology\n\n=== Defunct departments ===\n*[[Physical Science]]\n*[[Mathematics]]\n*[[Geography]]\n**Centre for Australian Studies in Wales\n*Modern Languages (French, German and [[Swedish language|Swedish]])\n*History (due to merging of departments)\n*[[Archaeology]] and [[Anthropology]] (due to merging of departments)\n*[[Welsh language|Welsh]] \u2013 no longer taught at undergraduate level\n\n== Lampeter Geography School ==\nThe '''Lampeter Geography School''' was an important collection of academics based at the Geography department of the University of Wales, Lampeter.

In its implementation of these recommendations, Lampeter planned to open new Economics and [[Geography]] departments. Economics was taught at first year level only. The groundwork was well in place for the Geography department to open by 1970 or '71. The new Arts Building of the University was opened by the [[Secretary of State for Wales]] on 4 October 1971, which provided the new department with luxurious lecture and teaching rooms in time for its opening. Dr David Thomas (not to be confused with David SG Thomas, Professor at Oxford) became the first Professor of Geography at Lampeter in 1970 and, in 1971, [[Donald A Davidson]] and John A Dawson joined the staff as lecturers, ready to welcome the first Geography students to Lampeter in October 1971.\n\n=== Academics of the Lampeter Geography School ===\n*Professor [[Paul Cloke]]\n*Professor [[Jo Little]]\n*Professor Martin Phillips\n*Professor [[Chris Philo]]\n*Professor [[Tim Cresswell]]\n*Professor [[David Sadler (geographer)|David Sadler]]\n*Professor Ulf Strohmayer\n*Professor [[Nigel Thrift]]\n*Professor [[John A.

Written by [[Adam Schlesinger]], the song is performed by the fictional 1960s band The Wonders, who are the focus of the film. The song peaked at No. 41 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] and was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Academy Award]] and a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song|Golden Globe Award]] for Best Original Song in 1997.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/9348993/adam-schlesinger-that-thing-you-do-best-fake-song |title=With \u2018That Thing You Do!,\u2019 Adam Schlesinger Wrote One of the Best 'Fake' Songs in Film History |last=Hughes |first=Hilary  |date=April 1, 2020 |website=Billboard}}</ref>\n\n==In the film==\nIn 1964, an [[Erie, Pennsylvania]] band named \"The One-ders\" (later known as The Wonders) goes from a college talent show to climbing up the [[Billboard charts]] thanks to the song \"That Thing You Do\". Written by guitarist/vocalist Jimmy Mattingly II, it was originally crafted as a ballad. During the performance at the talent show, drummer Guy Patterson produces a much more up-tempo beat and the rest of the band follow suit, turning the song into an upbeat, [[Beatles]]-esque rock number. The song is a hit with the audience, and they win the talent show. From there, the band is picked up by a local manager who helps them get more shows in the area, and eventually the song receives radio airplay. The band is then signed to Play-Tone Records, under Mr. White's guidance, and the song climbs up the [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]], starting at #93, then #71, #49, and #21.  The following week, \"That Thing You Do\" climbs to #7, becoming the quickest charting song ever on Play-Tone Records. However, Jimmy walks out on the band before they can produce another record, so they eventually become [[one-hit wonder]]s.\n\nEarly in the film, when Jimmy and Lenny are asking Guy to join them at the talent competition at the college, Jimmy mentions they'll perform a song he wrote. Lenny takes offense to that by slapping Jimmy on the arm. Jimmy begrudgingly corrects himself by saying, \"''We'' wrote.\" Later, when the vinyl 45 is officially released, the label states: Written by James Mattingly II.  Later still, when being interviewed live on radio station KJZZ, Jimmy says of the song, \"We wrote it in my garage back in Erie, PA\".\n\nIn the film, the song is performed by James \"Jimmy\" Mattingly II on [[singing|lead vocals]] and [[guitar]], Leonard \"Lenny\" Haise on [[lead guitar]] and backing vocals, \"T.B. Player\" on [[bass guitar|bass]] and backing vocals (as a running gag, the bass player in the film is unnamed), and Guy \"Shades\" Patterson on [[drum]]s.  For their live performance of the song on ''The Hollywood Television Showcase'', studio bassist Scott \"Wolfman\" Pell replaced T.B. Player on bass and backing vocals.\n\nIn the fictitious \"mockumentary\" liner notes from the soundtrack CD, \"That Thing You Do\" peaked at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 during the summer of 1964.\n\n==In reality==\nThe song was written by [[Adam Schlesinger]], the bassist of the [[alternative rock]] group [[Fountains of Wayne]]. Schlesinger did not expect his song to be chosen, but tried as \"a personal exercise.\" Performers include [[Mike Viola]] on vocals with Schlesinger on backup vocals.\n\nThe song was released as a single, and although not as successful as was depicted in the film, the track still did moderately well in the US, peaking at #41 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. (It also reached #22 on the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] chart, #18 on the [[Adult Top 40]], and #24 on the [[Top 40 Mainstream]] chart.)<ref name=\"filmbuffonline\">[http://www.filmbuffonline.com/Features/ThatTuneYouDo.htm That Tune You Do- Writing The Music For THAT THING YOU DO<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127102824/http://www.filmbuffonline.com/Features/ThatTuneYouDo.htm |date=2007-11-27}}</ref> The song also reached #50 in [[ARIA Charts|Australia]].\n\nThe song was a bigger hit outside of the US, reaching #31 in Canada in December 1996,<ref name=\"bac-lac1996\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/films-videos-sound-recordings/rpm/Pages/image.aspx?Image=nlc008388.9720&URLjpg=http%3a%2f%2fwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca%2fobj%2f028020%2ff4%2fnlc008388.9720.gif&Ecopy=nlc008388.9720|title=Item Display - RPM - Library and Archives Canada |website=Collectionscanada.gc.ca |date=1996-12-06 |accessdate=2020-04-02}}</ref> and #22 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in February 1997.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\">{{cite book|first=David|last=Roberts|year=2006|title=British Hit Singles & Albums|edition=19th|publisher=Guinness World Records Limited |location=London|isbn=1-904994-10-5|page=610}}</ref> The song was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] at the [[69th Academy Awards]] as well as [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] at the [[54th Golden Globe Awards]], losing out on both occasions to [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s \"[[You Must Love Me]]\" (written by [[Tim Rice]] and [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]) from the musical ''[[Evita (1996 film)|Evita]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Golden Globes, USA (1997) |publisher=IMDB |url=https://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000292/1997 |accessdate=December 6, 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn April 25, 2017, three quarters of the actors who played The Wonders\u2014[[Tom Everett Scott]] (Guy \"Shades\" Patterson), [[Johnathon Schaech]] (Jimmy Mattingly II) and [[Ethan Embry]] (\"T.B.
