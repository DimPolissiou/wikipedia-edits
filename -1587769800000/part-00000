He would later captain and score for the side in their retention of the trophy [[2015 FA Cup Final|a year later]], before becoming the club's outright [[Captain (association football)|captain]] in 2016. He would again star in his third victory of the trophy in [[2017 FA Cup Final|2017]].

He educated himself, and found work as a schoolteacher. In the winter of 1837, Isaac married Eliza Ann Snider.  The two soon relocated back to Isaac\u2019s family farm where Isaac helped farm in the summer and taught school in the winter. He converted to Mormonism and set out to convert others in his neighborhood, building up a branch with forty members. To escape religious persecution, his family (wife and infant daughter, parents, one brother and two sisters, all of whom had joined the church) arrived in [[Nauvoo, Illinois]] in July, 1842.\n\n\nHe worked as a constable in Nauvoo, and was frequently asked to serve as a bodyguard for [[Joseph Smith]]. Haight was the first member of [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]] to hear of the [[death of Joseph Smith|death]] of Joseph Smith, the founder of the [[Latter Day Saint Movement]], when the messenger delivering the news of his assassination rode up to the [[Nauvoo Temple]], which Haight was guarding.\n\nHe emigrated with [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) to [[Utah]] in 1847. In December, 1849 Haight and fifty others were sent by [[Brigham Young]] to explore the mountains in southern Utah, about 300 miles south from [[Salt Lake City]]. Among these explorers were [[Parley P. Pratt]] and [[George A. Smith]], who also established a winter home there. From 1850 to 1852, he was sent to England to learn iron making, and upon his return was placed in charge of purchasing and assembling supplies for thousands of new European converts to cross the plains. In 1853, he married two additional wives. Upon his return to Utah, he was appointed to the territorial legislature, and was the first mayor of [[Cedar City, Utah]] where he was a farmer.\n\n==Mountain Meadows massacre==\n{{main|Mountain Meadows massacre}}\n\nBy September of 1857, tensions in Utah were running high.  Rumors that the United States government was sending troops to Utah, and fears that an approaching wagon train intended to stir up Indians against the Latter-day Saints, ushered in a crisis.  Isaac Haight, a prominent military, civic and church leader, was thrust into the middle of the situation.  A century and a half later, Isaac\u2019s role in what became known as the Mountain Meadows Massacre is still a matter of controversy.  Some believe that Isaac was in part responsible for the massacre; others argue that he had urged his fellow militiamen to be patient and wait for counsel to arrive from Brigham Young before taking action.  Nevertheless, one thing is certain: Isaac\u2019s life course was forever altered by the fateful events of that day.\n\nAt the time of the massacre, Haight was the [[Stake (Latter Day Saints)#Stake officers|Stake President]] over several [[Ward (LDS Church)|Wards]] in the area. Haight was in command of the Second Battalion, Tenth Regiment (or Iron County Militia), in which capacity he ordered the massacre of September 11, 1857, of the [[Baker-Fancher party]] of emigrants during the [[Utah War]].\n\nThe Baker-Fancher train was one of several emigrant trains traveling through the area on their way to California at the time.  [[George A. Smith]] had come down to southern Utah settlements and given orders for residents to prepare for war with [[United States troops]] who were approaching [[Utah]] to replace Governor [[Brigham Young]]. Haight promised Smith that the Tenth Regiment (of which Haight was second-in-command) could accomplish the ambush and destruction of \"invading\" federal troops before the troops would be able to make their way down through the canyons into the valleys.\n\n[[Jacob Hamblin]] had just been called to be the new president of a mission to Utah's Native Indian tribes. Hamblin had been dispatched to escort Chief [[Tutsegavit]] and other southern Utah [[Southern Paiute|Paiute]] chiefs to [[Salt Lake City]] where they were to meet with Brigham Young. At this meeting, Young communicated to them the policy that if the natives assisted the Latter-day Saints in fighting the Americans, the tribes were to be granted all the cattle on the California trails. Meanwhile, militia in southern Utah were mustered to search the canyons for invading troops and assist natives raiding settlers' stock.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n! 1857 !! width=\"700\"| Chronology    \n|-\n| (by July 24) || Southern Utah Latter-day Saints receive reports that 2,500 federal troops are approaching Utah.\n|- \n| August 4 || Brigham Young writes Hamblin concerning Hamblin's appointment as liaison to Native tribes. \n|-\n| August 8 || George A.

Lee]] in the early a.m. at the at-that-hour deserted location of the settlements' iron works and together they plan the \"Paiute\" attack on the first emigrant train.  \n|-  \n|}\n\nLater in the afternoon of September 5:  \n<blockquote>at a meeting of the high council in Cedar City, a divisive and quarrelsome debate was held to discuss the recent troubles with the passing emigrant train. Those present - stake president Haight, his counselor John Higbee, Bishop Klingensmith and high councilor Laban Morrill among others - generally agreed on the grievances they perceived in the company that had passed the previous Thursday. The cloud of war spreading over the territory prompted open debate of such extreme measures as attacking the train. Other, more moderate options were proposed. But there was no consensus on what action to take. Morrill extracted a promise that an express rider would be dispatched immediately for Great Salt Lake Valley to get directions from Brigham Young.<ref>{{Harvnb|Briggs|2002}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nOn September 6, Haight gave a speech in which he said, \"I am prepared to feed to the Gentiles the same bread they fed to us.  God being my helper, I will give the last ounce of strength and if need be my last drop of blood in defense of Zion.\"<ref>See [http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/mountainmeadows/leeaccount.html here].</ref>\n\nThat evening, the extended families making the Baker-Fancher train set up their camp in Mountain Meadows. After a siege of the train by Paiutes and militiamen (some of whom were disguised as Natives) for four or five days, militiamen ceremoniously arrived at the scene without disguise and approached the embattled train. For reasons still unclear, the militia used a subterfuge of offering safe passage to the emigrants in exchange for the emigrants' disarming and turning their cattle over to the Paiutes\u2014but after the emigrants were disarmed, militia members and Paiutes murdered all of the emigrant party except young children: about 120 slaughtered with seventeen children spared.\n\nScholars{{who|date=August 2014}} still debate whether senior LDS Church leadership, including Brigham Young, directly instigated the massacre or if responsibility lies with the local leaders of southern Utah.{{fact|date=August 2014}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nInvestigations were interrupted by the [[U.S. Civil War]]. Brigham Young removed Haight and certain others of the conspirators from good standing ([[Excommunication#The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|excommunicated]] them) from the LDS Church in 1870. By 1874, Haight and eight others (John D. Lee, John M. Higbee, William H. Dame, Philip Klingensmith, William C. Stewart, Elliot Willden, Samuel Jukes, and George Adair, Jr.) were indicted. Haight went into hiding with his son, Caleb, in Mormon outposts in southern Utah, Mexico, and Arizona. He remained a fugitive from federal authorities for the rest of his life. A reward of $500 each was posted for the capture of Haight, Higbee and Stewart. Only John D. Lee ever stood trial. Lee was convicted and executed by firing squad on March 23, 1877.\n\nAlthough he did go on numerous expeditions to the Indians with several Latter-day Saints, Isaac kept a low profile.  Because the reasons for his excommunication had been made public, he feared that, if found, federal officials would take him into custody.  During 1873 and 1874 Isaac worked as the foreman of the lumberyard that supplied wood to the St. George Temple, which was under construction at the time.  This job brought him into frequent contact with church leaders, including Brigham Young, who had a winter home in the St. George area.  Samuel Lorenzo Adams, \u201cone of Isaac\u2019s dearest and most loyal friends,\u201d recorded the events that led to Isaac\u2019s reinstatement into the LDS faith in 1874.  According to Adams, Brigham Young was invited to the Adams home in the late evening to discuss Isaac\u2019s membership.  Upon realizing this, Brigham responded: \u201cWhere is Isaac? I want to baptize him with my own hands.\u201d   Adams then sent for Isaac, who was warmly reunited with Brigham.  After this cordial visit, the three went to a nearby creek and Isaac was re-baptized that very night.  Afterwards, Brigham Young blessed Isaac and restored him to full fellowship.\n\nEventually, federal officials stopped pursuing Latter-day Saint leaders for their connections to the Mountain Meadows Massacre.  This, unfortunately, did not stop Church members, and non-Church members alike, from ostracizing and harassing Isaac.  Once, in his final years, he was even driven from the steps of the St. George Temple by a mob of enraged Mormons who believed he did not belong there with them to worship God.\n\n==Death==\nHaight died September 8, 1886, in [[Thatcher, Arizona]] at the age of 73.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n#{{Citation\n |last        = Briggs\n |first       = Robert H.\n |year        = 2002\n |title       = The Tragedy at Mountain Meadows Massacre: Toward a Consensus Account and Time Line\n |place       = Saint George, Utah\n |publisher   = Dixie State College of Utah\n |url         = http://library.dixie.edu/info/Collections/Brooks/TragedyatMountainMeadowsMassacre.html\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110726075143/http://library.dixie.edu/info/Collections/Brooks/TragedyatMountainMeadowsMassacre.html\n |archivedate = 2011-07-26\n}}.\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.mtn-meadows-assoc.com/isaac_haight.htm Sketch of Haight's life]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110726075143/http://library.dixie.edu/info/Collections/Brooks/TragedyatMountainMeadowsMassacre.html \"Tragedy at Mountain Meadows\", by Robert H.

Haight was the first member of [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]] to hear of the [[death of Joseph Smith|death]] of Joseph Smith, the founder of the [[Latter Day Saint Movement]], when the messenger delivering the news of his assassination rode up to the [[Nauvoo Temple]], which Haight was guarding.\n\nHe emigrated with [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) to [[Utah]] in 1847. In December, 1849 Haight and fifty others were sent by [[Brigham Young]] to explore the mountains in southern Utah, about 300 miles south from [[Salt Lake City]]. Among these explorers were [[Parley P. Pratt]] and [[George A. Smith]], who also established a winter home there. From 1850 to 1852, he was sent to England to learn iron making, and upon his return was placed in charge of purchasing and assembling supplies for thousands of new European converts to cross the plains. In 1853, he married two additional wives. Upon his return to Utah, he was appointed to the territorial legislature, and was the first mayor of [[Cedar City, Utah]] where he was a farmer.\n\n==Mountain Meadows massacre==\n{{main|Mountain Meadows massacre}}\n\nBy September of 1857, tensions in Utah were running high.  Rumors that the United States government was sending troops to Utah, and fears that an approaching wagon train intended to stir up Indians against the Latter-day Saints, ushered in a crisis.  Isaac Haight, a prominent military, civic and church leader, was thrust into the middle of the situation.  A century and a half later, Isaac\u2019s role in what became known as the Mountain Meadows Massacre is still a matter of controversy.  Some believe that Isaac was in part responsible for the massacre; others argue that he had urged his fellow militiamen to be patient and wait for counsel to arrive from Brigham Young before taking action.  Nevertheless, one thing is certain: Isaac\u2019s life course was forever altered by the fateful events of that day.\n\nAt the time of the massacre, Haight was the [[Stake (Latter Day Saints)#Stake officers|Stake President]] over several [[Ward (LDS Church)|Wards]] in the area. Haight was in command of the Second Battalion, Tenth Regiment (or Iron County Militia), in which capacity he ordered the massacre of September 11, 1857, of the [[Baker-Fancher party]] of emigrants during the [[Utah War]].\n\nThe Baker-Fancher train was one of several emigrant trains traveling through the area on their way to California at the time.  [[George A. Smith]] had come down to southern Utah settlements and given orders for residents to prepare for war with [[United States troops]] who were approaching [[Utah]] to replace Governor [[Brigham Young]]. Haight promised Smith that the Tenth Regiment (of which Haight was second-in-command) could accomplish the ambush and destruction of \"invading\" federal troops before the troops would be able to make their way down through the canyons into the valleys.\n\n[[Jacob Hamblin]] had just been called to be the new president of a mission to Utah's Native Indian tribes. Hamblin had been dispatched to escort Chief [[Tutsegavit]] and other southern Utah [[Southern Paiute|Paiute]] chiefs to [[Salt Lake City]] where they were to meet with Brigham Young. At this meeting, Young communicated to them the policy that if the natives assisted the Latter-day Saints in fighting the Americans, the tribes were to be granted all the cattle on the California trails. Meanwhile, militia in southern Utah were mustered to search the canyons for invading troops and assist natives raiding settlers' stock.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n! 1857 !! width=\"700\"| Chronology    \n|-\n| (by July 24) || Southern Utah Latter-day Saints receive reports that 2,500 federal troops are approaching Utah.\n|- \n| August 4 || Brigham Young writes Hamblin concerning Hamblin's appointment as liaison to Native tribes. \n|-\n| August 8 || George A.

Lee]] in the early a.m. at the at-that-hour deserted location of the settlements' iron works and together they plan the \"Paiute\" attack on the first emigrant train.  \n|-  \n|}\n\nLater in the afternoon of September 5:  \n<blockquote>at a meeting of the high council in Cedar City, a divisive and quarrelsome debate was held to discuss the recent troubles with the passing emigrant train. Those present - stake president Haight, his counselor John Higbee, Bishop Klingensmith and high councilor Laban Morrill among others - generally agreed on the grievances they perceived in the company that had passed the previous Thursday. The cloud of war spreading over the territory prompted open debate of such extreme measures as attacking the train. Other, more moderate options were proposed. But there was no consensus on what action to take. Morrill extracted a promise that an express rider would be dispatched immediately for Great Salt Lake Valley to get directions from Brigham Young.<ref>{{Harvnb|Briggs|2002}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nOn September 6, Haight gave a speech in which he said, \"I am prepared to feed to the Gentiles the same bread they fed to us.  God being my helper, I will give the last ounce of strength and if need be my last drop of blood in defense of Zion.\"<ref>See [http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/mountainmeadows/leeaccount.html here].</ref>\n\nThat evening, the extended families making the Baker-Fancher train set up their camp in Mountain Meadows. After a siege of the train by Paiutes and militiamen (some of whom were disguised as Natives) for four or five days, militiamen ceremoniously arrived at the scene without disguise and approached the embattled train. For reasons still unclear, the militia used a subterfuge of offering safe passage to the emigrants in exchange for the emigrants' disarming and turning their cattle over to the Paiutes\u2014but after the emigrants were disarmed, militia members and Paiutes murdered all of the emigrant party except young children: about 120 slaughtered with seventeen children spared.\n\nScholars{{who|date=August 2014}} still debate whether senior LDS Church leadership, including Brigham Young, directly instigated the massacre or if responsibility lies with the local leaders of southern Utah.{{fact|date=August 2014}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nInvestigations were interrupted by the [[U.S. Civil War]]. Brigham Young removed Haight and certain others of the conspirators from good standing ([[Excommunication#The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|excommunicated]] them) from the LDS Church in 1870. By 1874, Haight and eight others (John D. Lee, John M. Higbee, William H. Dame, Philip Klingensmith, William C. Stewart, Elliot Willden, Samuel Jukes, and George Adair, Jr.) were indicted. Haight went into hiding with his son, Caleb, in Mormon outposts in southern Utah, Mexico, and Arizona. He remained a fugitive from federal authorities for the rest of his life. A reward of $500 each was posted for the capture of Haight, Higbee and Stewart. Only John D. Lee ever stood trial. Lee was convicted and executed by firing squad on March 23, 1877.\n\nAlthough he did go on numerous expeditions to the Indians with several Latter-day Saints, Isaac kept a low profile.  Because the reasons for his excommunication had been made public, he feared that, if found, federal officials would take him into custody.  During 1873 and 1874 Isaac worked as the foreman of the lumberyard that supplied wood to the St. George Temple, which was under construction at the time.  This job brought him into frequent contact with church leaders, including Brigham Young, who had a winter home in the St. George area.  Samuel Lorenzo Adams, \u201cone of Isaac\u2019s dearest and most loyal friends,\u201d recorded the events that led to Isaac\u2019s reinstatement into the LDS faith in 1874.  According to Adams, Brigham Young was invited to the Adams home in the late evening to discuss Isaac\u2019s membership.  Upon realizing this, Brigham responded: \u201cWhere is Isaac? I want to baptize him with my own hands.\u201d   Adams then sent for Isaac, who was warmly reunited with Brigham.  After this cordial visit, the three went to a nearby creek and Isaac was re-baptized that very night.  Afterwards, Brigham Young blessed Isaac and restored him to full fellowship.\n\nEventually, federal officials stopped pursuing Latter-day Saint leaders for their connections to the Mountain Meadows Massacre.  This, unfortunately, did not stop Church members, and non-Church members alike, from ostracizing and harassing Isaac.  Once, in his final years, he was even driven from the steps of the St. George Temple by a mob of enraged Mormons who believed he did not belong there with them to worship God.\n\n==Death==\nHaight died September 8, 1886, in [[Thatcher, Arizona]] at the age of 73.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n#{{Citation\n |last        = Briggs\n |first       = Robert H.\n |year        = 2002\n |title       = The Tragedy at Mountain Meadows Massacre: Toward a Consensus Account and Time Line\n |place       = Saint George, Utah\n |publisher   = Dixie State College of Utah\n |url         = http://library.dixie.edu/info/Collections/Brooks/TragedyatMountainMeadowsMassacre.html\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110726075143/http://library.dixie.edu/info/Collections/Brooks/TragedyatMountainMeadowsMassacre.html\n |archivedate = 2011-07-26\n}}.\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.mtn-meadows-assoc.com/isaac_haight.htm Sketch of Haight's life]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110726075143/http://library.dixie.edu/info/Collections/Brooks/TragedyatMountainMeadowsMassacre.html \"Tragedy at Mountain Meadows\", by Robert H.

Ghamidi's inspiration from his mentor, [[Amin Ahsan Islahi]] and non-traditionalist approach to the religion has parted him from the conservative understanding on a large number of issues. However, Ghamidi argues that his dissenting conclusions are often based on traditional foundations set by classical scholars.\n\nIn Ghamidi's arguments, there is no reference to the Western sources, human rights or current philosophies of crime and punishment.<ref name=\"masud\" /> Nonetheless, employing the traditional Islamic framework, he reaches conclusions which are similar to those of [[Islamic Modernism|Islamic modernists]] and progressives on the subject.<ref name=\"masud\" />\n\n===Jihad===\nabc Ghamidi believes that there are certain directives of the [[Qur'an]] pertaining to war which were specific only to [[Prophet Muhammad]] and certain specified peoples of his times (particularly the progeny of [[Abraham]]: the [[Ishmaelites]], the [[Israelites]], and the [[Nazarites]]). Thus, Muhammad and his designated followers waged a war against Divinely specified peoples of their time (the [[polytheists]] and the [[Israelites]] and [[Nazarites]] of Arabia and some other Jews, Christians, et al.) as a form of Divine punishment and asked the polytheists of Arabia for submission to Islam as a condition for exoneration and the others for [[jizya]] and submission to the political authority of the Muslims for exemption from death punishment and for military protection as the [[dhimmi]]s of the Muslims. Therefore, after Muhammad and his companions, there is no concept in Islam obliging Muslims to wage war for propagation or implementation of Islam. The only valid basis for [[jihad]] through arms is to end oppression when all other measures have failed.<ref name=\"jihad\">''Mizan'', [http://www.renaissance.com.pk/junespart2y2.html The Islamic Law of Jihad] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121083252/http://www.renaissance.com.pk/junespart2y2.html |date=21 November 2008 }}</ref> According to him Jihad can only be waged by an organised Islamic state, that too only where a leader has been nominated by the previous leader or by the consensus of the [[ulema]] if the state is newly established.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ghamidi|first=Javed Ahmed|title=Qanun-i-Jihad (The Islamic Shari'ah of Jihad)|publisher=al-Mawrid|location=Lahore, Pakistan|page=45|isbn=978-9698799083|quote=It is obvious...that jihad becomes obligatory only in the presence of a ruler...whose political authority has been established either through nomination by the previous ruler similar to how Abu Bakr transferred the reins [of his Khilafah to Umar] or through the pledging of allegiance by the ulema}}</ref> No person, party or group can take arms into their hands (for the purpose of waging Jihad) under any circumstances.

The Qur'\u0101n (42:38) says: amruhum sh\u016br\u0101 baynahum (the affairs of the Muslims are run on the basis of mutual consultation). 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"Whosoever pledges allegiance to anyone without the collective consent of the Muslims presents himself for the death sentence\". It is true that, in Muslim history, monarchy and dictatorship have often been accepted forms of government. Some people also believe that the head of government should be a nominee of God Himself. However, the principle the Qur\u2019\u0101n spells out is very clear.}}\n\n===Morals and ethics===\nGhamidi is known for his stress on morals and ethics in Islam. He has raised concerns on moral and ethical issues in Muslims.\n\nA translated snippet from his book \"Ikhlaqiyat\":\n\n{{cquote|After faith, the second important requirement of religion is purification of morals. This means that a person should cleanse his attitude both towards his Creator and towards his fellow human beings. This is what is termed as a righteous deed. All the Shari'ah is its corollary. With the change and evolution in societies and civilizations, the Shari'ah has indeed changed; however faith and righteous deeds, which are the foundations of religion, have not undergone any change. The Qur'an is absolutely clear that any person who brings forth these two things before the Almighty on the Day of Judgement will be blessed with Paradise which shall be his eternal abode.}}\n\n==Interaction with other Islamic scholars==\nLike [[Maulana Wahiduddin Khan]], [[Naeem Siddiqui|Maulana Naeem Siddiqui]] and [[Israr Ahmed|Dr. Israr Ahmed]], Ghamidi also worked closely with [[Abul A'la Maududi|Maulana Syed Abul Ala Maududi]] (alternative spelling ''Syed'' ''Maudoodi''; often referred to as ''[[Maulana]] Maududi'') (1903\u20131979) and Maulana [[Amin Ahsan Islahi]]. His work with Maududi continued for about nine years before he voiced his first differences of opinion, which led to his subsequent expulsion from Mawdudi's political party, [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]] in 1977. Later, he developed his own view of religion based on [[hermeneutics]] and [[ijtihad]] under the influence of his mentor, [[Amin Ahsan Islahi]] (1904\u20131997), a well-known exegete of the Indian sub-continent who is author of [[Tadabbur-i-Qur'an]], a [[Tafsir]] (exegeses of [[Qur'an]]). Ghamidi's critique of Mawdudi's thought is an extension of [[Maulana Wahiduddin Khan|Wahid al-Din Khan]]'s criticism of Mawdudi. Khan (1925\u2013 ) was amongst the first scholars from within the ranks of [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]] to present a full-fledged critique of Mawdudi's understanding of religion. ''Khan's'' contention is that Mawdudi has completely inverted the Qur'anic worldview. Ghamidi, for his part, agreed with Khan that the basic obligation in [[Islam]] is not the establishment of an Islamic world order but servitude to God, and that it is to help and guide humans in their effort to fulfill that obligation for which religion is revealed. Therefore, Islam never imposed the obligation on its individual adherents or on the Islamic state to be constantly in a state of war against the non-Islamic world. In fact, according to Ghamidi, even the formation of an Islamic state is not a basic religious obligation for Muslims.<ref name=\"ifti\">Iftikhar(2005)</ref> Despite such extraordinary differences and considering Maududi's interpretation of \"[[political Islam]]\" as incorrect, Ghamidi in one of his 2015 interviews said that he still respects his former teacher like a father.<ref>{{Citation|last=Adil Khan|title=JAVED AHMED GHAMIDI a talk with Voice of America 2015|date=2015-06-14|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emjnLPeT938&t=653|accessdate=2016-05-20}}</ref>\n\nGhamidi's thought and discourse community has received some academic attention in the recent past by Pakistani scholar Dr. Husnul Amin whose critical analysis of Ghamidi's thought movement has received academic attention.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1347016|title=THE FAILED RATIONALIST|last=Rana|first=Muhammad Amir|date=23 July 2017|work=DAWN|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> Amin traces the history of secessionist tendencies within the mainstream Islamism, and its ruptures, and then critically examines Ghamidi's emergence and proliferation in society as an unprecedented phenomenon.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Observing Variants of POST-ISLAMISM: Intellectual Discourses and Social Movements (3rd edition)|last=Amin|first=Husnul|publisher=IRD|year=2019|isbn=978-969-7576-57-9|location=Islamabad|pages=310}}</ref> Ghamidi's views and discourse on Islam and democracy have also been examined in another cited research paper.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Amin|first=Husnul|date=2012|title=Post-Islamist Intellectual Trends in Pakistan: Javed Ahmed Ghamidi and His Discourse on Islam and Democracy|journal=Islamic Studies|volume=51|issue=2|pages=169\u2013192|jstor=23643959}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and recognition==\nIn 2009, Ghamidi was awarded [[Sitara-i-Imtiaz]], the third highest civilian honor of Pakistan.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/943236|title=List of civil award winners|date=2009-08-16|work=DAWN.COM|access-date=2018-05-14|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Resignation from Council of Islamic Ideology==\n{{See also|Hudood Ordinance}}\n'''Javed Ahmed Ghamidi''' resigned in September 2006<ref name=\"daily\">''[http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2006\\story_22-9-2006_pg3_1 Editorial: Hudood laws, Ghamidi's resignation and CII \u2014 government wrong on all counts] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414060608/http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2006 |date=14 April 2008 }}'', Daily Times, 22 September 2006</ref> from the ''Council of Islamic Ideology (CII)'',<ref name=\"council\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cii.gov.pk/about/council.asp|title=Council of Islamic Ideology|publisher=[[Pakistan Government]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928071707/http://www.cii.gov.pk/about/council.asp|archivedate=28 September 2007|url-status=dead|df=dmy}}</ref> a constitutional body responsible for providing legal advice on Islamic issues to the Pakistani government.

Ghamidi argued that this was a breach of the CII's jurisdiction, since the very purpose of the council is to ensure that Pakistan's laws do not conflict with the teachings of Islam. He also said that the amendments in the bill proposed by the ''Ulema'' committee were against the injunctions of Islam. This event occurred when the [[Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal|MMA]] threatened to resign from the provincial and national assemblies if the government amended the [[Hudood Ordinance]],<ref>[http://www.zeenews.com/znnew/articles.asp?aid=320445&sid=SAS MMA threatens to quit Parliament over Hudood laws], Zee News, 5 September 2006.</ref> which came into being under [[Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization]].

His television audience consists of educated, urban-based middle-class men and women between the ages of 20\u201335, as well as lay Islamic intellectuals and professionals. Ghamidi's religiously oriented audience tends to be dissatisfied with the positions of traditional ulema and Western-educated secular-liberal elite, and find his interventions and ideas more sensible, moderate, and relevant.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ahmad|first=Mumtaz|date=12 February 2010|title=Media-Based Preachers and the Creation of New Muslim Publics in Pakistan|url=https://www.nbr.org/publication/media-based-preachers-and-the-creation-of-new-muslim-publics-in-pakistan/|journal=NBR Special Report|volume=22}}</ref>\n\n*Alif<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geo.tv/|title=GeoTV Geo News Latest News Breaking News Pakistan Live Videos}}</ref> on [[Geo TV]] (in multiple airings)\n*Ghamidi<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geo.tv/geonews/program.asp?pid=530 |title=GeoTV Geo News Latest News Breaking News Pakistan Live Videos |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412072634/http://www.geo.tv/geonews/program.asp?pid=530 |archivedate=12 April 2008}}</ref> on Geo TV\n*''Live with Ghamidi'' on [[Aaj News|AAJ TV]] (usually Q/A format but with occasional special programs).

He describes a desire during his childhood years to establish a name linkage to his late grandfather Noor Elahi, after learning of his status as the one people of the area turned to, to resolve disputes. This reputation also led to his (grandfather's) reputation as a peacemaker (\u0645\u0635\u0644\u062d). Subsequently, one of the visiting Sufi friends of his father narrated a story of the patriarch of the Arab tribe Banu Ghamid who earned the reputation of being a great peacemaker.

Ghamidi's inspiration from his mentor, [[Amin Ahsan Islahi]] and non-traditionalist approach to the religion has parted him from the conservative understanding on a large number of issues. However, Ghamidi argues that his dissenting conclusions are often based on traditional foundations set by classical scholars.\n\nIn Ghamidi's arguments, there is no reference to the Western sources, human rights or current philosophies of crime and punishment.<ref name=\"masud\" /> Nonetheless, employing the traditional Islamic framework, he reaches conclusions which are similar to those of [[Islamic Modernism|Islamic modernists]] and progressives on the subject.<ref name=\"masud\" />\n\n===Jihad===\nGhamidi believes that there are certain directives of the [[Qur'an]] pertaining to war which were specific only to [[Prophet Muhammad]] and certain specified peoples of his times (particularly the progeny of [[Abraham]]: the [[Ishmaelites]], the [[Israelites]], and the [[Nazarites]]). Thus, Muhammad and his designated followers waged a war against Divinely specified peoples of their time (the [[polytheists]] and the [[Israelites]] and [[Nazarites]] of Arabia and some other Jews, Christians, et al.) as a form of Divine punishment and asked the polytheists of Arabia for submission to Islam as a condition for exoneration and the others for [[jizya]] and submission to the political authority of the Muslims for exemption from death punishment and for military protection as the [[dhimmi]]s of the Muslims. Therefore, after Muhammad and his companions, there is no concept in Islam obliging Muslims to wage war for propagation or implementation of Islam. The only valid basis for [[jihad]] through arms is to end oppression when all other measures have failed.<ref name=\"jihad\">''Mizan'', [http://www.renaissance.com.pk/junespart2y2.html The Islamic Law of Jihad] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121083252/http://www.renaissance.com.pk/junespart2y2.html |date=21 November 2008 }}</ref> According to him Jihad can only be waged by an organised Islamic state, that too only where a leader has been nominated by the previous leader or by the consensus of the [[ulema]] if the state is newly established.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ghamidi|first=Javed Ahmed|title=Qanun-i-Jihad (The Islamic Shari'ah of Jihad)|publisher=al-Mawrid|location=Lahore, Pakistan|page=45|isbn=978-9698799083|quote=It is obvious...that jihad becomes obligatory only in the presence of a ruler...whose political authority has been established either through nomination by the previous ruler similar to how Abu Bakr transferred the reins [of his Khilafah to Umar] or through the pledging of allegiance by the ulema}}</ref> No person, party or group can take arms into their hands (for the purpose of waging Jihad) under any circumstances. Another corollary, in his opinion, is that death punishment for [[apostasy]] was also specifically for the recipients of the same Divine punishment during Muhammad's times\u2014for they had persistently denied the truth of Muhammad's mission even after it had been made conclusively evident to them by God through Muhammad.<ref>''[http://www.renaissance.com.pk/septrefl22y2.html Islamic Punishments: Some Misconceptions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927205707/http://www.renaissance.com.pk/septrefl22y2.html |date=27 September 2007 }}'', [[Al-Mawrid|Renaissance \u2013 Monthly Islamic Journal]], 12(9), 2002.</ref>\n\nThe formation of an Islamic state is not a religious obligation ''per se'' upon the Muslims. However, he believes that if and when Muslims form a state of their own, Islam does impose certain religious obligations on its rulers as establishment of the institution of [[salat]] (obligatory prayer), [[zakah]] (mandatory charity), and [[Enjoin what is good and forbid what is wrong|'''amr bi'l-ma'ruf wa nahi 'ani'l-munkar'']] (preservation and promotion of society's good conventions and customs and eradication of social vices); this, in Ghamidi's opinion, should be done in modern times through courts, police, etc. in accordance with the law of the land which, as the government itself, must be based on the opinion of the majority.<ref name=\"ifti\"/>\n\n===Male-Female interaction===\nGhamidi argues that the Qur'an states [[Norm (sociology)|norms]] for male-female interaction in [[sura]]h [[An-Nur]].<ref>{{cite quran|24|27|31|style=ref}}</ref> While in [[sura]]h [[Al-Ahzab]], there are special directives for Muhammad's [[wives of Muhammad|wives]]<ref>{{cite quran|33|32|34|style=ref}}</ref> and directives given to Muslim women to distinguish themselves when they were being [[harass]]ed in [[Medina]].<ref>{{cite quran|33|58|61|style=ref}}</ref><ref name=\"norms\">''Mizan'', [http://www.renaissance.com.pk/novislaw2y2.html Norms of Gender Interaction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927205906/http://www.renaissance.com.pk/novislaw2y2.html |date=27 September 2007 }}</ref> The Qur'an has created a distinction between men and women only to maintain family relations and relationships.<ref name=\"soc\">''Mizan'', The Social Law of Islam</ref>\n\n===Penal laws===\n* The Islamic punishments of [[hudud]] (Islamic law) are maximum pronouncements that can be mitigated by a court of law on the basis of extenuating circumstances.<ref name=\"penal\">''Mizan'', [http://www.renaissance.com.pk/septfeart2y2.html The Penal Law of Islam] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070127184245/http://www.renaissance.com.pk/septfeart2y2.html |date=27 January 2007 }}</ref>\n* The [[shariah]] (Divine law) does not stipulate any fixed amount for the [[diyya]] (monetary compensation for unintentional murder); the determination of the amount\u2014for the unintentional murder of a man or a woman\u2014has been left to the conventions of society.<ref name=\"penal\"/>\n* ''[[Ceteris paribus]]'' (all other things being equal), a woman's testimony is equal to that of a man's.<ref>''[http://www.renaissance.com.pk/septrefl12y2.html The Law of Evidence] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211020525/http://www.renaissance.com.pk/septrefl12y2.html |date=11 February 2007 }}'', [[Al-Mawrid|Renaissance \u2013 Monthly Islamic Journal]], 12(9), 2002.</ref>\n*  Rape is [[hirabah]] and deserves severe punishments as mentioned in the {{cite quran|5|33|34|style=ref}}.

Fiqh is characterised as a human exercise, and therefore subject to human weakness and differences of opinion. A Muslim is not obliged to adhere to a school of fiqh.<ref name=\"masud\"/>\n\n===Taliban and Islamism===\n\nGhamidi is one of the Pakistani religious scholars who, from the beginning, has been opposing this kind of Islamism. One of his recent essays on this subject '''Islam and the Taliban'''<ref>[http://www.monthly-renaissance.com/issue/content.aspx?id=1158 Islam and the Taliban] published in ''Renaissance'', Lahore, May 2009)</ref>\n\n{{cquote\n|The Taliban say that democracy is a concept alien to Islam. The ideal way to set up an Islamic government in our times is the one that they adopted for Mullah Omar's government in Afghanistan. The constitution, the parliament, and elections are nothing but modern day shams...I can say with full confidence on the basis of my study of Islam that this viewpoint and this strategy (of Taliban) is not acceptable to the Qur'\u0101n. It prescribes democracy as the way to run the affairs of the state. The Qur'\u0101n (42:38) says: amruhum sh\u016br\u0101 baynahum (the affairs of the Muslims are run on the basis of mutual consultation). 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said: \"Whosoever pledges allegiance to anyone without the collective consent of the Muslims presents himself for the death sentence\". It is true that, in Muslim history, monarchy and dictatorship have often been accepted forms of government. Some people also believe that the head of government should be a nominee of God Himself. However, the principle the Qur\u2019\u0101n spells out is very clear.}}\n\n===Morals and ethics===\nGhamidi is known for his stress on morals and ethics in Islam. He has raised concerns on moral and ethical issues in Muslims.\n\nA translated snippet from his book \"Ikhlaqiyat\":\n\n{{cquote|After faith, the second important requirement of religion is purification of morals. This means that a person should cleanse his attitude both towards his Creator and towards his fellow human beings. This is what is termed as a righteous deed. All the Shari'ah is its corollary. With the change and evolution in societies and civilizations, the Shari'ah has indeed changed; however faith and righteous deeds, which are the foundations of religion, have not undergone any change. The Qur'an is absolutely clear that any person who brings forth these two things before the Almighty on the Day of Judgement will be blessed with Paradise which shall be his eternal abode.}}\n\n==Interaction with other Islamic scholars==\nLike [[Maulana Wahiduddin Khan]], [[Naeem Siddiqui|Maulana Naeem Siddiqui]] and [[Israr Ahmed|Dr. Israr Ahmed]], Ghamidi also worked closely with [[Abul A'la Maududi|Maulana Syed Abul Ala Maududi]] (alternative spelling ''Syed'' ''Maudoodi''; often referred to as ''[[Maulana]] Maududi'') (1903\u20131979) and Maulana [[Amin Ahsan Islahi]]. His work with Maududi continued for about nine years before he voiced his first differences of opinion, which led to his subsequent expulsion from Mawdudi's political party, [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]] in 1977. Later, he developed his own view of religion based on [[hermeneutics]] and [[ijtihad]] under the influence of his mentor, [[Amin Ahsan Islahi]] (1904\u20131997), a well-known exegete of the Indian sub-continent who is author of [[Tadabbur-i-Qur'an]], a [[Tafsir]] (exegeses of [[Qur'an]]). Ghamidi's critique of Mawdudi's thought is an extension of [[Maulana Wahiduddin Khan|Wahid al-Din Khan]]'s criticism of Mawdudi. Khan (1925\u2013 ) was amongst the first scholars from within the ranks of [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]] to present a full-fledged critique of Mawdudi's understanding of religion. ''Khan's'' contention is that Mawdudi has completely inverted the Qur'anic worldview. Ghamidi, for his part, agreed with Khan that the basic obligation in [[Islam]] is not the establishment of an Islamic world order but servitude to God, and that it is to help and guide humans in their effort to fulfill that obligation for which religion is revealed. Therefore, Islam never imposed the obligation on its individual adherents or on the Islamic state to be constantly in a state of war against the non-Islamic world. In fact, according to Ghamidi, even the formation of an Islamic state is not a basic religious obligation for Muslims.<ref name=\"ifti\">Iftikhar(2005)</ref> Despite such extraordinary differences and considering Maududi's interpretation of \"[[political Islam]]\" as incorrect, Ghamidi in one of his 2015 interviews said that he still respects his former teacher like a father.<ref>{{Citation|last=Adil Khan|title=JAVED AHMED GHAMIDI a talk with Voice of America 2015|date=2015-06-14|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emjnLPeT938&t=653|accessdate=2016-05-20}}</ref>\n\nGhamidi's thought and discourse community has received some academic attention in the recent past by Pakistani scholar Dr. Husnul Amin whose critical analysis of Ghamidi's thought movement has received academic attention.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1347016|title=THE FAILED RATIONALIST|last=Rana|first=Muhammad Amir|date=23 July 2017|work=DAWN|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> Amin traces the history of secessionist tendencies within the mainstream Islamism, and its ruptures, and then critically examines Ghamidi's emergence and proliferation in society as an unprecedented phenomenon.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Observing Variants of POST-ISLAMISM: Intellectual Discourses and Social Movements (3rd edition)|last=Amin|first=Husnul|publisher=IRD|year=2019|isbn=978-969-7576-57-9|location=Islamabad|pages=310}}</ref> Ghamidi's views and discourse on Islam and democracy have also been examined in another cited research paper.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Amin|first=Husnul|date=2012|title=Post-Islamist Intellectual Trends in Pakistan: Javed Ahmed Ghamidi and His Discourse on Islam and Democracy|journal=Islamic Studies|volume=51|issue=2|pages=169\u2013192|jstor=23643959}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and recognition==\nIn 2009, Ghamidi was awarded [[Sitara-i-Imtiaz]], the third highest civilian honor of Pakistan.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/943236|title=List of civil award winners|date=2009-08-16|work=DAWN.COM|access-date=2018-05-14|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Resignation from Council of Islamic Ideology==\n{{See also|Hudood Ordinance}}\n'''Javed Ahmed Ghamidi''' resigned in September 2006<ref name=\"daily\">''[http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2006\\story_22-9-2006_pg3_1 Editorial: Hudood laws, Ghamidi's resignation and CII \u2014 government wrong on all counts] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414060608/http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2006 |date=14 April 2008 }}'', Daily Times, 22 September 2006</ref> from the ''Council of Islamic Ideology (CII)'',<ref name=\"council\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cii.gov.pk/about/council.asp|title=Council of Islamic Ideology|publisher=[[Pakistan Government]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928071707/http://www.cii.gov.pk/about/council.asp|archivedate=28 September 2007|url-status=dead|df=dmy}}</ref> a constitutional body responsible for providing legal advice on Islamic issues to the Pakistani government.
