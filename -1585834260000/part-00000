His mother was Maryna Mokievska (1624\u20131707) (known from 1674\u201375 by her monastic name Maria Magdalena),<ref>[http://www.istpravda.com.ua/short/2012/11/21/100727/ \u041d\u0430 \u041f\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0440\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0443 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0435\u043d\u043e \u043c\u043e\u0433\u0438\u043b\u0443 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0456 \u041c\u0430\u0437\u0435\u043f\u0438 (At Pechersk is found a burial of Mazepa's mother)]. [[Ukrayinska Pravda]]</ref> and his father was Stefan Adam Mazepa (?-1666). Maryna Mokievska came  from the family of a Cossack officer who fought alongside [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]]. She gave birth to two children \u2013 Ivan and Oleksandra. Stefan Mazepa served as an Otaman of [[Bila Tserkva]] (1654), a Cossack representative of the King of the Polish-Lithuanian [[Rzecz Pospolita]], and a Czernih\u00f3w [[podczaszy]] (Cup-bearer of Chernihiv, 1662).\n\nIvan Mazepa was educated first in the [[Kyiv-Mohyla Academy]], then at a Jesuit college in [[Warsaw]]. As a [[page (servant)|page]] Mazepa was sent to study \"gunnery\" in [[Deventer]] ([[Dutch Republic]]) in 1656\u20131659, during which time he traveled across [[Western Europe]].<ref name=\"encyclopedia\">{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?AddButton=pages\\M\\A\\MazepaIvan.htm |title=Encyclopedia of Ukraine |publisher=Encyclopediaofukraine.com |date= |accessdate=8 May 2013}}</ref> From 1659 he served at the court of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish]] king, [[John II Casimir]] (reigned 1648\u20131668) on numerous diplomatic missions to Ukraine.<ref name=\"encyclopedia\"/> His service at the Polish royal court earned him a reputation as an alleged catholicized \"Lyakh\"<ref>[[Mykhailo Hrushevsky|Hrushevsky, M.]], page 382.</ref> \u2013 later the Russian Imperial government would effectively use this slur to discredit Mazepa.

At the same time Ivan Mazepa signed the [[Kolomak Articles]], which were based on the [[Hlukhiv Articles]] of [[Demian Mnohohrishny]].\n\nGradually, Mazepa accumulated great wealth, becoming one of Europe's largest land owners. A multitude of churches were built all over Ukraine during his reign in the [[Ukrainian Baroque]] style. He founded schools and printing houses, and expanded the [[Kyiv-Mohyla Academy]], the primary educational institution of Ukraine at the time, to accommodate 2,000 students.\n\nIn 1702, the Cossacks of [[Right-bank Ukraine]], under the leadership of hetman [[Semen Paliy]], began an uprising against [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]], which after early successes was defeated. Mazepa convinced Russian Tsar [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I]] to allow him to intervene, which he successfully did, taking over major portions of Right-bank Ukraine, while Poland was weakened by an invasion of Swedish king [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]].\n\n===The Great Northern War===\n{{see also|Campaign of Grodno}}\nIn the beginning of the 18th century, as the [[Russian Empire]] lost significant territory in the [[Great Northern War]], Peter I decided to reform the Russian army and to centralize control over his realm. In Mazepa's opinion, the strengthening of Russia's central power could put at risk the broad autonomy granted to the [[Cossack Hetmanate]] under the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]] in 1654. Attempts to assert control over the Zaporozhian Cossacks included demands of having them fight in any of the tsar's wars, instead of only defending their own land against regional enemies as was agreed to in previous treaties. Now Cossack forces were made to fight in distant wars in [[Livonia]] and [[Lithuania]], leaving their own homes unprotected from the [[Tatars]] and [[Poles]]. Ill-equipped and not properly trained to fight on par with the tactics of modern European armies, Cossacks suffered heavy losses and low morale. The Hetman himself started to feel his post threatened in the face of increasing calls to replace him with one of the abundant generals of the Russian army.\n\n===Change of sides===\nThe last straw in the souring relations with Tsar Peter was his refusal to commit any significant force to defend Ukraine against the Polish King [[Stanislaus Leszczynski]], an ally of [[Charles XII of Sweden]], who threatened to attack the [[Cossack Hetmanate]] in 1708. Peter expected that king Charles of Sweden was going to attack and thought that he could spare no forces. In the opinion of Mazepa, this blatantly violated the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]], since Russia refused to protect Ukraine's territory and left it to fare on its own. As the Swedish and Polish armies advanced towards Ukraine, Mazepa allied with them on 28 October 1708. However, only 3,000 Cossacks followed their Hetman, with the rest remaining loyal to the Tsar. Mazepa's call to arms was further weakened by the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox Clergy]]'s allegiance to the Tsar. Learning of Mazepa's treason, the Russian army sacked and razed the Cossack Hetmanate capital of [[Baturyn]], killing most of the defending garrison and many common people. The Russian army was ordered to tie the dead Cossacks to crosses and float them down the [[Dnieper River]] to the [[Black Sea]].\n\nThose Cossacks who did not side with Mazepa elected a new hetman, [[Ivan Skoropadsky]], on 11 November 1708. The fear of further reprisals and suspicion of Mazepa's newfound Swedish ally prevented most of Ukraine's population from siding with him. Surprisingly, the only significant support that he gathered came from the [[Zaporizhian Sich]], which, though at odds with the Hetman in the past, considered him and the nobility he represented a lesser evil compared with the Tsar. The Sich Cossacks paid dearly for their support of Mazepa, as Peter The Great ordered the Sich to be razed in 1709 and a decree was issued to execute any active Zaporizhian Cossack.\n\n===Decisive battle===\n[[File:Mazepa2.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]] and [[Mazepa]] at [[Dnieper River]] after the [[Battle of Poltava]]]]\n\nThe Swedish and Russian armies spent the first half of 1709 maneuvering for advantage in the anticipated great battle, and trying to secure the support of the local populace. Finally in June the [[Battle of Poltava]] took place. It was won by Russia and Peter The Great , putting an end to Mazepa's hopes of transferring Ukraine into the control of Sweden, which in a treaty had promised independence to Ukraine. Mazepa fled with [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]] to the [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] [[fortress]] of [[Bendery]], where Mazepa soon died.\n\nMazepa was buried in Gala\u021bi (now Romania), but his tomb was disturbed several times and eventually lost as a result of the Sf\u00e2ntul Gheorghe (St. George) Church demolition in 1962.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://adevarul.ro/locale/galati/cine-fost-cazacul-mazepa-razboinicul-tulbura-europa-300-ani-moarte-rapus-pamant-romanesc-fost-ingropat-sase-ori-1_55df2afef5eaafab2cf9d431/index.html|title=Cine a fost cazacul Mazepa, r\u0103zboinicul care tulbur\u0103 Europa chiar \u015fi dup\u0103 300 de ani de la moarte.

However, others argue that it was Imperial Russia who broke the treaty by not even trying to protect the Cossack homeland during busy fighting abroad while Ukrainian peasants were complaining about the conduct of local [[Muscovy|Muscovite]] troops. Many Cossacks had died while building [[Saint Petersburg]], and the Tsar planned to deploy Cossack troops far from their homeland.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=t124cP06gg0C&pg=PA244 A History of Ukraine], [[Paul Robert Magocsi]], [[University of Toronto Press]], 1996, {{ISBN|978-0-8020-7820-9}}, page 244</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/details/ukrainehistory00subt_0/page/160 Ukraine: A History] by [[Orest Subtelny]], [[University of Toronto Press]], 2000, {{ISBN|978-0-8020-8390-6}}, page 164</ref>\n\n[[File:Ivan Mazepa Poltava.jpg|thumb|left|Mazepa monument in Poltava]]\n\nThe image of a disgraceful traitor persisted throughout Russian and Soviet history. The [[Russian Orthodox Church]] [[anathema]]ised and [[excommunication|excommunicated]] him for political reasons. Until 1869, his name was even added to the list of traitors publicly cursed in Russian churches during the [[Feast of Orthodoxy]] service, along with [[Pugachev]], [[Stenka Razin|Razin]] and [[False Dmitry I]]. Later, a positive view of Mazepa was taboo in the [[Soviet Union]] and considered as a sign of \"Ukrainian [[bourgeois nationalism]]\". During the years of [[Perestroika]], however, many historical works saw light that viewed Mazepa differently. After [[Ukraine]]'s independence in 1991, Mazepa was proclaimed a national hero in Ukraine's official historiography and mainstream media,{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} as he was the first post-Pereyaslav Treaty hetman to take a stand against the Tsar, who failed to abide by the Treaty.

His mother was Maryna Mokievska (1624\u20131707) (known from 1674\u201375 by her monastic name Maria Magdalena),<ref>[http://www.istpravda.com.ua/short/2012/11/21/100727/ \u041d\u0430 \u041f\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0440\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0443 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0435\u043d\u043e \u043c\u043e\u0433\u0438\u043b\u0443 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0456 \u041c\u0430\u0437\u0435\u043f\u0438 (At Pechersk is found a burial of Mazepa's mother)]. [[Ukrayinska Pravda]]</ref> and his father was Stefan Adam Mazepa (?-1666). Maryna Mokievska came  from the family of a Cossack officer who fought alongside [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]]. She gave birth to two children \u2013 Ivan and Oleksandra. Stefan Mazepa served as an Otaman of [[Bila Tserkva]] (1654), a Cossack representative of the King of the Polish-Lithuanian [[Rzecz Pospolita]], and a Czernih\u00f3w [[podczaszy]] (Cup-bearer of Chernihiv, 1662).\n\nIvan Mazepa was educated first in the [[Kyiv-Mohyla Academy]], then at a Jesuit college in [[Warsaw]]. As a [[page (servant)|page]] Mazepa was sent to study \"gunnery\" in [[Deventer]] ([[Dutch Republic]]) in 1656\u20131659, during which time he traveled across [[Western Europe]].<ref name=\"encyclopedia\">{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?AddButton=pages\\M\\A\\MazepaIvan.htm |title=Encyclopedia of Ukraine |publisher=Encyclopediaofukraine.com |date= |accessdate=8 May 2013}}</ref> From 1659 he served at the court of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish]] king, [[John II Casimir]] (reigned 1648\u20131668) on numerous diplomatic missions to Ukraine.<ref name=\"encyclopedia\"/> His service at the Polish royal court earned him a reputation as an alleged catholicized \"Lyakh\"<ref>[[Mykhailo Hrushevsky|Hrushevsky, M.]], page 382.</ref> \u2013 later the Russian Imperial government would effectively use this slur to discredit Mazepa.

At the same time Ivan Mazepa signed the [[Kolomak Articles]], which were based on the [[Hlukhiv Articles]] of [[Demian Mnohohrishny]].\n\nGradually, Mazepa accumulated great wealth, becoming one of Europe's largest land owners. A multitude of churches were built all over Ukraine during his reign in the [[Ukrainian Baroque]] style. He founded schools and printing houses, and expanded the [[Kyiv-Mohyla Academy]], the primary educational institution of Ukraine at the time, to accommodate 2,000 students.\n\nIn 1702, the Cossacks of [[Right-bank Ukraine]], under the leadership of hetman [[Semen Paliy]], began an uprising against [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]], which after early successes was defeated. Mazepa convinced Russian Tsar [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I]] to allow him to intervene, which he successfully did, taking over major portions of Right-bank Ukraine, while Poland was weakened by an invasion of Swedish king [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]].\n\n===The Great Northern War===\n{{see also|Campaign of Grodno}}\nIn the beginning of the 18th century, as the [[Russian Empire]] lost significant territory in the [[Great Northern War]], Peter I decided to reform the Russian army and to centralize control over his realm. In Mazepa's opinion, the strengthening of Russia's central power could put at risk the broad autonomy granted to the [[Cossack Hetmanate]] under the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]] in 1654. Attempts to assert control over the Zaporozhian Cossacks included demands of having them fight in any of the tsar's wars, instead of only defending their own land against regional enemies as was agreed to in previous treaties. Now Cossack forces were made to fight in distant wars in [[Livonia]] and [[Lithuania]], leaving their own homes unprotected from the [[Tatars]] and [[Poles]]. Ill-equipped and not properly trained to fight on par with the tactics of modern European armies, Cossacks suffered heavy losses and low morale. The Hetman himself started to feel his post threatened in the face of increasing calls to replace him with one of the abundant generals of the Russian army.\n\n===Change of sides===\nThe last straw in the souring relations with Tsar Peter was his refusal to commit any significant force to defend Ukraine against the Polish King [[Stanislaus Leszczynski]], an ally of [[Charles XII of Sweden]], who threatened to attack the [[Cossack Hetmanate]] in 1708. Peter expected that king Charles of Sweden was going to attack and thought that he could spare no forces. In the opinion of Mazepa, this blatantly violated the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]], since Russia refused to protect Ukraine's territory and left it to fare on its own. As the Swedish and Polish armies advanced towards Ukraine, Mazepa allied with them on 28 October 1708. However, only 3,000 Cossacks followed their Hetman, with the rest remaining loyal to the Tsar. Mazepa's call to arms was further weakened by the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox Clergy]]'s allegiance to the Tsar. Learning of Mazepa's treason, the Russian army sacked and razed the Cossack Hetmanate capital of [[Baturyn]], killing most of the defending garrison and many common people. The Russian army was ordered to tie the dead Cossacks to crosses and float them down the [[Dnieper River]] to the [[Black Sea]].\n\nThose Cossacks who did not side with Mazepa elected a new hetman, [[Ivan Skoropadsky]], on 11 November 1708. The fear of further reprisals and suspicion of Mazepa's newfound Swedish ally prevented most of Ukraine's population from siding with him. Surprisingly, the only significant support that he gathered came from the [[Zaporizhian Sich]], which, though at odds with the Hetman in the past, considered him and the nobility he represented a lesser evil compared with the Tsar. The Sich Cossacks paid dearly for their support of Mazepa, as Peter The Great ordered the Sich to be razed in 1709 and a decree was issued to execute any active Zaporizhian Cossack.\n\n===Decisive battle===\n[[File:Mazepa2.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]] and [[Mazepa]] at [[Dnieper River]] after the [[Battle of Poltava]]]]\n\nThe Swedish and Russian armies spent the first half of 1709 maneuvering for advantage in the anticipated great battle, and trying to secure the support of the local populace. Finally in June the [[Battle of Poltava]] took place. It was won by Russia and Peter The Great , putting an end to Mazepa's hopes of transferring Ukraine into the control of Sweden, which in a treaty had promised independence to Ukraine. Mazepa fled with [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]] to the [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] [[fortress]] of [[Bendery]], where Mazepa soon died.\n\nMazepa was buried in Gala\u021bi (now Romania), but his tomb was disturbed several times and eventually lost as a result of the Sf\u00e2ntul Gheorghe (St. George) Church demolition in 1962.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://adevarul.ro/locale/galati/cine-fost-cazacul-mazepa-razboinicul-tulbura-europa-300-ani-moarte-rapus-pamant-romanesc-fost-ingropat-sase-ori-1_55df2afef5eaafab2cf9d431/index.html|title=Cine a fost cazacul Mazepa, r\u0103zboinicul care tulbur\u0103 Europa chiar \u015fi dup\u0103 300 de ani de la moarte.

However, others argue that it was Imperial Russia who broke the treaty by not even trying to protect the Cossack homeland during busy fighting abroad while Ukrainian peasants were complaining about the conduct of local [[Muscovy|Muscovite]] troops. Many Cossacks had died while building [[Saint Petersburg]], and the Tsar planned to deploy Cossack troops far from their homeland.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=t124cP06gg0C&pg=PA244 A History of Ukraine], [[Paul Robert Magocsi]], [[University of Toronto Press]], 1996, {{ISBN|978-0-8020-7820-9}}, page 244</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/details/ukrainehistory00subt_0/page/160 Ukraine: A History] by [[Orest Subtelny]], [[University of Toronto Press]], 2000, {{ISBN|978-0-8020-8390-6}}, page 164</ref>\n\n[[File:Ivan Mazepa Poltava.jpg|thumb|left|Mazepa monument in Poltava]]\n\nThe image of a disgraceful traitor persisted throughout Russian and Soviet history.

Until 1869, his name was even added to the list of traitors publicly cursed in Russian churches during the [[Feast of Orthodoxy]] service, along with [[Pugachev]], [[Stenka Razin|Razin]] and [[False Dmitry I]]. Later, a positive view of Mazepa was taboo in the [[Soviet Union]] and considered as a sign of \"Ukrainian [[bourgeois nationalism]]\". During the years of [[Perestroika]], however, many historical works saw light that viewed Mazepa differently. After [[Ukraine]]'s independence in 1991, Mazepa was proclaimed a national hero in Ukraine's official historiography and mainstream media,{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} as he was the first post-Pereyaslav Treaty hetman to take a stand against the Tsar, who failed to abide by the Treaty.

{"title_page": "Fascism and ideology", "text_new": "{{fascism sidebar}}\n[[File:Propaganda.JPG|thumb|A Fascist propaganda poster featuring the [[Duce]] of Italy]]\nThe history of '''fascist ideology''' is long and it also involves many sources. Fascists took inspiration from sources as ancient as the [[Sparta]]ns for their focus on [[Racial hygiene|racial purity]] and their emphasis on rule by an elite minority. [[Fascism]] has also been connected to the ideals of [[Plato]], though there are key differences between the two. Fascism styled itself as the ideological successor to [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], particularly the [[Roman Empire]]. The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]-era concept of a \"high and noble\" [[Aryan]] culture {{Dubious|date=November 2017}} as opposed to a \"parasitic\" [[Semitic culture]] was core to [[Nazism|Nazi]] racial views. From the same era, [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]'s view on the absolute authority of the state also strongly influenced Fascist thinking. The [[French Revolution]] was a major influence insofar as the Nazis saw themselves as fighting back against many of the ideas which it brought to prominence, especially [[liberalism]], [[liberal democracy]] and [[racial equality]], whereas on the other hand Fascism drew heavily on the revolutionary ideal of [[nationalism]]. Common themes among fascist movements include; [[nationalism]] (including [[racial nationalism]]), [[hierarchy]] and [[elitism]], [[militarism]], [[Secular religion|quasi-religion]], [[masculinity]] and [[Voluntarism (philosophy)|voluntarism]]. Other aspects of fascism such as its \"myth of decadence\", anti\u2010egalitarianism and [[totalitarianism]] can be seen to originate from these ideas. These fundamental aspects however, can be attributed to a concept known as \"[[Palingenetic ultranationalism]]\", a theory proposed by [[Roger Griffin]], that fascism is a synthesis of totalitarianism and ultranationalism sacralized through myth of national rebirth and regeneration.\n\nIts relationship with other ideologies of its day was complex, often at once adversarial and focused on co-opting their more popular aspects. Fascists supported [[private property]] rights for Aryans and the [[profit motive]] of [[capitalism]], but sought to eliminate the autonomy of large-scale capitalism by bolstering private power with the state. They shared many of the goals of the [[conservatism|conservatives]] of their day and often allied themselves with them by drawing recruits from disaffected conservative ranks, but presented themselves as holding a more [[Modernism|modern]] ideology, with less focus on things like traditional [[religion]]. Fascism opposed the egalitarian ([[V\u00f6lkisch equality]]) and international character of mainstream [[socialism]], but sometimes sought to establish itself as an alternative [[Nazism|\"national\" socialism]]. It strongly opposed liberalism, [[communism]], [[anarchism]], and [[democratic socialism]].\n\n==Ideological origins==\n\n===Early influences (495 BC\u20131880 AD)===\n[[File:Hoplit.png|thumb|Depiction of a Greek Hoplite warrior, as ancient Sparta has been considered an inspiration for fascist and quasi-fascist movements, such as to [[Nazism]] and quasi-fascist [[Metaxism]]]]\nEarly influences that shaped the ideology of fascism have been dated back to [[Ancient Greece]].

Herder argued that the Germanic peoples held close racial connections with the ancient Indians and ancient Persians, who he claimed were advanced peoples possessing a great capacity for wisdom, nobility, restraint and science.{{sfn|Blamires|2006|p=62}} Contemporaries of Herder utilized the concept of the Aryan race to draw a distinction between what they deemed \"high and noble\" Aryan culture versus that of \"parasitic\" Semitic culture and this anti-Semitic variant view of Europeans' Aryan roots formed the basis of Nazi racial views.{{sfn|Blamires|2006|p=62}} Another major influence on fascism came from the political theories of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]].<ref name=\"Contemporary Political Theory 2007.

Hungarian fascist [[Gyula G\u00f6mb\u00f6s]] rose to power as Prime Minister of [[Hungary]] in 1932 and visited Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany in order to consolidate good relations with the two regimes.

In 1941, the Axis campaign spread to the Soviet Union after Hitler launched [[Operation Barbarossa]]. Axis forces at the height of their power controlled almost all of continental Europe. By 1942, Nazi Germany annexed Poland to Germany and controlled vast sections of continental Europe, including the occupation of large portions of the [[Soviet Union]]. By 1942, Fascist Italy occupied and annexed [[Dalmatia]] from Yugoslavia, Corsica and [[Nice]] from France and controlled other territories. During World War II, the [[Axis Powers]] in Europe led by Nazi Germany participated in the extermination of millions of Jews and others in the [[genocide]] known as the [[Holocaust]]. In [[Asia]], Japan committed large massacres of Chinese civilians.\n\nAfter 1942, Axis forces began to falter. By 1943, after Italy faced multiple military failures, complete reliance and subordination of Italy to Germany and Allied invasion of Italy and corresponding international humiliation, Mussolini was removed as head of government and arrested by the order of King Victor Emmanuel III who proceeded to dismantle the Fascist state and declared Italy's switching of allegiance to the Allied side. Mussolini was rescued from arrest by German forces and led the German client state, the [[Italian Social Republic]] from 1943 to 1945.

After World War II and a period of international isolation, Franco's regime normalized relations with Western powers during the early years of the Cold War until Franco's death in 1975 and the transformation of Spain into a liberal democracy.\n \n[[Peronism]], which is associated with the regime of [[Juan Peron]] in [[Argentina]] from 1946 to 1955 and 1973 to 1974, was strongly influenced by fascism.{{sfn|Blamires|2006|p=512}} Prior to rising to power, from 1939 to 1941 Peron had developed a deep admiration of Italian Fascism and modelled his economic policies on Italian Fascist economic policies.{{sfn|Blamires|2006|p=512}}\n\nThe South African government of [[Afrikaner nationalism|Afrikaner nationalist]] and [[White supremacy|white supremacist]] [[Daniel Fran\u00e7ois Malan]] was closely associated with pro-fascist and pro-Nazi politics.{{sfn|Payne|1996|p=338}} In 1937, Malan's Purified National Party, the South African Fascists and the Blackshirts agreed to form a coalition for the South African election.{{sfn|Payne|1996|p=338}} Malan had fiercely opposed South Africa's participation on the Allied side in World War II.{{sfn|Griffin|1991|p=159}} Malan's government founded [[apartheid]], the system of [[racial segregation]] of whites and non-whites in [[South Africa]].{{sfn|Payne|1996|p=338}} The most extreme Afrikaner fascist movement is the neo-Nazi white supremacist [[Afrikaner Resistance Movement]] (AWB) that at one point was recorded in 1991 to have 50,000 supporters with rising support.{{sfn|Griffin|1991|p=160}} The AWB grew in support in response to efforts to dismantle apartheid in the 1980s and early 1990s and its paramilitary wing the [[Storm Falcons]] threatened violence against people it considered \"trouble makers\".{{sfn|Griffin|1991|p=160}}\n\n[[File:Baath Party founder Michel Aflaq with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in 1988.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ba'ath Party]] founder [[Michel Aflaq]] (left) with Iraqi President [[Saddam Hussein]] (right) in 1988, as both of Ba'athism's key ideologists [[Michel Aflaq]] and [[Zaki al-Arsuzi]] were directly inspired by Fascism and Nazism]]\nAnother ideology strongly influenced by fascism is [[Ba'athism]].{{sfn|Blamires|2006|p=82-84}} Ba'athism is a revolutionary [[Arab nationalism|Arab nationalist]] ideology that seeks the unification of all claimed Arab lands into a single Arab state.{{sfn|Blamires|2006|p=82-84}} [[Zaki al-Arsuzi]], one of the principal founders of Ba'athism, was strongly influenced by and supportive of Fascism and Nazism.<ref>Curtis, Michel (1971).

He argued: \n<blockquote>I do not intend to defend capitalism or capitalists. They, like everything human, have their defects. I only say their possibilities of usefulness are not ended. Capitalism has borne the monstrous burden of the war and today still has the strength to shoulder the burdens of peace. ...

Schlesinger, Jr.]] saw little conservative influence within fascist ideology or its movement, writing: \"Fascists were not conservative in any very meaningful sense\u2026 The Fascists, in a meaningful sense, were revolutionaries\".<ref>Arthur M.

Fascism and political theory: critical perspectives on fascist ideology. Oxon, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2010. Pp. 24.</ref> The conservative authoritarian right is distinguished from fascism in that such conservatives utilized traditional religion as the basis for their views while fascists based their views on more complex issues such as [[vitalism]], [[Irrationalism|nonrationalism]] or secular neo-idealism.{{sfn|Payne|1996|p=16}}\n\nMany of fascism's recruits were disaffected [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] conservatives who were dissatisfied with the traditional right's inability to achieve national unity and its inability to respond to socialism, feminism, economic crisis and international difficulties.<ref>Kevin Passmore.

Chapter 6.</ref>\n\n===Liberalism===\nFascism is strongly opposed to the individualism found in classical liberalism. Fascists accuse liberalism as being the cause of despiritualization of human beings and transforming them into materialistic beings in which the highest ideal is moneymaking.<ref name=\"massaschussetts1\">Marvin Perry, Myrna Chase, Margaret Jacob, James R. Jacob. ''WESTERN CIVILIZATION: IDEAS, POLITICS, AND SOCIETY- FROM 1600, Volume 2''. 9th ed. Boston, Massaschussetts, USA: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company, 2009 Pp. 760.</ref> In particular, fascism opposes liberalism for its [[materialism]], [[rationalism]], [[individualism]] and [[utilitarianism]].{{sfn|Sternhell|1994|p=7}} Fascists believe that the liberal emphasis on individual freedom produces national divisiveness.<ref name=\"massaschussetts1\"/> Mussolini directed his criticism not against modern, Keynesian liberalism, but the older form of [[classical liberalism]], due to its individualistic nature, writing: \"Against individualism, the Fascist conception is for the State; ... It is opposed to classical Liberalism ... Liberalism denied the State in the interests of the particular individual; Fascism reaffirms the State as the true reality of the individual\".<ref>\"[[The Doctrine of Fascism]]\", Firenze: Vallecchi Editore (1935 version), p. 13</ref> However, Fascists and Nazis support a type of hierarchical individualism in the form of [[Social Darwinism]] because they believe it promotes \"superior individuals\" and weeds out \"the weak\".<ref>Alexander J. De Grand, ''Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany'', Routledge, 1995. pp. 47</ref> They also accused both Marxism and democracy, with their emphasis on equality, of destroying individuality in favor of the \"dead weight\" of the masses.<ref>Lorna Waddington, (2007) Hitler's Crusade: Bolshevism and the Myth of the International Jewish Conspiracy. I.B.Tauris. pp. 17.</ref>\n\nOne issue where Fascism is in accord with liberalism is in its support of [[private property]] rights and the existence of a [[market economy]].{{sfn|Sternhell|1994|p=7}} Although Fascism sought to \"destroy the existing political order\", it had tentatively adopted the economic elements of liberalism, but \"completely denied its philosophical principles and the intellectual and moral heritage of modernity\".{{sfn|Sternhell|1994|p=7}} Due to the economic hardships that resulted from \"War Communism\", which almost toppled the leadership of Soviet Russia in 1921, fascists in Germany and Italy followed the examples of [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]]'s [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP), which had endorsed \"state capitalism\" and permitted the public to trade, buy and sell for \"private profit\".<ref>V. N. Bandera \"New Economic Policy (NEP) as an Economic System,\" ''The Journal of Political Economy'', Vol. 71, No. 3 (June, 1963), 265-79: p. 268</ref> Although the [[Bolsheviks]] were averse to the principles of open markets and profit, they were nonetheless forced by dire circumstances to allow \"privatization and private initiative\" that resulted in a Soviet \"mixed economy\".<ref>[[L.K. Samuels]], \"The Socialist Economics of Italian Fascism,\" ''Library of Economics and Liberty'', July 6, 2015</ref><ref>Kenez, Peter, ''A History of the Soviet Union from the Beginning to the End'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006, pp. 47\u201348</ref> For fascist leaders, following the two economic pillars of Fascism \u2014 \"productionism\" and \"syndicalism\"{{sfn|Payne|1996|p=224}} \u2014 was more important than adhering to ideological commitments that could risk economic collapse and mass unemployment that had plagued Lenin's nationalization policies. Moreover, Fascism espoused antimaterialism, which meant that it rejected the \"rationalistic, individualistic and utilitarian heritage\" that defined the liberal-centric [[Age of Enlightenment]].{{sfn|Sternhell|1994|p=7}}\n\n===Social welfare and public works===\nBoth National Socialist Germany and Fascist Italy were [[welfare state]]s that spent heavily on public works. A former school teacher, Mussolini's spending on the public sector, schools and infrastructure was considered extravagant. Mussolini \"instituted a programme of public works hitherto unrivalled in modern Europe. Bridges, canals, and roads were built, hospitals and schools, railway stations and orphanages; swamps were drained and land reclaimed, forests were planted and universities were endowed\".<ref>[[Christopher Hibbert]], ''Benito Mussolini: A Biography'', Geneva: Switzerland, Heron Books, 1962, p. 56</ref> As for the scope and spending of social welfare programs, Italian fascism \"compared favorably with the more advanced European nations and in some respect was more progressive\".{{sfn|Gregor|1979|p=263}} When New York City politician [[Grover Aloysius Whalen]] asked Mussolini about the meaning behind Italian Fascism in 1939, the reply was: \"It is like your New Deal!\".<ref> [[Grover Aloysius Whalen]], ''Mr. New York: The Autobiography of Grover A. Whalen'', G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1955, p. 188</ref>\n\nBy 1925, the Fascist government had \"embarked upon an elaborate program\" that included food supplementary assistance, infant care, maternity assistance, general healthcare, wage supplements, paid vacations, unemployment benefits, illness insurance, occupational disease insurance, general family assistance, public housing and old age and disability insurance.{{sfn|Gregor|1979|p=258-264}} As for public works, the Mussolini administration \"devoted 400 million lire of public monies\" for school construction between 1922 and 1942, compared to only 60 million lire between 1862 and 1922.{{sfn|Gregor|1979|p=260}}\n\nHitler and the German National Socialists spent large amounts of state revenues for a comprehensive social welfare system to combat the ill effects of the Great Depression, promising repeatedly throughout his regime the \"creation of a socially just state\".<ref>Hitler's speech to workers at Berlin's Rheinmetall-Borsig factory, Oct. 10, 1940. Published in [[G\u00f6tz Aly]], ''Hitler's Beneficiaries: Plunder, Racial War, and the Nazi Welfare State'', New York: NY, Metropolitan Books, 2007, p. 13</ref> In 1933, Hitler ordered the [[Nationalsozialistische Volkswohlfahrt | National Socialist People's Welfare]] (NSV) chairman [[Erich Hilgenfeldt]] to \"see to the disbanding of all private welfare institutions\" in an effort to socially engineer society by selecting who was to receive social benefits.<ref>Martina Steber and Bernhard Gotto, ''Visions of Community in Nazi Germany: Social Engineering and Private Lives'', Oxford: UK, Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 92, p 2.</ref> Under this state-operated welfare structure, Nazi administrators were able to mount an effort towards the \"cleansing of their cities of 'asocials'\".<ref>Michael Geyer, Sheila Fitzpatrick, ''Beyond Totalitarianism: Stalinism and Nazism Compared'', Cambridge University Press, 2009, p. 147</ref> Nonetheless, the NSV instituted expansive programs to address the socio-economic inequalities among those deemed to be German citizens. [[Joseph Goebbels]] remarked about the merits of Hitler's welfare state in a 1944 editorial \"Our Socialism\", where he professed: \"We and we alone [the Nazis] have the best social welfare measures. Everything is done for the nation\".<ref>Victor Klemperer, ''I Will Bear Witness: A Diary of the Nazi Years, 1942-1945'', Vol. 2, Random House, Inc., 2001, p. 317. Goebbels' \"Our Socialism\" editorial was written on April 30, 1944</ref>\n\nWith 17 million Germans receiving assistance under the auspices of National Socialist People's Welfare (NSV) by 1939, the agency \"projected a powerful image of caring and support\".<ref name=Evans>[[Richard J. Evans]], ''The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939'', New York: NY, The Penguin Press, 2005, p. 489</ref> The National Socialists provided a plethora of social welfare programs under Nazi's concept of [[Volksgemeinschaft]] which promoted the collectivity of a \"people's community\" where citizens would sacrifice themselves for the greater good. The NSV operated \"8,000 day-nurseries\" by 1939 and funded holiday homes for mothers, distributed additional food for large families and was involved with a \"wide variety of other facilities\".<ref name=Evans/>\n \nThe Nazi social welfare provisions included old age insurance, rent supplements, unemployment and disability benefits, old-age homes, interest-free loans for married couples, along with healthcare insurance, which was not decreed mandatory until 1941.<ref>[[G\u00f6tz Aly]], ''Hitler's Beneficiaries: Plunder, Racial War, and the Nazi Welfare State'', New York: NY, Metropolitan Books, 2007, p. 50.</ref> One of the NSV branches, the Office of Institutional and Special Welfare, was responsible \"for travellers' aid at railway stations; relief for ex-convicts; 'support' for re-migrants from abroad; assistance for the physically disabled, hard-of-hearing, deaf, mute, and blind; relief for the elderly, homeless and alcoholics; and the fight against illicit drugs and epidemics\".<ref> Martina Steber and Bernhard Gotto, ''Visions of Community in Nazi Germany: Social Engineering and Private Lives'', Oxford: UK, Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 93</ref> The Office of Youth Relief, which had 30,000 branches offices by 1941, took the job of supervising \"social workers, corrective training, mediation assistance\" and dealing with judicial authorities to prevent juvenile delinquency.<ref> Martina Steber and Bernhard Gotto, ''Visions of Community in Nazi Germany: Social Engineering and Private Lives'', Oxford: UK, Oxford University Press, 2014, pp. 93-94</ref>\n\n===Socialism and communism===\nFascism is historically strongly opposed to [[socialism]] and [[communism]], due to their support of [[Class conflict|class revolution]] as well as \"decadent\" values, including [[internationalism (politics)|internationalism]], [[egalitarianism]], horizontal [[collectivism]], [[materialism]] and [[cosmopolitanism]].{{sfn|Blamires|2006|p=610}}{{sfn|Blamires|2006|p=404}} Fascists have thus commonly campaigned with [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] agendas.{{sfn|Blamires|2006|p=96}} Fascism opposed the [[Internationalist/Defencist Schism|international]] character of mainstream [[socialism]], but in opposing this international character, it often defined itself as a \"nationalist\" form of socialism, an alternative to the mainstream form of socialism which it regarded as its bitter enemy.{{sfn|Blamires|2006|p=610}} Hitler at times attempted to redefine the word socialism, such as saying: \"Socialism! That is an unfortunate word altogether... What does socialism really mean? If people have something to eat and their pleasures, then they have their socialism\".<ref>Henry A. Turner, ''\"German Big Business and the Rise of Hitler\"'', Oxford University Press, 1985. pg 77</ref> In 1930, Hitler said: \"Our adopted term 'Socialist' has nothing to do with Marxist Socialism. Marxism is anti-property; true Socialism is not\".<ref>Carsten, Francis Ludwig ''The Rise of Fascism'', 2nd ed. University of California Press, 1982. p. 137. Quoting: Hitler, A., Sunday Express, September 28, 1930.</ref> The name that Hitler later wished he had used to describe his political party was \"social revolutionary\".<ref>[[Konrad Heiden]], ''A History of National Socialism'', vol. 2, New York: NY, Rutledge, 2010, p. 85. First published in 1934.</ref> [[Nikita Khrushchev]] sardonically remarked: \"In modern times the word Socialism has become very fashionable, and it has also been used very loosely. Even Hitler used to babble about Socialism, and he worked the word into the name of his Nazi [National Socialist] party. The whole world knows what sort of Socialism Hitler had in mind\".<ref>Crankshaw, Edward (1970). ''Khrushchev Remembers''. p. 433.</ref>\n\nMainstream socialists have typically rejected and opposed fascism in turn.{{sfn|Blamires|2006|p=610}} Many communists regarded fascism as a tool of the ruling-class to destroy the working-class, regarding it as \"the open but indirect dictatorship of capital.\" However, the agency and genuine belief of fascists was recognised by some communist writers, like Antonio Gramsci, Palmiro Togliatti and Otto Bauer, who instead believed fascism to be a genuine mass movement that arose as a consequence of the specific socio-economic conditions of the societies it arose in.<ref>Payne, S.G., 1996. A history of fascism, 1914\u20131945. University of Wisconsin Pres, pp.124-128</ref> Despite the mutual antagonism that would later develop between the two, the attitude of communists towards early fascism was more ambivalent than it might appear from the writings of individual communist theorists. Fascism was, in the early days, sometimes perceived as less of a mortal rival to revolutionary Marxism than as a heresy from it. Mussolini's government was one of the first in Western Europe to diplomatically recognise the USSR, doing so in 1924. On June 20th 1923, Karl Radek gave a speech before the Comintern in which he proposed a common front with the Nazis in Germany. However, the two radicalisms were mutually exclusive and they later become profound enemies.<ref>Payne, S.G., 1996. A history of fascism, 1914\u20131945.

Fascists took inspiration from sources as ancient as the [[Sparta]]ns for their focus on [[Racial hygiene|racial purity]] and their emphasis on rule by an elite minority. [[Fascism]] has also been connected to the ideals of [[Plato]], though there are key differences between the two. Fascism styled itself as the ideological successor to [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], particularly the [[Roman Empire]]. The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]-era concept of a \"high and noble\" [[Aryan]] culture {{Dubious|date=November 2017}} as opposed to a \"parasitic\" [[Semitic culture]] was core to [[Nazism|Nazi]] racial views. From the same era, [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]'s view on the absolute authority of the state also strongly influenced Fascist thinking. The [[French Revolution]] was a major influence insofar as the Nazis saw themselves as fighting back against many of the ideas which it brought to prominence, especially [[liberalism]], [[liberal democracy]] and [[racial equality]], whereas on the other hand Fascism drew heavily on the revolutionary ideal of [[nationalism]]. Common themes among fascist movements include; [[nationalism]] (including [[racial nationalism]]), [[hierarchy]] and [[elitism]], [[militarism]], [[Secular religion|quasi-religion]], [[masculinity]] and [[Voluntarism (philosophy)|voluntarism]]. Other aspects of fascism such as its \"myth of decadence\", anti\u2010egalitarianism and [[totalitarianism]] can be seen to originate from these ideas. These fundamental aspects however, can be attributed to a concept known as \"[[Palingenetic ultranationalism]]\", a theory proposed by [[Roger Griffin]], that fascism is a synthesis of totalitarianism and ultranationalism sacralized through myth of national rebirth and regeneration.\n\nIts relationship with other ideologies of its day was complex, often at once adversarial and focused on co-opting their more popular aspects. Fascists supported [[private property]] rights for Aryans and the [[profit motive]] of [[capitalism]], but sought to eliminate the autonomy of large-scale capitalism by bolstering private power with the state. They shared many of the goals of the [[conservatism|conservatives]] of their day and often allied themselves with them by drawing recruits from disaffected conservative ranks, but presented themselves as holding a more [[Modernism|modern]] ideology, with less focus on things like traditional [[religion]]. Fascism opposed the egalitarian ([[V\u00f6lkisch equality]]) and international character of mainstream [[socialism]], but sometimes sought to establish itself as an alternative [[Nazism|\"national\" socialism]]. It strongly opposed liberalism, [[communism]], [[anarchism]], and [[democratic socialism]].\n\n==Ideological origins==\n\n===Early influences (495 BC\u20131880 AD)===\n[[File:Hoplit.png|thumb|Depiction of a Greek Hoplite warrior, as ancient Sparta has been considered an inspiration for fascist and quasi-fascist movements, such as to [[Nazism]] and quasi-fascist [[Metaxism]]]]\nEarly influences that shaped the ideology of fascism have been dated back to [[Ancient Greece]].

The development of the study of universal histories by [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] resulted in Herder's analysis of the development of nations, Herder developed the term ''Nationalismus'' (\"nationalism\") to describe this cultural phenomenon. At this time nationalism did not refer to the political ideology of nationalism that was later developed during the [[French Revolution]].<ref name=Motyl>Alexander J. Motyl. ''Encyclopedia of Nationalism'', Volume 1: Fundamental Themes. San Diego, California, USA; London, England, UK: Academic Press, 2001. Pp. 341-343.</ref> Herder also developed the theory that Europeans are the descendants of [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan people]] based on language studies. Herder argued that the Germanic peoples held close racial connections with the ancient Indians and ancient Persians, who he claimed were advanced peoples possessing a great capacity for wisdom, nobility, restraint and science.{{sfn|Blamires|2006|p=62}} Contemporaries of Herder utilized the concept of the Aryan race to draw a distinction between what they deemed \"high and noble\" Aryan culture versus that of \"parasitic\" Semitic culture and this anti-Semitic variant view of Europeans' Aryan roots formed the basis of Nazi racial views.{{sfn|Blamires|2006|p=62}} Another major influence on fascism came from the political theories of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]].<ref name=\"Contemporary Political Theory 2007. Pp. 705\"/> Hegel promoted the absolute authority of the state<ref name=\"Contemporary Political Theory 2007.

Pp. 706\"/>\n\nThe French Revolution and its political legacy had a major influence upon the development of fascism. Fascists view the French Revolution as a largely negative event that resulted in the entrenchment of liberal ideas such as [[liberal democracy]], [[anticlericalism]] and [[rationalism]].{{sfn|Blamires|2006|p=257}} Opponents of the French Revolution initially were conservatives and reactionaries, but the Revolution was also later criticized by Marxists for its bourgeois character and racist nationalists who opposed its universalist principles.{{sfn|Blamires|2006|p=257}} Racist nationalists in particular condemned the French Revolution for granting social equality to \"inferior races\" such as [[Jews]].{{sfn|Blamires|2006|p=257}} Mussolini condemned the French Revolution for developing liberalism, [[scientific socialism]] and liberal democracy, but also acknowledged that fascism extracted and utilized all the elements that had preserved those ideologies' vitality and that fascism had no desire to restore the conditions that precipitated the French Revolution.{{sfn|Blamires|2006|p=257}} Though fascism opposed core parts of the Revolution, fascists supported other aspects of it, Mussolini declared his support for the Revolution's demolishment of remnants of the Middle Ages such as tolls and compulsory labour upon citizens and he noted that the French Revolution did have benefits in that it had been a cause of the whole French nation and not merely a political party.{{sfn|Blamires|2006|p=257}} Most importantly, the French Revolution was responsible for the entrenchment of nationalism as a political ideology \u2013 both in its development in France as [[French nationalism]] and in the creation of nationalist movements particularly in Germany with the development of [[German nationalism]] by [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] as a political response to the development of French nationalism.<ref name=Motyl/> The Nazis accused the French Revolution of being dominated by Jews and [[Freemasons]] and were deeply disturbed by the Revolution's intention to completely break France away from its past history in what the Nazis claimed was a repudiation of history that they asserted to be a trait of the Enlightenment.{{sfn|Blamires|2006|p=257}} Though the Nazis were highly critical of the Revolution, Hitler in ''Mein Kampf'' said that the French Revolution is a model for how to achieve change that he claims was caused by the rhetorical strength of demagogues.{{sfn|Blamires|2006|p=258}} Furthermore, the Nazis idealized the ''[[lev\u00e9e en masse]]'' ([[mass mobilization]] of soldiers) that was developed by French Revolutionary armies and the Nazis sought to use the system for their paramilitary movement.{{sfn|Blamires|2006|p=258}}\n\n===''Fin de si\u00e8cle'' era and the fusion of nationalism with Sorelianism (1880\u20131914)===\n{{Fin de siecle sidebar}}\nThe ideological roots of fascism have been traced to the 1880s and in particular the ''[[fin de si\u00e8cle]]'' theme of that time.<ref name=\"Sternhell 1998\">Sternhell, Zeev, \"Crisis of Fin-de-si\u00e8cle Thought\" in Griffin, Roger, ed., ''International Fascism: Theories, Causes and the New Consensus'' (London and New York, 1998) p. 169-171.</ref>{{sfn|Payne|1996|p=23-24}} The theme was based on revolt against [[materialism]], [[rationalism]], [[positivism]], bourgeois society and [[liberal democracy]].<ref name=\"Sternhell 1998\"/> The ''fin-de-si\u00e8cle'' generation supported [[emotionalism (disorder)|emotionalism]], [[irrationalism]], [[subjectivism]] and [[vitalism]].{{sfn|Payne|1996|p=24}} The ''fin-de-si\u00e8cle'' mindset saw civilization as being in a crisis that required a massive and total solution.<ref name=\"Sternhell 1998\"/> The ''fin-de-si\u00e8cle'' intellectual school of the 1890s \u2013 including [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]] and [[Enrico Corradini]] in Italy; [[Maurice Barr\u00e8s]], [[Edouard Drumont]] and [[Georges Sorel]] in France; and [[Paul de Lagarde]], [[Julius Langbehn]] and [[Arthur Moeller van den Bruck]] in Germany \u2013 saw social and political collectivity as more important than [[individualism]] and rationalism.

Mussolini was aware that Italy did not have the military capacity to carry out a long war with [[France]] or the [[United Kingdom]] and waited until France was on the verge of imminent collapse and surrender from German invasion before declaring war on France and the United Kingdom on 10 June 1940 on the assumption that the war would be short-lived following France's collapse.<ref name=Knox>MacGregor Knox.

The war became prolonged contrary to Mussolini's plans resulting in Italy losing battles on multiple fronts and requiring German assistance. In 1941, the Axis campaign spread to the Soviet Union after Hitler launched [[Operation Barbarossa]]. Axis forces at the height of their power controlled almost all of continental Europe. By 1942, Nazi Germany annexed Poland to Germany and controlled vast sections of continental Europe, including the occupation of large portions of the [[Soviet Union]]. By 1942, Fascist Italy occupied and annexed [[Dalmatia]] from Yugoslavia, Corsica and [[Nice]] from France and controlled other territories. During World War II, the [[Axis Powers]] in Europe led by Nazi Germany participated in the extermination of millions of Jews and others in the [[genocide]] known as the [[Holocaust]]. In [[Asia]], Japan committed large massacres of Chinese civilians.\n\nAfter 1942, Axis forces began to falter. By 1943, after Italy faced multiple military failures, complete reliance and subordination of Italy to Germany and Allied invasion of Italy and corresponding international humiliation, Mussolini was removed as head of government and arrested by the order of King Victor Emmanuel III who proceeded to dismantle the Fascist state and declared Italy's switching of allegiance to the Allied side. Mussolini was rescued from arrest by German forces and led the German client state, the [[Italian Social Republic]] from 1943 to 1945. Nazi Germany faced multiple losses and steady Soviet and Western Allied offensives from 1943 to 1945.\n\n[[File:Inmate at the Rab concentration camp.jpg|thumb|[[Emaciation|Emaciated]] male inmate at the Italian [[Rab concentration camp]]]]\nOn 28 April 1945, Mussolini was captured and executed by Italian communist partisans who had his body and those of others executed displayed on a meat hook in front of crowds who celebrated his execution.

The [[Nuremberg Trials]] convicted multiple Nazi leaders of crimes against humanity involving the Holocaust. However, there remained multiple ideologies and governments that were ideologically related to fascism.\n\n[[Francisco Franco]]'s [[Falangism|Falangist]] one-party state in Spain was officially neutral during World War II and survived the collapse of the Axis Powers. Franco's rise to power had been directly assisted by the militaries of Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany during the [[Spanish Civil War]] and had sent volunteers to fight on the side of Nazi Germany against the Soviet Union during World War II. After World War II and a period of international isolation, Franco's regime normalized relations with Western powers during the early years of the Cold War until Franco's death in 1975 and the transformation of Spain into a liberal democracy.\n \n[[Peronism]], which is associated with the regime of [[Juan Peron]] in [[Argentina]] from 1946 to 1955 and 1973 to 1974, was strongly influenced by fascism.{{sfn|Blamires|2006|p=512}} Prior to rising to power, from 1939 to 1941 Peron had developed a deep admiration of Italian Fascism and modelled his economic policies on Italian Fascist economic policies.{{sfn|Blamires|2006|p=512}}\n\nThe South African government of [[Afrikaner nationalism|Afrikaner nationalist]] and [[White supremacy|white supremacist]] [[Daniel Fran\u00e7ois Malan]] was closely associated with pro-fascist and pro-Nazi politics.{{sfn|Payne|1996|p=338}} In 1937, Malan's Purified National Party, the South African Fascists and the Blackshirts agreed to form a coalition for the South African election.{{sfn|Payne|1996|p=338}} Malan had fiercely opposed South Africa's participation on the Allied side in World War II.{{sfn|Griffin|1991|p=159}} Malan's government founded [[apartheid]], the system of [[racial segregation]] of whites and non-whites in [[South Africa]].{{sfn|Payne|1996|p=338}} The most extreme Afrikaner fascist movement is the neo-Nazi white supremacist [[Afrikaner Resistance Movement]] (AWB) that at one point was recorded in 1991 to have 50,000 supporters with rising support.{{sfn|Griffin|1991|p=160}} The AWB grew in support in response to efforts to dismantle apartheid in the 1980s and early 1990s and its paramilitary wing the [[Storm Falcons]] threatened violence against people it considered \"trouble makers\".{{sfn|Griffin|1991|p=160}}\n\n[[File:Baath Party founder Michel Aflaq with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in 1988.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ba'ath Party]] founder [[Michel Aflaq]] (left) with Iraqi President [[Saddam Hussein]] (right) in 1988, as both of Ba'athism's key ideologists [[Michel Aflaq]] and [[Zaki al-Arsuzi]] were directly inspired by Fascism and Nazism]]\nAnother ideology strongly influenced by fascism is [[Ba'athism]].{{sfn|Blamires|2006|p=82-84}} Ba'athism is a revolutionary [[Arab nationalism|Arab nationalist]] ideology that seeks the unification of all claimed Arab lands into a single Arab state.{{sfn|Blamires|2006|p=82-84}} [[Zaki al-Arsuzi]], one of the principal founders of Ba'athism, was strongly influenced by and supportive of Fascism and Nazism.<ref>Curtis, Michel (1971).

He argued: \n<blockquote>I do not intend to defend capitalism or capitalists. They, like everything human, have their defects. I only say their possibilities of usefulness are not ended. Capitalism has borne the monstrous burden of the war and today still has the strength to shoulder the burdens of peace. ... It is not simply and solely an accumulation of wealth, it is an elaboration, a selection, a co-ordination of values which is the work of centuries. ...

Chapter 6.</ref>\n\n===Liberalism===\nFascism is strongly opposed to the individualism found in classical liberalism. Fascists accuse liberalism as being the cause of despiritualization of human beings and transforming them into materialistic beings in which the highest ideal is moneymaking.<ref name=\"massaschussetts1\">Marvin Perry, Myrna Chase, Margaret Jacob, James R. Jacob. ''WESTERN CIVILIZATION: IDEAS, POLITICS, AND SOCIETY- FROM 1600, Volume 2''. 9th ed. Boston, Massaschussetts, USA: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company, 2009 Pp. 760.</ref> In particular, fascism opposes liberalism for its [[materialism]], [[rationalism]], [[individualism]] and [[utilitarianism]].{{sfn|Sternhell|1994|p=7}} Fascists believe that the liberal emphasis on individual freedom produces national divisiveness.<ref name=\"massaschussetts1\"/> Mussolini directed his criticism not against modern, Keynesian liberalism, but the older form of [[classical liberalism]], due to its individualistic nature, writing: \"Against individualism, the Fascist conception is for the State; ... It is opposed to classical Liberalism ... Liberalism denied the State in the interests of the particular individual; Fascism reaffirms the State as the true reality of the individual\".<ref>\"[[The Doctrine of Fascism]]\", Firenze: Vallecchi Editore (1935 version), p. 13</ref> However, Fascists and Nazis support a type of hierarchical individualism in the form of [[Social Darwinism]] because they believe it promotes \"superior individuals\" and weeds out \"the weak\".<ref>Alexander J. De Grand, ''Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany'', Routledge, 1995. pp. 47</ref> They also accused both Marxism and democracy, with their emphasis on equality, of destroying individuality in favor of the \"dead weight\" of the masses.<ref>Lorna Waddington, (2007) Hitler's Crusade: Bolshevism and the Myth of the International Jewish Conspiracy. I.B.Tauris. pp. 17.</ref>\n\nOne issue where Fascism is in accord with liberalism is in its support of [[private property]] rights and the existence of a [[market economy]].{{sfn|Sternhell|1994|p=7}} Although Fascism sought to \"destroy the existing political order\", it had tentatively adopted the economic elements of liberalism, but \"completely denied its philosophical principles and the intellectual and moral heritage of modernity\".{{sfn|Sternhell|1994|p=7}} Due to the economic hardships that resulted from \"War Communism\", which almost toppled the leadership of Soviet Russia in 1921, fascists in Germany and Italy followed the examples of [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]]'s [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP), which had endorsed \"state capitalism\" and permitted the public to trade, buy and sell for \"private profit\".<ref>V. N. Bandera \"New Economic Policy (NEP) as an Economic System,\" ''The Journal of Political Economy'', Vol. 71, No. 3 (June, 1963), 265-79: p. 268</ref> Although the [[Bolsheviks]] were averse to the principles of open markets and profit, they were nonetheless forced by dire circumstances to allow \"privatization and private initiative\" that resulted in a Soviet \"mixed economy\".<ref>[[L.K.

Moreover, Fascism espoused antimaterialism, which meant that it rejected the \"rationalistic, individualistic and utilitarian heritage\" that defined the liberal-centric [[Age of Enlightenment]].{{sfn|Sternhell|1994|p=7}}\n\n===Social welfare and public works===\nBoth National Socialist Germany and Fascist Italy were [[welfare state]]s that spent heavily on public works. A former school teacher, Mussolini's spending on the public sector, schools and infrastructure was considered extravagant. Mussolini \"instituted a programme of public works hitherto unrivalled in modern Europe. Bridges, canals, and roads were built, hospitals and schools, railway stations and orphanages; swamps were drained and land reclaimed, forests were planted and universities were endowed\".<ref>[[Christopher Hibbert]], ''Benito Mussolini: A Biography'', Geneva: Switzerland, Heron Books, 1962, p. 56</ref> As for the scope and spending of social welfare programs, Italian fascism \"compared favorably with the more advanced European nations and in some respect was more progressive\".{{sfn|Gregor|1979|p=263}} When New York City politician [[Grover Aloysius Whalen]] asked Mussolini about the meaning behind Italian Fascism in 1939, the reply was: \"It is like your New Deal!\".<ref> [[Grover Aloysius Whalen]], ''Mr. New York: The Autobiography of Grover A. Whalen'', G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1955, p. 188</ref>\n\nBy 1925, the Fascist government had \"embarked upon an elaborate program\" that included food supplementary assistance, infant care, maternity assistance, general healthcare, wage supplements, paid vacations, unemployment benefits, illness insurance, occupational disease insurance, general family assistance, public housing and old age and disability insurance.{{sfn|Gregor|1979|p=258-264}} As for public works, the Mussolini administration \"devoted 400 million lire of public monies\" for school construction between 1922 and 1942, compared to only 60 million lire between 1862 and 1922.{{sfn|Gregor|1979|p=260}}\n\nHitler and the German National Socialists spent large amounts of state revenues for a comprehensive social welfare system to combat the ill effects of the Great Depression, promising repeatedly throughout his regime the \"creation of a socially just state\".<ref>Hitler's speech to workers at Berlin's Rheinmetall-Borsig factory, Oct. 10, 1940. Published in [[G\u00f6tz Aly]], ''Hitler's Beneficiaries: Plunder, Racial War, and the Nazi Welfare State'', New York: NY, Metropolitan Books, 2007, p. 13</ref> In 1933, Hitler ordered the [[Nationalsozialistische Volkswohlfahrt | National Socialist People's Welfare]] (NSV) chairman [[Erich Hilgenfeldt]] to \"see to the disbanding of all private welfare institutions\" in an effort to socially engineer society by selecting who was to receive social benefits.<ref>Martina Steber and Bernhard Gotto, ''Visions of Community in Nazi Germany: Social Engineering and Private Lives'', Oxford: UK, Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 92, p 2.</ref> Under this state-operated welfare structure, Nazi administrators were able to mount an effort towards the \"cleansing of their cities of 'asocials'\".<ref>Michael Geyer, Sheila Fitzpatrick, ''Beyond Totalitarianism: Stalinism and Nazism Compared'', Cambridge University Press, 2009, p. 147</ref> Nonetheless, the NSV instituted expansive programs to address the socio-economic inequalities among those deemed to be German citizens. [[Joseph Goebbels]] remarked about the merits of Hitler's welfare state in a 1944 editorial \"Our Socialism\", where he professed: \"We and we alone [the Nazis] have the best social welfare measures. Everything is done for the nation\".<ref>Victor Klemperer, ''I Will Bear Witness: A Diary of the Nazi Years, 1942-1945'', Vol. 2, Random House, Inc., 2001, p. 317. Goebbels' \"Our Socialism\" editorial was written on April 30, 1944</ref>\n\nWith 17 million Germans receiving assistance under the auspices of National Socialist People's Welfare (NSV) by 1939, the agency \"projected a powerful image of caring and support\".<ref name=Evans>[[Richard J. Evans]], ''The Third Reich in Power, 1933-1939'', New York: NY, The Penguin Press, 2005, p. 489</ref> The National Socialists provided a plethora of social welfare programs under Nazi's concept of [[Volksgemeinschaft]] which promoted the collectivity of a \"people's community\" where citizens would sacrifice themselves for the greater good. The NSV operated \"8,000 day-nurseries\" by 1939 and funded holiday homes for mothers, distributed additional food for large families and was involved with a \"wide variety of other facilities\".<ref name=Evans/>\n \nThe Nazi social welfare provisions included old age insurance, rent supplements, unemployment and disability benefits, old-age homes, interest-free loans for married couples, along with healthcare insurance, which was not decreed mandatory until 1941.<ref>[[G\u00f6tz Aly]], ''Hitler's Beneficiaries: Plunder, Racial War, and the Nazi Welfare State'', New York: NY, Metropolitan Books, 2007, p. 50.</ref> One of the NSV branches, the Office of Institutional and Special Welfare, was responsible \"for travellers' aid at railway stations; relief for ex-convicts; 'support' for re-migrants from abroad; assistance for the physically disabled, hard-of-hearing, deaf, mute, and blind; relief for the elderly, homeless and alcoholics; and the fight against illicit drugs and epidemics\".<ref> Martina Steber and Bernhard Gotto, ''Visions of Community in Nazi Germany: Social Engineering and Private Lives'', Oxford: UK, Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 93</ref> The Office of Youth Relief, which had 30,000 branches offices by 1941, took the job of supervising \"social workers, corrective training, mediation assistance\" and dealing with judicial authorities to prevent juvenile delinquency.<ref> Martina Steber and Bernhard Gotto, ''Visions of Community in Nazi Germany: Social Engineering and Private Lives'', Oxford: UK, Oxford University Press, 2014, pp. 93-94</ref>\n\n===Socialism and communism===\nFascism is historically strongly opposed to [[socialism]] and [[communism]], due to their support of [[Class conflict|class revolution]] as well as \"decadent\" values, including [[internationalism (politics)|internationalism]], [[egalitarianism]], horizontal [[collectivism]], [[materialism]] and [[cosmopolitanism]].{{sfn|Blamires|2006|p=610}}{{sfn|Blamires|2006|p=404}} Fascists have thus commonly campaigned with [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] agendas.{{sfn|Blamires|2006|p=96}} Fascism opposed the [[Internationalist/Defencist Schism|international]] character of mainstream [[socialism]], but in opposing this international character, it often defined itself as a \"nationalist\" form of socialism, an alternative to the mainstream form of socialism which it regarded as its bitter enemy.{{sfn|Blamires|2006|p=610}} Hitler at times attempted to redefine the word socialism, such as saying: \"Socialism! That is an unfortunate word altogether... What does socialism really mean? If people have something to eat and their pleasures, then they have their socialism\".<ref>Henry A. Turner, ''\"German Big Business and the Rise of Hitler\"'', Oxford University Press, 1985. pg 77</ref> In 1930, Hitler said: \"Our adopted term 'Socialist' has nothing to do with Marxist Socialism.

''Khrushchev Remembers''. p. 433.</ref>\n\nMainstream socialists have typically rejected and opposed fascism in turn.{{sfn|Blamires|2006|p=610}} Many communists regarded fascism as a tool of the ruling-class to destroy the working-class, regarding it as \"the open but indirect dictatorship of capital.\" However, the agency and genuine belief of fascists was recognised by some communist writers, like Antonio Gramsci, Palmiro Togliatti and Otto Bauer, who instead believed fascism to be a genuine mass movement that arose as a consequence of the specific socio-economic conditions of the societies it arose in.<ref>Payne, S.G., 1996. A history of fascism, 1914\u20131945. University of Wisconsin Pres, pp.124-128</ref> Despite the mutual antagonism that would later develop between the two, the attitude of communists towards early fascism was more ambivalent than it might appear from the writings of individual communist theorists. Fascism was, in the early days, sometimes perceived as less of a mortal rival to revolutionary Marxism than as a heresy from it. Mussolini's government was one of the first in Western Europe to diplomatically recognise the USSR, doing so in 1924. On June 20th 1923, Karl Radek gave a speech before the Comintern in which he proposed a common front with the Nazis in Germany. However, the two radicalisms were mutually exclusive and they later become profound enemies.<ref>Payne, S.G., 1996. A history of fascism, 1914\u20131945.
