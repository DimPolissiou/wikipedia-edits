In this sense, the word implies \"suspected meningitis\". The words \"meningeal symptoms\" can be used instead to avoid confusion between the [[word sense]]s, thus reserving the term \"meningism\" for its strict sense.

It therefore requires [[differential diagnosis|differentiating]] from other CNS problems with similar symptoms, including meningitis and some types of [[intracranial hemorrhage]]. Related clinical signs include [[#Kernig's sign|Kernig's sign]] and three signs all named [[Brudzi\u0144ski's sign|Brudzinski's sign]].\n\nAlthough [[nosology|nosologic]] coding systems such as ICD-10 and MeSH define meningism/meningismus as meningitis-like but in fact not meningitis, many physicians use the term \"meningism\" in a loose [[word sense|sense]] clinically to refer to any meningitis-like set of symptoms ''before the cause is definitively known''. In this sense, the word implies \"suspected meningitis\". The words \"meningeal symptoms\" can be used instead to avoid confusion between the [[word sense]]s, thus reserving the term \"meningism\" for its strict sense. Readers of the medical literature should remain aware that the words are used in more than one sense.\n\n== Signs and symptoms ==\n[[File:Kernig's sign cerebrospinal meningitis.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Positive Kernig's sign in cerebrospinal meningitis]]\nThe main clinical signs that indicate meningism are ''nuchal rigidity'', ''Kernig's sign'' and ''Brudzinski's signs''.

She was launched at [[Saint-Malo]] in 1793. The British [[Royal Navy]] captured her in 1795 and took her into service as HMS ''Vesuve''. The Navy sold her in 1802.\n\n==French career==\nThe ''cannoni\u00e8re'' ''V\u00e9suve'' was under the command of ''lieutenant de vaisseau non entretenu'' Desguetz on 22 October 1793.<ref group=Note>In the rank of \"lieutenant de vaisseau non entretenu\", \"non entrentenu\" means \"not paid\", or \"without a salary\". The rank was that of lieutenant, but junior to a \"lieutenant de vaisseau entretenu\". In addition to not being paid, an officer \"non entretenu\" would wear the uniform and have authority only when on service. There was a fixed number of positions for \"entretenus\", which required a competitive examination, while there was no limit on the number of \"non entretenus\", and one could obtain the status by a simple examination or by captaining a merchantman.</ref> She had been stationed in the bay of Cancale, then at Cap Fr\u00e9hel.

(During this period he received promotion to ''lieutenant de vaisseau''.) She escorted convoys between Paimpol and Granville, and conducted liaison missions between Granville and [[Saint-Malo]]. She was successively stationed at H\u00e9bihens, Cancale, and Br\u00e9hat [[Roadstead|Roads]].<ref>''Fonds Marine'', p.110.</ref>\n\nBetween 4 February and her capture ''V\u00e9suve'' was under the command of ''lieutenant de vaisseau non entretenu'' Nicholas Guidelou.

''Melampus'' captured an armed brig and ''Hebe'' captured six merchant vessels: ''Maria Louisa'', [[Lively (1795 ship)|''Abeille'']], ''Bon Foi'', \n''Patrouille'', ''Eleonore'', and ''Pecheur''. The brig of war was armed with four 24-pounders and had a crew of 60 men. Later she was identified as the 4-gun ''V\u00e9suve''.

She was launched at [[Saint-Malo]] in 1793. The British [[Royal Navy]] captured her in 1795 and took her into service as HMS ''Vesuve''. The Navy sold her in 1802.\n\n==French career==\nThe ''cannoni\u00e8re'' ''V\u00e9suve'' was under the command of ''lieutenant de vaisseau non entretenu'' Desguetz on 22 October 1793.<ref group=Note>In the rank of \"lieutenant de vaisseau non entretenu\", \"non entrentenu\" means \"not paid\", or \"without a salary\". The rank was that of lieutenant, but junior to a \"lieutenant de vaisseau entretenu\". In addition to not being paid, an officer \"non entretenu\" would wear the uniform and have authority only when on service. There was a fixed number of positions for \"entretenus\", which required a competitive examination, while there was no limit on the number of \"non entretenus\", and one could obtain the status by a simple examination or by captaining a merchantman.</ref> She had been stationed in the bay of Cancale, then at Cap Fr\u00e9hel.

She was successively stationed at H\u00e9bihens, Cancale, and Br\u00e9hat [[Roadstead|Roads]].<ref>''Fonds Marine'', p.110.</ref>\n\nBetween 4 February and her capture ''V\u00e9suve'' was under the command of ''lieutenant de vaisseau non entretenu'' Nicholas Guidelou.

''Melampus'' captured an armed brig and ''Hebe'' captured six merchant vessels: ''Maria Louisa'', [[Lively (1795 ship)|''Abeille'']], ''Bon Foi'', \n''Patrouille'', ''Eleonore'', and ''Pecheur''. The brig of war was armed with four 24-pounders and had a crew of 60 men. Later she was identified as the 4-gun ''V\u00e9suve''.

Although Kelly has had two number one songs on the pop chart, \"I Believe I Can Fly\" is his most successful single.

Kelly was asked about the creative process behind the song: \"When I met Michael Jordan on a basketball court at an athletic club \u2014 we hooped together in Chicago \u2014 he came to me and asked me if I wanted to do a song for his upcoming movie,\" Kelly said. \"I was like, \u201cYeah!\u201d I didn\u2019t even ask what it was.

{{Quote|\"I wouldn't call them delays. It was highly optimistic that we could start quickly until scripts are written. If there's no scripts, there's nothing, right? The scripts took four years. You can call that a delay, but it's not really a delay because from the time we pushed the button to really go make the movies [until now,] we're clicking along perfectly. We're doing very well because of all the time that we had to develop the system and the pipeline and all that. We weren't wasting time, we were putting it into tech development and design. So when all the scripts were approved, everything was designed. Every character, every creature, every setting. In a funny way it was to the benefit of the film because the design team had more time to work. . . . Most of the actors, the key principals, have all read all four scripts, so they know exactly what their character arcs are, they know where they're going, they know how to modulate their arc now across the first two films\".<ref name=\"Vanity Fair Legacy\"/>}} He was optimistic that the delays would not harm the films' success, comparing it to his films ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' and ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', which were both commercially successful sequels released seven years after the original films.<ref name=\"Vanity Fair Legacy\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/film/james-cameron-avatar-movie-sequel-2081078|title=James Cameron isn't worried about the gap between Avatar movies|date=May 30, 2017|publisher=}}</ref> Several creatures introduced in ''[[Avatar Flight of Passage]]'' will be featured in the film.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://movieweb.com/avatar-sequels-pandora-theme-park-crossover/|title=Avatar Sequels Stay on Pandora, Will Include Theme Park Crossovers |work=[[MovieWeb]] |date=August 14, 2018 |accessdate= August 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2019, it was reported that the release of ''Avatar 2'' had been pushed back to December 2021 as a result of the announcement of three upcoming ''[[Star Wars]]'' films<ref name=\"auto\"/> to be released respectively in December 2023, December 2025 and December 2027.\n\n===Writing===\nIn 2012, Cameron stated that the sequels were being written as \"separate stories that have an overall arc inclusive of the first film\", with the second having a clear conclusion instead of a [[cliffhanger]] to the next film.

It creates thousands of false targets, so we've had to figure out how to get around that problem, which we did. Basically, whenever you add water to any problem, it just gets ten times harder.

You can call that a delay, but it's not really a delay because from the time we pushed the button to really go make the movies [until now,] we're clicking along perfectly. We're doing very well because of all the time that we had to develop the system and the pipeline and all that. We weren't wasting time, we were putting it into tech development and design. So when all the scripts were approved, everything was designed. Every character, every creature, every setting. In a funny way it was to the benefit of the film because the design team had more time to work. . . . Most of the actors, the key principals, have all read all four scripts, so they know exactly what their character arcs are, they know where they're going, they know how to modulate their arc now across the first two films\".<ref name=\"Vanity Fair Legacy\"/>}} He was optimistic that the delays would not harm the films' success, comparing it to his films ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' and ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', which were both commercially successful sequels released seven years after the original films.<ref name=\"Vanity Fair Legacy\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/film/james-cameron-avatar-movie-sequel-2081078|title=James Cameron isn't worried about the gap between Avatar movies|date=May 30, 2017|publisher=}}</ref> Several creatures introduced in ''[[Avatar Flight of Passage]]'' will be featured in the film.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://movieweb.com/avatar-sequels-pandora-theme-park-crossover/|title=Avatar Sequels Stay on Pandora, Will Include Theme Park Crossovers |work=[[MovieWeb]] |date=August 14, 2018 |accessdate= August 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2019, it was reported that the release of ''Avatar 2'' had been pushed back to December 2021 as a result of the announcement of three upcoming ''[[Star Wars]]'' films<ref name=\"auto\"/> to be released respectively in December 2023, December 2025 and December 2027.\n\n===Writing===\nIn 2012, Cameron stated that the sequels were being written as \"separate stories that have an overall arc inclusive of the first film\", with the second having a clear conclusion instead of a [[cliffhanger]] to the next film.

The clinical syndrome is associated with pathological findings including pneumonia, [[eosinophilic pneumonia]], [[cryptogenic organizing pneumonia]], acute fibrinous organizing pneumonia, and [[Diffuse alveolar damage|diffuse alveolar damage (DAD)]]. Of these, the pathology most commonly associated with ARDS is DAD, which is characterized by a diffuse inflammation of lung tissue. The triggering insult to the tissue usually results in an initial release of [[cytokine|chemical signals]] and other inflammatory mediators secreted by local [[epithelium|epithelial]] and [[endothelium|endothelial]] cells.\n\n[[Neutrophils]] and some T-[[lymphocytes]] quickly migrate into the inflamed lung tissue and contribute in the amplification of the phenomenon. Typical histological presentation involves diffuse [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveolar]] damage and [[hyaline]] membrane formation in alveolar walls. Although the triggering mechanisms are not completely understood, recent research has examined the role of inflammation and mechanical stress.\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:Transfusion-related acute lung injury chest X-ray.gif|thumb|upright=2.0|A chest x-ray of [[transfusion-related acute lung injury]] which lead to ARDS]]\nDiagnostic criteria for ARDS have changed over time as understanding of the [[Pathophysiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome|pathophysiology]] has evolved.

This degree of PEEP may be delivered noninvasively with [[Continuous positive airway pressure|CPAP]] to diagnose mild ARDS.\n\nNote that the 2012 \"Berlin criteria\" are a modification of the prior 1994 consensus conference definitions (see ''[[Acute respiratory distress syndrome#History|history]]'').<ref name=\"Rippe-ARDS\" />\n\n=== Medical imaging ===\nRadiologic imaging has long been a criterion for diagnosis of ARDS. Original definitions of ARDS specified that correlative [[chest X-ray]] findings were required for diagnosis, the diagnostic criteria have been expanded over time to accept [[Computed tomography|CT]] and [[ultrasound]] findings as equally contributory. Generally, radiographic findings of fluid accumulation (pulmonary edema) affecting both lungs and unrelated to increased cardiopulmonary vascular pressure (such as in heart failure) may be suggestive of ARDS. \nUltrasound findings suggestive of ARDS include the following:\n* Anterior subpleural consolidations\n* Absence or reduction of lung sliding\n* \"Spared areas\" of normal parenchyma\n* [[Pleura]]l line abnormalities (irregular thickened fragmented pleural line)\n* Nonhomogeneous distribution of B-lines (a characteristic ultrasound finding suggestive of fluid accumulation in the lungs)<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Volpicelli|first=Giovanni|last2=Elbarbary|first2=Mahmoud|last3=Blaivas|first3=Michael|last4=Lichtenstein|first4=Daniel A.|last5=Mathis|first5=Gebhard|last6=Kirkpatrick|first6=Andrew W.|last7=Melniker|first7=Lawrence|last8=Gargani|first8=Luna|last9=Noble|first9=Vicki E.|date=2012-04-01|title=International evidence-based recommendations for point-of-care lung ultrasound|journal=Intensive Care Medicine|volume=38|issue=4|pages=577\u2013591|doi=10.1007/s00134-012-2513-4|issn=1432-1238|pmid=22392031}}</ref>\n\n==Treatment==\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome is usually treated with [[mechanical ventilation]] in the intensive care unit (ICU). Mechanical ventilation is usually delivered through a rigid tube which enters the oral cavity and is secured in the [[trachea|airway]] (endotracheal intubation), or by [[tracheotomy|tracheostomy]] when prolonged ventilation (\u22652 weeks) is necessary. The role of [[non-invasive ventilation]] is limited to the very early period of the disease or to prevent worsening respiratory distress in individuals with [[atypical pneumonia]]s, [[pulmonary contusion|lung bruising]], or major surgery patients, who are at risk of developing ARDS. Treatment of the underlying cause is crucial. Appropriate [[antibiotic]] therapy is started as soon as [[microbiological culture|culture]] results are available, or if infection is suspected (whichever is earlier).

When sepsis is diagnosed, appropriate local [[Guideline (medical)|protocols]] are followed.\n\n===Mechanical ventilation===\n{{further|Dual-control modes of ventilation|l1=Pressure regulated volume control}}\n\nThe overall goal of mechanical ventilation is to maintain acceptable gas exchange to meet the body's metabolic demands and to minimize adverse effects in its application. The parameters PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure, to keep alveoli open), mean airway pressure (to promote recruitment (opening) of easily collapsible alveoli and predictor of hemodynamic effects) and [[plateau pressure]] (best predictor of alveolar overdistention) are used.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Malhotra A |title=Low-tidal-volume ventilation in the acute respiratory distress syndrome |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=357 |issue=11 |pages=1113\u201320 |year=2007 |pmid=17855672 |doi=10.1056/NEJMct074213 |pmc=2287190}}</ref>\n\nPreviously, mechanical ventilation aimed to achieve tidal volumes (''V''<sub>t</sub>) of 12\u201315 ml/kg (where the weight is [[body weight#ideal body weight|ideal body weight]] rather than actual weight). Recent studies have shown that high tidal volumes can overstretch alveoli resulting in [[volutrauma]] (secondary lung injury). The ARDS Clinical Network, or ARDSNet, completed a clinical trial that showed improved mortality when people with ARDS were ventilated with a tidal volume of 6 ml/kg compared to the traditional 12 ml/kg. Low tidal volumes (''V''<sub>t</sub>) may cause a permitted [[permissive hypercapnia|rise in blood carbon dioxide levels]] and [[atelectasis|collapse of alveoli]]<ref name=\"Rippe-ARDS\"/> because of their inherent tendency to increase shunting within the lung. Physiologic dead space cannot change as it is ventilation without perfusion. A shunt is perfusion without ventilation.\n\nLow tidal volume ventilation was the primary independent variable associated with reduced mortality in the NIH-sponsored ARDSnet trial of tidal volume in ARDS. Plateau pressure less than 30&nbsp;cm {{chem|H|2|O}} was a secondary goal, and subsequent analyses of the data from the ARDSnet trial and other experimental data demonstrate that there appears to be no safe upper limit to plateau pressure; regardless of plateau pressure, individuals with ARDS fare better with low tidal volumes.<ref name=\"Hager05\">{{cite journal|last1=Hager|first1=DN|last2=Krishnan|first2=JA|last3=Hayden|first3=DL|last4=Brower|first4=RG|last5=ARDS Clinical Trials Network|title=Tidal volume reduction in patients with acute lung injury when plateau pressures are not high|journal=American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine|date=November 2005|volume=172|issue=10|pages=1241\u20135|pmid=16081547|doi=10.1164/rccm.200501-048cp|pmc=2718413}}</ref>\n\n====Airway pressure release ventilation====\nNo particular ventilator mode is known to improve mortality in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nSome [[respiratory therapist|practitioners]] favor [[airway pressure release ventilation]] when treating ARDS.

In ARDS, three populations of alveoli can be distinguished.  There are normal alveoli which are always inflated and engaging in gas exchange, flooded alveoli which can never, under any ventilatory regime, be used for gas exchange, and atelectatic or partially flooded alveoli that can be \"recruited\" to participate in gas exchange under certain ventilatory regimens.  The recruitable alveoli represent a continuous population, some of which can be recruited with minimal PEEP, and others which can only be recruited with high levels of PEEP.  An additional complication is that some alveoli can only be opened with higher airway pressures than are needed to keep them open, hence the justification for maneuvers where PEEP is increased to very high levels for seconds to minutes before dropping the PEEP to a lower level. PEEP can be harmful; high PEEP necessarily increases mean airway pressure and alveolar pressure, which can damage normal alveoli by overdistension resulting in DAD. A compromise between the beneficial and adverse effects of PEEP is inevitable.\n\nThe 'best PEEP' used to be defined as 'some' cm{{chem|H|2|O}} above the lower inflection point (LIP) in the [[Sigmoid function|sigmoidal]] pressure-volume relationship curve of the lung. Recent research has shown that the LIP-point pressure is no better than any pressure above it, as recruitment of collapsed alveoli{{mdash}}and, more importantly, the overdistension of aerated units{{mdash}}occur throughout the whole inflation. Despite the awkwardness of most procedures used to trace the pressure-volume curve, it is still used by some{{who|date=October 2013}} to define the ''minimum'' PEEP to be applied to their patients. Some new ventilators can automatically plot a pressure-volume curve.\n\nPEEP may also be set empirically. Some authors{{who|date=October 2013}} suggest performing a 'recruiting maneuver'{{mdash}}a short time at a very high continuous positive airway pressure, such as 50&nbsp;cm{{chem|H|2|O}} (4.9 kPa){{mdash}}to recruit or open collapsed units with a high distending pressure before restoring previous ventilation. The final PEEP level should be the one just before the drop in Pa{{chem|O|2}} or [[hemoglobin|peripheral blood oxygen saturation]] during a step-down trial.\n\n[[Intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure|Intrinsic PEEP]] (iPEEP) or auto-PEEP{{mdash}}first described by John Marini of St. Paul Regions Hospital{{mdash}}is a potentially unrecognized contributor to PEEP in intubated individuals.  When ventilating at high frequencies, its contribution can be substantial, particularly in people with obstructive lung disease such as [[asthma]] or [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD). iPEEP has been measured in very few formal studies on ventilation in ARDS, and its contribution is largely unknown. Its measurement is recommended in the treatment of people who have ARDS, especially when using [[high-frequency ventilation|high-frequency (oscillatory/jet) ventilation]].\n\n=== Prone position ===\nThe position of lung infiltrates in acute respiratory distress syndrome is non-uniform.

The clinical syndrome is associated with pathological findings including pneumonia, [[eosinophilic pneumonia]], [[cryptogenic organizing pneumonia]], acute fibrinous organizing pneumonia, and [[Diffuse alveolar damage|diffuse alveolar damage (DAD)]]. Of these, the pathology most commonly associated with ARDS is DAD, which is characterized by a diffuse inflammation of lung tissue. The triggering insult to the tissue usually results in an initial release of [[cytokine|chemical signals]] and other inflammatory mediators secreted by local [[epithelium|epithelial]] and [[endothelium|endothelial]] cells.\n\n[[Neutrophils]] and some T-[[lymphocytes]] quickly migrate into the inflamed lung tissue and contribute in the amplification of the phenomenon. Typical histological presentation involves diffuse [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveolar]] damage and [[hyaline]] membrane formation in alveolar walls. Although the triggering mechanisms are not completely understood, recent research has examined the role of inflammation and mechanical stress.\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:Transfusion-related acute lung injury chest X-ray.gif|thumb|upright=2.0|A chest x-ray of [[transfusion-related acute lung injury]] which lead to ARDS]]\nDiagnostic criteria for ARDS have changed over time as understanding of the [[Pathophysiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome|pathophysiology]] has evolved.

Generally, radiographic findings of fluid accumulation (pulmonary edema) affecting both lungs and unrelated to increased cardiopulmonary vascular pressure (such as in heart failure) may be suggestive of ARDS. \nUltrasound findings suggestive of ARDS include the following:\n* Anterior subpleural consolidations\n* Absence or reduction of lung sliding\n* \"Spared areas\" of normal parenchyma\n* [[Pleura]]l line abnormalities (irregular thickened fragmented pleural line)\n* Nonhomogeneous distribution of B-lines (a characteristic ultrasound finding suggestive of fluid accumulation in the lungs)<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Volpicelli|first=Giovanni|last2=Elbarbary|first2=Mahmoud|last3=Blaivas|first3=Michael|last4=Lichtenstein|first4=Daniel A.|last5=Mathis|first5=Gebhard|last6=Kirkpatrick|first6=Andrew W.|last7=Melniker|first7=Lawrence|last8=Gargani|first8=Luna|last9=Noble|first9=Vicki E.|date=2012-04-01|title=International evidence-based recommendations for point-of-care lung ultrasound|journal=Intensive Care Medicine|volume=38|issue=4|pages=577\u2013591|doi=10.1007/s00134-012-2513-4|issn=1432-1238|pmid=22392031}}</ref>\n\n==Treatment==\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome is usually treated with [[mechanical ventilation]] in the intensive care unit (ICU). Mechanical ventilation is usually delivered through a rigid tube which enters the oral cavity and is secured in the [[trachea|airway]] (endotracheal intubation), or by [[tracheotomy|tracheostomy]] when prolonged ventilation (\u22652 weeks) is necessary. The role of [[non-invasive ventilation]] is limited to the very early period of the disease or to prevent worsening respiratory distress in individuals with [[atypical pneumonia]]s, [[pulmonary contusion|lung bruising]], or major surgery patients, who are at risk of developing ARDS. Treatment of the underlying cause is crucial. Appropriate [[antibiotic]] therapy is started as soon as [[microbiological culture|culture]] results are available, or if infection is suspected (whichever is earlier). Empirical therapy may be appropriate if local microbiological surveillance is efficient. Where possible the origin of the infection is removed. When sepsis is diagnosed, appropriate local [[Guideline (medical)|protocols]] are followed.\n\n===Mechanical ventilation===\n{{further|Dual-control modes of ventilation|l1=Pressure regulated volume control}}\n\nThe overall goal of mechanical ventilation is to maintain acceptable gas exchange to meet the body's metabolic demands and to minimize adverse effects in its application. The parameters PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure, to keep alveoli open), mean airway pressure (to promote recruitment (opening) of easily collapsible alveoli and predictor of hemodynamic effects) and [[plateau pressure]] (best predictor of alveolar overdistention) are used.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Malhotra A |title=Low-tidal-volume ventilation in the acute respiratory distress syndrome |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=357 |issue=11 |pages=1113\u201320 |year=2007 |pmid=17855672 |doi=10.1056/NEJMct074213 |pmc=2287190}}</ref>\n\nPreviously, mechanical ventilation aimed to achieve tidal volumes (''V''<sub>t</sub>) of 12\u201315 ml/kg (where the weight is [[body weight#ideal body weight|ideal body weight]] rather than actual weight). Recent studies have shown that high tidal volumes can overstretch alveoli resulting in [[volutrauma]] (secondary lung injury). The ARDS Clinical Network, or ARDSNet, completed a clinical trial that showed improved mortality when people with ARDS were ventilated with a tidal volume of 6 ml/kg compared to the traditional 12 ml/kg. Low tidal volumes (''V''<sub>t</sub>) may cause a permitted [[permissive hypercapnia|rise in blood carbon dioxide levels]] and [[atelectasis|collapse of alveoli]]<ref name=\"Rippe-ARDS\"/> because of their inherent tendency to increase shunting within the lung. Physiologic dead space cannot change as it is ventilation without perfusion. A shunt is perfusion without ventilation.\n\nLow tidal volume ventilation was the primary independent variable associated with reduced mortality in the NIH-sponsored ARDSnet trial of tidal volume in ARDS.

In ARDS, three populations of alveoli can be distinguished.  There are normal alveoli which are always inflated and engaging in gas exchange, flooded alveoli which can never, under any ventilatory regime, be used for gas exchange, and atelectatic or partially flooded alveoli that can be \"recruited\" to participate in gas exchange under certain ventilatory regimens.  The recruitable alveoli represent a continuous population, some of which can be recruited with minimal PEEP, and others which can only be recruited with high levels of PEEP.  An additional complication is that some alveoli can only be opened with higher airway pressures than are needed to keep them open, hence the justification for maneuvers where PEEP is increased to very high levels for seconds to minutes before dropping the PEEP to a lower level. PEEP can be harmful; high PEEP necessarily increases mean airway pressure and alveolar pressure, which can damage normal alveoli by overdistension resulting in DAD. A compromise between the beneficial and adverse effects of PEEP is inevitable.\n\nThe 'best PEEP' used to be defined as 'some' cm{{chem|H|2|O}} above the lower inflection point (LIP) in the [[Sigmoid function|sigmoidal]] pressure-volume relationship curve of the lung. Recent research has shown that the LIP-point pressure is no better than any pressure above it, as recruitment of collapsed alveoli{{mdash}}and, more importantly, the overdistension of aerated units{{mdash}}occur throughout the whole inflation. Despite the awkwardness of most procedures used to trace the pressure-volume curve, it is still used by some{{who|date=October 2013}} to define the ''minimum'' PEEP to be applied to their patients. Some new ventilators can automatically plot a pressure-volume curve.\n\nPEEP may also be set empirically. Some authors{{who|date=October 2013}} suggest performing a 'recruiting maneuver'{{mdash}}a short time at a very high continuous positive airway pressure, such as 50&nbsp;cm{{chem|H|2|O}} (4.9 kPa){{mdash}}to recruit or open collapsed units with a high distending pressure before restoring previous ventilation. The final PEEP level should be the one just before the drop in Pa{{chem|O|2}} or [[hemoglobin|peripheral blood oxygen saturation]] during a step-down trial.\n\n[[Intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure|Intrinsic PEEP]] (iPEEP) or auto-PEEP{{mdash}}first described by John Marini of St. Paul Regions Hospital{{mdash}}is a potentially unrecognized contributor to PEEP in intubated individuals.  When ventilating at high frequencies, its contribution can be substantial, particularly in people with obstructive lung disease such as [[asthma]] or [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD). iPEEP has been measured in very few formal studies on ventilation in ARDS, and its contribution is largely unknown. Its measurement is recommended in the treatment of people who have ARDS, especially when using [[high-frequency ventilation|high-frequency (oscillatory/jet) ventilation]].\n\n=== Prone position ===\nThe position of lung infiltrates in acute respiratory distress syndrome is non-uniform.
