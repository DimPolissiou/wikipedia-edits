The oldest of five children growing up in Greek culture, Zenos admired, respected, and was drawn to Greek sculpture. Greek art influenced his aesthetic vision; additional inspiration came from sculptors [[Michelangelo]], [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]], [[Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux|Carpeaux]] and [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]]. The poetry of [[T. S. Eliot|Eliot]], [[Robert Frost|Frost]], [[Theodore Roethke|Roethke]] and [[Robert Graves|Graves]], is important to Zenos, as is philosophy.\n\n\nBorn in 1951 in [[San Francisco]], Frudakis was raised in [[Wheeling, West Virginia]], and [[Gary, Indiana]], where he worked in the steel mills. He began drawing at a very young age, and in 1972 came to Philadelphia to study at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]]. He studied sculpture with two [[Prix de Rome]] winners: his elder brother, sculptor Evangelos Frudakis, and painter James Hanes. At the [[University of Pennsylvania]], he earned bachelor's and master's degrees in Fine Art.<ref>Sarah Blackman, \"Sculpting a Life\" (feature article on Frudakis), ''The Pennsylvania Gazette'', Class of '82, November/December 2002, p. 3.</ref>\n\n\n==International Sculptures==\n* ''[[Reaching (sculpture)|Reaching]]''.

The oldest of five children growing up in Greek culture, Zenos admired, respected, and was drawn to Greek sculpture. Greek art influenced his aesthetic vision; additional inspiration came from sculptors [[Michelangelo]], [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]], [[Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux|Carpeaux]] and [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]]. The poetry of [[T. S. Eliot|Eliot]], [[Robert Frost|Frost]], [[Theodore Roethke|Roethke]] and [[Robert Graves|Graves]], is important to Zenos, as is philosophy.\n\n\nBorn in 1951 in [[San Francisco]], Frudakis was raised in [[Wheeling, West Virginia]], and [[Gary, Indiana]], where he worked in the steel mills. He began drawing at a very young age, and in 1972 came to Philadelphia to study at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]]. He studied sculpture with two [[Prix de Rome]] winners: his elder brother, sculptor Evangelos Frudakis, and painter James Hanes. At the [[University of Pennsylvania]], he earned bachelor's and master's degrees in Fine Art.<ref>Sarah Blackman, \"Sculpting a Life\" (feature article on Frudakis), ''The Pennsylvania Gazette'', Class of '82, November/December 2002, p. 3.</ref>\n\n\n==International Sculptures==\n* ''[[Reaching (sculpture)|Reaching]]''.

The hiding militants were persuaded to come out but they sprang out of the hideout firing indiscriminately all over the room and at the search party located at the doorway, injuring a member of the search party.''\n\n''Major Rajiv Kumar Joon, realising the gravity of the situation, immediately ordered his search party to cover and engage the militants. The trapped militants jumped into the basement of the house and brought heavy volume of  fire on the search party from an opening. Major Rajiv Kumar Joon, sensing that his comrades could not engage the well-entrenched militants effectively from their location, crawled up to the loophole on the outer side of the basement at great risk to his personal safety, lobbed two hand grenades into the loophole, and fired into it killing one hard core Pakistan trained militant. The other militant continued firing from the corner of the basement with renewed vigour.\n''\n''At this moment, Major Rajiv Kumar Joon, risking his life for the safety of his comrades, daringly approached the loophole to effectively engage and neutralize the concealed militant. In this closest of the close encounters, the Major and the militant came face to face with each other. The latter having the advantage of darkness, fired at Major Rajiv Kumar Joon injuring him grievously on the throat damaging his chest.\n''\n''Major Rajiv Kumar Joon,  grievously  wounded and profusely bleeding, refused to move back and in a final bid sprayed bullets all over the basement killing the militant. In this valiant act of extreme courage and sacrifice, Major Rajiv Kumar Joon single handedly killed both the armed militants saving the lives of his comrades. The two killed militants were later identified as Bashir Ahmed Padar alias Nur-Ur-Haq, self styled company commander of Hizbul Mujahideen and the assassin Ex cabinet Minister of Jammu and Kashmir and Mushtang Ahmed Khande 'Madassar'.

The hiding militants were persuaded to come out but they sprang out of the hideout firing indiscriminately all over the room and at the search party located at the doorway, injuring a member of the search party.''\n\n''Major Rajiv Kumar Joon, realising the gravity of the situation, immediately ordered his search party to cover and engage the militants. The trapped militants jumped into the basement of the house and brought heavy volume of  fire on the search party from an opening. Major Rajiv Kumar Joon, sensing that his comrades could not engage the well-entrenched militants effectively from their location, crawled up to the loophole on the outer side of the basement at great risk to his personal safety, lobbed two hand grenades into the loophole, and fired into it killing one hard core Pakistan trained militant. The other militant continued firing from the corner of the basement with renewed vigour.\n''\n''At this moment, Major Rajiv Kumar Joon, risking his life for the safety of his comrades, daringly approached the loophole to effectively engage and neutralize the concealed militant. In this closest of the close encounters, the Major and the militant came face to face with each other. The latter having the advantage of darkness, fired at Major Rajiv Kumar Joon injuring him grievously on the throat damaging his chest.\n''\n''Major Rajiv Kumar Joon,  grievously  wounded and profusely bleeding, refused to move back and in a final bid sprayed bullets all over the basement killing the militant. In this valiant act of extreme courage and sacrifice, Major Rajiv Kumar Joon single handedly killed both the armed militants saving the lives of his comrades. The two killed militants were later identified as Bashir Ahmed Padar alias Nur-Ur-Haq, self styled company commander of Hizbul Mujahideen and the assassin Ex cabinet Minister of Jammu and Kashmir and Mushtang Ahmed Khande 'Madassar'. Two AK 56 rifles with 3 magazines AK 56 and 22 rounds of ammunition were also recovered in this operation.\n''\n''Major Rajiv Kumar Joon, thus displayed conspicuous courage and gallantry of the highest order, undoubtedly beyond the call of duty and laid down his life fighting the militants.'' <ref>{{cite web |title=Major Rajiv Kumar Joon AC SC {{!}} Honourpoint |url=https://www.honourpoint.in/profile/major-rajiv-kumar-joon-ac-sc/}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Joon, Rajiv Kumar}}\n[[Category:Recipients of the Ashoka Chakra (military decoration)]]\n[[Category:National Defence Academy alumni]]\n[[Category:1994 deaths]]\n[[Category:Indian Army]]\n[[Category:Indian Army officers]]\n[[Category:Indian Army personnel]]\n[[Category:Indian Military Academy alumni]]\n", "name_user": "Koushik Pain", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Kumar_Joon"}
