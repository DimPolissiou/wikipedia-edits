He was the [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Witney (UK Parliament constituency)|Witney]] from [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]] to [[2016 Witney by-election|2016]] and [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|leader]] of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] from 2005 to 2016. He identifies as a [[One-nation conservatism|one-nation conservative]], and has been associated with both [[economic liberalism|economically liberal]] and [[Social liberalism|socially liberal]] policies.\n\n<!--Early life and early political career-->\nBorn in London to an upper-middle-class family, Cameron was educated at [[Heatherdown School]], [[Eton College]], and [[Brasenose College, Oxford]]. From 1988 to 1993 he worked at the [[Conservative Research Department]], latterly assisting the Conservative Prime Minister [[John Major]], before leaving politics to work for [[Carlton Communications]] in 1994. Becoming an MP in 2001, he served in the [[Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet (United Kingdom)|opposition shadow cabinet]] under Conservative leader [[Michael Howard]], and succeeded Howard in 2005. Cameron sought to rebrand the Conservatives, embracing an increasingly socially liberal position. Following the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]], [[2010 United Kingdom government formation|negotiations]] led to Cameron becoming Prime Minister as the head of a [[Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition|coalition government]] with the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] \u2013 [[List of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom by age|the youngest holder of the office]] since the 1810s.<ref name=\"Telegraph11May2009YoungestPM\"/> His [[Premiership of David Cameron|premiership]] was marked by the ongoing effects of the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|late-2000s financial crisis]]; these involved a large deficit in government finances that his government sought to reduce through [[austerity]] measures.

When the Conservatives secured an unexpected majority in the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]] he remained as Prime Minister, this time leading a Conservative-only government.

Kingdom]] from 2010 to 2016. He was the [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Witney (UK Parliament constituency)|Witney]] from [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]] to [[2016 Witney by-election|2016]] and [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|leader]] of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] from 2005 to 2016. He identifies as a [[One-nation conservatism|one-nation conservative]], and has been associated with both [[economic liberalism|economically liberal]] and [[Social liberalism|socially liberal]] policies.\n\n<!--Early life and early political career-->\nBorn in London to an upper-middle-class family, Cameron was educated at [[Heatherdown School]], [[Eton College]], and [[Brasenose College, Oxford]]. From 1988 to 1993 he worked at the [[Conservative Research Department]], latterly assisting the Conservative Prime Minister [[John Major]], before leaving politics to work for [[Carlton Communications]] in 1994. Becoming an MP in 2001, he served in the [[Official Opposition Shadow Cabinet (United Kingdom)|opposition shadow cabinet]] under Conservative leader [[Michael Howard]], and succeeded Howard in 2005. Cameron sought to rebrand the Conservatives, embracing an increasingly socially liberal position.
