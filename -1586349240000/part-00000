Students come from diverse backgrounds, with over 38 nationalities represented. The school offers the [[GCSE]]/[[IGCSE]] syllabus, [[IB Diploma Programme]], IB Career-related Programme and the [[Business and Technology Education Council|BTEC]] qualification. The school is one of three ESF secondary schools on Hong Kong Island, the others being [[West Island School]] and [[Island School]].\n\nAccording to an inspection report from 2019 by the Council of International Schools (CoIS) and the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC), South Island School 'passionately promotes the development of global citizenship and intercultural learning, and the school climate is such that there is a very strong sense of mutual trust amongst all the school's stakeholders.'<ref>{{cite web |title=South Island School \u2013 A Celebration of Excellence |url=https://www.sis.edu.hk/south-island-school-a-celebration-of-excellence/ |accessdate=1 December 2019 |date=15 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 1977, South Island School was founded as an annex of [[Island School]], a fellow [[English Schools Foundation]] School. The school opened with 165 students and 6 teachers, with three classes in Form 1, and one class in Form 2 and Form 3 respectively. Mike Taylor was the first principal. \n\nThe school moved to its current location at 50 Nam Fung Road in 1983. It consisted of the [[Ching Ling Soong]] Block and an outdoor swimming pool.<ref>{{cite web |title=The History of South Island School |url=https://www.sis.edu.hk/history/ |accessdate=1 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nAs the school grew in size, more facilities were required. The next big change to the school came with the construction of the Stephen Hawking Building (named after physicist [[Stephen Hawking]]), and the swimming pool became an indoor one with the Sports Block being built on top of it, allowing for year-round swimming lessons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sis.edu.hk/Warps/Principal%20Msg/Autumn%2004.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-10-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051113033219/http://www.sis.edu.hk/Warps/Principal%20Msg/Autumn%2004.html |archivedate=13 November 2005 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nBy 2003, the increase in student population warranted the construction of a new school block. Construction began on a new eight-storey building that would accompany the C Block and the S Block. By 2004, the new block was completed and was named the Da Vinci (after Italian polymath, [[Leonardo da Vinci]]) Block.\n\nIn the school year of 2007\u20132008, the school was accredited to teach the IB Diploma programme. The IB Centre was opened, a section of the school designated for [[International Baccalaureate]] students in Years 12 and 13. This was renamed the Diploma Centre in the school year of 2009\u20132010. \n\nIn November 2010, the new John Wray Atrium, named after previous principal, John Wray, opened for all students.\n\nIn the following years, many of the school facilities underwent renovations. The library in the C Block was renovated in the summer holidays of 2012 and re-opened in late September the same year, and was renamed as the \"Learning Resource Center\". In November 2012, the renovation of the library was completed, and was reopened as the Learning Resources Centre (LRC).\n\nIn February 2014, additional floors were added to the Sports Block to create The Space, a multipurpose learning space. There is also an astroturf on top of the Space which was completed in the same year. In November, the school completed a redesigned School Hall with state-of-the-art facilities and a 400-seat auditorium.\n\nIn 2016, South Island School adopted the Middle Years Program and the IB CP (career-related) programme. The IB CP was offered in addition to the IB Diploma programme, which places greater emphasis on developing vocational skills. The programme combines academic courses from the IB Diploma programme with the career-related experiences of the BTEC courses to create a personalised and career-focused pathway for students.<ref>{{cite web |title=South Island School's new IB curriculum offer |url=https://www.sis.edu.hk/south-island-schools-new-ib-curriculum-offer/ |accessdate=1 December 2019 |date=23 September 2016}}</ref> Also in the same year, the School Foyer and the Refectory were renovated.\n\nIn 2017, South Island School celebrated its 40th anniversary. Students and staff walked down to Deep Water Bay Beach for charity and participated in activities commemorating the event, such as a time capsule and an art mural.<ref>{{cite web |title=Student Council: Catering, Interhouse and more on SIS40 |url=https://www.facebook.com/notes/south-island-school-student-council/6617-catering-interhouse-and-more-on-sis-40/1371531516268749/ |website=SIS Student Council Facebook page |accessdate=1 December 2019}}</ref> A giant birthday cake was also made, with enough cake for every teacher and student in the school.

In 2019, the classrooms on the 3rd and 4th floors of the C Block were also renovated.\n\n== Governance ==\n\nSouth Island School is part of the English Schools Foundation of 22 schools<ref name=\"About ESF\">{{cite web |title=About ESF |url=https://www.esf.edu.hk/about-esf/ |website=ESF |accessdate=1 December 2019}}</ref> in Hong Kong that operates within the ESF government ordinance.\n\nThe school is accountable to the Board of Governors (Executive Committee) of [[English Schools Foundation]] and its local governing body: School Council. The council meets around six times per year. It has two sub-committees, namely Finance & Personnel (FP) and Learning and Professional Development (LPD) both chaired by community representatives. Among other matters, the FP sub-committee reviews the school's annual budget and recommends acceptance to the full council. It also reviews personnel matters and considers health & safety issues. The LPD subcommittee's work is more aimed at, inter alia, curriculum development, teaching methods and examination performance.<ref>http://www.sis.edu.hk/about-us/school-council</ref>\n\n== Academics ==\n\n=== Curriculum ===\nBetween Year 7 and Year 9, students take the Middle Years Programme (MYP) offered by the International Baccalaureate. The MYP is usually a 5-year programme, but the programme was shortened to 3 years so that the IGCSE programme could still be offered. During Year 7 and 8, all students follow a common curriculum, which includes English, Maths, Science, Chinese, a modern foreign language (French or Spanish), Individuals and Societies, Global Thinking, design, and the arts. At the end of Year 9, all students participate in the Community Project. Students work in groups to investigate, propose, plan and implement a project that serves a need within the school community or the wider Hong Kong community.<ref>{{cite web |title=Family Bauhinia Newsletter (June 2019) |url=https://www.sis.edu.hk/family-bauhinia-newsletter-june-2019/ |accessdate=1 December 2019 |location=Curriculum Update |date=27 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nDuring Year 10 and 11, students follow the I/GCSE curriculum. All students must take English, Mathematics, Sciences (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), PE (examined or non-examined), a language, a humanities subject, and Global Citizenship. In addition, students can choose to take either another language, or another humanities subject.<ref>{{cite web |title=Y10-11 Curriculum |url=https://www.sis.edu.hk/academic/ |accessdate=1 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn Year 12 and 13, students can either choose to do the IB Diploma or the IB Career-related Programme. For the Diploma Programme, students must choose 3 Higher Level subjects and 3 Standard Level subjects, where subjects in the student's first language, additional Language, the humanities, the sciences, mathematics are required. Students also need to complete the Extended Essay, CAS, and the Theory of Knowledge course. Students in the Career-related Programme can choose to substitute some of their IB DP subjects with more applied BTEC subjects, but must still complete the CP core.\n\n=== Higher Education Destinations ===\n\nIn 2019, 40% of South Island School students matriculate to the [[United Kingdom]], 19% to [[Hong Kong]], 13% to the [[United States]], 9% to [[Canada]], 6% to either [[Australia]] or New Zealand, and the remainder matriculate to countries such as [[Korea]] and [[Japan]]. In Hong Kong, 17 students chose to study at the [[University of Hong Kong]], five to [[HKUST]] and six to the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]], while in the UK, 6 students matriculated to [[Imperial College]] and [[University College London|UCL]]. In addition, the most popular universities in Canada were the [[University of British Columbia]] and the [[University of Toronto]] with five students each. \n\nSouth Island School graduates usually apply to a range of courses. Fields such as Economics, and Business and Management have been consistently popular among South Island School graduates.

These houses were:\n\n* Hillary (blue)\n* Tolstoy (red)\n* Aylward (yellow)\n* Schweitzer (green)\n* Jefferson (purple)\n* Marden (orange)\n* Nobel (light blue)\n\nThese 7 houses later were then reorganised to form six houses and were named after the word 'House' in six different languages. \n\nThese houses, along with their respective colours and the language where their name originates from, are:\n\n* Bahay (Yellow) - [[Filipino language|Filipino]]\n* Casa (Red) - [[Spanish language|Spanish]]\n* Shtepi (Green) - [[Albanian language|Albanian]]\n* Maison (Blue) - [[French language|French]]\n* Ku\u0107a (Purple) - [[Croatian language|Croatian]]\n* Namas (Orange) - [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]\n\nThe house colours were allocated after each head of house pulled slips of paper from a hat with a colour written on them. In each year, a house consists of two tutor groups of about 18 students, headed by a tutor of one tutor group, who oversee the students' well-being and performance in school. There is a small 10-minute period at the beginning of each weekday (except for Tuesdays, where the tutor period lasts for half an hour, and Fridays, where there is also another half an hour period before school ends) where all students meet with their tutors. The houses are then grouped into three separate \"Learning Families\", named [[Bamboo]] (consisting of students in Years 9\u201313 in the Kuca, Maison and Namas houses), [[Banyan]] (consisting of students in Years 9\u201313 in the Bahay, Casa and Shtepi houses), and [[Bauhinia]] (all students in Years 7-8). Each house is headed by a Head of House which liaises with student leaders in that particular house.\n\n== Sports and Activities ==\nExtra-curricular activities at the school include [[debating]], [[Model United Nations|MUN]], [[squash (sport)|squash]], [[netball]], [[basketball]], [[Association football|football]], [[swimming (sport)|swimming]], [[chess]], [[tennis]], singing, [[Rugby football|rugby]], [[field hockey]], [[cricket]] and more. Every student is obliged to take part in inter-house [[sport of athletics|athletics]], and inter-house swimming. As well as inter-house competitions, South Island School competes in various inter-school competitions such as basketball and football.

Students come from diverse backgrounds, with over 38 nationalities represented. The school offers the [[GCSE]]/[[IGCSE]] syllabus, [[IB Diploma Programme]], IB Career-related Programme and the [[Business and Technology Education Council|BTEC]] qualification. The school is one of three ESF secondary schools on Hong Kong Island, the others being [[West Island School]] and [[Island School]].\n\nAccording to an inspection report from 2019 by the Council of International Schools (CoIS) and the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC), South Island School 'passionately promotes the development of global citizenship and intercultural learning, and the school climate is such that there is a very strong sense of mutual trust amongst all the school\u2019s stakeholders.'<ref>{{cite web |title=South Island School \u2013 A Celebration of Excellence |url=https://www.sis.edu.hk/south-island-school-a-celebration-of-excellence/ |accessdate=1 December 2019 |date=15 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 1977, South Island School was founded as an annex of [[Island School]], a fellow [[English Schools Foundation]] School. The school opened with 165 students and 6 teachers, with three classes in Form 1, and one class in Form 2 and Form 3 respectively. Mike Taylor was the first principal. \n\nThe school moved to its current location at 50 Nam Fung Road in 1983. It consisted of the [[Ching Ling Soong]] Block and an outdoor swimming pool.<ref>{{cite web |title=The History of South Island School |url=https://www.sis.edu.hk/history/ |accessdate=1 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nAs the school grew in size, more facilities were required. The next big change to the school came with the construction of the Stephen Hawking Building (named after physicist [[Stephen Hawking]]), and the swimming pool became an indoor one with the Sports Block being built on top of it, allowing for year-round swimming lessons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sis.edu.hk/Warps/Principal%20Msg/Autumn%2004.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-10-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051113033219/http://www.sis.edu.hk/Warps/Principal%20Msg/Autumn%2004.html |archivedate=13 November 2005 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nBy 2003, the increase in student population warranted the construction of a new school block. Construction began on a new eight-storey building that would accompany the C Block and the S Block. By 2004, the new block was completed and was named the Da Vinci (after Italian polymath, [[Leonardo da Vinci]]) Block.\n\nIn the school year of 2007-2008, the school was accredited to teach the IB Diploma programme. The IB Centre was opened, a section of the school designated for [[International Baccalaureate]] students in Years 12 and 13. This was renamed the Diploma Centre in the school year of 2009-2010. \n\nIn November 2010, the new John Wray Atrium, named after previous principal, John Wray, opened for all students.\n\nIn the following years, many of the school facilities underwent renovations. The library in the C Block was renovated in the summer holidays of 2012 and re-opened in late September the same year, and was renamed as the \"Learning Resource Center\". In November of 2012, the renovation of the library was completed, and was reopened as the Learning Resources Centre (LRC).\n\nIn February of 2014, additional floors were added to the Sports Block to create The Space, a multipurpose learning space. There is also an astroturf on top of the Space which was completed in the same year. In November, the school completed a redesigned School Hall with state-of-the-art facilities and a 400-seat auditorium.\n\nIn 2016, South Island School adopted the Middle Years Program and the IB CP (career-related) programme. The IB CP was offered in addition to the IB Diploma programme, which places greater emphasis on developing vocational skills. The programme combines academic courses from the IB Diploma programme with the career-related experiences of the BTEC courses to create a personalised and career-focused pathway for students.<ref>{{cite web |title=South Island School's new IB curriculum offer |url=https://www.sis.edu.hk/south-island-schools-new-ib-curriculum-offer/ |accessdate=1 December 2019 |date=23 September 2016}}</ref> Also in the same year, the School Foyer and the Refectory were renovated.\n\nIn 2017, South Island School celebrated its 40th anniversary. Students and staff walked down to Deep Water Bay Beach for charity and participated in activities commemorating the event, such as a time capsule and an art mural.<ref>{{cite web |title=Student Council: Catering, Interhouse and more on SIS40 |url=https://www.facebook.com/notes/south-island-school-student-council/6617-catering-interhouse-and-more-on-sis-40/1371531516268749/ |website=SIS Student Council Facebook page |accessdate=1 December 2019}}</ref> A giant birthday cake was also made, with enough cake for every teacher and student in the school.

In 2019, the classrooms on the 3rd and 4th floors of the C Block were also renovated.\n\n== Governance ==\n\nSouth Island School is part of the English Schools Foundation of 22 schools<ref name=\"About ESF\">{{cite web |title=About ESF |url=https://www.esf.edu.hk/about-esf/ |website=ESF |accessdate=1 December 2019}}</ref> in Hong Kong that operates within the ESF government ordinance.\n\nThe school is accountable to the Board of Governors (Executive Committee) of [[English Schools Foundation]] and its local governing body: School Council. The council meets around six times per year. It has two sub-committees, namely Finance & Personnel (FP) and Learning and Professional Development (LPD) both chaired by community representatives. Among other matters, the FP sub-committee reviews the school's annual budget and recommends acceptance to the full council. It also reviews personnel matters and considers health & safety issues. The LPD subcommittee's work is more aimed at, inter alia, curriculum development, teaching methods and examination performance.<ref>http://www.sis.edu.hk/about-us/school-council</ref>\n\n== Academics ==\n\n=== Curriculum ===\nBetween Year 7 and Year 9, students take the Middle Years Programme (MYP) offered by the International Baccalaureate. The MYP is usually a 5-year programme, but the programme was shortened to 3 years so that the IGCSE programme could still be offered. During Year 7 and 8, all students follow a common curriculum, which includes English, Maths, Science, Chinese, a modern foreign language (French or Spanish), Individuals and Societies, Global Thinking, design, and the arts. At the end of Year 9, all students participate in the Community Project. Students work in groups to investigate, propose, plan and implement a project that serves a need within the school community or the wider Hong Kong community.<ref>{{cite web |title=Family Bauhinia Newsletter (June 2019) |url=https://www.sis.edu.hk/family-bauhinia-newsletter-june-2019/ |accessdate=1 December 2019 |location=Curriculum Update |date=27 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nDuring Year 10 and 11, students follow the I/GCSE curriculum. All students must take English, Mathematics, Sciences (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), PE (examined or non-examined), a language, a humanities subject, and Global Citizenship. In addition, students can choose to take either another language, or another humanities subject.<ref>{{cite web |title=Y10-11 Curriculum |url=https://www.sis.edu.hk/academic/ |accessdate=1 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn Year 12 and 13, students can either choose to do the IB Diploma or the IB Career-related Programme. For the Diploma Programme, students must choose 3 Higher Level subjects and 3 Standard Level subjects, where subjects in the student's first language, additional Language, the humanities, the sciences, mathematics are required. Students also need to complete the Extended Essay, CAS, and the Theory of Knowledge course. Students in the Career-related Programme can choose to substitute some of their IB DP subjects with more applied BTEC subjects, but must still complete the CP core.\n\n=== Higher Education Destinations ===\n\nIn 2019, 40% of South Island School students matriculate to the [[United Kingdom]], 19% to [[Hong Kong]], 13% to the [[United States]], 9% to [[Canada]], 6% to either [[Australia]] or New Zealand, and the remainder matriculate to countries such as [[Korea]] and [[Japan]]. In Hong Kong, 17 students chose to study at the [[University of Hong Kong]], five to [[HKUST]] and six to the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]], while in the UK, 6 students matriculated to [[Imperial College]] and [[University College London|UCL]]. In addition, the most popular universities in Canada were the [[University of British Columbia]] and the [[University of Toronto]] with five students each. \n\nSouth Island School graduates usually apply to a range of courses.

The university is a member of the [[Association of Commonwealth Universities]]. It is located about 12 minutes drive from the center of the city of Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State in Western [[Nigeria]].\n\nEkiti State University, Ado-Ekiti, as it is known today, is the only university in Nigeria that has within a quarter of a century had its name changed four times. The name was changed to [[Ondo State University]] in 1985, University of Ado-Ekiti in November 1999, and to its present name Ekiti State University of Ado Ekiti in September 2011.\n\n==Brief history==\n\n===Creation===\n\nOn 14 January 1981, Chief Adekunle Ajasin led by the civilian government of the Ondo State, announced its intent to establish a multi-campus university in the state and a 16-member planning committee was set up. The outcome of the exercise led to the founding of the university in March 1982, when the state government created a university named Obafemi Awolowo University, Ado-Ekiti and appointed Prof. I.O. Oladapo as the first vice-chancellor of the with the composition of the first council headed by Chief B.A. Ajayi on 28 March 1982.\n\nThe university started off in a modest way from an old catering rest house in [[Akure]] and moved to a temporary site in Ado-Ekiti where lectures started soon after with 136 students spread in the Faculties of Arts, Science and Social Sciences. During the 1983/84 session, new courses were established to strengthen the existing faculties; these included geology, biology, chemistry, French, Yoruba studies, philosophy, religious studies, political science and psychology. A fourth faculty, the Faculty of Education, was established in 1983/84 session increasing the student population to 724. In the 1985/86 session, the Faculty of Engineering (Civil, Mechanical and Electrical) and a Department of Banking and Finance were established. The Faculty of Law was established during the 1991/92 session and the Faculty of Agricultural Sciences was established in 2001, bringing the Faculties to 8 in total and a student population of 10,000. The student population is now in excess of 25,000 spread across the various academic programmes.\n\nToday the university is running degree programmes in 66 fields of academic specialisation across the existing faculties and academic programmes, from the School of Postgraduate Studies, Directorate of Continuing Education, Directorate of Part Time Programme, Directorate of Sandwich Education Degree Programme, Affiliate Colleges, Institute of Education, Institute of Science Laboratory Technology, Directorate of Pre-Degree Programmes, General Studies Unit, Centre for Entrepreneurial Studies and the Centre for Research and Development, among others. The faculties have increased from 8 in 2001 to 10 in 2010 with the creation of the College of Medicine which houses the Faculty of Basic Medical Sciences and Faculty of Clinical Sciences while making use of the Ekiti State Teaching Hospital Complex, Ado-Ekiti.\n\n===Change of name===\n\nIn 1984, the ownership of the University came under the military administration of Ondo State since the governance of the country came under the military junta. In 1985, the government as proprietor of the university cancelled the multi-campus and non-residential policy of the university and changed the name to Ondo State University, Ado-Ekiti. (The change of the University's name did not affect the site/location of the campus at Ado-Ekiti, Nigeria. Reference can be made in records of the National Universities Commission (Nigeria), Association of Commonwealth Universities and other public records.)\n\n===Impact of political change on the university ownership and name ===\n\nIn 1996, the Federal Military Government of Nigeria created 6 additional new states to the existing 30 states of the Nigerian Federation. Ekiti State of Nigeria was one of the 6 new states and it was carved out of the Ondo State which was created earlier in 1976 out of defunct Western State of Nigeria. Due to the state creation, economic assets, institutions and establishments previously owned by the Ondo State were shared with the new Ekiti State. Hence, the ownership and proprietorship of the Ondo State University, Ado-Ekiti came under the joint administration of the Governments of Ekiti State and the Ondo State.\n\nIn 1998, due to a collapse of agreements on asset sharing and running of the Ondo State University, Ado-Ekiti between the governments of Ondo and Ekiti States, the government of Ondo State created a new university named Ondo State University at Akungba Akoko, in Ondo State (The Ondo State University, Akungba Akoko was later renamed Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba Akoko while the Ondo State Government also created Ondo State University of Science and Technology at Okitipupa in 2003).\n\nIn view of the policy decisions taken by the Ondo government, the government of Ekiti State took over the ownership, administrative control and funding of the Ondo State University at Ado-Ekiti and enacted a law to rename it the University of Ado-Ekiti. The Ekiti government also took steps to ensure that all records and properties of the university remained intact. By law, the Ekiti State Government transferred all assets, liabilities and records of the Ondo State University, Ado-Ekiti to University of Ado-Ekiti, and the National Universities Commission was informed of the change.\n\n===Political Developments in Ekiti State (2007\u20132011) and its impact===\n\nIn the year 2007, a new civilian Government was installed in Ekiti State. The Government established two new state owned Universities, in addition to the existing University of Ado-Ekiti. The names of the two Universities were The University of Education, Ikere-Ekiti and The University of Science and Technology, Ifaki-Ekiti. These two Universities, along with the existing University of Ado-Ekiti, Nigeria, were funded from the public treasury; this took a great toll on the public purse and led to the polarisation of the educational system.\n\nIn 2010, there was a change of government in Ekiti and the new government convened a statewide education summit in 2011 to consider the best ways to sustain tertiary education and to fund public institutions owned by the government of Ekiti State. Part of the decisions taken at the summit were to merge the three state-owned universities as a single public institution. The Ekiti government by law merged the University of Ado-Ekiti, the University of Education, and the University of Science and Technology, into a new university named Ekiti University. Subsequently, the National Universities Commission in Abuja licensed the University consolidating all the assets and records of the three universities as one institution.\n\nIn the last 30 years, philanthropists have made contributions to the physical development of the university such as Dr. Lawrence Omolayo who donated the administrative block consisting of 271 offices, Aare Afe Babalola ([[Senior Advocate of Nigeria]]), constructed and furnished a 350-seat law auditorium, Dr. Ahmed Aliyu Mustapha built a 400-seat lecture theatre while Ado-Ekiti community built the administrative block for the Faculty of Law. The Kole Ajayi led Alumni Association built an alumni centre for the university in 2002 while the Jadesola Babatola led alumni association constructed the Faculty of Law Moot and Trial Court in 2009. The Education Trust Fund constructed a 1,200\u2013seat and a 750\u2013seat lecture theatre, a new library complex, the Faculty of Agricultural Sciences office complex, new Faculties of Social Sciences, Arts and Education offices. Shell Petroleum recently established an information communication technology centre in the university apart from the donations of NUC{{clarify|What is this?|date=March 2020}} virtual library and Access Education which also donated computers and server to the University.\n\nA large number of the programmes of the university now enjoy accreditation while some enjoy interim accreditation. Almost all the university's academic activities are linked to one on-line facility or the other. The university is undergoing an institutional accreditation exercise as a selected institution in southwest Nigeria. The council of the University also recently set-up an [[financial endowment|endowment fund]] for indigent but brilliant students with an initial contribution of N1million pointing out that the problem of [[Indigence|indigency]] has become real in the university because of the poor economic situation and the rising cost of University education.\n\nThe university has a limited number of residential and sports facilities for staff and students within and outside the main Campus.\n\n==Administration==\nThe following are some of the principal members of the University administration:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+People\n!Position\n!

The university is a member of the [[Association of Commonwealth Universities]]. It is located about 12 minutes drive from the center of the city of Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State in Western [[Nigeria]].\n\nEkiti State University, Ado-Ekiti, as it is known today, is the only university in Nigeria that has within a quarter of a century had its name changed four times. The name was changed to [[Ondo State University]] in 1985, University of Ado-Ekiti in November 1999, and to its present name Ekiti State University of Ado Ekiti in September 2011.\n\n==Brief history==\n\n===Creation===\n\nOn 14 January 1981, Chief Adekunle Ajasin led by the civilian government of the Ondo State, announced its intent to establish a multi-campus university in the state and a 16-member planning committee was set up. The outcome of the exercise led to the founding of the university in March 1982, when the state government created a university named Obafemi Awolowo University, Ado-Ekiti and appointed Prof. I.O. Oladapo as the first vice-chancellor of the with the composition of the first council headed by Chief B.A. Ajayi on 28 March 1982.\n\nThe university started off in a modest way from an old catering rest house in [[Akure]] and moved to a temporary site in Ado-Ekiti where lectures started soon after with 136 students spread in the Faculties of Arts, Science and Social Sciences. During the 1983/84 session, new courses were established to strengthen the existing faculties; these included geology, biology, chemistry, French, Yoruba studies, philosophy, religious studies, political science and psychology. A fourth faculty, the Faculty of Education, was established in 1983/84 session increasing the student population to 724. In the 1985/86 session, the Faculty of Engineering (Civil, Mechanical and Electrical) and a Department of Banking and Finance were established. The Faculty of Law was established during the 1991/92 session and the Faculty of Agricultural Sciences was established in 2001, bringing the Faculties to 8 in total and a student population of 10,000. The student population is now in excess of 25,000 spread across the various academic programmes.\n\nToday the university is running degree programmes in 66 fields of academic specialisation across the existing faculties and academic programmes, from the School of Postgraduate Studies, Directorate of Continuing Education, Directorate of Part Time Programme, Directorate of Sandwich Education Degree Programme, Affiliate Colleges, Institute of Education, Institute of Science Laboratory Technology, Directorate of Pre-Degree Programmes, General Studies Unit, Centre for Entrepreneurial Studies and the Centre for Research and Development, among others. The faculties have increased from 8 in 2001 to 10 in 2010 with the creation of the College of Medicine which houses the Faculty of Basic Medical Sciences and Faculty of Clinical Sciences while making use of the Ekiti State Teaching Hospital Complex, Ado-Ekiti.\n\n===Change of name===\n\nIn 1984, the ownership of the University came under the military administration of Ondo State since the governance of the country came under the military junta. In 1985, the government as proprietor of the university cancelled the multi-campus and non-residential policy of the university and changed the name to Ondo State University, Ado-Ekiti. (The change of the University\u2019s name did not affect the site/location of the campus at Ado-Ekiti, Nigeria. Reference can be made in records of the National Universities Commission (Nigeria), Association of Commonwealth Universities and other public records.)\n\n===Impact of political change on the university ownership and name ===\n\nIn 1996, the Federal Military Government of Nigeria created 6 additional new states to the existing 30 states of the Nigerian Federation.

He was [[Governor of Massachusetts]] for one term (from 1854 to 1855), and served for many years on the faculty of [[Harvard Law School]].  His history of the early years of the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]] is still considered a foundational work on the subject.\n\nBorn in [[Leicester, Massachusetts]], Washburn attended [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]] and [[Williams College|Williams]] before studying law.  After establishing what grew to become a successful and distinguished law practice in [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], Washburn entered politics as a [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]].  After serving several years in the [[Massachusetts Great and General Court|state legislature]], he was elected governor in 1853.  Despite his support for a reform-minded agenda, he was swept out of office on the [[Know Nothing]] tide in 1854.\n\nWashburn joined the faculty of Harvard Law in 1856, where he was a popular and influential figure until his retirement in 1876.  His publications, in addition to his history of the SJC, include a history of his hometown of Leicester and numerous treatises on legal subjects.\n\n==Early life==\nEmory Washburn was born on February 14, 1800 in [[Leicester, Massachusetts]] to Joseph and Ruth (Davis) Washburn, both of whom came from families with deep roots in New England.<ref name=HLS_Hist_202>Warren, p. 202</ref><ref>Ammidown, p. 219</ref>  He was the sixth of seven children.  His father died when he was seven years old, and the local pastor, Zephaniah Swift Moore, became a major influence in his early years.

Although he did not graduate from Harvard, he was [[Admission to the bar in the United States|admitted to the bar]] and opened a practice in [[Charlemont, Massachusetts]].  After six months there he returned to his hometown of Leicester, where he practiced until 1828.

He was [[Governor of Massachusetts]] for one term (from 1854 to 1855), and served for many years on the faculty of [[Harvard Law School]].  His history of the early years of the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]] is still considered a foundational work on the subject.\n\nBorn in [[Leicester, Massachusetts]], Washburn attended [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]] and [[Williams College|Williams]] before studying law.  After establishing what grew to become a successful and distinguished law practice in [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], Washburn entered politics as a [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]].  After serving several years in the [[Massachusetts Great and General Court|state legislature]], he was elected governor in 1853.  Despite his support for a reform-minded agenda, he was swept out of office on the [[Know Nothing]] tide in 1854.\n\nWashburn joined the faculty of Harvard Law in 1856, where he was a popular and influential figure until his retirement in 1876.  His publications, in addition to his history of the SJC, include a history of his hometown of Leicester and numerous treatises on legal subjects.\n\n==Early life==\nEmory Washburn was born on February 14, 1800 in [[Leicester, Massachusetts]] to Joseph and Ruth (Davis) Washburn, both of whom came from families with deep roots in New England.<ref name=HLS_Hist_202>Warren, p. 202</ref><ref>Ammidown, p. 219</ref>  He was the sixth of seven children.  His father died when he was seven years old, and the local pastor, Zephaniah Swift Moore, became a major influence in his early years.  He first attended [[Leicester Academy]], and then entered [[Dartmouth College]], where Moore taught languages, at the age of thirteen.<ref name=HLS_Hist_202/><ref name=Spector119>Spector, p. 119</ref>  He accompanied Moore when the latter moved to [[Williams College]] in 1815, graduating two years later in a class of seven; he was influential in establishing an [[alumni association]] at Williams, serving as its first president.<ref name=Spector119/>\n\n{{quote box|align=right|width=30%\n|quote=Our judgements [are] like our watches: none go just alike but each believes his own.\n|source=&mdash; Washburn notation made while a law student<ref name=Spector119/>\n}}\nWashburn then embarked on the study of law, first with Charles Dewey, a [[Williamstown, Massachusetts|Williamstown]] judge and lawyer, and then at [[Harvard Law School]] under [[Asahel Stearns]].  Although he did not graduate from Harvard, he was [[Admission to the bar in the United States|admitted to the bar]] and opened a practice in [[Charlemont, Massachusetts]].  After six months there he returned to his hometown of Leicester, where he practiced until 1828.

The family consists of husband '''Gordon''', a high school science teacher, and his wife '''Susan''', a nurse. Later, the family expands to include their adopted son '''Miles''', as well as Gordon's sister '''Olivia''', and his father '''Mr. Robinson'''. As [[African Americans]], the family was created as leads for the show, originally targeted to [[Social privilege|underprivileged]] [[inner city]] [[child]]ren.

New York: CTW, 1967.

The rest of the program consists of segments relating to the episodes concepts, generally taking place elsewhere than the Street itself.</ref> ''Sesame Street'' was centered on Gordon and Susan. As per suggested by Harvard psychologist [[Jerome Kagan]], Cooney advised in ''The Potential Uses'' that a series should feature a male lead, to \"provide continuity from one segment to another, establish the tone, and function, subtly, as the master teacher.\" A male teacher would both encourage kids to emulate an intelligent adult, and \"defeminize the early learning atmosphere.\"<ref name=\"usesoftelevision\"/> The decision to create such a character was backed up by research in the US government study ''[[The Negro Family: The Case for National Action]]''. Known better as the Moynihan report, [[US Assistant Secretary of Labor|Assistant Secretary of Labor]] [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]] suggested \"the Negro community has been forced into a matriarchal structure which, because it is so out of line with the rest of the American society, seriously retards the progress of the group as a whole.\"<ref name=\"negrofamily\">Moynihan, Daniel Patrick.

Historian Robert W. Morrow defends Susan's creators, stating that their goal was presenting Gordon as a strong black male capable of supporting his family. ''Sesame Street's'' producers responded to this criticism by making Susan a nurse during the show's second season, and by introducing Gordon's sister Olivia in 1976.<ref>\n\n{{Cite book | last = Morrow | first = Robert W. | title = Sesame Street and the Reform of Children's Television | publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press | year = 2006 | location = Baltimore, Maryland | pages = [https://archive.org/details/sesamestreetrefo0000morr/page/157 157\u2013158] | isbn = 0-8018-8230-3 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/sesamestreetrefo0000morr/page/157 }}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Olivia Robinson\n| series             = [[Sesame Street]]\n| first              = 1976\n| portrayer          = [[Alaina Reed Hall]]\n| gender             = female\n}}\nActors were selected for the roles of Gordon, Susan, Bob, and Mr. Hooper by an audience of children who had watched videotaped performances.<ref name=\"unpaved\">[[David Borgenicht|Borgenicht, David]]. ''[[Sesame Street Unpaved|Sesame Street Unpaved: Scripts, Stories, Secrets, and Songs]]''. New York: Hyperion, 1998.</ref> While some shows replace actors appearing in pilot episodes due to audience involvement, [[casting]] control this early on was and is unusual. In a series of test pilots, Garrett Saunders played Gordon; records of his appearance were lost by producers, and his identity unknown until his family identified him in 2011.<ref name=\"PilotGordon\"/>\n\n[[Matt Robinson (actor)|Matt Robinson]] had joined [[Sesame Workshop|Children's Television Workshop]] (CTW) to assist in the development of ''Sesame Street'', producing and overseeing filmed segments focusing on the diversity of different characters on the show. Robinson was eventually chosen to play the fictional character of Gordon in the series, after the performance of the character by Saunders in test episodes did not work out as the producers hoped.<ref name=PilotGordon>[http://sesamestreet.tumblr.com/post/13975009441/we-found-gordon Sesame Street on Tumblr: \"We Found Gordon!\", December 9, 2011.]</ref> Gordon was the first character with spoken lines in the show, as a result of difficulty in finding someone to fill the figure. This was against his original intentions with joining the show as he preferred a behind-the-scenes role, and was initially reluctant to take the part. Dolores Robinson commented on his backseat role on the set with, \u201cHe was by nature shy, and he knew that they were having a difficult time casting Gordon. And the people overseeing the taping up in the booth, peering at the monitors, kept saying, \u2018Matt knows what to do.

Long's prior experience included hosting ''[[Soul!]]'', a variety series on [[National Educational Television|NET]] (later [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]). Initially, Long was a supply teacher for schools in the [[Bronx]] area, which reportedly surprised and confused many young students.<ref name=\"unpaved\"/> Long earned her doctorate in Urban Education in 1973 from the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], during the show's fourth season. Because Long had grown up on a farm in Michigan, the show's writers established that Susan had as well.\n\n===1969\u20131971===\n''Sesame Street''\u2019s first episode centers on Gordon taking a girl named Sally around Sesame Street, to get acquainted with everyone and everything in her new neighborhood.\n\n====Susan gets a job====\nFrom its inception, ''Sesame Street'' has been highly scrutinized by critics of all kinds. While the program was specially conceived to represent racial harmony, as suggested by followers of Dr. King, the \"second-wave\" [[feminist movement]] had not yet risen to prominence. [[Cynthia Eaton]] and [[Susan Chase]] of the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW) studied the series, in particular male and female interaction. NOW insisted that the program marginalized women and their role in society.\n\n\"After they presented their observations and concerns about our institutionalizing stereotypes, [[Jon Stone]] said 'Well, let's give Susan a career.'\"<ref name=\"unpaved\"/> Stone was the primary [[television director|director]] for the show. Susan became a public health nurse, who would run immunization clinics on ''Sesame Street''. Gordon also was regularly shown helping Susan with household chores. Long recalled to Cooney in 1976 that, \"I was too nice at the beginning, the great dispenser of milk and cookies.\"<ref name=\"1000hours\">Cooney, Joan Ganz. ''Sesame Street. 1,000 Hours of a Perpetual Television Experiment.'' New York: CTW, 1976.

Worthington, OH: Jones Publishing, 1972. 50\u201353.</ref>\n\nEven with the addition of [[Sonia Manzano]] as the young, single woman [[Maria Figueroa Rodriguez|Maria]] in the third season, critics still chided \"All in all, Sesame Street has changed, from being incredibly sexist to being slightly less sexist\"<ref name=\"sexjane\"/> This view was helped by characters like Betty Lou, \"a simpering, querulous little girl with pigtails and a squeaky voice\".<ref name=\"sexjane\"/>\n\n====Hip Muppet deemed stereotype====\nMatt Robinson was, however, the voice of [[Roosevelt Franklin]], a purple Muppet meant to represent an African American boy. While the skits with the character musically provided reading and writing concepts, critics found his [[African-American Vernacular English|jive]]-talking to be a [[cultural stereotype]], and the producers of the series removed him.<ref name=\"unpaved\"/> Roscoe Orman provided the voice of one of Roosevelt's classmates, Hardhat Henry Harris, before joining the series as the third actor to play Gordon. The Roosevelt Franklin Muppet occasionally turned up in multi-Muppet musical routines such as \"Clap, Clap, Clap\" and the Canadian edition of ''Sesame Street'' continued to air the Franklin segments well into the early 1980s.\n\n===1972\u20131974===\n[[Image:Sesame Street Hal Miller as Gordon with Susan and Oscar.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Miller as Gordon, with Long as Susan and Caroll Spinney as Oscar the Grouch. Undated publicity photo, likely from 1972.]]\nHal Miller became Gordon for a brief stretch, 1972 to 1974. Unlike Matt Robinson, Miller didn't sport a [[moustache]], and was slightly heavier-set.<ref name=\"unpaved\"/>\n\n===1974\u20132016===\n[[Roscoe Orman]] became the third Gordon in 1974, a role he kept until 2016. \"The kids who were on the show that first season would not accept me as Gordon,\" Orman remarked. \"One day there's Hal [Miller] as Gordon and the next day there's this new guy who says he's Gordon... the kids, both on the show and at home... they just assume that we are that person we're playing.\" <ref>Lance, Steven. ''Written Out of Television: A TV Lover's Guide to Cast Changes, 1945-1994''. Maryland: Madison Books, 1996.</ref>\n\n====Adopting Miles====\nIn 1985, Roscoe Orman and his wife were about to have their second child together; [[Big Bird]] puppeteer [[Caroll Spinney]] mentioned this to his wife Debra. The two went to producer [[Dulcy Singer]], suggesting that Gordon and Susan should have a child on the show. It was decided that the on-screen couple would [[adopt]], instead of Susan being [[pregnant]], and that new-born [[Miles Orman]] take the role. It was revealed that Susan had been trying to become pregnant, but to no avail due to [[infertility]]. At age seven, Miles Orman quit the series, and was replaced by child actor Imani Patterson.\n\nBefore the series of episodes where Miles is adopted, Gordon and Susan lacked last names. \"Robinson\", named after original Gordon actor Matt Robinson, was shown as Miles' last name on his adoption certificate.<ref name=\"unpaved\"/> Alternatively, Orman has suggested that the name was revealed in a different storyline aired in 1991, involving Gordon teaching in the classroom. Writers felt that the students couldn't address their teacher as \"Gordon\", so Orman suggested \"Mr. Robinson\".\n\nSimilarly, Mr. Hooper's first name was only revealed on his [[GED]]<!-- in season ##-->,<ref name=\"unpaved\"/> Bob Johnson's last name went unrevealed for years, and Gina Jefferson's last name first appeared on the door of her new [[veterinary practice]], in 2002.\n\n====Trash Gordon====\n{{Main|Trash Gordon}}\nRoscoe Orman has garnered more screen time since season 35, playing Trash Gordon, the hero of a series of bedtime stories [[Oscar the Grouch]] reads to [[Slimey the Worm]] at the end of each episode. Based on [[Flash Gordon]], Trash is an intergalactic traveller, who encounters odd creatures on each planet he visits. Trash Gordon escapes peril in each chapter, thanks to his quick thinking; when a living pile of rotten bananas confronts Trash, for example, it is soon chased away by an \"Intergalactical Monkey\" he happened to have with him.<ref name=\"Trashmonkey\">''Sesame Street'' episode 4061, first broadcast in 2005, on PBS.</ref>\n\n====Recent appearances====\n[[Image:Roscoe orman 2007.jpg|thumb|left|Roscoe Orman has played Gordon from 1974 to 2016. He is seen here at the 2007 [[Texas Book Festival]] in [[Austin, Texas]].]]\nLooking back on his role, over the last 33 years, Orman commented \"If I could boast of no other major career accomplishment, having played a central role as I have in the development and continuation of this landmark series would alone have made my life sufficiently meaningful. The historical significance of Sesame Street and its surprising longevity have made my association with the show, in many regards, my life's crowning achievement.\"<ref name=\"sesamedad\"/> However, Orman doesn't credit ''Sesame Street'' as having defined himself personally and his overall career; The [[Free Southern Theater]] of New Orleans and [[The New Lafayette Theatre]] of Harlem collectively take that honor.\n\nBy 2002, Imani Patterson left his role as Miles, and was replaced by actor [[Olamide Faison]]. As a recording artist of the mildly successful hip-hop group [[Imajin (R&B group)|Imajin]],<ref>[http://www.sesameworkshop.org/aboutus/pressroom/presskits/season37/cast_bios.php#bios_5 Sesame Street - Season 37 Press Kit - Cast Bios<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Faison could be used more frequently as a singer on the series. Plot lines like season 36 episode 4089 focused on Miles singing numerous 1960s-style parody songs for ''[[American Bandstand|American Fruitstand]]''.\n\nIn episode 4112 (2006), Miles graduated [[high school]] alongside Gabi, despite the fact that the characters' respective births on the show occurred four years apart. A flashback in this episode also revealed that Miles was shy on his first day of school.\n\n[[Loretta Long]] and [[Bob McGrath]] are the only two remaining non-puppeteer actors on ''Sesame Street'' from its first episode, as Orman's contract for the show expired, and [[Will Lee]] (Mr. Hooper) died in 1982. While neither actor has appeared in a significant number of episodes since about season 38, the longevity of their roles are with few precedents. Of the Muppets from the first episode&mdash;[[Big Bird]], [[Oscar the Grouch]], [[Kermit the Frog]], [[Cookie Monster]], and [[Bert and Ernie]]&mdash;all except Kermit are still major characters on the show. However, [[Jim Henson]] (Kermit, Ernie) died, with [[Steve Whitmire]] playing Ernie (Kermit no longer appears); [[Frank Oz]], busy as a director, now only puppets Grover, Bert, and Cookie Monster a couple of times each season ([[David Rudman]] and [[Eric Jacobson]] have largely taken over his characters); and [[Caroll Spinney]] retired in 2018, handing over the role of Big Bird to [[Matt Vogel (puppeteer)|Matt Vogel]], and Oscar the Grouch to Jacobson.\n\nOn July 28, 2016, it was announced that Gordon would be dropped from the show as Orman's contract was not renewed as part of Sesame Workshop's re-tooling for the series.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Kevin L.|title=\u2018Sesame Street\u2019 Lets Go Longtime Cast Members Bob, Gordon and Luis |url=http://ww2.kqed.org/arts/2016/07/27/sesame-street-lets-go-longtime-cast-members-bob-gordon-and-luis/|website=KQED Public Media for Northern California |accessdate=28 July 2016}}</ref> Following his departure, the workshop stated that Orman would continue to represent them at public events.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lujan|first1=Adam|title=Sesame Street let go three longtime cast members|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/07/28/sesame-street-cast-changes-hbo |website=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=28 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Birthdays===\nSince ''Sesame Street Magazine'' published calendars in every issue, character birthdays were established. Gordon's birthday is February 24, Susan's is May 4, and Miles's is December 4.\n\n==Relatives==\n[[Image:Sesame Street episode 2312 Kevin Clash.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Kevin Clash as Adult Miles on episode 2313.]]\n[[Image:Sesame Street episode 2125 Susan Robinson's parents.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Susan's parents' first appearance on the series.]]\nWriters introduced the character of Olivia (Gordon's sister), played by actress [[Alaina Reed Hall]], in 1976 to show a relationship between adult siblings. Olivia was a photographer and last appeared on the show in 1988 (so Reed could work on the TV sitcom ''[[227 (TV series)|227]]''), although the television special ''[[The Street We Live On]]'' included archive footage of her. Reed died of breast cancer on December 17, 2009, at the age of 63.\n\nIn episode 4061 (season 35), [[Carl Gordon (actor)|Carl Gordon]] played Mr. Robinson, Gordon's father.\n\n[[Kevin Clash]] played a grown-up version of Miles in episode 2313. In this episode, Miles has a son.\n\nIn one episode, c. 1975, Susan leaves the Street for a day to visit her mother, who has taken ill, in Merton, which according to Gordon, is a few hours from New York by plane and a short train ride after landing.\n\nSusan's parents were seen in episode 2125 (season 17), in which they visited Gordon and Susan after they adopted Miles. They revisited the Street in episode 2226 (season 18), Gordon and Susan threw a party to celebrate the one-year anniversary of Miles' adoption, in which the event was reenacted with [[Big Bird]] as Gordon, [[Aloysius Snuffleupagus|Snuffy]] as Susan, and [[Elmo]] as the adoption agent. Susan's father is Lee (played by [[Bill Cobbs]]), and her mother is Dorothy ([[Frances Foster]]).

The rest of the program consists of segments relating to the episodes concepts, generally taking place elsewhere than the Street itself.</ref> ''Sesame Street'' was centered on Gordon and Susan. As per suggested by Harvard psychologist [[Jerome Kagan]], Cooney advised in ''The Potential Uses'' that a series should feature a male lead, to \"provide continuity from one segment to another, establish the tone, and function, subtly, as the master teacher.\" A male teacher would both encourage kids to emulate an intelligent adult, and \"defeminize the early learning atmosphere.\"<ref name=\"usesoftelevision\"/> The decision to create such a character was backed up by research in the US government study ''[[The Negro Family: The Case for National Action]]''. Known better as the Moynihan report, [[US Assistant Secretary of Labor|Assistant Secretary of Labor]] [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]] suggested \"the Negro community has been forced into a matriarchal structure which, because it is so out of line with the rest of the American society, seriously retards the progress of the group as a whole.\"<ref name=\"negrofamily\">Moynihan, Daniel Patrick.

Historian Robert W. Morrow defends Susan's creators, stating that their goal was presenting Gordon as a strong black male capable of supporting his family. ''Sesame Street's'' producers responded to this criticism by making Susan a nurse during the show's second season, and by introducing Gordon's sister Olivia in 1976.<ref>\n\n{{Cite book | last = Morrow | first = Robert W. | title = Sesame Street and the Reform of Children's Television | publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press | year = 2006 | location = Baltimore, Maryland | pages = [https://archive.org/details/sesamestreetrefo0000morr/page/157 157\u2013158] | isbn = 0-8018-8230-3 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/sesamestreetrefo0000morr/page/157 }}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Olivia Robinson\n| series             = [[Sesame Street]]\n| first              = 1976\n| portrayer          = [[Alaina Reed Hall]]\n| gender             = female\n}}\nActors were selected for the roles of Gordon, Susan, Bob, and Mr. Hooper by an audience of children who had watched videotaped performances.<ref name=\"unpaved\">[[David Borgenicht|Borgenicht, David]].

In a series of test pilots, Garrett Saunders played Gordon; records of his appearance were lost by producers, and his identity unknown until his family identified him in 2011.<ref name=\"PilotGordon\"/>\n\n[[Matt Robinson (actor)|Matt Robinson]] had joined [[Sesame Workshop|Children's Television Workshop]] (CTW) to assist in the development of ''Sesame Street'', producing and overseeing filmed segments focusing on the diversity of different characters on the show.

This was against his original intentions with joining the show as he preferred a behind-the-scenes role, and was initially reluctant to take the part. Dolores Robinson commented on his backseat role on the set with, \u201cHe was by nature shy, and he knew that they were having a difficult time casting Gordon.

Long's prior experience included hosting ''[[Soul!]]'', a variety series on [[National Educational Television|NET]] (later [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]). Initially, Long was a supply teacher for schools in the [[Bronx]] area, which reportedly surprised and confused many young students.<ref name=\"unpaved\"/> Long earned her doctorate in Urban Education in 1973 from the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], during the show's fourth season. Because Long had grown up on a farm in Michigan, the show's writers established that Susan had as well.\n\n===1969\u20131971===\n''Sesame Street''\u2019s first episode centers on Gordon taking a girl named Sally around Sesame Street, to get acquainted with everyone and everything in her new neighborhood.\n\n====Susan gets a job====\nFrom its inception, ''Sesame Street'' has been highly scrutinized by critics of all kinds. While the program was specially conceived to represent racial harmony, as suggested by followers of Dr. King, the \"second-wave\" [[feminist movement]] had not yet risen to prominence. [[Cynthia Eaton]] and [[Susan Chase]] of the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW) studied the series, in particular male and female interaction. NOW insisted that the program marginalized women and their role in society.\n\n\"After they presented their observations and concerns about our institutionalizing stereotypes, [[Jon Stone]] said 'Well, let's give Susan a career.'\"<ref name=\"unpaved\"/> Stone was the primary [[television director|director]] for the show. Susan became a public health nurse, who would run immunization clinics on ''Sesame Street''. Gordon also was regularly shown helping Susan with household chores. Long recalled to Cooney in 1976 that, \"I was too nice at the beginning, the great dispenser of milk and cookies.\"<ref name=\"1000hours\">Cooney, Joan Ganz.

Worthington, OH: Jones Publishing, 1972. 50\u201353.</ref>\n\nEven with the addition of [[Sonia Manzano]] as the young, single woman [[Maria Figueroa Rodriguez|Maria]] in the third season, critics still chided \"All in all, Sesame Street has changed, from being incredibly sexist to being slightly less sexist\"<ref name=\"sexjane\"/> This view was helped by characters like Betty Lou, \"a simpering, querulous little girl with pigtails and a squeaky voice\".<ref name=\"sexjane\"/>\n\n====Hip Muppet deemed stereotype====\nMatt Robinson was, however, the voice of [[Roosevelt Franklin]], a purple Muppet meant to represent an African American boy. While the skits with the character musically provided reading and writing concepts, critics found his [[African-American Vernacular English|jive]]-talking to be a [[cultural stereotype]], and the producers of the series removed him.<ref name=\"unpaved\"/> Roscoe Orman provided the voice of one of Roosevelt's classmates, Hardhat Henry Harris, before joining the series as the third actor to play Gordon. The Roosevelt Franklin Muppet occasionally turned up in multi-Muppet musical routines such as \"Clap, Clap, Clap\" and the Canadian edition of ''Sesame Street'' continued to air the Franklin segments well into the early 1980s.\n\n===1972\u20131974===\n[[Image:Sesame Street Hal Miller as Gordon with Susan and Oscar.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Miller as Gordon, with Long as Susan and Caroll Spinney as Oscar the Grouch.

Unlike Matt Robinson, Miller didn't sport a [[moustache]], and was slightly heavier-set.<ref name=\"unpaved\"/>\n\n===1974\u20132016===\n[[Roscoe Orman]] became the third Gordon in 1974, a role he kept until 2016. \"The kids who were on the show that first season would not accept me as Gordon,\" Orman remarked. \"One day there's Hal [Miller] as Gordon and the next day there's this new guy who says he's Gordon... the kids, both on the show and at home... they just assume that we are that person we're playing.\" <ref>Lance, Steven. ''Written Out of Television: A TV Lover's Guide to Cast Changes, 1945-1994''. Maryland: Madison Books, 1996.</ref>\n\n====Adopting Miles====\nIn 1985, Roscoe Orman and his wife were about to have their second child together; [[Big Bird]] puppeteer [[Caroll Spinney]] mentioned this to his wife Debra. The two went to producer [[Dulcy Singer]], suggesting that Gordon and Susan should have a child on the show. It was decided that the on-screen couple would [[adopt]], instead of Susan being [[pregnant]], and that new-born [[Miles Orman]] take the role. It was revealed that Susan had been trying to become pregnant, but to no avail due to [[infertility]]. At age seven, Miles Orman quit the series, and was replaced by child actor Imani Patterson.\n\nBefore the series of episodes where Miles is adopted, Gordon and Susan lacked last names. \"Robinson\", named after original Gordon actor Matt Robinson, was shown as Miles' last name on his adoption certificate.<ref name=\"unpaved\"/> Alternatively, Orman has suggested that the name was revealed in a different storyline aired in 1991, involving Gordon teaching in the classroom. Writers felt that the students couldn't address their teacher as \"Gordon\", so Orman suggested \"Mr. Robinson\".\n\nSimilarly, Mr. Hooper's first name was only revealed on his [[GED]]<!-- in season ##-->,<ref name=\"unpaved\"/> Bob Johnson's last name went unrevealed for years, and Gina Jefferson's last name first appeared on the door of her new [[veterinary practice]], in 2002.\n\n====Trash Gordon====\n{{Main|Trash Gordon}}\nRoscoe Orman has garnered more screen time since season 35, playing Trash Gordon, the hero of a series of bedtime stories [[Oscar the Grouch]] reads to [[Slimey the Worm]] at the end of each episode. Based on [[Flash Gordon]], Trash is an intergalactic traveller, who encounters odd creatures on each planet he visits. Trash Gordon escapes peril in each chapter, thanks to his quick thinking; when a living pile of rotten bananas confronts Trash, for example, it is soon chased away by an \"Intergalactical Monkey\" he happened to have with him.<ref name=\"Trashmonkey\">''Sesame Street'' episode 4061, first broadcast in 2005, on PBS.</ref>\n\n====Recent appearances====\n[[Image:Roscoe orman 2007.jpg|thumb|left|Roscoe Orman has played Gordon from 1974 to 2016. He is seen here at the 2007 [[Texas Book Festival]] in [[Austin, Texas]].]]\nLooking back on his role, over the last 33 years, Orman commented \"If I could boast of no other major career accomplishment, having played a central role as I have in the development and continuation of this landmark series would alone have made my life sufficiently meaningful. The historical significance of Sesame Street and its surprising longevity have made my association with the show, in many regards, my life's crowning achievement.\"<ref name=\"sesamedad\"/> However, Orman doesn't credit ''Sesame Street'' as having defined himself personally and his overall career; The [[Free Southern Theater]] of New Orleans and [[The New Lafayette Theatre]] of Harlem collectively take that honor.\n\nBy 2002, Imani Patterson left his role as Miles, and was replaced by actor [[Olamide Faison]]. As a recording artist of the mildly successful hip-hop group [[Imajin (R&B group)|Imajin]],<ref>[http://www.sesameworkshop.org/aboutus/pressroom/presskits/season37/cast_bios.php#bios_5 Sesame Street - Season 37 Press Kit - Cast Bios<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Faison could be used more frequently as a singer on the series. Plot lines like season 36 episode 4089 focused on Miles singing numerous 1960s-style parody songs for ''[[American Bandstand|American Fruitstand]]''.\n\nIn episode 4112 (2006), Miles graduated [[high school]] alongside Gabi, despite the fact that the characters' respective births on the show occurred four years apart. A flashback in this episode also revealed that Miles was shy on his first day of school.\n\n[[Loretta Long]] and [[Bob McGrath]] are the only two remaining non-puppeteer actors on ''Sesame Street'' from its first episode, as Orman's contract for the show expired, and [[Will Lee]] (Mr. Hooper) died in 1982. While neither actor has appeared in a significant number of episodes since about season 38, the longevity of their roles are with few precedents. Of the Muppets from the first episode&mdash;[[Big Bird]], [[Oscar the Grouch]], [[Kermit the Frog]], [[Cookie Monster]], and [[Bert and Ernie]]&mdash;all except Kermit are still major characters on the show. However, [[Jim Henson]] (Kermit, Ernie) died, with [[Steve Whitmire]] playing Ernie (Kermit no longer appears); [[Frank Oz]], busy as a director, now only puppets Grover, Bert, and Cookie Monster a couple of times each season ([[David Rudman]] and [[Eric Jacobson]] have largely taken over his characters); and [[Caroll Spinney]] retired in 2018, handing over the role of Big Bird to [[Matt Vogel (puppeteer)|Matt Vogel]], and Oscar the Grouch to Jacobson.\n\nOn July 28, 2016, it was announced that Gordon would be dropped from the show as Orman's contract was not renewed as part of Sesame Workshop's re-tooling for the series.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Kevin L.|title=\u2018Sesame Street\u2019 Lets Go Longtime Cast Members Bob, Gordon and Luis |url=http://ww2.kqed.org/arts/2016/07/27/sesame-street-lets-go-longtime-cast-members-bob-gordon-and-luis/|website=KQED Public Media for Northern California |accessdate=28 July 2016}}</ref> Following his departure, the workshop stated that Orman would continue to represent them at public events.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lujan|first1=Adam|title=Sesame Street let go three longtime cast members|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/07/28/sesame-street-cast-changes-hbo |website=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=28 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Birthdays===\nSince ''Sesame Street Magazine'' published calendars in every issue, character birthdays were established.

Olivia was a photographer and last appeared on the show in 1988 (so Reed could work on the TV sitcom ''[[227 (TV series)|227]]''), although the television special ''[[The Street We Live On]]'' included archive footage of her. Reed died of breast cancer on December 17, 2009, at the age of 63.\n\nIn episode 4061 (season 35), [[Carl Gordon (actor)|Carl Gordon]] played Mr. Robinson, Gordon's father.\n\n[[Kevin Clash]] played a grown-up version of Miles in episode 2313. In this episode, Miles has a son.\n\nIn one episode, c. 1975, Susan leaves the Street for a day to visit her mother, who has taken ill, in Merton, which according to Gordon, is a few hours from New York by plane and a short train ride after landing.\n\nSusan's parents were seen in episode 2125 (season 17), in which they visited Gordon and Susan after they adopted Miles. They revisited the Street in episode 2226 (season 18), Gordon and Susan threw a party to celebrate the one-year anniversary of Miles' adoption, in which the event was reenacted with [[Big Bird]] as Gordon, [[Aloysius Snuffleupagus|Snuffy]] as Susan, and [[Elmo]] as the adoption agent. Susan's father is Lee (played by [[Bill Cobbs]]), and her mother is Dorothy ([[Frances Foster]]). Her parents came back for another visit in episode 2820 (season 22), in which the short-lived character Preston Rabbit was also a guest at the Robinson's apartment.\n\nAdded to the show in 2007 was Gordon and Susan's nephew, Chris Robinson, played by actor [[Chris Knowings]].

Gordon and Susan, as well as other humans on the series have been included in various books, particularly during the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nDuring the early years, Susan often sang \"[[One of These Things]]\". She also headlined her own album, ''[[Susan Sings Songs from Sesame Street]]'', and had minor roles in both ''Sesame Street'' movies.\n\nRobinson and Long appeared in the original ''[[Sesame Street Live]]'' touring production, while Orman and Long make occasional appearances in and out of character.

Later, partially shaded party patios were constructed in the right field corner; these patios can be reserved by fans who may bring in food and beverages, including beer and wine, to the patios.\n\n===2014\u201315 Player Development Center Addition===\nAdditions and renovations in 2014 and 2015 totaled $2.5 million and added the G.
