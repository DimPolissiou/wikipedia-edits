He was known for being a pioneering black umpire, for his longtime weight problems, and for his controversial home plate umpiring in Game 5 of the [[1997 National League Championship Series]]\u2014when his generous strike zone helped the [[Florida Marlins|Florida Marlins']] [[Liv\u00e1n Hern\u00e1ndez]] strike out 15 Atlanta batters.<ref>''New York Times'', June 6, 2006 https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/06/sports/06gregg.html</ref> Throughout his National League career, Gregg wore uniform number 7.\n\n==Umpiring career==\nGregg was born in [[Philadelphia|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. His major league career began at the age of 24, making him one of the youngest umpires in big league history. \n\nHe was only the third black umpire in the big leagues, following [[Emmett Ashford]] and [[Art Williams (umpire)|Art Williams]]. He officiated in the [[1989 World Series]], and was the third base umpire for Game 3, which was postponed due to the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake|Loma Prieta earthquake]], but since the series ended in four games, he did not get to work behind home plate, as happened to Ashford in the [[1970 World Series]]. He also worked in four [[National League Championship Series]] ([[1981 National League Championship Series|1981]], [[1987 National League Championship Series|1987]], [[1991 National League Championship Series|1991]], [[1997 National League Championship Series|1997]]), as well as the [[1995 National League Division Series|1995]] and [[1996 National League Division Series]] and the [[1986 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1986 All-Star Game]] at the [[Reliant Astrodome|Houston Astrodome]]. \n\nHe was the home plate umpire for two [[no-hitter]]s ([[Terry Mulholland]] in [[1990 in baseball|1990]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/PHI/PHI199008150.shtml|title=August 15, 1990 San Francisco Giants at Philadelphia Phillies Box Score and Play by Play|accessdate=2009-04-07|work=[[Baseball-Reference]]|publisher=Sports Reference LLC}}</ref> and [[Ram\u00f3n Mart\u00ednez (pitcher)|Ram\u00f3n Mart\u00ednez]] in [[1995 in baseball|1995]]) and worked third base for [[Tom Browning]]'s [[Tom Browning's perfect game|perfect game]] on September 16, 1988. On August 8, [[1988 Chicago Cubs season|1988]], Gregg was the home plate umpire for the first night game at [[Wrigley Field]]. The [[1988 Philadelphia Phillies season|Phillies]] and Cubs were rained out and the first official game was played August 9, 1988. \n\nGregg was the subject of controversy for his large strike zone during Game 5 of the [[1997 NLCS]], where [[Marlins]] pitcher [[Livan Hernandez]] recorded a career high 15 strikeouts against Atlanta.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Olney |first1=Buster |title=LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES; An Outside Chance: Hernandez's 15 Strikeouts Put the Marlins in Control |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/13/sports/league-championship-series-outside-chance-hernandez-s-15-strikeouts-put-marlins.html |work=The New York Times |date=October 13, 1997}}</ref> His work in the game was voted by Baseball America as the third-worst umpire performance of the 1975\u20132000 era.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wilkinson |first1=Jack |title=100 Things Braves Fans Should Know & Do Before They Die |date=April 2, 2019 |publisher=Triumph Books |isbn=1641252170}}</ref> Gregg continued to umpire in 1998 and a portion of the 1999 season, but was not selected for post season duties again.\n\n===Resignation===\nGregg was one of 22 umpires who [[1999 Major League Umpires Association mass resignation|resigned]] in {{baseball year|1999}} as part of a labor action. [[Richie Phillips]], executive director of the [[Major League Umpires Association|umpires' union]]<!--The WUA is the union which replaced the MLUA-->, felt that Major League Baseball might reconsider its stance in contract negotiations rather than doling out millions of dollars in severance pay. Instead, the MLB chose to accept the resignations, though they later rehired several of those who had resigned. On August 7, 2001, Rep. [[Bob Brady|Robert A. Brady]], a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]], wrote a letter with 25 other House members urging [[Commissioner of Baseball|Commissioner]] [[Bud Selig]] to rehire Gregg, but Selig refused.<ref name=\"letter\">{{cite news|publisher=usatoday.com|title=House Members Urge Selig to Reinstate Umpire|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/stories/2001-08-07-gregg.htm|accessdate=8 November 2006|date=August 8, 2001}}</ref>\n\n==Weight problems==\nGregg battled weight troubles throughout his career, eventually leading to his famous nickname \"The Plump Ump\". His weight was generally listed between 315 and 325 pounds, but Gregg admitted that this was often an understatement and that he frequently approached 400 pounds.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} In {{baseball year|1996}}, fellow umpire [[John McSherry]] died in [[Cinergy Field|Cincinnati]] of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]]; the two had planned for a long time to try to lose weight together, but McSherry's death motivated Gregg to take a leave of absence from umpiring and enter a program at [[Duke University]]. Actor [[Bill Murray]] once quipped about Gregg that \"he looked like the Michelin Man. If he had to haul ass right now, he'd have to make about 6 trips.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1008499/2/index.htm |title=well off the plate |last=Lidz |first=Franz |date=August 5, 1996 |work=[[Sports Illustrated]] |accessdate=16 June 2001}}</ref>\n\nHis frame, still hefty and recognizable despite the weight loss, encouraged publicity for Gregg. He was honorary commissioner of the [[Wing Bowl]], an annual [[competitive eating]] event in Philadelphia, and also umped at various celebrity softball events. He also occasionally worked at [[Chickie's & Pete's]] Philadelphia restaurant and at the restaurant's stand at [[Veterans Stadium]] as a [[bartender]] and server. Aside from his girth, he was also well known for his jocular personality and wide smile, which had a disarming effect on game participants who took issue with his calls.\n\nIn 1999, he was fined $5,000 by the National League for exceeding a 300-pound weight limit.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://archives.citypaper.net/articles/082699/feat.cov1.shtml |title=Interview with the Umpire |last=Altman |first=Howard |date=August 26, 1999 |work=[[Philadelphia City Paper]] |accessdate=16 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910094601/http://archives.citypaper.net/articles/082699/feat.cov1.shtml |archivedate=10 September 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nOn December 31, 1974, he married Conchita Camilo, with whom he had four children.\n\nHis autobiography, ''Working the Plate'' (written with [[Marty Appel]]), was published in [[1990 in literature|1990]].\n\nGregg's son Kevin has worked with numerous sports teams in the public relations department, and currently serves with the [[Boston Red Sox]] as Vice President of Media Relations.  Son Eric Joseito was well-known as a lacrosse coach before becoming an account executive at [[Dell EMC]] in the Philadelphia area.

He was known for being a pioneering black umpire, for his longtime weight problems, and for his controversial home plate umpiring in Game 5 of the [[1997 National League Championship Series]]\u2014when his generous strike zone helped the [[Florida Marlins|Florida Marlins']] [[Liv\u00e1n Hern\u00e1ndez]] strike out 15 Atlanta batters.<ref>''New York Times'', June 6, 2006 https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/06/sports/06gregg.html</ref> Throughout his National League career, Gregg wore uniform number 7.\n\n==Umpiring career==\nGregg was born in [[Philadelphia|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. His major league career began at the age of 24, making him one of the youngest umpires in big league history. \n\nHe was only the third black umpire in the big leagues, following [[Emmett Ashford]] and [[Art Williams (umpire)|Art Williams]]. He officiated in the [[1989 World Series]], and was the third base umpire for Game 3, which was postponed due to the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake|Loma Prieta earthquake]], but since the series ended in four games, he did not get to work behind home plate, as happened to Ashford in the [[1970 World Series]]. He also worked in four [[National League Championship Series]] ([[1981 National League Championship Series|1981]], [[1987 National League Championship Series|1987]], [[1991 National League Championship Series|1991]], [[1997 National League Championship Series|1997]]), as well as the [[1995 National League Division Series|1995]] and [[1996 National League Division Series]] and the [[1986 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1986 All-Star Game]] at the [[Reliant Astrodome|Houston Astrodome]]. \n\nHe was the home plate umpire for two [[no-hitter]]s ([[Terry Mulholland]] in [[1990 in baseball|1990]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/PHI/PHI199008150.shtml|title=August 15, 1990 San Francisco Giants at Philadelphia Phillies Box Score and Play by Play|accessdate=2009-04-07|work=[[Baseball-Reference]]|publisher=Sports Reference LLC}}</ref> and [[Ram\u00f3n Mart\u00ednez (pitcher)|Ram\u00f3n Mart\u00ednez]] in [[1995 in baseball|1995]]) and worked third base for [[Tom Browning]]'s [[Tom Browning's perfect game|perfect game]] on September 16, 1988. On August 8, [[1988 Chicago Cubs season|1988]], Gregg was the home plate umpire for the first night game at [[Wrigley Field]]. The [[1988 Philadelphia Phillies season|Phillies]] and Cubs were rained out and the first official game was played August 9, 1988. \n\nGregg was the subject of controversy for his large strike zone during Game 5 of the [[1997 NLCS]], where [[Marlins]] pitcher [[Livan Hernandez]] recorded a career high 15 strikeouts against Atlanta.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Olney |first1=Buster |title=LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES; An Outside Chance: Hernandez's 15 Strikeouts Put the Marlins in Control |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/13/sports/league-championship-series-outside-chance-hernandez-s-15-strikeouts-put-marlins.html |work=The New York Times |date=October 13, 1997}}</ref> His work in the game was voted by Baseball America as the third-worst umpire performance of the 1975\u20132000 era.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wilkinson |first1=Jack |title=100 Things Braves Fans Should Know & Do Before They Die |date=April 2, 2019 |publisher=Triumph Books |isbn=1641252170}}</ref> Gregg continued to umpire in 1998 and a portion of the 1999 season, but was not selected for post season duties again.\n\n===Resignation===\nGregg was one of 22 umpires who [[1999 Major League Umpires Association mass resignation|resigned]] in {{baseball year|1999}} as part of a labor action. [[Richie Phillips]], executive director of the [[Major League Umpires Association|umpires' union]]<!--The WUA is the union which replaced the MLUA-->, felt that Major League Baseball might reconsider its stance in contract negotiations rather than doling out millions of dollars in severance pay. Instead, the MLB chose to accept the resignations, though they later rehired several of those who had resigned. On August 7, 2001, Rep. [[Bob Brady|Robert A.

His weight was generally listed between 315 and 325 pounds, but Gregg admitted that this was often an understatement and that he frequently approached 400 pounds.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} In {{baseball year|1996}}, fellow umpire [[John McSherry]] died in [[Cinergy Field|Cincinnati]] of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]]; the two had planned for a long time to try to lose weight together, but McSherry's death motivated Gregg to take a leave of absence from umpiring and enter a program at [[Duke University]].

He was honorary commissioner of the [[Wing Bowl]], an annual [[competitive eating]] event in Philadelphia, and also umped at various celebrity softball events. He also occasionally worked at [[Chickie's & Pete's]] Philadelphia restaurant and at the restaurant's stand at [[Veterans Stadium]] as a [[bartender]] and server. Aside from his girth, he was also well known for his jocular personality and wide smile, which had a disarming effect on game participants who took issue with his calls.\n\nIn 1999, he was fined $5,000 by the National League for exceeding a 300-pound weight limit.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://archives.citypaper.net/articles/082699/feat.cov1.shtml |title=Interview with the Umpire |last=Altman |first=Howard |date=August 26, 1999 |work=[[Philadelphia City Paper]] |accessdate=16 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910094601/http://archives.citypaper.net/articles/082699/feat.cov1.shtml |archivedate=10 September 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nOn December 31, 1974, he married Conchita Camilo, with whom he had four children.\n\nHis autobiography, ''Working the Plate'' (written with [[Marty Appel]]), was published in [[1990 in literature|1990]].\n\nGregg's son Kevin has worked with numerous sports teams in the public relations department, and currently serves with the [[Boston Red Sox]] as Vice President of Media Relations.

Due to this, they survive approximately two weeks.<ref>[http://mncable.net/~petehonl/cecropia/ Cecropia Moth \u2014 Life Cycle]</ref>\n\n'''Mating'''\nTo find a mate, the female cecropia moth emits [[pheromones]] which the male detects with its sensitive antennae. Male cecropia moths can detect these pheromones from up to a mile away, although a male may fly up to 7 miles while searching for a female. Mating typically begins early in the morning hours and lasts until the evening.\n\n'''Eggs'''\nAfter mating, the female will lay up to one hundred eggs. These eggs are a mottled reddish brown and are usually found on either side of a host leaf. These eggs will eventually hatch into tiny black caterpillars.\n\n'''Larvae'''\nThere are typically five larval [[instar]]s (developmental stages), each lasting approximately one week. The first instar [[larvae]] are black. Their coloration is due to small black hairs growing from [[tubercles]] (small projections) all over their body. These larvae feed upon many common trees and shrubs including maple, birch, and apple.<ref>[http://www.nhptv.org/natureworks/cecropiamoth.htm Cecropia Moth - ''Hyalophora cecropia'']</ref> As the caterpillars grow larger into the second larval instar, they become yellow green. During the third, fourth, and fifth instars, The cecropia moth becomes rather large and bluish green.

They are usually quite large, with a wingspan of about {{convert|5|to|7|in|mm}}. The cecropia moth's wings are brownish with red near the base of the forewing. There are crescent-shaped spots of red with whitish centers on all wings, but are larger on the hindwings. All wings have whitish coloration followed by reddish bands of shading beyond the postmedial line that runs longitudinally down the center of all four wings. The body is hairy, with reddish coloring on the anterior, and fading to reddish/whitish.

The eggs then hatch into larvae, which consume the internal organs and muscles of the caterpillars. The parasitoid releases chemicals that override the regulatory mechanisms of the caterpillar. Once the parasitoid has grown enough, it induces the caterpillar to pupate. Once the caterpillars pupate, the parasitoid larvae themselves pupate, killing the cecropia pupa.<ref>{{cite web |title=Parasites, Predators and Parasitoids |url=https://mothphotographersgroup.msstate.edu/MothTalkDownload/MothTalk015.htm |website=Moth Photographers Group |accessdate=September 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Squirrel]]s also consume the pupae of cecropia moths, which can decrease the populations significantly.\n\nPruning of trees and leaving outdoor lights on at night can also be detrimental to cecropia moths.\n\n''[[Compsilura concinnata]]'', introduced to North America to control invasive [[Lymantria dispar dispar|European gypsy moths]], is a particular threat to the native North American cecropia moth.<ref>{{cite book| url=https://wiki.bugwood.org/uploads/Ch2.pdf| title= The Effects of ''Compsilura concinnata'', an Introduced Generalist Tachinid, on Non-Target Species in North America: A Cautionary Tale |last1= Elkinton| first1= J.

The eggs then hatch into larvae, which consume the internal organs and muscles of the caterpillars. The parasitoid releases chemicals that override the regulatory mechanisms of the caterpillar. Once the parasitoid has grown enough, it induces the caterpillar to pupate.  Once the caterpillars pupate, the parasitoid larvae themselves pupate, killing the cecropia pupa.<ref>{{cite web |title=Parasites, Predators and Parasitoids |url=https://mothphotographersgroup.msstate.edu/MothTalkDownload/MothTalk015.htm |website=Moth Photographers Group |accessdate=September 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Squirrel]]s also consume the pupae of cecropia moths, which can decrease the populations significantly.\n\nPruning of trees and leaving outdoor lights on at night can also be detrimental to cecropia moths.\n\n''[[Compsilura concinnata]]'', introduced to North America to control invasive [[Lymantria dispar dispar|European gypsy moths]], is a particular threat to the native North American cecropia moth.<ref>{{cite book| url=https://wiki.bugwood.org/uploads/Ch2.pdf| title= The Effects of ''Compsilura concinnata'', an Introduced Generalist Tachinid, on Non-Target Species in North America: A Cautionary Tale |last1= Elkinton| first1= J.

Over time, the federal courts have developed a body of law under the Sherman Act making certain types of anticompetitive conduct per se illegal, and subjecting other types of conduct to case-by-case analysis regarding whether the conduct unreasonably restrains trade.\n\nThe law attempts to prevent the artificial raising of prices by restriction of trade or supply.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://butnowyouknow.net/those-who-fail-to-learn-from-history/sherman-anti-trust-act-and-analysis/|title=Sherman AntiTrust Act, and Analysis|date=12 March 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20111118040849/http://butnowyouknow.net/those-who-fail-to-learn-from-history/sherman-anti-trust-act-and-analysis/|archivedate=18 November 2011}}</ref> \"Innocent monopoly\", or [[monopoly]] achieved solely by merit, is perfectly legal, but acts by a monopolist to artificially preserve that status, or nefarious dealings to create a monopoly, are not.

The denial by employers of the right of employees to organize and the refusal by employers to accept the procedure of collective bargaining lead to strikes and other forms of industrial strife or unrest, which have the intent or the necessary effect of burdening or obstructing commerce. . . .\"\n\nThe Anti-Racketeering Act, 48 Stat. 979, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 420a-420e (1934), is designed to protect trade and commerce against interference by violence and threats. \u00a7 420a provides that\n\n\"any person who, in connection with or in relation to any act in any way or in any degree affecting trade or commerce or any article or commodity moving or about to move in trade or commerce --\"\n\n\"(a) Obtains or attempts to obtain, by the use of or attempt to use or threat to use force, violence, or coercion, the payment of money or other valuable considerations . . . not including, however, the payment of wages by a bonafide employer to a bona fide employee; or\"\n\n\"(b) Obtains the property of another, with his consent, induced by wrongful use of force or fear, or under color of official right; or\"\n\n\"(c) Commits or threatens to commit an act of physical violence or physical injury to a person or property in furtherance of a plan or purpose to violate subsections (a) or (b); or\"\n\n\"(d) Conspires or acts concertedly with any other person or persons to commit any of the foregoing acts; shall, upon conviction thereof, be guilty of a felony and shall be punished by imprisonment from one to ten years or by a fine of $10,000 or both.\"\n\nBut the application of the provisions of \u00a7 420a to labor unions is restricted by \u00a7 420d, which provides:\n\n\"Jurisdiction of offenses. Any person charged with violating section 420a of this title may be prosecuted in any district in which any part of the offense has been committed by him or by his actual associates participating with him in the offense or by his fellow conspirators: ''Provided,'' That no court of the United States shall construe or apply any of the provisions of sections 420a to 420e of this title in such manner as to impair, diminish, or in any manner affect the rights of bona fide labor organizations in lawfully carrying out the legitimate objects thereof, as such rights are expressed in existing statutes of the United States.\"\n\nIt is significant that Chapter 9 of the Criminal Code, dealing with \"Offenses Against Foreign And Interstate Commerce\" and relating specifically to acts of interstate transportation or its obstruction, makes no mention of the Sherman Act, which is made a part of the Code which deals with social, economic and commercial results of interstate activity, notwithstanding its criminal penalty.\"\n\n</ref> The law was enacted in the era of \"trusts\" and of \"combinations\" of businesses and of capital organized and directed to control of the market by suppression of competition in the marketing of goods and services, the monopolistic tendency of which had become a matter of public concern. The goal was to prevent restraints of free competition in business and commercial transactions which tended to restrict production, raise prices, or otherwise control the market to the detriment of purchasers or consumers of goods and services, all of which had come to be regarded as a special form of public injury.<ref>Footnote 15 appears here:\n\n\"The history of the Sherman Act, as contained in the legislative proceedings, is emphatic in its support for the conclusion that \"business competition\" was the problem considered, and that the act was designed to prevent restraints of trade which had a significant effect on such competition.\n\nOn July 10, 1888, the Senate adopted without discussion a resolution offered by Senator Sherman which directed the Committee on Finance to inquire into, and report in connection with, revenue bills\n\n\"such measures as it may deem expedient to set aside, control, restrain or prohibit all arrangements, contracts, agreements, trusts, or combinations between persons or corporations, made with a view, or which tend to prevent ''free and full competition'' . . . with such penalties and provisions . . . as will tend to preserve freedom of trade and production, the natural competition of increasing production, the lowering of prices by such competition . . .\"\n\n(19 Cong.Rec. 6041).\n\nThis resolution explicitly presented the economic theory of the proponents of such legislation. The various bills introduced between 1888 and 1890 follow the theory of this resolution. Many bills sought to make void all arrangements\n\n\"made with a view, or which tend, to prevent full and free competition in the production, manufacture, or sale of articles of domestic growth or production, . . .\"\n\nS. 3445; S. 3510; H.R. 11339; all of the 50th Cong., 1st Sess. (1888) were bills of this type. In the 51st Cong. (1889), the bills were in a similar vein. ''See'' S. 1, sec. 1 (this bill as redrafted by the Judiciary Committee ultimately became the Sherman Law); H.R. 202, sec. 3; H.R. 270; H.R. 286; H.R. 402; H.R. 509; H.R. 826; H.R. 3819. ''See'' Bills and Debates in Congress relating to Trusts (1909), Vol. 1, pp. 1025\u20131031.\n\nOnly one, which was never enacted, S. 1268 in the 52d Cong., 1st Sess. (1892), introduced by Senator Peffer, sought to prohibit\n\n\"every willful act . . . which shall have the effect to in any way interfere with the freedom of transit of articles in interstate commerce, . . .\"\n\nWhen the antitrust bill (S. 1, 51st Cong., 1st Sess.) came before Congress for debate, the debates point to a similar purpose.

Section 1 delineates and prohibits specific means of anticompetitive conduct, while Section 2 deals with end results that are anti-competitive in nature. Thus, these sections supplement each other in an effort to prevent businesses from violating the spirit of the Act, while technically remaining within the letter of the law. Section 3 simply extends the provisions of Section 1 to U.S. territories and the District of Columbia.\n\n{{quote|Section 1:\n:Every contract, combination in the form of [[Trust (19th century)|trust]] or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal.<ref>See {{usc|15|1}}.</ref>\nSection 2:\n:Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a felony [. . . ]<ref>See {{usc|15|2}}.</ref>}}\n\n====Subsequent legislation expanding its scope====\nThe [[Clayton Antitrust Act]], passed in 1914, proscribes certain additional activities that had been discovered to fall outside the scope of the Sherman Antitrust Act. For example, the Clayton Act added certain practices to the list of impermissible activities:\n* price discrimination between different purchasers, if such discrimination tends to create a monopoly\n* exclusive dealing agreements\n* tying arrangements\n* mergers and acquisitions that substantially reduce market competition.\n\nThe [[Robinson\u2013Patman Act]] of 1936 amended the Clayton Act. The amendment proscribed certain anti-competitive practices in which manufacturers engaged in price discrimination against equally-situated distributors.\n\n==Legacy==\n{{main|History of United States antitrust law}}\nThe federal government began filing cases under the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890.

Dental Ass'n'', 526 U.S. at 770.</ref> Taking a \"quick look,\" economic harm is presumed from the questionable nature of the conduct, and the burden is shifted to the defendant to prove harmlessness or justification. The quick-look became a popular way of disposing of cases where the conduct was in a grey area between illegality \"per se\" and demonstrable harmfulness under the \"rule of reason\".\n\n===Modern trends===\n\n====Inference of conspiracy====\nA modern trend has increased difficulty for antitrust plaintiffs as courts have come to hold plaintiffs to increasing burdens of pleading. Under older Section 1 precedent, it was not settled how much evidence was required to show a conspiracy. For example, a conspiracy could be inferred based on parallel conduct, etc. That is, plaintiffs were only required to show that a conspiracy was conceivable. Since the 1970s, however, courts have held plaintiffs to higher standards, giving antitrust defendants an opportunity to resolve cases in their favor before significant discovery under [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure|FRCP]] 12(b)(6). That is, to overcome a [[Motion in United States law|motion to dismiss]], plaintiffs, under ''[[Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly]]'', must plead facts consistent with [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure|FRCP]] 8(a) sufficient to show that a conspiracy is plausible (and not merely conceivable or possible). This protects defendants from bearing the costs of antitrust \"fishing expeditions\"; however it deprives plaintiffs of perhaps their only tool to acquire evidence (discovery).\n\n=====Manipulation of market=====\nSecond, courts have employed more sophisticated and principled definitions of markets. Market definition is necessary, in rule of reason cases, for the plaintiff to prove a conspiracy is harmful. It is also necessary for the plaintiff to establish the market relationship between conspirators to prove their conduct is within the per se rule.\n\nIn early cases, it was easier for plaintiffs to show market relationship, or dominance, by tailoring market definition, even if it ignored fundamental principles of economics. In ''[[U.S. v. Grinnell]]'', 384 U.S. 563 (1966), the trial judge, [[Charles Wyzanski]], composed the market only of alarm companies with services in every state, tailoring out any local competitors; the defendant stood alone in this market, but had the court added up the entire national market, it would have had a much smaller share of the national market for alarm services that the court purportedly used. The appellate courts affirmed this finding; however, today, an appellate court would likely find this definition to be flawed. Modern courts use a more sophisticated market definition that does not permit as manipulative a definition.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\n===Monopoly===\nSection 2 of the Act forbade monopoly. In Section 2 cases, the court has, again on its own initiative, drawn a distinction between [[Coercive monopoly|coercive]] and innocent monopoly. The act is not meant to punish businesses that come to dominate their market passively or on their own merit, only those that intentionally dominate the market through misconduct, which generally consists of conspiratorial conduct of the kind forbidden by Section 1 of the Sherman Act, or Section 3 of the Clayton Act.\n\n===Application of the act outside pure commerce===\nThe Act was aimed at regulating businesses. However, its application was not limited to the commercial side of business. Its prohibition of the cartel was also interpreted to make illegal many labor union activities. This is because unions were characterized as cartels as well (cartels of laborers).<ref>See {{ussc|name=Loewe v. Lawlor|link=|volume=208|page=274|pin=|year=1908}}.</ref> This persisted until 1914, when the [[Clayton Antitrust Act|Clayton Act]] created exceptions for certain union activities.\n\n==Preemption by Section 1 of state statutes that restrain competition==\n{{Main|Sherman Antitrust Act (federal preemption)}}\nTo determine whether a particular state statute that restrains competition was intended to be preempted by the Act, courts will engage in a two-step analysis, as set forth by the Supreme Court in ''[[Rice v. Norman Williams Co.]]'':\n* First, they will inquire whether the state legislation \"mandates or authorizes conduct that necessarily constitutes a violation of the antitrust laws in all cases, or ... places irresistible pressure on a private party to violate the antitrust laws in order to comply with the statute.\" ''[[Rice v. Norman Williams Co.]]'', 458 U.S. 654, 661; see also ''[[324 Liquor Corp. v. Duffy]]'', 479 U.S. 335 (1987) (\"Our decisions reflect the principle that the federal antitrust laws pre-empt state laws authorizing or compelling private parties to engage in anticompetitive behavior.\")\n* Second, they will consider whether the state statute is saved from preemption by the [[state action immunity doctrine]] (aka ''Parker'' immunity). In ''[[California Retail Liquor Dealers Association v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc.]]'', 445 U.S. 97, 105 (1980), the Supreme Court established a two-part test for applying the doctrine: \"First, the challenged restraint must be one clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state policy; second, the policy must be actively supervised by the State itself.\" Id. (citation and quotation marks omitted).\n\n== Criticism ==\n{{See also|United States antitrust law|Competition law}}\n[[Alan Greenspan]], in his essay entitled ''Antitrust''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.polyconomics.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1605:antitrust-by-alan-greenspan&catid=47:1998 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-19 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140510124441/http://www.polyconomics.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1605:antitrust-by-alan-greenspan&catid=47:1998 |archivedate=2014-05-10 }}</ref> described the Sherman Act as stifling innovation and harming society. \"No one will ever know what new products, processes, machines, and cost-saving mergers failed to come into existence, killed by the Sherman Act before they were born. No one can ever compute the price that all of us have paid for that Act which, by inducing less effective use of capital, has kept our standard of living lower than would otherwise have been possible.\" Greenspan summarized the nature of antitrust law as: \"a jumble of economic irrationality and ignorance.\"<ref>Criticisms such as this one, attributed to Greenspan, are not directed at the Sherman act in particular, but rather at the underlying policy of all antitrust law, which includes several pieces of legislation other than just the Sherman Act, e.g. the [[Clayton Antitrust Act]].</ref>\n\nGreenspan at that time was a disciple and friend of [[Ayn Rand]], and he first published ''Antitrust'' in Rand's monthly publication ''The Objectivist Newsletter.'' Rand, who described herself as \"a radical for capitalism,\"<ref>''Check Your Premises,'' The Objectivist Newsletter, January 1962, vol. 1, no. 1, p. 1</ref> opposed antitrust law not only on economic grounds but also morally, as a violation of property rights, asserting that the \"meaning and purpose\" of antitrust law is \"the penalizing of ability for being ability, the penalizing of success for being success, and the sacrifice of productive genius to the demands of envious mediocrity.\"<ref>''Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal,'' Ch. 3, New American Library, Signet, 1967</ref>\n\nIn 1890, [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[William E. Mason|William Mason]] said \"trusts have made products cheaper, have reduced prices; but if the price of oil, for instance, were reduced to one cent a barrel, it would not right the wrong done to people of this country by the trusts which have destroyed legitimate competition and driven honest men from legitimate business enterprise.\"<ref>Congressional Record, 51st Congress, 1st session, House, June 20, 1890, p. 4100.</ref> Consequently, if the primary goal of the act is to protect consumers, and consumers are protected by lower prices, the act may be harmful if it reduces [[economy of scale]], a price-lowering mechanism, by breaking up big businesses. Mason put small business survival, a justice interest, on a level concomitant with the pure economic rationale of consumer \n\nEconomist [[Thomas DiLorenzo]] notes that Senator Sherman sponsored the 1890 [[William McKinley]] tariff just three months after the Sherman Act, and agrees with ''[[The New York Times]]'' which wrote on October 1, 1890: \"That so-called Anti-Trust law was passed to deceive the people and to clear the way for the enactment of this Pro-Trust law relating to the tariff.\" The ''Times'' went on to assert that Sherman merely supported this \"humbug\" of a law \"in order that party organs might say...'Behold! We have attacked the trusts.

Another conservative legal scholar and judge, [[Richard Posner]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|Seventh Circuit]], does not condemn the entire regime, but expresses concern with the potential that it could be applied to create inefficiency, rather than to avoid inefficiency.<ref name=posner>Richard Posner, ''Economic Analysis of Law'', p. 295 et seq. (explaining the optimal antitrust regime from an economic point of view)</ref> Posner further believes, along with a number of others, including Bork, that genuinely inefficient cartels and coercive monopolies, the target of the act, would be self-corrected by market forces, making the strict penalties of antitrust legislation unnecessary.<ref name=posner />\n\nConversely, liberal [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] Justice [[William O. Douglas]] criticized the judiciary for interpreting and enforcing the antitrust law unequally: \"From the beginning it [the Sherman Act] has been applied by judges hostile to its purposes, friendly to the empire builders who wanted it emasculated... trusts that were dissolved reintegrated in new forms... It is ironic that the Sherman Act was truly effective in only one respect, and that was when it was applied to labor unions.  Then the courts read it with a literalness that never appeared in their other decisions.\"<ref>Douglas, William O., An Almanac of Liberty, Doubleday & Company, 1954, p. 189</ref>\n\nAccording to a 2018 study in the journal ''Public Choice'', \"Senator John Sherman of Ohio was motivated to introduce an antitrust bill in late 1889 partly as a way of enacting revenge on his political rival, General and former Governor Russell Alger of Michigan, because Sherman believed that Alger personally had cost him the presidential nomination at the 1888 Republican national convention... Sherman was able to pursue his revenge motive by combining it with the broader Republican goals of preserving high tariffs and attacking the trusts.\"<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Newman |first=Patrick |date=2018-01-12 |title=Revenge: John Sherman, Russell Alger and the origins of the Sherman Act |journal=Public Choice |volume=174 |issue=3\u20134 |language=en |pages=257\u2013275 |doi=10.1007/s11127-017-0497-x |issn=0048-5829}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Alcoa]]\n* [[American Bar Association]]\n* [[American Tobacco Company]]\n* [[Antitrust]]\n* [[Bell System divestiture]]\n* [[Cartel]]\n* [[Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914]]\n* [[DRAM price fixing]]\n* [[George Howard Earle, Jr.|George H.

It is named for Sen. [[John Sherman]], its principal author.\n\nThe Sherman Act broadly prohibits (1) anticompetitive agreements and (2) unilateral conduct that monopolizes or attempts to monopolize the relevant market. The Act authorizes the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] to bring [[Lawsuit|suits]] to [[enjoin]] (i.e. prohibit) conduct violating the Act, and additionally authorizes private parties injured by conduct violating the Act to bring suits for [[treble damages]] (i.e. three times as much money in damages as the violation cost them). Over time, the federal courts have developed a body of law under the Sherman Act making certain types of anticompetitive conduct per se illegal, and subjecting other types of conduct to case-by-case analysis regarding whether the conduct unreasonably restrains trade.\n\nThe law attempts to prevent the artificial raising of prices by restriction of trade or supply.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://butnowyouknow.net/those-who-fail-to-learn-from-history/sherman-anti-trust-act-and-analysis/|title=Sherman AntiTrust Act, and Analysis|date=12 March 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20111118040849/http://butnowyouknow.net/those-who-fail-to-learn-from-history/sherman-anti-trust-act-and-analysis/|archivedate=18 November 2011}}</ref> \"Innocent monopoly\", or [[monopoly]] achieved solely by merit, is perfectly legal, but acts by a monopolist to artificially preserve that status, or nefarious dealings to create a monopoly, are not. The purpose of the Sherman Act is not to protect competitors from harm from legitimately successful businesses, nor to prevent businesses from gaining honest profits from consumers, but rather to preserve a competitive marketplace to protect consumers from abuses.<ref name=\"Cseres2005\">\"This focus of U.S. competition law, on protection of competition rather than competitors, is not necessarily the only possible focus or purpose of competition law.

Senator [[George Hoar]] of [[Massachusetts]], another author of the Sherman Act, said the following:\n\n{{cquote|...

Legislative and judicial action of both a criminal and civil nature already restrained concerted action by labor.

The denial by employers of the right of employees to organize and the refusal by employers to accept the procedure of collective bargaining lead to strikes and other forms of industrial strife or unrest, which have the intent or the necessary effect of burdening or obstructing commerce. . . .\"\n\nThe Anti-Racketeering Act, 48 Stat. 979, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 420a-420e (1934), is designed to protect trade and commerce against interference by violence and threats. \u00a7 420a provides that\n\n\"any person who, in connection with or in relation to any act in any way or in any degree affecting trade or commerce or any article or commodity moving or about to move in trade or commerce --\"\n\n\"(a) Obtains or attempts to obtain, by the use of or attempt to use or threat to use force, violence, or coercion, the payment of money or other valuable considerations . . . not including, however, the payment of wages by a bonafide employer to a bona fide employee; or\"\n\n\"(b) Obtains the property of another, with his consent, induced by wrongful use of force or fear, or under color of official right; or\"\n\n\"(c) Commits or threatens to commit an act of physical violence or physical injury to a person or property in furtherance of a plan or purpose to violate subsections (a) or (b); or\"\n\n\"(d) Conspires or acts concertedly with any other person or persons to commit any of the foregoing acts; shall, upon conviction thereof, be guilty of a felony and shall be punished by imprisonment from one to ten years or by a fine of $10,000 or both.\"\n\nBut the application of the provisions of \u00a7 420a to labor unions is restricted by \u00a7 420d, which provides:\n\n\"Jurisdiction of offenses. Any person charged with violating section 420a of this title may be prosecuted in any district in which any part of the offense has been committed by him or by his actual associates participating with him in the offense or by his fellow conspirators: ''Provided,'' That no court of the United States shall construe or apply any of the provisions of sections 420a to 420e of this title in such manner as to impair, diminish, or in any manner affect the rights of bona fide labor organizations in lawfully carrying out the legitimate objects thereof, as such rights are expressed in existing statutes of the United States.\"\n\nIt is significant that Chapter 9 of the Criminal Code, dealing with \"Offenses Against Foreign And Interstate Commerce\" and relating specifically to acts of interstate transportation or its obstruction, makes no mention of the Sherman Act, which is made a part of the Code which deals with social, economic and commercial results of interstate activity, notwithstanding its criminal penalty.\"\n\n</ref> The law was enacted in the era of \"trusts\" and of \"combinations\" of businesses and of capital organized and directed to control of the market by suppression of competition in the marketing of goods and services, the monopolistic tendency of which had become a matter of public concern. The goal was to prevent restraints of free competition in business and commercial transactions which tended to restrict production, raise prices, or otherwise control the market to the detriment of purchasers or consumers of goods and services, all of which had come to be regarded as a special form of public injury.<ref>Footnote 15 appears here:\n\n\"The history of the Sherman Act, as contained in the legislative proceedings, is emphatic in its support for the conclusion that \"business competition\" was the problem considered, and that the act was designed to prevent restraints of trade which had a significant effect on such competition.\n\nOn July 10, 1888, the Senate adopted without discussion a resolution offered by Senator Sherman which directed the Committee on Finance to inquire into, and report in connection with, revenue bills\n\n\"such measures as it may deem expedient to set aside, control, restrain or prohibit all arrangements, contracts, agreements, trusts, or combinations between persons or corporations, made with a view, or which tend to prevent ''free and full competition'' . . . with such penalties and provisions . . . as will tend to preserve freedom of trade and production, the natural competition of increasing production, the lowering of prices by such competition . . .\"\n\n(19 Cong.Rec. 6041).\n\nThis resolution explicitly presented the economic theory of the proponents of such legislation. The various bills introduced between 1888 and 1890 follow the theory of this resolution. Many bills sought to make void all arrangements\n\n\"made with a view, or which tend, to prevent full and free competition in the production, manufacture, or sale of articles of domestic growth or production, . . .\"\n\nS. 3445; S. 3510; H.R. 11339; all of the 50th Cong., 1st Sess. (1888) were bills of this type. In the 51st Cong. (1889), the bills were in a similar vein. ''See'' S. 1, sec. 1 (this bill as redrafted by the Judiciary Committee ultimately became the Sherman Law); H.R. 202, sec. 3; H.R. 270; H.R. 286; H.R. 402; H.R. 509; H.R. 826; H.R. 3819. ''See'' Bills and Debates in Congress relating to Trusts (1909), Vol. 1, pp. 1025\u20131031.\n\nOnly one, which was never enacted, S. 1268 in the 52d Cong., 1st Sess. (1892), introduced by Senator Peffer, sought to prohibit\n\n\"every willful act . . . which shall have the effect to in any way interfere with the freedom of transit of articles in interstate commerce, . . .\"\n\nWhen the antitrust bill (S. 1, 51st Cong., 1st Sess.) came before Congress for debate, the debates point to a similar purpose. Senator Sherman asserted the bill prevented only \"business combinations\" \"made with a view to prevent competition\", 21 Cong.Rec. 2457, 2562; ''see also ibid.'' at 2459, 2461.\n\nSenator Allison spoke of combinations which \"control prices,\" ''ibid.,'' 2471; Senator Pugh of combinations \"to limit production\" for \"the purpose of destroying competition\", ''ibid.,'' 2558; Senator Morgan of combinations \"that affect the price of commodities,\" ''ibid.,'' 2609; Senator Platt, a critic of the bill, said this bill proceeds on the assumption that \"competition is beneficent to the country,\" ''ibid.,'' 2729; Senator George denounced trusts which crush out competition, \"and that is the great evil at which all this legislation ought to be directed,\" ''ibid.,'' 3147.\n\nIn the House, Representative Culberson, who was in charge of the bill, interpreted the bill to prohibit various arrangements which tend to drive out competition, ''ibid.,'' 4089; Representative Wilson spoke in favor of the bill against combinations among\n\n\"competing producers to control the supply of their product, in order that they may dictate the terms on which they shall sell in the market, and may secure release from the stress of competition among themselves,\"\n\n''ibid.,'' 4090.\n\nThe unanimity with which foes and supporters of the bill spoke of its aims as the protection of free competition permits use of the debates in interpreting the purpose of the act.

Section 1 delineates and prohibits specific means of anticompetitive conduct, while Section 2 deals with end results that are anti-competitive in nature. Thus, these sections supplement each other in an effort to prevent businesses from violating the spirit of the Act, while technically remaining within the letter of the law. Section 3 simply extends the provisions of Section 1 to U.S. territories and the District of Columbia.\n\n{{quote|Section 1:\n:Every contract, combination in the form of [[Trust (19th century)|trust]] or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal.<ref>See {{usc|15|1}}.</ref>\nSection 2:\n:Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a felony [. . . ]<ref>See {{usc|15|2}}.</ref>}}\n\n====Subsequent legislation expanding its scope====\nThe [[Clayton Antitrust Act]], passed in 1914, proscribes certain additional activities that had been discovered to fall outside the scope of the Sherman Antitrust Act. For example, the Clayton Act added certain practices to the list of impermissible activities:\n* price discrimination between different purchasers, if such discrimination tends to create a monopoly\n* exclusive dealing agreements\n* tying arrangements\n* mergers and acquisitions that substantially reduce market competition.\n\nThe [[Robinson\u2013Patman Act]] of 1936 amended the Clayton Act.

Dental Ass'n'', 526 U.S. at 770.</ref> Taking a \"quick look,\" economic harm is presumed from the questionable nature of the conduct, and the burden is shifted to the defendant to prove harmlessness or justification. The quick-look became a popular way of disposing of cases where the conduct was in a grey area between illegality \"per se\" and demonstrable harmfulness under the \"rule of reason\".\n\n===Modern trends===\n\n====Inference of conspiracy====\nA modern trend has increased difficulty for antitrust plaintiffs as courts have come to hold plaintiffs to increasing burdens of pleading. Under older Section 1 precedent, it was not settled how much evidence was required to show a conspiracy. For example, a conspiracy could be inferred based on parallel conduct, etc. That is, plaintiffs were only required to show that a conspiracy was conceivable. Since the 1970s, however, courts have held plaintiffs to higher standards, giving antitrust defendants an opportunity to resolve cases in their favor before significant discovery under [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure|FRCP]] 12(b)(6). That is, to overcome a [[Motion in United States law|motion to dismiss]], plaintiffs, under ''[[Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly]]'', must plead facts consistent with [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure|FRCP]] 8(a) sufficient to show that a conspiracy is plausible (and not merely conceivable or possible). This protects defendants from bearing the costs of antitrust \"fishing expeditions\"; however it deprives plaintiffs of perhaps their only tool to acquire evidence (discovery).\n\n=====Manipulation of market=====\nSecond, courts have employed more sophisticated and principled definitions of markets. Market definition is necessary, in rule of reason cases, for the plaintiff to prove a conspiracy is harmful. It is also necessary for the plaintiff to establish the market relationship between conspirators to prove their conduct is within the per se rule.\n\nIn early cases, it was easier for plaintiffs to show market relationship, or dominance, by tailoring market definition, even if it ignored fundamental principles of economics. In ''[[U.S. v. Grinnell]]'', 384 U.S. 563 (1966), the trial judge, [[Charles Wyzanski]], composed the market only of alarm companies with services in every state, tailoring out any local competitors; the defendant stood alone in this market, but had the court added up the entire national market, it would have had a much smaller share of the national market for alarm services that the court purportedly used. The appellate courts affirmed this finding; however, today, an appellate court would likely find this definition to be flawed. Modern courts use a more sophisticated market definition that does not permit as manipulative a definition.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\n===Monopoly===\nSection 2 of the Act forbade monopoly. In Section 2 cases, the court has, again on its own initiative, drawn a distinction between [[Coercive monopoly|coercive]] and innocent monopoly. The act is not meant to punish businesses that come to dominate their market passively or on their own merit, only those that intentionally dominate the market through misconduct, which generally consists of conspiratorial conduct of the kind forbidden by Section 1 of the Sherman Act, or Section 3 of the Clayton Act.\n\n===Application of the act outside pure commerce===\nThe Act was aimed at regulating businesses. However, its application was not limited to the commercial side of business. Its prohibition of the cartel was also interpreted to make illegal many labor union activities. This is because unions were characterized as cartels as well (cartels of laborers).<ref>See {{ussc|name=Loewe v. Lawlor|link=|volume=208|page=274|pin=|year=1908}}.</ref> This persisted until 1914, when the [[Clayton Antitrust Act|Clayton Act]] created exceptions for certain union activities.\n\n==Preemption by Section 1 of state statutes that restrain competition==\n{{Main|Sherman Antitrust Act (federal preemption)}}\nTo determine whether a particular state statute that restrains competition was intended to be preempted by the Act, courts will engage in a two-step analysis, as set forth by the Supreme Court in ''[[Rice v. Norman Williams Co.]]'':\n* First, they will inquire whether the state legislation \"mandates or authorizes conduct that necessarily constitutes a violation of the antitrust laws in all cases, or ... places irresistible pressure on a private party to violate the antitrust laws in order to comply with the statute.\" ''[[Rice v. Norman Williams Co.]]'', 458 U.S. 654, 661; see also ''[[324 Liquor Corp. v. Duffy]]'', 479 U.S. 335 (1987) (\"Our decisions reflect the principle that the federal antitrust laws pre-empt state laws authorizing or compelling private parties to engage in anticompetitive behavior.\")\n* Second, they will consider whether the state statute is saved from preemption by the [[state action immunity doctrine]] (aka ''Parker'' immunity). In ''[[California Retail Liquor Dealers Association v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc.]]'', 445 U.S. 97, 105 (1980), the Supreme Court established a two-part test for applying the doctrine: \"First, the challenged restraint must be one clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed as state policy; second, the policy must be actively supervised by the State itself.\" Id. (citation and quotation marks omitted).\n\n== Criticism ==\n{{See also|United States antitrust law|Competition law}}\n[[Alan Greenspan]], in his essay entitled ''Antitrust''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.polyconomics.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1605:antitrust-by-alan-greenspan&catid=47:1998 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-19 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140510124441/http://www.polyconomics.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1605:antitrust-by-alan-greenspan&catid=47:1998 |archivedate=2014-05-10 }}</ref> described the Sherman Act as stifling innovation and harming society. \"No one will ever know what new products, processes, machines, and cost-saving mergers failed to come into existence, killed by the Sherman Act before they were born. No one can ever compute the price that all of us have paid for that Act which, by inducing less effective use of capital, has kept our standard of living lower than would otherwise have been possible.\" Greenspan summarized the nature of antitrust law as: \"a jumble of economic irrationality and ignorance.\"<ref>Criticisms such as this one, attributed to Greenspan, are not directed at the Sherman act in particular, but rather at the underlying policy of all antitrust law, which includes several pieces of legislation other than just the Sherman Act, e.g. the [[Clayton Antitrust Act]].</ref>\n\nGreenspan at that time was a disciple and friend of [[Ayn Rand]], and he first published ''Antitrust'' in Rand's monthly publication ''The Objectivist Newsletter.'' Rand, who described herself as \"a radical for capitalism,\"<ref>''Check Your Premises,'' The Objectivist Newsletter, January 1962, vol. 1, no. 1, p. 1</ref> opposed antitrust law not only on economic grounds but also morally, as a violation of property rights, asserting that the \"meaning and purpose\" of antitrust law is \"the penalizing of ability for being ability, the penalizing of success for being success, and the sacrifice of productive genius to the demands of envious mediocrity.\"<ref>''Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal,'' Ch. 3, New American Library, Signet, 1967</ref>\n\nIn 1890, [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[William E. Mason|William Mason]] said \"trusts have made products cheaper, have reduced prices; but if the price of oil, for instance, were reduced to one cent a barrel, it would not right the wrong done to people of this country by the trusts which have destroyed legitimate competition and driven honest men from legitimate business enterprise.\"<ref>Congressional Record, 51st Congress, 1st session, House, June 20, 1890, p. 4100.</ref> Consequently, if the primary goal of the act is to protect consumers, and consumers are protected by lower prices, the act may be harmful if it reduces [[economy of scale]], a price-lowering mechanism, by breaking up big businesses. Mason put small business survival, a justice interest, on a level concomitant with the pure economic rationale of consumer \n\nEconomist [[Thomas DiLorenzo]] notes that Senator Sherman sponsored the 1890 [[William McKinley]] tariff just three months after the Sherman Act, and agrees with ''[[The New York Times]]'' which wrote on October 1, 1890: \"That so-called Anti-Trust law was passed to deceive the people and to clear the way for the enactment of this Pro-Trust law relating to the tariff.\" The ''Times'' went on to assert that Sherman merely supported this \"humbug\" of a law \"in order that party organs might say...'Behold! We have attacked the trusts. The Republican Party is the enemy of all such rings.'\" <ref name=NYT>{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1890/10/01/103268337.pdf|title=Mr. Sherman's Hopes and Fears|date=1890-10-01|accessdate=2008-04-21|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>\n\nDilorenzo writes: \"Protectionists did not want prices paid by consumers to fall. But they also understood that to gain political support for high tariffs they would have to assure the public that industries would not combine to increase prices to politically prohibitive levels. Support for both an antitrust law and tariff hikes would maintain high prices while avoiding the more obvious bilking of consumers.\"<ref>DiLorenzo, Thomas, ''Cato Handbook for Congress'', Antitrust.</ref>\n\n[[Robert Bork]] was well known for his outspoken criticism of the antitrust regime. Another conservative legal scholar and judge, [[Richard Posner]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|Seventh Circuit]], does not condemn the entire regime, but expresses concern with the potential that it could be applied to create inefficiency, rather than to avoid inefficiency.<ref name=posner>Richard Posner, ''Economic Analysis of Law'', p. 295 et seq. (explaining the optimal antitrust regime from an economic point of view)</ref> Posner further believes, along with a number of others, including Bork, that genuinely inefficient cartels and coercive monopolies, the target of the act, would be self-corrected by market forces, making the strict penalties of antitrust legislation unnecessary.<ref name=posner />\n\nConversely, liberal [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] Justice [[William O. Douglas]] criticized the judiciary for interpreting and enforcing the antitrust law unequally: \"From the beginning it [the Sherman Act] has been applied by judges hostile to its purposes, friendly to the empire builders who wanted it emasculated... trusts that were dissolved reintegrated in new forms... It is ironic that the Sherman Act was truly effective in only one respect, and that was when it was applied to labor unions.  Then the courts read it with a literalness that never appeared in their other decisions.\"<ref>Douglas, William O., An Almanac of Liberty, Doubleday & Company, 1954, p. 189</ref>\n\nAccording to a 2018 study in the journal ''Public Choice'', \"Senator John Sherman of Ohio was motivated to introduce an antitrust bill in late 1889 partly as a way of enacting revenge on his political rival, General and former Governor Russell Alger of Michigan, because Sherman believed that Alger personally had cost him the presidential nomination at the 1888 Republican national convention... Sherman was able to pursue his revenge motive by combining it with the broader Republican goals of preserving high tariffs and attacking the trusts.\"<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Newman |first=Patrick |date=2018-01-12 |title=Revenge: John Sherman, Russell Alger and the origins of the Sherman Act |journal=Public Choice |volume=174 |issue=3\u20134 |language=en |pages=257\u2013275 |doi=10.1007/s11127-017-0497-x |issn=0048-5829}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Alcoa]]\n* [[American Bar Association]]\n* [[American Tobacco Company]]\n* [[Antitrust]]\n* [[Bell System divestiture]]\n* [[Cartel]]\n* [[Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914]]\n* [[DRAM price fixing]]\n* [[George Howard Earle, Jr.|George H.

The story follows a 12-year-old boy named Miguel who is accidentally transported to the Land of the Dead, where he seeks the help of his deceased musician great-great-grandfather to return him to his family among the living and to reverse his family's ban on music.\n\nThe concept for ''Coco'' is inspired by the Mexican holiday [[Day of the Dead]]. The film was scripted by Molina and Matthew Aldrich from a story by Unkrich, Jason Katz, Aldrich and Molina. Pixar began developing the animation in 2016; Unkrich and some of the film's crew visited Mexico for research. Composer [[Michael Giacchino]], who had worked on prior Pixar animated features, composed the score. ''Coco'' is the first film with a nine-figure budget to feature an all-Latino principal cast, with a cost of $175{{nbsp}}million.\n\n''Coco'' premiered on October 20, 2017, during the [[Morelia International Film Festival]] in [[Morelia, Mexico]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://moreliafilmfest.com/en/coco-la-nueva-pelicula-de-disney%E2%80%A2pixar-abrira-el-15o-ficm/|title=''Coco'', the new Disney\u2022Pixar movie, will open the 15th FICM|date=July 21, 2017|publisher=Festival Internacional del Cine en Morelia|accessdate=November 6, 2017}}</ref> It was theatrically released in Mexico the following week, the weekend before {{lang|es|D\u00eda de los Muertos}}, and in the United States on November 22, 2017.

His great-great-grandmother Imelda was married to a man who left her and their daughter Coco to pursue a career in music, and when he never returned, Imelda banished music from her family's life before starting a shoemaking business. Miguel now lives with the elderly Coco and their family, including Miguel's parents and grandmother, who are all shoemakers. He idolizes famous deceased musician Ernesto de la Cruz. Miguel made a makeshift guitar and he secretly teaches himself to play it from Ernesto's old films. On the Day of the Dead, Miguel accidentally damages the picture frame that holds a photo of Coco with her mother on the family {{lang|es|[[ofrenda]]}}, discovering that a hidden section of the photograph shows his great-great-grandfather holding Ernesto's famous guitar. Though the image's face has been torn off, Miguel concludes that Ernesto is his great-great-grandfather. Ignoring his family's objections, he decides to enter a Day of the Dead talent show.\n\nBreaking into Ernesto's mausoleum, Miguel takes his guitar to use in the show, but once he strums it, he becomes invisible to everyone in the village plaza. However, he can interact with his [[calaca|skeletal]] dead relatives, who are visiting from the Land of the Dead for the holiday. Taking him back with them, they learn that Imelda cannot visit, since Miguel accidentally removed her photo from the {{lang|es|ofrenda}}. Miguel discovers that he is cursed for stealing from the dead, and must return to the Land of the Living before sunrise, or he will become one of the dead; to do so, he must receive a blessing from a member of his family. Imelda offers Miguel a blessing on the condition he end his dream of becoming a musician, but Miguel refuses and resolves to seek Ernesto's blessing instead. He meets H\u00e9ctor, who declares that he knows Ernesto, offering to help him reach him in return for Miguel taking his photo back with him, so that he might visit his daughter before she forgets him, causing him to disappear completely. H\u00e9ctor helps Miguel enter a talent competition to win entry to Ernesto's mansion, but Miguel's family tracks him down, forcing him to flee. Miguel sneaks into the mansion, where Ernesto welcomes him as his descendant, but H\u00e9ctor confronts them, again imploring Miguel to take his photo to the Land of the Living. Ernesto and H\u00e9ctor renew an argument from their partnership in life, and Miguel realizes that when H\u00e9ctor decided to leave the duo to return to his family, Ernesto poisoned him and stole his guitar and songs, passing them off as his own to become famous. To protect his legacy, Ernesto seizes the photo and has his security guards throw Miguel and H\u00e9ctor into a [[cenote]] pit. There, Miguel realizes that H\u00e9ctor is his real great-great-grandfather, and that Coco is H\u00e9ctor's daughter. \n\nAfter Imelda and the family rescue the duo, Miguel reveals the truth about H\u00e9ctor's death. Imelda and H\u00e9ctor reconcile, and the family infiltrates Ernesto's concert to retrieve H\u00e9ctor's photo. Ernesto's crimes are exposed to the audience, who jeer at him as he is thrown out of the stadium, then crushed by a giant bell (the same way he died); in the chaos, however, H\u00e9ctor's photograph is lost. As the sun rises, Coco's life and memory are fading; Imelda and H\u00e9ctor bless Miguel, so that he can return to the Land of the Living. After Miguel plays \"[[Remember Me (Pixar song)|Remember Me]]\" (a song that H\u00e9ctor wrote for Coco, that Ernesto uses as his number one hit), Coco brightens and sings along with Miguel. She reveals that she had saved the torn-off piece of the family photo with H\u00e9ctor's face on it, then tells her family stories about her father, thus saving his memory as well as his existence in the Land of the Dead. Miguel's family reconciles with him, ending the ban on music; one year later, Miguel presents the family {{lang|es|ofrenda}} (which now includes the deceased Coco) to his new baby sister. Coco's collected letters from H\u00e9ctor prove that Ernesto stole his songs, destroying Ernesto's legacy and allowing H\u00e9ctor to be rightfully honored in his place. In the Land of the Dead, H\u00e9ctor and Imelda rekindle their romance and join Coco for a visit to the living, where Miguel plays and sings for his living and dead relatives.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=}}\n* [[Anthony Gonzalez (actor)|Anthony Gonzalez]] as Miguel, a 12-year-old aspiring musician.<ref name=VFMexicoAgeTrump /><ref name=\"AMCharacterFamily\">{{cite news|last1=Milligan|first1=Mercedes|title=Disney-Pixar Introduces the 'Coco' Character Family|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/features/disney-pixar-introduces-the-coco-character-family/|language=English|accessdate= June 8, 2017|work=Animation Magazine|date=June 6, 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal]] as H\u00e9ctor, a charming [[trickster]] in the Land of the Dead who enlists Miguel to help him visit the Land of the Living.

In one version of the story, his family is cursed with singing when trying to speak, which was included as a technique to add music to a story where music is banned. Originally, Lopez and Anderson-Lopez had written many more songs for the film than what ended up in the released version; one piece that survived in storyboard until late into the production was an expository song that explained the Mexican holiday to viewers to begin the film. In another song, Miguel's mother explains the tradition of shoe-making in their family, and how this means he is not allowed to pursue music.<ref>{{Citation|title=Coco: Deleted Scenes with commentary|date=2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qurIuw_LCgc|volume=|pages=|publisher=Pixar Animation Studios|access-date=2018-06-22}}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\n''Coco'' is the first-ever motion picture with a nine-figure budget to feature an all-Latino cast, with a cost of $175\u2013200{{nbsp}}million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhregister.com/news/article/Pixar-s-Coco-feasts-on-Justice-12384697.php|title=Pixar's 'Coco' feasts on 'Justice League' at box office|date=November 26, 2017|publisher=[[New Haven Register]]|accessdate=November 27, 2017}}</ref> Gonzalez first auditioned for the role of Miguel when he was nine, and was finalized in the role two years later.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2017/11/24/meet-anthony-gonzalez-teen-breakout-star-pixars-animated-coco/885828001/|title=Meet Anthony Gonzalez, the teen breakout star of Pixar's animated 'Coco'|website=Usatoday.com}}</ref> Speaking of his character, Gonzalez said: \"[Miguel and I] both know the importance of following our dream and we know the importance of following our tradition, so that's something that I connected with Miguel a lot\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/redeye/culture/ct-redeye-coco-movie-actor-anthony-gonzalez-interview-20180223-story.html|title='Coco' star Anthony Gonzalez connects his passion for music with his love for family|first=Sad\u00e9|last=Carpenter|website=Chicagotribune.com}}</ref> During the film's pre-production, Miguel was originally set to be voiced by a child named Emilio Fuentes, but was removed from the role after his voice deepened due to puberty over the course of the film's production.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/coco-how-pixar-brought-day-dead-story-life-1065932|title='Coco': How Pixar Brought Its \"Day of the Dead\" Story to Life|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, the ''Coco'' team made an official announcement about the cast, which revealed that Gael Garcia Bernal, Benjamin Bratt, Ren\u00e9e Victor, and Anthony Gonzalez would voice the characters.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/12/pixar-coco-gael-garcia-bernal-dia-de-los-muertos-miguel|title=Pixar's Coco Is a \"Love Letter to Mexico\" When It's Needed Most|first=Joanna|last=Robinson|website=Vanityfair.com}}</ref> Bratt, who voiced De la Cruz, was \"moved\" when he realized that Disney-Pixar wanted to make a film on Latin culture.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/gael-garc-a-bernal-talks-singing-pixars-coco-1056611|title=Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal Talks About Singing in Pixar's 'Coco'|website=Hollywoodreporter.com|accessdate=May 26, 2018}}</ref> Disney officials closely monitored Bernal's movements and expressions while he voiced the characters and used their input for animating H\u00e9ctor.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/coco-interview-gael-garcia-bernal/|title=Coco Was A 'Collaborative Process' At Pixar|date=November 21, 2017|website=Screenrant.com|accessdate=May 26, 2018}}</ref>\n\nBratt voiced Ernesto De la Cruz, a character who he described as \"the Mexican Frank Sinatra\"; \"[a] larger than life persona\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/coco-interview-benjamin-bratt-anthony-gonzalez/|title=Benjamin Bratt Is Mexican Sinatra In Coco|date=November 21, 2017|publisher=}}</ref> On the advice of the filmmakers, Bratt watched videos of equivalent Mexican actors including [[Jorge Negrete]] and [[Pedro Infante]].

Color was one: \"Given the holiday and the iconography, [Pixar] knew the Land of the Dead had to be a visually vibrant and colorful place, so [they] deliberately designed Santa Cecilia to be more muted\" said Unkrich.<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n\nAccording to Harley Jessup, the film's production designer, Santa Cecilia is based on real Mexican villages, as the production team \"stayed grounded in reality in the Land of the Living\". Chris Bernardi, the film's set supervisor, said that the town was made small so Miguel could feel confined. Bert Berry, the film's art director, said that aged building materials were used in order to depict Santa Cecilia \"as an older charming city\".<ref name=\"PressKit\"/> According to Unkrich, Miguel's guitar playing is authentic, as they \"videotaped musicians playing each song or melody and strapped GoPros on their guitars\" to use as a reference. For the scene in which Miguel plays music in his secret hideout, the filmmakers used \"very elegant, lyrical camera moves\" and \"gentle drifts and slow arcing moves around Miguel as he plays his guitar with very shallow depth of \ufb01eld to enhance the beauty of the soft-focus foreground candles\".<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n\nChristian Hoffman, the film's character supervisor, said that all of the details in Mama Coco's face were not modeled. Instead, his team used special software to design separate layers of detail, which were then added to her face with a shader. The character's model was made with higher resolution to get all the wrinkles right, according to Hoffman.<ref name=\"PressKit\"/> Pixar used some Xolo dogs to use as reference for the character Dante, while a tentacle from ''[[Finding Dory]]'''s Hank was used for his tongue.\n\nJessup called the Marigold petal bridge that connects both worlds \"elegant and magical\". Michael K. O'Brien, the film's effects supervisor, called it \"a huge technical challenge\" for the animation team, but referred to it as something \"so visually exciting with petals dripping from it; it was a massive artistic undertaking. [the production team] wanted it to glow \u2014 to feel alive\". The scenes in which Miguel takes a few petals off of the bridge and in which Hector sinks into the bridge were given more effects and special art direction.<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n\nFor the Land of the Dead, Unkrich did not want \"to have just a free-for-all, wacky world\", wanting instead to add logic and be \"ever-expanding because  new residents would arrive regularly\". Jessup said that the animation team wanted the Land of the Dead \"to be a vibrant explosion of color\" when Miguel arrives. Jessup also said that \"Lee [Unkrich] described a vertical world of towers, contrasting with the flatness of Santa Cecilia. The lights and reflections are dazzling and there's a crazy transportation system that connects it all. The costume colors are much more vibrant than in the Land of the Living, where [the animation team] tried to stay grounded in reality. [They] really went all out in the Land of the Dead to make it a reflection of the holiday\". According to David Ryu, the film's supervising technical director, the animation team \"\ufb01gured out a way to introduce a single light \u2014 but give it a million points\" for the scenes on the outside in the Land of the Dead: \"The renderer sees it as one light, but we see a million lights\".<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n\nAccording to art director Daniel Arraiga, the animators \"had to \ufb01gure out how to give [the skeletons] personality without skin, muscles, noses or even lips\" and that they \"played with shapes and did a lot of paintings. [They] sculpted and studied skulls from every angle to \ufb01gure out where [they] could add appeal and charm\". Global technology supervisor J.D. Northrup was hired early in the film's production in order to avoid potential issues in the film's animation process. Northrup said that \"Each [of the skeletons' pieces] had to be independent so the complexity of the rig and the stress that it puts on the pipeline were something like we've never seen before.\" Northrup was also tasked with simplifying the skeleton's elements to render the skeleton crowds. In order to create the skeletons, several additional controls were used, as they \"needed to move in ways that humans don't,\" according to character modeling and articulation lead Michael Honse. Honse said that the bones were a particular problem, stating that \"there was a lot of back-and-forth with animation to get it right,\" but found \"really cool ways\" to move the skeletons.<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n\n===Music and soundtrack===\n{{Infobox album\n| name         = Coco (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)\n| type         = Soundtrack\n| artist       = Various Artists\n| cover        = \n| alt          = \n| released     = {{Start date|2017|11|10}}\n| recorded     = August\u2013October 2017\n| venue        = \n| studio       = {{flat list|*[[Warner Bros.

Composer [[Michael Giacchino]], who had worked on prior Pixar animated features, composed the score. ''Coco'' is the first film with a nine-figure budget to feature an all-Latino principal cast, with a cost of $175{{nbsp}}million.\n\n''Coco'' premiered on October 20, 2017, during the [[Morelia International Film Festival]] in [[Morelia, Mexico]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://moreliafilmfest.com/en/coco-la-nueva-pelicula-de-disney%E2%80%A2pixar-abrira-el-15o-ficm/|title=''Coco'', the new Disney\u2022Pixar movie, will open the 15th FICM|date=July 21, 2017|publisher=Festival Internacional del Cine en Morelia|accessdate=November 6, 2017}}</ref> It was theatrically released in Mexico the following week, the weekend before {{lang|es|D\u00eda de los Muertos}}, and in the United States on November 22, 2017.

As of this note, there are 696 words. Also, keep the summary short please.-->\nIn Santa Cecilia, [[Mexico]], Miguel dreams of becoming a musician, even though his family strictly forbids it. His great-great-grandmother Imelda was married to a man who left her and their daughter Coco to pursue a career in music, and when he never returned, Imelda banished music from her family's life before starting a shoemaking business. Miguel now lives with the elderly Coco and their family, including Miguel's parents and grandmother, who are all shoemakers. He idolizes famous deceased musician Ernesto de la Cruz. Miguel made a makeshift guitar and he secretly teaches himself to play it from Ernesto's old films. On the Day of the Dead, Miguel accidentally damages the picture frame that holds a photo of Coco with her mother on the family {{lang|es|[[ofrenda]]}}, discovering that a hidden section of the photograph shows his great-great-grandfather holding Ernesto's famous guitar. Though the image's face has been torn off, Miguel concludes that Ernesto is his great-great-grandfather. Ignoring his family's objections, he decides to enter a Day of the Dead talent show.\n\nBreaking into Ernesto's mausoleum, Miguel takes his guitar to use in the show, but once he strums it, he becomes invisible to everyone in the village plaza. However, he can interact with his [[calaca|skeletal]] dead relatives, who are visiting from the Land of the Dead for the holiday. Taking him back with them, they learn that Imelda cannot visit, since Miguel accidentally removed her photo from the {{lang|es|ofrenda}}. Miguel discovers that he is cursed for stealing from the dead, and must return to the Land of the Living before sunrise, or he will become one of the dead; to do so, he must receive a blessing from a member of his family. Imelda offers Miguel a blessing on the condition he end his dream of becoming a musician, but Miguel refuses and resolves to seek Ernesto's blessing instead. He meets H\u00e9ctor, who declares that he knows Ernesto, offering to help him reach him in return for Miguel taking his photo back with him, so that he might visit his daughter before she forgets him, causing him to disappear completely. H\u00e9ctor helps Miguel enter a talent competition to win entry to Ernesto's mansion, but Miguel's family tracks him down, forcing him to flee. Miguel sneaks into the mansion, where Ernesto welcomes him as his descendant, but H\u00e9ctor confronts them, again imploring Miguel to take his photo to the Land of the Living. Ernesto and H\u00e9ctor renew an argument from their partnership in life, and Miguel realizes that when H\u00e9ctor decided to leave the duo to return to his family, Ernesto poisoned him and stole his guitar and songs, passing them off as his own to become famous. To protect his legacy, Ernesto seizes the photo and has his security guards throw Miguel and H\u00e9ctor into a [[cenote]] pit. There, Miguel realizes that H\u00e9ctor is his real great-great-grandfather, and that Coco is H\u00e9ctor's daughter. \n\nAfter Imelda and the family rescue the duo, Miguel reveals the truth about H\u00e9ctor's death. Imelda and H\u00e9ctor reconcile, and the family infiltrates Ernesto's concert to retrieve H\u00e9ctor's photo. Ernesto's crimes are exposed to the audience, who jeer at him as he is thrown out of the stadium, then crushed by a giant bell (the same way he died); in the chaos, however, H\u00e9ctor's photograph is lost. As the sun rises, Coco's life and memory are fading; Imelda and H\u00e9ctor bless Miguel, so that he can return to the Land of the Living. After Miguel plays \"[[Remember Me (Pixar song)|Remember Me]]\" (a song that H\u00e9ctor wrote for Coco, that Ernesto uses as his number one hit), Coco brightens and sings along with Miguel. She reveals that she had saved the torn-off piece of the family photo with H\u00e9ctor's face on it, then tells her family stories about her father, thus saving his memory as well as his existence in the Land of the Dead. Miguel's family reconciles with him, ending the ban on music; one year later, Miguel presents the family {{lang|es|ofrenda}} (which now includes the deceased Coco) to his new baby sister. Coco's collected letters from H\u00e9ctor prove that Ernesto stole his songs, destroying Ernesto's legacy and allowing H\u00e9ctor to be rightfully honored in his place. In the Land of the Dead, H\u00e9ctor and Imelda rekindle their romance and join Coco for a visit to the living, where Miguel plays and sings for his living and dead relatives.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=}}\n* [[Anthony Gonzalez (actor)|Anthony Gonzalez]] as Miguel, a 12-year-old aspiring musician.<ref name=VFMexicoAgeTrump /><ref name=\"AMCharacterFamily\">{{cite news|last1=Milligan|first1=Mercedes|title=Disney-Pixar Introduces the 'Coco' Character Family|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/features/disney-pixar-introduces-the-coco-character-family/|language=English|accessdate= June 8, 2017|work=Animation Magazine|date=June 6, 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal]] as H\u00e9ctor, a charming [[trickster]] in the Land of the Dead who enlists Miguel to help him visit the Land of the Living.

Color was one: \"Given the holiday and the iconography, [Pixar] knew the Land of the Dead had to be a visually vibrant and colorful place, so [they] deliberately designed Santa Cecilia to be more muted\" said Unkrich.<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n\nAccording to Harley Jessup, the film's production designer, Santa Cecilia is based on real Mexican villages, as the production team \"stayed grounded in reality in the Land of the Living\". Chris Bernardi, the film's set supervisor, said that the town was made small so Miguel could feel confined. Bert Berry, the film's art director, said that aged building materials were used in order to depict Santa Cecilia \"as an older charming city\".<ref name=\"PressKit\"/> According to Unkrich, Miguel's guitar playing is authentic, as they \"videotaped musicians playing each song or melody and strapped GoPros on their guitars\" to use as a reference. For the scene in which Miguel plays music in his secret hideout, the filmmakers used \"very elegant, lyrical camera moves\" and \"gentle drifts and slow arcing moves around Miguel as he plays his guitar with very shallow depth of \ufb01eld to enhance the beauty of the soft-focus foreground candles\".<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n\nChristian Hoffman, the film's character supervisor, said that all of the details in Mama Coco's face were not modeled. Instead, his team used special software to design separate layers of detail, which were then added to her face with a shader. The character's model was made with higher resolution to get all the wrinkles right, according to Hoffman.<ref name=\"PressKit\"/> Pixar used some Xolo dogs to use as reference for the character Dante, while a tentacle from ''[[Finding Dory]]'''s Hank was used for his tongue.\n\nJessup called the Marigold petal bridge that connects both worlds \"elegant and magical\". Michael K. O'Brien, the film's effects supervisor, called it \"a huge technical challenge\" for the animation team, but referred to it as something \"so visually exciting with petals dripping from it; it was a massive artistic undertaking. [the production team] wanted it to glow \u2014 to feel alive\". The scenes in which Miguel takes a few petals off of the bridge and in which Hector sinks into the bridge were given more effects and special art direction.<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n\nFor the Land of the Dead, Unkrich did not want \"to have just a free-for-all, wacky world\", wanting instead to add logic and be \"ever-expanding because  new residents would arrive regularly\". Jessup said that the animation team wanted the Land of the Dead \"to be a vibrant explosion of color\" when Miguel arrives. Jessup also said that \"Lee [Unkrich] described a vertical world of towers, contrasting with the flatness of Santa Cecilia. The lights and reflections are dazzling and there's a crazy transportation system that connects it all. The costume colors are much more vibrant than in the Land of the Living, where [the animation team] tried to stay grounded in reality. [They] really went all out in the Land of the Dead to make it a reflection of the holiday\". According to David Ryu, the film's supervising technical director, the animation team \"\ufb01gured out a way to introduce a single light \u2014 but give it a million points\" for the scenes on the outside in the Land of the Dead: \"The renderer sees it as one light, but we see a million lights\".<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n\nAccording to art director Daniel Arraiga, the animators \"had to \ufb01gure out how to give [the skeletons] personality without skin, muscles, noses or even lips\" and that they \"played with shapes and did a lot of paintings. [They] sculpted and studied skulls from every angle to \ufb01gure out where [they] could add appeal and charm\". Global technology supervisor J.D. Northrup was hired early in the film's production in order to avoid potential issues in the film's animation process. Northrup said that \"Each [of the skeletons' pieces] had to be independent so the complexity of the rig and the stress that it puts on the pipeline were something like we've never seen before.\" Northrup was also tasked with simplifying the skeleton's elements to render the skeleton crowds. In order to create the skeletons, several additional controls were used, as they \"needed to move in ways that humans don't,\" according to character modeling and articulation lead Michael Honse. Honse said that the bones were a particular problem, stating that \"there was a lot of back-and-forth with animation to get it right,\" but found \"really cool ways\" to move the skeletons.<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n\n===Music and soundtrack===\n{{Infobox album\n| name         = Coco (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)\n| type         = Soundtrack\n| artist       = Various Artists\n| cover        = \n| alt          = \n| released     = {{Start date|2017|11|10}}\n| recorded     = August\u2013October 2017\n| venue        = \n| studio       = {{flat list|*[[Warner Bros.

As part of the continued preservation of British history the National Trust has a group of volunteers, the Wey Navigation Research Group, researching and publishing information about the Godalming and Wey Navigation.\n\n==Wharf buildings==\nDapdune Wharf comprises a complex of a dozen buildings. Most are concerned with the construction and maintenance of the barges and stores for the various materials needed.  They include a smithy, a barge repair shed at the end of a short cut from the bend in the river, a carpenters shed, formerly the sail loft, and the barge building shed at the north end of the site.  There was also a graving dock with associated capstans for barges needing repairs below the water line. There were separate stores for gunpowder, part of the oldest building on the site, and for carbide, which was delivered from London for fuel for lamps. Two specialist buildings were the steam chest for bending wood to shape for boat ribs, and the tar chest for [[caulking]].<ref name=welcome>{{cite book |title=Welcome to Dapdune Wharf |date=2013 |publisher=National Trust |location=Swindon}}</ref> A cottage on the wharf, renovated in 1894 for the Edwards family, is a Grade II [[listed building]].<ref>{{NHLE |desc=Wharf Cottage Dapdune Wharf |num=1029200 |accessdate=27 October 2018}}</ref>  The other cottage, Dapdune Lea, was built at the same time for William Stevens III's sister, Mary Jane Stevens.  Later their brother, John, added a first floor balcony in order to be able to watch the cricket in comfort. Dapdune Lea is now the National Trust's administrative offices for the navigations.<ref name=welcome />\n\n==Barge Building at Dapdune==\n\nThe Wey Navigation opened in 1653. Traffic on the Navigation grew very quickly. In its first year the owners took \u00a3800 in tolls on goods carried. This quickly grew to \u00a315,000 per annum. One reason for this growth was the many mills that were built along the Wey plus the slow alternative means of transport. One of the largest remaining mills was built at Coxes Lock, near Addlestone.\n\nIn the early days the Navigation was owned by the local landowners and business people. It was [[Richard Weston (canal builder)|Sir Richard Weston]] of [[Sutton Place, Surrey|Sutton Place]], Guildford who first had the idea of making the Wey navigable. By 1723 the Navigation was in the hands of the Langton family and the Earl of Portmore from Weybridge.\n\nTwo families dominated the river and barge building on the Wey, the Stevens and the Edwards.\n\n===Stevens family===\nOver a period of 150 years the Stevens family played an important role in the development of the Wey Navigation. They started from being humble lock keepers to ownership and management of a substantial transport business along the Navigation and around the Guildford area. Four generations of the family were linked to the Navigation.\n\n* William Stevens (1777-1856)\n\nWilliam was a trained carpenter and moved to the Wey in 1812 to take up the position of lock keeper at Trigg's Lock. In 1820 he and his family moved to Thames Lock. Thames Lock, being the entry and exit to the navigation, meant that William had wider duties than the other lock keepers. One of the duties was to calculate the tolls due from the barge owners. This is probably where William got his first taste of the business side of the Navigation.\n\n* William Stevens II (1810-1890)\n\nBorn on the river, William followed his father into the business and it was under him that the family expanded into building and operating their own barges from 1840. William having learnt his trade by working in several yards as an apprentice. The family moved from Thames Lock and lived over the Navigation offices at 3 Friary Street, Guildford. One of their early barges, ''Perseverance'' was built at Guildford in 1840, though not at Dapdune. A number of barges carried the name but it was only the last, ''Perseverance IV'', that was built at Dapdune.\n\n* William Stevens III (1844-1936)\n\nIt was William III who brought the Edwards family to the Navigation and started to build the Wey barges at Dapdune. William also ran several steam tugs and a towage business on the river Thames.  In 1902 the Stevens brothers gained full financial control and ownership of the Navigation.\n\n* Harry W. Stevens (1887-1970)\n\nThe last of the family to be involved with the Navigations, Harry bequeathed the Wey Navigation to the National Trust on his retirement in 1964.<ref>{{cite web |title=A historical background |url=http://www.weyriver.co.uk/theriver/nav_2_%20history.htm |website=River Wey and Navigations. |accessdate=28 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Edwards family===\nIn 1894 William Stevens persuaded Edwin Edwards, a barge builder, to move his family of wife and family (4 sons and several daughters) from the [[Kennet and Avon Canal]] to work at Dapdune. The Stevens provided a cottage for Edwin and his family on site. Prior to coming to Guildford, Edwin Edwards had been working for a well established manufacturing firm at Honey Street, [[Devizes]], supplying wooden barges for customers in the South-West of England.\n\nEdwin died in 1904 at the age of 46 and a further five years were to pass before William Stevens III could launch a newly built barge suitable for trade on the Wey Navigation. In October 1909 he launched his new barge ''Dapdune'' from the barge building shed at Dapdune. The barge had been built by Edwin's four sons in their spare time. The boys\u2019 main job was maintaining the Navigation, especially the locks. ''Dapdune'' remained in service until 1944.\n\nAfter 1909 the Edwards continued to build barges for the Stevens as a part-time occupation and completed eleven barges over the next thirty years. As well as their duties along the Navigation the Edwards brothers also maintained the barges and carried out any necessary repairs.\n\n==Construction of a Wey barge==\n{{main|Barges of the Wey Navigation}}\n[[File:Dapdune Wharf Guildford A Wey river barge.JPG|thumb|Wey barge ''Reliance'']]\nThe Wey barge was built on the earlier western barge designs and the first barges built specifically for use on the Wey were probably built at Honey Street Wharf, Devizes. The earliest that this could be was 1810 as the Kennet and Avon Canal was opened through to the [[River Thames|Thames]] that year.\n\nThe ribs of the hull were built from [[oak]]. There was a steam chest behind the shed (now the public toilet block) where the wood could be shaped. However the Edwards family preferred to find wood naturally shaped.\n\nThe hull was planked with [[Pinus rigida|pitch pine]]. Pitch pine was used because it was lightweight and came in long lengths so required less joints. [[Elm]] was tried, and although it was more water resistant, it was heavier and therefore the barge had a lower cargo capacity.\n\nThe barge was flat bottomed and straight sided, this meant that it could operate in shallow water with a reasonable cargo. Once the hull was complete it was covered in pitch to create a watertight finish. The barge was built on trestles to keep it off the ground and assist in launching.  Only the hull was built in the shed. On completion the water side of the shed was removed and the barge was launched sideways. The barge was then towed up to the area where the pleasure boats are moored today and it was here that fitting out was completed. This was also the area used to repair barges.\n\nThe Wey barge was {{convert|22.5|m|ft}} in length and the width was constrained by the narrowest lock to {{convert|4.3|m|ft}}. A barge would have only centimetres to spare when going through the lock.\n\nA Wey barge could carry 80 tonnes of cargo from the Thames to Coxes mill. From Coxes going upstream the capacity was reduced to 50 tonnes as far as Guildford and further reduced for the journey to Godalming owing to the decrease in the depth of water available.\n\n==Goods carried by the barges==\n\nA variety of goods were transported along the navigation, for example:\n* Wheat grain or barley from Victoria Docks in London to Coxes mill.\n* Gunpowder from Chilworth to Barking or Woolwich\n* Wood pulp from London docks to Woking paper mill\n* Timber from Guildford to London.\n\nWith no engines or sails the barges were towed by horses or people, and occasionally poled or rowed. Once a Wey barge reached the Thames it would be towed by tug boats. The horses were rested in stables along the Navigation. The Navigation owned three stables, at Thames lock, Coxes Mill and Friary Street. The bargemen would pay to use the stables.

As part of the continued preservation of British history the National Trust has a group of volunteers, the Wey Navigation Research Group, researching and publishing information about the Godalming and Wey Navigation.\n\n==Wharf buildings==\nDapdune Wharf comprises a complex of a dozen buildings. Most are concerned with the construction and maintenance of the barges and stores for the various materials needed.  They include a smithy, a barge repair shed at the end of a short cut from the bend in the river, a carpenters shed, formerly the sail loft, and the barge building shed at the north end of the site.  There was also a graving dock with associated capstans for barges needing repairs below the water line. There were separate stores for gunpowder, part of the oldest building on the site, and for carbide, which was delivered from London for fuel for lamps. Two specialist buildings were the steam chest for bending wood to shape for boat ribs, and the tar chest for [[caulking]].<ref name=welcome>{{cite book |title=Welcome to Dapdune Wharf |date=2013 |publisher=National Trust |location=Swindon}}</ref> A cottage on the wharf, renovated in 1894 for the Edwards family, is a Grade II [[listed building]].<ref>{{NHLE |desc=Wharf Cottage Dapdune Wharf |num=1029200 |accessdate=27 October 2018}}</ref>  The other cottage, Dapdune Lea, was built at the same time for William Stevens III's sister, Mary Jane Stevens.  Later their brother, John, added a first floor balcony in order to be able to watch the cricket in comfort. Dapdune Lea is now the National Trust's administrative offices for the navigations.<ref name=welcome />\n\n==Barge Building at Dapdune==\n\nThe Wey Navigation opened in 1653. Traffic on the Navigation grew very quickly. In its first year the owners took \u00a3800 in tolls on goods carried. This quickly grew to \u00a315,000 per annum. One reason for this growth was the many mills that were built along the Wey plus the slow alternative means of transport. One of the largest remaining mills was built at Coxes Lock, near Addlestone.\n\nIn the early days the Navigation was owned by the local landowners and business people. It was [[Richard Weston (canal builder)|Sir Richard Weston]] of [[Sutton Place, Surrey|Sutton Place]], Guildford who first had the idea of making the Wey navigable. By 1723 the Navigation was in the hands of the Langton family and the Earl of Portmore from Weybridge.\n\nTwo families dominated the river and barge building on the Wey, the Stevens and the Edwards.\n\n===Stevens family===\nOver a period of 150 years the Stevens family played an important role in the development of the Wey Navigation. They started from being humble lock keepers to ownership and management of a substantial transport business along the Navigation and around the Guildford area. Four generations of the family were linked to the Navigation.\n\n* William Stevens (1777-1856)\n\nWilliam was a trained carpenter and moved to the Wey in 1812 to take up the position of lock keeper at Trigg\u2019s Lock. In 1820 he and his family moved to Thames Lock. Thames Lock, being the entry and exit to the navigation, meant that William had wider duties than the other lock keepers. One of the duties was to calculate the tolls due from the barge owners. This is probably where William got his first taste of the business side of the Navigation.\n\n* William Stevens II (1810-1890)\n\nBorn on the river, William followed his father into the business and it was under him that the family expanded into building and operating their own barges from 1840. William having learnt his trade by working in several yards as an apprentice. The family moved from Thames Lock and lived over the Navigation offices at 3 Friary Street, Guildford. One of their early barges, ''Perseverance'' was built at Guildford in 1840, though not at Dapdune. A number of barges carried the name but it was only the last, ''Perseverance IV'', that was built at Dapdune.\n\n* William Stevens III (1844-1936)\n\nIt was William III who brought the Edwards family to the Navigation and started to build the Wey barges at Dapdune. William also ran several steam tugs and a towage business on the river Thames.  In 1902 the Stevens brothers gained full financial control and ownership of the Navigation.\n\n* Harry W. Stevens (1887-1970)\n\nThe last of the family to be involved with the Navigations, Harry bequeathed the Wey Navigation to the National Trust on his retirement in 1964.<ref>{{cite web |title=A historical background |url=http://www.weyriver.co.uk/theriver/nav_2_%20history.htm |website=River Wey and Navigations. |accessdate=28 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Edwards family===\nIn 1894 William Stevens persuaded Edwin Edwards, a barge builder, to move his family of wife and family (4 sons and several daughters) from the [[Kennet and Avon Canal]] to work at Dapdune. The Stevens provided a cottage for Edwin and his family on site. Prior to coming to Guildford, Edwin Edwards had been working for a well established manufacturing firm at Honey Street, [[Devizes]], supplying wooden barges for customers in the South-West of England.\n\nEdwin died in 1904 at the age of 46 and a further five years were to pass before William Stevens III could launch a newly built barge suitable for trade on the Wey Navigation. In October 1909 he launched his new barge ''Dapdune'' from the barge building shed at Dapdune. The barge had been built by Edwin\u2019s four sons in their spare time. The boys\u2019 main job was maintaining the Navigation, especially the locks. ''Dapdune'' remained in service until 1944.\n\nAfter 1909 the Edwards continued to build barges for the Stevens as a part time occupation and completed eleven barges over the next thirty years. As well as their duties along the Navigation the Edwards brothers also maintained the barges and carried out any necessary repairs.\n\n==Construction of a Wey barge==\n{{main|Barges of the Wey Navigation}}\n[[File:Dapdune Wharf Guildford A Wey river barge.JPG|thumb|Wey barge ''Reliance'']]\nThe Wey barge was built on the earlier western barge designs and the first barges built specifically for use on the Wey were probably built at Honey Street Wharf, Devizes. The earliest that this could be was 1810 as the Kennet and Avon Canal was opened through to the [[River Thames|Thames]] that year.\n\nThe ribs of the hull were built from [[oak]]. There was a steam chest behind the shed (now the public toilet block) where the wood could be shaped. However the Edwards family preferred to find wood naturally shaped.\n\nThe hull was planked with [[Pinus rigida|pitch pine]]. Pitch pine was used because it was lightweight and came in long lengths so required less joints. [[Elm]] was tried, and although it was more water resistant, it was heavier and therefore the barge had a lower cargo capacity.\n\nThe barge was flat bottomed and straight sided, this meant that it could operate in shallow water with a reasonable cargo. Once the hull was complete it was covered in pitch to create a watertight finish. The barge was built on trestles to keep it off the ground and assist in launching.  Only the hull was built in the shed. On completion the water side of the shed was removed and the barge was launched sideways. The barge was then towed up to the area where the pleasure boats are moored today and it was here that fitting out was completed. This was also the area used to repair barges.\n\nThe Wey barge was {{convert|22.5|m|ft}} in length and the width was constrained by the narrowest lock to {{convert|4.3|m|ft}}. A barge would have only centimetres to spare when going through the lock.\n\nA Wey barge could carry 80 tonnes of cargo from the Thames to Coxes mill. From Coxes going upstream the capacity was reduced to 50 tonnes as far as Guildford and further reduced for the journey to Godalming owing to the decrease in the depth of water available.\n\n==Goods carried by the barges==\n\nA variety of goods were transported along the navigation, for example:\n* Wheat grain or barley from Victoria Docks in London to Coxes mill.\n* Gunpowder from Chilworth to Barking or Woolwich\n* Wood pulp from London docks to Woking paper mill\n* Timber from Guildford to London.\n\nWith no engines or sails the barges were towed by horses or people, and occasionally poled or rowed. Once a Wey barge reached the Thames it would be towed by tug boats. The horses were rested in stables along the Navigation. The Navigation owned three stables, at Thames lock, Coxes Mill and Friary Street. The bargemen would pay to use the stables. Local inns along the towpath also provided stabling facilities.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|United Kingdom|Transport|Surrey}}\n*[[Canals of the United Kingdom]]\n*[[History of the British canal system]]\n*Wey barge ''[[Perseverance IV]]''\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{commons category}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/river-wey-and-godalming-navigations-and-dapdune-wharf River Wey and Godalming Navigations and Dapdune Wharf] - National Trust\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080905110713/http://www.guildford.gov.uk/GuildfordWeb/Tourism/Groups/DapduneWharf.htm Guildford Borough Council web page on Dapdune Wharf]\n\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Surrey]]\n[[Category:National Trust properties in Surrey]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Guildford]]\n[[Category:Maritime museums in England]]\n[[Category:Museums in Surrey]]\n", "name_user": "I dream of horses", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up,typo(s) fixed: part time \u2192 part-time, \u2019s \u2192 's (2)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dapdune_Wharf"}

[[Endemic (ecology)|Endemic]] to [[Africa]], it is usually found in the open grasslands and savannah of the [[Sub-Saharan Africa|sub-Saharan region]]. [[John Frederick Miller]] described the species in 1779. Although a member of the order [[Accipitriformes]], which also includes many other [[Diurnal animal|diurnal]] birds of prey such as [[kite (bird)|kites]], [[hawk]]s, [[vulture]]s, and [[harrier (bird)|harriers]], it is placed in its own family, [[Sagittariidae]]. The secretarybird is instantly recognisable as a very large bird with an eagle-like body on [[crane (bird)|crane-like]] legs which increases the bird's height to as much as {{convert|1.3|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The sexes are similar in appearance. Adults have a featherless red-orange face and predominantly grey plumage, with a flattened dark crest and black [[flight feather]]s and thighs.\n\nBreeding can take place at any time of year, but tends to be late in the dry season. The nest is built at the top of a thorny tree, and a clutch of one to three eggs is laid. In years with plentiful food all three young can survive to fledging. The secretarybird hunts and catches prey on the ground, often stomping on victims to kill them. Rodents and grasshoppers likely form the bulk of its diet, though it does kill snakes. \n\nAlthough the secretarybird occurs over a very large range, anecdotal observations and the results of localised surveys suggest that the total population is experiencing a rapid decline, probably as a result of habitat degradation. The species is therefore classed as [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]]. The secretarybird appears on the [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]] of [[Emblem of Sudan|Sudan]] and [[Coat of arms of South Africa|South Africa]].\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n{{Cladogram\n|caption=Position of the secretarybird in the order [[Accipitriformes]].

Although little is known about its visual field, it is assumed that it is large, frontal and binocular. Secretarybirds have unusually long legs (nearly twice as long as other ground birds of the same body mass), which is thought to be an adaptation for the bird's unique stomping/striking hunting method. However, these long limbs appear to also lower its running efficiency.

[[Endemic (ecology)|Endemic]] to [[Africa]], it is usually found in the open grasslands and savannah of the [[Sub-Saharan Africa|sub-Saharan region]]. [[John Frederick Miller]] described the species in 1779. Although a member of the order [[Accipitriformes]], which also includes many other [[Diurnal animal|diurnal]] birds of prey such as [[kite (bird)|kites]], [[hawk]]s, [[vulture]]s, and [[harrier (bird)|harriers]], it is placed in its own family, [[Sagittariidae]]. The secretarybird is instantly recognisable as a very large bird with an eagle-like body on [[crane (bird)|crane-like]] legs which increases the bird's height to as much as {{convert|1.3|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The sexes are similar in appearance. Adults have a featherless red-orange face and predominantly grey plumage, with a flattened dark crest and black [[flight feather]]s and thighs.\n\nBreeding can take place at any time of year, but tends to be late in the dry season. The nest is built at the top of a thorny tree, and a clutch of one to three eggs is laid. In years with plentiful food all three young can survive to fledging. The secretarybird hunts and catches prey on the ground, often stomping on victims to kill them. Rodents and grasshoppers likely form the bulk of its diet, though it does kill snakes. \n\nAlthough the secretarybird occurs over a very large range, anecdotal observations and the results of localised surveys suggest that the total population is experiencing a rapid decline, probably as a result of habitat degradation. The species is therefore classed as [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]]. The secretarybird appears on the [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]] of [[Emblem of Sudan|Sudan]] and [[Coat of arms of South Africa|South Africa]].\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n{{Cladogram\n|caption=Position of the secretarybird in the order [[Accipitriformes]].

Although little is known about its visual field, it is assumed that it is large, frontal and binocular. Secretarybirds have unusually long legs (nearly twice as long as other ground birds of the same body mass), which is thought to be an adaptation for the bird's unique stomping/striking hunting method. However, these long limbs appear to also lower its running efficiency.
