Founded in 1934\u20131935, the '''Bourbaki group''' originally intended to prepare a new [[textbook]] in [[mathematical analysis|analysis]].  Over time the project became much more ambitious, growing into a large series of textbooks published under the Bourbaki name, meant to treat modern [[pure mathematics]].  The series is known collectively as the ''[[\u00c9l\u00e9ments de math\u00e9matique]]'' (''Elements of Mathematics''), the group's central work.  Topics treated in the series include [[set theory]], [[abstract algebra]], [[topology]], analysis, [[Lie group]]s and [[Lie algebra]]s.\n\nBourbaki was founded in response to the effects of the [[First World War]] which caused the death of a generation of French mathematicians; as a result, young university instructors were forced to use dated texts.  While teaching at the [[University of Strasbourg]], [[Henri Cartan]] complained to his colleague [[Andr\u00e9 Weil]] of the inadequacy of available course material, which prompted Weil to propose a meeting with others in Paris to collectively write a modern analysis textbook.  The group's core founders were Cartan, [[Claude Chevalley]], [[Jean Delsarte]], [[Jean Dieudonn\u00e9]] and Weil; others participated briefly during the group's early years, and membership has changed gradually over time.  Although former members openly discuss their past involvement with the group, Bourbaki has a custom of keeping its current membership secret.\n\nThe group's namesake derives from the 19th century French general [[Charles-Denis Bourbaki]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Apprenticeship of a Mathematician|last=Weil|first=Andr\u00e9|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user Verlag|year=1992|isbn=978-3764326500|location=|pages=93\u2013122|author-link=Andr\u00e9 Weil}}</ref> who had a career of successful military campaigns before suffering a dramatic loss in the [[Franco-Prussian War]].  As a result, Bourbaki's name became known to early 20th century French students.  Weil remembered an ENS [[student prank]] in which an upperclassman posed as a professor and presented a \"theorem of Bourbaki\"; the name was later adopted.\n\nThe Bourbaki group holds regular private conferences for the purpose of drafting and expanding the ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments''.  Topics are assigned to subcommittees, drafts are debated, and unanimous agreement is required before a text is deemed fit for publication.  Although slow and labor-intensive, the process results in a work which meets the group's standards for [[rigour]] and generality.  The group is also associated with the [[S\u00e9minaire Bourbaki]], a regular series of lectures presented by members and non-members of the group, also published and disseminated as written documents.  Bourbaki maintains an office at the ENS.{{sfn|Beaulieu|1999|p=221}}\n\nNicolas Bourbaki was influential in 20th century mathematics, particularly during the middle of the century when volumes of the ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments'' appeared frequently.  The group is noted among mathematicians for its rigorous presentation and for introducing the notion of a [[mathematical structure]], an idea related to the broader, interdisciplinary concept of [[structuralism]].{{sfn|Aczel|pp=129-148}}{{sfn|Aubin|p=314}}{{sfn|Mashaal|pp=70-85}}  Bourbaki's work informed the [[New Math]], a trend in elementary math education during the 1960s.  Although the group remains active, its influence is considered to have declined due to infrequent publication of new volumes of the ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments''.  However the collective's most recent publication appeared in 2016, treating [[algebraic topology]].\n\n==Background==\n\n[[File:Portrait Bourbaki.JPG|thumb|left|200px|[[Charles-Denis Bourbaki]], 19th century general and namesake of the collective]]\n\nCharles-Denis Sauter Bourbaki was born on 22 April 1816 in [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]], France, to a family of Greek origin.  He became a successful general during the era of [[Napoleon III]], serving in the [[Crimean War]] and other conflicts.  During the [[Franco-Prussian war]] however, Charles-Denis Bourbaki suffered a major defeat.  At the time of the [[siege of Metz (1870)|Siege of Metz]], he was lured to Britain on false pretenses of a peace conference, and upon return to the continent he was tasked with lifting the [[Siege of Belfort]], an effort which failed.  Charles-Denis Bourbaki was forced to retreat with his army\u2014the [[Arm\u00e9e de l'Est]]\u2014across the Swiss border.  The force was disarmed by the Swiss, and the general unsuccessfully attempted suicide.  Charles-Denis Bourbaki later died on 27 September 1897, and the dramatic story of his defeat entered the French consciousness.{{sfn|Aczel|pp=61-63}}{{sfn|Mashaal|pp=22-25}}\n\n[[File:Gustav_Herglotz,_Gaston_Julia.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|[[Gaston Julia]] (right), who was not a member of Bourbaki, lost his nose during World War I.  The war created a lost generation of mathematical knowledge, which the Bourbaki founders sought to fill.]]  In the early 20th century, the First World War affected Europeans of all professions and social classes, including mathematicians and male students who fought and died in the front.  For example, the French mathematician [[Gaston Julia]], a pioneer in the study of [[fractal]]s, lost his nose during the war and wore a leather strap over the affected part of his face for the rest of his life.  The deaths of ENS students resulted in a [[lost generation]] in the French mathematical community;{{sfn|Borel|p=373}} the estimated proportion of ENS mathematics students (and French students generally) who died in the war ranges from one-quarter to one-half, depending on the intervals of time (circa 1900-1918, especially 1910-1916) and populations considered.{{sfn|Aczel|p=82}}{{sfn|Mashaal|pp=44-45}} Furthermore, Bourbaki founder Andr\u00e9 Weil remarked in his memoir ''Apprenticeship of a Mathematician'' that France and Germany took different approaches with their intellegentsia during the war: while Germany protected its young students and scientists, France instead committed them to the front, owing to the French [[Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9|culture]] of [[egalitarianism]].{{sfn|Mashaal|pp=44-45}}\n\nA succeeding generation of mathematics students attended the ENS during the 1920s, including Weil and others, the future founders of Bourbaki.  During his time as a student, Weil recalled a prank in which an upperclassman, [[:fr:Raoul Husson|Raoul Husson]]<small>[[:fr:Wikip\u00e9dia:Accueil_principal|[fr]]]</small>, posed as a professor and gave a math lecture, ending with a prompt: \"Theorem of Bourbaki: you are to prove the following...\".  Weil was also aware of a similar stunt in which a student claimed to be from the fictional, impoverished nation of \"Poldevia\" and soliticed the public for donations.{{sfn|Aczel|pp=63-65}}{{sfn|Mashaal|p=23}}  Weil had strong interests in languages and [[Indian culture]], having learned [[Sanskrit]] and read the [[Bhagavad Gita]].{{sfn|Aczel|pp=25-26}}{{sfn|Mashaal|pp=35-37}}  After graduating from the ENS and obtaining his doctorate, Weil took a teaching stint at the [[Aligarh Muslim University]] in India.  While there, Weil met the mathematician [[Damodar Dharmananda Kosambi|Damodar Kosambi]], who was engaged in a power struggle with one of his colleagues.  Weil suggested that Kosambi write an article with material attributed to one \"Bourbaki\", in order to show off his knowledge to the colleague.{{sfn|Beaulieu|1999|p=239}}  Kosambi took the suggestion, attributing the material discussed in the article to \"the little-known Russian mathematician '''D. Bourbaki''', who was poisoned during the Revolution.\"  It was the first article in the mathematical literature with material attributed to the eponymous \"Bourbaki\".{{sfn|Aczel|p=65}}<ref>{{cite book |chapter=On a Generalization of the Second Theorem of Bourbaki |last=Kosambi |first=Damodar Dharmananda |title=D.D.

However, Weil and Vijayaraghavan respected one another.  Rather than play any role in the drama, Vijayaraghavan instead resigned, later informing Weil of the plan.{{sfn|Aczel|pp=32-34}}  Weil returned to Europe to seek another teaching position.  He ended up at the University of Strasbourg, joining his friend and colleague Henri Cartan.{{sfn|Aczel|p=81}}\n\n==The Bourbaki collective==\n\n[[File:Integral as region under curve.svg|thumb|left|200px|Bourbaki was founded to produce a text in [[mathematical analysis]], a branch of mathematics entailing [[calculus]]]]\n\n===Founding===\nDuring their time together at Strasbourg, Weil and Cartan regularly complained to each other regarding the inadequacy of available course material for [[calculus]] instruction.  In his memoir ''Apprenticeship'', Weil described his solution in the following terms: \"One winter day toward the end of 1934, I came upon a great idea that would put an end to these ceaseless interrogations by my comrade. 'We are five or six friends', I told him some time later, 'who are in charge of the same mathematics curriculum at various universities.  Let us all come together and regulate these matters once and for all, and after this, I shall be delivered of these questions.' I was unaware of the fact that Bourbaki was born at that instant.\"{{sfn|Aczel|p=81}}  Cartan confirmed the account.{{sfn|Mashaal|p=4}}\n\n[[File:Paris-Pantheon-106-2017-gje.jpg|thumb|right|Bourbaki's initial meetings were held in a restaurant in the [[Latin Quarter]] of Paris, near the [[Panth\u00e9on]]]]\n\nThe first, unofficial meeting of the Bourbaki collective took place at noon on Monday, 10 December 1934, at the Caf\u00e9 Grill-Room A.

Further, in the aftermath of World War I, there was a certain nationalist impulse to save French mathematics from decline, especially in competition with Germany.  As Dieudonn\u00e9 stated in an interview, \"Without meaning to boast, I can say that it was Bourbaki that saved French mathematics from extinction.\"{{sfn|Mashaal|pp=38-45}}\n\nJean Delsarte was particularly favorable to the collective aspect of the proposed project, observing that such a working style could insulate the group's work against potential later individual claims of [[copyright]].{{sfn|Aczel|p=84}}{{sfn|Mashaal|pp=7,14}}{{efn|Delsarte's favorable view of a collective project was not recorded in the minutes of the first meeting.

During the malaise, some decided to [[Nude swimming|skinny-dip]] in the nearby [[Lac Pavin]], repeatedly yelling \"Bourbaki!\"{{sfn|Mashaal|p=22}}  At the close of the first official conference, the group renamed itself \"Bourbaki\", in reference to the general and prank as recalled by Weil and others.{{sfn|Mashaal|p=11}}{{efn|The mathematician Sterling K.

However Mashaal dismissed this connection as being unlikely, since the founders never referred to the novel, but only to the general and the Husson anecdote.{{sfn|Mashaal|pp=25-26}} }}  During 1935, the group also resolved to establish the mathematical [[personhood]] of their collective pseudonym by getting an article published under its name.{{sfn|Aczel|p=90}}{{sfn|Mashaal|pp=27-29}}  A first name had to be decided; a full name was required for publication of any article.

Eveline remarried to Andr\u00e9 Weil in 1937, and de Possel left the Bourbaki collective some time later.  This sequence of events has caused speculation that de Possel left the group because of the remarriage,{{sfn|Mashaal|p=17}} however this suggestion has also been criticized as possibly historically inaccurate, since de Possel is supposed to have remained active in Bourbaki for years after Andr\u00e9's marriage to Eveline.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.neverendingbooks.org/the-bumpy-road-to-the-first-bourbaki-congress |title=The Bumpy Road to the First Bourbaki Congress |date=22 October 2009 |website=neverendingbooks.org}}</ref>\n\n===World War II===\n\nBourbaki's work slowed significantly during the [[Second World War]], though the group survived and later flourished.  Some members of Bourbaki were Jewish, and therefore obliged to flee from certain parts of Europe at certain times. Weil, who was Jewish, spent the summer of 1939 in Finland with his wife Eveline, as guests of [[Lars Ahlfors]].  Due to their travel near the border, the couple were suspected as Soviet spies by Finnish authorities near the onset of the [[Winter War]], and Andr\u00e9 was later arrested.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.icmihistory.unito.it/portrait/nevanlinna.php |title=Rolf Nevanlinna |website=icmihistory.unito.it}}</ref>  According to an anecdote, Weil was to have been executed but for the passing mention of his case to [[Rolf Nevanlinna]], who asked that Weil's sentence be commuted.{{sfn|Aczel|pp=17-36}}  However, the accuracy of this detail is dubious.<ref>[[Osmo Pekonen]]: ''L'affaire Weil \u00e0 Helsinki en 1939'', Gazette des math\u00e9maticiens 52 (avril 1992), pp. 13\u201420. With an afterword by Andr\u00e9 Weil.</ref>  Weil reached the United States in 1941, later taking another teaching stint in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] from 1945-47 before settling at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1947-1958 and finally the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton]], where he spent the remainder of his career.  Although Weil remained in touch with the Bourbaki collective and visited Europe and the group periodically following the war, his level of involvement with Bourbaki never returned to that at the time of founding.\n\nSecond-generation Bourbaki member [[Laurent Schwartz]] was also Jewish and found pickup work as a math teacher in rural [[Vichy France]].  Moving from village to village, Schwartz planned his movements in order to evade capture by the [[Nazi]]s.{{sfn|Senechal|pp=22-28}}  On one occasion Schwartz found himself trapped overnight in a certain village, as his expected transportation home was unavailable.  There were two inns in town: a comfortable, well-appointed one, and a very poor one with no heating and bad beds.  Schwartz's instinct told him to stay at the poor inn; overnight, the Nazis raided the good inn, leaving the poor inn unchecked.{{sfn|Aczel|p=40}}\n\nMeanwhile Jean Delsarte, a Catholic, was mobilized in 1939 as the captain of an audio reconnaissance battery.  He was forced to lead the unit's retreat from the northeastern part of France toward the south.  While passing near the Swiss border, Delsarte overheard a soldier say \"We are the army of Bourbaki\";{{sfn|Aczel|p=98}}{{sfn|Mashaal|pp=20-24}} the 19th century general's retreat was known to the French.  Delsarte had coincidentally led a retreat similar to that of the collective's namesake.\n\n===Postwar until the present===\n\n{{multiple image\n|align=left\n|direction=vertical\n|width=140\n|image1=Commutative diagram for morphism.svg\n|image2=Venn A intersect B.svg\n|caption2=[[Alexander Grothendieck]] proposed that Bourbaki revise its foundational basis in terms of [[category theory]] as opposed to [[set theory]]; the proposal was not adopted\n}}\n\nFollowing the war, Bourbaki had solidified the plan of its work, and settled into a productive routine.  Bourbaki regularly published volumes of the ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments'' during the 1950s and 1960s, and enjoyed its greatest influence during this period.{{sfn|Aczel|p=117}}{{sfn|Beaulieu|1999|p=237}}  Over time the founding members gradually left the group, slowly being replaced with younger newcomers including [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] and [[Alexander Grothendieck]].  Serre, Grothendieck and Laurent Schwartz were awarded the [[Fields Medal]] during the postwar period, in 1954, 1966 and 1950 respectively.  Later members [[Alain Connes]] and [[Jean-Christophe Yoccoz]] also received the Fields Medal, in 1982 and 1994 respectively.{{sfn|Mashaal|p=19}}\n\nThe later practice of accepting scientific awards contrasted with some of the founders' views.{{sfn|Guedj|p=19}}  During the 1930s, Weil and Delsarte petitioned against a French national scientific \"medal system\" proposed by the [[Nobel prize|Nobel]] [[Nobel Prize in Physics|physics]] laureate [[Jean Perrin]].  Weil and Delsarte felt that the institution of such a system would increase unconstructive pettiness and jealousy in the scientific community.{{sfn|Mashaal|p=49}}  Despite this, the Bourbaki group had previously successfully petitioned Perrin for a government [[Grant (money)|grant]] to support its normal operations.{{sfn|Mashaal|pp=14-16}}  Like the founders, Grothendieck was also averse to awards, albeit for [[pacifism|pacifist]] reasons.  Although Grothendieck was awarded the Fields Medal in 1966, he declined to attend the ceremony in Moscow, in protest of the Soviet government.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.icm2018.org/wp/2018/08/03/sir-michael-atiyah-shares-memory-of-fields-win/ |title=Sir Michael Atiyah shares memory of Fields win |date=3 August 2018 |publisher=[[International Congress of Mathematicians]]}}</ref>  In 1988, Grothendieck rejected the [[Crafoord Prize]] outright, citing no personal need to accept prize money, lack of recent relevant output, and general distrust of the scientific community.<ref name=\"crafoord\">{{cite web |url=http://www.math.columbia.edu/~lipyan/CrafoordPrize.pdf |last=Grothendieck |first=Alexander |title=Crafoord Prize letter, English translation |accessdate=2005-06-17 |url-status = bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060106062005/http://www.math.columbia.edu/~lipyan/CrafoordPrize.pdf |archivedate=6 January 2006 |df=dmy}}</ref>\n\nBorn to Jewish [[anarchist]] parentage, Grothendieck survived the [[Holocaust]] and advanced rapidly in the French mathematical community, despite poor education during the war.{{sfn|Aczel|pp=9-10}}  Grothendieck's teachers included Bourbaki's founders, and so he joined the group.  During Grothendieck's membership, Bourbaki reached an impasse concerning its foundational approach.  Grothendieck advocated for a reformulation of the group's work using [[category theory]] as its theoretical basis, as opposed to set theory.  The proposal was ultimately rejected{{sfn|Aubin|p=328}}{{sfn|Beaulieu|1999|pp=236-237}}{{sfn|Corry|2009|pp=38-51}} in part because the group had already committed itself to a rigid track of sequential presentation, with multiple already-published volumes.  Following this, Grothendieck left Bourbaki \"in anger\".<ref name=\"numericana\" />{{sfn|Senechal|pp=22-28}}{{sfn|Aczel|p=119}}  Biographers of the collective have described Bourbaki's unwillingness to start over in terms of category theory as a missed opportunity.{{sfn|Senechal|pp=22-28}}{{sfn|Aczel|p=205}}{{sfn|Mashaal|pp=81-84}}\n\nDuring the founding period, the group chose the Parisian publisher [[\u00c9ditions Hermann|Hermann]] to issue installments of the ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments''.  Hermann was led by Enrique Freymann, a friend of the founders willing to publish the group's project, despite financial risk.  During the 1970s, Bourbaki entered a protracted legal battle with Hermann over matters of copyright and [[royalty payment]].  Although the Bourbaki group won the suit and retained collective copyright of the ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments'', the dispute slowed the group's productivity.{{sfn|Aczel|pp=205-206}}{{sfn|Mashaal|pp=7, 51-54}}  Former member Pierre Cartier described the lawsuit as a [[pyrrhic victory]], saying: \"As usual in legal battles, both parties lost and the lawyer got rich.\"{{sfn|Senechal|pp=22-28}}  Later editions of the ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments'' were published by [[Masson (publisher)|Masson]], and modern editions are published by [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]].<ref>[https://www.springer.com/series/47 Elements of Mathematics] series in Springer</ref>  From the 1980s through the 2000s, Bourbaki published very infrequently, with the result that in 1998 ''[[Le Monde]]'' pronounced the collective \"dead\".{{sfn|Mashaal|p=146}}  However, in the 2010s Bourbaki resumed publication of the ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments'' with a revised chapter on algebra and a new book on algebraic topology.\n\n==Working method==\n\n[[File:Finite coxeter.svg|thumb|right|400px|At [[Armand Borel]]'s urging, Bourbaki's treatment of Lie groups and Lie algebras included uncharacteristic illustrations, such as graphs of finite [[Coxeter systems]]<ref name=\"lie\">{{cite book |last=Bourbaki |first=Nicolas |title=Lie Groups and Lie Algebras, Chapters 4-6 |publisher=Springer |date=2002 |isbn=9783540691716 |pages=205\u2013206}}</ref>]]\n\nBourbaki holds periodic conferences for the purpose of expanding the ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments''; these conferences are the central activity of the group's working life.  Subcommittees are assigned to write drafts on specific material, and the drafts are later presented, vigorously debated and re-drafted at the conferences.  Unanimous agreement is required before any material is deemed acceptable for publication.{{sfn|Aczel|p=92}}{{sfn|Borel|p=375}}{{sfn|Guedj|p=18}}  A given piece of material may require six or more drafts over a period of several years, and some drafts are never developed into completed work.{{sfn|Borel|p=375}}{{sfn|Guedj|p=20}}  Bourbaki's writing process has therefore been described as \"[[Sisyphus|Sisyphean]]\".{{sfn|Guedj|p=18}}  Although the method is slow, it yields a final product which satisfies the group's standards for [[mathematical rigour]], one of Bourbaki's main priorities in the treatise.  Bourbaki's emphasis on rigour was a reaction to the style of [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]], who stressed the importance of free-flowing mathematical [[intuition]] at the cost of thorough presentation.{{efn|\"Bourbaki came to terms with Poincar\u00e9 only after a long struggle. When I joined the group in the fifties it was not the fashion to value Poincar\u00e9 at all. He was old-fashioned.\" \u2014Pierre Cartier{{sfn|Senechal|pp=22-28}} }}  During the project's early years, Dieudonn\u00e9 served as the group's scribe, authoring several final drafts which were ultimately published.  For this purpose, Dieudonn\u00e9 adopted an impersonal [[writing style]] which was not his own, but which was used to craft material acceptable to the entire group.{{sfn|Aczel|p=116}}{{sfn|Borel|p=376}}  Dieudonn\u00e9 reserved his personal style for his own work; like all members of Bourbaki, Dieudonn\u00e9 also published material under his own name,{{sfn|Mashaal|p=69}} including the nine-volume ''[[Treatise on analysis|\u00c9l\u00e9ments d'analyse]]'', a work explicitly focused on analysis and of a piece with Bourbaki's initial intentions.  \n\nMost of the final drafts of Bourbaki's ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments'' carefully avoided using illustrations, favoring a formal presentation based only in text and formulas.  An exception to this was the treatment of Lie groups and Lie algebras (especially in chapters 4-6), which did make use of diagrams and illustrations.  The inclusion of illustration in this part of the work was due to [[Armand Borel]].  Borel was minority-Swiss in a majority-French collective, and [[Self-deprecation|self-deprecated]] as \"the Swiss peasant\", explaining that [[visual learning]] was important to the Swiss national character.{{sfn|Senechal|pp=22-28}}{{sfn|Aczel|pp=111-112}}  When asked about the dearth of illustration in the work, former member [[Pierre Cartier (mathematician)|Pierre Cartier]] replied:\n\n{{quote|text=The Bourbaki were [[Puritan]]s, and Puritans are strongly opposed to pictorial representations of truths of their faith. The number of Protestants and Jews in the Bourbaki group was overwhelming. And you know that the [[Protestantism in France|French Protestant]]s especially are very close to Jews in spirit. |title=Pierre Cartier{{sfn|Senechal|pp=22-28}} }}\n\nThe conferences have historically been held at quiet rural areas.{{sfn|Beaulieu|1999|pp=225-226}}  These locations contrast with the lively, sometimes heated debates which have occurred.  Laurent Schwartz reported an episode in which Weil slapped Cartan on the head with a draft.  The hotel's proprietor saw the incident and assumed that the group would split up, but according to Schwartz, \"peace was restored within ten minutes.\"{{sfn|Mashaal|pp=112-113}}  The historical, confrontational style of debate within Bourbaki has been partly attributed to Weil, who believed that new ideas have a better chance of being born in confrontation than in an orderly discussion.{{sfn|Borel|p=375}}{{sfn|Mashaal|pp=112-113}}  Schwartz related another illustrative incident: Dieudonn\u00e9 was adamant that [[topological vector spaces]] must appear in the work before [[Integral|integration]], and whenever anyone suggested that the order be reversed, he would loudly threaten his resignation. This became an in-joke among the group; [[Roger Godement|Roger Godement's]] wife Sonia attended a conference, aware of the idea, and asked for proof. As Sonia arrived at a meeting, a member suggested that integration must appear before topological vector spaces, which triggered Dieudonn\u00e9's usual reaction.{{sfn|Mashaal|pp=112-113}}  \n\nDespite the historical culture of heated argument, Bourbaki thrived during the middle of the twentieth century.  Bourbaki's ability to sustain such a collective, critical approach has been described as \"something unusual\",<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sabelli |first1=H\u00e9ctor |contribution=Foreword |contributor-last=Kauffman |contributor-first=Louis H. |contributor-link=Louis Kauffman |title=BIOS: a Study of Creation |year=2005 |publisher=[[World Scientific]] |location=Singapore |series=Series on Knots and Everything |volume=35 |page=423 |ISBN=9789812561039 }}</ref> surprising even its own members.

For example, in 1939 the group released a wedding announcement for the marriage of \"Betti Bourbaki\" (daughter of Nicolas) to one \"[[Hoist with his own petard|H. P\u00e9tard]]\" (H. \"Firecrackers\" or \"Hector P\u00e9tard\"), a \"lion hunter\".{{sfn|Beaulieu|1999|pp=239-240}}  Hector P\u00e9tard was itself a pseudonym, but not one originally coined by the Bourbaki members.  The P\u00e9tard moniker was originated by [[Ralph P. Boas]], [[Frank Smithies]] and other [[Princeton]] mathematicians who were aware of the Bourbaki project; inspired by them, the Princeton mathematicians published an article on the \"mathematics of lion hunting\".  After meeting Boas and Smithies, Weil composed the wedding announcement which contained several mathematical puns.{{sfn|Mashaal|pp=30, 113-114}}  Bourbaki's internal newsletter ''La Tribu'' has sometimes been issued with humorous subtitles to describe a given conference, such as \"The Extraordinary Congress of Old Fogies\" (where anyone older than 30 was considered a fogy) or \"The Congress of the Motorization of the Trotting Ass\" (an expression used to describe the routine unfolding of a mathematical proof, or process).{{sfn|Beaulieu|1999|p=226}}{{sfn|Mashaal|pp=110-111}}\n\nDuring the 1940s-1950s,{{sfn|Beaulieu|1999|p=241}}{{sfn|Mashaal|pp=33-34}} the [[American Mathematical Society]] received applications for individual membership from Bourbaki.  They were rebuffed by [[John Robert Kline|J.R. Kline]] who understood the entity to be a collective, inviting them to re-apply for institutional membership at a higher rate.  In response, Bourbaki floated a rumor that Ralph Boas was not a real person, but a collective pseudonym of the editors of ''[[Mathematical Reviews]]'' with which Boas had been affiliated.  The reason for targeting Boas was because he had known the group in its earlier days when they were less strict with secrecy, and he'd described them as a collective in an article for the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]''.{{sfn|Aczel|pp=121-123}}  In November 1968, a mock obituary of Nicolas Bourbaki was released during one of the seminars.{{sfn|Beaulieu|1999|pp=241-242}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.neverendingbooks.org/according-to-groth-iv-22 |title=According to Groth.

The noun \"Bourbaki\" might refer to the group proper or to an individual member, e.g. \"Andr\u00e9 Weil was a Bourbaki.\"  \"Bourbakist\" is sometimes used to refer to members<ref name=\"numericana\" /> but also denotes associates, supporters, and enthusiasts.{{sfn|Beaulieu|1993|p=31}}{{sfn|Beaulieu|1999|p=227}}  To \"bourbakize\" meant to take a poor existing text and to improve it through an editing process.{{sfn|Guedj|p=20}}\n\nBourbaki's culture of humor has been described as an important factor in the group's social cohesion and capacity to survive, smoothing over tensions of heated debate.{{sfn|Mashaal|p=115}}  As of {{year}}, a [[Twitter]] account registered to \"Betty_Bourbaki\" provides regular updates on the group's activity.<ref name=\"betty\">{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/betty_bourbaki |title=Compte twitter officiel de l'Association des collaborateurs de N.

The textbook series ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments de math\u00e9matique'' ''(Elements of mathematics)'' is the group's central work.  The [[S\u00e9minaire Bourbaki]] is a lecture series held regularly under the group's auspices, and the talks given are also published as lecture notes.  Journal articles have been published with authorship attributed to Bourbaki, and the group publishes an internal newsletter ''La Tribu'' (''The Tribe'') which is distributed to current and former members.<ref name=\"archiver\">{{cite web |url=http://archives-bourbaki.ahp-numerique.fr/elements-mathematique |title=\u00c9l\u00e9ments de Math\u00e9matique |website=Archives Bourbaki}}</ref>{{sfn|Mashaal|pp=108-109}}\n\n===''\u00c9l\u00e9ments de math\u00e9matique''===\n{{main|\u00c9l\u00e9ments de math\u00e9matique}}\n\nThe content of the ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments'' is divided into ''books''\u2014major topics of discussion, ''volumes''\u2014individual, physical books, and ''chapters'', together with certain summaries of results, historical notes, and other details.  The volumes of the ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments'' have had a complex publication history.  Material has been revised for new editions, published chronologically out of order of its intended logical sequence, grouped together and partitioned differently in later volumes, and translated into English.  For example, the second book on ''[[Abstract algebra|Algebra]]'' was originally released in eight French volumes: the first in 1942 being chapter 1 alone, and the last in 1980 being chapter 10 alone.  This presentation was later condensed into five volumes with chapters 1-3 in the first volume, chapters 4-7 in the second, and chapters 8-10 each remaining the third through fifth volumes of that portion of the work.<ref name=\"archiver\" />  The English edition of Bourbaki's ''Algebra'' consists of translations of the two volumes on chapters 1-3 and 4-7, with chapters 8-10 unavailable in English as of {{year}}.\n\nWhen Bourbaki's founders began working on the ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments'', they originally conceived of it as a \"treatise on analysis\", the proposed work having a working title of the same name (''Trait\u00e9 d'analyse'').  The opening part was to comprehensively deal with the [[foundations of mathematics]] prior to analysis, and was referred to as the \"Abstract Packet\".  Over time, the members developed this proposed \"opening section\" of the work to the point that it would instead run for several volumes and comprise a major part of the work, covering set theory, abstract algebra, and topology.  Once the project's scope expanded far beyond its original purpose, the working title ''Trait\u00e9 d'analyse'' was dropped in favor of ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments de math\u00e9matique''.{{sfn|Mashaal|p=11}}  The unusual, singular \"Mathematic\" was meant to connote Bourbaki's belief in the unity of mathematics.{{sfn|Aczel|pp=99-100}}{{sfn|Borel|p=374}}{{sfn|Mashaal|p=55}}\n\nThe volumes of the ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments'' published by Hermann were indexed by chronology of publication and referred to as ''[[wikt:fascicule|fascicules]]'': installments in a large work.  Some volumes did not consist of the normal definitions, proofs and exercises in a math textbook, but contained only summaries of results for a given topic, stated without proof.  These volumes were referred to as ''Fascicules de r\u00e9sultats'', with the result that ''fascicule'' may refer to a volume of Hermann's edition, or to one of the \"summary\" sections of the work (e.g. ''Fascicules de r\u00e9sultats'' is translated as \"Summary of Results\" rather than \"Installment of Results\", referring to the content rather than a specific volume).{{efn|The [[History of mathematics|mathematical historian]] [[Leo Corry]] also observed that the phrase \"Summary of Results\" is a misleading one for a distinct reason, instead referring to the content of the ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments'' rather than the publication history of its volumes.{{sfn|Corry|1992|p=326}}{{sfn|Corry|2004|p=320}} }}  The first volume of Bourbaki's ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments'' to be published was the Summary of Results in ''[[Set Theory]]'', in 1939.{{sfn|Senechal|pp=22-28}}<ref name=\"archiver\" />{{sfn|Mashaal|p=52}}  Similarly one of the work's later books, ''[[Differentiable manifold|Differential]] and [[Analytic manifold|Analytic Manifold]]s'', consisted only of two volumes of summaries of results, with no chapters of content having been published.\n\nLater installments of the ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments'' appeared infrequently during the 1980s and 1990s.  A volume of ''[[Commutative Algebra]]'' (chapters 8-9) was published in 1983, and no other volumes were issued until the appearance of the same book's tenth chapter in 1998.  During the 2010s, Bourbaki increased its productivity.  A re-written and expanded version of the eighth chapter of ''Algebra'' appeared in 2012, a new book treating ''[[Algebraic Topology]]'' was published in 2016, and a revised edition of ''[[Spectral theory|Spectral Theory]]'' was issued in 2019.\n\n[[File:Bourbaki, Theorie des ensembles maitrier.jpg|thumb|First book of the ''[[\u00c9l\u00e9ments de math\u00e9matique]]'', 1970 edition]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|+''\u00c9l\u00e9ments de math\u00e9matique''<ref name=\"archiver\" />{{efn|Years refer to the date of publication of each book's first volume, which also contains its first proper chapter.

''La Tribu'' usually lists the members present at a conference, together with any visitors, family members or other friends in attendance.  Humorous descriptions of location or local \"props\" (cars, bicycles, binoculars, etc) can also serve as [[mnemonic]] devices.{{sfn|Beaulieu|1999|p=226}}\n\n==Membership==\n\nAs of 2000, Bourbaki has had \"about forty\" members.{{sfn|Mashaal|p=18}}  Historically the group has numbered about ten{{sfn|Beaulieu|1999|p=220}} to twelve{{sfn|Senechal|pp=22-28}} members at any given point, although it was briefly (and officially) limited to nine members at the time of founding.{{sfn|Mashaal|p=8}}  Bourbaki's membership has been described in terms of generations:\n\n{{Quote|text=Bourbaki was always a very small group of mathematicians, typically numbering about twelve people.  Its first generation was that of the founding fathers, those who created the group in 1934: Weil, Cartan, Chevalley, Delsarte, de Possel, and Dieudonn\u00e9.  Others joined the group, and others left its ranks, so that some years later there were about twelve members, and that number remained roughly constant.  Laurent Schwartz was the only mathematician to join Bourbaki during the war, so his is considered an intermediate generation.  After the war, a number of members joined: [[Jean-Pierre Serre]], [[Pierre Samuel]], [[Jean-Louis Koszul]], [[Jacques Dixmier]], [[Roger Godement]], and [[Samuel Eilenberg|Sammy Eilenberg]].  These people constituted the second generation of Bourbaki.  In the 1950s, the third generation of mathematicians joined Bourbaki.  These people included [[Alexandre Grothendieck]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Bruhat]], [[Serge Lang]], the American mathematician [[John Tate]], [[Pierre Cartier (mathematician)|Pierre Cartier]], and the Swiss mathematician [[Armand Borel]].{{sfn|Senechal|pp=22-28}}{{sfn|Aczel|pp=108-109}} }}\n\nAfter the first three generations there were roughly twenty later members, not including current participants.  Bourbaki has a custom of keeping its current membership secret, a practice meant to ensure that its output is presented as a collective, unified effort under the Bourbaki pseudonym, not attributable to any one author (e.g. for purposes of copyright or royalty payment).  This secrecy is also intended to deter unwanted attention which could disrupt normal operations.  However, former members freely discuss Bourbaki's internal practices upon departure.{{sfn|Senechal|pp=22-28}}{{sfn|Mashaal|p=14}}\n\nProspective members are invited to conferences and styled as [[guinea pig]]s, a process meant to vet the newcomer's mathematical ability.{{sfn|Senechal|pp=22-28}}{{sfn|Mashaal|p=16}}  In the event of agreement between the group and the prospect, the prospect eventually becomes a full member.{{efn|Examples of guinea pigs who attended conferences without necessarily joining include one \"Mirl\u00e8s\", who attended the official founding conference in Besse-en-Chandesse, [[Marcel Berger]], [[Jean Giraud (mathematician)|Jean Giraud]], [[Bernard Malgrange]], and [[Ren\u00e9 Thom]].{{sfn|Aubin|p=330}}{{sfn|Beaulieu|1999|p=242}}{{sfn|Mashaal|pp=9, 109, 130}}  Other guinea pigs and visitors have also been listed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archives-bourbaki.ahp-numerique.fr/references/item-type-metadata-present |title=Membres pr\u00e9sents aux r\u00e9unions |website=Archives Bourbaki }}</ref> }}  The group is supposed to have an age limit: active members are expected to retire at (or about) 50 years of age.{{sfn|Senechal|pp=22-28}}{{sfn|Guedj|p=18}}  At a 1956 conference, Cartan read a letter from Weil which proposed a \"gradual disappearance\" of the founding members, forcing younger members to assume full responsibility for Bourbaki's operations.<ref name=\"numericana\" />{{sfn|Mashaal|pp=18-19}}  This rule is supposed to have resulted in a complete change of personnel by 1958.<ref name=\"Mainard\"/>  However, historian Liliane Beaulieu has been critical of the claim.

However, Andr\u00e9 Weil has been described as \"first among equals\" during the founding period, and was given some deference.{{sfn|Mashaal|p=12}}  On the other hand, the group has also poked fun at the idea that older members should be afforded greater respect.{{sfn|Mashaal|pp=111-112}}\n\nBourbaki conferences have also been attended by members' family, friends, visiting mathematicians, and other non-members of the group.{{efn|In 1948 one Nicolaidis Bourbaki, a diplomat and relative of the eponymous French general, sought the group out to understand why the family name had been taken.

This influence was in the context of [[structuralism]], a school of thought in the [[humanities]] which stresses the relationships between objects over the objects themselves, pursued in various fields by other French intellectuals.  In 1943, Andr\u00e9 Weil met the anthropologist [[Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss]] in New York, where the two undertook a brief collaboration.

David Aubin, a science historian who analyzed Bourbaki's role in the structuralist movement in France, believes Bourbaki's role was that of a \"cultural connector\".{{sfn|Aubin|p=297}}  According to Aubin, while Bourbaki didn't have any mission outside of mathematics, the group represented a sort of link between the various cultural movements of the time.  Bourbaki provided a simple and relatively precise definition of concepts and structures, which philosophers and social scientists believed was fundamental within their disciplines and in bridges among different areas of knowledge.  Despite the superficial nature of these links, the various schools of structuralist thinking, including Bourbaki, were able to support each other.  So, it is not a coincidence that these schools suffered a simultaneous decline in the late 1960s. |title=Maurice Mashaal, citing David Aubin{{sfn|Mashaal|p=73}}{{efn|Maurice Mashaal and Amir Aczel each wrote separate biographies on Bourbaki, both published in 2006.  In a review of both books, [[Michael Atiyah]] wrote that \"the basic historical facts are well known and are set out in both the books under review\".  However Atiyah identified Mashaal's book as the better of the two and criticized Aczel's book, writing: \"I was not convinced of the total reliability of its (Aczel's) sources, nor of its philosophical credentials.\"  Atiyah also wrote that the collaboration between Weil and L\u00e9vi-Strauss was a \"slightly tenuous link\" which Aczel used to make \"grand\" claims on the scale of Bourbaki's interdisciplinary influence.<ref name=\"Atiyah\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ams.org/notices/200709/tx070901150p.pdf |title=Book Review: Bourbaki, A Secret Society of Mathematicians and The Artist and the Mathematician, Reviewed by Michael Atiyah |last=Atiyah |first=Michael |publisher=American Mathematical Society |website=ams.org}}</ref>}}{{efn|In a 2011 letter to the ''Mathematical Intelligencer'', the mathematician [[:de:Jean-Michel Kantor|Jean-Michel Kantor]]<small>[[:de:Wikipedia:Hauptseite|[de]]]</small> was harshly critical of the notion that Bourbaki's mathematical structures had anything to do with the structuralism of the humanities, rejecting the connections made by Aczel in 2006.<ref name=\"Kantor\">{{cite journal |last=Kantor |first=Jean-Michel |title=Bourbaki's Structures and Structuralism |journal=Mathematical Intelligencer |volume=33 |issue=1 |page=1 |date=2011 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/251293966 |doi=10.1007/s00283-010-9173-4 |doi-access=free }}</ref>  Kantor observed that the two versions of structuralism had developed independently of one another, and that L\u00e9vi-Strauss' conception of structure had derived from the [[Prague linguistic circle|Prague circle]] of linguistics, not from Bourbaki.  On the other hand, Aczel had already acknowledged the linguistic origins of the structuralism of the humanities.{{sfn|Aczel|pp=149-159}}  In 1997 David Aubin had pre-emptively moderated both extremes, observing that the two schools of thought had distinct origins, but also had certain interactions and \"common features\".

The literary collective [[Oulipo]] was founded on 24 November 1960 under circumstances similar to Bourbaki's founding, with the members initially meeting in a restaurant.  Although several members of Oulipo were mathematicians, the group's purpose was to create [[experimental literature]] by playing with language.  Oulipo frequently employed mathematically-based [[constrained writing]] techniques, such as the [[Oulipo#Constraints|S+7 method]].

In particular, former member Armand Borel described the volume with chapters 4-6 as \"one of the most successful books by Bourbaki\".{{sfn|Borel|p=379}}  The success of this part of the work has been attributed to the fact that the books were composed while leading experts on the topic were Bourbaki members.{{sfn|Senechal|pp=22-28}}{{sfn|Aczel|p=111}}\n\n[[Jean-Pierre Bourguignon]] expressed appreciation for the S\u00e9minaire Bourbaki, saying that he'd learned a large amount of material at its lectures, and referred to its printed lecture notes regularly.{{sfn|Mashaal|p=102}}  He also praised the ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments'' for containing \"some superb and very clever proofs\".{{sfn|Mashaal|pp=54-55}}\n\n===Criticism===\n\nBourbaki has also been criticized by several mathematicians\u2014including its own former members\u2014for a variety of reasons.  Criticisms have included the choice of presentation of certain topics within the ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments'' at the expense of others,{{efn|This specific point has itself been criticized.  It has been observed that it is unfair to criticize a work on a given topic for not dealing with other topics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.math.nsc.ru/LBRT/g2/english/ssk/euclid.html |title=Apology of Euclid |author-link=Sem\u00ebn Samsonovich Kutateladze |last=Kutateladze |first=Sem\u00ebn Samsonovich }}</ref>{{sfn|Mashaal|pp=116-118}} }} dislike of the method of presentation for given topics, dislike of the group's working style, and a perceived [[Elitism|elitist]] mentality around Bourbaki's project and its books, especially during the collective's most productive years in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nBourbaki's deliberations on the ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments'' resulted in the inclusion of some topics, while others were not treated. When asked in a 1997 interview about topics left out of the ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments'', former member Pierre Cartier replied:\n\n{{quote|text=There is essentially no analysis beyond the foundations: nothing about [[partial differential equations]], nothing about [[probability]]. There is also nothing about [[combinatorics]], nothing about [[algebraic topology]],{{efn|Bourbaki has since published a book on algebraic topology.}} nothing about concrete [[geometry]]. And Bourbaki never seriously considered [[mathematical logic|logic]]. Dieudonn\u00e9 himself was very vocal against logic.  Anything connected with [[mathematical physics]] is totally absent from Bourbaki's text.|title=Pierre Cartier{{sfn|Senechal|pp=22-28}} }}\n\nAlthough Bourbaki had resolved to treat mathematics from its foundations, the group's eventual solution in terms of set theory was attended by several problems.  Bourbaki's members were mathematicians as opposed to [[logician]]s, and therefore the collective had a limited interest in [[mathematical logic]].{{sfn|Guedj|p=20}}  As Bourbaki's members themselves said of the book on set theory, it was written \"with pain and without pleasure, but we had to do it.\"{{sfn|Mashaal|p=121}}  Dieudonn\u00e9 personally remarked elsewhere that ninety-five percent of mathematicians \"don't care a fig\" for mathematical logic.{{sfn|Mashaal|p=120}}  In response, logician Adrian Mathias harshly criticized Bourbaki's foundational framework, noting that it did not take [[G\u00f6del]]'s results into account.{{sfn|Mashaal|pp=120-123}}<ref name=\"Mathias\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~ardm/bourbaki.pdf|title=The Ignorance of Bourbaki|last=Mathias|first=Adrian|date=August 22, 1990|website=dpmms.cam.ac.uk}}</ref>\n\nBourbaki also influenced the New Math, a failed{{sfn|Mashaal|p=135}} reform in Western mathematics education at the elementary and secondary levels, which stressed abstraction over concrete examples.  During the mid-20th century, reform in basic math education was spurred by a perceived need to create a mathematically literate workforce for the modern economy, and also to compete with the [[Soviet Union]].  In France, this led to the Lichnerowicz Commission of 1967, headed by [[Andr\u00e9 Lichnerowicz]] and including some (then-current and former) Bourbaki members.  Although Bourbaki members had previously (and individually) reformed math instruction at the university level, they had less direct involvement with implementation of the New Math at the primary and secondary levels.  New Math reforms resulted in instructional material which was incomprehensible to both students and teachers, failing to meet the [[Cognition|cognitive]] needs of younger students.  The attempted reform was harshly criticized by Dieudonn\u00e9 and also by brief founding Bourbaki participant Jean Leray.{{sfn|Mashaal|pp=134-145}}\n\n[[File:Benoit_Mandelbrot_mg_1804c.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Benoit Mandelbrot]] was among Bourbaki's critics]]\n\nDieudonn\u00e9 later regretted that Bourbaki's success had contributed to a [[Snob|snobbery]] for pure mathematics in France, at the expense of [[applied mathematics]].  In an interview, he said: \"It is possible to say that there was no serious applied mathematics in France for forty years after Poincar\u00e9.  There was even a snobbery for pure math.  When one noticed a talented student, one would tell him 'You should do pure math.'  On the other hand, one would advise a mediocre student to do applied math while thinking, \"It's all that he can do! ... The truth is actually the reverse.  You can't do good work in applied math until you can do good work in pure math.\"{{sfn|Mashaal|pp=118-119}}  Claude Chevalley confirmed an elitist culture within Bourbaki, describing it as \"an absolute certainty of our superiority over other mathematicians.\"{{sfn|Guedj|p=20}}  Alexander Grothendieck also confirmed an elitist mentality within Bourbaki.{{sfn|Corry|2009|pp=38-51}}  Some mathematicians, especially geometers and applied mathematicians, found Bourbaki's influence to be stifling.{{sfn|Aubin|p=313}}  Benoit Mandelbrot's decision to emigrate to the United States in 1958 was motivated in part by a desire to escape Bourbaki's influence in France.{{sfn|Mashaal|p=130}}\n\nSeveral related criticisms of the ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments'' have concerned its target audience and the intent of its presentation.  Volumes of the ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments'' begin with a note to the reader which says that the series \"takes up mathematics at the beginning, and gives complete proofs\" and that \"the method of exposition we have chosen is axiomatic and abstract, and normally proceeds from the general to the particular.\"<ref>''Theory of Sets'', p. v.</ref>  Despite the opening language, Bourbaki's intended audience are not absolute beginners in mathematics, but rather undergraduates, graduate students, and professors who are familiar with mathematical concepts.{{sfn|Mashaal|p=54}}  Claude Chevalley said that the ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments'' are \"useless for a beginner\",{{sfn|Guedj|p=22}} and Pierre Cartier clarified that \"The misunderstanding was that it should be a textbook for everybody.  That was the big disaster.\"{{sfn|Senechal|pp=22-28}}  \n\nThe work is divided into two halves.  While the first half treats established subjects, the second half deals with modern research areas like commutative algebra and spectral theory.  This divide in the work is related to a historical change in the intent of the treatise.  The ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments' '' content consists of theorems, proofs, exercises and related commentary, common material in math textbooks.  Despite this presentation, the first half was not written as [[original research]] but rather as a reorganized presentation of established knowledge.  In this sense, the ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments' '' first half was more akin to an [[encyclopedia]] than a textbook series.  As Cartier remarked, \"The misunderstanding was that many people thought it should be ''taught'' the way it was written in the books.  You can think of the first books of Bourbaki as an encyclopedia of mathematics... If you consider it as a textbook, it's a disaster.\"{{sfn|Senechal|pp=22-28}}  \n\nThe strict, ordered presentation of material in the ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments' '' first half was meant to form the basis for any further additions.  However, developments in modern mathematical research have proven difficult to adapt in terms of Bourbaki's organizational scheme.  This difficulty has been attributed to the fluid, dynamic nature of ongoing research which, being new, is not settled or fully understood.<ref name=\"Atiyah\" />{{sfn|Borel|pp=377-379}}  Bourbaki's style has been described as a particular scientific [[paradigm]] which has been superseded in a [[paradigm shift]].

Founded in 1934\u20131935, the '''Bourbaki group''' originally intended to prepare a new [[textbook]] in [[mathematical analysis|analysis]].  Over time the project became much more ambitious, growing into a large series of textbooks published under the Bourbaki name, meant to treat modern [[pure mathematics]].  The series is known collectively as the ''[[\u00c9l\u00e9ments de math\u00e9matique]]'' (''Elements of Mathematics''), the group's central work.  Topics treated in the series include [[set theory]], [[abstract algebra]], [[topology]], analysis, [[Lie group]]s and [[Lie algebra]]s.\n\nBourbaki was founded in response to the effects of the [[First World War]] which caused the death of a generation of French mathematicians; as a result, young university instructors were forced to use dated texts.  While teaching at the [[University of Strasbourg]], [[Henri Cartan]] complained to his colleague [[Andr\u00e9 Weil]] of the inadequacy of available course material, which prompted Weil to propose a meeting with others in Paris to collectively write a modern analysis textbook.  The group's core founders were Cartan, [[Claude Chevalley]], [[Jean Delsarte]], [[Jean Dieudonn\u00e9]] and Weil; others participated briefly during the group's early years, and membership has changed gradually over time.  Although former members openly discuss their past involvement with the group, Bourbaki has a custom of keeping its current membership secret.\n\nThe group's namesake derives from the 19th century French general [[Charles-Denis Bourbaki]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Apprenticeship of a Mathematician|last=Weil|first=Andr\u00e9|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user Verlag|year=1992|isbn=978-3764326500|location=|pages=93\u2013122|author-link=Andr\u00e9 Weil}}</ref> who had a career of successful military campaigns before suffering a dramatic loss in the [[Franco-Prussian War]].  As a result, Bourbaki's name became known to early 20th century French students.  Weil remembered an ENS [[student prank]] in which an upperclassman posed as a professor and presented a \"theorem of Bourbaki\"; the name was later adopted.\n\nThe Bourbaki group holds regular private conferences for the purpose of drafting and expanding the ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments''.  Topics are assigned to subcommittees, drafts are debated, and unanimous agreement is required before a text is deemed fit for publication.  Although slow and labor-intensive, the process results in a work which meets the group's standards for [[rigour]] and generality.  The group is also associated with the [[S\u00e9minaire Bourbaki]], a regular series of lectures presented by members and non-members of the group, also published and disseminated as written documents.  Bourbaki maintains an office at the ENS.{{sfn|Beaulieu|1999|p=221}}\n\nNicolas Bourbaki was influential in 20th century mathematics, particularly during the middle of the century when volumes of the ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments'' appeared frequently.  The group is noted among mathematicians for its rigorous presentation and for introducing the notion of a [[mathematical structure]], an idea related to the broader, interdisciplinary concept of [[structuralism]].{{sfn|Aczel|pp=129-148}}{{sfn|Aubin|p=314}}{{sfn|Mashaal|pp=70-85}}  Bourbaki's work informed the [[New Math]], a trend in elementary math education during the 1960s.  Although the group remains active, its influence is considered to have declined due to infrequent publication of new volumes of the ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments''.  However the collective's most recent publication appeared in 2016, treating [[algebraic topology]].\n\n==Background==\n\n[[File:Portrait Bourbaki.JPG|thumb|left|200px|[[Charles-Denis Bourbaki]], 19th century general and namesake of the collective]]\n\nCharles-Denis Sauter Bourbaki was born on 22 April 1816 in [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]], France, to a family of Greek origin.  He became a successful general during the era of [[Napoleon III]], serving in the [[Crimean War]] and other conflicts.  During the [[Franco-Prussian war]] however, Charles-Denis Bourbaki suffered a major defeat.  At the time of the [[siege of Metz (1870)|Siege of Metz]], he was lured to Britain on false pretenses of a peace conference, and upon return to the continent he was tasked with lifting the [[Siege of Belfort]], an effort which failed.  Charles-Denis Bourbaki was forced to retreat with his army\u2014the [[Arm\u00e9e de l'Est]]\u2014across the Swiss border.  The force was disarmed by the Swiss, and the general unsuccessfully attempted suicide.  Charles-Denis Bourbaki later died on 27 September 1897, and the dramatic story of his defeat entered the French consciousness.{{sfn|Aczel|pp=61-63}}{{sfn|Mashaal|pp=22-25}}\n\n[[File:Gustav_Herglotz,_Gaston_Julia.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|[[Gaston Julia]] (right), who was not a member of Bourbaki, lost his nose during World War I.  The war created a lost generation of mathematical knowledge, which the Bourbaki founders sought to fill.]]  In the early 20th century, the First World War affected Europeans of all professions and social classes, including mathematicians and male students who fought and died in the front.  For example, the French mathematician [[Gaston Julia]], a pioneer in the study of [[fractal]]s, lost his nose during the war and wore a leather strap over the affected part of his face for the rest of his life.  The deaths of ENS students resulted in a [[lost generation]] in the French mathematical community;{{sfn|Borel|p=373}} the estimated proportion of ENS mathematics students (and French students generally) who died in the war ranges from one-quarter to one-half, depending on the intervals of time (circa 1900-1918, especially 1910-1916) and populations considered.{{sfn|Aczel|p=82}}{{sfn|Mashaal|pp=44-45}} Furthermore, Bourbaki founder Andr\u00e9 Weil remarked in his memoir ''Apprenticeship of a Mathematician'' that France and Germany took different approaches with their intellegentsia during the war: while Germany protected its young students and scientists, France instead committed them to the front, owing to the French [[Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9|culture]] of [[egalitarianism]].{{sfn|Mashaal|pp=44-45}}\n\nA succeeding generation of mathematics students attended the ENS during the 1920s, including Weil and others, the future founders of Bourbaki.  During his time as a student, Weil recalled a prank in which an upperclassman, [[:fr:Raoul Husson|Raoul Husson]]<small>[[:fr:Wikip\u00e9dia:Accueil_principal|[fr]]]</small>, posed as a professor and gave a math lecture, ending with a prompt: \"Theorem of Bourbaki: you are to prove the following...\".  Weil was also aware of a similar stunt in which a student claimed to be from the fictional, impoverished nation of \"Poldevia\" and soliticed the public for donations.{{sfn|Aczel|pp=63-65}}{{sfn|Mashaal|p=23}}  Weil had strong interests in languages and [[Indian culture]], having learned [[Sanskrit]] and read the [[Bhagavad Gita]].{{sfn|Aczel|pp=25-26}}{{sfn|Mashaal|pp=35-37}}  After graduating from the ENS and obtaining his doctorate, Weil took a teaching stint at the [[Aligarh Muslim University]] in India.  While there, Weil met the mathematician [[Damodar Dharmananda Kosambi|Damodar Kosambi]], who was engaged in a power struggle with one of his colleagues.  Weil suggested that Kosambi write an article with material attributed to one \"Bourbaki\", in order to show off his knowledge to the colleague.{{sfn|Beaulieu|1999|p=239}}  Kosambi took the suggestion, attributing the material discussed in the article to \"the little-known Russian mathematician '''D.

However, Weil and Vijayaraghavan respected one another.  Rather than play any role in the drama, Vijayaraghavan instead resigned, later informing Weil of the plan.{{sfn|Aczel|pp=32-34}}  Weil returned to Europe to seek another teaching position.

Eveline remarried to Andr\u00e9 Weil in 1937, and de Possel left the Bourbaki collective some time later.  This sequence of events has caused speculation that de Possel left the group because of the remarriage,{{sfn|Mashaal|p=17}} however this suggestion has also been criticized as possibly historically inaccurate, since de Possel is supposed to have remained active in Bourbaki for years after Andr\u00e9's marriage to Eveline.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.neverendingbooks.org/the-bumpy-road-to-the-first-bourbaki-congress |title=The Bumpy Road to the First Bourbaki Congress |date=22 October 2009 |website=neverendingbooks.org}}</ref>\n\n===World War II===\n\nBourbaki's work slowed significantly during the [[Second World War]], though the group survived and later flourished.  Some members of Bourbaki were Jewish, and therefore obliged to flee from certain parts of Europe at certain times. Weil, who was Jewish, spent the summer of 1939 in Finland with his wife Eveline, as guests of [[Lars Ahlfors]].  Due to their travel near the border, the couple were suspected as Soviet spies by Finnish authorities near the onset of the [[Winter War]], and Andr\u00e9 was later arrested.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.icmihistory.unito.it/portrait/nevanlinna.php |title=Rolf Nevanlinna |website=icmihistory.unito.it}}</ref>  According to an anecdote, Weil was to have been executed but for the passing mention of his case to [[Rolf Nevanlinna]], who asked that Weil's sentence be commuted.{{sfn|Aczel|pp=17-36}}  However, the accuracy of this detail is dubious.<ref>[[Osmo Pekonen]]: ''L'affaire Weil \u00e0 Helsinki en 1939'', Gazette des math\u00e9maticiens 52 (avril 1992), pp. 13\u201420. With an afterword by Andr\u00e9 Weil.</ref>  Weil reached the United States in 1941, later taking another teaching stint in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] from 1945-47 before settling at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1947-1958 and finally the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton]], where he spent the remainder of his career.  Although Weil remained in touch with the Bourbaki collective and visited Europe and the group periodically following the war, his level of involvement with Bourbaki never returned to that at the time of founding.\n\nSecond-generation Bourbaki member [[Laurent Schwartz]] was also Jewish and found pickup work as a math teacher in rural [[Vichy France]].  Moving from village to village, Schwartz planned his movements in order to evade capture by the [[Nazi]]s.{{sfn|Senechal|pp=22-28}}  On one occasion Schwartz found himself trapped overnight in a certain village, as his expected transportation home was unavailable.  There were two inns in town: a comfortable, well-appointed one, and a very poor one with no heating and bad beds.  Schwartz's instinct told him to stay at the poor inn; overnight, the Nazis raided the good inn, leaving the poor inn unchecked.{{sfn|Aczel|p=40}}\n\nMeanwhile Jean Delsarte, a Catholic, was mobilized in 1939 as the captain of an audio reconnaissance battery.  He was forced to lead the unit's retreat from the northeastern part of France toward the south.  While passing near the Swiss border, Delsarte overheard a soldier say \"We are the army of Bourbaki\";{{sfn|Aczel|p=98}}{{sfn|Mashaal|pp=20-24}} the 19th century general's retreat was known to the French.  Delsarte had coincidentally led a retreat similar to that of the collective's namesake.\n\n===Postwar until the present===\n\n{{multiple image\n|align=left\n|direction=vertical\n|width=140\n|image1=Commutative diagram for morphism.svg\n|image2=Venn A intersect B.svg\n|caption2=[[Alexander Grothendieck]] proposed that Bourbaki revise its foundational basis in terms of [[category theory]] as opposed to [[set theory]]; the proposal was not adopted\n}}\n\nFollowing the war, Bourbaki had solidified the plan of its work, and settled into a productive routine.  Bourbaki regularly published volumes of the ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments'' during the 1950s and 1960s, and enjoyed its greatest influence during this period.{{sfn|Aczel|p=117}}{{sfn|Beaulieu|1999|p=237}}  Over time the founding members gradually left the group, slowly being replaced with younger newcomers including [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] and [[Alexander Grothendieck]].  Serre, Grothendieck and Laurent Schwartz were awarded the [[Fields Medal]] during the postwar period, in 1954, 1966 and 1950 respectively.  Later members [[Alain Connes]] and [[Jean-Christophe Yoccoz]] also received the Fields Medal, in 1982 and 1994 respectively.{{sfn|Mashaal|p=19}}\n\nThe later practice of accepting scientific awards contrasted with some of the founders' views.{{sfn|Guedj|p=19}}  During the 1930s, Weil and Delsarte petitioned against a French national scientific \"medal system\" proposed by the [[Nobel prize|Nobel]] [[Nobel Prize in Physics|physics]] laureate [[Jean Perrin]].  Weil and Delsarte felt that the institution of such a system would increase unconstructive pettiness and jealousy in the scientific community.{{sfn|Mashaal|p=49}}  Despite this, the Bourbaki group had previously successfully petitioned Perrin for a government [[Grant (money)|grant]] to support its normal operations.{{sfn|Mashaal|pp=14-16}}  Like the founders, Grothendieck was also averse to awards, albeit for [[pacifism|pacifist]] reasons.  Although Grothendieck was awarded the Fields Medal in 1966, he declined to attend the ceremony in Moscow, in protest of the Soviet government.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.icm2018.org/wp/2018/08/03/sir-michael-atiyah-shares-memory-of-fields-win/ |title=Sir Michael Atiyah shares memory of Fields win |date=3 August 2018 |publisher=[[International Congress of Mathematicians]]}}</ref>  In 1988, Grothendieck rejected the [[Crafoord Prize]] outright, citing no personal need to accept prize money, lack of recent relevant output, and general distrust of the scientific community.<ref name=\"crafoord\">{{cite web |url=http://www.math.columbia.edu/~lipyan/CrafoordPrize.pdf |last=Grothendieck |first=Alexander |title=Crafoord Prize letter, English translation |accessdate=2005-06-17 |url-status = bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060106062005/http://www.math.columbia.edu/~lipyan/CrafoordPrize.pdf |archivedate=6 January 2006 |df=dmy}}</ref>\n\nBorn to Jewish [[anarchist]] parentage, Grothendieck survived the [[Holocaust]] and advanced rapidly in the French mathematical community, despite poor education during the war.{{sfn|Aczel|pp=9-10}}  Grothendieck's teachers included Bourbaki's founders, and so he joined the group.  During Grothendieck's membership, Bourbaki reached an impasse concerning its foundational approach.  Grothendieck advocated for a reformulation of the group's work using [[category theory]] as its theoretical basis, as opposed to set theory.  The proposal was ultimately rejected{{sfn|Aubin|p=328}}{{sfn|Beaulieu|1999|pp=236-237}}{{sfn|Corry|2009|pp=38-51}} in part because the group had already committed itself to a rigid track of sequential presentation, with multiple already-published volumes.  Following this, Grothendieck left Bourbaki \"in anger\".<ref name=\"numericana\" />{{sfn|Senechal|pp=22-28}}{{sfn|Aczel|p=119}}  Biographers of the collective have described Bourbaki's unwillingness to start over in terms of category theory as a missed opportunity.{{sfn|Senechal|pp=22-28}}{{sfn|Aczel|p=205}}{{sfn|Mashaal|pp=81-84}}\n\nDuring the founding period, the group chose the Parisian publisher [[\u00c9ditions Hermann|Hermann]] to issue installments of the ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments''.  Hermann was led by Enrique Freymann, a friend of the founders willing to publish the group's project, despite financial risk.  During the 1970s, Bourbaki entered a protracted legal battle with Hermann over matters of copyright and [[royalty payment]].  Although the Bourbaki group won the suit and retained collective copyright of the ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments'', the dispute slowed the group's productivity.{{sfn|Aczel|pp=205-206}}{{sfn|Mashaal|pp=7, 51-54}}  Former member Pierre Cartier described the lawsuit as a [[pyrrhic victory]], saying: \"As usual in legal battles, both parties lost and the lawyer got rich.\"{{sfn|Senechal|pp=22-28}}  Later editions of the ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments'' were published by [[Masson (publisher)|Masson]], and modern editions are published by [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]].<ref>[https://www.springer.com/series/47 Elements of Mathematics] series in Springer</ref>  From the 1980s through the 2000s, Bourbaki published very infrequently, with the result that in 1998 ''[[Le Monde]]'' pronounced the collective \"dead\".{{sfn|Mashaal|p=146}}  However, in the 2010s Bourbaki resumed publication of the ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments'' with a revised chapter on algebra and a new book on algebraic topology.\n\n==Working method==\n\n[[File:Finite coxeter.svg|thumb|right|400px|At [[Armand Borel]]'s urging, Bourbaki's treatment of Lie groups and Lie algebras included uncharacteristic illustrations, such as graphs of finite [[Coxeter systems]]<ref name=\"lie\">{{cite book |last=Bourbaki |first=Nicolas |title=Lie Groups and Lie Algebras, Chapters 4-6 |publisher=Springer |date=2002 |isbn=9783540691716 |pages=205\u2013206}}</ref>]]\n\nBourbaki holds periodic conferences for the purpose of expanding the ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments''; these conferences are the central activity of the group's working life.  Subcommittees are assigned to write drafts on specific material, and the drafts are later presented, vigorously debated and re-drafted at the conferences.  Unanimous agreement is required before any material is deemed acceptable for publication.{{sfn|Aczel|p=92}}{{sfn|Borel|p=375}}{{sfn|Guedj|p=18}}  A given piece of material may require six or more drafts over a period of several years, and some drafts are never developed into completed work.{{sfn|Borel|p=375}}{{sfn|Guedj|p=20}}  Bourbaki's writing process has therefore been described as \"[[Sisyphus|Sisyphean]]\".{{sfn|Guedj|p=18}}  Although the method is slow, it yields a final product which satisfies the group's standards for [[mathematical rigour]], one of Bourbaki's main priorities in the treatise.  Bourbaki's emphasis on rigour was a reaction to the style of [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]], who stressed the importance of free-flowing mathematical [[intuition]] at the cost of thorough presentation.{{efn|\"Bourbaki came to terms with Poincar\u00e9 only after a long struggle. When I joined the group in the fifties it was not the fashion to value Poincar\u00e9 at all. He was old-fashioned.\" \u2014Pierre Cartier{{sfn|Senechal|pp=22-28}} }}  During the project's early years, Dieudonn\u00e9 served as the group's scribe, authoring several final drafts which were ultimately published.  For this purpose, Dieudonn\u00e9 adopted an impersonal [[writing style]] which was not his own, but which was used to craft material acceptable to the entire group.{{sfn|Aczel|p=116}}{{sfn|Borel|p=376}}  Dieudonn\u00e9 reserved his personal style for his own work; like all members of Bourbaki, Dieudonn\u00e9 also published material under his own name,{{sfn|Mashaal|p=69}} including the nine-volume ''[[Treatise on analysis|\u00c9l\u00e9ments d'analyse]]'', a work explicitly focused on analysis and of a piece with Bourbaki's initial intentions.  \n\nMost of the final drafts of Bourbaki's ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments'' carefully avoided using illustrations, favoring a formal presentation based only in text and formulas.  An exception to this was the treatment of Lie groups and Lie algebras (especially in chapters 4-6), which did make use of diagrams and illustrations.  The inclusion of illustration in this part of the work was due to [[Armand Borel]].  Borel was minority-Swiss in a majority-French collective, and [[Self-deprecation|self-deprecated]] as \"the Swiss peasant\", explaining that [[visual learning]] was important to the Swiss national character.{{sfn|Senechal|pp=22-28}}{{sfn|Aczel|pp=111-112}}  When asked about the dearth of illustration in the work, former member [[Pierre Cartier]] replied:\n\n{{quote|text=The Bourbaki were [[Puritan]]s, and Puritans are strongly opposed to pictorial representations of truths of their faith.

And you know that the [[Protestantism in France|French Protestant]]s especially are very close to Jews in spirit. |title=Pierre Cartier{{sfn|Senechal|pp=22-28}} }}\n\nThe conferences have historically been held at quiet rural areas.{{sfn|Beaulieu|1999|pp=225-226}}  These locations contrast with the lively, sometimes heated debates which have occurred.  Laurent Schwartz reported an episode in which Weil slapped Cartan on the head with a draft.  The hotel's proprietor saw the incident and assumed that the group would split up, but according to Schwartz, \"peace was restored within ten minutes.\"{{sfn|Mashaal|pp=112-113}}  The historical, confrontational style of debate within Bourbaki has been partly attributed to Weil, who believed that new ideas have a better chance of being born in confrontation than in an orderly discussion.{{sfn|Borel|p=375}}{{sfn|Mashaal|pp=112-113}}  Schwartz related another illustrative incident: Dieudonn\u00e9 was adamant that [[topological vector spaces]] must appear in the work before [[Integral|integration]], and whenever anyone suggested that the order be reversed, he would loudly threaten his resignation. This became an in-joke among the group; [[Roger Godement|Roger Godement's]] wife Sonia attended a conference, aware of the idea, and asked for proof. As Sonia arrived at a meeting, a member suggested that integration must appear before topological vector spaces, which triggered Dieudonn\u00e9's usual reaction.{{sfn|Mashaal|pp=112-113}}  \n\nDespite the historical culture of heated argument, Bourbaki thrived during the middle of the twentieth century.

For example, in 1939 the group released a wedding announcement for the marriage of \"Betti Bourbaki\" (daughter of Nicolas) to one \"[[Hoist with his own petard|H. P\u00e9tard]]\" (H. \"Firecrackers\" or \"Hector P\u00e9tard\"), a \"lion hunter\".{{sfn|Beaulieu|1999|pp=239-240}}  Hector P\u00e9tard was itself a pseudonym, but not one originally coined by the Bourbaki members.  The P\u00e9tard moniker was originated by [[Ralph P. Boas]], [[Frank Smithies]] and other [[Princeton]] mathematicians who were aware of the Bourbaki project; inspired by them, the Princeton mathematicians published an article on the \"mathematics of lion hunting\".  After meeting Boas and Smithies, Weil composed the wedding announcement which contained several mathematical puns.{{sfn|Mashaal|pp=30, 113-114}}  Bourbaki's internal newsletter ''La Tribu'' has sometimes been issued with humorous subtitles to describe a given conference, such as \"The Extraordinary Congress of Old Fogies\" (where anyone older than 30 was considered a fogy) or \"The Congress of the Motorization of the Trotting Ass\" (an expression used to describe the routine unfolding of a mathematical proof, or process).{{sfn|Beaulieu|1999|p=226}}{{sfn|Mashaal|pp=110-111}}\n\nDuring the 1940s-1950s,{{sfn|Beaulieu|1999|p=241}}{{sfn|Mashaal|pp=33-34}} the [[American Mathematical Society]] received applications for individual membership from Bourbaki.  They were rebuffed by [[John Robert Kline|J.R. Kline]] who understood the entity to be a collective, inviting them to re-apply for institutional membership at a higher rate.  In response, Bourbaki floated a rumor that Ralph Boas was not a real person, but a collective pseudonym of the editors of ''[[Mathematical Reviews]]'' with which Boas had been affiliated.  The reason for targeting Boas was because he had known the group in its earlier days when they were less strict with secrecy, and he'd described them as a collective in an article for the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]''.{{sfn|Aczel|pp=121-123}}  In November 1968, a mock obituary of Nicolas Bourbaki was released during one of the seminars.{{sfn|Beaulieu|1999|pp=241-242}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.neverendingbooks.org/according-to-groth-iv-22 |title=According to Groth.

The textbook series ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments de math\u00e9matique'' ''(Elements of mathematics)'' is the group's central work.  The [[S\u00e9minaire Bourbaki]] is a lecture series held regularly under the group's auspices, and the talks given are also published as lecture notes.  Journal articles have been published with authorship attributed to Bourbaki, and the group publishes an internal newsletter ''La Tribu'' (''The Tribe'') which is distributed to current and former members.<ref name=\"archiver\">{{cite web |url=http://archives-bourbaki.ahp-numerique.fr/elements-mathematique |title=\u00c9l\u00e9ments de Math\u00e9matique |website=Archives Bourbaki}}</ref>{{sfn|Mashaal|pp=108-109}}\n\n===''\u00c9l\u00e9ments de math\u00e9matique''===\n{{main|\u00c9l\u00e9ments de math\u00e9matique}}\n\nThe content of the ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments'' is divided into ''books''\u2014major topics of discussion, ''volumes''\u2014individual, physical books, and ''chapters'', together with certain summaries of results, historical notes, and other details.  The volumes of the ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments'' have had a complex publication history.  Material has been revised for new editions, published chronologically out of order of its intended logical sequence, grouped together and partitioned differently in later volumes, and translated into English.  For example, the second book on ''[[Abstract algebra|Algebra]]'' was originally released in eight French volumes: the first in 1942 being chapter 1 alone, and the last in 1980 being chapter 10 alone.  This presentation was later condensed into five volumes with chapters 1-3 in the first volume, chapters 4-7 in the second, and chapters 8-10 each remaining the third through fifth volumes of that portion of the work.<ref name=\"archiver\" />  The English edition of Bourbaki's ''Algebra'' consists of translations of the two volumes on chapters 1-3 and 4-7, with chapters 8-10 unavailable in English as of {{year}}.\n\nWhen Bourbaki's founders began working on the ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments'', they originally conceived of it as a \"treatise on analysis\", the proposed work having a working title of the same name (''Trait\u00e9 d'analyse'').  The opening part was to comprehensively deal with the [[foundations of mathematics]] prior to analysis, and was referred to as the \"Abstract Packet\".  Over time, the members developed this proposed \"opening section\" of the work to the point that it would instead run for several volumes and comprise a major part of the work, covering set theory, abstract algebra, and topology.  Once the project's scope expanded far beyond its original purpose, the working title ''Trait\u00e9 d'analyse'' was dropped in favor of ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments de math\u00e9matique''.{{sfn|Mashaal|p=11}}  The unusual, singular \"Mathematic\" was meant to connote Bourbaki's belief in the unity of mathematics.{{sfn|Aczel|pp=99-100}}{{sfn|Borel|p=374}}{{sfn|Mashaal|p=55}}\n\nThe volumes of the ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments'' published by Hermann were indexed by chronology of publication and referred to as ''[[wikt:fascicule|fascicules]]'': installments in a large work.  Some volumes did not consist of the normal definitions, proofs and exercises in a math textbook, but contained only summaries of results for a given topic, stated without proof.  These volumes were referred to as ''Fascicules de r\u00e9sultats'', with the result that ''fascicule'' may refer to a volume of Hermann's edition, or to one of the \"summary\" sections of the work (e.g. ''Fascicules de r\u00e9sultats'' is translated as \"Summary of Results\" rather than \"Installment of Results\", referring to the content rather than a specific volume).{{efn|The [[History of mathematics|mathematical historian]] [[Leo Corry]] also observed that the phrase \"Summary of Results\" is a misleading one for a distinct reason, instead referring to the content of the ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments'' rather than the publication history of its volumes.{{sfn|Corry|1992|p=326}}{{sfn|Corry|2004|p=320}} }}  The first volume of Bourbaki's ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments'' to be published was the Summary of Results in ''[[Set Theory]]'', in 1939.{{sfn|Senechal|pp=22-28}}<ref name=\"archiver\" />{{sfn|Mashaal|p=52}}  Similarly one of the work's later books, ''[[Differentiable manifold|Differential]] and [[Analytic manifold|Analytic Manifold]]s'', consisted only of two volumes of summaries of results, with no chapters of content having been published.\n\nLater installments of the ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments'' appeared infrequently during the 1980s and 1990s.  A volume of ''[[Commutative Algebra]]'' (chapters 8-9) was published in 1983, and no other volumes were issued until the appearance of the same book's tenth chapter in 1998.  During the 2010s, Bourbaki increased its productivity.  A re-written and expanded version of the eighth chapter of ''Algebra'' appeared in 2012, a new book treating ''[[Algebraic Topology]]'' was published in 2016, and a revised edition of ''[[Spectral theory|Spectral Theory]]'' was issued in 2019.\n\n[[File:Bourbaki, Theorie des ensembles maitrier.jpg|thumb|First book of the ''[[\u00c9l\u00e9ments de math\u00e9matique]]'', 1970 edition]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|+''\u00c9l\u00e9ments de math\u00e9matique''<ref name=\"archiver\" />{{efn|Years refer to the date of publication of each book's first volume, which also contains its first proper chapter.

''La Tribu'' usually lists the members present at a conference, together with any visitors, family members or other friends in attendance.

Its first generation was that of the founding fathers, those who created the group in 1934: Weil, Cartan, Chevalley, Delsarte, de Possel, and Dieudonn\u00e9.  Others joined the group, and others left its ranks, so that some years later there were about twelve members, and that number remained roughly constant.  Laurent Schwartz was the only mathematician to join Bourbaki during the war, so his is considered an intermediate generation.  After the war, a number of members joined: [[Jean-Pierre Serre]], [[Pierre Samuel]], [[Jean-Louis Koszul]], [[Jacques Dixmier]], [[Roger Godement]], and [[Samuel Eilenberg|Sammy Eilenberg]].  These people constituted the second generation of Bourbaki.  In the 1950s, the third generation of mathematicians joined Bourbaki.  These people included [[Alexandre Grothendieck]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Bruhat]], [[Serge Lang]], the American mathematician [[John Tate]], [[Pierre Cartier (mathematician)|Pierre Cartier]], and the Swiss mathematician [[Armand Borel]].{{sfn|Senechal|pp=22-28}}{{sfn|Aczel|pp=108-109}} }}\n\nAfter the first three generations there were roughly twenty later members, not including current participants.  Bourbaki has a custom of keeping its current membership secret, a practice meant to ensure that its output is presented as a collective, unified effort under the Bourbaki pseudonym, not attributable to any one author (e.g. for purposes of copyright or royalty payment).  This secrecy is also intended to deter unwanted attention which could disrupt normal operations.

Bourbaki provided a simple and relatively precise definition of concepts and structures, which philosophers and social scientists believed was fundamental within their disciplines and in bridges among different areas of knowledge.  Despite the superficial nature of these links, the various schools of structuralist thinking, including Bourbaki, were able to support each other.

However Atiyah identified Mashaal's book as the better of the two and criticized Aczel's book, writing: \"I was not convinced of the total reliability of its (Aczel's) sources, nor of its philosophical credentials.\"  Atiyah also wrote that the collaboration between Weil and L\u00e9vi-Strauss was a \"slightly tenuous link\" which Aczel used to make \"grand\" claims on the scale of Bourbaki's interdisciplinary influence.<ref name=\"Atiyah\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ams.org/notices/200709/tx070901150p.pdf |title=Book Review: Bourbaki, A Secret Society of Mathematicians and The Artist and the Mathematician, Reviewed by Michael Atiyah |last=Atiyah |first=Michael |publisher=American Mathematical Society |website=ams.org}}</ref>}}{{efn|In a 2011 letter to the ''Mathematical Intelligencer'', the mathematician [[:de:Jean-Michel Kantor|Jean-Michel Kantor]]<small>[[:de:Wikipedia:Hauptseite|[de]]]</small> was harshly critical of the notion that Bourbaki's mathematical structures had anything to do with the structuralism of the humanities, rejecting the connections made by Aczel in 2006.<ref name=\"Kantor\">{{cite journal |last=Kantor |first=Jean-Michel |title=Bourbaki's Structures and Structuralism |journal=Mathematical Intelligencer |volume=33 |issue=1 |page=1 |date=2011 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/251293966 |doi=10.1007/s00283-010-9173-4 |doi-access=free }}</ref>  Kantor observed that the two versions of structuralism had developed independently of one another, and that L\u00e9vi-Strauss' conception of structure had derived from the [[Prague linguistic circle|Prague circle]] of linguistics, not from Bourbaki.  On the other hand, Aczel had already acknowledged the linguistic origins of the structuralism of the humanities.{{sfn|Aczel|pp=149-159}}  In 1997 David Aubin had pre-emptively moderated both extremes, observing that the two schools of thought had distinct origins, but also had certain interactions and \"common features\".  Aubin also cited L\u00e9vi-Strauss to show that the latter had reached certain conclusions in anthropology independently of Weil's mathematical help, although Weil's help provided confirmation of L\u00e9vi-Strauss' conclusions.{{sfn|Aubin|p=311}}  This undermined Aczel's argument that mathematics and Bourbaki played an important role in the development of structuralism in the humanities, although Aubin also stressed that the two schools had some collaboration.}} }}\n\nThe impact of \"structuralism\" on mathematics itself was also criticized.  The mathematical historian Leo Corry argued that Bourbaki's use of mathematical structures was  unimportant within the ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments'', having been established in ''Theory of Sets'' and cited infrequently afterwards.<ref name=\"Corry1992\">{{cite journal |last=Corry |first=Leo |author-link=Leo Corry |title=Nicolas Bourbaki and the concept of Mathematical Structure |url=https://www.tau.ac.il/~corry/publications/articles/bourbaki-structures-synthese.html |journal=Synthese |volume=92 |issue=3 |pages=328-332 |date=September 1992 |doi=10.1007/BF00414286 |ref=harv }}</ref><ref name=\"Corry2001\">{{cite book |last=Corry |first=Leo |title=Changing Images in Mathematics: From the French Revolution to the New Millennium |chapter=Mathematical Structures from Hilbert to Bourbaki: The Evolution of an Image of Mathematics |editor-last1=Bottazzini |editor-first1=Umberto |editor-last2=Dalmedico |editor-first2=Amy Dahan |url=https://www.tau.ac.il/~corry/publications/articles/images-structures.html |publisher=Routledge |pages=1-3, 17-18 |date=2001 |ISBN=9780415868273 |ref=harv }}</ref>{{sfn|Corry|2004|p=338}}{{sfn|Corry|2009|pp=25-31}}  Corry described the \"structural\" view of mathematics promoted by Bourbaki as an \"image of knowledge\"\u2014a conception about a scientific discipline\u2014as opposed to an item in the discipline's \"body of knowledge\", which refers to the actual scientific results in the discipline itself.<ref name=\"Corry2001\" />\n\nBourbaki also had some influence in the arts.  The literary collective [[Oulipo]] was founded on 24 November 1960 under circumstances similar to Bourbaki's founding, with the members initially meeting in a restaurant.  Although several members of Oulipo were mathematicians, the group's purpose was to create [[experimental literature]] by playing with language.  Oulipo frequently employed mathematically-based [[constrained writing]] techniques, such as the [[Oulipo#Constraints|S+7 method]].  Oulipo member [[Raymond Queneau]] attended a Bourbaki conference in 1962.{{sfn|Mashaal|p=73}}{{sfn|Aczel|pp=173-182}}  In 2018, the American musical duo [[Twenty One Pilots]] released a [[concept album]] named ''[[Trench (album)|Trench]]''.  The album's conceptual framework was the mythical city of \"Dema\" ruled by nine \"bishops\"; one of the bishops was named \"Nico\", short for Nicolas Bourbaki.  Following the album's release, there was a spike in internet searches for \"Nicolas Bourbaki\".<ref name=\"numericana\" />{{efn|Similarly, Bourbaki created nicknames for its members.  Jean Delsarte was referred to as \"bishop\", which may have been a reference to his Catholicism.{{sfn|Mashaal|p=111}} }}\n\n===Praise===\n\nBourbaki's work has been praised by some mathematicians.  In a book review, [[Emil Artin]] described the ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments'' in broad, positive terms:\n\n{{quote|Our time is witnessing the creation of a monumental work: an exposition of the whole of present day mathematics. Moreover this exposition is done in such a way that the common bond between the various branches of mathematics become clearly visible, that the framework which supports the whole structure is not apt to become obsolete in a very short time, and that it can easily absorb new ideas.|Emil Artin<ref name=\"Artin\" /> }}\n\nAmong the volumes of the ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments'', Bourbaki's work on Lie Groups and Lie Algebras has been identified as \"excellent\",<ref name=\"Atiyah\" /> having become a standard reference on the topic.  In particular, former member Armand Borel described the volume with chapters 4-6 as \"one of the most successful books by Bourbaki\".{{sfn|Borel|p=379}}  The success of this part of the work has been attributed to the fact that the books were composed while leading experts on the topic were Bourbaki members.{{sfn|Senechal|pp=22-28}}{{sfn|Aczel|p=111}}\n\n[[Jean-Pierre Bourguignon]] expressed appreciation for the S\u00e9minaire Bourbaki, saying that he'd learned a large amount of material at its lectures, and referred to its printed lecture notes regularly.{{sfn|Mashaal|p=102}}  He also praised the ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments'' for containing \"some superb and very clever proofs\".{{sfn|Mashaal|pp=54-55}}\n\n===Criticism===\n\nBourbaki has also been criticized by several mathematicians\u2014including its own former members\u2014for a variety of reasons.  Criticisms have included the choice of presentation of certain topics within the ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments'' at the expense of others,{{efn|This specific point has itself been criticized.  It has been observed that it is unfair to criticize a work on a given topic for not dealing with other topics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.math.nsc.ru/LBRT/g2/english/ssk/euclid.html |title=Apology of Euclid |author-link=Sem\u00ebn Samsonovich Kutateladze |last=Kutateladze |first=Sem\u00ebn Samsonovich }}</ref>{{sfn|Mashaal|pp=116-118}} }} dislike of the method of presentation for given topics, dislike of the group's working style, and a perceived [[Elitism|elitist]] mentality around Bourbaki's project and its books, especially during the collective's most productive years in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nBourbaki's deliberations on the ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments'' resulted in the inclusion of some topics, while others were not treated. When asked in a 1997 interview about topics left out of the ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments'', former member Pierre Cartier replied:\n\n{{quote|text=There is essentially no analysis beyond the foundations: nothing about [[partial differential equations]], nothing about [[probability]]. There is also nothing about [[combinatorics]], nothing about [[algebraic topology]],{{efn|Bourbaki has since published a book on algebraic topology.}} nothing about concrete [[geometry]]. And Bourbaki never seriously considered [[mathematical logic|logic]]. Dieudonn\u00e9 himself was very vocal against logic.  Anything connected with [[mathematical physics]] is totally absent from Bourbaki's text.|title=Pierre Cartier{{sfn|Senechal|pp=22-28}} }}\n\nAlthough Bourbaki had resolved to treat mathematics from its foundations, the group's eventual solution in terms of set theory was attended by several problems.  Bourbaki's members were mathematicians as opposed to [[logician]]s, and therefore the collective had a limited interest in [[mathematical logic]].{{sfn|Guedj|p=20}}  As Bourbaki's members themselves said of the book on set theory, it was written \"with pain and without pleasure, but we had to do it.\"{{sfn|Mashaal|p=121}}  Dieudonn\u00e9 personally remarked elsewhere that ninety-five percent of mathematicians \"don't care a fig\" for mathematical logic.{{sfn|Mashaal|p=120}}  In response, logician Adrian Mathias harshly criticized Bourbaki's foundational framework, noting that it did not take [[G\u00f6del]]'s results into account.{{sfn|Mashaal|pp=120-123}}<ref name=\"Mathias\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~ardm/bourbaki.pdf|title=The Ignorance of Bourbaki|last=Mathias|first=Adrian|date=August 22, 1990|website=dpmms.cam.ac.uk}}</ref>\n\nBourbaki also influenced the New Math, a failed{{sfn|Mashaal|p=135}} reform in Western mathematics education at the elementary and secondary levels, which stressed abstraction over concrete examples.  During the mid-20th century, reform in basic math education was spurred by a perceived need to create a mathematically literate workforce for the modern economy, and also to compete with the [[Soviet Union]].  In France, this led to the Lichnerowicz Commission of 1967, headed by [[Andr\u00e9 Lichnerowicz]] and including some (then-current and former) Bourbaki members.  Although Bourbaki members had previously (and individually) reformed math instruction at the university level, they had less direct involvement with implementation of the New Math at the primary and secondary levels.  New Math reforms resulted in instructional material which was incomprehensible to both students and teachers, failing to meet the [[Cognition|cognitive]] needs of younger students.  The attempted reform was harshly criticized by Dieudonn\u00e9 and also by brief founding Bourbaki participant Jean Leray.{{sfn|Mashaal|pp=134-145}}\n\n[[File:Benoit_Mandelbrot_mg_1804c.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Benoit Mandelbrot]] was among Bourbaki's critics]]\n\nDieudonn\u00e9 later regretted that Bourbaki's success had contributed to a [[Snob|snobbery]] for pure mathematics in France, at the expense of [[applied mathematics]].  In an interview, he said: \"It is possible to say that there was no serious applied mathematics in France for forty years after Poincar\u00e9.  There was even a snobbery for pure math.  When one noticed a talented student, one would tell him 'You should do pure math.'  On the other hand, one would advise a mediocre student to do applied math while thinking, \"It's all that he can do! ... The truth is actually the reverse.  You can't do good work in applied math until you can do good work in pure math.\"{{sfn|Mashaal|pp=118-119}}  Claude Chevalley confirmed an elitist culture within Bourbaki, describing it as \"an absolute certainty of our superiority over other mathematicians.\"{{sfn|Guedj|p=20}}  Alexander Grothendieck also confirmed an elitist mentality within Bourbaki.{{sfn|Corry|2009|pp=38-51}}  Some mathematicians, especially geometers and applied mathematicians, found Bourbaki's influence to be stifling.{{sfn|Aubin|p=313}}  Benoit Mandelbrot's decision to emigrate to the United States in 1958 was motivated in part by a desire to escape Bourbaki's influence in France.{{sfn|Mashaal|p=130}}\n\nSeveral related criticisms of the ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments'' have concerned its target audience and the intent of its presentation.  Volumes of the ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments'' begin with a note to the reader which says that the series \"takes up mathematics at the beginning, and gives complete proofs\" and that \"the method of exposition we have chosen is axiomatic and abstract, and normally proceeds from the general to the particular.\"<ref>''Theory of Sets'', p. v.</ref>  Despite the opening language, Bourbaki's intended audience are not absolute beginners in mathematics, but rather undergraduates, graduate students, and professors who are familiar with mathematical concepts.{{sfn|Mashaal|p=54}}  Claude Chevalley said that the ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments'' are \"useless for a beginner\",{{sfn|Guedj|p=22}} and Pierre Cartier clarified that \"The misunderstanding was that it should be a textbook for everybody.  That was the big disaster.\"{{sfn|Senechal|pp=22-28}}  \n\nThe work is divided into two halves.  While the first half treats established subjects, the second half deals with modern research areas like commutative algebra and spectral theory.  This divide in the work is related to a historical change in the intent of the treatise.  The ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments' '' content consists of theorems, proofs, exercises and related commentary, common material in math textbooks.  Despite this presentation, the first half was not written as [[original research]] but rather as a reorganized presentation of established knowledge.  In this sense, the ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments' '' first half was more akin to an [[encyclopedia]] than a textbook series.  As Cartier remarked, \"The misunderstanding was that many people thought it should be ''taught'' the way it was written in the books.  You can think of the first books of Bourbaki as an encyclopedia of mathematics... If you consider it as a textbook, it's a disaster.\"{{sfn|Senechal|pp=22-28}}  \n\nThe strict, ordered presentation of material in the ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments' '' first half was meant to form the basis for any further additions.  However, developments in modern mathematical research have proven difficult to adapt in terms of Bourbaki's organizational scheme.  This difficulty has been attributed to the fluid, dynamic nature of ongoing research which, being new, is not settled or fully understood.<ref name=\"Atiyah\" />{{sfn|Borel|pp=377-379}}  Bourbaki's style has been described as a particular scientific [[paradigm]] which has been superseded in a [[paradigm shift]].  For example, [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]] cited [[Vaughan Jones|Vaughan Jones']] novel work in [[knot theory]] as an example of topology which was done without dependence on Bourbaki's system.<ref name=\"Stewart\">{{Cite journal |last=Stewart |first=Ian |title=Bye-Bye Bourbaki: Paradigm Shifts in Mathematics |journal=The Mathematical Gazette |date=November 1995 |volume=79 |pages=496\u2013498 |publisher=[[The Mathematical Association]] |doi=10.2307/3618076 |issue=486 |jstor=3618076}}</ref>  Bourbaki's influence has declined over time;<ref name=\"Stewart\" /> this decline has been partly attributed to the absence of certain modern topics\u2014such as category theory\u2014from the treatise.{{sfn|Aczel|p=205}}{{sfn|Mashaal|pp=81-84}}\n\nAlthough multiple criticisms have pointed to shortcomings in the collective's project, one has also pointed to its strength: Bourbaki was a \"victim of its own success\"<ref name=\"Atiyah\" /> in the sense that it accomplished what it set out to do, achieving its original goal of presenting a thorough treatise on modern mathematics.{{sfn|Aczel|pp=204-205}}{{sfn|Aubin|p=329}}{{sfn|Borel|p=377}}  These factors prompted biographer Maurice Mashaal to conclude his treatment of Bourbaki in the following terms:\n\n{{quote|text=Such an enterprise deserves admiration for its breadth, for its enthusiasm and selflessness, for its strongly collective character.

{"title_page": "Holistic nursing", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{More footnotes|date=February 2020}}\n{{Format|date=February 2020}}\n}}\n'''Holistic nursing''' is a [[nursing]] speciality concerning the integration of one's mind, body, and spirit with his or her environment. This speciality has a theoretical basis in a few [[Nursing theory|grand nursing theories]], most notably the [[science of unitary human beings]], as published by [[Martha E. Rogers]]<nowiki/> in ''[[An Introduction to the Theoretical Basis of Nursing]]'', and the mid-range theory [[Empowered Holistic Nursing Education]], as published by Dr. Katie Love. Holistic nursing has gained recognition by the American Nurses Association (ANA) as a nursing specialty with a defined scope of practice and standards. Holistic nursing focuses on the mind, body, and spirit working together as a whole and how spiritual awareness in nursing can help heal illness. [[Alternative medicine#Holistic medicine|Holistic medicine]]<nowiki/> focuses on maintaining optimum well-being and preventing rather than just treating disease.\n\n== Core values ==\n\n=== The Holistic philosophy: theory and ethics ===\nHolistic nursing is based on the fundamental theories of nursing, such as the works of [[Florence Nightingale]] and [[Jean Watson]] as well as alternative theories of world connectedness, wholeness, and healing. Holistic nurses respect the patient as the decision-maker throughout the continuum of care. The holistic nurse and patient relationship is based on a partnership in which the holistic nurse engages the patient in treatment options and healthcare choices. The holistic nurse seeks to establish a professional and ethical relationship with the patient in order to preserve the patient's sense of dignity, wholesomeness, and inner worth.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PVsdAAAAQBAJ&pg=PR5&dq=holistic+nursing+approach#v=onepage&q=holistic%20nursing%20approach&f=false|title=Holistic Nursing|last=Dossey|first=Barbara Montgomery|last2=Keegan|first2=Lynn|date=2012-03-08|publisher=Jones & Bartlett Publishers|isbn=9781449645649|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Mariano|first=Carla|date=2007-06-01|title=Holistic Nursing as a Specialty: Holistic Nursing\u2014Scope and Standards of Practice|journal=Nursing Clinics of North America|language=en|volume=42|issue=2|pages=165\u2013188|doi=10.1016/j.cnur.2007.03.008|pmid=17544677|issn=0029-6465}}</ref>\n\n=== Holistic caring process ===\nHolistic nursing combines standard nursing interventions with various modalities that are focused on treating the patient in totality. Alternative therapies can include stress management, aroma therapy, and therapeutic touch. The combination of interventions allows the patient to heal in mind, body, and spirit by focusing on the patient's emotions, spirituality, and cultural identity as much as the illness. The six steps of the holistic caring process occur simultaneously, including assessment, diagnosis, outcomes, therapeutic plan of care, implementation, and evaluation. The holistic assessment of the patient can include spiritual, transpersonal, and energy-field assessments in combination with the standard physical and emotional assessments. The therapeutic plan of care in holistic nursing includes a highly individualized and unique plan for each patient.

This speciality has a theoretical basis in a few [[Nursing theory|grand nursing theories]], most notably the [[science of unitary human beings]], as published by [[Martha E. Rogers]]<nowiki/> in ''[[An Introduction to the Theoretical Basis of Nursing]]'', and the mid-range theory [[Empowered Holistic Nursing Education]], as published by Dr. Katie Love. Holistic nursing has gained recognition by the American Nurses Association (ANA) as a nursing specialty with a defined scope of practice and standards. Holistic nursing focuses on the mind, body, and spirit working together as a whole and how spiritual awareness in nursing can help heal illness. [[Alternative medicine#Holistic medicine|Holistic medicine]]<nowiki/> focuses on maintaining optimum well-being and preventing rather than just treating disease.\n\n== Core values ==\n\n=== The Holistic philosophy: theory and ethics ===\nHolistic nursing is based on the fundamental theories of nursing, such as the works of [[Florence Nightingale]] and [[Jean Watson]] as well as alternative theories of world connectedness, wholeness, and healing. Holistic nurses respect the patient as the decision-maker throughout the continuum of care. The holistic nurse and patient relationship is based on a partnership in which the holistic nurse engages the patient in treatment options and healthcare choices. The holistic nurse seeks to establish a professional and ethical relationship with the patient in order to preserve the patient's sense of dignity, wholesomeness, and inner worth.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PVsdAAAAQBAJ&pg=PR5&dq=holistic+nursing+approach#v=onepage&q=holistic%20nursing%20approach&f=false|title=Holistic Nursing|last=Dossey|first=Barbara Montgomery|last2=Keegan|first2=Lynn|date=2012-03-08|publisher=Jones & Bartlett Publishers|isbn=9781449645649|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Mariano|first=Carla|date=2007-06-01|title=Holistic Nursing as a Specialty: Holistic Nursing\u2014Scope and Standards of Practice|journal=Nursing Clinics of North America|language=en|volume=42|issue=2|pages=165\u2013188|doi=10.1016/j.cnur.2007.03.008|pmid=17544677|issn=0029-6465}}</ref>\n\n=== Holistic caring process ===\nHolistic nursing combines standard nursing interventions with various modalities that are focused on treating the patient in totality. Alternative therapies can include stress management, aroma therapy, and therapeutic touch. The combination of interventions allows the patient to heal in mind, body, and spirit by focusing on the patient's emotions, spirituality, and cultural identity as much as the illness. The six steps of the holistic caring process occur simultaneously, including assessment, diagnosis, outcomes, therapeutic plan of care, implementation, and evaluation. The holistic assessment of the patient can include spiritual, transpersonal, and energy-field assessments in combination with the standard physical and emotional assessments. The therapeutic plan of care in holistic nursing includes a highly individualized and unique plan for each patient. Holistic nurses recognize that the plan of care will change based on the individual patient, and therefore embrace healing as a process that is always changing and adapting to the individual's personal healing journey.

While restricting Sedum to Sedeae simplifies the infrafamilial structure of the genus, its species remain distributed within both clades of this tribe.{{sfn|Nikulin et al|2016}}{{sfn|Gallo|2017}}{{sfn|Gallo|2017a}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|20}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n\n=== Books ===\n\n* {{cite book|editor-last=Eggli|editor-first=Urs|title=Illustrated Handbook of Succulent Plants: Crassulaceae|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nU7mCAAAQBAJ|date= 2003|publisher=[[Springer Science & Business Media]]|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-55874-0|isbn=978-3-642-55874-0|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Thiede |first1=J |last2=Eggli |first2=U|editor-last=Kubitzki |editor-first=Klaus|editor-link=Klaus Kubitzki |title=Berberidopsidales, Buxales, Crossosomatales, Fabales p.p., Geraniales, Gunnerales, Myrtales p.p., Proteales, Saxifragales, Vitales, Zygophyllales, Clusiaceae Alliance, Passifloraceae Alliance, Dilleniaceae, Huaceae, Picramniaceae, Sabiaceae |year=2007 |chapter=Crassulaceae|pages=83\u2013119|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PdSL7jBNX9EC |isbn=978-3540322146|ref=harv}} ''([https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227205999_Crassulaceae full text at]'' [[Research Gate]])\n\n=== Articles ===\n\n* {{cite journal |last1=Carrillo-Reyes |first1=Pablo |last2=Sosa |first2=Victoria |last3=Mort |first3=Mark E. |title=Molecular phylogeny of the Acre clade (Crassulaceae): Dealing with the lack of definitions for Echeveria and Sedum |journal=[[Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution]] |date=October 2009 |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=267\u2013276 |doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2009.05.022|pmid=19482091 |url=http://www.crassulaceae.com/crassulaceae.com/botanik/pflanzen/scans/gnr1630/1340-5.pdf|ref={{harvid|Carillo-Reyes et al|2009}}}}\n* {{cite journal |last1=Gallo |first1=Lorenzo |title=Towards a review of the genus ''Petrosedum'' (Crassulaceae): Taxonomic and nomenclatural notes on Iberian taxa |journal=Webbia |date=24 August 2017a |volume=72 |issue=2 |pages=207\u2013216 |doi=10.1080/00837792.2017.1363978|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal |last1=Gallo |first1=Lorenzo |title=Nomenclatural novelties in Petrosedum (Crassulaceae) |journal=[[Phytotaxa]] |date=9 May 2017 |volume=306 |issue=2 |pages=169 |doi=10.11646/phytotaxa.306.2.8|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal |last1=Gontcharova |first1=S.

The event received negative reviews from critics. Arnold Furious of 411mania gave the event a score of 4.5 out of 10, writing \"A show was a lot of potential but both the good matches were riddled with needless interference. [[Vince Russo]]\u2019s style of booking just couldn\u2019t produce great matches. He didn\u2019t have the attention span to book it and assumed the crowd didn\u2019t have an interest in watching it. Despite all of the truly great matches in wrestling being given, more often than not, at least 20 minutes and little/zero interference. Especially when you\u2019ve got two great wrestlers who are super over like Bret & Benoit and you still book a shitload of interference. You can\u2019t have the crowd being hot and having something new happening every few seconds. You\u2019ll burn out the audience and no one will remember half the shit that happens. It\u2019s a lesson Vince Russo still hasn\u2019t learnt to this very day. Wrestling fans DO have attention spans. Especially on PPV.\"<ref name=\"411mania-1\"/>\n\nKevin Pantoja panned the event giving 3 out of 10 stars and considering it a bad event, with \"A lot of late WCW is terrible, but this might have been the most frustrating show. There was potential in a few matches (all three tournament matches and the Revolution tag) but all of them disappointed. Part of it was on the performers and part of it was on the Russo booking. Too many run-ins, too much overbooking and too many meaningless backstage segments. Seriously, the Meng/Luger, Sid/Goldberg, Hennig/Buff and Vampiro/Berlyn matches were all horrible, while the Kimberly/David Flair stuff still managed to be the lowlight.\"<ref name=\"411mania-2\"/>\n\nScott Keith stated that the event \"had a really hot opener and a pretty decent main event, but there was just nothing of substance to fill the other 2 \u0405 hours in between. You could probably stretch and say the six-person was okay, but the lows were just too depressing and the highs weren\u2019t high enough to save it. Early buyrates for this show already are disappointing to WCW, which shouldn\u2019t be a surprise considering how piss-poor the promotion for it was.\"<ref name=\"411mania-3\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nOn the November 22 episode of ''Monday Nitro'', Bret Hart considered to defend the WCW World Heavyweight Championship against [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]] at [[Starrcade (1999)|Starrcade]]. In the warmup to the event, Hart and Goldberg defeated [[Harris Brothers|Creative Control]] to win the [[WCW World Tag Team Championship]] on the December 7 episode of ''Thunder'', only to lose it to [[The Outsiders (professional wrestling)|The Outsiders]], six days later on ''Nitro''. At Starrcade, Hart controversially defeated Goldberg to retain the title in a [[Professional wrestling match types#No Disqualification match|no disqualification match]] when [[Roddy Piper]] ended the match while Hart had applied a [[Sharpshooter (professional wrestling)|Sharpshooter]] on Goldberg without Goldberg ever submitting.\n\n==Results==\n{{Pro Wrestling results table\n|results=<ref

The event received negative reviews from critics. Arnold Furious of 411mania gave the event a score of 4.5 out of 10, writing \"A show was a lot of potential but both the good matches were riddled with needless interference. [[Vince Russo]]\u2019s style of booking just couldn\u2019t produce great matches. He didn\u2019t have the attention span to book it and assumed the crowd didn\u2019t have an interest in watching it. Despite all of the truly great matches in wrestling being given, more often than not, at least 20 minutes and little/zero interference. Especially when you\u2019ve got two great wrestlers who are super over like Bret & Benoit and you still book a shitload of interference. You can\u2019t have the crowd being hot and having something new happening every few seconds. You\u2019ll burn out the audience and no one will remember half the shit that happens. It\u2019s a lesson Vince Russo still hasn\u2019t learnt to this very day. Wrestling fans DO have attention spans. Especially on PPV.\"<ref name=\"411mania-1\"/>\n\nKevin Pantoja panned the event giving 3 out of 10 stars and considering it a bad event, with \"A lot of late WCW is terrible, but this might have been the most frustrating show. There was potential in a few matches (all three tournament matches and the Revolution tag) but all of them disappointed. Part of it was on the performers and part of it was on the Russo booking. Too many run-ins, too much overbooking and too many meaningless backstage segments. Seriously, the Meng/Luger, Sid/Goldberg, Hennig/Buff and Vampiro/Berlyn matches were all horrible, while the Kimberly/David Flair stuff still managed to be the lowlight.\"<ref name=\"411mania-2\"/>\n\nScott Keith stated that the event \"had a really hot opener and a pretty decent main event, but there was just nothing of substance to fill the other 2 \u0405 hours in between. You could probably stretch and say the six-person was okay, but the lows were just too depressing and the highs weren\u2019t high enough to save it. Early buyrates for this show already are disappointing to WCW, which shouldn\u2019t be a surprise considering how piss-poor the promotion for it was.\"<ref name=\"411mania-3\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nOn the November 22 episode of ''Monday Nitro'', Bret Hart considered to defend the WCW World Heavyweight Championship against [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]] at [[Starrcade (1999)|Starrcade]]. In the warmup to the event, Hart and Goldberg defeated [[Harris Brothers|Creative Control]] to win the [[WCW World Tag Team Championship]] on the December 7 episode of ''Thunder'', only to lose it to [[The Outsiders (professional wrestling)|The Outsiders]], six days later on ''Nitro''. At Starrcade, Hart controversially defeated Goldberg to retain the title in a [[Professional wrestling match types#No Disqualification match|no disqualification match]] when [[Roddy Piper]] ended the match while Hart had applied a [[Sharpshooter (professional wrestling)|Sharpshooter]] on Goldberg without Goldberg ever submitting.\n\n==Results==\n{{Pro Wrestling results table\n|results=<ref

The former, often eponymously known as the \"Krebs cycle\", is the key sequence of metabolic reactions that provides energy in the cells of humans and other [[Aerobic organism|oxygen-respiring organisms]]; and its discovery earned Krebs a [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1953. With [[Hans Kornberg]], he also discovered the [[glyoxylate cycle]], which is a slight variation of the citric acid cycle found in plants, [[bacteria]], [[protists]], and fungi. Krebs died in 1981 in [[Oxford]], where he had spent 13 years of his career from 1954 until his retirement in 1967 at the [[University of Oxford]].\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Early life and education ===\n\nKrebs was born in [[Hildesheim]], Germany, to Georg Krebs, an [[Otolaryngology|ear, nose, and throat]] surgeon, and Alma Krebs (n\u00e9e Davidson). He descended from Jewish-Silesian ancestry and was the middle of three children, older sister Elisabeth and younger brother Wolfgang.\n\nKrebs attended the famous old Gymnasium Andreanum in his home town. Near the end of [[World War I]], in September 1918, six months short of completing his secondary school education, he was [[conscripted]] into the [[Imperial German Army]]. He was allowed to take an emergency examination for his high school diploma, which he passed with such a high score that he suspected the examiners of being \"unduly lenient and sympathetic\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hans|first1=Krebs|last2=Martin|first2=Anne|title=Reminiscences and Reflections|year=1981|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-1985-4702-0|page=14|url=https://books.google.com/?id=27-4AAAAIAAJ}}</ref> With the end of the war two months later, his conscription ended.\n\nKrebs decided to follow his father's profession and entered the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]] in December 1918 to study medicine. In 1919 he transferred to the [[University of Freiburg]]. In 1923 he published his first scientific paper on a [[Histology|tissue staining technique]]. He did this work under the guidance of Wilhelm von Mollendorf starting it in 1920. He completed his medical course in December 1923. To obtain a [[Doctor of Medicine]] degree, and a medical license, he spent one year at the Third Medical Clinic in the [[University of Berlin]]. By then he had turned his professional goal from becoming a practising physician to becoming a medical researcher, particularly in biochemistry. In 1924 he studied at the Department of Chemistry at the Pathological Institute of the Charit\u00e9 Hospital, in [[Berlin]], for training in chemistry and biochemistry. He earned his [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] degree in 1925 from the [[University of Hamburg]].<ref name=rsc>{{cite web|last1=Willcocks|first1=Elizabeth|title=A lucky man|url=http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/Issues/2003/June/luckyman.asp|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|date=1 June 2003}}</ref><ref name=quayle>{{cite journal|last1=Quayle|first1=J.

He was paid a modest 4800 [[Mark (currency)|marks]] per year. After four years in 1930, with 16 publications to his credit, his mentor Warburg urged him to move on and he took up the position of Assistant in the Department of Medicine at the Municipal Hospital in [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]] (now part of [[Hamburg]]). The next year he moved to the Medical Clinic of the [[University of Freiburg]]. At Freiburg he was in charge of about 40 patients, and was at liberty to do his own research. Before a year was over at Freiburg, he, with research student [[Kurt Henseleit]], published their discovery of the ornithine cycle of urea synthesis, which is the metabolic pathway for [[urea]] formation. It is now known as the [[urea cycle]], and is sometimes also referred to as the Krebs\u2013Henseleit cycle. Together they also developed a complex [[aqueous solution]] (a [[Buffer solution|buffer]]), or [[perfusion]] ''ex vivo'', for studying blood flow in arteries, which is now called the Krebs\u2013Henseleit buffer.)<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bailey|first1=Leslie E|last2=Ong|first2=Seok D|title=Krebs\u2013Henseleit solution as a physiological buffer in perfused and superfused preparations|journal=Journal of Pharmacological Methods|year=1978|volume=1|issue=2|pages=171\u2013175|doi=10.1016/0160-5402(78)90022-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Krebs\u2013Henseleit Buffer Modified|url=http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/sigma/k3753?lang=en&region=IN|publisher=Sigma-Aldrich Co.

With the rise of [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s [[Nazi Party]] to power, Germany decreed the [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service]], which decreed the removal of all non-Germans, and anti-Nazis, from professional occupations. Krebs received his official dismissal from his job in April 1933, and his service was terminated on 1 July 1933. An admirer, [[Sir Frederick Gowland Hopkins]] at the [[University of Cambridge]], immediately came to his rescue, and persuaded the university to recruit Krebs to work with him in the Department of Biochemistry.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hans|first1=Krebs|last2=Martin|first2=Anne|title=Reminiscences and Reflections|year=1981|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-1985-4702-0|page=48|url=https://books.google.com/?id=27-4AAAAIAAJ}}</ref> By July 1933 he was settled in Cambridge with financial support from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]].

He worked there for 19 years. University of Sheffield opened a Department of Biochemistry, now Department of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, in 1938 and Krebs became its first Head, and eventually a Professor in 1945. Krebs took over the running of the [[Sorby Research Institute]] in 1943.  In 1944, the British [[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)|Medical Research Council]] established the MRC Unit for Cell Metabolism Research at Sheffield, and Krebs was appointed the Director. With this his laboratory became so large that the locals jokingly nicknamed it \"Krebs's Empire\". He moved with his MRC unit to the [[University of Oxford]] in 1954 as [[Whitley Professor of Biochemistry]], the post he held till his retirement in 1967. The editorial board of ''[[Biochemical Journal]]'' extended their good wishes on his retirement, but in return he promised to keep them busy, by producing scientific papers. He continued his research, and took his MRC unit to the Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine at the [[Radcliffe Infirmary]], Oxford.

Using his Warburg manometer, he mixed a slice of liver with purified ornithine and citrulline. He found that citrulline acted as a [[catalyst]] in the metabolic reactions of urea from [[ammonia]] and [[carbon dioxide]]. He and Henseleit published their discovery in 1932. Thus the [[urea cycle]] (or \"ornithine cycle\") was established, and it was the first metabolic cycle to be discovered.<ref name=wilson/><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Holmes|first1=FL|title=Hans Krebs and the discovery of the ornithine cycle|journal=Federation Proceedings|year=1980|volume=39|issue=2|pages=216\u201325|pmid=6986292}}</ref>\n\n=== Citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle) ===\nAt the University of Sheffield, Krebs and William Johnson investigated cellular respiration by which oxygen was consumed to produce energy from the breakdown of [[glucose]]. Krebs had earlier suggested to Warburg while they worked together in Germany that by using a [[manometer]] it could be possible to detect the oxygen consumption and identify the chemical reaction in [[glucose metabolism]]. Warburg had flatly rejected the idea. In Sheffield Krebs vigorously worked to identify a possible chemical reaction and came up with numerous hypothetical pathways. Using the manometer he tested those hypotheses one by one. One hypothesis involving [[succinate]], [[fumarate]], and [[malate]] proved to be useful because all these molecules increased oxygen consumption in the pigeon breast muscle. In 1937 German biochemists Franz Koop and Carl Martinus had demonstrated a series of reactions using [[citrate]] that produced [[oxaloacetate]]. Krebs realised that these molecules could be the missing intermediates for such reaction. After four months of experimental works to fill in the gaps, Krebs and Johnson succeeded in establishing the sequence of the chemical cycle, which they called the \"[[citric acid cycle]]\".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Krebs|first1=HA|last2=Johnson|first2=WA|title=Metabolism of ketonic acids in animal tissues.|journal=The Biochemical Journal|year=1937|volume=31|issue=4|pages=645\u201360|pmid=16746382|pmc=1266984|doi=10.1042/bj0310645}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Krebs|first1=HA|last2=Johnson|first2=WA|title=Acetopyruvic acid (alphagamma-diketovaleric acid) as an intermediate metabolite in animal tissues|journal=The Biochemical Journal|year=1937|volume=31|issue=5|pages=772\u20139|pmid=16746397|pmc=1267003|doi=10.1042/bj0310772}}</ref> It is also known as the \"Krebs cycle\" or \"tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle\".\n\nKrebs sent a short manuscript account of the discovery to ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' on 10 June 1937.

With [[Hans Kornberg]], he also discovered the [[glyoxylate cycle]], which is a slight variation of the citric acid cycle found in plants, [[bacteria]], [[protists]], and fungi. Krebs died in 1981 in [[Oxford]], where he had spent 13 years of his career from 1954 until his retirement in 1967 at the [[University of Oxford]].\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Early life and education ===\n\nKrebs was born in [[Hildesheim]], Germany, to Georg Krebs, an [[Otolaryngology|ear, nose, and throat]] surgeon, and Alma Krebs (n\u00e9e Davidson). He descended from Jewish-Silesian ancestry and was the middle of three children, older sister Elisabeth and younger brother Wolfgang.\n\nKrebs attended the famous old Gymnasium Andreanum in his home town. Near the end of [[World War I]], in September 1918, six months short of completing his secondary school education, he was [[conscripted]] into the [[Imperial German Army]]. He was allowed to take an emergency examination for his high school diploma, which he passed with such a high score that he suspected the examiners of being \"unduly lenient and sympathetic\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hans|first1=Krebs|last2=Martin|first2=Anne|title=Reminiscences and Reflections|year=1981|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-1985-4702-0|page=14|url=https://books.google.com/?id=27-4AAAAIAAJ}}</ref> With the end of the war two months later, his conscription ended.\n\nKrebs decided to follow his father's profession and entered the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]] in December 1918 to study medicine. In 1919 he transferred to the [[University of Freiburg]]. In 1923 he published his first scientific paper on a [[Histology|tissue staining technique]]. He did this work under the guidance of Wilhelm von Mollendorf starting it in 1920. He completed his medical course in December 1923. To obtain a [[Doctor of Medicine]] degree, and a medical license, he spent one year at the Third Medical Clinic in the [[University of Berlin]]. By then he had turned his professional goal from becoming a practising physician to becoming a medical researcher, particularly in biochemistry. In 1924 he studied at the Department of Chemistry at the Pathological Institute of the Charit\u00e9 Hospital, in [[Berlin]], for training in chemistry and biochemistry. He earned his [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] degree in 1925 from the [[University of Hamburg]].<ref name=rsc>{{cite web|last1=Willcocks|first1=Elizabeth|title=A lucky man|url=http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/Issues/2003/June/luckyman.asp|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|date=1 June 2003}}</ref><ref name=quayle>{{cite journal|last1=Quayle|first1=J.

He was paid a modest 4800 [[Mark (currency)|marks]] per year. After four years in 1930, with 16 publications to his credit, his mentor Warburg urged him to move on and he took up the position of Assistant in the Department of Medicine at the Municipal Hospital in [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]] (now part of [[Hamburg]]). The next year he moved to the Medical Clinic of the [[University of Freiburg]]. At Freiburg he was in charge of about 40 patients, and was at liberty to do his own research. Before a year was over at Freiburg, he, with research student [[Kurt Henseleit]], published their discovery of the ornithine cycle of urea synthesis, which is the metabolic pathway for [[urea]] formation. It is now known as the [[urea cycle]], and is sometimes also referred to as the Krebs\u2013Henseleit cycle. Together they also developed a complex [[aqueous solution]] (a [[Buffer solution|buffer]]), or [[perfusion]] ''ex vivo'', for studying blood flow in arteries, which is now called the Krebs\u2013Henseleit buffer.)<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bailey|first1=Leslie E|last2=Ong|first2=Seok D|title=Krebs\u2013Henseleit solution as a physiological buffer in perfused and superfused preparations|journal=Journal of Pharmacological Methods|year=1978|volume=1|issue=2|pages=171\u2013175|doi=10.1016/0160-5402(78)90022-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Krebs\u2013Henseleit Buffer Modified|url=http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/sigma/k3753?lang=en&region=IN|publisher=Sigma-Aldrich Co.

With the rise of [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s [[Nazi Party]] to power, Germany decreed the [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service]], which decreed the removal of all non-Germans, and anti-Nazis, from professional occupations. Krebs received his official dismissal from his job in April 1933, and his service was terminated on 1 July 1933. An admirer, [[Sir Frederick Gowland Hopkins]] at the [[University of Cambridge]], immediately came to his rescue, and persuaded the university to recruit Krebs to work with him in the Department of Biochemistry.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hans|first1=Krebs|last2=Martin|first2=Anne|title=Reminiscences and Reflections|year=1981|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-1985-4702-0|page=48|url=https://books.google.com/?id=27-4AAAAIAAJ}}</ref> By July 1933 he was settled in Cambridge with financial support from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]]. Although Germany restricted him to bringing only his personal belongings, he was fortunate that the government agents allowed him to take his equipment and research samples to England. They proved to be pivotal to his later discoveries, especially the [[manometer]] developed by Warburg specifically for the measurement of oxygen consumption in thin slices of tissues; it was the basis for his research.<ref name=wilson>{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=B.

He worked there for 19 years. University of Sheffield opened a Department of Biochemistry, now Department of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, in 1938 and Krebs became its first Head, and eventually a Professor in 1945. Krebs took over the running of the [[Sorby Research Institute]] in 1943.  In 1944, the British [[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)|Medical Research Council]] established the MRC Unit for Cell Metabolism Research at Sheffield, and Krebs was appointed the Director. With this his laboratory became so large that the locals jokingly nicknamed it \"Krebs's Empire\". He moved with his MRC unit to the [[University of Oxford]] in 1954 as [[Whitley Professor of Biochemistry]], the post he held till his retirement in 1967. The editorial board of ''[[Biochemical Journal]]'' extended their good wishes on his retirement, but in return he promised to keep them busy, by producing scientific papers. He continued his research, and took his MRC unit to the Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine at the [[Radcliffe Infirmary]], Oxford.

He found that citrulline acted as a [[catalyst]] in the metabolic reactions of urea from [[ammonia]] and [[carbon dioxide]]. He and Henseleit published their discovery in 1932. Thus the [[urea cycle]] (or \"ornithine cycle\") was established, and it was the first metabolic cycle to be discovered.<ref name=wilson/><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Holmes|first1=FL|title=Hans Krebs and the discovery of the ornithine cycle|journal=Federation Proceedings|year=1980|volume=39|issue=2|pages=216\u201325|pmid=6986292}}</ref>\n\n=== Citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle) ===\nAt the University of Sheffield, Krebs and William Johnson investigated cellular respiration by which oxygen was consumed to produce energy from the breakdown of [[glucose]]. Krebs had earlier suggested to Warburg while they worked together in Germany that by using a [[manometer]] it could be possible to detect the oxygen consumption and identify the chemical reaction in [[glucose metabolism]]. Warburg had flatly rejected the idea. In Sheffield Krebs vigorously worked to identify a possible chemical reaction and came up with numerous hypothetical pathways. Using the manometer he tested those hypotheses one by one. One hypothesis involving [[succinate]], [[fumarate]], and [[malate]] proved to be useful because all these molecules increased oxygen consumption in the pigeon breast muscle. In 1937 German biochemists Franz Koop and Carl Martinus had demonstrated a series of reactions using [[citrate]] that produced [[oxaloacetate]]. Krebs realised that these molecules could be the missing intermediates for such reaction.
