It is also sometimes used in derived meanings.\n\nThe female version of Malik is '''Malikah''' ({{lang-ar|[[wikt:\u0645\u0644\u0643\u0629#Arabic|\u0645\u0644\u0643\u0629]]}}) (or its various spellings such as '''[[wikt:\u0645\u0644\u06a9\u0647#Persian|Malekeh]]''' or '''Melike'''), meaning \"queen\".\n\nThe name Malik was originally found among various pre-Arab and non-Muslim Semitic peoples such as the indigenous ethnic [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] of [[Iraq]], [[Amorites]], [[Jews]], [[Arameans]], [[Mandeans]], [[Assyrian people|Syriacs]], and pre-Islamic [[Arabs]]. It has since been spread among various predominantly Muslim and non-Semitic peoples in [[Central Asia]], the [[Middle East]], and [[South Asia]]. Malik is also an [[angel]] in the [[Quran]], who never smiled since the day the hellfire was created.\n\nThe last name \"Malik\" or the accented version \"Mal\u00edk\" may also be of [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] origin, most predominantly [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Czech language|Czech]], and [[Slovakian language|Slovakian]], as it comes from a Polish word \"ma\u0142y\" meaning \"small\".

Malik is also used for tribal leaders, e.g. among the [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]].\n\nSome [[Arab]] kingdoms are currently ruled by a Malik:\n* [[Bahrain]], formerly under a ''[[Hakim (title)|hakim]]'', or \"ruler\", until 16 August 1971, then under an ''[[emir]]'', or \"prince\", and since 14 February 2002 under a ''malik''.\n* [[Jordan]], formerly the [[Emirate]] of [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]];\n* [[Morocco]], formerly a [[Sultanate]];\n* [[Tunisia]], formerly ruled by maliks (1 year), title still borne by descendants of the [[royal family]];\n* [[Saudi Arabia]]. On 10 June 1916 the [[Grand Sharif]] of [[Mecca]] assumed the title of King of the [[Hejaz]]; from 29 October 1916 \"King of the Arabs and [[Commander of the Faithful]]\"; from 6 November 1916 recognized by the allied powers only as King of the [[Hejaz]], [[Commander of the Faithful]], [[Grand Sharif]] and [[emir]] of Mecca; also assumed the title of [[Caliph]] on 11 March 1924; from 3 October 1924: King of the Hejaz and Grand Sharif of Mecca. In 1925 [[Nejd]] conquered Hijaz, so the Sultan of Nejd added the title \"King of Hijaz\".

Frequently also used as part of a lady's name, e.g. ''Malika-i-Jahan'' 'Queen of the World'.\n*''[[Sahib]] us-Sumuw al-Malik'' (female Sahibat us-Sumuw al-Malik) is an Arabic title for His/Her [[Royal Highness]], notably for Princes in the dynasty of the Malik of Egypt.\n\nThe following components are frequently part of titles, notably in Persian (also used elsewhere, e.g. in India's Moghol tradition):\n*'''- ul-Mulk''' (or '''ul-Molk'''): - of the kingdom; e.g. Malik Usman Khan, who served the [[Sultan]] of [[Gujarat]] as Governor of [[Lahore]], received the title of ''Zubdat ul-Mulk'' 'best of the kingdom' as a hereditary distinction, which was retained as part of the style of his heirs, the ruling [[Diwan (title)|Diwan]]s (only since 1910 promoted to [[Nawab]]) of [[Palanpur]].\n*'''- ul-Mamaluk''' (plural of ''ul-mulk''): - of the kingdoms.\n\nIn the great Indian Muslim [[salute state]] of [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]], a first rank- vassal of the Mughal [[padshah]] (emperor) imitating his lofty Persian court protocol, the word '''Molk''' became on itself one of the titles used for ennobled Muslim retainers of the ruling [[Nizam of Hyderabad|Nizam]]'s court, in fact the third in rank, only below [[Jah]] (the highest) and [[Umara]], but above [[Al-Dawla|Daula]], [[Khan (title)|Jang]], [[Nawab]], [[Khan (title)|Khan Bahadur]] and [[Khan (title)|Khan]]; for the Nizam's Hindu retainers different titles were used, the equivalent of Molk being Vant.\n\n==<ref name=\":0\" />Usage in South Asia==\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}\n{{further|Kakazai|Malik (Punjab)|Malik (Bihar)|Malik (Jat)|Malik  (Gujarat)}}\n\n=== Pashtun usage===\nThe Arabic term came to be adopted as a  term for \"[[tribal chieftain]]\" in [[Afghanistan]] and the [[tribe|tribal]] areas of [[Pakistan]], especially among [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]], for a [[Tribal chief|tribal leader]] or a chieftain. In tribal Pashtun society the Maliks serve as ''de facto'' arbiters in local conflicts, interlocutors in state policy-making, tax-collectors, heads of village and town councils and delegates to provincial and national ''jirgas'' as well as to Parliament.\nMalik is a common surname among  every Pashtun family leader to solve the problem at the time of conflict with another family.\n\n===Punjabi usage===\nIn the [[Punjab region|Punjab]], \"Malik\", literally meaning \"King\" is a title used by some well-reputed specific Punjabi aristocrat bloodlines with special lineage, more formally known as [[Zamindar]]s. The Actual clan to hold and originate this esteemed title is the Malik-Awan clan which is also associated with different aspects throughout different generations and periods of history, It is believed that they originated as a clan of warriors who later on settled as wealthy landlords. The Malik-Awan clan holds significant historical importance & are considered as royalty among the Punjabi caste system. They are well known for their way of life as well as their martial traditions. war customs and tribal status. The Malik-Awan Clan ranks among the Chief Clans of the [[Awan (tribe)|Awan]] Tribe, residing predominantly in northern, central, and western parts of Pakistani Punjab. As per historical interpretations the [[Awan (tribe)|Awan]] tribe traces its bloodline to a well known Arab Conqueror [[Sayyed]] [[Qutb Shah]]  ibn Ya\u2018l\u0101, al-Gilani, Who is also a recognized descendant of the [[fourth caliph]] [[Ali]] ibn Abi Talib. Throughout Historical Imprints and due to Martial Culture of the Malik-Awan clan, they are well known for being one of the brute forces of Punjab alongside [[Niazi]]'s & [[Jat people|Jatt]]'s. Malik-Awan Clan is one of the clans in light of history who has stood Sword to Sword with some of the most dominant forces of their time namely [[Mughal Empire]], [[Afghan Durrani Empire]], [[Sikh Empire]] & [[British Empire]].\n\n===General usage===\nMalik or Malek is a common element in first and family names, usually without any aristocratic meaning, However Malik is a large community and a well known clan of the [[Awan (Pakistan)|Awan]] tribe in [[Pakistan]] with [[Arab]] heritage.\n\nSome Maliks (Urdu: \u0645\u0644\u06a9) are also a clan of [[Hindu]] [[Jat]], [[Muslim Jat|Muslim]] and a few [[Sikh Jat|Sikh Jatt]], found primarily in India. (There also exist Hindu [[Punjabi Maliks]] that are part of the [[Khukhrain]] or [[Arora]] communities. The Muslim Malik  community is settled all over Pakistan and the Sikh Malik in India. The Malik are also known as the Ghatwala. The Gathwala are now designating themselves as Maliks. Due to popularity of the Malik title many punjabi sub-casts such as [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]] [[Punjabi people|Punjabis]], [[Teli]] [[Punjabi people|Punjabis]] and many others have adapted the title to gain acceptance in the [[Punjab]]i caste system.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nHowever, the above is just apocryphal and indigenous derivations can't be ruled out e.g. from the [[Malla_(Ancient_India)|Mallas]], the [[Malla Kingdom]] or the Sanskrit word [[Malla-yuddha|''{{IAST|malla}}'']] (meaning, wrestling) or its derivative [[malakhra]] (\u092e\u0932\u094d\u0932-\u0915\u094d\u0930\u0940\u0921\u093c\u093e, malla-kreeda).\n\n==List of notable name-bearers==\n===First name===\n\n* [[Malik Ata Muhammad Khan]], Current Cheiftan of Malik-Awan Clan, A Renowned feudal lords and states man \n* [[Nawab Malik Amir Mohammad Khan]], Nawab of Kalabagh, Patriarch of Malik-Awan Tribe\n* [[Malik Bendjelloul]], Swedish Academy Award-winning documentary filmmaker, journalist, and child actor\n* [[Malik ibn Anas]], known as Imam Malik, one of the greatest [[Sunni Muslim]] scholars after whom the [[Maliki]] school of [[fiqh]] was named\n* [[Phife_Dawg|Malik Izaak Taylor]] (aka Phife Dawg), American rapper and a member of the group A Tribe Called Quest\n* [[Feroz Khan Noon|Malik Feroz Khan Noon]], former Prime Minister of Pakistan\n* [[Malik Khizar Hayat Tiwana]], Punjab Unionist party Premier of the Punjab\n* [[Malik Khoshaba]], an [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] tribal leader of the Tyareh tribe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tyareh.org/leaders--heroes.html|title=Leaders & Heroes|website=My Site}}</ref>\n* [[Malik Peiris]], Sri Lankan scientist\n* [[Malik Riaz]], Pakistani businessman and a real estate investor who owns [[Bahria Town]].\n* [[Malik Shabazz]], also known as Malcolm X, an American Muslim leader and human rights activist\n* [[Malik Yoba]], American actor and occasional singer.\n\n===Surname===\n* [[Abdul Malik (physician)|Abdul Malik]], Brigadier (rtd.), first Pakistani cardiologist, founder of [[National Heart Foundation (Bangladesh)|National Heart Foundation]]\n* [[Anas ibn Malik]], a companion of [[Muhammad]].\n* [[Anu Malik]], Indian singer and music director\n* [[Armaan Malik]], Indian singer\n* [[Art Malik]], a Pakistani-born British actor\n* [[Nikunj Malik]], Indian actress<ref>[http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-10-301025-Malik-Riaz-can-help-lift-Pakistan-sports-Saeed-Hai \"Malik Riaz can help lift Pakistan sports: Saeed Hai\"], [[The News International]], Karachi, 15 February 2015.

As well as Stratford, the district also includes the towns of [[Alcester]], [[Southam]], and [[Shipston-on-Stour]], and the large villages of [[Studley, Warwickshire|Studley]] and [[Wellesbourne]].\n\nThe district was formed on 1 April 1974 by the merger of the [[borough]] of Stratford-upon-Avon, [[Alcester Rural District]], [[Shipston-on-Stour Rural District]], [[Southam Rural District]] and a majority of [[Stratford-upon-Avon Rural District]].\n\n==Education==\nIn the state sector, children start school in the school year (1 September to 31 August) in which they turn five. They stay at primary school for seven years until they are eleven.  As part of Warwickshire, Stratford-on-Avon still maintains the [[grammar school]] system. In the final year of [[primary school]], children are given the opportunity of sitting the [[eleven plus exam]] in order to compete for a place at one of the grammar schools.\n\nThe grammar schools in the district are [[King Edward VI School, Stratford-upon-Avon|King Edward VI]], [[Stratford-upon-Avon Grammar School for Girls]] and [[Alcester Grammar]].\n\nThe area gets the best [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSE]] results overall in Warwickshire.\n\n==Politics==\n{{update-section|date=June 2019}}\n{{see also|Stratford-on-Avon local elections}}\nElections to the district council are held in three out of every four years, with one third of the 53 seats on the council being elected at each election. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative party]] has controlled the council for most of the time since the first election in 1973, and recently has had a majority since the [[2003 Stratford-on-Avon Council election|2003 election]]. As a result of the [[2010 Stratford-on-Avon Council election|last election in 2010]] the Conservatives had 30 [[councillor]]s, compared to 20 [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] and 3

As well as Stratford, the district also includes the towns of [[Alcester]], [[Southam]], and [[Shipston-on-Stour]], and the large villages of [[Studley, Warwickshire|Studley]] and [[Wellesbourne]].\n\nThe district was formed on 1 April 1974 by the merger of the [[borough]] of Stratford-upon-Avon, [[Alcester Rural District]], [[Shipston-on-Stour Rural District]], [[Southam Rural District]] and a majority of [[Stratford-upon-Avon Rural District]].\n\n==Education==\nIn the state sector, children start school in the school year (1 September to 31 August) in which they turn five. They stay at primary school for seven years until they are eleven.  As part of Warwickshire, Stratford-on-Avon still maintains the [[grammar school]] system. In the final year of [[primary school]], children are given the opportunity of sitting the [[eleven plus exam]] in order to compete for a place at one of the grammar schools.\n\nThe grammar schools in the district are [[King Edward VI School, Stratford-upon-Avon|King Edward VI]], [[Stratford-upon-Avon Grammar School for Girls]] and [[Alcester Grammar]].\n\nThe area gets the best [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSE]] results overall in Warwickshire.\n\n==Politics==\n{{update-section|date=June 2019}}\n{{see also|Stratford-on-Avon local elections}}\nElections to the district council are held in three out of every four years, with one third of the 53 seats on the council being elected at each election. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative party]] has controlled the council for most of the time since the first election in 1973, and recently has had a majority since the [[2003 Stratford-on-Avon Council election|2003 election]]. As a result of the [[2010 Stratford-on-Avon Council election|last election in 2010]] the Conservatives had 30 [[councillor]]s, compared to 20 [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] and 3 [[Independent (politician)|independents]].<ref name=\"change\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/council/html/3766.stm|title=Stratford-On-Avon|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|accessdate=3 March 2011|date=19 April 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Parishes and settlements==\nOther than Stratford-upon-Avon the district includes:\n\n*[[Admington]], [[Alcester]], [[Alderminster]], [[Ardens Grafton]], [[Arlescote]], [[Arrow, Warwickshire|Arrow]], [[Aston Cantlow]], [[Atherstone-on-Stour]], [[Avon Dassett]],\n*[[Barcheston and Willington]], [[Barton-on-the-Heath]], [[Bearley]], [[Beaudesert, Warwickshire|Beaudesert]], [[Bidford-on-Avon]], [[Billesley, Warwickshire|Billesley]], [[Binton]], [[Bishops Itchington]], [[Brailes]], [[Broom, Warwickshire|Broom]], [[Burmington]], [[Burton Dassett]], [[Butlers Marston]]\n*[[Chadshunt]], [[Chapel Ascote]], [[Charlecote]], [[Cherington, Warwickshire|Cherington]], [[Chesterton and Kingston]], [[Claverdon]], [[Clifford Chambers and Milcote]], [[Combrook]], [[Compton Verney]], [[Compton Wynyates]], [[Coughton, Alcester|Coughton]]\n*[[Dorsington]]\n*[[Ettington]], [[Exhall]]\n*[[Farnborough, Warwickshire|Farnborough]], [[Fenny Compton]], [[Fulbrook, Warwickshire|Fulbrook]]\n*[[Gaydon]], [[Great Alne]], [[Great Wolford]]\n*[[Halford, Warwickshire|Halford]], [[Hampton Lucy]], [[Harbury]], [[Haselor]], [[Henley-in-Arden]], [[Hodnell and Wills Pastures]], [[Honington, Warwickshire|Honington]]\n*[[Idlicote]], [[Ilmington]]\n*[[Kineton]], [[Kinwarton]]\n*[[Ladbroke, Warwickshire|Ladbroke]], [[Langley, Warwickshire|Langley]], [[Lighthorne]], [[Lighthorne Heath]], [[Little Compton, Warwickshire|Little Compton]], [[Little Wolford]], [[Long Compton]], [[Long Itchington]], [[Long Marston, Warwickshire|Long Marston]], [[Lower Shuckburgh]], [[Loxley, Warwickshire|Loxley]], [[Luddington, Warwickshire|Luddington]]\n*[[Milcote]], [[Moreton Morrell]], [[Morton Bagot]]\n*[[Napton-on-the-Hill]], [[Newbold Pacey]], [[Northend, Warwickshire|Northend]]\n*[[Oldberrow]], [[Oversley Green]], [[Oxhill, Warwickshire|Oxhill]]\n*[[Pillerton Hersey]], [[Pillerton Priors]], [[Preston Bagot]], [[Preston-on-Stour]], [[Priors Hardwick]], [[Priors Marston]]\n*[[Quinton, Warwickshire|Quinton]]\n*[[Radbourne]], [[Radway]], [[Ratley and Upton]]\n*[[Salford Priors]], [[Sambourne]],  [[Shipston-on-Stour]], [[Shotteswell]], [[Snitterfield]], [[Southam]], [[Spernall]], [[Stockton, Warwickshire|Stockton]], [[Stoneton]], [[Stourton, Warwickshire|Stourton]], [[Stratford-upon-Avon]], [[Stretton-on-Fosse]], [[Studley, Warwickshire|Studley]], [[Sutton-under-Brailes]]\n*[[Tanworth-in-Arden]], [[Temple Grafton]], [[Tidmington]], [[Tredington, Warwickshire|Tredington]], [[Tysoe]]\n*[[Ufton]], [[Ullenhall]], [[Upper Shuckburgh]], [[Warmington, Warwickshire|Warmington]], [[Watergall]], [[Weethley]], [[Welford-on-Avon]], [[Wellesbourne]], [[Weston-on-Avon]], [[Whatcote]], [[Whichford]], [[Whitchurch, Warwickshire|Whitchurch]], [[Wilmcote]], [[Wixford]], [[Wolverton, Warwickshire|Wolverton]], [[Wootton Wawen]], [[Wormleighton]]\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of wards in Stratford district by population]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.youtube.com/user/StratfordDC Stratford-on-Avon District Council YouTube channel]\n\n{{Stratford-on-Avon_district}}\n{{Warwickshire}}\n{{West_Midlands}}\n\n{{coord|52.1902|-1.7087|type:adm3rd_region:GB-WAR|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Stratford-On-Avon (District)}}\n[[Category:Stratford-on-Avon District| ]]\n[[Category:Non-metropolitan districts of Warwickshire]]\n", "name_user": "Widefox", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eParishes and settlements:dab link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratford-on-Avon_District"}

The postnominals ''P.A.'' are often added for protonotaries apostolic.

In Britain and countries whose Roman Catholic usage it directly influenced:\n* Archbishop: ''the Most Reverend'' (''Most Rev.''); addressed as ''Your Grace'' rather than ''His Excellency'' or ''Your Excellency''.\n* Bishop: \"the Right Reverend\" (''Rt. Rev.''); formally addressed as ''My Lord'' rather than ''Your Excellency''. This style is an ancient one, and has been used in the western church for more than a thousand years; it corresponds to, but does not derive from, the Italian ''[[Monsignore]]'' and the French ''[[Monseigneur]]''. However, most bishops prefer to be addressed simply as ''Bishop'' (''Bp.'').\n\nIn Ireland, and in other countries whose Roman Catholic usage it influenced, all bishops, not archbishops alone, are titled ''the Most Reverend'' (''Most Rev.'').\n\nClergy are often referred to with the title ''Doctor'' (''Dr.''), or have ''D.D. (Doctor of Divinity)'' placed after their name, where justified by their possession of such degree.\n\n====Italy====\nSimilar to, and the source of, most of the U.S. English titles, with some variation:\n*Diocesan priest: ''The Reverend Lord'(Dominus in Latin)' (''Rev.do.''); ''Don''.\n*Religious priest: ''Padre''; ''Father'' (''Fr.'').\n*Religious sister: ''The Reverend Sister'' (''Rev. Sr.'').\n*(Permanent) Deacon: ''Deacon'' (''Dcn.'').\n\n====The Philippines====\nIn the predominantly [[Roman Catholicism in the Philippines|Catholic]] [[Philippines]], ecclesiastical address is adapted from American custom. The titles listed below are only used in the most formal occasions by media or official correspondence, save for the simpler forms of address. Post-nomials that indicate academic degree or membership in a religious order are usually included.\n\n* The [[Pope]] is always titled \"''Ang Kaniy\u00e1ng Kabanalan''\" ([[Filipino language|Filipino]] for \"[[His Holiness]]\"). As such, the Pope is styled \"''Ang Kaniy\u00e1ng Kabanalan Papa Francisco''\".\n* A cardinal is formally styled and addressed as \"''Ang Kaniy\u00e1ng Kabunyian''\", literally denoting \"His Illustriousness\" ([[Philippine English]] for \"[[His Eminence]]\"). Cardinals are informally addressed as \"Cardinal\" followed by their names; for example, \"Cardinal Juan\". Unlike in the USA or nations of the Commonwealth, the name of a cardinal is always inscribed in the formula first name, \"Cardinal\", and last name; for example, \"Juan Cardinal de la Cruz\".\n* An archbishop is titled \"''Ang Mah\u00e1l na Arsobispo''\" (\"His Excellency, the Archbishop\"). Archbishops are often addressed as \"Archbishop\" followed by their names; for example, \"Archbishop Juan de la Cruz\".\n* A bishop is titled \"''Ang Mah\u00e1l na Obispo''\" (\"[[Excellency|His Excellency]], the Bishop\"), in similar fashion to archbishops, and more commonly as \"''Ang Lubh\u00e1ng Kagalanggalang''\" (\"The [[Most Reverend]]\"). Also similar to archbishops, bishops are often addressed as \"Bishop\" followed by their names; for example, \"Bishop Juan de la Cruz\".\n* A [[monsignor]] is titled \"''Reberendo Monsenyor''\" (\"Reverend Monsignor\"), although if he holds extra administrative office he is titled according to his office. Vicars general, [[Vicar forane|forane]], and [[Episcopal Vicar|episcopal]] are titled \"Very Reverend\". Monsignori are colloquially addressed as \"Monsignor\" (abbreviated as \"Msgr.\"). As defined, the inscribed title is \"Monsignor\" followed by first and then last name, or \"The Reverend Monsignor\" followed by first and then last name, while the spoken address is \"Monsignor\" followed by only last name.{{Sfn | Secretary of State | 2000 | ps =: \"26. For Supernumerary Apostolic Protonotaries, Prelates of Honour and Chaplains of His Holiness there may be used the title 'Monsignor', preceded, where appropriate, by 'Reverend'\".}}\n* Priests, both diocesan and those of a religious order, are titled \"''Reberendo Padre''\" (\"Reverend Father\", abbreviated as \"Rev. Fr.\") before their first and then last names. Priests are colloquially addressed as \"Father\" (abbreviated as \"Fr.\") before either their true name or nickname.\n* A deacon is titled \"''Reberendo''\" (\"Reverend\"); for example, \"Reverend Juan de la Cruz\". Deacons are rarely titled \"Deacon\" followed by their names as in the [[United States]]. Instead, they are colloquially addressed as \"Rev.\" in contrast to priests who are addressed as \"Father\".\n* Consecrated persons:\n** Religious sisters are titled \"Sister\" (abbreviated as \"Sr.\"). Superiors are optionally titled \"Mother\" (abbreviated as \"Mo.\") and are usually addressed formally as \"Reverend Sister/Mother\" (abbreviated as \"Rev. Sr./Mo.\"); for example, \"Rev. Sr. Juana de la Cruz, OP\" or \"Rev. Mo. Juana de la Cruz, OSB\". Contemplative nuns are formally and colloquially titled \"''Sor''\", a truncation of \"''Soror''\", which is [[Latin]] for \"Sister\". Prioresses and abbesses are formally addressed as \"Reverend Mother\".\n** Religious brothers who are not priests are titled \"Brother\" (abbreviated as \"Br.\"); for example, \"Br. Juan de la Cruz, OFM\". Like their female counterparts, contemplative monks are addressed as \"''Fra''\", a truncation of \"''Frater''\", which is [[Latin]] for \"Brother\". Sometimes monks who are priests are also addressed as \"''Fra''\".\n\n===Eastern Catholic clergy===\n\nAlthough the styles and titles of Eastern Catholic clergy varies from language to language, in the Greek and Arabic-speaking world the following would be acceptable, but is by no means a full list of appropriate titles. It is notable that surnames are never used except in extra-ecclesial matters or to specify a particular person where many share one Christian name or ordination name. Where not noted, Western titles may be supposed. The following are common in Greek Melkite Catholic usage and in Greek Orthodox usage in the United States.\n\nBishop / Archbishop: In Arabic, a bishop is styled \"Sayedna,\" while in Syriac-tradition churches, he is styled \"[[Mar]]\". If an Eastern Catholic Archbishop or Patriarch is made a Cardinal by the Pope, he may be addressed as \"His Eminence\" or use the hybrid title \"His Beatitude and Eminence\". \n\nPriest: In Arabic, \"Abouna\", and in Greek \"Pappas\".\n\nDeacon: Identical to a priest in all ways except \"Father Deacon\" is also heard (\"Abouna Shammas\" or \"Pappas Diakonos\").\n\nSubdeacon: Reverend Subdeacon in written address, but the Christian name with or without \"Brother\" is usually used, except some traditions where \"Father Subdeacon\" is used. In Arabic, this is confused by the word \"Shammas\" being used for both the subdeaconate and the deaconate, the distinction being a \"Deacon of the Letter\" and a \"Deacon of the Gospel,\" respectively. Often a Deacon will be addressed as \"Father\" and the subdeacon as \"Brother\" to make the distinction clear.\n\nReader: Readers are addressed as \"Reader\" or \"Brother\" depending on the preference of the addresser.\n\nSeminarians: \"Brother\" or \"Brother Seminarian\" is the most common title; the appellation \"Father Seminarian\" or \"Father Student\" is not seen outside of rural Greek and Arabic-speaking laity.\n\nTonsured individuals of no title: Brother.\n\n==Eastern Orthodox Church==\n[[File:Slovo4.jpg|thumb|An Eastern Orthodox priest blesses his congregation at the conclusion of the [[Divine Liturgy]]]]\nUsage varies somewhat throughout the [[Eastern Orthodox Church#Eastern Orthodox churches in communion|Eastern Orthodox Communion]], and not every church uses every clerical rank. Surnames are typically not used for archpastors (rank of bishop or above) or monastics.\n\n* [[Ecumenical Patriarch]] of [[Constantinople]]: Ecumenical Patriarch John II, His All-Holiness, Your All-Holiness\n* [[Patriarch]]: Patriarch John II of Terirem, Patriarch John, His Beatitude, Your Beatitude\n** ''Note:'' Some Patriarchs use the honorific \"His/Your Holiness\"\n* [[Archbishop]]\n** of an independent Church: The Most Reverend (Rev.)

In Britain and countries whose Roman Catholic usage it directly influenced:\n* Archbishop: ''the Most Reverend'' (''Most Rev.''); addressed as ''Your Grace'' rather than ''His Excellency'' or ''Your Excellency''.\n* Bishop: \"the Right Reverend\" (''Rt. Rev.''); formally addressed as ''My Lord'' rather than ''Your Excellency''. This style is an ancient one, and has been used in the western church for more than a thousand years; it corresponds to, but does not derive from, the Italian ''[[Monsignore]]'' and the French ''[[Monseigneur]]''. However, most bishops prefer to be addressed simply as ''Bishop'' (''Bp.'').\n\nIn Ireland, and in other countries whose Roman Catholic usage it influenced, all bishops, not archbishops alone, are titled ''the Most Reverend'' (''Most Rev.'').\n\nClergy are often referred to with the title ''Doctor'' (''Dr.''), or have ''D.D. (Doctor of Divinity)'' placed after their name, where justified by their possession of such degree.\n\n====Italy====\nSimilar to, and the source of, most of the U.S. English titles, with some variation:\n*Diocesan priest: ''The Reverend Lord'(Dominus in Latin)' (''Rev.do.''); ''Don''.\n*Religious priest: ''Padre''; ''Father'' (''Fr.'').\n*Religious sister: ''The Reverend Sister'' (''Rev. Sr.'').\n*(Permanent) Deacon: ''Deacon'' (''Dcn.'').\n\n====The Philippines====\nIn the predominantly [[Roman Catholicism in the Philippines|Catholic]] [[Philippines]], ecclesiastical address is adapted from American custom. The titles listed below are only used in the most formal occasions by media or official correspondence, save for the simpler forms of address. Post-nomials that indicate academic degree or membership in a religious order are usually included.\n\n* The [[Pope]] is always titled \"''Ang Kaniy\u00e1ng Kabanalan''\" ([[Filipino language|Filipino]] for \"[[His Holiness]]\"). As such, the Pope is styled \"''Ang Kaniy\u00e1ng Kabanalan Papa Francisco''\".\n* A cardinal is formally styled and addressed as \"''Ang Kaniy\u00e1ng Kabunyian''\", literally denoting \"His Illustriousness\" ([[Philippine English]] for \"[[His Eminence]]\"). Cardinals are informally addressed as \"Cardinal\" followed by their names; for example, \"Cardinal Juan\". Unlike in the USA or nations of the Commonwealth, the name of a cardinal is always inscribed in the formula first name, \"Cardinal\", and last name; for example, \"Juan Cardinal de la Cruz\".\n* An archbishop is titled \"''Ang Mah\u00e1l na Arsobispo''\" (\"His Excellency, the Archbishop\"). Archbishops are often addressed as \"Archbishop\" followed by their names; for example, \"Archbishop Juan de la Cruz\".\n* A bishop is titled \"''Ang Mah\u00e1l na Obispo''\" (\"[[Excellency|His Excellency]], the Bishop\"), in similar fashion to archbishops, and more commonly as \"''Ang Lubh\u00e1ng Kagalanggalang''\" (\"The [[Most Reverend]]\"). Also similar to archbishops, bishops are often addressed as \"Bishop\" followed by their names; for example, \"Bishop Juan de la Cruz\".\n* A [[monsignor]] is titled \"''Reberendo Monsenyor''\" (\"Reverend Monsignor\"), although if he holds extra administrative office he is titled according to his office. Vicars general, [[Vicar forane|forane]], and [[Episcopal Vicar|episcopal]] are titled \"Very Reverend\". Monsignori are colloquially addressed as \"Monsignor\" (abbreviated as \"Msgr.\"). As defined, the inscribed title is \"Monsignor\" followed by first and then last name, or \"The Reverend Monsignor\" followed by first and then last name, while the spoken address is \"Monsignor\" followed by only last name.{{Sfn | Secretary of State | 2000 | ps =: \"26. For Supernumerary Apostolic Protonotaries, Prelates of Honour and Chaplains of His Holiness there may be used the title 'Monsignor', preceded, where appropriate, by 'Reverend'\".}}\n* Priests, both diocesan and those of a religious order, are titled \"''Reberendo Padre''\" (\"Reverend Father\", abbreviated as \"Rev. Fr.\") before their first and then last names. Priests are colloquially addressed as \"Father\" (abbreviated as \"Fr.\") before either their true name or nickname.\n* A deacon is titled \"''Reberendo''\" (\"Reverend\"); for example, \"Reverend Juan de la Cruz\". Deacons are rarely titled \"Deacon\" followed by their names as in the [[United States]]. Instead, they are colloquially addressed as \"Rev.\" in contrast to priests who are addressed as \"Father\".\n* Consecrated persons:\n** Religious sisters are titled \"Sister\" (abbreviated as \"Sr.\"). Superiors are optionally titled \"Mother\" (abbreviated as \"Mo.\") and are usually addressed formally as \"Reverend Sister/Mother\" (abbreviated as \"Rev. Sr./Mo.\"); for example, \"Rev. Sr. Juana de la Cruz, OP\" or \"Rev. Mo. Juana de la Cruz, OSB\". Contemplative nuns are formally and colloquially titled \"''Sor''\", a truncation of \"''Soror''\", which is [[Latin]] for \"Sister\". Prioresses and abbesses are formally addressed as \"Reverend Mother\".\n** Religious brothers who are not priests are titled \"Brother\" (abbreviated as \"Br.\"); for example, \"Br. Juan de la Cruz, OFM\". Like their female counterparts, contemplative monks are addressed as \"''Fra''\", a truncation of \"''Frater''\", which is [[Latin]] for \"Brother\". Sometimes monks who are priests are also addressed as \"''Fra''\".\n\n===Eastern Catholic clergy===\n\nAlthough the styles and titles of Eastern Catholic clergy varies from language to language, in the Greek and Arabic-speaking world the following would be acceptable, but is by no means a full list of appropriate titles. It is notable that surnames are never used except in extra-ecclesial matters or to specify a particular person where many share one Christian name or ordination name. Where not noted, Western titles may be supposed. The following are common in Greek Melkite Catholic usage and in Greek Orthodox usage in the United States.\n\nBishop / Archbishop: In Arabic, a bishop is styled \"Sayedna,\" while in Syriac-tradition churches, he is styled \"[[Mar]]\". If an Eastern Catholic Archbishop or Patriarch is made a Cardinal by the Pope, he may be addressed as \"His Eminence\" or use the hybrid title \"His Beatitude and Eminence\". \n\nPriest: In Arabic, \"Abouna\", and in Greek \"Pappas\".\n\nDeacon: Identical to a priest in all ways except \"Father Deacon\" is also heard (\"Abouna Shammas\" or \"Pappas Diakonos\").\n\nSubdeacon: Reverend Subdeacon in written address, but the Christian name with or without \"Brother\" is usually used, except some traditions where \"Father Subdeacon\" is used. In Arabic, this is confused by the word \"Shammas\" being used for both the subdeaconate and the deaconate, the distinction being a \"Deacon of the Letter\" and a \"Deacon of the Gospel,\" respectively. Often a Deacon will be addressed as \"Father\" and the subdeacon as \"Brother\" to make the distinction clear.\n\nReader: Readers are addressed as \"Reader\" or \"Brother\" depending on the preference of the addresser.\n\nSeminarians: \"Brother\" or \"Brother Seminarian\" is the most common title; the appellation \"Father Seminarian\" or \"Father Student\" is not seen outside of rural Greek and Arabic-speaking laity.\n\nTonsured individuals of no title: Brother.\n\n==Eastern Orthodox Church==\n[[File:Slovo4.jpg|thumb|An Eastern Orthodox priest blesses his congregation at the conclusion of the [[Divine Liturgy]]]]\nUsage varies somewhat throughout the [[Eastern Orthodox Church#Eastern Orthodox churches in communion|Eastern Orthodox Communion]], and not every church uses every clerical rank. Surnames are typically not used for archpastors (rank of bishop or above) or monastics.\n\n* [[Ecumenical Patriarch]] of [[Constantinople]]: Ecumenical Patriarch John II, His All-Holiness, Your All-Holiness\n* [[Patriarch]]: Patriarch John II of Terirem, Patriarch John, His Beatitude, Your Beatitude\n** ''Note:'' Some Patriarchs use the honorific \"His/Your Holiness\"\n* [[Archbishop]]\n** of an independent Church: The Most Reverend (Rev.)

''The Sphinx: Its history in the light of recent excavations''. Cairo: Government Press, 1949.</ref>}}\n\nThe circumstantial evidence mentioned by Hassan includes the Sphinx's location in the context of the funerary complex surrounding the Second Pyramid, which is traditionally connected with Khafre.<ref>Lehner, Mark (Spring 2002).

Arab authors described the Sphinx as a [[talisman]] which guarded the area from the desert.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=rdI96px90kUC&pg=PA88 Okasha El Daly \"Egyptology: The Missing Millennium: Ancient Egypt in Medieval Arabic Writings\", Routledge p. 88]</ref> [[Al-Maqrizi]] describes it as the \"talisman of the Nile\" on which the locals believed the [[Season of the Inundation|flood cycle]] depended.<ref>{{cite book|title=Arabic Humanities, Islamic Thought: Essays in Honor of Everett K.

[[Alexandria]], [[Rosetta]], [[Damietta]], [[Cairo]] and the Giza Pyramids are described repeatedly, but not necessarily comprehensively.  Many accounts were published and widely read.  These include those of [[George Sandys]], [[Andr\u00e9 Th\u00e9vet]], [[Athanasius Kircher]], [[Balthasar de Monconys]], [[Jean de Th\u00e9venot]], [[John Greaves]], [[Johann Michael Vansleb]], [[Beno\u00eet de Maillet]], [[Cornelis de Bruijn]], [[Paul Lucas (traveller)|Paul Lucas]], [[Richard Pococke]], [[Frederic Louis Norden]] and others. But there is an even larger set of more anonymous people who wrote obscure and little-read works, sometimes only unpublished manuscripts in libraries or private collections, including Henry Castela, Hans Ludwig von Lichtenstein, Michael Heberer von Bretten, [[Wilhelm von Boldensele]], [[Pierre Belon du Mans]], [[Vincent Stochove]], [[Kry\u0161tof Harant|Christophe Harant]], Gilles Fermanel, Robert Fauvel, Jean Palerne Foresien, Willian Lithgow, [[Joos van Ghistele]], etc.\n\nOver the centuries, writers and scholars have recorded their impressions and reactions upon seeing the Sphinx.  The vast majority were concerned with a general description, often including a mixture of science, romance and mystique. A typical description of the Sphinx by tourists and leisure travelers throughout the 19th and 20th century was made by [[John Lawson Stoddard]]:\n{{quotation|It is the antiquity of the Sphinx which thrills us as we look upon it, for in itself it has no charms. The desert's waves have risen to its breast, as if to wrap the monster in a winding-sheet of gold. The face and head have been mutilated by Moslem fanatics. The mouth, the beauty of whose lips was once admired, is now expressionless. Yet grand in its loneliness, \u2013 veiled in the mystery of unnamed ages, \u2013 the relic of Egyptian antiquity stands solemn and silent in the presence of the awful desert&nbsp;\u2013 symbol of eternity. Here it disputes with Time the empire of the past; forever gazing on and on into a future which will still be distant when we, like all who have preceded us and looked upon its face, have lived our little lives and disappeared.<ref>{{cite journal | title=John L. Stoddard's Lectures | date=1898 | volume=2 | page=111}}</ref>}}\n\nFrom the 16th century far into the 19th century, observers repeatedly noted that the Sphinx has the face, neck and breast of a woman.  Examples included Johannes Helferich (1579), [[George Sandys]] (1615), [[Johann Michael Vansleb]] (1677), [[Beno\u00eet de Maillet]] (1735) and [[Elliot Warburton]] (1844).\n\nMost early Western images were book illustrations in [[printmaking|print]] form, elaborated by a professional [[engraver]] from either previous images available or some original drawing or sketch supplied by an author, and usually now lost.  Seven years after visiting Giza, Andr\u00e9 Th\u00e9vet (''Cosmographie de Levant'', 1556) described the Sphinx as \"the head of a colossus, caused to be made by Isis, daughter of Inachus, then so beloved of Jupiter\". He, or his artist and engraver, pictured it as a curly-haired monster with a grassy dog collar. Athanasius Kircher (who never visited Egypt) depicted the Sphinx as a Roman statue, reflecting his ability to conceptualize (''[[Turris Babel]]'', 1679). Johannes Helferich's (1579) Sphinx is a pinched-face, round-breasted woman with a straight haired wig; the only edge over Th\u00e9vet is that the hair suggests the flaring lappets of the headdress. George Sandys stated that the Sphinx was a [[harlot]]; Balthasar de Monconys interpreted the headdress as a kind of hairnet, while [[Fran\u00e7ois de La Boullaye-Le Gouz]]'s Sphinx had a rounded hairdo with bulky collar.{{fact|date=February 2019}}\n\nRichard Pococke's Sphinx was an adoption of Cornelis de Bruijn's drawing of 1698, featuring only minor changes, but is closer to the actual appearance of the Sphinx than anything previous.  The print versions of Norden's careful drawings for his ''[[Voyage d'Egypte et de Nubie]]'', 1755 are the first to clearly show that the nose was missing.  However, from the time of the Napoleonic invasion of Egypt onwards, a number of accurate images were widely available in Europe, and copied by others.{{fact|date=February 2019}}\n\n===Legacy===\n''Mystery of the Sphinx'', narrated by [[Charlton Heston]], a documentary presenting the theories of [[John Anthony West]], was shown as an [[NBC]] Special on 10 November 1993. A 95-minute DVD, ''Mystery of the Sphinx: Expanded Edition'', was released in 2007. ''Age of the Sphinx'', a [[BBC Two]] ''[[Timewatch]]'' documentary presenting the theories of John Anthony West and critical to both sides of the argument, was shown on 27 November 1994. In [[2008 in film|2008]], the film ''[[10,000 BC (film)|10,000&nbsp;BC]]'' showed a supposed original Sphinx with a lion's head. Before this film, this lion head theory had been published in [[documentary film]]s about the origin of the Sphinx.{{fact|date=February 2019}}\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" class=\"center\">\nimage:Andr\u00e9 Th\u00e9vet, 1556.png|Andr\u00e9 Th\u00e9vet, ''Cosmographie de Levant'' (1556)\nimage:Hogenberg & Braun, 1572.png|Hogenberg and Braun (map), ''Cairus, quae olim Babylon'' (1572), exists in various editions, from various authors, with the Sphinx looking different.\nimage:Jan Sommer, 1591.png|Jan Sommer, (unpublished) ''Voyages en Egypte des annees 1589, 1590 & 1591'', Institut de France, 1971 (Voyageurs occidentaux en \u00c9gypte 3)\nimage:George Sandys, 1615.png|George Sandys, ''A relation of a journey begun an dom. 1610'' (1615)\nimage:Fran\u00e7ois de La Boullaye-Le Gouz, 1653.png|Fran\u00e7ois de La Boullaye-Le Gouz, ''Les Voyages et Observations'' (1653)\nimage:Balthasar de Monconys, 1665.png|Balthasar de Monconys, ''Journal des voyages'' (1665)\nimage:Olfert Dapper, 1665.png|[[Olfert Dapper]], ''Description de l'Afrique'' (1665), note the two different displays of the Sphinx.\nimage:Cornelis de Bruijn, 1698.png|[[Cornelis de Bruijn]], ''Reizen van Cornelis de Bruyn door de vermaardste Deelen van Klein Asia'' (1698)\nimage:Norden, 1755 (2).png|The Sphinx as seen by [[Frederic Louis Norden]] (sketches made 1737, published 1755)\nimage:Norden, 1755 (1).png|Frederic Louis Norden, ''Voyage d'\u00c9gypte et de Nubie'' (1755)\nimage:Description de l'Egypte, 1823(1).png|''[[Description de l'Egypte (1809)|Description de l'Egypte]]'' (Panckoucke edition), Planches, Antiquit\u00e9s, volume V (1823), also published in the Imperial edition of 1822\nimage:Description de l'Egypte, 1823(2).png|''[[Description de l'Egypte (1809)|Description de l'Egypte]]'' (Panckoucke edition), Planches, Antiquit\u00e9s, volume V (1823), also published in the Imperial edition of 1822.\nImage:Japanese Mission Sphinx.jpg|Members of the [[Second Japanese Embassy to Europe (1863)]] in front of the Sphinx, 1864\nImage:Bonaparte ante la Esfinge, por Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me.jpg|[[Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me]]'s ''[[Bonaparte Before the Sphinx]]'', 1886\nimage:Johanne Baptista Homann, 1724.png|Johanne Baptista Homann (map), ''Aegyptus hodierna'' (1724)\nimage:S10.08 Gizeh, image 9937.jpg|Lantern Slide Collection: Views, Objects: Egypt.

Images depicting the Egyptian king in the form of a lion smiting his enemies date as far back as the Early Dynastic Period.{{fact|date=February 2019}}\n\nIn the [[New Kingdom]], the Sphinx became more specifically associated with the sun god ''Hor-em-akhet'' ([[Hellenization|Hellenized]]: ''Harmachis'') or \"Horus-at-the-Horizon\". Pharaoh [[Amenhotep&nbsp;II]] (1427\u20131401 or 1397&nbsp;BC) built a temple to the northeast of the Sphinx nearly 1000 years after its construction and dedicated it to the cult of ''Hor-em-akhet''.<ref>Stadelmann, Rainer (2001). \"Giza\". In Redford, Donald B. (ed), ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt''. Volume II, p. 29</ref>\n\nSome ancient non-Egyptians saw it as a likeliness of the god [[Ancient Canaanite religion|Horon]]. The cult of the Sphinx continued into medieval times. The [[Sabians]] of [[Harran]] saw it as the burial place of [[Hermes Trismegistus]]. Arab authors described the Sphinx as a [[talisman]] which guarded the area from the desert.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=rdI96px90kUC&pg=PA88 Okasha El Daly \"Egyptology: The Missing Millennium: Ancient Egypt in Medieval Arabic Writings\", Routledge p. 88]</ref> [[Al-Maqrizi]] describes it as the \"talisman of the Nile\" on which the locals believed the [[Season of the Inundation|flood cycle]] depended.<ref>{{cite book|title=Arabic Humanities, Islamic Thought: Essays in Honor of Everett K.

[[Alexandria]], [[Rosetta]], [[Damietta]], [[Cairo]] and the Giza Pyramids are described repeatedly, but not necessarily comprehensively.  Many accounts were published and widely read.  These include those of [[George Sandys]], [[Andr\u00e9 Th\u00e9vet]], [[Athanasius Kircher]], [[Balthasar de Monconys]], [[Jean de Th\u00e9venot]], [[John Greaves]], [[Johann Michael Vansleb]], [[Beno\u00eet de Maillet]], [[Cornelis de Bruijn]], [[Paul Lucas (traveller)|Paul Lucas]], [[Richard Pococke]], [[Frederic Louis Norden]] and others. But there is an even larger set of more anonymous people who wrote obscure and little-read works, sometimes only unpublished manuscripts in libraries or private collections, including Henry Castela, Hans Ludwig von Lichtenstein, Michael Heberer von Bretten, [[Wilhelm von Boldensele]], [[Pierre Belon du Mans]], [[Vincent Stochove]], [[Kry\u0161tof Harant|Christophe Harant]], Gilles Fermanel, Robert Fauvel, Jean Palerne Foresien, Willian Lithgow, [[Joos van Ghistele]], etc.\n\nOver the centuries, writers and scholars have recorded their impressions and reactions upon seeing the Sphinx.  The vast majority were concerned with a general description, often including a mixture of science, romance and mystique. A typical description of the Sphinx by tourists and leisure travelers throughout the 19th and 20th century was made by [[John Lawson Stoddard]]:\n{{quotation|It is the antiquity of the Sphinx which thrills us as we look upon it, for in itself it has no charms. The desert's waves have risen to its breast, as if to wrap the monster in a winding-sheet of gold. The face and head have been mutilated by Moslem fanatics. The mouth, the beauty of whose lips was once admired, is now expressionless. Yet grand in its loneliness, \u2013 veiled in the mystery of unnamed ages, \u2013 the relic of Egyptian antiquity stands solemn and silent in the presence of the awful desert&nbsp;\u2013 symbol of eternity. Here it disputes with Time the empire of the past; forever gazing on and on into a future which will still be distant when we, like all who have preceded us and looked upon its face, have lived our little lives and disappeared.<ref>{{cite journal | title=John L. Stoddard's Lectures | date=1898 | volume=2 | page=111}}</ref>}}\n\nFrom the 16th century far into the 19th century, observers repeatedly noted that the Sphinx has the face, neck and breast of a woman.  Examples included Johannes Helferich (1579), [[George Sandys]] (1615), [[Johann Michael Vansleb]] (1677), [[Beno\u00eet de Maillet]] (1735) and [[Elliot Warburton]] (1844).\n\nMost early Western images were book illustrations in [[printmaking|print]] form, elaborated by a professional [[engraver]] from either previous images available or some original drawing or sketch supplied by an author, and usually now lost.  Seven years after visiting Giza, Andr\u00e9 Th\u00e9vet (''Cosmographie de Levant'', 1556) described the Sphinx as \"the head of a colossus, caused to be made by Isis, daughter of Inachus, then so beloved of Jupiter\". He, or his artist and engraver, pictured it as a curly-haired monster with a grassy dog collar. Athanasius Kircher (who never visited Egypt) depicted the Sphinx as a Roman statue, reflecting his ability to conceptualize (''[[Turris Babel]]'', 1679). Johannes Helferich's (1579) Sphinx is a pinched-face, round-breasted woman with a straight haired wig; the only edge over Th\u00e9vet is that the hair suggests the flaring lappets of the headdress. George Sandys stated that the Sphinx was a [[harlot]]; Balthasar de Monconys interpreted the headdress as a kind of hairnet, while [[Fran\u00e7ois de La Boullaye-Le Gouz]]'s Sphinx had a rounded hairdo with bulky collar.{{fact|date=February 2019}}\n\nRichard Pococke's Sphinx was an adoption of Cornelis de Bruijn's drawing of 1698, featuring only minor changes, but is closer to the actual appearance of the Sphinx than anything previous.  The print versions of Norden's careful drawings for his ''[[Voyage d'Egypte et de Nubie]]'', 1755 are the first to clearly show that the nose was missing.  However, from the time of the Napoleonic invasion of Egypt onwards, a number of accurate images were widely available in Europe, and copied by others.{{fact|date=February 2019}}\n\n===Legacy===\n''Mystery of the Sphinx'', narrated by [[Charlton Heston]], a documentary presenting the theories of [[John Anthony West]], was shown as an [[NBC]] Special on 10 November 1993. A 95-minute DVD, ''Mystery of the Sphinx: Expanded Edition'', was released in 2007. ''Age of the Sphinx'', a [[BBC Two]] ''[[Timewatch]]'' documentary presenting the theories of John Anthony West and critical to both sides of the argument, was shown on 27 November 1994. In [[2008 in film|2008]], the film ''[[10,000 BC (film)|10,000&nbsp;BC]]'' showed a supposed original Sphinx with a lion's head. Before this film, this lion head theory had been published in [[documentary film]]s about the origin of the Sphinx.{{fact|date=February 2019}}\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" class=\"center\">\nimage:Andr\u00e9 Th\u00e9vet, 1556.png|Andr\u00e9 Th\u00e9vet, ''Cosmographie de Levant'' (1556)\nimage:Hogenberg & Braun, 1572.png|Hogenberg and Braun (map), ''Cairus, quae olim Babylon'' (1572), exists in various editions, from various authors, with the Sphinx looking different.\nimage:Jan Sommer, 1591.png|Jan Sommer, (unpublished) ''Voyages en Egypte des annees 1589, 1590 & 1591'', Institut de France, 1971 (Voyageurs occidentaux en \u00c9gypte 3)\nimage:George Sandys, 1615.png|George Sandys, ''A relation of a journey begun an dom. 1610'' (1615)\nimage:Fran\u00e7ois de La Boullaye-Le Gouz, 1653.png|Fran\u00e7ois de La Boullaye-Le Gouz, ''Les Voyages et Observations'' (1653)\nimage:Balthasar de Monconys, 1665.png|Balthasar de Monconys, ''Journal des voyages'' (1665)\nimage:Olfert Dapper, 1665.png|[[Olfert Dapper]], ''Description de l'Afrique'' (1665), note the two different displays of the Sphinx.\nimage:Cornelis de Bruijn, 1698.png|[[Cornelis de Bruijn]], ''Reizen van Cornelis de Bruyn door de vermaardste Deelen van Klein Asia'' (1698)\nimage:Norden, 1755 (2).png|The Sphinx as seen by [[Frederic Louis Norden]] (sketches made 1737, published 1755)\nimage:Norden, 1755 (1).png|Frederic Louis Norden, ''Voyage d'\u00c9gypte et de Nubie'' (1755)\nimage:Description de l'Egypte, 1823(1).png|''[[Description de l'Egypte (1809)|Description de l'Egypte]]'' (Panckoucke edition), Planches, Antiquit\u00e9s, volume V (1823), also published in the Imperial edition of 1822\nimage:Description de l'Egypte, 1823(2).png|''[[Description de l'Egypte (1809)|Description de l'Egypte]]'' (Panckoucke edition), Planches, Antiquit\u00e9s, volume V (1823), also published in the Imperial edition of 1822.\nImage:Japanese Mission Sphinx.jpg|Members of the [[Second Japanese Embassy to Europe (1863)]] in front of the Sphinx, 1864\nImage:Bonaparte ante la Esfinge, por Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me.jpg|[[Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me]]'s ''[[Bonaparte Before the Sphinx]]'', 1886\nimage:Johanne Baptista Homann, 1724.png|Johanne Baptista Homann (map), ''Aegyptus hodierna'' (1724)\nimage:S10.08 Gizeh, image 9937.jpg|Lantern Slide Collection: Views, Objects: Egypt.

But the leader of the goons doesn't want to kill the babies, so he adopts one (Michael), leaves one in an orphanage (Raju), one in a temple (Kameshwaran) who is picked by Palakkad Mani Iyer, and one (Madhan) in a car that belongs to Venugopal.\n\n30 years later, Madhan is now a London-educated businessman and the \"adopted\" son of Venugopal. He returns from London after his father's death to take over the business. But unbeknownst to him, Venugopal's car accident was planned by Nandagopal and Ramu for the want of his father's property. But Venugopal's will has named Madhan as the heir to all his wealth.\n\nMeanwhile, Michael has become a petty criminal like his foster father. While escaping from the police, they accidentally cause a fire in an art gallery where an artist Shalini is conducting an exhibition. A firefighter Raju saves Shalini and her paintings, and they fall in love after she gifts him a rice painting of Taj Mahal.\n\nKameshwaran is introduced as a cook for weddings and special events. He meets Thirupurasundari and her kleptomaniac grandmother. After a series of hilarious interactions, Kameshwaran and Thirupu fall in love and their wedding is being arranged\n\nAn unknown woman telephones Madhan tells him that his father's death was not an accident, and asks him to meet her in Chennai. After being distracted by a young girl named Chakkubai and her mother Gangubai, Madhan finally meets Sushila who called him. But he doesn't know that she is his real mother.\n\nWhile escaping from goons sent by Nandagopal and Ramu, Madhan meets Raju who fights the goons and saves him. He asks Raju to impersonate him for a while in Bangalore till he investigates his father's death in Chennai. Raju (while pretending to be Madhan) meets Shalini and her father who are also going to Bangalore, and invites them to stay with him.\n\nMichael is hired to kill Madhan and finds out that he is in Chennai. Meanwhile Madhan and Chakkubai have fallen in love and he presents her with a ring, but they are spied on by Michael and his father. Sushila meets Madhan again and reveals that his father in alive but is mentally unstable after the accident. Michael and his foster father arrive at the scene and kidnap all of them to a mountain cabin near Bangalore.\n\nOn the day of Kameshwaran's wedding, Avinashi sees him and asks him to impersonate Madhan to get 6 lakhs from his locker. Back in Madhan's house in Bangalore,\nRaju and Shalini meet and profess their love for one another. Michael (also dressed as Madhan) and his father arrive at Madhan's house to loot it. Michael sees Raju, mistakes him for Madhan and thinks that Madhan has escaped from the cabin. He knocks Raju unconscious.\n\nAvinashi sees the unconscious Raju, assumes it was the effect of his drugged soup, and brings Kameshwaran into the house to retrieve his money. Kameshwaran is mistaken for Raju by Shalini who then tries to get intimate with him. Thirupu and her grandmother drag Kameshwaran away from her. Shalini then witnesses Kameshwaran hugging Thirupu. This enrages her as she thinks that Raju is two-timing her. To add to the hilarity, Chakkubai and Gangubai also arrive at the house in search of Madhan.\n\nChakkubai mistakes Kameshwaran for Madhan and introduces herself to everyone as Madhan's fianc\u00e9e, much to Avinashi's dismay, as his plan of using Kameshwaran to access Madhan's money keeps getting comically disrupted first by Raju's then by Madhan's girlfriend. Shalini takes a hunting rifle and holds everyone at gunpoint. Avinashi and the rest try to tell her that Kameshwaran is not Madhan/Raju but she does not believe them. Meanwhile, the real Madhan has escaped the cabin with his parents and comes to the house. In the midst of all this confusion, Michael steals Madhan's wealth and escapes to the cabin. The rest of the crew follows them back to the cabin in multiple cars.\n\nRamu and Nandagopal are already present in the cabin and hold everyone at gunpoint as they arrive one by one. All four brothers are finally in the same room at the same time and Sushila tells them that they are her quadruplets. The presence of all the people in the small cabin causes it to tilt over the cliff edge. The bad men are knocked out and the four brothers work together to safely get everyone out of the cabin.
