It begins at [[Nippori Station]] in [[Arakawa, Tokyo]] and approximately parallels the Pacific coasts of [[Chiba Prefecture|Chiba]], [[Ibaraki Prefecture|Ibaraki]], and [[Fukushima Prefecture]]s before the line officially ends at [[Iwanuma Station]] in [[Iwanuma, Miyagi]]. However, northbound trains at Tokyo originate at {{STN|Ueno}} (and [[Shinagawa Station|Shinagawa]] with the opening of the [[Ueno\u2013Tokyo Line]] on March 14, 2015) rather than Nippori; likewise, many trains continue past Iwanuma onto the [[T\u014dhoku Main Line]] tracks to {{STN|Sendai|Miyagi}}.\n\nThe name \"J\u014dban\" is derived from the names of the former [[province]]s of [[Hitachi Province|Hitachi]] ('''\u5e38'''\u9678) and [[Iwaki Province (1868)|Iwaki]] ('''\u78d0'''\u57ce), which are connected by the line to reach Tokyo.\n\nThe section of the J\u014dban Line between [[Tomioka Station|Tomioka]] and [[Namie Station|Namie]], which extends through the exclusion zone surrounding the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear meltdown, closed in the wake of the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]] and [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]], but was reopened on 14 March 2020.<ref name=\"nhk20161210\">{{cite web|url=https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20161210_15/ |title=Tsunami-hit railway line partially reopens - News - NHK WORLD - English |publisher=.nhk.or.jp |date= |accessdate=2016-12-10}}</ref>\n\n==Basic data==\n*Operators, distances:\n**[[East Japan Railway Company]] (JR East) (Services and tracks)\n***Nippori \u2013 Haranomachi \u2013 Iwanuma: {{convert|343.1|km|mi|1|abbr=on}}\n***Mikawashima \u2013 Sumidagawa \u2013 Minami-Senju (Sumidagawa freight branch): {{convert|5.7|km|mi|1|abbr=on}}\n***Mikawashima \u2013 Tabata (Tabata freight branch): {{convert|1.6|km|mi|1|abbr=on}}\n**[[Japan Freight Railway Company]] (JR Freight) (Services)\n***Mikawashima \u2013 Haranomachi \u2013 Iwanuma: {{convert|341.9|km|mi|1|abbr=on}}\n***Mikawashima \u2013 Sumidagawa \u2013 Minami-Senju (Sumidagawa freight branch): {{convert|5.7|km|mi|1|abbr=on}}\n***Mikawashima \u2013 Tabata (Tabata freight branch): {{convert|1.6|km|mi|1|abbr=on}}\n*Double/quadruple tracking:\n**Quadruple: Ayase \u2013 Toride\n**Double: Nippori \u2013 Ayase, Toride \u2013 Yotsukura, Hirono \u2013 Kido, \u014cno \u2013 Futaba\n*[[List of current systems for electric rail traction|Electrification]]:\n**1,500 V DC: Nippori \u2013 Toride, Mikawashima \u2013 Sumidagawa \u2013 Minami-Senju, Mikawashima \u2013 Tabata\n**20 kV AC, 50&nbsp;Hz: Fujishiro \u2013 Iwanuma.

After the opening of the [[T\u014dhoku Shinkansen]] in 1982, the J\u014dban Line was split into two parts at Iwaki. South of Iwaki is mainly double track (Ayase - Toride is quad track), and north of Iwaki is predominantly single track. After the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima disaster]] in 2011, the J\u014dban Line is further segmented in the Iwaki \u2013 Sendai section.\n\n===Shinagawa \u2013 Ueno \u2013 Iwaki===\nThis entire section is served by a variety of services, which will be explained below by the sections where they operate in.\n\nLimited express trains operate across the entire section. See ''[[Hitachi (Japanese train)|Hitachi]]'' and ''[[Tokiwa (train)|Tokiwa]]'' for details.\n\n====Shinagawa \u2013 Ueno \u2013 Toride====\nThis section is mainly served by local, rapid, medium distance train services serving the Greater Tokyo area.\n\n*{{JRLS|JL}} '''Local (\u5404\u99c5\u505c\u8eca''', literally means: Stops at every station): These local trains are commonly referred to as the '''J\u014dban Line (Local) \u5e38\u78d0\u7dda\u5404\u99c5\u505c\u8eca'''. All local trains operate through services to the [[Tokyo Metro Chiyoda Line]] to/from {{STN|Yoyogi-Uehara}} via [[Ayase Station|Ayase]], where the J\u014dban Line and Chiyoda Line meet; some trains continue through on the [[Odakyu Odawara Line]] to/from {{STN|Hon-Atsugi}} or the [[Odakyu Tama Line]] to/from {{STN|Karakida}}. Trains usually originate/terminate at [[Abiko Station (Chiba)|Abiko]]. At rush hours, trains originate/terminate at [[Toride Station|Toride]]. Occasionally trains won't go too far, originating/terminating at [[Matsudo Station|Matsudo]] or [[Kashiwa Station|Kashiwa]].\n*{{JRLS|JJ}} '''Rapid (\u5feb\u901f)''': Rapid trains are commonly referred to as the '''J\u014dban Line (Rapid) \u5e38\u78d0\u7dda\u5feb\u901f.''' These services run between the southern termini of [[Ueno Station|Ueno]] or [[Shinagawa Station|Shinagawa]] (via [[Ueno\u2013Tokyo Line|Ueno-Tokyo Line]]) to the northern termini of Toride. Some trains go on to the [[Narita Line]] to [[Narita Station|Narita]] via Abiko, and are referred to as '''J\u014dban\u30fbNarita Line (\u5e38\u78d0\u30fb\u6210\u7530\u7dda)''' trains. Rapid trains will skip some stations between [[Kita-Senju Station|Kita-Senju]] and Abiko, that local services mentioned above would stop.\n**{{Color box|#3333ff}} '''Local (Medium distance) (\u666e\u901a''', literally means: Regular) : The \"local\" here refers to '''medium distance''' trains that operate north beyond Toride and stop at all stations north of Toride. South of Toride, they operate as rapid services, and are referred as such.\n* {{Color box|Red}} '''Special Rapid (\u7279\u5225\u5feb\u901f)''' : Special Rapid trains operate between Shinagawa and [[Tsuchiura Station|Tsuchiura]], during non-rush hours at hourly intervals. These trains skip stations that even rapid trains would stop. This service is created to compete with the neighbouring railway line, the Tsukuba Express.\n\n====Shinagawa \u2013 Ueno \u2013 Mito \u2013 Katsuta====\nTrains that run beyond Toride are distinctly referred to as the '''J\u014dban Line \u5e38\u78d0\u7dda''', without the term \"Rapid\". Trains that are called J\u014dban Line (Rapid) cannot go beyond Toride, as their rolling stock cannot be powered by alternating current, which is the type of electrification that the section uses.\n\nThis section is mainly served by local trains.\n\n*{{Color box|#3333ff}} '''Local (\u666e\u901a)''' : These trains stop at every station north of Toride. Hence the name \"local\". There are two types of local trains:\n**'''Medium distance''' : These medium distance trains, as mentioned above, operate from central Tokyo to north of Toride and stop at all stations there. They terminate at various stations, namely Tsuchiura, [[Mito Station (Ibaraki)|Mito]] and [[Katsuta Station|Katsuta]].\n***{{Color box|Red}} '''Special Rapid (\u7279\u5225\u5feb\u901f)''' : Special Rapid trains stop at every station between Toride and Tsuchiura, so they're essentially the same as the medium distance trains, but become a different service once past south of Toride.\n** '''Mito Line through service''' : These trains run through services to the [[Mito Line]] via [[Tomobe Station]], operating from [[Oyama Station|Oyama]] to [[Katsuta Station|Katsuta]].\n\n====Mito \u2013 Iwaki====\nThis section is mainly served by local trains.\n\n*{{Color box|#3333ff}} '''Local (\u666e\u901a)''' : These trains stop at every station, operating between Mito and Takahagi / Iwaki\n**'''Medium distance / through service''': In early morning and late night, few medium distance trains and Mito Line through trains operate to as far as [[Takahagi Station|Takahagi]], which is located about mid-way in this section.\n\n===Iwaki \u2013 Sendai===\nBefore the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]] and the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]], local trains and limited express trains used to run across the entire section. However, due to the damages caused after the disaster, the section between Tomioka to Harunomachi had to be closed down, and services were suspended. After certain sections of the line were reconstructed, regular services were gradually allowed to resume.\n\n====Iwaki \u2013 Tomioka====\nThis section is served by local service trains. Trains cannot continue on beyond Tomioka as they once did, because the section beyond is closed (explained below).\n\n====Tomioka \u2013 Namie====\nThis section, which extends through the exclusion zone surrounding the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear meltdown, was suspended after the 2011 disaster. This section re-opened on 14 March 2020.<ref name=\"nhk20161210\" /> Prior to this date, services were provided by an interim bus service.\n\n====Namie \u2013 Sendai====\nThis section is served by local service trains, which serves the Greater Sendai area.\n\nThe section was once partially closed due to the 2011 disaster, but has since reopened in stages. The reconstructed segment between [[Hamayoshida Station|Hamayoshida]] and [[S\u014dma Station|S\u014dma]] was reopened on 10 December 2016, prior to which services were provided by an interim bus service.<ref>JR East press release: {{cite web|url=http://www.jrmito.com/press/111214/20111214_press03.pdf|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130121543/http://www.jrmito.com/press/111214/20111214_press03.pdf|archivedate=2012-01-30|url-status=dead|accessdate=2016-03-14|df=}}</ref><ref>Hongo, Jun, \"[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120311f1.html A year on, Tohoku stuck in limbo]\", ''[[The Japan Times]]'', 11 March 2012, p. 1.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jrmito.com/eq/index.html|title=\u6c34\u6238\u99c5\u30fb\u5e38\u78d0\u7dda\uff5cJR\u6771\u65e5\u672c\u65c5\u5ba2\u9244\u9053\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e \u6c34\u6238\u652f\u793e\uff5c\u6771\u65e5\u672c\u5927\u9707\u707d\u306b\u3088\u308b\u5217\u8eca\u5f71\u97ff\u3068\u904b\u8ee2\u898b\u8fbc\u307f\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066|date=|publisher=Jrmito.com|accessdate=2016-12-10}}</ref> JR East is currently inspecting the segment between [[Namie Station|Namie]] and Odaka in preparation for the surrounding areas being cleared for re-settlement.<ref>http://www.jreast.co.jp/pdf/damage03.pdf</ref> Train services between Namie and Odaka resumed on 1 April 2017.<ref name=\"mainichi.jp\">{{cite news|url=http://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20170401/p2a/00m/0na/020000c|title=Photo Journal: All aboard|author=|date=1 April 2017|newspaper=Mainichi Daily News|accessdate=21 March 2018}}</ref> Train services between Tatsuta and [[Tomioka Station|Tomioka]] resumed on 21 October 2017.<ref name=\"jt20171021\">{{cite news|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/10/21/national/7-km-part-joban-line-reopens-fukushima/|date=21 October 2017|language=English|title=7-km part of Joban Line reopens in Fukushima|accessdate=21 October 2017|newspaper=The Japan Times Online}}</ref>\n\n==Station list==\n[[File:\u5e38\u78d0\u7dda\u505c\u8eca\u99c5.png|1200px]]\n*The above is a diagram indicating J\u014dban Line service patterns within Greater Tokyo.\n*For more information on limited express services (i.e.''[[Hitachi (Japanese train)|Hitachi]]'' and ''[[Tokiwa (train)|Tokiwa]]''), see their respective pages.\n\n===Shinagawa \u2013 Ueno \u2013 Mito \u2013 Iwaki===\n;

The dates of the individual section openings are given below. After the line was nationalised in 1906, a program of double-tracking commenced in 1910, with the 219&nbsp;km section between Nippori and Yotsukura completed in 1925. The Hirono - Kido and Ono - Futaba sections were double-tracked in 1976.\n\nThe first section electrified was Nippori - Matsudo (at 1,500 V DC) in 1936, and extended to Toride in 1949. The Toride - Kusano section was electrified at 20 kV AC between 1961 and 1963, and extended to Iwanumi in 1967.\n\nThe [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]] caused severe disruption to the line, with services to Iwaki (209.4&nbsp;km from Nippori) re-established by 17 April, to Yotsukura (a further 9.8&nbsp;km) by 14 May, and to Hirono (another 13.2&nbsp;km) by 10 October 2011. Services on the 8.5&nbsp;km Hirono - Tatsuta section returned on 1 June 2014.\n\nAt the northern end, services on the isolated 20.1&nbsp;km Haranomachi - Soma section were restored on 21 December 2011, with services from Iwanuma to Hamayoshida (13.5&nbsp;km) restored on 16 March 2013. Services resumed on the 9.4&nbsp;km Haranomachi - Odaka section on 12 July 2016 and the 22.6&nbsp;km Hamayoshida - Soma section was rebuilt at a higher, tsunami-proof level, and reopened on 10 December 2016, re-establishing the connection to Sendai for stations north of Odaka.

CTC signalling was commissioned in 1969, and in 1971 the lines became the first electric railway in Japan converted to one-person operation. Both lines closed in 2005.\n* Izumi Station: The Onahama Horse tram opened a 762&nbsp;mm gauge line 5&nbsp;km to its namesake town in 1907, and extended the line a further 5&nbsp;km to Ena in 1916. The Onahama - Ena section closed in 1936, the company renamed itself the Onahama Port Railway in 1939, and converted the line to 1,067&nbsp;mm gauge in 1941. The [[Ena Railway]] rebuilt the Onahama - Ena section as 1,067&nbsp;mm gauge in 1953. In 1965 a typhoon caused the collapse of a retaining wall, and the Onahama - Ena section formally closed in 1967. The passenger service on the Izumi - Onahama section ceased in 1972, the line is now freight-only operated by the [[Fukushima Rinkai Railway Main Line|Fukushima Rinkai Railway]].\n* Yumoto station: The 10&nbsp;km 762mm gauge Iwaki Coalmine Railway operated to Onahama between 1905 and 1944.\n* Yumoto station: A 6&nbsp;km 762mm gauge line to Nagahashi was operated by the Iwaki City Council between 1914 and 1929.\n* Uchigo station: The Furukawa Co. built a 7&nbsp;km 762mm gauge line to the Kita-Yoshima coal mine in 1905. In 1908 the line was rebuilt to 1067mm gauge and shortened by 1&nbsp;km. The mine and line closed in 1969.\n* Iwaki station: The Yoshima and Akai local railways connected here, details of these lines are not currently available.\n\n==References==\nThis article incorporates

It begins at [[Nippori Station]] in [[Arakawa, Tokyo]] and approximately parallels the Pacific coasts of [[Chiba Prefecture|Chiba]], [[Ibaraki Prefecture|Ibaraki]], and [[Fukushima Prefecture]]s before the line officially ends at [[Iwanuma Station]] in [[Iwanuma, Miyagi]]. However, northbound trains at Tokyo originate at {{STN|Ueno}} (and [[Shinagawa Station|Shinagawa]] with the opening of the [[Ueno\u2013Tokyo Line]] on March 14, 2015) rather than Nippori; likewise, many trains continue past Iwanuma onto the [[T\u014dhoku Main Line]] tracks to {{STN|Sendai|Miyagi}}.\n\nThe name \"J\u014dban\" is derived from the names of the former [[province]]s of [[Hitachi Province|Hitachi]] ('''\u5e38'''\u9678) and [[Iwaki Province (1868)|Iwaki]] ('''\u78d0'''\u57ce), which are connected by the line to reach Tokyo.\n\nThe section of the J\u014dban Line between [[Tomioka Station|Tomioka]] and [[Namie Station|Namie]], which extends through the exclusion zone surrounding the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear meltdown, closed in the wake of the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]] and [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]], but was reopened on 14 March 2020.<ref name=\"nhk20161210\">{{cite web|url=https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20161210_15/ |title=Tsunami-hit railway line partially reopens - News - NHK WORLD - English |publisher=.nhk.or.jp |date= |accessdate=2016-12-10}}</ref>\n\n==Basic data==\n*Operators, distances:\n**[[East Japan Railway Company]] (JR East) (Services and tracks)\n***Nippori \u2013 Haranomachi \u2013 Iwanuma: {{convert|343.1|km|mi|1|abbr=on}}\n***Mikawashima \u2013 Sumidagawa \u2013 Minami-Senju (Sumidagawa freight branch): {{convert|5.7|km|mi|1|abbr=on}}\n***Mikawashima \u2013 Tabata (Tabata freight branch): {{convert|1.6|km|mi|1|abbr=on}}\n**[[Japan Freight Railway Company]] (JR Freight) (Services)\n***Mikawashima \u2013 Haranomachi \u2013 Iwanuma: {{convert|341.9|km|mi|1|abbr=on}}\n***Mikawashima \u2013 Sumidagawa \u2013 Minami-Senju (Sumidagawa freight branch): {{convert|5.7|km|mi|1|abbr=on}}\n***Mikawashima \u2013 Tabata (Tabata freight branch): {{convert|1.6|km|mi|1|abbr=on}}\n*Double/quadruple tracking:\n**Quadruple: Ayase \u2013 Toride\n**Double: Nippori \u2013 Ayase, Toride \u2013 Yotsukura, Hirono \u2013 Kido, \u014cno \u2013 Futaba\n*[[List of current systems for electric rail traction|Electrification]]:\n**1,500 V DC: Nippori \u2013 Toride, Mikawashima \u2013 Sumidagawa \u2013 Minami-Senju, Mikawashima \u2013 Tabata\n**20 kV AC, 50&nbsp;Hz: Fujishiro \u2013 Iwanuma.

This service is created to compete with the neighbouring railway line, the Tsukuba Express.\n\n====Shinagawa \u2013 Ueno \u2013 Mito \u2013 Katsuta====\nTrains that run beyond Toride are distinctly referred to as the '''J\u014dban Line \u5e38\u78d0\u7dda''', without the term \"Rapid\". Trains that are called J\u014dban Line (Rapid) cannot go beyond Toride, as their rolling stock cannot be powered by alternating current, which is the type of electrification that the section uses.\n\nThis section is mainly served by local trains.\n\n*{{Color box|#3333ff}} '''Local (\u666e\u901a)''' : These trains stop at every station north of Toride. Hence the name \"local\". There are two types of local trains:\n**'''Medium distance''' : These medium distance trains, as mentioned above, operate from central Tokyo to north of Toride and stop at all stations there. They terminate at various stations, namely Tsuchiura, [[Mito Station (Ibaraki)|Mito]] and [[Katsuta Station|Katsuta]].\n***{{Color box|Red}} '''Special Rapid (\u7279\u5225\u5feb\u901f)''' : Special Rapid trains stop at every station between Toride and Tsuchiura, so they're essentially the same as the medium distance trains, but become a different service once past south of Toride.\n** '''Mito Line through service''' : These trains run through services to the [[Mito Line]] via [[Tomobe Station]], operating from [[Oyama Station|Oyama]] to [[Katsuta Station|Katsuta]].\n\n====Mito \u2013 Iwaki====\nThis section is mainly served by local trains.\n\n*{{Color box|#3333ff}} '''Local (\u666e\u901a)''' : These trains stop at every station, operating between Mito and Takahagi / Iwaki\n**'''Medium distance / through service''': In early morning and late night, few medium distance trains and Mito Line through trains operate to as far as [[Takahagi Station|Takahagi]], which is located about mid-way in this section.\n\n===Iwaki \u2013 Sendai===\nBefore the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]] and the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]], local trains and limited express trains used to run across the entire section. However, due to the damages caused after the disaster, the section between Tomioka to Harunomachi had to be closed down, and services were suspended. After certain sections of the line were reconstructed, regular services were gradually allowed to resume.\n\n====Iwaki \u2013 Tomioka====\nThis section is served by local service trains. Trains cannot continue on beyond Tomioka as they once did, because the section beyond is closed (explained below).\n\n====Tomioka \u2013 Namie====\nThis section, which extends through the exclusion zone surrounding the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear meltdown, was suspended after the 2011 disaster. This section re-opened on 14 March 2020.<ref name=\"nhk20161210\" /> Prior to this date, services were provided by an interim bus service.\n\n====Namie \u2013 Sendai====\nThis section is served by local service trains, which serves the Greater Sendai area.\n\nThe section was once partially closed due to the 2011 disaster, but has since reopened in stages. The reconstructed segment between [[Hamayoshida Station|Hamayoshida]] and [[S\u014dma Station|S\u014dma]] was reopened on 10 December 2016, prior to which services were provided by an interim bus service.<ref>JR East press release: {{cite web|url=http://www.jrmito.com/press/111214/20111214_press03.pdf|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130121543/http://www.jrmito.com/press/111214/20111214_press03.pdf|archivedate=2012-01-30|url-status=dead|accessdate=2016-03-14|df=}}</ref><ref>Hongo, Jun, \"[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120311f1.html A year on, Tohoku stuck in limbo]\", ''[[The Japan Times]]'', 11 March 2012, p. 1.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jrmito.com/eq/index.html|title=\u6c34\u6238\u99c5\u30fb\u5e38\u78d0\u7dda\uff5cJR\u6771\u65e5\u672c\u65c5\u5ba2\u9244\u9053\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e \u6c34\u6238\u652f\u793e\uff5c\u6771\u65e5\u672c\u5927\u9707\u707d\u306b\u3088\u308b\u5217\u8eca\u5f71\u97ff\u3068\u904b\u8ee2\u898b\u8fbc\u307f\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066|date=|publisher=Jrmito.com|accessdate=2016-12-10}}</ref> JR East is currently inspecting the segment between [[Namie Station|Namie]] and Odaka in preparation for the surrounding areas being cleared for re-settlement.<ref>http://www.jreast.co.jp/pdf/damage03.pdf</ref> Train services between Namie and Odaka resumed on 1 April 2017.<ref name=\"mainichi.jp\">{{cite news|url=http://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20170401/p2a/00m/0na/020000c|title=Photo Journal: All aboard|author=|date=1 April 2017|newspaper=Mainichi Daily News|accessdate=21 March 2018}}</ref> Train services between Tatsuta and [[Tomioka Station|Tomioka]] resumed on 21 October 2017.<ref name=\"jt20171021\">{{cite news|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/10/21/national/7-km-part-joban-line-reopens-fukushima/|date=21 October 2017|language=English|title=7-km part of Joban Line reopens in Fukushima|accessdate=21 October 2017|newspaper=The Japan Times Online}}</ref>\n\n==Station list==\n[[File:\u5e38\u78d0\u7dda\u505c\u8eca\u99c5.png|1200px]]\n*The above is a diagram indicating J\u014dban Line service patterns within Greater Tokyo.\n*For more information on limited express services (i.e.''[[Hitachi (Japanese train)|Hitachi]]'' and ''[[Tokiwa (train)|Tokiwa]]''), see their respective pages.\n\n===Shinagawa \u2013 Ueno \u2013 Mito \u2013 Iwaki===\n;

The dates of the individual section openings are given below. After the line was nationalised in 1906, a program of double-tracking commenced in 1910, with the 219&nbsp;km section between Nippori and Yotsukura completed in 1925. The Hirono - Kido and Ono - Futaba sections were double-tracked in 1976.\n\nThe first section electrified was Nippori - Matsudo (at 1,500 V DC) in 1936, and extended to Toride in 1949. The Toride - Kusano section was electrified at 20 kV AC between 1961 and 1963, and extended to Iwanumi in 1967.\n\nThe [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]] caused severe disruption to the line, with services to Iwaki (209.4&nbsp;km from Nippori) re-established by 17 April, to Yotsukura (a further 9.8&nbsp;km) by 14 May, and to Hirono (another 13.2&nbsp;km) by 10 October 2011.

Intended to serve as infantry, its personnel were largely drawn from surplus ''Luftwaffe'' (German Air Force) ground crew. The division included four battalions of infantry, as well as artillery, engineer and signal units although it lacked a regimental staff. After training was completed in December 1942 it was sent to [[Army Group North]] as part of the [[18th Army (Wehrmacht)|18th Army]] although still under ''Luftwaffe'' command. Stationed near [[Novgorod]], it was transferred to the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Army]] in December 1943.

The quay is situated upstream from the mouth of the [[Singapore River]] and [[Boat Quay]].\n\n==Etymology==\n'''''Clarke Quay''''' was named after Sir [[Andrew Clarke (British Army officer, born 1824)|Andrew Clarke]], Singapore's second Governor and [[Governor of the Straits Settlements]] from 1873 to 1875, who played a key role in positioning Singapore as the main port for the [[British Malaya|Malay]] states of [[Perak]], Selangor and [[Sungei Ujong]]. \n\nClarke Quay is also the name of a road along the quay, part of which has since been converted into a [[pedestrian mall]]. Clarke Street, located next to Clarke Quay, was officially named in 1896, and was originally two streets known simply as East Street and West Street in north Kampong Malacca. Similar to Clarke Quay, Clarke Street has since been converted into a pedestrian mall.\n\nThe [[Hoklo (ethnic group)|Hoklo]]s (Hokkien) refer to Clarke Street as ''gi hok kong si au'' (\u4e49\u798f\u516c\u53f8\u540e), meaning \"behind the new Gi Hok Kongsi\" (house). The new Gi Hok Kongsi was near [[Carpenter Street, Singapore|Carpenter Street]]. Another Chinese reference, which only refers to the Southern bank around Read Bridge area, was ''cha chun tau'' (\u67f4\u8239\u5934), meaning \"[[jetty]] for boats carrying [[firewood]]\". Small ''[[tongkang]]s'' carrying firewood from [[Indonesia]] berthed at this jetty. The firewood trade was primarily a [[Chaozhou|Teochew]] enterprise.\n\n{{wide image|Clarke Quay Panorama, Feb 06.jpg|600px|Panoramic view of [[Singapore River]], with Clarke Quay on the left (northern) bank and Riverside Point on the right (southern) bank. Photograph taken from [[Ord Bridge]], which can be seen on the extreme right.}}\n\n==History==\nThe Singapore River has been the centre of trade since modern Singapore was founded in 1819. During the colonial era, Boat Quay was the commercial centre where [[lighter (barge)|barge lighters]] would transport goods upstream to [[warehouse]]s at Clarke Quay. \n\nAt the height of its prosperity, dozens of [[bumboat]]s jostled for [[wikt:mooring|mooring]] space beside Clarke Quay. This continued well into the later half of the 20th century. By this time, the Singapore River had also become very [[water pollution|polluted]]. The government decided to relocate cargo services to a new modern facility in [[Pasir Panjang]]. The bumboats and [[truck|lorries]] departed to their new home and Clarke Quay fell silent.\n\nThe government then cleaned up the Singapore River and its environment from 1977 to 1987. Plans were made to revamp the area and turn it into a flourishing commercial, residential and entertainment precinct. These plans took into serious consideration the historical value of Clarke Quay, making it mandatory that new buildings complement the historical character of the area and that certain old buildings be restored.\n\n[[File:Clarke Quay 44, Feb 06.JPG|thumb|upright|leftG-MAX [[reverse bungee]]]]\nClarke Quay Festival Village, the biggest [[Historic preservation|conservation]] project for the Singapore River, was developed and officially opened on 10 December 1993. In later years, Clarke Quay was managed and owned by [[CapitaLand]]. \n\nIn 1996, the advertising agency [[Saatchi & Saatchi]], and their sister company Zenith, moved into Clarke Quay as the pioneers to develop a creative hub. Two years later, they were awarded [[Ad Age]] International Agency of the Year. They had taken over the karaoke Party Doll premises. \n\nTen years later, works were commenced to revamp the Clarke Quay area to give the place a better [[leasehold estate|tenant]] mix. The development also saw major changes to the exterior and riverside areas. \n\nAlsop Architects an International Architecture practice was commissioned to redesign the shophouse facades, streetscapes and riverfront dining areas in two development phases. The newly redeveloped Clarke Quay consistently attracts over 2 million visitors a year and is a major social and tourist component of brand Singapore. Crucial to its success is the ingenious moderation of the micro-climate through the design of sophisticated shading and cooling systems which reduce the ambient temperature by 4 degrees Celsius while enhancing the riverfront and streets with tremendous visual interests. The project won in 2007 Cityscape Architectural Review Award (Tourism, Travel & Transport \u2013 Built) and the Cityscape Asia Awards, Best Waterfront Development in 2008.\n\nThe [[Satay]] Club and a number of establishments vacated Clarke Quay to make way for new tenants. The upgraded Clarke Quay features the [[Zirca]], The Clinic, Forbidden City by the [[Indochine Group]] and the whole development was completed in October 2006.\n\nThe Clarke Quay area at present is drastically different from the preservation/conservation effort from 1993.\n\n==Today==\n[[File:Clarke Quay 9, Feb 06.JPG|thumb|Clarke Quay today]]\n[[File:Clarke Quay, Singapore, at night - 20150308.jpg|thumb|Clarke Quay at night]]\nAt present, five blocks of restored warehouses house various restaurants and [[nightclub]]s.

It was initially fought between [[Raja Abdullah bin Raja Jaafar]], the administrator of [[Klang, Malaysia|Klang]], and [[Raja Mahadi bin Raja Sulaiman]]. It was joined by [[Tengku Kudin]] (Tengku Dhiauddin, also spelt Ziauddin), as well as Malay and Chinese rival factions.  The war was eventually won by Tengku Kudin and Abdullah's son, Raja Ismail.\n\n==Background==\nIn 1854, the sultan of Selangor [[Muhammad Shah of Selangor|Sultan Muhammad Shah]] appointed Raja Abdullah bin Raja Ja'afar as [[Klang Valley|Klang district]]'s administrator. Raja Abdullah and his brother Raja Juma'at had previously helped Raja Sulaiman pay a debt incurred during a failed mining venture, and was therefore rewarded with the chieftainship of Klang.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Story of Kuala Lumpur, 1857-1939 |author= [[J.M.

On Raja Mahdi side were Raja Mahmud, son of the [[Panglima]] Raja of Selangor; Raja Hitam of Bernam; groups of Sumatran settlers led by Mohamed Akib and his younger brother Nonggok (also known as Haji Mohamed Tahir and was conferred the title of 'Dato Dagang'). Raja Abdullah's faction included his son, [[Raja Ismail bin Raja Abdullah|Raja Ismail]] who continued the war after Raja Abdullah's death, later joined by Tengku Kudin and supported by the Sultan of Selangor.  The Chinese tin miners were also divided between the two camps.\n\nSome of the Malays however switched sides in the course of the war: for example  the Dato Dagang Haji Mohamed Tahir who helped Raja Mahadi capture Klang from Raja Abdullah eventually switched to Tengku Kudin's side (the Batu Bara Malays were originally on Raja Abdullah's side but switched to Raja Mahadi's side just before his fight against Raja Abdullah); [[Syarif Masahor|Syed Mashhor]], an Arab-Malay fighter from [[Pontianak, Indonesia|Pontianak]] was originally on Raja Abdullah's side but switched to that of Raja Mahdi; and Raja Muda Musa of Kuala Selangor also went over to Raja Mahdi's side. In the later stages Tengku Kudin gained the support of British colonial administrators and fighters from [[Pahang]].\n\n==Initial conflict==\n[[File:SMS0634 Klang MPK Kota Raja Mahdi 1293 side s.jpg|thumb|The entrance gate of the old fort of Raja Mahadi in Klang  built in 1866 as a defense against Raja Abdullah. Today only the main gate and the earthen ramparts remain of the fort.]]\nIn 1866, Raja Abdullah leased Klang to two traders from the Straits Settlements: [[William Henry Macleod Read]] and [[Tan Kim Ching]]. Among the benefits of the lease was tax collection from the opium trade, in which Raja Mahdi was involved.<ref name=tan />  When the two traders went out to collect tax, including from Raja Mahdi himself, he was offended as he felt he should be exempted from the tax since he was of Selangor royalty, and refused to pay.<ref name=\"gullick\"/> Raja Abdullah saw this as an act of defiance by Raja Mahadi towards him. This incident, exacerbated by Raja Mahadi's continued dissatisfaction with being ignored as the successor to Sultan Muhammad for the Selangor throne following his death in 1857 in favour of the then Raja Abdul Samad (later became Sultan Abdul Samad), and further conflicts between their followers worsened the already tense relationship between the two antagonists, which many believe were the initial causes for the outbreak of the Klang War.\n\nAt that time there was also a long-standing animosity between the [[Bugis]] Malays (the [[Sultan of Selangor|Selangor royal family]] were of Bugis origin) and the [[Sumatra]]n Batu Bara ethnic groups. Raja Abdullah, also a Bugis, refused to punish a member of the [[Bugis]] Malays he had sent to guard [[Bukit Nanas]] who then murdered a villager from the Batu Bara ethnic group. Angered by Raja Abdullah's refusal to take action against the murderer nor pay compensation for the death of one of his men as an alternative, the Batu Bara Malays' leader Mohamed Akib, informed Raja Mahdi of the incident and offered his support for him if he wanted to fight against Raja Abdullah.<ref>{{cite web |title=Raja Mahadi Fort (Kota Raja Mahadi) |url=http://sejarahmalaysia.pnm.my/portalBI/detail.php?section=sm04&spesifik_id=359&ttl_id=51 |year=2000 |work= |publisher=Perpustakaan Negara Malaysia |accessdate=25 June 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031116080132/http://sejarahmalaysia.pnm.my/portalBI/detail.php?section=sm04&spesifik_id=359&ttl_id=51 |archivedate=16 November 2003 }}</ref>  Raja Mahdi, supported by the Sumatran traders, then laid siege to the fort of Klang (now known as Raja Mahadi fort).  Mohamad Akib however was shot and killed in 1867 while fighting at the fort, and his younger brother Haji Mohamed Tahir assumed leadership. Mohamad Akib's body together with several other slain Sumatran Malays were buried within the grounds of the fort, whose graves still remain there to this day. \n\nRaja Abdullah evacuated with his family to [[Malacca]], where he later died, while his two sons, Raja Ismail and Raja Hasan continued with the fighting. In March 1867, Raja Mahdi gained possession of the fort and control of Klang.  One of Abdullah's sons, Raja Ismail, returned with three small ships to lay siege to Raja Mahdi, but was unable to take Klang.<ref name=\"gullick\" />\n\n==Chinese ''Kongsi'' Involvement==\nWhen the [[Selangor Civil War]] broke out, [[Kapitan Cina]] of Kuala Lumpur [[Yap Ah Loy]] was faced with internecine fighting among dissident Chinese groups as well as attacks from [[Malay people|Malay]] factions.

Offended by this, Tengku Kudin sided with Raja Ismail instead. Meanwhile antagonism between the Dato Dagang and Raja Mahadi arose due to the latter's refusal to fulfill the reward promised to him for his support in his fight against Raja Abdullah. Raja Mahadi had promised to grant the Dato Dagang power over all the interior of Selangor should he win the war against Raja Abdullah. However after his victory over Raja Abdullah, nothing was granted to the Dato Dagang and to make things worse, a relative of Raja Mahadi had killed one of the Dato's followers in a scuffle. The Dato Dagang demanded that justice be done upon the perpetrator according to the 'adat ganti darah' (blood money) Malay custom, but Raja Mahadi ignored his requests. As a result, Dato Dagang withdrew his support for Raja Mahadi, and indicated to Tengku Kudin of his willingness to be on his side against Raja Mahadi, which Tengku Kudin gladly accepted. The Dato Dagang also informed Tengku Kudin (and Sultan Abdul Samad) that he was able, through his contacts in Singapore, to supply them weapons and ammunition in their fight against Raja Mahadi.\n\nIn March 1870, Raja Ismail with help from Tengku Kudin besieged Klang, defeating Raja Mahadi, who retreated to Kuala Selangor, which he captured from Raja Musa with help from Raja Hitam. Syed Mashhor, who served under Tengku Kudin, was sent to Kuala Selangor to help Raja Musa but switched sides after learning that his brother had been killed by a son of the Sultan.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://yapahloy.tripod.com/the_defection_of_syed_mashhor.htm |title=The Defection of Syed Mashhor |work=The History of Yap Ah Loy }}</ref>  Raja Mahadi allied with Chinese in Kanching who were enemies of Yap, then attacked Kuala Lumpur in 1870 with the Malay forces led by Syed Mashhor, and again in 1871, but both attacks were unsuccessful.<ref name=\"yap\" /><ref name=\"carstens\" />\n\nMeanwhile, with disruption to the economy and trade in the British [[Straits Settlements]], and concerns over security especially occurrences of piracy, the British became increasingly involved in the affairs of Selangor.  In July 1871, due to an attack by pirates that was traced to Raja Mahadi's stronghold Kuala Selangor, the British attacked and captured Kuala Selangor, drove Mahadi's men out and handed the town to Tengku Kudin.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sabrizain.org/malaya/sgor.htm |title=The Selangor Civil War |work=Sejarah Melayu}}</ref> Kudin however refused to yield control of revenue from the town to Raja Musa who had previously ruled Kuala Selangor, which prompted Raja Musa to join Mahadi's side.  The Sultan of Selangor, who had bestowed [[Kuala Langat|Langat]] upon Tengku Kudin to help him fund his war, also began to be concerned about the rising power of Tengku Kudin.<ref name=tan />\n\n==End of war==\n[[File:CO 1069-484-124 (7886266562).jpg|thumb|upright|Tengku Dhiauddin's Secretariat.]]\n\nIn 1872, Raja Mahadi gained the support of a number of Malay chiefs, some of them members of Selangor Royal family.  Leaders of [[Mandailing people|Mandailing]] settlers in Selangor, Raja Asal and Sutan Puasa, also switched their support to Raja Mahadi's side.  Raja Mahadi's forces attacked Kuala Lumpur, and Raja Asal laid siege to [[Bukit Nanas]] where Tengku Kudin's forces of 500 soldiers and various [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] including [[Europe]]ans were stationed. The siege forced Tengku Kudin's men to try to escape, but they were captured in Petaling and killed. Yap Ah Loy managed to escape to Klang, but Kuala Lumpur was razed to the ground and Kuala Selangor was captured by Raja Mahadi's forces.  \n\nYap however was determined to recapture Kuala Lumpur, and assembled a force of around 1,000 men.  Tengku Kudin sent a request for help to the Sultan of Pahang in 1872, and the [[Bendahara]] Wan Ahmad of Pahang sent him 1,000 men and other reserves in response. He also gained the support of the [[British Empire|British]] colonial administrator [[Andrew Clarke (British Army officer, born 1824)|Sir Andrew Clarke]].  In March 1873, Kudin's men supported by Pahang fighters defeated Syed Mashhor in Kuala Lumpur, and Mashhor had to flee to Perak.<ref name=\"gullick\"/> The fighting went on for a few more months, but on 8 November 1873 the Pahang forces captured Kuala Selangor and the war largely ended.  In 1874 Raja Mahadi was forced to leave for Johore and then Singapore, where he died in 1882.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Story of Kuala Lumpur, 1857-1939 |author= [[J.M.

Tengku Kudin's army from Pahang also refused to return to Pahang because they wanted to collect tax as payment for their service, and their refusal to leave made the situation worse for Tengku Kudin.  The leader of the Pahang forces was allowed to collect the revenue of Kuala Selangor and Klang, while  J. G. Davidson and others who helped funded Tengku Kudin were given favourable concession on mining land for ten years in Selangor.<ref name=tan />  While the British through the new Governor Andrew Clarke was on Tengku Kudin's side, the post-war situation had weakened Tengku Kudin's support.

The British were concerned about the disruption caused by the war to their trade and investments in the region, eventually siding with Tengku Kudin, in part because Mahdi and some of his followers had attacked shipping in the Straits. Colonial Secretary [[James W. W. Birch]] voiced his support for Tengku Kudin and lent him a ship to blockade Kuala Selangor, and Governor Sir [[Harry Ord]] also encouraged Pahang to back Tengku Kudin with fighters.<ref name=\"yap\"/> Previously the British had a policy of non-intervention even though they had at times become engaged in local disputes. This war and other conflicts such as the [[Larut War]] in Perak led to the official abandonment of this policy in September 1873 by the [[John Wodehouse, 1st Earl of Kimberley|Earl of Kimberley]], [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]], and set into motion the beginning of British administration in the Malay States.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Portrait of Malaysia and Singapore |author=Tan Ding Eing|pages=122\u2013124 |publisher=Oxford University Press |date= 1975  |isbn= 978-0195807226}}</ref>\n\nIn 1875, Sultan Abdul Samad accepted [[James Guthrie Davidson]], a lawyer from [[Singapore]], as the first [[British Resident]] of Selangor.

On Raja Mahdi side were Raja Mahmud, son of the [[Panglima]] Raja of Selangor; Raja Hitam of Bernam; groups of Sumatran settlers led by Mohamed Akib and his younger brother Nonggok (also known as Haji Mohamed Tahir and was conferred the title of 'Dato Dagang'). Raja Abdullah's faction included his son, [[Raja Ismail bin Raja Abdullah|Raja Ismail]] who continued the war after Raja Abdullah's death, later joined by Tengku Kudin and supported by the Sultan of Selangor.  The Chinese tin miners were also divided between the two camps.\n\nSome of the Malays however switched sides in the course of the war: for example  the Dato Dagang Haji Mohamed Tahir who helped Raja Mahadi capture Klang from Raja Abdullah eventually switched to Tengku Kudin's side (the Batu Bara Malays were originally on Raja Abdullah's side but switched to Raja Mahadi's side just before his fight against Raja Abdullah); [[Syarif Masahor|Syed Mashhor]], an Arab-Malay fighter from [[Pontianak, Indonesia|Pontianak]] was originally on Raja Abdullah's side but switched to that of Raja Mahdi; and Raja Muda Musa of Kuala Selangor also went over to Raja Mahdi's side. In the later stages Tengku Kudin gained the support of British colonial administrators and fighters from [[Pahang]].\n\n==Initial conflict==\n[[File:SMS0634 Klang MPK Kota Raja Mahdi 1293 side s.jpg|thumb|The entrance gate of the old fort of Raja Mahadi in Klang  built in 1866 as a defense against Raja Abdullah. Today only the main gate and the earthen ramparts remain of the fort.]]\nIn 1866, Raja Abdullah leased Klang to two traders from the Straits Settlements: [[William Henry Macleod Read]] and [[Tan Kim Ching]]. Among the benefits of the lease was tax collection from the opium trade, in which Raja Mahdi was involved.<ref name=tan />  When the two traders went out to collect tax, including from Raja Mahdi himself, he was offended as he felt he should be exempted from the tax since he was of Selangor royalty, and refused to pay.<ref name=\"gullick\"/> Raja Abdullah saw this as an act of defiance by Raja Mahadi towards him. This incident, exacerbated by Raja Mahadi's continued dissatisfaction with being ignored as the successor to Sultan Muhammad for the Selangor throne following his death in 1857 in favour of the then Raja Abdul Samad (later became Sultan Abdul Samad), and further conflicts between their followers worsened the already tense relationship between the two antagonists, which many believe were the initial causes for the outbreak of the Klang War.\n\nAt that time there was also a long-standing animosity between the [[Bugis]] Malays (the [[Sultan of Selangor|Selangor royal family]] were of Bugis origin) and the [[Sumatra]]n Batu Bara ethnic groups. Raja Abdullah, also a Bugis, refused to punish a member of the [[Bugis]] Malays he had sent to guard [[Bukit Nanas]] who then murdered a villager from the Batu Bara ethnic group. Angered by Raja Abdullah's refusal to take action against the murderer nor pay compensation for the death of one of his men as an alternative, the Batu Bara Malays' leader Mohamed Akib, informed Raja Mahdi of the incident and offered his support for him if he wanted to fight against Raja Abdullah.<ref>{{cite web |title=Raja Mahadi Fort (Kota Raja Mahadi) |url=http://sejarahmalaysia.pnm.my/portalBI/detail.php?section=sm04&spesifik_id=359&ttl_id=51 |year=2000 |work= |publisher=Perpustakaan Negara Malaysia |accessdate=25 June 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031116080132/http://sejarahmalaysia.pnm.my/portalBI/detail.php?section=sm04&spesifik_id=359&ttl_id=51 |archivedate=16 November 2003 }}</ref>  Raja Mahdi, supported by the Sumatran traders, then laid siege to the fort of Klang (now known as Raja Mahadi fort).  Mohamad Akib however was shot and killed in 1867 while fighting at the fort, and his younger brother Haji Mohamed Tahir assumed leadership. Mohamad Akib's body together with several other slain Sumatran Malays were buried within the grounds of the fort, whose graves still remain there to this day. \n\nRaja Abdullah evacuated with his family to [[Malacca]], where he later died, while his two sons, Raja Ismail and Raja Hasan continued with the fighting.

Offended by this, Tengku Kudin sided with Raja Ismail instead. Meanwhile antagonism between the Dato Dagang and Raja Mahadi arose due to the latter's refusal to fulfill the reward promised to him for his support in his fight against Raja Abdullah. Raja Mahadi had promised to grant the Dato Dagang power over all the interior of Selangor should he win the war against Raja Abdullah. However after his victory over Raja Abdullah, nothing was granted to the Dato Dagang and to make things worse, a relative of Raja Mahadi had killed one of the Dato's followers in a scuffle. The Dato Dagang demanded that justice be done upon the perpetrator according to the 'adat ganti darah' (blood money) Malay custom, but Raja Mahadi ignored his requests. As a result, Dato Dagang withdrew his support for Raja Mahadi, and indicated to Tengku Kudin of his willingness to be on his side against Raja Mahadi, which Tengku Kudin gladly accepted. The Dato Dagang also informed Tengku Kudin (and Sultan Abdul Samad) that he was able, through his contacts in Singapore, to supply them weapons and ammunition in their fight against Raja Mahadi.\n\nIn March 1870, Raja Ismail with help from Tengku Kudin besieged Klang, defeating Raja Mahadi, who retreated to Kuala Selangor, which he captured from Raja Musa with help from Raja Hitam. Syed Mashhor, who served under Tengku Kudin, was sent to Kuala Selangor to help Raja Musa but switched sides after learning that his brother had been killed by a son of the Sultan.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://yapahloy.tripod.com/the_defection_of_syed_mashhor.htm |title=The Defection of Syed Mashhor |work=The History of Yap Ah Loy }}</ref>  Raja Mahadi allied with Chinese in Kanching who were enemies of Yap, then attacked Kuala Lumpur in 1870 with the Malay forces led by Syed Mashhor, and again in 1871, but both attacks were unsuccessful.<ref name=\"yap\" /><ref name=\"carstens\" />\n\nMeanwhile, with disruption to the economy and trade in the British [[Straits Settlements]], and concerns over security especially occurrences of piracy, the British became increasingly involved in the affairs of Selangor.  In July 1871, due to an attack by pirates that was traced to Raja Mahadi's stronghold Kuala Selangor, the British attacked and captured Kuala Selangor, drove Mahadi's men out and handed the town to Tengku Kudin.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sabrizain.org/malaya/sgor.htm |title=The Selangor Civil War |work=Sejarah Melayu}}</ref> Kudin however refused to yield control of revenue from the town to Raja Musa who had previously ruled Kuala Selangor, which prompted Raja Musa to join Mahadi's side.  The Sultan of Selangor, who had bestowed [[Kuala Langat|Langat]] upon Tengku Kudin to help him fund his war, also began to be concerned about the rising power of Tengku Kudin.<ref name=tan />\n\n==End of war==\n[[File:CO 1069-484-124 (7886266562).jpg|thumb|upright|Tengku Dhiauddin's Secretariat.]]\n\nIn 1872, Raja Mahadi gained the support of a number of Malay chiefs, some of them members of Selangor Royal family.  Leaders of [[Mandailing people|Mandailing]] settlers in Selangor, Raja Asal and Sutan Puasa, also switched their support to Raja Mahadi's side.  Raja Mahadi's forces attacked Kuala Lumpur, and Raja Asal laid siege to [[Bukit Nanas]] where Tengku Kudin's forces of 500 soldiers and various [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] including [[Europe]]ans were stationed. The siege forced Tengku Kudin's men to try to escape, but they were captured in Petaling and killed. Yap Ah Loy managed to escape to Klang, but Kuala Lumpur was razed to the ground and Kuala Selangor was captured by Raja Mahadi's forces.  \n\nYap however was determined to recapture Kuala Lumpur, and assembled a force of around 1,000 men.  Tengku Kudin sent a request for help to the Sultan of Pahang in 1872, and the [[Bendahara]] Wan Ahmad of Pahang sent him 1,000 men and other reserves in response. He also gained the support of the [[British Empire|British]] colonial administrator [[Andrew Clarke (administrator)|Sir Andrew Clarke]].  In March 1873, Kudin's men supported by Pahang fighters defeated Syed Mashhor in Kuala Lumpur, and Mashhor had to flee to Perak.<ref name=\"gullick\"/> The fighting went on for a few more months, but on 8 November 1873 the Pahang forces captured Kuala Selangor and the war largely ended.  In 1874 Raja Mahadi was forced to leave for Johore and then Singapore, where he died in 1882.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Story of Kuala Lumpur, 1857-1939 |author= [[J.M.

Tengku Kudin's army from Pahang also refused to return to Pahang because they wanted to collect tax as payment for their service, and their refusal to leave made the situation worse for Tengku Kudin.  The leader of the Pahang forces was allowed to collect the revenue of Kuala Selangor and Klang, while  J. G.

The British were concerned about the disruption caused by the war to their trade and investments in the region, eventually siding with Tengku Kudin, in part because Mahdi and some of his followers had attacked shipping in the Straits. Colonial Secretary [[James W. W. Birch]] voiced his support for Tengku Kudin and lent him a ship to blockade Kuala Selangor, and Governor Sir [[Harry Ord]] also encouraged Pahang to back Tengku Kudin with fighters.<ref name=\"yap\"/> Previously the British had a policy of non-intervention even though they had at times become engaged in local disputes. This war and other conflicts such as the [[Larut War]] in Perak led to the official abandonment of this policy in September 1873 by the [[John Wodehouse, 1st Earl of Kimberley|Earl of Kimberley]], [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]], and set into motion the beginning of British administration in the Malay States.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Portrait of Malaysia and Singapore |author=Tan Ding Eing|pages=122\u2013124 |publisher=Oxford University Press |date= 1975  |isbn= 978-0195807226}}</ref>\n\nIn 1875, Sultan Abdul Samad accepted [[James Guthrie Davidson]], a lawyer from [[Singapore]], as the first [[British Resident]] of Selangor.

The classical definition, described but not ultimately endorsed by [[Plato]],<ref>In Plato's ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'', Socrates and Theaetetus discuss three definitions of ''knowledge'': knowledge as nothing but perception, knowledge as true judgment, and, finally, knowledge as a true judgment with an account.

Some claim that these conditions are not sufficient, as [[Gettier case]] examples allegedly demonstrate. There are a number of alternatives proposed, including [[Robert Nozick]]'s arguments for a requirement that knowledge 'tracks the truth' and [[Simon Blackburn]]'s additional requirement that we do not want to say that those who meet any of these conditions 'through a defect, flaw, or failure' have knowledge. [[Richard Kirkham]] suggests that our definition of knowledge requires that the evidence for the belief necessitates its truth.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Does the Gettier Problem Rest on a Mistake? |first1=Richard L. |last1=Kirkham |journal=Mind |series=New Series |volume=93 |number=372 |date=October 1984 |pages=501\u2013513 |jstor=2254258 }} [[jstor]] {{subscription}}{{Dead link|date=November 2016}}<!-- the pdf link is the dead one --></ref>\n\nIn contrast to this approach, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] observed, following [[Moore's paradox]], that one can say \"He believes it, but it isn't so,\" but not \"He knows it, but it isn't so.\"<ref>Ludwig Wittgenstein, ''[[On Certainty]]'', remark 42</ref> He goes on to argue that these do not correspond to distinct mental states, but rather to distinct ways of talking about conviction. What is different here is not the mental state of the speaker, but the activity in which they are engaged. For example, on this account, to ''know'' that the kettle is boiling is not to be in a particular state of mind, but to perform a particular task with the statement that the kettle is boiling. Wittgenstein sought to bypass the difficulty of definition by looking to the way \"knowledge\" is used in natural languages. He saw knowledge as a case of a [[family resemblance]]. Following this idea, \"knowledge\" has been reconstructed as a cluster concept that points out relevant features but that is not adequately captured by any definition.<ref>Gottschalk-Mazouz, N.

Hence the transfer of the symbolic representation can be viewed as one [[wikt:ascription|ascription]] process whereby knowledge can be transferred. Other forms of communication include observation and imitation, verbal exchange, and audio and video recordings. Philosophers of language and [[semiotician]]s construct and analyze theories of knowledge transfer or communication.\n\nWhile many would agree that one of the most universal and significant tools for the transfer of knowledge is writing and reading (of many kinds), argument over the usefulness of the written word exists nonetheless, with some scholars skeptical of its impact on societies. In his collection of essays ''[[Technopoly: the Surrender of Culture to Technology|Technopoly]]'', [[Neil Postman]] demonstrates the argument against the use of writing through an excerpt from Plato's work ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'' (Postman, Neil (1992) ''Technopoly'', Vintage, New York, p.&nbsp;73). In this excerpt, the scholar [[Socrates]] recounts the story of Thamus, the Egyptian king and Theuth the inventor of the written word.

It was used by [[Donna Haraway]] as an extension of the [[Feminism|feminist]] approaches of \"successor science\" suggested by [[Sandra Harding]], one which \"offers a more adequate, richer, better account of a world, in order to live in it well and in critical, reflexive relation to our own as well as others' practices of domination and the unequal parts of privilege and oppression that makes up all positions.\"<ref name=\"Haraway1988\">\"[https://philpapers.org/archive/HARSKT.pdf Situated Knowledges: The Science Question in Feminism and the Privilege of Partial Perspective]\".

''Feminist Studies'' Vol. 14, No. 3. pp. 575\u2013599. 1988.</ref> This situation partially transforms science into a [[narrative]], which [[Arturo Escobar (anthropologist)|Arturo Escobar]] explains as, \"neither fictions nor supposed facts.\" This narrative of situation is historical textures woven of fact and fiction, and as Escobar explains further, \"even the most neutral scientific domains are narratives in this sense,\" insisting that rather than a purpose dismissing science as a trivial matter of contingency, \"it is to treat (this narrative) in the most serious way, without succumbing to its mystification as 'the truth' or to the ironic [[skepticism]] common to many critiques.\"<ref>\"Introduction: Development and the Anthropology of Modernity\". Escobar, Arturo. ''Encountering Development: The Making and Unmaking of the Third World''.</ref>\n\nHaraway's argument stems from the limitations of the [[human perception]], as well as the overemphasis of the [[Visual perception|sense of vision]] in [[science]]. According to Haraway, [[Visual perception|vision]] in [[science]] has been, \"used to signify a leap out of the marked body and into a conquering gaze from nowhere.\" This is the \"gaze that mythically inscribes all the marked bodies, that makes the unmarked category claim the power to see and not be seen, to represent while escaping representation.\"<ref name=\"Haraway1988\" /> This causes a limitation of views in the position of [[science]] itself as a potential player in the creation of knowledge, resulting in a position of \"modest witness\". This is what Haraway terms a \"god trick\", or the aforementioned representation while escaping representation.<ref>Chapter 1. Haraway, Donna. ''Modest_Witness@Second_Millennium.

Fundamentally, both argue the [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingency]] of knowledge on the presence of [[history]]; [[Power (social and political)|power]], and [[geography]], as well as the rejection of universal rules or laws or elementary structures; and the idea of [[Power (social and political)|power]] as an inherited trait of [[objectification]].<ref>\"The Subject and Power\".

In most cases, it is not possible to understand an information domain exhaustively; our knowledge is always ''incomplete'' or partial. Most real problems have to be solved by taking advantage of a partial understanding of the problem context and problem data, unlike the typical math problems one might solve at school, where all data is given and one is given a complete understanding of formulas necessary to solve them.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}\n\nThis idea is also present in the concept of [[bounded rationality]] which assumes that in real life situations people often have a limited amount of information and make decisions accordingly.\n\n== Scientific knowledge ==\n[[File:Francis Bacon 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Sir Francis Bacon]], \"[[Scientia potentia est|Knowledge is Power]]\"]]\nThe development of the [[scientific method]] has made a significant contribution to how knowledge of the physical world and its phenomena is acquired.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/science|title=Science \u2013 Definition of science by Merriam-Webster|work=merriam-webster.com}}</ref> To be termed scientific, a method of [[inquiry]] must be based on gathering [[observable]] and [[Measurement|measurable]] [[evidence]] subject to specific principles of [[reasoning]] and experimentation.<ref>\"[4] Rules for the study of [[natural philosophy]]\", {{harvnb|Newton|1999|pp=794\u2013796}}, from the [[General Scholium]], which follows Book '''3''', ''The System of the World''.</ref> The scientific method consists of the collection of [[data]] through [[observation]] and [[experiment]]ation, and the formulation and testing of [[hypotheses]].<ref>[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/scientific%20method scientific method], ''[[Merriam-Webster]] Dictionary''.</ref> Science, and the nature of scientific knowledge have also become the subject of [[Philosophy of science|philosophy]].

Note that \"[[epistemology]]\" is the study of knowledge and how it is acquired. Science is \"the process used everyday to logically complete thoughts through inference of facts determined by calculated experiments.\" [[Sir Francis Bacon]] was critical in the historical development of the scientific method; his works established and popularized an inductive methodology for scientific inquiry. His famous aphorism, \"[[Scientia potentia est|knowledge is power]]\", is found in the Meditations Sacrae (1597).<ref>{{cite web\n| title       = Sir Francis Bacon \u2013 Quotationspage.com\n| url         = http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/2060.html\n| accessdate  = 2009-07-08}}</ref>\n\nUntil recent times, at least in the Western tradition, it was simply taken for granted that knowledge was something possessed only by humans \u2013 and probably ''adult'' humans at that. Sometimes the notion might stretch to ''Society-as-such'', as in (e.&nbsp;g.) \"the knowledge possessed by the Coptic culture\" (as opposed to its individual members), but that was not assured either. Nor was it usual to consider ''unconscious'' knowledge in any systematic way until this approach was popularized by [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]].<ref>There is quite a good case for this exclusive specialization used by philosophers, in that it allows for in-depth study of logic-procedures and other abstractions which are not found elsewhere. However this may lead to problems whenever the topic spills over into those excluded domains \u2013 e.&nbsp;g. when Kant (following Newton) dismissed ''Space and Time'' as axiomatically \"transcendental\" and \"a priori\" \u2013 a claim later disproved by [[Jean Piaget|Piaget's]] clinical studies. It also seems likely that the vexed problem of \"''[[infinite regress]]''\" can be largely (but not completely) solved by proper attention to how unconscious concepts are ''actually'' developed, both during infantile learning ''and'' as inherited \"pseudo-transcendentals\" inherited from the trial-and-error of previous generations.

See the list of four \"epistemological domains\": [[Karl Popper|Popper]], (1975);<ref>[[Karl Popper|Popper, K.R.]] (1975). \"The rationality of scientific revolutions\"; in Rom Harr\u00e9 (ed.), ''Problems of Scientific Revolution: Scientific Progress and Obstacles to Progress in the Sciences''.

For biologists, knowledge must be usefully ''available'' to the system, though that system need not be conscious. Thus the criteria seem to be:\n* The system should apparently be dynamic and self-organizing (unlike a mere book ''on its own'').\n* The knowledge must constitute some sort of representation of \"the outside world\",<ref>This \"outside world\" could include other subsystems within the same organism \u2013 e.&nbsp;g. different \"mental levels\" corresponding to different Piagetian stages. See [[Theory of cognitive development]].</ref> or ways of dealing with it (directly or indirectly).\n* Some way must exist for the system to access this information quickly enough for it to be useful.\n\nScientific knowledge may not involve a claim to [[certainty]], maintaining [[skepticism]] means that a scientist will never be absolutely certain when they are correct and when they are not. It is thus an irony of proper [[scientific method]] that one must doubt even when correct, in the hopes that this practice will lead to greater convergence on the [[truth]] in general.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://philosophybites.com/2007/12/barry-stroud-on.html|title=philosophy bites|work=philosophybites.com}}</ref>\n\n== Religious meaning of knowledge ==\nIn many expressions of [[Christianity]], such as [[Catholicism]] and [[Anglicanism]], knowledge is one of the [[seven gifts of the Holy Spirit]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s1c1a7.htm#1831\n|title=Part Three, No. 1831\n|work=Catechism of the Catholic Church\n|accessdate=2007-04-20\n|url-status=dead\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504201314/http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s1c1a7.htm#1804#1831\n|archivedate=2007-05-04\n|df=\n}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Old Testament]]'s [[tree of the knowledge of good and evil]] contained the knowledge that separated Man from God: \"And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil...\" ({{bibleverse||Genesis|3:22|KJV}})\n\nIn [[Gnosticism]], divine knowledge or [[gnosis]] is hoped to be attained.\n\n\u0935\u093f\u0926\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0926\u093e\u0928 (Vidya Daan) i.e. [[knowledge sharing]] is a major part of [[D\u0101na|Daan]], a [[Niyama|tenet]] of all [[Indian religions|Dharmic Religions]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vhp.org/news/news-regional/delhi-seva|title=\u0935\u093f\u0926\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0926\u093e\u0928 \u0939\u0940 \u0938\u092c\u0938\u0947 \u092c\u0921\u093e \u0926\u093e\u0928 : \u0935\u093f\u0939\u093f\u092a \u2013 Vishva Hindu Parishad \u2013 Official Website|work=vhp.org|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820205238/http://vhp.org/news/news-regional/delhi-seva|archivedate=2011-08-20|df=}}</ref>\n[[Hindu]] Scriptures present two kinds of knowledge, ''Paroksh Gyan'' and ''Prataksh Gyan''.

There are a number of alternatives proposed, including [[Robert Nozick]]'s arguments for a requirement that knowledge 'tracks the truth' and [[Simon Blackburn]]'s additional requirement that we do not want to say that those who meet any of these conditions 'through a defect, flaw, or failure' have knowledge.

What is different here is not the mental state of the speaker, but the activity in which they are engaged. For example, on this account, to ''know'' that the kettle is boiling is not to be in a particular state of mind, but to perform a particular task with the statement that the kettle is boiling. Wittgenstein sought to bypass the difficulty of definition by looking to the way \"knowledge\" is used in natural languages. He saw knowledge as a case of a [[family resemblance]].

It was used by [[Donna Haraway]] as an extension of the [[Feminism|feminist]] approaches of \"successor science\" suggested by [[Sandra Harding]], one which \"offers a more adequate, richer, better account of a world, in order to live in it well and in critical, reflexive relation to our own as well as others' practices of domination and the unequal parts of privilege and oppression that makes up all positions.\"<ref name=\"Haraway1988\">\"[https://philpapers.org/archive/HARSKT.pdf Situated Knowledges: The Science Question in Feminism and the Privilege of Partial Perspective]\". Haraway, Donna. ''Feminist Studies'' Vol. 14, No. 3. pp. 575\u2013599. 1988.</ref> This situation partially transforms science into a [[narrative]], which [[Arturo Escobar (anthropologist)|Arturo Escobar]] explains as, \"neither fictions nor supposed facts.\" This narrative of situation is historical textures woven of fact and fiction, and as Escobar explains further, \"even the most neutral scientific domains are narratives in this sense,\" insisting that rather than a purpose dismissing science as a trivial matter of contingency, \"it is to treat (this narrative) in the most serious way, without succumbing to its mystification as 'the truth' or to the ironic [[skepticism]] common to many critiques.\"<ref>\"Introduction: Development and the Anthropology of Modernity\". Escobar, Arturo. ''Encountering Development: The Making and Unmaking of the Third World''.</ref>\n\nHaraway's argument stems from the limitations of the [[human perception]], as well as the overemphasis of the [[Visual perception|sense of vision]] in [[science]]. According to Haraway, [[Visual perception|vision]] in [[science]] has been, \"used to signify a leap out of the marked body and into a conquering gaze from nowhere.\" This is the \"gaze that mythically inscribes all the marked bodies, that makes the unmarked category claim the power to see and not be seen, to represent while escaping representation.\"<ref name=\"Haraway1988\" /> This causes a limitation of views in the position of [[science]] itself as a potential player in the creation of knowledge, resulting in a position of \"modest witness\". This is what Haraway terms a \"god trick\", or the aforementioned representation while escaping representation.<ref>Chapter 1. Haraway, Donna. ''Modest_Witness@Second_Millennium. FemaleMan\u00a9 Meets_OncoMouse2. Feminism and Technoscience''. 1997.</ref> In order to avoid this, \"Haraway perpetuates a tradition of thought which emphasizes the importance of the [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]] in terms of both ethical and political accountability\".<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1177/0263276406069232| title=Posthuman, All Too Human| journal=Theory, Culture & Society| volume=23| issue=7\u20138| pages=197\u2013208| year=2006| last1=Braidotti| first1=Rosi| doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nSome methods of generating knowledge, such as [[trial and error]], or learning from [[experience]], tend to create highly situational knowledge.\nSituational knowledge is often embedded in language, culture, or traditions. This integration of situational knowledge is an allusion to the community, and its attempts at collecting subjective perspectives into an embodiment \"of views from somewhere.\" <ref name=\"Haraway1988\" />\n\nEven though Haraway's arguments are largely based on [[Feminism|feminist studies]],<ref name=\"Haraway1988\" /> this idea of different worlds, as well as the [[Skepticism|skeptic]] stance of situated knowledge is present in the main arguments of [[post-structuralism]]. Fundamentally, both argue the [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingency]] of knowledge on the presence of [[history]]; [[Power (social and political)|power]], and [[geography]], as well as the rejection of universal rules or laws or elementary structures; and the idea of [[Power (social and political)|power]] as an inherited trait of [[objectification]].<ref>\"The Subject and Power\".

In most cases, it is not possible to understand an information domain exhaustively; our knowledge is always ''incomplete'' or partial. Most real problems have to be solved by taking advantage of a partial understanding of the problem context and problem data, unlike the typical math problems one might solve at school, where all data is given and one is given a complete understanding of formulas necessary to solve them.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}\n\nThis idea is also present in the concept of [[bounded rationality]] which assumes that in real life situations people often have a limited amount of information and make decisions accordingly.\n\n== Scientific knowledge ==\n[[File:Francis Bacon 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Sir Francis Bacon]], \"[[Scientia potentia est|Knowledge is Power]]\"]]\nThe development of the [[scientific method]] has made a significant contribution to how knowledge of the physical world and its phenomena is acquired.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/science|title=Science \u2013 Definition of science by Merriam-Webster|work=merriam-webster.com}}</ref> To be termed scientific, a method of [[inquiry]] must be based on gathering [[observable]] and [[Measurement|measurable]] [[evidence]] subject to specific principles of [[reasoning]] and experimentation.<ref>\"[4] Rules for the study of [[natural philosophy]]\", {{harvnb|Newton|1999|pp=794\u2013796}}, from the [[General Scholium]], which follows Book '''3''', ''The System of the World''.</ref> The scientific method consists of the collection of [[data]] through [[observation]] and [[experiment]]ation, and the formulation and testing of [[hypotheses]].<ref>[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/scientific%20method scientific method], ''[[Merriam-Webster]] Dictionary''.</ref> Science, and the nature of scientific knowledge have also become the subject of [[Philosophy of science|Philosophy]].

Note that \"[[epistemology]]\" is the study of knowledge and how it is acquired. Science is \"the process used everyday to logically complete thoughts through inference of facts determined by calculated experiments.\" [[Sir Francis Bacon]] was critical in the historical development of the scientific method; his works established and popularized an inductive methodology for scientific inquiry. His famous aphorism, \"[[Scientia potentia est|knowledge is power]]\", is found in the Meditations Sacrae (1597).<ref>{{cite web\n| title       = Sir Francis Bacon \u2013 Quotationspage.com\n| url         = http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/2060.html\n| accessdate  = 2009-07-08}}</ref>\n\nUntil recent times, at least in the Western tradition, it was simply taken for granted that knowledge was something possessed only by humans \u2013 and probably ''adult'' humans at that. Sometimes the notion might stretch to ''Society-as-such'', as in (e.&nbsp;g.) \"the knowledge possessed by the Coptic culture\" (as opposed to its individual members), but that was not assured either. Nor was it usual to consider ''unconscious'' knowledge in any systematic way until this approach was popularized by [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]].<ref>There is quite a good case for this exclusive specialization used by philosophers, in that it allows for in-depth study of logic-procedures and other abstractions which are not found elsewhere. However this may lead to problems whenever the topic spills over into those excluded domains \u2013 e.&nbsp;g. when Kant (following Newton) dismissed ''Space and Time'' as axiomatically \"transcendental\" and \"a priori\" \u2013 a claim later disproved by [[Jean Piaget|Piaget's]] clinical studies. It also seems likely that the vexed problem of \"''[[infinite regress]]''\" can be largely (but not completely) solved by proper attention to how unconscious concepts are ''actually'' developed, both during infantile learning ''and'' as inherited \"pseudo-transcendentals\" inherited from the trial-and-error of previous generations. See also \"[[Tacit knowledge]]\".\n* [[Jean Piaget|Piaget, J.]], and B.Inhelder (1927/1969). ''The child's conception of time''. Routledge & Kegan Paul: London.\n* Piaget, J., and B. Inhelder (1948/1956). ''The child's conception of space''. Routledge & Kegan Paul: London.</ref>\n\nOther biological domains where \"knowledge\" might be said to reside, include: (iii) the ''immune system'', and (iv) in the ''DNA of the genetic code''. See the list of four \"epistemological domains\": [[Karl Popper|Popper]], (1975);<ref>[[Karl Popper|Popper, K.R.]] (1975). \"The rationality of scientific revolutions\"; in Rom Harr\u00e9 (ed.), ''Problems of Scientific Revolution: Scientific Progress and Obstacles to Progress in the Sciences''.

For biologists, knowledge must be usefully ''available'' to the system, though that system need not be conscious. Thus the criteria seem to be:\n* The system should apparently be dynamic and self-organizing (unlike a mere book ''on its own'').\n* The knowledge must constitute some sort of representation of \"the outside world\",<ref>This \"outside world\" could include other subsystems within the same organism \u2013 e.&nbsp;g. different \"mental levels\" corresponding to different Piagetian stages. See [[Theory of cognitive development]].</ref> or ways of dealing with it (directly or indirectly).\n* Some way must exist for the system to access this information quickly enough for it to be useful.\n\nScientific knowledge may not involve a claim to [[certainty]], maintaining [[skepticism]] means that a scientist will never be absolutely certain when they are correct and when they are not. It is thus an irony of proper [[scientific method]] that one must doubt even when correct, in the hopes that this practice will lead to greater convergence on the [[truth]] in general.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://philosophybites.com/2007/12/barry-stroud-on.html|title=philosophy bites|work=philosophybites.com}}</ref>\n\n== Religious meaning of knowledge ==\nIn many expressions of [[Christianity]], such as [[Catholicism]] and [[Anglicanism]], knowledge is one of the [[seven gifts of the Holy Spirit]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s1c1a7.htm#1831\n|title=Part Three, No. 1831\n|work=Catechism of the Catholic Church\n|accessdate=2007-04-20\n|url-status=dead\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504201314/http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s1c1a7.htm#1804#1831\n|archivedate=2007-05-04\n|df=\n}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Old Testament]]'s [[tree of the knowledge of good and evil]] contained the knowledge that separated Man from God: \"And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil...\" ({{bibleverse||Genesis|3:22|KJV}})\n\nIn [[Gnosticism]], divine knowledge or [[gnosis]] is hoped to be attained.\n\n\u0935\u093f\u0926\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0926\u093e\u0928 (Vidya Daan) i.e. [[knowledge sharing]] is a major part of [[D\u0101na|Daan]], a [[Niyama|tenet]] of all [[Indian religions|Dharmic Religions]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vhp.org/news/news-regional/delhi-seva|title=\u0935\u093f\u0926\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0926\u093e\u0928 \u0939\u0940 \u0938\u092c\u0938\u0947 \u092c\u0921\u093e \u0926\u093e\u0928 : \u0935\u093f\u0939\u093f\u092a \u2013 Vishva Hindu Parishad \u2013 Official Website|work=vhp.org|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820205238/http://vhp.org/news/news-regional/delhi-seva|archivedate=2011-08-20|df=}}</ref>\n[[Hindu]] Scriptures present two kinds of knowledge, ''Paroksh Gyan'' and ''Prataksh Gyan''.

Danish goalkeeper Michael Stensgaard as understudy to David James, following Bruce Grobbelaar's departure to Southampton. Defender Julian Dicks had returned to West Ham United after an unsuccessful season at Anfield, followed by midfielder Don Hutchison just after the start of the season, around the same time that veteran Ronnie Whelan called time on 15 years at Anfield and signed for Southend United.\n\nThe league campaign began in style with a 6-1 away win over newly promoted [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] in which Ian Rush and Steve McManaman both scored twice, with Robbie Fowler and Jan Molby scoring the other goals. [[Robbie Fowler]] then managed a hat-trick in less than five minutes in the next game, when Liverpool beat [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] 3-0 at Anfield. Fowler was on target again, along with John Barnes, in the next game - a 2-0 win at [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]].\n\n===September===\nThe month began with Roy Evans breaking the national defender transfer fee with a \u00a33.6 million move for Wimbledon's John Scales, followed 24 hours later by a \u00a33.5 million signing of Coventry's Phil Babb.\n\nLiverpool saw league action just three times in September, and failed to record any wins. The first game was a goalless draw at home to West Ham, followed by a 2-0 defeat at Manchester United before Ian Rush scored Liverpool's only league goal of the month in a 1-1 away draw with [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]. The Reds were sixth in the league, which was being led by Newcastle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpool-mad.co.uk/footydb/loadgen.asp?Day=24&Month=Sep&ssnno=124&teamno=342 |title=Snapshot Tables 1994-1995 24 Sep Liverpool - Liverpool FC - LFC Online |publisher=Liverpool-mad.co.uk |date=24 September 1994 |accessdate=6 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe League Cup quest began on 21 September, in which John Scales scored his first goal for the club and was joined on the scoresheet by Robbie Fowler in a 2-0 second-round first-leg win over [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] at [[Turf Moor]].<ref name=\"liverweb1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.liverweb.org.uk/season.asp?season=199495 |title=Liverpool Results 1994-95 |publisher=Liverweb |date= |accessdate=6 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n===October===\nOctober saw mixed results for Liverpool, who were beaten 3-2 by [[Kenny Dalglish]]'s title chasers [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] at [[Ewood Park]] before recording a 3-0 home win over Wimbledon and a 3-1 away win over [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]]. The month ended on a sour note with a 2-1 defeat at [[Queen's Park Rangers F.C.|QPR]].\n\nLiverpool eliminated Burnley from the League Cup with a 4-1 win in the second leg, in which Jamie Redknapp was on the scoresheet twice and [[Nigel Clough]] scored what would be his only goal of the season. In the next round, Ian Rush scored twice as the Reds defeated [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] 2-1 at Anfield.<ref name=\"liverweb1\"/>\n\nThe Reds ended October in fifth place, with Newcastle still leading the way, newly promoted [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] second and pushing hard for a rare title one season after promotion, followed by Manchester United and Blackburn.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpool-mad.co.uk/footydb/loadgen.asp?Day=31&Month=Oct&ssnno=124&teamno=342 |title=Snapshot Tables 1994-1995 31 Oct Liverpool - Liverpool FC - LFC Online |publisher=Liverpool-mad.co.uk |date=31 October 1994 |accessdate=6 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n===November===\nA goal from [[Robbie Fowler]] on 5 November gave Liverpool a 1-0 home win over fellow title challengers Nottingham Forest at Anfield. Fowler then scored twice in the next game, a 3-1 win home win over Chelsea. Liverpool were then on the losing side in the [[Merseyside derby]] at [[Goodison Park]], where a struggling [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] won 2-0. The month ended with a 1-1 home draw against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]].

Then came a 1-0 defeat at home to struggling Ipswich, followed by a goalless draw in the second Merseyside derby of the season at Anfield.\n\nThere was success in the cup competitions as an Ian Rush goal gave the Reds 1-0 win over Arsenal in the League Cup quarter-final. However, it took a penalty shoot-out in a replay to see off Division Two underdogs [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] in the FA Cup third round, while Division One strugglers Burnley faced Liverpool again after the League Cup meeting to hold the Reds to a goalless draw at Turf Moor, forcing yet another replay against lower league opposition.<ref name=\"liverweb1\"/>\n\n===February===\nAnother quiet month for league action saw the Reds held to 1-1 draws with Forest and QPR before scraping to a 2-1 win away to Sheffield Wednesday. As had happened last month, the biggest news for Liverpool was in the cup competitions. The FA Cup fourth round replay saw them overcome Burnley 1-0, before a fifth round clash with Wimbledon ended in a 1-1 draw and forced another replay, which the Reds won 2-0. Then came the League Cup semi-final first leg at Anfield, in which a Robbie Fowler goal saw the Reds defeat [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] (battling relegation but chasing glory in both cup competitions) 1-0.<ref name=\"liverweb1\"/>\n\nIt was looking too late for Liverpool to challenge for a league title win and a unique domestic treble, as they were now 15 points behind leaders Blackburn (though they did have two games in hnd) and occupying fourth place.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpool-mad.co.uk/footydb/loadgen.asp?Day=25&Month=Feb&ssnno=124&teamno=342 |title=Snapshot Tables 1994-1995 25 Feb Liverpool - Liverpool FC - LFC Online |publisher=Liverpool-mad.co.uk |date=25 February 1995 |accessdate=6 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n===March===\nMarch brought the familiar pattern for Liverpool of mixed results in the league but good form in the cups. Wins over title hopefuls Manchester United and Newcastle but a home defeat by relegation-threatened Coventry and an away draw with Tottenham Hotspur saw them fall to fifth place in the table and leave their title hopes almost completely dead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpool-mad.co.uk/footydb/loadgen.asp?Day=22&Month=Mar&ssnno=124&teamno=342 |title=Snapshot Tables 1994-1995 22 Mar Liverpool - Liverpool FC - LFC Online |publisher=Liverpool-mad.co.uk |date=22 March 1995 |accessdate=6 October 2012}}</ref> The FA Cup fifth round replay against Wimbledon saw Liverpool win 2-0, but their hopes of glory ended in the quarter-finals when they 2-1 at home to Tottenham Hotspur. However, the League Cup campaign continued with another 1-0 win over Crystal Palace and another goal from Robbie Fowler in the second leg of the semi-final, to book the Reds a [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley]] date with [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] and a chance of becoming the first team to win the League Cup five times.<ref name=\"liverweb1\"/>\n\n===April===\nThe League Cup final at [[Wembley Stadium]] on 2 April 1995 saw Liverpool beat Bolton 2-1 with a brace from Steve McManaman giving Roy Evans the first major trophy of his managerial career, and Liverpool's first major trophy since the FA Cup in 1992. With a place in the [[UEFA Cup]] guaranteed for next season and the title now beyond reasonable hope for Liverpool, there was less pressure on them in the final few games of the season, and they looked well placed to finish higher in the league than they had in any of the previous three seasons. Four wins and two defeats from six games made the previously crucial top-five finish a near certainty anyway.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpool-mad.co.uk/footydb/loadgen.asp?Day=29&Month=Apr&ssnno=124&teamno=342 |title=Snapshot Tables 1994-1995 29 Apr Liverpool - Liverpool FC - LFC Online |publisher=Liverpool-mad.co.uk |date=29 April 1995 |accessdate=6 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n===May===\nA draw with Wimbledon and defeats to two sides climbing clear of relegation danger (Aston Villa and West Ham United) were of little importance to a Liverpool side who could no longer win the title but had already booked European action with their League Cup glory. There was, however, one more game left to play. The final game of the league season was at Anfield on 14 May, and the opponents were Blackburn. Kenny Dalglish's new team were two points ahead of Manchester United - the last side capable of catching them - and a win for them would secure their first league title since 1914. However, if they lost or drew and Manchester United won at West Ham, the title would remain at [[Old Trafford]] for the third successive season. There was speculation that Liverpool would give their old manager an easy ride and let him add to the three title success he had managed them to in his time there, but Roy Evans dismissed such talk and his Liverpool side defeated Dalglish's men 2-1. The stadium was a scene of jubilation after the final whistle when news came through that the game in east London had ended in a 1-1 draw and Blackburn had ended their 81-year title wait.<ref name=\"liverweb1\"/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=notes|colwidth=30em}}\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n*{{cite web|author=Season Archive |url=http://www.lfchistory.net/SeasonArchive/Games/36 |title=Games for the 1994-1995 season |publisher=LFChistory.net |date= |accessdate=6 October 2012}}\n{{Liverpool F.C. seasons}}\n{{1994\u201395 in English football}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:1994-95 Liverpool F.C. season}}\n[[Category:Liverpool F.C. seasons]]\n[[Category:1994\u201395 FA Premier League by team|Liverpool]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use British English|date=February 2015}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2013}}\n{{Infobox football club season\n| club               = [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]\n| season             = 1994\u201395\n| manager            = {{Flagicon|ENG}} [[Roy Evans]]\n| chairman           = {{Flagicon|ENG}} [[David Moores]]\n| stadium            = [[Anfield]]\n| league             = [[Premier League|FA Premier League]]\n| league result      = [[1994\u201395 FA Premier League|4th]]\n| cup1               = [[FA Cup]]\n| cup1 result        = [[1994\u201395 FA Cup|Sixth round]]\n| cup2               = [[Football League Cup|League Cup]]\n| cup2 result        = '''[[1994\u201395 Football League Cup|Winners]]'''\n| league topscorer   = <br>[[Robbie Fowler]] (25)\n| season topscorer   = <br>[[Robbie Fowler]] (31)\n| average attendance = 34,743\n| prevseason         = [[1993\u201394 Liverpool F.C. season|1993\u201394]]\n| nextseason         = [[1995\u201396 Liverpool F.C. season|1995\u201396]]\n| pattern_la1        = _FCK_9495h\n| pattern_b1         = _FCK_9495h\n| pattern_ra1        = _FCK_9495h\n| pattern_sh1        = _FCK_9495h\n| pattern_so1        = _adidas_thick_stripes_white\n| leftarm1           = ff0000\n| body1              = ff0000\n| rightarm1          = ff0000\n| shorts1            = ff0000\n| socks1             = ff0000\n| pattern_la2        = _liverpool9395a\n| pattern_ra2        = _liverpool9395a\n| pattern_b2         = _liverpool9395a\n| pattern_so2        = _blacktop\n| leftarm2           = 00633a\n| body2              =\n| rightarm2          = 00633a\n| shorts2            = 000000\n| socks2             = 00633a\n| pattern_la3        = _blackcuffpiping\n| pattern_ra3        = _blackcuffpiping\n| pattern_b3         = _blackcollar\n| pattern_so3        = _color_3_stripes_yellow\n| leftarm3           = ffcc00\n| body3              = ffcc00\n| rightarm3          = ffcc00\n| shorts3            = 000000\n| socks3             = 000000\n}}\nThe '''1994-95 season''' was Liverpool's first full season under the management of Roy Evans, who had succeeded Graeme Souness halfway through 1993-94.\n\nThe season saw Liverpool win the League Cup for a record fifth time, beating Bolton Wanderers 2-1 in the final at [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley]] with two goals from Steve McManaman. They improved on last season's eighth-place finish to reach fourth place in the final table, their best final position in four years, although they never really looked like serious title contenders.\n\nEarly in the season, Evans bolstered his defence by signing John Scales from Wimbledon and Phil Babb from Coventry City. In attack, Robbie Fowler was top scorer with 25 goals in the league and 31 in all competitions, while the ageing Ian Rush continued to thrive with 12 in the league and 19 in all competitions.\n\nHeading out of the Anfield exit door early in the season was midfielder Don Hutchison to West Ham United, while January saw exit of defender Steve Nicol to Notts County after 13 years at Anfield. The club suffered a tragedy on 2 January 1995 when 19-year-old midfielder [[Ian Frodsham]], who was on a professional contract but had yet to play a first team game, died of [[cancer]] of the spine.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Danish goalkeeper Michael Stensgaard as understudy to David James, following Bruce Grobbelaar's departure to Southampton. Defender Julian Dicks had returned to West Ham United after an unsuccessful season at Anfield, followed by midfielder Don Hutchison just after the start of the season, around the same time that veteran Ronnie Whelan called time on 15 years at Anfield and signed for Southend United.\n\nThe league campaign began in style with a 6-1 away win over newly promoted [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] in which Ian Rush and Steve McManaman both scored twice, with Robbie Fowler and Jan Molby scoring the other goals. [[Robbie Fowler]] then managed a hat-trick in less than five minutes in the next game, when Liverpool beat [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] 3-0 at Anfield. Fowler was on target again, along with John Barnes, in the next game - a 2-0 win at [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]].\n\n===September===\nThe month began with Roy Evans breaking the national defender transfer fee with a \u00a33.6 million move for Wimbledon's John Scales, followed 24 hours later by a \u00a33.5 million signing of Coventry's Phil Babb.\n\nLiverpool saw league action just three times in September, and failed to record any wins. The first game was a goalless draw at home to West Ham, followed by a 2-0 defeat at Manchester United before Ian Rush scored Liverpool's only league goal of the month in a 1-1 away draw with [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]. The Reds were sixth in the league, which was being led by Newcastle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpool-mad.co.uk/footydb/loadgen.asp?Day=24&Month=Sep&ssnno=124&teamno=342 |title=Snapshot Tables 1994-1995 24 Sep Liverpool - Liverpool FC - LFC Online |publisher=Liverpool-mad.co.uk |date=24 September 1994 |accessdate=6 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe League Cup quest began on 21 September, in which John Scales scored his first goal for the club and was joined on the scoresheet by Robbie Fowler in a 2-0 second-round first-leg win over [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] at [[Turf Moor]].<ref name=\"liverweb1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.liverweb.org.uk/season.asp?season=199495 |title=Liverpool Results 1994-95 |publisher=Liverweb |date= |accessdate=6 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n===October===\nOctober saw mixed results for Liverpool, who were beaten 3-2 by [[Kenny Dalglish]]'s title chasers [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] at [[Ewood Park]] before recording a 3-0 home win over Wimbledon and a 3-1 away win over [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]]. The month ended on a sour note with a 2-1 defeat at [[Queen's Park Rangers F.C.|QPR]].\n\nLiverpool eliminated Burnley from the League Cup with a 4-1 win in the second leg, in which Jamie Redknapp was on the scoresheet twice and [[Nigel Clough]] scored what would be his only goal of the season. In the next round, Ian Rush scored twice as the Reds defeated [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] 2-1 at Anfield.<ref name=\"liverweb1\"/>\n\nThe Reds ended October in fifth place, with Newcastle still leading the way, newly promoted [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] second and pushing hard for a rare title one season after promotion, followed by Manchester United and Blackburn.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpool-mad.co.uk/footydb/loadgen.asp?Day=31&Month=Oct&ssnno=124&teamno=342 |title=Snapshot Tables 1994-1995 31 Oct Liverpool - Liverpool FC - LFC Online |publisher=Liverpool-mad.co.uk |date=31 October 1994 |accessdate=6 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n===November===\nA goal from [[Robbie Fowler]] on 5 November gave Liverpool a 1-0 home win over fellow title challengers Nottingham Forest at Anfield. Fowler then scored twice in the next game, a 3-1 win home win over Chelsea. Liverpool were then on the losing side in the [[Merseyside derby]] at [[Goodison Park]], where a struggling [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] won 2-0. The month ended with a 1-1 home draw against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]. The League Cup quest continued at the end of the month when an Ian Rush hat-trick disposed of Blackburn in the fourth round at [[Ewood Park]].<ref name=\"liverweb1\"/> The Reds ended the month fourth in the Premier League, six points behind leaders Blackburn.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpool-mad.co.uk/footydb/loadgen.asp?Day=26&Month=Nov&ssnno=124&teamno=342 |title=Snapshot Tables 1994-1995 26 Nov Liverpool - Liverpool FC - LFC Online |publisher=Liverpool-mad.co.uk |date=26 November 1994 |accessdate=6 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n===December===\nLiverpool were unbeaten in the six league games they played in December, but the first three of those were draws so the subsequent wins over [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] restricted them to third place in the league when wins from those first three games would have put them just one point behind leaders Blackburn.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpool-mad.co.uk/footydb/loadgen.asp?Day=31&Month=Dec&ssnno=124&teamno=342 |title=Snapshot Tables 1994-1995 31 Dec Liverpool - Liverpool FC - LFC Online |publisher=Liverpool-mad.co.uk |date=31 December 1994 |accessdate=6 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n===January===\nThe first month of 1995 saw the departure of Liverpool's longest serving player [[Steve Nicol]], who signed for Division One strugglers [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] after losing his place in the first team to new arrivals John Scales and Phil Babb.\n\nHowever, the year began on a bright note with a 4-0 home win over [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]]. Then came a 1-0 defeat at home to struggling Ipswich, followed by a goalless draw in the second Merseyside derby of the season at Anfield.\n\nThere was success in the cup competitions as an Ian Rush goal gave the Reds 1-0 win over Arsenal in the League Cup quarter-final. However, it took a penalty shoot-out in a replay to see off Division Two underdogs [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] in the FA Cup third round, while Division One strugglers Burnley faced Liverpool again after the League Cup meeting to hold the Reds to a goalless draw at Turf Moor, forcing yet another replay against lower league opposition.<ref name=\"liverweb1\"/>\n\n===February===\nAnother quiet month for league action saw the Reds held to 1-1 draws with Forest and QPR before scraping to a 2-1 win away to Sheffield Wednesday. As had happened last month, the biggest news for Liverpool was in the cup competitions. The FA Cup fourth round replay saw them overcome Burnley 1-0, before a fifth round clash with Wimbledon ended in a 1-1 draw and forced another replay, which the Reds won 2-0. Then came the League Cup semi-final first leg at Anfield, in which a Robbie Fowler goal saw the Reds defeat [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] (battling relegation but chasing glory in both cup competitions) 1-0.<ref name=\"liverweb1\"/>\n\nIt was looking too late for Liverpool to challenge for a league title win and a unique domestic treble, as they were now 15 points behind leaders Blackburn (though they did have two games in hnd) and occupying fourth place.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpool-mad.co.uk/footydb/loadgen.asp?Day=25&Month=Feb&ssnno=124&teamno=342 |title=Snapshot Tables 1994-1995 25 Feb Liverpool - Liverpool FC - LFC Online |publisher=Liverpool-mad.co.uk |date=25 February 1995 |accessdate=6 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n===March===\nMarch brought the familiar pattern for Liverpool of mixed results in the league but good form in the cups. Wins over title hopefuls Manchester United and Newcastle but a home defeat by relegation-threatened Coventry and an away draw with Tottenham Hotspur saw them fall to fifth place in the table and leave their title hopes almost completely dead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpool-mad.co.uk/footydb/loadgen.asp?Day=22&Month=Mar&ssnno=124&teamno=342 |title=Snapshot Tables 1994-1995 22 Mar Liverpool - Liverpool FC - LFC Online |publisher=Liverpool-mad.co.uk |date=22 March 1995 |accessdate=6 October 2012}}</ref> The FA Cup fifth round replay against Wimbledon saw Liverpool win 2-0, but their hopes of glory ended in the quarter-finals when they 2-1 at home to Tottenham Hotspur. However, the League Cup campaign continued with another 1-0 win over Crystal Palace and another goal from Robbie Fowler in the second leg of the semi-final, to book the Reds a [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley]] date with [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] and a chance of becoming the first team to win the League Cup five times.<ref name=\"liverweb1\"/>\n\n===April===\nThe League Cup final at [[Wembley Stadium]] on 2 April 1995 saw Liverpool beat Bolton 2-1 with a brace from Steve McManaman giving Roy Evans the first major trophy of his managerial career, and Liverpool's first major trophy since the FA Cup in 1992. With a place in the [[UEFA Cup]] guaranteed for next season and the title now beyond reasonable hope for Liverpool, there was less pressure on them in the final few games of the season, and they looked well placed to finish higher in the league than they had in any of the previous three seasons. Four wins and two defeats from six games made the previously crucial top-five finish a near certainty anyway.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpool-mad.co.uk/footydb/loadgen.asp?Day=29&Month=Apr&ssnno=124&teamno=342 |title=Snapshot Tables 1994-1995 29 Apr Liverpool - Liverpool FC - LFC Online |publisher=Liverpool-mad.co.uk |date=29 April 1995 |accessdate=6 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n===May===\nA draw with Wimbledon and defeats to two sides climbing clear of relegation danger (Aston Villa and West Ham United) were of little importance to a Liverpool side who could no longer win the title but had already booked European action with their League Cup glory. There was, however, one more game left to play. The final game of the league season was at Anfield on 14 May, and the opponents were Blackburn. Kenny Dalglish's new team were two points ahead of Manchester United - the last side capable of catching them - and a win for them would secure their first league title since 1914. However, if they lost or drew and Manchester United won at West Ham, the title would remain at [[Old Trafford]] for the third successive season. There was speculation that Liverpool would give their old manager an easy ride and let him add to the three title success he had managed them to in his time there, but Roy Evans dismissed such talk and his Liverpool side defeated Dalglish's men 2-1. The stadium was a scene of jubilation after the final whistle when news came through that the game in east London had ended in a 1-1 draw and Blackburn had ended their 81-year title wait.<ref name=\"liverweb1\"/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=notes|colwidth=30em}}\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n*{{cite web|author=Season Archive |url=http://www.lfchistory.net/SeasonArchive/Games/36 |title=Games for the 1994-1995 season |publisher=LFChistory.net |date= |accessdate=6 October 2012}}\n{{Liverpool F.C. seasons}}\n{{1994\u201395 in English football}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:1994-95 Liverpool F.C. season}}\n[[Category:Liverpool F.C. seasons]]\n[[Category:1994\u201395 FA Premier League by team|Liverpool]]\n", "name_user": "Tassedethe", "label": "safe", "comment": "v2.02 - Repaired 1 link to disambiguation page -(You can help)-Andy Clarke", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994%E2%80%9395_Liverpool_F.C._season"}

The last outbreak occurred in 1551, after which the disease apparently vanished. The onset of symptoms was sudden, with death often occurring within hours. Its cause remains unknown, although it has been suggested that an unknown species of [[hantavirus pulmonary syndrome|hantavirus]] was responsible.\n\n== Signs and symptoms ==\n[[John Caius]] was a practising physician in Shrewsbury in 1551, when an outbreak occurred, and he described the symptoms and signs of the disease in ''A Boke or Counseill Against the Disease Commonly Called the Sweate, or Sweatyng Sicknesse'' (1552), which is the main historical source of knowledge of the disease. It began very suddenly with a sense of apprehension, followed by cold shivers (sometimes very violent), giddiness, headache, and severe pains in the neck, shoulders, and limbs, with great exhaustion. The cold stage might last from half an hour to three hours, after which the hot and sweating stage began. The characteristic sweat broke out suddenly without any obvious cause. A sense of heat, headache, [[delirium]], rapid pulse, and intense thirst accompanied the sweat. Palpitation and pain in the heart were frequent symptoms, as well. No skin eruptions were noted by observers, including Caius.  In the final stages, there was either general exhaustion and collapse, or an irresistible urge to sleep, which Caius thought was fatal if the patient were permitted to give way to it. One attack did not produce immunity, and some people suffered several bouts before dying.<ref name=Heyman2014>{{cite journal|authors=Heyman P. & Simons L. & Cochez, C. |title=Were the English Sweating Sickness and the Picardy Sweat Caused by Hantaviruses?|journal= Viruses|date= 2014|volume=6|number=1|pages=151\u2013171|doi=10.3390/v6010151|pmid=24402305 |pmc=3917436}}</ref> The disease tended to occur in summer and early autumn.\n\n== Cause ==\nThe cause is the most mysterious aspect of the disease. Commentators then and now put much blame on the sewage, generally poor sanitation, and contaminated water supplies of the time, which might have harboured the source of infection.

The last outbreak occurred in 1551, after which the disease apparently vanished. The onset of symptoms was sudden, with death often occurring within hours. Its cause remains unknown, although it has been suggested that an unknown species of [[hantavirus pulmonary syndrome|hantavirus]] was responsible.\n\n== Signs and symptoms ==\n[[John Caius]] was a practising physician in Shrewsbury in 1551, when an outbreak occurred, and he described the symptoms and signs of the disease in ''A Boke or Counseill Against the Disease Commonly Called the Sweate, or Sweatyng Sicknesse'' (1552), which is the main historical source of knowledge of the disease. It began very suddenly with a sense of apprehension, followed by cold shivers (sometimes very violent), giddiness, headache, and severe pains in the neck, shoulders, and limbs, with great exhaustion. The cold stage might last from half an hour to three hours, after which the hot and sweating stage began. The characteristic sweat broke out suddenly without any obvious cause. A sense of heat, headache, [[delirium]], rapid pulse, and intense thirst accompanied the sweat. Palpitation and pain in the heart were frequent symptoms, as well. No skin eruptions were noted by observers, including Caius.  In the final stages, there was either general exhaustion and collapse, or an irresistible urge to sleep, which Caius thought was fatal if the patient were permitted to give way to it.

These Glycoazodyes use a [[Ester|diester]] linker, specifically a [[Succinic acid|succinyl]] bridge. An [[ester]] group bonds the sugar to an n-[[alkane]] spacer, and the spacer bonds to the dye through another [[ester]] group.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Synthesis ====\nFirst-generation Glycoazodyes are synthesized using [[glucose]], [[galactose]] or [[lactose]] as the sugar group. The point of [[Ester|esterification]] is controlled by selectively protecting and deprotecting alcohol groups on the sugar, or by choosing azo dyes with different alcohol group positions.\u00a0 Either the dye or the sugar group can be [[Succinylation|succinylated]] by reacting a free alcohol group with [[succinic anhydride]]. The resulting hemisuccinate then reacts with a free alcohol group on either the dye or the sugar. The condensation product is then deprotected.<ref name=\":0\" /> \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n=== Second-generation ===\nThe second-generation of Glycoazodyes was first reported in 2008. These Glycoazodyes use an etherel linker. An ether group bonds the sugar and the dye to an n-[[alkane]] spacer, and the spacer bonds to the dye through another ether group.

These Glycoazodyes use a [[Ester|diester]] linker, specifically a [[Succinic acid|succinyl]] bridge. An [[ester]] group bonds the sugar to an n-[[alkane]] spacer, and the spacer bonds to the dye through another [[ester]] group.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Synthesis ====\nFirst-generation Glycoazodyes are synthesized using [[glucose]], [[galactose]] or [[lactose]] as the sugar group. The point of [[Ester|esterification]] is controlled by selectively protecting and deprotecting alcohol groups on the sugar, or by choosing azo dyes with different alcohol group positions.\u00a0 Either the dye or the sugar group can be [[Succinylation|succinylated]] by reacting a free alcohol group with [[succinic anhydride]]. The resulting hemisuccinate then reacts with a free alcohol group on either the dye or the sugar. The condensation product is then deprotected.<ref name=\":0\" /> \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n=== Second-generation ===\nThe second-generation of Glycoazodyes was first reported in 2008. These Glycoazodyes use an etherel linker. An ether group bonds the sugar and the dye to an n-[[alkane]] spacer, and the spacer bonds to the dye through another ether group. Like first-generation Glycoazodyes, second-generation Glycoazodyes use glucose, galactose or lactose as the sugar group.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\n=== Third-generation ===\nThe third-generation of Glycoazodyes was first reported in 2015.

The city terminus was at the junction of [[Chambers Street (Manhattan)|Chambers]] and [[Hudson Street (Manhattan)|Hudson Streets]]; the track was laid along Hudson, [[Canal Street (Manhattan)|Canal]], and West Streets, to [[Tenth Avenue (Manhattan)|Tenth Avenue]], which it followed to the upper city station at [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th Street]]. Over this part of the right-of-way, the rails were laid at grade along the streets, and since by the corporation regulations locomotives were not allowed, the cars were drawn by a [[dummy engine]], which, according to an 1851 description, consumed its own smoke. While passing through the city the train of cars was preceded by a man on horseback known as a \"West Side cowboy\" or \"Tenth Avenue cowboy\" who gave notice of its approach by blowing a horn.<ref>{{cite book |title=Hudson River and the Hudson River Rail-Road |url=http://www.catskillarchive.com/rrextra/abnyh.Html |accessdate=September 18, 2015 |year=1851 |publisher=Bradbury & Guild |location=Boston |page=12}}</ref><ref>[http://blog.thehighline.org/2008/03/12/photo-of-the-week-west-side-cowboy-twofer/ Highline Photo of the Week] West Side Cowboy</ref>\n\nAt 34th Street the right-of-way curved into [[11th Avenue (Manhattan)|Eleventh Avenue]], the dummy engine was detached, and the regular locomotive took the train. As far as [[60th Street (Manhattan)|60th Street]], the track was at street level. The first cut was at Fort Washington Point. The railroad crossed [[Spuyten Duyvil Creek]] on a drawbridge; a fatal wreck occurred there January 13, 1882 when the Atlantic Express, stopped on the line, was rear-ended by a local train, telescoping the last two palace cars, where the stoves and lamps were upset and ignited the woodwork and upholstery.<ref>{{cite news |title=Fatal Disaster on the Hudson River Railroad |url=http://www.catskillarchive.com/rrextra/wksdfl.Html |newspaper=[[Frank Leslie's Weekly]] |date=January 21, 1882 |accessdate=April 10, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 1867 the [[New York Central Railroad]] and Hudson River Railroad were united by [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]], being merged in 1869 to form the [[New York Central and Hudson River Railroad]]. The railroad acquired the former Episcopal church's [[St. John's Park]] property and built a large freight depot at Beach and Varick streets which opened in 1868. The tracks south to Chambers Street were then removed.<ref>Joint Report of the New York, New Jersey Port and Harbor development Commission, 1917</ref> In 1871, the [[Spuyten Duyvil and Port Morris Railroad]] ([[Hudson Line (Metro-North)|Hudson Line]]) opened, and most passenger trains were rerouted into the new [[Grand Central Depot]] via that line along the northeast bank of the [[Harlem River]] and the [[New York and Harlem Railroad]] ([[Harlem Line]]), also part of the New York Central system. The old line south of [[Spuyten Duyvil, Bronx|Spuyten Duyvil]] remained for freight to the docks along Manhattan's west side and minimal passenger service to the [[West Side station]] on [[Chambers Street (Manhattan)|Chambers Street]] (used until 1916).\n\n== Grade separation ==\n[[File:Rail entry W82 St snowy jeh.JPG|thumb|left|View from under Henry Hudson Parkway toward maintenance gate to tracks]]\nAs the city grew, congestion worsened on the west side. Eventually plans were drawn up for a grade-separated line. The [[West Side Elevated Highway]] was built with the line's grade separation in the 1930s. Work on the highway&nbsp;\u2013 named for Manhattan Borough President [[Julius Miller]], who championed it&nbsp;\u2013 began in 1925, and the first section was dedicated June 28, 1934. This included a new elevated eight-track freight terminal at [[St. John's Park]], located several blocks north of the old one, with a south edge at [[Spring Street (Manhattan)|Spring Street]]. North of there, an elevated structure (the present-day [[High Line]]) carried two tracks north on the west side of [[Washington Street (Manhattan)|Washington Street]], curving onto the east side of [[Tenth Avenue (Manhattan)|Tenth Avenue]] at [[14th Street (Manhattan)|14th Street]], then crossing Tenth Avenue at [[17th Street (Manhattan)|17th Street]] and heading north along its west side. Just south of the [[West Side Yard|Pennsylvania Station rail yard at 31st\u201333rd Streets]], the line turned west on the north side of [[30th Street (Manhattan)|30th Street]], then north just east of the [[West Side Highway]]. The northernmost bridge crossed [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th Street]], and a ramp took it back to [[Eleventh Avenue (Manhattan)|Eleventh Avenue]] south of [[35th Street (Manhattan)|35th Street]].

South of Penn Station, a {{convert|1.45|mi|km|adj=on}} elevated section of the line abandoned since 1980 has been transformed into an elevated park called the [[High Line]]. The south section of the park from [[Gansevoort Street]] to 20th Street opened in 2009 and the second section up to 30th Street opened in 2011, while the final section to 34th Street opened in 2014.\n\n==Hudson River Railroad==\n[[File:New York City Railroads ca 1900.png|thumb|left|New York City Railroads {{circa|1900}}]]\n[[File:(King1893NYC) pg820 NEW-YORK CENTRAL & HUDSON-RIVER FREIGHT DEPOT ON HUDSON STREET.jpg|thumb|left|Hudson River R.R.

The city terminus was at the junction of [[Chambers Street (Manhattan)|Chambers]] and [[Hudson Street (Manhattan)|Hudson Streets]]; the track was laid along Hudson, [[Canal Street (Manhattan)|Canal]], and West Streets, to [[Tenth Avenue (Manhattan)|Tenth Avenue]], which it followed to the upper city station at [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th Street]]. Over this part of the right-of-way, the rails were laid at grade along the streets, and since by the corporation regulations locomotives were not allowed, the cars were drawn by a [[dummy engine]], which, according to an 1851 description, consumed its own smoke. While passing through the city the train of cars was preceded by a man on horseback known as a \"West Side cowboy\" or \"Tenth Avenue cowboy\" who gave notice of its approach by blowing a horn.<ref>{{cite book |title=Hudson River and the Hudson River Rail-Road |url=http://www.catskillarchive.com/rrextra/abnyh.Html |accessdate=September 18, 2015 |year=1851 |publisher=Bradbury & Guild |location=Boston |page=12}}</ref><ref>[http://blog.thehighline.org/2008/03/12/photo-of-the-week-west-side-cowboy-twofer/ Highline Photo of the Week] West Side Cowboy</ref>\n\nAt 34th Street the right-of-way curved into [[11th Avenue (Manhattan)|Eleventh Avenue]], the dummy engine was detached, and the regular locomotive took the train. As far as [[60th Street (Manhattan)|60th Street]], the track was at street level. The first cut was at Fort Washington Point. The railroad crossed [[Spuyten Duyvil Creek]] on a drawbridge; a fatal wreck occurred there January 13, 1882 when the Atlantic Express, stopped on the line, was rear-ended by a local train, telescoping the last two palace cars, where the stoves and lamps were upset and ignited the woodwork and upholstery.<ref>{{cite news |title=Fatal Disaster on the Hudson River Railroad |url=http://www.catskillarchive.com/rrextra/wksdfl.Html |newspaper=[[Frank Leslie's Weekly]] |date=January 21, 1882 |accessdate=April 10, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 1867 the [[New York Central Railroad]] and Hudson River Railroad were united by [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]], being merged in 1869 to form the [[New York Central and Hudson River Railroad]]. The railroad acquired the former Episcopal church's [[St. John's Park]] property and built a large freight depot at Beach and Varick streets which opened in 1868. The tracks south to Chambers Street were then removed.<ref>Joint Report of the New York, New Jersey Port and Harbor development Commission, 1917</ref> In 1871, the [[Spuyten Duyvil and Port Morris Railroad]] ([[Hudson Line (Metro-North)|Hudson Line]]) opened, and most passenger trains were rerouted into the new [[Grand Central Depot]] via that line along the northeast bank of the [[Harlem River]] and the [[New York and Harlem Railroad]] ([[Harlem Line]]), also part of the New York Central system. The old line south of [[Spuyten Duyvil, Bronx|Spuyten Duyvil]] remained for freight to the docks along Manhattan's west side and minimal passenger service to the [[West Side station]] on [[Chambers Street (Manhattan)|Chambers Street]] (used until 1916).\n\n== Grade separation ==\n[[File:Rail entry W82 St snowy jeh.JPG|thumb|left|View from under Henry Hudson Parkway toward maintenance gate to tracks]]\nAs the city grew, congestion worsened on the west side. Eventually plans were drawn up for a grade-separated line. The [[West Side Elevated Highway]] was built with the line's grade separation in the 1930s. Work on the highway&nbsp;\u2013 named for Manhattan Borough President [[Julius Miller]], who championed it&nbsp;\u2013 began in 1925, and the first section was dedicated June 28, 1934. This included a new elevated eight-track freight terminal at [[St. John's Park]], located several blocks north of the old one, with a south edge at [[Spring Street (Manhattan)|Spring Street]]. North of there, an elevated structure (the present-day [[High Line]]) carried two tracks north on the west side of [[Washington Street (Manhattan)|Washington Street]], curving onto the east side of [[Tenth Avenue (Manhattan)|Tenth Avenue]] at [[14th Street (Manhattan)|14th Street]], then crossing Tenth Avenue at [[17th Street (Manhattan)|17th Street]] and heading north along its west side. Just south of the [[West Side Yard|Pennsylvania Station rail yard at 31st\u201333rd Streets]], the line turned west on the north side of [[30th Street (Manhattan)|30th Street]], then north just east of the [[West Side Highway]]. The northernmost bridge crossed [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th Street]], and a ramp took it back to [[Eleventh Avenue (Manhattan)|Eleventh Avenue]] south of [[35th Street (Manhattan)|35th Street]]. The elevated line was built through the second or third floors of several buildings along the route; others were served directly by elevated sidings.<ref name=\"nyt19340603\">L.H.

His project, called the ''West Side Improvement'', was twice as expensive as the [[Hoover Dam]] and created the [[Henry Hudson Parkway]], as well as a [[Freedom Tunnel|railroad tunnel]] through the park. The large [[Riverside South, Manhattan#60th Street Rail Yard|60th Street Yard]] served as the dividing point between the two-track realignment and a wider four-track line to the north. North of 123rd Street, the line became elevated between the Henry Hudson Parkway and [[Riverside Drive (Manhattan)|Riverside Drive]] before returning to the surface and crossing under the Parkway to its west side near [[159th Street (Manhattan)|159th Street]]. It continues along the shore of the [[Hudson River]] to the [[Spuyten Duyvil Bridge]], a [[swing bridge]] across the [[Harlem Ship Canal]] ([[Spuyten Duyvil Creek]]), before merging with the [[Hudson Line (Metro-North)|Hudson Line]] just north of the bridge.<ref name=\"railroad.net improvement\"/>\n\nIn addition to serving the industrial and dock areas of the [[Lower West Side, Manhattan|Lower West Side]], the line was the primary route for produce and meat into New York, serving warehouses in the [[West Village]], [[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea]], and the [[Meatpacking District, Manhattan|Meatpacking District]], as well as serving the [[James Farley Post Office]] and private freight services.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://railroad.net/articles/railfanning/westside/index.php|title=RAILROAD.NET - New York Central's 1934 West Side Improvement|work=railroad.net}}</ref>\n\n==Donald Trump and Riverside South==\n[[File:Riverside-south-overview.jpg|thumb|left|Looking north in Riverside Park South.
