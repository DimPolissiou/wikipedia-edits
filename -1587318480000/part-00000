It follows a Marine who was killed in action, only to be brought back to life with superpowers by an organization that wants to use him as a weapon.\n\nDevelopment of a Bloodshot film began in 2012, with [[Jared Leto]] originally in talks to star in July 2017. In March 2018, Diesel was hired to portray the title role, and the rest of the cast joined over the following months. Filming commenced in South Africa in August 2018, lasting through October.\n\n''Bloodshot'' was theatrically released in the United States on March 13, 2020, by [[Sony Pictures Releasing]]. The film received mixed reviews from critics and has grossed $29 million worldwide. Due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]] closing theaters across the globe, Sony made the film available digitally on-demand less than two weeks after it was released theatrically.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter leading a successful rescue operation in [[Mombasa]], U.S. Airman Ray Garrison and his wife Gina travel for a holiday at an Italian beachside town in the [[Amalfi Coast]]. However, they are kidnapped by a group of mercenaries led by Martin Axe, who demands to know the source of the Mombasa hostage operation. Since Ray is not privy to this information, Axe kills him and Gina.\n\nRay is later resurrected by Rising Spirit Tech, a company that specializes in developing cybernetic enhancements for disabled US military personnel. The company's CEO, Dr. Emil Harting, tells Ray that he is the first successful candidate that they have resurrected using a [[nanorobotics|special nanite technology]]. Ray is also introduced to Dr Harting's other patients including former [[United States Navy|US Navy]] diver \"KT\", whom he strikes a friendship with, and former soldiers Jimmy Dalton and Marcus Tibbs, with whom he gets on poorly.\n\nAfter experiencing \"flashbacks\" of Gina and Axe, Ray escapes Rising Spirit's laboratory in [[Kuala Lumpur]] and pursues Axe, seeking to avenge Gina's death. Using the nanites to hack into computer databases, Ray tracks down Axe to [[Budapest]]. After trapping his convoy in a tunnel, Ray kills Axe's bodyguards before executing the mercenary. He is later recovered by KT, Dalton and Tibbs, who bring him back to Rising Spirit for reprogramming. In truth, Harting created false memories of Gina's death as part of a plot to eliminate rivals in Rising Spirit.\n\nAfter his memories are wiped and reprogrammed, Ray is sent to kill Nick Baris in [[East Sussex]], \"remembering\" him to be Gina's killer. Though Ray manages to kill Baris and his bodyguards, Baris has forced computer programmer Wilfred Wigans to build an [[electromagnetic pulse|EMP bomb]], which is ignited after Baris' death, incapacitating Ray and severing communications with Rising Spirit. After \"resurrecting\" Ray, Wigans reveals that Rising Spirit planted false memories to turn him into a killing machine. Ray also discovers Gina is alive but had left him five years ago and started a family in [[Westminster]].\n\nGrowing disillusioned with Harting's exploitation of Ray, KT seeks Wigans' help in taking him down. Meanwhile, Ray is recaptured by Dalton and Tibbs following a pursuit. He is brought back to Rising Spirit's laboratory for reprogramming, but escapes with the help of KT and Wigans, who sabotage the reprogramming process and Rising Spirit's computers. Breaking free, Ray fights Dalton and Tibbs on top of an elevator. Dalton willingly lets Tibbs fall to his death before continuing the fight until Ray punches him down the elevator shaft, killing him. Ray confronts Harting, who manages to drain the nanites, but is killed when the second grenade he shoots at Ray is dismantled by the nanites and dropped directly at his feet. Ray is later rebuilt by Wigans and KT, and the three then leave in search of a new life.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Vin Diesel]] as [[Bloodshot (comics)|Ray Garrison / Bloodshot]]\n* [[Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez]] as KT\n* [[Sam Heughan]] as Jimmy Dalton\n* [[Toby Kebbell]] as Martin Axe\n* [[Guy Pearce]] as Dr. Emil Harting\n* [[Lamorne Morris]] as Wilfred Wigans\n* [[Talulah Riley]] as Gina Garrison\n* Alex Hernandez as Marcus Tibbs\n* [[J\u00f3hannes Haukur J\u00f3hannesson]] as Nick Baris\n* Tamer Burjaq as  Mombasa Gunman\n* Siddharth Dhananjay as Eric\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\nIn March 2012, it was announced that [[Columbia Pictures]] had acquired the film rights to the [[Valiant Comics]] character [[Bloodshot (comics)|Bloodshot]], which would be produced by [[Original Film]] and [[Valiant Entertainment]].

It follows a Marine who was killed in action, only to be brought back to life with superpowers by an organization that wants to use him as a weapon.\n\nDevelopment of a Bloodshot film began in 2012, with [[Jared Leto]] originally in talks to star in July 2017. In March 2018, Diesel was hired to portray the title role, and the rest of the cast joined over the following months. Filming commenced in South Africa in August 2018, lasting through October.\n\n''Bloodshot'' was theatrically released in the United States on March 13, 2020, by [[Sony Pictures Releasing]]. The film received mixed reviews from critics and has grossed $29 million worldwide. Due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]] closing theaters across the globe, Sony made the film available digitally on-demand less than two weeks after it was released theatrically.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter leading a successful rescue operation in [[Mombasa]], U.S. Airman Ray Garrison and his wife Gina travel for a holiday at an Italian beachside town in the [[Amalfi Coast]]. However, they are kidnapped by a group of mercenaries led by Martin Axe, who demands to know the source of the Mombasa hostage operation. Since Ray is not privy to this information, Axe kills him and Gina.\n\nRay is later resurrected by Rising Spirit Tech, a company that specializes in developing cybernetic enhancements for disabled US military personnel. The company's CEO, Dr. Emil Harting, tells Ray that he is the first successful candidate that they have resurrected using a [[nanorobotics|special nanite technology]]. Ray is also introduced to Dr Harting's other patients including former [[United States Navy|US Navy]] diver \"KT\", whom he strikes a friendship with, and former soldiers Jimmy Dalton and Marcus Tibbs, with whom he gets on poorly.\n\nAfter experiencing \"flashbacks\" of Gina and Axe, Ray escapes Rising Spirit's laboratory in [[Kuala Lumpur]] and pursues Axe, seeking to avenge Gina's death. Using the nanites to hack into computer databases, Ray tracks down Axe to [[Budapest]]. After trapping his convoy in a tunnel, Ray kills Axe's bodyguards before executing the mercenary. He is later recovered by KT, Dalton and Tibbs, who bring him back to Rising Spirit for reprogramming. In truth, Harting created false memories of Gina's death as part of a plot to eliminate rivals in Rising Spirit.\n\nAfter his memories are wiped and reprogrammed, Ray is sent to kill Nick Baris in [[East Sussex]], \"remembering\" him to be Gina's killer. Though Ray manages to kill Baris and his bodyguards, Baris has forced computer programmer Wilfred Wigans to build an [[electromagnetic pulse|EMP bomb]], which is ignited after Baris' death, incapacitating Ray and severing communications with Rising Spirit. After \"resurrecting\" Ray, Wigans reveals that Rising Spirit planted false memories to turn him into a killing machine. Ray also discovers Gina is alive but had left him five years ago and started a family in [[Westminster]].\n\nGrowing disillusioned with Harting's exploitation of Ray, KT seeks Wigans' help in taking him down. Meanwhile, Ray is recaptured by Dalton and Tibbs following a pursuit. He is brought back to Rising Spirit's laboratory for reprogramming, but escapes with the help of KT and Wigans, who sabotage the reprogramming process and Rising Spirit's computers. Breaking free, Ray fights Dalton and Tibbs on top of an elevator. Dalton willingly lets Tibbs fall to his death before continuing the fight until Ray punches him down the elevator shaft, killing him. Ray confronts Harting, who manages to drain the nanites, but is killed when the second grenade he shoots at Ray is dismantled by the nanites and dropped directly at his feet. Ray is later rebuilt by Wigans and KT, and the three then leave in search of a new life.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Vin Diesel]] as [[Bloodshot (comics)|Ray Garrison / Bloodshot]]\n* [[Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez]] as KT\n* [[Sam Heughan]] as Jimmy Dalton\n* [[Toby Kebbell]] as Martin Axe\n* [[Guy Pearce]] as Dr. Emil Harting\n* [[Lamorne Morris]] as Wilfred Wigans\n* [[Talulah Riley]] as Gina Garrison\n* Alex Hernandez as Marcus Tibbs\n* [[J\u00f3hannes Haukur J\u00f3hannesson]] as Nick Baris\n* Tamer Burjaq as  Mombasa Gunman\n* Siddharth Dhananjay as Eric\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\nIn March 2012, it was announced that [[Columbia Pictures]] had acquired the film rights to the [[Valiant Comics]] character [[Bloodshot (comics)|Bloodshot]], which would be produced by [[Original Film]] and [[Valiant Entertainment]].

On 22 November 1916, the [[Royal Spanish Football Federation|Spanish Football Federation]] proposed that the clubs from [[Cantabria]] move from the Northern Federation, where the Basque teams were integrated, to the Regional Cantabric one, with the Asturian clubs.\n\nWith the name of ''Cantabric team'', it played four official matches between 1917 and 1918 in the defunct [[:es:Copa del Pr\u00edncipe de Asturias de f\u00fatbol|Copa Pr\u00edncipe de Asturias]], organised by the Spanish Federation and played by all the Spanish Regional teams.<ref name=principe>{{cite web|url=http://www.cihefe.es/cuadernosdefutbol/2009/09/la-copa-principe-de-asturias/|title=La Copa Pr\u00edncipe de Asturias|trans-title=The Prince of Asturias Cup|language=es|publisher=[[:es:Centro de Investigaciones de Historia y Estad\u00edstica del F\u00fatbol Espa\u00f1ol|CIHEFE]]|author=Vicente Mart\u00ednez Calatrava|date=17 August 2009|accessdate=5 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Asturian Federation===\nOn 28 May 1918 the Cantabrian clubs moved back to the Northern Federation, so the Spanish Federation agreed to change the name of the Cantabric Federation to ''[[Royal Asturias Football Federation|Regional Asturian Federation of Football Clubs]].''

During the 1930s, the Asturian team continued playing several friendly games until the [[Spanish Civil War]].\n\n===Revival in the 2000s===\nOn 23 December 2000, the Royal Asturian Football Federation rescued the Regional team to play a friendly game at [[Estadio Carlos Tartiere]] against [[Macedonia national football team|Macedonia]]. [[Juanele]] scored the only goal of the match, with 30,000 people filling the stadium in [[Oviedo]].

Alford]] who is also known as \"The March King\". Among his best-known marches are \"[[The Stars and Stripes Forever]]\" (National March of the [[United States of America]]), \"[[Semper Fidelis (march)|Semper Fidelis]]\" (official march of the [[United States Marine Corps]]), \"[[The Liberty Bell (march)|The Liberty Bell]]\", \"[[The Thunderer]]\", and \"[[The Washington Post (march)|The Washington Post]]\".\n\nSousa began his career playing violin and studying music theory and composition under John Esputa and George Felix Benkert. His father enlisted him in the [[United States Marine Band]] as an apprentice in 1868. He left the band in 1875 and learned to conduct. From 1880 until his death, he focused exclusively on conducting and writing music. He eventually rejoined the Marine Band and served there for 12 years as director, after which he organized his own band. Sousa aided in the development of the [[sousaphone]], a large brass instrument similar to the [[helicon (instrument)|helicon]] and [[tuba]].\n\nUpon the outbreak of [[World War I]], Sousa was awarded a wartime commission of lieutenant commander to lead the Naval Reserve Band in Illinois. He then returned to conduct the Sousa Band until his death in 1932. (In the 1920s, he was promoted to the permanent rank of lieutenant commander in the naval reserve, but he never saw active service again.)\n\n==Early life and education==\n[[File:Sousa birthplace.jpg|upright|thumb|right|Sousa's birthplace on G St., S.E. in Washington, D.C.]]\nJohn Philip Sousa was born in Washington, D.C., the third of ten children of Jo\u00e3o Ant\u00f3nio de Sousa (John Anthony Sousa) (22 September 1824 \u2013 27 April 1892) who was born in Spain, though of Portuguese ancestry, and his wife Maria Elisabeth Trinkaus (20 May 1826 \u2013 25 August 1908) who was of German ancestry.<ref>Bierley 2001, p. 23, 241.</ref><ref name=\"JPSOUSA\">{{cite web|title = The Library of Congress Biography: John Philip Sousa|url= http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/ihas/loc.natlib.ihas.200152755/default.html|accessdate =January 10, 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101214183738/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/ihas/loc.natlib.ihas.200152755/default.html |archivedate = December 14, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>Warfield, Patrick.

He first enlisted on June 9, 1868 at age 13 as an apprentice musician, his rank listed as \"boy\". He re-enlisted on July 8, 1872 and was promoted to musician. He left the Marine Corps in 1875 at age 20. His second period of Marine service was from 1880 to 1892, during which he was the leader of the Marine Band in Washington, D.C. Some sources state that he served with the rank of Sergeant Major and was eventually promoted to Warrant Officer, but this is erroneous, as the leader of the band was a separate rank from sergeant major and the Marine Corps did not have warrant officers until 1916.<ref name=\"JPSOUSA\"/> The Marine Band became the premier military band in the United States under his leadership.\n\nThe [[Columbia Phonograph Company]] produced 60 recordings of the Marine Band conducted by Sousa which led to his national fame. In July 1892, Sousa requested a discharge from the Marine Corps to pursue a financially promising civilian career as a band leader. He conducted a farewell concert at the [[White House]] on July 30, 1892 and was discharged from the Marine Corps the next day.<ref>''The New York Times''.  August 1, 1892.{{Title missing|date=March 2019}}</ref>\n\nSousa was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Naval Reserve on May 31, 1917, shortly after the United States declared war on Germany and entered [[World War I]]. He was 62 years old, which was the mandatory retirement age for Navy officers. During the war, he led the Navy Band at the [[Naval Station Great Lakes|Great Lakes Naval Station]] near Chicago,<ref name=\"JPSOUSA\"/><ref>Bierley 2001, p. 250.</ref> and he donated all of his naval salary except a token $1 per month to the Sailors' and Marines' Relief Fund.<ref>Bierley 2001, p. 78.</ref> He was discharged from active duty after the war's end in November 1918 and returned to conducting his own band, but he continued to wear his naval uniform for many of his concerts and other public appearances. In the early 1920s, he was promoted to lieutenant commander in the Naval Reserve but did not return to active duty.  He frequently wore his Navy uniform during performances for the remainder of his life.\n\nFor this service during the war, Sousa received the [[World War I Victory Medal (United States)|World War I Victory Medal]] and was elected as a Veteran Companion of the [[Military Order of Foreign Wars]].  He was also a member [[New York Athletic Club]] Post 754 of the [[American Legion]].\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:John Philip Sousa Grave Washington DC.jpg|thumb|upright|John Philip Sousa's grave, [[Congressional Cemetery]]]]\nOn December 30, 1879, Sousa married Jane van Middlesworth Bellis (1862\u20131944),<ref name=\"JPSOUSA\"/> and their children were John Philip, Jr. (April 1, 1881 \u2013 May 18, 1937), Jane Priscilla (August 7, 1882 \u2013 October 28, 1958), and Helen (January 21, 1887 \u2013 October 14, 1975).<ref>{{cite web|last=McSherry Jr.|first=Jack L.|title=John Philip Sousa|url=http://www.spanamwar.com/Sousa.htm|work=The Spanish\u2013American War Centennial Website|accessdate=1 January 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> All were buried in the John Philip Sousa plot in the Congressional Cemetery.

Alford]] who is also known as \"The March King\". Among his best-known marches are \"[[The Stars and Stripes Forever]]\" (National March of the [[United States of America]]), \"[[Semper Fidelis (march)|Semper Fidelis]]\" (official march of the [[United States Marine Corps]]), \"[[The Liberty Bell (march)|The Liberty Bell]]\", \"[[The Thunderer]]\", and \"[[The Washington Post (march)|The Washington Post]]\".\n\nSousa began his career playing violin and studying music theory and composition under John Esputa and George Felix Benkert. His father enlisted him in the [[United States Marine Band]] as an apprentice in 1868. He left the band in 1875 and learned to conduct. From 1880 until his death, he focused exclusively on conducting and writing music. He eventually rejoined the Marine Band and served there for 12 years as director, after which he organized his own band. Sousa aided in the development of the [[sousaphone]], a large brass instrument similar to the [[helicon (instrument)|helicon]] and [[tuba]].\n\nUpon the outbreak of [[World War I]], Sousa was awarded a wartime commission of lieutenant commander to lead the Naval Reserve Band in Illinois. He then returned to conduct the Sousa Band until his death in 1932. (In the 1920s, he was promoted to the permanent rank of lieutenant commander in the naval reserve, but he never saw active service again.)\n\n==Early life and education==\n[[File:Sousa birthplace.jpg|upright|thumb|right|Sousa's birthplace on G St., S.E. in Washington, D.C.]]\nJohn Philip Sousa was born in Washington, D.C., the third of ten children of Jo\u00e3o Ant\u00f3nio de Sousa (John Anthony Sousa) (22 September 1824 \u2013 27 April 1892) who was born in Spain, though of Portuguese ancestry, and his wife Maria Elisabeth Trinkaus (20 May 1826 \u2013 25 August 1908) who was of German ancestry.<ref>Bierley 2001, p. 23, 241.</ref><ref name=\"JPSOUSA\">{{cite web|title = The Library of Congress Biography: John Philip Sousa|url= http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/ihas/loc.natlib.ihas.200152755/default.html|accessdate =January 10, 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101214183738/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/ihas/loc.natlib.ihas.200152755/default.html |archivedate = December 14, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>Warfield, Patrick.

He first enlisted on June 9, 1868 at age 13 as an apprentice musician, his rank listed as \"boy\". He re-enlisted on July 8, 1872 and was promoted to musician. He left the Marine Corps in 1875 at age 20. His second period of Marine service was from 1880 to 1892, during which he was the leader of the Marine Band in Washington, D.C. Some sources state that he served with the rank of Sergeant Major and was eventually promoted to Warrant Officer, but this is erroneous, as the leader of the band was a separate rank from sergeant major and the Marine Corps did not have warrant officers until 1916.<ref name=\"JPSOUSA\"/> The Marine Band became the premier military band in the United States under his leadership.\n\nThe [[Columbia Phonograph Company]] produced 60 recordings of the Marine Band conducted by Sousa which led to his national fame. In July 1892, Sousa requested a discharge from the Marine Corps to pursue a financially promising civilian career as a band leader. He conducted a farewell concert at the [[White House]] on July 30, 1892 and was discharged from the Marine Corps the next day.<ref>''The New York Times''.  August 1, 1892.{{Title missing|date=March 2019}}</ref>\n\nSousa was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Naval Reserve on May 31, 1917, shortly after the United States declared war on Germany and entered [[World War I]]. He was 62 years old, which was the mandatory retirement age for Navy officers. During the war, he led the Navy Band at the [[Naval Station Great Lakes|Great Lakes Naval Station]] near Chicago,<ref name=\"JPSOUSA\"/><ref>Bierley 2001, p. 250.</ref> and he donated all of his naval salary except a token $1 per month to the Sailors' and Marines' Relief Fund.<ref>Bierley 2001, p. 78.</ref> He was discharged from active duty after the war's end in November 1918 and returned to conducting his own band, but he continued to wear his naval uniform for many of his concerts and other public appearances. In the early 1920s, he was promoted to lieutenant commander in the Naval Reserve but did not return to active duty.  He frequently wore his Navy uniform during performances for the remainder of his life.\n\nFor this service during the war, Sousa received the [[World War I Victory Medal (United States)|World War I Victory Medal]] and was elected as a Veteran Companion of the [[Military Order of Foreign Wars]].  He was also a member [[New York Athletic Club]] Post 754 of the [[American Legion]].\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:John Philip Sousa Grave Washington DC.jpg|thumb|upright|John Philip Sousa's grave, [[Congressional Cemetery]]]]\nOn December 30, 1879, Sousa married Jane van Middlesworth Bellis (1862\u20131944),<ref name=\"JPSOUSA\"/> and their children were John Philip, Jr. (April 1, 1881 \u2013 May 18, 1937), Jane Priscilla (August 7, 1882 \u2013 October 28, 1958), and Helen (January 21, 1887 \u2013 October 14, 1975).<ref>{{cite web|last=McSherry Jr.|first=Jack L.|title=John Philip Sousa|url=http://www.spanamwar.com/Sousa.htm|work=The Spanish\u2013American War Centennial Website|accessdate=1 January 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> All were buried in the John Philip Sousa plot in the Congressional Cemetery.

One was to regain the traditional status (both legal and political) of the Hungarian state, which was lost after the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]]. The other was to restore the series of reform laws of the revolutionary parliament of 1848, which were based on the [[12 points of the Hungarian Revolutionaries of 1848|12 points]] that established modern civil and political rights, economic and societal reforms in Hungary.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ferenc Szak\u00e1ly|title=Hungary and Eastern Europe: Research Report Volume 182 of Studia historica Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae|year=1980|page=178|publisher=Akad\u00e9miai Kiad\u00f3|isbn=9789630525954}}</ref> Even the [[April Laws]] of the Hungarian revolutionary parliament (with the exception of the laws based on the 9th and 10th points) were restored by Francis Joseph. \n\nUnder the Compromise, the lands of the [[House of Habsburg]] were reorganized as a [[real union]] between the Austrian Empire and the Kingdom of Hungary, headed by a single monarch who reigned as Emperor of Austria in the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] half of the empire, and as King of Hungary in [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. The [[Cisleithania]]n (Austrian) and [[Transleithania]]n (Hungarian) states were governed by separate parliaments and prime ministers. The two countries conducted unified foreign diplomatic and defense policies. For these purposes, \"common\" ministries of foreign affairs and defence were maintained under the monarch's direct authority, as was a third ministry responsible only for financing the two \"common\" portfolios.\n\nThe compromise remained bitterly unpopular among the ethnic Hungarian voters<ref>Cieger Andr\u00e1s.

In 1526, Hungary was defeated and partially conquered by the Ottoman Empire. King [[Louis II of Hungary|Louis II of Hungary and Bohemia]] had no legitimate heir and died young in the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]].

From 1526 to 1804, Hungary was ruled by the Habsburg dynasty as [[King of Hungary|kings of Hungary]], but remained nominally and legally separate from the other lands of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]].\nUnlike other Habsburg ruled areas, Kingdom of Hungary had an [[Uncodified constitution|old historic constitution]],<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert Young|title=Secession of Quebec and the Future of Canada|publisher=[[McGill-Queen's Press]]|year=1995|page=[https://archive.org/details/secessionofquebe0000youn/page/138 138]|isbn=9780773565470|url=https://archive.org/details/secessionofquebe0000youn|url-access=registration|quote=the Hungarian constitution was restored.}}</ref> which limited the power of the Crown and greatly increased the authority of the parliament since the 13th century.\n\nIn 1804, [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor]], who was also ruler of the lands of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], founded the Empire of Austria in which all his lands were included. In doing so he created a formal overarching structure for the Habsburg Monarchy, which had functioned as a [[composite monarchy]] for about 300 years. (Composite states/monarchies were the most common / dominant form of states in early modern era Europe.<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert I.

Frost }}</ref>) Until the 1848 revolution, the workings of the overarching structure and the status of Hungary stayed much the same as they had been before 1804. The Kingdom of Hungary had always been considered a separate realm, the country's status was affirmed by Article X, which was added to Hungary's constitution in 1790 during the phase of the composite monarchy; it described the state as a ''Regnum Independens''. Hungary's affairs continued to be administered by its own institutions (King and Diet) as they had been previously. Thus, under the new arrangements, no imperial institutions were involved in its internal government.<ref>{{Citation|last=Laszlo|first=P\u00e9ter|title=Hungary's Long Nineteenth Century: Constitutional and Democratic Traditions |publisher=Koninklijke Brill NV |location=Leiden, Netherlands |year=2011|page=6 }}</ref> From the perspective of the Court since 1723, ''regnum Hungariae'' had been a hereditary province of the dynasty's three main branches on both lines. From the perspective of the ''orsz\u00e1g'' (the country), Hungary was ''regnum independens'', a separate Land as Article X of 1790 stipulated. In 1804 Emperor Franz assumed the title of Emperor of Austria for all the ''[[Erblande]]'' of the dynasty and for the other Lands, including Hungary. Thus Hungary formally became part of the Empire of Austria. The Holy Roman Empire was abolished in 1806. The Court reassured the diet, however, that the assumption of the monarch's new title (Emperor of Austria) did not in any sense affect the laws and the constitution of Hungary.<ref>\"Vor dem Jahr 1848 is[t] das Kaisertum \u00d6sterreich verfassungsrechtlich als ein monarchischer Einheitsstaat auf differenziert f\u00f6deralistischer Grundlage zu sehen, wobei die besondere Stel[l]ung Ungarns im Rahmen dieses Gesamtstaates stets offenkundig war.

In 1804 Emperor Franz assumed the title of Emperor of Austria for all the ''[[Erblande]]'' of the dynasty and for the other Lands, including Hungary. Thus Hungary formally became part of the Empire of Austria. The Holy Roman Empire was abolished in 1806.

The members of the delegates from the two parliaments had no right to give speeches, to debate or introduce new ideas during the meetings, thus they were nothing more than the extended arms of their own parliaments. The only function of the delegates was to transfer the votes according to the previously made decisions of their political fractions from the Austrian and the Hungarian parliaments. All common decisions had to be ratified by the Austrian parliament to be valid on Austrian territory, and by the Hungarian parliament to be valid on the territory of Kingdom of Hungary.<ref>{{cite book |author=Istv\u00e1n Bib\u00f3|title=The Art of Peacemaking: Political Essays by Istv\u00e1n Bib\u00f3|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|year=2015|page=208|isbn=9780300210262|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Q0TwBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA208&dq=%22Austria-Hungary%22+%22common+parliament%22#v=onepage&q=%22Austria-Hungary%22%20%22common%20parliament%22&f=false|author-link=Istv\u00e1n Bib\u00f3}}</ref>\n* A common Ministry of Foreign Affairs was created, responsible for diplomacy and foreign policy. \n* There was no common citizenship in Austria\u2013Hungary: one was either an Austrian citizen or a Hungarian citizen, never both.<ref>{{cite book |author=Eric Roman|title=Austria-Hungary & the Successor States: A Reference Guide from the Renaissance to the Present European nations Facts on File library of world history|publisher=Infobase Publishing|year=2003|page=401|isbn=9780816074693|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EvCfTIsTOskC&pg=PA401&lpg=PA401&dq=%22+there+was+no+common+citizenship%22#v=onepage&q=%22%20there%20was%20no%20common%20citizenship%22&f=false}}</ref> Austria\u2013Hungary used two separate passports: the Austrian passport and the Hungarian one.

The ethnic minorities had the key role in the political maintenance of the compromise in Hungary, because they were able to vote the pro-compromise liberal parties into the position of the majority/ruling parties of the Hungarian parliament. The pro-compromise liberal parties were the most popular among ethnic minority voters, however i.e. the Slovak, Serb and Romanian minority parties remained unpopular among their own ethnic minority voters. The coalitions of Hungarian nationalist parties \u2013 which were supported by the overwhelming majority of ethnic Hungarian voters \u2013 always remained in the opposition, with the exception of the 1906\u20131910 period, where the Hungarian-supported nationalist parties were able to form a government.<ref>Andr\u00e1s Ger\u0151 (2014).

Ultimately, although the Compromise hoped to fix the problems faced by a multi-national state while maintaining the benefits of a large state, the new system still faced the same internal pressures as the old.
