By default, Player 1 and Player 2 can only play one after another; in the Service Mode though, simultaneous gameplay can be enabled. Along with the ship's primary weapons, the player also has access to three bombs: one that can make a wave of fire that starts from behind the player's ship and scrolls \"up\" the screen, one that makes a powerful circular, nova-like blast, and one that shoots several mini-missiles capable of homing in on multiple targets. The game has six stages.\n\n==Development and release==\n''Viewpoint'' was developed by [[Aicom]] and published by [[Sammy Corporation]] in November 1992. It was one of Sammy's first forays into the video game industry after a lengthy hiatus in the 1980s. It was produced for the [[Neo Geo]] hardware family, specifically the [[Neo Geo (system)|Neo Geo MVS]] arcade system board.\n\n''Viewpoint'' also saw release on a variety of home platforms, including the [[Sega Genesis]] and [[PlayStation (console)|Sony PlayStation]] game consoles, as well as the [[Sharp X68000]] and [[FM Towns]] computer platforms. A port for the [[Sega Saturn]] was due in 1996;<ref>{{cite news|last= |first= |title=It Depends on Your Viewpoint|work=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]|issue=7|publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=May 1996|page=8}}</ref> however, it was cancelled.

G. N.|date=1999-07-22|website=IGN|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-26}}</ref> but it was cancelled.\n\nThe Genesis version features a sound and graphical style similar the Neo-Geo arcade game, but has considerably fewer enemies, a lower color palette and suffers from slowdown. The Sony PlayStation version, developed by Visual Concepts, featured re-done visuals and sound while the gameplay itself remains true to the original game with level layouts and boss/enemy patterns remaining the same. The X68000 version, trimmed down like the Genesis version, is similar to that port in terms of sound and visual style. The FM Towns platform received the truest-to-arcade port, although it suffers the occasional slowdown.\n\n== Reception ==\n{{Video game reviews\n| Allgame = Arcade: 17.5 / 20<ref>{{cite web |last=Biondich |first=Paul |url=//www.allgame.com/game.php?id=11493&tab=review |title=Viewpoint - Review - allgame |website=Web.archive.org |date=2014-12-12 |accessdate=2016-03-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141212065514/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=11493&tab=review |archivedate=December 12, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> <br /> Neo Geo: 17.5 / 20<ref>{{cite web |last=Biondich |first=Paul |url=//www.allgame.com/game.php?id=14204&tab=review |title=Viewpoint - Review - allgame |website=Web.archive.org |date=2014-12-12 |accessdate=2016-03-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141212065516/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=14204&tab=review |archivedate=December 12, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> <br /> Genesis: 11 / 20<ref>{{cite web |last=Michael |first=Christopher |url=//www.allgame.com/game.php?id=12531&tab=review |title=Viewpoint - Review - allgame |website=Web.archive.org |date=2014-11-16 |accessdate=2016-03-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141116034121/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=12531&tab=review |archivedate=November 16, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> <br /> PS1: 11 / 20<ref>{{cite web |last=Sackenheim |first=Shawn |url=//www.allgame.com/game.php?id=2346&tab=review |title=Viewpoint - Review - allgame |website=Web.archive.org |date=2014-12-11 |accessdate=2016-03-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211012111/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=2346&tab=review |archivedate=December 11, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n| CVG = Arcade: 95%<ref name=\"CVG\">{{cite web|url=http://www.solvalou.com/subpage/arcade_reviews/225/385/viewpoint_review.html |title=Viewpoint arcade game review |website=Solvalou.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-11}}</ref>\n| EGM = Genesis: 35 / 50<ref name=\"egm65\"/> <br /> PS1: 30.5 / 40<ref name=\"egm78\"/>\n| Fam = Neo Geo: 30 / 40<ref name=\"Fam\"/>\n| GameFan = Neo Geo: 198.5 / 200<ref name=\"GameFan\"/> <br /> PS1: 233 / 300<ref>''GameFan'', volume 4, issue 1 (January 1996), page 16</ref>\n| GMaster = Neo Geo: 93%<ref>''[[GamesMaster (magazine)|GamesMaster]]'', issue 9 (September 1993), pages 62-63 (published 19 August 1993)</ref> <br /> PS1: 89%<ref name=\"GMasterPS1\">''[[GamesMaster]]'', episode 90 ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwZdroNphXA&list=PL1F94E85D47458A50 series 5, episode 10]), November 23, 1995</ref>\n| Play = PS1: 74%<ref>''Play'', issue 2 (December 1995), pages 60-61 (published 16 November 1995)</ref>\n| rev1 = ''Maximum''\n| rev1Score = PS1: {{rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"Max2\"/>\n| NGen = Genesis: {{rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"NGen3\"/><br />PS1: {{rating|1|5}}<ref name=\"NGen13\"/>\n| rev3 = ''{{ill|Player One (magazine)|lt=Player One|fr|Player One|vertical-align=sup}}''\n| rev3Score = Neo Geo: 97%<ref name=\"player1\"/>\n| rev4 = ''[[Sinclair User]]''\n| rev4Score = Arcade: 96%<ref name=\"Sinclair\">{{cite web|url=http://www.solvalou.com/subpage/arcade_reviews/157/385/viewpoint_review.html |title=Viewpoint arcade game review |website=Solvalou.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-11}}</ref>\n| rev5 = ''{{ill|Video Games (magazine)|lt=Video Games|de|Video Games|vertical-align=sup}}''\n| rev5Score = Neo Geo: 84%<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ninretro.de/game-12-2634.html |title=Viewpoint (Neo Geo) - N.i.n.Retro (New is not Retro) v3 |website=Ninretro.de |date= |accessdate=2016-03-11}}</ref> <br /> Mega Drive: 70%<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ninretro.de/game-4-746.html |title=Viewpoint (Mega Drive) - N.i.n.Retro (New is not Retro) v3 |website=Ninretro.de |date= |accessdate=2016-03-11}}</ref> <br /> PS1: 70%<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ninretro.de/game-10-1998.html |title=Viewpoint (PlayStation) - N.i.n.Retro (New is not Retro) v3 |website=Ninretro.de |date= |accessdate=2016-03-11}}</ref>\n| award1Pub = ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]''\n| award1 = Best Graphics in a Video Game<ref name=\"egmbuyersguide1993\"/>\n| award2Pub = ''Electronic Gaming Monthly''\n| award2 = Best Music in a Video Game<ref name=\"egmbuyersguide1993\"/>\n| award3Pub = [[GameFan|''GameFan'' Megawards]]\n| award3 = Best Shooter (Genesis)<ref>''GameFan'', volume 3, issue 1 (January 1995), pages 68-75</ref>\n}}\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\nThe Neo Geo version received a positive critical reception.

The Sony PlayStation version, developed by Visual Concepts, featured re-done visuals and sound while the gameplay itself remains true to the original game with level layouts and boss/enemy patterns remaining the same. The X68000 version, trimmed down like the Genesis version, is similar to that port in terms of sound and visual style. The FM Towns platform received the truest-to-arcade port, although it suffers the occasional slowdown.\n\n== Reception ==\n{{Video game reviews\n| Allgame = Arcade: 17.5 / 20<ref>{{cite web |last=Biondich |first=Paul |url=//www.allgame.com/game.php?id=11493&tab=review |title=Viewpoint - Review - allgame |website=Web.archive.org |date=2014-12-12 |accessdate=2016-03-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141212065514/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=11493&tab=review |archivedate=December 12, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> <br /> Neo Geo: 17.5 / 20<ref>{{cite web |last=Biondich |first=Paul |url=//www.allgame.com/game.php?id=14204&tab=review |title=Viewpoint - Review - allgame |website=Web.archive.org |date=2014-12-12 |accessdate=2016-03-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141212065516/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=14204&tab=review |archivedate=December 12, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> <br /> Genesis: 11 / 20<ref>{{cite web |last=Michael |first=Christopher |url=//www.allgame.com/game.php?id=12531&tab=review |title=Viewpoint - Review - allgame |website=Web.archive.org |date=2014-11-16 |accessdate=2016-03-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141116034121/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=12531&tab=review |archivedate=November 16, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> <br /> PS1: 11 / 20<ref>{{cite web |last=Sackenheim |first=Shawn |url=//www.allgame.com/game.php?id=2346&tab=review |title=Viewpoint - Review - allgame |website=Web.archive.org |date=2014-12-11 |accessdate=2016-03-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211012111/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=2346&tab=review |archivedate=December 11, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n| CVG = Arcade: 95%<ref name=\"CVG\">{{cite web|url=http://www.solvalou.com/subpage/arcade_reviews/225/385/viewpoint_review.html |title=Viewpoint arcade game review |website=Solvalou.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-11}}</ref>\n| EGM = Genesis: 35 / 50<ref name=\"egm65\"/> <br /> PS1: 30.5 / 40<ref name=\"egm78\"/>\n| Fam = Neo Geo: 30 / 40<ref name=\"Fam\"/>\n| GameFan = Neo Geo: 198.5 / 200<ref name=\"GameFan\"/> <br /> PS1: 233 / 300<ref>''GameFan'', volume 4, issue 1 (January 1996), page 16</ref>\n| GMaster = Neo Geo: 93%<ref>''[[GamesMaster (magazine)|GamesMaster]]'', issue 9 (September 1993), pages 62-63 (published 19 August 1993)</ref> <br /> PS1: 89%<ref name=\"GMasterPS1\">''[[GamesMaster]]'', episode 90 ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwZdroNphXA&list=PL1F94E85D47458A50 series 5, episode 10]), November 23, 1995</ref>\n| Play = PS1: 74%<ref>''Play'', issue 2 (December 1995), pages 60-61 (published 16 November 1995)</ref>\n| rev1 = ''Maximum''\n| rev1Score = PS1: {{rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"Max2\"/>\n| NGen = Genesis: {{rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"NGen3\"/><br />PS1: {{rating|1|5}}<ref name=\"NGen13\"/>\n| rev3 = ''{{ill|Player One (magazine)|lt=Player One|fr|Player One|vertical-align=sup}}''\n| rev3Score = Neo Geo: 97%<ref name=\"player1\"/>\n| rev4 = ''[[Sinclair User]]''\n| rev4Score = Arcade: 96%<ref name=\"Sinclair\">{{cite web|url=http://www.solvalou.com/subpage/arcade_reviews/157/385/viewpoint_review.html |title=Viewpoint arcade game review |website=Solvalou.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-11}}</ref>\n| rev5 = ''{{ill|Video Games (magazine)|lt=Video Games|de|Video Games|vertical-align=sup}}''\n| rev5Score = Neo Geo: 84%<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ninretro.de/game-12-2634.html |title=Viewpoint (Neo Geo) - N.i.n.Retro (New is not Retro) v3 |website=Ninretro.de |date= |accessdate=2016-03-11}}</ref> <br /> Mega Drive: 70%<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ninretro.de/game-4-746.html |title=Viewpoint (Mega Drive) - N.i.n.Retro (New is not Retro) v3 |website=Ninretro.de |date= |accessdate=2016-03-11}}</ref> <br /> PS1: 70%<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ninretro.de/game-10-1998.html |title=Viewpoint (PlayStation) - N.i.n.Retro (New is not Retro) v3 |website=Ninretro.de |date= |accessdate=2016-03-11}}</ref>\n| award1Pub = ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]''\n| award1 = Best Graphics in a Video Game<ref name=\"egmbuyersguide1993\"/>\n| award2Pub = ''Electronic Gaming Monthly''\n| award2 = Best Music in a Video Game<ref name=\"egmbuyersguide1993\"/>\n| award3Pub = [[GameFan|''GameFan'' Megawards]]\n| award3 = Best Shooter (Genesis)<ref>''GameFan'', volume 3, issue 1 (January 1995), pages 68-75</ref>\n}}\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\nThe Neo Geo version received a positive critical reception.

It is located {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} north of [[Seattle]] and is one of the main cities in the [[Seattle metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] and [[Puget Sound region]]. Everett is the [[List of cities and towns in Washington|seventh-largest]] city in Washington state and had a total population of 103,019 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The city is located at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]] along [[Port Gardner Bay]], an inlet of [[Possession Sound]] (itself part of [[Puget Sound]]).\n\nAmerican settlement on the Everett peninsula began in the 1860s, with several [[sawmill]]s built to serve the area's growing timber industry. Everett was [[plat]]ted by a group of investors seeking to build an industrial city and named for the son of co-founder Charles L. Colby. The city was [[municipal incorporation|incorporated]] in 1893, shortly after the arrival of the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]], and prospered as a major industrial center. Everett's economy transitioned away from lumber and towards aviation after [[World War II]], with the construction of [[Boeing]]'s [[Boeing Everett Factory|aircraft assembly plant]] at [[Paine Field]] in 1967. Boeing remains the city's largest employer, alongside the [[U.S. Navy]], which has operated [[Naval Station Everett]] since 1992. Everett received an [[All-America City Award]] in 2002.\n\nEverett remains a major employment center for Snohomish County, but has also become a [[bedroom community]] for Seattle in recent decades. It is connected to Seattle by [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]] and various public transit services at [[Everett Station]], including the [[Sounder commuter rail|Sounder commuter train]], [[Amtrak]], and commuter buses.\n\n==History==\n[[File:everettwaterfront.jpg|thumb| [[Weyerhaeuser]] Lumber Mill, Everett Waterfront, c. early 1900s]]\n\nThe [[Port Gardner]] peninsula was originally inhabited by local [[Coast Salish]] tribes who arrived in the region 10,000 years [[before present]] and settled near modern-day Everett approximately 2,000 years [[before present]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}} The [[Snohomish people]] lived around local waterways in the [[Possession Sound]] estuary and had a permanent winter village at Hibulb (also called Hebolb) at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}}<ref>{{cite news |last=Whitely |first=Peyton |date=March 16, 2005 |title=Aerial photos show 2 very different cities |page=H8 |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/aerial-photos-show-2-very-different-cities/ |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The area was explored by the [[Vancouver Expedition]] of 1792, which landed on a beach on the modern Everett waterfront on June 4 and claimed the land for [[England]].<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Federal Writers' Project]] |year=1941 |title=The WPA Guide to Washington: The Evergreen State |pages=186\u2013200 |series=[[American Guide Series]] |publisher=[[Works Progress Administration]] |oclc=881468746 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=07PpCAAAQBAJ |via=Google Books |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The Snohomish and other tribes signed the [[Treaty of Point Elliott]] in 1855, \nrelocating to the nearby [[Tulalip Indian Reservation]] and relinquishing its lands to the [[Washington Territory|territorial government]], opening the region to American settlement.<ref name=\"Herald-125th\">{{cite news |last=Muhlstein |first=Julie |date=May 9, 2018 |title=City of Everett to celebrate 125th birthday with big party |url=https://www.heraldnet.com/news/city-of-everett-celebrates-125-years-and-counting/ |work=[[The Everett Herald]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe first permanent American settler to arrive on the peninsula was Dennis Brigham, a carpenter from [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], who claimed a {{convert|160|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} [[Homestead Acts|homestead]] on Port Gardner Bay in 1861 and built a cabin for himself. He was joined by several other families on their own homesteads, which included the establishment of a general store and a [[sawmill]] that quickly went out of business.<ref name=\"HistoryLink\">{{cite web |last=Oakley |first=Janet |date=July 26, 2005 |title=Everett \u2014 Thumbnail History |url=http://www.historylink.org/File/7397 |work=[[HistoryLink]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> Over the next several years a handful of settlers moved to the area, but it wasn't until 1890 that plans for platting a town were conceived.\n\nOn July 17, 1890, The steamship ''[[Queen of the Pacific]]'' left [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] for an Alaskan cruise with [[Henry Hewitt, Jr.]] and [[Charles L. Colby]] aboard. During this \"Fateful voyage\" initial plans for an industrial city on the peninsula along the banks of the Snohomish river were formulated. On August 22, 1890, The [[Rucker Brothers]] filed their [[plat]] at Port Gardner, a {{convert|50|acre|m2|adj=on}} townsite on the bayfront side of what is now the city of Everett. This plat was later withdrawn to accommodate the plans of the Hewitt-Colby group.\n\nOn September 1, 1890, Henry Hewitt filed a bond on the Davis tract at the north end of what was to become the Everett town site, beginning the process of acquisition that would become the Everett Land Company later along with Charles L. Colby and [[Colgate Hoyt]]. In October 1890, the Hewitt-Colby syndicate decided to name their industrial city after Everett Colby, the fifteen-year-old son of investor Charles L. Colby, who had displayed a prodigious appetite at dinner. Everett Colby in turn was named for orator [[Edward Everett]].\n\nOn November 19, 1890, the Articles of Incorporation for the Everett Land Company were filed, with Henry Hewitt Jr. as president. On November 26, 1890, the Rucker Brothers transferred {{convert|434.15|acre|km2}} of property on the Everett peninsula to Hewitt. Three days later, \"The Remarkable Document\" was drafted, setting the terms by which the Rucker Brothers would donate half their remaining holdings to Hewitt in exchange for promises of specific development.\n\nThe Company bought much of the Ruckers' land, taking them in as junior partners. Everett was officially incorporated on May 4, 1893, the year the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]] came to the town. Both Hewitt and the Ruckers had speculated that [[James J. Hill]] would make the town the terminus of his railroad. However Hill continued the railroad along the shore of [[Puget Sound]] to [[Seattle]]. Although it succeeded in building the city, the Everett Land Company was a failure for its investors. The outside investors withdrew, and the Company's holdings were transferred to a new company controlled by Hill. The Ruckers, who helped broker the deal, stayed in Everett and became leading citizens of the young city.\n\nRailroads and mines played a part in Everett's future. The mining community of [[Monte Cristo, Washington|Monte Cristo]] depended on a railway for supplies. It was hoped that the railroad would cross the mountains and bring in traffic. For a while ore was smelted in Everett, then sawmilling and port activity commenced. A dozen steam riverboats were built in Everett for the [[Klondike Gold Rush|Yukon gold rush]].\n\nSeveral survivors of the [[Bellingham riots]] settled in Everett for two months, until they were beaten and forcefully evicted by a mob on November 5, 1907. Everett also was the site of the [[Everett Massacre]] of 1916 in which a posse led by local Sheriff Donald McRae shot and killed five [[Industrial Workers of the World]] members. The IWW members on the [[Verona (steamship)|steamer ''Verona'']] travelled from Seattle to support strikers in Everett and sought to land, but McRae and his posse of deputized civilians blocked the harbor. Shooting broke out and at least five IWW members were killed, along with two in the posse who were deemed to have been killed by friendly fire.\n\nEverett streets are named after each of the three founders. Adjacent streets Colby Avenue and Hoyt Avenue run north and south and are intersected by Hewitt Avenue running east and west just south of the [[BNSF Railway]] tracks cutting across Everett. There are several other streets named for their associates such as Bond Street named for Judge [[Hiram Bond]], President of the Everett & Monte Cristo Railroad. Parallel to Colby and Hoyt are avenues named for other investors, [[John D. Rockefeller]], railroad executive [[Thomas Fletcher Oakes|T.F. Oakes]], shipbuilder [[Alexander McDougall (1845-1923)|Alexander McDougall]], and McDougall's associate [[Charles W. Wetmore]].\n\nDuring the [[Great Depression]], the [[Works Progress Administration]] was tasked with construction of several public works projects in the Everett area, including a new county airport that later became [[Paine Field]]. The airport was appropriated for military use during [[World War II]], but was later turned over to county ownership.<ref name=\"HistoryLink\"/> The [[Boeing Company]] selected a {{convert|780|acre|ha|adj=mid}} plot of land north of the airport in June 1966 to build a [[Boeing Everett Factory|new airplane factory]] for its [[Boeing 747]] passenger jetliner, which would become the world's first \"jumbo jet\".

It is located {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} north of [[Seattle]] and is one of the main cities in the [[Seattle metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] and [[Puget Sound region]]. Everett is the [[List of cities and towns in Washington|seventh-largest]] city in Washington state and had a total population of 103,019 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The city is located at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]] along [[Port Gardner Bay]], an inlet of [[Possession Sound]] (itself part of [[Puget Sound]]).\n\nAmerican settlement on the Everett peninsula began in the 1860s, with several [[sawmill]]s built to serve the area's growing timber industry. Everett was [[plat]]ted by a group of investors seeking to build an industrial city and named for the son of co-founder Charles L. Colby. The city was [[municipal incorporation|incorporated]] in 1893, shortly after the arrival of the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]], and prospered as a major industrial center. Everett's economy transitioned away from lumber and towards aviation after [[World War II]], with the construction of [[Boeing]]'s [[Boeing Everett Factory|aircraft assembly plant]] at [[Paine Field]] in 1967. Boeing remains the city's largest employer, alongside the [[U.S. Navy]], which has operated [[Naval Station Everett]] since 1992. Everett received an [[All-America City Award]] in 2002.\n\nEverett remains a major employment center for Snohomish County, but has also become a [[bedroom community]] for Seattle in recent decades. It is connected to Seattle by [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]] and various public transit services at [[Everett Station]], including the [[Sounder commuter rail|Sounder commuter train]], [[Amtrak]], and commuter buses.\n\n==History==\n[[File:everettwaterfront.jpg|thumb| [[Weyerhaeuser]] Lumber Mill, Everett Waterfront, c. early 1900s]]\n\nThe [[Port Gardner]] peninsula was originally inhabited by local [[Coast Salish]] tribes, including the [[Snohomish people|Snohomish]], who maintained a winter village at Hibulb (also called Hebolb) at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Whitely |first=Peyton |date=March 16, 2005 |title=Aerial photos show 2 very different cities |page=H8 |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/aerial-photos-show-2-very-different-cities/ |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The area was explored by the [[Vancouver Expedition]] of 1792, which landed on a beach on the modern Everett waterfront on June 4 and claimed the land for [[England]].<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Federal Writers' Project]] |year=1941 |title=The WPA Guide to Washington: The Evergreen State |pages=186\u2013200 |series=[[American Guide Series]] |publisher=[[Works Progress Administration]] |oclc=881468746 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=07PpCAAAQBAJ |via=Google Books |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The Snohomish and other tribes signed the [[Treaty of Point Elliott]] in 1855, \nrelocating to the nearby [[Tulalip Indian Reservation]] and relinquishing its lands to the [[Washington Territory|territorial government]], opening the region to American settlement.<ref name=\"Herald-125th\">{{cite news |last=Muhlstein |first=Julie |date=May 9, 2018 |title=City of Everett to celebrate 125th birthday with big party |url=https://www.heraldnet.com/news/city-of-everett-celebrates-125-years-and-counting/ |work=[[The Everett Herald]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe first permanent American settler to arrive on the peninsula was Dennis Brigham, a carpenter from [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], who claimed a {{convert|160|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} [[Homestead Acts|homestead]] on Port Gardner Bay in 1861 and built a cabin for himself. He was joined by several other families on their own homesteads, which included the establishment of a general store and a [[sawmill]] that quickly went out of business.<ref name=\"HistoryLink\">{{cite web |last=Oakley |first=Janet |date=July 26, 2005 |title=Everett \u2014 Thumbnail History |url=http://www.historylink.org/File/7397 |work=[[HistoryLink]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> Over the next several years a handful of settlers moved to the area, but it wasn't until 1890 that plans for platting a town were conceived.\n\nOn July 17, 1890, The steamship ''[[Queen of the Pacific]]'' left [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] for an Alaskan cruise with [[Henry Hewitt, Jr.]] and [[Charles L. Colby]] aboard. During this \"Fateful voyage\" initial plans for an industrial city on the peninsula along the banks of the Snohomish river were formulated. On August 22, 1890, The [[Rucker Brothers]] filed their [[plat]] at Port Gardner, a {{convert|50|acre|m2|adj=on}} townsite on the bayfront side of what is now the city of Everett. This plat was later withdrawn to accommodate the plans of the Hewitt-Colby group.\n\nOn September 1, 1890, Henry Hewitt filed a bond on the Davis tract at the north end of what was to become the Everett town site, beginning the process of acquisition that would become the Everett Land Company later along with Charles L. Colby and [[Colgate Hoyt]]. In October 1890, the Hewitt-Colby syndicate decided to name their industrial city after Everett Colby, the fifteen-year-old son of investor Charles L. Colby, who had displayed a prodigious appetite at dinner. Everett Colby in turn was named for orator [[Edward Everett]].\n\nOn November 19, 1890, the Articles of Incorporation for the Everett Land Company were filed, with Henry Hewitt Jr. as president. On November 26, 1890, the Rucker Brothers transferred {{convert|434.15|acre|km2}} of property on the Everett peninsula to Hewitt. Three days later, \"The Remarkable Document\" was drafted, setting the terms by which the Rucker Brothers would donate half their remaining holdings to Hewitt in exchange for promises of specific development.\n\nThe Company bought much of the Ruckers' land, taking them in as junior partners. Everett was officially incorporated on May 4, 1893, the year the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]] came to the town. Both Hewitt and the Ruckers had speculated that [[James J. Hill]] would make the town the terminus of his railroad. However Hill continued the railroad along the shore of [[Puget Sound]] to [[Seattle]]. Although it succeeded in building the city, the Everett Land Company was a failure for its investors. The outside investors withdrew, and the Company's holdings were transferred to a new company controlled by Hill. The Ruckers, who helped broker the deal, stayed in Everett and became leading citizens of the young city.\n\nRailroads and mines played a part in Everett's future. The mining community of [[Monte Cristo, Washington|Monte Cristo]] depended on a railway for supplies. It was hoped that the railroad would cross the mountains and bring in traffic. For a while ore was smelted in Everett, then sawmilling and port activity commenced. A dozen steam riverboats were built in Everett for the [[Klondike Gold Rush|Yukon gold rush]].\n\nSeveral survivors of the [[Bellingham riots]] settled in Everett for two months, until they were beaten and forcefully evicted by a mob on November 5, 1907. Everett also was the site of the [[Everett Massacre]] of 1916 in which a posse led by local Sheriff Donald McRae shot and killed five [[Industrial Workers of the World]] members. The IWW members on the [[Verona (steamship)|steamer ''Verona'']] travelled from Seattle to support strikers in Everett and sought to land, but McRae and his posse of deputized civilians blocked the harbor. Shooting broke out and at least five IWW members were killed, along with two in the posse who were deemed to have been killed by friendly fire.\n\nEverett streets are named after each of the three founders. Adjacent streets Colby Avenue and Hoyt Avenue run north and south and are intersected by Hewitt Avenue running east and west just south of the [[BNSF Railway]] tracks cutting across Everett. There are several other streets named for their associates such as Bond Street named for Judge [[Hiram Bond]], President of the Everett & Monte Cristo Railroad. Parallel to Colby and Hoyt are avenues named for other investors, [[John D. Rockefeller]], railroad executive [[Thomas Fletcher Oakes|T.F. Oakes]], shipbuilder [[Alexander McDougall (1845-1923)|Alexander McDougall]], and McDougall's associate [[Charles W. Wetmore]].\n\nDuring the [[Great Depression]], the [[Works Progress Administration]] was tasked with construction of several public works projects in the Everett area, including a new county airport that later became [[Paine Field]]. The airport was appropriated for military use during [[World War II]], but was later turned over to county ownership.<ref name=\"HistoryLink\"/> The [[Boeing Company]] selected a {{convert|780|acre|ha|adj=mid}} plot of land north of the airport in June 1966 to build a [[Boeing Everett Factory|new airplane factory]] for its [[Boeing 747]] passenger jetliner, which would become the world's first \"jumbo jet\".

One of the most selective actors in the Korean entertainment industry, he has starred in only five films to date, ''[[Guns & Talks]]'', ''[[Taegukgi (film)|Taegukgi]]'', ''[[My Brother (2004 film)|My Brother]]'', ''[[Mother (2009 film)|Mother]]'' and ''[[The Man from Nowhere (2010 film)|The Man from Nowhere]]''. <ref>{{cite news|last=Kang|first=Myoung-Seok|title=10LINE: Won Bin|url=http://www.asiae.co.kr/news/view.htm?idxno=2009093018441652110|accessdate=2 December 2012|newspaper=10 Asia|date=30 September 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Kang|first=Myoung-Seok|title=INTERVIEW: Actor Won Bin - Part 1|url=http://www.asiae.co.kr/news/view.htm?idxno=2010080423554490134|accessdate=2 December 2012|newspaper=10 Asia|date=4 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Kang|first=Myoung-Seok|title=INTERVIEW: Actor Won Bin - Part 2|url=http://www.asiae.co.kr/news/view.htm?idxno=2010080423553587071|accessdate=2 December 2012|newspaper=10 Asia|date=4 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Kang|first=Myoung-Seok|title=INTERVIEW: Actor Won Bin - Part 3|url=http://www.asiae.co.kr/news/view.htm?idxno=2010080423271185928|accessdate=2 December 2012|newspaper=10 Asia|date=4 August 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Early life==\nWon Bin was born and raised in [[Jeongseon County]] in [[Gangwon Province (South Korea)|Gangwon Province]], South Korea. He is the fifth and youngest child, with one brother and three sisters. His father was formerly employed in a mine and his mother worked on a farm; both of his parents are now retired. As was common for other children living in mountainous regions, Won Bin spent most of his time playing around with friends in the mountains and rivers, and later explained: \"I came back home most nights at sunset with a black and dusty face.\" He was frequently shy, introspective, and quiet, character traits that would continue to follow him throughout adulthood.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wonbin.yuku.com/topic/848 |title=Won Bin - A story behind the success |accessdate=2009-08-06 |work=Sports Seoul, Sep, 2000}}</ref> While not talkative or outgoing, he excelled at athletics. Won Bin started [[taekwondo]] lessons and now holds a [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]]. As a young boy, he initially planned to become a car mechanic due to his interest in car racing and motorcycling. Won Bin graduated from a mechanical high school, where he studied car repair and mechanics.\n\nIn November 1995, a [[cable television]] station was looking to recruit and hire new actors; Won Bin applied and was accepted in his last semester of high school. He started to take acting classes at the station's headquarters and appeared in several dramas. The following month, Won Bin signed an acting contract with a talent agency.\n\n== Career ==\nWon Bin made his screen debut with a supporting role in the 1997 drama film ''Propose''. His role in ''Ready Go!'' (1998) helped hone his acting chops. After ''Ready Go!'', he took a break and entered a college called Paekche Institute of the Arts in 1998 to take acting classes. In 1999, Won Bin came back to the screen with a lead role in drama ''Kwangki'' from which he was recognized as a promising young actor and a teen heartthrob.\n\nHe made his big breakthrough in 2000 with drama ''Tough Guy's Love'' (''Kkokji'') and ''[[Autumn in My Heart]]''. His role as a rebellious youngest son in ''Kkokji'' proved his acting potential and his role in the widely successful drama landed him on the A-list for Korean performers. ''[[Autumn in My Heart]]'' gained wide popularity in Asia and he became one of the most popular Korean actors in Korea and Asia as well. In 2002, Won Bin was involved in the first South Korea and Japan joint production drama ''[[Friends (2002 TV series)|Friends]]''.\n\nWon Bin also had roles in a number of popular films, including ''[[Guns & Talks]]'' and ''[[My Brother (2004 film)|My Brother]]'', but it is his portrayal of the sensitive younger brother in the blockbuster war film ''[[Taegukgi (film)|Taegukgi]]'' (2004) that cemented his international fame. With the success of the critically acclaimed ''Taegukgi'', recognition of his acting skills has reached an ever-wider international audience. ''Taegukgi'' was the best selling film in South Korea in 2004 with 11.75 million admissions.\n\nHis career was interrupted by his [[Conscription in South Korea|mandatory service]] to the [[Republic of Korea Army|South Korean Army]]. After graduating from the Graduate School of Arts in [[Yong-In University]] in 2005, Won Bin started his military duty in November 2005 and stationed at the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]], a position for which he volunteered.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://news3.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-01/10/content_4031451.htm |title=Won Bin heads for frontline army post |accessdate=2009-08-06 |work=[[Xinhua News Agency]], Jan 10, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6961GVbtT?url=http://news3.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-01/10/content_4031451.htm |archivedate=2012-07-12 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://english.donga.com/srv/service.php3?bicode=050000&biid=2006021173328 |title=Actor Won Bin Reports for DMZ Duty |accessdate=2009-08-06 |work=[[Dong-a Ilbo]], Feb 11, 2006}}</ref> On June 2, 2006, the military officially confirmed that Won Bin would be no longer active.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200606/200606020023.html |title=Star Discharged After Brief Stint With Frontline Unit |accessdate=2009-08-06 |work=[[The Chosun Ilbo]], Jun 2, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080419215008/http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200606/200606020023.html |archivedate=April 19, 2008 }}</ref> The decision was made by the military when Won Bin sustained injury to his [[Anterior cruciate ligament|ACL]].

One of the most selective actors in the Korean entertainment industry, he has starred in only five films to date, ''[[Guns & Talks]]'', ''[[Taegukgi (film)|Taegukgi]]'', ''[[My Brother (2004 film)|My Brother]]'', ''[[Mother (2009 film)|Mother]]'' and ''[[The Man from Nowhere (2010 film)|The Man from Nowhere]]''. <ref>{{cite news|last=Kang|first=Myoung-Seok|title=10LINE: Won Bin|url=http://www.asiae.co.kr/news/view.htm?idxno=2009093018441652110|accessdate=2 December 2012|newspaper=10 Asia|date=30 September 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Kang|first=Myoung-Seok|title=INTERVIEW: Actor Won Bin - Part 1|url=http://www.asiae.co.kr/news/view.htm?idxno=2010080423554490134|accessdate=2 December 2012|newspaper=10 Asia|date=4 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Kang|first=Myoung-Seok|title=INTERVIEW: Actor Won Bin - Part 2|url=http://www.asiae.co.kr/news/view.htm?idxno=2010080423553587071|accessdate=2 December 2012|newspaper=10 Asia|date=4 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Kang|first=Myoung-Seok|title=INTERVIEW: Actor Won Bin - Part 3|url=http://www.asiae.co.kr/news/view.htm?idxno=2010080423271185928|accessdate=2 December 2012|newspaper=10 Asia|date=4 August 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Early life==\nWon Bin was born and raised in [[Jeongseon County]] in [[Gangwon Province (South Korea)|Gangwon Province]], South Korea. He is the fifth and youngest child, with one brother and three sisters. His father was formerly employed in a mine and his mother worked on a farm; both of his parents are now retired. As was common for other children living in mountainous regions, Won Bin spent most of his time playing around with friends in the mountains and rivers, and later explained: \"I came back home most nights at sunset with a black and dusty face.\" He was frequently shy, introspective, and quiet, character traits that would continue to follow him throughout adulthood.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://wonbin.yuku.com/topic/848 |title=Won Bin - A story behind the success |accessdate=2009-08-06 |work=Sports Seoul, Sep, 2000}}</ref> While not talkative or outgoing, he excelled at athletics. Won Bin started [[taekwondo]] lessons and now holds a [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]]. As a young boy, he initially planned to become a car mechanic due to his interest in car racing and motorcycling. Won Bin graduated from a mechanical high school, where he studied car repair and mechanics.\n\nIn November 1995, a [[cable television]] station was looking to recruit and hire new actors; Won Bin applied and was accepted in his last semester of high school. He started to take acting classes at the station's headquarters and appeared in several dramas. The following month, Won Bin signed an acting contract with a talent agency.\n\n== Career ==\nWon Bin made his screen debut with a supporting role in the 1997 drama film ''Propose''. His role in ''Ready Go!'' (1998) helped hone his acting chops. After ''Ready Go!'', he took a break and entered a college called Paekche Institute of the Arts in 1998 to take acting classes. In 1999, Won Bin came back to the screen with a lead role in drama ''Kwangki'' from which he was recognized as a promising young actor and a teen heartthrob.\n\nHe made his big breakthrough in 2000 with drama ''Tough Guy's Love'' (''Kkokji'') and ''[[Autumn in My Heart]]''. His role as a rebellious youngest son in ''Kkokji'' proved his acting potential and his role in the widely successful drama landed him on the A-list for Korean performers. ''[[Autumn in My Heart]]'' gained wide popularity in Asia and he became one of the most popular Korean actors in Korea and Asia as well. In 2002, Won Bin was involved in the first South Korea and Japan joint production drama ''[[Friends (2002 TV series)|Friends]]''.\n\nWon Bin also had roles in a number of popular films, including ''[[Guns & Talks]]'' and ''[[My Brother (2004 film)|My Brother]]'', but it is his portrayal of the sensitive younger brother in the blockbuster war film ''[[Taegukgi (film)|Taegukgi]]'' (2004) that cemented his international fame.

During the eight months he spent bedridden after the accident, he saw an architect coming and going from a nearby construction site, \"with a blueprint under his arm and a pipe in his mouth.\" Moriyama decided then and there that he would become an architect too.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMoriyama's father was an outspoken pacifist who was arrested and made a Prisoner of War for his activism. Moriyama, at the age of twelve, was left to run the family hardware store along with his two sisters and pregnant mother. Shortly after, he and his family were forced out of Vancouver and confined to an [[Internment of Japanese Canadians|internment camp]] in the [[Slocan Valley]] of British Columbia during the Second World War.<ref name=\":0\" /> Japanese Canadians on the West Coast were classified as security threats, in a policy similar to that of the United States. He said these years were influential in his later career.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.magazine.utoronto.ca/all-about-alumni/raymond-moriyama-architect-canada-japanese-pow-camp/|work=U of T Magazine|accessdate=21 January 2012|title=The Architecture of a Life}}</ref>\n\nMoriyama has described his experiences in internment camps as miserable. During this time, his mother experienced a miscarriage, in which Moriyama then grieved the loss of a potential younger brother. He looked for a place for escape and solitude, in which he decided to build a treehouse outside of camp, as a lookout point. He made friends with Canadian farmers who supplied him with lumber and tools to build. He describes his experience of finding escape as such:<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.jsac.ca/jsac_web_pub/JSAC2015_comparative.pdf#page=143|title=Welcome to the Tree House!: The Architecture of Raymond Moriyama and His Life Comparison as an Interned Japanese Canadian with Artist William Allister as a POW in Japan|last=Creighton|first=Millie|date=2016|website=Japan and Canada in Comparative Perspective|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><blockquote>\"In despair, I decided to bathe in the Slocan River on the other side of a little mountain away from the camp. The water was glacial, but it was better than hot tears. To see who might be coming, I built an observation platform. Soon I found myself wanting to build my first architectural project, a tree house, without being found out by the RCMP. I used just an axe as a hammer, an old borrowed saw, six spikes, some nails, a rope, and mostly branches and scraps from the lumberyard.

During the eight months he spent bedridden after the accident, he saw an architect coming and going from a nearby construction site, \"with a blueprint under his arm and a pipe in his mouth.\" Moriyama decided then and there that he would become an architect too.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMoriyama's father was an outspoken pacifist who was arrested and made a Prisoner of War for his activism. Moriyama, at the age of twelve, was left to run the family hardware store along with his two sisters and pregnant mother. Shortly after, he and his family were forced out of Vancouver and confined to an [[Internment of Japanese Canadians|internment camp]] in the [[Slocan Valley]] of British Columbia during the Second World War.<ref name=\":0\" /> Japanese Canadians on the West Coast were classified as security threats, in a policy similar to that of the United States. He said these years were influential in his later career.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.magazine.utoronto.ca/all-about-alumni/raymond-moriyama-architect-canada-japanese-pow-camp/|work=U of T Magazine|accessdate=21 January 2012|title=The Architecture of a Life}}</ref>\n\nMoriyama has described his experiences in internment camps as miserable. During this time, his mother experienced a miscarriage, in which Moriyama then grieved the loss of a potential younger brother. He looked for a place for escape and solitude, in which he decided to build a treehouse outside of camp, as a lookout point. He made friends with Canadian farmers who supplied him with lumber and tools to build. He describes his experience of finding escape as such:<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.jsac.ca/jsac_web_pub/JSAC2015_comparative.pdf#page=143|title=Welcome to the Tree House!: The Architecture of Raymond Moriyama and His Life Comparison as an Interned Japanese Canadian with Artist William Allister as a POW in Japan|last=Creighton|first=Millie|date=2016|website=Japan and Canada in Comparative Perspective|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><blockquote>\"In despair, I decided to bathe in the Slocan River on the other side of a little mountain away from the camp. The water was glacial, but it was better than hot tears. To see who might be coming, I built an observation platform. Soon I found myself wanting to build my first architectural project, a tree house, without being found out by the RCMP. I used just an axe as a hammer, an old borrowed saw, six spikes, some nails, a rope, and mostly branches and scraps from the lumberyard. It was hard work building it by myself, and it was a lesson in economy of material and means.</blockquote><blockquote>That tree house, when finished, was beautiful.
