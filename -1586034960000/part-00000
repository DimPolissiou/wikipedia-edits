{"title_page": "Suburban Rhythm", "text_new": "{{More citations needed|date=June 2016}}\n'''Suburban Rhythm''' was a [[ska punk]] band from [[Long Beach, California]]. Formed in 1990, they played numerous shows in small-venue clubs with many now famous [[Orange County, California|O.C.]] bands opening their performances, including [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]], [[No Doubt]], and [[Reel Big Fish]]. Suburban Rhythm met with various roster changes and broke up in 1994.  Three years later in 1997 their only full-length album, ''[[Suburban Rhythm (album)|Suburban Rhythm]]'' was released.\n\n==History==\nIn August 1989, vocalist Dennis Owens, guitarist Jake Kline, keyboardist Rodi DelGadillo, bassist Deryke Cardenaz, and drummer Christine Tasche formed a band called The Silent Invasion, which played one show shortly before Tasche left the band. The remaining members decided to change the band's name to Suburban Rhythm; Ed Kampwirth replaced Cardenaz on bass while [[Carlos de la Garza (music producer)|Carlos de la Garza]], drummer for [[Cerritos, California|Cerritos]] ska band The Trenchtown Invaders, filled the band's drum slot.\n\n===Height of career===\nWith Kampwirth and de la Garza forming a solid rhythm section, the band played numerous shows in the [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] and [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] area. In October 1992, the band released their first (and only) demo, ''Hose''.\n\nIn April 1993, Kline quit the band to work on his own musical project, [[Eggbeater kick|Eggbeater]]. The band decided to find a new guitarist but vowed to break up if any more core members (including Kampwirth and De La Garza) decided to quit, fearing replacing any more members might \"water things down to the point of embarrassment\". After several try-outs, including [[Reel Big Fish]] founder [[Aaron Barrett]], the band chose [[Nuckle Brothers]] guitarist Scott Moran.\n\n===Breakup===\nIn late 1993 Suburban Rhythm started to record their first album. Friction among band members grew worse and in the middle of the sessions Kampwirth and Moran announced they were quitting. The band kept the promise they made after Kline left and played their last show on April 2, 1994 in Costa Mesa, CA. The band released the \"Almost There\" ep at the time of their breakup, containing 4 songs from the scrapped album.\n\n===Compilation===\nIn 1997, a posthumous [[Suburban Rhythm (album)|16-song compilation]] [[Compact disc|CD]] was released by Long Beach record label [[Solid Recordings]]. The album contains three tracks from the ''Hose'' demo cassette, all four tracks from the ''Almost There'' 7\" vinyl, nine previously unreleased tracks from the scrapped first album, five live tracks recorded at the [[Big Black Room]] in [[Santa Ana, California]] in 1993, as well as a hidden garage-recorded track entitled \"Uniform of Destruction\".\n\nThe CD also features liner notes written by [[No Doubt]] guitarist [[Tom Dumont]].\n\n==Musical style==\nWhile primarily labeled a [[ska]]/[[Punk rock|punk]] band, some of their recordings displayed styles from [[funk]] (e.g. \"18 Inch Ruler\"), to [[heavy metal music|metal]], [[jazz]], [[blues]], [[progressive rock|prog]], and even [[country music|country]] (e.g. \"Blue Hawaii\").\n\n==Influence and legacy==\nShortly after Suburban Rhythm's break-up, a large number of the band's contemporaries would go on to find success, and this would, in part, lead to a nationwide ska revival in the mid and late 1990s. Additionally, a large number of younger [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] ska bands had cited Suburban Rhythm as an influence, most notably, O.C. ska band [[Reel Big Fish]] has paid homage to Suburban Rhythm on many occasions. Their second full-length CD, ''[[Turn the Radio Off]]'', includes a tribute song to Suburban Rhythm entitled \"S.R\".  They also covered Suburban Rhythm's \"Uniform of Destruction\" for the [[Ska Parade]]'s compilation album, ''Runnin' Naked thru the Cornfield''. (Suburban Rhythm's \"Coming out of the Woodwork\" is featured on the same album.)  Reel Big Fish's front man, Aaron Barrett, paid further homage to Suburban Rhythm by covering one of their unreleased songs, Go to Hell, with his side band [[The Forces of Evil]], which was released on the album [[Friend or Foe?

Simons attended two South London public schools, [[Alleyn's School]] and [[Dulwich College]]. During his school years, he developed a fondness for [[rare groove]] and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] music, having frequented a club called the Mud Club from the age of 14. By the time he left school, his two main musical interests were two Manchester bands, [[New Order (band)|New Order]] and [[the Smiths]]. After finishing school with 11 [[General Certificate of Education|O]] levels and three A levels, he continued on to study history, especially late [[Middle Ages|medieval]] history, at the [[University of Manchester]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/celebrity/Ed+Simons-33297.html|title=Ed Simons' history lessons|last=June 2010|first=26|website=Femalefirst.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2019-05-09}}</ref>\n\nTom Rowlands, a childhood classmate of Simons, was born on 11 January 1971 in [[Kingston upon Thames]], London. When Rowlands was very young, his family relocated to [[Henley-on-Thames]]. He later attended [[Reading Blue Coat School]] in [[Berkshire]]. In his early teens, his interest in music broadened to other genres. Initially, some of his favourites included the ''[[Oh, What a Lovely War!|Oh What a Lovely War]]'' soundtrack, [[2 Tone (music genre)|2 Tone]], the nascent [[gothic rock]] genre ([[Sisters of Mercy]], [[Fields of the Nephilim]]) and the [[Electro (music)|electro]] sounds of artists such as [[Kraftwerk]], [[New Order (band)|New Order]], [[Cabaret Voltaire (band)|Cabaret Voltaire]], and [[Heaven 17]]. He described the first [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]] album, ''[[Yo! Bum Rush the Show]]'', as \"the record that probably changed his life\", and commented that \"Miuzi Weighs a Ton\" was \"one of the most amazing tracks he had ever heard\". Rowlands also started collecting [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] records by artists like [[Eric B]] and [[Schoolly D]]. Rowlands left school with similar accomplishments to Simons, achieving nine O levels and three A levels. For university, he followed Simons to Manchester primarily to immerse himself in its music scene in general and the [[Fac 51 Hacienda|Ha\u00e7ienda]] in particular.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.rhapsody.com/artist/the-chemical-brothers| title=Artist bio from Rhapsody|website=Rhapsody.com}}</ref>\n\nRowlands was also in a band called Ariel prior to meeting up with Simons.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> Ariel was formed in London by Rowlands and his friends Brendan Melck and Mathew Berry. Their first single was \"Sea of Beats\", which was essentially a [[white label]]. Before Philip Brown set up Echo Logik Records, their first promo was \"Bokadilo\". Other songs, released on [[Gramophone record|12-inch]], included \"Mustn't Grumble\" and their most well-known, \"Rollercoaster\".<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> After a year on Echo Logik they signed to the [[record label]] [[Deconstruction Records|deConstruction]]. They insisted that they get a female singer and they recruited former Xpansions frontwoman [[Sally Ann Marsh]], and after some disappointing songs like \"Let It Slide\" (Rowlands would later describe it as \"a stinker\") the band fell apart. One of the last things Ariel did was the song \"T Baby\" which was remixed by the pair. In regards to the remix, Ed stated that \"Ariel symbolically ended when Deconstruction asked us for a [[Dust Brothers]] remix of an Ariel track. That was the final nail in the coffin\". \n\nRowlands and Simons then started to [[Disc jockey|DJ]] at a club called \"Naked Under Leather\" in the back of a pub in 1992,<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> under the alias of \"The 237 Turbo Nutters\" (named after the number of their house on Dickenson Road in Manchester and a reference to their Blackburn [[Rave culture|raving]] days). The pair would play hip hop, [[Techno music|techno]], and [[House music|house]].<ref>''Brothers Gonna Work It Out'' (XDUSTCD 101) booklet, page 2.</ref> Rowlands and Simons called themselves the Dust Brothers  <ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> after [[Dust Brothers|the US production duo]] famous for their work with the [[Beastie Boys]]. After a while, they began to run out of suitable instrumental hip hop tracks to use, so they started to make their own. Using a [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]] hi-fi system, a computer, a sampler, and a keyboard, they recorded \"Song to the Siren\", which sampled [[This Mortal Coil]]. \"Song to the Siren\" was released on their own record label, called \"Diamond Records\" (after Ed's nickname). At this point The Dust Bros Were the first ever back room DJ's in the \u2018Sumptuous Locarno Lounge\u2019at \u2018The Job Club\u2018 in Gossips night club in Dean St Soho from April 1992 till April 1993. In October 1992, they pressed 500 white label copies and took them to various dance record shops around London, but none would play it, saying that it was too slow (the track played at 111 [[beats per minute|BPM]]). They sent a copy to London DJ [[Andrew Weatherall]], who made it a permanent fixture in his DJ sets. Weatherall also signed the band to his [[Junior Boy's Own]] label.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> In May 1993, Junior Boy's Own released \"Song to the Siren\".<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>\n\nAround June 1993, the Dust Brothers recorded their first remixes. The first was \"Packet of Peace\" for Justin Robertson's [[Lionrock]] group, followed by songs from [[Leftfield]], [[Republica]], and [[the Sandals]]. Later in 1993, the Dust Brothers completed work on their ''[[Fourteenth Century Sky]]'' [[Extended play|EP]], released in January 1994.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> It contained the ground-breaking \"Chemical Beats\", which epitomised the duo's genre-defining [[big beat]] sound.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> The EP also contained \"One Too Many Mornings\", which for the first time showed the less intense, more chilled-out side of the Dust Brothers. Both \"One Too Many Mornings\" and \"Chemical Beats\" would later appear on their debut album. ''Fourteenth Century Sky'' was followed later in 1994 by the ''[[My Mercury Mouth EP]]''.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> \"Chemical Beats\" was also part of the soundtrack for the first edition of the [[Wipeout (game)|Wipeout]] game series, having been featured in ''Wipeout'' for the [[PlayStation]] in 1995.\n\nIn October 1994, the Dust Brothers became resident DJs at the small, but influential [[Heavenly Recordings#The Social|Heavenly Sunday Social Club]] at the Albany pub in London's [[Great Portland Street]]. [[Noel Gallagher]], [[Paul Weller (singer)|Paul Weller]], [[James Dean Bradfield]], and [[Tim Burgess (artist)|Tim Burgess]] were regular visitors. The Dust Brothers were subsequently asked to remix tracks by [[Manic Street Preachers]] and [[The Charlatans (British band)|the Charlatans]], plus [[Primal Scream]]'s \"Jailbird\" and [[the Prodigy]]'s \"Voodoo People\". These two remixes received [[television]] exposure, being playlisted by [[MTV]] Europe's \"The Party Zone\" in 1995. Early in 1994, the Dust Brothers were approached in the club one Sunday by Noel Gallagher, from [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], who at the time were becoming one of the most prominent guitar bands in Britain. Gallagher told the duo that he had a [[Ibiza|Balearic]]-inspired track which he had written and would like the Dust Brothers to remix. However, over time, Gallagher changed his mind, and in the end the Brothers did not remix it.\n\nIn March 1995, the Dust Brothers began their first international tour, which included the United States \u2013 where they played with [[Orbital (band)|Orbital]] and [[Underworld (band)|Underworld]] \u2013 then a series of European festivals. Also around this time, objections were filed by [[Dust Brothers|the original Dust Brothers]] over the use of their name, and so Rowlands and Simons had to decide on a new name.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> They decided to call themselves \"The Chemical Brothers\" after \"Chemical Beats\" (Simons' grandmother had suggested they call themselves \"The Grit Brothers\").\n\nIn June 1995, they released their fourth single, the first under their new identity. \"Leave Home\" was released on Junior Boy's Own, as a preview of the imminent debut album and became the band's first chart hit, peaking at No. 17.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>\n\n=== 1995\u20131998: ''Exit Planet Dust'' and ''Dig Your Own Hole'' ===\nIn July 1995, the Chemical Brothers released their debut album ''[[Exit Planet Dust]]'' (the title inspired by their name change) on Freestyle Dust/Junior Boy's Own. It entered the UK charts at No. 9<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> and featured guest vocalist [[Beth Orton]] on the song \"Alive Alone\". It eventually went on to sell over a million copies worldwide, and was used on the soundtrack of the [[science fiction]] TV series pilot [[Virtuality (TV series)|Virtuality]]. Shortly after its release, the Chemical Brothers signed to [[Virgin Records]], to which they took their own offshoot label, Freestyle Dust. For their next single, \"[[Life Is Sweet (song)|Life Is Sweet]]\", released in September 1995, they again used a guest vocalist, featuring their friend Tim Burgess, singer of the Charlatans. It reached No. 25 in the UK Singles Chart.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> The single was also ''Select'' magazine's \"Single of the Month\" for October.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stpaulsgallery.com/prodtype.asp?strParents=&CAT_ID=399&numRecordPosition=1|title=The Chemical Brothers Soundwaves Art --- St. Pauls Gallery|website=Stpaulsgallery.com|access-date=2019-05-09}}</ref> The release included a [[Daft Punk]] remix of \"Life Is Sweet\".\n\n[[The Stone Roses]] asked the duo to remix \"Begging You\", from their ''[[Second Coming (The Stone Roses album)|Second Coming]]'' album. After beginning work on a remix which they viewed as having potential, they later rejected the idea and the work was cancelled.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nIn October 1995, the duo returned to the Heavenly Sunday Social for a second and final run of DJ dates. They then became residents at the Heavenly Social on Saturdays at Turnmills. In November, the Chemical Brothers played the [[Astoria Theatre]] in London. At this time the Brothers usually used a fusion of \"Chemical Beats\" and [[the Beatles]]' \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" as their encore. During the encore, however, [[Keith Flint]] from the Prodigy jumped up on stage to dance, wearing a T-shirt sporting the slogan \"Occupation: mad bastard\". A few from the crowd subsequently joined in. This resulted in a power cable being kicked loose, bringing the show to a temporary close. The Chemical Brothers confessed to not being too bothered; \"because he's Keith from The Prodigy, and he can do whatever the fucking hell he likes\". Just before Christmas 1995, they played their biggest gig to date, with the Prodigy, at the [[Brixton Academy]].\n\nIn January 1996, ''Exit Planet Dust'' was certified gold. The Chemical Brothers released their first new material in six months on Virgin, the ''Loops of Fury'' EP. The four-track release was limited to 20,000 copies, but is now available for digital download. It entered the UK charts at No. 13. ''[[NME]]'' described the lead track as \"splashing waves of synths across hard-hitting beats\". The EP also contained a Dave Clarke remix of \"Chemical Beats\", and two other new tracks, \"Get Up on It Like This\" and \"(The Best Part Of) Breaking Up\".\n\nIn February 1996, ''Select'' magazine published a list of the 100 best albums of the 1990s thus far. ''Exit Planet Dust'' was listed at Number 39. In August 1996, the Chemical Brothers supported Oasis at [[Concerts at Knebworth House|Knebworth]], where 125,000 people attended each of the two shows.\n\nDuring the 1995 [[Glastonbury Festival]], Rowlands and Simons had another conversation with [[Noel Gallagher]]. Gallagher told them how much he liked ''Exit Planet Dust'', and asked if he could sing on a future track, similar to the way [[Tim Burgess (artist)|Tim Burgess]] had worked on \"Life Is Sweet\". They did not think much of the offer at the time, given how busy Gallagher would be with the release of Oasis' ''[[(What's the Story) Morning Glory?]]'', plus the complexities of dealing with each other's record companies. However, the duo later worked on a track which they thought would benefit from having a vocal on it. They sent Gallagher a tape of what they had done so far. He worked on it overnight, and left a message with them early the next morning that he was ready to record it. The track was called \"[[Setting Sun (The Chemical Brothers song)|Setting Sun]]\" and was finally released in October 1996. It entered the UK charts at the top, giving the duo their first ever Number One single.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> \"Setting Sun\" was backed by a longer instrumental version, and also a new track \"Buzz Tracks\", which was not much more than a DJ tool. The three remaining members of the Beatles' lawyers later wrote to the Chemical Brothers, mistakenly claiming that they had sampled \"[[Tomorrow Never Knows]]\". Virgin Records hired a [[Musicology|musicologist]] to prove that they did not sample the song.\n\nMeanwhile, in 1996, ''[[Live at the Social Volume 1]]'' was released by [[Heavenly Records]], which became the Chemical Brothers' first mix CD (excluding ''Xmas Dust Up'', a free album that came in a 1994 issue of ''NME''). It was also the duo's first live album (excluding the EP ''[[Live 05]]'').\n\nIn March 1997, the Brothers released the second track from their forthcoming album. \"[[Block Rockin' Beats]]\" went straight to No. 1 in the UK, possibly thanks, this time, to its [[Schoolly D]] vocal sample and re-working of the bass-line from [[23 Skidoo (band)|23 Skidoo]]'s single \"Coup\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dsng.net/samplesources.htm |title=Sample Sources |work=dsng.net |date= |accessdate=24 September 2011}}</ref> The ''NME'' named it \"Single of the Week\" and said \"It throbs like your head might if you had just done a length underwater in a swimming pool full of [[Alkyl nitrites|amyl]].\" It later won them a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Best Rock Instrumental Performance]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=&title=&year=1997&genre=31 |title=Grammy Awards : Past Winners Search |website=Grammy.com|accessdate=2014-04-17}}</ref>\n\nIn the US at this time, \"Setting Sun\" was sitting at Number 80 in the Billboard Top 100, after selling around 80,000 copies, an uncommon achievement for a European \"dance\" act. Sales from ''Exit Planet Dust'' were also around 150,000.\n\nOn 7 April 1997, the Chemical Brothers released their second album, ''[[Dig Your Own Hole]]''. It was recorded at the band's own south London studio, with the title taken from graffiti on the wall outside. The album was well received,<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/103705/review/5945617/digyourownhole |title=Dig Your Own Hole: The Chemical Brothers: Review |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=3 April 1997 |accessdate=12 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116081718/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/103705/review/5945617/digyourownhole |archivedate=16 January 2009 }}</ref> with ''Mixmag'' rating it 10/10 and calling it \"mad enough to be thrilling, slick enough for not even remotely trendy coffee tables\".\n\nDuring the summer of 1997, the Brothers toured extensively, particularly in the United States. They also became residents at [[Tokyo]]'s Liquid Rooms. In August, the Chemical Brothers achieved a rapprochement with the US Dust Brothers, and asked them to remix the forthcoming single \"[[Elektrobank]]\". They themselves also became highly sought-after for remixes for other artists. In September, the next single from ''Dig Your Own Hole'', \"Elektrobank\" was released. In November, the pair played at [[Dublin]]'s Point Theatre, with support from [[Carl Cox]]. They also began a US tour in [[Detroit]].\n\nAt the end of the year, ''Dig Your Own Hole''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s final track, the nine-minute-long \"The Private Psychedelic Reel\", gave rise to a limited-edition mini-EP of the same name. The [[B-side]] consisted of a live version of \"Setting Sun\", recorded at the [[A Campingflight to Lowlands Paradise|Lowlands Festival]], Netherlands on 24 August 1997. Also in December, following four sold-out US shows, the Chemical Brothers toured the UK, concluding in a sold-out show at Brixton Academy, London\n\nIn 1998, they concentrated more on DJing, although some remixes did see the light of day, including \"I Think I'm in Love\" from [[Spiritualized]]. Both a vocal remix and an instrumental remix were included in the single release. Each clocked in at over seven-and-a-half minutes. Another remix completed by the Brothers was \"Delta Sun Bottleneck Stomp\" by [[Mercury Rev]]. This was another extension in the association between the two bands, since Mercury Rev's Jonathon Donahue contributed to \"The Private Psychedelic Reel\" on ''Dig Your Own Hole''.\n\nIn September 1998, a second mix album, ''[[Brothers Gonna Work It Out]]'', was released. It contains some of their own tracks and remixes, as well as songs from artists who have influenced their sound, such as [[Renegade Soundwave]], [[Meat Beat Manifesto]], Carlos \"After Dark\" Berrios, and [[Kenny 'Dope' Gonzales]].\n\n=== 1999\u20132002: ''Surrender'' and ''Come with Us'' ===\nIn May 1999, the Chemical Brothers played three UK dates in [[Manchester]], [[Sheffield]] and [[Brighton]], their first since December 1997. Also that month, they released their first new original material in two years, a track called \"Hey Boy, Hey Girl\". This was more [[house music|house]]-influenced than big beat. In interviews at the time, Rowlands and Simons indicated that the track was inspired by nights out at Sheffield club Gatecrasher. The track was also one of their more commercially accessible tracks and went to number 3 in the UK charts.\n\nTheir third album, ''[[Surrender (The Chemical Brothers album)|Surrender]]'', was released in June 1999. It featured vocals from Noel Gallagher, Mercury Rev's [[Jonathan Donahue]], and [[Mazzy Star]]'s [[Hope Sandoval]]. As \"Hey Boy, Hey Girl\" had suggested, the album was more house-oriented than the previous two. On one of the album's stand out tracks, \"Out of Control\", [[New Order (band)|New Order]]'s [[Bernard Sumner]] supported by [[Primal Scream]]'s [[Bobby Gillespie]] provided vocals. It reached No. 1 in the UK album charts. The [[Michel Gondry]]-directed [[music video]] for \"[[Let Forever Be]]\", which utilised ground-breaking video and film effects in its depiction of a young woman's nightmares, also received a lot of attention.\n\nLater that summer, the Brothers performed at the infamous [[Woodstock 99]] concert on 24 July, with positive reception. They later headlined the [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury]] dance tent on the Friday night, followed by a UK tour which ended in December and included [[Homelands (festival)|Homelands]] Scotland on 4 September. In November, \"Out of Control\", featuring Sumner and Gillespie on vocals, was released as a single. The release also contained the [[Sasha (DJ)|Sasha]] remix. The final single from ''Surrender'', in February 2000, was the five track \"Music: Response\" EP, containing the title track and two remixes, plus [[Electronic Battle Weapon]] 4, named \"Freak of the Week\", and a track called \"Enjoyed\", which was essentially a remix of \"Out of Control\" by the Brothers themselves.\nA CD copy of ''Surrender'' was placed in the third ''[[Blue Peter]]'' [[time capsule]], buried in January 2000. That same month, they appeared on Primal Scream's album ''[[Xtrmntr]]'' at track 11 with a remix.\n\nIn June 2000, Tom and Ed played the Pyramid stage at the Glastonbury Festival. In August 2000 they played to a large crowd at the main stage at Creamfields festival, [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. In December 2000, the Chemical Brothers aired one of their new tracks, \"It Began in Afrika\" at their New York DJ gigs, supporting [[U2]].\n\nIn 2001, they were quite active with releases and live performances. Early in the year, they began working on a fourth album, provisionally titled ''Chemical Four''. The first track which fans got a taste of was \"It Began in Afrika\", as previously played in their DJ set in New York. The track would make its live debut in [[California]] in April 2001, at the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]]. Another new track, \"Galaxy Bounce\", also got its public debut at Coachella. As had become customary for their releases and experiments, \"It Began in Afrika\" was first pressed as a promo, as part of the \"[[Electronic Battle Weapon]]\" series. It received much airplay on dance music radio shows in the UK, and became more and more popular in clubs over the course of the summer. It also became one of the \"anthems\" in [[Ibiza]] as the summer progressed. It was given a full commercial single release in September, reaching No. 8 in the UK singles chart, even though no promotional video was made for the track.\n\nRowlands and Simons also remixed a track from [[Fatboy Slim]]'s ''[[Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars]]'', entitled \"Song for Shelter\". This remix was released as a single on 3 September 2001 (one week before \"It Began in Afrika\") as the CD2 single for \"[[Song for Shelter / Ya Mama]]\". It reached No. 30 in the UK Singles Charts (sales were combined with the CD1 single).\n\nThe Chemical Brothers finished work on another album, ''[[Come with Us]]'', in October 2001. It featured collaborations with [[Richard Ashcroft]] of [[the Verve]] (\"The Test\"), and long-time collaborator [[Beth Orton]] (\"The State We're In\"). The album was released in January 2002, preceded by a single, \"Star Guitar\", a melodic [[Balearic beat]] number, with a promotional video by [[Michel Gondry]] that featured passing scenery synchronised to the beat viewed through a train window. What would be the second track on the album, \"It Began in Afrika\", was released 10 September 2001 to be circulated around the clubbing scene where it was a popular hit. \"Star Guitar\" was also released as a [[DVD]] single, the pair's first. ''Come with Us'', was less well received than their previous albums, but nonetheless went straight to No. 1 in the UK Albums Chart in the first week of its release, selling 100,000 copies. In April, the title track from the album was released as a single with remixes by [[Fatboy Slim]] as part of a double A-sided release with \"The Test\".\n\nDuring the summer of 2002, the Chemical Brothers travelled the festival circuit to promote the album. Later in 2002, they released two EPs, one specifically aimed at Japan and the other the US (entitled ''[[AmericanEP]]''). Both contained remixes, live versions and B-sides. Additionally, the band produced [[New Order (band)|New Order]]'s final non-album single \"[[Here to Stay (New Order song)|Here to Stay]]\", and remixed the song as well.\nOne of their other major songs from this album was \"Galaxy Bounce\", which was popular and featured as the main title music for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] game ''[[Project Gotham Racing (video game)|Project Gotham Racing]]''. It was also included on the soundtrack for the movie ''[[Lara Croft: Tomb Raider]]''. \"Star Guitar\" was featured as a song on the [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]]'s ''[[Lumines II]]''.\n\nTwo other songs, \"Come with Us (Introduction)\" and \"Star Guitar (Title Screen)\", were featured on a ''[[PlayStation 2]]'' racing game titled ''WRC II: Extreme''. Both songs are instrumental.\nThe song \"My Elastic Eye\" from the ''Come with Us'' album was played in the 2004 movie ''[[The Butterfly Effect]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0289879/soundtrack |title=The Butterfly Effect (2004) \u2013 Soundtracks |work=Imdb.com |accessdate=24 September 2011}}</ref> starring [[Ashton Kutcher]] and [[Amy Smart]].\n\n=== 2003\u20132006: ''Push the Button'' ===\nEarly 2003 saw Rowlands and Simons back in the studio working on new material, including \"The Golden Path\", a collaboration with [[Wayne Coyne]] of [[the Flaming Lips]]. This was released in September 2003, at the same time as a \"best of\" album, entitled ''[[Singles 93\u201303]]'', marking ten years of the Chemical Brothers' releases. ''Singles 93\u201303'' included most, but not all, of their singles. A second new track, in addition to \"The Golden Path\", was included on the album, called \"Get Yourself High\". ''Singles 93\u201303'' was also released on DVD, with extra features including selected live performances and interviews with Rowlands, Simons, and many of their collaborators from throughout the period. \"Get Yourself High\", which featured Canadian rapper [[k-os]] on vocals, was released as a single in November 2003.\n\nIn late 2003 and 2004, the Chemical Brothers continued to work in the studio on new material and a remix of \"[[Slow (Kylie Minogue song)|Slow]]\" by [[Kylie Minogue]]. After being released on rare white label vinyl, it was subsequently given a commercial release in March on CD (on her next single \"Red Blooded Woman\") and on exclusive 12-inch vinyl picture disc (containing two other Kylie remixes). In Summer 2004 they returned to the festival circuit, including appearances at the [[Glastonbury Festival]], Tokyo, Scotland, and Ireland. They also visited [[South America]] for the second time (the first time being in 1999), arriving at [[Chile]], [[Argentina]], and [[Brazil]]. It was during these sets that they played new material, including \"Acid Children\", which proved to be one of the most popular new tracks.\n\nIn September 2004, the Chemical Brothers released the seventh \"Electronic Battle Weapon\". \"Electronic Battle Weapon 7\" was being released as a one-sided promo-only 12-inch, containing \"Acid Children\". A marked departure from the Chemical Brothers' previous musical endeavours, it featured a screeching 303 bassline and a distinctive vocal sample; a pitch-altered vocal sample proclaiming \"You Are All My Children Now!\", which is lifted from the horror film ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge]]''. It was coupled with the projection of a sinister clown mouthing these same words at their live gigs.\n\nThe Electronic Battle Weapon series of promo releases have typically been newly recorded Chemical Brothers tracks, released on promo to allow DJs to test them in a club environment, and to gauge their popularity.\n\nIn 2004, the Chemical Brothers began work on ''[[Push the Button (The Chemical Brothers album)|Push the Button]]'', their fifth studio album, which features collaborations with [[Tim Burgess (artist)|Tim Burgess]], [[Kele Okereke]], and [[Anwar Superstar]], amongst others. The album was released on 24 January 2005.\n\n\"[[Galvanize (song)|Galvanize]]\", which features rapper [[Q-Tip (rapper)|Q-Tip]] on vocals, was the first single to be taken from ''Push the Button'', and premiered exclusively on [[iTunes]]. The single was released on 17 January 2005, and entered the UK chart at No. 3. The second single, \"[[Believe (Chemical Brothers song)|Believe]]\" (featuring Kele Okereke from [[Bloc Party]]), failed to crack the top 10, but still made it into the top 20, peaking at No. 18. \"The Boxer\", featuring Tim Burgess, became the duo's first single to fail to crack the top 40.\n\nThe album and single \"Galvanize\" won a Grammy at the [[Grammy Awards of 2006]]. One of the songs in this album, \"The Big Jump\", appears in the video game ''[[Burnout Revenge]]'', as well as ''[[Project Gotham Racing 3]]''. The track \"Surface to Air\" features a pulsing chord progression and bassline reminiscent of the intro to the [[The Strokes|Strokes]] song \"The Modern Age\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Chemical action, crowd reaction - Music - www.theage.com.au|url=https://www.theage.com.au/news/Music/Chemical-action-crowd-reaction/2005/01/27/1106415717077.html|website=Theage.com.au|accessdate=13 March 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAn unofficial, remixed version of the album entitled ''Flip the Switch'' was released as a free download, along with the ''Believe'' EP, featuring six further remixes of \"Believe\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chems.musicremixed.org/main.html |title=Flip The Switch \u2013 The Chemical Brothers remixed |accessdate=13 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126182108/http://chems.musicremixed.org/main.html |archivedate=26 January 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn September 2006, the Chemical Brothers were revealed as the first musicians to be involved in Tate Tracks.<ref name=\"Moss\">{{cite web|url=http://www.culture24.org.uk/art/art39863|title=Tate Modern Makes Music With Chemical Brothers For Tate Tracks Project|last=Moss|first=Richard|date=31 August 2006|work=[[Culture24]]|accessdate=9 May 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"TateTracks\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tatetracks.org.uk|title=Tate Tracks|year=2006|publisher=[[Tate]]|accessdate=9 May 2013}}</ref> [[Tate Modern]] invited various groups and songwriters to choose a work that inspired them from the gallery's collection of modern art and then write a track about it.

The double-sided vinyl was finally released just before the Chemical Brothers' much anticipated New Year's Eve gig at the famous [[Turnmills]] in London. The vinyl had a limited edition release worldwide and was received well by fans, DJs, and critics alike. Electronic Battle Weapon 8, at about six and a half minutes, was very distinct from the \"big acid\" style that the earlier Battle Weapons adhered to. It was characterised by 'thundering' drums with a rising synth line. A version of this track featured on the ''We Are the Night'' album and was entitled \"Saturate\". \"Electronic Battle Weapon 9\" was a typical Chemicals dancefloor track with their trademark [[vocoder]] vocals coupled with sirens and a basic 'tribal' melody.\n\nAt the same [[Turnmills]] gig, the Brothers also played a previously unreleased song at midnight to welcome 2007, which went down well with the crowd. This track eventually emerged as \"Burst Generator\", found on the forthcoming album ''We Are the Night''. Many were left wondering if the latest in the Electronic Battle Weapon series were simply one-off experiments or signalled a new direction they could take with the new album, perhaps swaying from their genre defining big beat albums of the past. The song was also the band's 100th released song.\n\nOn 21 March 2007, the Chemical Brothers officially announced their forthcoming album on [[MySpace]]. The new album, entitled ''[[We Are the Night (album)|We Are the Night]]'', was released on 2 July 2007 in the United Kingdom and 17 July 2007 in the United States.

The official release of the single was 4 June (digital download) and 14 June (12-inch, 7-inch and CD). The album went on general release in the UK on 2 July 2007.\n\nIn September 2007, the Chemical Brothers played a free live gig in Trafalgar Square as part of the Becks Fusions event. All who attended were provided with 3D glasses to view the on-screen visual effects.\n\nThe Chemical Brothers supplied a new track for the ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]'' soundtrack, titled \"Keep My Composure\". An alternate version of this track was released on ''[[Brotherhood (The Chemical Brothers album)|Brotherhood]]'', the duo's second singles compilation, which also featured the new single \"[[Midnight Madness (song)|Midnight Madness]]\" and a second disc of every Electronic Battle Weapon released to date. The Chemical Brothers continued to tour into 2008 to promote the collection, including a landmark date at [[Olympia London]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hasted |first1=Nick |title=The Chemical Brothers, Olympia, London |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/the-chemical-brothers-olympia-london-915695.html |website=The Independent |accessdate=2019-11-21}}</ref>\n\n=== 2010-2012: ''Further'', ''Hanna'' and ''Don't Think'' ===\nOn 30 March 2010, the band announced on their website that their seventh studio album, titled ''[[Further (The Chemical Brothers album)|Further]]'', would be released on 22 June and would be \"the band's first to be released with corresponding films made specifically to match each of the 8 audio tracks.\" The films were made with long-time visuals collaborators  [[Adam Smith (director)|Adam Smith]] and Marcus Lyall.

[[the Prodigy]], [[Fatboy Slim]], and other fellow acts, they were pioneers at bringing the [[big beat]] genre to the forefront of pop culture. They achieved widespread success when their second album ''[[Dig Your Own Hole]]'' topped the UK charts in 1997. In the [[United Kingdom]] they have had six number one albums and thirteen Top Twenty singles, including two number ones. In the United States they have won six [[Grammy Award|Grammy Awards]] including \"Best Rock Instrumental Performance\", \"Best Dance Recording\" and \"Best Dance/Electronic Album\" of the year as recently as 2020.<ref>[https://www.vulture.com/2020/01/grammy-winners-2020-the-full-list.html Grammy Winners List 2020] by Zoe Haylock, Vulture.com, January 27, 2020.</ref>\n\n==History==\n=== 1984\u20131995: Formation and early career ===\nEd Simons was born in [[Herne Hill]], [[South London]], on 9 June 1970 to a barrister mother and an absent father.{{Weasel inline|date=August 2018}} Simons' two main interests when he was young were [[aeroplanes]] and musicals. Simons attended two South London public schools, [[Alleyn's School]] and [[Dulwich College]]. During his school years, he developed a fondness for [[rare groove]] and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] music, having frequented a club called the Mud Club from the age of 14. By the time he left school, his two main musical interests were two Manchester bands, [[New Order (band)|New Order]] and [[the Smiths]]. After finishing school with 11 [[General Certificate of Education|O]] levels and three A levels, he continued on to study history, especially late [[Middle Ages|medieval]] history, at the [[University of Manchester]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/celebrity/Ed+Simons-33297.html|title=Ed Simons' history lessons|last=June 2010|first=26|website=Femalefirst.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2019-05-09}}</ref>\n\nTom Rowlands, a childhood classmate of Simons, was born on 11 January 1971 in [[Kingston upon Thames]], London. When Rowlands was very young, his family relocated to [[Henley-on-Thames]]. He later attended [[Reading Blue Coat School]] in [[Berkshire]]. In his early teens, his interest in music broadened to other genres. Initially, some of his favourites included the ''[[Oh, What a Lovely War!|Oh What a Lovely War]]'' soundtrack, [[2 Tone (music genre)|2 Tone]], the nascent [[gothic rock]] genre ([[Sisters of Mercy]], [[Fields of the Nephilim]]) and the [[Electro (music)|electro]] sounds of artists such as [[Kraftwerk]], [[New Order (band)|New Order]], [[Cabaret Voltaire (band)|Cabaret Voltaire]], and [[Heaven 17]]. He described the first [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]] album, ''[[Yo! Bum Rush the Show]]'', as \"the record that probably changed his life\", and commented that \"Miuzi Weighs a Ton\" was \"one of the most amazing tracks he had ever heard\". Rowlands also started collecting [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] records by artists like [[Eric B]] and [[Schoolly D]]. Rowlands left school with similar accomplishments to Simons, achieving nine O levels and three A levels. For university, he followed Simons to Manchester primarily to immerse himself in its music scene in general and the [[Fac 51 Hacienda|Ha\u00e7ienda]] in particular.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.rhapsody.com/artist/the-chemical-brothers| title=Artist bio from Rhapsody|website=Rhapsody.com}}</ref>\n\nRowlands was also in a band called Ariel prior to meeting up with Simons.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> Ariel was formed in London by Rowlands and his friends Brendan Melck and Mathew Berry. Their first single was \"Sea of Beats\", which was essentially a [[white label]]. Before Philip Brown set up Echo Logik Records, their first promo was \"Bokadilo\". Other songs, released on [[Gramophone record|12-inch]], included \"Mustn't Grumble\" and their most well-known, \"Rollercoaster\".<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> After a year on Echo Logik they signed to the [[record label]] [[Deconstruction Records|deConstruction]]. They insisted that they get a female singer and they recruited former Xpansions frontwoman [[Sally Ann Marsh]], and after some disappointing songs like \"Let It Slide\" (Rowlands would later describe it as \"a stinker\") the band fell apart. One of the last things Ariel did was the song \"T Baby\" which was remixed by the pair. In regards to the remix, Ed stated that \"Ariel symbolically ended when Deconstruction asked us for a [[Dust Brothers]] remix of an Ariel track. That was the final nail in the coffin\". \n\nRowlands and Simons then started to [[Disc jockey|DJ]] at a club called \"Naked Under Leather\" in the back of a pub in 1992,<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> under the alias of \"The 237 Turbo Nutters\" (named after the number of their house on Dickenson Road in Manchester and a reference to their Blackburn [[Rave culture|raving]] days). The pair would play hip hop, [[Techno music|techno]], and [[House music|house]].<ref>''Brothers Gonna Work It Out'' (XDUSTCD 101) booklet, page 2.</ref> Rowlands and Simons called themselves the Dust Brothers  <ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> after [[Dust Brothers|the US production duo]] famous for their work with the [[Beastie Boys]]. After a while, they began to run out of suitable instrumental hip hop tracks to use, so they started to make their own. Using a [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]] hi-fi system, a computer, a sampler, and a keyboard, they recorded \"Song to the Siren\", which sampled [[This Mortal Coil]]. \"Song to the Siren\" was released on their own record label, called \"Diamond Records\" (after Ed's nickname). At this point The Dust Bros Were the first ever back room DJ's in the \u2018Sumptuous Locarno Lounge\u2019at \u2018The Job Club\u2018 in Gossips night club in Dean St Soho from April 1992 till April 1993. In October 1992, they pressed 500 white label copies and took them to various dance record shops around London, but none would play it, saying that it was too slow (the track played at 111 [[beats per minute|BPM]]). They sent a copy to London DJ [[Andrew Weatherall]], who made it a permanent fixture in his DJ sets. Weatherall also signed the band to his [[Junior Boy's Own]] label.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> In May 1993, Junior Boy's Own released \"Song to the Siren\".<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>\n\nAround June 1993, the Dust Brothers recorded their first remixes. The first was \"Packet of Peace\" for Justin Robertson's [[Lionrock]] group, followed by songs from [[Leftfield]], [[Republica]], and [[the Sandals]]. Later in 1993, the Dust Brothers completed work on their ''[[Fourteenth Century Sky]]'' [[Extended play|EP]], released in January 1994.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> It contained the ground-breaking \"Chemical Beats\", which epitomised the duo's genre-defining [[big beat]] sound.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> The EP also contained \"One Too Many Mornings\", which for the first time showed the less intense, more chilled-out side of the Dust Brothers. Both \"One Too Many Mornings\" and \"Chemical Beats\" would later appear on their debut album. ''Fourteenth Century Sky'' was followed later in 1994 by the ''[[My Mercury Mouth EP]]''.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> \"Chemical Beats\" was also part of the soundtrack for the first edition of the [[Wipeout (game)|Wipeout]] game series, having been featured in ''Wipeout'' for the [[PlayStation]] in 1995.\n\nIn October 1994, the Dust Brothers became resident DJs at the small, but influential [[Heavenly Recordings#The Social|Heavenly Sunday Social Club]] at the Albany pub in London's [[Great Portland Street]]. [[Noel Gallagher]], [[Paul Weller (singer)|Paul Weller]], [[James Dean Bradfield]], and [[Tim Burgess (artist)|Tim Burgess]] were regular visitors. The Dust Brothers were subsequently asked to remix tracks by [[Manic Street Preachers]] and [[The Charlatans (British band)|the Charlatans]], plus [[Primal Scream]]'s \"Jailbird\" and [[the Prodigy]]'s \"Voodoo People\". These two remixes received [[television]] exposure, being playlisted by [[MTV]] Europe's \"The Party Zone\" in 1995. Early in 1994, the Dust Brothers were approached in the club one Sunday by Noel Gallagher, from [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], who at the time were becoming one of the most prominent guitar bands in Britain. Gallagher told the duo that he had a [[Ibiza|Balearic]]-inspired track which he had written and would like the Dust Brothers to remix. However, over time, Gallagher changed his mind, and in the end the Brothers did not remix it.\n\nIn March 1995, the Dust Brothers began their first international tour, which included the United States \u2013 where they played with [[Orbital (band)|Orbital]] and [[Underworld (band)|Underworld]] \u2013 then a series of European festivals. Also around this time, objections were filed by [[Dust Brothers|the original Dust Brothers]] over the use of their name, and so Rowlands and Simons had to decide on a new name.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> They decided to call themselves \"The Chemical Brothers\" after \"Chemical Beats\" (Simons' grandmother had suggested they call themselves \"The Grit Brothers\").\n\nIn June 1995, they released their fourth single, the first under their new identity. \"Leave Home\" was released on Junior Boy's Own, as a preview of the imminent debut album and became the band's first chart hit, peaking at No. 17.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>\n\n=== 1995\u20131998: ''Exit Planet Dust'' and ''Dig Your Own Hole'' ===\nIn July 1995, the Chemical Brothers released their debut album ''[[Exit Planet Dust]]'' (the title inspired by their name change) on Freestyle Dust/Junior Boy's Own. It entered the UK charts at No. 9<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> and featured guest vocalist [[Beth Orton]] on the song \"Alive Alone\". It eventually went on to sell over a million copies worldwide, and was used on the soundtrack of the [[science fiction]] TV series pilot [[Virtuality (TV series)|Virtuality]]. Shortly after its release, the Chemical Brothers signed to [[Virgin Records]], to which they took their own offshoot label, Freestyle Dust. For their next single, \"[[Life Is Sweet (song)|Life Is Sweet]]\", released in September 1995, they again used a guest vocalist, featuring their friend Tim Burgess, singer of the Charlatans. It reached No. 25 in the UK Singles Chart.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> The single was also ''Select'' magazine's \"Single of the Month\" for October.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stpaulsgallery.com/prodtype.asp?strParents=&CAT_ID=399&numRecordPosition=1|title=The Chemical Brothers Soundwaves Art --- St. Pauls Gallery|website=Stpaulsgallery.com|access-date=2019-05-09}}</ref> The release included a [[Daft Punk]] remix of \"Life Is Sweet\".\n\n[[The Stone Roses]] asked the duo to remix \"Begging You\", from their ''[[Second Coming (The Stone Roses album)|Second Coming]]'' album. After beginning work on a remix which they viewed as having potential, they later rejected the idea and the work was cancelled.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nIn October 1995, the duo returned to the Heavenly Sunday Social for a second and final run of DJ dates. They then became residents at the Heavenly Social on Saturdays at Turnmills. In November, the Chemical Brothers played the [[Astoria Theatre]] in London. At this time the Brothers usually used a fusion of \"Chemical Beats\" and [[the Beatles]]' \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" as their encore. During the encore, however, [[Keith Flint]] from the Prodigy jumped up on stage to dance, wearing a T-shirt sporting the slogan \"Occupation: mad bastard\". A few from the crowd subsequently joined in. This resulted in a power cable being kicked loose, bringing the show to a temporary close. The Chemical Brothers confessed to not being too bothered; \"because he's Keith from The Prodigy, and he can do whatever the fucking hell he likes\". Just before Christmas 1995, they played their biggest gig to date, with the Prodigy, at the [[Brixton Academy]].\n\nIn January 1996, ''Exit Planet Dust'' was certified gold. The Chemical Brothers released their first new material in six months on Virgin, the ''Loops of Fury'' EP. The four-track release was limited to 20,000 copies, but is now available for digital download. It entered the UK charts at No. 13. ''[[NME]]'' described the lead track as \"splashing waves of synths across hard-hitting beats\". The EP also contained a Dave Clarke remix of \"Chemical Beats\", and two other new tracks, \"Get Up on It Like This\" and \"(The Best Part Of) Breaking Up\".\n\nIn February 1996, ''Select'' magazine published a list of the 100 best albums of the 1990s thus far. ''Exit Planet Dust'' was listed at Number 39. In August 1996, the Chemical Brothers supported Oasis at [[Concerts at Knebworth House|Knebworth]], where 125,000 people attended each of the two shows.\n\nDuring the 1995 [[Glastonbury Festival]], Rowlands and Simons had another conversation with [[Noel Gallagher]]. Gallagher told them how much he liked ''Exit Planet Dust'', and asked if he could sing on a future track, similar to the way [[Tim Burgess (artist)|Tim Burgess]] had worked on \"Life Is Sweet\". They did not think much of the offer at the time, given how busy Gallagher would be with the release of Oasis' ''[[(What's the Story) Morning Glory?]]'', plus the complexities of dealing with each other's record companies. However, the duo later worked on a track which they thought would benefit from having a vocal on it. They sent Gallagher a tape of what they had done so far. He worked on it overnight, and left a message with them early the next morning that he was ready to record it. The track was called \"[[Setting Sun (The Chemical Brothers song)|Setting Sun]]\" and was finally released in October 1996. It entered the UK charts at the top, giving the duo their first ever Number One single.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> \"Setting Sun\" was backed by a longer instrumental version, and also a new track \"Buzz Tracks\", which was not much more than a DJ tool. The three remaining members of the Beatles' lawyers later wrote to the Chemical Brothers, mistakenly claiming that they had sampled \"[[Tomorrow Never Knows]]\". Virgin Records hired a [[Musicology|musicologist]] to prove that they did not sample the song.\n\nMeanwhile, in 1996, ''[[Live at the Social Volume 1]]'' was released by [[Heavenly Records]], which became the Chemical Brothers' first mix CD (excluding ''Xmas Dust Up'', a free album that came in a 1994 issue of ''NME''). It was also the duo's first live album (excluding the EP ''[[Live 05]]'').\n\nIn March 1997, the Brothers released the second track from their forthcoming album. \"[[Block Rockin' Beats]]\" went straight to No. 1 in the UK, possibly thanks, this time, to its [[Schoolly D]] vocal sample and re-working of the bass-line from [[23 Skidoo (band)|23 Skidoo]]'s single \"Coup\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dsng.net/samplesources.htm |title=Sample Sources |work=dsng.net |date= |accessdate=24 September 2011}}</ref> The ''NME'' named it \"Single of the Week\" and said \"It throbs like your head might if you had just done a length underwater in a swimming pool full of [[Alkyl nitrites|amyl]].\" It later won them a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Best Rock Instrumental Performance]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=&title=&year=1997&genre=31 |title=Grammy Awards : Past Winners Search |website=Grammy.com|accessdate=2014-04-17}}</ref>\n\nIn the US at this time, \"Setting Sun\" was sitting at Number 80 in the Billboard Top 100, after selling around 80,000 copies, an uncommon achievement for a European \"dance\" act. Sales from ''Exit Planet Dust'' were also around 150,000.\n\nOn 7 April 1997, the Chemical Brothers released their second album, ''[[Dig Your Own Hole]]''. It was recorded at the band's own south London studio, with the title taken from graffiti on the wall outside. The album was well received,<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/103705/review/5945617/digyourownhole |title=Dig Your Own Hole: The Chemical Brothers: Review |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=3 April 1997 |accessdate=12 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116081718/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/103705/review/5945617/digyourownhole |archivedate=16 January 2009 }}</ref> with ''Mixmag'' rating it 10/10 and calling it \"mad enough to be thrilling, slick enough for not even remotely trendy coffee tables\".\n\nDuring the summer of 1997, the Brothers toured extensively, particularly in the United States. They also became residents at [[Tokyo]]'s Liquid Rooms. In August, the Chemical Brothers achieved a rapprochement with the US Dust Brothers, and asked them to remix the forthcoming single \"[[Elektrobank]]\". They themselves also became highly sought-after for remixes for other artists. In September, the next single from ''Dig Your Own Hole'', \"Elektrobank\" was released. In November, the pair played at [[Dublin]]'s Point Theatre, with support from [[Carl Cox]]. They also began a US tour in [[Detroit]].\n\nAt the end of the year, ''Dig Your Own Hole''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s final track, the nine-minute-long \"The Private Psychedelic Reel\", gave rise to a limited-edition mini-EP of the same name. The [[B-side]] consisted of a live version of \"Setting Sun\", recorded at the [[A Campingflight to Lowlands Paradise|Lowlands Festival]], Netherlands on 24 August 1997. Also in December, following four sold-out US shows, the Chemical Brothers toured the UK, concluding in a sold-out show at Brixton Academy, London\n\nIn 1998, they concentrated more on DJ'ing, although some remixes did see the light of day, including \"I Think I'm in Love\" from [[Spiritualized]]. Both a vocal remix and an instrumental remix were included in the single release. Each clocked in at over seven-and-a-half minutes. Another remix completed by the Brothers was \"Delta Sun Bottleneck Stomp\" by [[Mercury Rev]]. This was another extension in the association between the two bands, since Mercury Rev's Jonathon Donahue contributed to \"The Private Psychedelic Reel\" on ''Dig Your Own Hole''.\n\nIn September 1998, a second mix album, ''[[Brothers Gonna Work It Out]]'', was released. It contains some of their own tracks and remixes, as well as songs from artists who have influenced their sound, such as [[Renegade Soundwave]], [[Meat Beat Manifesto]], Carlos \"After Dark\" Berrios, and [[Kenny 'Dope' Gonzales]].\n\n=== 1999\u20132002: ''Surrender'' and ''Come with Us'' ===\nIn May 1999, the Chemical Brothers played three UK dates in [[Manchester]], [[Sheffield]] and [[Brighton]], their first since December 1997. Also that month, they released their first new original material in two years, a track called \"Hey Boy, Hey Girl\". This was more [[house music|house]]-influenced than big beat. In interviews at the time, Rowlands and Simons indicated that the track was inspired by nights out at Sheffield club Gatecrasher. The track was also one of their more commercially accessible tracks and went to number 3 in the UK charts.\n\nTheir third album, ''[[Surrender (The Chemical Brothers album)|Surrender]]'', was released in June 1999. It featured vocals from Noel Gallagher, Mercury Rev's [[Jonathan Donahue]], and [[Mazzy Star]]'s [[Hope Sandoval]]. As \"Hey Boy, Hey Girl\" had suggested, the album was more house-oriented than the previous two. On one of the album's stand out tracks, \"Out of Control\", [[New Order (band)|New Order]]'s [[Bernard Sumner]] supported by [[Primal Scream]]'s [[Bobby Gillespie]] provided vocals. It reached No. 1 in the UK album charts. The [[Michel Gondry]]-directed [[music video]] for \"[[Let Forever Be]]\", which utilised ground-breaking video and film effects in its depiction of a young woman's nightmares, also received a lot of attention.\n\nLater that summer, the Brothers performed at the infamous [[Woodstock 99]] concert on 24 July, with positive reception. They later headlined the [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury]] dance tent on the Friday night, followed by a UK tour which ended in December and included [[Homelands (festival)|Homelands]] Scotland on 4 September. In November, \"Out of Control\", featuring Sumner and Gillespie on vocals, was released as a single. The release also contained the [[Sasha (DJ)|Sasha]] remix. The final single from ''Surrender'', in February 2000, was the five track \"Music: Response\" EP, containing the title track and two remixes, plus [[Electronic Battle Weapon]] 4, named \"Freak of the Week\", and a track called \"Enjoyed\", which was essentially a remix of \"Out of Control\" by the Brothers themselves.\nA CD copy of ''Surrender'' was placed in the third ''[[Blue Peter]]'' [[time capsule]], buried in January 2000. That same month, they appeared on Primal Scream's album ''[[Xtrmntr]]'' at track 11 with a remix.\n\nIn June 2000, Tom and Ed played the Pyramid stage at the Glastonbury Festival. In August 2000 they played to a large crowd at the main stage at Creamfields festival, [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. In December 2000, the Chemical Brothers aired one of their new tracks, \"It Began in Afrika\" at their New York DJ gigs, supporting [[U2]].\n\nIn 2001, they were quite active with releases and live performances. Early in the year, they began working on a fourth album, provisionally titled ''Chemical Four''. The first track which fans got a taste of was \"It Began in Afrika\", as previously played in their DJ set in New York. The track would make its live debut in [[California]] in April 2001, at the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]]. Another new track, \"Galaxy Bounce\", also got its public debut at Coachella. As had become customary for their releases and experiments, \"It Began in Afrika\" was first pressed as a promo, as part of the \"[[Electronic Battle Weapon]]\" series. It received much airplay on dance music radio shows in the UK, and became more and more popular in clubs over the course of the summer. It also became one of the \"anthems\" in [[Ibiza]] as the summer progressed. It was given a full commercial single release in September, reaching No. 8 in the UK singles chart, even though no promotional video was made for the track.\n\nRowlands and Simons also remixed a track from [[Fatboy Slim]]'s ''[[Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars]]'', entitled \"Song for Shelter\". This remix was released as a single on 3 September 2001 (one week before \"It Began in Afrika\") as the CD2 single for \"[[Song for Shelter / Ya Mama]]\". It reached No. 30 in the UK Singles Charts (sales were combined with the CD1 single).\n\nThe Chemical Brothers finished work on another album, ''[[Come with Us]]'', in October 2001. It featured collaborations with [[Richard Ashcroft]] of [[the Verve]] (\"The Test\"), and long-time collaborator [[Beth Orton]] (\"The State We're In\"). The album was released in January 2002, preceded by a single, \"Star Guitar\", a melodic [[Balearic beat]] number, with a promotional video by [[Michel Gondry]] that featured passing scenery synchronised to the beat viewed through a train window. What would be the second track on the album, \"It Began in Afrika\", was released 10 September 2001 to be circulated around the clubbing scene where it was a popular hit. \"Star Guitar\" was also released as a [[DVD]] single, the pair's first. ''Come with Us'', was less well received than their previous albums, but nonetheless went straight to No. 1 in the UK Albums Chart in the first week of its release, selling 100,000 copies. In April, the title track from the album was released as a single with remixes by [[Fatboy Slim]] as part of a double A-sided release with \"The Test\".\n\nDuring the summer of 2002, the Chemical Brothers travelled the festival circuit to promote the album. Later in 2002, they released two EPs, one specifically aimed at Japan and the other the US (entitled ''[[AmericanEP]]''). Both contained remixes, live versions and B-sides. Additionally, the band produced [[New Order (band)|New Order]]'s final non-album single \"[[Here to Stay (New Order song)|Here to Stay]]\", and remixed the song as well.\nOne of their other major songs from this album was \"Galaxy Bounce\", which was popular and featured as the main title music for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] game ''[[Project Gotham Racing (video game)|Project Gotham Racing]]''. It was also included on the soundtrack for the movie ''[[Lara Croft: Tomb Raider]]''. \"Star Guitar\" was featured as a song on the [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]]'s ''[[Lumines II]]''.\n\nTwo other songs, \"Come with Us (Introduction)\" and \"Star Guitar (Title Screen)\", were featured on a ''[[PlayStation 2]]'' racing game titled ''WRC II: Extreme''. Both songs are instrumental.\nThe song \"My Elastic Eye\" from the ''Come with Us'' album was played in the 2004 movie ''[[The Butterfly Effect]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0289879/soundtrack |title=The Butterfly Effect (2004) \u2013 Soundtracks |work=Imdb.com |accessdate=24 September 2011}}</ref> starring [[Ashton Kutcher]] and [[Amy Smart]].\n\n=== 2003\u20132006: ''Push the Button'' ===\nEarly 2003 saw Rowlands and Simons back in the studio working on new material, including \"The Golden Path\", a collaboration with [[Wayne Coyne]] of [[the Flaming Lips]]. This was released in September 2003, at the same time as a \"best of\" album, entitled ''[[Singles 93\u201303]]'', marking ten years of the Chemical Brothers' releases. ''Singles 93\u201303'' included most, but not all, of their singles. A second new track, in addition to \"The Golden Path\", was included on the album, called \"Get Yourself High\". ''Singles 93\u201303'' was also released on DVD, with extra features including selected live performances and interviews with Rowlands, Simons, and many of their collaborators from throughout the period. \"Get Yourself High\", which featured Canadian rapper [[k-os]] on vocals, was released as a single in November 2003.\n\nIn late 2003 and 2004, the Chemical Brothers continued to work in the studio on new material and a remix of \"[[Slow (Kylie Minogue song)|Slow]]\" by [[Kylie Minogue]]. After being released on rare white label vinyl, it was subsequently given a commercial release in March on CD (on her next single \"Red Blooded Woman\") and on exclusive 12-inch vinyl picture disc (containing two other Kylie remixes). In Summer 2004 they returned to the festival circuit, including appearances at the [[Glastonbury Festival]], Tokyo, Scotland, and Ireland. They also visited [[South America]] for the second time (the first time being in 1999), arriving at [[Chile]], [[Argentina]], and [[Brazil]]. It was during these sets that they played new material, including \"Acid Children\", which proved to be one of the most popular new tracks.\n\nIn September 2004, the Chemical Brothers released the seventh \"Electronic Battle Weapon\". \"Electronic Battle Weapon 7\" was being released as a one-sided promo-only 12-inch, containing \"Acid Children\". A marked departure from the Chemical Brothers' previous musical endeavours, it featured a screeching 303 bassline and a distinctive vocal sample; a pitch-altered vocal sample proclaiming \"You Are All My Children Now!\", which is lifted from the horror film ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge]]''. It was coupled with the projection of a sinister clown mouthing these same words at their live gigs.\n\nThe Electronic Battle Weapon series of promo releases have typically been newly recorded Chemical Brothers tracks, released on promo to allow DJs to test them in a club environment, and to gauge their popularity.\n\nIn 2004, the Chemical Brothers began work on ''[[Push the Button (The Chemical Brothers album)|Push the Button]]'', their fifth studio album, which features collaborations with [[Tim Burgess (artist)|Tim Burgess]], [[Kele Okereke]], and [[Anwar Superstar]], amongst others. The album was released on 24 January 2005.\n\n\"[[Galvanize (song)|Galvanize]]\", which features rapper [[Q-Tip (rapper)|Q-Tip]] on vocals, was the first single to be taken from ''Push the Button'', and premiered exclusively on [[iTunes]]. The single was released on 17 January 2005, and entered the UK chart at No. 3. The second single, \"[[Believe (Chemical Brothers song)|Believe]]\" (featuring Kele Okereke from [[Bloc Party]]), failed to crack the top 10, but still made it into the top 20, peaking at No. 18. \"The Boxer\", featuring Tim Burgess, became the duo's first single to fail to crack the top 40.\n\nThe album and single \"Galvanize\" won a Grammy at the [[Grammy Awards of 2006]]. One of the songs in this album, \"The Big Jump\", appears in the video game ''[[Burnout Revenge]]'', as well as ''[[Project Gotham Racing 3]]''. The track \"Surface to Air\" features a pulsing chord progression and bassline reminiscent of the intro to the [[The Strokes|Strokes]] song \"The Modern Age\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Chemical action, crowd reaction - Music - www.theage.com.au|url=https://www.theage.com.au/news/Music/Chemical-action-crowd-reaction/2005/01/27/1106415717077.html|website=Theage.com.au|accessdate=13 March 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAn unofficial, remixed version of the album entitled ''Flip the Switch'' was released as a free download, along with the ''Believe'' EP, featuring six further remixes of \"Believe\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chems.musicremixed.org/main.html |title=Flip The Switch \u2013 The Chemical Brothers remixed |accessdate=13 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126182108/http://chems.musicremixed.org/main.html |archivedate=26 January 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn September 2006, the Chemical Brothers were revealed as the first musicians to be involved in Tate Tracks.<ref name=\"Moss\">{{cite web|url=http://www.culture24.org.uk/art/art39863|title=Tate Modern Makes Music With Chemical Brothers For Tate Tracks Project|last=Moss|first=Richard|date=31 August 2006|work=[[Culture24]]|accessdate=9 May 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"TateTracks\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tatetracks.org.uk|title=Tate Tracks|year=2006|publisher=[[Tate]]|accessdate=9 May 2013}}</ref> [[Tate Modern]] invited various groups and songwriters to choose a work that inspired them from the gallery's collection of modern art and then write a track about it.

The double-sided vinyl was finally released just before the Chemical Brothers' much anticipated New Year's Eve gig at the famous [[Turnmills]] in London. The vinyl had a limited edition release worldwide and was received well by fans, DJs, and critics alike. Electronic Battle Weapon 8, at about six and a half minutes, was very distinct from the \"big acid\" style that the earlier Battle Weapons adhered to. It was characterised by 'thundering' drums with a rising synth line. A version of this track featured on the ''We Are the Night'' album and was entitled \"Saturate\". \"Electronic Battle Weapon 9\" was a typical Chemicals dancefloor track with their trademark [[vocoder]] vocals coupled with sirens and a basic 'tribal' melody.\n\nAt the same [[Turnmills]] gig, the Brothers also played a previously unreleased song at midnight to welcome 2007, which went down well with the crowd. This track eventually emerged as \"Burst Generator\", found on the forthcoming album ''We Are the Night''. Many were left wondering if the latest in the Electronic Battle Weapon series were simply one-off experiments or signalled a new direction they could take with the new album, perhaps swaying from their genre defining big beat albums of the past. The song was also the band's 100th released song.\n\nOn 21 March 2007, the Chemical Brothers officially announced their forthcoming album on [[MySpace]]. The new album, entitled ''[[We Are the Night (album)|We Are the Night]]'', was released on 2 July 2007 in the United Kingdom and 17 July 2007 in the United States. The Chemical Brothers cited a delay in the production of artwork for this delay.<ref>[http://www.thechemicalbrothers.com/home/ Album release date announced] \u2013 The Chemical Brothers Official Website {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702042726/http://www.thechemicalbrothers.com/home/ |date=2 July 2012 }}</ref> EMI subsequently released an online Chemical Brothers computer game as an apology.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=23169_0_2_0_C |title=New album The Chemical Brothers delayed - here's a 'sorry guys' |date=18 May 2007 |work=side-line.com |accessdate=24 September 2011}}</ref> The track listing was released to the fans on the official mailing list on 10 April.

The official release of the single was 4 June (digital download) and 14 June (12-inch, 7-inch and CD). The album went on general release in the UK on 2 July 2007.\n\nIn September 2007, the Chemical Brothers played a free live gig in Trafalgar Square as part of the Becks Fusions event. All who attended were provided with 3D glasses to view the on-screen visual effects.\n\nThe Chemical Brothers supplied a new track for the ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]'' soundtrack, titled \"Keep My Composure\". An alternate version of this track was released on ''[[Brotherhood (The Chemical Brothers album)|Brotherhood]]'', the duo's second singles compilation, which also featured the new single \"[[Midnight Madness (song)|Midnight Madness]]\" and a second disc of every Electronic Battle Weapon released to date. The Chemical Brothers continued to tour into 2008 to promote the collection, including a landmark date at [[Olympia London]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hasted |first1=Nick |title=The Chemical Brothers, Olympia, London |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/the-chemical-brothers-olympia-london-915695.html |website=The Independent |accessdate=2019-11-21}}</ref>\n\n=== 2010-2012: ''Further'', ''Hanna'' and ''Don't Think'' ===\nOn 30 March 2010, the band announced on their website that their seventh studio album, titled ''[[Further (The Chemical Brothers album)|Further]]'', would be released on 22 June and would be \"the band's first to be released with corresponding films made specifically to match each of the 8 audio tracks.\" The films were made with long-time visuals collaborators  [[Adam Smith (director)|Adam Smith]] and Marcus Lyall.

It follows the ''[[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]]'' format, which was first developed by [[Endemol]] in the Netherlands. Over thirteen years, ''Bigg Boss'' has rolled out thirteen seasons and one spin-off version.\n\n==Overview==\n\n===Concept===\n''Bigg Boss'' is a reality show based on the original [[Big Brother (Netherlands)|Dutch ''Big Brother'']] format developed by [[John de Mol]]. A number of contestants (known as \"housemates\") live in a [[bespoke|purpose-built]] house and are isolated from the rest of the world. Each week, housemates nominate two of their peers for [[eviction]], and the housemates who receives the most nominations would face a public [[vote]]. Of these, one would eventually leave, having been \"evicted\" from the House. However, there were exceptions to this process as dictated by ''Bigg Boss''. In the final week, there were three housemates remaining, and the public voted for who they wanted to win. The housemates in the Indian version are primarily celebrities with the exception of one who is a non-celebrity selected via auditions. Housemates are overseen by a mysterious person known as 'Bigg Boss', whose only presence in the house is through his voice.<ref name=\"bb\">{{cite web |title=Bigg Boss |url=http://endemol.co.in/what-we-do/non-fiction/big-boss/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728225652/http://endemol.co.in/what-we-do/non-fiction/big-boss/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=28 July 2010 |publisher=Endemol |accessdate=20 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===The house===\nA ''Bigg Boss'' House is built for every season.

It follows the ''[[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]]'' format, which was first developed by [[Endemol]] in the Netherlands. Over thirteen years, ''Bigg Boss'' has rolled out thirteen seasons and one spin-off version.\n\n==Overview==\n\n===Concept===\n''Bigg Boss'' is a reality show based on the original [[Big Brother (Netherlands)|Dutch ''Big Brother'']] format developed by [[John de Mol]]. A number of contestants (known as \"housemates\") live in a [[bespoke|purpose-built]] house and are isolated from the rest of the world. Each week, housemates nominate two of their peers for [[eviction]], and the housemates who receives the most nominations would face a public [[vote]]. Of these, one would eventually leave, having been \"evicted\" from the House. However, there were exceptions to this process as dictated by ''Bigg Boss''. In the final week, there were three housemates remaining, and the public voted for who they wanted to win. The housemates in the Indian version are primarily celebrities with the exception of one who is a non-celebrity selected via auditions. Housemates are overseen by a mysterious person known as 'Bigg Boss', whose only presence in the house is through his voice.<ref name=\"bb\">{{cite web |title=Bigg Boss |url=http://endemol.co.in/what-we-do/non-fiction/big-boss/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728225652/http://endemol.co.in/what-we-do/non-fiction/big-boss/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=28 July 2010 |publisher=Endemol |accessdate=20 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===The house===\nA ''Bigg Boss'' House is built for every season.

It has all kinds of modern amenities, but just one or two bedrooms and four toilet bath rooms. There is a garden, pool, activity area and gym in the House. There is also a Confession Room, where the housemates may be called in by ''Bigg Boss'' for any kind of conversation, and for the nomination process.<ref name=\"rediff\">{{cite web|title=What really goes on in Bigg Boss house?|url=http://movies.rediff.com/slide-show/2009/oct/08/slide-show-1-sneak-peek-into-bigg-boss-house.htm|publisher=[[Rediff]]|accessdate=20 December 2010|author=Rajul Hegde|date=8 October 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe House has no TV connection, no telephones, no Internet connection, clocks, pen or paper.<ref name=\"bb\"/>\n\n===Rules===\nWhile all the rules have never been told to the audience, the most prominent ones are clearly seen.

On Day 100, Jamie was declared the winner of ''Big Brother 2006'', with Camilla the runner-up.<ref name=\"Jamie tells Katie 'I love you'\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/news/tv--radio/jamie-tells-katie-i-love-you/2006/08/01/1154198080424.html|title=Jamie tells Katie 'I love you'|date=1 August 2006|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|access-date=1 August 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016052056/http://www.smh.com.au/news/tv--radio/jamie-tells-katie-i-love-you/2006/08/01/1154198080424.html|archive-date=16 October 2007|url-status=live|publisher=Fairfax Media|agency=Australian Associated Press}}</ref> At the time it was the closest winning margin in any Australian series of the show, later beaten by Series 7 in 2007.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,19980247-2902,00.html|title=Jamie takes home the money|last=|first=|date=1 August 2006|work=[[Herald Sun]]|access-date=1 August 2006}}{{dead link|date=July 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Ratings==\nRatings for '''Big Brother 2006''' were up slightly on the previous year.

''Big Brother 2006'' added the ''save'' vote. Any viewer may cast as many ''evict'' or ''save'' votes as they choose. Prior to eviction each housemates' save votes were merged with their evict votes; the housemate with the highest number of evict votes \u2013 or lowest number of ''save'' votes \u2013 remaining after the merge is evicted.\n\n=== The House ===\nAs with some previous seasons of ''Big Brother'' Australia, a new house with an original layout was constructed for this series. A new feature was the addition of a ''Punishment Room'' to which rule-breaking housemates would be consigned by Big Brother.  Housemates in the ''Punishment Room'' were required to perform tedious, difficult, embarrassing, or mildly painful tasks and jobs, such as sorting white rice from brown rice, sanding a wooden cube into a sphere, or dancing around a [[sombrero]] for hours.\n\n=== Related housemates secret ===\nOne of the twists of ''Big Brother 2006'', promoted in advertising [[hyperbole]] as \"Australia's World First\", was that housemates [[#Karen|Karen]] and [[#Krystal|Krystal]] are mother and daughter. This was not revealed to the other housemates, who were challenged to uncover the secret relationship in the house. The other housemates failed to uncover their secret, and as a reward for success in keeping their secret Karen and Krystal were exempt from being [[Big Brother Australia#Nominations|nominated]] by other housemates in the first round. Karen was later evicted from the House on Day 22.\nIn [[Big Brother 5 (Australia)|''Big Brother 2005'']] a different related-housemates secret task was conducted. Twin brothers [[Greg Mathew|Greg]] and David Mathew were, one at a time, put in the House, and were told to swap places at given times without being noticed by other housemates.  They were given the mission to keep this a secret for the opportunity to be entered into the game as individual housemates each with the chance of winning ''Big Brother 2005''.\n\n=== Big Brother Uncut ===\n2006 saw the renaming of ''Big Brother Uncut'' to ''[[Big Brother Australia#Uncut / Adults Only|Big Brother: Adults Only]]''. Network Ten discontinued ''Adults Only'' early due to pressure from politicians, with the final episode broadcast on 19 June 2006.<ref name=\"Ten shuts Big Brother - Adults Only\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/story/0,20797,19563555-5003402,00.html|title=Ten shuts Big Brother - Adults Only|date=23 June 2006|work=[[The Courier-Mail]]|access-date=4 July 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060715233628/http://www.thecouriermail.news.com.au/story/0,20797,19563555-5003402,00.html|archive-date=15 July 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"Big Brother in bigger bother\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theage.com.au/articles/2006/07/02/1151778811490.html|title=Big Brother in bigger bother|last=Stafford|first=Annabel|date=3 July 2006|work=[[The Age]]|access-date=4 July 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060705010054/http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2006/07/02/1151778811490.html|archive-date=5 July 2006|url-status=live|location=Canberra}}</ref> The content that was to be used on unscreened episodes was made available on a new ''Big Brother Premium'' (paying members) section of the Big Brother website called Adults Only.  {{clear|right}}\n\n== Housemates ==\n{{main|List of Big Brother (Australian TV series) season 6 housemates}}\nFifteen '''''Big Brother 2006 housemates''''' entered at the beginning of the season.

The two Housemates with the most Nomination Points would be given a fake Eviction and moved into the Revenge Room, where they would be able to watch their fellow Housemates, see who Nominated them, and enact their revenge without their fellow Housemates knowing. Anna and Camilla received the most Nomination Points and were moved into the Revenge Room, where they remained for forty-eight hours.\n* {{note|2|Note 2}}: Anna and Camilla were in the Revenge Room during this Week's Nominations and could not Nominate, nor be Nominated. Because Michael failed his Insider task to expose the relationship between Karen and Krystal he automatically faced the Public Vote. This Week Karen and Krystal Nominated as a single entity, represented by Karen.\n* {{note|3|Note 3}}: Michael was [[Immunity (reality television)|immune]] from Nominations after he passed his Insider Mission. Karen and Krystal Nominated as one entity represented by Krystal.\n* {{note|4|Note 4}}: Michael was set an Insider Mission to be Nominated by at least eight Housemates \u2013 and as nine Housemates Nominated him he passed and was Immune from Nomination this Week.\n* {{note|5|Note 5}}: Michael's Insider position was relinquished, and taken over by Jade, therefore Michael's eligibility for Nomination no longer rested upon Insider Missions. New Housemates Danielle, Jade and Rob were Exempt from the Nomination process in their first Week in the House. Michael and Katie were each awarded an extra point by Big Brother for giving poor Nomination reasons.\n* {{note|6|Note 6}}: After Nominations, which saw Camilla, Dino, Jade and Krystal Nominated, for Danielle to save Krystal using the three point twist \u2013 reducing the line-up to Camilla, Dino and Jade. After Nominations Big Brother Nominated five other Housemates considered to be operating \"under the radar\" \u2013 deliberately staying quiet and avoiding controversy so as not to be Nominated. The five Nominated were Ashley, Claire, Gaelan, John and Krystal, and the Public were allowed to vote for two more to be added to the Nomination line-up. The Public chose Krystal (31%) and John (30%) to be added to the Nomination line-up. Therefore, Camilla, Dino, Jade, John and Krystal would face the Public Vote this Week, which would be a Double Eviction.\n* {{note|7|Note 7}}: Big Brother awarded Ashley and Katie one extra point each for not giving valid Nomination reasons.\n* {{note|8|Note 8}}: Shortly before Rob's Eviction Housemates had to choose which of the three new Intruders (Darren, Lauren and Perry) would leave. Housemates named one Intruder they would like to Evict (top of Nomination Box) and one they would like to save (bottom of Nomination Box). When the Intruder's save votes were deducted from their evict votes Lauren had the highest score (with one Eviction Point) and was Evicted shortly before Rob. None of the Intruders could Nominate in the Intruder Vote.\n* {{note|9|Note 9}}: New Housemates Darren and Perry were Exempt from the Nomination process. Big Brother added one point to John, after he failed to give adequate reasons for Nominating. Jamie was banned from Nominating for previously discussing Nominations.\n* {{note|10|Note 10}}: Big Brother awarded one point to both Claire and Perry for giving inadequate Nomination reasons.\n* {{note|11|Note 11}}: Week 14 was the final week. Chris was evicted on Day 95, with Max and David following on Day 99. For the next 24 hours, the public were voting for a winner, either Camilla or Jamie.\n</small>\n\n==Weekly summary and highlights==\n\n===Week 1===\n(up to and including Sunday night)\n* Michael McCoy was the first to enter the house, followed by Camilla Severi.\n* Soon after entering the House, housemate Michael McCoy was issued with, and accepted, the challenge by Big Brother to act as a secret saboteur in the House, known officially as the Insider.  He was to play specific pranks at Big Brother's command, to work against and annoy other housemates, and to attempt to stymie the housemates' attempts to successfully complete assigned compulsory tasks.  He had to remain undetected in these strategies and keep his role as the Insider a secret, or be automatically nominated for eviction.\n* Michael McCoy failed his first mission within minutes of receiving it, and received his first strike because of it.\n* Through his diary room discussions with Big Brother, viewers learned that David is gay but had not disclosed this to his fellow housemates. David [[coming out|came out]] to them on Wednesday, 26 April 2006.\n* Gaelan won the first [[Big Brother (Australia)#Friday Night Live|''Big Brother Friday Night Live 2006'']], and chose runner-up Katie as his partner in the ''Rewards Room''. The theme was Cavemen.\n* A new twist was revealed to the Housemates; a fourth prize would be awarded to the winner of ''Friday Night Live''. Three sealed boxes would be presented to the winner, marked 1, 2 and 3. The winner would select one box only before being allowed to open the box of their choice. The three boxes would inevitably contain a major prize (an overseas holiday), a medium-sized prize, and a booby prize. The three prizes would follow a theme or be associated with each other in a homonymous manner (e.g. ''Cam''bodia, ''cam''era, ''Cam''embert).\n* The three boxes were presented to Gaelan. They contained a trip to Thailand, a Thai banquet for all of the Housemates for the following night, and a large red bow tie. Gaelan chose the box containing the novelty bow tie.\n* Krystal revealed to the house that Karen was her mother.\n* On Day 8, Big Brother asked housemates to nominate which two they found 'Most Annoying'.  The two who had the highest nominations were Anna and Camilla.  They were both evicted from the house but unknown to the remaining housemates never left the compound and were sent to the Revenge Room. From there they could view the activities in the house and were given a task to enact revenge on their housemates for nominating them.\n* Prize money at the end of Week 1 was $820,000.\n\n===Week 2===\n* Monday, 1 May saw the first official nominations of series 6. Elise, Tilli, Claire, and Dino were nominated. Michael was also up for nomination after failing his Insider task.\n* On 2 May, the two isolated Housemates, Anna and Camilla, were returned to the House in [[#Revenge Room Return|''Revenge Room Return'']].  Both were immune to nomination points received during [[#Week 3|Week 3]]'s [[Big Brother Australia#Nominations|''Nominations'']].\n* Dino wins the second ''Friday Night Live'' and takes runner-up Claire to the Rewards Room. The theme for the night is the Farmyard. The three boxes contain a trip to Cambodia, a digital camera, and some Camembert cheese. Dino chooses the box containing the Camembert cheese.\n* Tilli and Elise were evicted in a double eviction on 7 May.\n* Prize money at the end of Week 2 was $665,000.\n\n===Week 3===\n* Michael McCoy surviving eviction in week two became a controversial character within the House\n* Karen, Krystal and Camilla were nominated.\n* Michael McCoy's 'Insider challenge' for the week was to ensure that he was nominated by eight Housemates in the next week's nominations.  Success would mean immunity from eviction for the week.  He spun a complex and fictitious tale of a son called Reuben and a paternity test supposedly taken shortly before he entered the House that revealed he was not (as he had believed for nearly nine years) Reuben's biological father, in a bid to make other Housemates think he wanted to leave the house.\n* Michael McCoy won ''Friday Night Live'', choosing Ashley to join him in the Rewards Room. The theme for the night was Back To Work (an office theme). The three boxes contained a trip to China, complimentary Chinese laundry services for three Housemates for the week, and a Chinese fortune cookie. Michael McCoy chose the box containing the laundry services.\n* Housemates held a mock wedding for Jamie and Katie.\n* Michael McCoy's deception began tearing the house apart as Housemates did not know what to believe\n* Karen was evicted on 14 May.\n* Prize money at the end of Week 3 was $610,000.\n\n===Week 4===\n* Michael succeeded in his Insider task to get eight housemates to nominate him and therefore was safe from eviction. Michael used his ''Three Point Twist'' to save Dino from eviction. Camilla, Ashley, Anna, David, and Krystal were up for eviction.\n* Michael's 'Insider' role was revealed to the house by Big Brother. Many housemates felt that Michael had betrayed them.\n* All three Intruders, Rob, Jade, and Danielle, went into the house at different times during the night during Day 24.\n* Michael and David nearly shared a kiss in the bathroom. It was later revealed by Michael on [[Rove (TV series)|Rove Live]], and also during \"The Gretel Incident\" that it was a joke.\n* Gaelan won the rockstar-themed [[Big Brother Australia#Friday Night Live|''Friday Night Live'']], his second ''Friday Night Live'' win.  He invited Krystal to the ''Rewards Room''. They received a special prize: a dinner at Tiger Island (situated inside [[Dreamworld (Australian theme park)|Dreamworld]], but outside the Big Brother House). This prize was hailed as another of [[Big Brother (Australia)|''Big Brother Australia'']]'s \"''World First''\"s, due to the notion that these two Housemates left the confines of the House as part of the game, and were returned an hour later.\n* Anna was evicted on 21 May.\n* Jade was voted as the new Insider by the public and was notified that night.\n* Prize money at the end of Week 4 was $545,000.\n\n===Week 5===\n* Originally, Michael McCoy, Camilla, and David were nominated. Because he won ''Friday Night Live'', Gaelan used his ''Three Point Twist'' on David, changing the final eviction line-up to Michael McCoy, Camilla, and John.\n* Katie gives Dino the challenge of having to remain within 5 metres of Camilla for half the day in exchange for Katie's bread rations. When Camilla found Dino spending most of the day with her she thought he might have been interested in her.\n* Katie celebrated her 20th birthday on 23 May. Big Brother threw a surprise birthday party for her in the Rewards Room. The party had a Hawaiian beach theme where all the housemates dressed in Hawaiian costumes. Dino and Intruder Danielle pash at Katie's party. Camilla was upset because she thought Dino was interested in her.\n* Jade's first Insider mission was on 23 May, where she was only allowed to sing and not speak in her usual manner from sunrise to sunset. She spent the day in silence in an effort to complete her task, only having to resort to singing on a few occasions.\n* On 24 May, Michael McCoy stole a number of Housemates' toothbrushes and hid them in a sock under a bed in an effort to create conflict and entertainment within the House. The housemates never found the toothbrushes despite Big Brother showing the housemates where they were located. Michael McCoy never admitted he was the culprit. Michael did all of this of his own accord, having been relieved of his Insider role the previous week.\n* Intruder Danielle won ''Friday Night Live'', and chose John to join her in the Rewards Room. The theme for the night was Horror Night. The three boxes contained a trip to South Africa, a motor scooter, and a salad sandwich. Danielle chose the box containing the sandwich.\n* Michael McCoy was evicted from the House on 28 May. His farewell message implicated another housemate in the theft of the toothbrushes\n* Prize money at the end of Week 5 was $500,000.\n\n===Week 6===\n* Big Brother played the video of Michael Mccoy stealing the toothbrushes before nomination.\n* Originally in general nominations, Jade, Dino, Camilla, and Krystal were nominated. Because Danielle won the Friday Night Games, Danielle used her ''Three Point Twist'' on Krystal, removed Krystal from the list of nominees.\n* [[#Under the Radar|''Under the Radar'']] nominations took place on Day 38 (29 May). This allowed the public to nominate a housemate on the basis of whether they have been using the \"under the radar\" strategy. Big Brother chose Krystal, John, Gaelan, Clare, Ashley as the ''\"Under the Radar\"'' candidates and viewer votes resulted in Krystal and John being added to nominations.\n* During the Nominations show, evicted housemate Michael McCoy and host Gretel Killeen have a heated interview about whether ''Big Brother'' used editing techniques to misconstrue an incident where Michael appeared to express a desire to kiss David. Killeen strongly defended the series, insisting that misleading editing techniques are not used. McCoy claims the kissing incident was a joke but that by cutting the shot too soon, it appeared in the footage as broadcast to be serious.  Killeen clearly appeared uneasy and ambivalent about defending the actions of the ''Big Brother'' program when later in the ''[[Big Brother (Australia)#Nominations|Nominations]]'' show, she apologised to Michael McCoy and the 'full' footage is shown. This includes only a few seconds extra of footage, albeit from a different angle, in which it appears the move by David and Michael to kiss each other may have been a joke.\n* Katie was the winner of ''Friday Night Live'', and choose Jamie to join her in the rewards room. The theme was [[Caribbean]]. The prizes in the three boxes were a dreadlock, a motor scooter, and a $1000 JeansWest gift voucher. Katie selected the box with the motor scooter. (She was the first housemate to pick the best prize in this series)\n* Jade succeeded in her Insider task which gave her a one-week immunity from nominations in the next week if she survived eviction on 3 June.\n* Jade and Dino were evicted on Day 43, 4 June.\n* Prize money at the end of Week 6 was $470,000.\n\n===Week 7===\n* Rob, Danielle, and Camilla were nominated for eviction. Katie used her 3-point twist from winning ''Friday Night Live'' to remove points from Camilla \u2013 even though she nominated her herself \u2013 and this did not affect the nominations.\n* Danielle's 19th birthday was on Day 47 (8 June 2006).  A Horror-themed birthday party, themed by the housemates' current task, took place.  During the party Danielle incurred a $5000 fine and was sent to the Punishment Room to clean dirty dentures after speaking without her microphone.\n* David won a [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] themed ''[[Big Brother Australia#Friday Night Live|Friday Night Live]]'' and takes Camilla to the Rewards Room.  The ''Three Boxes'' contained a Vietnam trekking holiday, an Xbox 360, and a photo of the ex-housemates. David picked the box containing the holiday.\n* Danielle was evicted on Day 50, 11 June.\n* Prize money at the end of Week 7 was $390,000.\n\n===Week 8===\n* Ashley, David, Jamie, and Katie were nominated for eviction.  David used his ''Three Point Twist'' on Ashley, changing the eviction line-up to David, Jamie, and Katie. This was the first week Camilla had not been nominated where she was eligible to be nominated.\n* Jamie, Katie and John each received a strike for discussing nominations.\n* John won \"[[Alternative words for British#Pommy|Pommy]] Night\", a British-themed [[Big Brother Australia#Friday Night Live|''Friday Night Live'']] and took [[#Claire|Claire]] into the Rewards Room with him.  The three boxes contained a [[digital camera]], a [[mug]], and a trip to Africa.  He picked Box 3, and won a digital camera.\n* Claire celebrated her 23rd birthday on 17 June, and had an animal-themed birthday party where the housemates had to dress up in animal costumes.\n* Katie was evicted on Day 57, 18 June.\n* Prize money at the end of Week 8 was $375,000.\n\n===Week 9===\n* Camilla, Jamie, and Rob were nominated for eviction.  John used his ''Three Point Twist'' on Jamie, but it did not change the final lineup of nominations.\n* John was given a strike and banned from ''Friday Night Live'' for discussing nominations and alluding to whom he removed points from as part of the ''Three Point Twist''. Jamie was given a warning for the same discussion.\n* Three more Intruders ([[#Perry|Perry]], [[#Darren|Darren]], and [[#Lauren|Lauren]]) entered the house on 21 June's (Day 60) [[#Intruders \u2013 Incoming|''Intruders \u2013 Incoming'']] show.\n* Two federal government backbenchers complained about ''[[Big Brother Australia#Uncut / Adults Only|Big Brother \u2013 Adults Only]]'', despite the show been extremely toned down this year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/tv--radio/big-brother-in-hot-water-again/2006/06/20/1150701537694.html|title=Big Brother in hot water again|date=20 June 2006|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|access-date=21 June 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021194218/http://www.smh.com.au/news/tv--radio/big-brother-in-hot-water-again/2006/06/20/1150701537694.html|archive-date=21 October 2007|url-status=live|publisher=Fairfax Media|agency=Australian Associated Press}}</ref>\n* Network Ten crumbles to the pressure of these conservative MPs and pulls ''Adults Only'' from air early, announcing on 23 June 2006 that the program had \"completed its season run\".<ref name=\"Ten shuts Big Brother - Adults Only\"/>\n* Day 62's [[Big Brother Australia#Friday Night Live|''Friday Night Live'']] was themed \"Bugs Night\". and  all of the games were bug related.  Claire won the Friday Night Games, defeating Gaelan in the final round. After inviting Rob to join her in the ''Rewards Room'', she won a trip to China from the three boxes.\n* [[#Krystal|Krystal]] was injured during Day 62's Friday Night Games, and had to leave the Friday Night Live arena.  She was treated by a doctor in the [[#House|''Spare Room'']], receiving nine stitches under her chin. She was also unable to compete in the following week's FNL.\n* [[#Lauren|Lauren]] was evicted on Day 64 in a Housemates' vote where they had to decide which of the new Intruders they wanted to see go.\n* [[#Rob|Rob]] was evicted on Day 64.\n* Prize money at the end of Week 9 was $325,000.\n\n=== Week 10 ===\n* David, Gaelan, and Krystal were nominated for eviction.

The ''Three Boxes'' contained a trip to Thailand, an [[Xbox 360]], and a pair of chopsticks. David chose the Thailand holiday, winning him a second holiday.\n* On Day 70 (1 July 2006), Ashley allegedly slapped his genitals in Camilla's face while John held her down, at approximately 04:30; Ashley and John were escorted from the house by security later that day. As a result, the ''Big Brother'' forum on the official website was taken offline until further notice after fans flooded the forum with posts discussing the incident. This was the first time the forum had been taken offline since the \"Belindagate\" incident of [[Big Brother Australia 2003|''Big Brother 2003'']]. ''Behind Big Brother Australia'' reported that the reason was for sexual harassment towards Camilla.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.behindbigbrother.com/showarticle.php?articleID=934|title=Ash, John sexually assault Camilla and are escorted from the house|date=1 July 2006|website=Behind Big Brother Australia|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060705060832/http://www.behindbigbrother.com/showarticle.php?articleID=934|archivedate=5 July 2006|url-status=dead|df=dmy}}</ref> While the housemates were made aware of this, the live feeds were cut, and in their place was an old [[Big Brother Australia#UpLate|''UpLate'']] ''Update'' of the housemates doing their Football task on a continuous loop.

The three boxes contained a [[peanut butter and jelly sandwich]], a Swiss army gadget and a trip through South-America, including Bolivia and Chile. Darren chose box three, revealed to contain the Swiss army gadget.\n* Shortly after Perry's eviction on Sunday, 9 July 2006, [[Gretel Killeen]] announced during the eviction show that, unbeknown to the current housemates, two new male housemates would be entering the house as replacements for Ashley and John.\n* Prize money at the end of Week 11 stood at $265,000.\n\n===Week 12===\n* Darren, David, and Camilla were nominated for eviction. Darren used his ''Three Point Twist'' on himself. This reduction in his nomination points tally brought him into the third-place tied position with Krystal, adding Krystal to the eviction line-up.\n* Day 80 (11 July) saw the induction of two new housemates entering the compound. They are 20-year-old [[#Max|Max]] and 22-year-old [[#Chris|Chris]], both from [[New South Wales]]. Unlike ''Intruder'' housemates, Chris and Max can nominate and be nominated immediately. Max entered during the special one-hour show [[#The New Housemates|''The New Housemates'']], where he posed as Darren in a pirate costume, quickly being identified. Chris, was held in the ''revenge room'', and entered the House live on [[Rove (TV series)|Rove]].\n* Krystal's 20th Birthday was on Day 81 (12 July 2006).  She had a Hollywood-themed party.\n* On Day 82, Camilla received a $5,000 fine for referring to Big Brother by another name. This fine brought the remaining prize money total to $250,000, the prize offered in the first three seasons of Big Brother Australia.\n* On Day 83 (14 July 2006), Jamie wins Friday Night Live, taking Camilla to the rewards room with him.\n* Darren was evicted on Day 85, with 73% of the merged vote, the highest eviction percentage this series.\n* Prize money at the end of Week 12 stood at $235,000.\n\n===Week 13===\n* David, Chris, and Camilla were nominated for eviction. As winner of [[Big Brother Australia#Friday Night Live|''Friday Night Live'']], Jamie used his ''Three Point Twist'' to save Camilla. This reduction in Camilla's nomination points caused the final nominees to be David, Chris, Max, Krystal, and Claire, leaving only Jamie and Camilla free from possible eviction.\n* On Day 90 (21 July), Jamie won the [[Christmas in July]]-themed ''Friday Night Live'', taking Chris with him to the rewards room. This was Jamie's second consecutive win.  Jamie is presented with six mystery prizes boxes to choose from, rather than the usual three. The box he chose won him a scooter.\n* In a [[Big Brother Australia#Eviction|''Double Eviction'']] on Day 92, Claire and Krystal were evicted.<ref name=\"Girls out in shock evictions\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theage.com.au/news/tv--radio/girls-out-in-shock-evictions/2006/07/24/1153593246011.html|title=Girls out in shock evictions|date=24 July 2006|work=[[The Age]]|access-date=24 July 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516212708/http://www.theage.com.au/news/tv--radio/girls-out-in-shock-evictions/2006/07/24/1153593246011.html|archive-date=16 May 2007|url-status=live|publisher=Fairfax Media|agency=Australian Associated Press (AAP)}}</ref>\n* At the end of Week 13, total prize money stood at $215,000.<ref name=\"Girls out in shock evictions\"/>\n\n===Week 14===\n* Jamie, Max, and Chris were up for eviction.  As winner of [[Big Brother Australia#Friday Night Live|''Friday Night Live'']] Jamie used his ''Three Point Twist'' to remove nomination points from himself.  This successfully removed Jamie from the line up, and resulted in David and Camilla joining the line up of housemates up for eviction.\n* A surprise eviction was held on Wednesday, 26 July (Day 95) in which Chris was evicted with 69% of the merged vote.\n* After Chris's eviction Big Brother announced to the remaining four housemates that they are all nominated for eviction.\n* During the Surprise Eviction show host Gretel Killeen announced that the next eviction will be on Sunday night, and it will be a double eviction.\n* [[Network Ten]] advertised [[#The Prize Fight|''The Prize Fight'']], a special [[Big Brother Australia#Friday Night Live|''Friday Night Live'']], to take place on Day 97, in which the remaining housemates would have the chance to reclaim some of their lost prize money. Housemates were put to the test through a range of obstacles, varying in difficulty and value. Because of their efforts, the final four managed to secure an additional $311,000. This brought the prize money to $511,000.\n* At the conclusion of [[#The Prize Fight|''The Prize Fight'']], Big Brother announced that the final housemate standing would win the prize money, less all fines they had accumulated during their time in the house. This means that out of $511,000 in prize money, Camilla could have won $406,000; David could have won $446,000; Jamie could have won $426,000, and did; and Max could have won $496,000.\n* On Day 98, one housemate was invited into the ''Diary Room''. Camilla entered, and received a celebratory reception as she was informed she was the 1500th visitor to the Big Brother diary room. She was then told that she, and three friends in the house, would later that day dine with Big Brother. While the housemates had their meal with Big Brother, they were oblivious to the fact that one of each had a loved one in the house, leaving a gift for them. Max's mother cooked his favourite meal and left it simmering on the stove, David's mother left his saddle and boots for him in the bedroom, Camilla's friend left her some clothes and personal possessions, and Jamie's mother left him a clean pair of fisherman pants, a new headband and a much-needed belt.\n* Max, and soon after, David, were evicted on Day 99 in [[#Final Sunday Eviction|''Final Sunday Eviction'']].  David was the first housemate to be evicted despite his save votes outnumbering his evict votes; in this nomination Max was the only housemate to have a greater number of evict votes than save votes.\n* Disqualified housemates John and Ashley were excluded from participating in the 2006 [[Big Brother Australia#Finale|''Finale'']]; all other former ''Big Brother 2006'' housemates appeared in the show.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,19939236-5001026,00.html|title=Final insult|last=|first=|date=2006-07-29|work=The Daily Telegraph|access-date=2006-08-01|url-status=dead}}{{Dead link|date=May 2018}}</ref>\n* While inside the house, [[#Jamie|Jamie]] was announced winner of ''Big Brother 2006'', while [[#Camilla|Camilla]] was runner-up.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/articles/2006/07/31/1154198079738.html|title=Turkey-slapped then robbed|last=Moses|first=Alexa|date=1 August 2006|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|access-date=1 August 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070329040650/http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2006/07/31/1154198079738.html|archive-date=29 March 2007|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2006/07/31/1154198078725.html|title=Big Brother contestant saw a winner in the mirror|last=Edwards|first=Lorna|date=1 August 2006|work=[[The Age]]|access-date=1 August 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022065348/http://theage.com.au/articles/2006/07/31/1154198078725.html|archive-date=22 October 2007|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==House==\nThe ''Big Brother 2006'' House had the following areas and facilities:\n[[File:BB06-Houseplan.SVG|450px|thumb|Floorplan of the ''Big Brother'' House as designed in 2006]]\n* Kitchen\n* Lounge\n* Dining Room\n* Bedroom (split by a dividing wall)\n* Bathroom\n* Sauna\n* Yard\n* Pool\n* Gym\n* Spa\n* Rewards Room\n* Animal enclosure\n* Shop\n* Friday Night Live Arena\n* Air lock, Diary Room, and Eviction exit\n* Punishment Room\n* Spare room, which has been used as the ''Revenge Room'' and the ''Exit Room''\n\n== Fines ==\n{{main|Big Brother (Australia)#Fines}}\nThe Prize Fund at the beginning of ''Big Brother 2006'' was [[Australian dollar|A$]]1,000,000, however following on from [[Big Brother Australia 2005|''Big Brother 2005'']], the housemates were fined $5000 a time for committing various offences.  In Big Brother 2006, the housemates were not allowed any grace period that ''Big Brother 2005'' housemates experienced, and fines were awarded within minutes of all the housemates entering the House on launch night.  Following the first week, the ''Punishment Room'' was revealed, where housemates were often sent after receiving their $5,000 fine from Big Brother. \nHousemates were also repeatedly warned that once a fine has been incurred, that money could never be regained. After final four housemates added '''$311,000''' back to the remaining '''$200,000''' prize money taking it to '''$511,000''' during the last Friday Night Games they were told that whoever wins Big Brother 2006 will have their fines deducted from the prize money. \nThe fine tallies of the lowest and highest were from Lauren Clayton who received no fines and Camilla Severi who clocked up '''$105,000'''.\n\n== Special shows ==\n\n=== The Insider AKA Michael McCoy ===\n'''The Insider''' was a live show, broadcast on Day 2, where the result of the Insider public vote was revealed. Viewers had to vote for whether David, Camilla, or Michael should be appointed the Insider. The [[Big Brother Australia#Daily Show|''Daily Show'']] was broadcast as part of ''The Insider''.  Hosted by [[Gretel Killeen]]. Michael McCoy was selected as the insider Michael McCoy (born 16 June 1980) is a political science student from Sydney, New South Wales. He is of Anglo-Celtic and Filipino descent. Michael was the first housemate to enter the Big Brother House this year.\nOn Day 2, he was given the task of the Insider by Big Brother, having been chosen by the viewing public. If he succeeded in his tasks, he would be immune from being nominated, but if he failed he would automatically be put up for eviction.\n\nHe failed his first mission within minutes of being assigned the task, which was to secretly spill water on a bed that was occupied by two housemates. Michael opted to spill water on Gaelan's bed, which at the time was only used by Gaelan himself. Because of that, and because he also didn't empty the whole bottle, he was awarded his first strike. Soon after, he was given other missions, one of which was to be nominated by at least eight of his fellow housemates in the next round of nominations. To complete this mission he fabricated a story about a custody issue concerning his young son Reuben, claiming he wanted to leave the house to concentrate on this issue.\n\nAfter Big Brother revealed to the other housemates that Michael was the Insider, and that the Reuben story was pure fiction, Michael faced a strong backlash from several housemates angry at being duped in this way, especially from Anna who had little contact with her father. It was revealed on Michael's eviction night that Reuben is the name of one of Michael's real life friends. Despite no longer being the Insider, Michael continued to cause conflict in Week 5, hiding cutlery as well as hiding the housemates' toothbrushes from them, never revealing their locations even after he had been evicted, attempting to create doubts as to whether or not there is another insider inside the house besides Michael. He was the 5th housemate to be evicted from the house on Day 36, with 20% of the merged vote.\n\nThe day after he was evicted, Michael appeared on the Nominations show and had a heated discussion with Gretel Killeen about the producers' editing regarding a scene where Michael and housemate David appeared to be kissing. The outfall resulted in media attention and the interview with Gretel was later labelled \"The Gretel Incident\" by fans due to Gretel's hostile interviewing tactics during the scene. The day after this incident Michael appeared on Rove Live and when host Rove McManus insulted Michael, the former housemate returned fire by bluntly telling Rove he wasn't as funny as the show's co-host Peter Helliar.\n\nWhen asked about \"The Gretel Incident\", Michael suggested that Friday Night Live and Big Brother UpLate host Mike Goldman, or Friday Night Live co-host and former housemate Ryan Fitzgerald, would be better hosts of Big Brother than Gretel Killeen. As has become custom over the history of the show, Michael appeared along with all the other 2006 housemates on the Rove Live episode of the week of the final. In his usual style he said what everyone wanted to say but were too afraid to. As soon as he was asked to speak, he immediately questioned why John and Ashley were not present, and attempted to get the host to bring them on.\n\n=== Surprise Eviction ===\n'''Surprise Eviction''' was a live show that was broadcast on the first Sunday (Day 8) following [[Big Brother Australia#Launch|''Launch'']], where the housemates each had to vote for two of the housemates that they wanted to see evicted.  Kept hidden from them was the fact that the two housemates with the most votes, [[#Anna|Anna]] and [[#Camilla|Camilla]], were not evicted; but were sent to the ''Revenge Room'' to secretly cause havoc on the house.  Hosted by [[Gretel Killeen]].\n\n=== Unforgettable ===\n'''Unforgettable''' was a special live show aired on Day 9. Hosted by Gretel Killeen.\n\n=== Revenge Room Return ===\n'''Revenge Room Return''' was a special live show aired on Day 10, two days after Anna and Camilla were evicted to the Revenge Room in [[#Special Eviction|''Special Eviction'']].  The  one-hour episode incorporated the [[Big Brother Australia#Daily Show|Daily Show]]. It ended with [[#Anna|Anna]] and [[#Camilla|Camilla]] re-entering the house as [[#John|John]]'s special birthday gift.  Hosted by [[Gretel Killeen]].\n\n===Intruders Go In===\n'''Intruders Go In''' was a live special held on Day 24 (16 May 2006), when housemates [[#Rob|Rob]], [[#Danielle|Danielle]] and [[#Jade|Jade]] were revealed and entered the House as [[Big Brother Australia#Intruders|Intruders]] throughout the night. Footage of Michael being revealed as the Insider to the housemates was also shown, including the reaction of the housemates. Rob entered first towards the end of the special. Jade entered the house shortly before ''[[Rove (TV series)|Rove Live]]'', and Danielle entered during [[Big Brother Australia#UpLate|''UpLate'']].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bigbrother.3mobile.com.au/news/article_154.asp|title=Intruders have landed!|website=Big Brother official site|publisher=[[Endemol Southern Star]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060521235735/http://bigbrother.3mobile.com.au/news/article_154.asp|archive-date=21 May 2006|url-status=dead|access-date=26 June 2006}}</ref>\n\n=== Truth, Lies, Eviction ===\n'''Truth, Lies, Eviction''' was a live show used on Day 36.  Big Brother felt that some housemates were lying or holding back on things about themselves, therefore flying [[#Under the Radar|''Under the Radar'']].  On Day 35, each housemate went into the diary room and was asked some questions.  A lie-risk detector, said to be 90% accurate, was used to determine from the frequency of their voice whether or not they were lying.  They weren't informed that a lie detector was used, or what the information would be used for until during ''Truth, Lies, Eviction'' was broadcast.  The show also featured [[#Michael|Michael]]'s eviction, and the [[Big Brother Australia#Daily Show|Daily Show]] was broadcast as part of ''Truth, Lies, Eviction''.\n\n=== Under the Radar ===\n'''Under the Radar''' was a show that aired during Day 38.  Based on the results of Day 36's [[#Truth, Lies, Eviction|''Truth, Lies, Eviction'']] show, Big Brother selected five housemates that he felt weren't contributing to the house, who were intentionally acting in a reserved manner to avoid conflict and thereby avoid being nominated, or flying ''Under the Radar''. These housemates were up for a 24-hour public vote to decide which of them would be added to the list of housemates up for eviction that week. The public vote started on Day 37's ''[[Big Brother Australia#Nominations|Nominations]]'' show.  The housemates Big Brother felt were \"flying under the radar\" were Ashley, Claire, Gaelan, John, and Krystal. Based on viewer votes John and Krystal were added to the list of housemates up for eviction. On [[Big Brother Australia#Eviction|''Eviction'']] night, neither of them were evicted.\n\n=== Intruders \u2013 Incoming ===\n'''Intruders \u2013 Incoming''' was a live show that was broadcast on Day 60 (21 June 2006).  In the show, new Intruders [[#Darren|Darren]], and [[#Perry|Perry]] entered the house.  [[#Lauren|Lauren]] entered the House later, in [[Big Brother Australia#UpLate|''UpLate'']].  The [[Big Brother Australia#Daily Show|Daily Show]] was broadcast as part of ''Intruders \u2013 Incoming''.  The show was hosted by [[Gretel Killeen]].\n\n===Housemates on Trial===\n'''Housemates on Trial''' was a live show that aired on Day 67 (28 June 2006). This special replaced a previously advertised special where housemates were to be hypnotised by hypnotist, Peter Powers,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bigbrother.3mobile.com.au/news/article_336.asp|title=Housemates on Trial|date=26 June 2006|website=Big Brother official site|publisher=[[Endemol Southern Star]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060627184253/http://bigbrother.3mobile.com.au/news/article_336.asp|archive-date=27 June 2006|url-status=dead|access-date=28 June 2006}}</ref> because not enough housemates consented to being hypnotised for enough footage to be produced for a special.  In this special, Housemates were asked a series of questions previously submitted by viewers and were run through a Layered Voice Analysis device to determine how honest the housemates were with their answers. This device did not require housemates to give yes or no answers. This special ran in a similar format to the previous special ''[[#Truth, Lies, Eviction|Truth, Lies, Eviction]]'', except without an Eviction. The show was hosted by [[Gretel Killeen]].\n\n=== The New Housemates ===\n'''The New Housemates''' was a live show aired on Day 80 (11 July 2006), where new housemates [[#Max|Max]] and [[#Chris|Chris]], both from [[New South Wales]], entered the house to replace [[#Ashley|Ashley]] and [[#John|John]].  Unlike Intruders, Chris and Max could nominate and be nominated immediately (the next opportunity to nominate would be six days later).  Max entered during the special one-hour show, where he posed as Darren in a pirate costume, quickly being identified. Chris entered live during [[Rove (TV series)|''Rove'']].  The ''[[Big Brother Australia#Daily Show|Daily Show]]'' was broadcast as part of ''The New Housemates''.\n\n=== Surprise Eviction ===\n'''Surprise Eviction''' was a live show on Day 95 (26 July 2006). The show was hosted by [[Gretel Killeen]].\n\n=== The Prize Fight ===\n'''The Prize Fight''' was a special [[Big Brother Australia#Friday Night Live|''Friday Night Live'']] that was broadcast on Day 97 (28 July 2006).  This was the last ''Friday Night Live'' of ''Big Brother 2006''.  The housemates were told by Big Brother that there would be no ''Rewards Room'', ''Three Boxes'', or ''Three Point Twist'' to compete for; and no chores to allocate; but would instead be given the opportunity to win any amount up to $416,000 to add to the prize fund of $200,000, depending on what percentage of the games they successfully completed.  [[Ryan Fitzgerald]], co-host of ''Friday Night Live'', was involved in one of the games, as an \"Ex-Professional Football Player\".  At the end of the games, the housemates were told that they added $311,000 to the prize fund, giving the winner the opportunity to win $511,000, less all the fines the winning housemate had incurred during their stay in the ''Big Brother'' House as they were all repeatedly warned that their fine money could never be regained.\n* While in the house, [[#Max|Max]] received fines totaling $15,000.  If Max won ''Big Brother 2006'', he would have received $496,000.\n* While in the house, [[#David|David]] received fines totaling $65,000. If David won ''Big Brother 2006'', he would have received $446,000.\n* While in the house, [[#Jamie|Jamie]] received fines totaling $85,000; and he received $426,000 as winner of ''Big Brother 2006''.\n* While in the house, [[#Camilla|Camilla]] received fines totaling $105,000; more than any other housemate in Big Brother history.  Therefore, if Camilla had won ''Big Brother 2006'', she would have received $406,000.\n\n=== Surprise Visit ===\n'''Surprise Visit''' was the last [[Big Brother Australia#Daily Show|''Daily Show'']] of ''Big Brother 2006'', and was broadcast on Day 99 (30 July 2006).  Camilla won a date with Big Brother as she had been the 1500th Housemate to use the ''Diary Room'', and was able to take three of her closest friends, this being all of the other housemates in the House with her at the time.  While they were in the ''Diary Room'' on their date, David's, Jamie's, and Max's mothers; and Camilla's best friend, had entered the House to cook food and leave items that the housemates would recognise.  After their departure, the housemates were allowed back into the House to watch a video message of their loved ones while they were in the House.  Hosted by [[Gretel Killeen]].\n\n=== Final Sunday Double Eviction ===\n'''Final Sunday Double Eviction''' was the last [[Big Brother Australia#Eviction|''Eviction'']] of ''Big Brother 2006'', and was broadcast live in front of an audience on Day 99 (30 July 2006) from [[Dreamworld (Australian theme park)|Dreamworld]], and was hosted by [[Gretel Killeen]]. It was during this show that [[#Max|Max]] and [[#David|David]] were evicted. On Day 98, the Final Four each had a separate discussion with Gretel in the ''Revenge Room'', discussing their time in the house and what they may have regretted. During his eviction, David was nearly apparently attacked by a member of the crowd when he was making his walk through the auditorium to the Eviction stage.  A security guard tackled the man, who was later revealed to be a friend of David's, to the ground, and David walked around them.\n\n=== Finale ===\nThe season finale aired on Day 100 (31 July 2006) in which Jamie was announced the winner and Camilla the runner-up.\n\n==Controversy==\nThis season of Big Brother Australia proved to be highly controversial. ''[[Big Brother Australia#Uncut / Adults Only|Big Brother \u2013 Adults Only]]'' ended its run early after politicians warned Network Ten that its screening of the show could harm its push for media reforms.<ref name=\"Ten shuts Big Brother - Adults Only\"/><ref name=\"Big Brother in bigger bother\"/> An [[Big Brother Australia#2006 alleged sexual assault controversy|alleged sexual assault]] during which John (real name Michael Bric) held down Camilla Severi on her bed while Ashley (Michael Cox) [[Turkey slap|pushed his crotch into her face]] in the house on 1 July 2006 resulted in the ejection of the pair from the show. The incident sparked calls for the series to be investigated for possible breaches of broadcasting laws,<ref name=\"Big Brother in bigger bother\"/> and calls for the cancellation of the series by several commentators and politicians, including then [[Australian Prime Minister]] [[John Howard]] and [[List of Australian Opposition Leaders|opposition leader]] [[Kim Beazley]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,19673382-7582,00.html|title=Howard, Laws call for end to Brother|last=Meade|first=Amanda|date=4 July 2006|work=[[The Australian]]|access-date=4 July 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060704191404/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,19673382-7582,00.html|archive-date=4 July 2006|url-status=dead|last2=Sainsbury|first2=Michael}}</ref> The incident and in particular the Prime Minister's comments, were reported internationally, running on [[CNN]] and the [[BBC]]<ref name=\"No action likely on Big Brother\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theage.com.au/news/entertainment/no-action-likely-on-big-brother/2006/07/04/1151778937268.html|title=No action likely on Big Brother|last=Doherty|first=Ben|date=5 July 2006|work=[[The Age]]|access-date=5 July 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060705211845/http://www.theage.com.au/news/entertainment/no-action-likely-on-big-brother/2006/07/04/1151778937268.html|archive-date=5 July 2006|url-status=live|last2=Ziffer|first2=Daniel|location=Canberra}}</ref> and in various other international publications.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theage.com.au/news/tv--radio/big-bother-a-global-pandemic/2006/07/04/1151778921071.html|title='Big bother' a global pandemic|last=Toms|first=Janine|date=4 July 2006|work=[[The Age]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060706010915/http://www.theage.com.au/news/tv--radio/big-bother-a-global-pandemic/2006/07/04/1151778921071.html|archive-date=6 July 2006|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe incident sparked a high level of discussion on Internet forums where commentators were split over whether the incident was playful fun or actual assault.

The report concluded that loopholes in broadcasting rules should be closed, and Internet content regulations tightened. It was found that ''Big Brother'' itself could not be penalised as the footage was never broadcast by Network Ten but was seen only via web streaming, and the Internet falls outside ACMA's authority. Websites running the footage would not be penalised under other regulations governing web broadcasts as they had removed the footage when requested.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theage.com.au/news/tv--radio/coonan-flags-internet-crackdown/2006/07/05/1151778995801.html|title=Coonan flags internet crackdown|last=Burrow|first=Vanessa|date=5 July 2006|work=The Age|access-date=5 July 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060707004920/https://www.theage.com.au/news/tv--radio/coonan-flags-internet-crackdown/2006/07/05/1151778995801.html|archive-date=7 July 2006|url-status=live|publisher=Fairfax Media}}</ref> Rival network current affairs programs ''[[A Current Affair (Australian TV series)|A Current Affair]]'' on the [[Nine Network]], and the [[Seven Network]]'s ''[[Today Tonight]]'', both broadcast the footage in full.

The series began on 22 April 2006 and finished on 31 July 2006; a duration of 101 days. In the auditions, which had been held in November and December 2005, producers asked for contestants who were \"smart, strong, and looking for a fight\". The [[Big Brother (Australian TV series)#Opening Night|''Launch'']] was aired on the evening of 23 April 2006 (a 24-hour delay).  Fifteen housemates initially entered the house on Day 0, with the addition of three ''[[Big Brother (Australian TV series)#Intruders|Intruder]]'' housemates entering the Big Brother House in Week 4, another three Intruders in Week 9, and two replacement housemates entering in Week 12. On Day 100, [[List of Big Brother Australia housemates (2006 series)#Jamie|Jamie]] was declared the winner of ''Big Brother 2006'', with [[List of Big Brother Australia housemates (2006 series)#Camilla|Camilla]] the runner-up.<ref name=\"Jamie tells Katie 'I love you'\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/news/tv--radio/jamie-tells-katie-i-love-you/2006/08/01/1154198080424.html|title=Jamie tells Katie 'I love you'|date=1 August 2006|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|access-date=1 August 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016052056/http://www.smh.com.au/news/tv--radio/jamie-tells-katie-i-love-you/2006/08/01/1154198080424.html|archive-date=16 October 2007|url-status=live|publisher=Fairfax Media|agency=Australian Associated Press}}</ref> At the time it was the closest winning margin in any Australian series of the show, later beaten by Series 7 in 2007.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,19980247-2902,00.html|title=Jamie takes home the money|last=|first=|date=1 August 2006|work=[[Herald Sun]]|access-date=1 August 2006}}{{dead link|date=July 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Ratings==\nRatings for '''Big Brother 2006''' were up slightly on the previous year.

''Big Brother 2006'' added the ''save'' vote. Any viewer may cast as many ''evict'' or ''save'' votes as they choose. Prior to eviction each housemates' save votes were merged with their evict votes; the housemate with the highest number of evict votes \u2013 or lowest number of ''save'' votes \u2013 remaining after the merge is evicted.\n\n=== The House ===\nAs with some previous seasons of ''Big Brother'' Australia, a new house with an original layout was constructed for this series. A new feature was the addition of a ''Punishment Room'' to which rule-breaking housemates would be consigned by Big Brother.  Housemates in the ''Punishment Room'' were required to perform tedious, difficult, embarrassing, or mildly painful tasks and jobs, such as sorting white rice from brown rice, sanding a wooden cube into a sphere, or dancing around a [[sombrero]] for hours.\n\n=== Related housemates secret ===\nOne of the twists of ''Big Brother 2006'', promoted in advertising [[hyperbole]] as \"Australia's World First\", was that housemates [[#Karen|Karen]] and [[#Krystal|Krystal]] are mother and daughter. This was not revealed to the other housemates, who were challenged to uncover the secret relationship in the house. The other housemates failed to uncover their secret, and as a reward for success in keeping their secret Karen and Krystal were exempt from being [[Big Brother Australia#Nominations|nominated]] by other housemates in the first round. Karen was later evicted from the House on Day 22.\nIn [[Big Brother 5 (Australia)|''Big Brother 2005'']] a different related-housemates secret task was conducted. Twin brothers [[Greg Mathew|Greg]] and David Mathew were, one at a time, put in the House, and were told to swap places at given times without being noticed by other housemates.  They were given the mission to keep this a secret for the opportunity to be entered into the game as individual housemates each with the chance of winning ''Big Brother 2005''.\n\n=== Big Brother Uncut ===\n2006 saw the renaming of ''Big Brother Uncut'' to ''[[Big Brother Australia#Uncut / Adults Only|Big Brother: Adults Only]]''. Network Ten discontinued ''Adults Only'' early due to pressure from politicians, with the final episode broadcast on 19 June 2006.<ref name=\"Ten shuts Big Brother - Adults Only\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/story/0,20797,19563555-5003402,00.html|title=Ten shuts Big Brother - Adults Only|date=23 June 2006|work=[[The Courier-Mail]]|access-date=4 July 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060715233628/http://www.thecouriermail.news.com.au/story/0,20797,19563555-5003402,00.html|archive-date=15 July 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"Big Brother in bigger bother\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theage.com.au/articles/2006/07/02/1151778811490.html|title=Big Brother in bigger bother|last=Stafford|first=Annabel|date=3 July 2006|work=[[The Age]]|access-date=4 July 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060705010054/http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2006/07/02/1151778811490.html|archive-date=5 July 2006|url-status=live|location=Canberra}}</ref> The content that was to be used on unscreened episodes was made available on a new ''Big Brother Premium'' (paying members) section of the Big Brother website called Adults Only.  {{clear|right}}\n\n== Housemates ==\n{{main|List of Big Brother (Australian TV series) season 6 housemates}}\nFifteen '''''Big Brother 2006 housemates''''' entered at the beginning of the season.

The two Housemates with the most Nomination Points would be given a fake Eviction and moved into the Revenge Room, where they would be able to watch their fellow Housemates, see who Nominated them, and enact their revenge without their fellow Housemates knowing. Anna and Camilla received the most Nomination Points and were moved into the Revenge Room, where they remained for forty-eight hours.\n* {{note|2|Note 2}}: Anna and Camilla were in the Revenge Room during this Week's Nominations and could not Nominate, nor be Nominated. Because Michael failed his Insider task to expose the relationship between Karen and Krystal he automatically faced the Public Vote. This Week Karen and Krystal Nominated as a single entity, represented by Karen.\n* {{note|3|Note 3}}: Michael was [[Immunity (reality television)|immune]] from Nominations after he passed his Insider Mission. Karen and Krystal Nominated as one entity represented by Krystal.\n* {{note|4|Note 4}}: Michael was set an Insider Mission to be Nominated by at least eight Housemates \u2013 and as nine Housemates Nominated him he passed and was Immune from Nomination this Week.\n* {{note|5|Note 5}}: Michael's Insider position was relinquished, and taken over by Jade, therefore Michael's eligibility for Nomination no longer rested upon Insider Missions. New Housemates Danielle, Jade and Rob were Exempt from the Nomination process in their first Week in the House. Michael and Katie were each awarded an extra point by Big Brother for giving poor Nomination reasons.\n* {{note|6|Note 6}}: After Nominations, which saw Camilla, Dino, Jade and Krystal Nominated, for Danielle to save Krystal using the three point twist \u2013 reducing the line-up to Camilla, Dino and Jade. After Nominations Big Brother Nominated five other Housemates considered to be operating \"under the radar\" \u2013 deliberately staying quiet and avoiding controversy so as not to be Nominated. The five Nominated were Ashley, Claire, Gaelan, John and Krystal, and the Public were allowed to vote for two more to be added to the Nomination line-up. The Public chose Krystal (31%) and John (30%) to be added to the Nomination line-up. Therefore, Camilla, Dino, Jade, John and Krystal would face the Public Vote this Week, which would be a Double Eviction.\n* {{note|7|Note 7}}: Big Brother awarded Ashley and Katie one extra point each for not giving valid Nomination reasons.\n* {{note|8|Note 8}}: Shortly before Rob's Eviction Housemates had to choose which of the three new Intruders (Darren, Lauren and Perry) would leave. Housemates named one Intruder they would like to Evict (top of Nomination Box) and one they would like to save (bottom of Nomination Box). When the Intruder's save votes were deducted from their evict votes Lauren had the highest score (with one Eviction Point) and was Evicted shortly before Rob. None of the Intruders could Nominate in the Intruder Vote.\n* {{note|9|Note 9}}: New Housemates Darren and Perry were Exempt from the Nomination process. Big Brother added one point to John, after he failed to give adequate reasons for Nominating. Jamie was banned from Nominating for previously discussing Nominations.\n* {{note|10|Note 10}}: Big Brother awarded one point to both Claire and Perry for giving inadequate Nomination reasons.\n* {{note|11|Note 11}}: Week 14 was the final week. Chris was evicted on Day 95, with Max and David following on Day 99. For the next 24 hours, the public were voting for a winner, either Camilla or Jamie.\n</small>\n\n==Weekly summary and highlights==\n\n===Week 1===\n(up to and including Sunday night)\n* Michael McCoy was the first to enter the house, followed by Camilla Severi.\n* Soon after entering the House, housemate Michael McCoy was issued with, and accepted, the challenge by Big Brother to act as a secret saboteur in the House, known officially as the Insider.  He was to play specific pranks at Big Brother's command, to work against and annoy other housemates, and to attempt to stymie the housemates' attempts to successfully complete assigned compulsory tasks.  He had to remain undetected in these strategies and keep his role as the Insider a secret, or be automatically nominated for eviction.\n* Michael McCoy failed his first mission within minutes of receiving it, and received his first strike because of it.\n* Through his diary room discussions with Big Brother, viewers learned that David is gay but had not disclosed this to his fellow housemates. David [[coming out|came out]] to them on Wednesday, 26 April 2006.\n* Gaelan won the first [[Big Brother (Australia)#Friday Night Live|''Big Brother Friday Night Live 2006'']], and chose runner-up Katie as his partner in the ''Rewards Room''. The theme was Cavemen.\n* A new twist was revealed to the Housemates; a fourth prize would be awarded to the winner of ''Friday Night Live''. Three sealed boxes would be presented to the winner, marked 1, 2 and 3. The winner would select one box only before being allowed to open the box of their choice. The three boxes would inevitably contain a major prize (an overseas holiday), a medium-sized prize, and a booby prize. The three prizes would follow a theme or be associated with each other in a homonymous manner (e.g. ''Cam''bodia, ''cam''era, ''Cam''embert).\n* The three boxes were presented to Gaelan. They contained a trip to Thailand, a Thai banquet for all of the Housemates for the following night, and a large red bow tie. Gaelan chose the box containing the novelty bow tie.\n* Krystal revealed to the house that Karen was her mother.\n* On Day 8, Big Brother asked housemates to nominate which two they found 'Most Annoying'.  The two who had the highest nominations were Anna and Camilla.  They were both evicted from the house but unknown to the remaining housemates never left the compound and were sent to the Revenge Room. From there they could view the activities in the house and were given a task to enact revenge on their housemates for nominating them.\n* Prize money at the end of Week 1 was $820,000.\n\n===Week 2===\n* Monday, 1 May saw the first official nominations of series 6. Elise, Tilli, Claire, and Dino were nominated. Michael was also up for nomination after failing his Insider task.\n* On 2 May, the two isolated Housemates, Anna and Camilla, were returned to the House in [[#Revenge Room Return|''Revenge Room Return'']].  Both were immune to nomination points received during [[#Week 3|Week 3]]'s [[Big Brother Australia#Nominations|''Nominations'']].\n* Dino wins the second ''Friday Night Live'' and takes runner-up Claire to the Rewards Room. The theme for the night is the Farmyard. The three boxes contain a trip to Cambodia, a digital camera, and some Camembert cheese. Dino chooses the box containing the Camembert cheese.\n* Tilli and Elise were evicted in a double eviction on 7 May.\n* Prize money at the end of Week 2 was $665,000.\n\n===Week 3===\n* Michael McCoy surviving eviction in week two became a controversial character within the House\n* Karen, Krystal and Camilla were nominated.\n* Michael McCoy's 'Insider challenge' for the week was to ensure that he was nominated by eight Housemates in the next week's nominations.  Success would mean immunity from eviction for the week.  He spun a complex and fictitious tale of a son called Reuben and a paternity test supposedly taken shortly before he entered the House that revealed he was not (as he had believed for nearly nine years) Reuben's biological father, in a bid to make other Housemates think he wanted to leave the house.\n* Michael McCoy won ''Friday Night Live'', choosing Ashley to join him in the Rewards Room. The theme for the night was Back To Work (an office theme). The three boxes contained a trip to China, complimentary Chinese laundry services for three Housemates for the week, and a Chinese fortune cookie. Michael McCoy chose the box containing the laundry services.\n* Housemates held a mock wedding for Jamie and Katie.\n* Michael McCoy's deception began tearing the house apart as Housemates did not know what to believe\n* Karen was evicted on 14 May.\n* Prize money at the end of Week 3 was $610,000.\n\n===Week 4===\n* Michael succeeded in his Insider task to get eight housemates to nominate him and therefore was safe from eviction. Michael used his ''Three Point Twist'' to save Dino from eviction. Camilla, Ashley, Anna, David, and Krystal were up for eviction.\n* Michael's 'Insider' role was revealed to the house by Big Brother. Many housemates felt that Michael had betrayed them.\n* All three Intruders, Rob, Jade, and Danielle, went into the house at different times during the night during Day 24.\n* Michael and David nearly shared a kiss in the bathroom. It was later revealed by Michael on [[Rove (TV series)|Rove Live]], and also during \"The Gretel Incident\" that it was a joke.\n* Gaelan won the rockstar-themed [[Big Brother Australia#Friday Night Live|''Friday Night Live'']], his second ''Friday Night Live'' win.  He invited Krystal to the ''Rewards Room''. They received a special prize: a dinner at Tiger Island (situated inside [[Dreamworld (Australian theme park)|Dreamworld]], but outside the Big Brother House). This prize was hailed as another of [[Big Brother (Australia)|''Big Brother Australia'']]'s \"''World First''\"s, due to the notion that these two Housemates left the confines of the House as part of the game, and were returned an hour later.\n* Anna was evicted on 21 May.\n* Jade was voted as the new Insider by the public and was notified that night.\n* Prize money at the end of Week 4 was $545,000.\n\n===Week 5===\n* Originally, Michael McCoy, Camilla, and David were nominated. Because he won ''Friday Night Live'', Gaelan used his ''Three Point Twist'' on David, changing the final eviction line-up to Michael McCoy, Camilla, and John.\n* Katie gives Dino the challenge of having to remain within 5 metres of Camilla for half the day in exchange for Katie's bread rations. When Camilla found Dino spending most of the day with her she thought he might have been interested in her.\n* Katie celebrated her 20th birthday on 23 May. Big Brother threw a surprise birthday party for her in the Rewards Room. The party had a Hawaiian beach theme where all the housemates dressed in Hawaiian costumes. Dino and Intruder Danielle pash at Katie's party. Camilla was upset because she thought Dino was interested in her.\n* Jade's first Insider mission was on 23 May, where she was only allowed to sing and not speak in her usual manner from sunrise to sunset. She spent the day in silence in an effort to complete her task, only having to resort to singing on a few occasions.\n* On 24 May, Michael McCoy stole a number of Housemates' toothbrushes and hid them in a sock under a bed in an effort to create conflict and entertainment within the House. The housemates never found the toothbrushes despite Big Brother showing the housemates where they were located. Michael McCoy never admitted he was the culprit. Michael did all of this of his own accord, having been relieved of his Insider role the previous week.\n* Intruder Danielle won ''Friday Night Live'', and chose John to join her in the Rewards Room. The theme for the night was Horror Night. The three boxes contained a trip to South Africa, a motor scooter, and a salad sandwich. Danielle chose the box containing the sandwich.\n* Michael McCoy was evicted from the House on 28 May. His farewell message implicated another housemate in the theft of the toothbrushes\n* Prize money at the end of Week 5 was $500,000.\n\n===Week 6===\n* Big Brother played the video of Michael Mccoy stealing the toothbrushes before nomination.\n* Originally in general nominations, Jade, Dino, Camilla, and Krystal were nominated. Because Danielle won the Friday Night Games, Danielle used her ''Three Point Twist'' on Krystal, removed Krystal from the list of nominees.\n* [[#Under the Radar|''Under the Radar'']] nominations took place on Day 38 (29 May). This allowed the public to nominate a housemate on the basis of whether they have been using the \"under the radar\" strategy. Big Brother chose Krystal, John, Gaelan, Clare, Ashley as the ''\"Under the Radar\"'' candidates and viewer votes resulted in Krystal and John being added to nominations.\n* During the Nominations show, evicted housemate Michael McCoy and host Gretel Killeen have a heated interview about whether ''Big Brother'' used editing techniques to misconstrue an incident where Michael appeared to express a desire to kiss David. Killeen strongly defended the series, insisting that misleading editing techniques are not used. McCoy claims the kissing incident was a joke but that by cutting the shot too soon, it appeared in the footage as broadcast to be serious.  Killeen clearly appeared uneasy and ambivalent about defending the actions of the ''Big Brother'' program when later in the ''[[Big Brother (Australia)#Nominations|Nominations]]'' show, she apologised to Michael McCoy and the 'full' footage is shown. This includes only a few seconds extra of footage, albeit from a different angle, in which it appears the move by David and Michael to kiss each other may have been a joke.\n* Katie was the winner of ''Friday Night Live'', and choose Jamie to join her in the rewards room. The theme was [[Caribbean]]. The prizes in the three boxes were a dreadlock, a motor scooter, and a $1000 JeansWest gift voucher. Katie selected the box with the motor scooter. (She was the first housemate to pick the best prize in this series)\n* Jade succeeded in her Insider task which gave her a one-week immunity from nominations in the next week if she survived eviction on 3 June.\n* Jade and Dino were evicted on Day 43, 4 June.\n* Prize money at the end of Week 6 was $470,000.\n\n===Week 7===\n* Rob, Danielle, and Camilla were nominated for eviction. Katie used her 3-point twist from winning ''Friday Night Live'' to remove points from Camilla \u2013 even though she nominated her herself \u2013 and this did not affect the nominations.\n* Danielle's 19th birthday was on Day 47 (8 June 2006).  A Horror-themed birthday party, themed by the housemates' current task, took place.  During the party Danielle incurred a $5000 fine and was sent to the Punishment Room to clean dirty dentures after speaking without her microphone.\n* David won a [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] themed ''[[Big Brother Australia#Friday Night Live|Friday Night Live]]'' and takes Camilla to the Rewards Room.  The ''Three Boxes'' contained a Vietnam trekking holiday, an Xbox 360, and a photo of the ex-housemates. David picked the box containing the holiday.\n* Danielle was evicted on Day 50, 11 June.\n* Prize money at the end of Week 7 was $390,000.\n\n===Week 8===\n* Ashley, David, Jamie, and Katie were nominated for eviction.  David used his ''Three Point Twist'' on Ashley, changing the eviction line-up to David, Jamie, and Katie. This was the first week Camilla had not been nominated where she was eligible to be nominated.\n* Jamie, Katie and John each received a strike for discussing nominations.\n* John won \"[[Alternative words for British#Pommy|Pommy]] Night\", a British-themed [[Big Brother Australia#Friday Night Live|''Friday Night Live'']] and took [[#Claire|Claire]] into the Rewards Room with him.  The three boxes contained a [[digital camera]], a [[mug]], and a trip to Africa.  He picked Box 3, and won a digital camera.\n* Claire celebrated her 23rd birthday on 17 June, and had an animal-themed birthday party where the housemates had to dress up in animal costumes.\n* Katie was evicted on Day 57, 18 June.\n* Prize money at the end of Week 8 was $375,000.\n\n===Week 9===\n* Camilla, Jamie, and Rob were nominated for eviction.  John used his ''Three Point Twist'' on Jamie, but it did not change the final lineup of nominations.\n* John was given a strike and banned from ''Friday Night Live'' for discussing nominations and alluding to whom he removed points from as part of the ''Three Point Twist''. Jamie was given a warning for the same discussion.\n* Three more Intruders ([[#Perry|Perry]], [[#Darren|Darren]], and [[#Lauren|Lauren]]) entered the house on 21 June's (Day 60) [[#Intruders \u2013 Incoming|''Intruders \u2013 Incoming'']] show.\n* Two federal government backbenchers complained about ''[[Big Brother Australia#Uncut / Adults Only|Big Brother \u2013 Adults Only]]'', despite the show been extremely toned down this year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/tv--radio/big-brother-in-hot-water-again/2006/06/20/1150701537694.html|title=Big Brother in hot water again|date=20 June 2006|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|access-date=21 June 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021194218/http://www.smh.com.au/news/tv--radio/big-brother-in-hot-water-again/2006/06/20/1150701537694.html|archive-date=21 October 2007|url-status=live|publisher=Fairfax Media|agency=Australian Associated Press}}</ref>\n* Network Ten crumbles to the pressure of these conservative MPs and pulls ''Adults Only'' from air early, announcing on 23 June 2006 that the program had \"completed its season run\".<ref name=\"Ten shuts Big Brother - Adults Only\"/>\n* Day 62's [[Big Brother Australia#Friday Night Live|''Friday Night Live'']] was themed \"Bugs Night\". and  all of the games were bug related.  Claire won the Friday Night Games, defeating Gaelan in the final round. After inviting Rob to join her in the ''Rewards Room'', she won a trip to China from the three boxes.\n* [[#Krystal|Krystal]] was injured during Day 62's Friday Night Games, and had to leave the Friday Night Live arena.  She was treated by a doctor in the [[#House|''Spare Room'']], receiving nine stitches under her chin. She was also unable to compete in the following week's FNL.\n* [[#Lauren|Lauren]] was evicted on Day 64 in a Housemates' vote where they had to decide which of the new Intruders they wanted to see go.\n* [[#Rob|Rob]] was evicted on Day 64.\n* Prize money at the end of Week 9 was $325,000.\n\n=== Week 10 ===\n* David, Gaelan, and Krystal were nominated for eviction.

The ''Three Boxes'' contained a trip to Thailand, an [[Xbox 360]], and a pair of chopsticks. David chose the Thailand holiday, winning him a second holiday.\n* On Day 70 (1 July 2006), Ashley allegedly slapped his genitals in Camilla's face while John held her down, at approximately 04:30; Ashley and John were escorted from the house by security later that day. As a result, the ''Big Brother'' forum on the official website was taken offline until further notice after fans flooded the forum with posts discussing the incident. This was the first time the forum had been taken offline since the \"Belindagate\" incident of [[Big Brother Australia 2003|''Big Brother 2003'']]. ''Behind Big Brother Australia'' reported that the reason was for sexual harassment towards Camilla.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.behindbigbrother.com/showarticle.php?articleID=934|title=Ash, John sexually assault Camilla and are escorted from the house|date=1 July 2006|website=Behind Big Brother Australia|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060705060832/http://www.behindbigbrother.com/showarticle.php?articleID=934|archivedate=5 July 2006|url-status=dead|df=dmy}}</ref> While the housemates were made aware of this, the live feeds were cut, and in their place was an old [[Big Brother Australia#UpLate|''UpLate'']] ''Update'' of the housemates doing their Football task on a continuous loop.

Darren chose box three, revealed to contain the Swiss army gadget.\n* Shortly after Perry's eviction on Sunday, 9 July 2006, [[Gretel Killeen]] announced during the eviction show that, unbeknown to the current housemates, two new male housemates would be entering the house as replacements for Ashley and John.\n* Prize money at the end of Week 11 stood at $265,000.\n\n===Week 12===\n* Darren, David, and Camilla were nominated for eviction. Darren used his ''Three Point Twist'' on himself.

Max entered during the special one-hour show [[#The New Housemates|''The New Housemates'']], where he posed as Darren in a pirate costume, quickly being identified. Chris, was held in the ''revenge room'', and entered the House live on [[Rove (TV series)|Rove]].\n* Krystal's 20th Birthday was on Day 81 (12 July 2006).  She had a Hollywood-themed party.\n* On Day 82, Camilla received a $5,000 fine for referring to Big Brother by another name.

This successfully removed Jamie from the line up, and resulted in David and Camilla joining the line up of housemates up for eviction.\n* A surprise eviction was held on Wednesday, 26 July (Day 95) in which Chris was evicted with 69% of the merged vote.\n* After Chris's eviction Big Brother announced to the remaining four housemates that they are all nominated for eviction.\n* During the Surprise Eviction show host Gretel Killeen announced that the next eviction will be on Sunday night, and it will be a double eviction.\n* [[Network Ten]] advertised [[#The Prize Fight|''The Prize Fight'']], a special [[Big Brother Australia#Friday Night Live|''Friday Night Live'']], to take place on Day 97, in which the remaining housemates would have the chance to reclaim some of their lost prize money. Housemates were put to the test through a range of obstacles, varying in difficulty and value. Because of their efforts, the final four managed to secure an additional $311,000. This brought the prize money to $511,000.\n* At the conclusion of [[#The Prize Fight|''The Prize Fight'']], Big Brother announced that the final housemate standing would win the prize money, less all fines they had accumulated during their time in the house. This means that out of $511,000 in prize money, Camilla could have won $406,000; David could have won $446,000; Jamie could have won $426,000, and did; and Max could have won $496,000.\n* On Day 98, one housemate was invited into the ''Diary Room''. Camilla entered, and received a celebratory reception as she was informed she was the 1500th visitor to the Big Brother diary room. She was then told that she, and three friends in the house, would later that day dine with Big Brother. While the housemates had their meal with Big Brother, they were oblivious to the fact that one of each had a loved one in the house, leaving a gift for them. Max's mother cooked his favourite meal and left it simmering on the stove, David's mother left his saddle and boots for him in the bedroom, Camilla's friend left her some clothes and personal possessions, and Jamie's mother left him a clean pair of fisherman pants, a new headband and a much-needed belt.\n* Max, and soon after, David, were evicted on Day 99 in [[#Final Sunday Eviction|''Final Sunday Eviction'']].  David was the first housemate to be evicted despite his save votes outnumbering his evict votes; in this nomination Max was the only housemate to have a greater number of evict votes than save votes.\n* Disqualified housemates John and Ashley were excluded from participating in the 2006 [[Big Brother Australia#Finale|''Finale'']]; all other former ''Big Brother 2006'' housemates appeared in the show.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,19939236-5001026,00.html|title=Final insult|last=|first=|date=2006-07-29|work=The Daily Telegraph|access-date=2006-08-01|url-status=dead}}{{Dead link|date=May 2018}}</ref>\n* While inside the house, [[#Jamie|Jamie]] was announced winner of ''Big Brother 2006'', while [[#Camilla|Camilla]] was runner-up.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/articles/2006/07/31/1154198079738.html|title=Turkey-slapped then robbed|last=Moses|first=Alexa|date=1 August 2006|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|access-date=1 August 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070329040650/http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2006/07/31/1154198079738.html|archive-date=29 March 2007|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2006/07/31/1154198078725.html|title=Big Brother contestant saw a winner in the mirror|last=Edwards|first=Lorna|date=1 August 2006|work=[[The Age]]|access-date=1 August 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022065348/http://theage.com.au/articles/2006/07/31/1154198078725.html|archive-date=22 October 2007|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==House==\nThe ''Big Brother 2006'' House had the following areas and facilities:\n[[File:BB06-Houseplan.SVG|450px|thumb|Floorplan of the ''Big Brother'' House as designed in 2006]]\n* Kitchen\n* Lounge\n* Dining Room\n* Bedroom (split by a dividing wall)\n* Bathroom\n* Sauna\n* Yard\n* Pool\n* Gym\n* Spa\n* Rewards Room\n* Animal enclosure\n* Shop\n* Friday Night Live Arena\n* Air lock, Diary Room, and Eviction exit\n* Punishment Room\n* Spare room, which has been used as the ''Revenge Room'' and the ''Exit Room''\n\n== Fines ==\n{{main|Big Brother (Australia)#Fines}}\nThe Prize Fund at the beginning of ''Big Brother 2006'' was [[Australian dollar|A$]]1,000,000, however following on from [[Big Brother Australia 2005|''Big Brother 2005'']], the housemates were fined $5000 a time for committing various offences.  In Big Brother 2006, the housemates were not allowed any grace period that ''Big Brother 2005'' housemates experienced, and fines were awarded within minutes of all the housemates entering the House on launch night.  Following the first week, the ''Punishment Room'' was revealed, where housemates were often sent after receiving their $5,000 fine from Big Brother. \nHousemates were also repeatedly warned that once a fine has been incurred, that money could never be regained. After final four housemates added '''$311,000''' back to the remaining '''$200,000''' prize money taking it to '''$511,000''' during the last Friday Night Games they were told that whoever wins Big Brother 2006 will have their fines deducted from the prize money. \nThe fine tallies of the lowest and highest were from Lauren Clayton who received no fines and Camilla Severi who clocked up '''$105,000'''.\n\n== Special shows ==\n\n=== The Insider AKA Michael McCoy ===\n'''The Insider''' was a live show, broadcast on Day 2, where the result of the Insider public vote was revealed. Viewers had to vote for whether David, Camilla, or Michael should be appointed the Insider. The [[Big Brother Australia#Daily Show|''Daily Show'']] was broadcast as part of ''The Insider''.  Hosted by [[Gretel Killeen]]. Michael McCoy was selected as the insider Michael McCoy (born 16 June 1980) is a political science student from Sydney, New South Wales. He is of Anglo-Celtic and Filipino descent. Michael was the first housemate to enter the Big Brother House this year.\nOn Day 2, he was given the task of the Insider by Big Brother, having been chosen by the viewing public. If he succeeded in his tasks, he would be immune from being nominated, but if he failed he would automatically be put up for eviction.\n\nHe failed his first mission within minutes of being assigned the task, which was to secretly spill water on a bed that was occupied by two housemates. Michael opted to spill water on Gaelan's bed, which at the time was only used by Gaelan himself. Because of that, and because he also didn't empty the whole bottle, he was awarded his first strike. Soon after, he was given other missions, one of which was to be nominated by at least eight of his fellow housemates in the next round of nominations. To complete this mission he fabricated a story about a custody issue concerning his young son Reuben, claiming he wanted to leave the house to concentrate on this issue.\n\nAfter Big Brother revealed to the other housemates that Michael was the Insider, and that the Reuben story was pure fiction, Michael faced a strong backlash from several housemates angry at being duped in this way, especially from Anna who had little contact with her father. It was revealed on Michael's eviction night that Reuben is the name of one of Michael's real life friends. Despite no longer being the Insider, Michael continued to cause conflict in Week 5, hiding cutlery as well as hiding the housemates' toothbrushes from them, never revealing their locations even after he had been evicted, attempting to create doubts as to whether or not there is another insider inside the house besides Michael. He was the 5th housemate to be evicted from the house on Day 36, with 20% of the merged vote.\n\nThe day after he was evicted, Michael appeared on the Nominations show and had a heated discussion with Gretel Killeen about the producers' editing regarding a scene where Michael and housemate David appeared to be kissing. The outfall resulted in media attention and the interview with Gretel was later labelled \"The Gretel Incident\" by fans due to Gretel's hostile interviewing tactics during the scene. The day after this incident Michael appeared on Rove Live and when host Rove McManus insulted Michael, the former housemate returned fire by bluntly telling Rove he wasn't as funny as the show's co-host Peter Helliar.\n\nWhen asked about \"The Gretel Incident\", Michael suggested that Friday Night Live and Big Brother UpLate host Mike Goldman, or Friday Night Live co-host and former housemate Ryan Fitzgerald, would be better hosts of Big Brother than Gretel Killeen. As has become custom over the history of the show, Michael appeared along with all the other 2006 housemates on the Rove Live episode of the week of the final. In his usual style he said what everyone wanted to say but were too afraid to. As soon as he was asked to speak, he immediately questioned why John and Ashley were not present, and attempted to get the host to bring them on.\n\n=== Surprise Eviction ===\n'''Surprise Eviction''' was a live show that was broadcast on the first Sunday (Day 8) following [[Big Brother Australia#Launch|''Launch'']], where the housemates each had to vote for two of the housemates that they wanted to see evicted.  Kept hidden from them was the fact that the two housemates with the most votes, [[#Anna|Anna]] and [[#Camilla|Camilla]], were not evicted; but were sent to the ''Revenge Room'' to secretly cause havoc on the house.  Hosted by [[Gretel Killeen]].\n\n=== Unforgettable ===\n'''Unforgettable''' was a special live show aired on Day 9. Hosted by Gretel Killeen.\n\n=== Revenge Room Return ===\n'''Revenge Room Return''' was a special live show aired on Day 10, two days after Anna and Camilla were evicted to the Revenge Room in [[#Special Eviction|''Special Eviction'']].  The  one-hour episode incorporated the [[Big Brother Australia#Daily Show|Daily Show]]. It ended with [[#Anna|Anna]] and [[#Camilla|Camilla]] re-entering the house as [[#John|John]]'s special birthday gift.  Hosted by [[Gretel Killeen]].\n\n===Intruders Go In===\n'''Intruders Go In''' was a live special held on Day 24 (16 May 2006), when housemates [[#Rob|Rob]], [[#Danielle|Danielle]] and [[#Jade|Jade]] were revealed and entered the House as [[Big Brother Australia#Intruders|Intruders]] throughout the night. Footage of Michael being revealed as the Insider to the housemates was also shown, including the reaction of the housemates. Rob entered first towards the end of the special. Jade entered the house shortly before ''[[Rove (TV series)|Rove Live]]'', and Danielle entered during [[Big Brother Australia#UpLate|''UpLate'']].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bigbrother.3mobile.com.au/news/article_154.asp|title=Intruders have landed!|website=Big Brother official site|publisher=[[Endemol Southern Star]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060521235735/http://bigbrother.3mobile.com.au/news/article_154.asp|archive-date=21 May 2006|url-status=dead|access-date=26 June 2006}}</ref>\n\n=== Truth, Lies, Eviction ===\n'''Truth, Lies, Eviction''' was a live show used on Day 36.  Big Brother felt that some housemates were lying or holding back on things about themselves, therefore flying [[#Under the Radar|''Under the Radar'']].  On Day 35, each housemate went into the diary room and was asked some questions.  A lie-risk detector, said to be 90% accurate, was used to determine from the frequency of their voice whether or not they were lying.  They weren't informed that a lie detector was used, or what the information would be used for until during ''Truth, Lies, Eviction'' was broadcast.  The show also featured [[#Michael|Michael]]'s eviction, and the [[Big Brother Australia#Daily Show|Daily Show]] was broadcast as part of ''Truth, Lies, Eviction''.\n\n=== Under the Radar ===\n'''Under the Radar''' was a show that aired during Day 38.  Based on the results of Day 36's [[#Truth, Lies, Eviction|''Truth, Lies, Eviction'']] show, Big Brother selected five housemates that he felt weren't contributing to the house, who were intentionally acting in a reserved manner to avoid conflict and thereby avoid being nominated, or flying ''Under the Radar''. These housemates were up for a 24-hour public vote to decide which of them would be added to the list of housemates up for eviction that week. The public vote started on Day 37's ''[[Big Brother Australia#Nominations|Nominations]]'' show.  The housemates Big Brother felt were \"flying under the radar\" were Ashley, Claire, Gaelan, John, and Krystal. Based on viewer votes John and Krystal were added to the list of housemates up for eviction. On [[Big Brother Australia#Eviction|''Eviction'']] night, neither of them were evicted.\n\n=== Intruders \u2013 Incoming ===\n'''Intruders \u2013 Incoming''' was a live show that was broadcast on Day 60 (21 June 2006).  In the show, new Intruders [[#Darren|Darren]], and [[#Perry|Perry]] entered the house.  [[#Lauren|Lauren]] entered the House later, in [[Big Brother Australia#UpLate|''UpLate'']].  The [[Big Brother Australia#Daily Show|Daily Show]] was broadcast as part of ''Intruders \u2013 Incoming''.  The show was hosted by [[Gretel Killeen]].\n\n===Housemates on Trial===\n'''Housemates on Trial''' was a live show that aired on Day 67 (28 June 2006). This special replaced a previously advertised special where housemates were to be hypnotised by hypnotist, Peter Powers,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bigbrother.3mobile.com.au/news/article_336.asp|title=Housemates on Trial|date=26 June 2006|website=Big Brother official site|publisher=[[Endemol Southern Star]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060627184253/http://bigbrother.3mobile.com.au/news/article_336.asp|archive-date=27 June 2006|url-status=dead|access-date=28 June 2006}}</ref> because not enough housemates consented to being hypnotised for enough footage to be produced for a special.  In this special, Housemates were asked a series of questions previously submitted by viewers and were run through a Layered Voice Analysis device to determine how honest the housemates were with their answers. This device did not require housemates to give yes or no answers. This special ran in a similar format to the previous special ''[[#Truth, Lies, Eviction|Truth, Lies, Eviction]]'', except without an Eviction. The show was hosted by [[Gretel Killeen]].\n\n=== The New Housemates ===\n'''The New Housemates''' was a live show aired on Day 80 (11 July 2006), where new housemates [[#Max|Max]] and [[#Chris|Chris]], both from [[New South Wales]], entered the house to replace [[#Ashley|Ashley]] and [[#John|John]].  Unlike Intruders, Chris and Max could nominate and be nominated immediately (the next opportunity to nominate would be six days later).  Max entered during the special one-hour show, where he posed as Darren in a pirate costume, quickly being identified. Chris entered live during [[Rove (TV series)|''Rove'']].  The ''[[Big Brother Australia#Daily Show|Daily Show]]'' was broadcast as part of ''The New Housemates''.\n\n=== Surprise Eviction ===\n'''Surprise Eviction''' was a live show on Day 95 (26 July 2006). The show was hosted by [[Gretel Killeen]].\n\n=== The Prize Fight ===\n'''The Prize Fight''' was a special [[Big Brother Australia#Friday Night Live|''Friday Night Live'']] that was broadcast on Day 97 (28 July 2006).  This was the last ''Friday Night Live'' of ''Big Brother 2006''.  The housemates were told by Big Brother that there would be no ''Rewards Room'', ''Three Boxes'', or ''Three Point Twist'' to compete for; and no chores to allocate; but would instead be given the opportunity to win any amount up to $416,000 to add to the prize fund of $200,000, depending on what percentage of the games they successfully completed.  [[Ryan Fitzgerald]], co-host of ''Friday Night Live'', was involved in one of the games, as an \"Ex-Professional Football Player\".  At the end of the games, the housemates were told that they added $311,000 to the prize fund, giving the winner the opportunity to win $511,000, less all the fines the winning housemate had incurred during their stay in the ''Big Brother'' House as they were all repeatedly warned that their fine money could never be regained.\n* While in the house, [[#Max|Max]] received fines totaling $15,000.  If Max won ''Big Brother 2006'', he would have received $496,000.\n* While in the house, [[#David|David]] received fines totaling $65,000. If David won ''Big Brother 2006'', he would have received $446,000.\n* While in the house, [[#Jamie|Jamie]] received fines totaling $85,000; and he received $426,000 as winner of ''Big Brother 2006''.\n* While in the house, [[#Camilla|Camilla]] received fines totaling $105,000; more than any other housemate in Big Brother history.  Therefore, if Camilla had won ''Big Brother 2006'', she would have received $406,000.\n\n=== Surprise Visit ===\n'''Surprise Visit''' was the last [[Big Brother Australia#Daily Show|''Daily Show'']] of ''Big Brother 2006'', and was broadcast on Day 99 (30 July 2006).  Camilla won a date with Big Brother as she had been the 1500th Housemate to use the ''Diary Room'', and was able to take three of her closest friends, this being all of the other housemates in the House with her at the time.  While they were in the ''Diary Room'' on their date, David's, Jamie's, and Max's mothers; and Camilla's best friend, had entered the House to cook food and leave items that the housemates would recognise.  After their departure, the housemates were allowed back into the House to watch a video message of their loved ones while they were in the House.  Hosted by [[Gretel Killeen]].\n\n=== Final Sunday Double Eviction ===\n'''Final Sunday Double Eviction''' was the last [[Big Brother Australia#Eviction|''Eviction'']] of ''Big Brother 2006'', and was broadcast live in front of an audience on Day 99 (30 July 2006) from [[Dreamworld (Australian theme park)|Dreamworld]], and was hosted by [[Gretel Killeen]]. It was during this show that [[#Max|Max]] and [[#David|David]] were evicted. On Day 98, the Final Four each had a separate discussion with Gretel in the ''Revenge Room'', discussing their time in the house and what they may have regretted. During his eviction, David was nearly apparently attacked by a member of the crowd when he was making his walk through the auditorium to the Eviction stage.

The report concluded that loopholes in broadcasting rules should be closed, and Internet content regulations tightened. It was found that ''Big Brother'' itself could not be penalised as the footage was never broadcast by Network Ten but was seen only via web streaming, and the Internet falls outside ACMA's authority. Websites running the footage would not be penalised under other regulations governing web broadcasts as they had removed the footage when requested.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theage.com.au/news/tv--radio/coonan-flags-internet-crackdown/2006/07/05/1151778995801.html|title=Coonan flags internet crackdown|last=Burrow|first=Vanessa|date=5 July 2006|work=The Age|access-date=5 July 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060707004920/https://www.theage.com.au/news/tv--radio/coonan-flags-internet-crackdown/2006/07/05/1151778995801.html|archive-date=7 July 2006|url-status=live|publisher=Fairfax Media}}</ref> Rival network current affairs programs ''[[A Current Affair (Australian TV series)|A Current Affair]]'' on the [[Nine Network]], and the [[Seven Network]]'s ''[[Today Tonight]]'', both broadcast the footage in full.
