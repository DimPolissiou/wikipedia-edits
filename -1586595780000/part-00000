The Ugandans met light resistance and in November President [[Idi Amin]] of Uganda announced the annexation of all Tanzanian land north of the [[Kagera River]]. The Tanzanians organised a [[counter-offensive]] later in November and successfully ejected the Ugandan forces from their country.\n\nRelations between Tanzania and Uganda had been tense since then-Colonel Amin overthrew Ugandan President [[Milton Obote]] in 1971. Tanzanian President [[Julius Nyerere]] supported Obote and backed an unsuccessful attempt by him to regain power in 1972. Uganda also disputed its border with Tanzania, claiming that the Kagera Salient\u2014a {{convert|1865|km2}} stretch of land between the official border and the Kagera River {{convert|29|km}} to the south\u2014should be ceded to Uganda. Tensions remained high through 1978, when Amin's regime started rapidly declining due to economic problems and dissent in the armed forces. In early October Ugandan forces began making small incursions into the Kagera region. On 25 October the [[Uganda Army (1971\u20131980)|Uganda Army]] launched a large attack over the border, but was repulsed by Tanzanian artillery. The Ugandans attacked again on 30 October, quickly overwhelming the small Tanzanian contingent in the region and completely occupying the Kagera Salient. Amin declared that Uganda was annexing the region, and shortly thereafter the Ugandans destroyed the only bridge over the Kagera River, easing their commanders' concerns about a Tanzanian counter-offensive. The Uganda Army pillaged the land, stealing cattle, automobiles, and personal belongings from homes. Approximately 1,500 civilians were shot and killed, and thousands more fled south.\n\nTanzania was caught unprepared for war but Nyerere\u2014after being assured by his commanders of his country's military capability to react\u2014ordered a [[mobilisation]] and instructed the [[Tanzania People's Defence Force]] (TPDF) to prepare a counter-offensive. Mozambique sent a [[battalion]] to Tanzania as a gesture of support. The [[Organisation of African Unity]] attempted to foster a diplomatic solution but Nyerere rejected attempts at mediation. Uganda Army officers concentrated on looting and ignored intelligence reports of Tanzanian plans, and thus were caught unprepared when the TPDF initiated Operation Chakaza. Most Ugandan soldiers fled in the face of artillery bombardment, and Amin soon thereafter declared that he was unconditionally withdrawing the Uganda Army from Kagera, a claim which was bitterly contested by Tanzania. Tanzanian troops used [[pontoon bridge|pontoons]] and a [[Bailey bridge]] to move heavy equipment across the river and probed the area. By January 1979 the TPDF had re-secured the Kagera Salient. Nyerere did not initially intend on expanding the war beyond expelling the Ugandans from Tanzanian territory. After Amin failed to renounce his claims to Kagera and the OAU failed to condemn the Ugandan invasion, Nyerere ordered the TPDF to attack Uganda, resulting in Amin's overthrow in April. Following the conclusion of the war, the Tanzanian government undertook efforts to rehabilitate Kagera, but social services and the standard of living for locals remained diminished for many years. The Uganda\u2013Tanzania War is remembered in Tanzania as the Kagera War.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Idi Amin cropped.jpg|thumb|left|[[Idi Amin]] (pictured) became the [[President of Uganda]] following [[1971 Ugandan coup d'\u00e9tat|a 1971 coup]].]]\n\nIn 1971 Colonel [[Idi Amin]] launched [[1971 Ugandan coup d'\u00e9tat|a military coup]] that overthrew the [[President of Uganda]], [[Milton Obote]], precipitating a deterioration of relations with neighbouring Tanzania.<ref name= honey2/> [[President of Tanzania|Tanzanian President]] [[Julius Nyerere]] had close ties with Obote and had supported his [[Socialism|socialist]] orientation.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=155}} Amin installed himself as President of Uganda and ruled the country under a repressive dictatorship.<ref name= honey2>{{cite news| last = Honey| first = Martha| title = Ugandan Capital Captured| newspaper = The Washington Post| date = 12 April 1979| url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1979/04/12/ugandan-capital-captured/1eb604a7-5ff0-4c51-9fa0-527169e5bffa/?noredirect=on|access-date=7 November 2018}}</ref> Nyerere withheld diplomatic recognition of the new government and offered asylum to Obote and his supporters.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=155}} Uganda twice launched military attacks against the Tanzanian border that year.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=35}} With the approval of Nyerere, Ugandan exiles organised a small army of [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]], and attempted, unsuccessfully, to invade Uganda and remove Amin in 1972.{{efn|Nyerere authorised the attack after hearing rumours of a plot by Uganda and [[Portuguese Mozambique]] to invade Tanzania and depose him.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=35}}}} Amin blamed Nyerere for backing and arming his enemies,{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|pp=6\u20137}} and retaliated by bombing Tanzanian border towns. Though his commanders urged him to respond in kind, Nyerere agreed to mediation overseen by the [[President of Somalia]], [[Siad Barre]], resulting in the signing of the [[Mogadishu Agreement]], which stipulated that Ugandan and Tanzanian forces had to withdraw to positions at least 10 kilometres away from the border and refrain from supporting opposition forces that targeted each other's governments. Nevertheless, relations between the two presidents remained tense; Nyerere frequently denounced Amin's regime, and Amin made repeated threats to invade Tanzania. During the same time, relations between Tanzania and [[Kenya]] grew sour, and the [[East African Community]] subsequently collapsed.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=155}} Uganda also disputed its border with Tanzania, claiming that the [[Kagera Region|Kagera]] Salient\u2014a {{convert|1865|km2}} stretch of land between the official border and the [[Kagera River]] 29 kilometres (18 miles) to the south\u2014should be ceded to Uganda, maintaining that the river made for a more logical border. The border had originally been negotiated by British and German colonial officials before [[World War I]].<ref name= darnton1/>\n\nMeanwhile, in Uganda, Amin announced an \"Economic War\" in which thousands of [[Expulsion of Asians from Uganda|Asian immigrants were expelled]] from the country and their businesses placed under the management of Africans. The reform had disastrous consequences for the economy, which were further exacerbated by a United States boycott of Ugandan coffee on account of the government's failure to respect [[human rights]].{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=155}} At the same time, Amin expanded the power of the armed forces in his government, placing many soldiers in his cabinet and providing those loyal to him with [[patronage]]. Most of the beneficiaries of his actions were Muslim northerners, particularly those of [[Nubians|Nubian]] and Sudanese extract, who were increasingly recruited into the army.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|pp=155\u2013156}} Amin violently purged members of southern ethnic groups from the armed forces and executed political opponents.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=156}} In 1977 a split in the [[Uganda Army (1971\u20131980)|Uganda Army]] developed between supporters of Amin and soldiers loyal to the [[Vice President of Uganda]], [[Mustafa Adrisi]], who held significant power in the government and wanted to purge foreigners from the military. In April 1978 Adrisi was severely injured in a suspicious car accident. When he was flown out of the country for treatment, Amin stripped him of his ministerial portfolios. He also announced the arrest of multiple police officials, and during the following month he dismissed several ministers and military officers.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=49\u201350}} The shakeup strained Amin's narrow base of power in the military that had been declining in the face of the worsening economic situation, which eliminated patronage opportunities.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=156}} Fearing for his personal safety and less confident in his charismatic abilities to diffuse the growing tension, Amin began withdrawing from the public sphere and conducting less visits with his troops. At around the same time he began accusing Tanzania of violating Uganda's border.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=51}} In May, Amin falsely claimed that Tanzanian troops had attacked the [[Rakai District]].{{sfn|Hooper|1999|p=42}} He also appealed to his allies, President [[Gaafar Nimeiry]] of Sudan and leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] of [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi|Libya]] to intervene and resolve the \"potentially explosive\" situation, claiming that Tanzanian forces were moving within 4.8 kilometres (three miles) of Ugandan border towns. In July, Radio Uganda erroneously declared that Obote was planning another Tanzanian-supported overthrow attempt. Nyerere ignored the allegations.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=51}}\n\nIn reality, since May, Ugandan troops and military equipment had been shifted towards the border at Amin's direction and in violation of the Mogadishu Agreement.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=22}} Only one Tanzanian [[Company (military unit)|company]] was near the border region and Obote's irregular troops were in a refugee camp.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=51}} In July, [[Brigadier]] Yusuf Himid of the [[Tanzania People's Defence Force]] (TPDF) warned Uganda to cease its \"repeated provocations\" against Tanzania.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=51\u201352}} As tensions with Tanzania increased, a number of Amin's high-ranking military commanders began to advocate war with the neighbouring state. They were opposed by other Ugandan generals who argued that Uganda Army was not ready for an open conflict. Though desiring to annex part of Tanzania for some time, President Amin initially sided with the more cautious commanders.<ref name= lubega/><ref name=\"lies\">{{cite web| url = http://www.monitor.co.ug/SpecialReports/ugandaat50/Lies-drove-Amin-to-strike-Tanzania/1370466-1628176-14f9t0qz/index.html | title = Lies drove Amin to strike Tanzania | date = 25 November 2012 | website = Daily Monitor| access-date = 14 October 2018}}</ref> In August Amin dispatched several agents to eliminate a battalion planning to mutiny in favour of Adrisi.

Among the incidents identified as possible start points for the war are cases of cattle rustling, tribal tensions, a fight between a Ugandan woman and a Tanzanian woman at a market,{{sfn|Rice|2003|p=11}} as well as a bar fight between a Ugandan soldier and Tanzanian soldiers or civilians.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.monitor.co.ug/Magazines/PeoplePower/Pilot-Omita-MiG21-AminTanzania-Juma-Butabika/689844-4129682-lwlpbkz/index.html | title = Pilot Omita parachutes out of burning MiG-21 | date = 9 October 2017| website = Daily Monitor | access-date = 14 October 2018}}</ref><ref name=barfight/> Several Ugandan soldiers who endorsed the bar fight theory disagreed on the confrontation's exact circumstances, but agreed that the incident occurred on 9 October in a Tanzanian establishment. They also agreed that after Butabika was informed of the altercation, he unilaterally ordered his unit, the Malire Battalion, to attack Tanzania in reprisal. The soldiers stated that Amin was not informed of this decision until later and went along with it to [[save face]].<ref name=barfight>{{cite web| url = https://www.monitor.co.ug/Magazines/PeoplePower/How-bar-fight-sparked-the-1979-Uganda--Tanzania-war/689844-3002788-12ob9gk/index.html| title = How bar fight sparked the 1979 Uganda - Tanzania war| last = Mugabe| first = Faustin| date = 20 December 2015| website = Daily Monitor| access-date = 13 August 2019}}</ref> One Ugandan commander, Bernard Rwehururu, stated that Butabika lied to Amin about his reasons for attacking Kagera, claiming that he was repulsing a Tanzanian invasion.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=24}} According to American journalists Tony Avirgan and Martha Honey, the bar incident occurred on 22 October, when a drunken Ugandan intelligence officer was shot and killed by Tanzanian soldiers after firing on them. That evening Radio Uganda declared that the Tanzanians had abducted a Ugandan soldier, and reported that Amin threatened to do \"something\" if he was not returned.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=57\u201358}}\n\nAnother theory describes the invasion as the result of Ugandan troops chasing mutineers over the Tanzanian border. There are several different variations of this account, which were mostly circulated by non-Ugandan sources.{{sfn|Mambo|Schofield|2007|p=312}} Ugandan diplomat [[Paul Eitang]] and the local managing director for [[Royal Dutch Shell]] reported that soldiers of the Simba Battalion had shot new Sudanese recruits and that when other Ugandan forces were sent to contain them, they fled over the border on 30 October.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|pp=156\u2013157}} ''[[The New York Times]]'' reporter [[John Darnton]] pieced together several refugee accounts which suggested that Amin had possibly planned an invasion of Tanzania to purge followers of Adrisi from the military. Accordingly, the invasion was intended as suicide mission, and any returning troops would be killed upon reentering Uganda. When Simba Battalion deputy commander Lieutenant Colonel Juma Adek was ordered to prepare for the invasion, he suspected the President's plan and mutinied with some of his troops, attacking Sudanese members of the Simba Battalion.<ref name= darnton4/> Other versions attribute the mutinies to elements of the Chui Battalion or the Suicide Battalion.{{sfn|Mambo|Schofield|2007|p=312}} Ugandan historian Phares Mukasa Mutibwa argued that the Simba Battalion initially mutinied under the influence of officers who wanted to restore a civilian government. When Amin sent the Chui Battalion to crush the rebellion, the unit joined the mutineers. He then ordered the Marine Regiment and new recruits to crush the urprising, but they failed.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.independent.co.ug/how-unity-died-in-uganda/| title = How 'unity' died in Uganda | date = 8 April 2019| website = The Indepedent (Kampala)| access-date = 7 March 2020 }}</ref> Political scientist Okon Eminue stated that about 200 mutineers \"reportedly\" took refuge in the Kagera salient.{{sfn|Eminue|2010|p=99}} According to this version of events, Amin ordered the Simba Battalion and the Suicide Battalion to pursue the deserters, resulting in the invasion of Tanzania.{{sfn|Eminue|2010|p=99}} A Ugandan soldier interviewed by ''[[Drum (South African magazine)|Drum]]'' claimed that the initial actions of the invasion were in fact a three-way fight between loyalist Uganda Army soldiers, Ugandan deserters, and Tanzanian border guards, with most of the deserters and a number of Tanzanians being killed.{{sfn|Seftel|2010|pp=223\u2013224}} A few surviving mutineers reportedly found shelter in Tanzanian villages.{{sfn|Seftel|2010|p=224}} Researchers Andrew Mambo and Julian Schofield discounted this theory as unlikely, noting that the battalions that are said to have mutinied remained relatively loyal to Amin's cause throughout the war, and instead supported the notion that Butabika escalated a dispute at the border into an invasion.{{sfn|Mambo|Schofield|2007|pp=312\u2013313}}\n\nThe TPDF had received only very limited intelligence about a possible Ugandan invasion, and was unprepared for this eventuality, as the Tanzanian leadership generally believed that Amin would not consider attacking Tanzania while his own country was affected by political, economic, and military instability.{{sfn|Seftel|2010|p=220}} Even beyond the demilitarised zone established by the Mogadishu Agreement, there were almost no defences. Tanzania had tense relations with [[Zaire]], Kenya, and Malawi, and the only forces defending the land along the Ugandan border was the 202nd Brigade based in [[Tabora]]. It was led by an elderly commander, Brigadier Himid. Near the frontier was the understrength 3rd Battalion, led by Lieutenant Colonel Morris Singano. Its main responsibilities were to conduct reconnaissance and combat smuggling. In early September the Tanzanians reported unusually large numbers of Ugandan patrols near the border\u2014some equipped with [[armoured personnel carrier]]s\u2014and a high volume of air reconnaissance flights. By the middle of the month the Ugandan aircraft began crossing into Tanzanian airspace.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=53}} Singano reported the unusual activity to the brigade headquarters in Tabora, and was assured that anti-aircraft guns would be sent to him. These never arrived, and by October Singano's warnings had become increasingly panicked.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=53\u201354}}\n\n=== Initial actions ===\n[[File:Uganda Army OT-64 APC.jpg|thumb|left|When the Uganda Army invaded Kagera, it deployed several [[OT-64 SKOT]] armoured personnel carriers (example in Ugandan service pictured).]]\n\nIn the middle of the day on 9 October Ugandan troops made their first incursion into Tanzania when a motorised detachment moved into Kakunyu and set two houses on fire. A Tanzanian observation post witnessed the event and contacted Singano via radio, who subsequently ordered his artillery to open fire on Ugandan positions. A Ugandan armoured personnel carrier and truck were destroyed, and two soldiers were killed. Ugandan artillery returned fire but caused no damage. In the evening Radio Uganda reported that a Tanzanian invasion had been repulsed.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=54}} The Tanzanian Foreign Ministry denied the allegation on 12 October.{{sfn|Acheson-Brown|2001|p=5}}{{efn|Foreign diplomats familiar with Amin dismissed accusations of a Tanzanian invasion as a \"smokescreen\".<ref name= darnton1/>}}\n\nOn 10 October Ugandan [[List of Mikoyan and MiG aircraft|MiG]] fighters bombed Tanzanian forests. Ugandan artillery continuously bombarded Tanzanian territory, so Singano requested that his 120&nbsp;mm mortars\u2014the largest calibre artillery he had\u2014be moved to the front line. They were brought into action four days later, and the Ugandan guns subsequently stopped firing. Over the next few days both sides exchanged artillery fire, gradually expanding across the whole border. Tanzanian leaders felt that Amin was only making provocations. Singano sent increasingly urgent requests for help, and was eventually told that reinforcements would be sent.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=54}}\n\nOn 18 October Ugandan MiGs bombed [[Bukoba]], the capital of the [[Kagera Region|West Lake Region]]. Despite facing ineffectual Tanzanian anti-aircraft fire, the bombings caused little damage, but the explosions shattered windows caused panic.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=54}} The following day West Lake Regional Commissioner Mohamed Kissoky hosted a meeting with government and [[Chama Cha Mapinduzi]] (CCM, the state political party) officials. He told them that the border conflict was the result of a misunderstanding and encouraged them to reiterate that \"we are great friends with Uganda, and Idi Amin has been at that border shaking hands with our people.\"{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=56}} Despite Kissoky's appeal for calm, Bukoba residents continued to panic, their anxieties worsened by exaggerated stories of battles from fleeing villagers from the north. Aside from Kissoky, Tanzanian leaders did not make any public comments about the conflict, and [[Radio Tanzania Dar es Salaam|Radio Tanzania]] did not report on it. In contrast, Radio Uganda reported a Tanzanian \"invasion\" of Ugandan territory with accounts of fictional battles, and detailed that Tanzanian troops had advanced 15 kilometres (9.3 miles) into Uganda, killing civilians and destroying property. Amin told residents in Mutukula that in spite of the \"attack\", he still hoped for good relations with Tanzania. At the same time, Radio Uganda's Kinyankole language broadcasts\u2014which were closely monitored and understood by West Lake residents\u2014severely criticised Nyerere and claimed that Tanzanians wished to fall under Ugandan jurisdiction to escape the former's rule.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=56}} Meanwhile, the Ugandan regime came under increased internal strain. Dozens of soldiers of the Masaka garrison deemed disloyal were executed, rival State Research Bureau agents engaged in a shootout in Kampala, and more agents were killed while attempting to arrest a former finance minister.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=56}}\n\n== Invasion ==\n{{see also|Air campaign of the Uganda\u2013Tanzania War}}\n=== First attack ===\n[[File:T-55 skos RB.jpg|thumb|The Ugandan attack included numerous [[Vehicle armour|armoured vehicles]], including [[T-54/T-55|T-55]] tanks (example pictured) ]]\n\nAt dawn on 25 October{{efn|According to Ugandan sources, the first major attack took place on 22 October.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=24}} Journalist Dominique Lagarde stated that fighting began when the Uganda Army started to shell Bukoba on 27 October.{{sfn|Lagarde|1979|p=2}} }} Tanzanian observers equipped with a telescope noticed large amounts of Ugandan vehicular activity in Mutukula. Singano received radio reports on the situation at his headquarters in [[Kyaka]], {{convert|32|km}} south of the border and just south of the Kagera River. Several minutes later three other observation posts reported Ugandan manoeuvres on the other side of the border. Singano went to a hill near Kyaka from where he witnessed Ugandan artillery open fire. Fifteen minutes later he received a radio message from an understrength [[platoon]] of 20 TPDF soldiers opposite Mutukula, who reported that they were under attack and exchanging heavy fire with the Uganda Army. All other Tanzanian soldiers broke under fire and fled towards the Kagera River. Realising that an invasion was underway, Singano ordered the platoon near Mutukula to retreat to Kyaka.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=58}} Over 2,000 Ugandan soldiers under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Marajani,{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=58\u201359}}{{efn|Journalist James Tumusiime transliterates this name as \"Marjan\".{{sfn|Tumusiime|1992|p=14}} Lieutenant Colonel Hussein Marijan was known to have served as Simba Battalion commander along the Uganda-Tanzania border in 1977.{{sfn|Omara-Otunnu|1987|pp=139\u2013140}} }} Butabika, and Kisuule attacked Kagera.

Marajani reported heavy resistance despite the fact that all TPDF personnel had withdrawn from the border area. Believing that his enemies were confused about the situation, at mid-morning Singano ordered an artillery unit to the front to put up resistance.

Realising the veracity of Singano's warnings in light of the action, Tanzanian commanders dispatched a six-strong anti-aircraft team equipped with [[9K32 Strela-2|SA-7]] shoulder-fired [[heat-seeking missile]]s from Tabora to the front.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=25}}{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=59\u201360}} The unit arrived in Bukoba on 27 October.

Most of their bombs landed in [[Lake Victoria]] and nearby forests, though one landed 50 metres (164 ft) from the hospital, creating a large crater. Aside from some broken windows the raid caused little damage, but the population was frightened and by afternoon the roads leading out of the town were full of people evacuating via vehicle and foot.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=59}} By the next morning Bukoba was almost completely deserted except for TPDF personnel.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=59\u201360}} The Tanzanian missile team moved to Kyaka, from where they successfully shot down a MiG.

For the tens of thousands who could not move as far, the situation was deteriorating as conditions grew crowded and food and water became scarce. Some merchants began engaging in [[price gouging]]. Local officials attempted to alleviate the problem by bringing in food from government stockpiles. This became unfeasible as Singano commandeered most remaining vehicles to move his troops and artillery. The Tanzanian state-run news media did not report on the conflict, adding to the confusion of the civilians. Most of the Bukoba men resolved to return to their town to resume work while leaving their families in the countryside. Meanwhile, Singano petitioned his superiors in Tabora for reinforcements. They assured him that assistance was on its way, but no troops ever arrived.

The Ugandans met light resistance and in November President [[Idi Amin]] of Uganda announced the annexation of all Tanzanian land north of the [[Kagera River]]. The Tanzanians organised a [[counter-offensive]] later in November and successfully ejected the Ugandan forces from their country.\n\nRelations between Tanzania and Uganda had been tense since then-Colonel Amin overthrew Ugandan President [[Milton Obote]] in 1971. Tanzanian President [[Julius Nyerere]] supported Obote and backed an unsuccessful attempt by him to regain power in 1972. Uganda also disputed its border with Tanzania, claiming that the Kagera Salient\u2014a {{convert|1865|km2}} stretch of land between the official border and the Kagera River {{convert|29|km}} to the south\u2014should be ceded to Uganda. Tensions remained high through 1978, when Amin's regime started rapidly declining due to economic problems and dissent in the armed forces. In early October Ugandan forces began making small incursions into the Kagera region. On 25 October the [[Uganda Army (1971\u20131980)|Uganda Army]] launched a large attack over the border, but was repulsed by Tanzanian artillery. The Ugandans attacked again on 30 October, quickly overwhelming the small Tanzanian contingent in the region and completely occupying the Kagera Salient. Amin declared that Uganda was annexing the region, and shortly thereafter the Ugandans destroyed the only bridge over the Kagera River, easing their commanders' concerns about a Tanzanian counter-offensive. The Uganda Army pillaged the land, stealing cattle, automobiles, and personal belongings from homes. Approximately 1,500 civilians were shot and killed, and thousands more fled south.\n\nTanzania was caught unprepared for war but Nyerere\u2014after being assured by his commanders of his country's military capability to react\u2014ordered a [[mobilisation]] and instructed the [[Tanzania People's Defence Force]] (TPDF) to prepare a counter-offensive. Mozambique sent a [[battalion]] to Tanzania as a gesture of support. The [[Organisation of African Unity]] attempted to foster a diplomatic solution but Nyerere rejected attempts at mediation. Uganda Army officers concentrated on looting and ignored intelligence reports of Tanzanian plans, and thus were caught unprepared when the TPDF initiated Operation Chakaza. Most Ugandan soldiers fled in the face of artillery bombardment, and Amin soon thereafter declared that he was unconditionally withdrawing the Uganda Army from Kagera, a claim which was bitterly contested by Tanzania. Tanzanian troops used [[pontoon bridge|pontoons]] and a [[Bailey bridge]] to move heavy equipment across the river and probed the area. By January 1979 the TPDF had re-secured the Kagera Salient. Nyerere did not initially intend on expanding the war beyond expelling the Ugandans from Tanzanian territory. After Amin failed to renounce his claims to Kagera and the OAU failed to condemn the Ugandan invasion, Nyerere ordered the TPDF to attack Uganda, resulting in Amin's overthrow in April. Following the conclusion of the war, the Tanzanian government undertook efforts to rehabilitate Kagera, but social services and the standard of living for locals remained diminished for many years. The Uganda\u2013Tanzania War is remembered in Tanzania as the Kagera War.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Idi Amin cropped.jpg|thumb|left|[[Idi Amin]] (pictured) became the [[President of Uganda]] following [[1971 Ugandan coup d'\u00e9tat|a 1971 coup]].]]\n\nIn 1971 Colonel [[Idi Amin]] launched [[1971 Ugandan coup d'\u00e9tat|a military coup]] that overthrew the [[President of Uganda]], [[Milton Obote]], precipitating a deterioration of relations with neighbouring Tanzania.<ref name= honey2/> [[President of Tanzania|Tanzanian President]] [[Julius Nyerere]] had close ties with Obote and had supported his [[Socialism|socialist]] orientation.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=155}} Amin installed himself as President of Uganda and ruled the country under a repressive dictatorship.<ref name= honey2>{{cite news| last = Honey| first = Martha| title = Ugandan Capital Captured| newspaper = The Washington Post| date = 12 April 1979| url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1979/04/12/ugandan-capital-captured/1eb604a7-5ff0-4c51-9fa0-527169e5bffa/?noredirect=on|access-date=7 November 2018}}</ref> Nyerere withheld diplomatic recognition of the new government and offered asylum to Obote and his supporters.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=155}} Uganda twice launched military attacks against the Tanzanian border that year.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=35}} With the approval of Nyerere, Ugandan exiles organised a small army of [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]], and attempted, unsuccessfully, to invade Uganda and remove Amin in 1972.{{efn|Nyerere authorised the attack after hearing rumours of a plot by Uganda and [[Portuguese Mozambique]] to invade Tanzania and depose him.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=35}}}} Amin blamed Nyerere for backing and arming his enemies,{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|pp=6\u20137}} and retaliated by bombing Tanzanian border towns. Though his commanders urged him to respond in kind, Nyerere agreed to mediation overseen by the [[President of Somalia]], [[Siad Barre]], resulting in the signing of the [[Mogadishu Agreement]], which stipulated that Ugandan and Tanzanian forces had to withdraw to positions at least 10 kilometres away from the border and refrain from supporting opposition forces that targeted each other's governments. Nevertheless, relations between the two presidents remained tense; Nyerere frequently denounced Amin's regime, and Amin made repeated threats to invade Tanzania. During the same time, relations between Tanzania and [[Kenya]] grew sour, and the [[East African Community]] subsequently collapsed.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=155}} Uganda also disputed its border with Tanzania, claiming that the [[Kagera Region|Kagera]] Salient\u2014a {{convert|1865|km2}} stretch of land between the official border and the [[Kagera River]] 29 kilometres (18 miles) to the south\u2014should be ceded to Uganda, maintaining that the river made for a more logical border. The border had originally been negotiated by British and German colonial officials before [[World War I]].<ref name= darnton1/>\n\nMeanwhile, in Uganda, Amin announced an \"Economic War\" in which thousands of [[Expulsion of Asians from Uganda|Asian immigrants were expelled]] from the country and their businesses placed under the management of Africans. The reform had disastrous consequences for the economy, which were further exacerbated by a United States boycott of Ugandan coffee on account of the government's failure to respect [[human rights]].{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=155}} At the same time, Amin expanded the power of the armed forces in his government, placing many soldiers in his cabinet and providing those loyal to him with [[patronage]]. Most of the beneficiaries of his actions were Muslim northerners, particularly those of [[Nubians|Nubian]] and Sudanese extract, who were increasingly recruited into the army.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|pp=155\u2013156}} Amin violently purged members of southern ethnic groups from the armed forces and executed political opponents.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=156}} In 1977 a split in the [[Uganda Army (1971\u20131980)|Uganda Army]] developed between supporters of Amin and soldiers loyal to the [[Vice President of Uganda]], [[Mustafa Adrisi]], who held significant power in the government and wanted to purge foreigners from the military. In April 1978 Adrisi was severely injured in a suspicious car accident. When he was flown out of the country for treatment, Amin stripped him of his ministerial portfolios. He also announced the arrest of multiple police officials, and during the following month he dismissed several ministers and military officers.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=49\u201350}} The shakeup strained Amin's narrow base of power in the military that had been declining in the face of the worsening economic situation, which eliminated patronage opportunities.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=156}} Fearing for his personal safety and less confident in his charismatic abilities to diffuse the growing tension, Amin began withdrawing from the public sphere and conducting less visits with his troops. At around the same time he began accusing Tanzania of violating Uganda's border.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=51}} In May, Amin falsely claimed that Tanzanian troops had attacked the [[Rakai District]].{{sfn|Hooper|1999|p=42}} He also appealed to his allies, President [[Gaafar Nimeiry]] of Sudan and leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] of [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi|Libya]] to intervene and resolve the \"potentially explosive\" situation, claiming that Tanzanian forces were moving within 4.8 kilometres (three miles) of Ugandan border towns. In July, Radio Uganda erroneously declared that Obote was planning another Tanzanian-supported overthrow attempt. Nyerere ignored the allegations.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=51}}\n\nIn reality, since May, Ugandan troops and military equipment had been shifted towards the border at Amin's direction and in violation of the Mogadishu Agreement.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=22}} Only one Tanzanian [[Company (military unit)|company]] was near the border region and Obote's irregular troops were in a refugee camp.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=51}} In July, [[Brigadier]] Yusuf Himid of the [[Tanzania People's Defence Force]] (TPDF) warned Uganda to cease its \"repeated provocations\" against Tanzania.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=51\u201352}} As tensions with Tanzania increased, a number of Amin's high-ranking military commanders began to advocate war with the neighbouring state. They were opposed by other Ugandan generals who argued that Uganda Army was not ready for an open conflict. Though desiring to annex part of Tanzania for some time, President Amin initially sided with the more cautious commanders.<ref name= lubega/><ref name=\"lies\">{{cite web| url = http://www.monitor.co.ug/SpecialReports/ugandaat50/Lies-drove-Amin-to-strike-Tanzania/1370466-1628176-14f9t0qz/index.html | title = Lies drove Amin to strike Tanzania | date = 25 November 2012 | website = Daily Monitor| access-date = 14 October 2018}}</ref> In August Amin dispatched several agents to eliminate a battalion planning to mutiny in favour of Adrisi.

Among the incidents identified as possible start points for the war are cases of cattle rustling, tribal tensions, a fight between a Ugandan woman and a Tanzanian woman at a market,{{sfn|Rice|2003|p=11}} as well as a bar fight between a Ugandan soldier and Tanzanian soldiers or civilians.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.monitor.co.ug/Magazines/PeoplePower/Pilot-Omita-MiG21-AminTanzania-Juma-Butabika/689844-4129682-lwlpbkz/index.html | title = Pilot Omita parachutes out of burning MiG-21 | date = 9 October 2017| website = Daily Monitor | access-date = 14 October 2018}}</ref><ref name=barfight/> Several Ugandan soldiers who endorsed the bar fight theory disagreed on the confrontation's exact circumstances, but agreed that the incident occurred on 9 October in a Tanzanian establishment. They also agreed that after Butabika was informed of the altercation, he unilaterally ordered his unit, the Malire Battalion, to attack Tanzania in reprisal. The soldiers stated that Amin was not informed of this decision until later and went along with it to [[save face]].<ref name=barfight>{{cite web| url = https://www.monitor.co.ug/Magazines/PeoplePower/How-bar-fight-sparked-the-1979-Uganda--Tanzania-war/689844-3002788-12ob9gk/index.html| title = How bar fight sparked the 1979 Uganda - Tanzania war| last = Mugabe| first = Faustin| date = 20 December 2015| website = Daily Monitor| access-date = 13 August 2019}}</ref> One Ugandan commander, Bernard Rwehururu, stated that Butabika lied to Amin about his reasons for attacking Kagera, claiming that he was repulsing a Tanzanian invasion.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=24}} According to American journalists Tony Avirgan and Martha Honey, the bar incident occurred on 22 October, when a drunken Ugandan intelligence officer was shot and killed by Tanzanian soldiers after firing on them. That evening Radio Uganda declared that the Tanzanians had abducted a Ugandan soldier, and reported that Amin threatened to do \"something\" if he was not returned.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=57\u201358}}\n\nAnother theory describes the invasion as the result of Ugandan troops chasing mutineers over the Tanzanian border. There are several different variations of this account, which were mostly circulated by non-Ugandan sources.{{sfn|Mambo|Schofield|2007|p=312}} Ugandan diplomat [[Paul Eitang]] and the local managing director for [[Royal Dutch Shell]] reported that soldiers of the Simba Battalion had shot new Sudanese recruits and that when other Ugandan forces were sent to contain them, they fled over the border on 30 October.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|pp=156\u2013157}} ''[[The New York Times]]'' reporter [[John Darnton]] pieced together several refugee accounts which suggested that Amin had possibly planned an invasion of Tanzania to purge followers of Adrisi from the military. Accordingly, the invasion was intended as suicide mission, and any returning troops would be killed upon reentering Uganda. When Simba Battalion deputy commander Lieutenant Colonel Juma Adek was ordered to prepare for the invasion, he suspected the President's plan and mutinied with some of his troops, attacking Sudanese members of the Simba Battalion.<ref name= darnton4/> Other versions attribute the mutinies to elements of the Chui Battalion or the Suicide Battalion.{{sfn|Mambo|Schofield|2007|p=312}} Ugandan historian Phares Mukasa Mutibwa argued that the Simba Battalion initially mutinied under the influence of officers who wanted to restore a civilian government. When Amin sent the Chui Battalion to crush the rebellion, the unit joined the mutineers. He then ordered the Marine Regiment and new recruits to crush the urprising, but they failed.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.independent.co.ug/how-unity-died-in-uganda/| title = How 'unity' died in Uganda | date = 8 April 2019| website = The Indepedent (Kampala)| access-date = 7 March 2020 }}</ref> Political scientist Okon Eminue stated that about 200 mutineers \"reportedly\" took refuge in the Kagera salient.{{sfn|Eminue|2010|p=99}} According to this version of events, Amin ordered the Simba Battalion and the Suicide Battalion to pursue the deserters, resulting in the invasion of Tanzania.{{sfn|Eminue|2010|p=99}} A Ugandan soldier interviewed by ''[[Drum (South African magazine)|Drum]]'' claimed that the initial actions of the invasion were in fact a three-way fight between loyalist Uganda Army soldiers, Ugandan deserters, and Tanzanian border guards, with most of the deserters and a number of Tanzanians being killed.{{sfn|Seftel|2010|pp=223\u2013224}} A few surviving mutineers reportedly found shelter in Tanzanian villages.{{sfn|Seftel|2010|p=224}} Researchers Andrew Mambo and Julian Schofield discounted this theory as unlikely, noting that the battalions that are said to have mutinied remained relatively loyal to Amin's cause throughout the war, and instead supported the notion that Butabika escalated a dispute at the border into an invasion.{{sfn|Mambo|Schofield|2007|pp=312\u2013313}}\n\nThe TPDF had received only very limited intelligence about a possible Ugandan invasion, and was unprepared for this eventuality, as the Tanzanian leadership generally believed that Amin would not consider attacking Tanzania while his own country was affected by political, economic, and military instability.{{sfn|Seftel|2010|p=220}} Even beyond the demilitarised zone established by the Mogadishu Agreement, there were almost no defences. Tanzania had tense relations with [[Zaire]], Kenya, and Malawi, and the only forces defending the land along the Ugandan border was the 202nd Brigade based in [[Tabora]]. It was led by an elderly commander, Brigadier Himid. Near the frontier was the understrength 3rd Battalion, led by Lieutenant Colonel Morris Singano. Its main responsibilities were to conduct reconnaissance and combat smuggling. In early September the Tanzanians reported unusually large numbers of Ugandan patrols near the border\u2014some equipped with [[armoured personnel carrier]]s\u2014and a high volume of air reconnaissance flights. By the middle of the month the Ugandan aircraft began crossing into Tanzanian airspace.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=53}} Singano reported the unusual activity to the brigade headquarters in Tabora, and was assured that anti-aircraft guns would be sent to him. These never arrived, and by October Singano's warnings had become increasingly panicked.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=53\u201354}}\n\n=== Initial actions ===\n[[File:Uganda Army OT-64 APC.jpg|thumb|left|When the Uganda Army invaded Kagera, it deployed several [[OT-64 SKOT]] armoured personnel carriers (example in Ugandan service pictured).]]\n\nIn the middle of the day on 9 October Ugandan troops made their first incursion into Tanzania when a motorised detachment moved into Kakunyu and set two houses on fire. A Tanzanian observation post witnessed the event and contacted Singano via radio, who subsequently ordered his artillery to open fire on Ugandan positions. A Ugandan armoured personnel carrier and truck were destroyed, and two soldiers were killed. Ugandan artillery returned fire but caused no damage. In the evening Radio Uganda reported that a Tanzanian invasion had been repulsed.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=54}} The Tanzanian Foreign Ministry denied the allegation on 12 October.{{sfn|Acheson-Brown|2001|p=5}}{{efn|Foreign diplomats familiar with Amin dismissed accusations of a Tanzanian invasion as a \"smokescreen\".<ref name= darnton1/>}}\n\nOn 10 October Ugandan [[List of Mikoyan and MiG aircraft|MiG]] fighters bombed Tanzanian forests. Ugandan artillery continuously bombarded Tanzanian territory, so Singano requested that his 120&nbsp;mm mortars\u2014the largest calibre artillery he had\u2014be moved to the front line. They were brought into action four days later, and the Ugandan guns subsequently stopped firing. Over the next few days both sides exchanged artillery fire, gradually expanding across the whole border. Tanzanian leaders felt that Amin was only making provocations. Singano sent increasingly urgent requests for help, and was eventually told that reinforcements would be sent.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=54}}\n\nOn 18 October Ugandan MiGs bombed [[Bukoba]], the capital of the [[Kagera Region|West Lake Region]]. Despite facing ineffectual Tanzanian anti-aircraft fire, the bombings caused little damage, but the explosions shattered windows caused panic.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=54}} The following day West Lake Regional Commissioner Mohamed Kissoky hosted a meeting with government and [[Chama Cha Mapinduzi]] (CCM, the state political party) officials. He told them that the border conflict was the result of a misunderstanding and encouraged them to reiterate that \"we are great friends with Uganda, and Idi Amin has been at that border shaking hands with our people.\"{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=56}} Despite Kissoky's appeal for calm, Bukoba residents continued to panic, their anxieties worsened by exaggerated stories of battles from fleeing villagers from the north. Aside from Kissoky, Tanzanian leaders did not make any public comments about the conflict, and [[Radio Tanzania Dar es Salaam|Radio Tanzania]] did not report on it. In contrast, Radio Uganda reported a Tanzanian \"invasion\" of Ugandan territory with accounts of fictional battles, and detailed that Tanzanian troops had advanced 15 kilometres (9.3 miles) into Uganda, killing civilians and destroying property. Amin told residents in Mutukula that in spite of the \"attack\", he still hoped for good relations with Tanzania. At the same time, Radio Uganda's Kinyankole language broadcasts\u2014which were closely monitored and understood by West Lake residents\u2014severely criticised Nyerere and claimed that Tanzanians wished to fall under Ugandan jurisdiction to escape the former's rule.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=56}} Meanwhile, the Ugandan regime came under increased internal strain.

Singano received radio reports on the situation at his headquarters in [[Kyaka]], {{convert|32|km}} south of the border and just south of the Kagera River. Several minutes later three other observation posts reported Ugandan manoeuvres on the other side of the border. Singano went to a hill near Kyaka from where he witnessed Ugandan artillery open fire. Fifteen minutes later he received a radio message from an understrength [[platoon]] of 20 TPDF soldiers opposite Mutukula, who reported that they were under attack and exchanging heavy fire with the Uganda Army. All other Tanzanian soldiers broke under fire and fled towards the Kagera River.

Marajani reported heavy resistance despite the fact that all TPDF personnel had withdrawn from the border area. Believing that his enemies were confused about the situation, at mid-morning Singano ordered an artillery unit to the front to put up resistance. It was equipped with 122{{nbs}}mm (4.8{{nbs}}in) mortars, a 120{{nbs}}mm (4.7{{nbs}}in) [[howitzer]], and a few 85{{nbs}}mm (3.3{{nbs}}in) guns.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=58\u201359}} Stationed in the area around Bumazi,{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=24}} the unit set up its artillery {{convert|10|km}} from the Ugandans and fired several shells, causing them to retreat across the border.{{efn|According to Ugandan sources, the first attack on Kagera was repelled after one day had passed.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=24}} }} Throughout the rest of the day Ugandan MiGs crossed into Tanzanian airspace, where they were harassed by inconsequential anti-aircraft fire.

Realising the veracity of Singano's warnings in light of the action, Tanzanian commanders dispatched a six-strong anti-aircraft team equipped with [[9K32 Strela-2|SA-7]] shoulder-fired [[heat-seeking missile]]s from Tabora to the front.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=25}}{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=59\u201360}} The unit arrived in Bukoba on 27 October.

Most of their bombs landed in [[Lake Victoria]] and nearby forests, though one landed 50 metres (164 ft) from the hospital, creating a large crater. Aside from some broken windows the raid caused little damage, but the population was frightened and by afternoon the roads leading out of the town were full of people evacuating via vehicle and foot.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=59}} By the next morning Bukoba was almost completely deserted except for TPDF personnel.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=59\u201360}} The Tanzanian missile team moved to Kyaka, from where they successfully shot down a MiG.

Those equipped with vehicles, such as [[United Nations Development Programme]] personnel, drove to [[Mwanza]]. For the tens of thousands who could not move as far, the situation was deteriorating as conditions grew crowded and food and water became scarce. Some merchants began engaging in [[price gouging]]. Local officials attempted to alleviate the problem by bringing in food from government stockpiles. This became unfeasible as Singano commandeered most remaining vehicles to move his troops and artillery. The Tanzanian state-run news media did not report on the conflict, adding to the confusion of the civilians. Most of the Bukoba men resolved to return to their town to resume work while leaving their families in the countryside. Meanwhile, Singano petitioned his superiors in Tabora for reinforcements. They assured him that assistance was on its way, but no troops ever arrived. Over the next few days he busied himself with trying keep his artillery mobile.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=60}}\n\nAt the same time, the Ugandans prepared a new attack. Amin ordered the [[Moroto Town|Moroto]]-based Gonda Battalion to aid the invasion, but its commander, Lieutenant Colonel Yefusa Bananuka, had only been appointed a few days before the war's outbreak.

The season consists of 12 matches per team, 6 home and 6 away, usually with one match per week for each team. Because the league has an odd number of teams, at least one team each week does not play. In most weeks, the league has scheduled one match on Thursday and the remaining matches on Saturday and Sunday. To date, two matches have had to be rescheduled due to bushfires, either because of direct fire threat or because of smoke.\n\n===League table===\n{{2019\u201320 W-League table}}\n===Results===\n{{#invoke:sports results|main\n|update        = 23 January 2020\n|source        = [https://www.w-league.com.au/fixtures#!/results/s2019/r1 W-League]\n|font_size     = 100%\n|matches_style = FBR\n|a_note        = yes\n|solid_cell    = grey\n\n|team1 = ADE\n|team2 = BRI\n|team3 = CNU\n|team4 = MCY\n|team5 = MVC\n|team6 = NEW\n|team7 = PER\n|team8 = SYD\n|team9 = WSW\n\n|name_ADE = [[Adelaide United FC|Adelaide United]]\n|name_BRI = [[Brisbane Roar FC|Brisbane Roar]]\n|name_CNU = [[Canberra United FC|Canberra United]]\n|name_MCY = [[Melbourne City FC|Melbourne City]]\n|name_MVC = [[Melbourne Victory FC|Melbourne Victory]]\n|name_NEW = [[Newcastle Jets FC|Newcastle Jets]]\n|name_PER = [[Perth Glory FC|Perth Glory]]\n|name_SYD = [[Sydney FC]]\n|name_WSW = [[Western Sydney Wanderers FC|Western Sydney Wanderers]]\n\n|match_ADE_BRI= null\n|match_ADE_CNU= 1\u20132\n|match_ADE_MCY= null\n|match_ADE_MVC= 0\u20133\n|match_ADE_NEW= 2\u20131\n|match_ADE_PER= 2\u20132\n|match_ADE_SYD= 0\u20131\n|match_ADE_WSW= 3\u20132\n\n|match_BRI_ADE= 3\u20132\n|match_BRI_CNU= 5\u20130\n|match_BRI_MCY= 0\u20132\n|match_BRI_MVC= 2\u20133\n|match_BRI_NEW= 2\u20131\n|match_BRI_PER= null\n|match_BRI_SYD= null\n|match_BRI_WSW= 1\u20133\n\n|match_CNU_ADE= 3\u20131\n|match_CNU_BRI= 1\u20132\n|match_CNU_MCY= 1\u20132\n|match_CNU_MVC= null\n|match_CNU_NEW= null\n|match_CNU_PER= 2\u20130\n|match_CNU_SYD= 0\u20134\n|match_CNU_WSW= 0\u20134\n\n|match_MCY_ADE= 1\u20130\n|match_MCY_BRI= 3\u20131\n|match_MCY_CNU= 4\u20130\n|match_MCY_MVC= [[Melbourne Derby (A-League)|1\u20130]]\n|match_MCY_NEW= 2\u20130\n|match_MCY_PER= 1\u20130\n|match_MCY_SYD= null\n|match_MCY_WSW= null\n\n|match_MVC_ADE= null\n|match_MVC_BRI= 0\u20130\n|match_MVC_CNU= 3\u20130\n|match_MVC_MCY= [[Melbourne Derby (A-League)|0\u20134]]\n|match_MVC_NEW= 2\u20131\n|match_MVC_PER= null\n|match_MVC_SYD= [[The Big Blue (A-League)|3\u20131]]\n|match_MVC_WSW= 1\u20131\n\n|match_NEW_ADE= 2\u20130\n|match_NEW_BRI= null\n|match_NEW_CNU= 2\u20133\n|match_NEW_MCY= 1\u20131\n|match_NEW_MVC= 0\u20137\n|match_NEW_PER= 2\u20134\n|match_NEW_SYD= 0\u20132\n|match_NEW_WSW= null\n\n|match_PER_ADE= null\n|match_PER_BRI= 4\u20132\n|match_PER_CNU= 1\u20131\n|match_PER_MCY= null\n|match_PER_MVC= 1\u20132\n|match_PER_NEW= 1\u20132\n|match_PER_SYD= 1\u20133\n|match_PER_WSW= 2\u20133\n\n|match_SYD_ADE= 2\u20130\n|match_SYD_BRI= 0\u20130\n|match_SYD_CNU= null\n|match_SYD_MCY= 1\u20132\n|match_SYD_MVC= [[The Big Blue (A-League)|3\u20130]]\n|match_SYD_NEW= null\n|match_SYD_PER= 1\u20132\n|match_SYD_WSW= [[Sydney Derby (A-League)|3\u20130]]\n\n|match_WSW_ADE= 2\u20131\n|match_WSW_BRI= 0\u20134\n|match_WSW_CNU= null\n|match_WSW_MCY= 0\u20134\n|match_WSW_MVC= null\n|match_WSW_NEW= 1\u20130\n|match_WSW_PER= 3\u20131\n|match_WSW_SYD= [[Sydney Derby (A-League)|5\u20130]]\n}}\n\n===Positions by round===\n{{#invoke:sports rbr table|table|sortable=y|legendpos=br\n\n|team1= [[Melbourne City FC (W-League)|Melbourne City]]\n| pos1= 4/3/3/2/1/1/2/1/1/1/1/1/1/1\n|team2= [[Melbourne Victory FC (W-League)|Melbourne Victory]]\n| pos2= 9/5/5/6/7/6/6/4/5/5/4/4/3/2\n|team3= [[Sydney FC (W-League)|Sydney FC]]\n| pos3= 1/1/1/3/2/3/3/3/2/3/3/2/2/3\n|team4= [[Western Sydney Wanderers FC (W-League)|Western Sydney Wanderers]]\n| pos4= 3/2/2/1/3/2/1/2/3/2/2/3/4/4\n|team5= [[Brisbane Roar FC (W-League)|Brisbane Roar]]\n| pos5= 6/7/7/7/5/5/4/5/4/4/5/5/5/5\n|team6= [[Canberra United FC|Canberra United]]\n| pos6= 2/4/4/4/4/4/5/6/6/6/6/6/6/6\n|team7= [[Perth Glory FC (W-League)|Perth Glory]]\n| pos7= 8/9/9/9/8/8/8/8/8/8/8/7/7/7\n|team8= [[Adelaide United FC (W-League)|Adelaide United]]\n| pos8= 7/8/8/8/9/9/9/9/9/9/9/9/9/8\n|team9= [[Newcastle Jets FC (W-League)|Newcastle Jets]]\n| pos9= 5/6/6/5/6/7/7/7/7/7/7/8/8/9\n\n| color_1=green1 |text_1= Leader and qualification to [[#Finals series|Finals series]]\n| color_2-4=green2 |text_2-4= Qualification to [[#Finals series|Finals series]]\n|source=[http://www.w-league.com.au/ladder w-league.com.au]\n|update=22 February 2020\n}}\n\n==Fixtures==\n\n===Round 1===\n{{footballbox collapsible\n|date       = 14 November 2019\n|team1      = [[Western Sydney Wanderers FC (W-League)|Western Sydney Wanderers]]\n|time       = 19:30 [[UTC+11:00|AEDT]]\n|score      = 2\u20131\n|report     = https://www.w-league.com.au/match/western-sydney-wanderers-fc-women-v-adelaide-united-women-w-league-14-11-2019/2032852\n|team2      = [[Adelaide United FC (W-League)|Adelaide United]]\n|goals1     = \n*[[Kristen Hamilton|Hamilton]] {{goal|44}}\n*[[Kyra Cooney-Cross|Cooney-Cross]] {{goal|90+2}}\n|goals2     = \n* [[Mary Fowler (soccer)|M.

The season consists of 12 matches per team, 6 home and 6 away, usually with one match per week for each team. Because the league has an odd number of teams, at least one team each week does not play. In most weeks, the league has scheduled one match on Thursday and the remaining matches on Saturday and Sunday. To date, two matches have had to be rescheduled due to bushfires, either because of direct fire threat or because of smoke.\n\n===League table===\n{{2019\u201320 W-League table}}\n===Results===\n{{#invoke:sports results|main\n|update        = 23 January 2020\n|source        = [https://www.w-league.com.au/fixtures#!/results/s2019/r1 W-League]\n|font_size     = 100%\n|matches_style = FBR\n|a_note        = yes\n|solid_cell    = grey\n\n|team1 = ADE\n|team2 = BRI\n|team3 = CNU\n|team4 = MCY\n|team5 = MVC\n|team6 = NEW\n|team7 = PER\n|team8 = SYD\n|team9 = WSW\n\n|name_ADE = [[Adelaide United FC|Adelaide United]]\n|name_BRI = [[Brisbane Roar FC|Brisbane Roar]]\n|name_CNU = [[Canberra United FC|Canberra United]]\n|name_MCY = [[Melbourne City FC|Melbourne City]]\n|name_MVC = [[Melbourne Victory FC|Melbourne Victory]]\n|name_NEW = [[Newcastle Jets FC|Newcastle Jets]]\n|name_PER = [[Perth Glory FC|Perth Glory]]\n|name_SYD = [[Sydney FC]]\n|name_WSW = [[Western Sydney Wanderers FC|Western Sydney Wanderers]]\n\n|match_ADE_BRI= null\n|match_ADE_CNU= 1\u20132\n|match_ADE_MCY= null\n|match_ADE_MVC= 0\u20133\n|match_ADE_NEW= 2\u20131\n|match_ADE_PER= 2\u20132\n|match_ADE_SYD= 0\u20131\n|match_ADE_WSW= 3\u20132\n\n|match_BRI_ADE= 3\u20132\n|match_BRI_CNU= 5\u20130\n|match_BRI_MCY= 0\u20132\n|match_BRI_MVC= 2\u20133\n|match_BRI_NEW= 2\u20131\n|match_BRI_PER= null\n|match_BRI_SYD= null\n|match_BRI_WSW= 1\u20133\n\n|match_CNU_ADE= 3\u20131\n|match_CNU_BRI= 1\u20132\n|match_CNU_MCY= 1\u20132\n|match_CNU_MVC= null\n|match_CNU_NEW= null\n|match_CNU_PER= 2\u20130\n|match_CNU_SYD= 0\u20134\n|match_CNU_WSW= 0\u20134\n\n|match_MCY_ADE= 1\u20130\n|match_MCY_BRI= 3\u20131\n|match_MCY_CNU= 4\u20130\n|match_MCY_MVC= [[Melbourne Derby (A-League)|1\u20130]]\n|match_MCY_NEW= 2\u20130\n|match_MCY_PER= 1\u20130\n|match_MCY_SYD= null\n|match_MCY_WSW= null\n\n|match_MVC_ADE= null\n|match_MVC_BRI= 0\u20130\n|match_MVC_CNU= 3\u20130\n|match_MVC_MCY= [[Melbourne Derby (A-League)|0\u20134]]\n|match_MVC_NEW= 2\u20131\n|match_MVC_PER= null\n|match_MVC_SYD= [[The Big Blue (A-League)|3\u20131]]\n|match_MVC_WSW= 1\u20131\n\n|match_NEW_ADE= 2\u20130\n|match_NEW_BRI= null\n|match_NEW_CNU= 2\u20133\n|match_NEW_MCY= 1\u20131\n|match_NEW_MVC= 0\u20137\n|match_NEW_PER= 2\u20134\n|match_NEW_SYD= 0\u20132\n|match_NEW_WSW= null\n\n|match_PER_ADE= null\n|match_PER_BRI= 4\u20132\n|match_PER_CNU= 1\u20131\n|match_PER_MCY= null\n|match_PER_MVC= 1\u20132\n|match_PER_NEW= 1\u20132\n|match_PER_SYD= 1\u20133\n|match_PER_WSW= 2\u20133\n\n|match_SYD_ADE= 2\u20130\n|match_SYD_BRI= 0\u20130\n|match_SYD_CNU= null\n|match_SYD_MCY= 1\u20132\n|match_SYD_MVC= [[The Big Blue (A-League)|3\u20130]]\n|match_SYD_NEW= null\n|match_SYD_PER= 1\u20132\n|match_SYD_WSW= [[Sydney Derby (A-League)|3\u20130]]\n\n|match_WSW_ADE= 2\u20131\n|match_WSW_BRI= 0\u20134\n|match_WSW_CNU= null\n|match_WSW_MCY= 0\u20134\n|match_WSW_MVC= null\n|match_WSW_NEW= 1\u20130\n|match_WSW_PER= 3\u20131\n|match_WSW_SYD= [[Sydney Derby (A-League)|5\u20130]]\n}}\n\n===Positions by round===\n{{#invoke:sports rbr table|table|sortable=y|legendpos=br\n\n|team1= [[Melbourne City FC (W-League)|Melbourne City]]\n| pos1= 4/3/3/2/1/1/2/1/1/1/1/1/1/1\n|team2= [[Melbourne Victory FC (W-League)|Melbourne Victory]]\n| pos2= 9/5/5/6/7/6/6/4/5/5/4/4/3/2\n|team3= [[Sydney FC (W-League)|Sydney FC]]\n| pos3= 1/1/1/3/2/3/3/3/2/3/3/2/2/3\n|team4= [[Western Sydney Wanderers FC (W-League)|Western Sydney Wanderers]]\n| pos4= 3/2/2/1/3/2/1/2/3/2/2/3/4/4\n|team5= [[Brisbane Roar FC (W-League)|Brisbane Roar]]\n| pos5= 6/7/7/7/5/5/4/5/4/4/5/5/5/5\n|team6= [[Canberra United FC|Canberra United]]\n| pos6= 2/4/4/4/4/4/5/6/6/6/6/6/6/6\n|team7= [[Perth Glory FC (W-League)|Perth Glory]]\n| pos7= 8/9/9/9/8/8/8/8/8/8/8/7/7/7\n|team8= [[Adelaide United FC (W-League)|Adelaide United]]\n| pos8= 7/8/8/8/9/9/9/9/9/9/9/9/9/8\n|team9= [[Newcastle Jets FC (W-League)|Newcastle Jets]]\n| pos9= 5/6/6/5/6/7/7/7/7/7/7/8/8/9\n\n| color_1=green1 |text_1= Leader and qualification to [[#Finals series|Finals series]]\n| color_2-4=green2 |text_2-4= Qualification to [[#Finals series|Finals series]]\n|source=[http://www.w-league.com.au/ladder w-league.com.au]\n|update=22 February 2020\n}}\n\n==Fixtures==\n\n===Round 1===\n{{footballbox collapsible\n|date       = 14 November 2019\n|team1      = [[Western Sydney Wanderers FC (W-League)|Western Sydney Wanderers]]\n|time       = 19:30 [[UTC+11:00|AEDT]]\n|score      = 2\u20131\n|report     = https://www.w-league.com.au/match/western-sydney-wanderers-fc-women-v-adelaide-united-women-w-league-14-11-2019/2032852\n|team2      = [[Adelaide United FC (W-League)|Adelaide United]]\n|goals1     = \n*[[Kristen Hamilton|Hamilton]] {{goal|44}}\n*[[Kyra Cooney-Cross|Cooney-Cross]] {{goal|90+2}}\n|goals2     = \n* [[Mary Fowler (soccer)|M.

Do NOT change to \"is\" Addl NOTE: only in Afrikaans; though traditional English is a minority language, it still is based on UK English--> a South African [[Rock music|rock]] band founded in 1999 in [[Pretoria]], [[Gauteng]]. The band originally performed under the name Saron Gas until 2002, when they moved to the United States and changed it to Seether to avoid confusion with the deadly chemical known as sarin gas.\n\nSeether gained mainstream popularity in 2002 with their US Active Rock number one single \"[[Fine Again]]\", and their success was sustained in 2004 with the single \"[[Broken (Seether song)|Broken]]\", which peaked at number 20 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. They have experienced continued success with number one hits on the [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart, such as \"[[Remedy (Seether song)|Remedy]]\", \"[[Fake It (Seether song)|Fake It]]\", \"[[Country Song (Seether song)|Country Song]]\", \"[[Words as Weapons (Seether song)|Words as Weapons]]\", and \"[[Let You Down (Seether song)|Let You Down]]\". The band currently consists of lead vocalist/guitarist [[Shaun Morgan]], bassist [[Dale Stewart]], drummer John Humphrey and guitarist [[Corey Lowery]]. Seether has undergone several changes since their formation in 1999, with vocalist/guitarist Shaun Morgan and bassist/vocalist Dale Stewart, being the only constant members while John Humphrey has been their longtime drummer since joining the band in 2003.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation as Saron Gas (1999\u20132001)===\nThe band formed in [[South Africa]] in May 1999 under the name Saron Gas.<ref name=\"AllMusicBio\">{{cite web|author=Bradley Torreano |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/seether-mn0000625731/biography |title=Seether &#124; Biography & History |website=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2020-03-19}}</ref> Consisting of [[frontman]], vocalist, and guitarist [[Shaun Morgan]], bassist Tyronne Morris (who left the band in December 1999 and was replaced by Dale Stewart in January 2000), and drummer Dave Cohoe, the band released their first album, ''Fragile'', in 2000 under [[Johannesburg]]-based [[independent record label]] Musketeer Records.<ref name=\"AllMusicBio\"/> Despite the region's focus primarily on [[pop music|pop]] and [[indigenous music]], the band found success, and eventually caught attention of American record label [[Wind-up Records]], who gave them a record deal to begin releasing music in [[North America]].<ref name=\"AllMusicBio\"/> Upon signing to the label, they were told they needed to change their name due to its similarity to [[sarin gas]], and switched to calling themselves [[Seether (song)|Seether]], after the [[Veruca Salt]] song.<ref name=\"AXS1\">[https://www.axs.com/seether-5-most-pivotal-moments-84248] {{dead link|date=March 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Disclaimer'' releases (2002\u20132004) ===\nIn August 2002, Seether launched their first official album, ''Disclaimer'', which earned the band three singles: \"[[Fine Again]]\", \"[[Driven Under]]\", and \"[[Gasoline (Seether song)|Gasoline]]\", in which only the first managed significant success. After the release of ''Disclaimer'', the band toured constantly. Near the end of the Disclaimer Tour, they decided to return to the studio to record their second album, a project that had to be delayed by almost a year, since at that time Seether was on a world tour with [[Evanescence]]. \"Fine Again\" was also included in the video games ''[[Madden NFL 2003]]'' in 2002 and ''[[1080\u00b0 Avalanche]]'' in 2003.\n\nFollowing the release of ''Disclaimer'', the band toured continually in order to increase sales and gain name recognition. A planned second album was delayed for nearly a year when Seether was selected as the support act for an [[Evanescence]] worldwide tour. Seether reworked their [[acoustic music|acoustic]] ballad \"[[Broken (Seether song)|Broken]]\" into an electric ballad with guest vocals by [[Amy Lee]] of Evanescence. Favourable audience response led the band to record the revised version, with Lee on vocals. The track, along with a new song entitled \"Sold Me\", was featured on the soundtrack for the 2004 film ''[[The Punisher (2004 film)|The Punisher]]'', and became a major success for the band, particularly in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. A romance developed between Lee and Morgan during this time.\n\nMorgan has stated that the reworking of \"Broken\" was due to the wishes of the record company rather than those of the band.<ref name=fastloud>{{cite web |url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/features/5323/ |title=Seether feels the cold on |publisher=Fasterlouder.com.au |date=18 July 2006 |accessdate=17 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011051304/http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/features/5323/ |archive-date=11 October 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> An alternate version of the original album, with many of its songs [[remix]]ed or re-recorded, was released in June 2004 and entitled ''[[Disclaimer II]]''.

Morgan had been suffering from a stomach ailment, and decided to do an acoustic performance of their set rather than cancel the show. The exclusion of \"Needles\" and \"Burrito\" from the album is due to the label's desire that it contain no obscenities.<ref>{{cite web|title=Seether|url=http://www.frontrowking.com/seether-tickets/index.html|publisher=Frontrowking.com|accessdate=8 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nGuitarist [[Patrick Callahan]]'s departure from the band was announced in June 15, 2006.

Pat also did not like certain band decisions. One example was the band being on the Punisher and Daredevil soundtrack in which he did not like the lineup of bands they were associated with. [[Shaun Morgan]] himself later commented on Pat's departure:\n:\"''Um... relieved a little... actually a lot. He was the guy in the band that was always our naysayer, and he was the negative energy as far as writing. I personally have no love lost, which is weird for some reason 'cause he was my friend for four years. But when he walked out, it kinda walked out with him.''\"<ref name=fastloud/>\n\nMorgan entered a rehabilitation program for what he felt was \"dependence on a combination of substances\" in August 2006, which forced the band to cancel a tour with [[Staind]] and [[Three Days Grace]].<ref name=\"MTV2007\">{{cite web |title=Seether Frontman Enters Rehab; August Tour Dates Canceled - MTV |author=Chris Harris |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1537141/seether-frontman-enters-rehab-august-tour-dates-canceled/ |date=26 Jul 2006 |accessdate=15 Sep 2019}}</ref>\n\n===''Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces'' (2007\u20132009)===\nShaun Morgan, prior to the next album's release, claimed that it would be more diverse than previous efforts. ''[[Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces]]'' was slated for an August 2007 release but was delayed until 23 October 2007 due to the [[suicide]] of Morgan's brother, Eugene Welgemoed. The album debuted at number 9 in the Billboard 200 album charts, and sold 57,000 copies in its first week. Its cover artwork featured \"Candice the Ghost\", and was illustrated by [[David Ho (artist)|David Ho]]. The first single, \"[[Fake It (Seether song)|Fake It]]\", reached the top position of the US Mainstream Rock Charts and Modern Rock Charts, and held that spot for at least 9 weeks on both charts. It became the theme for [[WWE]]'s [[No Way Out (2008)]]. \"[[Rise Above This]]\", written for Eugene Welgemoed, was released as a single and reached the No.&nbsp;1 spot on the [[Modern Rock Tracks]] chart and No.&nbsp;2 on its mainstream counterpart.{{Clarify|date=July 2012}} The final single from the album was \"Breakdown\", the video for which was released on 12 November 2008 after a delay from its original scheduled release date of October 23. ''Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces'' won Seether's first [[South African Music Awards|South African Music Award]] in the category \"Best Rock: English\", as well as their first [[MTV Africa Music Awards|MTV Africa Music Award]] for \"Best Alternative Artist\".\n\nA tour launched in support of the album in early 2008 lasted much of the year. [[Troy McLawhorn]] of [[Dark New Day]], [[Evanescence]], and [[doubleDrive]] was hired as a touring guitarist on 15 February 2008.

Do NOT change to \"is\" Addl NOTE: only in Afrikaans; though traditional English is a minority language, it still is based on UK English--> a South African [[Rock music|rock]] band founded in 1999 in [[Pretoria]], [[Gauteng]]. The band originally performed under the name Saron Gas until 2002, when they moved to the United States and changed it to Seether to avoid confusion with the deadly chemical known as sarin gas.\n\nSeether gained mainstream popularity in 2002 with their US Active Rock number one single \"[[Fine Again]]\", and their success was sustained in 2004 with the single \"[[Broken (Seether song)|Broken]]\", which peaked at number 20 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. They have experienced continued success with number one hits on the [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart, such as \"[[Remedy (Seether song)|Remedy]]\", \"[[Fake It (Seether song)|Fake It]]\", \"[[Country Song (Seether song)|Country Song]]\", \"[[Words as Weapons (Seether song)|Words as Weapons]]\", and \"[[Let You Down (Seether song)|Let You Down]]\". The band currently consists of lead vocalist/guitarist [[Shaun Morgan]], bassist [[Dale Stewart]], drummer John Humphrey and guitarist [[Corey Lowery]]. Seether has undergone several changes since their formation in 1999, with vocalist/guitarist Shaun Morgan and bassist/vocalist Dale Stewart, being the only constant members while John Humphrey has been their longtime drummer since joining the band in 2003.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation as Saron Gas (1999\u20132001)===\nThe band formed in [[South Africa]] in May 1999 under the name Saron Gas.<ref name=\"AllMusicBio\">{{cite web|author=Bradley Torreano |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/seether-mn0000625731/biography |title=Seether &#124; Biography & History |website=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2020-03-19}}</ref> Consisting of [[frontman]], vocalist, and guitarist [[Shaun Morgan]], bassist Tyronne Morris (who left the band in December 1999 and was replaced by Dale Stewart in January 2000), and drummer Dave Cohoe, the band released their first album, ''Fragile'', in 2000 under [[Johannesburg]]-based [[independent record label]] Musketeer Records.<ref name=\"AllMusicBio\"/> Despite the region's focus primarily on [[pop music|pop]] and [[indigenous music]], the band found success, and eventually caught attention of American record label [[Wind-up Records]], who gave them a record deal to begin releasing music in [[North America]].<ref name=\"AllMusicBio\"/> Upon signing to the label, they were told they needed to change their name due to its similarity to [[sarin gas]], and switched to calling themselves [[Seether (song)|Seether]], after the [[Veruca Salt]] song.<ref name=\"AXS1\">[https://www.axs.com/seether-5-most-pivotal-moments-84248] {{dead link|date=March 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Disclaimer'' releases (2002\u20132004) ===\nIn August 2002, Seether launched their first official album, ''Disclaimer'', which earned the band three singles: \"[[Fine Again]]\", \"[[Driven Under]]\", and \"[[Gasoline (Seether song)|Gasoline]]\", in which only the first managed significant success. After the release of ''Disclaimer'', the band toured constantly. Near the end of the Disclaimer Tour, they decided to return to the studio to record their second album, a project that had to be delayed by almost a year, since at that time Seether was on a world tour with [[Evanescence]]. \"Fine Again\" was also included in the video games ''[[Madden NFL 2003]]'' in 2002 and ''[[1080\u00b0 Avalanche]]'' in 2003.\n\nFollowing the release of ''Disclaimer'', the band toured continually in order to increase sales and gain name recognition. A planned second album was delayed for nearly a year when Seether was selected as the support act for an [[Evanescence]] worldwide tour. Seether reworked their [[acoustic music|acoustic]] ballad \"[[Broken (Seether song)|Broken]]\" into an electric ballad with guest vocals by [[Amy Lee]] of Evanescence. Favourable audience response led the band to record the revised version, with Lee on vocals. The track, along with a new song entitled \"Sold Me\", was featured on the soundtrack for the 2004 film ''[[The Punisher (2004 film)|The Punisher]]'', and became a major success for the band, particularly in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. A romance developed between Lee and Morgan during this time.\n\nMorgan has stated that the reworking of \"Broken\" was due to the wishes of the record company rather than those of the band.<ref name=fastloud>{{cite web |url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/features/5323/ |title=Seether feels the cold on |publisher=Fasterlouder.com.au |date=18 July 2006 |accessdate=17 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011051304/http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/features/5323/ |archive-date=11 October 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> An alternate version of the original album, with many of its songs [[remix]]ed or re-recorded, was released in June 2004 and entitled ''[[Disclaimer II]]''. The alternate version also featured eight extra tracks.\n\n===''Karma and Effect'' (2005\u20132006)===\nSeether's follow-up album, ''[[Karma and Effect]]'', was released in May 2005. Originally titled ''Catering to Cowards'', the name was changed at the record label's demand.<ref name=vh1>{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1501650/20050511/seether.jhtml |title=Seether : Seether Frontman Shaun Morgan Is Very Angry |publisher=VH1.com |accessdate=17 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901033029/http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1501650/20050511/seether.jhtml |archivedate=1 September 2009 }}</ref> ''Karma and Effect'' debuted at number 8 on the US Billboard 200 album charts and was certified gold in the US and Canada. The album spawned three singles, \"[[Remedy (Seether song)|Remedy]]\", \"[[Truth (Seether song)|Truth]]\", and \"[[The Gift (Seether song)|The Gift]]\". \"Remedy\" reached number 1 on the US Mainstream Rock Charts, Seether's first number 1 hit.\n\nSeether released an acoustic CD/DVD set titled ''[[One Cold Night]]'', recorded at the Grape Street Club in [[Philadelphia]], on 22 February 2006. Morgan had been suffering from a stomach ailment, and decided to do an acoustic performance of their set rather than cancel the show. The exclusion of \"Needles\" and \"Burrito\" from the album is due to the label's desire that it contain no obscenities.<ref>{{cite web|title=Seether|url=http://www.frontrowking.com/seether-tickets/index.html|publisher=Frontrowking.com|accessdate=8 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nGuitarist [[Patrick Callahan]]'s departure from the band was announced in June 15, 2006.

Pat also did not like certain band decisions. One example was the band being on the Punisher and Daredevil soundtrack in which he did not like the lineup of bands they were associated with. [[Shaun Morgan]] himself later commented on Pat's departure:\n:\"''Um... relieved a little... actually a lot. He was the guy in the band that was always our naysayer, and he was the negative energy as far as writing. I personally have no love lost, which is weird for some reason 'cause he was my friend for four years. But when he walked out, it kinda walked out with him.''\"<ref name=fastloud/>\n\nMorgan entered a rehabilitation program for what he felt was \"dependence on a combination of substances\" in August 2006, which forced the band to cancel a tour with [[Staind]] and [[Three Days Grace]].<ref name=\"MTV2007\">{{cite web |title=Seether Frontman Enters Rehab; August Tour Dates Canceled - MTV |author=Chris Harris |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1537141/seether-frontman-enters-rehab-august-tour-dates-canceled/ |date=26 Jul 2006 |accessdate=15 Sep 2019}}</ref>\n\n===''Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces'' (2007\u20132009)===\nShaun Morgan, prior to the next album's release, claimed that it would be more diverse than previous efforts. ''[[Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces]]'' was slated for an August 2007 release but was delayed until 23 October 2007 due to the [[suicide]] of Morgan's brother, Eugene Welgemoed. The album debuted at number 9 in the Billboard 200 album charts, and sold 57,000 copies in its first week. Its cover artwork featured \"Candice the Ghost\", and was illustrated by [[David Ho (artist)|David Ho]]. The first single, \"[[Fake It (Seether song)|Fake It]]\", reached the top position of the US Mainstream Rock Charts and Modern Rock Charts, and held that spot for at least 9 weeks on both charts. It became the theme for [[WWE]]'s [[No Way Out (2008)]]. \"[[Rise Above This]]\", written for Eugene Welgemoed, was released as a single and reached the No.&nbsp;1 spot on the [[Modern Rock Tracks]] chart and No.&nbsp;2 on its mainstream counterpart.{{Clarify|date=July 2012}} The final single from the album was \"Breakdown\", the video for which was released on 12 November 2008 after a delay from its original scheduled release date of October 23. ''Finding Beauty in Negative Spaces'' won Seether's first [[South African Music Awards|South African Music Award]] in the category \"Best Rock: English\", as well as their first [[MTV Africa Music Awards|MTV Africa Music Award]] for \"Best Alternative Artist\".\n\nA tour launched in support of the album in early 2008 lasted much of the year. [[Troy McLawhorn]] of [[Dark New Day]], [[Evanescence]], and [[doubleDrive]] was hired as a touring guitarist on 15 February 2008.

His films are particularly noted for their rich use of colour, as can be seen in some of his early films, like ''[[Raise the Red Lantern]]'', and in his [[wuxia]] films like ''[[Hero (2002 film)|Hero]]'' and ''[[House of Flying Daggers]]''. His highest budgeted film to date is the 2016 [[monster film]] ''[[The Great Wall (film)|The Great Wall]]'', set in [[History of China|Imperial China]] and starring [[Matt Damon]].\n\n==Early life==\nZhang was born Zhang Yimou ({{zh|s=\u5f20\u8bd2\u8c0b|p=|labels=no}}) in [[Xi'an]], the capital of [[Shaanxi]] province.

Though originally intended to work as director's assistants, the graduates soon discovered there was a dearth of directors so soon after the Cultural Revolution, and gained permission to start making their own films. This led to the production of Zhang Junzhao's ''[[One and Eight]]'', on which Zhang Yimou worked as director of photography, and Chen Kaige's ''[[Yellow Earth]]'', in 1984. These two films were successes at the [[Hong Kong Film Festival]] and helped to bring the new Chinese cinema to the attention of worldwide audiences, signaling a departure from the earlier propagandist films of the Cultural Revolution.<ref name=Farquhar/><ref name=NYTimesCrow/> ''Yellow Earth'' is today widely considered the inaugural film of the Fifth Generation directors.<ref name=NYTimesCrow/><ref>{{Cite web | url = http://chinesecinema.ucsd.edu/essay_ccwlc.html | title = A Centennial Review of Chinese Cinema | accessdate = 21 August 2008 | date = 10 October 2003 | author = Zhang Yingjin | publisher = The University of California, San Diego | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080907160026/http://chinesecinema.ucsd.edu/essay_ccwlc.html | archivedate = 7 September 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.llc.ed.ac.uk/cinema-china/briefhistory.html| title = A Brief History of Chinese Film| accessdate = 21 August 2008| publisher = The University of Edinburgh-Cinema China '07| url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080606005732/http://www.llc.ed.ac.uk/cinema-china/briefhistory.html| archivedate = 6 June 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn 1985, after moving back to his home town of Xi'an, Zhang was engaged as cinematographer and lead actor for director [[Wu Tianming]]'s upcoming film ''[[Old Well (film)|Old Well]]'', which was subsequently released in 1987.

His films are particularly noted for their rich use of colour, as can be seen in some of his early films, like ''[[Raise the Red Lantern]]'', and in his [[wuxia]] films like ''[[Hero (2002 film)|Hero]]'' and ''[[House of Flying Daggers]]''. His highest budgeted film to date is the 2016 [[monster film]] ''[[The Great Wall (film)|The Great Wall]]'', set in [[History of China|Imperial China]] and starring [[Matt Damon]].\n\n==Early life==\nZhang was born Zhang Yimou ({{zh|s=\u5f20\u8bd2\u8c0b|p=|labels=no}}) in [[Xi'an]], the capital of [[Shaanxi]] province.

Though originally intended to work as director's assistants, the graduates soon discovered there was a dearth of directors so soon after the Cultural Revolution, and gained permission to start making their own films. This led to the production of Zhang Junzhao's ''[[One and Eight]]'', on which Zhang Yimou worked as director of photography, and Chen Kaige's ''[[Yellow Earth]]'', in 1984. These two films were successes at the [[Hong Kong Film Festival]] and helped to bring the new Chinese cinema to the attention of worldwide audiences, signaling a departure from the earlier propagandist films of the Cultural Revolution.<ref name=Farquhar/><ref name=NYTimesCrow/> ''Yellow Earth'' is today widely considered the inaugural film of the Fifth Generation directors.<ref name=NYTimesCrow/><ref>{{Cite web | url = http://chinesecinema.ucsd.edu/essay_ccwlc.html | title = A Centennial Review of Chinese Cinema | accessdate = 21 August 2008 | date = 10 October 2003 | author = Zhang Yingjin | publisher = The University of California, San Diego | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080907160026/http://chinesecinema.ucsd.edu/essay_ccwlc.html | archivedate = 7 September 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| url = http://www.llc.ed.ac.uk/cinema-china/briefhistory.html| title = A Brief History of Chinese Film| accessdate = 21 August 2008| publisher = The University of Edinburgh-Cinema China '07| url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080606005732/http://www.llc.ed.ac.uk/cinema-china/briefhistory.html| archivedate = 6 June 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn 1985, after moving back to his home town of Xi'an, Zhang was engaged as cinematographer and lead actor for director [[Wu Tianming]]'s upcoming film ''[[Old Well (film)|Old Well]]'', which was subsequently released in 1987.

With an impressive lineup of Asian stars, including [[Jet Li]], [[Maggie Cheung]], [[Tony Leung Chiu-Wai]], [[Zhang Ziyi]], and [[Donnie Yen]], ''Hero'' told a fictional tale about Ying Zheng, the King of the [[State of Qin]] (later to become the first [[Qin Shi Huang|Emperor of China]]), and his would-be assassins. The film was released in North America in 2004, two years after its Chinese release, by American distributor [[Miramax Films]], and became a huge international hit. ''Hero'' was one of the few foreign-language films to debut at number 1 at the U.S. box office,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9401E4DA1F3EF933A0575BC0A9629C8B63|title= Kung Fu Power for 'Hero' at Box Office|newspaper = [[The New York Times]] |date= 30 August 2004| accessdate=21 August 2008}}</ref> and was one of the nominees for Best Foreign Language Film at the [[75th Academy Awards|2003 Academy Awards]].\n\nZhang followed up the huge success of ''Hero'' with another martial arts epic, ''[[House of Flying Daggers]]'', in 2004.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,501040419-610119,00.html|title=Zhang Yimou Interview| magazine = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |author = Gough, Neil| date =12 April 2004|accessdate=21 August 2008}}</ref> Set in the [[Tang Dynasty]], it starred [[Zhang Ziyi]], [[Andy Lau]], and [[Takeshi Kaneshiro]] as characters caught in a dangerous love triangle.

In the United Kingdom, ''custard'' has various traditional recipes some thickened principally with cornflour (cornstarch) rather than the egg component, others involving regular flour; see [[custard powder]].\n\nAfter the custard has thickened, it may be mixed with other ingredients: mixed with stiffly beaten [[egg whites]] and [[gelatin]], it is [[chiboust cream]]; mixed with [[whipped cream]], it is ''cr\u00e8me l\u00e9g\u00e8re'', {{IPA-fr|k\u0281\u025bm le\u0292\u025b\u02d0\u0281|}}.

In the United Kingdom, ''custard'' has various traditional recipes some thickened principally with cornflour (cornstarch) rather than the egg component, others involving regular flour; see [[custard powder]].\n\nAfter the custard has thickened, it may be mixed with other ingredients: mixed with stiffly beaten [[egg whites]] and [[gelatin]], it is [[chiboust cream]]; mixed with [[whipped cream]], it is ''cr\u00e8me l\u00e9g\u00e8re'', {{IPA-fr|k\u0281\u025bm le\u0292\u025b\u02d0\u0281|}}.

Set in [[Guangzhou|Canton]], [[History of the Republic of China|Republic of China]] during the years of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], it follows the lives of Lau Sing and Cheng Kau-mui, who go against all odds to protect their families from the violence of war.\n\n''No Regrets'' is the [[Spiritual successor|companion piece]] of ''[[Rosy Business]]'' (2009). It premiered on [[TVB Jade|Jade]] and HD Jade networks from 18 October 2010 and aired for 32 episodes, with the final two episodes airing back-to-back on 28 November 2010. It was one of two anniversary dramas used to celebrate TVB's 43rd anniversary in 2010, the other being ''[[Gun Metal Grey]]''. Both dramas were the first Hong Kong dramas to broadcast live with English subtitles. \n\nThe drama received critical acclaim during its broadcast, and is the second [[List of TVB dramas in 2010|highest-rated television drama in 2010]]. The final episode peaked at 47 TVRs with 3.43 million live viewers, becoming Hong Kong's most-watched episode of the 2010s decade. ''No Regrets'' received multiple awards at the [[TVB Anniversary Awards]], including [[TVB Anniversary Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] ([[Wayne Lai]]), [[TVB Anniversary Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] ([[Sheren Tang]]), [[TVB Anniversary Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] ([[Mak Cheung-ching]]), [[TVB Anniversary Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] ([[Fala Chen]]), and [[TVB Anniversary Award for Most Improved Male Artiste|Most Improved Actor]] ([[Raymond Wong Ho-yin]]).\n\n==Premise==\nSet in the late 1930s to late 1940s in [[Guangzhou|Canton]], [[History of the Republic of China|Republic of China]] during [[World War II]], ''No Regrets'' is an [[Epic film|epic]] drama that centers on a [[triad (underground society)|triad family]], the Canton police force, and the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese occupation]] of the city. The Chinese title of ''No Regrets'' (\u5dfe\u5e57\u689f\u96c4\u4e4b\u7fa9\u6d77\u8c6a\u60c5) literally translates to \"Veiled Heroine, Ruthless Hero: Righteous Sea, Heroic Passion\", referring to both the chaotic period of war and the complicated relationship shared by the two main characters, Cheng Kau-mui ([[Sheren Tang]]) and Lau Sing ([[Wayne Lai]]). The drama and cast received eleven [[TVB Anniversary Awards|TVB Anniversary Award]] nominations, winning five of them. The awards include [[TVB Anniversary Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for Tang (who also won Best Actress for ''Rosy Business''), [[TVB Anniversary Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Lai (who also won Best Actor for ''Rosy Business''), [[TVB Anniversary Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for [[Fala Chen]], [[TVB Anniversary Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for [[Mak Cheung-ching]], and [[TVB Anniversary Award for Most Improved Male Artiste|Most Improved Male Artiste]] for [[Raymond Wong Ho-yin]].

Gangsters are on a rampage and opium trading becomes rampant. As they watch the illicit profits from opium trading escalate, the government forms the Anti-Smoking Bureau under the guise of suppressing opium, but the bureau is under the influence of Cheng Long-kwan ([[Elliot Ngok]]), the gang's kingpin. His eldest daughter Cheng Kau-mui ([[Sheren Tang]]) who is an unscrupulous person soon returns from Shanghai to reap the rewards. Mui meticulously plans her every move.\n\nOn the other hand, Lau Sing ([[Wayne Lai]]) is the leader of the Criminal Investigation Team. He has worked hard all his life to ensure an easy trail for his family. Despite his hot temper, he values friendship and brotherhood more than anything else. Once, he almost sacrificed his life to help his timid teammate, Spareribs ([[Ngo Ka-nin]]).\n\nMeanwhile, the Japanese army invades China and Canton falls into the hands of the Japanese. Mui enters the darkest time in her life when her aunt Cheng Long-hei ([[Susan Tse]]) frames her.\n\n==Production==\n===Development and filming===\nAfter the critical and popular success of ''Rosy Business'', TVB decided to produce a sequel for the drama. Most of the original main cast signed on to film the sequel, with the exception of [[Kiki Sheung]], [[Ron Ng]], and [[Suki Chui]], who were reported to be not taking part in the production due to schedule conflicts. While the production was labeled as a sequel, the term was only a [[namesake]]. [[Wayne Lai]], who portrayed [[List of Rosy Business characters#Chai Kau|Chai Kau]] in the predecessor, expressed that he would not film a sequel to ''Rosy Business'': \"I do not wish [to film a sequel].

On the other hand, people felt that the romance between the second leads was dry and draggy.<ref>{{cite news|title=No Regrets gets good reception - Finale touches viewers|url=http://dailynews.sina.com/bg/ent/tv/sinacn/20101130/01182041726.html|accessdate=2011-08-01|newspaper=Yangcheng Wanbao|date=2010-11-30|language=Chinese}}</ref> The drama was praised for being 'fresh' as it is not often that one gets to see war, rivalry, love for one's country and even history in a Hong Kong drama. Also, the style of directing, editing and even the music have gone way beyond the standard of Hong Kong dramas, with many people liking it to an epic movie.<ref>{{cite news|title=My Critic on No Regrets|url=http://hi.baidu.com/33lpmhk/blog/item/1b92d014db59de0e203f2e74.html|accessdate=2011-08-01|newspaper=Headline News|date=2010-11-30|language=Chinese}}</ref> The acting skills of Sheren Tang, Wayne Lai, Ngo Ka-nin were praised for being versatile and vastly different from their characters in the prequel, Rosy Business. Mak Cheung-ching was also given credit for playing such a hated character so convincingly that his catch-phrase \"My name Leung Fei Fan will be written backwards!\" was widely used. There were many people playing the role of Japanese soldiers in No Regrets. They did not have any Japanese background, but persevered in using Japanese to film their scenes. Their professionalism has won the praise of both the viewers and producer himself.<ref>{{cite news|title=Small roles in No Regrets steal attention|url=http://www.baby-kingdom.com/forum.php?mod=viewthread&tid=3559415|accessdate=2011-08-01|newspaper=Apple Daily|date=2010-11-30|language=Chinese}}</ref>\n\nHowever, some netizens found that the props used in that era were not right and did not really bring out the chaotic times of that era. The drama's female lead, Tang, has also lambasted TVB for stinging on production values, which made the set look unconvincing.<ref>{{cite news|title=Why Hong Kong actors are going to Mainland - Sheren Tang explains|url=http://ent.sina.com.cn/v/h/2011-05-10/07033303655.shtml|accessdate=2011-08-01|newspaper=Southern Metropolis Daily|date=2011-05-10|language=Chinese}}</ref>\n\nThe finale episode had 3 million Hong Kong TV viewers, and resulted in an unprecedented zero share of ratings for rival [[Asia Television]], which was airing a gospel programme at the time.<ref>{{cite news|title=3 million tuned in for \"No Regrets\" finale.

Each episode attracted more than 1 million clicks on average.\n\nIt also received the best rating in Guangzhou, with 1,710,000 viewers and 60% share of ratings; the runner-up had 5%.\n\nAfter winning the Best Actor and Best Actress awards for [[Rosy Business]], [[Wayne Lai]] and [[Sheren Tang]] successfully defended their titles based on their brilliant performance in this drama respectively. Lai became the second actor to win the Best Actor award consecutively after [[Gallen Lo]] in 1997 and 1998, while Tang became the first actress in TVB to win the Best Actress award consecutively. Both of them became the first ever couple in TVB's history to win the awards consecutively based on the same drama franchise.\n\nAfter sweeping the main acting awards in the 2010 TVB Anniversary Awards ceremony, ''No Regrets'' was expected to take home the Best Drama award. However, the award went to [[Can't Buy Me Love (TV series)|Can't Buy Me Love]] unexpectedly, shocking everybody who was present. Complaints were lodged immediately after the ceremony ended, with many people saying that No Regrets should have won because of its high ratings as well as critical acclaim it had garnered during its broadcast.<ref>{{cite news|title=No Regrets loses Best Drama award.

The proposed drama, tentatively named as ''Rosy Business III'', was slated to start filming in April 2012.<ref>{{cite news|title=Rosy Business series cast to reunite|url=http://ent.qq.com/a/20110805/000089.htm|accessdate=2011-08-05|newspaper=\u817e\u8baf\u5a31\u4e50 |date=2011-08-05|language=Chinese}}</ref> Although plans for it have fallen through as the drama's script-editor, Cheung Wah Biu, would not be returning to TVB,<ref>{{cite news|title=Rosy Business 3 falls through|url=http://www.ihktv.com/mingpaoweekly-2235-rosy3.html|accessdate=2011-09-20|newspaper=Mingpao Weekly |date=2011-09-10|language=Chinese}}</ref> there will be another script-editor, Ip Kwong-yam, to helm the script and the plans were resumed, with the new female leading role as [[Myolie Wu]]. Filming for Rosy Business III began in March 2013.\n\n==Historical elements==\nThe [[period drama]] follows the lives of fictional characters in the Chinese [[city]] of [[Guangzhou|Canton]] between 1936 and 1949. With [[Wayne Lai]] portraying the righteous police officer Lau Sing and [[Sheren Tang]] portraying a goodwilled daughter of a [[Triad (underground society)|triad]] boss holding a facade to save people, ''No Regrets'' includes some of the biggest issues and historical events during the time when the drama is set. It has a focus on [[opium]], the [[drug]] that many [[China|Chinese]] people were addicted to at the time, supplied by notorious dealers. The [[police force]] were corrupt and feared the triads, and this is portrayed in the drama.\n\nThen ''No Regrets'' focuses on the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese Occupation]] of China in 1937, and portrays the lives of the Chinese during the Occupation. After the defeat of the [[Japanese Imperial Army]] in the 1945, [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]] ensues, which, as portrayed at the latter part of the drama, affects the triads and directly affects Miss Kau; she held a facade as a ruthless opium dealer and a woman who cooperated with the [[Japanese Imperial Army]] for an opium business, when the new government of the [[Chinese Communist Party]] takes control of the [[People's Republic of China]].\n\nThe period drama therefore portrays life in Canton before the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]] during the mid-1930s, the Japanese Occupation between 1937 and 1945, the civil war and the establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]] which brings the drama to a climax as the leads who share a romantic relationship are split apart. Miss Kau, a former notorious drug dealer and \"traitor\" to the country, flies to [[Honolulu]] via [[Hong Kong]], and Lau Sing, who, after a twist of fate, remains within [[Mainland China]] with [[amnesia]], joins the [[Korean War]] of the early 1950s, restores his memory and attempts unsuccessfully to swim to [[Hong Kong]] and leave for [[Honolulu]] to seek his beloved Miss Kau after the gates were closed between Mainland China and Hong Kong. The drama concludes with Miss Kau and Lau Sing reuniting in 1979 in Canton, and living life together in the early 1980s in Hong Kong and in traveling.\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!

Set in [[Guangzhou|Canton]], [[History of the Republic of China|Republic of China]] during the years of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], it follows the lives of Lau Sing and Cheng Kau-mui, who go against all odds to protect their families from the violence of war.\n\n''No Regrets'' is the [[Spiritual successor|companion piece]] of ''[[Rosy Business]]'' (2009). It premiered on [[TVB Jade|Jade]] and HD Jade networks from 18 October 2010 and aired for 32 episodes, with the final two episodes airing back-to-back on 28 November 2010. It was one of two anniversary dramas used to celebrate TVB's 43rd anniversary in 2010, the other being ''[[Gun Metal Grey]]''. Both dramas were the first Hong Kong dramas to broadcast live with English subtitles. \n\nThe drama received critical acclaim during its broadcast, and is the second [[List of TVB dramas in 2010|highest-rated television drama in 2010]]. The final episode peaked at 47 TVRs with 3.43 million live viewers, becoming Hong Kong's most-watched episode of the 2010s decade. ''No Regrets'' received multiple awards at the [[TVB Anniversary Awards]], including [[TVB Anniversary Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] ([[Wayne Lai]]), [[TVB Anniversary Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] ([[Sheren Tang]]), [[TVB Anniversary Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] ([[Mak Cheung-ching]]), [[TVB Anniversary Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] ([[Fala Chen]]), and [[TVB Anniversary Award for Most Improved Male Artiste|Most Improved Actor]] ([[Raymond Wong Ho-yin]]).\n\n==Premise==\nSet in the late 1930s to late 1940s in [[Guangzhou|Canton]], [[History of the Republic of China|Republic of China]] during [[World War II]], ''No Regrets'' is an [[Epic film|epic]] drama that centers on a [[triad (underground society)|triad family]], the Canton police force, and the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese occupation]] of the city. The Chinese title of ''No Regrets'' (\u5dfe\u5e57\u689f\u96c4\u4e4b\u7fa9\u6d77\u8c6a\u60c5) literally translates to \"Veiled Heroine, Ruthless Hero: Righteous Sea, Heroic Passion\", referring to both the chaotic period of war and the complicated relationship shared by the two main characters, Cheng Kau-mui ([[Sheren Tang]]) and Lau Sing ([[Wayne Lai]]). The drama and cast received eleven [[TVB Anniversary Awards|TVB Anniversary Award]] nominations, winning five of them. The awards include [[TVB Anniversary Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for Tang (who also won Best Actress for ''Rosy Business''), [[TVB Anniversary Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Lai (who also won Best Actor for ''Rosy Business''), [[TVB Anniversary Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for [[Fala Chen]], [[TVB Anniversary Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for [[Mak Cheung-ching]], and [[TVB Anniversary Award for Most Improved Male Artiste|Most Improved Male Artiste]] for [[Raymond Wong Ho-yin]].

Gangsters are on a rampage and opium trading becomes rampant. As they watch the illicit profits from opium trading escalate, the government forms the Anti-Smoking Bureau under the guise of suppressing opium, but the bureau is under the influence of Cheng Long-kwan ([[Elliot Ngok]]), the gang's kingpin. His eldest daughter Cheng Kau-mui ([[Sheren Tang]]) who is an unscrupulous person soon returns from Shanghai to reap the rewards. Mui meticulously plans her every move.\n\nOn the other hand, Lau Sing ([[Wayne Lai]]) is the leader of the Criminal Investigation Team. He has worked hard all his life to ensure an easy trail for his family. Despite his hot temper, he values friendship and brotherhood more than anything else. Once, he almost sacrificed his life to help his timid teammate, Spareribs ([[Ngo Ka-nin]]).\n\nMeanwhile, the Japanese army invades China and Canton falls into the hands of the Japanese. Mui enters the darkest time in her life when her aunt Cheng Long-hei ([[Susan Tse]]) frames her.\n\n==Production==\n===Development and filming===\nAfter the critical and popular success of ''Rosy Business'', TVB decided to produce a sequel for the drama. Most of the original main cast signed on to film the sequel, with the exception of [[Kiki Sheung]], [[Ron Ng]], and [[Suki Chui]], who were reported to be not taking part in the production due to schedule conflicts. While the production was labeled as a sequel, the term was only a [[namesake]]. [[Wayne Lai]], who portrayed [[List of Rosy Business characters#Chai Kau|Chai Kau]] in the predecessor, expressed that he would not film a sequel to ''Rosy Business'': \"I do not wish [to film a sequel].

There were many people playing the role of Japanese soldiers in No Regrets. They did not have any Japanese background, but persevered in using Japanese to film their scenes. Their professionalism has won the praise of both the viewers and producer himself.<ref>{{cite news|title=Small roles in No Regrets steal attention|url=http://www.baby-kingdom.com/forum.php?mod=viewthread&tid=3559415|accessdate=2011-08-01|newspaper=Apple Daily|date=2010-11-30|language=Chinese}}</ref>\n\nHowever, some netizens found that the props used in that era were not right and did not really bring out the chaotic times of that era.

Lai became the second actor to win the Best Actor award consecutively after [[Gallen Lo]] in 1997 and 1998, while Tang became the first actress in TVB to win the Best Actress award consecutively. Both of them became the first ever couple in TVB's history to win the awards consecutively based on the same drama franchise.\n\nAfter sweeping the main acting awards in the 2010 TVB Anniversary Awards ceremony, ''No Regrets'' was expected to take home the Best Drama award. However, the award went to [[Can't Buy Me Love (TV series)|Can't Buy Me Love]] unexpectedly, shocking everybody who was present. Complaints were lodged immediately after the ceremony ended, with many people saying that No Regrets should have won because of its high ratings as well as critical acclaim it had garnered during its broadcast.<ref>{{cite news|title=No Regrets loses Best Drama award.

Filming for Rosy Business III began in March 2013.\n\n==Historical elements==\nThe [[period drama]] follows the lives of fictional characters in the Chinese [[city]] of [[Guangzhou|Canton]] between 1936 and 1949. With [[Wayne Lai]] portraying the righteous police officer Lau Sing and [[Sheren Tang]] portraying a goodwilled daughter of a [[Triad (underground society)|triad]] boss holding a facade to save people, ''No Regrets'' includes some of the biggest issues and historical events during the time when the drama is set. It has a focus on [[opium]], the [[drug]] that many [[China|Chinese]] people were addicted to at the time, supplied by notorious dealers. The [[police force]] were corrupt and feared the triads, and this is portrayed in the drama.\n\nThen ''No Regrets'' focuses on the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese Occupation]] of China in 1937, and portrays the lives of the Chinese during the Occupation. After the defeat of the [[Japanese Imperial Army]] in the 1945, [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]] ensues, which, as portrayed at the latter part of the drama, affects the triads and directly affects Miss Kau; she held a facade as a ruthless opium dealer and a woman who cooperated with the [[Japanese Imperial Army]] for an opium business, when the new government of the [[Chinese Communist Party]] takes control of the [[People's Republic of China]].\n\nThe period drama therefore portrays life in Canton before the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]] during the mid-1930s, the Japanese Occupation between 1937 and 1945, the civil war and the establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]] which brings the drama to a climax as the leads who share a romantic relationship are split apart. Miss Kau, a former notorious drug dealer and \"traitor\" to the country, flies to [[Honolulu]] via [[Hong Kong]], and Lau Sing, who, after a twist of fate, remains within [[Mainland China]] with [[amnesia]], joins the [[Korean War]] of the early 1950s, restores his memory and attempts unsuccessfully to swim to [[Hong Kong]] and leave for [[Honolulu]] to seek his beloved Miss Kau after the gates were closed between Mainland China and Hong Kong. The drama concludes with Miss Kau and Lau Sing reuniting in 1979 in Canton, and living life together in the early 1980s in Hong Kong and in traveling.\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!

A political ideology largely concerns itself with how to allocate [[Power (sociology)|power]] and to what ends it should be used. Some [[Political party|political parties]] follow a certain ideology very closely while others may take broad inspiration from a group of related ideologies without specifically embracing any one of them. The popularity of an ideology is in part due to the influence of [[moral entrepreneur]]s, who sometimes act in their own interests. Political ideologies have two dimensions: (1) goals: how society should be organized; and (2) methods: the most appropriate way to achieve this goal.\n\nAn ideology is a collection of ideas. Typically, each ideology contains certain ideas on what it considers to be the best [[Forms of government|form of government]] (e.g. [[autocracy]] or [[democracy]]) and the best [[economic system]] (e.g. [[capitalism]] or [[socialism]]). The same word is sometimes used to identify both an ideology and one of its main ideas. For instance, socialism may refer to an economic system, or it may refer to an ideology which supports that economic system. The same term may also be used to refer to multiple ideologies and that is why political scientists try to find consensus definitions for these terms. While the terms have been conflated at times, [[communism]] has come in common parlance and in academics to refer to [[Soviet-type economic planning|Soviet-type regimes]] and [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]] ideologies whereas socialism has come to refer to a wider range of differing ideologies which are distinct from Marxism\u2013Leninism.<ref>Roberts, Andrew (2004). [https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/slavic-review/article/state-of-socialism-a-note-on-terminology/4C742B00BE0D00ED3F0BE855097DE5F7 ''The State of Socialism: A Note on Terminology'']. Cambridge University Press.  63 (2). 349\u2013366.</ref>\n\nPolitical ideology is a term fraught with problems, having been called \"the most elusive concept in the whole of social science\".<ref>D. McLellan, ''Ideology'', [[University of Minnesota Press]], 1986, p. 1.</ref> While ideologies tend to identify themselves by their position on the [[political spectrum]] (such as the [[Left-wing politics|left]], the [[Centrism|centre]] or the [[Right-wing politics|right]]), they can be distinguished from political strategies (e.g. [[populism]] as it is commonly defined) and from [[Single-issue politics|single issues]] around which a party may be built (e.g. [[civil libertarianism]] and [[Pro-Europeanism|support]] or [[Euroscepticism|opposition to European integration]]), although either of these may or may not be central to a particular ideology. There are several studies that show that political ideology is heritable within families.<ref>Bouchard, T. J.; McGue, M. (2003). \"Genetic and environmental influences on human psychological differences\". ''Journal of Neurobiology''. 54 (1). 44\u201345.</ref><ref>Eaves, L. J.; Eysenck, H. J.

The headers refer to names of the best-known ideologies in each group. The names of the headers do not necessarily imply some hierarchical order or that one ideology evolved out of the other. Instead, they are merely noting that the ideologies in question are practically, historically and ideologically related to each other. As such, one ideology can belong to several groups and there is sometimes considerable overlap between related ideologies. The meaning of a political label can also differ between countries and political parties often subscribe to a combination of ideologies.\n\n== Anarchism ==\n{{main|Anarchism}}\n{{see also|Anarchist

A political ideology largely concerns itself with how to allocate [[Power (sociology)|power]] and to what ends it should be used. Some [[Political party|political parties]] follow a certain ideology very closely while others may take broad inspiration from a group of related ideologies without specifically embracing any one of them. The popularity of an ideology is in part due to the influence of [[moral entrepreneur]]s, who sometimes act in their own interests. Political ideologies have two dimensions: (1) goals: how society should be organized; and (2) methods: the most appropriate way to achieve this goal.\n\nAn ideology is a collection of ideas. Typically, each ideology contains certain ideas on what it considers to be the best [[Forms of government|form of government]] (e.g. [[autocracy]] or [[democracy]]) and the best [[economic system]] (e.g. [[capitalism]] or [[socialism]]). The same word is sometimes used to identify both an ideology and one of its main ideas. For instance, socialism may refer to an economic system, or it may refer to an ideology which supports that economic system. The same term may also be used to refer to multiple ideologies and that is why political scientists try to find consensus definitions for these terms. While the terms have been conflated at times, [[communism]] has come in common parlance and in academics to refer to [[Soviet-type economic planning|Soviet-type regimes]] and [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]] ideologies whereas socialism has come to refer to a wider range of differing ideologies which are distinct from Marxism\u2013Leninism.<ref>Roberts, Andrew (2004). [https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/slavic-review/article/state-of-socialism-a-note-on-terminology/4C742B00BE0D00ED3F0BE855097DE5F7 ''The State of Socialism: A Note on Terminology'']. Cambridge University Press.  63 (2). 349\u2013366.</ref>\n\nPolitical ideology is a term fraught with problems, having been called \"the most elusive concept in the whole of social science\".<ref>D. McLellan, ''Ideology'', [[University of Minnesota Press]], 1986, p. 1.</ref> While ideologies tend to identify themselves by their position on the [[political spectrum]] (such as the [[Left-wing politics|left]], the [[Centrism|centre]] or the [[Right-wing politics|right]]), they can be distinguished from political strategies (e.g. [[populism]] as it is commonly defined) and from [[Single-issue politics|single issues]] around which a party may be built (e.g. [[civil libertarianism]] and [[Pro-Europeanism|support]] or [[Euroscepticism|opposition to European integration]]), although either of these may or may not be central to a particular ideology. There are several studies that show that political ideology is heritable within families.<ref>Bouchard, T. J.; McGue, M. (2003). \"Genetic and environmental influences on human psychological differences\". ''Journal of Neurobiology''. 54 (1). 44\u201345.</ref><ref>Eaves, L. J.; Eysenck, H. J.

The headers refer to names of the best-known ideologies in each group. The names of the headers do not necessarily imply some hierarchical order or that one ideology evolved out of the other. Instead, they are merely noting that the ideologies in question are practically, historically and ideologically related to each other. As such, one ideology can belong to several groups and there is sometimes considerable overlap between related ideologies. The meaning of a political label can also differ between countries and political parties often subscribe to a combination of ideologies.\n\n== Anarchism ==\n{{main|Anarchism}}\n{{see also|Anarchist
