Lenders in [[ancient Greece]] and during the [[Roman Empire]] added two important innovations: they accepted [[Deposit account|deposits]] and [[Bureau de change|changed money]].{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} Archaeology from this period in [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]] and [[history of India|India]] also shows evidence of money lending.\n\nThe present era of banking can be traced to medieval and early [[Renaissance]] [[Italy]], to the rich cities in the centre and north like [[Florence]], [[Lucca]], [[Siena]], [[Venice]] and [[Genoa]]. The [[Bardi family|Bardi]] and [[Peruzzi]] families dominated banking in 14th-century Florence, establishing branches in many other parts of [[Europe]].<ref>[[Noble Foster Hoggson|Hoggson, N.

Merchants started to store their gold with the [[goldsmith]]s of [[London]], who possessed private [[bank vault|vaults]], and charged a fee for that service. In exchange for each deposit of precious metal, the goldsmiths issued [[receipt]]s certifying the quantity and purity of the metal they held as a [[bailee]]; these receipts could not be assigned, only the original depositor could collect the stored goods.\n\nGradually the goldsmiths began to lend the money out on behalf of the [[deposit (finance)|depositor]], and [[promissory note]]s (which evolved into banknotes) were issued for money deposited as a loan to the goldsmith.<ref>Thus by the 19th century we find \u201c[i]n ordinary cases of deposits of money with banking corporations, or bankers, the transaction amounts to a mere loan or mutuum, and the bank is to restore, not the same money, but an equivalent sum, whenever it is demanded.\u201d Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Law of Bailments (1832, p. 66) and \u201cMoney, when paid into a bank, ceases altogether to be the money of the principal (see Parker v. Marchant, 1 Phillips 360); it is then the money of the banker, who is bound to return an equivalent by paying a similar sum to that deposited with him when he is asked for it.\u201d [[Charles Pepys, 1st Earl of Cottenham|Lord Chancellor Cottenham]], ''[[Foley v Hill]]'' (1848) 2 HLC 28.</ref> The goldsmith paid interest on these deposits. Since the promissory notes were payable on demand, and the advances (loans) to the goldsmith's customers were repayable over a longer time period, this was an early form of [[fractional reserve banking]]. The promissory notes developed into an assignable instrument which could circulate as a safe and convenient form of money backed by the goldsmith's promise to pay,<ref>Richards. The usual denomination was 50 or 100 pounds, so these notes were not an everyday currency for the common people</ref> allowing goldsmiths to advance loans with little risk of [[default (finance)|default]].<ref>Richards, p. 40</ref> Thus, the goldsmiths of London became the forerunners of banking by creating new money based on credit.\n\nThe [[Bank of England]] was the first to begin the permanent issue of [[banknote]]s, in 1695.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishnotes.co.uk/news_and_info/features/|title=A History of British Banknotes|work=britishnotes.co.uk}}</ref> The [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] established the first [[overdraft]] facility in 1728.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eccount.com/financial-news/a-short-history-of-overdrafts/#.UneWvFMqvp0 |title=A short history of overdrafts |publisher=eccount money |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105155745/http://www.eccount.com/financial-news/a-short-history-of-overdrafts/ |archivedate=2013-11-05 }}</ref> By the beginning of the 19th century a [[bankers' clearing house]] was established in London to allow multiple banks to clear transactions.

See the relevant country pages for more information.\n\nUnder [[English common law]], a banker is defined as a person who carries on the business of banking by conducting [[Current account (banking)|current accounts]] for his customers, paying [[cheques]] drawn on him/her and also collecting [[cheques]] for his/her customers.<ref>[[United Dominions Trust Ltd v Kirkwood]], 1966, English Court of Appeal, 2 QB 431</ref>\n[[File:Banco de Venezuela, Coro.JPG|thumb|[[Banco de Venezuela]] in [[Coro, Venezuela|Coro]].]]\n[[File:Bank.Pokhara.JPG|thumb|Branch of [[Nepal Bank Limited|Nepal Bank]] in Pokhara, Western Nepal.]]\n\nIn most common law jurisdictions there is a Bills of Exchange Act that codifies the law in relation to [[negotiable instruments]], including [[cheques]], and this Act contains a statutory definition of the term ''banker'': ''banker'' includes a body of persons, whether incorporated or not, who carry on the business of banking' (Section 2, Interpretation). Although this definition seems circular, it is actually functional, because it ensures that the legal basis for bank transactions such as cheques does not depend on how the bank is structured or regulated.\n\nThe business of banking is in many common law countries not defined by statute but by common law, the definition above. In other English common law jurisdictions there are statutory definitions of the ''business of banking'' or ''banking business''. When looking at these definitions it is important to keep in mind that they are defining the business of banking for the purposes of the legislation, and not necessarily in general. In particular, most of the definitions are from legislation that has the purpose of regulating and supervising banks rather than regulating the actual business of banking. However, in many cases the statutory definition closely mirrors the common law one. Examples of statutory definitions:\n* \"banking business\" means the business of receiving money on current or deposit account, paying and collecting cheques drawn by or paid in by customers, the making of advances to customers, and includes such other business as the Authority may prescribe for the purposes of this Act; (Banking Act ([[Singapore]]), Section 2, Interpretation).\n* \"banking business\" means the business of either or both of the following:\n# receiving from the general public money on current, deposit, savings or other similar account repayable on demand or within less than [3 months] ... or with a period of call or notice of less than that period;\n# paying or collecting cheques drawn by or paid in by customers.<ref>(Banking Ordinance, Section 2, Interpretation, Hong Kong) Note that in this case the definition is extended to include accepting any deposits repayable in less than 3 months, companies that accept deposits of greater than HK$100 000 for periods of greater than 3 months are regulated as [[List of banks in Hong Kong|deposit taking companies]] rather than as banks in Hong Kong.</ref>\n\nSince the advent of [[EFTPOS]] (Electronic Funds Transfer at Point Of Sale), direct credit, [[direct debit]] and [[online banking|internet banking]], the cheque has lost its primacy in most banking systems as a payment instrument. This has led legal theorists to suggest that the cheque based definition should be broadened to include financial institutions that conduct current accounts for customers and enable customers to pay and be paid by third parties, even if they do not pay and collect cheques .<ref>e.g. Tyree's Banking Law in New Zealand, A L Tyree, LexisNexis 2003, p. 70.</ref>\n\n===Standard business===\n[[File:WinonaSavingsBankVault.JPG|thumb|Large door to an old [[bank vault]].]]\nBanks act as payment agents by conducting [[Transactional account|checking or current accounts]] for customers, paying [[cheque]]s drawn by customers in the bank, and collecting cheques deposited to customers' current accounts. Banks also enable customer payments via other payment methods such as [[Automated Clearing House]] (ACH), [[Wire transfer]]s or [[telegraphic transfer]], [[EFTPOS]], and [[automated teller machine]]s (ATMs).\n\nBanks borrow money by accepting funds deposited on current accounts, by accepting [[term deposit]]s, and by issuing debt securities such as [[banknotes]] and [[Bond (finance)|bonds]]. Banks lend money by making advances to customers on current accounts, by making [[installment loan]]s, and by investing in marketable debt securities and other forms of money lending.\n\nBanks provide different payment services, and a bank account is considered indispensable by most businesses and individuals. Non-banks that provide payment services such as remittance companies are normally not considered as an adequate substitute for a bank account.\n\nBanks can create new money when they make a loan. New loans throughout the banking system generate new deposits elsewhere in the system. The money supply is usually increased by the act of lending, and reduced when loans are repaid faster than new ones are generated. In the [[United Kingdom]] between 1997 and 2007, there was an increase in the money supply, largely caused by much more bank lending, which served to push up property prices and increase private debt. The amount of money in the economy as measured by M4 in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] went from \u00a3750 billion to \u00a31700 billion between 1997 and 2007, much of the increase caused by bank lending.<ref>Bank of England statistics and the book \"Where does money come from?\", p. 47, by the New Economics Foundation.</ref> If all the banks increase their lending together, then they can expect new deposits to return to them and the amount of money in the economy will increase. Excessive or risky lending can cause borrowers to default, the banks then become more cautious, so there is less lending and therefore less money so that the economy can go from boom to bust as happened in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and many other Western economies after 2007.\n[[File:NatWest banking van at Berkeley, Glos, England 2Aug2018 arp.jpg|thumb|left|A NatWest mobile banking van in the town of [[Berkeley, Gloucestershire|Berkeley]], Gloucestershire, England. The van visits Berkeley for two hours each Thursday following the closure of the town's NatWest branch in 2015.]]\n\n===Range of activities===\nActivities undertaken by banks include [[retail banking|personal banking]], [[commercial bank|corporate banking]], [[investment banking]], [[private banking]], [[transaction banking]], [[insurance]], [[loan|consumer finance]], [[foreign exchange market|foreign exchange trading]], [[commodity market|commodity trading]], [[stock market|trading in equities]], [[futures exchange|futures and options trading]] and [[money market|money market trading]].\n\n===Channels===\n[[File:SunTrust Bank, Gaithersburg, Maryland, August 25, 2015.jpg|thumb|An American bank in Maryland.]]\nBanks offer many different channels to access their banking and other services:\n* [[Branch (banking)|Branch, in-person banking]] in a retail location\n* [[Automated teller machine|Automated teller machine banking]] adjacent to or remote from the bank\n* Bank by mail: Most banks accept cheque deposits via mail and use mail to communicate to their customers\n* [[Online banking]] over the Internet to perform multiple types of transactions\n* [[Mobile banking]] is using one's mobile phone to conduct banking transactions\n* [[Telephone banking]] allows customers to conduct transactions over the telephone with an [[automated attendant]], or when requested, with a [[switchboard operator|telephone operator]]\n* [[Video banking]] performs banking transactions or professional banking consultations via a remote video and audio connection. Video banking can be performed via purpose built banking transaction machines (similar to an Automated teller machine) or via a [[video conference]] enabled bank branch clarification\n* [[Customer relationship management|Relationship manager]], mostly for private banking or business banking, who visits customers at their homes or businesses\n* [[Direct Selling Association|Direct Selling Agent]], who works for the bank based on a contract, whose main job is to increase the customer base for the bank\n\n===Business models===\nA bank can generate revenue in a variety of different ways including interest, transaction fees and financial advice. Traditionally, the most significant method is via charging [[interest]] on the capital it lends out to customers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gobankingrates.com/banking/banks/how-banks-make-money/|title=How Do Banks Make Money?}}</ref> The bank profits from the difference between the level of interest it pays for deposits and other sources of funds, and the level of interest it charges in its lending activities.\n\nThis difference is referred to as the [[Net interest spread|spread]] between the cost of funds and the loan interest rate. Historically, profitability from lending activities has been cyclical and dependent on the needs and strengths of loan customers and the stage of the [[economic cycle]]. Fees and financial advice constitute a more stable revenue stream and banks have therefore placed more emphasis on these revenue lines to smooth their financial performance.\n\nIn the past 20 years, American banks have taken many measures to ensure that they remain profitable while responding to increasingly changing market conditions.\n* First, this includes the [[Gramm\u2013Leach\u2013Bliley Act]], which allows banks again to merge with investment and insurance houses. Merging banking, investment, and insurance functions allows traditional banks to respond to increasing consumer demands for \"one-stop shopping\" by enabling [[cross-selling]] of products (which, the banks hope, will also increase profitability).\n* Second, they have expanded the use of [[risk-based pricing]] from business lending to consumer lending, which means charging higher interest rates to those customers that are considered to be a higher credit risk and thus increased chance of [[default (finance)|default]] on loans. This helps to offset the losses from bad loans, lowers the price of loans to those who have better credit histories, and offers credit products to high risk customers who would otherwise be denied credit.\n* Third, they have sought to increase the methods of payment processing available to the general public and business clients. These products include [[debit card]]s, prepaid cards, [[smart card]]s, and [[credit card]]s. They make it easier for consumers to conveniently make transactions and [[consumption smoothing|smooth their consumption]] over time (in some countries with underdeveloped financial systems, it is still common to deal strictly in cash, including carrying suitcases filled with cash to purchase a home).\n\n:However, with the convenience of easy credit, there is also increased risk that consumers will mismanage their financial resources and accumulate excessive debt. Banks make money from card products through interest charges and fees charged to cardholders, and [[transaction fee]]s to retailers who accept the bank's credit and/or debit cards for payments.\nThis helps in making a profit and facilitates economic development as a whole.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/10385783/how-banks-make-money.html|title= How Banks Make Money|publisher= The Street|accessdate=2011-09-08}}</ref>\n\nRecently, as banks have been faced with pressure from fintechs, new and additional business models have been suggested such as freemium, monetization of data, white-labeling of banking and payment applications, or the cross-selling of complementary products.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Blockchain Babel: The Crypto-craze and the Challenge to Business|last=Pejic|first=Igor|date=2019-03-28|publisher=Kogan Page|isbn=9780749484163|edition= 1st|language=English}}</ref>\n\n===Products===\n[[File:Halifax bank, Commercial Street, Leeds (27th May 2010).jpg|thumb|right|A former [[building society]], now a modern retail bank in [[Leeds]], [[West Yorkshire]].]]\n[[File:NatWest Castle Street.jpg|thumb|right| An interior of a branch of [[National Westminster Bank]] on Castle Street, [[Liverpool]]]]\n\n====Retail====\n* [[Savings account]]\n* [[Recurring deposit|Recurring deposit account]]\n* [[Fixed deposit|Fixed deposit account]]\n* [[Money market account]]\n* [[Certificate of deposit]] (CD)\n* [[Individual retirement account]] (IRA)\n* [[Credit card]]\n* [[Debit card]]\n* [[Mortgage]]\n* [[Mutual fund]]\n* [[Personal loan]]\n* [[Time deposits]]\n* [[ATM card]]\n* [[Transactional account#Current accounts|Current accounts]]\n* [[Cheque|Cheque books]]\n* [[Automated Teller Machine]] (ATM)\n* [[National Electronic Fund Transfer]] (NEFT)\n* [[Real Time Gross Settlement]] (RTGS)\n\n====Business (or commercial/investment) banking====\n* [[Loan|Business loan]]\n* [[Stock exchange#Raising capital for businesses|Capital raising]] ([[Equity (finance)|equity]] / [[debt]] / [[Hybrid security|hybrids]])\n* [[Revolving credit]]\n* [[Risk management]] ([[Foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]] (FX)), [[interest rate]]s, [[Commodity|commodities]], [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]]\n* [[Term loan]]\n* Cash management services (lock box, remote deposit capture, merchant processing)\n* [[Credit (finance)|Credit services]]\n\n==Capital and risk==\nBanks face a number of [[financial risk|risks]] in order to conduct their business, and how well these risks are managed and understood is a key driver behind profitability, and how much [[Capital requirement|capital]] a bank is required to hold.

These claims on banks can act as money because they are negotiable or repayable on demand, and hence valued at par. They are effectively transferable by mere delivery, in the case of banknotes, or by drawing a cheque that the payee may bank or cash.\n# Netting and settlement of payments \u2013 banks act as both collection and paying agents for customers, participating in interbank clearing and settlement systems to collect, present, be presented with, and pay payment instruments. This enables banks to economize on reserves held for settlement of payments, since inward and outward payments offset each other. It also enables the offsetting of payment flows between geographical areas, reducing the cost of settlement between them.\n# Credit intermediation \u2013 banks borrow and lend back-to-back on their own account as middle men.\n# Credit quality improvement \u2013 banks lend money to ordinary commercial and personal borrowers (ordinary credit quality), but are high quality borrowers. The improvement comes from diversification of the bank's assets and capital which provides a buffer to absorb losses without defaulting on its obligations. However, banknotes and deposits are generally unsecured; if the bank gets into difficulty and pledges assets as security, to raise the funding it needs to continue to operate, this puts the note holders and depositors in an economically subordinated position.\n# [[Asset liability mismatch]]/[[Maturity transformation]] \u2013 banks borrow more on demand debt and short term debt, but provide more long term loans. In other words, they borrow short and lend long. With a stronger credit quality than most other borrowers, banks can do this by aggregating issues (e.g. accepting deposits and issuing banknotes) and redemptions (e.g. withdrawals and redemption of banknotes), maintaining reserves of cash, investing in marketable securities that can be readily converted to cash if needed, and raising replacement funding as needed from various sources (e.g. wholesale cash markets and securities markets).\n# [[Money creation]]/destruction \u2013 whenever a bank gives out a loan in a [[fractional-reserve banking]] system, a new sum of money is created and conversely, whenever the principal on that loan is repaid money is destroyed.\n\n==Bank crisis==\n[[File:Bosakov dom.jpg|thumb|upright=0.55|OTP Bank in [[Pre\u0161ov]] (Slovakia)]]\nBanks are susceptible to many forms of risk which have triggered occasional systemic crises.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/chiararustici/2018/07/24/personal-data-and-the-next-subprime-crisis/#4748d43370aa|title=Personal Data And The Next Subprime Crisis}}</ref> These include [[liquidity risk]] (where many depositors may request withdrawals in excess of available funds), [[credit risk]] (the chance that those who owe money to the bank will not repay it), and [[interest rate risk]] (the possibility that the bank will become unprofitable, if rising interest rates force it to pay relatively more on its deposits than it receives on its loans).\n\nBanking crises have developed many times throughout history when one or more risks have emerged for a banking sector as a whole. Prominent examples include the [[bank run]] that occurred during the [[Great Depression]], the U.S. [[Savings and Loan crisis]] in the 1980s and early 1990s, the [[Japan]]ese banking crisis during the 1990s, and the [[sub-prime mortgage crisis]] in the 2000s.\n\n===Size of global banking industry===\nAssets of the largest 1,000 banks in the world grew by 6.8% in the 2008/2009 financial year to a record US$96.4&nbsp;trillion while profits declined by 85% to US$115&nbsp;billion. Growth in assets in adverse market conditions was largely a result of recapitalization. EU banks held the largest share of the total, 56% in 2008/2009, down from 61% in the previous year. Asian banks' share increased from 12% to 14% during the year, while the share of US banks increased from 11% to 13%.

Central banks also typically have a monopoly on the business of issuing [[banknote]]s. However, in some countries this is not the case. In the UK, for example, the [[Financial Services Authority]] licenses banks, and some commercial banks (such as the [[Bank of Scotland]]) issue their own banknotes in addition to those issued by the [[Bank of England]], the UK government's central bank.\n\n[[File:Basel - Bottabau am Aeschenplatz1.jpg|thumb|Global headquarters of the [[Bank for International Settlements]] in [[Basel]]]]\n\nBanking law is based on a contractual analysis of the relationship between the ''bank'' (defined above) and the ''customer''&nbsp;\u2013 defined as any entity for which the bank agrees to conduct an account.\n\nThe law implies rights and obligations into this relationship as follows:\n* The bank account balance is the financial position between the bank and the customer: when the account is in credit, the bank owes the balance to the customer; when the account is overdrawn, the customer owes the balance to the bank.\n* The bank agrees to pay the customer's checks up to the amount standing to the credit of the customer's account, plus any agreed overdraft limit.\n* The bank may not pay from the customer's account without a mandate from the customer, e.g. a cheque drawn by the customer.\n* The bank agrees to promptly collect the cheques deposited to the customer's account as the customer's agent, and to credit the proceeds to the customer's account.\n* The bank has a right to combine the customer's accounts, since each account is just an aspect of the same credit relationship.\n* The bank has a [[lien]] on cheques deposited to the customer's account, to the extent that the customer is indebted to the bank.\n* The bank must not disclose details of transactions through the customer's account&nbsp;\u2013 unless the customer consents, there is a public duty to disclose, the bank's interests require it, or the law demands it.\n* The bank must not close a customer's account without reasonable notice, since cheques are outstanding in the ordinary course of business for several days.\n\nThese implied contractual terms may be modified by express agreement between the customer and the bank. The statutes and regulations in force within a particular jurisdiction may also modify the above terms and/or create new rights, obligations or limitations relevant to the bank-customer relationship.\n\nSome types of financial institution, such as [[Building Society|building societies]] and [[credit unions]], may be partly or wholly exempt from bank license requirements, and therefore regulated under separate rules.\n\nThe requirements for the issue of a bank license vary between jurisdictions but typically include:\n* Minimum capital\n* Minimum capital ratio\n* 'Fit and Proper' requirements for the bank's controllers, owners, directors, or senior officers\n* Approval of the bank's business plan as being sufficiently prudent and plausible.\n\n==Types of banking==\nBanks' activities can be divided into:\n* [[retail banking]], dealing directly with individuals and small businesses;\n* [[business banking]], providing services to mid-market business;\n* [[corporate banking]], directed at large business entities;\n* [[private banking]], providing wealth management services to [[high-net-worth individual]]s and families;\n* [[investment banking]], relating to activities on the [[financial markets]].\nMost banks are profit-making, private enterprises.

After the [[Great Depression]], the U.S. Congress required that banks only engage in banking activities, whereas investment banks were limited to [[capital market]] activities. Since the two no longer have to be under separate ownership, some use the term \"commercial bank\" to refer to a bank or a division of a bank that mostly deals with deposits and loans from corporations or large businesses.\n* [[Community banks]]: locally operated financial institutions that empower employees to make local decisions to serve their customers and the partners.\n* [[Community development bank]]s: regulated banks that provide financial services and credit to under-served markets or populations.\n* [[Land development bank]]s: The special banks providing long-term loans are called [[land development bank]]s (LDB). The history of LDB is quite old. The first LDB was started at Jhang in [[Punjab]] in 1920. The main objective of the LDBs are to promote the development of land, agriculture and increase the agricultural production. The LDBs provide long-term finance to members  directly through their branches.<ref name=\"agritech\">{{cite web | url=http://agritech.tnau.ac.in/banking/crbank_land_dvpt_bank.html | title=Land Development Bank | publisher=TNAU Agritech Portal | accessdate=8 January 2014 | author=TNAU}}</ref>\n* [[Credit union]]s or [[Cooperative banking|co-operative banks]]: not-for-profit [[cooperatives]] owned by the depositors and often offering rates more favourable than for-profit banks.

Many offshore banks are essentially private banks.\n* [[Savings bank]]: in Europe, savings banks took their roots in the 19th or sometimes even in the 18th century. Their original objective was to provide easily accessible savings products to all strata of the population. In some countries, savings banks were created on public initiative; in others, socially committed individuals created foundations to put in place the necessary infrastructure. Nowadays, European savings banks have kept their focus on retail banking: payments, savings products, credits and insurances for individuals or small and medium-sized enterprises. Apart from this retail focus, they also differ from commercial banks by their broadly decentralized distribution network, providing local and regional outreach&nbsp;\u2013 and by their socially responsible approach to business and society.\n* [[Building societies]] and [[Landesbank]]s: institutions that conduct retail banking.\n* [[Ethical bank]]s: banks that prioritize the transparency of all operations and make only what they consider to be socially responsible investments.\n* A [[Direct bank|direct or internet-only bank]] is a banking operation without any physical bank branches. Transactions are usually accomplished using [[Automated teller machine|ATMs]] and [[Electronic funds transfer|electronic transfers]] and [[direct deposit]]s through an online interface.\n\n===Types of investment banks===\n* [[Investment bank]]s \"[[underwrite]]\" (guarantee the sale of) stock and bond issues, trade for their own accounts, make markets, provide [[investment management]], and advise corporations on [[capital market]] activities such as mergers and acquisitions.\n* [[Merchant bank]]s were traditionally banks which engaged in [[trade finance]]. The modern definition, however, refers to banks which provide capital to firms in the form of shares rather than loans. Unlike [[venture cap]]s, they tend not to invest in new companies.\n\n===Combination banks===\n[[File:BDO Bank in SM Aura, BGC.jpg|thumb|A [[Branch (banking)|branch]] of [[Banco de Oro]] in [[Metro Manila]], [[Philippines]]]]\n[[File:Avenida Sao Joao, Sao Paulo 2006.jpg|thumb|A [[Banco do Brasil]] office in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], [[Brazil]], the bank is the largest financial institution in Brazil and [[Latin America]].]]\n\n* [[Universal bank]]s, more commonly known as [[financial services]] companies, engage in several of these activities. These big banks are very diversified groups that, among other services, also distribute insurance&nbsp;\u2013  hence the term [[bancassurance]], a [[portmanteau|portmanteau word]] combining \"banque or bank\" and \"assurance\", signifying that both banking and insurance are provided by the same corporate entity.\n\n===Other types of banks===\n* [[Central bank]]s are normally government-owned and charged with quasi-regulatory responsibilities, such as supervising commercial banks, or controlling the cash [[interest rate]]. They generally provide liquidity to the banking system and act as the [[lender of last resort]] in event of a crisis.\n* [[Islamic bank]]s adhere to the concepts of [[Sharia|Islamic law]]. This form of banking revolves around several well-established principles based on Islamic canons. All banking activities must avoid interest, a concept that is forbidden in Islam. Instead, the bank earns profit ([[Markup (business)|markup]]) and fees on the financing facilities that it extends to customers.\n\n==Challenges within the banking industry==\n{{Globalize|section|date=September 2009}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2008}}\n\n===United States===\n{{Main|Banking in the United States}}\n[[File:People's Trust Company Building 183 Montague Street Brooklyn.jpg|upright=0.8|thumb|right|[[Citibank]], The People's Trust Company Building, [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]].]]\n\nThe United States banking industry is one of the most heavily regulated and guarded in the world,<ref>Scott Besley and Eugene F. Brigham, ''Principles of Finance'', 4th ed. (Mason, OH: South-Western Cengage Learning, 2009), 125.  This popular university textbook explains: \"Generally speaking, U.S. financial institutions have been much more heavily regulated and faced greater limitations ... than have their foreign counterparts.\"</ref> with multiple specialized and focused regulators. All banks with FDIC-insured deposits have the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) as a regulator. However, for soundness examinations (i.e., whether a bank is operating in a sound manner), the [[Federal Reserve]] is the primary federal regulator for Fed-member state banks; the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]] (OCC) is the primary federal regulator for national banks. State non-member banks are examined by the state agencies as well as the FDIC. National banks have one primary regulator&nbsp;\u2013 the OCC.\n\nEach regulatory agency has their own set of rules and regulations to which banks and thrifts must adhere.\nThe [[Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council]] (FFIEC) was established in 1979 as a formal inter-agency body empowered to prescribe uniform principles, standards, and report forms for the federal examination of financial institutions. Although the FFIEC has resulted in a greater degree of regulatory consistency between the agencies, the rules and regulations are constantly changing.\n\nIn addition to changing regulations, changes in the industry have led to consolidations within the Federal Reserve, FDIC, OTS, and OCC. Offices have been closed, supervisory regions have been merged, staff levels have been reduced and budgets have been cut. The remaining regulators face an increased burden with increased workload and more banks per regulator. While banks struggle to keep up with the changes in the regulatory environment, regulators struggle to manage their workload and effectively regulate their banks. The impact of these changes is that banks are receiving less hands-on assessment by the regulators, less time spent with each institution, and the potential for more problems slipping through the cracks, potentially resulting in an overall increase in bank failures across the United States.\n\nThe changing economic environment has a significant impact on banks and thrifts as they struggle to effectively manage their interest rate spread in the face of low rates on loans, rate competition for deposits and the general market changes, industry trends and economic fluctuations. It has been a challenge for banks to effectively set their growth strategies with the recent economic market. A rising interest rate environment may seem to help financial institutions, but the effect of the changes on consumers and businesses is not predictable and the challenge remains for banks to grow and effectively manage the spread to generate a return to their shareholders.\n\nThe management of the banks\u2019 asset portfolios also remains a challenge in today's economic environment. Loans are a bank's primary asset category and when loan quality becomes suspect, the foundation of a bank is shaken to the core. While always an issue for banks, declining [[asset quality]] has become a big problem for financial institutions.\n[[File:Mirror building (4004925857).jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|right|[[Safra National Bank]], New York]]\nThere are several reasons for this, one of which is the lax attitude some banks have adopted because of the years of \u201cgood times.\u201d The potential for this is exacerbated by the reduction in the regulatory oversight of banks and in some cases depth of management. Problems are more likely to go undetected, resulting in a significant impact on the bank when they are discovered. In addition, banks, like any business, struggle to cut costs and have consequently eliminated certain expenses, such as adequate employee training programs.\n\nBanks also face a host of other challenges such as ageing ownership groups. Across the country, many banks\u2019 management teams and board of directors are ageing. Banks also face ongoing pressure by shareholders, both public and private, to achieve earnings and growth projections. Regulators place added pressure on banks to manage the various categories of risk. Banking is also an extremely competitive industry. Competing in the financial services industry has become tougher with the entrance of such players as insurance agencies, credit unions, cheque cashing services, credit card companies, etc.\n\nAs a reaction, banks have developed their activities in [[financial instruments]], through [[financial market]] operations such as [[brokerage firm|brokerage]] and have become big players in such activities.\n\nAnother major challenge is the ageing infrastructure, also called legacy IT. Backend systems were built decades ago and are incompatible to new applications.

The phenomenon of [[disintermediation]] had to dollars moving from savings accounts and into direct market instruments such as [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Department of Treasury]] obligations, agency securities, and corporate debt. One of the greatest factors in recent years in the movement of deposits was the tremendous growth of money market funds whose higher interest rates attracted consumer deposits.<ref name=\"multiple3\">{{cite book |author1=Mishler, Lon |author2=Cole, Robert E. |title=Consumer and business credit management |publisher=Irwin |location=Homewood |year=1995 |pages=128\u201329 |isbn=978-0-256-13948-8 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref>\n\nTo compete for deposits, US savings institutions offer many different types of plans:<ref name=\"multiple3\"/>\n* [[Passbook]] or ordinary [[deposit account]]s &nbsp;\u2013  permit any amount to be added to or withdrawn from the account at any time.\n* NOW and Super NOW accounts &nbsp;\u2013  function like checking accounts but earn interest.

Under [[Generally accepted accounting principles|GAAP]] there are two kinds of accounts: debit and credit. Credit accounts are Revenue, Equity and Liabilities. Debit Accounts are Assets and Expenses. The bank credits a ''credit account'' to increase its balance, and debits a ''credit account'' to decrease its balance.<ref>{{cite book | title= Monetary and Financial Statistics: Compilation Guide | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=a03zkw-5fcEC | author= Statistics Department | year= 2001 | page= 24 | chapter= Source Data for Monetary and Financial Statistics | chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=a03zkw-5fcEC&pg=PT36 | publisher= [[International Monetary Fund]] | location= [[Washington D.C.]] | isbn= 978-1-58906-584-0 | accessdate= 2009-03-14}}</ref>\n\nThe customer debits his or her savings/bank (asset) account in his ledger when making a deposit (and the account is normally in debit), while the customer credits a credit card (liability) account in his ledger every time he spends money (and the account is normally in credit). When the customer reads his bank statement, the statement will show a credit to the account for deposits, and debits for withdrawals of funds. The customer with a positive balance will see this balance reflected as a credit balance on the bank statement. If the customer is overdrawn, he will have a negative balance, reflected as a debit balance on the bank statement.\n\n===Brokered deposits===\nOne source of deposits for banks is brokers who deposit large sums of money on behalf of investors through trust corporations. This money will generally go to the banks which offer the most favourable terms, often better than those offered local depositors. It is possible for a bank to engage in business with no local deposits at all, all funds being brokered deposits. Accepting a significant quantity of such deposits, or \"[[hot money]]\" as it is sometimes called, puts a bank in a difficult and sometimes risky position, as the funds must be lent or invested in a way that yields a return sufficient to pay the high interest being paid on the brokered deposits. This may result in risky decisions and even in eventual failure of the bank. Banks which failed during 2008 and 2009 in the United States during the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132008|global financial crisis]] had, on average, four times more brokered deposits as a percent of their deposits than the average bank. Such deposits, combined with risky real estate investments, factored into the [[savings and loan crisis]] of the 1980s. Regulation of brokered deposits is opposed by banks on the grounds that the practice can be a source of external funding to growing communities with insufficient local deposits.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/04/business/04brokered.html |title=For Banks, Wads of Cash and Loads of Trouble |first=Eric |last=Lipton |author-link=Eric Lipton |first2=Andrew |last2=Martin |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=3 July 2009 |access-date=13 July 2018 |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |location=Macon, Ga}}</ref> There are different types of accounts: saving, recurring and current accounts.\n\n===Custodial accounts===\nCustodial accounts are accounts in which assets are held for a third party. For example, businesses that accept custody of funds for clients prior to their conversion, return or transfer may have a custodial account at a bank for this purposes.\n\n==Globalization in the banking industry==\nIn modern time there has been huge reductions to the barriers of global competition in the banking industry. Increases in telecommunications and other financial technologies, such as Bloomberg, have allowed banks to extend their reach all over the world, since they no longer have to be near customers to manage both their finances and their risk. The growth in cross-border activities has also increased the demand for banks that can provide various services across borders to different nationalities.\nHowever, despite these reductions in barriers and growth in cross-border activities, the banking industry is nowhere near as globalized as some other industries. In the US, for instance, very few banks even worry about the Riegle\u2013Neal Act, which promotes more efficient interstate banking. In the vast majority of nations around the globe the market share for foreign owned banks is currently less than a tenth of all market shares for banks in a particular nation.\nOne reason the banking industry has not been fully globalized is that it is more convenient to have local banks provide loans to small business and individuals. On the other hand, for large corporations, it is not as important in what nation the bank is in, since the corporation's financial information is available around the globe.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://scholar.google.nl/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=WXWj19cAAAAJ&citation_for_view=WXWj19cAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC |title=To what extent will the banking industry be globalized?

Due to their importance in the financial stability of a country, banks are [[Banking regulation|highly regulated]] in most countries. Most nations have institutionalized a system known as [[fractional reserve banking]] under which banks hold liquid assets equal to only a portion of their current liabilities. In addition to other regulations intended to ensure liquidity, banks are generally subject to [[minimum capital requirement]]s based on an international set of capital standards, known as the [[Basel Accords]].\n\nBanking in its modern sense evolved in the fourteenth century in the prosperous cities of [[Renaissance Italy]] but in many ways was a continuation of ideas and concepts of [[Credit (finance)|credit]] and [[lending]] that had their roots in the [[ancient world]]. In the [[history of banking]], a number of [[List of banking families|banking dynasties]] \u2013 notably, the [[House of Medici|Medicis]], the [[Fugger]]s, the [[Welser]]s, the [[Berenberg family|Berenbergs]], and the [[Rothschild family|Rothschilds]] \u2013 have played a central role over many centuries.

Lenders in [[ancient Greece]] and during the [[Roman Empire]] added two important innovations: they accepted [[Deposit account|deposits]] and [[Bureau de change|changed money]].{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} Archaeology from this period in [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient China]] and [[history of India|India]] also shows evidence of money lending.\n\nThe present era of banking can be traced to medieval and early [[Renaissance]] [[Italy]], to the rich cities in the centre and north like [[Florence]], [[Lucca]], [[Siena]], [[Venice]] and [[Genoa]]. The [[Bardi family|Bardi]] and [[Peruzzi]] families dominated banking in 14th-century Florence, establishing branches in many other parts of [[Europe]].<ref>[[Noble Foster Hoggson|Hoggson, N.

Merchants started to store their gold with the [[goldsmith]]s of [[London]], who possessed private [[bank vault|vaults]], and charged a fee for that service. In exchange for each deposit of precious metal, the goldsmiths issued [[receipt]]s certifying the quantity and purity of the metal they held as a [[bailee]]; these receipts could not be assigned, only the original depositor could collect the stored goods.\n\nGradually the goldsmiths began to lend the money out on behalf of the [[deposit (finance)|depositor]], and [[promissory note]]s (which evolved into banknotes) were issued for money deposited as a loan to the goldsmith.<ref>Thus by the 19th century we find \u201c[i]n ordinary cases of deposits of money with banking corporations, or bankers, the transaction amounts to a mere loan or mutuum, and the bank is to restore, not the same money, but an equivalent sum, whenever it is demanded.\u201d Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Law of Bailments (1832, p. 66) and \u201cMoney, when paid into a bank, ceases altogether to be the money of the principal (see Parker v. Marchant, 1 Phillips 360); it is then the money of the banker, who is bound to return an equivalent by paying a similar sum to that deposited with him when he is asked for it.\u201d [[Charles Pepys, 1st Earl of Cottenham|Lord Chancellor Cottenham]], ''[[Foley v Hill]]'' (1848) 2 HLC 28.</ref> The goldsmith paid interest on these deposits. Since the promissory notes were payable on demand, and the advances (loans) to the goldsmith's customers were repayable over a longer time period, this was an early form of [[fractional reserve banking]]. The promissory notes developed into an assignable instrument which could circulate as a safe and convenient form of money backed by the goldsmith's promise to pay,<ref>Richards. The usual denomination was 50 or 100 pounds, so these notes were not an everyday currency for the common people</ref> allowing goldsmiths to advance loans with little risk of [[default (finance)|default]].<ref>Richards, p. 40</ref> Thus, the goldsmiths of London became the forerunners of banking by creating new money based on credit.\n\nThe [[Bank of England]] was the first to begin the permanent issue of [[banknote]]s, in 1695.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishnotes.co.uk/news_and_info/features/|title=A History of British Banknotes|work=britishnotes.co.uk}}</ref> The [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] established the first [[overdraft]] facility in 1728.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eccount.com/financial-news/a-short-history-of-overdrafts/#.UneWvFMqvp0 |title=A short history of overdrafts |publisher=eccount money |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105155745/http://www.eccount.com/financial-news/a-short-history-of-overdrafts/ |archivedate=2013-11-05 }}</ref> By the beginning of the 19th century a [[bankers' clearing house]] was established in London to allow multiple banks to clear transactions.

See the relevant country pages for more information.\n\nUnder [[English common law]], a banker is defined as a person who carries on the business of banking by conducting [[Current account (banking)|current accounts]] for his customers, paying [[cheques]] drawn on him/her and also collecting [[cheques]] for his/her customers.<ref>[[United Dominions Trust Ltd v Kirkwood]], 1966, English Court of Appeal, 2 QB 431</ref>\n[[File:Banco de Venezuela, Coro.JPG|thumb|[[Banco de Venezuela]] in [[Coro, Venezuela|Coro]].]]\n[[File:Bank.Pokhara.JPG|thumb|Branch of [[Nepal Bank Limited|Nepal Bank]] in Pokhara, Western Nepal.]]\n\nIn most common law jurisdictions there is a Bills of Exchange Act that codifies the law in relation to [[negotiable instruments]], including [[cheques]], and this Act contains a statutory definition of the term ''banker'': ''banker'' includes a body of persons, whether incorporated or not, who carry on the business of banking' (Section 2, Interpretation). Although this definition seems circular, it is actually functional, because it ensures that the legal basis for bank transactions such as cheques does not depend on how the bank is structured or regulated.\n\nThe business of banking is in many common law countries not defined by statute but by common law, the definition above. In other English common law jurisdictions there are statutory definitions of the ''business of banking'' or ''banking business''. When looking at these definitions it is important to keep in mind that they are defining the business of banking for the purposes of the legislation, and not necessarily in general. In particular, most of the definitions are from legislation that has the purpose of regulating and supervising banks rather than regulating the actual business of banking. However, in many cases the statutory definition closely mirrors the common law one. Examples of statutory definitions:\n* \"banking business\" means the business of receiving money on current or deposit account, paying and collecting cheques drawn by or paid in by customers, the making of advances to customers, and includes such other business as the Authority may prescribe for the purposes of this Act; (Banking Act ([[Singapore]]), Section 2, Interpretation).\n* \"banking business\" means the business of either or both of the following:\n# receiving from the general public money on current, deposit, savings or other similar account repayable on demand or within less than [3 months] ... or with a period of call or notice of less than that period;\n# paying or collecting cheques drawn by or paid in by customers.<ref>(Banking Ordinance, Section 2, Interpretation, Hong Kong) Note that in this case the definition is extended to include accepting any deposits repayable in less than 3 months, companies that accept deposits of greater than HK$100 000 for periods of greater than 3 months are regulated as [[List of banks in Hong Kong|deposit taking companies]] rather than as banks in Hong Kong.</ref>\n\nSince the advent of [[EFTPOS]] (Electronic Funds Transfer at Point Of Sale), direct credit, [[direct debit]] and [[online banking|internet banking]], the cheque has lost its primacy in most banking systems as a payment instrument. This has led legal theorists to suggest that the cheque based definition should be broadened to include financial institutions that conduct current accounts for customers and enable customers to pay and be paid by third parties, even if they do not pay and collect cheques .<ref>e.g. Tyree's Banking Law in New Zealand, A L Tyree, LexisNexis 2003, p. 70.</ref>\n\n===Standard business===\n[[File:WinonaSavingsBankVault.JPG|thumb|Large door to an old [[bank vault]].]]\nBanks act as payment agents by conducting [[Transactional account|checking or current accounts]] for customers, paying [[cheque]]s drawn by customers in the bank, and collecting cheques deposited to customers' current accounts. Banks also enable customer payments via other payment methods such as [[Automated Clearing House]] (ACH), [[Wire transfer]]s or [[telegraphic transfer]], [[EFTPOS]], and [[automated teller machine]]s (ATMs).\n\nBanks borrow money by accepting funds deposited on current accounts, by accepting [[term deposit]]s, and by issuing debt securities such as [[banknotes]] and [[Bond (finance)|bonds]]. Banks lend money by making advances to customers on current accounts, by making [[installment loan]]s, and by investing in marketable debt securities and other forms of money lending.\n\nBanks provide different payment services, and a bank account is considered indispensable by most businesses and individuals. Non-banks that provide payment services such as remittance companies are normally not considered as an adequate substitute for a bank account.\n\nBanks can create new money when they make a loan. New loans throughout the banking system generate new deposits elsewhere in the system. The money supply is usually increased by the act of lending, and reduced when loans are repaid faster than new ones are generated. In the [[United Kingdom]] between 1997 and 2007, there was an increase in the money supply, largely caused by much more bank lending, which served to push up property prices and increase private debt. The amount of money in the economy as measured by M4 in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] went from \u00a3750 billion to \u00a31700 billion between 1997 and 2007, much of the increase caused by bank lending.<ref>Bank of England statistics and the book \"Where does money come from?\", p. 47, by the New Economics Foundation.</ref> If all the banks increase their lending together, then they can expect new deposits to return to them and the amount of money in the economy will increase. Excessive or risky lending can cause borrowers to default, the banks then become more cautious, so there is less lending and therefore less money so that the economy can go from boom to bust as happened in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and many other Western economies after 2007.\n[[File:NatWest banking van at Berkeley, Glos, England 2Aug2018 arp.jpg|thumb|left|A NatWest mobile banking van in the town of [[Berkeley, Gloucestershire|Berkeley]], Gloucestershire, England.

Video banking can be performed via purpose built banking transaction machines (similar to an Automated teller machine) or via a [[video conference]] enabled bank branch clarification\n* [[Customer relationship management|Relationship manager]], mostly for private banking or business banking, who visits customers at their homes or businesses\n* [[Direct Selling Association|Direct Selling Agent]], who works for the bank based on a contract, whose main job is to increase the customer base for the bank\n\n===Business models===\nA bank can generate revenue in a variety of different ways including interest, transaction fees and financial advice. Traditionally, the most significant method is via charging [[interest]] on the capital it lends out to customers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gobankingrates.com/banking/banks/how-banks-make-money/|title=How Do Banks Make Money?}}</ref> The bank profits from the difference between the level of interest it pays for deposits and other sources of funds, and the level of interest it charges in its lending activities.\n\nThis difference is referred to as the [[Net interest spread|spread]] between the cost of funds and the loan interest rate. Historically, profitability from lending activities has been cyclical and dependent on the needs and strengths of loan customers and the stage of the [[economic cycle]]. Fees and financial advice constitute a more stable revenue stream and banks have therefore placed more emphasis on these revenue lines to smooth their financial performance.\n\nIn the past 20 years, American banks have taken many measures to ensure that they remain profitable while responding to increasingly changing market conditions.\n* First, this includes the [[Gramm\u2013Leach\u2013Bliley Act]], which allows banks again to merge with investment and insurance houses. Merging banking, investment, and insurance functions allows traditional banks to respond to increasing consumer demands for \"one-stop shopping\" by enabling [[cross-selling]] of products (which, the banks hope, will also increase profitability).\n* Second, they have expanded the use of [[risk-based pricing]] from business lending to consumer lending, which means charging higher interest rates to those customers that are considered to be a higher credit risk and thus increased chance of [[default (finance)|default]] on loans. This helps to offset the losses from bad loans, lowers the price of loans to those who have better credit histories, and offers credit products to high risk customers who would otherwise be denied credit.\n* Third, they have sought to increase the methods of payment processing available to the general public and business clients. These products include [[debit card]]s, prepaid cards, [[smart card]]s, and [[credit card]]s. They make it easier for consumers to conveniently make transactions and [[consumption smoothing|smooth their consumption]] over time (in some countries with underdeveloped financial systems, it is still common to deal strictly in cash, including carrying suitcases filled with cash to purchase a home).\n\n:However, with the convenience of easy credit, there is also increased risk that consumers will mismanage their financial resources and accumulate excessive debt. Banks make money from card products through interest charges and fees charged to cardholders, and [[transaction fee]]s to retailers who accept the bank's credit and/or debit cards for payments.\nThis helps in making a profit and facilitates economic development as a whole.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/10385783/how-banks-make-money.html|title= How Banks Make Money|publisher= The Street|accessdate=2011-09-08}}</ref>\n\nRecently, as banks have been faced with pressure from fintechs, new and additional business models have been suggested such as freemium, monetization of data, white-labeling of banking and payment applications, or the cross-selling of complementary products.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Blockchain Babel: The Crypto-craze and the Challenge to Business|last=Pejic|first=Igor|date=2019-03-28|publisher=Kogan Page|isbn=9780749484163|edition= 1st|language=English}}</ref>\n\n===Products===\n[[File:Halifax bank, Commercial Street, Leeds (27th May 2010).jpg|thumb|right|A former [[building society]], now a modern retail bank in [[Leeds]], [[West Yorkshire]].]]\n[[File:NatWest Castle Street.jpg|thumb|right| An interior of a branch of [[National Westminster Bank]] on Castle Street, [[Liverpool]]]]\n\n====Retail====\n* [[Savings account]]\n* [[Recurring deposit|Recurring deposit account]]\n* [[Fixed deposit|Fixed deposit account]]\n* [[Money market account]]\n* [[Certificate of deposit]] (CD)\n* [[Individual retirement account]] (IRA)\n* [[Credit card]]\n* [[Debit card]]\n* [[Mortgage]]\n* [[Mutual fund]]\n* [[Personal loan]]\n* [[Time deposits]]\n* [[ATM card]]\n* [[Transactional account#Current accounts|Current accounts]]\n* [[Cheque|Cheque books]]\n* [[Automated Teller Machine]] (ATM)\n* [[National Electronic Fund Transfer]] (NEFT)\n* [[Real Time Gross Settlement]] (RTGS)\n\n====Business (or commercial/investment) banking====\n* [[Loan|Business loan]]\n* [[Stock exchange#Raising capital for businesses|Capital raising]] ([[Equity (finance)|equity]] / [[debt]] / [[Hybrid security|hybrids]])\n* [[Revolving credit]]\n* [[Risk management]] ([[Foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]] (FX)), [[interest rate]]s, [[Commodity|commodities]], [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]]\n* [[Term loan]]\n* Cash management services (lock box, remote deposit capture, merchant processing)\n* [[Credit (finance)|Credit services]]\n\n==Capital and risk==\nBanks face a number of [[financial risk|risks]] in order to conduct their business, and how well these risks are managed and understood is a key driver behind profitability, and how much [[Capital requirement|capital]] a bank is required to hold.

These claims on banks can act as money because they are negotiable or repayable on demand, and hence valued at par. They are effectively transferable by mere delivery, in the case of banknotes, or by drawing a cheque that the payee may bank or cash.\n# Netting and settlement of payments \u2013 banks act as both collection and paying agents for customers, participating in interbank clearing and settlement systems to collect, present, be presented with, and pay payment instruments. This enables banks to economize on reserves held for settlement of payments, since inward and outward payments offset each other. It also enables the offsetting of payment flows between geographical areas, reducing the cost of settlement between them.\n# Credit intermediation \u2013 banks borrow and lend back-to-back on their own account as middle men.\n# Credit quality improvement \u2013 banks lend money to ordinary commercial and personal borrowers (ordinary credit quality), but are high quality borrowers. The improvement comes from diversification of the bank's assets and capital which provides a buffer to absorb losses without defaulting on its obligations. However, banknotes and deposits are generally unsecured; if the bank gets into difficulty and pledges assets as security, to raise the funding it needs to continue to operate, this puts the note holders and depositors in an economically subordinated position.\n# [[Asset liability mismatch]]/[[Maturity transformation]] \u2013 banks borrow more on demand debt and short term debt, but provide more long term loans. In other words, they borrow short and lend long. With a stronger credit quality than most other borrowers, banks can do this by aggregating issues (e.g. accepting deposits and issuing banknotes) and redemptions (e.g. withdrawals and redemption of banknotes), maintaining reserves of cash, investing in marketable securities that can be readily converted to cash if needed, and raising replacement funding as needed from various sources (e.g. wholesale cash markets and securities markets).\n# [[Money creation]]/destruction \u2013 whenever a bank gives out a loan in a [[fractional-reserve banking]] system, a new sum of money is created and conversely, whenever the principal on that loan is repaid money is destroyed.\n\n==Bank crisis==\n[[File:Bosakov dom.jpg|thumb|upright=0.55|OTP Bank in [[Pre\u0161ov]] (Slovakia)]]\nBanks are susceptible to many forms of risk which have triggered occasional systemic crises.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/chiararustici/2018/07/24/personal-data-and-the-next-subprime-crisis/#4748d43370aa|title=Personal Data And The Next Subprime Crisis}}</ref> These include [[liquidity risk]] (where many depositors may request withdrawals in excess of available funds), [[credit risk]] (the chance that those who owe money to the bank will not repay it), and [[interest rate risk]] (the possibility that the bank will become unprofitable, if rising interest rates force it to pay relatively more on its deposits than it receives on its loans).\n\nBanking crises have developed many times throughout history when one or more risks have emerged for a banking sector as a whole. Prominent examples include the [[bank run]] that occurred during the [[Great Depression]], the U.S. [[Savings and Loan crisis]] in the 1980s and early 1990s, the [[Japan]]ese banking crisis during the 1990s, and the [[sub-prime mortgage crisis]] in the 2000s.\n\n===Size of global banking industry===\nAssets of the largest 1,000 banks in the world grew by 6.8% in the 2008/2009 financial year to a record US$96.4&nbsp;trillion while profits declined by 85% to US$115&nbsp;billion. Growth in assets in adverse market conditions was largely a result of recapitalization. EU banks held the largest share of the total, 56% in 2008/2009, down from 61% in the previous year. Asian banks' share increased from 12% to 14% during the year, while the share of US banks increased from 11% to 13%.

Central banks also typically have a monopoly on the business of issuing [[banknote]]s. However, in some countries this is not the case. In the UK, for example, the [[Financial Services Authority]] licenses banks, and some commercial banks (such as the [[Bank of Scotland]]) issue their own banknotes in addition to those issued by the [[Bank of England]], the UK government's central bank.\n\n[[File:Basel - Bottabau am Aeschenplatz1.jpg|thumb|Global headquarters of the [[Bank for International Settlements]] in [[Basel]]]]\n\nBanking law is based on a contractual analysis of the relationship between the ''bank'' (defined above) and the ''customer''&nbsp;\u2013 defined as any entity for which the bank agrees to conduct an account.\n\nThe law implies rights and obligations into this relationship as follows:\n* The bank account balance is the financial position between the bank and the customer: when the account is in credit, the bank owes the balance to the customer; when the account is overdrawn, the customer owes the balance to the bank.\n* The bank agrees to pay the customer's checks up to the amount standing to the credit of the customer's account, plus any agreed overdraft limit.\n* The bank may not pay from the customer's account without a mandate from the customer, e.g. a cheque drawn by the customer.\n* The bank agrees to promptly collect the cheques deposited to the customer's account as the customer's agent, and to credit the proceeds to the customer's account.\n* The bank has a right to combine the customer's accounts, since each account is just an aspect of the same credit relationship.\n* The bank has a [[lien]] on cheques deposited to the customer's account, to the extent that the customer is indebted to the bank.\n* The bank must not disclose details of transactions through the customer's account&nbsp;\u2013 unless the customer consents, there is a public duty to disclose, the bank's interests require it, or the law demands it.\n* The bank must not close a customer's account without reasonable notice, since cheques are outstanding in the ordinary course of business for several days.\n\nThese implied contractual terms may be modified by express agreement between the customer and the bank. The statutes and regulations in force within a particular jurisdiction may also modify the above terms and/or create new rights, obligations or limitations relevant to the bank-customer relationship.\n\nSome types of financial institution, such as [[Building Society|building societies]] and [[credit unions]], may be partly or wholly exempt from bank license requirements, and therefore regulated under separate rules.\n\nThe requirements for the issue of a bank license vary between jurisdictions but typically include:\n* Minimum capital\n* Minimum capital ratio\n* 'Fit and Proper' requirements for the bank's controllers, owners, directors, or senior officers\n* Approval of the bank's business plan as being sufficiently prudent and plausible.\n\n==Types of banking==\nBanks' activities can be divided into:\n* [[retail banking]], dealing directly with individuals and small businesses;\n* [[business banking]], providing services to mid-market business;\n* [[corporate banking]], directed at large business entities;\n* [[private banking]], providing wealth management services to [[high-net-worth individual]]s and families;\n* [[investment banking]], relating to activities on the [[financial markets]].\nMost banks are profit-making, private enterprises.

After the [[Great Depression]], the U.S. Congress required that banks only engage in banking activities, whereas investment banks were limited to [[capital market]] activities. Since the two no longer have to be under separate ownership, some use the term \"commercial bank\" to refer to a bank or a division of a bank that mostly deals with deposits and loans from corporations or large businesses.\n* [[Community banks]]: locally operated financial institutions that empower employees to make local decisions to serve their customers and the partners.\n* [[Community development bank]]s: regulated banks that provide financial services and credit to under-served markets or populations.\n* [[Land development bank]]s: The special banks providing long-term loans are called [[land development bank]]s (LDB). The history of LDB is quite old. The first LDB was started at Jhang in [[Punjab]] in 1920. The main objective of the LDBs are to promote the development of land, agriculture and increase the agricultural production. The LDBs provide long-term finance to members  directly through their branches.<ref name=\"agritech\">{{cite web | url=http://agritech.tnau.ac.in/banking/crbank_land_dvpt_bank.html | title=Land Development Bank | publisher=TNAU Agritech Portal | accessdate=8 January 2014 | author=TNAU}}</ref>\n* [[Credit union]]s or [[Cooperative banking|co-operative banks]]: not-for-profit [[cooperatives]] owned by the depositors and often offering rates more favourable than for-profit banks.

Many offshore banks are essentially private banks.\n* [[Savings bank]]: in Europe, savings banks took their roots in the 19th or sometimes even in the 18th century. Their original objective was to provide easily accessible savings products to all strata of the population. In some countries, savings banks were created on public initiative; in others, socially committed individuals created foundations to put in place the necessary infrastructure. Nowadays, European savings banks have kept their focus on retail banking: payments, savings products, credits and insurances for individuals or small and medium-sized enterprises. Apart from this retail focus, they also differ from commercial banks by their broadly decentralized distribution network, providing local and regional outreach&nbsp;\u2013 and by their socially responsible approach to business and society.\n* [[Building societies]] and [[Landesbank]]s: institutions that conduct retail banking.\n* [[Ethical bank]]s: banks that prioritize the transparency of all operations and make only what they consider to be socially responsible investments.\n* A [[Direct bank|direct or internet-only bank]] is a banking operation without any physical bank branches. Transactions are usually accomplished using [[Automated teller machine|ATMs]] and [[Electronic funds transfer|electronic transfers]] and [[direct deposit]]s through an online interface.\n\n===Types of investment banks===\n* [[Investment bank]]s \"[[underwrite]]\" (guarantee the sale of) stock and bond issues, trade for their own accounts, make markets, provide [[investment management]], and advise corporations on [[capital market]] activities such as mergers and acquisitions.\n* [[Merchant bank]]s were traditionally banks which engaged in [[trade finance]]. The modern definition, however, refers to banks which provide capital to firms in the form of shares rather than loans. Unlike [[venture cap]]s, they tend not to invest in new companies.\n\n===Combination banks===\n[[File:BDO Bank in SM Aura, BGC.jpg|thumb|A [[Branch (banking)|branch]] of [[Banco de Oro]] in [[Metro Manila]], [[Philippines]]]]\n[[File:Avenida Sao Joao, Sao Paulo 2006.jpg|thumb|A [[Banco do Brasil]] office in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], [[Brazil]], the bank is the largest financial institution in Brazil and [[Latin America]].]]\n\n* [[Universal bank]]s, more commonly known as [[financial services]] companies, engage in several of these activities. These big banks are very diversified groups that, among other services, also distribute insurance&nbsp;\u2013  hence the term [[bancassurance]], a [[portmanteau|portmanteau word]] combining \"banque or bank\" and \"assurance\", signifying that both banking and insurance are provided by the same corporate entity.\n\n===Other types of banks===\n* [[Central bank]]s are normally government-owned and charged with quasi-regulatory responsibilities, such as supervising commercial banks, or controlling the cash [[interest rate]]. They generally provide liquidity to the banking system and act as the [[lender of last resort]] in event of a crisis.\n* [[Islamic bank]]s adhere to the concepts of [[Sharia|Islamic law]]. This form of banking revolves around several well-established principles based on Islamic canons. All banking activities must avoid interest, a concept that is forbidden in Islam. Instead, the bank earns profit ([[Markup (business)|markup]]) and fees on the financing facilities that it extends to customers.\n\n==Challenges within the banking industry==\n{{Globalize|section|date=September 2009}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2008}}\n\n===United States===\n{{Main|Banking in the United States}}\n[[File:People's Trust Company Building 183 Montague Street Brooklyn.jpg|upright=0.8|thumb|right|[[Citibank]], The People's Trust Company Building, [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]].]]\n\nThe United States banking industry is one of the most heavily regulated and guarded in the world,<ref>Scott Besley and Eugene F. Brigham, ''Principles of Finance'', 4th ed. (Mason, OH: South-Western Cengage Learning, 2009), 125.  This popular university textbook explains: \"Generally speaking, U.S. financial institutions have been much more heavily regulated and faced greater limitations ... than have their foreign counterparts.\"</ref> with multiple specialized and focused regulators. All banks with FDIC-insured deposits have the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) as a regulator. However, for soundness examinations (i.e., whether a bank is operating in a sound manner), the [[Federal Reserve]] is the primary federal regulator for Fed-member state banks; the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]] (OCC) is the primary federal regulator for national banks. State non-member banks are examined by the state agencies as well as the FDIC. National banks have one primary regulator&nbsp;\u2013 the OCC.\n\nEach regulatory agency has their own set of rules and regulations to which banks and thrifts must adhere.\nThe [[Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council]] (FFIEC) was established in 1979 as a formal inter-agency body empowered to prescribe uniform principles, standards, and report forms for the federal examination of financial institutions. Although the FFIEC has resulted in a greater degree of regulatory consistency between the agencies, the rules and regulations are constantly changing.\n\nIn addition to changing regulations, changes in the industry have led to consolidations within the Federal Reserve, FDIC, OTS, and OCC. Offices have been closed, supervisory regions have been merged, staff levels have been reduced and budgets have been cut. The remaining regulators face an increased burden with increased workload and more banks per regulator. While banks struggle to keep up with the changes in the regulatory environment, regulators struggle to manage their workload and effectively regulate their banks. The impact of these changes is that banks are receiving less hands-on assessment by the regulators, less time spent with each institution, and the potential for more problems slipping through the cracks, potentially resulting in an overall increase in bank failures across the United States.\n\nThe changing economic environment has a significant impact on banks and thrifts as they struggle to effectively manage their interest rate spread in the face of low rates on loans, rate competition for deposits and the general market changes, industry trends and economic fluctuations. It has been a challenge for banks to effectively set their growth strategies with the recent economic market. A rising interest rate environment may seem to help financial institutions, but the effect of the changes on consumers and businesses is not predictable and the challenge remains for banks to grow and effectively manage the spread to generate a return to their shareholders.\n\nThe management of the banks\u2019 asset portfolios also remains a challenge in today's economic environment. Loans are a bank's primary asset category and when loan quality becomes suspect, the foundation of a bank is shaken to the core. While always an issue for banks, declining [[asset quality]] has become a big problem for financial institutions.\n[[File:Mirror building (4004925857).jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|right|[[Safra National Bank]], New York]]\nThere are several reasons for this, one of which is the lax attitude some banks have adopted because of the years of \u201cgood times.\u201d The potential for this is exacerbated by the reduction in the regulatory oversight of banks and in some cases depth of management. Problems are more likely to go undetected, resulting in a significant impact on the bank when they are discovered. In addition, banks, like any business, struggle to cut costs and have consequently eliminated certain expenses, such as adequate employee training programs.\n\nBanks also face a host of other challenges such as ageing ownership groups. Across the country, many banks\u2019 management teams and board of directors are ageing. Banks also face ongoing pressure by shareholders, both public and private, to achieve earnings and growth projections. Regulators place added pressure on banks to manage the various categories of risk. Banking is also an extremely competitive industry. Competing in the financial services industry has become tougher with the entrance of such players as insurance agencies, credit unions, cheque cashing services, credit card companies, etc.\n\nAs a reaction, banks have developed their activities in [[financial instruments]], through [[financial market]] operations such as [[brokerage firm|brokerage]] and have become big players in such activities.\n\nAnother major challenge is the ageing infrastructure, also called legacy IT. Backend systems were built decades ago and are incompatible to new applications.

The phenomenon of [[disintermediation]] had to dollars moving from savings accounts and into direct market instruments such as [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Department of Treasury]] obligations, agency securities, and corporate debt. One of the greatest factors in recent years in the movement of deposits was the tremendous growth of money market funds whose higher interest rates attracted consumer deposits.<ref name=\"multiple3\">{{cite book |author1=Mishler, Lon |author2=Cole, Robert E. |title=Consumer and business credit management |publisher=Irwin |location=Homewood |year=1995 |pages=128\u201329 |isbn=978-0-256-13948-8 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref>\n\nTo compete for deposits, US savings institutions offer many different types of plans:<ref name=\"multiple3\"/>\n* [[Passbook]] or ordinary [[deposit account]]s &nbsp;\u2013  permit any amount to be added to or withdrawn from the account at any time.\n* NOW and Super NOW accounts &nbsp;\u2013  function like checking accounts but earn interest. A minimum balance may be required on Super NOW accounts.\n* [[Money market account]]s &nbsp;\u2013  carry a monthly limit of preauthorized transfers to other accounts or persons and may require a minimum or average balance.\n* Certificate accounts &nbsp;\u2013  subject to loss of some or all interest on withdrawals before maturity.\n* Notice accounts &nbsp;\u2013  the equivalent of certificate accounts with an indefinite term. Savers agree to notify the institution a specified time before withdrawal.\n* [[Individual retirement account]]s (IRAs) and [[Keogh plan]]s &nbsp;\u2013  a form of retirement savings in which the funds deposited and interest earned are exempt from income tax until after withdrawal.\n* [[Checking account]]s &nbsp;\u2013  offered by some institutions under definite restrictions.\n* All withdrawals and deposits are completely the sole decision and responsibility of the account owner unless the parent or guardian is required to do otherwise for legal reasons.\n* Club accounts and other [[savings account]]s &nbsp;\u2013  designed to help people save regularly to meet certain goals.\n\n== Types of accounts ==\n[[File:BBTLexington.jpg|thumb|Suburban bank branch]]\n[[Bank statement]]s are accounting records produced by banks under the various accounting standards of the world. Under [[Generally accepted accounting principles|GAAP]] there are two kinds of accounts: debit and credit. Credit accounts are Revenue, Equity and Liabilities. Debit Accounts are Assets and Expenses. The bank credits a ''credit account'' to increase its balance, and debits a ''credit account'' to decrease its balance.<ref>{{cite book | title= Monetary and Financial Statistics: Compilation Guide | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=a03zkw-5fcEC | author= Statistics Department | year= 2001 | page= 24 | chapter= Source Data for Monetary and Financial Statistics | chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=a03zkw-5fcEC&pg=PT36 | publisher= [[International Monetary Fund]] | location= [[Washington D.C.]] | isbn= 978-1-58906-584-0 | accessdate= 2009-03-14}}</ref>\n\nThe customer debits his or her savings/bank (asset) account in his ledger when making a deposit (and the account is normally in debit), while the customer credits a credit card (liability) account in his ledger every time he spends money (and the account is normally in credit). When the customer reads his bank statement, the statement will show a credit to the account for deposits, and debits for withdrawals of funds. The customer with a positive balance will see this balance reflected as a credit balance on the bank statement. If the customer is overdrawn, he will have a negative balance, reflected as a debit balance on the bank statement.\n\n===Brokered deposits===\nOne source of deposits for banks is brokers who deposit large sums of money on behalf of investors through trust corporations. This money will generally go to the banks which offer the most favourable terms, often better than those offered local depositors. It is possible for a bank to engage in business with no local deposits at all, all funds being brokered deposits. Accepting a significant quantity of such deposits, or \"[[hot money]]\" as it is sometimes called, puts a bank in a difficult and sometimes risky position, as the funds must be lent or invested in a way that yields a return sufficient to pay the high interest being paid on the brokered deposits. This may result in risky decisions and even in eventual failure of the bank. Banks which failed during 2008 and 2009 in the United States during the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132008|global financial crisis]] had, on average, four times more brokered deposits as a percent of their deposits than the average bank. Such deposits, combined with risky real estate investments, factored into the [[savings and loan crisis]] of the 1980s. Regulation of brokered deposits is opposed by banks on the grounds that the practice can be a source of external funding to growing communities with insufficient local deposits.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/04/business/04brokered.html |title=For Banks, Wads of Cash and Loads of Trouble |first=Eric |last=Lipton |author-link=Eric Lipton |first2=Andrew |last2=Martin |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=3 July 2009 |access-date=13 July 2018 |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |location=Macon, Ga}}</ref> There are different types of accounts: saving, recurring and current accounts.\n\n===Custodial accounts===\nCustodial accounts are accounts in which assets are held for a third party. For example, businesses that accept custody of funds for clients prior to their conversion, return or transfer may have a custodial account at a bank for this purposes.\n\n==Globalization in the banking industry==\nIn modern time there has been huge reductions to the barriers of global competition in the banking industry. Increases in telecommunications and other financial technologies, such as Bloomberg, have allowed banks to extend their reach all over the world, since they no longer have to be near customers to manage both their finances and their risk. The growth in cross-border activities has also increased the demand for banks that can provide various services across borders to different nationalities.\nHowever, despite these reductions in barriers and growth in cross-border activities, the banking industry is nowhere near as globalized as some other industries. In the US, for instance, very few banks even worry about the Riegle\u2013Neal Act, which promotes more efficient interstate banking. In the vast majority of nations around the globe the market share for foreign owned banks is currently less than a tenth of all market shares for banks in a particular nation.\nOne reason the banking industry has not been fully globalized is that it is more convenient to have local banks provide loans to small business and individuals. On the other hand, for large corporations, it is not as important in what nation the bank is in, since the corporation's financial information is available around the globe.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://scholar.google.nl/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=WXWj19cAAAAJ&citation_for_view=WXWj19cAAAAJ:9yKSN-GCB0IC |title=To what extent will the banking industry be globalized?

Quarterback Matt McGloin scored the first touchdown in team history on their first possession, a one-yard score that put them up 6-0. McGloin would later find [[Colby Pearson]] for a passing touchdown. Defensively, the Guardians forced three turnovers, including a fumble return for a touchdown by [[Jamar Summers]]. Tampa Bay reached the [[red zone]] five times, but emerged only with a field goal thanks to a standout defensive effort.\n\nThe Guardians' first road game saw them become the victims of the first shutout in the new XFL's history, as they fell to the [[DC Defenders]] by a 27-0 final at [[Audi Field]]. The game became notable for a McGloin sideline interview with ABC/ESPN's [[Dianna Russini]], in which he was very critical of the team's offensive gameplan. McGloin was eventually pulled from the game for backup [[Marquise Williams]] in the second half. \n\nNew York's next game was a visit to [[The Dome at America's Center]] to take on the [[St. Louis BattleHawks]]. Another one-sided loss awaited the Guardians, as they fell by a 29-9 final in St. Louis' home opener. McGloin was injured on the Guardians' first possession. He returned to the game, but missed the entire second half. New York did manage to end a streak of 26 consecutive possessions without a touchdown when third-string quarterback [[Luis Perez (American football)|Luis Perez]] found [[Austin Duke]] for an eight-yard score in the fourth quarter. \n\nWith McGloin out with an injury, Perez was the Guardians' starting quarterback for their Week 4 return to MetLife Stadium. Assisted by a strong rushing attack, Perez was able to guide the Guardians to a 17-14 victory over the [[Los Angeles Wildcats (XFL)|Los Angeles Wildcats]]. The Guardians tallied 122 yards on the ground, led by a tally of 82 from [[Darius Victor]]. New York took the lead for good on a 47-yard field goal from [[Matthew McCrane]], which was set up by a Summers interception. [[Jarrell Owens]] led the way defensively for the Guardians with two sacks and a blocked field goal. \n\nPerez earned another start when the Guardians hit the road again, taking on the [[Dallas Renegades]] at [[Globe Life Park in Arlington]]. The Guardians would go on to put up their most dominant effort of the season, crushing the Renegades by a 30-12 final. New York's key to victory was a series of 21 unanswered points in the third quarter. Williams came in to score a rushing touchdown from one yard out before Perez hooked up with Pearson for an 80-yard touchdown pass, the longest play in Guardians history. Linebacker [[Ryan Mueller]] capped the barrage off by returning an interception for a touchdown, the Guardians' second defensive score of the season. New York once again had a stellar rushing day, earning 144 yards on the ground. Victor once again led the way, this time with 58 of those yards.\n\nThe Guardians were set to take on the undefeated [[Houston Roughnecks]] at MetLife Stadium prior to the XFL's decision to suspend its season due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].

Quarterback Matt McGloin scored the first touchdown in team history on their first possession, a one-yard score that put them up 6-0. McGloin would later find [[Colby Pearson]] for a passing touchdown. Defensively, the Guardians forced three turnovers, including a fumble return for a touchdown by [[Jamar Summers]]. Tampa Bay reached the [[red zone]] five times, but emerged only with a field goal thanks to a standout defensive effort.\n\nThe Guardians' first road game saw them become the victims of the first shutout in the new XFL's history, as they fell to the [[DC Defenders]] by a 27-0 final at [[Audi Field]]. The game became notable for a McGloin sideline interview with ABC/ESPN's [[Dianna Russini]], in which he was very critical of the team's offensive gameplan. McGloin was eventually pulled from the game for backup [[Marquise Williams]] in the second half. \n\nNew York's next game was a visit to [[The Dome at America's Center]] to take on the [[St. Louis BattleHawks]]. Another one-sided loss awaited the Guardians, as they fell by a 29-9 final in St. Louis' home opener. McGloin was injured on the Guardians' first possession. He returned to the game, but missed the entire second half. New York did manage to end a streak of 26 consecutive possessions without a touchdown when third-string quarterback [[Luis Perez]] found [[Austin Duke]] for an eight-yard score in the fourth quarter. \n\nWith McGloin out with an injury, Perez was the Guardians' starting quarterback for their Week 4 return to MetLife Stadium. Assisted by a strong rushing attack, Perez was able to guide the Guardians to a 17-14 victory over the [[Los Angeles Wildcats (XFL)|Los Angeles Wildcats]]. The Guardians tallied 122 yards on the ground, led by a tally of 82 from [[Darius Victor]]. New York took the lead for good on a 47-yard field goal from [[Matthew McCrane]], which was set up by a Summers interception. [[Jarrell Owens]] led the way defensively for the Guardians with two sacks and a blocked field goal. \n\nPerez earned another start when the Guardians hit the road again, taking on the [[Dallas Renegades]] at [[Globe Life Park in Arlington]]. The Guardians would go on to put up their most dominant effort of the season, crushing the Renegades by a 30-12 final. New York's key to victory was a series of 21 unanswered points in the third quarter. Williams came in to score a rushing touchdown from one yard out before Perez hooked up with Pearson for an 80-yard touchdown pass, the longest play in Guardians history. Linebacker [[Ryan Mueller]] capped the barrage off by returning an interception for a touchdown, the Guardians' second defensive score of the season. New York once again had a stellar rushing day, earning 144 yards on the ground. Victor once again led the way, this time with 58 of those yards.\n\nThe Guardians were set to take on the undefeated [[Houston Roughnecks]] at MetLife Stadium prior to the XFL's decision to suspend its season due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].

Beginning in the nineteenth century, with the development of [[academic history]], there developed a body of historiographic literature. The extent to which historians are influenced by their own groups and loyalties\u2014such as [[Nationalist historiography|to their nation state]]\u2014remains a debated question.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ferro, Marc|title=The Use and Abuse of History: Or How the Past Is Taught to Children|date=2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author1=Candelaria, John Lee |author2=Alporha, Veronica |year=2018 |title=Readings in Philippine History }}</ref>\n\nIn the [[ancient world]], chronological [[annal]]s were produced in civilizations such as [[ancient Egypt]] and [[Ancient Near East|Mesopotamia]]. However, the discipline of historiography was first established in the 5th century BC with the ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' of [[Herodotus]], the founder of [[Greek historiography]]. The [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] statesman [[Cato the Elder]] produced the first [[Roman historiography|history in Latin]], the ''[[Origines]]'', in the 2nd century BC. His near contemporaries [[Sima Tan]] and [[Sima Qian]] in the [[Han Empire]] of [[Ancient China|China]] established [[Chinese historiography]] with the compiling of the ''[[Shiji]]'' (''Records of the Grand Historian''). During the [[Middle Ages]], [[medieval historiography]] included the works of [[chronicle]]s in [[Medieval literature|medieval Europe]], [[Islamic literature|Islamic histories]] by [[Muslim historians]], and the [[Korean historiography|Korean]] and [[Japanese historiography|Japanese]] historical writings based on the existing Chinese model. During the 18th century [[Age of Enlightenment]], historiography in the Western world was shaped and developed by figures such as [[Voltaire]], [[David Hume]], and [[Edward Gibbon]], who among others set the foundations for the modern discipline.\n\nThe research interests of historians change over time, and there has been a shift away from traditional diplomatic, economic, and political history toward newer approaches, especially social and [[Postcolonialism|cultural studies]]. From 1975 to 1995 the proportion of professors of history in American universities identifying with social history increased from 31 to 41 percent, while the proportion of political historians decreased from 40 to 30 percent.<ref>Diplomatic dropped from 5% to 3%, economic history from 7% to 5%, and cultural history grew from 14% to 16%.

In that sense certain [[Official history|official historians]] were given the title \"[[Historiographer Royal]]\" in [[Rikshistoriograf|Sweden]] (from 1618), [[Historiographer Royal (England)|England]] (from 1660), and [[Historiographer Royal (Scotland)|Scotland]] (from 1681). The Scottish post is still in existence.\n\nHistoriography was more recently defined as \"the study of the way history has been and is written&nbsp;\u2013 the history of historical writing\", which means that, \"When you study 'historiography' you do not study the events of the past directly, but the changing interpretations of those events in the works of individual historians.\"<ref>{{cite book |first1=Conal |last1=Furay |first2= Michael J. |last2=Salevouris |title=The Methods and Skills of History: A Practical Guide |publisher=[[Harlan Davidson (publisher)|Harlan Davidson]]<!-- This was a family-owned higher educational publishing house that was started in 1976 by someone with the surname Davidson and was sold to John Wiley & Sons in 2012, according to an Article in Publisher's Weekly. -->  |year=1988 |page=223 |isbn=0-88295-982-4}})</ref>\n\n==Antiquity==\n{{see|Ancient history}}\nUnderstanding the past appears to be a universal human need, and the \"telling of history\" has emerged independently in civilizations around the world. \nWhat constitutes history is a philosophical question (see [[philosophy of history]]).\n\nThe earliest [[Chronology|chronologies]] date back to [[Mesopotamia]] and [[ancient Egypt]], in the form of [[chronicle]]s and [[annal]]s. However, no historical writers in these early civilizations were known by name. By contrast, the term \"historiography\" is taken to refer to written history recorded in a narrative format for the purpose of informing future generations about events. In this limited sense, \"ancient history\" begins with the early historiography of [[Classical Antiquity]], in about the 5th century BCE.\n\n===Europe===\n====Greece====\n{{main|Greek historiography}}\n{{further|Ancient Greek literature}}\n[[File:Thucydides Manuscript.jpg|thumb|upright|Reproduction of part of a tenth-century copy of [[Thucydides]]'s ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]''.]]\n\nThe earliest known systematic historical thought emerged in [[ancient Greece]], a development which would be an important influence on the writing of history elsewhere around [[History of the Mediterranean region|the Mediterranean]] region. Greek historians greatly contributed to the development of historical methodology. The earliest known critical historical works were ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'', composed by [[Herodotus|Herodotus of Halicarnassus]] (484\u2013425 BCE) who became known as the \"father of history\".<ref>John L. Myres, ''Herodotus, Father of History'' (1953).</ref> Herodotus attempted to distinguish between more and less reliable accounts, and personally conducted research by travelling extensively, giving written accounts of various Mediterranean cultures. Although Herodotus' overall emphasis lay on the actions and characters of men, he also attributed an important role to divinity in the determination of historical events.\n\n[[File:Thucydides-bust-cutout ROM.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|Bust of Thucydides, Hellenistic copy of a 4th-century BC work]]\n\nThe generation following Herodotus witnessed a spate of local histories of the individual [[city-state]]s (''[[polis|poleis]]''), written by the first of the [[Local history|local historians]] who employed the written archives of city and sanctuary. [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] characterized these historians as the forerunners of Thucydides,<ref>Dionysius, ''On Thucydides'', 5.</ref> and these local histories continued to be written into [[Late Antiquity]], as long as the city-states survived. Two early figures stand out: [[Hippias of Elis]], who produced the lists of winners in the Olympic Games that provided the basic chronological framework as long as the pagan classical tradition lasted, and [[Hellanicus of Lesbos]], who compiled more than two dozen histories from civic records, all of them now lost.\n\n[[Thucydides]] largely eliminated divine causality in his account of the war between Athens and Sparta, establishing a rationalistic element which set a precedent for subsequent Western historical writings. He was also the first to distinguish between cause and immediate origins of an event, while his successor [[Xenophon]] ({{c.|lk=no|431}}&nbsp;\u2013 {{annum|355|BCE}}) introduced autobiographical elements and character studies in his ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]''.\n\nThe proverbial [[Philippic]] attacks of the Athenian orator [[Demosthenes]] ({{annum|384\u2013322|BCE}}) on [[Philip&nbsp;II of Macedon]] marked the height of ancient political agitation. The now lost history of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander's]] campaigns by the [[diadoch]] [[Ptolemy&nbsp;I]] ({{annum|367\u2013283|BCE}}) may represent the first historical work composed by a ruler. [[Polybius]] ({{c.|lk=no|203}}&nbsp;\u2013 {{annum|120|BCE}}) wrote on the rise of Rome to world prominence, and attempted to harmonize the Greek and Roman points of view.\n\nThe [[Chaldea]]n priest [[Berossus]] ({{annum|{{floruit|3rd century}}|BCE}}) composed a Greek-language ''History of [[Babylonia]]'' for the [[Seleucid]] king [[Antiochus&nbsp;I]], combining [[Hellenistic]] methods of historiography and [[Mesopotamia]]n accounts to form a unique composite. Reports exist of other near-eastern histories, such as that of the Phoenician historian [[Sanchuniathon]]; but he is considered semi-legendary and writings attributed to him are fragmentary, known only through the later historians [[Philo of Byblos]] and [[Eusebius]], who asserted that he wrote before even the [[Trojan war]].\n\n====Rome====\n{{Main|Roman historiography}}\n{{further|Latin literature}}\n[[File:Marco Porcio Caton Major.jpg|thumb|upright|The Roman [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] of historian [[Cato the Elder]]]]\n\n[[Ancient Romans|The Romans]] adopted the Greek tradition, writing at first in Greek, but eventually chronicling their history in a freshly non-Greek language. While early [[Roman literature|Roman works]] were still written in Greek, the ''Origines'', composed by the Roman statesman [[Cato the Elder]] ({{annum|234\u2013149|BCE}}), was written in Latin, in a conscious effort to counteract Greek cultural influence. It marked the beginning of Latin historical writings. Hailed for its lucid style, [[Julius Caesar]]'s ({{annum|100\u201344|BCE}}) ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico|de Bello Gallico]]'' exemplifies autobiographical war coverage. The politician and orator [[Cicero]] ({{annum|106\u201343|BCE}}) introduced rhetorical elements in his political writings.\n\n[[Strabo]] ({{annum|63|BCE}}&nbsp;\u2013 {{annum|{{c.|lk=no|24}}|[[Common Era|CE]]}}) was an important exponent of the [[Greco-Roman]] tradition of combining geography with history, presenting a descriptive history of peoples and places known to his era. [[Livy]] ({{annum|59|BCE}}&nbsp;\u2013 {{annum|17|CE}}) records the rise of [[Roman Empire|Rome]] from [[city-state]] to [[empire]].

His work superseded the older style of the ''[[Spring and Autumn Annals]]'', compiled in the 5th century BC, the ''[[Bamboo Annals]]'' and other court and dynastic [[annals]] that recorded history in a [[chronological]] form that abstained from [[analysis]]. Sima's ''[[Shiji]]'' (''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'') pioneered the \"Annals-biography\" format, which would become the standard for prestige history writing in China. In this genre a history opens with a chronological outline of court affairs, and then continues with detailed biographies of prominent people who lived during the period in question.<ref>Thomas R. Martin, ''Herodotus and Sima Qian: The First Great Historians of Greece and China: A Brief History with Documents'' (2009).</ref> The scope of his work extended as far back as the {{annum|16th century|BCE}}, and included many treatises on specific subjects and individual biographies of prominent people. He also explored the lives and deeds of commoners, both contemporary and those of previous eras.\n\nWhereas Sima's had been a universal history from the beginning of time down to the time of writing, his successor [[Ban Gu]] wrote an annals-biography history limiting its coverage to only the [[Western Han dynasty]], the [[Book of Han]] (96 CE). This established the notion of using dynastic boundaries as start- and end-points, and most later Chinese histories would focus on a single dynasty or group of dynasties.\n\nThe Records of the Grand Historian and Book of Han were eventually joined by the [[Book of the Later Han]] (488 CE) (replacing the earlier, and now only partially extant, Han Records from the Eastern Pavilion) and the [[Records of the Three Kingdoms]] (297 CE) to form the \"Four Histories\". These became mandatory reading for the [[Imperial Examinations]] and have therefore exerted an influence on Chinese culture comparable to the [[Thirteen Classics|Confucian Classics]]. More annals-biography histories were written in subsequent dynasties, eventually bringing the number to between twenty-four and twenty-six, but none ever reached the popularity and impact of the first four.<ref>Wilkinson 2018, pp. 692-695</ref>\n\nTraditional Chinese historiography describes history in terms of [[dynastic cycle]]s. In this view, each new dynasty is founded by a morally righteous founder. Over time, the dynasty becomes morally corrupt and dissolute. Eventually, the dynasty becomes so weak as to allow its replacement by a new dynasty.<ref>{{cite book|author=J\u00f6rn R\u00fcsen|title=Time and History: The Variety of Cultures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SvGyzu-nLaUC&pg=PA54|year=2007|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-1-84545-349-7|pages=54\u201355}}</ref>\n\nIn 281 CE the tomb of [[King Xiang of Wei]] (d. 296 BC) was opened, inside of which was found a historical text called the [[Bamboo Annals]], after the writing material. It is similar in style to the Spring and Autumn Annals and covers the time from the [[Yellow Emperor]] to 299 BC. Opinions on the authenticity of the text has varied throughout the centuries, and in any event it was re-discovered too late to gain anything like the same status as the Spring and Autumn.<ref>Wilkinson, Endymion.

In the [[Early Christianity|first Christian centuries]], the [[Development of the New Testament canon|New Testament canon was developed]]. The [[Early centers of Christianity|growth of Christianity]] and its enhanced status in the Roman Empire after [[Constantine I and Christianity|Constantine&nbsp;I]] (see [[State church of the Roman Empire]]) led to the development of a distinct Christian historiography, influenced by both [[Christian theology]] and the nature of the [[Christian Bible]], encompassing new areas of study and views of history.  The central role of the Bible in Christianity is reflected in the preference of Christian historians for written sources, compared to the classical historians' preference for oral sources and is also reflected in the inclusion of politically unimportant people. Christian historians also focused on development of religion and society.  This can be seen in the extensive inclusion of written sources in the ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Ecclesiastical History]]'' written by [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] around 324 and in the subjects it covers.<ref name=\"sxixkf\">[http://www.cuw.edu/Academics/programs/history/historiography.html ''Historiography''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018032745/http://www.cuw.edu/Academics/programs/history/historiography.html |date=2007-10-18 }}, Concordia University Wisconsin, retrieved on 2 November 2007</ref>  Christian theology considered time as linear, progressing according to divine plan.  As God's plan encompassed everyone, Christian histories in this period had a universal approach.

Some writers in the period did construct a more [[narrative]] form of history. These included [[Gregory of Tours]] and more successfully [[Bede]], who wrote both [[secular]] and [[ecclesiastical]] history and who is known for writing the ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]''.<ref name = \"sxixkf\"/>\n\nDuring the [[Renaissance]], history was written about states or nations. The study of history changed during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and [[Romanticism]]. [[Voltaire]] described the history of certain ages that he considered important, rather than describing events in chronological order. History became an independent discipline.

In order to evaluate these sources, various methodologies were developed, such as the \"[[Ilm ar-Rijal|science of biography]]\", \"[[science of hadith]]\" and \"[[Isnad]]\" (chain of transmission).

Among the many Italians who contributed to this were [[Leonardo Bruni]] (c. 1370\u20131444), [[Francesco Guicciardini]] (1483\u20131540), and [[Caesar Baronius|Cesare Baronio]] (1538\u20131607).\n\n===Voltaire===\nFrench ''[[Philosophes|philosophe]]'' [[Voltaire]] (1694\u20131778) had an enormous influence on the development of historiography during the Age of Enlightenment through his demonstration of fresh new ways to look at the past. Guillaume de Syon argues:\n:Voltaire recast historiography in both factual and analytical terms. Not only did he reject traditional biographies and accounts that claim the work of supernatural forces, but he went so far as to suggest that earlier historiography was rife with falsified evidence and required new investigations at the source. Such an outlook was not unique in that the scientific spirit that 18th-century intellectuals perceived themselves as invested with. A rationalistic approach was key to rewriting history.<ref>Guillaume de Syon, \"Voltaire,\" in {{cite book|author=Kelly Boyd. ed.|title=Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing, vol 2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0121vD9STIMC&pg=PA1270|date=1999|publisher=Taylor & Francis|pages=1270\u201372|isbn=9781884964336}}</ref>\n\nVoltaire's best-known histories are ''[[The Age of Louis XIV]]'' (1751), and his ''[[Essai sur les m\u0153urs et l'esprit des nations|Essay on the Customs and the Spirit of the Nations]]'' (1756). He broke from the tradition of narrating diplomatic and military events, and emphasized customs, social history and achievements in the arts and sciences. He was the first scholar to make a serious attempt to write the history of the world, eliminating theological frameworks, and emphasizing economics, culture and political history. Although he repeatedly warned against political bias on the part of the historian, he did not miss many opportunities to expose the intolerance and frauds of the church over the ages. Voltaire advised scholars that anything contradicting the normal course of nature was not to be believed. Although he found evil in the historical record, he fervently believed reason and educating the illiterate masses would lead to progress.\n\nVoltaire explains his view of historiography in his article on \"History\" in Diderot's ''[[Encyclop\u00e9die]]'': ''\"One demands of modern historians more details, better ascertained facts, precise dates, more attention to customs, laws, mores, commerce, finance, agriculture, population.\"'' Already in 1739 he had written: ''\"My chief object is not political or military history, it is the history of the arts, of commerce, of civilization&nbsp;\u2013 in a word,&nbsp;\u2013 of the human mind.\"''<ref>{{cite book|author=E.

Hume adopted a similar scope to Voltaire in his history; as well as the history of Kings, Parliaments, and armies, he examined the history of culture, including literature and science, as well. His short biographies of leading scientists explored the process of scientific change and he developed new ways of seeing scientists in the context of their times by looking at how they interacted with society and each other&nbsp;\u2013 he paid special attention to [[Francis Bacon]], [[Robert Boyle]], [[Isaac Newton]] and [[William Harvey]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wertz | first1 = S.

Rosenberg, ''Carlyle and the Burden of History''  (1985).</ref> Carlyle's style of historical writing stressed the immediacy of action, often using the present tense.  He emphasised the role of forces of the spirit in history and thought that chaotic events demanded what he called 'heroes' to take control over the competing forces erupting within society. He considered the dynamic forces of history as being the hopes and aspirations of people that took the form of ideas, and were often ossified into ideologies. Carlyle's ''The French Revolution'' was written in a highly unorthodox style, far removed from the neutral and detached tone of the tradition of Gibbon. Carlyle presented the history as dramatic events unfolding in the present as though he and the reader were participants on the streets of Paris at the famous events.  Carlyle's invented style was epic poetry combined with philosophical treatise. It is rarely read or cited in the last century.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cobban | first1 = Alfred | year = 1963 | title = Carlyle's French Revolution | url = | journal = History | volume = 48 | issue = 164| pages = 306\u201316 | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-229x.1963.tb02321.x }}</ref><ref>Mark Cumming, ''A Disimprisoned Epic: Form and Vision in Carlyle's French Revolution'' (1988).</ref>\n\n===French historians: Michelet and Taine===\n[[File:Jules Michelet portrait older.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Jules Michelet (1798\u20131874), later in his career.]]\n[[File:Hippolyte taine.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Hippolyte Taine (1828\u20131893)]]\n\nIn his main work ''Histoire de France'' (1855), French historian [[Jules Michelet]] (1798\u20131874) coined the term [[Renaissance]] (meaning \"rebirth\" in [[French language|French]]), as a period in Europe's cultural history that represented a break from the Middle Ages, creating a modern understanding of humanity and its place in the world.<ref>{{cite book|authorlink1=Jerry Brotton|last=Brotton|first=Jerry|title=The Renaissance Bazaar|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=21\u201322}}</ref> The 19-volume work covered French history from [[Charlemagne]] to the outbreak of the [[French Revolution]].

He had a decisive impact on scholars.

According to [[John Lukacs]], he was the first master of cultural history, which seeks to describe the spirit and the forms of expression of a particular age, a particular people, or a particular place.  His innovative approach to historical research stressed the importance of art and its inestimable value as a primary source for the study of history. He was one of the first historians to rise above the narrow nineteenth-century notion that \"history is past politics and politics current history.<ref>John Lukacs, Remembered Past: John Lukacs on History, Historians, and Historical Knowledge, ed.

Nelson, Wilmington, DE: ISI Books, 2004, p. 215.</ref>\n\nBy the mid-19th century, scholars were beginning to analyse the history of institutional change, particularly the development of constitutional government. [[William Stubbs]]'s  ''Constitutional History of England'' (3 vols., 1874\u201378) was an important influence on this developing field. The work traced the development of the English constitution from the Teutonic invasions of Britain until 1485, and marked a distinct step in the advance of English historical learning.<ref>[[s:A Short Biographical Dictionary of English Literature/Stubbs, William]]</ref> He argued that the theory of the unity and continuity of history should not remove distinctions between ancient and modern history. He believed that, though work on ancient history is a useful preparation for the study of modern history, either may advantageously be studied apart.

[[Leopold von Ranke]] (1795\u20131886) at Berlin was a pivotal influence in this regard, and was the founder of modern source-based history.<ref>Frederick C.

Beginning with his first book in 1824, the ''History of the Latin and Teutonic Peoples from 1494 to 1514'', Ranke used an unusually wide variety of sources for a historian of the age, including \"memoirs, diaries, personal and formal missives, government documents, diplomatic dispatches and first-hand accounts of eye-witnesses\". Over a career that spanned much of the century, Ranke set the standards for much of later historical writing, introducing such ideas as reliance on [[primary source]]s, an emphasis on [[narrative history]] and especially international politics (''aussenpolitik'').<ref>E. Sreedharan, ''A textbook of historiography, 500&nbsp;BC to AD&nbsp;2000'' (2004) p. 185</ref>  Sources had to be solid, not speculations and rationalizations. His credo was to write history the way it was. He insisted on primary sources with proven authenticity.\n\nRanke also rejected the 'teleological approach' to history, which traditionally viewed each period as inferior to the period which follows. In Ranke's view, the historian had to understand a period on its own terms, and seek to find only the general ideas which animated every period of history. In 1831 and at the behest of the [[Prussia]]n government, Ranke founded and edited the first historical journal in the world, called ''Historisch-Politische Zeitschrift''.\n\nAnother important German thinker was [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], whose theory of historical progress ran counter to Ranke's approach. In Hegel's own words, his philosophical theory of \"World history... represents the development of the spirit's consciousness of its own [[Freedom of will|freedom]] and of the consequent realization of this freedom.\".<ref>''Lectures'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=pjfaimuprzoC&pg=PA138&hl=en&dq=%22represents+the+development+of+the+spirit's+consciousness+of+its+own+freedom+and+of+the+consequent+realisation+of+this+freedom.%22 p. 138].</ref> This realization is seen by studying the various cultures that have developed over the millennia, and trying to understand the way that freedom has worked itself out through them:\n\n<blockquote>World history is the record of the spirit's efforts to attain knowledge of what it is in itself. The Orientals do not know that the spirit or man as such are free in themselves. And because they do not know that, they are not themselves free. They only know that '''One''' is free.... The consciousness of freedom first awoke among the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], and they were accordingly free; but, like the Romans, they only knew that '''Some''', and not all men as such, are free.... The [[Germans#Middle Ages|Germanic nations]], with the rise of [[Christianity]], were the first to realize that '''All''' men are by nature free, and that freedom of spirit is his very essence.<ref>''Lectures'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=pjfaimuprzoC&pg=PA54&hl=en&dq=%22World+history+is+the+record+of+the+spirit's+efforts+to+attain+knowledge+of+what+it+is+in+itself.+The+Orientals+do+not+know+that+the+spirit+or+man+as+such+are+free+in+themselves.+And+because+they+do+not+know+that,+they+are+not+themselves+free.+They+only+know+that+One+is+free.%22%22The+consciousness+of+freedom+first+awoke+among+the+Greeks,+and+they+were+accordingly+free;+but,+like+the+Romans,+they+only+knew+that+Some,+and+not+all+men+as+such,+are+free%22%22The+Germanic+nations,+with+the+rise+of+Christianity,+were+the+first+to+realize+that+All+men+are+by+nature+free,+and+that+freedom+of+spirit+is+his+very+essence.%22 p. 54].</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n[[Karl Marx]] introduced the concept of [[historical materialism]] into the study of world historical development. In his conception, the economic conditions and dominant modes of production determined the structure of society at that point. In his view five successive stages in the development of material conditions would occur in [[Western Europe]]. The first stage was [[primitive communism]] where property was shared and there was no concept of \"leadership\". This progressed to a [[Slavery|slave society]] where the idea of [[Social class|class]] emerged and the [[State (polity)|State]] developed. [[Feudalism]] was characterized by an [[aristocracy]] working in partnership with a [[theocracy]] and the emergence of the [[Nation-state]]. [[Capitalism]] appeared after the bourgeois revolution when the capitalists (or their merchant predecessors) overthrew the feudal system and established a [[market economy]], with\n[[private property]] and [[Parliamentary democracy]]. Marx then predicted the eventual proletarian revolution that would result in the attainment of [[socialism]], followed by [[Communism]], where property would be communally owned.\n\nPrevious historians had focused on cyclical events of the rise and decline of rulers and nations. Process of [[nationalization of history]], as part of [[Romantic nationalism|national revivals]] in the 19th century, resulted with separation of \"one's own\" history from common [[universal history]] by such way of perceiving, understanding and treating the past that constructed history as history of a nation.<ref name = \"laboratory\">{{Cite book\n| url         = https://books.google.com/?id=f52rawP96lYC&pg=PA39&lpg=PA39&dq=%22nationalisation+of+history%22#v=onepage&q=%22nationalisation%20of%20history%22&f=false\n| title       = A Laboratory of Transnational History Ukraine and recent Ukrainian historiography\n| accessdate  = October 18, 2010\n| author      = Georgiy Kasianov, Philipp Terr\n| pages       = 7\n| quote       = This essay deals with, what I call, \"nationalized history\", meaning a way of perceiving, understanding and treating the past that requires separation of \"one's own\" history from \"common\" history and its construction as history of a nation.\n| isbn       = 978-1-84545-621-4\n| date         = 2010-04-07}}</ref> A new discipline, [[sociology]], emerged in the late 19th century and analyzed and compared these perspectives on a larger scale.\n\n===Macaulay and Whig history===\n[[File:Thomas Babington Macaulay, Baron Macaulay.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Macaulay]] was the most influential exponent of the [[Whig history]]]]\n\nThe term [[Whig history]], coined by [[Herbert Butterfield]] in his short book ''The Whig Interpretation of History'' in 1931, means the approach to historiography which presents the past as an inevitable progression towards ever greater liberty and enlightenment, culminating in modern forms of [[liberal democracy]] and [[constitutional monarchy]]. In general, Whig historians emphasized the rise of [[constitutional government]], [[personal freedom]]s and [[scientific progress]]. The term has been also applied widely in historical disciplines outside of [[British history]] (the [[history of science]], for example) to criticize any [[Teleology|teleological]] (or goal-directed), hero-based, and [[Transhistoricity|transhistorical]] narrative.<ref>Ernst Mayr, \"When Is Historiography Whiggish?\" ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', April 1990, Vol. 51 Issue 2, pp 301\u201309 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2709517 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\n[[Paul de Rapin|Paul Rapin de Thoyras]]'s history of England, published in 1723, became \"the classic Whig history\" for the first half of the 18th century,.<ref>Hugh Trevor-Roper, 'Introduction', ''Lord Macaulay's History of England'' (Penguin Classics, 1979), p. 10.</ref> It was later supplanted by the immensely popular ''[[The History of England (Hume)|The History of England]]'' by [[David Hume]].

This model of human progress has been called the [[Whig history|Whig interpretation of history]].<ref>John Clive, ''Macaulay \u2013 the shaping of the historian'' (1975)</ref> He published the first volumes of his most famous work of history, ''[[The History of England from the Accession of James II]]'', in 1848.

The school emphasized the use of quantification and the paying of special attention to geography.<ref>See Lucien Febvre, ''La Terre et l'\u00e9volution humaine'' (1922), translated as ''A Geographical Introduction to History'' (London, 1932).</ref><ref>See [http://www.editions.ehess.fr/revues/annales-histoire-sciences-sociales/numeros-parus/ for recent issues]</ref>\n\nThe ''Annales d'histoire \u00e9conomique et sociale'' journal was founded in 1929 in [[Strasbourg]] by [[Marc Bloch]] and [[Lucien Febvre]]. These authors, the former a medieval historian and the latter an early modernist, quickly became associated with the distinctive ''Annales'' approach, which combined geography, history, and the sociological approaches of the [[Ann\u00e9e Sociologique]] (many members of which were their colleagues at Strasbourg) to produce an approach which rejected the predominant emphasis on politics, diplomacy and war of many 19th and early 20th-century historians as spearheaded by historians whom Febvre called Les Sorbonnistes. Instead, they pioneered an approach to a study of long-term historical structures (''la [[longue dur\u00e9e]]'') over events and political transformations.<ref>Colin Jones, \"Olwen Hufton's 'Poor', Richard Cobb's 'People', and the Notions of the longue dur\u00e9e in French Revolutionary Historiography\", ''Past & Present'', 2006 Supplement (Volume 1), pp. 178\u2013203 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/past_and_present/v2006/2006.1Sjones.html in Project Muse]</ref>  Geography, material culture, and what later Annalistes called ''mentalit\u00e9s'', or the psychology of the epoch, are also characteristic areas of study. The goal of the ''Annales'' was to undo the work of the ''Sorbonnistes'', to turn French historians away from the narrowly political and diplomatic toward the new vistas in social and economic history.<ref>J.H.

Braudel developed the idea, often associated with Annalistes, of different modes of historical time: ''l'histoire quasi immobile'' (motionless history) of historical geography, the history of social, political and economic structures (''la [[longue dur\u00e9e]]''), and the history of men and events, in the context of their structures. His 'longue dur\u00e9e' approach stressed slow, and often imperceptible effects of space, climate and technology on the actions of human beings in the past.  The ''Annales'' historians, after living through two world wars and major political upheavals in France, were deeply uncomfortable with the notion that multiple ruptures and discontinuities created history. They preferred to stress slow change and the longue dur\u00e9e. They paid special attention to geography, climate, and demography as long-term factors. They considered the continuities of the deepest structures were central to history, beside which upheavals in institutions or the superstructure of social life were of little significance, for history lies beyond the reach of conscious actors, especially the will of revolutionaries.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Olivia |last=Harris |title=Braudel: Historical Time and the Horror of Discontinuity |journal=[[History Workshop Journal]] |year=2004 |volume=57 |pages=161\u2013174 |issn=1363-3554 |url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/849/ |doi=10.1093/hwj/57.1.161 |citeseerx=10.1.1.693.9898 }} Only Ari\u00e8s was a true conservative\u2014indeed a royalist.</ref>\n\nNoting the political upheavals in Europe and especially in France in 1968, [[Eric Hobsbawm]] argued that \"in France the virtual hegemony of Braudelian history and the ''Annales'' came to an end after 1968, and the international influence of the journal dropped steeply.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Eric J.

Scholars moved in multiple directions, covering in disconnected fashion the social, economic, and cultural history of different eras and different parts of the globe. By the time of crisis the school was building a vast publishing and research network reaching across France, Europe, and the rest of the world. Influence indeed spread out from Paris, but few new ideas came in. Much emphasis was given to quantitative data, seen as the key to unlocking all of social history.<ref>One of numerous spin-off journals was ''Histoire & mesure'' (1986\u2014), devoted to quantitative history.</ref>  However, the ''Annales'' ignored the developments in quantitative studies underway in the U.S. and Britain, which reshaped economic, political and demographic research.<ref>Georg G.

[[Friedrich Engels]] wrote ''[[The Peasant War in Germany]]'', which analysed social warfare in early Protestant Germany in terms of emerging capitalist classes. Although it lacked a rigorous engagement with archival sources, it indicated an early interest in [[People's history|history from below]] and class analysis, and it attempts a dialectical analysis. Another treatise of Engels, ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'', was salient in creating the [[socialist]] impetus in British politics from then on, e.g. the [[Fabian Society]].\n\n[[R. H. Tawney]] was an early historian working in this tradition. ''The Agrarian Problem in the Sixteenth Century'' (1912)<ref>[[William Rose Ben\u00e9t]] (1988) p.&nbsp;961</ref> and ''Religion and the Rise of Capitalism'' (1926), reflected his ethical concerns and preoccupations in economic history. He was profoundly interested in the issue of the enclosure of land in the English countryside in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and in [[Max Weber]]'s thesis on the connection between the appearance of [[Protestantism]] and the rise of capitalism. His belief in the rise of the gentry in the century before the outbreak of the Civil War in England provoked the 'Storm over the Gentry' in which his methods were subjected to severe criticisms by [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]] and John Cooper.\n\n[[Historiography in the Soviet Union]] was greatly influenced by Marxist historiography, as [[historical materialism]] was extended into the Soviet version of [[dialectical materialism]].\n\nA circle of historians inside the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB) formed in 1946 and became a highly influential cluster of [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Marxist historiography|Marxist historians]], who contributed to [[history from below]] and class structure in early capitalist society. While some members of the group (most notably [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]] and [[E. P. Thompson]]) left the CPGB after the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]], the common points of British Marxist historiography continued in their works. They placed a great emphasis on the subjective determination of history.\n\nChristopher Hill's studies on 17th-century English history were widely acknowledged and recognised as representative of this school.<ref name=\"Oxford DNB\">{{cite ODNB|title=Hill, (John Edward) Christopher (1912\u20132003)|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/89437|accessdate=29 June 2012|date=January 2007|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/89437}}</ref> His books include ''Puritanism and Revolution'' (1958), ''Intellectual Origins of the English Revolution'' (1965 and revised in 1996), ''The Century of Revolution'' (1961), ''AntiChrist in 17th-century England'' (1971), ''The World Turned Upside Down'' (1972) and many others.\n\n[[E. P. Thompson]] pioneered the study of history from below in his work, ''[[The Making of the English Working Class]]'', published in 1963. It focused on the forgotten history of the first working-class political left in the world in the late-18th and early-19th centuries. In his preface to this book, Thompson set out his approach to writing history from below:\n\n{{quote|text=I am seeking to rescue the poor stockinger, the [[Luddite]] cropper, the \"obsolete\" hand-loom weaver, the \"Utopian\" artisan, and even the deluded follower of [[Joanna Southcott]], from the enormous condescension of posterity. Their crafts and traditions may have been dying. Their hostility to the new industrialism may have been backward-looking. Their communitarian ideals may have been fantasies. Their insurrectionary conspiracies may have been foolhardy. But they lived through these times of acute social disturbance, and we did not. Their aspirations were valid in terms of their own experience; and, if they were casualties of history, they remain, condemned in their own lives, as casualties.}}\n\nThompson's work was also significant because of the way he defined \"class\". He argued that class was not a structure, but a relationship that changed over time. He opened the gates for a generation of labor historians, such as [[David Montgomery (historian)|David Montgomery]] and [[Herbert Gutman]], who made similar studies of the American working classes.\n\nOther important Marxist historians included [[Eric Hobsbawm]], [[C. L. R. James]], [[Raphael Samuel]], [[A. L. Morton]] and [[Brian Pearce]].\n\nAlthough Marxist historiography made important contributions to the history of the [[working class]], oppressed nationalities, and the [[methodology]] of [[People's history|history from below]], its chief problematic aspect was its argument on the nature of history as ''determined'' or ''dialectical''; this can also be stated as the relative importance of subjective and objective factors in creating outcomes. It increasingly fell out of favour in the 1960s and '70s. [[Geoffrey Elton]] was important in undermining the case for a [[Marxist historiography]], which he argued was presenting seriously flawed interpretations of the past. In particular, Elton was opposed to the idea that the [[English Civil War]] was caused by socioeconomic changes in the 16th and 17th centuries, arguing instead that it was due largely to the incompetence of the [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] kings.<ref>See his essays 'The Stuart Century', 'A High Road to Civil War?' and 'The Unexplained Revolution' in G. R. Elton, ''Studies in Tudor and Stuart Politics and Government: Volume II'' (Cambridge University Press, 1974).</ref>\n\nIn dealing with the era of the [[Second World War]], Addison notes that in Britain by the 1990s, labour history was, \"in sharp decline\", because:\n{{quote|there was no longer much interest in history of the white, male working-class.  Instead the 'cultural turn' encouraged historians to explore wartime constructions of gender, race, citizenship and national identity.<ref>Paul Addison and Harriet Jones, eds. ''A Companion to Contemporary Britain: 1939\u20132000'' (2005) p 4</ref>}}\n\n===Biography===\n{{Further|Biography}}\nBiography has been a major form of historiography since the days when [[Plutarch]] wrote the parallel lives of great Roman and Greek leaders. It is a field especially attractive to nonacademic historians, and often to the spouses or children of famous people, who have access to the trove of letters and documents. Academic historians tend to downplay biography because it pays too little attention to broad social, cultural, political and economic forces, and perhaps too much attention to popular psychology. The \"[[Great man theory|Great Man]]\" tradition in Britain originated in the multi-volume ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' (which originated in 1882 and issued updates into the 1970s); it continues to this day in the new ''[[Dictionary of National Biography|Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'.' In the United States, the ''[[Dictionary of American Biography]]'' was planned in the late 1920s and appeared with numerous supplements into the 1980s.  It has now been displaced by the ''[[American National Biography]]'' as well as numerous smaller historical encyclopedias that give thorough coverage to Great Persons. Bookstores do a thriving business in biographies, which sell far more copies than the esoteric monographs based on post-structuralism, cultural, racial or gender history. [[Michael Holroyd]] says the last forty years \"may be seen as a golden age of biography\", but nevertheless calls it the \"shallow end of history\". Nicolas Barker argues that \"more and more biographies command an ever larger readership\", as he speculates that biography has come \"to express the spirit of our age\".<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Riall | first1 = Lucy | year = 2010 | title = The Shallow End of History?

G. Collingwood]]'s idealism, and rejected the empirical view of the historian's work being an accretion of \"facts\" that they have at their disposal as nonsense.  He maintained that there is such a vast quantity of information that the historian always chooses the \"facts\" they decide to make use of. In Carr's famous example, he claimed that millions had crossed the Rubicon, but only Julius Caesar's crossing in 49 BC is declared noteworthy by historians.<ref name=\"Huges-Warrington, Marnie p. 26\">Huges-Warrington, p. 26</ref><ref>Carr, ''What Is History?'', p. 10;</ref> For this reason, Carr argued that [[Leopold von Ranke]]'s famous dictum ''wie es eigentlich gewesen'' (show what actually happened) was wrong because it presumed that the \"facts\" influenced what the historian wrote, rather than the historian choosing what \"facts of the past\" they intended to turn into \"historical facts\".<ref>Carr, ''What Is History?'', pp. 8\u201313</ref> At the same time, Carr argued that the study of the facts may lead the historian to change his or her views.  In this way, Carr argued that history was \"an unending dialogue between the past and present\".<ref name=\"Huges-Warrington, Marnie p. 26\"/><ref>Carr, ''What Is History?'', p. 30</ref>\n\nCarr is held by some critics to have had a deterministic outlook in history.<ref name=\"Huges-Warrington, Marnie p. 27\">Huges-Warrington, p. 27. One of his first and most influential critics was the British philosopher, Michael Oakeshott, 'What is History?' (1961), in idem, ''What is History and Other Essays'' (Exeter, 2004), 325.</ref> Others have modified or rejected this use of the label \"determinist\".<ref>See M. Hewitson, ''History and Causality'' (Basingstoke, 2014), pp. 86\u201393.</ref> He took a hostile view of those historians who stress the workings of chance and contingency in the workings of history. In Carr's view, no individual is truly free of the social environment in which they live, but contended that within those limitations, there was room, albeit very narrow room for people to make decisions that affect history.  Carr emphatically contended that history was a [[Social sciences|social science]], not an [[The arts|art]],<ref name=HW28>Huges-Warrington, p. 28</ref> because historians like scientists seek generalizations that helped to broaden the understanding of one's subject.<ref name=HW28/><ref>Carr, ''What Is History?'', p. 62</ref>\n\nOne of Carr's most forthright critics was [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]], who argued that Carr's dismissal of the \"might-have-beens of history\" reflected a fundamental lack of interest in examining historical causation.<ref>Trevor-Roper, pp. 72\u201373</ref> Trevor-Roper asserted that examining possible alternative outcomes of history was far from being a \"parlour-game\" was rather an essential part of the historians' work,<ref name=\"Trevor-Roper p. 73\">Trevor-Roper, p. 73</ref> as only by considering all possible outcomes of a given situation could a historian properly understand the period.\n\nThe controversy inspired Sir [[Geoffrey Elton]] to write his 1967 book ''The Practice of History''. Elton criticized Carr for his \"whimsical\" distinction between the \"historical facts\" and the \"facts of the past\", arguing that it reflected \"...an extraordinarily arrogant attitude both to the past and to the place of the historian studying it\".<ref>Elton, Geoffrey ''The Practice of History'', London: Methuen, 1967 pp. 56\u201357</ref> Elton, instead, strongly defended the traditional methods of history and was also appalled by the inroads made by [[postmodernism]].<ref>\u00d3 Tuathaigh, M. A. G., \u2018Irish Historical \", Revisionism\": State of the Art of Ideological Project?\u2019 in, Brady, Ciaran (ed.), Interpreting Irish History (Dublin, 2006), p. 325.</ref> Elton saw the duty of historians as empirically gathering evidence and objectively analyzing what the evidence has to say. As a traditionalist, he placed great emphasis on the role of individuals in history instead of abstract, impersonal forces. Elton saw political history as the highest kind of history. Elton had no use for those who seek history to make myths, to create laws to explain the past, or to produce theories such as [[Marxism]].\n\n===U.S. approaches===\n{{main|Historiography of the United States}}\nClassical and European history was part of the 19th-century grammar curriculum.

The goal was to incorporate in historical studies perspectives from all the social sciences, especially political science, sociology and economics. The pioneers shared a commitment to quantification. However, by the 1980s the first blush of quantification had worn off, as traditional historians counterattacked. [[Harvey J. Graff]] says:\n{{quote|The case against the new mixed and confused a lengthy list of ingredients, including the following: history\u2019s supposed loss of identity and humanity in the stain of social science, the fear of subordinating quality to quantity, conceptual and technical fallacies, violation of the literary character and biographical base of \", good\" history (rhetorical and aesthetic concern), loss of audiences, derogation of history rooted in \", great men\" and \", great events\", trivialization in general, a hodge-podge of ideological objections from all directions, and a fear that new historians were reaping research funds that might otherwise come to their detractors.

Another standard division within the historiography is the temporal factor, with works falling into either the early modern period (or \u201ccolonial era\u201d) or the post-independence (or \u201cnational\u201d) period, from the early nineteenth onward. Relatively few works span the two eras and few works except textbooks unite Spanish America and Brazil. There is a tendency to focus on histories of particular countries or regions (the Andes, the Southern Cone, the Caribbean) with relatively little comparative work.\n\nHistorians of Latin America have contributed to various types of historical writing, but one major, innovative development in Spanish American history is the emergence of [[ethnohistory]], the history of indigenous peoples, especially in Mexico based on alphabetic sources in Spanish or in [[New Philology|indigenous languages]].<ref>Howard F.

It focused on the examination of history from a global perspective and looked for common patterns that emerged across all cultures. The basic thematic approach of this field was to analyse two major focal points: [[syncretism|integration]]&nbsp;\u2013 (how processes of world history have drawn people of the world together), and difference&nbsp;\u2013 (how patterns of world history reveal the diversity of the human experience).\n\n[[Arnold J. Toynbee]]'s ten-volume ''[[A Study of History]]'', took an approach that was widely discussed in the 1930s and 1940s. By the 1960s his work was virtually ignored by scholars and the general public.  He compared 26 independent civilizations and argued that they displayed striking parallels in their origin, growth, and decay.  He proposed a universal model to each of these civilizations, detailing the stages through which they all pass: genesis, growth, time of troubles, universal state, and disintegration. The later volumes gave too much emphasis on spirituality to satisfy critics.<ref>William H. McNeill, ''Arnold J. Toynbee a Life'' (1989)</ref>\n\nChicago historian [[William Hardy McNeill|William H. McNeill]] wrote ''[[The Rise of the West]]'' (1965) to show how the separate civilizations of Eurasia interacted from the very beginning of their history, borrowing critical skills from one another, and thus precipitating still further change as adjustment between traditional old and borrowed new knowledge and practice became necessary. He then discusses the dramatic effect of [[Western culture|Western civilization]] on others in the past 500 years of history. McNeill took a broad approach organized around the interactions of peoples across the globe. Such interactions have become both more numerous and more continual and substantial in recent times. Before about 1500, the network of communication between cultures was that of Eurasia. The term for these areas of interaction differ from one world historian to another and include ''world-system'' and ''ecumene.'' His emphasis on cultural fusions influenced historical theory significantly.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = McNeill | first1 = William H. | year = 1995 | title = The Changing Shape of World History | url = | journal = History and Theory | volume = 34 | issue = 2| pages = 8\u201326 | doi = 10.2307/2505432 | jstor = 2505432 }}</ref>\n\n===The cultural turn===\nThe \"cultural turn\" of the 1980s and 1990s affected scholars in most areas of history.<ref>It missed some areas. {{cite journal | last1 = Martin | first1 = Kevin W. | year = 2014 | title = Middle East Historiography: Did We Miss the Cultural Turn? | url = | journal = History Compass | volume = 12 | issue = 2| pages = 178\u2013186 | doi = 10.1111/hic3.12142 }}</ref>  Inspired largely by anthropology, it turned away from leaders, ordinary people and famous events to look at the use of language and cultural symbols to represent the changing values of society.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Grigor Suny | first1 = Ronald | year = 2002 | title = Back and Beyond: Reversing the Cultural Turn? | journal = American Historical Review | volume = 107 | issue = 5| pages = 1476\u20131499 | doi = 10.1086/532855 | jstor = 10.1086/532855 }}</ref>\n\nThe British historian [[Peter Burke (historian)|Peter Burke]] finds that cultural studies has numerous spinoffs, or topical themes it has strongly influenced.

The early journals were similar to those for the physical sciences, and were seen as a means for history to become more professional. Journals also helped historians to establish various historiographical approaches, the most notable example of which was ''[[Annales. \u00c9conomies, soci\u00e9t\u00e9s, civilisations]]'', a publication of the [[Annales school|''Annales'' school]] in France.  Journals now typically have one or more editors and associate editors, an editorial board, and a pool of scholars to whom articles that are submitted are sent for confidential evaluation.  The editors will send out new books to recognized scholars for reviews that usually run 500 to 1000 words. The vetting and publication process often takes months or longer. Publication in a prestigious journal (which accept 10% or fewer of the articles submitted) is an asset in the academic hiring and promotion process. Publication demonstrates that the author is conversant with the scholarly field.  Page charges and fees for publication are uncommon in history. Journals are subsidized by universities or historical societies, scholarly associations, and subscription fees from libraries and scholars. Increasingly they are available through library pools that allow many academic institutions to pool subscriptions to online versions.

In 1979, at a time when the new [[Social History]] was demanding a social-science model of analysis, Stone detected a move back toward the narrative. Stone defined narrative as follows: it is organized [[chronological]]ly; it is focused on a single coherent story; it is descriptive rather than analytical; it is concerned with people not abstract circumstances; and it deals with the particular and specific rather than the collective and statistical. He reported that, \"More and more of the 'new historians' are now trying to discover what was going on inside people's heads in the past, and what it was like to live in the past, questions which inevitably lead back to the use of narrative.\"<ref>Lawrence Stone, \"The Revival of Narrative: Reflections on a New Old History\", ''Past and Present'' 85 (Nov 1979) pp. 3\u201324, quote on p. 13</ref>\n\nHistorians committed to a social science approach, however, have criticized the narrowness of narrative and its preference for anecdote over analysis, and its use of clever examples rather than statistically verified empirical regularities.<ref>J.

Monkkonen, \"The Dangers of Synthesis\", ''American Historical Review'' 91, no. 5 (December 1986): 1146\u201357.</ref>\n\n==Topics studied==\nSome of the common topics in historiography are:\n# Reliability of the sources used, in terms of authorship, credibility of the author, and the authenticity or corruption of the text.  (See also [[source criticism]]).\n# Historiographical tradition or framework. Every historian uses one (or more) historiographical traditions, for example [[Marxist]], [[Annales school|''Annales'' school]], \"total history\", or [[political history]].\n# [[morality|Moral]] issues, guilt assignment, and praise assignment\n# [[historical revisionism|Revisionism]] versus [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] interpretations\n# Historical [[metanarratives]] and metahistory.<ref>Nikola\u012d Onufrievich Losski\u012d -History of Russian Philosophy 1951 \u2013 - Page 245 \"It must not be imagined, however, that history and metahistory are entirely separate: \"Metahistory is continually present as the background of history.

But it implies going beyond, a transcendence of history and in this sense it is equated with metaphysics and theology. Sometimes historical time is distinguished from metahistorical eternity.\"</ref>\n\n==Approaches==\nHow a historian approaches historical events is one of the most important decisions within historiography. It is commonly recognised by historians that, in themselves, individual historical facts dealing with names, dates and places are not particularly meaningful. Such facts will only become useful when assembled with other historical evidence, and the process of assembling this evidence is understood as a particular historiographical approach.\n\nThe most influential historiographical approaches are:\n\n* [[Business history]]\n* [[Comparative history]]\n* [[Cultural history]]\n* [[Diplomatic history]]\n* [[Economic history]]\n* [[Environmental history]], a relatively new field\n* [[Ethnohistory]]\n* [[Gender history]] including [[Woman's history]], [[Family history]], [[Feminist history]]\n* [[History of medicine|History of Medicine]]\n* [[History of Religion]] and [[Church history|Church History]]; the history of theology is usually handled under [[Theology]]\n* [[Intellectual History]] and [[History of ideas]]\n* [[Labor history (discipline)|Labor history]]\n* [[Local History]] and [[Microhistory]]\n* [[Marxist historiography]] and [[Historical materialism]]\n* [[Military history]], including naval and air\n* [[Oral history]]\n* [[Political history]]\n* [[Public history]], especially museums and historic preservation\n* [[Quantitative history]], [[Cliometrics]] (in economic history); [[Prosopography]] using statistics to study biographies\n* [[History of religions]]\n* [[Historiography of science]] \n* [[Social history]] and [[People's history|History from below]]; along with the French version the [[Annales school|''Annales'' school]] and the German [[Bielefeld School]]\n* [[Subaltern Studies]], Regarding post-colonial India\n* [[Urban history]]\n** [[American urban history]]\n* [[Whig history]], History as the story of continuous progress\n* [[World history]]\n\n===Related fields===\nImportant related fields include:\n* [[Antiquarian]]ism\n* [[Genealogy]]\n* [[Numismatics]]\n* [[Intellectual history]]\n* [[Paleography]]\n* [[Philosophy of history]]\n* [[Pseudohistory]]\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[List of historians by area of study]]\n* [[Historical significance]]\n* [[National memory]]\n\n===Methods===\n* [[Archival research]]\n* [[Auxiliary sciences of history]]\n* [[Historical method]]\n* [[List of historians]], inclusive of most major historians\n** [[List of historians by area of study]]\n* [[List of history journals]]\n* [[Philosophy of history]]\n* [[Popular history]]\n** [[Primary source]]&nbsp;\u2013 documents, correspondence, diaries\n*** [[Secondary source]]&nbsp;\u2013 interpretations, written history\n**** [[Tertiary source]]&nbsp;\u2013 textbooks and encyclopedias\n* [[Public history]], including museums and historical preservation\n* [[Historical revisionism]]\n* [[Shared historical authority]]\n* [[v:Topic:Historiography|Historiography at Wikiversity]], where it is part of the [[v:School:History|School of History]]\n\n===Topics===\n* [[Historiography of Argentina]]\n* [[Atlantic history]]\n* [[Historiography of Canada]]\n* [[Chinese historiography]]\n* [[Classics]]\n** [[Greek historiography]] \n*** [[Historiography of Alexander the Great]]\n** [[Roman historiography]] \n*** [[Historiography of the fall of the Western Roman Empire]]\n* [[Historiography of the Cold War]]\n* [[Historiography of the French Revolution]]\n** [[Annales school|''Annales'' school]], in France\n* [[Historiography of Germany]] \n** [[Bielefeld School]], in Germany\n* [[History of India#Historiography]]\n** [[Historiography of the fall of the Mughal Empire]]\n* [[Historiography of early Islam]]\n* [[Historiography of Japan]]\n* [[Historiography of Korea]]\n** [[Korean nationalist historiography]]\n* [[History of Latin America|Latin American History]]\n* [[Middle Ages]]\n** [[Historiography of early Christianity]]\n** [[Historiography of feudalism#Historiography|Historiography of feudalism]]\n** [[Dark Ages (historiography)]]\n** [[Historiography of the Crusades]]\n* [[Historiography and nationalism]]\n* [[Historiography of Switzerland]]\n* [[Historiography in the Soviet Union]]\n* [[Historiography of the United States]]\n** [[Frontier Thesis]]\n* [[Historiography of the United Kingdom]]\n** [[Historiography of Scotland]]\n** [[Historiography of the British Empire]]\n* [[World history]]\n* [[Historiography of the causes of World War I]]\n* [[Historiography of World War II]]\n** [[Historiography of the Battle of France]], 1940\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Theory===\n* Appleby, Joyce, Lynn Hunt & Margaret Jacob, ''Telling the Truth About History''.

The historiography of a specific topic covers how historians have studied that topic using particular sources, techniques, and theoretical approaches. Scholars discuss historiography by topic\u2014such as the [[historiography of the United Kingdom]], [[historiography of World War II|that of WWII]], [[historiography of the British Empire|the British Empire]], [[historiography of early Islam|early Islam]], and [[Chinese historiography|China]]\u2014and different approaches and genres, such as [[political history]] and [[social history]]. Beginning in the nineteenth century, with the development of [[academic history]], there developed a body of historiographic literature. The extent to which historians are influenced by their own groups and loyalties\u2014such as [[Nationalist historiography|to their nation state]]\u2014remains a debated question.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ferro, Marc|title=The Use and Abuse of History: Or How the Past Is Taught to Children|date=2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author1=Candelaria, John Lee |author2=Alporha, Veronica |year=2018 |title=Readings in Philippine History }}</ref>\n\nIn the [[ancient world]], chronological [[annal]]s were produced in civilizations such as [[ancient Egypt]] and [[Ancient Near East|Mesopotamia]]. However, the discipline of historiography was first established in the 5th century BC with the ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' of [[Herodotus]], the founder of [[Greek historiography]]. The [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] statesman [[Cato the Elder]] produced the first [[Roman historiography|history in Latin]], the ''[[Origines]]'', in the 2nd century BC. His near contemporaries [[Sima Tan]] and [[Sima Qian]] in the [[Han Empire]] of [[Ancient China|China]] established [[Chinese historiography]] with the compiling of the ''[[Shiji]]'' (''Records of the Grand Historian''). During the [[Middle Ages]], [[medieval historiography]] included the works of [[chronicle]]s in [[Medieval literature|medieval Europe]], [[Islamic literature|Islamic histories]] by [[Muslim historians]], and the [[Korean historiography|Korean]] and [[Japanese historiography|Japanese]] historical writings based on the existing Chinese model. During the 18th century [[Age of Enlightenment]], historiography in the Western world was shaped and developed by figures such as [[Voltaire]], [[David Hume]], and [[Edward Gibbon]], who among others set the foundations for the modern discipline.\n\nThe research interests of historians change over time, and there has been a shift away from traditional diplomatic, economic, and political history toward newer approaches, especially social and [[Postcolonialism|cultural studies]]. From 1975 to 1995 the proportion of professors of history in American universities identifying with social history increased from 31 to 41 percent, while the proportion of political historians decreased from 40 to 30 percent.<ref>Diplomatic dropped from 5% to 3%, economic history from 7% to 5%, and cultural history grew from 14% to 16%. Based on the number of full-time professors in U.S. history departments. [[Stephen H. Haber]], David M. Kennedy, and Stephen D. Krasner, \"Brothers under the Skin: Diplomatic History and International Relations\", ''International Security'', Vol. 22, No. 1 (Summer, 1997), pp. 34\u201343 at p. 42 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2539326 online at JSTOR]</ref> In 2007, of 5,723 faculty in the departments of history at British universities, 1,644 (29%) identified themselves with social history and 1,425 (25%) identified themselves with political history.<ref>\nSee [http://www.history.ac.uk/ihr/Resources/Teachers/a27.html \"Teachers of History in the Universities of the UK 2007&nbsp;\u2013 listed by research interest\"] {{webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060530073940/http://www.history.ac.uk/ihr/Resources/Teachers/a27.html |date= 2006-05-30 }}\n</ref>  Since the 1980s there has been a special interest in the memories and commemoration of past events\u2014the histories as remembered and presented for popular celebration.<ref>David Glassberg, \"Public history and the study of memory.\" ''The Public Historian'' 18.2 (1996): 7-23 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3377910 online].</ref>\n\n==Terminology==\nIn the [[early modern period]], the term ''historiography'' meant \"the writing of history\", and ''historiographer'' meant \"[[historian]]\". In that sense certain [[Official history|official historians]] were given the title \"[[Historiographer Royal]]\" in [[Rikshistoriograf|Sweden]] (from 1618), [[Historiographer Royal (England)|England]] (from 1660), and [[Historiographer Royal (Scotland)|Scotland]] (from 1681). The Scottish post is still in existence.\n\nHistoriography was more recently defined as \"the study of the way history has been and is written&nbsp;\u2013 the history of historical writing\", which means that, \"When you study 'historiography' you do not study the events of the past directly, but the changing interpretations of those events in the works of individual historians.\"<ref>{{cite book |first1=Conal |last1=Furay |first2= Michael J. |last2=Salevouris |title=The Methods and Skills of History: A Practical Guide |publisher=[[Harlan Davidson (publisher)|Harlan Davidson]]<!-- This was a family-owned higher educational publishing house that was started in 1976 by someone with the surname Davidson and was sold to John Wiley & Sons in 2012, according to an Article in Publisher's Weekly. -->  |year=1988 |page=223 |isbn=0-88295-982-4}})</ref>\n\n==Antiquity==\n{{see|Ancient history}}\nUnderstanding the past appears to be a universal human need, and the \"telling of history\" has emerged independently in civilizations around the world. \nWhat constitutes history is a philosophical question (see [[philosophy of history]]).\n\nThe earliest [[Chronology|chronologies]] date back to [[Mesopotamia]] and [[ancient Egypt]], in the form of [[chronicle]]s and [[annal]]s. However, no historical writers in these early civilizations were known by name. By contrast, the term \"historiography\" is taken to refer to written history recorded in a narrative format for the purpose of informing future generations about events. In this limited sense, \"ancient history\" begins with the early historiography of [[Classical Antiquity]], in about the 5th century BCE.\n\n===Europe===\n====Greece====\n{{main|Greek historiography}}\n{{further|Ancient Greek literature}}\n[[File:Thucydides Manuscript.jpg|thumb|upright|Reproduction of part of a tenth-century copy of [[Thucydides]]'s ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]''.]]\n\nThe earliest known systematic historical thought emerged in [[ancient Greece]], a development which would be an important influence on the writing of history elsewhere around [[History of the Mediterranean region|the Mediterranean]] region. Greek historians greatly contributed to the development of historical methodology. The earliest known critical historical works were ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'', composed by [[Herodotus|Herodotus of Halicarnassus]] (484\u2013425 BCE) who became known as the \"father of history\".<ref>John L. Myres, ''Herodotus, Father of History'' (1953).</ref> Herodotus attempted to distinguish between more and less reliable accounts, and personally conducted research by travelling extensively, giving written accounts of various Mediterranean cultures. Although Herodotus' overall emphasis lay on the actions and characters of men, he also attributed an important role to divinity in the determination of historical events.\n\n[[File:Thucydides-bust-cutout ROM.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|Bust of Thucydides, Hellenistic copy of a 4th-century BC work]]\n\nThe generation following Herodotus witnessed a spate of local histories of the individual [[city-state]]s (''[[polis|poleis]]''), written by the first of the [[Local history|local historians]] who employed the written archives of city and sanctuary. [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] characterized these historians as the forerunners of Thucydides,<ref>Dionysius, ''On Thucydides'', 5.</ref> and these local histories continued to be written into [[Late Antiquity]], as long as the city-states survived. Two early figures stand out: [[Hippias of Elis]], who produced the lists of winners in the Olympic Games that provided the basic chronological framework as long as the pagan classical tradition lasted, and [[Hellanicus of Lesbos]], who compiled more than two dozen histories from civic records, all of them now lost.\n\n[[Thucydides]] largely eliminated divine causality in his account of the war between Athens and Sparta, establishing a rationalistic element which set a precedent for subsequent Western historical writings. He was also the first to distinguish between cause and immediate origins of an event, while his successor [[Xenophon]] ({{c.|lk=no|431}}&nbsp;\u2013 {{annum|355|BCE}}) introduced autobiographical elements and character studies in his ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]''.\n\nThe proverbial [[Philippic]] attacks of the Athenian orator [[Demosthenes]] ({{annum|384\u2013322|BCE}}) on [[Philip&nbsp;II of Macedon]] marked the height of ancient political agitation. The now lost history of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander's]] campaigns by the [[diadoch]] [[Ptolemy&nbsp;I]] ({{annum|367\u2013283|BCE}}) may represent the first historical work composed by a ruler. [[Polybius]] ({{c.|lk=no|203}}&nbsp;\u2013 {{annum|120|BCE}}) wrote on the rise of Rome to world prominence, and attempted to harmonize the Greek and Roman points of view.\n\nThe [[Chaldea]]n priest [[Berossus]] ({{annum|{{floruit|3rd century}}|BCE}}) composed a Greek-language ''History of [[Babylonia]]'' for the [[Seleucid]] king [[Antiochus&nbsp;I]], combining [[Hellenistic]] methods of historiography and [[Mesopotamia]]n accounts to form a unique composite. Reports exist of other near-eastern histories, such as that of the Phoenician historian [[Sanchuniathon]]; but he is considered semi-legendary and writings attributed to him are fragmentary, known only through the later historians [[Philo of Byblos]] and [[Eusebius]], who asserted that he wrote before even the [[Trojan war]].\n\n====Rome====\n{{Main|Roman historiography}}\n{{further|Latin literature}}\n[[File:Marco Porcio Caton Major.jpg|thumb|upright|The Roman [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] of historian [[Cato the Elder]]]]\n\n[[Ancient Romans|The Romans]] adopted the Greek tradition, writing at first in Greek, but eventually chronicling their history in a freshly non-Greek language. While early [[Roman literature|Roman works]] were still written in Greek, the ''Origines'', composed by the Roman statesman [[Cato the Elder]] ({{annum|234\u2013149|BCE}}), was written in Latin, in a conscious effort to counteract Greek cultural influence. It marked the beginning of Latin historical writings. Hailed for its lucid style, [[Julius Caesar]]'s ({{annum|100\u201344|BCE}}) ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico|de Bello Gallico]]'' exemplifies autobiographical war coverage. The politician and orator [[Cicero]] ({{annum|106\u201343|BCE}}) introduced rhetorical elements in his political writings.\n\n[[Strabo]] ({{annum|63|BCE}}&nbsp;\u2013 {{annum|{{c.|lk=no|24}}|[[Common Era|CE]]}}) was an important exponent of the [[Greco-Roman]] tradition of combining geography with history, presenting a descriptive history of peoples and places known to his era. [[Livy]] ({{annum|59|BCE}}&nbsp;\u2013 {{annum|17|CE}}) records the rise of [[Roman Empire|Rome]] from [[city-state]] to [[empire]]. His speculation about what would have happened if [[Alexander the Great]] had marched against Rome represents the first known instance of [[alternate history]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/Livy/Livy09.html |title=Livy's History of Rome: Book 9 |publisher=Mcadams.posc.mu.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-08-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070228233052/http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/txt/ah/Livy/Livy09.html |archive-date=2007-02-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nBiography, although popular throughout antiquity, was introduced as a branch of history by the works of [[Plutarch]] ({{c.|lk=no|46}}&nbsp;\u2013 {{annum|127|CE}}) and [[Suetonius]] ({{c.|lk=no|69}}&nbsp;\u2013 after {{annum|130|CE}}) who described the deeds and characters of ancient personalities, stressing their human side. [[Tacitus]] ({{annum|{{c.|lk=no|56|117}}|CE}}) denounces Roman immorality by praising [[Germanic peoples|German]] virtues, elaborating on the [[topos]] of the [[Noble savage]].\n\n===East Asia===\n====China====\n{{Main|Chinese historiography|Twenty-Four Histories}}\n{{further|Chinese literature}}\n[[File:Shiji.jpg|upright|thumb|First page of the ''[[Shiji]]''.]]\n\nThe Han dynasty eunuch [[Sima Qian]] (around {{annum|100|BCE}}) was the first in China to lay the groundwork for professional historical writing. His work superseded the older style of the ''[[Spring and Autumn Annals]]'', compiled in the 5th century BC, the ''[[Bamboo Annals]]'' and other court and dynastic [[annals]] that recorded history in a [[chronological]] form that abstained from [[analysis]]. Sima's ''[[Shiji]]'' (''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'') pioneered the \"Annals-biography\" format, which would become the standard for prestige history writing in China. In this genre a history opens with a chronological outline of court affairs, and then continues with detailed biographies of prominent people who lived during the period in question.<ref>Thomas R. Martin, ''Herodotus and Sima Qian: The First Great Historians of Greece and China: A Brief History with Documents'' (2009).</ref> The scope of his work extended as far back as the {{annum|16th century|BCE}}, and included many treatises on specific subjects and individual biographies of prominent people. He also explored the lives and deeds of commoners, both contemporary and those of previous eras.\n\nWhereas Sima's had been a universal history from the beginning of time down to the time of writing, his successor [[Ban Gu]] wrote an annals-biography history limiting its coverage to only the [[Western Han dynasty]], the [[Book of Han]] (96 CE). This established the notion of using dynastic boundaries as start- and end-points, and most later Chinese histories would focus on a single dynasty or group of dynasties.\n\nThe Records of the Grand Historian and Book of Han were eventually joined by the [[Book of the Later Han]] (488 CE) (replacing the earlier, and now only partially extant, Han Records from the Eastern Pavilion) and the [[Records of the Three Kingdoms]] (297 CE) to form the \"Four Histories\". These became mandatory reading for the [[Imperial Examinations]] and have therefore exerted an influence on Chinese culture comparable to the [[Thirteen Classics|Confucian Classics]]. More annals-biography histories were written in subsequent dynasties, eventually bringing the number to between twenty-four and twenty-six, but none ever reached the popularity and impact of the first four.<ref>Wilkinson 2018, pp. 692-695</ref>\n\nTraditional Chinese historiography describes history in terms of [[dynastic cycle]]s.

The [[Early centers of Christianity|growth of Christianity]] and its enhanced status in the Roman Empire after [[Constantine I and Christianity|Constantine&nbsp;I]] (see [[State church of the Roman Empire]]) led to the development of a distinct Christian historiography, influenced by both [[Christian theology]] and the nature of the [[Christian Bible]], encompassing new areas of study and views of history.  The central role of the Bible in Christianity is reflected in the preference of Christian historians for written sources, compared to the classical historians' preference for oral sources and is also reflected in the inclusion of politically unimportant people. Christian historians also focused on development of religion and society.  This can be seen in the extensive inclusion of written sources in the ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Ecclesiastical History]]'' written by [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] around 324 and in the subjects it covers.<ref name=\"sxixkf\">[http://www.cuw.edu/Academics/programs/history/historiography.html ''Historiography''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018032745/http://www.cuw.edu/Academics/programs/history/historiography.html |date=2007-10-18 }}, Concordia University Wisconsin, retrieved on 2 November 2007</ref>  Christian theology considered time as linear, progressing according to divine plan.

Among the many Italians who contributed to this were [[Leonardo Bruni]] (c. 1370\u20131444), [[Francesco Guicciardini]] (1483\u20131540), and [[Caesar Baronius|Cesare Baronio]] (1538\u20131607).\n\n===Voltaire===\nFrench ''[[Philosophes|philosophe]]'' [[Voltaire]] (1694\u20131778) had an enormous influence on the development of historiography during the Age of Enlightenment through his demonstration of fresh new ways to look at the past. Guillaume de Syon argues:\n:Voltaire recast historiography in both factual and analytical terms. Not only did he reject traditional biographies and accounts that claim the work of supernatural forces, but he went so far as to suggest that earlier historiography was rife with falsified evidence and required new investigations at the source. Such an outlook was not unique in that the scientific spirit that 18th-century intellectuals perceived themselves as invested with. A rationalistic approach was key to rewriting history.<ref>Guillaume de Syon, \"Voltaire,\" in {{cite book|author=Kelly Boyd. ed.|title=Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing, vol 2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0121vD9STIMC&pg=PA1270|date=1999|publisher=Taylor & Francis|pages=1270\u201372|isbn=9781884964336}}</ref>\n\nVoltaire's best-known histories are ''[[The Age of Louis XIV]]'' (1751), and his ''[[Essai sur les m\u0153urs et l'esprit des nations|Essay on the Customs and the Spirit of the Nations]]'' (1756). He broke from the tradition of narrating diplomatic and military events, and emphasized customs, social history and achievements in the arts and sciences. He was the first scholar to make a serious attempt to write the history of the world, eliminating theological frameworks, and emphasizing economics, culture and political history. Although he repeatedly warned against political bias on the part of the historian, he did not miss many opportunities to expose the intolerance and frauds of the church over the ages. Voltaire advised scholars that anything contradicting the normal course of nature was not to be believed. Although he found evil in the historical record, he fervently believed reason and educating the illiterate masses would lead to progress.\n\nVoltaire explains his view of historiography in his article on \"History\" in Diderot's ''[[Encyclop\u00e9die]]'': ''\"One demands of modern historians more details, better ascertained facts, precise dates, more attention to customs, laws, mores, commerce, finance, agriculture, population.\"'' Already in 1739 he had written: ''\"My chief object is not political or military history, it is the history of the arts, of commerce, of civilization&nbsp;\u2013 in a word,&nbsp;\u2013 of the human mind.\"''<ref>{{cite book|author=E.

He emphasised the role of forces of the spirit in history and thought that chaotic events demanded what he called 'heroes' to take control over the competing forces erupting within society. He considered the dynamic forces of history as being the hopes and aspirations of people that took the form of ideas, and were often ossified into ideologies. Carlyle's ''The French Revolution'' was written in a highly unorthodox style, far removed from the neutral and detached tone of the tradition of Gibbon. Carlyle presented the history as dramatic events unfolding in the present as though he and the reader were participants on the streets of Paris at the famous events.

According to [[John Lukacs]], he was the first master of cultural history, which seeks to describe the spirit and the forms of expression of a particular age, a particular people, or a particular place.  His innovative approach to historical research stressed the importance of art and its inestimable value as a primary source for the study of history. He was one of the first historians to rise above the narrow nineteenth-century notion that \"history is past politics and politics current history.<ref>John Lukacs, Remembered Past: John Lukacs on History, Historians, and Historical Knowledge, ed.

[[Leopold von Ranke]] (1795\u20131886) at Berlin was a pivotal influence in this regard, and was the founder of modern source-based history.<ref>Frederick C.

Beginning with his first book in 1824, the ''History of the Latin and Teutonic Peoples from 1494 to 1514'', Ranke used an unusually wide variety of sources for a historian of the age, including \"memoirs, diaries, personal and formal missives, government documents, diplomatic dispatches and first-hand accounts of eye-witnesses\". Over a career that spanned much of the century, Ranke set the standards for much of later historical writing, introducing such ideas as reliance on [[primary source]]s, an emphasis on [[narrative history]] and especially international politics (''aussenpolitik'').<ref>E. Sreedharan, ''A textbook of historiography, 500&nbsp;BC to AD&nbsp;2000'' (2004) p. 185</ref>  Sources had to be solid, not speculations and rationalizations. His credo was to write history the way it was. He insisted on primary sources with proven authenticity.\n\nRanke also rejected the 'teleological approach' to history, which traditionally viewed each period as inferior to the period which follows. In Ranke's view, the historian had to understand a period on its own terms, and seek to find only the general ideas which animated every period of history. In 1831 and at the behest of the [[Prussia]]n government, Ranke founded and edited the first historical journal in the world, called ''Historisch-Politische Zeitschrift''.\n\nAnother important German thinker was [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], whose theory of historical progress ran counter to Ranke's approach. In Hegel's own words, his philosophical theory of \"World history... represents the development of the spirit's consciousness of its own [[Freedom of will|freedom]] and of the consequent realization of this freedom.\".<ref>''Lectures'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=pjfaimuprzoC&pg=PA138&hl=en&dq=%22represents+the+development+of+the+spirit's+consciousness+of+its+own+freedom+and+of+the+consequent+realisation+of+this+freedom.%22 p. 138].</ref> This realization is seen by studying the various cultures that have developed over the millennia, and trying to understand the way that freedom has worked itself out through them:\n\n<blockquote>World history is the record of the spirit's efforts to attain knowledge of what it is in itself.

The consciousness of freedom first awoke among the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], and they were accordingly free; but, like the Romans, they only knew that '''Some''', and not all men as such, are free.... The [[Germans#Middle Ages|Germanic nations]], with the rise of [[Christianity]], were the first to realize that '''All''' men are by nature free, and that freedom of spirit is his very essence.<ref>''Lectures'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=pjfaimuprzoC&pg=PA54&hl=en&dq=%22World+history+is+the+record+of+the+spirit's+efforts+to+attain+knowledge+of+what+it+is+in+itself.+The+Orientals+do+not+know+that+the+spirit+or+man+as+such+are+free+in+themselves.+And+because+they+do+not+know+that,+they+are+not+themselves+free.+They+only+know+that+One+is+free.%22%22The+consciousness+of+freedom+first+awoke+among+the+Greeks,+and+they+were+accordingly+free;+but,+like+the+Romans,+they+only+knew+that+Some,+and+not+all+men+as+such,+are+free%22%22The+Germanic+nations,+with+the+rise+of+Christianity,+were+the+first+to+realize+that+All+men+are+by+nature+free,+and+that+freedom+of+spirit+is+his+very+essence.%22 p. 54].</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n[[Karl Marx]] introduced the concept of [[historical materialism]] into the study of world historical development. In his conception, the economic conditions and dominant modes of production determined the structure of society at that point. In his view five successive stages in the development of material conditions would occur in [[Western Europe]]. The first stage was [[primitive communism]] where property was shared and there was no concept of \"leadership\". This progressed to a [[Slavery|slave society]] where the idea of [[Social class|class]] emerged and the [[State (polity)|State]] developed. [[Feudalism]] was characterized by an [[aristocracy]] working in partnership with a [[theocracy]] and the emergence of the [[Nation-state]]. [[Capitalism]] appeared after the bourgeois revolution when the capitalists (or their merchant predecessors) overthrew the feudal system and established a [[market economy]], with\n[[private property]] and [[Parliamentary democracy]]. Marx then predicted the eventual proletarian revolution that would result in the attainment of [[socialism]], followed by [[Communism]], where property would be communally owned.\n\nPrevious historians had focused on cyclical events of the rise and decline of rulers and nations. Process of [[nationalization of history]], as part of [[Romantic nationalism|national revivals]] in the 19th century, resulted with separation of \"one's own\" history from common [[universal history]] by such way of perceiving, understanding and treating the past that constructed history as history of a nation.<ref name = \"laboratory\">{{Cite book\n| url         = https://books.google.com/?id=f52rawP96lYC&pg=PA39&lpg=PA39&dq=%22nationalisation+of+history%22#v=onepage&q=%22nationalisation%20of%20history%22&f=false\n| title       = A Laboratory of Transnational History Ukraine and recent Ukrainian historiography\n| accessdate  = October 18, 2010\n| author      = Georgiy Kasianov, Philipp Terr\n| pages       = 7\n| quote       = This essay deals with, what I call, \"nationalized history\", meaning a way of perceiving, understanding and treating the past that requires separation of \"one's own\" history from \"common\" history and its construction as history of a nation.\n| isbn       = 978-1-84545-621-4\n| date         = 2010-04-07}}</ref> A new discipline, [[sociology]], emerged in the late 19th century and analyzed and compared these perspectives on a larger scale.\n\n===Macaulay and Whig history===\n[[File:Thomas Babington Macaulay, Baron Macaulay.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Macaulay]] was the most influential exponent of the [[Whig history]]]]\n\nThe term [[Whig history]], coined by [[Herbert Butterfield]] in his short book ''The Whig Interpretation of History'' in 1931, means the approach to historiography which presents the past as an inevitable progression towards ever greater liberty and enlightenment, culminating in modern forms of [[liberal democracy]] and [[constitutional monarchy]]. In general, Whig historians emphasized the rise of [[constitutional government]], [[personal freedom]]s and [[scientific progress]].

This model of human progress has been called the [[Whig history|Whig interpretation of history]].<ref>John Clive, ''Macaulay \u2013 the shaping of the historian'' (1975)</ref> He published the first volumes of his most famous work of history, ''[[The History of England from the Accession of James II]]'', in 1848.

The school emphasized the use of quantification and the paying of special attention to geography.<ref>See Lucien Febvre, ''La Terre et l'\u00e9volution humaine'' (1922), translated as ''A Geographical Introduction to History'' (London, 1932).</ref><ref>See [http://www.editions.ehess.fr/revues/annales-histoire-sciences-sociales/numeros-parus/ for recent issues]</ref>\n\nThe ''Annales d'histoire \u00e9conomique et sociale'' journal was founded in 1929 in [[Strasbourg]] by [[Marc Bloch]] and [[Lucien Febvre]]. These authors, the former a medieval historian and the latter an early modernist, quickly became associated with the distinctive ''Annales'' approach, which combined geography, history, and the sociological approaches of the [[Ann\u00e9e Sociologique]] (many members of which were their colleagues at Strasbourg) to produce an approach which rejected the predominant emphasis on politics, diplomacy and war of many 19th and early 20th-century historians as spearheaded by historians whom Febvre called Les Sorbonnistes. Instead, they pioneered an approach to a study of long-term historical structures (''la [[longue dur\u00e9e]]'') over events and political transformations.<ref>Colin Jones, \"Olwen Hufton's 'Poor', Richard Cobb's 'People', and the Notions of the longue dur\u00e9e in French Revolutionary Historiography\", ''Past & Present'', 2006 Supplement (Volume 1), pp. 178\u2013203 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/past_and_present/v2006/2006.1Sjones.html in Project Muse]</ref>  Geography, material culture, and what later Annalistes called ''mentalit\u00e9s'', or the psychology of the epoch, are also characteristic areas of study.

Braudel developed the idea, often associated with Annalistes, of different modes of historical time: ''l'histoire quasi immobile'' (motionless history) of historical geography, the history of social, political and economic structures (''la [[longue dur\u00e9e]]''), and the history of men and events, in the context of their structures. His 'longue dur\u00e9e' approach stressed slow, and often imperceptible effects of space, climate and technology on the actions of human beings in the past.  The ''Annales'' historians, after living through two world wars and major political upheavals in France, were deeply uncomfortable with the notion that multiple ruptures and discontinuities created history. They preferred to stress slow change and the longue dur\u00e9e. They paid special attention to geography, climate, and demography as long-term factors. They considered the continuities of the deepest structures were central to history, beside which upheavals in institutions or the superstructure of social life were of little significance, for history lies beyond the reach of conscious actors, especially the will of revolutionaries.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Olivia |last=Harris |title=Braudel: Historical Time and the Horror of Discontinuity |journal=[[History Workshop Journal]] |year=2004 |volume=57 |pages=161\u2013174 |issn=1363-3554 |url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/849/ |doi=10.1093/hwj/57.1.161 |citeseerx=10.1.1.693.9898 }} Only Ari\u00e8s was a true conservative\u2014indeed a royalist.</ref>\n\nNoting the political upheavals in Europe and especially in France in 1968, [[Eric Hobsbawm]] argued that \"in France the virtual hegemony of Braudelian history and the ''Annales'' came to an end after 1968, and the international influence of the journal dropped steeply.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Eric J.

[[Friedrich Engels]] wrote ''[[The Peasant War in Germany]]'', which analysed social warfare in early Protestant Germany in terms of emerging capitalist classes. Although it lacked a rigorous engagement with archival sources, it indicated an early interest in [[People's history|history from below]] and class analysis, and it attempts a dialectical analysis. Another treatise of Engels, ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'', was salient in creating the [[socialist]] impetus in British politics from then on, e.g. the [[Fabian Society]].\n\n[[R. H. Tawney]] was an early historian working in this tradition. ''The Agrarian Problem in the Sixteenth Century'' (1912)<ref>[[William Rose Ben\u00e9t]] (1988) p.&nbsp;961</ref> and ''Religion and the Rise of Capitalism'' (1926), reflected his ethical concerns and preoccupations in economic history. He was profoundly interested in the issue of the enclosure of land in the English countryside in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and in [[Max Weber]]'s thesis on the connection between the appearance of [[Protestantism]] and the rise of capitalism. His belief in the rise of the gentry in the century before the outbreak of the Civil War in England provoked the 'Storm over the Gentry' in which his methods were subjected to severe criticisms by [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]] and John Cooper.\n\n[[Historiography in the Soviet Union]] was greatly influenced by Marxist historiography, as [[historical materialism]] was extended into the Soviet version of [[dialectical materialism]].\n\nA circle of historians inside the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB) formed in 1946 and became a highly influential cluster of [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Marxist historiography|Marxist historians]], who contributed to [[history from below]] and class structure in early capitalist society. While some members of the group (most notably [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]] and [[E. P.

In his preface to this book, Thompson set out his approach to writing history from below:\n\n{{quote|text=I am seeking to rescue the poor stockinger, the [[Luddite]] cropper, the \"obsolete\" hand-loom weaver, the \"Utopian\" artisan, and even the deluded follower of [[Joanna Southcott]], from the enormous condescension of posterity. Their crafts and traditions may have been dying. Their hostility to the new industrialism may have been backward-looking. Their communitarian ideals may have been fantasies. Their insurrectionary conspiracies may have been foolhardy. But they lived through these times of acute social disturbance, and we did not. Their aspirations were valid in terms of their own experience; and, if they were casualties of history, they remain, condemned in their own lives, as casualties.}}\n\nThompson's work was also significant because of the way he defined \"class\". He argued that class was not a structure, but a relationship that changed over time. He opened the gates for a generation of labor historians, such as [[David Montgomery (historian)|David Montgomery]] and [[Herbert Gutman]], who made similar studies of the American working classes.\n\nOther important Marxist historians included [[Eric Hobsbawm]], [[C. L. R. James]], [[Raphael Samuel]], [[A. L. Morton]] and [[Brian Pearce]].\n\nAlthough Marxist historiography made important contributions to the history of the [[working class]], oppressed nationalities, and the [[methodology]] of [[People's history|history from below]], its chief problematic aspect was its argument on the nature of history as ''determined'' or ''dialectical''; this can also be stated as the relative importance of subjective and objective factors in creating outcomes. It increasingly fell out of favour in the 1960s and '70s. [[Geoffrey Elton]] was important in undermining the case for a [[Marxist historiography]], which he argued was presenting seriously flawed interpretations of the past. In particular, Elton was opposed to the idea that the [[English Civil War]] was caused by socioeconomic changes in the 16th and 17th centuries, arguing instead that it was due largely to the incompetence of the [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] kings.<ref>See his essays 'The Stuart Century', 'A High Road to Civil War?' and 'The Unexplained Revolution' in G. R. Elton, ''Studies in Tudor and Stuart Politics and Government: Volume II'' (Cambridge University Press, 1974).</ref>\n\nIn dealing with the era of the [[Second World War]], Addison notes that in Britain by the 1990s, labour history was, \"in sharp decline\", because:\n{{quote|there was no longer much interest in history of the white, male working-class.  Instead the 'cultural turn' encouraged historians to explore wartime constructions of gender, race, citizenship and national identity.<ref>Paul Addison and Harriet Jones, eds. ''A Companion to Contemporary Britain: 1939\u20132000'' (2005) p 4</ref>}}\n\n===Biography===\n{{Further|Biography}}\nBiography has been a major form of historiography since the days when [[Plutarch]] wrote the parallel lives of great Roman and Greek leaders. It is a field especially attractive to nonacademic historians, and often to the spouses or children of famous people, who have access to the trove of letters and documents. Academic historians tend to downplay biography because it pays too little attention to broad social, cultural, political and economic forces, and perhaps too much attention to popular psychology. The \"[[Great man theory|Great Man]]\" tradition in Britain originated in the multi-volume ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' (which originated in 1882 and issued updates into the 1970s); it continues to this day in the new ''[[Dictionary of National Biography|Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'.' In the United States, the ''[[Dictionary of American Biography]]'' was planned in the late 1920s and appeared with numerous supplements into the 1980s.  It has now been displaced by the ''[[American National Biography]]'' as well as numerous smaller historical encyclopedias that give thorough coverage to Great Persons. Bookstores do a thriving business in biographies, which sell far more copies than the esoteric monographs based on post-structuralism, cultural, racial or gender history. [[Michael Holroyd]] says the last forty years \"may be seen as a golden age of biography\", but nevertheless calls it the \"shallow end of history\". Nicolas Barker argues that \"more and more biographies command an ever larger readership\", as he speculates that biography has come \"to express the spirit of our age\".<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Riall | first1 = Lucy | year = 2010 | title = The Shallow End of History?

Meister argues that:\n{{quote|Biography Studies is emerging as an independent discipline, especially in the Netherlands. This Dutch School of biography is moving biography studies away from the less scholarly life writing tradition and towards history by encouraging its practitioners to utilize an approach adapted from microhistory.<ref>Daniel R.

H. Carr]] developed a controversial theory of history in his 1961 book ''[[What Is History?]]'', which proved to be one of the most influential books ever written on the subject.<ref name=\"Windshuttle\">{{cite web|last=Windshuttle|first=Keith|title=The Real Stuff of History|publisher=Sydney Line|year=2001|url=http://www.sydneyline.com/Real%20Stuff%20of%20History.htm|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211162744/http://www.sydneyline.com/Real%20Stuff%20of%20History.htm|archivedate=2008-12-11}}</ref> He presented a middle-of-the-road position between the empirical or  (Rankean) view of history and [[R. G. Collingwood]]'s idealism, and rejected the empirical view of the historian's work being an accretion of \"facts\" that they have at their disposal as nonsense.  He maintained that there is such a vast quantity of information that the historian always chooses the \"facts\" they decide to make use of. In Carr's famous example, he claimed that millions had crossed the Rubicon, but only Julius Caesar's crossing in 49 BC is declared noteworthy by historians.<ref name=\"Huges-Warrington, Marnie p. 26\">Huges-Warrington, p. 26</ref><ref>Carr, ''What Is History?'', p. 10;</ref> For this reason, Carr argued that [[Leopold von Ranke]]'s famous dictum ''wie es eigentlich gewesen'' (show what actually happened) was wrong because it presumed that the \"facts\" influenced what the historian wrote, rather than the historian choosing what \"facts of the past\" they intended to turn into \"historical facts\".<ref>Carr, ''What Is History?'', pp. 8\u201313</ref> At the same time, Carr argued that the study of the facts may lead the historian to change his or her views.  In this way, Carr argued that history was \"an unending dialogue between the past and present\".<ref name=\"Huges-Warrington, Marnie p. 26\"/><ref>Carr, ''What Is History?'', p. 30</ref>\n\nCarr is held by some critics to have had a deterministic outlook in history.<ref name=\"Huges-Warrington, Marnie p. 27\">Huges-Warrington, p. 27. One of his first and most influential critics was the British philosopher, Michael Oakeshott, 'What is History?' (1961), in idem, ''What is History and Other Essays'' (Exeter, 2004), 325.</ref> Others have modified or rejected this use of the label \"determinist\".<ref>See M. Hewitson, ''History and Causality'' (Basingstoke, 2014), pp. 86\u201393.</ref> He took a hostile view of those historians who stress the workings of chance and contingency in the workings of history. In Carr's view, no individual is truly free of the social environment in which they live, but contended that within those limitations, there was room, albeit very narrow room for people to make decisions that affect history.  Carr emphatically contended that history was a [[Social sciences|social science]], not an [[The arts|art]],<ref name=HW28>Huges-Warrington, p. 28</ref> because historians like scientists seek generalizations that helped to broaden the understanding of one's subject.<ref name=HW28/><ref>Carr, ''What Is History?'', p. 62</ref>\n\nOne of Carr's most forthright critics was [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]], who argued that Carr's dismissal of the \"might-have-beens of history\" reflected a fundamental lack of interest in examining historical causation.<ref>Trevor-Roper, pp. 72\u201373</ref> Trevor-Roper asserted that examining possible alternative outcomes of history was far from being a \"parlour-game\" was rather an essential part of the historians' work,<ref name=\"Trevor-Roper p. 73\">Trevor-Roper, p. 73</ref> as only by considering all possible outcomes of a given situation could a historian properly understand the period.\n\nThe controversy inspired Sir [[Geoffrey Elton]] to write his 1967 book ''The Practice of History''. Elton criticized Carr for his \"whimsical\" distinction between the \"historical facts\" and the \"facts of the past\", arguing that it reflected \"...an extraordinarily arrogant attitude both to the past and to the place of the historian studying it\".<ref>Elton, Geoffrey ''The Practice of History'', London: Methuen, 1967 pp. 56\u201357</ref> Elton, instead, strongly defended the traditional methods of history and was also appalled by the inroads made by [[postmodernism]].<ref>\u00d3 Tuathaigh, M. A. G., \u2018Irish Historical \", Revisionism\": State of the Art of Ideological Project?\u2019 in, Brady, Ciaran (ed.), Interpreting Irish History (Dublin, 2006), p. 325.</ref> Elton saw the duty of historians as empirically gathering evidence and objectively analyzing what the evidence has to say. As a traditionalist, he placed great emphasis on the role of individuals in history instead of abstract, impersonal forces. Elton saw political history as the highest kind of history. Elton had no use for those who seek history to make myths, to create laws to explain the past, or to produce theories such as [[Marxism]].\n\n===U.S. approaches===\n{{main|Historiography of the United States}}\nClassical and European history was part of the 19th-century grammar curriculum. American history became a topic later in the 19th century.<ref>Barry Joyce, ''The First U.S. History Textbooks: Constructing and Disseminating the American Tale in the Nineteenth Century'' (Lexington, 2015). viii, 335 pp.</ref>\n\nIn the historiography of the United States, there were a series of major approaches in the 20th century.  In 2009\u20132012, there were an average of 16,000 new academic history books published in the U.S. every year.<ref>See [http://www.humanitiesindicators.org/content/indicatordoc.aspx?i=88#fig393 table IV-12b]</ref>\n\n====Progressive historians====\nFrom 1910 to the 1940s, \"Progressive\" historiography was dominant, especially in political studies. It stressed the central importance of class conflict in American history. Important leaders included [[Vernon L. Parrington]], [[Carl L. Becker]], [[Arthur M. Schlesinger, Sr.]], John Hicks, and [[C. Vann Woodward]].<ref>John Higham, ''History: Professional Scholarship in America'' (1965) pp 171\u2013211</ref> The movement established a strong base at the History Department at the University of Wisconsin with Curtis Nettels, William Hesseltine, [[Merle Curti]], [[Howard K.

Beard]] was the most prominent representative with his \"Beardian\" approach that reached both scholars and the general public.<ref>Richard Hofstadter, ''The Progressive Historians: Turner, Beard, Parrington'' (1968)</ref>\n\nIn covering the Civil War, Charles and Mary Beard did not find it useful to examine nationalism, unionism, states' rights, slavery, abolition or the motivations of soldiers in battle.  Instead, they proclaimed it was a:\n:social cataclysm in which the capitalists, laborers, and farmers of the North and West drove from power in the national government the planting aristocracy of the South. Viewed under the light of universal history, the fighting was a fleeting incident; the social revolution was the essential portentous outcome.... The Second American Revolution, while destroying the economic foundation of the slave-owning aristocracy, assured the triumph of business enterprise.\"<ref>Charles A.  Beard and Mary R.  Beard, ''The Rise of American Civilization'' (1927) vol 2 pp 54, 166</ref>\n\n[[Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.]] wrote the ''Age of Jackson'' (1945), one of the last major books from this viewpoint. Schlesinger made Jackson a hero for his successful attacks on the [[Second Bank of the United States]]. His own views were clear enough: \"Moved typically by personal and class, rarely by public, considerations, the business community has invariably brought national affairs to a state of crisis and exasperated the rest of society into dissatisfaction bordering on revolt.\"<ref>Schlesinger, ''Age of Jackson'' (1945) p 521.</ref>\n\n====Consensus history====\n{{main|Consensus history}}\nConsensus history emphasizes the basic unity of American values and downplays conflict as superficial.  It was especially attractive in the 1950s and 1960s.

The goal was to incorporate in historical studies perspectives from all the social sciences, especially political science, sociology and economics. The pioneers shared a commitment to quantification. However, by the 1980s the first blush of quantification had worn off, as traditional historians counterattacked. [[Harvey J. Graff]] says:\n{{quote|The case against the new mixed and confused a lengthy list of ingredients, including the following: history\u2019s supposed loss of identity and humanity in the stain of social science, the fear of subordinating quality to quantity, conceptual and technical fallacies, violation of the literary character and biographical base of \", good\" history (rhetorical and aesthetic concern), loss of audiences, derogation of history rooted in \", great men\" and \", great events\", trivialization in general, a hodge-podge of ideological objections from all directions, and a fear that new historians were reaping research funds that might otherwise come to their detractors.

It focused on the examination of history from a global perspective and looked for common patterns that emerged across all cultures. The basic thematic approach of this field was to analyse two major focal points: [[syncretism|integration]]&nbsp;\u2013 (how processes of world history have drawn people of the world together), and difference&nbsp;\u2013 (how patterns of world history reveal the diversity of the human experience).\n\n[[Arnold J. Toynbee]]'s ten-volume ''[[A Study of History]]'', took an approach that was widely discussed in the 1930s and 1940s. By the 1960s his work was virtually ignored by scholars and the general public.  He compared 26 independent civilizations and argued that they displayed striking parallels in their origin, growth, and decay.  He proposed a universal model to each of these civilizations, detailing the stages through which they all pass: genesis, growth, time of troubles, universal state, and disintegration. The later volumes gave too much emphasis on spirituality to satisfy critics.<ref>William H. McNeill, ''Arnold J. Toynbee a Life'' (1989)</ref>\n\nChicago historian [[William Hardy McNeill|William H. McNeill]] wrote ''[[The Rise of the West]]'' (1965) to show how the separate civilizations of Eurasia interacted from the very beginning of their history, borrowing critical skills from one another, and thus precipitating still further change as adjustment between traditional old and borrowed new knowledge and practice became necessary. He then discusses the dramatic effect of [[Western culture|Western civilization]] on others in the past 500 years of history. McNeill took a broad approach organized around the interactions of peoples across the globe. Such interactions have become both more numerous and more continual and substantial in recent times. Before about 1500, the network of communication between cultures was that of Eurasia. The term for these areas of interaction differ from one world historian to another and include ''world-system'' and ''ecumene.''

The early journals were similar to those for the physical sciences, and were seen as a means for history to become more professional. Journals also helped historians to establish various historiographical approaches, the most notable example of which was ''[[Annales. \u00c9conomies, soci\u00e9t\u00e9s, civilisations]]'', a publication of the [[Annales school|''Annales'' school]] in France.  Journals now typically have one or more editors and associate editors, an editorial board, and a pool of scholars to whom articles that are submitted are sent for confidential evaluation.  The editors will send out new books to recognized scholars for reviews that usually run 500 to 1000 words. The vetting and publication process often takes months or longer. Publication in a prestigious journal (which accept 10% or fewer of the articles submitted) is an asset in the academic hiring and promotion process. Publication demonstrates that the author is conversant with the scholarly field.  Page charges and fees for publication are uncommon in history. Journals are subsidized by universities or historical societies, scholarly associations, and subscription fees from libraries and scholars. Increasingly they are available through library pools that allow many academic institutions to pool subscriptions to online versions. Most libraries have a system for obtaining specific articles through [[inter-library loan]].<ref>Margaret F.

In 1979, at a time when the new [[Social History]] was demanding a social-science model of analysis, Stone detected a move back toward the narrative. Stone defined narrative as follows: it is organized [[chronological]]ly; it is focused on a single coherent story; it is descriptive rather than analytical; it is concerned with people not abstract circumstances; and it deals with the particular and specific rather than the collective and statistical. He reported that, \"More and more of the 'new historians' are now trying to discover what was going on inside people's heads in the past, and what it was like to live in the past, questions which inevitably lead back to the use of narrative.\"<ref>Lawrence Stone, \"The Revival of Narrative: Reflections on a New Old History\", ''Past and Present'' 85 (Nov 1979) pp. 3\u201324, quote on p. 13</ref>\n\nHistorians committed to a social science approach, however, have criticized the narrowness of narrative and its preference for anecdote over analysis, and its use of clever examples rather than statistically verified empirical regularities.<ref>J.

(See also [[source criticism]]).\n# Historiographical tradition or framework. Every historian uses one (or more) historiographical traditions, for example [[Marxist]], [[Annales school|''Annales'' school]], \"total history\", or [[political history]].\n# [[morality|Moral]] issues, guilt assignment, and praise assignment\n# [[historical revisionism|Revisionism]] versus [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] interpretations\n# Historical [[metanarratives]] and metahistory.<ref>Nikola\u012d Onufrievich Losski\u012d -History of Russian Philosophy 1951 \u2013 - Page 245 \"It must not be imagined, however, that history and metahistory are entirely separate: \"Metahistory is continually present as the background of history.

But it implies going beyond, a transcendence of history and in this sense it is equated with metaphysics and theology. Sometimes historical time is distinguished from metahistorical eternity.\"</ref>\n\n==Approaches==\nHow a historian approaches historical events is one of the most important decisions within historiography. It is commonly recognised by historians that, in themselves, individual historical facts dealing with names, dates and places are not particularly meaningful. Such facts will only become useful when assembled with other historical evidence, and the process of assembling this evidence is understood as a particular historiographical approach.\n\nThe most influential historiographical approaches are:\n\n* [[Business history]]\n* [[Comparative history]]\n* [[Cultural history]]\n* [[Diplomatic history]]\n* [[Economic history]]\n* [[Environmental history]], a relatively new field\n* [[Ethnohistory]]\n* [[Gender history]] including [[Woman's history]], [[Family history]], [[Feminist history]]\n* [[History of medicine|History of Medicine]]\n* [[History of Religion]] and [[Church history|Church History]]; the history of theology is usually handled under [[Theology]]\n* [[Intellectual History]] and [[History of ideas]]\n* [[Labor history (discipline)|Labor history]]\n* [[Local History]] and [[Microhistory]]\n* [[Marxist historiography]] and [[Historical materialism]]\n* [[Military history]], including naval and air\n* [[Oral history]]\n* [[Political history]]\n* [[Public history]], especially museums and historic preservation\n* [[Quantitative history]], [[Cliometrics]] (in economic history); [[Prosopography]] using statistics to study biographies\n* [[History of religions]]\n* [[Historiography of science]] \n* [[Social history]] and [[People's history|History from below]]; along with the French version the [[Annales school|''Annales'' school]] and the German [[Bielefeld School]]\n* [[Subaltern Studies]], Regarding post-colonial India\n* [[Urban history]]\n** [[American urban history]]\n* [[Whig history]], History as the story of continuous progress\n* [[World history]]\n\n===Related fields===\nImportant related fields include:\n* [[Antiquarian]]ism\n* [[Genealogy]]\n* [[Numismatics]]\n* [[Intellectual history]]\n* [[Paleography]]\n* [[Philosophy of history]]\n* [[Pseudohistory]]\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[List of historians by area of study]]\n* [[Historical significance]]\n* [[National memory]]\n\n===Methods===\n* [[Archival research]]\n* [[Auxiliary sciences of history]]\n* [[Historical method]]\n* [[List of historians]], inclusive of most major historians\n** [[List of historians by area of study]]\n* [[List of history journals]]\n* [[Philosophy of history]]\n* [[Popular history]]\n** [[Primary source]]&nbsp;\u2013 documents, correspondence, diaries\n*** [[Secondary source]]&nbsp;\u2013 interpretations, written history\n**** [[Tertiary source]]&nbsp;\u2013 textbooks and encyclopedias\n* [[Public history]], including museums and historical preservation\n* [[Historical revisionism]]\n* [[Shared historical authority]]\n* [[v:Topic:Historiography|Historiography at Wikiversity]], where it is part of the [[v:School:History|School of History]]\n\n===Topics===\n* [[Historiography of Argentina]]\n* [[Atlantic history]]\n* [[Historiography of Canada]]\n* [[Chinese historiography]]\n* [[Classics]]\n** [[Greek historiography]] \n*** [[Historiography of Alexander the Great]]\n** [[Roman historiography]] \n*** [[Historiography of the fall of the Western Roman Empire]]\n* [[Historiography of the Cold War]]\n* [[Historiography of the French Revolution]]\n** [[Annales school|''Annales'' school]], in France\n* [[Historiography of Germany]] \n** [[Bielefeld School]], in Germany\n* [[History of India#Historiography]]\n** [[Historiography of the fall of the Mughal Empire]]\n* [[Historiography of early Islam]]\n* [[Historiography of Japan]]\n* [[Historiography of Korea]]\n** [[Korean nationalist historiography]]\n* [[History of Latin America|Latin American History]]\n* [[Middle Ages]]\n** [[Historiography of early Christianity]]\n** [[Historiography of feudalism#Historiography|Historiography of feudalism]]\n** [[Dark Ages (historiography)]]\n** [[Historiography of the Crusades]]\n* [[Historiography and nationalism]]\n* [[Historiography of Switzerland]]\n* [[Historiography in the Soviet Union]]\n* [[Historiography of the United States]]\n** [[Frontier Thesis]]\n* [[Historiography of the United Kingdom]]\n** [[Historiography of Scotland]]\n** [[Historiography of the British Empire]]\n* [[World history]]\n* [[Historiography of the causes of World War I]]\n* [[Historiography of World War II]]\n** [[Historiography of the Battle of France]], 1940\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Theory===\n* Appleby, Joyce, Lynn Hunt & Margaret Jacob, ''Telling the Truth About History''.

During that time, the selfless work of Wilson and his associates saved the lives of countless civilians and [[POW]]'s who would have otherwise perished at the hands of the aggressors.
