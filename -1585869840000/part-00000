A specialist in nineteenth and twentieth century Spanish literature he has published numerous books on Spanish Romanticism, with interpretive contributions and unpublished texts. He has edited the most faithful edition of the complete works of authors such as [[Jos\u00e9 de Espronceda]] and the [[\u00c1ngel de Saavedra, 3rd Duke of Rivas|Duque de Rivas]]. He has also written about [[Alberto Lista|Lista]] and Quintana and the work of Spanish progressive liberals from the early nineteenth century to the end of the period of Romanticism. He has studied the poetic thought of Juan Ram\u00f3n, [[Octavio Paz]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Bergamin]]. He has also dedicated numerous studies to the works of [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]]. He has studied the narrative of [[\u00c1lvaro Cunqueiro]], [[Juan Benet]], [[Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez Ruiz|Azor\u00edn]] and has a book pending publication about [[Ram\u00f3n del Valle-Incl\u00e1n|Valle-Incl\u00e1n]]. His concept of literary methodology stems from a new, non-Marxist approach to the binomial ideology and literature.\n\nHis concept of poetic works is based on what he has called the aesthetic of simplicity: he seeks the emotion of the reader with a simple yet refined style, full of lyricism and thought, which transparently offers an almost philosophical worldview, on topics such as love, the issue most frequently addressed in his work, death and the concept of art itself, poetic creation and beauty. In his recent novel ''\u00c9xito'' (Success) he offers a testimony to the vision of his generation from the beginning of counter-culture to the present day. Major Spanish writers have provided forwards for his creative works, which have been included in several Spanish and American anthologies. His poetic works have been translated into Italian and his narrative to English.\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n===Research publications===\n\n* ''La fantas\u00eda l\u00fadica de Alvaro Cunqueiro, pr\u00f3logo de \u00c1lvaro Cunqueiro'', Sada (Coru\u00f1a), Ediciones del Castro, 1980.\n* ''Estudios de literatura espa\u00f1ola'', Barcelona, Anthropos, 1987<ref>Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez S\u00e1nchez de Le\u00f3n, \"D.M.T.: Estudios de literatura espa\u00f1ola\", REVISTA DE LITERATURA (CSIC), LI, 101, 1989, pp. 235-237</ref>\n* ''Los liberales rom\u00e1nticos espa\u00f1oles ante la descolonizaci\u00f3n americana (1808-1834)'', Madrid, Editorial Mapfre, 1992, (Colecciones Mapfre 1492)\n* ''El alba del romanticismo espa\u00f1ol.

A specialist in nineteenth and twentieth century Spanish literature he has published numerous books on Spanish Romanticism, with interpretive contributions and unpublished texts. He has edited the most faithful edition of the complete works of authors such as [[Jos\u00e9 de Espronceda]] and the [[\u00c1ngel de Saavedra, 3rd Duke of Rivas|Duque de Rivas]]. He has also written about [[Alberto Lista|Lista]] and Quintana and the work of Spanish progressive liberals from the early nineteenth century to the end of the period of Romanticism. He has studied the poetic thought of Juan Ram\u00f3n, [[Octavio Paz]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Bergamin]]. He has also dedicated numerous studies to the works of [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]]. He has studied the narrative of [[\u00c1lvaro Cunqueiro]], [[Juan Benet]], [[Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez Ruiz|Azor\u00edn]] and has a book pending publication about [[Ram\u00f3n del Valle-Incl\u00e1n|Valle-Incl\u00e1n]]. His concept of literary methodology stems from a new, non-Marxist approach to the binomial ideology and literature.\n\nHis concept of poetic works is based on what he has called the aesthetic of simplicity: he seeks the emotion of the reader with a simple yet refined style, full of lyricism and thought, which transparently offers an almost philosophical worldview, on topics such as love, the issue most frequently addressed in his work, death and the concept of art itself, poetic creation and beauty. In his recent novel ''\u00c9xito'' (Success) he offers a testimony to the vision of his generation from the beginning of counter-culture to the present day. Major Spanish writers have provided forwards for his creative works, which have been included in several Spanish and American anthologies. His poetic works have been translated into Italian and his narrative to English.\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n===Research publications===\n\n* ''La fantas\u00eda l\u00fadica de Alvaro Cunqueiro, pr\u00f3logo de \u00c1lvaro Cunqueiro'', Sada (Coru\u00f1a), Ediciones del Castro, 1980.\n* ''Estudios de literatura espa\u00f1ola'', Barcelona, Anthropos, 1987<ref>Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez S\u00e1nchez de Le\u00f3n, \"D.M.T.: Estudios de literatura espa\u00f1ola\", REVISTA DE LITERATURA (CSIC), LI, 101, 1989, pp. 235-237</ref>\n* ''Los liberales rom\u00e1nticos espa\u00f1oles ante la descolonizaci\u00f3n americana (1808-1834)'', Madrid, Editorial Mapfre, 1992, (Colecciones Mapfre 1492)\n* ''El alba del romanticismo espa\u00f1ol.

In 1990, Tyson lost the titles to underdog [[Buster Douglas]], who knocked him out in the tenth round.

After his release in 1995, he engaged in a series of comeback fights. He won the WBC and WBA titles in 1996, after stopping [[Frank Bruno]] and [[Bruce Seldon]]. With his defeat of Bruno, Tyson joined [[Floyd Patterson]], [[Muhammad Ali]], [[Tim Witherspoon]], [[Evander Holyfield]], and [[George Foreman]] as the only men in boxing history to have regained a heavyweight championship after having lost it. After being stripped of the WBC title in the same year, Tyson [[Mike Tyson vs. Evander Holyfield|lost the WBA title to Evander Holyfield]] by an eleventh round stoppage.

However, Spinks did become the lineal champion by beating Holmes and many (including [[The Ring (magazine)|''Ring'']] magazine) considered him to have a legitimate claim to being the true heavyweight champion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/crowning-recognizing-lineal-champion-part-i--18453|title=Crowning and Recognizing A Lineal Champion|publisher=BoxingScene|author=Jake Donovan}}</ref> The bout was, at the time, the richest fight in history and expectations were very high.

He won the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] title in 1986 after stopping [[Trevor Berbick]] in the second round, and added the [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] and [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] titles after defeating [[James Smith (boxer)|James Smith]] and [[Tony Tucker]] in 1987. This made Tyson the first heavyweight boxer to simultaneously hold the WBA, WBC and IBF titles, and the only heavyweight to successively unify them.\n\nTyson became the [[lineal champion]] in 1988 when he knocked out [[Michael Spinks]] in 91 seconds of the first round.<ref name=CBZ>{{cite web|title=\"Iron\" Mike Tyson|url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/tysonrec.htm|publisher=Cyber Boxing Zone|accessdate=November 20, 2016}}</ref> He successfully defended his titles nine times, which included victories over [[Larry Holmes]] and [[Frank Bruno]]. In 1990, Tyson lost the titles to underdog [[Buster Douglas]], who knocked him out in the tenth round. Attempting to regain the titles, Tyson defeated [[Donovan Ruddock]] twice in 1991, but pulled out of a fight with then-undisputed heavyweight champion [[Evander Holyfield]] (who had defeated Douglas later in 1990) due to a rib injury.\n\nIn 1992, Tyson was convicted of rape and sentenced to six years in prison; he was released on parole after serving three years. After his release in 1995, he engaged in a series of comeback fights. He won the WBC and WBA titles in 1996, after stopping [[Frank Bruno]] and [[Bruce Seldon]]. With his defeat of Bruno, Tyson joined [[Floyd Patterson]], [[Muhammad Ali]], [[Tim Witherspoon]], [[Evander Holyfield]], and [[George Foreman]] as the only men in boxing history to have regained a heavyweight championship after having lost it. After being stripped of the WBC title in the same year, Tyson [[Mike Tyson vs. Evander Holyfield|lost the WBA title to Evander Holyfield]] by an eleventh round stoppage. Their [[Evander Holyfield vs. Mike Tyson II|1997 rematch]] ended when Tyson was disqualified for biting Holyfield's ears.\n\nIn 2002, Tyson fought for the world heavyweight title again at the age of 35, losing by knockout to [[Lennox Lewis]]. Tyson retired from professional boxing in 2006, after being knocked out in consecutive matches against [[Journeyman (boxing)|journeymen]] [[Danny Williams (boxer)|Danny Williams]] and [[Kevin McBride]].

Wessman began to learn a variety of tattoo styles at the shop, where the clientele included sailors, pimps, and prostitutes.<ref name=\"nostro\"/> One of the About Face Tattoo artists, Milford Barnes, moved to Lucky's Tattoo Parlor, a well-known shop in [[San Diego]], CA, owned and operated by Dave Gibson, and Wessman followed him there to begin an unofficial apprenticeship.<ref name=\"inked\"/> At the time, Wessman was working as an electrician. He would work as an electrician in the morning and spend his evenings apprenticing at the tattoo shop. Eventually, a spot/opportunity became available and he began tattooing full-time.<ref name=\"nostro\"/><ref name=\"inked\"/> At age 21, Wessman bought Lucky's Tattoo Parlor, which he owned and operated for ten years with fellow tattoo artist Shane Modica.<ref name=\"nostro\"/>\n\nFrom 2005 to 2010, Wessman worked at Love Hate Tattoo and was featured on the [[TLC (TV network)|TLC]] [[reality television|reality TV show]] ''[[Miami Ink]]''.
