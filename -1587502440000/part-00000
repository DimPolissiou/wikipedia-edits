King was also a singer who often incorporated [[music]] into her civil rights work. King met her husband while attending graduate school in [[Boston]]. They both became increasingly active in the [[Civil rights movement|American Civil Rights Movement]].\n\nKing played a prominent role in the years after [[Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|her husband's assassination]] in 1968 when she took on the leadership of the struggle for racial equality herself and became active in the [[Second-wave feminism|Women's Movement]]. King founded the [[King Center for Nonviolent Social Change|King Center]] and sought to make his birthday a national holiday. She finally succeeded when [[Ronald Reagan]] signed legislation which established [[Martin Luther King Jr. Day]] on November 2, 1983. She later broadened her scope to include both [[LGBT rights in the United States|advocacy for LGBT rights]] and opposition to [[apartheid]]. King became friends with many politicians before and after Martin Luther King's death, including [[John F. Kennedy]], [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], and [[Robert F. Kennedy]]. Her telephone conversation with John F. Kennedy during the [[1960 United States presidential election|1960 presidential election]] has been credited by historians for mobilizing African-American voters.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nIn August 2005, King suffered a stroke which paralyzed her right side and left her unable to speak; five months later she died of respiratory failure due to complications from ovarian cancer. Her funeral was attended by some 10,000 people, including four of five living US presidents. She was temporarily buried on the grounds of the King Center until being interred next to her husband.

Coretta was the only one remaining after Powell named two girls and King proved to not be impressed with the other. Scott initially showed little interest in meeting him, even after Powell told her that he had a promising future, but eventually relented and agreed to the meeting. King called her on the telephone and when the two met in person, Scott was surprised by how short he was. King would tell her that she had all the qualities that he was looking for in a wife, which Scott dismissed since the two had only just met.<ref>Fleming, p. 16.</ref> She told him \"I don't see how you can say that.

However, since King possessed many of the qualities she liked in a man, she found herself \"becoming more involved with every passing moment.\" When asked by her sister what made King so \"appealing\" to her she responded, \"I suppose it's because Martin reminds me so much of our father.\" At that moment, Scott's sister knew King was \"the one.\"<ref name=Bagley99 />\n\nKing's parents visited him in the fall and had suspicions about Coretta Scott after seeing how clean his apartment was. While the Kings had tea and meals with their son and Scott, Martin Sr. turned his attention to her and insinuated that her plans of a career in music were not fitting for a Baptist minister's wife. After Coretta did not respond to his questioning of their romance being serious, Martin Sr. asked if she took his son \"seriously\".<ref name=Branch98>Branch, p. 98.</ref> King's father also told her that there were many other women his son was interested in and had \"a lot to offer.\" After telling him that she had \"a lot to offer\" as well, Martin Luther King Sr. and his wife went on to try and meet with members of Coretta's family. Once the two obtained Edythe's number from Coretta, they sat down with her and had lunch with her. During their time together, Martin Luther King Sr. tried to ask Edythe about the relationship between her sister and his son.

After completing her degree in voice and piano at the New England Conservatory, she moved with her husband to [[Montgomery, Alabama]], in September 1954. Mrs. King recalled: \"After we married, we moved to Montgomery, Alabama, where my husband had accepted an invitation to be the pastor of Dexter Avenue Baptist Church. Before long, we found ourselves in the middle of the Montgomery bus boycott, and Martin was elected leader of the protest movement. As the boycott continued, I had a growing sense that I was involved in something so much greater than myself, something of profound historic importance. I came to the realization that we had been thrust into the forefront of a movement to liberate oppressed people, not only in Montgomery but also throughout our country, and this movement had worldwide implications.

By the end of the boycott, Mrs. King and her husband had come to believe in [[nonviolent]] protests as a way of expression consistent with biblical teachings.<ref>Bagley, p. 144.</ref> Two days after the integration of Montgomery's bus service, on December 23, a gunshot rang through the front door of the King home while King, her husband and Yolanda were asleep. The three were not harmed.<ref>Garrow, p. 83.</ref> On Christmas Eve of 1955, King took her daughter to her parents' house and met with her siblings as well. Yolanda was their first grandchild. King's husband joined them the next day, at dinner time.<ref>Bagley, p. 124.</ref>\n\nOn February 21, 1956, King's husband announced he would return to Montgomery after picking up Coretta and their daughter from Atlanta, who were staying with his parents. During Martin Luther King Sr.'s opposition to his son's choice to return to Montgomery, Mrs. King picked up her daughter and went upstairs, which he would express dismay in later and tell her that she \"had run out on him.\" Two days later, Coretta and her husband drove back to Montgomery.<ref>Garrow, p. 65.</ref> Coretta took an active role in advocating for civil rights legislation.  On April 25, 1958, King made her first appearance at a concert that year at Peter High School Auditorium in [[Birmingham, Alabama]]. With a performance sponsored by the Omicron Lambda chapter of [[Alpha Phi Alpha]] fraternity, King changed a few songs in the first part of the show but still continued with the basic format used two years earlier at the New York gala as she told the story of the Montgomery Bus Boycott. The concert was important for Coretta as a way to continue her professional career and participate in the movement. The concert gave the audience \"an emotional connection to the messages of social, economic, and spiritual transformation.\"<ref>Bagley, p. 150.</ref>\n\nOn September 3, 1958, King accompanied her husband and [[Ralph Abernathy]] to a courtroom. Her husband was arrested outside the courtroom for \"loitering\" and \"failing to obey an officer.\"<ref>Darby, p. 47.</ref> A few weeks later, King visited Martin's parents in Atlanta. At that time, she learned that he had been stabbed while signing copies of his book ''[[Stride Toward Freedom]]'' on September 20, 1958. King rushed to see her husband, and stayed with him for the remainder of his time in the hospital recovering.<ref>McPherson, p. 46.</ref> On February 3, 1959, King, her husband and [[Lawrence Reddick]] started a five-week tour of India. The three were invited to hundreds of engagements.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/india-trip|title=India Trip (1959)}}</ref> During their trip, Coretta used her singing ability to enthuse crowds during their month-long stay. The two returned to the United States on March 10, 1959.<ref>Darby, p. 51.</ref>\n\n===House bombing===\nOn January 30, 1956, Coretta and Dexter congregation member Roscoe Williams's wife Mary Lucy heard the \"sound of a brick striking the concrete floor of the front porch.\" Coretta suggested that the two women get out of the front room and went into the guest room, as the house was disturbed by an explosion which caused the house to rock and fill the front room with smoke and shattered glass. The two went to the rear of the home, where Yolanda was sleeping and Coretta called the First Baptist Church and reported the bombing to the woman who answered the phone.<ref>Garrow, pp. 59\u201360.</ref> Martin returned to their home, and upon finding Coretta and his daughter unharmed, went outside. He was confronted by an angry crowd of his supporters, who had brought guns. He was able to turn them away with an [[impromptu]] speech.<ref>Burns, p. 134.</ref>\n\nA white man was reported by a lone witness to have walked halfway up to King's door and thrown something against the door before running back to his car and speeding off. Ernest Walters, the lone witness, did not manage to get the license plate number because of how quickly the events transpired.<ref>Gibson Robinson, p. 131.</ref> Both of the couple's fathers contacted them over the bombing. The two arrived nearly at the same time, along with her husband's mother and brother. Coretta's father Obie said he would take her and her daughter back to Marion if his son-in-law did not take them to Atlanta. Coretta refused the proclamation and insisted on staying with her husband.<ref>Garrow, p. 61.</ref> Despite Martin Luther King Sr. also advocating that she leave with her father, King persisted in leaving with him. Author Octavia B. Vivian wrote \"That night Coretta lost her fear of dying. She committed herself more deeply to the freedom struggle, as Martin had done four days previously when jailed for the first time in his life.\" Coretta would later call it the first time she realized \"how much I meant to Martin in terms of supporting him in what he was doing\".<ref>Vivian, p. 20.</ref>\n\n===John F. Kennedy phone call===\nMartin Luther King was jailed on October 19, 1960, for picketing in a department store. After being released three days later, Coretta's husband was sent back to jail on October 22 for driving with an Alabama license while being a resident of Georgia and was sent to jail for four months of hard labor. After her husband's arrest, King believed he would not make it out alive and telephoned her friend [[Harris Wofford]] and cried while saying \"They're going to kill him. I know they are going to kill him.\" Directly after speaking with her, Wofford contacted [[Sargent Shriver]] in Chicago, where presidential candidate [[John F. Kennedy]] was campaigning at the time and told Shriver of King's fears for her husband. After Shriver waited to be with Kennedy alone, he suggested that he telephone King and express sympathy.<ref>O'Brien, p. 485.</ref> Kennedy called King, after agreeing to the proposal.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nSometime afterward, [[Robert Kennedy|Bobby Kennedy]] obtained King's release from prison. Martin Luther King Sr. was so grateful for the release that he voted for Kennedy and said: \"I'll take a Catholic or the devil himself if he'll wipe the tears from my daughter-in-law's eyes.\"<ref>Goduti, p. 39.</ref> According to Coretta, Kennedy said \"I want to express my concern about your husband. I know this must be very hard on you. I understand you are expecting a baby, and I just want you to know that I was thinking about you and Dr. King. If there is anything I can do to help, please feel free to call on me.\" Kennedy's contact with King was learned about quickly by reporters, with Coretta admitting that it \"made me feel good that he called me personally and let me know how he felt.\"<ref>Matthews, p. 171.</ref>\n\n===Kennedy presidency===\nDuring Kennedy's presidency, she and her husband had come to respect him and understood his reluctance at times to get involved openly with civil rights.<ref>Bagley, p. 192.</ref> In April 1962, Coretta served as a delegate for the Women's Strike for Peace Conference in Geneva, Switzerland.<ref>McCarty, p. xiii.</ref> Martin drove her to the hospital on March 28, 1963, where King gave birth to their fourth child [[Bernice King|Bernice.]] After King and her daughter were due to come home, Martin rushed back to drive them himself.<ref>McPherson, p. 56.</ref>\nAfter her husband's arrest on April 12, 1963, King tried to make direct contact with President Kennedy at the advisement of [[Wyatt Tee Walker]] and succeeded in speaking with Robert F. Kennedy. President Kennedy was with his father [[Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr]], who was not feeling well.<ref>Mahoney, p. 247</ref> In what has been noted as making Kennedy seem less sympathetic towards the Kings, the president redirected Mrs. King's call to the White House switchboard.<ref name=Branch736>Branch, p. 736.</ref>\n\nThe next day, President Kennedy reported to King that the FBI had been sent into Birmingham the previous night and confirmed that her husband was fine. He was allowed to speak with her on the phone and told her to inform Walker of Kennedy's involvement.<ref>Fairclough, p. 77.</ref> She told her husband of her assistance from the Kennedys, which her husband took as the reason \"why everybody is suddenly being so polite.\"<ref>Schlesinger, p. 328.</ref> Regarding the [[March on Washington]], Coretta said, \"It was as though heaven had come down.\"<ref>Willis, p. 166.</ref> Coretta had been home all day with their children, since the birth of their daughter Bernice had not allowed her to attend Easter Sunday church services.<ref>McPherson, p. 57.</ref> Since Mrs. King had issued her own statement regarding the aid of the president instead of doing as her husband had told her and report to [[Wyatt Walker]], this according to author [[Taylor Branch]], made her portrayed by reports as \"an anxious new mother who may have confused her White House fantasies with reality.\"<ref name=Branch736 />\n\nCoretta went to a Women Strike for Peace rally in New York, in the early days of November 1963. After speaking at the meeting held in the National Baptist Church, King joined the march from Central Park to the United Nations Headquarters. The march was timed to celebrate the group's second anniversary and celebrated the successful completion of the Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Coretta and Martin learned of [[John F. Kennedy assassination|John F. Kennedy's assassination]] when reports initially indicated he had only been seriously wounded. King joined her husband upstairs and watched [[Walter Cronkite]] announce the president's death. King sat with her visibly shaken husband following the confirmation.<ref>Bagley, p. 181.</ref>\n\n===FBI tapes===\n{{Main|FBI\u2013King suicide letter}}\n\n[[File:HHH-CKS-MLK-1964.jpg|thumb|right|Coretta Scott with [[Martin Luther King, Jr.|her husband]] and Vice President-elect [[Hubert Humphrey]] on December 17, 1964]]\nThe FBI planned to [[FBI\u2013King suicide letter|mail tapes]] of her husband's alleged affairs to the Southern Christian Leadership Conference office since surveillance revealed that Coretta opened her husband's mail when he was traveling.

Publicly, Mrs. King would say \"I couldn't make much out of it, it was just a lot of mumbo-jumbo.\"<ref>Dyson, p. 217.</ref> The tapes were part of a larger attempt by J.

King was also a singer who often incorporated [[music]] into her civil rights work. King met her husband while attending graduate school in [[Boston]]. They both became increasingly active in the [[Civil rights movement|American Civil Rights Movement]].\n\nKing played a prominent role in the years after [[Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|her husband's assassination]] in 1968 when she took on the leadership of the struggle for racial equality herself and became active in the [[Second-wave feminism|Women's Movement]]. King founded the [[King Center for Nonviolent Social Change|King Center]] and sought to make his birthday a national holiday. She finally succeeded when [[Ronald Reagan]] signed legislation which established [[Martin Luther King Jr. Day]] on November 2, 1983. She later broadened her scope to include both [[LGBT rights in the United States|advocacy for LGBT rights]] and opposition to [[apartheid]]. King became friends with many politicians before and after Martin Luther King's death, including [[John F. Kennedy]], [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], and [[Robert F. Kennedy]]. Her telephone conversation with John F.

Her funeral was attended by some 10,000 people, including four of five living US presidents. She was temporarily buried on the grounds of the King Center until being interred next to her husband.

Coretta's maternal grandfather, Martin, was born to a slave of [[Black Indians|Black Native American]] ancestry, and her white master who never acknowledged Martin as his son. He eventually owned a 280-acre farm. Because of his diverse origins, Martin appeared to be [[White people|white]]. However, he displayed contempt for the notion of [[Passing (racial identity)|passing]]. As a self-taught reader with little formal education, he is noted for having inspired Coretta's passion for education. Coretta's paternal grandparents were Cora (n\u00e9e McLaughlin; 1876 \u2013 1920) and Jefferson F. Scott (1873\u20131941). Cora died before Coretta's birth.

She also became politically active, due largely to her experience of [[racial discrimination]] by the local [[board of education|school board]]. She became active in the nascent civil rights movement; she joined the Antioch chapter of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) and the college's Race Relations and Civil Liberties Committees.

Coretta was the only one remaining after Powell named two girls and King proved to not be impressed with the other. Scott initially showed little interest in meeting him, even after Powell told her that he had a promising future, but eventually relented and agreed to the meeting. King called her on the telephone and when the two met in person, Scott was surprised by how short he was. King would tell her that she had all the qualities that he was looking for in a wife, which Scott dismissed since the two had only just met.<ref>Fleming, p. 16.</ref> She told him \"I don't see how you can say that. You don't even know me.\" But King was assured and asked to see her again. She readily accepted his invitation to a weekend party.<ref>Dyson, p. 212.</ref>\n\nShe continued to see him regularly in the early months of 1952. Two weeks after meeting Scott, King wrote to his mother that he had met his wife.<ref>Bagley, pp.  96\u201398.</ref> Their dates usually consisted of political and racial discussions, and in August of that year Coretta met King's parents [[Martin Luther King, Sr.]] and [[Alberta Williams King]].<ref>Garrow, pp. 45\u201346.</ref> Before meeting Martin, Coretta had been in relationships her entire time in school but never had any she cared to develop.<ref>Bagley, p. 96.</ref> Once meeting with her sister Edythe face-to-face, Coretta detailed her feelings for the young aspiring minister and discussed the relationship as well.

However, since King possessed many of the qualities she liked in a man, she found herself \"becoming more involved with every passing moment.\" When asked by her sister what made King so \"appealing\" to her she responded, \"I suppose it's because Martin reminds me so much of our father.\" At that moment, Scott's sister knew King was \"the one.\"<ref name=Bagley99 />\n\nKing's parents visited him in the fall and had suspicions about Coretta Scott after seeing how clean his apartment was. While the Kings had tea and meals with their son and Scott, Martin Sr. turned his attention to her and insinuated that her plans of a career in music were not fitting for a Baptist minister's wife. After Coretta did not respond to his questioning of their romance being serious, Martin Sr. asked if she took his son \"seriously\".<ref name=Branch98>Branch, p. 98.</ref> King's father also told her that there were many other women his son was interested in and had \"a lot to offer.\" After telling him that she had \"a lot to offer\" as well, Martin Luther King Sr. and his wife went on to try and meet with members of Coretta's family. Once the two obtained Edythe's number from Coretta, they sat down with her and had lunch with her. During their time together, Martin Luther King Sr. tried to ask Edythe about the relationship between her sister and his son. Edythe insisted that her sister was an excellent choice for Martin Luther King Jr., but also felt that Coretta did not need to bargain for a husband.<ref name=Bagley100>Bagley, p. 100.</ref>\n\nOn [[Valentine's Day]] 1953, the couple announced their plans to marry in the ''Atlanta Daily World''.

After completing her degree in voice and piano at the New England Conservatory, she moved with her husband to [[Montgomery, Alabama]], in September 1954. Mrs. King recalled: \"After we married, we moved to Montgomery, Alabama, where my husband had accepted an invitation to be the pastor of Dexter Avenue Baptist Church. Before long, we found ourselves in the middle of the Montgomery bus boycott, and Martin was elected leader of the protest movement. As the boycott continued, I had a growing sense that I was involved in something so much greater than myself, something of profound historic importance. I came to the realization that we had been thrust into the forefront of a movement to liberate oppressed people, not only in Montgomery but also throughout our country, and this movement had worldwide implications.

It was a sacrifice for Coretta, who had to give up her dreams of becoming a classical singer. Her devotion to the cause while giving up on her own ambitions would become symbolic of the actions of African American women during the movement.<ref>Nazel, p. 69.</ref> The couple moved into the church's parsonage on South Jackson Street shortly after this. Coretta became a member of the choir and taught Sunday school, as well as participating in the Baptist Training Union and Missionary Society. She made her first appearance at the First Baptist Church on March 6, 1955, where according to E. P. Wallace, she \"captivated her concert audience.\"<ref>Bagley, p. 108.</ref>\n\nThe Kings welcomed their first child [[Yolanda King|Yolanda]] on November 17, 1955, who was named at Coretta's insistence and became the church's attention.<ref>Bagley, p. 111.</ref> After her husband became involved in the [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]], King often received threats directed towards him. In January 1956, King answered numerous phone calls threatening her husband's life, as rumors intended to make African Americans dissatisfied with King's husband spread that Martin had purchased a Buick station wagon for her.<ref>Bagley, p. 125.</ref> Martin Luther King Jr. would give her the nickname \"Yoki,\" and thereby, allow himself to refer to her out of her name. By the end of the boycott, Mrs. King and her husband had come to believe in [[nonviolent]] protests as a way of expression consistent with biblical teachings.<ref>Bagley, p. 144.</ref> Two days after the integration of Montgomery's bus service, on December 23, a gunshot rang through the front door of the King home while King, her husband and Yolanda were asleep. The three were not harmed.<ref>Garrow, p. 83.</ref> On Christmas Eve of 1955, King took her daughter to her parents' house and met with her siblings as well. Yolanda was their first grandchild. King's husband joined them the next day, at dinner time.<ref>Bagley, p. 124.</ref>\n\nOn February 21, 1956, King's husband announced he would return to Montgomery after picking up Coretta and their daughter from Atlanta, who were staying with his parents. During Martin Luther King Sr.'s opposition to his son's choice to return to Montgomery, Mrs. King picked up her daughter and went upstairs, which he would express dismay in later and tell her that she \"had run out on him.\" Two days later, Coretta and her husband drove back to Montgomery.<ref>Garrow, p. 65.</ref> Coretta took an active role in advocating for civil rights legislation.  On April 25, 1958, King made her first appearance at a concert that year at Peter High School Auditorium in [[Birmingham, Alabama]]. With a performance sponsored by the Omicron Lambda chapter of [[Alpha Phi Alpha]] fraternity, King changed a few songs in the first part of the show but still continued with the basic format used two years earlier at the New York gala as she told the story of the Montgomery Bus Boycott. The concert was important for Coretta as a way to continue her professional career and participate in the movement. The concert gave the audience \"an emotional connection to the messages of social, economic, and spiritual transformation.\"<ref>Bagley, p. 150.</ref>\n\nOn September 3, 1958, King accompanied her husband and [[Ralph Abernathy]] to a courtroom. Her husband was arrested outside the courtroom for \"loitering\" and \"failing to obey an officer.\"<ref>Darby, p. 47.</ref> A few weeks later, King visited Martin's parents in Atlanta. At that time, she learned that he had been stabbed while signing copies of his book ''[[Stride Toward Freedom]]'' on September 20, 1958. King rushed to see her husband, and stayed with him for the remainder of his time in the hospital recovering.<ref>McPherson, p. 46.</ref> On February 3, 1959, King, her husband and [[Lawrence Reddick]] started a five-week tour of India. The three were invited to hundreds of engagements.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/india-trip|title=India Trip (1959)}}</ref> During their trip, Coretta used her singing ability to enthuse crowds during their month-long stay.

The two went to the rear of the home, where Yolanda was sleeping and Coretta called the First Baptist Church and reported the bombing to the woman who answered the phone.<ref>Garrow, pp. 59\u201360.</ref> Martin returned to their home, and upon finding Coretta and his daughter unharmed, went outside. He was confronted by an angry crowd of his supporters, who had brought guns. He was able to turn them away with an [[impromptu]] speech.<ref>Burns, p. 134.</ref>\n\nA white man was reported by a lone witness to have walked halfway up to King's door and thrown something against the door before running back to his car and speeding off. Ernest Walters, the lone witness, did not manage to get the license plate number because of how quickly the events transpired.<ref>Gibson Robinson, p. 131.</ref> Both of the couple's fathers contacted them over the bombing. The two arrived nearly at the same time, along with her husband's mother and brother. Coretta's father Obie said he would take her and her daughter back to Marion if his son-in-law did not take them to Atlanta. Coretta refused the proclamation and insisted on staying with her husband.<ref>Garrow, p. 61.</ref> Despite Martin Luther King Sr. also advocating that she leave with her father, King persisted in leaving with him. Author Octavia B. Vivian wrote \"That night Coretta lost her fear of dying. She committed herself more deeply to the freedom struggle, as Martin had done four days previously when jailed for the first time in his life.\" Coretta would later call it the first time she realized \"how much I meant to Martin in terms of supporting him in what he was doing\".<ref>Vivian, p. 20.</ref>\n\n===John F. Kennedy phone call===\nMartin Luther King was jailed on October 19, 1960, for picketing in a department store. After being released three days later, Coretta's husband was sent back to jail on October 22 for driving with an Alabama license while being a resident of Georgia and was sent to jail for four months of hard labor. After her husband's arrest, King believed he would not make it out alive and telephoned her friend [[Harris Wofford]] and cried while saying \"They're going to kill him. I know they are going to kill him.\" Directly after speaking with her, Wofford contacted [[Sargent Shriver]] in Chicago, where presidential candidate [[John F. Kennedy]] was campaigning at the time and told Shriver of King's fears for her husband. After Shriver waited to be with Kennedy alone, he suggested that he telephone King and express sympathy.<ref>O'Brien, p. 485.</ref> Kennedy called King, after agreeing to the proposal.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nSometime afterward, [[Robert Kennedy|Bobby Kennedy]] obtained King's release from prison. Martin Luther King Sr. was so grateful for the release that he voted for Kennedy and said: \"I'll take a Catholic or the devil himself if he'll wipe the tears from my daughter-in-law's eyes.\"<ref>Goduti, p. 39.</ref> According to Coretta, Kennedy said \"I want to express my concern about your husband. I know this must be very hard on you. I understand you are expecting a baby, and I just want you to know that I was thinking about you and Dr. King. If there is anything I can do to help, please feel free to call on me.\" Kennedy's contact with King was learned about quickly by reporters, with Coretta admitting that it \"made me feel good that he called me personally and let me know how he felt.\"<ref>Matthews, p. 171.</ref>\n\n===Kennedy presidency===\nDuring Kennedy's presidency, she and her husband had come to respect him and understood his reluctance at times to get involved openly with civil rights.<ref>Bagley, p. 192.</ref> In April 1962, Coretta served as a delegate for the Women's Strike for Peace Conference in Geneva, Switzerland.<ref>McCarty, p. xiii.</ref> Martin drove her to the hospital on March 28, 1963, where King gave birth to their fourth child [[Bernice King|Bernice.]] After King and her daughter were due to come home, Martin rushed back to drive them himself.<ref>McPherson, p. 56.</ref>\nAfter her husband's arrest on April 12, 1963, King tried to make direct contact with President Kennedy at the advisement of [[Wyatt Tee Walker]] and succeeded in speaking with Robert F. Kennedy. President Kennedy was with his father [[Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr]], who was not feeling well.<ref>Mahoney, p. 247</ref> In what has been noted as making Kennedy seem less sympathetic towards the Kings, the president redirected Mrs. King's call to the White House switchboard.<ref name=Branch736>Branch, p. 736.</ref>\n\nThe next day, President Kennedy reported to King that the FBI had been sent into Birmingham the previous night and confirmed that her husband was fine. He was allowed to speak with her on the phone and told her to inform Walker of Kennedy's involvement.<ref>Fairclough, p. 77.</ref> She told her husband of her assistance from the Kennedys, which her husband took as the reason \"why everybody is suddenly being so polite.\"<ref>Schlesinger, p. 328.</ref> Regarding the [[March on Washington]], Coretta said, \"It was as though heaven had come down.\"<ref>Willis, p. 166.</ref> Coretta had been home all day with their children, since the birth of their daughter Bernice had not allowed her to attend Easter Sunday church services.<ref>McPherson, p. 57.</ref> Since Mrs. King had issued her own statement regarding the aid of the president instead of doing as her husband had told her and report to [[Wyatt Walker]], this according to author [[Taylor Branch]], made her portrayed by reports as \"an anxious new mother who may have confused her White House fantasies with reality.\"<ref name=Branch736 />\n\nCoretta went to a Women Strike for Peace rally in New York, in the early days of November 1963. After speaking at the meeting held in the National Baptist Church, King joined the march from Central Park to the United Nations Headquarters. The march was timed to celebrate the group's second anniversary and celebrated the successful completion of the Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Coretta and Martin learned of [[John F. Kennedy assassination|John F. Kennedy's assassination]] when reports initially indicated he had only been seriously wounded. King joined her husband upstairs and watched [[Walter Cronkite]] announce the president's death.

In 1961, the office of the [[Postmaster-General's Department|Postmaster General]] (PMG) introduced the 000 number in major population centres and near the end of the 1980s extended its coverage to nationwide. The number 000 was chosen for several reasons: technically, it suited the dialling system for the most remote automatic exchanges, particularly outback Queensland. These communities used the digit 0 to select an automatic trunk line to a centre. In the most remote communities, two 0s had to be used to reach a main centre; thus dialling 0+0, plus another 0 would call (at least) an operator. Zero is also the closest to the finger stall on Australian rotary dial phones. This made it quick and easy to dial.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.acma.gov.au/WEB/STANDARD/pc=PC_100580 |title=History of the Emergency Call Services |website=ACMA |date=27 August 2007 |accessdate=19 November 2007 |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090515052220/http://www.acma.gov.au/WEB/STANDARD/pc=PC_100580 |archive-date=15 May 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> It is now well established nationally throughout Australia that persons requiring emergency assistance dial 000.\n\n== Calling 000 ==\nWithin Australia, 000 is a free call from most telephones. Dialling 000 (or 112) on most Australian GSM mobile phones will override any keypad lock, and if the caller's home network is out of range, the phone will attempt to use other carriers' networks to relay the call. A [[SIM card]] is not required to connect a mobile phone to Emergency Services. Interpreter services may be available once connected to Emergency Services.\n\nDue to special configuration in their firmware, some [[3G]] or [[GSM]] mobile phones sold in Australia will redirect other emergency numbers, such as [[9-1-1]] and [[999 (emergency telephone number)|9-9-9]], to 000. These calls are sent out by the handset as an emergency flag to the network and as such are treated in the same way as a call to 000.\n\n== Answering ==\nExcept for Victoria (see below), calling 000 greets the caller with a recorded message stating \"You have dialed emergency Triple Zero, your call is being connected\" then connects the caller to a [[Telstra]] operator who will then connect the caller to the emergency service organisation call taker. Telstra operators will ask the caller if they require \"Police, Fire, Ambulance?\", and their location if not calling from a phone with fixed location (landline). The caller is then connected to the emergency service requested by the caller.\n\nAs soon as the emergency service call taker answers the call, any available caller location information is transferred to the emergency service; however, the emergency service call taker will still question the caller to obtain correct location details in order to dispatch the correct response.\n\nThe caller's address is usually available to Telstra operators for fixed services in Australia even if the number is \"private\". However, emergency service organisation call takers will always ask for the address of the emergency to be stated whenever possible to ensure an accurate location is provided<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.esta.vic.gov.au/?id=71 |title=ESTA Frequently Asked Questions |website=Emergency Services Telecommunications Authority (Victoria) |accessdate=19 November 2007}}</ref> \u2013 this is especially relevant in the case of \"third-party\" callers who are not personally on the scene of the incident (e.g. relatives or alarm monitoring corporations). When calling from a telephone not at a fixed location (mobile), it is necessary for the caller to specify the location.\n\n=== Victoria ===\nIn the state of Victoria, answering 000 as well as emergency service dispatch and call taking for [[Victoria Police]], [[Ambulance Victoria]], the [[Country Fire Authority]] and the [[Metropolitan Fire Brigade (Melbourne)|Metropolitan Fire Brigade]], is handled by the Emergency Services Telecommunications Authority (ESTA).  ESTA operates three State Emergency Communications Centres, located in the [[Melbourne]] CBD, [[East Burwood]], and [[Ballarat]].\n\nWhen a person calls 000 for emergency response within Victoria, the call is automatically directed to the relevant ESTA facility where it will be answered by the next available trained call taker, who will collect information from the caller, and enter this into the [[Computer Aided Dispatch]] (CAD) system. Using this information, a dispatcher will identify and dispatch the appropriate emergency services or resources. Emergency crews are often already being notified by the relevant services' dispatchers while the call taker is still obtaining further information or giving advice, such as guiding the caller through [[Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation|CPR]], obtaining details of a possible offender, or receiving further details about the exact location or situation - an initial response may be made to details as vague as a town or suburb, while the call taker continues to get more specific location information.\n\nESTA is also responsible for Victorian [[State Emergency Service]] call-taking and dispatch, although this service cannot be contacted by dialling 000 as SES calls are not considered to be life-threatening. The number for SES calls is 132&nbsp;500, but police or another service dialled inappropriately will notify SES.\n\nMany ESTA practices and protocols are standardised across all emergency services agencies, and all agencies use the same computer network. The result is complete and instantaneous information sharing between emergency services.<ref>{{cite news | title=Centralised service for triple-0 calls |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-11-30/centralised-service-for-triple-zero-calls/4400394 |accessdate=1 December 2012 |website=[[ABC Online]] |date=30 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Issues ==\n\n=== 2009 Victorian bushfires ===\n\nOn 7 February 2009, catastrophic bushfires occurred in Victoria, otherwise known as [[Black Saturday bushfires]]. Over 18,000 calls to the Triple Zero Emergency Service on that day were left unanswered and the majority of calls took much longer to be answered than usual. Owing to the unprecedented numbers of calls coming through, Telstra decided to isolate all Victorian emergency calls which were answered by the Melbourne emergency call centre with all the remaining calls answered by the Sydney emergency call centre. Telstra also activated the generic extreme event recorded voice announcement ''\"You have dialled Emergency Triple Zero. If you require police, fire or ambulance please stay on the line. If you require your local State Emergency Service please hang up and dial 1223 \u2014 that\u2019s 1223 \u2014 as this service cannot be connected through Triple Zero\"'' which temporarily replaced their front end announcement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/96781/20100923-0223/www.royalcommission.vic.gov.au/Documents/PF-Chapters/Chapter12_PF.pdf |title=Emergency Calls |website=[[2009 Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission]] |accessdate=12 January 2014 |format=PDF |page=293}}</ref> While Telstra records show 95 emergency call centre employees rostered during the 24-hour period on 7 February 2009, call pick up delays were evident due to lengthy delays at the SECC level, being ESTA. Telstra agents were left tied up on phone calls with callers, waiting for emergency services to answer, thus calls in the 000 queue were unable to be answered. Callers in a queue waiting for a Telstra agent to answer the phone were played an RVA every 30 seconds in the following terms, \"You have dialled the Emergency Triple Zero number. Due to an unprecedented high volume of calls being received by Triple Zero, we are experiencing short delays in answering. Please stay on the line and you will be answered by the next available operator\". This reassures callers that an extreme emergency was occurring and their call would be answered.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dpc.vic.gov.au/index.php/component/content/article/22-html/867-2009-victorian-bushfires-royal-commission |title=Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission |website=Victoria Department of Premier and Cabinet|accessdate=21 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== 2003 overload in Melbourne ===\nOn 3 December 2003, floods and storms in [[Melbourne]] caused a large influx of 000 calls, which prevented some calls from being answered immediately. This caused some users interviewed by authorities to believe that they may have accidentally dialled the wrong number. A subsequent investigation recommended that a temporary recorded announcement be implemented during extreme events to assure callers that their calls were being connected and a delay may occur.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.royalcommission.vic.gov.au/Documents/Document-data/Exhibits/WIT-5003-001-0151 |title=Telstra's handling of calls to 000 on the morning of 3 December 2003 |website=[[Australian Communications and Media Authority|ACMA]] |accessdate=12 January 2014 |date=February 2004 |page=28}}</ref> This is not to be confused with the standard \"You have dialled Emergency Triple Zero, your call is being connected\" RVA, which was introduced in 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.royalcommission.vic.gov.au/Documents/PF-Chapters/Chapter12_PF.pdf |title=Emergency Calls |website=[[2009 Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission]] |accessdate=12 January 2014|format=PDF |page=288}}</ref>\n\n=== Nickname ===\nEmergency services and Australia's communications regulator prefer the phrase \"triple zero\" over \"triple oh\" because of potential confusion and misunderstanding over keying the number when using alpha-numeric keypads, on which the letter \"O\" is typically located on the same key as the number \"6\".\n\n=== Remote locations ===\nOne major obstacle in earlier 2009<ref name=overington2009>{{cite news |first=Caroline |last=Overington |author-link=Caroline Overington |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/biker-mates-rue-calling-triple-0/story-e6frg6no-1225703296424 |title=Biker mates rue calling Triple-0 |date=25 April 2009 |newspaper=[[The Australian]] |accessdate=7 July 2013}}</ref> is that operators of triple-0 could not use GPS within GSM or CDMA systems to accurately locate distressed or injured persons using mobile phones visibly away from roads. Presently, operators must ask the caller exactly where they are. The answer to this may need to correspond to an existing road name (which may be practically impossible for distressed person(s) some kilometres away from a road) until the Emergency Service Organisation operator can dispatch an emergency service vehicle.\n\nIn 2010, the [[Australian Communications and Media Authority]] (ACMA) began researching options that may provide improved location information for mobile services when dialing 000. \n\nIn 2013, an emergency service smartphone app was  produced and developed by [[Fire and Rescue NSW]] and the Triple Zero Awareness Working Group.<ref>https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.threesixtyentertainment.nesn</ref> Australians in remote locations are encouraged to use this app to contact emergency services as it uses phones GPS data to display the caller's location on the screen.

These calls are sent out by the handset as an emergency flag to the network and as such are treated in the same way as a call to 000.\n\n== Answering ==\nExcept for Victoria (see below), calling 000 greets the caller with a recorded message stating \"You have dialed emergency Triple Zero, your call is being connected\" then connects the caller to a [[Telstra]] operator who will then connect the caller to the emergency service organisation call taker. Telstra operators will ask the caller if they require \"Police, Fire, Ambulance?\", and their location if not calling from a phone with fixed location (landline). The caller is then connected to the emergency service requested by the caller.\n\nAs soon as the emergency service call taker answers the call, any available caller location information is transferred to the emergency service; however, the emergency service call taker will still question the caller to obtain correct location details in order to dispatch the correct response.\n\nThe caller's address is usually available to Telstra operators for fixed services in Australia even if the number is \"private\". However, emergency service organisation call takers will always ask for the address of the emergency to be stated whenever possible to ensure an accurate location is provided<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.esta.vic.gov.au/?id=71 |title=ESTA Frequently Asked Questions |website=Emergency Services Telecommunications Authority (Victoria) |accessdate=19 November 2007}}</ref> \u2013 this is especially relevant in the case of \"third-party\" callers who are not personally on the scene of the incident (e.g. relatives or alarm monitoring corporations). When calling from a telephone not at a fixed location (mobile), it is necessary for the caller to specify the location.\n\n=== Victoria ===\nIn the state of Victoria, answering 000 as well as emergency service dispatch and call taking for [[Victoria Police]], [[Ambulance Victoria]], the [[Country Fire Authority]] and the [[Metropolitan Fire Brigade (Melbourne)|Metropolitan Fire Brigade]], is handled by the Emergency Services Telecommunications Authority (ESTA).  ESTA operates three State Emergency Communications Centres, located in the [[Melbourne]] CBD, [[East Burwood]], and [[Ballarat]].\n\nWhen a person calls 000 for emergency response within Victoria, the call is automatically directed to the relevant ESTA facility where it will be answered by the next available trained call taker, who will collect information from the caller, and enter this into the [[Computer Aided Dispatch]] (CAD) system. Using this information, a dispatcher will identify and dispatch the appropriate emergency services or resources. Emergency crews are often already being notified by the relevant services' dispatchers while the call taker is still obtaining further information or giving advice, such as guiding the caller through [[Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation|CPR]], obtaining details of a possible offender, or receiving further details about the exact location or situation - an initial response may be made to details as vague as a town or suburb, while the call taker continues to get more specific location information.\n\nESTA is also responsible for Victorian [[State Emergency Service]] call-taking and dispatch, although this service cannot be contacted by dialling 000 as SES calls are not considered to be life-threatening. The number for SES calls is 132&nbsp;500, but police or another service dialled inappropriately will notify SES.\n\nMany ESTA practices and protocols are standardised across all emergency services agencies, and all agencies use the same computer network. The result is complete and instantaneous information sharing between emergency services.<ref>{{cite news | title=Centralised service for triple-0 calls |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-11-30/centralised-service-for-triple-zero-calls/4400394 |accessdate=1 December 2012 |website=[[ABC Online]] |date=30 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Issues ==\n\n=== 2009 Victorian bushfires ===\n\nOn 7 February 2009, catastrophic bushfires occurred in Victoria, otherwise known as [[Black Saturday bushfires]].

Owing to the unprecedented numbers of calls coming through, Telstra decided to isolate all Victorian emergency calls which were answered by the Melbourne emergency call centre with all the remaining calls answered by the Sydney emergency call centre. Telstra also activated the generic extreme event recorded voice announcement ''\"You have dialled Emergency Triple Zero. If you require police, fire or ambulance please stay on the line. If you require your local State Emergency Service please hang up and dial 1223 \u2014 that\u2019s 1223 \u2014 as this service cannot be connected through Triple Zero\"'' which temporarily replaced their front end announcement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/96781/20100923-0223/www.royalcommission.vic.gov.au/Documents/PF-Chapters/Chapter12_PF.pdf |title=Emergency Calls |website=[[2009 Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission]] |accessdate=12 January 2014 |format=PDF |page=293}}</ref> While Telstra records show 95 emergency call centre employees rostered during the 24-hour period on 7 February 2009, call pick up delays were evident due to lengthy delays at the SECC level, being ESTA.

The curd is then cut into roughly 1&nbsp;cm (1/2 inch) cubes, salted, and transferred to low cylindrical camembert molds.<ref name=smith /> The molds are turned every six to twelve hours to allow the [[whey]] to drain evenly from the cut curds; after 48 hours, each mold contains a flat, cylindrical, solid cheese mass weighing generally 250 grams (about 9 oz). At this point the fresh cheese is hard, crumbly, and bland.\n\nThe surface of each cheese is then sprayed with an aqueous suspension of the [[Mold (fungus)|mold]] ''[[Penicillium camemberti]]'', and the cheeses are left to ripen for a legally required minimum of three weeks. This [[affinage]] produces the distinctive [[bloomy rind|bloomy, edible rind]] and creamy interior texture characteristic of the cheese.<ref name=smith /> Once the cheeses are sufficiently ripe, they are wrapped in paper and may be placed in wooden boxes for transport.\n\n[[File:camembert.JPG|thumb|Camembert of [[Normandy]]]]\n\n== History ==\nCamembert was reputedly first made in 1791 by [[Marie Harel]], a farmer from [[Normandy]], following advice from a priest who came from [[Brie (region)|Brie]].<ref>[http://www.camembert-aoc.org/unil-uk/htm/historique-uk.htm The Invention of Marie Harel, ''Camembert de Normandie'' web site]</ref>\n\nHowever, the origin of the cheese known today as Camembert is more likely to rest with the beginnings of the industrialization of the cheesemaking process at the end of the 19th century.<ref>Pierre Boisard, ''Camembert: A National Myth'', 2003 ( {{ISBN|0-520-22550-3}} ) claims that Camembert was one of the first globalized, homogenized, and standardized foods.</ref> In 1890, an engineer, M. Ridel, devised the wooden box that was used to carry the cheese and helped to send it for longer distances, in particular to America, where it became very popular. These boxes are still used today.\n\nBefore [[fungi]] were understood, the color of Camembert [[:wikt:rind|rind]] was a matter of chance, most commonly blue-grey, with brown spots. From the early 20th century onwards, the rind has been more commonly pure white, but it was not until the mid-1970s that pure white became standard.\n\nThe cheese was famously issued to French troops during [[World War I]], becoming firmly fixed in French popular culture as a result. It has many other roles in French culture, literature, and history. It is now internationally known, and many local varieties are made around the world.\n\nThe variety named ''{{lang|fr|Camembert de Normandie}}'' was granted a [[protected designation of origin]] in 1992 after the original [[Appellation d'Origine Contr\u00f4l\u00e9e|AOC]] in 1983. The AOC Camembert can only be made from raw, unpasteurized milk from [[Normande|Normandes]] cows.

However, there are differences such as its origin, typical market shape, size, and flavor. Brie originates from the [[\u00cele de France]] while camembert comes from [[Normandy]]. Traditionally, brie was produced in large wheels, either {{convert|22.9|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} or {{convert|36.8|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter,<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.dairyfoodsconsulting.com/recipes_camembert.shtml |title = Dairy Foods Consulting & Westminster Artisan Cheesemaking |last = Dixon |first = Peter |accessdate = 25 July 2013 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131227173810/http://www.dairyfoodsconsulting.com/recipes_camembert.shtml |archivedate = 27 December 2013 }}</ref> and thus ripened more slowly than the smaller camembert cheeses. When sold, brie segments typically have been cut from the larger wheels (although some brie is sold as small, flat cylinders), and therefore its sides are not covered by the rind. By contrast, camembert is ripened as a small round cheese {{convert|10.2|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} in diameter by {{convert|3.2|cm|in|2|abbr=on}} thick and fully covered by rind.  This ratio change between rind and paste makes camembert slightly stronger when compared to a brie ripened for the same amount of time. Once the rind is cut on camembert it typically has a more pungent aroma than brie. In terms of taste, camembert has a stronger, slightly sour, and sometimes chalky taste. The texture of camembert is softer than brie, and if warmed camembert will become creamier, whereas brie warms without losing as much structure.\n\n== Packaging ==\n[[File:Cheese 17 bg 050606.jpg|thumb|right|Camembert cheese box]]\nTypically camembert tends to be sold whole in thin, round, wooden containers made from [[Populus|poplar]]. Modern variations in packaging include cartons and tin cans, with a ring-pull tab for opening (Camembert in  metallic boxes does not exist on the French market).

It was first made in the late 18th century at [[Camembert, Orne|Camembert]], [[Normandy]], in northern [[France]].  It is similar to [[Brie]], which is native to the [[Brie (region)|Brie region]] of France.\n\n== Production ==\nThe first camembert was made from [[raw milk|unpasteurized milk]], and the [[Appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e|AOC]] variety \"Camembert de Normandie\" (approximately 10% of the production) is required by law to be made only with unpasteurized milk. Many modern cheesemakers, however, use pasteurized milk for reasons of safety, compliance with regulations, or convenience.<ref name=smith>{{cite book | last = Smith | first = Tim | title = Making artisan cheese : 50 fine cheeses that you can make in your own kitchen | publisher = Quarry Books | location = Beverly, Massachusetts | year = 2005 | isbn =1-59253-197-0}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Emballage camembert de Normandie AOP Isigny Sainte-M\u00e8re.JPG|thumb|True {{ill|Camembert de Normandie|fr}} made with unpasteurized milk]]\nThe cheese is made by inoculating warmed cow milk with [[mesophilic]] bacteria, then adding [[rennet]] and allowing the mixture to coagulate. The curd is then cut into roughly 1&nbsp;cm (1/2 inch) cubes, salted, and transferred to low cylindrical camembert molds.<ref name=smith /> The molds are turned every six to twelve hours to allow the [[whey]] to drain evenly from the cut curds; after 48 hours, each mold contains a flat, cylindrical, solid cheese mass weighing generally 250 grams (about 9 oz). At this point the fresh cheese is hard, crumbly, and bland.\n\nThe surface of each cheese is then sprayed with an aqueous suspension of the [[mold]] ''[[Penicillium camemberti]]'', and the cheeses are left to ripen for a legally required minimum of three weeks. This [[affinage]] produces the distinctive [[bloomy rind|bloomy, edible rind]] and creamy interior texture characteristic of the cheese.<ref name=smith /> Once the cheeses are sufficiently ripe, they are wrapped in paper and may be placed in wooden boxes for transport.\n\n[[File:camembert.JPG|thumb|Camembert of [[Normandy]]]]\n\n== History ==\nCamembert was reputedly first made in 1791 by [[Marie Harel]], a farmer from [[Normandy]], following advice from a priest who came from [[Brie (region)|Brie]].<ref>[http://www.camembert-aoc.org/unil-uk/htm/historique-uk.htm The Invention of Marie Harel, ''Camembert de Normandie'' web site]</ref>\n\nHowever, the origin of the cheese known today as Camembert is more likely to rest with the beginnings of the industrialization of the cheesemaking process at the end of the 19th century.<ref>Pierre Boisard, ''Camembert: A National Myth'', 2003 ( {{ISBN|0-520-22550-3}} ) claims that Camembert was one of the first globalized, homogenized, and standardized foods.</ref> In 1890, an engineer, M. Ridel, devised the wooden box that was used to carry the cheese and helped to send it for longer distances, in particular to America, where it became very popular. These boxes are still used today.\n\nBefore [[fungi]] were understood, the color of Camembert [[:wikt:rind|rind]] was a matter of chance, most commonly blue-grey, with brown spots. From the early 20th century onwards, the rind has been more commonly pure white, but it was not until the mid-1970s that pure white became standard.\n\nThe cheese was famously issued to French troops during [[World War I]], becoming firmly fixed in French popular culture as a result. It has many other roles in French culture, literature, and history. It is now internationally known, and many local varieties are made around the world.\n\nThe variety named ''{{lang|fr|Camembert de Normandie}}'' was granted a [[protected designation of origin]] in 1992 after the original [[Appellation d'Origine Contr\u00f4l\u00e9e|AOC]] in 1983. The AOC Camembert can only be made from raw, unpasteurized milk from [[Normande|Normandes]] cows. Problems with hygiene regulations have caused restrictions on importation and sale in some countries, notably the US.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-13/camembert-cheese-might-be-going-extinct |title=One of the World's Great Cheeses Might Be Going Extinct |last=Zimberoff |first=Larissa |date=2017-06-13 |website=www.bloomberg.com |publisher= |access-date=2019-09-15 |quote=}}</ref>\n\n== Chemical composition ==\nCamembert cheese gets its characteristic odor from many compounds.  These include [[diacetyl]] (buttery flavoring for popcorn), [[3-methylbutanal]], [[methional]] (degradation product of [[methionine]]), [[1-octen-3-ol]] and [[1-octen-3-one]] (degradation products of fats), [[phenethyl acetate]], [[2-undecanone]], [[\u03b4-decalactone]], [[butyric acid]], and [[isovaleric acid]] (odor of gym socks).<ref>{{cite journal\n| first = J. | last = Kub\u00edckov\u00e1a |author2=W.

However, there are differences such as its origin, typical market shape, size, and flavor. Brie originates from the [[\u00cele de France]] while camembert comes from [[Normandy]]. Traditionally, brie was produced in large wheels, either {{convert|22.9|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} or {{convert|36.8|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter,<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.dairyfoodsconsulting.com/recipes_camembert.shtml |title = Dairy Foods Consulting & Westminster Artisan Cheesemaking |last = Dixon |first = Peter |accessdate = 25 July 2013 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131227173810/http://www.dairyfoodsconsulting.com/recipes_camembert.shtml |archivedate = 27 December 2013 }}</ref> and thus ripened more slowly than the smaller camembert cheeses. When sold, brie segments typically have been cut from the larger wheels (although some brie is sold as small, flat cylinders), and therefore its sides are not covered by the rind. By contrast, camembert is ripened as a small round cheese {{convert|10.2|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} in diameter by {{convert|3.2|cm|in|2|abbr=on}} thick and fully covered by rind.  This ratio change between rind and paste makes camembert slightly stronger when compared to a brie ripened for the same amount of time. Once the rind is cut on camembert it typically has a more pungent aroma than brie. In terms of taste, camembert has a stronger, slightly sour, and sometimes chalky taste. The texture of camembert is softer than brie, and if warmed camembert will become creamier, whereas brie warms without losing as much structure.\n\n== Packaging ==\n[[File:Cheese 17 bg 050606.jpg|thumb|right|Camembert cheese box]]\nTypically camembert tends to be sold whole in thin, round, wooden containers made from [[Populus|poplar]]. Modern variations in packaging include cartons and tin cans, with a ring-pull tab for opening (Camembert in  metallic boxes does not exist on the French market). The cardboard boxes are reserved for the low-cost camemberts. The product is the same as in the wooden container, wrapped dry in a paper/foil wrapper, and not immersed in brine or oil.<br />\n\n== Camembert from other countries==\nA similar cheese is produced in Hungary under the same name,<ref>{{cite web |title=Camembert in Hungary |url=http://www.chew.hu/camembert/ |website=Chew.hu |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140619181100/http://www.chew.hu/camembert/ |archivedate=2014-06-19 }}</ref> the Czech Republic under the name ''{{lang|hu|[[Hermel\u00edn]]}}'' and in Slovakia as ''{{lang|sk|enci\u00e1n}}'' or ''{{lang|sk|plesnivec}}''.

{"title_page": "Area (LDS Church)", "text_new": "In [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), an '''area''' is an administrative unit which typically is composed of multiple [[Stake (Latter Day Saints)|stakes]] and [[Mission (LDS Church)|missions]]. These areas are the primary church administrative unit between individual stakes or missions and the church as a whole.\n\n==History==\nThe areas as they now exist were formed in January 1984.<ref>[[James B. Allen (historian)|Allen, James B.]] and [[Glen M. Leonard]]. ''[[The Story of the Latter-day Saints]]'' 2nd Edition, p. 654.</ref> Prior to that time, [[general authorities]] served as \"area supervisors\" and at times resided outside of [[Salt Lake City]].<ref>{{cite journal | last = Mehr | first = Kahlile | title = Area Supervision: Administration of the Worldwide Church, 1960-2002 | journal = [[Journal of Mormon History]] | date = Spring 2001 | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | pages = 192\u2013214 | url = http://content.lib.utah.edu/u?/jmh,17512}}</ref> In 1984, 13 initial areas were created; by 1992 there were 22, and by early 2007 there were 31. As of August 2019 there are 21 areas.\n\n===Future area division===\nOn June 28, 2019, the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] announced a future area division which will go into effect in August 2020, when the nations comprising the current Africa Southeast Area will be split between the new Africa Central Area and the renamed Africa South Area.<ref>[https://www.mormonnewsroom.co.za/article/africa-southeast-area-to-be-divided-into-two-areas Africa Southeast Area to be Divided into Two Areas], ''South African Newsroom'', 28 June 2019. Retrieved 30 July 2019.</ref>  \n\nOn August 19, 2019, while on assignment in the Africa Southeast Area, W. Christopher Waddell, Second Counselor in the [[Presiding Bishop (LDS Church)|Presiding Bishopric]], announced that the headquarters for the new Africa Central Area will be based in Nairobi Kenya, and identified by name the nations that will constitute the new area in August 2020.<ref>[https://www.mormonnewsroom.co.za/article/africa-central-area-office-to-be-in-nairobi--kenya Africa Central Area Office to be in Nairobi Kenya], ''South African Newsroom'', 19 August 2019. Retrieved 19 August 2019.</ref> As a result of the planned area division, effective August 2020, there will be 22 geographical areas of the church.\n\n==Administration==\nUntil 2003, each area had a president and two counselors, all of whom were typically [[general authorities]] ([[area seventy|area seventies]] were sometimes asked to be counselors). This three-man body was known as the ''area presidency''.  In that year, the church eliminated area presidencies for areas located in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], which were all then placed under the direct supervision of one of the members of the [[Seventy (LDS Church)#Presidency of the Seventy|Presidency of the Seventy]], thus freeing more general authorities from specific area assignments. Since these areas were previously administered by area presidencies located at church headquarters in [[Salt Lake City]], the administrative change was not as drastic as it might seem.\n\nIn April 2018, the church announced that, effective August 1, areas in the United States and Canada would once again be supervised by a three-man presidency.  This will enable members of the Presidency of the Seventy to more fully assist the members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in their duties, and to fill other assignments as needed.<ref>[https://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/2018-area-presidency-assignments First Presidency Announces 2018 Area Leadership Assignments], ''Mormon Newsroom'', 5 April 2018. Retrieved 8 April 2018.</ref> \n\nRoughly one year later, in 2019, church leaders clarified that the 10 North American areas would be merged into 6 (with the Idaho and North America Central areas being consolidated into the North America Central, the North America Northwest, and North America West areas being consolidated into the North America West Area, and the Utah North, Utah Salt Lake City, and Utah South areas being consolidated into a single Utah Area.<ref name=\"Aug 2019 changes\" >[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/church/news/first-presidency-announces-2019-area-leadership-assignments?lang=eng&_r=1 First Presidency Announces 2019 Area Leadership Assignments], churchofjesuschrist.org, 26 April 2019. Retrieved 5 May 2019.</ref> \n\nAlso unique to the 2019 assignments was a change in the administration of the Middle East/Africa North Area. In prior years, two General Authority Seventies were assigned oversight for that area, which was administered from headquarters. However, beginning in August 2019, a three-man area presidency will serve the needs of that area. While the president and first counselor are General Authority Seventies who will continue their oversight from headquarters, the second counselor, an area seventy who lives and works within the boundaries of the area, will continue to do so and serve as a member of the area presidency. \n\nThe areas outside the United States and Canada continue to be governed by area presidencies that are typically composed of general authorities and area seventies. Rather than living in Salt Lake City, the area presidency members in these areas usually reside in a headquarters city that is located within the geographic boundaries of the area. Area seventies who serve in the area presidencies reside in their own homes, which may or may not be in the area headquarters city. \n\nThe church now has 15 areas outside North America and 6 areas inside North America for a total of 21. Area presidency assignments are generally filled by General Authority Seventies or area seventies.<ref>Although area seventies may serve in an area presidency.  In limited cases in the past, area seventies have comprised the whole presidency, but in recent years only a few area seventies have served in an area presidency. As of August 2019, the church has two area seventies serving in area presidencies: the Second Counselors in the Europe East and Middle East/Africa North Areas.</ref>Area assignments are typically announced in the spring each year, with changes effective that year on August 1.<ref>For several years, the assignments were effective on August 15, but August 1 has been the effective date since 2007.</ref>\n\n==List==\nThe following is an alphabetical list of the areas of the church and related leadership assignments as of 1 August 2019.<ref name=\"Aug 2019 changes\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- \n!

typically is composed of multiple [[Stake (Latter Day Saints)|stakes]] and [[Mission (LDS Church)|missions]]. These areas are the primary church administrative unit between individual stakes or missions and the church as a whole.\n\n==History==\nThe areas as they now exist were formed in January 1984.<ref>[[James B.

As of August 2019 there are 21 areas.\n\n===Future area division===\nOn June 28, 2019, the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] announced a future area division which will go into effect in August 2020, when the nations comprising the current Africa Southeast Area will be split between the new Africa Central Area and the renamed Africa South Area.<ref>[https://www.mormonnewsroom.co.za/article/africa-southeast-area-to-be-divided-into-two-areas Africa Southeast Area to be Divided into Two Areas], ''South African Newsroom'', 28 June 2019. Retrieved 30 July 2019.</ref>  \n\nOn August 19, 2019, while on assignment in the Africa Southeast Area, W. Christopher Waddell, Second Counselor in the [[Presiding Bishop (LDS Church)|Presiding Bishopric]], announced that the headquarters for the new Africa Central Area will be based in Nairobi Kenya, and identified by name the nations that will constitute the new area in August 2020.<ref>[https://www.mormonnewsroom.co.za/article/africa-central-area-office-to-be-in-nairobi--kenya Africa Central Area Office to be in Nairobi Kenya], ''South African Newsroom'', 19 August 2019. Retrieved 19 August 2019.</ref> As a result of the planned area division, effective August 2020, there will be 22 geographical areas of the church.\n\n==Administration==\nUntil 2003, each area had a president and two counselors, all of whom were typically [[general authorities]] ([[area seventy|area seventies]] were sometimes asked to be counselors). This three-man body was known as the ''area presidency''.  In that year, the church eliminated area presidencies for areas located in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], which were all then placed under the direct supervision of one of the members of the [[Seventy (LDS Church)#Presidency of the Seventy|Presidency of the Seventy]], thus freeing more general authorities from specific area assignments. Since these areas were previously administered by area presidencies located at church headquarters in [[Salt Lake City]], the administrative change was not as drastic as it might seem.\n\nIn April 2018, the church announced that, effective August 1, areas in the United States and Canada would once again be supervised by a three-man presidency.  This will enable members of the Presidency of the Seventy to more fully assist the members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in their duties, and to fill other assignments as needed.<ref>[https://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/2018-area-presidency-assignments First Presidency Announces 2018 Area Leadership Assignments], ''Mormon Newsroom'', 5 April 2018. Retrieved 8 April 2018.</ref> \n\nRoughly one year later, in 2019, church leaders clarified that the 10 North American areas would be merged into 6 (with the Idaho and North America Central areas being consolidated into the North America Central, the North America Northwest, and North America West areas being consolidated into the North America West Area, and the Utah North, Utah Salt Lake City, and Utah South areas being consolidated into a single Utah Area.<ref name=\"Aug 2019 changes\" >[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/church/news/first-presidency-announces-2019-area-leadership-assignments?lang=eng&_r=1 First Presidency Announces 2019 Area Leadership Assignments], churchofjesuschrist.org, 26 April 2019. Retrieved 5 May 2019.</ref> \n\nAlso unique to the 2019 assignments was a change in the administration of the Middle East/Africa North Area. In prior years, two General Authority Seventies were assigned oversight for that area, which was administered from headquarters. However, beginning in August 2019, a three-man area presidency will serve the needs of that area. While the president and first counselor are General Authority Seventies who will continue their oversight from headquarters, the second counselor, an area seventy who lives and works within the boundaries of the area, will continue to do so and serve as a member of the area presidency. \n\nThe areas outside the United States and Canada continue to be governed by area presidencies that are typically composed of general authorities and area seventies. Rather than living in Salt Lake City, the area presidency members in these areas usually reside in a headquarters city that is located within the geographic boundaries of the area. Area seventies who serve in the area presidencies reside in their own homes, which may or may not be in the area headquarters city. \n\nThe church now has 15 areas outside North America and 6 areas inside North America for a total of 21. Area presidency assignments are generally filled by General Authority Seventies or area seventies.<ref>Although area seventies may serve in an area presidency.  In limited cases in the past, area seventies have comprised the whole presidency, but in recent years only a few area seventies have served in an area presidency. As of August 2019, the church has two area seventies serving in area presidencies: the Second Counselors in the Europe East and Middle East/Africa North Areas.</ref>Area assignments are typically announced in the spring each year, with changes effective that year on August 1.<ref>For several years, the assignments were effective on August 15, but August 1 has been the effective date since 2007.</ref>\n\n==List==\nThe following is an alphabetical list of the areas of the church and related leadership assignments as of 1 August 2019.<ref name=\"Aug 2019 changes\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- \n!
