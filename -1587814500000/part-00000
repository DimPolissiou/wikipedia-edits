The novella ''A Separate War'' (1999) is another sequel of sorts, occurring simultaneously with the final portion of ''The Forever War''. Informally, the novels comprise [[The Forever War series]]; the novel also inspired a [[The Forever War (comics)|comic book]] and a board game.<ref>[http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/5043 Forever War, the (1983)] (database entry from the [[BoardGameGeek]] website).</ref> ''The Forever War'' is the first title in the [[SF Masterworks]] series.\n\n==Plot summary==\n\n[[William Mandella]] is a physics student conscripted for an elite task force in the United Nations Exploratory Force being assembled for a war against the Taurans, an alien species discovered when they apparently attacked human colonists' ships. The UNEF ground troops are sent out for reconnaissance and revenge.\n\nThe elite recruits have [[IQ]]s of 150 and above, are highly educated, healthy, and fit. Training is grueling{{spaced ndash}}first on Earth and later on a planet called \"Charon\" beyond [[Pluto]] (written before the discovery of the [[Charon (moon)|actual planetoid]]). Several of the recruits die during training due to the extreme environments and the use of live weapons. The new soldiers complete training and immediately depart for action via interconnected \"collapsars\" that allow ships to cover thousands of [[light-year]]s in a split second. Traveling to collapsars at near-[[Speed of light|lightspeed]] has enormous [[Special Relativity|relativistic]] time effects.\n\nTheir first encounter with Taurans, on a planet orbiting [[Epsilon Aurigae]], triggers their [[Post-hypnotic suggestion|post-hypnotic training]], which causes them to massacre the Taurans despite of their lack of resistance. This first expedition, beginning in 1997, lasts only two years from the soldiers' point of view, but due to [[time dilation]], they return to Earth in 2024.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/features/la-bkw-park30dec30,0,574794.story|title=Leaping forward|last=Park|first=Ed|date=30 December 2007|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=10 January 2010}}</ref> During the expedition's second battle, the soldiers experience future shock first-hand, as the Taurans have much more advanced weaponry.\n\nMandella, with fellow soldier and lover Marygay Potter, returns to civilian life, only to find humanity drastically changed. He and the other discharged soldiers have difficulty fitting into a society that has altered almost beyond their comprehension. The veterans learn that, to curb overpopulation, which led to worldwide class wars caused by inequitable rationing, homosexuality has become officially encouraged by many of the world's nations. The world has become a very dangerous place due to widespread unemployment and the easy availability of deadly weapons. Alienated, Mandella and many other veterans re-enlist, despite the extremely high casualty rate and their recognition that the military is a soulless construct. Mandella and Potter receive promised postings as instructors on [[Moon|Luna]], but upon arrival are immediately reassigned to a combat command.\n\nAlmost entirely through luck, Mandella survives four years of military service, while several centuries elapse in real time. He soon becomes the objectively oldest surviving soldier in the war, attaining high rank through seniority rather than ambition. He and Potter (who has remained his last link with the Earth of his youth) are eventually given different assignments, meaning that even if they both survive the war they will likely never meet again due to time dilation. After briefly contemplating suicide, Mandella assumes the post of commanding officer of a \"strike force\", commanding soldiers who speak a language largely unrecognizable to him, whose ethnicity is now nearly uniform ('vaguely [[Polynesians|Polynesian]]' in appearance) and who are exclusively homosexual. He is disliked by his soldiers because they have to learn 21st century English to communicate with him and other senior staff and because he is heterosexual.\n\nEngaging in combat thousands of light years away from Earth, Mandella and his soldiers need to resort to medieval weapons to fight inside a [[Stasis (fiction)|stasis field]] which neutralizes all electromagnetic radiation in anything not covered with a protective coating. Upon return, the strike force learns this is the last battle of the war. Humanity has begun to clone itself, resulting in a new, collective species calling itself simply ''Man''. ''Man'' is able to communicate with the Taurans, who are also clones. It is discovered that the war started due to a misunderstanding; the colony ships were lost to accidents and those on Earth with a vested interest in a new war used these disappearances as an excuse to begin the conflict. The futile, meaningless war, which had lasted for more than a thousand years, ends.\n\n''Man'' has established several colonies of old-style, heterosexual humans, just in case the evolutionary change proves to be a mistake. Mandella travels to one of these colonies (named \"Middle Finger\" in the definitive version of the novel) where he is reunited with Marygay, who had been discharged much earlier and had taken trips in space to use time dilation to age at a much slower rate, hoping for Mandella's return. The epilogue is a news item from the year 3143 announcing the birth of a \"fine baby boy\" to Marygay Potter-Mandella.\n\n==Reception and interpretation==\nThe novel is widely perceived to be a portrayal of the author's military service during the [[Vietnam War]], and has been called an account of his war experiences written through a [[space opera]] filter.<ref name=\"MIT\">[http://web.mit.edu/m-I-t/science_fiction/profiles/haldeman_index.html Joe Haldeman] (author profile at the 'media in transition' project of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]])</ref> Other hints of the autobiographical nature of the work are the protagonist's surname, Mandella, which is a near-[[anagram]] of the author's surname; Mandella being a physics student, like Haldeman, as well as the name of the lead female character, Marygay Potter, which is nearly identical to Haldeman's wife's maiden name. If one accepts this reading of the book, the alienation experienced by the soldiers on returning to Earth{{spaced ndash}}here caused by the time dilation effect{{spaced ndash}}becomes a clear metaphor for the reception given to US troops returning to America from Vietnam, including the way in which the war ultimately proves useless and its result meaningless. He also subverts typical space opera clich\u00e9s (such as the heroic soldier influencing battles through individual acts) and \"demonstrates how absurd many of the old clich\u00e9s look to someone who had seen real combat duty\".<ref name=\"MIT\"/>\n\n''The Forever War'' is popularly thought to be a direct reply to Hugo award-winning future war novel ''[[Starship Troopers]]'' by [[Robert Heinlein]].  While Haldeman has stated that ''The Forever War'' is actually a result of his experiences in the [[Vietnam War]], he has admitted to being influenced by Heinlein's work.<ref name=Haldeman/><ref name=\"WWE-1976\"/><ref name=\"WWE-1975\"/> Haldeman said that he disagreed with ''Starship Troopers'' because it \"glorifies war\" but added that \"it's a very well-crafted novel and I believe Heinlein was honest with it\".<ref name=\"Haldeman\">{{cite web|last=Haldeman| first=Joe| url=http://www.scifi.com/transcripts/1998/JoeHaldeman.html| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060315063638/http://www.scifi.com/transcripts/1998/JoeHaldeman.html| archivedate=March 15, 2006| title= 1998 SciFi.com interview| year=1998| accessdate=March 4, 2006}}</ref> ''The Forever War'' contains several parallels to ''Starship Troopers'', including its setting and the powered armor that Heinlein's novel first popularized. Commentators have described it as a reaction to Heinlein's novel, a suggestion Haldeman denies; the two novels are very different in terms of their attitude towards the military. ''The Forever War'' does not depict war as a noble pursuit, with the sides clearly defined as good and evil; instead, the novel explores the dehumanizing effect of war, influenced by the real world context of the Vietnam War.<ref name=JH>{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=Joan|title=Joe Haldeman|publisher=Wildside Press LLC|page=33 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T8xA-sA5z80C|isbn=9780916732066|location=[[Rockville, Maryland]], US|year=1980}}</ref>\n\nHeinlein wrote a letter to Haldeman, congratulating Haldeman on his Nebula Award; Haldeman has said that Heinlein's letter \"meant more than the award itself\".<ref>Requiem,  Yoji Kondo, editor, p. 274</ref> According to author [[Spider Robinson]], Heinlein approached Haldeman at the awards banquet and said the book \"may be the best future war story I've ever read!\"<ref>Requiem,  Yoji Kondo, editor, p. 315</ref>\n\n==Editions==\n''The Forever War'' was originally written as Haldeman's MFA thesis for the [[Iowa Writer's Workshop]]. It was first published as a serial in ''[[Analog Magazine]]'' before its first book publication in 1974. Since then, many editions of ''The Forever War'' have been published. Editions published prior to 1991 were abridged for space by the original editor (omitting the middle section, a novella titled ''You Can Never Go Back''). These early paperback editions have \"a white cover showing a man in a spacesuit with a sword, with symbolic clocks all around,\" according to the author, with alternatively the first hardcover edition featuring a large hourglass with planets falling through it.\n\nThe 1991 edition restored many expurgated sections, primarily dealing with the changes that befall human civilization over the course of William Mandella's life. This version's cover \"has a futuristic soldier who looks like [[Robin Williams]] in a funny hat,\" as Haldeman notes, \"But alas, not all of the changes got in, and the book has some internal contradictions because of things left over from the [earlier version].\"\n\nIn 1997, [[Avon (publisher)|Avon]] published the version that Haldeman called \"definitive\", with \"everything restored\" and \"a less funny cover illustration.\"<ref>{{cite book |last= Haldeman |first=Joe |title=The Forever War |publisher= [[Avon (publishers)|Avon]] |year= 1997 |origyear=1974}}</ref> This version was republished twice, first in October 2001 as a hardback with a cover showing spaceships in battle over a planet, and again in September 2003, with the cover art depicting a device worn over the eye of a soldier.\n\nIn 1999, it was republished by Millennium, an imprint of the [[Orion Publishing Group]], as part of the [[SF Masterworks]] series. It featured as the first novel re-printed in the series, and the cover shows a close-up of Marygay Potter with soldiers and spaceships in the background. This is the same version as the 1997 Avon publication and has the same Author's Note.\n\nIn 1999, Haldeman, at the request of [[Robert Silverberg]], wrote Marygay's first-person account of her time of separation from Mandella. It included not only the military details but also the difficulty of coping as a lone heterosexual woman with a society where same-sex relations are the inflexible norm. The story was included in Silverberg's anthology ''[[Far Horizons]]'' (1999), and later was the title story in the collection of Haldeman stories ''A Separate War and Other Stories'' (2006). In his \"Notes on the Stories\" for that collection, Haldeman commented that \"it was fun to write her story, both as a bridge to the sequel ([[Forever Free (novel)|''Forever Free'']]) and as an oblique commentary on ''The Forever War'', twenty years later.\"\n\nIn 2006, an omnibus edition containing the books ''Forever War'', ''Forever Free'', and ''Forever Peace'' (under the title \"Peace and War\") was published by [[Victor Gollancz Ltd|Gollancz]]. The cover depicts a futuristic gun barrel stuck into the ground with a smashed spacesuit helmet placed on top. The author's note at the start of the book describes the edition as containing the definitive versions.\n\nThe most recent print edition was released in 2009 with an additional foreword by [[John Scalzi]]. The cover art depicts a soldier in a spacesuit in a jungle environment.\n\nAn ebook version was released in July 2011 by Ridan Publishing and also contained the foreword by [[John Scalzi]] and introductions by Haldeman and Robin Sullivan (President of Ridan Publishing). The cover art depicts a soldier in a war torn setting looking down at the helmet of a fallen comrade.\n\n==Adaptations==\n\n===Stage play===\n[[Stuart Gordon]] adapted the novel for Chicago's [[Organic Theater Company]] in 1983, in part as a reaction to what Gordon considered the \"ultra-sanitized video game\" style ''Star Wars'' brought to science fiction.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://artsinstitute.wisc.edu/iarp/stuart_gordon.html|title=Stuart Gordon: Artist in Residence|author=Christopher Sieving}}</ref> The play starred [[Bruce A.

With some very minor changes and omissions to storyline and setting, it faithfully adapts the same themes in visual style.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} The series was translated into various languages, and had a follow-up trilogy connected to ''[[Forever Free (novel)|Forever Free]]''.\n\n===Film===\nIn 1988, Richard Edlund (won Visual Effects Oscars for Star Wars, Empire, Raiders, Jedi) began to option the rights to the Forever War. In October 1994, he bought the rights to the property.

This version's cover \"has a futuristic soldier who looks like [[Robin Williams]] in a funny hat,\" as Haldeman notes, \"But alas, not all of the changes got in, and the book has some internal contradictions because of things left over from the [earlier version].\"\n\nIn 1997, [[Avon (publisher)|Avon]] published the version that Haldeman called \"definitive\", with \"everything restored\" and \"a less funny cover illustration.\"<ref>{{cite book |last= Haldeman |first=Joe |title=The Forever War |publisher= [[Avon (publishers)|Avon]] |year= 1997 |origyear=1974}}</ref> This version was republished twice, first in October 2001 as a hardback with a cover showing spaceships in battle over a planet, and again in September 2003, with the cover art depicting a device worn over the eye of a soldier.\n\nIn 1999, it was republished by Millennium, an imprint of the [[Orion Publishing Group]], as part of the [[SF Masterworks]] series. It featured as the first novel re-printed in the series, and the cover shows a close-up of Marygay Potter with soldiers and spaceships in the background. This is the same version as the 1997 Avon publication and has the same Author's Note.\n\nIn 1999, Haldeman, at the request of [[Robert Silverberg]], wrote Marygay's first-person account of her time of separation from Mandella. It included not only the military details but also the difficulty of coping as a lone heterosexual woman with a society where same-sex relations are the inflexible norm. The story was included in Silverberg's anthology ''[[Far Horizons]]'' (1999), and later was the title story in the collection of Haldeman stories ''A Separate War and Other Stories'' (2006). In his \"Notes on the Stories\" for that collection, Haldeman commented that \"it was fun to write her story, both as a bridge to the sequel ([[Forever Free (novel)|''Forever Free'']]) and as an oblique commentary on ''The Forever War'', twenty years later.\"\n\nIn 2006, an omnibus edition containing the books ''Forever War'', ''Forever Free'', and ''Forever Peace'' (under the title \"Peace and War\") was published by [[Victor Gollancz Ltd|Gollancz]]. The cover depicts a futuristic gun barrel stuck into the ground with a smashed spacesuit helmet placed on top. The author's note at the start of the book describes the edition as containing the definitive versions.\n\nThe most recent print edition was released in 2009 with an additional foreword by [[John Scalzi]]. The cover art depicts a soldier in a spacesuit in a jungle environment.\n\nAn ebook version was released in July 2011 by Ridan Publishing and also contained the foreword by [[John Scalzi]] and introductions by Haldeman and Robin Sullivan (President of Ridan Publishing). The cover art depicts a soldier in a war torn setting looking down at the helmet of a fallen comrade.\n\n==Adaptations==\n\n===Stage play===\n[[Stuart Gordon]] adapted the novel for Chicago's [[Organic Theater Company]] in 1983, in part as a reaction to what Gordon considered the \"ultra-sanitized video game\" style ''Star Wars'' brought to science fiction.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://artsinstitute.wisc.edu/iarp/stuart_gordon.html|title=Stuart Gordon: Artist in Residence|author=Christopher Sieving}}</ref> The play starred [[Bruce A. Young]] as William Mandella.\n\n===Game===\n[[Mayfair Games]] published a [[The Forever War (board game)|board game]] based on the novel in 1983.\n\n===Graphic novel===\n{{Main|The Forever War (comics)}}\nBelgian comic writer [[Marvano]] has, in cooperation with Haldeman, created a [[graphic novel]] trilogy of ''The Forever War''. With some very minor changes and omissions to storyline and setting, it faithfully adapts the same themes in visual style.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} The series was translated into various languages, and had a follow-up trilogy connected to ''[[Forever Free (novel)|Forever Free]]''.\n\n===Film===\nIn 1988, Richard Edlund (won Visual Effects Oscars for Star Wars, Empire, Raiders, Jedi) began to option the rights to the Forever War. In October 1994, he bought the rights to the property. In 2008 he optioned the rights to [[Ridley Scott]] who announced that, after a 25-year wait for the rights to become available, he was making a return to science fiction with a film adaptation of ''The Forever War''.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/oct/13/ridley-scott-forever-war | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Ridley Scott puts off Brave New World for The Forever War | first=Ben | last=Child | date=2008-10-13 | accessdate=2010-05-25}}</ref> In March 2009, Scott stated that the film would be in 3D, citing [[James Cameron]]'s ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' as an inspiration for doing so.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.firstshowing.net/2009/03/26/ridley-scott-says-cameron-inspired-him-to-make-forever-war-in-3d|title=Ridley Scott Says Cameron Inspired Him to Make Forever War in 3D|author=Alex Billington}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://io9.com/5187373/james-camerons-avatar-influences-ridley-scotts-forever-war|title=James Cameron's Avatar Influences Ridley Scott's Forever War|author=Charlie Jane Anders}}</ref> In the summer of 2010, Scott revealed that ''[[State of Play (film)|State of Play]]'' writer [[Matthew Michael Carnahan]] was currently on the fourth draft of a screenplay originally written by [[David Peoples]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.deadline.com/2010/08/tony-scott-has-to-choose-between-pic-trio/#more-59803|title=Tony Scott Has To Choose Among Pic Trio|author=Mike Fleming|date=2010-08-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://blastr.com/2010/06/those-two-alien-prequels.php|title=Those two Alien prequels?
