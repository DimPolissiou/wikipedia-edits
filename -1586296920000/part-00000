It centres on, in the words of critic [[J. Hillis Miller]], quoting from the character Bella Wilfer in the book, \"money, money, money, and what money can make of life\".<ref>Joseph Hillis Miller, ''Victorian Subjects''. Duke University Press, 1991, p. 69.</ref>\n\nMost reviewers in the 1860s continued to praise Dickens' skill as a writer in general, although not reviewing this novel in detail. Some found the plot both too complex and not laid out well.<ref name=\"New Books 1865\"/> ''The Times'' of London found the first few chapters did not draw the reader into the characters. In the 20th century, however, reviewers began to find much to approve in the later novels of Dickens, including ''Our Mutual Friend''.<ref name=Wilson2007 /> In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, some reviewers suggested that Dickens was, in fact, experimenting with structure,<ref name=Reed200615 /><ref name=Hecimovich1995 /> and that the characters considered somewhat flat and not recognized by the contemporary reviewers<ref name=Nelson1970 /> were meant rather to be true representations of the Victorian working class and the key to understanding the structure of the society depicted by Dickens in the novel.<ref name=Nelson1970 /><ref name=Hecimovich966 />\n\n==Characters==\n===Major characters===<!-- redirects anchor here -->\n* '''John Harmon''' \u2013 is heir to the Harmon estate, under the condition that he marry Bella Wilfer. He is presumed dead throughout most of the novel, though he is living under the name '''John Rokesmith''', and working as a secretary for the Boffins in an attempt to better get to know Bella, the Boffins, and people's general reaction to John Harmon's \"death\". Harmon also uses the alias '''Julius Handford''' upon first returning to London. Harmon's \"death\" and subsequent resurrection as Rokesmith/Handford is consistent with Dickens's recurring theme in the novel of rebirth from the water.<ref name=\"Thurley, Geoffrey 1976\">{{cite book |last=Thurley |first=Geoffrey |title=The Dickens Myth: Its Genesis and Structure |url=https://archive.org/details/dickensmythitsge0000thur |url-access=registration |location=London |publisher=Routledge and Kegan Paul |year=1976 |isbn=9780710084224}}</ref> His upward social mobility through his own efforts is presented as favourable, in contrast with Headstone, Hexam, and the Lammles.<ref name=Ihara1998 />\n* '''Bella Wilfer''' \u2013 is a beautiful girl born into poverty, who learns upon the death of Old Mr Harmon that she is the intended wife for his son, a condition of his inheritance. When her intended husband, John Harmon, is reported to have been killed, she is left without future prospects. She learns of the trouble money can bring when taken in by the newly-rich Boffins. Bella rejects Rokesmith's proposal at first but later accepts it. Initially described as a \"mercenary young woman\",<ref name=Dickens1989ed>{{cite book |last=Dickens |first=Charles |title=Our Mutual Friend |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1989 |isbn=978-0192817952}}</ref> who describes herself upon meeting Lizzie Hexam as having \"no more character than a canary bird\",<ref name=Dickens1989ed /> Bella undergoes a significant moral change in the novel. Although originally completely preoccupied with money, her complexity is eventually displayed in her ability to defy the societal pressures to achieve happiness unrelated to wealth. She is praised for her \"vivacity and lifelikeness\",<ref name=\"Romano, John 1978\">{{cite book |last=Romano |first=John |title=Dickens and Reality |location=New York |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=1978 |isbn=9780231042468 |url=https://archive.org/details/dickensreality0000roma }}</ref> with greater complexity than some of the other, more static characters. Her relationship with her father is more like that of a mother and son, as she consistently dotes upon him, calling him her \"cherub\".<ref name=Dickens1989ed /> She has an open and warm relationship with her father, which provides a stark contrast to the strained and resentful relationships between Bella and her mother and sister.\n* '''Nicodemus (Noddy) Boffin''',  '''the Golden [[Dustman]]''' \u2013 becomes a member of the ''[[nouveaux riches]]'' when Old Mr Harmon's heir is considered dead. He is illiterate, but wants to fit the image of a wealthy man, and so hires Silas Wegg to read to him in hopes of gaining more intelligence and worldliness. He is nearly blackmailed by Wegg. He assumes the role of a miser to show Bella the dangers of wealth, but eventually admits this behaviour was an act and gives his money to Bella and John. Boffin's innocence, na\u00efve curiosity, and desire to learn in his new position in life contrast with his \"elaborate performances as Boffin the miser\".<ref name=\"Romano, John 1978\"/> Critics speculate that Dickens's decision to have Boffin playing a part may not have been planned, as it was not very convincing for a man who has shown his simplistic ignorance on several occasions.<ref name=\"Hawes, Donald 1998\">{{cite book |last=Hawes |first=Donald |title=Who's Who in Dickens |location=London |publisher=Routledge |year=1998 |isbn=9780415260299}}</ref> Boffin's inheritance of Old Harmon's money is appropriate because Harmon had attained it by combing the dust heaps, because this suggests social mobility. Boffin represents a wholesome contrast to such wealthy characters as the Veneerings and Podsnaps, and may have been based on [[Henry Dodd]], a ploughboy who made his fortune removing London's rubbish.\n* '''Mrs Henrietta Boffin''' \u2013 is Noddy Boffin's wife, and a very motherly woman, who convinces Mr Boffin to take in an orphan boy called Johnny. This indicates \"another progressive development for Dickens as his female characters undertake a more active role in social reform\".<ref name=Swifte1999>{{cite web |url=http://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/2123/409/2/adt-NU2000.0013main.pdf |last=Swifte |first=Yasmin |title=Charles Dickens and the Role of Legal Institutions in Moral and Social Reform: ''Oliver Twist, Bleak House'' and ''Our Mutual Friend'' |publisher=University of Sydney Masters Thesis |accessdate=16 April 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219063234/http://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/2123/409/2/adt-NU2000.0013main.pdf |archive-date=19 February 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> \n* '''Lizzie Hexam''' \u2013 is a daughter of Gaffer Hexam and sister of Charley Hexam. She is an affectionate daughter, but knows that Charley must escape their living circumstances if he is to succeed in life, so she gives Charley her money and helps him leave while their father is away. Later she is rejected by Charley after she remains in poverty. Pursued romantically by both Bradley Headstone and Eugene Wrayburn, she fears Headstone's violent passion and yearns for Wrayburn's love, while acutely aware of the social gap between them. Lizzie saves Wrayburn from Headstone's attack and the two are married. She in effect acts as the moral centre of the story and is by far the \"most wholly good character [\u2026] almost bereft of ego\".<ref name=\"Romano, John 1978\"/> Dickens carries over her moral superiority into her physical characterisation. Her \"capacity for self-sacrifice [\u2026] is only slightly more credible than her gift for refined speech\",<ref name=\"Romano, John 1978\"/> making her slightly unbelievable in comparison to her uneducated father and Jenny Wren. Lizzie's concern about social class reveals her reasoning for ensuring her brother's escape from poverty and ignorance, though she remains humble about her own situation. However, her moral character attracts Wrayburn and her inherent goodness is rewarded with marital happiness.\n* '''Charley Hexam''' \u2013 is the son of Jesse \"Gaffer\" Hexam and a brother of Lizzie. Originally a very caring brother, this changes as he rises above Lizzie in class and must remove himself from her to maintain his social standing. He was born into poverty, but receives schooling and becomes a teacher under Headstone's mentoring. Dickens uses him to critique both the schooling available to the poor, which was often over-crowded and noisy,<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://omf.ucsc.edu/london-1865/schools-and-education/educators-and-education.html |last=Watt |first=Kate Carnell |title= Educators and Education in ''Our Mutual Friend'' |journal=Our Mutual Friend: The Scholarly Pages |location=Santa Cruz |publisher=University of California |accessdate=17 April 2009}}</ref> as well as the snobbish tendencies of those who manage to rise in status. Hexam is presented as \"morally corrupt\",<ref name=Swifte1999 /> because of how he  distances himself from his past, and from his loving sister, in the name of his own upward movement.\n* '''Mortimer Lightwood''' \u2013 is a lawyer, who is an acquaintance of the Veneerings and a friend of Eugene Wrayburn. Lightwood acts as the \"storyteller\" and it is through him that the reader and the other characters learn about Harmon's will.<ref name=\"Romano, John 1978\"/> However, under the \"mask of irony\"<ref name=\"Romano, John 1978\"/> he assumes in telling his stories, he feels true friendship for Eugene, respect for Twemlow, and concern for the issues in which he is involved. In addition, he also serves as the \"commentator and a voice of conscience\"<ref name=\"Hawes, Donald 1998\"/> with sarcasm sometimes covering his concern. Through Lightwood's reason and advice, the reader is better able to judge the characters' actions.\n* '''Eugene Wrayburn''' \u2013 who is seen as the novel's second hero, is a barrister, and a gentleman by birth, though he is roguish and insolent. He is a close friend of Mortimer Lightwood, and involved in a love triangle with Lizzie Hexam and Bradley Headstone. Both these characters act as foils to Wrayburn. Lizzie contrasts with Eugene's more negative traits and Headstone makes Eugene appear more virtuous. He is nearly killed by Headstone but, like Harmon/Rokesmith, \"reborn\" after his incident in the river.<ref name=\"Thurley, Geoffrey 1976\"/> Though Wrayburn appears morally grey through most of the novel, by the end he is seen as a moral, sympathetic character and a true gentleman, after choosing to marry Lizzie in order to save her reputation, even though she is socially below him.<ref name=Ihara1998>{{cite web |url= http://www.dickens.jp/archive/omf/omf-ihara.pdf |last=Ihara |first=Keiichiro |title=Dickens and Class: Social Mobility in 'Our Mutual Friend' |publisher=Hiroshima University thesis |date=7 September 1998 |accessdate=17 April 2009 }}</ref>\n* '''Jenny Wren''' \u2013 whose real name is ''Fanny Cleaver'', is \"the dolls' dressmaker\", with whom Lizzie lives after her father dies. She is crippled with a bad back, although not ugly. She is very motherly towards her drunken father, whom she calls her \"bad child\".<ref name=Dickens1989ed /> Jenny later cares for Eugene while he recovers from Headstone's attack on his life. She may have a romance with Sloppy at the end of the book, which the reader may surmise will end in marriage. Although her mannerisms give her a certain \"strangeness\",<ref name=\"Romano, John 1978\"/> Jenny is very perceptive, identifying Eugene Wrayburn's intentions towards Lizzie in his small actions. Her role is a creator and a caretaker, and her \"pleasant fancies\" of \"flowers, bird song, numbers of blessed, white-clad children\"<ref name=\"Hawes, Donald 1998\"/> reflect the mind's ability to rise above adverse circumstances.\n* '''Mr Riah''' \u2013 is a Jew who manages Mr Fledgeby's money-lending business. He cares for and assists Lizzie Hexam and Jenny Wren when they have no one else. Some critics believe that Riah was meant by Dickens to act as an apology for his stereotyping of Fagin in ''Oliver Twist'', and in particular a response to Mrs. Eliza Davis. She had written to Dickens complaining that \"the portrayal of Fagin did 'a great wrong' to all Jews.\" However, some still take issue with Riah, asserting that he is \"too gentle to be a believable human being.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Morse |first=J Mitchell |title=Prejudice and Literature |journal=College English |volume=37 |number=8 |date=April 1976 |pages=780\u2013807 |publisher=National Council of Teachers of English |jstor=376012|doi=10.2307/376012 }}</ref>\n* '''Bradley Headstone''' \u2013 began life as a pauper<ref name=Dickens1989ed /> but rose to become Charley Hexam's schoolmaster and the love interest of Miss Peecher. However, he ignores her and falls in love with Lizzie Hexam, whom he pursues passionately and violently, though his advances are rejected. He then develops an insane jealousy towards Eugene Wrayburn, whom he follows at night like an \"ill-tamed wild animal\"<ref name=Dickens1989ed /> in hopes of catching him with Lizzie together. He disguises himself as Rogue Riderhood and almost succeeds in drowning Wrayburn. After Riderhood realises that Headstone is impersonating him to incriminate him for Wrayburn's murder, he attempts to blackmail Headstone, and this leads to a fight, and both men drowning in the river. Described repeatedly as \"decent\" and \"constrained\",<ref name=Dickens1989ed /> Headstone's personality splits between \"painfully respectable\"<ref name=\"Collins, Philip 1968\">{{cite book |last=Collins |first=Philip |title=Dickens and Crime |url=https://archive.org/details/dickenscrime00coll |url-access=registration |location=Bloomington |publisher=Indiana University Press |year=1968}}</ref> and \"wild jealousy\", with a \"passion terrible in its violence\".<ref name=\"Collins, Philip 1964\">{{cite book |last=Collins |first=Philip |title=Dickens and Education |location=New York |publisher=St Martin's Press |year=1964}}</ref> He is presented by Dickens as an animal in the night and a respectable, \"mechanical\"<ref name=\"Romano, John 1978\"/> schoolteacher during the day. A possible explanation for this dichotomy may be Headstone's \"intellectual insecurity\",<ref name=\"Collins, Philip 1964\"/> that manifests itself in violence after Lizzie's rejection.  The \"most complex of Dickens's villain-murderers are presented as such double-figures\".<ref name=\"Collins, Philip 1968\"/> Dickens here demonstrates the way identity can be manipulated. Headstone also serves as a foil to Wrayburn, and his evil nature antagonizes Wrayburn, as much as Lizzie's goodness helps him.\n* '''Silas Wegg''' \u2013 is ballad-seller with a wooden leg. He is a \"social parasite\",<ref name=Ihara1998 /> hired to read for the Boffins and teach Mr Boffin how to read, despite not being entirely literate himself. Wegg finds Harmon's will in the dust heaps, and he and Venus attempt to use it to blackmail the Boffins. He wishes to buy back his own leg as soon as he has the money, which is an attempt to \"complete himself\".<ref name=\"Thurley, Geoffrey 1976\"/> Wegg claims to want the leg so that he can be seen as respectable. Some critics find the juxtaposition of Wegg's villainy and his sense of humour to be inconsistent.\n* '''Mr Venus''' \u2013 a [[taxidermist]] and articulator of bones, who is in love with Pleasant Riderhood, whom he eventually marries. He meets Silas Wegg after having procured his amputated leg and he pretends to join Silas in blackmailing Mr Boffin regarding Harmon's will, while really informing Boffin of Silas's scheme. Dickens is said to have based Mr. Venus on a real taxidermist named J Willis, although Venus's \"defining obsession\" renders him \"among Dickens's most outlandish, least realistic\" characters.<ref name=\"Romano, John 1978\"/>\n* '''Mr Alfred Lammle''' \u2013 is married to Sophronia Lammle. Both of them, at the time of their marriage, were under the false impression that the other was fairly wealthy. Subsequently, they are forced to use their overabundance of charm and superficiality in attempts to make influential acquaintances and gain money through them.\n* '''Mrs Sophronia Lammle''' \u2013 is described, early in the novel, as \"the mature young lady\" and a proper young woman. However, this turns out to be ironic as she is later shown to be greedy, cold, and manipulative. She married Alfred Lammle because she believed he had money, and when it turned out he did not, the two of them formed a partnership that involves swindling money from others. They, for example, conspire to trap Georgiana Podsnap in a marriage with Fledgeby, though Sophronia repents before this plan can come to fruition, and arranges for Twemlow to inform the Podsnaps without her husband's knowledge.\n* '''Georgiana Podsnap''' \u2013 a daughter of Mr and Mrs Podsnap, who  is very sheltered, shy, trusting and na\u00efve. Because of this she is taken advantage of by more manipulative upper-class characters, such as Fledgeby and the Lammles, who scheme to \"befriend\" her and take her money. She is courted by Fledgeby, through Alfred Lammle, although not with honourable intentions, and nearly finds herself trapped in a marriage with Fledgeby until Sophronia Lammle suffers a change of heart.\n* '''Mr Fledgeby''' \u2013 called ''Fascination Fledgeby'' is a friend of the Lammles. He owns Mr Riah's moneylending business and is greedy and corrupt and makes his money through speculation. He provides a contrast with Mr Riah's gentleness, and underlines the point that \"a Jew may be kindly and a Christian cruel\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Dark |first=Sidney |author-link=Sidney Dark |url=https://archive.org/stream/charlesdickens00darkuoft/charlesdickens00darkuoft_djvu.txt |title=Charles Dickens |publisher=T Nelson & Sons |year=1919 |accessdate=16 April 2009}}</ref> Fledgeby nearly marries Georgiana Podsnap to gain access to her money, but Sophronia Lammle backs out of the scheme and, once Fledgeby is no longer allied with the Lammles, they seek him out and beat him.\n* '''Roger \"Rogue\" Riderhood''' \u2013 \"Gaffer\" Hexam's partner until Gaffer rejects him when he is convicted of theft. In revenge for that slight he falsely turns Gaffer in as the murderer of John Harmon, in the hope of receiving a reward. Later, Riderhood becomes a lock-keeper, and Headstone attempts to frame him for the murder of Eugene Wrayburn. After attempts to blackmail Headstone, the two men fall in the river Thames during a fight and both drown. In his \"literally irredeemable villainy\",<ref name=\"Romano, John 1978\"/> Riderhood represents an opportunistic character who will change his behaviour according to whatever suits his needs best at any given moment.\n* '''Reginald \"Rumty\" Wilfer''' \u2013 is Bella Wilfer's doting father, who is gentle, innocent, fatherly, and kindly, despite his querulous wife and daughter and thankless work as a clerk. Dickens describes him in almost childish terms, and he is often called \"the Cherub\".\n\n===Minor characters===\n* '''Mr Inspector''' \u2013 a police officer, who acts as a witness to several important events, such as when the corpse from the river is mistakenly identified as John Harmon, when Gaffer Hexam is taken into custody, and when the real John Harmon is named.<ref name=\"Hawes, Donald 1998\"/> In general, he is \"imperturbable, omnicompetent, firm but genial, and an accomplished actor\",<ref name=\"Collins, Philip 1968\"/> who commands authority. However he is not particularly effective in his administration of the law, and this leads to doubt about the justice system in the novel.\n* '''Mr John Podsnap''' \u2013 a pompous man of the upper middle class, married to Mrs Podsnap and the father of Georgiana, who is smug and jingoistic. Some critics believe that Dickens used Podsnap to satirise [[John Forster (biographer)|John Forster]], Dickens's lifelong friend and official biographer. However, Dickens insisted he only used some of Forster's mannerisms for this character, who was in no way to represent his closest friend. Forster, like Dickens, rose with difficulty from an impoverished middle-class background.<ref name=Ackroyd1991>{{cite book |last=Ackroyd |first=Peter |author-link=Peter Ackroyd |title=Dickens |location=New York |publisher=Harper-Collins |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-06-016602-1 |url=https://archive.org/details/dickens00ackr_1 }}</ref> The character of Podsnap was used to represent the views of \"Society,\" as shown in his disapproval of Lizzie Hexam and Eugene Wrayburn's marriage.<ref name=Ihara1998 />\n* '''Mrs Podsnap''' \u2013 the mother of Georgiana Podsnap. Though she embodies the materialistic ideals of her husband and daughter, Mrs Podsnap is the least prominent of the family. She is described as a \"fine woman\"<ref name=Dickens1989ed /> in her embodiment of the typical upper-class wife.\n* '''Mrs Wilfer''' \u2013 Bella's mother, a woman who is never satisfied with what she has. Her haughtiness is apparent in the way she acts at the Boffins's home and when Bella and Rokesmith return after their wedding. Her animosity towards her husband, her greed and discontent contrast with her husband's good nature and provide an image of what Bella could become, should she not change.\n* '''Lavinia Wilfer''' \u2013 Bella's younger sister and George Sampson's fianc\u00e9e. Vocal and opinionated, she is the only character who will stand up to Mrs Wilfer by matching her derisiveness and audacity. In some ways, she acts as a foil to Bella, and while Bella overcomes her desire for money and appreciates other aspects of life, Lavinia remains resentful in her poverty.\n* '''George Sampson''' \u2013 Lavinia Wilfer's suitor, who was originally in love with Bella. He provides comic relief and a contrast with the idyllic relationship between Bella and Rokesmith/Harmon.\n* '''Mr Melvin Twemlow''' \u2013 the well-connected friend of the Veneerings, who is often cultivated for his supposed influence with powerful people, such as Lord Snigsworth. Mrs Lammle tells him about their plot to marry Georgiana Podsnap and Fledgeby, to whom Twemlow owes money. Though Twemlow is introduced as being as insensible as a table at the Veneerings' dinner party, he comes to reflect a wise way of thinking. His wearing of a collar and cravat creates \"picturesque and archaic\" impression,<ref name=\"Romano, John 1978\"/> and he proves himself a \"true gentleman in his response to Wrayburn's marriage\".<ref name=\"Romano, John 1978\"/>\n* '''Mrs Betty Higden''' \u2013 a child-minder, who takes in poor children and cares for them, including Johnny, the orphan whom the Boffins plan to adopt before he dies in the children's hospital. She is old and poor, and portrayed sympathetically as pitiable. She is so terrified of dying in the workhouse that, when she begins to grow sick, she runs away to the country and ends up dying in Lizzie Hexam's arms. Mrs Higden draws readers' attention to the miserable lives led by the poor, and the need for social reform.\n* '''Johnny''' \u2013 the orphan great-grandson of Betty Higden. The Boffins plan on adopting Johnny, but he dies in the Children's Hospital before they are able to do so.\n* '''Sloppy''' \u2013 a foundling who assists Betty Higden in taking care of children. Raised in the workhouse, he has a learning disability, but is nevertheless adept at reading the newspaper for Mrs. Higden. He is portrayed as inherently innocent because of his disability, and carts away Wegg at the end of the novel. \n* '''Jesse \"Gaffer\" Hexam''' \u2013 a waterman and the father of Lizzie and Charley, who makes a living by robbing corpses found in the river Thames. His former partner, Rogue Riderhood, turns him in for the murder of John Harmon after Harmon's body is supposedly dragged from the river. A search is mounted to find and arrest Gaffer, but he is discovered dead in his boat. Gaffer's opposition to education prompts Lizzie to sneak Charley away to school, though she stays with her father. As a result, Gaffer disowns Charley as a son. In a sense, Gaffer predicted the alienating effect education would have on Charley.\n* '''Pleasant Riderhood''' \u2013 the daughter of Rogue Riderhood, who works in a pawn shop, and, like Jenny Wren and Lizzie Hexam, is another daughter caring for her abusive father as though he were her child, and who, in vain, tries to steer him along the path of right.<ref name=\"Adrian, Arthur A 1984\">{{cite book |last=Adrian |first=Arthur A |title=Dickens and the Parent-Child Relationship |url=https://archive.org/details/dickensparentchi0000adri |url-access=registration |location= Athens |publisher=Ohio University Press |year=1984 |isbn=978-0821407356}}</ref><ref name=\"Slater, Michael 1983\">{{cite book |last=Slater |first=Michael |title=Dickens and Women |location=Stanford |publisher=Stanford University Press |year=1983 |isbn=9780804711807}}</ref> She eventually marries Mr. Venus.\n* '''Mr and Mrs Veneering''' \u2013 a nouveaux-riches husband and wife whose main preoccupation is to advance in the social world. They invite influential people to their dinner parties where their furniture gleams with a sheen that they also put on to make themselves seem more impressive. They \"wear\" their acquaintances, their possessions, and their wealth like jewellery, in an attempt to impress those around them. Veneering eventually goes bankrupt and they retire to France to live on the jewels he bought for his wife.\n* '''Miss Abbey Potterson''' \u2013 mistress of the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters, she keeps the inn respectable, and only allows patrons to drink as much as she sees fit. She is likened, humorously, to a schoolmistress, linking her to the novel's concern with education.<ref>{{cite book |last=Schlicke |first=Paul |title=Dickens and Popular Entertainment |location=London |isbn=9780044451808 |publisher=Unwin Hyman |year=1988}}</ref>\n* '''Miss Peecher''' \u2013 a school teacher who is in love with Bradley Headstone. She is a \"good and harmless\" character, though she displays an \"addiction to rules and forms\".<ref name=\"Romano, John 1978\"/> In addition, she shows a \"naive confidence in the outward appearance of things\",<ref name=\"Romano, John 1978\"/> as demonstrated by her love of Headstone, a villain who gives the impression of being good.\n* '''Mr Dolls''' \u2013 Jenny Wren's alcoholic father. Jenny calls him her \"bad child\", and treats him accordingly.<ref name=\"Adrian, Arthur A 1984\"/><ref name=\"Slater, Michael 1983\"/> His real name is not known to Eugene, so Eugene calls him \"Mr Dolls\". As his daughter is really named Fanny Cleaver, his name might be Mr. Cleaver, but he is never called by a name other than \"my bad child\", or \"Mr Dolls\" in the novel.\n* '''George Radfoot''' - third mate on the ship bringing John Harmon back to England, whose dead body, found in the river by Gaffer Hexam, is identified as being Harmon, because of the papers found in his pockets. He had been involved in crimes and schemes with Riderhood, who most likely was responsible for trying to kill Harmon and killing Radfoot.\n\n==Plot summary==\nHaving made his fortune from London's rubbish, a rich misanthropic miser dies, estranged from all except his faithful employees Mr and Mrs Boffin. By his will, his fortune goes to his estranged son John Harmon, who is to return from where he has settled abroad (possibly in South Africa) to claim it, on condition that he marries a woman he has never met, Miss Bella Wilfer. The implementation of the will is in the charge of the solicitor, Mortimer Lightwood, who has no other practice.\n\nThe son and heir does not appear, though some knew him aboard the ship to London. A body is found in the Thames by Gaffer Hexam, rowed by his daughter Lizzie. He is a waterman who makes his living by retrieving corpses and taking the cash in their pockets, before handing them over to the authorities. Papers in the pockets of the drowned man identify him as the heir, John Harmon. Present at the identification of the water-soaked corpse is a mysterious young man, who gives his name as Julius Handford and then disappears.\n\nBy the terms of the miser's will, the whole estate then devolves upon Mr and Mrs Boffin, na\u00efve and good-hearted people who wish to enjoy it for themselves and to share it with others. They take the disappointed bride of the drowned heir, Miss Wilfer, into their household, and treat her as their pampered child and heiress. They also accept an offer from Julius Handford, now going under the name of John Rokesmith, to serve as their confidential secretary and man of business, at no salary. Rokesmith uses this position to watch and learn everything about the Boffins, Miss Wilfer, and the aftershock of the drowning of the heir John Harmon. Mr Boffin engages a one-legged ballad-seller, Silas Wegg, to read aloud to him in the evenings, and Wegg tries to take advantage of his position and of Mr Boffin's good heart to obtain other advantages from the wealthy [[dustman]]. When the Boffins purchase a large home, Wegg is invited to live in the old Harmon home. Wegg hopes to find hidden treasure in the house or in the mounds of trash on the property.\n\nGaffer Hexam, who found the body, is accused of murdering John Harmon by a fellow-waterman, Roger \"Rogue\" Riderhood, who is bitter at having been cast off as Hexam's partner on the river, and who covets the large reward offered in relation to the murder. As a result of the accusation, Hexam is shunned by his fellows on the river, and excluded from The Six Jolly Fellowship-Porters, the public house they frequent. Hexam's young son, the clever but priggish Charley Hexam, leaves his father's house to better himself at school, and to train to be a schoolmaster, encouraged by his sister, the beautiful Lizzie Hexam. Lizzie stays with her father, to whom she is devoted.\n\nBefore Riderhood can claim the reward for his false allegation against Hexam, Hexam is found drowned himself. Lizzie Hexam becomes the lodger of a doll's dressmaker, a disabled teenager nicknamed \"Jenny Wren\". Jenny's alcoholic father lives with them, and is treated by Jenny as a child. Lizzie has caught the eye of the work-shy barrister, Eugene Wrayburn, who first noticed her when accompanying his friend Mortimer Lightwood to the home of Gaffer Hexam. Wrayburn falls in love with her. However, he soon gains a violent rival in Bradley Headstone, the schoolmaster of Charley Hexam. Charley wants his sister to be under obligation to no one but him, and tries to arrange lessons for her with Headstone, only to find that Wrayburn has already engaged a teacher for both Lizzie and Jenny. Headstone quickly becomes attracted to Lizzie, with unreasonable passion, and makes an unsuccessful proposal. Angered by being refused and by Wrayburn's dismissive attitude towards him, Headstone comes to see him as the source of all his misfortunes, and takes to following him around the streets of London at night. Lizzie fears Headstone's threats to Wrayburn and is unsure of Wrayburn's intentions toward her. (Wrayburn admits to Lightwood that he does not know his own intentions yet, either.) She flees both men, getting work up-river from London.\n\nMr and Mrs Boffin attempt to adopt a young orphan, in the care of his great-grandmother, Betty Higden, but the boy dies before the adoption can proceed. Mrs Higden minds children for a living, assisted by a foundling known as Sloppy. She has a terror of the workhouse. When Lizzie Hexam finds Mrs Higden dying, she meets the Boffins and Bella Wilfer. In the meantime Eugene Wrayburn has obtained information about Lizzie's whereabouts from Jenny's father and finds the object of his affections. Bradley Headstone engages with Riderhood, now working as a lock-keeper, as Headstone is consumed with making good his threats about Wrayburn. After following Wrayburn up river and seeing him with Lizzie, Headstone attacks Wrayburn and leaves him for dead. Lizzie finds him in the river and rescues him. Wrayburn, thinking he will die anyway, marries Lizzie, and suppresses any hint that Headstone was his attacker to save her reputation. When he survives, he is glad that this has brought him into a loving marriage, albeit with a social inferior. He had not cared about the social gulf between them but Lizzie had and would not otherwise have married him.\n\nRokesmith is in love with Bella Wilfer but she cannot bear to accept him, having insisted that she will marry only for money. Mr Boffin appears to be corrupted by his wealth and becomes a miser. He also begins to treat his secretary Rokesmith with contempt and cruelty. This arouses the sympathy of Bella Wilfer, and she stands up for Rokesmith when Mr Boffin dismisses him for aspiring to marry her. They marry and live happily, in relatively poor circumstances. Bella soon conceives.\n\nMeanwhile, Bradley Headstone tries to put the blame for his assault on Wrayburn onto Rogue Riderhood, by dressing in similar clothes when doing the deed and then putting his own clothes in the river. Riderhood fetches the bundle of clothing and attempts to blackmail Headstone. Headstone is overcome with the hopelessness of his situation, as Wrayburn is alive, recovering from the brutal beating, and is married to Lizzie. Confronted by Riderhood in his classroom, Headstone is seized with a self-destructive urge, proceeding to the lock, where he flings himself into the lock, pulling Riderhood with him so that both are drowned.\n\nThe one-legged parasite Silas Wegg has, with help from Mr Venus, an \"articulator of bones\", searched the mounds of dust and discovered a will subsequent to the one which has given the Boffins the whole of the Harmon estate. By the later will, the estate goes to the Crown. Wegg decides to blackmail Boffin with this will, but Venus has second thoughts and reveals all to Boffin.\n\nIt has gradually become clear to the reader that John Rokesmith is the missing heir, John Harmon. He had been drugged and dumped in the river by Riderhood, who gave the same treatment to Harmon's shipmate. Harmon survived the attempted murder, done to rob him of the money he had from the sale of his business. The switch of clothes between the two men was done by Harmon to have a chance to learn about the girl before claiming his inheritance; the shipmate agreed with the intention of the theft of Harmon's cash, but Riderhood took it all. Rokesmith/Harmon has been maintaining his alias to try to win  Bella Wilfer without the force of the will and the wealth. Now that she has married him, believing him to be poor, he can throw off his disguise. He does so and it is revealed that Mr Boffin's apparent miserliness and ill-treatment of his secretary were part of a scheme to test Bella's motives about money.\n\nWhen Wegg attempts to clinch his blackmail on the basis of the later will disinheriting Boffin, Boffin turns the tables by revealing a still later will by which the fortune is granted to Boffin even at young John Harmon's expense. The Boffins are determined to make John Harmon and his bride Bella Wilfer their heirs anyway so all ends well, except for the villain Wegg, who is carted away by Sloppy. Sloppy himself becomes friendly with Jenny Wren, whose father has died.\n\nA sub-plot involves the activities of the devious Mr and Mrs Lammle, a couple who have married one another for money to live in society, only to discover that neither has any money. They attempt to obtain financial advantage by pairing off their acquaintance, Fledgeby, first with the heiress Georgiana Podsnap and later with Bella Wilfer. Fledgeby is an extortioner and money-lender, who uses the kindly old Jew, Riah, as his cover, temporarily causing Riah to fall out with his friend and prot\u00e9g\u00e9e Jenny Wren. Eventually, all attempts at improving their financial situation having failed, the Lammles leave England, Mr Lammle having first administered a sound beating to Fledgeby.\n\n==Original publication==\n''Our Mutual Friend'', like most Dickens novels, was published in 19 monthly instalments, each costing one shilling (with the exception of the nineteenth, which was double-length and cost two).

With regard to this the influence of the family is important. In many of Dickens's novels, including ''Our Mutual Friend'' and ''[[Little Dorrit]]'', parents try to force their children into arranged marriages.<ref name=\"California Press 1967\"/> John Harmon, for example, was supposed to marry Bella to suit the conditions of his father's will, and though initially, he refused to marry her for that reason. However, he later married her for love. Harmon goes against his father's wishes in another way by taking the alias of John Rokesmith he refuses his inheritance.<ref name=\"California Press 1967\"/> Bella is also swayed by the influence of her parents. Her mother wishes her to marry for money to better the fortunes of the entire family, although her father is happy with her marrying John Rokesmith for love. Bella's marriage to Rokesmith goes against what is expected of her by her mother, but eventually her mother accepts the fact that Bella has at least married someone who will make her happy. However, later on in the novel, Bella accepts the everyday duties of a wife, and seemingly gives up her independence.<ref name=Shuman1995>{{cite journal |last=Shuman |first=Cathy |title=Invigilating Our Mutual Friend: Gender and the Legitimation of Professional Authority |journal=Novel: A Forum on Fiction |volume=28 |issue=2 |date=Winter 1995 |pages=154\u2013172  |jstor=1345509 |publisher=Duke University Press |doi=10.2307/1345509 }}</ref> Yet she refuses to be the \"doll in the doll's house\";<ref name=Dickens1989ed /> and is not content with being a wife who rarely leaves her home without her husband. Furthermore, Bella reads up on the current events so that she can discuss them with her husband, and is actively involved in all of the couple's important decisions.\n\nLizzie Hexam also objects to the expectation of marriage to Eugene Wrayburn, because she sees the difference in their social class status. Without marriage, their connection risks her reputation. She does not aspire to marrying Wrayburn even though she loves him and would be elevated in society simply by marrying him, which almost any woman would have done at the time.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Lizzie feels that she is unworthy of him. Wrayburn, however, feels that he is unworthy of such a good woman. He also knows that his father would disapprove of her low social status.<ref name=\"California Press 1967\"/> She goes against expectations when she refuses to marry Bradley Headstone. He would have been an excellent match for her by social class, according to norms of the time, however, Lizzie does not love him.<ref name=\"California Press 1967\"/> She unselfishly does what others expect of her, like helping Charley escape their father to go to school, and living with Jenny Wren. Marrying Wrayburn is the only truly selfish act Lizzie commits in ''Our Mutual Friend'', out of her love for him, when he made up his mind to ask her.\n\n===Status of women===\nBecause of the rapid increase in wealth generated by the Industrial Revolution, women gained power through their households and class positions. It was up to the women in Victorian society to display their family's rank by decorating their households. This directly influenced the man's business and class status. Upper-class homes were ornate, as well as packed full of materials,<ref name=Langland1992290 /> so that \"A lack of clutter was to be considered in bad taste.\" Through handcrafts and home improvement, women asserted their power over the household: \"The making of a true home is really our peculiar and inalienable right: a right, which no man can take from us; for a man can no more make a home than a drone can make a hive\" (Frances Cobbe).<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://jdh.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/19/1/11 |title=Home is where the Art is |first=Clive |last=Edwards |journal=Journal of Design History |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=11\u201321 |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1 March 2006 |accessdate=8 April 2018|doi=10.1093/jdh/epk002 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/agunn/teaching/enl3251/vf/pres/romanski.html ''Upper Class Victorian Homes.''

In 1854, the ''[[Jewish Chronicle]]'' had asked why \"Jews alone should be excluded from the 'sympathizing heart' of this great author and powerful friend of the oppressed.\" Dickens (who had extensive knowledge of London street life and child exploitation) explained that he had made Fagin Jewish because \"it unfortunately was true, of the time to which the story refers, that that class of criminal almost invariably was a Jew\".<ref name=\"Oliver Twist intro\">{{Cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R63Gk3ntfFkC&lpg=PR19|title=Oliver Twist \u2013 introduction |last=Howe|first=Irving |publisher=Random House Publishing Group |year=2005 |isbn=9780553901566}}</ref> Dickens commented that by calling Fagin a Jew he had meant no imputation against the Jewish faith, saying in a letter, \"I have no feeling towards the Jews but a friendly one.

These manuals served as another method to distinguish oneself by social class. Etiquette books specifically targeted members of the middle and upper classes, and it was not until 1897 that a manual, specifically ''Book of the Household'', by Casell, addressed all the classes. Not only did the readership of etiquette manuals show class differences, but the practices prescribed within them became a way by which a member of the lower class could be identified.<ref name=Langland1992>{{cite journal |jstor=462641 |last=Langland |first=Elizabeth |title=Nobody's Angels: Domestic Ideology and Middle-Class Women in the Victorian Novel |journal=Modern Language Association |volume=107 |pages=290\u2013304 |number=2 |date=March 1992 |doi=10.2307/462641 }}</ref>\n\nMost etiquette manuals addressed such things as calling cards, the duration of the call, and what was acceptable to say and do during a visit. One of the most popular etiquette books was [[Isabella Beeton]]'s [[Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management|''Book of Household Management'']], which was published in 1861. In this book, Beeton claims that a call of fifteen to twenty minutes is \"quite sufficient\" and states, \"A lady paying a visit may remove her boa or neckerchief; but neither her shawl nor bonnet.\"<ref name=Langland1992 /> Beeton goes on to write, \"Of course no absorbed subject was ever spoken about. We kept ourselves to short sentences of small talk, and were punctual to our time.\"<ref name=Langland1992290>{{cite journal |jstor=462641 |last=Langland |first=Elizabeth |title=Nobody's Angels: Domestic Ideology and Middle-Class Women in the Victorian Novel |journal=Modern Language Association |volume=107 |number=2 |date=March 1992 |pages=290\u2013304 |doi=10.2307/462641 }}</ref>\n\nEtiquette books were constantly changing themes and ideas, so this also distinguished who was an \"insider\" and who was an \"outsider.\"<ref name=Langland1992290 />\n\n==Water imagery==\n\nA major symbol is the [[River Thames]], which is linked to the major theme of rebirth and renewal. Water is seen as a sign of new life, and associated with the Christian sacrament of [[Baptism]]. Characters like John Harmon and Eugene Wrayburn end up in the river, and come out reborn. Wrayburn emerges from the river close to death, but is ready to marry Lizzie, and to avoid naming his attacker to save her reputation. He surprises everyone, including himself, when he survives and goes on to have a loving marriage with Lizzie. John Harmon also appears to end up in the river through no fault of his own, and when Gaffer pulls his \"body\" out of the waters, he adopts the alias of John Rokesmith. This alias is for his own safety and peace of mind; he wants to know that he can do things on his own, and does not need his father's name or money to make a good life for himself.<ref name=\"California Press 1967\">Dabney, Ross H. ''Love & Property in the Novels of Dickens''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1967.</ref>\n\nDickens uses many images that relate to water. Phrases such as the \"depths and shallows of Podsnappery,\"<ref name=Dickens1989ed /> and the \"time had come for flushing and flourishing this man down for good\",<ref name=Dickens1989ed /> are examples of such imagery. Some critics see this as being used excessively<ref>{{cite journal |jstor=29533733|last=Reed |first=John R |title=The Riches of Redundancy: Our Mutual Friend |journal=Studies in the Novel |volume=38 |number=1 |date=Spring 2006 |pages=15\u201335 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press }}</ref>\n\n==Themes==\nAside from examining the novel's form and characters, modern critics of ''Our Mutual Friend'' have focused on identifying and analysing what they perceive as the main themes of the novel. Although Stanley Friedman's 1973 essay \"The Motif of Reading in ''Our Mutual Friend''\" emphasises references to literacy and illiteracy in the novel, Friedman states, \"Money, the dust-heaps, and the river have been seen as the main symbols, features, that help develop such themes as avarice, predation, death and rebirth, the quest for identity and pride. To these images and ideas, we may add what Monroe Engel calls the 'social themes of ''Our Mutual Friend''\u2014having to do with money-dust, and relatedly with the treatment of the poor, education, representative government, even the inheritance laws.'\"<ref name=Friedman1973>{{cite journal |first=Stanley |last=Friedman |title=The Motif of Reading in ''Our Mutual Friend'' |journal=Nineteenth-Century Fiction |volume=28 |number=1 |date=June 1973 |page=39 |accessdate=10 April 2018 |url=http://ncl.ucpress.edu/content/28/1/38}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Metz, many of the prominent themes in Dickens's earlier works of fiction are intricately woven into Dickens's last novel. She states, \"Like ''[[David Copperfield (novel)|David Copperfield]]'', ''Our Mutual Friend'' is about the relationship between work and the realization of self, about the necessity to be 'useful' before one can be 'happy.' Like ''[[Great Expectations]]'', it is about the power of money to corrupt those who place their faith in its absolute value. Like ''[[Bleak House]]'', it is about the legal, bureaucratic, and social barriers that intervene between individuals and their nearest neighbours.

Dallas]] felt that ''Our Mutual Friend'' was perfect. Rather, the oft acknowledged \"genius\" of Dickens seems to have overshadowed all reviews and made it impossible for most critics to completely condemn the work, the majority of these reviews being a mixture of praise and disparagement.\n\nIn November 1865 [[E.S. Dallas]], in ''The Times'', lauded ''Our Mutual Friend'' as \"one of the best of even Dickens's tales,\"<ref>Dallas, E S, Review, ''The Times'' 29 November 1865 quoted in  {{cite book |title=Dickens: The Critical Heritage |editor-first=Philip |editor-last=Collins |location=New York |publisher=Barnes & Noble |year=1971 |pages=464}}</ref> but was unable to ignore the flaws. \"This last novel of Mr Charles Dickens, really one of his finest works, and one in which on occasion he even surpasses himself, labours under the disadvantage of a beginning that drags ...

The 1865 review by [[Henry James]] in ''The Nation'' described every character as \"a mere bundle of eccentricities, animated by no principle of nature whatever\",<ref name=\"Henry James 1865\">{{cite journal |first=Henry |last=James |title=Our Mutual Friend |journal=The Nation |date=December 1865 |url=https://omf.ucsc.edu/publication/reviews/henry-james.html}}</ref> and condemned Dickens for a lack of characters who represent \"sound humanity\".<ref name=\"Henry James 1865\" /> James maintained that none of the characters add anything to the reader's understanding of human nature, and asserted that the characters in ''Our Mutual Friend'', were \"grotesque creatures\",<ref name=\"Henry James 1865\"/> who did not represent actual existing Victorian types.\n\nLike James, the 1869 article \"Table Talk\" in ''Once a Week'' did not view the characters in ''Our Mutual Friend'' as realistic. The article asks: \"Do men live by finding the bodies of the drowned, and landing them ashore 'with their pockets allus inside out' for the sake of the reward offered for their recovery? As far as we can make out, no. We have been at some trouble to inquire from men who should know; watermen, who have lived on the river nigh all their lives, if they have seen late at night a dark boat with a solitary occupant, drifting down the river on the 'look out,' plying his frightful trade? The answer has uniformly been 'No, we have never seen such men,' and more, they do not believe in their existence.\"<ref>\"Table Talk,\" ''Once a Week,'' (September 1869), 152.</ref>\n\nThe reviewer in the ''London Review'' in 1865 denounced the characters of Wegg and Venus, \"who appear to us in all the highest degree unnatural\u2014the one being a mere phantasm, and the other a nonentity.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Unsigned Review, ''London Review'', 28 October 1865,   quoted in {{cite book |title=Dickens: The Critical Heritage |editor-first=Philip |editor-last=Collins |location=New York |publisher=Barnes & Noble |year=1971 |pages=455}}</ref> However he applauded the creation of Bella Wilfer: \"Probably the greatest favourite in the book will be\u2014or rather is already\u2014Bella Wilfer.

His fancy, his pathos, his humour, his wonderful powers of observation, his picturesqueness, and his versatility, are as remarkable now as they were twenty years ago.\"<ref name=UnsignedOct1865>Unsigned Review, ''London Review'', 28 October 1865, quoted in   {{cite book |title=Dickens: The Critical Heritage |editor-first=Philip |editor-last=Collins |location=New York |publisher=Barnes & Noble |year=1971 |pages=454}}</ref> But like other critics, after praising the book this same critic then turned around and disparaged it: \"Not that we mean to say Mr Dickens has outgrown his faults. They are as obvious as ever\u2014sometimes even trying our patience rather hard. A certain extravagance in particular scenes and persons\u2014a tendency to caricature and grotesqueness\u2014and a something here and there which savours of the melodramatic, as if the author had been considering how the thing would 'tell' on the stage\u2014are to be found in ''Our Mutual Friend'', as in all this great novelist's productions.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nEdwin Whipple in 1867 also commented on the sentiment and pathos of Dickens's characters, stating, \"But the poetical, the humorous, the tragic, or the pathetic element is never absent in Dickens's characterization, to make his delineations captivating to the heart and imagination, and give the reader a sense of having escaped from whatever in the actual world is dull and wearisome.\"<ref>Whipple, Edwin P, \"The Genius of Dickens\", ''Atlantic Monthly'' May 1867 pp 546\u201354 quoted in   {{cite book |title=Dickens: The Critical Heritage |editor-first=Philip |editor-last=Collins |location=New York |publisher=Barnes & Noble |year=1971 |pages=482}}</ref>\n\nHowever, in 1869 [[George Stott (missionary)|George Stott]] condemned Dickens for being overly sentimental: \"Mr Dickens's pathos we can only regard as a complete and absolute failure. It is unnatural and unlovely. He attempts to make a stilted phraseology, and weak and sickly sentimentality do duty for genuine emotion.\"<ref>Stott, George, \"Charles Dickens\", ''Contemporary Review'' January 1869, pp 203\u201325 quoted in   {{cite book |title=Dickens: The Critical Heritage |editor-first=Philip |editor-last=Collins |location=New York |publisher=Barnes & Noble |year=1971 |pages=497}}</ref> Still, in the manner of all the other mixed reviews, Stott states that \"we still hold him to be emphatically a man of genius.\"<ref>Stott, George, \"Charles Dickens\", ''Contemporary Review'' January 1869, pp 203\u201325 quoted in   {{cite book |title=Dickens: The Critical Heritage |editor-first=Philip |editor-last=Collins |location=New York |publisher=Barnes & Noble |year=1971 |pages=492\u2013493}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Spectator'' in 1869 concurred with Stott's opinion, writing \"Mr Dickens has brought people to think that there is a sort of piety in being gushing and maudlin,\" and that his works are heavily imbued with the \"most mawkish and unreal sentimentalism\",<ref>Hutton, R H, \"Mr Dickens's Moral Services to Literature\", ''Spectator'' 17 April 1869, pp 474\u20135 quoted in  {{cite book |title=Dickens: The Critical Heritage |editor-first=Philip |editor-last=Collins |location=New York |publisher=Barnes & Noble |year=1971 |pages=490}}</ref> but the unsigned critic still maintained that Dickens was one of the great authors of his time.<ref name=UnsignedOct1865 />\n\n===Later literary criticism===\n[[G. K. Chesterton]], one of Dickens's critics in the early 20th century, expressed the opinion that Mr Boffin's pretended fall into miserliness was originally intended by Dickens to be authentic, but that Dickens ran out of time and so took refuge in the awkward pretence that Boffin had been acting. Chesterton argues that while we might believe Boffin could be corrupted, we can hardly believe he could keep up such a strenuous pretence of corruption: \"Such a character as his\u2014rough, simple and lumberingly unconscious\u2014might be more easily conceived as really sinking in self-respect and honour than as keeping up, month after month, so strained and inhuman a theatrical performance. ... It might have taken years to turn Noddy Boffin into a [[miser]]; but it would have taken centuries to turn him into an actor.\"<ref name=Chesterton>{{cite web |url=https://omf.ucsc.edu/scholarship/bibliography/chesterton-text.html|title=Our Mutual Friend |last=Chesterton |first=G K |accessdate=6 April 2018 |work=Our Mutual Friend: The Scholarly Pages |location=Santa Cruz, California }}</ref> However, Chesterton also praised the book as being a return to Dickens's youthful optimism and creative exuberance, full of characters who \"have that great Dickens quality of being something which is pure farce and yet which is not superficial; an unfathomable farce\u2014a farce that goes down to the roots of the universe.\"<ref name=Chesterton />\n\nIn his 1940 article \"Dickens: Two Scrooges\", [[Edmund Wilson]] states, \"''Our Mutual Friend,'' like all these later books of Dickens, is more interesting to us today than it was to Dickens's public. Certainly the subtleties and profundities that are now discovered in it were not noticed by the reviewers.\"<ref name=Wilson2007>{{citation |first=Edmund |last=Wilson |chapter=Dickens: Two Scrooges |title=The Wound and the Bow |location=New York |publisher=Library of America |year=2007 |isbn=9780821411896 |page=66}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Wilson |first=Edmund |title=Dickens:The Two Scrooges |date=3 March 1940 |journal=New Republic |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/100447/the-two-scrooges |accessdate=10 April 2018}}</ref> As a whole, modern critics of ''Our Mutual Friend'', particularly those of the last half century, have been more appreciative of Dickens's last completed work than his contemporary reviewers. Although some modern critics find Dickens's characterisation in ''Our Mutual Friend'' problematic, most tend to positively acknowledge the novel's complexity and appreciate its multiple plot lines.\n\nIn November 2019, the ''[[BBC News]]'' listed ''Our Mutual Friend'' on its list of the [[BBC list of 100 'most inspiring' novels|100 most influential novels]].<ref name=Bbc2019-11-05/>\n\n====Form and plot====\nIn his 2006 article \"The Richness of Redundancy: ''Our Mutual Friend,''\" John R Reed states, \"''Our Mutual Friend'' has not pleased many otherwise satisfied readers of Dickens's fiction. For his contemporaries and such acute assessors of fiction as Henry James, the novel seemed to lack structure, among other faults. More recently, critics have discovered ways in which Dickens can be seen experimenting in the novel.\"<ref name=Reed200615>{{cite journal |jstor=29533733|last=Reed |first=John R |title=The Riches of Redundancy: Our Mutual Friend |journal=Studies in the Novel |volume=38 |pages=15\u201335 |number=1 |date=Spring 2006 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press }}</ref> Reed maintains that Dickens's establishment of \"an incredibly elaborate structure\" for ''Our Mutual Friend'' was an extension of Dickens's quarrel with realism. In creating a highly formal structure for his novel, which called attention to the novel's own language, Dickens embraced taboos of realism. Reed also argues that Dickens's employment of his characteristic technique of offering his reader what might be seen as a surplus of information within the novel, in the form of a pattern of references, exists as a way for Dickens to guarantee that the meaning of his novel might be transmitted to his reader. Reed cites Dickens's multiple descriptions of the River Thames and repetitive likening of Gaffer to \"a roused bird of prey\" in the novel's first chapter as evidence of Dickens's use of redundancy to establish two of the novel's fundamental themes: preying/scavenging and the transformative powers of water. According to Reed, to notice and interpret the clues representing the novel's central themes that Dickens gives his reader, the reader must have a surplus of these clues. Echoing Reed's sentiments, in her 1979 article \"The Artistic Reclamation of Waste in ''Our Mutual Friend'',\" Nancy Aycock Metz claims, \"The reader is thrown back upon his own resources. He must suffer, along with the characters of the novel, from the climate of chaos and confusion, and like them, he must begin to make connections and impose order on the details he observes.\"<ref name=Metz1979>{{cite journal |first=Nancy Aycock |last=Metz |title=The Artistic Reclamation of Waste in ''Our Mutual Friend'' |journal=Nineteenth-Century Fiction |volume=34 |number=1 |date=June 1979 |page=62 |publisher=University of California Press |jstor=2933598}}</ref>\n\nIn his 1995 article \"The Cup and the Lip and the Riddle of ''Our Mutual Friend''\", Gregg A Hecimovich reaffirms Metz's notion of reading the novel as a process of connection and focuses on what he sees as one of the main aspects of Dickens's narrative: \"a complex working out of the mysteries and idiosyncrasies presented in the novel.\"<ref name=Hecimovich1995>{{cite journal |first=Gregg A |last=Hecimovich |title=The Cup and the Lip and the Riddle of ''Our Mutual Friend |journal=ELH |volume=62 |pages=955\u2013977 |number=4 |date=Winter 1995 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |jstor=30030109|doi=10.1353/elh.1995.0037 }}</ref> Unlike Dickens's contemporary critics, Hecimovich commends Dickens for ''Our Mutual Friend'''s disjunctive, riddle-like structure and manipulation of plots, declaring, \"In a tale about conundrums and questions of identity, divergence of plots is desirable.\"<ref name=Hecimovich1995967>{{cite journal |first=Gregg A |last=Hecimovich |title=The Cup and the Lip and the Riddle of ''Our Mutual Friend. |journal=ELH |volume=62 |number=4 |date=Winter 1995 |page=967 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |jstor=30030109}}</ref> Hecimovich goes on to say that in structuring his last novel as a riddle-game, Dickens challenges conventions of nineteenth-century Victorian England and that the \"sickness\" infecting Dickens's composition of ''Our Mutual Friend'' is that of Victorian society generally, not Dickens himself.\n\n====Characters====\nHarland S Nelson's 1973 article \"Dickens's ''Our Mutual Friend'' and [[Henry Mayhew]]'s ''London Labour and the London Poor''\" examines Dickens's inspiration for two of the novel's working class characters. Nelson asserts that Gaffer Hexam and Betty Higden were potentially modelled after real members of London's working class whom Mayhew interviewed in the 1840s for his nonfiction work ''London Labour and the London Poor.'' Unlike some of Dickens's contemporaries, who regarded the characters in ''Our Mutual Friend'' as unrealistic representations of actual Victorian people, Nelson maintains that London's nineteenth-century working class is authentically depicted through characters such as Gaffer Hexam and Betty Higden.<ref name=Nelson1970>{{cite journal |first=Harland S |last=Nelson |title=Dickens's ''Our Mutual Friend'' and Henry Mayhew's ''London Labour and the London Poor'' |journal=Nineteenth-Century Fiction |volume=24 |number=3 |date=December 1970 |pages=207\u2013222 |publisher=University of California Press |jstor=2932754}}</ref>\n\nWhile novelist [[Henry James]] dismissed the minor characters Jenny Wren, Mr Wegg, and Mr Venus as \"pathetic characters.\" in his 1865 review of the novel, Gregg Hecimovich in 1989 refers to them as \"important riddlers and riddlees.\"<ref name=Hecimovich962>{{cite journal |first=Gregg A |last= Hecimovich |title=The Cup and the Lip and the Riddle of ''Our Mutual Friend.'' |journal=ELH |volume=62 |number=4 |date=Winter 1995 |page=962 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |jstor=30030109}}</ref> Hecimovich suggests that, \"Through the example of his minor characters, Dickens directs his readers to seek, with the chief characters, order and structure out of the apparent disjunctive 'rubbish' in the novel, to analyze and articulate what ails a fallen London... Only then can the reader, mimicking the action of certain characters, create something 'harmonious' and beautiful out of the fractured waste land.\"<ref name=Hecimovich966>{{cite journal |first=Gregg A |last=Hecimovich |title=The Cup and the Lip and the Riddle of Our Mutual Friend |journal=ELH |volume=62 |number=4 |date=Winter 1995 |page=966 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |jstor=30030109}}</ref>\n\nSome modern critics of ''Our Mutual Friend'' have been overall more critical of the novel's characters. In her 1970 essay \"''Our Mutual Friend'': Dickens as the Compleat Angler,\" Annabel Patterson declares, \"''Our Mutual Friend'' is not a book which satisfies all of Dickens's admirers.

It centres on, in the words of critic [[J. Hillis Miller]], quoting from the character Bella Wilfer in the book, \"money, money, money, and what money can make of life\".<ref>Joseph Hillis Miller, ''Victorian Subjects''. Duke University Press, 1991, p. 69.</ref>\n\nMost reviewers in the 1860s continued to praise Dickens' skill as a writer in general, although not reviewing this novel in detail. Some found the plot both too complex and not laid out well.<ref name=\"New Books 1865\"/> ''The Times'' of London found the first few chapters did not draw the reader into the characters. In the 20th century, however, reviewers began to find much to approve in the later novels of Dickens, including ''Our Mutual Friend''.<ref name=Wilson2007 /> In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, some reviewers suggested that Dickens was, in fact, experimenting with structure,<ref name=Reed200615 /><ref name=Hecimovich1995 /> and that the characters considered somewhat flat and not recognized by the contemporary reviewers<ref name=Nelson1970 /> were meant rather to be true representations of the Victorian working class and the key to understanding the structure of the society depicted by Dickens in the novel.<ref name=Nelson1970 /><ref name=Hecimovich966 />\n\n==Characters==\n===Major characters===<!-- redirects anchor here -->\n* '''John Harmon''' \u2013 is heir to the Harmon estate, under the condition that he marry Bella Wilfer. He is presumed dead throughout most of the novel, though he is living under the name '''John Rokesmith''', and working as a secretary for the Boffins in an attempt to better get to know Bella, the Boffins, and people's general reaction to John Harmon's \"death\". Harmon also uses the alias '''Julius Handford''' upon first returning to London. Harmon's \"death\" and subsequent resurrection as Rokesmith/Handford is consistent with Dickens's recurring theme in the novel of rebirth from the water.<ref name=\"Thurley, Geoffrey 1976\">{{cite book |last=Thurley |first=Geoffrey |title=The Dickens Myth: Its Genesis and Structure |url=https://archive.org/details/dickensmythitsge0000thur |url-access=registration |location=London |publisher=Routledge and Kegan Paul |year=1976 |isbn=9780710084224}}</ref> His upward social mobility through his own efforts is presented as favourable, in contrast with Headstone, Hexam, and the Lammles.<ref name=Ihara1998 />\n* '''Bella Wilfer''' \u2013 is a beautiful girl born into poverty, who learns upon the death of Old Mr Harmon that she is the intended wife for his son, a condition of his inheritance. When her intended husband, John Harmon, is reported to have been killed, she is left without future prospects. She learns of the trouble money can bring when taken in by the newly-rich Boffins. Bella rejects Rokesmith's proposal at first but later accepts it. Initially described as a \"mercenary young woman\",<ref name=Dickens1989ed>{{cite book |last=Dickens |first=Charles |title=Our Mutual Friend |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1989 |isbn=978-0192817952}}</ref> who describes herself upon meeting Lizzie Hexam as having \"no more character than a canary bird\",<ref name=Dickens1989ed /> Bella undergoes a significant moral change in the novel. Although originally completely preoccupied with money, her complexity is eventually displayed in her ability to defy the societal pressures to achieve happiness unrelated to wealth. She is praised for her \"vivacity and lifelikeness\",<ref name=\"Romano, John 1978\">{{cite book |last=Romano |first=John |title=Dickens and Reality |location=New York |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=1978 |isbn=9780231042468 |url=https://archive.org/details/dickensreality0000roma }}</ref> with greater complexity than some of the other, more static characters. Her relationship with her father is more like that of a mother and son, as she consistently dotes upon him, calling him her \"cherub\".<ref name=Dickens1989ed /> She has an open and warm relationship with her father, which provides a stark contrast to the strained and resentful relationships between Bella and her mother and sister.\n* '''Nicodemus (Noddy) Boffin''',  '''the Golden [[Dustman]]''' \u2013 becomes a member of the ''[[nouveaux riches]]'' when Old Mr Harmon's heir is considered dead. He is illiterate, but wants to fit the image of a wealthy man, and so hires Silas Wegg to read to him in hopes of gaining more intelligence and worldliness. He is nearly blackmailed by Wegg. He assumes the role of a miser to show Bella the dangers of wealth, but eventually admits this behaviour was an act and gives his money to Bella and John. Boffin's innocence, na\u00efve curiosity, and desire to learn in his new position in life contrast with his \"elaborate performances as Boffin the miser\".<ref name=\"Romano, John 1978\"/> Critics speculate that Dickens's decision to have Boffin playing a part may not have been planned, as it was not very convincing for a man who has shown his simplistic ignorance on several occasions.<ref name=\"Hawes, Donald 1998\">{{cite book |last=Hawes |first=Donald |title=Who's Who in Dickens |location=London |publisher=Routledge |year=1998 |isbn=9780415260299}}</ref> Boffin's inheritance of Old Harmon's money is appropriate because Harmon had attained it by combing the dust heaps, because this suggests social mobility. Boffin represents a wholesome contrast to such wealthy characters as the Veneerings and Podsnaps, and may have been based on [[Henry Dodd]], a ploughboy who made his fortune removing London's rubbish.\n* '''Mrs Henrietta Boffin''' \u2013 is Noddy Boffin's wife, and a very motherly woman, who convinces Mr Boffin to take in an orphan boy called Johnny. This indicates \"another progressive development for Dickens as his female characters undertake a more active role in social reform\".<ref name=Swifte1999>{{cite web |url=http://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/2123/409/2/adt-NU2000.0013main.pdf |last=Swifte |first=Yasmin |title=Charles Dickens and the Role of Legal Institutions in Moral and Social Reform: ''Oliver Twist, Bleak House'' and ''Our Mutual Friend'' |publisher=University of Sydney Masters Thesis |accessdate=16 April 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219063234/http://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/2123/409/2/adt-NU2000.0013main.pdf |archive-date=19 February 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> \n* '''Lizzie Hexam''' \u2013 is a daughter of Gaffer Hexam and sister of Charley Hexam. She is an affectionate daughter, but knows that Charley must escape their living circumstances if he is to succeed in life, so she gives Charley her money and helps him leave while their father is away. Later she is rejected by Charley after she remains in poverty. Pursued romantically by both Bradley Headstone and Eugene Wrayburn, she fears Headstone's violent passion and yearns for Wrayburn's love, while acutely aware of the social gap between them. Lizzie saves Wrayburn from Headstone's attack and the two are married. She in effect acts as the moral centre of the story and is by far the \"most wholly good character [\u2026] almost bereft of ego\".<ref name=\"Romano, John 1978\"/> Dickens carries over her moral superiority into her physical characterisation. Her \"capacity for self-sacrifice [\u2026] is only slightly more credible than her gift for refined speech\",<ref name=\"Romano, John 1978\"/> making her slightly unbelievable in comparison to her uneducated father and Jenny Wren. Lizzie's concern about social class reveals her reasoning for ensuring her brother's escape from poverty and ignorance, though she remains humble about her own situation. However, her moral character attracts Wrayburn and her inherent goodness is rewarded with marital happiness.\n* '''Charley Hexam''' \u2013 is the son of Jesse \"Gaffer\" Hexam and a brother of Lizzie. Originally a very caring brother, this changes as he rises above Lizzie in class and must remove himself from her to maintain his social standing. He was born into poverty, but receives schooling and becomes a teacher under Headstone's mentoring. Dickens uses him to critique both the schooling available to the poor, which was often over-crowded and noisy,<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://omf.ucsc.edu/london-1865/schools-and-education/educators-and-education.html |last=Watt |first=Kate Carnell |title= Educators and Education in ''Our Mutual Friend'' |journal=Our Mutual Friend: The Scholarly Pages |location=Santa Cruz |publisher=University of California |accessdate=17 April 2009}}</ref> as well as the snobbish tendencies of those who manage to rise in status. Hexam is presented as \"morally corrupt\",<ref name=Swifte1999 /> because of how he  distances himself from his past, and from his loving sister, in the name of his own upward movement.\n* '''Mortimer Lightwood''' \u2013 is a lawyer, who is an acquaintance of the Veneerings and a friend of Eugene Wrayburn. Lightwood acts as the \"storyteller\" and it is through him that the reader and the other characters learn about Harmon's will.<ref name=\"Romano, John 1978\"/> However, under the \"mask of irony\"<ref name=\"Romano, John 1978\"/> he assumes in telling his stories, he feels true friendship for Eugene, respect for Twemlow, and concern for the issues in which he is involved. In addition, he also serves as the \"commentator and a voice of conscience\"<ref name=\"Hawes, Donald 1998\"/> with sarcasm sometimes covering his concern. Through Lightwood's reason and advice, the reader is better able to judge the characters' actions.\n* '''Eugene Wrayburn''' \u2013 who is seen as the novel's second hero, is a barrister, and a gentleman by birth, though he is roguish and insolent. He is a close friend of Mortimer Lightwood, and involved in a love triangle with Lizzie Hexam and Bradley Headstone. Both these characters act as foils to Wrayburn. Lizzie contrasts with Eugene's more negative traits and Headstone makes Eugene appear more virtuous. He is nearly killed by Headstone but, like Harmon/Rokesmith, \"reborn\" after his incident in the river.<ref name=\"Thurley, Geoffrey 1976\"/> Though Wrayburn appears morally grey through most of the novel, by the end he is seen as a moral, sympathetic character and a true gentleman, after choosing to marry Lizzie in order to save her reputation, even though she is socially below him.<ref name=Ihara1998>{{cite web |url= http://www.dickens.jp/archive/omf/omf-ihara.pdf |last=Ihara |first=Keiichiro |title=Dickens and Class: Social Mobility in 'Our Mutual Friend' |publisher=Hiroshima University thesis |date=7 September 1998 |accessdate=17 April 2009 }}</ref>\n* '''Jenny Wren''' \u2013 whose real name is ''Fanny Cleaver'', is \"the dolls' dressmaker\", with whom Lizzie lives after her father dies. She is crippled with a bad back, although not ugly. She is very motherly towards her drunken father, whom she calls her \"bad child\".<ref name=Dickens1989ed /> Jenny later cares for Eugene while he recovers from Headstone's attack on his life. She may have a romance with Sloppy at the end of the book, which the reader may surmise will end in marriage. Although her mannerisms give her a certain \"strangeness\",<ref name=\"Romano, John 1978\"/> Jenny is very perceptive, identifying Eugene Wrayburn's intentions towards Lizzie in his small actions. Her role is a creator and a caretaker, and her \"pleasant fancies\" of \"flowers, bird song, numbers of blessed, white-clad children\"<ref name=\"Hawes, Donald 1998\"/> reflect the mind's ability to rise above adverse circumstances.\n* '''Mr Riah''' \u2013 is a Jew who manages Mr Fledgeby's money-lending business. He cares for and assists Lizzie Hexam and Jenny Wren when they have no one else. Some critics believe that Riah was meant by Dickens to act as an apology for his stereotyping of Fagin in ''Oliver Twist'', and in particular a response to Mrs. Eliza Davis. She had written to Dickens complaining that \"the portrayal of Fagin did 'a great wrong' to all Jews.\" However, some still take issue with Riah, asserting that he is \"too gentle to be a believable human being.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Morse |first=J Mitchell |title=Prejudice and Literature |journal=College English |volume=37 |number=8 |date=April 1976 |pages=780\u2013807 |publisher=National Council of Teachers of English |jstor=376012|doi=10.2307/376012 }}</ref>\n* '''Bradley Headstone''' \u2013 began life as a pauper<ref name=Dickens1989ed /> but rose to become Charley Hexam's schoolmaster and the love interest of Miss Peecher. However, he ignores her and falls in love with Lizzie Hexam, whom he pursues passionately and violently, though his advances are rejected. He then develops an insane jealousy towards Eugene Wrayburn, whom he follows at night like an \"ill-tamed wild animal\"<ref name=Dickens1989ed /> in hopes of catching him with Lizzie together. He disguises himself as Rogue Riderhood and almost succeeds in drowning Wrayburn. After Riderhood realises that Headstone is impersonating him to incriminate him for Wrayburn's murder, he attempts to blackmail Headstone, and this leads to a fight, and both men drowning in the river. Described repeatedly as \"decent\" and \"constrained\",<ref name=Dickens1989ed /> Headstone's personality splits between \"painfully respectable\"<ref name=\"Collins, Philip 1968\">{{cite book |last=Collins |first=Philip |title=Dickens and Crime |url=https://archive.org/details/dickenscrime00coll |url-access=registration |location=Bloomington |publisher=Indiana University Press |year=1968}}</ref> and \"wild jealousy\", with a \"passion terrible in its violence\".<ref name=\"Collins, Philip 1964\">{{cite book |last=Collins |first=Philip |title=Dickens and Education |location=New York |publisher=St Martin's Press |year=1964}}</ref> He is presented by Dickens as an animal in the night and a respectable, \"mechanical\"<ref name=\"Romano, John 1978\"/> schoolteacher during the day. A possible explanation for this dichotomy may be Headstone's \"intellectual insecurity\",<ref name=\"Collins, Philip 1964\"/> that manifests itself in violence after Lizzie's rejection.  The \"most complex of Dickens's villain-murderers are presented as such double-figures\".<ref name=\"Collins, Philip 1968\"/> Dickens here demonstrates the way identity can be manipulated. Headstone also serves as a foil to Wrayburn, and his evil nature antagonizes Wrayburn, as much as Lizzie's goodness helps him.\n* '''Silas Wegg''' \u2013 is ballad-seller with a wooden leg. He is a \"social parasite\",<ref name=Ihara1998 /> hired to read for the Boffins and teach Mr Boffin how to read, despite not being entirely literate himself. Wegg finds Harmon's will in the dust heaps, and he and Venus attempt to use it to blackmail the Boffins. He wishes to buy back his own leg as soon as he has the money, which is an attempt to \"complete himself\".<ref name=\"Thurley, Geoffrey 1976\"/> Wegg claims to want the leg so that he can be seen as respectable. Some critics find the juxtaposition of Wegg's villainy and his sense of humour to be inconsistent.\n* '''Mr Venus''' \u2013 a [[taxidermist]] and articulator of bones, who is in love with Pleasant Riderhood, whom he eventually marries. He meets Silas Wegg after having procured his amputated leg and he pretends to join Silas in blackmailing Mr Boffin regarding Harmon's will, while really informing Boffin of Silas's scheme. Dickens is said to have based Mr. Venus on a real taxidermist named J Willis, although Venus's \"defining obsession\" renders him \"among Dickens's most outlandish, least realistic\" characters.<ref name=\"Romano, John 1978\"/>\n* '''Mr Alfred Lammle''' \u2013 is married to Sophronia Lammle. Both of them, at the time of their marriage, were under the false impression that the other was fairly wealthy. Subsequently, they are forced to use their overabundance of charm and superficiality in attempts to make influential acquaintances and gain money through them.\n* '''Mrs Sophronia Lammle''' \u2013 is described, early in the novel, as \"the mature young lady\" and a proper young woman. However, this turns out to be ironic as she is later shown to be greedy, cold, and manipulative. She married Alfred Lammle because she believed he had money, and when it turned out he did not, the two of them formed a partnership that involves swindling money from others. They, for example, conspire to trap Georgiana Podsnap in a marriage with Fledgeby, though Sophronia repents before this plan can come to fruition, and arranges for Twemlow to inform the Podsnaps without her husband's knowledge.\n* '''Georgiana Podsnap''' \u2013 a daughter of Mr and Mrs Podsnap, who  is very sheltered, shy, trusting and na\u00efve. because of this she is taken advantage of by more manipulative upper-class characters, such as Fledgeby and the Lammles, who scheme to \"befriend\" her and take her money. She is courted by Fledgeby, through Alfred Lammle, although not with honourable intentions, and nearly finds herself trapped in a marriage with Fledgeby until Sophronia Lammle suffers a change of heart.\n* '''Mr Fledgeby''' \u2013 called ''Fascination Fledgeby'' is a friend of the Lammles. He owns Mr Riah's moneylending business and is greedy and corrupt and makes his money through speculation. He provides a contrast with Mr Riah's gentleness, and underlines the point that \"a Jew may be kindly and a Christian cruel\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Dark |first=Sidney |author-link=Sidney Dark |url=https://archive.org/stream/charlesdickens00darkuoft/charlesdickens00darkuoft_djvu.txt |title=Charles Dickens |publisher=T Nelson & Sons |year=1919 |accessdate=16 April 2009}}</ref> Fledgeby nearly marries Georgiana Podsnap to gain access to her money, but Sophronia Lammle backs out of the scheme and, once Fledgeby is no longer allied with the Lammles, they seek him out and beat him.\n* '''Roger \"Rogue\" Riderhood''' \u2013 \"Gaffer\" Hexam's partner until Gaffer rejects him when he is convicted of theft. In revenge for that slight he falsely turns Gaffer in as the murderer of John Harmon, in the hope of receiving a reward. Later, Riderhood becomes a lock-keeper, and Headstone attempts to frame him for the murder of Eugene Wrayburn. After attempts to blackmail Headstone, the two men fall in the river Thames during a fight and both drown. In his \"literally irredeemable villainy\",<ref name=\"Romano, John 1978\"/> Riderhood represents an opportunistic character who will change his behaviour according to whatever suits his needs best at any given moment.\n* '''Reginald \"Rumty\" Wilfer''' \u2013 is Bella Wilfer's doting father, who is gentle, innocent, fatherly, and kindly, despite his querulous wife and daughter and thankless work as a clerk. Dickens describes him in almost childish terms, and he is often called \"the Cherub\".\n\n===Minor characters===\n* '''Mr Inspector''' \u2013 a police officer, who acts as a witness to several important events, such as when the corpse from the river is mistakenly identified as John Harmon, when Gaffer Hexam is taken into custody, and when the real John Harmon is named.<ref name=\"Hawes, Donald 1998\"/> In general, he is \"imperturbable, omnicompetent, firm but genial, and an accomplished actor\",<ref name=\"Collins, Philip 1968\"/> who commands authority. However he is not particularly effective in his administration of the law, and this leads to doubt about the justice system in the novel.\n* '''Mr John Podsnap''' \u2013 a pompous man of the upper middle class, married to Mrs Podsnap and the father of Georgiana, who is smug and jingoistic. Some critics believe that Dickens used Podsnap to satirise [[John Forster (biographer)|John Forster]], Dickens's lifelong friend and official biographer. However, Dickens insisted he only used some of Forster's mannerisms for this character, who was in no way to represent his closest friend. Forster, like Dickens, rose with difficulty from an impoverished middle-class background.<ref name=Ackroyd1991>{{cite book |last=Ackroyd |first=Peter |author-link=Peter Ackroyd |title=Dickens |location=New York |publisher=Harper-Collins |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-06-016602-1 |url=https://archive.org/details/dickens00ackr_1 }}</ref> The character of Podsnap was used to represent the views of \"Society,\" as shown in his disapproval of Lizzie Hexam and Eugene Wrayburn's marriage.<ref name=Ihara1998 />\n* '''Mrs Podsnap''' \u2013 the mother of Georgiana Podsnap. Though she embodies the materialistic ideals of her husband and daughter, Mrs Podsnap is the least prominent of the family. She is described as a \"fine woman\"<ref name=Dickens1989ed /> in her embodiment of the typical upper-class wife.\n* '''Mrs Wilfer''' \u2013 Bella's mother, a woman who is never satisfied with what she has. Her haughtiness is apparent in the way she acts at the Boffins's home and when Bella and Rokesmith return after their wedding. Her animosity towards her husband, her greed and discontent contrast with her husband's good nature and provide an image of what Bella could become, should she not change.\n* '''Lavinia Wilfer''' \u2013 Bella's younger sister and George Sampson's fianc\u00e9e. Vocal and opinionated, she is the only character who will stand up to Mrs Wilfer by matching her derisiveness and audacity. In some ways, she acts as a foil to Bella, and while Bella overcomes her desire for money and appreciates other aspects of life, Lavinia remains resentful in her poverty.\n* '''George Sampson''' \u2013 Lavinia Wilfer's suitor, who was originally in love with Bella. He provides comic relief and a contrast with the idyllic relationship between Bella and Rokesmith/Harmon.\n* '''Mr Melvin Twemlow''' \u2013 the well-connected friend of the Veneerings, who is often cultivated for his supposed influence with powerful people, such as Lord Snigsworth. Mrs Lammle tells him about their plot to marry Georgiana Podsnap and Fledgeby, to whom Twemlow owes money. Though Twemlow is introduced as being as insensible as a table at the Veneerings' dinner party, he comes to reflect a wise way of thinking. His wearing of a collar and cravat creates \"picturesque and archaic\" impression,<ref name=\"Romano, John 1978\"/> and he proves himself a \"true gentleman in his response to Wrayburn's marriage\".<ref name=\"Romano, John 1978\"/>\n* '''Mrs Betty Higden''' \u2013 a child-minder, who takes in poor children and cares for them, including Johnny, the orphan whom the Boffins plan to adopt before he dies in the children's hospital. She is old and poor, and portrayed sympathetically as pitiable. She is so terrified of dying in the workhouse that, when she begins to grow sick, she runs away to the country and ends up dying in Lizzie Hexam's arms. Mrs Higden draws readers' attention to the miserable lives led by the poor, and the need for social reform.\n* '''Johnny''' \u2013 the orphan great-grandson of Betty Higden. The Boffins plan on adopting Johnny, but he dies in the Children's Hospital before they are able to do so.\n* '''Sloppy''' \u2013 a foundling who assists Betty Higden in taking care of children. Raised in the workhouse, he has a learning disability, but is nevertheless adept at reading the newspaper for Mrs. Higden. He is portrayed as inherently innocent because of his disability, and carts away Wegg at the end of the novel. \n* '''Jesse \"Gaffer\" Hexam''' \u2013 a waterman and the father of Lizzie and Charley, who makes a living by robbing corpses found in the river Thames. His former partner, Rogue Riderhood, turns him in for the murder of John Harmon after Harmon's body is supposedly dragged from the river. A search is mounted to find and arrest Gaffer, but he is discovered dead in his boat. Gaffer's opposition to education prompts Lizzie to sneak Charley away to school, though she stays with her father. As a result, Gaffer disowns Charley as a son. In a sense, Gaffer predicted the alienating effect education would have on Charley.\n* '''Pleasant Riderhood''' \u2013 the daughter of Rogue Riderhood, who works in a pawn shop, and, like Jenny Wren and Lizzie Hexam, is another daughter caring for her abusive father as though he were her child, and who, in vain, tries to steer him along the path of right.<ref name=\"Adrian, Arthur A 1984\">{{cite book |last=Adrian |first=Arthur A |title=Dickens and the Parent-Child Relationship |url=https://archive.org/details/dickensparentchi0000adri |url-access=registration |location= Athens |publisher=Ohio University Press |year=1984 |isbn=978-0821407356}}</ref><ref name=\"Slater, Michael 1983\">{{cite book |last=Slater |first=Michael |title=Dickens and Women |location=Stanford |publisher=Stanford University Press |year=1983 |isbn=9780804711807}}</ref> She eventually marries Mr. Venus.\n* '''Mr and Mrs Veneering''' \u2013 a nouveaux-riches husband and wife whose main preoccupation is to advance in the social world. They invite influential people to their dinner parties where their furniture gleams with a sheen that they also put on to make themselves seem more impressive. They \"wear\" their acquaintances, their possessions, and their wealth like jewellery, in an attempt to impress those around them. Veneering eventually goes bankrupt and they retire to France to live on the jewels he bought for his wife.\n* '''Miss Abbey Potterson''' \u2013 mistress of the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters, she keeps the inn respectable, and only allows patrons to drink as much as she sees fit. She is likened, humorously, to a schoolmistress, linking her to the novel's concern with education.<ref>{{cite book |last=Schlicke |first=Paul |title=Dickens and Popular Entertainment |location=London |isbn=9780044451808 |publisher=Unwin Hyman |year=1988}}</ref>\n* '''Miss Peecher''' \u2013 a school teacher who is in love with Bradley Headstone. She is a \"good and harmless\" character, though she displays an \"addiction to rules and forms\".<ref name=\"Romano, John 1978\"/> In addition, she shows a \"naive confidence in the outward appearance of things\",<ref name=\"Romano, John 1978\"/> as demonstrated by her love of Headstone, a villain who gives the impression of being good.\n* '''Mr Dolls''' \u2013 Jenny Wren's alcoholic father. Jenny calls him her \"bad child\", and treats him accordingly.<ref name=\"Adrian, Arthur A 1984\"/><ref name=\"Slater, Michael 1983\"/> His real name is not known to Eugene, so Eugene calls him \"Mr Dolls\". As his daughter is really named Fanny Cleaver, his name might be Mr. Cleaver, but he is never called by a name other than \"my bad child\", or \"Mr Dolls\" in the novel.\n* '''George Radfoot''' - third mate on the ship bringing John Harmon back to England, whose dead body, found in the river by Gaffer Hexam, is identified as being Harmon, because of the papers found in his pockets. He had been involved in crimes and schemes with Riderhood, who most likely was responsible for trying to kill Harmon and killing Radfoot.\n\n==Plot summary==\nHaving made his fortune from London's rubbish, a rich misanthropic miser dies, estranged from all except his faithful employees Mr and Mrs Boffin. By his will, his fortune goes to his estranged son John Harmon, who is to return from where he has settled abroad (possibly in South Africa) to claim it, on condition that he marries a woman he has never met, Miss Bella Wilfer. The implementation of the will is in the charge of the solicitor, Mortimer Lightwood, who has no other practice.\n\nThe son and heir does not appear, though some knew him aboard the ship to London. A body is found in the Thames by Gaffer Hexam, rowed by his daughter Lizzie. He is a waterman who makes his living by retrieving corpses and taking the cash in their pockets, before handing them over to the authorities. Papers in the pockets of the drowned man identify him as the heir, John Harmon. Present at the identification of the water-soaked corpse is a mysterious young man, who gives his name as Julius Handford and then disappears.\n\nBy the terms of the miser's will, the whole estate then devolves upon Mr and Mrs Boffin, na\u00efve and good-hearted people who wish to enjoy it for themselves and to share it with others. They take the disappointed bride of the drowned heir, Miss Wilfer, into their household, and treat her as their pampered child and heiress. They also accept an offer from Julius Handford, now going under the name of John Rokesmith, to serve as their confidential secretary and man of business, at no salary. Rokesmith uses this position to watch and learn everything about the Boffins, Miss Wilfer, and the aftershock of the drowning of the heir John Harmon. Mr Boffin engages a one-legged ballad-seller, Silas Wegg, to read aloud to him in the evenings, and Wegg tries to take advantage of his position and of Mr Boffin's good heart to obtain other advantages from the wealthy [[dustman]]. When the Boffins purchase a large home, Wegg is invited to live in the old Harmon home. Wegg hopes to find hidden treasure in the house or in the mounds of trash on the property.\n\nGaffer Hexam, who found the body, is accused of murdering John Harmon by a fellow-waterman, Roger \"Rogue\" Riderhood, who is bitter at having been cast off as Hexam's partner on the river, and who covets the large reward offered in relation to the murder. As a result of the accusation, Hexam is shunned by his fellows on the river, and excluded from The Six Jolly Fellowship-Porters, the public house they frequent. Hexam's young son, the clever but priggish Charley Hexam, leaves his father's house to better himself at school, and to train to be a schoolmaster, encouraged by his sister, the beautiful Lizzie Hexam. Lizzie stays with her father, to whom she is devoted.\n\nBefore Riderhood can claim the reward for his false allegation against Hexam, Hexam is found drowned himself. Lizzie Hexam becomes the lodger of a doll's dressmaker, a disabled teenager nicknamed \"Jenny Wren\". Jenny's alcoholic father lives with them, and is treated by Jenny as a child. Lizzie has caught the eye of the work-shy barrister, Eugene Wrayburn, who first noticed her when accompanying his friend Mortimer Lightwood to the home of Gaffer Hexam. Wrayburn falls in love with her. However, he soon gains a violent rival in Bradley Headstone, the schoolmaster of Charley Hexam. Charley wants his sister to be under obligation to no one but him, and tries to arrange lessons for her with Headstone, only to find that Wrayburn has already engaged a teacher for both Lizzie and Jenny. Headstone quickly becomes attracted to Lizzie, with unreasonable passion, and makes an unsuccessful proposal. Angered by being refused and by Wrayburn's dismissive attitude towards him, Headstone comes to see him as the source of all his misfortunes, and takes to following him around the streets of London at night. Lizzie fears Headstone's threats to Wrayburn and is unsure of Wrayburn's intentions toward her. (Wrayburn admits to Lightwood that he does not know his own intentions yet, either.) She flees both men, getting work up-river from London.\n\nMr and Mrs Boffin attempt to adopt a young orphan, in the care of his great-grandmother, Betty Higden, but the boy dies before the adoption can proceed. Mrs Higden minds children for a living, assisted by a foundling known as Sloppy. She has a terror of the workhouse. When Lizzie Hexam finds Mrs Higden dying, she meets the Boffins and Bella Wilfer. In the meantime Eugene Wrayburn has obtained information about Lizzie's whereabouts from Jenny's father and finds the object of his affections. Bradley Headstone engages with Riderhood, now working as a lock-keeper, as Headstone is consumed with making good his threats about Wrayburn. After following Wrayburn up river and seeing him with Lizzie, Headstone attacks Wrayburn and leaves him for dead. Lizzie finds him in the river and rescues him. Wrayburn, thinking he will die anyway, marries Lizzie, and suppresses any hint that Headstone was his attacker to save her reputation. When he survives, he is glad that this has brought him into a loving marriage, albeit with a social inferior. He had not cared about the social gulf between them but Lizzie had and would not otherwise have married him.\n\nRokesmith is in love with Bella Wilfer but she cannot bear to accept him, having insisted that she will marry only for money. Mr Boffin appears to be corrupted by his wealth and becomes a miser. He also begins to treat his secretary Rokesmith with contempt and cruelty. This arouses the sympathy of Bella Wilfer, and she stands up for Rokesmith when Mr Boffin dismisses him for aspiring to marry her. They marry and live happily, in relatively poor circumstances. Bella soon conceives.\n\nMeanwhile, Bradley Headstone tries to put the blame for his assault on Wrayburn onto Rogue Riderhood, by dressing in similar clothes when doing the deed and then putting his own clothes in the river. Riderhood fetches the bundle of clothing and attempts to blackmail Headstone. Headstone is overcome with the hopelessness of his situation, as Wrayburn is alive, recovering from the brutal beating, and is married to Lizzie. Confronted by Riderhood in his classroom, Headstone is seized with a self-destructive urge, proceeding to the lock, where he flings himself into the lock, pulling Riderhood with him so that both are drowned.\n\nThe one-legged parasite Silas Wegg has, with help from Mr Venus, an \"articulator of bones\", searched the mounds of dust and discovered a will subsequent to the one which has given the Boffins the whole of the Harmon estate. By the later will, the estate goes to the Crown. Wegg decides to blackmail Boffin with this will, but Venus has second thoughts and reveals all to Boffin.\n\nIt has gradually become clear to the reader that John Rokesmith is the missing heir, John Harmon. He had been drugged and dumped in the river by Riderhood, who gave the same treatment to Harmon's shipmate. Harmon survived the attempted murder, done to rob him of the money he had from the sale of his business. The switch of clothes between the two men was done by Harmon to have a chance to learn about the girl before claiming his inheritance; the shipmate agreed with the intention of the theft of Harmon's cash, but Riderhood took it all. Rokesmith/Harmon has been maintaining his alias to try to win  Bella Wilfer without the force of the will and the wealth. Now that she has married him, believing him to be poor, he can throw off his disguise. He does so and it is revealed that Mr Boffin's apparent miserliness and ill-treatment of his secretary were part of a scheme to test Bella's motives about money.\n\nWhen Wegg attempts to clinch his blackmail on the basis of the later will disinheriting Boffin, Boffin turns the tables by revealing a still later will by which the fortune is granted to Boffin even at young John Harmon's expense. The Boffins are determined to make John Harmon and his bride Bella Wilfer their heirs anyway so all ends well, except for the villain Wegg, who is carted away by Sloppy. Sloppy himself becomes friendly with Jenny Wren, whose father has died.\n\nA sub-plot involves the activities of the devious Mr and Mrs Lammle, a couple who have married one another for money to live in society, only to discover that neither has any money. They attempt to obtain financial advantage by pairing off their acquaintance, Fledgeby, first with the heiress Georgiana Podsnap and later with Bella Wilfer. Fledgeby is an extortioner and money-lender, who uses the kindly old Jew, Riah, as his cover, temporarily causing Riah to fall out with his friend and prot\u00e9g\u00e9e Jenny Wren. Eventually, all attempts at improving their financial situation having failed, the Lammles leave England, Mr Lammle having first administered a sound beating to Fledgeby.\n\n==Original publication==\n''Our Mutual Friend'', like most Dickens novels, was published in 19 monthly instalments, each costing one shilling (with the exception of the nineteenth, which was double-length and cost two).

With regard to this the influence of the family is important. In many of Dickens's novels, including ''Our Mutual Friend'' and ''[[Little Dorrit]]'', parents try to force their children into arranged marriages.<ref name=\"California Press 1967\"/> John Harmon, for example, was supposed to marry Bella to suit the conditions of his father's will, and though initially, he refused to marry her for that reason. However, he later married her for love. Harmon goes against his father's wishes in another way by taking the alias of John Rokesmith he refuses his inheritance.<ref name=\"California Press 1967\"/> Bella is also swayed by the influence of her parents. Her mother wishes her to marry for money to better the fortunes of the entire family, although her father is happy with her marrying John Rokesmith for love. Bella's marriage to Rokesmith goes against what is expected of her by her mother, but eventually her mother accepts the fact that Bella has at least married someone who will make her happy. However, later on in the novel, Bella accepts the everyday duties of a wife, and seemingly gives up her independence.<ref name=Shuman1995>{{cite journal |last=Shuman |first=Cathy |title=Invigilating Our Mutual Friend: Gender and the Legitimation of Professional Authority |journal=Novel: A Forum on Fiction |volume=28 |issue=2 |date=Winter 1995 |pages=154\u2013172  |jstor=1345509 |publisher=Duke University Press |doi=10.2307/1345509 }}</ref> Yet she refuses to be the \"doll in the doll's house\";<ref name=Dickens1989ed /> and is not content with being a wife who rarely leaves her home without her husband. Furthermore, Bella reads up on the current events so that she can discuss them with her husband, and is actively involved in all of the couple's important decisions.\n\nLizzie Hexam also objects to the expectation of marriage to Eugene Wrayburn, because she sees the difference in their social class status. Without marriage, their connection risks her reputation. She does not aspire to marrying Wrayburn even though she loves him and would be elevated in society simply by marrying him, which almost any woman would have done at the time.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Lizzie feels that she is unworthy of him. Wrayburn, however, feels that he is unworthy of such a good woman. He also knows that his father would disapprove of her low social status.<ref name=\"California Press 1967\"/> She goes against expectations when she refuses to marry Bradley Headstone. He would have been an excellent match for her by social class, according to norms of the time, however, Lizzie does not love him.<ref name=\"California Press 1967\"/> She unselfishly does what others expect of her, like helping Charley escape their father to go to school, and living with Jenny Wren. Marrying Wrayburn is the only truly selfish act Lizzie commits in ''Our Mutual Friend'', out of her love for him, when he made up his mind to ask her.\n\n===Status of women===\nBecause of the rapid increase in wealth generated by the Industrial Revolution, women gained power through their households and class positions. It was up to the women in Victorian society to display their family's rank by decorating their households. This directly influenced the man's business and class status. Upper-class homes were ornate, as well as packed full of materials,<ref name=Langland1992290 /> so that \"A lack of clutter was to be considered in bad taste.\" Through handcrafts and home improvement, women asserted their power over the household: \"The making of a true home is really our peculiar and inalienable right: a right, which no man can take from us; for a man can no more make a home than a drone can make a hive\" (Frances Cobbe).<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://jdh.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/19/1/11 |title=Home is where the Art is |first=Clive |last=Edwards |journal=Journal of Design History |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=11\u201321 |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1 March 2006 |accessdate=8 April 2018|doi=10.1093/jdh/epk002 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/agunn/teaching/enl3251/vf/pres/romanski.html ''Upper Class Victorian Homes.''

In 1854, the ''[[Jewish Chronicle]]'' had asked why \"Jews alone should be excluded from the 'sympathizing heart' of this great author and powerful friend of the oppressed.\" Dickens (who had extensive knowledge of London street life and child exploitation) explained that he had made Fagin Jewish because \"it unfortunately was true, of the time to which the story refers, that that class of criminal almost invariably was a Jew\".<ref name=\"Oliver Twist intro\">{{Cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R63Gk3ntfFkC&lpg=PR19|title=Oliver Twist \u2013 introduction |last=Howe|first=Irving |publisher=Random House Publishing Group |year=2005 |isbn=9780553901566}}</ref> Dickens commented that by calling Fagin a Jew he had meant no imputation against the Jewish faith, saying in a letter, \"I have no feeling towards the Jews but a friendly one.

These manuals served as another method to distinguish oneself by social class. Etiquette books specifically targeted members of the middle and upper classes, and it was not until 1897 that a manual, specifically ''Book of the Household'', by Casell, addressed all the classes. Not only did the readership of etiquette manuals show class differences, but the practices prescribed within them became a way by which a member of the lower class could be identified.<ref name=Langland1992>{{cite journal |jstor=462641 |last=Langland |first=Elizabeth |title=Nobody's Angels: Domestic Ideology and Middle-Class Women in the Victorian Novel |journal=Modern Language Association |volume=107 |pages=290\u2013304 |number=2 |date=March 1992 |doi=10.2307/462641 }}</ref>\n\nMost etiquette manuals addressed such things as calling cards, the duration of the call, and what was acceptable to say and do during a visit. One of the most popular etiquette books was [[Isabella Beeton]]'s [[Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management|''Book of Household Management'']], which was published in 1861. In this book, Beeton claims that a call of fifteen to twenty minutes is \"quite sufficient\" and states, \"A lady paying a visit may remove her boa or neckerchief; but neither her shawl nor bonnet.\"<ref name=Langland1992 /> Beeton goes on to write, \"Of course no absorbed subject was ever spoken about.

Water is seen as a sign of new life, and associated with the Christian sacrament of [[Baptism]]. Characters like John Harmon and Eugene Wrayburn end up in the river, and come out reborn. Wrayburn emerges from the river close to death, but is ready to marry Lizzie, and to avoid naming his attacker to save her reputation. He surprises everyone, including himself, when he survives and goes on to have a loving marriage with Lizzie. John Harmon also appears to end up in the river through no fault of his own, and when Gaffer pulls his \"body\" out of the waters, he adopts the alias of John Rokesmith. This alias is for his own safety and peace of mind; he wants to know that he can do things on his own, and does not need his father's name or money to make a good life for himself.<ref name=\"California Press 1967\">Dabney, Ross H. ''Love & Property in the Novels of Dickens''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1967.</ref>\n\nDickens uses many images that relate to water. Phrases such as the \"depths and shallows of Podsnappery,\"<ref name=Dickens1989ed /> and the \"time had come for flushing and flourishing this man down for good\",<ref name=Dickens1989ed /> are examples of such imagery. Some critics see this as being used excessively<ref>{{cite journal |jstor=29533733|last=Reed |first=John R |title=The Riches of Redundancy: Our Mutual Friend |journal=Studies in the Novel |volume=38 |number=1 |date=Spring 2006 |pages=15\u201335 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press }}</ref>\n\n==Themes==\nAside from examining the novel's form and characters, modern critics of ''Our Mutual Friend'' have focused on identifying and analysing what they perceive as the main themes of the novel. Although Stanley Friedman's 1973 essay \"The Motif of Reading in ''Our Mutual Friend''\" emphasises references to literacy and illiteracy in the novel, Friedman states, \"Money, the dust-heaps, and the river have been seen as the main symbols, features, that help develop such themes as avarice, predation, death and rebirth, the quest for identity and pride. To these images and ideas, we may add what Monroe Engel calls the 'social themes of ''Our Mutual Friend''\u2014having to do with money-dust, and relatedly with the treatment of the poor, education, representative government, even the inheritance laws.'\"<ref name=Friedman1973>{{cite journal |first=Stanley |last=Friedman |title=The Motif of Reading in ''Our Mutual Friend'' |journal=Nineteenth-Century Fiction |volume=28 |number=1 |date=June 1973 |page=39 |accessdate=10 April 2018 |url=http://ncl.ucpress.edu/content/28/1/38}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Metz, many of the prominent themes in Dickens's earlier works of fiction are intricately woven into Dickens's last novel. She states, \"Like ''[[David Copperfield (novel)|David Copperfield]]'', ''Our Mutual Friend'' is about the relationship between work and the realization of self, about the necessity to be 'useful' before one can be 'happy.' Like ''[[Great Expectations]]'', it is about the power of money to corrupt those who place their faith in its absolute value. Like ''[[Bleak House]]'', it is about the legal, bureaucratic, and social barriers that intervene between individuals and their nearest neighbours. Like all of Dickens's novels, and especially the later ones, it is about pervasive social problems\u2014poverty, disease, class bitterness, the sheer ugliness and vacuity of contemporary life.\"<ref name=Metz1979 />\n\n==Literary significance and criticism==\n===Contemporary critics of Dickens===\nAt the time of its original serial publication, ''Our Mutual Friend'' was not regarded as one of Dickens's greatest successes, and on average fewer than 30,000 copies of each instalment was sold.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://omf.ucsc.edu/publication/comp-and-pub.html |first=Robert L |last=Patten  |title=The Composition, Publication, and Reception of ''Our Mutual Friend'' |journal=Our Mutual Friend, the Scholarly Pages |accessdate=8 April 2009 |location=Santa Cruz, California |publisher=University of California}}</ref> Though ''The New York Times'', of 22 November 1865,  conjectured, \"By most readers...the last work by Dickens will be considered his best,\"<ref name=\"New Books 1865\">{{cite news |author=Staff |title=New Books |newspaper=The New York Times |date=22 November 1865}}</ref> direct evidence of how readers responded to Dickens's novels is scarce.

Dallas]] felt that ''Our Mutual Friend'' was perfect. Rather, the oft acknowledged \"genius\" of Dickens seems to have overshadowed all reviews and made it impossible for most critics to completely condemn the work, the majority of these reviews being a mixture of praise and disparagement.\n\nIn November 1865 [[E.S. Dallas]], in ''The Times'', lauded ''Our Mutual Friend'' as \"one of the best of even Dickens's tales,\"<ref>Dallas, E S, Review, ''The Times'' 29 November 1865 quoted in  {{cite book |title=Dickens: The Critical Heritage |editor-first=Philip |editor-last=Collins |location=New York |publisher=Barnes & Noble |year=1971 |pages=464}}</ref> but was unable to ignore the flaws. \"This last novel of Mr Charles Dickens, really one of his finest works, and one in which on occasion he even surpasses himself, labours under the disadvantage of a beginning that drags ...

The article asks: \"Do men live by finding the bodies of the drowned, and landing them ashore 'with their pockets allus inside out' for the sake of the reward offered for their recovery? As far as we can make out, no. We have been at some trouble to inquire from men who should know; watermen, who have lived on the river nigh all their lives, if they have seen late at night a dark boat with a solitary occupant, drifting down the river on the 'look out,' plying his frightful trade?

His fancy, his pathos, his humour, his wonderful powers of observation, his picturesqueness, and his versatility, are as remarkable now as they were twenty years ago.\"<ref name=UnsignedOct1865>Unsigned Review, ''London Review'', 28 October 1865, quoted in   {{cite book |title=Dickens: The Critical Heritage |editor-first=Philip |editor-last=Collins |location=New York |publisher=Barnes & Noble |year=1971 |pages=454}}</ref> But like other critics, after praising the book this same critic then turned around and disparaged it: \"Not that we mean to say Mr Dickens has outgrown his faults. They are as obvious as ever\u2014sometimes even trying our patience rather hard. A certain extravagance in particular scenes and persons\u2014a tendency to caricature and grotesqueness\u2014and a something here and there which savours of the melodramatic, as if the author had been considering how the thing would 'tell' on the stage\u2014are to be found in ''Our Mutual Friend'', as in all this great novelist's productions.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nEdwin Whipple in 1867 also commented on the sentiment and pathos of Dickens's characters, stating, \"But the poetical, the humorous, the tragic, or the pathetic element is never absent in Dickens's characterization, to make his delineations captivating to the heart and imagination, and give the reader a sense of having escaped from whatever in the actual world is dull and wearisome.\"<ref>Whipple, Edwin P, \"The Genius of Dickens\", ''Atlantic Monthly'' May 1867 pp 546\u201354 quoted in   {{cite book |title=Dickens: The Critical Heritage |editor-first=Philip |editor-last=Collins |location=New York |publisher=Barnes & Noble |year=1971 |pages=482}}</ref>\n\nHowever, in 1869 [[George Stott (missionary)|George Stott]] condemned Dickens for being overly sentimental: \"Mr Dickens's pathos we can only regard as a complete and absolute failure. It is unnatural and unlovely. He attempts to make a stilted phraseology, and weak and sickly sentimentality do duty for genuine emotion.\"<ref>Stott, George, \"Charles Dickens\", ''Contemporary Review'' January 1869, pp 203\u201325 quoted in   {{cite book |title=Dickens: The Critical Heritage |editor-first=Philip |editor-last=Collins |location=New York |publisher=Barnes & Noble |year=1971 |pages=497}}</ref> Still, in the manner of all the other mixed reviews, Stott states that \"we still hold him to be emphatically a man of genius.\"<ref>Stott, George, \"Charles Dickens\", ''Contemporary Review'' January 1869, pp 203\u201325 quoted in   {{cite book |title=Dickens: The Critical Heritage |editor-first=Philip |editor-last=Collins |location=New York |publisher=Barnes & Noble |year=1971 |pages=492\u2013493}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Spectator'' in 1869 concurred with Stott's opinion, writing \"Mr Dickens has brought people to think that there is a sort of piety in being gushing and maudlin,\" and that his works are heavily imbued with the \"most mawkish and unreal sentimentalism\",<ref>Hutton, R H, \"Mr Dickens's Moral Services to Literature\", ''Spectator'' 17 April 1869, pp 474\u20135 quoted in  {{cite book |title=Dickens: The Critical Heritage |editor-first=Philip |editor-last=Collins |location=New York |publisher=Barnes & Noble |year=1971 |pages=490}}</ref> but the unsigned critic still maintained that Dickens was one of the great authors of his time.<ref name=UnsignedOct1865 />\n\n===Later literary criticism===\n[[G. K. Chesterton]], one of Dickens's critics in the early 20th century, expressed the opinion that Mr Boffin's pretended fall into miserliness was originally intended by Dickens to be authentic, but that Dickens ran out of time and so took refuge in the awkward pretence that Boffin had been acting. Chesterton argues that while we might believe Boffin could be corrupted, we can hardly believe he could keep up such a strenuous pretence of corruption: \"Such a character as his\u2014rough, simple and lumberingly unconscious\u2014might be more easily conceived as really sinking in self-respect and honour than as keeping up, month after month, so strained and inhuman a theatrical performance. ... It might have taken years to turn Noddy Boffin into a [[miser]]; but it would have taken centuries to turn him into an actor.\"<ref name=Chesterton>{{cite web |url=https://omf.ucsc.edu/scholarship/bibliography/chesterton-text.html|title=Our Mutual Friend |last=Chesterton |first=G K |accessdate=6 April 2018 |work=Our Mutual Friend: The Scholarly Pages |location=Santa Cruz, California }}</ref> However, Chesterton also praised the book as being a return to Dickens's youthful optimism and creative exuberance, full of characters who \"have that great Dickens quality of being something which is pure farce and yet which is not superficial; an unfathomable farce\u2014a farce that goes down to the roots of the universe.\"<ref name=Chesterton />\n\nIn his 1940 article \"Dickens: Two Scrooges\", [[Edmund Wilson]] states, \"''Our Mutual Friend,'' like all these later books of Dickens, is more interesting to us today than it was to Dickens's public.

Although some modern critics find Dickens's characterisation in ''Our Mutual Friend'' problematic, most tend to positively acknowledge the novel's complexity and appreciate its multiple plot lines.\n\nIn November 2019, the ''[[BBC News]]'' listed ''Our Mutual Friend'' on its list of the [[BBC list of 100 'most inspiring' novels|100 most influential novels]].<ref name=Bbc2019-11-05/>\n\n====Form and plot====\nIn his 2006 article \"The Richness of Redundancy: ''Our Mutual Friend,''\" John R Reed states, \"''Our Mutual Friend'' has not pleased many otherwise satisfied readers of Dickens's fiction. For his contemporaries and such acute assessors of fiction as Henry James, the novel seemed to lack structure, among other faults. More recently, critics have discovered ways in which Dickens can be seen experimenting in the novel.\"<ref name=Reed200615>{{cite journal |jstor=29533733|last=Reed |first=John R |title=The Riches of Redundancy: Our Mutual Friend |journal=Studies in the Novel |volume=38 |pages=15\u201335 |number=1 |date=Spring 2006 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press }}</ref> Reed maintains that Dickens's establishment of \"an incredibly elaborate structure\" for ''Our Mutual Friend'' was an extension of Dickens's quarrel with realism. In creating a highly formal structure for his novel, which called attention to the novel's own language, Dickens embraced taboos of realism. Reed also argues that Dickens's employment of his characteristic technique of offering his reader what might be seen as a surplus of information within the novel, in the form of a pattern of references, exists as a way for Dickens to guarantee that the meaning of his novel might be transmitted to his reader. Reed cites Dickens's multiple descriptions of the River Thames and repetitive likening of Gaffer to \"a roused bird of prey\" in the novel's first chapter as evidence of Dickens's use of redundancy to establish two of the novel's fundamental themes: preying/scavenging and the transformative powers of water. According to Reed, to notice and interpret the clues representing the novel's central themes that Dickens gives his reader, the reader must have a surplus of these clues. Echoing Reed's sentiments, in her 1979 article \"The Artistic Reclamation of Waste in ''Our Mutual Friend'',\" Nancy Aycock Metz claims, \"The reader is thrown back upon his own resources. He must suffer, along with the characters of the novel, from the climate of chaos and confusion, and like them, he must begin to make connections and impose order on the details he observes.\"<ref name=Metz1979>{{cite journal |first=Nancy Aycock |last=Metz |title=The Artistic Reclamation of Waste in ''Our Mutual Friend'' |journal=Nineteenth-Century Fiction |volume=34 |number=1 |date=June 1979 |page=62 |publisher=University of California Press |jstor=2933598}}</ref>\n\nIn his 1995 article \"The Cup and the Lip and the Riddle of ''Our Mutual Friend''\", Gregg A Hecimovich reaffirms Metz's notion of reading the novel as a process of connection and focuses on what he sees as one of the main aspects of Dickens's narrative: \"a complex working out of the mysteries and idiosyncrasies presented in the novel.\"<ref name=Hecimovich1995>{{cite journal |first=Gregg A |last=Hecimovich |title=The Cup and the Lip and the Riddle of ''Our Mutual Friend |journal=ELH |volume=62 |pages=955\u2013977 |number=4 |date=Winter 1995 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |jstor=30030109|doi=10.1353/elh.1995.0037 }}</ref> Unlike Dickens's contemporary critics, Hecimovich commends Dickens for ''Our Mutual Friend'''s disjunctive, riddle-like structure and manipulation of plots, declaring, \"In a tale about conundrums and questions of identity, divergence of plots is desirable.\"<ref name=Hecimovich1995967>{{cite journal |first=Gregg A |last=Hecimovich |title=The Cup and the Lip and the Riddle of ''Our Mutual Friend. |journal=ELH |volume=62 |number=4 |date=Winter 1995 |page=967 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |jstor=30030109}}</ref> Hecimovich goes on to say that in structuring his last novel as a riddle-game, Dickens challenges conventions of nineteenth-century Victorian England and that the \"sickness\" infecting Dickens's composition of ''Our Mutual Friend'' is that of Victorian society generally, not Dickens himself.\n\n====Characters====\nHarland S Nelson's 1973 article \"Dickens's ''Our Mutual Friend'' and [[Henry Mayhew]]'s ''London Labour and the London Poor''\" examines Dickens's inspiration for two of the novel's working class characters. Nelson asserts that Gaffer Hexam and Betty Higden were potentially modelled after real members of London's working class whom Mayhew interviewed in the 1840s for his nonfiction work ''London Labour and the London Poor.'' Unlike some of Dickens's contemporaries, who regarded the characters in ''Our Mutual Friend'' as unrealistic representations of actual Victorian people, Nelson maintains that London's nineteenth-century working class is authentically depicted through characters such as Gaffer Hexam and Betty Higden.<ref name=Nelson1970>{{cite journal |first=Harland S |last=Nelson |title=Dickens's ''Our Mutual Friend'' and Henry Mayhew's ''London Labour and the London Poor'' |journal=Nineteenth-Century Fiction |volume=24 |number=3 |date=December 1970 |pages=207\u2013222 |publisher=University of California Press |jstor=2932754}}</ref>\n\nWhile novelist [[Henry James]] dismissed the minor characters Jenny Wren, Mr Wegg, and Mr Venus as \"pathetic characters.\" in his 1865 review of the novel, Gregg Hecimovich in 1989 refers to them as \"important riddlers and riddlees.\"<ref name=Hecimovich962>{{cite journal |first=Gregg A |last= Hecimovich |title=The Cup and the Lip and the Riddle of ''Our Mutual Friend.'' |journal=ELH |volume=62 |number=4 |date=Winter 1995 |page=962 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |jstor=30030109}}</ref> Hecimovich suggests that, \"Through the example of his minor characters, Dickens directs his readers to seek, with the chief characters, order and structure out of the apparent disjunctive 'rubbish' in the novel, to analyze and articulate what ails a fallen London...

Also at that time, temporary fishermen began to arrive, and in the 19th century the exploitation of salt mines and guano began.\n\nIn 1871 the Venezuelan president [[Antonio Guzm\u00e1n Blanco]] created by decree the ''Territorio Col\u00f3n'' (Columbus Territory) which included Los Roques and other adjacent islands. The island of Gran Roque was named as the center of territorial government.\n\nAround the year 1886 there is reference to the arrival of inhabitants coming from the nearby Netherlands Antilles, Aruba, Cura\u00e7ao, etc. They left as a legacy some of the exotic names given to some islands or keys (for example Francisqu\u00ed, Madrisqu\u00ed, Krasqu\u00ed, Selesqu\u00ed). The suffix \"qu\u00ed\" corresponds to the English term (and other languages) \"key\", which means key.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century an epidemic of bubonic plague in La Guaira caused the Venezuelan government to authorize the use of the island of Gran Roque as a quarantine site.\n\nIn 1910, the town of Gran Roque began to consolidate with families from [[Margarita Island]], mainly fishermen.\n\nOn July 20, 1938 the islands were integrated into the [[Federal Dependencies of Venezuela]], and it was only on August 8, 1972 when the archipelago was declared a [[Los Roques National Park|national park]].\n[[File:El gran roque.jpg|thumb|El Gran Roque Island]]\nIn 1978 the marine delimitation agreement between Venezuela and the Kingdom of the Netherlands is signed.\n\nIn order to give greater dynamism to its administration and promote the sustainable development of the islands on November 2, 1990, according to Presidential Decree 1214, the figure of the Single Authority of Los Roques Area was created, which would continue as part of the Federal Dependencies but with a special administrative status.\n\nIn October 2011 all the islands of the Los Roques archipelago are integrated to the Miranda Island Territory according to presidential decree 8549 of November 01, 2011, published in the official gazette N\u00b0 39797, a subdivision of the Federal Dependencies with capital in Gran Roque.\n\nIn 2012 the [[Bolivarian Navy of Venezuela]] named a [[Damen Stan Lander 5612]] landing craft after the islands.<ref name=newdelhitimes2018-11-14/>\n\n==Geography==\nThe major islands of the archipelago have an atoll structure, with two external barriers formed by coral communities, and an inner lagoon and sandy shallows.

In 1941, the population was estimated at about 484 people. In 1950 it reached 559, and in 1987 663 permanent inhabitants. According to the Venezuelan census of 2001 1,209 inhabitants were counted. By 2008 it is estimated that the number inhabitants to be around 1,800.\n\nIts growth is limited because of restrictions involving the declaration as a national park in the 1970s. Most of the population is of Margarite\u00f1o origin who came to the islands mainly to engage in fishing. Since the early twentieth century there has been a small influx of foreigners (mostly Italian).\n\n===Climate===\n\nThe climate is warm and dry, with average annual temperature of {{convert|27.3|C|F|1}} in July and August, reaches a maximum of 34 \u00b0, and between September and January are presented occasional rain, with relative humidity 83% annually. Rainfall is {{convert|256.6|mm|2|abbr=on}} / year; minimum {{convert|6.6|mm|2|abbr=on}} (April) and maximum {{convert|52.2|mm|2|abbr=on}} (November).\n\n==Government==\nLos Roques is a Federal Dependency that is administered directly by officials appointed by the central or federal government of Venezuela.\n\nBetween 1990 and 2011 the central government appointed a director for the Single Area Authority (''Autoridad \u00danica de \u00c1rea'') within the Federal Dependencies, but that last year the central government created the figure of the Miranda Insular Territory (''Territorio Insular'') that encompasses not only Los Roques but [[La Orchila]] and [[Las Aves Archipelago]].\n\nThe headquarters of the head of government (''Jefe de Gobierno'') of the insular territory is the island of [[Gran Roque]] to the north of the Los Roques Archipelago.\n\nAdditionally in the island there are dependencies of other public organisms such as Inparques (''National Parks Institute'') since the archipelago is a national park and the National Guard of Venezuela (''Guardia Nacional'').\n\n==Tourism==\n===Infrastructure===\n[[El Gran Roque]] is the only populated island in the group. It has an airport suitable for small or [[STOL]] aircraft, [[Los Roques Airport]]. The airport is controlled from the [[Maiquet\u00eda]] airport on the mainland.\n\nFrom El Gran Roque most visitors that arrive, go to the port and travel to the keys in small boats called \"pe\u00f1eros\" from 9:00 am to 4:00 pm.<ref>http://www.eluniversal.com/guia-turistica/150531/los-roques</ref>\n\n===Attractions===\n[[File:Playa en Los Roques.jpg|thumb|Beach in Los Roques]]\nActivities include fishing ([[bonefish]], [[barracuda]], [[tarpon]], [[Carangidae|jack]], and [[Spanish mackerel]]), birding, [[snorkeling]], diving, paddling, [[windsurfing]], and [[kitesurfing]], and there is a sea turtle research center located on Dos Mosquises. Accommodations include Pez Raton Lodge, a property primarily used to host fishing guests, Posada Mediterraneo, a five-room inn which accommodates non-fishing guests, and dozens more like El Canto de la Ballena and Posada La Gaviota.\n[[File:Alcatraz (Pelecanus occidentalis) de los Roques Venezuela 001.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Brown pelican]]]]\n\n==See also==\n*[[Federal Dependencies of Venezuela]]\n*[[List of national parks of Venezuela]]\n*[[List of marine molluscs of Venezuela]]\n*[[List of Poriferans of Venezuela]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=newdelhitimes2018-11-14>\n{{cite news \n| url = https://www.newdelhitimes.com/us-donated-patrol-boats-to-panamas-servicio-nacional-aeronaval/\n| title = US donated Patrol boats to Panama\u2019s Servicio Nacional Aeronaval\n| work = [[New Delhi Times (newspaper)|New Delhi Times]]\n| date = 2018-11-14\n| accessdate = 2019-04-15\n| url-status= live\n}}\n</ref>\n}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikivoyage|Los Roques}}\n{{Commons category|Los Roques archipelago}}     \n<!-- ATTENTION!

The park consists of 40.61&nbsp;km\u00b2, 1500&nbsp;km\u00b2 of coral reefs, 42 coral cays surrounding a shallow central lagoon of 400&nbsp;km\u00b2, two barrier reefs (24&nbsp;km east and 32&nbsp;km south) and 300 sand banks, islands and cays, ranging in size from Cayo Grande (15.1&nbsp;km\u00b2) to the Gran Roque (1.7&nbsp;km\u00b2).<ref>Vila, Marco Aurelio. 1967: Aspectos geogr\u00e1ficos de las Dependencias Federales.

In 1941, the population was estimated at about 484 people. In 1950 it reached 559, and in 1987 663 permanent inhabitants. According to the Venezuelan census of 2001 1,209 inhabitants were counted. By 2008 it is estimated that the number inhabitants to be around 1,800.\n\nIts growth is limited because of restrictions involving the declaration as a national park in the 1970s. Most of the population is of Margarite\u00f1o origin who came to the islands mainly to engage in fishing. Since the early twentieth century there has been a small influx of foreigners (mostly Italian).\n\n===Climate===\n\nThe climate is warm and dry, with average annual temperature of {{convert|27.3|C|F|1}} in July and August, reaches a maximum of 34 \u00b0, and between September and January are presented occasional rain, with relative humidity 83% annually. Rainfall is {{convert|256.6|mm|2|abbr=on}} / year; minimum {{convert|6.6|mm|2|abbr=on}} (April) and maximum {{convert|52.2|mm|2|abbr=on}} (November).\n\n==Government==\nLos Roques is a Federal Dependency that is administered directly by officials appointed by the central or federal government of Venezuela.\n\nBetween 1990 and 2011 the central government appointed a director for the Single Area Authority (''Autoridad \u00danica de \u00c1rea'') within the Federal Dependencies, but that last year the central government created the figure of the Miranda Insular Territory (''Territorio Insular'') that encompasses not only Los Roques but [[La Orchila]] and [[Las Aves Archipelago]].\n\nThe headquarters of the head of government (''Jefe de Gobierno'') of the insular territory is the island of [[Gran Roque]] to the north of the Los Roques Archipelago.\n\nAdditionally in the island there are dependencies of other public organisms such as Inparques (''National Parks Institute'') since the archipelago is a national park and the National Guard of Venezuela (''Guardia Nacional'').\n\n==Tourism==\n===Infrastructure===\n[[El Gran Roque]] is the only populated island in the group. It has an airport suitable for small or [[STOL]] aircraft, [[Los Roques Airport]]. The airport is controlled from the [[Maiquet\u00eda]] airport on the mainland.\n\nFrom El Gran Roque most visitors that arrive, go to the port and travel to the keys in small boats called \"pe\u00f1eros\" from 9:00 am to 4:00 pm.<ref>http://www.eluniversal.com/guia-turistica/150531/los-roques</ref>\n\n===Attractions===\n[[File:Playa en Los Roques.jpg|thumb|Beach in Los Roques]]\nActivities include fishing ([[bonefish]], [[barracuda]], [[tarpon]], [[Carangidae|jack]], and [[Spanish mackerel]]), birding, [[snorkeling]], diving, paddling, [[windsurfing]], and [[kitesurfing]], and there is a sea turtle research center located on Dos Mosquises. Accommodations include Pez Raton Lodge, a property primarily used to host fishing guests, Posada Mediterraneo, a five-room inn which accommodates non-fishing guests, and dozens more like El Canto de la Ballena and Posada La Gaviota.\n[[File:Alcatraz (Pelecanus occidentalis) de los Roques Venezuela 001.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Brown pelican]]]]\n\n==See also==\n*[[Federal Dependencies of Venezuela]]\n*[[List of national parks of Venezuela]]\n*[[List of marine molluscs of Venezuela]]\n*[[List of Poriferans of Venezuela]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=newdelhitimes2018-11-14>\n{{cite news \n| url = https://www.newdelhitimes.com/us-donated-patrol-boats-to-panamas-servicio-nacional-aeronaval/\n| title = US donated Patrol boats to Panama\u2019s Servicio Nacional Aeronaval\n| work = [[New Delhi Times (newspaper)|New Delhi Times]]\n| date = 2018-11-14\n| accessdate = 2019-04-15\n| url-status= live\n}}\n</ref>\n}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikivoyage|Los Roques}}\n{{Commons category|Los Roques archipelago}}     \n<!-- ATTENTION!

He released other hit songs like \"Dance with Me Miss\" (1992) and \"GaNaDaRaMaBaSa\" (1992).<ref name=\"koreatimes\" /><ref name=\"koreajoongangdaily\" /><ref name=\"yonhap\" />\n\nHe was credited as the first pop musician to introduce Korean audiences to the [[new jack swing]] genre, which was popular in the mid-1980s and early 1990s in the U.S.\n\nActive in South Korea from 1991 to 1993, he suddenly disappeared from the public scene and returned to the U.S. In a 2019 interview with the [[The Korea Times]], he revealed that \"he was hated by many for his unusual looks and songs.\" Some also threw rocks during his performance at an open-air stage. While a 10-year visa he held in Korea as a U.S. national had to be recertified every six months, he was denied an extension to his visa for no reason by an official at the Immigration Office. His nationality as an American also made it hard for him to gain acceptance in South Korea.\n\nIn 2001, he made another debut as JIY, a member of a music band V2, with a third album \"Fantasy\". He hid his true identity as music producers told him he would not make it again due to his previous controversial image in Korea. His new song \"Fantasy\", composed by Valery Gaina of [[Cruise (band)|Cruise]], enjoyed a brief popularity before he finally put an end to his music career. Due to the agency's circumstances, it became impossible to work as a musician and after that he worked as an English teacher for 14 years. In 2015, he returned to the United States. Because of his age, he had a hard time finding work. He worked as a warehouse worker, office cleaner, and restaurant server.    \n\nIn 2019, he gained attention through [[JTBC]]'s ''[[Two Yoo Project Sugar Man]]'', a program dedicated to finding and rediscovering old singers from the past. He sang \"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGIndlf_xU4&t=64s Rebecca]\", [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QU462sGMclc \"GaNaDaRaMaBaSa\", \"Dance With Me Miss\"], and \"Fantasy\".

While a 10-year visa he held in Korea as a U.S. national had to be recertified every six months, he was denied an extension to his visa for no reason by an official at the Immigration Office. His nationality as an American also made it hard for him to gain acceptance in South Korea.\n\nIn 2001, he made another debut as JIY, a member of a music band V2, with a third album \"Fantasy\". He hid his true identity as music producers told him he would not make it again due to his previous controversial image in Korea. His new song \"Fantasy\", composed by Valery Gaina of [[Cruise (band)|Cruise]], enjoyed a brief popularity before he finally put an end to his music career. Due to the agency's circumstances, it became impossible to work as a musician and after that he worked as an English teacher for 14 years. In 2015, he returned to the United States. Because of his age, he had a hard time finding work. He worked as a warehouse worker, office cleaner, and restaurant server.    \n\nIn 2019, he gained attention through [[JTBC]]'s ''[[Two Yoo Project Sugar Man]]'', a program dedicated to finding and rediscovering old singers from the past.
