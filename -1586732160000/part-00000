The north choir aisle of Wirksworth church is dominated by a far more ostentatious monument, a large ornate alabaster chest tomb, a memorial to Ralph Gell of [[Hopton, Derbyshire|Hopton]], who died in 1563. The simple figure of the miner bears witness to the fact that for centuries the people of [[Wirksworth]] and their neighbours relied on lead mining. Ralph Gell's imposing tomb is evidence that a few people became rich and powerful from the trade.\n\nWhile Derbyshire lead made Gell and others rich, for poor families it was both a living and an adventure, with the possibility of a better life from a lucky find. The industry was organised in a way that gave a measure of independence to many of them.<ref name=\"Slack_a\">Slack 1988</ref> Mining was hard and dangerous work: death, illness and injury came from poisonous lead dust, underground floods, falling rock, [[methane]] gas in [[shale]] workings and lack of oxygen in badly ventilated galleries.<ref>Willies 1982, p.28</ref>  From the later years of the 17th century [[gunpowder]] introduced a further hazard.<ref>Rieuwerts 1998, p.83</ref> Nonetheless the thousands of shafts, hillocks and ruined buildings in the [[limestone]] landscape of the old lead mining areas, and the miles of galleries underground, make it plain that the veins of lead were intensively exploited. In the words of a petition to [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] \"many thousand people are dailie imployed in the lead mynes, to the greatt proffitt of your Majestie ... and to the whole Comonwealth ... in getting greatt quantities of lead for the use of the Kingdome in generall, and in transporting the rest to forraigne Nations...\".<ref>Derbyshire Record Office, D 258/10/9/35.</ref>\n[[File:lmhphot6.jpg|thumb|Smithycove Mine, Hopton]]\nBy the 17th century lead was second in importance in the national economy only to wool. It was essential for the roofs of public buildings and the new houses being built in every part of the country by the nobility and gentry. All houses, including farmhouses and cottages by then, had glazed windows, with lead glazing bars. It was the only material for water storage and piping. Every army used it as [[ammunition]]. There was a thriving export trade as well as the home market and the Wirksworth area was the main source of the [[ore]].\n\nWirksworth was the administrative centre of one of the ''hundreds'', local government units, of Derbyshire. Uniquely, the Wirksworth Hundred was still known by the archaic term ''[[Wapentake]]''. [[Lead ore]] was Crown property in most places and the mining area of Derbyshire under royal control was known as the King's Field, with two separately administered divisions, the High and Low Peaks, each further divided into ''liberties'', based on [[parish]]es. Wirksworth Wapentake was the Low Peak area of the King's Field. At different times there were liberties based on Wirksworth, [[Middleton-by-Wirksworth]], [[Cromford]], [[Brassington]], [[Matlock, Derbyshire|Matlock]], [[Elton, Derbyshire|Elton]], [[Middleton-by-Youlgreave]], [[Bonsall, Derbyshire|Bonsall]], Hopton and [[Carsington]], and from 1638 until 1654 there was a separate liberty for the Dovegang,<ref>Wirksworth Wapentake Survey, 1652: British Library, Add. MS. 6686, ff133-135 (copy in Matlock Local Studies Library).</ref> {{convert|200|acre|km2}} on Cromford Moor which had become extremely productive after being drained by the first of the Derbyshire drainage schemes, or ''[[sough]]s''.<ref>Rieuwerts 1987, p.104</ref>\n\nThere had always been lead mining in and around Wirksworth. This is limestone country and the fissures characteristic of limestone contained rich deposits of minerals, and especially of [[galena]]: lead ore. The Romans mined there and left inscribed \"pigs\", or ingots, of smelted lead as evidence.<ref>Barnatt 1999</ref> In the 9th century [[Repton Abbey]] owned mines at Wirksworth and when the [[abbey]] was destroyed by Danish troops in 874 they were taken by their Mercian puppet king [[Ceolwulf II of Mercia|Ceolwulf]].<ref>Ford & Rieuwerts 2000, p.18</ref> They remained in royal hands after the [[Norman conquest]] of England and paid royalties to the Crown for centuries afterwards. Lead mining and [[smelting]] was an established industry in 1086, when the mines at Wirksworth and [[Bakewell]] were recorded in the [[Domesday Book]].<ref>''Domesday Book: A Complete Translation''. London: Penguin, 2003. {{ISBN|0-14-143994-7}} p.741</ref>\n\n==Mining methods==\n[[File:Dirtlow Rake - geograph.org.uk - 2368667.jpg|right|thumb|Dirtlow Rake near Pindale]]\n\nLead had traditionally been found by following veins from surface outcroppings, particularly in \"rakes\" or vertical fissures.<ref>Willies 1982, p.7</ref>  By the 17th century, however, most surface lead had been mined and prospecting was achieved by less direct methods. Miners searched for surface signs that were similar to known lead-rich areas, they checked ploughed and other disturbed land for traces of ore, and they checked for signs in plants and trees and poorly performing crops, since lead is poisonous to most living things. They used probes to check for signs of ore in soil a few feet under the surface and dug exploratory holes or trenches in promising places. This was usually done to choose the best places to sink shafts ahead of existing working and the rules defined when and where these activities could be carried out.\n\nThe miners sank their shafts in ''turns'' of up to {{convert|90|ft|m|abbr=off}}, each turn being a few yards away from the bottom of the preceding one, along a gallery which may have been the working level reached by the earlier shaft. They climbed up and down their shafts using either footholes in the shaft walls or ''stemples'', wooden steps built into the sides, an exhausting and dangerous way to start and finish a day's work. These ''climbing shafts'' were usually within the miners' ''coe'', the limestone-walled cabin in which they stored tools, a change of clothes and food. Where the mine was on a hillside the vein could often be reached via an ''[[adit]]'' or tunnel driven into the slope.\n\nOre was brought to the surface up a ''winding shaft'' outside the coe. The miners' equipment included picks, hammers and wedges to split the rock, ''wiskets'' or baskets to contain it, ''corves'' or sledges to drag it to the shaft bottom, and windlasses or ''stows'', to lift it to the surface. In later years underground transport was improved by replacing corves by wagons, often running on wooden or metal rails. A good example of an 18th-century wooden railway can be found in the Merry Tom mine, near [[Via Gellia]].<ref>Personal communication by John Jones to Ron Slack 2000</ref> The miners avoided the need to excavate hard rock whenever they could and where it was unavoidable sometimes resorted to [[fire-setting]].<ref>Willies 1994</ref> A fire was built against the rock face after mining had finished for the day and allowed to burn through the night. Fragmentation of the heated rock was increased by throwing water on to it. The rule about fire-setting only after the end of the day's work was important because in the confined mines the smoke was deadly. Fire-setting was a skilled technique and was used sparingly for that reason as well as because of the disruption caused by the smoke and the danger from splintering rock.\n\n==16th-century technical change==\n\nAfter a mid-16th-century slump the industry recovered, new mines were opened on Middleton Moor, and production increased, a recovery mainly due to technical developments. While traditional extraction methods had persisted there were vital changes in the ways in which ore was prepared for smelting and in the smelting process itself.<ref>Kiernan 1989, p.164</ref>\n\n===Bole smelting===\n\nThe traditional [[smelter]] was a ''bole'', a large fire built on a hill and relying on wind power. It functioned best with large pieces of rich ore known as ''bing'' and could not deal with anything small enough to pass through a half-inch mesh riddle. The bole smelter therefore resulted in large amounts of ore accumulating on waste heaps. It required two days of strong wind and could only function when the conditions were favourable.<ref>D. Kiernan & R. Van de Noort 1992</ref>\n\n===Smelting mills===\n\nIn the late 16th century wind power was abandoned and the smelting blast was provided by a [[bellows]] driven first by foot, to an ore hearth, and later by water-power in a smelting mill. The mills were fuelled by \u201cwhite coal\u201d, which was in fact kiln-dried branch wood. Wood was preferred to [[charcoal]] for the main furnace, which smelted ore from the mines, as charcoal generated more heat than this furnace required. Drying the wood eliminated smoke, which would have made it difficult for the smelters to keep the necessary close observation of the process. Charcoal was used in a second furnace, which resmelted the slag from the first, and required greater heat. Draught for the furnaces came from two large bellows driven by the water wheels. Lead ore of all grades was first broken or ground again into finer particles and rewashed to produce very pure ore for the furnace. These smelters could deal with much finer particles of ore and new techniques were introduced to provide them.<ref>Crossley 1992</ref>\n\n===Dressing===\n\nBefore a miner could sell his ore he had to dress it. Dressing was the process of extracting the ore from the rock in which it was embedded and washing it, a further refining process. In the days of bole smelting the ore was roughly washed clean of waste minerals and dirt before being riddled for bing ore. The ore for the new smelters was smashed, or crushed, into pieces about the size of peas. This was done by hand, using a hammer called a ''bucker'' or, in larger mines, on a ''crushing circle'', where a horse dragged a roller round a paved circle on which the ore was placed. Crushed ore was washed either by running water over it in a sloping trough called a ''buddle'' or by placing it in a sieve fine enough to prevent any ore particles passing through. The sieve was then plunged several times into a trough. In each case the object was to allow the heavier, lead-rich, particles to sink, enabling those containing lighter, unwanted minerals to be skimmed off the top and removed. These processes were then repeated at the smelter. By the 17th century new mines were being opened, shafts driven deeper, and old waste heaps were yielding new supplies for the smelters.<ref>Kiernan 1989, p.200</ref>\n[[File:minphot1.jpg|thumb|Remains of stone washing buddle at Perseverance Mine on Carsington Pasture]]\n\n==Mining customs==\n\nEverything about the old lead industry, from the mining of ore to its sale, stemmed from the ancient claim of the monarch to all mineral rights. The whole structure was designed to enable the [[Duchy of Lancaster]], a royal possession, to collect the king's royalties and, since these were farmed out, the miners paid them to the king's farmer. By the 17th century the local holder of the mineral rights was also the barmaster, who ran the industry, helped by deputies responsible for the liberties, and by the miners' juries of the Barmote Court. The lead industry is long gone, but its traditions are still maintained and the barmaster and the jury still meet in the Barmote Hall in Wirksworth.<ref name=\"Slack_a\">Slack 1988</ref>\n[[File:lmhphot4.jpg|thumb|Barmote Hall, Wirksworth]]\nIt was the royal possession of the mineral rights and the royal wish to encourage lead mining, that dictated the two characteristic features of so-called \"free mining\". Any man who could demonstrate to the barmaster that he had discovered a significant amount of ore was allowed to open a mine and retain the title to it as long as he continued to work it, and, secondly, mining took precedence over land ownership. No land owner or farmer could interfere with lead mining, though there were many attempts to limit its damage. In 1620 the Duchy of Lancaster's tenants at [[Brassington]] complained that lead mining was poisoning their cattle.<ref>The National Archives, DL43/1/19, PFF 1322.</ref>  In 1663 the Brassington manor court forbade miners from taking water from the village well to wash ore, on pain of a fine of 1 shilling, and in 1670 imposed fines of 3/4d on miners who left shafts uncovered or raised heaps of soil and waste minerals against fences, allowing cattle to climb over them.<ref>Derbyshire Record Office, 166M/M1.</ref> But the customs raised the possibility of ordinary families making a living independently of farmers or other employers and in the regular conflict between miners and landowners in the Wirksworth area the miners usually managed to hang on to them, though they did lose some of their fights.\n\n===King's farmers and chief barmasters===\n\nThe coveted and valuable farm of the Duchy of Lancaster's right to the lead mine duties, coupled as it was with the office of chief barmaster, endowed its owner with both a considerable income and authority over the running of the industry. It was always resold at a much higher price than that charged by the Duchy, which was  \u00a3110 plus annual payments of \u00a372 for the duties and \u00a31-6-8d for the barmastership.<ref name=\"Slack_a\"/>\n\n===Chief barmasters and the 24===\n\nAt dinner in Wirksworth after meetings of the 17th-century Barmote Court, the landlord of the inn had three tables for those attending the Court.<ref>Derbyshire Record Office, D 258/28/2a.</ref> There was the \"24 table\", where the members of the 24-man jury sat, and where he charged 8d per head, \"the barmasters' table\", at 10d a head, and a table where \"gentlemen's dinners\" cost 1 shilling each. The gentlemen drank sack or [[claret]] with their dinner; the men were served with beer. The bill was paid by the king's farmer and chief barmaster. There were usually about a dozen gentlemen, some of whom were members of the jury, while others were there to present a case to the Court. Also among the gentlemen were the steward of the court, who was a lawyer and who conducted the sessions. When the chief barmaster for the Wapentake, always a man of wealth and rank, was a local gentleman such as Sir John Gell of Hopton<ref name=\"Slack_a\" /> or his son John, the 2nd baronet, he often attended the Court himself. If the current chief barmaster was an absentee member of the gentry or nobility he relied on his deputy barmasters.\n\nIn addition to helping the barmasters to carry out their duties the 24 jurors brought practical experience to bear when the Barmote Court was adjudicating in disputes and trials. The main requirement of the jurymen was that they should be knowledgeable in mining matters and they included both working miners and, when it was thought necessary, local gentry.\n\n===Deputy barmasters===\n\nThe deputy barmasters whom the chief barmaster appointed were experienced local men. Some of them were yeoman farmer/miners and others local gentlemen.<ref>Slack 1991</ref>  The deputy barmasters actually ran the system. It was they who initiated much of the business of the Court. It was they, in administering the rules, who determined whether a miner should have a particular mine or whether another should lose one. Their duties required them to be able to read, write and keep account of granting and removing title to mines and of ore production and the duties levied on it. As ore was brought from a mine, it was measured by the dish and the barmaster collected each 13th dish, a royalty or duty known as ''lot''. This was the barmaster's ''reckoning''. A further duty of sixpence a load (9 dishes) was paid by the merchants who bought the ore from the miners. This second duty was called ''cope''.\n\n===Giving a mine===\n\nThe barmaster or his deputy granted title in a mine, the usual name for which was ''grove'' or ''groove'', on receipt of proof that it was viable. The proof was a standard container, a dish, filled with about {{convert|65|lb|kg|abbr=off}} of ore from the mine in question. Every dish was calibrated by the barmaster twice a year against a brass standard dish. The miner thus granted title to the mine was said to have ''freed'' it, either ''for old'' if a development in an existing mine, or ''for new'' in the case of a new discovery. He was given permission to work 2 ''meers'' of ground, known as ''founder meers'', with no restriction on width or depth. A third meer was the king's, and other miners were each allowed to open a further meer, ''taker meers'', along the vein. The miner marked each meer with his ''possessions'' or ''stows'' (a miniature version of the stows or windlass used to ''wind'' the ore from the shaft). A meer was {{convert|29|yd|m}}, in the Wirksworth Wapentake.\n\nSince the course of a vein of lead was unpredictable, there were many disputes caused by one group of miners following a vein into another mine. There were occasions when possession was disputed by physical means.\n\n===Title-holding and record keeping===\n\nThe deputy barmasters were responsible for settling disputes over ownership or of ''arresting'' or suspending operation of mines pending decisions of the Barmote Court. They could withdraw title whenever a mine was left unworked. They checked the mines regularly and used their knives to ''nick'' the stows at any neglected mine. After three nicks at weekly intervals title could be transferred to another miner. The mining rules required working shareholders in a mine to pull their weight. Any who did not were dispossessed, after a warning at the Barmote Court. Typical was this injunction from the court on 2 April 1630: \"Wee saie that Thomas Taylor Henry Lowe and John Wooley shall come within tenn daies of warning given them by the Barrmaster and shall keepe Thomas Redforde companie at their groves in Home Rake or else to loose theire parte.\"<ref>National Archive DL 30/54/669A</ref>\n\nThe deputy barmasters kept records of all changes of title and of the amounts of ore measured and the amounts of lot ore and cope collected at their regular ''reckonings'' at the mines. The lot and cope ''accounts'' involved quite complicated arithmetic. The information given included the period covered, the name of the miner or mine (occasionally both were given), the amount of ore mined, the number of dishes of lot ore received, the amount of ore sold to each buyer and the sum of money chargeable to each buyer for cope.<ref>Derbyshire Record Office D258/58/24</ref> Traditional methods were used at the reckonings; barmasters carried knives \"to worke uppon a sticke the nomber of dishes of oare as they were measured which is usuall to be done at a reckoning\".<ref name=\"DerbyshireRecord\">Derbyshire Record Office D258/30/16-24</ref> Many of their records have survived.\n\n===Accidents===\n\nIn conjunction with the jury of 24 sitting at the Barmote Courts, the deputy barmasters adjudicated in disputes and enforced compliance with the customs of the mines. Their duties extended to acting as the coroner in the case of fatal accidents, where a specially summoned jury of twelve or thirteen local miners decided the cause of death. In an 18th-century example the Brassington barmaster, Edward Ashton, followed the rules after a death in Throstle Nest mine.\n\n<blockquote>Wirksworth Wapentake March 26th 1761.\nWe, whose names are under written, being this day summoned by Mr. Edward Ashton, Bar-Master for the Liberty of Brassington, to a groove called by the name of Throstle Nest on Brassington Pasture; to enquire into the cause of the death of T.W. now lying before us; accordingly we have been down the shaft to the Foot thereof, and down one sump or turn to the foot thereof, and on a gate North-wardly about sixteen yards to the Forefield, where the deceased had been at work; and by the information of William Briddon who was working near him; it appears that a large stone fell upon him out of the roof, and it is our opinions the said stone was the cause of his death.<ref>Hardy 1762</ref></blockquote>\n[[File:minphot2.jpg|thumb|Datestone of TW, the miner killed in Throstlenest Mine in 1761, carved on limestone outcrop a few feet from the mineshaft]]\n\n===Structure of industry===\n\nThe free mining arrangement under the rules of the Duchy of Lancaster was the normal state of affairs in the Duchy manor of Wirksworth. The Duchy's lessee of the mineral rights at the end of the 16th century, Gilbert, Earl of Shrewsbury, had established his right to the dues of lot and cope against attempts by local landowners to assert right to mines on their land.<ref>Wood 1999, p.207</ref> Shrewsbury's success embedded the old rules and facilitated free mining.\n\nThere was one independent area within the Wapentake, Griffe Grange, near Brassington, held by the Gell family of Hopton since Ralph Gell had leased it from Dale Abbey and bought it from the Crown Commissioners at the dissolution of the religious houses by Henry VIII.<ref>Derbyshire Record Office D258/53/3a,b,c</ref> The Gells, however, ran their mines under similar rules to those in the Duchy, the only difference being that the miners paid their dues to them.<ref>Derbyshire Record Office D258/20/7/1-40</ref> Attempts by other landowners to establish the same rights as the Gells were largely unsuccessful. An example occurred at [[Elton, Derbyshire|Elton]], where the landowner, Francis Foljambe, prevented the application of Duchy rules, employing wage labourers in the Elton mines and seeking sanction for his action in the courts. The Duchy Court, however, issued an injunction against him in 1627, instructing him \"to conveane or execute noe other suite or suites hereafter att the Comon Lawe ... concerning the lott and copp and lead mynes in Elton\".<ref name=\"DerbyshireRecord\" /> This ruling was applied in all the Duchy liberties, though there was a renewal of opposition from landowners after the Restoration of 1660.\n\nFor historical reasons the structure of the industry was different in the High Peak where, mainly because of very long leases, there had been a blurring of the Duchy's authority, and the two largest landowners, the Manners and Cavendish families, maintained claims to mining rights and dues.<ref>Wood 1999, pp.238\u2013248</ref> The miners fought hard, physically and in the courts, to obtain the free mining rights enjoyed in the Wirksworth Wapentake. The Manners family met them head-on, refused all attempts to establish free mining, and employed miners as day labourers in their mines. Their Cavendish neighbours at Chatsworth, after a period of conflict, adopted the same pattern as the Gells at Griffe Grange, collecting the dues from mines run by Duchy of Lancaster rules.\n\nThe operation of the old rules and customs in the Wirksworth Wapentake did not prevent the development of a complicated structure there. The barmasters' ore accounts, identifying mines and/or proprietors, reveal a mixture of free mining, ownership of large mines by rich entrepreneurs and the rewashing of old spoil heaps. Where there was a rich source of ore and especially where access required dewatering, the mines were owned by venture capitalists employing miners either as contracted groups, who considered themselves as free miners negotiating a price for their work or, more rarely, as wage labourers. The barmasters' accounts for 1653<ref>Derbyshire Record Office D258/28/20c</ref> show that the ore from the Brassington, Middleton and Wirksworth liberties, all low producers at the time, consisted of small amounts mined by a large number of names. Clearly, in these liberties, at this time, it was the small-time miners, most of whom would have had other sources of income, usually farming, who were paying their dues and selling to the lead merchants and smelters. In a fourth liberty, Cromford, the picture was different. With the Dovegang dewatered by Vermuyden's Sough (see below), the output there dwarfed the combined output of the other three liberties, and 51% of it came from mines owned by the rich lead merchant Lionel Tynley. 88% came from four sources, while the rest was mined by 45 independent miners. Finally, 6,108 loads (about 1,527 tons), or 23% of the total ore sold in the four liberties, was won from old hillocks by so-called \"cavers\".\n\n==Pollution==\n\nLead is poisonous to both plants and animals. For people the smelting processes are the most dangerous \u2013 the restored smelter at Spitewinter, near Chesterfield, stands a few yards from Belland Lane, ''belland'' being lead poisoning. The current owners of the smelter on the site of the former Mill Close mine at Darley Bridge have bought much of the adjoining land and turned arable and pasture into woodland, to avoid the danger to crops and animals.\n\nThe danger to plants and animals, particularly from washing or \"buddling\", has been known for centuries and the nuisance to the people of Brassington described above was typical of the conflict between farmers and miners. In the 1680s Sir John Gell II gave his opinion during such a dispute. \"For buddling ... I have heard that miners have been indicted for it, and the freeholders and occupiers of land are much prejudiced by it. It sets the cattle upon the belland, which is destructive to the cattle and horses and often kills them.\"<ref>British Library, Add. MS. 6681, ff140-141 (microfilm copy in Matlock Local Studies Library).</ref>\n\nIn 1794 several groups of Wensley miners who had buddled mine waste in the river Derwent above and below Darley Bridge were brought to court, accused of polluting the river.<ref>British Library, Add. MS. 6676, ff132-160 (microfilm copy in Matlock Local Studies Library).</ref> Witnesses described the river as being muddied as far down-river as a mile below Cromford Bridge, and a Matlock publican claimed to have been prevented from his usual practice of using river water for his brewing by the state of the Derwent. He had had to sink a well to stay in business. Mining law was cited by both sides. The miners quoted the custom which allowed them to wash their ore, while plaintiffs replied with the law which stipulated that sludge from washing should be emptied into \"some convenient place within their quarter cord (which is a space of seven yards and a quarter, or the fourth part of a meer, on each side of their vein)\" to prevent pollution of the adjacent land. The miners, who had carted their ore to the river, as being easier than carting water to their mine \u2013 their mine was dry and there is a steep hill from Wensley to the Derwent \u2013 lost their case.\n[[File:minphot3.jpg|thumb|Settling pond for washing sludge at Corsehill Mine, Brassington]]\nIn addition to the mining law to prevent water pollution quoted in the Wensley case, often ignored by the miners, attempts to prevent pollution of farmland included tree planting to deter cattle from grazing near mining operations \u2013 there are many examples of trees planted on the lines of veins in the old mining areas as well as the recent afforestation at Darley Bridge. Smelting mills were provided with chimneys to dissipate the fumes from the ore hearths. These were only partly successful as the mills were often sited in or near to settlements, which suffered from lead deposits from the chimneys. The mills also polluted the streams which powered their bellows.<ref>Kiernan 1989, p.157</ref>  Cupolas, described below, conveyed their emissions via tunnels to chimneys, which were often a considerable distance from the smelter. The limited success achieved by these efforts is exemplified by the naming of Belland Lane.\n\n==Mine drainage==\n\nUntil the 17th century mining had usually been abandoned when the work reached the water table. Efforts at draining lead mines by horse-powered pumps, or \u201cengines\u201d, had little success. In the later years of the industry mines were successfully drained by hydraulic, steam, internal combustion and electric power, but the first successes were achieved by soughs, drainage tunnels driven into flooded veins to allow the water to run off.<ref>Rieuwerts 1987</ref> Dr Rieuwerts has provided a comprehensive gazetteer of the Derbyshire lead mining soughs. By lowering the water table and opening up large new deposits of lead ore, they transformed the industry.\n\nThe first [[sough]], designed by Sir [[Cornelius Vermuyden]], knighted for his work in draining the East Anglian fens, was driven over a twenty-year period from a point on Cromford Hill, between [[Cromford]] and [[Wirksworth]], into an area called the Dovegang. When it was completed in 1652 there was an immediate jump in ore production in the area. Vermuyden's was followed by a succession of soughs which by the end of the century had drained enough of the mines in the Wirksworth Wapentake to cause a dramatic rise in production in the whole area. The most important were the Cromford Sough, which was over thirty years in driving, between 1662 and 1696, and was continued in the 18th century, and Hannage Sough, begun in 1693 and also continued into the next century. The Cromford Sough provided the power for [[Richard Arkwright]]'s mills at Cromford, the first of which was built in 1771. Also among the important 17th century soughs were the Raventor, begun in 1655, Bates (1657\u201384), Lees (1664), and Baileycroft (1667\u201373). The Baileycroft Sough drained mines in Wirksworth. Those in the area just to the north of Wirksworth called the Gulf were drained by the Raventor and Lees Soughs. The Bates and Cromford Soughs drained mines on Cromford Moor \u2014 Bates Sough had reached the Dovegang by 1684. Hannage Sough drained the area to the east of Yokecliffe Rake, on the south of Wirksworth.\n\nDrainage of the mines in the whole of the Wirksworth area was eventually accomplished by the Meerbrook Sough, begun at the level of the river Derwent in 1772, at a time when lead-mining ventures had become only intermittently profitable. The entrance to this sough is {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=off}} wide and {{convert|8|ft|m|abbr=off}} high and has a keystone inscribed \u201cFH 1772\u201d. FH was Francis Hurt of Alderwasley, smelter, lead mine shareholder, iron-master and the main shareholder in the sough.

Their characteristic overheating and dissemination of polluting fumes made it necessary to close the smelter down at the end of each day's work. The hearth burned out quickly and regular weekly repairs or rebuilding were necessary \u2013 between 24 June and 29 September 1657, for instance, thirteen new hearths were required at the Upper Mill in [[Wirksworth]].<ref>Derbyshire Record Office, D 258/61/49b.</ref> Water-powered smelting mills were restricted to riverside sites and \u201cwhite coal\u201d fuel required a good supply of timber. By the 18th century timber supplies were running out and, where [[coke (fuel)|coke]] or coal was used because of timber shortages, impurities, particularly sulphur, were introduced into the lead. It was, finally, less efficient than the cupola.\n\nThe cupola was a [[reverberatory furnace]]. The fuel was burned in a combustion chamber at the side of the furnace, separate from the \u201ccharge\u201d of ore, thus avoiding any contamination. This removed the disadvantage in using coal, which was far more plentiful than timber. The ore was loaded from a hopper into a concave furnace with a low, arched roof and a tall chimney or a flue at the opposite end from the combustion chamber. The flames and heated gases from the fuel were drawn across the charge by the draught from the chimney and beaten down by reverberation from the low roof. Slag on the surface of the molten lead was raked off and the lead itself poured into an iron pot at the side, before being ladled into moulds.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the cupola's greater efficiency than the smelting mill. Unlike the smelting mill, the cupola could be operated continuously. Since the air flow over the ore was less powerful than that from the bellows of the blast furnace fewer lead particles were blown away. Further lead was saved by the fact that since the fuel and the charge were separate none of the lead was lost into the ash. Since no water power was needed the cupola had a fourth theoretical advantage of being freed from the riverside location of the blast furnace, and able to be placed in the most convenient site for supply of ore and coal. However, the higher temperatures needed to melt the slag recovered from the primary melt required a water-powered furnace and, since slag mills tended to be placed next to the cupolas, most cupolas remained in riverside sites.\n\nMany cupolas had long horizontal flues, which were introduced to trap pollutants before they could be discharged into the air. Since the pollutants included metal vapour, the sweepings of the flue could also be recovered for resmelting.\n\n==Closure==\n\nThe Derbyshire lead industry declined after the late 18th century because of worked-out veins, increased production costs and the discovery of much cheaper foreign sources. The industry was protected from this foreign ore by import duty in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. A reduction in the duty in 1820 and its abolition in 1845<ref>6 Geo IV c104 & 8 & 9 Vic. c.90 respectively (quoted in Burt,1984, p.235)</ref> brought a steep rise in the volume of lead imported into England and accelerated the local industry's decline.\n\nThere were still bursts of high production, and indeed the output of certain mines during the 18th and 19th centuries exceeded anything achieved in the 17th century; over 2658 loads (about 641 [[long ton|ton]]s or 651 [[tonne|metric tonnes]]) were mined at Brassington, traditionally an area of low output, in 1862.<ref>Chatsworth House. Barmaster's Collection. Transcript Roger Flindall</ref>  At a meeting of the Barmote Court in Wirksworth in 1862 one mine owner announced \"that by perseverance for upwards of twenty years, they had at last found the long sought for treasure, which he hoped would be prosperous, and they should be able to continue employing, as they are at the present time, upwards of 100 men at one mine in Brassington\".<ref>''Derby & Chesterfield Reporter'', 2 May 1862, p.8, col.6</ref>  However, by 1901 the number of men employed in all the Derbyshire lead mines had fallen to 285<ref>Ford, TD and Rieuwerts, JH, 2000, p.60</ref> most of whom worked at the [[Mill Close Mine]] at Darley Bridge. Mill Close, the biggest lead mine in the country, took the Derbyshire lead industry into the 20th century, and just before its enforced closure in 1939, caused by flooding, employed about 600 men.<ref>Willies 1989</ref> The smelter at Mill Close, established in 1934, was bought in 1941 by H J Enthoven and Sons, a London-based lead producer, and still operates.\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Derbyshire}}\n*[[Beans and Bacon mine]]\n*[[Magpie Mine]]\n*[[Odin Mine]]\n*[[Lathkill Dale#Lead mining|Lathkill Dale (lead mining)]]\n*[[Peak District Mining Museum]]\n* [[Killhope Wheel]], Lead Mining Museum, Co.

He is a lead miner. The north choir aisle of Wirksworth church is dominated by a far more ostentatious monument, a large ornate alabaster chest tomb, a memorial to Ralph Gell of [[Hopton, Derbyshire|Hopton]], who died in 1563. The simple figure of the miner bears witness to the fact that for centuries the people of [[Wirksworth]] and their neighbours relied on lead mining. Ralph Gell's imposing tomb is evidence that a few people became rich and powerful from the trade.\n\nWhile Derbyshire lead made Gell and others rich, for poor families it was both a living and an adventure, with the possibility of a better life from a lucky find. The industry was organised in a way that gave a measure of independence to many of them.<ref name=\"Slack_a\">Slack 1988</ref> Mining was hard and dangerous work: death, illness and injury came from poisonous lead dust, underground floods, falling rock, [[methane]] gas in [[shale]] workings and lack of oxygen in badly ventilated galleries.<ref>Willies 1982, p.28</ref>  From the later years of the 17th century [[gunpowder]] introduced a further hazard.<ref>Rieuwerts 1998, p.83</ref> Nonetheless the thousands of shafts, hillocks and ruined buildings in the [[limestone]] landscape of the old lead mining areas, and the miles of galleries underground, make it plain that the veins of lead were intensively exploited. In the words of a petition to [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] \"many thousand people are dailie imployed in the lead mynes, to the greatt proffitt of your Majestie ... and to the whole Comonwealth ... in getting greatt quantities of lead for the use of the Kingdome in generall, and in transporting the rest to forraigne Nations...\".<ref>Derbyshire Record Office, D 258/10/9/35.</ref>\n[[File:lmhphot6.jpg|thumb|Smithycove Mine, Hopton]]\nBy the 17th century lead was second in importance in the national economy only to wool. It was essential for the roofs of public buildings and the new houses being built in every part of the country by the nobility and gentry. All houses, including farmhouses and cottages by then, had glazed windows, with lead glazing bars. It was the only material for water storage and piping. Every army used it as [[ammunition]]. There was a thriving export trade as well as the home market and the Wirksworth area was the main source of the [[ore]].\n\nWirksworth was the administrative centre of one of the ''hundreds'', local government units, of Derbyshire. Uniquely, the Wirksworth Hundred was still known by the archaic term ''[[Wapentake]]''. [[Lead ore]] was Crown property in most places and the mining area of Derbyshire under royal control was known as the King's Field, with two separately administered divisions, the High and Low Peaks, each further divided into ''liberties'', based on [[parish]]es. Wirksworth Wapentake was the Low Peak area of the King's Field. At different times there were liberties based on Wirksworth, [[Middleton-by-Wirksworth]], [[Cromford]], [[Brassington]], [[Matlock, Derbyshire|Matlock]], [[Elton, Derbyshire|Elton]], [[Middleton-by-Youlgreave]], [[Bonsall, Derbyshire|Bonsall]], Hopton and [[Carsington]], and from 1638 until 1654 there was a separate liberty for the Dovegang,<ref>Wirksworth Wapentake Survey, 1652: British Library, Add. MS. 6686, ff133-135 (copy in Matlock Local Studies Library).</ref> {{convert|200|acre|km2}} on Cromford Moor which had become extremely productive after being drained by the first of the Derbyshire drainage schemes, or ''[[sough]]s''.<ref>Rieuwerts 1987, p.104</ref>\n\nThere had always been lead mining in and around Wirksworth. This is limestone country and the fissures characteristic of limestone contained rich deposits of minerals, and especially of [[galena]]: lead ore. The Romans mined there and left inscribed \"pigs\", or ingots, of smelted lead as evidence.<ref>Barnatt 1999</ref> In the 9th century [[Repton Abbey]] owned mines at Wirksworth and when the [[abbey]] was destroyed by Danish troops in 874 they were taken by their Mercian puppet king [[Ceolwulf II of Mercia|Ceolwulf]].<ref>Ford & Rieuwerts 2000, p.18</ref> They remained in royal hands after the [[Norman conquest]] of England and paid royalties to the Crown for centuries afterwards. Lead mining and [[smelting]] was an established industry in 1086, when the mines at Wirksworth and [[Bakewell]] were recorded in the [[Domesday Book]].<ref>''Domesday Book: A Complete Translation''. London: Penguin, 2003. {{ISBN|0-14-143994-7}} p.741</ref>\n\n==Mining methods==\n[[File:Dirtlow Rake - geograph.org.uk - 2368667.jpg|right|thumb|Dirtlow Rake near Pindale]]\n\nLead had traditionally been found by following veins from surface outcroppings, particularly in \"rakes\" or vertical fissures.<ref>Willies 1982, p.7</ref>  By the 17th century, however, most surface lead had been mined and prospecting was achieved by less direct methods. Miners searched for surface signs that were similar to known lead-rich areas, they checked ploughed and other disturbed land for traces of ore, and they checked for signs in plants and trees and poorly performing crops, since lead is poisonous to most living things. They used probes to check for signs of ore in soil a few feet under the surface and dug exploratory holes or trenches in promising places. This was usually done to choose the best places to sink shafts ahead of existing working and the rules defined when and where these activities could be carried out.\n\nThe miners sank their shafts in ''turns'' of up to {{convert|90|ft|m|abbr=off}}, each turn being a few yards away from the bottom of the preceding one, along a gallery which may have been the working level reached by the earlier shaft. They climbed up and down their shafts using either footholes in the shaft walls or ''stemples'', wooden steps built into the sides, an exhausting and dangerous way to start and finish a day's work. These ''climbing shafts'' were usually within the miners' ''coe'', the limestone-walled cabin in which they stored tools, a change of clothes and food. Where the mine was on a hillside the vein could often be reached via an ''[[adit]]'' or tunnel driven into the slope.\n\nOre was brought to the surface up a ''winding shaft'' outside the coe. The miners' equipment included picks, hammers and wedges to split the rock, ''wiskets'' or baskets to contain it, ''corves'' or sledges to drag it to the shaft bottom, and windlasses or ''stows'', to lift it to the surface. In later years underground transport was improved by replacing corves by wagons, often running on wooden or metal rails. A good example of an 18th-century wooden railway can be found in the Merry Tom mine, near [[Via Gellia]].<ref>Personal communication by John Jones to Ron Slack 2000</ref> The miners avoided the need to excavate hard rock whenever they could and where it was unavoidable sometimes resorted to [[fire-setting]].<ref>Willies 1994</ref> A fire was built against the rock face after mining had finished for the day and allowed to burn through the night. Fragmentation of the heated rock was increased by throwing water on to it. The rule about fire-setting only after the end of the day's work was important because in the confined mines the smoke was deadly. Fire-setting was a skilled technique and was used sparingly for that reason as well as because of the disruption caused by the smoke and the danger from splintering rock.\n\n==16th-century technical change==\n\nAfter a mid-16th-century slump the industry recovered, new mines were opened on Middleton Moor, and production increased, a recovery mainly due to technical developments. While traditional extraction methods had persisted there were vital changes in the ways in which ore was prepared for smelting and in the smelting process itself.<ref>Kiernan 1989, p.164</ref>\n\n===Bole smelting===\n\nThe traditional [[smelter]] was a ''bole'', a large fire built on a hill and relying on wind power. It functioned best with large pieces of rich ore known as ''bing'' and could not deal with anything small enough to pass through a half-inch mesh riddle. The bole smelter therefore resulted in large amounts of ore accumulating on waste heaps. It required two days of strong wind and could only function when the conditions were favourable.<ref>D. Kiernan & R. Van de Noort 1992</ref>\n\n===Smelting mills===\n\nIn the late 16th century wind power was abandoned and the smelting blast was provided by a [[bellows]] driven first by foot, to an ore hearth, and later by water-power in a smelting mill. The mills were fuelled by \u201cwhite coal\u201d, which was in fact kiln-dried branch wood. Wood was preferred to [[charcoal]] for the main furnace, which smelted ore from the mines, as charcoal generated more heat than this furnace required. Drying the wood eliminated smoke, which would have made it difficult for the smelters to keep the necessary close observation of the process. Charcoal was used in a second furnace, which resmelted the slag from the first, and required greater heat. Draught for the furnaces came from two large bellows driven by the water wheels. Lead ore of all grades was first broken or ground again into finer particles and rewashed to produce very pure ore for the furnace. These smelters could deal with much finer particles of ore and new techniques were introduced to provide them.<ref>Crossley 1992</ref>\n\n===Dressing===\n\nBefore a miner could sell his ore he had to dress it. Dressing was the process of extracting the ore from the rock in which it was embedded and washing it, a further refining process. In the days of bole smelting the ore was roughly washed clean of waste minerals and dirt before being riddled for bing ore. The ore for the new smelters was smashed, or crushed, into pieces about the size of peas. This was done by hand, using a hammer called a ''bucker'' or, in larger mines, on a ''crushing circle'', where a horse dragged a roller round a paved circle on which the ore was placed. Crushed ore was washed either by running water over it in a sloping trough called a ''buddle'' or by placing it in a sieve fine enough to prevent any ore particles passing through. The sieve was then plunged several times into a trough. In each case the object was to allow the heavier, lead-rich, particles to sink, enabling those containing lighter, unwanted minerals to be skimmed off the top and removed. These processes were then repeated at the smelter. By the 17th century new mines were being opened, shafts driven deeper, and old waste heaps were yielding new supplies for the smelters.<ref>Kiernan 1989, p.200</ref>\n[[File:minphot1.jpg|thumb|Remains of stone washing buddle at Perseverance Mine on Carsington Pasture]]\n\n==Mining customs==\n\nEverything about the old lead industry, from the mining of ore to its sale, stemmed from the ancient claim of the monarch to all mineral rights. The whole structure was designed to enable the [[Duchy of Lancaster]], a royal possession, to collect the king's royalties and, since these were farmed out, the miners paid them to the king's farmer. By the 17th century the local holder of the mineral rights was also the barmaster, who ran the industry, helped by deputies responsible for the liberties, and by the miners' juries of the Barmote Court. The lead industry is long gone, but its traditions are still maintained and the barmaster and the jury still meet in the Barmote Hall in Wirksworth.<ref name=\"Slack_a\">Slack 1988</ref>\n[[File:lmhphot4.jpg|thumb|Barmote Hall, Wirksworth]]\nIt was the royal possession of the mineral rights and the royal wish to encourage lead mining, that dictated the two characteristic features of so-called \"free mining\". Any man who could demonstrate to the barmaster that he had discovered a significant amount of ore was allowed to open a mine and retain the title to it as long as he continued to work it, and, secondly, mining took precedence over land ownership. No land owner or farmer could interfere with lead mining, though there were many attempts to limit its damage. In 1620 the Duchy of Lancaster's tenants at [[Brassington]] complained that lead mining was poisoning their cattle.<ref>The National Archives, DL43/1/19, PFF 1322.</ref>  In 1663 the Brassington manor court forbade miners from taking water from the village well to wash ore, on pain of a fine of 1 shilling, and in 1670 imposed fines of 3/4d on miners who left shafts uncovered or raised heaps of soil and waste minerals against fences, allowing cattle to climb over them.<ref>Derbyshire Record Office, 166M/M1.</ref> But the customs raised the possibility of ordinary families making a living independently of farmers or other employers and in the regular conflict between miners and landowners in the Wirksworth area the miners usually managed to hang on to them, though they did lose some of their fights.\n\n===King's farmers and chief barmasters===\n\nThe coveted and valuable farm of the Duchy of Lancaster's right to the lead mine duties, coupled as it was with the office of chief barmaster, endowed its owner with both a considerable income and authority over the running of the industry. It was always resold at a much higher price than that charged by the Duchy, which was  \u00a3110 plus annual payments of \u00a372 for the duties and \u00a31-6-8d for the barmastership.<ref name=\"Slack_a\"/>\n\n===Chief barmasters and the 24===\n\nAt dinner in Wirksworth after meetings of the 17th-century Barmote Court, the landlord of the inn had three tables for those attending the Court.<ref>Derbyshire Record Office, D 258/28/2a.</ref> There was the \"24 table\", where the members of the 24-man jury sat, and where he charged 8d per head, \"the barmasters' table\", at 10d a head, and a table where \"gentlemen's dinners\" cost 1 shilling each. The gentlemen drank sack or [[claret]] with their dinner; the men were served with beer. The bill was paid by the king's farmer and chief barmaster. There were usually about a dozen gentlemen, some of whom were members of the jury, while others were there to present a case to the Court. Also among the gentlemen were the steward of the court, who was a lawyer and who conducted the sessions. When the chief barmaster for the Wapentake, always a man of wealth and rank, was a local gentleman such as Sir John Gell of Hopton<ref name=\"Slack_a\" /> or his son John, the 2nd baronet, he often attended the Court himself. If the current chief barmaster was an absentee member of the gentry or nobility he relied on his deputy barmasters.\n\nIn addition to helping the barmasters to carry out their duties the 24 jurors brought practical experience to bear when the Barmote Court was adjudicating in disputes and trials. The main requirement of the jurymen was that they should be knowledgeable in mining matters and they included both working miners and, when it was thought necessary, local gentry.\n\n===Deputy barmasters===\n\nThe deputy barmasters whom the chief barmaster appointed were experienced local men. Some of them were yeoman farmer/miners and others local gentlemen.<ref>Slack 1991</ref>  The deputy barmasters actually ran the system. It was they who initiated much of the business of the Court. It was they, in administering the rules, who determined whether a miner should have a particular mine or whether another should lose one. Their duties required them to be able to read, write and keep account of granting and removing title to mines and of ore production and the duties levied on it. As ore was brought from a mine, it was measured by the dish and the barmaster collected each 13th dish, a royalty or duty known as ''lot''. This was the barmaster's ''reckoning''. A further duty of sixpence a load (9 dishes) was paid by the merchants who bought the ore from the miners. This second duty was called ''cope''.\n\n===Giving a mine===\n\nThe barmaster or his deputy granted title in a mine, the usual name for which was ''grove'' or ''groove'', on receipt of proof that it was viable. The proof was a standard container, a dish, filled with about {{convert|65|lb|kg|abbr=off}} of ore from the mine in question. Every dish was calibrated by the barmaster twice a year against a brass standard dish. The miner thus granted title to the mine was said to have ''freed'' it, either ''for old'' if a development in an existing mine, or ''for new'' in the case of a new discovery. He was given permission to work 2 ''meers'' of ground, known as ''founder meers'', with no restriction on width or depth. A third meer was the king's, and other miners were each allowed to open a further meer, ''taker meers'', along the vein. The miner marked each meer with his ''possessions'' or ''stows'' (a miniature version of the stows or windlass used to ''wind'' the ore from the shaft). A meer was {{convert|29|yd|m}}, in the Wirksworth Wapentake.\n\nSince the course of a vein of lead was unpredictable, there were many disputes caused by one group of miners following a vein into another mine. There were occasions when possession was disputed by physical means.\n\n===Title-holding and record keeping===\n\nThe deputy barmasters were responsible for settling disputes over ownership or of ''arresting'' or suspending operation of mines pending decisions of the Barmote Court. They could withdraw title whenever a mine was left unworked. They checked the mines regularly and used their knives to ''nick'' the stows at any neglected mine. After three nicks at weekly intervals title could be transferred to another miner. The mining rules required working shareholders in a mine to pull their weight. Any who did not were dispossessed, after a warning at the Barmote Court. Typical was this injunction from the court on 2 April 1630: \"Wee saie that Thomas Taylor Henry Lowe and John Wooley shall come within tenn daies of warning given them by the Barrmaster and shall keepe Thomas Redforde companie at their groves in Home Rake or else to loose theire parte.\"<ref>National Archive DL 30/54/669A</ref>\n\nThe deputy barmasters kept records of all changes of title and of the amounts of ore measured and the amounts of lot ore and cope collected at their regular ''reckonings'' at the mines. The lot and cope ''accounts'' involved quite complicated arithmetic. The information given included the period covered, the name of the miner or mine (occasionally both were given), the amount of ore mined, the number of dishes of lot ore received, the amount of ore sold to each buyer and the sum of money chargeable to each buyer for cope.<ref>Derbyshire Record Office D258/58/24</ref> Traditional methods were used at the reckonings; barmasters carried knives \"to worke uppon a sticke the nomber of dishes of oare as they were measured which is usuall to be done at a reckoning\".<ref name=\"DerbyshireRecord\">Derbyshire Record Office D258/30/16-24</ref> Many of their records have survived.\n\n===Accidents===\n\nIn conjunction with the jury of 24 sitting at the Barmote Courts, the deputy barmasters adjudicated in disputes and enforced compliance with the customs of the mines. Their duties extended to acting as the coroner in the case of fatal accidents, where a specially summoned jury of twelve or thirteen local miners decided the cause of death. In an 18th-century example the Brassington barmaster, Edward Ashton, followed the rules after a death in Throstle Nest mine.\n\n<blockquote>Wirksworth Wapentake March 26th 1761.\nWe, whose names are under written, being this day summoned by Mr. Edward Ashton, Bar-Master for the Liberty of Brassington, to a groove called by the name of Throstle Nest on Brassington Pasture; to enquire into the cause of the death of T.W. now lying before us; accordingly we have been down the shaft to the Foot thereof, and down one sump or turn to the foot thereof, and on a gate North-wardly about sixteen yards to the Forefield, where the deceased had been at work; and by the information of William Briddon who was working near him; it appears that a large stone fell upon him out of the roof, and it is our opinions the said stone was the cause of his death.<ref>Hardy 1762</ref></blockquote>\n[[File:minphot2.jpg|thumb|Datestone of TW, the miner killed in Throstlenest Mine in 1761, carved on limestone outcrop a few feet from the mineshaft]]\n\n===Structure of industry===\n\nThe free mining arrangement under the rules of the Duchy of Lancaster was the normal state of affairs in the Duchy manor of Wirksworth. The Duchy's lessee of the mineral rights at the end of the 16th century, Gilbert, Earl of Shrewsbury, had established his right to the dues of lot and cope against attempts by local landowners to assert right to mines on their land.<ref>Wood 1999, p.207</ref> Shrewsbury's success embedded the old rules and facilitated free mining.\n\nThere was one independent area within the Wapentake, Griffe Grange, near Brassington, held by the Gell family of Hopton since Ralph Gell had leased it from Dale Abbey and bought it from the Crown Commissioners at the dissolution of the religious houses by Henry VIII.<ref>Derbyshire Record Office D258/53/3a,b,c</ref> The Gells, however, ran their mines under similar rules to those in the Duchy, the only difference being that the miners paid their dues to them.<ref>Derbyshire Record Office D258/20/7/1-40</ref> Attempts by other landowners to establish the same rights as the Gells were largely unsuccessful. An example occurred at [[Elton, Derbyshire|Elton]], where the landowner, Francis Foljambe, prevented the application of Duchy rules, employing wage labourers in the Elton mines and seeking sanction for his action in the courts. The Duchy Court, however, issued an injunction against him in 1627, instructing him \"to conveane or execute noe other suite or suites hereafter att the Comon Lawe ... concerning the lott and copp and lead mynes in Elton\".<ref name=\"DerbyshireRecord\" /> This ruling was applied in all the Duchy liberties, though there was a renewal of opposition from landowners after the Restoration of 1660.\n\nFor historical reasons the structure of the industry was different in the High Peak where, mainly because of very long leases, there had been a blurring of the Duchy's authority, and the two largest landowners, the Manners and Cavendish families, maintained claims to mining rights and dues.<ref>Wood 1999, pp.238\u2013248</ref> The miners fought hard, physically and in the courts, to obtain the free mining rights enjoyed in the Wirksworth Wapentake. The Manners family met them head-on, refused all attempts to establish free mining, and employed miners as day labourers in their mines. Their Cavendish neighbours at Chatsworth, after a period of conflict, adopted the same pattern as the Gells at Griffe Grange, collecting the dues from mines run by Duchy of Lancaster rules.\n\nThe operation of the old rules and customs in the Wirksworth Wapentake did not prevent the development of a complicated structure there. The barmasters' ore accounts, identifying mines and/or proprietors, reveal a mixture of free mining, ownership of large mines by rich entrepreneurs and the rewashing of old spoil heaps. Where there was a rich source of ore and especially where access required dewatering, the mines were owned by venture capitalists employing miners either as contracted groups, who considered themselves as free miners negotiating a price for their work or, more rarely, as wage labourers. The barmasters' accounts for 1653<ref>Derbyshire Record Office D258/28/20c</ref> show that the ore from the Brassington, Middleton and Wirksworth liberties, all low producers at the time, consisted of small amounts mined by a large number of names. Clearly, in these liberties, at this time, it was the small-time miners, most of whom would have had other sources of income, usually farming, who were paying their dues and selling to the lead merchants and smelters. In a fourth liberty, Cromford, the picture was different. With the Dovegang dewatered by Vermuyden's Sough (see below), the output there dwarfed the combined output of the other three liberties, and 51% of it came from mines owned by the rich lead merchant Lionel Tynley. 88% came from four sources, while the rest was mined by 45 independent miners. Finally, 6,108 loads (about 1,527 tons), or 23% of the total ore sold in the four liberties, was won from old hillocks by so-called \"cavers\".\n\n==Pollution==\n\nLead is poisonous to both plants and animals. For people the smelting processes are the most dangerous \u2013 the restored smelter at Spitewinter, near Chesterfield, stands a few yards from Belland Lane, ''belland'' being lead poisoning. The current owners of the smelter on the site of the former Mill Close mine at Darley Bridge have bought much of the adjoining land and turned arable and pasture into woodland, to avoid the danger to crops and animals.\n\nThe danger to plants and animals, particularly from washing or \"buddling\", has been known for centuries and the nuisance to the people of Brassington described above was typical of the conflict between farmers and miners. In the 1680s Sir John Gell II gave his opinion during such a dispute. \"For buddling ... I have heard that miners have been indicted for it, and the freeholders and occupiers of land are much prejudiced by it. It sets the cattle upon the belland, which is destructive to the cattle and horses and often kills them.\"<ref>British Library, Add. MS. 6681, ff140-141 (microfilm copy in Matlock Local Studies Library).</ref>\n\nIn 1794 several groups of Wensley miners who had buddled mine waste in the river Derwent above and below Darley Bridge were brought to court, accused of polluting the river.<ref>British Library, Add. MS. 6676, ff132-160 (microfilm copy in Matlock Local Studies Library).</ref> Witnesses described the river as being muddied as far down-river as a mile below Cromford Bridge, and a Matlock publican claimed to have been prevented from his usual practice of using river water for his brewing by the state of the Derwent. He had had to sink a well to stay in business. Mining law was cited by both sides. The miners quoted the custom which allowed them to wash their ore, while plaintiffs replied with the law which stipulated that sludge from washing should be emptied into \"some convenient place within their quarter cord (which is a space of seven yards and a quarter, or the fourth part of a meer, on each side of their vein)\" to prevent pollution of the adjacent land. The miners, who had carted their ore to the river, as being easier than carting water to their mine \u2013 their mine was dry and there is a steep hill from Wensley to the Derwent \u2013 lost their case.\n[[File:minphot3.jpg|thumb|Settling pond for washing sludge at Corsehill Mine, Brassington]]\nIn addition to the mining law to prevent water pollution quoted in the Wensley case, often ignored by the miners, attempts to prevent pollution of farmland included tree planting to deter cattle from grazing near mining operations \u2013 there are many examples of trees planted on the lines of veins in the old mining areas as well as the recent afforestation at Darley Bridge. Smelting mills were provided with chimneys to dissipate the fumes from the ore hearths. These were only partly successful as the mills were often sited in or near to settlements, which suffered from lead deposits from the chimneys. The mills also polluted the streams which powered their bellows.<ref>Kiernan 1989, p.157</ref>  Cupolas, described below, conveyed their emissions via tunnels to chimneys, which were often a considerable distance from the smelter. The limited success achieved by these efforts is exemplified by the naming of Belland Lane.\n\n==Mine drainage==\n\nUntil the 17th century mining had usually been abandoned when the work reached the water table. Efforts at draining lead mines by horse-powered pumps, or \u201cengines\u201d, had little success. In the later years of the industry mines were successfully drained by hydraulic, steam, internal combustion and electric power, but the first successes were achieved by soughs, drainage tunnels driven into flooded veins to allow the water to run off.<ref>Rieuwerts 1987</ref> Dr Rieuwerts has provided a comprehensive gazetteer of the Derbyshire lead mining soughs. By lowering the water table and opening up large new deposits of lead ore, they transformed the industry.\n\nThe first [[sough]], designed by Sir [[Cornelius Vermuyden]], knighted for his work in draining the East Anglian fens, was driven over a twenty-year period from a point on Cromford Hill, between [[Cromford]] and [[Wirksworth]], into an area called the Dovegang. When it was completed in 1652 there was an immediate jump in ore production in the area. Vermuyden's was followed by a succession of soughs which by the end of the century had drained enough of the mines in the Wirksworth Wapentake to cause a dramatic rise in production in the whole area. The most important were the Cromford Sough, which was over thirty years in driving, between 1662 and 1696, and was continued in the 18th century, and Hannage Sough, begun in 1693 and also continued into the next century. The Cromford Sough provided the power for [[Richard Arkwright]]'s mills at Cromford, the first of which was built in 1771. Also among the important 17th century soughs were the Raventor, begun in 1655, Bates (1657\u201384), Lees (1664), and Baileycroft (1667\u201373). The Baileycroft Sough drained mines in Wirksworth. Those in the area just to the north of Wirksworth called the Gulf were drained by the Raventor and Lees Soughs. The Bates and Cromford Soughs drained mines on Cromford Moor \u2014 Bates Sough had reached the Dovegang by 1684. Hannage Sough drained the area to the east of Yokecliffe Rake, on the south of Wirksworth.\n\nDrainage of the mines in the whole of the Wirksworth area was eventually accomplished by the Meerbrook Sough, begun at the level of the river Derwent in 1772, at a time when lead-mining ventures had become only intermittently profitable. The entrance to this sough is {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=off}} wide and {{convert|8|ft|m|abbr=off}} high and has a keystone inscribed \u201cFH 1772\u201d. FH was Francis Hurt of Alderwasley, smelter, lead mine shareholder, iron-master and the main shareholder in the sough. It still discharges {{convert|12|e6impgal|m3}} to {{convert|20|e6impgal|m3}} a day, and by the 1830s had so reduced the flow from the Cromford Sough that in 1846 Richard Arkwright's successor had to end production at the Cromford mills.<ref>Cooper, B. 1983, p.78</ref>\nIn other areas the Mill Close mines between Winster and Wensley, and the mines of Youlgreave were soughed.\n\n==Cupola smelting ==\n\nThe mills which had superseded the ancient bolehills in the late 16th century, a development described above, were themselves superseded in the 18th century by the gradual introduction of a new type of furnace known as the [[Reverberatory furnace|cupola]].<ref>Willies 1990</ref>\n\nThe old mills had a number of disadvantages. Their characteristic overheating and dissemination of polluting fumes made it necessary to close the smelter down at the end of each day's work. The hearth burned out quickly and regular weekly repairs or rebuilding were necessary \u2013 between 24 June and 29 September 1657, for instance, thirteen new hearths were required at the Upper Mill in [[Wirksworth]].<ref>Derbyshire Record Office, D 258/61/49b.</ref> Water-powered smelting mills were restricted to riverside sites and \u201cwhite coal\u201d fuel required a good supply of timber. By the 18th century timber supplies were running out and, where [[coke (fuel)|coke]] or coal was used because of timber shortages, impurities, particularly sulphur, were introduced into the lead. It was, finally, less efficient than the cupola.\n\nThe cupola was a [[reverberatory furnace]]. The fuel was burned in a combustion chamber at the side of the furnace, separate from the \u201ccharge\u201d of ore, thus avoiding any contamination. This removed the disadvantage in using coal, which was far more plentiful than timber. The ore was loaded from a hopper into a concave furnace with a low, arched roof and a tall chimney or a flue at the opposite end from the combustion chamber. The flames and heated gases from the fuel were drawn across the charge by the draught from the chimney and beaten down by reverberation from the low roof. Slag on the surface of the molten lead was raked off and the lead itself poured into an iron pot at the side, before being ladled into moulds.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the cupola's greater efficiency than the smelting mill. Unlike the smelting mill, the cupola could be operated continuously. Since the air flow over the ore was less powerful than that from the bellows of the blast furnace fewer lead particles were blown away. Further lead was saved by the fact that since the fuel and the charge were separate none of the lead was lost into the ash. Since no water power was needed the cupola had a fourth theoretical advantage of being freed from the riverside location of the blast furnace, and able to be placed in the most convenient site for supply of ore and coal. However, the higher temperatures needed to melt the slag recovered from the primary melt required a water-powered furnace and, since slag mills tended to be placed next to the cupolas, most cupolas remained in riverside sites.\n\nMany cupolas had long horizontal flues, which were introduced to trap pollutants before they could be discharged into the air. Since the pollutants included metal vapour, the sweepings of the flue could also be recovered for resmelting.\n\n==Closure==\n\nThe Derbyshire lead industry declined after the late 18th century because of worked-out veins, increased production costs and the discovery of much cheaper foreign sources. The industry was protected from this foreign ore by import duty in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. A reduction in the duty in 1820 and its abolition in 1845<ref>6 Geo IV c104 & 8 & 9 Vic. c.90 respectively (quoted in Burt,1984, p.235)</ref> brought a steep rise in the volume of lead imported into England and accelerated the local industry's decline.\n\nThere were still bursts of high production, and indeed the output of certain mines during the 18th and 19th centuries exceeded anything achieved in the 17th century; over 2658 loads (about 641 [[long ton|ton]]s or 651 [[tonne|metric tonnes]]) were mined at Brassington, traditionally an area of low output, in 1862.<ref>Chatsworth House. Barmaster's Collection. Transcript Roger Flindall</ref>  At a meeting of the Barmote Court in Wirksworth in 1862 one mine owner announced \"that by perseverance for upwards of twenty years, they had at last found the long sought for treasure, which he hoped would be prosperous, and they should be able to continue employing, as they are at the present time, upwards of 100 men at one mine in Brassington\".<ref>''Derby & Chesterfield Reporter'', 2 May 1862, p.8, col.6</ref>  However, by 1901 the number of men employed in all the Derbyshire lead mines had fallen to 285<ref>Ford, TD and Rieuwerts, JH, 2000, p.60</ref> most of whom worked at the [[Mill Close Mine]] at Darley Bridge. Mill Close, the biggest lead mine in the country, took the Derbyshire lead industry into the 20th century, and just before its enforced closure in 1939, caused by flooding, employed about 600 men.<ref>Willies 1989</ref> The smelter at Mill Close, established in 1934, was bought in 1941 by H J Enthoven and Sons, a London-based lead producer, and still operates.\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Derbyshire}}\n* [[Odin Mine]]\n* [[Beans and Bacon mine]]\n* [[Peak District Mining Museum]]\n* [[Killhope Wheel]], Lead Mining Museum, Co.

Alongside the bishop's [[Episcopal see|see]], the canonical settlement [[Kaptol, Zagreb|Kaptol]] developed north of [[Zagreb Cathedral]], as did the fortified settlement [[Gradec, Zagreb|Gradec]] on the neighbouring hill; the border between the two being the Medve\u0161\u010dak stream. Today the latter is Zagreb's Upper Town ([[Gornji Grad \u2013 Medve\u0161\u010dak|Gornji Grad]]) and is one of the best preserved urban nuclei in [[Croatia]]. Both settlements came under [[Tatars|Tatar]] attack in 1242. As a sign of gratitude for offering him a safe haven from the [[Tatars]] the Croatian and Hungarian [[B\u00e9la IV of Hungary|King Bela IV]] bestowed Gradec with a [[Golden Bull of 1242|Golden Bull]], which offered its citizens exemption from county rule and autonomy, as well as its own [[judiciary|judicial system]].\n\n===16th to 18th centuries===\nThere were numerous connections between the Kaptol diocese and the free sovereign town of Gradec for both economic and political reasons, but they weren't known as an integrated city, even as Zagreb became the political centre and, representing both Croatia, [[Slavonia]] and [[Dalmatia]], first convened at Gradec. Zagreb was chosen as the seat of the [[Ban of Croatia]] in 1621 under ban [[Nikola Frankopan]].\n\nAt the invitation of the [[Croatian Parliament]], the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] came to Zagreb and built the first [[grammar school]], the [[Catherine of Alexandria|St. Catherine's]] Church and monastery. In 1669, they founded an academy where philosophy, theology and law were taught, the forerunner of today's [[University of Zagreb]].\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries, Zagreb was badly devastated by fire and [[Bubonic plague|the plague]]. In 1776, the royal council (government) moved from [[Vara\u017edin]] to Zagreb and during the reign of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] Zagreb became the headquarters of the [[Vara\u017edin]] and [[Karlovac]] general command.<ref name=\"HRT\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.hrt.hr/arhiv/hrvati_u_svijetu/upoznajte_hrvatsku/03_glavni_grad_hrvatske/zagreb_eng.html\n|title=The city of Zagreb\n|work=hrt.hr\n|publisher=[[Croatian Radiotelevision]]\n|accessdate=2 July 2006\n|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070117124718/http://www.hrt.hr/arhiv/hrvati_u_svijetu/upoznajte_hrvatsku/03_glavni_grad_hrvatske/zagreb_eng.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate= 17 January 2007}}</ref>\n\n===19th to mid-20th century===\n\n<!--''Political history is missing'' (March 2013)-->\nIn the 19th century, Zagreb was the centre of the [[Illyrian movement|Croatian National Revival]] and saw the erection of important cultural and historic institutions.\nIn 1850, the town was united under its first [[List of mayors of Zagreb|mayor]] \u2013 [[Janko Kamauf]].<ref name=\"HRT\"/>\n\nThe first [[rail transport|railway]] line to connect Zagreb with [[Zidani Most]] and [[Sisak]] was opened in 1862 and in 1863 Zagreb received a [[gasworks]].

In 1926, the first [[radio broadcasting|radio station]] in the region began broadcasting from Zagreb, and in 1947 the [[Zagreb Fair]] was opened.<ref name=\"HRT\"/>\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Zagreb became the capital of the [[Independent State of Croatia]], which was backed by [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Fascism in Italy|Italians]]. The history of [[Zagreb in World War II]] became rife with incidents of regime terror and resistance sabotage, and the [[Usta\u0161a]] regime had thousands of people executed during the war in and near the city. The city was taken by the [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Partisans]] at the end of the war. From 1945 until 1990, Zagreb was the capital of the [[Socialist Republic of Croatia]], one of the six constituent socialist republics of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]].\n\n===Modern Zagreb===\n[[File:Zagreb trg bana Jela\u010di\u0107a.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Ban Jela\u010di\u0107 Square]]]]\n[[File:19-06-16-Zagreb-DJI_0181.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|King Tomislav Square]]\nThe area between the railway and the [[Sava]] river witnessed a new construction boom after [[World War II]]. After the mid-1950s, construction of new residential areas south of the [[Sava]] river began, resulting in [[Novi Zagreb]] (Croatian for ''New Zagreb''), originally called \"Ju\u017eni Zagreb\" (Southern Zagreb).<ref name=juzni_zagreb>{{cite journal |url=http://www.zarez.hr/222/z_socijalna.html |title=O imaginarnim kartama Ju\u017enog= Novog Zagreba |journal=Zarez |last=Mareti\u0107 |first=Mirko |issue=\u2116 222 |date=10 January 2008 |accessdate=25 February 2009  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515163924/http://www.zarez.hr/222/z_socijalna.html |archive-date=15 May 2009 |language=Croatian}}</ref> \nToday Novi Zagreb is divided in two [[city districts]]: [[Novi Zagreb-zapad]] ([[Novi Zagreb-zapad|West\nNovi Zagreb]]) and [[Novi Zagreb-istok]] ([[Novi Zagreb-istok|East Novi Zagreb]])\n\nThe city also expanded westward and eastward, incorporating [[Dubrava, Zagreb|Dubrava]], Podsused, [[Jarun]], [[Blato, Zagreb|Blato]] and other settlements.\nThe cargo railway hub and the [[international airport]] [[Zagreb Airport|Pleso]] were built south of the [[Sava]] river. The largest [[industrial district|industrial zone]] (\u017ditnjak) in the south-eastern part of the city represents an extension of the industrial zones on the eastern outskirts of the city, between the [[Sava]] and the Prigorje region. Zagreb also hosted the [[1987 Summer Universiade|Summer Universiade]] in 1987.<ref name=\"HRT\"/>\n\nDuring the 1991\u20131995 [[Croatian War of Independence]], it was a scene of some [[Battle of the Barracks|sporadic fighting]] surrounding its [[Yugoslav People's Army|JNA]] [[barracks|army barracks]], but escaped major damage. In May 1995, it was targeted by Serb [[rocket artillery]] in two [[Zagreb rocket attacks|rocket attacks]] which killed seven civilians.\n\nAn urbanised area connects Zagreb with the surrounding towns of [[Zapre\u0161i\u0107]], [[Samobor]], [[Dugo Selo]] and [[Velika Gorica]]. Sesvete was the first and the closest area to become a part of the [[urban agglomeration|agglomeration]] and is already included in the City of Zagreb for administrative purposes and now forms the easternmost city district.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dzs.hr/Eng/censuses/Census2001/Popis/E01_01_03/e01_01_03_zup22.html |title=SAS Output |publisher=Dzs.hr |accessdate=15 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2020 the city was hit by a 5.5 magnitude earthquake. Various buildings in the historic downtown area were damaged. The city's iconic cathedral lost the cross off of one of its towers. This earthquake was the strongest one since the one that occurred 140 years prior in 1880.\n\n===Area and population development===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\" |+ '''Cells left-aligned, table centred'''\n|-\n! style=\"width:50px;\"|Year\n! style=\"width:80px;\"|Area <br/>(km<sup>2</sup>)\n! style=\"width:80px;\"|Population <br/>(within city limits at that time)\n! style=\"width:80px;\"|Population <br/>(within today's city limits)\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1368\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|2,810<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"ex02\">from the household census</ref>\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1742\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|3.33\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|5,600<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"ex02\"/>\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1805\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|3.33\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|7,706<ref group=\"nb\">population census without clergy and nobility</ref>(~11 000 in total)\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1850\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|25.4\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|16,036\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1857\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|25.4\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|16,657\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|48,266\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1869\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|25.4\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|19,857\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|54,761\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1880\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|25.4\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|30,830\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|67,188\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1890\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|25.4\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|40,268\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|82,848\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1900\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|64.37\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|61,002\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|111,565\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1910\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|64.37\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|79,038\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|136,351\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1921\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|64.37\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|108,674\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|167,765\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1931\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|64.37\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|185,581\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|258,024\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1948\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|74.99\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|279,623\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|356,529\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1953\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|235.74\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|350,829\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|393,919\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1961\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|495.60\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|430,802\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|478,076\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1971\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|497.95\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|602,205\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|629,896\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1981\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|1,261.54\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|768,700\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|723,065\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1991\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|1,715.55\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|933,914\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|777,826\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|2001\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|641.36\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|779,145\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|779,145\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|2011\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|641.36\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|792,875\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|792,875\n|-\n|colspan=5 |<small>The data in column 3 refers to the population in the city borders as of the census in question.

Zagreb has four separate [[season]]s. Summers are generally warm, sometimes hot. In late May it gets significantly warmer, temperatures start rising and it is often pleasant with frequent afternoon and evening thunderstorms. Heatwaves can occur but are short-lived. Temperatures rise above {{convert|30|C}} on an average 14.6 days each summer. Rainfall is abundant in the summertime and it continues to be in autumn as well. With 840&nbsp;mm of precipitation per year, Zagreb is Europe's 9th wettest capital, receiving less precipitation than Luxembourg but more than [[Brussels]], [[Paris]] and [[London]]. [[Autumn]] in its early stages is often mild and sunny with occasional episodes of rain. Autumn is characterised by an increase in rainy days as well as by temperature averages that steadily fall towards the end of the season. Morning [[fog]] is common from mid-October to January, with northern city districts at the foothills of the [[Medvednica]] mountain as well as those districts along the [[Sava]] river being more prone to all-day fog accumulation. Winters are relatively cold with a precipitation decrease pattern. February is the driest month, averaging 39&nbsp;mm of precipitation. On average there are 29 days with snowfall, with first snow usually falling in early December. However, in recent years, the number of snowy days has decreased sharply. Springs are generally mild and pleasant with frequent weather changes and are windier than other seasons. Sometimes cold spells can occur, mostly in its early stages. The average daily mean temperature in the winter is around {{convert|1|\u00b0C}} (from December to February) and the average temperature in the summer is {{convert|22.0|C|1}}.<ref name= normals

The Sava and the [[Kupa (river)|Kupa]] valleys are to the south of Zagreb, and the region of [[Hrvatsko Zagorje]] is located on the other (northern) side of the Medvednica hill. In mid-January 2005, Sljeme held its first [[FIS Alpine World Ski Championships|World Ski Championship tournament]].\n\nFrom the summit, weather permitting, the vista reaches as far as [[Velebit]] Range along Croatia's rocky northern coast, as well as the snow-capped peaks of the towering [[Julian Alps]] in neighbouring [[Slovenia]]. There are several lodging villages, offering accommodation and restaurants for hikers. Skiers visit Sljeme, which has four ski-runs, three ski-lifts and a chairlift.\n\nThe old [[Medvedgrad]], a recently restored medieval [[wikt:Special:Search/burg|burg]] was built in the 13th century on Medvednica hill. It overlooks the western part of the city and also hosts the ''Shrine of the Homeland'', a memorial with an [[eternal flame]], where Croatia pays reverence to all its heroes fallen for [[homeland]] in its history, customarily on [[Public holiday|national holiday]]s. The ruined medieval fortress [[Susedgrad]] is located on far-western side of Medvednica hill. It has been abandoned since the early 17th century, but it is visited during the year.\n\nZagreb occasionally experiences earthquakes, due to the proximity of [[\u017dumberak]]-[[Medvednica]] fault zone.<ref>[http://www2.ogs.trieste.it/gngts/gngts/convegniprecedenti/2008/riassunti/1.1/11-toml.pdf SEISMOGENIC ZONES OF NORTHWESTERN CROATIA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206110700/http://www2.ogs.trieste.it/gngts/gngts/convegniprecedenti/2008/riassunti/1.1/11-toml.pdf |date=6 February 2016 }} GNGTS 2008</ref> It's classified as an area of high seismic activity.<ref name=\"embassy earthquake\">{{cite web|url=http://zagreb.usembassy.gov/service/special-consular-services/emergency-and-medical-issues/earthquake.html|title=Earthquake \u2013 Zagreb, Croatia \u2013 Embassy of the United States|work=usembassy.gov|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206090402/http://zagreb.usembassy.gov/service/special-consular-services/emergency-and-medical-issues/earthquake.html|archivedate=6 February 2016}}</ref> The area around Medvednica was the epicentre of the [[1880 Zagreb earthquake]] (magnitude 6.3), and the area is known for occasional landslide threatening houses in the area.<ref name=\"landslide survey croatian\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hgi-cgs.hr/zagreb_potresi.html|title=Potresi na zagreba\u010dkom podru\u010dju|last=dpuljic|work=hgi-cgs.hr}}</ref> The proximity of strong seismic sources presents a real danger of strong earthquakes.<ref name=\"landslide survey croatian\"/> Croatian Chief of [[Office of Emergency Management]] Pavle Kalini\u0107 stated Zagreb experiences around 400 earthquakes a year, most of them being imperceptible.

Since the end of the [[History of Croatia|war]], it has attracted close to a million visitors annually, mainly from [[Austria]], [[Germany]] and [[Italy]], and in recent years many tourists from far east (South Korea, Japan, China, and last two years, from India). It has become an important tourist destination, not only in Croatia, but considering the whole region of southeastern Europe. There are many interesting sights and happenings for tourists to attend in Zagreb, for example, the two statues of Saint George, one at the [[Republic of Croatia Square]], the other at [[Stone Gate|Kamenita vrata]], where the image of Virgin Mary is said to be only thing that hasn't burned in the 17th-century fire. Also, there is an art installation starting in Bogovi\u0107eva street, called [[Nine Views]]. Most people don't know what the statue \"Prizemljeno Sunce\" (The Grounded Sun) is for, and just scrawl graffiti or signatures on it, but it's actually the Sun scaled down, with many planets situated all over Zagreb in scale with the Sun. There are also many festivals and events throughout the year, which made Zagreb a year-round tourist destination for many years already.\n\nThe historical part of the city to the north of [[Ban Jela\u010di\u0107 Square]] is composed of the [[Gradec, Zagreb|Gornji Grad]] and [[Kaptol, Zagreb|Kaptol]], a medieval urban complex of churches, palaces, museums, galleries and government buildings that are popular with tourists on sightseeing tours. The historic district can be reached on foot, starting from [[Jela\u010di\u0107 Square]], the centre of Zagreb, or by a [[funicular]] on nearby Tomi\u0107eva Street. Each Saturday, (from April till the end of September), on [[St. Mark's Square, Zagreb|St. Mark's Square]] in the [[Gradec, Zagreb|Upper town]], tourists can meet members of the Order of The Silver Dragon (Red Srebrnog Zmaja), who reenact famous historical conflicts between [[Gradec, Zagreb County|Gradec]] and [[Kaptol, Zagreb|Kaptol]]. It's a great opportunity for all visitors to take photographs of authentic and fully functional historical replicas of medieval armour.\n\nIn 2010 more than 600,000<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poslovni.hr/vijesti/grad-zagreb-u-2010-broj-turistickih-dolazaka-veci-za-4-posto-168991.aspx |title=Broj turistickih dolazaka|publisher=poslovni.hr|accessdate=12 January 2012}}</ref> tourists visited the city, with a 10%<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kigo.hr/tekst/11098.html |title=Broj turista najvise porastao u Zagrebu |publisher=kigo.hr |accessdate=12 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130301124403/http://www.kigo.hr/tekst/11098.html |archivedate=1 March 2013}}</ref> increase seen in 2011.

The number of cars in the city centre is rising by 4% every year and current traffic levels require a widening of the road infrastructure. A particular problem is [[Ilica (street)|Ilica]] Street, which has high amounts of both car, tram and pedestrian traffic. Any widening of this street would take some space from the pedestrians. The tunnels would triple the downtown road capacity and allow the cars to travel at {{convert|50|km/h|abbr=on}} at [[peak hour]]. The seven tunnels would also help solve the problem of the unfinished [[Sljeme tunnel]], which has been a citywide nuisance for a long time.\n\nThe proposed tunnels would have an underground interchange near Jabukovac street in the hills north of the city centre. Three tunnels (one of which would have two tubes) would connect the future Jabukovac interchange with the city centre. Another tunnel would connect Jabukovac to [[Gup\u010deva zvijezda]], one would go to Zelengaj north of Britanski square and the third one would go to Von\u010dinina Street, about {{convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of Jabukovac. There would also be a tunnel connecting Dra\u0161kovi\u0107eva Street to [[Ribnjak, Zagreb]], eliminating the current long and often congested bypass which uses smaller streets near [[\u017drtava Fa\u0161izma Square]].\n\nShould the proposal be accepted, it would take three years to build the tunnels.<ref name=tuneli>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.sutra.hr/gradski-ritam/tunelima-kroz-centar-zagreba\n|title=Tunelima kroz centar Zagreba\n|accessdate=27 November 2007\n|last=\u0160imunovi\u0107\n|first=Damjan\n|date=24 November 2007\n|work=Sutra.hr\n|language=Croatian\n}}</ref>\n -->\n\n====Public transportation====\n[[File:Estaci\u00f3n Principal de FF.CC., Zagreb, Croacia, 2014-04-20, DD 03.JPG|thumb|right|[[Zagreb Glavni kolodvor|Main Railway Station]]]]\n[[File:Sede de los Ferrocarriles Croatas, Zagreb, Croacia, 2014-04-13, DD 01.JPG|thumb|right|[[Croatian Railways|Croatian Railways headquarters]]]]\n\n[[File:ZET tram&bus.jpg|thumb|right|[[Zagreba\u010dki elektri\u010dni tramvaj|ZET]] tram and city bus]]\n[[File:H\u017d Class 6112 1.JPG|thumb|right|[[H\u017d series 6112|Newest model]] of the Zagreb city trains system]]\n[[Public transport]]ation in the city is organised in several layers: the inner parts of the city are mostly covered by [[tram]]s, the outer city areas and closer suburbs are linked with [[bus]]es and rapid transit [[Zagreb Commuter Rail|commuter rail]].\n\nThe public transportation company [[Zagreba\u010dki elektri\u010dni tramvaj|ZET]] (''Zagreba\u010dki elektri\u010dni tramvaj'', Zagreb Electric Tram) operates trams, all inner bus lines, and the most of the suburban bus lines, and it is subsidised by the city council.\n\nThe national rail operator [[Croatian Railways]] (''Hrvatske \u017eeljeznice'', H\u017d) runs a network of urban and suburban train lines in the metropolitan Zagreb area, and is a [[government-owned corporation]].\n\nThe [[funicular]] (''uspinja\u010da'') in the historic part of the city is a [[tourist attraction]].\n\n[[Taxicab|Taxi]] market has been liberalized in early 2018<ref>{{cite web|url=https://vlada.gov.hr/vijesti/ministar-butkovic-novim-zakonom-o-prijevozu-u-cestovnom-prometu-jeftiniji-i-dostupniji-taksi-za-sve-gradjane/23630 |title=Ministar Butkovi\u0107: Novim Zakonom o prijevozu u cestovnom prometu jeftiniji i dostupniji taksi za sve gra\u0111ane |publisher=Government of the Republic of Croatia }}</ref> and numerous transport companies have been allowed to enter the market; consequently, the prices significantly dropped whereas the service was immensely improved so the popularity of taxis in Zagreb has been increasing from then onwards.\n\n=====Tram network=====\n{{main|Trams in Zagreb}}\nZagreb has an extensive [[tram]] network with 15-day and 4 night lines covering much of the inner- and middle-suburbs of the city.

Alongside the bishop's [[Episcopal see|see]], the canonical settlement [[Kaptol, Zagreb|Kaptol]] developed north of [[Zagreb Cathedral]], as did the fortified settlement [[Gradec, Zagreb|Gradec]] on the neighbouring hill; the border between the two being the Medve\u0161\u010dak stream. Today the latter is Zagreb's Upper Town ([[Gornji Grad \u2013 Medve\u0161\u010dak|Gornji Grad]]) and is one of the best preserved urban nuclei in [[Croatia]]. Both settlements came under [[Tatars|Tatar]] attack in 1242. As a sign of gratitude for offering him a safe haven from the [[Tatars]] the Croatian and Hungarian [[B\u00e9la IV of Hungary|King Bela IV]] bestowed Gradec with a [[Golden Bull of 1242|Golden Bull]], which offered its citizens exemption from county rule and autonomy, as well as its own [[judiciary|judicial system]].\n\n===16th to 18th centuries===\nThere were numerous connections between the Kaptol diocese and the free sovereign town of Gradec for both economic and political reasons, but they weren't known as an integrated city, even as Zagreb became the political centre and, representing both Croatia, [[Slavonia]] and [[Dalmatia]], first convened at Gradec. Zagreb was chosen as the seat of the [[Ban of Croatia]] in 1621 under ban [[Nikola Frankopan]].\n\nAt the invitation of the [[Croatian Parliament]], the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] came to Zagreb and built the first [[grammar school]], the [[Catherine of Alexandria|St. Catherine's]] Church and monastery. In 1669, they founded an academy where philosophy, theology and law were taught, the forerunner of today's [[University of Zagreb]].\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries, Zagreb was badly devastated by fire and [[Bubonic plague|the plague]]. In 1776, the royal council (government) moved from [[Vara\u017edin]] to Zagreb and during the reign of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] Zagreb became the headquarters of the [[Vara\u017edin]] and [[Karlovac]] general command.<ref name=\"HRT\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.hrt.hr/arhiv/hrvati_u_svijetu/upoznajte_hrvatsku/03_glavni_grad_hrvatske/zagreb_eng.html\n|title=The city of Zagreb\n|work=hrt.hr\n|publisher=[[Croatian Radiotelevision]]\n|accessdate=2 July 2006\n|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070117124718/http://www.hrt.hr/arhiv/hrvati_u_svijetu/upoznajte_hrvatsku/03_glavni_grad_hrvatske/zagreb_eng.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate= 17 January 2007}}</ref>\n\n===19th to mid-20th century===\n\n<!--''Political history is missing'' (March 2013)-->\nIn the 19th century, Zagreb was the centre of the [[Illyrian movement|Croatian National Revival]] and saw the erection of important cultural and historic institutions.\nIn 1850, the town was united under its first [[List of mayors of Zagreb|mayor]] \u2013 [[Janko Kamauf]].<ref name=\"HRT\"/>\n\nThe first [[rail transport|railway]] line to connect Zagreb with [[Zidani Most]] and [[Sisak]] was opened in 1862 and in 1863 Zagreb received a [[gasworks]].

In 1926, the first [[radio broadcasting|radio station]] in the region began broadcasting from Zagreb, and in 1947 the [[Zagreb Fair]] was opened.<ref name=\"HRT\"/>\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Zagreb became the capital of the [[Independent State of Croatia]], which was backed by [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Fascism in Italy|Italians]]. The history of [[Zagreb in World War II]] became rife with incidents of regime terror and resistance sabotage, and the [[Usta\u0161a]] regime had thousands of people executed during the war in and near the city. The city was taken by the [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Partisans]] at the end of the war. From 1945 until 1990, Zagreb was the capital of the [[Socialist Republic of Croatia]], one of the six constituent socialist republics of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]].\n\n===Modern Zagreb===\n[[File:Zagreb - 2015 - panoramio (5).jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Ban Jela\u010di\u0107 Square]]]]\n[[File:19-06-16-Zagreb-DJI_0181.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|King Tomislav Square]]\nThe area between the railway and the [[Sava]] river witnessed a new construction boom after [[World War II]]. After the mid-1950s, construction of new residential areas south of the [[Sava]] river began, resulting in [[Novi Zagreb]] (Croatian for ''New Zagreb''), originally called \"Ju\u017eni Zagreb\" (Southern Zagreb).<ref name=juzni_zagreb>{{cite journal |url=http://www.zarez.hr/222/z_socijalna.html |title=O imaginarnim kartama Ju\u017enog= Novog Zagreba |journal=Zarez |last=Mareti\u0107 |first=Mirko |issue=\u2116 222 |date=10 January 2008 |accessdate=25 February 2009  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515163924/http://www.zarez.hr/222/z_socijalna.html |archive-date=15 May 2009 |language=Croatian}}</ref> \nToday Novi Zagreb is divided in two [[city districts]]: [[Novi Zagreb-zapad]] ([[Novi Zagreb-zapad|West\nNovi Zagreb]]) and [[Novi Zagreb-istok]] ([[Novi Zagreb-istok|East Novi Zagreb]])\n\nThe city also expanded westward and eastward, incorporating [[Dubrava, Zagreb|Dubrava]], Podsused, [[Jarun]], [[Blato, Zagreb|Blato]] and other settlements.\nThe cargo railway hub and the [[international airport]] [[Zagreb Airport|Pleso]] were built south of the [[Sava]] river. The largest [[industrial district|industrial zone]] (\u017ditnjak) in the south-eastern part of the city represents an extension of the industrial zones on the eastern outskirts of the city, between the [[Sava]] and the Prigorje region. Zagreb also hosted the [[1987 Summer Universiade|Summer Universiade]] in 1987.<ref name=\"HRT\"/>\n\nDuring the 1991\u20131995 [[Croatian War of Independence]], it was a scene of some [[Battle of the Barracks|sporadic fighting]] surrounding its [[Yugoslav People's Army|JNA]] [[barracks|army barracks]], but escaped major damage. In May 1995, it was targeted by Serb [[rocket artillery]] in two [[Zagreb rocket attacks|rocket attacks]] which killed seven civilians.\n\nAn urbanised area connects Zagreb with the surrounding towns of [[Zapre\u0161i\u0107]], [[Samobor]], [[Dugo Selo]] and [[Velika Gorica]]. Sesvete was the first and the closest area to become a part of the [[urban agglomeration|agglomeration]] and is already included in the City of Zagreb for administrative purposes and now forms the easternmost city district.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dzs.hr/Eng/censuses/Census2001/Popis/E01_01_03/e01_01_03_zup22.html |title=SAS Output |publisher=Dzs.hr |accessdate=15 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2020 the city was hit by a 5.5 magnitude earthquake. Various buildings in the historic downtown area were damaged. The city's iconic cathedral lost the cross off of one of its towers. This earthquake was the strongest one since the one that occurred 140 years prior in 1880.\n\n===Area and population development===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\" |+ '''Cells left-aligned, table centred'''\n|-\n! style=\"width:50px;\"|Year\n! style=\"width:80px;\"|Area <br/>(km<sup>2</sup>)\n! style=\"width:80px;\"|Population <br/>(within city limits at that time)\n! style=\"width:80px;\"|Population <br/>(within today's city limits)\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1368\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|2,810<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"ex02\">from the household census</ref>\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1742\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|3.33\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|5,600<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"ex02\"/>\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1805\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|3.33\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|7,706<ref group=\"nb\">population census without clergy and nobility</ref>(~11 000 in total)\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1850\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|25.4\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|16,036\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1857\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|25.4\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|16,657\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|48,266\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1869\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|25.4\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|19,857\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|54,761\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1880\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|25.4\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|30,830\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|67,188\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1890\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|25.4\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|40,268\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|82,848\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1900\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|64.37\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|61,002\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|111,565\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1910\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|64.37\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|79,038\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|136,351\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1921\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|64.37\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|108,674\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|167,765\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1931\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|64.37\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|185,581\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|258,024\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1948\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|74.99\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|279,623\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|356,529\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1953\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|235.74\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|350,829\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|393,919\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1961\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|495.60\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|430,802\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|478,076\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1971\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|497.95\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|602,205\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|629,896\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1981\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|1,261.54\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|768,700\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|723,065\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1991\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|1,715.55\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|933,914\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|777,826\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|2001\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|641.36\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|779,145\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|779,145\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|2011\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|641.36\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|792,875\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|792,875\n|-\n|colspan=5 |<small>The data in column 3 refers to the population in the city borders as of the census in question.

Zagreb has four separate [[season]]s. Summers are generally warm, sometimes hot. In late May it gets significantly warmer, temperatures start rising and it is often pleasant with frequent afternoon and evening thunderstorms. Heatwaves can occur but are short-lived. Temperatures rise above {{convert|30|C}} on an average 14.6 days each summer. Rainfall is abundant in the summertime and it continues to be in autumn as well. With 840&nbsp;mm of precipitation per year, Zagreb is Europe's 9th wettest capital, receiving less precipitation than Luxembourg but more than [[Brussels]], [[Paris]] and [[London]]. [[Autumn]] in its early stages is often mild and sunny with occasional episodes of rain. Autumn is characterised by an increase in rainy days as well as by temperature averages that steadily fall towards the end of the season. Morning [[fog]] is common from mid-October to January, with northern city districts at the foothills of the [[Medvednica]] mountain as well as those districts along the [[Sava]] river being more prone to all-day fog accumulation. Winters are relatively cold with a precipitation decrease pattern. February is the driest month, averaging 39&nbsp;mm of precipitation. On average there are 29 days with snowfall, with first snow usually falling in early December. However, in recent years, the number of snowy days has decreased sharply. Springs are generally mild and pleasant with frequent weather changes and are windier than other seasons. Sometimes cold spells can occur, mostly in its early stages. The average daily mean temperature in the winter is around {{convert|1|\u00b0C}} (from December to February) and the average temperature in the summer is {{convert|22.0|C|1}}.<ref name= normals

The Sava and the [[Kupa (river)|Kupa]] valleys are to the south of Zagreb, and the region of [[Hrvatsko Zagorje]] is located on the other (northern) side of the Medvednica hill. In mid-January 2005, Sljeme held its first [[FIS Alpine World Ski Championships|World Ski Championship tournament]].\n\nFrom the summit, weather permitting, the vista reaches as far as [[Velebit]] Range along Croatia's rocky northern coast, as well as the snow-capped peaks of the towering [[Julian Alps]] in neighbouring [[Slovenia]]. There are several lodging villages, offering accommodation and restaurants for hikers. Skiers visit Sljeme, which has four ski-runs, three ski-lifts and a chairlift.\n\nThe old [[Medvedgrad]], a recently restored medieval [[wikt:Special:Search/burg|burg]] was built in the 13th century on Medvednica hill. It overlooks the western part of the city and also hosts the ''Shrine of the Homeland'', a memorial with an [[eternal flame]], where Croatia pays reverence to all its heroes fallen for [[homeland]] in its history, customarily on [[Public holiday|national holiday]]s. The ruined medieval fortress [[Susedgrad]] is located on far-western side of Medvednica hill. It has been abandoned since the early 17th century, but it is visited during the year.\n\nZagreb occasionally experiences earthquakes, due to the proximity of [[\u017dumberak]]-[[Medvednica]] fault zone.<ref>[http://www2.ogs.trieste.it/gngts/gngts/convegniprecedenti/2008/riassunti/1.1/11-toml.pdf SEISMOGENIC ZONES OF NORTHWESTERN CROATIA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206110700/http://www2.ogs.trieste.it/gngts/gngts/convegniprecedenti/2008/riassunti/1.1/11-toml.pdf |date=6 February 2016 }} GNGTS 2008</ref> It's classified as an area of high seismic activity.<ref name=\"embassy earthquake\">{{cite web|url=http://zagreb.usembassy.gov/service/special-consular-services/emergency-and-medical-issues/earthquake.html|title=Earthquake \u2013 Zagreb, Croatia \u2013 Embassy of the United States|work=usembassy.gov|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206090402/http://zagreb.usembassy.gov/service/special-consular-services/emergency-and-medical-issues/earthquake.html|archivedate=6 February 2016}}</ref> The area around Medvednica was the epicentre of the [[1880 Zagreb earthquake]] (magnitude 6.3), and the area is known for occasional landslide threatening houses in the area.<ref name=\"landslide survey croatian\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hgi-cgs.hr/zagreb_potresi.html|title=Potresi na zagreba\u010dkom podru\u010dju|last=dpuljic|work=hgi-cgs.hr}}</ref> The proximity of strong seismic sources presents a real danger of strong earthquakes.<ref name=\"landslide survey croatian\"/> Croatian Chief of [[Office of Emergency Management]] Pavle Kalini\u0107 stated Zagreb experiences around 400 earthquakes a year, most of them being imperceptible.

Since the end of the [[History of Croatia|war]], it has attracted close to a million visitors annually, mainly from [[Austria]], [[Germany]] and [[Italy]], and in recent years many tourists from far east (South Korea, Japan, China, and last two years, from India). It has become an important tourist destination, not only in Croatia, but considering the whole region of southeastern Europe. There are many interesting sights and happenings for tourists to attend in Zagreb, for example, the two statues of Saint George, one at the [[Republic of Croatia Square]], the other at [[Stone Gate|Kamenita vrata]], where the image of Virgin Mary is said to be only thing that hasn't burned in the 17th-century fire. Also, there is an art installation starting in Bogovi\u0107eva street, called [[Nine Views]]. Most people don't know what the statue \"Prizemljeno Sunce\" (The Grounded Sun) is for, and just scrawl graffiti or signatures on it, but it's actually the Sun scaled down, with many planets situated all over Zagreb in scale with the Sun. There are also many festivals and events throughout the year, which made Zagreb a year-round tourist destination for many years already.\n\nThe historical part of the city to the north of [[Ban Jela\u010di\u0107 Square]] is composed of the [[Gradec, Zagreb|Gornji Grad]] and [[Kaptol, Zagreb|Kaptol]], a medieval urban complex of churches, palaces, museums, galleries and government buildings that are popular with tourists on sightseeing tours. The historic district can be reached on foot, starting from [[Jela\u010di\u0107 Square]], the centre of Zagreb, or by a [[funicular]] on nearby Tomi\u0107eva Street. Each Saturday, (from April till the end of September), on [[St. Mark's Square, Zagreb|St. Mark's Square]] in the [[Gradec, Zagreb|Upper town]], tourists can meet members of the Order of The Silver Dragon (Red Srebrnog Zmaja), who reenact famous historical conflicts between [[Gradec, Zagreb County|Gradec]] and [[Kaptol, Zagreb|Kaptol]]. It's a great opportunity for all visitors to take photographs of authentic and fully functional historical replicas of medieval armour.\n\nIn 2010 more than 600,000<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poslovni.hr/vijesti/grad-zagreb-u-2010-broj-turistickih-dolazaka-veci-za-4-posto-168991.aspx |title=Broj turistickih dolazaka|publisher=poslovni.hr|accessdate=12 January 2012}}</ref> tourists visited the city, with a 10%<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kigo.hr/tekst/11098.html |title=Broj turista najvise porastao u Zagrebu |publisher=kigo.hr |accessdate=12 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130301124403/http://www.kigo.hr/tekst/11098.html |archivedate=1 March 2013}}</ref> increase seen in 2011.

The number of cars in the city centre is rising by 4% every year and current traffic levels require a widening of the road infrastructure. A particular problem is [[Ilica (street)|Ilica]] Street, which has high amounts of both car, tram and pedestrian traffic. Any widening of this street would take some space from the pedestrians. The tunnels would triple the downtown road capacity and allow the cars to travel at {{convert|50|km/h|abbr=on}} at [[peak hour]]. The seven tunnels would also help solve the problem of the unfinished [[Sljeme tunnel]], which has been a citywide nuisance for a long time.\n\nThe proposed tunnels would have an underground interchange near Jabukovac street in the hills north of the city centre. Three tunnels (one of which would have two tubes) would connect the future Jabukovac interchange with the city centre. Another tunnel would connect Jabukovac to [[Gup\u010deva zvijezda]], one would go to Zelengaj north of Britanski square and the third one would go to Von\u010dinina Street, about {{convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of Jabukovac. There would also be a tunnel connecting Dra\u0161kovi\u0107eva Street to [[Ribnjak, Zagreb]], eliminating the current long and often congested bypass which uses smaller streets near [[\u017drtava Fa\u0161izma Square]].\n\nShould the proposal be accepted, it would take three years to build the tunnels.<ref name=tuneli>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.sutra.hr/gradski-ritam/tunelima-kroz-centar-zagreba\n|title=Tunelima kroz centar Zagreba\n|accessdate=27 November 2007\n|last=\u0160imunovi\u0107\n|first=Damjan\n|date=24 November 2007\n|work=Sutra.hr\n|language=Croatian\n}}</ref>\n -->\n\n====Public transportation====\n[[File:Estaci\u00f3n Principal de FF.CC., Zagreb, Croacia, 2014-04-20, DD 03.JPG|thumb|right|[[Zagreb Glavni kolodvor|Main Railway Station]]]]\n[[File:Sede de los Ferrocarriles Croatas, Zagreb, Croacia, 2014-04-13, DD 01.JPG|thumb|right|[[Croatian Railways|Croatian Railways headquarters]]]]\n\n[[File:ZET tram&bus.jpg|thumb|right|[[Zagreba\u010dki elektri\u010dni tramvaj|ZET]] tram and city bus]]\n[[File:H\u017d Class 6112 1.JPG|thumb|right|[[H\u017d series 6112|Newest model]] of the Zagreb city trains system]]\n[[Public transport]]ation in the city is organised in several layers: the inner parts of the city are mostly covered by [[tram]]s, the outer city areas and closer suburbs are linked with [[bus]]es and rapid transit [[Zagreb Commuter Rail|commuter rail]].\n\nThe public transportation company [[Zagreba\u010dki elektri\u010dni tramvaj|ZET]] (''Zagreba\u010dki elektri\u010dni tramvaj'', Zagreb Electric Tram) operates trams, all inner bus lines, and the most of the suburban bus lines, and it is subsidised by the city council.\n\nThe national rail operator [[Croatian Railways]] (''Hrvatske \u017eeljeznice'', H\u017d) runs a network of urban and suburban train lines in the metropolitan Zagreb area, and is a [[government-owned corporation]].\n\nThe [[funicular]] (''uspinja\u010da'') in the historic part of the city is a [[tourist attraction]].\n\n[[Taxicab|Taxi]] market has been liberalized in early 2018<ref>{{cite web|url=https://vlada.gov.hr/vijesti/ministar-butkovic-novim-zakonom-o-prijevozu-u-cestovnom-prometu-jeftiniji-i-dostupniji-taksi-za-sve-gradjane/23630 |title=Ministar Butkovi\u0107: Novim Zakonom o prijevozu u cestovnom prometu jeftiniji i dostupniji taksi za sve gra\u0111ane |publisher=Government of the Republic of Croatia }}</ref> and numerous transport companies have been allowed to enter the market; consequently, the prices significantly dropped whereas the service was immensely improved so the popularity of taxis in Zagreb has been increasing from then onwards.\n\n=====Tram network=====\n{{main|Trams in Zagreb}}\nZagreb has an extensive [[tram]] network with 15-day and 4 night lines covering much of the inner- and middle-suburbs of the city.
