Thames and Hudson, NY.</ref> An associated discipline, and again one that lies within archaeology itself, is [[underwater archaeology]], which studies the past through any submerged remains be they of maritime interest or not. An example from the prehistoric era would be  the remains of submerged settlements or deposits now lying under water despite having been dry land when sea levels were lower. The study of submerged aircraft lost in lakes, rivers or in the sea is an example from the historical, industrial or modern era. Many specialist sub-disciplines within the broader maritime and  underwater archaeological categories have emerged in recent years.<ref>Delgado, J. P., (ed.). 1997.  British Museum Encyclopaedia of Underwater and Maritime Archaeology, British Museum Press, London</ref>\n\nMaritime archaeological sites often result from [[shipwreck]]s or sometimes [[seismic activity]], and thus represent a moment in time rather than a slow deposition of material accumulated over a period of years, as is the case with port-related structures (such as [[pier]]s, [[wharves]], [[dock (maritime)|docks]] and [[jetties]]) where objects  are lost or thrown off structures over extended periods of time.<ref>Withgott, Jay, Scott Brennan, J. 2007. Environment: the science behind the stories. 2nd ed. Pearson Benjamin Cummings, San Francisco.</ref> This fact has led to shipwrecks often being described  in the media and in popular accounts as '[[time capsules]]'.\n\nArchaeological material in the sea or in other underwater environments is typically subject to different factors than [[artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] on land. However, as with terrestrial archaeology, what survives to be investigated by modern archaeologists can often be a tiny fraction of the material originally deposited. A feature of maritime archaeology is that despite all the material that is lost, there are occasional rare examples of substantial survival, from which a great deal can be learned, due to the difficulties often experienced in accessing the sites.\n\nThere are those in the archaeology community who see maritime archaeology as a separate discipline with its own concerns (such as shipwrecks) and requiring the specialized skills of the [[underwater archaeology|underwater archaeologist]].  Others value an integrated approach, stressing that nautical activity has economic and social links to communities on land and that archaeology is archaeology no matter  where the study is conducted. All that is required is the mastering of skills specific to the environment in which the work occurs.\n\n[[File:Lakemurray-wyse ferry Bridge sonar.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Submerged bridge under [[Lake Murray (South Carolina)|Lake Murray, South Carolina]] in 160 ft (49 m) of fresh water seen on [[side-scan sonar]] imagery using a Humminbird 981c Side Imaging system]]\n\n==Integrating land and sea==\nBefore the industrial era, travel by water was often easier than over land. As a result, marine channels, navigable rivers and sea crossings formed the trade routes of historic and ancient civilisations. For example, the [[Maritime archaeology#Mediterranean area|Mediterranean Sea]] was known to the Romans as the inner sea because the [[Roman empire]] spread around its coasts. The historic record as well as the remains of harbours, ships and cargoes, testify to the volume of trade that crossed it.  Later, nations with a strong maritime culture such as the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Denmark]],  [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]] were able to establish colonies on other continents. Wars were fought at sea over the control of important resources. The material cultural remains that are discovered by maritime archaeologists along former trade routes can be combined with historical documents and material cultural remains found on land to understand the economic, social and political environment of the past. Of late maritime archaeologists have been examining the submerged  cultural remains  of   [[China]],  [[India]],  [[Korea]] and other Asian nations.\n\n==Preservation of material underwater==\n[[File:MaryRose-salvage1982-above water edited.jpg|right|thumb|The final phases of the salvage of {{ship||Mary Rose}} on October 11, 1982.]]\nThere are significant differences in the survival of archaeological material depending on whether a site is wet or dry, on the nature of the chemical environment, on the presence of biological organisms and on the dynamic forces present.  Thus rocky coastlines, especially in shallow water, are typically inimical to the survival of artifacts, which can be dispersed, smashed or ground by the effect of currents and surf, possibly (but not always) leaving an artifact pattern but little if any wreck structure.\n\nSaltwater is particularly inimical to iron artefacts including metal shipwrecks, and sea organisms will readily consume organic material such as wooden shipwrecks.  On the other hand, out of all the thousands of potential archaeological sites destroyed or grossly eroded by such natural processes, occasionally sites survive with exceptional preservation of a related collection of artifacts. An example of such a collection is {{ship||Mary Rose}}.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/documentaries/2008/08/080821_what_lies_beneath.shtml BBC Radio World Service Broadcast, \"What Lies Beneath,\" first broadcast Friday 22 August 2008]</ref> Survival in this instance is largely due to the remains being buried in sediment\n\nOf the many examples where the sea bed provides an extremely hostile environment for submerged evidence of history, one of the most notable, {{RMS|Titanic}}, though a relatively young wreck and in deep water so calcium-starved that [[concretion]]  does not occur, appears strong and relatively intact, though indications are that it has already incurred irreversible degradation of her steel and iron hull. As such degradation inevitably continues, data will be forever lost, objects' context will be destroyed and the bulk of the wreck will over centuries  completely deteriorate on the floor of the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Comparative evidence shows that all iron and steel ships, especially those in a highly oxygenated  environment,  continue to degrade and will continue to do so until only their  engines and other machinery project much  above the sea-floor.<ref>McCarthy, M., 2000, Iron and steamship archaeology : success and failure of the SS Xantho. New York : Kluwer Academic/Plenum. {{ISBN|0-306-46365-2}}</ref>  Where it remains even after the passage of time,  the iron or steel hull is often fragile with no remaining metal within the layer of concretion and corrosion products. {{USS|Monitor}}, having been found in the 1970s, was subjected to a program of attempted ''in situ'' preservation, for example, but deterioration of the vessel progressed at such a rate that the rescue of her turret was undertaken lest nothing be saved from the wreck.\n\nSome wrecks, lost to natural obstacles to navigation, are at risk of being smashed by subsequent wrecks sunk by the same hazard, or are deliberately destroyed because they present a hazard to navigation. Even in deep water, commercial activities such as pipe-laying operations and deep sea trawling can place a wreck at risk.  Such a wreck is the ''Mardi Gras'' [[shipwreck]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Mystery Mardi Gras Shipwreck|url=http://nautilusproductions.com/projects/mystery-mardi-gras-shipwreck-documentary|website=Nautilus Productions}}</ref> sunk in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] in {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} of water. The shipwreck lay forgotten at the bottom of the sea until it was discovered in 2002 by an oilfield inspection crew working for the Okeanos Gas Gathering Company (OGGC).<ref>{{cite web|title=Mardi Gras Shipwreck |url=http://uwf.edu/jkent/fpan_preCMS/mardigras/ |website=uwf.edu |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150516045935/http://uwf.edu/jkent/fpan_preCMS/mardigras/ |archive-date=2015-05-16 |df= }}</ref> Large pipelines can crush sites and render some of their remnants inaccessible as pipe is dropped from the ocean surface to the substrate thousands of feet below. Trawl nets snag and tear superstructures and separate artifacts from their context.\n\n[[File:The Vasa from the Bow.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The bow of {{ship||Vasa|ship|2}}, a Swedish warship that foundered and sank on its maiden voyage in 1628. It was salvaged in 1961 and is now on permanent display at the [[Vasa Museum]] in Stockholm.]]\nThe wrecks, and other archaeological sites that have been preserved have generally survived because the dynamic nature of the sea bed can result in artifacts becoming rapidly buried in sediments. These sediments then provide an anaerobic environment which protects from further degradation. Wet environments, whether on land in the form of peat bogs and wells, or underwater are particularly important for the survival of organic material, such as wood, leather, fabric and horn. Cold and absence of light also aid survival of artifacts, because there is little energy available for either organic activity or chemical reactions. Salt water provides for greater organic activity than freshwater, and in particular, the [[shipworm]], terredo navalis, lives only in salt water, so some of the best preservation in the absence of sediments has been found in the cold, dark waters of the [[Great Lakes]] in North America and in the (low salinity) [[Baltic Sea]] (where ''Vasa'' was preserved).\n\nWhile the land surface is continuously reused by societies, the sea bed was largely inaccessible until the advent of [[submarine]]s, [[scuba equipment]] and [[remotely operated underwater vehicle]]s (ROVs) in the twentieth century. [[Marine salvage|Salvagers]] have operated in much earlier times, but much of the material was beyond the reach of anyone. Thus ''Mary Rose'' was subject to salvage from the sixteenth century and later, but a very large amount of material, buried in the sediments, remained to be found by maritime archaeologists of the twentieth century.\n\nWhile preservation in situ is not assured, material that has survived underwater and is then recovered to land is typically in an unstable state and can only be preserved using highly specialised conservation processes.  While the wooden structure of ''Mary Rose'' and the individual artifacts have been undergoing conservation since their recovery, {{HMS|Holland 1||2}} provides an example of a relatively recent (metal) wreck for which extensive conservation has been necessary to preserve the hull. While the hull remains intact, its  machinery remains inoperable. The engine of {{SS|Xantho}} that was recovered in 1985 from a saline environment after over a century underwater is presently considered somewhat anomalous, in that after two decades of treatment it can now be turned over by hand.\n\nA challenge for the modern archaeologist is to consider whether  ''in-situ'' preservation, or recovery and conservation on land is the preferable option; or to face the fact that preservation in any form, other than as an archaeological record is not feasible. A site that has been discovered has typically been subjected to disturbance of the very factors that caused its survival in the first place, for example, when a covering of sediment has been removed by storms or the action of man. Active monitoring and deliberate protection may mitigate  further rapid destruction making ''in situ'' preservation an option, but long-term survival can never be guaranteed. For very many sites, the costs are too great for either active measures to ensure ''in situ'' preservation or to provide for satisfactory conservation on recovery. Even the cost of proper and complete archaeological investigation may be too great to enable this to occur within a timescale that ensures that an archaeological record is made before data is inevitably lost.\n\n==Submerged sites==\n\n===Pre-historic landscapes===\nMaritime archaeology studies [[prehistoric]]al objects and sites that are, because of changes in [[climate]] and [[geology]], now underwater.\n\nBodies of water, fresh and saline, have been important sources of food for people for as long as we have existed. It should be no surprise that ancient villages were located at the water's edge.  Since the [[Quaternary glaciation|last ice age]] sea level has risen as much as {{convert|400|ft|m}}.\n\nTherefore, a great deal of the record of human activity throughout the Ice Age is now to be found under water.\n\nThe flooding of the area now known as the [[Black Sea]] (when a land bridge, where  the [[Bosporus]] is now, collapsed under the pressure of rising water in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]) submerged a great deal of human activity that had been gathered round what had been an enormous, fresh-water lake.\n\nSignificant [[cave art]] sites off the coast of western Europe such as the  Grotto Cosquer can be reached only by diving, because the cave entrances are underwater, though the upper portions of  the [[caves]] themselves are not flooded.\n\n===Historic sites===\nThroughout history, [[seismic]] events have at times caused submergence of human settlements.  The remains of such catastrophes exist all over the world, and sites such as [[Alexandria]] and [[Port Royal]] now form important archaeological sites. As with shipwrecks, archaeological research can follow multiple themes, including evidence of the final catastrophe, the structures and landscape before the catastrophe and the culture and economy of which it formed a part. Unlike the wrecking of a ship, the destruction of a town by a seismic event can take place over many years and there may be evidence for several phases of damage, sometimes with rebuilding in between.\n\n==Coastal and foreshore==\n\nNot all maritime sites are underwater.  There are many structures at the margin of land and water that provide evidence of the human societies of the past. Some are deliberately created for access - such as bridges and walkways. Other structures remain from exploitation of resources, such as dams and fish traps. Nautical remains include early harbours and places where ships were built or repaired. At the end of their life, ships were often beached.  Valuable or easily accessed timber has often been salvaged  leaving just a few frames and bottom planking.\n\nArchaeological sites can also be found on the foreshore today that would have been on dry land when they were constructed. An example of such a site is [[Seahenge]], a Bronze Age timber circle.\n\n==Ships and shipwrecks==\n[[File:Allveelaeva \"Akula\" vrakk.JPG|thumb|Wreck of [[Russian submarine Akula (1907)|Russian submarine ''Akula'']] was found in 2014 near [[Hiiumaa]], [[Estonia]].]]\n{{main|Archaeology of shipwrecks}}\nThe archaeology of shipwrecks  can be divided into a three-tier hierarchy, of which the first tier considers the wrecking process itself: how does a [[ship]] break up, how does a ship sink to the bottom, and how do the remains of the ship, cargo and the surrounding environment evolve over time? The second tier studies the ship as a machine, both in itself and in a military or economic system. The third tier consists of the archaeology of maritime cultures, in which nautical technology, [[naval warfare]], trade and shipboard societies are studied. Some consider this to be the most important  tier.  Ships and boats are not necessarily wrecked: some are deliberately abandoned, scuttled or beached.  Many such abandoned vessels have been extensively salvaged.\n\n===Bronze Age===\nThe earliest boats discovered date from the [[Bronze Age]] and are constructed of hollowed out logs or sewn planks. Vessels have been discovered where they have been preserved in sediments underwater or in waterlogged land sites, such as the [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_west/5282874.stm discovery of a canoe near St Botolphs.] Examples of sewn-plank boats include those found at [[Ferriby Boats|North Ferriby]] and the [http://www.archaeology.co.uk/ca/timeline/prehistory/dover/dover.htm Dover Bronze Age Boat] which is now displayed at [[Dover Museum]][https://web.archive.org/web/20060628183843/http://www.dover.gov.uk/museum/boat/]. These may be an evolution from boats made of sewn hides, but it is highly unlikely that hide boats could have survived.\n\nShips wrecked in the sea have probably not survived, although remains of cargo (particularly bronze material) have been discovered, such as those at the [[Salcombe Cannon Wreck|Salcombe B site]]. A close collection of artefacts on the sea bed may imply that artefacts were from a ship, even if there are no remains of the actual vessel.\n\nLate Bronze Age ships, such as the [[Uluburun Shipwreck]] have been discovered in the Mediterranean, constructed of edge joined planks. This shipbuilding technology continued through the classical period.\n\n==Maritime archaeology by region==\n===Mediterranean area===<!-- This section is linked from [[Maritime archaeology]] -->\n\nIn the [[Mediterranean]] area, maritime archaeologists have investigated several ancient cultures. Notable early [[Iron Age]] shipwrecks include two [[Phoenicia]]n ships of c. 750 BC that foundered off Gaza with cargoes of wine in [[amphora]]s.  The crew of the U.S. Navy deep submergence research submarine [[NR-1]] discovered the sites in 1997. In 1999 a team led by [[Robert Ballard]] and Harvard University archaeology Professor [[Lawrence Stager]] investigated the wrecks.\n\nExtensive research has been carried out on the Mediterranean and Aegean coastlines of Turkey. Complete excavations have been performed on several wrecks from the [[classical antiquity|Classical]], [[Hellenistic]], [[Byzantine]], and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] periods.\n\nMaritime archaeological studies in Italy illuminate the naval and maritime activities of the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]], Greek colonists, and [[ancient Rome|Romans]]. After the 2nd century BC, the Roman fleet ruled the Mediterranean and actively suppressed piracy. During this [[Pax Romana]], seaborne trade increased significantly throughout the region. Though sailing was the safest, fastest, and most efficient method of transportation in the ancient world, some fractional percentage of voyages ended in shipwreck. With the significantly increased sea traffic during the Roman era came a corresponding increase in shipwrecks. These wrecks and their cargo remains offer glimpses through time of the economy, culture, and politics of the ancient world. Particularly useful to archaeologists are studies of [[amphora]]s, the ceramic shipping containers used in the Mediterranean region from the 15th century BC through the Medieval period.\n\nIn addition to many discoveries in the sea, some wrecks have been examined in lakes. Most notable are [[Caligula]]'s pleasure barges in Lake [[Nemi]], [[Italy]]. The [[Nemi ships]] and other shipwreck sites occasionally yield objects of unique artistic value. For instance, the [[Antikythera wreck]] contained a staggering collection of marble and bronze statues including the Antikythera Youth. Discovered in 1900 by Greek sponge divers, the ship probably sank in the 1st century BC and may have been dispatched by the Roman general, Sulla, to carry booty back to Rome. The sponge divers also recovered from the wreck the famous [[Antikythera mechanism]], believed to be an astronomical calculator. Further examples of fabulous works of art recovered from the sea floor are the two \"bronzi\" found in [[Riace]] ([[Calabria]]), Italy. In the cases of Antikythera and Riace, however, the artifacts were recovered without the direct participation of maritime archaeologists.\n\nRecent studies in the [[Sarno]] river (near [[Pompeii]]) show other interesting elements of ancient life. The Sarno projects suggests that on the Tyrrhenian shore there were little towns with [[palafitte]]s, similar to ancient [[Venice]]. In the same area, the submerged town of Puteoli ([[Pozzuoli]], close to [[Naples]]) contains the \"portus Julius\" created by [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]] in 37 BC, later sunk due to [[bradyseism]].\n\nThe sea floor elsewhere in the Mediterranean holds countless archaeological sites. In [[Israel]], [[Herod the Great]]'s port at [[Caesarea Maritima]] has been extensively studied. Other finds are consistent with some passages of the [[Bible]] (like the so-called [[Sea of Galilee Boat|Jesus boat]], which appears to have been in use during the first century AD).\n\n===Australia===\nMaritime archaeology in Australia commenced in the 1970s with the advent of Jeremy Green due to concerns expressed by academics and politicians with the rampant destruction of the Dutch and British East India ships lost on the west coast. As Commonwealth legislation was enacted  and enforced after 1976 and as States enacted their own legislation the sub-discipline spread throughout Australia concentrating initially  on shipwrecks due to on-going funding by both the States and the Commonwealth under their shipwreck legislation.<ref>Nash, M., (ed), 2007 Shipwreck Archaeology in Australia.  University of Western Australia Press.</ref> Studies now include as an element of underwater archaeology, as a whole, the study of submerged indigenous sites. Nautical Archaeology, (the specialised study of boat and ship construction)  is also practised in the region. Often the sites or relics  studied in Australia as in the rest of the world  are not inundated.  The study of  historic  submerged aircraft, better known as a sub-discipline of [[aviation archaeology]], [[underwater aviation archaeology]] is  also practised in the region. In some  states  maritime  and underwater archaeology is practised  out of Museums and in others out of cultural heritage management units and all practitioners operate under  the aegis of the Australasian Institute for Maritime Archaeology (AIMA).<ref>Staniforth, M., & Nash, M., (eds.)

British Museum Encyclopaedia of Underwater and Maritime Archaeology, British Museum Press, London</ref>\n\nMaritime archaeological sites often result from [[shipwreck]]s or sometimes [[seismic activity]], and thus represent a moment in time rather than a slow deposition of material accumulated over a period of years, as is the case with port-related structures (such as [[pier]]s, [[wharves]], [[dock (maritime)|docks]] and [[jetties]]) where objects  are lost or thrown off structures over extended periods of time.<ref>Withgott, Jay, Scott Brennan, J. 2007.

However, as with terrestrial archaeology, what survives to be investigated by modern archaeologists can often be a tiny fraction of the material originally deposited. A feature of maritime archaeology is that despite all the material that is lost, there are occasional rare examples of substantial survival, from which a great deal can be learned, due to the difficulties often experienced in accessing the sites.\n\nThere are those in the archaeology community who see maritime archaeology as a separate discipline with its own concerns (such as shipwrecks) and requiring the specialized skills of the [[underwater archaeology|underwater archaeologist]].

As a result, marine channels, navigable rivers and sea crossings formed the trade routes of historic and ancient civilisations. For example, the [[Maritime archaeology#Mediterranean area|Mediterranean Sea]] was known to the Romans as the inner sea because the [[Roman empire]] spread around its coasts. The historic record as well as the remains of harbours, ships and cargoes, testify to the volume of trade that crossed it.  Later, nations with a strong maritime culture such as the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Denmark]],  [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]] were able to establish colonies on other continents. Wars were fought at sea over the control of important resources. The material cultural remains that are discovered by maritime archaeologists along former trade routes can be combined with historical documents and material cultural remains found on land to understand the economic, social and political environment of the past. Of late maritime archaeologists have been examining the submerged  cultural remains  of   [[China]],  [[India]],  [[Korea]] and other Asian nations.\n\n==Preservation of material underwater==\n[[File:MaryRose-salvage1982-above water edited.jpg|right|thumb|The final phases of the salvage of {{ship||Mary Rose}} on October 11, 1982.]]\nThere are significant differences in the survival of archaeological material depending on whether a site is wet or dry, on the nature of the chemical environment, on the presence of biological organisms and on the dynamic forces present.  Thus rocky coastlines, especially in shallow water, are typically inimical to the survival of artifacts, which can be dispersed, smashed or ground by the effect of currents and surf, possibly (but not always) leaving an artifact pattern but little if any wreck structure.\n\nSaltwater is particularly inimical to iron artefacts including metal shipwrecks, and sea organisms will readily consume organic material such as wooden shipwrecks.  On the other hand, out of all the thousands of potential archaeological sites destroyed or grossly eroded by such natural processes, occasionally sites survive with exceptional preservation of a related collection of artifacts. An example of such a collection is {{ship||Mary Rose}}.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/documentaries/2008/08/080821_what_lies_beneath.shtml BBC Radio World Service Broadcast, \"What Lies Beneath,\" first broadcast Friday 22 August 2008]</ref> Survival in this instance is largely due to the remains being buried in sediment\n\nOf the many examples where the sea bed provides an extremely hostile environment for submerged evidence of history, one of the most notable, {{RMS|Titanic}}, though a relatively young wreck and in deep water so calcium-starved that [[concretion]]  does not occur, appears strong and relatively intact, though indications are that it has already incurred irreversible degradation of her steel and iron hull. As such degradation inevitably continues, data will be forever lost, objects' context will be destroyed and the bulk of the wreck will over centuries  completely deteriorate on the floor of the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Comparative evidence shows that all iron and steel ships, especially those in a highly oxygenated  environment,  continue to degrade and will continue to do so until only their  engines and other machinery project much  above the sea-floor.<ref>McCarthy, M., 2000, Iron and steamship archaeology : success and failure of the SS Xantho. New York : Kluwer Academic/Plenum. {{ISBN|0-306-46365-2}}</ref>  Where it remains even after the passage of time,  the iron or steel hull is often fragile with no remaining metal within the layer of concretion and corrosion products. {{USS|Monitor}}, having been found in the 1970s, was subjected to a program of attempted ''in situ'' preservation, for example, but deterioration of the vessel progressed at such a rate that the rescue of her turret was undertaken lest nothing be saved from the wreck.\n\nSome wrecks, lost to natural obstacles to navigation, are at risk of being smashed by subsequent wrecks sunk by the same hazard, or are deliberately destroyed because they present a hazard to navigation. Even in deep water, commercial activities such as pipe-laying operations and deep sea trawling can place a wreck at risk.  Such a wreck is the ''Mardi Gras'' [[shipwreck]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Mystery Mardi Gras Shipwreck|url=http://nautilusproductions.com/projects/mystery-mardi-gras-shipwreck-documentary|website=Nautilus Productions}}</ref> sunk in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] in {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} of water. The shipwreck lay forgotten at the bottom of the sea until it was discovered in 2002 by an oilfield inspection crew working for the Okeanos Gas Gathering Company (OGGC).<ref>{{cite web|title=Mardi Gras Shipwreck |url=http://uwf.edu/jkent/fpan_preCMS/mardigras/ |website=uwf.edu |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150516045935/http://uwf.edu/jkent/fpan_preCMS/mardigras/ |archive-date=2015-05-16 |df= }}</ref> Large pipelines can crush sites and render some of their remnants inaccessible as pipe is dropped from the ocean surface to the substrate thousands of feet below. Trawl nets snag and tear superstructures and separate artifacts from their context.\n\n[[File:The Vasa from the Bow.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The bow of {{ship||Vasa|ship|2}}, a Swedish warship that foundered and sank on its maiden voyage in 1628. It was salvaged in 1961 and is now on permanent display at the [[Vasa Museum]] in Stockholm.]]\nThe wrecks, and other archaeological sites that have been preserved have generally survived because the dynamic nature of the sea bed can result in artifacts becoming rapidly buried in sediments. These sediments then provide an anaerobic environment which protects from further degradation. Wet environments, whether on land in the form of peat bogs and wells, or underwater are particularly important for the survival of organic material, such as wood, leather, fabric and horn. Cold and absence of light also aid survival of artifacts, because there is little energy available for either organic activity or chemical reactions. Salt water provides for greater organic activity than freshwater, and in particular, the [[shipworm]], terredo navalis, lives only in salt water, so some of the best preservation in the absence of sediments has been found in the cold, dark waters of the [[Great Lakes]] in North America and in the (low salinity) [[Baltic Sea]] (where ''Vasa'' was preserved).\n\nWhile the land surface is continuously reused by societies, the sea bed was largely inaccessible until the advent of [[submarine]]s, [[scuba equipment]] and [[remotely operated underwater vehicle]]s (ROVs) in the twentieth century. [[Marine salvage|Salvagers]] have operated in much earlier times, but much of the material was beyond the reach of anyone. Thus ''Mary Rose'' was subject to salvage from the sixteenth century and later, but a very large amount of material, buried in the sediments, remained to be found by maritime archaeologists of the twentieth century.\n\nWhile preservation in situ is not assured, material that has survived underwater and is then recovered to land is typically in an unstable state and can only be preserved using highly specialised conservation processes.  While the wooden structure of ''Mary Rose'' and the individual artifacts have been undergoing conservation since their recovery, {{HMS|Holland 1||2}} provides an example of a relatively recent (metal) wreck for which extensive conservation has been necessary to preserve the hull. While the hull remains intact, its  machinery remains inoperable. The engine of {{SS|Xantho}} that was recovered in 1985 from a saline environment after over a century underwater is presently considered somewhat anomalous, in that after two decades of treatment it can now be turned over by hand.\n\nA challenge for the modern archaeologist is to consider whether  ''in-situ'' preservation, or recovery and conservation on land is the preferable option; or to face the fact that preservation in any form, other than as an archaeological record is not feasible. A site that has been discovered has typically been subjected to disturbance of the very factors that caused its survival in the first place, for example, when a covering of sediment has been removed by storms or the action of man. Active monitoring and deliberate protection may mitigate  further rapid destruction making ''in situ'' preservation an option, but long-term survival can never be guaranteed. For very many sites, the costs are too great for either active measures to ensure ''in situ'' preservation or to provide for satisfactory conservation on recovery. Even the cost of proper and complete archaeological investigation may be too great to enable this to occur within a timescale that ensures that an archaeological record is made before data is inevitably lost.\n\n==Submerged sites==\n\n===Pre-historic landscapes===\nMaritime archaeology studies [[prehistoric]]al objects and sites that are, because of changes in [[climate]] and [[geology]], now underwater.\n\nBodies of water, fresh and saline, have been important sources of food for people for as long as we have existed. It should be no surprise that ancient villages were located at the water's edge.  Since the [[Quaternary glaciation|last ice age]] sea level has risen as much as {{convert|400|ft|m}}.\n\nTherefore, a great deal of the record of human activity throughout the Ice Age is now to be found under water.\n\nThe flooding of the area now known as the [[Black Sea]] (when a land bridge, where  the [[Bosporus]] is now, collapsed under the pressure of rising water in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]) submerged a great deal of human activity that had been gathered round what had been an enormous, fresh-water lake.\n\nSignificant [[cave art]] sites off the coast of western Europe such as the  Grotto Cosquer can be reached only by diving, because the cave entrances are underwater, though the upper portions of  the [[caves]] themselves are not flooded.\n\n===Historic sites===\nThroughout history, [[seismic]] events have at times caused submergence of human settlements.  The remains of such catastrophes exist all over the world, and sites such as [[Alexandria]] and [[Port Royal]] now form important archaeological sites. As with shipwrecks, archaeological research can follow multiple themes, including evidence of the final catastrophe, the structures and landscape before the catastrophe and the culture and economy of which it formed a part. Unlike the wrecking of a ship, the destruction of a town by a seismic event can take place over many years and there may be evidence for several phases of damage, sometimes with rebuilding in between.\n\n==Coastal and foreshore==\n\nNot all maritime sites are underwater.  There are many structures at the margin of land and water that provide evidence of the human societies of the past. Some are deliberately created for access - such as bridges and walkways. Other structures remain from exploitation of resources, such as dams and fish traps. Nautical remains include early harbours and places where ships were built or repaired. At the end of their life, ships were often beached.  Valuable or easily accessed timber has often been salvaged  leaving just a few frames and bottom planking.\n\nArchaeological sites can also be found on the foreshore today that would have been on dry land when they were constructed. An example of such a site is [[Seahenge]], a Bronze Age timber circle.\n\n==Ships and shipwrecks==\n[[File:Allveelaeva \"Akula\" vrakk.JPG|thumb|Wreck of [[Russian submarine Akula (1907)|Russian submarine ''Akula'']] was found in 2014 near [[Hiiumaa]], [[Estonia]].]]\n{{main|Archaeology of shipwrecks}}\nThe archaeology of shipwrecks  can be divided into a three-tier hierarchy, of which the first tier considers the wrecking process itself: how does a [[ship]] break up, how does a ship sink to the bottom, and how do the remains of the ship, cargo and the surrounding environment evolve over time? The second tier studies the ship as a machine, both in itself and in a military or economic system. The third tier consists of the archaeology of maritime cultures, in which nautical technology, [[naval warfare]], trade and shipboard societies are studied. Some consider this to be the most important  tier.  Ships and boats are not necessarily wrecked: some are deliberately abandoned, scuttled or beached.  Many such abandoned vessels have been extensively salvaged.\n\n===Bronze Age===\nThe earliest boats discovered date from the [[Bronze Age]] and are constructed of hollowed out logs or sewn planks. Vessels have been discovered where they have been preserved in sediments underwater or in waterlogged land sites, such as the [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_west/5282874.stm discovery of a canoe near St Botolphs.] Examples of sewn-plank boats include those found at [[Ferriby Boats|North Ferriby]] and the [http://www.archaeology.co.uk/ca/timeline/prehistory/dover/dover.htm Dover Bronze Age Boat] which is now displayed at [[Dover Museum]][https://web.archive.org/web/20060628183843/http://www.dover.gov.uk/museum/boat/]. These may be an evolution from boats made of sewn hides, but it is highly unlikely that hide boats could have survived.\n\nShips wrecked in the sea have probably not survived, although remains of cargo (particularly bronze material) have been discovered, such as those at the [[Salcombe Cannon Wreck|Salcombe B site]]. A close collection of artefacts on the sea bed may imply that artefacts were from a ship, even if there are no remains of the actual vessel.\n\nLate Bronze Age ships, such as the [[Uluburun Shipwreck]] have been discovered in the Mediterranean, constructed of edge joined planks. This shipbuilding technology continued through the classical period.\n\n==Maritime archaeology by region==\n===Mediterranean area===<!-- This section is linked from [[Maritime archaeology]] -->\n\nIn the [[Mediterranean]] area, maritime archaeologists have investigated several ancient cultures. Notable early [[Iron Age]] shipwrecks include two [[Phoenicia]]n ships of c. 750 BC that foundered off Gaza with cargoes of wine in [[amphora]]s.  The crew of the U.S. Navy deep submergence research submarine [[NR-1]] discovered the sites in 1997. In 1999 a team led by [[Robert Ballard]] and Harvard University archaeology Professor [[Lawrence Stager]] investigated the wrecks.\n\nExtensive research has been carried out on the Mediterranean and Aegean coastlines of Turkey. Complete excavations have been performed on several wrecks from the [[classical antiquity|Classical]], [[Hellenistic]], [[Byzantine]], and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] periods.\n\nMaritime archaeological studies in Italy illuminate the naval and maritime activities of the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]], Greek colonists, and [[ancient Rome|Romans]]. After the 2nd century BC, the Roman fleet ruled the Mediterranean and actively suppressed piracy. During this [[Pax Romana]], seaborne trade increased significantly throughout the region. Though sailing was the safest, fastest, and most efficient method of transportation in the ancient world, some fractional percentage of voyages ended in shipwreck. With the significantly increased sea traffic during the Roman era came a corresponding increase in shipwrecks. These wrecks and their cargo remains offer glimpses through time of the economy, culture, and politics of the ancient world. Particularly useful to archaeologists are studies of [[amphora]]s, the ceramic shipping containers used in the Mediterranean region from the 15th century BC through the Medieval period.\n\nIn addition to many discoveries in the sea, some wrecks have been examined in lakes. Most notable are [[Caligula]]'s pleasure barges in Lake [[Nemi]], [[Italy]]. The [[Nemi ships]] and other shipwreck sites occasionally yield objects of unique artistic value. For instance, the [[Antikythera wreck]] contained a staggering collection of marble and bronze statues including the Antikythera Youth. Discovered in 1900 by Greek sponge divers, the ship probably sank in the 1st century BC and may have been dispatched by the Roman general, Sulla, to carry booty back to Rome. The sponge divers also recovered from the wreck the famous [[Antikythera mechanism]], believed to be an astronomical calculator. Further examples of fabulous works of art recovered from the sea floor are the two \"bronzi\" found in [[Riace]] ([[Calabria]]), Italy. In the cases of Antikythera and Riace, however, the artifacts were recovered without the direct participation of maritime archaeologists.\n\nRecent studies in the [[Sarno]] river (near [[Pompeii]]) show other interesting elements of ancient life. The Sarno projects suggests that on the Tyrrhenian shore there were little towns with [[palafitte]]s, similar to ancient [[Venice]]. In the same area, the submerged town of Puteoli ([[Pozzuoli]], close to [[Naples]]) contains the \"portus Julius\" created by [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]] in 37 BC, later sunk due to [[bradyseism]].\n\nThe sea floor elsewhere in the Mediterranean holds countless archaeological sites. In [[Israel]], [[Herod the Great]]'s port at [[Caesarea Maritima]] has been extensively studied. Other finds are consistent with some passages of the [[Bible]] (like the so-called [[Sea of Galilee Boat|Jesus boat]], which appears to have been in use during the first century AD).\n\n===Australia===\nMaritime archaeology in Australia commenced in the 1970s with the advent of Jeremy Green due to concerns expressed by academics and politicians with the rampant destruction of the Dutch and British East India ships lost on the west coast. As Commonwealth legislation was enacted  and enforced after 1976 and as States enacted their own legislation the sub-discipline spread throughout Australia concentrating initially  on shipwrecks due to on-going funding by both the States and the Commonwealth under their shipwreck legislation.<ref>Nash, M., (ed), 2007 Shipwreck Archaeology in Australia.  University of Western Australia Press.</ref> Studies now include as an element of underwater archaeology, as a whole, the study of submerged indigenous sites. Nautical Archaeology, (the specialised study of boat and ship construction)  is also practised in the region. Often the sites or relics  studied in Australia as in the rest of the world  are not inundated.  The study of  historic  submerged aircraft, better known as a sub-discipline of [[aviation archaeology]], [[underwater aviation archaeology]] is  also practised in the region. In some  states  maritime  and underwater archaeology is practised  out of Museums and in others out of cultural heritage management units and all practitioners operate under  the aegis of the Australasian Institute for Maritime Archaeology (AIMA).<ref>Staniforth, M., & Nash, M., (eds.)

[[Mary Kay Place]], [[Meadow Sisto]], and [[Benjamin Salisbury]] also star as his wife and children.\n\n==Plot==\nMartin Harvey is a middle-aged office worker who lives in  [[Chicago]] with his wife, Katherine, 16-year-old daughter, Caroline, and 11-year-old son, Ben. When he learns his recently deceased uncle has bequeathed him a 60' yacht once owned by [[Clark Gable]], he decides to take his family to the island of St. Pomme de Terre (\"Saint Potato\") to retrieve it so he can sell it. Katherine resists the idea, but agrees after Caroline announces she has just become engaged.\n\nWhen the Harveys arrive at the island, they discover that the yacht, the ''Wanderer'', is in terrible condition. Upon hearing this, the yacht broker cancels his plan to send an experienced captain to help them sail it to Miami, and instead hires a local sailor, Captain Ron Rico, a one-eyed man with a very laid back attitude, and Navy veteran who claims to have piloted the [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS ''Saratoga'']]. He launches immediately when he sees the car he arrived in roll off the dock and sink. Its owner arrives at the dock and shoots at him.\n\nCaptain Ron takes Ben's money in a game of Monopoly, giving him beer to drink and charging him for it later, but shows loyalty to Martin, who he refers to as \"Boss\". Martin, who doesn't like him, calls him \"[[moron (psychology)|Moron]]\" in his diary, and believes that he doesn't know what he's doing.\n\nThe Harveys decide to stop off in the Caribbean, but learn that Captain Ron doesn't know how to navigate. While on a random island, Martin decides to go on a nature hike, but runs into [[guerrilla]]s led by General Armando. Captain Ron bargains for Martin's freedom by giving them a lift to the next island, and receiving some firearms in return to fight off pirates. This angers Martin, as he declares there will be no firearms on his yacht and tosses them overboard, before realizing that without them, he is going to have to give the guerrillas a lift.\n\nIn the yacht's cabin, Katherine shows Martin the initials of Clark Gable and [[Carole Lombard]] marked on the bedpost. They are so excited that they share their feelings and have passionate sex.\n\nWhen they arrive at their next destination, [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]], Martin and Katherine are arrested for smuggling the guerrillas. Caroline and Ben party with the locals and Captain Ron, which ends with Caroline getting a tattoo, Ben breaking his glasses, and Captain Ron losing his glass eye. Martin and Katherine are released from jail, but forced to leave that night. Martin decides to leave Captain Ron behind and they encounter pirates who steal the yacht, and are stuck floating in a raft.\n\nThey land in [[Cuba]] and discover the yacht there. The pirates find them, but with the help of Captain Ron, they are able to escape with the yacht. Captain Ron learns that they underrate Martin, and he decides to play hurt, forcing Martin to take control of the escape. Using the skills that Captain Ron taught them, they are able to get the sails up after the engine breaks from lack of oil to distance themselves from the pirates. The [[United States Coast Guard]] fires once at the pirates, scaring them away and creates a safe passage to Miami.\n\nThey arrive in Miami and part ways with Captain Ron.

[[Mary Kay Place]], [[Meadow Sisto]], and [[Benjamin Salisbury]] also star as his wife and children.\n\n==Plot==\nMartin Harvey is a middle-aged office worker who lives in  [[Chicago]] with his wife, Katherine, 16-year-old daughter, Caroline, and 11-year-old son, Ben. When he learns his recently deceased uncle has bequeathed him a 60' yacht once owned by [[Clark Gable]], he decides to take his family to the island of St. Pomme de Terre (\"Saint Potato\") to retrieve it so he can sell it. Katherine resists the idea, but agrees after Caroline announces she has just become engaged.\n\nWhen the Harveys arrive at the island, they discover that the yacht, the ''Wanderer'', is in terrible condition. Upon hearing this, the yacht broker cancels his plan to send an experienced captain to help them sail it to Miami, and instead hires a local sailor, Captain Ron Rico, a one-eyed man with a very laid back attitude, and Navy veteran who claims to have piloted the [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS ''Saratoga'']]. He launches immediately when he sees the car he arrived in roll off the dock and sink. Its owner arrives at the dock and shoots at him.\n\nCaptain Ron takes Ben's money in a game of Monopoly, giving him beer to drink and charging him for it later, but shows loyalty to Martin, who he refers to as \"Boss\". Martin, who doesn't like him, calls him \"[[moron (psychology)|Moron]]\" in his diary, and believes that he doesn't know what he's doing.\n\nThe Harveys decide to stop off in the Caribbean, but learn that Captain Ron doesn't know how to navigate. While on a random island, Martin decides to go on a nature hike, but runs into [[guerrilla]]s led by General Armando. Captain Ron bargains for Martin's freedom by giving them a lift to the next island, and receiving some firearms in return to fight off pirates. This angers Martin, as he declares there will be no firearms on his yacht and tosses them overboard, before realizing that without them, he is going to have to give the guerrillas a lift.\n\nIn the yacht's cabin, Katherine shows Martin the initials of Clark Gable and [[Carole Lombard]] marked on the bedpost. They are so excited that they share their feelings and have passionate sex.\n\nWhen they arrive at their next destination, [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]], Martin and Katherine are arrested for smuggling the guerrillas. Caroline and Ben party with the locals and Captain Ron, which ends with Caroline getting a tattoo, Ben breaking his glasses, and Captain Ron losing his glass eye. Martin and Katherine are released from jail, but forced to leave that night. Martin decides to leave Captain Ron behind and they encounter pirates who steal the yacht, and are stuck floating in a raft.\n\nThey land in [[Cuba]] and discover the yacht there. The pirates find them, but with the help of Captain Ron, they are able to escape with the yacht. Captain Ron learns that they underrate Martin, and he decides to play hurt, forcing Martin to take control of the escape. Using the skills that Captain Ron taught them, they are able to get the sails up after the engine breaks from lack of oil to distance themselves from the pirates. The [[United States Coast Guard]] fires once at the pirates, scaring them away and creates a safe passage to Miami.\n\nThey arrive in Miami and part ways with Captain Ron. As they sail to their destination, they decide to turn the yacht around and keep it. In the final scene, Captain Ron appears to have cleaned up his appearance and has quickly taken on a new role as a captain for a wealthy couple and their small motorboat.
