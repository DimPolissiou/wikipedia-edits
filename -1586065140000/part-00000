Cruise lines have a dual character; they are partly in the transportation business, and partly in the leisure entertainment business, a duality that carries down into the ships themselves, which have both a crew headed by the ship's captain, and a hospitality staff headed by the equivalent of a hotel manager.\n\nBecause of mergers and consolidations, a cruise line may also be a brand of a larger holding corporation. For example, as noted below, [[Carnival Cruise Line]] and [[Holland America Line]] are cruise lines within the larger parent corporation [[Carnival Corporation & plc]]. This industry practice of using the brand, not the larger parent corporation, as the cruise line is also followed in the member cruise lines in [[Cruise Lines International Association]] (CLIA);<ref>{{cite web|title=Member Cruise Lines|url=http://www.cruising.org/cruise-vacationer/member-cruise-lines|website=Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA)|accessdate=26 June 2016}}</ref> the listing of cruise ship sales, transfers,<ref>{{cite web|title=Ship sales and transfers|url=http://www.cruiseindustrynews.com/cruise-news/cruise-ship-sales.html|website=Cruise industry news|accessdate=26 June 2016}}</ref> and new orders;<ref>{{cite web|title=Cruise ship orderbook|url=http://www.cruiseindustrynews.com/cruise-news/cruise-ship-orderbook.html|website=Cruise Industry News|accessdate=26 June 2016}}</ref> cruise line market share;<ref>{{cite web|title=Cruise line market share|url=http://www.cruisemarketwatch.com/market-share/|website=Cruise market watch|accessdate=26 June 2016}}</ref> and the member-based reviews of cruise lines.<ref>{{cite web|title=Member reviews of cruise lines|url=http://www.cruisecritic.com/memberreviews/cruise-lines/|website=Cruise Critic|accessdate=26 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nCruise ships can cruise in oceans or rivers.

Its crown is speckled, dark grey on brown plumage. The juvenile bird has a characteristic yellow cheek sash, although this is less pronounced in the adult bird, where predominantly the cheek is white with a grey and/or brown streak under the cheek.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Field guide to the birds of Australia|last=Simpson|first=K.|last2=Day|first2=N.|publisher=Penguin group Australian|year=2010|isbn=|edition=8th|location=Melbourne|pages=}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Birds of Australia: Photographic field guide|last=Flagg|first=Jim|publisher=Reed New Holland|year=2002|isbn=1 876334 78 9|location=Sydney|pages=294\u2013295}}</ref>\n\nIts beak is long and straight with a black tip and a fleshy red or pink colour towards the chin and up to the [[Beak|gape]]. The characteristic face pattern includes a long, dark stripe through the eyes to the ear coverts. The breast is creamy-white with short, browny streaks. The throat is often a light brown or cinnamon, sometimes extending from the beak to the upper breast. The wing feathers are a mottled, dark olive-brown to grey with white edges. The tail has similar colouring, but the tips of the tail-feathers are white. The [[Covert feather|under-tail coverts]] are white or, on some birds, light grey, and often streaked.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThere seems to be an amount of variability in the appearance of many birds in this species. One example is on the [[Mornington Peninsula]], located on the eastern coast of Port Phillip Bay in Victoria, where the spiny-cheeked honeyeaters have darker bellies. The juvenile birds of the species have a brown iris, and the facial skin is paler on the beak.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Habitat ==\n\nThe spiny-cheeked honeyeater can be found in most locations throughout Australia, except east of the Great Dividing Range, Tasmania, the far south-west of Western Australia, and the northern Australian tropics.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://bie.ala.org.au/search?q=Spiny-cheeked+Honeyeater|title=Spiny-cheeked Honeyeater {{!}} Search|last=Australia|first=Atlas of Living|website=bie.ala.org.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2017-06-09}}</ref> However, the birds do occur on [[Kangaroo Island]] in South Australia.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.birdsinbackyards.net/species/Acanthagenys-rufogularis|title=Spiny-cheeked Honeyeater {{!}} BIRDS in BACKYARDS|website=www.birdsinbackyards.net|access-date=2017-06-09}}</ref>\n\nMost sightings have been in sparse, woody tree environments.

Its crown is speckled, dark grey on brown plumage. The juvenile bird has a characteristic yellow cheek sash, although this is less pronounced in the adult bird, where predominantly the cheek is white with a grey and/or brown streak under the cheek.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Field guide to the birds of Australia|last=Simpson|first=K.|last2=Day|first2=N.|publisher=Penguin group Australian|year=2010|isbn=|edition=8th|location=Melbourne|pages=}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Birds of Australia: Photographic field guide|last=Flagg|first=Jim|publisher=Reed New Holland|year=2002|isbn=1 876334 78 9|location=Sydney|pages=294\u2013295}}</ref>\n\nIts beak is long and straight with a black tip and a fleshy red or pink colour towards the chin and up to the [[Beak|gape]]. The characteristic face pattern includes a long, dark stripe through the eyes to the ear coverts. The breast is creamy-white with short, browny streaks. The throat is often a light brown or cinnamon, sometimes extending from the beak to the upper breast. The wing feathers are a mottled, dark olive-brown to grey with white edges. The tail has similar colouring, but the tips of the tail-feathers are white. The [[Covert feather|under-tail coverts]] are white or, on some birds, light grey, and often streaked.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThere seems to be an amount of variability in the appearance of many birds in this species. One example is on the [[Mornington Peninsula]], located on the eastern coast of Port Phillip Bay in Victoria, where the spiny-cheeked honeyeaters have darker bellies. The juvenile birds of the species have a brown iris, and the facial skin is paler on the beak.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Habitat ==\n\nThe spiny-cheeked honeyeater can be found in most locations throughout Australia, except east of the Great Dividing Range, Tasmania, the far south-west of Western Australia, and the northern Australian tropics.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://bie.ala.org.au/search?q=Spiny-cheeked+Honeyeater|title=Spiny-cheeked Honeyeater {{!}} Search|last=Australia|first=Atlas of Living|website=bie.ala.org.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2017-06-09}}</ref> However, the birds do occur on [[Kangaroo Island]] in South Australia.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.birdsinbackyards.net/species/Acanthagenys-rufogularis|title=Spiny-cheeked Honeyeater {{!}} BIRDS in BACKYARDS|website=www.birdsinbackyards.net|access-date=2017-06-09}}</ref>\n\nMost sightings have been in sparse, woody tree environments.

The ships departed with an estimated 775 convicts (582 men and 193 women), as well as officers, marines, their wives and children, and provisions and agricultural implements. After 43 convicts had died during the eight-month trip, 732 landed at [[Sydney Cove]].<ref>{{harvnb|Gillen|1989|page=445}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, the First Fleet Garden, a memorial to the First Fleet immigrants, friends and others was created on the banks of [[Quirindi]] Creek at [[Wallabadah, New South Wales]]. Stonemason Ray Collins researched and then carved the names of all those who came out to Australia on the eleven ships in 1788 on tablets along the garden pathways. The stories of those who arrived on the ships, their life, and first encounters with the Australian country are presented throughout the garden.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/travel/travel-factsheet/wallabadah--places-to-see-20081126-6i43.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=9 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706220348/http://www.theage.com.au/travel/travel-factsheet/wallabadah--places-to-see-20081126-6i43.html |archivedate=6 July 2009 }}</ref>\n\nNo single definitive list of people who travelled on those ships exists; however, historians have pieced together as much data about these pioneers as possible. In the late 1980s, a simple software program with a [[database]] of convicts became available for Australian school students, both as a history and an information technology learning guide.
