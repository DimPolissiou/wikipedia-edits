The ground was quickly nicknamed the \"Sand Pit\" as its sandy surface was constantly shifting under the feet of players. Both Maroons centres [[Justin Hodges]] and [[Paul Bowman (rugby league)|Paul Bowman]], were taken from the field with serious knee injuries which were later blamed on the shifting surface.\n\nThe Blues pack led by interchange prop [[Luke Bailey (rugby league)|Luke Bailey]], hammered their Maroons counterparts and gave Johns plenty of room to weave his magic.

Johns was again the catalyst starting the scoring with a brilliant banana kick that rebounded off the cross bar, went through the hands of [[Michael De Vere]] and fell to the ground before [[Ben Kennedy (rugby league)|Ben Kennedy]] pounced.\n\nThere was no greater example of the brilliant halfback's influence than the last minute before the break. Johns kicked for touch from a 20-metre restart, then after winning the ensuing scrum, hoisted a bomb high into the air which was contested before being batted back into his hands. Without a second thought and while on the run, he potted a 25-metre field goal with ease.\n\nThe final score was 27-4 to the Blues who remained unbeaten from seven matches on their home turf of [[Telstra Stadium]].\n\n==Game III==\n{{rugbyleaguebox |brian fletcher\nbg = #eeeeee |\ndate = Wednesday, 16 July 2003 |\nteam2 =  [[Image:New South Wales colours.svg|16px]] [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]] |\nscore = 36\u20136 |\nreport = [http://stats.rleague.com/rl/soo/game69.html (Report)] |\nteam1 = [[Image:Queensland colours.svg|16px]] [[Queensland State of Origin Team|Queensland]] |\npoints1 = [[Matt Sing]] ('''12''' - 3t) <br /> [[Brent Tate]] ('''8''' - 2t) <br /> [[Josh Hannay]] ('''8''' - 4g) <br /> [[Cameron Smith]] ('''4''' - 1t) <br /> [[Michael Crocker]] ('''4 '''- 1t) |\npoints2 = ('''4 '''- 1t) [[Timana Tahu]] <br /> ('''2''' - 1g) [[Andrew Johns]] |\nstadium = [[Suncorp Stadium]], [[Brisbane]] |\nattendance = 52,130 |\nreferee= [[Bill Harrigan]]<ref>[http://www.nrlstats.com/origin/match.cfm?MatchID=11211 2003 Game III] at ''nrlstats.com''</ref> |\nmanofmatch= [[Matt Sing]] }}\n\nGame III, otherwise known as the \"[[dead rubber]]\", restored some much needed pride for the Maroons who dominated the Blues in every facet of the game. Winger [[Matt Sing]] was superb, scoring three tries in a man-of-the match performance.\n\nQueensland started with a new-found zest and led 16-0 after just 17 minutes before strangling the Blues out of the contest. Johns was forced to accept the shield in front of an almost empty stadium after Queensland had completed a lap of honour. It was an anti-climactic end to what had been the gifted number seven's best ever series. Queensland's [[dead rubber]] win equalled their biggest ever State of Origin victory, which was first equalled in 1989, and then again in [[2008 State of Origin series#Game II|2008]], before it was broken in the [[2015 State of Origin series#Game III|third game of the 2015 series]].\n\n==Teams==\nA total of twelve players from the [[2003 Brisbane Broncos season]] were selected to play in the series, making them the most heavily represented club.

Without a second thought and while on the run, he potted a 25-metre field goal with ease.\n\nThe final score was 27-4 to the Blues who remained unbeaten from seven matches on their home turf of [[Telstra Stadium]].\n\n==Game III==\n{{rugbyleaguebox |brian fletcher\nbg = #eeeeee |\ndate = Wednesday, 16 July 2003 |\nteam2 =  [[Image:New South Wales colours.svg|16px]] [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]] |\nscore = 36\u20136 |\nreport = [http://stats.rleague.com/rl/soo/game69.html (Report)] |\nteam1 = [[Image:Queensland colours.svg|16px]] [[Queensland State of Origin Team|Queensland]] |\npoints1 = [[Matt Sing]] ('''12''' - 3t) <br /> [[Brent Tate]] ('''8''' - 2t) <br /> [[Josh Hannay]] ('''8''' - 4g) <br /> [[Cameron Smith]] ('''4''' - 1t) <br /> [[Michael Crocker]] ('''4 '''- 1t) |\npoints2 = ('''4 '''- 1t) [[Timana Tahu]] <br /> ('''2''' - 1g) [[Andrew Johns]] |\nstadium = [[Suncorp Stadium]], [[Brisbane]] |\nattendance = 52,130 |\nreferee= [[Bill Harrigan]]<ref>[http://www.nrlstats.com/origin/match.cfm?MatchID=11211 2003 Game III] at ''nrlstats.com''</ref> |\nmanofmatch= [[Matt Sing]] }}\n\nGame III, otherwise known as the \"[[dead rubber]]\", restored some much needed pride for the Maroons who dominated the Blues in every facet of the game. Winger [[Matt Sing]] was superb, scoring three tries in a man-of-the match performance.\n\nQueensland started with a new-found zest and led 16-0 after just 17 minutes before strangling the Blues out of the contest. Johns was forced to accept the shield in front of an almost empty stadium after Queensland had completed a lap of honour. It was an anti-climactic end to what had been the gifted number seven's best ever series. Queensland's [[dead rubber]] win equalled their biggest ever State of Origin victory, which was first equalled in 1989, and then again in [[2008 State of Origin series#Game II|2008]], before it was broken in the [[2015 State of Origin series#Game III|third game of the 2015 series]].\n\n==Teams==\nA total of twelve players from the [[2003 Brisbane Broncos season]] were selected to play in the series, making them the most heavily represented club.

AEW&C units are also used to carry out [[Aerial surveillance|surveillance]], including [[Airborne ground surveillance|over ground targets]] and frequently perform C2BM (command and control, [[battle management]]) functions similar to an [[Air Traffic Control]]ler given military command over other forces. When used at altitude, the radar on the aircraft allows the operators to detect and track targets and distinguish between friendly and hostile aircraft much farther away than a similar ground-based radar.<ref>Neufeld, 1997, p.276</ref> Like a ground-based radar, it can be detected by opposing forces, but because of its mobility, it is much less vulnerable to counter-attack.<ref>Neufeld, 1997, p.278</ref>\n\nThe first known aerial engagement with both opposing sides using Airborne Early Warning and Control aircraft was in South Asia, during the [[2019 Jammu and Kashmir airstrikes|February 27, 2019 aerial engagemen]]<nowiki/>t between [[India]] and [[Pakistan]], with India using [[EL/W-2090|A-50I Phalcon]] AWACS and Pakistan using the [[Saab 2000]].<ref>http://forceindia.net/cover-story/the-lessons/</ref>\n\nAEW&C aircraft are used for both defensive and offensive air operations, and are to the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization|NATO]] and US forces trained or integrated [[Air Force]]s what the [[combat information center]] is to a [[United States Navy|US Navy]] [[warship]], plus a highly mobile and powerful radar platform. The system is used offensively to direct fighters to their target locations, and defensively, directing counterattacks on enemy forces, both air and ground. So useful is the advantage of command and control from a high altitude, the US Navy operates [[Northrop Grumman E-2 Hawkeye]] AEW&C aircraft from its [[supercarrier]]s to augment and protect its carrier Command Information Centers (CICs). The designation ''airborne early warning'' (AEW) was used for earlier similar aircraft,<ref>Gordon, 2010, p.3</ref> such as the [[Fairey Gannet AEW.3]] and [[Lockheed EC-121 Warning Star]], and continues to be used by the RAF for its [[Boeing E-3 Sentry|Sentry AEW1]], while AEW&C (airborne early warning and control) emphasizes the [[Command and Control (Military)|command and control]] capabilities that may not be present on smaller or simpler radar picket aircraft. '''AWACS''' (Airborne Warning and Control System) is the name of the specific system installed in the E-3 and Japanese [[Boeing E-767]] AEW&C airframes, but is often used as a general synonym for AEW&C.<ref>[http://boeing.mediaroom.com/1998-03-11-Boeing-Delivers-First-Two-767-AWACS-Introduces-Newest-Member-of-AEW-C-Family Boeing Delivers First Two 767 AWACS, Introduces Newest Member of AEW&C Family]</ref><ref name=gap />\n\n==General characteristics==\n[[File:Wellington Ic (R1629).jpg|thumb|Wellington Ic \"Air Controlled Interception\" showing rotating radar antenna]]\n\nModern AEW&C systems can detect aircraft from up to {{convert|400|km|nmi|abbr=on}} away, well out of range of most surface-to-air missiles.

The intention was to cover the North West approaches where German long range [[Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor]] aircraft were threatening shipping. A [[Vickers Wellington]] bomber (serial R1629) was fitted with a rotating antenna array. It was tested for use against aerial targets and then for possible use against German [[E boat]]s.<ref>''Air-Britain'', Aviation World, 2004</ref><ref>Hodges, R \"Air controlled interception\" ''Radar Development to 1945'' R W Burns (ed)</ref> Another radar equipped Wellington with a different installation was used to direct [[Bristol Beaufighter]]s toward [[Heinkel He 111]]s, which were air-launching [[V-1 flying bomb]]s.<ref>''Flypast'' April 1987: \"The First AWACS\"</ref>\n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M with F-4B.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lockheed EC-121]]M showing characteristic radar domes above and below fuselage]]\nIn February 1944, the US Navy ordered the development of a radar system that could be carried aloft in an aircraft under Project Cadillac. A prototype system was built and flown in August on a modified [[Grumman TBF Avenger|TBM Avenger]] [[torpedo bomber]]. Tests were successful, with the system being able to detect low flying formations at a range greater than {{convert|100|mi|km}}. The US Navy then ordered production of the TBM-3W, the first production AEW aircraft to enter service. TBM-3Ws fitted with the [[list of radars|AN/APS-20]] radar entered service in March 1945, with some 36\u201340 eventually constructed.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nThe [[Lockheed EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV and EC-121 Warning Star]], which first flew in 1949, served widely with the US Air Force and US Navy. It provided the main AEW coverage for US forces during the Vietnam war. It remained operational until replaced with the E-3 AWACS. Developed roughly in parallel, [[N-class blimp]]s were also used as AEW aircraft, filling gaps in radar coverage for the continental US, their tremendous endurance of over 200 hours being a major asset in an AEW aircraft. Lighter than air operations were discontinued in 1962 following a crash.\n\nIn 1958, the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Tupolev|Tupolev Design Bureau]] was ordered to design an AEW aircraft.<ref name=Tu-114.1>Gordon, 2006, p.86</ref> After determining that the projected radar instrumentation wouldn't fit in a [[Tupolev Tu-95]] or a [[Tupolev Tu-116]], the decision was made to use the more capacious [[Tupolev Tu-114]] instead.<ref name=Tu-114.1 /> This solved the problems with cooling and operator space that existed with the narrower Tu-95 and Tu-116 fuselage.<ref name=Tu-114.1 /> To meet range requirements, production examples were fitted with an air-to-air refueling probe.<ref name=Tu-114.2>Gordon, 2006, p.87</ref> The resulting system, the [[Tupolev Tu-126]], entered service in 1965 with the [[Soviet Air Forces]] and remained in service until replaced by the [[Beriev A-50]] in 1984.<ref name=Tu-114.2 />\n\n==Current systems==\n[[File:Aeronaves \u00c1gata 7 - FAB - EMB145 Erieye.jpg|thumb|right|[[Embraer R-99|Embraer E-99]] airborne early warning and control]]\n\nMany countries have developed their own AEW&C systems, although the [[Boeing E-3 Sentry]] and [[Northrop Grumman E-2 Hawkeye]] are the most common systems worldwide. The E-3 Sentry was built by the [[Boeing]] Defense and Space Group (now [[Boeing Defense, Space & Security]]) and was based on the [[Boeing 707|Boeing 707-320]] aircraft. Sixty-five E-3s were built and it is operated by the US, NATO, the UK, France, and Saudi Arabia.<ref>Neufeld, 1997, p.275</ref> For the [[Japan Air Self-Defense Force]], the E-3 technology has been fitted into the [[Boeing E-767]].\n\nThe specially designed [[Grumman E-2 Hawkeye]] entered service in 1965 and has been operated by eight nations. Over 168 have been produced, and new versions continue to be developed, making it the most widely used AEW system. \n\nAfter WWII, the [[United Kingdom]] deployed a substantial AEW capability with American [[Douglas A-1 Skyraider|Douglas AD-4W Skyraiders]], designated Skyraider AEW.1, which in turn were replaced by the [[Fairey Gannet AEW|Fairey Gannet AEW.3]], using the same AN/APS-20 radar. With the retirement of conventional aircraft carriers, the Gannet was withdrawn and the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) installed the radars from the Gannets on [[Avro Shackleton]] MR.2 airframes, redesignated Shackleton AEW.2. To replace the Shackleton AEW.2, an AEW variant of the [[Hawker Siddeley Nimrod]], known as the [[British Aerospace Nimrod AEW3|Nimrod AEW3]], was ordered in 1974. After a protracted and problematic development, this was cancelled in 1986, and seven E-3Ds, [[British military aircraft designation systems|designated]] Sentry AEW.1 in RAF service, were purchased instead.<ref name=\"spyflight\">[http://www.spyflight.co.uk/nim%20aew.htm \"BAe Nimrod AEW 3.\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502141328/http://www.spyflight.co.uk/Nim%20aew.htm |date=2012-05-02 }} ''Spyflight.''

The \"Mainstay\" is based on the [[Ilyushin Il-76]] airframe, with a large non-rotating disk radome on the rear fuselage. These replaced the 12 [[Tupolev Tu-126]] that filled the role previously. The A-50 and A-50U will eventually be replaced by the [[Beriev A-100]], which features an AESA array in the radome and is based on the updated Il-476.<ref>Butowski, Piotr. \"Model Reveals A-100 Configuration\". ''[[Air International]]'', April 2014. Retrieved: 21 July 2014.</ref>\n\nIn May 1997, Russia and Israel agreed to jointly fulfill an order from China to develop and deliver an early warning system. China reportedly ordered one [[EL/M-2075|Phalcon]] for $250 million, which entailed retrofitting a Russian-made Ilyushin-76 cargo plane [also incorrectly reported as a Beriev A-50 Mainstay] with advanced Elta electronic, computer, radar and communications systems. Beijing was expected to acquire several Phalcon AEW systems, and reportedly could buy at least three more [and possibly up to eight] of these systems, the prototype of which was planned for testing beginning in 2000. In July 2000 the US pressured Israel to back out of the $1 billion agreement to sell China four Phalcon phased-array radar systems. Following the cancelled A-50I/Phalcon deal, China turned to indigenous solutions. The Phalcon radar and other electronic systems were taken off from the unfinished Il-76, and the airframe was handed to China via Russia in 2002. The Chinese AWACS has a unique phased array radar (PAR) carried in a round radome. Unlike the US AWACS aircraft, which rotate their rotodomes to give a 360 degree coverage, the radar antenna of the Chinese AWACS does not rotate. Instead, three PAR antenna modules are placed in a triangular configuration inside the round radome to provide a 360 degree coverage.

AEW&C units are also used to carry out [[Aerial surveillance|surveillance]], including [[Airborne ground surveillance|over ground targets]] and frequently perform C2BM (command and control, [[battle management]]) functions similar to an [[Air Traffic Control]]ler given military command over other forces. When used at altitude, the radar on the aircraft allows the operators to detect and track targets and distinguish between friendly and hostile aircraft much farther away than a similar ground-based radar.<ref>Neufeld, 1997, p.276</ref> Like a ground-based radar, it can be detected by opposing forces, but because of its mobility, it is much less vulnerable to counter-attack.<ref>Neufeld, 1997, p.278</ref>\n\nThe first known aerial engagement with both opposing sides using Airborne Early Warning and Control aircraft was in South Asia, during the [[2019 Jammu and Kashmir airstrikes|February 27, 2019 aerial engagemen]]<nowiki/>t between [[India]] and [[Pakistan]], with India using [[EL/W-2090|A-50I Phalcon]] AWACS and Pakistan using the [[Saab 2000]].<ref>http://forceindia.net/cover-story/the-lessons/</ref>\n\nAEW&C aircraft are used for both defensive and offensive air operations, and are to the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization|NATO]] and US forces trained or integrated [[Air Force]]s what the [[combat information center]] is to a [[United States Navy|US Navy]] [[warship]], plus a highly mobile and powerful radar platform. The system is used offensively to direct fighters to their target locations, and defensively, directing counterattacks on enemy forces, both air and ground. So useful is the advantage of command and control from a high altitude, the US Navy operates [[Northrop Grumman E-2 Hawkeye]] AEW&C aircraft from its [[supercarrier]]s to augment and protect its carrier Command Information Centers (CICs). The designation ''airborne early warning'' (AEW) was used for earlier similar aircraft,<ref>Gordon, 2010, p.3</ref> such as the [[Fairey Gannet AEW.3]] and [[Lockheed EC-121 Warning Star]], and continues to be used by the RAF for its [[Boeing E-3 Sentry|Sentry AEW1]], while AEW&C (airborne early warning and control) emphasizes the [[Command and Control (Military)|command and control]] capabilities that may not be present on smaller or simpler radar picket aircraft. '''AWACS''' (Airborne Warning and Control System) is the name of the specific system installed in the E-3 and Japanese [[Boeing E-767]] AEW&C airframes, but is often used as a general synonym for AEW&C.<ref>[http://boeing.mediaroom.com/1998-03-11-Boeing-Delivers-First-Two-767-AWACS-Introduces-Newest-Member-of-AEW-C-Family Boeing Delivers First Two 767 AWACS, Introduces Newest Member of AEW&C Family]</ref><ref name=gap />\n\n==General characteristics==\n[[File:Wellington Ic (R1629).jpg|thumb|Wellington Ic \"Air Controlled Interception\" showing rotating radar antenna]]\n\nModern AEW&C systems can detect aircraft from up to {{convert|400|km|nmi|abbr=on}} away, well out of range of most surface-to-air missiles.

The intention was to cover the North West approaches where German long range [[Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor]] aircraft were threatening shipping. A [[Vickers Wellington]] bomber (serial R1629) was fitted with a rotating antenna array. It was tested for use against aerial targets and then for possible use against German [[E boat]]s.<ref>''Air-Britain'', Aviation World, 2004</ref><ref>Hodges, R \"Air controlled interception\" ''Radar Development to 1945'' R W Burns (ed)</ref> Another radar equipped Wellington with a different installation was used to direct [[Bristol Beaufighter]]s toward [[Heinkel He 111]]s, which were air-launching [[V-1 flying bomb]]s.<ref>''Flypast'' April 1987: \"The First AWACS\"</ref>\n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M with F-4B.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lockheed EC-121]]M showing characteristic radar domes above and below fuselage]]\nIn February 1944, the US Navy ordered the development of a radar system that could be carried aloft in an aircraft under Project Cadillac. A prototype system was built and flown in August on a modified [[Grumman TBF Avenger|TBM Avenger]] [[torpedo bomber]]. Tests were successful, with the system being able to detect low flying formations at a range greater than {{convert|100|mi|km}}. The US Navy then ordered production of the TBM-3W, the first production AEW aircraft to enter service. TBM-3Ws fitted with the [[list of radars|AN/APS-20]] radar entered service in March 1945, with some 36\u201340 eventually constructed.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nThe [[Lockheed EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV and EC-121 Warning Star]], which first flew in 1949, served widely with the US Air Force and US Navy. It provided the main AEW coverage for US forces during the Vietnam war. It remained operational until replaced with the E-3 AWACS. Developed roughly in parallel, [[N-class blimp]]s were also used as AEW aircraft, filling gaps in radar coverage for the continental US, their tremendous endurance of over 200 hours being a major asset in an AEW aircraft. Lighter than air operations were discontinued in 1962 following a crash.\n\nIn 1958, the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Tupolev|Tupolev Design Bureau]] was ordered to design an AEW aircraft.<ref name=Tu-114.1>Gordon, 2006, p.86</ref> After determining that the projected radar instrumentation wouldn't fit in a [[Tupolev Tu-95]] or a [[Tupolev Tu-116]], the decision was made to use the more capacious [[Tupolev Tu-114]] instead.<ref name=Tu-114.1 /> This solved the problems with cooling and operator space that existed with the narrower Tu-95 and Tu-116 fuselage.<ref name=Tu-114.1 /> To meet range requirements, production examples were fitted with an air-to-air refueling probe.<ref name=Tu-114.2>Gordon, 2006, p.87</ref> The resulting system, the [[Tupolev Tu-126]], entered service in 1965 with the [[Soviet Air Forces]] and remained in service until replaced by the [[Beriev A-50]] in 1984.<ref name=Tu-114.2 />\n\n==Current systems==\n[[File:Aeronaves \u00c1gata 7 - FAB - EMB145 Erieye.jpg|thumb|right|[[Embraer R-99|Embraer E-99]] airborne early warning and control]]\n\nMany countries have developed their own AEW&C systems, although the [[Boeing E-3 Sentry]] and [[Northrop Grumman E-2 Hawkeye]] are the most common systems worldwide. The E-3 Sentry was built by the [[Boeing]] Defense and Space Group (now [[Boeing Defense, Space & Security]]) and was based on the [[Boeing 707|Boeing 707-320]] aircraft. Sixty-five E-3s were built and it is operated by the US, NATO, the UK, France, and Saudi Arabia.<ref>Neufeld, 1997, p.275</ref> For the [[Japan Air Self-Defense Force]], the E-3 technology has been fitted into the [[Boeing E-767]].\n\nThe specially designed [[Grumman E-2 Hawkeye]] entered service in 1965 and has been operated by eight nations. Over 168 have been produced, and new versions continue to be developed, making it the most widely used AEW system. \n\nAfter WWII, the [[United Kingdom]] deployed a substantial AEW capability with American [[Douglas A-1 Skyraider|Douglas AD-4W Skyraiders]], designated Skyraider AEW.1, which in turn were replaced by the [[Fairey Gannet AEW|Fairey Gannet AEW.3]], using the same AN/APS-20 radar. With the retirement of conventional aircraft carriers, the Gannet was withdrawn and the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) installed the radars from the Gannets on [[Avro Shackleton]] MR.2 airframes, redesignated Shackleton AEW.2. To replace the Shackleton AEW.2, an AEW variant of the [[Hawker Siddeley Nimrod]], known as the [[British Aerospace Nimrod AEW3|Nimrod AEW3]], was ordered in 1974. After a protracted and problematic development, this was cancelled in 1986, and seven E-3Ds, [[British military aircraft designation systems|designated]] Sentry AEW.1 in RAF service, were purchased instead.<ref name=\"spyflight\">[http://www.spyflight.co.uk/nim%20aew.htm \"BAe Nimrod AEW 3.\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502141328/http://www.spyflight.co.uk/Nim%20aew.htm |date=2012-05-02 }} ''Spyflight.''

''[[Air International]]'', April 2014. Retrieved: 21 July 2014.</ref>\n\nIn May 1997, Russia and Israel agreed to jointly fulfill an order from China to develop and deliver an early warning system. China reportedly ordered one [[EL/M-2075|Phalcon]] for $250 million, which entailed retrofitting a Russian-made Ilyushin-76 cargo plane [also incorrectly reported as a Beriev A-50 Mainstay] with advanced Elta electronic, computer, radar and communications systems. Beijing was expected to acquire several Phalcon AEW systems, and reportedly could buy at least three more [and possibly up to eight] of these systems, the prototype of which was planned for testing beginning in 2000. In July 2000 the US pressured Israel to back out of the $1 billion agreement to sell China four Phalcon phased-array radar systems. Following the cancelled A-50I/Phalcon deal, China turned to indigenous solutions. The Phalcon radar and other electronic systems were taken off from the unfinished Il-76, and the airframe was handed to China via Russia in 2002. The Chinese AWACS has a unique phased array radar (PAR) carried in a round radome. Unlike the US AWACS aircraft, which rotate their rotodomes to give a 360 degree coverage, the radar antenna of the Chinese AWACS does not rotate. Instead, three PAR antenna modules are placed in a triangular configuration inside the round radome to provide a 360 degree coverage.

However, if the number of platelets is too high, blood clots can form thrombosis, which may obstruct blood vessels and result in such events as a [[stroke]], [[myocardial infarction]], [[pulmonary embolism]], or blockage of blood vessels to other parts of the body, such as the extremities of the arms or legs. An abnormality or disease of the platelets is called a thrombocytopathy, which can be either a low number of platelets ([[thrombocytopenia]]), a decrease in function of platelets (thrombasthenia), or an increase in the number of platelets (thrombocytosis). There are disorders that reduce the number of platelets, such as [[heparin-induced thrombocytopenia]] (HIT) or [[thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura]] (TTP), that typically cause thromboses, or clots, instead of bleeding.\n\nPlatelets release a multitude of growth factors including [[platelet-derived growth factor]] (PDGF), a potent chemotactic agent, and [[TGF beta]], which stimulates the deposition of extracellular matrix. Both of these growth factors have been shown to play a significant role in the repair and regeneration of connective tissues. Other healing-associated growth factors produced by platelets include [[basic fibroblast growth factor]], [[insulin-like growth factor 1]], platelet-derived epidermal growth factor, and [[vascular endothelial growth factor]].

A scientist or lab technician performs the requested testing and provides the requesting medical professional with the results of the CBC. In the past, counting the cells in a patient's blood was performed manually, by viewing a slide prepared with a sample of the patient's blood under a microscope. Today, this process is generally automated by use of an automated analyzer, with only approximately 10-20% of samples now being examined manually. Abnormally high or low counts may indicate the presence of many forms of disease, and hence blood counts are amongst the most commonly performed blood tests in medicine, as they can provide an overview of a patient's general health status.\n\n==Discovery==\n\nIn 1658 Dutch naturalist [[Jan Swammerdam]] was the first person to observe red blood cells under a microscope, and in 1695, [[microscopist]] [[Antoni van Leeuwenhoek]], also Dutch, was the first to draw an illustration of \"red corpuscles\", as they were called. No further blood cells were discovered until 1842 when French physician [[Alfred Donn\u00e9]] discovered platelets. The following year leukocytes were first observed by [[Gabriel Andral]], a French professor of medicine, and [[William Addison (physician)|William Addison]], a British physician, simultaneously. Both men believed that both red and white cells were altered in disease. With these discoveries, [[hematology]], a new field of medicine, was established. Even though agents for staining tissues and cells were available, almost no advances were made in knowledge about the morphology of blood cells until 1879, when [[Paul Ehrlich]] published his technique for staining blood films and his method for differential blood cell counting.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hajdu |first1=Steven I. |title=A Note from History: The Discovery of Blood Cells |journal=Ann Clin Lab Sci |date=2003 |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=237-8 |pmid=12817630}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Commonscatinline|Blood cells}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Blood Cell}}\n[[Category:Blood cells| ]]\n[[Category:1658 in science]]\n", "text_old": "{{redirect|Blood Cells|the journal formerly known as Blood Cells|Blood Cells, Molecules and Diseases}}\n{{redirect|Hemocyte|invertebrate immune system cells|Hemocyte (invertebrate immune system cell)}}\n[[File:Hematopoiesis simple.svg|thumb|400px|Diagram showing the development of different blood cells from [[hematopoietic stem cell]]s to mature cells.]]\n\n{{Refimprove|date=September 2019}}\nA '''blood cell''', also called a '''hematopoietic cell''', '''hemocyte''', or '''hematocyte''', is a [[Cell (biology)|cell]] produced through [[hematopoiesis]] and found mainly in the [[blood]].

In the past, counting the cells in a patient's blood was performed manually, by viewing a slide prepared with a sample of the patient's blood under a microscope. Today, this process is generally automated by use of an automated analyzer, with only approximately 10-20% of samples now being examined manually. Abnormally high or low counts may indicate the presence of many forms of disease, and hence blood counts are amongst the most commonly performed blood tests in medicine, as they can provide an overview of a patient's general health status.\n\n==Discovery==\n\nIn 1658 Dutch naturalist [[Jan Swammerdam]] was the first person to observe red blood cells under a microscope, and in 1695, [[microscopist]] [[Antoni van Leeuwenhoek]], also Dutch, was the first to draw an illustration of \"red corpuscles\", as they were called. No further blood cells were discovered until 1842 when French physician [[Alfred Donn\u00e9]] discovered platelets. The following year leukocytes were first observed by [[Gabriel Andral]], a French professor of medicine, and [[William Addison (physician)|William Addison]], a British physician, simultaneously. Both men believed that both red and white cells were altered in disease. With these discoveries, [[hematology]], a new field of medicine, was established. Even though agents for staining tissues and cells were available, almost no advances were made in knowledge about the morphology of blood cells until 1879, when [[Paul Ehrlich]] published his technique for staining blood films and his method for differential blood cell counting.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hajdu |first1=Steven I. |title=A Note from History: The Discovery of Blood Cells |journal=Ann Clin Lab Sci |date=2003 |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=237-8 |pmid=12817630}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Commonscatinline|Blood cells}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Blood Cell}}\n[[Category:Blood cells| ]]\n[[Category:1658 in science]]\n", "name_user": "2405:205:1101:23fa:6f70:ba49:24e1:7868", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_cell"}

In 1993, after years of lobbying, the federal and provincial governments confirmed funding for capital expenses in the sum of $6.3 million. In 1994, The Group became the sub-tenant with a long-term lease until 2091.

As of 2016, the DX Permanent Collection contained approximately 600 items, however, the collection was deaccessioned in 2019.  Design Exchange has mounted more than 400 exhibitions, organized hundreds of seminars, lectures, international conferences and educational programs and publications related to the role of design in culture, industry, and business.\n\nFrom 2003-2011, under the leadership of President and CEO Samantha Sannella, the Design Exchange focused on promoting the value of Canadian design and its contribution to the economy, environment and quality of life. During this time, the DX hosted numerous domestic and international exhibitions and created hundreds of programs with the goal to educate the public.  This included the creation of Design Camps and an extensive curriculum was developed targeting children 18 and under - with a special outreach program entitled, Designers in the Classroom.  Numerous annual design competitions for high school students and university students were created that awarded scholarships nationally for design excellence.  Additionally, workshops, lectures and classes for adults were held monthly.  Notable exhibits included:  Costume Design from the Academy Awards, Canadian Architecture curated by Chris Hume, Japan 100 Design, Milano: Italian Design curated by Studio Zuccaro, Design for the Other 90%, New Materials in Design, Carrot City and Tokyo Doll. Industry events included the annual the Design Exchange awards. This was a national design competition open to professional designers across Canada. The awards promoted Canadian design excellence and recognize the critical role of design in business. The Awards celebrated the success stories achieved through close partnerships between clients and designers. Projects were recognized for balancing function, aesthetics, and economic success. During this period, all major design disciplines were emphasized:  Architecture, Interior Design, Fashion, Industrial Design and Graphic Design and the DX published many books across these themes including:  Ourtopias, a collection of essays about cities and their role in design, edited by Paola Poletto and Phillip Beasley and The Art of Clairtone, by Nina Munk and Rachel Gotleib, a compelling story about Peter Munk's Canadian stereo company. As part of an export initiative, The DX organized numerous programs that helped entrepreneurial Canadian Designers showcase their products in foreign markets including the UK, Hong Kong and Mexico. Moreover, the DX annual fundraising gala was created, which was named one of the top 10 fundraising galas in Toronto.\n\n[[File:Design Exchange June 2012.jpg|thumb|A gift shop at the Design Exchange, June 2012.
