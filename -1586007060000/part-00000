Eastman was an artist and [[West Point]] graduate who served in the US Army, first as a mapmaker and illustrator.  He had two tours at [[Fort Snelling]], [[Minnesota Territory]]; during the second, extended tour he was commanding officer of the fort. During these years, he painted many studies of Native American life. He was notable for the quality of his hundreds of illustrations for [[Henry Rowe Schoolcraft]]'s six-volume study on ''[[History of Indian Tribes of the United States]]'' (1851\u20131857), commissioned by the [[US Congress]].<ref>[https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/art/artifact/Painting_33_00018.htm#bio \"''West Point, New York'' by Seth Eastman\"], with bio, US Senate, accessed 29 September 2009</ref> From their time at [[Fort Snelling]], Mary Henderson Eastman wrote a book about [[Sioux#Linguistics|Dakota]] Sioux life and culture, which Seth Eastman illustrated. In 1838, he was elected into the [[National Academy of Design]] as an Honorary Academician.\n\nWhen the Eastmans were based in Washington, DC before the [[American Civil War]], Mary entered the literary \"lists\" and wrote the bestselling ''[[Aunt Phillis's Cabin|Aunt Phillis's Cabin: or, Southern Life As It Is]]'' (1852).  Defending slaveholders, she responded as a Southern [[Planter (American South)|planter]] to [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s anti-slavery work, ''Uncle Tom's Cabin.''  Mary Eastman's novel was one of the most widely read [[anti-Tom novel]]s and a commercial success, selling 20,000\u201330,000 copies.\n\nSeth Eastman retired as a Lieutenant Colonel and [[Brevet(militar)|Brevet]] [[Brigadier General]] for disability during the [[American Civil War]]. He was later reactivated when commissioned by Congress to make several paintings for the [[US Capitol]].  Between 1867 and 1869, Eastman painted a series of nine scenes of American Indian life for the House Committee on Indian Affairs.  In 1870 Congress commissioned Eastman to create a series of 17 paintings of important U.S. forts, to be hung in the meeting rooms of the [[House Committee on Military Affairs]].<ref name=\"senate\">[https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/art/common/slideshow/fortpaintings.htm \"Seth Eastman's Fort Paintings\"], Art and History, US Senate.

He persuaded his parents to let him go into the military.  Sixteen when he entered the [[West Point|United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point, New York]] in 1824, he graduated in 1829 to enter the Army as a second lieutenant in the 1st Infantry Regiment.<ref name=\"pbs.org\">[https://www.pbs.org/ktca/setheastman/setheastman.html Patricia Condon Johnston, \"Seth Eastman: The Soldier Artist\"], PBS, accessed 11 December 2008</ref><ref name = cmhbio>{{cite web| title = Seth Eastman| url = http://www.history.army.mil/html/artphoto/pripos/eastman/artist.html| publisher = [[United States Army Center of Military History]] | accessdate = June 16, 2010| date = December 1, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:fort knox maine painting.jpg|thumb|left|Painting of [[Fort Knox, Maine]].]]\nEastman made his career with the [[U.S. Army]].  He became an accomplished artist and used his skills in early mapmaking and recording Army activities.  In 1830 he was assigned to [[Fort Snelling]] near what became [[Minneapolis]] in present-day [[Minnesota]]. A large installation with 20 officers and up to 300 enlisted men, the fort was deep in [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] territory on the upper [[Mississippi River]].  While stationed there for three years, Eastman learned the [[Sioux language]] and captured many scenes of American Indian life in the territory. He painted and sketched prolifically.\n\nFrom 1833 to 1840, Eastman was assigned to West Point, where he taught drawing (used for mapmaking).<ref name = cmhbio/>  In 1841 Eastman was appointed commander of Fort Snelling and returned to Minnesota.  While stationed there for several years with his second wife and growing family, he continued to study and paint Native American life.  Their son Frank was born in 1844, daughter  Virginia in 1847, and son John McC. in 1849.<ref name=\"U.S. Census 1870\">[U.S. Census 1870]</ref> He learned much about the [[Sioux#Linguistics|Dakota]] culture particularly. He painted and drew pictures of the Sioux villages of ''[[Kaposia]]'' and [[Little Crow]], as well as settlements in present-day [[Scott County, Minnesota|Scott]], [[Wabasha County|Wabasha]], and [[Winona County|Winona]] counties.<ref>[http://www.mnhs.org/library/tips/history_topics/134eastman.htm \"Seth Eastman\"], ''Library: History Topics'', Minnesota Historical Society, 2011, accessed 3 February 2011</ref>\n\nHearing that Congress had authorized a study of Indians by the explorer and former US [[Indian agent]] [[Henry Rowe Schoolcraft]], Eastman asked to be assigned as illustrator.  Finally in 1849 at age 41, he had the chance. Captain Eastman and his family settled in Washington, where their son Harry was born in 1854.<ref name=\"U.S. Census 1870\"/>\n\nEastman began to work on what would be hundreds of pictures to illustrate the massive Schoolcraft study, published in six volumes from 1851\u20131857.<ref name=\"pbs.org\"/>  \n<blockquote>It was a monumental work that for Eastman consumed five years. During that time, he completed some 275 pages of illustrations to accompany Schoolcraft's six-volume ''Information Regarding the History, Conditions, and Prospects of the Indian Tribes of the United States''. When Volume I came off the press in early 1851, Eastman could take just pride in his accomplishment. His precise and exquisitely executed illustrations of Indian life, painted almost entirely from his frontier sketches, proved that he was singularly the best-qualified person in the country to undertake this epic work.<ref name=\"pbs.org\"/></blockquote>\n\nEastman's work, which complements the work of Hudson River School landscape painters of his era, illustrates how images of the landscape supported and extended the United States' work of empire building.  That is, the images of Americans' possession and domination of the landscape supported their mission of empire.  Eastman's images recorded the empire's reach into the northwest and helped spur it on.  In this regard, Eastman was working on a similar mission to the landscape painters who were working from private commissions.<ref>[http://blurblawg.typepad.com/files/property_progress_landscape_art.pdf Alfred L. Brophy, \"Property and Progress: Antebellum Landscape Art and Property,\" McGeorge Law Review 40 (2009) 601-59.]</ref>\nNear the end of his career, at the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, Eastman was commissioned by the House Committee on Military Affairs to paint pictures of seventeen important forts.  He completed these paintings between 1870 and 1875.  One controversial painting was ''[[Death Whoop]]'', which was twice removed from display because of negative comments from viewers, as it portrayed an Indian's scalping a white man. In the 1930s the paintings were displayed again in the [[United States Capitol|Capitol Building]].\n\n===Works===\n* Seth Eastman, ''Treatise on Topographical Drawing'', New York: Wiley and Putnam, 1837. His textbook on the techniques of map-making and map-reading was made mandatory for all topography classes at West Point.  Eastman created symbols for use on all maps, and explained how to draw height, width, and depth on a two-dimensional sheet of paper.\n* Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, ''Historical and Statistical Information Regarding the History, Conditions, and Prospects of the Indian Tribes of the United States'' (six volumes), Illustrated by Seth Eastman, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: [[J.

He recounted his life in the military, his art, his second wife Mary and their children. He did not mention his first wife Stand Sacred, daughter of a Dakota chief, or their daughter ''Winona,'' whom he left when reassigned.\n\n==Marriage and family==\nDuring his first posting at [[Fort Snelling]] near what is now [[Minneapolis]], Seth Eastman in 1830<ref name=Ruoff>[http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&type=summary&url=/journals/studies_in_american_indian_literatures/v017/17.2ruoff.html A.

Eastman was reassigned from Fort Snelling in 1832, soon after the birth of their daughter ''Winona'' (meaning First-born daughter). He declared his marriage ended when he was reassigned, as was typical of many European-American men who abandoned Indian women and their children. His daughter Winona was also called Mary Nancy Eastman. Later she was named ''Wakantakawin'' in the Sioux tradition of marking life passages.<ref name=Ruoff/>\n[[File:Charles eastman smithsonian gn 03462a.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Dr. [[Charles Eastman]].]]\nShe married a Santee Sioux and had five children, dying at the birth of the youngest, later known as Charles.  After adopting Christianity, her husband and two of their surviving sons took the Eastman surname. Winona's eldest son Rev. John (''Marpiyawaku Kida'') Eastman became a [[Presbyterian]] missionary at [[Flandreau, South Dakota]].  Her second son Dr. [[Charles Eastman]] was the first Native American certified as a medical doctor, after earning his degree at [[Boston University]].

Eastman was an artist and [[West Point]] graduate who served in the US Army, first as a mapmaker and illustrator.  He had two tours at [[Fort Snelling]], [[Minnesota Territory]]; during the second, extended tour he was commanding officer of the fort. During these years, he painted many studies of Native American life. He was notable for the quality of his hundreds of illustrations for [[Henry Rowe Schoolcraft]]'s six-volume study on ''[[History of Indian Tribes of the United States]]'' (1851\u20131857), commissioned by the [[US Congress]].<ref>[https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/art/artifact/Painting_33_00018.htm#bio \"''West Point, New York'' by Seth Eastman\"], with bio, US Senate, accessed 29 September 2009</ref> From their time at [[Fort Snelling]], Mary Henderson Eastman wrote a book about [[Sioux#Linguistics|Dakota]] Sioux life and culture, which Seth Eastman illustrated. In 1838, he was elected into the [[National Academy of Design]] as an Honorary Academician.\n\nWhen the Eastmans were based in Washington, DC before the [[American Civil War]], Mary entered the literary \"lists\" and wrote the bestselling ''[[Aunt Phillis's Cabin|Aunt Phillis's Cabin: or, Southern Life As It Is]]'' (1852).  Defending slaveholders, she responded as a Southern [[Planter (American South)|planter]] to [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s anti-slavery work, ''Uncle Tom's Cabin.''  Mary Eastman's novel was one of the most widely read [[anti-Tom novel]]s and a commercial success, selling 20,000\u201330,000 copies.\n\nSeth Eastman retired as a Lieutenant Colonel and [[Brevet(militar)|Brevet]] [[Brigadier General]] for disability during the [[American Civil War]]. He was later reactivated when commissioned by Congress to make several paintings for the [[US Capitol]].  Between 1867 and 1869, Eastman painted a series of nine scenes of American Indian life for the House Committee on Indian Affairs.  In 1870 Congress commissioned Eastman to create a series of 17 paintings of important U.S. forts, to be hung in the meeting rooms of the [[House Committee on Military Affairs]].<ref name=\"senate\">[https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/art/common/slideshow/fortpaintings.htm \"Seth Eastman's Fort Paintings\"], Art and History, US Senate.

He persuaded his parents to let him go into the military.  Sixteen when he entered the [[West Point|United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point, New York]] in 1824, he graduated in 1829 to enter the Army as a second lieutenant in the 1st Infantry Regiment.<ref name=\"pbs.org\">[https://www.pbs.org/ktca/setheastman/setheastman.html Patricia Condon Johnston, \"Seth Eastman: The Soldier Artist\"], PBS, accessed 11 December 2008</ref><ref name = cmhbio>{{cite web| title = Seth Eastman| url = http://www.history.army.mil/html/artphoto/pripos/eastman/artist.html| publisher = [[United States Army Center of Military History]] | accessdate = June 16, 2010| date = December 1, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:fort knox maine painting.jpg|thumb|left|Painting of [[Fort Knox, Maine]].]]\nEastman made his career with the [[U.S. Army]].  He became an accomplished artist and used his skills in early mapmaking and recording Army activities.  In 1830 he was assigned to [[Fort Snelling]] near what became [[Minneapolis]] in present-day [[Minnesota]]. A large installation with 20 officers and up to 300 enlisted men, the fort was deep in [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] territory on the upper [[Mississippi River]].  While stationed there for three years, Eastman learned the [[Sioux language]] and captured many scenes of American Indian life in the territory. He painted and sketched prolifically.\n\nFrom 1833 to 1840, Eastman was assigned to West Point, where he taught drawing (used for mapmaking).<ref name = cmhbio/>  In 1841 Eastman was appointed commander of Fort Snelling and returned to Minnesota.  While stationed there for several years with his second wife and growing family, he continued to study and paint Native American life.  Their son Frank was born in 1844, daughter  Virginia in 1847, and son John McC. in 1849.<ref name=\"U.S. Census 1870\">[U.S. Census 1870]</ref> He learned much about the [[Sioux#Linguistics|Dakota]] culture particularly. He painted and drew pictures of the Sioux villages of ''[[Kaposia]]'' and [[Little Crow]], as well as settlements in present-day [[Scott County, Minnesota|Scott]], [[Wabasha County|Wabasha]], and [[Winona County|Winona]] counties.<ref>[http://www.mnhs.org/library/tips/history_topics/134eastman.htm \"Seth Eastman\"], ''Library: History Topics'', Minnesota Historical Society, 2011, accessed 3 February 2011</ref>\n\nHearing that Congress had authorized a study of Indians by the explorer and former US [[Indian agent]] [[Henry Rowe Schoolcraft]], Eastman asked to be assigned as illustrator.  Finally in 1849 at age 41, he had the chance. Captain Eastman and his family settled in Washington, where their son Harry was born in 1854.<ref name=\"U.S. Census 1870\"/>\n\nEastman began to work on what would be hundreds of pictures to illustrate the massive Schoolcraft study, published in six volumes from 1851\u20131857.<ref name=\"pbs.org\"/>  \n<blockquote>It was a monumental work that for Eastman consumed five years. During that time, he completed some 275 pages of illustrations to accompany Schoolcraft's six-volume ''Information Regarding the History, Conditions, and Prospects of the Indian Tribes of the United States''. When Volume I came off the press in early 1851, Eastman could take just pride in his accomplishment. His precise and exquisitely executed illustrations of Indian life, painted almost entirely from his frontier sketches, proved that he was singularly the best-qualified person in the country to undertake this epic work.<ref name=\"pbs.org\"/></blockquote>\n\nEastman's work, which complements the work of Hudson River School landscape painters of his era, illustrates how images of the landscape supported and extended the United States' work of empire building.  That is, the images of Americans' possession and domination of the landscape supported their mission of empire.  Eastman's images recorded the empire's reach into the northwest and helped spur it on.  In this regard, Eastman was working on a similar mission to the landscape painters who were working from private commissions.<ref>[http://blurblawg.typepad.com/files/property_progress_landscape_art.pdf Alfred L. Brophy, \"Property and Progress: Antebellum Landscape Art and Property,\" McGeorge Law Review 40 (2009) 601-59.]</ref>\nNear the end of his career, at the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, Eastman was commissioned by the House Committee on Military Affairs to paint pictures of seventeen important forts.  He completed these paintings between 1870 and 1875.  One controversial painting was ''[[Death Whoop]]'', which was twice removed from display because of negative comments from viewers, as it portrayed an Indian's scalping a white man. In the 1930s the paintings were displayed again in the [[United States Capitol|Capitol Building]].\n\n===Works===\n* Seth Eastman, ''Treatise on Topographical Drawing'', New York: Wiley and Putnam, 1837. His textbook on the techniques of map-making and map-reading was made mandatory for all topography classes at West Point.  Eastman created symbols for use on all maps, and explained how to draw height, width, and depth on a two-dimensional sheet of paper.\n* Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, ''Historical and Statistical Information Regarding the History, Conditions, and Prospects of the Indian Tribes of the United States'' (six volumes), Illustrated by Seth Eastman, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: [[J.

Eastman was reassigned from Fort Snelling in 1832, soon after the birth of their daughter ''Winona'' (meaning First-born daughter). He declared his marriage ended when he was reassigned, as was typical of many European-American men who abandoned Indian women and their children. His daughter Winona was also called Mary Nancy Eastman. Later she was named ''Wakantakawin'' in the Sioux tradition of marking life passages.<ref name=Ruoff/>\n[[File:Charles eastman smithsonian gn 03462a.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Dr. [[Charles Eastman]].]]\nShe married a Santee Sioux and had five children, dying at the birth of the youngest, later known as Charles.  After adopting Christianity, her husband and two of their surviving sons took the Eastman surname. Winona's eldest son Rev. John (''Marpiyawaku Kida'') Eastman became a [[Presbyterian]] missionary at [[Flandreau, South Dakota]].  Her second son Dr. [[Charles Eastman]] was the first Native American certified as a medical doctor, after earning his degree at [[Boston University]].

They date from the middle of the twelfth century and are the surviving elements of the [[mosque]] of Bahramshah. Their sides are decorated with intricate geometric patterns. Some of the upper sections of the minarets have been damaged or destroyed. The most important [[mausoleum]] located in Ghazni City is that of [[Mahmud of Ghazni|Sultan Mahmud]]. Others include the Tombs of poets and scientists, such as the Tomb of [[Al Biruni]]. The only ruins in Old Ghazni retaining a semblance of architectural form are two towers, about 43&nbsp;m (140&nbsp;ft) high and 365 m (1,200&nbsp;ft) apart. According to inscriptions, the towers were constructed by Mahmud of Ghazni and his son. For more than eight centuries the \u201cTowers of Victory\u201d monuments to Afghanistan's greatest empire have survived wars and invasions, the two toffee-colored minarets, adorned with terra-cotta tiles were raised in the early 12th century as monuments to the victories of the Afghan armies that built the empire.

They date from the middle of the twelfth century and are the surviving elements of the [[mosque]] of Bahramshah. Their sides are decorated with intricate geometric patterns. Some of the upper sections of the minarets have been damaged or destroyed. The most important [[mausoleum]] located in Ghazni City is that of [[Mahmud of Ghazni|Sultan Mahmud]]. Others include the Tombs of poets and scientists, such as the Tomb of [[Al Biruni]]. The only ruins in Old Ghazni retaining a semblance of architectural form are two towers, about 43&nbsp;m (140&nbsp;ft) high and 365 m (1,200&nbsp;ft) apart. According to inscriptions, the towers were constructed by Mahmud of Ghazni and his son. For more than eight centuries the \u201cTowers of Victory\u201d monuments to Afghanistan's greatest empire have survived wars and invasions, the two toffee-colored minarets, adorned with terra-cotta tiles were raised in the early 12th century as monuments to the victories of the Afghan armies that built the empire. By the time the Ghurids had finalized the Ghaznavid removal from Ghazni, the city was a cultural center of the eastern Islamic world.<ref>C.E.
