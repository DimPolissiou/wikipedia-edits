While out in the city of [[Saratov]], the two are approached by a man named Nikolai (Nikita Bogolyubov) who asks them to come to his apartment to teach him and a friend about their faith. When the Elders arrive the next day, Nikolai and another man named Sergei (Alex Veadov) beat them, tie them up, and kidnap them. They drive to a remote location where the missionaries are handcuffed to a pipe, held at gunpoint, and photographed. The kidnappers demand a ransom of $300,000. Propst and Tuttle's families are informed of their sons' kidnapping; Propst's father receives a call from Senator [[Gordon H. Smith]] ([[Bart Johnson]]), who informs him that he is doing everything he can to resolve the issue.\n\nMeanwhile, in Russia, Elders Propst and Tuttle spend five days in captivity. Propst is convinced that Nikolai will have compassion on them and eventually let them go, so he asks him for small favors, like food, a bathroom, and being moved to a more comfortable position - all of which Nikolai grants. Sergei is less kind; he grows impatient that the ransom money still hasn't been paid, and has the Elders write their families, in hopes that it will speed things up. Back in the U.S., news of the kidnappings spreads nationwide, and people of many faiths begin to pray for the two hostages. The Propst family receives an anonymous check for the demanded $300,000, but ultimately decide not to pay it, as it would encourage the kidnapping of more missionaries for easy money. The Tuttle family receives a call from Mark Larsen, who was kidnapped as a missionary in Argentina years earlier. Larsen explains that with time, the Elders will develop more hope and faith and start to show compassion to their captors.\n\nThis proves to be true; Propst manages to remove his handcuffs and devises a plan with Tuttle to escape, but the two then remember their purpose as a missionaries and put their cuffs back on instead of fighting their way out of captivity. Nikolai then confides in the Elders, confessing his guilt for kidnapping them; he explains that his girlfriend is pregnant, and he helped Sergei kidnap \"rich Christians\" so that he would have money to provide for a family. The Elders ask about a tattoo on Sergei's hand, which Nikolai tells them came from his days as a Russian Naval hero and means \"forever loyal.\"\n\nThe next morning, Sergei announces that their time is up, and drives Tuttle and Propst to a snowy field. As Sergei prepares to kill them, he notices that the missionaries have drawn markings on their hands similar to his tattoo, giving him pause. He and Nikolai drive away, leaving Tuttle and Propst to run away and find their way back to Saratov. Their families are informed that they have been freed, and that Nikolai and Sergei have been arrested by Russian officials. Propst and Tuttle speak over the phone to their families, and finish their missions elsewhere in Europe.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Corbin Allred]] as Elder Tuttle\n* Maclain Nelson as Elder Propst\n* Nikita Bogolyubov as Nikolai\n* [[Alex Veadov]] as Sergei\n* [[Bart Johnson]] as Senator [[Gordon H. Smith]]\n\n== Production ==\nDirector [[Garrett Batty]] had wanted to make a film about the kidnapping of the [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Church]] missionaries ever since he first heard their story in the news. Years later, he contacted Propst and Tuttle with the intention of making a movie about their experiences in Russia; the two were skeptical at first, but met with Batty and shared their story. Batty wrote the script after his conversation with Propst and Tuttle, balancing the actual events with his own artistic vision for the film. Production hit multiple snags: Batty underwent [[Cardiac surgery|heart surgery]] shortly after his meeting with Propst and Tuttle, and financial backing took a while to manifest.<ref name=\":2\" /> The outdoor scenes set in Russia were filmed in [[Estonia]], and the scenes of the missionaries' captivity and their families back home were filmed in [[Utah|Utah, U.S.A]].<ref name=\"trib\" />\n\nBatty wrote, directed, and produced the film, along with producers Maclain Nelson, Jonathan T.

While out in the city of [[Saratov]], the two are approached by a man named Nikolai (Nikita Bogolyubov) who asks them to come to his apartment to teach him and a friend about their faith. When the Elders arrive the next day, Nikolai and another man named Sergei (Alex Veadov) beat them, tie them up, and kidnap them. They drive to a remote location where the missionaries are handcuffed to a pipe, held at gunpoint, and photographed. The kidnappers demand a ransom of $300,000. Propst and Tuttle's families are informed of their sons' kidnapping; Propst's father receives a call from Senator [[Gordon H. Smith]] ([[Bart Johnson]]), who informs him that he is doing everything he can to resolve the issue.\n\nMeanwhile in Russia, Elders Propst and Tuttle spend five days in captivity. Propst is convinced that Nikolai will have compassion on them and eventually let them go, so he asks him for small favors, like food, a bathroom, and being moved to a more comfortable position - all of which Nikolai grants. Sergei is less kind; he grows impatient that the ransom money still hasn't been paid, and has the Elders write their families, in hopes that it will speed things up. Back in the U.S., news of the kidnappings spreads nationwide, and people of many faiths begin to pray for the two hostages. The Propst family receives an anonymous check for the demanded $300,000, but ultimately decide not to pay it, as it would encourage the kidnapping of more missionaries for easy money. The Tuttle family receives a call from Mark Larsen, who was kidnapped as a missionary in Argentina years earlier. Larsen explains that with time, the Elders will develop more hope and faith and start to show compassion to their captors. \n\nThis proves to be true; Propst manages to remove his handcuffs and devises a plan with Tuttle to escape, but the two then remember their purpose as a missionaries and put their cuffs back on instead of fighting their way out of captivity. Nikolai then confides in the Elders, confessing his guilt for kidnapping them; he explains that his girlfriend is pregnant, and he helped Sergei kidnap \"rich Christians\" so that he would have money to provide for a family. The Elders ask about a tattoo on Sergei's hand, which Nikolai tells them came from his days as a Russian Naval hero and means \"forever loyal.\"\n\nThe next morning, Sergei announces that their time is up, and drives Tuttle and Propst to a snowy field. As Sergei prepares to kill them, he notices that the missionaries have drawn markings on their hands similar to his tattoo, giving him pause. He and Nikolai drive away, leaving Tuttle and Propst to run away and find their way back to Saratov. Their families are informed that they have been freed, and that Nikolai and Sergei have been arrested by Russian officials. Propst and Tuttle speak over the phone to their families, and finish their missions elsewhere in Europe.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Corbin Allred]] as Elder Tuttle\n* Maclain Nelson as Elder Propst\n* Nikita Bogolyubov as Nikolai\n* [[Alex Veadov]] as Sergei\n* [[Bart Johnson]] as Senator [[Gordon H. Smith]]\n\n== Production ==\nDirector [[Garrett Batty]] had wanted to make a film about the kidnapping of the [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Church]] missionaries ever since he first heard their story in the news. Years later, he contacted Propst and Tuttle with the intention of making a movie about their experiences in Russia; the two were skeptical at first, but met with Batty and shared their story. Batty wrote the script after his conversation with Propst and Tuttle, balancing the actual events with his own artistic vision for the film. Production hit multiple snags: Batty underwent [[Cardiac surgery|heart surgery]] shortly after his meeting with Propst and Tuttle, and financial backing took a while to manifest.<ref name=\":2\" /> The outdoor scenes set in Russia were filmed in [[Estonia]], and the scenes of the missionaries' captivity and their families back home were filmed in [[Utah|Utah, U.S.A]].<ref name=\"trib\" />\n\nBatty wrote, directed, and produced the film, along with producers Maclain Nelson, Jonathan T.

These features guarantee high reliability and safety, even under the most extreme environmental conditions.\n\nThe KBA offers a wide range of firing modes: single shot; programmable rapid single shot with a rate of fire of up to 200 rds/min; and full automatic fire of 600 rds/ min. The cannon functions, such as cocking and firing, are electrically actuated by remote control unit or in auxiliary mode mechanically by a hand crank and a trigger pedal.\n\nThe Oerlikon KBA 25mm cannon has been designed for integration in various types of mounts, small size and low weight offer various integration possibilities such as: \n* Manned (1 or 2 operators) or remote controlled turrets on IFVs, APCs\n* Air defence gun mounts\n* Naval mounts\n* Helicopter mounts\n\nThe various types of available ammunition combined with the unique Instant Ammunition Selection Device (IASD) and different selectable firing modes with a rate of fire up to 600rds/min support any type of operational use.\n\n== History ==\nIn 1964 the American company [[TRW Inc.]] was entrusted with the development of a 25&nbsp;mm weapon while Oerlikon-Buehrle Machine Tool Works assumed responsibility for developing the ammunition and interior ballistics for it.\n\nBoth were intended to meet the requirements for the armament of [[infantry fighting vehicle]]s of the 80's and 90's: \n* Ammunition performance: 25&nbsp;mm armour steel, 60\u00b0 (NATO) angle of impact, 1000m range, corresponding to the armour of a well-armoured infantry fighting vehicle.\n* \"Instant ammunition selection\" for engagement of different targets\n* Selectable firing mode: Accurate single shot, bursts with a rate of fire of more than 550 rds/min for engagement of aircraft\n* Compact structure: with low weight for installation in gun turrets of APC's\n* Simple to operate: and service in the hands of infantry\n\nThree years later, at the beginning of 1967, technical tests and firing trials were carried out with the first two American prototype (recoil operated) cannons (TRW-6425)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bevfitchett.us/machine-gun-v5/mm-trw-automatic-cannon.html|title=Mm Trw Automatic Cannon - Machine Gun V5|website=www.bevfitchett.us|access-date=2017-03-30}}</ref> at Oerlikon-Buehrle Machine Tool Works followed by the first demonstrations for another NATO country.\n\nIn the trials, however, the American prototypes displayed a number of basic functional deficiencies. This persuaded Oerlikon-Buehrle Machine Tool Works to undertake their own development work to effect system modifications, which then resulted in the required functional reliability and enabled the trials to be completed successfully. (1970, 10 gas-operated cannons). When the first prototype cannons became available, suitable gun turrets had also to be provided. In 1967 an agreement was signed between Machine Tool Works Oerlikon-Buehrle and a well-known and established sub-contractor, to collaborate in the development and manufacture of 25&nbsp;mm gun turrets. These gun turrets were in the first instance to be suitable for mounting on [[M113 armoured personnel carrier]] C&R of a NATO country's army. \nThe complete system, cannon, hand-driven turret and ammunition underwent detailed firing trials between 1969 and 1971. Special new development efforts were devoted to improve functional reliability, durability and firing precision, and in 1971 sufficient progress had been made for the weapon system to fulfil the strict specifications laid down, and to be delivered to the Netherlands.\n\nWithin the framework of the product support service Oerlikon improves the product and adapts it regularly to the latest requirements. An important step forward was made in 1982/83 when the ammunition penetration performance range of the 25&nbsp;mm APDS-T (sub-caliber) round was increased 150% from 1000 to 2500 m.\n\nThe wide range of strong points of the Oerlikon KBA 25&nbsp;mm cannon, such as high rate of fire, ammunition performance, good safety record, dual belt feeder with first-round response, no external power requirement and simple maintenance lead to a considerably increasing interest in the Oerlikon KBA 25&nbsp;mm cannon in years.\n\n== Ammunition ==\nA wide range of ammunition has been developed for this weapon specifically developed to engage and defeat both ground and air targets.\n\nThe ammunition complies with all handling and operational safety requirements according to MIL-STD\u2019s, and was subjected to intensive trials by NATO member countries prior to its introduction and standardization as NATO 25mmx137 ammunition.\n[[File:US Navy 090129-N-4774B-008 Gunner's Mate 2nd Class Nicholas Brassard

originally made by Oerlikon Contraves AG (renamed as [[Rheinmetall Air Defence]] AG following the merger with [[Rheinmetall]] in 2009).\n\nThe Oerlikon KBA is a gas operated selective fire weapon taking a 25&nbsp;mm cartridge from a dual selective belt feed and firing at a rate of 600 rounds per minute, it has been developed as a close-range multipurpose weapon for the modern battlefield.\n\nDue to its firepower, various types of ammunition and its \"Instant Ammunition Selection Device\" (IASD), the KBA can engage lightly armoured vehicles, infantry and anti-tank positions, helicopters, combat aircraft and ships.\n\n== Description ==\nThe Oerlikon KBA 25&nbsp;mm cannon is a fully automatic, positively locked, gas-operated weapon with a rotating bolt head and double belt feed. These features guarantee high reliability and safety, even under the most extreme environmental conditions.\n\nThe KBA offers a wide range of firing modes: single shot; programmable rapid single shot with a rate of fire of up to 200 rds/min; and full automatic fire of 600 rds/ min. The cannon functions, such as cocking and firing, are electrically actuated by remote control unit or in auxiliary mode mechanically by a hand crank and a trigger pedal.\n\nThe Oerlikon KBA 25mm cannon has been designed for integration in various types of mounts, small size and low weight offer various integration possibilities such as: \n* Manned (1 or 2 operators) or remote controlled turrets on IFVs, APCs\n* Air defence gun mounts\n* Naval mounts\n* Helicopter mounts\n\nThe various types of available ammunition combined with the unique Instant Ammunition Selection Device (IASD) and different selectable firing modes with a rate of fire up to 600rds/min support any type of operational use.\n\n== History ==\nIn 1964 the American company [[TRW Inc.]] was entrusted with the development of a 25&nbsp;mm weapon while Oerlikon-Buehrle Machine Tool Works assumed responsibility for developing the ammunition and interior ballistics for it.\n\nBoth were intended to meet the requirements for the armament of [[infantry fighting vehicle]]s of the 80's and 90's: \n* Ammunition performance: 25&nbsp;mm armour steel, 60\u00b0 (NATO) angle of impact, 1000m range, corresponding to the armour of a well-armoured infantry fighting vehicle.\n* \"Instant ammunition selection\" for engagement of different targets\n* Selectable firing mode: Accurate single shot, bursts with a rate of fire of more than 550 rds/min for engagement of aircraft\n* Compact structure: with low weight for installation in gun turrets of APC's\n* Simple to operate: and service in the hands of infantry\n\nThree years later, at the beginning of 1967, technical tests and firing trials were carried out with the first two American prototype (recoil operated) cannons (TRW-6425)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bevfitchett.us/machine-gun-v5/mm-trw-automatic-cannon.html|title=Mm Trw Automatic Cannon - Machine Gun V5|website=www.bevfitchett.us|access-date=2017-03-30}}</ref> at Oerlikon-Buehrle Machine Tool Works followed by the first demonstrations for another NATO country.\n\nIn the trials, however, the American prototypes displayed a number of basic functional deficiencies. This persuaded Oerlikon-Buehrle Machine Tool Works to undertake their own development work to effect system modifications, which then resulted in the required functional reliability and enabled the trials to be completed successfully. (1970, 10 gas-operated cannons). When the first prototype cannons became available, suitable gun turrets had also to be provided. In 1967 an agreement was signed between Machine Tool Works Oerlikon-Buehrle and a well-known and established sub-contractor, to collaborate in the development and manufacture of 25&nbsp;mm gun turrets. These gun turrets were in the first instance to be suitable for mounting on [[M113 armoured personnel carrier]] C&R of a NATO country's army. \nThe complete system, cannon, hand-driven turret and ammunition underwent detailed firing trials between 1969 and 1971. Special new development efforts were devoted to improve functional reliability, durability and firing precision, and in 1971 sufficient progress had been made for the weapon system to fulfil the strict specifications laid down, and to be delivered to the Netherlands.\n\nWithin the framework of the product support service Oerlikon improves the product and adapts it regularly to the latest requirements. An important step forward was made in 1982/83 when the ammunition penetration performance range of the 25&nbsp;mm APDS-T (sub-caliber) round was increased 150% from 1000 to 2500 m.\n\nThe wide range of strong points of the Oerlikon KBA 25&nbsp;mm cannon, such as high rate of fire, ammunition performance, good safety record, dual belt feeder with first-round response, no external power requirement and simple maintenance lead to a considerably increasing interest in the Oerlikon KBA 25&nbsp;mm cannon in years.\n\n== Ammunition ==\nA wide range of ammunition has been developed for this weapon specifically developed to engage and defeat both ground and air targets.\n\nThe ammunition complies with all handling and operational safety requirements according to MIL-STD\u2019s, and was subjected to intensive trials by NATO member countries prior to its introduction and standardization as NATO 25mmx137 ammunition.\n[[File:US Navy 090129-N-4774B-008 Gunner's Mate 2nd Class Nicholas Brassard inspects rounds for the MK-38 25mm machine gun system.jpg|thumb|US Navy gunner inspects TP-T rounds]]\nThe current 25mm ammunition family consists of six combat and two training rounds:\n* [[Armour-piercing fin-stabilized discarding-sabot|APFSDS-T]]: armour-piercing fin stabilized discarding sabot with tracer, for use against armoured ground targets\n* [[Armour-piercing discarding sabot|APDS-T]]: armour-piercing discarding sabot with tracer, for use against armoured ground targets\n* FAPDS-T: frangible armour-piercing discarding sabot with tracer, for use against air, ground and urban targets\n* TPDS-T: target practice discarding sabot with tracer, a short range trainer for the above sub-calibre types\n* [[Semi-armor-piercing high-explosive incendiary|SAPHEI]]-T: semi-armour-piercing high explosive incendiary with tracer, for use against well protected targets\n* [[High-explosive incendiary|HEI]]-T: high explosive incendiary with tracer, for use against lightly protected targets\n* MP-T: multipurpose with tracer\n* TP-T: target practice with tracer, for training with the above full calibre types\n\n== Operators ==\n\n=== Current operators ===\n[[File:VBM Freccia visto frontalmente.JPG|thumb|Example of KBA gun installed on Italian 8x8 [[Freccia IFV|Freccia]] wheeled Infantry fighting vehicle in use with the Italian Army.]]\n*{{Flag|Bangladesh}}\n** [[Minerva-class corvette|Leader Class offshore patrol vessel]]\n** [[Sobuj Bangla-class patrol craft|''Sobuj Bangla''-class inshore patrol vessel]]\n* {{TUR}}\n** ASELSAN 25&nbsp;mm STOP Stabilized Naval Gun System<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.navyrecognition.com/index.php/news/defence-news/year-2015-news/july-2015-navy-naval-forces-defense-industry-technology-maritime-security-global-news/2935-aselsan-stop-25mm-remote-weapon-stations-for-pakistan-navy-fleet-tanker-project.html|title=Aselsan STOP 25mm Remote Weapon Stations for Pakistan Navy Fleet Tanker Project|work=Navy Recognition|access-date=2017-03-30|language=en-gb}}</ref>\n* {{Flag|Egypt}}\n* {{ITA}}\n** [[FREMM]] multipurpose frigate\n** [[Italian aircraft carrier Cavour|CVH 550 ''Cavour'']] aircraft carrier\n** [[Freccia IFV|VBM Freccia infantry fighting vehicle]]\n** [[SIDAM 25]] self-propelled anti-aircraft gun\n** [[Horizon-class frigate]]\n* {{Flag|Japan}}\n** [[Type 87 ARV]]\n* {{Flag|Netherlands}}\n* {{Flag|Chile}}\n* {{Flag|Romania}}\n** [[MLI-84]] tracked infantry fighting vehicle\n* {{Flag|Bahrain}}\n* {{Flag|Turkmenistan}}\n*{{Flag|Malta}}\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Oerlikon-Contraves]]\n[[Category:Autocannon]]\n", "name_user": "Stefranci", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oerlikon_KBA"}
