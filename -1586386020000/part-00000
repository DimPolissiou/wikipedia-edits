These missions occasionally provoked reactions, sometimes hostile, from behind the Iron Curtain. On April 8, 1950, Soviet [[Lavochkin La-11]] fighters shot down a Lyautey-based PB4Y-2 Privateer (BUNO 59645) over the Baltic Sea, off the coast of Liep\u0101ja, Latvia with the loss of all ten aircrew<ref name=\"StaHypo1\">{{Cite web|title = History Of VQ-2.

As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines. Having lost an aircraft and lives to hostile Soviet action, the aircrew appreciated the added takeoff and combat speed of the two [[Allison J33-A-10A]] turbojet engines mounted in the aft of the [[Pratt & Whitney R-4360-20A Wasp Major]] radial's nacelles<ref name=\"East\">East, Don C.</ref>. \n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A. By mid-1954, four P4M-1Qs and one [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune|Lockheed P2V-2 Neptune]] were at Lyautey. The P2V-2, stripped of ASW equipment, served as a trainer and logistics aircraft<ref name=\"StaHypo2\">{{Cite web|title = History Of VQ-2.

Regular deployment sites were [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik]], [[RAF Mildenhall|Mildehnall], [[Lucius D.

At commissioning, Commander Morris L. Kalin led a total complement of 24 officers and 78 enlisted men<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\n[[File:Martin P4M Mercator VQ-2 06.09.56.jpg|thumb|left|P4M-1Q Mercator of VQ-2 electronics reconnaissance squadron in September 1956 - note extra radar 'bulges' on this variant.]]\n[[File:P2V-5 NAS Jacksonville 1952.jpg|thumb|left|P2V-5 with nose turret in 1952. The Lyautey P2V-5Fs had additional turbojets mounted on nacelles where the rockets are in this photo.]]\nThe squadron continued using the six P4M-1Qs as mission aircraft. In addition, they obtained three Lockheed P2V-5Fs. The P2V-5Fs were reconfigured onsite from the standard maritime reconnaissance to similar electronic suites as the P-4Ms. Of note, the P2v-5Fs had the same dash speed capability as the P4Ms from two [[Westinghouse J34]]-WE-34 turbojets mounted on their own nacelles outboard the [[Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone|Wright R-3350-32W Cyclone Turbo-compound]] radials. The squadron used the P2V-3 for pilot training and logistics, since it was not configured for electronic reconnaissance (this became a standard squadron practice when possible; using a \"bare bones airframe of one of its models for training and logistics)<ref name=\"East\" />. The four Neptunes would serve alongside the Mercators until 1960.\n\nIn September 1956, a new and faster [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-capable]] [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A3D-1Q Skywarrior]] was delivered to the squadron. The A3D-1Q, nicknamed \"The Whale\" was a reconfigured A3D-1 with the bombay closed and an electronic reconnaissance suite installed similar to those of the P4M-1Q and P2V-5F<ref name=\"Francillon\">Francillon</ref><ref name=\"Heinemann\">Heinemann</ref><ref name=\"Gunston\">Gunston</ref>. The Whale was a carrier-capable high-wing, twin-jet aircraft with a crew of four<ref name= \"Winchester\">Winchester 2006, p. 75.</ref>. The A-3 was also one of the fastest non-afterburner aircraft in the US Armed Forces with a service ceiling significantly higher than the Mercators and Neptunes which gave the aircraft a greater area of coverage<ref name=\"East\"/>. The squadron also received an A3D-1 which it use like the P2V-3<ref name=\"East\" />. Although the pilots and navigators came to the command after carrier-qualifying, the squadron operated the A-3 from land bases until the next decade unlike her sister squadron VQ-1<ref name=\"Hypo2\" /><ref name=\"East\" />. With the high tempo of operations and depot-level maintenance for the three models back in the continental United States (CONUS), it is unsurprising that on 1 June 1957, the command had three P4M-1Q,, two A3D-1Q, two P2V-5F, one A3D-1, and one P2V-3 reported in its table of organization (TOE)<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\nThe [[1958 Lebanon crisis|Lebanon Crisis in 1958]] on 15 July 1958, saw a p4M-1Q and aircrew shift south from Incirlik to fly out of Beirut while the US Marines and US Army were deployed there at the behest of [[Camille Chamoun]], the President. VQ-2 operated out of [[Beirut Airport]] through the remainder of the summer and into the fall, departing with the withdrawal of US forces after stabilization in October 1958.\n\n===Homeport Change===\n\nAs a result of the Pact of Madrid, signed on 23 September 1953 by [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and the [[United States]], the US pledged  to furnish [[foreign aid|economic]] and [[military aid]] to Spain. The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\nThe relocation of the squadron to Rota began in late 1958 into the first days of 1959. The shift of the squadron CO, XO, and department heads (DHs) was completed by 14 January 1959, but it would take another year to transfer all command assets to Rota<ref name=\"East\" />. All assets at Lyautey had to be surveyed, packed up, and moved. \n\nDuring this evolution, five seven-seat A3D-2Q aircraft arrived to replace the four-seat A3D-1Qs. These new aircraft had the bulkhead between the  cockpit and the bomb bay removed, the bomb bay sealed, and three more seats and equipment added in the former bay.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"East\" />. This unarmed version (the tail gun had been removed<ref name=\"Francillon\" />) brought an increase in capability to the community.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the eleven aircrew fatalities and three aircraft in three mishaps:\n# On 6 January 1958, at the end of a ferry flight from Port Lyautey, via Lajes, Azores and Bermuda to [[NAS Norfolk]], Virginia, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124373)<ref name='VPNavy'>{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Mishaps|url =https://www.vpnavy.com/vq2_mishap.html|website = www.vpnavy.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> lost an engine on approach.

All four aircrew aboard were killed.\n\n==1960s==\n\n===Change===\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. On 14 January 1960, with all equipment and personnel out of Lyautey, VQ-2 officially transferred to Naval Station. \n\nThe Navy had recognized that the maintenance costs of the aging, worn P4M-1Q and P2V-5F airframes were increasingly more expensive to maintain, and these planes needed replacement. Washington opted for a larger, more capable aircraft, the [[EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. The \"Willie Victors,\" unarmed like the A3D-2Qs<ref name=\":0\" />, could carry a crew of twenty-six. On 26 February 1960, the first two WV-2Q arrived. By the end of the first quarter in 1960, 31 March, VQ-2'aircraft inventory were five A3D-2Q, three P2V-5F, two P4M-1Q, and two WV-2Q. The P2V-5F and P4M-1Q aircraft were soon to be phased out as all hands quickly adapted to the A3D-2Q and WV-2Q airframes. Meanwhile, the\u00b7squadron continued its business of airborne electronic reconnaissance. By the summer of 1960, the Mercators and Neptunes were gone.\n\nOn 18 September 1962, the Department of Defense (DoD) initiated its Tri-Service Aircraft Designation System which replaced the 1922 USN Aircraft Designation System. The new unified system for designating all US military aircraft was a ''Type/Model/Series'' (T/M/S).<ref name=\"TMS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.designation-systems.info/usmilav/aircraft.html|title=Current Designations of U.S. Military Aircraft|website = www.designation-systems.info|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref>. With this change, the A3D-2Q became the EA-3B and the WV-2Q became the EC-121M<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\n===In Theater Operations===\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs with A3D-2Qs filling in as needed<ref name=\":0\" />. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nFollowing the Cuban Missile Crisis was [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant<ref name=\"East\"/>. Afterwards, a series of eastern Mediterranean crises provided ample opportunities for VQ-2 to perform timely reconnaissance<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />. A major factor in the more direct tactical reconnaissance shipboard role was the rapidly growing and modernizing Soviet Navy that established a continuous presence in the Mediterranean, concurrent with the Cyprus Crisis. In response to these crises, VQ-2 started operating EA-3B detachments aboard a Mediterranean-based carriers like her sister squadron, VQ-1 did in the Pacific. In January of 1965, the first planes went aboard the [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS Saratoga (CVA-60)]]. Detachments aboardupport to the Mediterranean deployed carriers.\n\nWhile operating in Vietnam and the Philippines, the political tensions in the Middle East and North Africa were building. In June of 1967, armed conflict erupted into the [[Six-Day War]] where Israel defeated its enemies. The loss of the [[USS Liberty]] during the war at the hands of the IDF reaffirmed the relative safety of using aircraft for fleet reconnaissance<ref name=\"East\" />. This incident kept the high tempo of operations in the Eastern Mediterranean despite a cessation of strife in Cyprus. The coup in Libya in 1969 combined with the ever increasing presence of the Soviet Navy to counter the presence of the NATO navies in the Mediterranean kept the command operating at a high tempo.\n\nAs the decade came to a close, VQ-2 found itself operating all over Europe from various NATO bases, from US Sixth Fleet carriers, as well as in Southeast Asia.\n\n===Cuban Missile Crisis===\n\nIn October 1962 the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] developed. Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in CONUS<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />, VQ-2 deployed a number of EA-3B and an EC-121M aircraft to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba. After this major superpower crisis was defused, the assets returned to Spain. The squadron's rapidity and flexibility demonstrated in Florida<ref name=\"VQH\" /> kept it very busy when it returned to Europe where it resumed missions in the Mediterranean, Baltic, and central Europe. \n===Vietnam===\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown by EA-3Bs and EC-121Ms into the theater to support US Navy combat operations in Vietnam. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam in 1966, VQ-2 EA-3Bs joined them operating almost exclusively from there as VQ-2 DET BRAVO<ref name=\"East\" />. From both locations, VQ-2 aircraft provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]<ref name=\"East\" />. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the fifty-two aircrew fatalities and five aircraft in seven mishaps.\n# Two days after the official move, on 16 January 1960, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124365) crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]]. The crew had been flying in to relieve the detachment that had been operating there<ref name=\":0\" />.

Just as the crew chief was getting ready to go, the pilot got a restart and recovered out of the spin. The aircraft with the pilot, navigator and crew chief made it back to DET ALFA. The other four perished with only one body recovered and the personal effects of the other three.<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /><ref name=\"StaHypo\" />\n# On 3 November 1966, an EA-3B (BUNO 146458)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> struck the water aft of the ship inbound to a night recovery on the [[USS Independence (CV-62)|USS Independence (CVA-62)]] in the central Mediterranean off [[Sicily]].

DET BRAVO shipped the airframe to CONUS for repairs via sealift. In rough weather in Tokyo Bay on 14 December 1968, the plane broke loose from its tie downs and was lost overboard.\n\n==1970s==\n\n===Continued Change===\n[[File:EP-3E Orion of VQ-2 parked c1971.jpg|thumb|EP-3E Aries of VQ-2 parked in 1971]]\nIn the second decade of the squadron's forward basing in Spain, the American presence in Rota saw the relocation of the destroyer squadron that had been based in Athens arrive just as the submarine squadron returned to CONUS. <ref name=\"East\"/> The greater availability of assignments at the Aviation Intermediate Maintenance Depot (AIMD) across the hangar fro the squadron saw an increase in \"homesteading\" (remaining at one location as long as one's career would allow) by enlisted personnel as the rate of intermarriage with Spanish host nationals increased.\n\nThe EC-121Ms' career in the command had been a second lease on life since the airframes when acquired by VQ-2On 31 July 1971 were over ten years old<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"VQH\" />. These twenty-year plus planes were failing to meet the reconnaissance demands placed upon the squadron. On 31 July 1971, the squadron received its first delivery of the [[Lockheed EP-3|EP-3E Aries]] aircraft.<ref name=\":0\" /> These EP-3s were converted from [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3A and P-3B]] airframes. This relatively newer airframe gave the squadron a more reliable platform due to its commonality with the VP P-3s, the availability of parts, and the lower flight hours on the aircraft. It would take five years until the final EP-3E arrived in Rota. By the end of 1974, enough Aries were in Rota to let VQ-2 to stop operating its EC-121Ms. \n\nIn May of 1972, VQ-2 also received a TA-3B and a UP-3A to use for crew training and logistics. These aircraft flew regularly from Rota on local flights as well as airlifts and parts runs to various detachments ashore and afloat. Of note, after 1974, the detachment at Incirlik, relocated to [[Hellenikon Air Base|Athens]]. Due to Greece's popularity with British vacationers, the squadron saw an increase in intermarriage between its sailors and British nationals as well as with host nation citizens.\n\n===Continued Crisis===\n\nIn this decade, the Cold War continued with a lessening of tensions with the Soviet Union due to the Nixon administration's police of the [[D\u00e9tente|d\u00e9tente]]. While this reduced the frequency of operations in the North Atlantic, Baltic, and Germany, the decade was frequently marked by international crises in the Mediterranean. Notable among these were the fallout from [[1969 Libyan coup d'\u00e9tat| the 1969 coup in Libya]], the [[Black September|1970 Jordan Crisis]], the [[Yom Kippur War|1973 Yom Kippur War]], the [[1974 Cypriot coup d'\u00e9tat|1974 crisis in Cyprus]], and the [[Lebanese Civil War|multiple flareups]] in Lebanon. The US Sixth Fleet and its NATO allies maintained a presence offshore in response to all these crises. \n\nDespite d\u00e9tente, the Soviet Union was conducting a program of providing significant amounts of military hardware to its client states of Libya, Syria, and Egypt. At the same time, the Soviet Navy continued increasing its presence in the Mediterranean. While Egypt left the Soviet fold after the Yom Kippur War, the buildups on the levane and North Africa made the Central and Eastern Mediterranean hot spots for VQ-2's monitoring of Soviet naval units as well as activities ashore. As a result high tempo operations lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\nIn 1979, the [[Iranian Revolution]] saw an increased US presence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. In response, the Navy maintained at least one carrier battle group in the vicinity of the Gulf. VQ-2 shared the manning of carrier and Diego Garcia detachments.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"East\" /> This manning would continue until the third phase of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1982.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nAlthough the decade was less lethal than its predecessor, VQ-2 suffered the twelve aircrew fatalities and lost three aircraft in mishaps.\n# On 26 February 1970, EA-3B (BUNO 144851)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> was lost while operating from the [[USS Franklin D. Roosevelt (CV-42)|USS ''Franklin D. Roosevelt'']] in the Mediterranean. The [[Aircraft catapult|catapult]] system malfunctioned in mid-stroke, also known as a 'cold cat,\" resulting in the Whale \u201cdribbling\u201d off the bow and being run over by the carrier<ref name=\"East\" />. Four of the crew members died in the accident<ref name=\":2\"/> \n# On 8 March 1974, EA-3B (BUNO 142257)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> was lost while operating from the [[USS America (CV-66)|USS ''America '']]  in the Mediterranean. A cable parted in the [[Arresting gear]] when the tailhook caught the wire. The pilot who had begun retarding the throttles to idle as per standard procedure, slammed them forward managing to regain enough airspeed to get the plane off the angle and ditch it in the water off to the port side. This allowed the plane to avoid being run over by the ship. The America's plane guard helicopter recovered all the aircrew. The airframe continued to float and was deemed a hazard to navigation forcing the ship to have one of its [[LTV A-7 Corsair II|A-7A]]' strafe it to sink it<ref name=\"A3H\" />. \n# On 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach. All eight aircrew perished in the crash.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the 1970s, the command suffered no aircraft losses.\n\n==1980s==\n[[File:EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on USS Saratoga (CV-60) c1986.jpg|left|thumb|EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS]] Saratoga inn 1986.]]\n===Constant Change===\nThe 1980s saw VQ-2 continue flying the EP-3E and EA-3B aircraft at a high tempo. The squadron maintained a permanent detachment in Athens, but unlike its sister squadron, VQ-1 who had a permanently assigned Officer-in-Charge (OIC) at its [[Naval Air Facility Atsugi|Atsugi]] detachment, VQ-2 rotated its OIC with the aircrews. Throughout the decade,\n\n===Eastern and Central Med Hot Spots===\n\nVQ-2 was awarded the [[Navy Expeditionary Medal]] for participation in the Beirut evacuation and operations in the vicinity of [[Libya]] during [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|Operation El Dorado Canyon]], 12\u201317 April 1986.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOn 25 January 1987, an EA-3B crashed on the USS Nimitz killing all seven crew members.\n\n==1990s==\nIn the summer of 1990, the squadron provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of 2000 non-combatant personnel from war-stricken [[Liberia]] in [[operation Sharp Edge]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Lockheed EP-3E Orion (ARIES), USA - Navy AN2094464.jpg|thumb|EP-3E of VQ-2 based at Rota, Spain, seen arriving for [[Royal International Air Tattoo|RIAT]] '92.]]\nFrom August 1990 to April 1991, VQ-2 provided combat reconnaissance during operations [[Gulf War|Desert Shield/Desert Storm]], Proven Force, and [[Operation Provide Comfort|Provide Comfort]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 29 June 1991, the first EP-3E Aries II aircraft arrived in Rota and on 20 September 1991, the squadron retired the EA-3B Skywarrior the same year.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStarting in July 1992, VQ-2 flew support missions with Operations [[Operation Deny Flight|Deny Flight]], Provide Promise, Sharp Guard, Joint Endeavor, Decisive Endeavor, and Deliberate Guard providing combat reconnaissance and intelligence to [[NATO]] and [[United Nations]] forces in the Former [[Yugoslavia]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs of 1997, VQ-2 operated four EP-3E Aries II aircraft and two [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3C Orion]] aircraft from its home-base at Rota and two-plane detachment at [[Souda Bay|Naval Support Activity Souda Bay, Crete]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn March 1997, VQ-2 provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of non-combatant personnel from [[Albania]] following unrest from a failed [[Pyramid scheme|pyramid savings scheme]] during [[Operation Silver Wake]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==2000s==\nVQ-2 relocated from NS Rota, Spain, to NAS Whidbey Island, effective 1 September 2005. The relocation of VQ-2's six aircraft and 450 Sailors to the United States was in keeping with the Navy's ongoing transformation of forces in [[Europe]] and helped reduce costs and eliminate redundancies throughout its force structure worldwide. The move co-located the squadron with [[VQ-1]], already based at NAS Whidbey Island, and realized efficiency through the consolidation of personnel deployment practices, aircraft maintenance practices, and aircrew training for these unique Navy squadrons.<ref>{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Scheduled for Homeport Change|url = http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=18681|website = www.navy.mil|accessdate = 2015-11-08}}</ref>\n\n==2010s==\nThe squadron was disestablished on 22 May 2012 ending 57 years of service.

As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines. Having lost an aircraft and lives to hostile Soviet action, the aircrew appreciated the added takeoff and combat speed of the two [[Allison J33-A-10A]] turbojet engines mounted in the aft of the [[Pratt & Whitney R-4360-20A Wasp Major]] radial's nacelles<ref name=\"East\">East, Don C.</ref>. \n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A. By mid-1954, four P4M-1Qs and one [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune|Lockheed P2V-2 Neptune]] were at Lyautey. The P2V-2, stripped of ASW equipment, served as a trainer and logistics aircraft<ref name=\"StaHypo2\">{{Cite web|title = History Of VQ-2.

The Lyautey P2V-5Fs had additional turbojets mounted on nacelles where the rockets are in this photo.]]\nThe squadron continued using the six P4M-1Qs as mission aircraft. In addition, they obtained three Lockheed P2V-5Fs. The P2V-5Fs were reconfigured onsite from the standard maritime reconnaissance to similar electronic suites as the P-4Ms. Of note, the P2v-5Fs had the same dash speed capability as the P4Ms from two [[Westinghouse J34]]-WE-34 turbojets mounted on their own nacelles outboard the [[Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone|Wright R-3350-32W Cyclone Turbo-compound]] radials. The squadron used the P2V-3 for pilot training and logistics, since it was not configured for electronic reconnaissance (this became a standard squadron practice when possible; using a \"bare bones airframe of one of its models for training and logistics)<ref name=\"East\" />. The four Neptunes would serve alongside the Mercators until 1960.\n\nIn September 1956, a new and faster [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-capable]] [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A3D-1Q Skywarrior]] was delivered to the squadron. The A3D-1Q, nicknamed \"The Whale\" was a reconfigured A3D-1 with the bombay closed and an electronic reconnaissance suite installed similar to those of the P4M-1Q and P2V-5F<ref name=\"Francillon\">Francillon</ref><ref name=\"Heinemann\">Heinemann</ref><ref name=\"Gunston\">Gunston</ref>. The Whale was a carrier-capable high-wing, twin-jet aircraft with a crew of four<ref name= \"Winchester\">Winchester 2006, p. 75.</ref>. The A-3 was also one of the fastest non-afterburner aircraft in the US Armed Forces with a service ceiling significantly higher than the Mercators and Neptunes which gave the aircraft a greater area of coverage<ref name=\"East\"/>. The squadron also received an A3D-1 which it use like the P2V-3<ref name=\"East\" />. Although the pilots and navigators came to the command after carrier-qualifying, the squadron operated the A-3 from land bases until the next decade unlike her sister squadron VQ-1<ref name=\"Hypo2\" /><ref name=\"East\" />. With the high tempo of operations and depot-level maintenance for the three models back in the continental United States (CONUS), it is unsurprising that on 1 June 1957, the command had three P4M-1Q,, two A3D-1Q, two P2V-5F, one A3D-1, and one P2V-3 reported in its table of organization (TOE)<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\nThe [[1958 Lebanon crisis|Lebanon Crisis in 1958]] on 15 July 1958, saw a p4M-1Q and aircrew shift south from Incirlik to fly out of Beirut while the US Marines and US Army were deployed there at the behest of [[Camille Chamoun]], the President. VQ-2 operated out of [[Beirut Airport]] through the remainder of the summer and into the fall, departing with the withdrawal of US forces after stabilization in October 1958.\n\n===Homeport Change===\n\nAs a result of the Pact of Madrid, signed on 23 September 1953 by [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and the [[United States]], the US pledged  to furnish [[foreign aid|economic]] and [[military aid]] to Spain. The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\nThe relocation of the squadron to Rota began in late 1958 into the first days of 1959. The shift of the squadron CO, XO, and department heads (DHs) was completed by 14 January 1959, but it would take another year to transfer all command assets to Rota<ref name=\"East\" />. All assets at Lyautey had to be surveyed, packed up, and moved. \n\nDuring this evolution, five seven-seat A3D-2Q aircraft arrived to replace the four-seat A3D-1Qs. These new aircraft had the bulkhead between the  cockpit and the bomb bay removed, the bomb bay sealed, and three more seats and equipment added in the former bay.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"East\" />. This unarmed version (the tail gun had been removed<ref name=\"Francillon\" />) brought an increase in capability to the community.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the eleven aircrew fatalities and three aircraft in three mishaps:\n# On 6 January 1958, at the end of a ferry flight from Port Lyautey, via Lajes, Azores and Bermuda to [[NAS Norfolk]], Virginia, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124373)<ref name='VPNavy'>{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Mishaps|url =https://www.vpnavy.com/vq2_mishap.html|website = www.vpnavy.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> lost an engine on approach.

All four aircrew aboard were killed.\n\n==1960s==\n\n===Change===\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. On 14 January 1960, with all equipment and personnel out of Lyautey, VQ-2 officially transferred to Naval Station. \n\nThe Navy had recognized that the maintenance costs of the aging, worn P4M-1Q and P2V-5F airframes were increasingly more expensive to maintain, and these planes needed replacement. Washington opted for a larger, more capable aircraft, the [[EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. The \"Willie Victors,\" unarmed like the A3D-2Qs<ref name=\":0\" />, could carry a crew of twenty-six. On 26 February 1960, the first two WV-2Q arrived. By the end of the first quarter in 1960, 31 March, VQ-2'aircraft inventory were five A3D-2Q, three P2V-5F, two P4M-1Q, and two WV-2Q. The P2V-5F and P4M-1Q aircraft were soon to be phased out as all hands quickly adapted to the A3D-2Q and WV-2Q airframes. Meanwhile, the\u00b7squadron continued its business of airborne electronic reconnaissance. By the summer of 1960, the Mercators and Neptunes were gone.\n\nOn 18 September 1962, the Department of Defense (DoD) initiated its Tri-Service Aircraft Designation System which replaced the 1922 USN Aircraft Designation System. The new unified system for designating all US military aircraft was a ''Type/Model/Series'' (T/M/S).<ref name=\"TMS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.designation-systems.info/usmilav/aircraft.html|title=Current Designations of U.S. Military Aircraft|website = www.designation-systems.info|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref>. With this change, the A3D-2Q became the EA-3B and the WV-2Q became the EC-121M<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\n===In Theater Operations===\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs with A3D-2Qs filling in as needed<ref name=\":0\" />. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nFollowing the Cuban Missile Crisis was [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant<ref name=\"East\"/>. Afterwards, a series of eastern Mediterranean crises provided ample opportunities for VQ-2 to perform timely reconnaissance<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />. A major factor in the more direct tactical reconnaissance shipboard role was the rapidly growing and modernizing Soviet Navy that established a continuous presence in the Mediterranean, concurrent with the Cyprus Crisis. In response to these crises, VQ-2 started operating EA-3B detachments aboard a Mediterranean-based carriers like her sister squadron, VQ-1 did in the Pacific. In January of 1965, the first planes went aboard the [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS Saratoga (CVA-60)]]. Detachments aboardupport to the Mediterranean deployed carriers.\n\nWhile operating in Vietnam and the Philippines, the political tensions in the Middle East and North Africa were building. In June of 1967, armed conflict erupted into the [[Six-Day War]] where Israel defeated its enemies. The loss of the [[USS Liberty]] during the war at the hands of the IDF reaffirmed the relative safety of using aircraft for fleet reconnaissance<ref name=\"East\" />. This incident kept the high tempo of operations in the Eastern Mediterranean despite a cessation of strife in Cyprus. The coup in Libya in 1969 combined with the ever increasing presence of the Soviet Navy to counter the presence of the NATO navies in the Mediterranean kept the command operating at a high tempo.\n\nAs the decade came to a close, VQ-2 found itself operating all over Europe from various NATO bases, from US Sixth Fleet carriers, as well as in Southeast Asia.\n\n===Cuban Missile Crisis===\n\nIn October 1962 the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] developed. Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in CONUS<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />, VQ-2 deployed a number of EA-3B and an EC-121M aircraft to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba. After this major superpower crisis was defused, the assets returned to Spain. The squadron's rapidity and flexibility demonstrated in Florida<ref name=\"VQH\" /> kept it very busy when it returned to Europe where it resumed missions in the Mediterranean, Baltic, and central Europe. \n===Vietnam===\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown by EA-3Bs and EC-121Ms into the theater to support US Navy combat operations in Vietnam. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam in 1966, VQ-2 EA-3Bs joined them operating almost exclusively from there as VQ-2 DET BRAVO<ref name=\"East\" />. From both locations, VQ-2 aircraft provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]<ref name=\"East\" />. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the fifty-two aircrew fatalities and five aircraft in seven mishaps.\n# Two days after the official move, on 16 January 1960, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124365) crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]]. The crew had been flying in to relieve the detachment that had been operating there<ref name=\":0\" />.

The aircraft iced up, the engines flamed out, and it stalled into a spin. The pilot ordered the crew to bail out. The four aircrew in the aft compartment bailed. Just as the crew chief was getting ready to go, the pilot got a restart and recovered out of the spin. The aircraft with the pilot, navigator and crew chief made it back to DET ALFA. The other four perished with only one body recovered and the personal effects of the other three.<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /><ref name=\"StaHypo\" />\n# On 3 November 1966, an EA-3B (BUNO 146458)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> struck the water aft of the ship inbound to a night recovery on the [[USS Independence (CV-62)|USS Independence (CVA-62)]] in the central Mediterranean off [[Sicily]]. All six aircrew aboard were lost at sea.\n# Returning from a mission along the East German/Czech border in the during the \"[[Prague Spring]]\" of 1968, an EA-3B was entering the landing pattern at Ramstein AFB when it had a slat malfunction pitching nose-up turn.<ref name=\"East\" />.  With the plane seeming to enter a stall, the pilot signalled for a crew bail out. The four aircrew in the aft compartment bailed but at 1200 feet altitude. Again, just as the crew chief was getting ready to go, the slat suddenly operated allowing a recovery at Ramstein. Although bailing out at a low altitude, the four back end crew survived.<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /><ref name=\"StaHypo\" />\n# On 4 June 1968, an EA-3B (BUNO 142670)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" />, flown by the new (by barely beyond a month)squadron CO, CDR T.E.

The Whale lost an engine just after takeoff descended slowly until hitting the ground on the down slope of a hill cartwheeling into a sugar beet field approximately one mile east of the Rota runway. CDR Daum and three of his department heads who were aboard were killed. The crew chief and another petty officer survived.

DET BRAVO shipped the airframe to CONUS for repairs via sealift. In rough weather in Tokyo Bay on 14 December 1968, the plane broke loose from its tie downs and was lost overboard.\n\n==1970s==\n\n===Continued Change===\n[[File:EP-3E Orion of VQ-2 parked c1971.jpg|thumb|EP-3E Aries of VQ-2 parked in 1971]]\nIn the second decade of the squadron's forward basing in Spain, the American presence in Rota saw the relocation of the destroyer squadron that had been based in Athens arrive just as the submarine squadron returned to CONUS. <ref name=\"East\"/> The greater availability of assignments at the Aviation Intermediate Maintenance Depot (AIMD) across the hangar fro the squadron saw an increase in \"homesteading\" (remaining at one location as long as one's career would allow) by enlisted personnel as the rate of intermarriage with Spanish host nationals increased.\n\nThe EC-121Ms' career in the command had been a second lease on life since the airframes when acquired by VQ-2On 31 July 1971 were over ten years old<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"VQH\" />. These twenty-year plus planes were failing to meet the reconnaissance demands placed upon the squadron. On 31 July 1971, the squadron received its first delivery of the [[Lockheed EP-3|EP-3E Aries]] aircraft.<ref name=\":0\" /> These EP-3s were converted from [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3A and P-3B]] airframes. This relatively newer airframe gave the squadron a more reliable platform due to its commonality with the VP P-3s, the availability of parts, and the lower flight hours on the aircraft. It would take five years until the final EP-3E arrived in Rota. By the end of 1974, enough Aries were in Rota to let VQ-2 to stop operating its EC-121Ms. \n\nIn May of 1972, VQ-2 also received a TA-3B and a UP-3A to use for crew training and logistics. These aircraft flew regularly from Rota on local flights as well as airlifts and parts runs to various detachments ashore and afloat. Of note, after 1974, the detachment at Incirlik, relocated to [[Hellenikon Air Base|Athens]]. Due to Greece's popularity with British vacationers, the squadron saw an increase in intermarriage between its sailors and British nationals as well as with host nation citizens.\n\n===Continued Crisis===\n\nIn this decade, the Cold War continued with a lessening of tensions with the Soviet Union due to the Nixon administration's police of the [[D\u00e9tente|d\u00e9tente]]. While this reduced the frequency of operations in the North Atlantic, Baltic, and Germany, the decade was frequently marked by international crises in the Mediterranean. Notable among these were the fallout from [[1969 Libyan coup d'\u00e9tat| the 1969 coup in Libya]], the [[Black September|1970 Jordan Crisis]], the [[Yom Kippur War|1973 Yom Kippur War]], the [[1974 Cypriot coup d'\u00e9tat|1974 crisis in Cyprus]], and the [[Lebanese Civil War|multiple flareups]] in Lebanon. The US Sixth Fleet and its NATO allies maintained a presence offshore in response to all these crises. \n\nDespite d\u00e9tente, the Soviet Union was conducting a program of providing significant amounts of military hardware to its client states of Libya, Syria, and Egypt. At the same time, the Soviet Navy continued increasing its presence in the Mediterranean. While Egypt left the Soviet fold after the Yom Kippur War, the buildups on the levane and North Africa made the Central and Eastern Mediterranean hot spots for VQ-2's monitoring of Soviet naval units as well as activities ashore. As a result high tempo operations lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\nIn 1979, the [[Iranian Revolution]] saw an increased US presence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. In response, the Navy maintained at least one carrier battle group in the vicinity of the Gulf. VQ-2 shared the manning of carrier and Diego Garcia detachments.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"East\" /> This manning would continue until the third phase of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1982.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nAlthough the decade was less lethal than its predecessor, VQ-2 suffered the twelve aircrew fatalities and lost three aircraft in mishaps.\n# On 26 February 1970, EA-3B (BUNO 144851)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> was lost while operating from the [[USS Franklin D. Roosevelt (CV-42)|USS ''Franklin D. Roosevelt'']] in the Mediterranean. The [[Aircraft catapult|catapult]] system malfunctioned in mid-stroke, also known as a 'cold cat,\" resulting in the Whale \u201cdribbling\u201d off the bow and being run over by the carrier<ref name=\"East\" />. Four of the crew members died in the accident<ref name=\":2\"/> \n# On 8 March 1974, EA-3B (BUNO 142257)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> was lost while operating from the [[USS America (CV-66)|USS ''America '']]  in the Mediterranean. A cable parted in the [[Arresting gear]] when the tailhook caught the wire. The pilot who had begun retarding the throttles to idle as per standard procedure, slammed them forward managing to regain enough airspeed to get the plane off the angle and ditch it in the water off to the port side. This allowed the plane to avoid being run over by the ship. The America's plane guard helicopter recovered all the aircrew. The airframe continued to float and was deemed a hazard to navigation forcing the ship to have one of its [[LTV A-7 Corsair II|A-7A]]' strafe it to sink it<ref name=\"A3H\" />. \n# On 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach. All eight aircrew perished in the crash.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the 1970s, the command suffered no aircraft losses.\n\n==1980s==\n[[File:EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on USS Saratoga (CV-60) c1986.jpg|left|thumb|EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS]] Saratoga inn 1986.]]\n===Constant Change===\nAs VQ-2 entered the mid-1980s, the frenzied pace of operations including [[Operation Mole Cricket 19]](Arab-Israel [[Beqaa Valley|Beqaa]] War), and continuing with 1982 - 1983 [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|Beirut Crisis]] with the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|U.S. Marine barracks bombing]], and the [[United States Sixth Fleet|Sixth Fleet]] December [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|1983 air strike into Lebanon]], allowed little leisure time for the squadron.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Eastern and Central Med Hot Spots===\n\nVQ-2 was awarded the [[Navy Expeditionary Medal]] for participation in the Beirut evacuation and operations in the vicinity of [[Libya]] during [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|Operation El Dorado Canyon]], 12\u201317 April 1986.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOn 25 January 1987, an EA-3B crashed on the USS Nimitz killing all seven crew members.\n\n==1990s==\nIn the summer of 1990, the squadron provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of 2000 non-combatant personnel from war-stricken [[Liberia]] in [[operation Sharp Edge]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Lockheed EP-3E Orion (ARIES), USA - Navy AN2094464.jpg|thumb|EP-3E of VQ-2 based at Rota, Spain, seen arriving for [[Royal International Air Tattoo|RIAT]] '92.]]\nFrom August 1990 to April 1991, VQ-2 provided combat reconnaissance during operations [[Gulf War|Desert Shield/Desert Storm]], Proven Force, and [[Operation Provide Comfort|Provide Comfort]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 29 June 1991, the first EP-3E Aries II aircraft arrived in Rota and on 20 September 1991, the squadron retired the EA-3B Skywarrior the same year.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStarting in July 1992, VQ-2 flew support missions with Operations [[Operation Deny Flight|Deny Flight]], Provide Promise, Sharp Guard, Joint Endeavor, Decisive Endeavor, and Deliberate Guard providing combat reconnaissance and intelligence to [[NATO]] and [[United Nations]] forces in the Former [[Yugoslavia]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs of 1997, VQ-2 operated four EP-3E Aries II aircraft and two [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3C Orion]] aircraft from its home-base at Rota and two-plane detachment at [[Souda Bay|Naval Support Activity Souda Bay, Crete]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn March 1997, VQ-2 provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of non-combatant personnel from [[Albania]] following unrest from a failed [[Pyramid scheme|pyramid savings scheme]] during [[Operation Silver Wake]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==2000s==\nVQ-2 relocated from NS Rota, Spain, to NAS Whidbey Island, effective 1 September 2005.

Methane life is hypothetically possible.\n|-\n| Non-green photosynthesizers\n| Other speculations\n| Alternate plant life\n| Physicists have noted that, although photosynthesis on Earth generally involves green plants, a variety of other-colored plants could also support photosynthesis, essential for most life on Earth, and that other colors might be preferred in places that receive a different mix of stellar radiation than Earth.\n|-\n| [[Shadow biosphere]]\n| Alternative environment\n| A hidden life biosphere on [[Earth]]\n| A shadow biosphere is a hypothetical [[microbe|microbial]] [[biosphere]] of Earth that uses radically different [[biochemistry|biochemical]] and [[molecular biology|molecular]] processes than currently known life.\n|-\n| Silicon biochemistry ([[Organosilicon]])\n| Alternative biochemistry\n| Silicon-based life\n| Like carbon, silicon can create molecules that are sufficiently large to carry biological information; however, the scope of possible silicon chemistry is far more limited than that of carbon.\n|-\n| [[Silicon dioxide]] biochemistry\n| Non-water solvents\n| [[Silicon dioxide]]-based life\n| [[Gerald Feinberg]] and [[Robert Shapiro (chemist)|Robert Shapiro]] have suggested that molten silicate rock could serve as a liquid medium for organisms with a chemistry based on silicon, oxygen, and other elements such as [[aluminium]].\n|-\n| Sulfur biochemistry\n| Alternative biochemistry\n| Sulfur-based life\n| The biological use of sulfur as an alternative to carbon is purely hypothetical, especially because sulfur usually forms only linear chains rather than branched ones.\n|-\n|}\n''NOTES:'' All information referenced and cited below.\n\n===Alternative-chirality biomolecules===\nPerhaps the least unusual alternative biochemistry would be one with differing [[Left-handed protein|chirality]] of its biomolecules.

Silicon, unlike carbon, lacks the ability to form chemical bonds with diverse types of atoms as is necessary for the chemical versatility required for metabolism, and yet this precise inability is what makes silicon less susceptible to bond with all sorts of impurities from which carbon, in comparison, is not shielded. Elements creating organic functional groups with carbon include hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and metals such as iron, magnesium, and zinc. Silicon, on the other hand, interacts with very few other types of atoms.<ref name=\"Pace\"/> Moreover, where it does interact with other atoms, silicon creates molecules that have been described as \"monotonous compared with the combinatorial universe of organic macromolecules\".<ref name=\"Pace\"/> This is because silicon atoms are much bigger, having a larger [[mass]] and [[atomic radius]], and so have difficulty forming double bonds (the double-bonded carbon is part of the [[carbonyl]] group, a fundamental motif of carbon-based bio-organic chemistry).\n\n[[Silanes]], which are [[chemical compound]]s of [[hydrogen]] and silicon that are analogous to the [[alkane]] [[hydrocarbon]]s, are highly reactive with [[water (molecule)|water]], and long-chain silanes spontaneously decompose. Molecules incorporating [[polymer]]s of alternating silicon and [[oxygen]] atoms instead of direct bonds between silicon, known collectively as [[silicone]]s, are much more stable. It has been suggested that silicone-based chemicals would be more stable than equivalent hydrocarbons in a sulfuric-acid-rich environment, as is found in some extraterrestrial locations.<ref name=\"world-building\">{{cite book |first=Stephen |last=Gillette |title=World-Building |publisher=Writer's Digest Books |isbn=978-0-89879-707-7|year=1996 }}</ref>\n\nOf the varieties of molecules identified in the [[interstellar medium]] {{As of|1998|lc=on}}, 84 are based on carbon, while only 8 are based on silicon.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/astronomy/faq/part6/section-16.html |title= F.10 Why do we assume that other beings must be based on carbon?

Also, even though [[Earth]] and other [[terrestrial planet]]s are exceptionally silicon-rich and carbon-poor (the relative abundance of silicon to carbon in Earth's crust is roughly 925:1), terrestrial life is carbon-based. The fact that carbon is used instead of silicon may be evidence that silicon is poorly suited for biochemistry on Earth-like planets. Reasons for which may be that silicon is less versatile than carbon in forming compounds, that the compounds formed by silicon are unstable, and that it blocks the flow of heat.<ref name=BC>{{cite web | url = http://biocab.org/Astrobiology.html | title = Astrobiology | accessdate = 2011-01-17 | date = September 26, 2006 | publisher = Biology Cabinet}}</ref>\n\nEven so, [[biogenic silica]] is used by some Earth life, such as the [[silicate]] skeletal structure of [[diatom]]s.

This complexity offers a large number of pathways for evolution to produce life, many other solvents{{which|date=November 2018}} have dramatically fewer possible reactions, which severely limits evolution.\n* Thermodynamic stability:  the free energy of formation of liquid water is low enough (\u2212237.24 kJ/mol) that water undergoes few reactions.  Other solvents are highly reactive, particularly with oxygen.\n* Water does not combust in oxygen because it is already the combustion product of hydrogen with oxygen. Most alternative solvents are not stable in an oxygen-rich atmosphere, so it is highly unlikely that those liquids could support aerobic life.\n* A large temperature range over which it is [[liquid phase|liquid]].\n* High solubility of oxygen and carbon dioxide at room temperature supporting the evolution of aerobic aquatic plant and animal life.\n* A high [[heat capacity]] (leading to higher environmental temperature stability).\n* Water is a room-temperature liquid leading to a large population of quantum transition states required to overcome reaction barriers. Cryogenic liquids (such as liquid methane) have exponentially lower transition state populations which are needed for life based on chemical reactions. This leads to chemical reaction rates which may be so slow as to preclude the development of any life based on chemical reactions.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n* Spectroscopic transparency allowing solar radiation to penetrate several meters into the liquid (or solid), greatly aiding the evolution of aquatic life.\n* A large [[heat of vaporization]] leading to stable lakes and oceans.\n* The ability to dissolve a wide variety of compounds.\n* The solid (ice) has lower density than the liquid, so ice floats on the liquid. This is why bodies of water freeze over but do not freeze solid (from the bottom up). If ice were denser than liquid water (as is true for nearly all other compounds), then large bodies of liquid would slowly freeze solid, which would not be conducive to the formation of life.\n\nWater as a compound is cosmically abundant, although much of it is in the form of vapour or ice. Subsurface liquid water is considered likely or possible on several of the outer moons: [[Enceladus]] (where geysers have been observed), [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], and [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]]. Earth and Titan are the only worlds currently known to have stable bodies of liquid on their surfaces.\n\nNot all properties of water are necessarily advantageous for life, however.<ref name=\"barosswater\">Committee on the Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems, Committee on the Origins and Evolution of Life, National Research Council; [http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11919&page=70 The Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems]; The National Academies Press, 2007; page 70.</ref> For instance, water ice has a high [[albedo]],<ref name=\"barosswater\"/> meaning that it reflects a significant quantity of light and heat from the Sun. During [[ice age]]s, as reflective ice builds up over the surface of the water, the effects of global cooling are increased.<ref name=\"barosswater\"/>\n\nThere are some properties that make certain compounds and elements much more favorable than others as solvents in a successful biosphere. The solvent must be able to exist in liquid equilibrium over a range of temperatures the planetary object would normally encounter. Because boiling points vary with the pressure, the question tends not to be ''does'' the prospective solvent remain liquid, but ''at what pressure''. For example, [[hydrogen cyanide]] has a narrow liquid-phase temperature range at 1&nbsp;atmosphere, but in an atmosphere with the pressure of [[Venus]], with {{convert|92|bar|atm}} of pressure, it can indeed exist in liquid form over a wide temperature range.\n\n====Ammonia====\n[[File:Ammonia World.jpg|320px|thumb|right|Artist's conception of how a planet with ammonia-based life might look]]\nThe [[ammonia]] molecule (NH<sub>3</sub>), like the water molecule, is abundant in the universe, being a compound of hydrogen (the simplest and most common element) with another very common element, nitrogen.<ref name=\"asimov\"/> The possible role of liquid ammonia as an alternative solvent for life is an idea that goes back at least to 1954, when [[J.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;S.

Haldane made the point that various common water-related organic compounds have ammonia-related analogs; for instance the ammonia-related [[amine]] group (\u2212NH<sub>2</sub>) is analogous to the water-related [[hydroxyl]] group (\u2212OH).<ref name=\"ddammonia\"/>\n\nAmmonia, like water, can either accept or donate an H<sup>+</sup> ion. When ammonia accepts an H<sup>+</sup>, it forms the [[ammonium]] cation (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>), analogous to [[hydronium]] (H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>). When it donates an H<sup>+</sup> ion, it forms the [[metal amides|amide]] anion (NH<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>), analogous to the [[hydroxide]] anion (OH<sup>\u2212</sup>).<ref name=\"barossammonia\"/> Compared to water, however, ammonia is more inclined to accept an H<sup>+</sup> ion, and less inclined to donate one; it is a stronger [[nucleophile]].<ref name=\"barossammonia\"/> Ammonia added to water functions as [[Arrhenius base]]: it increases the concentration of the anion hydroxide. Conversely, using a [[Acid-base reaction#Solvent system definition|solvent system definition]] of acidity and basicity, water added to liquid ammonia functions as an acid, because it increases the concentration of the cation ammonium.<ref name=\"ddammonia\"/> The carbonyl group (C=O), which is much used in terrestrial biochemistry, would not be stable in ammonia solution, but the analogous [[imine]] group (C=NH) could be used instead.<ref name=\"barossammonia\"/>\n\nHowever, ammonia has some problems as a basis for life. The [[hydrogen bonds]] between ammonia molecules are weaker than those in water, causing ammonia's [[heat of vaporization]] to be half that of water, its [[surface tension]] to be a third, and reducing its ability to concentrate non-polar molecules through a [[hydrophobic]] effect.

Therefore, ammonia-based life, if it exists, might metabolize more slowly and evolve more slowly than life on Earth.<ref name=\"dsmammonia\"/> On the other hand, lower temperatures could also enable living systems to use chemical species that would be too unstable at Earth temperatures to be useful.<ref name=\"asimov\"/>\n\nAmmonia could be a liquid at Earth-like temperatures, but at much higher pressures; for example, at 60&nbsp;[[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]], ammonia melts at \u221277&nbsp;\u00b0C (196&nbsp;K) and boils at 98&nbsp;\u00b0C (371&nbsp;K).<ref name=\"barossammonia\"/>\n\nAmmonia and ammonia\u2013water mixtures remain liquid at temperatures far below the freezing point of pure water, so such biochemistries might be well suited to planets and moons orbiting outside the water-based [[habitability zone]].

Silicon, unlike carbon, lacks the ability to form chemical bonds with diverse types of atoms as is necessary for the chemical versatility required for metabolism, and yet this precise inability is what makes silicon less susceptible to bond with all sorts of impurities from which carbon, in comparison, is not shielded. Elements creating organic functional groups with carbon include hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and metals such as iron, magnesium, and zinc. Silicon, on the other hand, interacts with very few other types of atoms.<ref name=\"Pace\"/> Moreover, where it does interact with other atoms, silicon creates molecules that have been described as \"monotonous compared with the combinatorial universe of organic macromolecules\".<ref name=\"Pace\"/> This is because silicon atoms are much bigger, having a larger [[mass]] and [[atomic radius]], and so have difficulty forming double bonds (the double-bonded carbon is part of the [[carbonyl]] group, a fundamental motif of carbon-based bio-organic chemistry).\n\n[[Silanes]], which are [[chemical compound]]s of [[hydrogen]] and silicon that are analogous to the [[alkane]] [[hydrocarbon]]s, are highly reactive with [[water (molecule)|water]], and long-chain silanes spontaneously decompose. Molecules incorporating [[polymer]]s of alternating silicon and [[oxygen]] atoms instead of direct bonds between silicon, known collectively as [[silicone]]s, are much more stable. It has been suggested that silicone-based chemicals would be more stable than equivalent hydrocarbons in a sulfuric-acid-rich environment, as is found in some extraterrestrial locations.<ref name=\"world-building\">{{cite book |first=Stephen |last=Gillette |title=World-Building |publisher=Writer's Digest Books |isbn=978-0-89879-707-7|year=1996 }}</ref>\n\nOf the varieties of molecules identified in the [[interstellar medium]] {{As of|1998|lc=on}}, 84 are based on carbon, while only 8 are based on silicon.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/astronomy/faq/part6/section-16.html |title= F.10 Why do we assume that other beings must be based on carbon?

Also, even though [[Earth]] and other [[terrestrial planet]]s are exceptionally silicon-rich and carbon-poor (the relative abundance of silicon to carbon in Earth's crust is roughly 925:1), terrestrial life is carbon-based. The fact that carbon is used instead of silicon may be evidence that silicon is poorly suited for biochemistry on Earth-like planets. Reasons for which may be that silicon is less versatile than carbon in forming compounds, that the compounds formed by silicon are unstable, and that it blocks the flow of heat.<ref name=BC>{{cite web | url = http://biocab.org/Astrobiology.html | title = Astrobiology | accessdate = 2011-01-17 | date = September 26, 2006 | publisher = Biology Cabinet}}</ref>\n\nEven so, [[biogenic silica]] is used by some Earth life, such as the [[silicate]] skeletal structure of [[diatom]]s.

This complexity offers a large number of pathways for evolution to produce life, many other solvents{{which|date=November 2018}} have dramatically fewer possible reactions, which severely limits evolution.\n* Thermodynamic stability:  the free energy of formation of liquid water is low enough (\u2212237.24 kJ/mol) that water undergoes few reactions.  Other solvents are highly reactive, particularly with oxygen.\n* Water does not combust in oxygen because it is already the combustion product of hydrogen with oxygen. Most alternative solvents are not stable in an oxygen-rich atmosphere, so it is highly unlikely that those liquids could support aerobic life.\n* A large temperature range over which it is [[liquid phase|liquid]].\n* High solubility of oxygen and carbon dioxide at room temperature supporting the evolution of aerobic aquatic plant and animal life.\n* A high [[heat capacity]] (leading to higher environmental temperature stability).\n* Water is a room-temperature liquid leading to a large population of quantum transition states required to overcome reaction barriers. Cryogenic liquids (such as liquid methane) have exponentially lower transition state populations which are needed for life based on chemical reactions. This leads to chemical reaction rates which may be so slow as to preclude the development of any life based on chemical reactions.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n* Spectroscopic transparency allowing solar radiation to penetrate several meters into the liquid (or solid), greatly aiding the evolution of aquatic life.\n* A large [[heat of vaporization]] leading to stable lakes and oceans.\n* The ability to dissolve a wide variety of compounds.\n* The solid (ice) has lower density than the liquid, so ice floats on the liquid. This is why bodies of water freeze over but do not freeze solid (from the bottom up). If ice were denser than liquid water (as is true for nearly all other compounds), then large bodies of liquid would slowly freeze solid, which would not be conducive to the formation of life.\n\nWater as a compound is cosmically abundant, although much of it is in the form of vapour or ice. Subsurface liquid water is considered likely or possible on several of the outer moons: [[Enceladus]] (where geysers have been observed), [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], and [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]]. Earth and Titan are the only worlds currently known to have stable bodies of liquid on their surfaces.\n\nNot all properties of water are necessarily advantageous for life, however.<ref name=\"barosswater\">Committee on the Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems, Committee on the Origins and Evolution of Life, National Research Council; [http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11919&page=70 The Limits of Organic Life in Planetary Systems]; The National Academies Press, 2007; page 70.</ref> For instance, water ice has a high [[albedo]],<ref name=\"barosswater\"/> meaning that it reflects a significant quantity of light and heat from the Sun. During [[ice age]]s, as reflective ice builds up over the surface of the water, the effects of global cooling are increased.<ref name=\"barosswater\"/>\n\nThere are some properties that make certain compounds and elements much more favorable than others as solvents in a successful biosphere. The solvent must be able to exist in liquid equilibrium over a range of temperatures the planetary object would normally encounter. Because boiling points vary with the pressure, the question tends not to be ''does'' the prospective solvent remain liquid, but ''at what pressure''. For example, [[hydrogen cyanide]] has a narrow liquid-phase temperature range at 1&nbsp;atmosphere, but in an atmosphere with the pressure of [[Venus]], with {{convert|92|bar|atm}} of pressure, it can indeed exist in liquid form over a wide temperature range.\n\n====Ammonia====\n[[File:Ammonia World.jpg|320px|thumb|right|Artist's conception of how a planet with ammonia-based life might look]]\nThe [[ammonia]] molecule (NH<sub>3</sub>), like the water molecule, is abundant in the universe, being a compound of hydrogen (the simplest and most common element) with another very common element, nitrogen.<ref name=\"asimov\"/> The possible role of liquid ammonia as an alternative solvent for life is an idea that goes back at least to 1954, when [[J.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;S.

Haldane made the point that various common water-related organic compounds have ammonia-related analogs; for instance the ammonia-related [[amine]] group (\u2212NH<sub>2</sub>) is analogous to the water-related [[hydroxyl]] group (\u2212OH).<ref name=\"ddammonia\"/>\n\nAmmonia, like water, can either accept or donate an H<sup>+</sup> ion. When ammonia accepts an H<sup>+</sup>, it forms the [[ammonium]] cation (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>), analogous to [[hydronium]] (H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>). When it donates an H<sup>+</sup> ion, it forms the [[metal amides|amide]] anion (NH<sub>2</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>), analogous to the [[hydroxide]] anion (OH<sup>\u2212</sup>).<ref name=\"barossammonia\"/> Compared to water, however, ammonia is more inclined to accept an H<sup>+</sup> ion, and less inclined to donate one; it is a stronger [[nucleophile]].<ref name=\"barossammonia\"/> Ammonia added to water functions as [[Arrhenius base]]: it increases the concentration of the anion hydroxide. Conversely, using a [[Acid-base reaction#Solvent system definition|solvent system definition]] of acidity and basicity, water added to liquid ammonia functions as an acid, because it increases the concentration of the cation ammonium.<ref name=\"ddammonia\"/> The carbonyl group (C=O), which is much used in terrestrial biochemistry, would not be stable in ammonia solution, but the analogous [[imine]] group (C=NH) could be used instead.<ref name=\"barossammonia\"/>\n\nHowever, ammonia has some problems as a basis for life. The [[hydrogen bonds]] between ammonia molecules are weaker than those in water, causing ammonia's [[heat of vaporization]] to be half that of water, its [[surface tension]] to be a third, and reducing its ability to concentrate non-polar molecules through a [[hydrophobic]] effect.

Therefore, ammonia-based life, if it exists, might metabolize more slowly and evolve more slowly than life on Earth.<ref name=\"dsmammonia\"/> On the other hand, lower temperatures could also enable living systems to use chemical species that would be too unstable at Earth temperatures to be useful.<ref name=\"asimov\"/>\n\nAmmonia could be a liquid at Earth-like temperatures, but at much higher pressures; for example, at 60&nbsp;[[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]], ammonia melts at \u221277&nbsp;\u00b0C (196&nbsp;K) and boils at 98&nbsp;\u00b0C (371&nbsp;K).<ref name=\"barossammonia\"/>\n\nAmmonia and ammonia\u2013water mixtures remain liquid at temperatures far below the freezing point of pure water, so such biochemistries might be well suited to planets and moons orbiting outside the water-based [[habitability zone]].

His managerial career began at [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] and later he managed [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. He most recently worked as the manager of [[Al-Ahli Dubai]]. The majority of his 20-year playing career was spent as a  [[central defender]] at [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].  O'Leary's tally of 722 appearances for the [[North London]] side stands as a club record.<ref name=ArsenalCaps />\n\n==Club career==\nO'Leary was born in [[Stoke Newington]], London on 2 May 1958 and moved to live in [[Dublin, Ireland|Dublin]] at the age of four.<ref name=\"O'Leary1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/sport/david-o-leary-life-and-times-1.206323|title=David O'Leary: Life and Times|website=The Irish Times}}</ref>\n\n===Arsenal===\nA [[Shelbourne F.C.|Shelbourne]] schoolboy player O'Leary signed for Arsenal as an apprentice in 1973. He soon progressed through the ranks at Highbury, playing in the reserves at the age of 16. He made his debut for Arsenal against [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] on 16 August 1975, and despite being only 17, went on to make 30 appearances that season. For the next ten years he was ever-present in the Arsenal side, playing more than 40 matches a season (except for [[1980\u201381 in English football|1980\u201381]], where he was injured and only played 27).\n\nA calm and collected [[central defender]], O'Leary was noted for his good positioning and elegant style of play. He won his first major honour with Arsenal when he played in their 3\u20132 win over [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the [[1979 FA Cup Final]]. He also played in the 1978 and 1980 Cup finals, and the 1980 [[Cup Winners' Cup]] final, all of which Arsenal lost. In 1982 O'Leary became club captain, but relinquished it to [[Graham Rix]] eighteen months later.<ref name=Dave>{{cite web|url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/gunners-greatest-players-14.-david-o-leary|title=Greatest 50 Players: 14.

He passed [[George Armstrong (footballer)|George Armstrong]]'s all-time record of 621 first-team games in November 1989. By this time, O'Leary was no longer automatic first choice (with the partnership of [[Tony Adams (footballer)|Tony Adams]] and [[Steve Bould]] at the centre of [[George Graham (footballer)|George Graham]]'s defence), but he still turned in over 20 appearances as Arsenal won the [[1988\u201389 in English football|1988\u201389]] [[Football League First Division|First Division]] title thanks to a [[Liverpool 0\u20132 Arsenal (26 May 1989)|2\u20130 win at Anfield]] on the final day of the season.\n\nO'Leary won another League title in [[1990\u201391 in English football|1991]] and an FA Cup and [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] double in [[1992\u201393 in English football|1993]], though by this time he was mainly used as a [[substitute (soccer)|sub]].

Throughout 1993\u201394, O'Leary was a regular player in the Leeds side until he suffered an [[Achilles' tendon|achilles]] injury, which ruled him out for the whole of the following season. He was still on the club's payroll at the beginning of the 1995\u201396 season but that September he gave in to his injury and announced his retirement from football at the age of 37, after only 14 appearances in all competitions.\n\n==International career==\nO'Leary's international debut with the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] came as a teenager in a 1\u20131 draw with [[England national football team|England]] in 1976. Following the appointment of [[Jack Charlton]], O'Leary was frozen out of the international set up for 2 years. After being left out of a squad for a mini tournament in Iceland in May 1986, O'Leary booked a family holiday which he decided not to cancel when he was eventually asked up to the squad following several withdrawals. O'Leary did not feature until November 1988 thus missing out on [[UEFA Euro 1988|Euro 88]].\nThe highlight of his 68-cap international career came in the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]]. With Ireland in a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]] with [[Romania national football team|Romania]], [[Pat Bonner|Packie Bonner]] saved [[Daniel Timofte]]'s last penalty. It was O'Leary, who then stepped up to take the decisive final penalty to win the shootout 5\u20134 to take Ireland to the quarterfinals of the Cup. O'Leary's strike has since been voted as the greatest moment in Irish footballing history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2015/0625/710625-live-world-cup-1990-ireland-v-romania/|title=As it happened: World Cup Ireland v Romania|website=RTE.ie}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://irishpost.co.uk/its-25-years-since-david-oleary-scored-that-penalty-for-ireland-against-romania-at-italia-90/|title=It's 25 years since David O'Leary scored that penalty|website=Irish Post.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/12011/9889945/ireland8217s-world-cup-joy-david-o8217leary-recalls-his-penalty-v-romania|title=Ireland's World Cup joy: David O'Leary recalls his penalty v Romania|publisher=Sky Sports}}</ref>\n\nShortly after the World Cup, O'Leary scored his only goal for the Republic in a 5\u20130 win over [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]] in a [[UEFA Euro 1992 qualifying|Euro 92 qualifier]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=1992/matches/round=218/match=3023/index.html|title=Republic of Ireland 5 \u2013 Turkey 0|website=UEFA.com}}</ref>\n\n==Managerial career==\n\nWhen the former Arsenal manager [[George Graham (footballer)|George Graham]] was put in charge at [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] in September 1996, O'Leary was installed as his assistant. He remained in this position for a period of  two years.\n\n===Leeds United===\nThe Leeds United board offered several candidates the manager's position following George Graham's departure, but such deals fell through. During this time O'Leary's Leeds side did creditably well in league matches.\nAs this was the case  O'Leary was subsequently promoted to manager at the [[Yorkshire]] club.\n\nAt the end of the 1998\u20131999 season Leeds finished fourth in the [[FA Premier League|Premier League]] and qualified for the [[UEFA Cup]]. Their [[1999\u20132000 UEFA Cup#Semi-finals|1999-2000 UEFA Cup]] campaign ended in the Cup semi-final with defeat to the Turkish side [[Galatasaray S.K. (football team)|Galatasaray]], following the [[2000 UEFA Cup semi-final violence|murders of two Leeds fans during violence the night before]].\nOn the domestic front, Leeds finished third in the Premier League and qualified for the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]]. It would be their first campaign at this level since the 1992\u201393 season. It was during this time that O'Leary endorsed a [[Game Boy Color]] computer game entitled ''[[O'Leary Manager 2000]]'', which was released by [[Ubi Soft]] in 2000.\n\nLeeds reached the semi-finals of the Champions League in [[2000\u201301 UEFA Champions League#Semi-finals|2000-01]], where they lost to eventual runners-up [[Valencia CF|Valencia]]. Their Premier League form also dipped slightly and O'Leary's men had to settle for a [[UEFA Cup]] place, finishing fourth in the last [[2000\u201301 FA Premier League|season]] before the Champions League qualification spots for the English Premiership expanded from the top three to the top four. Although there was little indication of this at the time, this was a serious failure for the club because [[Peter Ridsdale]] had borrowed \u00a360&nbsp;million against future gate receipts, budgeting for prolonged Champions League involvement.\n\nThe [[2001\u201302 FA Premier League|2001\u201302 season]] began well for Leeds. They frequently topped the table during the first half of the season and were Premier League leaders on 1 January 2002. But a loss of form in the second half of the season saw them slump into fifth place, again just outside the Champions League qualification spots, meaning that they would again have to settle for a UEFA Cup place.\n\nThis period was thrown into turmoil by the involvement of four players, including first-teamers [[Jonathan Woodgate]] and [[Lee Bowyer]], in an incident in Leeds city centre that ended in the assault and injury of an Asian student in January 2000, with the second trial ending in December 2001. O'Leary to some extent alienated the fans, and more importantly Ridsdale, by writing a book, ''Leeds United on Trial'',{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} that some{{Who|date=July 2010}} saw as cashing in on the troubles the club had suffered.\n\nBy June 2002, O'Leary had spent almost \u00a3100&nbsp;million on new players in less than four years for no reward in terms of trophies, but he had never finished outside the top five as a manager. Ridsdale sacked O'Leary as Leeds manager in the summer of 2002, replacing him with [[Terry Venables]]. O'Leary's departure signalled a downhill spiral for the club \u2013 highly attributable to the financial state that saw the sale of several key players \u2013 which saw three more managers (Venables, [[Peter Reid]] and [[Eddie Gray (footballer, born 1948)|Eddie Gray]]) come and go before the club was finally relegated from the Premier League in 2004 with \u00a380&nbsp;million debt, and fell into [[Football League One|League One]] (the third tier of the league) three years later. This fall from grace led to the phrase \u2018[[Doing a Leeds]]\u2019.\n\nO'Leary's fame at Leeds rests upon his promotion of a series of younger players, [[Jonathan Woodgate]], [[Lee Bowyer]], [[Alan Smith (footballer, born 1980)|Alan Smith]], [[Harry Kewell]], [[Stephen McPhail]], [[Eirik Bakke]], [[Ian Harte]] and [[Danny Mills]] (signed for \u00a34&nbsp;million from [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]]). He promoted several members of the youth team into an exciting Leeds side that played a pressing game relying on youthful enthusiasm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the42.ie/5-best-young-premier-league-teams-2633916-Feb2016/|title=David O'Leary's 'babies' and the best-ever young Premier League teams|website=The 42.ie}}</ref>\n\nIn an interview regarding the decline of Leeds, O'Leary stated  \"I never wanted to leave [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds]]. The fans are fantastic to me here. I hope they stay up because I had great times at the club\".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/leeds_united/6557065.stm ''Leeds still have time \u2013 O'Leary''] [[BBC Sport]] 15 April 2007</ref>\n\nO'Leary has since stated that he would like the chance to return as manager of Leeds United,<ref>[http://www.thescratchingshed.com/2009/06/oleary-wants-his-job-back/ ''O'Leary Wants His Job Back! \u2013 The Scratching Shed'']{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} 30 June 2009</ref> after Peter Ridsdale left the club. The news was met with mixed views from Leeds United fans.\n\n===Aston Villa===\nO'Leary was linked with various other vacant manager's jobs throughout the 2002\u201303 season. He was hot favourite to become manager of [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] when Peter Reid was sacked in October and again when [[Howard Wilkinson]] was sacked in March of that season.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/sunderland/2838431.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Stadium of Light contenders|date=10 March 2003}}</ref>\n\nBut O'Leary remained out of work until June 2003, when he was appointed manager of [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]].\n\nBy the beginning of November 2003, Aston Villa were hovering just above the relegation zone. O'Leary's team finished in sixth place \u2013 one place too low for European qualification due to [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall's]] [[2004 FA Cup Final|FA Cup Final]] appearance and [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough's]] [[2004 Football League Cup Final|League Cup]] triumph.\n\n====2004\u201305====\nIn 2004\u201305 Villa finished tenth in the league, a drop from the previous season. Despite this, O'Leary once again avoided any risk of relegation and signed [[A.C. Milan]]'s international defender [[Martin Laursen]], [[Carlton Cole]] and French midfielder [[Mathieu Berson]].\n\n====2005\u201306====\nDespite six summer acquisitions including [[Milan Baro\u0161]] and [[Kevin Phillips (footballer)|Kevin Phillips]] a series of poor results saw Villa hovering dangerously above the relegation zone going into December, with just 17 points from 17 games. However, an improved winter period saw them move slightly up the league, with victories over [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] (4\u20130), [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] (4\u20130) and a point against runaway leaders [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. In the end, Villa finished 16th, just two places above the relegation zone. Following the relegation of local rivals [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] and [[West Bromwich Albion]], Villa were the only Midlands side playing Premier League football in 2006\u201307.\n\nOn 19 July 2006, O'Leary's contract as [[Aston Villa]] manager was terminated by mutual consent.

His managerial career began at [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] and later he managed [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. He most recently worked as the manager of [[Al-Ahli Dubai]]. The majority of his 20-year playing career was spent as a  [[central defender]] at [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].  O'Leary's tally of 722 appearances for the [[North London]] side stands as a club record.<ref name=ArsenalCaps />\n\n==Club career==\nO'Leary was born in [[Stoke Newington]], London on 2 May 1958 and moved to live in [[Dublin, Ireland|Dublin]] at the age of four.<ref name=\"O'Leary1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/sport/david-o-leary-life-and-times-1.206323|title=David O'Leary: Life and Times|website=The Irish Times}}</ref>\n\n===Arsenal===\nA [[Shelbourne F.C.|Shelbourne]] schoolboy player O'Leary signed for Arsenal as an apprentice in 1973. He soon progressed through the ranks at Highbury, playing in the reserves at the age of 16. He made his debut for Arsenal against [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] on 16 August 1975, and despite being only 17, went on to make 30 appearances that season. For the next ten years he was ever-present in the Arsenal side, playing more than 40 matches a season (except for [[1980\u201381 in English football|1980\u201381]], where he was injured and only played 27).\n\nA calm and collected [[central defender]], O'Leary was noted for his good positioning and elegant style of play. He won his first major honour with Arsenal when he played in their 3\u20132 win over [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the [[1979 FA Cup Final]]. He also played in the 1978 and 1980 Cup finals, and the 1980 [[Cup Winners' Cup]] final, all of which Arsenal lost. In 1982 O'Leary became club captain, but relinquished it to [[Graham Rix]] eighteen months later.<ref name=Dave>{{cite web|url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/gunners-greatest-players-14.-david-o-leary|title=Greatest 50 Players: 14.

He passed [[George Armstrong (footballer)|George Armstrong]]'s all-time record of 621 first-team games in November 1989. By this time, O'Leary was no longer automatic first choice (with the partnership of [[Tony Adams (footballer)|Tony Adams]] and [[Steve Bould]] at the centre of [[George Graham (footballer)|George Graham]]'s defence), but he still turned in over 20 appearances as Arsenal won the [[1988\u201389 in English football|1988\u201389]] [[Football League First Division|First Division]] title thanks to a [[Liverpool 0\u20132 Arsenal (26 May 1989)|2\u20130 win at Anfield]] on the final day of the season.\n\nO'Leary won another League title in [[1990\u201391 in English football|1991]] and an FA Cup and [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] double in [[1992\u201393 in English football|1993]], though by this time he was mainly used as a [[substitute (soccer)|sub]].

Throughout 1993\u201394, O'Leary was a regular player in the Leeds side until he suffered an [[Achilles' tendon|achilles]] injury, which ruled him out for the whole of the following season. He was still on the club's payroll at the beginning of the 1995\u201396 season but that September he gave in to his injury and announced his retirement from football at the age of 37, after only 14 appearances in all competitions.\n\n==International career==\nO'Leary's international debut with the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] came as a teenager in a 1\u20131 draw with [[England national football team|England]] in 1976. Following the appointment of [[Jack Charlton]], O'Leary was frozen out of the international set up for 2 years. After being left out of a squad for a mini tournament in Iceland in May 1986, O'Leary booked a family holiday which he decided not to cancel when he was eventually asked up to the squad following several withdrawals. O'Leary did not feature until November 1988 thus missing out on [[UEFA Euro 1988|Euro 88]].\nThe highlight of his 68-cap international career came in the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]]. With Ireland in a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]] with [[Romania national football team|Romania]], [[Pat Bonner|Packie Bonner]] saved [[Daniel Timofte]]'s last penalty. It was O'Leary, who then stepped up to take the decisive final penalty to win the shootout 5\u20134 to take Ireland to the quarterfinals of the Cup. O'Leary's strike has since been voted as the greatest moment in Irish footballing history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2015/0625/710625-live-world-cup-1990-ireland-v-romania/|title=As it happened: World Cup Ireland v Romania|website=RTE.ie}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://irishpost.co.uk/its-25-years-since-david-oleary-scored-that-penalty-for-ireland-against-romania-at-italia-90/|title=It's 25 years since David O'Leary scored that penalty|website=Irish Post.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/12011/9889945/ireland8217s-world-cup-joy-david-o8217leary-recalls-his-penalty-v-romania|title=Ireland's World Cup joy: David O'Leary recalls his penalty v Romania|publisher=Sky Sports}}</ref>\n\nShortly after the World Cup, O'Leary scored his only goal for the Republic in a 5\u20130 win over [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]] in a [[UEFA Euro 1992 qualifying|Euro 92 qualifier]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=1992/matches/round=218/match=3023/index.html|title=Republic of Ireland 5 \u2013 Turkey 0|website=UEFA.com}}</ref>\n\n==Managerial career==\n\nWhen the former Arsenal manager [[George Graham (footballer)|George Graham]] was put in charge at [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] in September 1996, O'Leary was installed as his assistant. He remained in this position for a period of  two years.\n\n===Leeds United===\nThe Leeds United board offered several candidates the manager's position following George Graham's departure, but such deals fell through. During this time O'Leary's Leeds side did creditably well in league matches.\nAs this was the case  O'Leary was subsequently promoted to manager at the [[Yorkshire]] club.\n\nAt the end of the 1998\u20131999 season Leeds finished fourth in the [[FA Premier League|Premier League]] and qualified for the [[UEFA Cup]]. Their [[1999\u20132000 UEFA Cup#Semi-finals|1999-2000 UEFA Cup]] campaign ended in the Cup semi-final with defeat to the Turkish side [[Galatasaray S.K. (football team)|Galatasaray]], following the [[2000 UEFA Cup semi-final violence|murders of two Leeds fans during violence the night before]].\nOn the domestic front, Leeds finished third in the Premier League and qualified for the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]]. It would be their first campaign at this level since the 1992\u201393 season. It was during this time that O'Leary endorsed a [[Game Boy Color]] computer game entitled ''[[O'Leary Manager 2000]]'', which was released by [[Ubi Soft]] in 2000.\n\nLeeds reached the semi-finals of the Champions League in [[2000\u201301 UEFA Champions League#Semi-finals|2000-01]], where they lost to eventual runners-up [[Valencia CF|Valencia]]. Their Premier League form also dipped slightly and O'Leary's men had to settle for a [[UEFA Cup]] place, finishing fourth in the last [[2000\u201301 FA Premier League|season]] before the Champions League qualification spots for the English Premiership expanded from the top three to the top four. Although there was little indication of this at the time, this was a serious failure for the club because [[Peter Ridsdale]] had borrowed \u00a360 million against future gate receipts, budgeting for prolonged Champions League involvement.\n\nThe [[2001\u201302 FA Premier League|2001\u201302 season]] began well for Leeds. They frequently topped the table during the first half of the season and were Premier League leaders on 1 January 2002. But a loss of form in the second half of the season saw them slump into fifth place, again just outside the Champions League qualification spots, meaning that they would again have to settle for a UEFA Cup place.\n\nThis period was thrown into turmoil by the involvement of four players, including first-teamers [[Jonathan Woodgate]] and [[Lee Bowyer]], in an incident in Leeds city centre that ended in the assault and injury of an Asian student in January 2000, with the second trial ending in December 2001. O'Leary to some extent alienated the fans, and more importantly Ridsdale, by writing a book, ''Leeds United on Trial'',{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} that some{{Who|date=July 2010}} saw as cashing in on the troubles the club had suffered.\n\nBy June 2002, O'Leary had spent almost \u00a3100 million on new players in less than four years for no reward in terms of trophies, but he had never finished outside the top five as a manager. Ridsdale sacked O'Leary as Leeds manager in the summer of 2002, replacing him with [[Terry Venables]]. O'Leary's departure signalled a downhill spiral for the club \u2013 highly attributable to the financial state that saw the sale of several key players \u2013 which saw three more managers (Venables, [[Peter Reid]] and [[Eddie Gray (footballer, born 1948)|Eddie Gray]]) come and go before the club was finally relegated from the Premier League in 2004 with \u00a380 million debt, and fell into [[Football League One|League One]] (the third tier of the league) three years later. This fall from grace led to the phrase \u2018[[Doing a Leeds]]\u2019.\n\nO'Leary's fame at Leeds rests upon his promotion of a series of younger players, [[Jonathan Woodgate]], [[Lee Bowyer]], [[Alan Smith (footballer, born 1980)|Alan Smith]], [[Harry Kewell]], [[Stephen McPhail]], [[Eirik Bakke]], [[Ian Harte]] and [[Danny Mills]] (signed for \u00a34M from [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]]). He promoted several members of the youth team into an exciting Leeds side that played a pressing game relying on youthful enthusiasm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the42.ie/5-best-young-premier-league-teams-2633916-Feb2016/|title=David O'Leary's 'babies' and the best-ever young Premier League teams|website=The 42.ie}}</ref>\n\nIn an interview regarding the decline of Leeds, O'Leary stated  \"I never wanted to leave [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds]].

I hope they stay up because I had great times at the club\".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/leeds_united/6557065.stm ''Leeds still have time \u2013 O'Leary''] [[BBC Sport]] 15 April 2007</ref>\n\nO'Leary has since stated that he would like the chance to return as manager of Leeds United,<ref>[http://www.thescratchingshed.com/2009/06/oleary-wants-his-job-back/ ''O'Leary Wants His Job Back! \u2013 The Scratching Shed'']{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} 30 June 2009</ref> after Peter Ridsdale left the club. The news was met with mixed views from Leeds United fans.\n\n===Aston Villa===\nO'Leary was linked with various other vacant manager's jobs throughout the 2002\u201303 season. He was hot favourite to become manager of [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] when Peter Reid was sacked in October and again when [[Howard Wilkinson]] was sacked in March of that season.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/sunderland/2838431.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Stadium of Light contenders|date=10 March 2003}}</ref>\n\nBut O'Leary remained out of work until June 2003, when he was appointed manager of [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]].\n\nBy the beginning of November 2003, Aston Villa were hovering just above the relegation zone. O'Leary's team finished in sixth place \u2013 one place too low for European qualification due to [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall's]] [[2004 FA Cup Final|FA Cup Final]] appearance and [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough's]] [[2004 Football League Cup Final|League Cup]] triumph.\n\n====2004\u201305====\nIn 2004\u201305 Villa finished tenth in the league, a drop from the previous season. Despite this, O'Leary once again avoided any risk of relegation and signed [[A.C. Milan]]'s international defender [[Martin Laursen]], [[Carlton Cole]] and French midfielder [[Mathieu Berson]].\n\n====2005\u201306====\nDespite six summer acquisitions including [[Milan Baro\u0161]] and [[Kevin Phillips (footballer)|Kevin Phillips]] a series of poor results saw Villa hovering dangerously above the relegation zone going into December, with just 17 points from 17 games. However, an improved winter period saw them move slightly up the league, with victories over [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] (4\u20130), [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] (4\u20130) and a point against runaway leaders [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. In the end, Villa finished 16th, just two places above the relegation zone. Following the relegation of local rivals [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] and [[West Bromwich Albion]], Villa were the only Midlands side playing Premier League football in 2006\u201307.\n\nOn 19 July 2006, O'Leary's contract as [[Aston Villa]] manager was terminated by mutual consent. Chairman Doug Ellis sold the club within a few months to [[Randy Lerner]], and [[Martin O'Neill]] was appointed as manager.\n\n===Al-Ahli===\nO'Leary returned to management on 4 July 2010 with [[United Arab Emirates]] club [[Al-Ahli Dubai]], where his first decision was to install former [[Italy national football team|Italy]] captain [[Fabio Cannavaro]] as the new skipper of the team.\nOn 2 April 2011, O'Leary was relieved of his duties following a 5-1 defeat at the hands of [[Al Jazira Club|Al Jazira]].<ref>[http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/2931/go-global/2011/04/02/2422824/david-oleary-to-be-sacked-as-coach-of-dubai-side-al-ahli David O'Leary to be sacked as coach of Dubai side Al Ahli - report - Goal.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> On 22 April 2011, Al-Ahli officially announced its decision to sack O'Leary with his assistant coach [[Roy Aitken]].<ref>[http://www.arabianbusiness.com/david-o-leary-sacked-by-dubai-s-al-ahli-football-team-395601.html David O'Leary sacked by Dubai's Al Ahli football team - ArabianBusiness.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> When he was sacked, O'Leary had two years remaining on a three-year contract.

The fire killed 167 people<ref name = \"O'Nan\">Stewart O'Nan, ''The Circus Fire: A True Story of an American Tragedy''; Anchor, 2001.</ref> and more than 700 were injured.\n\n==Background==\nIn mid-20th century America, a typical [[circus]] traveled from town to town by train, performing under a huge canvas tent commonly called a \"big top\". The [[Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus]] was no exception: what made it stand out was that it was the largest circus in the country. Its big top could seat 9,000 spectators around its three rings; the tent's canvas had been coated with {{Convert|1800|lb|kg}} of [[paraffin wax]] dissolved in {{convert|6000|gal|l}} of [[gasoline]], a common waterproofing method of the time.<ref name=\"O'Nan\"/>\n\nThe circus had been experiencing shortages of personnel and equipment as a result of the United States' involvement in [[World War II]]. Delays and malfunctions in the ordinarily smooth order of the circus had become commonplace; on August 4, 1942, a fire had broken out in the [[menagerie]], killing a number of animals. When the circus arrived in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], on July 5, 1944, the trains were so late that one of the two shows scheduled for that day had been canceled.<ref>\"They were late out of Providence and blew the matinee. They'd been late all season\u2014in Bridgeport and Fitchburg and Manchester\u2014but this was the first show they'd blown. They blamed the trains. According to the front-page story in the Hartford Times: \"There was a divergence of opinion between circus and railroad officials as to what occasioned the delay. A spokesman for the show said the 72-foot flatcars needed to transport the main tent were 'unable to negotiate sharp curves in the railroad' between Hartford and Willimantic. Railroad dispatchers (with the New York, New Haven & Hartford) said the train was never scheduled to go that way. 'It came up the main line via the Cedar Hill yards in New Haven on schedule.'\"\" O'Nan, p. 26.</ref> In circus [[superstition]], [[the show must go on|missing a show is considered extremely bad luck]], and although the July 5, 1944 evening show ran as planned, many circus employees may have been on their guard, half-expecting an emergency or catastrophe.<ref>\"It was bad luck blowing a show, and show folks were notoriously superstitious. Since the great aerialist [[Lillian Leitzel]]'s fatal fall, Merle Evans, the conductor of the band, refused to play \"Crimson Petal,\" her theme music. Scranton, where the show closed in the strike year, was a jinx town. Whistling in the dressing room was bad luck, and peanut shells on the floor, and the old camelback trunks, but blowing a show was the worst.\" O'Nan, p. 28.</ref>\n\nThe next day was a Thursday; the crowd at the afternoon performance was dominated by women and children.<ref name = \"O'Nan\" /> The size of the audience that day has never been established with certainty, but the best estimate is about 7,000.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mystery of dead girl in Hartford circus fire solved after 47 years|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_5RGAAAAIBAJ&sjid=VvgMAAAAIBAJ&pg=1397,1856387&dq=hartford+circus+fire+1944+attenda&hl=en|accessdate=December 6, 2010|newspaper=The Day|date=March 10, 1991}}</ref>\n\n==The fire==\n{{butts More citations needed section|date=April 2019}}\nThe fire began as a small flame after the lions performed, on the southwest sidewall of the tent, while the [[The Flying Wallendas|Great Wallendas]] were performing. Circus bandleader [[Merle Evans]] was said to have been the first to spot the flames, and immediately directed the band to play \"[[The Stars and Stripes Forever]]\", the tune that traditionally signaled distress to all circus personnel.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Circus songs : an annotated anthology|author=Studwell, William E. |date=1999|publisher=Haworth Press|others=Conrad, Charles P., Schueneman, Bruce R., 1955-|isbn=0789008793|location=New York|pages=272|oclc=43083929}}</ref> [[Ringmaster (circus)|Ringmaster]] Fred Bradna urged the audience not to panic and to leave in an orderly fashion, but the power failed and he could not be heard. Bradna and the ushers unsuccessfully tried to maintain some order as the panicked crowd tried to flee the big top.\n\nThe only animals in the big top at the time were the big cats trained by May Kovar and Joseph Walsh that had just finished performing when the fire started. The big cats were herded through the chutes leading from the performing cages to several cage wagons, and were unharmed except for a few minor burns. Though most spectators were able to escape the fire, many people were caught up in the [[hysteria]]. Witnesses said some simply ran around in circles trying to find their loved ones, rather than trying to escape from the burning tent. Some escaped but ran back inside to look for family members. Others stayed in their seats until it was too late, assuming that the fire would be put out promptly. Because at least two of the exits were blocked by the chutes used to bring the show's big cats in and out of the tent, people trying to escape could not bypass them.\n\nThe cause of the fire remains unsolved. Investigators at the time believed it was caused by a carelessly flicked cigarette; however, others suspected an [[arson]]ist. Several years later, while being investigated on other arson charges, Robert Dale Segee (1929\u20131997), who was an adolescent at the time, confessed to starting the blaze. He was never tried for the crime and later recanted his confession.\n\nBecause of the [[paraffin wax]] waterproofing of the tent, the flames spread rapidly. Many people were badly burned by the melting paraffin, which rained down from the roof. The fiery tent collapsed in about eight minutes according to eyewitness survivors, trapping hundreds of spectators beneath it.<ref>''The Hartford Circus Fire: Tragedy Under the Big Top'' {{ISBN|1-625-84522-7}} p. 61</ref> Because of a picture that appeared in several newspapers of sad tramp clown [[Emmett Kelly]] holding a water bucket, the event became known as \"the day the clowns cried.\"\n\n== Victims ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2019}}\nWhile many people burned to death, many others died as a result of the ensuing chaos. Sources and investigators differ on how many people were killed and injured. Various people and organizations say it was 167, 168, or 169 persons (the 168 figure is usually based on official tallies that included a collection of body parts that were listed as a \"victim\") with official treated injury estimates running over 700 people. The number of actual injuries is believed to be higher than those figures, since many people were seen that day heading home in shock without seeking treatment in the city.\n\nIt is commonly believed that the number of fatalities is higher than the estimates given, due to poorly kept residency records in rural towns, and the fact that some smaller remains were never identified or claimed. Additionally, free tickets had been handed out that day to many people in and around the city, some of whom appeared to eyewitnesses and circus employees to be [[Vagrancy|drifters]] who would never have been reported missing.\n\nSome died from injuries sustained after leaping from the tops of the [[bleacher]]s in hopes they could escape under the sides of the tent, though that method of escape ended up killing more than it saved. Others died after being trampled by other spectators, with some [[asphyxia]]ting underneath the piles of people who fell over each other. Most of the dead were found in piles, some three bodies deep, at the most congested exits. A small number of people were found alive at the bottoms of these piles, protected by the bodies on top of them when the burning big top ultimately fell down.\n\n==First investigation==\nOn July 7, 1944 charges of [[Manslaughter|involuntary manslaughter]] were filed against five officials and employees of Ringling Bros.<ref>{{cite news|title=Circus Fire |date=February 22, 1945 |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/78760008 |accessdate=February 18, 2019|newspaper=The Daily News}}</ref> Within days of these charges being filed, the circus reached an agreement with Hartford officials to accept full financial responsibility and pay whatever amount the city requested in damages. This resulted in the circus paying out almost US$5,000,000 to the 600 victims and families who had filed claims against them by 1954. All circus profits from the time of the fire until then had been set aside to pay off these claims.\n\nAlthough the circus accepted full responsibility for the financial damages, they did not accept responsibility for the disaster itself. The five men charged were brought to trial in late 1944; four were convicted. Although they were given prison terms, the four men found guilty were allowed to continue with the circus to their next stop, in [[Sarasota, Florida]], to help the company set itself up again after the disaster. Shortly after their convictions, they were pardoned entirely. One of the men, [[James A. Haley]], went on to serve in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] for 24 years.\n\n==Segee's confession==\nIn 1950, Robert Dale Segee of [[Circleville, Ohio]] claimed during a police interview that he was responsible for setting the circus fire.<ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite news\n|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1950/07/01/archives/youth-confesses-fatal-circus-fire-held-for-arson.html\n|title=Youth Confesses Fatal Circus Fire; Held for Arson\n|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]\n|date=July 1, 1950\n|quote=A husky 20-year-old circus roustabout, by his own words a killer and arsonist since the age of 6, has confessed to touching off the blaze that took 168 lives as it swept through the Ringling Brothers circus six years ago, authorities claimed today.\n}}</ref> Following the Ohio police interview, Segee signed a statement admitting to setting the circus fire, a series of other fires, and several murders since his youth.<ref name=\"NYT\"/> Segee, a 16-year-old [[roustabout]] for the show from June 30 to July 14, 1944, claimed that he had a nightmare in which an [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] riding on a \"flaming horse\" told him to set fires.<ref name=\"NYT\"/> According to police authorities, Segee further stated that after this nightmare his mind went blank, and by the time it cleared the circus fire had been set.<ref name=\"NYT\"/> Some of Segee's hand-drawn images of his bizarre dreams, and images depicting his claimed murders, appeared in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' on July 17, 1950.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fUoEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA51&dq=Robert+Dale+Segee&as_pt=MAGAZINES#v=onepage&q=Robert%20Dale%20Segee&f=false |title=The Strange Case of the Serial Arsonist|work=[[Life (magazine)|Life]]|date=July 17, 1950|page=51|accessdate=March 31, 2019}}</ref> \n\nIn November 1950, Segee was convicted in [[Ohio]] of unrelated arson charges and sentenced to 44 years of prison time. However, Hartford investigators raised doubts over his confession, as he had a history of mental illness, and it could not be proven he was anywhere within the state of [[Connecticut]] when the fire occurred. Connecticut officials were also not allowed to question Segee, even though his alleged crime had occurred in their state.<ref name=\"NYT\"/> Additionally, Segee, who died in 1997, denied setting the fire as late as 1994 during an interview. Because of this, many investigators, historians and victims believe the true arsonist\u2014if it had indeed been arson\u2014was never found.\n\n==Little Miss 1565==\n[[File:LittleMiss1565.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Little Miss 1565]]The best-known victim of the circus fire was a young blonde girl wearing a white dress. She is known only as \"Little Miss 1565\", named after the number assigned to her body at the city's makeshift [[morgue]]. Oddly well preserved even after her death, her face has become arguably the most familiar image of the fire.\n\nHer true identity has been a topic of debate and frustration in the Hartford area since the fire occurred. She was buried without a name in Hartford's Northwood cemetery, where a victims' memorial also stands. Two police investigators, Sgts. Thomas Barber and Edward Lowe, photographed her and took fingerprints, footprints, and dental charts. Despite massive publicity and repeated displays of the famous photograph in nationwide magazines, she was never claimed. Barber and Lowe spent the rest of their lives trying to identify her. They decorated her grave with flowers each Christmas, [[Memorial Day]], and July 4.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=_E0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA11&lpg=PA11&dq=%22Thomas+Barber%22+Little+Miss+1565&source=bl&ots=clluxNhTD6&sig=0Rb21HaK2bP19v1y1QQrr0CiG1M&hl=en&ei=VJgBTNbhL4TWNoWPgDs&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CBkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false A Man's Tender Search for a Name for Little Miss 1565].

Davey also contends that there was a conspiracy within the judicial system to convict the Ringling defendants, and that Segee was the arsonist. Before writing the book, Davey spent six years researching the case and conducting his own experiments as to how the fire really may have started. He described the original investigation both \"flawed and primitive\", though he did not work on the original case. Eleanor's brother Donald Cook had contacted authorities in 1955 insisting that the girl was his sister, but nothing came of it,<ref name=\"Cohn, p. 17\"/> and Donald later worked with Davey to establish her identity.

Found May 29, 2010.</ref>\n\n===Ongoing questions===\nVarious assertions put forth in ''A Matter of Degree'' have been fiercely disputed by investigators who worked on the case, as well as by other writers, most notably [[Stewart O'Nan]], who published ''The Circus Fire: A True Story of an American Tragedy'' in 2001. O'Nan points to the fact that Little Miss 1565 had blonde hair, while Eleanor Cook was a brunette. The shape of Little Miss 1565's face and that of Eleanor Cook are dissimilar, and the heights and ages of the two girls do not match up.\n\nPerhaps most significantly, when shown a photograph of Little Miss 1565, Eleanor's mother Mildred Corintha Parsons Cook immediately stated that this was not her daughter. She firmly maintained that stance until her death in 1997, age 91. Badly injured in the fire, Mrs. Cook had been unable to claim her two dead children, and was too emotionally traumatized to pursue it later. She had been told that Eleanor was not in any of the locations where bodies were kept for identification. She believed that Eleanor was one of two children who had been burnt beyond recognition and remain unidentified. O'Nan thinks she may be body number 1503. He further points to the differences in the [[Forensic dentistry|dental records]] of Eleanor Cook and the records made of Little Miss 1565 after her death.\n\nAs O'Nan and others have pointed out, the most likely scenario is that a family claiming a body early on mistakenly identified Eleanor Cook as their own child and she is buried under that child's name. Even when \"Little Miss 1565's\" picture ran in the papers, they failed to recognize her as their own due to their desire to put the traumatic event behind them. While DNA analysis could end this debate definitively, the logistics of exhuming all the likely candidates for this mix-up make this unlikely.\n\nWith the questions over whether Eleanor Cook is the true identity of Little Miss 1565 still unanswered in the eyes of many, the body was exhumed after the release of ''A Matter of Degree'' and buried in [[Southampton, Massachusetts]], next to the body of Edward Cook, the brother of Eleanor Cook and a victim of the circus fire himself. In 1992, her [[death certificate]] was officially changed from the previous identification of \"1565\". Since then, the Cook family has raised questions about whether the body is indeed that of Eleanor Cook, and some investigators have come to believe Eleanor's body may have been another of the unclaimed bodies from the fire and not Little Miss 1565.\n\n==Personal accounts==\nOne of the survivors of the fire, Maureen Krekian, discussed her ordeal in 2007. She was 11 at the time of the fire, and lived on the same road where the circus was held. On the day of the event, she was supposed to go to the circus with a woman next door and her daughter. When she went to their house, she found that they had already left without her. She decided to go to the circus on her own, where she seated herself in the bleachers.<ref name=\"krekian\">\"[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=11768511 Remembering the Horror and Heroes of a Circus Fire]\".

And this ball of fire just got bigger and bigger and bigger. By that time, everybody was panicking. The exit was blocked with the cages that the animals were brought in and out with. And there was a man taking kids and flinging them up and over that cage to get them out. I was sitting up in the bleachers and jumped down \u2014 I was three-quarters of the way up. You jump down and it was all straw underneath. There was a young man, a kid, and he had a pocketknife. And he slit the tent, took my arm and pulled me out.<ref name=\"krekian\"/></blockquote>\n\nAs she was being pulled out, Krekian grabbed another little girl's arm and pulled her out as well.<ref name=\"krekian\"/>\n\nActor and theater director [[Charles Nelson Reilly]], who was 13 years old at the time, survived the fire and dramatized it in the film of his stage show, ''[[The Life of Reilly]]''. In a 1997 interview, Reilly said that he rarely attended the theater, despite being a director, since the sound of a large audience in a theater reminded him of the large crowd at the circus before the disaster. He also said during his latter show that his mother, whom he had disobeyed after she told him not to go to the circus on that day with his friend, caught them sneaking out of her sight and scolded them, saying \"I hope it burns to the ground!\"<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ-a4eCFMFc&index=13&list=PL59B9706770CC4F27|title=The Life of Reilly \u2013 13 Hartford Circus Fire|date=July 16, 2010|work=YouTube|accessdate=June 22, 2015}}</ref>\n\nFrieda Pushnik, who performed with the circus as the \"Armless and Legless Wonder\", was rescued by a minstrel show performer.

The [[Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus]] was no exception: what made it stand out was that it was the largest circus in the country. Its big top could seat 9,000 spectators around its three rings; the tent's canvas had been coated with {{Convert|1800|lb|kg}} of [[paraffin wax]] dissolved in {{convert|6000|gal|l}} of [[gasoline]], a common waterproofing method of the time.<ref name=\"O'Nan\"/>\n\nThe circus had been experiencing shortages of personnel and equipment as a result of the United States' involvement in [[World War II]]. Delays and malfunctions in the ordinarily smooth order of the circus had become commonplace; on August 4, 1942, a fire had broken out in the [[menagerie]], killing a number of animals. When the circus arrived in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], on July 5, 1944, the trains were so late that one of the two shows scheduled for that day had been canceled.<ref>\"They were late out of Providence and blew the matinee. They'd been late all season\u2014in Bridgeport and Fitchburg and Manchester\u2014but this was the first show they'd blown. They blamed the trains. According to the front-page story in the Hartford Times: \"There was a divergence of opinion between circus and railroad officials as to what occasioned the delay. A spokesman for the show said the 72-foot flatcars needed to transport the main tent were 'unable to negotiate sharp curves in the railroad' between Hartford and Willimantic.

Circus bandleader [[Merle Evans]] was said to have been the first to spot the flames, and immediately directed the band to play \"[[The Stars and Stripes Forever]]\", the tune that traditionally signaled distress to all circus personnel.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Circus songs : an annotated anthology|author=Studwell, William E. |date=1999|publisher=Haworth Press|others=Conrad, Charles P., Schueneman, Bruce R., 1955-|isbn=0789008793|location=New York|pages=272|oclc=43083929}}</ref> [[Ringmaster (circus)|Ringmaster]] Fred Bradna urged the audience not to panic and to leave in an orderly fashion, but the power failed and he could not be heard. Bradna and the ushers unsuccessfully tried to maintain some order as the panicked crowd tried to flee the big top.\n\nThe only animals in the big top at the time were the big cats trained by May Kovar and Joseph Walsh that had just finished performing when the fire started. The big cats were herded through the chutes leading from the performing cages to several cage wagons, and were unharmed except for a few minor burns. Though most spectators were able to escape the fire, many people were caught up in the [[hysteria]]. Witnesses said some simply ran around in circles trying to find their loved ones, rather than trying to escape from the burning tent. Some escaped but ran back inside to look for family members. Others stayed in their seats until it was too late, assuming that the fire would be put out promptly. Because at least two of the exits were blocked by the chutes used to bring the show's big cats in and out of the tent, people trying to escape could not bypass them.\n\nThe cause of the fire remains unsolved. Investigators at the time believed it was caused by a carelessly flicked cigarette; however, others suspected an [[arson]]ist. Several years later, while being investigated on other arson charges, Robert Dale Segee (1929\u20131997), who was an adolescent at the time, confessed to starting the blaze. He was never tried for the crime and later recanted his confession.\n\nBecause of the [[paraffin wax]] waterproofing of the tent, the flames spread rapidly. Many people were badly burned by the melting paraffin, which rained down from the roof. The fiery tent collapsed in about eight minutes according to eyewitness survivors, trapping hundreds of spectators beneath it.<ref>''The Hartford Circus Fire: Tragedy Under the Big Top'' {{ISBN|1-625-84522-7}} p. 61</ref> Because of a picture that appeared in several newspapers of sad tramp clown [[Emmett Kelly]] holding a water bucket, the event became known as \"the day the clowns cried.\"\n\n== Victims ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2019}}\nWhile many people burned to death, many others died as a result of the ensuing chaos. Sources and investigators differ on how many people were killed and injured. Various people and organizations say it was 167, 168, or 169 persons (the 168 figure is usually based on official tallies that included a collection of body parts that were listed as a \"victim\") with official treated injury estimates running over 700 people. The number of actual injuries is believed to be higher than those figures, since many people were seen that day heading home in shock without seeking treatment in the city.\n\nIt is commonly believed that the number of fatalities is higher than the estimates given, due to poorly kept residency records in rural towns, and the fact that some smaller remains were never identified or claimed. Additionally, free tickets had been handed out that day to many people in and around the city, some of whom appeared to eyewitnesses and circus employees to be [[Vagrancy|drifters]] who would never have been reported missing.\n\nSome died from injuries sustained after leaping from the tops of the [[bleacher]]s in hopes they could escape under the sides of the tent, though that method of escape ended up killing more than it saved. Others died after being trampled by other spectators, with some [[asphyxia]]ting underneath the piles of people who fell over each other. Most of the dead were found in piles, some three bodies deep, at the most congested exits. A small number of people were found alive at the bottoms of these piles, protected by the bodies on top of them when the burning big top ultimately fell down.\n\n==First investigation==\nOn July 7, 1944 charges of [[Manslaughter|involuntary manslaughter]] were filed against five officials and employees of Ringling Bros.<ref>{{cite news|title=Circus Fire |date=February 22, 1945 |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/78760008 |accessdate=February 18, 2019|newspaper=The Daily News}}</ref> Within days of these charges being filed, the circus reached an agreement with Hartford officials to accept full financial responsibility and pay whatever amount the city requested in damages. This resulted in the circus paying out almost US$5,000,000 to the 600 victims and families who had filed claims against them by 1954. All circus profits from the time of the fire until then had been set aside to pay off these claims.\n\nAlthough the circus accepted full responsibility for the financial damages, they did not accept responsibility for the disaster itself. The five men charged were brought to trial in late 1944; four were convicted. Although they were given prison terms, the four men found guilty were allowed to continue with the circus to their next stop, in [[Sarasota, Florida]], to help the company set itself up again after the disaster. Shortly after their convictions, they were pardoned entirely. One of the men, [[James A. Haley]], went on to serve in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] for 24 years.\n\n==Segee's confession==\nIn 1950, Robert Dale Segee of [[Circleville, Ohio]] claimed during a police interview that he was responsible for setting the circus fire.<ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite news\n|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1950/07/01/archives/youth-confesses-fatal-circus-fire-held-for-arson.html\n|title=Youth Confesses Fatal Circus Fire; Held for Arson\n|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]\n|date=July 1, 1950\n|quote=A husky 20-year-old circus roustabout, by his own words a killer and arsonist since the age of 6, has confessed to touching off the blaze that took 168 lives as it swept through the Ringling Brothers circus six years ago, authorities claimed today.\n}}</ref> Following the Ohio police interview, Segee signed a statement admitting to setting the circus fire, a series of other fires, and several murders since his youth.<ref name=\"NYT\"/> Segee, a 16-year-old [[roustabout]] for the show from June 30 to July 14, 1944, claimed that he had a nightmare in which an [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] riding on a \"flaming horse\" told him to set fires.<ref name=\"NYT\"/> According to police authorities, Segee further stated that after this nightmare his mind went blank, and by the time it cleared the circus fire had been set.<ref name=\"NYT\"/> Some of Segee's hand-drawn images of his bizarre dreams, and images depicting his claimed murders, appeared in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' on July 17, 1950.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fUoEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA51&dq=Robert+Dale+Segee&as_pt=MAGAZINES#v=onepage&q=Robert%20Dale%20Segee&f=false |title=The Strange Case of the Serial Arsonist|work=[[Life (magazine)|Life]]|date=July 17, 1950|page=51|accessdate=March 31, 2019}}</ref> \n\nIn November 1950, Segee was convicted in [[Ohio]] of unrelated arson charges and sentenced to 44 years of prison time. However, Hartford investigators raised doubts over his confession, as he had a history of mental illness, and it could not be proven he was anywhere within the state of [[Connecticut]] when the fire occurred. Connecticut officials were also not allowed to question Segee, even though his alleged crime had occurred in their state.<ref name=\"NYT\"/> Additionally, Segee, who died in 1997, denied setting the fire as late as 1994 during an interview. Because of this, many investigators, historians and victims believe the true arsonist\u2014if it had indeed been arson\u2014was never found.\n\n==Little Miss 1565==\n[[File:LittleMiss1565.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Little Miss 1565]]The best-known victim of the circus fire was a young blonde girl wearing a white dress. She is known only as \"Little Miss 1565\", named after the number assigned to her body at the city's makeshift [[morgue]]. Oddly well preserved even after her death, her face has become arguably the most familiar image of the fire.\n\nHer true identity has been a topic of debate and frustration in the Hartford area since the fire occurred. She was buried without a name in Hartford's Northwood cemetery, where a victims' memorial also stands. Two police investigators, Sgts. Thomas Barber and Edward Lowe, photographed her and took fingerprints, footprints, and dental charts. Despite massive publicity and repeated displays of the famous photograph in nationwide magazines, she was never claimed. Barber and Lowe spent the rest of their lives trying to identify her. They decorated her grave with flowers each Christmas, [[Memorial Day]], and July 4.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=_E0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA11&lpg=PA11&dq=%22Thomas+Barber%22+Little+Miss+1565&source=bl&ots=clluxNhTD6&sig=0Rb21HaK2bP19v1y1QQrr0CiG1M&hl=en&ei=VJgBTNbhL4TWNoWPgDs&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CBkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false A Man's Tender Search for a Name for Little Miss 1565].

Davey also contends that there was a conspiracy within the judicial system to convict the Ringling defendants, and that Segee was the arsonist. Before writing the book, Davey spent six years researching the case and conducting his own experiments as to how the fire really may have started. He described the original investigation both \"flawed and primitive\", though he did not work on the original case. Eleanor's brother Donald Cook had contacted authorities in 1955 insisting that the girl was his sister, but nothing came of it,<ref name=\"Cohn, p. 17\"/> and Donald later worked with Davey to establish her identity.

Found May 29, 2010.</ref>\n\n===Ongoing questions===\nVarious assertions put forth in ''A Matter of Degree'' have been fiercely disputed by investigators who worked on the case, as well as by other writers, most notably [[Stewart O'Nan]], who published ''The Circus Fire: A True Story of an American Tragedy'' in 2001. O'Nan points to the fact that Little Miss 1565 had blonde hair, while Eleanor Cook was a brunette. The shape of Little Miss 1565's face and that of Eleanor Cook are dissimilar, and the heights and ages of the two girls do not match up.\n\nPerhaps most significantly, when shown a photograph of Little Miss 1565, Eleanor's mother Mildred Corintha Parsons Cook immediately stated that this was not her daughter. She firmly maintained that stance until her death in 1997, age 91. Badly injured in the fire, Mrs. Cook had been unable to claim her two dead children, and was too emotionally traumatized to pursue it later. She had been told that Eleanor was not in any of the locations where bodies were kept for identification. She believed that Eleanor was one of two children who had been burnt beyond recognition and remain unidentified. O'Nan thinks she may be body number 1503. He further points to the differences in the [[Forensic dentistry|dental records]] of Eleanor Cook and the records made of Little Miss 1565 after her death.\n\nAs O'Nan and others have pointed out, the most likely scenario is that a family claiming a body early on mistakenly identified Eleanor Cook as their own child and she is buried under that child's name. Even when \"Little Miss 1565's\" picture ran in the papers, they failed to recognize her as their own due to their desire to put the traumatic event behind them. While DNA analysis could end this debate definitively, the logistics of exhuming all the likely candidates for this mix-up make this unlikely.\n\nWith the questions over whether Eleanor Cook is the true identity of Little Miss 1565 still unanswered in the eyes of many, the body was exhumed after the release of ''A Matter of Degree'' and buried in [[Southampton, Massachusetts]], next to the body of Edward Cook, the brother of Eleanor Cook and a victim of the circus fire himself. In 1992, her [[death certificate]] was officially changed from the previous identification of \"1565\". Since then, the Cook family has raised questions about whether the body is indeed that of Eleanor Cook, and some investigators have come to believe Eleanor's body may have been another of the unclaimed bodies from the fire and not Little Miss 1565.\n\n==Personal accounts==\nOne of the survivors of the fire, Maureen Krekian, discussed her ordeal in 2007. She was 11 at the time of the fire, and lived on the same road where the circus was held. On the day of the event, she was supposed to go to the circus with a woman next door and her daughter. When she went to their house, she found that they had already left without her. She decided to go to the circus on her own, where she seated herself in the bleachers.<ref name=\"krekian\">\"[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=11768511 Remembering the Horror and Heroes of a Circus Fire]\".

And this ball of fire just got bigger and bigger and bigger. By that time, everybody was panicking. The exit was blocked with the cages that the animals were brought in and out with. And there was a man taking kids and flinging them up and over that cage to get them out. I was sitting up in the bleachers and jumped down \u2014 I was three-quarters of the way up.

In a 1997 interview, Reilly said that he rarely attended the theater, despite being a director, since the sound of a large audience in a theater reminded him of the large crowd at the circus before the disaster. He also said during his latter show that his mother, whom he had disobeyed after she told him not to go to the circus on that day with his friend, caught them sneaking out of her sight and scolded them, saying \"I hope it burns to the ground!\"<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ-a4eCFMFc&index=13&list=PL59B9706770CC4F27|title=The Life of Reilly \u2013 13 Hartford Circus Fire|date=July 16, 2010|work=YouTube|accessdate=June 22, 2015}}</ref>\n\nFrieda Pushnik, who performed with the circus as the \"Armless and Legless Wonder\", was rescued by a minstrel show performer.

[[Rogers Hornsby]] (winner of seven NL batting titles), who by 1960 was serving as a scout and coach in the Cubs organization, predicted Williams would someday win a batting title.\n\nWilliams debuted with the Cubs late in the 1959 season and played in a total of 30 games in both the 1959 and 1960 seasons. In 1961, he played in 146 games and was selected as the NL [[MLB Rookie of the Year award|Rookie of the Year]]. That year, he hit 25 home runs and drove in 86 runs. In 1962, 1964, and 1965, he was named an NL All-Star.<ref name=BR>{{cite web|title=Billy Williams Statistics|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/w/willibi01.shtml|publisher=[[Baseball-Reference.com]]|accessdate=September 6, 2013}}</ref> He won the [[Major League Baseball Player of the Month Award|NL Player of the Month Award]] in May 1964 with a .455 average, 8 HR, and 22 RBI. Williams struggled defensively in the first few years of his career, leading NL outfielders in errors as a rookie. By the mid-1960s, his defense was no longer seen as a serious weakness.<ref name=SABR/> He would return to the All-Star Game in 1968, 1972, and 1973.<ref name=BR/> \n\nIn each season from 1961 to 1973, Williams hit at least 20 home runs and drove in 84 or more runs. His batting swing was smooth and efficient, with quick wrist action that allowed him to hit for both average and power despite his slender frame. Early in his career, this earned him the nickname \"Sweet-Swinging Billy Williams,\" sometimes shortened to \"Sweet Williams\" or \"Sweet Billy\". His nickname was later referenced in the subtitle of his autobiography. He was also nicknamed \"Sweet-Swinging Billy from Whistler,\" in reference to his birthplace in Alabama. His home run feats included 3 homers in one game and 5 homers in 2 consecutive games. Twice in one season, Williams belted 4 extra-base hits in a game.\n\nIn 1970, Williams batted .322 with 42 homers and 129 RBI and finished second in National League Most Valuable Player voting; surprisingly, despite batting .319 with 26 HR and 80 RBI at the All-Star break, he was left off the All-Star team. Williams set a [[National League]] record for consecutive games played with 1,117 from 1963 to 1970 (this record was later eclipsed by [[Steve Garvey]] with 1,207 games played from 1975 to 1983).

[[Buck O'Neil]], the Cubs scout who had originally discovered Williams, was dispatched to Whistler, and he persuaded Williams to return to the team.<ref>Williams, p. 8-11.</ref> During the 1959 season, he advanced to the Class AAA [[Fort Worth Cats]] and even played 18 games for the Cubs.<ref name=BR/><ref name=BRMinors/> In 1960, he hit 26 home runs for the Class AAA [[Houston Buffs]] and played in 12 major league games.<ref name=BR/><ref name=BRMinors/>\n\n==MLB career==\n\n===Chicago Cubs===\n[[File:Billy Williams 1964.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Williams in 1964]] Williams joined a Chicago Cubs team that by the early 1960s would feature stars such as [[Ernie Banks]], [[Ferguson Jenkins]], and [[Ron Santo]]. [[Rogers Hornsby]] (winner of seven NL batting titles), who by 1960 was serving as a scout and coach in the Cubs organization, predicted Williams would someday win a batting title.\n\nWilliams debuted with the Cubs late in the 1959 season and played in a total of 30 games in both the 1959 and 1960 seasons. In 1961, he played in 146 games and was selected as the NL [[MLB Rookie of the Year award|Rookie of the Year]]. That year, he hit 25 home runs and drove in 86 runs. In 1962, 1964, and 1965, he was named an NL All-Star.<ref name=BR>{{cite web|title=Billy Williams Statistics|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/w/willibi01.shtml|publisher=[[Baseball-Reference.com]]|accessdate=September 6, 2013}}</ref> He won the [[Major League Baseball Player of the Month Award|NL Player of the Month Award]] in May 1964 with a .455 average, 8 HR, and 22 RBI. Williams struggled defensively in the first few years of his career, leading NL outfielders in errors as a rookie. By the mid-1960s, his defense was no longer seen as a serious weakness.<ref name=SABR/> He would return to the All-Star Game in 1968, 1972, and 1973.<ref name=BR/> \n\nIn each season from 1961 to 1973, Williams hit at least 20 home runs and drove in 84 or more runs. His batting swing was smooth and efficient, with quick wrist action that allowed him to hit for both average and power despite his slender frame. Early in his career, this earned him the nickname \"Sweet-Swinging Billy Williams,\" sometimes shortened to \"Sweet Williams\" or \"Sweet Billy\". His nickname was later referenced in the subtitle of his autobiography. He was also nicknamed \"Sweet-Swinging Billy from Whistler,\" in reference to his birthplace in Alabama. His home run feats included 3 homers in one game and 5 homers in 2 consecutive games. Twice in one season, Williams belted 4 extra-base hits in a game.\n\nIn 1970, Williams batted .322 with 42 homers and 129 RBI and finished second in National League Most Valuable Player voting; surprisingly, despite batting .319 with 26 HR and 80 RBI at the All-Star break, he was left off the All-Star team. Williams set a [[National League]] record for consecutive games played with 1,117 from 1963 to 1970 (this record was later eclipsed by [[Steve Garvey]] with 1,207 games played from 1975 to 1983). As his consecutive games streak began to accumulate, he was dubbed \"Iron Man\" by some writers.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://books.google.com/?id=9gJZctGWIVMC&pg=PA50&lpg=PA50&dq=%22billy+williams%22+%22iron+man%22#v=onepage&q=%22billy%20williams%22%20%22iron%20man%22&f=false |title = Ebony|publisher = Johnson Publishing Company|date = July 1967}}</ref> He co-authored a 1970 book called ''Iron Man''.[https://openlibrary.org/b/OL5077239M/Iron_man] In 1972, he was the National League batting champion and named the Major League Player of the Year by ''The Sporting News''.<ref>''Cooperstown: Where the Legends Live Forever'', by Lowell Reidenbaugh, edited by Joe Hoppel, and compiled by the Editors of ''The Sporting News''.

Following his departure from the Cubs, the number was reassigned to other players from time to time, most notably [[Larry Biittner]]; Williams reclaimed it during several intervals of coaching with the Cubs after his playing days had ended.\n\n[[Image:Williams-Sandberg retired numbers.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Retired number 26 at [[Wrigley Field]]]] In 1999, he was selected to the Cubs All-Century Team and was named as one of 100 finalists to the [[Major League Baseball All-Century Team]]. During the 2010 season, the Cubs honored Williams with a statue outside [[Wrigley Field]] in Chicago. The statue was unveiled in a pre-game ceremony before their home game on September 7 against the [[Houston Astros]].<ref>http://archive.chicagobreakingsports.com/2010/09/billy-williams-statue-unveiled-during-ceremonies.html{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, Williams was appointed as a member of the National Baseball Hall of Fame's 16-member [[Golden Era Committee]] (replacing the [[Veterans Committee]]), which considers ten Golden Era candidates every three years for the Hall of Fame.
