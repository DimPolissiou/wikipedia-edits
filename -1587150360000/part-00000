The tournament was open to all players who had a [[List of players with a 2020 PDC Tour Card|PDC Tour Card in 2020]].<ref>https://www.pdc.tv/darts-pdc-home-tour-launch-live-sport</ref>\n\n==Format==\nBeginning on 17 April 2020, four Tour Card players would play against each other over the course of an evening, with the winner of each night going into a last 32 stage, beginning on 19 May 2020.<ref>https://www.pdc.tv/darts-live-sport-pdc-home-tour-lineup-fixtures-nights-one-to-four</ref>\n\nEach match will be a best of 9 legs match, with the winner of each match getting two points on the table. Should there be a tie on points after all the matches, the leg difference will determine the winner, should that also be equal, the result between the two players is taken into account. Should there be a three-way tie for first place, the overall average of the players will then be taken into account.\n\n==Darts At Home==\nWhilst the format was being finalised, there were 2 weeks of matches under the banner '''Darts At Home''', which followed the same rules as the new PDC Home Tour, although the first week featured 5 players (in best-of-7 leg matches), as opposed to the 4 (in best-of-9 leg matches) which was then adopted later on.\n\n''All matches first to 4 (best-of-7 legs)''\n\nNB: P = Played;

Should there be a tie on points after all the matches, the leg difference will determine the winner, should that also be equal, the result between the two players is taken into account.

One of its earliest industries was boat building for settlers of the [[Ohio Country]]. In 1784, Thomas Viceroy completed a town plan which was approved by the Penn family attorney.

By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing significant quantities of iron, brass, tin, and glass. On March 18, 1816, the 46-year-old local government became a city. It was served by numerous river steamboats, that increased trading traffic on the rivers.\n\nIn the 1830s, many [[Welsh people]] from the [[Merthyr]] steelworks immigrated to the city following the aftermath of the [[Merthyr Rising]]. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the [[Allegheny Mountains]]. The [[Great Fire of Pittsburgh]] destroyed over a thousand buildings in 1845. The city rebuilt with the aid of Irish immigrants who came to escape the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]]. By 1857, Pittsburgh's 1,000 factories were consuming 22 million coal bushels yearly. Coal mining and iron manufacturing attracted waves of European immigrants to the area, the most came from Germany.\n\n[[File:Pittsburgh 1874 Otto Krebs.jpg|thumb|Pittsburgh in 1874, by Otto Krebs]]\nWhile Pennsylvania had been established as a free state after the Revolution, enslaved African Americans sought freedom here through escape as refugees from the South, or occasionally fleeing from travelers they were serving who stayed in the city. There were active stations of the [[Underground Railroad]] in the city, and numerous refugees were documented as getting help from station agents and African-American workers in city hotels. The Drennen Slave Girl walked out of the Monongahela House in 1850, apparently to freedom.<ref name=\"freedom\">William J.

Many slaves left the city and county for Canada after Congress passed the 1850 [[Fugitive Slave Act]], as it required cooperation from law enforcement even in free states and increased penalties. From 1850 to 1860, the black population in Allegheny County dropped from 3,431 to 2,725 as people headed to more safety in Canada.<ref name=\"freedom\"/>\n\n[[File:Harpers 8 11 1877 Destruction of the Union Depot.jpg|thumb|right|Burning of Union Depot, Pittsburgh, during the [[Pittsburgh railroad strike of 1877]]]]\nThe [[American Civil War]] boosted the city's economy with increased iron and armament demand by the Union. [[Andrew Carnegie]] began steel production in 1875 at the [[Edgar Thomson Steel Works]] in [[North Braddock, Pennsylvania]], which evolved into the [[Carnegie Steel Company]]. He adopted the [[Bessemer process]] to increase production. Manufacturing was key to growth of Pittsburgh and the surrounding region. Railroad lines were built into the city along both rivers, increasing transportation access to important markets.\n\n===1900 to present===\n[[File:Pittsburgh 1904.jpg|thumb|Pittsburgh in 1903]]\nIn 1901, [[J.

The \"Renaissance II\" project followed in 1977, focused on cultural and neighborhood development. The industrial base continued to expand through the 1970s, but beginning in the early 1980s both the area's steel and electronics industries imploded during national industrial restructuring. There were massive layoffs from mill and plant closures.<ref name=\"diaspora\"/>\n\nIn the later 20th century, the area shifted its economic base to education, tourism, and services, largely based on healthcare/medicine, finance, and high technology such as robotics. Although Pittsburgh successfully shifted its economy and remained viable, the city's population has never rebounded to its industrial-era highs. While 680,000 people lived in the city proper in 1950, a combination of suburbanization and economic turbulence resulted in a decrease in city population, even as the metropolitan area population increased again.\n\nDuring the [[late 2000s recession]], Pittsburgh was economically strong, adding jobs when most cities were losing them.

One of its earliest industries was boat building for settlers of the [[Ohio Country]]. In 1784, Thomas Viceroy completed a town plan which was approved by the Penn family attorney. Pittsburgh became a possession of Pennsylvania in 1785. The following year, the [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] was started, and in 1787, the [[University of Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh Academy]] was chartered. Unrest during the [[Whiskey Rebellion]] of 1794 resulted in federal troops being sent to the area. By 1797, glass manufacture began, while the population grew to around 1,400.

By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing significant quantities of iron, brass, tin, and glass. On March 18, 1816, the 46-year-old local government became a city. It was served by numerous river steamboats, that increased trading traffic on the rivers.\n\nIn the 1830s, many [[Welsh people]] from the [[Merthyr]] steelworks immigrated to the city following the aftermath of the [[Merthyr Rising]]. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the [[Allegheny Mountains]]. The [[Great Fire of Pittsburgh]] destroyed over a thousand buildings in 1845. The city rebuilt with the aid of Irish immigrants who came to escape the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]]. By 1857, Pittsburgh's 1,000 factories were consuming 22 million coal bushels yearly. Coal mining and iron manufacturing attracted waves of European immigrants to the area, the most came from Germany.\n\n[[File:Pittsburgh 1874 Otto Krebs.jpg|thumb|Pittsburgh in 1874, by Otto Krebs]]\nWhile Pennsylvania had been established as a free state after the Revolution, enslaved African Americans sought freedom here through escape as refugees from the South, or occasionally fleeing from travelers they were serving who stayed in the city. There were active stations of the [[Underground Railroad]] in the city, and numerous refugees were documented as getting help from station agents and African-American workers in city hotels.

[[Andrew Carnegie]] began steel production in 1875 at the [[Edgar Thomson Steel Works]] in [[North Braddock, Pennsylvania]], which evolved into the [[Carnegie Steel Company]]. He adopted the [[Bessemer process]] to increase production. Manufacturing was key to growth of Pittsburgh and the surrounding region.

The \"Renaissance II\" project followed in 1977, focused on cultural and neighborhood development. The industrial base continued to expand through the 1970s, but beginning in the early 1980s both the area's steel and electronics industries imploded during national industrial restructuring.

Although Pittsburgh successfully shifted its economy and remained viable, the city's population has never rebounded to its industrial-era highs. While 680,000 people lived in the city proper in 1950, a combination of suburbanization and economic turbulence resulted in a decrease in city population, even as the metropolitan area population increased again.\n\nDuring the [[late 2000s recession]], Pittsburgh was economically strong, adding jobs when most cities were losing them.

Besides the black body and white forehead, a distinctive light blue, narrow patch of feathers covers the lower back-upper rump; a further distinctive color of this bird are bright sulphur-yellow breast patches. The bird has black legs, and dark eyes. The species is [[Sexual dimorphism|dimorphic]] with the female's colors being grayish and black with the sulphur-yellow belly; she has a white eye-ring.\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nIt is found in the Atlantic coastal Guianas and the eastern [[Guiana Shield]] of [[Surname]] and [[French Guiana]]; also regions of [[Guyana]] and the northeastern Amazon states of [[Brazil]]. Its natural [[habitat]] is [[subtropical or tropical moist lowland forest]].\n\nThe range of the white-fronted manakin is in the eastern [[Guianas]], (only southeast border region of Guyana in the center-west of range), and the northeastern [[Amazon Basin]]; specifically, the eastern half of its range is all of Brazil's northeastern state of [[Amap\u00e1]], with Amap\u00e1's south-flowing [[Jari River]] the centerline of its range. The range approaches the [[Amazon River]] but avoids the Amazon River [[wildlife corridor|corridor]] by about 100&nbsp;km; further upstream its range is on the Amazon River, its north bank for 500&nbsp;km, starting at the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]] confluence and downriver past the confluence of the [[Madeira River]]. This portion of the range covers nearly all of the northern part of [[Par\u00e1]] state, north of the Amazon River. The species is not found south of the Amazon River into the southeast Amazon Basin.\n\nThe [[Geographic contiguity|contiguous]] range in the Guianas, in the east encompasses all of French Guiana, and in the center country of Suriname, divides the country diagonally, being found in the southeast parts bordering French Guiana. Some disjunct locale areas of Guyana besides the southeast continuous range occur in Guyana's southwest at the headwaters of the [[Essequibo River]] and the Guiana Shield.<!--see the RangeMap at \"www.natureserve.org(then 'InfoNatura')-->\n\n==Status==\nThis bird has a very wide range, is fairly common and is presumed to have a large total population.

All four gaits are seen in wild horse populations. While other intermediate speed gaits may occur naturally to some horses, these four basic gaits occur in nature across almost all horse breeds.<ref name=HandH65/> In some animals the trot is replaced by the pace or an [[ambling]] gait.<ref name=HorseGaits32/> Horses who possess an ambling gait are usually also able to trot.\n\n{{See also|Terrestrial locomotion|Gait}}\n\n==Walk==\n[[Image:Muybridge horse walking animated.gif|thumb|The walk, a four-beat gait]]\n\nThe walk is a four-beat gait that averages about {{convert|7|km/h}}. When walking, a horse's legs follow this sequence: left hind leg, left front leg, right hind leg, right front leg, in a regular 1-2-3-4 beat. At the walk, the horse will alternate between having three or two feet on the ground. A horse moves its head and neck in a slight up and down motion that helps maintain balance.<ref name=Harris33>Harris, Susan E. ''Horse Gaits, Balance and Movement'' New York: Howell Book House 1993 {{ISBN|0-87605-955-8}} pp. 32\u201333</ref>\n\nIn detail, suppose the horse starts by lifting its left front leg (the other three feet are touching the ground). It then lifts its right hind leg (while being supported by the diagonal pair front right and left hind). Next, the left front foot touches the ground (the horse is now supported by all but the right hind leg); then the horse lifts its right front leg (it is now supported laterally on both left legs), and shortly afterwards it sets down the right rear leg (only the front right leg is now lifted). Then it lifts its left rear leg (diagonal support), puts down the front right (lateral support), lifts the left front, puts down the rear left, and the pattern repeats.\n\nIdeally, the advancing rear hoof oversteps the spot where the previously advancing front hoof touched the ground. The more the rear hoof oversteps, the smoother and more comfortable the walk becomes. Individual horses and different [[List of horse breeds|breeds]] vary in the smoothness of their walk. However, a rider will almost always feel some degree of gentle side-to-side motion in the horse's hips as each hind leg reaches forward.\n\nThe fastest \"walks\" with a four-beat footfall pattern are actually the lateral forms of [[ambling]] gaits such as the running walk, singlefoot, and similar rapid but smooth intermediate speed gaits.  If a horse begins to speed up and lose a regular four-beat cadence to its gait, the horse is no longer walking, but is beginning to either [[Horse gait#Trot|trot]] or pace.\n\n==Trot==\n[[Image:Trot.jpg|thumb|right|The trot, a two-beat gait involving diagonal pairs of legs. The two legs with white stockings are off the ground.]]\n{{Main|Trot (horse gait)}}\n\nThe trot is a two-beat gait that has a wide variation in possible speeds, but averages about {{convert|13|km/h|mph}}. A very slow trot is sometimes referred to as a jog. An extremely fast trot has no special name, but in [[harness racing]], the trot of a [[Standardbred]] is faster than the gallop of the average non-[[horse racing|racehorse]].<ref name=Harris35>Harris, Susan E. ''Horse Gaits, Balance and Movement'' New York: Howell Book House 1993 {{ISBN|0-87605-955-8}} pp. 35\u201337</ref>  The North American speed record for a racing trot under saddle was measured at {{convert|48.68|km/h|mph}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paulickreport.com/news/people/chantal-rides-trotter-to-north-american-record/|title=Chantal Rides Trotter to North American Record \u2013 Horse Racing News \u2013 Paulick Report|website=www.paulickreport.com}}</ref>\n\nIn this gait, the horse moves its legs in unison in diagonal pairs. From the standpoint of the balance of the horse, this is a very stable gait, and the horse need not make major balancing motions with its head and neck.<ref name=Harris35/>\n\nThe trot is the working gait for a horse. Despite what one sees in movies, horses can only canter and gallop for short periods at a time, after which they need time to rest and recover. Horses in good condition can maintain a working trot for hours. The trot is the main way horses travel quickly from one place to the next.\n\n[[File:A may morning in the park thomas eakins.jpeg|left|thumbnail|[[The Fairman Rogers Four-in-Hand]] (1879\u201380) by [[Thomas Eakins]], was the first painting to demonstrate precisely how horses move based on systematic photographic analysis. Eakins based these on [[Eadweard Muybridge]]'s 1878 photographs of the trotter \"Abe Edgington\".]]\nDepending on the horse and its speed, a trot can be difficult for a rider to sit because the body of the horse drops a bit between beats and bounces up again when the next set of legs strike the ground. Each time another diagonal pair of legs hits the ground, the rider can be jolted upwards out of the saddle and meet the horse with some force on the way back down. Therefore, at most speeds above a jog, especially in [[English riding]] disciplines, most riders ''post''  to the trot, rising up and down in rhythm with the horse to avoid being jolted. Posting is easy on the horse's back, and once mastered is also easy on the rider.<ref name=Harris35/>\n\nTo not be jostled out of the saddle and to not harm the horse by bouncing on its back, riders must learn specific skills in order to sit the trot. Most riders can easily learn to sit a slow jog trot without bouncing. A skilled rider can ride even a powerfully extended trot without bouncing, but to do so requires well-conditioned back and abdominal muscles, and to do so for long periods is tiring for even experienced riders. A fast, uncollected, racing trot, such as that of the harness racing horse, is virtually impossible to sit.\n\nBecause the trot is such a safe and efficient gait for a horse, learning to ride the trot correctly is an important component in almost all [[equestrianism|equestrian]] disciplines. Nonetheless, \"gaited\" or \"ambling\" horses that possess smooth 4-beat intermediate gaits that replace or supplement the trot (see \"[[#\"Ambling\" gaits|ambling gaits]]\" below) are popular with riders who prefer for various reasons not to have to ride at a trot.\n\nTwo variations of the trot are specially trained in advanced [[dressage]] horses: the [[Piaffe]] and the [[Passage (dressage)|Passage]]. The Piaffe is essentially created by asking the horse to trot in place, with very little forward motion. The Passage is an exaggerated slow motion trot. Both require tremendous collection, careful training and considerable physical conditioning for a horse to perform.<ref name=Harris39>Harris, Susan E. ''Horse Gaits, Balance and Movement'' New York: Howell Book House 1993 {{ISBN|0-87605-955-8}} p. 39</ref>\n\n==Canter and gallop==\n{{Main|Canter and gallop}}\n\n[[Image:Andalusier 3 - galoppierend.jpg|thumb|right|An [[Andalusian horse|Andalusian]] performing the canter. The left hind and right fore will land at the same moment, creating three beats in the stride. This horse is on the left lead, as the left rear and right fore are moving together, with the left hind leading the right hind. As the left fore lands, it will be in front of the right fore.]]\n\n===Canter===\nThe canter is a controlled, three-beat gait that is usually a bit faster than the average trot, but slower than the gallop. The average speed of a canter is 16\u201327&nbsp;km/h (10\u201317&nbsp;mph), depending on the length of the stride of the horse. Listening to a horse canter, one can usually hear the three beats as though a drum had been struck three times in succession. Then there is a rest, and immediately afterwards the three-beat occurs again. The faster the horse is moving, the longer the suspension time between the three beats.<ref name=Harris42>Harris, Susan E. ''Horse Gaits, Balance and Movement'' New York: Howell Book House 1993 {{ISBN|0-87605-955-8}} pp. 42\u201344</ref>  The word is thought to be short for \"[[Canterbury gallop]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=gallop&searchmode=none|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}}</ref>\n\nIn the canter, one of the horse's rear legs &ndash; the right rear leg, for example &ndash; propels the horse forward. During this beat, the horse is supported only on that single leg while the remaining three legs are moving forward. On the next beat the horse catches itself on the left rear and right front legs while the other hind leg is still momentarily on the ground. On the third beat, the horse catches itself on the left front leg while the diagonal pair is momentarily still in contact with the ground.<ref name=Harris42/>\n\nThe more extended foreleg is matched by a slightly more extended hind leg on the same side. This is referred to as a \"lead\". Except in special cases, such as the counter-canter, it is desirable for a horse to lead with its inside legs when on a circle. Therefore, a horse that begins cantering with the right rear leg as described above will have the left front and hind legs each land farther forward. This would be referred to as being on the \"left lead\".<ref name=Harris42/>\n\nWhen a rider is added to the horse's natural balance, the question of the lead becomes more important. When riding in an enclosed area such as an arena, the correct lead provides the horse with better balance. The rider typically signals the horse which lead to take when moving from a slower gait into the canter. In addition, when jumping over fences, the rider typically signals the horse to land on the correct lead to approach the next fence or turn. The rider can also request the horse to deliberately take up the wrong lead (counter-canter), a move required in some [[dressage]] competitions and routine in [[polo]], which requires a degree of collection and balance in the horse. The switch from one lead to another without breaking gait is called the \"flying lead change\" or \"[[flying change]]\". This switch is also a feature of dressage and [[reining]] schooling and competition.\n\nIf a horse is leading with one front foot but the opposite hind foot, it produces an awkward rolling movement, called a cross-canter, disunited canter or \"cross-firing\".\n\nThe lope is another term for the canter, used in western U.S.A.\n\n{{See also|lead (leg)|lead change}}\n\n===Gallop===<!-- This section is linked from [[Horse]] and [[Lead change]] -->\n[[Image:Horse-racing-3.jpg|thumb|The suspension phase, seen in the canter and the gallop]]\n[[Image:Muybridge race horse animated.gif|thumb|In motion]]\n[[Image:Jean Louis Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault 001.jpg|thumb|''Le derby d'Epsom'', painting by [[Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault]], 1821]]\n\nThe gallop is very much like the canter, except that it is faster, more ground-covering, and the three-beat canter changes to a four-beat gait. It is the fastest gait of the horse, averaging about {{convert|40|to|48|km/h}}, and in the wild is used when the animal needs to flee from [[predation|predators]] or simply cover short distances quickly. Horses seldom will gallop more than {{convert|1.5|or|3|km}} before they need to rest, though horses can sustain a moderately paced gallop for longer distances before they become winded and have to slow down.<ref name=Harris47>Harris, Susan E.

Then both gaits end with the striking off of the leading leg, followed by a moment of suspension when all four feet are off the ground. A careful listener or observer can tell an extended canter from a gallop by the presence of the fourth beat.<ref name=Harris47/>\n\nContrary to the old \"classic\" paintings of running horses, which showed all four legs stretched out in the suspension phase, when the legs are stretched out, at least one foot is still in contact with the ground. When all four feet are off the ground in the suspension phase of the gallop, the legs are bent rather than extended.\n\nIn 1877, [[Leland Stanford]] settled an argument about whether racehorses were ever fully airborne: he paid photographer [[Eadweard Muybridge]] to prove it photographically. The resulting photos, known as ''[[The Horse in Motion]]'', were the first documented example of high-speed photography and they clearly showed the horse airborne.\n[[File:Muybridge horse gallop.jpg|thumb|Stills of the Muybridge sequence; images 7 and 8 show the suspension phase, the second from the last image show the broken strike sequence of the inside hind and outside fore feet]]\nAccording to [[Equix]], who analyzed the [[biometrics]] of racing thoroughbreds, the average racing colt has a stride length of {{convert|24.6|ft}}; that of [[Secretariat (horse)|Secretariat]], for instance, was {{convert|24.8|ft}}, which was probably part of his success.\n\nA controlled gallop used to show a horse's ground-covering stride in [[horse show]] competition is called a \"gallop in hand\" or a ''hand gallop''.<ref name=Harris47/>\n\nIn complete contrast to the suspended phase of a gallop, when a horse jumps over a fence, the legs are stretched out while in the air, and the front legs hit the ground before the hind legs. Essentially, the horse takes the first two steps of a galloping stride on the take-off side of the fence, and the other two steps on the landing side. A horse has to collect its hindquarters after a jump to strike off into the next stride.<ref name=Harris57>Harris, Susan E.

In the pace, the two legs on the same side of the horse move forward together, unlike the trot, where the two legs diagonally opposite from each other move forward together. In both the pace and the trot, two feet are always off the ground. The trot is much more common, but some horses, particularly in breeds bred for [[harness racing]], naturally prefer to pace. Pacers are also faster than trotters on the average, though horses are raced at both gaits. Among [[Standardbred horse]]s, pacers breed truer than trotters \u2013 that is, trotting sires have a higher proportion of pacers among their get than pacing sires do of trotters.<ref name=Harris50>Harris, Susan E. ''Horse Gaits, Balance and Movement'' New York: Howell Book House 1993 {{ISBN|0-87605-955-8}} p. 50</ref>\n\nA slow pace can be relatively comfortable, as the rider is lightly rocked from side to side. A slightly uneven pace that is somewhat between a pace and an [[ambling|amble]], is the ''sobreandando'' of the [[Peruvian Paso]]. On the other hand, a slow pace is considered undesirable in an Icelandic horse, where it is called a ''lull'' or a \"piggy-pace\".\n\nWith one exception, a fast pace is uncomfortable for riding and very difficult to sit, because the rider is moved rapidly from side to side. The motion feels somewhat as if the rider is on a [[camel]], another animal that naturally paces. However, a camel is much taller than a horse and so even at relatively fast speeds, a rider can follow the rocking motion of a camel. A pacing horse, being smaller and taking quicker steps, moves from side to side at a rate that becomes difficult for a rider to follow at speed, so though the gait is faster and useful for harness racing, it becomes impractical as a gait for riding at speed over long distances. However, in the case of the [[Icelandic horse]], where the pace is known as the ''skei\u00f0,'' \"flying pace\" or ''flugskei\u00f0'', it is a smooth and highly valued gait, ridden in short bursts at great speed.\n\nA horse that paces and is not used in harness is often taught to perform some form of [[ambling|amble]], obtained by lightly unbalancing the horse so the footfalls of the pace break up into a four beat lateral gait that is smoother to ride. A rider cannot properly post to a pacing horse because there is no diagonal gait pattern to follow, though some riders attempt to avoid jostling by rhythmically rising and sitting.\n\nBased on studies of the Icelandic horse, it is possible that the pace may be heritable and linked to a single genetic mutation on DMRT3 in the same manner as the lateral ambling gaits.<ref name=\"Nature\"/>\n\n==\"Ambling\" gaits==\n{{Main|Ambling}}\n[[Image:T\u00f6lt.jpg|thumb|[[Icelandic horse]] at the t\u00f6lt]]\n[[Image:RunningWalk.jpg|right|thumb|[[Tennessee Walking Horse]] at the running walk]]\n[[Image:2009 Worlds Championship Horse Show (3877971589).jpg|right|thumb|[[Saddlebred]] performing the rack]]\nThere are a significant number of names for various four-beat intermediate gaits. Though these names derive from differences in footfall patterns and speed, historically they were once grouped together and collectively referred to as the \"amble\".  In the [[United States]] horses that are able to amble are referred to as \"gaited\".<ref name=Harris51>Harris, Susan E. ''Horse Gaits, Balance and Movement'' New York: Howell Book House 1993 {{ISBN|0-87605-955-8}} pp. 50\u201355</ref>  In almost all cases, the primary feature of the ambling gaits is that 1 of the 4 feet is bearing full weight at any one time, reflected in the colloquial term, \"singlefoot\".\n\nAll ambling gaits are faster than a walk but usually slower than a canter. They are smoother for a rider than either a trot or a pace and most can be sustained for relatively long periods, making them particularly desirable for [[trail riding]] and other tasks where a rider must spend long periods of time in the saddle.\nThere are two basic types: lateral, wherein the front and hind feet on the same side move in sequence, and diagonal, where the front and hind feet on opposite sides move in sequence.<ref>Lieberman, Bobbie. \"Easy-Gaited Horses\". ''Equus'', issue 359, August, 2007, pp. 47\u201351.</ref> Ambling gaits are further distinguished by whether the  footfall rhythm is isochronous, four equal beats in a 1\u20132\u20133\u20134 rhythm; or a non-isochronous 1\u20132, 3\u20134 rhythm created by a slight pause between the groundstrike of the forefoot of one side to the rear of the other.\n\nNot all horses can perform an ambling gait. However, many breeds can be trained to produce them.  In most \"gaited\" breeds, an ambling gait is a [[heredity|hereditary]] trait.  A 2012 [[DNA]] study of movement in [[Icelandic horses]] and mice have determined that a mutation on the gene DMRT3, which is related to limb movement and motion, causes a \"premature '[[stop codon]]'\" in horses with lateral ambling gaits.<ref name=\"Mutation\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=20594|title='Gaited' Gene Mutation and Related Motion Examined  |author= Agricultural Communications, Texas A&M University System|date=5 September 2012|work=The Horse|publisher=Blood-Horse Publications|accessdate=6 September 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"Nature\">{{cite journal|last=Andersson|first=Lisa S|date=30 August 2012|title=Mutations in DMRT3 affect locomotion in horses and spinal circuit function in mice|journal=Nature|volume=488|issue=7413|pages=642\u2013646|doi=10.1038/nature11399|display-authors=etal|pmid=22932389|pmc=3523687}}</ref>\n\nThe major ambling gaits include:\n*The fox trot is most often associated with the [[Missouri Foxtrotter]] breed, but is also seen under different names in other gaited breeds. The fox trot is a four-beat diagonal gait in which the front foot of the diagonal pair lands before the hind.<ref name=HandH68>Ensminger, M. E. ''Horses and Horsemanship'' 6th edition USA: Interstate Publishers 1990 {{ISBN|0-8134-2883-1}} p. 68</ref> The same footfall pattern is characteristic of the ''trocha'', ''pasitrote'' and  ''marcha batida'' seen in various South American breeds.\n* Many South American horse breeds have a range of smooth intermediate lateral ambling gaits. The [[Paso Fino]]'s speed variations are called (from slowest to fastest) the ''paso fino'', ''paso corto'', and ''paso largo''. The [[Peruvian Paso]]'s lateral gaits are known as the ''paso llano''<ref name=Harris51/> and ''sobreandando''.  The lateral gait of the Mangalarga Marchador is called the ''marcha picada.''\n*The rack or racking is a lateral gait most commonly associated with the [[five-gaited]] [[American Saddlebred]]. In the rack, the speed is increased to be approximately that of the pace, but it is a four-beat gait with equal intervals between each beat.<ref name=Harris51/>\n*The running walk, a four-beat lateral gait with footfalls in the same sequence as the regular walk, but characterized by greater speed and smoothness. It is a distinctive natural gait of the [[Tennessee Walking Horse]].<ref name=Harris51/>\n*The slow gait is a general term for various lateral gaits that follow the same general lateral footfall pattern, but the rhythm and collection of the movements are different. Terms for various slow gaits include the ''stepping pace'' and ''singlefoot''.<ref name=Harris51/>\n*The ''t\u00f6lt'' is a gait that is often described as being unique to the [[Icelandic horse]]. The footfall pattern is the same as for the rack, but the t\u00f6lt is characterized by more freedom and liquidity of movement. Some breeds of horses that are related to the Icelandic horse, living in the [[Faroe Islands]] and [[Norway]], also t\u00f6lt.<ref name=Harris51/>\n*The ''revaal'' or ''ravaal'' is a four-beat lateral gait associated with [[Marwari horse|Marwari]], [[Kathiawari (horse)|Kathiawari]] or Sindhi horse breeds of India.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons|Horse gait|Horse gait}}\n*[http://bowlingsite.mcf.com/Movement/locoindex.html Photographs of various horse traits], by [[Eadweard Muybridge]], ''Animals in Motion''\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20051104234721/http://www.ultimatehorsesite.com/info/gaits.html Gaits of the Horse]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060518174452/http://www.eidfaxi.is/fraedsla/eindex.php?fraedsla=gangtegundir Animations of the gaits of the Icelandic horse]\n*[http://iceryder.net/images/dreamteamgaitmap2a.jpg Map detailing the relationship between the gaits of the Icelandic horse]\n*Equix: [https://web.archive.org/web/20061111141512/http://www.equixbio.com/bluegrass.htm Bluegrass Thoroughbred Services], [https://web.archive.org/web/20061111141507/http://www.equixbio.com/greenfield.htm Greenfield Farm] \u2013 videos of walking gaits of various racehorses\n*[http://www.extension.org/pages/Horse_Natural_Gaits Natural Gaits of the Horse from eXtension]\n\n{{Equine}}\n{{locomotion}}\n\n{{short description|Ways of movement of equines}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Horse Gait}}\n[[Category:Horse gaits|*]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=October 2011}}\n\n[[Image:The Horse in Motion high res.jpg|thumb|Animation sequence by [[Eadweard Muybridge]] of a horse in motion]]\n\n[[Horse]]s can use various [[gait]]s (patterns of leg movement) during [[Terrestrial locomotion|locomotion across solid ground]], either naturally or as a result of specialized [[horse training|training]] by humans.<ref name=HandH65>Ensminger, M.

All four gaits are seen in wild horse populations. While other intermediate speed gaits may occur naturally to some horses, these four basic gaits occur in nature across almost all horse breeds.<ref name=HandH65/> In some animals the trot is replaced by the pace or an [[ambling]] gait.<ref name=HorseGaits32/> Horses who possess an ambling gait are usually also able to trot.\n\n{{See also|Terrestrial locomotion|Gait}}\n\n==Walk==\n[[Image:Muybridge horse walking animated.gif|thumb|The walk, a four-beat gait]]\n\nThe walk is a four-beat gait that averages about {{convert|7|km/h}}. When walking, a horse's legs follow this sequence: left hind leg, left front leg, right hind leg, right front leg, in a regular 1-2-3-4 beat. At the walk, the horse will alternate between having three or two feet on the ground. A horse moves its head and neck in a slight up and down motion that helps maintain balance.<ref name=Harris33>Harris, Susan E. ''Horse Gaits, Balance and Movement'' New York: Howell Book House 1993 {{ISBN|0-87605-955-8}} pp. 32\u201333</ref>\n\nIn detail, suppose the horse starts by lifting its left front leg (the other three feet are touching the ground). It then lifts its right hind leg (while being supported by the diagonal pair front right and left hind). Next, the left front foot touches the ground (the horse is now supported by all but the right hind leg); then the horse lifts its right front leg (it is now supported laterally on both left legs), and shortly afterwards it sets down the right rear leg (only the front right leg is now lifted). Then it lifts its left rear leg (diagonal support), puts down the front right (lateral support), lifts the left front, puts down the rear left, and the pattern repeats.\n\nIdeally, the advancing rear hoof oversteps the spot where the previously advancing front hoof touched the ground. The more the rear hoof oversteps, the smoother and more comfortable the walk becomes. Individual horses and different [[List of horse breeds|breeds]] vary in the smoothness of their walk. However, a rider will almost always feel some degree of gentle side-to-side motion in the horse's hips as each hind leg reaches forward.\n\nThe fastest \"walks\" with a four-beat footfall pattern are actually the lateral forms of [[ambling]] gaits such as the running walk, singlefoot, and similar rapid but smooth intermediate speed gaits.  If a horse begins to speed up and lose a regular four-beat cadence to its gait, the horse is no longer walking, but is beginning to either [[Horse gait#Trot|trot]] or pace.\n\n==Trot==\n[[Image:Trot.jpg|thumb|right|The trot, a two-beat gait involving diagonal pairs of legs. The two legs with white stockings are off the ground.]]\n{{Main|Trot (horse gait)}}\n\nThe trot is a two-beat gait that has a wide variation in possible speeds, but averages about {{convert|13|km/h|mph}}. A very slow trot is sometimes referred to as a jog. An extremely fast trot has no special name, but in [[harness racing]], the trot of a [[Standardbred]] is faster than the gallop of the average non-[[horse racing|racehorse]].<ref name=Harris35>Harris, Susan E. ''Horse Gaits, Balance and Movement'' New York: Howell Book House 1993 {{ISBN|0-87605-955-8}} pp. 35\u201337</ref>  The North American speed record for a racing trot under saddle was measured at {{convert|48.68|km/h|mph}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paulickreport.com/news/people/chantal-rides-trotter-to-north-american-record/|title=Chantal Rides Trotter to North American Record \u2013 Horse Racing News \u2013 Paulick Report|website=www.paulickreport.com}}</ref>\n\nIn this gait, the horse moves its legs in unison in diagonal pairs. From the standpoint of the balance of the horse, this is a very stable gait, and the horse need not make major balancing motions with its head and neck.<ref name=Harris35/>\n\nThe trot is the working gait for a horse. Despite what one sees in movies, horses can only canter and gallop for short periods at a time, after which they need time to rest and recover. Horses in good condition can maintain a working trot for hours. The trot is the main way horses travel quickly from one place to the next.\n\n[[File:A may morning in the park thomas eakins.jpeg|left|thumbnail|[[The Fairman Rogers Four-in-Hand]] (1879\u201380) by [[Thomas Eakins]], was the first painting to demonstrate precisely how horses move based on systematic photographic analysis. Eakins based these on [[Eadweard Muybridge]]'s 1878 photographs of the trotter \"Abe Edgington\".]]\nDepending on the horse and its speed, a trot can be difficult for a rider to sit because the body of the horse drops a bit between beats and bounces up again when the next set of legs strike the ground. Each time another diagonal pair of legs hits the ground, the rider can be jolted upwards out of the saddle and meet the horse with some force on the way back down. Therefore, at most speeds above a jog, especially in [[English riding]] disciplines, most riders ''post''  to the trot, rising up and down in rhythm with the horse to avoid being jolted. Posting is easy on the horse's back, and once mastered is also easy on the rider.<ref name=Harris35/>\n\nTo not be jostled out of the saddle and to not harm the horse by bouncing on its back, riders must learn specific skills in order to sit the trot. Most riders can easily learn to sit a slow jog trot without bouncing. A skilled rider can ride even a powerfully extended trot without bouncing, but to do so requires well-conditioned back and abdominal muscles, and to do so for long periods is tiring for even experienced riders. A fast, uncollected, racing trot, such as that of the harness racing horse, is virtually impossible to sit.\n\nBecause the trot is such a safe and efficient gait for a horse, learning to ride the trot correctly is an important component in almost all [[equestrianism|equestrian]] disciplines. Nonetheless, \"gaited\" or \"ambling\" horses that possess smooth 4-beat intermediate gaits that replace or supplement the trot (see \"[[#\"Ambling\" gaits|ambling gaits]]\" below) are popular with riders who prefer for various reasons not to have to ride at a trot.\n\nTwo variations of the trot are specially trained in advanced [[dressage]] horses: the [[Piaffe]] and the [[Passage (dressage)|Passage]]. The Piaffe is essentially created by asking the horse to trot in place, with very little forward motion. The Passage is an exaggerated slow motion trot. Both require tremendous collection, careful training and considerable physical conditioning for a horse to perform.<ref name=Harris39>Harris, Susan E. ''Horse Gaits, Balance and Movement'' New York: Howell Book House 1993 {{ISBN|0-87605-955-8}} p. 39</ref>\n\n==Canter and gallop==\n{{Main|Canter and gallop}}\n\n[[Image:Andalusier 3 - galoppierend.jpg|thumb|right|An [[Andalusian horse|Andalusian]] performing the canter. The left hind and right fore will land at the same moment, creating three beats in the stride. This horse is on the left lead, as the left rear and right fore are moving together, with the left hind leading the right hind. As the left fore lands, it will be in front of the right fore.]]\n\n===Canter===\nThe canter is a controlled, three-beat gait that is usually a bit faster than the average trot, but slower than the gallop. The average speed of a canter is 16\u201327&nbsp;km/h (10\u201317&nbsp;mph), depending on the length of the stride of the horse. Listening to a horse canter, one can usually hear the three beats as though a drum had been struck three times in succession. Then there is a rest, and immediately afterwards the three-beat occurs again. The faster the horse is moving, the longer the suspension time between the three beats.<ref name=Harris42>Harris, Susan E. ''Horse Gaits, Balance and Movement'' New York: Howell Book House 1993 {{ISBN|0-87605-955-8}} pp. 42\u201344</ref>  The word is thought to be short for \"[[Canterbury gallop]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=gallop&searchmode=none|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}}</ref>\n\nIn the canter, one of the horse's rear legs &ndash; the right rear leg, for example &ndash; propels the horse forward. During this beat, the horse is supported only on that single leg while the remaining three legs are moving forward. On the next beat the horse catches itself on the left rear and right front legs while the other hind leg is still momentarily on the ground. On the third beat, the horse catches itself on the left front leg while the diagonal pair is momentarily still in contact with the ground.<ref name=Harris42/>\n\nThe more extended foreleg is matched by a slightly more extended hind leg on the same side. This is referred to as a \"lead\". Except in special cases, such as the counter-canter, it is desirable for a horse to lead with its inside legs when on a circle. Therefore, a horse that begins cantering with the right rear leg as described above will have the left front and hind legs each land farther forward. This would be referred to as being on the \"left lead\".<ref name=Harris42/>\n\nWhen a rider is added to the horse's natural balance, the question of the lead becomes more important. When riding in an enclosed area such as an arena, the correct lead provides the horse with better balance. The rider typically signals the horse which lead to take when moving from a slower gait into the canter. In addition, when jumping over fences, the rider typically signals the horse to land on the correct lead to approach the next fence or turn. The rider can also request the horse to deliberately take up the wrong lead (counter-canter), a move required in some [[dressage]] competitions and routine in [[polo]], which requires a degree of collection and balance in the horse. The switch from one lead to another without breaking gait is called the \"flying lead change\" or \"[[flying change]]\". This switch is also a feature of dressage and [[reining]] schooling and competition.\n\nIf a horse is leading with one front foot but the opposite hind foot, it produces an awkward rolling movement, called a cross-canter, disunited canter or \"cross-firing\".\n\nThe lope is another term for the canter, used in western U.S.A.\n\n{{See also|lead (leg)|lead change}}\n\n===Gallop===<!-- This section is linked from [[Horse]] and [[Lead change]] -->\n[[Image:Horse-racing-3.jpg|thumb|The suspension phase, seen in the canter and the gallop]]\n[[Image:Muybridge race horse animated.gif|thumb|In motion]]\n[[Image:Jean Louis Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault 001.jpg|thumb|''Le derby d'Epsom'', painting by [[Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault]], 1821]]\n\nThe gallop is very much like the canter, except that it is faster, more ground-covering, and the three-beat canter changes to a four-beat gait. It is the fastest gait of the horse, averaging about {{convert|40|to|48|km/h}}, and in the wild is used when the animal needs to flee from [[predation|predators]] or simply cover short distances quickly. Horses seldom will gallop more than {{convert|1.5|or|3|km}} before they need to rest, though horses can sustain a moderately paced gallop for longer distances before they become winded and have to slow down.<ref name=Harris47>Harris, Susan E.

A careful listener or observer can tell an extended canter from a gallop by the presence of the fourth beat.<ref name=Harris47/>\n\nContrary to the old \"classic\" paintings of running horses, which showed all four legs stretched out in the suspension phase, when the legs are stretched out, at least one foot is still in contact with the ground. When all four feet are off the ground in the suspension phase of the gallop, the legs are bent rather than extended.\n\nIn 1877, [[Leland Stanford]] settled an argument about whether racehorses were ever fully airborne: he paid photographer [[Eadweard Muybridge]] to prove it photographically. The resulting photos, known as ''[[The Horse in Motion]]'', were the first documented example of high-speed photography and they clearly showed the horse airborne.\n[[File:Muybridge horse gallop.jpg|thumb|Stills of the Muybridge sequence; images 7 and 8 show the suspension phase, the second from the last image show the broken strike sequence of the inside hind and outside fore feet]]\nAccording to [[Equix]], who analyzed the [[biometrics]] of racing thoroughbreds, the average racing colt has a stride length of {{convert|24.6|ft}}; that of [[Secretariat (horse)|Secretariat]], for instance, was {{convert|24.8|ft}}, which was probably part of his success.\n\nA controlled gallop used to show a horse's ground-covering stride in [[horse show]] competition is called a \"gallop in hand\" or a ''hand gallop''.<ref name=Harris47/>\n\nIn complete contrast to the suspended phase of a gallop, when a horse jumps over a fence, the legs are stretched out while in the air, and the front legs hit the ground before the hind legs. Essentially, the horse takes the first two steps of a galloping stride on the take-off side of the fence, and the other two steps on the landing side. A horse has to collect its hindquarters after a jump to strike off into the next stride.<ref name=Harris57>Harris, Susan E.

In the pace, the two legs on the same side of the horse move forward together, unlike the trot, where the two legs diagonally opposite from each other move forward together. In both the pace and the trot, two feet are always off the ground. The trot is much more common, but some horses, particularly in breeds bred for [[harness racing]], naturally prefer to pace. Pacers are also faster than trotters on the average, though horses are raced at both gaits. Among [[Standardbred horse]]s, pacers breed truer than trotters \u2013 that is, trotting sires have a higher proportion of pacers among their get than pacing sires do of trotters.<ref name=Harris50>Harris, Susan E. ''Horse Gaits, Balance and Movement'' New York: Howell Book House 1993 {{ISBN|0-87605-955-8}} p. 50</ref>\n\nA slow pace can be relatively comfortable, as the rider is lightly rocked from side to side. A slightly uneven pace that is somewhat between a pace and an [[ambling|amble]], is the ''sobreandando'' of the [[Peruvian Paso]]. On the other hand, a slow pace is considered undesirable in an Icelandic horse, where it is called a ''lull'' or a \"piggy-pace\".\n\nWith one exception, a fast pace is uncomfortable for riding and very difficult to sit, because the rider is moved rapidly from side to side. The motion feels somewhat as if the rider is on a [[camel]], another animal that naturally paces. However, a camel is much taller than a horse and so even at relatively fast speeds, a rider can follow the rocking motion of a camel. A pacing horse, being smaller and taking quicker steps, moves from side to side at a rate that becomes difficult for a rider to follow at speed, so though the gait is faster and useful for harness racing, it becomes impractical as a gait for riding at speed over long distances. However, in the case of the [[Icelandic horse]], where the pace is known as the ''skei\u00f0,'' \"flying pace\" or ''flugskei\u00f0'', it is a smooth and highly valued gait, ridden in short bursts at great speed.\n\nA horse that paces and is not used in harness is often taught to perform some form of [[ambling|amble]], obtained by lightly unbalancing the horse so the footfalls of the pace break up into a four beat lateral gait that is smoother to ride. A rider cannot properly post to a pacing horse because there is no diagonal gait pattern to follow, though some riders attempt to avoid jostling by rhythmically rising and sitting.\n\nBased on studies of the Icelandic horse, it is possible that the pace may be heritable and linked to a single genetic mutation on DMRT3 in the same manner as the lateral ambling gaits.<ref name=\"Nature\"/>\n\n==\"Ambling\" gaits==\n{{Main|Ambling}}\n[[Image:T\u00f6lt.jpg|thumb|[[Icelandic horse]] at the t\u00f6lt]]\n[[Image:RunningWalk.jpg|right|thumb|[[Tennessee Walking Horse]] at the running walk]]\n[[Image:2009 Worlds Championship Horse Show (3877971589).jpg|right|thumb|[[Saddlebred]] performing the rack]]\nThere are a significant number of names for various four-beat intermediate gaits. Though these names derive from differences in footfall patterns and speed, historically they were once grouped together and collectively referred to as the \"amble\".  In the [[United States]] horses that are able to amble are referred to as \"gaited\".<ref name=Harris51>Harris, Susan E. ''Horse Gaits, Balance and Movement'' New York: Howell Book House 1993 {{ISBN|0-87605-955-8}} pp. 50\u201355</ref>  In almost all cases, the primary feature of the ambling gaits is that 1 of the 4 feet is bearing full weight at any one time, reflected in the colloquial term, \"singlefoot\".\n\nAll ambling gaits are faster than a walk but usually slower than a canter. They are smoother for a rider than either a trot or a pace and most can be sustained for relatively long periods, making them particularly desirable for [[trail riding]] and other tasks where a rider must spend long periods of time in the saddle.\nThere are two basic types: lateral, wherein the front and hind feet on the same side move in sequence, and diagonal, where the front and hind feet on opposite sides move in sequence.<ref>Lieberman, Bobbie. \"Easy-Gaited Horses\". ''Equus'', issue 359, August, 2007, pp. 47\u201351.</ref> Ambling gaits are further distinguished by whether the  footfall rhythm is isochronous, four equal beats in a 1\u20132\u20133\u20134 rhythm; or a non-isochronous 1\u20132, 3\u20134 rhythm created by a slight pause between the groundstrike of the forefoot of one side to the rear of the other.\n\nNot all horses can perform an ambling gait. However, many breeds can be trained to produce them.  In most \"gaited\" breeds, an ambling gait is a [[heredity|hereditary]] trait.  A 2012 [[DNA]] study of movement in [[Icelandic horses]] and mice have determined that a mutation on the gene DMRT3, which is related to limb movement and motion, causes a \"premature '[[stop codon]]'\" in horses with lateral ambling gaits.<ref name=\"Mutation\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=20594|title='Gaited' Gene Mutation and Related Motion Examined  |author= Agricultural Communications, Texas A&M University System|date=5 September 2012|work=The Horse|publisher=Blood-Horse Publications|accessdate=6 September 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"Nature\">{{cite journal|last=Andersson|first=Lisa S|date=30 August 2012|title=Mutations in DMRT3 affect locomotion in horses and spinal circuit function in mice|journal=Nature|volume=488|issue=7413|pages=642\u2013646|doi=10.1038/nature11399|display-authors=etal|pmid=22932389|pmc=3523687}}</ref>\n\nThe major ambling gaits include:\n*The fox trot is most often associated with the [[Missouri Foxtrotter]] breed, but is also seen under different names in other gaited breeds. The fox trot is a four-beat diagonal gait in which the front foot of the diagonal pair lands before the hind.<ref name=HandH68>Ensminger, M. E. ''Horses and Horsemanship'' 6th edition USA: Interstate Publishers 1990 {{ISBN|0-8134-2883-1}} p. 68</ref> The same footfall pattern is characteristic of the ''trocha'', ''pasitrote'' and  ''marcha batida'' seen in various South American breeds.\n* Many South American horse breeds have a range of smooth intermediate lateral ambling gaits. The [[Paso Fino]]'s speed variations are called (from slowest to fastest) the ''paso fino'', ''paso corto'', and ''paso largo''. The [[Peruvian Paso]]'s lateral gaits are known as the ''paso llano''<ref name=Harris51/> and ''sobreandando''.  The lateral gait of the Mangalarga Marchador is called the ''marcha picada.''\n*The rack or racking is a lateral gait most commonly associated with the [[five-gaited]] [[American Saddlebred]]. In the rack, the speed is increased to be approximately that of the pace, but it is a four-beat gait with equal intervals between each beat.<ref name=Harris51/>\n*The running walk, a four-beat lateral gait with footfalls in the same sequence as the regular walk, but characterized by greater speed and smoothness. It is a distinctive natural gait of the [[Tennessee Walking Horse]].<ref name=Harris51/>\n*The slow gait is a general term for various lateral gaits that follow the same general lateral footfall pattern, but the rhythm and collection of the movements are different. Terms for various slow gaits include the ''stepping pace'' and ''singlefoot''.<ref name=Harris51/>\n*The ''t\u00f6lt'' is a gait that is often described as being unique to the [[Icelandic horse]]. The footfall pattern is the same as for the rack, but the t\u00f6lt is characterized by more freedom and liquidity of movement. Some breeds of horses that are related to the Icelandic horse, living in the [[Faroe Islands]] and [[Norway]], also t\u00f6lt.<ref name=Harris51/>\n*The ''revaal'' or ''ravaal'' is a four-beat lateral gait associated with [[Marwari horse|Marwari]], [[Kathiawari (horse)|Kathiawari]] or Sindhi horse breeds of India.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons|Horse gait|Horse gait}}\n*[http://bowlingsite.mcf.com/Movement/locoindex.html Photographs of various horse traits], by [[Eadweard Muybridge]], ''Animals in Motion''\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20051104234721/http://www.ultimatehorsesite.com/info/gaits.html Gaits of the Horse]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060518174452/http://www.eidfaxi.is/fraedsla/eindex.php?fraedsla=gangtegundir Animations of the gaits of the Icelandic horse]\n*[http://iceryder.net/images/dreamteamgaitmap2a.jpg Map detailing the relationship between the gaits of the Icelandic horse]\n*Equix: [https://web.archive.org/web/20061111141512/http://www.equixbio.com/bluegrass.htm Bluegrass Thoroughbred Services], [https://web.archive.org/web/20061111141507/http://www.equixbio.com/greenfield.htm Greenfield Farm] \u2013 videos of walking gaits of various racehorses\n*[http://www.extension.org/pages/Horse_Natural_Gaits Natural Gaits of the Horse from eXtension]\n\n{{Equine}}\n{{locomotion}}\n\n{{short description|Ways of movement of equines}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Horse Gait}}\n[[Category:Horse gaits|*]]\n", "name_user": "108.195.171.214", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eClassification)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_gait"}

Originally a modified version of the Firestreak, Red Top emerged as a much more capable weapon, with roughly double the range, a more sensitive seeker giving limited all-aspect capability, and an even larger warhead than the already-large one in Firestreak.\n\nRed Top was originally intended to replace Firestreak outright, but carrying the missiles on the [[English Electric Lightning]] required additional area to be added to the Lightning's [[vertical stabilizer]]. For this reason, Firestreak continued to be used on older models of the Lightning, and both missiles passed out of service in 1988 when the last of the Lightnings retired.\n\n==Development==\n===Improved Blue Jay===\nEven before the original [[de Havilland Firestreak|Firestreak]] entered service, improvements were being studied to increase its performance. Still known by its [[rainbow code]] \"Blue Jay\", Blue Jay Mk. II introduced an improved seeker and more powerful motor, Magpie II. Mk. III derated the motor to limit acceleration when launched at high speed in order to avoid overheating due to aerodynamic friction. Neither project was proceeded with.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=35}}\n\n===Blue Vesta===\nLooking for a further improved weapon for the [[Operational Requirement F.155]] interceptors, in 1955 the Air Ministry issued OR.1131 for an all-aspect design capability against enemy aircraft traveling at Mach 2. De Havilland responded with Blue Jay Mk. IV, which was later given its own rainbow code, '''Blue Vesta'''.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=36}}\n\nBlue Vesta adopted the PbTe seeker of Mk. II, further upgrading the motor to the new Magpie III. To handle the aerodynamic heating issues, the fins were made of steel rather than aluminum, and featured cut-away sections to keep the rear portions of the surfaces out of the Mach cones, a feature they referred to as \"mach tips\".{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=36}}{{efn|More widely known today as a cropped delta.}}\n\nWork on Blue Vesta was curtailed after 1956 as the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] (RAE) concluded that the rapid closing speeds of two Mach 2+ aircraft would be so quick that the missile would have no chance to be launched while it was still within the range of its seeker. They suggested moving to the much larger [[radar]]-guided [[Red Hebe]], although some low-level work on Blue Vesta's underlying technologies continued.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=36}}\n\n===Red Top===\nF.155 was canceled in the aftermath of the release of the [[1957 Defence White Paper]]. It was decided to proceed with the development of the [[English Electric Lightning]] largely because it was already close to being complete. Blue Vesta was reactivated in July 1957 to arm this aircraft. For security reasons, yet another rainbow code was assigned in November 1957 and it became Red Top.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=40}}\n\nIn contrast to Blue Vesta, Red Top was a simpler design, more of a rationalised, upgraded version of the earlier Firestreak. Lower launch speeds allowed the steel wings and fins to be abandoned and they were replaced with larger surfaces that provided more maneuvering power. New attachments allowed them to be removed for storage. The fuselage was straightened, removing the boat-tail design of the Firestreak and allowing the new \"Linnet\" rocket motor to more completely fill the increased volume. Other oddities of the Firestreak, like the fin actuators being in the nose and requiring pushrods running the length of the fuselage were removed, giving it a much more logical layout and further increasing internal volume.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=40}}\n\nThe all-aspect [[lead telluride]] (PbTe) seeker developed for Blue Vesta was replaced by a much less expensive [[indium antimonide]] (InSb) system known as \"Violet Banner\". This seeker lacked the sensitivity of the PbTe model and did not offer true all-aspect capability, but it offset this loss to some degree through a greatly increased the [[field of view]] to 60&nbsp;degrees. Firestreak's tube-powered electronics were replaced by [[transistor]]ized versions, which greatly improved reliability and eliminated the need for continual cooling. {{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=41}}\n\nThese changes allowed the warhead to be moved to the forward fuselage from its former rear-mounted location. This move also allowed it to be enlarged to 31&nbsp;kg (68.3&nbsp;lb) from Firestreak's already prodigious 22.7&nbsp;kg (50&nbsp;lb) and added an [[expanding-rod warhead]] in place of the earlier blast fragmentation type. With the warhead moved forward, room was left at the rear of the fuselage for one of the two rows of the IR [[proximity fuse]], improving its view of targets. The new \"Green Garland\" fuse required only one row of smaller rectangular \"windows\", compared to the Firestreak's two rows of larger triangular windows, further simplifying the layout.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=40}}\n\nThe Red Top was faster<ref name=Boyne267>[https://books.google.com/books?id=FW_50wm8VnMC&pg=PA267&lpg=PA267 Boyne, Walter J, ''Air Warfare: an International Encyclopedia, Volume 1''], pub ABC-CLIO Inc, 2002, {{ISBN|1-57607-345-9}} p267.</ref> and had greater range and maneuvrability than the Firestreak, and its [[infrared seeker]] enabled a wider range of engagement angles. Although not offering the true all-aspect capability planned for Blue Vesta, Violet Banner did allow head-on attacks against supersonic aircraft.<ref>[http://www.vectorsite.net/aveeltg.html The English Electric (BAC) Lightning<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  \"Unlike modern [1990s] missiles, Red Top and Firestreak could only be fired outside cloud, and in winter, skies were rarely clear over the UK.\"<ref name=Black141>Black, Ian, ''The Last of the Lightnings'', pub PSL, 1996, {{ISBN|1-85260-541-3}}, p141.</ref>\n\n===Almost cancelled===\nAlthough Red Top was a relatively straightforward upgrade to Firestreak, [[Duncan Sandys]] almost cancelled it as well. He felt that Firestreak would be acceptable during the short period before the [[Bristol Bloodhound|Bloodhound Mk. II]] [[Surface-to-air missile|SAM]] entered service in the early 1960s and eliminated the need for [[interceptor aircraft]] altogether. The [[Air Staff (United Kingdom)|Air Staff]] argued this point, ultimately convincing him that Red Top's head-on attack profile against new Soviet supersonic bombers known to be in development was an urgent requirement.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=41}}\n\nAt a February 1958 meeting of the Controller of Guided Weapons and Electronics, the group earmarked Red Top for both Lightning and the [[Fleet Air Arm]]'s [[de Havilland Sea Vixen]]. It was expected that Red Top would offer a dramatic leap in performance for Sea Vixen, as its enlarged motor significantly improved its performance when launched subsonically, the relative improvement is less when launched from Lightning. There was also some discussion of mounting four Red Top on [[Blackburn Buccaneer]], likely the B.112 version that had been proposed to replace Sea Vixen for long-duration [[combat air patrol]].{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=41}}\n\nIndependently, in 1959 Jon Fozard of [[Hawker Aircraft]] also considered using Red Top on the [[Hawker Siddeley P.1127]], assuming the aircraft to have a larger engine, a pair of Red Top, and the [[AIRPASS]] radar from the Lightning.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=42}}\n\n===Testing and service===\n[[File:Red Top.jpg|right|thumb|Red Top on display at the [[Royal Air Force Museum Cosford|RAF Museum Cosford]].]]\n[[File:Hawker Siddeley Red Top missile.jpg|thumb|Hawker Siddeley Red Top missile mounted on an [[English Electric Lightning]] at the [[RAF Museum]] at [[Hendon]], [[London]]. ]]\n\nRed Top testing began using the new fuselage layout with the original Firestreak faceted nosecone and leftover Magpie III motors from the Blue Vesta program. Ten such lash-ups had been fired by June 1959. Guidance tests with the new motor and seeker were carried out from an [[English Electric Canberra]] beginning in early 1960 and firing from the Lightning in September 1961.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=42}}\n\nThe Red Top entered service on both the Lightning and Sea Vixen in [[1964 in aviation|1964]]. It remained in service until the final retirement of the Lightning in [[1988 in aviation|1988]].<ref>Gibson 2007, p. 41, 42</ref> Unusually, the missile that the Red Top was intended to replace \u2013 Firestreak \u2013 also remained in service on the Lightning until 1988. This was because Red Top's larger wing area required the Lightning to have a larger fin to maintain stability, leaving Firestreak on the other models that were already in service.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=42}}\n\n===Further upgrades===\nWhile development of Red Top was being carried out, another adaptation of the original Firestreak was being considered to produce a [[semi-active radar homing]] version that would allow a single airframe to be converted from IR to radar by changing the nose section. Initially known as Blue Jay Mk. V, this became \"Blue Dolphin\", but this was cancelled in 1958{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=41}}\n\nA longer-ranged Red Top Mk. 2 was also proposed, replacing the Linnet rocket with a [[liquid fuel rocket]] running on MADI/RFNA, likely the de Havilland Spartan.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=42}}\n\n== Former operators ==\n[[File:Red Top operators.png|thumb|Map with Red Top operators in blue]]\n; {{KUW}}\n* [[Kuwait Air Force]]\n; {{SAU}}\n* [[Royal Saudi Air Force]]\n; {{UK}}\n* [[Royal Air Force]]\n* [[Royal Navy]], [[Fleet Air Arm]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Rainbow Codes]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*{{Cite book\n  | last1 = Gibson| first1 = Chris\n  | first2 = Tony| last2 = Buttler\n  | title = British Secret Projects: Hypersonics, Ramjets and Missiles\n  | publisher = Midland Publishing\n  | year= 2007\n  | pages = 47\u201353\n  | isbn = 978-1-85780-258-0 \n  |ref=harv\n}}\n\n{{UKmissiles}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Red Top (Missile)}}\n[[Category:Cold War air-to-air missiles of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Air-to-air missiles of the United Kingdom]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox weapon\n|is_missile=yes\n| image= Red Top missile.png\n| image_size = 250\n|caption= Red Top missile\n|name=Red Top\n|type=[[Air-to-air missile]]\n|origin=United Kingdom\n|era=Cold War\n|platform=aircraft\n|target=aircraft\n|manufacturer=Hawker Siddeley Dynamics\n|design_date=\n|production_date=\n|service=1964 - 1988\n|used_by= United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait\n|wars=\n|spec_type= homing missile\n|diameter= 0.23 m\n|wingspan=0.91 m\n|length=3.32 m\n|weight= 154 kg\n|speed=Mach 3.2\n|vehicle_range=7.5 miles (12 km)\n|ceiling=\n|filling=31 kg (68.3 lb) [[annular blast fragmentation]]\n|engine=''Linnet'' solid fuel motor\n|steering=control surfaces\n|guidance=[[infrared homing]], limited [[all-aspect]]\n|variants=?\n|number=\n|detonation=''Green Garland'' infrared proximity; secondary contact [[fuze]]\n}}\n\nThe [[Hawker Siddeley]] (later [[British Aerospace]]) '''Red Top''' was the third indigenous British [[air-to-air missile]] to enter service, following the [[de Havilland Firestreak]] and limited-service [[Fireflash]].

Although not offering the true all-aspect capability planned for Blue Vesta, Violet Banner did allow head-on attacks against supersonic aircraft.<ref>[http://www.vectorsite.net/aveeltg.html The English Electric (BAC) Lightning<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  \"Unlike modern [1990s] missiles, Red Top and Firestreak could only be fired outside cloud, and in winter, skies were rarely clear over the UK.\"<ref name=Black141>Black, Ian, ''The Last of the Lightnings'', pub PSL, 1996, {{ISBN|1-85260-541-3}}, p141.</ref>\n\n===Almost cancelled===\nAlthough Red Top was a relatively straightforward upgrade to Firestreak, [[Duncan Sandys]] almost cancelled it as well. He felt that Firestreak would be acceptable during the short period before the [[Bristol Bloodhound|Bloodhound Mk. II]] [[Surface-to-air missile|SAM]] entered service in the early 1960s and eliminated the need for [[interceptor aircraft]] altogether. The [[Air Staff (United Kingdom)|Air Staff]] argued this point, ultimately convincing him that Red Top's head-on attack profile against new Soviet supersonic bombers known to be in development was an urgent requirement.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=41}}\n\nAt a February 1958 meeting of the Controller of Guided Weapons and Electronics, the group earmarked Red Top for both Lightning and the [[Fleet Air Arm]]'s [[de Havilland Sea Vixen]]. It was expected that Red Top would offer a dramatic leap in performance for Sea Vixen, as its enlarged motor significantly improved its performance when launched subsonically, the relative improvement is less when launched from Lightning. There was also some discussion of mounting four Red Top on [[Blackburn Buccaneer]], likely the B.112 version that had been proposed to replace Sea Vixen for long-duration [[combat air patrol]].{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=41}}\n\nIndependently, in 1959 Jon Fozard of [[Hawker Aircraft]] also considered using Red Top on the [[Hawker Siddeley P.1127]], assuming the aircraft to have a larger engine, a pair of Red Top, and the [[AIRPASS]] radar from the Lightning.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=42}}\n\n===Testing and service===\n[[File:Red Top.jpg|right|thumb|Red Top on display at the [[Royal Air Force Museum Cosford|RAF Museum Cosford]].]]\n[[File:Hawker Siddeley Red Top missile.jpg|thumb|Hawker Siddeley Red Top missile mounted on an [[English Electric Lightning]] at the [[RAF Museum]] at [[Hendon]], [[London]]. ]]\n\nRed Top testing began using the new fuselage layout with the original Firestreak faceted nosecone and leftover Magpie III motors from the Blue Vesta program. Ten such lash-ups had been fired by June 1959. Guidance tests with the new motor and seeker were carried out from an [[English Electric Canberra]] beginning in early 1960 and firing from the Lightning in September 1961.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=42}}\n\nThe Red Top entered service on both the Lightning and Sea Vixen in [[1964 in aviation|1964]]. It remained in service until the final retirement of the Lightning in [[1988 in aviation|1988]].<ref>Gibson 2007, p. 41, 42</ref> Unusually, the missile that the Red Top was intended to replace \u2013 Firestreak \u2013 also remained in service on the Lightning until 1988. This was because Red Top's larger wing area required the Lightning to have a larger fin to maintain stability, leaving Firestreak on the other models that were already in service.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=42}}\n\n===Further upgrades===\nWhile development of Red Top was being carried out, another adaptation of the original Firestreak was being considered to produce a [[semi-active radar homing]] version that would allow a single airframe to be converted from IR to radar by changing the nose section. Initially known as Blue Jay Mk. V, this became \"Blue Dolphin\", but this was cancelled in 1958{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=41}}\n\nA longer-ranged Red Top Mk. 2 was also proposed, replacing the Linnet rocket with a [[liquid fuel rocket]] running on MADI/RFNA, likely the de Havilland Spartan.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=42}}\n\n== Former operators ==\n[[File:Red Top operators.png|thumb|Map with Red Top operators in blue]]\n; {{KUW}}\n* [[Kuwait Air Force]]\n; {{SAU}}\n* [[Royal Saudi Air Force]]\n; {{UK}}\n* [[Royal Air Force]]\n* [[Royal Navy]], [[Fleet Air Arm]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Rainbow Codes]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*{{Cite book\n  | last1 = Gibson| first1 = Chris\n  | first2 = Tony| last2 = Buttler\n  | title = British Secret Projects: Hypersonics, Ramjets and Missiles\n  | publisher = Midland Publishing\n  | year= 2007\n  | pages = 47\u201353\n  | isbn = 978-1-85780-258-0 \n  |ref=harv\n}}\n\n{{UKmissiles}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Red Top (Missile)}}\n[[Category:Cold War air-to-air missiles of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Air-to-air missiles of the United Kingdom]]\n", "name_user": "Maury Markowitz", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eImproved Blue Jay", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Top_(missile)"}
