It was however decided to move the medical school to the eastern suburbs of Brussels, including the construction of a new university hospital complex. In 1968, UCLouvain acquired land in the Brussels municipality of [[Woluwe-Saint-Lambert]] and set up its medical faculties, which opened in 1974.<ref name=\":0\" /> In the early 1970s, the university also began construction of the new hospital, the [[Cliniques universitaires Saint-Luc]], which were inaugurated in 1976.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.saintluc.be/institution/historique.php|title=Historique de l'UCLouvain|website=Cliniques universitaires Saint-Louis}}</ref> The [[Alma metro station|Alma]] metro station on the city's rapid transit network, located in the centre of the campus, was inaugurated in 1986.\n\nInitially dedicated to education in [[medical sciences]] by the university or partner schools, the campus quickly became a multidisciplinary hub by inviting an increasing number of partner institutions, to become Brussels' second largest student campus, with over 14,000 students.\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Metro Alma jun 1982 17.jpg|thumb|200x200px|''Place de l'Alma'' in 1982.]]\nSimilar to [[Louvain-la-Neuve]], a [[planned city]] built in the 1970s, the Woluwe site is built on an [[Urban area|urban]] and neo-pedestrian model. The campus is centered around the ''Place de l'Alma'', the main square built on different levels, whose buildings are now listed as protected monuments. From the very beginning, the Alma square is planned to include the university's administrative services (the \"Mairie\"),<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://patrimoine.brussels/liens/publications-numeriques/versions-pdf/a-la-carte/woluwe-saint-lambert|title=Woluwe-Saint-Lambert \u00e0 la carte|last=Department for Cultural Heritage, Bruxelles Urbanisme et Patrimoine|website=patrimoine.brussels|access-date=10 January 2019}}</ref> commercial and leisure facilities, particularly in the vast ''M\u00e9m\u00e9'' complex, as well as a metro station, [[Alma metro station|Alma]], considered to be a [[total artwork]]. The metro station was initially planned under the university hospital. Indeed, a large space in the state of [[Structural system|structural work]] exists under the hospital, hidden from the public.\n\nThe centre of Louvain-en-Woluwe is the work of the architect [[Lucien Kroll]]. His plan was to build a university town in consultation with the students.<ref name=\":1\" /> This is how the ''Maison M\u00e9dicale'' (the \"M\u00e9m\u00e9\") was built on the ''Place de l'Alma'', a vast multi-functional building with student accommodation on the higher floors. The buildings are designed in an ambivalent way with two opposing \"wings\": for example in the ''M\u00e9m\u00e9'', Lucien Kroll envisions on one side, a so-called \"fascist wing\", with identical ''kots'' (student rooms) down over a long corridor, and on the other hand a wing with modular spaces, lots of variations in elevation, width and height within each room and [[Sinuosity|sinuous]] corridors.

The campus, built in the 1970s following the [[Leuven]] crisis, houses the Faculties of Medicine and Dentistry, Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences and of Public Health, the [[Cliniques universitaires Saint-Luc]], the university's main academic hospital, as well as many other [[List of universities in Belgium|institutions of higher education]] and a vast sports complex.\n\nIt is one of the three UCLouvain sites in Brussels, with [[UCLouvain Faculty of Architecture, Architectural Engineering and Urban Planning#Brussels Saint-Gilles|UCLouvain Bruxelles Saint-Gilles]] and [[Saint-Louis University, Brussels]].\n\n==History==\nFollowing the split of the [[Catholic University of Louvain]] into two legally independent entities in 1968, the majority of the [[French Community of Belgium|French-speaking]] university was relocated in [[Louvain-la-Neuve]] ([[Walloon Brabant]]) since 1972. It was however decided to move the medical school to the eastern suburbs of Brussels, including the construction of a new university hospital complex. In 1968, UCLouvain acquired land in the Brussels municipality of [[Woluwe-Saint-Lambert]] and set up its medical faculties, which opened in 1974.<ref name=\":0\" /> In the early 1970s, the university also began construction of the new hospital, the [[Cliniques universitaires Saint-Luc]], which were inaugurated in 1976.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.saintluc.be/institution/historique.php|title=Historique de l'UCLouvain|website=Cliniques universitaires Saint-Louis}}</ref> The [[Alma metro station|Alma]] metro station on the city's rapid transit network, located in the centre of the campus, was inaugurated in 1986.\n\nInitially dedicated to education in [[medical sciences]] by the university or partner schools, the campus quickly became a multidisciplinary hub by inviting an increasing number of partner institutions, to become Brussels' second largest student campus, with over 14,000 students.\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Metro Alma jun 1982 17.jpg|thumb|200x200px|''Place de l'Alma'' in 1982.]]\nSimilar to [[Louvain-la-Neuve]], a [[planned city]] built in the 1970s, the Woluwe site is built on an [[Urban area|urban]] and neo-pedestrian model. The campus is centered around the ''Place de l'Alma'', the main square built on different levels, whose buildings are now listed as protected monuments. From the very beginning, the Alma square is planned to include the university's administrative services (the \"Mairie\"),<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://patrimoine.brussels/liens/publications-numeriques/versions-pdf/a-la-carte/woluwe-saint-lambert|title=Woluwe-Saint-Lambert \u00e0 la carte|last=Department for Cultural Heritage, Bruxelles Urbanisme et Patrimoine|website=patrimoine.brussels|access-date=10 January 2019}}</ref> commercial and leisure facilities, particularly in the vast ''M\u00e9m\u00e9'' complex, as well as a metro station, [[Alma metro station|Alma]], considered to be a [[total artwork]]. The metro station was initially planned under the university hospital. Indeed, a large space in the state of [[Structural system|structural work]] exists under the hospital, hidden from the public.\n\nThe centre of Louvain-en-Woluwe is the work of the architect [[Lucien Kroll]]. His plan was to build a university town in consultation with the students.<ref name=\":1\" /> This is how the ''Maison M\u00e9dicale'' (the \"M\u00e9m\u00e9\") was built on the ''Place de l'Alma'', a vast multi-functional building with student accommodation on the higher floors. The buildings are designed in an ambivalent way with two opposing \"wings\": for example in the ''M\u00e9m\u00e9'', Lucien Kroll envisions on one side, a so-called \"fascist wing\", with identical ''kots'' (student rooms) down over a long corridor, and on the other hand a wing with modular spaces, lots of variations in elevation, width and height within each room and [[Sinuosity|sinuous]] corridors. Shared ''kots'' have also been designed, called ''granges'' (\"barns\").<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nTo the north of ''Place de l'Alma'' are the UCLouvain buildings: the hospital at north-west, university spaces to the east.

An innovative techniques for early detection of power swing in the network is being developed, which helps in taking preventive measures for the protection of electrical components such as generators and transformers.\n\nUnder the energy efficiency research, the power consumption pattern in residential buildings is being analyzed by a three level power monitoring system. The system monitors the energy usage at regional, house and appliance levels using advances sensor technologies and analytics.<ref>http://news.asiaone.com/News/Latest+News/Science+and+Tech/Story/A1Story20111127-312909.html</ref><ref>http://202.93.211.141/current-projects.html</ref>  By these technologies, the homes can be made grid 'friendly' by balancing the load and improving the efficiency of energy consumption. Possibilities of using renewable energy from photo-voltaic sources are also investigated in this project. The study can further be extended to energy benchmarking in residential buildings in Brunei. Benchmarking provides the baseline measure for EEC, and it provides supporting data for building energy management.\n\nThe Centre is also involved in community level energy projects at  Sukang,  Belait district. Apart from providing clean energy to this remote community, the project also aims to demonstrate how the use of clean technologies can lower the carbon foot print by adopting renewable resources as well as improving the efficiency in energy usage. Specially designed algorithms are being used to control the power generation, schedule and distribute the load, and to optimise power consumption.<ref>http://conferences.sigcomm.org/eenergy/2013/papers/p11.pdf</ref> The system will have a highly interactive and user friendly control interface which can be easily managed with minimal technical training.\n\nAnother area of focus of the centre is food security. Under this component, computer models to support the Agricultural Systems are developed.<ref>http://www.research.ibm.com/articles/brunei.shtml</ref> A decision support system for the efficient management of paddy cultivation is being developed under this research.

Blue Gene/P has a massively parallel architecture consisting of 1024 independent units of microprocessors that are connected together to form a very high computational capacity.  The computational power of Blue Gene/P is being utilized for high resolution weather forecasting which can predict the weather 48 hours ahead at a high resolution of 1.5&nbsp;km x 1.5&nbsp;km. These weather forecasts are further used for various applications like analyzing the effects of climate change, flood forecasting, solar and wind power forecasts and agro-technologies like mobile applications for rice farmers.\n\n==Research Projects==\n\nCurrently, The Centre focuses its research on Regional Climate and Weather Modelling, Energy Efficiency, Renewable Energy, Agro-technology and Hydrology using high performance computing facilities which are installed at UBD, thus moving forward with its mission \"Innovating for Sustainable Earth\".<ref>http://www.research.ibm.com/articles/brunei.shtml</ref><ref>http://www.infotech.monash.edu.au/seminars/2013/introduction-ibm-research.html</ref><ref>http://www.brusearch.com/news/117840</ref>\n\nEnergy is one of the major research focuses of the UBD|IBM Centre. A number of research projects in this area are being undertaken by the Centre during past 2 years.<ref>http://www.thesmetimes.com/index.php/extras/latest-news/627-universiti-brunei-darussalam-and-ibm-drive-smarter-energy-research-initiatives.html</ref><ref>http://www.bt.com.bn/news-national/2011/10/16/ubd-ibm-centre-can-turn-brunei-energy-management-expert</ref><ref>http://www.theborneopost.com/2013/06/26/ubd-ibm-drive-smarter-energy-research-initiatives/</ref> An example is the project on developing a system to model and forecast the performance of solar photovoltaic modules under varying weather conditions.<ref>{{Cite book |doi = 10.1109/ISGT-Asia.2013.6698758|isbn = 978-1-4799-1347-3|chapter = Comparative performance of grid integrated solar photovoltaic systems under the tropical environment|title = 2013 IEEE Innovative Smart Grid Technologies-Asia (ISGT Asia)|year = 2013|last1 = Ismail|first1 = Hamidah|last2 = Mathew|first2 = Sathyajith|last3 = Aloka|first3 = S.|last4 = Narayanaswamy|first4 = Balakrishnan|last5 = Ming|first5 = Lim Chee|last6 = Hussain|first6 = Saiful Azmi|pages = 1\u20136}}</ref> Such studies, apart from giving insights to the design requirements of grid integrated and roof top solar PV systems, would also help in strategising optimal integration and dispatch of solar electricity to the electricity grids.\n\nAnother project under energy aims at improving the stability and reliability of the power distribution systems.<ref>http://www.ubd.edu.bn/news-and-events/highlights-archive/power-system-modelling-research/</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://archive.bt.com.bn/business-national/2013/06/26/ibm-ubd-ink-deal-energy-saving-research |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525201003/http://archive.bt.com.bn/business-national/2013/06/26/ibm-ubd-ink-deal-energy-saving-research |archivedate=2014-05-25 }}</ref> This addresses the \u2018power swing\u2019 phenomena, which is basically the fluctuations and oscillations in the electrical parameters resulting in disturbances in the power systems. An innovative techniques for early detection of power swing in the network is being developed, which helps in taking preventive measures for the protection of electrical components such as generators and transformers.\n\nUnder the energy efficiency research, the power consumption pattern in residential buildings is being analyzed by a three level power monitoring system. The system monitors the energy usage at regional, house and appliance levels using advances sensor technologies and analytics.<ref>http://news.asiaone.com/News/Latest+News/Science+and+Tech/Story/A1Story20111127-312909.html</ref><ref>http://202.93.211.141/current-projects.html</ref>  By these technologies, the homes can be made grid 'friendly' by balancing the load and improving the efficiency of energy consumption. Possibilities of using renewable energy from photo-voltaic sources are also investigated in this project. The study can further be extended to energy benchmarking in residential buildings in Brunei. Benchmarking provides the baseline measure for EEC, and it provides supporting data for building energy management.\n\nThe Centre is also involved in community level energy projects at  Sukang,  Belait district. Apart from providing clean energy to this remote community, the project also aims to demonstrate how the use of clean technologies can lower the carbon foot print by adopting renewable resources as well as improving the efficiency in energy usage. Specially designed algorithms are being used to control the power generation, schedule and distribute the load, and to optimise power consumption.<ref>http://conferences.sigcomm.org/eenergy/2013/papers/p11.pdf</ref> The system will have a highly interactive and user friendly control interface which can be easily managed with minimal technical training.\n\nAnother area of focus of the centre is food security. Under this component, computer models to support the Agricultural Systems are developed.<ref>http://www.research.ibm.com/articles/brunei.shtml</ref> A decision support system for the efficient management of paddy cultivation is being developed under this research.

For further releases, footage from all three performances was edited together.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Idea===\nTo mark the extraordinary milestone of 25 years, Andrew Lloyd Webber and Cameron Mackintosh planned a special 3-day production to take place at London's Royal Albert Hall in October 2011. Designer Matt Kinley initially planned to hold a concert-style production not unlike the [[Les Mis\u00e9rables in Concert: The 25th Anniversary|''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' 25th anniversary concert at the O2 Arena]], but Mackintosh made it clear the show would be fully staged, as both he and Lloyd Webber felt it would not work unless it was the whole show. As a result, the event was planned as a full show.\n\n===Royal Albert Hall===\nDesigning the staged show at the Royal Albert Hall was a daunting task, as the space (or lack of) was not an easy one to translate a [[proscenium]] show into. As a concert hall rather than a theatre, many of the show's elements (such as the chandelier, which instead of falling, exploded) had to be toned down and simplified: the Royal Albert Hall was simply not capable of accepting a show the size of ''The Phantom of the Opera'', or at least not the full original. The balconies of the hall were used to build uprights to form an opera house proscenium with boxes on each side. The orchestra was elevated on a platform and backed by a gauze which projected the opera sets via LEDs.\n\n===Live streaming===\nTickets for the three performances sold out within five hours of going on sale. In order to enable more people to see the production, the final performance was relayed live to cinemas around the world via [[Fathom Events]].\n\n==Plot==\n{{plot|date=December 2014}}\n\n===Prologue===\nIn 1905, the Vicomte de Chagny attends an auction of old theatrical props at the Paris Op\u00e9ra and purchases a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 music box, noting that it appears \"exactly as she said.\" The auctioneer presents a chandelier as the next item up for bid, noting its connection to \"the strange affair of the Phantom of the Opera\". As the mammoth fixture comes to life, the years roll back and the Op\u00e9ra's former grandeur is restored (\"Overture\").\n\n===Act I===\nIt is now 1881. As Carlotta, the Op\u00e9ra's resident soprano [[prima donna]], rehearses for that evening's performance, a [[Backdrop (theater)|backdrop]] collapses without warning. The anxious cast members whisper about \"The Phantom of the Opera\", who Carlotta reveals has been troubling the Opera Populaire \"for the past three years\". The Opera's new owners, Firmin and Andr\u00e9, try to downplay the incident, but Carlotta angrily chastises the pair for saying \"these things do happen\" and storms offstage, closely followed by Monsieur Piangi. Meg Giry, the daughter of the Op\u00e9ra's ballet mistress Madame Giry, tells Firmin and Andr\u00e9 that Christine Daa\u00e9, a [[chorus girl]] and orphaned daughter of a prominent violinist, has been \"well taught\", and could sing Carlotta's role. With cancellation of the performance their only alternative, the owners reluctantly audition Christine, and to their surprise she is exceptional in the role (\"Think Of Me\").\n\nBackstage after her triumphant d\u00e9but, Christine confesses to Meg that she knows her mysterious teacher only as an invisible \"Angel of Music\" (\"Angel of Music\"). The new patron, Raoul, Vicomte de Chagny, finds Christine, his old childhood playmate, in her dressing room. Christine reminds Raoul about the \"Angel of Music\" stories that her late father used to tell them, and confides that the Angel has been visiting her and given her her astonishing voice. Raoul good-naturedly accepts her revelation, and invites her to dinner. Christine, to his puzzlement, is not as willing, claiming that her Angel is a stern taskmaster and that he will not be pleased by her absence. Raoul jokingly states that he will not keep her up late and exits, telling her that he'll be back for her in two minutes (\"Little Lotte\"). Christine fearfully calls after him that \"things have changed\" as the jealous Angel of Music condemns Raoul for \"sharing in my triumph\". Christine begs him to reveal himself. The Angel obliges and materialises in her mirror. The mirror opens, revealing the Angel to be the Phantom of the Opera, who leads Christine away. Raoul finds Christine's dressing room empty and calls out for her (\"The Mirror (Angel of Music)\"). The Phantom and Christine cross a subterranean lake to his secret lair beneath the Op\u00e9ra house (\"The Phantom of the Opera\"). The Phantom explains that he has chosen Christine to sing his music and serenades her (\"The Music of the Night\"). Overwhelmed, Christine faints and the Phantom carries her to a bed and expresses his adoration for her.\n\nAs the Phantom composes music at his organ (\"I Remember\"), Christine awakens to the sound of the monkey music box. She slips up behind the Phantom, lifts his mask, and beholds his face. The Phantom rails at her, damning her for her curiosity as Christine hides herself in fear. The Phantom ruefully expresses his longing to look normal\u2014and to be loved by her (\"Stranger Than You Dreamt It\"). Christine returns the Phantom's mask to him and the Phantom leads her back to the Op\u00e9ra house.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the Op\u00e9ra House, Joseph Buquet, the Op\u00e9ra's chief stagehand, regales the chorus girls with tales of the \"Op\u00e9ra Ghost\" and his [[Hangman's knot|magical lasso]]. Madame Giry warns Buquet to exercise restraint (\"Magical Lasso\"). In the managers\u2019 office, Andr\u00e9 and Firman read notes from the Phantom aloud and are interrupted by Raoul, who accuses them of sending him a note saying that he should make no attempt to see Christine again. Carlotta and Piangi then burst into the office, demanding to know who sent Carlotta a note saying that her days at the Op\u00e9ra are numbered. As Andr\u00e9 and Firmin try to calm the distressed Carlotta, Madame Giry delivers another note from the Phantom: he demands that Christine replace Carlotta in the new opera, ''Il Muto'', or there will be a terrible disaster \"beyond imagination\" (\"Notes\u2026\"). Firmin and Andr\u00e9 assure the enraged Carlotta that she will remain the star, begging her to \"entrance us once again\" (\"Prima Donna\"). The performance begins well, with Andr\u00e9 and Firmin joking about the disaster the Phantom threatened. The Phantom's voice suddenly cuts through the performance, angrily reminding them that he had instructed them to keep Box 5 empty for his use. As Christine whispers that she knows the Phantom is near, Carlotte reminds her that her role is silent, calling her a \"little toad\". The Phantom states that it is Carlotta who is the toad and reduces Carlotta's voice to a frog-like croak. Firmin quickly tries to calm the situation by telling the audience that Christine will take over the starring role, moving forward the ballet to keep the audience entertained. Suddenly, the corpse of Buquet, hanging from the Phantom's magical lasso, drops from the rafters. Firmin and Andr\u00e9 plead for calm as the Phantom's diabolical laughter is heard (\"Poor Fool, He Makes Me Laugh\").\n\nIn the ensuing chaos, Christine escapes with Raoul to the roof, where she tells him about her subterranean rendezvous with the Phantom. Raoul is skeptical, telling her that what she experienced was just a dream (\"Why Have You Brought Me Here?/Raoul, I've Been There\"). Seeing Christine's fear is real, he swears to love and to protect her always. They acknowledge their love for each other as Christine and Raoul return to the Opera House (\"All I Ask of You\"). The Phantom, who has overheard their conversation, is heartbroken and accuses Christine of denying and betraying him. He tearfully rues that Raoul was \"bound to love you when he heard you sing\". As Raoul and Christine's expression of love for each other reverberates through the rooftops he angrily vows revenge, destroying the Op\u00e9ra's mighty chandelier with a massive explosion as the curtain falls (\"I Gave You My Music\").\n\n===Act II===\nSix months later, in the midst of a splendid masquerade ball, the Phantom, costumed as the Red Death, makes his first appearance since the chandelier disaster (\"Masquerade/Why So Silent?\"). He announces to the stunned guests that he has written an opera entitled ''[[Don Juan Triumphant]]''. He demands that it be produced immediately, with Christine (who is now secretly engaged to Raoul) as the lead female role, and threatens dire consequences if his instructions are not implicitly obeyed before vanishing in a ghostly flash of fire and smoke. Raoul demands that Madame Giry tell him about the Phantom. She reluctantly replies that he is a brilliant musician and magician born with a terrifyingly deformed face, who escaped from captivity in a travelling freak show and disappeared.\n\nDuring rehearsals, Raoul - tired of the tyranny with which the Phantom rules the Opera - thinks to use the premi\u00e8re of ''Don Juan Triumphant'' as a trap to capture the Phantom and put an end to his reign of terror once and for all. Carlotta falsely accuses Christine of being the mastermind and that it is her plan so she can be the star. Christine angrily defends herself, saying that it is not true. Carlotta storms out in rage. Raoul, knowing of the Phantom's obsession with his fianc\u00e9e, asserts that the Phantom will be sure to attend (\"Notes/Twisted Every Way\"). Christine, torn between her love for Raoul and her fear of the Phantom, visits her father's grave, longing for his guidance but understanding that she must move on (\"Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again\"). The Phantom appears, once again under the guise of the Angel of Music (\"Wandering Child\"). Christine, tired and heartbroken, once again accepts her \"Angel\" as a friend, nearly succumbing to the Phantom's influence, but Raoul arrives to both rescue her and confront The Phantom. The Phantom taunts Raoul, magically summoning pillars of fire at them (\"Bravo, Monsieur\") and causing them to flee. Furious, the Phantom sets fire to the cemetery, waging war upon them both.\n\n''Don Juan Triumphant'' opens with Christine and Piangi singing the lead roles. During Don Juan's and Aminta's duet, Christine comes to the sudden realization that she is singing not with Piangi, but with the Phantom himself (\"The Point of No Return\"). Mimicking Raoul's vow of devotion on the rooftop, the Phantom once again expresses love for Christine and slips his ring onto her finger; Christine rips off his mask, exposing his horrifically deformed face to the shocked audience. Chaos ensues. Piangi's garroted body is revealed backstage, the cast and audience fly into a state of panic, and the Phantom seizes Christine and flees the theatre. An angry mob, vowing vengeance for murdering Buquet and Piangi, searches the theatre for the Phantom, while Madame Giry tells Raoul how to find the Phantom's subterranean lair, and warns him to beware his magical lasso. (\"Down Once More/Track Down This Murderer\").\n\nIn the lair, Christine is forced to don a wedding dress. Raoul finds the lair and attempts to persuade the Phantom to spare Christine, begging him to show compassion. The Phantom refuses, stating that \"the world showed no compassion to me\" and claiming that his intention was never to hurt Christine for Raoul's \"sins.\" The Phantom captures Raoul with his lasso and turns to Christine - he bargains that he will free Raoul if she agrees to stay with him forever; if she refuses, Raoul will die. Christine, heartbroken, tells the Phantom that it is his soul that is deformed, not his face. As the Phantom and Raoul both plead to her, Christine mournfully wonders what kind of life the Phantom has known. She tells the Phantom that he is not alone and kisses him, showing him compassion. The Phantom, having experienced kindness, at last, understands that he cannot compel Christine to love him. He sets them both free, telling them to forget about \"this angel in hell\". Christine returns the Phantom's ring to him, and he tells her he loves her. Christine exits with Raoul. Lamenting that, without Christine, \"it's over now, the music of the night\", the Phantom makes his way to his throne and covers himself with his cloak. Meg enters the Phantom's lair and pulls away the cloak, finding only the Phantom's mask. She holds the Phantom's mask up and looks out to the audience as the lights fade to black.\n\n===Grand Finale===\nAfter the cast bow-out, [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] delivers a speech to the audience before bringing out the Royal Albert Hall creative team, the original creative team, as well as the original leads from both the London and Broadway productions, and the original London cast, including [[Michael Crawford]] and [[Sarah Brightman]]. Sarah Brightman then sings \"The Phantom of the Opera\" with four Phantoms: [[Colm Wilkinson]] from the original workshop and the Canadian production, [[Anthony Warlow]] from the Australian production, [[Peter J\u00f6back]], who has now played the role in the West End, Broadway, and Sweden, [[John Owen-Jones]] from the London and 25th Anniversary Tour productions. The performance concludes when Ramin Karimloo joins the four Phantoms to sing \"The Music of the Night\", along with the entire cast and creative teams including Michael Crawford.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ramin Karimloo]] as [[Erik (The Phantom of the Opera)|The Phantom]]\n* [[Sierra Boggess]] as [[Christine Daa\u00e9]]\n* [[Hadley Fraser]] as [[Viscount Raoul de Chagny|Raoul, Vicomte de Chagny]]\n* Wendy Ferguson as [[Carlotta Giudicelli]]\n* [[Liz Robertson]] as [[Madame Giry]]\n* Daisy Maywood as [[Meg Giry]]\n* [[Barry James]] as Monsieur Richard Firmin\n* Gareth Snook as Monsieur Gilles Andr\u00e9\n* [[Wynne Evans]] as Ubaldo Piangi\n* Nick Holder as Joseph Buquet\n* [[Earl Carpenter]] as Auctioneer\n\n==Home media==\nThe production was recorded live and later released on Blu-ray, DVD, CD and digital download. The initial releases were in the UK on November 14, 2011. The digital download format was released three days earlier on November 11. The North American release followed on February 7, 2012.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|2077886|The Phantom of the Opera at the Royal Albert Hall}}\n* {{Facebook|POTO25|''The Phantom of the Opera at the Royal Albert Hall''}}\n* {{instagram|PhantomRoyalAlbertHall|''The Phantom of the Opera at the Royal Albert Hall''}}\n* {{allmovie|548952|The Phantom of the Opera at the Royal Albert Hall}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|phantom_of_the_opera_from_the_royal_albert_hall}}\n\n{{Andrew Lloyd Webber}}\n{{The Phantom of the Opera}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Phantom Of The Opera At The Royal Albert Hall, The}}\n[[Category:2011 films]]\n[[Category:2010s musical films]]\n[[Category:2010s romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:2010s thriller films]]\n[[Category:British films]]\n[[Category:British romantic drama films]]\n[[Category:British thriller films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about opera]]\n[[Category:Films based on musicals]]\n[[Category:Films based on The Phantom of the Opera]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1905]]\n[[Category:Films set in London]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1881]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1882]]\n[[Category:Films shot in London]]\n[[Category:British musical drama films]]\n[[Category:British romantic musical films]]\n[[Category:Royal Albert Hall]]\n[[Category:Universal Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Films based on adaptations]]\n[[Category:Musicals by Andrew Lloyd Webber]]\n[[Category:2010s musical drama films]]\n[[Category:The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2012}}\n{{Use British English|date=December 2012}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name = The Phantom of the Opera at the Royal Albert Hall\n| image = The Phantom of the Opera at the Royal Albert Hall Poster.jpg\n| director = [[Nick Morris]]<br />Laurence Connor <small>(stage direction)</small>\n| producer = [[Cameron Mackintosh]]<br />Dione Orrom<br />[[Brett Sullivan]]\n| based on = {{based on|''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]''|[[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]<br />[[Charles Hart (lyricist)|Charles Hart]]<br />[[Richard Stilgoe]]}}\n| story = [[Gaston Leroux]]\n| starring = [[Ramin Karimloo]]<br />[[Sierra Boggess]]<br />[[Hadley Fraser]]\n| music = [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]\n| editing = [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2171922/ Lawrence Huck]<br />[[Nick Morris]]\n| studio = [[Really Useful Group|Really Useful Films]]\n| distributor = [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]]\n| released = {{Film date|df=y|2011|10|02}}\n| runtime = 160 minutes<!--Theatrical runtime: 159:55--><ref>{{cite web|title=''PHANTOM OF THE OPERA AT THE ROYAL ALBERT HALL - THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION PERFORMANCE'' (12A)|url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/phantom-opera-royal-albert-hall-%C2%96-25th-anniversary-celebration-performance-2011|work=[[British Board of Film Classification]]|date=2011-10-25|accessdate=2012-12-23}}</ref>\n| country = United Kingdom\n| language = English\n}}\n\n'''''The Phantom of the Opera at the Royal Albert Hall''''' is a 2011 British [[film adaptation]] of [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]'s 1986 musical ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'', which in turn was based on the 1910 French novel ''[[The Phantom of the Opera|Le Fant\u00f4me de l'Op\u00e9ra]]'' by [[Gaston Leroux]].\n\nTo celebrate the 25th anniversary of the musical, three special performances on Saturday 1st October at 7.30pm and Sunday 2nd October at 1.30pm and 7.00pm were filmed at the [[Royal Albert Hall]],<ref>http://www.thephantomoftheopera.com/the-phantom-of-the-opera-at-the-royal-albert-hall/</ref> the third of which was screened live worldwide on 2 October 2011.

Carlotta and Piangi then burst into the office, demanding to know who sent Carlotta a note saying that her days at the Op\u00e9ra are numbered. As Andr\u00e9 and Firmin try to calm the distressed Carlotta, Madame Giry delivers another note from the Phantom: he demands that Christine replace Carlotta in the new opera, ''Il Muto'', or there will be a terrible disaster \"beyond imagination\" (\"Notes\u2026\"). Firmin and Andr\u00e9 assure the enraged Carlotta that she will remain the star, begging her to \"entrance us once again\" (\"Prima Donna\"). The performance begins well, with Andr\u00e9 and Firmin joking about the disaster the Phantom threatened. The Phantom's voice suddenly cuts through the performance, angrily reminding them that he had instructed them to keep Box 5 empty for his use. As Christine whispers that she knows the Phantom is near, Carlotte reminds her that her role is silent, calling her a \"little toad\". The Phantom states that it is Carlotta who is the toad and reduces Carlotta's voice to a frog-like croak. Firmin quickly tries to calm the situation by telling the audience that Christine will take over the starring role, moving forward the ballet to keep the audience entertained. Suddenly, the corpse of Buquet, hanging from the Phantom's magical lasso, drops from the rafters. Firmin and Andr\u00e9 plead for calm as the Phantom's diabolical laughter is heard (\"Poor Fool, He Makes Me Laugh\").\n\nIn the ensuing chaos, Christine escapes with Raoul to the roof, where she tells him about her subterranean rendezvous with the Phantom. Raoul is skeptical, telling her that what she experienced was just a dream (\"Why Have You Brought Me Here?/Raoul, I've Been There\"). Seeing Christine's fear is real, he swears to love and to protect her always. They acknowledge their love for each other as Christine and Raoul return to the Opera House (\"All I Ask of You\"). The Phantom, who has overheard their conversation, is heartbroken and accuses Christine of denying and betraying him. He tearfully rues that Raoul was \"bound to love you when he heard you sing\". As Raoul and Christine's expression of love for each other reverberates through the rooftops he angrily vows revenge, destroying the Op\u00e9ra's mighty chandelier with a massive explosion as the curtain falls (\"I Gave You My Music\").\n\n===Act II===\nSix months later, in the midst of a splendid masquerade ball, the Phantom, costumed as the Red Death, makes his first appearance since the chandelier disaster (\"Masquerade/Why So Silent?\"). He announces to the stunned guests that he has written an opera entitled ''[[Don Juan Triumphant]]''. He demands that it be produced immediately, with Christine (who is now secretly engaged to Raoul) as the lead female role, and threatens dire consequences if his instructions are not implicitly obeyed before vanishing in a ghostly flash of fire and smoke. Raoul demands that Madame Giry tell him about the Phantom. She reluctantly replies that he is a brilliant musician and magician born with a terrifyingly deformed face, who escaped from captivity in a travelling freak show and disappeared.\n\nDuring rehearsals, Raoul - tired of the tyranny with which the Phantom rules the Opera - thinks to use the premi\u00e8re of ''Don Juan Triumphant'' as a trap to capture the Phantom and put an end to his reign of terror once and for all. Carlotta falsely accuses Christine of being the mastermind and that it is her plan so she can be the star. Christine angrily defends herself, saying that it is not true. Carlotta storms out in rage. Raoul, knowing of the Phantom's obsession with his fianc\u00e9e, asserts that the Phantom will be sure to attend (\"Notes/Twisted Every Way\"). Christine, torn between her love for Raoul and her fear of the Phantom, visits her father's grave, longing for his guidance but understanding that she must move on (\"Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again\"). The Phantom appears, once again under the guise of the Angel of Music (\"Wandering Child\"). Christine, tired and heartbroken, once again accepts her \"Angel\" as a friend, nearly succumbing to the Phantom's influence, but Raoul arrives to both rescue her and confront The Phantom. The Phantom taunts Raoul, magically summoning pillars of fire at them (\"Bravo, Monsieur\") and causing them to flee. Furious, the Phantom sets fire to the cemetery, waging war upon them both.\n\n''Don Juan Triumphant'' opens with Christine and Piangi singing the lead roles. During Don Juan's and Aminta's duet, Christine comes to the sudden realization that she is singing not with Piangi, but with the Phantom himself (\"The Point of No Return\"). Mimicking Raoul's vow of devotion on the rooftop, the Phantom once again expresses love for Christine and slips his ring onto her finger; Christine rips off his mask, exposing his horrifically deformed face to the shocked audience. Chaos ensues. Piangi's garroted body is revealed backstage, the cast and audience fly into a state of panic, and the Phantom seizes Christine and flees the theatre. An angry mob, vowing vengeance for murdering Buquet and Piangi, searches the theatre for the Phantom, while Madame Giry tells Raoul how to find the Phantom's subterranean lair, and warns him to beware his magical lasso. (\"Down Once More/Track Down This Murderer\").\n\nIn the lair, Christine is forced to don a wedding dress. Raoul finds the lair and attempts to persuade the Phantom to spare Christine, begging him to show compassion. The Phantom refuses, stating that \"the world showed no compassion to me\" and claiming that his intention was never to hurt Christine for Raoul's \"sins.\" The Phantom captures Raoul with his lasso and turns to Christine - he bargains that he will free Raoul if she agrees to stay with him forever; if she refuses, Raoul will die. Christine, heartbroken, tells the Phantom that it is his soul that is deformed, not his face. As the Phantom and Raoul both plead to her, Christine mournfully wonders what kind of life the Phantom has known. She tells the Phantom that he is not alone and kisses him, showing him compassion. The Phantom, having experienced kindness, at last, understands that he cannot compel Christine to love him. He sets them both free, telling them to forget about \"this angel in hell\". Christine returns the Phantom's ring to him, and he tells her he loves her. Christine exits with Raoul. Lamenting that, without Christine, \"it's over now, the music of the night\", the Phantom makes his way to his throne and covers himself with his cloak. Meg enters the Phantom's lair and pulls away the cloak, finding only the Phantom's mask. She holds the Phantom's mask up and looks out to the audience as the lights fade to black.\n\n===Grand Finale===\nAfter the cast bow-out, [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] delivers a speech to the audience before bringing out the Royal Albert Hall creative team, the original creative team, as well as the original leads from both the London and Broadway productions, and the original London cast, including [[Michael Crawford]] and [[Sarah Brightman]].
