It was co-written by Bowie, bassist [[George Murray (musician)|George Murray]] and drummer [[Dennis Davis]] in September 1976. Originally a track on Bowie's 1977 album ''[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]]'', a reworked version of the song was a regular on the [[Isolar II \u2013 The 1978 World Tour|Isolar II Tour]].  A live version from that tour was used as the lead track on a 7\" EP to promote his second live album, ''[[Stage (David Bowie album)|Stage]]'' in 1978. The EP reached number 54 on the UK Singles Chart in December 1978.\n\nIn the US, the track \"Star\" was chosen as the lead track for the live EP (with \"What in the World\" and \"Breaking Glass\" as B-sides), but failed to chart, while in Japan, \"Soul Love\" was released to promote ''[[Stage (David Bowie album)|Stage]]'' (with \"Blackout\" as the B-side).\n\nBowie performed \"Breaking Glass\" on his [[Isolar II \u2013 The 1978 World Tour|Isolar II]], [[Serious Moonlight Tour|Serious Moonlight]], [[Outside Tour|Outside]], [[Heathen Tour|Heathen]], and [[A Reality Tour|A Reality]] tours.\n\n==Lyrics==\nThe original song was uncompromising even by ''[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]]'''s standards. The fractured lyric is, like several songs written during Bowie's stay in [[Berlin]], introspective of his dark, drug-filled period living in America in 1975-1976. Its lyrics, when written out, look potentially more like a paragraph than a song, and when separated into phrases, the song has a disjointed feeling. The song is also curiously short, not spanning two minutes and only going through one verse.\n\nThe lines ''\"Don't look at the carpet; I drew something awful on it\"'' refer to Bowie's practice of drawing the [[Tree of Life (Kabbalah)|Tree of Life]] on the floor during that period, as he was interested in [[Aleister Crowley]] and [[Qabbala]] at the time.\n\n==Track listing==\n# \"Breaking Glass\" (David Bowie, [[Dennis Davis]], [[George Murray (musician)|George Murray]])  \u2013 3:28\n# \"[[Art Decade]]\" (Bowie) \u2013 3:10\n# \"[[Ziggy Stardust (song)|Ziggy Stardust]]\" (Bowie) \u2013 3:32\n\n==Production credits==\n\n* '''Producers''':\n** [[Tony Visconti]]\n* '''Musicians''':\n** [[David Bowie]]: Vocals\n** [[Carlos Alomar]]: Lead Guitar\n**[[Ricky Gardiner]]: Rhythm Guitar\n** [[George Murray (musician)|George Murray]]: Bass\n** [[Dennis Davis]]: Drums\n** [[Brian Eno]]: [[MiniMoog|Minimoog  synthesizer]]\n\n==Live versions==\n\n* A spring 1978 live version recorded on the [[Isolar II \u2013 The 1978 World Tour|Isolar II Tour]] was released on ''[[Stage (David Bowie album)|Stage]]'' and on the above-mentioned single.

Written and composed by herself, \"Se Quiere, Se Mata\" was a Top Ten Hit in [[Mexico]] and on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Latin Tracks]] in the [[United States]]. The song laments the story of a young couple, Braulio and Dana, and their choice to have an [[abortion]]. Introduced as an innocent young couple well liked by their families, the two succumb to their sexual desires, and Dana becomes pregnant.

It was originally released as the B-side to \"[[Starman (song)|Starman]]\" in April 1972 and subsequently appeared on his 1972 album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''. It was later issued as a single in 1976 to promote the ''[[Changesonebowie]]'' compilation in the UK, with the US single edit of \"[[Stay (David Bowie song)|Stay]]\" as the B-side. Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]], Bowie recorded it with his backing band [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]] \u2013 at [[Trident Studios]] in London towards the end of the album's sessions. It was originally offered to the English band [[Mott the Hoople]], who declined and recorded Bowie's \"[[All the Young Dudes]]\" instead. It is a [[glam rock]] song that is influenced by [[Little Richard]] and [[the Velvet Underground]]. Lyrically, the song contains a reference to ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' and the famous lyric \"wham bam, thank you, ma'am!\"\n\n\"Suffragette City\" has received critical acclaim, with many praising the guitar work, the band's performance, false ending, famous lyric and the song's power. It has subsequently been called one of Bowie's greatest songs by multiple publications. It was performed frequently by Bowie throughout his concert tours. The song has since appeared on multiple [[compilation album]]s and has been remastered multiple times, including in 2012 for its 40th anniversary; this remaster was later included on the box set ''[[Five Years (1969\u20131973)]]'' in 2015.\n\n==Composition and recording==\n\"Suffragette City\" was recorded on 4 February 1972 at [[Trident Studios]] in London,{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=242}} towards the end of the ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|Ziggy Stardust]]'' sessions.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=477}} Also recorded during this session was \"[[Rock 'n' Roll Suicide]]\" and \"[[Starman (song)|Starman]]\".{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=242}} Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]], Bowie recorded it with his backing band [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]].<ref name=\"Blum PopMatters\">{{cite magazine|last=Blum|first=Jordan|date=12 July 2012|title=David Bowie \u2013 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/160406-david-bowie-the-rise-and-fall-of-ziggy-stardust-and-the-spiders-from|magazine=[[PopMatters]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101090527/http://www.popmatters.com/review/160406-david-bowie-the-rise-and-fall-of-ziggy-stardust-and-the-spiders-from|archivedate=1 January 2017|accessdate=8 January 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Before recording it himself, Bowie offered it to the band [[Mott the Hoople]], who he greatly admired,{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=242}} if they would forgo their plan to break up.

It was originally released as the B-side to \"[[Starman (song)|Starman]]\" in April 1972 and subsequently appeared on his 1972 album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''. It was later issued as a single in 1976 to promote the ''[[Changesonebowie]]'' compilation in the UK, with the US single edit of \"[[Stay (David Bowie song)|Stay]]\" as the B-side. Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]], Bowie recorded it with his backing band [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]] \u2013 at [[Trident Studios]] in London towards the end of the album's sessions. It was originally offered to the English band [[Mott the Hoople]], who declined and recorded Bowie's \"[[All the Young Dudes]]\" instead. It is a [[glam rock]] song that is influenced by [[Little Richard]] and [[the Velvet Underground]].

The word has been absorbed into English from the [[French language|French]] term ''{{lang|fr|route \u00e0 [[wikt:corniche#French|corniche]]}}'' or \"road on a ledge\", originally derived from the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''{{lang|it|[[wikt:corniche#French|cornice]]}}, for \"ledge\".\n\n==Europe==\n===France===\nThree famed corniche roads of the [[C\u00f4te d'Azur]] in the [[French Riviera]] run between the sea and mountains from [[Nice]] eastward toward [[Menton]].

The ''{{lang|fr|Grande Corniche}}'' featured prominently in the [[Alfred Hitchcock]] film ''[[To Catch a Thief]]''.\n\n===Italy===\nThe [[Amalfi Drive]], along the [[Amalfi Coast]] south of Naples, is a road carved into the cliffs along the Mediterranean Sea, and can be classified as a corniche.

It was released in November 1975 as the lead single of his tenth studio album ''[[Station to Station]]'' (1976). It was the first track completed during the album's sessions, a period when Bowie's [[cocaine]] addiction was at its peak. At one stage it was slated to be the album's title track.\n\n==Composition and lyrics==\n\"Golden Years\" was the first track recorded for ''Station to Station'' in September 1975 at [[Cherokee Studios]] in Los Angeles.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|pp=236\u2013237}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=288}} Regarding the recording, co-producer [[Harry Maslin]] recalled that the song was \"cut and finished very fast. We knew it was absolutely right within ten days. But the rest of the album took forever.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=175}} At one stage it was slated to be the album's title track.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=175}} Sources differ as to who the track was written for. According to authors [[Nicholas Pegg]], David Buckley and Christopher Sandford, the track was supposedly written for [[Elvis Presley]] to cover, who turned it down.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|pp=236\u2013237}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=176}}{{sfn|Sandford|1998|p=146}} Bowie recalled that Presley had heard the demos and because both artists were signed to [[RCA Records]] at the time, Presley's manager [[Colonel Tom Parker]] thought that Bowie should write songs for Presley. Bowie stated that he had \"adored\" Presley and would have loved to work with him.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|pp=236\u2013237}} Although the artists' office contacted each other, nothing ever came to fruition. Presley sent a note to Bowie saying, \"All the best, and have a great tour\"; Bowie kept the note for the rest of his life.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|pp=236\u2013237}} Bowie's first wife [[Angie Bowie]] later claimed that the song was written for her,{{sfn|Sandford|1998|p=146}}{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=237}} saying that he sang the track over the telephone to her, \"just the way, all those years before, he'd sung me [the ''[[Aladdin Sane]]'' track] \"[[The Prettiest Star]]\". It had a similar effect. I bought it.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=176}} According to Sandford, Ava Cherry also claimed to have been the inspiration for the song.{{sfn|Sandford|1998|p=146}}\n\nMusically, \"Golden Years\" is a [[funk]] and [[disco]] song.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=288}}<ref name=\"Mojica CoS\">{{cite web | url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2010/10/album-review-david-bowie-station-to-statio/ | title=David Bowie \u2013 ''Station to Station'' [Special Edition] | website=[[Consequence of Sound]] | date=4 October 2010 | accessdate=1 June 2016 | last=Mojica |first= Frank | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160709192925/http://consequenceofsound.net/2010/10/album-review-david-bowie-station-to-statio/ | archive-date=9 July 2016 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"Erlewine AllMusic\">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/station-to-station-mw0000098920|title=''Station to Station'' \u2013 David Bowie |last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=4 August 2019|quote=...as well as the disco stylings of 'Golden Years.'|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424115507/https://www.allmusic.com/album/station-to-station-mw0000098920|archive-date=24 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> As the lead single of ''Station to Station'', the song is noted as musically different than the rest of its parent album.<ref name=\"Thompson AllMusic\">{{cite web |last1=Thompson |first1=Dave |title=\"Golden Years\" \u2013 David Bowie |url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/golden-years-mt0054050615 |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=1 April 2020}}</ref> While ''Station to Station'' is commonly regarded as the musical bridge between the funk and [[Soul music|soul]] of ''[[Young Americans]]'' to the experimental sound of his [[Berlin Trilogy]],{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}} \"Golden Years\" is the only song on the album to showcase the similar funk sound of ''Young Americans'' compared to, in Pegg's words, \"the steelier musical landscape\" of ''Station to Station''.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=175}}<ref name=\"Thompson AllMusic\" /> Pegg further comments that its American \"soul-pop\" roots are \"easily discernible\": he describes the main riff as \"owing a debt to\" the 1968 [[Cliff Nobles]] and Company song \"[[The Horse]]\" and the multi-tracked vocal refrain to 1958 single \"Happy Years\" by [[the Diamonds]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=175}} The song is in the key of B major and begins with a \"simple two-chord\" riff (F{{music|sharp}}\u2013E),{{sfn|Doggett|2012|pp=288\u2013289}} which Buckley believes hooks the listener in instantly.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=237}} Doggett calls the riff \"reminiscent\", albeit \"in very different circumstances\", to the [[Aladdin Sane (song)|title track]] of ''Aladdin Sane''.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=288}} According to Buckley, Bowie was looking to emulate something of the glitzy nostalgia of \"[[On Broadway (song)|On Broadway]]\", which he was playing on piano in the studio when he came up with \"Golden Years\".{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=237}} Doggett writes: \"The magical ingredients were percussive: the rattling of sticks against the hi-hat cymbal from the start, the startling clack of woodblocks, the sudden drum fills.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=289}} These elements combined \"channel\" the spirit of Elvis Presley in the verses, with a \"haughtier, more strident tone\" in the chorus.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=289}}\n\n==Release and aftermath==\n\"Golden Years\" was released on 21 November 1975 as the lead single to Bowie's tenth studio album ''[[Station to Station]]'' by [[RCA Records|RCA Victor]] (as RCA 2640/PB-10441) with the ''[[Young Americans]]'' track \"[[Can You Hear Me?

The original film score was written for the film by Hollywood composer [[Carter Burwell]]. One scene in the movie is a formal dance, which calls for courtly music based on Burwell's love theme to segue into David Bowie's song \"Golden Years\". It presented several challenges. First, the whole dance had been choreographed and filmed to an arbitrary tempo which begins at a slow courtly pace and speeds up and up until Bowie's song kicks in. Burwell had to match that tempo and the choreography after the fact and also find some credible path from a formal and restrained dance to a joyful '70s pop tune. They obtained Bowie's permission to pull tracks from his multitrack master of the song so they could mix these into Burwell's arrangement, helping to introduce his song before it has really begun. The end result is not on either of the CDs which were released (song or score soundtrack).

It was released in November 1975 as the lead single of his tenth studio album ''[[Station to Station]]'' (1976). It was the first track completed during the album's sessions, a period when Bowie's [[cocaine]] addiction was at its peak. At one stage it was slated to be the album's title track.\n\n==Composition and lyrics==\n\"Golden Years\" was the first track recorded for ''Station to Station'' in September 1975 at [[Cherokee Studios]] in Los Angeles.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|pp=236\u2013237}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=288}} Regarding the recording, co-producer [[Harry Maslin]] recalled that the song was \"cut and finished very fast. We knew it was absolutely right within ten days. But the rest of the album took forever.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=175}} At one stage it was slated to be the album's title track.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=175}} Sources differ as to who the track was written for. According to authors [[Nicholas Pegg]], David Buckley and Christopher Sandford, the track was supposedly written for [[Elvis Presley]] to cover, who turned it down.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|pp=236\u2013237}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=176}}{{sfn|Sandford|1998|p=146}} Bowie recalled that Presley had heard the demos and because both artists were signed to [[RCA Records]] at the time, Presley's manager [[Colonel Tom Parker]] thought that Bowie should write songs for Presley. Bowie stated that he had \"adored\" Presley and would have loved to work with him.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|pp=236\u2013237}} Although the artists' office contacted each other, nothing ever came to fruition. Presley sent a note to Bowie saying, \"All the best, and have a great tour\"; Bowie kept the note for the rest of his life.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|pp=236\u2013237}} Bowie's first wife [[Angie Bowie]] later claimed that the song was written for her,{{sfn|Sandford|1998|p=146}}{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=237}} saying that he sang the track over the telephone to her, \"just the way, all those years before, he'd sung me [the ''[[Aladdin Sane]]'' track] \"[[The Prettiest Star]]\". It had a similar effect. I bought it.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=176}} According to Sandford, Ava Cherry also claimed to have been the inspiration for the song.{{sfn|Sandford|1998|p=146}}\n\nMusically, \"Golden Years\" is a [[funk]] and [[disco]] song.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=288}}<ref name=\"Mojica CoS\">{{cite web | url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2010/10/album-review-david-bowie-station-to-statio/ | title=David Bowie \u2013 ''Station to Station'' [Special Edition] | website=[[Consequence of Sound]] | date=4 October 2010 | accessdate=1 June 2016 | last=Mojica |first= Frank | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160709192925/http://consequenceofsound.net/2010/10/album-review-david-bowie-station-to-statio/ | archive-date=9 July 2016 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"Erlewine AllMusic\">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/station-to-station-mw0000098920|title=''Station to Station'' \u2013 David Bowie |last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=4 August 2019|quote=...as well as the disco stylings of 'Golden Years.'|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424115507/https://www.allmusic.com/album/station-to-station-mw0000098920|archive-date=24 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> As the lead single of ''Station to Station'', the song is noted as musically different than the rest of its parent album.<ref name=\"Thompson AllMusic\">{{cite web |last1=Thompson |first1=Dave |title=\"Golden Years\" \u2013 David Bowie |url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/golden-years-mt0054050615 |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=1 April 2020}}</ref> While ''Station to Station'' is commonly regarded as the musical bridge between the funk and [[Soul music|soul]] of ''[[Young Americans]]'' to the experimental sound of his [[Berlin Trilogy]],{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}} \"Golden Years\" is the only song on the album to showcase the similar funk sound of ''Young Americans'' compared to, in Pegg's words, \"the steelier musical landscape\" of ''Station to Station''.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=175}}<ref name=\"Thompson AllMusic\" /> Pegg further comments that its American \"soul-pop\" roots are \"easily discernible\": he describes the main riff as \"owing a debt to\" the 1968 [[Cliff Nobles]] and Company song \"[[The Horse]]\" and the multi-tracked vocal refrain to 1958 single \"Happy Years\" by [[the Diamonds]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=175}} The song is in the key of B major and begins with a \"simple two-chord\" riff (F{{music|sharp}}\u2013E),{{sfn|Doggett|2012|pp=288\u2013289}} which Buckley believes hooks the listener in instantly.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=237}} Doggett calls the riff \"reminiscent\", albeit \"in very different circumstances\", to the [[Aladdin Sane (song)|title track]] of ''Aladdin Sane''.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=288}} According to Buckley, Bowie was looking to emulate something of the glitzy nostalgia of \"[[On Broadway (song)|On Broadway]]\", which he was playing on piano in the studio when he came up with \"Golden Years\".{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=237}} Doggett writes: \"The magical ingredients were percussive: the rattling of sticks against the hi-hat cymbal from the start, the startling clack of woodblocks, the sudden drum fills.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=289}} These elements combined \"channel\" the spirit of Elvis Presley in the verses, with a \"haughtier, more strident tone\" in the chorus.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=289}}\n\n==Release and aftermath==\n\"Golden Years\" was released on 21 November 1975 as the lead single to Bowie's tenth studio album ''[[Station to Station]]'' by [[RCA Records|RCA Victor]] (as RCA 2640/PB-10441) with the ''[[Young Americans]]'' track \"[[Can You Hear Me?

The original film score was written for the film by Hollywood composer [[Carter Burwell]]. One scene in the movie is a formal dance, which calls for courtly music based on Burwell's love theme to segue into David Bowie's song \"Golden Years\". It presented several challenges. First, the whole dance had been choreographed and filmed to an arbitrary tempo which begins at a slow courtly pace and speeds up and up until Bowie's song kicks in. Burwell had to match that tempo and the choreography after the fact and also find some credible path from a formal and restrained dance to a joyful '70s pop tune. They obtained Bowie's permission to pull tracks from his multitrack master of the song so they could mix these into Burwell's arrangement, helping to introduce his song before it has really begun. The end result is not on either of the CDs which were released (song or score soundtrack).
