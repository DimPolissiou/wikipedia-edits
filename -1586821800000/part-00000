The episode was written by [[Steven Levitan]] & [[Megan Ganz]], and directed by Steven Levitan.\n\nIn the episode, Claire waits for her flight back home while trying to get in touch with Haley after a fight they had.

She uses [[FaceTime]] to contact Phil ([[Ty Burrell]]), who tells her that he thinks Haley slept over at a friend's house. Meanwhile, Alex ([[Ariel Winter]]) continuously sends Claire new versions of her college essay for her to proof read, but Claire ignores them.\n\nWhile talking to Jay ([[Ed O'Neill]]), Claire gets a notification from [[Facebook]] that it also happens to be Mitchell's ([[Jesse Tyler Ferguson]]) birthday, so she FaceTimes him to wish him a good day. Knowing from Alex that Haley was baby sitting Lily ([[Aubrey Anderson-Emmons]]) the previous night, she asks Cameron ([[Eric Stonestreet]]) and Mitchell if they know where Haley is and they reveal that the last time they saw her was when she borrowed one of Mitchell's old blue suits. Lily tells her that Dylan ([[Reid Ewing]]) was there the previous night talking with Haley, something that surprises her since she was unaware that the two of them were still in touch.\n\nClaire uses her fake Facebook profile to view Haley's Facebook page and sees that Haley has changed her relationship status to \"Married\". Claire starts to panic while Phil tries to calm her down, but putting the clues together (borrowed old blue suit and being with Dylan) makes her believe that Haley married Dylan. She calls him but after talking to him, she knows that Dylan was to her relief, not the groom. Having no other way to find her, Claire hacks into Haley's [[iCloud]] account to track the GPS on her phone, much to Alex's disapproval. Claire searches the address on [[Google Maps]] which shows up on a street in [[Las Vegas]], next to a small [[wedding chapel]]. Claire panics even more and tries to think about whom Haley would end up married to, but she has no details about who Haley is dating.\n\nWhile talking to everyone; Mitchell, Cameron, Alex, Phil, Jay, Gloria ([[Sof\u00eda Vergara]]), Luke ([[Nolan Gould]]) and Manny ([[Rico Rodriguez (actor)|Rico Rodriguez]]), who reveal that Andy ([[Adam DeVine]]) has taken time off to go to Vegas for a wedding, Claire comes to the conclusion that Haley has married Andy without telling anyone. A parcel then arrives for Haley at the Dunphy household, which Phil opens. The parcel is revealed to be the book ''[[What to Expect When You're Expecting]]''. Claire panics once again that Haley might be pregnant and after her last attempts to get in contact with her or Andy, she closes all of her FaceTime windows to open a slideshow of Haley's childhood pictures, eats Cameron's popcorn, and cries while watching it.\n\nFeeling incredibly stressed by the situation, Claire FaceTimes her Dad, seeking his wisdom and to apologize for doing the same thing as Haley when she was her age. Jay reassures her that Haley being pregnant and married might not necessarily be a bad thing since when she did it years ago lead her to have a loving family with a good husband. Jay says this without knowing Phil is also listening, who is now crying and Jay tries to take back everything he said.\n\nClaire finally receives an incoming call from Haley, who has just woken up. It turns out that Haley was in the Dunphy's household asleep the whole time and is neither pregnant nor married; the suit was to lend to her friend who was getting married, her phone was accidentally left in Andy's car when he went on his trip to Vegas, her Facebook status was a joke about a \"[[Cronut]],\" and the pregnancy book was to help her design clothes for her boss's new fashion range. The family expresses their relief over the situation as Claire, when Haley immediately questions how her mother got onto her Facebook page and found out where her phone was, pretends to lose connection and log out of the FaceTime call, before leaving for her flight.\n\n==Production==\nThe original idea for the episode came from the producer of the show, [[Steven Levitan]], while he was talking to one of his college-aged daughters on FaceTime. \"I had emails open, some websites...then my daughter showed up. I could not only see her, but I could see me, and there was something going on behind me, my wife or somebody.

{"title_page": "Issue voting", "text_new": "{{voting images}}\n{{voting}}\n\nThe term '''issue voting''' describes when [[Voting|voters]] cast their vote in [[election]]s based on [[political issue]]s.<ref>Denver, 19</ref><ref>Nicholson, 11</ref> In the context of an election, issues include \"any questions of [[public policy]] which have been or are a matter of controversy and are sources of disagreement between [[political party|political parties]].\u201d<ref>Denver, 20</ref> According to the theory of issue voting, voters compare  the [[Candidate#Candidates in elections|candidates']] respective [[Value (personal and cultural)|principles]] against their own in order to decide for whom to vote.<ref>Denver, 21</ref><ref>Campbell, 98</ref>\n\n==Causes==\nA voter does not need to have an in-depth understanding of every issue and knowledge of how a [[candidate]] stands on every issue, but rather a sense of which candidate they agree with the most.<ref>Denver, 21</ref><ref>Nicholson, 132</ref> Voters use many different tactics to rationalize their view on a particular issue. Some people look at what has happened in the past and predict how they think a particular issue will affect them in the future.<ref>Denver, 20</ref>\n\nIssue voting is often contrasted with party voting. A 2010 [[University of California, Davis]] study found that voters switch between issue voting and party voting depending on how much information is available to them about a given candidate.<ref>Highton, 455-458</ref> [[Low information voter|Low-information elections]], such as those for [[Elections in the United States#Congressional elections|congressional candidates]], would thus be determined by [[Party politics|party voting]], whereas [[Elections in the United States#Presidential elections|presidential elections]], which tend to give voters much more information about each candidate, have the potential to be issue-driven.<ref>Enelow, 217-219</ref>\n\nVoters typically choose a political party to affiliate with in one of two ways.<ref>Denver, 20</ref> The voter will create an opinion of an issue without consulting what a political party thinks about it, then choose the political party that best fits the opinion they already have, or the voter will study the opinions of the different parties and decide which party he or she agrees with the most.<ref>Denver, 21</ref><ref>Campbell, 79, 98</ref><ref>Carmines, 78</ref>\n\nA voter's understanding of parties' principles is strengthened and developed over time as a person gains experience with more political events.<ref>Denver,21-23</ref> In order for an issue to create the foundation for [[Political party|party]] choice, a voter must first be concerned about a particular issue and have some knowledge about that issue.<ref>Moore, 245</ref>\n\nIn order for a person to be an issue voter, they must be able to recognize that there is more than one opinion about a particular issue, have formed a solid opinion about it and be able to relate that to a specific [[Political parties in the United States|political party]].<ref>Moore, 246</ref> According to Campbell, only 40 to 60 percent of the informed population even perceives party differences, and can thus partake in party voting.<ref>Campbell, 104</ref> This would suggest that it is common for individuals to develop opinions of issues without the aid of a political party.\n\n==History of issue voting==\nPrior to [[Paul Lazarsfeld|''The People's Choice'']] study in 1944, it was assumed by political scientists that voting was based solely on issues.<ref>Borre, 1, 2, 22</ref> However, this study found little evidence of issue voting in the [[1940 United States presidential election|United States presidential election of 1940]]. Rather, the researchers found that issues reinforced [[political party]] loyalties. Research stemming from the study concluded that voters' motivations could be broken down into three categories: [[party identification]], [[candidate]] orientation, and issue orientation. ''[[The American Voter]]'' in 1960 determined that party identification was the primary force, which in turn strongly influenced the other two categories. These three factors make up the Michigan School's approach to modeling voting behavior.<ref>Donsbach, \"Issue Voting\"</ref>\n\nSome of the earliest research on issue voting done in 1960 found that voters often did not have enough information to link specific issues to individual candidates.<ref>Campbell, 109-102</ref> Converse, in 1964, also concluded that voters did not have a sophisticated enough understanding of issues to be able to link them to candidates.<ref>Converse, 78-91</ref> In 1966, Key was one of the first people to conclude that voters are able to connect issues to certain candidates and cast their vote based on that information.<ref>Nicholson, 11</ref> Despite the growing knowledge of the field, reliable evidence didn't begin to appear until the 1970s. ''[[American Political Science Review]]'' published a symposium that hypothesized that there was a rise in issue voting in the 1960s. Nie and Anderson published an analysis of correlations with issue orientations in 1974 that attempted to revise the Michigan School's theory of the public's political belief systems' inherent limitations.<ref>Nie (1974) 541-591</ref> In 1979, Nie et all in ''The Changing American Voter'' attempted to explain the rise in issue voting through the fall in party voting.<ref>Nie 47-73</ref> This decline of party voting, they claimed, came about because the proportion of the electorate with no party affiliation had fallen, and because the proportion of voters who cast votes for candidates from other parties had risen.\n\n===Rise in issue voting===\nIn recent years, the United States has seen a rise in issue voting.  This can be attributed to the increased [[Political polarization|polarization]] in the last century between the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].<ref>McCarty et. al, 2</ref><ref>Nie, 172</ref>  Both of these parties have become more extreme in their issue viewpoints. This has alienated [[moderate]]s from their parties.<ref>McCarty et. al, 2</ref> Since a large portion of American voters are moderates, an increase has been seen in the number people who choose to affiliate as [[Independent (voter)|Independent]].<ref>McCarty et. al, 2</ref> \nIdentifying as an independent allows voters to avoid the constraints of a polarized political party. An independent voter can hand-pick a candidate based upon their positions on various issues rather than on their political party.<ref>Carmines and Stimson, 78-91</ref>\n\n[[Catholic Church|Catholics]] face the \"issue voting vs. party voting\" dilemma. Many Catholics support the [[opposition to legal abortion|pro-life]] stance which is backed by Republicans, but strongly oppose the [[capital punishment|death penalty]], which the Republican Party also supports. Extreme party polarization might cause Catholic voters to feel uncomfortable about both Republican and Democratic presidential candidates.<ref>McCarty et. al, 2</ref><ref>Nie, 172</ref>\n\nMembers of [[trade union|labor unions]] strongly identify with the Democratic Party's advocacy for workers' rights, but unions also tend to not support [[gay rights]], a stance which more closely aligns with Republican views.<ref>Frank, 25</ref>\n\n==Complications regarding issue voting==\nMany factors can complicate issue voting. First, issues are not always [[dichotomy|dichotomous]]; there are often many stances one could take.<ref>Nie, 158</ref><ref>Kessel, 460</ref> Voters often must settle for the candidate whose stances are closest to their own.<ref>Nie, 158</ref><ref>Kessel, 461</ref>  This can prove difficult when two or more candidates have similar opinions, or when candidates have positions that are equally far from a voter's. An example of an issue which might be difficult to issue vote on is [[Education in the United States|education]] spending. A voter may have a drastically different opinion from the available candidates on how much money should be spent on schools; this could lead the individual to vote based on party affiliation instead.<ref>Carmines and Stimson, 78-91</ref>\n\nA second complexity is that, oftentimes, problems do not line up on linear bases. That is, some issues may make it hard to even determine the candidate with the closest position.<ref>Nie, 158</ref><ref>Carmines and Stimson, 78-91</ref> For example, in the [[1980 United States presidential election|1980 US presidential election]] the growing threat of [[Communism]] in the [[Eastern Hemisphere]] was a salient issue for voters.<ref>Schweizer, 213</ref>  There were many proposed solutions to this problem; [[Ronald Reagan]] endorsed military intimidation through increased spending and innovation (the [[Reagan Doctrine]]), [[Jimmy Carter]] proposed diplomatic efforts to keep peace, and the independent [[John B. Anderson|John Anderson]] advocated a return to the [[containment]] strategy.<ref>Schweizer, 213</ref><ref>Kirkendall</ref><ref>Bisnow, 24</ref> None of these answers are [[mutually exclusive]], and they cannot be linearly plotted.  The voter would instead have to choose the candidate whose opinion represented the closest mix of possible solutions to their own.\n\nA third problem that can complicate issue voting is if there are multiple issues that are equally salient to the voter.<ref>Nie, 158</ref> A candidate may have a similar position to a given voter on one issue, but may take a considerably different stance on another.<ref>Nie, 158</ref><ref>Carmines and Stimson, 78-91</ref> An example of this occurred in the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 US presidential election]]. During this election, two issues dominating attention were the economy and the wars in [[War in Afghanistan (1978\u2013present)|Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq War|Iraq]]. Many viewed these issues as equally salient, and had a hard time picking one issue to vote on. These three complexities in issue voting have provided problems in using this tactic to choosing candidates.\n\nA fourth problem is that voters may be unsophisticated and lack the knowledge necessary to vote based on issues. Political scientist [[Larry Bartels]] has argued that voters are generally uninformed and that their actual vote choices do not reflect the vote choices that a fully informed voter would make. He concludes that since voters lack full information, they cannot truly be issue voters.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/la-oe-bartels3-2008nov03-story.html|title=How smart is the American voter?|date=2008-11-03|work=|publisher=LA Times|via=|last1=Bartels|first1=Larry M.|accessdate=26 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Models of issue voting==\nWhile scholars employ many models to study voting habits, there are three primary models used in statistical studies of issue voting: the linear position model, the spatial model and the salience model. Each model takes a different approach to issue voting into account.\n\n[[File:Linear Model of Issue Voting, April 2012.jpg|thumb|Linear Model of Issue Voting|right]]\n*The Linear Position Model attempts to predict how strongly an individual will issue vote in an election. The model suggests that the more a voter and candidate agree on a particular issue, the better chance the candidate has of receiving the individual's vote.<ref>Borre, 19</ref><ref>Meier and Campbell, 26-43</ref> In this model, a graph is used to display the relationship between the number of people voting for the party and the consistency of the issue position.<ref>Borre, 19</ref><ref>Meier and Campbell, 26-43</ref> The equation \u201cY = a + bX\u201d is used, where the variable \u201ca\u201d represents the minimal numbert of people voting for the party, \u201cb\u201d is a variable used to ensure that there is a positive gradient, \"X\" represents the consistency of the party's issue position, and Y represents the number of people who vote for the party.<ref>Borre, 20</ref><ref>Davis et. al, 426-429</ref>\n*The [[Spatial model of voting|Spatial Model]] attempts to show the perceptions and decisions of voters when issue voting strategies are used in elections.<ref>Cho, 275</ref> This model assumes that if someone\u2019s issue preferences are placed on a hypothetical spatial field along with all possible candidates\u2019 policy positions, the individual will vote for the candidate whose political stances are closest to their own.<ref>Rabinowitz, 94</ref><ref>McCullough,199-22</ref> Other models that follow the idea of \u201ccloseness\u201d are called proximity models.<ref>Rabinowitz, 93, 96</ref>\n*The Salience Model asserts that the two major parties in the [[United States]] are associated with certain goals or views on an issue, and that the voter\u2019s decision in selecting a candidate depends on the actual salience of the issue to the voter.<ref>Borre, 6</ref><ref>Campbell, 93</ref> This model is important when considering issue voting because it utilizes election agenda data to predict election outcome.<ref>Borre, 6</ref><ref>Niemi,1212</ref> A simple view of this model can be summarized with the equation:\n\n::Vote=a(Saliency of the party's issues)+b(Saliency of the party's issues)\n\n::where \"a\"=Party 1, and \"b\"=Party 2\n\n:The more important the issue becomes, the more a voter favors a particular candidate or party on the issue.<ref>Borre, 6</ref><ref>Davis et. al, 426</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Voting system]]\n*[[Experimental political science]]\n*[[Politics of the United States]]\n*[[Single-issue politics]]\n*[https://www.foodondeal.com/blog/food-farming-issues-presidential-election-2020/ Food & Farming Issues In Presidential Election 2020]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|3}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|indent=yes|30em}}\n:[[Bisnow Media|Bisnow, Mark]].

Some people look at what has happened in the past and predict how they think a particular issue will affect them in the future.<ref>Denver, 20</ref>\n\nIssue voting is often contrasted with party voting. A 2010 [[University of California, Davis]] study found that voters switch between issue voting and party voting depending on how much information is available to them about a given candidate.<ref>Highton, 455-458</ref> [[Low information voter|Low-information elections]], such as those for [[Elections in the United States#Congressional elections|congressional candidates]], would thus be determined by [[Party politics|party voting]], whereas [[Elections in the United States#Presidential elections|presidential elections]], which tend to give voters much more information about each candidate, have the potential to be issue-driven.<ref>Enelow, 217-219</ref>\n\nVoters typically choose a political party to affiliate with in one of two ways.<ref>Denver, 20</ref> The voter will create an opinion of an issue without consulting what a political party thinks about it, then choose the political party that best fits the opinion they already have, or the voter will study the opinions of the different parties and decide which party he or she agrees with the most.<ref>Denver, 21</ref><ref>Campbell, 79, 98</ref><ref>Carmines, 78</ref>\n\nA voter's understanding of parties' principles is strengthened and developed over time as a person gains experience with more political events.<ref>Denver,21-23</ref> In order for an issue to create the foundation for [[Political party|party]] choice, a voter must first be concerned about a particular issue and have some knowledge about that issue.<ref>Moore, 245</ref>\n\nIn order for a person to be an issue voter, they must be able to recognize that there is more than one opinion about a particular issue, have formed a solid opinion about it and be able to relate that to a specific [[Political parties in the United States|political party]].<ref>Moore, 246</ref> According to Campbell, only 40 to 60 percent of the informed population even perceives party differences, and can thus partake in party voting.<ref>Campbell, 104</ref> This would suggest that it is common for individuals to develop opinions of issues without the aid of a political party.\n\n==History of issue voting==\nPrior to [[Paul Lazarsfeld|''The People's Choice'']] study in 1944, it was assumed by political scientists that voting was based solely on issues.<ref>Borre, 1, 2, 22</ref> However, this study found little evidence of issue voting in the [[1940 United States presidential election|United States presidential election of 1940]]. Rather, the researchers found that issues reinforced [[political party]] loyalties. Research stemming from the study concluded that voters' motivations could be broken down into three categories: [[party identification]], [[candidate]] orientation, and issue orientation. ''[[The American Voter]]'' in 1960 determined that party identification was the primary force, which in turn strongly influenced the other two categories. These three factors make up the Michigan School's approach to modeling voting behavior.<ref>Donsbach, \"Issue Voting\"</ref>\n\nSome of the earliest research on issue voting done in 1960 found that voters often did not have enough information to link specific issues to individual candidates.<ref>Campbell, 109-102</ref> Converse, in 1964, also concluded that voters did not have a sophisticated enough understanding of issues to be able to link them to candidates.<ref>Converse, 78-91</ref> In 1966, Key was one of the first people to conclude that voters are able to connect issues to certain candidates and cast their vote based on that information.<ref>Nicholson, 11</ref> Despite the growing knowledge of the field, reliable evidence didn't begin to appear until the 1970s. ''[[American Political Science Review]]'' published a symposium that hypothesized that there was a rise in issue voting in the 1960s. Nie and Anderson published an analysis of correlations with issue orientations in 1974 that attempted to revise the Michigan School's theory of the public's political belief systems' inherent limitations.<ref>Nie (1974) 541-591</ref> In 1979, Nie et all in ''The Changing American Voter'' attempted to explain the rise in issue voting through the fall in party voting.<ref>Nie 47-73</ref> This decline of party voting, they claimed, came about because the proportion of the electorate with no party affiliation had fallen, and because the proportion of voters who cast votes for candidates from other parties had risen.\n\n===Rise in issue voting===\nIn recent years, the United States has seen a rise in issue voting.  This can be attributed to the increased [[Political polarization|polarization]] in the last century between the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].<ref>McCarty et. al, 2</ref><ref>Nie, 172</ref>  Both of these parties have become more extreme in their issue viewpoints. This has alienated [[moderate]]s from their parties.<ref>McCarty et. al, 2</ref> Since a large portion of American voters are moderates, an increase has been seen in the number people who choose to affiliate as [[Independent (voter)|Independent]].<ref>McCarty et. al, 2</ref> \nIdentifying as an independent allows voters to avoid the constraints of a polarized political party. An independent voter can hand-pick a candidate based upon their positions on various issues rather than on their political party.<ref>Carmines and Stimson, 78-91</ref>\n\n[[Catholic Church|Catholics]] face the \"issue voting vs. party voting\" dilemma. Many Catholics support the [[opposition to legal abortion|pro-life]] stance which is backed by Republicans, but strongly oppose the [[capital punishment|death penalty]], which the Republican Party also supports. Extreme party polarization might cause Catholic voters to feel uncomfortable about both Republican and Democratic presidential candidates.<ref>McCarty et. al, 2</ref><ref>Nie, 172</ref>\n\nMembers of [[trade union|labor unions]] strongly identify with the Democratic Party's advocacy for workers' rights, but unions also tend to not support [[gay rights]], a stance which more closely aligns with Republican views.<ref>Frank, 25</ref>\n\n==Complications regarding issue voting==\nMany factors can complicate issue voting. First, issues are not always [[dichotomy|dichotomous]]; there are often many stances one could take.<ref>Nie, 158</ref><ref>Kessel, 460</ref> Voters often must settle for the candidate whose stances are closest to their own.<ref>Nie, 158</ref><ref>Kessel, 461</ref>  This can prove difficult when two or more candidates have similar opinions, or when candidates have positions that are equally far from a voter's. An example of an issue which might be difficult to issue vote on is [[Education in the United States|education]] spending. A voter may have a drastically different opinion from the available candidates on how much money should be spent on schools; this could lead the individual to vote based on party affiliation instead.<ref>Carmines and Stimson, 78-91</ref>\n\nA second complexity is that, oftentimes, problems do not line up on linear bases. That is, some issues may make it hard to even determine the candidate with the closest position.<ref>Nie, 158</ref><ref>Carmines and Stimson, 78-91</ref> For example, in the [[1980 United States presidential election|1980 US presidential election]] the growing threat of [[Communism]] in the [[Eastern Hemisphere]] was a salient issue for voters.<ref>Schweizer, 213</ref>  There were many proposed solutions to this problem; [[Ronald Reagan]] endorsed military intimidation through increased spending and innovation (the [[Reagan Doctrine]]), [[Jimmy Carter]] proposed diplomatic efforts to keep peace, and the independent [[John B. Anderson|John Anderson]] advocated a return to the [[containment]] strategy.<ref>Schweizer, 213</ref><ref>Kirkendall</ref><ref>Bisnow, 24</ref> None of these answers are [[mutually exclusive]], and they cannot be linearly plotted.  The voter would instead have to choose the candidate whose opinion represented the closest mix of possible solutions to their own.\n\nA third problem that can complicate issue voting is if there are multiple issues that are equally salient to the voter.<ref>Nie, 158</ref> A candidate may have a similar position to a given voter on one issue, but may take a considerably different stance on another.<ref>Nie, 158</ref><ref>Carmines and Stimson, 78-91</ref> An example of this occurred in the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 US presidential election]]. During this election, two issues dominating attention were the economy and the wars in [[War in Afghanistan (1978\u2013present)|Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq War|Iraq]]. Many viewed these issues as equally salient, and had a hard time picking one issue to vote on. These three complexities in issue voting have provided problems in using this tactic to choosing candidates.\n\nA fourth problem is that voters may be unsophisticated and lack the knowledge necessary to vote based on issues. Political scientist [[Larry Bartels]] has argued that voters are generally uninformed and that their actual vote choices do not reflect the vote choices that a fully informed voter would make. He concludes that since voters lack full information, they cannot truly be issue voters.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/la-oe-bartels3-2008nov03-story.html|title=How smart is the American voter?|date=2008-11-03|work=|publisher=LA Times|via=|last1=Bartels|first1=Larry M.|accessdate=26 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Models of issue voting==\nWhile scholars employ many models to study voting habits, there are three primary models used in statistical studies of issue voting: the linear position model, the spatial model and the salience model. Each model takes a different approach to issue voting into account.\n\n[[File:Linear Model of Issue Voting, April 2012.jpg|thumb|Linear Model of Issue Voting|right]]\n*The Linear Position Model attempts to predict how strongly an individual will issue vote in an election. The model suggests that the more a voter and candidate agree on a particular issue, the better chance the candidate has of receiving the individual's vote.<ref>Borre, 19</ref><ref>Meier and Campbell, 26-43</ref> In this model, a graph is used to display the relationship between the number of people voting for the party and the consistency of the issue position.<ref>Borre, 19</ref><ref>Meier and Campbell, 26-43</ref> The equation \u201cY = a + bX\u201d is used, where the variable \u201ca\u201d represents the minimal numbert of people voting for the party, \u201cb\u201d is a variable used to ensure that there is a positive gradient, \"X\" represents the consistency of the party's issue position, and Y represents the number of people who vote for the party.<ref>Borre, 20</ref><ref>Davis et. al, 426-429</ref>\n*The [[Spatial model of voting|Spatial Model]] attempts to show the perceptions and decisions of voters when issue voting strategies are used in elections.<ref>Cho, 275</ref> This model assumes that if someone\u2019s issue preferences are placed on a hypothetical spatial field along with all possible candidates\u2019 policy positions, the individual will vote for the candidate whose political stances are closest to their own.<ref>Rabinowitz, 94</ref><ref>McCullough,199-22</ref> Other models that follow the idea of \u201ccloseness\u201d are called proximity models.<ref>Rabinowitz, 93, 96</ref>\n*The Salience Model asserts that the two major parties in the [[United States]] are associated with certain goals or views on an issue, and that the voter\u2019s decision in selecting a candidate depends on the actual salience of the issue to the voter.<ref>Borre, 6</ref><ref>Campbell, 93</ref> This model is important when considering issue voting because it utilizes election agenda data to predict election outcome.<ref>Borre, 6</ref><ref>Niemi,1212</ref> A simple view of this model can be summarized with the equation:\n\n::Vote=a(Saliency of the party's issues)+b(Saliency of the party's issues)\n\n::where \"a\"=Party 1, and \"b\"=Party 2\n\n:The more important the issue becomes, the more a voter favors a particular candidate or party on the issue.<ref>Borre, 6</ref><ref>Davis et. al, 426</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Voting system]]\n*[[Experimental political science]]\n*[[Politics of the United States]]\n*[[Single-issue politics]]\n*[[https://www.foodondeal.com/blog/food-farming-issues-presidential-election-2020/ Food & Farming Issues In Presidential Election 2020]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|3}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|indent=yes|30em}}\n:[[Bisnow Media|Bisnow, Mark]].

In this historical context, PRS comprises three stages equivalent to those subsumed within PRS: thesis (intellectual proposition, problem), antithesis (negation of the proposition, response to thesis), and synthesis (resolution of tension between proposition and reaction, resolution).

The league was an 18-team competition established in 1996 by [[Irvin Khoza]], [[Kaizer Motaung]], Raymond Hack and [[Jomo Sono]] in conjunction with the [[South African Football Association]] and it would run parallel to the European football calendar.\n\n==Season summary==\n[[Manning Rangers]] shocked all and sundry by comfortably finishing top of the log to win the first PSL title ahead of several more fancied opponents. The ''Mighty Maulers'' dominated to such an extent that they finished eight points clear of second placed [[Kaizer Chiefs]] and a further two ahead of [[Orlando Pirates]]. The Soweto duo were left well and truly trailing in the Durban club\u2019s dust.\n\nAdmittedly the ''Amakhosi'' had a more potent attack and a better defensive record than Rangers, and they lost fewer games, but their propensity to draw matches that they should have won cost them the trophy. It handed [[Gordon Igesund]] the first of four PSL titles that he would win in the competition and got South Africa\u2019s brand new top flight league off to a noteworthy start.\n\n[[Bush Bucks F.C. (1957)|Umtata Bush Bucks]] and [[Hellenic FC|Hellenic]] completed the top five, with [[Mamelodi Sundowns F.C.|Mamelodi Sundowns]] in sixth, [[Jomo Cosmos]] in seventh and [[Ajax Cape Town F.C.|Cape Town Spurs]] rounding off the top eight.\n\nPopular clubs [[Bloemfontein Celtic F.C.|Bloemfontein Celtic]] and [[Moroka Swallows F.C.|Moroka Swallows]] came in 10th and 11th respectively, not quite the start to the PSL era that their fans were hoping for, while KwaZulu-Natal giants [[AmaZulu F.C.|AmaZulu]] could only finish 14th on the 18-team log.\n\nThe first two teams to suffer the ignominy of relegation to the second tier from the PSL were [[Mpumalanga Black Aces F.C.|Witbank Aces]] \u2013 who won just four games all season and finished with a measly 19 points \u2013 and [[Michau Warriors]]. '''Real Rovers''' and [[Vaal Professionals]] (36 points each) were desperately lucky to finish just a single point ahead of Warriors and avoid the dreaded chop.\n\nThe only blot on the inaugural PSL season, although through no fault of its own, would be the abandoned game between Bloemfontein Celtic and Kaizer Chiefs on Sunday 16 February 1997. The game in Bloemfontein was called off in the 40th minute with the home side trailing Chiefs 2-0 due to crowd trouble. Kaizer Chiefs were given the result along with 3 log points due to the trouble with the crowd being instigated by the Celtic fans. This was a rather surprising turn of events as the Celtic fans, while having a reputation for being extremely vocal and passionate, are not known to be unruly.\n\n==Final league table==\n{{#invoke:sports table|main|style=WDL\n|res_col_header=QR\n\n|team1=MAN|name_MAN=[[Manning Rangers]]\n|team2=KAI|name_KAI=[[Kaizer Chiefs]]\n|team3=ORL|name_ORL=[[Orlando Pirates]]\n|team4=UMT|name_UMT=[[Bush Bucks F.C.

It received mixed reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nArchitect-turned-recluse Bernadette Fox ([[Cate Blanchett]])  is settled down with her husband Elgin ([[Billy Crudup]]) and their daughter Bee ([[Emma Nelson]]). She hates people, she hates leaving the house, and more than anything, she hates the other parents at her 15-year-old daughter Bee's school. She also doesn't get along with her neighbor Audrey Griffin ([[Kristen Wiig]]).\n\nBernadette has a personal assistant named Manjula in India with whom she regularly communicates. One day, she finds Elgin, Dr. Kurtz ([[Judy Greer]]), and an FBI agent in home for intervention, who tell her that Manjula has been an agent for Russian hacker who has Bernadette\u2019s personal information and planning to defraud her and Elgin.\n\nBernadette starts to behave oddly, concerning everyone. With Audrey's help, after buring hatchet, Bernadette flies to Antarctica. There, Bernadette reconnects with her love for architecture and plans to work on a station.\n\nMeanwhile, Manjula is arrested at the airport and before agent can give the good news, Elgin and Bee head off to Antarctica to find Bernadette. After finding her at the station, they realize her desires and dream and support her with working at the station.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Cate Blanchett]] as Bernadette Fox\n* [[Billy Crudup]] as Elgin Branch\n* Emma Nelson as Bee Branch\n* [[Kristen Wiig]] as Audrey Griffin\n* [[James Urbaniak]] as Marcus Strang\n* [[Judy Greer]] as Dr. Janelle Kurtz\n* [[Troian Bellisario]] as Becky\n* [[Zo\u00eb Chao]] as Soo-Lin Lee-Segal\n* [[Laurence Fishburne]] as Paul Jellinek\n* [[Claudia Doumit]] as Iris\n* Katelyn Statton as Vivian\n* [[Steve Zahn]] as David Walker\n* [[Megan Mullally]] as Judy Toll\n* Richard Robichaux as Floyd the pharmacist\n* [[J\u00f3hannes Haukur J\u00f3hannesson]] as Captain J.

Whittock was also accused of having coughed after Ingram mentioned an incorrect option to his penultimate question and swiftly following that up with a smothered \"No\". But Plaskett, who had sat in that very same seat, argued that he might have audibly said it in response to an incorrect option in the same way that other waiting contestants have been known to whisper \"No\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/jul/17/couldthewhowantstobeami|title=Are the Millionaire three innocent?|last=Ronson|first=Jon|date=17 July 2006|work=The Guardian|accessdate=17 August 2014|location=London}}</ref>\n\nA book covering the case, ''Bad Show: The Quiz, The Cough, The Millionaire Major'', by [[Bob Woffinden]] and James Plaskett was published in January 2015.

The prosecution alleged that, of the 192 coughs recorded during his second-night performance, 32 were recorded from the ten Fastest Finger First contestants, and that 19 of the 32 coughs heard on the video tape were \"significant\". The prosecution asserted that these \"significant\" coughs were by Whittock, each falling any time the correct answer had been spoken.

Ronson, who attended every day of the trial, had observed that when the word \"cough\" was mentioned, pensioners in the public gallery had coughed. [[James Plaskett]], who had appeared on ''Millionaire'' several times before winning \u00a3250,000 in January 2006, argued this was an example of coughs caused by unconscious triggers; Whittock had simply coughed involuntarily when he heard the correct answer. Whittock was also accused of having coughed after Ingram mentioned an incorrect option to his penultimate question and swiftly following that up with a smothered \"No\". But Plaskett, who had sat in that very same seat, argued that he might have audibly said it in response to an incorrect option in the same way that other waiting contestants have been known to whisper \"No\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/jul/17/couldthewhowantstobeami|title=Are the Millionaire three innocent?|last=Ronson|first=Jon|date=17 July 2006|work=The Guardian|accessdate=17 August 2014|location=London}}</ref>\n\nA book covering the case, ''Bad Show: The Quiz, The Cough, The Millionaire Major'', by [[Bob Woffinden]] and James Plaskett was published in January 2015.

A video recording, with coughing amplified relative to other sounds including Ingram's and Tarrant's voices, was prepared by Celador's editors (Editworks) for the prosecution and \"for the benefit of the jury\" during the trial (and later for viewers in television broadcasts). Ingram claims that he neither \"listened for, encouraged, nor noticed any coughing\". The prosecution alleged that, of the 192 coughs recorded during his second-night performance, 32 were recorded from the ten Fastest Finger First contestants, and that 19 of the 32 coughs heard on the video tape were \"significant\". The prosecution asserted that these \"significant\" coughs were by Whittock, each falling any time the correct answer had been spoken. During the trial, Tarrant also denied hearing any coughing throughout the episode, claiming he was too busy to notice.<ref name=\"scotsman\">{{cite news |url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/uk-news/quizmaster-amazed-to-hear-163-1m-winner-could-have-cheated-1-598995 |title=Quizmaster 'amazed' to hear \u00a31m winner could have cheated |date=13 March 2003 |accessdate=13 May 2008 |location=Edinburgh |work=The Scotsman |first=Karen |last=Mcveigh}}</ref>\n\n====Testimony of Larry Whitehurst====\nLarry Whitehurst, another contestant who had appeared on the show as a Fastest Finger First contestant on four occasions, was adamant that he had known the answers to Ingram's questions.

Ingram had failed to tell [[Direct Line]] Insurance about claims he had made in the three years before he took out the policy in July 2001.
