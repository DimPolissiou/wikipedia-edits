As the line passes through the Cascade range, it passes through a number of ecoregions, first getting higher and colder, then getting warmer, yet drier. Each of these component ecoregions can be described by either a tree [[indicator species]], or by a lack of trees: [[western hemlock]], [[Pacific silver fir]], subalpine [[mountain hemlock]], [[Alpine tundra|alpine]], [[Abies lasiocarpa|subalpine fir]], and [[grand fir]]/[[Douglas fir]].<ref name=\"Kruckeberg\" />\n\n==Western Hemlock Ecoregion==\n[[File:Coal Creek Falls 04048.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Coal Creek Falls and surrounding thick vegetation in the [[Cougar Mountain Regional Wildland Park]].]]\nThe Western Hemlock Ecoregion huddles in the lower west-side elevations of the North Cascades.

Mountain hemlock trees live as long as 1000 years: longer than the Pacific silver fir. Trees between 500\u2013700 years may be {{convert|100|to|125|ft|m|-1}} tall.<ref name=\"Kruckeberg\" /> Hemlock cones are about {{convert|2|-|3|in|cm|0}} in length and develop at the ends of branches.<ref name=\"Kruckeberg\" /> These conifers are easy to distinguish amongst the others with their dense grayish-green needles.<ref name=\"Kruckeberg\" /> According to Franklin and Dyrness, the understory where the mountain hemlock and Pacific silver fir co-dominate is dominated by tall mountain [[huckleberry]]; where the Alaska cedar dominates, the understory is dominated by dense collage of [[rhododendron]], huckleberry and [[Sorbus|mountain ash]].<ref name=\"Kruckeberg\" />\n\nIn the higher boundaries of subalpine ecosystem, where the abiotic conditions are more stressful, trees are clumped together in patchy islands. Trees in this area can be recognized by its [[krummholz]] form.  Trees of this upper boundary will take on a flag appearance with branches extending from one side indicating the prevailing wind directions.  The skirt height of the trees is indicative of the height of snow cover where branches tend not to grow.<ref name=\"Kruckeberg\" /> There are various reasons as to why these trees take this form.  Strong winds combined with ice particles will cause abrasion scouring the waxy cuticle from one side of the tree creating damage that will prevent branch formation and growth.<ref name=\"Kruckeberg\" /> In addition, the wind will cause desiccation and evaporation in the needles causing branches to die on this side of the trees.  \n[[File:Penstemon davidsonii 9224.JPG|thumb|left|upright|''[[Penstemon|Penstemon davidsonii]]'' in [[Mount Pilchuck State Park]] at {{convert|5300|ft|m}}.]]\n  \nScattered amongst the island patches of trees in the upper boundaries are parkland areas with showy meadows.  Events such as fire, avalanches, snow slumping and climate change make the boundaries of these areas and the balance of trees and meadows dynamic.<ref name=\"Johnson\" /> The forest islands typically consist of mountain hemlock, [[subalpine fir]], and Alaska cedar.<ref name=\"Kruckeberg\" /> Often there are invasions of trees into meadow areas and this reached a peak in the 1930s due to considerable warming.<ref name=\"Kruckeberg\" /> Invasions of meadows by trees can also occur with disturbances.\n\nThe beauty of meadows is very popular amongst hikers.

The amount of solar radiation and UV exposure can vary substantially in our northern latitude largely based on the time of day, slope, season, cloud cover and vegetation.<ref name=\"Kruckeberg\" /> Temperatures adjust accordingly to this solar radiation and exposure.  The parklands of this montane region have a much larger range of temperatures as compared to the hemlock forests.<ref name=\"Kruckeberg\" /> The range can be as much as {{convert|50|F-change|C-change}} while the range in the forests rarely exceeds {{convert|20|F-change|C-change}}.<ref name=\"Kruckeberg\" /> This is due to the canopy of the trees, creating a much more protected environment as compared to the open meadows.  In addition soil temperatures directly impact biological activity affecting soil organisms and root systems.<ref name=\"Kruckeberg\" /> Daily and season temperature changes greatly affect the soils' heat loss and gain.<ref name=\"Kruckeberg\" /> However, the snowpack acts as an insulating buffer against temperature change in soils.<ref name=\"Kruckeberg\" /> The mountain hemlock forests are the wettest and coldest of the Cascade forest zones.<ref name=\"Kruckeberg\" />\n    \nIn the richness of this region many animal species pass through this zone at least one season a year such as [[mountain goat]], [[black-tailed deer]], [[American black bear]], [[elk]], [[cougar]], and many bird species.<ref name=\"Kruckeberg\" /> Only the whistling [[hoary marmot]] is restricted to alpine and subalpine areas.<ref name=\"Kruckeberg\" /> Besides the richness of mammals there is a richness of insects that are integral to the abundance of flowering plant species in this area.<ref name=\"Kruckeberg\" /> Another important pollinator in this area is the [[hummingbird]].<ref name=\"Kruckeberg\" /> There is still much to be researched and discovered to better understand species interactions and reliance in both the alpine and subalpine ecosystems.\n\n==Alpine Ecoregion==\n[[File:Mount Daniel 27801.JPG|thumb|right|[[Mount Daniel]], looking up from {{convert|6100|ft|m|-2}}.]]\nThe Alpine Ecoregion makes up much of the North Cascades.   Alpine areas such as this are rugged with rocky ridges, [[snowfield]]s, partially vegetated terrain, and are above the natural [[treeline]].<ref name=\"Johnson\" /> The timberline in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness is found at approximately {{convert|6000|ft|m|-2}}.<ref name=\"alwplan\" />  The average annual temperature is {{convert|37.5|F|C|0}} with only a mean annual precipitation of {{convert|46|cm|in}}.<ref name=\"wgold\" /> These conditions along with winds and blowing ice are not conducive for trees. Because of the extreme temperatures and low precipitation there are few plant species as compared to lower elevation ecosystems and they are simpler in structure.<ref name=\"alwplan\" /> However, precipitation, or lack thereof, is a more important limiting factor than temperature.<ref name=\"alwplan\" /> Both plant and animal species have adapted in many different ways to deal with this challenging environment.  \n       \nThis high elevation habitat of high winds, prolonged snow cover, steep terrain, high temperature variability, and intense UV radiation lead to special species [[adaptation]]s.<ref name=\"Johnson\" /> Alpine regions generally have hypoxic conditions that lead to additional energy expenses for organisms.<ref name=\"Johnson\" /> Increased elevations usually lead to shorter breeding season in animals, as is the case in the alpine ecosystems in the North Cascades.  In addition to the shorter breeding season, wildlife often requires seasonal movement to different elevations in order to find adequate food and habitat.<ref name=\"Johnson\" /> However, species such as the [[white-tailed ptarmigan]], [[hoary marmot]]s, and [[pika]]s remain in high elevations of the Cascades year round left only to go to patchy and scattered alpine vegetation.  The majority of species will move to lower elevations at some time throughout their life history.  Adaptations such as torpor in hummingbirds, the ability of mountain goats and coyotes to camouflage in the landscape, animals developing extra fat deposits, and the raptor's ability to move efficiently in the strong winds illustrate just some of the ways species have been ability to cope with alpine conditions.<ref name=\"Johnson\" /> The white-tailed ptarmigan has an adaption of changing its plumage from  white in the winter to brown in the summer in order to camouflage.<ref name=\"Johnson\" /> Many species in higher elevations produce fewer offspring than in lower elevations but spend more time nurturing their young.<ref name=\"Johnson\" />\n[[File:Lagopus leucurus 7191.JPG|thumb|left|A white-tailed ptarmigan blends into the alpine tundra east of [[Glacier Peak]].]]\n     \nWhile alpine ecosystems provide challenging abiotic conditions for species there are advantages to animal species to habituate these areas.  In the winter while there is extensive snow pack there are also strong winds that will expose herbaceous stems and seeds for animals to forage on.<ref name=\"Johnson\" /> Insects that are blown up from lower elevations will land on the snow beds in the spring offering much nutrition for birds and other mammals that breed in the alpine.<ref name=\"Johnson\" /> When snowfields melt it creates a gradient of plant [[phenology]] which provides emerging vegetation over a period of time for herbivores to feed on and migrate along this line.  Spring foraging is believed to be crucial in the breeding in a number of species such as the mountain goat.<ref name=\"Johnson\" /> Leaf budding and fruiting  in late summer past the edges of snowfields also offer food for the animals that depend  on this area.<ref name=\"Johnson\" /> [[American black bear|Black bear]]s, songbirds and marmots in the North Cascades and Alpine Lakes can find cover in lush vegetation in avalanche chutes adjacent to the subalpine forests.<ref name=\"Johnson\" /> There seems to also be evidence that there is a lower rate of parasitism and disease in these  high alpine elevations offering yet another advantage to alpine species.  The alpine [[grouse]] is one example of an alpine animal that has few blood infections or intestinal parasites.<ref name=\"Johnson\" /> Other animal species in the summer months will migrate into the higher alpine elevations to avoid insects and forage in the meadows.<ref name=\"Johnson\" />\n\n==Subalpine Fir Ecoregion==\n[[File:SubalpineLarch 7717l.jpg|thumb|right|Patchy forest of subalpine fir, mountain hemlock, and subalpine larch at {{convert|6200|ft|m|-2}} in the [[Wenatchee Mountains]].]]\nThe Subalpine Fir Ecoregion, descending down the east-side of the Cascade Range, reaches elevations between {{convert|4200|-|6000|ft|m|-2}}.<ref name=\"wgold\" /> This area has the same mean annual temperature of {{convert|39|F|C}} as the Mountain Hemlock Ecoregion, but a drastically lower annual average precipitation of between {{convert|100|-|150|cm|in|-1}} with a much larger portion falling as snow rather than as rain.<ref name=\"wgold\" /> The ecosystems in this ecoregion are the [[subalpine fir]] forests, [[subalpine meadow]]s, avalanche gullies, and freshwater wetlands, streams and lakes.<ref name=\"wgold\">{{cite web|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/wgold/bis358/012808.pdf|last=Gold|first=W.|title=BIS258 lecture notes|publisher=University of Washington|date=2008-01-28|accessdate=2009-03-15}}</ref>\n       \nThe subalpine fir forests in the North Cascades include [[Douglas fir]], [[Engelmann spruce]], [[subalpine larch]], and [[whitebark pine]].<ref name=\"wgold\" /> The Engelmann spruce and the subalpine fir are commonly found together.

Trees in this area can be recognized by its [[krummholz]] form.  Trees of this upper boundary will take on a flag appearance with branches extending from one side indicating the prevailing wind directions.  The skirt height of the trees is indicative of the height of snow cover where branches tend not to grow.<ref name=\"Kruckeberg\" /> There are various reasons as to why these trees take this form.  Strong winds combined with ice particles will cause abrasion scouring the waxy cuticle from one side of the tree creating damage that will prevent branch formation and growth.<ref name=\"Kruckeberg\" /> In addition, the wind will cause desiccation and evaporation in the needles causing branches to die on this side of the trees.  \n[[File:Penstemon davidsonii 9224.JPG|thumb|left|upright|''[[Penstemon|Penstemon davidsonii]]'' in [[Mount Pilchuck State Park]] at {{convert|5300|ft|m}}.]]\n  \nScattered amongst the island patches of trees in the upper boundaries are parkland areas with showy meadows.

The amount of solar radiation and UV exposure can vary substantially in our northern latitude largely based on the time of day, slope, season, cloud cover and vegetation.<ref name=\"Kruckeberg\" /> Temperatures adjust accordingly to this solar radiation and exposure.  The parklands of this montane region have a much larger range of temperatures as compared to the hemlock forests.<ref name=\"Kruckeberg\" /> The range can be as much as {{convert|50|F-change|C-change}} while the range in the forests rarely exceeds {{convert|20|F-change|C-change}}.<ref name=\"Kruckeberg\" /> This is due to the canopy of the trees, creating a much more protected environment as compared to the open meadows.  In addition soil temperatures directly impact biological activity affecting soil organisms and root systems.<ref name=\"Kruckeberg\" /> Daily and season temperature changes greatly affect the soils' heat loss and gain.<ref name=\"Kruckeberg\" /> However, the snowpack acts as an insulating buffer against temperature change in soils.<ref name=\"Kruckeberg\" /> The mountain hemlock forests are the wettest and coldest of the Cascade forest zones.<ref name=\"Kruckeberg\" />\n    \nIn the richness of this region many animal species pass through this zone at least one season a year such as [[mountain goat]], [[black-tailed deer]], [[American black bear]], [[elk]], [[cougar]], and many bird species.<ref name=\"Kruckeberg\" /> Only the whistling [[hoary marmot]] is restricted to alpine and subalpine areas.<ref name=\"Kruckeberg\" /> Besides the richness of mammals there is a richness of insects that are integral to the abundance of flowering plant species in this area.<ref name=\"Kruckeberg\" /> Another important pollinator in this area is the [[hummingbird]].<ref name=\"Kruckeberg\" /> There is still much to be researched and discovered to better understand species interactions and reliance in both the alpine and subalpine ecosystems.\n\n==Alpine Ecoregion==\n[[File:Mount Daniel 27801.JPG|thumb|right|[[Mount Daniel]], looking up from {{convert|6100|ft|m|-2}}.]]\nThe Alpine Ecoregion makes up much of the North Cascades.   Alpine areas such as this are rugged with rocky ridges, [[snowfield]]s, partially vegetated terrain, and are above the natural [[treeline]].<ref name=\"Johnson\" /> The timberline in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness is found at approximately {{convert|6000|ft|m|-2}}.<ref name=\"alwplan\" />  The average annual temperature is {{convert|37.5|F|C|0}} with only a mean annual precipitation of {{convert|46|cm|in}}.<ref name=\"wgold\" /> These conditions along with winds and blowing ice are not conducive for trees. Because of the extreme temperatures and low precipitation there are few plant species as compared to lower elevation ecosystems and they are simpler in structure.<ref name=\"alwplan\" /> However, precipitation, or lack thereof, is a more important limiting factor than temperature.<ref name=\"alwplan\" /> Both plant and animal species have adapted in many different ways to deal with this challenging environment.  \n       \nThis high elevation habitat of high winds, prolonged snow cover, steep terrain, high temperature variability, and intense UV radiation lead to special species [[adaptation]]s.<ref name=\"Johnson\" /> Alpine regions generally have hypoxic conditions that lead to additional energy expenses for organisms.<ref name=\"Johnson\" /> Increased elevations usually lead to shorter breeding season in animals, as is the case in the alpine ecosystems in the North Cascades.  In addition to the shorter breeding season, wildlife often requires seasonal movement to different elevations in order to find adequate food and habitat.<ref name=\"Johnson\" /> However, species such as the [[white-tailed ptarmigan]], [[hoary marmot]]s, and [[pika]]s remain in high elevations of the Cascades year round left only to go to patchy and scattered alpine vegetation.  The majority of species will move to lower elevations at some time throughout their life history.  Adaptations such as torpor in hummingbirds, the ability of mountain goats and coyotes to camouflage in the landscape, animals developing extra fat deposits, and the raptor's ability to move efficiently in the strong winds illustrate just some of the ways species have been ability to cope with alpine conditions.<ref name=\"Johnson\" /> The white-tailed ptarmigan has an adaption of changing its plumage from  white in the winter to brown in the summer in order to camouflage.<ref name=\"Johnson\" /> Many species in higher elevations produce fewer offspring than in lower elevations but spend more time nurturing their young.<ref name=\"Johnson\" />\n[[File:Lagopus leucurus 7191.JPG|thumb|left|A white-tailed ptarmigan blends into the alpine tundra east of [[Glacier Peak]].]]\n     \nWhile alpine ecosystems provide challenging abiotic conditions for species there are advantages to animal species to habituate these areas.  In the winter while there is extensive snow pack there are also strong winds that will expose herbaceous stems and seeds for animals to forage on.<ref name=\"Johnson\" /> Insects that are blown up from lower elevations will land on the snow beds in the spring offering much nutrition for birds and other mammals that breed in the alpine.<ref name=\"Johnson\" /> When snowfields melt it creates a gradient of plant [[phenology]] which provides emerging vegetation over a period of time for herbivores to feed on and migrate along this line.  Spring foraging is believed to be crucial in the breeding in a number of species such as the mountain goat.<ref name=\"Johnson\" /> Leaf budding and fruiting  in late summer past the edges of snowfields also offer food for the animals that depend  on this area.<ref name=\"Johnson\" /> [[American black bear|Black bear]]s, songbirds and marmots in the North Cascades and Alpine Lakes can find cover in lush vegetation in avalanche chutes adjacent to the subalpine forests.<ref name=\"Johnson\" /> There seems to also be evidence that there is a lower rate of parasitism and disease in these  high alpine elevations offering yet another advantage to alpine species.  The alpine [[grouse]] is one example of an alpine animal that has few blood infections or intestinal parasites.<ref name=\"Johnson\" /> Other animal species in the summer months will migrate into the higher alpine elevations to avoid insects and forage in the meadows.<ref name=\"Johnson\" />\n\n==Subalpine Fir Ecoregion==\n[[File:SubalpineLarch 7717l.jpg|thumb|right|Patchy forest of subalpine fir, mountain hemlock, and subalpine larch at {{convert|6200|ft|m|-2}} in the [[Wenatchee Mountains]].]]\nThe Subalpine Fir Ecoregion, descending down the east-side of the Cascade Range, reaches elevations between {{convert|4200|-|6000|ft|m|-2}}.<ref name=\"wgold\" /> This area has the same mean annual temperature of {{convert|39|F|C}} as the Mountain Hemlock Ecoregion, but a drastically lower annual average precipitation of between {{convert|100|-|150|cm|in|-1}} with a much larger portion falling as snow rather than as rain.<ref name=\"wgold\" /> The ecosystems in this ecoregion are the [[subalpine fir]] forests, [[subalpine meadow]]s, avalanche gullies, and freshwater wetlands, streams and lakes.<ref name=\"wgold\">{{cite web|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/wgold/bis358/012808.pdf|last=Gold|first=W.|title=BIS258 lecture notes|publisher=University of Washington|date=2008-01-28|accessdate=2009-03-15}}</ref>\n       \nThe subalpine fir forests in the North Cascades include [[Douglas fir]], [[Engelmann spruce]], [[subalpine larch]], and [[whitebark pine]].<ref name=\"wgold\" /> The Engelmann spruce and the subalpine fir are commonly found together.

It is headquartered in Belgrade, Serbia.  Since it was established in 1947, the Institute of International Politics and Economics has had a special place in the academic life of the country. From a small group of researchers who laid foundations of the Yugoslav science of international relations, the Institute has gradually turned into the largest scientific institution in the country and one of the most reputable research and Para-diplomatic centres in the world. The Institute studies the processes and phenomena in the field of international politics and economics, this also including legal aspects of international relations, which are of interest for the position and foreign policy of the State.\n\nDevelopment and inclusion of Serbia into modern political, economic, legal, cultural and educational trends in the coming period will require a wider differentiation of tasks in the field of scientific education and research of foreign policy, the economy and international law. The interest of the Institute is to maintain its dominant position in the above scientific sphere in the future, but also to encourage the activities of other scientific institutions for dealing with foreign policy, economic and international legal issues.\n\n==History==\n\nThe Institute of International Politics and Economics was established on 7 December 1947 by  the Government of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia. In these first days of its existence, the Institute has provided an objective scientific basis for determining the overall strategy of foreign policy of former Yugoslavia that the realization of the independent position has been conditio sine qua non  for preservation the cohesion of the new federal structure of the state and the construction of a socialist society. In that period the Institute has become one of the birthplaces of the idea for the establishment of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]].<ref name=\"Politika-9.12.2016.\"/> In the period after that, the Institute has several times changed its legal status (Law on the Institute for International Politics and Economics, \"Official Gazette of SFRY\", No. 11/1974, The Regulation on the Federal Public Institution - Institute for International Politics and Economics, \"Official Gazette\", Nos. 11/1997, 5/2002). After the breakup of Yugoslavia and the disintegration of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro, the Institute ceased to function as institutions of federal importance. With the Government Decision on the exercise of founding rights in public enterprises, public institutions and organizations in which the founder's rights was the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia\", No. 49/2006), the Institute came under the jurisdiction of the Serbian Ministry of Science and Technological Development (Law on Scientific Research, \"Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia\" No. 110/2005, 50/2006 - corr. and 18/2010)<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dimitrijevi\u0107 |first1=Du\u0161ko |title=\"Institute of International Politics and Economics (IIPE)\" |journal=Journal on European perspectives at the Western Balkans |volume=VII |issue=1(12) |pages=5\u201323 |url=https://www.cep.si/research/european-perspectives-journal/ |issn=1855-7694}}</ref>\n\nDuring its existence, the Institute of International Politics and Economics has proven to be a scientific research institution of special social and national interest. Associates of the Institute were engaged in the study of important issues in the field of foreign policy, international economy and international law. For many years, the Institute of International Politics and Economics has been the center of the study of international relations.\n\nIn 2017, the IIPE received the Sretenje Order of the President of the Republic of Serbia for a special contribution to the study of international relations, marking the 70th anniversary of the Institute.<ref name=\"PresidentNikoli\u0107\">{{cite journal | language = |title = \u0423\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0438 \u043e \u043e\u0434\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430\u045a\u0438\u043c\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u0458\u0435 \u0458\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438\u043a \u0420\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0435 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0458\u0435 \u0422\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432 \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0438\u045b | author =  | pages = | publisher  = [[President of Serbia|People\u00b4s Office of the President]] | journal =  | volume = | number = |date= | location = [[Belgrade]] | url = https://www.predsednik.rs/predsednik/ukazi-o-odlikovanjima | accessdate = 15 September 2018 }}</ref>\n\n==List of Directors==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! {{Abbr|No.|Number}}\n! colspan=2 | Director<ref name=\"Direktori\">{{cite journal | language =  |title = History and Mission | author =  | pages = | publisher  = Institute of International Politics and Economics | journal = | volume = | number = |date= | location = [[Belgrade]] | url = https://www.diplomacy.bg.ac.rs/index_en.php | accessdate = 15 September 2018 }}</ref>\n! colspan=2 | Term of office<ref name=\"Direktori\"/>\n!

It is headquartered in Belgrade, Serbia.  Since it was established in 1947, the Institute of International Politics and Economics has had a special place in the academic life of the country. From a small group of researchers who laid foundations of the Yugoslav science of international relations, the Institute has gradually turned into the largest scientific institution in the country and one of the most reputable research and Para-diplomatic centres in the world. The Institute studies the processes and phenomena in the field of international politics and economics, this also including legal aspects of international relations, which are of interest for the position and foreign policy of the State.\n\nDevelopment and inclusion of Serbia into modern political, economic, legal, cultural and educational trends in the coming period will require a wider differentiation of tasks in the field of scientific education and research of foreign policy, the economy and international law. The interest of the Institute is to maintain its dominant position in the above scientific sphere in the future, but also to encourage the activities of other scientific institutions for dealing with foreign policy, economic and international legal issues.\n\n==History==\n\nThe Institute of International Politics and Economics was established on 7 December 1947 by  the Government of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia. In these first days of its existence, the Institute has provided an objective scientific basis for determining the overall strategy of foreign policy of former Yugoslavia that the realization of the independent position has been conditio sine qua non  for preservation the cohesion of the new federal structure of the state and the construction of a socialist society. In that period the Institute has become one of the birthplaces of the idea for the establishment of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]].<ref name=\"Politika-9.12.2016.\"/> In the period after that, the Institute has several times changed its legal status (Law on the Institute for International Politics and Economics, \"Official Gazette of SFRY\", No. 11/1974, The Regulation on the Federal Public Institution - Institute for International Politics and Economics, \"Official Gazette\", Nos. 11/1997, 5/2002). After the breakup of Yugoslavia and the disintegration of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro, the Institute ceased to function as institutions of federal importance. With the Government Decision on the exercise of founding rights in public enterprises, public institutions and organizations in which the founder's rights was the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (\"Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia\", No. 49/2006), the Institute came under the jurisdiction of the Serbian Ministry of Science and Technological Development (Law on Scientific Research, \"Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia\" No. 110/2005, 50/2006 - corr. and 18/2010)<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dimitrijevi\u0107 |first1=Du\u0161ko |title=\"Institute of International Politics and Economics (IIPE)\" |journal=Journal on European perspectives at the Western Balkans |volume=VII |issue=1(12) |pages=5\u201323 |url=https://www.cep.si/research/european-perspectives-journal/ |issn=1855-7694}}</ref>\n\nDuring its existence, the Institute of International Politics and Economics has proven to be a scientific research institution of special social and national interest. Associates of the Institute were engaged in the study of important issues in the field of foreign policy, international economy and international law. For many years, the Institute of International Politics and Economics has been the center of the study of international relations.\n\nIn 2017, the IIPE received the Sretenje Order of the President of the Republic of Serbia for a special contribution to the study of international relations, marking the 70th anniversary of the Institute.<ref name=\"PresidentNikoli\u0107\">{{cite journal | language = |title = \u0423\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0438 \u043e \u043e\u0434\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430\u045a\u0438\u043c\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u0458\u0435 \u0458\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438\u043a \u0420\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0435 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0458\u0435 \u0422\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432 \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0438\u045b | author =  | pages = | publisher  = [[President of Serbia|People\u00b4s Office of the President]] | journal =  | volume = | number = |date= | location = [[Belgrade]] | url = https://www.predsednik.rs/predsednik/ukazi-o-odlikovanjima | accessdate = 15 September 2018 }}</ref>\n\n==List of Directors==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! {{Abbr|No.|Number}}\n! colspan=2 | Director<ref name=\"Direktori\">{{cite journal | language =  |title = History and Mission | author =  | pages = | publisher  = Institute of International Politics and Economics | journal = | volume = | number = |date= | location = [[Belgrade]] | url = https://www.diplomacy.bg.ac.rs/index_en.php | accessdate = 15 September 2018 }}</ref>\n! colspan=2 | Term of office<ref name=\"Direktori\"/>\n!

Significant reductions in passenger numbers has resulted in planes flying empty between airports and the cancellation of flights.\n\n== Flight cancellations ==\nGovernment regulations in Europe and the United States mandate airlines to refund fares when flights are cancelled, but in many cases airlines have instead offered vouchers or travel credits that must be used by the end of the year.

Despite pleas from industry lobbyists to expand the regulations to allow travel credits, the US [[Department of Transportation]] has reiterated that airlines are obligated to provide refunds for cancelled flights.
