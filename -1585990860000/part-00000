{"title_page": "Perfect (grammar)", "text_new": "Michael Lehman {{Distinguish|Perfective aspect}}\nThe '''perfect''' tense or aspect ([[list of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] '''{{sc|perf}}''' or '''{{sc|prf}}''') is a [[verb]] form that indicates that an action or circumstance occurred earlier than the time under consideration, often focusing attention on the resulting state rather than on the occurrence itself. An example of a perfect construction is ''I have made dinner'': although this gives information about a prior action (my making of the dinner), the focus is likely to be on the present consequences of that action (the fact that the dinner is now ready). The word ''perfect'' in this sense means \"completed\" (from Latin ''perfectum'', which is the perfect passive [[participle]] of the verb ''perficere'' \"to complete\").\n\nIn traditional [[Latin verbs|Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek verbs|Ancient Greek]] grammar, the perfect [[grammatical tense|tense]] is a particular, [[grammatical conjugation|conjugated]]-verb form. Modern analyses view the perfect constructions of these languages as combining elements of grammatical tense (such as time reference) and [[grammatical aspect]]. The Greek perfect tense is contrasted with the [[aorist]] and the [[imperfect]] tenses and specifically refers to completed events with present consequences; its meaning is thus similar to that of the English construction, \"have/has (done something)\". The Latin perfect tense is contrasted only with the imperfect tense (used for past incomplete actions or states) and is thus used to mean both \"have/has done something\" and \"did something\" (the [[preterite]] use). Other related forms are the [[pluperfect]], denoting an event prior to a past time of reference, and the [[future perfect]], for an event prior to a future time of reference.\n\nIn the grammar of some modern languages, particularly of [[English grammar|English]], the ''perfect'' may be analyzed as an aspect that is independent of tense \u2013 the form that is traditionally just called the perfect (\"I have done\") is then called the [[present perfect]], while the form traditionally called the pluperfect (\"I had done\") is called the past perfect. (There are also additional forms such as future perfect, [[conditional perfect]], and so on.) The formation of the perfect in English, using forms of an [[auxiliary verb]] (''have'') together with the [[past participle]] of the main verb, is paralleled in a number of other modern European languages.\n\nThe perfect can be denoted by the [[list of glossing abbreviations|glossing abbreviation]] {{sc|'''perf'''}} or {{sc|'''prf'''}}. It should not be confused with the [[perfective]] aspect, which refers to the viewing of an action as a single (but not necessarily prior) event. To avoid confusion with the perfective, the perfect is occasionally called the '''retrospective''' ({{sc|'''ret'''}}).\n\n==As an aspect==\nIn some analyses, the ''perfect'' is identified as one of the [[grammatical aspect]]s. In the perfect aspect, the event being referred to is viewed as already completed at the time of reference.<ref>Dahl, Osten, ''Tense and Aspect Systems'', Blackwell Publ., 1985, chapter 5.</ref> It should not be confused with the [[perfective aspect]],<ref name=\"aspects\">{{cite book |last= Payne |first= Thomas Edward |title= Describing morphosyntax: a guide for field linguists |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year= 1997 |pages= 240 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=LC3DfjWfCiwC&pg=PA239&lpg=PA239&dq=%22perfect+aspect%22+%22perfective+aspect%22#PPA240,M1 |isbn= 9780521588058 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last= Trask |first= Robert Lawrence |title= A Dictionary of Grammatical Terms in Linguistics|publisher= Routledge |year= 1993 |pages= 204 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=erHbSh1xGvgC&pg=PA204&lpg=PA204&dq=%22perfect+aspect%22+%22perfective+aspect%22 |isbn= 9780415086288 }}</ref> which marks a situation as a single event ''without internal structure'', and does not imply prior occurrence or present relevance as the perfect aspect does. The perfect also contrasts with the [[prospective aspect]], which encodes the present relevance or anticipation of a future event. While the perfect is a relatively uniform category cross-linguistically, its relation to the experiential and [[resultative]] aspects is complex \u2013 the latter two are not simply restricted cases of the perfect.<ref name=Dahl>Dahl, 1985, p. 190.</ref>\n\nThe perfect is not necessarily incompatible with other grammatical aspects. In English, for example, it can be combined with the [[progressive aspect|progressive]] (continuous) aspect, wherein an event is viewed as temporary and ongoing. A form such as the [[present perfect progressive]] ''I have been working'' combines the meanings expressed by the two aspects \u2013 viewing my working as an ongoing process, but one which is now completed (or, as in ''I have been working for two hours'', restricting attention to the completed portion of that process).\n\nIf perfect is viewed as an aspect, then the verb forms traditionally called just \"perfect\" (as in Greek or \u2013 in appropriate contexts \u2013 in Latin) in fact combine the perfect aspect with present tense (the event occurred prior to the time of speech). The pluperfect and future perfect forms combine perfect aspect with past and future tense respectively. This analysis is reflected more explicitly in the terminology commonly used in modern English grammars, which refer to [[present perfect]], [[past perfect]] and [[future perfect]] (as well as some other constructions such as [[conditional perfect]]).\n\nHowever, not all uses of \"perfect\" verb forms necessarily express this \"perfect aspect\" \u2013 sometimes they are simply used as expressions of [[past tense]], that is, as [[preterite]]s. This applies to some uses of the Latin perfect, and also (for example) to the modern German ''Perfekt''.\n\n==Types==\nIn English, several uses of the perfect aspect have been recognized:<ref>Michaelis, Laura (1994)[https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-linguistics/article/ambiguity-of-the-english-present-perfect1/C6D9E5B8AA0C756B409F2E638DF5A674\"The Ambiguity of the English Present Perfect\"]. <i>Journal of Linguistics</i> 30: 1</ref><ref>Mittwoch, Anna (2008) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40270139 \"The English Resultative Perfect and Its Relationship to the Experiential Perfect and the Simple Past Tense\"].

Longmans Green, p.\u00a037.</ref> This can be considered to be the same as resultative perfect. \n* '''Perfect of very recent past''':\n:: (Alicante Spanish) {{lang|es|Yo estaba andando en el bosque. De pronto he pisado una culebra. Me ha mordido en la pierna.}} '(An hour ago) I was walking in the forest. Suddenly I stepped on a snake. It bit me in the leg.' (lit.

''Tense and Aspect in the Languages of Europe''. Mouton de Gruyter, Berlin and New York, p.\u00a0267.</ref> \n* '''Evidential''' or '''inferential perfect''' (a statement that something must have happened because of the evidence available):\n:: (Swedish) {{lang|sv|Tjuven har kommit in genom det h\u00e4r f\u00f6nstret}} 'The thief evidently got in through this window' (literally, 'has got in')<ref>Lindstedt, Jouko, \"The perfect - aspectual, temporal and evidential\", p.\u00a0376.</ref>\n* '''Reportative perfect''' (referring to an event which the speaker has heard about but not personally witnessed). This is common in languages such as Turkish, Persian, Georgian, and Bulgarian:<ref>Comrie, ''Aspect'', p.\u00a0108ff.</ref>\n:: (Turkish) {{lang|tr|Hasta-y-m\u0131\u015f-\u0131m}} 'They say I was/am ill' (literally, 'I have been ill')<ref>Sezer, Engin \"Finite Inflection in Turkish\", p.\u00a017. In Taylan, Eser Erguvanl\u0131 (ed.) (2002), ''The Verb in Turkish'', John Benjamins, Amsterdam.</ref>\n\n==Discontinuous past==\nIn some languages a type of tense has been noted with exactly the opposite implication to a perfect. This type of tense is known as [[discontinuous past]].<ref>[[Vladimir Plungian|Plungian, Vladimir A.]] & Johan van der Auwera (2006). [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272264027_Towards_a_typology_of_discontinuous_past_marking \"Towards a typology of discontinuous past marking.\"] Sprachtypol. Univ. Forsch. (STUF), Berlin 59, 4, 317\u2013349.</ref> Thus if a sentence such as \"I have put the book on the table\" implies that it is still on the table, so a discontinuous past sentence \"I put the book on the table\" in these languages would imply that the book is no longer on the table.\n\n==Construction with auxiliaries==\nA number of modern European languages exhibit a parallel type of perfect (or perfect-like) construction, formed with an [[auxiliary verb]] in combination with the [[past participle]] of the main verb. The auxiliary may be a verb meaning ''have'' (as in the English ''I have won'') or a verb meaning ''be'' (as in the French {{lang|fr|je suis arriv\u00e9(e)}}, \"I (have) arrived\", literally \"I am arrived\").\n\nThe ''have''-perfect developed from a construction where the verb meaning ''have'' denoted [[possession (linguistics)|possession]], and the past participle was an [[adjective]] modifying the [[object (grammar)|object]], as in ''I have the work done''.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} This came to be reanalyzed, with the object becoming the object of the main verb, and the participle becoming a dependent of the ''have'' verb, as in ''I have done the work.'' The construction could then be generalized to be used also with [[intransitive verb]]s. A vestige of the original interpretation is preserved in some languages in the form of [[inflection]] on the participle to agree with the gender and number of the object.\n\nThe ''be''-perfect developed similarly, from a construction where the verb meaning ''be'' was an ordinary [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] and the participle expressed a [[resultative]] state of the [[subject (grammar)|subject]].<ref>Joan Bybee, Revere Perkins, William Pagliuca, ''The Evolution of Grammar: Tense, Aspect, and Modality in the Languages of the World'', University of Chicago Press, 1994.</ref> It is consequently used mostly with verbs that denote a change in the state or location of the subject, and in some languages the participle inflects to agree with the gender and number of the subject.\n\nLanguages that use these constructions can generally inflect the auxiliary to produce different verb forms for the perfect aspect: the [[pluperfect]] or past perfect is produced with the auxiliary in the past tense, the [[future perfect]] with the auxiliary in the future tense, and so on. These include [[non-finite verb|non-finite]] forms such as [[perfect infinitive]]s. (More possible forms and examples are given under {{slink||English}} below.)\n\nThe basic (present) perfect form, with the auxiliary in the present tense, may specifically carry the meaning of perfect aspect, as in English; however in some languages it is used more generally as a past tense (or [[preterite]]), as in French and German.\n\nThe use of auxiliaries and meaning of the constructions in various languages are described below.\n* English uses ''have'' as the auxiliary; the use of ''be'' with some intransitive verbs (as in ''I am come''; ''he is gone'') is archaic. For more details see the section on {{slink||English}} below.\n* [[German language|German]] uses {{lang|de|haben}} (\"have\") as the auxiliary with most verbs, and {{lang|de|sein}} (\"be\") with some intransitives, including the copula {{lang|de|sein}} itself. The German \"present perfect\" construction is called the {{lang|de|Perfekt}} (perfect), and for most verbs is the usual past tense for colloquial speech and dialects. For details, see [[German verbs]]. Other [[Germanic languages]] have similar constructions, such as the {{lang|sv|perfekt}} of [[Swedish grammar|Swedish]] and the {{lang|nl|perfectum}} (compound past) of [[Dutch verbs|Dutch]].\n* [[French verbs|French]] uses {{lang|fr|avoir}} (\"have\") as the auxiliary with most verbs, but uses {{lang|fr|\u00eatre}} (\"be\") with [[reflexive verb]]s and with a certain number of intransitive verbs. The past participle is inflected to agree in [[grammatical gender|gender]] and [[grammatical number|number]] with the subject when {{lang|fr|\u00eatre}} is used, and with a direct object when {{lang|fr|avoir}} is used, but then only when the object precedes the verb (which is normally the case with [[personal pronoun]]s and in some [[relative clause|relative]] and [[interrogative clause]]s). The construction with \"present perfect\" form is called the {{lang|fr|pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9}} (compound past) and is the usual past tense for completed events, corresponding to both the English present perfect and to the [[simple past]]. For more details see {{lang|fr|[[pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9]]}}.\n* [[Italian language|Italian]] uses {{lang|it|avere}} (\"have\") and {{lang|it|essere}} (\"be\") as auxiliaries, distributed in much the same way as {{lang|fr|avoir}} and {{lang|fr|\u00eatre}} in French. The participle agrees with the subject when {{lang|it|essere}} is used, and with a preceding pronoun direct object when {{lang|it|avere}} is used. The present perfect is often used also for completed events where English would use the simple past. For details see [[Italian grammar]].\n* [[Spanish language|Spanish]] uses {{lang|es|haber}} (\"have\") as the auxiliary with all verbs. The \"present perfect\" form is called the {{lang|es|pret\u00e9rito perfecto}} and is used similarly to the English present perfect. See [[Spanish verbs]].\n\n[[Celtic languages]] (except [[Cornish language|Cornish]] and [[Breton language|Breton]]) have a somewhat different type of perfect construction, where a word meaning \"after\" is used together with a verbal noun. This is described under [[Welsh grammar]] and [[Irish conjugation]]. By analogy with this construction, sentences of the form ''I'm after eating'' (meaning \"I have eaten\") are used in [[Irish English]]. Middle Cornish and Middle Breton used a perfective particle ''re'' with the preterite to express a present perfect sense, although this has largely fallen out of use in the modern languages, being replaced with periphrastic formations using the verbs \"to be\" or \"to have\" with a past participle.\n\n==In particular languages==\n\n===Proto-Indo-European===\nIn reconstructions of the [[Proto-Indo-European language]] (PIE), the verb form that has traditionally been called \"perfect\" in fact signified [[stative]] aspect (a current state of being). The name was assigned based on similarity to the Greek or Latin perfect tense, before the stative nature of the form was fully recognized. For details of its formation, see [[Proto-Indo-European verbs]].\n\n===Ancient Greek===\nThe [[Ancient Greek]] perfect developed from the PIE perfect (stative) form; in both cases the stem is typically formed by [[reduplication]]. In Greek, however, it took on a true \"perfect\" meaning, indicating an action with a permanent result.<ref>[[Herbert Weir Smyth]]. ''A Greek grammar for colleges''. page 413, paragraph 1852.b: stage of action: completed action with permanent result.</ref> The effect of the action is seen in the resulting state; this state may belong to either the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] or the [[object (grammar)|object]].<ref>Smyth. p. 434, par. 1945.a: effects of a completed action.</ref> The meaning is therefore similar to the English present perfect, although usage of the Greek perfect is rather narrower than in English. Greek also has a [[pluperfect]] and a (compound) [[future perfect]], although their use is rare.\n\nOther verb forms used in Ancient Greek to refer to past circumstances were the [[aorist (Ancient Greek)|aorist]], which was used simply to report past events (for example in narrative), and the [[imperfect]].\n\nFor details of the formation and use of the Greek perfect, see [[Ancient Greek verbs]] (see also {{slink|Ancient Greek grammar|Dependence of moods and tenses}}). For the (compound) perfect found in modern Greek, see [[Modern Greek verbs]].\n\n===Latin===\nIn [[Latin grammar|Latin]] the PIE aorist merged with the perfect.<ref>L. R. Palmer, ''The Latin Language'', University of Oklahoma Press, 1988, p. 8.</ref> Consequently the Latin perfect tense serves both as a true perfect (meaning, for example, ''I have done''), and as a simple [[preterite]], merely reporting a past event (''I did''). It contrasts with the [[imperfect]], which denotes uncompleted past actions or states.\n\nLatin also has pluperfect and future perfect forms. For details of how all of these forms are made, see [[Latin conjugation]].\n\n===English===\nThe [[English verbs|English]] perfect is made with a form of the [[English auxiliaries|auxiliary verb]] ''have'' together with the past [[participle]] of the main verb. The auxiliary is inflected for [[grammatical tense|tense]] and [[grammatical mood|mood]], and can also appear in [[non-finite verb|non-finite forms]] (infinitive, participle or gerund), thus giving rise to a number of constructions which combine the perfect [[grammatical aspect|aspect]] with other verbal properties:\n*''I have eaten''; ''he has eaten'' ([[present perfect]], generally denoting something that took place prior to the present moment)\n*''I had eaten'' ([[past perfect]], something that took place prior to a moment in the past)\n*''I will have eaten'' ([[future perfect]], something to take place prior to a moment in the future)\n*''I would have eaten'' ([[conditional perfect]], something conceived as taking place in hypothetical past circumstances)\n*''...that he have eaten...'' (present perfect subjunctive, a rarely used form; see [[English subjunctive]])\n*''(to) have eaten'' (perfect infinitive)\n*''having eaten'' (perfect gerund or participle)\n\nThe perfect can also be combined with another aspect<ref>The perfect, the progressive, and the perfect progressive are three of the aspect-like forms used in English.  The perfective, imperfective, completive, inceptive, punctual, iterative, and habitual are sometimes considered aspects in English as well. {{cite book |last= Thomas |first= Payne Edward |title= Describing morphosyntax: a guide for field linguists |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year= 1997 |pages= 238\u2013241 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=LC3DfjWfCiwC&pg=PA239&lpg=PA239&dq=%22perfect+aspect%22+%22perfective+aspect%22#PPA238,M1 |isbn= 9780521588058 }}</ref> that is marked in English \u2013 the [[continuous and progressive aspects|progressive]] (or continuous) aspect. In [[perfect progressive]] (or perfect continuous) constructions, the perfect auxiliary (a form of ''have'') is followed by the past participle ''been'' (from ''be'', the auxiliary of the progressive aspect), which in turn is followed by the present participle of the main verb. As before, the perfect auxiliary can appear in various tenses, moods and non-finite forms:\n*''I have been eating''; ''he has been eating'' ([[present perfect progressive]])\n*''I had been eating'' ([[past perfect progressive]])\n* etc.\n\nThe perfect aspect (or perfect progressive) can also be combined with marking for the [[English passive voice|passive voice]]. Perfect passive forms can be constructed by replacing the participle of the main verb with the corresponding participle of ''be'' followed by the past participle of the main verb: ''it has been eaten''; ''it will have been eaten''; ''it has been being eaten''. Perfect progressive passives, as in the last example, therefore involve two consecutive participles of the auxiliary verb ''be''; these constructions are rarely used.\n\nThe implications of the present perfect (that something occurred prior to the present moment) are similar to those of the [[simple past]]. The simple past is generally used when the occurrence has a specific past time frame \u2013 either explicitly stated (''I wrote a book '''in 1995'''''; ''the water boiled '''a minute ago'''''), or implied by the context (for example, in the narration of a sequence of events). The present perfect, on the other hand, is used when the assumed time frame lasts up until the present moment: ''I have written two novels'' (in my lifetime; I am still alive); ''You have done no work this morning'' (it is still the morning). It is often used to draw attention to the consequences rather than the action: ''I've built a tree-house'' (the time of building is not important; the focus is on the result, the present existence of the tree-house).<ref name=\"present\">[http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/tenses/present_perfect.htm Present Perfect. Guide to Grammar and Writing.]</ref>\n\nPerfect progressive forms are used mainly to refer to an action continuing up to (or nearly up to) the time of reference, again with emphasis on its consequences (''we were tired because we '''had been running'''''), or its duration (''we '''have been working''' for ten hours/since 7 o'clock''). They may express interrupted activities (''I '''had been writing''' a novel when she came to talk to me'').<ref>[http://www.eng.fju.edu.tw/iacd_99S/grammar_composition/Tenses/new_page_7.html Past Perfect Progressive Tense.]</ref>\n\nThe perfect infinitive (without ''to'' in most cases) can be used after [[English modal verbs|modal verbs]] with various meanings, chiefly to express [[modality (linguistics)|modality]] with regard to past events: ''you should have done that''; ''she might have seen it''. With ''would'' (and sometimes ''should'' and ''could'') it forms a contrary-to-fact past conditional ([[conditional perfect]]),<ref>[http://staff.gps.edu/northcutt/vadens%20per%20romam/Adnotes/Adnotes58.htm Conditional Sentences.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719203101/http://staff.gps.edu/northcutt/vadens%20per%20romam/Adnotes/Adnotes58.htm |date=2011-07-19 }}</ref> as in ''she would/could have done it if she had tried''.<ref>[http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/GRAMMAR/conditional.htm Conditional Verb Forms.

An example of a perfect construction is ''I have made dinner'': although this gives information about a prior action (my making of the dinner), the focus is likely to be on the present consequences of that action (the fact that the dinner is now ready). The word ''perfect'' in this sense means \"completed\" (from Latin ''perfectum'', which is the perfect passive [[participle]] of the verb ''perficere'' \"to complete\").\n\nIn traditional [[Latin verbs|Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek verbs|Ancient Greek]] grammar, the perfect [[grammatical tense|tense]] is a particular, [[grammatical conjugation|conjugated]]-verb form. Modern analyses view the perfect constructions of these languages as combining elements of grammatical tense (such as time reference) and [[grammatical aspect]]. The Greek perfect tense is contrasted with the [[aorist]] and the [[imperfect]] tenses and specifically refers to completed events with present consequences; its meaning is thus similar to that of the English construction, \"have/has (done something)\". The Latin perfect tense is contrasted only with the imperfect tense (used for past incomplete actions or states) and is thus used to mean both \"have/has done something\" and \"did something\" (the [[preterite]] use). Other related forms are the [[pluperfect]], denoting an event prior to a past time of reference, and the [[future perfect]], for an event prior to a future time of reference.\n\nIn the grammar of some modern languages, particularly of [[English grammar|English]], the ''perfect'' may be analyzed as an aspect that is independent of tense \u2013 the form that is traditionally just called the perfect (\"I have done\") is then called the [[present perfect]], while the form traditionally called the pluperfect (\"I had done\") is called the past perfect. (There are also additional forms such as future perfect, [[conditional perfect]], and so on.) The formation of the perfect in English, using forms of an [[auxiliary verb]] (''have'') together with the [[past participle]] of the main verb, is paralleled in a number of other modern European languages.\n\nThe perfect can be denoted by the [[list of glossing abbreviations|glossing abbreviation]] {{sc|'''perf'''}} or {{sc|'''prf'''}}. It should not be confused with the [[perfective]] aspect, which refers to the viewing of an action as a single (but not necessarily prior) event. To avoid confusion with the perfective, the perfect is occasionally called the '''retrospective''' ({{sc|'''ret'''}}).\n\n==As an aspect==\nIn some analyses, the ''perfect'' is identified as one of the [[grammatical aspect]]s. In the perfect aspect, the event being referred to is viewed as already completed at the time of reference.<ref>Dahl, Osten, ''Tense and Aspect Systems'', Blackwell Publ., 1985, chapter 5.</ref> It should not be confused with the [[perfective aspect]],<ref name=\"aspects\">{{cite book |last= Payne |first= Thomas Edward |title= Describing morphosyntax: a guide for field linguists |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year= 1997 |pages= 240 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=LC3DfjWfCiwC&pg=PA239&lpg=PA239&dq=%22perfect+aspect%22+%22perfective+aspect%22#PPA240,M1 |isbn= 9780521588058 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last= Trask |first= Robert Lawrence |title= A Dictionary of Grammatical Terms in Linguistics|publisher= Routledge |year= 1993 |pages= 204 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=erHbSh1xGvgC&pg=PA204&lpg=PA204&dq=%22perfect+aspect%22+%22perfective+aspect%22 |isbn= 9780415086288 }}</ref> which marks a situation as a single event ''without internal structure'', and does not imply prior occurrence or present relevance as the perfect aspect does. The perfect also contrasts with the [[prospective aspect]], which encodes the present relevance or anticipation of a future event. While the perfect is a relatively uniform category cross-linguistically, its relation to the experiential and [[resultative]] aspects is complex \u2013 the latter two are not simply restricted cases of the perfect.<ref name=Dahl>Dahl, 1985, p. 190.</ref>\n\nThe perfect is not necessarily incompatible with other grammatical aspects. In English, for example, it can be combined with the [[progressive aspect|progressive]] (continuous) aspect, wherein an event is viewed as temporary and ongoing. A form such as the [[present perfect progressive]] ''I have been working'' combines the meanings expressed by the two aspects \u2013 viewing my working as an ongoing process, but one which is now completed (or, as in ''I have been working for two hours'', restricting attention to the completed portion of that process).\n\nIf perfect is viewed as an aspect, then the verb forms traditionally called just \"perfect\" (as in Greek or \u2013 in appropriate contexts \u2013 in Latin) in fact combine the perfect aspect with present tense (the event occurred prior to the time of speech). The pluperfect and future perfect forms combine perfect aspect with past and future tense respectively. This analysis is reflected more explicitly in the terminology commonly used in modern English grammars, which refer to [[present perfect]], [[past perfect]] and [[future perfect]] (as well as some other constructions such as [[conditional perfect]]).\n\nHowever, not all uses of \"perfect\" verb forms necessarily express this \"perfect aspect\" \u2013 sometimes they are simply used as expressions of [[past tense]], that is, as [[preterite]]s. This applies to some uses of the Latin perfect, and also (for example) to the modern German ''Perfekt''.\n\n==Types==\nIn English, several uses of the perfect aspect have been recognized:<ref>Michaelis, Laura (1994)[https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-linguistics/article/ambiguity-of-the-english-present-perfect1/C6D9E5B8AA0C756B409F2E638DF5A674\"The Ambiguity of the English Present Perfect\"]. <i>Journal of Linguistics</i> 30: 1</ref><ref>Mittwoch, Anna (2008) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40270139 \"The English Resultative Perfect and Its Relationship to the Experiential Perfect and the Simple Past Tense\"].

Longmans Green, p.\u00a037.</ref> This can be considered to be the same as resultative perfect. \n* '''Perfect of very recent past''':\n:: (Alicante Spanish) {{lang|es|Yo estaba andando en el bosque.

In Taylan, Eser Erguvanl\u0131 (ed.) (2002), ''The Verb in Turkish'', John Benjamins, Amsterdam.</ref>\n\n==Discontinuous past==\nIn some languages a type of tense has been noted with exactly the opposite implication to a perfect. This type of tense is known as [[discontinuous past]].<ref>[[Vladimir Plungian|Plungian, Vladimir A.]] & Johan van der Auwera (2006). [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272264027_Towards_a_typology_of_discontinuous_past_marking \"Towards a typology of discontinuous past marking.\"] Sprachtypol. Univ. Forsch. (STUF), Berlin 59, 4, 317\u2013349.</ref> Thus if a sentence such as \"I have put the book on the table\" implies that it is still on the table, so a discontinuous past sentence \"I put the book on the table\" in these languages would imply that the book is no longer on the table.\n\n==Construction with auxiliaries==\nA number of modern European languages exhibit a parallel type of perfect (or perfect-like) construction, formed with an [[auxiliary verb]] in combination with the [[past participle]] of the main verb. The auxiliary may be a verb meaning ''have'' (as in the English ''I have won'') or a verb meaning ''be'' (as in the French {{lang|fr|je suis arriv\u00e9(e)}}, \"I (have) arrived\", literally \"I am arrived\").\n\nThe ''have''-perfect developed from a construction where the verb meaning ''have'' denoted [[possession (linguistics)|possession]], and the past participle was an [[adjective]] modifying the [[object (grammar)|object]], as in ''I have the work done''.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} This came to be reanalyzed, with the object becoming the object of the main verb, and the participle becoming a dependent of the ''have'' verb, as in ''I have done the work.'' The construction could then be generalized to be used also with [[intransitive verb]]s. A vestige of the original interpretation is preserved in some languages in the form of [[inflection]] on the participle to agree with the gender and number of the object.\n\nThe ''be''-perfect developed similarly, from a construction where the verb meaning ''be'' was an ordinary [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] and the participle expressed a [[resultative]] state of the [[subject (grammar)|subject]].<ref>Joan Bybee, Revere Perkins, William Pagliuca, ''The Evolution of Grammar: Tense, Aspect, and Modality in the Languages of the World'', University of Chicago Press, 1994.</ref> It is consequently used mostly with verbs that denote a change in the state or location of the subject, and in some languages the participle inflects to agree with the gender and number of the subject.\n\nLanguages that use these constructions can generally inflect the auxiliary to produce different verb forms for the perfect aspect: the [[pluperfect]] or past perfect is produced with the auxiliary in the past tense, the [[future perfect]] with the auxiliary in the future tense, and so on. These include [[non-finite verb|non-finite]] forms such as [[perfect infinitive]]s. (More possible forms and examples are given under {{slink||English}} below.)\n\nThe basic (present) perfect form, with the auxiliary in the present tense, may specifically carry the meaning of perfect aspect, as in English; however in some languages it is used more generally as a past tense (or [[preterite]]), as in French and German.\n\nThe use of auxiliaries and meaning of the constructions in various languages are described below.\n* English uses ''have'' as the auxiliary; the use of ''be'' with some intransitive verbs (as in ''I am come''; ''he is gone'') is archaic. For more details see the section on {{slink||English}} below.\n* [[German language|German]] uses {{lang|de|haben}} (\"have\") as the auxiliary with most verbs, and {{lang|de|sein}} (\"be\") with some intransitives, including the copula {{lang|de|sein}} itself. The German \"present perfect\" construction is called the {{lang|de|Perfekt}} (perfect), and for most verbs is the usual past tense for colloquial speech and dialects. For details, see [[German verbs]]. Other [[Germanic languages]] have similar constructions, such as the {{lang|sv|perfekt}} of [[Swedish grammar|Swedish]] and the {{lang|nl|perfectum}} (compound past) of [[Dutch verbs|Dutch]].\n* [[French verbs|French]] uses {{lang|fr|avoir}} (\"have\") as the auxiliary with most verbs, but uses {{lang|fr|\u00eatre}} (\"be\") with [[reflexive verb]]s and with a certain number of intransitive verbs. The past participle is inflected to agree in [[grammatical gender|gender]] and [[grammatical number|number]] with the subject when {{lang|fr|\u00eatre}} is used, and with a direct object when {{lang|fr|avoir}} is used, but then only when the object precedes the verb (which is normally the case with [[personal pronoun]]s and in some [[relative clause|relative]] and [[interrogative clause]]s). The construction with \"present perfect\" form is called the {{lang|fr|pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9}} (compound past) and is the usual past tense for completed events, corresponding to both the English present perfect and to the [[simple past]]. For more details see {{lang|fr|[[pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9]]}}.\n* [[Italian language|Italian]] uses {{lang|it|avere}} (\"have\") and {{lang|it|essere}} (\"be\") as auxiliaries, distributed in much the same way as {{lang|fr|avoir}} and {{lang|fr|\u00eatre}} in French. The participle agrees with the subject when {{lang|it|essere}} is used, and with a preceding pronoun direct object when {{lang|it|avere}} is used. The present perfect is often used also for completed events where English would use the simple past. For details see [[Italian grammar]].\n* [[Spanish language|Spanish]] uses {{lang|es|haber}} (\"have\") as the auxiliary with all verbs. The \"present perfect\" form is called the {{lang|es|pret\u00e9rito perfecto}} and is used similarly to the English present perfect. See [[Spanish verbs]].\n\n[[Celtic languages]] (except [[Cornish language|Cornish]] and [[Breton language|Breton]]) have a somewhat different type of perfect construction, where a word meaning \"after\" is used together with a verbal noun. This is described under [[Welsh grammar]] and [[Irish conjugation]]. By analogy with this construction, sentences of the form ''I'm after eating'' (meaning \"I have eaten\") are used in [[Irish English]]. Middle Cornish and Middle Breton used a perfective particle ''re'' with the preterite to express a present perfect sense, although this has largely fallen out of use in the modern languages, being replaced with periphrastic formations using the verbs \"to be\" or \"to have\" with a past participle.\n\n==In particular languages==\n\n===Proto-Indo-European===\nIn reconstructions of the [[Proto-Indo-European language]] (PIE), the verb form that has traditionally been called \"perfect\" in fact signified [[stative]] aspect (a current state of being). The name was assigned based on similarity to the Greek or Latin perfect tense, before the stative nature of the form was fully recognized. For details of its formation, see [[Proto-Indo-European verbs]].\n\n===Ancient Greek===\nThe [[Ancient Greek]] perfect developed from the PIE perfect (stative) form; in both cases the stem is typically formed by [[reduplication]]. In Greek, however, it took on a true \"perfect\" meaning, indicating an action with a permanent result.<ref>[[Herbert Weir Smyth]]. ''A Greek grammar for colleges''. page 413, paragraph 1852.b: stage of action: completed action with permanent result.</ref> The effect of the action is seen in the resulting state; this state may belong to either the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] or the [[object (grammar)|object]].<ref>Smyth. p. 434, par. 1945.a: effects of a completed action.</ref> The meaning is therefore similar to the English present perfect, although usage of the Greek perfect is rather narrower than in English. Greek also has a [[pluperfect]] and a (compound) [[future perfect]], although their use is rare.\n\nOther verb forms used in Ancient Greek to refer to past circumstances were the [[aorist (Ancient Greek)|aorist]], which was used simply to report past events (for example in narrative), and the [[imperfect]].\n\nFor details of the formation and use of the Greek perfect, see [[Ancient Greek verbs]] (see also {{slink|Ancient Greek grammar|Dependence of moods and tenses}}). For the (compound) perfect found in modern Greek, see [[Modern Greek verbs]].\n\n===Latin===\nIn [[Latin grammar|Latin]] the PIE aorist merged with the perfect.<ref>L. R. Palmer, ''The Latin Language'', University of Oklahoma Press, 1988, p. 8.</ref> Consequently the Latin perfect tense serves both as a true perfect (meaning, for example, ''I have done''), and as a simple [[preterite]], merely reporting a past event (''I did''). It contrasts with the [[imperfect]], which denotes uncompleted past actions or states.\n\nLatin also has pluperfect and future perfect forms. For details of how all of these forms are made, see [[Latin conjugation]].\n\n===English===\nThe [[English verbs|English]] perfect is made with a form of the [[English auxiliaries|auxiliary verb]] ''have'' together with the past [[participle]] of the main verb. The auxiliary is inflected for [[grammatical tense|tense]] and [[grammatical mood|mood]], and can also appear in [[non-finite verb|non-finite forms]] (infinitive, participle or gerund), thus giving rise to a number of constructions which combine the perfect [[grammatical aspect|aspect]] with other verbal properties:\n*''I have eaten''; ''he has eaten'' ([[present perfect]], generally denoting something that took place prior to the present moment)\n*''I had eaten'' ([[past perfect]], something that took place prior to a moment in the past)\n*''I will have eaten'' ([[future perfect]], something to take place prior to a moment in the future)\n*''I would have eaten'' ([[conditional perfect]], something conceived as taking place in hypothetical past circumstances)\n*''...that he have eaten...'' (present perfect subjunctive, a rarely used form; see [[English subjunctive]])\n*''(to) have eaten'' (perfect infinitive)\n*''having eaten'' (perfect gerund or participle)\n\nThe perfect can also be combined with another aspect<ref>The perfect, the progressive, and the perfect progressive are three of the aspect-like forms used in English.  The perfective, imperfective, completive, inceptive, punctual, iterative, and habitual are sometimes considered aspects in English as well. {{cite book |last= Thomas |first= Payne Edward |title= Describing morphosyntax: a guide for field linguists |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year= 1997 |pages= 238\u2013241 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=LC3DfjWfCiwC&pg=PA239&lpg=PA239&dq=%22perfect+aspect%22+%22perfective+aspect%22#PPA238,M1 |isbn= 9780521588058 }}</ref> that is marked in English \u2013 the [[continuous and progressive aspects|progressive]] (or continuous) aspect. In [[perfect progressive]] (or perfect continuous) constructions, the perfect auxiliary (a form of ''have'') is followed by the past participle ''been'' (from ''be'', the auxiliary of the progressive aspect), which in turn is followed by the present participle of the main verb. As before, the perfect auxiliary can appear in various tenses, moods and non-finite forms:\n*''I have been eating''; ''he has been eating'' ([[present perfect progressive]])\n*''I had been eating'' ([[past perfect progressive]])\n* etc.\n\nThe perfect aspect (or perfect progressive) can also be combined with marking for the [[English passive voice|passive voice]]. Perfect passive forms can be constructed by replacing the participle of the main verb with the corresponding participle of ''be'' followed by the past participle of the main verb: ''it has been eaten''; ''it will have been eaten''; ''it has been being eaten''. Perfect progressive passives, as in the last example, therefore involve two consecutive participles of the auxiliary verb ''be''; these constructions are rarely used.\n\nThe implications of the present perfect (that something occurred prior to the present moment) are similar to those of the [[simple past]]. The simple past is generally used when the occurrence has a specific past time frame \u2013 either explicitly stated (''I wrote a book '''in 1995'''''; ''the water boiled '''a minute ago'''''), or implied by the context (for example, in the narration of a sequence of events). The present perfect, on the other hand, is used when the assumed time frame lasts up until the present moment: ''I have written two novels'' (in my lifetime; I am still alive); ''You have done no work this morning'' (it is still the morning).

Threadripper uses the larger [[Socket TR4|TR4]] and [[Socket sTRX4|sTRX4]] sockets, which support more memory channels and [[PCI Express]] lanes.<ref name=\"tr_threadripper\"/><ref name=\"ars_threadripper\"/>\n\nIn December 2019, AMD started putting out first generation Ryzen products built using the second generation Zen+ architecture.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wccftech.com/first-gen-amd-ryzen-cpus-are-appearing-with-12nm-zen-architecture/|title=First-Gen AMD Ryzen CPUs are Appearing with 12nm Zen+ Architecture|date=2019-12-22}}</ref> The most notable example is Ryzen 5 1600, with newest batches, having \"AF\" identifier instead of its usual \"AE\", being essentially a rebadged Ryzen 5 2600 with the same specifications as the original Ryzen 5 1600.\n\n==History==\nIn the five years before the release of Ryzen, AMD's direct competitor in the [[x86-64|x86 and x86-64]] consumer-level CPU marketspace, [[Intel]], had continued to grow its market share with the [[Tick-tock model|tick-tock]] improvement cycle of its [[Intel Core| Core]] series of microprocessors.<ref name=\"cpubenchmark_marketshare\"/> Since the release of its [[Bulldozer (microarchitecture)|Bulldozer microarchitecture]] in 2011, AMD's CPUs had fallen progressively behind those from Intel in both single- and multi-core performance.<ref name=\"ars-zendetails\"/> Despite a die shrink and several revisions of the Bulldozer architecture, performance and power efficiency failed to catch up with Intel's competing products.{{cn|date=August 2017}}\n\nRyzen is the consumer-level implementation of the newer [[Zen (microarchitecture)|Zen microarchitecture]], a complete re-design that marked the return of AMD to the high-end CPU market, offering a product stack able to compete with Intel at every level.<ref name=\"ars-zenperformance\"/><ref name=\"toms-ryzen2faq\"/> Having more processing cores, Ryzen processors offer greater multi-threaded performance at the same price point relative to Intel's Core processors.<ref name=\"anand-ryzen1-deepdive-p23\"/> The Zen architecture delivers more than 52% improvement in [[Instructions per cycle|instructions-per-clock cycle]] over the previous-generation Bulldozer AMD core, without increasing power consumption.<ref name=\"amd.com-zencore\"/> \n\nThreadripper, which is geared for high end desktops (HEDT), wasn't developed as part of a business plan or a specific roadmap; instead a small enthusiast team inside AMD saw an opportunity that something could be developed between the Ryzen and Epyc cpu roadmaps that would put the crown of performance on AMD. After some progress was made in their spare time the project was green lit and put in an official roadmap by 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/antonyleather/2017/09/05/amd-ryzen-threadripper-the-fascinating-story-behind-the-processor-that-beat-intel/|title=AMD Ryzen Threadripper: The Fascinating Story Behind The Processor That Beat Intel|last=Leather|first=Antony|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2020-01-06}}</ref>\n\nSince the release of Ryzen, AMD's CPU market share has increased while Intel appears to have stagnated.<ref name=\"cpubenchmark_marketshare\" />\n\n== Features  ==\n===CPUs===\n[[Template:AMD x86 CPU features|CPU features table]]\n===APUs===\n[[Template:AMD APU features|APU features table]]\n\n== Product lineup ==\n=== Zen microarchitecture ===\n{{main|Zen (microarchitecture)}}\n==== CPUs: Summit Ridge (Ryzen) and Whitehaven (Ryzen Threadripper) ====\n* [[Socket AM4]] for Ryzen and [[Socket TR4]] for Ryzen Threadripper.<ref name=\"anand-ryzen1-deepdive\"/><ref name=\"techreport-ryzenreview\"/>\n* 4.8 billion [[transistor]]s per 192&nbsp;mm<sup>2</sup><ref name=\"sweclockers-ryzenreview\"/> 8-core \"Zeppelin\" [[Die (integrated circuit)|die]]<ref name=\"Anand_Ryzen_announcement\"/> with one die being used for Ryzen and two for Ryzen Threadripper.\n* [[Stepping (version numbers)|Stepping]]: B1<ref name=\"guru3d-1800x-review\"/>\n* Memory support:\n**Ryzen [[multi-channel memory architecture#Dual-channel architecture|dual-channel]]: [[DDR4 SDRAM|DDR4]]\u20132666 \u00d72 single rank, DDR4\u20132400 \u00d72 dual rank, DDR4\u20132133 \u00d74 single rank, or DDR4\u20131866 \u00d74 dual rank.<ref name=\"anand-ryzen1-deepdive\"/><ref name=\"amdblog-pcbuild\"/>\n**Ryzen Threadripper [[multi-channel memory architecture#Quad-channel architecture|quad-channel]]: DDR4\u20132666 \u00d74 single rank, DDR4\u20132400 \u00d74 dual rank, DDR4\u20132133 \u00d78 single rank, or DDR4\u20131866 \u00d78 dual rank.\n* Instructions Sets: ''[[x87]], [[MMX (instruction set)|MMX]], [[Streaming SIMD Extensions|SSE]], [[SSE2]], [[SSE3]], [[SSSE3]], [[SSE4.1]], [[SSE4.2]], [[AES instruction set|AES]], [[CLMUL instruction set|CLMUL]], [[Advanced Vector Extensions|AVX]], [[AVX2]], [[FMA3 instruction set|FMA3]], [[CVT16 instruction set|CVT16/F16C]], [[Bit Manipulation Instruction Sets#ABM|ABM]], [[Bit Manipulation Instruction Sets#BMI1|BMI1]], [[Bit Manipulation Instruction Sets#BMI2|BMI2]], [[Intel SHA extensions|SHA]]''.<ref name=\"sourceware-znver1\"/>\n* All Ryzen-branded CPUs (except Pro variants) feature unlocked multipliers.\n* AMD's SenseMI Technology monitors the processor continuously and uses Infinity Control Fabric to offer the following features:<ref name=\"anand-ryzen1-deepdive\"/><ref name=\"ars-1800x-review\"/><ref name=\"toms-1800x-review\"/>\n** Pure Power reduces the entire ramp of processor voltage and clock speed, for light loads.\n** Precision Boost increases the processor voltage and clock speed by 100\u2013200&nbsp;MHz if three or more cores are active (five or more, in the case of Threadripper, and by 300&nbsp;MHz); and significantly further when less than three are active (less than five, in the case of Threadripper).<ref name=\"pcper-xfr\"/>\n** XFR (eXtended Frequency Range) aims to maintain the average clock speed closer to the maximum Precision Boost, when sufficient cooling is available.<ref name=\"robert-hallock-reddit\"/>\n** Neural Net Prediction and Smart Prefetch use [[Multilayer perceptron|perceptron]] based [[Branch_predictor#Neural_branch_prediction|neural branch prediction]] inside the processor to optimize instruction workflow and cache management.\n* Ryzen launched in conjunction with a line of stock coolers for Socket AM4: the Wraith Stealth, Wraith Spire and Wraith Max.

Compared to Piledriver-powered FX chips, Zen-powered Ryzen chips ran cooler, much faster, and used less power. IPC uplift was eventually gauged to be 52% higher than Excavator, which was two full generations ahead of the architecture still being used in AMD's FX-series desktop predecessors like the FX-8350 and FX-8370.<ref name=\"Anand_Ryzen_announcement\"/> Though Zen fell short of Intel's [[Kaby Lake]] in terms of IPC, and therefore single-threaded throughput, it compensated by offering more cores to applications that can use them. Power consumption and heat were found to be highly competitive with Intel, and the included Wraith coolers were generally competitive with higher-priced aftermarket solutions.\n\nRyzen 1800X's multi-threaded performance, in some cases while using [[Blender (software)|Blender]] or other open-source software, was around four times the performance of the FX-8370, or nearly double that of the i7 7700K.<ref name=\"pcworld-ryzen-review\"/> One reviewer found that Ryzen chips would typically outperform competing Intel i7 processors for a fraction of the price when all eight cores were utilized.<ref name=\"pcworld-ryzen-review\"/>\n\nOne complaint among a subset of reviewers, however, was that Ryzen processors fell behind their Intel counterparts when running older games, or running certain newer games at mainstream resolutions such as 720p or 1080p.<ref name=\"extremetech-1800x-review\"/> AMD acknowledged the gaming performance deficit at low resolutions during a Reddit \"Ask Me Anything\" thread, where it explained that updates and patches were being developed.<ref name=\"custompcreview-redditama\"/> Subsequent updates to ''[[Ashes of the Singularity|Ashes of the Singularity: Escalation]]'' and ''[[Rise of the Tomb Raider]]'' increased frame rates by 17 to 31% on Ryzen systems.<ref name=\"pcper-ashes-update\"/><ref name=\"pcper-tombraider-update\"/> Publisher [[id Software]] announced in April 2017 it would optimize its future games to make use of the greater parallelism available on Ryzen CPUs.<ref name=\"techreport-id-ryzen\"/>\n\nIt has been suggested that low threaded applications often result in Ryzen processors being underutilized, producing lower than expected benchmark scores, due to the fact that Zen relies on its core count to make up for its lower [[Instructions per cycle|IPC]] rating than that of Kaby Lake.<ref name=\"techpowerup-linuxkernel\"/><ref name=\"yahoo-ryzen-optim\"/><ref name=\"wccftech-schedulerbug\"/> However, AMD and others have argued thread scheduling is not the fundamental issue to Windows 10 performance.<ref name=\"amdblog-community-update\"/><ref name=\"pcper-scheduler\"/> Early AM4 motherboards were also hindered by BIOS bugs and poor DDR4 memory support.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n== Operating system support==\n===Windows===\nAMD verified that computers with Ryzen CPUs can boot [[Windows 7]] and [[Windows 8]] but on newer hardware, including AMD Ryzen and Intel Kaby Lake and later, [[Microsoft]] only officially supports the use of [[Windows 10]]. [[Windows Update]] blocks updates from being installed on newer systems running older versions of Windows, though that restriction can be circumvented with an unofficial patch.<ref name=\"extremetech-w7-w8-block\"/>\n\nAlthough AMD initially announced that Ryzen chipset drivers would not be provided for Windows 7,<ref name=\"pcworld-windows7-driver\"/> its chipset driver packages do in fact list and include them.<ref name=\"amd.com-support\"/>\n\n===Linux===\nThe full performance of Ryzen processors is available with [[Linux kernel]] version 4.10 or newer.<ref name=\"pcworld-kernel4.10\"/>\n\n==Known issues==\n=== Spectre ===\nLike nearly all modern high performance microprocessors, Ryzen was susceptible to the [[Spectre_(security_vulnerability)|\"Spectre\" vulnerabilities]]. The vulnerabilities can be mitigated without hardware changes via microcode updates and operating system workarounds, but the mitigations incur a performance penalty.<ref name=\"suse-meltdown-spectre\"/> AMD Ryzen and [[Epyc]] suffer a zero to 9% penalty from the mitigations, depending on workload, comparing favorably with a penalty of in some cases more than 50% for Intel [[Intel Core|Core]] and [[Xeon]] processors,<ref name=\"phoronix-mitigation-cost\"/><ref name=\"phoronix-kernel4.20\"/> in part as a result of the AMD processors not requiring mitigation against the related [[Meltdown_(security_vulnerability)|Meltdown vulnerability]].<ref name=\"amd.com-cpusecurity\"/>\n\nLaunched in 2019, Zen 2 includes hardware mitigations against the Spectre V4 speculative store bypass vulnerability.<ref name=\"anand-zen2-analysis\"/><ref name=\"techpowerup-zen2-spectre-mitigations\"/>\n\n===Segmentation fault===\nSome early shipments of Ryzen 1000 series processors

affected processors with newer ones that are not affected by the problem.<ref name=\"extremetech-segfault\"/>\n\n=== Alleged issues by CTS Labs ===\n\nIn early 2018, an Israeli [[Computer

them after giving AMD 24 hours to respond and raising concerns and questions regarding their legitimacy,<ref name=\"toms-CTS\"/><ref name=\"anand-cts1\"/> though they were later confirmed by two

Ryzen is especially significant for AMD, since it is a completely new design, and since it marks the corporation's return to the high end desktop CPU market. AMD's competitor [[Intel]] had controlled this section of the market for almost ten years, since Intel released the [[Conroe (microprocessor)|Conroe/Core microarchitecture]], which displaced AMD's [[Athlon 64]] as the cutting edge of performance in the market.{{clarify|date=February 2020|reason=Supposed to mean first product capable of challenging Intel in ten years or that it will challenge them \"for\" ten years?!

Threadripper uses the larger [[Socket TR4|TR4]] and [[Socket sTRX4|sTRX4]] sockets, which support more memory channels and [[PCI Express]] lanes.<ref name=\"tr_threadripper\"/><ref name=\"ars_threadripper\"/>\n\nIn December 2019, AMD started putting out first generation Ryzen products built using the second generation Zen+ architecture.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wccftech.com/first-gen-amd-ryzen-cpus-are-appearing-with-12nm-zen-architecture/|title=First-Gen AMD Ryzen CPUs are Appearing with 12nm Zen+ Architecture|date=2019-12-22}}</ref> The most notable example is Ryzen 5 1600, with newest batches, having \"AF\" identifier instead of its usual \"AE\", being essentially a rebadged Ryzen 5 2600 with the same specifications as the original Ryzen 5 1600.\n\n==History==\nIn the five years before the release of Ryzen, AMD's direct competitor in the [[x86-64|x86 and x86-64]] consumer-level CPU marketspace, [[Intel]], had continued to grow its market share with the [[Tick-tock model|tick-tock]] improvement cycle of its [[Intel Core| Core]] series of microprocessors.<ref name=\"cpubenchmark_marketshare\"/> Since the release of its [[Bulldozer (microarchitecture)|Bulldozer microarchitecture]] in 2011, AMD's CPUs had fallen progressively behind those from Intel in both single- and multi-core performance.<ref name=\"ars-zendetails\"/> Despite a die shrink and several revisions of the Bulldozer architecture, performance and power efficiency failed to catch up with Intel's competing products.{{cn|date=August 2017}}\n\nRyzen is the consumer-level implementation of the newer [[Zen (microarchitecture)|Zen microarchitecture]], a complete re-design that marked the return of AMD to the high-end CPU market, offering a product stack able to compete with Intel at every level.<ref name=\"ars-zenperformance\"/><ref name=\"toms-ryzen2faq\"/> Having more processing cores, Ryzen processors offer greater multi-threaded performance at the same price point relative to Intel's Core processors.<ref name=\"anand-ryzen1-deepdive-p23\"/> The Zen architecture delivers more than 52% improvement in [[Instructions per cycle|instructions-per-clock cycle]] over the previous-generation Bulldozer AMD core, without increasing power consumption.<ref name=\"amd.com-zencore\"/> \n\nThreadripper, which is geared for high end desktops (HEDT), wasn't developed as part of a business plan or a specific roadmap; instead a small enthusiast team inside AMD saw an opportunity that something could be developed between the Ryzen and Epyc cpu roadmaps that would put the crown of performance on AMD.

Compared to Piledriver-powered FX chips, Zen-powered Ryzen chips ran cooler, much faster, and used less power. IPC uplift was eventually gauged to be 52% higher than Excavator, which was two full generations ahead of the architecture still being used in AMD's FX-series desktop predecessors like the FX-8350 and FX-8370.<ref name=\"Anand_Ryzen_announcement\"/> Though Zen fell short of Intel's [[Kaby Lake]] in terms of IPC, and therefore single-threaded throughput, it compensated by offering more cores to applications that can use them. Power consumption and heat were found to be highly competitive with Intel, and the included Wraith coolers were generally competitive with higher-priced aftermarket solutions.\n\nRyzen 1800X's multi-threaded performance, in some cases while using [[Blender (software)|Blender]] or other open-source software, was around four times the performance of the FX-8370, or nearly double that of the i7 7700K.<ref name=\"pcworld-ryzen-review\"/> One reviewer found that Ryzen chips would typically outperform competing Intel i7 processors for a fraction of the price when all eight cores were utilized.<ref name=\"pcworld-ryzen-review\"/>\n\nOne complaint among a subset of reviewers, however, was that Ryzen processors fell behind their Intel counterparts when running older games, or running certain newer games at mainstream resolutions such as 720p or 1080p.<ref name=\"extremetech-1800x-review\"/> AMD acknowledged the gaming performance deficit at low resolutions during a Reddit \"Ask Me Anything\" thread, where it explained that updates and patches were being developed.<ref name=\"custompcreview-redditama\"/> Subsequent updates to ''[[Ashes of the Singularity|Ashes of the Singularity: Escalation]]'' and ''[[Rise of the Tomb Raider]]'' increased frame rates by 17 to 31% on Ryzen systems.<ref name=\"pcper-ashes-update\"/><ref name=\"pcper-tombraider-update\"/> Publisher [[id Software]] announced in April 2017 it would optimize its future games to make use of the greater parallelism available on Ryzen CPUs.<ref name=\"techreport-id-ryzen\"/>\n\nIt has been suggested that low threaded applications often result in Ryzen processors being underutilized, producing lower than expected benchmark scores, due to the fact that Zen relies on its core count to make up for its lower [[Instructions per cycle|IPC]] rating than that of Kaby Lake.<ref name=\"techpowerup-linuxkernel\"/><ref name=\"yahoo-ryzen-optim\"/><ref name=\"wccftech-schedulerbug\"/> However, AMD and others have argued thread scheduling is not the fundamental issue to Windows 10 performance.<ref name=\"amdblog-community-update\"/><ref name=\"pcper-scheduler\"/> Early AM4 motherboards were also hindered by BIOS bugs and poor DDR4 memory support.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n== Operating system support==\n===Windows===\nAMD verified that computers with Ryzen CPUs can boot [[Windows 7]] and [[Windows 8]] but on newer hardware, including AMD Ryzen and Intel Kaby Lake and later, [[Microsoft]] only officially supports the use of [[Windows 10]]. [[Windows Update]] blocks updates from being installed on newer systems running older versions of Windows, though that restriction can be circumvented with an unofficial patch.<ref name=\"extremetech-w7-w8-block\"/>\n\nAlthough AMD initially announced that Ryzen chipset drivers would not be provided for Windows 7,<ref name=\"pcworld-windows7-driver\"/> its chipset driver packages do in fact list and include them.<ref name=\"amd.com-support\"/>\n\n===Linux===\nThe full performance of Ryzen processors is available with [[Linux kernel]] version 4.10 or newer.<ref name=\"pcworld-kernel4.10\"/>\n\n==Known issues==\n=== Spectre ===\nLike nearly all modern high performance microprocessors, Ryzen was susceptible to the [[Spectre_(security_vulnerability)|\"Spectre\" vulnerabilities]]. The vulnerabilities can be mitigated without hardware changes via microcode updates and operating system workarounds, but the mitigations incur a performance penalty.<ref name=\"suse-meltdown-spectre\"/> AMD Ryzen and [[Epyc]] suffer a zero to 9% penalty from the mitigations, depending on workload, comparing favorably with a penalty of in some cases more than 50% for Intel [[Intel Core|Core]] and [[Xeon]] processors,<ref name=\"phoronix-mitigation-cost\"/><ref name=\"phoronix-kernel4.20\"/> in part as a result of the AMD processors not requiring mitigation against the related [[Meltdown_(security_vulnerability)|Meltdown vulnerability]].<ref name=\"amd.com-cpusecurity\"/>\n\nLaunched in 2019, Zen 2 includes hardware mitigations against the Spectre V4 speculative store bypass vulnerability.<ref name=\"anand-zen2-analysis\"/><ref name=\"techpowerup-zen2-spectre-mitigations\"/>\n\n===Segmentation fault===\nSome early shipments of Ryzen 1000 series processors produced segmentation faults on certain workloads on Linux, especially while compiling code with [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]].<ref name=\"phoronix-ryzen-segfault\"/> AMD offered to replace the affected processors with newer ones that are not affected by the problem.<ref name=\"extremetech-segfault\"/>\n\n=== Alleged issues by CTS Labs ===\n\nIn early 2018, an Israeli [[Computer security|cyber-security]] consultancy firm called CTS Labs stated that they had discovered several major flaws in the Ryzen components ecosystem,<ref name=\"bleeping-cts-vuln\"/> publicly disclosing them after giving AMD 24 hours to respond and raising concerns and questions regarding their legitimacy,<ref name=\"toms-CTS\"/><ref name=\"anand-cts1\"/> though they were later confirmed by two
