The resulting [[cultural exchange]] included the introduction of [[refined sugar]], hand-held [[firearms]], [[galleon]]-style shipbuilding, and [[Christianity]] to Japan. The ''Nanban'' trade declined in the early [[Edo period]] with the rise of the [[Tokugawa Shogunate]] which feared the influence of Christianity in Japan, particularly the [[Roman Catholicism]] of the Portuguese.

They show their feelings without any self-control. They cannot understand the meaning of written characters. (from Boxer, ''Christian Century'').}}\n\nMany foreigners were befriended by Japanese rulers, and their ability was sometimes recognized to the point of promoting one to the rank of [[samurai]] ([[William Adams (sailor, born 1564)|William Adams]]), and giving him a [[fief]] in the [[Miura Peninsula]], south of [[Edo]].\n\n=== European accounts of Japan ===\n{{quote|The island of ''Jampon'', according to what all the Chinese say, is larger than that of the [[Ryukyu Kingdom|''L\u00e9quios'']], and the king is more powerful and greater and is not given to trading, nor are his subjects.

Japan was to become a major exporter of copper and silver during the period.\n\nJapan was also noted for its comparable or exceptional levels of population and urbanisation with the west (see [[List of countries by population in 1600]]), and at the time, some Europeans became quite fascinated with Japan, with [[Alessandro Valignano]] even writing that the Japanese \"excel not only all the other Oriental peoples, they surpass the Europeans as well\".<ref>Valignano, 1584, ''Historia del Principio y Progreso de la Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Jes\u00fas en las Indias Orientales''.</ref>\n\nEarly European visitors noted the quality of Japanese craftsmanship and metalsmithing. This stems from the fact that Japan itself is rather poor in natural resources found commonly in Europe, especially [[iron]]. Thus, the Japanese were famously frugal with their consumable resources; what little they had they used with expert skill though because of this, they had not reached European levels.\n\nJapanese military progress was also well noted. \"A Spanish royal decree of 1609 specifically directed Spanish commanders in the Pacific 'not to risk the reputation of our arms and state against Japanese soldier.'\" (''Giving Up the Gun'', Noel Perrin). Troops of Japanese [[samurai]] were later employed in the [[Maluku Islands]] in [[Southeast Asia]] by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] to fight off the English.\n\n== Portuguese trade in the 16th century ==\n{{See also|Japan voyage}}\n[[File:Viagem do Japao.png|thumb|The Portuguese \"Japan Route\"]]\n[[File:Nanbansen2.jpg|thumb|380px|''Nanban'' ships arriving for trade in Japan. 16th-century six-fold [[lacquer]] and gilded screen.]]\n[[File:Portuguese traders landing in Japan.jpg|thumb|Portuguese traders landing in Japan]]\n[[File:NanbanCarrack.jpg|thumb|A Portuguese [[carrack]] in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], 17th century.]]\n\nEver since 1514 that the Portuguese had traded with [[Ming dynasty|China]] from [[Portuguese Malacca|Malacca]], and the year after the first Portuguese landfall in Japan, trade commenced between Malacca, China, and Japan.

Their pilot was [[William Adams (sailor, born 1564)|William Adams]], the first Englishman to reach Japan.\n\nIn 1605, two of the ''Liefde'''s crew were sent to [[Pattani kingdom|Pattani]] by Tokugawa Ieyasu, to invite Dutch trade to Japan. The head of the Pattani Dutch trading post, Victor Sprinckel, refused on the ground that he was too busy dealing with Portuguese opposition in Southeast Asia. In 1609 however, the Dutchman [[Jacques Specx]] arrived with two ships in Hirado, and through Adams obtained trading privileges from Ieyasu.\n\nThe [[Netherlands|Dutch]] also engaged in piracy and naval combat to weaken [[Portugal|Portuguese]] and Spanish shipping in the Pacific, and ultimately became the only westerners to be allowed access to Japan from the small enclave of [[Dejima]] after 1638 and for the next two centuries.\n\n[[File:JapaneseTrade17thCentury.jpg|thumb|280px|Japanese [[Red seal ship|Red seal trade]] in the early 17th century.<ref>\"Histoire du Japon\", p. 72, Michel Vie, {{ISBN|2-13-052893-7}}</ref>]]\n\n== Technological and cultural exchanges ==\nThe Japanese were introduced to several new technologies and cultural practices (so were the Europeans to Japanese, see [[Japonism]]), whether in the military area (the [[arquebus]], European-style [[cuirass]]es, European ships), religion ([[Christianity]]), [[Art of Europe|decorative art]], language (integration to Japanese of a [[Japanese language#Vocabulary|Western vocabulary]]) and culinary: the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] introduced the [[tempura]]  and above all the valuable refined sugar, creating {{nihongo|[[Wagashi|''nanbangashi'']]|\u5357\u86ee\u83d3\u5b50}}, \"southern barbarian confectionery\", with confectioneries like ''[[castella]]'', ''[[konpeit\u014d]]'', ''aruheit\u014d'', ''karumera'', ''keiran s\u014dmen'', ''b\u014dro'' and ''[[Biscuit|bisukauto]]''.\n\n=== Tanegashima guns===\n{{main|Firearms of Japan}}\n[[File:TanegashimaGun.jpg|thumb|Tanegashima gun]]\n[[File:EdoJapaneseArquebuse.jpg|thumb|Japanese [[arquebus]] of the [[Edo era]] (Tanegasima).]]\nThe Japanese were interested in Portuguese hand-held [[gun]]s. The first two Europeans to reach Japan in the year 1543 were the Portuguese traders [[Ant\u00f3nio Mota|Ant\u00f3nio da Mota]] and Francisco Zeimoto ([[Fern\u00e3o Mendes Pinto]] claimed to have arrived on this ship as well, but this is in direct conflict with other data he presents), arriving on a Chinese ship at the southern island of [[Tanegashima]] where they introduced hand-held guns for trade. The Japanese were already familiar with [[gunpowder]] weaponry (invented by, and transmitted from China), and had been using basic Chinese originated guns and cannon tubes called \"''Tepp\u014d''\" (\u9244\u7832 \"Iron cannon\") for around 270 years before the arrival of the Portuguese. In comparison, the Portuguese guns were light, had a [[matchlock]] firing mechanism, and were easy to aim. Because the Portuguese-made firearms were introduced into Tanegashima, the [[arquebus]] was ultimately called Tanegashima in Japan. At that time, Japan was in the middle of a civil war called the [[Sengoku period]] (Warring States period).\n\nWithin a year after the first trade in guns, Japanese swordsmiths and ironsmiths managed to reproduce the matchlock mechanism and mass-produce the Portuguese guns. Barely fifty years later, ''\"by the end of the 16th century, guns were almost certainly more common in Japan than in any other country in the world\"'', its armies equipped with a number of guns dwarfing any contemporary army in Europe (Perrin). The guns were strongly instrumental in the unification of Japan under [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] and [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], as well as in the [[Hideyoshi's invasions of Korea|invasions of Korea]] in 1592 and 1597.  The daimyo who initiated the unification of Japan, [[Oda Nobunaga]], made extensive use of guns ([[arquebus]]) when playing a key role in the [[Battle of Nagashino]], as dramatised in [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s 1980 film ''[[Kagemusha]]'' (Shadow Warrior).\n\n=== Red seal ships ===\n{{Main|Red seal ships}}\n\n[[File:RedSealShip.JPG|thumb|180px|left|A 1634 Japanese [[Red seal ship]], incorporating Western-style square and [[lateen]] sails, [[rudder]] and aft designs.

These ships incorporated many elements of [[galleon]] design, such as sails, rudder, and gun disposition. They brought to Southeast Asian ports many Japanese traders and adventurers, who sometimes became quite influential in local affairs, such as the adventurer [[Yamada Nagamasa]] in [[Siam]], or later became Japanese popular icons, such as [[Tenjiku Tokubei]].\n\nBy the beginning of the 17th century, the shogunate had built, usually with the help of foreign experts, several ships of purely ''Nanban'' design, such as the galleon [[Japanese warship San Juan Bautista|''San Juan Bautista'']], which crossed the Pacific two times on embassies to [[Nueva Espana|Nueva Espa\u00f1a]] (Mexico).\n\n=== Catholicism in Japan ===\n{{main|Kirishitan}}\n[[File:Bell of Nanban-ji.JPG|thumb|The [[Shunk\u014d-in|Bell of Nanbanji]], made in Portugal for ''Nanbanji'' Church, established by Jesuits in 1576 and destroyed 1587, Japan]]\n[[File:Oda Nobunaga-Portrait by Giovanni NIcolao.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Oda Nobunaga]], by [[Jesuit]] painter [[Giovanni Niccolo]], 1583\u20131590.]]\nWith the arrival of the leading [[Jesuit]] [[Francis Xavier]] in 1549, Catholicism progressively developed as a major religious force in Japan. Although the tolerance of Western \"padres\" was initially linked to trade, Catholics could claim around 200,000 converts by the end of the 16th century, mainly located in the southern island of [[Ky\u016bsh\u016b]]. The Jesuits managed to obtain jurisdiction over the trading city of [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]].\n\nThe first reaction from the [[kampaku]] [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi|Hideyoshi]] came in 1587 when he promulgated the interdiction of Christianity and ordered the departure of all \"padres\". This resolution was not followed upon however (only 3 out of 130 Jesuits left Japan), and the Jesuits were essentially able to pursue their activities. Hideyoshi had written that<br />\n:''\"1. Japan is a country of the Gods, and for the padres to come hither and preach a devilish law, is a reprehensible and devilish thing&nbsp;... \n:''2. For the padres to come to Japan and convert people to their creed, destroying Shinto and Buddhist temples to this end, is a hitherto unseen and unheard-of thing&nbsp;... to stir the canaille to commit outrages of this sort is something deserving of severe punishment.\"'' (From Boxer, ''The Christian Century in Japan'')\n\nHideyoshi's reaction to Christianity proved stronger when the Spanish [[galleon]] ''[[San Felipe incident (1596)|San Felipe]]'' was wrecked in Japan in 1597. The incident led to [[Martyrdom of the 26 Saints of Japan|twenty-six Christians]] (6 Franciscans, 17 of their Japanese neophytes, and 3 Japanese Jesuit lay brothers \u2013 included by mistake) being crucified in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] on February 5, 1597. It seems Hideyoshi's decision was taken following encouragements by the Jesuits to expel the rival order, his being informed by the Spanish that military conquest usually followed Catholic proselytism, and by his own desire to take over the cargo of the ship. Although close to a hundred churches were destroyed, most of the Jesuits remained in Japan.\n\nThe final blow came with [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]]'s firm interdiction of Christianity in 1614, which led to underground activities by the [[Jesuits]] and to their participation in [[Toyotomi Hideyori|Hideyori]]'s revolt in the [[Siege of Osaka]] (1614\u201315). Repression of Catholicism became virulent after Ieyasu's death in 1616, leading to the torturing and killing of around 2,000 Christians (70 westerners and the rest Japanese) and the apostasy of the remaining 200\u2013300,000. The last major reaction of the Christians in Japan was the [[Shimabara rebellion]] in 1637.  Thereafter, Catholicism in Japan was driven underground as the so-called [[Kakure Kirishitan|\"Hidden Christians\"]].\n\n=== Other ''Nanban'' influences ===\nThe Nanban also had various other influences:\n* '''''Nanband\u014d''''' ([[:ja:\u5357\u86ee\u80f4|\u5357\u86ee\u80f4]]) designates a type of cuirass covering the trunk in one piece, a design imported from Europe.\n* '''''Nanbanbijutsu''''' ([[:ja:\u5357\u86ee\u7f8e\u8853|\u5357\u86ee\u7f8e\u8853]]) generally describes Japanese art with Nanban themes or influenced by Nanban designs(See [[Nanban art]]).\n* '''''Nanbanga''''' (\u5357\u86ee\u753b) designates the numerous pictorial representations that were made of the new foreigners and defines a whole style category in Japanese art (See [[Namban art]] and an example at:[https://web.archive.org/web/20040505173017/http://www.rekihaku.ac.jp/koohoo/journal/no122/byobu2.jpg] or [https://web.archive.org/web/20041210083000/http://www.rekihaku.ac.jp/koohoo/journal/no122/byobu1.jpg])\n* '''''Nanbannuri''''' (\u5357\u86ee\u5857\u308a) describes lacquers decorated in the Portuguese style, which were very popular items from the late 16th century (See example at: [https://web.archive.org/web/20050117183344/http://www.jti.co.jp/Culture/museum/tokubetu/eventApr00/gif/coffer.gif]).\n* '''''Nanbangashi''''' ([[:ja:\u5357\u86ee\u83d3\u5b50|\u5357\u86ee\u83d3\u5b50]]) is a variety of sweets derived from Portuguese or Spanish recipes.

With support from [[Oda Nobunaga]], the [[Jesuit]] Padre [[Gnecchi-Soldo Organtino]] established this church in 1576. Eleven years later (1587), Nanbanji was destroyed by [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]. Currently, The bell is preserved as \"Nanbanji-no-kane\" (the Bell of Nanbanji) at [[Shunkoin temple]] in Kyoto.[http://www.shunkoin.com/ Shunkoin Temple]\n\n==Decline of ''Nanban'' exchanges==\nAfter the country was pacified and unified by [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] in 1603 however, Japan progressively closed itself to the outside world, mainly because of the rise of [[Christianity]].\n\nBy 1650, except for the trade outpost of [[Dejima]] in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], for the Netherlands, and some trade with China, foreigners were subject to the death penalty, and Christian converts were persecuted. Guns were almost completely eradicated to revert to the more \"civilized\" sword.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Travel abroad and the building of large ships were also prohibited. Thence started a period of seclusion, peace, prosperity and mild progress known as the [[Edo period]].  But not long after, in the 1650s, the production of [[Japanese export porcelain]] increased greatly when civil war put the main Chinese center of porcelain production, [[Jingdezhen porcelain|in Jingdezhen]], out of action for several decades. For the rest of the 17th century most [[Japanese porcelain]] production was in [[Kyushu]] for export through the Chinese and Dutch. The trade dwindled under renewed Chinese competition by the 1740s, before resuming after the opening of Japan in 1850's.<ref>[[David Battie|Battie, David]], ed., ''Sotheby's Concise Encyclopedia of Porcelain'', pp. 71-78, 1990, Conran Octopus. {{ISBN|1850292515}}</ref>\n\nThe \"barbarians\" would come back 250 years later, strengthened by industrialization, and end Japan's isolation with the forcible opening of Japan to trade by an American military fleet under the command of [[Matthew Perry (naval officer)|Commodore Matthew Perry]] in 1854.\n\n== Usages of the word \"''Nanban''\" ==\n[[File:JapaneseVotiveAltar.JPG|thumb|A Japanese votive altar, Nanban style. End of 16th century. [[Guimet Museum]].]]\n[[File:NanbanDo.jpg|thumb|'''Nanband\u014d''', a western-style cuirass, 16th century.]]\n[[File:InroWithNanbanForeigners.jpg|thumb|Japanese [[inro]] depicting Nanban foreigners, 17th century.]]\n\n''Nanban'' is a [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|Sino-Japanese word]] derived from the Chinese term ''[[Nanman|N\u00e1nm\u00e1n]]'', originally referring to the peoples of [[South Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. The Japanese use of ''Nanban'' took a new meaning when it came to designate the early Portuguese who first arrived in 1543, and later extended to other Europeans that arrived in Japan. The term ''Nanban'' has its origins from the [[Four Barbarians]] in the [[Hua\u2013Yi distinction]] in the 3rd century in China. Pronunciation of the Chinese Character is [[Japanization|Japanised]], the \u6771\u5937 (D\u014dngy\u00ed) \"Eastern Barbarians\" called \"T\u014di\" (it includes Japan itself), \u5357\u86ee (N\u00e1nm\u00e1n) \"Southern Barbarians\" called \"Nanban\", \u897f\u620e (X\u012br\u00f3ng) \"Western Barbarians\" called \"Sei-J\u016b\", and B\u011bid\u00ed \u5317\u72c4 \"Northern Barbarians\" called \"Hoku-Teki\". Although ''Nanban'' just meant Southeast Asia during the Sengoku and Edo periods, through time the word turned into the meaning \"Western person\", and \"from Nanban\" means \"Exotic and Curious\".\n\nStrictly speaking, ''Nanban'' means \"Portuguese or Spanish\" who were the most popular western foreigners in Japan, while other western people were sometimes called \"\u7d05\u6bdb\u4eba\" (K\u014d-m\u014djin) \"red-haired people\" but K\u014d-m\u014djin was not as widespread as ''Nanban''. In China, \"\u7d05\u6bdb\" is pronounced [[Ang mo]] in [[Hokkien]] and is a racial slur against [[white people]]. Japan later decided to Westernize radically in order to better resist the West and essentially stopped considering the West as fundamentally uncivilized. Words like \"''Y\u014dfu''\" (\u6d0b\u98a8 \"western style\") and \"''\u014cbeifu''\" (\u6b27\u7c73\u98a8 \"European-American style)\" replaced \"''Nanban''\" in most usages.\n\nStill, the exact principle of westernization was ''Wakon-Y\u014dsai'' (\u548c\u9b42\u6d0b\u624d \"Japanese spirit Western talent\"), implying that, although technology may be more advanced in the West, Japanese spirit is better than the West's. Hence though the West may be lacking, it has its strong points, which takes the affront out of calling it \"barbarian.\"\n\nToday the word \"''Nanban''\" is only used in a historical context, and is essentially felt as picturesque and affectionate. It can sometimes be used jokingly to refer to Western people or civilization in a cultured manner.\n\nThere is an area where ''Nanban'' is used exclusively to refer to a certain style and that is cooking and the names of dishes.\nNanban dishes are not American or European, but an odd variety not using [[soy sauce]] or [[miso]] but rather curry powder and vinegar as their flavoring, a characteristic derived from Indo-Portuguese [[Goan cuisine]]. This is because when Portuguese and Spanish dishes were imported into Japan, dishes from Macau and other parts of China were imported as well.\n\n== Timeline ==\n* 1543 \u2013 Portuguese sailors (among them possibly [[Fern\u00e3o Mendes Pinto]]) arrive in [[Tanegashima]] and transmit the [[arquebus]].\n* 1549 \u2013 [[Francis Xavier]] arrives in [[Kagoshima]].\n* 1557 \u2013 Establishment of [[Portuguese Macau|Macau]] by the Portuguese.

The resulting [[cultural exchange]] included the introduction of [[refined sugar]], hand-held [[firearms]], [[galleon]]-style shipbuilding, and [[Christianity]] to Japan. The ''Nanban'' trade declined in the early [[Edo period]] with the rise of the [[Tokugawa Shogunate]] which feared the influence of Christianity in Japan, particularly the [[Roman Catholicism]] of the Portuguese. The Tokugawa issued a series of ''Sakoku'' policies that increasingly isolated Japan from the outside world and limited European trade to [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] traders on the island of [[Dejima]].\n\nCommunities are campaigning for the influential ''Nanban'' route's inclusion in the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage List]].\n\n[[File:Hokusai 1817 First Guns in Japan.jpg|thumb|First Westerners in Japan, by [[Hokusai]], 1817.

They show their feelings without any self-control. They cannot understand the meaning of written characters. (from Boxer, ''Christian Century'').}}\n\nMany foreigners were befriended by Japanese rulers, and their ability was sometimes recognized to the point of promoting one to the rank of [[samurai]] ([[William Adams (sailor, born 1564)|William Adams]]), and giving him a [[fief]] in the [[Miura Peninsula]], south of [[Edo]].\n\n=== European accounts of Japan ===\n{{quote|The island of ''Jampon'', according to what all the Chinese say, is larger than that of the [[Ryukyu Kingdom|''L\u00e9quios'']], and the king is more powerful and greater and is not given to trading, nor are his subjects.

Japan was to become a major exporter of copper and silver during the period.\n\nJapan was also noted for its comparable or exceptional levels of population and urbanisation with the west (see [[List of countries by population in 1600]]), and at the time, some Europeans became quite fascinated with Japan, with [[Alessandro Valignano]] even writing that the Japanese \"excel not only all the other Oriental peoples, they surpass the Europeans as well\".<ref>Valignano, 1584, ''Historia del Principio y Progreso de la Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Jes\u00fas en las Indias Orientales''.</ref>\n\nEarly European visitors noted the quality of Japanese craftsmanship and metalsmithing. This stems from the fact that Japan itself is rather poor in natural resources found commonly in Europe, especially [[iron]]. Thus, the Japanese were famously frugal with their consumable resources; what little they had they used with expert skill though because of this, they had not reached European levels.\n\nJapanese military progress was also well noted. \"A Spanish royal decree of 1609 specifically directed Spanish commanders in the Pacific 'not to risk the reputation of our arms and state against Japanese soldier.'\" (''Giving Up the Gun'', Noel Perrin). Troops of Japanese [[samurai]] were later employed in the [[Maluku Islands]] in [[Southeast Asia]] by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] to fight off the English.\n\n== Portuguese trade in the 16th century ==\n{{See also|Japan voyage}}\n[[File:Viagem do Japao.png|thumb|The Portuguese \"Japan Route\"]]\n[[File:Nanbansen2.jpg|thumb|380px|''Nanban'' ships arriving for trade in Japan. 16th-century six-fold [[lacquer]] and gilded screen.]]\n[[File:Portuguese traders landing in Japan.jpg|thumb|Portuguese traders landing in Japan]]\n[[File:NanbanCarrack.jpg|thumb|A Portuguese [[carrack]] in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], 17th century.]]\n\nEver since 1514 that the Portuguese had traded with [[Ming dynasty|China]] from [[Portuguese Malacca|Malacca]], and the year after the first Portuguese landfall in Japan, trade commenced between Malacca, China, and Japan.

Their pilot was [[William Adams (sailor, born 1564)|William Adams]], the first Englishman to reach Japan.\n\nIn 1605, two of the ''Liefde'''s crew were sent to [[Pattani kingdom|Pattani]] by Tokugawa Ieyasu, to invite Dutch trade to Japan. The head of the Pattani Dutch trading post, Victor Sprinckel, refused on the ground that he was too busy dealing with Portuguese opposition in Southeast Asia. In 1609 however, the Dutchman [[Jacques Specx]] arrived with two ships in Hirado, and through Adams obtained trading privileges from Ieyasu.\n\nThe [[Netherlands|Dutch]] also engaged in piracy and naval combat to weaken [[Portugal|Portuguese]] and Spanish shipping in the Pacific, and ultimately became the only westerners to be allowed access to Japan from the small enclave of [[Dejima]] after 1638 and for the next two centuries.\n\n[[File:JapaneseTrade17thCentury.jpg|thumb|280px|Japanese [[Red seal ship|Red seal trade]] in the early 17th century.<ref>\"Histoire du Japon\", p. 72, Michel Vie, {{ISBN|2-13-052893-7}}</ref>]]\n\n== Technological and cultural exchanges ==\nThe Japanese were introduced to several new technologies and cultural practices (so were the Europeans to Japanese, see [[Japonism]]), whether in the military area (the [[arquebus]], European-style [[cuirass]]es, European ships), religion ([[Christianity]]), [[Art of Europe|decorative art]], language (integration to Japanese of a [[Japanese language#Vocabulary|Western vocabulary]]) and culinary: the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] introduced the [[tempura]]  and above all the valuable refined sugar, creating {{nihongo|[[Wagashi|''nanbangashi'']]|\u5357\u86ee\u83d3\u5b50}}, \"southern barbarian confectionery\", with confectioneries like ''[[castella]]'', ''[[konpeit\u014d]]'', ''aruheit\u014d'', ''karumera'', ''keiran s\u014dmen'', ''b\u014dro'' and ''[[Biscuit|bisukauto]]''.\n\n=== Tanegashima guns===\n{{main|Firearms of Japan}}\n[[File:TanegashimaGun.jpg|thumb|Tanegashima gun]]\n[[File:EdoJapaneseArquebuse.jpg|thumb|Japanese [[arquebus]] of the [[Edo era]] (Tanegasima).]]\nThe Japanese were interested in Portuguese hand-held [[gun]]s. The first two Europeans to reach Japan in the year 1543 were the Portuguese traders [[Ant\u00f3nio Mota|Ant\u00f3nio da Mota]] and Francisco Zeimoto ([[Fern\u00e3o Mendes Pinto]] claimed to have arrived on this ship as well, but this is in direct conflict with other data he presents), arriving on a Chinese ship at the southern island of [[Tanegashima]] where they introduced hand-held guns for trade. The Japanese were already familiar with [[gunpowder]] weaponry (invented by, and transmitted from China), and had been using basic Chinese originated guns and cannon tubes called \"''Tepp\u014d''\" (\u9244\u7832 \"Iron cannon\") for around 270 years before the arrival of the Portuguese. In comparison, the Portuguese guns were light, had a [[matchlock]] firing mechanism, and were easy to aim. Because the Portuguese-made firearms were introduced into Tanegashima, the [[arquebus]] was ultimately called Tanegashima in Japan. At that time, Japan was in the middle of a civil war called the [[Sengoku period]] (Warring States period).\n\nWithin a year after the first trade in guns, Japanese swordsmiths and ironsmiths managed to reproduce the matchlock mechanism and mass-produce the Portuguese guns. Barely fifty years later, ''\"by the end of the 16th century, guns were almost certainly more common in Japan than in any other country in the world\"'', its armies equipped with a number of guns dwarfing any contemporary army in Europe (Perrin). The guns were strongly instrumental in the unification of Japan under [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] and [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], as well as in the [[Hideyoshi's invasions of Korea|invasions of Korea]] in 1592 and 1597.  The daimyo who initiated the unification of Japan, [[Oda Nobunaga]], made extensive use of guns ([[arquebus]]) when playing a key role in the [[Battle of Nagashino]], as dramatised in [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s 1980 film ''[[Kagemusha]]'' (Shadow Warrior).\n\n=== Red seal ships ===\n{{Main|Red seal ships}}\n\n[[File:RedSealShip.JPG|thumb|180px|left|A 1634 Japanese [[Red seal ship]], incorporating Western-style square and [[lateen]] sails, [[rudder]] and aft designs. The ships were typically armed with 6 to 8 cannons.

These ships incorporated many elements of [[galleon]] design, such as sails, rudder, and gun disposition. They brought to Southeast Asian ports many Japanese traders and adventurers, who sometimes became quite influential in local affairs, such as the adventurer [[Yamada Nagamasa]] in [[Siam]], or later became Japanese popular icons, such as [[Tenjiku Tokubei]].\n\nBy the beginning of the 17th century, the shogunate had built, usually with the help of foreign experts, several ships of purely ''Nanban'' design, such as the galleon [[Japanese warship San Juan Bautista|''San Juan Bautista'']], which crossed the Pacific two times on embassies to [[Nueva Espana|Nueva Espa\u00f1a]] (Mexico).\n\n=== Catholicism in Japan ===\n{{main|Kirishitan}}\n[[File:Bell of Nanban-ji.JPG|thumb|The [[Shunk\u014d-in|Bell of Nanbanji]], made in Portugal for ''Nanbanji'' Church, established by Jesuits in 1576 and destroyed 1587, Japan]]\n[[File:Oda Nobunaga-Portrait by Giovanni NIcolao.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Oda Nobunaga]], by [[Jesuit]] painter [[Giovanni Niccolo]], 1583\u20131590.]]\nWith the arrival of the leading [[Jesuit]] [[Francis Xavier]] in 1549, Catholicism progressively developed as a major religious force in Japan. Although the tolerance of Western \"padres\" was initially linked to trade, Catholics could claim around 200,000 converts by the end of the 16th century, mainly located in the southern island of [[Ky\u016bsh\u016b]]. The Jesuits managed to obtain jurisdiction over the trading city of [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]].\n\nThe first reaction from the [[kampaku]] [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi|Hideyoshi]] came in 1587 when he promulgated the interdiction of Christianity and ordered the departure of all \"padres\". This resolution was not followed upon however (only 3 out of 130 Jesuits left Japan), and the Jesuits were essentially able to pursue their activities. Hideyoshi had written that<br />\n:''\"1. Japan is a country of the Gods, and for the padres to come hither and preach a devilish law, is a reprehensible and devilish thing&nbsp;... \n:''2. For the padres to come to Japan and convert people to their creed, destroying Shinto and Buddhist temples to this end, is a hitherto unseen and unheard-of thing&nbsp;... to stir the canaille to commit outrages of this sort is something deserving of severe punishment.\"'' (From Boxer, ''The Christian Century in Japan'')\n\nHideyoshi's reaction to Christianity proved stronger when the Spanish [[galleon]] ''[[San Felipe incident (1596)|San Felipe]]'' was wrecked in Japan in 1597. The incident led to [[Martyrdom of the 26 Saints of Japan|twenty-six Christians]] (6 Franciscans, 17 of their Japanese neophytes, and 3 Japanese Jesuit lay brothers \u2013 included by mistake) being crucified in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] on February 5, 1597. It seems Hideyoshi's decision was taken following encouragements by the Jesuits to expel the rival order, his being informed by the Spanish that military conquest usually followed Catholic proselytism, and by his own desire to take over the cargo of the ship. Although close to a hundred churches were destroyed, most of the Jesuits remained in Japan.\n\nThe final blow came with [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]]'s firm interdiction of Christianity in 1614, which led to underground activities by the [[Jesuits]] and to their participation in [[Toyotomi Hideyori|Hideyori]]'s revolt in the [[Siege of Osaka]] (1614\u201315). Repression of Catholicism became virulent after Ieyasu's death in 1616, leading to the torturing and killing of around 2,000 Christians (70 westerners and the rest Japanese) and the apostasy of the remaining 200\u2013300,000. The last major reaction of the Christians in Japan was the [[Shimabara rebellion]] in 1637.  Thereafter, Catholicism in Japan was driven underground as the so-called [[Kakure Kirishitan|\"Hidden Christians\"]].\n\n=== Other ''Nanban'' influences ===\nThe Nanban also had various other influences:\n* '''''Nanband\u014d''''' ([[:ja:\u5357\u86ee\u80f4|\u5357\u86ee\u80f4]]) designates a type of cuirass covering the trunk in one piece, a design imported from Europe.\n* '''''Nanbanbijutsu''''' ([[:ja:\u5357\u86ee\u7f8e\u8853|\u5357\u86ee\u7f8e\u8853]]) generally describes Japanese art with Nanban themes or influenced by Nanban designs(See [[Nanban art]]).\n* '''''Nanbanga''''' (\u5357\u86ee\u753b) designates the numerous pictorial representations that were made of the new foreigners and defines a whole style category in Japanese art (See [[Namban art]] and an example at:[https://web.archive.org/web/20040505173017/http://www.rekihaku.ac.jp/koohoo/journal/no122/byobu2.jpg] or [https://web.archive.org/web/20041210083000/http://www.rekihaku.ac.jp/koohoo/journal/no122/byobu1.jpg])\n* '''''Nanbannuri''''' (\u5357\u86ee\u5857\u308a) describes lacquers decorated in the Portuguese style, which were very popular items from the late 16th century (See example at: [https://web.archive.org/web/20050117183344/http://www.jti.co.jp/Culture/museum/tokubetu/eventApr00/gif/coffer.gif]).\n* '''''Nanbangashi''''' ([[:ja:\u5357\u86ee\u83d3\u5b50|\u5357\u86ee\u83d3\u5b50]]) is a variety of sweets derived from Portuguese or Spanish recipes.

Guns were almost completely eradicated to revert to the more \"civilized\" sword.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Travel abroad and the building of large ships were also prohibited. Thence started a period of seclusion, peace, prosperity and mild progress known as the [[Edo period]].  But not long after, in the 1650s, the production of [[Japanese export porcelain]] increased greatly when civil war put the main Chinese center of porcelain production, [[Jingdezhen porcelain|in Jingdezhen]], out of action for several decades. For the rest of the 17th century most [[Japanese porcelain]] production was in [[Kyushu]] for export through the Chinese and Dutch. The trade dwindled under renewed Chinese competition by the 1740s, before resuming after the opening of Japan in 1850's.<ref>[[David Battie|Battie, David]], ed., ''Sotheby's Concise Encyclopedia of Porcelain'', pp. 71-78, 1990, Conran Octopus. {{ISBN|1850292515}}</ref>\n\nThe \"barbarians\" would come back 250 years later, strengthened by industrialization, and end Japan's isolation with the forcible opening of Japan to trade by an American military fleet under the command of [[Matthew Perry (naval officer)|Commodore Matthew Perry]] in 1854.\n\n== Usages of the word \"''Nanban''\" ==\n[[File:JapaneseVotiveAltar.JPG|thumb|A Japanese votive altar, Nanban style. End of 16th century. [[Guimet Museum]].]]\n[[File:NanbanDo.jpg|thumb|'''Nanband\u014d''', a western-style cuirass, 16th century.]]\n[[File:InroWithNanbanForeigners.jpg|thumb|Japanese [[inro]] depicting Nanban foreigners, 17th century.]]\n\n''Nanban'' is a [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|Sino-Japanese word]] derived from the Chinese term ''[[Nanman|N\u00e1nm\u00e1n]]'', originally referring to the peoples of [[South Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. The Japanese use of ''Nanban'' took a new meaning when it came to designate the early Portuguese who first arrived in 1543, and later extended to other Europeans that arrived in Japan. The term ''Nanban'' has its origins from the [[Four Barbarians]] in the [[Hua\u2013Yi distinction]] in the 3rd century in China. Pronunciation of the Chinese Character is [[Japanization|Japanised]], the \u6771\u5937 (D\u014dngy\u00ed) \"Eastern Barbarians\" called \"T\u014di\" (it includes Japan itself), \u5357\u86ee (N\u00e1nm\u00e1n) \"Southern Barbarians\" called \"Nanban\", \u897f\u620e (X\u012br\u00f3ng) \"Western Barbarians\" called \"Sei-J\u016b\", and B\u011bid\u00ed \u5317\u72c4 \"Northern Barbarians\" called \"Hoku-Teki\". Although ''Nanban'' just meant Southeast Asia during the Sengoku and Edo periods, through time the word turned into the meaning \"Western person\", and \"from Nanban\" means \"Exotic and Curious\".\n\nStrictly speaking, ''Nanban'' means \"Portuguese or Spanish\" who were the most popular western foreigners in Japan, while other western people were sometimes called \"\u7d05\u6bdb\u4eba\" (K\u014d-m\u014djin) \"red-haired people\" but K\u014d-m\u014djin was not as widespread as ''Nanban''. In China, \"\u7d05\u6bdb\" is pronounced [[Ang mo]] in [[Hokkien]] and is a racial slur against [[white people]]. Japan later decided to Westernize radically in order to better resist the West and essentially stopped considering the West as fundamentally uncivilized. Words like \"''Y\u014dfu''\" (\u6d0b\u98a8 \"western style\") and \"''\u014cbeifu''\" (\u6b27\u7c73\u98a8 \"European-American style)\" replaced \"''Nanban''\" in most usages.\n\nStill, the exact principle of westernization was ''Wakon-Y\u014dsai'' (\u548c\u9b42\u6d0b\u624d \"Japanese spirit Western talent\"), implying that, although technology may be more advanced in the West, Japanese spirit is better than the West's. Hence though the West may be lacking, it has its strong points, which takes the affront out of calling it \"barbarian.\"\n\nToday the word \"''Nanban''\" is only used in a historical context, and is essentially felt as picturesque and affectionate. It can sometimes be used jokingly to refer to Western people or civilization in a cultured manner.\n\nThere is an area where ''Nanban'' is used exclusively to refer to a certain style and that is cooking and the names of dishes.\nNanban dishes are not American or European, but an odd variety not using [[soy sauce]] or [[miso]] but rather curry powder and vinegar as their flavoring, a characteristic derived from Indo-Portuguese [[Goan cuisine]]. This is because when Portuguese and Spanish dishes were imported into Japan, dishes from Macau and other parts of China were imported as well.\n\n== Timeline ==\n* 1543 \u2013 Portuguese sailors (among them possibly [[Fern\u00e3o Mendes Pinto]]) arrive in [[Tanegashima]] and transmit the [[arquebus]].\n* 1549 \u2013 [[Francis Xavier]] arrives in [[Kagoshima]].\n* 1557 \u2013 Establishment of [[Portuguese Macau|Macau]] by the Portuguese.

He served in [[Sarawak]] from 1959 to 1963. He became [[Governor of Fiji]] in 1964, serving until 1968. It was during his tenure that a measure of self-government was introduced to Fiji in 1964, followed by [[responsible government]] 1967, in preparation for the granting of independence in 1970.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bain|first1=Kenneth|title=Obituary: Sir Derek Jakeway|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-sir-derek-jakeway-1503935.html|website=The Independent|accessdate=6 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe first part of this two-stage process involved appointing members of the [[Legislative Council of Fiji|Legislative Council]] to oversee government departments. Only 18 of the 37 Legislative Council members were popularly elected; these eighteen were equally divided between the three principal ethnic groups - [[Fijians]], [[Indians in Fiji|Indo-Fijians]], and Europeans. The six elected members of each ethnic group were allowed to nominate two of their own members to serve on the [[Executive Council of Fiji|Executive Council]]. This \"Member system\", as it was known, did not introduce a [[Cabinet (politics)|Cabinet]] in the modern sense: Members so appointed were responsible only to the Governor, not to the Legislative Council. But it was a crucial stepping stone to the second stage: following [[1966 Fijian general election|elections in 1966]] - to a reconstituted Legislative Council that was, for the first time, wholly elected (except for two members nominated by the [[Great Council of Chiefs]]) - responsible government was introduced, with a [[Chief Minister of Fiji|Chief Minister]] and a [[Cabinet of Fiji|Cabinet]] responsible to the Legislative Council.

He served in [[Sarawak]] from 1959 to 1963. He became [[Governor of Fiji]] in 1964, serving until 1968. It was during his tenure that a measure of self-government was introduced to Fiji in 1964, followed by [[responsible government]] 1967, in preparation for the granting of independence in 1970.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bain|first1=Kenneth|title=Obituary: Sir Derek Jakeway|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-sir-derek-jakeway-1503935.html|website=The Independent|accessdate=6 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe first part of this two-stage process involved appointing members of the [[Legislative Council of Fiji|Legislative Council]] to oversee government departments. Only 18 of the 37 Legislative Council members were popularly elected; these eighteen were equally divided between the three principal ethnic groups - [[Fijians]], [[Indians in Fiji|Indo-Fijians]], and [[Europeans]]. The six elected members of each ethnic group were allowed to nominate two of their own members to serve on the [[Executive Council of Fiji|Executive Council]]. This \"Member system\", as it was known, did not introduce a [[Cabinet (politics)|Cabinet]] in the modern sense: Members so appointed were responsible only to the Governor, not to the Legislative Council. But it was a crucial stepping stone to the second stage: following [[1966 Fijian general election|elections in 1966]] - to a reconstituted Legislative Council that was, for the first time, wholly elected (except for two members nominated by the [[Great Council of Chiefs]]) - responsible government was introduced, with a [[Chief Minister of Fiji|Chief Minister]] and a [[Cabinet of Fiji|Cabinet]] responsible to the Legislative Council. Jakeway appointed [[Ratu]] [[Kamisese Mara]], leader of the [[Alliance Party (Fiji)|Alliance Party]], which had handily won the election, as Chief Minister.\n\nJakeway was succeeded as Governor by Sir [[Robert Sidney Foster]] in 1968 and retired to [[Exmouth, Devon]], where he became Chairman of the British Health Authority, from which he retired in 1977.\n\n== Personal life ==\nJakeway married Phyllis Watson in 1941.
