The buildings would have been single-storied, made of [[wattle-and-daub]], roofed with turf or thatch. There would be a single room for living space, with one end cordoned-off for animals.

In 1650, there were 19 tenants.<ref name=psns/>\n\nEarly in the 19th century, the homes at Pitmiddle were rebuilt in stone, seemingly on the site of their timber predecessors. They were single storey and thatched. The floors were stone flagged and the fireplaces were built into the gables. The houses were divided into two rooms by box beds. The kitchen fireplace had hooks for kettles and pans. Ashes were kept back by a piece of iron. Around the fireplace was a fender, with a fender stool. The 1861 census showed that all households had two rooms with windows, except John Soutar's farmhouse, which had three. By 1891, there were three families each living in a cottage with three rooms with windows and two families with only one such room, the rest still having two such rooms. Attached to the houses were wooden sheds, [[byre]]s and small gardens.

The demand for beer prompted the first Dutch governor, Jan van Riebeeck, to establish a brewery at the Fort (later replaced by the Castle in central Cape Town) as early as 1658 - beating the first wine production by six months. In the same year, Pieter Visagie brewed the first beer from the waters of the Liesbeeck River. Over the next 200 years, brewing made its mark in the Cape and beyond. Noted brewers of the time included Cloete at the Newlands Brewery; Ohlsson at the Anneberg Brewery; [[Jacob Letterstedt]] at Mariendahl Brewery - also in Newlands: Hiddingh at Cannon Brewery; Martienssen at the Salt River Brewery, and a second Cloete in Kloof Street.\n\nOne of the key figures in the story of Newlands, and in the annals of South African beer manufacturing history, was Swede Anders Ohlsson, who sailed for Africa, aged 23, in 1864. Initially, he imported Swedish goods and timbers, and developed an extensive trade network and a solid business empire. Then he turned to brewing, basing himself at Newlands, where he produced Lion Lager.\n\nIn 1955, the South African government introduced a heavy [[tax]] on [[beer]] products causing many consumers to switch to spirits.  However, the subsequent shock to the South African beer industry proved to be a blessing in disguise for SAB.  A year later, the company purchased its two main competitors, Ohlsson's and Chandlers Union Breweries, both of whom were struggling under the depressed demand for beer, and the group was renamed South African Breweries.\n\nAfter the acquisitions the new and larger SAB was able to rationalize operations, thereby reducing costs and increasing profitability. \nDonald Gordon's Liberty Life Strategic Investments (LIBSIL), which was associated with JSE-listed financial services and property holding company Liberty Holdings, maintained a large stake in the company for most of the 1990s.\nBy 1998, SAB commanded approximately 98 per cent share of the South African beer market and was considered one of the lowest cost producers of beer in the world.\n\nIn 1999, after listing on the London Stock Exchange to raise capital for acquisitions, the group purchased the [[Miller Brewing Company]] in North America from the [[Altria Group]] in 2002, and changed its name to [[SABMiller]].\n\nWithin South Africa, SAB distributes beer through its extensive network, augmented by a fleet of independent truck drivers (called owner-drivers) comprising mainly former employees, many of whom had received help from the group to start their own businesses. SAB has invested billions of rands in this owner-driver project since inception.\n\nAlthough several international brewers, such as the UK's Whitbread, had tried to enter the South African market, all had thus far failed to gain significant market share. From time to time, new startups also tried to challenge SAB's monopoly, but these had either gone out of business, or been acquired by SAB. A case in point was National Sorghum Breweries (NSB), \"a black business consortium\" founded in 1990, and the first new player in the beer industry in more than 10 years. \"SAB\u2019s supremacy is under threat,\" observers said, and some thought that within a few years NSB could achieve 10 per cent market share.  Instead, the company ran into financial difficulties and failed to gain any significant share of the market.\n\nThis does not mean that SAB's position could never be threatened. In 2004, a new company was established in South Africa known as brandhouse through a joint venture of Diageo, Heineken and Namibian Breweries. brandhouse started marketing, selling and distributing some of the world's top premium brands such as Heineken and Windhoek and in March 2007, the 40-year agreement between SABMiller plc and Heineken N.V. which allowed SAB Ltd to brew and distribute Amstel Lager in South Africa, was terminated, sparking a new era of competition for the industry. At the same time, Heineken announced its intention to build its own brewery in South Africa. \nSAB Ltd launched a new premium brand, Hansa Marzen Gold shortly thereafter and continued its expansion into premium brands with the launch of Dutch heritage beer, Grolsch, following SABMiller's acquisition of Koninklijke Grolsch N.V. in early 2008. Dreher Premium Lager was launched in South Africa the same year, and the company has made a number of innovations in the spirit cooler and apple-ale categories in recent years.\n\nOn October 2016, Anheuser-Busch InBev acquired the entire SABMiller company which then became a business division of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV and ceased trading on the worldwide stock markets.<ref name=\"auto1\"/><ref name=\"auto2\"/> As a result, South African Breweries and Carlton & United are now owned by Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV.<ref>{{cite news |last=Carter |first=Bridget |date=2 December 2015 |title=AB Inbev and Asahi held Foster\u2019s talks |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/dataroom/ab-inbev-and-asahi-held-fosters-talks/news-story/d0caaefdadb1415dcdb95a30a864bb35 |newspaper=The Australian |location= |access-date=3 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n===List of breweries===\n*Alrode Brewery, [[Gauteng]], {{coord|26|18|48.5|S|28|08|11.2|E|display=inline}}\n*Chamdor Brewery, [[Gauteng]], {{coord|26|09|12.2|S|27|47|40.3|E|display=inline}}\n*Ibhayi Brewery, [[Eastern Cape]], {{coord|33|50|15.8|S|25|32|30.9|E|display=inline}}\n*Newlands Brewery, [[Western Cape]], {{coord|33|58|23.5|S|18|27|56.9|E|display=inline}}\n*Polokwane Brewery, [[Limpopo]], {{coord|23|51|50.0|S|29|28|21.1|E|display=inline}}\n*Prospecton Brewery, [[KwaZulu-Natal]], {{coord|29|59|29.2|S|30|55|42.5|E|display=inline}}\n*Rosslyn Brewery, [[North West (South African province)|North West]], {{coord|25|37|26.0|S|28|05|23.9|E|display=inline}}\n\n===Soft drinks===\nIn 1925, SAB expanded into other beverages after purchasing a large share in [[Schweppes]] (soft drinks). In 1960, the group purchased a controlling interest in Stellenbosch Farmer's Winery, which, along with Distillers Corporation,  contributed R98 million to group earnings in 1997.\n\n1997, SAB subsidiary, Amalgamated Beverage Industries, purchased another [[Coca-Cola]] bottler, Suncrush, thereby doubling market share to approximately 60 per cent of South African soft drinks. [[PepsiCo]], SAB's only competitor, withdrew from the market in 1997 resulting in the liquidation of Pepsi franchisees. Pepsi, however, re-entered the South African market in 2006.\n\nIn December 2004, SAB Ltd acquired 100% of Amalgamated Beverage Industries Limited (ABI), which became the soft drink division of SAB Ltd, and the largest beverage company in South Africa was created.\n\n===Plate glass===\nIn 1917, the group began to venture into unrelated businesses when it agreed to take over a failed glass manufacturer, Union Glass, to counter the acute shortage of bottles during [[World War I]]. In 1954, Union Glass merged with Consolidated Glassworks and this business was sold off in 1960 to [[Anglovaal|Anglovaal Industries]]. The company became an important player in international glass manufacturing when it acquired the Plate Glass Group in 1992.\n\nThe Plate Glass Group traced its roots to a British immigrant and entrepreneur who, in 1897, established a plate glass manufacturing operation in [[Cape Town]], South Africa. Eventually the company became a leading producer of safety and bullet-proof glass for automobiles. In 1987 the company launched a new subsidiary in the United States in partnership with SAB and Anglo American. When Glass medic, a US-based windshield repair and replacement company, was acquired in 1990, the South African parent company merged the subsidiaries under the name Belron International. Belron became a base from which to launch further acquisitions. When SAB purchased Plate Glass in 1992, it was renamed Shatterprufe Limited.\n\nBelron had by 1998 become the world's leading producer of automotive replacement glass, with some 1,865 retail outlets in North America, Europe, Australia, and [[Brazil]]. Growth had come mainly through acquisitions. In 1997, Belron acquired several leading brands, including Standard Autoglass in Canada, thereby becoming \"the largest player in the North American Markets.\" Worldwide market share was on the order of 18%, and SAB envisioned further expansion in the coming years:\n\nIn Europe, Belron was opening an average of 12 new outlets per month. While sales had increased by five per cent in 1997, earnings had declined eight per cent to R255 million as a result of the borrowing costs associated with new acquisitions and expansion.\n\nRecognising the need to enhance long-term shareholder value, in 1997 SAB returned to its core beverage business, locally and internationally, selling off or closing non-core operations over the next few years. Amongst these was the Plate Glass business.\n\n===Entertainment and hospitality===\nAlthough SAB (then called Castle Breweries) had established the first pub in South Africa in 1896, it did not begin to invest heavily in service industries until 1949 when an aggressive expansion thrust saw some \u00a34.5 million invested in hotels and pubs, as well as additional brewing facilities.\n\nIn 1969, these interests were merged with a hotel chain owned by [[Sol Kerzner]], to form a separate subsidiary known as Southern Sun Hotels. Kerzner remained with Southern Sun as its managing director for several years thereafter. In 1983 Kerzner left SAB, but remained a significant shareholder in the company.\n\nSouthern Sun eventually grew to become the leading hotel chain in South Africa, with franchises awarded by [[Holiday Inn]] and Inter-continental Hotels. By 1998, this subsidiary owned 74 hotels with 12,200 rooms, or about 22 per cent of industry capacity.  Southern Sun also maintained a minority interest in an [[eco-tourism]] company.\n\nDevelopment of new hotels depended on securing licences from the government, \"as the state still owned large tracts of land in both urban and rural areas.\" Suitable locations for hotel and resort development were very limited, and local government officials often did not have the training and expertise needed to make informed decisions about the granting of such licences. Resulting delays resulted in significant costs.\n\nSeveral international hotel chains decided to enter South Africa after the lifting of economic sanctions. By 1998, numerous hotels were under construction by [[Hyatt]], [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts|Sheraton]], [[Howard Johnson's]], [[Days Inn]], [[Hilton Hotels|Hilton]], [[Best Western]], Concorde (France), Le Meridian (France), and Relais de Chateau (France), among others. Most new hotel development was in the executive and luxury segments of the market. In less than four years, industry-wide capacity had more than doubled, and as a result, the hotel industry began to experience significant over-supply. Combined with a weak currency, this translated into some of the lowest room rates in the world.\n\nAlthough escalating levels of violent crime  had been a serious constraint for South African tourism, Southern Sun had been able to maintain an average occupancy above 70%. In 1997, hotel earnings increased by 16% over the previous year to contribute R182 million to group earnings.\n\nThe government introduced the National [[Gambling]] Act in 1996, which allowed for up to 40 casino licenses to be issued to \"financially competent operators.\" In 1997, SAB entered into a joint-venture with Tsogo Sun Gaming and Entertainment to establish up to eight casino resorts to be completed as early as 2000. Monte Casino was the first of these developments to be completed at an expected construction cost of $US250 million.\n\nThe most notable black empowerment transaction facilitated by SAB was Tsogo Investments in early 2003. The transaction, which had an implied value of approximately R1.9-billion, meant that empowerment group Tsogo Investments acquired control of Southern Sun Hotels, then the largest hotel group in southern Africa as well as Tsogo Sun, a leading casino operator in South Africa.\n\n===Other manufacturing and retail===\nFurther diversification came in 1967 with the establishment of a new subsidiary known as Food Corporation (coffee, tea, and food products). An even larger diversification push was undertaken in the 1970s and 1980s, when the SAB group of companies purchased or established numerous unrelated operations including grocers (OK Bazaars), furniture factories and stores (Associated Furniture Company), shoe factories and stores (Shoecorp), and clothing stores (Scotts Stores and Edgars Fashion Group). In 1996, more than 20% of SAB's workforce was employed in these companies.\n\nChanges in consumer preferences towards less expensive goods had a negative effect on the premium retail market in the mid-1990s. SAB off-loaded the OK Bazaar grocery chain in 1997 for one rand, after losing nearly R20 million per month.  And at the beginning of 1998, the Clothing and Footwear, as well as the furniture divisions were also sold.  Later SAB also sold its 21% minority stake in Edgars Fashion Group in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200407080270.html|title=South Africa: Investors Gulp Down SABmiller's Edcon Stake|first=Rob|last=Rose|date=8 July 2004|accessdate=21 December 2017|website=AllAfrica.com}}</ref>\n\nSAB no longer holds any manufacturing or retail assets.\n\n===International expansion===\nThe company's earliest international venture was in 1910 when it founded Rhodesian Breweries in Southern Rhodesia, now [[Zimbabwe]]. This subsidiary spearheaded SAB's initial international expansion efforts, having established new breweries in Northern Rhodesia, now [[Zambia]] and [[Bulawayo]], Southern Rhodesia, in the early 1950s. Further international expansion came in the 1970s and 1980s with the establishment of breweries in Botswana, Angola, and the buying of ''Compa\u00f1\u00eda Cervezera de Canarias'' of the [[Canary Islands]]. Nevertheless, prior to 1990, SAB remained primarily focused on domestic opportunities.\n\nIn 1994, SAB was invited to revitalise the beer industry in Tanzania, a joint venture with that country's government in [[Tanzania Breweries Limited]], and to re-enter the beer markets of Zambia, Mozambique and, later, Angola. This followed  one of its first foreign investments into  the Canary Islands. Expansion continued into Africa in the 1990s and on other continents into Hungary (1993), China (1995), Romania, Poland (1995\u201396), Slovakia (1997), and Russia (1998), the Czech Republic (1999), India (2000) and Central America in 2001.\n\nThe group's expansion into Asia started with its 1995 negotiation of joint control of the second-largest brewery in mainland China with China Resources, a privatisation arm of the government of the People's Republic of China. Further investments included those in the Harbin Brewery Group and the Fuyang City Snowland Brewery.  In 2000 SAB plc entered the Indian market where it has subsequently increased its commitment.\n\nBy 2001, turnover from SAB plc's international operations accounted for 42% of group turnover. The same year, a pan-African strategic alliance with the Castel group offered the opportunity to invest in promising new African markets and the benefits of scale economies.\n\nInvolvement in Central and South America started in 2001 with the acquisition of Honduran and Salvadoran breweries.  This was followed four years later by the purchase of a major holding in Grupo Empresarial Bavaria, South America's second largest brewer.\n\nOne of its largest transactions was with the Miller Brewing Company in the US in 2002, whereupon the listed company changed its name to [[SABMiller]] plc.\n\nBy the end of March 2009, [[SABMiller]] produced global lager volumes of 210 million hectolitres, with total group revenues of US$25,302 million.\n\nOn 10 October 2016, [[Anheuser-Busch InBev]] acquired SABMiller for \u00a369 billion.<ref name=inbevmerger/> The arrangement had been approved by shareholders of both companies on 28 September 2016, and the deal closed on 10 October 2016.<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref name=\"Brown\"/> The acquisition, subsequently referred to as a merger in the news media, ended the corporate use of the name SABMiller.

The case was the result of an investigation into allegations related to SAB's distribution system and pricing activities between 2004 and 2007, with the allegations having been referred to the Competition Tribunal in 2007.\n\nThroughout the trial, the company maintained that none of its practices were in breach of the law and that it had not engaged in any anti-competitive behaviour. It note that \u201cSAB has structured its business to serve retailers and consumers and strongly believes that all businesses have the right to distribute their products in the manner that best serves their needs\u2026\u201d\n\nThe case was in the public domain for several years, having been referred to the Competition Tribunal in 2007 by the Competition Commission after a three-year investigation between 2004 and 2007. The original complaint lodged by Big Daddy's head Nico Pitsiladis with the Competition Commission alleged that SAB charged the Big Daddy's group as a wholesaler the same price as the company charged to retailers, thereby preventing Big Daddy's from earning a fair margin on its sales to retail.\n\nThe case that was presented by the Competition Commission before the Competition Tribunal related to SAB's distribution system; an alleged practice of minimum resale price maintenance; an allegation of price discrimination and broad, diffuse allegations relating to abuse of dominance. The abuse of dominance allegations were previously separated from the \u201cdistribution\u201d case and may proceed separately although the Commission has taken no further steps on this part of the case.\n\nSAB applied in 2011 to have the case dismissed, arguing that the case presented to the Tribunal was not the same as the original complaint laid by the Big Daddy's group in 2004. This was upheld by the Tribunal in April 2011.\n\nFollowing the Tribunal's dismissal of the case in April 2011, the Competition Commission applied to the Constitutional Court for direct access to the Constitutional Court, bypassing both the Competition Appeal Court and the Supreme Court of Appeal. In December 2011, the Constitutional Court handed down a decision in which it dismissed, with costs, the Competition Commission's direct access application.\n\nThe Commission subsequently filed an appeal with the Competition Appeal Court, which was heard on 13 September 2012. In November 2012, the Competition Appeal Court announced it had upheld the Commission's appeal and set aside the Tribunal's ruling. This resulted in the resumption of the Commission's case against SAB, which was heard before the Tribunal in July and August 2013.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*\"Bass Ginsber and South African Breweries,\" ''Business China'', 1 September 1997.\n*\"Blackmailer's bluff called,\" ''Financial Mail'', 8 August 1998.\n*\"Cagey SAB finally sees the writing on the wall on unbundling,\" ''Business Times'', 29 March 1998.\n*\"Is the Worst Over for South Africa?\" ''African Business'', December 1998.\n*\"Lion of Africa, Brewer to the People,\" ''[[The Economist]]'', 9 September 1995.\n*\"No Small Beer From This SA Giant,\" ''Accountancy'', November 1997\n*''SAB Annual Report'', 1998.\n*\"SAB flat as Johnnic brew confusion,\" ''Finance Week'', 20 November 1998.\n*\"Shoprite Buys Ailing OK Bazaars For R1,\" ''The Cape Argus'', 4 November 1997.\n*\"South Africa - Consular Information Sheet\", [[United States Department of State|US State Department]], 15 October 1998.\n*\"South African Breweries,\" SG Equity Research, 25 February 1999.\n*\"South Africa\u2019s Hotel Industry,\" ''Cornell Hotel and Restaurant Administration Quarterly'', February 1999.\n*\"We\u2019ll Double in a Decade,\" ''[[Money (magazine)|Money]]'', July 1994.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.sab.co.za/ SA Breweries]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20140523230217/http://www.sabstories.co.za/ SAB Stories: CSR & SA Beer Culture Official Website]\n*[https://dispense.co.za Specialised Dispense Systems]\n*[http://www.carlingblacklabel.co.za Carling Black Label]\n*[https://www.castlelager.co.za Castle Lager]\n*[https://www.castlelite.co.za Castle Lite]\n*[https://www.castlemilkstout.co.za Castle Milk Stout]\n*[https://addsomeflavour.co.za Flying Fish]\n*[https://www.hansapilsener.co.za Hansa Pilsener]\n*[https://www.hansagoldencrisp.co.za Hansa Golden Crisp]\n*[https://www.brutalfruit.co.za Brutal Fruit]\n*[https://www.redds.co.za Redd's]\n*[https://www.beliberado.com Beliberado]\n*[https://www.budweiser.co.za Budweiser South Africa]\n*[https://newlandsbrew.co.za New Lands Brew]\n\n{{SABMiller}}\n\n[[Category:Beer in South Africa]]\n[[Category:Defunct breweries]]\n[[Category:Defunct companies of South Africa]]\n[[Category:Manufacturing companies based in Johannesburg]]\n[[Category:Food and drink companies established in 1895]]\n[[Category:1895 establishments in South Africa]]\n[[Category:1895 in the South African Republic]]\n[[Category:Establishments in the South African Republic]]\n[[Category:Breweries of Africa]]\n[[Category:SABMiller]]\n", "text_old": "{{Main|Anheuser-Busch InBev}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2012}}\n{{Use South African English|date=May 2012}}\n{{Infobox company\n| name             = The South African Breweries Limited\n| logo             = [[File:SAB logo.png|150px]]\n| type             = [[Subsidiary]]\n| predecessor      = \n| successor        = \n| foundation       = 1895 ([[Johannesburg]])\n| founder          = \n| defunct          = \n| location_city    = Johannesburg\n| location_country = South Africa\n| locations        = \n| area_served      = [[Southern Africa]]\n| industry         = [[Fast moving consumer goods|Consumer goods]]\n| products         = [[Beer]], [[soft drink]]s\n| production       = \n| revenue          = \n| owner            = \n| num_employees    = Approximately 9,400<ref name=corpbro>{{cite web|url=http://www.sablimited.co.za/sablimited/action/media/downloadFile?media_fileid=791|title=Corporate Brochure|accessdate=5 December 2011|publisher=The South African Breweries Ltd|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110912014624/http://www.sablimited.co.za/sablimited/action/media/downloadFile?media_fileid=791|archivedate=12 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n| divisions        = \n| subsid           = \n| parent           =  [[Anheuser-Busch InBev]] SA/NV\n| homepage         =  [http://www.sab.co.za/ SA Breweries]\n| footnotes        = \n| intl             = \n}}\n\n'''South African Breweries''' (officially '''The South African Breweries Limited''', informally '''SAB''') is a major [[brewery]] headquartered in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa and was a wholly owned subsidiary of [[SABMiller]] until its interests were sold to [[Anheuser-Busch InBev]] on 10 October 2016.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2007/03/13/uk-sabmiller-amstel-idUKL1361162120070313|title=SABMiller says Heineken calls time on Amstel licence|accessdate=5 December 2011|publisher=Reuters|date=13 March 2007 }}</ref> South African Breweries is now a direct subsidiary of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=874078 |title=Company Overview of SABMiller Limited |author=<!--Staff writer(s);

The demand for beer prompted the first Dutch governor, Jan van Riebeeck, to establish a brewery at the Fort (later replaced by the Castle in central Cape Town) as early as 1658 - beating the first wine production by six months. In the same year, Pieter Visagie brewed the first beer from the waters of the Liesbeeck River. Over the next 200 years, brewing made its mark in the Cape and beyond. Noted brewers of the time included Cloete at the Newlands Brewery; Ohlsson at the Anneberg Brewery; [[Jacob Letterstedt]] at Mariendahl Brewery - also in Newlands: Hiddingh at Cannon Brewery; Martienssen at the Salt River Brewery, and a second Cloete in Kloof Street.\n\nOne of the key figures in the story of Newlands, and in the annals of South African beer manufacturing history, was Swede Anders Ohlsson, who sailed for Africa, aged 23, in 1864. Initially, he imported Swedish goods and timbers, and developed an extensive trade network and a solid business empire. Then he turned to brewing, basing himself at Newlands, where he produced Lion Lager.\n\nIn 1955, the South African government introduced a heavy [[tax]] on [[beer]] products causing many consumers to switch to spirits.  However, the subsequent shock to the South African beer industry proved to be a blessing in disguise for SAB.  A year later, the company purchased its two main competitors, Ohlsson's and Chandlers Union Breweries, both of whom were struggling under the depressed demand for beer, and the group was renamed South African Breweries.\n\nAfter the acquisitions the new and larger SAB was able to rationalize operations, thereby reducing costs and increasing profitability. \nDonald Gordon's Liberty Life Strategic Investments (LIBSIL), which was associated with JSE-listed financial services and property holding company Liberty Holdings, maintained a large stake in the company for most of the 1990s.\nBy 1998, SAB commanded approximately 98 per cent share of the South African beer market and was considered one of the lowest cost producers of beer in the world.\n\nIn 1999, after listing on the London Stock Exchange to raise capital for acquisitions, the group purchased the [[Miller Brewing Company]] in North America from the [[Altria Group]] in 2002, and changed its name to [[SABMiller]].\n\nWithin South Africa, SAB distributes beer through its extensive network, augmented by a fleet of independent truck drivers (called owner-drivers) comprising mainly former employees, many of whom had received help from the group to start their own businesses. SAB has invested billions of rands in this owner-driver project since inception.\n\nAlthough several international brewers, such as the UK's Whitbread, had tried to enter the South African market, all had thus far failed to gain significant market share. From time to time, new startups also tried to challenge SAB's monopoly, but these had either gone out of business, or been acquired by SAB. A case in point was National Sorghum Breweries (NSB), \"a black business consortium\" founded in 1990, and the first new player in the beer industry in more than 10 years. \"SAB\u2019s supremacy is under threat,\" observers said, and some thought that within a few years NSB could achieve 10 per cent market share.  Instead, the company ran into financial difficulties and failed to gain any significant share of the market.\n\nThis does not mean that SAB's position could never be threatened. In 2004, a new company was established in South Africa known as brandhouse through a joint venture of Diageo, Heineken and Namibian Breweries. brandhouse started marketing, selling and distributing some of the world's top premium brands such as Heineken and Windhoek and in March 2007, the 40-year agreement between SABMiller plc and Heineken N.V. which allowed SAB Ltd to brew and distribute Amstel Lager in South Africa, was terminated, sparking a new era of competition for the industry. At the same time, Heineken announced its intention to build its own brewery in South Africa. \nSAB Ltd launched a new premium brand, Hansa Marzen Gold shortly thereafter and continued its expansion into premium brands with the launch of Dutch heritage beer, Grolsch, following SABMiller's acquisition of Koninklijke Grolsch N.V. in early 2008. Dreher Premium Lager was launched in South Africa the same year, and the company has made a number of innovations in the spirit cooler and apple-ale categories in recent years.\n\nOn October 2016, Anheuser-Busch InBev acquired the entire SABMiller company which then became a business division of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV and ceased trading on the worldwide stock markets.<ref name=\"auto1\"/><ref name=\"auto2\"/> As a result, South African Breweries and Carlton & United are now owned by Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV.<ref>{{cite news |last=Carter |first=Bridget |date=2 December 2015 |title=AB Inbev and Asahi held Foster\u2019s talks |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/dataroom/ab-inbev-and-asahi-held-fosters-talks/news-story/d0caaefdadb1415dcdb95a30a864bb35 |newspaper=The Australian |location= |access-date=3 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n===List of breweries===\n*Alrode Brewery, [[Gauteng]], {{coord|26|18|48.5|S|28|08|11.2|E|display=inline}}\n*Chamdor Brewery, [[Gauteng]], {{coord|26|09|12.2|S|27|47|40.3|E|display=inline}}\n*Ibhayi Brewery, [[Eastern Cape]], {{coord|33|50|15.8|S|25|32|30.9|E|display=inline}}\n*Newlands Brewery, [[Western Cape]], {{coord|33|58|23.5|S|18|27|56.9|E|display=inline}}\n*Polokwane Brewery, [[Limpopo]], {{coord|23|51|50.0|S|29|28|21.1|E|display=inline}}\n*Prospecton Brewery, [[KwaZulu-Natal]], {{coord|29|59|29.2|S|30|55|42.5|E|display=inline}}\n*Rosslyn Brewery, [[North West (South African province)|North West]], {{coord|25|37|26.0|S|28|05|23.9|E|display=inline}}\n\n===Soft drinks===\nIn 1925, SAB expanded into other beverages after purchasing a large share in [[Schweppes]] (soft drinks). In 1960, the group purchased a controlling interest in Stellenbosch Farmer's Winery, which, along with Distillers Corporation,  contributed R98 million to group earnings in 1997.\n\n1997, SAB subsidiary, Amalgamated Beverage Industries, purchased another [[Coca-Cola]] bottler, Suncrush, thereby doubling market share to approximately 60 per cent of South African soft drinks. [[PepsiCo]], SAB's only competitor, withdrew from the market in 1997 resulting in the liquidation of Pepsi franchisees. Pepsi, however, re-entered the South African market in 2006.\n\nIn December 2004, SAB Ltd acquired 100% of Amalgamated Beverage Industries Limited (ABI), which became the soft drink division of SAB Ltd, and the largest beverage company in South Africa was created.\n\n===Plate glass===\nIn 1917, the group began to venture into unrelated businesses when it agreed to take over a failed glass manufacturer, Union Glass, to counter the acute shortage of bottles during [[World War I]]. In 1954, Union Glass merged with Consolidated Glassworks and this business was sold off in 1960 to [[Anglovaal|Anglovaal Industries]]. The company became an important player in international glass manufacturing when it acquired the Plate Glass Group in 1992.\n\nThe Plate Glass Group traced its roots to a British immigrant and entrepreneur who, in 1897, established a plate glass manufacturing operation in [[Cape Town]], South Africa. Eventually the company became a leading producer of safety and bullet-proof glass for automobiles. In 1987 the company launched a new subsidiary in the United States in partnership with SAB and Anglo American. When Glass medic, a US-based windshield repair and replacement company, was acquired in 1990, the South African parent company merged the subsidiaries under the name Belron International. Belron became a base from which to launch further acquisitions. When SAB purchased Plate Glass in 1992, it was renamed Shatterprufe Limited.\n\nBelron had by 1998 become the world's leading producer of automotive replacement glass, with some 1,865 retail outlets in North America, Europe, Australia, and [[Brazil]]. Growth had come mainly through acquisitions. In 1997, Belron acquired several leading brands, including Standard Autoglass in Canada, thereby becoming \"the largest player in the North American Markets.\" Worldwide market share was on the order of 18%, and SAB envisioned further expansion in the coming years:\n\nIn Europe, Belron was opening an average of 12 new outlets per month. While sales had increased by five per cent in 1997, earnings had declined eight per cent to R255 million as a result of the borrowing costs associated with new acquisitions and expansion.\n\nRecognising the need to enhance long-term shareholder value, in 1997 SAB returned to its core beverage business, locally and internationally, selling off or closing non-core operations over the next few years. Amongst these was the Plate Glass business.\n\n===Entertainment and hospitality===\nAlthough SAB (then called Castle Breweries) had established the first pub in South Africa in 1896, it did not begin to invest heavily in service industries until 1949 when an aggressive expansion thrust saw some \u00a34.5 million invested in hotels and pubs, as well as additional brewing facilities.\n\nIn 1969, these interests were merged with a hotel chain owned by [[Sol Kerzner]], to form a separate subsidiary known as Southern Sun Hotels. Kerzner remained with Southern Sun as its managing director for several years thereafter. In 1983 Kerzner left SAB, but remained a significant shareholder in the company.\n\nSouthern Sun eventually grew to become the leading hotel chain in South Africa, with franchises awarded by [[Holiday Inn]] and Inter-continental Hotels. By 1998, this subsidiary owned 74 hotels with 12,200 rooms, or about 22 per cent of industry capacity.  Southern Sun also maintained a minority interest in an [[eco-tourism]] company.\n\nDevelopment of new hotels depended on securing licences from the government, \"as the state still owned large tracts of land in both urban and rural areas.\" Suitable locations for hotel and resort development were very limited, and local government officials often did not have the training and expertise needed to make informed decisions about the granting of such licences. Resulting delays resulted in significant costs.\n\nSeveral international hotel chains decided to enter South Africa after the lifting of economic sanctions. By 1998, numerous hotels were under construction by [[Hyatt]], [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts|Sheraton]], [[Howard Johnson's]], [[Days Inn]], [[Hilton Hotels|Hilton]], [[Best Western]], Concorde (France), Le Meridian (France), and Relais de Chateau (France), among others. Most new hotel development was in the executive and luxury segments of the market. In less than four years, industry-wide capacity had more than doubled, and as a result, the hotel industry began to experience significant over-supply. Combined with a weak currency, this translated into some of the lowest room rates in the world.\n\nAlthough escalating levels of violent crime  had been a serious constraint for South African tourism, Southern Sun had been able to maintain an average occupancy above 70%. In 1997, hotel earnings increased by 16% over the previous year to contribute R182 million to group earnings.\n\nThe government introduced the National [[Gambling]] Act in 1996, which allowed for up to 40 casino licenses to be issued to \"financially competent operators.\" In 1997, SAB entered into a joint-venture with Tsogo Sun Gaming and Entertainment to establish up to eight casino resorts to be completed as early as 2000. Monte Casino was the first of these developments to be completed at an expected construction cost of $US250 million.\n\nThe most notable black empowerment transaction facilitated by SAB was Tsogo Investments in early 2003. The transaction, which had an implied value of approximately R1.9-billion, meant that empowerment group Tsogo Investments acquired control of Southern Sun Hotels, then the largest hotel group in southern Africa as well as Tsogo Sun, a leading casino operator in South Africa.\n\n===Other manufacturing and retail===\nFurther diversification came in 1967 with the establishment of a new subsidiary known as Food Corporation (coffee, tea, and food products). An even larger diversification push was undertaken in the 1970s and 1980s, when the SAB group of companies purchased or established numerous unrelated operations including grocers (OK Bazaars), furniture factories and stores (Associated Furniture Company), shoe factories and stores (Shoecorp), and clothing stores (Scotts Stores and Edgars Fashion Group). In 1996, more than 20% of SAB's workforce was employed in these companies.\n\nChanges in consumer preferences towards less expensive goods had a negative effect on the premium retail market in the mid-1990s. SAB off-loaded the OK Bazaar grocery chain in 1997 for one rand, after losing nearly R20 million per month.  And at the beginning of 1998, the Clothing and Footwear, as well as the furniture divisions were also sold.  Later SAB also sold its 21% minority stake in Edgars Fashion Group in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200407080270.html|title=South Africa: Investors Gulp Down SABmiller's Edcon Stake|first=Rob|last=Rose|date=8 July 2004|accessdate=21 December 2017|website=AllAfrica.com}}</ref>\n\nSAB no longer holds any manufacturing or retail assets.\n\n===International expansion===\nThe company's earliest international venture was in 1910 when it founded Rhodesian Breweries in Southern Rhodesia, now [[Zimbabwe]]. This subsidiary spearheaded SAB's initial international expansion efforts, having established new breweries in Northern Rhodesia, now [[Zambia]] and [[Bulawayo]], Southern Rhodesia, in the early 1950s. Further international expansion came in the 1970s and 1980s with the establishment of breweries in Botswana, Angola, and the buying of ''Compa\u00f1\u00eda Cervezera de Canarias'' of the [[Canary Islands]]. Nevertheless, prior to 1990, SAB remained primarily focused on domestic opportunities.\n\nIn 1994, SAB was invited to revitalise the beer industry in Tanzania, a joint venture with that country's government in [[Tanzania Breweries Limited]], and to re-enter the beer markets of Zambia, Mozambique and, later, Angola. This followed  one of its first foreign investments into  the Canary Islands. Expansion continued into Africa in the 1990s and on other continents into Hungary (1993), China (1995), Romania, Poland (1995\u201396), Slovakia (1997), and Russia (1998), the Czech Republic (1999), India (2000) and Central America in 2001.\n\nThe group's expansion into Asia started with its 1995 negotiation of joint control of the second-largest brewery in mainland China with China Resources, a privatisation arm of the government of the People's Republic of China. Further investments included those in the Harbin Brewery Group and the Fuyang City Snowland Brewery.  In 2000 SAB plc entered the Indian market where it has subsequently increased its commitment.\n\nBy 2001, turnover from SAB plc's international operations accounted for 42% of group turnover. The same year, a pan-African strategic alliance with the Castel group offered the opportunity to invest in promising new African markets and the benefits of scale economies.\n\nInvolvement in Central and South America started in 2001 with the acquisition of Honduran and Salvadoran breweries.  This was followed four years later by the purchase of a major holding in Grupo Empresarial Bavaria, South America's second largest brewer.\n\nOne of its largest transactions was with the Miller Brewing Company in the US in 2002, whereupon the listed company changed its name to [[SABMiller]] plc.\n\nBy the end of March 2009, [[SABMiller]] produced global lager volumes of 210 million hectolitres, with total group revenues of US$25,302 million.\n\nOn 10 October 2016, [[Anheuser-Busch InBev]] acquired SABMiller for \u00a369 billion.<ref name=inbevmerger/> The arrangement had been approved by shareholders of both companies on 28 September 2016, and the deal closed on 10 October 2016.<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref name=\"Brown\"/> The acquisition, subsequently referred to as a merger in the news media, ended the corporate use of the name SABMiller.

The case was the result of an investigation into allegations related to SAB's distribution system and pricing activities between 2004 and 2007, with the allegations having been referred to the Competition Tribunal in 2007.\n\nThroughout the trial, the company maintained that none of its practices were in breach of the law and that it had not engaged in any anti-competitive behaviour. It note that \u201cSAB has structured its business to serve retailers and consumers and strongly believes that all businesses have the right to distribute their products in the manner that best serves their needs\u2026\u201d\n\nThe case was in the public domain for several years, having been referred to the Competition Tribunal in 2007 by the Competition Commission after a three-year investigation between 2004 and 2007. The original complaint lodged by Big Daddy's head Nico Pitsiladis with the Competition Commission alleged that SAB charged the Big Daddy's group as a wholesaler the same price as the company charged to retailers, thereby preventing Big Daddy's from earning a fair margin on its sales to retail.\n\nThe case that was presented by the Competition Commission before the Competition Tribunal related to SAB's distribution system; an alleged practice of minimum resale price maintenance; an allegation of price discrimination and broad, diffuse allegations relating to abuse of dominance. The abuse of dominance allegations were previously separated from the \u201cdistribution\u201d case and may proceed separately although the Commission has taken no further steps on this part of the case.\n\nSAB applied in 2011 to have the case dismissed, arguing that the case presented to the Tribunal was not the same as the original complaint laid by the Big Daddy's group in 2004. This was upheld by the Tribunal in April 2011.\n\nFollowing the Tribunal's dismissal of the case in April 2011, the Competition Commission applied to the Constitutional Court for direct access to the Constitutional Court, bypassing both the Competition Appeal Court and the Supreme Court of Appeal. In December 2011, the Constitutional Court handed down a decision in which it dismissed, with costs, the Competition Commission's direct access application.\n\nThe Commission subsequently filed an appeal with the Competition Appeal Court, which was heard on 13 September 2012. In November 2012, the Competition Appeal Court announced it had upheld the Commission's appeal and set aside the Tribunal's ruling. This resulted in the resumption of the Commission's case against SAB, which was heard before the Tribunal in July and August 2013.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*\"Bass Ginsber and South African Breweries,\" ''Business China'', 1 September 1997.\n*\"Blackmailer's bluff called,\" ''Financial Mail'', 8 August 1998.\n*\"Cagey SAB finally sees the writing on the wall on unbundling,\" ''Business Times'', 29 March 1998.\n*\"Is the Worst Over for South Africa?\" ''African Business'', December 1998.\n*\"Lion of Africa, Brewer to the People,\" ''[[The Economist]]'', 9 September 1995.\n*\"No Small Beer From This SA Giant,\" ''Accountancy'', November 1997\n*''SAB Annual Report'', 1998.\n*\"SAB flat as Johnnic brew confusion,\" ''Finance Week'', 20 November 1998.\n*\"Shoprite Buys Ailing OK Bazaars For R1,\" ''The Cape Argus'', 4 November 1997.\n*\"South Africa - Consular Information Sheet\", [[United States Department of State|US State Department]], 15 October 1998.\n*\"South African Breweries,\" SG Equity Research, 25 February 1999.\n*\"South Africa\u2019s Hotel Industry,\" ''Cornell Hotel and Restaurant Administration Quarterly'', February 1999.\n*\"We\u2019ll Double in a Decade,\" ''[[Money (magazine)|Money]]'', July 1994.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.sab.co.za/ SA Breweries]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20140523230217/http://www.sabstories.co.za/ SAB Stories: CSR & SA Beer Culture Official Website]\n*[https://dispense.co.za Specialised Dispense Systems]\n*[http://www.carlingblacklabel.co.za Carling Black Label]\n*[https://www.castlelager.co.za Castle Lager]\n*[https://www.castlelite.co.za Castle Lite]\n*[https://www.castlemilkstout.co.za Castle Milk Stout]\n*[https://addsomeflavour.co.za Flying Fish]\n*[https://www.hansapilsener.co.za Hansa Pilsener]\n*[https://www.hansagoldencrisp.co.za Hansa Golden Crisp]\n*[https://www.brutalfruit.co.za Brutal Fruit]\n*[https://www.redds.co.za Redd's]\n*[https://www.beliberado.com Beliberado]\n*[https://www.budweiser.co.za Budweiser South Africa]\n*[https://newlandsbrew.co.za New Lands Brew]\n\n{{SABMiller}}\n\n[[Category:Beer in South Africa]]\n[[Category:Defunct breweries]]\n[[Category:Defunct companies of South Africa]]\n[[Category:Manufacturing companies based in Johannesburg]]\n[[Category:Food and drink companies established in 1895]]\n[[Category:1895 establishments in South Africa]]\n[[Category:1895 in the South African Republic]]\n[[Category:Establishments in the South African Republic]]\n[[Category:Breweries of Africa]]\n[[Category:SABMiller]]\n", "name_user": "105.225.106.165", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_Breweries"}

They are known to operate primarily in the [[Western Cape]] prison of [[Pollsmoor Prison|Pollsmoor]], however it is believed that they are present in most South African prisons.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n==Origin==\n{{story|date=November 2012}}\nThe Numbers Gang was started in the late 1800s, supposedly to protect mineworkers. The origins of the gang remain sketchy at best. Amongst gang members, the likely apocryphal story of [[Nongoloza]] and Ngeleketshane is claimed as the gangs origin.\n\nThe Numbers Gang story holds that a man named Po became alarmed by the exploitation of miners in late 1800's South Africa. Allegedly Po befriends a young [[Zulu people|Zulu]] called [[Nongoloza]] who said he was on his way to the mines to look for work and Ngeleketshane, a member of the [[Pondo people|Pondo tribe]]. Po eventually recruits 15 young men. He teaches them a secret language and [[highway robbery]]. The men succeed in robbing travelers and colonial outposts of their goods. The gang chooses to change their habits to avoid being caught. They move from cave to cave and split themselves into two groups: Ngeleketshane with his seven men who rob by the day, and Nongoloza and his six men who rob by night. Po orders the two men to carve their daily [[outlaw]] activities on a nearby rock which is to serve as a diary.\n\nPo then orders the two men to visit a farm, owned by a Mr. Rabie, and to buy one of his bulls called Rooiland (Red Earth). Mr. Rabie is suspicious, and he refuses to sell the two men the bull. The two youths refuse to leave without carrying out their order, and proceed to stab the farmer with [[bayonet]]s and then steal the bull, and slaughter it for a feast.\n\nPo orders the men to take the hide of the bull and press it onto the diary rock until the words have been transferred from the rock to the hide. With two copies of the gang's way, Po explains the [[bandit]]s must follow the rules as they have been set out from the beginning. The two items are divided between the two men. Nongoloza receives the hide and Ngeleketshane receives the rock. The two are instructed to carry them wherever they go. The [[Rock (geology)|rock]], however, proves to be too awkward to carry and one day it is accidentally dropped down a hill. It splits into two pieces, one of which falls into a river. This leaves Ngeleketshane's gang with only half of the gang's laws.\n\nThe first conflict of the two gangs takes place because of this incident. The two gangs decide to embark on a joint expedition. Nongoloza says he is sick and decides to stay behind. He asks one of Ngeleketshane's soldiers, Magubane, to stay behind. Upon returning Ngeleketshane finds Nongoloza engaged in homosexual acts with Magubane. Enraged, Kilikijan challenges Nongoloza to a fight. Nongoloza replies that according to the hide sex between bandits is allowed as to avoid contact with women. Kilikijan retaliates by saying that he does not trust Nongoloza, believing he added this law to the hide after half his rock went missing. The two men commence fighting until they are both drenched in blood, and Po arrives to intervene.\n\nPo listens to both men's sides of the story. He then tells Ngeleketshane to travel to the mines to see if men were engaging in sex with one another. Ngeleketshane finds that this does indeed take place, but opinions remained divided as to whether this justified Nongoloza's act. This was to become the pivotal disagreement between the two gangs that persist to this day. Po had informed the men that at the entrance of his cave was an old [[assegai]], and if the two men found the tip of the assegai rusted, it would mean that Po had died. Due to the death of Po, a final decision on whether sexual intercourse between men was allowed never came to pass.\n\nThis prediction had come true and the two gangs decided to go their separate ways: Nongoloza's gang with its now eight men (which included Magubane, who he decided to take with him) and Kilikijan's gang with its seven. It is said that this is where the numbers \"27\" and \"28\" originated, with the number \"2\" symbolising the two leaders. The gangs agree that the day would still be divided between them as it had always been. The gangs continued to roam the countryside until they both ended up in Point Prison in [[Durban]].\n\nIt was at Point Prison that they encountered a group of six men, led by a man named Grey, who were franse (non-[[gangster]]s). The six men would sit in a circle and flip a single silver coin between them. Nongoloza demanded that the men hand over their possessions to him; he is refused. Later he is told by Ngeleketshane that these men were skilled [[smuggler]]s and [[gambler]]s who had helped him in his early days in prison.<ref>Van Onselen, New Babylon, New Nineveh, 368\u2013397.</ref>\n\nNongoloza decides to name the coin a \"''Spyker''\" (nail) while Ngeleketshane insists that they should call it a \"''Kroon''\" (crown). A fight broke out between Nongoloza and Ngeleketshane about the future of the gamblers. Ngeleketshane defended the gamblers against the 28's sexual appetites, which is what Nongoloza wanted them for.\n\nAfter many disagreements it was finally decided by Nongoloza that the new group would be called the \"26s\". This name was chosen because they had six men but also because Nongoloza wanted to indicate their inferior status. Nongoloza informed Ngeleketshane that he and his men would have to answer for the actions of the 26s.\n\nFinally the three camps were formed. The '''26s''' were responsible for gambling, smuggling and accruing wealth in general. The '''28s''' were the [[warrior]]s and responsible for fighting on behalf of all three groups, and the '''27s''' were the guardians of gang law and the peace keepers between all the gangs.\n\nNew rules and a strict [[code of conduct]] were drawn up. It was decided that when a gangster broke a rule, the blood of a warder or franse (non-gangster) must be spilled to set things right.\n\n==Numbers==\n\n=== 26s ===\nThe 26s' duty is to accumulate wealth for all the numbers.<ref>Haysom, N. (1981). Towards an understanding of prison gangs Institute of Criminology, University of Cape Town.</ref> The 26s have no private line and a [[Prison sexuality|wyfie]] may not join the gang. Although a member of the 26s may take a wyfie for himself, it is strictly against the laws as set out in the book of 26s.\n\nThe [[gang]] has a very specific hierarchy and is structured as follows:\n\n:{{Col-begin|width=60%}}\n{{Col-break}}\n;The Number Ones\n:(Top Structure)\n* Government Makwezie\n* General Number 1\n* Inspector Number 1\n* Doctor Number 1\n* Maballaan (clerk) Number 1\n* Prokureur (Lawyer) Number 1\n* Landdros Number 1 (magistrate)\n* Judge Number 1\n* Captain Number 1\n{{Col-break}}\n;The Number twos\n:(Secondary Structure)\n* General number 2\n* Inspector number 2\n* Doctor number 2\n* Maballaan number 2\n* Judge number 2\n* Captain number 2\n* Sergeant Major\n* Sergeant number 1\n* Sergeant number 33\n* The Heksman (guard)\n* Soldiers\n{{col-end}}\n\nIn the number 2s and the number 1s there is a number 1's and number 2's ''twelve point ring', for number 4's and 5's, but not 6's or 7's, who have an 11 point ring, unless theyre number 8's. ' which makes gang decisions according to their jurisdictions. Each rank has its own assigned office and duties which include [[training]] lower rank members in the duties and codes of the gang.<ref>Schurink, W. J. (1989). The world of the Wetslaners: an analysis of some organisational features in South African prisons. Acta Criminologica 2:2, 60\u201370.</ref>\n\nThe 26s have historically been considered{{who|date=November 2012}} an inferior gang and have lived in the shadow of the 28s; however in some prisons they have risen up against the 28s and controlled the prisons. (See \"general elections\", below)and in some prisons like westville 26 are ruling those prisons .\n\n===28s===\nThe 28s are the blood line of the gang.  the 28's are responsible for the fighting/war amongst the three gangs (26, 27 and 28). They are divided into two lines \u2013 the gold line and the silver line. Haysom's study (1981) on prison gangs is based on Supreme Court trial records and supplemented with some interviews with ex-offenders. Schurink's paper (1989) summarises the findings of a study on prison gangs commissioned by the Department of Correctional Services. For this study, in depth interviews were conducted with sixty prisoners, mainly coloured men serving in St Albans and Brandvlei prisons. Prisoners were also encouraged to write about their prison experiences providing a number of personal manuscripts.\n\nThe gold line are the warriors, the descendants of Nongoloza. They are for fighting the gang's battles.\n\nThe silver line are the female, and are the descendants of Magubane. They are considered to be the [[sex slave]]s of the gold line.\n\nThe emblem of the 28s is the Zulu shield, whose skin is made out of the legendary Rooiland cow's remains.\n\nIn the 28s it is important to prove your manhood and move up in the rankings. A member moves up the ranks through the stabbing or killing of rival gangs, [[prison guard]]s or disobedient members. Should a member stay in the lower ranks he will still be considered a woman and will be sexually abused until he proves his manhood.\n\n===Recruitment into the 28s===\nWhen a new prisoner is assigned a cell he will be introduced to the person in charge of that cell known as the \"cell cleaner\". The cell cleaner will welcome the new prisoner to the cell, and will either leave him alone for the evening, or will demand sex.\n\nThe new prisoners will be observed by a senior member of the gang known as \"die glas\" (the binoculars). The glas' job is to conduct gang business in ''die bos'' (the bush), the parts of the prison where the 28s are not active. The glas will then confront a potential new recruit and give him a riddle. How the new prisoner answers the riddle will determine which department of the gang he will fall under.\n\nThe glas will generally watch the way new members interact with other franse (non-gang members). He will watch how the new prisoner deals with conflict, the way he solves problems and the way he walks and talks. The glas then approaches the new prisoner and will say \"I am going to ask you a question. Think very carefully before answering.\" The glas will go on to say, \"It is raining. You are standing under an umbrella. I say to you I am getting wet; I may get sick. What are you going to do?\" The new inmate's answer will determine his future in the prison. If he should say \"I invite you to share my umbrella\" he would become a sex slave and would not become a member of the 28s. If he should say \"I will come out into the rain with you\" it means that the new inmate is saying that he is prepared to live like him; they are brothers and they will live and die together.\n\nAfter the glas is satisfied with the answer of the new inmate, he is given a task to become a member. This task could either be the fatal or non-fatal [[stabbing]] of another inmate or warden. The new recruit will be given a knife whose length is determined by another senior member of the gang known as the nyangi (the doctor). Should the gang want the stabbing to be fatal the nyangi will give the new recruit a longer blade, and a shorter one in the event the gang wants a non-lethal stabbing.\n\nOnce the stabbing has taken place all the gang members watching will shout \"Nangampela!<ref>\"Nangampela\" is an isiZulu word that means, literally, \"There it is, indeed!\"</ref> Die nommer is vol!\" (The number is complete).\n\nOn a Sunday, the \"day of rights\", his ceremony is performed. He is once again ordered to stand in the middle of the room; however this time he is surrounded by several people. The first person to approach him is the nyangi. The nyangi then takes a gold pipe and slaps it on the new recruit's right wrist, then takes a silver pipe and slaps it on the new recruit's left wrist. He then checks the recruit's pulse and declares either \"''Die man se pols klop twee keer per jaar''\" (This man's pulse beats twice a year) or \"''Die man se pols klop drie keer per jaar'''\" (This man's pulse beats three times a year). Should he mention that his pulse beats twice it would mean the new recruit is being recruited onto the silver line, if three times it means he is being recruited onto the gold line.\n\nThe gwenza (senior member) then places a handkerchief on the floor and slips a knife under it. He stands and says to the recruit: \"From today you are no longer a frans. You are a 28. You will never swear at your brother. You will never hurt your brother. You will never do anything that reflects badly on the camp. If you leave the camp, you leave by your own blood.\"\n\nThe landdros (magistrate) will then come forward and take out his green and white stamps and give the new member his approval. The landdros carries four stamps \u2013 white, green, red and black, which signify the four hooves on the Rooiland.\n\nThese stamps signify promotion. When a member of the silver line is promoted he takes out his green and white stamp; if the member is from the gold line he takes out the green and the red stamps. The black stamp is reserved for the death sentence.\n\nThe ending of the ceremony is signalled by the new recruit being marched out of the circle. The 28s then take the new recruit to the 26s and 27s.\n\nThe new recruit will then sleep alongside different members of the 28 gang and be told what his duties are. He will also begin to learn the history of Nongoloza and Kilikijan. It will only be a brief fragment of the story, for he is still too junior to hear the whole story.\n\nThe 40s are senior but inactive due to being too old or too injured for active duty. Another reason a person could be a mamboza is because his position has already being filled by another member. A prison cannot have two active nyangis for example, and if another nyangi is transferred from another prison he is considered dormant \u2013 he sleeps in the forties.\n\nThe mambozas begin to teach the new member to sabela (speak prison language). It is a long and gruelling process. The new member has to sabela all day and night with his blackboard (teacher). The first two months being a member of the number means that a new member is not allowed to receive visits, write letters or read books. They must focus on the number. If somebody learns too slowly the punishments are severe. New members can be stripped of all their clothes and thrown into an ice cold shower until they \"find the number\" (get it right).\n\nOne of the last things new members learn is about a position in the silver line held by a man named Mtjoetijies. This man is dead but his place in the hierarchy is left empty. Legend has it that Mtjoetijies was a translator, for Nongoloza who refused to speak the language of the white oppressor. Nongoloza grew increasingly wary about what Mtjoetijies was saying to the white officers, and decided to take action and kill him as a precaution. The position remains open as a reminder that the 28s do not negotiate with words, they negotiate with action.\n\nThis ritual, however, has now changed. The fundamental principles remain the same; however, in modern 28 law the man who trains you is now allowed also to have sex with you. This change came along because of the war between the silver and gold lines of the number.\n\n===The 28s War===\nIn the late '80s a decision was taken to stop bloodlines (no stabbing). The silver line complained that the gold line were now not doing their jobs. The gold line complained about the silver line being greedy with the food. In the days when the bloodlines were still open the gold line members had a very strict diet to follow as they were not allowed to get fat. They were not allowed to eat eggs for example and were never allowed sugar with the coffee and their porridge. All these items went to the silver lines instead. Upon the closing of the bloodlines the gold line demanded that they get the food they wanted since there was no longer a need to stay fit. The silver line refused, and thus the gold line declared war on the silver line.\n\nWithin months hostilities had ceased. The hospital beds were filled with soldiers from the 28 gang.\n\nThe gold line formally offered their surrender. The silver line then set out their terms. They closed down the gold line and vowed that it would never be opened again. They threw the soldiers out of their ranks and filled these ranks with silver line members. They then decreed that nobody would have to take blood to join the 28s again. They also changed the initiation rules: they stated that any person who wished to join the 28s had to have sex with their teacher.\n\nThe rule of the blood has, however, changed. Modern members are now expected both to kill upon order of their general as well as have sex with their teacher, they are also expected to know the \"Number\" to the extent that the new members would be waken up in the middle of the night and asked the \"Number\" if they get it wrong they would have to have sex with any fellow brother or be asked to kill an inmate.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Relationship between the numbers===\nThe two 28s are not allowed to speak directly to the 26s. They communicate through the 27s. In the event that the 28s have recruited a new member, the 28s will inform the 27s who then will inform the 26s. This is seen as a \"hands off\" warning to the other gangs.\n\n==Relationships with franse (non gang members)==\n{{Unref sect|date=September 2019}}\nThe numbers gangs refer to themselves as ndodas (men) and refer to non-gang members as franse. The frans is stripped of his juridical personhood. He is not seen as a human to the gangs.\n\nThe frans must submit everything he has to the ndodas, but the franse are protected from the numbers by being housed in different cells.\n\n===Relationship with warders===\nThe relationship between gang members and the warders is a complex and an uneasy one. Under the apartheid regime they feared the warders.  They knew that the warders would not be watched by human rights groups, so when there was a stabbing of an officer the warders would beat the gang members to within an inch of their lives.\n\nUnder the new system however the warders have become targets.  The numbers gang are well aware that the consequences of their actions will not result in a beating or the death penalty, and therefore new initiates are encouraged to stab a warden or even to attempt to take his eye out of the socket.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nOne of the most compelling messages that the numbers gang members like to send to the warders, is by holding up a mirror toward the warden.  This deviates from the traditional practice of holding up an image of an inmate.  The message the numbers are said to be sending is \"We are what you are. You are an army, we are an army. Where you have a head of the prison, we will have a judge. Where you have a head of a section, we will have a general. Whatever you do to us, we will do to you in turn.\"\n\n==The numbers network==\nOne notable feature of the numbers gang is that it is a nationwide brotherhood that is prevalent in every prison across South Africa.\n\nMembers that betray the gang are not safe in any South African prison, as the numbers control every prison in South Africa. The secretive nature of the gang makes their system of communicating to other prisons unknown. This is what makes them probably the most dangerous prison gang in the world.\n\n==General elections==\nTraditionally the 28 gang has been the dominant gang. This still holds true in prisons such as Pollsmoor prison. However the balance of power now varies from prison to prison over time. When one of the number gangs feels it can take control of the prison, they declare a \"general election\" in which an all out war is waged, often lasting up to two years until one gang is declared the \"ruling party\". Two famous cases of these wars were in Belville prison (1967\u20131969) and in Brandvlei prison (1974\u20131976). In both these cases the 26s were declared as the \"ruling party\".\n\n==Trial and punishment==\n===Punishments===\nThe gang has a strict code of conduct and failure to abide by these rules has severe consequences for the perpetrator.\n\nUpon the outcome of the trial a punishment is chosen. The ultimate punishment is death. An execution squad will carry out the order. They could possibly suffocate the offender in their bed or slit their throat. The death punishment is known as a \"number one\".\n\nThe second worst punishment just short of death is to be raped by a prisoner that is known to carry HIV. This practice is known as \"slow puncture\".The offender's anus is cut open so it bleeds, thus ensuring infection. The gang holds the offender down and the HIV-infected prisoner then proceeds to rape the offender.\n\nLess severe forms of punishment include \"klappe\" (hits) which involves 10 slaps to the face with an open hand, and the \"beker\" (mug) which involves blows on the head with a tin cup attached to a sock.\n\nOther forms of punishment include gang rape and what is known as a \"carry on\" where the offender lifts up his arms and is beaten with padlocks, stick and cups.\n\nPunishments that do not involve any harm to the offender would involve the murder of a non-gang member.\n\n== Other numbers gangs ==\nThere are other number gangs who are not recognised by the 26s, 27s and 28s. The Desperadoes are the 29s and the Big Five are the 25s, but they are referred to as \"dirty dogs\" and are not given the same status or respect as members of the numbers gang. Under certain conditions it is compulsory to kill a member of the Big Five gang.{{Cn|date=September 2019}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Information sources==\n* \u00abGod\u2019s children\u00bb, Heather Parker Lewis, 2006 - {{ISBN|978-1-920103-11-8}}\n* \u00ab[[Nongoloza's Children]]: Western Cape Prison Gangs During and After Apartheid\u00bb, Jonny Steinberg\n* Van Zyl Smit, Dirk \"South African prison law and practice\", Butterworths, 1992\n* Durban.

They are known to operate primarily in the [[Western Cape]] prison of [[Pollsmoor Prison|Pollsmoor]], however it is believed that they are present in most South African prisons.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n==Origin==\n{{story|date=November 2012}}\nThe Numbers Gang was started in the late 1800s, supposedly to protect mineworkers. The origins of the gang remain sketchy at best. Amongst gang members, the likely apocryphal story of [[Nongoloza]] and Ngeleketshane is claimed as the gangs origin.\n\nThe Numbers Gang story holds that a man named Po became alarmed by the exploitation of miners in late 1800's South Africa. Allegedly Po befriends a young [[Zulu people|Zulu]] called [[Nongoloza]] who said he was on his way to the mines to look for work and Ngeleketshane, a member of the [[Pondo people|Pondo tribe]]. Po eventually recruits 15 young men. He teaches them a secret language and [[highway robbery]]. The men succeed in robbing travelers and colonial outposts of their goods. The gang chooses to change their habits to avoid being caught. They move from cave to cave and split themselves into two groups: Ngeleketshane with his seven men who rob by the day, and Nongoloza and his six men who rob by night. Po orders the two men to carve their daily [[outlaw]] activities on a nearby rock which is to serve as a diary.\n\nPo then orders the two men to visit a farm, owned by a Mr. Rabie, and to buy one of his bulls called Rooiland (Red Earth). Mr. Rabie is suspicious, and he refuses to sell the two men the bull. The two youths refuse to leave without carrying out their order, and proceed to stab the farmer with [[bayonet]]s and then steal the bull, and slaughter it for a feast.\n\nPo orders the men to take the hide of the bull and press it onto the diary rock until the words have been transferred from the rock to the hide. With two copies of the gang's way, Po explains the [[bandit]]s must follow the rules as they have been set out from the beginning. The two items are divided between the two men. Nongoloza receives the hide and Ngeleketshane receives the rock. The two are instructed to carry them wherever they go. The [[Rock (geology)|rock]], however, proves to be too awkward to carry and one day it is accidentally dropped down a hill. It splits into two pieces, one of which falls into a river. This leaves Ngeleketshane's gang with only half of the gang's laws.\n\nThe first conflict of the two gangs takes place because of this incident. The two gangs decide to embark on a joint expedition. Nongoloza says he is sick and decides to stay behind. He asks one of Ngeleketshane's soldiers, Magubane, to stay behind. Upon returning Ngeleketshane finds Nongoloza engaged in homosexual acts with Magubane. Enraged, Kilikijan challenges Nongoloza to a fight. Nongoloza replies that according to the hide sex between bandits is allowed as to avoid contact with women. Kilikijan retaliates by saying that he does not trust Nongoloza, believing he added this law to the hide after half his rock went missing. The two men commence fighting until they are both drenched in blood, and Po arrives to intervene.\n\nPo listens to both men's sides of the story. He then tells Ngeleketshane to travel to the mines to see if men were engaging in sex with one another. Ngeleketshane finds that this does indeed take place, but opinions remained divided as to whether this justified Nongoloza's act. This was to become the pivotal disagreement between the two gangs that persist to this day. Po had informed the men that at the entrance of his cave was an old [[assegai]], and if the two men found the tip of the assegai rusted, it would mean that Po had died. Due to the death of Po, a final decision on whether sexual intercourse between men was allowed never came to pass.\n\nThis prediction had come true and the two gangs decided to go their separate ways: Nongoloza's gang with its now eight men (which included Magubane, who he decided to take with him) and Kilikijan's gang with its seven. It is said that this is where the numbers \"27\" and \"28\" originated, with the number \"2\" symbolising the two leaders. The gangs agree that the day would still be divided between them as it had always been. The gangs continued to roam the countryside until they both ended up in Point Prison in [[Durban]].\n\nIt was at Point Prison that they encountered a group of six men, led by a man named Grey, who were franse (non-[[gangster]]s). The six men would sit in a circle and flip a single silver coin between them. Nongoloza demanded that the men hand over their possessions to him; he is refused. Later he is told by Ngeleketshane that these men were skilled [[smuggler]]s and [[gambler]]s who had helped him in his early days in prison.<ref>Van Onselen, New Babylon, New Nineveh, 368\u2013397.</ref>\n\nNongoloza decides to name the coin a \"''Spyker''\" (nail) while Ngeleketshane insists that they should call it a \"''Kroon''\" (crown). A fight broke out between Nongoloza and Ngeleketshane about the future of the gamblers. Ngeleketshane defended the gamblers against the 28's sexual appetites, which is what Nongoloza wanted them for.\n\nAfter many disagreements it was finally decided by Nongoloza that the new group would be called the \"26s\". This name was chosen because they had six men but also because Nongoloza wanted to indicate their inferior status. Nongoloza informed Ngeleketshane that he and his men would have to answer for the actions of the 26s.\n\nFinally the three camps were formed. The '''26s''' were responsible for gambling, smuggling and accruing wealth in general. The '''28s''' were the [[warrior]]s and responsible for fighting on behalf of all three groups, and the '''27s''' were the guardians of gang law and the peace keepers between all the gangs.\n\nNew rules and a strict [[code of conduct]] were drawn up. It was decided that when a gangster broke a rule, the blood of a warder or franse (non-gangster) must be spilled to set things right.\n\n==Numbers==\n\n=== 26s ===\nThe 26s' duty is to accumulate wealth for all the numbers.<ref>Haysom, N. (1981). Towards an understanding of prison gangs Institute of Criminology, University of Cape Town.</ref> The 26s have no private line and a [[Prison sexuality|wyfie]] may not join the gang. Although a member of the 26s may take a wyfie for himself, it is strictly against the laws as set out in the book of 26s.\n\nThe [[gang]] has a very specific hierarchy and is structured as follows:\n\n:{{Col-begin|width=60%}}\n{{Col-break}}\n;The Number Ones\n:(Top Structure)\n* Government Makwezie\n* General Number 1\n* Inspector Number 1\n* Doctor Number 1\n* Maballaan (clerk) Number 1\n* Prokureur (Lawyer) Number 1\n* Landdros Number 1 (magistrate)\n* Judge Number 1\n* Captain Number 1\n{{Col-break}}\n;The Number twos\n:(Secondary Structure)\n* General number 2\n* Inspector number 2\n* Doctor number 2\n* Maballaan number 2\n* Judge number 2\n* Captain number 2\n* Sergeant Major\n* Sergeant number 1\n* Sergeant number 33\n* The Heksman (guard)\n* Soldiers\n{{col-end}}\n\nIn the number 2s and the number 1s there is a number 1's and number 2's ''twelve point ring', for number 4's and 5's, but not 6's or 7's, who have an 11 point ring, unless theyre number 8's. ' which makes gang decisions according to their jurisdictions. Each rank has its own assigned office and duties which include [[training]] lower rank members in the duties and codes of the gang.<ref>Schurink, W. J. (1989). The world of the Wetslaners: an analysis of some organisational features in South African prisons. Acta Criminologica 2:2, 60\u201370.</ref>\n\nThe 26s have historically been considered{{who|date=November 2012}} an inferior gang and have lived in the shadow of the 28s; however in some prisons they have risen up against the 28s and controlled the prisons. (See \"general elections\", below)and in some prisons like westville 26 are ruling those prisons .\n\n===28s===\nThe 28s are the blood line of the gang.  the 28's are responsible for the fighting/war amongst the three gangs (26, 27 and 28). They are divided into two lines \u2013 the gold line and the silver line. Haysom's study (1981) on prison gangs is based on Supreme Court trial records and supplemented with some interviews with ex-offenders. Schurink's paper (1989) summarises the findings of a study on prison gangs commissioned by the Department of Correctional Services. For this study, in depth interviews were conducted with sixty prisoners, mainly coloured men serving in St Albans and Brandvlei prisons. Prisoners were also encouraged to write about their prison experiences providing a number of personal manuscripts.\n\nThe gold line are the warriors, the descendants of Nongoloza. They are for fighting the gang's battles.\n\nThe silver line are the female, and are the descendants of Magubane. They are considered to be the [[sex slave]]s of the gold line.\n\nThe emblem of the 28s is the Zulu shield, whose skin is made out of the legendary Rooiland cow's remains.\n\nIn the 28s it is important to prove your manhood and move up in the rankings. A member moves up the ranks through the stabbing or killing of rival gangs, [[prison guard]]s or disobedient members. Should a member stay in the lower ranks he will still be considered a woman and will be sexually abused until he proves his manhood.\n\n===Recruitment into the 28s===\nWhen a new prisoner is assigned a cell he will be introduced to the person in charge of that cell known as the \"cell cleaner\". The cell cleaner will welcome the new prisoner to the cell, and will either leave him alone for the evening, or will demand sex.\n\nThe new prisoners will be observed by a senior member of the gang known as \"die glas\" (the binoculars). The glas' job is to conduct gang business in ''die bos'' (the bush), the parts of the prison where the 28s are not active. The glas will then confront a potential new recruit and give him a riddle. How the new prisoner answers the riddle will determine which department of the gang he will fall under.\n\nThe glas will generally watch the way new members interact with other franse (non-gang members). He will watch how the new prisoner deals with conflict, the way he solves problems and the way he walks and talks. The glas then approaches the new prisoner and will say \"I am going to ask you a question. Think very carefully before answering.\" The glas will go on to say, \"It is raining. You are standing under an umbrella. I say to you I am getting wet; I may get sick. What are you going to do?\" The new inmate's answer will determine his future in the prison. If he should say \"I invite you to share my umbrella\" he would become a sex slave and would not become a member of the 28s. If he should say \"I will come out into the rain with you\" it means that the new inmate is saying that he is prepared to live like him; they are brothers and they will live and die together.\n\nAfter the glas is satisfied with the answer of the new inmate, he is given a task to become a member. This task could either be the fatal or non-fatal [[stabbing]] of another inmate or warden. The new recruit will be given a knife whose length is determined by another senior member of the gang known as the nyangi (the doctor). Should the gang want the stabbing to be fatal the nyangi will give the new recruit a longer blade, and a shorter one in the event the gang wants a non-lethal stabbing.\n\nOnce the stabbing has taken place all the gang members watching will shout \"Nangampela!<ref>\"Nangampela\" is an isiZulu word that means, literally, \"There it is, indeed!\"</ref> Die nommer is vol!\" (The number is complete).\n\nOn a Sunday, the \"day of rights\", his ceremony is performed. He is once again ordered to stand in the middle of the room; however this time he is surrounded by several people. The first person to approach him is the nyangi. The nyangi then takes a gold pipe and slaps it on the new recruit's right wrist, then takes a silver pipe and slaps it on the new recruit's left wrist. He then checks the recruit's pulse and declares either \"''Die man se pols klop twee keer per jaar''\" (This man's pulse beats twice a year) or \"''Die man se pols klop drie keer per jaar'''\" (This man's pulse beats three times a year). Should he mention that his pulse beats twice it would mean the new recruit is being recruited onto the silver line, if three times it means he is being recruited onto the gold line.\n\nThe gwenza (senior member) then places a handkerchief on the floor and slips a knife under it. He stands and says to the recruit: \"From today you are no longer a frans. You are a 28. You will never swear at your brother. You will never hurt your brother. You will never do anything that reflects badly on the camp. If you leave the camp, you leave by your own blood.\"\n\nThe landdros (magistrate) will then come forward and take out his green and white stamps and give the new member his approval. The landdros carries four stamps \u2013 white, green, red and black, which signify the four hooves on the Rooiland.\n\nThese stamps signify promotion. When a member of the silver line is promoted he takes out his green and white stamp; if the member is from the gold line he takes out the green and the red stamps. The black stamp is reserved for the death sentence.\n\nThe ending of the ceremony is signalled by the new recruit being marched out of the circle. The 28s then take the new recruit to the 26s and 27s.\n\nThe new recruit will then sleep alongside different members of the 28 gang and be told what his duties are. He will also begin to learn the history of Nongoloza and Kilikijan. It will only be a brief fragment of the story, for he is still too junior to hear the whole story.\n\nThe 40s are senior but inactive due to being too old or too injured for active duty. Another reason a person could be a mamboza is because his position has already being filled by another member. A prison cannot have two active nyangis for example, and if another nyangi is transferred from another prison he is considered dormant \u2013 he sleeps in the forties.\n\nThe mambozas begin to teach the new member to sabela (speak prison language). It is a long and gruelling process. The new member has to sabela all day and night with his blackboard (teacher). The first two months being a member of the number means that a new member is not allowed to receive visits, write letters or read books. They must focus on the number. If somebody learns too slowly the punishments are severe. New members can be stripped of all their clothes and thrown into an ice cold shower until they \"find the number\" (get it right).\n\nOne of the last things new members learn is about a position in the silver line held by a man named Mtjoetijies. This man is dead but his place in the hierarchy is left empty. Legend has it that Mtjoetijies was a translator, for Nongoloza who refused to speak the language of the white oppressor. Nongoloza grew increasingly wary about what Mtjoetijies was saying to the white officers, and decided to take action and kill him as a precaution. The position remains open as a reminder that the 28s do not negotiate with words, they negotiate with action.\n\nThis ritual, however, has now changed. The fundamental principles remain the same; however, in modern 28 law the man who trains you is now allowed also to have sex with you. This change came along because of the war between the silver and gold lines of the number.\n\n===The 28s War===\nIn the late '80s a decision was taken to stop bloodlines (no stabbing). The silver line complained that the gold line were now not doing their jobs. The gold line complained about the silver line being greedy with the food. In the days when the bloodlines were still open the gold line members had a very strict diet to follow as they were not allowed to get fat. They were not allowed to eat eggs for example and were never allowed sugar with the coffee and their porridge. All these items went to the silver lines instead. Upon the closing of the bloodlines the gold line demanded that they get the food they wanted since there was no longer a need to stay fit. The silver line refused, and thus the gold line declared war on the silver line.\n\nWithin months hostilities had ceased. The hospital beds were filled with soldiers from the 28 gang.\n\nThe gold line formally offered their surrender. The silver line then set out their terms. They closed down the gold line and vowed that it would never be opened again. They threw the soldiers out of their ranks and filled these ranks with silver line members. They then decreed that nobody would have to take blood to join the 28s again. They also changed the initiation rules: they stated that any person who wished to join the 28s had to have sex with their teacher.\n\nThe rule of the blood has, however, changed. Modern members are now expected both to kill upon order of their general as well as have sex with their teacher, they are also expected to know the \"Number\" to the extent that the new members would be waken up in the middle of the night and asked the \"Number\" if they get it wrong they would have to have sex with any fellow brother or be asked to kill an inmate.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Relationship between the numbers===\nThe two 28s are not allowed to speak directly to the 26s. They communicate through the 27s. In the event that the 28s have recruited a new member, the 28s will inform the 27s who then will inform the 26s. This is seen as a \"hands off\" warning to the other gangs.\n\n==Relationships with franse (non gang members)==\n{{Unref sect|date=September 2019}}\nThe numbers gangs refer to themselves as ndodas (men) and refer to non-gang members as franse. The frans is stripped of his juridical personhood. He is not seen as a human to the gangs.\n\nThe frans must submit everything he has to the ndodas, but the franse are protected from the numbers by being housed in different cells.\n\n===Relationship with warders===\nThe relationship between gang members and the warders is a complex and an uneasy one. Under the apartheid regime they feared the warders.  They knew that the warders would not be watched by human rights groups, so when there was a stabbing of an officer the warders would beat the gang members to within an inch of their lives.\n\nUnder the new system however the warders have become targets.  The numbers gang are well aware that the consequences of their actions will not result in a beating or the death penalty, and therefore new initiates are encouraged to stab a warden or even to attempt to take his eye out of the socket.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nOne of the most compelling messages that the numbers gang members like to send to the warders, is by holding up a mirror toward the warden.  This deviates from the traditional practice of holding up an image of an inmate.  The message the numbers are said to be sending is \"We are what you are. You are an army, we are an army. Where you have a head of the prison, we will have a judge. Where you have a head of a section, we will have a general. Whatever you do to us, we will do to you in turn.\"\n\n==The numbers network==\nOne notable feature of the numbers gang is that it is a nationwide brotherhood that is prevalent in every prison across South Africa.\n\nMembers that betray the gang are not safe in any South African prison, as the numbers control every prison in South Africa. The secretive nature of the gang makes their system of communicating to other prisons unknown. This is what makes them probably the most dangerous prison gang in the world.\n\n==General elections==\nTraditionally the 28 gang has been the dominant gang. This still holds true in prisons such as Pollsmoor prison. However the balance of power now varies from prison to prison over time. When one of the number gangs feels it can take control of the prison, they declare a \"general election\" in which an all out war is waged, often lasting up to two years until one gang is declared the \"ruling party\". Two famous cases of these wars were in Belville prison (1967\u20131969) and in Brandvlei prison (1974\u20131976). In both these cases the 26s were declared as the \"ruling party\".\n\n==Trial and punishment==\n===Punishments===\nThe gang has a strict code of conduct and failure to abide by these rules has severe consequences for the perpetrator.\n\nUpon the outcome of the trial a punishment is chosen. The ultimate punishment is death. An execution squad will carry out the order. They could possibly suffocate the offender in their bed or slit their throat. The death punishment is known as a \"number one\".\n\nThe second worst punishment just short of death is to be raped by a prisoner that is known to carry HIV. This practice is known as \"slow puncture\".The offender's anus is cut open so it bleeds, thus ensuring infection. The gang holds the offender down and the HIV-infected prisoner then proceeds to rape the offender.\n\nLess severe forms of punishment include \"klappe\" (hits) which involves 10 slaps to the face with an open hand, and the \"beker\" (mug) which involves blows on the head with a tin cup attached to a sock.\n\nOther forms of punishment include gang rape and what is known as a \"carry on\" where the offender lifts up his arms and is beaten with padlocks, stick and cups.\n\nPunishments that do not involve any harm to the offender would involve the murder of a non-gang member.\n\n== Other numbers gangs ==\nThere are other number gangs who are not recognised by the 26s, 27s and 28s. The Desperadoes are the 29s and the Big Five are the 25s, but they are referred to as \"dirty dogs\" and are not given the same status or respect as members of the numbers gang. Under certain conditions it is compulsory to kill a member of the Big Five gang.{{Cn|date=September 2019}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Information sources==\n* \u00abGod\u2019s children\u00bb, Heather Parker Lewis, 2006 - {{ISBN|978-1-920103-11-8}}\n* \u00ab[[Nongoloza's Children]]: Western Cape Prison Gangs During and After Apartheid\u00bb, Jonny Steinberg\n* Van Zyl Smit, Dirk \"South African prison law and practice\", Butterworths, 1992\n* Durban.

It was known that hot, high-speed objects caused ionization of the atmosphere that reflects [[radar]] waves, and it appeared that a warhead's signature would be different enough from decoys that a detector could pick out the warhead directly, or alternately, provide added information that would allow operators to focus a conventional tracking radar on the single return from the warhead.<ref name=darpa/><ref name=press/>\n\nAlthough the concept appeared to offer a solution to the tracking problem, there was almost no information on either the physics of re-entry or a strong understanding of the normal composition of the upper layers of the [[ionosphere]]. ARPA began to address both simultaneously.

This design would have limited its use in other research areas, such as [[radar astronomy]], [[radio astronomy]] and atmospheric science, which require the ability to point at different positions in the sky and track those positions for an extended time as Earth rotates. Ward Low of the [[Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (ARPA) pointed out this flaw and put Gordon in touch with the [[Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories|Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratory]] (AFCRL) in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], where one group headed by Phil Blacksmith was working on spherical reflectors and another group was studying the propagation of [[radio wave]]s in and through the upper atmosphere. Cornell University proposed the project to ARPA in mid-1958 and a contract was signed between the AFCRL and the University in November 1959. Cornell University and Zachary Sears published a request for proposals (RFP) asking for a design to support a feed moving along a spherical surface {{convert|435|ft|m|0}} above the stationary reflector. The RFP suggested a tripod or a tower in the center to support the feed. On the day the project for the design and construction of the antenna was announced at Cornell University, Gordon had also envisioned a {{convert|435|ft|m|abbr=on}} tower centered in the {{convert|1000|ft|m|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} reflector to support the feed.<ref>{{Citation\n| last  = Gordon\n| first = William\n| author-link = William E.

[[George Doundoulakis]] identified the problem that a tower or tripod would have presented around the center, (the most important area of the reflector), and devised a better design by suspending the [[antenna feed|feed]].<ref name=\"Fr\u00e8 276\"/><ref name=\"Gold 119\"/> He presented his proposal to [[Cornell University]] for a doughnut or [[torus]]-type [[truss]] suspended by four cables from four towers above the reflector, having along its edge a rail track for the [[azimuth]]al [[truss]] positioning. This second [[truss]], in the form of an arc, or [[arch]], was to be suspended below, which would rotate on the rails through 360 degrees. The arc also had rails on which the unit supporting the feed would move for the feed's elevational positioning. A [[counterweight]] would move symmetrically opposite to the feed for stability and, if a hurricane struck, the whole feed could be raised and lowered. [[Helias Doundoulakis]] designed the [[Wire rope|cable]] suspension system which was finally adopted. Although the present configuration is substantially the same as the original drawings by George and [[Helias Doundoulakis]], (although with three towers, instead of the original four as drawn in the original patent), the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent office]] granted [[Helias Doundoulakis]] a patent,<ref>{{US patent reference| number = 3273156| y = 1966| m = 09| d = 13| inventor = Helias Doundoulakis| title = Radio Telescope having a scanning feed supported by a cable suspension over a stationary reflector}}</ref> for the brothers' innovative idea. Two other assignees on the patent were friends [[William J. Casey]], who later became director of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] under President [[Ronald Reagan]], and Constantine Michalos, an attorney.\n\nThe idea of a spherical reflecting mirror with a steerable secondary has since been used in optical telescopes, in particular, the [[Hobby\u2013Eberly Telescope]] and the [[Southern African Large Telescope]].\n\nConstruction began in mid-1960, with the official opening on November 1, 1963.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?vendorId=FWNE.fw..ar136000.a |title=Arecibo Observatory |publisher=History.com |accessdate=2008-09-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090314225635/http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?vendorId=FWNE.fw..ar136000.a |archivedate=March 14, 2009 }}</ref> As the primary dish is [[spherical]], its focus is along a line rather than at one point, as would be the case for a [[parabolic reflector]]. As a result, complex line feeds were implemented to carry out observations. Each line feed covered a narrow [[Frequency range|frequency band]]: 2\u20135% of the center frequency of the band. A limited number of line feeds could be used at any one time, limiting the telescope's flexibility.\n\nSince then, the telescope has been upgraded several times. Initially, when the maximum expected operating frequency was about 500&nbsp;MHz, the surface consisted of half-inch galvanized wire mesh laid directly on the support cables. In 1974, a high-precision surface consisting of 40,000 individually adjustable aluminum panels replaced the old wire mesh, and the highest usable frequency rose to about 5000&nbsp;MHz. A [[Gregorian telescope|Gregorian reflector system]] was installed in 1997, incorporating secondary and tertiary reflectors to focus radio waves at one point. This allowed installing a suite of receivers, covering the full 1\u201310&nbsp;GHz range, that could be easily moved to the [[Focus (optics)|focal point]], giving Arecibo more flexibility. A metal mesh screen was also installed around the perimeter to block the ground's thermal radiation from reaching the feed antennas. Finally, a more powerful 2400&nbsp;MHz transmitter was added.\n\n{{wide image|Arecibo Radiotelescopio Panamorama SJU 06 2019 7446.jpg|1200px|Panoramic view of the Arecibo radio telescope primary dish}}\n\n== Research and discoveries ==\n[[File:Arecibo message.svg|125px|right|thumb|The [[Arecibo message]] with added color to highlight the separate parts.

It was known that hot, high-speed objects caused ionization of the atmosphere that reflects [[radar]] waves, and it appeared that a warhead's signature would be different enough from decoys that a detector could pick out the warhead directly, or alternately, provide added information that would allow operators to focus a conventional tracking radar on the single return from the warhead.<ref name=darpa/><ref name=press/>\n\nAlthough the concept appeared to offer a solution to the tracking problem, there was almost no information on either the physics of re-entry or a strong understanding of the normal composition of the upper layers of the [[ionosphere]]. ARPA began to address both simultaneously. To better understand the radar returns from a warhead, several radars were built on [[Kwajalein Atoll]], while Arecibo started with the dual purpose of understanding the ionosphere's F-layer while also producing a general-purpose scientific radio observatory.<ref name=darpa/><ref name=press/>\n\nThe observatory was built between mid-1960 and November 1963.

This design would have limited its use in other research areas, such as [[radar astronomy]], [[radio astronomy]] and atmospheric science, which require the ability to point at different positions in the sky and track those positions for an extended time as Earth rotates. Ward Low of the [[Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (ARPA) pointed out this flaw and put Gordon in touch with the [[Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories|Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratory]] (AFCRL) in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], where one group headed by Phil Blacksmith was working on spherical reflectors and another group was studying the propagation of [[radio wave]]s in and through the upper atmosphere. Cornell University proposed the project to ARPA in mid-1958 and a contract was signed between the AFCRL and the University in November 1959. Cornell University and Zachary Sears published a request for proposals (RFP) asking for a design to support a feed moving along a spherical surface {{convert|435|ft|m|0}} above the stationary reflector. The RFP suggested a tripod or a tower in the center to support the feed. On the day the project for the design and construction of the antenna was announced at Cornell University, Gordon had also envisioned a {{convert|435|ft|m|abbr=on}} tower centered in the {{convert|1000|ft|m|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} reflector to support the feed.<ref>{{Citation\n| last  = Gordon\n| first = William\n| author-link = William E.

[[George Doundoulakis]] identified the problem that a tower or tripod would have presented around the center, (the most important area of the reflector), and devised a better design by suspending the [[antenna feed|feed]].<ref name=\"Fr\u00e8 276\"/><ref name=\"Gold 119\"/> He presented his proposal to [[Cornell University]] for a doughnut or [[torus]]-type [[truss]] suspended by four cables from four towers above the reflector, having along its edge a rail track for the [[azimuth]]al [[truss]] positioning. This second [[truss]], in the form of an arc, or [[arch]], was to be suspended below, which would rotate on the rails through 360 degrees. The arc also had rails on which the unit supporting the feed would move for the feed's elevational positioning. A [[counterweight]] would move symmetrically opposite to the feed for stability and, if a hurricane struck, the whole feed could be raised and lowered. [[Helias Doundoulakis]] designed the [[Wire rope|cable]] suspension system which was finally adopted. Although the present configuration is substantially the same as the original drawings by George and [[Helias Doundoulakis]], (although with three towers, instead of the original four as drawn in the original patent), the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent office]] granted [[Helias Doundoulakis]] a patent,<ref>{{US patent reference| number = 3273156| y = 1966| m = 09| d = 13| inventor = Helias Doundoulakis| title = Radio Telescope having a scanning feed supported by a cable suspension over a stationary reflector}}</ref> for the brothers' innovative idea. Two other assignees on the patent were friends [[William J. Casey]], who later became director of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] under President [[Ronald Reagan]], and Constantine Michalos, an attorney.\n\nThe idea of a spherical reflecting mirror with a steerable secondary has since been used in optical telescopes, in particular, the [[Hobby\u2013Eberly Telescope]] and the [[Southern African Large Telescope]].\n\nConstruction began in mid-1960, with the official opening on November 1, 1963.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?vendorId=FWNE.fw..ar136000.a |title=Arecibo Observatory |publisher=History.com |accessdate=2008-09-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090314225635/http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?vendorId=FWNE.fw..ar136000.a |archivedate=March 14, 2009 }}</ref> As the primary dish is [[spherical]], its focus is along a line rather than at one point, as would be the case for a [[parabolic reflector]]. As a result, complex line feeds were implemented to carry out observations. Each line feed covered a narrow [[Frequency range|frequency band]]: 2\u20135% of the center frequency of the band. A limited number of line feeds could be used at any one time, limiting the telescope's flexibility.\n\nSince then, the telescope has been upgraded several times. Initially, when the maximum expected operating frequency was about 500&nbsp;MHz, the surface consisted of half-inch galvanized wire mesh laid directly on the support cables. In 1974, a high-precision surface consisting of 40,000 individually adjustable aluminum panels replaced the old wire mesh, and the highest usable frequency rose to about 5000&nbsp;MHz. A [[Gregorian telescope|Gregorian reflector system]] was installed in 1997, incorporating secondary and tertiary reflectors to focus radio waves at one point. This allowed installing a suite of receivers, covering the full 1\u201310&nbsp;GHz range, that could be easily moved to the [[Focus (optics)|focal point]], giving Arecibo more flexibility. A metal mesh screen was also installed around the perimeter to block the ground's thermal radiation from reaching the feed antennas. Finally, a more powerful 2400&nbsp;MHz transmitter was added.\n\n{{wide image|Arecibo Radiotelescopio Panamorama SJU 06 2019 7446.jpg|1200px|Panoramic view of the Arecibo radio telescope primary dish}}\n\n== Research and discoveries ==\n[[File:Arecibo message.svg|125px|right|thumb|The [[Arecibo message]] with added color to highlight the separate parts.

They are generated by an electronic device called a [[transmitter]] connected to an [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] which radiates the waves, and received by a [[radio receiver]] connected to another antenna. Radio is very widely used in modern technology, in radio communication, [[radar]], [[radio navigation]], [[remote control]], [[remote sensing]] and other applications.\n\nIn '''radio communication''', used in [[radio broadcasting|radio]] and [[television broadcasting]], [[cell phone]]s, [[two-way radio]]s, [[wireless networking]] and [[satellite communication]] among numerous other uses, radio waves are used to carry information across space from a transmitter to a receiver, by [[modulating]] the radio signal (impressing an information signal on the radio wave by varying some aspect of the wave) in the transmitter. In [[radar]], used to locate and track objects like aircraft, ships, spacecraft and missiles, a beam of radio waves emitted by a radar transmitter reflects off the target object, and the reflected waves reveal the object's location.   In [[radio navigation]] systems such as [[global positioning system|GPS]] and [[VHF omnidirectional range|VOR]], a mobile receiver receives radio signals from [[radio beacon|navigational radio beacons]] whose position is known, and by precisely measuring the arrival time of the radio waves the receiver can calculate its position on Earth. In wireless [[radio control|radio remote control]] devices like [[drone (aircraft)|drone]]s, [[garage door opener]]s, and [[keyless entry system]]s, radio signals transmitted from a controller device control the actions of a remote device.\n\nApplications of radio waves which do not involve transmitting the waves significant distances, such as [[RF heating]] used in industrial processes and [[microwave oven]]s, and medical uses such as [[diathermy]] and [[MRI machine]]s, are not usually called ''radio''.  The noun ''radio'' is also used to mean a [[radio receiver|broadcast radio receiver]].\n\nRadio waves were first identified and studied by German physicist [[Heinrich Hertz]] in 1886. The first practical radio transmitters and receivers were developed around 1895-6 by Italian [[Guglielmo Marconi]], and radio began to be used commercially around 1900. To prevent interference between users, the emission of radio waves is strictly regulated by law, coordinated by an international body called the [[International Telecommunications Union]] (ITU), which allocates frequency bands in the [[radio spectrum]] for different uses.\n\n==Radio technology==\nRadio waves are radiated by [[electric charge]]s undergoing [[acceleration]].<ref name=\"Kraus\">{{cite book\n | last1  = Kraus\n | first1 = John D.\n | title  = Antennas, 2nd Ed.\n | publisher = Tata-McGraw Hill\n | date   = 1988\n | pages  = 50\n | url    = https://archive.org/details/Antennas2ndbyjohnD.Kraus1988/page/n75\n | doi    = \n | id     = \n | isbn   = 0074632191\n }}</ref><ref name=\"Serway\">{{cite book|last1=Serway|first1=Raymond|last2=Faughn|first2=Jerry|last3=Vuille|first3=Chris|title=College Physics, 8th Ed.|publisher=Cengage Learning|date=2008|pages=714|language=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CX0u0mIOZ44C&pg=PA714&dq=%22electromagnetic+wave%22+charge+acceleration|doi=|id=|isbn=0495386936}}</ref> They are generated artificially by time varying [[electric current]]s, consisting of [[electron]]s flowing back and forth in a metal conductor called an [[antenna (radio)|antenna]],<ref name=\"Balanis\">{{cite book\n | last1  = Balanis\n | first1 = Constantine A.\n | title  = Antenna theory: Analysis and Design, 3rd Ed.\n | publisher = John Wiley and Sons\n | date   = 2005\n | pages  = [https://archive.org/details/Antenna.Theory.Analysis.and.Design3rd.Edition/page/n22 10]\n | url    = https://archive.org/details/Antenna.Theory.Analysis.and.Design3rd.Edition\n | doi    = \n | id     = \n | isbn   = 9781118585733\n }}</ref><ref name=\"Ellingson2\">{{cite book|last1=Ellingson|first1=Steven W.|title=Radio Systems Engineering|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=2016|pages=16\u201317|language=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QMKSDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA16&dq=%22radio+wave%22+time+varying+electric+current|doi=|id=|isbn=1316785165}}</ref> thus accelerating.  In transmission, a [[transmitter]] generates an [[alternating current]] of [[radio frequency]] which is applied to an antenna. The antenna radiates the power in the current as radio waves. When the waves strike the antenna of a [[radio receiver]], they push the electrons in the metal back and forth, inducing a tiny alternating current. The radio receiver connected to the receiving antenna detects this oscillating current and amplifies it.\n\nAs they travel farther from the transmitting antenna, radio waves spread out so their [[signal strength]] ([[intensity (physics)|intensity]] in watts per square meter) decreases, so radio transmissions can only be received within a limited range of the transmitter, the distance depending on the transmitter power, antenna [[radiation pattern]], receiver sensitivity, noise level, and presence of obstructions between transmitter and receiver.  An [[omnidirectional antenna]] transmits or receives radio waves in all directions, while a [[directional antenna]] or [[high gain antenna]] transmits radio waves in a beam in a particular direction, or receives waves from only one direction.\n\nRadio waves travel through a vacuum at the [[speed of light]], and in air at very close to the speed of light, so the [[wavelength]] of a radio wave, the distance in meters between adjacent crests of the wave, is inversely proportional to its [[frequency]].\n\nThe other types of [[electromagnetic wave]]s besides radio waves; [[infrared]], [[visible light]], [[ultraviolet]], [[X-ray]]s and [[gamma rays]], are also able to carry information and be used for communication.  The wide use of radio waves for telecommunication is mainly due to their desirable [[radio propagation|propagation]] properties stemming from their large [[wavelength]].<ref name=\"Ellingson2\" />  Radio waves have the ability to pass through the atmosphere, foliage, and most building materials, and by [[diffraction]] can bend around obstructions, and unlike other electromagnetic waves they tend to be scattered rather than absorbed by objects larger than their wavelength.  \n\n===Radio communication===\n[[File:Signal processing system.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Radio communication.  Information such as sound is converted by a transducer such as a [[microphone]] to an electrical signal, which modulates a [[radio wave]] produced by the [[transmitter]].

At the sending end, the information to be sent is converted by some type of [[transducer]] to a time-varying [[electrical signal]] called the modulation signal.<ref name=\"Ellingson2\" /><ref name=\"HowStuffWorks\">{{cite web|url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/radio8.htm|title=How Radio Works|first=Marshall|last=Brain|publisher=HowStuffWorks.com|date=2000-12-07|accessdate=2009-09-11}}</ref> The modulation signal may be an [[audio signal]] representing sound from a [[microphone]], a [[video signal]] representing moving images from a [[video camera]], or a [[digital signal]] consisting of a sequence of [[binary digit|bits]] representing binary data from a computer.  The modulation signal is applied to a [[radio transmitter]].  In the transmitter, an [[electronic oscillator]] generates an [[alternating current]] oscillating at a [[radio frequency]], called the ''[[carrier wave]]'' because it serves to \"carry\" the information through the air.  The information signal is used to [[modulation|modulate]] the carrier, varying some aspect of the carrier wave, impressing the information on the carrier.  Different radio systems use different [[modulation]] methods:\n*AM ([[amplitude modulation]]) \u2013 in an AM transmitter, the [[amplitude]] (strength) of the radio carrier wave is varied by the modulation signal.  \n*FM ([[frequency modulation]]) \u2013 in an FM transmitter, the [[frequency]] of the radio carrier wave is varied by the modulation signal.\n*FSK ([[frequency shift keying]]) \u2013 used in wireless digital devices to transmit [[digital signal]]s, the [[frequency]] of the carrier wave is shifted periodically between two frequencies that represent the two [[binary digit]]s, 0 and 1, to transmit a sequence of [[binary digit|bits]].\n*OFDM ([[orthogonal frequency division multiplexing]]) \u2013 a family of complicated [[digital modulation]] methods very widely used in high bandwidth systems such as [[WiFi]] networks, [[cellphone]]s, [[digital television]] broadcasting, and [[digital audio broadcasting]] (DAB) to transmit digital data using a minimum of [[radio spectrum]] bandwidth.  It has higher [[spectral efficiency]] and more resistance to [[fading]] than AM or FM.  In OFDM, multiple radio carrier waves closely spaced in frequency are transmitted within the radio channel, with each carrier modulated with bits from the incoming [[bitstream]] so multiple [[binary digit|bits]] are being sent simultaneously, in parallel.  At the receiver, the carriers are demodulated and the bits are combined in the proper order into one bitstream.\nMany other types of modulation are also used. In some types, a carrier wave is not transmitted but just one or both modulation [[sideband]]s.  The modulated carrier is [[amplifier|amplified]] in the transmitter and applied to a transmitting [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] which radiates the energy as radio waves.   The radio waves carry the information to the receiver location.\n\nAt the receiver, the radio wave induces a tiny oscillating [[voltage]] in the receiving antenna which is a weaker replica of the current in the transmitting antenna.<ref name=\"Ellingson2\" /><ref name=\"HowStuffWorks\" /> This voltage is applied to the [[radio receiver]], which [[amplifier|amplifies]] the weak radio signal so it is stronger, then [[demodulate]]s it, extracting the original modulation signal from the modulated carrier wave.  The modulation signal is converted by a [[transducer]] back to a human-usable form: an audio signal is converted to [[sound wave]]s by a loudspeaker or earphones, a [[video signal]] is converted to images by a [[display device|display]], while a digital signal is applied to a computer or microprocessor, which interacts with human users.\n\nThe radio waves from many transmitters pass through the air simultaneously without interfering with each other because each transmitter's radio waves oscillate at a different rate, in other words, each transmitter has a different [[frequency]], measured in [[kilohertz]] (kHz), [[megahertz]] (MHz) or [[gigahertz]] (GHz).   The receiving antenna typically picks up the radio signals of many transmitters.  The receiver uses ''[[tuned circuit]]s'' to select the radio signal desired out of all the signals picked up by the antenna and reject the others.  A [[tuned circuit]] (also called resonant circuit or tank circuit) acts like a [[resonator]], similarly to a [[tuning fork]].<ref name=\"HowStuffWorks\" /> It has a natural [[resonant frequency]] at which it oscillates.  The resonant frequency of the receiver's tuned circuit is adjusted by the user to the frequency of the desired radio station; this is called \"tuning\".  The oscillating radio signal from the desired station causes the tuned circuit to [[resonance|resonate]], oscillate in sympathy, and it passes the signal on to the rest of the receiver.  Radio signals at other frequencies are blocked by the tuned circuit and not passed on.\n\n===Bandwidth===\n[[File:Modulated radio signal frequency spectrum.svg|thumb|[[Frequency]] spectrum of a typical modulated AM or FM radio signal.  It consists of a component ''C'' at the [[carrier wave]] frequency <math>f_c</math> with the information ([[modulation]]) contained in two narrow bands of frequencies called [[sideband]]s (''SB'') just above and below the carrier frequency. ]]\n\nA modulated radio wave, carrying an information signal, occupies a range of [[frequency|frequencies]].  See diagram.  The information ([[modulation]]) in a radio signal is usually concentrated in narrow frequency bands called [[sideband]]s (''SB'') just above and below the [[carrier wave|carrier]] frequency.  The width in [[hertz]] of the frequency range that the radio signal occupies, the highest frequency minus the lowest frequency, is called its [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] (''BW'').<ref name=\"Spectrum101\">{{cite paper\n  | title = Spectrum 101\n  | version = \n  | publisher = US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)\n  | date = February 2016\n  | url = https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/spectrum_101.pdf\n  | format = \n  | accessdate = 2 December 2019}}, p. 6</ref>  For any given [[signal-to-noise ratio]], an amount of bandwidth can carry the same amount of information ([[data signaling rate|data rate]] in [[binary digit|bits]] per second) regardless of where in the radio frequency spectrum it is located, so bandwidth is a measure of [[channel capacity|information-carrying capacity]]. The bandwidth required by a radio transmission depends on the data rate of the information (modulation signal) being sent, and the [[spectral efficiency]] of the [[modulation]] method used; how much data it can transmit in each kilohertz of bandwidth.  Different types of information signals carried by radio have different data rates.  For example, a television (video) signal has a greater data rate than an [[audio signal]].\n\nThe [[radio spectrum]], the total range of radio frequencies that can be used for communication in a given area, is a limited resource.<ref name=\"Spectrum101\" /><ref name=\"Ellingson1\" /> Each radio transmission occupies a portion of the total bandwidth available.  Radio bandwidth is regarded as an [[economic good]] which has a monetary cost and is in increasing demand.  In some parts of the radio spectrum the right to use a frequency band or even a single radio channel is bought and sold for millions of dollars.  So there is an incentive to employ technology to minimize the bandwidth used by radio services.\n\nIn recent years there has been a transition from [[analog signal|analog]] to [[digital signal|digital]] radio transmission technologies.  Part of the reason for this is that [[digital modulation]] can often transmit more information (a greater data rate) in a given bandwidth than [[analog modulation]], by using [[data compression]] algorithms, which reduce redundancy in the data to be sent, and more efficient modulation.  Other reasons for the transition is that digital modulation has greater [[noise immunity]] than analog, [[digital signal processing]] chips have more power and flexibility than analog circuits, and a wide variety of types of information can be transmitted using the same digital modulation.\n\nBecause it is a fixed resource which is in demand by an increasing number of users, the [[radio spectrum]] has become increasingly congested in recent decades, and the need to use it more effectively is driving many additional radio innovations such as [[trunked radio system]]s, [[spread spectrum]] (ultra-wideband) transmission, [[frequency reuse]], [[dynamic spectrum management]], frequency pooling, and [[cognitive radio]].\n\n===ITU frequency bands===\nThe [[International Telecommunications Union|ITU]] arbitrarily divides the [[radio spectrum]] into 12 bands, each beginning at a [[wavelength]] which is a power of ten (10<sup>n</sup>)&nbsp;metres, with corresponding frequency of 3 times a power of ten, and each covering a decade of frequency or wavelength.<ref name=\"Ellingson1\" /><ref name=\"ITU2016\">{{cite paper\n  | title = Radio Regulations, 2016 Edition\n  | version = \n  | publisher = International Telecommunications Union\n  | date = 3 November 2016\n  | url = https://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-r/opb/reg/R-REG-RR-2016-ZPF-E.zip\n  | format = PDF\n  | accessdate = 9 November 2019 }} Article 2, Section 1, p.27</ref>  Each of these bands has a traditional name:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"text-align:left;\" \n!

The greater bandwidth available has motivated a continuing trend to exploit higher frequencies throughout radio's history.\n\n==Regulation==\nThe airwaves are a resource shared by many users.  Two radio transmitters in the same area that attempt to transmit on the same frequency will interfere with each other, causing garbled reception, so neither transmission may be received clearly.<ref name=\"Spectrum101\" /> [[radio frequency interference|Interference]] with radio transmissions can not only have a large economic cost, it can be life-threatening (for example, in the case of interference with emergency communications or [[air traffic control]]).\n\nTo prevent interference between different users, the emission of radio waves is strictly regulated by national laws, coordinated by an international body, the [[International Telecommunications Union]] (ITU), which allocates bands in the [[radio spectrum]] for different uses.<ref name=\"Spectrum101\" /><ref name=\"Ellingson1\" /> Radio transmitters must be licensed by governments, under a variety of license classes depending on use, and are restricted to certain frequencies and power levels.  In some classes, such as radio and television broadcasting stations, the transmitter is given a unique identifier consisting of a string of letters and numbers called a ''[[call sign]]'', which must be used in all transmissions.  The radio operator must hold a government license, such as the [[general radiotelephone operator license]] in the US, obtained by taking a test demonstrating adequate technical and legal knowledge of safe radio operation.\n\nExceptions to the above rules allow the unlicensed operation by the public of low power short range transmitters in consumer products such as [[cell phone]]s, [[cordless phone]]s, [[wireless device]]s, [[walkie-talkie]]s, [[citizens band radio]]s, [[wireless microphone]]s, [[garage door opener]]s, and [[baby monitor]]s. In the US, these fall under [[Part 15]] of the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) regulations.   Many of these devices use the [[ISM band]]s, a series of frequency bands throughout the radio spectrum reserved for unlicensed use.  Although they can be operated without a license, like all radio equipment these devices generally must be [[Type approval|type-approved]] before sale.\n\n==Applications==\nBelow are some of the most important uses of radio, organized by function.\n\n===Broadcasting===\n{{main|Broadcasting}}\n{{multiple image\n| direction = horizontal\n| total_width = 350\n| image1   = 2008-07-28 Mast radiator.jpg\n| caption1 = AM radio station\n| image2   = FM broadcasting antenna Willans Hill.jpg\n| caption2 = FM radio station\n| image3   = Superturnstile Tx Muehlacker.JPG\n| caption3 = Television station\n| footer   = Broadcasting antennas\n}}\n[[Broadcasting]] is the one-way transmission of information from a radio transmitter to receivers belonging to a public audience. Since the radio waves become weaker with distance, a [[broadcasting station]] can only be received within a limited distance of its transmitter.  Systems which broadcast from [[communication satellite|satellites]] can generally be received over an entire country or continent.  Older terrestrial radio and television is paid for by [[commercial advertising]] or governments.  In subscription systems like [[satellite television]] and [[satellite radio]] the customer pays a monthly fee.  In these systems the radio signal is [[encryption|encrypted]] and can only be decrypted by the receiver, which is controlled by the company and can be deactivated if the customer doesn't pay his bill.\n\nBroadcasting uses several parts of the radio spectrum, depending on the type of signals transmitted and the desired target audience. [[Longwave]] and [[medium wave]] signals can give reliable coverage of areas several hundred kilometres across, but have more limited information carrying capacity and so work best with audio signals (speech and music), and the sound quality can be degraded by [[radio noise]] from natural and artificial sources.  The [[shortwave]] bands have greater potential range, but are more subject to interference by distant stations and varying atmospheric conditions that affect reception.\n\nIn the [[very high frequency]] band, greater than 30 megahertz, the Earth's atmosphere has less of an effect on the range of signals, and [[line-of-sight propagation]] becomes the principle mode. These higher frequencies permit the great bandwidth required for television broadcasting.  Since natural and artificial noise sources are less present at these frequencies, high-quality audio transmission is possible, using [[frequency modulation]].  \n[[Image:KWNR Continental 816R-5B SN 247.jpg|thumb|FM broadcast transmitter of radio station [[W:KWNR|KWNR]], Las Vegas which transmits on 95.5&nbsp;MHz with a power of 35&nbsp;kW]]\n\n====Radio broadcasting====\n[[Radio broadcasting]] means transmission of [[audio signal|audio]] (sound) to radio receivers belonging to a public audience.  Analog audio is the earliest form of radio broadcast. [[AM broadcasting]] began around 1920. [[FM broadcasting]] was introduced in the late 1930s with improved [[fidelity]].\n\n[[Digital audio broadcasting]] (DAB) debuted in some countries in 1998. It transmits audio as a [[digital signal]] rather than an [[analog signal]] as AM and FM do.  DAB has the potential to provide higher quality sound than FM (although many stations do not choose to transmit at such high quality), has greater immunity to [[radio noise]] and interference, makes better use of scarce [[radio spectrum]] bandwidth, and provides advanced user features such as [[electronic program guide]]s.  Its disadvantage is that it is incompatible with previous radios so that a new DAB receiver must be purchased.   Most countries plan an eventual switchover from FM to DAB.  The United States and Canada have chosen not to implement DAB.\n\nA single DAB station transmits a 1,500&nbsp;kHz bandwidth signal that carries from 9 to 12 channels of digital audio modulated by [[orthogonal frequency division multiplexing|OFDM]] from which the listener can choose.  Broadcasters can transmit a channel at a range of different [[bit rate]]s, so different channels can have different audio quality.   In different countries DAB stations broadcast in either [[Band III]] (174\u2013240&nbsp;MHz) or [[L band]] (1.452\u20131.492&nbsp;GHz) in the UHF range, so like FM reception is limited by the visual horizon to about {{convert|40|miles|km|sigfig=2}}.\n\n[[Digital Radio Mondiale]] (DRM) is a competing digital terrestrial radio standard developed mainly by broadcasters as a higher [[spectral efficiency]] replacement for legacy AM and FM broadcasting.  ''Mondiale'' means \"worldwide\" in French and Italian, and DRM, developed in 2001, is currently supported by 23 countries and has been adopted by some European and Eastern broadcasters beginning in 2003. The DRM30 mode uses the AM broadcast bands below 30&nbsp;MHz and is intended as a replacement for AM and shortwave broadcasting, and the DRM+ mode uses [[very high frequency|VHF]] frequencies centered on the FM broadcast band and is intended as a replacement for FM broadcasting.  It is incompatible with existing radio receivers and requires listeners to purchase a new DRM receiver. The modulation used is a form of [[orthogonal frequency division multiplexing|OFDM]] called [[COFDM]] in which up to 4 carriers are transmitted in a channel formerly occupied by a single AM or FM signal, modulated by [[quadrature amplitude modulation]] (QAM).  The DRM system is designed to be as compatible as possible with existing AM and FM radio transmitters, so much of the equipment in existing radio stations will not have to be replaced.\n\n[[Satellite radio]] is a subscription radio service that broadcasts CD quality [[digital audio]] direct to subscribers' receivers using a [[microwave]] [[downlink]] signal from a [[communications satellite|direct broadcast communication satellite]] in [[geostationary]] orbit 22,000 miles above the Earth.  It is mostly intended for [[car radio]]s in vehicles.   Satellite radio uses the 2.3&nbsp;GHz [[S band]] in North America, in other parts of the world, it uses the 1.4&nbsp;GHz [[L band]] allocated for DAB. [[Image:PANTALLA DE PLASMA.JPG|thumb|upright=0.7|Television receiver]]\n\n====Television broadcasting====\n[[Television broadcasting]] is the transmission of moving images by radio, which consist of sequences of still images, which are displayed on a screen on a [[television receiver]] (a \"television\" or TV) along with a synchronized audio (sound) channel.  Television ([[video signal|video]]) signals occupy a wider [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] than broadcast radio ([[audio signal|audio]]) signals.  [[Analog television]], the original television technology, required 6&nbsp;MHz, so the television frequency bands are divided into 6&nbsp;MHz channels, now called \"RF channels\".  The current television standard, introduced beginning in 2006, is a digital format called [[high definition television|HDTV]] (high definition television), which transmits pictures at higher resolution, typically 1080 [[pixel]]s high by 1920 pixels wide, at a rate of 25 or 30 frames per second.  [[Digital television]] (DTV) transmission systems, which replaced older analog television in a [[Digital television transition|transition]] beginning in 2006, use [[image compression]] and high efficiency digital modulation such as [[orthogonal frequency division multiplexing|OFDM]] and [[8VSB]] to transmit HDTV video within a smaller bandwidth than the old analog channels, saving scarce [[radio spectrum]] space.  Therefore, each of the 6&nbsp;MHz analog RF channels now carries up to 7 DTV channels \u2013 these are called \"virtual channels\". Digital television receivers have a different behavior in the presence of poor reception or noise than analog television, called the \"[[digital cliff]]\" effect.  Unlike analog television, in which increasingly poor reception causes the picture quality to gradually degrade, in digital television picture quality is not affected by poor reception until, at a certain point, the receiver stops working and the screen goes black.\n\n[[Terrestrial television]], ''over-the-air (OTA) television'', or ''broadcast television'' \u2013 the oldest television technology, is the transmission of television signals from land-based [[television station]]s to [[television receiver]]s (called ''televisions'' or TVs) in viewer's homes.  Terrestrial television broadcasting uses the bands 41 \u2013 88&nbsp;MHz ([[VHF]] low band or [[Band I]], carrying RF channels 1\u20136), 174 \u2013 240&nbsp;MHz, (VHF high band or [[Band III]]; carrying RF channels 7\u201313), and 470 \u2013 614&nbsp;MHz ([[UHF]] [[Band IV]] and [[Band V]]; carrying RF channels 14 and up).  The exact frequency boundaries vary in different countries.  Propagation is by [[line-of-sight propagation|line-of-sight]], so reception is limited by the visual horizon to {{convert|30-40|miles|km|sigfig=2}}.   In the US [[effective radiated power]] (ERP) of television transmitters is limited to 35&nbsp;kW in the VHF low band, 50&nbsp;kW in the VHF high band, and 220&nbsp;kW in UHF band; most TV stations operate below 75% of the limit.  In most areas viewers use a simple \"rabbit ears\" [[dipole antenna]] on top of the TV, but viewers in [[fringe reception]] areas more than 15 miles from a station usually have to use an outdoor antenna mounted on the roof to get adequate reception.   [[Image:SuperDISH121.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|[[Satellite dish|Satellite television dish]] on a residence]]\n\n[[Satellite television]] \u2013 a [[set-top box]] which receives subscription [[direct-broadcast satellite television]], and displays it on an ordinary [[television]]. A [[direct broadcast satellite]] in [[geostationary]] orbit {{convert|22200|mi|km|sigfig=3}} above the Earth's [[equator]] transmits many channels (up to 900) modulated on a 12.2 to 12.7&nbsp;GHz [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub> band]] [[microwave]] [[downlink]] signal to a rooftop [[satellite dish]] antenna on the subscriber's residence.  The microwave signal is converted to a lower [[intermediate frequency]] at the dish and conducted into the building by a coaxial cable to a [[set-top box]] connected to the subscriber's TV, where it is demodulated and displayed. The subscriber pays a monthly fee.\n\n====Time and frequency====\nGovernment [[standard frequency and time signal service]]s operate time radio stations which continuously broadcast extremely accurate time signals produced by [[atomic clock]]s, as a reference to synchronize other clocks.  Examples are [[BPC (time signal)|BPC]], [[DCF77]], [[JJY]], [[Time from NPL (MSF)|MSF]], [[RTZ (radio station)|RTZ]], [[TDF time signal|TDF]], [[WWV (radio station)|WWV]], and [[YVTO]].  One use is in [[radio clock]]s and watches, which include an automated receiver which periodically (usually weekly) receives and decodes the time signal and resets the watch's internal [[quartz clock]] to the correct time, thus allowing a small watch or desk clock to have the same accuracy as an atomic clock.  Government time stations are declining in number because [[global positioning system|GPS]] satellites and the Internet [[Network Time Protocol]] (NTP) provide equally accurate time standards.\n\n===Two way voice communication===\n{{main|Two-way radio}}\n{{multiple image\n| align= right\n| direction= horizontal\n| image1= HA0478-006 (6011470974).jpg\n| caption1= \n| width1= 140\n| image2= Cell-Tower.jpg\n| caption2= \n| width2= 108\n| footer= ''(left)'' Modern cellphone.

An older term for this mode of communication is ''[[radiotelephony]]''.  The radio link may be [[half-duplex]], as in a [[walkie-talkie]], using a single radio channel in which only one radio can transmit at a time, so different users take turns talking, pressing a \"[[push to talk]]\" button on their radio which switches off the receiver and switches on the transmitter.  Or the radio link may be [[full duplex]], a bidirectional link using two radio channels so both people can talk at the same time, as in a cell phone.\n*[[Cell phone]] \u2013 a portable wireless [[telephone]] that is connected to the [[public switched telephone network|telephone network]] by radio signals exchanged with a local antenna at a [[cellular base station]] ([[cell tower]]).<ref name=\"HowCellPhonesWork\">{{cite web\n  | last1 = Brain\n  | first1 = Marshall; Jeff Tyson & Julia Layton\n  | title = How Cell Phones Work\n  | work = How Stuff Works\n  | publisher =  InfoSpace Holdings LLC\n  | date = 2018\n  | url = https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/cell-phone.htm\n  | doi = \n  | accessdate = 31 December 2018}}</ref> The service area covered by the provider is divided into small geographical areas called \"cells\", each served by a separate base station antenna and multichannel [[transceiver]].  All the cell phones in a cell communicate with this antenna on separate frequency channels, assigned from a common pool of frequencies.\n\n:The purpose of cellular organization is to conserve radio bandwidth by [[frequency reuse]].  Low power transmitters are used so the radio waves used in a cell do not travel far beyond the cell, allowing the same frequencies to be reused in geographically separated cells.  When a user carrying a cellphone crosses from one cell to another, his phone is automatically \"handed off\" seamlessly to the new antenna and assigned new frequencies.  Cellphones have a highly automated [[full duplex]] digital [[transceiver]] using [[orthogonal frequency division multiplexing|OFDM]] modulation using two digital radio channels, each carrying one direction of the bidirectional conversation, as well as a control channel that handles dialing calls and \"handing off\" the phone to another cell tower.  Existing [[2G]], [[3G]], and [[4G]] networks use frequencies in the [[ultrahigh frequency|UHF]] and low microwave range, between 700&nbsp;MHz and 3&nbsp;GHz.  The cell phone transmitter adjusts its power output to use the minimum power necessary to communicate with the cell tower; 0.6&nbsp;W when near the tower, up to 3&nbsp;W when farther away.  Cell tower channel transmitter power is 50&nbsp;W.  Current generation phones, called [[smartphone]]s, have many functions besides making telephone calls, and therefore have several other radio transmitters and receivers that connect them with other networks: usually a [[wireless modem|WiFi modem]], a [[Bluetooth]] modem, and a [[GPS receiver]]. \n**[[5G|5G cellular network]] \u2013 next generation cellular networks which began deployment in 2019.  Their major advantage is much higher data rates than previous cellular networks, up to 10&nbsp;[[bits per second|Gbps]]; 100 times faster than the previous cellular technology, [[4G LTE]].    The higher [[data signaling rate|data rates]] are achieved by using higher frequency radio waves in or near the [[millimeter wave]] band, around 28 and 39&nbsp;GHz.  Since millimeter waves are absorbed by atmospheric gases they have shorter range than microwaves.  Therefore 5G cells will be the size of a city block, smaller than the cells in previous cellular networks which could be many miles across.  Instead of a large [[cell site|cell base station]] and antenna tower, 5G networks will have many small antennas attached to utility poles and buildings.\n\n[[Image:Zivile Satellitentelefone.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Satellite phones, showing the large antennas needed to communicate with the satellite]]\n\n*[[Satellite phone]] (''satphone'') \u2013 a portable wireless [[telephone]] similar to a cell phone, connected to the [[public switched telephone network|telephone network]] through a radio link to an orbiting [[communications satellite]] instead of through [[cell tower]]s.  They are more expensive than cell phones; but their advantage is that, unlike a cell phone which is limited to areas covered by cell towers, satphones can be used over most or all of the geographical area of the Earth.  In order for the phone to communicate with a satellite using a small [[omnidirectional antenna]], first generation systems use satellites in [[low earth orbit]], about {{convert|400-700|mi|km|sigfig=2}} above the surface.  With an orbital period of about 100 minutes a satellite can only be in view of a phone for about 4 \u2013 15 minutes, so the call is \"handed off\" to another satellite when one passes beyond the local horizon. Therefore, large numbers of satellites, about 40 to 70, are required to ensure that at least one satellite is in view continuously from each point on Earth.  Other satphone systems use satellites in [[geostationary orbit]] in which only a few satellites are needed, but these cannot be used at high latitudes because of terrestrial interference.\n*[[Cordless phone]]- a [[landline telephone]] in which the [[handset]] is portable and communicates with the rest of the phone by a short range [[duplex (telecommunications)|full duplex]] radio link, instead of being attached by a cord.  Both the handset and the base station have low power FM radio transceivers operating in the [[ultrahigh frequency|UHF]] band that handle the short range bidirectional radio link.  \n[[Image:Faster communications aid Marine, civilian first responders 130827-M-KX456-009.jpg|thumb|Firefighter using walkie-talkie]]\n*[[Land mobile radio system]] \u2013 short range mobile or portable [[half-duplex]] radio transceivers operating in the VHF or UHF band that can be used without a license.  They are often installed in vehicles, with the mobile units communicating with a dispatcher at a fixed [[base station]].  Special systems with reserved frequencies are used by [[first responder]] services; police, fire, ambulance, and emergency services and other government services.  Other systems are made for use by commercial firms such as taxi and delivery services.  VHF systems use channels in the range 30\u201350&nbsp;MHz and 150\u2013172&nbsp;MHz.  UHF systems use the 450\u2013470&nbsp;MHz band and in some areas the 470\u2013512&nbsp;MHz range.  In general, VHF systems have longer range than UHF but require longer antennas. AM or FM modulation is mainly used, but digital systems such as [[Digital mobile radio|DMR]] are being introduced.  Radiated power is typically limited to 4 watts.<ref name=\"HowCellPhonesWork\" /> These systems have a fairly limited range, usually {{convert|3 to 20|miles|km|sigfig=2}} depending on terrain. [[Repeater]]s installed on tall buildings, hills or mountain peaks are often used to increase the range, when it is desired to cover a larger area than line-of-sight.  Examples of land mobile systems are [[Citizens Band|CB]], [[Family Radio Service|FRS]], [[General Mobile Radio Service|GMRS]], and [[Multi-Use Radio Service|MURS]].  Modern digital systems, called [[trunked radio system]]s, have a digital channel management system using a control channel which automatically assigns frequency channels to user groups.    \n**[[Walkie-talkie]] \u2013 a battery powered portable handheld half-duplex two-way radio, used in land mobile radio systems.  \n*[[Airband]] \u2013 Half-duplex radio system used by aircraft pilots to talk to other aircraft and ground-based [[air traffic controller]]s.

For most communication in overland flights in [[air corridor]]s a VHF-AM system using channels between 108\u2013137&nbsp;MHz in the [[very high frequency|VHF]] band are used.   This system has a typical transmission range of {{convert|200|miles|km|sigfig=2}} for aircraft flying at cruising altitude. For flights in more remote areas, such as transoceanic airline flights, aircraft use the [[high frequency|HF]] band or channels on the [[Inmarsat]] or [[Iridium]] satphone satellites.   Military aircraft also use a dedicated UHF-AM band from 225.0\u2013399.95&nbsp;MHz.\n[[Image:Radio-Telephone.jpg|thumb|VHF marine radio on a ship]]\n*[[Marine radio]] \u2013 medium range transceivers on ships, used for ship-to-ship, ship-to-air and ship-to-shore communication with [[harbormaster]]s They use FM channels between 156 and 174&nbsp;MHz in the [[very high frequency|VHF]] band with up to 25 watts power, giving them a range of about {{convert|60|miles|km|sigfig=2}}.  Some channels are [[half-duplex]] and some are [[full-duplex]], to be compatible with the telephone network, to allow users to make telephone calls through a marine operator.\n*[[Amateur radio]] \u2013 long range half-duplex two way radio used by hobbyists for noncommercial purposes: recreational radio contacts with other amateurs, volunteer emergency communication during disasters, contests, and experimentation. [[Radio amateur]]s must hold an [[amateur radio license]] and are given a unique [[callsign]] that must be used as an identifier in transmissions.   Amateur radio is restricted to small frequency bands, the [[amateur radio band]]s, spaced throughout the radio spectrum from 136&nbsp;kHz to 2.4&nbsp;GHz.  Within these bands amateurs are allowed freedom to transmit on any frequency with a wide variety of modulation methods.  In addition to [[radiotelephony]], amateurs are the only radio operators still using obsolete [[Morse code]] [[radiotelegraphy]].\n\n===One way voice communication===\nOne way, unidirectional radio transmission is called ''[[simplex communication|simplex]]''.  \n*[[Baby monitor]] \u2013  this is a cribside appliance for parents of infants that transmits the baby's sounds to a receiver carried by the parent, so they can monitor the baby while they are in other parts of the house.  These transmit in FM on 49.300, 49.830, 49.845, 49.860, or 49.875&nbsp;MHz with low power.   Many baby monitors have duplex channels so the parent can talk to the baby, and video cameras to show a picture of the baby, this is called a ''baby cam''.\n*[[Wireless microphone]] \u2013 a battery powered [[microphone]] with a short-range transmitter which is handheld or worn on a person's body which transmits its sound by radio to a nearby receiver unit connected to a sound system.  Wireless microphones are used by public speakers, performers, and television personalities so they can move freely without trailing a microphone cord.  Analog models transmit in FM on unused portions of the television broadcast frequencies in the VHF and UHF bands.  Some models transmit on two frequency channels for [[diversity reception]] to prevent [[null (radio)|nulls]] from interrupting transmission as the performer moves around.  Some models use digital modulation to prevent unauthorized reception by scanner radio receivers; these operate in the 900&nbsp;MHz, 2.4&nbsp;GHz or 6&nbsp;GHz [[ISM bands]].\n\n===Data communications===\n{{main|Data communications}}\n*[[Wireless networking]] \u2013 automated radio links which transmit digital data between [[computer]]s and other wireless devices using radio waves, linking the devices together transparently in a [[computer network]].   Computer networks can transmit any form of data: in addition to email and web pages, they also carry [[phone call]]s ([[VoIP]]), audio, and video content (called [[streaming media]]).   Security is more of an issue for wireless networks than for wired networks since anyone nearby with a wireless modem can access the signal and attempt to log in. The radio signals of wireless networks are [[encryption|encrypted]] using [[Wi-Fi Protected Access|WPA]].  [[File:Wireless network.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Laptop computer and typical home [[wireless router]] ''(right)'' connecting it to the Internet]] \n**[[Wireless LAN]] (''wireless local area network'' or ''[[WiFi]]'') \u2013 based on the [[IEEE 802.11]] standards, these are the most widely used computer networks, used to implement [[local area network]]s without cables, linking computers, laptops, cell phones, [[video game console]]s, [[smart TV]]s and [[computer printer|printers]] in a home or office together, and to a [[wireless router]] connecting them to the [[Internet]] with a wire or cable connection.  Wireless routers in public places like libraries, hotels and coffee shops create [[wireless access points]] ([[hotspot (Wi-Fi)|hotspots]]) to allow the public to access the Internet with portable devices like [[smartphone]]s, [[tablet computer|tablets]] or [[laptop computer|laptops]].  Each device exchanges data using a [[wireless network interface controller|wireless modem]] (wireless network interface controller), an automated [[microwave]] transmitter and receiver with an [[omnidirectional antenna]] that works in the background, exchanging [[data packet]]s with the router.  WiFi uses channels in the 2.4&nbsp;GHz and 5&nbsp;GHz [[ISM band]]s with OFDM ([[orthogonal frequency division multiplexing]]) modulation to transmit data at high rates.  The transmitters in Wifi modems are limited to a radiated power of 200&nbsp;mW to 1&nbsp;watt, depending on country. They have a maximum indoor range of about {{convert|150|ft|m|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} on 2.4&nbsp;GHz and {{convert|50|ft|m|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} on 5&nbsp;GHz.  [[File:USI router.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Neighborhood wireless WAN router on telephone pole]]\n**[[Wireless WAN]] (wireless wide area network, WWAN) \u2013 a variety of technologies that provide wireless internet access over a wider area than Wifi networks do \u2013 from an office building, to a campus, to a neighborhood, to an entire city.  The most common technologies used are: [[cellular modem]]s, that exchange computer data by radio with [[cell tower]]s; satellite internet access; and lower frequencies in the UHF band, which have a longer range than WiFi frequencies.  Since WWAN networks are much more expensive and complicated to administer than WiFi networks, their use so far has generally been limited to private networks operated by large corporations.  \n**[[Bluetooth]] \u2013 a very short range wireless interface on a portable wireless device used as a substitute for a wire or cable connection, mainly to exchange files between portable devices and connect cellphones and music players with wireless [[headphone]]s.  In the most widely used mode, transmission power is limited to 1&nbsp;milliwatt, giving it a very short range of up to 10 m (30 feet).  The system uses [[frequency-hopping spread spectrum]] transmission, in which successive [[data packet]]s are transmitted in a pseudorandom order on one of 79 1&nbsp;MHz Bluetooth channels between 2.4\u20132.83&nbsp;GHz in the [[ISM band]].  This allows Bluetooth networks to operate in the presence of [[radio noise|noise]], other wireless devices and other Bluetooth networks using the same frequencies, since the chance of another device attempting to transmit on the same frequency at the same time as the Bluetooth modem is low.  In the case of such a \"collision\" the Bluetooth modem just retransmits the data packet on another frequency.\n**[[Packet radio]] \u2013 a long-distance [[peer-to-peer]] [[wireless ad-hoc network]] in which [[data packet]]s are exchanged between computer controlled [[radio modem]]s (transmitter/receivers) called nodes, which may be separated by miles, and may be mobile.  Each node only communicates with neighboring nodes, so packets of data are passed from node to node until they reach their destination.  Uses the [[X.25]] network protocol. Packet radio systems are used to a limited degree by commercial telecommunications companies and by the [[amateur radio]] community.\n*[[Text messaging]] (texting) \u2013 this is a service on [[cell phone]]s, allowing a user to type a short alphanumeric message and send it to another phone number, and the text is displayed on the recipient's phone screen.  It is based on the [[Short Message Service]] (SMS) which transmits using spare bandwidth on the control radio channel used by cell phones to handle background functions like dialing and cell handoffs. Due to technical limitations of the channel, text messages are limited to 160 alphanumeric characters.\n\n[[Image:Parabolic antennas.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Parabolic antenna]]s of microwave relay links on tower in Australia. ]]\n\n*[[Microwave relay]] \u2013 a long distance high bandwidth point-to-point digital data transmission link consisting of a microwave transmitter connected to a [[parabolic antenna|dish antenna]] that transmits a beam of [[microwaves]] to another dish antenna and receiver. Since the antennas must be in line-of-sight, distances are limited by the visual horizon to {{convert|30-40|miles|km|sigfig=2}}. Microwave links are used for private business data, wide area computer networks (WANs), and by telephone companies to transmit long distance phone calls and television signals between cities.\n*[[Telemetry]] \u2013 automated one-way (simplex) transmission of measurements and operation data from a remote process or device to a receiver for monitoring.  Telemetry is used for in-flight monitoring of missiles, drones, satellites, and [[weather balloon]] [[radiosonde]]s, sending scientific data back to Earth from interplanetary spacecraft, communicating with electronic biomedical sensors implanted in the human body, and [[well logging]]. Multiple channels of data are often transmitted using [[frequency division multiplexing]] or [[time division multiplexing]]. Telemetry is starting to be used in consumer applications such as:  \n**[[Automated meter reading]] \u2013 [[electricity meter|electric power meters]], [[water meter]]s, and [[gas meter]]s that, when triggered by an interrogation signal, transmit their readings by radio to a utility reader vehicle at the curb, to eliminate the need for an employee to go on the customer's property to manually read the meter.\n**[[Electronic toll collection]] \u2013 on [[toll road]]s, an alternative to manual collection of tolls at a toll booth, in which a [[transponder]] in a vehicle, when triggered by a roadside transmitter, transmits a signal to a roadside receiver to register the vehicle's use of the road, enabling the owner to be billed for the toll. \n[[Image:RFID Chip 001.JPG|thumb|upright=0.6|RFID tag from a DVD]]\n*[[Radio Frequency Identification]] (RFID) \u2013 identification tags containing a tiny radio [[transponder]] ([[Radio receiver|receiver]] and [[transmitter]]) which are attached to merchandise.  When it receives an interrogation pulse of radio waves from a nearby reader unit, the tag transmits back an ID number, which can be used to inventory goods.  Passive tags, the most common type, have a chip powered by the radio energy received from the reader, rectified by a diode, and can be as small as a grain of rice.    They are incorporated in products, clothes, railroad cars, library books, airline baggage tags and are implanted under the skin in pets and livestock ([[microchip implant (animal)|microchip implant]]) and even people. Privacy concerns have been addressed with tags that use [[encryption|encrypted]] signals and [[authentication|authenticate]] the reader before responding.  Passive tags use 125\u2013134&nbsp;kHz, 13, 900&nbsp;MHz and 2.4 and 5&nbsp;GHz [[ISM band]]s and have a short range.    Active tags, powered by a battery, are larger but can transmit a stronger signal, giving them a range of hundreds of meters.   \n*[[Communication with submarines|Submarine communication]] \u2013 When submerged, [[submarine]]s are cut off from all ordinary radio communication with their military command authorities by the conductive seawater.  However radio waves of low enough frequencies, in the [[very low frequency|VLF]] (30 to 3&nbsp;kHz) and [[extremely low frequency|ELF]] (below 3&nbsp;kHz) bands are able to penetrate seawater.  Navies operate large shore transmitting stations with power output in the megawatt range to transmit [[encryption|encrypted]] messages to their submarines in the world's oceans.  Due to the small bandwidth, these systems cannot transmit voice, only text messages at a slow data rate. The communication channel is one-way, since the long antennas needed to transmit VLF or ELF waves cannot fit on a submarine.  [[Very low frequency|VLF]] transmitters use miles long wire antennas like [[umbrella antenna]]s.     A few nations use [[Extremely low frequency|ELF]] transmitters operating around 80&nbsp;Hz, which can communicate with submarines at lower depths.  These use even larger antennas called [[ground dipole]]s, consisting of two [[ground (electricity)|ground]] (Earth) connections {{convert|23-60|km|miles|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} apart, linked by overhead transmission lines to a power plant transmitter.\n\n===Space communication===\n[[Image:\u0426\u041a\u0421 \u0414\u0443\u0431\u043d\u0430 \u0413\u041f\u041a\u0421 -6.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Russian [[satellite ground station]] ]]\nThis is radio communication between a [[spacecraft]] and an Earth-based ground station, or another spacecraft.  \nCommunication with spacecraft involves the longest transmission distances of any radio links, up to billions of kilometers for [[interplanetary spaceflight|interplanetary spacecraft]].  In order to receive the weak signals from distant spacecraft, [[satellite ground station]]s use large [[parabolic antenna|parabolic \"dish\" antennas]] up to {{convert|25|m|ft|sigfig=2}} in diameter and extremely sensitive receivers. High frequencies in the [[microwave]] band are used, since microwaves pass through the [[ionosphere]] without [[refraction]], and at microwave frequencies the [[high gain antenna]]s needed to focus the radio energy into a narrow beam pointed at the receiver are small and take up a minimum of space in a satellite. Portions of the [[ultrahigh frequency|UHF]], [[L band|L]], [[C band (IEEE)|C]], [[S band|S]], [[ku band|k<sub>u</sub>]] and [[ka band|k<sub>a</sub> band]] are allocated for space communication.   A radio link which transmits data from the Earth's surface to a spacecraft is called an [[uplink]], while a link which transmits data from the spacecraft to the ground is called a [[downlink]].\n\n[[Image:Az\u0259rbaycan peyki - VOA.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Communications satellite belonging to [[Azerbaijan]] ]]\n*[[Communication satellite]] \u2013 an [[artificial satellite]] used as a telecommunications relay to transmit data between widely separated points on Earth.  These are used because the [[microwave]]s used for telecommunications travel by [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]] and so cannot propagate around the curve of the Earth.  There are currently over 2000 communication satellites in orbit around the Earth.  Most are in [[geostationary]] orbit {{convert|22200|mi|km|sigfig=3}} above the [[equator]], so that the satellite appears stationary at the same point in the sky, so the [[satellite dish]] antennas of ground stations can be aimed permanently at that spot and do not have to move to track it.  In a [[satellite ground station]] a microwave transmitter and large [[satellite dish]] antenna transmits a microwave uplink beam to the satellite.  The uplink signal carries many channels of telecommunications traffic, such as long distance telephone calls, television programs, and internet signals, using a technique called [[frequency-division multiplexing]] (FDM).  On the satellite a [[transponder (satellite communications)|transponder]] receives the signal, translates it to a different downlink frequency to avoid interfering with the uplink signal, and retransmits it down to another ground station, which may be widely separated from the first.  There the downlink signal is demodulated and the telecommunications traffic it carries is sent to its local destinations through landlines.  Communication satellites typically have several dozen transponders on different frequencies, which are leased by different users.  \n*[[Direct broadcast satellite]] \u2013 a geostationary communication satellite that transmits retail programming directly to receivers in subscriber's homes and vehicles on Earth, in [[satellite radio]] and TV systems.  It uses a higher transmitter power than other communication satellites, to allow the signal to be received by consumers with a small unobtrusive antenna.  For example, [[satellite television]] uses downlink frequencies from 12.2 to 12.7&nbsp;GHz in the [[ku band|k<sub>u</sub> band]] transmitted at 100 to 250 watts, which can be received by relatively small {{convert|43-80|cm|inch|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} [[satellite dish]]es mounted on the outside of buildings.\n\n===Radar===\n{{main|Radar}}\n[[Image:US Navy 120208-N-TU894-022 Air-Traffic Controller 2nd Class Gregory Clemmons stands the departure position watch as Air-Traffic Controller 3rd Clas.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Military [[air traffic controller]] on US Navy aircraft carrier monitors aircraft on radar screen ]]\n\n[[Radar]] is a [[radiolocation]] method used to locate and track aircraft, spacecraft, missiles, ships, vehicles, and also to map weather patterns and terrain. A radar set consists of a transmitter and receiver.  The transmitter emits a narrow beam of radio waves which is swept around the surrounding space.  When the beam strikes a target object, radio waves are reflected back to the receiver.  The direction of the beam reveals the object's location.  Since radio waves travel at a constant speed close to the [[speed of light]], by measuring the brief time delay between the outgoing pulse and the received \"echo\", the range to the target can be calculated.  The targets are often displayed graphically on a map display called a ''radar screen''.   [[Doppler radar]] can measure a moving object's velocity, by measuring the change in frequency of the return radio waves due to the [[Doppler effect]].\n\nRadar sets mainly use high frequencies in the [[microwave]] bands, because these frequencies create strong reflections from objects the size of vehicles and can be focused into narrow beams with compact antennas.  [[Parabolic antenna|Parabolic (dish) antennas]] are widely used.  In most radars the transmitting antenna also serves as the receiving antenna; this is called a ''[[monostatic radar]]''.  A radar which uses separate transmitting and receiving antennas is called a ''[[bistatic radar]]''.\n\n[[Image:ASR-9 Radar Antenna.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|ASR-8 airport surveillance radar antenna.  It rotates once every 4.8 seconds.  The rectangular antenna on top is the secondary radar.]]\n\n*[[Airport surveillance radar]] \u2013 In [[aviation]], radar is the main tool of [[air traffic control]].  A rotating dish antenna sweeps a vertical fan-shaped beam of microwaves around the airspace and the radar set shows the location of aircraft as \"blips\" of light on a display called a radar screen.  Airport radar operates at 2.7 \u2013 2.9&nbsp;GHz in the microwave [[S band]].  In large airports the radar image is displayed on multiple screens in an operations room called the TRACON ([[Terminal Radar Approach Control]]), where [[air traffic controller]]s direct the aircraft by radio to maintain safe aircraft separation.\n**[[Secondary surveillance radar]] \u2013 Aircraft carry [[transponder (aeronautics)|radar transponders]], transceivers which when triggered by the incoming radar signal transmit a return microwave signal.   This causes the aircraft to show up more strongly on the radar screen.  The radar which triggers the transponder and receives the return beam, usually mounted on top of the primary radar dish, is called the [[secondary surveillance radar]].  Since radar cannot measure an aircraft's altitude with any accuracy, the transponder also transmits back the aircraft's altitude measured by its [[altimeter]], and an ID number identifying the aircraft, which is displayed on the radar screen.\n*[[Electronic countermeasures]] (ECM) \u2013 Military defensive electronic systems designed to degrade enemy radar effectiveness, or deceive it with false information, to prevent enemies from locating local forces.   It often consists of powerful microwave transmitters that can mimic enemy radar signals to create false target indications on the enemy radar screens.  \n*[[Radar altimeter]] \u2013 a specialized radar on an aircraft that measures the altitude of the aircraft above terrain by bouncing a radio beam off the ground surface and measuring the time for the echo to return.\n\n[[File:Rotating marine radar - rotating waveguide antenna.gif|thumb|upright=0.7|Rotating marine radar antenna on ship.]]\n\n*[[Marine radar]] \u2013 an [[X band]] radar on ships used to detect nearby ships and obstructions like bridges.  A rotating antenna sweeps a vertical fan-shaped beam of microwaves around the water surface surrounding the craft out to the horizon.  \n*[[Weather radar]] \u2013 A [[Doppler radar]] which maps weather systems and measures wind speeds by reflection of microwaves from raindrops. \n*[[Phased-array radar]] \u2013 a radar set that uses a [[phased array]], a computer-controlled antenna that can steer the radar beam quickly to point in different directions without moving the antenna.  Phased-array radars were developed by the military to track fast-moving missiles and aircraft.  They are widely used in military equipment and are now spreading to civilian applications.\n*[[Synthetic aperture radar]](SAR) \u2013 a specialized airborne radar set that produces a high-resolution map of ground terrain.  The radar is mounted on an aircraft or spacecraft and the radar antenna radiates a beam of radio waves sideways at right angles to the direction of motion, toward the ground.  In processing the return radar signal, the motion of the vehicle is used to simulate a large antenna, giving the radar a higher resolution.\n*[[Ground-penetrating radar]] \u2013 a specialized radar instrument which is rolled along the ground surface in a cart and transmits a beam of radio waves into the ground, producing an image of subsurface objects.  Frequencies from 100&nbsp;MHz to a few GHz are used.  Since radio waves cannot penetrate very far into earth, the depth of GPR is limited to about 50 feet.\n*[[Collision avoidance system]] \u2013 a short range radar or [[LIDAR]] system on an automobile or vehicle that detects if the vehicle is about to collide with an object and applies the brakes to prevent the collision.\n*[[Fuze#Proximity fuze|Radar fuze]] \u2013 a [[detonator]] for an [[aerial bomb]] which uses a radar altimeter to measure the height of the bomb above the ground as it falls and detonates it at a certain altitude.  \n*[[Radar speed gun]] \u2013 A handheld [[Doppler radar]] used by traffic police to measure the speed of vehicles to determine if they are obeying the local [[speed limit]].  When the officer points the gun at a vehicle and presses a trigger, its speed appears on a numeric display.  Speed guns use the [[X band]] or [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub> band]].\n\n===Radiolocation===\n{{main|Radiolocation}}\nRadiolocation is a generic term covering a variety of techniques which use radio waves to find the location of objects, or for navigation\n[[Image:Paris-PorteMolitor-GPS.jpg|thumb|A [[personal navigation assistant]] [[GPS receiver]] in a car, which can give driving directions to a destination.]]\n\n*[[GNSS|Global Navigation Satellite System]] (GNSS) or ''satnav system'' \u2013 A system of satellites which allows geographical location on Earth ([[latitude]], [[longitude]], and altitude/elevation) to be determined to high precision (within a few metres) by small portable navigation instruments, by timing the arrival of radio signals from the satellites.  These are the most widely used navigation systems today.  The main satellite navigation systems are the US [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS), [[Russia]]'s [[GLONASS]], [[China]]'s [[BeiDou Navigation Satellite System]] (BDS) and the [[European Union]]'s [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]].\n**[[Global Positioning System]](GPS) \u2013 The most widely used satellite navigation system, maintained by the US Air Force, which uses a constellation of 31 satellites in [[low Earth orbit]].  The orbits of the satellites are distributed so at any time at least four satellites are above the horizon over each point on Earth.   Each satellite has an onboard [[atomic clock]] and transmits a continuous radio signal containing a precise time signal as well as its current position. Two frequencies are used, 1.2276 and 1.57542&nbsp;GHz. Since the velocity of radio waves is virtually constant, the delay of the radio signal from a satellite is proportional to the distance of the receiver from the satellite.  By receiving the signals from at least four satellites a [[GPS receiver]] can calculate its position on Earth by comparing the arrival time of the radio signals.     Since each satellite's position is known precisely at any given time, from the delay the position of the receiver can be calculated by a microprocessor in the receiver. The position can be displayed as latitude and longitude, or as a marker on an electronic map.   GPS receivers are incorporated in almost all cellphones and in vehicles such as automobiles, aircraft, and ships, and are used to guide [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drones]], [[missile]]s, [[cruise missile]]s, and even [[artillery shell]]s to their target, and handheld GPS receivers are produced for hikers and the military.\n*[[Radio beacon]] \u2013 a fixed location terrestrial radio transmitter which transmits a continuous radio signal used by aircraft and ships for [[navigation]].  The locations of beacons are plotted on navigational maps used by aircraft and ships.[[Image:D-VOR PEK.JPG|thumb|VOR/DME aircraft radio navigation beacon]]\n**[[VHF Omnidirectional Range|Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range]] (VOR) \u2013 a worldwide aircraft [[radio navigation]] system consisting of fixed ground [[radio beacon]]s transmitting between 108.00 and 117.95&nbsp;MHz in the [[very high frequency|VHF]] band.  An automated navigational instrument on the aircraft displays a [[bearing (navigation)|bearing]] to a nearby VOR transmitter. A VOR beacon transmits two signals simultaneously on different frequencies.  A [[directional antenna]] transmits a beam of radio waves that rotates like a lighthouse at a fixed rate, 30 times per second. When the directional beam is facing north, an [[omnidirectional antenna]] transmits a pulse. By measuring the difference in [[phase (waves)|phase]] of these two signals, an aircraft can determine its [[bearing (navigation)|bearing]] (or \"radial\") from the station accurately.   By taking a bearing on two VOR beacons an aircraft can determine its position (called a \"fix\") to an accuracy of about {{convert|90|m|ft|sigfig=2}}.  Most VOR beacons also have a distance measuring capability, called [[distance measuring equipment]] (DME); these are called VOR/DME's.  The aircraft transmits a radio signal to the VOR/DME beacon and a [[transponder]] transmits a return signal.  From the [[propagation delay]] between the transmitted and received signal the aircraft can calculate its distance from the beacon.  This allows an aircraft to determine its location \"fix\" from only one VOR beacon.  Since line-of-sight VHF frequencies are used VOR beacons have a range of about 200 miles for aircraft at cruising altitude.  [[TACAN]] is a similar military radio beacon system which transmits in 962\u20131213&nbsp;MHz, and a combined VOR and TACAN beacon is called a [[VORTAC]].    In 2000 there were about 3000 VOR beacons worldwide, but this number is declining as aviation switches to the [[RNAV]] system that relies on [[Global Positioning System]] satellite navigation.\n**[[Non-directional beacon]] (NDB) \u2013 Legacy fixed radio beacons used before the VOR system that transmit a simple signal in all directions for aircraft or ships to use for [[radio direction finding]].   Aircraft use [[automatic direction finder]] (ADF) receivers which use a [[directional antenna]] to determine the [[bearing (navigation)|bearing]] to the beacon.  By taking bearings on two beacons they can determine their position.  NDBs use frequencies between 190 and 1750&nbsp;kHz in the [[Low frequency|LF]] and [[Medium frequency|MF]] bands which propagate beyond the horizon as [[ground wave]]s or [[skywave]]s much farther than VOR beacons.  They transmit a [[callsign]] consisting of one to 3 [[Morse code]] letters as an identifier.  [[Image:EPIRB (1).jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|EPIRB emergency locator beacon on a ship]]\n*[[Emergency locator beacon]] \u2013 a portable battery powered [[radio transmitter]] used in emergencies to locate airplanes, vessels, and persons in distress and in need of immediate rescue.  Various types of emergency locator beacons are carried by aircraft, ships, vehicles, hikers and cross-country skiers.  In the event of an emergency, such as the aircraft crashing, the ship sinking, or a hiker becoming lost, the transmitter is deployed and begins to transmit a continuous radio signal, which is used by [[search and rescue]] teams to quickly find the emergency and render aid.  The latest generation [[Emergency Position Indicating Rescue Beacon]]s (EPIRBs) contain a [[GPS receiver]], and broadcast to rescue teams their exact location within 20 meters. \n**[[International Cospas-Sarsat Programme|Cospas-Sarsat]] \u2013 an international humanitarian consortium of governmental and private agencies which acts as a dispatcher for [[search and rescue]] operations.  It operates a network of about 47 [[satellite]]s carrying radio receivers, which detect distress signals from [[emergency locator beacon]]s anywhere on Earth transmitting on the international Cospas distress frequency of 406&nbsp;MHz.  The satellites calculate the geographic location of the beacon within 2&nbsp;km by measuring the [[Doppler shift|Doppler frequency shift]] of the radio waves due to the relative motion of the transmitter and the satellite, and quickly transmit the information to the appropriate local [[first responder]] organizations, which perform the [[search and rescue]].   \n[[File:Tracking Mountain Lions.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Wildlife officer tracking radio tagged mountain lion]]    \n*[[Radio direction finding]] (RDF) \u2013 this is a general technique, used since the early 1900s, of using specialized radio receivers with [[directional antenna]]s (RDF receivers) to determine the exact [[bearing (navigation)|bearing]] of a radio signal, to determine the location of the transmitter.  The location of a terrestrial transmitter can be determined by simple [[triangulation]] from bearings taken by two RDF stations separated geographically, as the point where the two bearing lines cross, this is called a \"fix\".  Military forces use RDF to locate enemy forces by their tactical radio transmissions, [[counterintelligence]] services use it to locate clandestine transmitters used by [[espionage|espionage agent]]s, and governments use it to locate unlicensed transmitters or interference sources.  Older RDF receivers used rotatable [[loop antenna]]s, the antenna is rotated until the radio signal strength is weakest, indicating the transmitter is in one of the antenna's two [[null (radio)|null]]s.  The nulls are used since they are sharper than the antenna's [[main lobe|lobes]] (maxima).   More modern receivers use [[phased array]] antennas which have much greater angular resolution.\n**[[Animal migration tracking]] \u2013 a widely used technique in [[wildlife biology]], [[conservation biology]], and [[wildlife management]] in which small battery-powered radio transmitters are attached to [[wild animal]]s so their movements can be tracked with a directional [[radio direction finding|RDF]] receiver. Sometimes the transmitter is implanted in the animal.  The VHF band is typically used since antennas in this band are fairly compact.  The receiver has a [[directional antenna]] (typically a small [[Yagi antenna|Yagi]]) which is rotated until the received signal is strongest; at this point the antenna is pointing in the direction of the animal.  Sophisticated systems used in recent years use satellites to track the animal, or [[geolocation]] tags with [[global positioning system|GPS]] receivers which record and transmit a log of the animal's location.\n\n===Remote control===\n{{main|Radio control}}\n\n[[Image:MQ-1 Predator unmanned aircraft.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|US Air Force [[MQ-1 Predator]] drone flown remotely by a pilot on the ground]]\nRadio remote control is the use of electronic [[control signal]]s sent by radio waves from a transmitter to control the actions of a device at a remote location.  Remote control systems may also include [[telemetry]] channels in the other direction, used to transmit real-time information of the state of the device back to the control station.  Unmanned [[spacecraft]] are an example of remote controlled machines, controlled by commands transmitted by [[satellite ground station]]s.  Most handheld [[remote control]]s used to control [[consumer electronics]] products like televisions or DVD players actually operate by [[infrared light]] rather than radio waves, so are not examples of radio remote control.  A security concern with remote control systems is [[spoofing attack|spoofing]], in which an unauthorized person transmits an imitation of the control signal to take control of the device.  Examples of radio remote control:\n*[[Unmanned aerial vehicle]] (UAV, drone) \u2013 A drone is an aircraft without an onboard pilot, flown by remote control by a pilot in another location, usually in a piloting station on the ground.  They are used by the military for reconnaissance and ground attack, and more recently by the civilian world for news reporting and [[aerial photography]].   The pilot uses aircraft controls like a joystick or steering wheel, which create control signals which are transmitted to the drone by radio to control the flight surfaces and engine.  A [[telemetry]] system transmits back a video image from a camera in the drone to allow the pilot to see where he is going, and data from a [[GPS receiver]] giving the real-time position of the aircraft.  UAVs have sophisticated onboard [[automatic pilot]] systems that maintain stable flight and only require manual control to change directions.\n\n[[Image:Automobile remote keyless entry transmitter.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Remote keyless entry fob for a car]] \n*[[Keyless entry system]]  \u2013 a short-range handheld battery powered [[key fob]] transmitter, included with most modern cars, which can lock and unlock the doors of a vehicle from outside, eliminating the need to use a key.  When a button is pressed, the transmitter sends a coded radio signal to a receiver in the vehicle, operating the locks.  The fob must be close to the vehicle, typically within 5 to 20 meters.  North America and Japan use a frequency of 315&nbsp;MHz, while Europe uses 433.92 and 868&nbsp;MHz.  Some models can also remotely start the engine, to warm up the car.  A security concern with all keyless entry systems is a [[replay attack]], in which a thief uses a special receiver (\"code grabber\") to record the radio signal during opening, which can later be replayed to open the door.  To prevent this, keyless systems use a [[rolling code]] system in which a [[pseudorandom number generator]] in the remote control generates a different random key each time it is used.  To prevent thieves from simulating the pseudorandom generator to calculate the next key, the radio signal is also [[encryption|encrypted]].\n**[[Garage door opener]] \u2013 a short-range handheld transmitter which can open or close a building's electrically operated [[garage door]] from outside, so the owner can open the door when he drives up in his car, and close it after he leaves.  When a button is pressed the control transmits a coded [[Frequency-shift keying|FSK]] radio signal to a receiver in the opener, raising or lowering the door.  Modern openers use 310, 315 or 390&nbsp;MHz.  To prevent a thief using a [[replay attack]], modern openers use a [[rolling code]] system.\n\n[[Image:Md4-200.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Quadcopter]], a popular remote-controlled toy]]\n*[[Radio-controlled model]]s \u2013 a popular hobby is playing with radio-controlled model boats, cars, airplanes, and helicopters ([[quadcopter]]s) which are controlled by radio signals from a handheld console with a [[joystick]].  Most recent transmitters use the 2.4&nbsp;GHz [[ISM band]] with multiple control channels modulated with [[pulse width modulation|PWM]], [[pulse code modulation|PCM]] or [[frequency-shift keying|FSK]].\n*[[Doorbell|Wireless doorbell]] \u2013 A residential [[doorbell]] that uses wireless technology to eliminate the need to run wires through the building walls.  It consists of a doorbell button beside the door containing a small battery powered transmitter.  When the doorbell is pressed it sends a signal to a receiver inside the house with a speaker that sounds chimes to indicate someone is at the door.  They usually use the 2.4&nbsp;GHz [[ISM band]].  The frequency channel used can usually be changed by the owner in case another nearby doorbell is using the same channel.\n{{breakafterimages}}\n\n===Jamming===\n[[Radio jamming]] is the deliberate radiation of radio signals designed to interfere with the reception of other radio signals.  Jamming devices are called \"signal suppressors\" or \"interference generators\" or just jammers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ajax.systems/blog/what-is-jamming/|title=What jamming of a wireless security system is and how to resist it {{!}} Ajax Systems Blog|website=Ajax Systems|language=en|access-date=2020-01-18}}</ref>\n\nDuring wartime, militaries use jamming to interfere with enemies' tactical radio communication. Since radio waves can pass beyond national borders, some [[totalitarian]] countries which practice [[censorship]] use jamming to prevent their citizens from listening to broadcasts from radio stations in other countries. Jamming is usually accomplished by a powerful transmitter which generates noise on the same frequency as the target transmitter.\n\nUS Federal law prohibits the operation or sale of any type of jamming devices, including ones that interfere with GPS, cellular, Wi-Fi and police radars.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fcc.gov/general/jammer-enforcement|title=Jammer Enforcement|date=2011-03-03|website=Federal Communications Commission|language=en|access-date=2020-01-18}}</ref>\n\n===Scientific research===\n\n[[Image:The Arecibo Observatory 20151101114231-0 8e7cc c7a44aca orig.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Arecibo Observatory|Arecibo radio telescope]], in Puerto Rico]]\n*[[Radio astronomy]] is the scientific study of radio waves emitted by astronomical objects.  Radio astronomers use [[radio telescope]]s, large radio antennas and receivers, to receive and study the radio waves from [[astronomical radio source]]s.  Since astronomical radio sources are so far away, the radio waves from them are extremely weak, requiring extremely sensitive receivers, and radio telescopes are the most sensitive radio receivers in existence.  They use large [[parabolic antenna|parabolic (dish) antennas]] up to {{convert|500|meters|feet|sigfig=1}} in diameter to collect enough radio wave energy to study.  The [[RF front end]] electronics of the receiver is often cooled by [[liquid nitrogen]] to reduce [[thermal noise]].   Multiple antennas are often linked together in arrays which function as a single antenna, to increase collecting power.  In [[VLBI|Very Long Baseline Interferometry]] (VLBI) radio telescopes on different continents are linked, which can achieve the resolution of an antenna thousands of miles in diameter.  \n*[[Remote sensing]] \u2013 in radio, remote sensing is the reception of electromagnetic waves radiated by natural objects or the atmosphere for scientific research.  All warm objects emit [[microwave]]s and the spectrum emitted can be used to determine temperature.  [[Microwave radiometer]]s are used in [[meteorology]] and [[earth science]]s to determine temperature of the atmosphere and earth surface, as well as chemical reactions in the atmosphere.\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Primary sources|section|date=December 2019}}\nThe word \"radio\" is derived from the Latin word \"radius\", meaning \"spoke of a wheel, beam of light, ray\". It was first applied to communications in 1881 when, at the suggestion of French scientist [[:fr:Ernest Mercadier|Ernest Mercadier]], [[Alexander Graham Bell]] adopted \"radiophone\" (meaning \"radiated sound\") as an alternate name for his [[photophone]] optical transmission system.<ref>\"Production of Sound by Radiant Energy\" by Alexander Graham Bell, ''Popular Science Monthly'', July, 1881, pages 329\u2013330: \"[W]e have named the apparatus for the production and reproduction of sound in this way the \"photophone\", ''because an ordinary beam of light contains the rays which are operative.'' To avoid in future any misunderstandings upon this point, we have decided to adopt the term \"''radiophone''\", proposed by M. Mercadier, as a general term signifying the production of sound by any form of radiant energy...\"</ref> However, this invention would not be widely adopted.\n\nFollowing [[Heinrich Hertz]]'s discovery of the existence of [[radio waves]] in 1886, a variety of terms were initially used for this radiation, including \"Hertzian waves\", \"electric waves\", and \"ether waves\".  The first practical radio communications systems, developed by [[Guglielmo Marconi]] in 1894\u20135, transmitted [[telegraph]] signals by radio waves, so radio communication was first called \"[[wireless telegraphy]]\".  Up until about 1910 the term \"wireless telegraphy\" also included a variety of other experimental systems for transmitting telegraph signals without wires, including [[electrostatic induction]], [[electromagnetic induction]] and [[Electrical conductor|aquatic and earth conduction]], so there was a need for a more precise term referring exclusively to electromagnetic radiation.\n\nThe first use of ''radio-'' in conjunction with electromagnetic radiation appears to have been by French physicist [[\u00c9douard Branly]], who in 1890 developed the [[coherer]] detector, which he called in French a ''[[:fr:radioconducteur|radio-conducteur]]''.<ref>\"The Genesis of Wireless Telegraphy\" by [[Archie Frederick Collins|A. Frederick Collins]], ''Electrical World and Engineer'', May 10, 1902, page 811.</ref> The radio- prefix was later used to form additional descriptive compound and hyphenated words, especially in Europe. For example, in early 1898 the British publication ''The Practical Engineer'' included a reference to \"the radiotelegraph\" and \"radiotelegraphy\",<ref>\"Wireless Telegraphy\", ''The Practical Engineer'', February 25, 1898, page 174. \"Dr. O. J. Lodge, who preceded Marconi in making experiments in what may be called \"ray\" telegraphy or radiotelegraphy by a year or two, has devised a new method of sending and receiving the messages. The reader will understand that in the radiotelegraph electric waves forming the signals of the message start from the sending instrument and travel in all directions like rays of light from a lamp, only they are invisible.\"</ref> The French text of both the 1903 and 1906 Berlin Radiotelegraphic Conventions includes the phrases \"radiot\u00e9l\u00e9graphique\" and \"radiot\u00e9l\u00e9grammes\".\n\nThe use of \"radio\" as a standalone word dates back to at least December 30, 1904, when instructions issued by the British Post Office for transmitting telegrams specified that \"The word 'Radio'... is sent in the Service Instructions\".<ref>\"Wireless Telegraphy\", ''The Electrical Review'' (London), January 20, 1905, page 108, quoting from the British Post Office's December 30, 1904 ''Post Office Circular''.</ref> This practice was universally adopted, and the word \"radio\" introduced internationally, by the 1906 Berlin Radiotelegraphic Convention, which included a Service Regulation specifying that \"Radiotelegrams shall show in the preamble that the service is 'Radio'\".\n\nThe switch to \"radio\" in place of \"wireless\" took place slowly and unevenly in the English-speaking world. [[Lee de Forest]] helped popularize the new word in the United States\u2014in early 1907 he founded the DeForest Radio Telephone Company, and his letter in the June 22, 1907 ''Electrical World'' about the need for legal restrictions warned that \"Radio chaos will certainly be the result until such stringent regulation is enforced\".<ref>\"Interference with Wireless Messages\", ''Electrical World'', June 22, 1907, page 1270.</ref> The United States Navy would also play a role. Although its translation of the 1906 Berlin Convention used the terms \"wireless telegraph\" and \"wireless telegram\", by 1912 it began to promote the use of \"radio\" instead. The term started to become preferred by the general public in the 1920s with the introduction of broadcasting. (the word ''broadcasting'' originated with the agricultural term meaning roughly \"scattering seeds widely\".) British Commonwealth countries continued to commonly use the term \"wireless\" until the mid-20th century, though the magazine of the [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]] in the UK has been called ''[[Radio Times]]'' since its founding in the early 1920s.\n\nIn recent years \"wireless\" has gained renewed popularity as a more general term for devices communicating using electromagnetic radiation, either radio waves or light, due to the rapid growth of short-range computer networking, e.g., [[Wireless LAN|wireless local area network]]s [[Wi-Fi]], and Bluetooth, as well as cell phones, to distinguish these uses from traditional \"radio\" communication, such as broadcasting.\n\n==History==\n:''See'' [[History of radio]], [[Invention of radio]], [[Timeline of radio]], [[History of broadcasting]]\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Radio}}\n* [[Outline of radio]]\n* [[Electromagnetic radiation and health]]\n* [[Radio quiet zone]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons+cat|Radio|Radio}}\n{{Wikiquote}}\n\n{{Morse code}}\n{{Telecommunications}}\n{{Audio broadcasting}}\n{{Radio spectrum}}\n{{Media culture}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Advertising by medium]]\n[[Category:Radio| ]]\n[[Category:British inventions]]\n[[Category:Italian inventions]]\n[[Category:Media formats]]\n[[Category:Promotion and marketing communications]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Radio towers on Sandia Peak - closeup.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|A variety of radio [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]s on [[Sandia Crest|Sandia peak]] near [[Albuquerque]], New Mexico, US.

They are generated by an electronic device called a [[transmitter]] connected to an [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] which radiates the waves, and received by a [[radio receiver]] connected to another antenna. Radio is very widely used in modern technology, in radio communication, [[radar]], [[radio navigation]], [[remote control]], [[remote sensing]] and other applications.\n\nIn '''radio communication''', used in [[radio broadcasting|radio]] and [[television broadcasting]], [[cell phone]]s, [[two-way radio]]s, [[wireless networking]] and [[satellite communication]] among numerous other uses, radio waves are used to carry information across space from a transmitter to a receiver, by [[modulating]] the radio signal (impressing an information signal on the radio wave by varying some aspect of the wave) in the transmitter. In [[radar]], used to locate and track objects like aircraft, ships, spacecraft and missiles, a beam of radio waves emitted by a radar transmitter reflects off the target object, and the reflected waves reveal the object's location.   In [[radio navigation]] systems such as [[global positioning system|GPS]] and [[VHF omnidirectional range|VOR]], a mobile receiver receives radio signals from [[radio beacon|navigational radio beacons]] whose position is known, and by precisely measuring the arrival time of the radio waves the receiver can calculate its position on Earth. In wireless [[radio control|radio remote control]] devices like [[drone (aircraft)|drone]]s, [[garage door opener]]s, and [[keyless entry system]]s, radio signals transmitted from a controller device control the actions of a remote device.\n\nApplications of radio waves which do not involve transmitting the waves significant distances, such as [[RF heating]] used in industrial processes and [[microwave oven]]s, and medical uses such as [[diathermy]] and [[MRI machine]]s, are not usually called ''radio''.  The noun ''radio'' is also used to mean a [[radio receiver|broadcast radio receiver]].\n\nRadio waves were first identified and studied by German physicist [[Heinrich Hertz]] in 1886. The first practical radio transmitters and receivers were developed around 1895-6 by Italian [[Guglielmo Marconi]], and radio began to be used commercially around 1900. To prevent interference between users, the emission of radio waves is strictly regulated by law, coordinated by an international body called the [[International Telecommunications Union]] (ITU), which allocates frequency bands in the [[radio spectrum]] for different uses.\n\n==Radio technology==\nRadio waves are radiated by [[electric charge]]s undergoing [[acceleration]].<ref name=\"Kraus\">{{cite book\n | last1  = Kraus\n | first1 = John D.\n | title  = Antennas, 2nd Ed.\n | publisher = Tata-McGraw Hill\n | date   = 1988\n | pages  = 50\n | url    = https://archive.org/details/Antennas2ndbyjohnD.Kraus1988/page/n75\n | doi    = \n | id     = \n | isbn   = 0074632191\n }}</ref><ref name=\"Serway\">{{cite book|last1=Serway|first1=Raymond|last2=Faughn|first2=Jerry|last3=Vuille|first3=Chris|title=College Physics, 8th Ed.|publisher=Cengage Learning|date=2008|pages=714|language=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CX0u0mIOZ44C&pg=PA714&dq=%22electromagnetic+wave%22+charge+acceleration|doi=|id=|isbn=0495386936}}</ref> They are generated artificially by time varying [[electric current]]s, consisting of [[electron]]s flowing back and forth in a metal conductor called an [[antenna (radio)|antenna]],<ref name=\"Balanis\">{{cite book\n | last1  = Balanis\n | first1 = Constantine A.\n | title  = Antenna theory: Analysis and Design, 3rd Ed.\n | publisher = John Wiley and Sons\n | date   = 2005\n | pages  = [https://archive.org/details/Antenna.Theory.Analysis.and.Design3rd.Edition/page/n22 10]\n | url    = https://archive.org/details/Antenna.Theory.Analysis.and.Design3rd.Edition\n | doi    = \n | id     = \n | isbn   = 9781118585733\n }}</ref><ref name=\"Ellingson2\">{{cite book|last1=Ellingson|first1=Steven W.|title=Radio Systems Engineering|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=2016|pages=16\u201317|language=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QMKSDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA16&dq=%22radio+wave%22+time+varying+electric+current|doi=|id=|isbn=1316785165}}</ref> thus accelerating.  In transmission, a [[transmitter]] generates an [[alternating current]] of [[radio frequency]] which is applied to an antenna. The antenna radiates the power in the current as radio waves. When the waves strike the antenna of a [[radio receiver]], they push the electrons in the metal back and forth, inducing a tiny alternating current. The radio receiver connected to the receiving antenna detects this oscillating current and amplifies it.\n\nAs they travel farther from the transmitting antenna, radio waves spread out so their [[signal strength]] ([[intensity (physics)|intensity]] in watts per square meter) decreases, so radio transmissions can only be received within a limited range of the transmitter, the distance depending on the transmitter power, antenna [[radiation pattern]], receiver sensitivity, noise level, and presence of obstructions between transmitter and receiver.  An [[omnidirectional antenna]] transmits or receives radio waves in all directions, while a [[directional antenna]] or [[high gain antenna]] transmits radio waves in a beam in a particular direction, or receives waves from only one direction.\n\nRadio waves travel through a vacuum at the [[speed of light]], and in air at very close to the speed of light, so the [[wavelength]] of a radio wave, the distance in meters between adjacent crests of the wave, is inversely proportional to its [[frequency]].\n\nThe other types of [[electromagnetic wave]]s besides radio waves; [[infrared]], [[visible light]], [[ultraviolet]], [[X-ray]]s and [[gamma rays]], are also able to carry information and be used for communication.  The wide use of radio waves for telecommunication is mainly due to their desirable [[radio propagation|propagation]] properties stemming from their large [[wavelength]].<ref name=\"Ellingson2\" />  Radio waves have the ability to pass through the atmosphere, foliage, and most building materials, and by [[diffraction]] can bend around obstructions, and unlike other electromagnetic waves they tend to be scattered rather than absorbed by objects larger than their wavelength.  \n\n===Radio communication===\n[[File:Signal processing system.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Radio communication.  Information such as sound is converted by a transducer such as a [[microphone]] to an electrical signal, which modulates a [[radio wave]] produced by the [[transmitter]]. A receiver intercepts the radio wave and extracts the information-bearing modulation signal, which is converted back to a human usable form with another transducer such as a [[loudspeaker]].]]\n[[File:Amfm3-en-de.gif|thumb|Comparison of AM and FM modulated radio waves]]\n\nIn radio communication systems, information is carried across space using radio waves.  At the sending end, the information to be sent is converted by some type of [[transducer]] to a time-varying [[electrical signal]] called the modulation signal.<ref name=\"Ellingson2\" /><ref name=\"HowStuffWorks\">{{cite web|url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/radio8.htm|title=How Radio Works|first=Marshall|last=Brain|publisher=HowStuffWorks.com|date=2000-12-07|accessdate=2009-09-11}}</ref> The modulation signal may be an [[audio signal]] representing sound from a [[microphone]], a [[video signal]] representing moving images from a [[video camera]], or a [[digital signal]] consisting of a sequence of [[binary digit|bits]] representing binary data from a computer.  The modulation signal is applied to a [[radio transmitter]].  In the transmitter, an [[electronic oscillator]] generates an [[alternating current]] oscillating at a [[radio frequency]], called the ''[[carrier wave]]'' because it serves to \"carry\" the information through the air.  The information signal is used to [[modulation|modulate]] the carrier, varying some aspect of the carrier wave, impressing the information on the carrier.  Different radio systems use different [[modulation]] methods:\n*AM ([[amplitude modulation]]) \u2013 in an AM transmitter, the [[amplitude]] (strength) of the radio carrier wave is varied by the modulation signal.  \n*FM ([[frequency modulation]]) \u2013 in an FM transmitter, the [[frequency]] of the radio carrier wave is varied by the modulation signal.\n*FSK ([[frequency shift keying]]) \u2013 used in wireless digital devices to transmit [[digital signal]]s, the [[frequency]] of the carrier wave is shifted periodically between two frequencies that represent the two [[binary digit]]s, 0 and 1, to transmit a sequence of [[binary digit|bits]].\n*OFDM ([[orthogonal frequency division multiplexing]]) \u2013 a family of complicated [[digital modulation]] methods very widely used in high bandwidth systems such as [[WiFi]] networks, [[cellphone]]s, [[digital television]] broadcasting, and [[digital audio broadcasting]] (DAB) to transmit digital data using a minimum of [[radio spectrum]] bandwidth.  It has higher [[spectral efficiency]] and more resistance to [[fading]] than AM or FM.  In OFDM, multiple radio carrier waves closely spaced in frequency are transmitted within the radio channel, with each carrier modulated with bits from the incoming [[bitstream]] so multiple [[binary digit|bits]] are being sent simultaneously, in parallel.  At the receiver, the carriers are demodulated and the bits are combined in the proper order into one bitstream.\nMany other types of modulation are also used. In some types, a carrier wave is not transmitted but just one or both modulation [[sideband]]s.  The modulated carrier is [[amplifier|amplified]] in the transmitter and applied to a transmitting [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] which radiates the energy as radio waves.   The radio waves carry the information to the receiver location.\n\nAt the receiver, the radio wave induces a tiny oscillating [[voltage]] in the receiving antenna which is a weaker replica of the current in the transmitting antenna.<ref name=\"Ellingson2\" /><ref name=\"HowStuffWorks\" /> This voltage is applied to the [[radio receiver]], which [[amplifier|amplifies]] the weak radio signal so it is stronger, then [[demodulate]]s it, extracting the original modulation signal from the modulated carrier wave.  The modulation signal is converted by a [[transducer]] back to a human-usable form: an audio signal is converted to [[sound wave]]s by a loudspeaker or earphones, a [[video signal]] is converted to images by a [[display device|display]], while a digital signal is applied to a computer or microprocessor, which interacts with human users.\n\nThe radio waves from many transmitters pass through the air simultaneously without interfering with each other because each transmitter's radio waves oscillate at a different rate, in other words, each transmitter has a different [[frequency]], measured in [[kilohertz]] (kHz), [[megahertz]] (MHz) or [[gigahertz]] (GHz).   The receiving antenna typically picks up the radio signals of many transmitters.  The receiver uses ''[[tuned circuit]]s'' to select the radio signal desired out of all the signals picked up by the antenna and reject the others.  A [[tuned circuit]] (also called resonant circuit or tank circuit) acts like a [[resonator]], similarly to a [[tuning fork]].<ref name=\"HowStuffWorks\" /> It has a natural [[resonant frequency]] at which it oscillates.  The resonant frequency of the receiver's tuned circuit is adjusted by the user to the frequency of the desired radio station; this is called \"tuning\".  The oscillating radio signal from the desired station causes the tuned circuit to [[resonance|resonate]], oscillate in sympathy, and it passes the signal on to the rest of the receiver.  Radio signals at other frequencies are blocked by the tuned circuit and not passed on.\n\n===Bandwidth===\n[[File:Modulated radio signal frequency spectrum.svg|thumb|[[Frequency]] spectrum of a typical modulated AM or FM radio signal.  It consists of a component ''C'' at the [[carrier wave]] frequency <math>f_c</math> with the information ([[modulation]]) contained in two narrow bands of frequencies called [[sideband]]s (''SB'') just above and below the carrier frequency. ]]\n\nA modulated radio wave, carrying an information signal, occupies a range of [[frequency|frequencies]].  See diagram.  The information ([[modulation]]) in a radio signal is usually concentrated in narrow frequency bands called [[sideband]]s (''SB'') just above and below the [[carrier wave|carrier]] frequency.  The width in [[hertz]] of the frequency range that the radio signal occupies, the highest frequency minus the lowest frequency, is called its [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] (''BW'').<ref name=\"Spectrum101\">{{cite paper\n  | title = Spectrum 101\n  | version = \n  | publisher = US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)\n  | date = February 2016\n  | url = https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/spectrum_101.pdf\n  | format = \n  | accessdate = 2 December 2019}}, p. 6</ref>  For any given [[signal-to-noise ratio]], an amount of bandwidth can carry the same amount of information ([[data signaling rate|data rate]] in [[binary digit|bits]] per second) regardless of where in the radio frequency spectrum it is located, so bandwidth is a measure of [[channel capacity|information-carrying capacity]]. The bandwidth required by a radio transmission depends on the data rate of the information (modulation signal) being sent, and the [[spectral efficiency]] of the [[modulation]] method used; how much data it can transmit in each kilohertz of bandwidth.  Different types of information signals carried by radio have different data rates.  For example, a television (video) signal has a greater data rate than an [[audio signal]].\n\nThe [[radio spectrum]], the total range of radio frequencies that can be used for communication in a given area, is a limited resource.<ref name=\"Spectrum101\" /><ref name=\"Ellingson1\" /> Each radio transmission occupies a portion of the total bandwidth available.  Radio bandwidth is regarded as an [[economic good]] which has a monetary cost and is in increasing demand.  In some parts of the radio spectrum the right to use a frequency band or even a single radio channel is bought and sold for millions of dollars.  So there is an incentive to employ technology to minimize the bandwidth used by radio services.\n\nIn recent years there has been a transition from [[analog signal|analog]] to [[digital signal|digital]] radio transmission technologies.  Part of the reason for this is that [[digital modulation]] can often transmit more information (a greater data rate) in a given bandwidth than [[analog modulation]], by using [[data compression]] algorithms, which reduce redundancy in the data to be sent, and more efficient modulation.  Other reasons for the transition is that digital modulation has greater [[noise immunity]] than analog, [[digital signal processing]] chips have more power and flexibility than analog circuits, and a wide variety of types of information can be transmitted using the same digital modulation.\n\nBecause it is a fixed resource which is in demand by an increasing number of users, the [[radio spectrum]] has become increasingly congested in recent decades, and the need to use it more effectively is driving many additional radio innovations such as [[trunked radio system]]s, [[spread spectrum]] (ultra-wideband) transmission, [[frequency reuse]], [[dynamic spectrum management]], frequency pooling, and [[cognitive radio]].\n\n===ITU frequency bands===\nThe [[International Telecommunications Union|ITU]] arbitrarily divides the [[radio spectrum]] into 12 bands, each beginning at a [[wavelength]] which is a power of ten (10<sup>n</sup>)&nbsp;metres, with corresponding frequency of 3 times a power of ten, and each covering a decade of frequency or wavelength.<ref name=\"Ellingson1\" /><ref name=\"ITU2016\">{{cite paper\n  | title = Radio Regulations, 2016 Edition\n  | version = \n  | publisher = International Telecommunications Union\n  | date = 3 November 2016\n  | url = https://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-r/opb/reg/R-REG-RR-2016-ZPF-E.zip\n  | format = PDF\n  | accessdate = 9 November 2019 }} Article 2, Section 1, p.27</ref>  Each of these bands has a traditional name:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"text-align:left;\" \n!

The greater bandwidth available has motivated a continuing trend to exploit higher frequencies throughout radio's history.\n\n==Regulation==\nThe airwaves are a resource shared by many users.  Two radio transmitters in the same area that attempt to transmit on the same frequency will interfere with each other, causing garbled reception, so neither transmission may be received clearly.<ref name=\"Spectrum101\" /> [[radio frequency interference|Interference]] with radio transmissions can not only have a large economic cost, it can be life-threatening (for example, in the case of interference with emergency communications or [[air traffic control]]).\n\nTo prevent interference between different users, the emission of radio waves is strictly regulated by national laws, coordinated by an international body, the [[International Telecommunications Union]] (ITU), which allocates bands in the [[radio spectrum]] for different uses.<ref name=\"Spectrum101\" /><ref name=\"Ellingson1\" /> Radio transmitters must be licensed by governments, under a variety of license classes depending on use, and are restricted to certain frequencies and power levels.  In some classes, such as radio and television broadcasting stations, the transmitter is given a unique identifier consisting of a string of letters and numbers called a ''[[call sign]]'', which must be used in all transmissions.  The radio operator must hold a government license, such as the [[general radiotelephone operator license]] in the US, obtained by taking a test demonstrating adequate technical and legal knowledge of safe radio operation.\n\nExceptions to the above rules allow the unlicensed operation by the public of low power short range transmitters in consumer products such as [[cell phone]]s, [[cordless phone]]s, [[wireless device]]s, [[walkie-talkie]]s, [[citizens band radio]]s, [[wireless microphone]]s, [[garage door opener]]s, and [[baby monitor]]s. In the US, these fall under [[Part 15]] of the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) regulations.   Many of these devices use the [[ISM band]]s, a series of frequency bands throughout the radio spectrum reserved for unlicensed use.  Although they can be operated without a license, like all radio equipment these devices generally must be [[Type approval|type-approved]] before sale.\n\n==Applications==\nBelow are some of the most important uses of radio, organized by function.\n\n===Broadcasting===\n{{main|Broadcasting}}\n{{multiple image\n| direction = horizontal\n| total_width = 350\n| image1   = 2008-07-28 Mast radiator.jpg\n| caption1 = AM radio station\n| image2   = FM broadcasting antenna Willans Hill.jpg\n| caption2 = FM radio station\n| image3   = Superturnstile Tx Muehlacker.JPG\n| caption3 = Television station\n| footer   = Broadcasting antennas\n}}\n[[Broadcasting]] is the one-way transmission of information from a radio transmitter to receivers belonging to a public audience. Since the radio waves become weaker with distance, a [[broadcasting station]] can only be received within a limited distance of its transmitter.  Systems which broadcast from [[communication satellite|satellites]] can generally be received over an entire country or continent.  Older terrestrial radio and television is paid for by [[commercial advertising]] or governments.  In subscription systems like [[satellite television]] and [[satellite radio]] the customer pays a monthly fee.  In these systems the radio signal is [[encryption|encrypted]] and can only be decrypted by the receiver, which is controlled by the company and can be deactivated if the customer doesn't pay his bill.\n\nBroadcasting uses several parts of the radio spectrum, depending on the type of signals transmitted and the desired target audience. [[Longwave]] and [[medium wave]] signals can give reliable coverage of areas several hundred kilometres across, but have more limited information carrying capacity and so work best with audio signals (speech and music), and the sound quality can be degraded by [[radio noise]] from natural and artificial sources.  The [[shortwave]] bands have greater potential range, but are more subject to interference by distant stations and varying atmospheric conditions that affect reception.\n\nIn the [[very high frequency]] band, greater than 30 megahertz, the Earth's atmosphere has less of an effect on the range of signals, and [[line-of-sight propagation]] becomes the principle mode. These higher frequencies permit the great bandwidth required for television broadcasting.  Since natural and artificial noise sources are less present at these frequencies, high-quality audio transmission is possible, using [[frequency modulation]].  \n[[Image:KWNR Continental 816R-5B SN 247.jpg|thumb|FM broadcast transmitter of radio station [[W:KWNR|KWNR]], Las Vegas which transmits on 95.5&nbsp;MHz with a power of 35&nbsp;kW]]\n\n====Radio broadcasting====\n[[Radio broadcasting]] means transmission of [[audio signal|audio]] (sound) to radio receivers belonging to a public audience.  Analog audio is the earliest form of radio broadcast. [[AM broadcasting]] began around 1920. [[FM broadcasting]] was introduced in the late 1930s with improved [[fidelity]].\n\n[[Digital audio broadcasting]] (DAB) debuted in some countries in 1998. It transmits audio as a [[digital signal]] rather than an [[analog signal]] as AM and FM do.  DAB has the potential to provide higher quality sound than FM (although many stations do not choose to transmit at such high quality), has greater immunity to [[radio noise]] and interference, makes better use of scarce [[radio spectrum]] bandwidth, and provides advanced user features such as [[electronic program guide]]s.  Its disadvantage is that it is incompatible with previous radios so that a new DAB receiver must be purchased.   Most countries plan an eventual switchover from FM to DAB.  The United States and Canada have chosen not to implement DAB.\n\nA single DAB station transmits a 1,500&nbsp;kHz bandwidth signal that carries from 9 to 12 channels of digital audio modulated by [[orthogonal frequency division multiplexing|OFDM]] from which the listener can choose.  Broadcasters can transmit a channel at a range of different [[bit rate]]s, so different channels can have different audio quality.   In different countries DAB stations broadcast in either [[Band III]] (174\u2013240&nbsp;MHz) or [[L band]] (1.452\u20131.492&nbsp;GHz) in the UHF range, so like FM reception is limited by the visual horizon to about {{convert|40|miles|km|sigfig=2}}.\n\n[[Digital Radio Mondiale]] (DRM) is a competing digital terrestrial radio standard developed mainly by broadcasters as a higher [[spectral efficiency]] replacement for legacy AM and FM broadcasting.  ''Mondiale'' means \"worldwide\" in French and Italian, and DRM, developed in 2001, is currently supported by 23 countries and has been adopted by some European and Eastern broadcasters beginning in 2003. The DRM30 mode uses the AM broadcast bands below 30&nbsp;MHz and is intended as a replacement for AM and shortwave broadcasting, and the DRM+ mode uses [[very high frequency|VHF]] frequencies centered on the FM broadcast band and is intended as a replacement for FM broadcasting.  It is incompatible with existing radio receivers and requires listeners to purchase a new DRM receiver. The modulation used is a form of [[orthogonal frequency division multiplexing|OFDM]] called [[COFDM]] in which up to 4 carriers are transmitted in a channel formerly occupied by a single AM or FM signal, modulated by [[quadrature amplitude modulation]] (QAM).  The DRM system is designed to be as compatible as possible with existing AM and FM radio transmitters, so much of the equipment in existing radio stations will not have to be replaced.\n\n[[Satellite radio]] is a subscription radio service that broadcasts CD quality [[digital audio]] direct to subscribers' receivers using a [[microwave]] [[downlink]] signal from a [[communications satellite|direct broadcast communication satellite]] in [[geostationary]] orbit 22,000 miles above the Earth.  It is mostly intended for [[car radio]]s in vehicles.   Satellite radio uses the 2.3&nbsp;GHz [[S band]] in North America, in other parts of the world, it uses the 1.4&nbsp;GHz [[L band]] allocated for DAB. [[Image:PANTALLA DE PLASMA.JPG|thumb|upright=0.7|Television receiver]]\n\n====Television broadcasting====\n[[Television broadcasting]] is the transmission of moving images by radio, which consist of sequences of still images, which are displayed on a screen on a [[television receiver]] (a \"television\" or TV) along with a synchronized audio (sound) channel.  Television ([[video signal|video]]) signals occupy a wider [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] than broadcast radio ([[audio signal|audio]]) signals.  [[Analog television]], the original television technology, required 6&nbsp;MHz, so the television frequency bands are divided into 6&nbsp;MHz channels, now called \"RF channels\".  The current television standard, introduced beginning in 2006, is a digital format called [[high definition television|HDTV]] (high definition television), which transmits pictures at higher resolution, typically 1080 [[pixel]]s high by 1920 pixels wide, at a rate of 25 or 30 frames per second.  [[Digital television]] (DTV) transmission systems, which replaced older analog television in a [[Digital television transition|transition]] beginning in 2006, use [[image compression]] and high efficiency digital modulation such as [[orthogonal frequency division multiplexing|OFDM]] and [[8VSB]] to transmit HDTV video within a smaller bandwidth than the old analog channels, saving scarce [[radio spectrum]] space.  Therefore, each of the 6&nbsp;MHz analog RF channels now carries up to 7 DTV channels \u2013 these are called \"virtual channels\". Digital television receivers have a different behavior in the presence of poor reception or noise than analog television, called the \"[[digital cliff]]\" effect.  Unlike analog television, in which increasingly poor reception causes the picture quality to gradually degrade, in digital television picture quality is not affected by poor reception until, at a certain point, the receiver stops working and the screen goes black.\n\n[[Terrestrial television]], ''over-the-air (OTA) television'', or ''broadcast television'' \u2013 the oldest television technology, is the transmission of television signals from land-based [[television station]]s to [[television receiver]]s (called ''televisions'' or TVs) in viewer's homes.  Terrestrial television broadcasting uses the bands 41 \u2013 88&nbsp;MHz ([[VHF]] low band or [[Band I]], carrying RF channels 1\u20136), 174 \u2013 240&nbsp;MHz, (VHF high band or [[Band III]]; carrying RF channels 7\u201313), and 470 \u2013 614&nbsp;MHz ([[UHF]] [[Band IV]] and [[Band V]]; carrying RF channels 14 and up).  The exact frequency boundaries vary in different countries.  Propagation is by [[line-of-sight propagation|line-of-sight]], so reception is limited by the visual horizon to {{convert|30-40|miles|km|sigfig=2}}.   In the US [[effective radiated power]] (ERP) of television transmitters is limited to 35&nbsp;kW in the VHF low band, 50&nbsp;kW in the VHF high band, and 220&nbsp;kW in UHF band; most TV stations operate below 75% of the limit.  In most areas viewers use a simple \"rabbit ears\" [[dipole antenna]] on top of the TV, but viewers in [[fringe reception]] areas more than 15 miles from a station usually have to use an outdoor antenna mounted on the roof to get adequate reception.   [[Image:SuperDISH121.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|[[Satellite dish|Satellite television dish]] on a residence]]\n\n[[Satellite television]] \u2013 a [[set-top box]] which receives subscription [[direct-broadcast satellite television]], and displays it on an ordinary [[television]]. A [[direct broadcast satellite]] in [[geostationary]] orbit {{convert|22200|mi|km|sigfig=3}} above the Earth's [[equator]] transmits many channels (up to 900) modulated on a 12.2 to 12.7&nbsp;GHz [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub> band]] [[microwave]] [[downlink]] signal to a rooftop [[satellite dish]] antenna on the subscriber's residence.  The microwave signal is converted to a lower [[intermediate frequency]] at the dish and conducted into the building by a coaxial cable to a [[set-top box]] connected to the subscriber's TV, where it is demodulated and displayed. The subscriber pays a monthly fee.\n\n====Time and frequency====\nGovernment [[standard frequency and time signal service]]s operate time radio stations which continuously broadcast extremely accurate time signals produced by [[atomic clock]]s, as a reference to synchronize other clocks.  Examples are [[BPC (time signal)|BPC]], [[DCF77]], [[JJY]], [[Time from NPL (MSF)|MSF]], [[RTZ (radio station)|RTZ]], [[TDF time signal|TDF]], [[WWV (radio station)|WWV]], and [[YVTO]].  One use is in [[radio clock]]s and watches, which include an automated receiver which periodically (usually weekly) receives and decodes the time signal and resets the watch's internal [[quartz clock]] to the correct time, thus allowing a small watch or desk clock to have the same accuracy as an atomic clock.  Government time stations are declining in number because [[global positioning system|GPS]] satellites and the Internet [[Network Time Protocol]] (NTP) provide equally accurate time standards.\n\n===Two way voice communication===\n{{main|Two-way radio}}\n{{multiple image\n| align= right\n| direction= horizontal\n| image1= HA0478-006 (6011470974).jpg\n| caption1= \n| width1= 140\n| image2= Cell-Tower.jpg\n| caption2= \n| width2= 108\n| footer= ''(left)'' Modern cellphone. ''(right)'' Cellular phone tower shared by antennas belonging to 3 different networks.\n}}\n\nA [[two-way radio]] is an [[audio signal|audio]] [[transceiver]], a [[radio receiver|receiver]] and [[transmitter]] in the same device, used for bidirectional person-to-person voice communication with other users with similar radios. An older term for this mode of communication is ''[[radiotelephony]]''.  The radio link may be [[half-duplex]], as in a [[walkie-talkie]], using a single radio channel in which only one radio can transmit at a time, so different users take turns talking, pressing a \"[[push to talk]]\" button on their radio which switches off the receiver and switches on the transmitter.  Or the radio link may be [[full duplex]], a bidirectional link using two radio channels so both people can talk at the same time, as in a cell phone.\n*[[Cell phone]] \u2013 a portable wireless [[telephone]] that is connected to the [[public switched telephone network|telephone network]] by radio signals exchanged with a local antenna at a [[cellular base station]] ([[cell tower]]).<ref name=\"HowCellPhonesWork\">{{cite web\n  | last1 = Brain\n  | first1 = Marshall; Jeff Tyson & Julia Layton\n  | title = How Cell Phones Work\n  | work = How Stuff Works\n  | publisher =  InfoSpace Holdings LLC\n  | date = 2018\n  | url = https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/cell-phone.htm\n  | doi = \n  | accessdate = 31 December 2018}}</ref> The service area covered by the provider is divided into small geographical areas called \"cells\", each served by a separate base station antenna and multichannel [[transceiver]].  All the cell phones in a cell communicate with this antenna on separate frequency channels, assigned from a common pool of frequencies.\n\n:The purpose of cellular organization is to conserve radio bandwidth by [[frequency reuse]].  Low power transmitters are used so the radio waves used in a cell do not travel far beyond the cell, allowing the same frequencies to be reused in geographically separated cells.  When a user carrying a cellphone crosses from one cell to another, his phone is automatically \"handed off\" seamlessly to the new antenna and assigned new frequencies.  Cellphones have a highly automated [[full duplex]] digital [[transceiver]] using [[orthogonal frequency division multiplexing|OFDM]] modulation using two digital radio channels, each carrying one direction of the bidirectional conversation, as well as a control channel that handles dialing calls and \"handing off\" the phone to another cell tower.  Existing [[2G]], [[3G]], and [[4G]] networks use frequencies in the [[ultrahigh frequency|UHF]] and low microwave range, between 700&nbsp;MHz and 3&nbsp;GHz.  The cell phone transmitter adjusts its power output to use the minimum power necessary to communicate with the cell tower; 0.6&nbsp;W when near the tower, up to 3&nbsp;W when farther away.  Cell tower channel transmitter power is 50&nbsp;W.  Current generation phones, called [[smartphone]]s, have many functions besides making telephone calls, and therefore have several other radio transmitters and receivers that connect them with other networks: usually a [[wireless modem|WiFi modem]], a [[Bluetooth]] modem, and a [[GPS receiver]]. \n**[[5G|5G cellular network]] \u2013 next generation cellular networks which began deployment in 2019.  Their major advantage is much higher data rates than previous cellular networks, up to 10&nbsp;[[bits per second|Gbps]]; 100 times faster than the previous cellular technology, [[4G LTE]].    The higher [[data signaling rate|data rates]] are achieved by using higher frequency radio waves in or near the [[millimeter wave]] band, around 28 and 39&nbsp;GHz.  Since millimeter waves are absorbed by atmospheric gases they have shorter range than microwaves.  Therefore 5G cells will be the size of a city block, smaller than the cells in previous cellular networks which could be many miles across.  Instead of a large [[cell site|cell base station]] and antenna tower, 5G networks will have many small antennas attached to utility poles and buildings.\n\n[[Image:Zivile Satellitentelefone.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Satellite phones, showing the large antennas needed to communicate with the satellite]]\n\n*[[Satellite phone]] (''satphone'') \u2013 a portable wireless [[telephone]] similar to a cell phone, connected to the [[public switched telephone network|telephone network]] through a radio link to an orbiting [[communications satellite]] instead of through [[cell tower]]s.  They are more expensive than cell phones; but their advantage is that, unlike a cell phone which is limited to areas covered by cell towers, satphones can be used over most or all of the geographical area of the Earth.  In order for the phone to communicate with a satellite using a small [[omnidirectional antenna]], first generation systems use satellites in [[low earth orbit]], about {{convert|400-700|mi|km|sigfig=2}} above the surface.  With an orbital period of about 100 minutes a satellite can only be in view of a phone for about 4 \u2013 15 minutes, so the call is \"handed off\" to another satellite when one passes beyond the local horizon. Therefore, large numbers of satellites, about 40 to 70, are required to ensure that at least one satellite is in view continuously from each point on Earth.  Other satphone systems use satellites in [[geostationary orbit]] in which only a few satellites are needed, but these cannot be used at high latitudes because of terrestrial interference.\n*[[Cordless phone]]- a [[landline telephone]] in which the [[handset]] is portable and communicates with the rest of the phone by a short range [[duplex (telecommunications)|full duplex]] radio link, instead of being attached by a cord.  Both the handset and the base station have low power FM radio transceivers operating in the [[ultrahigh frequency|UHF]] band that handle the short range bidirectional radio link.  \n[[Image:Faster communications aid Marine, civilian first responders 130827-M-KX456-009.jpg|thumb|Firefighter using walkie-talkie]]\n*[[Land mobile radio system]] \u2013 short range mobile or portable [[half-duplex]] radio transceivers operating in the VHF or UHF band that can be used without a license.  They are often installed in vehicles, with the mobile units communicating with a dispatcher at a fixed [[base station]].  Special systems with reserved frequencies are used by [[first responder]] services; police, fire, ambulance, and emergency services and other government services.  Other systems are made for use by commercial firms such as taxi and delivery services.  VHF systems use channels in the range 30\u201350&nbsp;MHz and 150\u2013172&nbsp;MHz.  UHF systems use the 450\u2013470&nbsp;MHz band and in some areas the 470\u2013512&nbsp;MHz range.  In general, VHF systems have longer range than UHF but require longer antennas. AM or FM modulation is mainly used, but digital systems such as [[Digital mobile radio|DMR]] are being introduced.  Radiated power is typically limited to 4 watts.<ref name=\"HowCellPhonesWork\" /> These systems have a fairly limited range, usually {{convert|3 to 20|miles|km|sigfig=2}} depending on terrain. [[Repeater]]s installed on tall buildings, hills or mountain peaks are often used to increase the range, when it is desired to cover a larger area than line-of-sight.  Examples of land mobile systems are [[Citizens Band|CB]], [[Family Radio Service|FRS]], [[General Mobile Radio Service|GMRS]], and [[Multi-Use Radio Service|MURS]].  Modern digital systems, called [[trunked radio system]]s, have a digital channel management system using a control channel which automatically assigns frequency channels to user groups.    \n**[[Walkie-talkie]] \u2013 a battery powered portable handheld half-duplex two-way radio, used in land mobile radio systems.  \n*[[Airband]] \u2013 Half-duplex radio system used by aircraft pilots to talk to other aircraft and ground-based [[air traffic controller]]s.  This vital system is the main communication channel for [[air traffic control]].  For most communication in overland flights in [[air corridor]]s a VHF-AM system using channels between 108\u2013137&nbsp;MHz in the [[very high frequency|VHF]] band are used.   This system has a typical transmission range of {{convert|200|miles|km|sigfig=2}} for aircraft flying at cruising altitude. For flights in more remote areas, such as transoceanic airline flights, aircraft use the [[high frequency|HF]] band or channels on the [[Inmarsat]] or [[Iridium]] satphone satellites.   Military aircraft also use a dedicated UHF-AM band from 225.0\u2013399.95&nbsp;MHz.\n[[Image:Radio-Telephone.jpg|thumb|VHF marine radio on a ship]]\n*[[Marine radio]] \u2013 medium range transceivers on ships, used for ship-to-ship, ship-to-air and ship-to-shore communication with [[harbormaster]]s They use FM channels between 156 and 174&nbsp;MHz in the [[very high frequency|VHF]] band with up to 25 watts power, giving them a range of about {{convert|60|miles|km|sigfig=2}}.  Some channels are [[half-duplex]] and some are [[full-duplex]], to be compatible with the telephone network, to allow users to make telephone calls through a marine operator.\n*[[Amateur radio]] \u2013 long range half-duplex two way radio used by hobbyists for noncommercial purposes: recreational radio contacts with other amateurs, volunteer emergency communication during disasters, contests, and experimentation. [[Radio amateur]]s must hold an [[amateur radio license]] and are given a unique [[callsign]] that must be used as an identifier in transmissions.   Amateur radio is restricted to small frequency bands, the [[amateur radio band]]s, spaced throughout the radio spectrum from 136&nbsp;kHz to 2.4&nbsp;GHz.  Within these bands amateurs are allowed freedom to transmit on any frequency with a wide variety of modulation methods.  In addition to [[radiotelephony]], amateurs are the only radio operators still using obsolete [[Morse code]] [[radiotelegraphy]].\n\n===One way voice communication===\nOne way, unidirectional radio transmission is called ''[[simplex communication|simplex]]''.  \n*[[Baby monitor]] \u2013  this is a cribside appliance for parents of infants that transmits the baby's sounds to a receiver carried by the parent, so they can monitor the baby while they are in other parts of the house.  These transmit in FM on 49.300, 49.830, 49.845, 49.860, or 49.875&nbsp;MHz with low power.   Many baby monitors have duplex channels so the parent can talk to the baby, and video cameras to show a picture of the baby, this is called a ''baby cam''.\n*[[Wireless microphone]] \u2013 a battery powered [[microphone]] with a short-range transmitter which is handheld or worn on a person's body which transmits its sound by radio to a nearby receiver unit connected to a sound system.  Wireless microphones are used by public speakers, performers, and television personalities so they can move freely without trailing a microphone cord.  Analog models transmit in FM on unused portions of the television broadcast frequencies in the VHF and UHF bands.  Some models transmit on two frequency channels for [[diversity reception]] to prevent [[null (radio)|nulls]] from interrupting transmission as the performer moves around.  Some models use digital modulation to prevent unauthorized reception by scanner radio receivers; these operate in the 900&nbsp;MHz, 2.4&nbsp;GHz or 6&nbsp;GHz [[ISM bands]].\n\n===Data communications===\n{{main|Data communications}}\n*[[Wireless networking]] \u2013 automated radio links which transmit digital data between [[computer]]s and other wireless devices using radio waves, linking the devices together transparently in a [[computer network]].   Computer networks can transmit any form of data: in addition to email and web pages, they also carry [[phone call]]s ([[VoIP]]), audio, and video content (called [[streaming media]]).   Security is more of an issue for wireless networks than for wired networks since anyone nearby with a wireless modem can access the signal and attempt to log in. The radio signals of wireless networks are [[encryption|encrypted]] using [[Wi-Fi Protected Access|WPA]].  [[File:Wireless network.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Laptop computer and typical home [[wireless router]] ''(right)'' connecting it to the Internet]] \n**[[Wireless LAN]] (''wireless local area network'' or ''[[WiFi]]'') \u2013 based on the [[IEEE 802.11]] standards, these are the most widely used computer networks, used to implement [[local area network]]s without cables, linking computers, laptops, cell phones, [[video game console]]s, [[smart TV]]s and [[computer printer|printers]] in a home or office together, and to a [[wireless router]] connecting them to the [[Internet]] with a wire or cable connection.  Wireless routers in public places like libraries, hotels and coffee shops create [[wireless access points]] ([[hotspot (Wi-Fi)|hotspots]]) to allow the public to access the Internet with portable devices like [[smartphone]]s, [[tablet computer|tablets]] or [[laptop computer|laptops]].  Each device exchanges data using a [[wireless network interface controller|wireless modem]] (wireless network interface controller), an automated [[microwave]] transmitter and receiver with an [[omnidirectional antenna]] that works in the background, exchanging [[data packet]]s with the router.  WiFi uses channels in the 2.4&nbsp;GHz and 5&nbsp;GHz [[ISM band]]s with OFDM ([[orthogonal frequency division multiplexing]]) modulation to transmit data at high rates.  The transmitters in Wifi modems are limited to a radiated power of 200&nbsp;mW to 1&nbsp;watt, depending on country. They have a maximum indoor range of about {{convert|150|ft|m|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} on 2.4&nbsp;GHz and {{convert|50|ft|m|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} on 5&nbsp;GHz.  [[File:USI router.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Neighborhood wireless WAN router on telephone pole]]\n**[[Wireless WAN]] (wireless wide area network, WWAN) \u2013 a variety of technologies that provide wireless internet access over a wider area than Wifi networks do \u2013 from an office building, to a campus, to a neighborhood, to an entire city.  The most common technologies used are: [[cellular modem]]s, that exchange computer data by radio with [[cell tower]]s; satellite internet access; and lower frequencies in the UHF band, which have a longer range than WiFi frequencies.  Since WWAN networks are much more expensive and complicated to administer than WiFi networks, their use so far has generally been limited to private networks operated by large corporations.  \n**[[Bluetooth]] \u2013 a very short range wireless interface on a portable wireless device used as a substitute for a wire or cable connection, mainly to exchange files between portable devices and connect cellphones and music players with wireless [[headphone]]s.  In the most widely used mode, transmission power is limited to 1&nbsp;milliwatt, giving it a very short range of up to 10 m (30 feet).  The system uses [[frequency-hopping spread spectrum]] transmission, in which successive [[data packet]]s are transmitted in a pseudorandom order on one of 79 1&nbsp;MHz Bluetooth channels between 2.4\u20132.83&nbsp;GHz in the [[ISM band]].  This allows Bluetooth networks to operate in the presence of [[radio noise|noise]], other wireless devices and other Bluetooth networks using the same frequencies, since the chance of another device attempting to transmit on the same frequency at the same time as the Bluetooth modem is low.  In the case of such a \"collision\" the Bluetooth modem just retransmits the data packet on another frequency.\n**[[Packet radio]] \u2013 a long-distance [[peer-to-peer]] [[wireless ad-hoc network]] in which [[data packet]]s are exchanged between computer controlled [[radio modem]]s (transmitter/receivers) called nodes, which may be separated by miles, and may be mobile.  Each node only communicates with neighboring nodes, so packets of data are passed from node to node until they reach their destination.  Uses the [[X.25]] network protocol. Packet radio systems are used to a limited degree by commercial telecommunications companies and by the [[amateur radio]] community.\n*[[Text messaging]] (texting) \u2013 this is a service on [[cell phone]]s, allowing a user to type a short alphanumeric message and send it to another phone number, and the text is displayed on the recipient's phone screen.  It is based on the [[Short Message Service]] (SMS) which transmits using spare bandwidth on the control radio channel used by cell phones to handle background functions like dialing and cell handoffs. Due to technical limitations of the channel, text messages are limited to 160 alphanumeric characters.\n\n[[Image:Parabolic antennas.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Parabolic antenna]]s of microwave relay links on tower in Australia. ]]\n\n*[[Microwave relay]] \u2013 a long distance high bandwidth point-to-point digital data transmission link consisting of a microwave transmitter connected to a [[parabolic antenna|dish antenna]] that transmits a beam of [[microwaves]] to another dish antenna and receiver. Since the antennas must be in line-of-sight, distances are limited by the visual horizon to {{convert|30-40|miles|km|sigfig=2}}. Microwave links are used for private business data, wide area computer networks (WANs), and by telephone companies to transmit long distance phone calls and television signals between cities.\n*[[Telemetry]] \u2013 automated one-way (simplex) transmission of measurements and operation data from a remote process or device to a receiver for monitoring.  Telemetry is used for in-flight monitoring of missiles, drones, satellites, and [[weather balloon]] [[radiosonde]]s, sending scientific data back to Earth from interplanetary spacecraft, communicating with electronic biomedical sensors implanted in the human body, and [[well logging]]. Multiple channels of data are often transmitted using [[frequency division multiplexing]] or [[time division multiplexing]]. Telemetry is starting to be used in consumer applications such as:  \n**[[Automated meter reading]] \u2013 [[electricity meter|electric power meters]], [[water meter]]s, and [[gas meter]]s that, when triggered by an interrogation signal, transmit their readings by radio to a utility reader vehicle at the curb, to eliminate the need for an employee to go on the customer's property to manually read the meter.\n**[[Electronic toll collection]] \u2013 on [[toll road]]s, an alternative to manual collection of tolls at a toll booth, in which a [[transponder]] in a vehicle, when triggered by a roadside transmitter, transmits a signal to a roadside receiver to register the vehicle's use of the road, enabling the owner to be billed for the toll. \n[[Image:RFID Chip 001.JPG|thumb|upright=0.6|RFID tag from a DVD]]\n*[[Radio Frequency Identification]] (RFID) \u2013 identification tags containing a tiny radio [[transponder]] ([[Radio receiver|receiver]] and [[transmitter]]) which are attached to merchandise.  When it receives an interrogation pulse of radio waves from a nearby reader unit, the tag transmits back an ID number, which can be used to inventory goods.  Passive tags, the most common type, have a chip powered by the radio energy received from the reader, rectified by a diode, and can be as small as a grain of rice.    They are incorporated in products, clothes, railroad cars, library books, airline baggage tags and are implanted under the skin in pets and livestock ([[microchip implant (animal)|microchip implant]]) and even people. Privacy concerns have been addressed with tags that use [[encryption|encrypted]] signals and [[authentication|authenticate]] the reader before responding.  Passive tags use 125\u2013134&nbsp;kHz, 13, 900&nbsp;MHz and 2.4 and 5&nbsp;GHz [[ISM band]]s and have a short range.    Active tags, powered by a battery, are larger but can transmit a stronger signal, giving them a range of hundreds of meters.   \n*[[Communication with submarines|Submarine communication]] \u2013 When submerged, [[submarine]]s are cut off from all ordinary radio communication with their military command authorities by the conductive seawater.  However radio waves of low enough frequencies, in the [[very low frequency|VLF]] (30 to 3&nbsp;kHz) and [[extremely low frequency|ELF]] (below 3&nbsp;kHz) bands are able to penetrate seawater.  Navies operate large shore transmitting stations with power output in the megawatt range to transmit [[encryption|encrypted]] messages to their submarines in the world's oceans.  Due to the small bandwidth, these systems cannot transmit voice, only text messages at a slow data rate. The communication channel is one-way, since the long antennas needed to transmit VLF or ELF waves cannot fit on a submarine.  [[Very low frequency|VLF]] transmitters use miles long wire antennas like [[umbrella antenna]]s.     A few nations use [[Extremely low frequency|ELF]] transmitters operating around 80&nbsp;Hz, which can communicate with submarines at lower depths.  These use even larger antennas called [[ground dipole]]s, consisting of two [[ground (electricity)|ground]] (Earth) connections {{convert|23-60|km|miles|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} apart, linked by overhead transmission lines to a power plant transmitter.\n\n===Space communication===\n[[Image:\u0426\u041a\u0421 \u0414\u0443\u0431\u043d\u0430 \u0413\u041f\u041a\u0421 -6.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Russian [[satellite ground station]] ]]\nThis is radio communication between a [[spacecraft]] and an Earth-based ground station, or another spacecraft.  \nCommunication with spacecraft involves the longest transmission distances of any radio links, up to billions of kilometers for [[interplanetary spaceflight|interplanetary spacecraft]].  In order to receive the weak signals from distant spacecraft, [[satellite ground station]]s use large [[parabolic antenna|parabolic \"dish\" antennas]] up to {{convert|25|m|ft|sigfig=2}} in diameter and extremely sensitive receivers. High frequencies in the [[microwave]] band are used, since microwaves pass through the [[ionosphere]] without [[refraction]], and at microwave frequencies the [[high gain antenna]]s needed to focus the radio energy into a narrow beam pointed at the receiver are small and take up a minimum of space in a satellite. Portions of the [[ultrahigh frequency|UHF]], [[L band|L]], [[C band (IEEE)|C]], [[S band|S]], [[ku band|k<sub>u</sub>]] and [[ka band|k<sub>a</sub> band]] are allocated for space communication.   A radio link which transmits data from the Earth's surface to a spacecraft is called an [[uplink]], while a link which transmits data from the spacecraft to the ground is called a [[downlink]].\n\n[[Image:Az\u0259rbaycan peyki - VOA.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Communications satellite belonging to [[Azerbaijan]] ]]\n*[[Communication satellite]] \u2013 an [[artificial satellite]] used as a telecommunications relay to transmit data between widely separated points on Earth.  These are used because the [[microwave]]s used for telecommunications travel by [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]] and so cannot propagate around the curve of the Earth.  There are currently over 2000 communication satellites in orbit around the Earth.  Most are in [[geostationary]] orbit {{convert|22200|mi|km|sigfig=3}} above the [[equator]], so that the satellite appears stationary at the same point in the sky, so the [[satellite dish]] antennas of ground stations can be aimed permanently at that spot and do not have to move to track it.  In a [[satellite ground station]] a microwave transmitter and large [[satellite dish]] antenna transmits a microwave uplink beam to the satellite.  The uplink signal carries many channels of telecommunications traffic, such as long distance telephone calls, television programs, and internet signals, using a technique called [[frequency-division multiplexing]] (FDM).  On the satellite a [[transponder (satellite communications)|transponder]] receives the signal, translates it to a different downlink frequency to avoid interfering with the uplink signal, and retransmits it down to another ground station, which may be widely separated from the first.  There the downlink signal is demodulated and the telecommunications traffic it carries is sent to its local destinations through landlines.  Communication satellites typically have several dozen transponders on different frequencies, which are leased by different users.  \n*[[Direct broadcast satellite]] \u2013 a geostationary communication satellite that transmits retail programming directly to receivers in subscriber's homes and vehicles on Earth, in [[satellite radio]] and TV systems.  It uses a higher transmitter power than other communication satellites, to allow the signal to be received by consumers with a small unobtrusive antenna.  For example, [[satellite television]] uses downlink frequencies from 12.2 to 12.7&nbsp;GHz in the [[ku band|k<sub>u</sub> band]] transmitted at 100 to 250 watts, which can be received by relatively small {{convert|43-80|cm|inch|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} [[satellite dish]]es mounted on the outside of buildings.\n\n===Radar===\n{{main|Radar}}\n[[Image:US Navy 120208-N-TU894-022 Air-Traffic Controller 2nd Class Gregory Clemmons stands the departure position watch as Air-Traffic Controller 3rd Clas.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Military [[air traffic controller]] on US Navy aircraft carrier monitors aircraft on radar screen ]]\n\n[[Radar]] is a [[radiolocation]] method used to locate and track aircraft, spacecraft, missiles, ships, vehicles, and also to map weather patterns and terrain. A radar set consists of a transmitter and receiver.  The transmitter emits a narrow beam of radio waves which is swept around the surrounding space.  When the beam strikes a target object, radio waves are reflected back to the receiver.  The direction of the beam reveals the object's location.  Since radio waves travel at a constant speed close to the [[speed of light]], by measuring the brief time delay between the outgoing pulse and the received \"echo\", the range to the target can be calculated.  The targets are often displayed graphically on a map display called a ''radar screen''.   [[Doppler radar]] can measure a moving object's velocity, by measuring the change in frequency of the return radio waves due to the [[Doppler effect]].\n\nRadar sets mainly use high frequencies in the [[microwave]] bands, because these frequencies create strong reflections from objects the size of vehicles and can be focused into narrow beams with compact antennas.  [[Parabolic antenna|Parabolic (dish) antennas]] are widely used.  In most radars the transmitting antenna also serves as the receiving antenna; this is called a ''[[monostatic radar]]''.  A radar which uses separate transmitting and receiving antennas is called a ''[[bistatic radar]]''.\n\n[[Image:ASR-9 Radar Antenna.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|ASR-8 airport surveillance radar antenna.  It rotates once every 4.8 seconds.  The rectangular antenna on top is the secondary radar.]]\n\n*[[Airport surveillance radar]] \u2013 In [[aviation]], radar is the main tool of [[air traffic control]].  A rotating dish antenna sweeps a vertical fan-shaped beam of microwaves around the airspace and the radar set shows the location of aircraft as \"blips\" of light on a display called a radar screen.  Airport radar operates at 2.7 \u2013 2.9&nbsp;GHz in the microwave [[S band]].  In large airports the radar image is displayed on multiple screens in an operations room called the TRACON ([[Terminal Radar Approach Control]]), where [[air traffic controller]]s direct the aircraft by radio to maintain safe aircraft separation.\n**[[Secondary surveillance radar]] \u2013 Aircraft carry [[transponder (aeronautics)|radar transponders]], transceivers which when triggered by the incoming radar signal transmit a return microwave signal.   This causes the aircraft to show up more strongly on the radar screen.  The radar which triggers the transponder and receives the return beam, usually mounted on top of the primary radar dish, is called the [[secondary surveillance radar]].  Since radar cannot measure an aircraft's altitude with any accuracy, the transponder also transmits back the aircraft's altitude measured by its [[altimeter]], and an ID number identifying the aircraft, which is displayed on the radar screen.\n*[[Electronic countermeasures]] (ECM) \u2013 Military defensive electronic systems designed to degrade enemy radar effectiveness, or deceive it with false information, to prevent enemies from locating local forces.   It often consists of powerful microwave transmitters that can mimic enemy radar signals to create false target indications on the enemy radar screens.  \n*[[Radar altimeter]] \u2013 a specialized radar on an aircraft that measures the altitude of the aircraft above terrain by bouncing a radio beam off the ground surface and measuring the time for the echo to return.\n\n[[File:Rotating marine radar - rotating waveguide antenna.gif|thumb|upright=0.7|Rotating marine radar antenna on ship.]]\n\n*[[Marine radar]] \u2013 an [[X band]] radar on ships used to detect nearby ships and obstructions like bridges.  A rotating antenna sweeps a vertical fan-shaped beam of microwaves around the water surface surrounding the craft out to the horizon.  \n*[[Weather radar]] \u2013 A [[Doppler radar]] which maps weather systems and measures wind speeds by reflection of microwaves from raindrops. \n*[[Phased-array radar]] \u2013 a radar set that uses a [[phased array]], a computer-controlled antenna that can steer the radar beam quickly to point in different directions without moving the antenna.  Phased-array radars were developed by the military to track fast-moving missiles and aircraft.  They are widely used in military equipment and are now spreading to civilian applications.\n*[[Synthetic aperture radar]](SAR) \u2013 a specialized airborne radar set that produces a high-resolution map of ground terrain.  The radar is mounted on an aircraft or spacecraft and the radar antenna radiates a beam of radio waves sideways at right angles to the direction of motion, toward the ground.  In processing the return radar signal, the motion of the vehicle is used to simulate a large antenna, giving the radar a higher resolution.\n*[[Ground-penetrating radar]] \u2013 a specialized radar instrument which is rolled along the ground surface in a cart and transmits a beam of radio waves into the ground, producing an image of subsurface objects.  Frequencies from 100&nbsp;MHz to a few GHz are used.  Since radio waves cannot penetrate very far into earth, the depth of GPR is limited to about 50 feet.\n*[[Collision avoidance system]] \u2013 a short range radar or [[LIDAR]] system on an automobile or vehicle that detects if the vehicle is about to collide with an object and applies the brakes to prevent the collision.\n*[[Fuze#Proximity fuze|Radar fuze]] \u2013 a [[detonator]] for an [[aerial bomb]] which uses a radar altimeter to measure the height of the bomb above the ground as it falls and detonates it at a certain altitude.  \n*[[Radar speed gun]] \u2013 A handheld [[Doppler radar]] used by traffic police to measure the speed of vehicles to determine if they are obeying the local [[speed limit]].  When the officer points the gun at a vehicle and presses a trigger, its speed appears on a numeric display.  Speed guns use the [[X band]] or [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub> band]].\n\n===Radiolocation===\n{{main|Radiolocation}}\nRadiolocation is a generic term covering a variety of techniques which use radio waves to find the location of objects, or for navigation\n[[Image:Paris-PorteMolitor-GPS.jpg|thumb|A [[personal navigation assistant]] [[GPS receiver]] in a car, which can give driving directions to a destination.]]\n\n*[[GNSS|Global Navigation Satellite System]] (GNSS) or ''satnav system'' \u2013 A system of satellites which allows geographical location on Earth ([[latitude]], [[longitude]], and altitude/elevation) to be determined to high precision (within a few metres) by small portable navigation instruments, by timing the arrival of radio signals from the satellites.  These are the most widely used navigation systems today.  The main satellite navigation systems are the US [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS), [[Russia]]'s [[GLONASS]], [[China]]'s [[BeiDou Navigation Satellite System]] (BDS) and the [[European Union]]'s [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]].\n**[[Global Positioning System]](GPS) \u2013 The most widely used satellite navigation system, maintained by the US Air Force, which uses a constellation of 31 satellites in [[low Earth orbit]].  The orbits of the satellites are distributed so at any time at least four satellites are above the horizon over each point on Earth.   Each satellite has an onboard [[atomic clock]] and transmits a continuous radio signal containing a precise time signal as well as its current position. Two frequencies are used, 1.2276 and 1.57542&nbsp;GHz. Since the velocity of radio waves is virtually constant, the delay of the radio signal from a satellite is proportional to the distance of the receiver from the satellite.  By receiving the signals from at least four satellites a [[GPS receiver]] can calculate its position on Earth by comparing the arrival time of the radio signals.     Since each satellite's position is known precisely at any given time, from the delay the position of the receiver can be calculated by a microprocessor in the receiver. The position can be displayed as latitude and longitude, or as a marker on an electronic map.   GPS receivers are incorporated in almost all cellphones and in vehicles such as automobiles, aircraft, and ships, and are used to guide [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drones]], [[missile]]s, [[cruise missile]]s, and even [[artillery shell]]s to their target, and handheld GPS receivers are produced for hikers and the military.\n*[[Radio beacon]] \u2013 a fixed location terrestrial radio transmitter which transmits a continuous radio signal used by aircraft and ships for [[navigation]].  The locations of beacons are plotted on navigational maps used by aircraft and ships.[[Image:D-VOR PEK.JPG|thumb|VOR/DME aircraft radio navigation beacon]]\n**[[VHF Omnidirectional Range|Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range]] (VOR) \u2013 a worldwide aircraft [[radio navigation]] system consisting of fixed ground [[radio beacon]]s transmitting between 108.00 and 117.95&nbsp;MHz in the [[very high frequency|VHF]] band.  An automated navigational instrument on the aircraft displays a [[bearing (navigation)|bearing]] to a nearby VOR transmitter. A VOR beacon transmits two signals simultaneously on different frequencies.  A [[directional antenna]] transmits a beam of radio waves that rotates like a lighthouse at a fixed rate, 30 times per second. When the directional beam is facing north, an [[omnidirectional antenna]] transmits a pulse. By measuring the difference in [[phase (waves)|phase]] of these two signals, an aircraft can determine its [[bearing (navigation)|bearing]] (or \"radial\") from the station accurately.   By taking a bearing on two VOR beacons an aircraft can determine its position (called a \"fix\") to an accuracy of about {{convert|90|m|ft|sigfig=2}}.  Most VOR beacons also have a distance measuring capability, called [[distance measuring equipment]] (DME); these are called VOR/DME's.  The aircraft transmits a radio signal to the VOR/DME beacon and a [[transponder]] transmits a return signal.  From the [[propagation delay]] between the transmitted and received signal the aircraft can calculate its distance from the beacon.  This allows an aircraft to determine its location \"fix\" from only one VOR beacon.  Since line-of-sight VHF frequencies are used VOR beacons have a range of about 200 miles for aircraft at cruising altitude.  [[TACAN]] is a similar military radio beacon system which transmits in 962\u20131213&nbsp;MHz, and a combined VOR and TACAN beacon is called a [[VORTAC]].    In 2000 there were about 3000 VOR beacons worldwide, but this number is declining as aviation switches to the [[RNAV]] system that relies on [[Global Positioning System]] satellite navigation.\n**[[Non-directional beacon]] (NDB) \u2013 Legacy fixed radio beacons used before the VOR system that transmit a simple signal in all directions for aircraft or ships to use for [[radio direction finding]].   Aircraft use [[automatic direction finder]] (ADF) receivers which use a [[directional antenna]] to determine the [[bearing (navigation)|bearing]] to the beacon.  By taking bearings on two beacons they can determine their position.  NDBs use frequencies between 190 and 1750&nbsp;kHz in the [[Low frequency|LF]] and [[Medium frequency|MF]] bands which propagate beyond the horizon as [[ground wave]]s or [[skywave]]s much farther than VOR beacons.  They transmit a [[callsign]] consisting of one to 3 [[Morse code]] letters as an identifier.  [[Image:EPIRB (1).jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|EPIRB emergency locator beacon on a ship]]\n*[[Emergency locator beacon]] \u2013 a portable battery powered [[radio transmitter]] used in emergencies to locate airplanes, vessels, and persons in distress and in need of immediate rescue.  Various types of emergency locator beacons are carried by aircraft, ships, vehicles, hikers and cross-country skiers.  In the event of an emergency, such as the aircraft crashing, the ship sinking, or a hiker becoming lost, the transmitter is deployed and begins to transmit a continuous radio signal, which is used by [[search and rescue]] teams to quickly find the emergency and render aid.  The latest generation [[Emergency Position Indicating Rescue Beacon]]s (EPIRBs) contain a [[GPS receiver]], and broadcast to rescue teams their exact location within 20 meters. \n**[[International Cospas-Sarsat Programme|Cospas-Sarsat]] \u2013 an international humanitarian consortium of governmental and private agencies which acts as a dispatcher for [[search and rescue]] operations.  It operates a network of about 47 [[satellite]]s carrying radio receivers, which detect distress signals from [[emergency locator beacon]]s anywhere on Earth transmitting on the international Cospas distress frequency of 406&nbsp;MHz.  The satellites calculate the geographic location of the beacon within 2&nbsp;km by measuring the [[Doppler shift|Doppler frequency shift]] of the radio waves due to the relative motion of the transmitter and the satellite, and quickly transmit the information to the appropriate local [[first responder]] organizations, which perform the [[search and rescue]].   \n[[File:Tracking Mountain Lions.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Wildlife officer tracking radio tagged mountain lion]]    \n*[[Radio direction finding]] (RDF) \u2013 this is a general technique, used since the early 1900s, of using specialized radio receivers with [[directional antenna]]s (RDF receivers) to determine the exact [[bearing (navigation)|bearing]] of a radio signal, to determine the location of the transmitter.  The location of a terrestrial transmitter can be determined by simple [[triangulation]] from bearings taken by two RDF stations separated geographically, as the point where the two bearing lines cross, this is called a \"fix\".  Military forces use RDF to locate enemy forces by their tactical radio transmissions, [[counterintelligence]] services use it to locate clandestine transmitters used by [[espionage|espionage agent]]s, and governments use it to locate unlicensed transmitters or interference sources.  Older RDF receivers used rotatable [[loop antenna]]s, the antenna is rotated until the radio signal strength is weakest, indicating the transmitter is in one of the antenna's two [[null (radio)|null]]s.  The nulls are used since they are sharper than the antenna's [[main lobe|lobes]] (maxima).   More modern receivers use [[phased array]] antennas which have much greater angular resolution.\n**[[Animal migration tracking]] \u2013 a widely used technique in [[wildlife biology]], [[conservation biology]], and [[wildlife management]] in which small battery-powered radio transmitters are attached to [[wild animal]]s so their movements can be tracked with a directional [[radio direction finding|RDF]] receiver. Sometimes the transmitter is implanted in the animal.  The VHF band is typically used since antennas in this band are fairly compact.  The receiver has a [[directional antenna]] (typically a small [[Yagi antenna|Yagi]]) which is rotated until the received signal is strongest; at this point the antenna is pointing in the direction of the animal.  Sophisticated systems used in recent years use satellites to track the animal, or [[geolocation]] tags with [[global positioning system|GPS]] receivers which record and transmit a log of the animal's location.\n\n===Remote control===\n{{main|Radio control}}\n\n[[Image:MQ-1 Predator unmanned aircraft.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|US Air Force [[MQ-1 Predator]] drone flown remotely by a pilot on the ground]]\nRadio remote control is the use of electronic [[control signal]]s sent by radio waves from a transmitter to control the actions of a device at a remote location.  Remote control systems may also include [[telemetry]] channels in the other direction, used to transmit real-time information of the state of the device back to the control station.  Unmanned [[spacecraft]] are an example of remote controlled machines, controlled by commands transmitted by [[satellite ground station]]s.  Most handheld [[remote control]]s used to control [[consumer electronics]] products like televisions or DVD players actually operate by [[infrared light]] rather than radio waves, so are not examples of radio remote control.  A security concern with remote control systems is [[spoofing attack|spoofing]], in which an unauthorized person transmits an imitation of the control signal to take control of the device.  Examples of radio remote control:\n*[[Unmanned aerial vehicle]] (UAV, drone) \u2013 A drone is an aircraft without an onboard pilot, flown by remote control by a pilot in another location, usually in a piloting station on the ground.  They are used by the military for reconnaissance and ground attack, and more recently by the civilian world for news reporting and [[aerial photography]].   The pilot uses aircraft controls like a joystick or steering wheel, which create control signals which are transmitted to the drone by radio to control the flight surfaces and engine.  A [[telemetry]] system transmits back a video image from a camera in the drone to allow the pilot to see where he is going, and data from a [[GPS receiver]] giving the real-time position of the aircraft.  UAVs have sophisticated onboard [[automatic pilot]] systems that maintain stable flight and only require manual control to change directions.\n\n[[Image:Automobile remote keyless entry transmitter.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Remote keyless entry fob for a car]] \n*[[Keyless entry system]]  \u2013 a short-range handheld battery powered [[key fob]] transmitter, included with most modern cars, which can lock and unlock the doors of a vehicle from outside, eliminating the need to use a key.  When a button is pressed, the transmitter sends a coded radio signal to a receiver in the vehicle, operating the locks.  The fob must be close to the vehicle, typically within 5 to 20 meters.  North America and Japan use a frequency of 315&nbsp;MHz, while Europe uses 433.92 and 868&nbsp;MHz.  Some models can also remotely start the engine, to warm up the car.  A security concern with all keyless entry systems is a [[replay attack]], in which a thief uses a special receiver (\"code grabber\") to record the radio signal during opening, which can later be replayed to open the door.  To prevent this, keyless systems use a [[rolling code]] system in which a [[pseudorandom number generator]] in the remote control generates a different random key each time it is used.  To prevent thieves from simulating the pseudorandom generator to calculate the next key, the radio signal is also [[encryption|encrypted]].\n**[[Garage door opener]] \u2013 a short-range handheld transmitter which can open or close a building's electrically operated [[garage door]] from outside, so the owner can open the door when he drives up in his car, and close it after he leaves.  When a button is pressed the control transmits a coded [[Frequency-shift keying|FSK]] radio signal to a receiver in the opener, raising or lowering the door.  Modern openers use 310, 315 or 390&nbsp;MHz.  To prevent a thief using a [[replay attack]], modern openers use a [[rolling code]] system.\n\n[[Image:Md4-200.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Quadcopter]], a popular remote-controlled toy]]\n*[[Radio-controlled model]]s \u2013 a popular hobby is playing with radio-controlled model boats, cars, airplanes, and helicopters ([[quadcopter]]s) which are controlled by radio signals from a handheld console with a [[joystick]].

It consists of a doorbell button beside the door containing a small battery powered transmitter.  When the doorbell is pressed it sends a signal to a receiver inside the house with a speaker that sounds chimes to indicate someone is at the door.  They usually use the 2.4&nbsp;GHz [[ISM band]].  The frequency channel used can usually be changed by the owner in case another nearby doorbell is using the same channel.\n{{breakafterimages}}\n\n===Jamming===\n[[Radio jamming]] is the deliberate radiation of radio signals designed to interfere with the reception of other radio signals.

Radio astronomers use [[radio telescope]]s, large radio antennas and receivers, to receive and study the radio waves from [[astronomical radio source]]s.  Since astronomical radio sources are so far away, the radio waves from them are extremely weak, requiring extremely sensitive receivers, and radio telescopes are the most sensitive radio receivers in existence.  They use large [[parabolic antenna|parabolic (dish) antennas]] up to {{convert|500|meters|feet|sigfig=1}} in diameter to collect enough radio wave energy to study.  The [[RF front end]] electronics of the receiver is often cooled by [[liquid nitrogen]] to reduce [[thermal noise]].   Multiple antennas are often linked together in arrays which function as a single antenna, to increase collecting power.  In [[VLBI|Very Long Baseline Interferometry]] (VLBI) radio telescopes on different continents are linked, which can achieve the resolution of an antenna thousands of miles in diameter.  \n*[[Remote sensing]] \u2013 in radio, remote sensing is the reception of electromagnetic waves radiated by natural objects or the atmosphere for scientific research.  All warm objects emit [[microwave]]s and the spectrum emitted can be used to determine temperature.  [[Microwave radiometer]]s are used in [[meteorology]] and [[earth science]]s to determine temperature of the atmosphere and earth surface, as well as chemical reactions in the atmosphere.\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Primary sources|section|date=December 2019}}\nThe word \"radio\" is derived from the Latin word \"radius\", meaning \"spoke of a wheel, beam of light, ray\". It was first applied to communications in 1881 when, at the suggestion of French scientist [[:fr:Ernest Mercadier|Ernest Mercadier]], [[Alexander Graham Bell]] adopted \"radiophone\" (meaning \"radiated sound\") as an alternate name for his [[photophone]] optical transmission system.<ref>\"Production of Sound by Radiant Energy\" by Alexander Graham Bell, ''Popular Science Monthly'', July, 1881, pages 329\u2013330: \"[W]e have named the apparatus for the production and reproduction of sound in this way the \"photophone\", ''because an ordinary beam of light contains the rays which are operative.'' To avoid in future any misunderstandings upon this point, we have decided to adopt the term \"''radiophone''\", proposed by M. Mercadier, as a general term signifying the production of sound by any form of radiant energy...\"</ref> However, this invention would not be widely adopted.\n\nFollowing [[Heinrich Hertz]]'s discovery of the existence of [[radio waves]] in 1886, a variety of terms were initially used for this radiation, including \"Hertzian waves\", \"electric waves\", and \"ether waves\".  The first practical radio communications systems, developed by [[Guglielmo Marconi]] in 1894\u20135, transmitted [[telegraph]] signals by radio waves, so radio communication was first called \"[[wireless telegraphy]]\".  Up until about 1910 the term \"wireless telegraphy\" also included a variety of other experimental systems for transmitting telegraph signals without wires, including [[electrostatic induction]], [[electromagnetic induction]] and [[Electrical conductor|aquatic and earth conduction]], so there was a need for a more precise term referring exclusively to electromagnetic radiation.\n\nThe first use of ''radio-'' in conjunction with electromagnetic radiation appears to have been by French physicist [[\u00c9douard Branly]], who in 1890 developed the [[coherer]] detector, which he called in French a ''[[:fr:radioconducteur|radio-conducteur]]''.<ref>\"The Genesis of Wireless Telegraphy\" by [[Archie Frederick Collins|A. Frederick Collins]], ''Electrical World and Engineer'', May 10, 1902, page 811.</ref> The radio- prefix was later used to form additional descriptive compound and hyphenated words, especially in Europe. For example, in early 1898 the British publication ''The Practical Engineer'' included a reference to \"the radiotelegraph\" and \"radiotelegraphy\",<ref>\"Wireless Telegraphy\", ''The Practical Engineer'', February 25, 1898, page 174. \"Dr. O. J. Lodge, who preceded Marconi in making experiments in what may be called \"ray\" telegraphy or radiotelegraphy by a year or two, has devised a new method of sending and receiving the messages. The reader will understand that in the radiotelegraph electric waves forming the signals of the message start from the sending instrument and travel in all directions like rays of light from a lamp, only they are invisible.\"</ref> The French text of both the 1903 and 1906 Berlin Radiotelegraphic Conventions includes the phrases \"radiot\u00e9l\u00e9graphique\" and \"radiot\u00e9l\u00e9grammes\".\n\nThe use of \"radio\" as a standalone word dates back to at least December 30, 1904, when instructions issued by the British Post Office for transmitting telegrams specified that \"The word 'Radio'... is sent in the Service Instructions\".<ref>\"Wireless Telegraphy\", ''The Electrical Review'' (London), January 20, 1905, page 108, quoting from the British Post Office's December 30, 1904 ''Post Office Circular''.</ref> This practice was universally adopted, and the word \"radio\" introduced internationally, by the 1906 Berlin Radiotelegraphic Convention, which included a Service Regulation specifying that \"Radiotelegrams shall show in the preamble that the service is 'Radio'\".\n\nThe switch to \"radio\" in place of \"wireless\" took place slowly and unevenly in the English-speaking world. [[Lee de Forest]] helped popularize the new word in the United States\u2014in early 1907 he founded the DeForest Radio Telephone Company, and his letter in the June 22, 1907 ''Electrical World'' about the need for legal restrictions warned that \"Radio chaos will certainly be the result until such stringent regulation is enforced\".<ref>\"Interference with Wireless Messages\", ''Electrical World'', June 22, 1907, page 1270.</ref> The United States Navy would also play a role. Although its translation of the 1906 Berlin Convention used the terms \"wireless telegraph\" and \"wireless telegram\", by 1912 it began to promote the use of \"radio\" instead. The term started to become preferred by the general public in the 1920s with the introduction of broadcasting. (the word ''broadcasting'' originated with the agricultural term meaning roughly \"scattering seeds widely\".) British Commonwealth countries continued to commonly use the term \"wireless\" until the mid-20th century, though the magazine of the [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]] in the UK has been called ''[[Radio Times]]'' since its founding in the early 1920s.\n\nIn recent years \"wireless\" has gained renewed popularity as a more general term for devices communicating using electromagnetic radiation, either radio waves or light, due to the rapid growth of short-range computer networking, e.g., [[Wireless LAN|wireless local area network]]s [[Wi-Fi]], and Bluetooth, as well as cell phones, to distinguish these uses from traditional \"radio\" communication, such as broadcasting.\n\n==History==\n:''See'' [[History of radio]], [[Invention of radio]], [[Timeline of radio]], [[History of broadcasting]]\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Radio}}\n* [[Outline of radio]]\n* [[Electromagnetic radiation and health]]\n* [[Radio quiet zone]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons+cat|Radio|Radio}}\n{{Wikiquote}}\n\n{{Morse code}}\n{{Telecommunications}}\n{{Audio broadcasting}}\n{{Radio spectrum}}\n{{Media culture}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Advertising by medium]]\n[[Category:Radio| ]]\n[[Category:British inventions]]\n[[Category:Italian inventions]]\n[[Category:Media formats]]\n[[Category:Promotion and marketing communications]]\n", "name_user": "105.225.106.165", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio"}

New York City, for instance, took preparatory steps more than a decade ago, but then discontinued them in favor of other priorities.<ref>[https://nypost.com/2020/04/07/nycs-pandemic-preparations-that-started-and-stopped/ \"NYC's pandemic preparations that started\u2014and stopped\"], ''New York Post'', April 7, 2020</ref>\n\nWith the current pandemic, once cases began spreading throughout the nation, federal and state agencies began taking urgent steps to prepare for a surge of hospital patients. Among the actions was establishing additional places for patients in case hospitals became overwhelmed. That included transforming buildings normally used for sports and entertainment events by turning them into field hospitals. The [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]], for instance, was cancelled and the fairgrounds where it is normally held was turned into a medical center.<ref>[https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2020-03-30/coronavirus-event-companies-coachella-pivot-covid-19-testing \"They were supposed to build stages for Coachella.

The models can incorporate mitigation measures, seasonality, randomness, and other factors that can vary during a real epidemic.

The design, intended to solve the problem of stockpile waste and decay, was completed in 2018. Halyard requested funding to build a prototype, but this was not granted.\n\nA second BARDA contract was signed with Applied Research Associates of Albuquerque, to design an N95-rated mask that could be reused in emergencies without reduced effectiveness.

A contract was awarded Newport Medical Instruments, a small ventilator manufacturer, with a target price of $3,000, much lower than more complicated machines costing over $10,000, and it produced prototypes with target FDA approval in 2013. [[Covidien]] purchased NMI and after for more money to complete the project (bringing the total cost to around $8 million) asked the government to cancel the contract, saying it wasn't profitable. The government awarded a new $13.8 million contract to [[Philips]], in 2014. The design for the Trilogy Evo Universal gained FDA approval in July 2019. The government ordered 10,000 ventilators in September 2019, with a mid-2020 deadline for the first deliveries and a deadline of 2022 to complete all 10,000.

Retrieved March 23, 2020</ref>\n\n===Containment and mitigation===\n\n{{See also|Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19}}\n\nThe early phases of public health efforts for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations such as the CDC focus on both containment, to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic attempts to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''The Plain Dealer'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19, at the other extreme, is a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |publisher=NPR |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, 2020, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.

plots above are charts showing the exponential growth of COVID-19 tests in the U.S. since February 26, 2020. The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.

Among those is the [[Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations]], co-founded by the [[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation]], [[Wellcome Trust]], the [[European Commission]]. Since 2017 it has tried to produce a platform approach for dealing with emerging epidemic disease such as Covid-19, which would enable rapid vaccine development and immunity research in reponse to outbreaks.<ref name=wsj-prep>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/preparing-for-the-next-pandemic-11585936915 \"Preparing for the Next Pandemic\"], ''Wall Street Journal'', April 3, 2020</ref><ref>Gates, Bill.

The Editorial Board of the ''Wall Street Journal'', is among those who feel the world would have been \"better prepared\" had the WHO declared a \"Public Health Emergency\" weeks before it did, since the virus had by then spread to other countries and had already taken on the attributes of a pandemic.<ref name=wsj-info/> Brazil's Health Minister likewise felt that the WHO was too slow in declaring the global coronavirus outbreak a pandemic, which it did six weeks later, thereby complicating Brazil's ability to fully prepare for and curb the spread of the virus after it arrived.<ref>[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-11/who-s-pandemic-declaration-came-too-late-brazil-says \"WHO's Pandemic Declaration Came Too Late, Brazil Says\"], 'Bloomberg'', March 11, 2020</ref> By the time it was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020, the virus had already spread across all continents except Antarctica, to 110 countries, leaving less time for some countries to fully prepare their emergency health organizations.<ref>[https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/3/9/21163412/who-coronavirus-covid19-pandemic-world-health-organization \"Why the WHO waited to call the coronavirus a pandemic\"], ''Vox'', March 11, 2020</ref><ref>[https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/02/how-coronavirus-could-become-pandemic-and-why-it-matters/#close \"Coronavirus is officially a pandemic.

New York City, for instance, took preparatory steps more than a decade ago, but then discontinued them in favor of other priorities.<ref>[https://nypost.com/2020/04/07/nycs-pandemic-preparations-that-started-and-stopped/ \"NYC's pandemic preparations that started\u2014and stopped\"], ''New York Post'', April 7, 2020</ref>\n\nWith the current pandemic, once cases began spreading throughout the nation, federal and state agencies began taking urgent steps to prepare for a surge of hospital patients. Among the actions was establishing additional places for patients in case hospitals became overwhelmed. That included transforming buildings normally used for sports and entertainment events by turning them into field hospitals. The [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]], for instance, was cancelled and the fairgrounds where it is normally held was turned into a medical center.<ref>[https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2020-03-30/coronavirus-event-companies-coachella-pivot-covid-19-testing \"They were supposed to build stages for Coachella.

The models can incorporate mitigation measures, seasonality, randomness, and other factors that can vary during a real epidemic. Similar tests are used by the insurance industry to understand risks posed by infrequent natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes.<ref name=NCBI/> \n\nThe Trump administration simulated a series of pandemic outbreaks from China in 2019 and found that the U.S. government response was \"underfunded, underprepared, and uncoordinated\". Among the conclusions of the test was the lack of certain medical supplies to meet demand due to their needing to be imported. It led President Trump to issue an executive order to make flu vaccines more readily available and of higher quality, and he provided additional funds for the pandemic threats program in the HHS.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Sanger|first=David E.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-outbreak.html|title=Before Virus Outbreak, a Cascade of Warnings Went Unheeded|date=March 19, 2020|work=The New York Times|access-date=March 20, 2020|last2=Lipton|first2=Eric|issn=0362-4331|last3=Sullivan|first3=Eileen|last4=Crowley|first4=Michael}}</ref> White House economists published a study in September 2019 that warned a pandemic could kill half a million Americans and devastate the economy.<ref> ''[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/business/coronavirus-economy-trump.html White House Economists Warned in 2019 a Pandemic Could Devastate America]'' March 31, 2020 New York Times</ref>\n\nIn 2018, the WHO also ran a simulation exercise of a global pandemic response involving more than 40 countries, although the results appear to be unavailable.<ref>[https://www.who.int/ihr/eoc-exercise/en/ \"Simulation exercise puts global pandemic readiness to the test\"], World Health Organization, Dec. 3, 2018</ref>\n\n===Centralized biodefense strategy===\n\nCiting lessons learned from the swine flu pandemic, Ebola outbreak, and the [[2001 anthrax attacks]], President Trump released a [[National Biodefense Strategy]] on September 18, 2018 in response to a Congressional directive.<ref name=\"statement\">{{cite web |last1=Trump |first1=Donald |title=Statement from the President on the National Biodefense Strategy and National Security Presidential Memorandum |url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-president-national-biodefense-strategy-national-security-presidential-memorandum/ |publisher=The White House |accessdate=March 22, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"UPI\">{{cite news |last1=Brokaw |first1=Sommer |title=Trump signs presidential memo on national biodefense |url=https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2018/09/18/Trump-signs-presidential-memo-on-national-biodefense/2071537290820/ |accessdate=March 22, 2020 |agency=United Press International |date=September 18, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite news|url=https://apnews.com/4c21af485a7d4ccebb22f7316b55d014/White-House-sets-'new-direction'-in-biodefense-strategy|title=White House Sets 'New Direction' in Biodefense Strategy|date=September 18, 2018|agency=Associated Press|access-date=September 28, 2018}}</ref><ref name=BartholomewOmberg>Rachel Bartholomew & Kristin Omberg, [https://thebulletin.org/2019/01/making-sense-of-the-2018-national-biodefense-strategy/ Making sense of the 2018 National Biodefense Strategy], ''Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists'' (January 18, 2019).</ref> According to Trump, the new strategy was designed to strengthen the nation's defenses against disease outbreaks and bioterrorism and to make responses to them more efficient and better coordinated.<ref name=\"statement\" /><ref name=\"UPI\" /> Concurrently, he released a National Security Presidential Memorandum that appointed the Secretary of HHS [[Alex Azar]] to oversee implementation of the government's new biodefense strategy and directed [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[John Bolton]] to assist in reviewing and improving the nation's biodefenses.<ref name=\"Owermohle\">{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/09/18/trump-hhs-biodefense-827973|title=Trump puts HHS in charge of defense against biological threats|last=Owermohle|first=Sarah|website=Politico|access-date=December 31, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Memo\">{{cite web |last1=Trump |first1=Donald |title=Presidential Memorandum on the Support for National Biodefense |url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/presidential-memorandum-support-national-biodefense/ |publisher=The White House |accessdate=March 22, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"statement\" /> At a time when multiple agencies and departments shared responsibility for biodefense,<ref name=BartholomewOmberg /> Bolton and Azar claimed this centralization of primary authority for biodefense in the HHS would provide greater accountability.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Watson |first1=Kathryn |title=Trump administration outlines new biodefense approach |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-administration-rolling-out-new-biodefense-strategy/ |accessdate=March 22, 2020 |publisher=CBS |date=September 18, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Reorganization and departures===\n\nIn May 2018, Bolton reorganized the executive branch's [[United States National Security Council]] (NSC), largely merging the group responsible for global [[health security]] and [[biodefense]] into a bigger group responsible for [[counter-proliferation]] and biodefense.

The design, intended to solve the problem of stockpile waste and decay, was completed in 2018. Halyard requested funding to build a prototype, but this was not granted.\n\nA second BARDA contract was signed with Applied Research Associates of Albuquerque, to design an N95-rated mask that could be reused in emergencies without reduced effectiveness. Though federal reports had called for such a project since 2006, the ARA contract wasn't signed until 2017, and missed its 15-month completion deadline, resulting in the 2020 pandemic reaching the United States before the design was ready.<ref name=\"wp-masks\" />\n\nPrevious respiratory epidemics and government planning indicated a need for a stockpile of ventilators that were easier for less-trained medical personnel to use.

A contract was awarded Newport Medical Instruments, a small ventilator manufacturer, with a target price of $3,000, much lower than more complicated machines costing over $10,000, and it produced prototypes with target FDA approval in 2013. [[Covidien]] purchased NMI and after for more money to complete the project (bringing the total cost to around $8 million) asked the government to cancel the contract, saying it wasn't profitable. The government awarded a new $13.8 million contract to [[Philips]], in 2014. The design for the Trilogy Evo Universal gained FDA approval in July 2019.

Retrieved March 23, 2020</ref>\n\n===Containment and mitigation===\n\n{{See also|Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19}}\n\nThe early phases of public health efforts for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations such as the CDC focus on both containment, to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic attempts to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''The Plain Dealer'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19, at the other extreme, is a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |publisher=NPR |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, 2020, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.

plots above are charts showing the exponential growth of COVID-19 tests in the U.S. since February 26, 2020. The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.
