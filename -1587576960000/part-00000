He was the Roman equivalent of the Greek [[divinity|divine]] [[hero]] [[Heracles]], who was the son of [[Zeus]] (Roman equivalent [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]) and the mortal [[Alcmene]]. In [[classical mythology]], Hercules is famous for his strength and for his numerous far-ranging adventures.\n\nThe Romans adapted the Greek hero's [[iconography]] and myths for their literature and art under the name ''Hercules''. In later [[Western art]] and literature and in [[popular culture]], ''Hercules'' is more commonly used than ''Heracles'' as the name of the hero. Hercules was a multifaceted figure with contradictory characteristics, which enabled later artists and writers to pick and choose how to represent him.<ref>\"Hercules,\" in ''The Classical Tradition'' (Harvard University Press, 2010), p. 426.</ref> This article provides an introduction to representations of Hercules in the [[classical tradition|later tradition]].\n\n==Mythology==\n\n===Birth and early life===\nAlthough he was seen as the champion of the weak and a great protector, Hercules' personal problems started at birth. Hera sent two witches to prevent the birth, but they were tricked by one of [[Alcmene]]'s servants and sent to another room. Hera then sent [[Snake| serpents]] to kill him in his cradle, but Hercules strangled them both. In one version of the myth, Alcmene abandoned her baby in the woods in order to protect him from Hera's wrath, but he was found by the goddess Athena who brought him to Hera, claiming he was an orphan child left in the woods who needed nourishment. Hera suckled Hercules at her own breast until the infant bit her nipple, at which point she pushed him away, spilling her milk across the night sky and so forming the [[Milky Way]]. She then gave the infant back to Athena and told her to take care of the baby herself. In feeding the child from her own breast, the goddess inadvertently imbued him with further strength and power.\n\n===The 12 Labours===\n[[File:Antonio del Pollaiolo - Ercole e l'Idra e Ercole e Anteo - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Hercules and the [[Lernaean Hydra|Hydra]]'' (c. 1475) by [[Antonio del Pollaiuolo]]; the hero wears his characteristic lionskin and wields a club]]\n[[File:Heracles and the Erymantian boar.jpg|thumb|upright|220px|Hercules capturing the [[Erymanthian Boar]], by [[:es:Jos\u00e9 Manuel F\u00e9lix Magdalena|J.M.

One cycle of these adventures became [[Western canon|canonical]] as the \"Twelve Labours\", but the list has variations. One traditional order of the labours is found in the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' as follows:<ref>Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliotheke]]'' 2.5.1\u20132.5.12.</ref>\n# Slay the [[Nemean lion|Nemean Lion]].\n# Slay the nine-headed [[Lernaean Hydra]].\n# Capture the [[Ceryneian Hind|Golden Hind of Artemis]].\n# Capture the [[Erymanthian Boar]].\n# Clean the [[Augeas|Augean]] stables in a single day.\n# Slay the [[Stymphalian birds|Stymphalian Birds]].\n# Capture the [[Cretan Bull]].\n# Steal the [[Mares of Diomedes]].\n# Obtain the girdle of [[Hippolyta]], Queen of the [[Amazons]].\n# Obtain the cattle of the monster [[Geryon]].\n# Steal the apples of the [[Hesperides]].\n# Capture and bring back [[Cerberus]].\n\n===Side adventures===\nHercules had a greater number of \"[[Heracles#Further adventures|deeds on the side]]\" ''(parerga)'' that have been popular subjects for art, including:<!--the following are organized chronologically by their creation as art works, not in any order pertaining to Hercules' deeds-->\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"4\" caption=\"Side adventures\">\nFile:Hercules killing Cacus at his Cave.jpg|Killing a fire-breathing [[Cacus]] ([[Sebald Beham]], 1545)\nFile:Taten des Herakles dt 16Jh Atlas.jpg|Holding up the sky for [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] (based on [[Heinrich Aldegrever]], 1550)\nFile:Annibale Fontana - Plaque with Hercules and Achelous - Walters 4171.jpg|Wrestling with [[Achelous]] (16th-century plaque)\nFile:Herakles Antaeus Couder decoration Louvre INV3378.jpg|Fighting the giant [[Antaeus]] ([[Auguste Couder]], 1819)\nFile:L'Enl\u00e8vement, par Paul C\u00e9zanne.jpg|Retrieving [[Alcestis]] from the underworld ([[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], 1867)\nFile:Prometheus and Hercules.jpg|Freeing [[Prometheus]] ([[Christian Griepenkerl]], 1878)\n</gallery>\n\n===Death===\n{{Main article||Heracles#Death}}\n\n==Roman era==\n{{Main article|Hercules in ancient Rome|Heracles}}\n\n[[File:Herakles snake Musei Capitolini MC247.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Baby Hercules strangling a [[snake]] sent to kill him in his [[Bassinet|cradle]] (Roman marble, 2nd century CE, in the [[Capitoline Museums]] of [[Rome]], Italy).]]\n\nThe [[Latin]] name ''Hercules'' was borrowed through [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]], where it is represented variously as [[Hercle|Heracle]], Hercle, and other forms. Hercules was a favorite subject for [[Etruscan art]], and appears often on [[bronze mirror]]s. The Etruscan form ''Herceler''<!--is this right?--> derives from the Greek ''Heracles'' via [[syncope (phonetics)|syncope]]. A mild oath invoking Hercules (''Hercule!'' or ''Mehercle!'') was a common [[interjection]] in [[Classical Latin]].<ref>W. M. Lindsay, \"Mehercle and Herc(v)lvs. [Mehercle and Herc(u)lus]\" ''The Classical Quarterly'' '''12'''.2 (April 1918:58).</ref>\n\nHercules had a number of [[Roman mythology|myths]] that were distinctly Roman. One of these is Hercules' defeat of [[Cacus]], who was terrorizing the countryside of Rome. The hero was associated with the [[Aventine Hill]] through his son [[Aventinus (mythology)|Aventinus]]. [[Mark Antony]] considered him a personal patron god, as did the emperor [[Commodus]]. Hercules received various forms of [[Religion in ancient Rome|religious veneration]], including as a [[List of Roman birth and childhood deities|deity concerned with children and childbirth]], in part because of myths about his precocious infancy, and in part because he fathered countless children. Roman brides wore a special belt tied with the \"[[Hercules knot|knot of Hercules]]\", which was supposed to be hard to untie.<ref>[[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]] 55 (edition of Lindsay); [[William Warde Fowler]], ''The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic'' (London, 1908), p. 142; Karen K.

During the [[Roman Empire|Roman Imperial era]], Hercules was worshipped locally from [[Hispania]] through [[Gaul]].\n\n===Germanic association===\n[[File:Hall of the Augustals.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A fresco from [[Herculaneum]] depicting [[Heracles]] and [[Achelous]] from [[Greek mythology|Greco]]-[[Roman mythology]], 1st century CE.]]\n\n[[Tacitus]] records a special affinity of the [[Germanic peoples]] for Hercules. In chapter 3 of his ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'', Tacitus states:\n\n{{bquote|... they say that Hercules, too, once visited them; and when going into battle, they sang of him first of all heroes.  They have also those songs of theirs, by the recital of this ''barditus''<ref>or, ''baritus'', there being scribal variants. In the 17th century, the word entered the German language as ''barditus'' and was associated with the Celtic [[bard]]s.</ref> as they call it, they rouse their courage, while from the note they augur the result of the approaching conflict. For, as their line shouts, they inspire or feel alarm.}}\n\nSome have taken this as Tacitus equating the Germanic ''[[Thor|\u00deunraz]]'' with Hercules by way of ''interpretatio romana''.<ref>Simek, Rudolf (2007:140\u2013142) translated by Angela Hall. ''Dictionary of Northern Mythology''.  D.S. Brewer. {{ISBN|0-85991-513-1}}</ref>\n\nIn the Roman era [[Hercules' Club (amulet)|Hercules' Club]] amulets appear from the 2nd to 3rd century, distributed over the empire (including [[Roman Britain]], c.f. Cool 1986), mostly made of gold, shaped like wooden clubs. A specimen found in [[K\u00f6ln-Nippes]] bears the inscription <small>\"DEO HER</small>[culi]\", confirming the association with Hercules.\n\nIn the 5th to 7th centuries, during the [[Migration Period]], the amulet is theorized to have rapidly spread from the [[Elbe Germanic]] area across Europe. These Germanic \"[[Thor|Donar's Clubs]]\" were made from deer antler, bone or wood, more rarely also from bronze or precious metals. The amulet type is replaced by the [[Viking Age]] [[Mj\u00f6lnir|Thor's hammer]] pendants in the course of the [[Christianization of Scandinavia]] from the 8th to 9th century.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Medieval mythography==\n[[File:Histoires de Troyes - Nemeian Lion.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Hercules and the [[Nemean lion]] in the 15th-century ''[[Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye|Histoires de Troyes]]'']]\n\nAfter the Roman Empire became [[Constantine the Great and Christianity|Christianized]], mythological narratives were often reinterpreted as [[allegory]], influenced by the philosophy of [[late antiquity]]. In the 4th century, [[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]] had described Hercules' return from the underworld as representing his ability to overcome earthly desires and vices, or the earth itself as a consumer of bodies.<ref>[[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]], note to ''[[Aeneid]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Serv.+A.+6.395&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0053 6.395]; Jane Chance, ''Medieval Mythography: From Roman North Africa to the School of Chartres, A.D. 433\u20131177'' (University Press of Florida, 1994), p. 91.</ref> In medieval mythography, Hercules was one of the heroes seen as a strong role model who demonstrated both valor and wisdom, while the monsters he battles were regarded as moral obstacles.<ref>Chance, ''Medieval Mythography'', pp. 168, 218, 413.</ref> One [[glossator]] noted that when [[Hercules (constellation)|Hercules became a constellation]], he showed that strength was necessary to gain entrance to Heaven.<ref>Chance, ''Medieval Mythography'', p. 219.</ref>\n\nMedieval mythography was written almost entirely in Latin, and original Greek texts were little used as sources for Hercules' myths.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Renaissance mythography==\n[[File:Henry IV en Herculeus terrassant l Hydre de Lerne cad La ligue Catholique Atelier Toussaint Dubreuil circa 1600.jpg|thumb|right|King [[Henry IV of France]] depicted as Hercules vanquishing the [[Lernaean Hydra]] (i.e. the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]]), by [[Toussaint Dubreuil]], circa 1600]]\n\nThe [[Renaissance]] and the invention of the [[printing press]] brought a renewed interest in and publication of Greek literature. Renaissance mythography drew more extensively on the Greek tradition of Heracles, typically under the Romanized name Hercules, or the alternate name [[Heracles|Alcides]]. In a chapter of his book ''Mythologiae'' (1567), the influential mythographer [[Natale Conti]] collected and summarized an extensive range of myths concerning the birth, adventures, and death of the hero under his Roman name Hercules. Conti begins his lengthy chapter on Hercules with an overview description that continues the moralizing impulse of the Middle Ages:\n<blockquote>\nHercules, who subdued and destroyed monsters, bandits, and criminals, was justly famous and renowned for his great courage. His great and glorious reputation was worldwide, and so firmly entrenched that he'll always be remembered. In fact the ancients honored him with his own temples, altars, ceremonies, and priests. But it was his wisdom and great soul that earned those honors; noble blood, physical strength, and political power just aren't good enough.<ref>[[Natale Conti]], ''Mythologiae'' Book 7, Chapter 1, as translated by John Mulryan and Steven Brown (Arizona Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, 2006), vol. 2, p. 566.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn 1600, the citizens of [[Avignon]] bestowed on [[Henry of Navarre]] (the future King [[Henry IV of France]]) the title of the ''Hercule Gaulois'' (\"Gallic Hercules\"), justifying the extravagant flattery with a genealogy that traced the origin of the House of Navarre to a nephew of Hercules' son Hispalus.<ref>The official account, ''Labyrinthe royal...'' quoted in [[Jean Seznec]], ''The Survival of the Pagan Gods'', (B.F. Sessions, tr., 1995) p. 26</ref>\n\n<br />\n\n= Worship =\n<u>Road of Hercules</u>\n\nThe Road of Hercules is a route across Southern Gaul that is associated with the path Hercules took during his 10th labor of retrieving the Cattle of Geryon from the Red Isles<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Dewitt|first=Norman|date=February 22, 2020|title=Rome and the \"Road of Hercules\"|url=|journal=Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association|volume=72|pages=59-69|via=}}</ref>'''.''' Hannibal took the same path on his march towards Italy and encouraged the belief that he was the second Hercules<ref name=\":0\" />'''.''' Primary sources often make comparisons between Hercules and Hannibal<ref name=\":0\" />. Hannibal further tried to invoke parallels between himself and Hercules by starting his march on Italy by visiting the shrine of Hercules at Gades. While crossing the alps, he performed labors in a heroic manner.  A famous example was noted by Livy, when Hannibal fractured the side of a cliff that was blocking his march. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n<u>Worship from women</u>\n\nIn ancient Roman society women were usually limited to two types of cults. Those that address feminine matters such as childbirth, and cults that required virginal chastity<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Schultz|first=Cecelia|date=February 22, 2020|title=Modern Prejudice and Ancient Praxis: Female Worship of Hercules at Rome|url=|journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Papyrologie und Epigraphik|volume=133|pages=291-297|via=}}</ref>. However, there is evidence suggesting there were female worshippers of Apollo, Mars, Jupiter, and Hercules<ref name=\":1\" />. Some scholars believe that women were completely prohibited from any of Hercules's cults. Others believe it was only the \"Ara Maxima\" that they were not allowed to worship at<ref name=\":1\" />. [[Macrobius]] in his first book of ''Saturnalia'' paraphrases from Varro's actinology: ''\"For when Hercules was bringing the cattle of Geryon through Italy, a women replied to the thirsty hero that she could not give him water because it was the day of the Goddess Women and it was unlawful for a man to taste what had been prepared for her. Hercules, therefore, when he was about to offer a sacrifice forbid the presence of women and ordered Potitius and Pinarius who where in charge of his rites, not to allow any women from taking part\"''<ref name=\":1\" />''.'' Macrobius states that women were restricted in their participation in Hercules cults, but to what extent remains ambiguous. He mentions that women were not allowed to participate in Sacrum which is general term used to describe anything that was believed to have belonged to the gods. This could include anything from a precious item to a temple. Due to the general nature of a Sacrum, we can not judge the extent of the prohibition from Macrobius alone<ref name=\":1\" />. There is also ancient writings on this topic from Aulus Gellius when speaking on how Romans swore oaths. He mentioned that Roman women do not swear on Hercules, nor to Roman men swear on Castor<ref name=\":1\" />. He went on to say that women refrain from sacrificing to Hercules<ref name=\":1\" />.  Propertius, whom in his poem 4.9 also mentions similar information as Macrobius. This is evidence that he was also using Varro as a source<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n<u>Worship in myth</u>\n\nThere is evidence of Hercules worship in myth in the Latin epic poem \"The Aeneid\". In the 8th book of the poem Aeneas finally reaches the future site of Rome, where he meets Evander and the Arcadians making sacrifices to Hercules on the banks of the Tiber river<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Loar|first=Matthew|date=February 23, 2020|title=Hercules, Mummius, and the Roman Triumph in Aeneid 8|url=|journal=Classical Philosophy|volume=112|pages=45-62|via=}}</ref>. They share a feast, and Evander tells the story of how Hercules defeated the monster Cascus, and describes him as a triumphant hero<ref name=\":2\" />. Translated from the Latin text of Vergil, Evander stated: \"Time brought to us in our time of need the aid and arrival of a god. For there came that mightiest avenger, the victor Hercules, proud with the slaughter and the spoils of threefold Geryon, and he drove the mighty bulls here, and the cattle filled both valley and riverside<ref name=\":2\" />.\n\nHercules was also mentioned in the Fables of [[Gaius Julius Hyginus]]. For example, in his fable about [[Philoctetes]] he tells the story of how Philoctetes built a funeral pyre for Hercules so his body could be consumed and raised to immortality<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusFabulae3.html|title=HYGINUS, FABULAE 100 - 149|last=Grant|first=Mary|date=|website=Theoi Texts Library|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=March 7, 2020}}</ref>. \n\n<u>Hercules and the Roman triumph</u>\n\nAccording to Livy (9.44.16) Romans were commemorating military victories by building statues to Hercules as early as 305 BCE. Also, philosopher Piny the Elder dates Hercules worship back to the time of Evander, by accrediting him with erecting a statue in the Forum Boarium of Hercules<ref name=\":22\">{{Cite journal|last=Loar|first=Matthew|date=February 23, 2020|title=Hercules, Mummius, and the Roman Triumph in Aeneid 8|url=|journal=Classical Philosophy|volume=112|pages=45-62|via=}}</ref>.  Scholars agree that there would have been 5-7 temples in Augustan Rome<ref name=\":22\" />. There are believed to be related Republican ''triumphatores,'' however, not necessarily triumphal dedications. There is two temples located in the Campus Martius. One, being the Temple of Hercules Musarum, dedicated between 187 and 179 BCE by M. Fulvius Nobilior<ref name=\":22\" />. And the other being the Temple of Hercules Custos, likely renovated by Sulla in the 80s BCE<ref name=\":22\" />\n\n==In art==\nIn Roman works of art and in Renaissance and post-Renaissance art, Hercules can be identified by his attributes, the [[Nemean Lion|lion skin]] and the gnarled [[Club (weapon)|club]] (his favorite weapon); in [[mosaic]] he is shown tanned bronze, a virile aspect.<ref>''Hercules'' almost suggests \"Hero\". The Classical and Hellenistic convention in frescoes and mosaics, adopted by the Romans, is to show women as pale-skinned and men as tanned dark from their outdoor arena of action and exercising in the [[gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]].(See also [http://academic.reed.edu/humanities/110Tech/RomanAfrica2/pompei%26herc1.jpg Reed.edu], jpg file.

He was the Roman equivalent of the Greek [[divinity|divine]] [[hero]] [[Heracles]], who was the son of [[Zeus]] (Roman equivalent [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]) and the mortal [[Alcmene]]. In [[classical mythology]], Hercules is famous for his strength and for his numerous far-ranging adventures.\n\nThe Romans adapted the Greek hero's [[iconography]] and myths for their literature and art under the name ''Hercules''. In later [[Western art]] and literature and in [[popular culture]], ''Hercules'' is more commonly used than ''Heracles'' as the name of the hero. Hercules was a multifaceted figure with contradictory characteristics, which enabled later artists and writers to pick and choose how to represent him.<ref>\"Hercules,\" in ''The Classical Tradition'' (Harvard University Press, 2010), p. 426.</ref> This article provides an introduction to representations of Hercules in the [[classical tradition|later tradition]].\n\n==Mythology==\n\n===Birth and early life===\nAlthough he was seen as the champion of the weak and a great protector, Hercules' personal problems started at birth. Hera sent two witches to prevent the birth, but they were tricked by one of [[Alcmene]]'s servants and sent to another room. Hera then sent [[Snake| serpents]] to kill him in his cradle, but Hercules strangled them both. In one version of the myth, Alcmene abandoned her baby in the woods in order to protect him from Hera's wrath, but he was found by the goddess Athena who brought him to Hera, claiming he was an orphan child left in the woods who needed nourishment. Hera suckled Hercules at her own breast until the infant bit her nipple, at which point she pushed him away, spilling her milk across the night sky and so forming the [[Milky Way]]. She then gave the infant back to Athena and told her to take care of the baby herself. In feeding the child from her own breast, the goddess inadvertently imbued him with further strength and power.\n\n===The 12 Labours===\n[[File:Antonio del Pollaiolo - Ercole e l'Idra e Ercole e Anteo - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Hercules and the [[Lernaean Hydra|Hydra]]'' (c. 1475) by [[Antonio del Pollaiuolo]]; the hero wears his characteristic lionskin and wields a club]]\n[[File:Heracles and the Erymantian boar.jpg|thumb|upright|220px|Hercules capturing the [[Erymanthian Boar]], by [[:es:Jos\u00e9 Manuel F\u00e9lix Magdalena|J.M.

One cycle of these adventures became [[Western canon|canonical]] as the \"Twelve Labours\", but the list has variations. One traditional order of the labours is found in the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' as follows:<ref>Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliotheke]]'' 2.5.1\u20132.5.12.</ref>\n# Slay the [[Nemean lion|Nemean Lion]].\n# Slay the nine-headed [[Lernaean Hydra]].\n# Capture the [[Ceryneian Hind|Golden Hind of Artemis]].\n# Capture the [[Erymanthian Boar]].\n# Clean the [[Augeas|Augean]] stables in a single day.\n# Slay the [[Stymphalian birds|Stymphalian Birds]].\n# Capture the [[Cretan Bull]].\n# Steal the [[Mares of Diomedes]].\n# Obtain the girdle of [[Hippolyta]], Queen of the [[Amazons]].\n# Obtain the cattle of the monster [[Geryon]].\n# Steal the apples of the [[Hesperides]].\n# Capture and bring back [[Cerberus]].\n\n===Side adventures===\nHercules had a greater number of \"[[Heracles#Further adventures|deeds on the side]]\" ''(parerga)'' that have been popular subjects for art, including:<!--the following are organized chronologically by their creation as art works, not in any order pertaining to Hercules' deeds-->\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"4\" caption=\"Side adventures\">\nFile:Hercules killing Cacus at his Cave.jpg|Killing a fire-breathing [[Cacus]] ([[Sebald Beham]], 1545)\nFile:Taten des Herakles dt 16Jh Atlas.jpg|Holding up the sky for [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] (based on [[Heinrich Aldegrever]], 1550)\nFile:Annibale Fontana - Plaque with Hercules and Achelous - Walters 4171.jpg|Wrestling with [[Achelous]] (16th-century plaque)\nFile:Herakles Antaeus Couder decoration Louvre INV3378.jpg|Fighting the giant [[Antaeus]] ([[Auguste Couder]], 1819)\nFile:L'Enl\u00e8vement, par Paul C\u00e9zanne.jpg|Retrieving [[Alcestis]] from the underworld ([[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], 1867)\nFile:Prometheus and Hercules.jpg|Freeing [[Prometheus]] ([[Christian Griepenkerl]], 1878)\n</gallery>\n\n===Death===\n{{Main article||Heracles#Death}}\n\n==Roman era==\n{{Main article|Hercules in ancient Rome|Heracles}}\n\n[[File:Herakles snake Musei Capitolini MC247.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Baby Hercules strangling a [[snake]] sent to kill him in his [[Bassinet|cradle]] (Roman marble, 2nd century CE, in the [[Capitoline Museums]] of [[Rome]], Italy).]]\n\nThe [[Latin]] name ''Hercules'' was borrowed through [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]], where it is represented variously as [[Hercle|Heracle]], Hercle, and other forms. Hercules was a favorite subject for [[Etruscan art]], and appears often on [[bronze mirror]]s. The Etruscan form ''Herceler''<!--is this right?--> derives from the Greek ''Heracles'' via [[syncope (phonetics)|syncope]]. A mild oath invoking Hercules (''Hercule!'' or ''Mehercle!'') was a common [[interjection]] in [[Classical Latin]].<ref>W. M. Lindsay, \"Mehercle and Herc(v)lvs. [Mehercle and Herc(u)lus]\" ''The Classical Quarterly'' '''12'''.2 (April 1918:58).</ref>\n\nHercules had a number of [[Roman mythology|myths]] that were distinctly Roman. One of these is Hercules' defeat of [[Cacus]], who was terrorizing the countryside of Rome. The hero was associated with the [[Aventine Hill]] through his son [[Aventinus (mythology)|Aventinus]]. [[Mark Antony]] considered him a personal patron god, as did the emperor [[Commodus]]. Hercules received various forms of [[Religion in ancient Rome|religious veneration]], including as a [[List of Roman birth and childhood deities|deity concerned with children and childbirth]], in part because of myths about his precocious infancy, and in part because he fathered countless children. Roman brides wore a special belt tied with the \"[[Hercules knot|knot of Hercules]]\", which was supposed to be hard to untie.<ref>[[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]] 55 (edition of Lindsay); [[William Warde Fowler]], ''The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic'' (London, 1908), p. 142; Karen K. Hersch, ''The Roman Wedding: Ritual and Meaning in Antiquity'' (Cambridge University Press, 2010), pp. 101, 110, 211.</ref> The comic playwright [[Plautus]] presents the myth of Hercules' conception as a sex comedy in his play ''[[Amphitryon (Plautus play)|Amphitryon]]''; [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] wrote the tragedy ''Hercules Furens'' about his bout with madness. During the [[Roman Empire|Roman Imperial era]], Hercules was worshipped locally from [[Hispania]] through [[Gaul]].\n\n===Germanic association===\n[[File:Hall of the Augustals.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A fresco from [[Herculaneum]] depicting [[Heracles]] and [[Achelous]] from [[Greek mythology|Greco]]-[[Roman mythology]], 1st century AD.]]\n\n[[Tacitus]] records a special affinity of the [[Germanic peoples]] for Hercules. In chapter 3 of his ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'', Tacitus states:\n\n{{bquote|... they say that Hercules, too, once visited them; and when going into battle, they sang of him first of all heroes.  They have also those songs of theirs, by the recital of this ''barditus''<ref>or, ''baritus'', there being scribal variants. In the 17th century, the word entered the German language as ''barditus'' and was associated with the Celtic [[bard]]s.</ref> as they call it, they rouse their courage, while from the note they augur the result of the approaching conflict. For, as their line shouts, they inspire or feel alarm.}}\n\nSome have taken this as Tacitus equating the Germanic ''[[Thor|\u00deunraz]]'' with Hercules by way of ''interpretatio romana''.<ref>Simek, Rudolf (2007:140\u2014142) translated by Angela Hall. ''Dictionary of Northern Mythology''.  D.S. Brewer. {{ISBN|0-85991-513-1}}</ref>\n\nIn the Roman era [[Hercules' Club (amulet)|Hercules' Club]] amulets appear from the 2nd to 3rd century, distributed over the empire (including [[Roman Britain]], c.f. Cool 1986), mostly made of gold, shaped like wooden clubs. A specimen found in [[K\u00f6ln-Nippes]] bears the inscription <small>\"DEO HER</small>[culi]\", confirming the association with Hercules.\n\nIn the 5th to 7th centuries, during the [[Migration Period]], the amulet is theorized to have rapidly spread from the [[Elbe Germanic]] area across Europe. These Germanic \"[[Thor|Donar's Clubs]]\" were made from deer antler, bone or wood, more rarely also from bronze or precious metals. The amulet type is replaced by the [[Viking Age]] [[Mj\u00f6lnir|Thor's hammer]] pendants in the course of the [[Christianization of Scandinavia]] from the 8th to 9th century.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Medieval mythography==\n[[File:Histoires de Troyes - Nemeian Lion.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Hercules and the [[Nemean lion]] in the 15th-century ''[[Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye|Histoires de Troyes]]'']]\n\nAfter the Roman Empire became [[Constantine the Great and Christianity|Christianized]], mythological narratives were often reinterpreted as [[allegory]], influenced by the philosophy of [[late antiquity]]. In the 4th century, [[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]] had described Hercules' return from the underworld as representing his ability to overcome earthly desires and vices, or the earth itself as a consumer of bodies.<ref>[[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]], note to ''[[Aeneid]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Serv.+A.+6.395&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0053 6.395]; Jane Chance, ''Medieval Mythography: From Roman North Africa to the School of Chartres, A.D. 433\u20131177'' (University Press of Florida, 1994), p. 91.</ref> In medieval mythography, Hercules was one of the heroes seen as a strong role model who demonstrated both valor and wisdom, while the monsters he battles were regarded as moral obstacles.<ref>Chance, ''Medieval Mythography'', pp. 168, 218, 413.</ref> One [[glossator]] noted that when [[Hercules (constellation)|Hercules became a constellation]], he showed that strength was necessary to gain entrance to Heaven.<ref>Chance, ''Medieval Mythography'', p. 219.</ref>\n\nMedieval mythography was written almost entirely in Latin, and original Greek texts were little used as sources for Hercules' myths.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Renaissance mythography==\n[[File:Henry IV en Herculeus terrassant l Hydre de Lerne cad La ligue Catholique Atelier Toussaint Dubreuil circa 1600.jpg|thumb|right|King [[Henry IV of France]] depicted as Hercules vanquishing the [[Lernaean Hydra]] (i.e. the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]]), by [[Toussaint Dubreuil]], circa 1600]]\n\nThe [[Renaissance]] and the invention of the [[printing press]] brought a renewed interest in and publication of Greek literature. Renaissance mythography drew more extensively on the Greek tradition of Heracles, typically under the Romanized name Hercules, or the alternate name [[Heracles|Alcides]]. In a chapter of his book ''Mythologiae'' (1567), the influential mythographer [[Natale Conti]] collected and summarized an extensive range of myths concerning the birth, adventures, and death of the hero under his Roman name Hercules. Conti begins his lengthy chapter on Hercules with an overview description that continues the moralizing impulse of the Middle Ages:\n<blockquote>\nHercules, who subdued and destroyed monsters, bandits, and criminals, was justly famous and renowned for his great courage. His great and glorious reputation was worldwide, and so firmly entrenched that he'll always be remembered. In fact the ancients honored him with his own temples, altars, ceremonies, and priests. But it was his wisdom and great soul that earned those honors; noble blood, physical strength, and political power just aren't good enough.<ref>[[Natale Conti]], ''Mythologiae'' Book 7, Chapter 1, as translated by John Mulryan and Steven Brown (Arizona Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, 2006), vol. 2, p. 566.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn 1600, the citizens of [[Avignon]] bestowed on [[Henry of Navarre]] (the future King [[Henry IV of France]]) the title of the ''Hercule Gaulois'' (\"Gallic Hercules\"), justifying the extravagant flattery with a genealogy that traced the origin of the House of Navarre to a nephew of Hercules' son Hispalus.<ref>The official account, ''Labyrinthe royal...'' quoted in [[Jean Seznec]], ''The Survival of the Pagan Gods'', (B.F. Sessions, tr., 1995) p. 26</ref>\n\n<br />\n\n= Worship =\n<u>Road of Hercules</u>\n\nThe Road of Hercules is a route across Southern Gaul that is associated with the path Hercules took during his 10th labor of retrieving the Cattle of Geryon from the Red Isles<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Dewitt|first=Norman|date=February 22, 2020|title=Rome and the \"Road of Hercules\"|url=|journal=Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association|volume=72|pages=59-69|via=}}</ref>'''.''' Hannibal took the same path on his march towards Italy and encouraged the belief that he was the second Hercules<ref name=\":0\" />'''.''' Primary sources often make comparisons between Hercules and Hannibal<ref name=\":0\" />. Hannibal further tried to invoke parallels between himself and Hercules by starting his march on Italy by visiting the shrine of Hercules at Gades. While crossing the alps, he performed labors in a heroic manner.  A famous example was noted by Livy, when Hannibal fractured the side of a cliff that was blocking his march. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n<u>Worship from women</u>\n\nIn ancient Roman society women were usually limited to two types of cults. Those that address feminine matters such as childbirth, and cults that required virginal chastity<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Schultz|first=Cecelia|date=February 22, 2020|title=Modern Prejudice and Ancient Praxis: Female Worship of Hercules at Rome|url=|journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Papyrologie und Epigraphik|volume=133|pages=291-297|via=}}</ref>. However, there is evidence suggesting there were female worshippers of Apollo, Mars, Jupiter, and Hercules<ref name=\":1\" />. Some scholars believe that women were completely prohibited from any of Hercules's cults. Others believe it was only the \"Ara Maxima\" that they were not allowed to worship at<ref name=\":1\" />. [[Macrobius]] in his first book of ''Saturnalia'' paraphrases from Varro's actinology: ''\"For when Hercules was bringing the cattle of Geryon through Italy, a women replied to the thirsty hero that she could not give him water because it was the day of the Goddess Women and it was unlawful for a man to taste what had been prepared for her. Hercules, therefore, when he was about to offer a sacrifice forbid the presence of women and ordered Potitius and Pinarius who where in charge of his rites, not to allow any women from taking part\"''<ref name=\":1\" />''.'' Macrobius states that women were restricted in their participation in Hercules cults, but to what extent remains ambiguous. He mentions that women were not allowed to participate in Sacrum which is general term used to describe anything that was believed to have belonged to the gods. This could include anything from a precious item to a temple. Due to the general nature of a Sacrum, we can not judge the extent of the prohibition from Macrobius alone<ref name=\":1\" />. There is also ancient writings on this topic from Aulus Gellius when speaking on how Romans swore oaths. He mentioned that Roman women do not swear on Hercules, nor to Roman men swear on Castor<ref name=\":1\" />. He went on to say that women refrain from sacrificing to Hercules<ref name=\":1\" />.  Propertius, whom in his poem 4.9 also mentions similar information as Macrobius. This is evidence that he was also using Varro as a source<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n<u>Worship in myth</u>\n\nThere is evidence of Hercules worship in myth in the Latin epic poem \"The Aeneid\". In the 8th book of the poem Aeneas finally reaches the future site of Rome, where he meets Evander and the Arcadians making sacrifices to Hercules on the banks of the Tiber river<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Loar|first=Matthew|date=February 23, 2020|title=Hercules, Mummius, and the Roman Triumph in Aeneid 8|url=|journal=Classical Philosophy|volume=112|pages=45-62|via=}}</ref>. They share a feast, and Evander tells the story of how Hercules defeated the monster Cascus, and describes him as a triumphant hero<ref name=\":2\" />. Translated from the Latin text of Vergil, Evander stated: \"Time brought to us in our time of need the aid and arrival of a god. For there came that mightiest avenger, the victor Hercules, proud with the slaughter and the spoils of threefold Geryon, and he drove the mighty bulls here, and the cattle filled both valley and riverside<ref name=\":2\" />.\n\nHercules was also mentioned in the Fables of [[Gaius Julius Hyginus]]. For example, in his fable about [[Philoctetes]] he tells the story of how Philoctetes built a funeral pyre for Hercules so his body could be consumed and raised to immortality<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusFabulae3.html|title=HYGINUS, FABULAE 100 - 149|last=Grant|first=Mary|date=|website=Theoi Texts Library|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=March 7, 2020}}</ref>. \n\n<u>Hercules and the Roman triumph</u>\n\nAccording to Livy (9.44.16) Romans were commemorating military victories by building statues to Hercules as early as 305 BCE. Also, philosopher Piny the Elder dates Hercules worship back to the time of Evander, by accrediting him with erecting a statue in the Forum Boarium of Hercules<ref name=\":22\">{{Cite journal|last=Loar|first=Matthew|date=February 23, 2020|title=Hercules, Mummius, and the Roman Triumph in Aeneid 8|url=|journal=Classical Philosophy|volume=112|pages=45-62|via=}}</ref>.  Scholars agree that there would have been 5-7 temples in Augustan Rome<ref name=\":22\" />. There are believed to be related Republican ''triumphatores,'' however, not necessarily triumphal dedications. There is two temples located in the Campus Martius. One, being the Temple of Hercules Musarum, dedicated between 187 and 179 BCE by M. Fulvius Nobilior<ref name=\":22\" />. And the other being the Temple of Hercules Custos, likely renovated by Sulla in the 80s BCE<ref name=\":22\" />\n\n==In art==\nIn Roman works of art and in Renaissance and post-Renaissance art, Hercules can be identified by his attributes, the [[Nemean Lion|lion skin]] and the gnarled [[Club (weapon)|club]] (his favorite weapon); in [[mosaic]] he is shown tanned bronze, a virile aspect.<ref>''Hercules'' almost suggests \"Hero\". The Classical and Hellenistic convention in frescoes and mosaics, adopted by the Romans, is to show women as pale-skinned and men as tanned dark from their outdoor arena of action and exercising in the [[gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]].(See also [http://academic.reed.edu/humanities/110Tech/RomanAfrica2/pompei%26herc1.jpg Reed.edu], jpg file.

A number of English-dubbed Italian films that featured the name of Hercules in their title were not intended to be movies about Hercules.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Hercules (comics)]]\n* [[Hercules in popular culture]] of the 20th and 21st centuries\n* [[Sword-and-sandal]]\n* [[Hercules: The Legendary Journeys]]\n* [[Strength (Tarot card)]]\n* [[Samson]]\n* [[Gilgamesh]]\n* [[Demigod]]\n* [[Persian Hercules]]\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n{{Reflist}}\n\n;Sources\n* Charlotte Coffin.

Captain Benedetti of the Operational Intelligence Service (ORS) was the correspondent. It was decided in the course of its planning in 1955 that the operation would be called \"Force K\" (K for Kabylie). It was later called \"Blue Bird\" and was continued by Governor [[Robert Lacoste|Lacoste]], who succeeded Soustelle. Captain Camous was asked to supervise the practical details of the operation. Camous, wary from his experience with special missions, allowed the police to manage the undercover agents, the backbone of the operation.\n\nThe inspector of the DST, Ousmeur, himself of Kabyle origin, came into contact with Tahar Hachiche on the order of his chain of command. Hachiche easily accepted the idea of helping to organize an anti-FLN resistance in the region where the supporters of the [[Algerian National Movement]] were numerous. He extended these proposals to Ahmed Zaidat, an innkeeper and grocer, who was well known and influential within the local population. Zaidat was careful not to reveal that he occupied functions in the FLN structure, and requested a brief period of reflection. He then reported this information to his friend, a garage mechanic named Mohamed Yazouren, friend of [[Said Mohammedi]], who encouraged [[Krim Belkacem]]. They entrusted him with the organization and responsibility of the maneuver. On the ground, especially in [[Iflissen]], Omar Toumi took charge of the recruitment, while Mehlal Said was in charge of the recruitment in [[Azazga]] region (a stela is erected in Azazga in honor of Mehlal Said and Zaidet Ahmed for their contribution to Operation Blue Bird). Toumi apparently had all the confidence of Captain Maublanc who commanded the Compagnie du 15e BCA, responsible for the sector. When they reached agreement with Za\u00efdi, Hachiche claimed the arms and the promised funds. Algiers immediately executed the plan, and the van that delivered the newspaper L'Echo d'Alger brought the first weapons ([[muskets]], [[Garand]]<nowiki/>s, [[Sten]]<nowiki/>s, [[shotguns]]), the corresponding ammunition, and 2 million francs. Thus, 200 weapons were delivered in January 1956, and 80 more  in February\u2013March.

In the films, Banner is a renowned [[physicist]] who subjected himself to a [[gamma radiation]] experiment designed to replicate a [[World War II]]-era \"super soldier\" program. The experiment failed, and now causes Banner to transform into a green, hulking and gigantic creature, with super-human strength and durability, whenever his [[heart rate]] goes above 200 bpm or if he is placed in mortal danger. The character is one of the central [[protagonist]]s of the MCU, having appeared in eight films of the series and is depicted as one of the most powerful members of the Avengers.\n\nThe Hulk is incredibly strong and throughout most of the films he acts largely on the instinct of self-preservation, attacking anything that he perceives as a threat. Over time, Banner demonstrated an increasing ability to control the transformation, calling the Hulk at will, but was generally not able to recall events during the time he was in that form. The Hulk, conversely, became increasingly aware of Banner and able to stall the transformation back \u2013 one time staying in Hulk form for two years, becoming able to speak with others and control his destructive rage. Eventually, Banner was able to merge with the Hulk, combining Banner's mind and personality with the Hulk's body and strength.\n\n== Concept, creation, and characterization ==\nThe Hulk first appeared as a comic book character in ''The Incredible Hulk'' #1 ([[cover date]]d May 1962), written by [[Stan Lee]], [[penciller|penciled]] and co-plotted by [[Jack Kirby]],<ref>{{cite book|last = DeFalco|first = Tom|authorlink = Tom DeFalco|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|date= 2008|location= London, United Kingdom|page = 85|isbn =978-0-7566-4123-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120509-radiation-rage|title=Hulk makes a monster out of gamma rays|publisher=BBC|first= Quentin|last= Cooper|date=May 11, 2012|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20161013022820/http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120509-radiation-rage|archivedate= October 13, 2016|url-status= live|accessdate=September 22, 2016}}</ref> and [[inker|inked]] by [[Paul Reinman]].

Producer [[Gale Anne Hurd]] recalled Norton's portrayals of duality in ''[[Primal Fear (film)|Primal Fear]]'' and ''[[Fight Club]]'',<ref name=\"NYCC2008Int\" /> while Norton reminded [[Kevin Feige]] of [[Bill Bixby]], who had played Banner in the 1978 TV series.<ref name=\"NortonBixby\" /> Lou Ferrigno, who played the Hulk with Bixby, remarked Norton \"has a similar physique [and a] similar personality\".<ref name=\"LouCameo\" /> Norton was a ''Hulk'' fan, citing the first comic appearances, the Bixby TV show, and Bruce Jones' run on the comic, as his favorite depictions of the character.<ref name=\"SDCC2007Panel\" /> He had expressed interest in the role for the first film.<ref name=\"PennNorton\" /> He initially turned down the part, recalling \"there [was] the wince factor or the defensive part of you that recoils at what the bad version of what that would be\", as he felt the previous film \"strayed far afield from a story that was familiar to people, [...] which is a fugitive story\". When he met Leterrier and Marvel, he liked their vision, and believed they were looking to him to guide the project.<ref name=\"NortonTotalFilm\" /> During the 2008 [[New York Comic Con]] Leterrier publicly offered [[Lou Ferrigno]] the chance to voice the Hulk for the film.<ref name=\"DarkHorizonsEditBay\" /> Originally, the Hulk's only line was \"Betty\" at the film's ending, which would have been his first word.

Do I think Hulk can carry a movie and be as entertaining as he was in ''Avengers''? I do believe that. I do believe he absolutely could. We certainly are not even going to attempt that until ''Avengers 2''. So there's a lot of time to think about it\".<ref name=\"Sep2012Sequel\" />\n\nIn June 2014, Ruffalo said he believed the studio might be considering doing a new standalone Hulk film, saying, \"I think they are, for the first time, entertaining the idea of it. When we did ''The Avengers'' it was basically 'No!', and now there is some consideration for it. But there's still nothing definitive, not even a skeletal version of what it would be\".<ref name=\"RuffaloSequelJune2014\" /> In July, Feige stated that the studio was not considering a \"Planet Hulk\" film at that time, due to wanting to feature Ruffalo's Banner in the film. However, he did not rule out a story that saw the Hulk and Banner end up in space and explained why a solo Hulk film did not occur in [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films#Phase Two|Phase Two]] of the MCU by saying, \"After the first ''Avengers'', Iron Man had his own movie, Thor had his own movie, Captain America had his own movie, and Widow and Fury were in ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier|The Winter Soldier]]''. So it was really about, frankly, ''saving'' somebody so that the only place you could get Hulk between ''Avengers'' movies is the ''next'' ''Avengers'' movie, so [director Joss Whedon] could continue to play with that in [''Avengers: Age of Ultron'']. Where we go after that, we'll see\".<ref name=\"FeigeIGNJuly2014\" />\n\nIn April 2015, Ruffalo noted that Universal holding the distribution rights to Hulk films may be an obstacle to releasing a future Hulk standalone film<ref name=\"RuffaloApril2015\" /> and reiterated this in October 2015,<ref name=\"RuffaloUSAToday\" /> and July 2017.<ref name=\"RuffaloJuly2017\" /> According to ''The Hollywood Reporter'', a potential reason why Marvel has not reacquired the film distribution rights to the Hulk as they did with [[Paramount Pictures]] for the Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America films is that Universal holds the [[Universal Parks & Resorts|theme park]] rights to several Marvel characters that Marvel's parent company, [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], wants for its own [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|theme parks]].<ref name=\"THRJulyl2015\" /> In December 2015, Ruffalo stated that the strained relationship between Marvel and Universal may be another obstacle to releasing a future standalone Hulk film.<ref name=\"RuffaloYahooDec2015\" /> The following month, he indicated that the lack of a standalone Hulk film allowed the character to play a more prominent role in ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'', ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'', and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', stating, \"We've worked a really interesting arc into ''Thor[: Ragnarok]'', ''Avengers[: Infinity War]'', and [''Avengers: Endgame''] for Banner that I think will \u2013 when it\u2019s all added up \u2013 will feel like a Hulk movie, a standalone movie\".<ref name=\"RuffaloYahooJan2016\" />\n\n=== Characterization ===\nFor ''The Incredible Hulk'', Louis Leterrier stated that Edward Norton's rewrite of the script \"has given Bruce's story real gravitas\", explaining that \"just because we're making a superhero movie it doesn't have to just appeal to 13-year-old boys. Ed and I both see superheroes as the new [[Greek pantheon|Greek gods]]\".<ref name=\"April2008Empire\" /> In taking up the character for ''The Avengers'', Mark Ruffalo said, \"He's a guy struggling with two sides of himself\u2014the dark and the light\u2014and everything he does in his life is filtered through issues of control. I grew up on the Bill Bixby TV series, which I thought was a really nuanced and real human way to look at the Hulk. I like that the part has those qualities\".<ref name=\"EW1\" /> Regarding the Hulk's place on the team, Ruffalo said, \"He's like the teammate none of them are sure they want on their team. He's a loose cannon. It's like, 'Just throw a grenade in the middle of the group and let's hope it turns out well!\"<ref name=\"Kimmel\" />\n\nBy ''Age of Ultron'', Ruffalo stated that his character had grown since the previous film and was \"a bit more complex\",<ref name=\"Ruffalo2\" /> with a confrontation brewing between Banner and the Hulk: \"There's a very cool thing happening: Hulk is as afraid of Banner as Banner is afraid of Hulk.. and they have got to come to peace somehow with each other.\"<ref name=\"Ruffalo3\" /> While filming in [[London]], Ruffalo said that Whedon still had not given him any of the Hulk's lines.<ref name=\"IGNHulkOct2014\" /> Whedon later explained that he writes the Hulk's dialogue spontaneously, saying, \"What makes the Hulk so hard to write is that you're pretending he's a werewolf when he's a superhero. You want it vice versa... So the question is, how has he progressed? How can we bring changes on what the Hulk does? And that's not just in the screenplay, that's moment to moment.\"<ref name=\"WhedonDec2014\" /> When the character next appears in ''Thor: Ragnarok'', two years have passed since ''Age of Ultron'', and Hulk has become a successful and popular gladiator on Sakaar,<ref name=\"EWMar2017Plot\" /><ref name=\"RuffaloTR\" /> having suppressed the Banner side in those years. He is forming the vocabulary \"of a toddler\",<ref name=\"EWSDCC2017\" /> with the level of Hulk's speech being \"a big conversation\" between director Taika Waititi and Marvel since it was taking into account future appearances for the character:<ref name=\"WaititiHulk\" /> ''Ragnarok'' begins an arc for the character that continues in ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018) and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019).<ref name=\"RuffaloHulkArc\" /> Ruffalo felt Hulk had \"a swagger\" in the film, and was \"much more of a character than the green rage machine\" seen in the first two ''Avengers'' films.<ref name=\"EWMar2017Plot\" />\n\nThe Hulk only appears briefly at the beginning of ''Infinity War'', with Bruce Banner spending the film trying to reintegrate with the Avengers, and to \"impress upon everybody how dangerous Thanos is\".<ref name=\"ColliderRuffaloBosemanMarch2018\" /> Joe Russo felt the Hulk refusing to appear for much of the film was only partially because he was scared, but also because he realizes that \"Banner only wants Hulk for fighting. I think he's had enough of saving Banner's ass.\" Russo added that this was \"really reflective of the journey from ''Ragnarok''... [where] these two characters are constantly in conflict with each other over control.\"<ref name=\"RussoHulkScared\" /> The difference between Hulk and Banner is intended to be shown as \"starting to blur a little bit\". Ruffalo described Hulk in ''Infinity War'' as having the mental capacity of a five-year-old.<ref name=\"ColliderRuffaloBosemanMarch2018\" /> Despite the lack of further standalone films, \"Bruce and the Hulk have managed to eke out a character arc in the six years since ''The Avengers''\", with ''Thor: Ragnarok'' and ''Infinity War'' highlighting an ongoing battle for control of which persona will manifest, expected to be resolved in ''Avengers: Endgame''.<ref name=\"ScreenRantHulkArc\" /> In ''Avengers: Endgame'', the Bruce Banner and the Hulk personalities are shown to have reconciled and merged into Professor Hulk, who has the strength of the Hulk but the intelligence of Bruce Banner.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/movies/2019/04/27/avengers-endgame-hulk/|title= Avengers: Endgame explained: The Hulk's closing scene |work=Entertainment Weekly|date=April 27, 2019|accessdate=May 1, 2019|first=Anthony|last=Breznican}}</ref><ref name=\"Gizmodo\">{{cite web|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/professor-hulk-is-avengers-endgames-gift-to-bruce-bann-1834481486|title=Professor Hulk Is Avengers: Endgame's Gift to Bruce Banner|first=Charles|last=Pulliam-Moore|website=io9|date=May 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Appearance and special effects ===\nIn filming ''The Incredible Hulk'', Leterrier cited [[Andy Serkis]]' [[motion capture]] portrayals of [[Gollum]] and [[King Kong]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'', respectively, as the standard for which he was aiming.<ref name=\"Keown\" /> Norton and Roth filmed 2500 takes of different movements the monsters would make (such as the Hulk's \"thunder claps\").<ref name=\"ProdNotes\" /> [[Phosphorescent]] [[face paint]] applied to the actors' faces and [[strobe light]]ing would help record the most subtle mannerisms into the computer.<ref name=\"LATimesShade\" /> Others including [[Cyril Raffaelli]] provided motion capture for stunts and fights,<ref name=\"IGNRoth\" /> after the main actors had done video referencing.<ref name=\"DVDBecomingHulk\" /> Leterrier hired [[Rhythm and Hues Studios|Rhythm and Hues]] to provide the CGI, rather than [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM) who created the visual effects for Ang Lee's ''Hulk''. Visual effect company, [[Image Engine]], spent over a year working on a shot where Banner's gamma-irradiated blood falls through three factory floors into a bottle.<ref name=\"VancouverSun\" /> Overall 700 effects shots were created. Motion capture aided in placing and timing of movements, but overall [[key frame]] animation by Rhythm and Hues provided the necessary \"finesse [and] superhero quality\".<ref name=\"SFXfinesse\" />\n\n[[Dale Keown]]'s comic book artwork of the Hulk was an inspiration for his design.<ref name=\"Keown\" /> Leterrier felt the first Hulk had \"too much fat [and] the proportions were a little off\". He explained, \"The Hulk is beyond perfect so there is zero grams of fat, all chiseled, and his muscle and strength defines this creature so he's like a tank.\"<ref name=\"Keown\" /> [[Visual effects supervisor]] Kurt Williams envisioned the Hulk's physique as a [[linebacker]] rather than a [[bodybuilder]]. A height of n<!-- Blonsky's estimate is a personal guess, not the actual height the filmmakers made for the digital model-->ine feet was chosen for the character as they did not want him to be too inhuman. To make him more expressive, computer programs controlling the inflation of his muscles and saturation of skin color were created. Williams cited [[flushing (physiology)|flushing]] as an example of humans' skin color being influenced by their emotions.<ref name=\"ProdNotes\" /> The animators felt green blood would make his skin become darker rather than lighter, and his skin tones, depending on lighting, either resemble an [[olive]] or even gray [[slate]].<ref name=\"LATimesShade\" /> His animation model was completed without the effects company's full knowledge of what he would be required to do: he was rigged to do whatever they imagined, in case the model was to be used for ''The Avengers'' film.<ref name=\"SFXfinesse\" /> The Hulk's medium-length hair was modeled on [[Mike Deodato]]'s art.<ref name=\"SFXfinesse\" /> He originally had a [[crew cut]], but Leterrier decided flopping hair imbued him with more character.<ref name=\"DVDBecomingHulk\" /> Leterrier cited ''[[An American Werewolf in London]]'' as the inspiration for Banner's transformation, wanting to show how painful it was for him to change.<ref name=\"AICNEditingBay\" /> As a nod to the live action TV series, Banner's eyes change color first when he transforms.<ref name=\"MTVEyes\" />\n\n''The Avengers'' was the first production in which the actor playing Banner also plays the Hulk. Ruffalo told ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine, \"I'm really excited. No one's ever played the Hulk exactly; they've always done CGI. They're going to do the ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' stop-action, stop-motion capture. So I'll actually play the Hulk. That'll be fun\".<ref name=\"NYMag\" /> The [[3D modeling|3D model]] used to create the Hulk's body was modeled after [[Long Island]] bodybuilder and male stripper Steve Romm, while the Hulk's face was modeled after Ruffalo.<ref name=\"CastRuffalo1\" /> To create the on-screen Hulk, Ruffalo performed in a motion-capture suit on set with the other actors while four motion-capture HD cameras (two full body, two focused on his face) captured his face and body movements.<ref name=\"fxguide\" /> ILM returned to create the digital Hulk. [[Jeff White (visual effects)|Jeff White]], ILM's visual effects supervisor, said, \"We really wanted to utilize everything we've developed the last 10 years and make it a pretty spectacular Hulk. One of the great design decisions was to incorporate Mark Ruffalo into the look of him. So, much of Hulk is based on Ruffalo and his performance, not only in motion capture and on set, but down to his eyes, his teeth, and his tongue.\"<ref name=\"AWN\" />\n\nFor ''Thor: Ragnarok'', ILM had to add much more detail to the character's facial features, due to the Hulk's increased dialogue. ILM visual effects supervisor Chad Wiebe explained that Ruffalo's expressions were captured fresh for the film using Medusa, a performance capture technology. With 90 different expressions captured, ILM \"built an entirely new library that would allow [Hulk] to cover a full range of normal human visual characteristics.\"<ref name=\"FXGuidePart2\" /> To help create the Hulk, a person on set was covered in green body paint, and would replicate the intended motions of the character to aid the visual effect artists.<ref name=\"ColliderSep2017Trivia\" /> Additionally, stunt actor Paul Lowe, who is under {{convert|5|ft|m}} tall, stood in for Hemsworth during some of his interactions with the Hulk so that the Hulk's stunt men would be proportionally correct. In some instances when Thor and the Hulk interacted, a digital double was used for Thor, also created by ILM, to have greater flexibility for the shots. ILM worked on all of the Hulk moments in the film outside the final fight sequence, which was completed by Framestore using ILM's assets, as Framestore was primarily responsible for [[Skeletal animation|rigging]] that sequence. Framestore completed nearly 460 shots, which featured digital doubles of Thor and Hela, Fenris, Korg, Miek, the giant Surtur at the end of the film, and over 9,000 buildings for Asgard, based on assets D Negative had from ''The Dark World'', resulting in over 263 character, vehicle, prop, and crowd rigs.<ref name=\"FXGuidePart2\" /> Taika Waititi also provided additional motion capture for the Hulk after Ruffalo had completed his scenes.<ref name=\"WaititiColliderSep2017\" />\n\nWith respect to Bruce Banner's regular appearance, his fashion sense has been critiqued with the observation that \"in just about every appearance, he's wearing a nondescript suit with a purple button down shirt\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/04/a-serious-critique-of-the-mcus-off-duty-fashion.html|title=A Serious Critique of the MCU's Street Style|publisher=[[Vulture.com]]|first=Arye|last=Dworken|date=April 23, 2018}}</ref> By contrast, Banner's \"Professor Hulk\" appearance in ''Avengers: Endgame'', including his penchant for knit sweaters, has been described as \"hot\" and \"sexy\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.popsugar.com/node/46078093|title=Uh, So, There Are a Lot of People Who Think the Hulk Is Hot Now After Seeing Avengers: Endgame|first=Quinn|last=Keaney|date=May 2, 2019|website=POPSUGAR Entertainment}}</ref>\n\n== Marvel Cinematic Universe ==\n=== Feature films ===\n{{Main|The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Avengers (2012 film)|Iron Man 3|Avengers: Age of Ultron|Thor: Ragnarok|Avengers: Infinity War|Captain Marvel (film)|Avengers: Endgame}}\n* [[Edward Norton]] portrays Bruce Banner in ''The Incredible Hulk'' (2008),<ref>{{cite news|date=August 15, 2007 |first=Jay A. |last=Fernandez |title=Signing on to a writing co-op |url=https://articles.latimes.com/2007/aug/15/entertainment/et-scriptland15/ |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=February 20, 2013 |page=[https://articles.latimes.com/2007/aug/15/entertainment/et\u2013scriptland15/2 2] |archivedate=March 13, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100313231243/http://articles.latimes.com/2007/aug/15/entertainment/et-scriptland15 |url-status=live  }}</ref> with [[Lou Ferrigno]] providing the voice of the Hulk.<ref>{{cite news |date=June 12, 2008 |first=Roger |last=Ebert |title=''The Incredible Hulk'' (PG-13) |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080612/REVIEWS/848151866 |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |accessdate=February 23, 2013 |archivedate=June 15, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615030724/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20080612%2FREVIEWS%2F848151866 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* Norton did not return to the role in ''The Avengers'' (2012),<ref>{{cite web|date=July 10, 2010 |url=http://www.hitfix.com/blogs/motion-captured/posts/exclusive-marvel-confirms-they-will-hire-new-hulk-for-avengers |title=Exclusive: Marvel confirms they will hire new Hulk for ''The Avengers'' |first=Drew |last=McWeeny |publisher=[[HitFix]] |accessdate=July 10, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100712072541/http://www.hitfix.com/blogs/2008-12-6-motion-captured/posts/exclusive-marvel-confirms-they-will-hire-new-hulk-for-avengers |archivedate=July 12, 2010 |url-status=live  }}</ref> being replaced by [[Mark Ruffalo]].<ref name=\"RuffaloAvengers\">{{cite web|date=July 23, 2010 |authorlink=Nikki Finke |last=Finke |first=Nikki |url=https://www.deadline.com/2010/07/toldja-marvel-ruffalo-reach-hulk-deal |title=Toldja!

At Culver University in Virginia, General [[Thunderbolt Ross]] meets with Dr. Bruce Banner, the colleague and boyfriend of his daughter [[Betty Ross|Betty]], regarding an experiment that Ross claims is meant to make humans immune to [[gamma radiation]]. The experiment \u2014 part of a [[World War II]] era \"super soldier\" program that Ross hopes to recreate \u2014 fails, and the exposure to gamma radiation causes Banner to transform into the Hulk for brief periods of time, whenever his heart rate rises above 200. The Hulk destroys the lab and injures or kills the people inside. Banner becomes a fugitive from the U.S. military and Ross in particular, who wants to weaponize the Hulk process.\n\nFive years later,{{efn|According to Leterrier, the film takes place about five years since Banner first transformed. The events of the film also take place simultaneously with the events of ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' (2010) and ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' (2011), set six months after the events of ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008).}} Banner works at a soda bottling factory in [[Rocinha]], [[Rio de Janeiro]] in Brazil, while searching for a cure for his condition. On the Internet, he collaborates with a colleague he knows only as \"Mr. Blue\", and to whom he is \"Mr. Green\". He also learns [[Yoga]] techniques to help keep control, and has not transformed in five months. After Banner cuts his finger, a drop of his blood falls into a bottle, and is eventually ingested by an elderly consumer in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], giving him gamma sickness. Ross tracks down Banner, sending a special forces team, led by Russian-born British [[Royal Marine]] [[Abomination (comics)|Emil Blonsky]], to capture him. Banner transforms into the Hulk and defeats Blonsky's team. Blonsky agrees to be injected with a similar serum, which gives him enhanced speed, strength, agility, and healing, but also begins to deform his skeleton and impair his judgment.\n\nBanner returns to Culver University and reunites with Betty, but is attacked a second time by Ross and Blonsky's forces, again transforming into the Hulk. The Hulk seemingly kills Blonsky and flees with Betty. After the Hulk reverts to Banner, he and Betty go on the run, and Banner contacts Mr. Blue, who urges them to meet him in New York City. Mr. Blue\u2014cellular biologist Dr. [[Leader (comics)|Samuel Sterns]]\u2014has developed a possible antidote to Banner's condition. After a successful test, he warns Banner that the antidote may only reverse each individual transformation. Sterns reveals he has [[organic synthesis|synthesized]] Banner's blood samples, which Banner sent from Brazil, into a large supply, with the intention of applying its \"limitless potential\" to medicine. Fearful of the Hulk's power falling into the military's hands, Banner wishes to destroy the blood supply. Banner is caught and Blonsky has Stern use Banner's blood to turn him into the Abomination. Blonsky then rampages through [[Harlem]]. Realizing that only the Hulk can stop Blonsky, Banner jumps from Ross' helicopter and transforms after hitting the ground. After a long and brutal battle through Harlem, the Hulk defeats Blonsky and flees. Banner soon ends his relationship with Betty, realizing it can no longer work. A month later, in [[Bella Coola, British Columbia]], Banner successfully transforms in a controlled manner. Meanwhile, [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] approaches Ross at a local bar and informs him [[The Avengers (2012 film)|a team]] is being put together.\n\n=== Joining the Avengers ===\nSeveral months later, in response to an attack by the [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]], [[Nick Fury (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nick Fury]] reactivates the \"Avengers Initiative\", and agent [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]] is sent to [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] to recruit Banner to trace the Tesseract through its [[Gamma ray|gamma radiation]] emissions. Loki is captured and placed in a cell on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s [[Helicarrier]], but agents possessed by Loki attack the Helicarrier, causing Banner to transform into the Hulk. Thor attempts to stop the Hulk's rampage, with Hulk falling to the ground after attacking a S.H.I.E.L.D. fighter jet. When the Avengers regroup in New York City, Banner arrives to join the team to battle a Chitauri invasion. Banner reveals he is \"always angry\", and transforms into the Hulk, fights the Chitauri, beats Loki into submission, and saves Stark from crashing into the ground. Banner later forms a close friendship with Stark and works with him closely, even requesting him to build an anti-Hulk armor to stop him in case he loses control and goes on a rampage.\n\nSome years later, the Avengers recover Loki's scepter, and Stark and Banner discover an [[Artificial intelligence in fiction#Sentient AI|artificial intelligence]] within the scepter's gem, and secretly decide to use it to complete Stark's \"[[Ultron]]\" global defense program. Ultron becomes sentient and recruits the Maximoffs, with [[Wanda Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wanda Maximoff]] using haunting visions to cause the Hulk to rampage until Stark stops him with his [[Iron Man's armor|anti-Hulk armor]]<!-- Please note the term \"Hulkbuster\" is not used in the film -->.{{ref|1|1}} The team then travels to a safehouse, where Romanoff and Banner plan to flee together after realizing a mutual attraction. However, Nick Fury arrives and persuades Romanoff and other team members to form a plan to stop Ultron, resulting in Romanoff being captured and taken to Sokovia. Banner finds her there, but she causes him to transform into the Hulk, in order to fight Ultron. After a final battle defeating Ultron in Sokovia, the Hulk departs in a [[Avengers Quinjet|Quinjet]] and eventually arrives at the planet Sakaar, where he is abducted by the ruler Grandmaster and eventually becomes  his champion and top-fighter in the Contest of Champions.\n\n=== Travels with Thor ===\nTwo years later, [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] crash-lands on Sakaar and is forced to fight Hulk in the Contest of Champions. Summoning lightning, Thor gets the upper hand on Hulk, but the Grandmaster sabotages the fight to ensure Hulk's victory. Still enslaved, Thor attempts to convince Hulk to help him save Asgard, and then escapes the palace and finds the Quinjet that brought Hulk to Sakaar. Hulk follows Thor to the Quinjet, where a recording of Romanoff makes him transform back into Bruce Banner for the first time since Sokovia where Banner is shocked to learn that he is on an alien planet. Banner expresses fear that if he becomes the Hulk again, he will never be able to return to his human form. Escaping Sakaar, they travel to Asgard, where Banner becomes Hulk again to save the fleeing Asgardians from the giant wolf, [[Fenris Wolf (Marvel Comics)|Fenris]], while Thor challenges his sister, Hela. As Asgard is destroyed, the Hulk, remaining in that form, accompanies Thor and the Asgardians on a ship bound for Earth.\n\n=== The Infinity War ===\n[[Thanos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)| Thanos]] and his minions intercept the ship to extract the [[Infinity Stones#Film|Space Stone]] from the [[Cosmic Cube|Tesseract]]. Hulk fights Thanos, but is easily overpowered. [[Heimdall (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Heimdall]] uses the [[Bifr\u00f6st]] to send Hulk to Earth, and Hulk crash-lands at the [[Sanctum Sanctorum]] of [[Stephen Strange (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Stephen Strange]] and his majordomo [[Wong (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wong]] in New York City, and reverts to Bruce Banner. Banner warns Strange about Thanos, and contacts the other Avengers. When minions of Thanos appear in New York to attack Doctor Strange in pursuit of the Time Stone, Banner tries to become the Hulk, but Hulk refuses to \"come out\", forcing Banner out of the action.\n\nBanner and the other Avengers travel to Wakanda, where he uses Stark's [[Hulkbuster armor|anti-Hulk]] armor to battle the invading army of Thanos, until Thanos himself arrives to retrieve the final Infinity Stone, battling the Avengers and trapping Banner, in Stark's armor, in rock. Thanos activates the Infinity Gauntlet and teleports away, as his plan comes to fruition: people begin disintegrating, while Banner and the other Avengers remain on the Wakandan battlefield.\n\nFollowing his struggles with his Hulk side in ''Thor: Ragnarok'' and ''Avengers: Infinity War'', Banner realizes that the Hulk is not a problem to solve, but the solution. During the five years following ''Avengers: Infinity War'', Banner undergoes gamma experimentation to balance his two sides. He is now permanently in the body of the Hulk but with the mind and voice of Banner.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nerdist.com/article/avengers-endgame-hulk-banner-comics/|title=What's Up with Banner and Hulk in Avengers: Endgame?|first1=Rosie|last1=Knight|work=[[Nerdist]]|date=April 25, 2019|accessdate=April 26, 2019}}</ref> When the Avengers travel through time to obtain the Infinity Stones, Banner gets the Time Stone from the [[Ancient One]] (to whom he promises to return the Stones to their respective periods in time when the Avengers are done with their mission) in 2012. He then returns to the present along with the others, and is devastated with Natasha Romanoff's death (she had sacrificed herself so that Clint Barton could earn the Soul Stone). After combining the stones with the Iron Gauntlet, Banner, because of his strength, volunteers to activate the Infinity Stones. He does so and reverses the deaths caused by Thanos at the end of ''Infinity War'', though his right arm gets permanently injured in the process.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cbr.com/joe-russo-confirms-hulk-arm-injury/ |title=Avengers Co-Director Confirms Hulk's Post-Endgame Status |date=May 6, 2019 |website=Comic Book Resources |access-date=May 14, 2019}}</ref> Banner then takes part in the climactic battle against a 2014 version of Thanos and his forces, who are eventually defeated when Tony Stark uses the Infinity Stones, at the cost of his own life. He later attends Stark's funeral along with others. After, he prepares the time machine so that [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]] can return the time-displaced Stones and Mjolnir back to the periods they were found.\n\n== Differences from the comic books ==\nCharles Pulliam-Moore , writing for ''[[Gizmodo]]'', said of the earlier MCU films that \"[w]hile there are a number of storylines from Marvel's comics that delve deeper into the duality of Banner/Hulk's identity... Marvel's movies have forgone those plot lines in favor of trotting Bruce out to babble about science and break things when necessary\".<ref name=\"Gizmodo\" /> One specific difference from the comic books is Banner's involvement in the creation of [[Ultron]] and the [[Vision (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Vision]], a character who in the comics was created solely by Ultron. The Vision, in the films, is created as a counter to Ultron, who had previously been created by Stark and Bruce Banner. In the comics, however, Ultron is created by a different member of the Avengers, Hank Pym.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://screenrant.com/iron-man-worst-changes-from-the-comic-books-to-movies/ |title=Iron Man: 15 Worst Changes From The Comic Books To The Movies |first=Ben |last=Browne |publisher=[[Screen Rant]] |date=January 18, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180114020316/https://screenrant.com/iron-man-worst-changes-from-the-comic-books-to-movies/ |archivedate=January 14, 2018 }}</ref>\n\nDue to the lack of freestanding films about the Hulk, the character has been depicted in very few of the storylines shown in the comic books. In particular, the \"[[Planet Hulk]]\" storyline from the comic books is highly condensed and worked into ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]''; the comic book storyline has the heroes of Earth intentionally sending the Hulk into space due to his excessively dangerous nature,<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #88-91 (Dec 2005-Mar 2006)</ref> while the MCU Hulk leaves Earth of his own accord. The merged Banner/Hulk storyline depicted in ''Avengers: Endgame'' also differs from the comics, where a comparable merger was accomplished by hypnosis performed by superhero psychiatrist [[Doc Samson]].<ref name=\"NewsAramaPg9\">{{cite web|title=Duo Dynamics: The Many Incarnations of HULK-BANNER Bond?

Reviewing ''The Incredible Hulk'', Mark Rahner of ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' wrote that, \"The relaunch of Marvel's green goliath is an improvement over director Ang Lee's ponderous 2003 ''Hulk'' in nearly every way \u2013 except that the actual Hulk still looks scarcely better than something from a video game, and he still barely talks\".<ref name=\"RahnerReview\" /> Conversely, [[Christy Lemire]] of the ''[[Associated Press]]'' found that \"the inevitable comparisons to ''Iron Man'', Marvel Studios' first blockbuster this summer, serve as a glaring reminder of what this Hulk lacks: wit and heart. Despite the presence of Edward Norton, an actor capable of going just as deep as Robert Downey Jr., we don't feel a strong sense of Bruce Banner's inner conflict\".<ref name=\"LemireReview\" />\n\nMark Ruffalo's portrayal of Dr. Bruce Banner/the Hulk in ''The Avengers'' was well received by commentators. Joe Neumaier opined that his performance was superior to the rest of the cast; \"Ruffalo is the revelation, turning Banner into a wry reservoir of calm ready to become a volcano.\"<ref name=\"nydaily2012\" /> Similarly, ''[[The New Yorker]]''{{'s}} [[Anthony Lane]] proclaimed Ruffalo's acting to be one of the film's highlights\u2014alongside Downey.<ref name=\"newyorker2012\" /> ''[[The Village Voice]]''{{'s}} [[Karina Longworth]] concluded: \"Ruffalo successfully refreshes the Hulk myth, playing Banner as an adorably bashful nerd-genius who, in contrast to the preening hunks on the team, knows better than to draw attention to himself.\"<ref name=\"villagevoice\" /> Travers asserted that the actor resonated a \"scruffy warmth and humor\" vibe,<ref name=\"rollz\" /> while Turan felt that he surpassed predecessors Edward Norton and [[Eric Bana]] in playing the character.<ref name=\"LATimes2\" /> Owen Gleiberman of ''Entertainment Weekly'' wrote that \"the smartest thing the filmmakers did was to get Mark Ruffalo to play Bruce Banner as a man so sensitive that he's at war, every moment, with himself. (The film finally solves the Hulk problem: He's a lot more fun in small doses)\".<ref name=\"EW-review\" />\n\n===Accolades===\n{{Anchor|Awards|Accolades}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

[[Mark Ruffalo]]\u2014based on the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Hulk|character of the same name]]\u2014known commonly by his [[alter ego]], the '''Hulk'''. In the films, Banner is a renowned [[physicist]] who subjected himself to a [[gamma radiation]] experiment designed to replicate a [[World War II]]-era \"super soldier\" program. The experiment failed, and now causes Banner to transform into a green, hulking and gigantic creature, with super-human strength and durability, whenever his [[heart rate]] goes above 200 bpm or if he is placed in mortal danger. The character is one of the central [[protagonist]]s of the MCU, having appeared in eight films of the series and is depicted as one of the most powerful members of the Avengers.\n\nThe Hulk is incredibly strong and throughout most of the films he acts largely on the instinct of self-preservation, attacking anything that he perceives as a threat. Over time, Banner demonstrated an increasing ability to control the transformation, calling the Hulk at will, but was generally not able to recall events during the time he was in that form. The Hulk, conversely, became increasingly aware of Banner and able to stall the transformation back \u2013 one time staying in Hulk form for two years, becoming able to speak with others and control his destructive rage. Eventually, Banner was able to merge with the Hulk, combining Banner's mind and personality with the Hulk's body and strength.\n\n== Concept, creation, and characterization ==\nThe Hulk first appeared as a comic book character in ''The Incredible Hulk'' #1 ([[cover date]]d May 1962), written by [[Stan Lee]], [[penciller|penciled]] and co-plotted by [[Jack Kirby]],<ref>{{cite book|last = DeFalco|first = Tom|authorlink = Tom DeFalco|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|date= 2008|location= London, United Kingdom|page = 85|isbn =978-0-7566-4123-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120509-radiation-rage|title=Hulk makes a monster out of gamma rays|publisher=BBC|first= Quentin|last= Cooper|date=May 11, 2012|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20161013022820/http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120509-radiation-rage|archivedate= October 13, 2016|url-status= live|accessdate=September 22, 2016}}</ref> and [[inker|inked]] by [[Paul Reinman]].

Producer [[Gale Anne Hurd]] recalled Norton's portrayals of duality in ''[[Primal Fear (film)|Primal Fear]]'' and ''[[Fight Club]]'',<ref name=\"NYCC2008Int\" /> while Norton reminded [[Kevin Feige]] of [[Bill Bixby]], who had played Banner in the 1978 TV series.<ref name=\"NortonBixby\" /> Lou Ferrigno, who played the Hulk with Bixby, remarked Norton \"has a similar physique [and a] similar personality\".<ref name=\"LouCameo\" /> Norton was a ''Hulk'' fan, citing the first comic appearances, the Bixby TV show, and Bruce Jones' run on the comic, as his favorite depictions of the character.<ref name=\"SDCC2007Panel\" /> He had expressed interest in the role for the first film.<ref name=\"PennNorton\" /> He initially turned down the part, recalling \"there [was] the wince factor or the defensive part of you that recoils at what the bad version of what that would be\", as he felt the previous film \"strayed far afield from a story that was familiar to people, [...] which is a fugitive story\". When he met Leterrier and Marvel, he liked their vision, and believed they were looking to him to guide the project.<ref name=\"NortonTotalFilm\" /> During the 2008 [[New York Comic Con]] Leterrier publicly offered [[Lou Ferrigno]] the chance to voice the Hulk for the film.<ref name=\"DarkHorizonsEditBay\" /> Originally, the Hulk's only line was \"Betty\" at the film's ending, which would have been his first word.

Do I think Hulk can carry a movie and be as entertaining as he was in ''Avengers''? I do believe that. I do believe he absolutely could. We certainly are not even going to attempt that until ''Avengers 2''. So there's a lot of time to think about it\".<ref name=\"Sep2012Sequel\" />\n\nIn June 2014, Ruffalo said he believed the studio might be considering doing a new standalone Hulk film, saying, \"I think they are, for the first time, entertaining the idea of it. When we did ''The Avengers'' it was basically 'No!', and now there is some consideration for it. But there's still nothing definitive, not even a skeletal version of what it would be\".<ref name=\"RuffaloSequelJune2014\" /> In July, Feige stated that the studio was not considering a \"Planet Hulk\" film at that time, due to wanting to feature Ruffalo's Banner in the film. However, he did not rule out a story that saw the Hulk and Banner end up in space and explained why a solo Hulk film did not occur in [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films#Phase Two|Phase Two]] of the MCU by saying, \"After the first ''Avengers'', Iron Man had his own movie, Thor had his own movie, Captain America had his own movie, and Widow and Fury were in ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier|The Winter Soldier]]''. So it was really about, frankly, ''saving'' somebody so that the only place you could get Hulk between ''Avengers'' movies is the ''next'' ''Avengers'' movie, so [director Joss Whedon] could continue to play with that in [''Avengers: Age of Ultron'']. Where we go after that, we'll see\".<ref name=\"FeigeIGNJuly2014\" />\n\nIn April 2015, Ruffalo noted that Universal holding the distribution rights to Hulk films may be an obstacle to releasing a future Hulk standalone film<ref name=\"RuffaloApril2015\" /> and reiterated this in October 2015,<ref name=\"RuffaloUSAToday\" /> and July 2017.<ref name=\"RuffaloJuly2017\" /> According to ''The Hollywood Reporter'', a potential reason why Marvel has not reacquired the film distribution rights to the Hulk as they did with [[Paramount Pictures]] for the Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America films is that Universal holds the [[Universal Parks & Resorts|theme park]] rights to several Marvel characters that Marvel's parent company, [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], wants for its own [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|theme parks]].<ref name=\"THRJulyl2015\" /> In December 2015, Ruffalo stated that the strained relationship between Marvel and Universal may be another obstacle to releasing a future standalone Hulk film.<ref name=\"RuffaloYahooDec2015\" /> The following month, he indicated that the lack of a standalone Hulk film allowed the character to play a more prominent role in ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'', ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'', and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', stating, \"We've worked a really interesting arc into ''Thor[: Ragnarok]'', ''Avengers[: Infinity War]'', and [''Avengers: Endgame''] for Banner that I think will \u2013 when it\u2019s all added up \u2013 will feel like a Hulk movie, a standalone movie\".<ref name=\"RuffaloYahooJan2016\" />\n\n=== Characterization ===\nFor ''The Incredible Hulk'', Louis Leterrier stated that Edward Norton's rewrite of the script \"has given Bruce's story real gravitas\", explaining that \"just because we're making a superhero movie it doesn't have to just appeal to 13-year-old boys. Ed and I both see superheroes as the new [[Greek pantheon|Greek gods]]\".<ref name=\"April2008Empire\" /> In taking up the character for ''The Avengers'', Mark Ruffalo said, \"He's a guy struggling with two sides of himself\u2014the dark and the light\u2014and everything he does in his life is filtered through issues of control. I grew up on the Bill Bixby TV series, which I thought was a really nuanced and real human way to look at the Hulk. I like that the part has those qualities\".<ref name=\"EW1\" /> Regarding the Hulk's place on the team, Ruffalo said, \"He's like the teammate none of them are sure they want on their team. He's a loose cannon. It's like, 'Just throw a grenade in the middle of the group and let's hope it turns out well!\"<ref name=\"Kimmel\" />\n\nBy ''Age of Ultron'', Ruffalo stated that his character had grown since the previous film and was \"a bit more complex\",<ref name=\"Ruffalo2\" /> with a confrontation brewing between Banner and the Hulk: \"There's a very cool thing happening: Hulk is as afraid of Banner as Banner is afraid of Hulk.. and they have got to come to peace somehow with each other.\"<ref name=\"Ruffalo3\" /> While filming in [[London]], Ruffalo said that Whedon still had not given him any of the Hulk's lines.<ref name=\"IGNHulkOct2014\" /> Whedon later explained that he writes the Hulk's dialogue spontaneously, saying, \"What makes the Hulk so hard to write is that you're pretending he's a werewolf when he's a superhero. You want it vice versa... So the question is, how has he progressed? How can we bring changes on what the Hulk does? And that's not just in the screenplay, that's moment to moment.\"<ref name=\"WhedonDec2014\" /> When the character next appears in ''Thor: Ragnarok'', two years have passed since ''Age of Ultron'', and Hulk has become a successful and popular gladiator on Sakaar,<ref name=\"EWMar2017Plot\" /><ref name=\"RuffaloTR\" /> having suppressed the Banner side in those years. He is forming the vocabulary \"of a toddler\",<ref name=\"EWSDCC2017\" /> with the level of Hulk's speech being \"a big conversation\" between director Taika Waititi and Marvel since it was taking into account future appearances for the character:<ref name=\"WaititiHulk\" /> ''Ragnarok'' begins an arc for the character that continues in ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018) and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019).<ref name=\"RuffaloHulkArc\" /> Ruffalo felt Hulk had \"a swagger\" in the film, and was \"much more of a character than the green rage machine\" seen in the first two ''Avengers'' films.<ref name=\"EWMar2017Plot\" />\n\nThe Hulk only appears briefly at the beginning of ''Infinity War'', with Bruce Banner spending the film trying to reintegrate with the Avengers, and to \"impress upon everybody how dangerous Thanos is\".<ref name=\"ColliderRuffaloBosemanMarch2018\" /> Joe Russo felt the Hulk refusing to appear for much of the film was only partially because he was scared, but also because he realizes that \"Banner only wants Hulk for fighting. I think he's had enough of saving Banner's ass.\" Russo added that this was \"really reflective of the journey from ''Ragnarok''... [where] these two characters are constantly in conflict with each other over control.\"<ref name=\"RussoHulkScared\" /> The difference between Hulk and Banner is intended to be shown as \"starting to blur a little bit\". Ruffalo described Hulk in ''Infinity War'' as having the mental capacity of a five-year-old.<ref name=\"ColliderRuffaloBosemanMarch2018\" /> Despite the lack of further standalone films, \"Bruce and the Hulk have managed to eke out a character arc in the six years since ''The Avengers''\", with ''Thor: Ragnarok'' and ''Infinity War'' highlighting an ongoing battle for control of which persona will manifest, expected to be resolved in ''Avengers: Endgame''.<ref name=\"ScreenRantHulkArc\" /> In ''Avengers: Endgame'', the Bruce Banner and the Hulk personalities are shown to have reconciled and merged into Professor Hulk, who has the strength of the Hulk but the intelligence of Bruce Banner.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/movies/2019/04/27/avengers-endgame-hulk/|title= Avengers: Endgame explained: The Hulk's closing scene |work=Entertainment Weekly|date=April 27, 2019|accessdate=May 1, 2019|first=Anthony|last=Breznican}}</ref><ref name=\"Gizmodo\">{{cite web|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/professor-hulk-is-avengers-endgames-gift-to-bruce-bann-1834481486|title=Professor Hulk Is Avengers: Endgame's Gift to Bruce Banner|first=Charles|last=Pulliam-Moore|website=io9|date=May 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Appearance and special effects ===\nIn filming ''The Incredible Hulk'', Leterrier cited [[Andy Serkis]]' [[motion capture]] portrayals of [[Gollum]] and [[King Kong]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'', respectively, as the standard for which he was aiming.<ref name=\"Keown\" /> Norton and Roth filmed 2500 takes of different movements the monsters would make (such as the Hulk's \"thunder claps\").<ref name=\"ProdNotes\" /> [[Phosphorescent]] [[face paint]] applied to the actors' faces and [[strobe light]]ing would help record the most subtle mannerisms into the computer.<ref name=\"LATimesShade\" /> Others including [[Cyril Raffaelli]] provided motion capture for stunts and fights,<ref name=\"IGNRoth\" /> after the main actors had done video referencing.<ref name=\"DVDBecomingHulk\" /> Leterrier hired [[Rhythm and Hues Studios|Rhythm and Hues]] to provide the CGI, rather than [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM) who created the visual effects for Ang Lee's ''Hulk''. Visual effect company, [[Image Engine]], spent over a year working on a shot where Banner's gamma-irradiated blood falls through three factory floors into a bottle.<ref name=\"VancouverSun\" /> Overall 700 effects shots were created. Motion capture aided in placing and timing of movements, but overall [[key frame]] animation by Rhythm and Hues provided the necessary \"finesse [and] superhero quality\".<ref name=\"SFXfinesse\" />\n\n[[Dale Keown]]'s comic book artwork of the Hulk was an inspiration for his design.<ref name=\"Keown\" /> Leterrier felt the first Hulk had \"too much fat [and] the proportions were a little off\". He explained, \"The Hulk is beyond perfect so there is zero grams of fat, all chiseled, and his muscle and strength defines this creature so he's like a tank.\"<ref name=\"Keown\" /> [[Visual effects supervisor]] Kurt Williams envisioned the Hulk's physique as a [[linebacker]] rather than a [[bodybuilder]]. A height of n<!-- Blonsky's estimate is a personal guess, not the actual height the filmmakers made for the digital model-->ine feet was chosen for the character as they did not want him to be too inhuman. To make him more expressive, computer programs controlling the inflation of his muscles and saturation of skin color were created. Williams cited [[flushing (physiology)|flushing]] as an example of humans' skin color being influenced by their emotions.<ref name=\"ProdNotes\" /> The animators felt green blood would make his skin become darker rather than lighter, and his skin tones, depending on lighting, either resemble an [[olive]] or even gray [[slate]].<ref name=\"LATimesShade\" /> His animation model was completed without the effects company's full knowledge of what he would be required to do: he was rigged to do whatever they imagined, in case the model was to be used for ''The Avengers'' film.<ref name=\"SFXfinesse\" /> The Hulk's medium-length hair was modeled on [[Mike Deodato]]'s art.<ref name=\"SFXfinesse\" /> He originally had a [[crew cut]], but Leterrier decided flopping hair imbued him with more character.<ref name=\"DVDBecomingHulk\" /> Leterrier cited ''[[An American Werewolf in London]]'' as the inspiration for Banner's transformation, wanting to show how painful it was for him to change.<ref name=\"AICNEditingBay\" /> As a nod to the live action TV series, Banner's eyes change color first when he transforms.<ref name=\"MTVEyes\" />\n\n''The Avengers'' was the first production in which the actor playing Banner also plays the Hulk. Ruffalo told ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine, \"I'm really excited. No one's ever played the Hulk exactly; they've always done CGI. They're going to do the ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' stop-action, stop-motion capture. So I'll actually play the Hulk. That'll be fun\".<ref name=\"NYMag\" /> The [[3D modeling|3D model]] used to create the Hulk's body was modeled after [[Long Island]] bodybuilder and male stripper Steve Romm, while the Hulk's face was modeled after Ruffalo.<ref name=\"CastRuffalo1\" /> To create the on-screen Hulk, Ruffalo performed in a motion-capture suit on set with the other actors while four motion-capture HD cameras (two full body, two focused on his face) captured his face and body movements.<ref name=\"fxguide\" /> ILM returned to create the digital Hulk. [[Jeff White (visual effects)|Jeff White]], ILM's visual effects supervisor, said, \"We really wanted to utilize everything we've developed the last 10 years and make it a pretty spectacular Hulk. One of the great design decisions was to incorporate Mark Ruffalo into the look of him. So, much of Hulk is based on Ruffalo and his performance, not only in motion capture and on set, but down to his eyes, his teeth, and his tongue.\"<ref name=\"AWN\" />\n\nFor ''Thor: Ragnarok'', ILM had to add much more detail to the character's facial features, due to the Hulk's increased dialogue. ILM visual effects supervisor Chad Wiebe explained that Ruffalo's expressions were captured fresh for the film using Medusa, a performance capture technology. With 90 different expressions captured, ILM \"built an entirely new library that would allow [Hulk] to cover a full range of normal human visual characteristics.\"<ref name=\"FXGuidePart2\" /> To help create the Hulk, a person on set was covered in green body paint, and would replicate the intended motions of the character to aid the visual effect artists.<ref name=\"ColliderSep2017Trivia\" /> Additionally, stunt actor Paul Lowe, who is under {{convert|5|ft|m}} tall, stood in for Hemsworth during some of his interactions with the Hulk so that the Hulk's stunt men would be proportionally correct. In some instances when Thor and the Hulk interacted, a digital double was used for Thor, also created by ILM, to have greater flexibility for the shots. ILM worked on all of the Hulk moments in the film outside the final fight sequence, which was completed by Framestore using ILM's assets, as Framestore was primarily responsible for [[Skeletal animation|rigging]] that sequence. Framestore completed nearly 460 shots, which featured digital doubles of Thor and Hela, Fenris, Korg, Miek, the giant Surtur at the end of the film, and over 9,000 buildings for Asgard, based on assets D Negative had from ''The Dark World'', resulting in over 263 character, vehicle, prop, and crowd rigs.<ref name=\"FXGuidePart2\" /> Taika Waititi also provided additional motion capture for the Hulk after Ruffalo had completed his scenes.<ref name=\"WaititiColliderSep2017\" />\n\nWith respect to Bruce Banner's regular appearance, his fashion sense has been critiqued with the observation that \"in just about every appearance, he's wearing a nondescript suit with a purple button down shirt\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/04/a-serious-critique-of-the-mcus-off-duty-fashion.html|title=A Serious Critique of the MCU's Street Style|publisher=[[Vulture.com]]|first=Arye|last=Dworken|date=April 23, 2018}}</ref> By contrast, Banner's \"Professor Hulk\" appearance in ''Avengers: Endgame'', including his penchant for knit sweaters, has been described as \"hot\" and \"sexy\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.popsugar.com/node/46078093|title=Uh, So, There Are a Lot of People Who Think the Hulk Is Hot Now After Seeing Avengers: Endgame|first=Quinn|last=Keaney|date=May 2, 2019|website=POPSUGAR Entertainment}}</ref>\n\n== Marvel Cinematic Universe ==\n=== Feature films ===\n{{Main|The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Avengers (2012 film)|Iron Man 3|Avengers: Age of Ultron|Thor: Ragnarok|Avengers: Infinity War|Captain Marvel (film)|Avengers: Endgame}}\n* [[Edward Norton]] portrays Bruce Banner in ''The Incredible Hulk'' (2008),<ref>{{cite news|date=August 15, 2007 |first=Jay A. |last=Fernandez |title=Signing on to a writing co-op |url=https://articles.latimes.com/2007/aug/15/entertainment/et-scriptland15/ |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=February 20, 2013 |page=[https://articles.latimes.com/2007/aug/15/entertainment/et\u2013scriptland15/2 2] |archivedate=March 13, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100313231243/http://articles.latimes.com/2007/aug/15/entertainment/et-scriptland15 |url-status=live  }}</ref> with [[Lou Ferrigno]] providing the voice of the Hulk.<ref>{{cite news |date=June 12, 2008 |first=Roger |last=Ebert |title=''The Incredible Hulk'' (PG-13) |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080612/REVIEWS/848151866 |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |accessdate=February 23, 2013 |archivedate=June 15, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615030724/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20080612%2FREVIEWS%2F848151866 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n* Norton did not return to the role in ''The Avengers'' (2012),<ref>{{cite web|date=July 10, 2010 |url=http://www.hitfix.com/blogs/motion-captured/posts/exclusive-marvel-confirms-they-will-hire-new-hulk-for-avengers |title=Exclusive: Marvel confirms they will hire new Hulk for ''The Avengers'' |first=Drew |last=McWeeny |publisher=[[HitFix]] |accessdate=July 10, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100712072541/http://www.hitfix.com/blogs/2008-12-6-motion-captured/posts/exclusive-marvel-confirms-they-will-hire-new-hulk-for-avengers |archivedate=July 12, 2010 |url-status=live  }}</ref> being replaced by [[Mark Ruffalo]].<ref name=\"RuffaloAvengers\">{{cite web|date=July 23, 2010 |authorlink=Nikki Finke |last=Finke |first=Nikki |url=https://www.deadline.com/2010/07/toldja-marvel-ruffalo-reach-hulk-deal |title=Toldja!

At Culver University in Virginia, General [[Thunderbolt Ross]] meets with Dr. Bruce Banner, the colleague and boyfriend of his daughter [[Betty Ross|Betty]], regarding an experiment that Ross claims is meant to make humans immune to [[gamma radiation]]. The experiment \u2014 part of a [[World War II]] era \"super soldier\" program that Ross hopes to recreate \u2014 fails, and the exposure to gamma radiation causes Banner to transform into the Hulk for brief periods of time, whenever his heart rate rises above 200. The Hulk destroys the lab and injures or kills the people inside. Banner becomes a fugitive from the U.S. military and Ross in particular, who wants to weaponize the Hulk process.\n\nFive years later,{{efn|According to Leterrier, the film takes place about five years since Banner first transformed. The events of the film also take place simultaneously with the events of ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' (2010) and ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' (2011), set six months after the events of ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008).}} Banner works at a soda bottling factory in [[Rocinha]], [[Rio de Janeiro]] in Brazil, while searching for a cure for his condition. On the Internet, he collaborates with a colleague he knows only as \"Mr. Blue\", and to whom he is \"Mr. Green\". He also learns [[Yoga]] techniques to help keep control, and has not transformed in five months. After Banner cuts his finger, a drop of his blood falls into a bottle, and is eventually ingested by an elderly consumer in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], giving him gamma sickness. Ross tracks down Banner, sending a special forces team, led by Russian-born British [[Royal Marine]] [[Abomination (comics)|Emil Blonsky]], to capture him. Banner transforms into the Hulk and defeats Blonsky's team. Blonsky agrees to be injected with a similar serum, which gives him enhanced speed, strength, agility, and healing, but also begins to deform his skeleton and impair his judgment.\n\nBanner returns to Culver University and reunites with Betty, but is attacked a second time by Ross and Blonsky's forces, again transforming into the Hulk. The Hulk seemingly kills Blonsky and flees with Betty. After the Hulk reverts to Banner, he and Betty go on the run, and Banner contacts Mr. Blue, who urges them to meet him in New York City. Mr. Blue\u2014cellular biologist Dr. [[Leader (comics)|Samuel Sterns]]\u2014has developed a possible antidote to Banner's condition. After a successful test, he warns Banner that the antidote may only reverse each individual transformation. Sterns reveals he has [[organic synthesis|synthesized]] Banner's blood samples, which Banner sent from Brazil, into a large supply, with the intention of applying its \"limitless potential\" to medicine. Fearful of the Hulk's power falling into the military's hands, Banner wishes to destroy the blood supply. Banner is caught and Blonsky has Stern use Banner's blood to turn him into the Abomination. Blonsky then rampages through [[Harlem]]. Realizing that only the Hulk can stop Blonsky, Banner jumps from Ross' helicopter and transforms after hitting the ground. After a long and brutal battle through Harlem, the Hulk defeats Blonsky and flees. Banner soon ends his relationship with Betty, realizing it can no longer work. A month later, in [[Bella Coola, British Columbia]], Banner successfully transforms in a controlled manner. Meanwhile, [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] approaches Ross at a local bar and informs him [[The Avengers (2012 film)|a team]] is being put together.\n\n=== Joining the Avengers ===\nSeveral months later, in response to an attack by the [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]], [[Nick Fury (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Nick Fury]] reactivates the \"Avengers Initiative\", and agent [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]] is sent to [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] to recruit Banner to trace the Tesseract through its [[Gamma ray|gamma radiation]] emissions. Loki is captured and placed in a cell on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s [[Helicarrier]], but agents possessed by Loki attack the Helicarrier, causing Banner to transform into the Hulk. Thor attempts to stop the Hulk's rampage, with Hulk falling to the ground after attacking a S.H.I.E.L.D. fighter jet. When the Avengers regroup in New York City, Banner arrives to join the team to battle a Chitauri invasion. Banner reveals he is \"always angry\", and transforms into the Hulk, fights the Chitauri, beats Loki into submission, and saves Stark from crashing into the ground. Banner later forms a close friendship with Stark and works with him closely, even requesting him to build an anti-Hulk armor to stop him in case he loses control and goes on a rampage.\n\nSome years later, the Avengers recover Loki's scepter, and Stark and Banner discover an [[Artificial intelligence in fiction#Sentient AI|artificial intelligence]] within the scepter's gem, and secretly decide to use it to complete Stark's \"[[Ultron]]\" global defense program. Ultron becomes sentient and recruits the Maximoffs, with [[Wanda Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wanda Maximoff]] using haunting visions to cause the Hulk to rampage until Stark stops him with his [[Iron Man's armor|anti-Hulk armor]]<!-- Please note the term \"Hulkbuster\" is not used in the film -->.{{ref|1|1}} The team then travels to a safehouse, where Romanoff and Banner plan to flee together after realizing a mutual attraction. However, Nick Fury arrives and persuades Romanoff and other team members to form a plan to stop Ultron, resulting in Romanoff being captured and taken to Sokovia. Banner finds her there, but she causes him to transform into the Hulk, in order to fight Ultron. After a final battle defeating Ultron in Sokovia, the Hulk departs in a [[Avengers Quinjet|Quinjet]] and eventually arrives at the planet Sakaar, where he is abducted by the ruler Grandmaster and eventually becomes  his champion and top-fighter in the Contest of Champions.\n\n=== Travels with Thor ===\nTwo years later, [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] crash-lands on Sakaar and is forced to fight Hulk in the Contest of Champions. Summoning lightning, Thor gets the upper hand on Hulk, but the Grandmaster sabotages the fight to ensure Hulk's victory. Still enslaved, Thor attempts to convince Hulk to help him save Asgard, and then escapes the palace and finds the Quinjet that brought Hulk to Sakaar. Hulk follows Thor to the Quinjet, where a recording of Romanoff makes him transform back into Bruce Banner for the first time since Sokovia where Banner is shocked to learn that he is on an alien planet. Banner expresses fear that if he becomes the Hulk again, he will never be able to return to his human form. Escaping Sakaar, they travel to Asgard, where Banner becomes Hulk again to save the fleeing Asgardians from the giant wolf, [[Fenris Wolf (Marvel Comics)|Fenris]], while Thor challenges his sister, Hela. As Asgard is destroyed, the Hulk, remaining in that form, accompanies Thor and the Asgardians on a ship bound for Earth.\n\n=== The Infinity War ===\n[[Thanos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)| Thanos]] and his minions intercept the ship to extract the [[Infinity Stones#Film|Space Stone]] from the [[Cosmic Cube|Tesseract]]. Hulk fights Thanos, but is easily overpowered. [[Heimdall (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Heimdall]] uses the [[Bifr\u00f6st]] to send Hulk to Earth, and Hulk crash-lands at the [[Sanctum Sanctorum]] of [[Stephen Strange (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Stephen Strange]] and his majordomo [[Wong (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wong]] in New York City, and reverts to Bruce Banner. Banner warns Strange about Thanos, and contacts the other Avengers. When minions of Thanos appear in New York to attack Doctor Strange in pursuit of the Time Stone, Banner tries to become the Hulk, but Hulk refuses to \"come out\", forcing Banner out of the action.\n\nBanner and the other Avengers travel to Wakanda, where he uses Stark's [[Hulkbuster armor|anti-Hulk]] armor to battle the invading army of Thanos, until Thanos himself arrives to retrieve the final Infinity Stone, battling the Avengers and trapping Banner, in Stark's armor, in rock. Thanos activates the Infinity Gauntlet and teleports away, as his plan comes to fruition: people begin disintegrating, while Banner and the other Avengers remain on the Wakandan battlefield.\n\nFollowing his struggles with his Hulk side in ''Thor: Ragnarok'' and ''Avengers: Infinity War'', Banner realizes that the Hulk is not a problem to solve, but the solution. During the five years following ''Avengers: Infinity War'', Banner undergoes gamma experimentation to balance his two sides. He is now permanently in the body of the Hulk but with the mind and voice of Banner.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nerdist.com/article/avengers-endgame-hulk-banner-comics/|title=What's Up with Banner and Hulk in Avengers: Endgame?|first1=Rosie|last1=Knight|work=[[Nerdist]]|date=April 25, 2019|accessdate=April 26, 2019}}</ref> When the Avengers travel through time to obtain the Infinity Stones, Banner gets the Time Stone from the [[Ancient One]] (to whom he promises to return the Stones to their respective periods in time when the Avengers are done with their mission) in 2012. He then returns to the present along with the others, and is devastated with Natasha Romanoff's death (she had sacrificed herself so that Clint Barton could earn the Soul Stone). After combining the stones with the Iron Gauntlet, Banner, because of his strength, volunteers to activate the Infinity Stones. He does so and reverses the deaths caused by Thanos at the end of ''Infinity War'', though his right arm gets permanently injured in the process.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cbr.com/joe-russo-confirms-hulk-arm-injury/ |title=Avengers Co-Director Confirms Hulk's Post-Endgame Status |date=May 6, 2019 |website=Comic Book Resources |access-date=May 14, 2019}}</ref> Banner then takes part in the climactic battle against a 2014 version of Thanos and his forces, who are eventually defeated when Tony Stark uses the Infinity Stones, at the cost of his own life. He later attends Stark's funeral along with others. After, he prepares the time machine so that [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]] can return the time-displaced Stones and Mjolnir back to the periods they were found.\n\n== Differences from the comic books ==\nCharles Pulliam-Moore , writing for ''[[Gizmodo]]'', said of the earlier MCU films that \"[w]hile there are a number of storylines from Marvel's comics that delve deeper into the duality of Banner/Hulk's identity... Marvel's movies have forgone those plot lines in favor of trotting Bruce out to babble about science and break things when necessary\".<ref name=\"Gizmodo\" /> One specific difference from the comic books is Banner's involvement in the creation of [[Ultron]] and the [[Vision (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Vision]], a character who in the comics was created solely by Ultron. The Vision, in the films, is created as a counter to Ultron, who had previously been created by Stark and Bruce Banner. In the comics, however, Ultron is created by a different member of the Avengers, Hank Pym.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://screenrant.com/iron-man-worst-changes-from-the-comic-books-to-movies/ |title=Iron Man: 15 Worst Changes From The Comic Books To The Movies |first=Ben |last=Browne |publisher=[[Screen Rant]] |date=January 18, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180114020316/https://screenrant.com/iron-man-worst-changes-from-the-comic-books-to-movies/ |archivedate=January 14, 2018 }}</ref>\n\nDue to the lack of freestanding films about the Hulk, the character has been depicted in very few of the storylines shown in the comic books. In particular, the \"[[Planet Hulk]]\" storyline from the comic books is highly condensed and worked into ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]''; the comic book storyline has the heroes of Earth intentionally sending the Hulk into space due to his excessively dangerous nature,<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #88-91 (Dec 2005-Mar 2006)</ref> while the MCU Hulk leaves Earth of his own accord. The merged Banner/Hulk storyline depicted in ''Avengers: Endgame'' also differs from the comics, where a comparable merger was accomplished by hypnosis performed by superhero psychiatrist [[Doc Samson]].<ref name=\"NewsAramaPg9\">{{cite web|title=Duo Dynamics: The Many Incarnations of HULK-BANNER Bond?

Reviewing ''The Incredible Hulk'', Mark Rahner of ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' wrote that, \"The relaunch of Marvel's green goliath is an improvement over director Ang Lee's ponderous 2003 ''Hulk'' in nearly every way \u2013 except that the actual Hulk still looks scarcely better than something from a video game, and he still barely talks\".<ref name=\"RahnerReview\" /> Conversely, [[Christy Lemire]] of the ''[[Associated Press]]'' found that \"the inevitable comparisons to ''Iron Man'', Marvel Studios' first blockbuster this summer, serve as a glaring reminder of what this Hulk lacks: wit and heart. Despite the presence of Edward Norton, an actor capable of going just as deep as Robert Downey Jr., we don't feel a strong sense of Bruce Banner's inner conflict\".<ref name=\"LemireReview\" />\n\nMark Ruffalo's portrayal of Dr. Bruce Banner/the Hulk in ''The Avengers'' was well received by commentators. Joe Neumaier opined that his performance was superior to the rest of the cast; \"Ruffalo is the revelation, turning Banner into a wry reservoir of calm ready to become a volcano.\"<ref name=\"nydaily2012\" /> Similarly, ''[[The New Yorker]]''{{'s}} [[Anthony Lane]] proclaimed Ruffalo's acting to be one of the film's highlights\u2014alongside Downey.<ref name=\"newyorker2012\" /> ''[[The Village Voice]]''{{'s}} [[Karina Longworth]] concluded: \"Ruffalo successfully refreshes the Hulk myth, playing Banner as an adorably bashful nerd-genius who, in contrast to the preening hunks on the team, knows better than to draw attention to himself.\"<ref name=\"villagevoice\" /> Travers asserted that the actor resonated a \"scruffy warmth and humor\" vibe,<ref name=\"rollz\" /> while Turan felt that he surpassed predecessors Edward Norton and [[Eric Bana]] in playing the character.<ref name=\"LATimes2\" /> Owen Gleiberman of ''Entertainment Weekly'' wrote that \"the smartest thing the filmmakers did was to get Mark Ruffalo to play Bruce Banner as a man so sensitive that he's at war, every moment, with himself. (The film finally solves the Hulk problem: He's a lot more fun in small doses)\".<ref name=\"EW-review\" />\n\n===Accolades===\n{{Anchor|Awards|Accolades}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Built in several phases, they provided a secure connection to the sea even during times of siege. The walls were about 6&nbsp;km in length,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ancient.eu/Piraeus/|title=Piraeus|author=Mark Cartwright|publisher=Ancient History Encyclopedia|date=June 2, 2013|accessdate=February 23, 2016}}</ref> initially constructed in the mid 5th century BC, destroyed by the [[Sparta]]ns in 403 BC after Athens' defeat in the [[Peloponnesian War]], and rebuilt again with Persian support during the [[Corinthian War]] in 395-391 BC. The Long Walls were a key element of Athenian military strategy, since they provided the city with a constant link to the sea and thwarted sieges conducted by land alone.\n\n==History==\n===Background===\n\nThe ancient wall around the [[acropolis]] was destroyed by the [[Achaemenid Dynasty|Persians]] during the occupations of [[Attica]] in 480 and 479 BC, part of the [[Greco-Persian Wars]]. After the [[Battle of Plataea]], the invading Persian forces were removed and the Athenians were free to reoccupy their land and begin rebuilding their city. Early in the process of rebuilding, construction started on new [[Themistoclean Wall|walls]] around the city proper. This project drew opposition from the Spartans and their Peloponnesian allies, who were alarmed by the recent increase in the power of Athens. Spartan envoys urged the Athenians not to go through with the construction, arguing that a walled Athens would be a useful base for an invading army, and that the defenses of the [[Isthmus of Corinth]] would provide a sufficient shield against invaders. However, despite these concerns, the envoys did not strongly protest and in fact gave helpful advice to the builders.  The Athenians disregarded their negative arguments, fully aware that leaving their city unwalled would place them utterly at the mercy of the Peloponnesians;<ref name=\"Fine, The Ancient Greeks, 330\">Fine, ''The Ancient Greeks'', 330</ref>  [[Thucydides]], in his account of these events, describes a series of complex machinations by [[Themistocles]] through which he distracted and delayed the Spartans until the walls were built up high enough to provide adequate protection.<ref>Thucydides, ''The Peloponnesian War'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0199%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D90 1.90\u201391]</ref>\n\n===Beginnings===\nIn the early 450s BC, fighting began between Athens and various Peloponnesian allies of Sparta, particularly [[Corinth]] and [[Aegina]]. In the midst of this fighting between 462 BC and 458 BC, Athens had begun construction of two more walls, the Long Walls, one running from the city to the old port at Phalerum, the other to the newer port at Piraeus. In 457 BC, a Spartan army defeated an Athenian army at [[Battle of Tanagra (457 BC)|Tanagra]] while attempting to prevent the construction, but work on the walls continued and they were completed soon after the battle.<ref name=\"Fine, The Ancient Greeks, 330\"/> These walls ensured that Athens would never be cut off from supplies as long as she controlled the sea.\nThese '''Phase 1a''' walls <ref>Conwell, David H. ''Connecting a City to the Sea: The History of the Athenian Long Walls''. Brill NV, 2008. {{ISBN|978-90-04-16232-7}}</ref> enclosed a vast area and included Athens' two main ports.\n\n===Athenian strategy and politics===\nThe building of the Long Walls reflected a larger strategy that Athens had come to follow in the early 5th century.  Unlike most Greek city states, which specialized in fielding [[Hoplite]] armies, Athens had focused on the navy as the centre of its military since the time of the building of her first fleet during a war with [[Aegina]] in the 480s BC.  With the founding of the [[Delian League]] in 477 BC, Athens became committed to the long term prosecution of a naval war against the Persians.  Over the following decades, the Athenian navy became the mainstay of an increasingly imperial league, and Athenian control of the sea allowed the city to be supplied with grain from the [[Hellespont]] and [[Black Sea]] regions.  The naval policy was not seriously questioned by either democrats or oligarchs during the years between 480 and 462 BC, but later, after [[Thucydides, son of Melesias|Thucydides son of Melesias]] had made opposition to an imperialist policy a rallying cry of the oligarchic faction, the writer known as [[the Old Oligarch]] would identify the navy and democracy as inextricably linked, an inference echoed by modern scholars.<ref>Kagan, in ''The Peloponnesian War'', describes the oligarchy of 411 BC as fundamentally untenable so long as the fleet remained the crucial military arm of Athens.</ref> The long walls were a critical factor in allowing the Athenian fleet to become the city's paramount strength.\n\nWith the building of the Long Walls, Athens essentially became an island within the mainland, in that no strictly land based force could hope to capture it.<ref>Kagan, ''Outbreak of the Peloponnesian War'', 87</ref>  (In ancient Greek warfare, it was all but impossible to take a walled city by any means other than starvation and surrender.)  Thus, Athens could rely on her powerful fleet to keep her safe in any conflict with other cities on the Greek mainland.  The walls were completed in the aftermath of the Athenian defeat at [[Battle of Tanagra (457 BC)|Tanagra]], in which a Spartan army defeated the Athenians in the field but was unable to take the city because of the presence of the city walls; seeking to secure their city even against siege, the Athenians completed the long walls; and, hoping to prevent all invasions of Attica, they also seized Boeotia, which, as they already controlled Megara, put all approaches to Attica in friendly hands.<ref>Kagan, ''Outbreak of the Peloponnesian War'', 95</ref>  For most of the [[First Peloponnesian War]], Athens was indeed unassailable by land, but the loss of Megara and Boeotia at the end of that war forced the Athenians to turn back to the long walls as their source of defense.\n\n===The Middle Wall===\n[[Image:Pelopennesian War, Walls Protecting the City, 431 B.C..JPG|thumb|upright=1.5]]\nDuring the 440's, the Athenians supplemented the existing two Long Walls with a third structure (Phase 1b).<ref>Conwell, ''Connecting a City to the Sea'', 77</ref> This \"Middle Wall\" or \"Southern Wall\" was built to mirror the original Athens-Piraeus Wall and was constructed to be another wall connecting the city to Piraeus. There are many known possibilities for the purpose of the Middle Wall, such as: it was thought to have been built as a back-up defense in case someone penetrated the first Athens-Piraeus Wall. This was proven false however due to the construction of the wall. Its main access points were built so that it would withstand attacks only from the direction of Phaleron. After the naval challenges of 446 BC, Athens was no longer the complete dominant power of the sea, so the Middle Wall is more a backup structure for the Athens-Phaleron Wall. The distance between the two original (phase Ia) walls left a substantial amount of room for amphibious invasions along the coast, and with this new wall, Athenians could retreat within the more narrow area of the two Athens-Piraeus Walls.\n\nAlso by the time the Middle Wall was built, in the mid-fifth century, the importance of the Athenian ports had changed. Piraeus had become the principal economic and military harbor, while Phaleron had begun to lapse into obscurity. This development will have caused a re-evaluation of the fortification system which secured Athens' connection with its ships.<ref>Conwell, ''Connecting a City to the Sea'', 76</ref>\n\n===The Peloponnesian War===\n[[File:Lysander has the walls of Athens demolished.jpg|thumb|[[Lysander]] has the walls of Athens demolished in 404 BC, as a conclusion to the [[Peloponnesian War]].]]\nIn Athens' great conflict with Sparta, the [[Peloponnesian War]] of 432 BC to 404 BC, the walls came to be of paramount importance.  [[Pericles]], the leader of Athens from the start of the war until his death in 429 BC in the [[Plague of Athens|plague that swept Athens]], based his strategy for the conflict around them.  Knowing that the Spartans would attempt to draw the Athenians into a land battle by ravaging their crops, as they had in the 440s, he commanded the Athenians to remain behind the walls and rely on their navy to win the war for them.  As a result, the campaigns of the first few years of the war followed a consistent pattern:  The Spartans would send a land army to ravage Attica, hoping to draw the Athenians out; the Athenians would remain behind their walls, and send a fleet to sack cities and burn crops while sailing around the Peloponnese.  The Athenians were successful in avoiding a land defeat, but suffered heavy losses of crops to the Peloponnesian raids, and their treasury was weakened by the expenditures on the naval expeditions and on import of grain.  Furthermore, a plague ravaged the city in 430 BC and 429 BC, with its effects being worsened by the fact that the entire population of the city was concentrated inside the walls.\n\nThe Athenians continued to use the walls for protection through the first phase of the war until the seizure of Spartan hostages in 425 BC, during the Athenian victory at [[Battle of Pylos|Pylos]].  After that battle, the Spartans were forced to cease their yearly invasions until 413 BC, since the Athenians threatened to kill the hostages if an invasion was launched.\n\nIn the second phase of the war, the walls again became central to the strategy of both sides.  The Spartans occupied a fort at [[Decelea]] in Attica in 413 BC, and placed a force there that posed a year-round threat to Athens. In the face of this army, the Athenians could only supply the city by sea.  Athens was also weakened from the disastrous conclusion of the Sicilian Expedition and began to modify their walls in the summer of 413 BC and ultimately abandoned the Athens-Phaleron Wall, focusing on the two Piraeus Walls.  The Long Walls, and the access to a port that they provided, were by now the only thing protecting Athens from defeat.  Realizing that they could not defeat the Athenians on land alone, the Spartans turned their attention to constructing a navy, and throughout the final phase of the war devoted themselves to trying to defeat the Athenians at sea.  Their eventual success, [[Battle of Aegospotami|Aegospotami]], cut the Athenians off from their supply routes and forced them to surrender.  One of the most important terms of this surrender was the destruction of the long walls which were dismantled in 404 BC. The peace treaty that was reached in the same year also provided the termination of Athens' naval power. Xenophon tells us that the long walls were torn down with much jubilation and to the song of flute girls.\n\n===Rebuilding of the Long Walls===\n[[File:Rebuilding the walls of Athens 393 BCE.jpg|thumb|The [[Achaemenid]] [[Satrap]] of [[Hellespontine Phrygia]] [[Pharnabazus II]] funded the rebuilding the walls of Athens, and provided his seamen as manpower, in 393 BC.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Smith |first1=William |title=A History of Greece from the Earliest Times to the Roman Conquest |date=1877 |publisher=William Ware & Company |page=419 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3oSgAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA419 |language=en}}</ref>]]\nFollowing their defeat in 404, the Athenians quickly regained some of their power and autonomy, and by 403 BC had overthrown the government that the Spartans had imposed on them.  By 395 BC, the Athenians were strong enough to enter into the [[Corinthian War]] as co-belligerents with [[Argos]], [[Corinth]], and [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]] against [[Sparta]].  For the Athenians, the most significant event of this war was the rebuilding of the Long Walls.  By 395 BC the rebuilding of the fortifications had begun and according to the Athenian admiral [[Conon]], the walls had reached their final stages by 391 BC. In 394 BC, a Persian fleet under satrap [[Pharnabazus II]] and [[Conon]] decisively defeated the Spartan fleet at the [[Battle of Cnidus]], and, following this victory, Pharnabazus sent Conon with his fleet to Athens, where it provided aid and protection as the Long Walls were rebuilt.  Thus, by the end of the war, the Athenians had regained the immunity from land assault that the Spartans had taken from them at the end of the Peloponnesian War. The rebuilt walls stood for many years, unchallenged, and were never mentioned to have been incorporated in Athens' defense planning until after the 340s BC.\n\nAccording to Xenophon in ''Hellenica'': \n{{quote|Conon said that if he (Pharnabazus) would allow him to have the fleet, he would maintain it by contributions from the islands and would meanwhile put in at Athens and aid the Athenians in rebuilding their long walls and the wall around Piraeus, adding that he knew nothing could be a heavier blow to the Lacedaemonians than this. (...) Pharnabazus, upon hearing this, eagerly dispatched him to Athens and gave him additional money for the rebuilding of the walls. Upon his arrival Conon erected a large part of the wall, giving his own crews for the work, paying the wages of carpenters and masons, and meeting whatever other expense was necessary. There were some parts of the wall, however, which the Athenians themselves, as well as volunteers from Boeotia and from other states, aided in building.|[[Xenophon]] ''Hellenica'' 4.8.7 4.8.8<ref>{{cite book |last1=Xenophon |title=Perseus Under Philologic: Xen. 4.8.7 |url=http://perseus.uchicago.edu/perseus-cgi/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekFeb2011&query=Xen.%20Hell.%204.8.7&getid=1}}</ref>}}\n\n===The Long Walls in the 4th Century BC===\nFrom the Corinthian War down to the final defeat of the city by [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip of Macedon]], the Long Walls continued to play a central role in Athenian strategy.  The [[Decree of Aristoteles]] in 377 BC reestablished an Athenian league containing many former members of the [[Delian League]].  By the middle of the 4th century, Athens was again the preeminent naval power of the Greek world, and had reestablished the supply routes that allowed it to withstand a land-based siege. The Long Walls had become obsolete  and the length and location of the structures rendered them dangerously vulnerable to the advanced siege techniques of the day. The Athenians began to strengthen their urban defense systems by rebuilding the Long Walls again to be able to withstand contemporary methods of assault in 337 BC. The new walls included attributes such as substructures built of cut blocks and possibly even roofs above the walk-ways. However, the Athenians were not in the position to use the new Long Walls until [[Alexander the Great]]'s death in 323 BC. By this time Athens' navy [[Battle of Amorgos|had been crushed]] in the [[Lamian War]] and they became subordinate to the Macedonians and the use of the Long Walls in a naval strategy was ruled out. Macedonian leaders controlled cities on both sides of the Long Walls and they had little use for these fortifications, thus the mid-fourth century Long Walls were never actually employed.<ref>Conwell, ''Connecting a City to the Sea'', 158</ref>\n\n===Later history===\nThe walls were still standing at the beginning of the 1st century BC. However, during the [[First Mithridatic War]], the [[Siege of Athens and Piraeus (87\u201386 BC)]] was won by the Roman general [[Sulla]] and he destroyed the Long Walls.\n\n==See also==\n* [[City walls of Athens]]\n\n==Sources==\n*[[G.E.M. de Ste.

The Athenians disregarded their negative arguments, fully aware that leaving their city unwalled would place them utterly at the mercy of the Peloponnesians;<ref name=\"Fine, The Ancient Greeks, 330\">Fine, ''The Ancient Greeks'', 330</ref>  [[Thucydides]], in his account of these events, describes a series of complex machinations by [[Themistocles]] through which he distracted and delayed the Spartans until the walls were built up high enough to provide adequate protection.<ref>Thucydides, ''The Peloponnesian War'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0199%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D90 1.90\u201391]</ref>\n\n===Beginnings===\nIn the early 450s BC, fighting began between Athens and various Peloponnesian allies of Sparta, particularly [[Corinth]] and [[Aegina]]. In the midst of this fighting between 462 BC and 458 BC, Athens had begun construction of two more walls, the Long Walls, one running from the city to the old port at Phalerum, the other to the newer port at Piraeus. In 457 BC, a Spartan army defeated an Athenian army at [[Battle of Tanagra (457 BC)|Tanagra]] while attempting to prevent the construction, but work on the walls continued and they were completed soon after the battle.<ref name=\"Fine, The Ancient Greeks, 330\"/> These walls ensured that Athens would never be cut off from supplies as long as she controlled the sea.\nThese '''Phase 1a''' walls <ref>Conwell, David H. ''Connecting a City to the Sea: The History of the Athenian Long Walls''. Brill NV, 2008. {{ISBN|978-90-04-16232-7}}</ref> enclosed a vast area and included Athens two main ports.\n\n===Athenian strategy and politics===\nThe building of the Long Walls reflected a larger strategy that Athens had come to follow in the early 5th century.  Unlike most Greek city states, which specialized in fielding [[Hoplite]] armies, Athens had focused on the navy as the centre of its military since the time of the building of her first fleet during a war with [[Aegina]] in the 480s BC.  With the founding of the [[Delian League]] in 477 BC, Athens became committed to the long term prosecution of a naval war against the Persians.  Over the following decades, the Athenian navy became the mainstay of an increasingly imperial league, and Athenian control of the sea allowed the city to be supplied with grain from the [[Hellespont]] and [[Black Sea]] regions.  The naval policy was not seriously questioned by either democrats or oligarchs during the years between 480 and 462 BC, but later, after [[Thucydides, son of Melesias|Thucydides son of Melesias]] had made opposition to an imperialist policy a rallying cry of the oligarchic faction, the writer known as [[the Old Oligarch]] would identify the navy and democracy as inextricably linked, an inference echoed by modern scholars.<ref>Kagan, in ''The Peloponnesian War'', describes the oligarchy of 411 BC as fundamentally untenable so long as the fleet remained the crucial military arm of Athens.</ref> The long walls were a critical factor in allowing the Athenian fleet to become the city's paramount strength.\n\nWith the building of the Long Walls, Athens essentially became an island within the mainland, in that no strictly land based force could hope to capture it.<ref>Kagan, ''Outbreak of the Peloponnesian War'', 87</ref>  (In ancient Greek warfare, it was all but impossible to take a walled city by any means other than starvation and surrender.)  Thus, Athens could rely on her powerful fleet to keep her safe in any conflict with other cities on the Greek mainland.  The walls were completed in the aftermath of the Athenian defeat at [[Battle of Tanagra (457 BC)|Tanagra]], in which a Spartan army defeated the Athenians in the field but was unable to take the city because of the presence of the city walls; seeking to secure their city even against siege, the Athenians completed the long walls; and, hoping to prevent all invasions of Attica, they also seized Boeotia, which, as they already controlled Megara, put all approaches to Attica in friendly hands.<ref>Kagan, ''Outbreak of the Peloponnesian War'', 95</ref>  For most of the [[First Peloponnesian War]], Athens was indeed unassailable by land, but the loss of Megara and Boeotia at the end of that war forced the Athenians to turn back to the long walls as their source of defense.\n\n===The Middle Wall===\n[[Image:Pelopennesian War, Walls Protecting the City, 431 B.C..JPG|thumb|upright=1.5]]\nDuring the 440's, the Athenians supplemented the existing two Long Walls with a third structure (Phase 1b).<ref>Conwell, ''Connecting a City to the Sea'', 77</ref> This \"Middle Wall\" or \"Southern Wall\" was built to mirror the original Athens-Piraeus Wall and was constructed to be another wall connecting the city to Piraeus. There are many known possibilities for the purpose of the Middle Wall, such as: it was thought to have been built as a back-up defense in case someone penetrated the first Athens-Piraeus Wall. This was proven false however due to the construction of the wall. Its main access points were built so that it would withstand attacks only from the direction of Phaleron. After the naval challenges of 446 BC, Athens was no longer the complete dominant power of the sea, so the Middle Wall is more a backup structure for the Athens-Phaleron Wall. The distance between the two original (phase Ia) walls left a substantial amount of room for amphibious invasions along the coast, and with this new wall, Athenians could retreat within the more narrow area of the two Athens-Piraeus Walls.\n\nAlso by the time the Middle Wall was built, in the mid-fifth century, the importance of the Athenian ports had changed. Piraeus had become the principal economic and military harbor, while Phaleron had begun to lapse into obscurity. This development will have caused a re-evaluation of the fortification system which secured Athens' connection with its ships.<ref>Conwell, ''Connecting a City to the Sea'', 76</ref>\n\n===The Peloponnesian War===\n[[File:Lysander has the walls of Athens demolished.jpg|thumb|[[Lysander]] has the walls of Athens demolished in 404 BC, as a conclusion to the [[Peloponnesian War]].]]\nIn Athens' great conflict with Sparta, the [[Peloponnesian War]] of 432 BC to 404 BC, the walls came to be of paramount importance.  [[Pericles]], the leader of Athens from the start of the war until his death in 429 BC in the [[Plague of Athens|plague that swept Athens]], based his strategy for the conflict around them.  Knowing that the Spartans would attempt to draw the Athenians into a land battle by ravaging their crops, as they had in the 440s, he commanded the Athenians to remain behind the walls and rely on their navy to win the war for them.  As a result, the campaigns of the first few years of the war followed a consistent pattern:  The Spartans would send a land army to ravage Attica, hoping to draw the Athenians out; the Athenians would remain behind their walls, and send a fleet to sack cities and burn crops while sailing around the Peloponnese.  The Athenians were successful in avoiding a land defeat, but suffered heavy losses of crops to the Peloponnesian raids, and their treasury was weakened by the expenditures on the naval expeditions and on import of grain.  Furthermore, a plague ravaged the city in 430 BC and 429 BC, with its effects being worsened by the fact that the entire population of the city was concentrated inside the walls.\n\nThe Athenians continued to use the walls for protection through the first phase of the war until the seizure of Spartan hostages in 425 BC, during the Athenian victory at [[Battle of Pylos|Pylos]].  After that battle, the Spartans were forced to cease their yearly invasions until 413 BC, since the Athenians threatened to kill the hostages if an invasion was launched.\n\nIn the second phase of the war, the walls again became central to the strategy of both sides.  The Spartans occupied a fort at [[Decelea]] in Attica in 413 BC, and placed a force there that posed a year-round threat to Athens. In the face of this army, the Athenians could only supply the city by sea.  Athens was also weakened from the disastrous conclusion of the Sicilian Expedition and began to modify their walls in the summer of 413 BC and ultimately abandoned the Athens-Phaleron Wall, focusing on the two Piraeus Walls.  The Long Walls, and the access to a port that they provided, were by now the only thing protecting Athens from defeat.  Realizing that they could not defeat the Athenians on land alone, the Spartans turned their attention to constructing a navy, and throughout the final phase of the war devoted themselves to trying to defeat the Athenians at sea.  Their eventual success, [[Battle of Aegospotami|Aegospotami]], cut the Athenians off from their supply routes and forced them to surrender.  One of the most important terms of this surrender was the destruction of the long walls which were dismantled in 404 BC. The peace treaty that was reached in the same year also provided the termination of Athens' naval power. Xenophon tells us that the long walls were torn down with much jubilation and to the song of flute girls.\n\n===Rebuilding of the Long Walls===\n[[File:Rebuilding the walls of Athens 393 BCE.jpg|thumb|The [[Achaemenid]] [[Satrap]] of [[Hellespontine Phrygia]] [[Pharnabazus II]] funded the rebuilding the walls of Athens, and provided his seamen as manpower, in 393 BC.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Smith |first1=William |title=A History of Greece from the Earliest Times to the Roman Conquest |date=1877 |publisher=William Ware & Company |page=419 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3oSgAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA419 |language=en}}</ref>]]\nFollowing their defeat in 404, the Athenians quickly regained some of their power and autonomy, and by 403 BC had overthrown the government that the Spartans had imposed on them.  By 395 BC, the Athenians were strong enough to enter into the [[Corinthian War]] as co-belligerents with [[Argos]], [[Corinth]], and [[Thebes (Greece)|Thebes]] against [[Sparta]].  For the Athenians, the most significant event of this war was the rebuilding of the Long Walls.  By 395 BC the rebuilding of the fortifications had begun and according to the Athenian admiral [[Conon]], the walls had reached their final stages by 391 BC. In 394 BC, a Persian fleet under satrap [[Pharnabazus II]] and [[Conon]] decisively defeated the Spartan fleet at the [[Battle of Cnidus]], and, following this victory, Pharnabazus sent Conon with his fleet to Athens, where it provided aid and protection as the Long Walls were rebuilt.  Thus, by the end of the war, the Athenians had regained the immunity from land assault that the Spartans had taken from them at the end of the Peloponnesian War. The rebuilt walls stood for many years, unchallenged, and were never mentioned to have been incorporated in Athens' defense planning until after the 340s BC.\n\nAccording to Xenophon in ''Hellenica'': \n{{quote|Conon said that if he (Pharnabazus) would allow him to have the fleet, he would maintain it by contributions from the islands and would meanwhile put in at Athens and aid the Athenians in rebuilding their long walls and the wall around Piraeus, adding that he knew nothing could be a heavier blow to the Lacedaemonians than this. (...) Pharnabazus, upon hearing this, eagerly dispatched him to Athens and gave him additional money for the rebuilding of the walls. Upon his arrival Conon erected a large part of the wall, giving his own crews for the work, paying the wages of carpenters and masons, and meeting whatever other expense was necessary. There were some parts of the wall, however, which the Athenians themselves, as well as volunteers from Boeotia and from other states, aided in building.|[[Xenophon]] ''Hellenica'' 4.8.7 4.8.8<ref>{{cite book |last1=Xenophon |title=Perseus Under Philologic: Xen. 4.8.7 |url=http://perseus.uchicago.edu/perseus-cgi/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekFeb2011&query=Xen.%20Hell.%204.8.7&getid=1}}</ref>}}\n\n===The Long Walls in the 4th Century BC===\nFrom the Corinthian War down to the final defeat of the city by [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip of Macedon]], the Long Walls continued to play a central role in Athenian strategy.  The [[Decree of Aristoteles]] in 377 BC reestablished an Athenian league containing many former members of the [[Delian League]].  By the middle of the 4th century, Athens was again the preeminent naval power of the Greek world, and had reestablished the supply routes that allowed it to withstand a land-based siege. The Long Walls had become obsolete  and the length and location of the structures rendered them dangerously vulnerable to the advanced siege techniques of the day. The Athenians began to strengthen their urban defense systems by rebuilding the Long Walls again to be able to withstand contemporary methods of assault in 337 BC. The new walls included attributes such as substructures built of cut blocks and possibly even roofs above the walk-ways. However, the Athenians were not in the position to use the new Long Walls until [[Alexander the Great]]'s death in 323 BC. By this time Athens' navy [[Battle of Amorgos|had been crushed]] in the [[Lamian War]] and they became subordinate to the Macedonians and the use of the Long Walls in a naval strategy was ruled out. Macedonian leaders controlled cities on both sides of the Long Walls and they had little use for these fortifications, thus the mid-fourth century Long Walls were never actually employed.<ref>Conwell, ''Connecting a City to the Sea'', 158</ref>\n\n===Later history===\nThe walls were still standing at the beginning of the 1st century BC. However, during the [[First Mithridatic War]], the [[Siege of Athens and Piraeus (87\u201386 BC)]] was won by the Roman general [[Sulla]] and he destroyed the Long Walls.\n\n==See also==\n* [[City walls of Athens]]\n\n==Sources==\n*[[G.E.M. de Ste.

Arunkumar. Production began in September 2018, and the film released worldwide on 24 January 2020.\n\n==Plot==\nThe movie opens with the psycho beheading a woman. Gautham ([[Udhayanidhi Stalin]]), a blind musician, is in love with a radio jockey named Dahini ([[Aditi Rao Hydari]]). After multiple attempts by Gautham, Dahini finally understands his true love and asks him to meet her at a place that she will be talking about in her radio session. Gautham listens to the radio all day and manages to find the place, which is a train subway. Dahini, hopefully waiting for him, sees the psycho-killer all of a sudden. She feels afraid and tries to escape, but the psycho manages to sedate her. \n\nGautham reaches the place in time but fails to save her due to his blindness. However, using his sense of smell, he realizes that something is wrong. The psycho later spares Gautham's life and takes Dahini to his secret lair. The next day, the police goes to Gautham and extracts information from him. A total of 14 girls were abducted, 13 of whom got murdered, and the recently kidnapped Dahini. Gautham soon realizes that the police cannot find anything, and he decides to seek out and save Dahini on his own terms. The psycho is about to behead Dahini, but he notices that there is no sense of fear in her. He asks her for the reason, to which she replies that Gautham will find her within a week regardless of her death and that the psycho will be answering for his crimes soon. The psycho leaves her chained to a wall and accepts that as a challenge. Gautham uses various methods to find the killer with the help of Kamala ([[Nithya Menen]]), a handicapped ex-police officer who was previously dealing with the case. Together, they both deduce that the psycho must be a rich man who owns pig farms using the smell from the decayed bodies of the murdered girls. Realizing that Gautham is getting closer to him, the psycho goes on a killing spree. Gautham, Kamala and their associates all visit and enquire the owners of pig farms in the area, but they have failed in their attempts. Depressed, Gautham goes to his house and stays there alone. The psycho visits him, and Gautham acknowledges his presence. However, Gautham's friend Rajanayakam ([[Singampuli]]) defends him and tries to chase down the psycho in his car. \n\nUnfortuntely, the psycho hides himself in a dense area of tall grass and finally manages to kill Rajanayakam. The next day, Gautham mourns over the death of his friend and plans to drop his plan due to a large number of people's deaths. Later, Kamala reveals that she had prior notice that the killer had gone to a college function. With regained hope, they all go back to the college and look at the recordings during that day. They manage to find someone suspicious, but his face got blurred. However, they notice a college staff sitting beside him. \n\nUsing relevant information from him, they manage to find the killer. In the meantime, Dahini manages to go around the psycho's lair and sees a jailed woman and a dead police corpse. She reveals to her that the psycho was her former student at an orphanage and the psycho used to masturbate, so she used to beat him 60 times everyday, for all 365 days in a year for his mistake. Around 11:45 PM, Gautham reaches the psycho's lair. The psycho is about to behead Dahini when the intruder alarms go off. The enraged psycho runs to kill Gautham, but eventually, Gautham manages to cuff the psycho's leg. Gautham later runs and rescues Dahini. They both manage to run away.\n\nHowever, the psycho begs out, \"Teacher, please don't leave me alone here\". Dahini, who sees the light in him, places the keys to the cuff a few metres in front of him. Later, they both escape together with Kamala. The psycho is about to take the key, but the imprisoned teacher takes the key and swallows it, trying to punish him. The psycho gets infuriated and tears her stomach to get the key. He later releases himself and runs to find them both. Fortunately, they both leave, and he screams as he failed.\n\nLater on, it is evident that Dahini has been affected by the [[Stockholm Syndrome]], as she sympathizes with the psychopath when questioned by the press and refuses to consider him a killer but understands his innocent heart filled with pain and if it was his mother or sister, she would have cared for him so that he would not have become the killer that he was. The psycho sees the interview and realizes his mistakes after finally feeling loved by someone. The movie ends of with the psycho falling off a cliff with a smile on his face with the song ''Thai Madiyil'' (Mother's Affection).\n\nAccording to Mysskin, the film is inspired from a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] tale on [[A\u1e45gulim\u0101la]], an important figure in the religion.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mysskin's Psycho based on Buddhist tale of Angulimala.

Arunkumar. Production began in September 2018, and the film released worldwide on 24 January 2020.\n\n==Plot==\nThe movie opens with the psycho beheading a woman. Gautham ([[Udhayanidhi Stalin]]), a blind musician, is in love with a radio jockey named Dahini ([[Aditi Rao Hydari]]). After multiple attempts by Gautham, Dahini finally understands his true love and asks him to meet her at a place that she will be talking about in her radio session. Gautham listens to the radio all day and manages to find the place, which is a train subway. Dahini, hopefully waiting for him, sees the psycho-killer all of a sudden. She feels afraid and tries to escape, but the psycho manages to sedate her. \n\nGautham reaches the place in time but fails to save her due to his blindness. However, using his sense of smell, he realizes that something is wrong. The psycho later spares Gautham's life and takes Dahini to his secret lair. The next day, the police goes to Gautham and extracts information from him. A total of 14 girls were abducted, 13 of whom got murdered, and the recently kidnapped Dahini. Gautham soon realizes that the police cannot find anything, and he decides to seek out and save Dahini on his own terms. The psycho is about to behead Dahini, but he notices that there is no sense of fear in her. He asks her for the reason, to which she replies that Gautham will find her within a week regardless of her death and that the psycho will be answering for his crimes soon. The psycho leaves her chained to a wall and accepts that as a challenge. Gautham uses various methods to find the killer with the help of Kamala ([[Nithya Menen]]), a handicapped ex-police officer who was previously dealing with the case. Together, they both deduce that the psycho must be a rich man who owns pig farms using the smell from the decayed bodies of the murdered girls. Realizing that Gautham is getting closer to him, the psycho goes on a killing spree. Gautham, Kamala and their associates all visit and enquire the owners of pig farms in the area, but they have failed in their attempts. Depressed, Gautham goes to his house and stays there alone. The psycho visits him, and Gautham acknowledges his presence. However, Gautham's friend Rajanayakam ([[Singampuli]]) defends him and tries to chase down the psycho in his car. \n\nUnfortuntely, the psycho hides himself in a dense area of tall grass and finally manages to kill Rajanayakam. The next day, Gautham mourns over the death of his friend and plans to drop his plan due to a large number of people's deaths. Later, Kamala reveals that she had prior notice that the killer had gone to a college function. With regained hope, they all go back to the college and look at the recordings during that day. They manage to find someone suspicious, but his face got blurred. However, they notice a college staff sitting beside him. \n\nUsing relevant information from him, they manage to find the killer. In the meantime, Dahini manages to go around the psycho's lair and sees a jailed woman and a dead police corpse. She reveals to her that the psycho was her former student at an orphanage and that she used to beat him 60 times, everyday, for all 365 days in a year, even for the slightest mistake. Around 11:45 PM, Gautham reaches the psycho's lair. The psycho is about to behead Dahini when the intruder alarms go off. The enraged psycho runs to kill Gautham, but eventually, Gautham manages to cuff the psycho's leg. Gautham later runs and rescues Dahini. They both manage to run away.\n\nHowever, the psycho begs out, \"Teacher, please don't leave me alone here\". Dahini, who sees the light in him, places the keys to the cuff a few metres in front of him. Later, they both escape together with Kamala. The psycho is about to take the key, but the imprisoned teacher takes the key and swallows it, trying to punish him. The psycho gets infuriated and tears her stomach to get the key. He later releases himself and runs to find them both. Fortunately, they both leave, and he screams as he failed.\n\nLater on, it is evident that Dahini has been affected by the [[Stockholm Syndrome]], as she sympathizes with the psychopath when questioned by the press and refuses to consider him a killer but understands his innocent heart filled with pain and if it was his mother or sister, she would have cared for him so that he would not have become the killer that he was. The psycho sees the interview and realizes his mistakes after finally feeling loved by someone. The movie ends of with the psycho falling off a cliff with a smile on his face with the song ''Thai Madiyil'' (Mother's Affection).\n\nAccording to Mysskin, the film is inspired from a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] tale on [[A\u1e45gulim\u0101la]], an important figure in the religion.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mysskin's Psycho based on Buddhist tale of Angulimala.

It is calculated as the time from the start of the '''Q wave''' to the end of the '''T wave''', and approximates to the time taken from when the [[Ventricle (heart)|cardiac ventricles]] start to contract to when they finish relaxing. An abnormally long or abnormally short QT interval is associated with an increased risk of developing [[Heart arrhythmia|abnormal heart rhythms]] and [[Cardiac arrest|sudden cardiac death]]. Abnormalities in the QT interval can be caused by [[Genetics|genetic]] conditions such as [[long QT syndrome]], by certain medications such as [[sotalol]] or [[pitolisant]], by disturbances in the concentrations of certain [[Electrolyte|salts]] within the blood such as [[Hypokalemia|hypokalaemia]], or by [[Endocrine disease|hormonal imbalances]] such as [[hypothyroidism]].\n\n==Measurement==\n[[File:QT interval measurement.jpg|left|thumb|Illustrations of the tangent and threshold methods of measuring the QT interval]]\nThe QT interval is most commonly measured in lead II for evaluation of serial ECGs, with leads I and V5 being comparable alternatives to lead II. Leads III, aVL and V1 are generally avoided for measurement of QT interval.<ref name=\"interval\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Panicker GK, Salvi V, Karnad DR, Chakraborty S, Manohar D, Lokhandwala Y, Kothari S|year=2014|title=Drug-induced QT prolongation when QT interval is measured in each of the 12 ECG leads in men and women in a thorough QT study.|journal=J Electrocardiol|volume=47|issue=47(2)|pages=155\u2013157|doi=10.1016/j.jelectrocard.2013.11.004|pmid=24388488}}</ref> The accurate measurement of the QT interval is subjective<ref name=\"subjective\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Panicker GK, Karnad DR, Joshi R, Shetty S, Vyas N, Kothari S, Narula D|year=2009|title=Z-score for benchmarking reader competence in a central ECG laboratory|journal=Ann Noninvasive Electrocardiol|volume=14|issue=14(1)|pages=19\u201325|doi=10.1111/j.1542-474X.2008.00269.x|pmid=19149789|pmc=6932360}}</ref> because the end of the T wave is not always clearly defined and usually merges gradually with the baseline. QT interval in an ECG complex can be measured manually by different methods, such as the threshold method, in which the end of the T wave is determined by the point at which the component of the T wave merges with the isoelectric baseline, or the tangent method, in which the end of the T wave is determined by the intersection of a tangent line extrapolated from the T wave at the point of maximum downslope to the isoelectric baseline.<ref name=\"tangent method\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Panicker GK, Karnad DR, Natekar M, Kothari S, Narula D, Lokhandwala Y|year=2009|title=Intra- and interreader variability in QT interval measurement by tangent and threshold methods in a central electrocardiogram laboratory|journal=J Electrocardiol|volume=42|issue=42(4)|pages=348\u201352|doi=10.1016/j.jelectrocard.2009.01.003|pmid=19261293}}</ref>\n\nWith the increased availability of digital ECGs with simultaneous 12-channel recording, QT measurement may also be done by the 'superimposed median beat' method.

It is calculated as the time from the start of the '''Q wave''' to the end of the '''T wave''', and approximates to the time taken from when the [[Ventricle (heart)|cardiac ventricles]] start to contract to when they finish relaxing. An abnormally long or abnormally short QT interval is associated with an increased risk of developing [[Heart arrhythmia|abnormal heart rhythms]] and [[Cardiac arrest|sudden cardiac death]]. Abnormalities in the QT interval can be caused by [[Genetics|genetic]] conditions such as [[long QT syndrome]], by certain medications such as [[sotalol]] or [[pitolisant]], by disturbances in the concentrations of certain [[Electrolyte|salts]] within the blood such as [[Hypokalemia|hypokalaemia]], or by [[Endocrine disease|hormonal imbalances]] such as [[hypothyroidism]].\n\n==Measurement==\n[[File:QT interval measurement.jpg|left|thumb|Illustrations of the tangent and threshold methods of measuring the QT interval]]\nThe QT interval is most commonly measured in lead II for evaluation of serial ECGs, with leads I and V5 being comparable alternatives to lead II.

Ivan leaves the room while Raymond talks with Delaney and learns that she came to Erinsborough to see Leo Tanaka, as she fell in love with him while he was working at Raymond's club in Sydney. She then tells him that Leo was the one who went to the police about his money laundering, not Mannix. Raymond and Ivan decide to shoot Leo, and Raymond tells Ivan to get Leo alone so there are no witnesses. Ivan finds Leo in The Waterhole and fires the gun, but Terese Willis jumps in front of Leo taking the bullet. Ivan flees the scene and calls Raymond to tell him what happened. Raymond leaves Delaney and comes down to the complex, where he spots Leo and the police. He enters Harold's Caf\u00e9 and the customers assume he is just a hotel guest. [[Mark Brennan (Neighbours)|Mark Brennan]] ([[Scott McGregor (model)|Scott McGregor]]) and [[Ned Willis]] (Ben Hall) find Ivan on Power Road trying to break into a car. Mark confronts him and Ned tackles him to the ground.\n\nRaymond tries to leave the caf\u00e9, but [[Elly Conway]] ([[Jodi Anasta]]) tells him to stay put as the police are continuing to sweep the area for Ivan's partner. She later tells him that he can go, but he notices that she does not tell anyone else and realises that she knows the police are looking for him. He pulls out his gun and orders Elly to collect all the phones, [[Yashvi Rebecchi]] (Olivia Junkeer) to lock the door and [[Chloe Brennan (Neighbours)|Chloe Brennan]] ([[April Rose Pengilly]]) to barricade it. He then hears [[Kirsha Rebecchi]] (Vani Dhir) on the phone to the police. He orders everyone to get on the ground, and asks the police to get him a van. Elly convinces him that he cannot take all the hostages with him, and he eventually lets an older couple and the children go. She tells him to just take her with him, but Chloe argues that he should take her instead. Raymond fires the gun at the ceiling and tells them to shut up. Leo comes to the caf\u00e9 and Raymond lets him inside, where he confronts his role in sending him and Ivan to prison. Leo asks him to think about Delaney, but Raymond refuses to listen and raises his gun to shoot just as the police come inside and tackle him to the ground.

Aaron later talks with Vera about how he and David have fallen in love with Regina, and he offers to buy her. Vera tells him that Regina was bequeathed to her, and if he wants Regina then they will have to go through a judge. David and Aaron eventually decide to let Regina go with Vera, who presents them with a vets bill before leaving for Bendigo. Vera later meets with [[Melissa Lohan]] (Jacqui Purvis) about selling Valerie's house. She then walks through the Lassiter's complex where [[Leo Tanaka]] (Tim Kano) is vandalising a Valentine's Day display. He throws a large floral display which hits Vera and knocks her to the ground. Leo's family see that she is okay and ask her not to call the police. [[Sheila Canning]] ([[Colette Mann]]) talks with Vera and asks her not to sue Leo. She mentions that his father [[Paul Robinson (Neighbours)|Paul Robinson]] ([[Stefan Dennis]]) is actually the one with the money, and implies the accident could have happened to anyone with all the decorations hanging up, so Vera sues Lassiters. Vera comes to Lassiters to hear a public apology from Leo, but he gets into an argument with Paul and [[Terese Willis]] ([[Rebekah Elmaloglou]]), causing Vera to leave.

Mel comes to [[Ramsay Street]] to see Chloe, who shuts the door on her and refuses to talk to her. Mel tells Aaron that she is remorseful for stealing from Chloe and leaving her in debt, so he arranges for them to talk. Mel apologises to Chloe for leaving her and tells her she will pay her back. Chloe and Mel agree to be friends again. Mel reads about the Robinson Pines housing development and introduces herself to Paul Robinson in the hope of securing a job as a sales agent, but Paul turns her down as his daughter [[Amy Williams (Neighbours)|Amy Williams]] ([[Zoe Cramond]]) has a team in place. Mel later comes by to see Chloe, who is about to send out an email invitation to the Robinson Pines sale, and she manages changes the time while Chloe is out of the room. The following day, Mel comes by the sale and helps Amy and Paul out by talking to potential investors, leading Paul to offer her a job as sales manager.

She also convinces Paul to extend Robinson Pines and she meets with [[Lucas Fitzgerald]] ([[Scott Major]]) to discuss selling his garage.\n\nDuring an outing to the beach, Chloe tells Mel that she has been diagnosed with [[Huntington's disease]]. Mel's supportive response leads Chloe to give their relationship a second chance.

When he tells her that the apprentice [[Bea Nilsson]] ([[Bonnie Anderson (singer)|Bonnie Anderson]]) is rebooking the cancelled job, she asks for his keys and starts a fire at the garage with a faulty power board, unaware that Bea is sleeping inside a van. Bea accuses Mel of starting the fire, after seeing her giving money to Heath. Lucas later agrees to sell the garage, along with other Power Road business owners. Chloe also accuses Mel of starting the fire, after learning that she threw out a faulty power board from Number 24. Mel denies everything, but Chloe tells her that she no longer trusts her and ends their relationship. Mel replies that no one will want Chloe when she becomes sick and leaves. Elly confronts Mel the following day for almost killing her sister, but Mel accuses her of undermining her relationship with Chloe, and threatens to tell Mark about the kiss.

They tell Paul and Terese that they are staying with friends, and set up camp away from the others. Harlow sends Gary a text message about Prue's lies. Harlow feels pressured to have sex by Hendrix and they argue. She leaves and comes across Bea, who is trapped in a mineshaft with a broken leg. Harlow jumps down to help, but she also becomes trapped. Finn returns to check if Bea is still alive and throw rocks down. He then throws a snake down, which bites Harlow when she and Bea try to catch it in a rucksack. Gary tries to save them, but is killed by Finn, who also pushes Elly into the mineshaft. The others eventually find them, and they jump down to avoid a fire that engulfs the island. After being rescued, Harlow is taken to Erinsborough Hospital and placed in an induced coma. Paul blames Hendrix for Harlow's condition and initially bans him from seeing her. After waking up from her coma, Harlow listens to a voicemail on her phone, that was left by Prue and hears an explosion. She asks Paul where her mother is, and he tells her that she died. They later learn that she was killed by a bomb that Finn had left for Paul's sister [[Lucy Robinson (Neighbours)|Lucy Robinson]] ([[Melissa Bell (actor)|Melissa Bell]]).\n\nHarlow was discharged from the hospital, but still mourn over the loss of her mother. Harlow kept Prue's final voice message from her phone and kept listening to it. Harlow drops her phone, and Paul and Terese learn that Harlow's been listening to Prue's voice message. Paul tries to take her phone and with a struggle, Paul accidentally deletes the message, upsetting Harlow. [[Mark Brennan (Neighbours)|Mark Brennan]], was told by Hendrix of the incident and tells Harlow that the police has a copy of Prue's message and offers to give Harlow a copy of it, which is she accepts. Roxy hosts a memorial party for Prue, and Harlow was unable to join, but with some encouragement from Hendrix, Harlow joins the party. That night, Harlow walks Hendrix home, where she decided to sleep with him and they had sex. The next day, Harlow realised she regret about sleeping with Hendrix and told Terese and Roxy, but is unaware that Paul overheard it and confronts Hendrix on his own. Harlow is furious when Paul accuses Hendrix for taking advantage of her and threatening him to stay away. Harlow apologises to Hendrix for Paul's behaviour, but still clashes with Paul for being unfair with Hendrix and purposely rips and scribbles Paul's paperwork. Harlow gets involved with a police raid with Mackenzie when the police raided inside Mackenzie's apartment that she shares with Mannix Foster, who is a criminal. Harlow continues to clash with Paul and refuses to talk to him. After getting some advice from David, Harlow apologises to Paul and they made peace, but she quickly learns from David, who confronts Paul for making Aaron hide stolen goods, that Mannix stole.\n\n==Mackenzie Hargreaves==\n{{Infobox soap character\n| series = Neighbours\n| name = Mackenzie Hargreaves\n| portrayer = [[Georgie Stone]]\n| introducer = [[Jason Herbison]]\n| first = {{start date|2019|8|30|df=y}}\n| classification = [[List of Neighbours characters#Present characters|Current; regular]]\n| spinoffs= ''[[Neighbours: Erinsborough High]]'' (2019)\n| occupation = Student\n| home = [[Ramsay Street#No. 30|30 Ramsay Street]]\n| mother = Sarah Hargreaves\n| father = [[#Grant Hargreaves|Grant Hargreaves]]\n| aunts = [[List of Neighbours characters (2020)#Trish Symington|Trish Symington]]\n}}\n'''Mackenzie Hargreaves''', played by [[Georgie Stone]], made her first appearance on 30 August 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/neighbours/a28729021/neighbours-spoilers-elly-suffers-another-baby-scare|title=Neighbours spoiler: Elly suffers another baby scare|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=20 August 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"WW\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nowtolove.com.au/celebrity/tv/neighbours-mackenzie-georgie-stone-57103|title=Exclusive: Meet Georgie Stone, the amazing transgender activist about to star on Neighbours|date=22 July 2019|work=[[The Australian Women's Weekly]]|accessdate=22 July 2019}}</ref> She is the show's first transgender character,<ref name=\"Anderton\"/> and the second trans actress to portray a trans character on Australian television.<ref name=\"WW\"/> Stone's casting was announced on 23 March 2019.<ref name=\"Anderton\">{{cite web|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/neighbours/a26915706/neighbours-first-transgender-character-georgie-stone-guest-role/|title=Neighbours to introduce its first transgender character as Georgie Stone joins the soap in guest role|last=Anderton|first=Joe|date=23 March 2019|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=18 June 2019}}</ref> She had approached the show about introducing a transgender character in 2018.

When Yashvi fails an English test, Mackenzie suggests that she asks to resit it and explain the reason why she failed. Yashvi is sure she knows Mackenzie from some where, but Mackenzie assures her that they have never met and she has never lived in Bourke, where Yashvi and her family are from. However, Mackenzie later hides a Bourke keyring in her pocket, which later falls out in the cafe owned by Yashvi's parents. Fellow student [[#Richie Amblin|Richie Amblin]] (Lachlan Miller) asks Mackenzie to the school dance, but she turns him down as she might be gone by the time it happens. Mackenzie later comes to Yashvi's father [[Shane Rebecchi]] (Nicholas Coghlan) and tells him that he used to know her mother, Sarah, and he was the reason she wanted to go to Erinsborough High. She asks him to find her father [[#Grant Hargreaves|Grant Hargreaves]] ([[Paul Mercurio]]), who she has not seen in years. When Yashvi suspects that Mackenzie is Shane's love child, he asks her to tell his family who she is. Mackenzie explains to Yashvi that she used to know her as Michael, and she tells the Rebecchi family that she has always known that she was a girl, but her father struggled to accept her, so she and her mother moved away. Now, she wants her father in her life. Yashvi apologises for jumping to conclusions.\n\nMackenzie panics when someone overhears Yashvi mention that she is trans, as she was bullied at her last school. Yashvi works out that it was Richie and accidentally outs Mackenzie while arguing with him. Mackenzie rejects Yashvi's apology, as she feels Yashvi does not know what she is apologising for. She also tells Principal [[Susan Kennedy]] ([[Jackie Woodburne]]) that she plans to stay at the school. Mackenzie later explains to Yashvi that not only did she out her, but she said that Mackenzie used to be a boy, which she finds offensive as she has always been a girl. She accepts Yashvi's apology, but asks for some time. Mackenzie and Yashvi reconcile after Yashvi tries to remove some transphobic graffiti from the girls' toilet door. Shortly after, Mackenzie finds a threatening note in her locker and Susan suggests Mackenzie use the disabled toilets, until the culprit has been found. Yashvi leads the students in a protest against the injustice, which Richie joins, much to the disdain of his friend [[#Ollie Sudekis|Ollie Sudekis]] (Ellmir Asipi). Susan realises that she has made a mistake and apologises to Mackenzie. Ollie makes transphobic comments to Mackenzie, resulting in Shane pushing him up against a wall. Mackenzie is grateful for Shane's support.\n\nAt [[Sheila Canning]]'s ([[Colette Mann]]) birthday party, Mackenzie meets and flirts with [[Hendrix Greyson]] (Benny Turland). She tells him that she is transgender, and he says it does not change anything, before they kiss. Shane gets a strong lead on Grant's whereabouts, and Mackenzie tells him about the day her father burnt all her feminine belongings. Shane later admits that he told Grant she was transgender. Shane's wife [[Dipi Rebecchi]] (Sharon Johal) finds Mackenzie at a butterfly house, and convinces her to come back to Erinsborough. Mackenzie tells her that she cannot forgive Shane and will not speak to him again. Hendrix manipulates Mackenzie into asking him to the school formal. Shane and Dipi inform Mackenzie that Grant is coming to Erinsborough. Mackenzie's first interaction with her father is awkward, as he calls her by her old name. Grant says that Mackenzie is and always will be male to him, causing her to walk out. Yashvi and Harlow comfort her, and when she meets with Grant again, he makes an effort by calling her Mackenzie. She invites him to the school dance, but he fails to turn up and leaves town. Mackenzie neglects Hendrix to spend time with Yashvi and Harlow, and she later sees him kissing [[#Olivia Lane|Olivia Lane]] (Grace O'Sullivan). Shane dances with Mackenzie during the father-daughter dance. She forgives him and assures him that Grant's views are not his responsibility. Mackenzie asserts that although she has not reconciled with her father, she still feels like she has found family in Erinsborough.\n\nIn the spin-off ''Erinsborough High'', Mackenzie and Richie admit their feelings for each other and begin dating, despite her concerns about Richie being more sexually experienced than she is. Before she can tell him that she has not had [[gender reassignment surgery]], Richie tells her that he knows as he did some research, and he still wants date her. The following year, Mackenzie helps Harlow with her unexpected feelings for Hendrix. She contemplates studying law after finishing school, and asks [[Toadie Rebecchi]] ([[Ryan Moloney]]) for advice. Mackenzie attends The Waterhole's Mardi Gras party and tells Hendrix to treat Harlow right, after learning they have feelings for each other. Mackenzie's aunt [[List of Neighbours characters (2020)#Trish Symington|Trish Symington]] (Katherine Tonkin) plans to move to Fremantle, but Mackenzie refuses to go and decides to ask the Rebecchis if she can stay with them, however, she realises that they are grieving for a friend and decides not to approach them. [[Roxy Willis]] (Zima Anderson) helps Mackenzie convince Trish that she is living at Number 22, while she secretly stays in Trish's apartment. As she struggles alone, Roxy suggests Mackenzie gets a housemate and [[Mannix Foster]] (Sam Webb) moves in. Mackenzie is suspicious of Mannix when he puts a lock on his bedroom door and wants to be informed if guests are coming over. While Harlow is visiting, the police raid the apartment and Mackenzie learns that Mannix is a criminal.

He hands her a tissue and decides to keep her company. Scarlett explains that her fianc\u00e9 Rex called off their wedding in the middle of the ceremony, and she has maxed out her credit card paying for a flight home. Ned buys them some drinks. Scarlett sees Ned's phone passcode as he enters it, and later deletes a text message about an available flight. Before Ned leaves for a hotel, they take a selfie together. A week later, Scarlett comes to Erinsborough and Ned notices her in the local cafe. She tells him that she is on a personal tour of the country and thought she would start with Erinsborough after he told her about it. Realising that Ned works at Lassiters Hotel, Scarlett mentions that she has plenty of hospitality experience. She later places a suitcase behind porter [[#Trevor Nugent|Trevor Nugent]] (Warwick Sadler), causing him to trip over. With Trevor hospitalised, Ned offers Scarlett a job covering his shifts. To thank him, Scarlett buys them lunch, which is interrupted by Ned's girlfriend [[Yashvi Rebecchi]] (Olivia Junkeer). After they leave, Scarlett looks at a scrapbook, which contains information about her failed wedding and deceased family, and admires the selfie she took of herself and Ned. When Scarlett mentions that she is lonely, Ned gives her a tour of the area and they book dinner for three at [[Erinsborough#The 82|The 82]]. Scarlett attempts to cause trouble between Ned and Yashvi by bringing up their age gap, before mentioning that she and Ned met at the airport, which upsets Yashvi as Ned did not tell her. \n\nScarlett tries to befriend Yashvi and moves into the spare room at Number 32 Ramsay Street. She spies on Ned while he showering and takes photos of him. After learning about how protective Ned can be around his former girlfriend [[Bea Nilsson]] ([[Bonnie Anderson (singer)|Bonnie Anderson]]), Scarlett sabotages Bea's microphone lead and calls Ned to The Waterhole on the pretext of a mix up with his shifts. Just as he goes to leave, Bea receives an electric shock. Ned helps break the connection and takes her to the hospital, making him late to meet Yashvi. Scarlett gives Yashvi an edited version of what happened to Bea and plays up Ned's involvement in helping her, which leads to them taking a break from their relationship. Scarlett uses the opportunity to get closer to Ned, and she learns that Bea has developed a heart arrhythmia from the electric shock. Scarlett soon declares that her former boyfriend Rex is stalking her, and Ned offers to stay over at Number 32 for the night.

He accidentally spills soda in his lap, causing him to lose control of the car and he crashes into a marquee at Lassiters, injuring Harlow. Pierce threatens to report him to the police, but when Harlow's grandfather [[Paul Robinson (Neighbours)|Paul Robinson]] ([[Stefan Dennis]]) confronts Hendrix, Pierce takes the blame, saying he asked Hendrix to park his car.

Prue asks after Harlow, and learns that she has not mentioned Prue much. Prue explains that she is in the wellness industry and tells Paul and Terese about the philosophies she lives her life by. Prue notices a man, Graham, watching her and cuts the meeting short. As she walks off, Graham asks how it went and Prue tells him that Paul and Terese seem kind and are looking after Harlow. He then tells her that it is time to let Harlow go because if she is not with them, she is against them. Prue sends Harlow a text asking her not to worry if she does not hear from her for a while. Just over a month later, Prue comes to Erinsborough and voices her disapproval about Harlow's living arrangement, as Paul and Terese's hotel has been caught up in a sex tape scandal.

Prue befriends [[Gary Canning]] ([[Damien Richardson (actor)|Damien Richardson]]) at The Waterhole and they go on several dates. Harlow worries that her mother has forgotten her, but Prue makes sure to prioritise her and they start to reconnect. \n\nPrue receives phone calls from the Restoration Order demanding payment, and she is tempted to steal from the till at The 82, but Gary catches her.

Gary asks to hear more about the Order and he later lends her the money she needs. Prue also attempts to convince Harlow that they could make a good life for themselves in London. When she catches Terese drinking wine, knowing that she is an alcoholic, Prue asks her to support her plan to take Harlow home to the UK and Terese agrees.

However, as they stop at a [[milk bar]], Harlow recalls Prue telling Terese to \"trust in the process\" and realises that she is still in the Order.

She begs her mother to stay in Erinsborough with her, but Prue leaves her outside the shop and flies back to London.\n\nThe following year, Prue returns to Erinsborough claiming that she has left the Restoration Order. She tries to repair her relationship with Harlow. During a barbecue at the Cannings, Prue and Gary announce that they are engaged, shocking Harlow and Gary's family. After attempting to rebuild her relationship with Harlow, it is revealed that Prue did not leave the Order \u2013 rather, she was forced out due to a lack of finances. Upon finding out, Gary calls off the wedding and decides to join his son on the glamping trip. Prue takes the box containing their honeymoon destination and follows him in her car.

They do not get a chance to talk to Robert, who leaves when his father Paul Robinson enters the room. Harlow tells David, Aaron and Paul that she is Robert's daughter, and that her mother met him while backpacking in Tasmania. They invite her to stay with them in Erinsborough. Paul introduces Harlow to his fianc\u00e9e, [[Terese Willis]] ([[Rebekah Elmaloglou]]), who she instantly bonds with, and invites her to live with them, after she says she wants to get to know Paul for herself. Paul initially struggles to talk to Harlow about Robert, but he eventually gives her a letter he wrote to his son that explains their relationship. Terese's niece [[Roxy Willis]] (Zima Anderson) takes an instant dislike to Harlow and the two girls struggle to get along. Harlow enrols at Erinsborough High and befriends [[Yashvi Rebecchi]] (Olivia Junkeer). After Paul is attacked, Roxy claims that [[Gary Canning]] ([[Damien Richardson (actor)|Damien Richardson]]) is responsible. Harlow notices that Gary's mother [[Sheila Canning]] ([[Colette Mann]]) is nervous and soon finds that she has hidden a bloodied crowbar in her recycling bin. Harlow hands it into the police, who arrest Sheila. Roxy soon confesses that her former boyfriend attacked Paul. Harlow later calls out Roxy's immature behaviour when she realises Roxy has not apologised to Gary.\n\nTerese gives Harlow and Roxy the use of her daughter's car, Hermione, causing them to clash again when Roxy gives it a make-over. After Roxy tries on Terese's wedding dress and rips it, Harlow tells Terese what happened, but is surprised when Terese accepts that it was just an accident. When Roxy confronts her for telling Terese, Harlow throws food at her and they fight. They are interrupted by the arrival of Harlow's grandmother, [[Gail Lewis]] ([[Fiona Corke]]). Gail plans to take Harlow to Tasmania with her, after seeing how bad the relationship between her and Roxy is. She changes her mind when she learns that Harlow is doing well in school and wants to stay in Erinsborough. Harlow discovers Roxy has a casual relationship with [[Mark Brennan (Neighbours)|Mark Brennan]] ([[Scott McGregor (model)|Scott McGregor]]) and blackmails Roxy into doing her chores and giving her custody of the car. She also learns that Gail was involved in a conspiracy against Paul and encourages Gail to go and be with her daughter New York. She later tells [[Ned Willis]] (Ben Hall) that she thought Gail came to Erinsborough to get to know her. Ned encourages her to say goodbye to Gail properly. While Terese and Paul are honeymooning in London, they decide to meet Harlow's mother, [[#Prue Wallace|Prue Wallace]] ([[Denise van Outen]]). Harlow tries to put them off and tells [[Amy Williams (Neighbours)|Amy Williams]] ([[Zoe Cramond]]) that Prue is in a cult. After Mark publicly humiliates Roxy, Harlow and Sheila encourage her to end the relationship, which she does.\n\nHarlow repeatedly clashes with [[Hendrix Greyson]] (Benny Turland), who attempts to sabotage her presentation at school. During the school dance, Harlow confronts Hendrix for kissing [[Olivia Lane]] (Grace O'Sullivan) in front of his date [[Mackenzie Hargreaves]] ([[Georgie Stone]]). Olivia accuses Harlow for being jealous, and Hendrix kisses her. She then slaps him. During a Melbourne Cup event at Lassiters, Harlow is injured when Hendrix crashes into a marquee, trapping her inside. Roxy frees her and Harlow thanks her for caring. She refuses to accept Hendrix's half-hearted apology. Days later, Harlow and Roxy find the Melbourne Cup trophy in the boot of their car. After taking some photos with it, they bring it back to Terese, who initially accuses Roxy of taking it, however, Harlow believes it was Hendrix and CCTV confirms he was responsible.\n\nWhen David gets involved in a hit-and-run accident, and needs a kidney transplant, Harlow couldn't be tested, as she's a minor. As non of the David's family members are a possible match for David, Harlow decide to turns to Robert, but Paul disagrees on her idea, but she went to him anyway, with Roxy. When Paul finds out, he is furious at Harlow for disobeying him, but agrees as David is running out of time. Robert goes to the hospital with the police, but later escapes. He calls Harlow to meet him, and she agrees to go. Harlow persuade him to save David, and he returns to the hospital with Harlow and the police. The surgery became a success and Robert returns to prison and David is recovering. Harlow decides to get private tutoring lessons and ask former school teacher [[Finn Kelly]]) [[Rob Mills]]) to tutor her. Harlow develop a crush on Hendrix and tells Mackenzie about her crush on Hendrix, [[Karl Kennedy]], overheard her and mistook her having a crush on Finn and told Finn's girlfriend, [[Bea Nilsson]] ([[Bonnie Anderson (singer)|Bonnie Anderson]]). Harlow heard what happened and informs Bea that she doesn't have a crush on Finn, and Bea believes her.\n\nHarlow became suspicious of Hendrix, when he shows up to her home, shirtless and tries to seduce him in a classroom, but he pulls away and Harlow admits to him that she doesn't like him that way. However, her feelings for Hendrix continues. While practicing her driving lessons with Terese, Harlow accidentally hit and killed Terese's daughter [[Piper Willis]]' (Mavournee Hazel) cat, Clementine, while reversing the car through the driveway. Hendrix, who has a close bond with Clementine, blames Harlow for her death. Harlow decide to hold a funeral for Clementine and invites Hendrix to say goodbye. After burying Clementine, Hendrix apologises to Harlow for being harsh and Harlow gives Hendrix one of Clementine's toys. They almost kiss, but Harlow sneezes at Hendrix's face. Harlow attends to the Waterhole Mardi Gras party with Mackenzie and overheard Paul and Gary arguing about Prue returning to Erinsborough and is mad at Gary for not telling her. Hendrix comforts Harlow and they share a kiss. Harlow began to avoid Hendrix's texts, as she is stressed about her mother's return to Erinsborough, but later told Hendrix the reason why she didn't answer his messages.\n\nWhen Prue arrives, Harlow struggles to trust her, but she attends a welcome barbecue with Paul and Terese. There, Gary and Pure announce they are engaged. Harlow and Gary's son, [[Kyle Canning]] ([[Chris Milligan]]) are opposed to the engagement and the wedding, which is happening at the Lassiter's Wedding Expo. Harlow and Hendrix talk about their kiss and she gently rejects him, preferring them to stay frenemies, which he accepts. Hendrix later tells her that he wants to earn her trust and asks her out on a date, which is a success. Prue convinces Harlow to be there at her wedding, but while planning Prue's hen's party, Harlow discovers a notification of an email from the Order on her mother's laptop. She realises that her mother lied to her and Gary about leaving the Order and she confronts Prue, before being comforted by Hendrix.\n\nHarlow and Hendrix decide to travel to [[Pierce Greyson]]'s ([[Tim Robards]]) island, where some of their friends and neighbours have gathered for [[Elly Conway]]'s ([[Jodi Anasta]]) birthday. They tell Paul and Terese that they are staying with friends, and set up camp away from the others. Harlow sends Gary a text message about Prue's lies. Harlow feels pressured to have sex by Hendrix and they argue. She leaves and comes across Bea, who is trapped in a mineshaft with a broken leg. Harlow jumps down to help, but she also becomes trapped. Finn returns to check if Bea is still alive and throw rocks down. He then throws a snake down, which bites Harlow when she and Bea try to catch it in a rucksack. Gary tries to save them, but is killed by Finn, who also pushes Elly into the mineshaft. The others eventually find them, and they jump down to avoid a fire that engulfs the island. After being rescued, Harlow is taken to Erinsborough Hospital and placed in an induced coma. Paul blames Hendrix for Harlow's condition and initially bans him from seeing her. After waking up from her coma, Harlow listens to a voicemail on her phone, that was left by Prue and hears an explosion. She asks Paul where her mother is, and he tells her that she died. They later learn that she was killed by a bomb that Finn had left for Paul's sister [[Lucy Robinson (Neighbours)|Lucy Robinson]] ([[Melissa Bell (actor)|Melissa Bell]]).\n\nHarlow was discharged from the hospital, but still mourn over the loss of her mother. Harlow kept Prue's final voice message from her phone and kept listening to it. Harlow drops her phone, and Paul and Terese learn that Harlow's been listening to Prue's voice message. Paul tries to take her phone and with a struggle, Paul accidentally deletes the message, upsetting Harlow. [[Mark Brennan (Neighbours)|Mark Brennan]], was told by Hendrix of the incident and tells Harlow that the police has a copy of Prue's message and offers to give Harlow a copy of it, which is she accepts. Roxy hosts a memorial party for Prue, and Harlow was unable to join, but with some encouragement from Hendrix, Harlow joins the party. That night, Harlow walks Hendrix home, where she decided to sleep with him and they had sex. The next day, Harlow realised she regret about sleeping with Hendrix and told Terese and Roxy, but is unaware that Paul overheard it and confronts Hendrix on his own. Harlow is furious when Paul accuses Hendrix for taking advantage of her and threatening him to stay away. Harlow apologises to Hendrix for Paul's behaviour, but still clashes with Paul for being unfair with Hendrix and purposely rips and scribbles Paul's paperwork. Harlow gets involved with a police raid with Mackenzie when the police raided inside Mackenzie's apartment that she shares with Mannix Foster, who is a criminal. Harlow continues to clash with Paul and refuses to talk to him. After getting some advice from David, Harlow apologises to Paul and they made peace, but she quickly learns from David, who confronts Paul for making Aaron hide stolen goods, that Mannix stole.\n\n==Mackenzie Hargreaves==\n{{Infobox soap character\n| series = Neighbours\n| name = Mackenzie Hargreaves\n| portrayer = [[Georgie Stone]]\n| introducer = [[Jason Herbison]]\n| first = {{start date|2019|8|30|df=y}}\n| classification = [[List of Neighbours characters#Present characters|Current; regular]]\n| spinoffs= ''[[Neighbours: Erinsborough High]]'' (2019)\n| occupation = Student\n| home = [[Ramsay Street#No. 30|30 Ramsay Street]]\n| mother = Sarah Hargreaves\n| father = [[#Grant Hargreaves|Grant Hargreaves]]\n| aunts = [[List of Neighbours characters (2020)#Trish Symington|Trish Symington]]\n}}\n'''Mackenzie Hargreaves''', played by [[Georgie Stone]], made her first appearance on 30 August 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/neighbours/a28729021/neighbours-spoilers-elly-suffers-another-baby-scare|title=Neighbours spoiler: Elly suffers another baby scare|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=20 August 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"WW\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nowtolove.com.au/celebrity/tv/neighbours-mackenzie-georgie-stone-57103|title=Exclusive: Meet Georgie Stone, the amazing transgender activist about to star on Neighbours|date=22 July 2019|work=[[The Australian Women's Weekly]]|accessdate=22 July 2019}}</ref> She is the show's first transgender character,<ref name=\"Anderton\"/> and the second trans actress to portray a trans character on Australian television.<ref name=\"WW\"/> Stone's casting was announced on 23 March 2019.<ref name=\"Anderton\">{{cite web|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/neighbours/a26915706/neighbours-first-transgender-character-georgie-stone-guest-role/|title=Neighbours to introduce its first transgender character as Georgie Stone joins the soap in guest role|last=Anderton|first=Joe|date=23 March 2019|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=18 June 2019}}</ref> She had approached the show about introducing a transgender character in 2018.

When Yashvi fails an English test, Mackenzie suggests that she asks to resit it and explain the reason why she failed. Yashvi is sure she knows Mackenzie from some where, but Mackenzie assures her that they have never met and she has never lived in Bourke, where Yashvi and her family are from. However, Mackenzie later hides a Bourke keyring in her pocket, which later falls out in the cafe owned by Yashvi's parents. Fellow student [[#Richie Amblin|Richie Amblin]] (Lachlan Miller) asks Mackenzie to the school dance, but she turns him down as she might be gone by the time it happens. Mackenzie later comes to Yashvi's father [[Shane Rebecchi]] (Nicholas Coghlan) and tells him that he used to know her mother, Sarah, and he was the reason she wanted to go to Erinsborough High. She asks him to find her father [[#Grant Hargreaves|Grant Hargreaves]] ([[Paul Mercurio]]), who she has not seen in years. When Yashvi suspects that Mackenzie is Shane's love child, he asks her to tell his family who she is. Mackenzie explains to Yashvi that she used to know her as Michael, and she tells the Rebecchi family that she has always known that she was a girl, but her father struggled to accept her, so she and her mother moved away. Now, she wants her father in her life. Yashvi apologises for jumping to conclusions.\n\nMackenzie panics when someone overhears Yashvi mention that she is trans, as she was bullied at her last school. Yashvi works out that it was Richie and accidentally outs Mackenzie while arguing with him. Mackenzie rejects Yashvi's apology, as she feels Yashvi does not know what she is apologising for. She also tells Principal [[Susan Kennedy]] ([[Jackie Woodburne]]) that she plans to stay at the school. Mackenzie later explains to Yashvi that not only did she out her, but she said that Mackenzie used to be a boy, which she finds offensive as she has always been a girl. She accepts Yashvi's apology, but asks for some time. Mackenzie and Yashvi reconcile after Yashvi tries to remove some transphobic graffiti from the girls' toilet door. Shortly after, Mackenzie finds a threatening note in her locker and Susan suggests Mackenzie use the disabled toilets, until the culprit has been found. Yashvi leads the students in a protest against the injustice, which Richie joins, much to the disdain of his friend [[#Ollie Sudekis|Ollie Sudekis]] (Ellmir Asipi). Susan realises that she has made a mistake and apologises to Mackenzie. Ollie makes transphobic comments to Mackenzie, resulting in Shane pushing him up against a wall. Mackenzie is grateful for Shane's support.\n\nAt [[Sheila Canning]]'s ([[Colette Mann]]) birthday party, Mackenzie meets and flirts with [[Hendrix Greyson]] (Benny Turland). She tells him that she is transgender, and he says it does not change anything, before they kiss. Shane gets a strong lead on Grant's whereabouts, and Mackenzie tells him about the day her father burnt all her feminine belongings. Shane later admits that he told Grant she was transgender. Shane's wife [[Dipi Rebecchi]] (Sharon Johal) finds Mackenzie at a butterfly house, and convinces her to come back to Erinsborough. Mackenzie tells her that she cannot forgive Shane and will not speak to him again. Hendrix manipulates Mackenzie into asking him to the school formal. Shane and Dipi inform Mackenzie that Grant is coming to Erinsborough. Mackenzie's first interaction with her father is awkward, as he calls her by her old name. Grant says that Mackenzie is and always will be male to him, causing her to walk out. Yashvi and Harlow comfort her, and when she meets with Grant again, he makes an effort by calling her Mackenzie. She invites him to the school dance, but he fails to turn up and leaves town. Mackenzie neglects Hendrix to spend time with Yashvi and Harlow, and she later sees him kissing [[#Olivia Lane|Olivia Lane]] (Grace O'Sullivan). Shane dances with Mackenzie during the father-daughter dance. She forgives him and assures him that Grant's views are not his responsibility. Mackenzie asserts that although she has not reconciled with her father, she still feels like she has found family in Erinsborough.\n\nIn the spin-off ''Erinsborough High'', Mackenzie and Richie admit their feelings for each other and begin dating, despite her concerns about Richie being more sexually experienced than she is. Before she can tell him that she has not had [[gender reassignment surgery]], Richie tells her that he knows as he did some research, and he still wants date her. The following year, Mackenzie helps Harlow with her unexpected feelings for Hendrix. She contemplates studying law after finishing school, and asks [[Toadie Rebecchi]] ([[Ryan Moloney]]) for advice. Mackenzie attends The Waterhole's Mardi Gras party and tells Hendrix to treat Harlow right, after learning they have feelings for each other. Mackenzie's aunt [[List of Neighbours characters (2020)#Trish Symington|Trish Symington]] (Katherine Tonkin) plans to move to Fremantle, but Mackenzie refuses to go and decides to ask the Rebecchis if she can stay with them, however, she realises that they are grieving for a friend and decides not to approach them. [[Roxy Willis]] (Zima Anderson) helps Mackenzie convince Trish that she is living at Number 22, while she secretly stays in Trish's apartment. As she struggles alone, Roxy suggests Mackenzie gets a housemate and [[Mannix Foster]] (Sam Webb) moves in. Mackenzie is suspicious of Mannix when he puts a lock on his bedroom door and wants to be informed if guests are coming over. While Harlow is visiting, the police raid the apartment and Mackenzie learns that Mannix is a criminal. Shane and Dipi invite Mackenzie to stay with them and she accepts.\n\n==Scarlett Brady==\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series = Neighbours\n|name = Scarlett Brady\n|portrayer = [[Christie Whelan Browne]]\n|introducer = [[Jason Herbison]]\n|first = {{start date|2019|9|9|df=y}}\n|last = {{end date|2019|10|31|df=y}}\n|classification = [[Recurring characters of Neighbours#B|Former; recurring]]\n|occupation = Porter\n}}\n'''Scarlett Brady''', played by [[Christie Whelan Browne]], made her first appearance on 9 September 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/neighbours/a28882381/neighbours-spoilers-ned-willis-scarlett-brady-meet/|title=Neighbours hints at trouble for Ned Willis as newcomer Scarlett arrives|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=1 September 2019|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=1 September 2019}}</ref> Whelan Browne's casting and her character details were announced on 17 June 2019.<ref name=\"Haddrick\">{{cite web|url=https://www.newidea.com.au/australian-actress-christie-whelan-browne-to-join-neighbours-cast|title=Christie Whelan Browne announces she is joining this popular Aussie soap|last=Haddrick|first=Milly|date=17 June 2019|work=[[New Idea]]|accessdate=17 June 2019}}</ref> She admitted that was lucky to get the role and was unsure as to how it happened.

A week later, Scarlett comes to Erinsborough and Ned notices her in the local cafe. She tells him that she is on a personal tour of the country and thought she would start with Erinsborough after he told her about it. Realising that Ned works at Lassiters Hotel, Scarlett mentions that she has plenty of hospitality experience. She later places a suitcase behind porter [[#Trevor Nugent|Trevor Nugent]] (Warwick Sadler), causing him to trip over. With Trevor hospitalised, Ned offers Scarlett a job covering his shifts. To thank him, Scarlett buys them lunch, which is interrupted by Ned's girlfriend [[Yashvi Rebecchi]] (Olivia Junkeer). After they leave, Scarlett looks at a scrapbook, which contains information about her failed wedding and deceased family, and admires the selfie she took of herself and Ned.

Just as he goes to leave, Bea receives an electric shock. Ned helps break the connection and takes her to the hospital, making him late to meet Yashvi. Scarlett gives Yashvi an edited version of what happened to Bea and plays up Ned's involvement in helping her, which leads to them taking a break from their relationship. Scarlett uses the opportunity to get closer to Ned, and she learns that Bea has developed a heart arrhythmia from the electric shock. Scarlett soon declares that her former boyfriend Rex is stalking her, and Ned offers to stay over at Number 32 for the night. When she learns Yashvi is coming over, Scarlett lays down next to a sleeping Ned on the couch, so Yashvi catches them together. Yashvi then breaks up with Ned. Scarlett claims Rex has threatened her, and she later pays someone to throw a brick through the kitchen window, so Ned will stay with her. Scarlett initiates a kiss between them and they have sex, but Scarlett notices that Ned regrets it. She then tells Yashvi what happened and pretends to be attracted to [[Kyle Canning]] ([[Chris Milligan]]) to make Ned jealous. \n\n[[Paul Robinson (Neighbours)|Paul Robinson]] ([[Stefan Dennis]]) learns that Scarlett has lied about working in hotels and attempts to fire her, but she reveals that she found a hidden camera in one of the rooms and will go to the press if he does. Scarlett pretends that she has lost her phone at The 82 and while she and Ned are looking for it, he is struck by a speeding motorbike and suffers a dislocated shoulder. Scarlett insists that Ned moves into Number 32 and she soon seduces him. Yashvi confronts Scarlett about her former boyfriend [[#Scott Mayfair|Scott Mayfair]] (Tom Jackson), who says that she tried to kill him, but Scarlett insists that Scott is lying. She then convinces Ned to leave town for a country B&B. To celebrate Halloween, Ned and Scarlett dress up, but Ned is thrown when Scarlett wears a wedding dress and starts talking about their future. Scarlett tells Ned they are meant to be together, but when he tries to leave, she stabs him with a cheese knife. She then chases Ned through the maze, as Bea and Yashvi enter to rescue Ned. Scarlett slashes Yashvi's leg, while Bea helps Ned to escape. He collapses by a tree, where Scarlett finds him and attempts to kill him. Yashvi tackles her to the ground and Scarlett is arrested. At the police station, Paul turns up to goad Scarlett, who replies with \"trick or treat\". Paul later learns that the footage from the hidden camera has been given to the press.\n\n==Hendrix Greyson==\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series = Neighbours\n|name = Hendrix Greyson\n|portrayer = Benny Turland\n|introducer = [[Jason Herbison]]\n|first = {{start date|2019|9|13|df=y}}\n|classification = [[List of Neighbours characters#Present characters|Current; regular]]\n|spinoffs = ''[[Neighbours: Erinsborough High]]'' (2019)\n|occupation = Student \n|home = [[Ramsay Street#No. 24|24 Ramsay Street]]\n|father = [[Pierce Greyson]]\n|mother = [[Lisa Rowsthorn]]\n|stepmother = [[Chloe Brennan (Neighbours)|Chloe Brennan]]\n|sisters = Alana Greyson\n}}\n'''Hendrix Greyson''', played by Benny Turland, made his first appearance on 13 September 2019.<ref name=\"Son\">{{cite web|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/neighbours/a28882514/neighbours-spoilers-pierce-greyson-son-hendrix/|title=Neighbours bringing in Pierce Greyson's son as new regular character|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=1 September 2019|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=1 September 2019}}</ref> The character and Turland's casting was announced on 1 September.

In the films, Loki is known as the \"God of Mischief\", and is one of the most powerful of the [[Asgardians (comics)|Asgardians]], an alien civilization with long ties to Earth, who are therefore considered by some on Earth to be gods.\n\n{{As of|2019}}, the character is an important recurring figure of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. He has appeared in six films of the series, ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'', ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'', ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'', ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'', ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'', and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', and will appear in a stand-alone [[Disney+]] television series focused on the character. Loki's character has borrowed a number of characteristics and storylines from across the more than fifty-year history of the character in Marvel Comics. As in the comics, Loki has generally been a villain in the MCU, variously attempting to conquer Asgard or Earth, and having allied himself with more powerful villains to achieve his aims. He has particular antagonism for his adoptive brother [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]], and is known to variously ally with and then betray Thor and others, and to regularly return from apparent death. Later on in his development in the films, he becomes less of a [[supervillain]] and more of an [[antihero]].\n\n==Concept and creation==\nThe mythical figure, Loki, actually preceded Thor in making his first Marvel Comics appearance, depicted in the [[science fiction]]/[[fantasy]] [[anthology]] title [[Timely Comics]]' publication ''[[Venus (comic book)|Venus]]'' No. 6 (August 1949) as a member of the [[Olympians (Marvel Comics)|Olympian gods]] exiled to the [[Hades|Underworld]]. However, the current version of Loki made his first official Marvel appearance was in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' No. 85 (October 1962), where Loki was reintroduced as Thor's sworn enemy. The modern age Loki was introduced by brothers and co-writers [[Stan Lee]] and [[Larry Lieber]] and he was redesigned by [[Jack Kirby]]. As one of Thor's arch-nemeses, Loki frequently made appearances in Thor-related titles like ''Journey into Mystery'' and ''Thor'', as well as other [[Marvel Universe]] titles such as ''[[Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' and ''[[X-Men]]''.<ref>''X-Men and Alpha Flight'' No. 1 (December 1985)</ref> As well as brief appearances in the ''[[Spider-Man]]'' and ''[[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]'' comic series.\n\nLive-action film adaptations of character in the ''Thor'' comic books were proposed at various times, but did not come to fruition. In the mid-2000s, [[Kevin Feige]] realized that Marvel still owned the rights to the core members of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], which included Thor. Feige, a self-professed \"fanboy\", envisioned creating a shared universe just as creators Stan Lee and Jack Kirby had done with their comic books in the early 1960s.<ref name=\"BostonApril2012\">{{cite web|date=April 25, 2012 |last=Russo |first=Tom |title=SUPER GROUP |url=https://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2012/04/29/the_avengers_collects_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbustersuper_groupthe_avengers_assembles_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbuster/ |publisher=[[Boston.com]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6LK5iBg53?url=http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2012/04/29/the_avengers_collects_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbustersuper_groupthe_avengers_assembles_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbuster/?page=1 |archivedate=November 22, 2013 |url-status=live  }}</ref> In 2006, the film was announced as a Marvel Studios production.<ref name=\"Carle\">{{cite news|first=Chris |last=Carle |title=Comic-Con 2006: Marvel Announces Three |work=IGN |date=July 3, 2006 |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/720/720532p1.html |accessdate=August 10, 2008 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zxByL7iA?url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/720/720532p1.html |archivedate=July 5, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> In December 2007, Protosevich described his plans for it \"to be like a [[superhero]] [[origin story]], but not one about a human gaining super powers, but of a god realizing his true potential.

Odin uses magic to make Loki appear Asgardian, and raises him as a son alongside Odin's biological son, Thor. During his upbringing, Odin's wife Freya teaches Loki to use magic and illusion.\n\nHundreds of years later, Loki watches as Thor prepares to ascend to the throne of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]]. This is interrupted by frost giants attempting to retrieve an artifact captured by Odin in a war centuries before. Loki manipulates Thor into traveling to Jotunheim against Odin's order, to confront Frost Giant leader Laufey, accompanied by Loki and several of Thor's fellow warriors. A battle ensues until Odin intervenes to save the Asgardians, destroying the fragile truce between the two races. Loki discovers that he is Laufey's biological son, adopted by Odin after the war ended. After Odin exiles Thor to Earth, Loki confronts Odin about his parentage, and a weary Odin falls into the deep \"Odinsleep\" to recover his strength. Loki takes the throne in Odin's stead and offers Laufey the chance to kill Odin and retrieve the Casket. Sif and the Warriors Three, unhappy with Loki's rule, attempt to return Thor from exile, convincing [[Heimdall (comics)|Heimdall]], gatekeeper of the [[Bifr\u00f6st]]\u2014the means of traveling between worlds\u2014to allow them passage to Earth. Aware of their plan, Loki sends the [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]], a seemingly indestructible [[automaton]], to pursue them and kill Thor, but Thor regains his powers and defeats the Destroyer. Thor leaves with his fellow Asgardians to confront Loki.\n\nIn Asgard, Loki betrays and kills Laufey, revealing his true plan to use Laufey's attempt on Odin's life as an excuse to destroy Jotunheim with the Bifr\u00f6st Bridge, thus proving himself worthy to his adoptive father. Thor arrives and fights Loki before destroying the [[Bifr\u00f6st Bridge]] to stop Loki's plan, stranding himself in Asgard. Odin awakens and prevents the brothers from falling into the abyss created in the wake of the bridge's destruction, but Loki apparently commits suicide by allowing himself to fall when Odin rejects his pleas for approval.\n\nIn space, Loki encounters the Other, the leader of an extraterrestrial race known as the [[Chitauri]].

Later, [[Erik Selvig]] is taken to a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility, where Nick Fury opens a briefcase and asks him to study a mysterious cube, which [[Nick Fury]] says may hold untold power. Loki, invisible, prompts Selvig to agree, and he does.\n\n===Attacking Earth===\n{{see|The Avengers (2012 film)}}\nLoki attacks a remote [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] research facility, using his scepter to enslave the mind of [[Clint Barton (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Clint Barton]] and steals the Tesseract. In [[Stuttgart]], Barton steals [[iridium]] needed to stabilize the Tesseract's power while Loki causes a distraction, leading to a brief confrontation with Steve Rogers, Tony Stark, and Natasha Romanoff that ends with Loki's surrender. While Loki is being escorted to S.H.I.E.L.D., [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] arrives and frees him, hoping to convince him to abandon his plan and return to Asgard. After a confrontation with Stark and Rogers, Thor agrees to take Loki to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s flying aircraft carrier, the [[Helicarrier]]. Upon arrival, Loki is imprisoned while Banner and Stark attempt to locate the Tesseract.\n\nAgents possessed by Loki attack the Helicarrier, disabling one of its engines in flight and causing [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]] to transform into the Hulk. Thor attempts to stop the Hulk's rampage, and Loki kills Agent Coulson and ejects Thor from the airship as he escapes. Stark and Rogers realize that for Loki, simply defeating them will not be enough; he needs to overpower them publicly to validate himself as ruler of Earth. Loki uses the Tesseract, in conjunction with a device Selvig built, to open a wormhole above [[Stark Tower]] in [[New York City]] to the Chitauri fleet in space, launching his invasion. The Avengers arrive and rally in defense of the city. As the Chitauri are defeated, the Hulk attacks Loki and beats him into submission. Thor returns Loki and the Tesseract to Asgard.\n\n===Battle with the Dark Elves===\n{{see|Thor: The Dark World}}\n[[Elves (Marvel Comics)#Dark Elves|Dark Elves]] led by [[Malekith the Accursed|Malekith]] attack Asgard, searching for Jane Foster, whose body has been invaded by an unearthly force known as the Aether. Malekith and his monstrous lieutenant Kurse kill Loki's adoptive mother [[Frigga (comics)|Frigga]], who had taught Loki magic. Thor reluctantly frees Loki, who knows a secret portal to [[Svartalfheim]], home of the dark elves, in return for Thor's promise to take vengeance for their mother.\n\nIn Svartalfheim, Loki appears to betray Thor, in fact tricking Malekith into drawing the Aether out of Jane, but Thor's attempt to destroy the exposed substance fails. Malekith merges with the Aether and leaves in his ship as Loki appears to be fatally wounded saving Thor from Kurse, whom Loki was able to kill through trickery. Thor ultimately defeats Malekith in a battle in [[Greenwich]], and returns to Asgard to decline Odin's offer to take the throne, and tells Odin of Loki's sacrifice. After Thor leaves, it is shown that Loki has actually survived and taken Odin's place on the throne, disguised as Odin.\n\n===Destruction of Asgard and battle with Thanos===\n{{see|Thor: Ragnarok|Avengers: Infinity War|Avengers: Endgame}}\nSeveral years later, Loki continues to rule Asgard disguised as Odin, having kept the real Odin under a spell in a nursing home in New York City. Thor returns to Asgard and discovers this ruse. He takes Loki to New York, and with the help of [[Doctor Strange|Stephen Strange]], they find a dying Odin in Norway, who explains that his passing will allow his firstborn child, Hela, to escape from a prison she was sealed in long ago. She appears, destroying Mj\u00f6lnir, and forces the escaping Thor and Loki from the Bifr\u00f6st out into space.\n\nLoki lands on the planet Sakaar, and quickly ingratiates himself to the ruler of that world, the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]]. Thor later crash-lands on the planet, and is captured by the slave trader [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]], a former member of the ancient order of [[Valkyrior|Valkyries]] defeated by Hela. After convincing Valkyrie and Loki to help, they steal a ship with which to escape through a wormhole to Asgard \u2013 but not before Loki again attempts to betray his brother, causing Thor to leave Loki behind on Sakaar. In the midst of a battle with Hela's forces, Loki returns aboard a large vessel stolen from the Grandmaster, helping Asgard's citizens to escape the battle between Thor and Hela's forces, and proclaiming himself their savior. Loki helps defeat Hela by rushing to Odin's treasure room and placing the crown of Surtur in the eternal flame kept there, thus causing an enormous form of Surtur to appear and destroy Asgard, which is Hela's source of power. Thor, crowned king, decides to take his people to Earth despite Loki's concerns about how he will be received there, but they are intercepted by a large spacecraft carrying Thanos.\n\nThanos, wielding the Power Stone after an assault on Xandar, overpowers Thor and Hulk, and claims the Space Stone from the Tesseract, which Loki had stolen just before Asgard's destruction. In a last act of self-sacrifice, Loki pretends to swear allegiance to Thanos, only to attempt a futile attack, after which Thanos chokes Loki to death.\n\n===Alternative timeline===\n{{see|Loki (TV series)}}\nThanos eventually obtains all the Infinity Stones and snaps his fingers and destroys half the population of the universe. Five years later, the remaining Avengers figure out how to travel back in time to obtain the Infinity Stones before Thanos does to undo the snap, leading several of them to return to the Battle of New York. The plans of the time-travelling Avengers go awry, however, allowing the now-captured past version of Loki to get hold of the Space Stone and escape, forming a new timeline where Loki is again alive.\n\n==Reception==\nThe character of Loki \"has been a fan favorite ever since his central role in 2012's ''The Avengers''\",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/loki-tv-show-questions-answers-death-tesseract/|title=Loki TV Show Answers Tom Hiddleston's Death & Tesseract Questions|first=Kyle|last=Morris|publisher=[[ScreenRant]]|date=September 18, 2019}}</ref> becoming \"one of the MCU's most beloved characters\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mentalfloss.com/article/586595/tom-hiddleston-loki-series-departure-from-mcu-films|title=Tom Hiddleston Says Disney+ Loki Series Is a 'New Departure' From the MCU Films|first=Jessica|last=Bowman|website=mentalfloss.com|date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> Hiddleston has received a number of nominations and awards for his performance of the character.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

In the films, Loki is known as the \"God of Mischief\", and is one of the most powerful of the [[Asgardians (comics)|Asgardians]], an alien civilization with long ties to Earth, who are therefore considered by some on Earth to be gods.\n\n{{As of|2019}}, the character is an important recurring figure of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. He has appeared in six films of the series, ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'', ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'', ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'', ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'', ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'', and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', and will appear in a stand-alone [[Disney+]] television series focused on the character. Loki's character has borrowed a number of characteristics and storylines from across the more than fifty-year history of the character in Marvel Comics. As in the comics, Loki has generally been a villain in the MCU, variously attempting to conquer Asgard or Earth, and having allied himself with more powerful villains to achieve his aims. He has particular antagonism for his adoptive brother [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]], and is known to variously ally with and then betray Thor and others, and to regularly return from apparent death. Later on in his development in the films, he becomes less of a [[supervillain]] and more of an [[antihero]].\n\n==Concept and creation==\nThe mythical figure, Loki, actually preceded Thor in making his first Marvel Comics appearance, depicted in the [[science fiction]]/[[fantasy]] [[anthology]] title [[Timely Comics]]' publication ''[[Venus (comic book)|Venus]]'' No. 6 (August 1949) as a member of the [[Olympians (Marvel Comics)|Olympian gods]] exiled to the [[Hades|Underworld]]. However, the current version of Loki made his first official Marvel appearance was in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' No. 85 (October 1962), where Loki was reintroduced as Thor's sworn enemy. The modern age Loki was introduced by brothers and co-writers [[Stan Lee]] and [[Larry Lieber]] and he was redesigned by [[Jack Kirby]]. As one of Thor's arch-nemeses, Loki frequently made appearances in Thor-related titles like ''Journey into Mystery'' and ''Thor'', as well as other [[Marvel Universe]] titles such as ''[[Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' and ''[[X-Men]]''.<ref>''X-Men and Alpha Flight'' No. 1 (December 1985)</ref> As well as brief appearances in the ''[[Spider-Man]]'' and ''[[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]'' comic series.\n\nLive-action film adaptations of character in the ''Thor'' comic books were proposed at various times, but did not come to fruition. In the mid-2000s, [[Kevin Feige]] realized that Marvel still owned the rights to the core members of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], which included Thor. Feige, a self-professed \"fanboy\", envisioned creating a shared universe just as creators Stan Lee and Jack Kirby had done with their comic books in the early 1960s.<ref name=\"BostonApril2012\">{{cite web|date=April 25, 2012 |last=Russo |first=Tom |title=SUPER GROUP |url=https://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2012/04/29/the_avengers_collects_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbustersuper_groupthe_avengers_assembles_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbuster/ |publisher=[[Boston.com]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6LK5iBg53?url=http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2012/04/29/the_avengers_collects_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbustersuper_groupthe_avengers_assembles_all_your_favorite_marvel_characters_in_one_handy_wannabe_blockbuster/?page=1 |archivedate=November 22, 2013 |url-status=live  }}</ref> In 2006, the film was announced as a Marvel Studios production.<ref name=\"Carle\">{{cite news|first=Chris |last=Carle |title=Comic-Con 2006: Marvel Announces Three |work=IGN |date=July 3, 2006 |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/720/720532p1.html |accessdate=August 10, 2008 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zxByL7iA?url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/720/720532p1.html |archivedate=July 5, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> In December 2007, Protosevich described his plans for it \"to be like a [[superhero]] [[origin story]], but not one about a human gaining super powers, but of a god realizing his true potential.

Odin uses magic to make Loki appear Asgardian, and raises him as a son alongside Odin's biological son, Thor. During his upbringing, Odin's wife Freya teaches Loki to use magic and illusion.\n\nHundreds of years later, Loki watches as Thor prepares to ascend to the throne of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]]. This is interrupted by frost giants attempting to retrieve an artifact captured by Odin in a war centuries before. Loki manipulates Thor into traveling to Jotunheim against Odin's order, to confront Frost Giant leader Laufey, accompanied by Loki and several of Thor's fellow warriors. A battle ensues until Odin intervenes to save the Asgardians, destroying the fragile truce between the two races. Loki discovers that he is Laufey's biological son, adopted by Odin after the war ended. After Odin exiles Thor to Earth, Loki confronts Odin about his parentage, and a weary Odin falls into the deep \"Odinsleep\" to recover his strength. Loki takes the throne in Odin's stead and offers Laufey the chance to kill Odin and retrieve the Casket. Sif and the Warriors Three, unhappy with Loki's rule, attempt to return Thor from exile, convincing [[Heimdall (comics)|Heimdall]], gatekeeper of the [[Bifr\u00f6st]]\u2014the means of traveling between worlds\u2014to allow them passage to Earth. Aware of their plan, Loki sends the [[Destroyer (Thor)|Destroyer]], a seemingly indestructible [[automaton]], to pursue them and kill Thor, but Thor regains his powers and defeats the Destroyer. Thor leaves with his fellow Asgardians to confront Loki.\n\nIn Asgard, Loki betrays and kills Laufey, revealing his true plan to use Laufey's attempt on Odin's life as an excuse to destroy Jotunheim with the Bifr\u00f6st Bridge, thus proving himself worthy to his adoptive father. Thor arrives and fights Loki before destroying the [[Bifr\u00f6st Bridge]] to stop Loki's plan, stranding himself in Asgard. Odin awakens and prevents the brothers from falling into the abyss created in the wake of the bridge's destruction, but Loki apparently commits suicide by allowing himself to fall when Odin rejects his pleas for approval.\n\nIn space, Loki encounters the Other, the leader of an extraterrestrial race known as the [[Chitauri]].

Later, [[Erik Selvig]] is taken to a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility, where Nick Fury opens a briefcase and asks him to study a mysterious cube, which [[Nick Fury]] says may hold untold power. Loki, invisible, prompts Selvig to agree, and he does.\n\n===Attacking Earth===\n{{see|The Avengers (2012 film)}}\nLoki attacks a remote [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] research facility, using his scepter to enslave the mind of [[Clint Barton (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Clint Barton]] and steals the Tesseract. In [[Stuttgart]], Barton steals [[iridium]] needed to stabilize the Tesseract's power while Loki causes a distraction, leading to a brief confrontation with Steve Rogers, Tony Stark, and Natasha Romanoff that ends with Loki's surrender. While Loki is being escorted to S.H.I.E.L.D., [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] arrives and frees him, hoping to convince him to abandon his plan and return to Asgard. After a confrontation with Stark and Rogers, Thor agrees to take Loki to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s flying aircraft carrier, the [[Helicarrier]]. Upon arrival, Loki is imprisoned while Banner and Stark attempt to locate the Tesseract.\n\nAgents possessed by Loki attack the Helicarrier, disabling one of its engines in flight and causing [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]] to transform into the Hulk. Thor attempts to stop the Hulk's rampage, and Loki kills Agent Coulson and ejects Thor from the airship as he escapes. Stark and Rogers realize that for Loki, simply defeating them will not be enough; he needs to overpower them publicly to validate himself as ruler of Earth. Loki uses the Tesseract, in conjunction with a device Selvig built, to open a wormhole above [[Stark Tower]] in [[New York City]] to the Chitauri fleet in space, launching his invasion. The Avengers arrive and rally in defense of the city. As the Chitauri are defeated, the Hulk attacks Loki and beats him into submission. Thor returns Loki and the Tesseract to Asgard.\n\n===Battle with the Dark Elves===\n{{see|Thor: The Dark World}}\n[[Elves (Marvel Comics)#Dark Elves|Dark Elves]] led by [[Malekith the Accursed|Malekith]] attack Asgard, searching for Jane Foster, whose body has been invaded by an unearthly force known as the Aether. Malekith and his monstrous lieutenant Kurse kill Loki's adoptive mother [[Frigga (comics)|Frigga]], who had taught Loki magic. Thor reluctantly frees Loki, who knows a secret portal to [[Svartalfheim]], home of the dark elves, in return for Thor's promise to take vengeance for their mother.\n\nIn Svartalfheim, Loki appears to betray Thor, in fact tricking Malekith into drawing the Aether out of Jane, but Thor's attempt to destroy the exposed substance fails. Malekith merges with the Aether and leaves in his ship as Loki appears to be fatally wounded saving Thor from Kurse, whom Loki was able to kill through trickery. Thor ultimately defeats Malekith in a battle in [[Greenwich]], and returns to Asgard to decline Odin's offer to take the throne, and tells Odin of Loki's sacrifice. After Thor leaves, it is shown that Loki has actually survived and taken Odin's place on the throne, disguised as Odin.\n\n===Destruction of Asgard and battle with Thanos===\n{{see|Thor: Ragnarok|Avengers: Infinity War|Avengers: Endgame}}\nSeveral years later, Loki continues to rule Asgard disguised as Odin, having kept the real Odin under a spell in a nursing home in New York City. Thor returns to Asgard and discovers this ruse. He takes Loki to New York, and with the help of [[Doctor Strange|Stephen Strange]], they find a dying Odin in Norway, who explains that his passing will allow his firstborn child, Hela, to escape from a prison she was sealed in long ago. She appears, destroying Mj\u00f6lnir, and forces the escaping Thor and Loki from the Bifr\u00f6st out into space.\n\nLoki lands on the planet Sakaar, and quickly ingratiates himself to the ruler of that world, the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]]. Thor later crash-lands on the planet, and is captured by the slave trader [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]], a former member of the ancient order of [[Valkyrior|Valkyries]] defeated by Hela. After convincing Valkyrie and Loki to help, they steal a ship with which to escape through a wormhole to Asgard \u2013 but not before Loki again attempts to betray his brother, causing Thor to leave Loki behind on Sakaar. In the midst of a battle with Hela's forces, Loki returns aboard a large vessel stolen from the Grandmaster, helping Asgard's citizens to escape the battle between Thor and Hela's forces, and proclaiming himself their savior. Loki helps defeat Hela by rushing to Odin's treasure room and placing the crown of Surtur in the eternal flame kept there, thus causing an enormous form of Surtur to appear and destroy Asgard, which is Hela's source of power. Thor, crowned king, decides to take his people to Earth despite Loki's concerns about how he will be received there, but they are intercepted by a large spacecraft carrying Thanos.\n\nThanos, wielding the Power Stone after an assault on Xandar, overpowers Thor and Hulk, and claims the Space Stone from the Tesseract, which Loki had stolen just before Asgard's destruction. In a last act of self-sacrifice, Loki pretends to swear allegiance to Thanos, only to attempt a futile attack, after which Thanos chokes Loki to death.\n\n===Alternative timeline===\n{{see|Loki (TV series)}}\nThanos eventually obtains all the Infinity Stones and snaps his fingers and destroys half the population of the universe. Five years later, the remaining Avengers figure out how to travel back in time to obtain the Infinity Stones before Thanos does to undo the snap, leading several of them to return to the Battle of New York. The plans of the time-travelling Avengers go awry, however, allowing the now-captured past version of Loki to get hold of the Space Stone and escape, forming a new timeline where Loki is again alive.\n\n==Reception==\nThe character of Loki \"has been a fan favorite ever since his central role in 2012's ''The Avengers''\",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/loki-tv-show-questions-answers-death-tesseract/|title=Loki TV Show Answers Tom Hiddleston's Death & Tesseract Questions|first=Kyle|last=Morris|publisher=[[ScreenRant]]|date=September 18, 2019}}</ref> becoming \"one of the MCU's most beloved characters\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mentalfloss.com/article/586595/tom-hiddleston-loki-series-departure-from-mcu-films|title=Tom Hiddleston Says Disney+ Loki Series Is a 'New Departure' From the MCU Films|first=Jessica|last=Bowman|website=mentalfloss.com|date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> Hiddleston has received a number of nominations and awards for his performance of the character.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The character also had two cameo appearances both in ''[[Spider-Man Homecoming]]'' and ''[[Spider-Man Far From Home]]''.\n\n==Character concept, creation, and characterization==\n\nThe character of Ant-Man was originally created by [[Stan Lee]], [[Larry Lieber]] and [[Jack Kirby]], first appearing in ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' #35 (September 1962). The persona was originally the brilliant scientist [[Hank Pym]]'s superhero alias after inventing a substance that can change size.

While in prison, his wife Maggie left him with their daughter, [[Cassandra Lang|Cassie]].\n\nUpon his release from prison, Lang moves in with his old cellmate, Luis. He visits Cassie unannounced, and is chastised by Maggie and her police-detective fianc\u00e9, Paxton, for not providing child support. Unable to hold down a job because of his criminal record, Lang agrees to join Luis' crew and commit a burglary. Following a tip, Lang breaks into a house and cracks its safe, but only finds an old motorcycle suit, which he later tries on, accidentally shrinking to the size of an insect. Terrified, he returns the suit to the house, but is arrested, and then broken out of jail by the homeowner, Hank Pym.\n\nPym reveals that he had previously operated as the superhero Ant-Man and had manipulated Lang through an unknowing Luis into stealing the suit as a test. Pym wants Lang to become the new Ant-Man to steal the Yellowjacket from Pym's former prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Darren Cross. Pym and his daughter, Hope Van Dyne, train Lang to fight and to control ants. Pym reveals that Hope's mother, Janet, known as the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], disappeared into a subatomic [[Features of the Marvel Universe#Extradimensional places|quantum realm]] while disabling a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] nuclear missile. Pym warns Lang that he could suffer a similar fate if he overrides his suit's regulator. Sent to steal a device from [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]' headquarters, Lang briefly fights [[Falcon (comics)|Sam Wilson]].\n\nLang, along with his crew and a swarm of flying ants, infiltrates Pym Technologies' headquarters as Cross hosts a ceremony at the building to unveil his perfected Yellowjacket suit. Lang and Van Dyne dispatch Hydra agents at the event before explosives detonate, imploding the building. Cross dons the Yellowjacket and takes Cassie hostage to lure Lang into a fight. Lang overrides the regulator and shrinks to subatomic size to penetrate Cross' suit and sabotage it to shrink uncontrollably, killing Cross. Lang disappears into the quantum realm but manages to reverse the effects and returns to the [[Macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] world. Out of gratitude for Lang's heroism, Paxton covers for Lang to keep him out of prison. Seeing that Lang survived and returned from the quantum realm, Pym wonders if his wife is alive as well. Later, Lang meets up with Luis, who tells him that Wilson is looking for him.\n\n===Assisting Steve Rogers===\nLang is recruited by Wilson to help [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]], who has gone rogue in the wake of the implementation of the Sokovia Accords. Lang and the rest of Rogers' team travel to [[Leipzig/Halle Airport]], where they are found by Tony Stark and Stark's team. During the battle between the teams, Lang becomes Giant-Man, using his suit to grow to enormous size, allowing Rogers and Bucky Barnes to escape while Lang and others allied with Rogers are captured. Lang and the others are sent to the Raft floating prison, until they are broken out by Rogers. He and Clint Barton negotiate deals with the U.S. government to turn themselves in, receiving a term of [[house arrest]] in exchange.\n\n===Returning to the role of Ant-Man===\nTwo years later, while Lang is on house arrest due to his involvement with the violation of the [[Registration Acts (comics)#Marvel Cinematic Universe|Sokovia Accords]],{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|As depicted in the 2016 film ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]''}} Pym and van Dyne briefly manage to open a tunnel to the [[Features of the Marvel Universe#Extradimensional places|quantum realm]], believing Janet van Dyne might be trapped there. When he had previously visited the quantum realm, Lang had unknowingly become [[Quantum entanglement|quantumly entangled]] with Janet, and now he receives an apparent message from her.\n\nWith only days left of house arrest, Lang contacts Pym about Janet despite the strained relationship they have due to Lang's actions with the Avengers. Hope and Pym kidnap Lang, leaving a decoy so as not to arouse suspicion from FBI agent [[Jimmy Woo]]. The trio work to build a stable quantum tunnel so they can take a vehicle to the quantum realm and retrieve her. They arrange to buy a part needed for the tunnel from black market dealer [[Sonny Burch]], who has realized the potential profit that can be earned from Pym's research and double-crosses them. Hope, in the Wasp outfit, fights off Burch and his men until she is attacked by a quantumly unstable masked woman. Lang tries to help fight off this \"[[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|ghost]]\", but the woman escapes with Pym's lab, which has been shrunk to the size of a suitcase.\n\nPym's estranged former partner [[Bill Foster (comics)|Bill Foster]] helps them locate the lab, where the ghost captures the trio and reveals herself to be Ava Starr. Her father [[Egghead (Marvel Comics)|Elihas]], another of Pym's former partners, died along with his wife during the experiment that caused Ava's unstable state. Foster reveals that Ava is dying and in constant pain as a result of her condition, and they plan to cure her using Janet's quantum energy. Believing that this will kill Janet, Pym refuses to help them and escapes with Hope, Lang, and the lab.\n\nOpening a stable version of the tunnel, Pym, Hope, and Lang are able to contact Janet, who gives them a precise location to find her but warns that they only have two hours before the unstable nature of the realm separates them for a century. Lang rushes home before Woo can see him violating his house arrest, but Pym and Hope are arrested by the FBI, allowing Ava to take the lab. Lang helps Pym and Hope escape custody, and they find the lab. Following a battle with both Ava and with Burch and his men, Pym and Janet return safely from the quantum realm, and Janet voluntarily gifts some of her energy to Ava to temporarily stabilize her.\n\nLang returns home once again, in time for a now suspicious Woo to release him at the end of his house arrest. In a [[Post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]], Pym, Lang, Hope, and Janet plan to harvest quantum energy to help Ava remain stable. While Lang is in the quantum realm doing this, Thanos attacks Earth in Wakanda, and uses the Infinity Gauntlet to snap his fingers and eliminate half of all life in the universe, including Pym, Hope, and Janet, leaving Lang trapped in the quantum realm.\n\n===The Time Heist===\nFive hours later, Lang escapes from the quantum realm when a rat activates the quantum tunnel equipment and releases him. He finds his daughter still alive, but five years older, and travels to the Avengers compound, where he explains to Romanoff and Rogers that he experienced only five hours while trapped. Theorizing the quantum realm's nature of existing outside reality could allow it to serve as a means of [[time travel]], the three ask Stark to help them retrieve the Stones from the past to reverse Thanos' actions in the present; Stark initially refuses to help, but later relents and works with Bruce Banner to successfully build a time machine. Banner, Lang, Rogers, and Stark travel to [[New York City]] in 2012, with Banner and Rogers retrieving the Time and Mind Stones respectively, but Stark and Lang's attempt to steal the Space Stone goes awry. Rogers and Stark send Lang back to the future while themselves traveling further into the past to obtain an earlier version of the Space Stone (along with extra Pym Particles, of which they only had a limited amount). Reuniting in the present, the Avengers fit the Stones into a Stark-created gauntlet, which Banner uses to resurrect all those whom Thanos disintegrated. Alerted to their actions when Nebula's cybernetic components synced up with the cybernetics of her past self when retrieving the Power Stone from 2014, past-Thanos and his warship arrive and attack the Avengers' compound. Thanos summons his army to devastate the Earth, planning to destroy and then rebuild the universe with the Stones, but an army of restored Avengers and allies arrive just as Lang again becomes Giant Man to rescue [[Hulk]], [[War Machine]], and [[Rocket Raccoon]] from the collapsing Avengers headquarters. Stark sacrifices his life to use the Infinity Gauntlet to disintegrate Thanos and his army, and Lang and his family later attend Stark's funeral.\n\n==Differences from the comics==\nIn the comics, Hank Pym's Ant-Man is a founding member of the Avengers, whereas in the MCU, Pym is initially distrustful of the Avengers, Stark in particular. No iteration of Ant-Man becomes involved with the Avengers in any capacity until Lang teams with Steve Rogers during the events of ''Captain America: Civil War'', and Lang does not become an official Avenger until the events of ''Avengers: Endgame''. Furthermore, in MCU continuity, Stark and Bruce Banner, rather than Pym, create Ultron.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Reception==\nThe consensus of [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reads, \"Led by a charming performance from Paul Rudd, ''Ant-Man'' offers Marvel thrills on an appropriately smaller scale \u2013 albeit not as smoothly as its most successful predecessors.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/antman/|title=Ant-Man (2015)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|accessdate=October 24, 2019}}</ref> [[Todd McCarthy]] of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' remarked, \"Although the story dynamics are fundamentally silly and the family stuff, with its parallel father-daughter melodrama, is elemental button-pushing, a good cast led by a winning Paul Rudd puts the nonsense over in reasonably disarming fashion.\"<ref name=\"THR_Review\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movie/ant-man-0/review/807018 |title='Ant-Man': Film Review |last=McCarthy |first=Todd |authorlink=Todd McCarthy |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=July 8, 2015 |accessdate=July 8, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708220740/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movie/ant-man-0/review/807018 |archivedate=July 8, 2015 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nFor ''Ant-Man and the Wasp'', the critical consensus on Rotten Tomatoes reads, \"A lighter, brighter superhero movie powered by the effortless charisma of Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly, ''Ant-Man and The Wasp'' offers a much-needed MCU palate cleanser.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ant_man_and_the_wasp |title=Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018) |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango Media]] |accessdate=October 24, 2019 }}</ref> Simon Abrams of [[RogerEbert.com]] felt that the film managed to juggle its many subplots while giving Rudd's Lang some decent character development.<ref name=\"RogerEbertReview\">{{Cite article |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/ant-man-and-the-wasp-2018 |title=Ant-Man and the Wasp |last=Abrams |first=Simon |website=[[RogerEbert.com]] |date=July 2, 2018 |access-date=July 6, 2018 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/70hBGMrKe?url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/ant-man-and-the-wasp-2018 |archive-date=July 5, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> [[Peter Travers]], writing for ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'', gave the film 3 out of 4 stars and praised Rudd and Lilly,<ref name=\"RollingStoneReview1\">{{Cite article |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/ant-man-and-the-wasp-movies-review-marvel-w521926 |title='Ant Man and the Wasp' Review: Tiny Heroes Turn New MCU Epic Into Giant Fun |first=Peter |last=Travers |author-link=Peter Travers |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=June 27, 2018 |access-date=June 27, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180627173900/https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/ant-man-and-the-wasp-movies-review-marvel-w521926 |archive-date=June 29, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> as did Manohla Dargis at ''[[The New York Times]]'', who praised Rudd, and felt Lilly found \"her groove\" in the film,<ref name=\"NewYorkTimesReview\">{{Cite article |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/04/movies/ant-man-and-the-wasp-review-marvel-paul-rudd.html |title=Review: \u2018Ant-Man and the Wasp\u2019 Save the World!

The persona was originally the brilliant scientist [[Hank Pym]]'s superhero alias after inventing a substance that can change size. Pym decided to become a superhero after his first wife was killed by corrupt secret police agents during the Cold War. Hank discovered a chemical substance, which he called Pym Particles, that would allow the user to alter his size.

While in prison, his wife Maggie left him with their daughter, [[Cassandra Lang|Cassie]].\n\nUpon his release from prison, Lang moves in with his old cellmate, Luis. He visits Cassie unannounced, and is chastised by Maggie and her police-detective fianc\u00e9, Paxton, for not providing child support. Unable to hold down a job because of his criminal record, Lang agrees to join Luis' crew and commit a burglary. Following a tip, Lang breaks into a house and cracks its safe, but only finds an old motorcycle suit, which he later tries on, accidentally shrinking to the size of an insect. Terrified, he returns the suit to the house, but is arrested, and then broken out of jail by the homeowner, Hank Pym.\n\nPym reveals that he had previously operated as the superhero Ant-Man and had manipulated Lang through an unknowing Luis into stealing the suit as a test. Pym wants Lang to become the new Ant-Man to steal the Yellowjacket from Pym's former prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Darren Cross. Pym and his daughter, Hope Van Dyne, train Lang to fight and to control ants. Pym reveals that Hope's mother, Janet, known as the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], disappeared into a subatomic [[Features of the Marvel Universe#Extradimensional places|quantum realm]] while disabling a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] nuclear missile. Pym warns Lang that he could suffer a similar fate if he overrides his suit's regulator. Sent to steal a device from [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]' headquarters, Lang briefly fights [[Falcon (comics)|Sam Wilson]].\n\nLang, along with his crew and a swarm of flying ants, infiltrates Pym Technologies' headquarters as Cross hosts a ceremony at the building to unveil his perfected Yellowjacket suit. Lang and Van Dyne dispatch Hydra agents at the event before explosives detonate, imploding the building. Cross dons the Yellowjacket and takes Cassie hostage to lure Lang into a fight. Lang overrides the regulator and shrinks to subatomic size to penetrate Cross' suit and sabotage it to shrink uncontrollably, killing Cross. Lang disappears into the quantum realm but manages to reverse the effects and returns to the [[Macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] world. Out of gratitude for Lang's heroism, Paxton covers for Lang to keep him out of prison. Seeing that Lang survived and returned from the quantum realm, Pym wonders if his wife is alive as well. Later, Lang meets up with Luis, who tells him that Wilson is looking for him.\n\n===Assisting Steve Rogers===\nLang is recruited by Wilson to help [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]], who has gone rogue in the wake of the implementation of the Sokovia Accords. Lang and the rest of Rogers' team travel to [[Leipzig/Halle Airport]], where they are found by Tony Stark and Stark's team. During the battle between the teams, Lang becomes Giant-Man, using his suit to grow to enormous size, allowing Rogers and Bucky Barnes to escape while Lang and others allied with Rogers are captured. Lang and the others are sent to the Raft floating prison, until they are broken out by Rogers. He and Clint Barton negotiate deals with the U.S. government to turn themselves in, receiving a term of [[house arrest]] in exchange.\n\n===Returning to the role of Ant-Man===\nTwo years later, while Lang is on house arrest due to his involvement with the violation of the [[Registration Acts (comics)#Marvel Cinematic Universe|Sokovia Accords]],{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|As depicted in the 2016 film ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]''}} Pym and van Dyne briefly manage to open a tunnel to the [[Features of the Marvel Universe#Extradimensional places|quantum realm]], believing Janet van Dyne might be trapped there. When he had previously visited the quantum realm, Lang had unknowingly become [[Quantum entanglement|quantumly entangled]] with Janet, and now he receives an apparent message from her.\n\nWith only days left of house arrest, Lang contacts Pym about Janet despite the strained relationship they have due to Lang's actions with the Avengers. Hope and Pym kidnap Lang, leaving a decoy so as not to arouse suspicion from FBI agent [[Jimmy Woo]]. The trio work to build a stable quantum tunnel so they can take a vehicle to the quantum realm and retrieve her. They arrange to buy a part needed for the tunnel from black market dealer [[Sonny Burch]], who has realized the potential profit that can be earned from Pym's research and double-crosses them. Hope, in the Wasp outfit, fights off Burch and his men until she is attacked by a quantumly unstable masked woman. Lang tries to help fight off this \"[[Ghost (Marvel Comics)|ghost]]\", but the woman escapes with Pym's lab, which has been shrunk to the size of a suitcase.\n\nPym's estranged former partner [[Bill Foster (comics)|Bill Foster]] helps them locate the lab, where the ghost captures the trio and reveals herself to be Ava Starr. Her father [[Egghead (Marvel Comics)|Elihas]], another of Pym's former partners, died along with his wife during the experiment that caused Ava's unstable state. Foster reveals that Ava is dying and in constant pain as a result of her condition, and they plan to cure her using Janet's quantum energy. Believing that this will kill Janet, Pym refuses to help them and escapes with Hope, Lang, and the lab.\n\nOpening a stable version of the tunnel, Pym, Hope, and Lang are able to contact Janet, who gives them a precise location to find her but warns that they only have two hours before the unstable nature of the realm separates them for a century. Lang rushes home before Woo can see him violating his house arrest, but Pym and Hope are arrested by the FBI, allowing Ava to take the lab. Lang helps Pym and Hope escape custody, and they find the lab. Following a battle with both Ava and with Burch and his men, Pym and Janet return safely from the quantum realm, and Janet voluntarily gifts some of her energy to Ava to temporarily stabilize her.\n\nLang returns home once again, in time for a now suspicious Woo to release him at the end of his house arrest. In a [[Post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]], Pym, Lang, Hope, and Janet plan to harvest quantum energy to help Ava remain stable. While Lang is in the quantum realm doing this, Thanos attacks Earth in Wakanda, and uses the Infinity Gauntlet to snap his fingers and eliminate half of all life in the universe, including Pym, Hope, and Janet, leaving Lang trapped in the quantum realm.\n\n===The Time Heist===\nFive hours later, Lang escapes from the quantum realm when a rat activates the quantum tunnel equipment and releases him. He finds his daughter still alive, but five years older, and travels to the Avengers compound, where he explains to Romanoff and Rogers that he experienced only five hours while trapped. Theorizing the quantum realm's nature of existing outside reality could allow it to serve as a means of [[time travel]], the three ask Stark to help them retrieve the Stones from the past to reverse Thanos' actions in the present; Stark initially refuses to help, but later relents and works with Bruce Banner to successfully build a time machine. Banner, Lang, Rogers, and Stark travel to [[New York City]] in 2012, with Banner and Rogers retrieving the Time and Mind Stones respectively, but Stark and Lang's attempt to steal the Space Stone goes awry. Rogers and Stark send Lang back to the future while themselves traveling further into the past to obtain an earlier version of the Space Stone (along with extra Pym Particles, of which they only had a limited amount). Reuniting in the present, the Avengers fit the Stones into a Stark-created gauntlet, which Banner uses to resurrect all those whom Thanos disintegrated. Alerted to their actions when Nebula's cybernetic components synced up with the cybernetics of her past self when retrieving the Power Stone from 2014, past-Thanos and his warship arrive and attack the Avengers' compound. Thanos summons his army to devastate the Earth, planning to destroy and then rebuild the universe with the Stones, but an army of restored Avengers and allies arrive just as Lang again becomes Giant Man to rescue [[Hulk]], [[War Machine]], and [[Rocket Raccoon]] from the collapsing Avengers headquarters. Stark sacrifices his life to use the Infinity Gauntlet to disintegrate Thanos and his army, and Lang and his family later attend Stark's funeral.\n\n==Differences from the comics==\nIn the comics, Hank Pym's Ant-Man is a founding member of the Avengers, whereas in the MCU, Pym is initially distrustful of the Avengers, Stark in particular. No iteration of Ant-Man becomes involved with the Avengers in any capacity until Lang teams with Steve Rogers during the events of ''Captain America: Civil War'', and Lang does not become an official Avenger until the events of ''Avengers: Endgame''. Furthermore, in MCU continuity, Stark and Bruce Banner, rather than Pym, create Ultron.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Reception==\nThe consensus of [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reads, \"Led by a charming performance from Paul Rudd, ''Ant-Man'' offers Marvel thrills on an appropriately smaller scale \u2013 albeit not as smoothly as its most successful predecessors.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/antman/|title=Ant-Man (2015)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|accessdate=October 24, 2019}}</ref> [[Todd McCarthy]] of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' remarked, \"Although the story dynamics are fundamentally silly and the family stuff, with its parallel father-daughter melodrama, is elemental button-pushing, a good cast led by a winning Paul Rudd puts the nonsense over in reasonably disarming fashion.\"<ref name=\"THR_Review\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movie/ant-man-0/review/807018 |title='Ant-Man': Film Review |last=McCarthy |first=Todd |authorlink=Todd McCarthy |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=July 8, 2015 |accessdate=July 8, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708220740/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movie/ant-man-0/review/807018 |archivedate=July 8, 2015 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nFor ''Ant-Man and the Wasp'', the critical consensus on Rotten Tomatoes reads, \"A lighter, brighter superhero movie powered by the effortless charisma of Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly, ''Ant-Man and The Wasp'' offers a much-needed MCU palate cleanser.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ant_man_and_the_wasp |title=Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018) |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango Media]] |accessdate=October 24, 2019 }}</ref> Simon Abrams of [[RogerEbert.com]] felt that the film managed to juggle its many subplots while giving Rudd's Lang some decent character development.<ref name=\"RogerEbertReview\">{{Cite article |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/ant-man-and-the-wasp-2018 |title=Ant-Man and the Wasp |last=Abrams |first=Simon |website=[[RogerEbert.com]] |date=July 2, 2018 |access-date=July 6, 2018 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/70hBGMrKe?url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/ant-man-and-the-wasp-2018 |archive-date=July 5, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> [[Peter Travers]], writing for ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'', gave the film 3 out of 4 stars and praised Rudd and Lilly,<ref name=\"RollingStoneReview1\">{{Cite article |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/ant-man-and-the-wasp-movies-review-marvel-w521926 |title='Ant Man and the Wasp' Review: Tiny Heroes Turn New MCU Epic Into Giant Fun |first=Peter |last=Travers |author-link=Peter Travers |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=June 27, 2018 |access-date=June 27, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180627173900/https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/ant-man-and-the-wasp-movies-review-marvel-w521926 |archive-date=June 29, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> as did Manohla Dargis at ''[[The New York Times]]'', who praised Rudd, and felt Lilly found \"her groove\" in the film,<ref name=\"NewYorkTimesReview\">{{Cite article |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/04/movies/ant-man-and-the-wasp-review-marvel-paul-rudd.html |title=Review: \u2018Ant-Man and the Wasp\u2019 Save the World!

There were also exemptions, [[privilege (legal ethics)|privileges]], and special charters granted by the kings or other feudal lords. During the Revolution, the last vestiges of [[feudalism]] were abolished.\n\nSpecifically, as to civil law, the many different bodies of law used in different parts of France were to be replaced by a single legal code. The [[Constituent Assembly]], on 5 October 1790, voted for a codification of the laws of France, the [[French Constitution of 1791|Constitution of 1791]] promised one, and the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] adopted a unanimous resolution on 4 September 1791, providing that \u201cthere shall be a code of civil laws common for the entire realm.\u201d<ref>Constitution of 3 September 1791, 1.11: \u201c''Il sera fait un Code de lois civiles communes \u00e0 tout le Royauame''\u201d.</ref> However, it was the [[National Convention]] in 1793 which established a special commission headed by [[Jean-Jacques R\u00e9gis de Cambac\u00e9r\u00e8s]] to oversee the drafting process. His drafts of 1793 (for which he had been given a one-month deadline), 1794, and 1796 were all rejected by a National Convention and [[French Directory|Directory]] more concerned with the turmoil resulting from the various wars and strife with other European powers. The first contained 719 articles and was very revolutionary, but was rejected for being too technical and criticized for not being radical or philosophical enough. The second, with only 297 articles, was rejected for being too brief and was criticized for being a mere manual of morals. The third, expanded to 1,104 articles, was presented under the Directory, a conservative regime, but never even came up for discussion.\n\nAnother commission, established in 1799, presented that December a fourth scheme drafted in part by [[Jean-Ignace Jacqueminot]] (1754-1813). Jacqueminot's draft, the so-called ''loi Jacqueminot'', dealt almost exclusively with persons<ref>Eric Descheemaeker, ''The Division of Wrongs: A Historical Comparative Study'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009), 128.</ref> and emphasized the need to reform the Revolutionary divorce laws, to strengthen parental authority and increase the testator's freedom to dispose of the free portion of his estate.<ref>Tom Holmberg, \u201cThe Civil Code: an Overview\u201d, ''The Napoleon Series'', September 2002, [online] <https://www.napoleon-series.org/research/government/code/c_code2.html>.</ref> It was, of course, rejected.\n\n===Napoleonic reforms===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}\n\nNapoleon set out to reform the French legal system in accordance with the ideas of the [[French Revolution]], because the old feudal and royal laws seemed confusing and contradictory. After multiple rejected drafts by other commissions, a fresh start was made after Napoleon came to power in 1799. A commission of four eminent jurists was appointed in 1800, including [[Louis-Joseph Faure|Louis-Joseph Faur\u00e9]] and chaired by Cambac\u00e9r\u00e8s (now [[Second Consul]]), and sometimes by the [[First Consul]], Napoleon himself. The Code was complete by 1801, after intensive scrutiny by the [[Council of State (France)|Council of State]], but was not published until 21 March 1804. It was promulgated as the \"Civil Code of the French\" (''Code civil des Fran\u00e7ais''), but was renamed \"the Napoleonic Code\" (''Code Napol\u00e9on'') from 1807 to 1815, and once again after the [[Second French Empire]].\n\nThe process developed mainly out of the various customs, but was inspired by Justinian's sixth-century codification of [[Roman law]], the ''[[Corpus Iuris Civilis]]'' and, within that, Justinian's Code (''Codex''). The Napoleonic Code, however, differed from Justinian's in important ways: it incorporated all kinds of earlier rules, not only legislation; it was not a collection of edited extracts, but a comprehensive rewrite; its structure was much more rational; it had no religious content, and it was written in the vernacular.\n\nThe development of the Napoleonic Code was a fundamental change in the nature of the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system, making laws clearer and more accessible. It also superseded the former conflict between royal legislative power and, particularly in the final years before the Revolution, protests by judges representing views and privileges of the social classes to which they belonged. Such conflict led the Revolutionaries to take a negative view of judges making law.\n\nThis is reflected in the Napoleonic Code provision prohibiting judges from deciding a case by way of introducing a general rule (Article 5), since the creation of general rules is an exercise of legislative and not of judicial power. In theory, there is thus no [[case law]] in France. However, the courts still had to fill in the gaps in the laws and regulations and, indeed, were prohibited from refusing to do so (Article 4). Moreover, both the code and legislation have required judicial interpretation. Thus a vast body of case law has come into existence. There is no rule of ''[[stare decisis]]'' (binding precedent) in French law, but decisions by important courts have become more or less equivalent to case law (see [[jurisprudence constante]]).\n\n==Contents of the Napoleonic Code==\nThe preliminary article of the Code established certain important provisions regarding the [[rule of law]]. Laws could be applied only if they had been duly promulgated, and then only if they had been published officially (including provisions for publishing delays, given the means of communication available at the time). Thus, no secret laws were authorized. It prohibited ''[[ex post facto]]'' laws (i.e. laws that apply to events that occurred before their introduction). The code also prohibited judges from refusing justice on grounds of insufficiency of the law, thereby encouraging them to interpret the law. On the other hand, it prohibited judges from passing general judgements of a legislative value (see above).\n\nWith regard to family, the Code established the supremacy of the man over the wife and children, which was the general legal situation in Europe at the time. Napoleon also had a severe case.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://go.galegroup.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CCX3446900340&v=2.1&u=lln_alsu&it=r&p=GVRL&sw=w&asid=c08b35013aa5b91235f47c753ac4e5e6|title = Gender|date = 2006|access-date = 17 Feb 2016|website = Gale Virtual Reference Library|publisher = Charles Scribner's Sons|last = Smith|first = Bonnie}}</ref> A woman was given fewer rights than a minor.

The new penal code did not mention [[blasphemy]], [[heresy]], [[sacrilege]], [[witchcraft]], [[incest]] or [[homosexuality]], which led to these former offences being swiftly decriminalized. In 1810, a [[French Penal Code of 1810|new criminal code]] was issued under Napoleon. As with the [[French Penal Code of 1791|Penal Code of 1791]], it did not contain provisions for religious crimes, incest or homosexuality.\n\n===Code of civil procedure===\nAs the entire legal system was being overhauled, the code of civil procedure was adopted in 1806. This had to do with the legal system, specifically how judges were corresponding over different regions of France.\n\n===Commercial code===\nThe commercial code (''code de commerce'') was adopted in 1807.<ref>[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/rechCodeArticle.do?reprise=true&page=1 Code de commerce]  Retrieved 2011-12-30</ref>\nThe kernel of the commercial code is the [http://www.napoleon-series.org/research/government/code/book3/c_title03.html BOOK III], \"Of The Different Modes Of Acquiring Property\", of the Napoleonic Code. It is a norm about the [[Transaction cost|contracts and transactions]].\n\n===Code of criminal instruction===\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2011}}\nIn 1808, a code of criminal instruction (''code d'instruction criminelle'') was published. This code laid out [[criminal procedure]]. The ''[[parlement]]'' system, from before the Revolution, had been guilty of much abuse, while the criminal courts established by the Revolution were a complex and ineffective system, subject to many local pressures. The genesis of this code resulted in much debate. The resulting code is the basis of the modern so-called \"[[inquisitorial system]]\" of criminal courts, used in France and many [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries, though significantly changed since Bonaparte's day (especially with regard to the expansion of the rights of the defendant).\n\nThe French Revolution's [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] declared that suspects were presumed to be innocent until they had been declared guilty by a [[court]]. A concern of Bonaparte's was the possibility of arbitrary arrest, or excessive [[Detention of suspects|remand]] (imprisonment prior to a trial). Bonaparte remarked that care should be taken to preserve personal freedoms, especially when the case was before the Imperial Court: \"these courts would have a great strength, they should be prohibited from abusing this situation against weak citizens without connections.\" However, remand still was the usual procedure for defendants suspected of serious crimes such as [[murder]].\n\nThe possibility of lengthy remand periods was one reason why the Napoleonic Code was criticized for its ''[[de facto]]'' [[presumption of innocence|presumption of guilt]], particularly in [[common law]] countries. Another reason was the combination of magistrate and prosecutor in one position.<ref>{{cite news|title=French Criminal Procedure|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1895/04/14/102454136.pdf|accessdate=14 June 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=14 April 1895}}</ref> However, the legal proceedings did not have ''[[de jure]]'' presumption of guilt; for instance, the juror's oath explicitly required that the jury not betray the interests of the defendants and not ignore the means of defense.\n\nThe rules governing court proceedings, by today's standards, gave significant power to the prosecution; however, criminal justice in European countries in those days tended to side with repression. For instance, it was only in 1836 that prisoners charged with a [[felony]] were given a formal [[right to counsel]], in [[Right to counsel#In the United Kingdom|England]]. In comparison, article 294 of the Napoleonic Code of Criminal Procedure allowed the defendant to have a [[lawyer]] before the Court of Assizes (judging felonies), and mandated the court to appoint a lawyer for the defendant if the defendant did not have one (failure to do so rendered the proceedings null).\n\nWhether or not the [[Cour d'assises]], whose task was to judge severe crimes, were to operate with a [[jury]] was a topic of considerable controversy. Bonaparte supported jury trials (or petit jury), and they were finally adopted. On the other hand, Bonaparte was opposed to the [[indictment]] jury (\"[[grand jury]]\" of [[common law]] countries), and preferred to give this task to the criminal division of the [[Court of Appeal]]s. Some special courts were created to judge of criminals who could [[intimidate]] the jury.\n\nBonaparte also insisted that the courts judging [[Private law|civil]] and [[crime|criminal]] cases should be the same, if only to give them more prestige.\n\n==The French codes in the 21st century==\nThe French codes, now more than 60 in number,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/initRechCodeArticle.do|title=Recherche simple dans les codes en vigueur - Legifrance|work=legifrance.gouv.fr}}</ref> are frequently amended, as well as [[Judicial review|judicially re-interpreted]].

In the German regions on the west bank of the Rhine ([[Palatinate region|Rhenish Palatinate]] and [[Prussia]]n [[Rhine Province]]), the former [[Duchy of Berg]] and the [[Grand Duchy of Baden]], the Napoleonic Code was in use until the introduction of the [[B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch]] in 1900 as the first common civil code for the entire [[German Empire]].<ref name=\"Arvind TT; Stirton L 2010 1\u201329\">{{cite journal |author=Arvind TT; Stirton L |title=Explaining the Reception of the Code Napoleon in Germany: a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis |journal=Legal Studies |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=1\u201329 |date=March 2010 |doi=10.1111/j.1748-121X.2009.00150.x |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/123270568/abstract|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130105071047/http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/123270568/abstract|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-01-05}}</ref>\n\nA number of factors have been shown by Arvind and Stirton to have had a determinative role in the decision by the German states to receive the Code, including territorial concerns, Napoleonic control and influence, the strength of central state institutions, a feudal economy and society, rule by [[Liberalism|liberal]] ([[enlightened despotism|enlightened despotic]]) rulers, [[nativism (politics)|nativism]] (local patriotism) among the governing elites, and popular [[anti-French sentiment]].<ref name=\"Arvind TT; Stirton L 2010 1\u201329\"/>\n\nA civil code with strong Napoleonic influences was also adopted in 1864 in [[Romania]], and remained in force until 2011.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://anndrei.ro/noul-cod-civil-promoveaza-medierea/ | title=Noul Cod civil promoveaz\u0103 medierea | date=2013-05-05 | accessdate=2013-05-31}}</ref>  The Code was also adopted in Egypt as part of the system of [[The Mixed Courts of Egypt|mixed courts]] introduced in [[Egypt]] after the fall of [[Khedive Ismail]].  The Code was translated into Arabic from the French by [[Youssef Wahba]] Pasha between 1881 and 1883. Other codes with some influence in their own right were the [[Swiss Civil Code|Swiss]], [[B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch|German]], and [[Allgemeines b\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch|Austrian]] codes, but even therein some influence of the French code can be felt, as the Napoleonic Code is considered the first successful codification.\n\nThus, the civil law systems of the countries of modern continental Europe, with the exception of [[Russia]] and the [[Scandinavia|Scandinavian countries]] have, to different degrees, been influenced by the Napoleonic Code. The legal systems of the [[United Kingdom]] other than [[Scotland]], as well as [[Ireland]] and the Commonwealth, are derived from [[English common law]] rather than from Roman roots. [[Scots law]], though also a civil law system, is uncodified; it was strongly influenced by [[Roman-Dutch law|Roman-Dutch]] legal thought, and after the [[Act of Union 1707]], by English law.\n\nThe term \"Napoleonic Code\" is also used to refer to legal codes of other [[jurisdictions]] that are influenced by the ''French Code Napol\u00e9on'', especially the ''[[Civil Code of Lower Canada]]'' (replaced in 1994 by the ''[[Civil Code of Quebec]]''), mainly derived from the ''[[Coutume de Paris]]'', which the British continued to use in Canada following the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763. Most of the laws in [[Latin American]] countries are also heavily based on the Napoleonic Code, e.g. the [[Civil Code (Chile)|Chilean Civil Code]] and the Puerto Rican Civil Code.<ref>{{Citation    |year= 1950 |last=Rabel |first=Ernst   |contribution= Private Laws of Western Civilization: Part II.

There were also exemptions, [[privilege (legal ethics)|privileges]], and special charters granted by the kings or other feudal lords.

The first contained 719 articles and was very revolutionary, but was rejected for being too technical and criticized for not being radical or philosophical enough. The second, with only 297 articles, was rejected for being too brief and was criticized for being a mere manual of morals. The third, expanded to 1,104 articles, was presented under the Directory, a conservative regime, but never even came up for discussion.\n\nAnother commission, established in 1799, presented that December a fourth scheme drafted in part by [[Jean-Ignace Jacqueminot]] (1754-1813). Jacqueminot's draft, the so-called ''loi Jacqueminot'', dealt almost exclusively with persons<ref>Eric Descheemaeker, ''The Division of Wrongs: A Historical Comparative Study'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009), 128.</ref> and emphasized the need to reform the Revolutionary divorce laws, to strengthen parental authority and increase the testator's freedom to dispose of the free portion of his estate.<ref>Tom Holmberg, \u201cThe Civil Code: an Overview\u201d, ''The Napoleon Series'', September 2002, [online] <https://www.napoleon-series.org/research/government/code/c_code2.html>.</ref> It was, of course, rejected.\n\n===Napoleonic reforms===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2011}}\n\nNapoleon set out to reform the French legal system in accordance with the ideas of the [[French Revolution]], because the old feudal and royal laws seemed confusing and contradictory. After multiple rejected drafts by other commissions, a fresh start was made after Napoleon came to power in 1799. A commission of four eminent jurists was appointed in 1800, including [[Louis-Joseph Faure|Louis-Joseph Faur\u00e9]] and chaired by Cambac\u00e9r\u00e8s (now [[Second Consul]]), and sometimes by the [[First Consul]], Napoleon himself. The Code was complete by 1801, after intensive scrutiny by the [[Council of State (France)|Council of State]], but was not published until 21 March 1804. It was promulgated as the \"Civil Code of the French\" (''Code civil des Fran\u00e7ais''), but was renamed \"the Napoleonic Code\" (''Code Napol\u00e9on'') from 1807 to 1815, and once again after the [[Second French Empire]].\n\nThe process developed mainly out of the various customs, but was inspired by Justinian's sixth-century codification of [[Roman law]], the ''[[Corpus Iuris Civilis]]'' and, within that, Justinian's Code (''Codex''). The Napoleonic Code, however, differed from Justinian's in important ways: it incorporated all kinds of earlier rules, not only legislation; it was not a collection of edited extracts, but a comprehensive rewrite; its structure was much more rational; it had no religious content, and it was written in the vernacular.\n\nThe development of the Napoleonic Code was a fundamental change in the nature of the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system, making laws clearer and more accessible. It also superseded the former conflict between royal legislative power and, particularly in the final years before the Revolution, protests by judges representing views and privileges of the social classes to which they belonged. Such conflict led the Revolutionaries to take a negative view of judges making law.\n\nThis is reflected in the Napoleonic Code provision prohibiting judges from deciding a case by way of introducing a general rule (Article 5), since the creation of general rules is an exercise of legislative and not of judicial power. In theory, there is thus no [[case law]] in France. However, the courts still had to fill in the gaps in the laws and regulations and, indeed, were prohibited from refusing to do so (Article 4). Moreover, both the code and legislation have required judicial interpretation. Thus a vast body of case law has come into existence. There is no rule of ''[[stare decisis]]'' (binding precedent) in French law, but decisions by important courts have become more or less equivalent to case law (see [[jurisprudence constante]]).\n\n==Contents of the Napoleonic Code==\nThe preliminary article of the Code established certain important provisions regarding the [[rule of law]]. Laws could be applied only if they had been duly promulgated, and then only if they had been published officially (including provisions for publishing delays, given the means of communication available at the time). Thus, no secret laws were authorized. It prohibited ''[[ex post facto]]'' laws (i.e. laws that apply to events that occurred before their introduction). The code also prohibited judges from refusing justice on grounds of insufficiency of the law, thereby encouraging them to interpret the law. On the other hand, it prohibited judges from passing general judgments of a legislative value (see above).\n\nWith regard to family, the Code established the supremacy of the man over the wife and children, which was the general legal situation in Europe at the time. Napoleon also had a severe case.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://go.galegroup.com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CCX3446900340&v=2.1&u=lln_alsu&it=r&p=GVRL&sw=w&asid=c08b35013aa5b91235f47c753ac4e5e6|title = Gender|date = 2006|access-date = 17 Feb 2016|website = Gale Virtual Reference Library|publisher = Charles Scribner's Sons|last = Smith|first = Bonnie}}</ref> A woman was given fewer rights than a minor.

The new penal code did not mention [[blasphemy]], [[heresy]], [[sacrilege]], [[witchcraft]], [[incest]] or [[homosexuality]], which led to these former offences being swiftly decriminalized. In 1810, a [[French Penal Code of 1810|new criminal code]] was issued under Napoleon. As with the [[French Penal Code of 1791|Penal Code of 1791]], it did not contain provisions for religious crimes, incest or homosexuality.\n\n===Code of civil procedure===\nAs the entire legal system was being overhauled, the code of civil procedure was adopted in 1806. This had to do with the legal system, specifically how judges were corresponding over different regions of France.\n\n===Commercial code===\nThe commercial code (''code de commerce'') was adopted in 1807.<ref>[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/rechCodeArticle.do?reprise=true&page=1 Code de commerce]  Retrieved 2011-12-30</ref>\nThe kernel of the commercial code is the [http://www.napoleon-series.org/research/government/code/book3/c_title03.html BOOK III], \"Of The Different Modes Of Acquiring Property\", of the Napoleonic Code. It is a norm about the [[Transaction cost|contracts and transactions]].\n\n===Code of criminal instruction===\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2011}}\nIn 1808, a code of criminal instruction (''code d'instruction criminelle'') was published. This code laid out [[criminal procedure]]. The ''[[parlement]]'' system, from before the Revolution, had been guilty of much abuse, while the criminal courts established by the Revolution were a complex and ineffective system, subject to many local pressures. The genesis of this code resulted in much debate. The resulting code is the basis of the modern so-called \"[[inquisitorial system]]\" of criminal courts, used in France and many [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] countries, though significantly changed since Bonaparte's day (especially with regard to the expansion of the rights of the defendant).\n\nThe French Revolution's [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] declared that suspects were presumed to be innocent until they had been declared guilty by a [[court]]. A concern of Bonaparte's was the possibility of arbitrary arrest, or excessive [[Detention of suspects|remand]] (imprisonment prior to a trial). Bonaparte remarked that care should be taken to preserve personal freedoms, especially when the case was before the Imperial Court: \"these courts would have a great strength, they should be prohibited from abusing this situation against weak citizens without connections.\" However, remand still was the usual procedure for defendants suspected of serious crimes such as [[murder]].\n\nThe possibility of lengthy remand periods was one reason why the Napoleonic Code was criticized for its ''[[de facto]]'' [[presumption of innocence|presumption of guilt]], particularly in [[common law]] countries. Another reason was the combination of magistrate and prosecutor in one position.<ref>{{cite news|title=French Criminal Procedure|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1895/04/14/102454136.pdf|accessdate=14 June 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=14 April 1895}}</ref> However, the legal proceedings did not have ''[[de jure]]'' presumption of guilt; for instance, the juror's oath explicitly required that the jury not betray the interests of the defendants and not ignore the means of defense.\n\nThe rules governing court proceedings, by today's standards, gave significant power to the prosecution; however, criminal justice in European countries in those days tended to side with repression. For instance, it was only in 1836 that prisoners charged with a [[felony]] were given a formal [[right to counsel]], in [[Right to counsel#In the United Kingdom|England]]. In comparison, article 294 of the Napoleonic Code of Criminal Procedure allowed the defendant to have a [[lawyer]] before the Court of Assizes (judging felonies), and mandated the court to appoint a lawyer for the defendant if the defendant did not have one (failure to do so rendered the proceedings null).\n\nWhether or not the [[Cour d'assises]], whose task was to judge severe crimes, were to operate with a [[jury]] was a topic of considerable controversy. Bonaparte supported jury trials (or petit jury), and they were finally adopted. On the other hand, Bonaparte was opposed to the [[indictment]] jury (\"[[grand jury]]\" of [[common law]] countries), and preferred to give this task to the criminal division of the [[Court of Appeal]]s. Some special courts were created to judge of criminals who could [[intimidate]] the jury.\n\nBonaparte also insisted that the courts judging [[Private law|civil]] and [[crime|criminal]] cases should be the same, if only to give them more prestige.\n\n==The French codes in the 21st century==\nThe French codes, now more than 60 in number,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/initRechCodeArticle.do|title=Recherche simple dans les codes en vigueur - Legifrance|work=legifrance.gouv.fr}}</ref> are frequently amended, as well as [[Judicial review|judicially re-interpreted]]. Therefore, for over a century all of the codes in force have been documented in the annually revised editions published by [[Dalloz]] (Paris).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boutique.dalloz.fr|title=Code civil, Code du travail, tous les livres de droit des Editions Dalloz|work=dalloz.fr}}</ref> These editions consist of thorough [[annotation]]s, with references to other codes, relevant [[statute]]s, judicial decisions (even if unpublished), and international instruments.

Additional material, including scholarly articles, is added in the larger \"expert (''expert'')\" version and the still larger \"mega (''m\u00e9ga'')\" version, both of which are available in print and on searchable [[CD-ROM]].

It was adopted in many countries occupied by the French during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and thus formed the basis of the private law systems of [[Italy]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[Spain]], [[Portugal]] (and their former colonies), and [[Poland]] (1808\u20131946). In the German regions on the west bank of the Rhine ([[Palatinate region|Rhenish Palatinate]] and [[Prussia]]n [[Rhine Province]]), the former [[Duchy of Berg]] and the [[Grand Duchy of Baden]], the Napoleonic Code was in use until the introduction of the [[B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch]] in 1900 as the first common civil code for the entire [[German Empire]].<ref name=\"Arvind TT; Stirton L 2010 1\u201329\">{{cite journal |author=Arvind TT; Stirton L |title=Explaining the Reception of the Code Napoleon in Germany: a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis |journal=Legal Studies |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=1\u201329 |date=March 2010 |doi=10.1111/j.1748-121X.2009.00150.x |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/123270568/abstract|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130105071047/http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/123270568/abstract|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-01-05}}</ref>\n\nA number of factors have been shown by Arvind and Stirton to have had a determinative role in the decision by the German states to receive the Code, including territorial concerns, Napoleonic control and influence, the strength of central state institutions, a feudal economy and society, rule by [[Liberalism|liberal]] ([[enlightened despotism|enlightened despotic]]) rulers, [[nativism (politics)|nativism]] (local patriotism) among the governing elites, and popular [[anti-French sentiment]].<ref name=\"Arvind TT; Stirton L 2010 1\u201329\"/>\n\nA civil code with strong Napoleonic influences was also adopted in 1864 in [[Romania]], and remained in force until 2011.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://anndrei.ro/noul-cod-civil-promoveaza-medierea/ | title=Noul Cod civil promoveaz\u0103 medierea | date=2013-05-05 | accessdate=2013-05-31}}</ref>  The Code was also adopted in Egypt as part of the system of [[The Mixed Courts of Egypt|mixed courts]] introduced in [[Egypt]] after the fall of [[Khedive Ismail]].  The Code was translated into Arabic from the French by [[Youssef Wahba]] Pasha between 1881 and 1883. Other codes with some influence in their own right were the [[Swiss Civil Code|Swiss]], [[B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch|German]], and [[Allgemeines b\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch|Austrian]] codes, but even therein some influence of the French code can be felt, as the Napoleonic Code is considered the first successful codification.\n\nThus, the civil law systems of the countries of modern continental Europe, with the exception of [[Russia]] and the [[Scandinavia|Scandinavian countries]] have, to different degrees, been influenced by the Napoleonic Code. The legal systems of the [[United Kingdom]] other than [[Scotland]], as well as [[Ireland]] and the Commonwealth, are derived from [[English common law]] rather than from Roman roots. [[Scots law]], though also a civil law system, is uncodified; it was strongly influenced by [[Roman-Dutch law|Roman-Dutch]] legal thought, and after the [[Act of Union 1707]], by English law.\n\nThe term \"Napoleonic Code\" is also used to refer to legal codes of other [[jurisdictions]] that are influenced by the ''French Code Napol\u00e9on'', especially the ''[[Civil Code of Lower Canada]]'' (replaced in 1994 by the ''[[Civil Code of Quebec]]''), mainly derived from the ''[[Coutume de Paris]]'', which the British continued to use in Canada following the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763. Most of the laws in [[Latin American]] countries are also heavily based on the Napoleonic Code, e.g. the [[Civil Code (Chile)|Chilean Civil Code]] and the Puerto Rican Civil Code.<ref>{{Citation    |year= 1950 |last=Rabel |first=Ernst   |contribution= Private Laws of Western Civilization: Part II.
