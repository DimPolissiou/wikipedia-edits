He described the movement as follows:<ref name=\":0\">{{harvnb|Driscoll|2006|p=22}}. ''Cited in''\n{{Cite journal|title = Perspicuity of Scripture: The Emergent Approach|journal = [[Master's Seminary|Master's Seminary Journal]]|volume = 17|issue = 2|last = MacArthur|first = John F.|authorlink = John F. MacArthur|year = 2006|url = http://www.tms.edu/tmsj/tmsj17g.pdf|issn = 1066-3959|pages = 12\u201313|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100624213346/http://www.tms.edu/tmsj/tmsj17g.pdf|archivedate = June 24, 2010|df = mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The emerging church is a growing, loosely connected movement of primarily young pastors who are glad to see the end of modernity and are seeking to function as missionaries who bring the gospel of Jesus Christ to emerging and postmodern cultures. The emerging church welcomes the tension of holding in one closed hand the unchanging truth of evangelical Christian theology ({{bibleref2|Jude 3}}) and holding in one open hand the many cultural ways of showing and speaking Christian truth as a missionary to America ({{bibleref2|1 Cor|9:19\u201323}}). Since the movement, if it can be called that, is young and is still defining its theological center, I do not want to portray the movement as ideologically unified because I myself swim in the theologically conservative stream of the emerging church.</blockquote>\n\nDriscoll later distanced himself from the movement:<ref>{{cite web | last = Driscoll | first = Mark | title = Welcome | url = http://theresurgence.com/?q=node/5 | accessdate = July 11, 2010 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110524085722/http://theresurgence.com/?q=node%2F5 | archivedate = May 24, 2011 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n<blockquote>In the mid-1990s I was part of what is now known as the [[emerging church]] and spent some time traveling the country to speak on the emerging church in the emerging culture on a team put together by Leadership Network called the Young Leader Network. But, I eventually had to distance myself from the emergent stream of the network because friends like [[Brian McLaren]] and [[Doug Pagitt]] began pushing a theological agenda that greatly troubled me. Examples include referring to [[Gender of God in Christianity|God as a chick]], questioning [[Attributes of God in Christianity#Sovereignty|God's sovereignty]] over and [[open theism|knowledge of the future]], denial of the [[substitutionary atonement]] at the cross, a low view of Scripture, and denial of [[hell]] which is one hell of a mistake.</blockquote>\n\n=== Gender roles ===\n\nOn gender roles, Driscoll is a [[Complementarianism|complementarian]], believing that men and women have equal worth, but have different roles within the family and the church. He endorses male headship of the home and church.<ref name=\":5\" /> According to a ''Mother Jones'' profile on Driscoll in 1998, he may have held [[Christian egalitarianism|egalitarian]] views at one time. He offered church courses in \"evangelical feminism\" and is quoted as saying \"the Bible is clear that men and women are both created by God in His image and likeness and totally equal in every way.\"<ref name=\"MoJo-1998\" /> In 2003, Driscoll said that he wished he could change the parts of the Bible that he believes restrict women from being pastors.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nMale leadership of the church is crucial, according to Driscoll, who believes that God called him specifically to \"train men.\" He traces many modern spiritual and social problems to the acceptance of female leadership. Driscoll describes Eve's temptation by the serpent in the [[Garden of Eden]] as \"the first invitation to an independent feminism.\" For Eve to eat the forbidden fruit was, according to Driscoll, \"the first exercising of a woman's role in leadership in the home and in the church in the history of the world. It does not go well.\"<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nDriscoll believes that Christianity has been \"feminized\". In a 2006 interview with ''Desiring God'', he said, \"The problem with the church today, it's just a bunch of nice, soft, tender, 'chickified' [''sic''] church boys. Sixty percent of Christians are chicks, and the forty percent that are dudes are still sort of chicks.&nbsp;... The whole architecture and the whole aesthetic [of church buildings and services] is really feminine.\"<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite video| people = Mark Driscoll (interviewee), Josh Brage (contributor)| title = Church Needs Dudes| accessdate = May 5, 2005| date = April 14, 2006 | time = 120 seconds| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lex6orNNzTs}}</ref> In contrast, Driscoll emphasizes what he perceives as macho behavior in the actions of biblical protagonists: he describes [[Jesus]], [[Paul the Apostle]], and [[David|King David]] saying: \"... these guys were dudes. Heterosexual, win-a-fight, punch-you-in-the-nose, dudes.\"<ref name=\":11\" /> He believes that in order to be innovative, the church needs to get entrepreneurial young men involved, who will \"make the culture of the future.\"<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nDriscoll interprets the Apostle Paul as writing that women are encouraged to be an active part of life and ministry in the church, but that only men can teach other men or become \"[[Elder (Christianity)|elder]]-pastors\" (the terms being synonymous). Since Paul's prohibition of female elder-pastors appeals to the Genesis creation story ({{bibleref2|1 Timothy|2:14}}) for its rationale, Driscoll argues that the restriction is permanent and cannot be adjusted for changing culture.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://pastormark.tv/2011/09/20/faq-women-and-ministry|title = FAQ: Women and Ministry|date = September 20, 2011|accessdate = August 1, 2014|website = pastormark.tv|last = Driscoll|first = Mark|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://archive.is/20140806213738/http://pastormark.tv/2011/09/20/faq-women-and-ministry|archivedate = August 6, 2014|df = mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] elected [[Katharine Jefferts Schori]] as its first female [[Presiding Bishop]], Driscoll wrote on his blog that \"if Christian males do not man up soon, the Episcopalians may vote a fluffy baby bunny rabbit as their next bishop to lead God's men.\"<ref>{{Cite web| last = Connelly| first = Joel| title = New bishop brings wit to the job| work = [[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]| date = September 4, 2007| accessdate = May 5, 2014| url = http://www.seattlepi.com/local/connelly/article/New-bishop-brings-wit-to-the-job-1248678.php#src=fb}}</ref>\n\n=== Sexuality ===\nAccording to Salon.com, \"Driscoll has been a key advocate for candid conversations about sexuality among conservative Christians\".<ref name=\":15\" />\n\nIn ''Christians Might Be Crazy'', Driscoll defends marriage as being between a man and a woman saying \"It is clear that Jesus saw the male-female marriage bond of Genesis 1-2 as the prototype for human sexual relationships. Anything outside those boundaries was off limits. Despite this strong evidence, supporters of homosexuality nevertheless often appeal to Jesus, claiming that 'Jesus never condemned homosexuality' or even 'He never mentioned homosexuality'. [...] Jesus was no coward when it came to speaking up in order to rattle conventional thinking and effect change.

He described the movement as follows:<ref name=\":0\">{{harvnb|Driscoll|2006|p=22}}. ''Cited in''\n{{Cite journal|title = Perspicuity of Scripture: The Emergent Approach|journal = [[Master's Seminary|Master's Seminary Journal]]|volume = 17|issue = 2|last = MacArthur|first = John F.|authorlink = John F.

The emerging church welcomes the tension of holding in one closed hand the unchanging truth of evangelical Christian theology ({{bibleref2|Jude 3}}) and holding in one open hand the many cultural ways of showing and speaking Christian truth as a missionary to America ({{bibleref2|1 Cor|9:19\u201323}}). Since the movement, if it can be called that, is young and is still defining its theological center, I do not want to portray the movement as ideologically unified because I myself swim in the theologically conservative stream of the emerging church.</blockquote>\n\nDriscoll later distanced himself from the movement:<ref>{{cite web | last = Driscoll | first = Mark | title = Welcome | url = http://theresurgence.com/?q=node/5 | accessdate = July 11, 2010 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110524085722/http://theresurgence.com/?q=node%2F5 | archivedate = May 24, 2011 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n<blockquote>In the mid-1990s I was part of what is now known as the [[emerging church]] and spent some time traveling the country to speak on the emerging church in the emerging culture on a team put together by Leadership Network called the Young Leader Network. But, I eventually had to distance myself from the emergent stream of the network because friends like [[Brian McLaren]] and [[Doug Pagitt]] began pushing a theological agenda that greatly troubled me. Examples include referring to [[Gender of God in Christianity|God as a chick]], questioning [[Attributes of God in Christianity#Sovereignty|God's sovereignty]] over and [[open theism|knowledge of the future]], denial of the [[substitutionary atonement]] at the cross, a low view of Scripture, and denial of [[hell]] which is one hell of a mistake.</blockquote>\n\n=== Gender roles ===\n\nOn gender roles, Driscoll is a [[Complementarianism|complementarian]], believing that men and women have equal worth, but have different roles within the family and the church. He endorses male headship of the home and church.<ref name=\":5\" /> According to a ''Mother Jones'' profile on Driscoll in 1998, he may have held [[Christian egalitarianism|egalitarian]] views at one time. He offered church courses in \"evangelical feminism\" and is quoted as saying \"the Bible is clear that men and women are both created by God in His image and likeness and totally equal in every way.\"<ref name=\"MoJo-1998\" /> In 2003, Driscoll said that he wished he could change the parts of the Bible that he believes restrict women from being pastors.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nMale leadership of the church is crucial, according to Driscoll, who believes that God called him specifically to \"train men.\" He traces many modern spiritual and social problems to the acceptance of female leadership. Driscoll describes Eve's temptation by the serpent in the [[Garden of Eden]] as \"the first invitation to an independent feminism.\" For Eve to eat the forbidden fruit was, according to Driscoll, \"the first exercising of a woman's role in leadership in the home and in the church in the history of the world. It does not go well.\"<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nDriscoll believes that Christianity has been \"feminized\". In a 2006 interview with ''Desiring God'', he said, \"The problem with the church today, it's just a bunch of nice, soft, tender, 'chickified' [''sic''] church boys. Sixty percent of Christians are chicks, and the forty percent that are dudes are still sort of chicks.&nbsp;... The whole architecture and the whole aesthetic [of church buildings and services] is really feminine.\"<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite video| people = Mark Driscoll (interviewee), Josh Brage (contributor)| title = Church Needs Dudes| accessdate = May 5, 2005| date = April 14, 2006 | time = 120 seconds| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lex6orNNzTs}}</ref> In contrast, Driscoll emphasizes what he perceives as macho behavior in the actions of biblical protagonists: he describes [[Jesus]], [[Paul the Apostle]], and [[David|King David]] saying: \"... these guys were dudes. Heterosexual, win-a-fight, punch-you-in-the-nose, dudes.\"<ref name=\":11\" /> He believes that in order to be innovative, the church needs to get entrepreneurial young men involved, who will \"make the culture of the future.\"<ref name=\":12\" />\n\nDriscoll interprets the Apostle Paul as writing that women are encouraged to be an active part of life and ministry in the church, but that only men can teach other men or become \"[[Elder (Christianity)|elder]]-pastors\" (the terms being synonymous). Since Paul's prohibition of female elder-pastors appeals to the Genesis creation story ({{bibleref2|1 Timothy|2:14}}) for its rationale, Driscoll argues that the restriction is permanent and cannot be adjusted for changing culture.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://pastormark.tv/2011/09/20/faq-women-and-ministry|title = FAQ: Women and Ministry|date = September 20, 2011|accessdate = August 1, 2014|website = pastormark.tv|last = Driscoll|first = Mark|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://archive.is/20140806213738/http://pastormark.tv/2011/09/20/faq-women-and-ministry|archivedate = August 6, 2014|df = mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] elected [[Katharine Jefferts Schori]] as its first female [[Presiding Bishop]], Driscoll wrote on his blog that \"if Christian males do not man up soon, the Episcopalians may vote a fluffy baby bunny rabbit as their next bishop to lead God's men.\"<ref>{{Cite web| last = Connelly| first = Joel| title = New bishop brings wit to the job| work = [[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]| date = September 4, 2007| accessdate = May 5, 2014| url = http://www.seattlepi.com/local/connelly/article/New-bishop-brings-wit-to-the-job-1248678.php#src=fb}}</ref>\n\n=== Sexuality ===\nAccording to Salon.com, \"Driscoll has been a key advocate for candid conversations about sexuality among conservative Christians\".<ref name=\":15\" />\n\nIn ''Christians Might Be Crazy'', Driscoll defends marriage as being between a man and a woman saying \"It is clear that Jesus saw the male-female marriage bond of Genesis 1-2 as the prototype for human sexual relationships. Anything outside those boundaries was off limits. Despite this strong evidence, supporters of homosexuality nevertheless often appeal to Jesus, claiming that 'Jesus never condemned homosexuality' or even 'He never mentioned homosexuality'.

It's also hinted that Dada develops feelings for Pucca since then and doesn't think Garu is right for her. Hence, he teamed up with Ring-Ring again in \"He Loves Me Not\" to pretend to be Garu and divert his feelings for Ring-Ring.

He has a rather simple-minded nephew named Ayo.\n\n==Minor villains==\n\n===Cat Clan===\nThey are rivals to Mio (Garu's cat) and are all in love with Yani (Pucca's cat). Although its never mentioned in the show, their names are, according to the Jetix website are: [[Brutus]], [[Socrates]], and [[Napoleon]].\n\n===Doga===\n: Voiced by: [[Kathleen Barr]]\nAn evil witch with a foul temper, she attacks anyone if they so much as step on her shadow.

This includes many jobs; such as being a doctor, a taxi driver and a shopkeeper. He is usually an unwitting victim of Pucca when she is after Garu. In one episode, Santa signs up to become a ninja like Garu. Before he became Santa, he was known as a thief called Red Lantern who used to work in pair with a ninja named Black Powder.\n\n===Dada===\n: Voiced by: Lee Tockar (2006-2008), [[Todd Haberkorn]] (2018-)\n: Age: 10-11 in Season 1, 11-12 in Season 2, 12-13 in Season 3\nDada is a dishwasher and waiter at the Goh-Rong restaurant. He is usually nervous, high-strung, and clumsy, frequently making accidents in the kitchen. He has a crush on Ring-Ring, until after the way she treated him in the end of \"Soap Opera\". In \"Chef Napped,\" he helped Ring-Ring kidnap noodle chefs from around the world, including the chefs: Dumpling, Ho and Linguini (as a form of revenge for the way they mistreated him). He and Ring-Ring were both foiled by Garu, Pucca and their friends. Dada once became Ring-Ring's boyfriend in \"Soap Opera,\" thanks to Mister Dishey (a bubble genie). When he was exposed by Pucca to everyone, Ring-Ring was furious and left him. Despite this, she is sympathetic towards him, as he often feels down and is grateful for her kindness. It's also hinted that Dada develops feelings for Pucca since then and doesn't think Garu is right for her. Hence, he teamed up with Ring-Ring again in \"He Loves Me Not\" to pretend to be Garu and divert his feelings for Ring-Ring. It was his attempt to show Pucca that she was wasting her time chasing after Garu and she should be with him instead. When Garu exposes Dada as the imposter, everyone was shocked. However, Pucca is angry with him for it because his actions was a form of betrayal to their friendship.\n\n===Destiny===\nDestiny is a golden Chinese-style dragon who lives in a cave behind the waterfall in Sooga Lake. Destiny is a lounge singer and piano player. He and Pucca attempted to plan a romantic date with her and Garu. Garu walked off, but when Destiny said that because he left Pucca crying, he has no honor he fights him. In the end, Pucca helped him to score his first gig in five hundred years performing at the Goh-Rong. He reappeared in \"Chef Napped!\" where he flew the gang to Las Vegas for the World of Noodles Convention, and helped to rescue the chefs when they were kidnapped. He also appeared in \"Enter the Dragon Girls\" as the Dragon Girls' troop leader. He was also seen in \"Full Moon Pucca,\" when Garu was lip-synching, Destiny was behind a fence, doing the real singing. And in \"Garu Hood,\" he ate the last noodle bowl so Garu Hood (aka Robin Hood) had to get it back. Destiny ended up eating Garu, Abyo, and Dada until Pucca beat him. Destiny can fly (though he has no wings), and breathe fire, but in addition, he can make himself grow larger by roaring or singing.\n\n===Master Soo===\n: Voiced by: [[Richard Newman (actor)|Richard Newman]]\nA man who is always surrounded by beautiful handmaidens. He acts as a being of all knowledge, and is often seen riding on a cloud. Garu admires him.

He practiced martial arts many years in a Shaolin temple, but left there to seek better martial art skills. He is a rival to Abyo.\n\n===Mio===\nGaru's beloved black cat. It is said the time can be told by looking at Mio's eyes. He seems capable of performing a feline form of martial arts and is in love with Yani (Pucca's cat). He also hates to go to the vet's office to get a shot. Mio only went there because Yani was there as a moral support.\n\n===Won===\nChing's pet chicken who is often seen on the top of her head. She is known to lay powerful eggs which lead Tobe to try and capture Won with failed results.\n\n===Yani===\nPucca's pink cat, Yani is the most popular cat in Sooga village. She always gives the paw, being a snob cat. She is loved by Mio and the Cat Clan, who are Mio's rivals. Yani is in love with Mio and doesn't like the Cat Clan.\n\n===Yuni===\nRing-Ring's pet [[Shih Tzu|shih tzu]]. She is considered to be Yani's rival. Yuni can either be seen being an accomplice to Ring Ring in trying to one up Pucca or trying to stop her. The latter was evident in \"Ring-Ring's Party Favors\" when she was carrying an envelope (with an invitation to Ring-Ring for Pucca's party). Yuni was scolded by Ring-Ring in \"Little Miss Sooga\" for getting the silkworms and making Pucca's dress look better than hers.\n\n==Minor characters==\n\n===Policeman Bruce===\n: Voiced by: Dale Wilson (2006-2008), [[Kirk Thornton]] (2018-)\nAbyo's father, he usually chases after Abyo when he is being 'antisocial' (or destructive). His wife is never seen or mentioned. He usually says \"Over\" after nearly everything he says, as if he were talking in police parlance.\n\n===Chang===\n: Voiced by: [[Michael Daingerfield]] (2006-2008), Todd Haberkorn (2018-)\nChang is Ching's father. He is the master of Turtle Training Hall and teaches Ching, Garu, Ssoso and Abyo martial arts. His best friend is Policeman Bruce.\n\n===Goblins (Smiley Men)===\nCommon civilians. They are paper-like creatures. Their gender is determined by their color - blue being male, and pink being female. These smiley people can also build things fairly quickly. They are usually seen everywhere in Sooga village. They are also useful in helping others. They have special abilities as well such as control over fire or water, and can also combine to form one giant smiley man if their emotions run high, such as if they were angry.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pucca Characters, List Of}}\n[[Category:Lists of characters in South Korean television animation]]\n[[Category:Martial artists characters in television]]\n", "name_user": "John of Reading", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePucca:Typo fixing, replaced: eventhough \u2192 even though", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pucca_characters"}
