The school is approximately {{convert|5|mi}} away from the intersection of two major highways, [[State Road 9 (Indiana)|State Road 9]] and [[U.S. Route 52]]; it draws students from as far as the vicinity of [[Fountaintown, Indiana|Fountaintown]].\n\n==District==\nAll Morristown and [[Waldron, Indiana|Waldron]] schools are part of [[Shelby Eastern Schools]]. The administration building is located very near [[Rays Crossing, Indiana|Rays Crossing]], and is almost equidistant from both Morristown and Waldron schools. Shelby Eastern School Corporation is one of four [[School districts|school corporations]] within Shelby County.\n\n==Education==\nMorristown Jr.-Sr. High School offers four types of degrees: the regular diploma, the Core 40 diploma, the Academic Honors Diploma, and the Technical Honors Diploma. Each of these has a separate set of criteria as defined by the [[Indiana Department of Education|Indiana State Board of Education]]. While most high schools offer a fair amount of [[AP courses]] for their students to take, Morristown High School is still struggling for these classes as well as for staff qualified to teach them.{{Citation needed}} As of 2007, the following AP classes are offered: [[AP United States History|US History]] (added 2005-06 school year), [[AP Calculus|Calculus AB]], [[AP Statistics|Statistics]], [[AP Literature|Literature]], [[AP English Language and Composition|Composition]]. [[Dual enrollment|Dual Credit]] courses have been hosted by [[Ivy Tech]], but students must pass the [[PSAT/NMSQT|PSAT]] with a certain score or pass the [[COMPASS]] exam in order to take the course. In the 2009-2010 school year, these courses included [[Psychology]] and [[Personal finance]].{{Citation needed}}\n\nStudents at Morristown Jr.-Sr. High School also have the opportunity to attend Blue River for vocational classes that earn themselves credits for a Technical Honors Diploma. Some of the courses include health sciences, auto technology and collision, and informatics.\n\n[[Distance education|Distance learning]] has also begun to take root at the school. Students are connected to another school by television and learn from a teacher in a completely different location. This takes effect for AP US History (teacher from Morristown), Physics (teacher from Waldron), and Personal Finance (teacher from Blue River).\n\n==Athletics==\nMorristown offers several sports activities for both boys and girls to participate in. Boys may participate in the following sports: soccer, tennis, cross country, basketball, baseball, track, and golf. Girls may participate in: cross country, volleyball, basketball, gymnastics, softball, tennis, track, and golf.\n\nAt one point, Morristown Jr.-Sr. High School had a football team (1979-1984). However, rising costs, lack of funds, and dwindling student interest (the team had only 22 players its final year, according to former assistant coach and current teacher Pat Kohne) led to the sport being discontinued. The old football scoreboard and lights have been taken down and replaced by a soccer scoreboard. Soccer is now on Morristown's map having won three sectional titles. Despite student interest in re-establishing a football team in recent years, present school funds do not allow for such an endeavor.{{Citation needed}}\n\nIn 2004, Morristown won a state championship in girl's volleyball, defeating [[Marquette Catholic High School (Michigan City, Indiana)|Michigan City Marquette]] in the first three sets<ref>https://www.ihsaa.org/dnn/Sports/Girls/Volleyball/State-Champions</ref>.\n\nIn 2018, Morristown won a state championship in boy's basketball, defeating [[Southwood Junior-Senior High School|Southwood High School]] 89 to 60<ref>https://www.ihsaa.org/dnn/Sports/Boys/Basketball/State-Champions</ref>.\n\n==Activities==\nAlongside athletics, there are a variety of activities offered to students. Although some activities are gender-exclusive, every student has something to choose from. The activities include: Academic Super Bowl & Spell Bowl, Art Club, Drama Club, French Club, [[National Honor Society]], Varsity Club, [[FIRST]] Robotics (now teamed with [[Greenfield-Central High School]]){{Citation Needed}}, Shelby County Youth Drug Free Coalition, Spanish Club, [[Student Council]], Sunshine Society, [[Students Against Destructive Decisions|SADD]], Marching Band, Pep Band and Jazz Band.\n\n==Demographics & Trends==\nAccording to the state of Indiana's annual report on public schools:\n* The school is 94.7% [[White people|white]], with 301 of its 318 students identifying as white.

The school is approximately {{convert|5|mi}} away from the intersection of two major highways, [[State Road 9 (Indiana)|State Road 9]] and [[U.S. Route 52]]; it draws students from as far as the vicinity of [[Fountaintown, Indiana|Fountaintown]].\n\n==District==\nAll Morristown and [[Waldron, Indiana|Waldron]] schools are part of [[Shelby Eastern Schools]]. The administration building is located very near [[Rays Crossing, Indiana|Rays Crossing]], and is almost equidistant from both Morristown and Waldron schools. Shelby Eastern School Corporation is one of four [[School districts|school corporations]] within Shelby County.\n\n==Education==\nMorristown Jr.-Sr. High School offers four types of degrees: the regular diploma, the Core 40 diploma, the Academic Honors Diploma, and the Technical Honors Diploma. Each of these has a separate set of criteria as defined by the [[Indiana Department of Education|Indiana State Board of Education]]. While most high schools offer a fair amount of [[AP courses]] for their students to take, Morristown High School is still struggling for these classes as well as for staff qualified to teach them.{{Citation needed}} As of 2007, the following AP classes are offered: [[AP United States History|US History]] (added 2005-06 school year), [[AP Calculus|Calculus AB]], [[AP Statistics|Statistics]], [[AP Literature|Literature]], [[AP English Language and Composition|Composition]]. [[Dual enrollment|Dual Credit]] courses have been hosted by [[Ivy Tech]], but students must pass the [[PSAT/NMSQT|PSAT]] with a certain score or pass the [[COMPASS]] exam in order to take the course. In the 2009-2010 school year, these courses included [[Psychology]] and [[Personal finance]].{{Citation needed}}\n\nStudents at Morristown Jr.-Sr. High School also have the opportunity to attend Blue River for vocational classes that earn themselves credits for a Technical Honors Diploma. Some of the courses include health sciences, auto technology and collision, and informatics.\n\n[[Distance education|Distance learning]] has also begun to take root at the school. Students are connected to another school by television and learn from a teacher in a completely different location. This takes effect for AP US History (teacher from Morristown), Physics (teacher from Waldron), and Personal Finance (teacher from Blue River).\n\n==Athletics==\nMorristown offers several sports activities for both boys and girls to participate in. Boys may participate in the following sports: soccer, tennis, cross country, basketball, baseball, track, and golf. Girls may participate in: cross country, volleyball, basketball, gymnastics, softball, tennis, track, and golf.\n\nAt one point, Morristown Jr.-Sr. High School had a football team (1979-1984). However, rising costs, lack of funds, and dwindling student interest (the team had only 22 players its final year, according to former assistant coach and current teacher Pat Kohne) led to the sport being discontinued. The old football scoreboard and lights have been taken down and replaced by a soccer scoreboard. Soccer is now on Morristown's map having won three sectional titles. Despite student interest in re-establishing a football team in recent years, present school funds do not allow for such an endeavor.{{Citation needed}}\n\nIn 2004, Morristown won a state championship in girl's volleyball, defeating [[Marquette Catholic High School (Michigan City, Indiana)|Michigan City Marquette]] in the first three sets<ref>https://www.ihsaa.org/dnn/Sports/Girls/Volleyball/State-Champions</ref>.\n\nIn 2018, Morristown won a state championship in boy's basketball, defeating [[Southwood Junior-Senior High School|Southwood High School]] 89 to 60<ref>https://www.ihsaa.org/dnn/Sports/Boys/Basketball/State-Champions</ref>.\n\n==Activities==\nAlongside athletics, there are a variety of activities offered to students. Although some activities are gender-exclusive, every student has something to choose from. The activities include: Academic Super Bowl & Spell Bowl, Art Club, Drama Club, French Club, [[National Honor Society]], Varsity Club, [[FIRST]] Robotics (now teamed with [[Greenfield-Central High School]]){{Citation Needed}}, Shelby County Youth Drug Free Coalition, Spanish Club, [[Student Council]], Sunshine Society, [[Students Against Destructive Decisions|SADD]], Marching Band, Pep Band and Jazz Band.\n\n==Demographics & Trends==\nAccording to the state of Indiana's annual report on public schools for recent years:\n* The school is 94.7% [[White people|white]], with 301 of its 318 students identifying as white. There are 10 [[Hispanic people|Hispanic]] students enrolled at the school (3.1%), along with 2 [[Asian people|Asian]] students (0.6%), 1 [[African Americans|Black]] student (0.3%), and 4 [[Multiracial people|multiracial]] students (1.3%).<ref>https://compass.doe.in.gov/dashboard/overview.aspx?type=school&id=7661</ref>\n* 114 students (35.9%) receive free or reduced meals.<ref>https://compass.doe.in.gov/dashboard/overview.aspx?type=school&id=7661</ref>\n* 35.7% (10 teachers) of teachers have 20+ years of experience, 3.6% (1) have 16-20 years of experience, 17.9% (5) have 11-15 years of experience, 17.9% (5) have 6-10 year of experience, and 25% (7) have up to 5 years experience. <ref>https://compass.doe.in.gov/dashboard/personnel.aspx?type=school&id=7661</ref> \n* 100% of enrolled seniors graduated in academic year 2018-2019.<ref>https://compass.doe.in.gov/dashboard/graduates.aspx?type=school&id=7661</ref>\n* The average (mean) class size is 45.4 students.<ref>https://compass.doe.in.gov/dashboard/enrollment.aspx?type=school&id=7661</ref>\n* Enrollment has decreased significantly since the academic year of 2005-2006.

Many cross-sections are scanned over time to get a 3D view of the retina over time.  Low-coherence interferometry is used to perform each B-scan.  The device shines an infrared laser onto the retina and measures the interference patterns of the light that is backscattered from the tissue.<ref name=\"Jia et al 2012b\"/> Areas of change between each sequential B-scan can then be distinguished as sites of blood flow.  The B-scans are then added together to get a 3D image of the retina. The resulting image provides structural and functional information of the retinal layers and the vasculature found at each layer, as shown in Figure 1 from Gao et al.<ref name=\"GaoJia2016\" />  Interpretation of the OCT scans and segmentation of the retinal layers rely on software analysis of the collected data.  However, once the data processed, OCTA is capable of providing images of the retinal and choroidal vasculature which, as seen in Figure 1, can be split into five layers: the superficial plexus, the deep plexus, the outer retina, the choriocapillaris, and the deeper choroid.\n\n=== Calculating blood flow ===\nAn algorithm developed by Jia et al.,<ref name=\"Jia et al 2012b\">{{cite journal| pmc=3381646 | pmid=22418228 | doi=10.1364/OE.20.004710 | volume=20 | title=Split-spectrum amplitude-decorrelation angiography with optical coherence tomography | year=2012 | journal=Opt Express | pages=4710\u201325 | last1 = Jia | first1 = Y | last2 = Tan | first2 = O | last3 = Tokayer | first3 = J | last4 = Potsaid | first4 = B | last5 = Wang | first5 = Y | last6 = Liu | first6 = JJ | last7 = Kraus | first7 = MF | last8 = Subhash | first8 = H | last9 = Fujimoto | first9 = JG | last10 = Hornegger | first10 = J | last11 = Huang | first11 = D}}</ref> is used to determine blood flow in the retina. The split-spectrum amplitude decorrelation angiography (SSADA) algorithm calculates the decorrelation in the reflected light that is detected by the OCT device.\n\nThe blood vessels are where the most decorrelation occurs allowing them to be visualized, while static tissue has low decorrelation values.<ref name=\"Koustenis et al 2017\">[https://bjo.bmj.com/content/101/1/16.long Koustenis A, Harris A, Gross J, et al Optical coherence tomography angiography: an overview of the technology and an assessment of applications for clinical research British Journal of Ophthalmology 2017;101:16-20.]</ref>  The equation takes into account fluctuations of the received signal amplitude or intensity over time.  Greater fluctuations receive a greater decorrelation value and indicate more movement.\n\nA significant challenge when trying to image the eye is patient movement and saccadic movement of the eye. Movement introduces a lot of noise into the signal making tiny vessels impossible to distinguish.

Many cross-sections are scanned over time to get a 3D view of the retina over time.  Low-coherence interferometry is used to perform each B-scan.  The device shines an infrared laser onto the retina and measures the interference patterns of the light that is backscattered from the tissue.<ref name=\"Jia et al 2012b\"/> Areas of change between each sequential B-scan can then be distinguished as sites of blood flow.  The B-scans are then added together to get a 3D image of the retina. The resulting image provides structural and functional information of the retinal layers and the vasculature found at each layer, as shown in Figure 1 from Gao et al.<ref name=\"GaoJia2016\" />  Interpretation of the OCT scans and segmentation of the retinal layers rely on software analysis of the collected data.  However, once the data processed, OCTA is capable of providing images of the retinal and choroidal vasculature which, as seen in Figure 1, can be split into five layers: the superficial plexus, the deep plexus, the outer retina, the choriocapillaris, and the deeper choroid.\n\n=== Calculating blood flow ===\nAn algorithm developed by Jia et al.,<ref name=\"Jia et al 2012b\">[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3381646/ Jia et al 2012b.

Split-spectrum amplitude-decorrelation angiography with optical coherence tomography. Opt. Express, 20 (2012), pp. 4710-4725.]</ref> is used to determine blood flow in the retina. The split-spectrum amplitude decorrelation angiography (SSADA) algorithm calculates the decorrelation in the reflected light that is detected by the OCT device.\n\nThe blood vessels are where the most decorrelation occurs allowing them to be visualized, while static tissue has low decorrelation values.<ref name=\"Koustenis et al 2017\">[https://bjo.bmj.com/content/101/1/16.long Koustenis A, Harris A, Gross J, et al Optical coherence tomography angiography: an overview of the technology and an assessment of applications for clinical research British Journal of Ophthalmology 2017;101:16-20.]</ref>  The equation takes into account fluctuations of the received signal amplitude or intensity over time.  Greater fluctuations receive a greater decorrelation value and indicate more movement.\n\nA significant challenge when trying to image the eye is patient movement and saccadic movement of the eye. Movement introduces a lot of noise into the signal making tiny vessels impossible to distinguish. One approach to decreasing the influence of movement on signal detection is to shorten the scanning time. A short scan time prevents too much patient movement during signal acquisition. With the development of Fourier-domain OCT, spectral-domain OCT, and swept source signal acquisition time was greatly improved making OCTA possible.<ref name=\"GaoJia2016\" />  OCTA scan time is now around three seconds, however, saccadic eye movement still causes a low signal-to-noise ratio.

OED Online. September 2019. Oxford University Press. https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/151368 (accessed October 26, 2019).</ref> is the right, by law or custom, of the firstborn legitimate son to [[inheritance|inherit]] his parent's entire or main [[estate (law)|estate]] in preference to shared inheritance among all or some children, any illegitimate child or any collateral relative. In some contexts it instead means the inheritance of the firstborn child (absolute primogeniture) or the firstborn daughter (matrilineal primogeniture).\n\nThe first definition given is also known as male-line primogeniture, the classical form popular in European jurisdictions among others until into the 20th century. In the absence of male-line offspring, variations were expounded to entitle a daughter or a brother or, in the absence of either, to another collateral relative, in a specified order (e.g. male-preference primogeniture, Salic primogeniture, semi-Salic primogeniture). Variations have tempered the traditional, sole-beneficiary, right (such as French [[appanage]]) or, in the West since World War II, eliminate the preference for males over females (absolute male-preference primogeniture). Most [[monarchies in Europe|monarchies in Western Europe]] have eliminated this, in succession: [[Monarchy of Belgium|Belgium]], [[Monarchy of Denmark|Denmark]], [[Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Luxembourg]], [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|Netherlands]], [[Monarchy of Norway|Norway]], [[Monarchy of Sweden|Sweden]] and the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]].\n\nEnglish primogeniture endures mainly in titles of nobility: any first-placed direct male-line descendant (e.g. eldest son's son's son) inherits the title before siblings and similar, this being termed \"by right of substitution\" for the deceased heir; secondly where children were only daughters they would enjoy the fettered use (life use) of an equal amount of the underlying real asset and the substantive free use (such as one-half inheritance) would accrue to their most senior-line male descendant or contingent on her marriage ([[Moiety title|moieties]]); thirdly, where the late estate holder had no descendants his oldest brother would succeed, and his descendants would likewise enjoy the rule of substitution where he had died. The effect of English primogeniture was to keep estates undivided wherever possible and to disinherit real property from female relations unless only daughters survived in which case the estate thus normally results in division. The principle has applied in history to inheritance of land as well as inherited titles and offices, most notably monarchies, continuing until modified or abolished.\n\nOther forms of inheritance in monarchies have existed or continue. The [[Holy Roman Emperor]] was selected for enthronement by a small number of powerful [[prince elector]]s from among Europe's Christian males of inherited [[nobility]]. Currently, [[succession to the Saudi Arabian throne]] uses a form of lateral [[agnatic seniority]], as did the [[Kievan Rus']] (see [[Rota system]]), the early [[Kingdom of Scotland]] (see [[Tanistry]]), the [[Mongol Empire]] (see [[Order of succession#Lateral succession|lateral succession]]) or the later [[Ottoman Empire]] (see [[Line of succession to the former Ottoman throne#Succession practices|succession practices]]).\n\nResearch shows that authoritarian regimes that rely on primogeniture for succession were more stable than forms of authoritarian rule with alternative succession arrangements.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kurrild-Klitgaard|first=Peter|date=2000|title=The constitutional economics of autocratic succession|journal=Public Choice|volume=103|issue=1/2|pages=63\u201384|doi=10.1023/A:1005078532251|issn=0048-5829}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kurrild-Klitgaard|first=Peter|date=2004|title=Autocratic succession|journal=Encyclopedia of Public Choice|volume=103|pages=358\u2013362|doi=10.1007/978-0-306-47828-4_39|isbn=978-0-306-47828-4}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kokkonen|first=Andrej|last2=Sundell|first2=Anders|date=May 2014|title=Delivering Stability\u2014Primogeniture and Autocratic Survival in European Monarchies 1000\u20131800|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=108|issue=2|pages=438\u2013453|doi=10.1017/S000305541400015X|issn=0003-0554}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Acharya|first=Avidit|last2=Lee|first2=Alexander|date=2019-11-01|title=Path Dependence in European Development: Medieval Politics, Conflict, and State Building|journal=Comparative Political Studies|volume=52|issue=13\u201314|pages=2171\u20132206|doi=10.1177/0010414019830716|issn=0010-4140|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ec8206be437f5963855144ee401a2d2336fbe9ad}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kokkonen|first=Andrej|last2=Sundell|first2=Anders|date=2019-06-11|title=Leader Succession and Civil War|journal=Comparative Political Studies|pages=0010414019852712|doi=10.1177/0010414019852712|issn=0010-4140}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/tracking-the-arab-spring-why-the-modest-harvest/|title=Tracking the \"Arab Spring\": Why the Modest Harvest?|website=Journal of Democracy|access-date=2019-10-27}}</ref>\n\n==Order of succession in monarchies today==\n[[File:Order of succession (Primogeniture) in the monarchies of the World.png|thumb|[[World]] [[Monarchy|monarchies]] by succession:\n{{legend|#880015|[[Absolute primogeniture]]}}\n{{legend|#A349A4|[[Elective monarchy|Elective]] and [[agnatic primogeniture]]}}\n{{legend|#22B14C|[[Agnatic primogeniture]]}}\n{{legend|#FF7F27|[[Elective monarchy|Elective]]}}\n{{legend|#3F48CC|[[Male primogeniture|Male-preference primogeniture]]}}\n{{legend|red|[[Agnatic seniority]]}}]]\n[[File:Order of succession (Primogeniture) in European monarchies.png|thumb|[[Monarchies in Europe|European monarchies]] by succession:\n{{legend|#A52A2A|Absolute primogeniture}}\n{{legend|green|Agnatic primogeniture}}\n{{legend|#FF7E00|[[Elective monarchy|Elective]]}}\n{{legend|#0048BA|Male-preference primogeniture}}]]\n{{anchor|Absolute cognatic primogeniture}}\n[[File:Order of succession (Primogeniture) in African monarchies.png|thumb|[[Monarchies in Africa|African monarchies]] by succession:\n{{legend|green|Agnatic primogeniture}}\n{{legend|#FF7E00|[[Elective monarchy|Elective]]}}\n{{legend|#0048BA|Male-preference primogeniture}}]]\n[[File:Order of succession (Primogeniture) in Southeast Asia monarchies.png|thumb|[[Monarchies in Asia|Southeast Asian monarchies]] by succession:\n{{legend|#89000D|Absolute primogeniture}}\n{{legend|#A447A5|[[Elective monarchy|Elective]] and Agnatic primogeniture}}\n{{legend|#1CB34B|Agnatic primogeniture}}\n{{legend|#FF8022|[[Elective monarchy|Elective]]}}\n{{legend|#0000FF|Male-preference primogeniture}}]]\n[[File:Order of succession (Primogeniture) in Middle Eastern monarchies.png|thumb|[[Monarchies in Asia|Middle Eastern monarchies]] by succession:\n{{legend|#A52A2A|Absolute primogeniture}}\n{{legend|#800080|[[Elective monarchy|Elective]] and Agnatic primogeniture}}\n{{legend|green|Agnatic primogeniture}}\n{{legend|#FF7E00|[[Agnatic seniority]]}}\n{{legend|#0000FF|Male-preference primogeniture}}]]\n\n===Absolute primogeniture===\n[[File:Absolute cognatic primogeniture diagram.svg|thumb|Absolute cognatic primogeniture diagram]]\n<!-- This section is forward referenced and linked from [[Westeros]] and [[Hundred Years' War]]. -->\n''Absolute'', ''equal'', or ''lineal primogeniture'' is a form of primogeniture in which gender is irrelevant for inheritance.

Eventually only the Basque lower nobility and free families of the Basque country and other regions continued to follow this custom, which persisted as late as the 19th century.<ref name=\"a\u00eenesse int\u00e9grale\" />\n\nAn ancient and alternative way in which women succeeded to power, especially without displacing the direct male line descendants of the first monarchs, was consortium or [[coregency]] between husband and wife or other relatives. The most notable are the Egyptian cases of [[Hatshepsut]] and [[Thutmose III]], and the monarchs of the [[Ptolemaic Dynasty]].\n\nIn 1980, [[Sweden]] amended its [[constitution]] to adopt royal succession by absolute primogeniture, displacing King [[Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden|Carl XVI Gustaf]]'s infant son, [[Prince Carl Philip]], in favor of his elder daughter, [[Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden|Princess Victoria]], in the process. Several monarchies have since followed suit: the [[Netherlands]] in 1983, [[Norway]] in 1990, [[Belgium]] in 1991, [[Denmark]] in 2009, [[Luxembourg]] in 2011, and the [[Commonwealth realms]] in 2015.\n\n[[Monaco]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Norway]] also deviated from traditional primogeniture in the late 20th or early 21st century by restricting succession to the crown to relatives within a specified degree of [[kinship]] to the most recent monarch.\n\nRecently, other monarchies have changed or considered changing to absolute primogeniture:\n\n* With the birth of [[Infanta Leonor of Spain]] on 31 October 2005 to the then heir apparent [[Felipe VI of Spain|Felipe, Prince of Asturias]], and [[Queen Letizia of Spain|Princess Letizia]], the Spanish Prime Minister [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero]] reaffirmed the intention of the government to institute, by amendment of the Spanish constitution, absolute primogeniture. Zapatero's proposal was supported by the leader of the main opposition party, the conservative ''[[People's Party (Spain)|Partido Popular]]'', making its passage probable. However, Zapatero's administration ended before an amendment was drafted, and the succeeding government has not pursued it. The Prince counseled reformers that there was plenty of time before any constitutional amendment would need to be enacted because the expectation was to leave him next in line to succeed his father despite his elder sisters' continued status as [[dynasty#Dynasts|dynasts]]; equal primogeniture was expected to apply first to his children. Felipe succeeded to the throne as Felipe VI upon his father's abdication in 2014, by which time he had two daughters. Felipe VI has no son that would, absent the constitutional amendment, displace Leonor as heir apparent.\n* In July 2006, the [[Nepal]]ese government proposed adopting absolute primogeniture,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newkerala.com/news3.php?action=fullnews&id=31256 |title=New Kerala}}</ref> but the monarchy was abolished in 2008 before the change could be effected.\n* In 2011, the governments of the 16 [[Commonwealth realm]]s which have a common monarch announced the [[Perth Agreement]], a plan to legislate changes to absolute primogeniture.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Watt |first=Nicholas |date=28 October 2011 |accessdate=28 October 2011 |title=Royal equality act will end succession of firstborn male \u2013 rather than older sister |work=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/oct/28/commonwealth-royalty-succession-change}}</ref> This was implemented when the necessary legislation came into effect on 26 March 2015.\n* In [[Japan]], it has been debated whether or not to adopt absolute primogeniture, as [[Princess Aiko]] is the only child of [[Naruhito|Emperor Naruhito]]. However, the birth in 2006 of [[Prince Hisahito of Akishino|Prince Hisahito]], a son of [[Prince Akishino]] (the younger brother of Naruhito, and next in line to the [[Chrysanthemum Throne]]) has suspended the debate.\n\n===Agnatic primogeniture===\n[[File:Agnatic primogeniture diagram.svg|thumb|Agnatic primogeniture diagram]]\nUnder agnatic primogeniture, or patrilineal primogeniture, the degree of kinship (of males and females) is determined by tracing shared descent from the nearest common ancestor through male ancestors.<ref name=\"Murphy\">{{Cite web |last=Murphy |first=Michael Dean |title=A Kinship Glossary: Symbols, Terms, and Concepts |url=http://www.as.ua.edu/ant/Faculty/murphy/436/kinship.htm |accessdate=5 October 2006}}</ref> Those who share agnatic kinship (through solely male ancestors) are termed \"agnates\"; those whose shared lineage includes a female ancestor are \"cognates\".\n\nThere were different types of succession based on agnatic primogeniture, all sharing the principle that inheritance is according to seniority of birth among siblings (compare to [[ultimogeniture]]) and seniority of lineage among the agnatic kin, firstly, among the sons of a monarch or [[paterfamilias|head of family]], with sons and their male-line issue inheriting before brothers and their issue. Females and female-line descendants are excluded from succession.\n\n===Male-preference primogeniture===\n[[File:Male-preference primogeniture diagram.svg|thumb|Male-preference primogeniture diagram]]\nMale-preference primogeniture accords succession to the throne to a female member of a [[dynasty]] if and only if she has no living brothers and no deceased brothers who left surviving legitimate descendants. A [[Dynasty#Dynasts|dynast]]'s sons and their lines of descent all come before that dynast's daughters and their lines. Older sons and their lines come before younger sons and their lines. Older daughters and their lines come before younger daughters and their lines.\n\nIt was practised in the succession to the once-separate thrones of [[England]] and [[Scotland]] (until their union under [[James VI and I]]) and then the [[United Kingdom]] until 2015, when the [[Succession to the Crown Act 2013]] changed it to absolute primogeniture. The rule change also applies to all [[Commonwealth realm]]s that have the British monarch as their head of state.\n\nMale-preference primogeniture is currently practised in succession to the thrones of [[Monaco]] and [[Spain]] (before 1700 and since [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1830|1830]]).\n\nWith respect to [[hereditary title]]s, it is usually the rule for Scotland and [[Hereditary peer#Writs of summons|baronies by writ]] in the United Kingdom, but baronies by writ go into [[abeyance]] when the last male titleholder dies leaving more than one surviving sister or more than one descendant in the legitimate female line of the original titleholder.\n\n==Salic law==\nAn [[agnatic seniority]] primogeniture system that excludes any female from inheritance of a monarch's principal possessions is generally known in western Europe as an application of the \"[[Salic law]]\" (see ''[[Terra salica]]''). This rule developed among successions in France in the later Middle Ages. In 1316, [[Joan II of Navarre|Joan]], the only surviving child of [[Louis X of France]], was debarred from the throne in favor of her uncle, [[Philip V of France|Philip, Count of Poitiers]]. After this it was declared that women could not inherit the French throne. Then in 1328, after the death of [[Charles IV of France|Charles IV]], [[Philip VI of France|Philip, Count of Valois]] (Charles IV's paternal cousin), became king, notwithstanding the claims of [[Edward III of England]]. By [[proximity of blood]], Edward was closest related as eldest son of the sister of Charles, [[Isabella of France|Isabella]]. The assemblies of the French barons and prelates and the University of Paris resolved that males who derive their right to inheritance through their mother should be excluded.  This ruling became a key point of contention in the subsequent [[Hundred Years War]]. Over the following century, French jurists adopted a clause from the 6th century ''[[Salic law|Pactus Legis Salicae]]'', which asserted that no female or her descendants could inherit the throne, as a governing rule for the French succession.\n\nIn the lands of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s conquests, Salic law was adopted, including the [[First French Empire|French Empire]], the [[Kingdom of Westphalia]], the [[Kingdom of Holland]] and, under Napoleonic influence, the [[House of Bernadotte]]'s Sweden. Other states adopted Salic primogeniture as well, including Belgium, Denmark ([[Frederick VII of Denmark#Succession crisis|in 1853]]) and all of the eastern European monarchies except Greece, i.e. [[Albanian Kingdom (1928\u201339)|Albania]],  [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Principality of Montenegro|Montenegro]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], and [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]]. During this era, Spain (in the [[Carlist Wars|Carlist conflicts]]) fought a [[civil war]] which pitted the Salic and female-line heirs of the ruling dynasty against one another for possession of the crown.\n\nA variation of Salic primogeniture allowed the sons of women to inherit, but not women themselves, an example being the [[Francisco Franco|Francoist]] succession to the throne of Spain that was applied in 1947&ndash;1978.\n\n;British and French titles of nobility\n\nMany descend by salic, male primogeniture so have a greater average rate of extinction. Many others if the title is otherwise to be extinct pass to the closest elder sister or a line of descendants to the last holder, as abeyant holders, such being parents or ancestors to whichever direct male descendant is first born to 'settle the abeyance'. Some senior agnatic [[cadet (genealogy)|cadets]] are granted from the outset [[courtesy titles|courtesy]] or [[subsidiary title|subsidiary]] titles. Notable English exceptions are the [[Duchy of Lancaster]], which is merged with the [[British Crown]] which has included women in inheritance since the 16th century, and the [[Duke of Marlborough (title)|Dukedom of Marlborough]], which has done so since its establishment in 1702.\n\n==Preference for males==\n{{See also|Death in childbirth|female infertility|coverture|civil war}}\nThe preference for males existing in most systems of primogeniture (and in other mechanisms of hereditary succession) comes mostly from the perceived nature of the tasks and role of the monarch: a monarch/[[prince]] (the latter means in latin chieftain) most usually was, first and foremost, a military leader, as in the millennia-old [[Book of Numbers]].<ref>\"you: Eleazor the Priest and Joshua son of Nun. And you shall also take a chieftain from each tribe through whom the land shall be apportioned. These are the names of the men...{{Bibleverse|Numbers|34:17}}</ref>\n\nSocial norms pointing to kings further flow from making clear, first-generation survivors so avoidance of [[civil war]]. Lacking advanced healthcare and resource-conscious [[family planning]] [[death in childbirth|mothers faced high risk in enduring such regular childbirth]]. Also in pre-20th century medicine [[female infertility|about 10% of women could not have children]]. Added to this, on any necessary remarriage from death in childbirth. The king would have socially entrenched powers over their new spouse: [[coverture|financial]] and any rivalry of a new queen consort by her personal and companions' physical strength was with in the [[chivalry|chivalric norm]] far-fetched so far as it might present a challenge to her ruling husband, if proving relatively able. Times of turbulence were more likely when a queen regnant/female main heir allowed to inherit was married to or remarried to a similar-status foreign leader, as was conventional for high-status women for their family security and diplomacy. Such a situation was a major source of civil wars; one example is the [[Spanish Armada]]. [[Henry VIII of England]] did not wait until death and remarried twice on the basis of lack of producing a male heir, on the second occasion beheading his queen \"for witchcraft\". A small minority of monarchs in many countries have openly made their heir [[Royal bastard|an illegitimate child]]; stories abound of others as newborns brought to the expectant queen consort such as to [[Charles I of England and Scotland]] \"in a bedpan\".  Under any of these considerations: sons, some of whose lives were in times of war likely to be lost in battle, could be expected to produce more heirs. Eldest daughters could find themselves under a situation of duress on remarriage, and the concept of the trophy bride if the husband were slain is one resonant in many cultures especially before the 20th century.\n\nQueen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] is a descendant of [[Henry I of England|Henry]]'s illegitimate daughter Constance but so too her sister [[Empress Matilda]] (this main line being legitimate) and has two other known illegitimate ancestors.<ref>[http://royalbastards.org/ Descendants of the Illegitimate Sons and Daughters of the Kings of Britain]</ref>\n\n==Arguments in favour==\nPrimogeniture by definition prevents the [[subdivision (land)|subdivision of estates]]. This lessens family pressures to sell property, such as if two (or more) children inherit a house and cannot afford to buy out the other(s). \n\nIn much of Europe younger sons of the nobility had no prospect of inheriting by death any property, and commonly sought careers in the Church, in military service (see [[purchase of commissions in the British Army]]), or in government. Some wills made [[bequest]]s to a [[monastic order]] for an already suitably educated, disinherited son.\n\nMany of the Spanish [[Conquistador]]s were younger sons who had to make their fortune in war. In the late 17th and early 18th centuries, many younger sons of [[England|English]] aristocrats specifically chose to leave England for [[Virginia]] in the Colonies. Many of the early Virginians who were [[plantation]] owners were younger sons of landed gentry who had left Britain and Ireland fortuneless due to primogeniture. These were key ancestors of the [[Founding Fathers]] of the [[United States of America]].\n\nIn Japan, the Imperial chronologies include eight reigning empresses from ancient times up through the Edo period; however, their successors were most often selected from amongst the males of the paternal Imperial bloodline, which is why some conservative scholars argue that the women's reigns were temporary and that male-only succession tradition must be maintained.<ref>[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070327i1.html \"Life in the Cloudy Imperial Fishbowl,\"] ''Japan Times.'' 27 March 2007.</ref> [[Japanese empresses]] such as [[Empress Gensh\u014d]] (680\u2013748), who succeeded her mother the [[Empress Gemmei]] (661\u2013721) on the throne (but only because she was a Princess of the Imperial family, daughter of [[Prince Kusakabe]]), remain the sole exceptions to this conventional argument.\n\n==Arguments against==\n{{Original research section|date=March 2019}}\nThe fact that the eldest son \"scooped the pool\" often led to ill-feeling amongst younger sons (and of course daughters). Through marriage, estates inherited by primogeniture were combined and some nobles achieved wealth and power sufficient to pose a threat even to the crown itself. Finally, nobles tended to complain about and resist rules of primogeniture.\n\nIn ''[[Democracy in America]]'', [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] observes that abolition of primogeniture and [[fee tail|entail]] as to property results in faster division of land.<ref name=dt>{{cite book | last = de Tocqueville | first = Alexis| title = Democracy in America |year = 1835 | chapter = 3-The Social Condition of the Anglo-Americans| ref = | title-link = Democracy in America}}</ref> However primogeniture's forcing landless people to seek wealth outside the family estate to maintain their [[standard of living]] accelerated the death of the landed [[aristocracy]] and, in his view, thus, quickened the shift to [[democracy]].<ref name=dt/>\n\n==Historical examples==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2019}}\nA case of agnatic primogeniture is exemplified in the [[France|French]] royal ''milieu'', where the [[Salic Law|Salic law]] (attributed to the [[Salian]] [[Franks]]) forbade any inheritance of a crown through the female line. This rule was adopted to solve the [[Hundred Years' War|dispute over the legitimate successor]] of [[Charles IV of France]] ([[Edward III of England]] or [[Philip VI of France]], though the former would have a stronger claim should [[proximity of blood]] be considered). Conflict between the Salic law and the less stark, male-preference rule was also the genesis of [[Carlism]] in [[Spain]].\n\nThe crowns of [[Hanover]] and [[Great Britain]] diverged upon the death of [[William IV of the United Kingdom]] in 1837. The king's eldest surviving brother, [[Ernest Augustus I of Hanover|Ernest I]], inherited Hanover, while the [[United Kingdom]] was inherited by his niece, [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]. This was due to the operation of semi-Salic law in Hanover and to male-preference primogeniture in the British Empire.\n\nIn 1890, the divergence of the thrones of Luxembourg and the Netherlands, both ruled by semi-Salic law, was caused by the fact that the Luxembourg line of succession went back more generations than the Dutch one. The Luxembourg succession was ruled by the provisions of the Nassau House Treaty of 1783. Where the succession is concerned, Luxembourg is the successor state to the Principality of (Orange-) Nassau-Dietz. The Dutch succession only went back to King William I (1815\u20131840). Therefore, Luxembourg still had agnatic heirs from another branch of the House of Nassau left to succeed, while in the Netherlands the male line starting with William I was depleted.\n\nSince the Middle Ages, the semi-Salic principle was prevalent for the inheritance of feudal land in the Holy Roman Empire: inheritance was allowed through females when the male line expired. Females themselves did not inherit, but their male issue could. For example, a grandfather without sons was succeeded by his grandson, the son of his daughter, although the daughter still lived. Likewise, an uncle without sons of his own was succeeded by his nephew, a son of his sister, even if the sister still lived.\n\nCommon in feudal Europe outside of Germany was land inheritance based on a form of primogeniture: A [[lord]] was succeeded by his eldest son but, failing sons, either by daughters or sons of daughters. In most medieval Western European feudal fiefs, females (such as daughters and sisters) were allowed to succeed, brothers failing. But usually the husband of the heiress became the real lord, assuming his wife's title with the suffix ''[[jure uxoris]]''.\n\nIn more complex medieval cases, the sometimes conflicting principles of [[proximity of blood]] and primogeniture competed, and outcomes were at times unpredictable. Proximity meant that an heir closer in degree of kinship to the lord in question was given precedence although that heir was not necessarily the heir by primogeniture.\n\n* The [[Philip I of Burgundy|Burgundian succession]] in 1361 was resolved in favor of John, son of a younger daughter, on basis of blood proximity, being a nearer cousin of the dead duke than Charles, grandson of the elder daughter. Proximity sometimes favored younger lines (directly contrary to the outcome from applying primogeniture), since it was more probable that from a younger line, a member of an earlier generation was still alive compared with\u00a0the descendants of the elder line.\n* In dispute over the [[Competitors for the Crown of Scotland|Scottish succession]], 1290\u201391, the [[Bruce]] family pleaded [[tanistry]] and [[proximity of blood]], whereas [[John of Scotland|Balliol]] argued his claim based on primogeniture. The arbiter, [[Edward I of England]], decided in favor of primogeniture. But later, the [[Wars of Scottish Independence|Independence Wars]] reverted the situation in favor of the Bruce, due to political exigency.\n* The [[Earl of Gloucester|Earldom of Gloucester]] (in the beginning of 14th century) went to full sisters of the dead earl, not to his half-sisters, though they were elder, having been born of the father's first marriage, while the earl himself was from second marriage. Full siblings were considered higher in proximity than half-siblings.\n\nHowever, primogeniture increasingly won legal cases over proximity in later centuries.\n\nLater, when lands were strictly divided among noble families and tended to remain fixed, ''agnatic primogeniture'' became usual: succession going to the eldest son of the monarch; if the monarch had no sons, the throne would pass to the nearest male relative in the male line.\n\nSome countries however accepted female rulers early on, so that if the monarch had no sons, the throne would pass to the eldest daughter. For example, Queen [[Christina of Sweden]] succeeded to the throne after the death of her father, King [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustav II Adolf]].\n\nIn England, primogeniture was mandatory for inheritance of land. Until the [[Statute of Wills]] was passed in 1540, a will could \u00a0control only the inheritance of personal property. Real estate (land) passed to the eldest male descendant [[by operation of law]]. The statute added a provision that a landowner could \"devise\" land by the use of a new device called a \"testament\". The rule of primogeniture in England was not changed until the [[Administration of Estates Act]] in 1925.\n\nIn law, the rule of inheritance whereby land descends to the oldest son.{{clarification needed|date=December 2019}} Under the feudal system of medieval Europe, primogeniture generally governed the inheritance of land held in military tenure (see [[knight]]). The effect of this rule was to keep the father's land for the support of the son who rendered the required military service. When feudalism declined and the payment of a tax was substituted for military service, the need for primogeniture disappeared. In England, consequently, there was enacted\u00a0 the Statute of Wills (1540), which permitted the oldest son to be entirely cut off from inheriting, and in the 17th century military tenure was abolished; primogeniture is, nevertheless, still customary in England. In the United States primogeniture never became widely established.\n\n==Semi-Salic law==\n[[File:Agnatic-cognatic primogeniture diagram.svg|thumb|Agnatic-cognatic primogeniture diagram]]\n{{for|a clearer explanation of the differences between Salic, Semi-Salic laws and male-preference primogeniture|Salic law}}\n\nAnother variation on agnatic primogeniture is the so-called semi-Salic law, or \"agnatic-cognatic primogeniture\", which allows women to succeed only at the extinction of all the male descendants in the male line.<ref>Nordisk familjebok, ''Tronf\u00f6ljd'', 1920; SOU 1977:5 ''Kvinnlig tronf\u00f6ljd''.</ref> Such were the cases of [[Bourbon Spain]] until 1833 and the dominions of [[Austria-Hungary]], as well as most realms within the former [[Holy Roman Empire]], i.e. most German monarchies. This was also the law of [[Russia]] under the [[Pauline Laws]] of 1797 and of [[Luxembourg]] until equal primogeniture was introduced on 20 June 2011.\n\nThere are various versions of semi-Salic law also, although in all forms women do not succeed by application of the same kind of primogeniture as was in effect among males in the family. Rather, the female who is nearest in kinship to the last male monarch of the family inherits, even if another female agnate of the dynasty is senior by primogeniture. Among sisters (and the lines of descendants issuing from them), the elder are preferred to the younger. In reckoning [[consanguinity]] or [[proximity of blood]] the dynasty's [[house law]] defines who among female relatives is \"nearest\" to the last male.\n\n===Matrilineal primogeniture===\n{{see also|Matrilineal succession}}\n''Matrilineal primogeniture'', or ''female-preference uterine primogeniture'', is a form of succession practised in some societies in which the eldest female child inherits the throne, to the total exclusion of males. The order of succession to the position of the [[Rain Queen]] is an example in an [[Africa]]n culture of [[matrilineality|matrilineal]] primogeniture: not only is [[dynasty|dynastic]] descent reckoned through the female line, but only females are eligible to inherit.\n\nThe Nair Community of Kerala, India is an example for Matrilineal inheritance and the Kingdom of Travancore is inherited only by the sons of the Queen of Attingal.\n\n==History==\nIn Christian Europe, the [[Catholic Church]] originally had a monopoly on the authority to sanction marriage. Its teachings forbid polygamy and state divorce is an impossibility ''per se''. Consequently, in Europe, given morbidity and infertility succession could not be assured solely by direct male descendants or even direct male or female progeny. In [[Islam]]ic and Asian cultures, religious officials and customs either sanctioned [[polygyny]], use of consorts, or both, or they had no authority of marriage; monarchs could consequently ensure sufficient numbers of male offspring to assure succession. In such cultures, female heads of state were rare.\n\n===Biblical===\n{{Main|Bechor}}\n[[File:Figures Esau Sells His Birthright for Pottage of Lentils.jpg|thumb|alt=Engraving|''Esau Sells His Birthright for Pottage of Lentils'', a 1728 engraving by [[Gerard Hoet]]]]\n\nThe earliest account of primogeniture to be known widely in modern times is that of [[Isaac]]'s sons [[Esau]], who was born first,<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|25:25}}</ref> and [[Jacob]], who was born second.<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|25:26}}</ref> Esau was entitled to the \"birthright\" (''bekhorah'' \u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05db\u05d5\u05b9\u05e8\u05b8\u05d4), but he sold the right to Jacob for a [[mess of pottage]], i. e. a small amount of food.<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|25:31\u201334}}</ref> Although the veracity of this account is not corroborated by other sources, its telling in this passage demonstrates that primogeniture was sufficiently common in the [[Middle East]] for the passage to seem plausible to the people living there prior to the [[Roman Empire]].\n\nIn the Bible a woman's right and obligation to inherit property in the absence of a male heir in the family was established by the [[Daughters of Zelophehad]] in Numbers 27.\n\n===Roman law===\nDuring the [[Roman Empire]], [[Roman law]] governed much of Europe, and the laws pertaining to inheritance made no distinction between the oldest or youngest, male or female, if the decedent died [[Intestacy|intestate]].<ref name=\"www2.hn.psu.edu\">[http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/adamsmith.htm HN.psu.edu] Smith, Adam, (1776), Penn State Electronic Classics edition, republished 2006, p. 312.</ref> Although admission to the two highest ''[[Roman Empire#ordines|ordines]]'' (orders), i. e. the [[Roman Senate|senators]] and [[equestrian order|equestrians]], potentially brought lifelong privileges that the next generation could inherit, the principle of inherited rank in general was little used.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Millar |first1=Fergus |authorlink=Fergus Millar |year=1983 |title=Empire and City, Augustus to Julian: Obligations, Excuses and Status |url= |journal=[[Journal of Roman Studies]] |volume=73 |issue= |pages=87\u201388 |doi=10.2307/300073|jstor=300073 }}</ref> Rather, Roman aristocracy was based on competition, and a Roman family could not maintain its position in the ''ordines'' merely by hereditary succession or title to land.<ref>Hopkins, Keith (2000). \"The Political Economy of the Roman Empire,\" in ''The Dynamics of Ancient Empires: State Power from Assyria to Byzantium'' ([[Oxford University Press]]), p. 188.</ref> Although the eldest son typically carried [[Roman naming conventions|his father's name]] in some form, he was expected to construct his own [[cursus honorum|career]] based on competence as an [[legatus|administrator or general]] and on remaining in favor with the emperor and his council at court.<ref>Hopkins, ''The Political Economy of the Roman Empire,'' p. 188.</ref> Other than meeting requirements for personal wealth, the qualifications for belonging to the senatorial or equestrian orders varied from generation to generation, and in the later Empire, the ''[[Dignitas (Roman concept)|dignitas]]'' (\"esteem\") that attended on senatorial or equestrian rank was refined further with additional titles, such as ''[[vir illustris]],'' that were not inherited.<ref>Millar. \"Empire and City\". p. 90, calls them \"status-appellations\".</ref>\n\nMost [[Roman emperor]]s indicated their choice of successor, usually a close family member or [[Adoption in ancient Rome|adopted]] heir, and the presumption that the eldest or even a natural son would inherit was not enshrined.

He made war according to his own discretion, frequently against his neighbours, and sometimes against his sovereign. The security of a landed estate, therefore, the protection which its owner could afford to those who dwelt on it, depended upon its greatness. To divide it was to ruin it, and to expose every part of it to be oppressed and swallowed up by the incursions of its neighbours.

This dispute was among the factors behind the [[Hundred Years' War]], which broke out in 1337.\n\nConflict between the Salic law and the male-preferred system was also the genesis of [[Carlism]] in Spain and [[Miguelist|Miguelism]] in Portugal.\n\nThe crowns of [[Hanover]] and Great Britain, which had been in [[personal union]] since 1714, were separated in 1837 upon the death of King [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]]: his niece [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]] inherited the British crown under male-preference primogeniture but, because of semi-Salic law, was not the heir to that of Hanover, which passed to William's eldest surviving brother, [[Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover]].\n\nThe divergence in the late 19th century of the thrones of Luxembourg and the Netherlands, both subject to semi-Salic law, resulted from the fact that the Luxembourg line of succession went back more generations than did the Dutch line. The Luxembourg succession was set by the [[Nassau Family Pact|Nassau House Treaty of 1783]], which declared each prince of the [[House of Nassau]] to be a potential heir to the territories of every branch of the dynasty. Insofar as the succession is concerned, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg is the successor state to the Principality of (Orange-)[[Nassau-Dietz]], which was given in exchange to [[William I of the Netherlands|William VI of Nassau, Prince of Orange]], in 1813. Succession to the new Kingdom of the Netherlands was recognised by the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815 as belonging exclusively to the descendants of Prince William VI, who became [[William I of the Netherlands|King William I of the Netherlands]]. In 1890, William I's agnatic line of male descendants died out, leaving the Netherlands to his female descendant [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina]], whereas Luxembourg still had an agnatic heir from a distant branch of the dynasty left to succeed; ex-[[Adolphe, Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Duke Adolf of Nassau]], who became reigning Grand Duke, thus ending the [[personal union]] of the Netherlands and Luxembourg.\n\nSince the Middle Ages, the semi-Salic principle was prevalent for the inheritance of feudal land in the Holy Roman Empire: inheritance was allowed through females when the male line expired.

Carole Shammas argues that issues of primogeniture, dower, curtesy, strict family settlements in equity, collateral kin, and unilateral division of real and personal property were fully developed in the colonial courts. The Americans differed little from English policies regarding the status of widow, widower, and lineal descendants.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Shammas |first1=Carole |year=1987 |title=English inheritance law and its transfer to the colonies |url= |journal=American Journal of Legal History |volume=31 |issue= 2|pages=145\u2013163 |doi=10.2307/845880|jstor=845880 }}</ref>  The primogeniture laws were repealed at the time of the [[American Revolution]].

In some contexts it instead means the inheritance of the firstborn child (absolute primogeniture) or the firstborn daughter (matrilineal primogeniture).\n\nThe first definition given is also known as male-line primogeniture, the classical form popular in European jurisdictions among others until into the 20th century. In the absence of male-line offspring, variations were expounded to entitle a daughter or a brother or, in the absence of either, to another collateral relative, in a specified order (e.g. male-preference primogeniture, Salic primogeniture, semi-Salic primogeniture). Variations have tempered the traditional, sole-beneficiary, right (such as French [[appanage]]) or, in the West since World War II, eliminate the preference for males over females (absolute male-preference primogeniture). Most [[monarchies in Europe|monarchies in Western Europe]] have eliminated this, in succession: [[Monarchy of Belgium|Belgium]], [[Monarchy of Denmark|Denmark]], [[Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Luxembourg]], [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|Netherlands]], [[Monarchy of Norway|Norway]], [[Monarchy of Sweden|Sweden]] and the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]].\n\nEnglish primogeniture endures mainly in titles of nobility: any first-placed direct male-line descendant (e.g. eldest son's son's son) inherits the title before siblings and similar, this being termed \"by right of substitution\" for the deceased heir; secondly where children were only daughters they would enjoy the fettered use (life use) of an equal amount of the underlying real asset and the substantive free use (such as one-half inheritance) would accrue to their most senior-line male descendant or contingent on her marriage ([[Moiety title|moieties]]); thirdly, where the late estate holder had no descendants his oldest brother would succeed, and his descendants would likewise enjoy the rule of substitution where he had died. The effect of English primogeniture was to keep estates undivided wherever possible and to disinherit real property from female relations unless only daughters survived in which case the estate thus normally results in division. The principle has applied in history to inheritance of land as well as inherited titles and offices, most notably monarchies, continuing until modified or abolished.\n\nOther forms of inheritance in monarchies have existed or continue. The [[Holy Roman Emperor]] was selected for enthronement by a small number of powerful [[prince elector]]s from among Europe's Christian males of inherited [[nobility]]. Currently, [[succession to the Saudi Arabian throne]] uses a form of lateral [[agnatic seniority]], as did the [[Kievan Rus']] (see [[Rota system]]), the early [[Kingdom of Scotland]] (see [[Tanistry]]), the [[Mongol Empire]] (see [[Order of succession#Lateral succession|lateral succession]]) or the later [[Ottoman Empire]] (see [[Line of succession to the former Ottoman throne#Succession practices|succession practices]]).\n\nResearch shows that authoritarian regimes that rely on primogeniture for succession were more stable than forms of authoritarian rule with alternative succession arrangements.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kurrild-Klitgaard|first=Peter|date=2000|title=The constitutional economics of autocratic succession|journal=Public Choice|volume=103|issue=1/2|pages=63\u201384|doi=10.1023/A:1005078532251|issn=0048-5829}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kurrild-Klitgaard|first=Peter|date=2004|title=Autocratic succession|journal=Encyclopedia of Public Choice|volume=103|pages=358\u2013362|doi=10.1007/978-0-306-47828-4_39|isbn=978-0-306-47828-4}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kokkonen|first=Andrej|last2=Sundell|first2=Anders|date=May 2014|title=Delivering Stability\u2014Primogeniture and Autocratic Survival in European Monarchies 1000\u20131800|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=108|issue=2|pages=438\u2013453|doi=10.1017/S000305541400015X|issn=0003-0554}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Acharya|first=Avidit|last2=Lee|first2=Alexander|date=2019-11-01|title=Path Dependence in European Development: Medieval Politics, Conflict, and State Building|journal=Comparative Political Studies|volume=52|issue=13\u201314|pages=2171\u20132206|doi=10.1177/0010414019830716|issn=0010-4140|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ec8206be437f5963855144ee401a2d2336fbe9ad}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kokkonen|first=Andrej|last2=Sundell|first2=Anders|date=2019-06-11|title=Leader Succession and Civil War|journal=Comparative Political Studies|pages=0010414019852712|doi=10.1177/0010414019852712|issn=0010-4140}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/tracking-the-arab-spring-why-the-modest-harvest/|title=Tracking the \"Arab Spring\": Why the Modest Harvest?|website=Journal of Democracy|access-date=2019-10-27}}</ref>\n\n==Order of succession in monarchies today==\n[[File:Order of succession (Primogeniture) in the monarchies of the World.png|thumb|[[World]] [[Monarchy|monarchies]] by succession:\n{{legend|#880015|[[Absolute primogeniture]]}}\n{{legend|#A349A4|[[Elective monarchy|Elective]] and [[agnatic primogeniture]]}}\n{{legend|#22B14C|[[Agnatic primogeniture]]}}\n{{legend|#FF7F27|[[Elective monarchy|Elective]]}}\n{{legend|#3F48CC|[[Male primogeniture|Male-preference primogeniture]]}}\n{{legend|red|[[Agnatic seniority]]}}]]\n[[File:Order of succession (Primogeniture) in European monarchies.png|thumb|[[Monarchies in Europe|European monarchies]] by succession:\n{{legend|#A52A2A|Absolute primogeniture}}\n{{legend|green|Agnatic primogeniture}}\n{{legend|#FF7E00|[[Elective monarchy|Elective]]}}\n{{legend|#0048BA|Male-preference primogeniture}}]]\n{{anchor|Absolute cognatic primogeniture}}\n[[File:Order of succession (Primogeniture) in African monarchies.png|thumb|[[Monarchies in Africa|African monarchies]] by succession:\n{{legend|green|Agnatic primogeniture}}\n{{legend|#FF7E00|[[Elective monarchy|Elective]]}}\n{{legend|#0048BA|Male-preference primogeniture}}]]\n[[File:Order of succession (Primogeniture) in Southeast Asia monarchies.png|thumb|[[Monarchies in Asia|Southeast Asian monarchies]] by succession:\n{{legend|#89000D|Absolute primogeniture}}\n{{legend|#A447A5|[[Elective monarchy|Elective]] and Agnatic primogeniture}}\n{{legend|#1CB34B|Agnatic primogeniture}}\n{{legend|#FF8022|[[Elective monarchy|Elective]]}}\n{{legend|#0000FF|Male-preference primogeniture}}]]\n[[File:Order of succession (Primogeniture) in Middle Eastern monarchies.png|thumb|[[Monarchies in Asia|Middle Eastern monarchies]] by succession:\n{{legend|#A52A2A|Absolute primogeniture}}\n{{legend|#800080|[[Elective monarchy|Elective]] and Agnatic primogeniture}}\n{{legend|green|Agnatic primogeniture}}\n{{legend|#FF7E00|[[Agnatic seniority]]}}\n{{legend|#0000FF|Male-preference primogeniture}}]]\n\n===Absolute primogeniture===\n[[File:Absolute cognatic primogeniture diagram.svg|thumb|Absolute cognatic primogeniture diagram]]\n<!-- This section is forward referenced and linked from [[Westeros]] and [[Hundred Years' War]]. -->\n''Absolute'', ''equal'', or ''lineal primogeniture'' is a form of primogeniture in which gender is irrelevant for inheritance.

Eventually only the Basque lower nobility and free families of the Basque country and other regions continued to follow this custom, which persisted as late as the 19th century.<ref name=\"a\u00eenesse int\u00e9grale\" />\n\nAn ancient and alternative way in which women succeeded to power, especially without displacing the direct male line descendants of the first monarchs, was consortium or [[coregency]] between husband and wife or other relatives. The most notable are the Egyptian cases of [[Hatshepsut]] and [[Thutmose III]], and the monarchs of the [[Ptolemaic Dynasty]].\n\nIn 1980, [[Sweden]] amended its [[constitution]] to adopt royal succession by absolute primogeniture, displacing King [[Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden|Carl XVI Gustaf]]'s infant son, [[Prince Carl Philip]], in favor of his elder daughter, [[Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden|Princess Victoria]], in the process. Several monarchies have since followed suit: the [[Netherlands]] in 1983, [[Norway]] in 1990, [[Belgium]] in 1991, [[Denmark]] in 2009, [[Luxembourg]] in 2011, and the [[Commonwealth realms]] in 2015.\n\n[[Monaco]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Norway]] also deviated from traditional primogeniture in the late 20th or early 21st century by restricting succession to the crown to relatives within a specified degree of [[kinship]] to the most recent monarch.\n\nRecently, other monarchies have changed or considered changing to absolute primogeniture:\n\n* With the birth of [[Infanta Leonor of Spain]] on 31 October 2005 to the then heir apparent [[Felipe VI of Spain|Felipe, Prince of Asturias]], and [[Queen Letizia of Spain|Princess Letizia]], the Spanish Prime Minister [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero]] reaffirmed the intention of the government to institute, by amendment of the Spanish constitution, absolute primogeniture. Zapatero's proposal was supported by the leader of the main opposition party, the conservative ''[[People's Party (Spain)|Partido Popular]]'', making its passage probable. However, Zapatero's administration ended before an amendment was drafted, and the succeeding government has not pursued it. The Prince counseled reformers that there was plenty of time before any constitutional amendment would need to be enacted because the expectation was to leave him next in line to succeed his father despite his elder sisters' continued status as [[dynasty#Dynasts|dynasts]]; equal primogeniture was expected to apply first to his children. Felipe succeeded to the throne as Felipe VI upon his father's abdication in 2014, by which time he had two daughters. Felipe VI has no son that would, absent the constitutional amendment, displace Leonor as heir apparent.\n* In July 2006, the [[Nepal]]ese government proposed adopting absolute primogeniture,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newkerala.com/news3.php?action=fullnews&id=31256 |title=New Kerala}}</ref> but the monarchy was abolished in 2008 before the change could be effected.\n* In 2011, the governments of the 16 [[Commonwealth realm]]s which have a common monarch announced the [[Perth Agreement]], a plan to legislate changes to absolute primogeniture.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Watt |first=Nicholas |date=28 October 2011 |accessdate=28 October 2011 |title=Royal equality act will end succession of firstborn male \u2013 rather than older sister |work=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/oct/28/commonwealth-royalty-succession-change}}</ref> This was implemented when the necessary legislation came into effect on 26 March 2015.\n* In [[Japan]], it has been debated whether or not to adopt absolute primogeniture, as [[Princess Aiko]] is the only child of [[Naruhito|Emperor Naruhito]]. However, the birth in 2006 of [[Prince Hisahito of Akishino|Prince Hisahito]], a son of [[Prince Akishino]] (the younger brother of Naruhito, and next in line to the [[Chrysanthemum Throne]]) has suspended the debate.\n\n===Agnatic primogeniture===\n[[File:Agnatic primogeniture diagram.svg|thumb|Agnatic primogeniture diagram]]\nUnder agnatic primogeniture, or patrilineal primogeniture, the degree of kinship (of males and females) is determined by tracing shared descent from the nearest common ancestor through male ancestors.<ref name=\"Murphy\">{{Cite web |last=Murphy |first=Michael Dean |title=A Kinship Glossary: Symbols, Terms, and Concepts |url=http://www.as.ua.edu/ant/Faculty/murphy/436/kinship.htm |accessdate=5 October 2006}}</ref> Those who share agnatic kinship (through solely male ancestors) are termed \"agnates\"; those whose shared lineage includes a female ancestor are \"cognates\".\n\nThere were different types of succession based on agnatic primogeniture, all sharing the principle that inheritance is according to seniority of birth among siblings (compare to [[ultimogeniture]]) and seniority of lineage among the agnatic kin, firstly, among the sons of a monarch or [[paterfamilias|head of family]], with sons and their male-line issue inheriting before brothers and their issue. Females and female-line descendants are excluded from succession.\n\n===Male-preference primogeniture===\n[[File:Male-preference primogeniture diagram.svg|thumb|Male-preference primogeniture diagram]]\nMale-preference primogeniture accords succession to the throne to a female member of a [[dynasty]] if and only if she has no living brothers and no deceased brothers who left surviving legitimate descendants. A [[Dynasty#Dynasts|dynast]]'s sons and their lines of descent all come before that dynast's daughters and their lines. Older sons and their lines come before younger sons and their lines. Older daughters and their lines come before younger daughters and their lines.\n\nIt was practised in the succession to the once-separate thrones of [[England]] and [[Scotland]] (until their union under [[James VI and I]]) and then the [[United Kingdom]] until 2015, when the [[Succession to the Crown Act 2013]] changed it to absolute primogeniture. The rule change also applies to all [[Commonwealth realm]]s that have the British monarch as their head of state.\n\nMale-preference primogeniture is currently practised in succession to the thrones of [[Monaco]] and [[Spain]] (before 1700 and since [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1830|1830]]).\n\nWith respect to [[hereditary title]]s, it is usually the rule for Scotland and [[Hereditary peer#Writs of summons|baronies by writ]] in the United Kingdom, but baronies by writ go into [[abeyance]] when the last male titleholder dies leaving more than one surviving sister or more than one descendant in the legitimate female line of the original titleholder.\n\n==Salic law==\nAn [[agnatic seniority]] primogeniture system that excludes any female from inheritance of a monarch's principal possessions is generally known in western Europe as an application of the \"[[Salic law]]\" (see ''[[Terra salica]]''). This rule developed among successions in France in the later Middle Ages. In 1316, [[Joan II of Navarre|Joan]], the only surviving child of [[Louis X of France]], was debarred from the throne in favor of her uncle, [[Philip V of France|Philip, Count of Poitiers]]. After this it was declared that women could not inherit the French throne. Then in 1328, after the death of [[Charles IV of France|Charles IV]], [[Philip VI of France|Philip, Count of Valois]] (Charles IV's paternal cousin), became king, notwithstanding the claims of [[Edward III of England]]. By [[proximity of blood]], Edward was closest related as eldest son of the sister of Charles, [[Isabella of France|Isabella]]. The assemblies of the French barons and prelates and the University of Paris resolved that males who derive their right to inheritance through their mother should be excluded.  This ruling became a key point of contention in the subsequent [[Hundred Years War]]. Over the following century, French jurists adopted a clause from the 6th century ''[[Salic law|Pactus Legis Salicae]]'', which asserted that no female or her descendants could inherit the throne, as a governing rule for the French succession.\n\nIn the lands of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s conquests, Salic law was adopted, including the [[First French Empire|French Empire]], the [[Kingdom of Westphalia]], the [[Kingdom of Holland]] and, under Napoleonic influence, the [[House of Bernadotte]]'s Sweden. Other states adopted Salic primogeniture as well, including Belgium, Denmark ([[Frederick VII of Denmark#Succession crisis|in 1853]]) and all of the eastern European monarchies except Greece, i.e. [[Albanian Kingdom (1928\u201339)|Albania]],  [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Principality of Montenegro|Montenegro]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], and [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]]. During this era, Spain (in the [[Carlist Wars|Carlist conflicts]]) fought a [[civil war]] which pitted the Salic and female-line heirs of the ruling dynasty against one another for possession of the crown.\n\nA variation of Salic primogeniture allowed the sons of women to inherit, but not women themselves, an example being the [[Francisco Franco|Francoist]] succession to the throne of Spain that was applied in 1947&ndash;1978.\n\n;British and French titles of nobility\n\nMany descend by salic, male primogeniture so have a greater average rate of extinction. Many others if the title is otherwise to be extinct pass to the closest elder sister or a line of descendants to the last holder, as abeyant holders, such being parents or ancestors to whichever direct male descendant is first born to 'settle the abeyance'. Some senior agnatic [[cadet (genealogy)|cadets]] are granted from the outset [[courtesy titles|courtesy]] or [[subsidiary title|subsidiary]] titles. Notable English exceptions are the [[Duchy of Lancaster]], which is merged with the [[British Crown]] which has included women in inheritance since the 16th century, and the [[Duke of Marlborough (title)|Dukedom of Marlborough]], which has done so since its establishment in 1702.\n\n==Preference for males==\n{{See also|Death in childbirth|female infertility|coverture|civil war}}\nThe preference for males existing in most systems of primogeniture (and in other mechanisms of hereditary succession) comes mostly from the perceived nature of the tasks and role of the monarch: a monarch/[[prince]] (the latter means in latin chieftain) most usually was, first and foremost, a military leader, as in the millennia-old [[Book of Numbers]].<ref>\"you: Eleazor the Priest and Joshua son of Nun. And you shall also take a chieftain from each tribe through whom the land shall be apportioned. These are the names of the men...{{Bibleverse|Numbers|34:17}}</ref>\n\nSocial norms pointing to kings further flow from making clear, first-generation survivors so avoidance of [[civil war]]. Lacking advanced healthcare and resource-conscious [[family planning]] [[death in childbirth|mothers faced high risk in enduring such regular childbirth]]. Also in pre-20th century medicine [[female infertility|about 10% of women could not have children]]. Added to this, on any necessary remarriage from death in childbirth. The king would have socially entrenched powers over their new spouse: [[coverture|financial]] and any rivalry of a new queen consort by her personal and companions' physical strength was with in the [[chivalry|chivalric norm]] far-fetched so far as it might present a challenge to her ruling husband, if proving relatively able. Times of turbulence were more likely when a queen regnant/female main heir allowed to inherit was married to or remarried to a similar-status foreign leader, as was conventional for high-status women for their family security and diplomacy. Such a situation was a major source of civil wars; one example is the [[Spanish Armada]]. [[Henry VIII of England]] did not wait until death and remarried twice on the basis of lack of producing a male heir, on the second occasion beheading his queen \"for witchcraft\". A small minority of monarchs in many countries have openly made their heir [[Royal bastard|an illegitimate child]]; stories abound of others as newborns brought to the expectant queen consort such as to [[Charles I of England and Scotland]] \"in a bedpan\".  Under any of these considerations: sons, some of whose lives were in times of war likely to be lost in battle, could be expected to produce more heirs. Eldest daughters could find themselves under a situation of duress on remarriage, and the concept of the trophy bride if the husband were slain is one resonant in many cultures especially before the 20th century.\n\nQueen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] is a descendant of [[Henry I of England|Henry]]'s illegitimate daughter Constance but so too her sister [[Empress Matilda]] (this main line being legitimate) and has two other known illegitimate ancestors.<ref>[http://royalbastards.org/ Descendants of the Illegitimate Sons and Daughters of the Kings of Britain]</ref>\n\n==Arguments in favour==\nPrimogeniture by definition prevents the [[subdivision (land)|subdivision of estates]]. This lessens family pressures to sell property, such as if two (or more) children inherit a house and cannot afford to buy out the other(s). \n\nIn much of Europe younger sons of the nobility had no prospect of inheriting by death any property, and commonly sought careers in the Church, in military service (see [[purchase of commissions in the British Army]]), or in government. Some wills made [[bequest]]s to a [[monastic order]] for an already suitably educated, disinherited son.\n\nMany of the Spanish [[Conquistador]]s were younger sons who had to make their fortune in war. In the late 17th and early 18th centuries, many younger sons of [[England|English]] aristocrats specifically chose to leave England for [[Virginia]] in the Colonies. Many of the early Virginians who were [[plantation]] owners were younger sons of landed gentry who had left Britain and Ireland fortuneless due to primogeniture. These were key ancestors of the [[Founding Fathers]] of the [[United States of America]].\n\nIn Japan, the Imperial chronologies include eight reigning empresses from ancient times up through the Edo period; however, their successors were most often selected from amongst the males of the paternal Imperial bloodline, which is why some conservative scholars argue that the women's reigns were temporary and that male-only succession tradition must be maintained.<ref>[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070327i1.html \"Life in the Cloudy Imperial Fishbowl,\"] ''Japan Times.'' 27 March 2007.</ref> [[Japanese empresses]] such as [[Empress Gensh\u014d]] (680\u2013748), who succeeded her mother the [[Empress Gemmei]] (661\u2013721) on the throne (but only because she was a Princess of the Imperial family, daughter of [[Prince Kusakabe]]), remain the sole exceptions to this conventional argument.\n\n==Arguments against==\n{{Original research section|date=March 2019}}\nThe fact that the eldest son \"scooped the pool\" often led to ill-feeling amongst younger sons (and of course daughters). Through marriage, estates inherited by primogeniture were combined and some nobles achieved wealth and power sufficient to pose a threat even to the crown itself. Finally, nobles tended to complain about and resist rules of primogeniture.\n\nIn ''[[Democracy in America]]'', [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] observes that abolition of primogeniture and [[fee tail|entail]] as to property results in faster division of land.<ref name=dt>{{cite book | last = de Tocqueville | first = Alexis| title = Democracy in America |year = 1835 | chapter = 3-The Social Condition of the Anglo-Americans| ref = | title-link = Democracy in America}}</ref> However primogeniture's forcing landless people to seek wealth outside the family estate to maintain their [[standard of living]] accelerated the death of the landed [[aristocracy]] and, in his view, thus, quickened the shift to [[democracy]].<ref name=dt/>\n\n==Historical examples==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2019}}\nA case of agnatic primogeniture is exemplified in the [[France|French]] royal ''milieu'', where the [[Salic Law|Salic law]] (attributed to the [[Salian]] [[Franks]]) forbade any inheritance of a crown through the female line. This rule was adopted to solve the [[Hundred Years' War|dispute over the legitimate successor]] of [[Charles IV of France]] ([[Edward III of England]] or [[Philip VI of France]], though the former would have a stronger claim should [[proximity of blood]] be considered). Conflict between the Salic law and the less stark, male-preference rule was also the genesis of [[Carlism]] in [[Spain]].\n\nThe crowns of [[Hanover]] and [[Great Britain]] diverged upon the death of [[William IV of the United Kingdom]] in 1837. The king's eldest surviving brother, [[Ernest Augustus I of Hanover|Ernest I]], inherited Hanover, while the [[United Kingdom]] was inherited by his niece, [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]. This was due to the operation of semi-Salic law in Hanover and to male-preference primogeniture in the British Empire.\n\nIn 1890, the divergence of the thrones of Luxembourg and the Netherlands, both ruled by semi-Salic law, was caused by the fact that the Luxembourg line of succession went back more generations than the Dutch one. The Luxembourg succession was ruled by the provisions of the Nassau House Treaty of 1783. Where the succession is concerned, Luxembourg is the successor state to the Principality of (Orange-) Nassau-Dietz. The Dutch succession only went back to King William I (1815\u20131840). Therefore, Luxembourg still had agnatic heirs from another branch of the House of Nassau left to succeed, while in the Netherlands the male line starting with William I was depleted.\n\nSince the Middle Ages, the semi-Salic principle was prevalent for the inheritance of feudal land in the Holy Roman Empire: inheritance was allowed through females when the male line expired. Females themselves did not inherit, but their male issue could. For example, a grandfather without sons was succeeded by his grandson, the son of his daughter, although the daughter still lived. Likewise, an uncle without sons of his own was succeeded by his nephew, a son of his sister, even if the sister still lived.\n\nCommon in feudal Europe outside of Germany was land inheritance based on a form of primogeniture: A [[lord]] was succeeded by his eldest son but, failing sons, either by daughters or sons of daughters. In most medieval Western European feudal fiefs, females (such as daughters and sisters) were allowed to succeed, brothers failing. But usually the husband of the heiress became the real lord, assuming his wife's title with the suffix ''[[jure uxoris]]''.\n\nIn more complex medieval cases, the sometimes conflicting principles of [[proximity of blood]] and primogeniture competed, and outcomes were at times unpredictable. Proximity meant that an heir closer in degree of kinship to the lord in question was given precedence although that heir was not necessarily the heir by primogeniture.\n\n* The [[Philip I of Burgundy|Burgundian succession]] in 1361 was resolved in favor of John, son of a younger daughter, on basis of blood proximity, being a nearer cousin of the dead duke than Charles, grandson of the elder daughter. Proximity sometimes favored younger lines (directly contrary to the outcome from applying primogeniture), since it was more probable that from a younger line, a member of an earlier generation was still alive compared with\u00a0the descendants of the elder line.\n* In dispute over the [[Competitors for the Crown of Scotland|Scottish succession]], 1290\u201391, the [[Bruce]] family pleaded [[tanistry]] and [[proximity of blood]], whereas [[John of Scotland|Balliol]] argued his claim based on primogeniture. The arbiter, [[Edward I of England]], decided in favor of primogeniture. But later, the [[Wars of Scottish Independence|Independence Wars]] reverted the situation in favor of the Bruce, due to political exigency.\n* The [[Earl of Gloucester|Earldom of Gloucester]] (in the beginning of 14th century) went to full sisters of the dead earl, not to his half-sisters, though they were elder, having been born of the father's first marriage, while the earl himself was from second marriage. Full siblings were considered higher in proximity than half-siblings.\n\nHowever, primogeniture increasingly won legal cases over proximity in later centuries.\n\nLater, when lands were strictly divided among noble families and tended to remain fixed, ''agnatic primogeniture'' became usual: succession going to the eldest son of the monarch; if the monarch had no sons, the throne would pass to the nearest male relative in the male line.\n\nSome countries however accepted female rulers early on, so that if the monarch had no sons, the throne would pass to the eldest daughter. For example, Queen [[Christina of Sweden]] succeeded to the throne after the death of her father, King [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustav II Adolf]].\n\nIn England, primogeniture was mandatory for inheritance of land. Until the [[Statute of Wills]] was passed in 1540, a will could \u00a0control only the inheritance of personal property. Real estate (land) passed to the eldest male descendant [[by operation of law]]. The statute added a provision that a landowner could \"devise\" land by the use of a new device called a \"testament\". The rule of primogeniture in England was not changed until the [[Administration of Estates Act]] in 1925.\n\nIn law, the rule of inheritance whereby land descends to the oldest son.{{clarification needed|date=December 2019}} Under the feudal system of medieval Europe, primogeniture generally governed the inheritance of land held in military tenure (see [[knight]]). The effect of this rule was to keep the father's land for the support of the son who rendered the required military service. When feudalism declined and the payment of a tax was substituted for military service, the need for primogeniture disappeared. In England, consequently, there was enacted\u00a0 the Statute of Wills (1540), which permitted the oldest son to be entirely cut off from inheriting, and in the 17th century military tenure was abolished; primogeniture is, nevertheless, still customary in England. In the United States primogeniture never became widely established.\n\n==Semi-Salic law==\n[[File:Agnatic-cognatic primogeniture diagram.svg|thumb|Agnatic-cognatic primogeniture diagram]]\n{{for|a clearer explanation of the differences between Salic, Semi-Salic laws and male-preference primogeniture|Salic law}}\n\nAnother variation on agnatic primogeniture is the so-called semi-Salic law, or \"agnatic-cognatic primogeniture\", which allows women to succeed only at the extinction of all the male descendants in the male line.<ref>Nordisk familjebok, ''Tronf\u00f6ljd'', 1920; SOU 1977:5 ''Kvinnlig tronf\u00f6ljd''.</ref> Such were the cases of [[Bourbon Spain]] until 1833 and the dominions of [[Austria-Hungary]], as well as most realms within the former [[Holy Roman Empire]], i.e. most German monarchies. This was also the law of [[Russia]] under the [[Pauline Laws]] of 1797 and of [[Luxembourg]] until equal primogeniture was introduced on 20 June 2011.\n\nThere are various versions of semi-Salic law also, although in all forms women do not succeed by application of the same kind of primogeniture as was in effect among males in the family. Rather, the female who is nearest in kinship to the last male monarch of the family inherits, even if another female agnate of the dynasty is senior by primogeniture. Among sisters (and the lines of descendants issuing from them), the elder are preferred to the younger. In reckoning [[consanguinity]] or [[proximity of blood]] the dynasty's [[house law]] defines who among female relatives is \"nearest\" to the last male.\n\n===Matrilineal primogeniture===\n{{see also|Matrilineal succession}}\n''Matrilineal primogeniture'', or ''female-preference uterine primogeniture'', is a form of succession practised in some societies in which the eldest female child inherits the throne, to the total exclusion of males. The order of succession to the position of the [[Rain Queen]] is an example in an [[Africa]]n culture of [[matrilineality|matrilineal]] primogeniture: not only is [[dynasty|dynastic]] descent reckoned through the female line, but only females are eligible to inherit.\n\nThe Nair Community of Kerala,India is an example for Matrilineal inheritance and the Kingdom of Travancore is inherited only by the sons of the Queen of Attingal.\n\n==History==\nIn Christian Europe, the [[Catholic Church]] originally had a monopoly on the authority to sanction marriage. Its teachings forbid polygamy and state divorce is an impossibility ''per se''. Consequently, in Europe, given morbidity and infertility succession could not be assured solely by direct male descendants or even direct male or female progeny. In [[Islam]]ic and Asian cultures, religious officials and customs either sanctioned [[polygyny]], use of consorts, or both, or they had no authority of marriage; monarchs could consequently ensure sufficient numbers of male offspring to assure succession. In such cultures, female heads of state were rare.\n\n===Biblical===\n{{Main|Bechor}}\n[[File:Figures Esau Sells His Birthright for Pottage of Lentils.jpg|thumb|alt=Engraving|''Esau Sells His Birthright for Pottage of Lentils'', a 1728 engraving by [[Gerard Hoet]]]]\n\nThe earliest account of primogeniture to be known widely in modern times is that of [[Isaac]]'s sons [[Esau]], who was born first,<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|25:25}}</ref> and [[Jacob]], who was born second.<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|25:26}}</ref> Esau was entitled to the \"birthright\" (''bekhorah'' \u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05db\u05d5\u05b9\u05e8\u05b8\u05d4), but he sold the right to Jacob for a [[mess of pottage]], i. e. a small amount of food.<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|25:31\u201334}}</ref> Although the veracity of this account is not corroborated by other sources, its telling in this passage demonstrates that primogeniture was sufficiently common in the [[Middle East]] for the passage to seem plausible to the people living there prior to the [[Roman Empire]].\n\nIn the Bible a woman's right and obligation to inherit property in the absence of a male heir in the family was established by the [[Daughters of Zelophehad]] in Numbers 27.\n\n===Roman law===\nDuring the [[Roman Empire]], [[Roman law]] governed much of Europe, and the laws pertaining to inheritance made no distinction between the oldest or youngest, male or female, if the decedent died [[Intestacy|intestate]].<ref name=\"www2.hn.psu.edu\">[http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/adamsmith.htm HN.psu.edu] Smith, Adam, (1776), Penn State Electronic Classics edition, republished 2006, p. 312.</ref> Although admission to the two highest ''[[Roman Empire#ordines|ordines]]'' (orders), i. e. the [[Roman Senate|senators]] and [[equestrian order|equestrians]], potentially brought lifelong privileges that the next generation could inherit, the principle of inherited rank in general was little used.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Millar |first1=Fergus |authorlink=Fergus Millar |year=1983 |title=Empire and City, Augustus to Julian: Obligations, Excuses and Status |url= |journal=[[Journal of Roman Studies]] |volume=73 |issue= |pages=87\u201388 |doi=10.2307/300073|jstor=300073 }}</ref> Rather, Roman aristocracy was based on competition, and a Roman family could not maintain its position in the ''ordines'' merely by hereditary succession or title to land.<ref>Hopkins, Keith (2000). \"The Political Economy of the Roman Empire,\" in ''The Dynamics of Ancient Empires: State Power from Assyria to Byzantium'' ([[Oxford University Press]]), p. 188.</ref> Although the eldest son typically carried [[Roman naming conventions|his father's name]] in some form, he was expected to construct his own [[cursus honorum|career]] based on competence as an [[legatus|administrator or general]] and on remaining in favor with the emperor and his council at court.<ref>Hopkins, ''The Political Economy of the Roman Empire,'' p. 188.</ref> Other than meeting requirements for personal wealth, the qualifications for belonging to the senatorial or equestrian orders varied from generation to generation, and in the later Empire, the ''[[Dignitas (Roman concept)|dignitas]]'' (\"esteem\") that attended on senatorial or equestrian rank was refined further with additional titles, such as ''[[vir illustris]],'' that were not inherited.<ref>Millar. \"Empire and City\". p. 90, calls them \"status-appellations\".</ref>\n\nMost [[Roman emperor]]s indicated their choice of successor, usually a close family member or [[Adoption in ancient Rome|adopted]] heir, and the presumption that the eldest or even a natural son would inherit was not enshrined.

In those disorderly times, every great landlord was a sort of petty prince. His tenants were his subjects. He was their judge, and in some respects their legislator in peace and their leader in war. He made war according to his own discretion, frequently against his neighbours, and sometimes against his sovereign. The security of a landed estate, therefore, the protection which its owner could afford to those who dwelt on it, depended upon its greatness. To divide it was to ruin it, and to expose every part of it to be oppressed and swallowed up by the incursions of its neighbours. The law of primogeniture, therefore, came to take place, not immediately indeed, but in process of time, in the succession of landed estates, for the same reason that it has generally taken place in that of monarchies, though not always at their first institution.''<ref>[http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/adamsmith.htm HN.psu.edu] Smith, Adam (1776), Penn State Electronic Classics edition, republished 2005, pp. 312\u2013313.</ref>}}\n\n===Historical examples===\nA case of agnatic primogeniture is exemplified in the [[France|French]] royal ''milieu'', where the [[Salic Law]] (attributed to the [[Salian Franks]]) forbade any inheritance of a crown through the female line.

This dispute was among the factors behind the [[Hundred Years' War]], which broke out in 1337.\n\nConflict between the Salic law and the male-preferred system was also the genesis of [[Carlism]] in Spain and [[Miguelist|Miguelism]] in Portugal.\n\nThe crowns of [[Hanover]] and Great Britain, which had been in [[personal union]] since 1714, were separated in 1837 upon the death of King [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]]: his niece [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]] inherited the British crown under male-preference primogeniture but, because of semi-Salic law, was not the heir to that of Hanover, which passed to William's eldest surviving brother, [[Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover]].\n\nThe divergence in the late 19th century of the thrones of Luxembourg and the Netherlands, both subject to semi-Salic law, resulted from the fact that the Luxembourg line of succession went back more generations than did the Dutch line. The Luxembourg succession was set by the [[Nassau Family Pact|Nassau House Treaty of 1783]], which declared each prince of the [[House of Nassau]] to be a potential heir to the territories of every branch of the dynasty. Insofar as the succession is concerned, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg is the successor state to the Principality of (Orange-)[[Nassau-Dietz]], which was given in exchange to [[William I of the Netherlands|William VI of Nassau, Prince of Orange]], in 1813. Succession to the new Kingdom of the Netherlands was recognised by the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815 as belonging exclusively to the descendants of Prince William VI, who became [[William I of the Netherlands|King William I of the Netherlands]]. In 1890, William I's agnatic line of male descendants died out, leaving the Netherlands to his female descendant [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina]], whereas Luxembourg still had an agnatic heir from a distant branch of the dynasty left to succeed; ex-[[Adolphe, Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Duke Adolf of Nassau]], who became reigning Grand Duke, thus ending the [[personal union]] of the Netherlands and Luxembourg.\n\nSince the Middle Ages, the semi-Salic principle was prevalent for the inheritance of feudal land in the Holy Roman Empire: inheritance was allowed through females when the male line expired.

wargame]]s.\n\nThe company was founded by strategy game enthusiasts Ian Trout and [[Roger Keating]].<ref name=\"Chatter2014\">{{cite journal |last1=Chatteur |first1=Fiona |title=Computer Graphics Through the Screen of Strategic Studies Group |journal=Born Digital and Cultural Heritage Conference |date=2014 |page=page 1 }}</ref> Ian was proprietor of a military books store and Roger had had several of his games published by [[Strategic Simulations Inc]]. The game that launched the company was [[Reach for the Stars (computer game)|''Reach for the Stars'']] (1983). This games is credited for having \"effectively launched the genre of 4-X space games - explore, expand, exploit, exterminate\". Its success was followed by a string of other, mostly historical military games published throughout the 1980s for [[Apple II]], [[Atari]], [[Commodore 64]], and [[IBM PC]] series of computers.\n\nTitles included ''[[Reach for the Stars (video game)|Reach for the Stars]]'', ''[[Battlefront (1986 video game)|Battlefront]],'' ''Battles in Normandy,'' ''[[Halls of Montezuma: A Battle History of the U.S. Marine Corps|Halls of Montezuma]]'', ''Europe Ablaze,'' ''MacArthur's War,'' ''[[Carriers at War]],'' (in three volumes), ''Rommel,'' ''Gold of the Americas,'' and ''Decisive Battles of the American Civil War'' (in three volumes, with the first being ''[[Decisive Battles of the American Civil War Volume 1: Bull Run to Chancellorsville|Bull Run to Chancellorsville]]'').  Several of these titles were also released for 16-bit platforms including the [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], [[Apple IIGS]] and [[Macintosh]] during the late 1980s.\n\nFrom the outset SSG titles were characterised by a challenging level of intelligence ([[artificial intelligence|AI]]) in the computer opponents provided in the games. Many of the games included scenario editors. For a time SSG published a tie-in magazine, ''Run 5'', that included articles on historical background to the games, game design, game play and data for setting up new or variant scenarios. Subscribers received a disk with the scenario files already created. Published mostly quarterly it ran for 25 issues.\n\nIn 1989 SSG published ''[[Fire King (video game)|Fire King]]'' an action role-playing game developed by [[Micro Forte]], another Australian games developer.\n\nSSG also produced the ''[[Warlords (game series)|Warlords]]'' series of fantasy turn-based games.  In a mutually friendly decision in 2003, ''Warlords'' designer [[Steve Fawkner]] broke away from Strategic Studies Group and started [[Infinite Interactive]] to publish further ''Warlords'' games.\n\nCo-founder Ian Trout died of cancer on 3 August 2011, which left Roger Keating as CEO of the company.\n\nOn 19 and 20 June 2014 Roger Keating and Gregor Whiley of SSG attended the Born Digital and Cultural Heritage Conference in Melbourne.

Students are driven through diverse activities for developing the \u00a0key competencies consisting of critical thinking, problem-solving, communication, collaboration, curiosity and language of science. Each track facilitates different competitions bi-annually, wherein the students compete for several prizes and competitions. The competing candidates are evaluated by a selected panel of judges from different scientific, business, and industrial organizations.\n\n=== I am a Researcher ===\nI am a Researcher track is one of Al-Bairaq tracks that offers a unique opportunity for grade 12 students to be involved in the research field. Through this track students work as research assistants with faculty professors in the specialized labs of the Center for advanced materials (CAM) in Qatar University. The laboratory experience gained by students through this track increments their understanding about [[Material science]], develops their research self-efficacy, leading to career choices in science and engineering. The goals of this track are accomplished by subjecting the students in a systematic process of inquiry-driven research environment designed through a curriculum of STEM related contemporary real-life research projects.Students therefore acquire learning outcomes that include generating a hypothesis, developing a plan for gathering data, and constructing evidence based on data consequently reaching out to conclusions either propagating forward to an advanced research or solving a scientific problem. As they propagate through the research process, they foster and cultivate scientific curiosity, problem solving capability and ultimately, the research methodology. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qu.edu.qa/offices/research/CAM/dmsprogram/i_am_researcher.php |title=I am a Researcher |publisher=Qu.edu.qa |date=2014-03-03 |accessdate=2014-06-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://thepeninsulaqatar.com/news/qatar/283245/al-bairaq-holds-workshop-for-high-school-students |title=Al Bairaq holds workshop for high school students |publisher=The Peninsula Qatar |date=2014-05-11 |accessdate=2014-06-11}}</ref><ref>http://www.qu.edu.qa/offices/research/CAM/dmsprogram/albiraq_news/alj_honoring_al_biraq_students.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.al-sharq.com/news/details/213902#.U6gBI_mSxqU |title=\u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u0642 - \u0627\u0646\u0637\u0644\u0627\u0642 \u0628\u0631\u0646\u0627\u0645\u062c \"\u0623\u0646\u0627 \u0628\u0627\u062d\u062b\" \u0641\u064a \u062c\u0627\u0645\u0639\u0629 \u0642\u0637\u0631 |publisher=Al-sharq.com |date=2014-02-24 |accessdate=2014-06-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.raya.com/news/pages/21406b16-0283-4d73-ad9e-e22cd902d2a0 |title=\u062c\u0631\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0627\u064a\u0629 - \u062c\u0627\u0645\u0639\u0629 \u0642\u0637\u0631 \u062a\u0643\u0631\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0627\u0626\u0632\u064a\u0646 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0627\u0628\u0639\u0629 \u0645\u0646 \"\u0623\u0646\u0627 \u0628\u0627\u062d\u062b\" |publisher=Raya.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-30}}</ref>\n\nStudents demonstrate their understanding of the scientific concepts as well as their ideas and research outcomes via [[PowerPoint]] and other presentation tools.

After taking power in 1933, the Nazis quickly moved to remove internal opposition to the Nazi regime in Germany. The legal system became one of many tools for this aim and the Nazis gradually supplanted the normal justice system with political courts with wide-ranging powers. The function of the special courts was to intimidate the German public, but as they expanded their scope and took over roles previously done by ordinary courts such as ''[[Amtsgerichte]]'' this function became diluted.\n\n==Function in Germany==\n[[File:Hermann Cuhorst.JPG|thumb|[[Hermann Cuhorst]] (1899\u20131991), Chief Justice of the Special Court in [[Stuttgart]].]]\n\nSpecial courts had existed in Germany as far back as the nineteenth century.  They had generally been set up temporarily in response to some major but localised civil disturbance and then quickly dissolved once they had served their purpose.   A more permanent national network of Special Courts came into being during 1933, soon after the passage of the [[Reichstag Fire Decree]], which all but eliminated civil liberties. The scope of its power was successively augmented by the\n*\"Decree to Protect the Government of the National Socialist Revolution from Treacherous Attacks\" (21 March 1933),\n*the \"Law of 20 December 1934 against insidious Attacks upon the State and Party and for the Protection of the Party Uniform\",\n*the \"Law for the Guarantee of Peace Based on Law\" of 13 October 1933\n*and a number of extensions when [[World War II]] commenced.<ref name=\"Szanajda\">Andrew Szanajda (2007). ''The restoration of justice in postwar Hesse, 1945\u20131949'', pp. 24\u201325. Lexington Books. {{ISBN|9780739118702}}</ref>\n\nThe number of Special Courts increased from 26 in 1933 to 74 in 1942.\n\nA special court had three judges, and the [[Defense (legal)|defense]] counsel was appointed by the court. Even as heavy-handed as justice was in Nazi Germany, defendants were afforded at least nominal protections under the regular courts' rules and procedures.  These protections were swept away in the special courts, since they existed outside the ordinary judicial system. There was no possibility of appeal, and verdicts could be executed at once. The court decided the extent of evidence to consider, and \"the defense attorneys couldn't question the proof of the charges\".<ref name=\"Szanajda\"/>\n\n==Occupied Poland==\n[[File:German announcement General Government Poland 1941.jpg|thumb|250px| German announcement of the execution of 9 Polish peasants for not fulfilling quotas. Signed by the governor of [[Lublin]] district on 25 November 1941]]\n\nThe special courts played a major role in carrying out summary executions via [[judicial murder]] in [[Nazi occupied Poland]].

After taking power in 1933, the Nazis quickly moved to remove internal opposition to the Nazi regime in Germany. The legal system became one of many tools for this aim and the Nazis gradually supplanted the normal justice system with political courts with wide-ranging powers. The function of the special courts was to intimidate the German public, but as they expanded their scope and took over roles previously done by ordinary courts such as ''[[Amtsgerichte]]'' this function became diluted.\n\n==Function in Germany==\n[[File:Hermann Cuhorst.JPG|thumb|[[Hermann Cuhorst]] (1899\u20131991), Chief Justice of the Special Court in [[Stuttgart]].]]\n\nSpecial courts had existed in Germany as far back as the nineteenth century.  They had generally been set up temporarily in response to some major but localised civil disturbance and then quickly dissolved once they had served their purpose.   A more permanent national network of Special Courts came into being during 1933, soon after the passage of the [[Reichstag Fire Decree]], which all but eliminated civil liberties. The scope of its power was successively augmented by the\n*\"Decree to Protect the Government of the National Socialist Revolution from Treacherous Attacks\" (21 March 1933),\n*the \"Law of 20 December 1934 against insidious Attacks upon the State and Party and for the Protection of the Party Uniform\",\n*the \"Law for the Guarantee of Peace Based on Law\" of 13 October 1933\n*and a number of extensions when [[World War II]] commenced.<ref name=\"Szanajda\">Andrew Szanajda (2007).

Lexington Books. {{ISBN|9780739118702}}</ref>\n\nThe number of Special Courts increased from 26 in 1933 to 74 in 1942.\n\nA special court had three judges, and the [[Defense (legal)|defense]] counsel was appointed by the court. Even as heavy-handed as justice was in Nazi Germany, defendants were afforded at least nominal protections under the regular courts' rules and procedures.  These protections were swept away in the special courts, since they existed outside the ordinary judicial system. There was no possibility of appeal, and verdicts could be executed at once. The court decided the extent of evidence to consider, and \"the defense attorneys couldn't question the proof of the charges\".<ref name=\"Szanajda\"/>\n\n==Occupied Poland==\n[[File:German announcement General Government Poland 1941.jpg|thumb|250px| German announcement of the execution of 9 Polish peasants for not fulfilling quotas.
