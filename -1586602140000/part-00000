The building depicted here replaces an earlier chapel, constructed in 1893 but destroyed in 1798 in the [[French invasion of Switzerland]].

V Orte,  1887,  p. 42.</ref>]]\n'''Heinrich von Winkelried''' (d. after 1303), known as ''Schrutan'' or ''Strut'' \"the giant\", was a medieval [[knight]] in what is now [[Central Switzerland]].\n\nAs ''Strut von Winkelried'' he became the subject of a legend which makes him the slayer of a [[dragon]].\nThe legendary ''Strut'' is placed a generation before the historical character, with a ''flouruit'' in the 1240s, and his death due to poisoning by dragon-blood recorded for 1250.\n\n==Historical character==\n{{further|Winkelried}}\n''Heinrich von Winkelried, genannt Schrutan'' is recorded in a document dated 22 April 1275.<ref>J.E.Kopp: ''Geschichtsbl\u00e4tter aus der Schweiz'', Herausgegeben von J.E. Kopp, Band 2, Seite 200, 5. Beilage III a</ref>\nAfter this date and until 1303, his name figures repeatedly as that of a witness on official documents. Nothing beyond this is known about his life.\nThe [[Winkelried]] family is well attested in 13th and 14th century, the first known member being the knight Rudolf von Winkelried, attested 1248 as a follower of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]]. Heinrich therefore may have been a son of Rudolf's.\nThe home castle of the Winkelried may have been at [[Ennetmoos]] near [[Stans]]. The modern municipality of Ennetmoos has chosen dragon for its coat of arms due to the legend of Schrutan.\n\nThe nickname ''Schrutan'' (also ''Strutan, Struthan, Struth'', etc.) is derived from [[German legend]], where it is given to a giant, in particular one of the guardians of the [[Rosengarten zu Worms|Rosengarten]] in [[Heldenbuch]] literature, but it also occurs as the name of a knight at [[Attila the Hun|Etzel]]'s court in the [[Nibelungenlied]] (v. 1880). Why the historical knight was given this nickname is not known, but it was not uncommon at the time for members of the knightly classes of the Holy Roman Empire to adopt pseudonyms taken from heroic fiction. \nHeinrich's sons would have been Rudolf and Walther von Winkelried, both d. c. 1325.\n[[Hermann von Liebenau]] further assumes that one ''Heinrich genannt Schrutan'' who was buried with his wife Mechthild in [[Colmar]], [[Alsace]] must be identical with the knight,<ref>Hermann von Liebenau, ''Arnold Winkelried, seine Zeit und seine That: ein historisches Bild nach neuesten Forschungen'', 1862, p. 25.</ref> who therefore would have left Switzerland at some point after 1303, but Oechsli (1898) does not accept the identity and ascribes the equality in name to coincidence.\n\n== Legend ==\n[[File:Jauslin Drache.JPG|thumb|Schrutan's fight with the dragon, by [[Karl Jauslin]] (1842&ndash;1904)]]\nThe legend is first mentioned by [[Chronicle of the Swiss Confederation|Etterlin]] (1507), without the given name ''Strut'' and without a fixed year (but placed \"before the time of [[Rudolph I of Germany|king Rudolf]]). \nIt is expanded into greater detail  in the ''[[Chronicon Helveticum]]'' by [[Aegidius Tschudi]] (d. 1570), compiled in the 16th century and first printed in 1734. Tschudi now fixes the year of the event as 1250 and specifies the identity of the hero as one ''Struth von Winkelriedt'' (which name he emphasizes is recorded in the annals of [[Stans]]), who had been knighted by emperor Frederick at the [[siege of Faenza|battle of ''Favenz'']] (1239). \nThe legend was later included by the [[Brothers Grimm]] in their collection of [[German legend]]s (''Deutsche Sagen'' 1865, no. 218).\n\nAccording to the story as reported by Tschudi, a dragon lived in a cave near [[Stans]] (the ''Drachenloch'' near the top of [[Mueterschwandenberg]]), destroying cattle and causing much damage to the people of ''Wilen'', to the point where the village had to be abandoned and came to be known as ''\u00d6dwilen'' (deserted Wilen). The people of Unterwalden made several expeditions trying to kill the dragon with crossbows, but each time the dragon saw he was at a disadvantage, he quickly retired into his cave or ran up a steep slope like a lizard, where he was unreachable. \nAt this point, Winkelried,  who had been banished from Unterwalden for manslaughter, asked whether he would be allowed back into the land if he would kill the dragon.  This was accepted, and Struth attacked the dragon single-handedly, armed with a spear, to the point of which he had attached sharp barbs.\nThe dragon seeing that the attacker was alone came from his hiding-place and attacked with open jaws, and Winkelried was able to transfix the monster with his spear, hacking at it with his sword until it died. \nGlad for his victory, Winkelried lifted his sword over his head, thanking God, and the dragon's blood dripped from his sword blade on his body, poisoning him so that he died a few days later.\n\nToponymy referring to a dragon is found in [[Ennetmoos]], where the historical  [[Winkelried]] family originated. A ''Drachenried'' (dragon's fen) and  ''Drachenloch'' (dragon's cave) are to the west of the village, and a ''Drachenkapelle'' (dragon chapel), also known as ''Winkelriedkapelle'' dedicated to Struth is south of the village, next to ''Wychried'', the probable site of the original Winkelried estate.\nThe story is probably a recontextualisation of a much older dragon myth, put into a new historical context in late medieval folklore. \nThe \"dragon\" toponymy in this place has been associated with the older dragon narrative in the [[Nibelung]] cycle in 19th-century scholarship.<ref>\nJosef Anton Henne, ''Schweizerchronik in vier B\u00fcchern: aus den Quellen untersucht und dargestellt'', p. 110.\n''Drachenkapelle'': Robert Durrer, ''Kunstdenkm\u00e4ler im Kanton Unterwalden'' (1899-1928), 255-257.\n</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n* Hermann von Liebenau: ''Die Winkelriede von Stans bis auf Arnold Winkelried den Helden von Sempach.

V Orte,  1887,  p. 42.</ref>]]\n'''Heinrich von Winkelried''' (d. after 1303), known as ''Schrutan'' or ''Strut'' \"the giant\", was a medieval [[knight]] in what is now [[Central Switzerland]].\n\nAs ''Strut von Winkelried'' he became the subject of a legend which makes him the slayer of a [[dragon]].\nThe legendary ''Strut'' is placed a generation before the historical character, with a ''flouruit'' in the 1240s, and his death due to poisoning by dragon-blood recorded for 1250.\n\n==Historical character==\n{{further|Winkelried}}\n''Heinrich von Winkelried, genannt Schrutan'' is recorded in a document dated 22 April 1275.<ref>J.E.Kopp: ''Geschichtsbl\u00e4tter aus der Schweiz'', Herausgegeben von J.E. Kopp, Band 2, Seite 200, 5. Beilage III a</ref>\nAfter this date and until 1303, his name figures repeatedly as that of a witness on official documents. Nothing beyond this is known about his life.\nThe [[Winkelried]] family is well attested in 13th and 14th century, the first known member being the knight Rudolf von Winkelried, attested 1248 as a follower of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]]. Heinrich therefore may have been a son of Rudolf's.\nThe home castle of the Winkelried may have been at [[Ennetmoos]] near [[Stans]]. The modern municipality of Ennetmoos has chosen dragon for its coat of arms due to the legend of Schrutan.\n\nThe nickname ''Schrutan'' (also ''Strutan, Struthan, Struth'', etc.) is derived from [[German legend]], where it is given to a giant, in particular one of the guardians of the [[Rosengarten zu Worms|Rosengarten]] in [[Heldenbuch]] literature, but it also occurs as the name of a knight at [[Attila the Hun|Etzel]]'s court in the [[Nibelungenlied]] (v. 1880). Why the historical knight was given this nickname is not known, but it was not uncommon at the time for members of the knightly classes of the Holy Roman Empire to adopt pseudonyms taken from heroic fiction. \nHeinrich's sons would have been Rudolf and Walther von Winkelried, both d. c. 1325.\n[[Hermann von Liebenau]] further assumes that one ''Heinrich genannt Schrutan'' who was buried with his wife Mechthild in [[Colmar]], [[Alsace]] must be identical with the knight,<ref>Hermann von Liebenau, ''Arnold Winkelried, seine Zeit und seine That: ein historisches Bild nach neuesten Forschungen'', 1862, p. 25.</ref> who therefore would have left Switzerland at some point after 1303, but Oechsli (1898) does not accept the identity and ascribes the equality in name to coincidence.\n\n== Legend ==\n[[File:Jauslin Drache.JPG|thumb|Schrutan's fight with the dragon,  by [[Karl Jauslin]] (1842&ndash;1904)]]\nThe legend is first mentioned by [[Chronicle of the Swiss Confederation|Etterlin]] (1507), without the given name ''Strut'' and without a fixed year (but placed \"before the time of [[Rudolph I of Germany|king Rudolf]]). \nIt is expanded into greater detail  in the ''[[Chronicon Helveticum]]'' by [[Aegidius Tschudi]] (d. 1570), compiled in the 16th century and first printed in 1734. Tschudi now fixes the year of the event as 1250 and speficies the identity of the hero as one ''Struth von Winkelriedt'' (which name he emphasizes is recorded in the annals of [[Stans]]), who had been knighted by emperor Frederick at the [[siege of Faenza|battle of ''Favenz'']] (1239). \nThe legend was later included by the [[Brothers Grimm]] in their collection of [[German legend]]s (''Deutsche Sagen'' 1865, no. 218).\n\nAccording to the story as reported by Tschudi, a dragon lived in a cave near [[Stans]] (the ''Drachenloch'' near the top of [[Mueterschwandenberg]]), destroying cattle and causing much damage to the people of ''Wilen'', to the point where the village had to be abandoned and came to be known as ''\u00d6dwilen'' (deserted Wilen). The people of Unterwalden made several expeditions trying to kill the dragon with crossbows, but each time the dragon saw he was at a disadvantage, he quickly retired into his cave or ran up a steep slope like a lizard, where he was unreachable. \nAt this point, Winkelried,  who had been banished from Unterwalden for manslaughter, asked whether he would be allowed back into the land if he would kill the dragon.  This was accepted, and Struth attacked the dragon single-handedly, armed with a spear, to the point of which he had attached sharp barbs.\nThe dragon seeing that the attacker was alone came from his hiding-place and attacked with open jaws, and Winkelried was able to transfix the monster with his spear, hacking at it with his sword until it died. \nGlad for his victory, Winkelried lifted his sword over his head, thanking God, and the dragon's blood dripped from his sword blade on his body, poisoning him so that he died a few days later.\n\nToponymy referring to a dragon is found in [[Ennetmoos]], where the historical  [[Winkelried]] family originated. A ''Drachenried'' (dragon's fen) and  ''Drachenloch'' (dragon's cave) are to the west of the village, and a ''Drachenkapelle'' (dragon chapel), also known as ''Winkelriedkapelle'' dedicated to Struth is south of the village, next to ''Wychried'', the probable site of the original Winkelried estate.\nThe story is probably a recontextualisation of a much older dragon myth, put into a new historical context in late medieval folklore. \nThe \"dragon\" toponymy in this place has been associated with the older dragon narrative in the [[Nibelung]] cycle in 19th-century scholarship.<ref>\nJosef Anton Henne, ''Schweizerchronik in vier B\u00fcchern: aus den Quellen untersucht und dargestellt'', p. 110.\n''Drachenkapelle'': Robert Durrer, ''Kunstdenkm\u00e4ler im Kanton Unterwalden'' (1899-1928), 255-257.\n</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n* Hermann von Liebenau: ''Die Winkelriede von Stans bis auf Arnold Winkelried den Helden von Sempach.

Scholars have suspected it to have been either [[smallpox]]<ref>H.

The epidemic may have claimed the life of a [[Roman emperor]], [[Lucius Verus]], who died in 169 and was the co-regent of [[Marcus Aurelius|Marcus Aurelius Antoninus]], whose family name, Antoninus, has become associated with the epidemic. The disease broke out again nine years later, according to the Roman historian [[Dio Cassius]] (155\u2013235), and caused up to 2,000 deaths a day in Rome, one quarter of those who were affected, which gives the disease a mortality rate of about 25%.<ref>Dio Cassius, LXXII 14.3\u20134; his book that would cover the plague under Marcus Aurelius is missing; the later outburst was the greatest of which the historian had knowledge.</ref> The total deaths have been estimated at 5 million,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4381924.stm \"Past pandemics that ravaged Europe\"], BBC News, November 7, 2005</ref> and the disease killed as much as one third of the population in some areas and devastated the Roman army.<ref>[http://www.loyno.edu/~history/journal/1996-7/Smith.html Plague in the Ancient World]</ref>\n\nAncient sources agree that the epidemic appeared first during the Roman siege of [[Seleucia]] in the winter of 165\u2013166.<ref>Martin Sicker,  (2000). \"The Struggle over the Euphrates Frontier\".

[[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]] asserted that a large population died throughout the empire.<ref>Eutropius XXXI, 6.24.</ref>\n\n[[Rafe de Crespigny]] speculates that the plague may have also broken out in [[Eastern Han]] China before 166 because of notices of plagues in [[Twenty-Four Histories|Chinese records]]. The plague affected [[Roman culture]] and [[Roman literature|literature]] and may have severely affected [[Indo-Roman trade relations]] in the [[Indian Ocean]].\n\n== Epidemiology ==\n[[File:Galenosgruppe (Wiener Dioskurides).jpg|thumb|A group of physicians in an image from the [[Vienna Dioscurides]], named after the physician [[Galen]] shown at the top centre.]]\nIn 120, during the epidemic, the Greek physician and writer [[Galen]] travelled from [[Rome]] to his home in [[Asia Minor]] and returned to Rome in 168, when he was summoned by the two [[Augustus (honorific)|Augusti]], the co-emperors [[Marcus Aurelius]] and [[Lucius Verus]]. He w'', and he scattered other references to it among his voluminous writings. He described the plague as \"great\" and of long duration and mentions [[fever]], [[diarrhea]] and [[pharyngitis]] as well as a skin eruption and sometimes dry and sometimes [[pus|pustular]] that appeared on the ninth day of the illness. The information that was provided by Galen dis not clearly define the nature of the disease, but scholars have generally preferred to diagnose it as smallpox.<ref>See [[Frank McLynn|McLynn, Frank]], ''Marcus Aurelius, Warrior, Philosopher, Emperor'', Vintage Books, London, 2009.{{page needed|date=November 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe historian [[William Hardy McNeill|William McNeill]]<ref>McNeill, W.H. 1976 ''Plagues and Peoples''.

The severe devastation to the European population from the two plagues may indicate that people had no previous exposure to either disease, which brought immunity to survivors. Other historians believe that both outbreaks involved smallpox.<ref>D. Ch.

[[Barthold Georg Niebuhr]] (1776\u20131831) concluded that \"as the reign of [[Marcus Aurelius]] forms a turning point in so many things, and above all in literature and art, I have no doubt that this crisis was brought about by that plague.... The ancient world never recovered from the blow inflicted on it by the plague which visited it in the reign of Marcus Aurelius.\"<ref>Niebuhr, ''Lectures on the history of Rome'' III, Lecture CXXXI (London 1849), quoted by Gilliam 1961:225</ref> During the [[Marcomannic Wars]], Marcus Aurelius wrote his philosophical work ''[[Meditations]]''. A passage (IX.2) states that even the pestilence around him was less deadly than falsehood, evil behaviour and lack of true understanding. As he lay dying, he uttered the words, \"Weep not for me; think rather of the pestilence and the deaths of so many others.\" [[Edward Gibbon]] (1737\u20131794) and [[Michael Rostovtzeff]] (1870\u20131952) assigned the Antonine plague less influence than contemporary political and economic trends, respectively.\n\n==Military concerns==\n[[File:Marcus Aurelius Sestertius 177 860042.jpg|thumb|A [[Roman coin]] commemorating the victories of [[Marcus Aurelius]] in the [[Marcomannic Wars]] against the Germanic tribes along the [[Danube]] frontier in the early 170s AD]]\nSome direct effects of the contagion stand out. When imperial forces moved east, under the command of Emperor Verus, after the forces of [[Vologases IV of Parthia]] attacked [[Armenia]], the Romans' defense of the eastern territories was hampered when large numbers of troops succumbed to the disease. According to the 5th-century Spanish writer [[Paulus Orosius]], many towns and villages in the [[Italian Peninsula]] and the [[Europe|European]] provinces of lost all of their inhabitants. As the disease swept north to the [[Rhine]], it also infected [[Germanic tribes|Germanic]] and [[Gaul|Gallic]] peoples outside the wmpire's borders. For a number of years, those northern groups had pressed south in search of more lands to sustain their growing populations. With their ranks thinned by the epidemic, Roman armies were now unable to push the tribes back. From 167 to his death, Marcus Aurelius personally commanded legions near the [[Danube]], trying, with only partial success, to control the advance of Germanic peoples across the river. A major offensive against the [[Marcomanni]] was postponed to 169 because of a shortage of imperial troops.\n\n==Indian Ocean trade and Han China==\n\nAlthough [[Ge Hong]] was the first writer of [[traditional Chinese medicine]] who accurately described the symptoms of smallpox, the historian [[Rafe de Crespigny]] mused that the plagues afflicting the [[Eastern Han]] Empire during the reigns of [[Emperor Huan of Han]] (r. 146-168) and [[Emperor Ling of Han]] (r. 168\u2013189)&nbsp;\u2013 with outbreaks in 151, 161, 171, 173, 179, 182, and 185&nbsp;\u2013 were perhaps connected to the Antonine plague on the western end of [[Eurasia]].<ref>[[Rafe de Crespigny|de Crespigny, Rafe]].

The epidemic may have claimed the life of a [[Roman emperor]], [[Lucius Verus]], who died in 169 and was the co-regent of [[Marcus Aurelius|Marcus Aurelius Antoninus]], whose family name, Antoninus, has become associated with the epidemic. The disease broke out again nine years later, according to the Roman historian [[Dio Cassius]] (155\u2013235), and caused up to 2,000 deaths a day in Rome, one quarter of those who were affected, which gives the disease a mortality rate of about 25%.<ref>Dio Cassius, LXXII 14.3\u20134; his book that would cover the plague under Marcus Aurelius is missing; the later outburst was the greatest of which the historian had knowledge.</ref> The total deaths have been estimated at 5 million,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4381924.stm \"Past pandemics that ravaged Europe\"], BBC News, November 7, 2005</ref> and the disease killed as much as one third of the population in some areas and devastated the Roman army.<ref>[http://www.loyno.edu/~history/journal/1996-7/Smith.html Plague in the Ancient World]</ref>\n\nAncient sources agree that the epidemic appeared first during the Roman siege of [[Seleucia]] in the winter of 165\u2013166.<ref>Martin Sicker,  (2000). \"The Struggle over the Euphrates Frontier\".

He was present at the outbreak among troops stationed at [[Aquileia]] in the winter of 168/69. Galen briefly recorded observations and a description of the epidemic in the treatise ''Methodus Medendi'', and he scattered other references to it among his voluminous writings. He described the plague as \"great\" and of long duration and mentions [[fever]], [[diarrhea]] and [[pharyngitis]] as well as a skin eruption and sometimes dry and sometimes [[pus|pustular]] that appeared on the ninth day of the illness. The information that was provided by Galen dis not clearly define the nature of the disease, but scholars have generally preferred to diagnose it as smallpox.<ref>See [[Frank McLynn|McLynn, Frank]], ''Marcus Aurelius, Warrior, Philosopher, Emperor'', Vintage Books, London, 2009.{{page needed|date=November 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe historian [[William Hardy McNeill|William McNeill]]<ref>McNeill, W.H. 1976 ''Plagues and Peoples''.

[[Lucian of Samosata]]'s irony-laden account of the charlatan [[Alexander of Abonoteichus]] records a verse of his \"which he despatched to all the nations during the pestilence... was to be seen written over doorways everywhere\", particularly in the houses that were emptied, Lucian further remarks.<ref>Lucian, ''Alexander'', 36.</ref>\n\nThe epidemic had drastic social and political effects throughout the Roman Empire. [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr]] (1776\u20131831) concluded that \"as the reign of [[Marcus Aurelius]] forms a turning point in so many things, and above all in literature and art, I have no doubt that this crisis was brought about by that plague.... The ancient world never recovered from the blow inflicted on it by the plague which visited it in the reign of Marcus Aurelius.\"<ref>Niebuhr, ''Lectures on the history of Rome'' III, Lecture CXXXI (London 1849), quoted by Gilliam 1961:225</ref> During the [[Marcomannic Wars]], Marcus Aurelius wrote his philosophical work ''[[Meditations]]''. A passage (IX.2) states that even the pestilence around him was less deadly than falsehood, evil behaviour and lack of true understanding. As he lay dying, he uttered the words, \"Weep not for me; think rather of the pestilence and the deaths of so many others.\" [[Edward Gibbon]] (1737\u20131794) and [[Michael Rostovtzeff]] (1870\u20131952) assigned the Antonine plague less influence than contemporary political and economic trends, respectively.\n\n==Military concerns==\n[[File:Marcus Aurelius Sestertius 177 860042.jpg|thumb|A [[Roman coin]] commemorating the victories of [[Marcus Aurelius]] in the [[Marcomannic Wars]] against the Germanic tribes along the [[Danube]] frontier in the early 170s AD]]\nSome direct effects of the contagion stand out. When imperial forces moved east, under the command of Emperor Verus, after the forces of [[Vologases IV of Parthia]] attacked [[Armenia]], the Romans' defense of the eastern territories was hampered when large numbers of troops succumbed to the disease. According to the 5th-century Spanish writer [[Paulus Orosius]], many towns and villages in the [[Italian Peninsula]] and the [[Europe|European]] provinces of lost all of their inhabitants. As the disease swept north to the [[Rhine]], it also infected [[Germanic tribes|Germanic]] and [[Gaul|Gallic]] peoples outside the wmpire's borders. For a number of years, those northern groups had pressed south in search of more lands to sustain their growing populations. With their ranks thinned by the epidemic, Roman armies were now unable to push the tribes back. From 167 to his death, Marcus Aurelius personally commanded legions near the [[Danube]], trying, with only partial success, to control the advance of Germanic peoples across the river. A major offensive against the [[Marcomanni]] was postponed to 169 because of a shortage of imperial troops.\n\n==Indian Ocean trade and Han China==\n\nAlthough [[Ge Hong]] was the first writer of [[traditional Chinese medicine]] who accurately described the symptoms of smallpox, the historian [[Rafe de Crespigny]] mused that the plagues afflicting the [[Eastern Han]] Empire during the reigns of [[Emperor Huan of Han]] (r. 146-168) and [[Emperor Ling of Han]] (r. 168\u2013189)&nbsp;\u2013 with outbreaks in 151, 161, 171, 173, 179, 182, and 185&nbsp;\u2013 were perhaps connected to the Antonine plague on the western end of [[Eurasia]].<ref>[[Rafe de Crespigny|de Crespigny, Rafe]].
