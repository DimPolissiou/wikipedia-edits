It was co-produced with [[France]]. The film was entered into the [[16th Berlin International Film Festival]].\n\n==Plot==\nEfisio Mulas is a meek laborer who lives with occasional work, especially in Don Leandro Sanna's salon, and rounds up the slim balance by betting with colleagues in strength with the game \"head against head\". In the village the Sanna and Porcu families' conflict has lasted over a century.\n\nThe normality of the events is broken by the release, for the amnesty wanted by the pope, of the beautiful Domenicangela Piras, the turbulent girlfriend of Efisio convicted for having hurt him with a billhook. At the same time the old man of honor, Agostino Sanna, is about to instigate his nephew Don Leandro to kill Alvaro Porcu. Don Leandro does not intend to support his uncle, so it takes time, insinuating that Alvaro Porcu has been hiding in Supramonte for fear of him.\n\nEfisio marries Domenicangela having, finally, obtained the consent of her father required by the priest, the fugitive don Liberato.

Don Leandro does not intend to support his uncle, so it takes time, insinuating that Alvaro Porcu has been hiding in Supramonte for fear of him.\n\nEfisio gets married to Domenicangela having, finally, obtained the consent of her father required by the priest, the fugitive don Liberato.

A \"bale of wool\" is also the standard trading unit for wool on the wholesale national and international markets. \n[[File:Sign for the Woolpack - geograph.org.uk - 1721494.jpg|thumb|Sign for the Woolpack [[public house]], Fishbourne, West Sussex, showing the historic form of the modern wool bale]]\nThe minimum weight of a bale is {{convert|120|kg}} {{as of|January 2016|lc=y}}.\n\n==Wool packs==\nPackaging of wool has not changed much for centuries except that the early wool packs were made from [[jute]], prior to the use of synthetic fibres. Jute packs were relatively heavy, weighing several [[kilogram]]s each. In the 1960s [[polypropylene]] and high-density polyethylene packs were manufactured and used to make wool bales. Loose [[fibres]] from these packs caused contamination of the wool in the bale and led to [[nylon]] becoming the regulation fabric used in Australia,<ref>{{cite web|title=About the wool industry|url=http://www2.dpi.qld.gov.au/sheep/6572.html|work=Facts and figures on sheep and wool|publisher=Queensland Government|accessdate=9 August 2011}}</ref> In [[South Africa]] woven paper was tested but discontinued in 1973 due to poor wet strength and high cost.<ref name=\"Cottle\">{{cite book|last= Cottle|first=David J.|title= Australian Sheep and Wool Handbook |year=1991|publisher= Inkata Press|location= Melbourne|isbn=0909605602 |pages=340\u201342}}</ref> Regulation standard white nylon packs now have a {{convert|280|mm|in|abbr=on}} label sewn onto the top flap of the wool pack for inclusion of the farm brand, wool description, bale number, [[woolclasser]] stencil number and bin code.

During the late 19th century various forms of wooden wool press became the standard. Most popular models were the Koerstz and the Ferrier. The Koerstz was a smaller press than the Ferrier. The Ferrier press was manufactured under license by Humble & Nicholson (later Humble & Sons), Geelong, Victoria, and they had sold 2,000 presses between about 1871 and 1918. These presses were distributed throughout Australia, but were also sent overseas to New Zealand, South America, and North Africa.<ref>Register of Ferrier wool presses manufactured between 1861 and 1963</ref> The steel Ajax wool presses were also used. Wool pressing with a manual wool press was hard, tiring work that required tramping the wool into a box and then pressing it further with a manually operated lever activated cable. Nowadays power operated, self-pinning wool presses with inbuilt scales have made a major contribution to [[shearing shed]] productivity.<ref name=\"Cottle\"/>\n\nWool bales have been transported by [[camel]], [[Australian Draught Horse|horse teams]], [[bullock cart|bullock wagons]], [[paddle steamer]], [[Ship transport|boats]] and later by [[Rail transport|rail]] and [[Road transport|trucks]].<ref name=\"Cowley\">{{cite book|last= Cowley |first=Clarence E.|title= Classing the Clip |year=1949|publisher= Angus and Robertson|location= London|isbn=|pages=112\u2013120}}</ref>\n\n==Method==\n[[File:Pressing wool from The Powerhouse Museum Collection.jpg|thumb|200px|A hand operated wool press in action, circa 1900.]]\nPressing and branding are typically carried out by a wool presser in the larger shearing sheds.<ref name=\" D\u2019Arcy\">{{cite book|last= D\u2019Arcy |first=J.B.|title= Sheep Management & Wool Technology |year=1986|publisher= , NSW University Press |location= Kensington|isbn=0-86840-106-4|pages=202}}</ref> In small sheds, the pressing may be done by the woolclasser, wool handler or sheep owner. A wool presser may perform the combined duties of wool pressing and penning up the sheep for the shearers. The latter arrangement means less interruption to the flow of the wool across the table and into the wool bins.<ref name=\"Cowley\"/>\n\nThe [[woolclasser]] oversees the duties of the wool presser during the entire [[sheep shearing|shearing]]. The presser ensures that the wool pack is free of any contaminants before he places it into the wool press and secures it there. He then carries the wool from the selected wool bin, removing any contamination, before placing it into the press.<ref name=\"Cowley\"/>\n\nIt takes about 60 skirted fleeces to fill a wool bale, depending on the size and age of the sheep.  The presser closes the bale with four internal and five external metal bale fasteners, before weighing the bale, if the press does not have an inbuilt scale. Bales should weigh between {{convert|110|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|204|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, unless the wool is under 18.6 [[micron]]s, in which case they may be a minimum gross weight of {{convert|90|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}. Bales that weigh less than {{convert|110|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} are known as a butt and those over {{convert|204|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} will not be sold at auction without repacking at the vendor's expense. The maximum wool bale length is {{convert|1.25|m|in|1|abbr=off}}.

These sheets are bulky yet are light (weighing about {{convert|60|kg|lb|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and convenient for the small farmer to transport to his local wool collection centre. Here they are opened for grading and sorting into one of several dozen different qualities, based on breed of sheep, which dictates fineness of wool, and physical condition of the wool, for example damp dirty or stained fleeces will be graded lowly.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nOnce a sufficient volume of fleeces of a particular grade has filled a grading bin, the wool is compressed into a bale by a packing machine, producing a single bale equivalent to the capacity of some 5 1/2 wool sheets, a weight of {{convert|330|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}. Such bales are most economical for shipping purposes, but clearly require mechanised lifting equipment.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nThe collection process for wool in England has remained the same for many centuries. Shepherds brought their fleeces to a local collection point, for example [[Chipping Camden]] for wool from the [[Cotswolds]], where it would be graded, paid for, consolidated into bales, sold to wholesalers and shipped to the manufacturer. The existence of bales in ancient times is attested by the custom of the English [[Lord Chancellor]] to sit on the so-called [[Woolsack]] from which he presides over  the [[House of Lords]]. This seat is therefore not in reality a \"sack\", in which the shepherds probably brought 20 or so fleeces, probably two per mule, being the equivalent of today's \"sheet\", but is rather a bale, compacted by the weight of human feet at the merchant's premises.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\n==Sale of wool==\nMost Australian wool is sold at [[auction]] sales in [[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]] and [[Fremantle]] which are conducted by the [[Australian Wool Exchange]] (AWEX). Renowned Australian Brands like Merino & Co. use specialist woolgrowers from the [https://www.woolnetwork.com.au/ Australian Wool Network] and are known for their high quality and taking care to grow and select wool to exacting standards and specifications.\nTheir merino wool products cover a wide range of clothing, from [https://merinoandco.com.au/menswear/merino-underwear men's thermal underwear] to [https://merinoandco.com.au/womenswear/merino-dresses-skirts merino wool winter skirts].

It is then weighed by sworn weighers (this weight is marked on the bale and recorded and is the basis on which buyers are invoiced), and then core sampled. This sample will then be tested for [[Micron (wool)|micron]], yield and vegetable matter as a minimum. Wool that is to be sold by sample has a minimum of one grab, of a specified weight, taken from each bale and a minimum of 20 grabs, from each lot. Speciality wool is often traditionally displayed in original wool bales with the test results displayed. Wool not sold by the traditional display system will be directed to various parts in the warehouse for stacking and storing.

A \"bale of wool\" is also the standard trading unit for wool on the wholesale national and international markets. \n[[File:Sign for the Woolpack - geograph.org.uk - 1721494.jpg|thumb|Sign for the Woolpack [[public house]], Fishbourne, West Sussex, showing the historic form of the modern wool bale]]\nThe minimum weight of a bale is {{convert|120|kg}} {{as of|January 2016|lc=y}}.\n\n==Wool packs==\nPackaging of wool has not changed much for centuries except that the early wool packs were made from [[jute]], prior to the use of synthetic fibres. Jute packs were relatively heavy, weighing several [[kilogram]]s each. In the 1960s [[polypropylene]] and high-density polyethylene packs were manufactured and used to make wool bales. Loose [[fibres]] from these packs caused contamination of the wool in the bale and led to [[nylon]] becoming the regulation fabric used in Australia,<ref>{{cite web|title=About the wool industry|url=http://www2.dpi.qld.gov.au/sheep/6572.html|work=Facts and figures on sheep and wool|publisher=Queensland Government|accessdate=9 August 2011}}</ref> In [[South Africa]] woven paper was tested but discontinued in 1973 due to poor wet strength and high cost.<ref name=\"Cottle\">{{cite book|last= Cottle|first=David J.|title= Australian Sheep and Wool Handbook |year=1991|publisher= Inkata Press|location= Melbourne|isbn=0909605602 |pages=340\u201342}}</ref> Regulation standard white nylon packs now have a {{convert|280|mm|in|abbr=on}} label sewn onto the top flap of the wool pack for inclusion of the farm brand, wool description, bale number, [[woolclasser]] stencil number and bin code.

During the late 19th century various forms of wooden wool press became the standard. Most popular models were the Koerstz and the Ferrier. The Koerstz was a smaller press than the Ferrier. The Ferrier press was manufactured under license by Humble & Nicholson (later Humble & Sons), Geelong, Victoria, and they had sold 2,000 presses between about 1871 and 1918. These presses were distributed throughout Australia, but were also sent overseas to New Zealand, South America, and North Africa.<ref>Register of Ferrier wool presses manufactured between 1861 and 1963</ref> The steel Ajax wool presses were also used. Wool pressing with a manual wool press was hard, tiring work that required tramping the wool into a box and then pressing it further with a manually operated lever activated cable. Nowadays power operated, self-pinning wool presses with inbuilt scales have made a major contribution to [[shearing shed]] productivity.<ref name=\"Cottle\"/>\n\nWool bales have been transported by [[camel]], [[Australian Draught Horse|horse teams]], [[bullock cart|bullock wagons]], [[paddle steamer]], [[Ship transport|boats]] and later by [[Rail transport|rail]] and [[Road transport|trucks]].<ref name=\"Cowley\">{{cite book|last= Cowley |first=Clarence E.|title= Classing the Clip |year=1949|publisher= Angus and Robertson|location= London|isbn=|pages=112\u2013120}}</ref>\n\n==Method==\n[[File:Pressing wool from The Powerhouse Museum Collection.jpg|thumb|200px|A hand operated wool press in action, circa 1900.]]\nPressing and branding are typically carried out by a wool presser in the larger shearing sheds.<ref name=\" D\u2019Arcy\">{{cite book|last= D\u2019Arcy |first=J.B.|title= Sheep Management & Wool Technology |year=1986|publisher= , NSW University Press |location= Kensington|isbn=0-86840-106-4|pages=202}}</ref> In small sheds, the pressing may be done by the woolclasser, wool handler or sheep owner. A wool presser may perform the combined duties of wool pressing and penning up the sheep for the shearers. The latter arrangement means less interruption to the flow of the wool across the table and into the wool bins.<ref name=\"Cowley\"/>\n\nThe [[woolclasser]] oversees the duties of the wool presser during the entire [[sheep shearing|shearing]]. The presser ensures that the wool pack is free of any contaminants before he places it into the wool press and secures it there. He then carries the wool from the selected wool bin, removing any contamination, before placing it into the press.<ref name=\"Cowley\"/>\n\nIt takes about 60 skirted fleeces to fill a wool bale, depending on the size and age of the sheep.  The presser closes the bale with four internal and five external metal bale fasteners, before weighing the bale, if the press does not have an inbuilt scale. Bales should weigh between {{convert|110|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|204|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, unless the wool is under 18.6 [[micron]]s, in which case they may be a minimum gross weight of {{convert|90|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}. Bales that weigh less than {{convert|110|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} are known as a butt and those over {{convert|204|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} will not be sold at auction without repacking at the vendor's expense. The maximum wool bale length is {{convert|1.25|m|in|1|abbr=off}}.

These sheets are bulky yet are light (weighing about {{convert|60|kg|lb|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and convenient for the small farmer to transport to his local wool collection centre. Here they are opened for grading and sorting into one of several dozen different qualities, based on breed of sheep, which dictates fineness of wool, and physical condition of the wool, for example damp dirty or stained fleeces will be graded lowly.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nOnce a sufficient volume of fleeces of a particular grade has filled a grading bin, the wool is compressed into a bale by a packing machine, producing a single bale equivalent to the capacity of some 5 1/2 wool sheets, a weight of {{convert|330|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}. Such bales are most economical for shipping purposes, but clearly require mechanised lifting equipment.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nThe collection process for wool in England has remained the same for many centuries. Shepherds brought their fleeces to a local collection point, for example [[Chipping Camden]] for wool from the [[Cotswolds]], where it would be graded, paid for, consolidated into bales, sold to wholesalers and shipped to the manufacturer. The existence of bales in ancient times is attested by the custom of the English [[Lord Chancellor]] to sit on the so-called [[Woolsack]] from which he presides over  the [[House of Lords]]. This seat is therefore not in reality a \"sack\", in which the shepherds probably brought 20 or so fleeces, probably two per mule, being the equivalent of today's \"sheet\", but is rather a bale, compacted by the weight of human feet at the merchant's premises.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\n==Sale of wool==\nMost Australian wool is sold at [[auction]] sales in [[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]], [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], and [[Fremantle]] which are conducted by the [[Australian Wool Exchange]] (AWEX).

Her work was integral to British Magazine ''[[The New Age]]'' which she helped edit along with her lover, [[A. R. Orage]], prior to the outbreak of the [[First World War]]. Hastings was also friend and lover of [[Katherine Mansfield]], whose work was first published in ''The New Age''.<ref>Edensor, Louise. (2016).

''The Craft of Literary Biography''. p. 118</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n\nBeatrice Hastings was born in London but grew up in Port Elizabeth, South Africa. She was educated in Pevensey, Kent, near [[Hastings]], which may have supplied her chosen name.<ref>Robert Scholes, Modernist Journals Project https://modjourn.org/biography/hastings-beatrice-emily-alice-haigh-1879-1943/</ref>. \n\nIn 1907 she met [[A. R. Orage]], the editor of [[The New Age]] magazine, with whom she embarked on a romantic relationship. Hastings soon began contributing to the magazine and went on to become one of its most prolific contributors, although most of her work appeared under [[pseudonyms]]. These include: Pagan, Alice Morning, A.M.A., E.H., B.L.H., Beatrice Tina, Cynicus, Robert a Field, T.K.L., D. Triformis, Edward Stafford, S. Robert West, V.M., G. Whiz, J. Wilson, Annette Doorly, Hastings Lloyd, Mrs. Malaprop, and T.W. <ref>Robert Scholes, Modernist Journals Project https://modjourn.org/biography/hastings-beatrice-emily-alice-haigh-1879-1943/</ref>. \n\nHastings' work for ''The New Age'' spanned many different forms and genres, including items of correspondence, parody, poetry, polemic, travel writing, prose fiction, and dramatic dialogue. She described herself in one instance as 'a minor poet of the first class.'<ref>Beatrice Hastings, \u2018Two Reviews\u2019, The New Age, 13.26 (October 23rd, 1913) , p.759.</ref>. One of Hastings' greatest talents was parody, and she composed parodies of many her contemporaries, including [[Ezra Pound]], [[Filippo Marinetti]], and  [[H.G. Wells]].<ref>See: \"T.K.L.\", 'The Way Back to America' (NA 13.21); \"T.K.L.\", 'Wake Up, England!\" (NA 15.8), \"B.H. and K.M.\", 'A P.S.A.' (NA 9.4)</ref>. Hastings was also outspoken in her feminist views and ''The New Age'' correspondence section provided the space in which she developed many of the ideas which would inform her 1909 feminist tract, ''Woman's Worst Enemy: Woman''. \n\nIn 1914 Hastings moved to Paris and became a figure in bohemian circles due to her friendship with [[Max Jacob]]. She shared an apartment in [[Montparnasse]] with [[Amedeo Modigliani]] and became a model for countless paintings, including his 1916 ''[[Seated Nude (1916)|Seated Nude]]''. Another friend was adventure novelist [[Charles Beadle]], with whom she had several things in common. He grew up in Hackney, spent time in South Africa (participating in the Boer War as a member of the British South African Police), and published several novels about [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] life in Paris. When Beadle came to America, from Paris, in November 1916, he listed Hastings as his nearest friend in Paris.\n\nTowards the end of her life Hastings felt excluded from the literary recognition she felt her due, and blamed Orage, whom she accused of conspiring to keep her out of literary circles in Britain. She published a pamphlet, ''The Old New Age'' (1936), in which she bitterly criticised Orage, calling him 'a rustic, a lout, a snob\u2019.<ref>Beatrice Hastings, The Old New Age: Orage and Others (London: Blue Moon Press, 1936), p.18</ref>. Hastings claimed that she \u2018offended Orage\u2019s masculine amour-propre, and for this, was made the victim of a social cabale [\u2026] a literary boycott that does, or should, matter to every reading person\u2019.<ref>Hastings, The Old New Age, p.3</ref>. While many of the contents of this pamphlet are thought to be exaggerated, it nevertheless shines a light on Orage's already well-documented misogyny, and the experience of being a female author in the 1910s.\n\nIn 1943, probably suffering from cancer, she killed herself with gas from a domestic cooker.\n\n== Posthumous Recognition ==\n\nAlthough in her lifetime, Hastings was regarded as a relatively minor literary figure, more recently she has been praised for her innovative use of pseudonyms and her pioneering feminist views.\n\nWallace Martin mentions her in his seminal study of [[The New Age]], commenting that \u2018Beatrice Hastings displayed amazing versatility as reviewer, poet, and satirist; she was most effective, albeit unnecessarily malicious, in the last capacity.\u2019<ref>Wallace Martin, The New Age Under Orage: Chapters in English Cultural History (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1967), p.125.</ref> \n\nLiterary critic [[Robert Scholes]] has noted that \"Hastings, who was an important presence on the ''New Age'' editorial staff before the war, had an unhappy life that ended in suicide, never receiving the recognition as a writer that she sought.\"<ref>[[Robert Scholes|Scholes, Robert]]. (2008). ''Paradoxy of Modernism''. Yale University Press. p. 222. {{ISBN|978-0-300-10820-0}}</ref>\n\n==Theosophy==\n\nHastings was a convert to [[Theosophical Society|Theosophy]]. She attempted to defend [[Helena Blavatsky]] from charges of fraud and [[plagiarism]]. In 1937, she published two volumes entitled, ''Defence of Madame Blavatsky''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Gomes |first=Michael |title=Beatrice Hastings and the Defence of Madame Blavatsky |url=http://www.theosophycanada.com/files/hastings-solovyoff-fraud.pdf |accessdate=28 December 2017 |url-status= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228170602/http://www.theosophycanada.com/files/hastings-solovyoff-fraud.pdf |archivedate=28 December 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nHer writings on Theosophy have been criticized by [[Skepticism|skeptics]].

Her work was integral to British Magazine ''[[The New Age]]'' which she helped edit along with her lover, [[A. R. Orage]], prior to the outbreak of the [[First World War]]. Hastings was also friend and lover of [[Katherine Mansfield]], whose work was first published in ''The New Age''.<ref>Edensor, Louise. (2016). ''Une profession de foi pour tourjours: Katherine Mansfield and Beatrice Hastings in France''. In Claire Davison, Gerri Kimber. ''Katherine Mansfield\u2019s French Lives''. Brill. pp. 23-39. {{ISBN|978-90-04-28368-8}}</ref> She also had love affairs with [[Wyndham Lewis]] and [[Amedeo Modigliani]]<ref>[[Jeffrey Meyers|Meyers, Jeffrey]]. (1985). ''The Craft of Literary Biography''. p. 118</ref> .\n\n==Biography==\n\nBeatrice Hastings was born in London but grew up in Port Elizabeth, South Africa. She was educated in Pevensey, Kent, near [[Hastings]], which may have supplied her chosen name.<ref>Robert Scholes, Modernist Journals Project https://modjourn.org/biography/hastings-beatrice-emily-alice-haigh-1879-1943/</ref>. \n\nIn 1907 she met [[A. R. Orage]], the editor of [[The New Age]] magazine, with whom she embarked on a romantic relationship. Hastings soon began contributing to the magazine and went on to become one of its most prolific contributors, although most of her work appeared under [[pseudonyms]]. These include: Pagan, Alice Morning, A.M.A., E.H., B.L.H., Beatrice Tina, Cynicus, Robert a Field, T.K.L., D. Triformis, Edward Stafford, S. Robert West, V.M., G. Whiz, J. Wilson, Annette Doorly, Hastings Lloyd, Mrs. Malaprop, and T.W. <ref>Robert Scholes, Modernist Journals Project https://modjourn.org/biography/hastings-beatrice-emily-alice-haigh-1879-1943/</ref>. \n\nHastings' work for ''The New Age'' spanned many different forms and genres, including items of correspondence, parody, poetry, polemic, travel writing, prose fiction, and dramatic dialogue. She described herself in one instance as 'a minor poet of the first class.'<ref>Beatrice Hastings, \u2018Two Reviews\u2019, The New Age, 13.26 (October 23rd, 1913) , p.759.</ref>. One of Hastings' greatest talents was parody, and she composed parodies of many her contemporaries, including [[Ezra Pound]], [[Filippo Marinetti]], and  [[H.G. Wells]].<ref>See: \"T.K.L.\", 'The Way Back to America' (NA 13.21); \"T.K.L.\", 'Wake Up, England!\" (NA 15.8), \"B.H. and K.M.\", 'A P.S.A.' (NA 9.4)</ref>. Hastings was also outspoken in her feminist views and ''The New Age'' correspondence section provided the space in which she developed many of the ideas which would inform her 1909 feminist tract, ''Woman's Worst Enemy: Woman''. \n\nIn 1914 Hastings moved to Paris and became a figure in bohemian circles due to her friendship with [[Max Jacob]]. She shared an apartment in [[Montparnasse]] with [[Amedeo Modigliani]] and became a model for countless paintings, including his 1916 ''[[Seated Nude (1916)|Seated Nude]]''. Another friend was adventure novelist [[Charles Beadle]], with whom she had several things in common. He grew up in Hackney, spent time in South Africa (participating in the Boer War as a member of the British South African Police), and published several novels about [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] life in Paris. When Beadle came to America, from Paris, in November 1916, he listed Hastings as his nearest friend in Paris.\n\nTowards the end of her life Hastings felt excluded from the literary recognition she felt her due, and blamed Orage, whom she accused of conspiring to keep her out of literary circles in Britain. She published a pamphlet, ''The Old New Age'' (1936), in which she bitterly criticised Orage, calling him 'a rustic, a lout, a snob\u2019.<ref>Beatrice Hastings, The Old New Age: Orage and Others (London: Blue Moon Press, 1936), p.18</ref>. Hastings claimed that she \u2018offended Orage\u2019s masculine amour-propre, and for this, was made the victim of a social cabale [\u2026] a literary boycott that does, or should, matter to every reading person\u2019.<ref>Hastings, The Old New Age, p.3</ref>. While many of the contents of this pamphlet are thought to be exaggerated, it nevertheless shines a light on Orage's already well-documented misogyny, and the experience of being a female author in the 1910s.\n\nIn 1943, probably suffering from cancer, she killed herself with gas from a domestic cooker.\n\n== Posthumous Recognition ==\n\nAlthough in her lifetime, Hastings was regarded as a relatively minor literary figure, more recently she has been praised for her innovative use of pseudonyms and her pioneering feminist views.\n\nWallace Martin mentions her in his seminal study of [[The New Age]], commenting that \u2018Beatrice Hastings displayed amazing versatility as reviewer, poet, and satirist; she was most effective, albeit unnecessarily malicious, in the last capacity.\u2019<ref>Wallace Martin, The New Age Under Orage: Chapters in English Cultural History (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1967), p.125.</ref> \n\nLiterary critic [[Robert Scholes]] has noted that \"Hastings, who was an important presence on the ''New Age'' editorial staff before the war, had an unhappy life that ended in suicide, never receiving the recognition as a writer that she sought.\"<ref>[[Robert Scholes|Scholes, Robert]]. (2008). ''Paradoxy of Modernism''. Yale University Press. p. 222. {{ISBN|978-0-300-10820-0}}</ref>\n\n==Theosophy==\n\nHastings was a convert to [[Theosophical Society|Theosophy]]. She attempted to defend [[Helena Blavatsky]] from charges of fraud and [[plagiarism]]. In 1937, she published two volumes entitled, ''Defence of Madame Blavatsky''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Gomes |first=Michael |title=Beatrice Hastings and the Defence of Madame Blavatsky |url=http://www.theosophycanada.com/files/hastings-solovyoff-fraud.pdf |accessdate=28 December 2017 |url-status= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228170602/http://www.theosophycanada.com/files/hastings-solovyoff-fraud.pdf |archivedate=28 December 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nHer writings on Theosophy have been criticized by [[Skepticism|skeptics]]. Biographer Peter Washington suggested that Hastings \"suffered from delusions of literary grandeur.\"<ref>Washington, Peter. (1995).

De Ferran however was sent to the back of the lead lap for hitting a tyre in the pit lane, putting him out of contention.
