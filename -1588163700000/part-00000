{"title_page": "USB hardware", "text_new": "{{short description|Communication connector using the USB protocol}}\n{{Use American English|date=May 2018}}\n{{broader|USB}}\n\nThis article provides information about the physical aspects of Universal Serial Bus, [[USB]]:  connectors, cabling, and power. The initial versions of the USB standard specified connectors that were easy to use and that would have acceptable life spans; revisions of the standard added smaller connectors useful for compact portable devices. Higher-speed development of the USB standard gave rise to another family of connectors to permit additional data paths. All versions of USB specify cable properties; version 3.X cables include additional data paths.  The USB standard included power supply to peripheral devices; modern versions of the standard extend the power delivery limits for battery charging and devices requiring up to 100 watts. USB has been selected as the standard charging format for many mobile phones, reducing the proliferation of proprietary chargers.\n\n== {{Anchor|CONNECTORS|connector}}Connectors ==\n[[File:USB 2.0 and 3.0 connectors.svg|thumb|490x490px|Comparison of USB connector plugs, excluding USB-C type plugs]]\nThe three sizes of USB connectors are the default or ''standard'' format intended for desktop or portable equipment, the ''mini'' intended for mobile equipment, and the thinner ''micro'' size, for low-profile mobile equipment such as mobile phones and tablets. There are five speeds for USB data transfer: Low Speed, Full Speed<!-- PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE TO 1.1; FS STARTED IN 1.0 -->, High Speed (from version 2.0 of the specification), [[SuperSpeed]] (from version 3.0), and SuperSpeed+ (from version 3.1). The modes have differing hardware and cabling requirements. USB devices have some choice of implemented modes, and USB version is not a reliable statement of implemented modes. Modes are identified by their names and icons, and the specification suggests that plugs and receptacles be colour-coded (SuperSpeed is identified by blue).\n\nUnlike other data buses (such as Ethernet), USB connections are directed; a  host device has \"downstream\" facing ports that connect to the \"upstream\" ports of devices. Only downstream facing ports provide power; this topology was chosen to easily prevent electrical overloads and damaged equipment. Thus, USB cables have different ends: A and B, with different physical connectors for each. Each format has a plug and receptacle defined for each of the A and B ends. USB cables have plugs, and the corresponding receptacles are on the computers or electronic devices. In common practice, the A end is usually the standard format, and the B side varies over standard, mini, and micro. The mini and micro formats also provide for [[USB On-The-Go]] with a hermaphroditic AB receptacle, which accepts either an A or a B plug. On-The-Go allows USB between peers without discarding the directed topology by choosing the host at connection time; it also allows one [[Jack (connector)|receptacle]] to perform double duty in [[Theory of constraints|space-constrained]] applications.\n\n=== Connector properties ===\n[[File:Male and Female USB Connectors.jpg|thumb|Type-A plug and, as part of a non-standard cable, receptacle]]\nThe connectors the USB committee specifies support a number of USB's underlying goals, and reflect lessons learned from the many connectors the computer industry has used. The female connector mounted on the host or device is called the ''receptacle'', and the male connector attached to the cable is called the ''plug''.<ref name=USB_3_0_spec>{{Cite book |others=Contributors: [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Intel]], [[Microsoft]], [[NEC]], [[ST-Ericsson]], [[Texas Instruments]] |title=Universal Serial Bus 3.0 Specification: Revision 1.0 |page=531 |date=6 June 2011  |url=http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/documents_archive/ |access-date=2019-04-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230035108/http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/documents_archive/ |archivedate=30 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The official USB specification documents also periodically define the term ''male'' to represent the plug, and ''female'' to represent the receptacle.<ref name=\"usb-ecn\">{{cite web |title=USB 2.0 Specification Engineering Change Notice (ECN) #1: Mini-B connector |via=www.usb.org |date=2000-10-20 |url=http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/ecn1.pdf |access-date=2019-04-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150412121600/http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/ecn1.pdf |archivedate=12 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nBy design, it is difficult to insert a USB plug into its receptacle incorrectly. The USB specification requires that the cable plug  and receptacle be marked so the user can recognize the proper orientation.<ref name=\"USB_3_0_spec\" /> The USB-C plug however is  reversible.  USB cables and small USB devices are held in place by the gripping force from the receptacle, with no screws, clips, or thumb-turns as other connectors use. Trees\n\nThe different A and B plugs prevent accidentally connecting two power sources. However, some of this directed topology is lost with the advent of multi-purpose USB connections (such as [[USB On-The-Go]] in smartphones, and USB-powered Wi-Fi routers), which require A-to-A, B-to-B, and sometimes Y/splitter cables. See the [[#USB On-The-Go connectors|USB On-The-Go connectors]] section below for a more detailed summary description.\n\nThere are cables with A plugs on both ends, which may be valid if the cable includes, for example, a USB host-to-host transfer device with 2 ports.<ref name=\"cablestogo\">{{cite web|title= USB connector guide|url= https://www.cablestogo.com/learning/connector-guides/usb|publisher= C2G|accessdate= 2013-12-02|url-status= live|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140421223137/http://www.cablestogo.com/learning/connector-guides/usb|archivedate= 21 April 2014|df= dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==== Durability ====\nThe standard connectors were designed to be more robust than many past connectors. This is because USB is [[Hot-swapping|hot-swappable]], and the connectors would be used more frequently, and perhaps with less care, than previous connectors.\n\nStandard USB has a minimum rated lifetime of 1,500 cycles of insertion and removal,<ref name=\"usb.org-cabconn\" /> the mini-USB receptacle increases this to 5,000 cycles,<ref name=\"usb.org-cabconn\" /> and the newer Micro-USB<ref name=\"usb.org-cabconn\" /> and USB-C receptacles are both designed for a minimum rated lifetime of 10,000 cycles of insertion and removal.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Howse|first1=Brett|title=USB Type-C Connector Specifications Finalized|url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/8377/usb-typec-connector-specifications-finalized|website=AnandTech|publisher=Anadtech|accessdate=24 April 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318004627/http://www.anandtech.com/show/8377/usb-typec-connector-specifications-finalized|archivedate=18 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> To accomplish this, a locking device was added and the leaf-spring was moved from the jack to the plug, so that the most-stressed part is on the cable side of the connection.

The shell is typically grounded, to dissipate static electricity and to shield the wires within the connector.\n\n==== Compatibility ====\nThe USB standard specifies tolerances for compliant USB connectors to minimize physical incompatibilities in connectors from different vendors. The USB specification also defines limits to the size of a connecting device in the area around its plug, so that adjacent ports are not blocked. Compliant devices must either fit within the size restrictions or support a compliant extension cable that does.\n\n==== Pinouts ====\n{{See also|USB 3.0#PINOUTS|l1=USB 3.0 \u00a7 Pinouts}}\n\nUSB 2.0 uses two wires for power (V<sub>BUS</sub> and GND), and two for [[differential signalling|differential serial data signals]].

The original USB specification detailed standard-A and standard-B plugs and receptacles. The connectors were different so that users could not connect one computer receptacle to another. The data pins in the standard plugs are recessed compared to the power pins, so that the device can power up before establishing a data connection. Some devices operate in different modes depending on whether the data connection is made.  Charging docks supply power and do not include a host device or data pins, allowing any capable USB device to charge or operate from a standard USB cable. Charging cables provide power connections, but not data. In a charge-only cable, the data wires are shorted at the device end, otherwise the device may reject the charger as unsuitable.\n\n==== {{Anchor|OVERMOLD-BOOT}}Standard connectors ====\n[[File:USB.svg|thumb|Pin configuration of type-A and type-B plugs, viewed end-on]]\n\n*The type-A plug.  This plug has an elongated rectangular cross-section, inserts into a type-A receptacle on a ''downstream port'' on a USB host or hub, and carries both power and data. Captive cables on USB devices, such as keyboards or mice, terminate with a type-A plug.\n*The type-B plug: This plug has a near square cross-section with the top exterior corners beveled. As part of a removable cable, it inserts into an ''upstream port'' on a device, such as a printer. On some devices, the type-B receptacle has no data connections, being used solely for accepting power from the upstream device. This two-connector-type scheme (A/B) prevents a user from accidentally creating a loop.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Quinnell |first=Richard A |title=USB: a neat package with a few loose ends |work=EDN Magazine |publisher=Reed |date=24 October 1996 |url=http://www.edn.com/design/systems-design/4351549/USB-a-neat-package-with-a-few-loose-end |accessdate=2013-02-18 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523185222/http://www.edn.com/design/systems-design/4351549/USB-a-neat-package-with-a-few-loose-end |archivedate=23 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=What is the Difference between USB Type A and USB Type B Plug/Connector?|url=http://digital.ni.com/public.nsf/allkb/0E543C70602423C486256DB8006208DE|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170207031653/http://digital.ni.com/public.nsf/allkb/0E543C70602423C486256DB8006208DE|archivedate=7 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n{{Anchor|OVERMOLD-BOOT}}\nThe maximum allowed cross-section of the ''overmold boot'' (which is part of the connector used for its handling) is {{convert|16|by|8|mm|abbr=on}} for the standard-A plug type, while for the type-B it is {{convert|11.5|by|10.5|mm|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"usb-ecn\"/>\n\n==== {{Anchor|MINI}}Mini connectors ====\n[[File:Mini usb AB.jpg|thumb|Mini-A (left) and Mini-B (right) plugs]]\n\nMini-USB connectors were introduced together with USB 2.0 in April 2000, for use with smaller devices such as [[digital camera]]s, [[smartphone]]s, and [[tablet computer]]s.

====\n[[File:Connector USB 3 IMGP6033 wp.jpg|thumb|right|USB 3.0 Micro-B SuperSpeed plug]]\n{{See also|USB 3.0#CONNECTORS|l1=USB 3.0 \u00a7 Connectors}}\n\nUSB 3.0 introduced Type-A SuperSpeed plugs and receptacles as well as micro-sized Type-B SuperSpeed plugs and receptacles. The 3.0 receptacles are backward-compatible with the corresponding pre-3.0 plugs.\n\nUSB 3.x and USB 1.x Type-A plugs and receptacles are designed to interoperate. To achieve USB&nbsp;3.0's SuperSpeed (and SuperSpeed+ for USB&nbsp;3.1&nbsp;Gen&nbsp;2), 5 extra pins are added to the unused area of the original 4 pin USB&nbsp;1.0 design, making USB&nbsp;3.0 Type-A plugs and receptacles backward compatible to those of USB&nbsp;1.0.\n\nOn the device side, a modified Micro-B plug (Micro-B SuperSpeed) is used to cater for the five additional pins required to achieve the USB 3.0 features (USB-C plug can also be used). The USB 3.0 Micro-B plug effectively consists of a standard USB 2.0 Micro-B cable plug, with an additional 5 pins plug \"stacked\" to the side of it. In this way, cables with smaller 5 pin USB 2.0 Micro-B plugs can be plugged into devices with 10 contact USB 3.0 Micro-B receptacles and achieve backward compatibility.\n\nUSB cables exist with various combinations of plugs on each end of the cable, as displayed below in the ''USB cables matrix''.\n[[File:USB-3.0-Stecker (Typ B).jpg|alt=USB 3.0 B type plug|thumb|USB 3.0 B type plug]]\n\n==== USB On-The-Go connectors ====\n{{Main|USB On-The-Go}}\n[[USB On-The-Go]] (OTG) introduces the concept of a device performing both master and slave roles. All current OTG devices are required to have one, and only one, USB connector: a Micro-AB receptacle. (In the past, before the development of Micro-USB, On-The-Go devices used ''Mini''-AB receptacles).\n\nThe Micro-AB receptacle is capable of accepting both Micro-A and Micro-B plugs, attached to any of the legal cables and adapters as defined in revision 1.01 of the Micro-USB specification.\n\nTo enable Type-AB receptacles to distinguish which end of a cable is plugged in, plugs have an \"ID\" pin in addition to the four contacts in standard-size USB connectors. This ID pin is connected to GND in Type-A plugs, and left unconnected in Type-B plugs. Typically, a [[pull-up resistor]] in the device is used to detect the presence or absence of an ID connection.\n\nThe OTG device with the A-plug inserted is called the A-device and is responsible for powering the USB interface when required, and by default assumes the role of host. The OTG device with the B-plug inserted is called the B-device and by default assumes the role of peripheral. An OTG device with no plug inserted defaults to acting as a B-device. If an application on the B-device requires the role of host, then the Host Negotiation Protocol (HNP) is used to temporarily transfer the host role to the B-device.\n\nOTG devices attached either to a peripheral-only B-device or a standard/embedded host have their role fixed by the cable, since in these scenarios it is only possible to attach the cable one way.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\n==== USB-C ====\n{{Anchor|TYPE-C}}\n[[File:USB Type-C icon.svg|thumb|The [[USB-C]] plug]]\n[[File:USB_Type-C_macbook.png|thumbnail|USB cable with a USB-C plug and a USB-C port on an [[MacBook (2015\u2013present)|Apple MacBook]] ]]\n{{Main|USB-C}}\n\nDeveloped at roughly the same time as the USB&nbsp;3.1 specification, but distinct from it, the USB-C Specification 1.0 was finalized in August 2014<ref name=\"Cfinalized\" /> and defines a new small reversible-plug connector for USB devices.<ref name=\"difference\">{{cite web | url=http://www.extremetech.com/computing/197145-reversible-usb-type-c-finally-on-its-way-alongside-usb-3-1s-10gbit-performance | title=USB-C vs. USB 3.1: What\u2019s the difference? | publisher=ExtremeTech | date=March 13, 2015 | accessdate=April 9, 2015 | author=Hruska, Joel | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150411081838/http://www.extremetech.com/computing/197145-reversible-usb-type-c-finally-on-its-way-alongside-usb-3-1s-10gbit-performance | archivedate=11 April 2015 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> The USB-C plug connects to both hosts and devices, replacing various Type-A and Type-B connectors and cables with a standard meant to be future-proof.<ref name=\"Cfinalized\">{{cite web |title=USB Type-C Connector Specifications Finalized |url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/8377/usb-typec-connector-specifications-finalized |last=Howse |first=Brett |date=August 12, 2014 |accessdate=December 28, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141228122529/http://www.anandtech.com/show/8377/usb-typec-connector-specifications-finalized |archivedate=28 December 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"ngo2014\">{{cite web |last1=Ngo |first1=Dong |title=USB Type-C: One Cable to Connect Them All|url= https://www.cnet.com/news/usb-type-c-one-cable-to-connect-them-all/ |date=22 August 2014 |website=c{{!}}net |accessdate=28 December 2014 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150307064003/http://www.cnet.com/news/usb-type-c-one-cable-to-connect-them-all |archivedate=2015-03-07}}</ref>\n\nThe 24-pin double-sided connector provides four power-ground pairs, two differential pairs for USB&nbsp;2.0 data bus (though only one pair is implemented in a USB-C cable), four pairs for SuperSpeed data bus (only two pairs are used in USB 3.1 mode), two \"sideband use\" pins, V<sub>CONN</sub> +5&nbsp;V power for active cables, and a configuration pin for cable orientation detection and dedicated [[biphase mark code]] (BMC) configuration data channel.<ref name=\"IDF14-TypeC\">{{cite web|url=https://intel.activeevents.com/sf14/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=1254 |title=Technical Introduction of the New USB Type-C Connector |accessdate=29 December 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141229123208/https://intel.activeevents.com/sf14/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=1254 |archivedate=29 December 2014 }}</ref><ref name=\"TypeC-DP1.3\">{{cite web |title=DisplayPort Alternate Mode for USB Type-C Announced - Video, Power, & Data All Over Type-C |url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/8558/displayport-alternate-mode-for-usb-typec-announced |last=Smith |first=Ryan |date=September 22, 2014 |website=[[AnandTech]] |accessdate=28 December 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218171152/http://www.anandtech.com/show/8558/displayport-alternate-mode-for-usb-typec-announced |archivedate=18 December 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Type-A and Type-B adaptors and cables are required for older devices to plug into USB-C hosts.

''Accessory charging adapters (ACA)'' are devices that provide portable charging power to an On-The-Go connection between host and peripheral.\n\nACAs have three ports: the OTG port for the portable device, which is required to have a Micro-A plug on a captive cable; the accessory port, which is required to have a Micro-AB or type-A receptacle; and the charging port, which is required to have a Micro-B receptacle, or type-A plug or charger on a captive cable. The ID pin of the OTG port is not connected within plug as usual, but to the ACA itself, where signals outside the OTG floating and ground states are used for ACA detection and state signaling. The charging port does not pass data, but does use the D\u00b1 signals for charging port detection. The accessory port acts as any other port. When appropriately signaled by the ACA, the portable device can charge from the bus power as if there were a charging port present; any OTG signals over bus power are instead passed to the portable device via the ID signal. Bus power is also provided to the accessory port from the charging port transparently.<ref name=\"USBBC1.2\" />\n\n=== {{Anchor|PD|PD-R1.0|PD-R1.0V1.1|PD-R1.0V1.2|PD-R2.0V1.0}}USB Power Delivery (USB PD) ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"text-align: left; border: none; margin: 1em auto 1em 1.5em;\"\n|+USB PD Rev. 1.0 source profiles<ref>{{cite web|title=PD_1.0|url=http://www.usb.org/developers/powerdelivery/PD_1.0_Introduction.pdf|accessdate=2016-04-27|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404052839/http://www.usb.org/developers/powerdelivery/PD_1.0_Introduction.pdf|archivedate=4 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n!

This is common for external hard and [[optical disc drive]]s, and generally for devices with [[electrical motor|motors]] or [[electrical lamp|lamps]]. Such devices can use an [[wall wart|external power supply]], which is allowed by the standard, or use a dual-input USB cable, one input of which is for power and data transfer, the other solely for power, which makes the device a non-standard USB device. Some USB ports and external hubs can, in practice, supply more power to USB devices than required by the specification but a standard-compliant device may not depend on this.\n\nIn addition to limiting the total average power used by the device, the USB specification limits the [[inrush current]] (i.e., the current used to charge decoupling and [[filter capacitor]]s) when the device is first connected. Otherwise, connecting a device could cause problems with the host's internal power. USB devices are also required to automatically enter ultra low-power suspend mode when the USB host is suspended. Nevertheless, many USB host interfaces do not cut off the power supply to USB devices when they are suspended.<ref>{{cite web|title=Part 2 - Electrical|url=http://www.usbmadesimple.co.uk/ums_2.htm|publisher=MQP Electronics Ltd|accessdate=2014-12-29|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224203350/http://www.usbmadesimple.co.uk/ums_2.htm|archivedate=24 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nSome non-standard USB devices use the 5&nbsp;V power supply without participating in a proper USB network, which negotiates power draw with the host interface.

The initial versions of the USB standard specified connectors that were easy to use and that would have acceptable life spans; revisions of the standard added smaller connectors useful for compact portable devices. Higher-speed development of the USB standard gave rise to another family of connectors to permit additional data paths. All versions of USB specify cable properties; version 3.X cables include additional data paths.  The USB standard included power supply to peripheral devices; modern versions of the standard extend the power delivery limits for battery charging and devices requiring up to 100 watts. USB has been selected as the standard charging format for many mobile phones, reducing the proliferation of proprietary chargers.\n\n== {{Anchor|CONNECTORS|connector}}Connectors ==\n[[File:USB 2.0 and 3.0 connectors.svg|thumb|490x490px|Comparison of USB connector plugs, excluding USB-C type plugs]]\nThe three sizes of USB connectors are the default or ''standard'' format intended for desktop or portable equipment, the ''mini'' intended for mobile equipment, and the thinner ''micro'' size, for low-profile mobile equipment such as mobile phones and tablets. There are five speeds for USB data transfer: Low Speed, Full Speed<!-- PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE TO 1.1; FS STARTED IN 1.0 -->, High Speed (from version 2.0 of the specification), [[SuperSpeed]] (from version 3.0), and SuperSpeed+ (from version 3.1). The modes have differing hardware and cabling requirements. USB devices have some choice of implemented modes, and USB version is not a reliable statement of implemented modes. Modes are identified by their names and icons, and the specification suggests that plugs and receptacles be colour-coded (SuperSpeed is identified by blue).\n\nUnlike other data buses (such as Ethernet), USB connections are directed; a  host device has \"downstream\" facing ports that connect to the \"upstream\" ports of devices. Only downstream facing ports provide power; this topology was chosen to easily prevent electrical overloads and damaged equipment. Thus, USB cables have different ends: A and B, with different physical connectors for each. Each format has a plug and receptacle defined for each of the A and B ends. USB cables have plugs, and the corresponding receptacles are on the computers or electronic devices. In common practice, the A end is usually the standard format, and the B side varies over standard, mini, and micro. The mini and micro formats also provide for [[USB On-The-Go]] with a hermaphroditic AB receptacle, which accepts either an A or a B plug. On-The-Go allows USB between peers without discarding the directed topology by choosing the host at connection time; it also allows one [[Jack (connector)|receptacle]] to perform double duty in [[Theory of constraints|space-constrained]] applications.\n\n=== Connector properties ===\n[[File:Male and Female USB Connectors.jpg|thumb|Type-A plug and, as part of a non-standard cable, receptacle]]\nThe connectors the USB committee specifies support a number of USB's underlying goals, and reflect lessons learned from the many connectors the computer industry has used. The female connector mounted on the host or device is called the ''receptacle'', and the male connector attached to the cable is called the ''plug''.<ref name=USB_3_0_spec>{{Cite book |others=Contributors: [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Intel]], [[Microsoft]], [[NEC]], [[ST-Ericsson]], [[Texas Instruments]] |title=Universal Serial Bus 3.0 Specification: Revision 1.0 |page=531 |date=6 June 2011  |url=http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/documents_archive/ |access-date=2019-04-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230035108/http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/documents_archive/ |archivedate=30 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The official USB specification documents also periodically define the term ''male'' to represent the plug, and ''female'' to represent the receptacle.<ref name=\"usb-ecn\">{{cite web |title=USB 2.0 Specification Engineering Change Notice (ECN) #1: Mini-B connector |via=www.usb.org |date=2000-10-20 |url=http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/ecn1.pdf |access-date=2019-04-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150412121600/http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/ecn1.pdf |archivedate=12 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nBy design, it is difficult to insert a USB plug into its receptacle incorrectly. The USB specification requires that the cable plug  and receptacle be marked so the user can recognize the proper orientation.<ref name=\"USB_3_0_spec\" /> The USB-C plug however is  reversible.  USB cables and small USB devices are held in place by the gripping force from the receptacle, with no screws, clips, or thumb-turns as other connectors use.\n\nThe different A and B plugs prevent accidentally connecting two power sources. However, some of this directed topology is lost with the advent of multi-purpose USB connections (such as [[USB On-The-Go]] in smartphones, and USB-powered Wi-Fi routers), which require A-to-A, B-to-B, and sometimes Y/splitter cables. See the [[#USB On-The-Go connectors|USB On-The-Go connectors]] section below for a more detailed summary description.\n\nThere are cables with A plugs on both ends, which may be valid if the cable includes, for example, a USB host-to-host transfer device with 2 ports.<ref name=\"cablestogo\">{{cite web|title= USB connector guide|url= https://www.cablestogo.com/learning/connector-guides/usb|publisher= C2G|accessdate= 2013-12-02|url-status= live|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140421223137/http://www.cablestogo.com/learning/connector-guides/usb|archivedate= 21 April 2014|df= dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==== Durability ====\nThe standard connectors were designed to be more robust than many past connectors. This is because USB is [[Hot-swapping|hot-swappable]], and the connectors would be used more frequently, and perhaps with less care, than previous connectors.\n\nStandard USB has a minimum rated lifetime of 1,500 cycles of insertion and removal,<ref name=\"usb.org-cabconn\" /> the mini-USB receptacle increases this to 5,000 cycles,<ref name=\"usb.org-cabconn\" /> and the newer Micro-USB<ref name=\"usb.org-cabconn\" /> and USB-C receptacles are both designed for a minimum rated lifetime of 10,000 cycles of insertion and removal.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Howse|first1=Brett|title=USB Type-C Connector Specifications Finalized|url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/8377/usb-typec-connector-specifications-finalized|website=AnandTech|publisher=Anadtech|accessdate=24 April 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318004627/http://www.anandtech.com/show/8377/usb-typec-connector-specifications-finalized|archivedate=18 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> To accomplish this, a locking device was added and the leaf-spring was moved from the jack to the plug, so that the most-stressed part is on the cable side of the connection.

The USB specification also defines limits to the size of a connecting device in the area around its plug, so that adjacent ports are not blocked. Compliant devices must either fit within the size restrictions or support a compliant extension cable that does.\n\n==== Pinouts ====\n{{See also|USB 3.0#PINOUTS|l1=USB 3.0 \u00a7 Pinouts}}\n\nUSB 2.0 uses two wires for power (V<sub>BUS</sub> and GND), and two for [[differential signalling|differential serial data signals]].

The original USB specification detailed standard-A and standard-B plugs and receptacles. The connectors were different so that users could not connect one computer receptacle to another. The data pins in the standard plugs are recessed compared to the power pins, so that the device can power up before establishing a data connection. Some devices operate in different modes depending on whether the data connection is made.  Charging docks supply power and do not include a host device or data pins, allowing any capable USB device to charge or operate from a standard USB cable. Charging cables provide power connections, but not data. In a charge-only cable, the data wires are shorted at the device end, otherwise the device may reject the charger as unsuitable.\n\n==== {{Anchor|OVERMOLD-BOOT}}Standard connectors ====\n[[File:USB.svg|thumb|Pin configuration of type-A and type-B plugs, viewed end-on]]\n\n*The type-A plug.  This plug has an elongated rectangular cross-section, inserts into a type-A receptacle on a ''downstream port'' on a USB host or hub, and carries both power and data. Captive cables on USB devices, such as keyboards or mice, terminate with a type-A plug.\n*The type-B plug: This plug has a near square cross-section with the top exterior corners beveled. As part of a removable cable, it inserts into an ''upstream port'' on a device, such as a printer. On some devices, the type-B receptacle has no data connections, being used solely for accepting power from the upstream device. This two-connector-type scheme (A/B) prevents a user from accidentally creating a loop.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Quinnell |first=Richard A |title=USB: a neat package with a few loose ends |work=EDN Magazine |publisher=Reed |date=24 October 1996 |url=http://www.edn.com/design/systems-design/4351549/USB-a-neat-package-with-a-few-loose-end |accessdate=2013-02-18 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523185222/http://www.edn.com/design/systems-design/4351549/USB-a-neat-package-with-a-few-loose-end |archivedate=23 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=What is the Difference between USB Type A and USB Type B Plug/Connector?|url=http://digital.ni.com/public.nsf/allkb/0E543C70602423C486256DB8006208DE|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170207031653/http://digital.ni.com/public.nsf/allkb/0E543C70602423C486256DB8006208DE|archivedate=7 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n{{Anchor|OVERMOLD-BOOT}}\nThe maximum allowed cross-section of the ''overmold boot'' (which is part of the connector used for its handling) is {{convert|16|by|8|mm|abbr=on}} for the standard-A plug type, while for the type-B it is {{convert|11.5|by|10.5|mm|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"usb-ecn\"/>\n\n==== {{Anchor|MINI}}Mini connectors ====\n[[File:Mini usb AB.jpg|thumb|Mini-A (left) and Mini-B (right) plugs]]\n\nMini-USB connectors were introduced together with USB 2.0 in April 2000, for use with smaller devices such as [[digital camera]]s, [[smartphone]]s, and [[tablet computer]]s.

====\n[[File:Connector USB 3 IMGP6033 wp.jpg|thumb|right|USB 3.0 Micro-B SuperSpeed plug]]\n{{See also|USB 3.0#CONNECTORS|l1=USB 3.0 \u00a7 Connectors}}\n\nUSB 3.0 introduced Type-A SuperSpeed plugs and receptacles as well as micro-sized Type-B SuperSpeed plugs and receptacles. The 3.0 receptacles are backward-compatible with the corresponding pre-3.0 plugs.\n\nUSB 3.x and USB 1.x Type-A plugs and receptacles are designed to interoperate. To achieve USB&nbsp;3.0's SuperSpeed (and SuperSpeed+ for USB&nbsp;3.1&nbsp;Gen&nbsp;2), 5 extra pins are added to the unused area of the original 4 pin USB&nbsp;1.0 design, making USB&nbsp;3.0 Type-A plugs and receptacles backward compatible to those of USB&nbsp;1.0.\n\nOn the device side, a modified Micro-B plug (Micro-B SuperSpeed) is used to cater for the five additional pins required to achieve the USB 3.0 features (USB-C plug can also be used). The USB 3.0 Micro-B plug effectively consists of a standard USB 2.0 Micro-B cable plug, with an additional 5 pins plug \"stacked\" to the side of it. In this way, cables with smaller 5 pin USB 2.0 Micro-B plugs can be plugged into devices with 10 contact USB 3.0 Micro-B receptacles and achieve backward compatibility.\n\nUSB cables exist with various combinations of plugs on each end of the cable, as displayed below in the ''USB cables matrix''.\n[[File:USB-3.0-Stecker (Typ B).jpg|alt=USB 3.0 B type plug|thumb|USB 3.0 B type plug]]\n\n==== USB On-The-Go connectors ====\n{{Main|USB On-The-Go}}\n[[USB On-The-Go]] (OTG) introduces the concept of a device performing both master and slave roles. All current OTG devices are required to have one, and only one, USB connector: a Micro-AB receptacle. (In the past, before the development of Micro-USB, On-The-Go devices used ''Mini''-AB receptacles).\n\nThe Micro-AB receptacle is capable of accepting both Micro-A and Micro-B plugs, attached to any of the legal cables and adapters as defined in revision 1.01 of the Micro-USB specification.\n\nTo enable Type-AB receptacles to distinguish which end of a cable is plugged in, plugs have an \"ID\" pin in addition to the four contacts in standard-size USB connectors. This ID pin is connected to GND in Type-A plugs, and left unconnected in Type-B plugs. Typically, a [[pull-up resistor]] in the device is used to detect the presence or absence of an ID connection.\n\nThe OTG device with the A-plug inserted is called the A-device and is responsible for powering the USB interface when required, and by default assumes the role of host. The OTG device with the B-plug inserted is called the B-device and by default assumes the role of peripheral. An OTG device with no plug inserted defaults to acting as a B-device. If an application on the B-device requires the role of host, then the Host Negotiation Protocol (HNP) is used to temporarily transfer the host role to the B-device.\n\nOTG devices attached either to a peripheral-only B-device or a standard/embedded host have their role fixed by the cable, since in these scenarios it is only possible to attach the cable one way.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\n==== USB-C ====\n{{Anchor|TYPE-C}}\n[[File:USB Type-C icon.svg|thumb|The [[USB-C]] plug]]\n[[File:USB_Type-C_macbook.png|thumbnail|USB cable with a USB-C plug and a USB-C port on an [[MacBook (2015\u2013present)|Apple MacBook]] ]]\n{{Main|USB-C}}\n\nDeveloped at roughly the same time as the USB&nbsp;3.1 specification, but distinct from it, the USB-C Specification 1.0 was finalized in August 2014<ref name=\"Cfinalized\" /> and defines a new small reversible-plug connector for USB devices.<ref name=\"difference\">{{cite web | url=http://www.extremetech.com/computing/197145-reversible-usb-type-c-finally-on-its-way-alongside-usb-3-1s-10gbit-performance | title=USB-C vs. USB 3.1: What\u2019s the difference? | publisher=ExtremeTech | date=March 13, 2015 | accessdate=April 9, 2015 | author=Hruska, Joel | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150411081838/http://www.extremetech.com/computing/197145-reversible-usb-type-c-finally-on-its-way-alongside-usb-3-1s-10gbit-performance | archivedate=11 April 2015 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> The USB-C plug connects to both hosts and devices, replacing various Type-A and Type-B connectors and cables with a standard meant to be future-proof.<ref name=\"Cfinalized\">{{cite web |title=USB Type-C Connector Specifications Finalized |url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/8377/usb-typec-connector-specifications-finalized |last=Howse |first=Brett |date=August 12, 2014 |accessdate=December 28, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141228122529/http://www.anandtech.com/show/8377/usb-typec-connector-specifications-finalized |archivedate=28 December 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"ngo2014\">{{cite web |last1=Ngo |first1=Dong |title=USB Type-C: One Cable to Connect Them All|url= https://www.cnet.com/news/usb-type-c-one-cable-to-connect-them-all/ |date=22 August 2014 |website=c{{!}}net |accessdate=28 December 2014 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150307064003/http://www.cnet.com/news/usb-type-c-one-cable-to-connect-them-all |archivedate=2015-03-07}}</ref>\n\nThe 24-pin double-sided connector provides four power-ground pairs, two differential pairs for USB&nbsp;2.0 data bus (though only one pair is implemented in a USB-C cable), four pairs for SuperSpeed data bus (only two pairs are used in USB 3.1 mode), two \"sideband use\" pins, V<sub>CONN</sub> +5&nbsp;V power for active cables, and a configuration pin for cable orientation detection and dedicated [[biphase mark code]] (BMC) configuration data channel.<ref name=\"IDF14-TypeC\">{{cite web|url=https://intel.activeevents.com/sf14/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=1254 |title=Technical Introduction of the New USB Type-C Connector |accessdate=29 December 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141229123208/https://intel.activeevents.com/sf14/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=1254 |archivedate=29 December 2014 }}</ref><ref name=\"TypeC-DP1.3\">{{cite web |title=DisplayPort Alternate Mode for USB Type-C Announced - Video, Power, & Data All Over Type-C |url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/8558/displayport-alternate-mode-for-usb-typec-announced |last=Smith |first=Ryan |date=September 22, 2014 |website=[[AnandTech]] |accessdate=28 December 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218171152/http://www.anandtech.com/show/8558/displayport-alternate-mode-for-usb-typec-announced |archivedate=18 December 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Type-A and Type-B adaptors and cables are required for older devices to plug into USB-C hosts.

''Accessory charging adapters (ACA)'' are devices that provide portable charging power to an On-The-Go connection between host and peripheral.\n\nACAs have three ports: the OTG port for the portable device, which is required to have a Micro-A plug on a captive cable; the accessory port, which is required to have a Micro-AB or type-A receptacle; and the charging port, which is required to have a Micro-B receptacle, or type-A plug or charger on a captive cable. The ID pin of the OTG port is not connected within plug as usual, but to the ACA itself, where signals outside the OTG floating and ground states are used for ACA detection and state signaling. The charging port does not pass data, but does use the D\u00b1 signals for charging port detection. The accessory port acts as any other port.

This is common for external hard and [[optical disc drive]]s, and generally for devices with [[electrical motor|motors]] or [[electrical lamp|lamps]]. Such devices can use an [[wall wart|external power supply]], which is allowed by the standard, or use a dual-input USB cable, one input of which is for power and data transfer, the other solely for power, which makes the device a non-standard USB device. Some USB ports and external hubs can, in practice, supply more power to USB devices than required by the specification but a standard-compliant device may not depend on this.\n\nIn addition to limiting the total average power used by the device, the USB specification limits the [[inrush current]] (i.e., the current used to charge decoupling and [[filter capacitor]]s) when the device is first connected. Otherwise, connecting a device could cause problems with the host's internal power. USB devices are also required to automatically enter ultra low-power suspend mode when the USB host is suspended. Nevertheless, many USB host interfaces do not cut off the power supply to USB devices when they are suspended.<ref>{{cite web|title=Part 2 - Electrical|url=http://www.usbmadesimple.co.uk/ums_2.htm|publisher=MQP Electronics Ltd|accessdate=2014-12-29|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224203350/http://www.usbmadesimple.co.uk/ums_2.htm|archivedate=24 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nSome non-standard USB devices use the 5&nbsp;V power supply without participating in a proper USB network, which negotiates power draw with the host interface.

In most cases, these items contain no digital circuitry, and thus are not standard-compliant USB devices. This may cause problems with some computers, such as drawing too much current and damaging circuitry. Prior to the USB Battery Charging Specification, the USB specification required that devices connect in a low-power mode (100&nbsp;mA maximum) and communicate their current requirements to the host, which then permits the device to switch into high-power mode.\n\nSome devices, when plugged into charging ports, draw even more power (10&nbsp;watts at 2.1&nbsp;amperes) than the Battery Charging Specification allows \u2014 The [[iPad]] is one such device;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/watt_to_know_about_iphone_ipad_power_adapters/ |title=Watt to Know About iPhone & iPad Power Adapters &#124; Analysis |publisher=The Mac Observer |date= |accessdate=2011-12-12 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111210104210/http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/watt_to_know_about_iphone_ipad_power_adapters/ |archivedate=10 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> it negotiates the current pull with data pin voltages.<ref name=icharge/> [[Barnes & Noble]] [[Nook Color]] devices also require a special charger that runs at 1.9&nbsp;amperes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bookclubs.barnesandnoble.com/t5/NOOK-Color-General-Discussion/Nook-Color-charger-uses-special-micro-USB-connector/td-p/1093812 |title=Nook Color charger uses special Micro-USB connector |publisher=barnesandnoble.com |date=2011-07-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211135735/http://bookclubs.barnesandnoble.com/t5/NOOK-Color-General-Discussion/Nook-Color-charger-uses-special-micro-USB-connector/td-p/1093812 |archivedate=11 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== PoweredUSB ===\n{{Main|PoweredUSB}}\n[[PoweredUSB]] is a proprietary extension that adds four additional pins supplying up to 6&nbsp;A at 5&nbsp;V, 12&nbsp;V, or 24&nbsp;V.

Still, it performed slightly better than what most polls had predicted, despite falling eight seats short of the absolute majority they had set as an objective. The PP plummeted to just 33 seats after scoring its best ever result in the 2012 election, suffering the burden of PM [[Mariano Rajoy]]'s governance in the [[Government of Spain|Spanish Government]]. This represented the party's worst result at a regional election in Andalusia since the [[1990 Andalusian regional election|1990 election]], falling below 30% of the vote. The main beneficiaries of the election were parties alternative to the considered \"traditional\" ones \u2014 Podemos and Citizens, both of them, despite polling slightly lower than what early polls predicted, winning seats for the first time in the Parliament of Andalusia.\n\nThe post-election scenario, however, turned more difficult than what was originally expected.<ref>{{cite news |date=26 March 2015 |url=https://www.lavanguardia.com/pr/local/sevilla/20150326/54428462143/oposicion-bloquear-investidura-diaz.html |title=La oposici\u00f3n amenaza con bloquear la investidura de D\u00edaz hasta el final |language=Spanish |newspaper=[[La Vanguardia]] |access-date=3 February 2020}}</ref> IU collapse from 12 to 5 seats turned it into a minority force in the new parliament, preventing the PSOE from attempting a renewal of the 2012\u20132015 coalition\u2014a scenario which IU itself refused, due to the abrupt dissolution of the previous agreement.<ref name=\"ED250315\"/><ref>{{cite news |date=26 March 2015 |url=http://sevilla.abc.es/elecciones/andalucia/20150326/sevi-izquierda-unida-investidura-201503261910.html |title=Izquierda Unida niega su voto a Susana D\u00edaz porque \u00abcarece de credibilidad\u00bb |language=Spanish |newspaper=ABC |access-date=3 February 2020}}</ref> The PP, initially widely expected to abstain in Susana D\u00edaz's investiture voting in order to allow \"a government of the most-voted party\", announced instead that it would vote ''against'' D\u00edaz's investiture.<ref name=\"EC240315\"/><ref>{{cite news |date=24 March 2015 |url=http://ccaa.elpais.com/ccaa/2015/03/24/andalucia/1427217939_062933.html |title=El PP anuncia ahora que votar\u00e1 en contra de la investidura de D\u00edaz |language=Spanish |newspaper=El Pa\u00eds |access-date=3 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Government formation===\n{{Further|Second Susana D\u00edaz government}}\nNewcomers Podemos and Citizens became decisive in the election of any future cabinet, yet remained reluctant to support a new PSOE government.

Still, it performed slightly better than what most polls had predicted, despite falling eight seats short of the absolute majority they had set as an objective. The PP plummeted to just 33 seats after scoring its best ever result in the 2012 election, suffering the burden of PM [[Mariano Rajoy]]'s governance in the [[Government of Spain|Spanish Government]].

The manga storyline is somewhat self-referential, as several asides show that the characters are fully aware that they exist in a manga. Yukie Nasu appears frequently as herself, usually with a capital \"N\" on her head, to explain away certain loose plot threads.  For example, in a story featuring a [[baseball]] game taking place in late autumn, one of the characters asked why they weren't playing soccer; Nasu's character appeared and explained that she didn't know the rules for soccer.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter suffering from a series of mishaps, Kazuya Hasekawa has finally entered Ryokuto Academy. He is there to get away from his brother and his wife (whom Kazuya had a crush on). Unfortunately, he is assigned to live in the dorm known as Greenwood, a former insane asylum, where the weird students live. His roommate, Shun Kisaragi, looks just like a girl, and Kazuya initially thought he was until he saw Shun in the boys' bathroom. Also there are his next-door roommates, the dorm president Mitsuru Ikeda and his best friend, Shinobu Tezuka. The manga follows the everyday events and antics of Greenwood.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main characters===\n*{{Nihongo|'''Kazuya Hasukawa'''|\u84ee\u5ddd \u4e00\u4e5f}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Nozomu Sasaki]]|[[Ted Lewis (voice actor)|Ted Lewis]] (TAJ dub), [[Johnny Yong Bosch|Kevin Hatcher]] (Bang Zoom! dub)}}\n: Kazuya was raised by his older brother, Kazuhiro, after the death of their parents when they were younger. Kazuya had applied to enter to Ryokuto Academy so he could be just like Kazuhiro. Kazuya had fallen in love with Sumire, his tutor and was heartbroken when she fell in love with Kazuhiro and subsequently married him. Kazuya had lost respect for his brother since then and moved into the dorm to get away from them. Unfortunately, Kazuya suffered injuries due to a car accident, an ulcer and other mishaps that had delayed him from entering the academy. Much to his dismay, he has to deal with the craziness in the Greenwood dorm and the fact that Kazuhiro is the school nurse. Eventually, he gets used to living in the dorm and is voted president of the dorm by Mitsuru.

Although Kisaragi resembles a cute, tomboyish girl, he's actually a guy. Shun is the oldest son of the Kisaragi family, who run a chain of traditional Japanese inns. The females in the Kisaragi family inherit the company, but it has no connection with Shun's girlish figure. Surprisingly, Shun is heterosexual and dated a girl in junior high. Shun is very self-confident and proud of his beautiful long hair, and he knows he is so cute. Because he thinks it is the best way to be cool, he does not hesitate to dress like a girl. He can makes sound decisions and is a man of action, and no character believes that Shun is actually feminine.

He also has an unusual ability: His face is able to heal any cut or bruise in under a minute. All that rough treatment on Kazuya, however, is merely his way of toughening up Kazuya so he can take Mitsuru's place as Residence Hall President. Also, he tries his best to stay away from his adopted family.

He wishes to be the warrior that Celty chooses, but in order to do so, he needs to start a war that only he can win.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 12.5\n| Title               = Heaven's Vengeance\n| TranslitTitle       = Tenm\u014dkaikai\n| NativeTitle         = \u5929\u7db2\u6062\u6062\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = Yui Umemoto\n| WrittenBy           = Sadayuki Murai\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|DVD Extra Episode}}\n| AltDate             = September 17, 2011<ref name=\"sixthchedule\"/>\n| ShortSummary        = Tom comes to a couple's apartment to collect debt from a man named Ginjiro.

He wishes to be the warrior that Celty chooses, but in order to do so, he needs to start a war that only he can win.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 12.5\n| Title               = Heaven's Vengeance\n| TranslitTitle       = Tenm\u014dkaikai\n| NativeTitle         = \u5929\u7db2\u6062\u6062\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| DirectedBy          = Yui Umemoto\n| WrittenBy           = Sadayuki Murai\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|DVD Extra Episode}}\n| AltDate             = September 17, 2011<ref name=\"sixthchedule\"/>\n| ShortSummary        = Tom comes to a couple's apartment to collect debt from a man named Ginjiro.

Someone issues a death threat to Kasuka. When he approaches Kasuka with a knife, Shizuo throws a billboard sign at him, knocking him out. Izaya reveals to Shizuo that the person threatening Kasuka was recently dumped by his girlfriend, a fan of Kasuka, and that he convinced himself that Kasuka stole her from him. Izaya also reveals that he leaked Kasuka's schedule to him, and that he warned Shizuo about him. The two start attacking each other, and are caught on camera. Several gang members, who were previously attacked by Shizuo, see Shizuo on TV, and they see this as an opportunity to get revenge.

It has produced over 300 films in [[Tamil cinema|Tamil]], [[Cinema of Andhra Pradesh|Telugu]], [[Cinema of Karnataka|Kannada]], [[Malayalam Cinema|Malayalam]] and [[Bollywood|Hindi]] cinema.<ref name=\"dolby.com\" /> AVM has introduced numerous actors in Southern industries, some of the prominent actors are [[Sivaji Ganesan]], [[Rajkumar (actor)|Rajkumar]], [[S. S. Rajendran]], [[Vyjayanthimala]], [[Kamal Haasan]] and many more. The AVM Studios besides the shooting floors, has recording, dubbing and a preview theatre. The complex also houses facilities for production and post production processing.<ref name=\"dolby.com\" />\n\n== Early history ==\nBorn on 28 July 1907, Avichi Meiyappan hailed from a Nattukottai [[Nagarathar]] family of [[Karaikudi|Karaikkudi]] in Tamil Nadu. Avichi [[Chettiar]] ran a mini-department store, named AV & Sons. It sold gramophone records. Meiyappan, who joined his father's shop even as a teenager, decided to produce gramophone records instead of merely marketing them. He came to Madras where along with friends K. S. Narayana Iyengar, Subbaiah [[Chettiar]] and others promoted Saraswathi Stores. He found excellent support in K. P. Varadachari, its manager, and his lawyer friend Thoothukudi Govindachari Raghavachari he produced many records.\n\n=== Maiden venture ===\n[[File:AVM Studios Globe.jpg|thumb|Globe at the AVM Studios in Chennai]]\nThe dawn of the talkie era (1931) inspired Meiyappan to start Saraswathi Sound Productions and he launched his maiden movie venture, Alli Arjuna a Hindu mythology based movie. The film was shot in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] and proved a total flop as the one that followed named [[Ratnavali]]. At this point, an aspiring amateur actor and college graduate A. T. Krishnaswamy joined the unit as assistant director who was associated with Meiyappan for nearly a decade and wrote and directed the early AVM productions.\n\nThe reverses forced Meiyappan to lie low but only for a while. In association with Jayanthilal, a cinema house owner based in [[Bangalore]], he promoted a new company [[Pragati Pictures Limited]]. Grabbing an opportunity that came his way, AVM made [[Nandakumar (film)|Nandakumar]], Tamil version of a Marathi film launching it as a Pragati production. The highlight of this movie was the debut of [[T. R. Mahalingam (actor)|T. R. Mahalingam]] in to Tamil movie Industry.\n\nThe film was a landmark because for the first time playback singing was tried, with [[Lalitha Venkatraman]] singing for the actor who played Devaki. Meiyappan took the sprawling Club House off Mount Road on lease and shot scenes without going to studios and erecting sets. Soon after he shifted his unit to another sprawling edifice known as [[Admiralty House (Adyer)|Admiralty House]] in Adyar.\n[[File:AVM Studios workers, Chennai.jpg|thumb|Creating a set in AVM Studio, Chennai]]\n\n=== Success ===\n[[File:AVM Productions Logo.jpeg|thumb|Diamond Jubilee year of AVM Productions]]\nIn 1940, Meiyappan produced ''[[Bhookailas (1940 film)|Bhoo Kailas]]'', a mythological film which created history. The film was made in Telugu, its lead players were from Telugu cinema and it was directed by [[Sundar Rao Nadkarni]], a Mangalorean who had his training in Bombay. The film turned out to be a big hit and also won critical acclaim! Meiyappan struck gold with comedy next. ''[[Sabapathy (1941 film)|Sabapathy]]'' (1941) with the saucer-eyed [[T. R. Ramachandran]] in the lead, along with [[Kali N. Rathnam]] and [[K. Sarangapani]] was a runaway success. Then came a series of hits like [[En Manaivi]], [[Harishchandra]] (1943), [[Sri Valli (1945 film)|Sri Valli]].\n\nThe city of [[Madras]] began to feel the strains of the [[World War II]] raging on elsewhere and to reduce the exposure from Japanese bombing, Meiyappan moved his facilities to [[Karaikudi]]. In the outskirts of the town karaikudi he occupied a drama auditorium with a large open area around it on long lease and erected a studio. Thus was born AVM Productions with [[AVM Studios]].\n\nHits like [[Nam Iruvar]] (1947), [[Andha Naal]] (1954), and the National Award-winning [[Hum Panchi Ek Daal Ke]] (1957) followed.\n\nMeiyappan died on 12 August 1979, and after his demise his sons took over the mantle.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2006072802680100.htm&date=2006%2F07%2F28%2F&prd=fr& |title=Archived copy |access-date=14 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606112337/http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2006072802680100.htm&date=2006%2F07%2F28%2F&prd=fr& |archive-date=6 June 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, AVM produced ''[[Sivaji (film)|Sivaji]]'' which at {{INR}} 95 crore, was said to be the most expensive film ever made in the history of the Indian film industry at that time.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-06-15/news-interviews/27984040_1_sivaji-avm-productions-rajnikant | work=The Times Of India | title=World's a stage for Rajnikant \u2013 The Times of India | date=2007-06-15}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, AVM led by Aruna Guhan and Aparna Guhan started producing films to be screened only on the net.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/Age-old-AVM-to-venture-into-NET-flicks/2013/11/23/article1905558.ece|title=Age-old AVM to venture into NET-flicks|work=The New Indian Express}}</ref> Their first such production was a 55-minute-film, titled ''Idhuvum Kadandhu Pogum''.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/entering-the-internet-fray/article5383291.ece?homepage=true | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | first=Malathi | last=Rangarajan | title=Entering the Internet fray | date=2013-11-23}}</ref>\n\n== Filmography ==\n;Films\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Title{{efn|Films are listed in the order of their release date.}}\n! scope=\"col\" | Cast\n! scope=\"col\" | Director\n! scope=\"col\" | Language\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Notes\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | {{Tooltip|Ref.|Reference(s)}}\n|-\n| 2014\n| [[Idhuvum Kadandhu Pogum]]\n| Sivaji Dev, Anusha Varma\n| Anil Krishnan<br />Srihari Prabhakaran\n| Tamil\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | \n|-\n| 2011 || [[Mudhal Idam]] || Vidharth, Kavitha Nair and other actors\n| R.

It has produced over 300 films in [[Tamil cinema|Tamil]], [[Cinema of Andhra Pradesh|Telugu]], [[Cinema of Karnataka|Kannada]], [[Malayalam Cinema|Malayalam]] and [[Bollywood|Hindi]] cinema.<ref name=\"dolby.com\" /> AVM has introduced numerous actors in Southern industries, some of the prominent actors are [[Sivaji Ganesan]], [[Rajkumar (actor)|Rajkumar]], [[S. S. Rajendran]], [[Vyjayanthimala]], [[Kamal Haasan]] and many more. The AVM Studios besides the shooting floors, has recording, dubbing and a preview theatre. The complex also houses facilities for production and post production processing.<ref name=\"dolby.com\" />\n\n== Early history ==\nBorn on 28 July 1907, Avichi Meiyappan hailed from a Nattukottai [[Nagarathar]] family of [[Karaikudi|Karaikkudi]] in Tamil Nadu. Avichi [[Chettiar]] ran a mini-department store, named AV & Sons. It sold gramophone records. Meiyappan, who joined his father's shop even as a teenager, decided to produce gramophone records instead of merely marketing them. He came to Madras where along with friends K. S. Narayana Iyengar, Subbaiah [[Chettiar]] and others promoted Saraswathi Stores. He found excellent support in K. P. Varadachari, its manager, and his lawyer friend Thoothukudi Govindachari Raghavachari he produced many records.\n\n=== Maiden venture ===\n[[File:AVM Studios Globe.jpg|thumb|Globe at the AVM Studios in Chennai]]\nThe dawn of the talkie era (1931) inspired Meiyappan to start Saraswathi Sound Productions and he launched his maiden movie venture, Alli Arjuna a Hindu mythology based movie. The film was shot in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] and proved a total flop as the one that followed named [[Ratnavali]]. At this point, an aspiring amateur actor and college graduate A. T. Krishnaswamy joined the unit as assistant director who was associated with Meiyappan for nearly a decade and wrote and directed the early AVM productions.\n\nThe reverses forced Meiyappan to lie low but only for a while. In association with Jayanthilal, a cinema house owner based in [[Bangalore]], he promoted a new company [[Pragati Pictures Limited]]. Grabbing an opportunity that came his way, AVM made [[Nandakumar (film)|Nandakumar]], Tamil version of a Marathi film launching it as a Pragati production. The highlight of this movie was the debut of [[T. R. Mahalingam (actor)|T. R. Mahalingam]] in to Tamil movie Industry.\n\nThe film was a landmark because for the first time playback singing was tried, with [[Lalitha Venkatraman]] singing for the actor who played Devaki. Meiyappan took the sprawling Club House off Mount Road on lease and shot scenes without going to studios and erecting sets. Soon after he shifted his unit to another sprawling edifice known as [[Admiralty House (Adyer)|Admiralty House]] in Adyar.\n[[File:AVM Studios workers, Chennai.jpg|thumb|Creating a set in AVM Studio, Chennai]]\n\n=== Success ===\n[[File:AVM Productions Logo.jpeg|thumb|Diamond Jubilee year of AVM Productions]]\nIn 1940, Meiyappan produced ''[[Bhookailas (1940 film)|Bhoo Kailas]]'', a mythological film which created history. The film was made in Telugu, its lead players were from Telugu cinema and it was directed by [[Sundar Rao Nadkarni]], a Mangalorean who had his training in Bombay. The film turned out to be a big hit and also won critical acclaim! Meiyappan struck gold with comedy next. ''[[Sabapathy (1941 film)|Sabapathy]]'' (1941) with the saucer-eyed [[T. R. Ramachandran]] in the lead, along with [[Kali N. Rathnam]] and [[K. Sarangapani]] was a runaway success. Then came a series of hits like [[En Manaivi]], [[Harishchandra]] (1943), [[Sri Valli (1945 film)|Sri Valli]].\n\nThe city of [[Madras]] began to feel the strains of the [[World War II]] raging on elsewhere and to reduce the exposure from Japanese bombing, Meiyappan moved his facilities to [[Karaikudi]]. In the outskirts of the town karaikudi he occupied a drama auditorium with a large open area around it on long lease and erected a studio. Thus was born AVM Productions with [[AVM Studios]].\n\nHits like [[Nam Iruvar]] (1947), [[Andha Naal]] (1954), and the National Award-winning [[Hum Panchi Ek Daal Ke]] (1957) followed.\n\nMeiyappan died on 12 August 1979, and after his demise his sons took over the mantle.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2006072802680100.htm&date=2006%2F07%2F28%2F&prd=fr& |title=Archived copy |access-date=14 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606112337/http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2006072802680100.htm&date=2006%2F07%2F28%2F&prd=fr& |archive-date=6 June 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, AVM produced ''[[Sivaji (film)|Sivaji]]'' which at {{INR}} 95 crore, was said to be the most expensive film ever made in the history of the Indian film industry at that time.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-06-15/news-interviews/27984040_1_sivaji-avm-productions-rajnikant | work=The Times Of India | title=World's a stage for Rajnikant \u2013 The Times of India | date=2007-06-15}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, AVM led by Aruna Guhan and Aparna Guhan started producing films to be screened only on the net.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/Age-old-AVM-to-venture-into-NET-flicks/2013/11/23/article1905558.ece|title=Age-old AVM to venture into NET-flicks|work=The New Indian Express}}</ref> Their first such production was a 55-minute-film, titled ''Idhuvum Kadandhu Pogum''.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/entering-the-internet-fray/article5383291.ece?homepage=true | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | first=Malathi | last=Rangarajan | title=Entering the Internet fray | date=2013-11-23}}</ref>\n\n== Filmography ==\n;Films\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Title{{efn|Films are listed in the order of their release date.}}\n! scope=\"col\" | Cast\n! scope=\"col\" | Director\n! scope=\"col\" | Language\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Notes\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | {{Tooltip|Ref.|Reference(s)}}\n|-\n| 2014\n| [[Idhuvum Kadandhu Pogum]]\n| Sivaji Dev, Anusha Varma\n| Anil Krishnan<br />Srihari Prabhakaran\n| Tamil\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | \n|-\n| 2011 || [[Mudhal Idam]] || Vidharth, Kavitha Nair and other actors\n| R.

As a member of the Hashemite dynasty, the royal family of Jordan since 1921, Abdullah claims to be a 41st-generation direct descendant of [[Muhammad]].\n\nAbdullah was born in [[Amman]] as the first child of [[King Hussein]] and his second wife, British-born [[Princess Muna]]. As the King's eldest son, Abdullah was heir apparent until Hussein transferred the title to Abdullah's uncle, [[Prince Hassan bin Talal|Prince Hassan]], in 1965. Abdullah began his schooling in Amman, continuing his education abroad. He began his military career in 1980 as a training officer in the [[Jordanian Armed Forces]], later assuming command of the country's [[Joint Special Operations Command (Jordan)|Special Forces]] in 1994, and he became a major general in 1998. In 1993 Abdullah married [[Rania Al-Yassin]] (of Palestinian descent), and they have four children: [[Hussein, Crown Prince of Jordan|Crown Prince Hussein]], [[Princess Iman bint Abdullah|Princess Iman]], [[Princess Salma bint Abdullah|Princess Salma]] and [[Prince Hashem bin Abdullah|Prince Hashem]]. A few weeks before his death in 1999, Hussein named Abdullah his heir, and Abdullah succeeded his father.\n\nAbdullah, a [[constitutional monarch]], liberalized the economy when he assumed the throne, and his reforms led to an economic boom which continued until 2008. During the following years [[Jordan's economy]] experienced hardship as it dealt with the effects of the [[Great Recession]] and spillover from the [[Arab Spring]], including a cut in its petroleum supply and the collapse of trade with neighboring countries. In 2011, large-scale protests demanding reform erupted in the [[Arab world]]. Many of the protests led to civil wars in other countries, but Abdullah responded quickly to domestic unrest by replacing the government and introducing reforms to the constitution and laws governing public freedoms and elections. [[Proportional representation]] was introduced to the [[Jordanian parliament]] in the [[2016 Jordanian general election|2016 general election]], a move which he said would eventually lead to establishing [[parliamentary government]]s. The reforms took place amid unprecedented challenges stemming from regional instability, including an influx of 1.4 million Syrian refugees into the natural resources-lacking country and the emergence of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL).\n\nAbdullah is popular locally and internationally for maintaining Jordanian stability, and is known for promoting [[interfaith dialogue]] and a moderate understanding of [[Islam]]. The third-longest-serving Arab leader, he was regarded by the [[Royal Islamic Strategic Studies Centre]] as [[The 500 Most Influential Muslims|the most influential Muslim in the world]] in 2016.<ref

January 1962) has been [[King of Jordan|King]] of [[Jordan]] since 1999. As a member of the Hashemite dynasty, the royal family of Jordan since 1921, Abdullah claims to be a 41st-generation direct descendant of [[Muhammad]].\n\nAbdullah was born in [[Amman]] as the first child of [[King Hussein]] and his second wife, British-born [[Princess Muna]]. As the King's eldest son, Abdullah was heir apparent until Hussein transferred the title to Abdullah's uncle, [[Prince Hassan bin Talal|Prince Hassan]], in 1965. Abdullah began his schooling in Amman, continuing his education abroad. He began his military career in 1980 as a training officer in the [[Jordanian Armed Forces]], later assuming command of the country's [[Joint Special Operations Command (Jordan)|Special Forces]] in 1994, and he became a major general in 1998. In 1993 Abdullah married [[Rania Al-Yassin]] (of Palestinian descent), and they have four children: [[Hussein, Crown Prince of Jordan|Crown Prince Hussein]], [[Princess Iman bint Abdullah|Princess Iman]], [[Princess Salma bint Abdullah|Princess Salma]] and [[Prince Hashem bin Abdullah|Prince Hashem]]. A few weeks before his death in 1999, Hussein named Abdullah his heir, and Abdullah succeeded his father.\n\nAbdullah, a [[constitutional monarch]], liberalized the economy when he assumed the throne, and his reforms led to an economic boom which continued until 2008. During the following years [[Jordan's economy]] experienced hardship as it dealt with the effects of the [[Great Recession]] and spillover from the [[Arab Spring]], including a cut in its petroleum supply and the collapse of trade with neighboring countries. In 2011, large-scale protests demanding reform erupted in the [[Arab world]]. Many of the protests led to civil wars in other countries, but Abdullah responded quickly to domestic unrest by replacing the government and introducing reforms to the constitution and laws governing public freedoms and elections. [[Proportional representation]] was introduced to the [[Jordanian parliament]] in the [[2016 Jordanian general election|2016 general election]], a move which he said would eventually lead to establishing [[parliamentary government]]s. The reforms took place amid unprecedented challenges stemming from regional instability, including an influx of 1.4 million Syrian refugees into the natural resources-lacking country and the emergence of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL).\n\nAbdullah is popular locally and internationally for maintaining Jordanian stability, and is known for promoting [[interfaith dialogue]] and a moderate understanding of [[Islam]]. The third-longest-serving Arab leader, he was regarded by the [[Royal Islamic Strategic Studies Centre]] as [[The 500 Most Influential Muslims|the most influential Muslim in the world]] in 2016.<ref

Bangladeshi Americans are well represented in the fields of medicine, engineering, business, finance and information technology. Bangladeshi Americans have brought [[Bengali cuisine]] to the United States, and Bengali cuisine has been established as one of the most popular cuisines in the country with hundreds of Bengali restaurants in each major city {{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} and several similar eateries in smaller cities and towns. There are many Bangladeshi markets and stores in the United States.  Some of the largest are in New York City, [[Paterson, New Jersey]], [[Central New Jersey]], Washington, D.C., Atlantic City, and Los Angeles.\n\n===Languages===\nBangladeshi Americans often retain their native language [[Bengali language|Bengali]] and run many programs to nourish their mother tongue. However, many also speak Bengali dialects or other languages related to Bengali, the most common being [[Sylheti]] which is spoken by people from the [[Sylhet Division]] in Bangladesh, and [[Chatgaya]] which is spoken by Bangladeshis from [[Chittagong]].\n\n===Religion===\n\nBefore the [[colonization]] of India by [[Great Britain]], [[folk religion]] across the [[Bengal]] region incorporated elements of [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Islam]] to varying degrees. By the time of the [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|Partition of Bengal]], Bengalis began to classify themselves with one religion or another. Today, the vast majority of Bangladeshi American Muslims nominally subscribe to [[Sunni Islam]]. In smaller towns in America, Bangladeshi Americans will pray at home and make trips to attend their mosque or temple during major holidays. In major cities, Bangladeshi Americans who are Muslim hold religious services in their own mosques. There are also a number of major Hindu temples in the United States where Bangladeshi Americans play an important part in the leadership of their congregations. Due to the legacy of [[Buddhism]] as well as the [[Bengal Renaissance]], many Bangladeshi Americans continue traditions of [[humanism]] and identify as non-religious, secularist, [[atheist]], [[agnostic]] and [[gnostic]].\n\n<!-- PLEASE RESPECT ALPHABETICAL ORDER -->\n\n==Notable people==\n{{Main list|List of Bangladeshi Americans}}\n[[File:Dr. Omar Ishrak.jpg|right|upright|thumb|[[Omar Ishrak]] - Chairman of [[Intel]] and [[Medtronic]]]]\n[[File:Sears Tower ss.jpg|right|upright|thumb|[[Sears Tower]] (now Willis Tower), was designed by [[Fazlur Rahman Khan]].

Bangladeshi Americans are well represented in the fields of medicine, engineering, business, finance and information technology. Bangladeshi Americans have brought [[Bengali cuisine]] to the United States, and Bengali cuisine has been established as one of the most popular cuisines in the country with hundreds of Bengali restaurants in each major city {{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} and several similar eateries in smaller cities and towns. There are many Bangladeshi markets and stores in the United States.  Some of the largest are in New York City, [[Paterson, New Jersey]], [[Central New Jersey]], Washington, D.C., Atlantic City, and Los Angeles.\n\n===Languages===\nBangladeshi Americans often retain their native language [[Bengali language|Bengali]] and run many programs to nourish their mother tongue. However, many also speak Bengali dialects or other languages related to Bengali, the most common being [[Sylheti]] which is spoken by people from the [[Sylhet Division]] in Bangladesh, and [[Chatgaya]] which is spoken by Bangladeshis from [[Chittagong]].\n\n===Religion===\n\nBefore the [[colonization]] of India by [[Great Britain]], [[folk religion]] across the [[Bengal]] region incorporated elements of [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Islam]] to varying degrees. By the time of the [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|Partition of Bengal]], Bengalis began to classify themselves with one religion or another. Today, the vast majority of Bangladeshi American Muslims nominally subscribe to [[Sunni Islam]]. In smaller towns in America, Bangladeshi Americans will pray at home and make trips to attend their mosque or temple during major holidays. In major cities, Bangladeshi Americans who are Muslim hold religious services in their own mosques. There are also a number of major Hindu temples in the United States where Bangladeshi Americans play an important part in the leadership of their congregations. Due to the legacy of [[Buddhism]] as well as the [[Bengal Renaissance]], many Bangladeshi Americans continue traditions of [[humanism]] and identify as non-religious, secularist, [[atheist]], [[agnostic]] and [[gnostic]].\n\n<!-- PLEASE RESPECT ALPHABETICAL ORDER -->\n\n==Notable people==\n{{Main list|List of Bangladeshi Americans}}\n[[File:Dr. Omar Ishrak.jpg|right|upright|thumb|[[Omar Ishrak]] - Chairman of [[Intel]] and [[Medtronic]]]]\n[[File:Sears Tower ss.jpg|right|upright|thumb|[[Sears Tower]] (now Willis Tower), was designed by [[Fazlur Rahman Khan]].
