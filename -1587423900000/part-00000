[[Military]] slang is often used to reinforce or reflect (usually friendly and [[Military humor|humorous]]) [[interservice rivalries]].\n\n==Acronym slang in US Military==\n{{Main|List of military slang terms}}\nA number of military slang terms are [[Acronym and initialism|acronyms]]. [[Rick Atkinson]] ascribes the origin of SNAFU (Situation Normal, All Fucked Up), FUBAR (Fucked Up Beyond Any Repair or \"All Recognition\"), and a bevy of other terms to cynical [[GI (military)|GIs]] ridiculing the [[United States Army]]'s penchant for acronyms.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Day of Battle: The War in Sicily and Italy, 1943\u20131944 |series=The Liberation Trilogy |first=Rick |last=Atkinson |year=2007 |publisher=Henry Holt |page=[https://archive.org/details/dayofbattlewarin00atki/page/36 36] |isbn=978-0-8050-6289-2 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/dayofbattlewarin00atki/page/36 }}</ref>\n\nTerms then end up being used in other industries as these GIs complete their services. For example, FUBAR evolved into [[Foobar]] as GIs coming home from World War II matriculated into [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], with the first written use from a club at MIT called the [[Tech Model Railroad Club]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.computer-dictionary-online.org/definitions-f/foo.html|title=Computer Dictionary Online}}, computer-dictionary-online.org</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of government and military acronyms]]\n* [[List of U.S. government and military acronyms]]\n** [[List of U.S. Air Force acronyms and expressions]]\n** [[List of United States Marine Corps acronyms and expressions|List of U.S. Marine Corps acronyms and expressions]]\n** [[List of U.S. Navy acronyms and expressions]]\n* [[Army creole]]\n* [[Grande Arm\u00e9e slang]] (French Army slang during the [[Napoleonic Wars]])\n* [[Voice procedure]]\n* [[Junjiahua]], also known as \"military speech\", a collection of scattered modern day Chinese dialects derived from the lingua franca of the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368 - 1644) military\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|last=Hakim|first=Joy|title=A History of Us: War, Peace and all that Jazz|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1995| location=New York|isbn=0-19-509514-6}}\n* {{cite news|last=Jacobson|first=Gary|date=August 14, 1994|work=[[The Dallas Morning News]]|title=Humor best way to remove last of 'Bohicans' resistance|page=7H|accessdate=7 November 2008|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DM&p_theme=dm&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0ED3D4DDA7D891CC&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D}}\n* {{cite news|last=Stromberg|first=Rich|date=May 10, 2005|work=[[UWIRE]]|title=Grab your ankles and say BOHICA|accessdate=7 November 2008|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-108572048.html}}{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wiktionary|Appendix:Glossary of military slang|:Category:Military slang by language}}\n* [http://www2.iath.virginia.edu/sixties/HTML_docs/Resources/Glossary/Sixties_Term_Gloss_K_P.html Glossary of Military Terms & Slang from the Vietnam War]\n* [http://www.combat.ws/S4/MILTERMS/INDEX.HTM Military Terms of the Modern Era]\n* [http://www.allacronyms.com/military_slang/topic Military Slang Acronyms and Abbreviations]\n* {{Wiktionary-inline|Appendix:Australian English military slang}}\n* {{Wiktionary-inline|Appendix:Canadian military slang}}\n* {{Wiktionary-inline|Appendix:U.S. Navy slang}}\n\n[[Category:Military slang and jargon| ]]\n[[Category:Military humor]]\n", "name_user": "Bender235", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSee also", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_slang"}

Fox shows that were included in the Animation Station lineup are ''American Dad!'', ''Bob's Burgers'' and ''Family Guy''. Former Animation Domination shows have also been featured in this block, namely ''The Cleveland Show'' and ''King of the Hill'', as well as former Fox cartoon ''[[Futurama]]''. With the closure of FOUR in 2016, the block was quietly ended.\n\nIn Canada, the block aired on the [[Global Television Network]], which branded the lineup as \"Animation Rules\" with [[simultaneous substitution]]s for Canadian advertising. Throughout its run it was always followed by the drama ''[[Brothers and Sisters (2006 TV series)|Brothers and Sisters]]'', which was a simsub of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] broadcast, except that from 2005 to 2006, it was followed by ''[[Crossing Jordan]]'', which was a simsub of the [[NBC]] broadcast, because neither ''Brothers and Sisters'' was created, nor it was ready yet, and from 2011 to the original block's end in 2014, ''[[The Good Wife]]'' followed it, which was a simsub of the [[CBS]] broadcast, because ''Brothers and Sisters'' finished airing its run.
