Introduced in the late 1920s in [[Mechanical television|mechanical]] form, television sets became a popular consumer product after World War II in electronic form, using [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT) technology. The addition of color to broadcast television after 1953 further increased the popularity of television sets in the 1960s, and an outdoor antenna became a common feature of suburban homes. The ubiquitous television set became the display device for the first recorded media in the 1970s, such as [[Betamax]], [[VHS]] and later [[DVD]]. It has been used as a display device since the first generation of [[home computer]]s (e.g. [[Timex Sinclair 1000]]) and dedicated [[video game]] consoles (e.g. Atari) in the 1980s. By the early 2010s, [[Flat panel display|flat-panel]] television incorporating [[liquid-crystal display]] (LCD) technology, especially [[LED-backlit LCD]] technology, largely replaced CRT and other display technologies.<ref name=\"displaysearch.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.displaysearch.com/cps/rde/xchg/displaysearch/hs.xsl/140415_lcd_tv_growth_improving_as_plasma_and_crt_tv_disappear.asp|title=IHS Technology \u2013 The Source for Critical Information and Insight. - IHS Technology|website=www.displaysearch.com}}</ref><ref name=\"cnet.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/rip-rear-projection-tv/|title=RIP, rear-projection TV|publisher=}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"cepro.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cepro.com/article/mitsubishi_drops_dlp_displays_goodbye_rptvs_forever/|title=Mitsubishi Drops DLP Displays: Goodbye RPTVs Forever|first=Julie|last=Jacobson|website=www.cepro.com}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"tomsguide.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tomsguide.com/us/lg-end-plasma-tvs,news-19840.html|title=LG's Exit May Herald End of Plasma TVs - Tom's Guide|date=28 October 2014|publisher=}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"datadisplay-group.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.datadisplay-group.com/fileadmin/pdf/produkte/EOL_PCN/EOL_notice_customer_CCFL_reflector120711.pdf|title=Discontinue Notice of TFT-LCD (CCFL Products)|publisher=Mitsubishi Electric|date=July 11, 2012|format=pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130329170605/http://www.datadisplay-group.com/fileadmin/pdf/produkte/EOL_PCN/EOL_notice_customer_CCFL_reflector120711.pdf|archive-date=March 29, 2013}}</ref> Modern flat panel TVs are typically capable of high-definition display (720p, 1080i, 1080p) and can also play content from a [[USB]] device.\n\n==History==\n{{main article|History of television}}\n\n===Early television===\n[[File:RCA 630-TS Television.jpg|thumb|right|RCA 630-TS, the first mass-produced electronic television set, which sold in 1946\u20131947]]\n[[Mechanical television]]s were commercially sold from 1928 to 1934 in the United Kingdom,<ref>[http://www.tvhistory.tv/Baird%20TV-Early%20Years.htm Early British Television: Baird], Television History: The First 75 Years.</ref> United States, and Soviet Union.<ref>[http://www.tvhistory.tv/pre-1935.htm Pre-1935], Television History: The First 75 Years.

The images may represent electrical [[waveform]]s ([[oscilloscope]]), pictures ([[television]], [[computer monitor]]), [[radar]] targets or others. The CRT uses an evacuated glass envelope, which is large, deep (i.e., long from front screen face to rear end), fairly heavy, and relatively fragile. As a matter of safety, both the face (panel) and back (funnel) were typically made of thick [[lead glass]] so as to block most electron emissions from the electron gun in the very back of the tube. By the early 1970s, most color TVs replaced leaded glass in the face panel with vitrified barium glass, which also blocked electron gun emissions but allowed better color visibility. This also eliminated the need for cadmium phosphors in earlier color televisions. Leaded glass, which is less expensive, continued to be used in the funnel glass, which is not visible to the consumer.\n\nIn television sets and [[computer monitor]]s, the entire front area of the tube is scanned repetitively and systematically in a fixed pattern called a [[raster scan|raster]]. An image is produced by controlling the intensity of each of the three [[electron beams]], one for each additive primary color (red, green, and blue) with a [[video signal]] as a reference.<ref name='workings'>{{cite web|title='How Computer Monitors Work'|url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/monitor7.htm |accessdate=4 October 2009 }}</ref> In all modern CRT monitors and televisions, the beams are bent by ''magnetic deflection'', a varying magnetic field generated by coils and driven by electronic circuits around the neck of the tube, although [[electrostatic deflection]] is commonly used in [[oscilloscope]]s, a type of diagnostic instrument.<ref name='workings' />\n\n===DLP===\n{{main article|Digital Light Processing}}\n[[File:Christie Mirage 5000.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Christie Mirage 5000, a 2001 DLP projector.]]\nDigital Light Processing (DLP) is a type of projector technology that uses a [[digital micromirror device]]. Some DLPs have a TV tuner, which makes them a type of TV display. It was originally developed in 1987 by [[Larry Hornbeck]] of [[Texas Instruments]]. While the DLP imaging device was invented by Texas Instruments, the first DLP based projector was introduced by Digital Projection Ltd in 1997. Digital Projection and Texas Instruments were both awarded Emmy Awards in 1998 for the DLP projector technology. DLP is used in a variety of display applications from traditional static displays to interactive displays and also non-traditional embedded applications including medical, security, and industrial uses.\n\nDLP technology is used in DLP front projectors (standalone projection units for classrooms and business primarily), DLP rear projection television sets, and digital signs. It is also used in about 85% of digital cinema projection, and in [[additive manufacturing]] as a power source in some printers to cure resins into solid 3D objects.<ref>{{cite web|title=How Digital Light Processing Works|url=https://thre3d.com/how-it-works/light-photopolymerization/digital-light-processing-dlp|publisher=THRE3D.com|accessdate=3 February 2014|archive-url=http://archive.today/L3qfz|archive-date=3 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Plasma===\n{{main article|Plasma display}}\n\nA [[plasma TV|plasma]] display panel (PDP) is a type of [[flat panel display]] common to large TV displays {{convert|30|in|cm}} or larger.

LCD televisions are much thinner and lighter than [[cathode ray tube]] (CRTs) of similar display size and are available in much larger sizes (e.g., 90-inch diagonal). When manufacturing costs fell, this combination of features made LCDs practical for television receivers.\n\nIn 2007, LCD televisions surpassed sales of CRT-based televisions globally for the first time,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/02/22/displaysearch_crt_lcd_global_q4/|title=Global LCD TV sales overtake CRT|last=Sherwood|first=James|date=22 February 2008|work=[[The Register]]|access-date=3 July 2018|language=en}}</ref> and their sales figures relative to other technologies accelerated.

In the mid-2010s LCDs became, by far, the most widely produced and sold television display type.<ref name=\"displaysearch.com\"/><ref name=\"cnet.com\"/>\n\nLCDs also have disadvantages. Other technologies address these weaknesses, including [[organic light-emitting diode|OLED]]s, [[Field emission display|FED]] and [[Surface-conduction electron-emitter display|SED]].\n\n===OLED===\n{{main article|Organic light-emitting diode}}\n[[File:LG\uc804\uc790, \uae5c\ube61\uc784 \uc5c6\ub294 55\uc778\uce58 3D OLED TV \uacf5\uac1c(2).jpg|thumb|left|200px|An OLED TV.]]\n\nAn OLED (organic light-emitting diode) is a [[light-emitting diode]] (LED) in which the [[emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emissive]] [[electroluminescence|electroluminescent]] layer is a film of [[organic compound]] which emits light in response to an electric current. This layer of [[organic semiconductor]] is situated between two electrodes. Generally, at least one of these electrodes is transparent. OLEDs are used to create [[digital display]]s in devices such as television screens. It is also used for [[computer monitor]]s, portable systems such as [[mobile phones]], [[handheld game console]]s and [[personal digital assistant|PDA]]s.\n\nThere are two main families of OLED: those based on small molecules and those employing [[polymer]]s. Adding mobile [[ion]]s to an OLED creates a [[light-emitting electrochemical cell]] or LEC, which has a slightly different mode of operation. OLED displays can use either [[Passive matrix addressing|passive-matrix]] (PMOLED) or [[Active matrix addressing|active-matrix]] addressing schemes. Active-matrix OLEDs ([[Active-matrix OLED|AMOLED]]) require a [[thin-film transistor]] backplane to switch each individual pixel on or off, but allow for higher resolution and larger display sizes.\n\nAn OLED display works without a [[backlight]]. Thus, it can display deep [[black level]]s and can be thinner and lighter than a [[liquid crystal display]] (LCD). In low ambient light conditions such as a dark room, an OLED screen can achieve a higher [[contrast ratio]] than an LCD, whether the LCD uses [[cold cathode|cold cathode fluorescent lamps]] or [[LED-backlit LCD television|LED backlight]].\n\n==Outdoor television==\nAn ''outdoor television set '' designed for outdoor use is usually found in the outdoor sections of [[Bar (establishment)|bar]]s,[[sports field]], or other community facilities. Most outdoor televisions use [[high-definition television]] technology. Their body is more robust. The screens are designed to remain clearly visible even in sunny outdoor lighting. The screens also have anti-reflective coatings to prevent glare. They are weather-resistant and often also have anti-theft brackets. Outdoor TV models can also be connected with [[BD player]]s and [[personal video recorder|PVRs]] for greater functionality.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/baig/2014/08/19/sunbrite-outdoor-tv-review-an-expensive-luxury/14067719/|title=SunBrite outdoor TV: An expensive luxury|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Replacing==\nIn the United States, the average consumer replaces their television every 6.9 years, but research suggests that due to advanced software and apps, the replacement cycle may be shortening.<ref>{{cite news |last=Pierce |first=David |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/your-smart-tv-is-only-going-to-get-dumber-1543154401 |title=Your Smart TV Is Only Going to Get Dumber |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=2018-11-25 |accessdate=2018-11-27 }}</ref>\n\n==Recycling and disposal==\nDue to recent changes in [[electronic waste]] legislation, economical and environmentally friendly television disposal has been made increasingly more available in the form of television recycling.

Introduced in the late 1920s in [[Mechanical television|mechanical]] form, television sets became a popular consumer product after World War II in electronic form, using [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT) technology. The addition of color to broadcast television after 1953 further increased the popularity of television sets in the 1960s, and an outdoor antenna became a common feature of suburban homes. The ubiquitous television set became the display device for the first recorded media in the 1970s, such as [[Betamax]], [[VHS]] and later [[DVD]]. It has been used as a display device since the first generation of [[home computer]]s (e.g. [[Timex Sinclair 1000]]) and dedicated [[video game]] consoles (e.g. Atari) in the 1980s. By the early 2010s, [[Flat panel display|flat-panel]] television incorporating [[liquid-crystal display]] (LCD) technology, especially [[LED-backlit LCD]] technology, largely replaced CRT and other display technologies.<ref name=\"displaysearch.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.displaysearch.com/cps/rde/xchg/displaysearch/hs.xsl/140415_lcd_tv_growth_improving_as_plasma_and_crt_tv_disappear.asp|title=IHS Technology \u2013 The Source for Critical Information and Insight. - IHS Technology|website=www.displaysearch.com}}</ref><ref name=\"cnet.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/rip-rear-projection-tv/|title=RIP, rear-projection TV|publisher=}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"cepro.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cepro.com/article/mitsubishi_drops_dlp_displays_goodbye_rptvs_forever/|title=Mitsubishi Drops DLP Displays: Goodbye RPTVs Forever|first=Julie|last=Jacobson|website=www.cepro.com}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"tomsguide.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tomsguide.com/us/lg-end-plasma-tvs,news-19840.html|title=LG's Exit May Herald End of Plasma TVs - Tom's Guide|date=28 October 2014|publisher=}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"datadisplay-group.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.datadisplay-group.com/fileadmin/pdf/produkte/EOL_PCN/EOL_notice_customer_CCFL_reflector120711.pdf|title=Discontinue Notice of TFT-LCD (CCFL Products)|publisher=Mitsubishi Electric|date=July 11, 2012|format=pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130329170605/http://www.datadisplay-group.com/fileadmin/pdf/produkte/EOL_PCN/EOL_notice_customer_CCFL_reflector120711.pdf|archive-date=March 29, 2013}}</ref> Modern flat panel TVs are typically capable of high-definition display (720p, 1080i, 1080p) and can also play content from a [[USB]] device.\n\n==History==\n{{main article|History of television}}\n\n===Early television===\n[[File:RCA 630-TS Television.jpg|thumb|right|RCA 630-TS, the first mass-produced electronic television set, which sold in 1946\u20131947]]\n[[Mechanical television]]s were commercially sold from 1928 to 1934 in the United Kingdom,<ref>[http://www.tvhistory.tv/Baird%20TV-Early%20Years.htm Early British Television: Baird], Television History: The First 75 Years.</ref> United States, and Soviet Union.<ref>[http://www.tvhistory.tv/pre-1935.htm Pre-1935], Television History: The First 75 Years.

The images may represent electrical [[waveform]]s ([[oscilloscope]]), pictures ([[television]], [[computer monitor]]), [[radar]] targets or others. The CRT uses an evacuated glass envelope, which is large, deep (i.e., long from front screen face to rear end), fairly heavy, and relatively fragile. As a matter of safety, both the face (panel) and back (funnel) were typically made of thick [[lead glass]] so as to block most electron emissions from the electron gun in the very back of the tube. By the early 1970s, most color TVs replaced leaded glass in the face panel with vitrified barium glass, which also blocked electron gun emissions but allowed better color visibility. This also eliminated the need for cadmium phosphors in earlier color televisions. Leaded glass, which is less expensive, continued to be used in the funnel glass, which is not visible to the consumer.\n\nIn television sets and [[computer monitor]]s, the entire front area of the tube is scanned repetitively and systematically in a fixed pattern called a [[raster scan|raster]]. An image is produced by controlling the intensity of each of the three [[electron beams]], one for each additive primary color (red, green, and blue) with a [[video signal]] as a reference.<ref name='workings'>{{cite web|title='How Computer Monitors Work'|url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/monitor7.htm |accessdate=4 October 2009 }}</ref> In all modern CRT monitors and televisions, the beams are bent by ''magnetic deflection'', a varying magnetic field generated by coils and driven by electronic circuits around the neck of the tube, although [[electrostatic deflection]] is commonly used in [[oscilloscope]]s, a type of diagnostic instrument.<ref name='workings' />\n\n===DLP===\n{{main article|Digital Light Processing}}\n[[File:Christie Mirage 5000.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Christie Mirage 5000, a 2001 DLP projector.]]\nDigital Light Processing (DLP) is a type of projector technology that uses a [[digital micromirror device]]. Some DLPs have a TV tuner, which makes them a type of TV display. It was originally developed in 1987 by [[Larry Hornbeck]] of [[Texas Instruments]]. While the DLP imaging device was invented by Texas Instruments, the first DLP based projector was introduced by Digital Projection Ltd in 1997. Digital Projection and Texas Instruments were both awarded Emmy Awards in 1998 for the DLP projector technology. DLP is used in a variety of display applications from traditional static displays to interactive displays and also non-traditional embedded applications including medical, security, and industrial uses.\n\nDLP technology is used in DLP front projectors (standalone projection units for classrooms and business primarily), DLP rear projection television sets, and digital signs. It is also used in about 85% of digital cinema projection, and in [[additive manufacturing]] as a power source in some printers to cure resins into solid 3D objects.<ref>{{cite web|title=How Digital Light Processing Works|url=https://thre3d.com/how-it-works/light-photopolymerization/digital-light-processing-dlp|publisher=THRE3D.com|accessdate=3 February 2014|archive-url=http://archive.today/L3qfz|archive-date=3 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Plasma===\n{{main article|Plasma display}}\n\nA [[plasma TV|plasma]] display panel (PDP) is a type of [[flat panel display]] common to large TV displays {{convert|30|in|cm}} or larger. They are called \"[[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]\" displays because the technology utilizes small cells containing [[electrically]] [[electric charge|charged]] [[ionized]] [[gases]], or what are in essence chambers more commonly known as [[fluorescent lamp]]s.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===LCD===\n{{main article|Liquid crystal display}}\n[[File:LCD generic tv.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A generic LCD TV, with speakers on either side of the screen.]]Liquid-crystal-display televisions (LCD TV) are television sets that use [[Liquid-crystal display]]s to produce images. LCD televisions are much thinner and lighter than [[cathode ray tube]] (CRTs) of similar display size and are available in much larger sizes (e.g., 90-inch diagonal). When manufacturing costs fell, this combination of features made LCDs practical for television receivers.\n\nIn 2007, LCD televisions surpassed sales of CRT-based televisions globally for the first time,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/02/22/displaysearch_crt_lcd_global_q4/|title=Global LCD TV sales overtake CRT|last=Sherwood|first=James|date=22 February 2008|work=[[The Register]]|access-date=3 July 2018|language=en}}</ref> and their sales figures relative to other technologies accelerated. LCD TVs quickly displaced the only major competitors in the large-screen market, the [[Plasma display|plasma display panel]] and [[rear-projection television]]. In the mid-2010s LCDs became, by far, the most widely produced and sold television display type.<ref name=\"displaysearch.com\"/><ref name=\"cnet.com\"/>\n\nLCDs also have disadvantages. Other technologies address these weaknesses, including [[organic light-emitting diode|OLED]]s, [[Field emission display|FED]] and [[Surface-conduction electron-emitter display|SED]].\n\n===OLED===\n{{main article|Organic light-emitting diode}}\n[[File:LG\uc804\uc790, \uae5c\ube61\uc784 \uc5c6\ub294 55\uc778\uce58 3D OLED TV \uacf5\uac1c(2).jpg|thumb|left|200px|An OLED TV.]]\n\nAn OLED (organic light-emitting diode) is a [[light-emitting diode]] (LED) in which the [[emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emissive]] [[electroluminescence|electroluminescent]] layer is a film of [[organic compound]] which emits light in response to an electric current. This layer of [[organic semiconductor]] is situated between two electrodes. Generally, at least one of these electrodes is transparent. OLEDs are used to create [[digital display]]s in devices such as television screens. It is also used for [[computer monitor]]s, portable systems such as [[mobile phones]], [[handheld game console]]s and [[personal digital assistant|PDA]]s.\n\nThere are two main families of OLED: those based on small molecules and those employing [[polymer]]s. Adding mobile [[ion]]s to an OLED creates a [[light-emitting electrochemical cell]] or LEC, which has a slightly different mode of operation. OLED displays can use either [[Passive matrix addressing|passive-matrix]] (PMOLED) or [[Active matrix addressing|active-matrix]] addressing schemes. Active-matrix OLEDs ([[Active-matrix OLED|AMOLED]]) require a [[thin-film transistor]] backplane to switch each individual pixel on or off, but allow for higher resolution and larger display sizes.\n\nAn OLED display works without a [[backlight]]. Thus, it can display deep [[black level]]s and can be thinner and lighter than a [[liquid crystal display]] (LCD). In low ambient light conditions such as a dark room, an OLED screen can achieve a higher [[contrast ratio]] than an LCD, whether the LCD uses [[cold cathode|cold cathode fluorescent lamps]] or [[LED-backlit LCD television|LED backlight]].\n\n==Outdoor television==\nAn ''outdoor television set '' designed for outdoor use is usually found in the outdoor sections of [[Bar (establishment)|bar]]s,[[sports field]], or other community facilities. Most outdoor televisions use [[high-definition television]] technology. Their body is more robust. The screens are designed to remain clearly visible even in sunny outdoor lighting. The screens also have anti-reflective coatings to prevent glare. They are weather-resistant and often also have anti-theft brackets. Outdoor TV models can also be connected with [[BD player]]s and [[personal video recorder|PVRs]] for greater functionality.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/baig/2014/08/19/sunbrite-outdoor-tv-review-an-expensive-luxury/14067719/|title=SunBrite outdoor TV: An expensive luxury|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Replacing==\nIn the United States, the average consumer replaces their television every 6.9 years, but research suggests that due to advanced software and apps, the replacement cycle may be shortening.<ref>{{cite news |last=Pierce |first=David |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/your-smart-tv-is-only-going-to-get-dumber-1543154401 |title=Your Smart TV Is Only Going to Get Dumber |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=2018-11-25 |accessdate=2018-11-27 }}</ref>\n\n==Recycling and disposal==\nDue to recent changes in [[electronic waste]] legislation, economical and environmentally friendly television disposal has been made increasingly more available in the form of television recycling.

R. (2006). ''The Periodic Table: Its Story ad Its Significance''; New York City, New York; Oxford University Press.</ref> Around 330 BCE, the [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosopher]] [[Aristotle]] proposed that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more ''roots'', an idea that had originally been suggested by the [[Sicily|Sicilian]] philosopher [[Empedocles]]. The four roots, which were later renamed as ''elements'' by [[Plato]], were ''[[earth (classical element)|earth]]'', ''[[water (classical element)|water]]'', ''[[air (classical element)|air]]'' and ''[[fire (classical element)|fire]]''. Similar ideas about these four elements also existed in other ancient traditions, such as [[Indian philosophy]].\n\n== First categorizations ==\n\nThe history of the periodic table is also a history of the [[Timeline of chemical elements discoveries|discovery of the chemical elements]]. The first person in history to discover a new element was [[Hennig Brand]], a [[Bankruptcy|bankrupt]] [[Germans|German]] merchant. Brand tried to discover the [[Philosopher's Stone]]\u2014a mythical object that was supposed to turn inexpensive base [[metal]]s into gold. In 1669 (or later), his experiments with [[Distillation|distilled]] human [[urine]] resulted in the production of a glowing white substance, which he called \"cold fire\" (''kaltes Feuer'').<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/discoveryoftheel002045mbp#page/n135/mode/2up|title=Discovery of the Elements|last1=Weeks|first1=Mary|date=1956|publisher=Journal of Chemical Education|edition=6th|location=Easton, Pennsylvania, USA|page=122}}</ref> He kept his discovery secret until 1680, when Irish chemist [[Robert Boyle]] rediscovered phosphorus and published his findings.

Lavoisier defined an element as a substance that cannot be broken down into a simpler substance by a chemical reaction.<ref>Lavoisier with Robert Kerr, trans. (1790) ''Elements of Chemistry''. Edinburgh, Scotland: William Creech. [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=gri.ark:/13960/t5v735k9h;view=1up;seq=30 From p. xxiv:] \"I shall therefore only add upon this subject, that if, by the term ''elements'', we mean to express those simple and indivisible atoms of which matter is composed, it is extremely probable we know nothing at all about them; but, if we apply the term ''elements'', or ''principles of bodies'', to express our idea of the last point which analysis is capable of reaching, we must admit, as elements, all substances into which we are capable, by any means, to reduce bodies by decomposition. Not that we are entitled to affirm, that these substances we consider as simple may not be compounded of two, or even of a greater number of principles; but, since these principles cannot be separated, or rather since we have not hitherto discovered means of separating them, they act with regard to us as simple substances, and we ought never to suppose them compounded until experiment and observation has proved them to be so.\"</ref> This simple definition served for a century and lasted until the discovery of [[subatomic particle]]s. Lavoisier's book contained a list of \"simple substances\" that Lavoisier believed could not be broken down further, which included [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], [[hydrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[zinc]] and [[sulfur]], which formed the basis for the modern list of elements.

Works on organizing the elements by atomic weight had until then been stymied by inaccurate measurements of the atomic weights.<ref name=\"Meyer table\" /> In 1868, he revised his table, but this revision was published as a draft only after his death.

The paper also included a line chart of relative atomic volumes, which illustrated periodic relationships of physical characteristics of the elements, and which assisted Meyer in deciding where elements should appear in his periodic table.

In total, he predicted eighteen elements, though only half corresponded to elements that were later discovered.<ref name=\"pastfuture\" />\n\nEven as Mendeleev corrected positions of some elements, he thought that some relationships that he could find in his grand scheme of periodicity could not be found because some elements were still undiscovered, and thus he believed these elements that were still undiscovered would have properties that could be deduced from the expected relationships with other elements. In 1870, he first tried to characterize the yet undiscovered elements, and he gave detailed [[Mendeleev's predicted elements|predictions]] for three elements, which he termed eka-boron, eka-aluminium, and eka-silicium. In 1871, he expanded his predictions further as well as named a few more elements, although he noted that the principles described for those three elements can be used to describe other missing elements, noting that he wouldn't for that reason describe the elements himself.{{Efn|1=Those elements Mendeleev explicitly mentioned, saying he would be most interested to see them discovered were: eka-caesium, dvi-caesium, eka-niobium, eka-tantalum, eka-manganese, tri-manganese, as well as a \"the entire ninth row and even almost a whole big period (starting with Ce = 140)\".}}\n\nCompared to the rest of the work, Mendeleev's 1869 list misplaces seven then-known elements: [[indium]], [[thorium]], and the five rare earths\u2014[[yttrium]], [[cerium]], [[lanthanum]], erbium, and [[didymium]] (the latter two were later found to be mixtures of different elements); ignoring those would allow him to restore the logic of increasing atomic weight. These elements (all thought to be divalent at the time) puzzled Mendeleev in that they did not show gradual increase in valency despite their seemingly consequential atomic weights.{{sfn|Thyssen|Binnemans|2015|p=159}} Mendeleev grouped them together, thinking of them as of a particular kind of series.{{Efn|He noted similarity despite sequential atomic weights; he termed such sequences as primary groups (as opposed to regular secondary groups, those in the likes of the halogens or the alkali metals). Other examples of primary groups included set of rhodium, ruthenium, and\npalladium, and the set of iridium, osmium, and platinum.}} In early 1870, he decided the weights for these elements must be wrong and that the rare earth metals should be trivalent (which accordingly increases their weights by half). He measured heat capacity of indium, uranium and cerium to demonstrate their increase of accounted valency (which was soon confirmed by Prussian chemist [[Robert Bunsen]]).{{sfn|Thyssen|Binnemans|2015|pp=174\u2013175}} Mendeleev considered the change by assessing each element an individual place in his system of the elements. \n\nMendeleev noticed that there was a significant difference in atomic mass between [[cerium]] and [[tantalum]] with no element between them; his consideration was that between them, there was a row of yet undiscovered elements, which would display similar properties to those elements which were to be found above and below them: for instance, an eka-molybdenum would behave as a heavier homolog of molybdenum and a lighter homolog of wolfram (the name under which Mendeleev knew [[tungsten]]).<ref name=\"scimag19\">{{cite journal|last=Cheisson|first=T.|last2=Schelter|first2=E.

He correctly determined the atomic number of all elements up to atomic number 50 ([[tin]]), though he made several errors with heavier elements. However, Broek did not have any method to experimentally verify the atomic numbers of elements; thus, they were still believed to be a consequence of atomic weight, which remained in use in ordering elements.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nMoseley was determined to test Broek's hypothesis.<ref name=moseley2010/> After a year of investigation of the [[Fraunhofer lines]] of various elements, he found a relationship between the X-ray [[wavelength]] of an element and its atomic number.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Moseley|first1=H.G.J.|title=The high-frequency spectra of the elements|journal=Philosophical Magazine|date=1914|volume=27|pages=703\u2013713|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x002266051;view=1up;seq=731|series=6th series|doi=10.1080/14786440408635141}}</ref> With this, Moseley obtained the first accurate measurements of atomic numbers and determined an absolute sequence to the elements, allowing him to restructure the periodic table. Moseley's research immediately resolved discrepancies between atomic weight and chemical properties, where sequencing strictly by atomic weight would result in groups with inconsistent chemical properties. For example, his measurements of X-ray wavelengths enabled him to correctly place [[argon]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;18) before [[potassium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;19), [[cobalt]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;27) before [[nickel]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;28), as well as [[tellurium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;52) before [[iodine]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;53), in line with [[periodic trends]]. The determination of atomic numbers also clarified the order of chemically similar rare earth elements; it was also used to confirm that [[Georges Urbain]]'s claimed discovery of a new rare earth element ([[celtium]]) was invalid, earning Moseley acclamation for this technique.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nSwedish physicist [[Karl Siegbahn]] continued Moseley's work for elements heavier than gold (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;79), and found that the heaviest known element at the time, [[uranium]], had atomic number 92. In determining the largest identified atomic number, gaps in the atomic number sequence were conclusively determined where an atomic number had no known corresponding element; the gaps occurred at atomic numbers 43, 61, 72, 75, 85, and 87.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\n=== Electron shell and quantum mechanics ===\n<!-- Janet and his table should definitely be mentioned here.

The paper also included a line chart of relative atomic volumes, which illustrated periodic relationships of physical characteristics of the elements, and which assisted Meyer in deciding where elements should appear in his periodic table.

In total, he predicted eighteen elements, though only half corresponded to elements that were later discovered.<ref name=\"pastfuture\" />\n\nEven as Mendeleev corrected positions of some elements, he thought that some relationships that he could find in his grand scheme of periodicity could not be found because some elements were still undiscovered, and thus he believed these elements that were still undiscovered would have properties that could be deduced from the expected relationships with other elements. In 1870, he first tried to characterize the yet undiscovered elements, and he gave detailed [[Mendeleev's predicted elements|predictions]] for three elements, which he termed eka-boron, eka-aluminium, and eka-silicium. In 1871, he expanded his predictions further as well as named a few more elements, although he noted that the principles described for those three elements can be used to describe other missing elements, noting that he wouldn't for that reason describe the elements himself.{{Efn|1=Those elements Mendeleev explicitly mentioned, saying he would be most interested to see them discovered were: eka-caesium, dvi-caesium, eka-niobium, eka-tantalum, eka-manganese, tri-manganese, as well as a \"the entire ninth row and even almost a whole big period (starting with Ce = 140)\".}}\n\nCompared to the rest of the work, Mendeleev's 1869 list misplaces seven then-known elements: [[indium]], [[thorium]], and the five rare earths\u2014[[yttrium]], [[cerium]], [[lanthanum]], erbium, and [[didymium]] (the latter two were later found to be mixtures of different elements); ignoring those would allow him to restore the logic of increasing atomic weight. These elements (all thought to be divalent at the time) puzzled Mendeleev in that they did not show gradual increase in valency despite their seemingly consequential atomic weights.{{sfn|Thyssen|Binnemans|2015|p=159}} Mendeleev grouped them together, thinking of them as of a particular kind of series.{{Efn|He noted similarity despite sequential atomic weights; he termed such sequences as primary groups (as opposed to regular secondary groups, those in the likes of the halogens or the alkali metals). Other examples of primary groups included set of rhodium, ruthenium, and\npalladium, and the set of iridium, osmium, and platinum.}} In early 1870, he decided the weights for these elements must be wrong and that the rare earth metals should be trivalent (which accordingly increases their weights by half). He measured heat capacity of indium, uranium and cerium to demonstrate their increase of accounted valency (which was soon confirmed by Prussian chemist [[Robert Bunsen]]).{{sfn|Thyssen|Binnemans|2015|pp=174\u2013175}} Mendeleev considered the change by assessing each element an individual place in his system of the elements. \n\nMendeleev noticed that there was a significant difference in atomic mass between [[cerium]] and [[tantalum]] with no element between them; his consideration was that between them, there was a row of yet undiscovered elements, which would display similar properties to those elements which were to be found above and below them: for instance, an eka-molybdenum would behave as a heavier homolog of molybdenum and a lighter homolog of wolfram (the name under which Mendeleev knew [[tungsten]]).<ref name=\"scimag19\">{{cite journal|last=Cheisson|first=T.|last2=Schelter|first2=E.

He correctly determined the atomic number of all elements up to atomic number 50 ([[tin]]), though he made several errors with heavier elements. However, Broek did not have any method to experimentally verify the atomic numbers of elements; thus, they were still believed to be a consequence of atomic weight, which remained in use in ordering elements.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nMoseley was determined to test Broek's hypothesis.<ref name=moseley2010/> After a year of investigation of the [[Fraunhofer lines]] of various elements, he found a relationship between the X-ray [[wavelength]] of an element and its atomic number.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Moseley|first1=H.G.J.|title=The high-frequency spectra of the elements|journal=Philosophical Magazine|date=1914|volume=27|pages=703\u2013713|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x002266051;view=1up;seq=731|series=6th series|doi=10.1080/14786440408635141}}</ref> With this, Moseley obtained the first accurate measurements of atomic numbers and determined an absolute sequence to the elements, allowing him to restructure the periodic table. Moseley's research immediately resolved discrepancies between atomic weight and chemical properties, where sequencing strictly by atomic weight would result in groups with inconsistent chemical properties. For example, his measurements of X-ray wavelengths enabled him to correctly place [[argon]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;18) before [[potassium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;19), [[cobalt]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;27) before [[nickel]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;28), as well as [[tellurium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;52) before [[iodine]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;53), in line with [[periodic trends]]. The determination of atomic numbers also clarified the order of chemically similar rare earth elements; it was also used to confirm that [[Georges Urbain]]'s claimed discovery of a new rare earth element ([[celtium]]) was invalid, earning Moseley acclamation for this technique.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nSwedish physicist [[Karl Siegbahn]] continued Moseley's work for elements heavier than gold (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;79), and found that the heaviest known element at the time, [[uranium]], had atomic number 92. In determining the largest identified atomic number, gaps in the atomic number sequence were conclusively determined where an atomic number had no known corresponding element; the gaps occurred at atomic numbers 43, 61, 72, 75, 85, and 87.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\n=== Electron shell and quantum mechanics ===\n<!-- Janet and his table should definitely be mentioned here. Another thing to be mentioned (probably) here is the emergence of the 18=column table -->In 1914, Swedish physicist [[Johannes Rydberg]] noticed that the atomic numbers of the noble gases was equal to doubled sums of squares of simple numbers: 2 = 2\u00b71<sup>2</sup>, 10 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup>), 18 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup>), 36 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup>), 54 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup>), 86 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 4<sup>2</sup>).

Although it was thought that these transition series would include a series analogous to the rare earth elements, characterized by filling of the 5f shell, it was unknown where this series began. Predictions ranged from atomic number 90 (thorium) to 99, many of which proposed a beginning beyond the known elements (at or beyond atomic number 93).

It is now thought that because of relativistic effects, such an extension will feature elements that break the periodicity in known elements, thus posing another hurdle to future periodic table constructs.<ref name=PT172/>\n\nThe discovery of [[tennessine]] in 2010 filled the last remaining gap in the seventh period. Any newly discovered elements will thus be placed in an eighth period.\n\nDespite the completion of the seventh period, experimental chemistry of some transactinides has been shown to be inconsistent with the periodic law. In the 1990s, Ken Czerwinski at [[University of California, Berkeley]] observed similarities between rutherfordium and plutonium and dubnium and protactinium, rather than a clear continuation of periodicity in groups&nbsp;4 and&nbsp;5. More recent experiments on [[copernicium]] and [[flerovium]] have yielded inconsistent results, some of which suggest that these elements behave more like the noble gas [[radon]] rather than mercury and lead, their respective [[congener (chemistry)|congener]]s. As such, the chemistry of many superheavy elements has yet to be well-characterized, and it remains unclear whether the periodic law can still be used to extrapolate the properties of undiscovered elements.<ref name=\"NYT-20190827\">{{cite news |last=Roberts |first=Siobhan |title=Is It Time to Upend the Periodic Table? - The iconic chart of elements has served chemistry well for 150 years.
