The -''m''-/-''v''- alternation is a common enough phenomenon in Dravidian phonology\".{{sfnp|Zvelebil|1990|p=xxi}}\n\nFurthermore, another Dravidianist and linguist, [[Bhadriraju Krishnamurti]], in his book ''Dravidian Languages'' states:{{sfnp|Krishnamurti|2003|loc=p. 2, footnote 2}} {{quote|Joseph (1989: IJDL 18.2:134-42) gives extensive references to the use of the term ''{{IAST|dravi\u1e0da}}'', ''dramila'' first as the name of a people, then of a country. Sinhala BCE inscriptions cite ''{{IAST|dame\u1e0da}}''-, ''damela''- denoting Tamil merchants. Early Buddhist and Jaina sources used ''{{IAST|dami\u1e37a}}''- to refer to a people of south India (presumably Tamil); ''{{IAST|damilara\u1e6d\u1e6dha}}''- was a southern non-Aryan country; ''{{IAST|drami\u1e37a}}''-, ''{{IAST|drami\u1e0da}}'', and ''{{IAST|dravi\u1e0da}}''- were used as variants to designate a country in the south (''{{IAST|B\u1e5bhatsamhita-}}'', ''K\u0101dambar\u012b'', ''Da\u015bakum\u0101racarita-'', fourth to seventh centuries CE) (1989: 134\u2013138). It appears that ''{{IAST|dami\u1e37a}}''- was older than ''{{IAST|dravi\u1e0da}}''- which could be its Sanskritization.}}\n\nBased on what Krishnamurti states (referring to a scholarly paper published in the ''International Journal of Dravidian Linguistics''), the Sanskrit word ''{{IAST|dravi\u1e0da}}'' itself is later than ''{{IAST|dami\u1e37a}}'' since the dates for the forms with -r- are centuries later than the dates for the forms without -r- (''{{IAST|dami\u1e37a}}'', ''{{IAST|dame\u1e0da}}''-, ''damela''- etc.).\n\n== Discovery ==\nThe 14th century Sanskrit text ''[[Lilatilakam]]'', which is a grammar of [[Manipravalam]], states that the spoken languages of present-day Kerala and Tamil Nadu were similar, terming them as \"Drami\u1e0da\". The author doesn't consider the \"Kar\u1e47\u1e47\u0101\u1e6da\" (Kannada) and the \"Andhra\" (Telugu) languages as \"Drami\u1e0da\", because they were very different from the language of the \"Tamil Veda\" (''[[Tiruvaymoli]]''), but states that some people would include them in the \"Drami\u1e0da\" category.{{sfn|Shulman|2016|p=6}}\n\nIn 1816, [[Alexander D. Campbell]] suggested the existence of a Dravidian language family in his ''Grammar of the Teloogoo Language'',<ref>Alexander Duncan Campbell (1816) [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_PubopwMmteIC ''A Grammar of the Teloogoo Language''], ''commonly termed the Gentoo, peculiar to the Hindoos inhabiting the north eastern provinces of the Indian peninsula'', College of Fort St. George Press, Madras {{oclc|416559272}}</ref> in which he and [[Francis Whyte Ellis|Francis W. Ellis]] argued that [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Telugu language|Telugu]] descended from a common, non-[[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] ancestor.{{sfnp|Sreekumar|2009}} In 1856 [[Robert Caldwell]] published his ''Comparative Grammar of the Dravidian or South-Indian Family of Languages'',<ref>Robert Caldwell (1856) [https://archive.org/details/cu31924023009966 ''A Comparative Grammar of the Dravidian or South-Indian Family of Languages''], Williams and Norgate, London {{oclc|20216805}}</ref> which considerably expanded the Dravidian umbrella and established Dravidian as one of the major language groups of the world. Caldwell coined the term \"Dravidian\" for this family of languages, based on the usage of the [[Sanskrit]] word \u0926\u094d\u0930\u0935\u093f\u0926\u093e (Dravid\u0101) in the work ''Tantrav\u0101rttika'' by {{IAST|[[Kum\u0101rila Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da]]}}.{{sfnp|Zvelebil|1990|p=xx}} In his own words, Caldwell says,\n\n{{quote|The word I have chosen is 'Dravidian', from {{IAST|Dr\u0101vi\u1e0da}}, the adjectival form of {{IAST|Dravi\u1e0da}}. This term, it is true, has sometimes been used, and is still sometimes used, in almost as restricted a sense as that of Tamil itself, so that though on the whole it is the best term I can find, I admit it is not perfectly free from ambiguity. It is a term which has already been used more or less distinctively by Sanskrit philologists, as a generic appellation for the South Indian people and their languages, and it is the only single term they ever seem to have used in this manner. I have, therefore, no doubt of the propriety of adopting it.{{sfnp|Caldwell|1856|p=4}}}} The 1961 publication of the ''Dravidian Etymological Dictionary'' by [[T. Burrow]] and [[M. B. Emeneau]] proved a notable event in the study of Dravidian linguistics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dsal.uchicago.edu/dictionaries/burrow/|title=A Dravidian etymological dictionary.|first1=T.

Most scholars agree on four groups: South (or South Dravidian{{nbsp}}I), South-Central (or South Dravidian{{nbsp}}II), Central, and North Dravidian, but there are different proposals regarding the relationship between these groups. Earlier classifications grouped Central and South-Central Dravidian in a single branch.

Hence, the roots of words always occurred at the beginning. Nouns, verbs, and indeclinable words constituted the original word classes.\n* There are two numbers and four different gender systems, the ancestral system probably having \"male:non-male\" in the singular and \"person:non-person\" in the plural.\n* In a sentence, however complex, only one finite verb occurs, normally at the end, preceded if necessary by a number of gerunds.\n* Word order follows certain basic rules but is relatively free.\n* The main (and probably original) dichotomy in tense is past:non-past. Present tense developed later and independently in each language or subgroup.\n* Verbs are intransitive, transitive, and causative; there are also active and passive forms.\n* All of the positive verb forms have their corresponding negative counterparts, [[negative verbs]].\n\n==Phonology==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}\nDravidian languages are noted for the lack of distinction between aspirated and unaspirated stops. While some Dravidian languages have accepted large numbers of loan words from [[Sanskrit]] and other [[Indo-Iranian languages]] in addition to their already vast vocabulary, in which the [[orthography]] shows distinctions in voice and [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]], the words are pronounced in Dravidian according to different rules of [[phonology]] and [[phonotactics]]: aspiration of [[plosives]] is generally absent, regardless of the spelling of the word. This is not a universal phenomenon and is generally avoided in formal or careful speech, especially when reciting. For instance, [[Tamil language|Tamil]] does not distinguish between voiced and voiceless stops. In fact, the [[Tamil alphabet]] lacks symbols for voiced and aspirated stops. Dravidian languages are also characterized by a three-way distinction between [[Dental consonant|dental]], [[Alveolar consonant|alveolar]], and [[retroflex]] places of articulation as well as large numbers of [[Liquid consonant|liquids]].\n\n===Proto-Dravidian===\n{{main|Proto-Dravidian}}\nProto-Dravidian had five short and long vowels: ''*a'', ''*\u0101'', ''*i'', ''*\u012b'', ''*u'', ''*\u016b'', ''*e'', ''*\u0113'', ''*o'', ''*\u014d''. There were no diphthongs; ''ai'' and ''au'' are treated as *''ay'' and *''av'' (or *''aw'').{{sfnp|Subrahmanyam|1983}}{{sfnp|Zvelebil|1990}}{{sfnp|Krishnamurti|2003|p=90}}\nThe five-vowel system is largely preserved in the descendent subgroups.{{sfnp|Krishnamurti|2003|p=48}}\n\nThe following consonantal phonemes are reconstructed:{{sfnp|Subrahmanyam|1983|p=40}}{{sfnp|Zvelebil|1990}}{{sfnp|Krishnamurti|2003|p=91}}\n{| class=\"wikitable Unicode\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n! !!

The -''m''-/-''v''- alternation is a common enough phenomenon in Dravidian phonology\".{{sfnp|Zvelebil|1990|p=xxi}}\n\nFurthermore, another Dravidianist and linguist, [[Bhadriraju Krishnamurti]], in his book ''Dravidian Languages'' states:{{sfnp|Krishnamurti|2003|loc=p. 2, footnote 2}} {{quote|Joseph (1989: IJDL 18.2:134-42) gives extensive references to the use of the term ''{{IAST|dravi\u1e0da}}'', ''dramila'' first as the name of a people, then of a country. Sinhala BCE inscriptions cite ''{{IAST|dame\u1e0da}}''-, ''damela''- denoting Tamil merchants. Early Buddhist and Jaina sources used ''{{IAST|dami\u1e37a}}''- to refer to a people of south India (presumably Tamil); ''{{IAST|damilara\u1e6d\u1e6dha}}''- was a southern non-Aryan country; ''{{IAST|drami\u1e37a}}''-, ''{{IAST|drami\u1e0da}}'', and ''{{IAST|dravi\u1e0da}}''- were used as variants to designate a country in the south (''{{IAST|B\u1e5bhatsamhita-}}'', ''K\u0101dambar\u012b'', ''Da\u015bakum\u0101racarita-'', fourth to seventh centuries CE) (1989: 134\u2013138). It appears that ''{{IAST|dami\u1e37a}}''- was older than ''{{IAST|dravi\u1e0da}}''- which could be its Sanskritization.}}\n\nBased on what Krishnamurti states (referring to a scholarly paper published in the ''International Journal of Dravidian Linguistics''), the Sanskrit word ''{{IAST|dravi\u1e0da}}'' itself is later than ''{{IAST|dami\u1e37a}}'' since the dates for the forms with -r- are centuries later than the dates for the forms without -r- (''{{IAST|dami\u1e37a}}'', ''{{IAST|dame\u1e0da}}''-, ''damela''- etc.).\n\n== Discovery ==\nThe 14th century Sanskrit text ''[[Lilatilakam]]'', which is a grammar of [[Manipravalam]], states that the spoken languages of present-day Kerala and Tamil Nadu were similar, terming them as \"Drami\u1e0da\". The author doesn't consider the \"Kar\u1e47\u1e47\u0101\u1e6da\" (Kannada) and the \"Andhra\" (Telugu) languages as \"Drami\u1e0da\", because they were very different from the language of the \"Tamil Veda\" (''[[Tiruvaymoli]]''), but states that some people would include them in the \"Drami\u1e0da\" category.{{sfn|Shulman|2016|p=6}}\n\nIn 1816, [[Alexander D. Campbell]] suggested the existence of a Dravidian language family in his ''Grammar of the Teloogoo Language'',<ref>Alexander Duncan Campbell (1816) [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_PubopwMmteIC ''A Grammar of the Teloogoo Language''], ''commonly termed the Gentoo, peculiar to the Hindoos inhabiting the north eastern provinces of the Indian peninsula'', College of Fort St. George Press, Madras {{oclc|416559272}}</ref> in which he and [[Francis Whyte Ellis|Francis W. Ellis]] argued that [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Telugu language|Telugu]] descended from a common, non-[[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] ancestor.{{sfnp|Sreekumar|2009}} In 1856 [[Robert Caldwell]] published his ''Comparative Grammar of the Dravidian or South-Indian Family of Languages'',<ref>Robert Caldwell (1856) [https://archive.org/details/cu31924023009966 ''A Comparative Grammar of the Dravidian or South-Indian Family of Languages''], Williams and Norgate, London {{oclc|20216805}}</ref> which considerably expanded the Dravidian umbrella and established Dravidian as one of the major language groups of the world. Caldwell coined the term \"Dravidian\" for this family of languages, based on the usage of the [[Sanskrit]] word \u0926\u094d\u0930\u0935\u093f\u0926\u093e (Dravid\u0101) in the work ''Tantrav\u0101rttika'' by {{IAST|[[Kum\u0101rila Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da]]}}.{{sfnp|Zvelebil|1990|p=xx}} In his own words, Caldwell says,\n\n{{quote|The word I have chosen is 'Dravidian', from {{IAST|Dr\u0101vi\u1e0da}}, the adjectival form of {{IAST|Dravi\u1e0da}}. This term, it is true, has sometimes been used, and is still sometimes used, in almost as restricted a sense as that of Tamil itself, so that though on the whole it is the best term I can find, I admit it is not perfectly free from ambiguity. It is a term which has already been used more or less distinctively by Sanskrit philologists, as a generic appellation for the South Indian people and their languages, and it is the only single term they ever seem to have used in this manner. I have, therefore, no doubt of the propriety of adopting it.{{sfnp|Caldwell|1856|p=4}}}} The 1961 publication of the ''Dravidian Etymological Dictionary'' by [[T. Burrow]] and [[M. B.

After the [[Indo-Aryan migrations]] into north-western India, starting ca. 1500 BCE, and the establishment of the [[Kuru Kingdom|Kuru kingdom]] ca. 1100 BCE, a process of [[Sanskritisation]] started, which resulted in a [[language shift]] in northern India. Southern India has remained majority Dravidian, but pockets of Dravidian can be found in central India, Pakistan and Nepal.\n\nThe [[Kurukh people|Kurukh]] and [[Malto people|Malto]] are pockets of Dravidian languages in central India, spoken by people who may have migrated from south India. They do have myths about external origins.<ref>P. 83 ''The Quest for the Origins of Vedic Culture: The Indo-Aryan Migration'' Debate by Edwin Bryant</ref> The Kurukh have traditionally claimed to be from the [[Deccan Peninsula]],<ref>P. 18 ''The Or\u0101ons of Ch\u014dt\u0101 N\u0101gpur: their history, economic life, and social organization.'' by Sarat Chandra Roy, Rai Bahadur;  Alfred C Haddon</ref> more specifically [[Karnataka]].

The existence of the isolated northern outlier ''Brahui'' is consistent with the hypothesis that Dravidian formerly occupied much of North India but was displaced by the invading Indo-Aryan languages, and the presence in the Indo-Aryan languages of certain linguistic features, such as retroflex consonants, is often attributed to Dravidian substrate influence.\"}} However, it has been argued that the absence of any Old Iranian (Avestan) loanwords in Brahui suggests that the Brahui migrated to Balochistan from central India less than 1,000 years ago.

Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online. 30 Jun. 2008</ref> Many of these features are already present in the oldest known [[Indo-Aryan language]], the language of the ''[[Rigveda]]'' (c.{{nbsp}}1500 BCE), which also includes over a dozen words borrowed from Dravidian.{{sfnp|Krishnamurti|2003|p=6}}\n\n[[Vedic Sanskrit]] has [[retroflex consonant]]s ({{IAST|\u1e6d}}/{{IAST|\u1e0d}}, {{IAST|\u1e47}}) with about 88 words in the ''Rigveda'' having unconditioned retroflexes.{{sfnp|Kuiper|1991}}{{sfnp|Witzel|1999}} Some sample words are ''{{IAST|I\u1e6danta}}'', ''{{IAST|Ka\u1e47va}}'', ''{{IAST|\u015baka\u1e6d\u012b}}'', ''{{IAST|keva\u1e6da}}'', ''{{IAST|pu\u1e47ya}}'' and ''{{IAST|ma\u1e47\u1e0d\u016bka}}''.\nSince other [[Indo-European languages]], including other [[Indo-Iranian languages]], lack retroflex consonants, their presence in Indo-Aryan is often cited as evidence of substrate influence from close contact of the Vedic speakers with speakers of a foreign language family rich in retroflex consonants.{{sfnp|Kuiper|1991}}{{sfnp|Witzel|1999}} The Dravidian family is a serious candidate since it is rich in retroflex phonemes reconstructible back to the [[Proto-Dravidian language|Proto-Dravidian stage]].{{sfnp|Subrahmanyam|1983|p=40}}{{sfnp|Zvelebil|1990}}{{sfnp|Krishnamurti|2003|p=36}}\n\nIn addition, a number of grammatical features of Vedic Sanskrit not found in its sister [[Avestan language]] appear to have been borrowed from Dravidian languages.  These include the [[gerund]], which has the same function as in Dravidian.{{sfnp|Krishnamurti|2003|pp=36\u201337}} Some linguists explain this asymmetrical borrowing by arguing that Middle Indo-Aryan languages were built on a Dravidian [[substratum]].{{sfnp|Krishnamurti|2003|pp=40\u201341}} These scholars argue that the most plausible explanation for the presence of Dravidian structural features in Indic is [[language shift]], that is, native Dravidian speakers learning and adopting Indic languages.{{sfnp|Erdosy|1995|p=18}} Although each of the innovative traits in Indic could be accounted for by internal explanations, early Dravidian influence is the only explanation that can account for all of the innovations at once; moreover, it accounts for several of the innovative traits in Indic better than any internal explanation that has been proposed.{{sfnp|Thomason|Kaufman|1988|pp=141\u2013144}}\n\n==Grammar==\nThe most characteristic grammatical features of Dravidian languages are:<ref name=\"britannicaDVD\"/>\n* Dravidian languages are [[Agglutination|agglutinative]].\n* Word order is [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]] (SOV).\n* Most Dravidian languages have a [[clusivity]] distinction (notably, [[Kannada]] does not).\n* The major word classes are nouns (substantives, numerals, pronouns), adjectives, verbs, and indeclinables (particles, enclitics, adverbs, interjections, onomatopoetic words, echo words).\n* Proto-Dravidian used only suffixes, never prefixes or infixes, in the construction of inflected forms. Hence, the roots of words always occurred at the beginning. Nouns, verbs, and indeclinable words constituted the original word classes.\n* There are two numbers and four different gender systems, the ancestral system probably having \"male:non-male\" in the singular and \"person:non-person\" in the plural.\n* In a sentence, however complex, only one finite verb occurs, normally at the end, preceded if necessary by a number of gerunds.\n* Word order follows certain basic rules but is relatively free.\n* The main (and probably original) dichotomy in tense is past:non-past. Present tense developed later and independently in each language or subgroup.\n* Verbs are intransitive, transitive, and causative; there are also active and passive forms.\n* All of the positive verb forms have their corresponding negative counterparts, [[negative verbs]].\n\n==Phonology==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}\nDravidian languages are noted for the lack of distinction between aspirated and unaspirated stops. While some Dravidian languages have accepted large numbers of loan words from [[Sanskrit]] and other [[Indo-Iranian languages]] in addition to their already vast vocabulary, in which the [[orthography]] shows distinctions in voice and [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]], the words are pronounced in Dravidian according to different rules of [[phonology]] and [[phonotactics]]: aspiration of [[plosives]] is generally absent, regardless of the spelling of the word. This is not a universal phenomenon and is generally avoided in formal or careful speech, especially when reciting. For instance, [[Tamil language|Tamil]] does not distinguish between voiced and voiceless stops. In fact, the [[Tamil alphabet]] lacks symbols for voiced and aspirated stops. Dravidian languages are also characterized by a three-way distinction between [[Dental consonant|dental]], [[Alveolar consonant|alveolar]], and [[retroflex]] places of articulation as well as large numbers of [[Liquid consonant|liquids]].\n\n===Proto-Dravidian===\n{{main|Proto-Dravidian}}\nProto-Dravidian had five short and long vowels: ''*a'', ''*\u0101'', ''*i'', ''*\u012b'', ''*u'', ''*\u016b'', ''*e'', ''*\u0113'', ''*o'', ''*\u014d''. There were no diphthongs; ''ai'' and ''au'' are treated as *''ay'' and *''av'' (or *''aw'').{{sfnp|Subrahmanyam|1983}}{{sfnp|Zvelebil|1990}}{{sfnp|Krishnamurti|2003|p=90}}\nThe five-vowel system is largely preserved in the descendent subgroups.{{sfnp|Krishnamurti|2003|p=48}}\n\nThe following consonantal phonemes are reconstructed:{{sfnp|Subrahmanyam|1983|p=40}}{{sfnp|Zvelebil|1990}}{{sfnp|Krishnamurti|2003|p=91}}\n{| class=\"wikitable Unicode\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n! !!

This was Wigan's only notable effort in the first half as errors, such as this one, from both teams cost them opportunities.\n\nHowever, in the 21st minute, Warrington did score, thanks to a try from [[Declan Patton]], who was only making his 9th appearance of the season.

However, referee Robert Hicks sent the final decision to [[Television Match Official|Video Referee]] [[Ben Thaler]], as he couldn't see whether or not the ball was grounded on the try-line, after 5 Wigan players were tackling Atkins. Eventually after a short delay, Hicks' initial TRY decision was overturned by video referee, Ben Thaler, due to Atkins seen losing control of the ball before he could get it down.<ref>{{citeweb|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-league/2016/10/08/josh-charnley-signs-off-with-wigan-winner-in-super-league-grand|title=Josh Charnley signs off with Wigan winner in Super League Grand Final|date=8 October 2016|work=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=10 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nA minute later, [[Liam Farrell]] broke Warrington's defensive line, and then gave a pass off to [[Oliver Gildart]], who'd go on to score the 100th Super League Grand Final try. After kicking from a wide angle, [[Matty Smith]] was unable to convert and the scores remained level.\n\nIn the 63rd minute, [[Josh Charnley]] wasn't denied this time around, scoring after grounding the departing team member [[Dan Sarginson]]'s grubber in the in-goal area. Matty Smith again had to convert from out wide, but he again failed to capitalise on the extra 2 points.\n\nSmith then finally added another two points, courtesy of a penalty goal, conceded by [[Daryl Clark]]. The penalty-goal made the score 12\u20136 to Wigan with only 6 minutes remaining. After this moment, all the chances belonged to Warrington, but Wigan's defence stood up when it mattered most, tackling players out of play and tackling them on the 5th tackle, to create a turnover each time.

Matty Smith again had to convert from out wide, but he again failed to capitalise on the extra 2 points.\n\nSmith then finally added another two points, courtesy of a penalty goal, conceded by [[Daryl Clark]]. The penalty-goal made the score 12\u20136 to Wigan with only 6 minutes remaining.

Players can move along platforms, fall to lower ones, and jump to higher ones and over gaps. Each level is limited to a single screen, with no scrolling; however, if a screen has gaps in its bottom edge, players can fall through these and reappear at the top. Each level has a certain number of enemies that must be defeated in order to advance. The players must blow bubbles to trap the enemies, then burst these bubbles by colliding with them. Each enemy defeated in this manner turns into a food item that can be picked up for extra points. Defeating multiple enemies at once awards higher scores and causes more valuable food items to appear. All bubbles will float for a certain length of time before bursting on their own; players can jump on these and ride them to otherwise inaccessible areas.<ref name = \"rgamer08\"/> Magic items appear from time to time and grant special abilities and advantages when picked up. Special bubbles occasionally appear that can be burst to attack enemies with fire, water, or lightning. Furthermore, if a player collects letter bubbles to form ''extend'', a bonus life is earned and both players immediately advance to the next level.\n\nA player loses one life upon touching any free enemies or their projectiles (rocks, fireballs, lasers, bottles).  Enemies turn \"angry\"\u2014turning pink in color and moving faster\u2014if they escape from a bubble after being left too long or the players spend a certain amount of time on the current level. They return to normal if either player loses a life. After a further time limit expires, an additional invincible enemy appears for each player, actively chasing them using only vertical and horizontal movements. These disappear once the level is cleared, or when a player loses a life. When there is only one enemy left, it immediately becomes angry and remains in this state until defeated.\n\nIn the 100th and final level, players face a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]].<ref name = \"rgamer08\"/><ref name = \"rgamer95\"/><ref name = \"rgamer28\">{{citation | title=The Definitive - Bubble Bobble | journal=Retro Gamer | issue=28 | pages=58\u201368 | date= July 2006 | first = Stuart | last = Campbell | publisher = [[Imagine Publishing]] }}</ref> This is one of the first games to feature multiple endings. Completing Level 100 in single-player mode reveals a message stating that the game has not truly ended and a hint to the player: \"Come here with your friend.\" If two players complete the game, they see a \"happy end\", in which the brothers are transformed to their human selves and reunited with their girlfriends. This ending also includes a code that, when deciphered, allows the game to be played in the faster and more difficult \"super\" mode.

Players can move along platforms, fall to lower ones, and jump to higher ones and over gaps. Each level is limited to a single screen, with no scrolling; however, if a screen has gaps in its bottom edge, players can fall through these and reappear at the top. Each level has a certain number of enemies that must be defeated in order to advance. The players must blow bubbles to trap the enemies, then burst these bubbles by colliding with them. Each enemy defeated in this manner turns into a food item that can be picked up for extra points. Defeating multiple enemies at once awards higher scores and causes more valuable food items to appear. All bubbles will float for a certain length of time before bursting on their own; players can jump on these and ride them to otherwise inaccessible areas.<ref name = \"rgamer08\"/> Magic items appear from time to time and grant special abilities and advantages when picked up. Special bubbles occasionally appear that can be burst to attack enemies with fire, water, or lightning. Furthermore, if a player collects letter bubbles to form ''extend'', a bonus life is earned and both players immediately advance to the next level.\n\nA player loses one life upon touching any free enemies or their projectiles (rocks, fireballs, lasers, bottles).  Enemies turn \"angry\"\u2014turning pink in color and moving faster\u2014if they escape from a bubble after being left too long or the players spend a certain amount of time on the current level. They return to normal if either player loses a life. After a further time limit expires, an additional invincible enemy appears for each player, actively chasing them using only vertical and horizontal movements. These disappear once the level is cleared, or when a player loses a life. When there is only one enemy left, it immediately becomes angry and remains in this state until defeated.\n\nIn the 100th and final level, players face a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]].<ref name = \"rgamer08\"/><ref name = \"rgamer95\"/><ref name = \"rgamer28\">{{citation | title=The Definitive - Bubble Bobble | journal=Retro Gamer | issue=28 | pages=58\u201368 | date= July 2006 | first = Stuart | last = Campbell | publisher = [[Imagine Publishing]] }}</ref> This is one of the first games to feature multiple endings.

\u00d3 Searcaigh''' (born 12 July 1956), is a modern [[Irish language]] poet. His work has been widely translated, anthologised and studied. \"His confident internationalism\", according to [[Theo Dorgan]],<ref name=\"dorgan\">{{cite book|title=Irish Poetry Since Kavanagh |url=https://archive.org/details/irishpoetrysince00dorg |url-access=registration |first=Theo |last=Dorgan|year=1996|publisher=Four Courts Press|isbn=9781851822393 |page= |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> has channelled \"new modes, new possibilities, into the writing of Irish language poetry in our time\".\n\nFrom 1975 onwards he has produced poetry, plays, and travelogues. His early poetry deals with place, tongue and tradition, with his late work showing a broader scope. His work includes homoerotic love poems.

Tom Walsh, his English teacher at the Gairmscoil in Gortahork, encouraged him to write.\n\n==Personal life==\nIn the early 1970s he worked as a barman in London. Later he attended the NIHE ([[National Institute for Higher Education]]) in Limerick where he did European Studies for two years (1973\u201375) and followed that with one year at [[Maynooth University]] (1977\u201378) where he did Celtic Studies.\n\nDuring the years 1978-81 he worked in Dublin with [[RT\u00c9]] television presenting ''Aisling Gheal'', an arts and music programme directed by musician [[Tony MacMahon]].

Jellinek was a businessman and marketing strategist who promoted \"horseless\" Daimler automobiles among the highest circles of society in his adopted home, which, at that time, was a meeting place for the \"Haute Vol\u00e9e\" of France and Europe, especially in winter. His customers included the Rothschild family and other well-known personalities. But Jellinek's plans went further: as early as 1901, he was selling Mercedes cars in the New World as well, including  US billionaires Rockefeller, Astor, Morgan, and Taylor. At a race in Nice in 1899, Jellinek drove under the pseudonym \"Monsieur Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s\", a way of concealing the competitor's real name as was normal and very regularly done in those days. The race ranks as the hour of birth of the Mercedes-Benz brand. In 1901, the name \"Mercedes\" was registered by Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft (DMG) worldwide as a protected trademark.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko/Global-design-network-Mercedes-Benz-opens-new-Advanced-Design-Centre.xhtml?oid=32352369|publisher=Daimler|title=Global design network: Mercedes-Benz opens new Advanced Design Centre}}</ref> The first Mercedes-Benz [[brand name]] vehicles were produced in 1926, following the merger of Karl Benz's and Gottlieb Daimler's companies into the Daimler-Benz company on 28 June of the same year.<ref name=MBoverview/><ref name=Markenregister/>\n\nGottlieb Daimler was born on 17 March 1834 in Schorndorf.

Also used for electric models and plug-in hybrids.\n* \"G\" was originally used for the [[Mercedes-Benz G-Class|Gel\u00e4ndewagen]] off-road vehicle, but is now applied to Mercedes SUVs in general (G, GLA, GLC, GLE, and GLS).\n* \"K\" was used in the 1930s, indicating a supercharger (\"Kompressor\") equipped engine. Three exceptions : the SLK, SSK and CLK, where K indicates \"Kurz\" (short-wheelbase) (though the SLK<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/a26543/mr-regular-mercedes-slk-230/|title=The Mercedes SLK230 Is the Rich Man's Miata|last=Regular|first=Mr|date=2015-08-31|website=Road & Track|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-16}}</ref> and SSK had a supercharger).\n* \"L\" indicates \"Leicht\" (lightweight) for sporting models and \"Lang\" (long-wheelbase) for sedan models.\n* \"R\" indicates \"Rennen\" (racing), used for racing cars (for example, the [[Mercedes-Benz 300SLR|300SLR]]).\n* \"S\" Sonderklasse \"Special class\" for flagship models, including the S-Class, and SL-Class, SLR McLaren, and SLS sports cars.\n* \"T\" indicates \"Touring\" and an estate (or station wagon) body style.\n\nSome models in the 1950s also had lower-case letters (b, c, and d) to indicate specific trim levels. For other models, the numeric part of the designation does not match the engine displacement. This was done to show the model's position in the model range independent of displacement or in the price matrix. For these vehicles, the actual displacement in litres is suffixed to the model designation. An exception was the [[Mercedes-Benz W201|190-class]] with the numeric designation of \"190\" as to denote its entry-level in the model along with the displacement label on the right side of the boot (190E 2.3 for 2.3-litre 4-cylinder petrol motor, 190D 2.5 for 2.5-litre 5-cylinder diesel motor, and so forth). Some older models (such as the SS and SSK) did not have a number as part of the designation at all.\n\nFor the 1994 model year, Mercedes-Benz revised the naming system. Models were divided into \"classes\" denoted by an arrangement of up to three letters (see \"Current model range\" above), followed by a three-digit (or two-digit for AMG models, with the number approximately equal to the displacement in litres multiplied by 10) number related to the engine displacement as before. Variants of the same model such as an estate version or a vehicle with a diesel engine are no longer given a separate letter. The SLR and SLS supercars do not carry a numerical designation.\n\nToday, many numerical designations no longer reflect the engine's actual displacement, but more of the relative performance and marketing position. Despite its engine displacement in two litres, the powerplant in the A45 AMG produces 355 brake horsepower so the designation is higher as to indicate the greater performance.

Jellinek was a businessman and marketing strategist who promoted \"horseless\" Daimler automobiles among the highest circles of society in his adopted home, which, at that time, was a meeting place for the \"Haute Vol\u00e9e\" of France and Europe, especially in winter. His customers included the Rothschild family and other well-known personalities. But Jellinek's plans went further: as early as 1901, he was selling Mercedes cars in the New World as well, including  US billionaires Rockefeller, Astor, Morgan, and Taylor. At a race in Nice in 1899, Jellinek drove under the pseudonym \"Monsieur Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s\", a way of concealing the competitor's real name as was normal and very regularly done in those days. The race ranks as the hour of birth of the Mercedes-Benz brand. In 1901, the name \"Mercedes\" was registered by Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft (DMG) worldwide as a protected trademark.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko/Global-design-network-Mercedes-Benz-opens-new-Advanced-Design-Centre.xhtml?oid=32352369|publisher=Daimler|title=Global design network: Mercedes-Benz opens new Advanced Design Centre}}</ref> The first Mercedes-Benz [[brand name]] vehicles were produced in 1926, following the merger of Karl Benz's and Gottlieb Daimler's companies into the Daimler-Benz company on 28 June of the same year.<ref name=MBoverview/><ref name=Markenregister/>\n\nGottlieb Daimler was born on 17 March 1834 in Schorndorf.

Also used for electric models and plug-in hybrids.\n* \"G\" was originally used for the [[Mercedes-Benz G-Class|Gel\u00e4ndewagen]] off-road vehicle, but is now applied to Mercedes SUVs in general (G, GLA, GLC, GLE, and GLS).\n* \"K\" was used in the 1930s, indicating a supercharger (\"Kompressor\") equipped engine. Three exceptions : the SLK, SSK and CLK, where K indicates \"Kurz\" (short-wheelbase) (though the SLK<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/a26543/mr-regular-mercedes-slk-230/|title=The Mercedes SLK230 Is the Rich Man's Miata|last=Regular|first=Mr|date=2015-08-31|website=Road & Track|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-16}}</ref> and SSK had a supercharger).\n* \"L\" indicates \"Leicht\" (lightweight) for sporting models and \"Lang\" (long-wheelbase) for sedan models.\n* \"R\" indicates \"Rennen\" (racing), used for racing cars (for example, the [[Mercedes-Benz 300SLR|300SLR]]).\n* \"S\" Sonderklasse \"Special class\" for flagship models, including the S-Class, and SL-Class, SLR McLaren, and SLS sports cars.\n* \"T\" indicates \"Touring\" and an estate (or station wagon) body style.\n\nSome models in the 1950s also had lower-case letters (b, c, and d) to indicate specific trim levels. For other models, the numeric part of the designation does not match the engine displacement. This was done to show the model's position in the model range independent of displacement or in the price matrix. For these vehicles, the actual displacement in litres is suffixed to the model designation. An exception was the [[Mercedes-Benz W201|190-class]] with the numeric designation of \"190\" as to denote its entry-level in the model along with the displacement label on the right side of the boot (190E 2.3 for 2.3-litre 4-cylinder petrol motor, 190D 2.5 for 2.5-litre 5-cylinder diesel motor, and so forth). Some older models (such as the SS and SSK) did not have a number as part of the designation at all.\n\nFor the 1994 model year, Mercedes-Benz revised the naming system. Models were divided into \"classes\" denoted by an arrangement of up to three letters (see \"Current model range\" above), followed by a three-digit (or two-digit for AMG models, with the number approximately equal to the displacement in litres multiplied by 10) number related to the engine displacement as before. Variants of the same model such as an estate version or a vehicle with a diesel engine are no longer given a separate letter. The SLR and SLS supercars do not carry a numerical designation.\n\nToday, many numerical designations no longer reflect the engine's actual displacement, but more of the relative performance and marketing position. Despite its engine displacement in two litres, the powerplant in the A45 AMG produces 355 brake horsepower so the designation is higher as to indicate the greater performance. Another example is the E250 CGI having greater performance than the E200 CGI due to the different engine tuning even though both have 1.8-litre engines. From the marketing perspective, E200 seems more \"upscale\" than E180. Recent AMG models use the \"63\" designation (in honor of the 1960s 6.3-litre [[Mercedes-Benz M100 engine|M100]] engine) despite being equipped with either a 6.2-litre ([[Mercedes-Benz M156 engine|M156]]), a 5.5-litre ([[Mercedes-Benz M278 engine|M157]]) or even a 4.0-litre engine.\n\nSome models carry further designations indicating special features:\n* \"[[4MATIC]]\" indicates the vehicle is equipped with [[Four-wheel drive|all-wheel-drive]].\n* \"[[BlueTec|BlueTEC]]\" indicates a diesel engine with [[selective catalytic reduction]] exhaust aftertreatment.\n* \"BlueEFFICIENCY\" indicates special fuel economy features (direct injection, [[start-stop system]], aerodynamic modifications, etc.)\n* \"CGI\" (Charged Gasoline Injection) indicates [[Direct fuel injection|direct gasoline injection]].\n* \"CDI\" (Common-rail Direct Injection) indicates a [[Common rail|common-rail]] diesel engine.\n* \"Hybrid\" indicates a petrol- or diesel-electric [[Hybrid vehicle|hybrid]].\n* \"NGT\" indicates a natural gas-fueled engine.\n* \"Kompressor\" indicates a [[supercharger|supercharged]] engine.\n* \"Turbo\" indicates a [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] engine, only used on A-, B-,E- and GLK-Class models.\n* \"AMG Line\" indicates the interior or engine, depending which car, has been fitted with the luxuries of their AMG sports cars\n\nModel designation badges can be removed at the request of the customer.\n\n====2015 and beyond====\nRationalisation of the model nomenclature was announced in November 2014 for future models.<ref>{{cite web | last = Ewing | first = Steven | date = 11 November 2014 | url = http://www.autoblog.com/2014/11/11/mercedes-name-changes-gl-maybach/ | title = Mercedes renames utility vehicles, repositions Maybach as sub-brand | publisher = [[Autoblog.com]] | accessdate = 12 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://media.daimler.com/dcmedia/0-921-1760651-1-1760337-1-0-0-0-0-1-0-0-0-1-0-0-0-0-0.html?TS=1415752768119 | title = Mercedes-Benz expands brand world and introduces new nomenclature: Mercedes-Maybach for the ultimate in exclusivity and individuality | publisher = [[Daimler AG]] | date = 11 November 2014 | accessdate = 12 November 2014 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141112050328/http://media.daimler.com/dcmedia/0-921-1760651-1-1760337-1-0-0-0-0-1-0-0-0-1-0-0-0-0-0.html?TS=1415752768119 | archive-date = 12 November 2014 | url-status=dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref> The changes consolidate many confusing nomenclature and their placements in the model range such as CL-Class is now called the S-Class Coup\u00e9.
