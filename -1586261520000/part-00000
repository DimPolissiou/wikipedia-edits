Out of the dam Coralie B., his damsire Apprehension was a grandson of [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing#United Kingdom|English Triple Crown]] champion,  [[Rock Sand]].\n\nArise was purchased by Harry Addison, Sr. and Mrs. Jack Addison of [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]] from breeder R. M. Wood in 1946. They entrusted the colt's race conditioning to future Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame trainer, [[James C. Bentley|Jim Bentley]].\n\n==Racing career==\nIn 1948 the two-year-old Arise was sent south to race in [[New York (state)|New York State]] where he won twice and was notably second in the [[Youthful Stakes]], a race that at the time was one of the most important of the year for juveniles. As a three-year-old in 1949, Arise earned wins in important both Canada and the United States. At [[Toronto|Toronto's]] [[Thorncliffe Park#Thorncliffe Park Raceway|Thorncliffe Park Raceway]] he set a track record for six furlongs and at [[Long Branch Racetrack]] he won the [[Canadian International Stakes|Canadian Championship Stakes]]. Racing in the United States, at New York's [[Saratoga Race Course]] Arise captured the [[Travers Stakes]], marking the first-ever win in that prestigious race by a Canadian-owned horse. In the [[Jerome Handicap]], he finished second by a nose to [[Capot]]. At age four, Arise continue to perform with the best.

However, it resulted in a disappointing loss to the underdog [[New York Jets]] in overtime in [[2004\u201305 NFL playoffs|2005]].\n\nDuring the [[2005 NFL Draft]], the Chargers tried to get some key rookies that would help carry the momentum from their mostly successful 2004\u201305 run.  They used their first pick on LB [[Shawne Merriman|Shawne \"Lights Out\" Merriman]] from the University of Maryland.  Then, they used their next pick on DT [[Luis Castillo (football player)|Luis Castillo]] from Northwestern University.  Their other choices were WR [[Vincent Jackson]] from Northern Colorado, RB [[Darren Sproles]] from Kansas State, OT [[Wesley Britt]] from University of Alabama, OT [[Wes Sims (American football)|Wes Sims]] from Oklahoma University, and Center [[Scott Mruczkowski]] from Bowling Green State.\n\nThe Chargers got off to a rough start in their 2005 campaign, losing a close one to the [[Dallas Cowboys]] in their Week 1 home-opener (28\u201324) and then they lost on the road to their AFC West rival, the [[Denver Broncos]] (20\u201317).  It wasn't until a Week 3 home game on Sunday night that they got their first win of the season, when [[Eli Manning]] and the [[New York Giants]] got \"shocked to the system\" as [[LaDainian Tomlinson]] had one of the greatest games of his career.  He got 220 total yards, had 3 rushing touchdowns, and threw for a touchdown as he helped the Chargers win 45\u201323.\n\nA week later, they were able to build off their win by not only beating the two-time defending champion [[New England Patriots]] 41\u201317, but also ending the Pats' 21-game winning streak at home. In their Week 5 Monday Night home game against the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], the Chargers wore their throw-back uniforms during this season (they had also worn them during the 1994 season). The Steelers held on to win with a 40-yard field goal by [[Jeff Reed (football player)|Jeff Reed]] (24\u201322). The Chargers rebounded on the road against their division rival [[Oakland Raiders]] (27\u201314). In their Week 7 road trip to Philadelphia, they hoped to build off their win against the Eagles. Late in the game, with the Chargers leading 17\u201313, the Chargers tried to go for a field goal to put their lead well out of reach, but it got blocked and Eagles DB [[Matt Ware]] returned it 65 yards for the game-winning touchdown and the Chargers fourth loss of the season.\n\nAfter going 3\u20134, the Chargers turned things around as they began a five-game winning streak. They won at home against division-rival [[Kansas City Chiefs]] (28\u201320) and on the road against the [[New York Jets]] (31\u201326). Coming off their Week 10 bye, they went home and wore their throw-back uniforms again. This time, it was a dominating performance as the Chargers man-handled the [[Buffalo Bills]], 48\u201310. Then, they went on the road and won a close match against the [[Washington Redskins]] (23\u201317 in OT) and then they swept the Oakland Raiders at home by a score of 34\u201310.\n\nThe Chargers were 8\u20135, coming off a 23\u201321 loss to the [[Miami Dolphins]]. On December 18, the Chargers beat the undefeated [[Indianapolis Colts]] 26\u201317, snapping a 13\u20130 winning streak. However, despite a record of 9\u20136, they were officially eliminated from AFC playoff contention in 2005 after a 20\u20137 loss to the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] the following Saturday. The Chargers lost their final game of the season by a score of 23\u20137 to the AFC West champion Denver Broncos to finish with a record of 9\u20137.\n\n===2006\u20132009===\n[[File:Philip_Rivers_2014.JPG|right|upright|thumbnail|Philip Rivers has started every game at quarterback since [[2006 San Diego Chargers season|2006]].]]\nThe Chargers delivered an impressive performance in [[2006 San Diego Chargers season|2006]], losing only to the Ravens and Chiefs; they finished 14\u20132 which secured them the #1 AFC seed in the playoffs. However, they lost 24-21 to the [[New England Patriots]] in the divisional round. Following the 2006 season, they replaced Schottenheimer with new head coach [[Norv Turner]]. In [[2007 San Diego Chargers season|2007]], they went 11-5, beating the [[Tennessee Titans]] and the defending champion [[Indianapolis Colts]] to reach the AFC title game. However, they fell to the Patriots for the second year in a row. In [[2008 San Diego Chargers season|2008]], the Chargers dropped to 8\u20138, but as the [[AFC West]] was unusually weak that year, they still managed to win the division title. Defeating the Colts in the wild card round, they lost to the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] in the divisional round.\n\nSan Diego began the [[2009 San Diego Chargers season|2009 season]] 2\u20133. After losing to the Broncos on Monday night, they began an unbroken winning streak for the rest of the season, which included defeating the entire [[NFC East]]. In Week 11, they avenged their earlier loss against the Broncos by inflicting a 32\u20133 rout on them. The next game saw them beat a 1\u201311 [[Cleveland Browns]] squad 30-23, in which [[LaDainian Tomlinson]] broke Hall of Famer [[Jim Brown]]'s rushing record and was congratulated by him afterwards. The Chargers secured another division title, the #2 AFC seed, and looked to be a near shoo-in for the [[Super Bowl]]. However, the team's postseason futility continued. Hosting the [[New York Jets]] on January 17, 2010, they endured an upset defeat, where, despite an early lead, were unable to overcome the strong Jets' defense. Kicker [[Nate Kaeding]] also missed three field goal and PAT attempts, which resulted in the Chargers losing 17\u201314.\n\n===2010\u20132012: End of the Norv Turner/A.J.

The losses were due to turnovers & mental mistakes by young players on special teams allowing blocked punts & kick/punt return touchdowns.

From that point on, however, the Chargers began a six-game skid with losses to the [[New York Jets|Jets]], [[Kansas City Chiefs|Chiefs]], [[Green Bay Packers|Packers]], [[Oakland Raiders|Raiders]], [[Chicago Bears|Bears]], and [[Denver Broncos|Broncos]], with the first four by only a score and against Denver in overtime. Injuries to both the offensive and the defensive line hit the Chargers hard. But finally on December 5, 2011, the Chargers got their first win in over a month against the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]], beating the also-struggling team. \nThe Chargers then began a three-game winning streak most notably beating the Ravens by more than any team has beat them that season.\nHowever, the Chargers were beaten, 38\u201310, by the [[Detroit Lions]] to drop their record to 7\u20138 and eliminate the possibility of being in the playoffs.

However, the Chargers were beaten out by Denver for the Division Title via tie-breaker.

They entered the playoffs as the sixth seed. On January 5, 2014, the Chargers defeated the [[2013 Cincinnati Bengals season|Cincinnati Bengals]] at [[Paul Brown Stadium]] (27-10) to advance to the AFC Divisional Playoff Round. The Chargers then lost to the [[2013 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] at [[Sports Authority Field at Mile High]] the following Sunday, January 12, 2014 (24-17).\n\nAfter starting the season strongly, including a five-win run in September and October, the Chargers were beset by a string of injuries to key players, and eventually finished the season at 9-7. In contrast to 2013, the record was not enough to make the playoffs. The Chargers began the season 5\u20131, winning five straight after losing their season opener. It was followed by a three-game losing streak, and they finished 4\u20134 in the second half. They won just two of their final five games, coming back from double-digit fourth quarter deficits twice to remain in playoff contention. They lost the final game of the season when a win would have secured a playoff berth. In three of their last four games, and five of their last eight, the Chargers did not score more than one touchdown. Compared to 2013, the offense dropped in points (from 12th in the league to 17th), yards (5th to 18th), first downs (3rd to 15th), net yards per pass (2nd to 8th), rushing yards (13th to 30) and yards per rush (21st to 31st). It was the second time in three years the team finished second-to-last in yards per carry. San Diego was just 2\u20134 against teams in their division in the AFC West, and were swept by both the Denver Broncos and the Kansas City Chiefs. It was their worst intradivision record since they were 1\u20135 in 2003. The Chargers were only 3\u20136 against teams with winning records. They matched their 9\u20137 record from 2013, but missed the playoffs for the fourth time in five seasons.\n\nDuring the season, the Chargers, the [[St. Louis Rams]], and the [[Oakland Raiders]] all intimated they might apply for relocation to Los Angeles at the end of the season. The Chargers announced in December 2014 that they would not be seeking to relocate for the 2015 season, followed by an announcement from the NFL that no team would relocate to L.A. until the 2016 season at the earliest.<ref>{{cite news|last=Florio|first=Mike|title=2016 becomes the target for an L.A. move|url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2014/12/20/2016-becomes-the-target-for-an-l-a-move/|work=ProFootballTalk|date=December 20, 2014|accessdate=January 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\nControversy filled the 2015 offseason, as attorney and team spokesperson Mark Fabiani continually bashed the local San Diego city government's efforts to negotiate a replacement for Qualcomm Stadium.

In their six straight losses, they lost heartbreakers to the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], [[Green Bay Packers]], [[Baltimore Ravens]] and the [[Chicago Bears]], as well as sound defeats by both, division rivals, the [[Oakland Raiders]] and the [[Kansas City Chiefs]]. They finally broke their losing streak by defeating the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] on the road, bringing their record to 3\u20138, in last place in the [[AFC West]] and 3rd worst in the [[American Football Conference]] (one game ahead of both the Browns and the [[Tennessee Titans]]).

During its period in the AFL, the club also used a shield logo that featured a horsehead, a lightning bolt, and the word \"Chargers\". The team brought the logo back for on-field design in the 2018 season.\n\nFrom 1960 to 1973, the colors consisted of various shades of Electric blue (\"powder\" blue, but technically called Collegiate blue){{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} or white jerseys, both with gold lightning bolts on the shoulders. The helmets were white and had both the arc-shaped lightning bolt logo, in gold or navy depending on the year, and the player's number. At first, the team wore white pants before switching to gold in 1966. In 1973, the numerals on the blue jerseys changed from white to gold.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}\n\nIn [[1974 San Diego Chargers season|1974]], the sky blue was changed to dark royal blue. The helmet was also changed to dark blue and the players' numbers were removed. Additionally, the face masks became yellow, thus making them one of the first teams in the NFL (with the Kansas City Chiefs) to use a facemask color other than the then-predominant grey. From [[1978 San Diego Chargers season|1978]] through [[1983 San Diego Chargers season|1983]], the Chargers wore their white jerseys at home, coinciding with the hiring of coach Don Coryell&nbsp;\u2013 when [[Joe Gibbs]], a Coryell assistant in 1979\u201380, became head coach of the [[Washington Redskins]] in 1981, he did the same, and white at home became a Redskins staple through 2007 \u2013 but Coryell switched the Chargers to their blue jerseys at home starting in [[1984 San Diego Chargers season|1984]]. With the exception of the [[1991 San Diego Chargers season|1991 season]] and other sporadic home games since, San Diego wears its blue jerseys at home.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}\n\nIn [[1985 San Diego Chargers season|1985]], the Chargers started using navy blue jerseys and returned to wearing white pants. The team's uniform design was next revamped in 1988. It featured an even darker shade of navy blue. The lightning bolts on the jerseys and helmets were white, with navy interior trim and gold outlining; the facemasks became navy blue. In [[1990 San Diego Chargers season|1990]], the team started to wear navy pants with their white jerseys. From [[1988 San Diego Chargers season|1988]] to [[1991 San Diego Chargers season|1991]], the team displayed stripes down the pants rather than lightning bolts. The Chargers went with all-white combinations in [[1997 San Diego Chargers season|1997]] and [[2001 San Diego Chargers season|2001]], only to have the blue pants make a comeback. On October 27, 2003, the Chargers wore their navy pants with their navy jersey for a ''Monday Night Football'' game versus the [[Miami Dolphins]] that was played at [[Sun Devil Stadium]], then the home of the [[Arizona Cardinals]], due to wildfires in southern California. This remains the only game in which the Chargers have worn the all-dark combination.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}|\n\nFrom the late 1980s to 2000, the Chargers wore white at home during some preseason games and dark for regular season games. In [[2001 San Diego Chargers season|2001]], the Chargers started wearing their dark uniforms for preseason games and white uniforms in September home games due to the heat before switching back to dark in October.\n\nIn March 2007, the Chargers unveiled their first uniform redesign since 1988, on the team's official website. The team formally unveiled this new uniform set, which mixes old and new styles, in a private team-only event. Navy blue remains the primary color on the home jersey, but the familiar lightning bolt was reverted to gold, and now has navy outlining and powder blue interior trim. The latter color is a nod to the 1960s uniforms. The redesigned lightning bolt was moved to the sides of the shoulders from the top, and includes a new numbering font and word mark in white, with gold outlining and powder blue interior trim. The pants also have a redesigned lightning bolt in gold, with powder blue trim on a navy stripe. Additionally, the team pays tribute to other uniform features from their history by wearing a metallic white helmet, with a navy face mask, the newly revamped bolt in gold with navy and powder blue trim, and white pants. The road white jerseys with navy pants, as well as the alternate powder blue jerseys with white pants, were also redesigned with the new scheme.<ref>{{cite news|title=Chargers Unveil New Uniforms|url=http://www.chargers.com/news/2007/03/14/chargers-unveil-new-uniforms|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=Chargers.com|date=March 14, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160811143337/https://www.chargers.com/news/2007/03/14/chargers-unveil-new-uniforms|archive-date=August 11, 2016|access-date=June 10, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nFrom [[2002 San Diego Chargers season|2002]] to [[2006 San Diego Chargers season|2006]], the Chargers used the early-1960s powder blue uniforms as alternate jerseys, which many football fans (both of the Chargers and of other teams) clamored for the team to bring back full-time.\n\nSince [[2007 San Diego Chargers season|2007]], the Chargers have worn the alternate powder blue jerseys twice per season.

There are few recognized guidelines in sports regarding retiring numbers, and the NFL has no specific league policy.  \"You have to have enough numbers for players to wear\", said NFL spokesman Greg Aiello.<ref name=\"sullivan_03042010\">{{cite news|last=Sullivan |first=Tim |title=Retiring a number can be tricky math problem |date=March 4, 2010 |newspaper=The San Diego Union Tribune |url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2010/mar/04/retiring-number-tricky-math-sullivan/?print&page=all |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20121209005200/http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2010/mar/04/retiring-number-tricky-math-sullivan/?print&page=all |archivedate=December 9, 2012 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> The Chargers have rarely retired numbers.<ref name=\"schofield\">{{cite news|last=Scholfield|first=Steve|title=Chargers to honor AFL icon Alworth|date=July 14, 2005|newspaper=North County Times|url=http://www.nctimes.com/sports/columnists/scholfield/article_f4af5516-4838-5fc0-b49e-5c50de637f2f.html|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130104014613/http://www.nctimes.com/sports/columnists/scholfield/article_f4af5516-4838-5fc0-b49e-5c50de637f2f.html|url-status=dead|archivedate=January 4, 2013}}</ref> The ''[[San Diego Union-Tribune]]'' wrote, \"The [Chargers] tend to honor their heritage haphazardly.\"<ref name=\"sullivan_08152006\">{{cite news|last=Sullivan|first=Tim|title=This time, icon finally receives proper sendoff|date=August 15, 2006|newspaper=The San Diego Union-Tribune|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060815/news_1s15sullivan.html|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130202061617/http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060815/news_1s15sullivan.html|url-status=dead|archivedate=February 2, 2013}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Los Angeles Chargers}};\"|'''Los Angeles Chargers retired numbers'''\n|-\n!

Packer replaced legendary P.A. announcer Bruce Binkowski, who went on to become the executive director of the Holiday and Poinsettia Bowl games, which are played at their former home, [[SDCCU Stadium]].\n\nWith the Chargers' return to Los Angeles in 2017, the team became a beneficiary of league scheduling policies. Both the Chargers and the [[Los Angeles Rams]] share the Los Angeles market, which is on the West Coast of the United States. This means that the Chargers cannot play home games, road division games against the [[Denver Broncos]] or [[Las Vegas Raiders]], or interconference road games against the [[NFC West]] (in seasons that the [[AFC West]] and NFC West meet in interconference play) in the early 10:00&nbsp;a.m. [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific time]] slot. In addition, they cannot play interconference home games at the same time or network as the Rams. As a result, both teams generally will have more limited scheduling options, and will also benefit by receiving more prime-time games than usual ([[National Football League on television#Chargers and Rams|click here]] for further information). Thus, regardless of the previous season's record, the Chargers will receive a disproportionate number of ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night]]'', ''[[Monday Night Football|Monday Night]]'' and/or ''[[Thursday Night Football|Thursday Night]]'' games, compared to the rest of the league. Additionally, if the Chargers and Rams are both playing at the same time on Sunday afternoons on a certain network (for instance, a Rams road game against an AFC opponent at the same time as a Charger home game with an NFC opponent with both on Fox, or the reverse where the Rams are on the road against an AFC opponent and the Chargers are at home against an AFC opponent on CBS), in the Los Angeles market, Fox and CBS have authorization to carry the extra game on their secondary sister stations; Fox games air on [[KCOP-TV]], while CBS games are aired on [[KCAL-TV]]. In 2020, the Chargers signed a multi-year preseason TV deal with [[KCBS-TV]] and [[KCAL-TV]] and will have a weekly show with the latest team news, replacing [[KABC-TV]] after three seasons (2017, 2018 and 2019) of televising Chargers preseason football. \n\n===Radio affiliates===\n[[File: San Diego Chargers radio affiliates.png|thumb|Map of radio affiliates]]\n[https://www.chargers.com/news/chargers-radio-network Chargers Radio Network]\n[http://www.chargers.com/news/2017/07/28/chargers-finalize-2017-broadcast-team-and-station-affiliates Chargers Finalize 2017 Broadcast Team and Station Affiliates]\n\n===English stations===\n\n====California====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Los Angeles Chargers|border=2}};\" | City !! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Los Angeles Chargers|border=2}};\" | Call Sign !! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Los Angeles Chargers|border=2}};\" | Frequency\n|-\n| rowspan=5|Los Angeles || [[KFI]] || 640 AM (Previous affiliate from 2017-2020)\n|-\n| [[KOST]] || 103.5 HD2 (HD radio simulcast of [[KFI]], Previous affiliate from 2017-2020)\n|-\n| [[KYSR]]/[[KSRY]] || 98.7/103.1 FM (Pre-Game [first two-hours], Full Game Coverage and 'Chargers Talk' Post-Game)\n|-\n| [[KYSR]] || 98.7 HD2 (HD radio simulcast of [[KLAC]], will carry select games)\n|-\n| [[KLAC]] || 570 AM (Secondary affiliate to [[KYSR]], will carry select games)\n|-\n| rowspan=2|[[San Diego]] || [[KGB-FM]] || 101.5 FM\n|-\n| [[KLSD]] || 1360 AM\n|-\n| [[Temecula, California|Temecula]]/[[Inland Empire]] || [[KATY-FM]] || 101.3 FM\n|-\n| [[Yucca Valley, California|Yucca Valley]] || [[KNWH]] || 1250 AM\n|-\n| [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]] || [[KNWZ]] || 94.3 FM\n|-\n| [[Palmdale, California|Palmdale]]/[[Lancaster, California|Lancaster]] || [[KAVL]] || 610 AM\n|-\n| [[Victorville, California|Victorville]]/[[Hesperia, California|Hesperia]] || [[KMPS (AM)|KMPS]] || 910 AM\n|-\n| [[Imperial Valley]] || [[KXO-FM]] || 107.5 FM \n|}\n\n====Nevada====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Los Angeles Chargers|border=2}};\" | City !! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Los Angeles Chargers|border=2}};\" | Call Sign !! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Los Angeles Chargers|border=2}};\" | Frequency\n|-\n| [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] || [[KKGK]] || 1340 AM\n|}\n\n===Spanish stations===\n\n====California====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Los Angeles Chargers|border=2}};\" | City !! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Los Angeles Chargers|border=2}};\" | Call Sign !! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Los Angeles Chargers|border=2}};\" | Frequency\n|-\n| Los Angeles/[[Orange County, California|Orange County]] || [[KFWB]] || 980 AM\n|-\n| [[San Diego]]/[[Tijuana|Tijuana, Mexico]] || [[XEXX-AM]] || 1420 AM\n|}\n\n====Mexico====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Los Angeles Chargers|border=2}};\" | City !! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Los Angeles Chargers|border=2}};\" | Call Sign !! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Los Angeles Chargers|border=2}};\" | Frequency\n|-\n|-\n| [[Mexicali, Mexico|Mexicali]] || [[XEHG-AM|XEHG]] || 1370 AM\n|-\n| [[Ensenada, Mexico|Ensenada]] || [[XHEPF-FM]] || 89.1 FM\n|}\n\n==Theme song==\n{{Main|San Diego Super Chargers}}\n\nThe Chargers' [[fight song]], \"[[San Diego Super Chargers]]\", was recorded in 1979 at the height of the team's success with [[Coryell offense|Air Coryell]], and has a distinctly [[disco]] sound.

However, it resulted in a disappointing loss to the underdog [[New York Jets]] in overtime in [[2004\u201305 NFL playoffs|2005]].\n\nDuring the [[2005 NFL Draft]], the Chargers tried to get some key rookies that would help carry the momentum from their mostly successful 2004\u201305 run.  They used their first pick on LB [[Shawne Merriman|Shawne \"Lights Out\" Merriman]] from the University of Maryland.  Then, they used their next pick on DT [[Luis Castillo (football player)|Luis Castillo]] from Northwestern University.  Their other choices were WR [[Vincent Jackson]] from Northern Colorado, RB [[Darren Sproles]] from Kansas State, OT [[Wesley Britt]] from University of Alabama, OT [[Wes Sims (American football)|Wes Sims]] from Oklahoma University, and Center [[Scott Mruczkowski]] from Bowling Green State.\n\nThe Chargers got off to a rough start in their 2005 campaign, losing a close one to the [[Dallas Cowboys]] in their Week 1 home-opener (28\u201324) and then they lost on the road to their AFC West rival, the [[Denver Broncos]] (20\u201317).  It wasn't until a Week 3 home game on Sunday night that they got their first win of the season, when [[Eli Manning]] and the [[New York Giants]] got \"shocked to the system\" as [[LaDainian Tomlinson]] had one of the greatest games of his career.  He got 220 total yards, had 3 rushing touchdowns, and threw for a touchdown as he helped the Chargers win 45\u201323.\n\nA week later, they were able to build off their win by not only beating the two-time defending champion [[New England Patriots]] 41\u201317, but also ending the Pats' 21-game winning streak at home. In their Week 5 Monday Night home game against the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], the Chargers wore their throw-back uniforms during this season (they had also worn them during the 1994 season). The Steelers held on to win with a 40-yard field goal by [[Jeff Reed (football player)|Jeff Reed]] (24\u201322). The Chargers rebounded on the road against their division rival [[Oakland Raiders]] (27\u201314). In their Week 7 road trip to Philadelphia, they hoped to build off their win against the Eagles. Late in the game, with the Chargers leading 17\u201313, the Chargers tried to go for a field goal to put their lead well out of reach, but it got blocked and Eagles DB [[Matt Ware]] returned it 65 yards for the game-winning touchdown and the Chargers fourth loss of the season.\n\nAfter going 3\u20134, the Chargers turned things around as they began a five-game winning streak. They won at home against division-rival [[Kansas City Chiefs]] (28\u201320) and on the road against the [[New York Jets]] (31\u201326). Coming off their Week 10 bye, they went home and wore their throw-back uniforms again. This time, it was a dominating performance as the Chargers man-handled the [[Buffalo Bills]], 48\u201310. Then, they went on the road and won a close match against the [[Washington Redskins]] (23\u201317 in OT) and then they swept the Oakland Raiders at home by a score of 34\u201310.\n\nThe Chargers were 8\u20135, coming off a 23\u201321 loss to the [[Miami Dolphins]]. On December 18, the Chargers beat the undefeated [[Indianapolis Colts]] 26\u201317, snapping a 13\u20130 winning streak. However, despite a record of 9\u20136, they were officially eliminated from AFC playoff contention in 2005 after a 20\u20137 loss to the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] the following Saturday. The Chargers lost their final game of the season by a score of 23\u20137 to the AFC West champion Denver Broncos to finish with a record of 9\u20137.\n\n===2006\u20132009===\n[[File:Philip_Rivers_2014.JPG|right|upright|thumbnail|Philip Rivers has started every game at quarterback since [[2006 San Diego Chargers season|2006]].]]\nThe Chargers delivered an impressive performance in [[2006 San Diego Chargers season|2006]], losing only to the Ravens and Chiefs; they finished 14\u20132 which secured them the #1 AFC seed in the playoffs. However, they lost 24-21 to the [[New England Patriots]] in the divisional round. Following the 2006 season, they replaced Schottenheimer with new head coach [[Norv Turner]]. In [[2007 San Diego Chargers season|2007]], they went 11-5, beating the [[Tennessee Titans]] and the defending champion [[Indianapolis Colts]] to reach the AFC title game. However, they fell to the Patriots for the second year in a row. In [[2008 San Diego Chargers season|2008]], the Chargers dropped to 8\u20138, but as the [[AFC West]] was unusually weak that year, they still managed to win the division title. Defeating the Colts in the wild card round, they lost to the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] in the divisional round.\n\nSan Diego began the [[2009 San Diego Chargers season|2009 season]] 2\u20133. After losing to the Broncos on Monday night, they began an unbroken winning streak for the rest of the season, which included defeating the entire [[NFC East]]. In Week 11, they avenged their earlier loss against the Broncos by inflicting a 32\u20133 rout on them. The next game saw them beat a 1\u201311 [[Cleveland Browns]] squad 30-23, in which [[LaDainian Tomlinson]] broke Hall of Famer [[Jim Brown]]'s rushing record and was congratulated by him afterwards. The Chargers secured another division title, the #2 AFC seed, and looked to be a near shoo-in for the [[Super Bowl]]. However, the team's postseason futility continued. Hosting the [[New York Jets]] on January 17, 2010, they endured an upset defeat, where, despite an early lead, were unable to overcome the strong Jets' defense. Kicker [[Nate Kaeding]] also missed three field goal and PAT attempts, which resulted in the Chargers losing 17\u201314.\n\n===2010\u20132012: End of the Norv Turner/A.J.

From that point on, however, the Chargers began a six-game skid with losses to the [[New York Jets|Jets]], [[Kansas City Chiefs|Chiefs]], [[Green Bay Packers|Packers]], [[Oakland Raiders|Raiders]], [[Chicago Bears|Bears]], and [[Denver Broncos|Broncos]], with the first four by only a score and against Denver in overtime. Injuries to both the offensive and the defensive line hit the Chargers hard. But finally on December 5, 2011, the Chargers got their first win in over a month against the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]], beating the also-struggling team. \nThe Chargers then began a three-game winning streak most notably beating the Ravens by more than any team has beat them that season.\nHowever, the Chargers were beaten, 38\u201310, by the [[Detroit Lions]] to drop their record to 7\u20138 and eliminate the possibility of being in the playoffs.

The Chargers then lost to the [[2013 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] at [[Sports Authority Field at Mile High]] the following Sunday, January 12, 2014 (24-17).\n\nAfter starting the season strongly, including a five-win run in September and October, the Chargers were beset by a string of injuries to key players, and eventually finished the season at 9-7. In contrast to 2013, the record was not enough to make the playoffs. The Chargers began the season 5\u20131, winning five straight after losing their season opener. It was followed by a three-game losing streak, and they finished 4\u20134 in the second half. They won just two of their final five games, coming back from double-digit fourth quarter deficits twice to remain in playoff contention. They lost the final game of the season when a win would have secured a playoff berth. In three of their last four games, and five of their last eight, the Chargers did not score more than one touchdown. Compared to 2013, the offense dropped in points (from 12th in the league to 17th), yards (5th to 18th), first downs (3rd to 15th), net yards per pass (2nd to 8th), rushing yards (13th to 30) and yards per rush (21st to 31st). It was the second time in three years the team finished second-to-last in yards per carry. San Diego was just 2\u20134 against teams in their division in the AFC West, and were swept by both the Denver Broncos and the Kansas City Chiefs. It was their worst intradivision record since they were 1\u20135 in 2003. The Chargers were only 3\u20136 against teams with winning records. They matched their 9\u20137 record from 2013, but missed the playoffs for the fourth time in five seasons.\n\nDuring the season, the Chargers, the [[St. Louis Rams]], and the [[Oakland Raiders]] all intimated they might apply for relocation to Los Angeles at the end of the season. The Chargers announced in December 2014 that they would not be seeking to relocate for the 2015 season, followed by an announcement from the NFL that no team would relocate to L.A. until the 2016 season at the earliest.<ref>{{cite news|last=Florio|first=Mike|title=2016 becomes the target for an L.A. move|url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2014/12/20/2016-becomes-the-target-for-an-l-a-move/|work=ProFootballTalk|date=December 20, 2014|accessdate=January 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\nControversy filled the 2015 offseason, as attorney and team spokesperson Mark Fabiani continually bashed the local San Diego city government's efforts to negotiate a replacement for Qualcomm Stadium.

In their six straight losses, they lost heartbreakers to the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], [[Green Bay Packers]], [[Baltimore Ravens]] and the [[Chicago Bears]], as well as sound defeats by both, division rivals, the [[Oakland Raiders]] and the [[Kansas City Chiefs]]. They finally broke their losing streak by defeating the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] on the road, bringing their record to 3\u20138, in last place in the [[AFC West]] and 3rd worst in the [[American Football Conference]] (one game ahead of both the Browns and the [[Tennessee Titans]]).

During its period in the AFL, the club also used a shield logo that featured a horsehead, a lightning bolt, and the word \"Chargers\". The team brought the logo back for on-field design in the 2018 season.\n\nFrom 1960 to 1973, the colors consisted of various shades of Electric blue (\"powder\" blue, but technically called Collegiate blue){{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} or white jerseys, both with gold lightning bolts on the shoulders. The helmets were white and had both the arc-shaped lightning bolt logo, in gold or navy depending on the year, and the player's number. At first, the team wore white pants before switching to gold in 1966. In 1973, the numerals on the blue jerseys changed from white to gold.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}\n\nIn [[1974 San Diego Chargers season|1974]], the sky blue was changed to dark royal blue. The helmet was also changed to dark blue and the players' numbers were removed. Additionally, the face masks became yellow, thus making them one of the first teams in the NFL (with the Kansas City Chiefs) to use a facemask color other than the then-predominant grey. From [[1978 San Diego Chargers season|1978]] through [[1983 San Diego Chargers season|1983]], the Chargers wore their white jerseys at home, coinciding with the hiring of coach Don Coryell&nbsp;\u2013 when [[Joe Gibbs]], a Coryell assistant in 1979\u201380, became head coach of the [[Washington Redskins]] in 1981, he did the same, and white at home became a Redskins staple through 2007 \u2013 but Coryell switched the Chargers to their blue jerseys at home starting in [[1984 San Diego Chargers season|1984]]. With the exception of the [[1991 San Diego Chargers season|1991 season]] and other sporadic home games since, San Diego wears its blue jerseys at home.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}\n\nIn [[1985 San Diego Chargers season|1985]], the Chargers started using navy blue jerseys and returned to wearing white pants. The team's uniform design was next revamped in 1988. It featured an even darker shade of navy blue. The lightning bolts on the jerseys and helmets were white, with navy interior trim and gold outlining; the facemasks became navy blue. In [[1990 San Diego Chargers season|1990]], the team started to wear navy pants with their white jerseys. From [[1988 San Diego Chargers season|1988]] to [[1991 San Diego Chargers season|1991]], the team displayed stripes down the pants rather than lightning bolts. The Chargers went with all-white combinations in [[1997 San Diego Chargers season|1997]] and [[2001 San Diego Chargers season|2001]], only to have the blue pants make a comeback. On October 27, 2003, the Chargers wore their navy pants with their navy jersey for a ''Monday Night Football'' game versus the [[Miami Dolphins]] that was played at [[Sun Devil Stadium]], then the home of the [[Arizona Cardinals]], due to wildfires in southern California. This remains the only game in which the Chargers have worn the all-dark combination.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}|\n\nFrom the late 1980s to 2000, the Chargers wore white at home during some preseason games and dark for regular season games. In [[2001 San Diego Chargers season|2001]], the Chargers started wearing their dark uniforms for preseason games and white uniforms in September home games due to the heat before switching back to dark in October.\n\nIn March 2007, the Chargers unveiled their first uniform redesign since 1988, on the team's official website. The team formally unveiled this new uniform set, which mixes old and new styles, in a private team-only event. Navy blue remains the primary color on the home jersey, but the familiar lightning bolt was reverted to gold, and now has navy outlining and powder blue interior trim. The latter color is a nod to the 1960s uniforms. The redesigned lightning bolt was moved to the sides of the shoulders from the top, and includes a new numbering font and word mark in white, with gold outlining and powder blue interior trim. The pants also have a redesigned lightning bolt in gold, with powder blue trim on a navy stripe. Additionally, the team pays tribute to other uniform features from their history by wearing a metallic white helmet, with a navy face mask, the newly revamped bolt in gold with navy and powder blue trim, and white pants. The road white jerseys with navy pants, as well as the alternate powder blue jerseys with white pants, were also redesigned with the new scheme.<ref>{{cite news|title=Chargers Unveil New Uniforms|url=http://www.chargers.com/news/2007/03/14/chargers-unveil-new-uniforms|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=Chargers.com|date=March 14, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160811143337/https://www.chargers.com/news/2007/03/14/chargers-unveil-new-uniforms|archive-date=August 11, 2016|access-date=June 10, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nFrom [[2002 San Diego Chargers season|2002]] to [[2006 San Diego Chargers season|2006]], the Chargers used the early-1960s powder blue uniforms as alternate jerseys, which many football fans (both of the Chargers and of other teams) clamored for the team to bring back full-time.\n\nSince [[2007 San Diego Chargers season|2007]], the Chargers have worn the alternate powder blue jerseys twice per season.

There are few recognized guidelines in sports regarding retiring numbers, and the NFL has no specific league policy.  \"You have to have enough numbers for players to wear\", said NFL spokesman Greg Aiello.<ref name=\"sullivan_03042010\">{{cite news|last=Sullivan |first=Tim |title=Retiring a number can be tricky math problem |date=March 4, 2010 |newspaper=The San Diego Union Tribune |url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2010/mar/04/retiring-number-tricky-math-sullivan/?print&page=all |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20121209005200/http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2010/mar/04/retiring-number-tricky-math-sullivan/?print&page=all |archivedate=December 9, 2012 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> The Chargers have rarely retired numbers.<ref name=\"schofield\">{{cite news|last=Scholfield|first=Steve|title=Chargers to honor AFL icon Alworth|date=July 14, 2005|newspaper=North County Times|url=http://www.nctimes.com/sports/columnists/scholfield/article_f4af5516-4838-5fc0-b49e-5c50de637f2f.html|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130104014613/http://www.nctimes.com/sports/columnists/scholfield/article_f4af5516-4838-5fc0-b49e-5c50de637f2f.html|url-status=dead|archivedate=January 4, 2013}}</ref> The ''[[San Diego Union-Tribune]]'' wrote, \"The [Chargers] tend to honor their heritage haphazardly.\"<ref name=\"sullivan_08152006\">{{cite news|last=Sullivan|first=Tim|title=This time, icon finally receives proper sendoff|date=August 15, 2006|newspaper=The San Diego Union-Tribune|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060815/news_1s15sullivan.html|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130202061617/http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060815/news_1s15sullivan.html|url-status=dead|archivedate=February 2, 2013}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Los Angeles Chargers}};\"|'''Los Angeles Chargers retired numbers'''\n|-\n!

Packer replaced legendary P.A. announcer Bruce Binkowski, who went on to become the executive director of the Holiday and Poinsettia Bowl games, which are played at their former home, [[SDCCU Stadium]].\n\nWith the Chargers' return to Los Angeles in 2017, the team became a beneficiary of league scheduling policies. Both the Chargers and the [[Los Angeles Rams]] share the Los Angeles market, which is on the West Coast of the United States. This means that the Chargers cannot play home games, road division games against the [[Denver Broncos]] or [[Las Vegas Raiders]], or interconference road games against the [[NFC West]] (in seasons that the [[AFC West]] and NFC West meet in interconference play) in the early 10:00&nbsp;a.m. [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific time]] slot. In addition, they cannot play interconference home games at the same time or network as the Rams. As a result, both teams generally will have more limited scheduling options, and will also benefit by receiving more prime-time games than usual ([[National Football League on television#Chargers and Rams|click here]] for further information). Thus, regardless of the previous season's record, the Chargers will receive a disproportionate number of ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night]]'', ''[[Monday Night Football|Monday Night]]'' and/or ''[[Thursday Night Football|Thursday Night]]'' games, compared to the rest of the league. Additionally, if the Chargers and Rams are both playing at the same time on Sunday afternoons on a certain network (for instance, a Rams road game against an AFC opponent at the same time as a Charger home game with an NFC opponent with both on Fox, or the reverse where the Rams are on the road against an AFC opponent and the Chargers are at home against an AFC opponent on CBS), in the Los Angeles market, Fox and CBS have authorization to carry the extra game on their secondary sister stations; Fox games air on [[KCOP-TV]], while CBS games are aired on [[KCAL-TV]]. In 2020, the Chargers signed a multi-year preseason TV deal with [[KCBS-TV]] and [[KCAL-TV]] and will have a weekly show with the latest team news, replacing [[KABC-TV]] after three seasons (2017, 2018 and 2019) of televising Chargers preseason football. \n\n===Radio affiliates===\n[[File: San Diego Chargers radio affiliates.png|thumb|Map of radio affiliates]]\n[https://www.chargers.com/news/chargers-radio-network Chargers Radio Network]\n[http://www.chargers.com/news/2017/07/28/chargers-finalize-2017-broadcast-team-and-station-affiliates Chargers Finalize 2017 Broadcast Team and Station Affiliates]\n\n===English stations===\n\n====California====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Los Angeles Chargers|border=2}};\" | City !! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Los Angeles Chargers|border=2}};\" | Call Sign !! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Los Angeles Chargers|border=2}};\" | Frequency\n|-\n| rowspan=5|Los Angeles || [[KFI]] || 640 AM (Previous affiliate from 2017-2020)\n|-\n| [[KOST]] || 103.5 HD2 (HD radio simulcast of [[KFI]], Previous affiliate from 2017-2020)\n|-\n| [[KYSR]]/[[KSRY]] || 98.7/103.1 FM (Pre-Game [first two-hours], Full Game Coverage and 'Chargers Talk' Post-Game)\n|-\n| [[KYSR]] || 98.7 HD2 (HD radio simulcast of [[KLAC]], will carry select games)\n|-\n| [[KLAC]] || 570 AM (Secondary affiliate to [[KYSR]], will carry select games)\n|-\n| rowspan=2|[[San Diego]] || [[KGB-FM]] || 101.5 FM\n|-\n| [[KLSD]] || 1360 AM\n|-\n| [[Temecula, California|Temecula]]/[[Inland Empire]] || [[KATY-FM]] || 101.3 FM\n|-\n| [[Yucca Valley, California|Yucca Valley]] || [[KNWH]] || 1250 AM\n|-\n| [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]] || [[KNWZ]] || 94.3 FM\n|-\n| [[Palmdale, California|Palmdale]]/[[Lancaster, California|Lancaster]] || [[KAVL]] || 610 AM\n|-\n| [[Victorville, California|Victorville]]/[[Hesperia, California|Hesperia]] || [[KMPS (AM)|KMPS]] || 910 AM\n|-\n| [[Imperial Valley]] || [[KXO-FM]] || 107.5 FM \n|}\n\n====Nevada====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Los Angeles Chargers|border=2}};\" | City !! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Los Angeles Chargers|border=2}};\" | Call Sign !! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Los Angeles Chargers|border=2}};\" | Frequency\n|-\n| [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] || [[KKGK]] || 1340 AM\n|}\n\n===Spanish stations===\n\n====California====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Los Angeles Chargers|border=2}};\" | City !! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Los Angeles Chargers|border=2}};\" | Call Sign !! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Los Angeles Chargers|border=2}};\" | Frequency\n|-\n| Los Angeles/[[Orange County, California|Orange County]] || [[KFWB]] || 980 AM\n|-\n| [[San Diego]]/[[Tijuana|Tijuana, Mexico]] || [[XEXX-AM]] || 1420 AM\n|}\n\n====Mexico====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Los Angeles Chargers|border=2}};\" | City !! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Los Angeles Chargers|border=2}};\" | Call Sign !! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Los Angeles Chargers|border=2}};\" | Frequency\n|-\n|-\n| [[Mexicali, Mexico|Mexicali]] || [[XEHG-AM|XEHG]] || 1370 AM\n|-\n| [[Ensenada, Mexico|Ensenada]] || [[XHEPF-FM]] || 89.1 FM\n|}\n\n==Theme song==\n{{Main|San Diego Super Chargers}}\n\nThe Chargers' [[fight song]], \"[[San Diego Super Chargers]]\", was recorded in 1979 at the height of the team's success with [[Coryell offense|Air Coryell]], and has a distinctly [[disco]] sound.

It was written by [[Roland Orzabal]], [[Ian Stanley]], and [[Chris Hughes (musician)|Chris Hughes]] and produced by Hughes. The song was first released on 18 March 1985 by [[Phonogram Inc.|Phonogram]], [[Mercury Records|Mercury]], and [[Vertigo Records]] as the third single from the band's second album, ''[[Songs from the Big Chair]]'' (1985). \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" is a [[new wave music|new wave]] song. Its lyrics detail the desire humans have for control and power and centre on themes of [[corruption]].\n\nMusic critics praised \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" in their retrospective reviews, with some including the song in their respective decade lists. It is regarded as the group's [[signature song]], along with \"[[Shout (Tears for Fears song)|Shout]]\" (1984). It garnered success on charts internationally, peaking at number two in Ireland and the United Kingdom and at number one in Canada, New Zealand, and on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. It was certified gold by both [[Music Canada]] (MC) and the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI).\n\n[[Nigel Dick]] directed the music video, which received promotion from [[MTV]]. It shows bassist [[Curt Smith]] (who sings lead vocal) driving an antique [[Austin-Healey 3000]] sports car around [[Southern California]] intercut with shots of the band performing the song in a studio. In 1986, the song won \"[[Brit Award for British Single of the Year|Best Single]]\" at the [[Brit Awards]]. The group re-recorded the song as a charity single for the [[Sport Aid]] campaign. New Zealand singer [[Lorde]] recorded a cover of the song, which was included in the [[The Hunger Games: Catching Fire \u2013 Original Motion Picture Soundtrack|soundtrack]] for ''[[The Hunger Games: Catching Fire]]'' (2013).\n\n==Background and release==\n\"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" was written by [[Roland Orzabal]], [[Ian Stanley]] and [[Chris Hughes (musician)|Chris Hughes]], and produced by Hughes. The song was a \"last-minute\" addition during recording sessions of ''[[Songs from the Big Chair]]'' (1985). The decision to include the song in the album came after Orzabal played two chords on his acoustic guitar for Hughes.<ref name=\"Rosenberg\">{{cite web|first= Tal |last= Rosenberg |title= Tears for Fears: Songs from the Big Chair Album Review |website= [[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |date= 20 August 2017 |accessdate= 16 June 2018 |url= https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/tears-for-fears-songs-from-the-big-chair/}}</ref> It was recorded in two weeks and added as the final track on the album. According to Orzabal, he initially regarded the song as a lightweight that would not fit with the rest of the album.\n\nIn an interview with ''[[Mix (magazine)|Mix]]'' magazine, Hughes said that \"as a piece of recording history, [the song is] bland as hell.\" The lyrics of the song were originally \"everybody wants to go to war\", which Orzabal felt was lackluster.<ref>{{cite web|first= Tess |last= Vigeland |first2= Jacob |last2= Margolis |title= Tears for Fears reissue \"Songs from the Big Chair,\" 30 years on |website= Scpr.org |date= 26 November 2014 |accessdate= 22 March 2015 |url= http://www.scpr.org/programs/take-two/2014/11/26/40524/tears-for-fears-reissue-songs-from-the-big-chair-3/}}</ref> However, Hughes convinced Orzabal to record it, in a calculated effort to gain American chart success.

It was written by [[Roland Orzabal]], [[Ian Stanley]], and [[Chris Hughes (musician)|Chris Hughes]] and produced by Hughes. The song was first released on 18 March 1985 by [[Phonogram Inc.|Phonogram]], [[Mercury Records|Mercury]], and [[Vertigo Records]] as the third single from the band's second album, ''[[Songs from the Big Chair]]'' (1985). \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" is a [[new wave music|new wave]] song. Its lyrics detail the desire humans have for control and power and centre on themes of [[corruption]].\n\nMusic critics praised \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" in their retrospective reviews, with some including the song in their respective decade lists. It is regarded as the group's [[signature song]], along with \"[[Shout (Tears for Fears song)|Shout]]\" (1984). It garnered success on charts internationally, peaking at number two in Ireland and the United Kingdom and at number one in Canada, New Zealand, and on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. It was certified gold by both [[Music Canada]] (MC) and the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI).\n\n[[Nigel Dick]] directed the music video, which received promotion from [[MTV]]. It shows bassist [[Curt Smith]] (who sings lead vocal) driving an antique [[Austin-Healey 3000]] sports car around [[Southern California]] intercut with shots of the band performing the song in a studio. In 1986, the song won \"[[Brit Award for British Single of the Year|Best Single]]\" at the [[Brit Awards]]. The group re-recorded the song as a charity single for the [[Sport Aid]] campaign. New Zealand singer [[Lorde]] recorded a cover of the song, which was included in the [[The Hunger Games: Catching Fire \u2013 Original Motion Picture Soundtrack|soundtrack]] for ''[[The Hunger Games: Catching Fire]]'' (2013).\n\n==Background and release==\n\"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" was written by [[Roland Orzabal]], [[Ian Stanley]] and [[Chris Hughes (musician)|Chris Hughes]], and produced by Hughes. The song was a \"last-minute\" addition during recording sessions of ''[[Songs from the Big Chair]]'' (1985). The decision to include the song in the album came after Orzabal played two chords on his acoustic guitar for Hughes.<ref name=\"Rosenberg\">{{cite web|first= Tal |last= Rosenberg |title= Tears for Fears: Songs from the Big Chair Album Review |website= [[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |date= 20 August 2017 |accessdate= 16 June 2018 |url= https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/tears-for-fears-songs-from-the-big-chair/}}</ref> It was recorded in two weeks and added as the final track on the album. According to Orzabal, he initially regarded the song as a lightweight that would not fit with the rest of the album.\n\nIn an interview with ''[[Mix (magazine)|Mix]]'' magazine, Hughes said that \"as a piece of recording history, [the song is] bland as hell.\" The lyrics of the song were originally \"everybody wants to go to war\", which Orzabal felt was lackluster.<ref>{{cite web|first= Tess |last= Vigeland |first2= Jacob |last2= Margolis |title= Tears for Fears reissue \"Songs from the Big Chair,\" 30 years on |website= Scpr.org |date= 26 November 2014 |accessdate= 22 March 2015 |url= http://www.scpr.org/programs/take-two/2014/11/26/40524/tears-for-fears-reissue-songs-from-the-big-chair-3/}}</ref> However, Hughes convinced Orzabal to record it, in a calculated effort to gain American chart success. Orzabal acknowledged that the [[Swing (jazz performance style)#Swing as a rhythmic style|shuffle beat]] used in the song was \"alien\" to their way of writing music, stating it was \"jolly rather than square and rigid in the manner of '[[Shout (Tears for Fears song)|Shout]]', but it continued the process of becoming more extrovert.\" Curt Smith, the lead singer, said the themes were \"quite serious \u2013 it's about everybody wanting power, about warfare and the misery it causes.\"<ref>{{cite web|title= 1985 \u2013 Tears For Fears' 'Songs From The Big Chair' Hits #1 |website= RTTNews |accessdate= 22 June 2014 |url= http://www.rttnews.com/media/slideshow/slideshow.aspx?id=746}}</ref>\n\n\"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" was first released on 18 March 1985<ref name=\"flanders\"/> through [[Phonogram Records|Phonogram]], [[Mercury Records|Mercury]] and [[Vertigo Records]] as the third single from the band's second studio album, ''Songs from the Big Chair''.<ref>{{cite web|first= Michael |last= Pucci |title= Tears for Fears: Everybody Loves a Happy Ending |website= [[PopMatters]] |date= 29 November 2004 |accessdate= 10 July 2018 |url= https://www.popmatters.com/tearsforfears-everybody-2496092959.html}}</ref> The song was released for sale (as a [[LP record|7-inch]],<ref name=\"7inchvinyl\"/> [[LP record|10-inch]]<ref name=\"10inchvinyl\"/> and [[LP record|12-inch]]<ref name=\"12inchvinyl\"/> vinyl set) which included its B-side, interviews from the band and different versions of the song.<ref name=\"double7inchvinyl\"/> To accommodate the vinyl release, a CD video set was also distributed and included the song's music video along audios of bonus tracks.<ref name=\"cdvideouk\"/><ref name=\"cdvideous\"/>\n\n==Composition and lyrical interpretation==\n{{listen\n | filename    = Tears For Fears -

{"title_page": "US-1 Trucks", "text_new": "[[File:US1Introduction1981.jpg|thumb|1981 Tyco Catalog Introduction to US-1 Electric Trucking]]\n\n'''US-1 Electric Trucking''', produced by [[Tyco Toys]] from 1981 to 1986, is a line of [[HO scale]] slot car sets focused around trucks. It was similar to previous Tyco HO Scale racing sets; however the vehicles could be run in reverse due to having guide pins at the front and rear of the chassis. The line was unique because most of the vehicles were able to pick up and deliver loads from various \u2018Action Accessories\u2019 without intervention from the operator.\n\nOne of those involved in the development of US-1 was Derek A. Brand (1926 to 2012) who had designed the first HO slot system - [[mettoy|Playcraft]] Electric Highways, which was launched in 1959. He also laid down the geometric principles of HO slot car track systems that Tyco and many other manufacturers followed for many years. (The 9\" roadway straight was derived from Atlas HO model railroad 'Snap Track', to enable his model highways use with model railroad layouts).\n\nWhile only lasting six years, a number of sets were made, with one being based on the [[G.I. Joe]] franchise. Many trucks, trailers, and other vehicles were produced, such as dump trucks, a car hauler and a fire truck. It was marketed under the tagline of \"You Control The Action!\"\n\n== How it works ==\n[[File:Custom Track Layout.jpg|left|thumb|Basic, Custom Track Layout]]\n'''Electrical''': The system was originally designed to be operated from a 6v dc supply, this later increased to 9v dc. [[Transformer]]s were supplied with the sets, but the vehicles can be safely worked from most modern conventional model railroad transformer/controllers, if the original US-1 control gear is not used.\n\n'''Track''': The trucks run on a gray variant of the Tyco Quick Clik track that provides power to the vehicles through two thin metal strips in the track, which is similar to many other HO scale road and racing systems. The track was initially produced with yellow centre lines and some other markings, although this is less common and most track was supplied unmarked.\n\nTwo types of trailing turnouts were made that allowed the vehicles to pass through unimpeded and then, if required, reverse back into a siding to access an Action Accessory. These junctions consisted of a sprung copper tongue that extended across the slot, interacting with the front and rear guide pins. A switchable '''Hi Adventure''' junction was supplied in the GI Joe set, which would allow vehicles to travel in either direction without being automatically directed into a siding. Various combinations of track sections were supplied in the sets, except the 45 degree 12\" radius curves, which were only sold separately and are hard to find. Other rare track pieces include the 9\" double turnout that only appeared in two sets and the Railroad [[grade crossing]].\n\n'''Chassis''': Longitudinal copper pick-up shoes span almost the entire length of the chassis, which transfer the power to the [[Electric motor|motor]]. The pick-ups were held in by screws and could be replaced, although some later vehicles are known to have rivets instead of screws. The motor itself is a universal clip-in type that uses a worm screw to turn a [[worm wheel]] on the rear axle. These worms and gears were originally brown, but on most vehicles they are white.\n\nAt the front and back of the chassis, guide pins keep the truck on the track, allowing it to go in reverse. Guide pins were originally brown plastic blades mounted on a wedge-shaped base, but later and most commonly, round metal pins were used. On most chassis there are two raised angled strips molded on either side of the guide pin mount, which stopped the original plastic guide blades rotating. Comparatively few chassis are without these. The actual pin mounting never changed and either type of pin can be fitted to any vehicle.\n\nThe rear axle has removable [[Synthetic rubber|rubber]] [[tires]], that will get hard over time and consequently lose grip. These occasionally require replacing. However the front axle, the extra axle on the three six-wheeled vehicles, all the axles on the trailers (and even those on the dummy Firebird) had hard plastic tires which run freely and with hardly any drag. Only the higher Stomper chassis had rubber tires front and rear.\n\nEach vehicle carries two weights - a flat plate at the front and a block at the rear with a tunnel to clear the worm gear. The rear weights vary in size to suit the vehicle. On the [[Semi-trailer truck]] (or [[Tractor unit]]) the rear weight was black and [[Casting (metalworking)|cast]] in the  form of a [[Fifth-wheel coupling]] where the trailer was attached. These give the vehicle more traction and help it to pass through the sprung junctions, which can cause lighter (non US-1) vehicles to stall.\n\n'''Working Features''': The Wrecker and the Fire Truck both carried flashing lights, the latter carried a bell, too. These were [[Mechanism (engineering)|mechanically]] activated by a geared drive taken off the rear axle. Despite those features being added, the core chassis inside these two vehicles, were the same as all the others in the range except the Stompers, which used a bespoke deeper chassis [[Injection moulding|molding]] to accommodate the lower reach required by the pick ups, which was necessary because of the higher tires.\n\nOperation of the accessories is done automatically, usually by contact with the truck or trailer. However, in the case of the crane, bulldozer, and airport, the accessory is operated by the vehicle's drive wheels acting on a roller, (as it continues to be powered in reverse, whilst pushing against a stop block).\n\n'''Controllers''': Since this was a roadway system instead of a race track, the controllers were not hand-held, but were intended to resemble the [[dashboard]] of a truck. Originally separate and attached to the track via some wires, each controller had a [[steering wheel]] (to control the speed) and a switch mounted to the side (to control the direction).\n\nThe first type of controllers are known to exist both with and without the yellow lines on the road surface. The output from the transformer was plugged directly into the terminal rail attached to the two controllers.\n\nLater these individual units were simplified so the steering wheel did both speed and direction. By this time yellow markings had stopped being applied to the road surface.\n\nThe final type of controllers came as one twin unit in the form of a single box, attached to a molded base on the side of the track and these also only had a steering wheel. The transformer connection now plugged directly into the control box instead of the track. \n\nControllers are usually red but some of the final version were molded in green for the G.I. Joe and Stomper sets. The green ones only exist in this final twin version.\n\n== Vehicles & Trucks ==\n[[File:4 US-1 Trucks.jpg|thumb|2 Dump Trucks, a Semi Truck, & Fire Truck]]\nThe core chassis of all vehicles are of the same basic design throughout the range, (with only the Stompers using a different chassis molding) but there were many body types and different colors.\n\nThere were two makes of '''[[Semi-trailer truck|Semi-Tractor]]''' trucks modeled: One a [[Peterbilt]] conventional, the other a [[Kenworth]] C.O.E. ([[cab over engine]]). Both types had four wheels and were made to pull [[Semi-trailers]] in box, tank, flatbed, auto transporter and hopper varieties, using their exposed metal rear chassis weight which was also the Fifth Wheel Coupling.\n\nAll other vehicles except the wrecker and fire truck had plain rear chassis weights, which were hidden by the vehicle body.\n\nThere were three '''six-wheeled Peterbilt trucks''': [[dump truck]] (or tipper), troop carrier and a [[Vehicle recovery|Wrecker]]. On these, the extra axle was mounted under the body assembly.\n\n'''Other vehicles''' included a [[Mack Trucks|Mack]] [[Fire Truck]], [[police car]], [[Taxicab|taxi]], [[Pickup truck]], [[Dodge]] [[Panel van|delivery van]], [[ambulance]], [[Jeep]], and a [[Pontiac Firebird]] [[Coup\u00e9]] - The Firebird appeared in both powered (black color with gold eagle) and unpowered (white with black eagle) form, the latter for towing by the wrecker. The dummy car had a plastic chassis with a metal clip to help engage the jib of the wrecker.\n\n'''Body Colors''' were generally molded in pre-colored plastic, although the earliest known version of the Green and the Red Tipper, the Yellow/Orange and Red/White Strip Peterbilt Semi-tractors were molded in white plastic and given a painted finish. The same is true of the Mack Fire Truck, Airport Taxi, [[Goodyear Tires]] pick-up truck, Black Firebird and even the Police car, which was painted all over white before the blue panels, etc. were added. After-market re-sprays of models are becoming more common, too, they are sometimes offered for sale on Internet auction sites.\n\n'''Variations''': Over the years, a number of changes were made to the Peterbilt tipper mouldings. Following the release of the initial painted versions, production switched to pre-coloured plastic and a small ridge appeared lengthways in the middle of the rear of the dump bed, where the tailgate rested when shut. This ridge did not last long and was removed by the time the tail gate gained a bottom lug and matching receptor in the bucket to aid more secure closing. At the same time the originally round hinges became oval to allow the extra travel needed to open/close it.\n\nThe final change to the tipper bucket was when the tail gate changed to a fat 'T' shape, with 'stubs' added at the top on either side and the hinges were enlarged again and made thinner to accommodate these. This makes them rather fragile too. It is quite common to find these later hinges broken and the tailgate missing, whereas the earlier thicker hinges normally survive.\n\nFrom around 1983, Peterbilt Semis and Tippers both acquired an oval 'Peterbilt' logo on the sides of the hood and the front of the [[Radiator]]. The name \"Peterbilt\" can be clearly seen with a magnifier. Finally, when the tipper chassis was adapted with extra slots to take the troop-carrier body for the GI Joe set in 1984, the opening above the motor was changed from a square to a T shape.\n\nAs of April 2020, none of the plain Green Tippers or the common Semi-Tractors in either yellow and orange (with black stripes) or red (with white stripes)-(Unlighted version), have been found with the Peterbilt logos. Nor have any green Tippers been found with the troop carrier modifications to the base or with the final 'T' shaped tailgate and thinner hinges on the bucket. \n\nAs these trucks appeared in several sets that were available until the end of the range, this remains an interesting and so far unexplained anomaly. From the examples seen it would appear that the same is true for the less common red tipper, although this is thought to have only ever been included in one set. However, the red Semi-tractor with white stripes (lighted version), can be found both with and without the Peterbilt logos.\n\nAlthough the Stomper [[Blazer|Blazer]] enjoyed a very short life, variations are known: Test-shot moldings exist that include a clear plastic light bar, although no light bar has ever been found fitted on production models in this series, nor was any US-1 Blazer ever fitted with lights. The headlights on the body shell are just open round holes. Early bodies were supplied fitted with a pair of thin weights, secured sandwich-like, at the rear of the body, by two plastic prongs, melted over to hold them in place. Most examples found seem not to have these.\n\n'''Trailers''' The flat bed trailer comes in two distinct variations. The rear panel is either completely smooth or has a 6mm long ridge across the bottom. All the different color versions of the flat bed can be found both with and without this feature. \nThe ridge appears to have been added later as it also appears on a small number of hopper trailers. \n\nAll post US-1 Box trailers have this too. So far no tank trailers are known with this. See the section '''US-1 Body Shells - Before, After & Outside of US-1''' for information about the non US-1 versions of the Box trailer.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+List of Vehicles, Trucks, & Trailers\n!Trucks\n!Trailers\n!Vehicles\n|-\n|'''Peterbilt Truck Cab'''\n'''(Red with White Stripes)'''\n\n(No.3903 - 1981-1983)\n|'''Box Trailer''' \n'''(Bekins)'''\n\n(No. 3928 - 1981, 1982)\n|'''Stomper Blazer'''\n'''(White and Blue with Red Stripe)'''\n\n(No.3962 - 1985)\n|-\n|'''Peterbilt Truck Cab'''\n'''(Orange and Yellow with Black Stripes)'''\n\n(No.3904 - 1981-1982)\n|'''Gravel Trailer'''\n'''(Gravel Supply Company)'''\n\n(No. 3925 - 1981, 1982)\n|'''Stomper Blazer'''\n'''(Yellow/Gray/White with Orange Stripe)'''\n\n(No.3963 - 1985)\n|-\n|'''Peterbilt Truck Cab'''\n'''(Tan with Initials \"PB\" on Doors)'''\n\n(No.3908 - 1984-1985)\n|'''Gravel Trailer'''\n'''(Highway Construction Company)'''\n\n(No. 3926 - 1981-1984)\n|'''Stomper Pick-Up'''\n'''(Green and White with Black Stripes)'''\n\n(No.3965 - 1985)\n|-\n|'''Kenworth Truck Cab'''\n'''(Black with Yellow/Tan/Orange Stripes)'''\n\n(No.3909 - 1982-1985)\n|'''Box Trailer''' \n'''(Navajo)'''\n\n(No. 3930 - 1981, 1982)\n|'''Stomper Pick-Up'''\n'''(Yellow with Black and White Stripes)'''\n\n(No.3966 - 1985)\n|-\n|'''Kenworth Truck Cab'''\n'''(Blue with White/Yellow/Orange Stripes)'''\n\n(No.3910 - 1982)\n|'''Box Trailer'''\n'''(Pacific Intermountain Express)'''\n\n(No. 3927 - 1981, 1982)\n|'''Pick-Up Truck'''\n'''(Smith's Tire Orange and Black)'''\n\n(No.3951 - 1981-1982)\n|-\n|'''Peterbilt Truck Cab''' \n'''(Coastal Trucking Blue with Gold Stripes)'''\n\n(No.3913 - 1983-1985)\n|'''Box Trailer''' \n'''(Smith Transfer)'''\n\n(No. 3929 - 1981, 1982)\n|Dodge '''Van''' \n'''(Federal Express)'''\n\n(No.3952 - 1981-1982)\n|-\n|'''Kenworth Cab Over Truck Cab''' \n'''(Red/White/Orange)'''\n\n(No.3914 - 1983-1985)\n|'''Flatbed Trailer''' \n'''(Red Line)'''\n\n(No. 3931 - 1982)\n|Dodge Charger '''Police Car''' \n'''(Blue and White)'''\n\n(No.3953 - 1981-1984)\n|-\n|'''Lighted Peterbilt Truck Cab'''\n'''(Tan)'''\n\n(No. 3935 - 1984, 1985)\n|'''Flatbed Trailer''' \n'''(Roadway Express)'''\n\n(No. 3932 - 1982, 1983)\n|Dodge '''Ambulance'''\n(No.3954 - 1981-1984)\n|-\n|'''Lighted Peterbilt Truck Cab''' \n'''(Black with Gold Stripes)'''\n\n(No. 3939 - 1984, 1985)\n|'''Flatbed Trailer with 3 Crates''' \n'''(Roadway Express)'''\n\n(No. 3932 - 1984)\n|Dodge Charger '''Airport Taxi''' \n'''(Blue)'''\n\n(No.3955 - 1981-1982)\n|-\n|'''Peterbilt Dump Truck''' \n'''(Green)'''\n\n(No.3901 - 1981)\n|'''Tank Trailer''' \n'''(Shell)'''\n\n(No. 3940 - 1982-1984)\n|'''Pontiac Firebird''' \n'''(Black)'''\n\n(No.3956 - 1981-1984)\n|-\n|'''Peterbilt Dump Truck''' \n'''(Red)'''\n\n(No.3902 - 1981 and 1983)\n|'''Tank Trailer''' \n'''(Exxon)'''\n\n(No. 3941 - 1982-1984)\n|'''Army Jeep'''\n(No.3957 - 1983-1984)\n|-\n|'''Peterbilt Dump Truck'''\n'''(Red and Tan with Black Stripes)'''\n\n(No.3905 - 1984-1985)\n|'''Tank Trailer''' \n'''(Dupont)'''\n\n(No. 3942 - 1982)\n|'''Fire Truck''' \n'''(Lights, Bell, & Working Ladder)'''\n\n(No. 3911 - 1983-1985)\n|-\n|'''Peterbilt Dump Truck''' \n'''(Blue and Silver)'''\n\n(No.3912 - 1983-1985)\n|'''Tank Trailer''' \n'''(Borden's)'''\n\n(No. 3943 - 1982)\n|'''Peterbilt Wrecker with Disabled Car''' \n'''(Lighted Black Peterbilt with Shell logo; White Firebird)'''\n\n(No. 3918 - 1984, 1985)\n|-\n|'''Lighted Peterbilt Dump Truck''' \n'''(Red and Black)'''\n\n(No. 3937 - 1984, 1985)\n|'''Auto Transport with 4 Cars'''\n(No. 3946 - 1983, 1984)\n|'''G.I.

Some were based on designs which were originally part of the Tyco model railroad range. A full list appears later, but they are each worth describing in detail.\n\n'''Gravel''' \u2013 There was a small brown '''Gravel Unloading''' bin designed to sit under a length of single track that had a small oblong opening and a flat [[billboard]] at the end, where a green 'Gravel' sticker was applied. As the gravel trailer was reversed into this, a raised portion of the roadway engaged with and opened the shutter underneath the trailer, causing the gravel to fall through the opening and into the bin. This special track was later modified, gaining a box with raised sides around the opening, presumably to prevent spillages. Meanwhile, two long slots were also added on the sides to enable use with the '''Elevated Gravel Unloader''' (see below). The brown gravel bin was originally supplied with a tan-painted floor, discontinuing it was probably an early cost-cutting measure.\n\nTo fill the gravel trailer, there was an orange '''Operating Overhead Gravel Hopper''' that stood on a gantry over another type of single-road section (this was also used under the '''Barrel Loader'''). As the gravel trailer was reversed under the hopper it opened a shutter and was filled with gravel, ready to be driven away. This hopper was supplied with a small billboard type 'Gravel' sign that attached to the front of the hopper by two prongs. These are quite vulnerable and today are nearly always found broken. Adhesive putty can be used to mount billboards with broken prongs on the frame of the orange hopper. This is where it was often shown on the set box illustrations - (See Tyco Truck Resource link below).\n\nThe same hopper could be used as part of the '''Elevated Gravel Unloader''' which consisted of a set of '''Elevated Piers''' and a later version of the section of track supplied with the '''Gravel Unloading''' bin. This time that unloading track was intended to be positioned above the hopper, making it possible to fill your gravel trailer, drive around the circuit and then put that same gravel back in the same hopper ready to do it all again! The included instruction sheet shows a track diagram of how to arrange the track to achieve this and details where to position all six graduated height Elevated Piers.\n\nThe '''Gravel Supply Terminal''' was where a gravel trailer could park. Although there was no loading or unloading here, a neat little mechanism allowed the Semi-Tractor to reverse in and automatically hitch or un-hitch the trailer as required. There was a similar '''Freight Terminal''' where one of the Box Trailers could be parked, which worked in much the same way. Usually the gravel terminal mechanism has fewer moving parts than that in the freight terminal, but on early examples the mechanisms were identical.\n\nOriginal US-1 gravel was made of small plastic pellets and was supplied in a sealed clear plastic packet, but is often lost. [[Mung bean|Mung Beans]] look similar and make a perfect replacement.\n\n'''Crates''' \u2013 These are sturdy looking objects which were set out on a gray platform outside a cream shed. This was the '''Crate Loader'''. As the flat trailer was reversed in, it pushed the platform back into the shed and the crates went onto the trailer.\n\nThe '''Crate Unloader''' is a light gray platform at one side of a single track with a small yard on the other. Access was through a tall dark gray hoop from which a hinged flap is hanging. The ominous yellow and black hatchings and the words \u2018Unload Here\u2019 are a clue to what happens \u2013 the trailer loaded with crates is reversed under the flap, which hinges open away from the main road, allowing the trailer and crates to pass beneath, but as the trailer is withdrawn, the flap locks vertical and rigid, then brutally tears the crates from the trailer onto the floor, irrespective of any \u2018Fragile\u2019, \u2018Handle With Care\u2019 or \u2018This Way Up\u2019 stickers that might be applied to them.\n\nIn the Army Transport set this Action Accessory became an '''Ammunition Dump''' with different stickers and the crates were a darker brown. Replica crates have been produced but were not widely available. If originals or replicas are unavailable, a 1\" Wooden Cube suffices. \n\n'''Car Loader''' \u2013 Similar in principle to the crate loader, a double-deck red hollow \u2018cartridge\u2019 is loaded up with the four brightly colored automobiles \u2013 two on each level. The yellow [[Car carrier trailer|car trailer]] reverses against the cartridge, moving it back against a tall red stop block. This causes the four cars to roll forward and fill the two decks of the trailer. The '''Car Unloader''' is a long roadway with an orange gantry leading to two ramps. As the Auto Transporter trailer reverses in, it engages with the gantry, causing the decks to rise up at the cab end, encouraging the cars to roll out of the trailer, onto the ramps and finally come to a rest, spread out on the black cardboard [[Parking Lot]] that is part of this item.\n\n'''Logs''' - These were brown-stained 9mm-diameter wood [[dowel]]s 1.5\u201d long and could be loaded into the dump truck by the '''Log Loader/Elevated Log Loader''', which held the loading device high on an orange girder gantry. It is designed to sit under a high-level roadway, so the loading rig is alongside. The actual loading part consisted of a sloping tray in which the logs are laid. This has a lever that is activated by the tipper truck reversing alongside. This released some of the logs into the truck. The loading portion could be removed from the girder base and clipped alongside track at ground level if desired. The actuating lever is quite fragile and many found today are broken. The lever tends to strike most larger passing vehicles when the loader is clipped in place.\n\n'''Operating Log-Loading Bulldozer''' - is a mechanical accessory of the type for which Tyco were famous. The bulldozer is activated by the motor of the truck that is being loaded. This is [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmitted]] to the mechanism by rollers. Once the truck was reversed in, it rested against a stop block. The power is kept on, causing the [[bulldozer]] to push the logs up a gentle slope and into the body of the truck. There is a driver wearing a blue uniform who sat in the controls of the bulldozer. He is prone to breakage or being lost, as are the exhaust pipes. Once the logs have been loaded and the truck has left, the bulldozer needs resetting by hand and the stock of logs, replenishing. Logs are often missing but dowelling of a suitable thickness (8mm-diameter adequately substitutes the original 9mm size) can be cut to length and stained in a commercial wood stain, or even tea or coffee, to look much the same as the originals.\n\n'''Boulders''' - There is an identical '''Boulder Loading Bulldozer''' which came with some boulders (these are actual small stones not imitations) instead of logs. This is much less common than the log-loading version and seems to have been introduced later. Today suitable replacement stones can be obtained from hobby stores. Tumbled and glazed ones reduce friction and avoid scuffing the surface of the accessory.\n\n'''Pipes''' - The '''Operating Crane Pipe Loader''' was another mechanically activated accessory borrowed from Tyco model railroads. The drive was the same as the bulldozer but activated a crane with a rigid wire hook in the shape of an 'L' to move in a back and forth, up and down movement. As it moved, it scooped up a pipe and deposited it in the rear of the waiting truck which supplied the power. It continued in the same movement while the power was applied. The pipes were 14mm-diameter wide white plastic tubular moulding, in 10mm lengths. These were held on edge in a narrow sloping trough, molded into the base, presenting their open side ready for the crane to engage. As one was taken, the next rolled into place ready for the crane to swing back. The crane did not need any manual intervention, other than more pipes being added when they ran out. Pipes, like logs and gravel are often missing but 15mm-diameter plastic water pipe cut into 10mm lengths makes a perfect substitute.\n\n'''Barrels''' - These are 13mm-diameter, 19mm long and have one end sealed. They are usually molded in off white plastic, but were dark butter yellow in the Army Transport set and white in the Stomper Set. The same barrel-molding was used as a load for a brown slat-sided semi-trailer in the TYCO TCR series, although in a luminous yellow plastic.\n\nThese were held in the '''Barrel Loader''' - a brown sloping rack mounted on a yellow girder frame. As the tipper truck reversed, it engaged with a lever that released some barrels, which rolled from the rack into the truck. A version with a blue sloping rack and the same yellow frame was shown in publicity material and on the carton of the Motor City set. All examples found have the same brown loader as all the others, but with '''Motor City Oil Co.''' stickers with blue writing on a white background. As yet, no substitute barrels have been found, but a 19mm-long, suitable-diameter pipe or dowel would probably suffice.\n\n'''Unloading Yards''' - There were two varieties, the more common '''Pipe and Log Unloading Yard''', which had a grey base and brown walls. This was sold separately, as well as being in most in most sets, and also appeared with blue walls in the 3209 Motor City Set. The blue unloading yard is labeled with Goodyear stickers and according to catalog illustrations was intended to receive tires, although a way of loading them was not devised. In the Army Transport Set, the standard brown-walled Unloading Yard became an '''Army Dump''' with different stickers.\n\nThe second smaller Unloading Yard arrived later and is much harder to find. It is on a 9\" 45 degree double turnout supplied in the 3213 Highways Wrecker Set and 3219 Night Haulers Set. Originally this track was just a double turnout, but a small unloading yard with brown walls was added on one side of the junction and most of these sections that are found have this.\n\nThe Unloading Yards worked by the lip at the entrance of the yard engaging with the 'steps' or 'mud flaps' on the rear of the reversing tipper's bucket. This causes it to rise, the tailgate to open and the goods to slide out into the yard. Logs, pipes, barrels, tires and presumably boulders could all be deposited in the unloading yards but not gravel, simply because the rear of the tipper was too large to go under the hopper.\n\n'''Airport''' - This mechanical accessory lacks any loading or unloading function. The rollers transmit the drive from the vehicle to the orange [[radar]] dish on a white cap, which rotates atop the terminal building. Attached to the inside of the cap is a long, rigid wire. On the far end of this is a small plastic plane. As the radar revolves in an [[Clockwise|anti-clockwise]] direction, the plane circulates the tower, soaring up and coming back down, over and over again, almost landing and then taking off. There is a cardboard mat supplied for the building to stand on which includes a short section of [[Runway|runway]].\n\nThis is popular at shows, causing gasps and wows as the plane appears to fly. There are two planes provided and they are both rather small for the scale of the trucks and the buildings. One of them is in [[FedEx]] livery, so a good vehicle to use with this would be the FedEx delivery van or the Airport Taxi, whilst the Semi-Tractor shown on the box looks rather out of place.\n\nThe radar dish is fragile and often broken or missing. The walls are blue and the windows lined in white with the word 'Airport' on the blue roof in big white letters. This was mainly sold as a separate item but appeared in one set (in this form), the 3225 Coast to Coast Set.\n\nThe Airport appeared again with brown walls and a gray roof, as the '''Forest Rescue''' centre in the very rare 3211 Stomper Set. This time the radar and cap were moulded in butter yellow and the plane has simpler decoration to allow for the application of the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] stickers and Forest Rescue markings.\n\n'''G. I. Joe Satellite Launcher''' - This consisted of a two-piece sculpted concrete effect [[launch pad]] area with a straight approach track at the centre of one side. The base unit for the pad was clearly derived from the 3440 Unloading Yard.\n\nThe pivoting launching [[Gantry (rocketry)|gantry]] folds down horizontally, in line with the roadway, in order to engage with a [[missile]] loaded on a flatbed trailer as it is reversed towards it. In this position the launch gantry engages with the hollow missile and as the trailer backs further the gantry pivots to bring the missile to the upright position.\n\nMissiles are normally white with a gray cap but a few rare examples are known to have red caps. The gantry is a very delicate white plastic molding and many found today have broken pivot arms. This accessory was exclusive to the GI Joe set and was never available separately.\n\n'''Garage Type Buildings''' - This basic structure appeared in different colours, with different signs to serve as three differently purposed buildings, all with road access:\n\n1/ '''Highway Wrecker Set with Lighted Wrecker, Tow Car & Garage''' - The building was yellow with an orange roof and petrol pump. There also a special piece of single straight track with switch that allowed the towed car, the White Firebird, to be unhitched as it was reversed in to the opening.\n\n2/ '''Fire Station with Switch Track & Storage Yard''' - was a red version of the building with a black roof. This came off a different track section that formed a tuning-fork shape. The Fire station stood over the right lane, whilst the left lane was open. As a vehicle drove in to one lane, the turnout automatically switched to the other, isolating the first vehicle. There was a representation of a [[Siren (alarm)|siren]] on the roof of this building, which looks a bit like chimney.\n\n3/ '''Garage with Switch Track & Truck Stop''' - This was similar to the fire station, but had white walls, a blue roof, red windows, etc. It had the same track section as the fire station and operated in the same way. There was no siren or petrol pump.\n\n'''Flashing Danger Track''' - came with a '''15\" Straight Squeeze Track''' where one lane moved towards the other to avoid a hazard. This made it impossible for two vehicles to pass simultaneously. There is a red beacon with a flashing yellow light that sits at the side of the road warning oncoming vehicles. This accessory needed two AA batteries.\n\n'''3673 Overhead Interstate Highway Signs''' were sold in packs. These contained six gray over-road lattice gantries that each had two blank sign panels and sheets of different stickers to apply to them. They were also supplied in every US-1 set, including the Stomper Set with some special labels, including one for a Stomper Garage.\n\nMost of the stickers provided relate to the various action stations: Log Loader 3 Miles Ahead, Dump Site, Motor City Car Lot, Freight Terminal, Gravel Terminal, Gravel Hopper, Oil Refinery, etc. (There was never an Oil Refinery Action Station). The stickers have a tendency to dry out and fall off over time and the gantries themselves are delicate and prone to breakage, deformation and yellowing.\n\nThe earlier gantries have a clearance height of 60mm from the ground and have 35mm long flat feet on either side intended to be tucked under the track. These are not very effective at standing up and are too low for the loaded car transporter to pass beneath.\n\nThe later type of gantries have a 70mm clearance from the ground and the feet are only 25mm long, but each has a wedge shape projecting against the side of the track. The newer design clips positively against the track and usually remains there.\n\nIn place, the gantries are scenic, but tend to obstruct the cleaning of contact rails or attending to a vehicle.\n\n'''3768 Overhead Highway Light''' is a neat little gray streetlamp, set on a huge base that housed an AA battery and was operated by a switch. The bulb is a Grain of Wheat type mounted in the head with a reflector behind. These are surprisingly effective when they work, but they often don't, due to failed bulbs, broken switches and corrosion from leaky batteries.\n\nAlthough never sold separately, the light gray '''US-1 Elevated Piers''' appeared in four of the trucking sets and were a key part of the '''3453 Elevated Gravel Unloader'''. A set of piers included two of each. Pier 1 is 19mm high, number 2 is 38mm and pier 3 reached a height of 57mm. In the top of each pier was a 11mm-diameter round hole that engaged with the corresponding round lugs on the underside of most lengths of US-1 Track.\n\nBesides the piers, elevated items in the US-1 series included the '''Elevated Gravel Unloader''' which required the track to be at 73mm from the base and the '''Elevated Log Loader''' which needed it to be at 76mm high. The US-1 piers are the same as those sold to use with Tyco Quick Clik racing track although these were often cream instead of light gray. The shape of the pillars (a gently tapered series of progressively smaller concentric oblongs), goes back to the Tyco Pro series of track, although the top fixings of those were not compatible with US-1 or Quick Clik.\n\n'''Working Height:''' Although sold for potential use with an HO-scale model railroad, the US-1 elevated track has a clearance of 57mm provided by the high level piers, which is insufficient to clear a train running below. This is made worse if a 'roadbed' type model railroad track is used, where the track sits on some imitation ballast, raising the height of the rails by several mm.\n\n57mm is also too low to allow a loaded car transporter pass underneath. However, as the elevated piers are hollow, it is possible to stack them upon each other, to give the extra height required, provided enough can be found.\n\nIt is still possible to get packs of brand new unused (old stock) Tyco piers from at least one supplier on the Internet. One layout that can be seen on a video app has a high level circuit supported by 87mm high pillars which have been created from 3 of the middle rise piers firmly stacked together. This height is enough to clear an HO Railroad on a roadbed type track, as well as any US-1 road circuit running a loaded car transporter.\n\nThere were also three [[Plastic model|Plastic Construction Kits]]: a '''[[Mobil Oil|Mobil Truck Station]]''', a '''[[Howard Johnson's|Howard Johnson's Truck Stop]]''', and a '''P.I.E. Freight Terminal''', each molded in several colors to be glued together. These were supplied by Pola, in what was then [[West Germany]] and were also sold for a time as part of the Tyco model railroad range, but in plain Tyco 'Brown Box' packaging and with slightly different names and in some cases different colourings or markings. The Truck station and Freight Terminal kits have appeared in other ranges over the years and are still available, but now as part of the [[Wm. K. Walthers|Walther's]] Trainline range and with different colourings and markings.\n\n=== Sets ===\nMost US-1 pieces came together in a series of sets, based on certain duties a truck would need to do. Numerous sets came out between 1981 and 1986, each with varied action accessories as described above. Some sets were themed, such as the 3235 Road & Rail set, with a complete railroad and two of the 3727 grade crossings, or the 3217 G.I. Joe High Adventure Set, based around soldiers and their equipment.\n\nThe vehicles supplied in the sets were however only a small selection of those available: The Peterbilt tipper appeared in most sets (except the G.I. Joe, Highway Wrecker and Stomper Sets) - Usually in the standard lime green, but was olive green especially for the army transport set and is believed to have been red in the rare Empire Set\n\nThe Peterbilt Semi-tractor was also included in most sets, (except Army Transport, Fire Alert and Stomper sets) the colors being red with white stripes or yellow with orange and black stripes (both are consequently common colors for this vehicle). It was in Army Green in the GI Joe set.\n\nThe Kenworth Semi-tractor was only sold in two sets - appearing in blue with stripes in the Fire Alert set, whilst the olive version was exclusive to the Army Transport set. In the Night Haulers set the Green tipper and the Red Peterbilt semi-tractor were both lighted versions\n\nOther vehicles featuring in sets are the Fire Truck, Wrecker, Dummy Firebird, Stomper Blazer, Stomper Pick Up and the Cobra Troop carrier which was only available in the G.I. Joe set\n\nThe G.I. Joe set also came with soldiers, tanks, jeeps, a helicopter, a boat, a bridge, paratroopers, a die-cut Secret Cobra Command Headquarters, a full-color G.I. Joe Action Battle Mat (with Mountain Backdrop) and a unique '''Satellite Launching Pad with Gantry''' Action Accessory.\n\nArguably, one of the rarest and most expensive sets has a [[Schaper Toys|Schaper]] Stompers theme. Only produced in 1985, complete examples are very rare. It contains a special version of the Airport in brown (3434), unique this set. A die-cut cardboard building can be folded to make a garage for the cars. The set sits on a Stompers-themed playmat, with a portion of the track supported by Elevated Piers.\n\nAnother rare set is the 3213 Highway Wrecker Set, released in 1984. This set contains a gravel loader, gravel unloader, garage, double turnout, special straight with [[Telephone booth|phone booth]], billboard sign.

This is usually because most sections of US-1 track were just a gray variant of the Quick Clik black racing track. Some items can be found with a racing and US-1 reference underneath - the Squeeze track and the Lane changer for example, but even then the number molded is usually a part number rather than a catalogue number. For example the bespoke 9\" Junction carries the reference 3016 beneath but was listed as 3700. Most separate track appears to have been sold in pairs in carded blister packs except the 9\" junction and the railroad crossing which were individually sold in blister packs and the squeeze track which was sold with the flashing beacon in an illustrated box.\n\nWe have listed the special and rare 'set only' items of track in the table above by their molded numbers, to help identify them.\n\nThere were several different '''Assortment Packs''' advertised in the annual catalogs. These contained substantial quantities of track, and other items such as Street Lamps or Overhead Signs. The contents and reference numbers changed over time, but the packs always appeared to contain three transformers and three controllers, which seems rather odd. It is not known how these were packaged and they were never shown on retail price lists, so they may well have been aimed at dealers.\n\nBoulder Loading Bulldozer*  - Two reference numbers have come to light for this item: 3414 is shown on literature enclosed with the accessory, whilst 3470 appears in the 1984 and 1985 Tyco catalogs. Both are shown above. Anyone with access to a box for this please feel free to update!\n\n==US-1 Body Shells - Before, After & Outside of US-1 ==\nThe Peterbilt Semi-Tractor had preceded the US-1 range, being introduced in 1979 on the lighted HP2 racing chassis and a slotless, lighted Command Control chassis. The latter was black with flames and no hole in the fifth wheel - or sometimes a hole, which was too small for the later trailers.\n\nCommand Control was Tyco\u2019s first attempt at slotless racing and a direct competitor to the original [[Ideal Toy Company|Ideal]] [[Total Control Racing]] or TCR. The same body was later used again in the Tyco version of the Slotless TCR system produced from 1991 to 1993\n\nBoth the Peterbilt and Kenworth Semi-tractor moldings were used in racing form, with a chromed plastic fifth wheel, which was initially attached by a rivet and two melted-over plastic side pegs to the platform behind the driver\u2019s cab. On later Peterbilts the rivet was deleted and the side pegs were considered enough, although the rivet hole remained. \n\nTwo versions of the Kenworth 'Cab over' Semis were available in racing form between 1983 and 1985 with HP7 chassis. One is mainly black with a red stripe that has white edges and the other mainly white with blue patches and orange stripes. \n\nMost of the racing and Slotless Semi-tractor bodies can be easily adapted to fit a US-1 chassis by drilling out the hollow rivet and pegs that hold the chromed plastic fifth wheel in place. Any vehicle so modified will have three evenly spaced tell-tale holes visible on the platform just behind the cab. On some early examples of the Peterbilt Semi-Tractor this rear platform is lower and consequently these bodies will not fit a US-1 chassis without further work.\n\nThe Peterbilt Semi bodies that won't fit on a US-1 chassis can be identified by their colors: Baby Blue with Black Stripes or White with Red Stripes. Also some in Yellow with fine Orange and Red Stripes or Black with Flames used the original version of the body as well as the later version that will fit. Some of these had gray grills and exhausts instead of Chrome.\n\nOf the many US-1 trailers, only the box type made it into the racing series, appearing in various color schemes. The later had a redesigned reversible bogie with a slot-guide plus a bar magnet to encourage it to stay on the track, although some are known to carry the US-1-type bogie. At the front end, these box trailers kept their US-1 style pivot, allowing them to be run with US-1 Semi-Tractors.\n\nThe Dodge Van can be found in various liveries in racing form and also in Tyco TCR form as the Blue and White \u2018Emergency\u2019 Jam Car. This featured the red light-bar that had been used on the US-1 Mack Fire Truck.\n\nPolice Cars: There is a US-1 publicity photo showing a four-door [[Plymouth Satellite]] in use as the US-1 Police Car: with roof lights, a large hood mounted blower and side pipes, but this was never released as part of the US-1 range. (See the Tyco Resource in the '''External Links''' section Below - Vehicles page)\n\nThe US-1 \u2018911\u2019 police car and Airport Taxi were based on the two-door [[Dodge Charger]] that had been introduced to the Tyco range back in 1977. This was done without \u2018door-netting\u2019 on the glazing and the body was modified to take the roof lights for the police car. The Charger remained in the Tyco racing range until 2005.\n\nOther US-1 vehicles that can be found with a racing chassis are the Jeep in civilian colors which was available from 1980 to 1983 and the Black and Gold Firebird which was sold from 1979 to 1983 but was to eventually reappear in 2005 and 2006 in two special sets.\n\nThere are eight non-US-1 versions of the Stomper Blazer, five of which were equipped with lights, that the US-1 version never carried. One was sold as part of the Faller AMS series. The three 'flame paint' versions had no lights\n\nThe Mack Fire Truck was also sold as part of the Faller AMS range, both individually (cat no. 5631) and in the 'Feuer Alarm' set (Cat no. 3907), which also contained a lighted blue and white racing version of the Pontiac Firebird. These were both introduced in 1983 and the truck was catalogued for at least two years. From two examples seen, it would appear to be the standard US-1 offering, with the same chassis, mechanical bell, lights and American markings. Even the molded 'Tyco H.K.'markings were underneath.\n\nUnusually, at this late stage, Faller AMS had extensive links to Aurora AFX. The Fire Truck appeared in the Faller range alongside some of the same Semi-Tractors and trailers which were also sold as part of the Aurora 'Big Ryder' series, (which was their answer to Tyco US-1), as well as other Tyco offerings.\n\n== Spare Parts, Running and Collecting ==\n'''Spare parts:''' Some parts, such as pick-ups, were originally available from the manufacturers, but today these are hard to find. Luckily a number of people have begun producing parts to keep US-1 vehicles running. Tires which fit all the standard vehicles are available from a number of vendors. Specially stamped and shaped replacement pick-ups can be obtained too, which fit all the vehicles in the series, (including the Stompers). Recently, batches of light bars for the wrecker and fire engine have been made, along with the unique tires for the Stomper and some US-1-type metal guide pins. Their availability can be seen on the Internet.\n\n'''Motor''': The motor used throughout US-1 was a standard [[Mabuchi Motor|Mabuchi]] item and can also be found fitted to other vehicles, including 'Ideal' Slot Cars, later some slotless Tyco TCR 'Jam Cars'. [[New old stock]] spares can sometimes be found and many similar, but not identical motors were made. When checking a Mabuchi motor to see if it will be a suitable replacement, the available length of the shaft to take the worm gear and the position of the contacts (which is on the side of US-1 motors) need to be considered.\n\n'''Customised items and Replicas:''' One vendor specialises in making double 90 degree turnouts out of two single ones, along with 9\" and 6\" single straights. All very handy when maximising layout space. Vendors offering trucks, trailers, loads and Action Accessories in custom finishes, such as FedEx, can often be found on a well known Internet auction site\n\n'''Running suggestions:''' To run US-1 (and not use the original control gear), wires can be carefully soldered to the underside of the two contact strips, but given the age and condition of the track, it is recommended that as the layout size increases, the number of 'feeds' to each circuit are increased to avoid voltage drop. US-1 track has not always aged well and much found will have discolored or had minor bits broken off at the joints. To obtain the best running results, use the best track available and clean it well: Wash and scrub with a good detergent and then dry it thoroughly. Give the contact strips a rub with an abrasive track-cleaning block, (like those used for model railroads) and pay particular attention to the areas where the metal contact strips join. Treatment of the metal strips with a non-damaging contact oil can be helpful, but try to avoid getting any on the road surface.\n\n'''Integration with Other Makes:''' US-1 vehicles will run on most other makes of HO slot car track, but the Action Accessories can only be connected to Tyco US-1 track via the special US-1 turnouts. US-1 track is a gray version of Tyco Quick Clik and this is compatible with the later Mattel track.  Adaptor sections to join Quick Clik to the older Tyco Pro and Life-Like Racing tracks have been made, but only the [[Round 2 (company)|Auto World]] 'Tyco Quick Clik to Tomy AFX' type appears to still be in production.\n\nVehicles from this range are relatively wide, so if two trucks are simultaneously run on an earlier, narrower slot-car track, like Playcraft Highways or [[Aurora Plastics Corporation|Aurora Model Motoring]], they will collide.\n\nNon US-1 vehicles can be run on Trucking layouts, but lighter types like Aurora [[Pancake (slot car)|TJets]] will get 'beached' on the sprung copper tongues at the junctions, wheras Magnetic slot cars will generally cope quite well as they usually have enough 'virtual' weight to pass through them.\n\n'''Control Gear:''' In the experience of this contributor, (from running various makes of model electric roadways for around 35 years), the best type of controller to use is a Model Railroad 'feedback' type. These give good speed control and steady constant speed running, (resistance types of many makes have been tried but can cause erratic running). Videos exist showing the trucks being successfully run with Model Railroad [[Digital Command Control]] 'electronic chips' fitted. This is not for the faint-hearted and can also be expensive.\n\n'''Servicing:''' Any vehicle obtained will need a good clean, and the tunnel weight temporarily removed by prising the side with a small flat screwdriver. This allows removal of fluff, which accumulates around the worm screw and rear axle. Lightly oil the motor bearings, axles and gears, replace the tires if they are hardened and the pick ups, too, if they are 'rutted'.\n\n'''Fitting Replacement Pick Ups:''' Do not pre-bend them, the cast plate that holds them into the chassis will automatically set them to correct angle as they are screwed into place. (Pre-bending them can exert to much force on the roadway, resulting in lost traction). However it is important to ensure that the folded 'retaining brackets' at the ends of the strips are free to travel up and down in their open mountings. On the Semi-Tractors ensure that the 'return' portion of these brackets does not rub against the Fifth Wheel weight, or it will stop it moving freely and may cause a short circuit.\n\n'''Videos:''' Although today models and sets are bought by collectors, many US-1 trucks are operated either at home or at public shows. Videos showing this can be found on some video apps. Some of the films show the various loading and unloading accessories in action and original commercials for the range can be found, too: Search for 'Tyco Trucking' or 'Tyco US-1'.\n\n==External links==\nUS-1 Trucking Resource [http://tycotrain.tripod.com/tycous1trucking/]\n\nDerek A Brand - Tribute Page = [http://www.daveshobby.net/derek-brand-tribute.html]\n\nHistory of HO Slot Car racing [http://www.hoslotcarracing.com/History.html]\n\nTyco Catalogs (Year by year, page by page) [https://www.hoseeker.org/tyco.htm]\n\n==See also==\n* [[U.S. 1 (comics)]], a [[Marvel Comics]] series licensed from this toyline, set in the [[Marvel Universe]].\n\n[[Category:Toy cars and trucks]]\n\n\n{{Toy-stub}}\n", "text_old": "[[File:US1Introduction1981.jpg|thumb|1981 Tyco Catalog Introduction to US-1 Electric Trucking]]\n\n'''US-1 Electric Trucking''', produced by [[Tyco Toys]] from 1981 to 1986, is a line of [[HO scale]] slot car sets focused around trucks. It was similar to previous Tyco HO Scale racing sets; however the vehicles could be run in reverse due to having guide pins at the front and rear of the chassis. The line was unique because most of the vehicles were able to pick up and deliver loads from various \u2018Action Accessories\u2019 without intervention from the operator.\n\nOne of those involved in the development of US-1 was Derek A. Brand (1926 to 2012) who had designed the first HO slot system - [[mettoy|Playcraft]] Electric Highways, which was launched in 1959. He also laid down the geometric principles of HO slot car track systems that Tyco and many other manufacturers followed for many years. (The 9\" roadway straight was derived from Atlas HO model railroad 'Snap Track', to enable his model highways use with model railroad layouts).\n\nWhile only lasting six years, a number of sets were made, with one being based on the [[G.I. Joe]] franchise. Many trucks, trailers, and other vehicles were produced, such as dump trucks, a car hauler and a fire truck. It was marketed under the tagline of \"You Control The Action!\"\n\n== How it works ==\n[[File:Custom Track Layout.jpg|left|thumb|Basic, Custom Track Layout]]\n'''Electrical''': The system was originally designed to be operated from a 6v dc supply, this later increased to 9v dc. [[Transformer]]s were supplied with the sets, but the vehicles can be safely worked from most modern conventional model railroad transformer/controllers, if the original US-1 control gear is not used.\n\n'''Track''': The trucks run on a gray variant of the Tyco Quick Clik track that provides power to the vehicles through two thin metal strips in the track, which is similar to many other HO scale road and racing systems. The track was initially produced with yellow centre lines and some other markings, although this is less common and most track was supplied unmarked.\n\nTwo types of trailing turnouts were made that allowed the vehicles to pass through unimpeded and then, if required, reverse back into a siding to access an Action Accessory. These junctions consisted of a sprung copper tongue that extended across the slot, interacting with the front and rear guide pins. A switchable '''Hi Adventure''' junction was supplied in the GI Joe set, which would allow vehicles to travel in either direction without being automatically directed into a siding. Various combinations of track sections were supplied in the sets, except the 45 degree 12\" radius curves, which were only sold separately and are hard to find. Other rare track pieces include the 9\" double turnout that only appeared in two sets and the Railroad [[grade crossing]].\n\n'''Chassis''': Longitudinal copper pick-up shoes span almost the entire length of the chassis, which transfer the power to the [[Electric motor|motor]]. The pick-ups were held in by screws and could be replaced, although some later vehicles are known to have rivets instead of screws. The motor itself is a universal clip-in type that uses a worm screw to turn a [[worm wheel]] on the rear axle. These worms and gears were originally brown, but on most vehicles they are white.\n\nAt the front and back of the chassis, guide pins keep the truck on the track, allowing it to go in reverse. Guide pins were originally brown plastic blades mounted on a wedge-shaped base, but later and most commonly, round metal pins were used. On most chassis there are two raised angled strips molded on either side of the guide pin mount, which stopped the original plastic guide blades rotating. Comparatively few chassis are without these. The actual pin mounting never changed and either type of pin can be fitted to any vehicle.\n\nThe rear axle has removable [[Synthetic rubber|rubber]] [[tires]], that will get hard over time and consequently lose grip. These occasionally require replacing. However the front axle, the extra axle on the three six-wheeled vehicles, all the axles on the trailers (and even those on the dummy Firebird) had hard plastic tires which run freely and with hardly any drag. Only the higher Stomper chassis had rubber tires front and rear.\n\nEach vehicle carries two weights - a flat plate at the front and a block at the rear with a tunnel to clear the worm gear. The rear weights vary in size to suit the vehicle. On the [[Semi-trailer truck]] (or [[Tractor unit]]) the rear weight was black and [[Casting (metalworking)|cast]] in the  form of a [[Fifth-wheel coupling]] where the trailer was attached. These give the vehicle more traction and help it to pass through the sprung junctions, which can cause lighter (non US-1) vehicles to stall.\n\n'''Working Features''': The Wrecker and the Fire Truck both carried flashing lights, the latter carried a bell, too. These were [[Mechanism (engineering)|mechanically]] activated by a geared drive taken off the rear axle. Despite those features being added, the core chassis inside these two vehicles, were the same as all the others in the range except the Stompers, which used a bespoke deeper chassis [[Injection moulding|molding]] to accommodate the lower reach required by the pick ups, which was necessary because of the higher tires.\n\nOperation of the accessories is done automatically, usually by contact with the truck or trailer. However, in the case of the crane, bulldozer, and airport, the accessory is operated by the vehicle's drive wheels acting on a roller, (as it continues to be powered in reverse, whilst pushing against a stop block).\n\n'''Controllers''': Since this was a roadway system instead of a race track, the controllers were not hand-held, but were intended to resemble the [[dashboard]] of a truck. Originally separate and attached to the track via some wires, each controller had a [[steering wheel]] (to control the speed) and a switch mounted to the side (to control the direction).\n\nThe first type of controllers are known to exist both with and without the yellow lines on the road surface. The output from the transformer was plugged directly into the terminal rail attached to the two controllers.\n\nLater these individual units were simplified so the steering wheel did both speed and direction. By this time yellow markings had stopped being applied to the road surface.\n\nThe final type of controllers came as one twin unit in the form of a single box, attached to a molded base on the side of the track and these also only had a steering wheel. The transformer connection now plugged directly into the control box instead of the track. \n\nControllers are usually red but some of the final version were molded in green for the G.I. Joe and Stomper sets. The green ones only exist in this final twin version.\n\n== Vehicles & Trucks ==\n[[File:4 US-1 Trucks.jpg|thumb|2 Dump Trucks, a Semi Truck, & Fire Truck]]\nThe core chassis of all vehicles are of the same basic design throughout the range, (with only the Stompers using a different chassis molding) but there were many body types and different colors.\n\nThere were two makes of '''[[Semi-trailer truck|Semi-Tractor]]''' trucks modeled: One a [[Peterbilt]] conventional, the other a [[Kenworth]] C.O.E. ([[cab over engine]]). Both types had four wheels and were made to pull [[Semi-trailers]] in box, tank, flatbed, auto transporter and hopper varieties, using their exposed metal rear chassis weight which was also the Fifth Wheel Coupling.\n\nAll other vehicles except the wrecker and fire truck had plain rear chassis weights, which were hidden by the vehicle body.\n\nThere were three '''six-wheeled Peterbilt trucks''': [[dump truck]] (or tipper), troop carrier and a [[Vehicle recovery|Wrecker]]. On these, the extra axle was mounted under the body assembly.\n\n'''Other vehicles''' included a [[Mack Trucks|Mack]] [[Fire Truck]], [[police car]], [[Taxicab|taxi]], [[Pickup truck]], [[Dodge]] [[Panel van|delivery van]], [[ambulance]], [[Jeep]], and a [[Pontiac Firebird]] [[Coup\u00e9]] - The Firebird appeared in both powered (black color with gold eagle) and unpowered (white with black eagle) form, the latter for towing by the wrecker. The dummy car had a plastic chassis with a metal clip to help engage the jib of the wrecker.\n\n'''Body Colors''' were generally molded in pre-colored plastic, although the earliest known version of the Green and the Red Tipper, the Yellow/Orange and Red/White Strip Peterbilt Semi-tractors were molded in white plastic and given a painted finish. The same is true of the Mack Fire Truck, Airport Taxi, [[Goodyear Tires]] pick-up truck, Black Firebird and even the Police car, which was painted all over white before the blue panels, etc. were added. After-market re-sprays of models are becoming more common, too, they are sometimes offered for sale on Internet auction sites.\n\n'''Variations''': Over the years, a number of changes were made to the Peterbilt tipper mouldings. Following the release of the initial painted versions, production switched to pre-coloured plastic and a small ridge appeared lengthways in the middle of the rear of the dump bed, where the tailgate rested when shut. This ridge did not last long and was removed by the time the tail gate gained a bottom lug and matching receptor in the bucket to aid more secure closing. At the same time the originally round hinges became oval to allow the extra travel needed to open/close it.\n\nThe final change to the tipper bucket was when the tail gate changed to a fat 'T' shape, with 'stubs' added at the top on either side and the hinges were enlarged again and made thinner to accommodate these. This makes them rather fragile too. It is quite common to find these later hinges broken and the tailgate missing, whereas the earlier thicker hinges normally survive.\n\nFrom around 1983, Peterbilt Semis and Tippers both acquired an oval 'Peterbilt' logo on the sides of the hood and the front of the [[Radiator]]. The name \"Peterbilt\" can be clearly seen with a magnifier. Finally, when the tipper chassis was adapted with extra slots to take the troop-carrier body for the GI Joe set in 1984, the opening above the motor was changed from a square to a T shape.\n\nAs of April 2020, none of the plain Green Tippers or the common Semi-Tractors in either yellow and orange (with black stripes) or red (with white stripes)-(Unlighted version), have been found with the Peterbilt logos. Nor have any green Tippers been found with the troop carrier modifications to the base or with the final 'T' shaped tailgate and thinner hinges on the bucket. \n\nAs these truck appeared in several sets that were available until the end of the range, this remains an interesting and so far unexplained anomaly. From the examples seen it would appear that the same is true for the less common red tipper, although this is thought to have only ever been included in one set. However, the red Semi-tractor with white stripes (lighted version), can be found both with and without the Peterbilt logos.\n\nAlthough the Stomper [[Blazer|Blazer]] enjoyed a very short life, variations are known: Test-shot moldings exist that include a clear plastic light bar, although no light bar has ever been found fitted on production models in this series, nor was any US-1 Blazer ever fitted with lights. The headlights on the body shell are just open round holes. Early bodies were supplied fitted with a pair of thin weights, secured sandwich-like, at the rear of the body, by two plastic prongs, melted over to hold them in place. Most examples found seem not to have these.\n\n'''Trailers''' The flat bed trailer comes in two distinct variations. The rear panel is either completely smooth or has a 6mm long ridge across the bottom. All the different color versions of the flat bed can be found both with and without this feature. \nThe ridge appears to have been added later as it also appears on a small number of hopper trailers. \n\nAll post US-1 Box trailers have this too. So far no tank trailers are known with this. See the section '''US-1 Body Shells - Before, After & Outside of US-1''' for information about the non US-1 versions of the Box trailer.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+List of Vehicles, Trucks, & Trailers\n!Trucks\n!Trailers\n!Vehicles\n|-\n|'''Peterbilt Truck Cab'''\n'''(Red with White Stripes)'''\n\n(No.3903 - 1981-1983)\n|'''Box Trailer''' \n'''(Bekins)'''\n\n(No. 3928 - 1981, 1982)\n|'''Stomper Blazer'''\n'''(White and Blue with Red Stripe)'''\n\n(No.3962 - 1985)\n|-\n|'''Peterbilt Truck Cab'''\n'''(Orange and Yellow with Black Stripes)'''\n\n(No.3904 - 1981-1982)\n|'''Gravel Trailer'''\n'''(Gravel Supply Company)'''\n\n(No. 3925 - 1981, 1982)\n|'''Stomper Blazer'''\n'''(Yellow/Gray/White with Orange Stripe)'''\n\n(No.3963 - 1985)\n|-\n|'''Peterbilt Truck Cab'''\n'''(Tan with Initials \"PB\" on Doors)'''\n\n(No.3908 - 1984-1985)\n|'''Gravel Trailer'''\n'''(Highway Construction Company)'''\n\n(No. 3926 - 1981-1984)\n|'''Stomper Pick-Up'''\n'''(Green and White with Black Stripes)'''\n\n(No.3965 - 1985)\n|-\n|'''Kenworth Truck Cab'''\n'''(Black with Yellow/Tan/Orange Stripes)'''\n\n(No.3909 - 1982-1985)\n|'''Box Trailer''' \n'''(Navajo)'''\n\n(No. 3930 - 1981, 1982)\n|'''Stomper Pick-Up'''\n'''(Yellow with Black and White Stripes)'''\n\n(No.3966 - 1985)\n|-\n|'''Kenworth Truck Cab'''\n'''(Blue with White/Yellow/Orange Stripes)'''\n\n(No.3910 - 1982)\n|'''Box Trailer'''\n'''(Pacific Intermountain Express)'''\n\n(No. 3927 - 1981, 1982)\n|'''Pick-Up Truck'''\n'''(Smith's Tire Orange and Black)'''\n\n(No.3951 - 1981-1982)\n|-\n|'''Peterbilt Truck Cab''' \n'''(Coastal Trucking Blue with Gold Stripes)'''\n\n(No.3913 - 1983-1985)\n|'''Box Trailer''' \n'''(Smith Transfer)'''\n\n(No. 3929 - 1981, 1982)\n|Dodge '''Van''' \n'''(Federal Express)'''\n\n(No.3952 - 1981-1982)\n|-\n|'''Kenworth Cab Over Truck Cab''' \n'''(Red/White/Orange)'''\n\n(No.3914 - 1983-1985)\n|'''Flatbed Trailer''' \n'''(Red Line)'''\n\n(No. 3931 - 1982)\n|Dodge Charger '''Police Car''' \n'''(Blue and White)'''\n\n(No.3953 - 1981-1984)\n|-\n|'''Lighted Peterbilt Truck Cab'''\n'''(Tan)'''\n\n(No. 3935 - 1984, 1985)\n|'''Flatbed Trailer''' \n'''(Roadway Express)'''\n\n(No. 3932 - 1982, 1983)\n|Dodge '''Ambulance'''\n(No.3954 - 1981-1984)\n|-\n|'''Lighted Peterbilt Truck Cab''' \n'''(Black with Gold Stripes)'''\n\n(No. 3939 - 1984, 1985)\n|'''Flatbed Trailer with 3 Crates''' \n'''(Roadway Express)'''\n\n(No. 3932 - 1984)\n|Dodge Charger '''Airport Taxi''' \n'''(Blue)'''\n\n(No.3955 - 1981-1982)\n|-\n|'''Peterbilt Dump Truck''' \n'''(Green)'''\n\n(No.3901 - 1981)\n|'''Tank Trailer''' \n'''(Shell)'''\n\n(No. 3940 - 1982-1984)\n|'''Pontiac Firebird''' \n'''(Black)'''\n\n(No.3956 - 1981-1984)\n|-\n|'''Peterbilt Dump Truck''' \n'''(Red)'''\n\n(No.3902 - 1981 and 1983)\n|'''Tank Trailer''' \n'''(Exxon)'''\n\n(No. 3941 - 1982-1984)\n|'''Army Jeep'''\n(No.3957 - 1983-1984)\n|-\n|'''Peterbilt Dump Truck'''\n'''(Red and Tan with Black Stripes)'''\n\n(No.3905 - 1984-1985)\n|'''Tank Trailer''' \n'''(Dupont)'''\n\n(No. 3942 - 1982)\n|'''Fire Truck''' \n'''(Lights, Bell, & Working Ladder)'''\n\n(No. 3911 - 1983-1985)\n|-\n|'''Peterbilt Dump Truck''' \n'''(Blue and Silver)'''\n\n(No.3912 - 1983-1985)\n|'''Tank Trailer''' \n'''(Borden's)'''\n\n(No. 3943 - 1982)\n|'''Peterbilt Wrecker with Disabled Car''' \n'''(Lighted Black Peterbilt with Shell logo; White Firebird)'''\n\n(No. 3918 - 1984, 1985)\n|-\n|'''Lighted Peterbilt Dump Truck''' \n'''(Red and Black)'''\n\n(No. 3937 - 1984, 1985)\n|'''Auto Transport with 4 Cars'''\n(No. 3946 - 1983, 1984)\n|'''G.I.

Some were based on designs which were originally part of the Tyco model railroad range. A full list appears later, but they are each worth describing in detail.\n\n'''Gravel''' \u2013 There was a small brown '''Gravel Unloading''' bin designed to sit under a length of single track that had a small oblong opening and a flat [[billboard]] at the end, where a green 'Gravel' sticker was applied. As the gravel trailer was reversed into this, a raised portion of the roadway engaged with and opened the shutter underneath the trailer, causing the gravel to fall through the opening and into the bin. This special track was later modified, gaining a box with raised sides around the opening, presumably to prevent spillages. Meanwhile, two long slots were also added on the sides to enable use with the '''Elevated Gravel Unloader''' (see below). The brown gravel bin was originally supplied with a tan-painted floor, discontinuing it was probably an early cost-cutting measure.\n\nTo fill the gravel trailer, there was an orange '''Operating Overhead Gravel Hopper''' that stood on a gantry over another type of single-road section (this was also used under the '''Barrel Loader'''). As the gravel trailer was reversed under the hopper it opened a shutter and was filled with gravel, ready to be driven away. This hopper was supplied with a small billboard type 'Gravel' sign that attached to the front of the hopper by two prongs. These are quite vulnerable and today are nearly always found broken. Adhesive putty can be used to mount billboards with broken prongs on the frame of the orange hopper. This is where it was often shown on the set box illustrations - (See Tyco Truck Resource link below).\n\nThe same hopper could be used as part of the '''Elevated Gravel Unloader''' which consisted of a set of '''Elevated Piers''' and a later version of the section of track supplied with the '''Gravel Unloading''' bin. This time that unloading track was intended to be positioned above the hopper, making it possible to fill your gravel trailer, drive around the circuit and then put that same gravel back in the same hopper ready to do it all again! The included instruction sheet shows a track diagram of how to arrange the track to achieve this and details where to position all six graduated height Elevated Piers.\n\nThe '''Gravel Supply Terminal''' was where a gravel trailer could park. Although there was no loading or unloading here, a neat little mechanism allowed the Semi-Tractor to reverse in and automatically hitch or un-hitch the trailer as required. There was a similar '''Freight Terminal''' where one of the Box Trailers could be parked, which worked in much the same way. Usually the gravel terminal mechanism has fewer moving parts than that in the freight terminal, but on early examples the mechanisms were identical.\n\nOriginal US-1 gravel was made of small plastic pellets and was supplied in a sealed clear plastic packet, but is often lost. [[Mung bean|Mung Beans]] look similar and make a perfect replacement.\n\n'''Crates''' \u2013 These are sturdy looking objects which were set out on a gray platform outside a cream shed. This was the '''Crate Loader'''. As the flat trailer was reversed in, it pushed the platform back into the shed and the crates went onto the trailer.\n\nThe '''Crate Unloader''' is a light gray platform at one side of a single track with a small yard on the other. Access was through a tall dark gray hoop from which a hinged flap is hanging. The ominous yellow and black hatchings and the words \u2018Unload Here\u2019 are a clue to what happens \u2013 the trailer loaded with crates is reversed under the flap, which hinges open away from the main road, allowing the trailer and crates to pass beneath, but as the trailer is withdrawn, the flap locks vertical and rigid, then brutally tears the crates from the trailer onto the floor, irrespective of any \u2018Fragile\u2019, \u2018Handle With Care\u2019 or \u2018This Way Up\u2019 stickers that might be applied to them.\n\nIn the Army Transport set this Action Accessory became an '''Ammunition Dump''' with different stickers and the crates were a darker brown. Replica crates have been produced but were not widely available. If originals or replicas are unavailable, a 1\" Wooden Cube suffices. \n\n'''Car Loader''' \u2013 Similar in principle to the crate loader, a double-deck red hollow \u2018cartridge\u2019 is loaded up with the four brightly colored automobiles \u2013 two on each level. The yellow [[Car carrier trailer|car trailer]] reverses against the cartridge, moving it back against a tall red stop block. This causes the four cars to roll forward and fill the two decks of the trailer. The '''Car Unloader''' is a long roadway with an orange gantry leading to two ramps. As the Auto Transporter trailer reverses in, it engages with the gantry, causing the decks to rise up at the cab end, encouraging the cars to roll out of the trailer, onto the ramps and finally come to a rest, spread out on the black cardboard [[Parking Lot]] that is part of this item.\n\n'''Logs''' - These were brown-stained 9mm-diameter wood [[dowel]]s 1.5\u201d long and could be loaded into the dump truck by the '''Log Loader/Elevated Log Loader''', which held the loading device high on an orange girder gantry. It is designed to sit under a high-level roadway, so the loading rig is alongside. The actual loading part consisted of a sloping tray in which the logs are laid. This has a lever that is activated by the tipper truck reversing alongside. This released some of the logs into the truck. The loading portion could be removed from the girder base and clipped alongside track at ground level if desired. The actuating lever is quite fragile and many found today are broken. The lever tends to strike most larger passing vehicles when the loader is clipped in place.\n\n'''Operating Log-Loading Bulldozer''' - is a mechanical accessory of the type for which Tyco were famous. The bulldozer is activated by the motor of the truck that is being loaded. This is [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmitted]] to the mechanism by rollers. Once the truck was reversed in, it rested against a stop block. The power is kept on, causing the [[bulldozer]] to push the logs up a gentle slope and into the body of the truck. There is a driver wearing a blue uniform who sat in the controls of the bulldozer. He is prone to breakage or being lost, as are the exhaust pipes. Once the logs have been loaded and the truck has left, the bulldozer needs resetting by hand and the stock of logs, replenishing. Logs are often missing but dowelling of a suitable thickness (8mm-diameter adequately substitutes the original 9mm size) can be cut to length and stained in a commercial wood stain, or even tea or coffee, to look much the same as the originals.\n\n'''Boulders''' - There is an identical '''Boulder Loading Bulldozer''' which came with some boulders (these are actual small stones not imitations) instead of logs. This is much less common than the log-loading version and seems to have been introduced later. Today suitable replacement stones can be obtained from hobby stores. Tumbled and glazed ones reduce friction and avoid scuffing the surface of the accessory.\n\n'''Pipes''' - The '''Operating Crane Pipe Loader''' was another mechanically activated accessory borrowed from Tyco model railroads. The drive was the same as the bulldozer but activated a crane with a rigid wire hook in the shape of an 'L' to move in a back and forth, up and down movement. As it moved, it scooped up a pipe and deposited it in the rear of the waiting truck which supplied the power. It continued in the same movement while the power was applied. The pipes were 14mm-diameter wide white plastic tubular moulding, in 10mm lengths. These were held on edge in a narrow sloping trough, molded into the base, presenting their open side ready for the crane to engage. As one was taken, the next rolled into place ready for the crane to swing back. The crane did not need any manual intervention, other than more pipes being added when they ran out. Pipes, like logs and gravel are often missing but 15mm-diameter plastic water pipe cut into 10mm lengths makes a perfect substitute.\n\n'''Barrels''' - These are 13mm-diameter, 19mm long and have one end sealed. They are usually molded in off white plastic, but were dark butter yellow in the Army Transport set and white in the Stomper Set. The same barrel-molding was used as a load for a brown slat-sided semi-trailer in the TYCO TCR series, although in a luminous yellow plastic.\n\nThese were held in the '''Barrel Loader''' - a brown sloping rack mounted on a yellow girder frame. As the tipper truck reversed, it engaged with a lever that released some barrels, which rolled from the rack into the truck. A version with a blue sloping rack and the same yellow frame was shown in publicity material and on the carton of the Motor City set. All examples found have the same brown loader as all the others, but with '''Motor City Oil Co.''' stickers with blue writing on a white background. As yet, no substitute barrels have been found, but a 19mm-long, suitable-diameter pipe or dowel would probably suffice.\n\n'''Unloading Yards''' - There were two varieties, the more common '''Pipe and Log Unloading Yard''', which had a grey base and brown walls. This was sold separately, as well as being in most in most sets, and also appeared with blue walls in the 3209 Motor City Set. The blue unloading yard is labeled with Goodyear stickers and according to catalog illustrations was intended to receive tires, although a way of loading them was not devised. In the Army Transport Set, the standard brown-walled Unloading Yard became an '''Army Dump''' with different stickers.\n\nThe second smaller Unloading Yard arrived later and is much harder to find. It is on a 9\" 45 degree double turnout supplied in the 3213 Highways Wrecker Set and 3219 Night Haulers Set. Originally this track was just a double turnout, but a small unloading yard with brown walls was added on one side of the junction and most of these sections that are found have this.\n\nThe Unloading Yards worked by the lip at the entrance of the yard engaging with the 'steps' or 'mud flaps' on the rear of the reversing tipper's bucket. This causes it to rise, the tailgate to open and the goods to slide out into the yard. Logs, pipes, barrels, tires and presumably boulders could all be deposited in the unloading yards but not gravel, simply because the rear of the tipper was too large to go under the hopper.\n\n'''Airport''' - This mechanical accessory lacks any loading or unloading function. The rollers transmit the drive from the vehicle to the orange [[radar]] dish on a white cap, which rotates atop the terminal building. Attached to the inside of the cap is a long, rigid wire. On the far end of this is a small plastic plane. As the radar revolves in an [[Clockwise|anti-clockwise]] direction, the plane circulates the tower, soaring up and coming back down, over and over again, almost landing and then taking off. There is a cardboard mat supplied for the building to stand on which includes a short section of [[Runway|runway]].\n\nThis is popular at shows, causing gasps and wows as the plane appears to fly. There are two planes provided and they are both rather small for the scale of the trucks and the buildings. One of them is in [[FedEx]] livery, so a good vehicle to use with this would be the FedEx delivery van or the Airport Taxi, whilst the Semi-Tractor shown on the box looks rather out of place.\n\nThe radar dish is fragile and often broken or missing. The walls are blue and the windows lined in white with the word 'Airport' on the blue roof in big white letters. This was mainly sold as a separate item but appeared in one set (in this form), the 3225 Coast to Coast Set.\n\nThe Airport appeared again with brown walls and a gray roof, as the '''Forest Rescue''' centre in the very rare 3211 Stomper Set. This time the radar and cap were moulded in butter yellow and the plane has simpler decoration to allow for the application of the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] stickers and Forest Rescue markings.\n\n'''G. I. Joe Satellite Launcher''' - This consisted of a two-piece sculpted concrete effect [[launch pad]] area with a straight approach track at the centre of one side. The base unit for the pad was clearly derived from the 3440 Unloading Yard.\n\nThe pivoting launching [[Gantry (rocketry)|gantry]] folds down horizontally, in line with the roadway, in order to engage with a [[missile]] loaded on a flatbed trailer as it is reversed towards it. In this position the launch gantry engages with the hollow missile and as the trailer backs further the gantry pivots to bring the missile to the upright position.\n\nMissiles are normally white with a gray cap but a few rare examples are known to have red caps. The gantry is a very delicate white plastic molding and many found today have broken pivot arms. This accessory was exclusive to the GI Joe set and was never available separately.\n\n'''Garage Type Buildings''' - This basic structure appeared in different colours, with different signs to serve as three differently purposed buildings, all with road access:\n\n1/ '''Highway Wrecker Set with Lighted Wrecker, Tow Car & Garage''' - The building was yellow with an orange roof and petrol pump. There also a special piece of single straight track with switch that allowed the towed car, the White Firebird, to be unhitched as it was reversed in to the opening.\n\n2/ '''Fire Station with Switch Track & Storage Yard''' - was a red version of the building with a black roof. This came off a different track section that formed a tuning-fork shape. The Fire station stood over the right lane, whilst the left lane was open. As a vehicle drove in to one lane, the turnout automatically switched to the other, isolating the first vehicle. There was a representation of a [[Siren (alarm)|siren]] on the roof of this building, which looks a bit like chimney.\n\n3/ '''Garage with Switch Track & Truck Stop''' - This was similar to the fire station, but had white walls, a blue roof, red windows, etc. It had the same track section as the fire station and operated in the same way. There was no siren or petrol pump.\n\n'''Flashing Danger Track''' - came with a '''15\" Straight Squeeze Track''' where one lane moved towards the other to avoid a hazard. This made it impossible for two vehicles to pass simultaneously. There is a red beacon with a flashing yellow light that sits at the side of the road warning oncoming vehicles. This accessory needed two AA batteries.\n\n'''3673 Overhead Interstate Highway Signs''' were sold in packs. These contained six gray over-road lattice gantries that each had two blank sign panels and sheets of different stickers to apply to them. They were also supplied in every US-1 set, including the Stomper Set with some special labels, including one for a Stomper Garage.\n\nMost of the stickers provided relate to the various action stations: Log Loader 3 Miles Ahead, Dump Site, Motor City Car Lot, Freight Terminal, Gravel Terminal, Gravel Hopper, Oil Refinery, etc. (There was never an Oil Refinery Action Station). The stickers have a tendency to dry out and fall off over time and the gantries themselves are delicate and prone to breakage, deformation and yellowing.\n\nThe earlier gantries have a clearance height of 60mm from the ground and have 35mm long flat feet on either side intended to be tucked under the track. These are not very effective at standing up and are too low for the loaded car transporter to pass beneath.\n\nThe later type of gantries have a 70mm clearance from the ground and the feet are only 25mm long, but each has a wedge shape projecting against the side of the track. The newer design clips positively against the track and usually remains there.\n\nIn place, the gantries are scenic, but tend to obstruct the cleaning of contact rails or attending to a vehicle.\n\n'''3768 Overhead Highway Light''' is a neat little gray streetlamp, set on a huge base that housed an AA battery and was operated by a switch. The bulb is a Grain of Wheat type mounted in the head with a reflector behind. These are surprisingly effective when they work, but they often don't, due to failed bulbs, broken switches and corrosion from leaky batteries.\n\nAlthough never sold separately, the light gray '''US-1 Elevated Piers''' appeared in four of the trucking sets and were a key part of the '''3453 Elevated Gravel Unloader'''. A set of piers included two of each. Pier 1 is 19mm high, number 2 is 38mm and pier 3 reached a height of 57mm. In the top of each pier was a 11mm-diameter round hole that engaged with the corresponding round lugs on the underside of most lengths of US-1 Track.\n\nBesides the piers, elevated items in the US-1 series included the '''Elevated Gravel Unloader''' which required the track to be at 73mm from the base and the '''Elevated Log Loader''' which needed it to be at 76mm high. The US-1 piers are the same as those sold to use with Tyco Quick Clik racing track although these were often cream instead of light gray. The shape of the pillars (a gently tapered series of progressively smaller concentric oblongs), goes back to the Tyco Pro series of track, although the top fixings of those were not compatible with US-1 or Quick Clik.\n\n'''Working Height:''' Although sold for potential use with an HO-scale model railroad, the US-1 elevated track has a clearance of 57mm provided by the high level piers, which is insufficient to clear a train running below. This is made worse if a 'roadbed' type model railroad track is used, where the track sits on some imitation ballast, raising the height of the rails by several mm.\n\n57mm is also too low to allow a loaded car transporter pass underneath. However, as the elevated piers are hollow, it is possible to stack them upon each other, to give the extra height required, provided enough can be found.\n\nIt is still possible to get packs of brand new unused (old stock) Tyco piers from at least one supplier on the Internet. One layout that can be seen on a video app has a high level circuit supported by 87mm high pillars which have been created from 3 of the middle rise piers firmly stacked together. This height is enough to clear an HO Railroad on a roadbed type track, as well as any US-1 road circuit running a loaded car transporter.\n\nThere were also three [[Plastic model|Plastic Construction Kits]]: a '''[[Mobil Oil|Mobil Truck Station]]''', a '''[[Howard Johnson's|Howard Johnson's Truck Stop]]''', and a '''P.I.E. Freight Terminal''', each molded in several colors to be glued together. These were supplied by Pola, in what was then [[West Germany]] and were also sold for a time as part of the Tyco model railroad range, but in plain Tyco 'Brown Box' packaging and with slightly different names and in some cases different colourings or markings. The Truck station and Freight Terminal kits have appeared in other ranges over the years and are still available, but now as part of the [[Wm. K. Walthers|Walther's]] Trainline range and with different colourings and markings.\n\n=== Sets ===\nMost US-1 pieces came together in a series of sets, based on certain duties a truck would need to do. Numerous sets came out between 1981 and 1986, each with varied action accessories as described above. Some sets were themed, such as the 3235 Road & Rail set, with a complete railroad and two of the 3727 grade crossings, or the 3217 G.I. Joe High Adventure Set, based around soldiers and their equipment.\n\nThe vehicles supplied in the sets were however only a small selection of those available: The Peterbilt tipper appeared in most sets (except the G.I. Joe, Highway Wrecker and Stomper Sets) - Usually in the standard lime green, but was olive green especially for the army transport set and is believed to have been red in the rare Empire Set\n\nThe Peterbilt Semi-tractor was also included in most sets, (except Army Transport, Fire Alert and Stomper sets) the colors being red with white stripes or yellow with orange and black stripes (both are consequently common colors for this vehicle). It was in Army Green in the GI Joe set.\n\nThe Kenworth Semi-tractor was only sold in two sets - appearing in blue with stripes in the Fire Alert set, whilst the olive version was exclusive to the Army Transport set. In the Night Haulers set the Green tipper and the Red Peterbilt semi-tractor were both lighted versions\n\nOther vehicles featuring in sets are the Fire Truck, Wrecker, Dummy Firebird, Stomper Blazer, Stomper Pick Up and the Cobra Troop carrier which was only available in the G.I. Joe set\n\nThe G.I. Joe set also came with soldiers, tanks, jeeps, a helicopter, a boat, a bridge, paratroopers, a die-cut Secret Cobra Command Headquarters, a full-color G.I. Joe Action Battle Mat (with Mountain Backdrop) and a unique '''Satellite Launching Pad with Gantry''' Action Accessory.\n\nArguably, one of the rarest and most expensive sets has a [[Schaper Toys|Schaper]] Stompers theme. Only produced in 1985, complete examples are very rare. It contains a special version of the Airport in brown (3434), unique this set. A die-cut cardboard building can be folded to make a garage for the cars. The set sits on a Stompers-themed playmat, with a portion of the track supported by Elevated Piers.\n\nAnother rare set is the 3213 Highway Wrecker Set, released in 1984. This set contains a gravel loader, gravel unloader, garage, double turnout, special straight with [[Telephone booth|phone booth]], billboard sign.

This is usually because most sections of US-1 track were just a gray variant of the Quick Clik black racing track. Some items can be found with a racing and US-1 reference underneath - the Squeeze track and the Lane changer for example, but even then the number molded is usually a part number rather than a catalogue number. For example the bespoke 9\" Junction carries the reference 3016 beneath but was listed as 3700. Most separate track appears to have been sold in pairs in carded blister packs except the 9\" junction and the railroad crossing which were individually sold in blister packs and the squeeze track which was sold with the flashing beacon in an illustrated box.\n\nWe have listed the special and rare 'set only' items of track in the table above by their molded numbers, to help identify them.\n\nThere were several different '''Assortment Packs''' advertised in the annual catalogs. These contained substantial quantities of track, and other items such as Street Lamps or Overhead Signs. The contents and reference numbers changed over time, but the packs always appeared to contain three transformers and three controllers, which seems rather odd. It is not known how these were packaged and they were never shown on retail price lists, so they may well have been aimed at dealers.\n\nBoulder Loading Bulldozer*  - Two reference numbers have come to light for this item: 3414 is shown on literature enclosed with the accessory, whilst 3470 appears in the 1984 and 1985 Tyco catalogs. Both are shown above. Anyone with access to a box for this please feel free to update!\n\n==US-1 Body Shells - Before, After & Outside of US-1 ==\nThe Peterbilt Semi-Tractor had preceded the US-1 range, being introduced in 1979 on the lighted HP2 racing chassis and a slotless, lighted Command Control chassis. The latter was black with flames and no hole in the fifth wheel - or sometimes a hole, which was too small for the later trailers.\n\nCommand Control was Tyco\u2019s first attempt at slotless racing and a direct competitor to the original [[Ideal Toy Company|Ideal]] [[Total Control Racing]] or TCR. The same body was later used again in the Tyco version of the Slotless TCR system produced from 1991 to 1993\n\nBoth the Peterbilt and Kenworth Semi-tractor moldings were used in racing form, with a chromed plastic fifth wheel, which was initially attached by a rivet and two melted-over plastic side pegs to the platform behind the driver\u2019s cab. On later Peterbilts the rivet was deleted and the side pegs were considered enough, although the rivet hole remained. \n\nTwo versions of the Kenworth 'Cab over' Semis were available in racing form between 1983 and 1985 with HP7 chassis. One is mainly black with a red stripe that has white edges and the other mainly white with blue patches and orange stripes. \n\nMost of the racing and Slotless Semi-tractor bodies can be easily adapted to fit a US-1 chassis by drilling out the hollow rivet and pegs that hold the chromed plastic fifth wheel in place. Any vehicle so modified will have three evenly spaced tell-tale holes visible on the platform just behind the cab. On some early examples of the Peterbilt Semi-Tractor this rear platform is lower and consequently these bodies will not fit a US-1 chassis without further work.\n\nThe Peterbilt Semi bodies that won't fit on a US-1 chassis can be identified by their colors: Baby Blue with Black Stripes or White with Red Stripes. Also some in Yellow with fine Orange and Red Stripes or Black with Flames used the original version of the body as well as the later version that will fit. Some of these had gray grills and exhausts instead of Chrome.\n\nOf the many US-1 trailers, only the box type made it into the racing series, appearing in various color schemes. The later had a redesigned reversible bogie with a slot-guide plus a bar magnet to encourage it to stay on the track, although some are known to carry the US-1-type bogie. At the front end, these box trailers kept their US-1 style pivot, allowing them to be run with US-1 Semi-Tractors.\n\nThe Dodge Van can be found in various liveries in racing form and also in Tyco TCR form as the Blue and White \u2018Emergency\u2019 Jam Car. This featured the red light-bar that had been used on the US-1 Mack Fire Truck.\n\nPolice Cars: There is a US-1 publicity photo showing a four-door [[Plymouth Satellite]] in use as the US-1 Police Car: with roof lights, a large hood mounted blower and side pipes, but this was never released as part of the US-1 range. (See the Tyco Resource in the '''External Links''' section Below - Vehicles page)\n\nThe US-1 \u2018911\u2019 police car and Airport Taxi were based on the two-door [[Dodge Charger]] that had been introduced to the Tyco range back in 1977. This was done without \u2018door-netting\u2019 on the glazing and the body was modified to take the roof lights for the police car. The Charger remained in the Tyco racing range until 2005.\n\nOther US-1 vehicles that can be found with a racing chassis are the Jeep in civilian colors which was available from 1980 to 1983 and the Black and Gold Firebird which was sold from 1979 to 1983 but was to eventually reappear in 2005 and 2006 in two special sets.\n\nThere are eight non-US-1 versions of the Stomper Blazer, five of which were equipped with lights, that the US-1 version never carried. One was sold as part of the Faller AMS series. The three 'flame paint' versions had no lights\n\nThe Mack Fire Truck was also sold as part of the Faller AMS range, both individually (cat no. 5631) and in the 'Feuer Alarm' set (Cat no. 3907), which also contained a lighted blue and white racing version of the Pontiac Firebird. These were both introduced in 1983 and the truck was catalogued for at least two years. From two examples seen, it would appear to be the standard US-1 offering, with the same chassis, mechanical bell, lights and American markings. Even the molded 'Tyco H.K.'markings were underneath.\n\nUnusually, at this late stage, Faller AMS had extensive links to Aurora AFX. The Fire Truck appeared in the Faller range alongside some of the same Semi-Tractors and trailers which were also sold as part of the Aurora 'Big Ryder' series, (which was their answer to Tyco US-1), as well as other Tyco offerings.\n\n== Spare Parts, Running and Collecting ==\n'''Spare parts:''' Some parts, such as pick-ups, were originally available from the manufacturers, but today these are hard to find. Luckily a number of people have begun producing parts to keep US-1 vehicles running. Tires which fit all the standard vehicles are available from a number of vendors. Specially stamped and shaped replacement pick-ups can be obtained too, which fit all the vehicles in the series, (including the Stompers). Recently, batches of light bars for the wrecker and fire engine have been made, along with the unique tires for the Stomper and some US-1-type metal guide pins. Their availability can be seen on the Internet.\n\n'''Motor''': The motor used throughout US-1 was a standard [[Mabuchi Motor|Mabuchi]] item and can also be found fitted to other vehicles, including 'Ideal' Slot Cars, later some slotless Tyco TCR 'Jam Cars'. [[New old stock]] spares can sometimes be found and many similar, but not identical motors were made. When checking a Mabuchi motor to see if it will be a suitable replacement, the available length of the shaft to take the worm gear and the position of the contacts (which is on the side of US-1 motors) need to be considered.\n\n'''Customised items and Replicas:''' One vendor specialises in making double 90 degree turnouts out of two single ones, along with 9\" and 6\" single straights. All very handy when maximising layout space. Vendors offering trucks, trailers, loads and Action Accessories in custom finishes, such as FedEx, can often be found on a well known Internet auction site\n\n'''Running suggestions:''' To run US-1 (and not use the original control gear), wires can be carefully soldered to the underside of the two contact strips, but given the age and condition of the track, it is recommended that as the layout size increases, the number of 'feeds' to each circuit are increased to avoid voltage drop. US-1 track has not always aged well and much found will have discolored or had minor bits broken off at the joints. To obtain the best running results, use the best track available and clean it well: Wash and scrub with a good detergent and then dry it thoroughly. Give the contact strips a rub with an abrasive track-cleaning block, (like those used for model railroads) and pay particular attention to the areas where the metal contact strips join. Treatment of the metal strips with a non-damaging contact oil can be helpful, but try to avoid getting any on the road surface.\n\n'''Integration with Other Makes:''' US-1 vehicles will run on most other makes of HO slot car track, but the Action Accessories can only be connected to Tyco US-1 track via the special US-1 turnouts. US-1 track is a gray version of Tyco Quick Clik and this is compatible with the later Mattel track.  Adaptor sections to join Quick Clik to the older Tyco Pro and Life-Like Racing tracks have been made, but only the [[Round 2 (company)|Auto World]] 'Tyco Quick Clik to Tomy AFX' type appears to still be in production.\n\nVehicles from this range are relatively wide, so if two trucks are simultaneously run on an earlier, narrower slot-car track, like Playcraft Highways or [[Aurora Plastics Corporation|Aurora Model Motoring]], they will collide.\n\nNon US-1 vehicles can be run on Trucking layouts, but lighter types like Aurora [[Pancake (slot car)|TJets]] will get 'beached' on the sprung copper tongues at the junctions, wheras Magnetic slot cars will generally cope quite well as they usually have enough 'virtual' weight to pass through them.\n\n'''Control Gear:''' In the experience of this contributor, (from running various makes of model electric roadways for around 35 years), the best type of controller to use is a Model Railroad 'feedback' type. These give good speed control and steady constant speed running, (resistance types of many makes have been tried but can cause erratic running). Videos exist showing the trucks being successfully run with Model Railroad [[Digital Command Control]] 'electronic chips' fitted. This is not for the faint-hearted and can also be expensive.\n\n'''Servicing:''' Any vehicle obtained will need a good clean, and the tunnel weight temporarily removed by prising the side with a small flat screwdriver. This allows removal of fluff, which accumulates around the worm screw and rear axle. Lightly oil the motor bearings, axles and gears, replace the tires if they are hardened and the pick ups, too, if they are 'rutted'.\n\n'''Fitting Replacement Pick Ups:''' Do not pre-bend them, the cast plate that holds them into the chassis will automatically set them to correct angle as they are screwed into place. (Pre-bending them can exert to much force on the roadway, resulting in lost traction). However it is important to ensure that the folded 'retaining brackets' at the ends of the strips are free to travel up and down in their open mountings. On the Semi-Tractors ensure that the 'return' portion of these brackets does not rub against the Fifth Wheel weight, or it will stop it moving freely and may cause a short circuit.\n\n'''Videos:''' Although today models and sets are bought by collectors, many US-1 trucks are operated either at home or at public shows. Videos showing this can be found on some video apps. Some of the films show the various loading and unloading accessories in action and original commercials for the range can be found, too: Search for 'Tyco Trucking' or 'Tyco US-1'.\n\n==External links==\nUS-1 Trucking Resource [http://tycotrain.tripod.com/tycous1trucking/]\n\nDerek A Brand - Tribute Page = [http://www.daveshobby.net/derek-brand-tribute.html]\n\nHistory of HO Slot Car racing [http://www.hoslotcarracing.com/History.html]\n\nTyco Catalogs (Year by year, page by page) [https://www.hoseeker.org/tyco.htm]\n\n==See also==\n* [[U.S. 1 (comics)]], a [[Marvel Comics]] series licensed from this toyline, set in the [[Marvel Universe]].\n\n[[Category:Toy cars and trucks]]\n\n\n{{Toy-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Highwayman97", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eVehicles & Trucks:tidy", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US-1_Trucks"}

At that time, most of the area remained covered with forests and [[Marsh|marshlands]], through which the Paondhoi, Dhamola and Ganda Nala rivers flowed. The climate was humid and [[Malaria|malaria]] outbreaks were common. [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]], the Sultan of Delhi (1325\u20131351), undertook a campaign in the northern ''doab'' to crush the rebellion of the [[Siwalik Hills|Shivalik]] kings in 1340, when according to local tradition he learned of the presence of a [[sufi]] saint on the banks of the Paondhoi River. After visiting the sage, he ordered that henceforth this region would be known as 'Shah-Haroonpur', after the Sufi Saint ''Shah Haroon Chishti''.<ref>[http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V21_375.gif History] [[The Imperial Gazetteer of India]], v. 21, p.&nbsp;369. 1909.</ref> The simple but well-preserved tomb of this saint is situated in the oldest quarter of Saharanpur city, between the Mali Gate/Bazar Dinanath and Halwai Hatta. By the end of the 14th century, the power of the Sultanate had declined and it was attacked by Emperor [[Timur]] (1336\u20131405) of Central Asia. Timur had marched through the Saharanpur region in 1399 to sack Delhi and people of the region fought his army unsuccessfully. A weakened Sultanate was later conquered by the Central Asian Mogul king [[Babur]] (1483\u20131531).\n\n===Mughal period===\nDuring the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal period]], [[Akbar]] (1542\u20131605), Saharanpur became an administrative unit under the Province of Delhi. Akbar bestowed the feudal ''[[jagir]]'' of Saharanpur to the Mughal treasurer, Sah Ranveer Singh, an [[Agrawal Jain]]<ref name=\"indiatvnews.com\"/> who laid the foundations of the present-day city on the site of an army cantonment. The nearest settlements at that time were [[Shekhpura]] and Malhipur. Saharanpur was a walled city, with five gates: The Hathi Gate the Sarai Gate, the Mali Gate, the Buria Gate, and the Lakhi Gate. The city was divided into the neighbourhoods of Nakhasa Bazar, Shah Behlol, Rani Bazar and Lakhi Gate. The ruins of Shah Ran Veer Singh's old fort can still be seen in the Chaudharian locality of Saharanpur, not far from the better known 'Bada-Imam-bada'. He also built a large [[Jain]] [[Temple|temple]] in Muhallah/Toli Chaundhariyan,<ref>Madhu Jain, O. C. Handa, and Omacanda Handa, ''Wood Handicraft: A Study of Its Origin and Development in Saharanpur'', Indus Publishing (2000), pp.&nbsp;22\u201324. {{ISBN|81-7387-103-5}}</ref> it is now known as the 'Digamber-Jain Panchayati Mandir'.\n\n===The Sayyids and Rohillas===\nMughal emperors Akbar and later [[Shah Jehan]] (1592\u20131666) bestowed the administrative ''[[pargana]]'' of Sarwat on Muslim [[Sayyid]] families. In 1633 one of them founded a city and named it and the surrounding region [[Muzaffarnagar]], in honour of his father, Sayyid Muzaffar Ali Khan. The Sayyids ruled the area until the 1739 invasion by [[Nadir Shah]]. After his departure, anarchy prevailed across the entire ''doab'' with the region ruled or ravaged in succession by Rajputs, Tyagis, Brahmins, and Jats. Taking advantage of this anarchy, the [[Rohillas]] took control of the entire Trans-Gangetic region.\n\n[[Ahmad Shah Durrani]], the [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] ruler who invaded Northwestern and Northern India in the 1750s, conferred the territory of Saharanpur as Jagir on Rohilla chief Najaf Khan, who assumed the title of Nawab Najeeb-ud-Daula and took up residence in Saharanpur in 1754. He made Gaunsgarh his capital and tried to strengthen his position against [[Maratha Empire]] attacks by entering an alliance with the [[Hindu]] [[Gurjar]] chieftain Manohar Singh. In 1759, Najeeb-ud-Daula issued a Deed of Agreement handing over 550 villages to Manohar Singh, who became the Raja of Landaura. Thus the Rohillas and the Gurjars now controlled Saharanpur.\n\n===Maratha rule (1757\u20131803 AD)===\nIn 1757, the Maratha army invaded the Saharanpur region, which resulted in Najeeb-ud-Daula losing control of Saharanpur to the Maratha rulers [[Raghunathrao|Raghunath Rao]] and [[Malharao Holkar]]. The conflict between Rohillas and Marathas came to an end on 18{{nbsp}}December 1788 with the arrest of Ghulam Qadir, the grandson of Najeeb-ud-Daula, who was defeated by the Maratha general [[Mahadji Scindia|Mahadaji Scindia]]. The most significant contribution of Nawab Ghulam Qadir to Saharanpur city is the Nawab Ganj area and the Ahmedabadi fortress therein, which still stands. The death of Ghulam Qadir put an end to the Rohilla administration in Saharanpur and it became the northernmost district of the Maratha Empire. Ghani Bahadur Banda was appointed its first Maratha governor. The Maratha Regime saw the construction of the Bhuteshwar Temple and Bagheshwar Temple in Saharanpur city. In 1803, following the [[Second Anglo-Maratha War]], when the [[British East India Company]] defeated the Maratha Empire, Saharanpur came under British suzerainty.\n\n===British colonial period (1803\u20131947 AD)===\nWhen India rebelled in 1857 against the foreign Company's occupation, now referred to as the First War of Indian Independence, the Saharanpur and the present-day Muzaffarnagar Districts were part of that uprising. The center of freedom fighters' operations was Shamli, a small town in the Muzaffarnagar region which was liberated for some time. After the uprising failed, British retribution was severe. Death and destruction were particularly directed against the Muslims of the region, whom the British considered as the main instigators of the rebellion; Muslim society was devastated beyond recognition. When social reconstruction started, the cultural and political history of Muslims began to revolve around Deoband and Aligarh. Maulana Muhammad Qasim Nanotvi and Maulana Rashid Ahmad Gangohi, both proponents of the reformer Shah Waliullah's ideology for social and political rejuvenation, established a school in Deoband in 1867. It found popularity and global recognition as the Darul Uloom. Its founders' mission was twofold: to raise and spread a team of scholars able to awaken the religious and social consciousness of Muslims through peaceful methods and to make efforts, through them, to educate Muslims in their faith and culture; and to bring about a feeling of nationalism and national unity by promoting the concept of Hindu-Muslim unity and a united India.

At that time, most of the area remained covered with forests and [[Marsh|marshlands]], through which the Paondhoi, Dhamola and Ganda Nala rivers flowed. The climate was humid and [[Malaria|malaria]] outbreaks were common. [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]], the Sultan of Delhi (1325\u20131351), undertook a campaign in the northern ''doab'' to crush the rebellion of the [[Siwalik Hills|Shivalik]] kings in 1340, when according to local tradition he learned of the presence of a [[sufi]] saint on the banks of the Paondhoi River. After visiting the sage, he ordered that henceforth this region would be known as 'Shah-Haroonpur', after the Sufi Saint ''Shah Haroon Chishti''.<ref>[http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V21_375.gif History] [[The Imperial Gazetteer of India]], v. 21, p.&nbsp;369. 1909.</ref> The simple but well-preserved tomb of this saint is situated in the oldest quarter of Saharanpur city, between the Mali Gate/Bazar Dinanath and Halwai Hatta. By the end of the 14th century, the power of the Sultanate had declined and it was attacked by Emperor [[Timur]] (1336\u20131405) of Central Asia. Timur had marched through the Saharanpur region in 1399 to sack Delhi and people of the region fought his army unsuccessfully. A weakened Sultanate was later conquered by the Central Asian Mogul king [[Babur]] (1483\u20131531).\n\n===Mughal period===\nDuring the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal period]], [[Akbar]] (1542\u20131605), Saharanpur became an administrative unit under the Province of Delhi. Akbar bestowed the feudal ''[[jagir]]'' of Saharanpur to the Mughal treasurer, Sah Ranveer Singh, an [[Agrawal Jain]]<ref name=\"indiatvnews.com\"/> who laid the foundations of the present-day city on the site of an army cantonment. The nearest settlements at that time were [[Shekhpura]] and Malhipur. Saharanpur was a walled city, with five gates: The Hathi Gate the Sarai Gate, the Mali Gate, the Buria Gate, and the Lakhi Gate. The city was divided into the neighbourhoods of Nakhasa Bazar, Shah Behlol, Rani Bazar and Lakhi Gate. The ruins of Shah Ran Veer Singh's old fort can still be seen in the Chaudharian locality of Saharanpur, not far from the better known 'Bada-Imam-bada'. He also built a large [[Jain]] [[Temple|temple]] in Muhallah/Toli Chaundhariyan,<ref>Madhu Jain, O. C. Handa, and Omacanda Handa, ''Wood Handicraft: A Study of Its Origin and Development in Saharanpur'', Indus Publishing (2000), pp.&nbsp;22\u201324. {{ISBN|81-7387-103-5}}</ref> it is now known as the 'Digamber-Jain Panchayati Mandir'.\n\n===The Sayyids and Rohillas===\nMughal emperors Akbar and later [[Shah Jehan]] (1592\u20131666) bestowed the administrative ''[[pargana]]'' of Sarwat on Muslim [[Sayyid]] families. In 1633 one of them founded a city and named it and the surrounding region [[Muzaffarnagar]], in honour of his father, Sayyid Muzaffar Ali Khan. The Sayyids ruled the area until the 1739 invasion by [[Nadir Shah]]. After his departure, anarchy prevailed across the entire ''doab'' with the region ruled or ravaged in succession by Rajputs, Tyagis, Brahmins, and Jats. Taking advantage of this anarchy, the [[Rohillas]] took control of the entire Trans-Gangetic region.\n\n[[Ahmad Shah Durrani]], the [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] ruler who invaded Northwestern and Northern India in the 1750s, conferred the territory of Saharanpur as Jagir on Rohilla chief Najaf Khan, who assumed the title of Nawab Najeeb-ud-Daula and took up residence in Saharanpur in 1754. He made Gaunsgarh his capital and tried to strengthen his position against [[Maratha Empire]] attacks by entering an alliance with the [[Hindu]] [[Gurjar]] chieftain Manohar Singh. In 1759, Najeeb-ud-Daula issued a Deed of Agreement handing over 550 villages to Manohar Singh, who became the Raja of Landaura. Thus the Rohillas and the Gurjars now controlled Saharanpur.\n\n===Maratha rule (1757\u20131803 AD)===\nIn 1757, the Maratha army invaded the Saharanpur region, which resulted in Najeeb-ud-Daula losing control of Saharanpur to the Maratha rulers [[Raghunathrao|Raghunath Rao]] and [[Malharao Holkar]]. The conflict between Rohillas and Marathas came to an end on 18{{nbsp}}December 1788 with the arrest of Ghulam Qadir, the grandson of Najeeb-ud-Daula, who was defeated by the Maratha general [[Mahadji Scindia|Mahadaji Scindia]]. The most significant contribution of Nawab Ghulam Qadir to Saharanpur city is the Nawab Ganj area and the Ahmedabadi fortress therein, which still stands. The death of Ghulam Qadir put an end to the Rohilla administration in Saharanpur and it became the northernmost district of the Maratha Empire. Ghani Bahadur Banda was appointed its first Maratha governor. The Maratha Regime saw the construction of the Bhuteshwar Temple and Bagheshwar Temple in Saharanpur city. In 1803, following the [[Second Anglo-Maratha War]], when the [[British East India Company]] defeated the Maratha Empire, Saharanpur came under British suzerainty.\n\n===British colonial period (1803\u20131947 AD)===\nWhen India rebelled in 1857 against the foreign Company's occupation, now referred to as the First War of Indian Independence, the Saharanpur and the present-day Muzaffarnagar Districts were part of that uprising. The center of freedom fighters' operations was Shamli, a small town in the Muzaffarnagar region which was liberated for some time. After the uprising failed, British retribution was severe. Death and destruction were particularly directed against the Muslims of the region, whom the British considered as the main instigators of the rebellion; Muslim society was devastated beyond recognition. When social reconstruction started, the cultural and political history of Muslims began to revolve around Deoband and Aligarh. Maulana Muhammad Qasim Nanotvi and Maulana Rashid Ahmad Gangohi, both proponents of the reformer Shah Waliullah's ideology for social and political rejuvenation, established a school in Deoband in 1867. It found popularity and global recognition as the Darul Uloom. Its founders' mission was twofold: to raise and spread a team of scholars able to awaken the religious and social consciousness of Muslims through peaceful methods and to make efforts, through them, to educate Muslims in their faith and culture; and to bring about a feeling of nationalism and national unity by promoting the concept of Hindu-Muslim unity and a united India. Muslim scholars in the city of Saharanpur were active supporters of this ideology and went on to establish the Mazahirul Uloom Saharanpur theological seminary six months later.\n\n===Royal Family===\n\nIn 1845 Nawab Rao Wazir-ud-din khan became the member and voter of Mughal Darbar at [[Red fort]] [[Delhi]] due to his cordial relation with Mugal Emperor [[Bahadur Shah Zafar]]. He was the richest person of district Saharanpur with 52 thousand bega land and lord of 57 villages like Shaikhpura, Landohra, Tapri, Piragpur, Yousfpur, Badshapur, Harhati, Nazirpura, Santgarh, Lakhnor, Subri, Pathri, etc., of district Saharanpur.

Tracing its history as far back as 1943, it came into operational service in 1961 and was still in use at the time of the [[Falklands War]] in 1982.\n\nSeaslug was intended to engage high-flying targets such as reconnaissance aircraft or bombers before they could launch stand-off weapons. It was only fitted to the Royal Navy's eight [[County-class destroyer]]s which were designed around the missile system.  Later improvements meant that it could also be used against ships. Seaslug was only fired in anger once as an anti-aircraft missile, from {{HMS|Antrim|D18|6}} during the Falklands War, but missed its target. It was also used for surface bombardment.\n\nSeaslug's medium-range role was to be supplanted by a very long-range missile known as [[Blue Envoy]], but this was passed over in favour of a new medium-range system, [[Sea Dart]]. Sea Dart entered service in 1973 on the [[Type 82 destroyer]]s and replaced Seaslug during the 1980s as the {{sclass2-|County|destroyer}}s were removed from service.\n\n==Development==\n===Initial concept===\nIn 1943, the German ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' began the use of [[anti-shipping missile]]s and guided bombs in the Mediterranean Ocean during Allied operations against Italy. These weapons were released outside of [[anti-aircraft gun]] range, which meant that any operations lacking complete [[air superiority]] would be open to attack with little response by the ships.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=197}} On 16 March 1944 the first meeting of the \"Guided Anti-Aircraft Projectile Committee\", or GAP Committee, was held.{{sfn|Grove|2004|p=193}}\n\nThe [[Admiralty Signals and Radar Establishment|Admiralty Signals Establishment]] (ASE), in charge of the Navy's [[radar]] development, was working on new radars featuring [[radar lock-on]] that allowed them to accurately track aircraft at long range. This was part of the LRS.1 fire-control system that allowed large dual-purpose guns to attack bombers at long range.{{sfn|Harding|2005|p=254}} A contemporary [[British Army]] project at Cossors, [[Brakemine]], was working on a system to allow a missile to keep itself centered within a radar beam, a concept known today as [[beam riding]]. The Navy decided to combine the two concepts, using the LRS.1's Type 909 radar with a new missile that differed from Brakemine primarily in requiring longer range and being more robust for shipborne use.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=197}}\n\nIn December 1944, GAP put out a Naval Staff Target for a new anti-aircraft weapon,{{sfn|Grove|2004|p=193}} capable of attacking targets at altitudes up to 50,000&nbsp;feet and speeds of up to {{convert|700|mph}}.{{sfn|Grove|2004|p=194}} This project was briefly known as LOPGAP, short for \"Liquid Oxygen and Petrol Guided Anti-aircraft Projectile\",{{sfn|Twigge|1993|p=246}} but soon moved from petrol to [[methanol]] which made the \"LOP\" inaccurate, and the name accordingly changed simply to GAP,{{sfn|Morton|1989|p=209}} and then Seaslug. Efforts to change the name to \"Triumph\" failed.{{sfn|Grove|2004|p=194}}\n\n===LOPGAP===\nThe [[Fairey Aviation Company]] was at this time working on a missile project for the Ministry of Supply, [[Fairey Stooge|Stooge]]. Stooge was more like an armed drone aircraft than a missile. It was flown to a location in front of the target and then cruised toward it until being triggered by the operator. Its low speed and manual guidance meant it was not useful for interceptions outside the immediate area of the ship, and thus did not meet the need for a longer-ranged weapon. Accordingly, Fairey was ordered to stop work on Stooge in favour of LOPGAP.{{efn-lr|Existing Stooge airframes continued to be test-fired for a time.}} Development was slowed by the [[Air Ministry]] who were opposed to the project as it might take resources away from jet fighter production{{efn|For unclear reasons, considering they were also working on several missile designs of their own.}} and a lack of urgency on the part of both the Admiralty and [[Ministry of Supply]].{{sfn|Grove|2004|p=194}}\n\nA March 1945 report called for the first test launches of LOPGAP from converted [[QF 3.7-inch AA gun|QF 3.7-inch air-aircraft gun]] mounts (the same were used for Stooge and Brakemine) within two months. They predicted the final system would be about {{convert|19|ft|abbr=on}} long and a twin-launcher would take up about the same room as a twin 5.25-inch gun turret. An April Staff Target called for the system to be able to engage an aircraft flying at {{convert|500|mph|abbr=on}} at altitudes up to {{convert|40,000|ft|abbr=on}} with a maximum weight of {{convert|500|lb|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=179}}\n\nIn a January 1947 Navy review, the program was given the name Seaslug. This called for a significantly larger weapon than initially envisioned in GAP, capable of single-stage vertical launch, a warhead (and guidance) of {{convert|200|lb|kg|abbr=on}} and an all-up weight of {{convert|1800|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Twigge|1993|p=28}} Development continued as before but was significantly hampered by the post-war exodus of engineering talent.{{sfn|Harding|2005|p=254}}\n\n===Move to RAE===\nIn 1945 a new Guided Projectiles Establishment was set up under the Controller of Supplies (Air) and in 1946 development of all ongoing missile projects moved to the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] (RAE) new Controlled Weapons Department, soon to become the Guided Weapons Department.{{sfn|Smith|1965|p=101}} They began considering the beam riding concept in partnership with the [[Telecommunications Research Establishment]] (TRE), the deliberately oddly-named department of the [[Air Ministry]] responsible for [[radar]] development. Over the next year, first Brakemine and then Stooge were moved to the RAE. Seaslug followed in 1947.{{sfn|Smith|1965|p=101}}\n\nDevelopment slowed further, and in July 1947 the Admiralty approached the [[Henry Tizard]] to see a more \"virile leadership\" of the program. Tizard called a meeting of the [[Defense Research Policy Committee]] (DRPC) and started a process of pushing through four key programs that were intended to enter service in 1957, Seaslug, a corresponding Army/Air Force missile known as [[Red Heathen (missile)|Red Heathen]], the [[Blue Boar (bomb)|Blue Boar]] [[television guidance]] [[glide bomb]], and the [[Red Hawk]] [[air-to-air missile]].{{sfn|Grove|2004|p=194}}\n\nIn March 1948 a new report from the DRPC noted there was not enough manpower for all four projects, and put Seaslug at the bottom of the priority list, claiming air attack would be less likely than submarine in the event of war. They suggested the much longer ranged Red Heathen was more important. The Admiralty was of another opinion on the matter.{{sfn|Grove|2004|p=194}}\n\nThe Navy found an unlikely ally in the Army, who were concerned that Red Heathen was too difficult to move to in a single stage and suggested that Seaslug might be the basis for a more immediate medium-range weapon that could be used both on land and sea. The DPRC also began to have concerns about guiding Red Heathen at its {{convert|100000|yd}} maximum range. In September 1948 they agreed to develop Seaslug \"as a matter of insurance\", before further upgrading it in 1949 to \"top priority\".{{sfn|Grove|2004|p=195}} As a result of these changes, the program was seen as having two stages, Stage 1 would deliver missiles in the mid-1950s with roughly {{convert|20|mi}} range with capability mostly against subsonic targets, and a Stage 2 of the early 1960s would have greatly extended range on the order of {{convert|150|mi}} and able to attack supersonic aircraft. \n\n===Experimental systems===\nTwo test systems emerged from this centralization. The CTV.1 was a small unpowered Brakemine-like system devoted to the development of the guidance systems, launched using three [[RP-3]] rocket motors and controlled through the coast phase. A series of CTV designs followed, providing ever-increasing amounts of [[telemetry]] for the guidance and control systems work.{{sfn|Smith|1965|pp=104-105}} GAP became a purely research-oriented system, RTV.1 (rocket test vehicle), as opposed to a prototype missile design, and was used primarily as a platform for testing the rocket motors.{{sfn|Smith|1965|p=105}}{{sfn|Twigge|1993|p=247}} The GAP/RTV.1 efforts would be directed at the Stage 1 design, which would essentially be the Seaslug requirement.\n\nThe relatively small CTV could safely be launched at the Larkhill Range, part of the [[Royal School of Artillery]]. It was equipped with a parachute that allowed it to be recovered. This was not possible for the much longer-ranged RTV, which was fired from [[ParcAberporth|RAF Aberporth]] out over [[Cardigan Bay]] in Wales. The desire to reclaim the RTVs as well led to the opening of a parallel launch facility at the [[RAAF Woomera Range Complex]] and a program that led development of supersonic parachutes.{{sfn|Smith|1965|p=106}}\n\nAs RTV testing continued, the decision was made to build a larger version, RTV.2, which would be more typical of a production missile. During early testing, the design was further modified and renamed GPV, for General Purpose Test Vehicle. Several [[liquid rocket]] motors were tested as part of this program. Early tests demonstrated shifts in the [[center of gravity]] that required active damping, which in turn led to the lengthening of the overall fuselage to become the \"long round\". This version used forward-mounted boosters, which were mounted so their exhaust was just in front of the mid-mounted wings.{{sfn|Smith|1965|p=108}}\n\n===Project 502===\nAs experimental work progressed, the Ministry of Supply began forming an industry team to build production systems. In 1949 this gave rise to the 'Project 502' group from industry, with [[Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft]] and [[Sperry Corporation#British Sperry|Sperry]] in March and [[General Electric Company|GEC]] in September.{{sfn|Twigge|1993|p=28}}\n\nThe 29 July 1949 update of the Staff Target called for a maximum range of {{convert|30000|yd|km|abbr=on}} and a minimum of {{convert|5000|yd|km|abbr=on}}. Maximum altitude should be 55,000&nbsp;ft, but 45,000 would be considered acceptable. A later updated pushed the range to {{convert|30000|-|60000|yd|km|abbr=on}} against a {{convert|600|kn|km/h|abbr=on}}, later {{convert|650|kn|km/h|abbr=on}}, target. It was assumed the targets would \"jink\" at 1G, so the missile needed to maneuver at 4G at sea level and 2.5G at 40,000&nbsp;ft. Additional requirements were the ability to switch between targets in 6 seconds.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=179}}\n\nThe designers ultimately selected a maximum range of 30,000&nbsp;yards, which included {{convert|6,000|yd|km|abbr=on}} of coasting after motor burn-out. This was about 50% better than the contemporary US [[RIM-2 Terrier|Terrier]] design. Hit probability was estimated to be 40% at maximum range, so salvos of three missiles would be fired at once, demanding a three-place launcher. This was later reduced back to a twin-launcher when it was realized accessing the missile in the middle launcher was difficult.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=179}}\n\n===Changing requirements===\nWhen the deployment of the Seaslug was first being considered, three classes of custom missile-firing ships were considered. The Task Force Ship would be capable of {{convert|30|kn|km/h|abbr=on}} and would tasked with fleet air defence. The Ocean Convoy Escort was a {{convert|17|kn|km/h|abbr=on}} vessel that would provide direct cover over seagoing convoys, while the {{convert|12|kn|km/h|abbr=on}} Coastal Convoy Escort would do the same closer to shore. At that time it was believed that [[aircraft carrier]]s would be able to provide adequate cover over convoys or fleets in the ocean, so attention turned to the Coastal Convoy Escort. Beginning in May 1953 a [[Beachy Head-class repair ship]] was converted into a prototype escort ship, {{HMS|Girdle Ness|}}, to test this fitting.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wise|first=Jon|title=RFA Girdle Ness: Sea Slug Missile Trials Ship|editor=John Jordan|publisher=Conway|location=London|year=2007|series=Warship 2007|pages=9\u201328|isbn=978-1-84486-041-8}}</ref>\n\nFor this role, the densest possible storage was required, so the initial design of a single booster rocket at the base end of the missile, as in most contemporary designs, was abandoned in favour of four smaller boosters wrapped around the fuselage, giving shorter overall length of about {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on}} without making the missile larger in diameter as the boosters fitted within the area of the guidance wings. If one of the boosters did not fire the thrust would be significantly off-axis, a possibility which was addressed by moving the boosters forward so their exhaust was near the centre of gravity of the missile, allowing the missile's small control surfaces to remain effective. In contrast, the American Terrier missile was somewhat shorter at {{convert|13|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}}, but this required an additional tandem booster which took the overall length to {{convert|28|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=179}}\n\nIn 1954, during another review of the Navy's future operations, consideration turned from a \"hot war\" against the Soviets to a series of \"warm wars\" in the [[third world]]. Among other changes brought about by this review, including the cancellation of a future all-gun cruiser class and ending further conversion of WWII-era destroyers to [[Type 15 frigate]]s, the new environment meant that air cover by carriers could not be guaranteed, and the need for air defence for task-force sized groups became the primary concern. A cut to carrier construction, capping the fleet at four, released funds for missile ship construction. In October 1954, a new design emerged that demanded the speed to keep up with a fleet in combat, have guns limited to self-defence, and carrying a single twin-missile launcher.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=181}}\n\nThe designs were continually modified in order to find a suitable arrangement. They started as early as 1953 with a mid-sized cruiser of {{convert|15000|LT|t|abbr=on}} carrying 60 to 90 missiles and a crew of 900. Admiral [[Ralph Edwards (Royal Navy officer)|Ralph Edwards]] pointed out it would be more useful to have a larger number of small ships with 10 to 20 missiles than one larger one, but attempts to design such a ship resulted in one with room for the weapons but not the crew needed to operate them. In May 1955 a wide variety of plans for designs between the two extremes were compared, ranging from 9,850 tons down to 4,550.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=182}} After continual comparison and revision, these plans finally gelled around what became the [[County-class destroyer]].{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=184}}\n\n===Testing===\nTest firings of the GAP-based examples, now known as Rocket Test Vehicle 1, or RTV.1, demonstrated beam riding in October 1956. The Navy had set a date of 1957 for a broad modernization of the fleet, so they desired Seaslug to be cleared for service in 1956. To this end, they accepted the use of liquid fuels in spite of the Navy's concerns with these fuels on ships. However, by 1956 a new [[solid fuel rocket]] had been developed by IMI Summerfield which provided the desired range.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=180}}\n\nContinual tests took place over the next four years using both the [[Clausen Rolling Platform]] at [[RAE Aberporth]] and the ''Girdle Ness''. A final series of tests at sea, which culminated in sixteen successful firings, finally cleared the missile for service in 1961.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=180}} After more than 250 launches, the Seaslug Mark 1, also known as Guided Weapon System 1, or GWS.1, finally entered service in 1962 on County-class, each fitted with a single twin missile launcher and a complete weapon system with one fire control set and 30 missiles. The Seaslug-armed cruisers were cancelled in 1957.{{sfn|Harding|2005|p=259}}\n\nSeaslug needed height, range and bearing information for targets. By 1955 the Royal Navy considered using the [[Type 984 radar]] on Seaslug-armed cruisers and destroyers to provide this. During development, the projected weight of the radar doubled, to the point where it could still potentially be mounted on cruisers, but was rejected for destroyers because it would have meant sacrificing their 4.5 in gun armament. The gun armament was regarded as essential for the navy's wider role outside the hot war mission. The solution adopted with the first batch of the County-class destroyers was to network them with ships carrying Type 984. The destroyers were given a reduced version of the [[Comprehensive Display System]] (CDS), which was fed by a [[Simplex communication|CDS-link receiver]] called DPD (Digital Picture Transmission or Translation).{{sfn|Harding|2005|p=259}}<ref name=Boslaugh66>{{cite book |title=When Computers Went to Sea: The Digitization of the United States Navy |first1= David L|last1=Boslaugh| page=66| url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Mi8MhzheOokC&q=Digital+Picture+Transmission+system#v=onepage&q=HMS%20Hermes&f=false|publisher=Matt Loeb|date=1999|isbn=0471472204}}</ref>\n\nThe final set for the County ships, actually more a cruiser type than a destroyer, was quite complex: a [[Type 965]] radar for early warning (P-band, 450 kW peak power, range over 175&nbsp;km), in the County Batch 2 the double antenna AKE-2 had two different frequency settings; a Type 992Q target indicator radar (3&nbsp;GHz, 1.75 MW peak power, 90&nbsp;km range); a Type 278 height finding set (80\u201390&nbsp;km); a Type 901 missile guidance radar (X band, 70&nbsp;km range), that in the Sea Slug Mk 2 had a continuous wave signal (but it was still a beam riding designation radar); a Type 904 fire control radar (used in the MRS-3 system, X-band, 50&nbsp;kW, 35&nbsp;km range) for surface targeting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.littlewars.org.uk/Seaslug/radar.html|title=Seaslug|publisher=SR Jenkins}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\nThe missile had four wrap-around booster motors that separated after launch. After separation, the main motor ignited to power the missile to the target. The booster motors were positioned at the side of the missile, but this unusual arrangement with the motor nozzles both angled outwards at 22.5\u00b0 and 22.5\u00b0 to the left, the missile entered a gentle roll at launch, evening out differences in the thrusts of the boosters. This meant that large stabilising fins as used on contemporary missiles in service with the [[Royal Air Force]] ([[Bristol Bloodhound]]) and the [[British Army]] ([[English Electric Thunderbird]]) were not required. Once the boosters were jettisoned the control surfaces became active.\n\nGuidance was by radar beam-riding, the beam to be provided by [[Type 901 radar|Type 901 fire-control radar]]. There were four flight modes:\n\n*LOSBR (Line Of Sight, Beam Riding), in which the missile flew up a beam that tracked the target\n*CASWTD (Constant Angle of Sight With Terminal Dive), with the missile climbing at a low angle and then diving onto a low-altitude target at 45\u00b0, used against low flying targets at over 12,000 yards away\n*MICAWBER (Missile In Constant Altitude While BEam Riding), used against low level target approaching at 500\u2013800 feet, it allows switching from CASWTD to LOSBR when the target is closing at the ship\n*Up and over: the standard surface attack mode, using the Type 901 radar slaved to the Type 903 in bearing; the missile is fired at high elevation and then depressed in order to strike the vessel with a steep dive, without arming the fuse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.littlewars.org.uk/Seaslug/slugmode.html|title=Seaslug|publisher=SR Jenkins}}</ref>\n\nElectrical power when the missile was in flight was provided by a [[flux switching alternator]] with a six tooth rotor.  \"The 1.5 kVA Seaslug generator ran at 24,000 rev/min with a frequency of 2,400 Hz.\"<ref>''Guided Weapons'', by Geoffrey Lee, et al, pub Brassey's, 3rd edition, 1998, {{ISBN|1-85753-152-3}}, p59.</ref>\n\n==Service performance==\nSeaslug was a high-performance weapon in the 1960s, with a single-shot kill probability of 92%, although other sources give lower kill probabilities: 75% for the Mk 1 and 65% for the Mk 2.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.littlewars.org.uk/Seaslug/seaslug03.html|title=Seaslug|publisher=SR Jenkins}}</ref> It was, however, limited by the complicated handling arrangements and since each County class ship carried only a single fire-control radar only one target could be engaged at once, though two missiles could be fired against it.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nThe cost of an individual Seaslug missile round in 1961 was approximately \u00a350,000.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nDuring the [[Falklands War]] Seaslug was only launched once against an aircraft target, by {{HMS|Antrim|D18|6}}, and did not hit. This is hardly surprising, as the Royal Navy considered the system to be obsolete and the low-level attacks experienced in the Falklands War were outside the missile's operational capacity. It was fired again in anger, this time against an Argentine radar at [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]] airfield that the [[Royal Air Force]] had been unable to destroy. During a shore bombardment {{HMS|Glamorgan|D19|6}} triangulated the last known position of the radar with her ESM and fired a Seaslug. She later fired several at the runway to cover it with debris which would have damaged any aircraft attempting to land or take off.  Results, if any, are unknown, but the spectacle of the launch sequence was something of a morale booster to the troops ashore.\n\nSeaslug was withdrawn as the County-class ships were decommissioned. {{HMS|Fife|D20|6}} was converted to a training ship, and had her Seaslug systems removed, freeing up large spaces for classrooms.\n\n==Variants==\n[[File:Sea Slug trials.jpg|thumb|The firing of the first Seaslug test missile from [[HMS Girdle Ness (A387)|HMS ''Girdle Ness'' (A387)]].

It had a radio [[proximity fuze]] and {{convert|200|lb|abbr=on}} blast warhead.\n\nThe Mark 1 was a [[beam-riding guidance|beam rider]] missile, meaning the target had to be continually illuminated by the directing radar, so the system was limited to engaging only the number of targets that there were radars to track and lock on.\n\n*Particulars\n**Attack Velocity: {{convert|685|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}\n**Range: {{convert|30000|yd|m}}\n**Ceiling: {{convert|55000|ft|m}}\n\n===Mark 2 (GWS.2)===\nThe Seaslug Mark 2 was based on the aborted [[List of Rainbow Codes|Blue Slug]] programme to develop an anti-ship missile using the Seaslug missile and guidance system. The project was cancelled in favour of the [[Green Cheese (missile)|\"Green Cheese\" missile]], a tactical nuclear anti-ship weapon,  but other project developments were incorporated into what became the Mark 2. It had improved low altitude performance and a limited anti-ship capability and entered service in 1971. The Mark 2 utilized an improved [[beam-riding guidance]] system.<!-- {{efn-lr|Another common error is that the Mark-2 has semi-active guidance; actually, it was the same beam-rider than Mark-1 }} --> and solid-state electronics. It was powered by the ''Deerhound'' sustainer motor, with ''Retriever'' boosters. Control was by a modified Type 901M radar and it had an improved infra-red proximity fuze and a [[continuous-rod warhead]] with a smaller, {{convert|56|lb|abbr=on}}, explosive charge (RDX-TNT) and an unfold diameter of about 70 feet (10&nbsp;mm steel rods were used) \n\n*Attack velocity: {{convert|1370|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}\n*Range: {{convert|35000|yd|km|abbr=on}}\n*Ceiling: {{convert|65000|ft|m|abbr=on}}\n\nThe capabilities of the new Sea Slug Mk 2, an almost 2.5 ton missile, were much improved compared to the previous Mk 1. The boosters gave a total of about 60 tons-force, with {{convert|186|kg|abbr=on}} fuel for each one (145 kg in the Mk 1), accelerating it to over Mach 2. When they separated because the extreme drag made by the rings all around the missile, the solid fuel sustainer ''Deerhound'' started to burn its {{convert|440|kg|abbr=on}} of propellant (390 kg for the Mk 1) and gave about {{convert|1,820|kg/s|abbr=on}} for 38 seconds. The slender missile remained at over Mach 2-2.5 until the flameout. The missile was made fully controllable about ten seconds after firing, followed by a radio-beacon while it was centered in the radar beam; and armed the proxy fuse (infra-red) at about {{convert|1|km|yd|abbr=on}} from the target, if 'hot', while if 'cold' the missile was detonated by command sent from the ship. \nThe range could be even more than 35,000 yards, especially at high altitude, with head-on supersonic targets. One of the longest shots recorded was made by HMS ''Antrim'' against a target over {{convert|58,000|yd|mi km|abbr=on}} away, with an impact at 34.500 with about 46 seconds flight time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.littlewars.org.uk/Seaslug/firings.html|title=Seaslug firing reports |work=Littlewars|publisher=S R Jenkins |date=27 September 2016}}</ref> The missile was capable to reach potentially aven higher altitude and longer range than nominally assested: even after the engine flameout (over 40 seconds after launch), it retained very high speeds, and one of them even surpassed {{convert|85,000|ft|abbr=on}} before being self-destructed, about one minute after the firing <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.littlewars.org.uk/Seaslug/whoops.html|title=Whoops -A firing that went slightly wrong! |date=6 June 2017 |work=Littlewars |publisher=S R Jenkins}}</ref>\n\nFor both Mark 1 and Mark 2 Sea Slug there were [[drill round]]s (painted blue) for the purpose of training and display rounds (painted red) which could be loaded onto the launcher for port visits and public relations.  \n\n\n===Nuclear variant (not built)===\nIn addition, a [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear-armed]] variant was planned using a low-yield [[Nuclear fission#Fission bombs|fission]] warhead code-named ''Winkle''. ''Winkle'' was never built as it was quickly supplanted by ''Pixie'', a very small [[Nuclear weapon design|unboosted]] warhead with an all-plutonium fissile core [[British nuclear tests at Maralinga|tested]] at [[Maralinga, South Australia|Maralinga]], which was, in turn, replaced by ''Gwen'' \u2014 a British version of\nthe US [[W54]] ''Gnat'' unboosted warhead of approximate yield 1/2 - 2 [[Kiloton]] (kt). The final warhead choice was ''Tony'' - a UK version of the [[W44]] ''[[Tsetse primary|Tsetse]]'' [[Boosted fission weapon|boosted]] warhead, but all nuclear options for Seaslug were subsequently abandoned, and no nuclear-armed variant of Seaslug was ever deployed.\n\n==Operators==\n[[File:Sea Slug operators.png|thumb|400px|Map with Seaslug operators in blue]]\n\n===Royal Navy===\nThe County-class destroyers were specifically built to carry Seaslug and its associated control equipment. The magazine was positioned amidships and missiles were assembled in a central gallery forward of the magazine before being passed to the launcher on the quarterdeck. The handling arrangements were designed with a nuclear-war environment in mind and were therefore entirely under cover.\n\n===Chilean Navy===\nSome of the County-class destroyers were sold to Chile for the [[Chilean Navy]].

Tracing its history as far back as 1943, it came into operational service in 1961 and was still in use at the time of the [[Falklands War]].\n\nSeaslug was intended to engage high-flying targets such as reconnaissance aircraft or bombers before they could launch stand-off weapons. It was only fitted to the Royal Navy's eight [[County-class destroyer]]s which were designed around the missile system.  Later improvements meant that it could also be used against ships. Seaslug was only fired in anger once as an anti-aircraft missile, from {{HMS|Antrim|D18|6}} during the Falklands War, but missed its target. It was also used for surface bombardment.\n\nSeaslug's medium-range role was to be supplanted by a very long-range missile known as [[Blue Envoy]], but this was passed over in favour of a new medium-range system, [[Sea Dart]]. Sea Dart entered service in 1973 on the [[Type 82 destroyer]]s and replaced Seaslug during the 1980s as the {{sclass2-|County|destroyer}}s were removed from service.\n\n==Development==\n===Initial concept===\nIn 1943, the German ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' began the use of [[anti-shipping missile]]s and guided bombs in the Mediterranean Ocean during Allied operations against Italy. These weapons were released outside of [[anti-aircraft gun]] range, which meant that any operations lacking complete [[air superiority]] would be open to attack with little response by the ships.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=197}} On 16 March 1944 the first meeting of the \"Guided Anti-Aircraft Projectile Committee\", or GAP Committee, was held.{{sfn|Grove|2004|p=193}}\n\nThe [[Admiralty Signals and Radar Establishment|Admiralty Signals Establishment]] (ASE), in charge of the Navy's [[radar]] development, was working on new radars featuring [[radar lock-on]] that allowed them to accurately track aircraft at long range. This was part of the LRS.1 fire-control system that allowed large dual-purpose guns to attack bombers at long range.{{sfn|Harding|2005|p=254}} A contemporary [[British Army]] project at Cossors, [[Brakemine]], was working on a system to allow a missile to keep itself centered within a radar beam, a concept known today as [[beam riding]]. The Navy decided to combine the two concepts, using the LRS.1's Type 909 radar with a new missile that differed from Brakemine primarily in requiring longer range and being more robust for shipborne use.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=197}}\n\nIn December 1944, GAP put out a Naval Staff Target for a new anti-aircraft weapon,{{sfn|Grove|2004|p=193}} capable of attacking targets at altitudes up to 50,000&nbsp;feet and speeds of up to {{convert|700|mph}}.{{sfn|Grove|2004|p=194}} This project was briefly known as LOPGAP, short for \"Liquid Oxygen and Petrol Guided Anti-aircraft Projectile\",{{sfn|Twigge|1993|p=246}} but soon moved from petrol to [[methanol]] which made the \"LOP\" inaccurate, and the name accordingly changed simply to GAP,{{sfn|Morton|1989|p=209}} and then Seaslug. Efforts to change the name to \"Triumph\" failed.{{sfn|Grove|2004|p=194}}\n\n===LOPGAP===\nThe [[Fairey Aviation Company]] was at this time working on a missile project for the Ministry of Supply, [[Fairey Stooge|Stooge]]. Stooge was more like an armed drone aircraft than a missile. It was flown to a location in front of the target and then cruised toward it until being triggered by the operator. Its low speed and manual guidance meant it was not useful for interceptions outside the immediate area of the ship, and thus did not meet the need for a longer-ranged weapon. Accordingly, Fairey was ordered to stop work on Stooge in favour of LOPGAP.{{efn-lr|Existing Stooge airframes continued to be test-fired for a time.}} Development was slowed by the [[Air Ministry]] who were opposed to the project as it might take resources away from jet fighter production{{efn|For unclear reasons, considering they were also working on several missile designs of their own.}} and a lack of urgency on the part of both the Admiralty and [[Ministry of Supply]].{{sfn|Grove|2004|p=194}}\n\nA March 1945 report called for the first test launches of LOPGAP from converted [[QF 3.7-inch AA gun|QF 3.7-inch air-aircraft gun]] mounts (the same were used for Stooge and Brakemine) within two months. They predicted the final system would be about {{convert|19|ft|abbr=on}} long and a twin-launcher would take up about the same room as a twin 5.25-inch gun turret. An April Staff Target called for the system to be able to engage an aircraft flying at {{convert|500|mph|abbr=on}} at altitudes up to {{convert|40,000|ft|abbr=on}} with a maximum weight of {{convert|500|lb|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=179}}\n\nIn a January 1947 Navy review, the program was given the name Seaslug. This called for a significantly larger weapon than initially envisioned in GAP, capable of single-stage vertical launch, a warhead (and guidance) of {{convert|200|lb|kg|abbr=on}} and an all-up weight of {{convert|1800|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Twigge|1993|p=28}} Development continued as before but was significantly hampered by the post-war exodus of engineering talent.{{sfn|Harding|2005|p=254}}\n\n===Move to RAE===\nIn 1945 a new Guided Projectiles Establishment was set up under the Controller of Supplies (Air) and in 1946 development of all ongoing missile projects moved to the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] (RAE) new Controlled Weapons Department, soon to become the Guided Weapons Department.{{sfn|Smith|1965|p=101}} They began considering the beam riding concept in partnership with the [[Telecommunications Research Establishment]] (TRE), the deliberately oddly-named department of the [[Air Ministry]] responsible for [[radar]] development. Over the next year, first Brakemine and then Stooge were moved to the RAE. Seaslug followed in 1947.{{sfn|Smith|1965|p=101}}\n\nDevelopment slowed further, and in July 1947 the Admiralty approached the [[Henry Tizard]] to see a more \"virile leadership\" of the program. Tizard called a meeting of the [[Defense Research Policy Committee]] (DRPC) and started a process of pushing through four key programs that were intended to enter service in 1957, Seaslug, a corresponding Army/Air Force missile known as [[Red Heathen (missile)|Red Heathen]], the [[Blue Boar (bomb)|Blue Boar]] [[television guidance]] [[glide bomb]], and the [[Red Hawk]] [[air-to-air missile]].{{sfn|Grove|2004|p=194}}\n\nIn March 1948 a new report from the DRPC noted there was not enough manpower for all four projects, and put Seaslug at the bottom of the priority list, claiming air attack would be less likely than submarine in the event of war. They suggested the much longer ranged Red Heathen was more important. The Admiralty was of another opinion on the matter.{{sfn|Grove|2004|p=194}}\n\nThe Navy found an unlikely ally in the Army, who were concerned that Red Heathen was too difficult to move to in a single stage and suggested that Seaslug might be the basis for a more immediate medium-range weapon that could be used both on land and sea. The DPRC also began to have concerns about guiding Red Heathen at its {{convert|100000|yd}} maximum range. In September 1948 they agreed to develop Seaslug \"as a matter of insurance\", before further upgrading it in 1949 to \"top priority\".{{sfn|Grove|2004|p=195}} As a result of these changes, the program was seen as having two stages, Stage 1 would deliver missiles in the mid-1950s with roughly {{convert|20|mi}} range with capability mostly against subsonic targets, and a Stage 2 of the early 1960s would have greatly extended range on the order of {{convert|150|mi}} and able to attack supersonic aircraft. \n\n===Experimental systems===\nTwo test systems emerged from this centralization. The CTV.1 was a small unpowered Brakemine-like system devoted to the development of the guidance systems, launched using three [[RP-3]] rocket motors and controlled through the coast phase. A series of CTV designs followed, providing ever-increasing amounts of [[telemetry]] for the guidance and control systems work.{{sfn|Smith|1965|pp=104-105}} GAP became a purely research-oriented system, RTV.1 (rocket test vehicle), as opposed to a prototype missile design, and was used primarily as a platform for testing the rocket motors.{{sfn|Smith|1965|p=105}}{{sfn|Twigge|1993|p=247}} The GAP/RTV.1 efforts would be directed at the Stage 1 design, which would essentially be the Seaslug requirement.\n\nThe relatively small CTV could safely be launched at the Larkhill Range, part of the [[Royal School of Artillery]]. It was equipped with a parachute that allowed it to be recovered. This was not possible for the much longer-ranged RTV, which was fired from [[ParcAberporth|RAF Aberporth]] out over [[Cardigan Bay]] in Wales. The desire to reclaim the RTVs as well led to the opening of a parallel launch facility at the [[RAAF Woomera Range Complex]] and a program that led development of supersonic parachutes.{{sfn|Smith|1965|p=106}}\n\nAs RTV testing continued, the decision was made to build a larger version, RTV.2, which would be more typical of a production missile. During early testing, the design was further modified and renamed GPV, for General Purpose Test Vehicle. Several [[liquid rocket]] motors were tested as part of this program. Early tests demonstrated shifts in the [[center of gravity]] that required active damping, which in turn led to the lengthening of the overall fuselage to become the \"long round\". This version used forward-mounted boosters, which were mounted so their exhaust was just in front of the mid-mounted wings.{{sfn|Smith|1965|p=108}}\n\n===Project 502===\nAs experimental work progressed, the Ministry of Supply began forming an industry team to build production systems. In 1949 this gave rise to the 'Project 502' group from industry, with [[Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft]] and [[Sperry Corporation#British Sperry|Sperry]] in March and [[General Electric Company|GEC]] in September.{{sfn|Twigge|1993|p=28}}\n\nThe 29 July 1949 update of the Staff Target called for a maximum range of {{convert|30000|yd|km|abbr=on}} and a minimum of {{convert|5000|yd|km|abbr=on}}. Maximum altitude should be 55,000&nbsp;ft, but 45,000 would be considered acceptable. A later updated pushed the range to {{convert|30000|-|60000|yd|km|abbr=on}} against a {{convert|600|kn|km/h|abbr=on}}, later {{convert|650|kn|km/h|abbr=on}}, target. It was assumed the targets would \"jink\" at 1G, so the missile needed to maneuver at 4G at sea level and 2.5G at 40,000&nbsp;ft. Additional requirements were the ability to switch between targets in 6 seconds.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=179}}\n\nThe designers ultimately selected a maximum range of 30,000&nbsp;yards, which included {{convert|6,000|yd|km|abbr=on}} of coasting after motor burn-out. This was about 50% better than the contemporary US [[RIM-2 Terrier|Terrier]] design. Hit probability was estimated to be 40% at maximum range, so salvos of three missiles would be fired at once, demanding a three-place launcher. This was later reduced back to a twin-launcher when it was realized accessing the missile in the middle launcher was difficult.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=179}}\n\n===Changing requirements===\nWhen the deployment of the Seaslug was first being considered, three classes of custom missile-firing ships were considered. The Task Force Ship would be capable of {{convert|30|kn|km/h|abbr=on}} and would tasked with fleet air defence. The Ocean Convoy Escort was a {{convert|17|kn|km/h|abbr=on}} vessel that would provide direct cover over seagoing convoys, while the {{convert|12|kn|km/h|abbr=on}} Coastal Convoy Escort would do the same closer to shore. At that time it was believed that [[aircraft carrier]]s would be able to provide adequate cover over convoys or fleets in the ocean, so attention turned to the Coastal Convoy Escort. Beginning in May 1953 a [[Beachy Head-class repair ship]] was converted into a prototype escort ship, {{HMS|Girdle Ness|}}, to test this fitting.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wise|first=Jon|title=RFA Girdle Ness: Sea Slug Missile Trials Ship|editor=John Jordan|publisher=Conway|location=London|year=2007|series=Warship 2007|pages=9\u201328|isbn=978-1-84486-041-8}}</ref>\n\nFor this role, the densest possible storage was required, so the initial design of a single booster rocket at the base end of the missile, as in most contemporary designs, was abandoned in favour of four smaller boosters wrapped around the fuselage, giving shorter overall length of about {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on}} without making the missile larger in diameter as the boosters fitted within the area of the guidance wings. If one of the boosters did not fire the thrust would be significantly off-axis, a possibility which was addressed by moving the boosters forward so their exhaust was near the centre of gravity of the missile, allowing the missile's small control surfaces to remain effective. In contrast, the American Terrier missile was somewhat shorter at {{convert|13|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}}, but this required an additional tandem booster which took the overall length to {{convert|28|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=179}}\n\nIn 1954, during another review of the Navy's future operations, consideration turned from a \"hot war\" against the Soviets to a series of \"warm wars\" in the [[third world]]. Among other changes brought about by this review, including the cancellation of a future all-gun cruiser class and ending further conversion of WWII-era destroyers to [[Type 15 frigate]]s, the new environment meant that air cover by carriers could not be guaranteed, and the need for air defence for task-force sized groups became the primary concern. A cut to carrier construction, capping the fleet at four, released funds for missile ship construction. In October 1954, a new design emerged that demanded the speed to keep up with a fleet in combat, have guns limited to self-defence, and carrying a single twin-missile launcher.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=181}}\n\nThe designs were continually modified in order to find a suitable arrangement. They started as early as 1953 with a mid-sized cruiser of {{convert|15000|LT|t|abbr=on}} carrying 60 to 90 missiles and a crew of 900. Admiral [[Ralph Edwards (Royal Navy officer)|Ralph Edwards]] pointed out it would be more useful to have a larger number of small ships with 10 to 20 missiles than one larger one, but attempts to design such a ship resulted in one with room for the weapons but not the crew needed to operate them. In May 1955 a wide variety of plans for designs between the two extremes were compared, ranging from 9,850 tons down to 4,550.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=182}} After continual comparison and revision, these plans finally gelled around what became the [[County-class destroyer]].{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=184}}\n\n===Testing===\nTest firings of the GAP-based examples, now known as Rocket Test Vehicle 1, or RTV.1, demonstrated beam riding in October 1956. The Navy had set a date of 1957 for a broad modernization of the fleet, so they desired Seaslug to be cleared for service in 1956. To this end, they accepted the use of liquid fuels in spite of the Navy's concerns with these fuels on ships. However, by 1956 a new [[solid fuel rocket]] had been developed by IMI Summerfield which provided the desired range.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=180}}\n\nContinual tests took place over the next four years using both the [[Clausen Rolling Platform]] at [[RAE Aberporth]] and the ''Girdle Ness''. A final series of tests at sea, which culminated in sixteen successful firings, finally cleared the missile for service in 1961.{{sfn|Friedman|2012|p=180}} After more than 250 launches, the Seaslug Mark 1, also known as Guided Weapon System 1, or GWS.1, finally entered service in 1962 on County-class, each fitted with a single twin missile launcher and a complete weapon system with one fire control set and 30 missiles. The Seaslug-armed cruisers were cancelled in 1957.{{sfn|Harding|2005|p=259}}\n\nSeaslug needed height, range and bearing information for targets. By 1955 the Royal Navy considered using the [[Type 984 radar]] on Seaslug-armed cruisers and destroyers to provide this. During development, the projected weight of the radar doubled, to the point where it could still potentially be mounted on cruisers, but was rejected for destroyers because it would have meant sacrificing their 4.5 in gun armament. The gun armament was regarded as essential for the navy's wider role outside the hot war mission. The solution adopted with the first batch of the County-class destroyers was to network them with ships carrying Type 984. The destroyers were given a reduced version of the [[Comprehensive Display System]] (CDS), which was fed by a [[Simplex communication|CDS-link receiver]] called DPD (Digital Picture Transmission or Translation).{{sfn|Harding|2005|p=259}}<ref name=Boslaugh66>{{cite book |title=When Computers Went to Sea: The Digitization of the United States Navy |first1= David L|last1=Boslaugh| page=66| url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Mi8MhzheOokC&q=Digital+Picture+Transmission+system#v=onepage&q=HMS%20Hermes&f=false|publisher=Matt Loeb|date=1999|isbn=0471472204}}</ref>\n\nThe final set for the County ships, actually more a cruiser type than a destroyer, was quite complex: a [[Type 965]] radar for early warning (P-band, 450 kW peak power, range over 175&nbsp;km), in the County Batch 2 the double antenna AKE-2 had two different frequency settings; a Type 992Q target indicator radar (3&nbsp;GHz, 1.75 MW peak power, 90&nbsp;km range); a Type 278 height finding set (80\u201390&nbsp;km); a Type 901 missile guidance radar (X band, 70&nbsp;km range), that in the Sea Slug Mk 2 had a continuous wave signal (but it was still a beam riding designation radar); a Type 904 fire control radar (used in the MRS-3 system, X-band, 50&nbsp;kW, 35&nbsp;km range) for surface targeting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.littlewars.org.uk/Seaslug/radar.html|title=Seaslug|publisher=SR Jenkins}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\nThe missile had four wrap-around booster motors that separated after launch. After separation, the main motor ignited to power the missile to the target. The booster motors were positioned at the side of the missile, but this unusual arrangement with the motor nozzles both angled outwards at 22.5\u00b0 and 22.5\u00b0 to the left, the missile entered a gentle roll at launch, evening out differences in the thrusts of the boosters. This meant that large stabilising fins as used on contemporary missiles in service with the [[Royal Air Force]] ([[Bristol Bloodhound]]) and the [[British Army]] ([[English Electric Thunderbird]]) were not required. Once the boosters were jettisoned the control surfaces became active.\n\nGuidance was by radar beam-riding, the beam to be provided by [[Type 901 radar|Type 901 fire-control radar]]. There were four flight modes:\n\n*LOSBR (Line Of Sight, Beam Riding), in which the missile flew up a beam that tracked the target\n*CASWTD (Constant Angle of Sight With Terminal Dive), with the missile climbing at a low angle and then diving onto a low-altitude target at 45\u00b0, used against low flying targets at over 12,000 yards away\n*MICAWBER (Missile In Constant Altitude While BEam Riding), used against low level target approaching at 500\u2013800 feet, it allows switching from CASWTD to LOSBR when the target is closing at the ship\n*Up and over: the standard surface attack mode, using the Type 901 radar slaved to the Type 903 in bearing; the missile is fired at high elevation and then depressed in order to strike the vessel with a steep dive, without arming the fuse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.littlewars.org.uk/Seaslug/slugmode.html|title=Seaslug|publisher=SR Jenkins}}</ref>\n\nElectrical power when the missile was in flight was provided by a [[flux switching alternator]] with a six tooth rotor.  \"The 1.5 kVA Seaslug generator ran at 24,000 rev/min with a frequency of 2,400 Hz.\"<ref>''Guided Weapons'', by Geoffrey Lee, et al, pub Brassey's, 3rd edition, 1998, {{ISBN|1-85753-152-3}}, p59.</ref>\n\n==Service performance==\nSeaslug was a high-performance weapon in the 1960s, with a single-shot kill probability of 92%, although other sources give lower kill probabilities: 75% for the Mk 1 and 65% for the Mk 2.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.littlewars.org.uk/Seaslug/seaslug03.html|title=Seaslug|publisher=SR Jenkins}}</ref> It was, however, limited by the complicated handling arrangements and since each County class ship carried only a single fire-control radar only one target could be engaged at once, though two missiles could be fired against it.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nThe cost of an individual Seaslug missile round in 1961 was approximately \u00a350,000.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nDuring the [[Falklands War]] Seaslug was only launched once against an aircraft target, by {{HMS|Antrim|D18|6}}, and did not hit. This is hardly surprising, as the Royal Navy considered the system to be obsolete and the low-level attacks experienced in the Falklands War were outside the missile's operational capacity. It was fired again in anger, this time against an Argentine radar at [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]] airfield that the [[Royal Air Force]] had been unable to destroy. During a shore bombardment {{HMS|Glamorgan|D19|6}} triangulated the last known position of the radar with her ESM and fired a Seaslug. She later fired several at the runway to cover it with debris which would have damaged any aircraft attempting to land or take off.  Results, if any, are unknown, but the spectacle of the launch sequence was something of a morale booster to the troops ashore.\n\nSeaslug was withdrawn as the County-class ships were decommissioned. {{HMS|Fife|D20|6}} was converted to a training ship, and had her Seaslug systems removed, freeing up large spaces for classrooms.\n\n==Variants==\n[[File:Sea Slug trials.jpg|thumb|The firing of the first Seaslug test missile from [[HMS Girdle Ness (A387)|HMS ''Girdle Ness'' (A387)]]. This version is based on the RAE's early GPV, and retains the rear-mounted boosters before they moved forward on the \"long round\".]]\nThere were two main variants of the Seaslug:\n\n===Mark 1 (GWS.1)===\nThe Seaslug Mark 1 was powered by the solid-fuel ''Foxhound'' (390&nbsp;kg fuel) sustainer motor{{efn-lr|There is a common error about a liquid-fuel sustainer on this model.}} and ''Gosling''(145&nbsp;kg) booster motors. It had a radio [[proximity fuze]] and {{convert|200|lb|abbr=on}} blast warhead.\n\nThe Mark 1 was a [[beam-riding guidance|beam rider]] missile, meaning the target had to be continually illuminated by the directing radar, so the system was limited to engaging only the number of targets that there were radars to track and lock on.\n\n*Particulars\n**Attack Velocity: {{convert|685|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}\n**Range: {{convert|30000|yd|m}}\n**Ceiling: {{convert|55000|ft|m}}\n\n===Mark 2 (GWS.2)===\nThe Seaslug Mark 2 was based on the aborted [[List of Rainbow Codes|Blue Slug]] programme to develop an anti-ship missile using the Seaslug missile and guidance system. The project was cancelled in favour of the [[Green Cheese (missile)|\"Green Cheese\" missile]], a tactical nuclear anti-ship weapon,  but other project developments were incorporated into what became the Mark 2. It had improved low altitude performance and a limited anti-ship capability and entered service in 1971. The Mark 2 utilized an improved [[beam-riding guidance]] system.<!-- {{efn-lr|Another common error is that the Mark-2 has semi-active guidance; actually, it was the same beam-rider than Mark-1 }} --> and solid-state electronics. It was powered by the ''Deerhound'' sustainer motor, with ''Retriever'' boosters. Control was by a modified Type 901M radar and it had an improved infra-red proximity fuze and a [[continuous-rod warhead]] with a smaller, {{convert|56|lb|abbr=on}}, explosive charge (RDX-TNT) and an unfold diameter of about 70 feet (10&nbsp;mm steel rods were used) \n\n*Attack velocity: {{convert|1370|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}\n*Range: {{convert|35000|yd|km|abbr=on}}\n*Ceiling: {{convert|65000|ft|m|abbr=on}}\n\nThe capabilities of the new Sea Slug Mk 2, an almost 2.5 ton missile, were much improved compared to the previous Mk 1. The boosters gave a total of about 60 tons-force, with {{convert|186|kg|abbr=on}} fuel for each one (145 kg in the Mk 1), accelerating it to over Mach 2. When they separated because the extreme drag made by the rings all around the missile, the solid fuel sustainer ''Deerhound'' started to burn its {{convert|440|kg|abbr=on}} of propellant (390 kg for the Mk 1) and gave about {{convert|1,820|kg/s|abbr=on}} for 38 seconds. The slender missile remained at over Mach 2-2.5 until the flameout. The missile was made fully controllable about ten seconds after firing, followed by a radio-beacon while it was centered in the radar beam; and armed the proxy fuse (infra-red) at about {{convert|1|km|yd|abbr=on}} from the target, if 'hot', while if 'cold' the missile was detonated by command sent from the ship. \nThe range could be even more than 35,000 yards, especially at high altitude, with head-on supersonic targets. One of the longest shots recorded was made by HMS ''Antrim'' against a target over {{convert|58,000|yd|mi km|abbr=on}} away, with an impact at 34.500 with about 46 seconds flight time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.littlewars.org.uk/Seaslug/firings.html|title=Seaslug firing reports |work=Littlewars|publisher=S R Jenkins |date=27 September 2016}}</ref> The missile was capable to reach potentially aven higher altitude and longer range than nominally assested: even after the engine flameout (over 40 seconds after launch), it retained very high speeds, and one of them even surpassed {{convert|85,000|ft|abbr=on}} before being self-destructed, about one minute after the firing <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.littlewars.org.uk/Seaslug/whoops.html|title=Whoops -A firing that went slightly wrong! |date=6 June 2017 |work=Littlewars |publisher=S R Jenkins}}</ref>\n\nFor both Mark 1 and Mark 2 Sea Slug there were [[drill round]]s (painted blue) for the purpose of training and display rounds (painted red) which could be loaded onto the launcher for port visits and public relations.  \n\n\n===Nuclear variant (not built)===\nIn addition, a [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear-armed]] variant was planned using a low-yield [[Nuclear fission#Fission bombs|fission]] warhead code-named ''Winkle''. ''Winkle'' was never built as it was quickly supplanted by ''Pixie'', a very small [[Nuclear weapon design|unboosted]] warhead with an all-plutonium fissile core [[British nuclear tests at Maralinga|tested]] at [[Maralinga, South Australia|Maralinga]], which was, in turn, replaced by ''Gwen'' \u2014 a British version of\nthe US [[W54]] ''Gnat'' unboosted warhead of approximate yield 1/2 - 2 [[Kiloton]] (kt). The final warhead choice was ''Tony'' - a UK version of the [[W44]] ''[[Tsetse primary|Tsetse]]'' [[Boosted fission weapon|boosted]] warhead, but all nuclear options for Seaslug were subsequently abandoned, and no nuclear-armed variant of Seaslug was ever deployed.\n\n==Operators==\n[[File:Sea Slug operators.png|thumb|400px|Map with Seaslug operators in blue]]\n\n===Royal Navy===\nThe County-class destroyers were specifically built to carry Seaslug and its associated control equipment. The magazine was positioned amidships and missiles were assembled in a central gallery forward of the magazine before being passed to the launcher on the quarterdeck. The handling arrangements were designed with a nuclear-war environment in mind and were therefore entirely under cover.\n\n===Chilean Navy===\nSome of the County-class destroyers were sold to Chile for the [[Chilean Navy]].
