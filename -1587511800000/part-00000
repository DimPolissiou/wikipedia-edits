States uniformly set 21 as the voting age, although Connecticut debated lowering it to 18 in 1819. In general young Americans were expected to be deferential to their elders, and John Adams famously cautioned that expanding suffrage would encourage \u201clads from twelve to twenty-one\u201d to demand the right to vote. <ref> Adams, John, The Works of John Adams, Second President of the United States, vol. 9, Ed. quoted in Charles Francis Adams (Boston, 1856), 378.</ref>\n\nYet as the suffrage expanded to non-property-holders in the early 1800s, young people came to play a larger role in politics. During the rise of Jacksonian Democracy, youths often organized Young Men\u2019s clubs in support of the Democratic, National Republican, Whig, or Anti-Masonic parties. <ref> Grinspan, Jon. (2016) The Virgin Vote: How Young Americans Made Democracy Social, Politics Personal, and Voting Popular in the Nineteenth Century, (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press)</ref> Presidential campaigns often organized torch-lit rallies of thousands of marchers, and analyses of these club rosters show that members were often in their late teens and early twenties. <ref> Grinspan, Jon. (2009) \u201c\u2018Young Men for War\u2019: The Wide Awakes and Lincoln\u2019s 1860 Presidential Campaign.\u201d Journal of American History 96, 367.</ref> The demands of popular democracy \u2013 which often drew voter turnouts above 80% of eligible voters \u2013 led political machines to rely on youths as cheap, enthusiastic campaigners for political machines. In 1848, Abraham Lincoln suggested that Whig Party in Springfield, Illinois, make use of \u201cthe shrewd, wild boys about town, whether just of age or a little under age.\u201d <ref>Lincoln Abraham, June 22, 1848, Abraham Lincoln: The Collected Works, Eight Volumes, Ed. Roy P. Basler, (New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 1953), 1: 491.</ref>\n\nIn the mid-to-late 1800s, young men enthusiastically cast their \u201cvirgin vote\u201d when turning 21. Voting was often seen as a rite of passage and public declaration of manhood, adulthood, and citizenship. Young African-Americans participated in voting and campaigning where they could vote, and young women, though prevented from voting themselves, followed politics closely, read partisan newspapers, and argued politics with the young men in their lives. <ref>Grinspan, Jon. (2016) The Virgin Vote.</ref>\n\nAround the turn of the 20th century, political reformers reduced party\u2019s reliance on young activists in an effort to clean up politics. Youth turnout fell shortly thereafter, especially among first time \u201cvirgin voters,\u201d whose turnout declined 53% between 1888 and 1924. <ref>Kleppner, Paul. (1982), Who Voted? The Dynamics of Electoral Turnout, 1870-1980, (New York: Praeger, 1982), 68-9</ref> As turnout fell in the early 20th century, young people played less role in campaigning. Though individual campaigns, like those of Theodore Roosevelt in 1904, Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1932, and John F. Kennedy in 1960, specifically appealed to youth, political parties generally showed less systematic interest in the youth vote.\n\nBy the late 1960s and early 1970s, young people demanded more of a role in American public life, eventually leading to the passage of the 26th amendment, lowering the voting age to 18 in 1971. Even after the passage of this amendment, voter turnout among 18-24 year olds fell throughout the 1970s, \u201880s, and \u201890s, although there seems to have been a resurgence in the last generation.\n\n==Variables affecting the youth vote in the United States==\n{{coatrack|date=June 2015|details=Many of these subsections contain information of a general nature, without many details on how the youth vote specifically is affected}}\nThe lack of youth participation in the voting process is not a random phenomenon. There are multiple variables that have an influence on the voting behaviors of youth in the United States.\n\n===Voting process===\nThe voting process has two steps.  An eligible voter - a U.S. citizen over the age of 18<ref name=\"Register to Vote\">{{cite web|title=Register to Vote|url=http://www.usa.gov/Citizen/Topics/Voting/Register.shtml|website=USA.gov|publisher=U.S. Government|accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref> - must first register to vote and then commit the act of voting.  The voting process is regulated by each state individually and therefore varies from state to state.<ref name=\"WH Elections\">{{cite web|title=Elections and Voting|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/our-government/elections-and-voting|website=The White House|accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref>\nThe process of registering to vote is different depending on the state.<ref name=\"WH Elections\"/>  Pre-registration is available to youth under the age of 18 in 20 states and Washington D.C.<ref name=\"NCSL Pre-Reg\">{{cite web|title=Pre-registration for Young Voters|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/preregistration-for-young-voters.aspx|website=National Conference of State Legislatures|accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref> Potential voters may also register on Election Day - or on the day on which they vote early - in 10 states and Washington D.C.<ref name=\"NCSL - SD Reg\">{{cite web|title=Same Day Voter Registration|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/same-day-registration.aspx|website=National Conference of State Legislatures|accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref>  This may be done at the polling place or at an election official's office.<ref name=\"NCSL - SD Reg\"/>  Residents of the 40 states which do not allow same day registration require potential voters to register by a deadline, typically from eight to 30 days  out from the election.<ref name=\"NCSL - SD Reg\"/>  Over half of the states in the U.S. offer some sort or online voter registration.<ref name=\"NCSL - Web VR\">{{cite web|title=Online Voter Registration|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/electronic-or-online-voter-registration.aspx|website=National Conference of State Legislatures|accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref>  This consists of the same process as a paper registration form, only it is digital on the internet and send to election officials to review over the web.  This process was first introduced in Arizona in 2002.<ref name=\"NCSL - Web VR\"/> \nThere are different regulations on the time and avenue through which a citizen can vote.  Early voting is available in 33 states and Washington D.C.  This must be done in person at a designated polling place.  Early voting period lengths vary from state to state.<ref name=\"NCSL Voting\">{{cite web|title=Absentee and Early Voting|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/absentee-and-early-voting.aspx|website=The National Conference of State Legislatures|accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref>  If a potential voter is not able to vote in person on Election Day or during the early voting period, they may request an absentee ballot.  In 20 states, an excuse must be filed to receive the absentee ballot.<ref name=\"NCSL Voting\" /> In 27 states and Washington D.C., a voter may acquire an absentee ballot without an excuse.  In Washington, Oregon and Colorado all voting is done through the mail.  A ballot is mailed to the voters residence and after the voter fills it out, he/she may mail it back.  No in person polls are conducted.<ref name=\"NCSL Voting\" /> Otherwise, the typical voting period is twelve hours on a weekday at which time voters must go to the polls in person and cast their votes.\n\n===Two party system===\nThe winner-take-all system in the United States limits the success of [[Third party (United States)|third party]] candidates who may have a difficult time achieving an electoral majority.<ref name=OC />  Young people are increasingly supporting third party candidates, though the American political system has continued to foster a [[two-party system]].  In 1992, [[Ross Perot]], a third party candidate for president, won 22 percent of the eighteen-to-twenty-four-year-old vote, his strongest performance among any demographic group\".<ref name=OC />  These third party candidates who gain such support from the youth of the U.S. do not benefit from major party coffers - they must campaign by themselves.\n\n===Money in politics===\n\nIn nine out of ten elections, the candidate who spends the most money is elected.<ref name=OC /> The average cost of a successful campaign for the [[United States House of Representatives]] is nearly half a million dollars.<ref name=OC />  A large portion of this money comes from \"large individual contributions\" \u2013 an average of 74 percent of the campaign funds raised in the 2012 presidential election between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney were large individual contributions. An average of 25 percent of presidential campaign funds in 2012 were made in \"small individual contributions.\"<ref name=OS>{{cite web|title=Source of Funds|url=https://www.opensecrets.org/pres12/sourceall.php|website=OpenSecrets.org|publisher=Center for Responsive Politics|accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref>  The Supreme Court rulings on Citizens United v.

As youth change residences often, the local issues and elections relevant to the area may not affect the youth yet or be significant and change from residence to residence.<ref name=OC /> College students face the decision whether to stay registered in their hometowns or to register in the community in which they will reside.<ref name=OC /> The fewer federal tax obligations that apply to youth ages 18\u201324 only loosely tie them to the government and policy making decisions and do not entice youth to vote and make a change.<ref name=OC />\n\n===Lack of candidate contact===\n\nYoung people complain that those in politics do not communicate with them.<ref name=OC />  Political candidates and their campaigns know, through past election data, that youth are not a reliable voting group and choose to spend their campaign dollars on those who are more likely to turn out to vote.  For this reason, candidates tend to focus on issues that pertain to their targeted voters to gain their support, further discouraging youth voters.  The discouraged youth complete the cycle of neglect by not turning out to vote, proving to candidates that the youth are not a reliable voting group.<ref name=\"YV 2004\" />  \"Elected officials respond to the preferences of voters, not non-voters,\" therefore ignoring the youth of America who do not turn out to vote.<ref name=\"Tech and Poli\" />\n\n===Volunteering efforts===\n\nThough many consider voting a civic activity, youth today seem to have separated the political from the civic.<ref name=\"YV 2004\" />  Youth often participate in volunteer opportunities, fundraisers and other activist activities.  In this way, youth can make a difference in their communities and are able to see change immediately when seeing the larger picture of a movement, including the political aspect, may be more difficult or intangible.<ref name=OC />\n\n==Efforts to encourage youth vote==\n\n===Organizations===\nA variety of organizations worked to encourage young people to vote.<ref name=CNN18>{{cite news|first1=Hunter|last1=Schwarz|accessdate=2018-10-07|title=Voter registration is so hot right now|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/09/25/politics/voter-registration-day-millennials-midterms/index.html|newspaper=CNN}}</ref> [[Rock the Vote]], a platform used by grassroots campaigns,<ref name=\"YV 2004\" /><ref name=OC /><ref name=CNN18/> by 2018 had registered over 7 million votes and gained over 350 partners directing people to its online registration tool.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rockthevote.org/resources/online-voter-registration-tool/|title=Online Voter Registration Platform|access-date=2018-10-07}}</ref>\n\nEfforts before the 1970s include:\n* [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]]\n*[[Black Panthers]]\n* [[Young Lords]]\n*[[Youth Liberation of Ann Arbor]]\n\nLater efforts include:\n* [[18 in '08]]\n*[https://www.18by.vote/ 18by.Vote]\n* Bus Federation Civic Fund\n* Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE) \n* [[College Republicans]] and [[College Democrats of America]] all over country\n* [[Declare Yourself]]<ref name=\"YV 2004\" />\n* HeadCount, picked by the [[Ad Council]] in 2018 for a spot to be seen by 10 million\n* Hip Hop Summit Action Network<ref name=\"YV 2004\" />\n* Inspire U.S.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.inspire-usa.org | title=Inspire U.S}}</ref>\n* [[League of Young Voters]] \n* MTV<ref name=\"YV 2004\" />\n* [[National Stonewall Democrats]]<ref name=\"YV 2004\" />\n* New Voters Project<ref name=\"YV 2004\" />\n* [[New York Public Interest Research Group]] (NYPIRG)\n* [[Sean Combs]]'s \"Vote or Die\" campaign<ref name=\"YV 2004\" />\n* Spitfire Strategies<ref name=\"YV 2004\" />\n* [[Our Time (nonprofit)|Our Time]] \n* TurboVote.org (with Snapchat and others)<ref>{{cite news|date=2018-10-24|title=Snapchat Helped Register Over 400,000 Voters|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/23/technology/snapchat-voter-registration-midterms.html}}</ref>\n* [[When We All Vote]], co-chaired by [[Michelle Obama]]<ref name=CNN18/>\n* World Wrestling Entertainment's Smackdown Your Vote<ref name=\"YV 2004\" />\n* Young Greens Caucus\n* Young Voter PAC \n* Young Voter's Alliance<ref name=\"YV 2004\" />\n* YouthVote USA\n\n===Campaign strategies===\n\nBecause the youth population is so large, many campaigns try to gain their support during elections.<ref name=\"YV 2004\" /> Efforts to capture the youth vote include [[Voter registration campaign|registration drives]], outreach and specifically youth-friendly policy platforms.  An example of a fairly successful voter registration drive would be the \"Reggie the Rig\" drive by the [[Republican National Committee]] in the 2004 election.  With a goal of registering three million new voters, the \"Reggie the Rig\" bus travelled to college campuses, a place to reach thousands of youth at once.<ref name=\"YV 2004\" />  During the same election, the Democrats held their own campus visits, but instead of focusing on registration, the Kerry campaign spread the word about their youth policy platform called Compact with the Next Generation.<ref name=\"YV 2004\" />  The Democrats also placed targeted ads on TV during shows such as ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and ''[[The Daily Show]]'' with Jon Stewart.<ref name=\"YV 2004\" />  This targeted campaign on TV has often been supplemented with outreach through the internet in modern campaigns.  New technology, the internet especially, is making it easier for candidates to reach the youth.  It has been found that \"young people who encounter campaign information on their own accord and spend time interacting with political material may come to see themselves interested in politics.\"<ref name=\"Tech and Poli\" />\n\nYoung adults are \"over-represented among all computer and Internet users\" \u2013 three fourths of Americans under the age of 18 are able to access a computer and, on average, use it for half an hour a day.<ref name=\"Tech and Poli\" />   As the Internet and computers have become more accessible to youth, such methods have been used to seek and find information and share it on social media cites. Websites such as [[Facebook]] and [[YouTube]] not only allow youth who don't subscribe to newspapers or watch the evening news to stay on top of the polls, but also allows them to share their opinions of the polls and candidates.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Von Drehle, David. \"Why Young Voters Care Again.\" Time Magazine. Feb 2008:34-48</ref>  If the use of technology were to be fully integrated into politics, the youth and adult groups would be equally active in politics.<ref name=\"Tech and Poli\" />\nOnline news media, in particular, is believed to have a positive impact on young citizens due to its interactivity.<ref name=\"journals.sagepub.com\">{{Cite journal | doi=10.1177/0267323112465369|title = Age and the effects of news media attention and social media use on political interest and participation: Do social media function as leveller?| journal=European Journal of Communication| volume=28| pages=19\u201334|year = 2013|last1 = Holt|first1 = Kristoffer| last2=Shehata| first2=Adam| last3=Str\u00f6mb\u00e4ck| first3=Jesper| last4=Ljungberg| first4=Elisabet}}</ref>\nIt not only provides them with the information they need to form their political beliefs and to become more informed regarding democracy and to gain a better understanding of current issues. But, it also provides them with a platform to discuss these ideas with other individuals, not only on a more localized scale but also on a global scale.<ref name=\"journals.sagepub.com\"/>\n\n===Legislation===\n\nIn the United States, there has been legislation passed that helped youth access the vote.  The [[National Voter Registration Act]] (NVRA), often called the \"motor-voter\" law, passed in 1993, allows those 18 years and older to register to vote at a driver's license office or public assistance agency.<ref name=OC />  The law also required states to accept a uniform mail-in voter registration application.<ref name=OC />  Additionally, some states have extended the period in which citizens can vote instead of requiring a vote within 12 hours on a single day.<ref name=OC />\n\nTwo cities in [[Maryland]], [[Takoma Park]] and [[Hyattsville]] allow 16 and 17-year-olds to vote in local elections.<ref>[http://vote16usa.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Resources.Fact-Sheet.pdf]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Youth politics]]\n*[[Youth suffrage]]\n*[[Young Voters for the President]]\n*[[Apathy is Boring]], a Canadian non-profit and non-partisan organization that promotes youth involvement in politics\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n* John B.

(2009) \u201c\u2018Young Men for War\u2019: The Wide Awakes and Lincoln\u2019s 1860 Presidential Campaign.\u201d Journal of American History 96, 367.</ref> The demands of popular democracy \u2013 which often drew voter turnouts above 80% of eligible voters \u2013 led political machines to rely on youths as cheap, enthusiastic campaigners for political machines. In 1848, Abraham Lincoln suggested that Whig Party in Springfield, Illinois, make use of \u201cthe shrewd, wild boys about town, whether just of age or a little under age.\u201d <ref>Lincoln Abraham, June 22, 1848, Abraham Lincoln: The Collected Works, Eight Volumes, Ed. Roy P. Basler, (New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 1953), 1: 491.</ref>\n\nIn the mid-to-late 1800s, young men enthusiastically cast their \u201cvirgin vote\u201d when turning 21. Voting was often seen as a rite of passage and public declaration of manhood, adulthood, and citizenship. Young African-Americans participated in voting and campaigning where they could vote, and young women, though prevented from voting themselves, followed politics closely, read partisan newspapers, and argued politics with the young men in their lives. <ref>Grinspan, Jon. (2016) The Virgin Vote.</ref>\n\nAround the turn of the 20th century, political reformers reduced party\u2019s reliance on young activists in an effort to clean up politics. Youth turnout fell shortly thereafter, especially among first time \u201cvirgin voters,\u201d whose turnout declined 53% between 1888 and 1924. <ref>Kleppner, Paul. (1982), Who Voted? The Dynamics of Electoral Turnout, 1870-1980, (New York: Praeger, 1982), 68-9</ref> As turnout fell in the early 20th century, young people played less role in campaigning. Though individual campaigns, like those of Theodore Roosevelt in 1904, Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1932, and John F. Kennedy in 1960, specifically appealed to youth, political parties generally showed less systematic interest in the youth vote.\n\nBy the late 1960s and early 1970s, young people demanded more of a role in American public life, eventually leading to the passage of the 26th amendment, lowering the voting age to 18 in 1971. Even after the passage of this amendment, voter turnout among 18-24 year olds fell throughout the 1970s, \u201880s, and \u201890s, although there seems to have been a resurgence in the last generation.\n\n==Variables affecting the youth vote in the United States==\n{{coatrack|date=June 2015|details=Many of these subsections contain information of a general nature, without many details on how the youth vote specifically is affected}}\nThe lack of youth participation in the voting process is not a random phenomenon. There are multiple variables that have an influence on the voting behaviors of youth in the United States.\n\n===Voting process===\nThe voting process has two steps.  An eligible voter - a U.S. citizen over the age of 18<ref name=\"Register to Vote\">{{cite web|title=Register to Vote|url=http://www.usa.gov/Citizen/Topics/Voting/Register.shtml|website=USA.gov|publisher=U.S. Government|accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref> - must first register to vote and then commit the act of voting.

This process was first introduced in Arizona in 2002.<ref name=\"NCSL - Web VR\"/> \nThere are different regulations on the time and avenue through which a citizen can vote.  Early voting is available in 33 states and Washington D.C.  This must be done in person at a designated polling place.  Early voting period lengths vary from state to state.<ref name=\"NCSL Voting\">{{cite web|title=Absentee and Early Voting|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/absentee-and-early-voting.aspx|website=The National Conference of State Legislatures|accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref>  If a potential voter is not able to vote in person on Election Day or during the early voting period, they may request an absentee ballot.  In 20 states, an excuse must be filed to receive the absentee ballot.<ref name=\"NCSL Voting\" /> In 27 states and Washington D.C., a voter may acquire an absentee ballot without an excuse.  In Washington, Oregon and Colorado all voting is done through the mail.  A ballot is mailed to the voters residence and after the voter fills it out, he/she may mail it back.  No in person polls are conducted.<ref name=\"NCSL Voting\" /> Otherwise, the typical voting period is twelve hours on a weekday at which time voters must go to the polls in person and cast their votes.\n\n===Two party system===\nThe winner-take-all system in the United States limits the success of [[Third party (United States)|third party]] candidates who may have a difficult time achieving an electoral majority.<ref name=OC />  Young people are increasingly supporting third party candidates, though the American political system has continued to foster a [[two-party system]].  In 1992, [[Ross Perot]], a third party candidate for president, won 22 percent of the eighteen-to-twenty-four-year-old vote, his strongest performance among any demographic group\".<ref name=OC />  These third party candidates who gain such support from the youth of the U.S. do not benefit from major party coffers - they must campaign by themselves.\n\n===Money in politics===\n\nIn nine out of ten elections, the candidate who spends the most money is elected.<ref name=OC /> The average cost of a successful campaign for the [[United States House of Representatives]] is nearly half a million dollars.<ref name=OC />  A large portion of this money comes from \"large individual contributions\" \u2013 an average of 74 percent of the campaign funds raised in the 2012 presidential election between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney were large individual contributions. An average of 25 percent of presidential campaign funds in 2012 were made in \"small individual contributions.\"<ref name=OS>{{cite web|title=Source of Funds|url=https://www.opensecrets.org/pres12/sourceall.php|website=OpenSecrets.org|publisher=Center for Responsive Politics|accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref>  The Supreme Court rulings on Citizens United v.

As youth change residences often, the local issues and elections relevant to the area may not affect the youth yet or be significant and change from residence to residence.<ref name=OC /> College students face the decision whether to stay registered in their hometowns or to register in the community in which they will reside.<ref name=OC /> The fewer federal tax obligations that apply to youth ages 18\u201324 only loosely tie them to the government and policy making decisions and do not entice youth to vote and make a change.<ref name=OC />\n\n===Lack of candidate contact===\n\nYoung people complain that those in politics do not communicate with them.<ref name=OC />  Political candidates and their campaigns know, through past election data, that youth are not a reliable voting group and choose to spend their campaign dollars on those who are more likely to turn out to vote.  For this reason, candidates tend to focus on issues that pertain to their targeted voters to gain their support, further discouraging youth voters.  The discouraged youth complete the cycle of neglect by not turning out to vote, proving to candidates that the youth are not a reliable voting group.<ref name=\"YV 2004\" />  \"Elected officials respond to the preferences of voters, not non-voters,\" therefore ignoring the youth of America who do not turn out to vote.<ref name=\"Tech and Poli\" />\n\n===Volunteering efforts===\n\nThough many consider voting a civic activity, youth today seem to have separated the political from the civic.<ref name=\"YV 2004\" />  Youth often participate in volunteer opportunities, fundraisers and other activist activities.  In this way, youth can make a difference in their communities and are able to see change immediately when seeing the larger picture of a movement, including the political aspect, may be more difficult or intangible.<ref name=OC />\n\n==Efforts to encourage youth vote==\n\n===Organizations===\nA variety of organizations worked to encourage young people to vote.<ref name=CNN18>{{cite news|first1=Hunter|last1=Schwarz|accessdate=2018-10-07|title=Voter registration is so hot right now|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/09/25/politics/voter-registration-day-millennials-midterms/index.html|newspaper=CNN}}</ref> [[Rock the Vote]], a platform used by grassroots campaigns,<ref name=\"YV 2004\" /><ref name=OC /><ref name=CNN18/> by 2018 had registered over 7 million votes and gained over 350 partners directing people to its online registration tool.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rockthevote.org/resources/online-voter-registration-tool/|title=Online Voter Registration Platform|access-date=2018-10-07}}</ref>\n\nEfforts before the 1970s include:\n* [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]]\n*[[Black Panthers]]\n* [[Young Lords]]\n*[[Youth Liberation of Ann Arbor]]\n\nLater efforts include:\n* [[18 in '08]]\n*[https://www.18by.vote/ 18by.Vote]\n* Bus Federation Civic Fund\n* Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE) \n* [[College Republicans]] and [[College Democrats of America]] all over country\n* [[Declare Yourself]]<ref name=\"YV 2004\" />\n* HeadCount, picked by the [[Ad Council]] in 2018 for a spot to be seen by 10 million\n* Hip Hop Summit Action Network<ref name=\"YV 2004\" />\n* Inspire U.S.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.inspire-usa.org | title=Inspire U.S}}</ref>\n* [[League of Young Voters]] \n* MTV<ref name=\"YV 2004\" />\n* [[National Stonewall Democrats]]<ref name=\"YV 2004\" />\n* New Voters Project<ref name=\"YV 2004\" />\n* [[New York Public Interest Research Group]] (NYPIRG)\n* [[Sean Combs]]'s \"Vote or Die\" campaign<ref name=\"YV 2004\" />\n* Spitfire Strategies<ref name=\"YV 2004\" />\n* [[Our Time (nonprofit)|Our Time]] \n* TurboVote.org (with Snapchat and others)<ref>{{cite news|date=2018-10-24|title=Snapchat Helped Register Over 400,000 Voters|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/23/technology/snapchat-voter-registration-midterms.html}}</ref>\n* [[When We All Vote]], co-chaired by [[Michelle Obama]]<ref name=CNN18/>\n* World Wrestling Entertainment's Smackdown Your Vote<ref name=\"YV 2004\" />\n* Young Greens Caucus\n* Young Voter PAC \n* Young Voter's Alliance<ref name=\"YV 2004\" />\n* YouthVote USA\n\n===Campaign strategies===\n\nBecause the youth population is so large, many campaigns try to gain their support during elections.<ref name=\"YV 2004\" /> Efforts to capture the youth vote include [[Voter registration campaign|registration drives]], outreach and specifically youth-friendly policy platforms.  An example of a fairly successful voter registration drive would be the \"Reggie the Rig\" drive by the [[Republican National Committee]] in the 2004 election.  With a goal of registering three million new voters, the \"Reggie the Rig\" bus travelled to college campuses, a place to reach thousands of youth at once.<ref name=\"YV 2004\" />  During the same election, the Democrats held their own campus visits, but instead of focusing on registration, the Kerry campaign spread the word about their youth policy platform called Compact with the Next Generation.<ref name=\"YV 2004\" />  The Democrats also placed targeted ads on TV during shows such as ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and ''[[The Daily Show]]'' with Jon Stewart.<ref name=\"YV 2004\" />  This targeted campaign on TV has often been supplemented with outreach through the internet in modern campaigns.  New technology, the internet especially, is making it easier for candidates to reach the youth.  It has been found that \"young people who encounter campaign information on their own accord and spend time interacting with political material may come to see themselves interested in politics.\"<ref name=\"Tech and Poli\" />\n\nYoung adults are \"over-represented among all computer and Internet users\" \u2013 three fourths of Americans under the age of 18 are able to access a computer and, on average, use it for half an hour a day.<ref name=\"Tech and Poli\" />   As the Internet and computers have become more accessible to youth, such methods have been used to seek and find information and share it on social media cites. Websites such as [[Facebook]] and [[YouTube]] not only allow youth who don't subscribe to newspapers or watch the evening news to stay on top of the polls, but also allows them to share their opinions of the polls and candidates.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Von Drehle, David. \"Why Young Voters Care Again.\" Time Magazine. Feb 2008:34-48</ref>  If the use of technology were to be fully integrated into politics, the youth and adult groups would be equally active in politics.<ref name=\"Tech and Poli\" />\nOnline news media, in particular, is believed to have a positive impact on young citizens due to its interactivity.<ref name=\"journals.sagepub.com\">{{Cite journal | doi=10.1177/0267323112465369|title = Age and the effects of news media attention and social media use on political interest and participation: Do social media function as leveller?| journal=European Journal of Communication| volume=28| pages=19\u201334|year = 2013|last1 = Holt|first1 = Kristoffer| last2=Shehata| first2=Adam| last3=Str\u00f6mb\u00e4ck| first3=Jesper| last4=Ljungberg| first4=Elisabet}}</ref>\nIt not only provides them with the information they need to form their political beliefs and to become more informed regarding democracy and to gain a better understanding of current issues. But, it also provides them with a platform to discuss these ideas with other individuals, not only on a more localized scale but also on a global scale.<ref name=\"journals.sagepub.com\"/>\n\n===Legislation===\n\nIn the United States, there has been legislation passed that helped youth access the vote.  The [[National Voter Registration Act]] (NVRA), often called the \"motor-voter\" law, passed in 1993, allows those 18 years and older to register to vote at a driver's license office or public assistance agency.<ref name=OC />  The law also required states to accept a uniform mail-in voter registration application.<ref name=OC />  Additionally, some states have extended the period in which citizens can vote instead of requiring a vote within 12 hours on a single day.<ref name=OC />\n\nTwo cities in [[Maryland]], [[Takoma Park]] and [[Hyattsville]] allow 16 and 17-year-olds to vote in local elections.<ref>[http://vote16usa.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Resources.Fact-Sheet.pdf]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Youth politics]]\n*[[Youth suffrage]]\n*[[Young Voters for the President]]\n*[[Apathy is Boring]], a Canadian non-profit and non-partisan organization that promotes youth involvement in politics\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n* John B.

OpenVX is designed by the [[Khronos Group]] to enable performance and power-optimized computer vision processing, especially important in [[embedded]] and [[real-time]] use cases such as the face, body, and gesture tracking, smart video surveillance, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), object and scene reconstruction, augmented reality, visual inspection, robotics and more. It uses a [[connected graph]] representation of operations.\n\n==Overview==\nOpenVX specifies a higher [[Abstraction layer|level of abstraction]] for programming computer vision use cases than compute frameworks such as [[OpenCL]]. The high level makes the programming easy and the underlying execution will be efficient on different computing architectures. This is done while having a consistent and portable vision acceleration API.\n\nOpenVX is based on a connected graph of vision nodes that can execute the preferred chain of operations. It is possible to optimize the underlying implementation through various techniques, for example, acceleration on various [[Central processing unit|processing unit]]s or [[ASIC|dedicated hardware]]. This architecture facilitates applications programmed in OpenVX on different systems with different power and performance, including battery-sensitive, vision-enabled, [[Wearable Display|wearable display]]s.\n\nOpenVX is complementary to the open-source vision library [[OpenCV]]. OpenVX in some applications offers better-optimized graph management than OpenCV.\n\n==OpenVX Feature Sets==\nTo enable deployment flexibility while avoiding fragmentation, OpenVX 1.3 defines a number of feature sets that are targeted at common embedded use cases. Hardware vendors can include one or more complete feature sets in their implementations to meet the needs of their customers and be fully conformant. The flexibility of OpenVX enables deployment on a diverse range of accelerator architectures, and feature sets are expected to dramatically increase the breadth and diversity of available OpenVX implementations. The defined OpenVX 1.3 feature sets include:\n\n* Graph Infrastructure (baseline for other Feature Sets)\n* Default Vision\n* Enhanced Vision (functions introduced in OpenVX 1.2)\n* Neural Network Inferencing (including tensor objects)\n* NNEF Kernel import (including tensor objects)\n* Binary Images\n* Safety-Critical (reduced features to enable easier safety certification)\n\n==OpenVX: Vision Acceleration==\nOpenVX extends easily with reusable vision acceleration functions to every low-power domain. This provides a key advantage, promoting wide adoption, for OpenVX and for developers this delivers the following:\n\n* Royalty-free open standard API that is reliably accelerated by hardware vendors and tightly defined conformance tests.\n* Targeted at low-power, real-time applications including mobile and embedded platforms.\n* Portability across diverse heterogeneous processors, including ISPs, dedicated hardware, DSPs and DSP arrays, GPUs, multi-core CPUs, and more.\n* No requirement for a high-power CPU/GPU complex. A low-power host can set up and manage frame-rate vision processing pipelines.\n\n==OpenVX Graph==\nOpenVX allows graph-level processing optimizations, which lets implementations to fuse nodes when possible to achieve better overall performance. The graph also allows for auto graph-level memory optimizations to achieve a low memory footprint. OpenVX graph-optimized workloads can be deployed on a wide range of computer hardware, including small embedded CPUs, ASICs, APUs, discrete GPUs, and heterogeneous servers.\n\n* OpenVX developers express a graph of image operations, called \u2018nodes,\u2019 which can be on any hardware or processor coded in any language.\n* OpenVX Graphs enable implementations to optimize power and performance. Nodes may be fused by the implementation to eliminate memory transfers, and processing can be tiled to keep data entirely in local memory/cache.\n* Host interaction is minimized by the OpenVX Graph during frame-rate graph execution. The host processor can set up a graph which can then execute almost autonomously.\n\n==Conformant Implementations==\nHardware vendors provide optimized OpenVX drivers, architected to get the best performance form their silicon architecture and ready for developers to use.

This provides a key advantage, promoting wide adoption, for OpenVX and for developers this delivers the following:\n\n* Royalty-free open standard API that is reliably accelerated by hardware vendors and tightly defined conformance tests.\n* Targeted at low-power, real-time applications including mobile and embedded platforms.\n* Portability across diverse heterogeneous processors, including ISPs, dedicated hardware, DSPs and DSP arrays, GPUs, multi-core CPUs, and more.\n* No requirement for a high-power CPU/GPU complex. A low-power host can set up and manage frame-rate vision processing pipelines.\n\n==OpenVX Graph==\nOpenVX allows graph-level processing optimizations, which lets implementations to fuse nodes when possible to achieve better overall performance. The graph also allows for auto graph-level memory optimizations to achieve a low memory footprint. OpenVX graph-optimized workloads can be deployed on a wide range of computer hardware, including small embedded CPUs, ASICs, APUs, discrete GPUs, and heterogeneous servers.\n\n* OpenVX developers express a graph of image operations, called \u2018nodes,\u2019 which can be on any hardware or processor coded in any language.\n* OpenVX Graphs enable implementations to optimize power and performance. Nodes may be fused by the implementation to eliminate memory transfers, and processing can be tiled to keep data entirely in local memory/cache.\n* Host interaction is minimized by the OpenVX Graph during frame-rate graph execution. The host processor can set up a graph which can then execute almost autonomously.\n\n==History==\n* OpenVX 1.0 specification was released in October 2014. \n* OpenVX sample implementation was released in December 2014.\n* OpenVX 1.1 specification was released on May 2, 2016.\n* OpenVX 1.2 was released on May 1, 2017.<ref>https://www.khronos.org/news/press/openvx-1.2-specification-cross-platform-acceleration-power-efficient-vision</ref>\n* Updated OpenVX adopters program and OpenVX 1.2 conformance test suite was released on November 21, 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.khronos.org/news/press/khronos-releases-updated-openvx-adopters-program|title=Khronos Releases Updated OpenVX Adopters Program|date=2017-11-21|work=The Khronos Group|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en}}</ref>\n*OpenVX 1.2.1 was released on November 27, 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenVX/|title=Khronos OpenVX Registry - The Khronos Group Inc|website=www.khronos.org|access-date=2019-08-05}}</ref>\n*OpenVX 1.3 was released on October 22, 2019.<ref>https://www.khronos.org/news/press/khronos-releases-openvx-1.3-open-standard-for-cross-platform-vision-and-machine-intelligence-acceleration</ref>\n\n== Implementations, frameworks and libraries ==\n\n* [https://gpuopen-professionalcompute-libraries.github.io/MIVisionX/ AMD MIVisionX] - for [[AMD]]'s [[Amd cpus|CPUs]] and [[AMD GPUs|GPUs]].\n* [https://ip.cadence.com/vision Cadence] - for [[Cadence Design Systems]]'s Tensilica Vision DSPs.\n* [https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2016/01/06/799884/0/en/PowerVR-GPUs-From-Imagination-Pass-OpenVX-Conformance-With-Khronos.html Imagination] - for [[Imagination Technologies]]'s PowerVR GPUs\n* [https://www.synopsys.com/dw/ipdir.php?ds=ev6x-vision-processors Synopsys] - for [[Synopsys]]' DesignWare EV Vision Processors\n* [https://www.ti.com/processors/automotive-processors/tdax-adas-socs/design-development.html Texas Instruments\u2019 OpenVX (TIOVX)] - for [[Texas Instruments]]\u2019 Jacinto\u2122 ADAS SoCs.\n* [https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/visionworks NVIDIA VisionWorks] - for [[CUDA|CUDA-capable]] [[Nvidia]] [[Nvidia gpus|GPUs]] and [[Tegra|SoCs]].\n* [https://software.intel.com/en-us/openvino-toolkit OpenVINO] - for [[Intel]]'s [[List of Intel microprocessors|CPUs]], [[List of Intel graphics processing units|GPUs]], [[Intel VPUs|VPUs]], and [[Intel FPGAs|FPGAs]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|https://www.khronos.org/openvx/|name=Official website for OpenVX}}\n* [https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenVX/ OpenVX Specification Registry]\n* [https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenVX-sample-impl OpenVX Sample Implementation]\n* [https://github.com/KhronosGroup/openvx-samples OpenVX Sample Applications]\n* [https://github.com/rgiduthuri/openvx_tutorial OpenVX Tutorial Material]\n\n{{Khronos Group standards}}\n\n[[Category:Application programming interfaces]]\n[[Category:Cross-platform software]]\n", "name_user": "Kiritigowda", "label": "safe", "comment": "Conformance Implementations", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenVX"}
