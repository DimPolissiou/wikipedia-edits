A Wuhan hospital notified the local center for disease control and prevention (CDC) and health commissions on 27 December 2019.

The potential disease outbreak soon drew nationwide attention including that of the [[National Health Commission]] (NHC) in [[Beijing]] who sent experts to Wuhan on the following day.

[[pneumonia]] cases in [[Wuhan]], the capital of [[Hubei|Hubei Province]], China. A Wuhan hospital notified the local center for disease control and prevention (CDC) and health commissions on 27 December 2019. On 31 December Wuhan CDC admitted that there was a cluster of unknown pneumonia cases related to [[Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market|Huanan Seafood Market]] after the unverified documents appeared on the Internet.

She pronounced her given name with three syllables: \"I-REE-nee\".\n\nWorth made her [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut in 1943, joined the [[the Old Vic|Old Vic]] company in 1951 and the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] in 1962. She won the [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role|BAFTA Award for Best British Actress]] for the 1958 film ''[[Orders to Kill]]''. Her other film appearances included ''[[Nicholas and Alexandra]]'' (1971) and ''[[Deathtrap (film)|Deathtrap]]'' (1982). A three-time Tony Award winner, she won the [[Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play]] for ''[[Tiny Alice]]'' in 1965 and ''[[Sweet Bird of Youth]]'' in 1976, and won the 1991 [[Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play]] for ''[[Lost in Yonkers]]'', a role she reprised in the 1993 [[Lost in Yonkers (film)|film version]]. One of her later stage performances was opposite [[Paul Scofield]] in the 2001 production of ''I Take Your Hand in Mine'' at the [[Almeida Theatre]] in London.\n\n==Early life==\n'''Harriet Elizabeth Abrams''' was born in Fairbury, Nebraska to a [[Mennonite]] family.<ref>{{cite book |last= Ratliff |first= Walter |title= Pilgrims On The Silk Road: A Muslim-Christian Encounter in Khiva |publisher= [[Wipf & Stock]] |date=January 2010 |isbn= 1-60608-133-0}}</ref> Her parents, Agnes Thiessen and Henry Abrams, were educators. They moved from Nebraska to California in 1920.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/mar/13/local/me-worth13 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Don | last=Shirley | title=Irene Worth, 85; Actress Was 3-Time Tony Winner | date=March 13, 2002}}</ref> She was educated at [[Newport Harbor High School]], Santa Ana Junior College, and UCLA.\n\n==Career==\n\n===Shakespeare and the West End===\nShe joined the [[Old Vic]] company in 1951, worked with [[Tyrone Guthrie]] and there played [[Othello|Desdemona]], Helena in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', Portia in ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' and her first [[Macbeth|Lady Macbeth]]. The company went to South Africa with Worth as one of the leading ladies.\n\nIn 1953, she joined the fledgling [[Stratford Festival of Canada|Shakespeare Festival]] in Stratford, Ontario for its inaugural season. There she was the principal leading lady, performing under an enormous tent with [[Alec Guinness]] in ''[[All's Well That Ends Well]]'' and ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canadianshakespeares.ca/multimedia/video/m_v_4.cfm|title=The Stratford Adventure|website=www.canadianshakespeares.ca}}</ref> \"Binkie\" Beaumont brought her back to London in N.C. Hunter's \"Chekhovian\" drama ''[[A Day by the Sea]]'', with a cast that included [[John Gielgud]] and [[Ralph Richardson]]. She joined the Midland Theatre Company in Coventry for [[Ugo Betti]]'s ''The Queen and the Rebels''. Her transformation from \"a rejected slut cowering at her lover's feet into a redemption of regal poise\" ensured a transfer to London, where [[Kenneth Tynan]] wrote of her technique: \"It is grandiose, heartfelt, marvellously controlled, clear as crystal and totally unmoving.\"\n\nIn the 1950s, Worth demonstrated her exceptional versatility by playing in the farce ''[[L'H\u00f4tel_du_libre_\u00e9change#Translation|Hotel Paradiso]]'' in London with [[Alec Guinness]], high tragedy in the title role of [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]]'s ''[[Mary Stuart (play)|Mary Stuart]]'', co-starring [[Eva Le Gallienne]], and on Broadway and Shakespearean comedy in ''[[As You Like It]]'' at Stratford, Ontario. In [[Ivor Brown]]'s play ''William's Other Anne'', she played Shakespeare's first girlfriend [[Anne Whateley]] opposite [[John Gregson]] as Shakespeare.<ref>[http://english.oxfordjournals.org/content/9/53/179.full.pdf Thespis, Plays, Films, Television, ''English'', Summer 1953; 9: 179 - 18]</ref> She also made a number of well-regarded appearances in British films of the period, most notably her powerful performance as a French Resistance agent in [[Anthony Asquith]]'s 1958 wartime espionage drama ''[[Orders to Kill]]'', which earned her the BAFTA award for Best Supporting Actress.\n\n===The RSC, the National Theatre and Greenwich ===\nIn 1962, she joined the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] at the [[Aldwych Theatre]], and it was there that she gave some of her great performances. She was Goneril to [[Paul Scofield]]'s Lear in [[Peter Brook]]'s acclaimed ''[[King Lear]]'', the first of many collaborations with Brook. She recreated her implacable Goneril in the stark, black-and-white film version of this production. She repeated her Lady Macbeth and appeared again for Brook in [[Friedrich D\u00fcrrenmatt]]'s ''[[Die Physiker|The Physicists]]''. Playing an asylum superintendent, she showed the darker side of her acting. She then went to New York City in 1965 for the opening of [[Edward Albee]]'s enigmatic ''[[Tiny Alice]]'', in which she co-starred with [[John Gielgud]] and which won her the first of her three [[Tony Award]]s.\n\nShe returned to the [[Royal Shakespeare Company|RSC]] at the Aldwych to repeat her role. She worked with Peter Brook in Paris and toured Iran with ''[[Orghast]]'', Brook's attempt to develop an international theatre language. She joined the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] at the Old Vic in 1968 to play Jocasta in Peter Brook's production of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]'s ''[[Oedipus]]'', opposite Gielgud. She was proud to have been in [[No\u00ebl Coward]]'s last play ''[[Suite in Three Keys]]'', in which he made his last appearance on stage. In 1974, she appeared in three thematically linked plays at the [[Greenwich Theatre]] directed by [[Jonathan Miller]] under the umbrella title of Family Romances and using the same actors for each play. Worth took the roles of Gertrude in ''[[Hamlet]]'', Madame Arkadina in Chekhov's ''[[The Seagull]]'', and Mrs Alving in Ibsen's ''[[Ghosts]]''.\n\n===America===\nWorth spent most of the 1970s in North America. She was an acclaimed [[Hedda Gabler]] at Stratford, Ontario, a role she considered one of her more satisfying achievements and which prompted [[Walter Kerr]] to write in ''[[The New York Times]]'' \"Miss Worth is just possibly the best actress in the world.\"\n\nShe played Princess Kosmonopolis in [[Tennessee Williams]]'s ''[[Sweet Bird of Youth]]'' opposite [[Christopher Walken]], which brought her a second Tony Award. She was Madame Ranevskaya in ''[[The Cherry Orchard]]'', for which she received another Tony nomination and which featured [[Ra\u00fal Juli\u00e1]], [[Mary Beth Hurt]] and [[Meryl Streep]], whose career was in its beginning stages. Toward the end of the decade she played Winnie in [[Samuel Beckett|Beckett's]] ''[[Happy Days (play)|Happy Days]]''.\n\nWorth also appeared in the premiere of ''[[The Lady from Dubuque]]'', another Albee play, which closed after 12 performances; a revival of [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]]'s'' [[John Gabriel Borkman]]''; ''[[Toys in the Attic (play)|Toys in the Attic]]'' by [[Lillian Hellman]]; and ''The Golden Age'' by [[A.R. Gurney]].\n\n===The later years===\nShe starred as the goddess Athena in The [[National Radio Theater]]'s 1981 [[Peabody Award]]-winning radio drama of ''The [[Odyssey]] of Homer''. On screen in 1982, Worth co-starred with [[Michael Caine]] and [[Christopher Reeve]] in the film version of a Broadway murder mystery ''[[Deathtrap (film)|Deathtrap]]'', playing a psychic.\n\nIn 1984, [[Peter Hall (theatre director)|Peter Hall]] invited her to return to the National Theatre to play Volumnia in ''[[Coriolanus (play)|Coriolanus]]'', with [[Ian McKellen]] in the title role. The impresario [[Joseph Papp]] persuaded her to repeat Volumnia off-Broadway in a production by [[Steven Berkoff]], when she again was partnered by Christopher Walken as Coriolanus. She was seen in [[David Hare (dramatist)|David Hare]]'s ''[[The Bay at Nice]]'' (National, 1987) and in ''[[Ch\u00e8re Ma\u00eetre]]'' (New York, 1998 and Almeida, London 1999), compiled by [[Peter Eyre]] from the letters of [[George Sand]] and [[Gustave Flaubert]]. Worth also starred along with [[Michael Hordern]] in [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s play ''[[You Never Can Tell (play)|You Never Can Tell]]'' at the Theatre Royal, Haymarket in 1987 and 1998. \n\nIn 1991, she won a third Tony for her performance as the tough-as-nails Grandma Kurnitz in [[Neil Simon]]'s ''[[Lost in Yonkers]]'', and later appeared in the film version along with [[Richard Dreyfuss]] and [[Mercedes Ruehl]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.celebritywonder.com/movie/1993_Lost_in_Yonkers.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-01-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224095900/http://celebritywonder.com/movie/1993_Lost_in_Yonkers.html |archive-date=2009-02-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, she appeared in the film ''[[Onegin (film)|Onegin]]''. As she was about to begin preview performances in a Broadway revival of [[Jean Anouilh|Anouilh]]'s ''Ring Round the Moon'', Worth had a stroke and never appeared in the production. She continued to act, and in September 2001, one of her later appearances was with Paul Scofield at the [[Almeida Theatre]] in the two-handed play ''I Take Your Hand in Mine'', by Carol Rocamora based on the love letters of [[Anton Chekhov]] and [[Olga Knipper]].\n\n===Recitals===\nDuring the mid-1960s in New York, Worth and Gielgud had collaborated in a series of dramatic readings, first from T.S. Eliot and [[Edith Sitwell]] and then from Shakespeare. It was a form of theatre at which she became more adept as she grew older, drawing from [[Virginia Woolf]], [[Ivan Turgenev]] and No\u00ebl Coward. She referred to them as \"her recitals\". In the mid-1990s, she devised and performed a two-hour monologue ''Portrait of Edith Wharton'', based on [[Edith Wharton|Wharton]]'s life and writings. Using no props, costumes or sets, she created characters entirely through vocal means.\n\n==Death and funeral==\nShe died in 2002, following a second stroke in New York's Roosevelt Hospital, at the age of 85. At her memorial service, held at [[the Public Theater]] in New York City, numerous speakers paid tribute to her, including [[Edward Albee]], [[Christopher Walken]], [[Mercedes Ruehl]], [[Meryl Streep]] and [[Alan Rickman]].<ref>Irene Worth Memorial https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/29/arts/irene-worth-memorial.html</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n* [[Daily Mail]] Television Award ''[[The Lady from the

the British Empire|CBE]] (June 23, 1916{{spaced ndash}}March 9, 2002) was an American stage and screen actress who became one of the leading stars of the British and American theatre. She pronounced her given name with three syllables: \"I-REE-nee\".\n\nWorth made her [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut in 1943, joined the [[the Old Vic|Old Vic]] company in 1951 and the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] in 1962. She won the [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role|BAFTA Award for Best British Actress]] for the 1958 film ''[[Orders to Kill]]''. Her other film appearances included ''[[Nicholas and Alexandra]]'' (1971) and ''[[Deathtrap (film)|Deathtrap]]'' (1982). A three-time Tony Award winner, she won the [[Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play]] for ''[[Tiny Alice]]'' in 1965 and ''[[Sweet Bird of Youth]]'' in 1976, and won the 1991 [[Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play]] for ''[[Lost in Yonkers]]'', a role she reprised in the 1993 [[Lost in Yonkers (film)|film version]]. One of her later stage performances was opposite [[Paul Scofield]] in the 2001 production of ''I Take Your Hand in Mine'' at the [[Almeida Theatre]] in London.\n\n==Early life==\n'''Harriet Elizabeth Abrams''' was born in Fairbury, Nebraska to a [[Mennonite]] family.<ref>{{cite book |last= Ratliff |first= Walter |title= Pilgrims On The Silk Road: A Muslim-Christian Encounter in Khiva |publisher= [[Wipf & Stock]] |date=January 2010 |isbn= 1-60608-133-0}}</ref> Her parents, Agnes Thiessen and Henry Abrams, were educators. They moved from Nebraska to California in 1920.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/mar/13/local/me-worth13 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Don | last=Shirley | title=Irene Worth, 85; Actress Was 3-Time Tony Winner | date=March 13, 2002}}</ref> She was educated at [[Newport Harbor High School]], Santa Ana Junior College, and UCLA.\n\n==Career==\n\n===Shakespeare and the West End===\nShe joined the [[Old Vic]] company in 1951, worked with [[Tyrone Guthrie]] and there played [[Othello|Desdemona]], Helena in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', Portia in ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' and her first [[Macbeth|Lady Macbeth]]. The company went to South Africa with Worth as one of the leading ladies.\n\nIn 1953, she joined the fledgling [[Stratford Festival of Canada|Shakespeare Festival]] in Stratford, Ontario for its inaugural season. There she was the principal leading lady, performing under an enormous tent with [[Alec Guinness]] in ''[[All's Well That Ends Well]]'' and ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canadianshakespeares.ca/multimedia/video/m_v_4.cfm|title=The Stratford Adventure|website=www.canadianshakespeares.ca}}</ref> \"Binkie\" Beaumont brought her back to London in N.C. Hunter's \"Chekhovian\" drama ''[[A Day by the Sea]]'', with a cast that included [[John Gielgud]] and [[Ralph Richardson]]. She joined the Midland Theatre Company in Coventry for [[Ugo Betti]]'s ''The Queen and the Rebels''. Her transformation from \"a rejected slut cowering at her lover's feet into a redemption of regal poise\" ensured a transfer to London, where [[Kenneth Tynan]] wrote of her technique: \"It is grandiose, heartfelt, marvellously controlled, clear as crystal and totally unmoving.\"\n\nIn the 1950s, Worth demonstrated her exceptional versatility by playing in the farce ''[[L'H\u00f4tel_du_libre_\u00e9change#Translation|Hotel Paradiso]]'' in London with [[Alec Guinness]], high tragedy in the title role of [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]]'s ''[[Mary Stuart (play)|Mary Stuart]]'', co-starring [[Eva Le Gallienne]], and on Broadway and Shakespearean comedy in ''[[As You Like It]]'' at Stratford, Ontario. In [[Ivor Brown]]'s play ''William's Other Anne'', she played Shakespeare's first girlfriend [[Anne Whateley]] opposite [[John Gregson]] as Shakespeare.<ref>[http://english.oxfordjournals.org/content/9/53/179.full.pdf Thespis, Plays, Films, Television, ''English'', Summer 1953; 9: 179 - 18]</ref> She also made a number of well-regarded appearances in British films of the period, most notably her powerful performance as a French Resistance agent in [[Anthony Asquith]]'s 1958 wartime espionage drama ''[[Orders to Kill]]'', which earned her the BAFTA award for Best Supporting Actress.\n\n===The RSC, the National Theatre and Greenwich ===\nIn 1962, she joined the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] at the [[Aldwych Theatre]], and it was there that she gave some of her great performances. She was Goneril to [[Paul Scofield]]'s Lear in [[Peter Brook]]'s acclaimed ''[[King Lear]]'', the first of many collaborations with Brook. She recreated her implacable Goneril in the stark, black-and-white film version of this production. She repeated her Lady Macbeth and appeared again for Brook in [[Friedrich D\u00fcrrenmatt]]'s ''[[Die Physiker|The Physicists]]''. Playing an asylum superintendent, she showed the darker side of her acting. She then went to New York City in 1965 for the opening of [[Edward Albee]]'s enigmatic ''[[Tiny Alice]]'', in which she co-starred with [[John Gielgud]] and which won her the first of her three [[Tony Award]]s.\n\nShe returned to the [[Royal Shakespeare Company|RSC]] at the Aldwych to repeat her role. She worked with Peter Brook in Paris and toured Iran with ''[[Orghast]]'', Brook's attempt to develop an international theatre language. She joined the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] at the Old Vic in 1968 to play Jocasta in Peter Brook's production of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]'s ''[[Oedipus]]'', opposite Gielgud. She was proud to have been in [[No\u00ebl Coward]]'s last play ''[[Suite in Three Keys]]'', in which he made his last appearance on stage. In 1974, she appeared in three thematically linked plays at the [[Greenwich Theatre]] directed by [[Jonathan Miller]] under the umbrella title of Family Romances and using the same actors for each play. Worth took the roles of Gertrude in ''[[Hamlet]]'', Madame Arkadina in Chekhov's ''[[The Seagull]]'', and Mrs Alving in Ibsen's ''[[Ghosts]]''.\n\n===America===\nWorth spent most of the 1970s in North America. She was an acclaimed [[Hedda Gabler]] at Stratford, Ontario, a role she considered one of her more satisfying achievements and which prompted [[Walter Kerr]] to write in ''[[The New York Times]]'' \"Miss Worth is just possibly the best actress in the world.\"\n\nShe played Princess Kosmonopolis in [[Tennessee Williams]]'s ''[[Sweet Bird of Youth]]'' opposite [[Christopher Walken]], which brought her a second Tony Award. She was Madame Ranevskaya in ''[[The Cherry Orchard]]'', for which she received another Tony nomination and which featured [[Ra\u00fal Juli\u00e1]], [[Mary Beth Hurt]] and [[Meryl Streep]], whose career was in its beginning stages. Toward the end of the decade she played Winnie in [[Samuel Beckett|Beckett's]] ''[[Happy Days (play)|Happy Days]]''.\n\nWorth also appeared in the premiere of ''[[The Lady from Dubuque]]'', another Albee play, which closed after 12 performances; a revival of [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]]'s'' [[John Gabriel Borkman]]''; ''[[Toys in the Attic (play)|Toys in the Attic]]'' by [[Lillian Hellman]]; and ''The Golden Age'' by [[A.R. Gurney]].\n\n===The later years===\nShe starred as the goddess Athena in The [[National Radio Theater]]'s 1981 [[Peabody Award]]-winning radio drama of ''The [[Odyssey]] of Homer''. On screen in 1982, Worth co-starred with [[Michael Caine]] and [[Christopher Reeve]] in the film version of a Broadway murder mystery ''[[Deathtrap (film)|Deathtrap]]'', playing a psychic.\n\nIn 1984, [[Peter Hall (theatre director)|Peter Hall]] invited her to return to the National Theatre to play Volumnia in ''[[Coriolanus (play)|Coriolanus]]'', with [[Ian McKellen]] in the title role. The impresario [[Joseph Papp]] persuaded her to repeat Volumnia off-Broadway in a production by [[Steven Berkoff]], when she again was partnered by Christopher Walken as Coriolanus. She was seen in [[David Hare (dramatist)|David Hare]]'s ''[[The Bay at Nice]]'' (National, 1987) and in ''[[Ch\u00e8re Ma\u00eetre]]'' (New York, 1998 and Almeida, London 1999), compiled by [[Peter Eyre]] from the letters of [[George Sand]] and [[Gustave Flaubert]]. Worth also starred along with [[Michael Hordern]] in [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s play ''[[You Never Can Tell (play)|You Never Can Tell]]'' at the Theatre Royal, Haymarket in 1987 and 1998. \n\nIn 1991, she won a third Tony for her performance as the tough-as-nails Grandma Kurnitz in [[Neil Simon]]'s ''[[Lost in Yonkers]]'', and later appeared in the film version along with [[Richard Dreyfuss]] and [[Mercedes Ruehl]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.celebritywonder.com/movie/1993_Lost_in_Yonkers.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-01-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224095900/http://celebritywonder.com/movie/1993_Lost_in_Yonkers.html |archive-date=2009-02-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, she appeared in the film ''[[Onegin (film)|Onegin]]''. As she was about to begin preview performances in a Broadway revival of [[Jean Anouilh|Anouilh]]'s ''Ring Round the Moon'', Worth had a stroke and never appeared in the production. She continued to act, and in September 2001, one of her later appearances was with Paul Scofield at the [[Almeida Theatre]] in the two-handed play ''I Take Your Hand in Mine'', by Carol Rocamora based on the love letters of [[Anton Chekhov]] and [[Olga Knipper]].\n\n===Recitals===\nDuring the mid-1960s in New York, Worth and Gielgud had collaborated in a series of dramatic readings, first from T.S. Eliot and [[Edith Sitwell]] and then from Shakespeare. It was a form of theatre at which she became more adept as she grew older, drawing from [[Virginia Woolf]], [[Ivan Turgenev]] and No\u00ebl Coward. She referred to them as \"her recitals\". In the mid-1990s, she devised and performed a two-hour monologue ''Portrait of Edith Wharton'', based on [[Edith Wharton|Wharton]]'s life and writings. Using no props, costumes or sets, she created characters entirely through vocal means.\n\n==Death and funeral==\nShe died in 2002, following a second stroke in New York's Roosevelt Hospital, at the age of 85. At her memorial service, held at [[the Public Theater]] in New York City, numerous speakers paid tribute to her, including [[Edward Albee]], [[Christopher Walken]], [[Mercedes Ruehl]], [[Meryl Streep]] and [[Alan Rickman]].<ref>Irene Worth Memorial https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/29/arts/irene-worth-memorial.html</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n* [[Daily Mail]] Television Award ''[[The Lady from the

It first played in the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]], and was elected to [[the Football League]] in 1920.  They won promotion to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] in the [[1978\u201379 in English football|1978\u201379 season]], but were relegated in the [[1982\u201383 in English football|1982\u201383 season]]. They returned to the top flight for the [[2017\u201318 in English football|2017\u201318 season]] playing in the [[Premier League]].\n\nThe club played its matches at the [[Goldstone Ground]] between 1902 and 1997. After the stadium was sold, the club played at Gillingham for two years, then at [[Withdean Stadium]] between 1999 and 2011. In 2011, a new stadium [[Falmer Stadium]] was completed and it has served as the home ground for the club since.\n\n== Formation ==\n[[File:Brighton & Hove Albion 1910.jpg|thumb|right|The 1910 team who beat Aston Villa to lift the FA Charity Shield]]\nThe club was first formed as Brighton & Hove United on 24 June 1901, and the name was quickly changed to [[Brighton & Hove Albion]].  The club took the place of a defunct club, Brighton & Hove Rangers, in the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]].<ref name=\"beautifulhistory\">{{cite web |url=https://thebeautifulhistory.wordpress.com/clubs/brighton-hove-albion/ |title= Brighton & Hove Albion|work=The Beautiful History }}</ref> In the Southern League they won their only national honour to date, the [[FA Community Shield|FA Charity Shield]], by defeating Football League Champions [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in 1910.<ref>[http://www.talkfootball.co.uk/guides/brighton_and_hove_albion_history.html Brighton & Hove Albion] ''Talk Football''. Retrieved 9 August 2011</ref> There had previously been Old Brightonians, representing the area in the FA Cup in the 19th Century. \n\nThe club initially played at the Hove County Ground, with a few games were also at Goldstone Ground that was used by Hove F.C. From 1902 onwards, Brighton & Hove Albion F.C. and Hove F.C. shared the [[Goldstone Ground]].<ref name=\"beautifulhistory\"/>\n \nIn 1920, 19 years after the club was formed, they were elected to [[the Football League]]'s new [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]].\n\n== Crest history ==\nThe first known crest (1946\u20131975) to be used by Brighton & Hove Albion was the traditional coat-of-arms design of the twin towns of [[Brighton and Hove]]. A hybrid design employing the shield of Hove and the dolphin crest of Brighton was also used at times while a calligraphic shield was worn on the team shirts in the latter 1950s.\nDuring the 1974/75 season the club became known as 'The Dolphins' and by the beginning of the following season, a new club crest had been introduced.\nBoth this nickname and crest were to prove short-lived, however, following an incident said to have taken place in the Bo'sun public house in Brighton. Prior to a 'derby' fixture with fierce rivals, Crystal Palace, a few away supporters started chanting, \"Eagles, Eagles\" to which a group of Brighton & Hove Albion fans responded with a chant of \"Seagulls, Seagulls\". Current club director, Derek Chapman, is said to have been among the group who first christened the club with this nickname. The club has been known as 'The Seagulls' ever since and in 1977 the club crest was changed once again to represent this.<ref>{{cite news|last=Burnton|first=Simon|title=How Brighton v Crystal Palace grew into an unlikely rivalry|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/football-league-blog/2011/sep/27/brighton-crystal-palace-rivalry|accessdate=11 November 2013|newspaper=Guardian|date=27 September 2011}}</ref>  A round seagull crest was used on club shirts until 1998 when the current design was introduced. New chairman Dick Knight wanted to sweep away all the remnants of the old, disgraced regime and saw an updated crest as a sign to supporters of new beginnings and happier times ahead.\n\nDuring the 2001/02 season, however, the club shirts displayed no seagull crest at all. For the club's centenary season a return was made to the traditional shields of the former boroughs of Brighton and Hove (now officially one city).\nThe Brighton shield shows [[Martlet]]s (birds used often in [[Sussex]] heraldry) and [[coral]] which both represent the sea. The [[Hove]] shield also displays martlets and a ship that has run ashore, representing a French galley, commemorating the French attacks on the coast of Hove during the early 16th century.\n\n==Mike Bamber==\n[[File:Goldstone Ground - geograph-1220106.jpg|thumb|[[Goldstone Ground]] (1902 \u2013 1997)]]\nMike Bamber was the Chairman of Brighton from October 1972 until 1983. He famously brought [[Brian Clough]] to the club later that year and then appointed [[Alan Mullery]], who led the football club to the First Division in the 1978/79 season. He also appointed [[Jimmy Melia]] as Manager who led the club to their one and only [[FA Cup Final]] in 1983. After relegation in the 1982/83 season, Mike Bamber stood down after the most dramatic 11 years in Brighton & Hove Albion's history.\n\n===Brian Clough and Peter Taylor===\nFollowing resignation from First Division [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] Brian Clough and his assistant [[Peter Taylor (footballer, born 1928)|Peter Taylor]] were persuaded by chairman [[Mike Bamber]] to join Brighton, who were then at the foot of the Third Division. Such was the loyalty to Clough that along with himself and Taylor, scouts and backroom staff completed the walk out, following the pair for their brief spell with Brighton.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/1576977.stm |title=BBC SPORT &#124; Football &#124; Obituary: Brian Clough |publisher=BBC News  |date=20 September 2004 |accessdate=11 July 2009}}</ref> He proved less successful on the South Coast than with his previous club, winning only 12 of his 32 games in charge of the [[Football League Third Division|Division Three]] side. Whereas eight months earlier Clough was managing a team playing Juventus in the European Cup, he was now managing a club who, just after his appointment as manager, lost to [[Walton & Hersham F.C.|Walton & Hersham]] 4\u20130 at home in an FA Cup replay. On 1 December 1973, his side lost 8\u20132 at home to [[Bristol Rovers]]. Albion eventually finished in 19th place that season. Clough left Brighton less than a year after his appointment, in July 1974, to become manager of [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] following [[Don Revie]]'s departure to become manager of [[England national football team|England]], though this time Taylor did not join him. Taylor remained for a further two seasons, guiding the team to a 4th-place finish in [[1975\u201376 in English football|1975\u201376]].\n\n===Life at the top (1979\u201383)===\nBrighton's life as a [[the Football League|Football League]] club brought little in the way of success and headlines until 1979, when under the management of former England player [[Alan Mullery]] they were [[Promotion and relegation|promoted]] to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] as [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] [[runners-up]].\n\nIn their first top-flight season, a 4\u20130 home defeat to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] set the tone for an abysmal start to life in the big time. However, an away win to European Cup holders [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] inspired a remarkable recovery and Brighton finished the season well safe from relegation with a respectable 37 points.\n\nThe following season, Brighton found themselves in relegation trouble before an end-of-season rally with wins in the last four games saw them to safety. However, Mullery resigned after a dispute with Mike Bamber over the transfer of [[Mark Lawrenson]] and proposed changes to his coaching staff. He was replaced by [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] manager [[Mike Bailey (footballer)|Mike Bailey]].<ref name=\"pye\">{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/football/that-1980s-sports-blog/2017/may/25/brighton-top-flight-fa-cup-final |title=When Brighton last played in the top flight \u2013 and the FA Cup final \u2013 34 years ago |first=Steven |last=Pye |date=25 May 2017 |work=The Guardian}}</ref>\n\nSeason 1981-82 was the high point of Brighton's stay in the top flight, with the side in the top half or mid-table all season, finishing a credible 13th on 52 points, their highest-ever league finish to date. The following season saw a wildly inconsistent start, with victories over Arsenal and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] mixed in with heavy defeats and poor results in away games, and Mike Bailey eventually lost his job at the start of December 1982. [[Jimmy Melia]] and coach George Aitken took over on a temporary basis, later Melia was made permanent manager.  Melia however was unable to turn the situation around and Brighton ended up being relegated after a defeat at home to Manchester City, and finished the season in bottom place.<ref name=\"pye\"/>\n\nDespite their relegation, Brighton reached their first (and only to date) [[FA Cup]] final and drew 2\u20132 with [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the first match. Brighton's goals were scored by Gordon Smith and Gary Stevens. This was the final that featured the \"miss\" by [[Gordon Smith (footballer born December 1954)|Gordon Smith]] with virtually the last kick of the game in extra time prompting the well known phrase \"and Smith must score\" - in effect it was actually a save by the Manchester United goalkeeper, [[Gary Bailey]]. In the replay Manchester United won 4\u20130, despite Brighton dominating the first twenty minutes of the match.\n\n===Sliding towards another relegation (1983\u201387)===\n\nBrighton's first Second Division campaign for four years began with a three straight defeats, but then things perked up with a run of five games unbeaten, including an amazing 7\u20130 victory over Charlton. However, another run of three defeats was enough to cost Melia his job, with former player [[Chris Cattlin]] stepping up to replace him and steering Brighton to mid-table safety. 1984-85 saw Brighton nearly return to the top flight, missing out on promotion by only two points. However, the following season saw Brighton slump to 11th place which, along with purported complaints from the players about Cattlin's management style, caused the board to axe him in favour of returning hero Alan Mullery. However, Mullery resigned at the start of 1987 due to a combination of indifferent form and unhappiness over the club's financial situation, and after his resignation Brighton would only win two more games all season, resulting in them being relegated again \u2014 this time to the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]].\n\n===A brief revival (1987\u201391)===\nAlthough new manager [[Barry Lloyd]] hadn't been able to save Brighton's [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] status, he helped them regain it at the first time of asking. In 1990\u201391 Brighton spent the season pushing for [[Promotion and relegation|promotion]] to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] and finished sixth. They reached the play-off final after beating [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] 4\u20131 at home and 2\u20131 away but lost to [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] in the final at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] 3\u20131. If the disappointment of missing out on a top flight was traumatic for Brighton supporters, it was nothing compared to the traumas that the club would encounter over the next few years.\n\n===Relegated twice more (1991\u201396)===\nThe club's fans were hoping for a push for promotion to the upcoming new [[Premier League]] for the 1991\u201392 season, but instead they watched their side battle against relegation. The battle was lost and Brighton started the 1992\u201393 season in the new [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]].\nAlong with relegation, the club were universally derided for their playing strip at this time, which consisted of striped shirts and shorts.<ref>{{cite web|title=Room 101 The Worst Kits Ever|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Brighton_and_Hove_Albion/images/brighton___hove_albion_1991-1993-bo.gif|work=Historical Football Kits|accessdate=26 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nBarry Lloyd quit in December 1993, having failed to mount a serious challenge for promotion to [[Football League First Division|Division One]], and was replaced by [[Liam Brady]]. Brady lasted just two years before being replaced by [[Jimmy Case]], but the transition came too late to prevent Brighton from going down to [[Football League Third Division|Division Three]] at the end of the 1995\u201396 season.\n\nMeanwhile, the club's financial situation was becoming increasingly precarious and the club's directors had come to a decision that the [[Goldstone Ground]] would have to be sold in order to pay off some of the club's huge debts.\n\n===Near oblivion (1996\u201398)===\n[[Jimmy Case]] was sacked after a terrible start to 1996\u201397 saw Brighton stuck the bottom of the league by a considerable margin \u2014 they seemed certain to be relegated from the Football League just 14 years after they had almost won the [[FA Cup]]. The club's directors appointed a relative unknown in [[Steve Gritt]], the former joint manager of [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]], in hope of performing a miracle survival.\n\nBrighton's league form steadily improved under Gritt, although their improving chances of survival were put under further threat by a two-point deduction imposed as punishment for a pitch invasion by fans who were protesting against the sale of the [[Goldstone Ground|Goldstone]] ground.\n\n==Dick Knight==\n\n===Steve Gritt===\nBy the last day of the season, after being 13 points adrift at one stage they were off the bottom of the table and had to play the team directly below them, [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]] \u2014 the game was in their hands. If Brighton won or drew, they would be safe. Brighton defender [[Kerry Mayo]] scored an own goal in the first half and it looked as though their 77-year league career was over. But a late goal saved the day and Brighton retained their league status on goals scored (despite Hereford's superior goal difference, since goals scored took precedence in the Football League at the time). Robbie Reinelt scored the goal that will write his place in Albion history, and in the process ending Hereford's 25-year league career as it was relegated to [[National League (English football)|Conference]].<ref name=\"hayward\"/>\n\nThe sale of the Goldstone ground went through in 1997 and this led to Brighton having to play some 70 miles away at Gillingham's [[Priestfield Stadium|Priestfield]] stadium.\n\n1997-98 saw Brighton endure more dismal form but they were never in any real danger of going down because [[Doncaster Rovers]] seemed set for the drop long before Christmas due to exceptionally dreadful form. But the board of directors wanted to move the club forward, and knew that they couldn't go on hoping forever that another team would do even worse than them. So Gritt was axed in February 1998 and replaced by former club captain [[Brian Horton]], who already had managerial experience with [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull]], [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford]], [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and most recently [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield]].\n\nBrighton continued playing their home games at [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] for the 1998\u201399 season and were in contention for a play off place under [[Brian Horton]]. In January 1999 Horton left to join [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] as manager and  Jeff Wood was installed as the new manager of Brighton. With two wins and a draw in the first three games under Wood things continued to look good, however after picking up just 1 point from the next 10 games Brighton fell from play off contention and in April 1999 Wood was sacked. [[Micky Adams]] was appointed Brighton's new manager. Brighton finished the season in 17th place, their early season form enough to ensure they didn't spend a 3rd straight season fighting relegation to the Conference.\n\n===Back home (1999\u20132000)===\nFor the start of the 1999\u20132000 season The Seagulls moved back to Brighton and started playing their home games at [[Withdean Stadium]], a converted athletics track owned by the [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local council]]. The season started very well with Brighton born debutant [[Darren Freeman]] scoring a [[hat-trick]] in a 6-0 demolition of [[Mansfield Town F.C.|Mansfield]] in the first game of the season. Brighton's early season form was very patchy as they struggled to find consistency as a rebuilt squad struggled to gel. This early season inconsistency was carried over into the [[New Year]]. One bright point was Darren Freeman becoming the first goal scorer of the new [[millennium]] when he scored after just 2 minutes against [[Exeter City F.C.|Exeter City]] on 3 January 2000. In February 2000 Brighton signed a little known forward on loan from [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]] called [[Bobby Zamora]]. Zamora made an instant impact scoring in his debut, the 1\u20131 home draw with [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth]]. Brighton lost their next game away at [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton]] 1\u20130, this was to prove their last defeat of the season as the following game a Zamora hat-trick inspired them to a 7\u20131 win at [[Chester City F.C.|Chester City]]. Unfortunately the run of 8 wins and 6 draws came too late to mount a run at the play offs and Brighton finished 11, just 5 points off the play off places.\n\n===Promotion double (2000\u201302)===\n2000-01 was Brighton's first successful season for 13 years. They were crowned champions of [[Football League Third Division|Division Three]] and promoted to [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]], where they made an excellent start and looked good bets for a second successive [[Promotion and relegation|promotion]]. Adams left in October 2001 to work as [[Dave Bassett]]'s assistant at [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester]], being replaced by former Leicester manager [[Peter Taylor (footballer born 1953)|Peter Taylor]]. The transition proved to be a plus point for Brighton, who maintained their good form and ended the season as [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]] champions \u2014 winning a second successive [[Promotion and relegation|promotion]]. Just five years after almost succumbing to the double threat of losing their [[the Football League|Football League]] status and going out of business completely, Brighton were one division away from the [[Premier League|Premiership]].\n\n===Another struggle (2002\u201303)===\n[[Peter John Taylor|Peter Taylor]] decided against renewing his short-term contract after the promotion triumph pursuing potentially bigger and better things at rich and up-and-coming club [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]], so Brighton promoted youth team manager [[Martin Hinshelwood]] in his place. However, Brighton made a terrible start to the 2002\u201303 [[Football League First Division|Division One]] campaign, after winning their first game 3\u20131 away at [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] followed by a 0\u20130 draw against [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry]] they set a record losing sequence losing 12 games in a row, including a 5\u20130 defeat by bitter rivals Crystal Palace on 26 October. Hinshelwood then became Director of Football and [[Steve Coppell]] was handed the manager's duties after the 10th defeat of the run. Coppell's spell started very brightly with a 2-0 half time lead against [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], however some questionable refereeing decisions led to Brighton losing 4\u20132, the 12th and final defeat in the streak. Brighton stopped the slump by beating [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford]] 3\u20132 at [[Withdean Stadium|Withdean]] and continued to improve substantially under Coppell and looked as though they might be able to pull off a miracle survival. Although the great escape eventually proved beyond them, Brighton gained some satisfaction by staying alive until the last game of the season, a 2\u20132 draw at [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby]]. It was at the end of this season that [[Bobby Zamora]], who had been in the double championship winning side and top goalscorer during this period, was sold to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham]] for a \u00a31,500,000 fee.\n\n===Up and down again (2003-06)===\nCoppell moved to [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] in October 2003 and was replaced by [[Mark McGhee]], who had achieved [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]] promotion success with [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] in 1994 and [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] in 2001 \u2014 both times as [[champions]]. McGhee achieved promotion with Brighton at the first time of asking after a dramatic two-legged play-off semi-final against [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon]] in which [[Adam Virgo]] headed an injury time equaliser in extra time to take the tie to 2\u20132 and a subsequent penalty shoot out which Albion won. This was followed by a 1\u20130 victory over [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] in the 2003\u201304 [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]] play-off final (courtesy of a [[Leon Knight]] penalty in the 82nd minute) gaining them a place in the newly named Coca-Cola [[Football League Championship]] for the 2004\u201305 season. Albion finished 20th out of 24 clubs in the 2004\u20132005 season, narrowly avoiding the drop by a single point, but achieving their highest league position for 14 years. Brighton were relegated two games before the end of the 2005\u201306 Championship campaign after a disappointing season on the South coast.\n\n===Wilkins takes over (2006-08)===\nThe season began with uncertainty, over the future of manager [[Mark McGhee]] and consequently the out of contract players. Several board members, led by major shareholder [[Tony Bloom]] wanted McGhee sacked, but chairman [[Dick Knight (businessman)|Dick Knight]] still backed him. The situation was eventually resolved with McGhee retained as manager, youth coach Dean Wilkins promoted to first team coach, and first team coach Dean White named chief scout.\n\nWith pre-season came mixed messages, then manager [[Mark McGhee]] proclaiming promotion was the aim, while Knight stated at the pre-season fans forum that mid-table would be acceptable. The mixed feelings for Seagulls fans continued into the season, as new non-league signing Alex Revell scored a debut goal to secure a 1\u20130 victory at [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham]], but in the immediate aftermath young forward [[Colin Kazim-Richards]] handed in a transfer request that would eventually lead to him leaving the club on deadline day to sign for [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] for \u00a3150,000 with a 25% sell on clause.<ref>[http://www.seagulls.premiumtv.co.uk/page/Latest/0,,10433~890386,00.html Albion Accept CKR Bid] ''Seagulls'', 30 August 2006. Retrieved 30 August 2006</ref>\n\nResults quickly deteriorated, and manager Mark McGhee was sacked at a meeting with Albion chairman [[Dick Knight (businessman)|Dick Knight]] on 7 September 2006. Assistant manager Bob Booker also left the club on the same day, after several years working with a number of managers. Knight cited a loss of faith in McGhee by fans in the previous season's relegation battle as one of the key reasons for his departure, as well as a loss of faith in the dressing room. Following McGhee's sacking the club installed [[Dean Wilkins]] as caretaker-manager. Chief scout Dean White was promoted to Wilkins' assistant manager. The pair were given the posts on a permanent basis on 29 September,<ref>[http://www.seagulls.premiumtv.co.uk/page/Latest/0,,10433~905209,00.html Albion Appoint Wilkins And White].

"{{refimprove|date=February 2011}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2012}}\nThe '''history of [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.]]''' began in 1901.  It first played in the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]], and was elected to [[the Football League]] in 1920.  They won promotion to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] in the [[1978\u201379 in English football|1978\u201379 season]], but were relegated in the [[1982\u201383 in English football|1982\u201383 season]]. They returned to the top flight for the [[2017\u201318 in English football|2017\u201318 season]] playing in the [[Premier League]].\n\nThe club played its matches at the [[Goldstone Ground]] between 1902 and 1997. After the stadium was sold, the club played at Gillingham for two years, then at [[Withdean Stadium]] between 1999 and 2011. In 2011, a new stadium [[Falmer Stadium]] was completed and it has served as the home ground for the club since.\n\n== Formation ==\n[[File:Brighton & Hove Albion 1910.jpg|thumb|right|The 1910 team who beat Aston Villa to lift the FA Charity Shield]]\nThe club was first formed as Brighton & Hove United on 24 June 1901, and the name was quickly changed to [[Brighton & Hove Albion]].  The club took the place of a defunct club, Brighton & Hove Rangers, in the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]].<ref name=\"beautifulhistory\">{{cite web |url=https://thebeautifulhistory.wordpress.com/clubs/brighton-hove-albion/ |title= Brighton & Hove Albion|work=The Beautiful History }}</ref> In the Southern League they won their only national honour to date, the [[FA Community Shield|FA Charity Shield]], by defeating Football League Champions [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in 1910.<ref>[http://www.talkfootball.co.uk/guides/brighton_and_hove_albion_history.html Brighton & Hove Albion] ''Talk Football''. Retrieved 9 August 2011</ref> There had previously been Old Brightonians, representing the area in the FA Cup in the 19th Century. \n\nThe club initially played at the Hove County Ground, with a few games were also at Goldstone Ground that was used by Hove F.C. From 1902 onwards, Brighton & Hove Albion F.C. and Hove F.C. shared the [[Goldstone Ground]].<ref name=\"beautifulhistory\"/>\n \nIn 1920, 19 years after the club was formed, they were elected to [[the Football League]]'s new [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]].\n\n== Crest history ==\nThe first known crest (1946\u20131975) to be used by Brighton & Hove Albion was the traditional coat-of-arms design of the twin towns of [[Brighton and Hove]]. A hybrid design employing the shield of Hove and the dolphin crest of Brighton was also used at times while a calligraphic shield was worn on the team shirts in the latter 1950s.\nDuring the 1974/75 season the club became known as 'The Dolphins' and by the beginning of the following season, a new club crest had been introduced.\nBoth this nickname and crest were to prove short-lived, however, following an incident said to have taken place in the Bo'sun public house in Brighton. Prior to a 'derby' fixture with fierce rivals, Crystal Palace, a few away supporters started chanting, \"Eagles, Eagles\" to which a group of Brighton & Hove Albion fans responded with a chant of \"Seagulls, Seagulls\". Current club director, Derek Chapman, is said to have been among the group who first christened the club with this nickname. The club has been known as 'The Seagulls' ever since and in 1977 the club crest was changed once again to represent this.<ref>{{cite news|last=Burnton|first=Simon|title=How Brighton v Crystal Palace grew into an unlikely rivalry|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/football-league-blog/2011/sep/27/brighton-crystal-palace-rivalry|accessdate=11 November 2013|newspaper=Guardian|date=27 September 2011}}</ref>  A round seagull crest was used on club shirts until 1998 when the current design was introduced. New chairman Dick Knight wanted to sweep away all the remnants of the old, disgraced regime and saw an updated crest as a sign to supporters of new beginnings and happier times ahead.\n\nDuring the 2001/02 season, however, the club shirts displayed no seagull crest at all. For the club's centenary season a return was made to the traditional shields of the former boroughs of Brighton and Hove (now officially one city).\nThe Brighton shield shows [[Martlet]]s (birds used often in [[Sussex]] heraldry) and [[coral]] which both represent the sea. The [[Hove]] shield also displays martlets and a ship that has run ashore, representing a French galley, commemorating the French attacks on the coast of Hove during the early 16th century.\n\n==Mike Bamber==\n[[File:Goldstone Ground - geograph-1220106.jpg|thumb|[[Goldstone Ground]] (1902 \u2013 1997)]]\nMike Bamber was the Chairman of Brighton from October 1972 until 1983. He famously brought [[Brian Clough]] to the club later that year and then appointed [[Alan Mullery]], who led the football club to the First Division in the 1978/79 season. He also appointed [[Jimmy Melia]] as Manager who led the club to their one and only [[FA Cup Final]] in 1983. After relegation in the 1982/83 season, Mike Bamber stood down after the most dramatic 11 years in Brighton & Hove Albion's history.\n\n===Brian Clough and Peter Taylor===\nFollowing resignation from First Division [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] Brian Clough and his assistant [[Peter Taylor (footballer, born 1928)|Peter Taylor]] were persuaded by chairman [[Mike Bamber]] to join Brighton, who were then at the foot of the Third Division. Such was the loyalty to Clough that along with himself and Taylor, scouts and backroom staff completed the walk out, following the pair for their brief spell with Brighton.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/1576977.stm |title=BBC SPORT &#124; Football &#124; Obituary: Brian Clough |publisher=BBC News  |date=20 September 2004 |accessdate=11 July 2009}}</ref> He proved less successful on the South Coast than with his previous club, winning only 12 of his 32 games in charge of the [[Football League Third Division|Division Three]] side. Whereas eight months earlier Clough was managing a team playing Juventus in the European Cup, he was now managing a club who, just after his appointment as manager, lost to [[Walton & Hersham F.C.|Walton & Hersham]] 4\u20130 at home in an FA Cup replay. On 1 December 1973, his side lost 8\u20132 at home to [[Bristol Rovers]]. Albion eventually finished in 19th place that season. Clough left Brighton less than a year after his appointment, in July 1974, to become manager of [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] following [[Don Revie]]'s departure to become manager of [[England national football team|England]], though this time Taylor did not join him. Taylor remained for a further two seasons, guiding the team to a 4th-place finish in [[1975\u201376 in English football|1975\u201376]].\n\n===Life at the top (1979\u201383)===\nBrighton's life as a [[the Football League|Football League]] club brought little in the way of success and headlines until 1979, when under the management of former England player [[Alan Mullery]] they were [[Promotion and relegation|promoted]] to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] as [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] [[runners-up]].\n\nIn their first top-flight season, a 4-0 home defeat to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] set the tone for an abysmal start to life in the big time. However, an away win to European Cup holders [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] inspired a remarkable recovery and Brighton finished the season well safe from relegation with a respectable 37 points.\n\nThe following season, Brighton found themselves in relegation trouble before an end-of-season rally with wins in the last four games saw them to safety. However, Mullery resigned after a dispute with Mike Bamber over the transfer of [[Mark Lawrenson]] and proposed changes to his coaching staff. He was replaced by [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] manager [[Mike Bailey (footballer)|Mike Bailey]].<ref name=\"pye\">{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/football/that-1980s-sports-blog/2017/may/25/brighton-top-flight-fa-cup-final |title=When Brighton last played in the top flight \u2013 and the FA Cup final \u2013 34 years ago |first=Steven |last=Pye |date=25 May 2017 |work=The Guardian}}</ref>\n\nSeason 1981-82 was the high point of Brighton's stay in the top flight, with the side in the top half or mid-table all season, finishing a credible 13th on 52 points, their highest-ever league finish to date. The following season saw a wildly inconsistent start, with victories over Arsenal and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] mixed in with heavy defeats and poor results in away games, and Mike Bailey eventually lost his job at the start of December 1982. [[Jimmy Melia]] and coach George Aitken took over on a temporary basis, later Melia was made permanent manager.  Melia however was unable to turn the situation around and Brighton ended up being relegated after a defeat at home to Manchester City, and finished the season in bottom place.<ref name=\"pye\"/>\n\nDespite their relegation, Brighton reached their first (and only to date) [[FA Cup]] final and drew 2\u20132 with [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the first match. Brighton's goals were scored by Gordon Smith and Gary Stevens. This was the final that featured the \"miss\" by [[Gordon Smith (footballer born December 1954)|Gordon Smith]] with virtually the last kick of the game in extra time prompting the well known phrase \"and Smith must score\" - in effect it was actually a save by the Manchester United goalkeeper, [[Gary Bailey]]. In the replay Manchester United won 4\u20130, despite Brighton dominating the first twenty minutes of the match.\n\n===Sliding towards another relegation (1983\u201387)===\n\nBrighton's first Second Division campaign for four years began with a three straight defeats, but then things perked up with a run of five games unbeaten, including an amazing 7-0 victory over Charlton. However, another run of three defeats was enough to cost Melia his job, with former player [[Chris Cattlin]] stepping up to replace him and steering Brighton to mid-table safety. 1984-85 saw Brighton nearly return to the top flight, missing out on promotion by only two points. However, the following season saw Brighton slump to 11th place which, along with purported complaints from the players about Cattlin's management style, caused the board to axe him in favour of returning hero Alan Mullery. However, Mullery resigned at the start of 1987 due to a combination of indifferent form and unhappiness over the club's financial situation, and after his resignation Brighton would only win two more games all season, resulting in them being relegated again \u2014 this time to the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]].\n\n===A brief revival (1987\u201391)===\nAlthough new manager [[Barry Lloyd]] hadn't been able to save Brighton's [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] status, he helped them regain it at the first time of asking. In 1990\u201391 Brighton spent the season pushing for [[Promotion and relegation|promotion]] to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] and finished sixth. They reached the play-off final after beating [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] 4\u20131 at home and 2\u20131 away but lost to [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] in the final at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] 3-1. If the disappointment of missing out on a top flight was traumatic for Brighton supporters, it was nothing compared to the traumas that the club would encounter over the next few years.\n\n===Relegated twice more (1991\u201396)===\nThe club's fans were hoping for a push for promotion to the upcoming new [[Premier League]] for the 1991\u201392 season, but instead they watched their side battle against relegation. The battle was lost and Brighton started the 1992\u201393 season in the new [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]].\nAlong with relegation, the club were universally derided for their playing strip at this time, which consisted of striped shirts and shorts.<ref>{{cite web|title=Room 101 The Worst Kits Ever|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Brighton_and_Hove_Albion/images/brighton___hove_albion_1991-1993-bo.gif|work=Historical Football Kits|accessdate=26 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nBarry Lloyd quit in December 1993, having failed to mount a serious challenge for promotion to [[Football League First Division|Division One]], and was replaced by [[Liam Brady]]. Brady lasted just two years before being replaced by [[Jimmy Case]], but the transition came too late to prevent Brighton from going down to [[Football League Third Division|Division Three]] at the end of the 1995\u201396 season.\n\nMeanwhile, the club's financial situation was becoming increasingly precarious and the club's directors had come to a decision that the [[Goldstone Ground]] would have to be sold in order to pay off some of the club's huge debts.\n\n===Near oblivion (1996\u201398)===\n[[Jimmy Case]] was sacked after a terrible start to 1996\u201397 saw Brighton stuck the bottom of the league by a considerable margin \u2014 they seemed certain to be relegated from the Football League just 14 years after they had almost won the [[FA Cup]]. The club's directors appointed a relative unknown in [[Steve Gritt]], the former joint manager of [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]], in hope of performing a miracle survival.\n\nBrighton's league form steadily improved under Gritt, although their improving chances of survival were put under further threat by a two-point deduction imposed as punishment for a pitch invasion by fans who were protesting against the sale of the [[Goldstone Ground|Goldstone]] ground.\n\n==Dick Knight==\n\n===Steve Gritt===\nBy the last day of the season, after being 13 points adrift at one stage they were off the bottom of the table and had to play the team directly below them, [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]] \u2014 the game was in their hands. If Brighton won or drew, they would be safe. Brighton defender [[Kerry Mayo]] scored an own goal in the first half and it looked as though their 77-year league career was over. But a late goal saved the day and Brighton retained their league status on goals scored (despite Hereford's superior goal difference, since goals scored took precedence in the Football League at the time). Robbie Reinelt scored the goal that will write his place in Albion history, and in the process ending Hereford's 25-year league career as it was relegated to [[National League (English football)|Conference]].<ref name=\"hayward\"/>\n\nThe sale of the Goldstone ground went through in 1997 and this led to Brighton having to play some 70 miles away at Gillingham's [[Priestfield Stadium|Priestfield]] stadium.\n\n1997-98 saw Brighton endure more dismal form but they were never in any real danger of going down because [[Doncaster Rovers]] seemed set for the drop long before Christmas due to exceptionally dreadful form. But the board of directors wanted to move the club forward, and knew that they couldn't go on hoping forever that another team would do even worse than them. So Gritt was axed in February 1998 and replaced by former club captain [[Brian Horton]], who already had managerial experience with [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull]], [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford]], [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and most recently [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield]].\n\nBrighton continued playing their home games at [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] for the 1998-99 season and were in contention for a play off place under [[Brian Horton]]. In January 1999 Horton left to join [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] as manager and  Jeff Wood was installed as the new manager of Brighton. With two wins and a draw in the first three games under Wood things continued to look good, however after picking up just 1 point from the next 10 games Brighton fell from play off contention and in April 1999 Wood was sacked. [[Micky Adams]] was appointed Brighton's new manager. Brighton finished the season in 17th place, their early season form enough to ensure they didn't spend a 3rd straight season fighting relegation to the Conference.\n\n===Back home (1999\u20132000)===\nFor the start of the 1999-2000 season The Seagulls moved back to Brighton and started playing their home games at [[Withdean Stadium]], a converted athletics track owned by the [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local council]]. The season started very well with Brighton born debutant [[Darren Freeman]] scoring a [[hat-trick]] in a 6-0 demolition of [[Mansfield Town F.C.|Mansfield]] in the first game of the season. Brighton's early season form was very patchy as they struggled to find consistency as a rebuilt squad struggled to gel. This early season inconsistency was carried over into the [[New Year]]. One bright point was Darren Freeman becoming the first goal scorer of the new [[millennium]] when he scored after just 2 minutes against [[Exeter City F.C.|Exeter City]] on 3 January 2000. In February 2000 Brighton signed a little known forward on loan from [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]] called [[Bobby Zamora]]. Zamora made an instant impact scoring in his debut, the 1-1 home draw with [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth]]. Brighton lost their next game away at [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton]] 1-0, this was to prove their last defeat of the season as the following game a Zamora hat-trick inspired them to a 7-1 win at [[Chester City F.C.|Chester City]]. Unfortunately the run of 8 wins and 6 draws came too late to mount a run at the play offs and Brighton finished 11, just 5 points off the play off places.\n\n===Promotion double (2000\u201302)===\n2000-01 was Brighton's first successful season for 13 years. They were crowned champions of [[Football League Third Division|Division Three]] and promoted to [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]], where they made an excellent start and looked good bets for a second successive [[Promotion and relegation|promotion]]. Adams left in October 2001 to work as [[Dave Bassett]]'s assistant at [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester]], being replaced by former Leicester manager [[Peter Taylor (footballer born 1953)|Peter Taylor]]. The transition proved to be a plus point for Brighton, who maintained their good form and ended the season as [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]] champions \u2014 winning a second successive [[Promotion and relegation|promotion]]. Just five years after almost succumbing to the double threat of losing their [[the Football League|Football League]] status and going out of business completely, Brighton were one division away from the [[Premier League|Premiership]].\n\n===Another struggle (2002\u201303)===\n[[Peter John Taylor|Peter Taylor]] decided against renewing his short-term contract after the promotion triumph pursuing potentially bigger and better things at rich and up-and-coming club [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]], so Brighton promoted youth team manager [[Martin Hinshelwood]] in his place. However, Brighton made a terrible start to the 2002\u201303 [[Football League First Division|Division One]] campaign, after winning their first game 3\u20131 away at [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] followed by a 0\u20130 draw against [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry]] they set a record losing sequence losing 12 games in a row, including a 5-0 defeat by bitter rivals Crystal Palace on 26 October. Hinshelwood then became Director of Football and [[Steve Coppell]] was handed the manager's duties after the 10th defeat of the run. Coppell's spell started very brightly with a 2-0 half time lead against [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], however some questionable refereeing decisions led to Brighton losing 4-2, the 12th and final defeat in the streak. Brighton stopped the slump by beating [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford]] 3-2 at [[Withdean Stadium|Withdean]] and continued to improve substantially under Coppell and looked as though they might be able to pull off a miracle survival. Although the great escape eventually proved beyond them, Brighton gained some satisfaction by staying alive until the last game of the season, a 2\u20132 draw at [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby]]. It was at the end of this season that [[Bobby Zamora]], who had been in the double championship winning side and top goalscorer during this period, was sold to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham]] for a \u00a31,500,000 fee.\n\n===Up and down again (2003-06)===\nCoppell moved to [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] in October 2003 and was replaced by [[Mark McGhee]], who had achieved [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]] promotion success with [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] in 1994 and [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] in 2001 \u2014 both times as [[champions]]. McGhee achieved promotion with Brighton at the first time of asking after a dramatic two-legged play-off semi-final against [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon]] in which [[Adam Virgo]] headed an injury time equaliser in extra time to take the tie to 2\u20132 and a subsequent penalty shoot out which Albion won. This was followed by a 1\u20130 victory over [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] in the 2003\u201304 [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]] play-off final (courtesy of a [[Leon Knight]] penalty in the 82nd minute) gaining them a place in the newly named Coca-Cola [[Football League Championship]] for the 2004\u201305 season. Albion finished 20th out of 24 clubs in the 2004\u20132005 season, narrowly avoiding the drop by a single point, but achieving their highest league position for 14 years. Brighton were relegated two games before the end of the 2005\u201306 Championship campaign after a disappointing season on the South coast.\n\n===Wilkins takes over (2006-08)===\nThe season began with uncertainty, over the future of manager [[Mark McGhee]] and consequently the out of contract players. Several board members, led by major shareholder [[Tony Bloom]] wanted McGhee sacked, but chairman [[Dick Knight (businessman)|Dick Knight]] still backed him. The situation was eventually resolved with McGhee retained as manager, youth coach Dean Wilkins promoted to first team coach, and first team coach Dean White named chief scout.\n\nWith pre-season came mixed messages, then manager [[Mark McGhee]] proclaiming promotion was the aim, while Knight stated at the pre-season fans forum that mid-table would be acceptable. The mixed feelings for Seagulls fans continued into the season, as new non-league signing Alex Revell scored a debut goal to secure a 1-0 victory at [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham]], but in the immediate aftermath young forward [[Colin Kazim-Richards]] handed in a transfer request that would eventually lead to him leaving the club on deadline day to sign for [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] for \u00a3150,000 with a 25% sell on clause.<ref>[http://www.seagulls.premiumtv.co.uk/page/Latest/0,,10433~890386,00.html Albion Accept CKR Bid] ''Seagulls'', 30 August 2006. Retrieved 30 August 2006</ref>\n\nResults quickly deteriorated, and manager Mark McGhee was sacked at a meeting with Albion chairman [[Dick Knight (businessman)|Dick Knight]] on 7 September 2006. Assistant manager Bob Booker also left the club on the same day, after several years working with a number of managers. Knight cited a loss of faith in McGhee by fans in the previous season's relegation battle as one of the key reasons for his departure, as well as a loss of faith in the dressing room. Following McGhee\u2019s sacking the club installed [[Dean Wilkins]] as caretaker-manager. Chief scout Dean White was promoted to Wilkins' assistant manager. The pair were given the posts on a permanent basis on 29 September,<ref>[http://www.seagulls.premiumtv.co.uk/page/Latest/0,,10433~905209,00.html Albion Appoint Wilkins And White]. Retrieved 29 September 2006</ref> and former player [[Ian Russell Chapman|Ian Chapman]] was also added to the coaching staff shortly afterwards.\n\nIt was to prove a difficult season for the rookie management team, whose inexperience was mirrored by that of the team, 10 youth players having been awarded contracts in the summer [http://archive.theargus.co.uk/2006/3/10/208742.html], along with several youth team graduates already in the first team. There were some highlights - beating [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]] 4-1 home and away, winning 2-1 away at [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]] (one of only two home defeats for the eventual champions), and thrashing [[Conference National|Conference]] side [[Northwich Victoria F.C.|Northwich Victoria]] 8-0 at home in the first round of the [[FA Cup]]. A 3rd round tie away to [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] was a break from League One for Brighton's fans, but their side were beaten 3-0 after a disappointing second-half performance. Albion also reached the Southern area Semi-Final of the [[Football League Trophy]]. January signing [[Bas Savage]] claimed cult fame on television programme [[Soccer AM]] for his moonwalk celebration following each one of his goals scored for the Albion, which were also proving crucial in keeping Brighton away from a relegation battle.\n\nThe [[2006-07 in English football|2006-07 season]] proved to be very successful for the Seagulls Reserve team, after securing the [[Sussex Senior Challenge Cup|Sussex Senior Cup]] and winning the [[Football Combination]] Southern League by finishing just one point ahead of [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton Reserves]].
