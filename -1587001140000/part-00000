Frequently listed as one of the [[fireside poets]], he was influenced by the Scottish poet [[Robert Burns]]. Whittier is remembered particularly for his anti-slavery writings as well as his book ''[[Snow-Bound]]''.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life and work===\nJohn Greenleaf Whittier was born to John and Abigail (Hussey) at their [[John Greenleaf Whittier Homestead|rural homestead]] in [[Haverhill, Massachusetts]], on December 17, 1807.<ref>Wagenknecht, 3</ref> His middle name is thought to mean 'feuillevert' after his [[Hugenot|Huguenot]] forebears.<ref>Pickard T. Samuel, Life and Letters of John Greenleaf Whittier , Haskell House Publishers, New York , 1907 , SBN 8383-0191-6</ref> He grew up on the farm in a household with his parents, a brother and two sisters, a maternal aunt and paternal uncle, and a constant flow of visitors and hired hands for the farm. As a boy, it was discovered that Whittier was [[color blindness|color-blind]] when he was unable to see a difference between ripe and unripe [[strawberry|strawberries]].<ref>Wagenknecht, 18</ref> Their farm was not very profitable and there was only enough money to get by. Whittier himself was not cut out for hard farm labor and suffered from bad health and physical frailty his whole life. Although he received little formal education, he was an avid reader who studied his father's six books on Quakerism until their teachings became the foundation of his ideology. Whittier was heavily influenced by the doctrines of his religion, particularly its stress on humanitarianism, compassion, and social responsibility.\n\nWhittier was first introduced to poetry by a teacher. His sister sent his first poem, \"The Exile's Departure\", to the [[Newburyport, Massachusetts|Newburyport]] ''Free Press'' without his permission and its editor, [[William Lloyd Garrison]], published it on June 8, 1826.<ref>Wagenknecht, 5</ref> Garrison as well as another local editor encouraged Whittier to attend the recently opened Haverhill Academy. To raise money to attend the school, Whittier became a shoemaker for a time, and a deal was made to pay part of his tuition with food from the family farm.<ref>Woodwell, 12</ref> Before his second term, he earned money to cover tuition by serving as a teacher in a one-room schoolhouse in what is now [[Merrimac, Massachusetts]].<ref>Woodwell, 17</ref> He attended Haverhill Academy from 1827 to 1828 and completed a high school education in only two terms.\n\nGarrison gave Whittier the job of editor of the ''National Philanthropist'', a Boston-based [[temperance movement|temperance]] weekly. Shortly after a change in management, Garrison reassigned him as editor of the weekly ''American Manufacturer'' in Boston.<ref>Woodwell, 25</ref> Whittier became an out-spoken critic of President [[Andrew Jackson]], and by 1830 was editor of the prominent ''New England Weekly Review'' in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], the most influential [[United States Whig Party|Whig]] journal in [[New England]]. He published ''[[The Song of the Vermonters, 1779]]'' anonymously in ''The New England Magazine'' in 1838.  The poem was mistakenly attributed to [[Ethan Allen]] for nearly sixty years.  Whittier acknowledged his authorship in 1858.\n\n===Abolitionist activity===\n[[File:Our Countrymen in Chains.jpg|thumb|Broadside publication of Whittier's ''Our Countrymen in Chains'']]\n\nDuring the 1830s, Whittier became interested in politics but, after losing a Congressional election at age twenty-five, he suffered a nervous breakdown and returned home. The year 1833 was a turning point for Whittier; he resurrected his correspondence with Garrison, and the passionate abolitionist began to encourage the young Quaker to join his cause.\n\nIn 1833, Whittier published the antislavery pamphlet ''Justice and Expediency'',<ref>Wagenknecht, 13</ref> and from there dedicated the next twenty years of his life to the abolitionist cause. The controversial pamphlet destroyed all of his political hopes \u2014 as his demand for immediate emancipation alienated both Northern businessmen and Southern slaveholders \u2014 but it also sealed his commitment to a cause that he deemed morally correct and socially necessary. He was a founding member of the [[American Anti-Slavery Society]] and signed the Anti-Slavery Declaration of 1833, which he often considered the most significant action of his life.\n\nWhittier's political skill made him useful as a lobbyist, and his willingness to badger anti-slavery congressional leaders into joining the abolitionist cause was invaluable. From 1835 to 1838, he traveled widely in the North, attending conventions, securing votes, speaking to the public, and lobbying politicians. As he did so, Whittier received his fair share of violent responses, being several times mobbed, stoned, and run out of town. \n\nFrom 1838 to 1840, he was editor of the ''[[National Enquirer (1836)|Pennsylvania Freeman]]'' in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]],<ref name=Wagenknecht6>Wagenknecht, 6</ref> one of the leading antislavery papers in the North, formerly known as the ''[[National Enquirer (1836)|National Enquirer]]''. In May 1838, the publication moved its offices to the newly opened [[Pennsylvania Hall (Philadelphia)|Pennsylvania Hall]] on North Sixth Street, which was shortly after burned by a pro-slavery mob.<ref>{{cite book\n|last1=Ehrlich\n|first1=Eugene\n|first2=Gorton\n|last2=Carruth\n|title=The Oxford Illustrated Literary Guide to the United States\n|location=New York\n|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]\n|year=1982\n|page=[https://archive.org/details/oxfordillustrate00euge/page/206 206]\n|isbn=0-19-503186-5\n|url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordillustrate00euge/page/206\n}}</ref> Whittier also continued to write poetry and nearly all of his poems in this period dealt with the problem of slavery.\n\nIn 1838 [[Charles G. Atherton]] presented five resolutions which were adopted, and which created a new resolution that barred Congress from discussing petitions which mentioned bringing slavery to an end. Congress approved them on December 12, 1838. This became known as the \u201cAtherton Gag\u201c.  Whittier referred to Atherton in one of his many abolitionists poems as \u201cvile\u201d, by having  allied himself so closely with fellow  Democrats from pro-slavery Southern States. <ref>{{cite book|title=Arguing about Slavery: John Quincy Adams and the Great Battle in the United States by William Lee Miller|access-date=January 16, 2020 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=bKk_DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA342&lpg=PA342&dq=slave.atherton#v=onepage&q=Atherton%20slimy&f=fakes|isbn=9780679768449 |last1=Miller |first1=William Lee |year=1998 }}</ref>\nIt was not until 1844 the House rescinded this gag rule on a motion made by [[John Quincy Adams]].\n\nBy the end of the 1830s, the unity of the abolitionist movement had begun to fracture. Whittier stuck to his belief that moral action apart from political effort was futile. He knew that success required legislative change, not merely moral suasion. This opinion alone engendered a bitter split from Garrison,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Corps|first1=Terry|title=The A to Z of the Jacksonian Era and Manifest Destiny|date=2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Latham, MD|isbn=978-0810868502|pages=343\u201344|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7Vl-FkztfacC&pg=PA343&dq=whittier+split+garrison#v=onepage&q=whittier%20split%20garrison&f=false|accessdate=4 February 2018}}</ref> and Whittier went on to become a founding member of the [[Liberty Party (1840s)|Liberty Party]] in 1839.<ref name=Wagenknecht6/> In 1840 he attended the [[World Anti-Slavery Convention]] in London.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/60228328?loginSuccess=true&seq=3#page_scan_tab_contents List of delegates], Anti-Slavery Convention 1840, Retrieved 3 August 2015</ref> By 1843, he was announcing the triumph of the fledgling party: \"Liberty party is no longer an experiment. It is vigorous reality, exerting ... a powerful influence\".<ref>Laurie, 59</ref> Whittier also unsuccessfully encouraged [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] to join the party.<ref>Laurie, 60</ref> He took editing jobs with the ''Middlesex Standard'' in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]], and the ''Essex Transcript'' in Amesbury until 1844.<ref name=Wagenknecht6/> While in Lowell, he met [[Lucy Larcom]], who became a lifelong friend.<ref>Ehrlich, Eugene and Gorton Carruth. ''The Oxford Illustrated Literary Guide to the United States''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1982: 51. {{ISBN|0-19-503186-5}}</ref>\n\nIn 1845, he began writing his essay \"The Black Man\" which included an anecdote about John Fountain, a free black who was jailed in Virginia for helping slaves escape. After his release, Fountain went on a speaking tour and thanked Whittier for writing his story.<ref>Laurie, 77</ref>\n\nAround this time, the stresses of editorial duties, worsening health, and dangerous mob violence caused him to have a physical breakdown. Whittier went home to Amesbury, and remained there for the rest of his life, ending his ''active'' participation in abolition. Even so, he continued to believe that the best way to gain abolitionist support was to broaden the Liberty Party's political appeal, and Whittier persisted in advocating the addition of other issues to their platform. He eventually participated in the evolution of the Liberty Party into the [[Free Soil Party]], and some say his greatest political feat was convincing [[Charles Sumner]] to run on the Free-Soil ticket for the U.S. Senate in 1850.\n\nBeginning in 1847, Whittier was editor of [[Gamaliel Bailey|Gamaliel Bailey's]] ''The National Era'',<ref name=Wagenknecht6/> one of the most influential abolitionist newspapers in the North. For the next ten years it featured the best of his writing, both as prose and poetry. Being confined to his home and away from the action offered Whittier a chance to write better abolitionist poetry; he was even poet laureate for his party. Whittier's poems often used slavery to represent all kinds of oppression (physical, spiritual, economic), and his poems stirred up popular response because they appealed to feelings rather than logic.\n\nWhittier produced two collections of antislavery poetry: ''Poems Written during the Progress of the Abolition Question in the United States, between 1830 and 1838'' and ''Voices of Freedom'' (1846). He was an [[Electoral College (United States)|elector]] in the [[1860 United States presidential election|presidential election of 1860]] and [[1864 United States presidential election|of 1864]], voting for [[Abraham Lincoln]] both times.<ref name=Wagenknecht8>Wagenknecht, 8</ref>\n\nThe passage of the Thirteenth Amendment in 1865 ended both slavery and his public cause, so Whittier turned to other forms of poetry for the remainder of his life.\n\n===Later life===\n[[File:Whittier John Greenleaf grave.jpg|thumb|left|Grave of John Greenleaf Whittier in Amesbury, MA]]\nWhittier was one of the founding contributors of the magazine ''[[The Atlantic|Atlantic Monthly]]''.\n\nOne of his most enduring works, ''[[Snow-Bound]]'', was first published in 1866. Whittier was surprised by its financial success; he earned $10,000 from the first edition.<ref name=Wagenknecht7>Wagenknecht, 7</ref> In 1867, Whittier asked [[James Thomas Fields]] to get him a ticket to a reading by [[Charles Dickens]] during the British author's visit to the United States. After the event, Whittier wrote a letter describing his experience:\n\n{{quote|My eyes ached all next day from the intensity of my gazing. I do not think his voice naturally particularly fine, but he uses it with great effect. He has wonderful dramatic power ... I like him better than any public reader I have ever before heard.<ref>Wagenknecht, 108\u2013109</ref>}}\n\nWhittier spent the last winters of his life, from 1876 to 1892, at Oak Knoll, the home of his cousins in [[Danvers, Massachusetts]].<ref>Ehrlich, Eugene and Gorton Carruth.

Barber Obelisk (Pioneer Cemetery, Lawrence, KS).jpg|thumb|John Greenleaf Whittier's poem, ''Burial of Barber'' was inspired by the burial of abolitionist T. W. Barber (Barber's tomb pictured in 2018).]]\n[[File:Don\u2019t_Quit_by_John_Greenleaf_Whittier.jpg|thumb|A poem in a portrait of [[John Greenleaf Whittier]] entitled Don\u2019t Quit]]\nWhittier's first two published books were ''Legends of New England'' (1831) and the poem ''[[Moll Pitcher]]'' (1832). In 1833 he published ''[[The Song of the Vermonters, 1779]],'' which he had anonymously inserted in ''The New England Magazine.'' The poem was erroneously attributed to [[Ethan Allen]] for nearly sixty years. This use of poetry in the service of his political beliefs is illustrated by his book ''Poems Written during the Progress of the Abolition Question''.\n\nHighly regarded in his lifetime and for a period thereafter, he is now largely remembered for his anti-slavery writings and his poems ''[[s:Barbara Frietchie|Barbara Frietchie]]'', \"[[The Barefoot Boy]]\", \"[[Maud Muller]]\" and ''Snow-Bound''.\n\nA number of his poems have been turned into [[hymn]]s, including ''[[Dear Lord and Father of Mankind]]'', taken from his poem \"[[Dear Lord and Father of Mankind#The Brewing of Soma|The Brewing of Soma]]\". The latter part of the poem was set in 1924 by Dr. George Gilbert Stocks to the tune of ''Repton'' by English composer [[Hubert Parry]] from the 1888 oratorio ''Judith''. It is also sung as the hymn ''Rest'' by Frederick Maker, and [[Charles Ives]] also set a part of it to music in his song \"Serenity\". On its own, the hymn appears sentimental, though in the context of the entire poem, the stanzas make greater sense, being intended as a contrast with the fevered spirit of pre-Christian worship and that of some modern Christians.\n\nWhittier's Quakerism is better illustrated,{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} however, by the hymn that begins:\n\n{{poemquote|\nO Brother Man, fold to thy heart thy brother:\nWhere pity dwells, the peace of God is there;\nTo worship rightly is to love each other,\nEach smile a hymn, each kindly deed a prayer.\n}}\n\nHis sometimes contrasting sense of the need for strong action against injustice can be seen in his poem \"To R\u00f6nge\" in honor of [[Johannes Ronge]], the German religious figure and rebel leader of the 1848 rebellion in Germany:\n\n{{poemquote|\nThy work is to hew down. In God's name then:\nPut nerve into thy task. Let other men;\nPlant, as they may, that better tree whose fruit,\nThe wounded bosom of the Church shall heal.\n}}\n\nWhittier's poem \"At Port Royal 1861\" describes the experience of Northern abolitionists arriving at [[Battle of Port Royal|Port Royal, South Carolina]], as teachers and missionaries for the slaves who had been left behind when their owners fled because the [[Union Navy]] would arrive to blockade the coast. The poem includes the \"Song of the Negro Boatmen,\" written in dialect:\n\n{{poemquote|\nOh, praise an' tanks! De Lord he come\nTo set de people free;\nAn' massa tink it day ob doom,\nAn' we ob jubilee.\nDe Lord dat heap de Red Sea waves\nHe jus' as 'trong as den;\n\nHe say de word: we las' night slaves;\nTo-day, de Lord's freemen.\nDe yam will grow, de cotton blow,\nWe'll hab de rice an' corn:\nOh, nebber you fear, if nebber you hear\nDe driver blow his horn!\n}}\n\nOf all the poetry inspired by the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the \"Song of the Negro Boatmen\" was one of the most widely printed,<ref name=\"Epstein\">{{cite book| last = Epstein | first = Dena | year =2003 | title =Sinful Tunes and Spirituals: Black Folk Music to the Civil War | publisher =University of Illinois Press| location = Chicago }}</ref> and though Whittier never actually visited Port Royal, an abolitionist working there described his \"Song of the Negro Boatmen\" as \"wonderfully applicable as we were being rowed across Hilton Head Harbor among United States gunboats.\"<ref name=\"McKim\">{{cite journal | last = McKim\n | first = Lucy | title = Songs of the Port Royal 'Contrabands' | journal = Dwight's Journal of Music | volume = 21 | pages = 254\u201355 | date = November 8, 1862 | accessdate = }}</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\n[[File:John Greenleaf Whittier Home - Amesbury, Massachusetts.JPG|thumb|The [[John Greenleaf Whittier Home]] in [[Amesbury, Massachusetts]]]]\n\n[[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] dismissed Whittier's ''Literary Recreations and Miscellanies'' (1854): \"Whittier's book is poor stuff!

He was especially influential on prose writings by Jewett, with whom he shared a belief in the moral quality of literature and an interest in New England folklore. Jewett dedicated one of her books to him and modeled several of her characters after people in Whittier's life.<ref>Blanchard, Paula. ''Sarah Orne Jewett: Her World and Her Work''.

[[SS Whittier Victory|SS ''Whittier Victory'']] a World War 2 ship named after Whittier College. [[Whittier Peak]] in Washington and [[Mount Whittier]] in New Hampshire are mountains named after him.\n\nThe [[alternate history]] story ''[[P.'s Correspondence]]'' (1846) by [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], considered the first such story ever published in English, includes the notice \"Whittier, a fiery Quaker youth, to whom the muse had perversely assigned a battle-trumpet, got himself lynched, in South Carolina\". The date of that event in Hawthorne's invented timeline was 1835.\n\nWhittier was one of thirteen writers in the 1897 card game [[Authors (card game)|Authors]], which referenced his writings \"Laus Deo\", \"Among the Hills\", ''Snow-bound'', and \"The Eternal Goodness\".

Frequently listed as one of the [[fireside poets]], he was influenced by the Scottish poet [[Robert Burns]]. Whittier is remembered particularly for his anti-slavery writings as well as his book ''[[Snow-Bound]]''.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life and work===\nJohn Greenleaf Whittier was born to John and Abigail (Hussey) at their [[John Greenleaf Whittier Homestead|rural homestead]] in [[Haverhill, Massachusetts]], on December 17, 1807.<ref>Wagenknecht, 3</ref> His middle name is thought to mean 'feuillevert' after his [[Hugenot|Huguenot]] forebears.<ref>Pickard T. Samuel, Life and Letters of John Greenleaf Whittier , Haskell House Publishers, New York , 1907 , SBN 8383-0191-6</ref> He grew up on the farm in a household with his parents, a brother and two sisters, a maternal aunt and paternal uncle, and a constant flow of visitors and hired hands for the farm. As a boy, it was discovered that Whittier was [[color blindness|color-blind]] when he was unable to see a difference between ripe and unripe [[strawberry|strawberries]].<ref>Wagenknecht, 18</ref> Their farm was not very profitable and there was only enough money to get by. Whittier himself was not cut out for hard farm labor and suffered from bad health and physical frailty his whole life. Although he received little formal education, he was an avid reader who studied his father's six books on Quakerism until their teachings became the foundation of his ideology. Whittier was heavily influenced by the doctrines of his religion, particularly its stress on humanitarianism, compassion, and social responsibility.\n\nWhittier was first introduced to poetry by a teacher. His sister sent his first poem, \"The Exile's Departure\", to the [[Newburyport, Massachusetts|Newburyport]] ''Free Press'' without his permission and its editor, [[William Lloyd Garrison]], published it on June 8, 1826.<ref>Wagenknecht, 5</ref> Garrison as well as another local editor encouraged Whittier to attend the recently opened Haverhill Academy. To raise money to attend the school, Whittier became a shoemaker for a time, and a deal was made to pay part of his tuition with food from the family farm.<ref>Woodwell, 12</ref> Before his second term, he earned money to cover tuition by serving as a teacher in a one-room schoolhouse in what is now [[Merrimac, Massachusetts]].<ref>Woodwell, 17</ref> He attended Haverhill Academy from 1827 to 1828 and completed a high school education in only two terms.\n\nGarrison gave Whittier the job of editor of the ''National Philanthropist'', a Boston-based [[temperance movement|temperance]] weekly. Shortly after a change in management, Garrison reassigned him as editor of the weekly ''American Manufacturer'' in Boston.<ref>Woodwell, 25</ref> Whittier became an out-spoken critic of President [[Andrew Jackson]], and by 1830 was editor of the prominent ''New England Weekly Review'' in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], the most influential [[United States Whig Party|Whig]] journal in [[New England]]. He published ''[[The Song of the Vermonters, 1779]]'' anonymously in ''The New England Magazine'' in 1838.  The poem was mistakenly attributed to [[Ethan Allen]] for nearly sixty years.  Whittier acknowledged his authorship in 1858.\n\n===Abolitionist activity===\n[[File:Our Countrymen in Chains.jpg|thumb|Broadside publication of Whittier's ''Our Countrymen in Chains'']]\n\nDuring the 1830s, Whittier became interested in politics but, after losing a Congressional election at age twenty-five, he suffered a nervous breakdown and returned home. The year 1833 was a turning point for Whittier; he resurrected his correspondence with Garrison, and the passionate abolitionist began to encourage the young Quaker to join his cause.\n\nIn 1833, Whittier published the antislavery pamphlet ''Justice and Expediency'',<ref>Wagenknecht, 13</ref> and from there dedicated the next twenty years of his life to the abolitionist cause. The controversial pamphlet destroyed all of his political hopes \u2014 as his demand for immediate emancipation alienated both Northern businessmen and Southern slaveholders \u2014 but it also sealed his commitment to a cause that he deemed morally correct and socially necessary. He was a founding member of the [[American Anti-Slavery Society]] and signed the Anti-Slavery Declaration of 1833, which he often considered the most significant action of his life.\n\nWhittier's political skill made him useful as a lobbyist, and his willingness to badger anti-slavery congressional leaders into joining the abolitionist cause was invaluable. From 1835 to 1838, he traveled widely in the North, attending conventions, securing votes, speaking to the public, and lobbying politicians. As he did so, Whittier received his fair share of violent responses, being several times mobbed, stoned, and run out of town. \n\nFrom 1838 to 1840, he was editor of the ''[[National Enquirer (1836)|Pennsylvania Freeman]]'' in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]],<ref name=Wagenknecht6>Wagenknecht, 6</ref> one of the leading antislavery papers in the North, formerly known as the ''[[National Enquirer (1836)|National Enquirer]]''. In May 1838, the publication moved its offices to the newly opened [[Pennsylvania Hall (Philadelphia)|Pennsylvania Hall]] on North Sixth Street, which was shortly after burned by a pro-slavery mob.<ref>{{cite book\n|last1=Ehrlich\n|first1=Eugene\n|first2=Gorton\n|last2=Carruth\n|title=The Oxford Illustrated Literary Guide to the United States\n|location=New York\n|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]\n|year=1982\n|page=[https://archive.org/details/oxfordillustrate00euge/page/206 206]\n|isbn=0-19-503186-5\n|url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordillustrate00euge/page/206\n}}</ref> Whittier also continued to write poetry and nearly all of his poems in this period dealt with the problem of slavery.\n\nIn 1838 [[Charles G. Atherton]] presented five resolutions which were adopted, and which created a new resolution that barred Congress from discussing petitions which mentioned bringing slavery to an end. Congress approved them on December 12, 1838. This became known as the \u201cAtherton Gag\u201c.  Whittier referred to Atherton in one of his many abolitionists poems as \u201cvile\u201d, by having  allied himself so closely with fellow  Democrats from pro-slavery Southern States. <ref>{{cite book|title=Arguing about Slavery: John Quincy Adams and the Great Battle in the United States by William Lee Miller|access-date=January 16, 2020 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=bKk_DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA342&lpg=PA342&dq=slave.atherton#v=onepage&q=Atherton%20slimy&f=fakes|isbn=9780679768449 |last1=Miller |first1=William Lee |year=1998 }}</ref>\nIt was not until 1844 the House rescinded this gag rule on a motion made by [[John Quincy Adams]].\n\nBy the end of the 1830s, the unity of the abolitionist movement had begun to fracture. Whittier stuck to his belief that moral action apart from political effort was futile. He knew that success required legislative change, not merely moral suasion. This opinion alone engendered a bitter split from Garrison,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Corps|first1=Terry|title=The A to Z of the Jacksonian Era and Manifest Destiny|date=2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Latham, MD|isbn=978-0810868502|pages=343\u201344|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7Vl-FkztfacC&pg=PA343&dq=whittier+split+garrison#v=onepage&q=whittier%20split%20garrison&f=false|accessdate=4 February 2018}}</ref> and Whittier went on to become a founding member of the [[Liberty Party (1840s)|Liberty Party]] in 1839.<ref name=Wagenknecht6/> In 1840 he attended the [[World Anti-Slavery Convention]] in London.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/60228328?loginSuccess=true&seq=3#page_scan_tab_contents List of delegates], Anti-Slavery Convention 1840, Retrieved 3 August 2015</ref> By 1843, he was announcing the triumph of the fledgling party: \"Liberty party is no longer an experiment. It is vigorous reality, exerting ... a powerful influence\".<ref>Laurie, 59</ref> Whittier also unsuccessfully encouraged [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] to join the party.<ref>Laurie, 60</ref> He took editing jobs with the ''Middlesex Standard'' in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]], and the ''Essex Transcript'' in Amesbury until 1844.<ref name=Wagenknecht6/> While in Lowell, he met [[Lucy Larcom]], who became a lifelong friend.<ref>Ehrlich, Eugene and Gorton Carruth. ''The Oxford Illustrated Literary Guide to the United States''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1982: 51. {{ISBN|0-19-503186-5}}</ref>\n\nIn 1845, he began writing his essay \"The Black Man\" which included an anecdote about John Fountain, a free black who was jailed in Virginia for helping slaves escape. After his release, Fountain went on a speaking tour and thanked Whittier for writing his story.<ref>Laurie, 77</ref>\n\nAround this time, the stresses of editorial duties, worsening health, and dangerous mob violence caused him to have a physical breakdown. Whittier went home to Amesbury, and remained there for the rest of his life, ending his ''active'' participation in abolition. Even so, he continued to believe that the best way to gain abolitionist support was to broaden the Liberty Party's political appeal, and Whittier persisted in advocating the addition of other issues to their platform. He eventually participated in the evolution of the Liberty Party into the [[Free Soil Party]], and some say his greatest political feat was convincing [[Charles Sumner]] to run on the Free-Soil ticket for the U.S. Senate in 1850.\n\nBeginning in 1847, Whittier was editor of [[Gamaliel Bailey|Gamaliel Bailey's]] ''The National Era'',<ref name=Wagenknecht6/> one of the most influential abolitionist newspapers in the North. For the next ten years it featured the best of his writing, both as prose and poetry. Being confined to his home and away from the action offered Whittier a chance to write better abolitionist poetry; he was even poet laureate for his party. Whittier's poems often used slavery to represent all kinds of oppression (physical, spiritual, economic), and his poems stirred up popular response because they appealed to feelings rather than logic.\n\nWhittier produced two collections of antislavery poetry: ''Poems Written during the Progress of the Abolition Question in the United States, between 1830 and 1838'' and ''Voices of Freedom'' (1846). He was an [[Electoral College (United States)|elector]] in the [[1860 United States presidential election|presidential election of 1860]] and [[1864 United States presidential election|of 1864]], voting for [[Abraham Lincoln]] both times.<ref name=Wagenknecht8>Wagenknecht, 8</ref>\n\nThe passage of the Thirteenth Amendment in 1865 ended both slavery and his public cause, so Whittier turned to other forms of poetry for the remainder of his life.\n\n===Later life===\n[[File:Whittier John Greenleaf grave.jpg|thumb|left|Grave of John Greenleaf Whittier in Amesbury, MA]]\nWhittier was one of the founding contributors of the magazine ''[[The Atlantic|Atlantic Monthly]]''.\n\nOne of his most enduring works, ''[[Snow-Bound]]'', was first published in 1866. Whittier was surprised by its financial success; he earned $10,000 from the first edition.<ref name=Wagenknecht7>Wagenknecht, 7</ref> In 1867, Whittier asked [[James Thomas Fields]] to get him a ticket to a reading by [[Charles Dickens]] during the British author's visit to the United States. After the event, Whittier wrote a letter describing his experience:\n\n{{quote|My eyes ached all next day from the intensity of my gazing. I do not think his voice naturally particularly fine, but he uses it with great effect. He has wonderful dramatic power ... I like him better than any public reader I have ever before heard.<ref>Wagenknecht, 108\u2013109</ref>}}\n\nWhittier spent the last winters of his life, from 1876 to 1892, at Oak Knoll, the home of his cousins in [[Danvers, Massachusetts]].<ref>Ehrlich, Eugene and Gorton Carruth. ''The Oxford Illustrated Literary Guide to the United States''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1982: 46. {{ISBN|0-19-503186-5}}</ref> Whittier spent the summer of 1892 at the home of a cousin in [[Hampton Falls, New Hampshire]], where he wrote his last poem (a tribute to [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.]]) and where he was captured in a final photograph.<ref>Ehrlich, Eugene and Gorton Carruth.

Barber Obelisk (Pioneer Cemetery, Lawrence, KS).jpg|thumb|John Greenleaf Whittier's poem, ''Burial of Barber'' was inspired by the burial of abolitionist T. W. Barber (Barber's tomb pictured in 2018).]]\n\nWhittier's first two published books were ''Legends of New England'' (1831) and the poem ''[[Moll Pitcher]]'' (1832). In 1833 he published ''[[The Song of the Vermonters, 1779]],'' which he had anonymously inserted in ''The New England Magazine.'' The poem was erroneously attributed to [[Ethan Allen]] for nearly sixty years. This use of poetry in the service of his political beliefs is illustrated by his book ''Poems Written during the Progress of the Abolition Question''.\n\nHighly regarded in his lifetime and for a period thereafter, he is now largely remembered for his anti-slavery writings and his poems ''[[s:Barbara Frietchie|Barbara Frietchie]]'', \"[[The Barefoot Boy]]\", \"[[Maud Muller]]\" and ''Snow-Bound''.\n\nA number of his poems have been turned into [[hymn]]s, including ''[[Dear Lord and Father of Mankind]]'', taken from his poem \"[[Dear Lord and Father of Mankind#The Brewing of Soma|The Brewing of Soma]]\". The latter part of the poem was set in 1924 by Dr. George Gilbert Stocks to the tune of ''Repton'' by English composer [[Hubert Parry]] from the 1888 oratorio ''Judith''. It is also sung as the hymn ''Rest'' by Frederick Maker, and [[Charles Ives]] also set a part of it to music in his song \"Serenity\". On its own, the hymn appears sentimental, though in the context of the entire poem, the stanzas make greater sense, being intended as a contrast with the fevered spirit of pre-Christian worship and that of some modern Christians.\n\nWhittier's Quakerism is better illustrated,{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} however, by the hymn that begins:\n\n{{poemquote|\nO Brother Man, fold to thy heart thy brother:\nWhere pity dwells, the peace of God is there;\nTo worship rightly is to love each other,\nEach smile a hymn, each kindly deed a prayer.\n}}\n\nHis sometimes contrasting sense of the need for strong action against injustice can be seen in his poem \"To R\u00f6nge\" in honor of [[Johannes Ronge]], the German religious figure and rebel leader of the 1848 rebellion in Germany:\n\n{{poemquote|\nThy work is to hew down. In God's name then:\nPut nerve into thy task. Let other men;\nPlant, as they may, that better tree whose fruit,\nThe wounded bosom of the Church shall heal.\n}}\n\nWhittier's poem \"At Port Royal 1861\" describes the experience of Northern abolitionists arriving at [[Battle of Port Royal|Port Royal, South Carolina]], as teachers and missionaries for the slaves who had been left behind when their owners fled because the [[Union Navy]] would arrive to blockade the coast. The poem includes the \"Song of the Negro Boatmen,\" written in dialect:\n\n{{poemquote|\nOh, praise an' tanks! De Lord he come\nTo set de people free;\nAn' massa tink it day ob doom,\nAn' we ob jubilee.\nDe Lord dat heap de Red Sea waves\nHe jus' as 'trong as den;\n\nHe say de word: we las' night slaves;\nTo-day, de Lord's freemen.\nDe yam will grow, de cotton blow,\nWe'll hab de rice an' corn:\nOh, nebber you fear, if nebber you hear\nDe driver blow his horn!\n}}\n\nOf all the poetry inspired by the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the \"Song of the Negro Boatmen\" was one of the most widely printed,<ref name=\"Epstein\">{{cite book| last = Epstein | first = Dena | year =2003 | title =Sinful Tunes and Spirituals: Black Folk Music to the Civil War | publisher =University of Illinois Press| location = Chicago }}</ref> and though Whittier never actually visited Port Royal, an abolitionist working there described his \"Song of the Negro Boatmen\" as \"wonderfully applicable as we were being rowed across Hilton Head Harbor among United States gunboats.\"<ref name=\"McKim\">{{cite journal | last = McKim\n | first = Lucy | title = Songs of the Port Royal 'Contrabands' | journal = Dwight's Journal of Music | volume = 21 | pages = 254\u201355 | date = November 8, 1862 | accessdate = }}</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\n[[File:John Greenleaf Whittier Home - Amesbury, Massachusetts.JPG|thumb|The [[John Greenleaf Whittier Home]] in [[Amesbury, Massachusetts]]]]\n\n[[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] dismissed Whittier's ''Literary Recreations and Miscellanies'' (1854): \"Whittier's book is poor stuff! I like the man, but have no high opinion either of his poetry or his prose.\"<ref>Woodwell, 252</ref> Editor [[George Ripley (transcendentalist)|George Ripley]], however, found Whittier's poetry refreshing and said it had a \"stately movement of versification, grandeur of imagery, a vein of tender and solemn pathos, cheerful trust\" and a \"pure and ennobling character\".<ref>Crowe, Charles. ''George Ripley: Transcendentalist and Utopian Socialist''. Athens, GA: University of Georgia Press, 1967: 247.</ref> Boston critic [[Edwin Percy Whipple]] noted Whittier's moral and ethical tone mingled with sincere emotion. He wrote, \"In reading this last volume, I feel as if my soul had taken a bath in holy water.\"<ref>Woodwell, 443\u2013444</ref> Later scholars and critics questioned the depth of Whittier's poetry.

He was especially influential on prose writings by Jewett, with whom he shared a belief in the moral quality of literature and an interest in New England folklore. Jewett dedicated one of her books to him and modeled several of her characters after people in Whittier's life.<ref>Blanchard, Paula. ''Sarah Orne Jewett: Her World and Her Work''.

Both [[Whittier College]] and [[Whittier Law School]] are also named after him. A park in the Saint Boniface area of Winnipeg is named after the poet in recognition of his poem \"The Red River Voyageur\". Whittier Education Campus in Washington, DC, is named in his honor. [[SS Whittier Victory|SS ''Whittier Victory'']] a World War 2 ship named after Whittier College. [[Whittier Peak]] in Washington and [[Mount Whittier]] in New Hampshire are mountains named after him.\n\nThe [[alternate history]] story ''[[P.'s Correspondence]]'' (1846) by [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], considered the first such story ever published in English, includes the notice \"Whittier, a fiery Quaker youth, to whom the muse had perversely assigned a battle-trumpet, got himself lynched, in South Carolina\". The date of that event in Hawthorne's invented timeline was 1835.\n\nWhittier was one of thirteen writers in the 1897 card game [[Authors (card game)|Authors]], which referenced his writings \"Laus Deo\", \"Among the Hills\", ''Snow-bound'', and \"The Eternal Goodness\".
