Designed for [[Longitudinal engine|longitudinal]] placement in such vehicles as the [[Toyota Celica|Celica]] and [[Toyota Hilux|Hilux]] and in production from 1953 through 1997, usage faded out as many of Toyota's mainstream models moved to front-wheel drive. [[Overhead camshaft engine|Overhead cam (OHC)]] versions featured a chain-driven [[camshaft]].\n\n==History of the R family==\n\n===R===\n[[File:1953 Toyota R Type engine.jpg|thumb|1953 Toyota R engine.]]\n\nThe {{convert|1453|cc|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} '''R''' family was produced from 1953 through 1964, and was originally manufactured at the [[Toyota Honsha plant]].\n\nBore and stroke was {{convert|77x78|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"RT20parts\">Corona 1500 Parts Catalog, No.53282-67</ref> In common with new engines of the time, it was made from cast iron (both the block and the head), water cooled, used a three [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearing]] crank, 12V electrics and a side-mounted gear-driven [[camshaft]] controlling [[overhead valve]]s via pushrods in a [[Reverse-flow cylinder head|non-cross flow]] head (exhaust and [[inlet manifold]]s being on the same side of the engine).<ref name=\"RT20parts\"/> Induction was by a twin throat down-draft [[carburettor]], the [[compression ratio]] was 8.0:1 and the total weight was {{convert|155|kg|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"RT20parts\"/> An [[Autogas|LPG]] version, the '''R-LPG''', was produced for the last two years.\n\nThe R engine was the Toyota engine used in the 1958 [[Toyota Crown]], the first model to be exported to the United States. ''[[Road & Track]]'' was unimpressed with the engine on its introduction, noting that it idled quietly but was \"not capable of very high revolutions per minute.\"\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Many parts from the newer '''22R/R-E''' are not compatible with those from the older pre-1985 engine. Non-compatible parts include the cylinder head, block, pistons and many of the associated parts such as the timing chain and cover, and water and oil pumps (although the oil pump internals are the same).\nThese changes also affected the 22R, therefore one can consider the 85\u201395 22R-E as a fuel injected version of the 85\u201390 22R with only minor differences, if any.\n\nToyota swapped the dual-row timing chain used in older engines for a single-row chain with plastic guides in 1983. The new system reduced drag on the engine but introduced a new maintenance problem. After about {{convert|100000|mi|km|0}} of operation, the chain may stretch to the point that the hydraulic-operated chain tensioner cannot take up any more slack. The timing chain then impacts the plastic driver's side chain guide, breaking it within a short period of time and creating a noticeable chattering sound in the front of the engine, especially when cold. If the engine continues to be operated without the guide restraint, the chain will vibrate excessively on the driver's side and stretch rapidly. The result is any of several failure modes.\n\nFirst, the loose chain will reduce ignition timing accuracy, which usually results in noticeably rough running. Second, it may jump a tooth on the drive sprocket or break entirely, which almost always results in major damage to an [[interference engine]]. Third, the stretched chain can slap against the side of the timing cover and wear through the metal into the coolant passage behind the water pump, resulting in major damage to both the oil and cooling systems (sometimes mis-diagnosed as a head gasket failure). The damaged aluminum timing cover is difficult to repair effectively and is typically replaced after such an event. Aftermarket timing-chain kits for the 22R/R-E typically include steel-backed guides that do not readily break even after the initial chain stretching has occurred, permitting the chain to run beyond the {{convert|100000|mi|km|0}} point without further incident. However, some Toyota mechanics will recommend the plastic guides as they will break when the timing chain is stretched; When the guides break a noticeable chatter is heard from the timing chain slapping on the cover, warning the operator of a worn timing chain.\n\nThe [[turbocharged]] '''22R-TE''' (sold from late 1985 through 1988) produced {{convert|101|kW|hp PS|abbr=on}} at 4,800&nbsp;rpm and {{convert|234|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 2,800&nbsp;rpm.\n\nThese engines are extremely well known for their durability, decent fuel efficiency and good low to mid range torque.\n\nHowever, its weakness is high-end power. The '''22R''' has a large displacement and a strong block, but its comparatively long stroke and restrictive head limit its use in high revving applications. Thus, the Toyota [[Toyota R engine#18R-G|18R-G]], [[Toyota T engine#2T-G|2T-G]], [[Toyota 4A-GE|4A-GE]] and [[Toyota S engine#3S-GE|3S-GE]] 4-cylinder engines are better suited for performance applications.\n\nA popular modification to the early 22R is to use a 20R head. Unlike popular lore, the 20R head does not have smaller combustion chambers. The misunderstanding originated when the 22R came out and an advantage was its higher compression ratio, so swapping a 20R block with a 22R, there was a compression increase. The 20R head has straight ports, so can flow better than the 22R head, improving high RPM power. The 20R head is a simple bolt-on modification for the pre-1985 block, but also requires the use of the 20R intake manifold, making it almost impossible (there's a lot of matching necessary) to use with the 22R-E EFI system.<ref name=\"toysport\">{{cite web|url=http://www.toysport.com/technical%20information/22r_tech_notes.htm|title=Toysport \u2013 22R Tech Notes|accessdate=2009-10-07|year=2000|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111044404/http://www.toysport.com/Technical%20Information/22r_tech_notes.htm|archivedate=2010-01-11}}</ref> For blocks 1985 and onwards, further modifications are required.<ref name=\"lcengineering20r22r\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lcengineering.com/LCTechPages/techpages/eng17.html|title=LC Engineering \u2013 Using a 20R Head on an 85\u201395 22RE Block|accessdate=2009-10-07|year=2004}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Many parts from the newer '''22R/R-E''' are not compatible with those from the older pre-1985 engine. Non-compatible parts include the cylinder head, block, pistons and many of the associated parts such as the timing chain and cover, and water and oil pumps (although the oil pump internals are the same).\nThese changes also affected the 22R, therefore one can consider the 85-95 22R-E as a fuel injected version of the 85-90 22R with only minor differences, if any.\n\nToyota swapped the dual-row timing chain used in older engines for a single-row chain with plastic guides in 1983. The new system reduced drag on the engine but introduced a new maintenance problem. After about {{convert|100000|mi|km|0}} of operation, the chain may stretch to the point that the hydraulic-operated chain tensioner cannot take up any more slack. The timing chain then impacts the plastic driver's side chain guide, breaking it within a short period of time and creating a noticeable chattering sound in the front of the engine, especially when cold. If the engine continues to be operated without the guide restraint, the chain will vibrate excessively on the driver's side and stretch rapidly. The result is any of several failure modes.\n\nFirst, the loose chain will reduce ignition timing accuracy, which usually results in noticeably rough running. Second, it may jump a tooth on the drive sprocket or break entirely, which almost always results in major damage to an [[interference engine]]. Third, the stretched chain can slap against the side of the timing cover and wear through the metal into the coolant passage behind the water pump, resulting in major damage to both the oil and cooling systems (sometimes mis-diagnosed as a head gasket failure). The damaged aluminum timing cover is difficult to repair effectively and is typically replaced after such an event. Aftermarket timing-chain kits for the 22R/R-E typically include steel-backed guides that do not readily break even after the initial chain stretching has occurred, permitting the chain to run beyond the {{convert|100000|mi|km|0}} point without further incident. However, some Toyota mechanics will recommend the plastic guides as they will break when the timing chain is stretched; When the guides break a noticeable chatter is heard from the timing chain slapping on the cover, warning the operator of a worn timing chain.\n\nThe [[turbocharged]] '''22R-TE''' (sold from late 1985 through 1988) produced {{convert|101|kW|hp PS|abbr=on}} at 4,800&nbsp;rpm and {{convert|234|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 2,800&nbsp;rpm.\n\nThese engines are extremely well known for their durability, decent fuel efficiency and good low to mid range torque.\n\nHowever, its weakness is high-end power. The '''22R''' has a large displacement and a strong block, but its comparatively long stroke and restrictive head limit its use in high revving applications. Thus, the Toyota [[Toyota R engine#18R-G|18R-G]], [[Toyota T engine#2T-G|2T-G]], [[Toyota 4A-GE|4A-GE]] and [[Toyota S engine#3S-GE|3S-GE]] 4-cylinder engines are better suited for performance applications.\n\nA popular modification to the early 22R is to use a 20R head. Unlike popular lore, the 20R head does not have smaller combustion chambers. The misunderstanding originated when the 22R came out and an advantage was its higher compression ratio, so swapping a 20R block with a 22R, there was a compression increase. The 20R head has straight ports, so can flow better than the 22R head, improving high RPM power. The 20R head is a simple bolt-on modification for the pre-1985 block, but also requires the use of the 20R intake manifold, making it almost impossible (there's a lot of matching necessary) to use with the 22R-E EFI system.<ref name=\"toysport\">{{cite web|url=http://www.toysport.com/technical%20information/22r_tech_notes.htm|title=Toysport - 22R Tech Notes|accessdate=2009-10-07|year=2000|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111044404/http://www.toysport.com/Technical%20Information/22r_tech_notes.htm|archivedate=2010-01-11}}</ref> For blocks 1985 and onwards, further modifications are required.<ref name=\"lcengineering20r22r\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lcengineering.com/LCTechPages/techpages/eng17.html|title=LC Engineering - Using a 20R Head on an 85-95 22RE Block|accessdate=2009-10-07|year=2004}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
