There are also seminaries for older adults who are well out of school, such as the [[Pope St. John XXIII National Seminary]] in Massachusetts, and for other more specialized purposes.\n\nAll seminaries are run either by [[religious order]]s or by [[diocese]]s or other similar structures.  Often a seminary will train both that particular order's or diocese's priests and the priests of other orders or dioceses that select that particular seminary for its priests.  For instance, [[Saint John's Seminary (Massachusetts)|Saint John's Seminary]] in Boston, Massachusetts trains priests for many of the other dioceses in New England which are [[suffragan diocese]]s of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston]].

For instance the [[Theological College (The Catholic University of America)|Theological College]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] is part of [[The Catholic University of America]].\n\nFurther, in Rome there are several seminaries which educate seminarians or already ordained priests and bishops and which are maintained by orders or dioceses from outside of Italy.

He was bought up by his mother Winifred, a violinist, with help from his Godmother Mary Gotch, also a musician. He became a chorister at [[New College Oxford]], attended [[Worksop College]] (studying piano and cello) and then at the Birmingham and Midland School of Music (now the [[Royal Birmingham Conservatoire]]) between 1944 and 1946 for clarinet and composition.<ref name=jan>'Composer & Conductor Christopher Whelen' posted by ''Janice in Caunes''</ref> After two years with the [[RAF]] for his National Service Whelen secured conducting lessons with the Austrian \u00e9migr\u00e9 [[Rudolf Schwarz (conductor)|Rudolf Schwarz]].<ref name=grove>[https://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/grovemusic/view/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.001.0001/omo-9781561592630-e-5000002933?rskey=IuTaiD Palmer, Christopher.

''Bax: A Composer and His Times'' (1983)</ref> A correspondence began in 1947, which led to a lifelong friendship. Around 40 of the letters have been published. In 1951 Whelen conducted Bax's Sixth Symphony in Bournemouth. Bax wrote: \"I still dote on your performance of No 6 and want a repeat\".<ref name=tempo>Scott-Sutherland, Colin. 'Review, Cuchulan Among the Guns' in ''Tempo'' No 2015, January 2001, p 34-5</ref> Through Bax Whelen also met the pianist [[Harriet Cohen]], who became a supporter. He was awarded the [[Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge]] medal for conducting in 1955.<ref name=jan/>\n\nHowever, from 1951 Whelen became musical director at the [[Old Vic Theatre]] in London and most of his conducting commitments were dropped. While there (and from 1955 at other theatres as well) he produced much incidental music for [[Shakespeare]] and other productions.<ref>''Shakespeare Quarterly'', Vol 7 No 1 (Winter 1956), p 85-6</ref> He composed the music  for [[John Osborne]]'s ''[[The World of Paul Slickey]]'' (1959). This was Osborne's only attempt to write a musical. But after the huge successes of his previous plays ''[[Look Back in Anger]]'' and ''[[The Entertainer (play)|The Entertainer]],'' the play was to become \"one of the most spectacular disasters in English theatre\".<ref>Heilpern, John, ''John Osborne: A Patriot for Us'', 2007, Random House, pp.249-54</ref> Despite this setback, the theatre work led to a series of commissions by the [[BBC]] spanning the 1960s to the 1980s for radio productions with original music, including television and radio operas as well as hard to classify music dramas for which Whelen typically wrote both the words and music, fusing the music and action together.\n\nWhelen met his lifelong partner Dennis Andrews in 1948 in Bournemouth They lived together for many years in [[Cumnor]], Oxfordshire before Whelen's death in 1993.<ref name=jan/> The Christopher Whelen Award for innovation in music in film and theatre was set up in his name. Winners include Paddy Cunneen, [[Jonathan Dove]], [[Andy Price]] and Mick Sands.\n\n==Music==\nWhelen was primarily a music dramatist and his most successful works are the series of radio and television music theatre works commissioned by the BBC starting from the 1960s. His first operatic production, broadcast on 6 August 1961, was ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'', for which he contributed new arrangements of the traditional ballads.<ref>[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/99c092c336a44340a92d70876927b3e5 ''Radio Times'' Issue 1969, 3 August 1961, p 16]</ref> The original radio opera ''The Cancelling Dark'', with text by the poet [[Vernon Scannell]], followed on 5 December 1965.<ref>[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/56c3c8cc4c014d2a934bbe460e3ca918 ''Radio Times'' Issue 2195, 2 December 1965, p 22]</ref> The action alternates between a crashed aircraft in the African jungle near [[Benguela]] and the radio control room at [[Kakonda]] Airfield.

He became a priest in 1776 and served in that capacity in Ireland for more than four decades. After the Pope declined to appoint him [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Armagh|Archbishop of Armagh]], the diocese in which he served as Vicar General, he was instead installed as the second [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia|Bishop of Philadelphia]] in 1819. Conwell took up the post at an advanced age, and spent much of his time there feuding with the lay trustees of his parishes, especially those of [[St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church (Philadelphia)|St. Mary's Church]] in Philadelphia. When Conwell removed and excommunicated [[William Hogan (priest)|William Hogan]], a controversial priest at St. Mary's, the parish trustees instead rejected Conwell's authority, creating a minor schism. The two sides partially reconciled by 1826, but the Vatican hierarchy believed Conwell had ceded too much power to the laymen in the process, and recalled him to Rome. Although he retained his position, Conwell was compelled to relinquish actual control to his [[coadjutor bishop]], [[Francis Kenrick]]. He remained in Philadelphia and performed some priestly duties, but for all practical purposes no longer ran the diocese. He died there in 1842 at the age of about 94.\n\n==Early life and priesthood==\nConwell was born about 1748 in [[Moneymore]], [[County Londonderry]], Ireland (present-day [[Northern Ireland]]), the son of Owen Conwell and his wife, Mary (Keegan) Conwell.{{efn|Earlier sources give Conwell's date of birth as about 1745, but an Irish researcher, Brother Luke of De La Salle Monastery in [[Muine Bheag]], later discovered evidence that it was likely 1748.{{sfn|Luke|1940|pp=291\u2013292}}}}{{sfn|Luke|1940|pp=291\u2013292}}{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=162}} He studied at the [[Irish College in Paris]] and was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] to the priesthood there in November 1776.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=162}}{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=86}} Conwell was well-educated, being fluent in Latin, French, Spanish, and Italian, but had a reputation as a preacher of only modest ability.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=166}} Around 1785, he contemplated moving to the United States but was concerned about the still uncertain financial state of the new country's parishes, and ultimately decided not to apply for a position there.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=86}} He was appointed [[parish priest]] of [[Dungannon]] in 1792 or 1793 and [[Vicar General]] of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Armagh|Archdiocese of Armagh]] in 1794.{{sfn|Luke|1940|pp=291\u2013292}}{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} After the death of Archbishop [[Richard O'Reilly]] in 1818, Conwell served as acting Archbishop.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=163}}\n\n==Bishop of Philadelphia==\n===Ordination===\nMany of the clergy who served under him in Armagh recommended that the Pope appoint Conwell to head the diocese permanently.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=163}} Some opposed him, accusing him of being frequently absent from his parish to visit France and Scotland.{{sfn|MacAuley|1982|pp=342\u2013343}} The British government also objected, favoring [[Patrick Curtis]] instead, as they saw him as more friendly to their interests.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=163}} The Vatican agreed,{{Failed verification|date=April 2020}} and [[Pope Pius VII]] appointed Curtis to Armagh, offering Conwell instead a choice of the [[Episcopal see|sees]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia|Philadelphia]] or [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Madras and Mylapore|Madras]]; Conwell chose Philadelphia.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=163}} Now more than 70 years old, he was ordained bishop in London on September 24, 1819, by Bishop [[William Poynter]], the [[Vicar Apostolic of the London District]], assisted by Fathers [[James Bramston (bishop)|James Bramston]] and [[Joseph Francis Carpue]].{{efn|Although three bishops are typically required for ordination, the Pope may issue a dispensation when co-consecrators are unavailable.{{sfn|Code of Canon Law}} }}{{sfn|Bransom|1990|p=13}}\n\nThe see of Philadelphia had been vacant since the death of Bishop [[Michael Francis Egan]] in 1814, despite several efforts to fill it.{{sfn|Shea|1886|p=156}} Archbishop [[John Carroll (bishop)|John Carroll]] of Baltimore, whose [[Ecclesiastical province|province]] included Philadelphia, had considered no fewer than fifteen priests for the position; some had been ruled out for one reason or another, and others (including the apostolic administrator, [[Louis de Barth]]) had turned the job down.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|pp=80\u201381}} Part of the delay was logistical\u2014Carroll was unsure of the exact procedure for selecting a candidate in the recently erected province\u2014but part was due to the perceived undesirability of the post, which oversaw only a few small churches in a part of the nation with few Catholics.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|pp=80\u201381}} There was also a significant dispute (known as [[trusteeism]]) over the rights of churches' [[Laity|lay]] trustees that was likely to complicate the job of running the diocese. In Europe, the Church owned property and directly controlled its parishes through the clergy. In the United States, however, early Catholic churches were typically founded by laymen who purchased the property, and erected the church buildings. Those laypeople accordingly demanded some control over the administration of the parish, even after the arrival of clergy from Europe who held the traditional view of parish organization.{{sfn|Carey|1978|pp=357\u2013358}} In a larger sense, the dispute represented a difference in understandings of authority between Americans and Europeans.{{sfn|Hessinger|2011|p=368}}\n\n===Hogan schism===\n[[File:Old St. Mary's Church.jpg|thumb|[[St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church (Philadelphia)|St. Mary's Church]] in Philadelphia was the epicenter of the disputes that overshadowed Conwell's episcopate.]]\nConwell arrived in [[Philadelphia]] on December 2, 1820.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} The trusteeism dispute had only grown more bitter during the vacancy preceding his arrival. Shortly before Conwell reached the diocese, a priest, [[William Hogan (priest)|William Hogan]], approached de Barth (then administering the diocese until a bishop was appointed) about securing an assignment to preach in Philadelphia.{{sfn|Griffin|1913|pp=23\u201324}} After only a cursory investigation of his past, de Barth agreed, and Hogan was assigned to [[St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church (Philadelphia)|St. Mary's Church]].{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=91}} Hogan quickly ingratiated himself with the laymen who made up the board of trustees, siding with them in their dispute with the other clergy.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=91}} Hogan's other behavior created tension between him and Conwell. When Conwell arrived, Hogan had already moved out of the priests' residence at [[Old St. Joseph's Church]] to a house across the street, claiming that the original accommodations were poor; his detractors said he used the private residence to entertain women. The situation became public when Hogan announced from the pulpit one Sunday that neither Conwell nor anyone else had the right to say where he should live.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=91}}\n\nLater that week, Conwell called a meeting of the city's priests and announced that Hogan was suspended.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=91}} The St. Mary's trustees took Hogan's side, while Conwell condemned the trustees as \"despicable ex-Catholics\" and \"the worst sort of [[Jacobin]]s\".{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=92}} In the meantime, Conwell recalled a [[Dominican Order|Dominican friar]]\u2014William Vincent Harold, whom his predecessor had dismissed\u2014to assist him.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} The St. Mary's trustees had quarreled with Harold in the past, and his recall increased their mistrust of Conwell.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=93}} The schism continued as St. Mary's refused to recognize Conwell's authority over them or Hogan, explicitly excluding Conwell from their board and electing Hogan in his place. Since they had rebelled against the Church hierarchy, Conwell declared Hogan [[Excommunication (Catholic Church)|excommunicated]] in a public statement on May 27, 1821.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=94}}\n\nIn 1822, Conwell showed his support for Harold by appointing him as Vicar General of the diocese.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=93}} The Hogan schism took on new dimensions, however, when Hogan was charged with rape and battery.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=95}} Philadelphia mayor [[Robert Wharton (Philadelphia)|Robert Wharton]] presided over the trial, which captured the city's attention.{{sfn|Hessinger|2011|pp=357\u2013359}} Although the jury found him not guilty, Hogan's image was harmed.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=95}} A letter from the Pope sided with Conwell but, after initially agreeing to leave the diocese, Hogan reversed himself and stayed on.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=99}} The pro-Hogan faction prevailed at St. Mary's trustee elections that year amid bloody rioting between parish members.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=95}} The next year, 1823, some Hogan supporters convinced a local woman to bring a paternity suit against Conwell, but the charges were dismissed quickly and the complainant was convicted of [[perjury]].{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=95}} In an 1824 letter to the ''[[National Gazette]],'' Hogan proposed the creation of an \"American Catholic Church\" with more independence from Rome.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=97}}\n\nBy this time, Hogan had begun to lose the trustees' support.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=97}} At some point soon thereafter, he left the city.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=99}} In the hope of healing the schism, in October 1826 Conwell partially capitulated to the trustees, yielding to them the right of determining salaries and of vetoing his appointments.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} In return, they recognized him as bishop and senior pastor of the church.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=100}} The bishop would henceforth appoint St. Mary's pastor, but the trustees would be permitted to arbitrate any disagreements on appointments before a neutral board.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=100}}\n\n===Recall to Rome===\nThe trustees soon renounced the agreement. When word of the compromise reached the [[Holy See]], the Vatican also objected, condemning Conwell's surrender of episcopal rights. Harold, writing to Rome, claimed that Conwell had had little to do with the compromise, which he blamed on Father [[Michael Hurley (19th-century priest)|Michael Hurley]] and Conwell's Protestant lawyer, Josiah Randall.{{efn|Josiah Randall would soon become the father of [[Samuel J. Randall]], a future [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]].{{sfn|House|1934|pp=1\u20135}} }}{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=101}} Conwell saw Harold's conduct as a betrayal, and removed him as Vicar General, appointing Hurley in his place.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=101}} The trustees put aside their former enmity for Harold and took his side against Conwell, going so far as to petition Rome for Conwell's removal as bishop.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=101}} By this time, as Arthur Ennis wrote in 1976, the \"old and confused\" Conwell considered leaving the diocese if he could secure another see in Ireland.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=102}} In 1827, the Vatican's ''[[Propaganda Fide]]'' formally rejected Conwell's pact with the trustees, condemning Hurley's role in the process, as well.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=102}} They summoned Conwell to Rome.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}}\n\n[[Ambrose Mar\u00e9chal]], who was now Archbishop of Baltimore, was ordered to oversee the diocese in Conwell's absence, and he appointed a priest from his diocese, [[William Matthews (priest)|William Matthews]], as apostolic administrator.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=103}} Conwell sailed for Rome on July 12, 1828.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=104}} Once there, Conwell was ordered to give a report of all that had transpired. While forbidden to return to his diocese, he was promised that after a full explanation, he would be permitted to reside anywhere in Europe.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=104}} He left Rome secretly in 1829, and when his absence was discovered, the Pope decreed he would be suspended from office if he returned to Philadelphia.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=104}} Conwell did return to Philadelphia, however, in October of that year, and traveled from there to Baltimore, where the [[Provincial Councils of Baltimore|First Provincial Council of Baltimore]] was in session.{{sfn|Shea|1886|p=156}}\n\n===Retirement===\n[[File:2013 Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul from across the Benjamin Franklin Parkway 2.jpg|thumb|Conwell is buried in the crypt of the [[Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul (Philadelphia)|Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul]] along with most other bishops of Philadelphia.]]\nIn Baltimore, Conwell professed his obedience to Rome and swore he would gladly retire from active governance of his diocese.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=104}} The following year, the Vatican appointed [[Francis Kenrick]] as Conwell's [[coadjutor bishop]] with the right of succession and named him administrator of the diocese.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=104}} Conwell never gave up his titles or his claim to exercise authority in the diocese, and his relationship with Kenrick remained rocky.{{sfn|Barr|2008|p=615}} He received permission to resume performing [[liturgy|liturgical]] functions without any say in administration, and spent his remaining years in seclusion and prayer.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} He lived on for several years, although he lost his sight, preventing him from performing most of his few remaining duties.{{sfn|Shea|1886|p=156}}\n\nConwell died on April 22, 1842, at about the age of 94.{{sfn|Nolan|1976|p=163}} Kenrick succeeded to the title of bishop of Philadelphia.

He became a priest in 1776 and served in that capacity in Ireland for more than four decades. After the Pope declined to appoint him [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Armagh|Archbishop of Armagh]], the diocese in which he served as Vicar General, he was instead installed as the second [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia|Bishop of Philadelphia]] in 1819. Conwell took up the post at an advanced age, and spent much of his time there feuding with the lay trustees of his parishes, especially those of [[St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church (Philadelphia)|St. Mary's Church]] in Philadelphia. When Conwell removed and excommunicated [[William Hogan (priest)|William Hogan]], a controversial priest at St. Mary's, the parish trustees instead rejected Conwell's authority, creating a minor schism. The two sides partially reconciled by 1826, but the Vatican hierarchy believed Conwell had ceded too much power to the laymen in the process, and recalled him to Rome. Although he retained his position, Conwell was compelled to relinquish actual control to his [[coadjutor bishop]], [[Francis Kenrick]]. He remained in Philadelphia and performed some priestly duties, but for all practical purposes no longer ran the diocese. He died there in 1842 at the age of about 94.\n\n==Early life and priesthood==\nConwell was born about 1748 in [[Moneymore]], [[County Londonderry]], Ireland (present-day [[Northern Ireland]]), the son of Owen Conwell and his wife, Mary (Keegan) Conwell.{{efn|Earlier sources give Conwell's date of birth as about 1745, but an Irish researcher, Brother Luke of De La Salle Monastery in [[Muine Bheag]], later discovered evidence that it was likely 1748.{{sfn|Luke|1940|pp=291\u2013292}}}}{{sfn|Luke|1940|pp=291\u2013292}}{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=162}} He studied at the [[Irish College in Paris]] and was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] to the priesthood there in November 1776.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=162}}{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=86}} Conwell was well-educated, being fluent in Latin, French, Spanish, and Italian, but had a reputation as a preacher of only modest ability.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=166}} Around 1785, he contemplated moving to the United States but was concerned about the still uncertain financial state of the new country's parishes, and ultimately decided not to apply for a position there.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=86}} He was appointed [[parish priest]] of [[Dungannon]] in 1792 or 1793 and [[Vicar General]] of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Armagh|Archdiocese of Armagh]] in 1794.{{sfn|Luke|1940|pp=291\u2013292}}{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} After the death of Archbishop [[Richard O'Reilly]] in 1818, Conwell served as acting Archbishop.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=163}}\n\n==Bishop of Philadelphia==\n===Ordination===\nMany of the clergy who served under him in Armagh recommended that the Pope appoint Conwell to head the diocese permanently.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=163}} Some opposed him, accusing him of being frequently absent from his parish to visit France and Scotland.{{sfn|MacAuley|1982|pp=342\u2013343}} The British government also objected, favoring [[Patrick Curtis]] instead, as they saw him as more friendly to their interests.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=163}} The Vatican agreed,{{Failed verification|date=April 2020}} and [[Pope Pius VII]] appointed Curtis to Armagh, offering Conwell instead a choice of the [[Episcopal see|sees]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia|Philadelphia]] or [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Madras and Mylapore|Madras]]; Conwell chose Philadelphia.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=163}} Now more than 70 years old, he was ordained bishop in London on September 24, 1819, by Bishop [[William Poynter]], the [[Vicar Apostolic of the London District]], assisted by Fathers [[James Bramston (bishop)|James Bramston]] and [[Joseph Francis Carpue]].{{efn|Although three bishops are typically required for ordination, the Pope may issue a dispensation when co-consecrators are unavailable.{{sfn|Code of Canon Law}} }}{{sfn|Bransom|1990|p=13}}\n\nThe see of Philadelphia had been vacant since the death of Bishop [[Michael Francis Egan]] in 1814, despite several efforts to fill it.{{sfn|Shea|1886|p=156}} Archbishop [[John Carroll (bishop)|John Carroll]] of Baltimore, whose [[Ecclesiastical province|province]] included Philadelphia, had considered no fewer than fifteen priests for the position; some had been ruled out for one reason or another, and others (including the apostolic administrator, [[Louis de Barth]]) had turned the job down.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|pp=80\u201381}} Part of the delay was logistical\u2014Carroll was unsure of the exact procedure for selecting a candidate in the recently erected province\u2014but part was due to the perceived undesirability of the post, which oversaw only a few small churches in a part of the nation with few Catholics.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|pp=80\u201381}} There was also a significant dispute (known as [[trusteeism]]) over the rights of churches' [[Laity|lay]] trustees that was likely to complicate the job of running the diocese. In Europe, the Church owned property and directly controlled its parishes through the clergy. In the United States, however, early Catholic churches were typically founded by laymen who purchased the property, and erected the church buildings. Those laypeople accordingly demanded some control over the administration of the parish, even after the arrival of clergy from Europe who held the traditional view of parish organization.{{sfn|Carey|1978|pp=357\u2013358}} In a larger sense, the dispute represented a difference in understandings of authority between Americans and Europeans.{{sfn|Hessinger|2011|p=368}}\n\n===Hogan schism===\n[[File:Old St. Mary's Church.jpg|thumb|[[St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church (Philadelphia)|St. Mary's Church]] in Philadelphia was the epicenter of the disputes that overshadowed Conwell's episcopate.]]\nConwell arrived in [[Philadelphia]] on December 2, 1820.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} The trusteeism dispute had only grown more bitter during the vacancy preceding his arrival. Shortly before Conwell reached the diocese, a priest, [[William Hogan (priest)|William Hogan]], approached de Barth (then administering the diocese until a bishop was appointed) about securing an assignment to preach in Philadelphia.{{sfn|Griffin|1913|pp=23\u201324}} After only a cursory investigation of his past, de Barth agreed, and Hogan was assigned to [[St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church (Philadelphia)|St. Mary's Church]].{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=91}} Hogan quickly ingratiated himself with the laymen who made up the board of trustees, siding with them in their dispute with the other clergy.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=91}} Hogan's other behavior created tension between him and Conwell. When Conwell arrived, Hogan had already moved out of the priests' residence at [[Old St. Joseph's Church]] to a house across the street, claiming that the original accommodations were poor; his detractors said he used the private residence to entertain women. The situation became public when Hogan announced from the pulpit one Sunday that neither Conwell nor anyone else had the right to say where he should live.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=91}}\n\nLater that week, Conwell called a meeting of the city's priests and announced that Hogan was suspended.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=91}} The St. Mary's trustees took Hogan's side, while Conwell condemned the trustees as \"despicable ex-Catholics\" and \"the worst sort of [[Jacobin]]s\".{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=92}} In the meantime, Conwell recalled a [[Dominican Order|Dominican friar]]\u2014William Vincent Harold, whom his predecessor had dismissed\u2014to assist him.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} The St. Mary's trustees had quarreled with Harold in the past, and his recall increased their mistrust of Conwell.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=93}} The schism continued as St. Mary's refused to recognize Conwell's authority over them or Hogan, explicitly excluding Conwell from their board and electing Hogan in his place. Since they had rebelled against the Church hierarchy, Conwell declared Hogan [[Excommunication (Catholic Church)|excommunicated]] in a public statement on May 27, 1821.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=94}}\n\nIn 1822, Conwell showed his support for Harold by appointing him as Vicar General of the diocese.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=93}} The Hogan schism took on new dimensions, however, when Hogan was charged with rape and battery.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=95}} Philadelphia mayor [[Robert Wharton (Philadelphia)|Robert Wharton]] presided over the trial, which captured the city's attention.{{sfn|Hessinger|2011|pp=357\u2013359}} Although the jury found him not guilty, Hogan's image was harmed.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=95}} A letter from the Pope sided with Conwell but, after initially agreeing to leave the diocese, Hogan reversed himself and stayed on.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=99}} The pro-Hogan faction prevailed at St. Mary's trustee elections that year amid bloody rioting between parish members.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=95}} The next year, 1823, some Hogan supporters convinced a local woman to bring a paternity suit against Conwell, but the charges were dismissed quickly and the complainant was convicted of [[perjury]].{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=95}} In an 1824 letter to the ''[[National Gazette]],'' Hogan proposed the creation of an \"American Catholic Church\" with more independence from Rome.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=97}}\n\nBy this time, Hogan had begun to lose the trustees' support.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=97}} At some point soon thereafter, he left the city.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=99}} In the hope of healing the schism, in October 1826 Conwell partially capitulated to the trustees, yielding to them the right of determining salaries and of vetoing his appointments.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} In return, they recognized him as bishop and senior pastor of the church.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=100}} The bishop would henceforth appoint St. Mary's pastor, but the trustees would be permitted to arbitrate any disagreements on appointments before a neutral board.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=100}}\n\n===Recall to Rome===\nThe trustees soon renounced the agreement. When word of the compromise reached the [[Holy See]], the Vatican also objected, condemning Conwell's surrender of episcopal rights. Harold, writing to Rome, claimed that Conwell had had little to do with the compromise, which he blamed on Father [[Michael Hurley (19th-century priest)|Michael Hurley]] and Conwell's Protestant lawyer, Josiah Randall.{{efn|Josiah Randall would soon become the father of [[Samuel J. Randall]], a future [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]].{{sfn|House|1934|pp=1\u20135}} }}{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=101}} Conwell saw Harold's conduct as a betrayal, and removed him as Vicar General, appointing Hurley in his place.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=101}} The trustees put aside their former enmity for Harold and took his side against Conwell, going so far as to petition Rome for Conwell's removal as bishop.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=101}} By this time, as Arthur Ennis wrote in 1976, the \"old and confused\" Conwell considered leaving the diocese if he could secure another see in Ireland.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=102}} In 1827, the Vatican's ''[[Propaganda Fide]]'' formally rejected Conwell's pact with the trustees, condemning Hurley's role in the process, as well.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=102}} They summoned Conwell to Rome.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}}\n\n[[Ambrose Mar\u00e9chal]], who was now Archbishop of Baltimore, was ordered to oversee the diocese in Conwell's absence, and he appointed a priest from his diocese, [[William Matthews (priest)|William Matthews]], as apostolic administrator.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=103}} Conwell sailed for Rome on July 12, 1828.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=104}} Once there, Conwell was ordered to give a report of all that had transpired.

He studied at SMP Negeri 5 Bandung and SMAK BPK Bandung. He continued his studies at Sekolah Tinggi Publisistik and then Institut Kesenian Jakarta. At the age of thirteen, he appeared as a street musician in small wedding ceremonies and other social events.<ref>{{harvnb|Ubaedy|Ratrioso|2005|pp=1\u20132}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nWhile he was 18, Iwan Fals, Toto Gunarto, Helmi, Bambang Bule and Kakek Jagonk formed a group named Amburadul. The group released the album 'Perjalanan' in 1979, which was not successful, but was re-released with the added track '3 Bulan' as '3 Bulan' (1980) in 1980. The group disbanded and played no further role in Iwan Fals' career.\n\nAs part of his early career, Iwan Fals also recorded some comedy albums, after winning a comedy country singing contest. He sang of comic situations and themes, and his first release was on 'Canda Dalam Nada' (the A-side featured five songs by Iwan: Generasi Frustrasi, Dongeng Tidur, Imitasi, Kisah Sepeda Motorku (aka. Kopral), and Joni Kesiangan while the B-side consisted of songs by Tom Slepe and Pusaka Jaya). The songs Dongeng Tidur, Joni Kesiangan and Kisah Sepeda Motorku were released, with one new song, Ambulance Zig Zag, on the Iwan Fals mini-album Canda Dalam Nada, while Generasi Frustrasi and Imitasi were also included on the 'Yang Muda Yang Bercanda II' multiartist comedy compilation.\n\nDuring this time, Iwan supported himself by busking.\n\n1981 saw Iwan Fals' breakthrough, when he signed to Musica Studio to record his first solo album, ''[[Sarjana Muda]]''. This album shows Iwan Fals' signature country music style, with the protest song \"Guru Oemar Bakrie\", which talks of how a teacher is poorly paid but still responsible for educating future well-paid and successful people. 'Guru Oemar Bakrie' became very well known and popular in Indonesia, and helped established Iwan's name. The album also contains several ballads. It benefited from considerable investment by Musica Studio, who used high-quality musicians and producer for the album.\n\n1982's Opini, also on Musica Studio, cemented Iwan's reputation as a protest singer, but also as a balladeer. 'Galang Rambu Anarki', for his newborn son, combined both elements, commenting on both the happy event of the birth of his first child, but also commenting on rising prices, saying that perhaps his child would be malnourished if they could not afford to buy milk.\n\n1983 saw the release of ''Sumbang'', while 1984's album releases were ''Barang Antik'' and ''Sugali''.\n\nIn April 1984, Iwan was arrested and questioned for two weeks after performing the songs 'Demokrasi Nasi' and ''Mbak Tini'', both songs never recorded on album, in [[Pekanbaru]]. The song Mbak Tini was about a prostitute with a road-side coffee shop, married to 'Soeharyo' ([[Suharto]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rollingstone.co.id/read/2011/02/08/182515/1563366/1093/iwan-fals-berterimakasih-kepada-orde-baru-dan-mengagumi-soeharto |title=Iwan Fals Berterimakasih Kepada Orde Baru dan Mengagumi Soeharto |accessdate=2012-02-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120714153523/http://rollingstone.co.id/read/2011/02/08/182515/1563366/1093/iwan-fals-berterimakasih-kepada-orde-baru-dan-mengagumi-soeharto |archivedate=2012-07-14 |df= }}</ref> The events were retold on the song '14-4-84' on 1986's Ethiopia.\n\nIwan Fals continued to release albums throughout the 1980s, while in 1989 he formed the group ''Swami'', which released two albums ''Swami I'' in 1989, and ''Swami II'' in 1991. A similar grouping was ''Kantata Takwa'', which contained several Swami personnel. The musical style was \"rebana rock\", a blend of [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[Rick Wakeman]], to a Betawi rebana.<ref>{{harvnb|Sen|Hill|2000|p=182}}</ref> The album ''Kantata Takwa'' was released in 1990, featuring songs such as \"Bento\" and \"Bongkar\" (\"Rip It Down\"), two of several songs which they sang during a demonstration by college students.<ref name=\"aning96\">{{harvnb|Aning S.|2006|p=96}}</ref>\n\nUp to the release ''Orang Gila'' in 1994, Iwan had released approximately two new albums per year for 15 years.

''Manusia Setengah Dewa'', in 2004, was a solo album.\n\nIn 2005, he released ''Iwan Fals In Love'', essentially a compilation of existing Iwan Fals romantic recordings, but with the new song \"Ijinkan Aku Menyayangimu\" (\"Let Me Love You\") as the main single, and five re-recordings of old songs.<ref name=\"klc\"/> Two songs, in collaboration with Indra Lesmana, ''Haruskah Pergi'', and ''Selancar'', were released as digital download in 2006.\n\nIn 2007, ''50:50'' was released by Musica Studios. The album's themes were romance and social criticism. One single of the album, \"Pulanglah\" (\"Go Home\"), tells about the death of [[Munir Said Thalib|Munir]].<ref>{{harvnb|Ginting|2009|pp=289\u2013291}}</ref> Six singles were written by himself and other six singles were written by his fellow musicians.<ref name=\"klc\"/> Two songs were released in 2009 as ''Untukmu Terkasih''.\n\nIn 2010, he released ''Keseimbangan'', and in 2011 he released a new album titled \"Tergila-gila\" with 4 new songs inside.\n\n=== OI ===\nHe has a large fan club which is called ''OI'' (stylised as lowercase ''oi)'', he stated \"''Oi'' is not [actually] Orang Indonesia, so there are many friends (fans) whose faces I recognise, but [I] can't remember their names.\" He started calling his fans who often come to his house to listen his free acoustic live performance with \"Oi\" which literally means \"Hey\".<ref>{{Citation|last=Taufik Rahaji|title=Iwan Fals Akhirnya Bicara - Kick Andy - FULL|date=2013-06-15|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aTyziIi7Dk|accessdate=2018-05-09}}</ref> Thus, the fans derived ''OI'' as the name of the fan club and made it as an abbreviation from ''Orang Indonesia'' (''Indonesian People'') as the acronym must contain a meaning. The idea of naming ''Orang Indonesia'' came from Iwan Fals' foundation, ''Yayasan Orang Indonesia'' (''Indonesian People Foundation'').

In 2002, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine named him as a Great Asian Hero.\n\n==Early life==\nIwan was born Virgiawan Listanto in Jakarta, on 3 September 1961 to Harsoyo, a soldier,<ref name=\"ginting286\"/> and Lies Suudijah. He studied at SMP Negeri 5 Bandung and SMAK BPK Bandung. He continued his studies at Sekolah Tinggi Publisistik and then Institut Kesenian Jakarta. At the age of thirteen, he appeared as a street musician in small wedding ceremonies and other social events.<ref>{{harvnb|Ubaedy|Ratrioso|2005|pp=1\u20132}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nWhile he was 18, Iwan Fals, Toto Gunarto, Helmi, Bambang Bule and Kakek Jagonk formed a group named Amburadul. The group released the album 'Perjalanan' in 1979, which was not successful, but was re-released with the added track '3 Bulan' as '3 Bulan' (1980) in 1980. The group disbanded and played no further role in Iwan Fals' career.\n\nAs part of his early career, Iwan Fals also recorded some comedy albums, after winning a comedy country singing contest. He sang of comic situations and themes, and his first release was on 'Canda Dalam Nada' (the A-side featured five songs by Iwan: Generasi Frustrasi, Dongeng Tidur, Imitasi, Kisah Sepeda Motorku (aka. Kopral), and Joni Kesiangan while the B-side consisted of songs by Tom Slepe and Pusaka Jaya). The songs Dongeng Tidur, Joni Kesiangan and Kisah Sepeda Motorku were released, with one new song, Ambulance Zig Zag, on the Iwan Fals mini-album Canda Dalam Nada, while Generasi Frustrasi and Imitasi were also included on the 'Yang Muda Yang Bercanda II' multiartist comedy compilation.\n\nDuring this time, Iwan supported himself by busking.\n\n1981 saw Iwan Fals' breakthrough, when he signed to Musica Studio to record his first solo album, ''[[Sarjana Muda]]''. This album shows Iwan Fals' signature country music style, with the protest song \"Guru Oemar Bakrie\", which talks of how a teacher is poorly paid but still responsible for educating future well-paid and successful people. 'Guru Oemar Bakrie' became very well known and popular in Indonesia, and helped established Iwan's name. The album also contains several ballads. It benefited from considerable investment by Musica Studio, who used high-quality musicians and producer for the album.\n\n1982's Opini, also on Musica Studio, cemented Iwan's reputation as a protest singer, but also as a balladeer. 'Galang Rambu Anarki', for his newborn son, combined both elements, commenting on both the happy event of the birth of his first child, but also commenting on rising prices, saying that perhaps his child would be malnourished if they could not afford to buy milk.\n\n1983 saw the release of ''Sumbang'', while 1984's album releases were ''Barang Antik'' and ''Sugali''.\n\nIn April 1984, Iwan was arrested and questioned for two weeks after performing the songs 'Demokrasi Nasi' and ''Mbak Tini'', both songs never recorded on album, in [[Pekanbaru]]. The song Mbak Tini was about a prostitute with a road-side coffee shop, married to 'Soeharyo' ([[Suharto]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rollingstone.co.id/read/2011/02/08/182515/1563366/1093/iwan-fals-berterimakasih-kepada-orde-baru-dan-mengagumi-soeharto |title=Iwan Fals Berterimakasih Kepada Orde Baru dan Mengagumi Soeharto |accessdate=2012-02-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120714153523/http://rollingstone.co.id/read/2011/02/08/182515/1563366/1093/iwan-fals-berterimakasih-kepada-orde-baru-dan-mengagumi-soeharto |archivedate=2012-07-14 |df= }}</ref> The events were retold on the song '14-4-84' on 1986's Ethiopia.\n\nIwan Fals continued to release albums throughout the 1980s, while in 1989 he formed the group ''Swami'', which released two albums ''Swami I'' in 1989, and ''Swami II'' in 1991. A similar grouping was ''Kantata Takwa'', which contained several Swami personnel. The musical style was \"rebana rock\", a blend of [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[Rick Wakeman]], to a Betawi rebana.<ref>{{harvnb|Sen|Hill|2000|p=182}}</ref> The album ''Kantata Takwa'' was released in 1990, featuring songs such as \"Bento\" and \"Bongkar\" (\"Rip It Down\"), two of several songs which they sang during a demonstration by college students.<ref name=\"aning96\">{{harvnb|Aning S.|2006|p=96}}</ref>\n\nUp to the release ''Orang Gila'' in 1994, Iwan had released approximately two new albums per year for 15 years.

'Galang Rambu Anarki' translates to \"support the sign of anarchy\" in English.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.planetmole.org/daily/indonesians-in-focus-iwan-fals.html|title=Indonesians in Focus: Iwan Fals|work=planetmole.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://suaramerdeka.com/v1/index.php/read/cetak/2010/04/22/106730/Dapat-Julukan-Kiai-dari-Santri-Rembang|title=SUARA MERDEKA CETAK - Dapat Julukan Kiai dari Santri Rembang|author=Suara Merdeka CyberNews|work=suaramerdeka.com|access-date=2012-02-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100425003809/http://suaramerdeka.com/v1/index.php/read/cetak/2010/04/22/106730/Dapat-Julukan-Kiai-dari-Santri-Rembang|archive-date=2010-04-25|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 1985, Fals' first daughter Annisa Cikal Rambu Basae was born.<ref name=\"ubaedy3\">{{harvnb|Ubaedy|Ratrioso|2005|p=3}}</ref> His third child is Rayya Rambu Robbani.<ref name=\"klc\">{{cite web |url=http://selebriti.kapanlagi.com/indonesia/i/iwan_fals/ |title=Iwan Fals |work=KapanLagi.com |accessdate=8 October 2011}}</ref> He and Rosanna, his wife live in [[Cibubur]], [[West Java]].<ref name=\"aning96\"/>\n\n==Discography==\n* Perjalanan (as part of Amburadul group) (1979)\n* Canda Dalam Nada (1979) - comedy album, Iwan has the A-side only\n* Canda Dalam Ronda (1980) - comedy mini-album of four tracks, contains one new track 'Ambulance Zig Zag'\n* 3 Bulan (consists of Perjalanan plus the new track ''3 Bulan'') (1980)\n* [[Sarjana Muda]] (1981) - Musica debut\n* [[Opini]] (1982)\n* [[Sumbang]] (1983)\n* [[Barang Antik]] (1984)\n* [[Sugali (Iwan Fals album)|Sugali]] (1984)\n* [[Kelompok Penyanyi Jalanan]] (KPJ) - as part of KPJ, or Street Singers Group, Iwan Fals sings on 3 songs (1985)\n* [[Sore Tugu Pancoran]] (1985)\n* [[Aku Sayang Kamu]] (1986)\n* [[Ethiopia (Iwan Fals album)|Ethiopia]] (1986)\n* [[Lancar]] (1987)\n* [[Wakil Rakyat]] (1987)\n* 1910 (1988)\n* [[Kemesraan]] (1988) - single, with Betharia Sonata, [[Chrisye]], Rafika Duri, Itang, [[Jamal Mirdad]], Etrie, Nani\n* [[Mata Dewa]] (1989)\n* [[Swami I]] (as part of the group Swami) (1989)\n* [[Kantata Takwa]] (as part of the group Kantata) (1990)\n* [[Cikal]] (1991)\n* [[Swami II]] (as part of the group Swami)  (1991)\n* [[Belum Ada Judul]] (1992)\n* [[Hijau]] (1992)\n* [[Dalbo (Iwan Fals album)|Dalbo]] (1993)\n* [[Anak Wayang]] (1994)\n* [[Orang Gila]] (1994)\n* [[Kantata Samsara]] (as part of the group Kantata) (1998)\n* [[Suara Hati]] (2002)\n* [[In Collaboration with]] (2003)\n* [[Manusia Setengah Dewa]] (2004)\n* [[In Love (Iwan Fals album)|In Love]] (2005) (contains only one new song, and four re-recordings)\n* [[50:50]] (2007)\n* [[Untukmu Terkasih]] (2009) - [[Mini-album]] - two songs only\n* [[Keseimbangan]] (2010)\n* [[Tergila-gila]] (2011)\n* Raya (2013)\n\n==Awards==\nIn 2002, he was named as Great Asian Hero by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.<ref name=\"ubaedy4\"/> In 2011, he received \"Satyalancana\", the highest government awards from [[Jero Wacik]], Culture and Tourism Minister of Indonesia.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/03/24/pop-singer-iwan-fals-receives-highest-government-award-dedication.html |title=Pop singer Iwan Fals receives highest government award for dedication |date=24 March 2011 |newspaper=The Jakarta Post |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111013081501/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/03/24/pop-singer-iwan-fals-receives-highest-government-award-dedication.html |archivedate=13 October 2011 |df= }}</ref> \n\nRolling Stone Indonesia listed Swami's song Bongkar as the best Indonesian song of all time and Bento on the fifth position, Kantata Takwa's Kesaksian on 81st position, and Iwan Fals' solo Guru Oemar Bakrie, Yang Terlupakan, Surat Buat Wakil Rakyat, Pesawat Tempur, Galang Rambu Anarki, and Sarjana Muda on 5th, 42nd, 51st, 56th, 65th, and 97th, respectively, making him the second musician with the most representative on the chart after [[Koes Plus]] with the margin of one.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |title=100 Tokoh Yang Mengubah Indonesia |last=Aning S. |first=Floriberta |year=2006 |publisher=Narasi |location=Yogyakarta |isbn=9789797564759 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XLrkTdG_9xEC |edition=Revised |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |title=Indonesia Beyond Suharto: Polity, Economy, Society, Transition |last=Emmerson |first=Donald K. |year=1999 |publisher=M.
