{"title_page": "Justice delayed is justice denied", "text_new": "{{short description|Legal maxim}}\n'''\"Justice delayed is justice denied\"''' is a [[legal maxim]] meaning that if [[Legal remedy|legal redress]] or [[Equitable relief|equitable relief]] is available for a party that has suffered some injury, but is not forthcoming in a timely fashion, it is effectively the same as having no redress at all. This principle is the basis for the right to a [[speedy trial]] and similar rights which are meant to expedite the legal system, because it is unfair for the injured party to have to sustain the injury with little hope for resolution. The phrase has become a rallying cry for [[law reform|legal reformers]] who view [[court]]s or [[government]]s as acting too slowly in resolving legal issues either because the existing system is too complex or overburdened, or because the issue or party in question lacks political favour.  When a court takes a matter \"under advisement\" {{ndash}} awaiting the issuance of a [[judicial opinion]], [[Court order|order]] or [[judgement]] and forestalls [[Adjudication|adjudication]] {{ndash}} the issue of timeliness of the decision comes into play.\n\n==Origin==\nThere are conflicting accounts of who first noted the phrase.

''[[Patterson v. Alabama|Patterson v. State of Alabama]]'' [1934] 294 U.S. 600, illustrates this position. It is important that the party claiming the relief or change of relief must have the same right from which either the first or the modified remedy may flow. Subsequent events in the course of the case cannot be constitutive of substantive rights enforceable in that very litigation ... but may influence the equitable jurisdiction to mould reliefs. Conversely, where rights have already vested in a party, they cannot be nullified or negated by subsequent events save where there is a change in the law and it is made applicable at any stage. [Citation omitted] ... Courts of justice may, when the compelling equities of a case oblige them, shape reliefs - cannot deny rights - to make them justly relevant in the updated circumstances. Where the relief is discretionary, Courts may exercise this jurisdiction to avoid injustice. Likewise, where the right to the remedy depends, under the statute itself, on the presence or absence of certain basic facts at the time the relief is to be ultimately granted, the Court, even in appeal, can take note of such supervening facts with fundamental impact....Where a cause of action is deficient but later events have made up the deficiency, the Court may, in order to avoid multiplicity of litigation, permit amendment and continue the proceeding, provided no prejudice is caused to the other side.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.legalcrystal.com/case/639383/board-control-cricket-india-vs-netaji-club |title=Board of Control for Cricket, India and anr.

The estate's court case goes on for 12 years, for reasons no one understands, and the entire estate is itself dissipated in the battle.  As one writer notes:\n<blockquote>In the Victorian era, the Court of Chancery was a synonym of delay. In Bleak  House Dickens invented a fictional legal case named ''[[Jarndyce and Jarndyce]]'' in order to caricature the legal system of England, and the iniquity of Chancery chiefly takes the form of procrastination: \u201cJarndyce and Jarndyce drones on. This scarecrow of a suit has, in course of time, become so complicated,  that  no  man  alive  knows  what  it  means\u201d  (BH1  16).  As  a  consequence  of  this protraction, many characters involved in Jarndyce and Jarndyce are tortured by being held in painful anxiety\" one goes insand and another's mind is consumed with \u201ccorroding care, suspense, distrust, and doubt\u201d (BH 630).\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dickens.jp/archive/bh/bh-tsutsui.pdf|title=Delay and Suspense in Bleak House  |last1=Mizuki |first1=Tsutsui |format=PDF |accessdate=April 19, 2020}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the preface to ''Bleak House'', Dickens cites two Chancery cases as especial inspirations, one of which was a \"[[friendly suit]]\":\n\n{{Quote|text=At the present moment (August, 1853) there is a suit before the court which was commenced nearly twenty years ago, in which from thirty to forty counsel have been known to appear at one time, in which costs have been incurred to the amount of seventy thousand pounds, which is A FRIENDLY SUIT, and which is (I am assured) no nearer to its termination now than when it was begun.

''[[Patterson v. Alabama|Patterson v. State of Alabama]]'' [1934] 294 U.S. 600, illustrates this position. It is important that the party claiming the relief or change of relief must have the same right from which either the first or the modified remedy may flow. Subsequent events in the course of the case cannot be constitutive of substantive rights enforceable in that very litigation ... but may influence the equitable jurisdiction to mould reliefs. Conversely, where rights have already vested in a party, they cannot be nullified or negated by subsequent events save where there is a change in the law and it is made applicable at any stage. [Citation omitted] ... Courts of justice may, when the compelling equities of a case oblige them, shape reliefs - cannot deny rights - to make them justly relevant in the updated circumstances. Where the relief is discretionary, Courts may exercise this jurisdiction to avoid injustice. Likewise, where the right to the remedy depends, under the statute itself, on the presence or absence of certain basic facts at the time the relief is to be ultimately granted, the Court, even in appeal, can take note of such supervening facts with fundamental impact....Where a cause of action is deficient but later events have made up the deficiency, the Court may, in order to avoid multiplicity of litigation, permit amendment and continue the proceeding, provided no prejudice is caused to the other side.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.legalcrystal.com/case/639383/board-control-cricket-india-vs-netaji-club |title=Board of Control for Cricket, India and anr.

It ranged from [[Maine]] and [[southern Ontario]] to [[Mississippi]], and from the [[Atlantic]] coast to the [[Appalachian Mountains]] and the [[Ohio Valley]]. ''C. dentata'' was once one of the most common trees in the [[Northeastern United States]]. In [[Pennsylvania]] alone, it is estimated to have comprised 25\u201330% of all hardwoods. The tree's huge population was due to a combination of rapid growth and a large annual seed crop in comparison to oaks which do not reliably produce sizable numbers of acorns every year. Nut production begins when ''C. dentata'' is 7\u20138 years old.\n\nThere are several similar [[chestnut]] species, such as the European [[sweet chestnut]], [[Castanea mollissima|Chinese chestnut]], and [[Japanese chestnut]]. The American species can be distinguished by a few morphological traits, such as [[Glossary of leaf morphology|leaf shape]], [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]] length and nut size. For example, it has larger and more widely spaced saw-teeth on the edges of its leaves, as indicated by the scientific name ''dentata'', Latin for \"toothed\". According to a 1999 study by American Society for Horticultural Science, the [[Castanea ozarkensis|Ozark chinkapin]], which is typically considered either a distinct species (''C. ozarkensis'') or a subspecies of the [[Castanea pumila|Allegheny chinkapin]] (''C. pumila ozarkensis'') may be ancestral to both the American chestnut and the Allegheny chinkapin.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Huang|first=Hongwen|last2=Hawkins|first2=Leigh K.|last3=Dane|first3=Fenny|date=1999-11-01|title=Genetic Variation and Population Structure of Castanea pumila var. ozarkensis|journal=Journal of the American Society for Horticultural Science|language=en-US|volume=124|issue=6|pages=666\u2013670|doi=10.21273/JASHS.124.6.666|issn=2327-9788|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2019/06/saving-chestnut-trees-ozarks/|title=A legendary Ozark chestnut tree, thought extinct, is rediscovered|date=2019-06-24|website=Environment|access-date=2019-07-28}}</ref>\n\nThe [[leaf|leaves]], which are {{convert|14|\u2013|20|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|7|\u2013|10|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} broad, also tend to average slightly shorter and broader than those of the sweet chestnut. The [[Plant disease resistance|blight-resistant]] Chinese chestnut is now the most commonly planted chestnut species in the US, while the European chestnut is the source of commercial nuts in recent decades. It can be distinguished from the American chestnut by its hairy twig tips which are in contrast to the hairless twigs of the American chestnut. The chestnuts are in the beech family along with [[beech]] and [[oak]], but are not closely related to the horse-chestnut, which is in the family [[Sapindaceae]].\n\nThe chestnut is [[Plant reproductive morphology#Variations|monoecious]], producing many small, pale green (nearly white) male flowers found tightly occurring along 6 to 8 inch long [[catkin]]s. The female parts are found near base of the catkins (near twig) and appear in late spring to early summer. Like all members of the family [[Fagaceae]], American chestnut is self-incompatible and requires two trees for pollination, which can be any member of the Castanea genus.\n\nThe American chestnut is a prolific bearer of [[nut (fruit)|nuts]], usually with three nuts enclosed in each spiny, green burr, and lined in tan velvet. The nuts develop through late summer, with the burrs opening and falling to the ground near the first fall frost.\n\nThe American chestnut was a very important tree for wildlife, providing much of the fall [[mast (botany)|mast]] for species such as [[white-tailed deer]] and [[wild turkey]] and, formerly, the [[passenger pigeon]]. [[American black bear|Black bears]] were also known to eat the nuts to fatten up for the winter. The American chestnut also contains more [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[potassium]] and [[magnesium]] in its leaves when compared to other trees that share its habitat. This means they return more nutrients to the soil which helps with the growth of other plants, animals, and [[microorganism]]s.<ref name=blight>Jabr, Ferris.

John Rush Elkins, a research chemist and [[professor emeritus]] of chemistry at [[Concord University]], and Gary Griffin, professor of plant pathology at [[Virginia Tech]], think there may be several different characteristics which favor blight resistance. Both Elkins and Griffin have written extensively about the American chestnut.<ref name=griffin>[http://www.accf-online.org/biblio.html \"Bibliography.\"] ''www.accf-online.org.'' Retrieved January 11, 2016.</ref>  They believe that by making intercrosses among resistant American chestnuts from many locations, they will continue to improve upon the levels of blight resistance to make an American chestnut that can compete in the forest. Griffin, who has been involved with American chestnut restoration for many years,<ref name=griffin/> developed a scale for assessing levels of blight resistance, which made it possible to make selections scientifically. He inoculated five-year-old chestnuts with a standard lethal strain of the blight fungus and measured growth of the cankers. Chestnuts with no resistance to blight make rapid-growing, sunken cankers that are deep and kill tissue right to the wood. Resistant chestnuts make slow-growing, swollen cankers that are superficial: live tissue can be recovered under these cankers. The level of blight resistance is judged by periodic measurement of cankers. Grafts from large survivors of the blight epidemic were evaluated following inoculations, and controlled crosses among resistant American chestnut trees were made beginning in 1980. The first \"All-American intercrosses\" were planted in Virginia Tech's Martin American Chestnut Planting in [[Giles County, Virginia]], and in [[Beckley, West Virginia]]. They were inoculated in 1990 and evaluated in 1991 and 1992. Nine of the trees showed resistance equal to their parents, and four of these had resistance comparable to hybrids in the same test.<ref name=griffin/><ref name=elkins>Griffin, G.J., J.R. Elkins, D.

It ranged from [[Maine]] and [[southern Ontario]] to [[Mississippi]], and from the [[Atlantic]] coast to the [[Appalachian Mountains]] and the [[Ohio Valley]]. ''C. dentata'' was once one of the most common trees in the [[Northeastern United States]]. In [[Pennsylvania]] alone, it is estimated to have comprised 25\u201330% of all hardwoods. The tree's huge population was due to a combination of rapid growth and a large annual seed crop in comparison to oaks which do not reliably produce sizable numbers of acorns every year. Nut production begins when ''C. dentata'' is 7\u20138 years old.\n\nThere are several similar [[chestnut]] species, such as the European [[sweet chestnut]], [[Castanea mollissima|Chinese chestnut]], and [[Japanese chestnut]]. The American species can be distinguished by a few morphological traits, such as [[Glossary of leaf morphology|leaf shape]], [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]] length and nut size. For example, it has larger and more widely spaced saw-teeth on the edges of its leaves, as indicated by the scientific name ''dentata'', Latin for \"toothed\". According to a 1999 study by American Society for Horticultural Science, the [[Castanea ozarkensis|Ozark chinkapin]], which is typically considered either a distinct species (''C. ozarkensis'') or a subspecies of the [[Castanea pumila|Allegheny chinkapin]] (''C. pumila ozarkensis'') may be ancestral to both the American chestnut and the Allegheny chinkapin.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Huang|first=Hongwen|last2=Hawkins|first2=Leigh K.|last3=Dane|first3=Fenny|date=1999-11-01|title=Genetic Variation and Population Structure of Castanea pumila var. ozarkensis|journal=Journal of the American Society for Horticultural Science|language=en-US|volume=124|issue=6|pages=666\u2013670|doi=10.21273/JASHS.124.6.666|issn=2327-9788|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2019/06/saving-chestnut-trees-ozarks/|title=A legendary Ozark chestnut tree, thought extinct, is rediscovered|date=2019-06-24|website=Environment|access-date=2019-07-28}}</ref>\n\nThe [[leaf|leaves]], which are {{convert|14|\u2013|20|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|7|\u2013|10|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} broad, also tend to average slightly shorter and broader than those of the sweet chestnut. The [[Plant disease resistance|blight-resistant]] Chinese chestnut is now the most commonly planted chestnut species in the US, while the European chestnut is the source of commercial nuts in recent decades. It can be distinguished from the American chestnut by its hairy twig tips which are in contrast to the hairless twigs of the American chestnut. The chestnuts are in the beech family along with [[beech]] and [[oak]], but are not closely related to the horse-chestnut, which is in the family [[Sapindaceae]].\n\nThe chestnut is [[Plant reproductive morphology#Variations|monoecious]], producing many small, pale green (nearly white) male flowers found tightly occurring along 6 to 8 inch long [[catkin]]s. The female parts are found near base of the catkins (near twig) and appear in late spring to early summer. Like all members of the family [[Fagaceae]], American chestnut is self-incompatible and requires two trees for pollination, which can be any member of the Castanea genus.\n\nThe American chestnut is a prolific bearer of [[nut (fruit)|nuts]], usually with three nuts enclosed in each spiny, green burr, and lined in tan velvet. The nuts develop through late summer, with the burrs opening and falling to the ground near the first fall frost.\n\nThe American chestnut was a very important tree for wildlife, providing much of the fall [[mast (botany)|mast]] for species such as [[white-tailed deer]] and [[wild turkey]] and, formerly, the [[passenger pigeon]]. [[American black bear|Black bears]] were also known to eat the nuts to fatten up for the winter. The American chestnut also contains more [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[potassium]] and [[magnesium]] in its leaves when compared to other trees that share its habitat. This means they return more nutrients to the soil which helps with the growth of other plants, animals, and [[microorganism]]s.<ref name=blight>Jabr, Ferris.

Griffin, who has been involved with American chestnut restoration for many years,<ref name=griffin/> developed a scale for assessing levels of blight resistance, which made it possible to make selections scientifically. He inoculated five-year-old chestnuts with a standard lethal strain of the blight fungus and measured growth of the cankers. Chestnuts with no resistance to blight make rapid-growing, sunken cankers that are deep and kill tissue right to the wood. Resistant chestnuts make slow-growing, swollen cankers that are superficial: live tissue can be recovered under these cankers. The level of blight resistance is judged by periodic measurement of cankers. Grafts from large survivors of the blight epidemic were evaluated following inoculations, and controlled crosses among resistant American chestnut trees were made beginning in 1980. The first \"All-American intercrosses\" were planted in Virginia Tech's Martin American Chestnut Planting in [[Giles County, Virginia]], and in [[Beckley, West Virginia]]. They were inoculated in 1990 and evaluated in 1991 and 1992. Nine of the trees showed resistance equal to their parents, and four of these had resistance comparable to hybrids in the same test.<ref name=griffin/><ref name=elkins>Griffin, G.J., J.R. Elkins, D.
