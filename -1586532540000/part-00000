It comes under [[Jabalpur]] division.\n\nNarsinghpur has a large temple dedicated to [[Narasimha|Lord Narsingh]], constructed by [[Jat]] Sardars in the 18th century. The [[Khirwar]] [[clan]] of [[Jats]] came from [[Brij]] and founded Narsinghpur, where they ruled for many years. Khirwars of Narsinghpur were followers of [[Narasimha]], and so constructed two temples dedicated to [[Narasimha]] [[Avatar]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://narsinghpur.nic.in/profile.html|title=Official website of District Administration Narsinghpur|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> \n\nAs of 2001, Narsinghpur is the most literate district of the state.\n\n==History==\nIn 18 century the ruler of Narsinghpur Thakur ji was killed by British rulers and the fort of narsinghpur was totally destroyed. There are a number of sites of interest to archaeologists in the area, as the area has been inhabited since the second century AD, according to historical documents from that time. Narsinghpur has a number of sacred sites, including a nearby cave associated with Adi Guru Shankracharya's place of meditations and studies.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://narsinghpur.nic.in/history.html|title=Narsinghpur|website=narsinghpur.nic.in|access-date=2016-10-04}}</ref>\n\n===Satvahan period===\nThis area was under the rule of Satvahans from the second to fourth centuries AD, after which time it was under the Gupts when Samudra Gupt extended the borders of his kingdom. There is some historical evidence for Padi rule. There is no record of this area until the 9th century, when the Kalchuri kingdom was established. The Kalchuri capital was near the Narmada river, later established at Tripuri.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Raj Gond Vansh===\nAfter the establishment of Raj Gond Vansh, an era of peace and prosperity began in the area. This Vansh came to existence by Yadav Rao, who laid the foundation of a strong kingdom at a place called Garha\u2013Katanga and started a process of strong mighty rule. One of the rulers, [[Sangram Shah]] (1500\u20131541) had established 52 Garh, of the [[Gond Dynasty]]. The fort of [[Chauragarh]] (Chougan) at Narsinghpur was constructed by Sangram Shah, which is still an evidence of bravery of Veerarayan. He was son of Queen Rani Durgawati.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAmong the followers of Sangram Shah,  Dalpati Shah ruled for a period of 7 years peacefully. After, this Queen Durgawati took the reign and gave a proof of courage or bravery, and ruled for a period of 16 years (1540\u20141564). In 1564, the Queen died, while fighting bravely, giving a tough fight to Asaf Khan, the Sepoy Salar of King Akbar. In Narsinghpur district, at the castle fort of [[Chauragarh]], Asaf Khan trapped prince Veer Narayan and killed him with his cunning tactics. Thus Garha Katanga came under control of Mugals in 1564, Gonds Mugals. After then the area was under control of various officers and administrative or hereditary chiefs during the Maratha's rule. The boundaries of the area continued to change according to the powers and influence of their people. Chawarpatha, Barha, Saikheda, [[Gadarwara]], Shahpur, Singhpur, Shrinagar, and Tendukheda were headquarters of various [[pargana]]s\n\n===Bhonsle Rulers===\nIn 1785, Madhavji Bhonsle purchased the area of Mandla and Narmada Ghati in 27 [[lakh]]s. The area was under pressure of army rule during the reign of [[Raghuji Bhonsle]], Nawab of Bhopal and Pindari's. Due to unsuitability and other problems, the common people were extremely exploited. This period was also known as a period of problems and unsuitability. However, after the defeat of [[Bhosle]]s in [[Battle of Sitabuldi]] in 1817, British rule came into existence in the area.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===British period===\nAfter the Battle of Sitabuldi, this area came under the control of British rule in 1817, which was confirmed by an alliance in 1826. In this period the area was known as Gadarwara pargana, with Chichli and Gangai. The Gond Jagirs were under Marathas, where as Sindhiya had given Barha and Paloha Jagirs to Pindari Sardars, Chitu and Karim Khan. In 1818, the British army captured the fort of Chauragarh, and in 1830 the control of this area was given to a committee. During British rule, the Administration of this district was further improved, and in 1836 the area was partitioned and was merged in Hoshangabad district. But after Bundela revolt in 1843, this part was once again reinstated in this district.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Struggle for independence===\nDespite strong British rule, the desire for independence was prevalent among the common people. In 1825, Chawarpatha and Tendukheda were given to the British Government. In 1857 the police station of Chawarpatha and Tendukheda were captured by revolutionaries under the leadership of Gond Chief Delan Shah of Madanpur. With this, the struggle for independence was started. But in 1858, Delan Shah was caught and hanged to death. Thus in the year British curbed the struggle for independence, and they succeeded in establishing their rule.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Congress movement===\nAfter the establishment of Indian National Congress in 1885, even in this district, the feeling for Independence was prevalent. Strong efforts were made by the people here, being motivated by the efforts and leadership of [[Lokmanya Tilak]], [[Subhas Chandra Bose]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]], and [[Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru]]. Among the leaders of his district were Gayadutt, [[Manik Chand Lunawat]], Choudhary Shankar Lal, Raghunath Singh Kiledar, Mahendra singh Kiledar, Gopal Das Kathal, Thakur Niranjan Singh & Sri Shyam Sunder Narayan Musharan, who led the people of this district towards the Independence movements. In order to break the unity and enthusiasm of the people, the British had once again partitioned the district and merged it with [[Hoshangabad district]]. However, even then, enthusiasm as well as the fight for independence continued in the people's minds. During the mass demonstration of [[satyagrah]] at Chichli in 1932, Mansharam and Gauradevi lost their lives during police firing.\n\nThousands of revolutionaries faced the atrocities of British rule and gave an example of strong devotion for the country, and snipe against the British rule. When the country gained Independence in 1947, on 15 August, a new era started in this district. After 9 years of independence, when states were reorganized on the basis of languages, Narsinghpur, once again, became a district. Since 1 November 1956, Narsinghpur district has been moving towards progress and prosperity in its full existence.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Geography==\nNarsinghpur district is situated in the central part of Madhya Pradesh.

It comes under [[Jabalpur]] division.\n\nNarsinghpur has a large temple dedicated to [[Narasimha|Lord Narsingh]], constructed by [[Jat]] Sardars in the 18th century. The [[Khirwar]] [[clan]] of [[Jats]] came from [[Brij]] and founded Narsinghpur, where they ruled for many years. Khirwars of Narsinghpur were followers of [[Narasimha]], and so constructed two temples dedicated to [[Narasimha]] [[Avatar]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://narsinghpur.nic.in/profile.html|title=Official website of District Administration Narsinghpur|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> \n\nAs of 2001, Narsinghpur is the most literate district of the state.\n\n==History==\nIn 18 century the ruler of Narsinghpur Thakur ji was killed by British rulers and the fort of narsinghpur was totally destroyed. There are a number of sites of interest to archaeologists in the area, as the area has been inhabited since the second century AD, according to historical documents from that time. Narsinghpur has a number of sacred sites, including a nearby cave associated with Adi Guru Shankracharya's place of meditations and studies.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://narsinghpur.nic.in/history.html|title=Narsinghpur|website=narsinghpur.nic.in|access-date=2016-10-04}}</ref>\n\n===Satvahan period===\nThis area was under the rule of Satvahans from the second to fourth centuries AD, after which time it was under the Gupts when Samudra Gupt extended the borders of his kingdom. There is some historical evidence for Padi rule. There is no record of this area until the 9th century, when the Kalchuri kingdom was established. The Kalchuri capital was near the Narmada river, later established at Tripuri.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Raj Gond Vansh===\nAfter the establishment of Raj Gond Vansh, an era of peace and prosperity began in the area. This Vansh came to existence by Yadav Rao, who laid the foundation of a strong kingdom at a place called Garha\u2013Katanga and started a process of strong mighty rule. One of the rulers, [[Sangram Shah]] (1500\u20131541) had established 52 Garh, of the [[Gond Dynasty]]. The fort of [[Chauragarh]] (Chougan) at Narsinghpur was constructed by Sangram Shah, which is still an evidence of bravery of Veerarayan. He was son of Queen Rani Durgawati.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAmong the followers of Sangram Shah,  Dalpati Shah ruled for a period of 7 years peacefully. After, this Queen Durgawati took the reign and gave a proof of courage or bravery, and ruled for a period of 16 years (1540\u20141564). In 1564, the Queen died, while fighting bravely, giving a tough fight to Asaf Khan, the Sepoy Salar of King Akbar. In Narsinghpur district, at the castle fort of [[Chauragarh]], Asaf Khan trapped prince Veer Narayan and killed him with his cunning tactics. Thus Garha Katanga came under control of Mugals in 1564, Gonds Mugals. After then the area was under control of various officers and administrative or hereditary chiefs during the Maratha's rule. The boundaries of the area continued to change according to the powers and influence of their people. Chawarpatha, Barha, Saikheda, [[Gadarwara]], Shahpur, Singhpur, Shrinagar, and Tendukheda were headquarters of various [[pargana]]s\n\n===Bhonsle Rulers===\nIn 1785, Madhavji Bhonsle purchased the area of Mandla and Narmada Ghati in 27 [[lakh]]s. The area was under pressure of army rule during the reign of [[Raghuji Bhonsle]], Nawab of Bhopal and Pindari's. Due to unsuitability and other problems, the common people were extremely exploited. This period was also known as a period of problems and unsuitability. However, after the defeat of [[Bhosle]]s in [[Battle of Sitabuldi]] in 1817, British rule came into existence in the area.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===British period===\nAfter the Battle of Sitabuldi, this area came under the control of British rule in 1817, which was confirmed by an alliance in 1826. In this period the area was known as Gadarwara pargana, with Chichli and Gangai. The Gond Jagirs were under Marathas, where as Sindhiya had given Barha and Paloha Jagirs to Pindari Sardars, Chitu and Karim Khan. In 1818, the British army captured the fort of Chauragarh, and in 1830 the control of this area was given to a committee. During British rule, the Administration of this district was further improved, and in 1836 the area was partitioned and was merged in Hoshangabad district. But after Bundela revolt in 1843, this part was once again reinstated in this district.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Struggle for independence===\nDespite strong British rule, the desire for independence was prevalent among the common people. In 1825, Chawarpatha and Tendukheda were given to the British Government. In 1857 the police station of Chawarpatha and Tendukheda were captured by revolutionaries under the leadership of Gond Chief Delan Shah of Madanpur. With this, the struggle for independence was started. But in 1858, Delan Shah was caught and hanged to death. Thus in the year British curbed the struggle for independence, and they succeeded in establishing their rule.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Congress movement===\nAfter the establishment of Indian National Congress in 1885, even in this district, the feeling for Independence was prevalent. Strong efforts were made by the people here, being motivated by the efforts and leadership of [[Lokmanya Tilak]], [[Subhas Chandra Bose]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]], and [[Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru]]. Among the leaders of his district were Gayadutt, [[Manik Chand Lunawat]], Choudhary Shankar Lal, Raghunath Singh Kiledar, Mahendra singh Kiledar, Gopal Das Kathal, Thakur Niranjan Singh & Sri Shyam Sunder Narayan Musharan, who led the people of this district towards the Independence movements. In order to break the unity and enthusiasm of the people, the British had once again partitioned the district and merged it with [[Hoshangabad district]]. However, even then, enthusiasm as well as the fight for independence continued in the people's minds. During the mass demonstration of [[satyagrah]] at Chichli in 1932, Mansharam and Gauradevi lost their lives during police firing.\n\nThousands of revolutionaries faced the atrocities of British rule and gave an example of strong devotion for the country, and snipe against the British rule. When the country gained Independence in 1947, on 15 August, a new era started in this district. After 9 years of independence, when states were reorganized on the basis of languages, Narsinghpur, once again, became a district.

The water has its velocity changed by a stator which causes the water to be returned to the inner diameter of the rotor.\nFor a given mass of water, this velocity change yields a corresponding momentum change \u2013 and the rate of change of momentum is proportional to a force.

This is accomplished though manual or electronically controlled water valves. The higher the water levels within the brake the greater the loading. Water brakes are commonly used on some forms of [[dynamometer]] but have also been used on railways vehicles such as the British [[Advanced Passenger Train]].\n\n== Hydrokinetic construction (torque absorption) ==\nThe [[William Froude|Froude]] waterbrake is based on hydrokinetic construction or (torque absorption).\n\nThe machine consists of an impeller (rotor) which accelerates water outwards by its rotation. The water has its velocity changed by a stator which causes the water to be returned to the inner diameter of the rotor.\nFor a given mass of water, this velocity change yields a corresponding momentum change \u2013 and the rate of change of momentum is proportional to a force. This force acting at some point within the rotor and stator is a distance from the shaft centerline, and a force multiplied by a distance produces torque.\n\n==See also==\n{{commons category|Dynamometers}}\n* [[Torque converter]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Water Brake}}\n[[Category:Dynamometers]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_brake"}

Therefore, some penicillins are modified or given with other drugs for use against antibiotic-resistant bacteria or in immunocompromised patients. Use of clavulanic acid or tazobactam, beta-lactamase inhibitors, alongside penicillin gives penicillin activity against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. Beta-lactamase inhibitors irreversibly bind to beta-lactamase preventing it from breaking down the beta-lactam rings on the antibiotic molecule.  Alternatively, flucloxacillin is a modified penicillin that has activity against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria due to an acyl side chain that protects the beta-lactam ring from beta-lactamase.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite book |last1=Hitchings |first1=Andrew |last2=Lonsdale |first2=Dagan |last3=Burrage |first3=Daniel |last4=Baker |first4=Emma | name-list-format = vanc |title=Top 100 drugs : clinical pharmacology and practical prescribing |date=2015 |isbn=978-0-7020-5516-4 |pages=174\u2013181}}</ref>\n\n=== Mechanism of action ===\n{{Main|Beta-lactam antibiotic}}\n[[File:Penicillin spheroplast generation horizontal.svg|upright|Bacteria that attempt to grow and divide in the presence of penicillin fail to do so, and instead end up shedding their cell walls.<ref name=\":4\" />|thumb|right|600px]]\n[[File:Penicillin inhibition.svg|thumb|upright|right|Penicillin and other \u03b2-lactam antibiotics act by inhibiting [[penicillin-binding proteins]], which normally catalyze cross-linking of bacterial cell walls.]]\n\nBacteria constantly remodel their [[peptidoglycan]] cell walls, simultaneously building and breaking down portions of the cell wall as they grow and divide.

This results in cell lysis and death.\n\nSome bacteria produce enzymes that break down the beta-lactam ring, called beta-lactamases, which make the bacteria resistant to penicillin. Therefore, some penicillins are modified or given with other drugs for use against antibiotic-resistant bacteria or in immunocompromised patients. Use of clavulanic acid or tazobactam, beta-lactamase inhibitors, alongside penicillin gives penicillin activity against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. Beta-lactamase inhibitors irreversibly bind to beta-lactamase preventing it from breaking down the beta-lactam rings on the antibiotic molecule.  Alternatively, flucloxacillin is a modified penicillin that has activity against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria due to an acyl side chain that protects the beta-lactam ring from beta-lactamase.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite book |last1=Hitchings |first1=Andrew |last2=Lonsdale |first2=Dagan |last3=Burrage |first3=Daniel |last4=Baker |first4=Emma | name-list-format = vanc |title=Top 100 drugs : clinical pharmacology and practical prescribing |date=2015 |isbn=978-0-7020-5516-4 |pages=174\u2013181}}</ref>\n\n=== Mechanism of action ===\n{{Main|Beta-lactam antibiotic}}\n[[File:Penicillin spheroplast generation horizontal.svg|upright|Bacteria that attempt to grow and divide in the presence of penicillin fail to do so, and instead end up shedding their cell walls.<ref name=\":4\" />|thumb|right|600px]]\n[[File:Penicillin inhibition.svg|thumb|upright|right|Penicillin and other \u03b2-lactam antibiotics act by inhibiting [[penicillin-binding proteins]], which normally catalyze cross-linking of bacterial cell walls.]]\n\nBacteria constantly remodel their [[peptidoglycan]] cell walls, simultaneously building and breaking down portions of the cell wall as they grow and divide.

In addition, the build-up of peptidoglycan precursors triggers the activation of bacterial cell wall hydrolases and autolysins, which further digest the cell wall's peptidoglycans.

He expressed initial optimism that penicillin would be a useful disinfectant, because of its high potency and minimal toxicity in comparison to antiseptics of the day, and noted its laboratory value in the isolation of ''Bacillus influenzae'' (now called ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'').<ref name=Lax2004 /><ref name=Fleming1929>{{cite journal | vauthors = Krylov AK | title = [Gastroenterologic aspects of the clinical picture of internal diseases] | journal = Terapevticheskii Arkhiv | volume = 63 | issue = 2 | pages = 139\u201341 | year = 1929 | pmid = 2048009 }} Reprinted in {{cite journal | vauthors = Fleming A | title = On the antibacterial action of cultures of a penicillium, with special reference to their use in the isolation of B. influenzae. 1929 | journal = Bulletin of the World Health Organization | volume = 79 | issue = 8 | pages = 780\u201390 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11545337 | pmc = 2566493 }}</ref>\n\nFleming was a famously poor communicator and orator, which meant his findings were not initially given much attention.<ref name=Lax2004 /> He was unable to convince a chemist to help him extract and stabilize the antibacterial compound found in the broth filtrate.

The divergence of the lineage leading to ''H. sapiens'' out of ancestral ''H. erectus'' (or an intermediate species such as ''[[Homo antecessor]]'') is estimated to have occurred in Africa roughly 500,000 years ago.

The conflict killed about 250,000 people<ref>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13729504</ref> and eventually led to the involvement of the [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS) and of the [[United Nations]]. The peace did not last long, and in 1999 the [[Second Liberian Civil War]] broke out.\n\n[[Samuel Doe]] had led a rebellion that overthrew the elected government in 1980, and in [[Liberian general election, 1985|1985 held elections]] that were widely considered fraudulent. There had been one unsuccessful coup by a former military leader. In December 1989, former government minister [[Charles Taylor (Liberia)|Charles Taylor]] moved into the country from neighboring [[Ivory Coast]] to start an uprising meant to topple the Doe government.\n\nTaylor's forces, the [[National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (NPFL) battled with [[Prince Johnson]]'s rebel group, the [[Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (INPFL) \u2013 a faction of NPFL \u2013 for control in Monrovia. In 1990, Johnson seized the capital of [[Monrovia]] and executed Doe brutally.\n\nPeace negotiations and foreign involvement led to a ceasefire in 1995 that was broken the next year before a final peace agreement and new national elections were held in 1997. Taylor was elected [[President of Liberia]] in July 1997.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger - Samuel K. Doe.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Samuel Doe]] with then-Secretary of Defense of the United States [[Caspar W. Weinberger]] outside of the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] in 1982.]]\n\n=== Samuel Doe takes power in coup (1980) ===\n[[Samuel Doe]] had taken power in a popular rebellion in 1980 against the Liberian Government, becoming the first Liberian President of non [[American-Liberian]] descent. Doe established a military regime called the [[People's Representative]] and enjoyed Liberian ethnic groups who were denied power since the founding of the country in 1847\n\nAny hope that Doe would improve the way Liberia was run was put aside as he quickly clamped down on opposition, fueled by his paranoia of a counter-coup attempt against him. As promised, Doe held [[Liberian general election, 1985|elections in 1985]] and won the presidency by just enough of a margin to avoid a runoff. However, international monitors condemned this election as fraudulent.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/1985/1025/olib.html|title=Fraud charged in Liberia's first one-man, one-vote election|date=1985-10-25|work=Christian Science Monitor|access-date=2017-10-17|issn=0882-7729}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n=== Coup attempt by Thomas Johnson (November 1985) ===\n[[Thomas Johnson]], the former Commanding General of the Armed Forces of Liberia whom Doe had demoted and forced to flee the country, attempted to overthrow Doe's regime from neighbouring [[Sierra Leone]]. The coup attempt failed and Johnson was killed and allegedly eaten.<ref name=Dickovick>{{cite book |title=The World Today Series: Africa 2012 |last=Dickovick |first=J.

''Daily Star'' 1985-11-18: 5.</ref>\n\n=== Mistreatment of the Gio and Mano ethnic groups (1985) ===\nThe Gio and Mano ethnic groups were persecuted against because they were charged with treason against the state. Thus, they were seen as inferiors to the President's own tribe, the Krahn. The mistreatment of the Gio and Mano increased the tensions in Liberia, which had already been rising due to Doe's preferential treatment of his own group.\n\n=== Charles Taylor builds insurgent forces (1985-1989) ===\n[[Charles Taylor (Liberia)|Charles Taylor]], who had left Doe's government after being accused of embezzlement, assembled a group of rebels in [[C\u00f4te d'Ivoire]] (mostly ethnic Gios and Manos who felt persecuted by Doe) who later became known as the [[National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (NPFL). They invaded Nimba County on 24 December 1989. The Liberian Army retaliated against the whole population of the region, attacking unarmed civilians and burning villages. Many left as refugees for [[Guinea]] and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, but opposition to Doe was inflamed. [[Prince Johnson]], an NPFL fighter, split to form his own [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] force soon after crossing the border, based on the [[Gio Tribe|Gio tribe]] and named [[Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (INPFL).\n\n==First Liberian Civil War (1989-1997)==\n\n=== Charles Taylor's force attacks (1989) ===\n[[Charles Taylor (Liberia)|Charles Taylor]] organized and trained indigenous northerners in [[Ivory Coast]]. During Doe's regime Taylor had served in the Liberian Government's General Services Agency, acting  'as its ''de facto'' director'.<ref>Stephen Ellis, ''The Mask of Anarchy'', Hurst & Company, London, 2001, p.57, 67-68</ref> He fled to the United States in 1983 amid what Stephan Ellis describes as the 'increasingly menacing atmosphere in Monrovia' shortly before [[Thomas Quiwonkpa]], Doe's chief lieutenant, fled into exile himself. Doe requested Taylor's extradition for embezzling $900,000 of Liberian government funds. Taylor was thus arrested in the United States and after sixteen months broke out of a Massachusetts jail in circumstances that are still unclear.\n\n=== Krahn vs Gio and Mano ethnic groups ===\nThe NPFL initially encountered plenty of support within Nimba County, which had endured the majority of Samuel Doe's wrath after the 1985 attempted coup. Taylor and his force of 100 rebels reentered Liberia in 1989, on Christmas Eve, thousands of Gio and Mano joined them. Doe responded by sending two AFL battalions, including the 1st Infantry Battalion,<ref>HRW, Flight from Terror, May 1990</ref> to Nimba in December 1989-January 1990,<ref>Charles Hartung, 'Peacekeeping in Liberia: ECOMOG and the Struggle for Order,' Liberian Studies Journal, Volume XXX, No.2, 2005</ref> apparently under then-Colonel Hezekiah Bowen.<ref>Mark Huband, The Liberian Civil War, p.115, 118-119</ref>\n\nThe AFL acted in a very brutal and scorched-earth fashion, which quickly alienated the local people. The rebel invasion soon pitted [[Krahn people|ethnic Krahn]] sympathetic to the Doe regime against those victimized by it, the [[Gio Tribe|Gio]] and the Mano. Thousands of civilians were massacred on both sides. Hundreds of thousands fled their homes. The [[Monrovia Church massacre]] was carried out by approximately 30 ethnic Krahn government soldiers, killing 600 civilians in St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Monrovia, on 29 July 1990, the worst single atrocity of the First Liberian Civil War.<ref name=\"Bbcnews\" >{{cite news |date=12 February 2018|title=Liberian church massacre survivors seek US justice|trans-title=|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-42996851|language= |work=[[BBC News]]|location= |access-date=14 December 2018 }}</ref><ref name=\"Nytimes\" >{{cite news |date=31 July 1990|title=Liberia Troops Accused Of Massacre in Church|trans-title=|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/31/world/liberia-troops-accused-of-massacre-in-church.html|language= |work=[[The New York Times]]|location= |access-date=14 December 2018 }}</ref>\n\nBy May 1990 the AFL had been forced back to [[Gbarnga]], still under the control of Bowen's troops, but they lost the town to a NPFL assault on 28 May.<ref>Hubard, p.115</ref> By June 1990, Taylor's forces were laying siege to Monrovia.  In July 1990, [[Prince Yormie Johnson]] split from Taylor and formed the Independent National Patriotic Front (INPFL). The INPFL and NPFL continued their siege on Monrovia, which the AFL defended. Johnson quickly took control of parts of Monrovia prompting evacuation of foreign nationals and diplomats by the US Navy in August.\n\n=== ECOWAS intervention force (August 1990) ===\nIn August 1990, the 16-member [[ECOWAS|Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)]] agreed to deploy a joint military intervention force, the Economic Community Monitoring Group ([[ECOMOG]]), and place it under Nigerian leadership. The mission later included troops from non-ECOWAS countries, including Uganda and Tanzania. ECOMOG's objectives were to impose a cease-fire; help Liberians establish an interim government until elections could be held; stop the killing of innocent civilians; and ensure the safe evacuation of foreign nationals.\n\nECOMOG also sought to prevent the conflict from spreading into neighboring states, which share a complex history of state, economic, and ethno-linguistic social relations with Liberia. The [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS) attempted to persuade Doe to resign and go into exile, but despite his weak position&nbsp;\u2013 besieged in his mansion&nbsp;\u2013 he refused. [[ECOMOG]], an ECOWAS intervention force, arrived at the Freeport of Monrovia on August 24, 1990, landing from Nigerian and Ghanaian vessels.<ref>Adebajo, 2002, p.75</ref>\n\n=== Capture and killing of Samuel Doe (September 1990) ===\n[[File:Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia in Monrovia 1990.png|thumb|300px|[[Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia|INPFL]] militiamen in 1990 after taking control of much of [[Monrovia]].]]\n\nOn 9 September 1990, Doe visited the barely established, newly arrived ECOMOG headquarters in the Free Port of Maher. Stephen Ellis says,<ref>''The Mask of Anarchy'', by Stephen Ellis, 2001, p.1-9</ref> his motive was to lay a complaint that the ECOMOG commander had not paid a courtesy call to Doe, the Head of State, however, the exact circumstances that led to Doe's visit to the Free Port are still unclear. Doe had been under pressure to accept exile outside of Liberia. However, after Doe arrived, a large rebel force led by Prince Johnson's INPFL arrived at the headquarters and then attacked Doe's party. Doe was captured and taken to the INPFL's Caldwell base. He was brutally tortured before being killed and dismembered. His torture and execution was videotaped by his captors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.c-r.org/our-work/accord/liberia/chronology.php#1990 |title=Liberia: Chronology |accessdate=2007-02-26 |last=Armon |first=Jeremy |author2=Andy Carl |year=1996 |work=Conciliation Resources |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308142809/http://www.c-r.org/our-work/accord/liberia/chronology.php#1990 |archive-date=8 March 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=MASK>{{cite book|last=Ellis|first=Stephen|title=The Mask of Anarchy: The Destruction of Liberia and the Religious Dimension of African Civil War|origyear=1999|year=2007|publisher=Hurst & Company|location=London, UK|isbn=1850654174|pages=1\u201316}}</ref>\n\nJohnson's INPFL and Taylor's NPFL continued to struggle for control of Monrovia in the months that followed.  With military discipline absent and bloodshed throughout the capital region, members of ECOWAS created the Economic Community Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) to restore order. The force comprised some 4,000 troops from [[Nigeria]], [[Ghana]], [[Sierra Leone]], the [[Gambia]] and [[Guinea]]. ECOMOG succeeded in bringing Taylor and Johnson to agree to its intervention, but Taylor's forces engaged it in the port area of Monrovia.\n\n=== Peace making attempts (1990) ===\nA series of peacemaking conferences in regional capitals followed. There were meetings in Bamako in November 1990, Lome in January 1991, and Yamoussoukro in June\u2013October 1991. But the first seven peace conferences, including the Yamoussoukro I-IV processes failed. In November 1990, ECOWAS invited the principal Liberian players to meet in [[Banjul]], Gambia to form a government of national unity. The negotiated settlement established the Interim Government of National Unity (IGNU), led by [[Amos Sawyer|Dr. Amos Sawyer]], leader of the LPP. Bishop Ronald Diggs of the Liberian Council of Churches became vice president. However, Taylor's NPFL refused to attend the conference. Within days, hostilities resumed.  ECOMOG was reinforced in order to protect the interim government. Sawyer was able to establish his authority over most of Monrovia, but the rest of Liberia was in the hands of various factions of the NPFL or of local gangs.\n\n===ULIMO===\nThe [[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy]] (ULIMO) was formed in June 1991 by supporters of the late [[President of Liberia|President]] [[Samuel K. Doe]] and former [[Armed Forces of Liberia]] (AFL) fighters who had taken refuge in [[Guinea]] and [[Sierra Leone]]. It was led by Raleigh Seekie, a deputy [[Minister of Finance]] in the Doe government.\n\nAfter fighting alongside the Sierra Leonean army against the [[Revolutionary United Front]] (RUF), ULIMO forces entered western Liberia in September 1991. The group scored significant gains in areas held by another rebel group&nbsp;\u2013 the [[National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (NPFL), notably around the diamond mining areas of [[Lofa County|Lofa]] and [[Bomi County|Bomi]] [[Counties of Liberia|counties]].\n\nFrom its outset, ULIMO was beset with internal divisions and the group effectively broke into two separate militias in 1994: [[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy-Johnson faction|ULIMO-J]], an ethnic [[Krahn]] faction led by General [[Roosevelt Johnson]] and [[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy-Kromah faction|ULIMO-K]], a [[Mandinka people|Mandingo]]-based faction led by [[Alhaji G.V. Kromah]].\n\nThe group was alleged to have committed serious violations of [[human rights]], both before and after its breakup.\n\n=== Attack on Monrovia (1992) ===\nPeace was still far off as both Taylor and Johnson claimed power.  ECOMOG declared an Interim Government of National Unity (IGNU) with [[Amos Sawyer]] as their president, with the broad support of Johnson.  Taylor launched an assault on Monrovia on October 15, 1992, named 'Operation Octopus.'<ref>See Ellis, Mask of Anarchy, 98-99.</ref> which  may have been led by Burkina Faso soldiers.<ref>Herbert Howe, Ambiguous Order, 2005, 143.</ref> The resulting siege lasted two months.\n\nBy late December, ECOMOG had pushed the NPFL back beyond Monrovia's suburbs.\n\n===UNOMIL===\n{{main article|UNOMIL}}\nIn 1993, ECOWAS brokered a peace agreement in [[Cotonou]], Benin. Following this, on September 22, 1993, the United Nations (U.N.) Security Council established the UN Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL), to support ECOMOG in implementing this peace agreement. UNOMIL was deployed in early 1994 with 368 military observers and associated civilian personnel to monitor implementation of the Cotonou Peace Agreement, prior to elections originally planned for February/March 1994.\n\nRenewed armed hostilities broke out in May 1994 and continued, becoming especially intense in July and August. ECOMOG, and later UNOMIL, members were captured and held hostage by some factions. By mid-1994, the humanitarian situation had become disastrous, with 1.8 million Liberians in need of humanitarian assistance. Conditions continued to deteriorate, but humanitarian agencies were unable to reach many in need due to hostilities and general insecurity.\n\nFactional leaders agreed in September 1994 to the Akosombo Agreement, a supplement to the Cotonou agreement, named after the Ghanaian town where it was signed. The security situation in Liberia remained poor. In October 1994, in the face of ECOMOG funding shortfalls and a lack of will by the Liberian combatants to honor agreements to end the war, the UN Security Council reduced to about 90 the number of UNOMIL observers. It extended UNOMIL's mandate and subsequently extended it several times until September 1997.\n\nIn December 1994, the factions and other parties signed the Accra Agreement, a supplement to the Akosombo Agreement. Disagreements ensued and fighting continued.\n\n===Ceasefire (1995)===\nIn August 1995, the main factions signed an agreement largely brokered by Ghanaian President [[Jerry Rawlings]]. At a conference sponsored by ECOWAS, the United Nations and the United States, the European Union, and the [[Organization of African Unity]], Charles Taylor agreed to a cease-fire.\n\nAt the beginning of September 1995, Liberia's three principal warlords&nbsp;\u2013 Taylor, [[George Boley]] and [[Alhaji Kromah]]&nbsp;\u2013 made theatrical entrances into Monrovia. A ruling council of six members under civilian [[Wilton G. S. Sankawulo]] and with the three factional heads Taylor, Kromah and Boley, took control of the country preparatory to elections that were originally scheduled for 1996.\n\n=== Fighting in Monrovia (1996) ===\n[[File:National Patriotic Liberation Front fighters in Monrovia 1996.png|thumb|300px|[[National Patriotic Front of Liberia|NPFL]] fighters search for [[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy|ULIMO]] militants in [[Monrovia]].]]\n\nHeavy fighting broke out again in April 1996. This led to the evacuation of most international [[non-governmental organization]]s and the destruction of much of Monrovia.\n\nIn August 1996, these battles were ended by the [[Abuja]] Accord in Nigeria, agreeing to [[disarmament]] and [[demobilization]] by 1997 and [[Liberia elections, 1997|elections]] in July of that year. 3 September 1996, Sankawulo is followed by [[Ruth Perry]] as chairwoman of the ruling council, who served until 2 August 1997.\n\n=== 1997 Elections ===\n{{Main|1997 Liberian general election}}\nSimultaneous elections for the [[Liberia elections, 1997#Presidential election results|presidency]] and [[Liberia elections, 1997#Legislative election results|national assembly]] were finally held in July 1997.\nIn a climate hardly conducive to free movement and security of persons, Taylor and his [[National Patriotic Party]] won an overwhelming victory against 12 other candidates.  Assisted by widespread intimidation, Taylor took 75 per cent of the presidential poll (no other candidate won more than 10 per cent) while the NPP won a similar proportion of seats in both parliamentary chambers. 2 August 1997, Ruth Perry handed power to elected president Charles Taylor.\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{See also|1998 Monrovia clashes}}\n\nIn 1997, the Liberian people elected Charles Taylor as the President after he entered the capital city, [[Monrovia]], by force. Liberians had voted for Taylor in the hope that he would end the bloodshed.  The bloodshed did slow considerably, but it did not end. Violent events flared up regularly after the putative end of the war. Taylor, furthermore, was accused of backing guerrillas in neighboring countries and funneling diamond money into arms purchases for the rebel armies he supported, and into luxuries for himself. The implicit unrest manifested during the late 1990s is emblematic in the sharp national economic decline and the prevalent sale of diamonds and timber in exchange for small arms.\n\nAfter Taylor's victory, Liberia was peaceful enough so that refugees began to return. But other leaders were forced to leave the country, and some ULIMO forces reformed as the [[Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy]] (LURD). LURD began fighting in [[Lofa County]] with the aim of destabilizing the government and gaining control of the local [[diamond]] fields, leading to the [[Second Liberian Civil War]].\n\n===Impact===\nThe Liberian civil war was one of Africa's bloodiest. From 1989-1996, it claimed the lives of more than 200,000 Liberians and further displaced a million others into refugee camps in neighboring countries. [[Child soldier]]s were used throughout the war.\n\nThe civil war claimed the lives of one out of every 17 people in the country, uprooted most of the rest, and destroyed a once-viable economic infrastructure.  The strife also spread to Liberia's neighbors. It helped slow democratization in West Africa at the beginning of the 1990s and destabilized a region that already was one of the world's most unsteady.\n\n==Second Liberian Civil War==\nThe [[Second Liberian Civil War]] began in 1999 and ended in October 2003, when [[ECOWAS]] intervened to stop the [[Siege of Monrovia|rebel siege]] on Monrovia and exiled Charles Taylor to Nigeria until he was arrested in 2006 and taken to [[The Hague]] for his trial. By the conclusion of the final war, more than 250,000 people had been killed and nearly 1 million displaced.

He denied these accusations but was eventually testified against by his victims.

The conflict killed about 250,000 people<ref>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13729504</ref> and eventually led to the involvement of the [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS) and of the [[United Nations]]. The peace did not last long, and in 1999 the [[Second Liberian Civil War]] broke out.\n\n[[Samuel Doe]] had led a rebellion that overthrew the elected government in 1980, and in [[Liberian general election, 1985|1985 held elections]] that were widely considered fraudulent. There had been one unsuccessful coup by a former military leader. In December 1989, former government minister [[Charles Taylor (Liberia)|Charles Taylor]] moved into the country from neighboring [[Ivory Coast]] to start an uprising meant to topple the Doe government.\n\nTaylor's forces, the [[National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (NPFL) battled with [[Prince Johnson]]'s rebel group, the [[Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (INPFL) \u2013 a faction of NPFL \u2013 for control in Monrovia. In 1990, Johnson seized the capital of [[Monrovia]] and executed Doe brutally.\n\nPeace negotiations and foreign involvement led to a ceasefire in 1995 that was broken the next year before a final peace agreement and new national elections were held in 1997. Taylor was elected [[President of Liberia]] in July 1997.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger - Samuel K. Doe.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Samuel Doe]] with then Secretary of Defense of the United States [[Caspar W. Weinberger]] outside of the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] in 1982.]]\n\n=== Samuel Doe takes power in coup (1980) ===\n[[Samuel Doe]] had taken power in a popular rebellion in 1980 against the Liberian Government, becoming the first Liberian President of non [[Americo-Liberian]] descent. Doe established a military regime called the [[People's Representative]] and enjoyed Liberian ethnic groups who were denied power since the founding of the country in 1847\n\nAny hope that Doe would improve the way Liberia was run was put aside as he quickly clamped down on opposition, fueled by his paranoia of a counter-coup attempt against him. As promised, Doe held [[Liberian general election, 1985|elections in 1985]] and won the presidency by just enough of a margin to avoid a runoff. However, international monitors condemned this election as fraudulent.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/1985/1025/olib.html|title=Fraud charged in Liberia's first one-man, one-vote election|date=1985-10-25|work=Christian Science Monitor|access-date=2017-10-17|issn=0882-7729}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n=== Coup attempt by Thomas Johnson (November 1985) ===\n[[Thomas Johnson]], the former Commanding General of the Armed Forces of Liberia whom Doe had demoted and forced to flee the country, attempted to overthrow Doe's regime from neighboring [[Sierra Leone]]. The coup attempt failed and Johnson was killed and allegedly eaten.<ref name=Dickovick>{{cite book |title=The World Today Series: Africa 2012 |last=Dickovick |first=J.

''Daily Star'' 1985-11-18: 5.</ref>\n\n=== Mistreatment of the Gio and Mano ethnic groups (1985) ===\nThe Gio and Mano ethnic groups were persecuted against because they were charged with treason against the state. Thus, they were seen as inferiors to the President's own tribe, the Krahn. The mistreatment of the Gio and Mano increased the tensions in Liberia, which had already been rising due to Doe's preferential treatment of his own group.\n\n=== Charles Taylor builds insurgent forces (1985-1989) ===\n[[Charles Taylor (Liberia)|Charles Taylor]], who had left Doe's government after being accused of embezzlement, assembled a group of rebels in [[C\u00f4te d'Ivoire]] (mostly ethnic Gios and Manos who felt persecuted by Doe) who later became known as the [[National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (NPFL). They invaded Nimba County on 24 December 1989. The Liberian Army retaliated against the whole population of the region, attacking unarmed civilians and burning villages. Many left as refugees for [[Guinea]] and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, but opposition to Doe was inflamed. [[Prince Johnson]], an NPFL fighter, split to form his own [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] force soon after crossing the border, based on the [[Gio Tribe|Gio tribe]] and named [[Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (INPFL).\n\n==First Liberian Civil War (1989-1997)==\n\n=== Charles Taylor's force attacks (1989) ===\n[[Charles Taylor (Liberia)|Charles Taylor]] organized and trained indigenous northerners in [[Ivory Coast]]. During Doe's regime Taylor had served in the Liberian Government's General Services Agency, acting  'as its ''de facto'' director'.<ref>Stephen Ellis, ''The Mask of Anarchy'', Hurst & Company, London, 2001, p.57, 67-68</ref> He fled to the United States in 1983 amid what Stephan Ellis describes as the 'increasingly menacing atmosphere in Monrovia' shortly before [[Thomas Quiwonkpa]], Doe's chief lieutenant, fled into exile himself. Doe requested Taylor's extradition for embezzling $900,000 of Liberian government funds. Taylor was thus arrested in the United States and after sixteen months broke out of a Massachusetts jail in circumstances that are still unclear.\n\n=== Krahn vs Gio and Mano ethnic groups ===\nThe NPFL initially encountered plenty of support within Nimba County, which had endured the majority of Samuel Doe's wrath after the 1985 attempted coup. Taylor and his force of 100 rebels reentered Liberia in 1989, on Christmas Eve, thousands of Gio and Mano joined them. Doe responded by sending two AFL battalions, including the 1st Infantry Battalion,<ref>HRW, Flight from Terror, May 1990</ref> to Nimba in December 1989-January 1990,<ref>Charles Hartung, 'Peacekeeping in Liberia: ECOMOG and the Struggle for Order,' Liberian Studies Journal, Volume XXX, No.2, 2005</ref> apparently under then-Colonel Hezekiah Bowen.<ref>Mark Huband, The Liberian Civil War, p.115, 118-119</ref>\n\nThe AFL acted in a very brutal and scorched-earth fashion, which quickly alienated the local people. The rebel invasion soon pitted [[Krahn people|ethnic Krahn]] sympathetic to the Doe regime against those victimized by it, the [[Gio Tribe|Gio]] and the Mano. Thousands of civilians were massacred on both sides. Hundreds of thousands fled their homes. The [[Monrovia Church massacre]] was carried out by approximately 30 ethnic Krahn government soldiers, killing 600 civilians in St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Monrovia, on 29 July 1990, the worst single atrocity of the First Liberian Civil War.<ref name=\"Bbcnews\" >{{cite news |date=12 February 2018|title=Liberian church massacre survivors seek US justice|trans-title=|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-42996851|language= |work=[[BBC News]]|location= |access-date=14 December 2018 }}</ref><ref name=\"Nytimes\" >{{cite news |date=31 July 1990|title=Liberia Troops Accused Of Massacre in Church|trans-title=|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/31/world/liberia-troops-accused-of-massacre-in-church.html|language= |work=[[The New York Times]]|location= |access-date=14 December 2018 }}</ref>\n\nBy May 1990 the AFL had been forced back to [[Gbarnga]], still under the control of Bowen's troops, but they lost the town to a NPFL assault on 28 May.<ref>Hubard, p.115</ref> By June 1990, Taylor's forces were laying siege to Monrovia.  In July 1990, [[Prince Yormie Johnson]] split from Taylor and formed the Independent National Patriotic Front (INPFL). The INPFL and NPFL continued their siege on Monrovia, which the AFL defended. Johnson quickly took control of parts of Monrovia prompting evacuation of foreign nationals and diplomats by the US Navy in August.\n\n=== ECOWAS intervention force (August 1990) ===\nIn August 1990, the 16-member [[ECOWAS|Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)]] agreed to deploy a joint military intervention force, the Economic Community Monitoring Group ([[ECOMOG]]), and place it under Nigerian leadership. The mission later included troops from non-ECOWAS countries, including Uganda and Tanzania. ECOMOG's objectives were to impose a cease-fire; help Liberians establish an interim government until elections could be held; stop the killing of innocent civilians; and ensure the safe evacuation of foreign nationals.\n\nECOMOG also sought to prevent the conflict from spreading into neighboring states, which share a complex history of state, economic, and ethno-linguistic social relations with Liberia. The [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS) attempted to persuade Doe to resign and go into exile, but despite his weak position&nbsp;\u2013 besieged in his mansion&nbsp;\u2013 he refused. [[ECOMOG]], an ECOWAS intervention force, arrived at the Freeport of Monrovia on August 24, 1990, landing from Nigerian and Ghanaian vessels.<ref>Adebajo, 2002, p.75</ref>\n\n=== Capture and killing of Samuel Doe (September 1990) ===\n[[File:Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia in Monrovia 1990.png|thumb|300px|[[Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia|INPFL]] militiamen in 1990 after taking control of much of [[Monrovia]].]]\n\nOn 9 September 1990, Doe visited the barely established, newly arrived ECOMOG headquarters in the Free Port of Maher. Stephen Ellis says,<ref>''The Mask of Anarchy'', by Stephen Ellis, 2001, p.1-9</ref> his motive was to lay a complaint that the ECOMOG commander had not paid a courtesy call to Doe, the Head of State, however, the exact circumstances that led to Doe's visit to the Free Port are still unclear. Doe had been under pressure to accept exile outside of Liberia. However, after Doe arrived, a large rebel force led by Prince Johnson's INPFL arrived at the headquarters and then attacked Doe's party. Doe was captured and taken to the INPFL's Caldwell base. He was brutally tortured before being killed and dismembered. His torture and execution was videotaped by his captors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.c-r.org/our-work/accord/liberia/chronology.php#1990 |title=Liberia: Chronology |accessdate=2007-02-26 |last=Armon |first=Jeremy |author2=Andy Carl |year=1996 |work=Conciliation Resources |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308142809/http://www.c-r.org/our-work/accord/liberia/chronology.php#1990 |archive-date=8 March 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=MASK>{{cite book|last=Ellis|first=Stephen|title=The Mask of Anarchy: The Destruction of Liberia and the Religious Dimension of African Civil War|origyear=1999|year=2007|publisher=Hurst & Company|location=London, UK|isbn=1850654174|pages=1\u201316}}</ref>\n\nJohnson's INPFL and Taylor's NPFL continued to struggle for control of Monrovia in the months that followed.  With military discipline absent and bloodshed throughout the capital region, members of ECOWAS created the Economic Community Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) to restore order. The force comprised some 4,000 troops from [[Nigeria]], [[Ghana]], [[Sierra Leone]], the [[Gambia]] and [[Guinea]]. ECOMOG succeeded in bringing Taylor and Johnson to agree to its intervention, but Taylor's forces engaged it in the port area of Monrovia.\n\n=== Peace making attempts (1990) ===\nA series of peacemaking conferences in regional capitals followed. There were meetings in Bamako in November 1990, Lome in January 1991, and Yamoussoukro in June\u2013October 1991. But the first seven peace conferences, including the Yamoussoukro I-IV processes failed. In November 1990, ECOWAS invited the principal Liberian players to meet in [[Banjul]], Gambia to form a government of national unity. The negotiated settlement established the Interim Government of National Unity (IGNU), led by [[Amos Sawyer|Dr. Amos Sawyer]], leader of the LPP. Bishop Ronald Diggs of the Liberian Council of Churches became vice president. However, Taylor's NPFL refused to attend the conference. Within days, hostilities resumed.  ECOMOG was reinforced in order to protect the interim government. Sawyer was able to establish his authority over most of Monrovia, but the rest of Liberia was in the hands of various factions of the NPFL or of local gangs.\n\n===ULIMO===\nThe [[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy]] (ULIMO) was formed in June 1991 by supporters of the late [[President of Liberia|President]] [[Samuel K. Doe]] and former [[Armed Forces of Liberia]] (AFL) fighters who had taken refuge in [[Guinea]] and [[Sierra Leone]]. It was led by Raleigh Seekie, a deputy [[Minister of Finance]] in the Doe government.\n\nAfter fighting alongside the Sierra Leonean army against the [[Revolutionary United Front]] (RUF), ULIMO forces entered western Liberia in September 1991. The group scored significant gains in areas held by another rebel group&nbsp;\u2013 the [[National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (NPFL), notably around the diamond mining areas of [[Lofa County|Lofa]] and [[Bomi County|Bomi]] [[Counties of Liberia|counties]].\n\nFrom its outset, ULIMO was beset with internal divisions and the group effectively broke into two separate militias in 1994: [[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy-Johnson faction|ULIMO-J]], an ethnic [[Krahn]] faction led by General [[Roosevelt Johnson]] and [[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy-Kromah faction|ULIMO-K]], a [[Mandinka people|Mandingo]]-based faction led by [[Alhaji G.V. Kromah]].\n\nThe group was alleged to have committed serious violations of [[human rights]], both before and after its breakup.\n\n=== Attack on Monrovia (1992) ===\nPeace was still far off as both Taylor and Johnson claimed power.  ECOMOG declared an Interim Government of National Unity (IGNU) with [[Amos Sawyer]] as their president, with the broad support of Johnson.  Taylor launched an assault on Monrovia on October 15, 1992, named 'Operation Octopus.'<ref>See Ellis, Mask of Anarchy, 98-99.</ref> which  may have been led by Burkina Faso soldiers.<ref>Herbert Howe, Ambiguous Order, 2005, 143.</ref> The resulting siege lasted two months.\n\nBy late December, ECOMOG had pushed the NPFL back beyond Monrovia's suburbs.\n\n===UNOMIL===\n{{main article|UNOMIL}}\nIn 1993, ECOWAS brokered a peace agreement in [[Cotonou]], Benin. Following this, on September 22, 1993, the United Nations (U.N.) Security Council established the UN Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL), to support ECOMOG in implementing this peace agreement. UNOMIL was deployed in early 1994 with 368 military observers and associated civilian personnel to monitor implementation of the Cotonou Peace Agreement, prior to elections originally planned for February/March 1994.\n\nRenewed armed hostilities broke out in May 1994 and continued, becoming especially intense in July and August. ECOMOG, and later UNOMIL, members were captured and held hostage by some factions. By mid-1994, the humanitarian situation had become disastrous, with 1.8 million Liberians in need of humanitarian assistance. Conditions continued to deteriorate, but humanitarian agencies were unable to reach many in need due to hostilities and general insecurity.\n\nFactional leaders agreed in September 1994 to the Akosombo Agreement, a supplement to the Cotonou agreement, named after the Ghanaian town where it was signed. The security situation in Liberia remained poor. In October 1994, in the face of ECOMOG funding shortfalls and a lack of will by the Liberian combatants to honor agreements to end the war, the UN Security Council reduced to about 90 the number of UNOMIL observers. It extended UNOMIL's mandate and subsequently extended it several times until September 1997.\n\nIn December 1994, the factions and other parties signed the Accra Agreement, a supplement to the Akosombo Agreement. Disagreements ensued and fighting continued.\n\n===Ceasefire (1995)===\nIn August 1995, the main factions signed an agreement largely brokered by Ghanaian President [[Jerry Rawlings]]. At a conference sponsored by ECOWAS, the United Nations and the United States, the European Union, and the [[Organization of African Unity]], Charles Taylor agreed to a cease-fire.\n\nAt the beginning of September 1995, Liberia's three principal warlords&nbsp;\u2013 Taylor, [[George Boley]] and [[Alhaji Kromah]]&nbsp;\u2013 made theatrical entrances into Monrovia. A ruling council of six members under civilian [[Wilton G. S. Sankawulo]] and with the three factional heads Taylor, Kromah and Boley, took control of the country preparatory to elections that were originally scheduled for 1996.\n\n=== Fighting in Monrovia (1996) ===\n[[File:National Patriotic Liberation Front fighters in Monrovia 1996.png|thumb|300px|[[National Patriotic Front of Liberia|NPFL]] fighters search for [[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy|ULIMO]] militants in [[Monrovia]].]]\n\nHeavy fighting broke out again in April 1996. This led to the evacuation of most international [[non-governmental organization]]s and the destruction of much of Monrovia.\n\nIn August 1996, these battles were ended by the [[Abuja]] Accord in Nigeria, agreeing to [[disarmament]] and [[demobilization]] by 1997 and [[Liberia elections, 1997|elections]] in July of that year. 3 September 1996, Sankawulo is followed by [[Ruth Perry]] as chairwoman of the ruling council, who served until 2 August 1997.\n\n=== 1997 Elections ===\n{{Main|1997 Liberian general election}}\nSimultaneous elections for the [[Liberia elections, 1997#Presidential election results|presidency]] and [[Liberia elections, 1997#Legislative election results|national assembly]] were finally held in July 1997.\nIn a climate hardly conducive to free movement and security of persons, Taylor and his [[National Patriotic Party]] won an overwhelming victory against 12 other candidates.  Assisted by widespread intimidation, Taylor took 75 per cent of the presidential poll (no other candidate won more than 10 per cent) while the NPP won a similar proportion of seats in both parliamentary chambers. 2 August 1997, Ruth Perry handed power to elected president Charles Taylor.\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{See also|1998 Monrovia clashes}}\n\nIn 1997, the Liberian people elected Charles Taylor as the President after he entered the capital city, [[Monrovia]], by force. Liberians had voted for Taylor in the hope that he would end the bloodshed.  The bloodshed did slow considerably, but it did not end. Violent events flared up regularly after the putative end of the war. Taylor, furthermore, was accused of backing guerrillas in neighboring countries and funneling diamond money into arms purchases for the rebel armies he supported, and into luxuries for himself. The implicit unrest manifested during the late 1990s is emblematic in the sharp national economic decline and the prevalent sale of diamonds and timber in exchange for small arms.\n\nAfter Taylor's victory, Liberia was peaceful enough so that refugees began to return. But other leaders were forced to leave the country, and some ULIMO forces reformed as the [[Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy]] (LURD). LURD began fighting in [[Lofa County]] with the aim of destabilizing the government and gaining control of the local [[diamond]] fields, leading to the [[Second Liberian Civil War]].\n\n===Impact===\nThe Liberian civil war was one of Africa's bloodiest. From 1989-1996, it claimed the lives of more than 200,000 Liberians and further displaced a million others into refugee camps in neighboring countries. [[Child soldier]]s were used throughout the war.\n\nThe civil war claimed the lives of one out of every 17 people in the country, uprooted most of the rest, and destroyed a once-viable economic infrastructure.  The strife also spread to Liberia's neighbors. It helped slow democratization in West Africa at the beginning of the 1990s and destabilized a region that already was one of the world's most unsteady.\n\n==Second Liberian Civil War==\nThe [[Second Liberian Civil War]] began in 1999 and ended in October 2003, when [[ECOWAS]] intervened to stop the [[Siege of Monrovia|rebel siege]] on Monrovia and exiled Charles Taylor to Nigeria until he was arrested in 2006 and taken to [[The Hague]] for his trial. By the conclusion of the final war, more than 250,000 people had been killed and nearly 1 million displaced. Half that number remain to be repatriated in 2005, at the election of Liberia's first democratic President since the initial 1980 ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' of Samuel Doe.\n\nFormer president [[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf]], who initially was a strong supporter of Charles Taylor, was inaugurated in January 2006 and the National Transitional Government of Liberia terminated its power.\n\nCharles Taylor's Trial\nCharles Taylor was sentenced to a trial in 2003, after being accused of rape and acts of sexual violence, pormoting child soldiers, and an illegal ownership of weapons. He denied these accusations but was eventually testified against by his victims. He was then senteced to 50 years in prison. \n== Lists ==\n\n===Armed groups that participated in the war===\n*[[Armed Forces of Liberia]] (AFL)\n*[[Liberia Peace Council]] (LPC)\n*[[Lofa Defense Force]] (LDF)\n*[[National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (NPFL)\n**[[Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (INPFL)\n**[[National Patriotic Front of Liberia-Central Revolutionary Council]] (NPFL-CRC)\n*[[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy]] (ULIMO)\n**[[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy-Johnson faction]] (ULIMO-J)\n**[[United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy-Kromah faction]] (ULIMO-K)\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2017}}\n=== Peace agreements ===\nPeace agreements signed included the:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=94&value=#|title=Uppsala Conflict Data Program}}</ref> \n*Banjul III Agreement (1990-10-24)\n*Bamako Ceasefire Agreement (1990-11-28)\n*Banjul IV Agreement (1990-12-21)\n*Lom\u00e9 Agreement (1991-02-13)\n*Yamoussoukro IV Peace Agreement (1991-10-30)\n*Geneva Agreement 1992 (1992-04-07)\n*Cotonou Peace Agreement (1993-07-25)\n*Akosombo Peace Agreement (1994-09-12)\n*Accra Agreements/Akosombo clarification agreement (1994-12-21)\n*Abuja Peace Agreement (1995-08-19)\n\n==See also==\n*[[Second Liberian Civil War]]\n\n'''General:'''\n*[[History of Liberia]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Gerdes, Felix: Civil War and State Formation: The Political Economy of War and Peace in Liberia, Frankfurt/New York: Campus Verlag & University of Chicago Press, 2013\n*Hoffman, Danny. \"The City as Barracks: Freetown, Monrovia, and the Organization of Violence in Postcolonial African Cities.\" Cultural Anthropology.
