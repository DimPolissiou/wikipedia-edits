On 15 September 2002 a [[Daily Star Sunday|sister Sunday edition]], was launched with a separate staff. On 31 October 2009, the ''Daily Star'' published its 10,000th issue.\n\nWhen the paper was launched from Manchester, it was circulated only in the North and Midlands. It was conceived by the then-owners of Express Newspapers, [[Trafalgar House (company)|Trafalgar House]], to take on the strength of the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' and ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' in the north. It was also intended to use the under-capacity of the [[Great Ancoats Street]] presses in Manchester as the ''[[Daily Express]]'' was losing circulation. The ''Daily Star'' sold out its first night print of 1,400,000. Its cover price has decreased over the years to compete with its rival ''The Sun''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/markets/article-23842174-red-top-papers-prepare-for-marketing-war.do |title=Red-top papers prepare for marketing war |website=London Evening Standard |accessdate=7 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609133251/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/markets/article-23842174-red-top-papers-prepare-for-marketing-war.do |archivedate=9 June 2010  }}</ref>\n\nThe ''Daily Star'' is published by [[Reach plc]].

Such models as [[Cherry Dee]] and [[Michelle Marsh]] have also appeared on their page 3. These women were known in the paper as \"Star Babes\". The paper's glamour photographer is [[Jeany Savage]].\n\nOther regular features in the ''Daily Star'' include Wired, a daily gossip column edited by James Cabooter, \"Hot TV\", a television news column edited by Ed Gleave and Peter Dyke, Mike Ward's weekly television review page and \"Forum\", a daily page devoted to readers' [[SMS language|text messages]], which are apparently printed verbatim. Opinion columns by [[Dominik Diamond]] and [[Vanessa Feltz]] were discontinued in 2008.

The editor of the ''Daily Star'', [[Lloyd Turner (journalist)|Lloyd Turner]], was sacked six weeks after the trial. However, the newspaper always stood by its story, and on 19 July 2001 Archer was found guilty of perjury and perverting the course of justice at the 1987 trial and was sentenced to a total of four years' imprisonment.

He was arrested the next day at a local railway station in possession of a forged pass and handed back to the British. Whilst in British custody he escaped, but again was caught after little more than 24 hours. Two weeks later, he escaped custody for a second time and again was arrested within a day. On 13 July he was charged with having deserted on three occasions and of conduct to the prejudice of good order (having a forged pass). He was undefended at his trial. He pleaded guilty to the forgery, but not guilty to the counts of desertion. His battalion adjutant gave evidence, saying that Fraser was \"a continual source of annoyance\", a shirker and a continual deserter.
