It was built for the [[Birmingham Barons]] in 1910 by industrialist and team-owner [[Rick Woodward]] and has served as the home park for the Birmingham Barons and the [[Birmingham Black Barons]] of the [[Negro League baseball|Negro Leagues]]. Though the Barons moved their home games to the Hoover Met in the suburbs, and most recently to [[Regions Field]] in Birmingham, Rickwood Field has been preserved and is undergoing gradual restoration as a \"working museum\" where baseball's history can be experienced. The Barons also play one regular season game a year at Rickwood Field.  Rickwood Field is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nris\"/>\n\n==History==\nThe Birmingham Coal Barons baseball team began playing professionally in 1887, with their home games at an informal park called \"Slag Pile Field\" in West End. In 1901 they joined the [[Southern Association]].\n\nAllen Harvey \"Rick\" Woodward, chairman of Woodward Iron Company and grandson of pioneer Birmingham industrialist Stimpson Harvey Woodward, purchased a majority share of the Birmingham Coal Barons baseball team from J. William McQueen in 1909 while he was still in his 20s. Immediately he began planning a grand showplace for his new team. He contacted [[Connie Mack]] for advice on the details, including the field dimensions. He settled on [[Shibe Park]] in [[Philadelphia]] (which was controlled by Mack's team and later renamed Connie Mack Stadium) and [[Forbes Field]] in [[Pittsburgh]] as the models for the new park. He purchased land in the West End neighborhood of Birmingham from the Alabama Central Railroad. The $75,000 structure was designed by Southeastern Engineering Company of Birmingham (a short-lived subsidiary of [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]]'s General Fireproofing Company) and completed during the summer of 1910. The 12.7 [[acre]] (51,000&nbsp;m\u00b2) park was flanked along the basepaths by concrete and steel stands. A tile-roofed cupola on the roof behind home plate provided space for the announcer and the press. Woodward named the field after himself, using his nickname and the first part of his last name.  It was the first concrete-and-steel stadium in the minors.\n\nWoodward invited Alabama Governor [[Braxton Bragg Comer]], Birmingham Mayor Culpepper Exum, civic leader, [[George B. Ward]] and Victor H. Hanson, publisher of ''[[The Birmingham News]]'', for opening day on August 18, 1910. The day was celebrated by businesses closing all over town to allow fans to fill the park for the first pitch at 3:30 P.M. Over 10,000 people attended that first game in which the Barons defeated the visiting Montgomery Climbers 3-2. Throughout the first half of the 20th century Rickwood Field hosted sellout crowds for both the Barons and the Black Barons, who played on alternate weekends.\n\nIn 1912 a spring [[tornado]] tore through the field, pulling up the outfield fence. Two years later Woodward felt the need to have electric fans installed in the grandstands for the comfort of the crowd. The [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] also made Rickwood Field their [[spring training]] home in [[1919 in baseball|1919]].\n\nRickwood Field also hosted [[college football]] games. From 1912 to 1927 the [[Alabama Crimson Tide]] played its Birmingham home dates in Rickwood.  In 1921 the outfield fence was damaged in a tornado and quickly rebuilt. In 1924\u20131927 the infield bleachers were covered with a steel-framed roof designed by Denham, VanKeuren & Denham, Architects of Birmingham. Shortly after, In 1928 a new [[Mission Revival Style architecture|Mission style]] entry structure with offices was built to the designs of Paul Wright & Co., Engineers of Birmingham. A new concrete outfield wall replaced the original fence.\n\nIn 1931 in the first game of the Dixie Series championship, Birmingham's 43-year-old [[Ray Caldwell]] outpitched 22-year-old [[Dizzy Dean]], who had guaranteed a win. The Barons won the series 4 games to 3. In 1936 four monumental steel-frame light towers designed and fabricated by the Truscon Steel Company of [[Youngstown, Ohio]] were erected, allowing for night games. In 1938, Woodward sold the park to Ed Norton, a local businessman. In 1940 Norton sold it to the Cincinnati Reds. At that time new outfield fences were built inside the original walls to reduce the field dimensions.  G. J. Jebeles of Birmingham purchased the park in 1944. A ladies' rest room was added and the outfield fence reduced again in 1948. In 1949 ownership changed hands again, going to a partnership of Al DeMent, Al Belcher, and Rufus Lackey. They added a small restaurant in the entrance building in 1950 and installed additional box seats, necessitating the relocations of the dugouts farther down the baselines. In 1958 Belcher gained a majority share and control of the park. In 1964 General Manager Glynn West purchased 1000 wooden seats from New York City's [[Polo Grounds]] and installed them at the park. Belcher sold Rickwood Field in 1966 to the City of Birmingham, but retained a lease for the remainder of that year.\n\nIn 1966 the lease was transferred to [[Charles O. Finley|Charlie Finley]], who brought the [[Oakland Athletics|Kansas City Athletics']] AA farm team to Birmingham for the 1967 season. That year is remembered for the day that 14,000 disappointed fans were sent home early when the [[Atlanta Braves]] vs. Southern League All-Stars exhibition game was called \"on account of tornado.\"  During this period, following a trend which swept [[minor league baseball]] (and which has since been largely reversed), the team took the name of the parent [[Major League Baseball|major league]] club and was known as the \"Birmingham A's\". Between 1979 and 1980 the wooden seats were replaced with plastic seats in the box areas and metal bleachers under the grandstands.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mercer|first=Chloe S.|author2=Melanie A.

He had a new electronic scoreboard installed at the park. In 1986, the Barons became the Chicago White Sox AA club, an affiliation that continues today.\n\nIn 1987 the Barons moved to a new facility, [[Hoover Metropolitan Stadium]], in the [[suburb]] of [[Hoover, Alabama|Hoover]].  They returned to Birmingham in 2013 with the opening of [[Regions Field]], just south of downtown Birmingham.\n\n==Current status==\nSince 1992 the ballpark has been under the care of the [http://www.rickwood.com Friends of Rickwood] who are restoring the facility to its former glory.

It was built for the [[Birmingham Barons]] in 1910 by industrialist and team-owner [[Rick Woodward]] and has served as the home park for the Birmingham Barons and the [[Birmingham Black Barons]] of the [[Negro League baseball|Negro Leagues]]. Though the Barons moved their home games to the Hoover Met in the suburbs, and most recently to [[Regions Field]] in Birmingham, Rickwood Field has been preserved and is undergoing gradual restoration as a \"working museum\" where baseball's history can be experienced. The Barons also play one regular season game a year at Rickwood Field.  Rickwood Field is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nris\"/>\n\n==History==\nThe Birmingham Coal Barons baseball team began playing professionally in 1887, with their home games at an informal park called \"Slag Pile Field\" in West End. In 1901 they joined the [[Southern Association]].\n\nAllen Harvey \"Rick\" Woodward, chairman of Woodward Iron Company and grandson of pioneer Birmingham industrialist Stimpson Harvey Woodward, purchased a majority share of the Birmingham Coal Barons baseball team from J. William McQueen in 1909 while he was still in his 20s. Immediately he began planning a grand showplace for his new team. He contacted [[Connie Mack]] for advice on the details, including the field dimensions. He settled on [[Shibe Park]] in [[Philadelphia]] (which was controlled by Mack's team and later renamed Connie Mack Stadium) and [[Forbes Field]] in [[Pittsburgh]] as the models for the new park. He purchased land in the West End neighborhood of Birmingham from the Alabama Central Railroad. The $75,000 structure was designed by Southeastern Engineering Company of Birmingham (a short-lived subsidiary of [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]]'s General Fireproofing Company) and completed during the summer of 1910. The 12.7 [[acre]] (51,000&nbsp;m\u00b2) park was flanked along the basepaths by concrete and steel stands. A tile-roofed cupola on the roof behind home plate provided space for the announcer and the press. Woodward named the field after himself, using his nickname and the first part of his last name.  It was the first concrete-and-steel stadium in the minors.\n\nWoodward invited Alabama Governor [[Braxton Bragg Comer]], Birmingham Mayor Culpepper Exum, civic leader, [[George B. Ward]] and Victor H. Hanson, publisher of ''[[The Birmingham News]]'', for opening day on August 18, 1910. The day was celebrated by businesses closing all over town to allow fans to fill the park for the first pitch at 3:30 P.M. Over 10,000 people attended that first game in which the Barons defeated the visiting Montgomery Climbers 3-2. Throughout the first half of the 20th century Rickwood Field hosted sellout crowds for both the Barons and the Black Barons, who played on alternate weekends.\n\nIn 1912 a spring [[tornado]] tore through the field, pulling up the outfield fence. Two years later Woodward felt the need to have electric fans installed in the grandstands for the comfort of the crowd. The [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] also made Rickwood Field their [[spring training]] home in [[1919 in baseball|1919]].\n\nRickwood Field also hosted [[college football]] games. From 1912 to 1927 the [[Alabama Crimson Tide]] played its Birmingham home dates in Rickwood.  In 1921 the outfield fence was damaged in a tornado and quickly rebuilt. In 1924\u20131927 the infield bleachers were covered with a steel-framed roof designed by Denham, VanKeuren & Denham, Architects of Birmingham. Shortly after, In 1928 a new [[Mission Revival Style architecture|Mission style]] entry structure with offices was built to the designs of Paul Wright & Co., Engineers of Birmingham. A new concrete outfield wall replaced the original fence.\n\nIn 1931 in the first game of the Dixie Series championship, Birmingham's 43-year-old [[Ray Caldwell]] outpitched 22-year-old [[Dizzy Dean]], who had guaranteed a win. The Barons won the series 4 games to 3. In 1936 four monumental steel-frame light towers designed and fabricated by the Truscon Steel Company of [[Youngstown, Ohio]] were erected, allowing for night games. In 1938, Woodward sold the park to Ed Norton, a local businessman. In 1940 Norton sold it to the Cincinnati Reds. At that time new outfield fences were built inside the original walls to reduce the field dimensions.  G. J. Jebeles of Birmingham purchased the park in 1944. A ladies' rest room was added and the outfield fence reduced again in 1948. In 1949 ownership changed hands again, going to a partnership of Al DeMent, Al Belcher, and Rufus Lackey. They added a small restaurant in the entrance building in 1950 and installed additional box seats, necessitating the relocations of the dugouts farther down the baselines. In 1958 Belcher gained a majority share and control of the park. In 1964 General Manager Glynn West purchased 1000 wooden seats from New York City's [[Polo Grounds]] and installed them at the park. Belcher sold Rickwood Field in 1966 to the City of Birmingham, but retained a lease for the remainder of that year.\n\nIn 1966 the lease was transferred to [[Charles O. Finley|Charlie Finley]], who brought the [[Oakland Athletics|Kansas City Athletics']] AA farm team to Birmingham for the 1967 season. That year is remembered for the day that 14,000 disappointed fans were sent home early when the [[Atlanta Braves]] vs. Southern League All-Stars exhibition game was called \"on account of tornado.\"  During this period, following a trend which swept [[minor league baseball]] (and which has since been largely reversed), the team took the name of the parent [[Major League Baseball|major league]] club and was known as the \"Birmingham A's\". Between 1979 and 1980 the wooden seats were replaced with plastic seats in the box areas and metal bleachers under the grandstands.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mercer|first=Chloe S.|author2=Melanie A.

He had a new electronic scoreboard installed at the park. In 1986, the Barons became the Chicago White Sox AA club, an affiliation that continues today.\n\nIn 1987 the Barons moved to a new facility, [[Hoover Metropolitan Stadium]], in the [[suburb]] of [[Hoover, Alabama|Hoover]].

It was recorded by the [[Historic American Buildings Survey]] in 1934 and 1935.  It was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on March 24, 1972, due to its architectural significance.<ref name=\"nris\"/>\n\n==History==\nThe Decatur branch of the Alabama State Bank opened its doors on July 29, 1833. It was authorized by the [[Alabama General Assembly]] in 1830 to be one of three branches of the Alabama State Bank. After outstanding debts of over $1 million were unable to be reformed the Decatur branch franchise was revoked. The building remained vacant until the 1860s when it was one of four buildings that survived the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] in [[Decatur, Alabama]].  During the [[Battle of Decatur]], the bank was used as headquarters for the [[Union Army|Union forces]] in the area and was also used as a hospital while battles raged outside.  Such evidence of the battle remains: bloodstains are visible in one of the three vaults and slugs from musket fire and [[Mini\u00e9 ball]]s are still clearly seen in the walls of the building.\n\nIn 1881, the [[First National Bank of Decatur|First National Bank]] opened its doors in the Old State Bank building.  But, when First National Bank completed its new office in 1902, the bank building was used as a residence and office by J. Y. Cantwell.  After signs of deterioration began to show themselves, Cantwell's grand niece, W. B. Edmundson, deeded the building over to the City of Decatur in 1933.  Management of the structure was vested in an eight-member Board of Governors.  The petition for restoration was presented to the Civil Works Administration and restoration commenced.  Being one of only a handful of local buildings to survive the destruction of the [[American Civil War]], and after going through the many changes over the years, the Old State Bank has become a symbol of historical significance.\n\nBy the year 1946, the building was deeded by its owner to the Morgan County [[American Legion]], Post No. 15.  At some point, the original bank building was completely obscured by a brick facade which also enclosed the front portico and columns.  The appearance was simply a huge, ugly, brick warehouse and, by the early 1970s, the original history was long forgotten.  As part of a plan to remove aging, blighted buildings, a demolition crew was contracted to tear down the old building with a wrecking ball.  It was soon obvious that something unusual was present when the wrecking ball could tear right through the front wall at some places, but the heavy ball bounced off other spots.  The invincible spots were found to be the five limestone columns hidden behind bricks for generations.  (A few of the columns still carry wrecking ball scars.)  The project to demolish the old, blighted warehouse quickly transformed into restoring this centerpiece of a newly formed historical district.\n\n[[File:Alabama winter 2008.jpg|thumb|left|The fountains in front of the Old State Bank frozen in winter 2008.]]\n\nIn 1972, the Old State Bank was named to the National Register of Historical Places at the age of 139 years.  Three years later, in 1975, the American Legion, Post No. 15, donated the Old State Bank building to the City of Decatur.  Plans for restoration were put together in the year 1976, as the bank turned 143 years old, and was put under the control of the Old Bank Board members.  Restoration of the bank was finished in the year 1983, at the age of 150. In 1984, a curator was appointed, and daily tours were implemented.  The second wave of detailed restoration was undertaken in the years of 1995-1996 and was led by noted preservation architect, Harvie Jones.  Funding was provided by the Alabama Historical Commission, the City of Decatur, and the Old Bank Board of Directors.  The City of Decatur commemorated the bank's 175th anniversary in 2008.\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe architecture of the bank shows the influence of [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s fusion of [[Palladian architecture|Palladianism]] with [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] temple forms. The five limestone columns across the front weigh 100-150 tons each and were mined in nearby [[Trinity, Alabama|Trinity]]. The pentastyle portico is highly unusual.<ref name=\"gamble\">{{cite book |title=Historic architecture in Alabama: a guide to styles and types, 1810-1930 |last=Gamble |first=Robert |year=1990 |publisher=University of Alabama Press |location=Tuscaloosa, Alabama |isbn=0-8173-1134-3 |page=53 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|United States}}\n*[[National Register of Historic Places listings in Morgan County, Alabama]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.decaturparks.com/account.php?accountid=45 Old State Bank] - Decatur Parks and Recreation Department\n*{{Commons category-inline|Old State Bank}}\n*{{HABS |survey=AL-348 |id=al0668 |title=State Bank of Alabama, Decatur Branch, Bank Street & Wilson Avenue, Decatur, Morgan County, AL |photos=6 |dwgs=9 |data=4 |cap=1 |supp=yes}}\n\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Decatur, Alabama]]\n[[Category:Parks in Decatur, Alabama]]\n[[Category:National Register of Historic Places in Morgan County, Alabama]]\n[[Category:Historic American Buildings Survey in Alabama]]\n[[Category:Palladian Revival architecture in Alabama]]\n[[Category:Alabama in the American Civil War]]\n[[Category:Historic bank buildings in the United States]]\n[[Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1833]]\n[[Category:Bank buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Alabama]]\n", "text_old": "{{more citations needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n{{Infobox NRHP\n  | name =State Bank Building, Decatur Branch\n  | nrhp_type = \n  | image = Old State Bank Decatur July 2010 02.jpg\n  | caption = \n  | location= 925 Bank St., NE, [[Decatur, Alabama]]\n  | coordinates = {{coord|34|36|52|N|86|59|1|W|display=inline,title}}\n| locmapin =\n  | area =\n  | built =1833\n  | architect= Jefferson Steelflex\n  | architecture= [[Jeffersonian architecture|Jeffersonian]]\n  | added = March 24, 1972\n  | governing_body = Private\n  | refnum=72000176<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|2008a}}</ref>\n}}\nThe '''State Bank Building, Decatur Branch''', commonly known as the '''Old State Bank''', is a historic [[Jeffersonian architecture|Jeffersonian]]-style bank building in [[Decatur, Alabama]], [[United States]].

During the [[Battle of Decatur]], the bank was used as headquarters for the [[Union Army|Union forces]] in the area and was also used as a hospital while battles raged outside.  Such evidence of the battle remains: bloodstains are visible in one of the three vaults and slugs from musket fire and [[Mini\u00e9 ball]]s are still clearly seen in the walls of the building.\n\nIn 1881, the [[First National Bank of Decatur|First National Bank]] opened its doors in the Old State Bank building.  But, when First National Bank completed its new office in 1902, the bank building was used as a residence and office by J. Y. Cantwell.  After signs of deterioration began to show themselves, Cantwell's grand niece, W. B. Edmundson, deeded the building over to the City of Decatur in 1933.  Management of the structure was vested in an eight-member Board of Governors.  The petition for restoration was presented to the Civil Works Administration and restoration commenced.  Being one of only a handful of local buildings to survive the destruction of the [[American Civil War]], and after going through the many changes over the years, the Old State Bank has become a symbol of historical significance.\n\nBy the year 1946, the building was deeded by its owner to the Morgan County [[American Legion]], Post No. 15.  At some point, the original bank building was completely obscured by a brick facade which also enclosed the front portico and columns.  The appearance was simply a huge, ugly, brick warehouse and, by the early 1970s, the original history was long forgotten.  As part of a plan to remove aging, blighted buildings, a demolition crew was contracted to tear down the old building with a wrecking ball.  It was soon obvious that something unusual was present when the wrecking ball could tear right through the front wall at some places, but the heavy ball bounced off other spots.  The invincible spots were found to be the five limestone columns hidden behind bricks for generations.  (A few of the columns still carry wrecking ball scars.)  The project to demolish the old, blighted warehouse quickly transformed into restoring this centerpiece of a newly formed historical district.\n\n[[File:Alabama winter 2008.jpg|thumb|left|The fountains in front of the Old State Bank frozen in winter 2008.]]\n\nIn 1972, the Old State Bank was named to the National Register of Historical Places at the age of 139 years.  Three years later, in 1975, the American Legion, Post No. 15, donated the Old State Bank building to the City of Decatur.  Plans for restoration were put together in the year 1976, as the bank turned 143 years old, and was put under the control of the Old Bank Board members.  Restoration of the bank was finished in the year 1983, at the age of 150. In 1984, a curator was appointed, and daily tours were implemented.  The second wave of detailed restoration was undertaken in the years of 1995-1996 and was led by noted preservation architect, Harvie Jones.  Funding was provided by the Alabama Historical Commission, the City of Decatur, and the Old Bank Board of Directors.  The City of Decatur commemorated the bank's 175th anniversary in 2008.\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe architecture of the bank shows the influence of [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s fusion of [[Palladian architecture|Palladianism]] with [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] temple forms. The five limestone columns across the front weigh 100-150 tons each and were mined in nearby [[Trinity, Alabama|Trinity]]. The pentastyle portico is highly unusual.<ref name=\"gamble\">{{cite book |title=Historic architecture in Alabama: a guide to styles and types, 1810-1930 |last=Gamble |first=Robert |year=1990 |publisher=University of Alabama Press |location=Tuscaloosa, Alabama |isbn=0-8173-1134-3 |page=53 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|United States}}\n*[[National Register of Historic Places listings in Morgan County, Alabama]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.decaturparks.com/account.php?accountid=45 Old State Bank] - Decatur Parks and Recreation Department\n*{{Commonscat-inline|Old State Bank}}\n*{{HABS |survey=AL-348 |id=al0668 |title=State Bank of Alabama, Decatur Branch, Bank Street & Wilson Avenue, Decatur, Morgan County, AL |photos=6 |dwgs=9 |data=4 |cap=1 |supp=yes}}\n\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Decatur, Alabama]]\n[[Category:Parks in Decatur, Alabama]]\n[[Category:Landmarks in Alabama]]\n[[Category:National Register of Historic Places in Morgan County, Alabama]]\n[[Category:Historic American Buildings Survey in Alabama]]\n[[Category:Palladian Revival architecture in Alabama]]\n[[Category:Alabama in the American Civil War]]\n[[Category:Historic bank buildings in the United States]]\n[[Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1833]]\n[[Category:Bank buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Alabama]]\n", "name_user": "Hmains", "label": "safe", "comment": "category refine, sort sequence", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_State_Bank_(Decatur,_Alabama)"}

He is a pet dinosaur of the series' main characters, [[Fred Flintstone|Fred]] and [[Wilma Flintstone]].<ref>{{cite news|title= The Flintstones' 50th anniversary: 15 things you don't know|work= Daily Telegraph |date=2010-09-30|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8034627/The-Flintstones-50th-anniversary-15-things-you-dont-know.html|accessdate=2010-10-01|location=London|first=Heidi|last=Blake}}</ref> Dino debuted in the opening credits of the pilot episode of ''The Flintstones'', but is not mentioned by name until the first season's fourth episode, \"No Help Wanted.\"\n\n==Background==\nIn the series, Dino serves the role of a pet dog, and exhibits the characteristics of a typical domesticated canine.\n\nDino is a [[prosauropod]]-like [[dinosaur]], a Snorkasaurus. Dino is a relatively small dinosaur, only slightly larger than the humans of his time, smaller than [[mammoth]]s that appear in the series, and much smaller than the numerous sauropods that appear as work animals in the series (a full-sized sauropod appears as a crane in the opening sequence, and oversized \"[[Brontosaurus|bronto]] ribs\" the size of an automobile are seen in the closing credits).\n\nA recurring gag in the series is Fred coming home from work, and Dino gets excited and knocks him down and licks his face. But no matter how hard he tries to the contrary, Fred usually gives in to Dino's ticklish and wet doglike kisses. Dino frequently exhibits human emotions, nearly \"talking,\" and can also be moved to anger, at which point he snarls and snaps, especially when Fred tries to lie either to or in front of him, which he can always tell. He also loves to play with [[Pebbles Flintstone|Pebbles]] and [[Bamm-Bamm Rubble|Bamm-Bamm]], the Flintstones' and Rubbles' respective offspring; these characters are introduced in the middle part of the series. In the episode \"Hop Happy\" Dino meets Hoppy, the Rubbles' new pet hopperoo. At first, Dino and Fred get scared, thinking he's a giant mouse, but they eventually become best friends after Hoppy helps Dino rescue their owners in an accident.\n\nAlthough he is usually immune, Dino does take a couple of brief stabs at romance.  The first comes in the episode, \"Dino Goes Hollyrock\", which originally aired on September 14, 1962.  In it, Dino falls in love with female TV star sauropod \"Sassie\" (an obvious takeoff on \"[[Lassie (1954 TV series)|Lassie]]\") and then becomes her co-star on her TV show.  However, after she removes her false eyelashes and wig, he is shocked that she turned out to be an ugly, talented sauropod that could be beautified.  The second comes in the episode, \"Dino and Juliet\", which originally aired on November 26, 1964.  In it, Dino falls in love with the new neighbor's female sauropod (Juliet).  Their romance, which results in the birth of 15 puppies, helps end the feud between Fred and the new neighbor, Mr. Loudrock.\n\nAlthough Dino had already appeared earlier in the series' first season (such as the episode \"No Help Wanted\" and \"Arthur Quarry's Dance Class\" - these episodes were made after the \"Snorkasaurus Hunter\" but aired before), Dino is portrayed quite differently in the first season's 18th episode \"The Snorkasaurus Hunter.\" In this episode, Fred and his friend [[Barney Rubble]] are on a camping trip, trying to hunt a snorkasaurus. Unlike Dino's other appearances, the snorkasaurus in this episode speaks and behaves toward Fred and Barney in a manner similar to comedian [[Phil Silvers]]. At the end of the episode, the Flintstones take in the dinosaur; the snorkasaurus (called \"Dino\" at one point by Wilma) is seen acting like a butler for the Flintstones: answering the telephone, dusting, and ironing. Dino in this episode also has purple skin instead of his varying pink-to-red color, which seems to vary from episode-to-episode during this early period, but is permanently purple after this episode. After this episode, Dino is permanently portrayed as behaving in a doglike fashion.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0580278/</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.topthat.net/webrock/faq/faq10.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513034318/http://www.topthat.net/webrock/faq/faq10.htm |archivedate=2012-05-13 }}</ref>\n\nDino's origins are explained in the episode \"Dino Disappears\", which originally aired on October 10, 1963.  In it, Wilma states that Dino followed Fred home because Fred was playing with him.  Fred counters by saying he was merely trying to chase him away. This seems to refer to the episode \"Snorkasaurus Hunter\" where Fred and Barney's playing was actually hunting him down and Dino's following him was actually Dino sneaking onto the car.\n\nPost-original series, Dino appears in most of the series' spinoffs, except during the first season of ''[[The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show]]''. There, Dino is replaced by Wooly, a dwarf mammoth, as the Flintstone family's pet. However, starting with the following series' ''[[The Flintstone Comedy Hour]]'', Dino once again becomes a regular character.\n\nIn the 1980-1982 series ''[[The Flintstone Comedy Show (1980 TV series)|The Flintstone Comedy Show]]'', Dino is featured in his own segment, \"[[The Flintstone Comedy Show (1980 TV series)#Dino and Cavemouse|Dino and Cavemouse]],\" where Dino tries futilely to capture a pesky [[mouse]] in the Flintstone household. The segments bear some similarities to classic cat-and-mouse cartoons such as ''[[Tom and Jerry]]''. Dino later appears as a puppy in 1986-1988 series ''[[The Flintstone Kids]]'' (including his own segment, \"Dino's Dilemmas\"), as Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm's babysitter in the short-lived 1996 series ''[[Cave Kids]]'', and also starred in his own two 7-minute short cartoons, ''[[Dino: Stay Out!]]'' (1995) and ''[[Dino: The Great Egg-Scape]]'' (1997).\n\n==Other media==\n[[File:Dino Harikalar Diyari Flintstones 06029 nevit.jpg|thumbnail|right|Dino statue (right), along with [[Fred Flintstone]] (left).]]\nDino appears in both live-action movies. He isn't seen very often in the first film, 1994's ''[[The Flintstones (film)|The Flintstones]]''. Dino was created with both computer-generated imagery and as a puppet from [[Jim Henson's Creature Shop]], while archival audio from the original series was used to serve as Dino's voice.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nHowever, in the second film, 2000's ''[[The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas]]'', Dino has more screen time; he appears here as a puppy. Fred won Dino's egg as a prize after winning a carnival game. Initially, Fred didn't think much of the egg as he felt that the creatures inside never live long. On a [[Ferris wheel]], just as Fred and Wilma are about to kiss, Dino's egg hatches and he takes an immediate attachment to Fred, believing him to be his mother. (This, of course, contradicts Dino's origin in the original series.)\n\n==Filmography==\n===Television shows===\n* ''[[The Flintstones]]'' (1960\u20131966)\n* ''[[The Flintstone Comedy Hour]]'' (1972\u20131974)\n* ''[[Fred Flintstone and Friends]]'' (1977\u20131978)\n* ''[[The New Fred and Barney Show]]'' (1979)\n* ''[[Fred and Barney Meet the Thing]]'' (1979)\n* ''[[Fred and Barney Meet the Shmoo]]'' (1979\u20131980)\n* ''[[The Flintstone Comedy Show]]'' (1980\u20131982)\n* ''[[The Flintstone Funnies]]'' (1982\u20131984)\n* ''[[The Flintstone Kids]]'' (1986\u20131988)\n* ''[[What a Cartoon!]]'' \u2013 featuring ''[[Dino: Stay Out!]]'' (1995) and ''[[Dino: The Great Egg-Scape]]'' (1997)\n* ''[[Cave Kids]]'' (1996)\n* ''[[Yabba-Dabba Dinosaurs]]'' (2020)\n\n===Films and Specials===\n* ''[[The Man Called Flintstone]]'' (1966)\n* ''[[Energy: A National Issue]]'' (1977)\n* ''[[A Flintstone Christmas]]'' (1977)\n* ''[[The Flintstones: Little Big League]]'' (1978)\n* ''[[The Flintstones: Fred's Final Fling]]'' (1980)\n* ''[[The Flintstones: Wind-Up Wilma]]'' (1981)\n* ''[[The Flintstones: Jogging Fever]]'' (1981)\n* ''[[The Jetsons Meet the Flintstones]]'' (1987)\n* ''[[The Flintstone Kids' \"Just Say No\" Special]]'' (1988)\n* ''[[Hanna-Barbera's 50th: A Yabba Dabba Doo Celebration|A Yabba Dabba Doo Celebration: 50 Years of Hanna-Barbera]]'' (1989)\n* ''[[I Yabba-Dabba Do!]]'' (1993)\n* ''[[Hollyrock-a-Bye Baby]]'' (1993)\n* ''[[A Flintstone Family Christmas]]'' (1993)\n* ''[[The Flintstones (film)|The Flintstones]]'' (1994)\n* ''[[A Flintstones Christmas Carol]]'' (1994)\n* ''[[The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas]]'' (2000)\n* ''[[The Flintstones: On the Rocks]]'' (2001)\n* ''[[The Flintstones & WWE: Stone Age SmackDown!]]'' (2015)\n\n==Portrayal==\nDino's barks and sound effects were provided by [[Mel Blanc]] for 27 years, from 1960\u20131987; archive audio of Blanc was used for Dino in the [[The Flintstones (film)|1994 live-action film]] and [[The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas|its prequel in 2000]].

[[Specific Area Message Encoding]] (SAME) product codes assigned to each term for [[NOAA Weather Radio]] (NWR) broadcasts are included in parentheses following the title of the described alert type if used; products that do not have a specified code are identified where applicable as Non-Precipitation Warnings/Watches/Advisories (NPW), Coastal Flood Warnings/Watches/Advisories (CFW), Marine Weather Statement (MWS), Surf Discussion (SRD) or Winter Weather Warnings/Watches/Advisories (WSW) as defined by NOAA.\n\n==Definitions of severe weather alerts==\nThe NWS divides severe weather alerts into several types of hazardous/hydrologic events:\n:# '''Severe local storms''' \u2013 Short-fused, small-scale hazardous weather or hydrologic events produced by [[thunderstorm]]s (including large [[hail]], damaging [[wind]]s, [[tornado]]es, and [[flash flood]]s).\n:# '''Winter storms''' \u2013 Weather hazards associated with freezing or frozen precipitation ([[freezing rain]], [[ice pellets|sleet]], and/or [[snow]]), or combined effects of winter precipitation and strong winds.\n:# '''Fire weather''' \u2013 Weather conditions that contribute to an increased risk and help cause the spread of [[wildfire]]s.\n:# '''Flooding''' \u2013 Hazardous hydrological events resulting in temporary inundation of land areas not normally covered by water, often caused by excessive rainfall.\n:# '''Coastal/lakeshore hazards''' \u2013 Hydrological hazards that may affect property, marine or leisure activities in areas near ocean and lake waters including high surf and coastal or lakeshore flooding, as well as rip currents.\n:# '''Marine hazards''' \u2013 Hazardous events that may affect marine travel, fishing and shipping interests along large bodies of water, including hazardous seas and freezing spray.\n:# '''Tropical cyclone hazards''' \u2013 Hazardous tropical cyclone events that may affect property in inland areas or marine activities in coastal waters, resulting in wind damage, [[storm surge]], tornadoes and flooding rain.\n:# '''Non-precipitation hazards''' \u2013 Weather hazards not directly associated with any of the above including extreme heat or cold, dense [[fog]], high winds, and river or lakeshore flooding.\n\n===Severe local storms===\n[[File:NWS_Weather_Map_Example_3.jpg|thumb|right|400px|An example of weather alerts on a national map from the National Weather Service.]]\n*'''[[Tornado watch|Tornado Watch]]''' (TOA; '''yellow box''' in some select NWS documentation, '''red box''' in most other media) \u2013 Conditions are favorable for the development of severe thunderstorms and [[tornado]]es in and close to the watch area.

This enhanced form of a tornado warning is issued mainly by Weather Forecast Offices within the National Weather Service's Central and Southern Region Headquarters; a tornado emergency is the highest level of a three-tiered Impact Based Warning system for tornadoes used by all WFOs within the Central Region Headquarters, and eight others within the Eastern, Southern and Western Regions.<ref name=IBW/><ref name=\"nws-svrrsrcs\"/>\n*'''[[Severe thunderstorm watch|Severe Thunderstorm Watch]]''' (SVA; '''pink box''' or '''blue box''' in NWS documents, typically '''yellow box''' in other media) \u2013 Conditions are favorable for the development of severe thunderstorms in and close to the watch area.

These warnings are currently issued on a polygonal basis, are usually issued for a duration of 30 minutes to one hour, and can be issued without a Severe Thunderstorm Watch being already in effect. Because severe thunderstorms can produce tornadoes with little or no advance warning, a Severe Thunderstorm Warning may be upgraded to a Tornado Warning if strong rotation is indicated or a tornado is sighted.

First issued in February 2018 (for a severe [[derecho]] impacting areas near [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]]), the National Weather Service does not currently maintain a concrete criteria for issuance, although Weather Forecast Offices that issue or have issued such warnings may use the same criteria meriting a PDS Severe Thunderstorm Warning to indicate life-threatening severe weather conditions that will impact a densely populated area.\n*'''[[Significant weather advisory|Significant Weather Advisory]]''' (SPS; alt.: '''Significant Weather Alert''') \u2013 A strong thunderstorm below severe criteria, containing small hail below {{convert|1|in|cm}} diameter, and/or strong winds of {{convert|39|\u2013|57|mph|km/h}}, is indicated by Doppler weather radar and may create some adverse impacts on travel. These advisories are issued as Special Weather Statements written in the style of severe thunderstorm and other short-fused warnings, usually on a county by county (or [[County (United States)#County equivalents|equivalent]] thereof) basis. Some areas use an entirely different format (most notably WFOs in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and [[Mid-Atlantic United States|Mid-Atlantic]]), denoting which locations in each county will be affected by the thunderstorm.\n* '''Severe Weather Statement''' (SVS) \u2013 A statement issued to provide updated information for active severe thunderstorm and tornado warnings to the public and emergency managers, with revised information including reports of observed severe weather and the severe thunderstorm's most recent location at the time of the statement's issuance.

A flash flood is a flood that occurs within six hours of excessive rainfall and poses a threat to life and/or property, especially in low-lying or flood prone areas (including urban areas with poor drainage, rivers and streams); ice jams and dam failures can also cause flash floods. These warnings are issued on a county by county (or equivalent thereof) basis by the local Weather Forecast Office and are generally in effect for two to six hours, although particularly during tropical cyclones a warning may last for a longer period of time, and occasionally last shorter than two hours.<ref name=\"nws-wtrrsrcs\">{{cite web|title=NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE INSTRUCTION 10-922: WEATHER FORECAST OFFICE WATER RESOURCES PRODUCTS SPECIFICATION|url=https://www.nws.noaa.gov/directives/sym/pd01009022curr.pdf|website=National Weather Service Analyze, Forecast, and Support Office|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=December 6, 2019|access-date=January 7, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=National Weather Service glossary: Flash Flood Warning|url=https://forecast-v3.weather.gov/glossary?search=Flash+Flood+Warning|website=National Weather Service|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=June 25, 2009|access-date=October 25, 2009}}</ref>\n*:'''Particularly Dangerous Situation Flash Flood Warning''' (FFW) \u2013 Issued within the initial flash flood warning or as a complete re-issuance of the previously issued warning, this indicates widespread, life-threatening flash flooding\u2014caused by excessive rainfall, ice jams or imminent dam failures\u2014has been indicated by Doppler weather radar, emergency personnel or trained observers over a broadly populated area.\n*:'''Flash Flood Emergency''' (FFS) \u2013 A flash flood emergency is a high-end usage of the flash flood warning product.

The National Weather Service uses a multi-tier system of weather statements to notify the public of threatening weather conditions. These statements are used in conjunction with specific weather phenomena to convey different levels of risk. In order of increasing risk, these statements are:\n*'''Outlook''' \u2013 A Hazardous Weather Outlook is issued daily to indicate that a hazardous weather or hydrologic event may occur in the next seven days. Each segment of the product will contain sections outlining hazardous weather in the short term (through Day 1) and long term (for Days 2-7), and spotter information. The outlook will include information about potential severe thunderstorms, heavy rain or flooding, winter weather, extremes of heat or cold, etc., that may develop over the next seven days with an emphasis on the first 24 hours of the forecast. It is intended to provide information to those who need considerable lead time to prepare for the event (such as [[emergency management]] agencies, Skywarn spotters and media outlets). If issued for a coastal area, the outlook will contain two segments: one for the marine zones and adjacent land-based (i.e., coastal) zones, and the other for the remainder of the land-based zones.<ref>{{cite web|title=National Weather Service glossary: Outlook|url=https://forecast-v3.weather.gov/glossary?search=Outlook|website=National Weather Service|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=June 25, 2009|access-date=October 25, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Weather Watch, Warning and Advisory Criteria|url=https://www.weather.gov/lwx/WarningsDefined|website=[[National Weather Service Baltimore/Washington|National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office Baltimore/Washington]]|access-date=January 7, 2020}}</ref>\n*'''Advisory''' \u2013 An advisory is issued when a hazardous weather or hydrologic event is occurring, imminent, or likely.

The National Weather Service may activate weather spotters in areas affected by advisories to help them better track and analyze the event.<ref>{{cite web|title=National Weather Service glossary: Advisory|url=https://forecast-v3.weather.gov/glossary?search=Advisory|website=National Weather Service|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=June 25, 2009|access-date=October 25, 2009}}</ref>\n*'''Emergency''' \u2013 An Emergency is issued when an event that by itself cannot pose a threat to life or property, but may indirectly cause other events to happen that may pose a threat to life or property. An example of this would be a [[power outage]], which although not directly posing a hazard, may threaten public safety and critical services.

It is intended to provide enough lead time so those who need to set their plans in motion can do so. A watch means that hazardous weather is possible. People should have a plan of action in case a storm threatens and they should listen for later information and possible warnings especially when planning travel or outdoor activities.

Several common scales are described below.\n\n===Hail diameter sizes===\n{{main|Hail}}\nThe size of individual hailstones that reach surface level is determined by speed of the updraft which create the individual ice crystals at atmospheric levels. Larger hailstones are capable of producing damage to property, and particularly with very large hailstones, resulting in serious injury or death due to blunt-force trauma induced by the impact of the hailstones. Hailstone size is typically correspondent to the size of an object for comparative purposes.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| '''Hailstone size''' || '''Measurement ([[inch|in]])''' || '''Measurement ([[centimeter|cm]])''' || '''Updraft Speed (mph)''' || '''Updraft Speed (m/s)'''\n|-\n| [[pea]] || 0.25 || 0.6 || 40 || 18\n|-\n| [[penny (United States coin)|penny]] || 0.75 || 1.9 || 44 || 20\n|-\n| [[quarter (United States coin)|quarter]]* || 1.00 || 2.5 || 49 || 22\n|-\n| [[half dollar (United States coin)|half dollar]] || 1.25 || 3.2 || 54 || 24\n|-\n| [[walnut]] || 1.50 || 3.8 || 60 || 27\n|-\n| [[golf ball]] || 1.75 || 4.4 || 64 || 29\n|-\n| hen egg\u2020 || 2.00 || 5.1 || 69 || 31\n|-\n| [[tennis ball]] || 2.50 || 6.4 || 77 || 34\n|-\n| [[Baseball (ball)|baseball]] || 2.75 || 7.0 || 81 || 36\n|-\n| [[teacup|tea cup]] || 3 || 7.6 || 84 || 38\n|-\n| [[grapefruit]] || 4 || 10.1 || 98 || 44\n|-\n| [[softball]] || 4.50 || 11.4 || 103 || 46\n|-\n|}\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> <small>Begins hail sizes within the severe hail criterion.</small><br>\n\u2020 <small>Begins hail sizes within the [[Storm Prediction Center]]'s significant severe criterion.</small>\n\n===Beaufort wind scale===\n{{main|Beaufort scale}}\nThe '''Beaufort scale''' is an empirical measure that correlates wind speed to observed conditions at sea or on land.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| '''Wind category''' || '''Beaufort number''' || '''Wind speed''' || '''Conditions'''\n|-\n| [[Wind advisory|Advisory]]-force || 6 || 25\u201331&nbsp;mph<br/>(40\u201350&nbsp;km/h) || Large branches in motion; whistling in [[telephone]] wires.\n|-\n| Advisory-force || 7 || 32\u201338&nbsp;mph<br/>(51\u201362&nbsp;km/h) || Whole trees in motion; inconvenience felt walking against wind.\n|-\n| [[Gale]]-force || 8\u20139 || 39\u201354&nbsp;mph<br/>(63\u201388&nbsp;km/h) || Twigs break off trees; wind generally impedes progress.

The scale spans from Category 1 (winds of at least {{convert|74|mph|km/h}}) to Category 5 (exceeding {{convert|156|mph|km/h}}). Unlike the Enhanced Fujita Scale, which assigns ratings for tornadoes after damage has been incurred and thoroughly assessed, categories on the Saffir-Simpson scale are assigned to most active cyclones that reach the minimum hurricane threshold, even before landfall.\n\n<!--\nPLEASE NOTE: Intensity of example hurricanes is at time of landfall AND peak intensity.

Authorized officials may recommend evacuation or medical treatment of exposed persons in nearby areas.\n*'''Radiological Hazard Warning''' (RHW) \u2013 Indicates the loss, discovery, theft or release of a radiological hazard.\n*'''Shelter in Place Warning''' (SPW) \u2013 Indicates an event (such as the release of hazardous materials containing toxic fumes or radioactivity harmful to residents in the warning area) in which the public is recommended to shelter in place and take necessary safety precautions.\n*'''Tsunami Watch''' (TSA) \u2013 A tsunami is forecast to impact the specified area.\n*'''Tsunami Warning''' (TSW) \u2013 A tsunami with the potential of causing widespread coastal flooding accompanied by powerful currents and inundation and/or significant damage to adjacent property is imminent, expected or occurring and may continue for several hours after the wave's initial arrival.\n*'''Tsunami Advisory''' \u2013 A tsunami with the potential to generate strong currents or waves dangerous to those in or very near the water is imminent, expected, or occurring. The threat may continue for several hours after initial arrival, but significant inundation of land and adjacent property is not expected.\n*'''[[Volcano warning schemes of the United States|Volcano Warning]]''' (VOW) \u2013 Indicates volcanic activity that is ongoing or imminent.\n\n==Wind and tropical cyclones==\nWind alerting is classified into groups of two Beaufort numbers, beginning at 6\u20137 for the lowest class of wind advisories. The last group includes three Beaufort numbers, 14\u201316. The actual alerts can be categorized into three classes: maritime wind warnings, land wind warnings, and [[tropical storm watch|tropical cyclone warnings]]. Advisory-force and gale-force winds will not trigger a separate wind advisory or warning if a [[Blizzard warning]] is already in effect. However, as seen with [[Hurricane Sandy]], if widespread high wind warnings are in effect prior to the issuance of a blizzard warning, the high wind warnings may be continued.\n\n===Wind alert terms and signals===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| '''Wind speed''' || '''Marine or Beach Hazard Warning''' || '''Land Warning''' || '''Tropical Cyclone Warning(s)''' || '''Flags''' || '''Lights''' || '''Beaufort force'''\n|-\n| 25 to 38&nbsp;mph (22 to 33 knots) || [[Small craft advisory]]<ref>{{cite web|title=National Weather Service glossary: Small Craft Advisory|url=https://forecast-v3.weather.gov/glossary?search=Small+Craft+Advisory|website=National Weather Service|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=June 25, 2009|access-date=October 25, 2009}}</ref> || [[Wind Advisory]] || Wind Advisory or Small craft advisory || [[File:Small craft warning (USA).jpg]] || [[File:smallcraftlights.gif]] || 6\u20137\n|-\n| 39 to 54&nbsp;mph (34 to 47 knots) || [[Gale warning]]<ref>{{cite web|title=National Weather Service glossary: Gale Warning|url=https://forecast-v3.weather.gov/glossary?search=Gale+Warning|website=National Weather Service|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=June 25, 2009| access-date=October 25, 2009}}</ref> || [[High wind warning]] || [[Tropical cyclone warnings and watches#Tropical Storm Warning|Tropical storm warning]]* || [[File:Gale warning (USA).jpg]] || [[File:galelights.gif]] || 8\u20139\n|-\n| 55 to 73&nbsp;mph (48 to 63 knots) || [[Storm warning]]<ref>{{cite web|title=National Weather Service glossary: Storm Warning|url=https://forecast-v3.weather.gov/glossary?search=Storm+Warning|website=National Weather Service|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=June 25, 2009| access-date=October 25, 2009}}</ref> || High wind warning || Tropical storm warning\u2020 || [[File:Storm warning (USA).jpg]] || [[File:stormlights.gif]] || 10\u201311\n|-\n| 74\u2013110&nbsp;mph (64 to 99 knots) || [[Hurricane force wind warning|Hurricane Force Wind Warning]]<ref>{{cite web|website=National Weather Service|date=June 25, 2009|access-date=October 25, 2009|title=National Weather Service glossary: Hurricane Force Wind Warning|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration| url=https://forecast-v3.weather.gov/glossary?search=Hurricane+Force+Wind+Warning}}</ref> || High wind warning || [[Tropical cyclone warnings and watches#Hurricane Warning|Hurricane warning]] || [[File:Hurricane warning (USA).jpg]] || [[File:hurricanelights.gif]] || 12\u201313\n|-\n| Over 110&nbsp;mph (100+ knots) || Hurricane Force Wind Warning || [[Extreme wind warning]] || Hurricane warning and [[Extreme wind warning]]\u2021 || none || none || 14\u201316\n|-\n|}\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> {{small|Tropical Storm Warning flags and lights will always be displayed the same as Storm Warning flags and lights.}}<br>\n\u2020 {{small|A tropical storm with winds in this range is sometimes referred to as a \"severe tropical storm\".}}<br>\n\u2021 {{small|The Extreme Wind Warning is issued shortly before the [[eyewall]] makes landfall}}\n\n==Hazardous weather risks==\nThe various weather conditions described above have different levels of risk. The National Weather Service uses a multi-tier system of weather statements to notify the public of threatening weather conditions. These statements are used in conjunction with specific weather phenomena to convey different levels of risk. In order of increasing risk, these statements are:\n*'''Outlook''' \u2013 A Hazardous Weather Outlook is issued daily to indicate that a hazardous weather or hydrologic event may occur in the next seven days. Each segment of the product will contain sections outlining hazardous weather in the short term (through Day 1) and long term (for Days 2-7), and spotter information. The outlook will include information about potential severe thunderstorms, heavy rain or flooding, winter weather, extremes of heat or cold, etc., that may develop over the next seven days with an emphasis on the first 24 hours of the forecast. It is intended to provide information to those who need considerable lead time to prepare for the event (such as [[emergency management]] agencies, Skywarn spotters and media outlets). If issued for a coastal area, the outlook will contain two segments: one for the marine zones and adjacent land-based (i.e., coastal) zones, and the other for the remainder of the land-based zones.<ref>{{cite web|title=National Weather Service glossary: Outlook|url=https://forecast-v3.weather.gov/glossary?search=Outlook|website=National Weather Service|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=June 25, 2009|access-date=October 25, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Weather Watch, Warning and Advisory Criteria|url=https://www.weather.gov/lwx/WarningsDefined|website=[[National Weather Service Baltimore/Washington|National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office Baltimore/Washington]]|access-date=January 7, 2020}}</ref>\n*'''Advisory''' \u2013 An advisory is issued when a hazardous weather or hydrologic event is occurring, imminent, or likely. Advisories are for \"less serious\" conditions than warnings that may cause significant inconvenience, and if caution is not exercised could lead to situations that may threaten life or property. The National Weather Service may activate weather spotters in areas affected by advisories to help them better track and analyze the event.<ref>{{cite web|title=National Weather Service glossary: Advisory|url=https://forecast-v3.weather.gov/glossary?search=Advisory|website=National Weather Service|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=June 25, 2009|access-date=October 25, 2009}}</ref>\n*'''Emergency''' \u2013 An Emergency is issued when an event that by itself cannot pose a threat to life or property, but may indirectly cause other events to happen that may pose a threat to life or property. An example of this would be a [[power outage]], which although not directly posing a hazard, may threaten public safety and critical services. The only existing exceptions to this are the '''[[tornado emergency]]''' and '''[[flash flood emergency]]''', which are issued to get the attention of the public to a major tornado or flash flood.<ref name=\"nws.noaa.gov\">{{cite web|title=Emergency Alert System (EAS) Event Codes/NWR Specific Area Message Encoding (NWR-SAME) Codes|url=http://www.nws.noaa.gov/os/eas_codes.shtml|website=National Weather Service|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=October 11, 2005|access-date=August 13, 2012}}</ref>\n*'''Watch''' \u2013 A watch is used when the risk of a hazardous weather or hydrologic event has increased significantly, but its occurrence, location, or timing is still uncertain. It is intended to provide enough lead time so those who need to set their plans in motion can do so. A watch means that hazardous weather is possible. People should have a plan of action in case a storm threatens and they should listen for later information and possible warnings especially when planning travel or outdoor activities. The National Weather Service may activate weather spotters in areas affected by watches to help them better track and analyze the event.<ref>{{cite web|title=National Weather Service glossary: Watch|url=https://forecast-v3.weather.gov/glossary?search=Watch|website=National Weather Service|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=June 25, 2009|access-date=October 25, 2009}}</ref>\n*'''Warning''' \u2013 A warning is issued when a hazardous weather or hydrologic event is occurring, imminent, or likely. A warning means weather conditions pose a threat to life or property. People in the path of the storm need to take protective action.

Several common scales are described below.\n\n===Hail diameter sizes===\n{{main|Hail}}\nThe size of individual hailstones that reach surface level is determined by speed of the updraft which create the individual ice crystals at atmospheric levels. Larger hailstones are capable of producing damage to property, and particularly with very large hailstones, resulting in serious injury or death due to blunt-force trauma induced by the impact of the hailstones. Hailstone size is typically correspondent to the size of an object for comparative purposes.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| '''Hailstone size''' || '''Measurement ([[inch|in]])''' || '''Measurement ([[centimeter|cm]])''' || '''Updraft Speed (mph)''' || '''Updraft Speed (m/s)'''\n|-\n| [[pea]] || 0.25 || 0.6 || 40 || 18\n|-\n| [[penny (United States coin)|penny]] || 0.75 || 1.9 || 44 || 20\n|-\n| [[quarter (United States coin)|quarter]]* || 1.00 || 2.5 || 49 || 22\n|-\n| [[half dollar (United States coin)|half dollar]] || 1.25 || 3.2 || 54 || 24\n|-\n| [[walnut]] || 1.50 || 3.8 || 60 || 27\n|-\n| [[golf ball]] || 1.75 || 4.4 || 64 || 29\n|-\n| hen egg\u2020 || 2.00 || 5.1 || 69 || 31\n|-\n| [[tennis ball]] || 2.50 || 6.4 || 77 || 34\n|-\n| [[Baseball (ball)|baseball]] || 2.75 || 7.0 || 81 || 36\n|-\n| [[teacup|tea cup]] || 3 || 7.6 || 84 || 38\n|-\n| [[grapefruit]] || 4 || 10.1 || 98 || 44\n|-\n| [[softball]] || 4.50 || 11.4 || 103 || 46\n|-\n|}\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> <small>Begins hail sizes within the severe hail criterion.</small><br>\n\u2020 <small>Begins hail sizes within the [[Storm Prediction Center]]'s significant severe criterion.</small>\n\n===Beaufort wind scale===\n{{main|Beaufort scale}}\nThe '''Beaufort scale''' is an empirical measure that correlates wind speed to observed conditions at sea or on land.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| '''Wind category''' || '''Beaufort number''' || '''Wind speed''' || '''Conditions'''\n|-\n| [[Wind advisory|Advisory]]-force || 6 || 25\u201331&nbsp;mph<br/>(40\u201350&nbsp;km/h) || Large branches in motion; whistling in [[telephone]] wires.\n|-\n| Advisory-force || 7 || 32\u201338&nbsp;mph<br/>(51\u201362&nbsp;km/h) || Whole trees in motion; inconvenience felt walking against wind.\n|-\n| [[Gale]]-force || 8\u20139 || 39\u201354&nbsp;mph<br/>(63\u201388&nbsp;km/h) || Twigs break off trees; wind generally impedes progress.

EF0 and EF1 tornadoes are considered \"weak\" tornadoes, EF2 and EF3 are classified as \"strong\" tornadoes, with winds of at least major hurricane force, where EF4 and EF5 are categorized as \"violent\" tornadoes, with winds corresponding to category 5 hurricane winds and rising to match or exceed the strongest tropical cyclones on record. The EF scale is based on tornado damage (primarily to buildings), which makes it difficult to rate tornadoes that strike in sparsely populated areas, where few man-made structures are found. The Enhanced Fujita scale went into effect on February 1, 2007.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| EF number || Wind speed || Comparable hurricane winds || Damage || Examples \n|-\n| 0 || 65\u201385&nbsp;mph (105\u2013137&nbsp;km/h) || Severe tropical storm \u2013 Category 1 || Light damage.

The scale spans from Category 1 (winds of at least {{convert|74|mph|km/h}}) to Category 5 (exceeding {{convert|156|mph|km/h}}). Unlike the Enhanced Fujita Scale, which assigns ratings for tornadoes after damage has been incurred and thoroughly assessed, categories on the Saffir-Simpson scale are assigned to most active cyclones that reach the minimum hurricane threshold, even before landfall.\n\n<!--\nPLEASE NOTE: Intensity of example hurricanes is at time of landfall AND peak intensity. Choose your examples carefully to avoid confusion.\n\nFor instance: DO NOT ADD HURRICANE KATRINA AS AN EXAMPLE.\nKatrina is not a good example of either a Cat 3, Cat 4, or a Cat 5 since \"officially\" it was a Cat 3, it was operationally a Cat 4,\nbut in pressure, surge, and damage most people will think of it as a Cat 5, which will be confusing for the reader.\n\nDon't add any other storms with disputed categories (i.e. Ivan, Frederic).\n\nAlso, don't add linebreaks below this comment markup.\n\n-->{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\"\n|-\n!

He also had a brief loan spell in Ireland with [[Shelbourne F.C.|Shelbourne]]. In August 2010, he made a \u00a32.3m move to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] where he spent four seasons, mostly in a back-up role. Jones then had two short stints, his final in England at [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] and then in the Netherlands at [[N.E.C.

He made his professional and [[League of Ireland]] debut on 5 October against local rivals [[Bohemian F.C.|Bohemians]] at [[Dalymount Park]] and conceded 4 goals in a 6\u20134 victory one of which was direct from his own goal kick. His second appearance for the club came one week later in a 3\u20131 home victory against [[Monaghan United F.C.|Monaghan United]]. Later he had loan spells at Stockport County and Blackpool. In the [[2005\u201306 in English football|2005\u201306]] season, playing for Middlesbrough, Jones saved a [[Ruud van Nistelrooy]] penalty which left the match against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] level at 0\u20130.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/4933770.stm|title=Man Utd 0\u20130 Middlesbrough |publisher=BBC |date=1 May 2006 |accessdate=9 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2006, Jones was loaned out to Sheffield Wednesday for three months.

Jones regained his place in the Middlesbrough first team in January 2009 and remained first choice as Middlesbrough were relegated from the Premier League.

''Top row:'' king, queen, and bishop. ''Bottom row:'' knight, rook, and pawn.]]\n\nThe '''history of chess''' can be traced back nearly 1500 years, although the earliest origins are uncertain.  The earliest predecessor of the game probably originated in India, before the 6th century AD. From India, the game spread to [[Persia]]. When the Arabs conquered Persia, chess was taken up by the Muslim world and subsequently spread to Southern Europe. In Europe, chess evolved into roughly its current form in the 15th century.\n\n\"[[Romantic chess]]\" was the predominant [[chess]] playing style from the late 15th century to the 1880s.<ref name=\"Shenk, 2007\">{{cite book |author=David Shenk |title=The Immortal Game: A History of Chess |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780385510103 |url-access=registration |year=2007 |publisher=Knopf Doubleday |page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780385510103/page/99 99]}}</ref> Chess games of this period emphasised more on quick, tactical maneuvers rather than long-term strategic planning.<ref name=\"Shenk, 2007\"/> The Romantic era of play was followed by the Scientific, Hypermodern, and New Dynamism eras.<ref name=\"Shenk, 2007\"/>\nIn the second half of the 19th century, modern [[chess tournament]] play began, and the first [[World Chess Championship]] was held in 1886. The 20th century saw great leaps forward in [[chess theory]] and the establishment of the World Chess Federation ([[FIDE]]). In 1997, a [[Chess engine|computer]] first beat a chess world champion in the famous [[Deep Blue versus Garry Kasparov]] match, ushering in an era of computer domination. Since then, computer analysis \u2013 which originated in the 1970s with the first programmed chess games on the market \u2013 has contributed to much of the development in chess theory and has become an important part of preparation in professional human chess. Later developments in the 21st century made the use of [[Chess engine|computer]] analysis far surprising the ability of any human player accessible to the public, with several super-human chess engines being [[Open-source software|open source]],  raising fears of cheating in human tournaments. [[Online game|Online gaming]], which first appeared in the mid-1990s, also became popular in the 21st century.\n\n[[Chess]] remains a highly popular pastime to this day. A 2012 survey found that \"chess players now make up one of the largest communities in the world: 605 million adults play chess regularly\". Chess is played at least once a year by 12% of British people, 15% of Americans, 23% of Germans, 43% of Russians, and 70% of Indian people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fide.com/component/content/article/1-fide-news/6376-agon-releases-new-chess-player-statistics-from-yougov.html|title=AGON releases new chess player statistics from YouGov|last=AM|website=www.fide.com|access-date=2016-03-31}}</ref>\n\n== Origin ==\n{{Chaturanga diagram\n| tright\n|\n|rd|nd|bd|kd|qd|bd|nd|rd\n|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \n|pl|pl|pl|pl|pl|pl|pl|pl\n|rl|nl|bl|ql|kl|bl|nl|rl\n|''[[Chaturanga]]'' starting position.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://history.chess.free.fr//origins-structure.htm|title=The History Of Chess|publisher=ChessZone|accessdate=29 March 2011}}</ref> The kings do not face each other; the white king starts on e1 and the black king on d8.\n}}\n{{algebraic notation|pos=example}}\n\nPrecursors to chess originated in India during the [[Gupta Empire]].<ref>{{cite book\n| author=Murray, H.

These forms are represented by the pieces that would evolve into the modern pawn, knight, bishop, and rook, respectively.<ref>Murray, Davidson, Hooper & Whyld, and Golombek all give this correspondence, with the bishop corresponding to the elephant and the rook corresponding to a chariot. Bird (pp 4, 46) exchanges the bishop and rook.</ref>\n\nChess was introduced to [[Persia]] from India and became a part of the princely or courtly education of [[Persian Empire|Persian]] nobility.<ref name=Meri/>\nIn [[Sassanid Persia]] around 600 the name became ''chatrang'', which subsequently evolved to ''[[shatranj]]'', due to Arab Muslims' lack of ''ch'' and ''ng'' native sounds,<ref name=\"Shenk, David 2006\">Shenk, David. \"The Immortal Game.\" Doubleday, 2006.</ref><!--it's \u0634\u0637\u0631\u0646\u062c--> and the rules were developed further. Players started calling \"Sh\u0101h!\" (Persian for \"King!\") when attacking the opponent's king, and \"Sh\u0101h M\u0101t!\" (Persian for \"the king is helpless\" \u2013 see [[checkmate]]) when the king was attacked and could not escape from attack. These exclamations persisted in chess as it traveled to other lands.\n\nThe game was taken up by the [[Muslim world]] after the [[Islamic conquest of Persia]], with the pieces largely keeping their Persian names. The [[Moors]] of [[North Africa]] rendered Persian \"''shatranj''\" as ''sha\u1e6derej'', which gave rise to the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''acedrex'', ''axedrez'' and ''ajedrez''; in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] it became ''xadrez'', and in [[Greek language|Greek]] ''zatrikion'', but in the rest of Europe it was replaced by versions of the Persian ''sh\u0101h'' (\"king\"). Thus, the game came to be called ''ludus scacchorum'' or ''scacc(h)i'' in [[Latin]], ''scacchi'' in [[Italian language|Italian]], ''escacs'' in [[Catalan language|Catalan]], ''\u00e9checs'' in [[French language|French]] ([[Old French]] ''eschecs''); ''schaken'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], ''Schach'' in [[German language|German]], ''szachy'' in [[Polish language|Polish]], ''\u0161ahs'' in [[Latvian language|Latvian]], ''skak'' in [[Danish language|Danish]], ''sjakk'' in [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], ''schack'' in [[Swedish language|Swedish]], ''\u0161akki'' in [[Finnish language|Finnish]], ''\u0161ah'' in [[South Slavic languages]], ''sakk'' in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and ''\u015fah'' in [[Romanian language|Romanian]]; there are two theories about why this change happened:\n# From the exclamation \"check\" or \"checkmate\" as it was pronounced in various languages.\n# From the first chessmen known of in Western Europe (except [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] and Greece) being ornamental chess kings brought in as curios by Muslim traders.\n\nThe Mongols call the game ''shatar'', and in Ethiopia it is called ''senterej'', both evidently derived from ''shatranj''.\n\nChess spread directly from the [[Middle East]] to Russia, where chess became known as \u0448\u0430\u0445\u043c\u0430\u0442\u044b (''shakhmaty'', literally \"checkmates\", a [[plurale tantum]]).\n\nThe game reached Western Europe and Russia by at least three routes, the earliest being in the 9th century.

They meet in battle and Talhand dies on his elephant without a wound. Believing that Gav had killed Talhand, their mother is distraught. Gav tells his mother that Talhand did not die by the hands of him or his men, but she does not understand how this could be.

In the 13th century, shogi underwent an expansion, creating the game of [[dai shogi]], played on a 15\u00d715 board with many new pieces, including the independently invented rook, bishop and queen of modern Western chess, the drunk elephant that promotes to a second king, and also the even more powerful lion, which among other idiosyncrasies has the power to move or capture twice per turn. Around the 14th or 15th centuries, the popularity of dai shogi then waned in favour of the smaller [[chu shogi]], played on a smaller 12\u00d712 board which removed the weakest pieces from dai shogi, similarly to the development of [[Courier chess]] in the West. In the meantime, the original 9\u00d79 shogi, now termed [[sho shogi]], continued to be played, but was regarded as less prestigious than chu shogi and dai shogi. Chu shogi was very popular in Japan, and the rook, bishop, and drunk elephant from it were added to sho shogi, where the first two remain today.\n\nChu shogi declined in popularity after the addition of drops to sho shogi and the removal of the drunk elephant in the 16th century, becoming moribund around the late 20th century. These changes to sho shogi created what is essentially the modern game of shogi.\n\n=== Mongolia ===\nChess is recorded from [[Mongols|Mongolian]]-inhabited areas, where the pieces are now called:\n* '''King''': Noyon \u2013 \u041d\u043e\u0451\u043d \u2013 [[lord]]\n* '''Queen''': Bers / Nohoi \u2013 \u0411\u044d\u0440\u0441 / \u041d\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0439 \u2013 dog (to guard the livestock)\n* '''Bishop''': Tem\u0113 \u2013 \u0422\u044d\u043c\u044d\u044d \u2013 [[camel]]\n* '''Knight''': Mor\u012d \u2013 \u041c\u043e\u0440\u044c \u2013 [[horse]]\n* '''Rook''': Tereg \u2013 \u0422\u044d\u0440\u044d\u0433 \u2013 [[cart]]\n* '''Pawn''': H\u016b \u2013 \u0425\u04af\u04af \u2013 boy (the piece often showed a [[puppy]])\n\nNames recorded from the 1880s by Russian sources, quoted in Murray,<ref name=Murray/> among the [[Soyot]] people (who at the time spoke the Soyot [[Turkic language]]) include: ''merz\u00e9'' (dog), ''t\u00e4b\u00e4'' (camel), ''ot'' (horse), ''\u014dl'' (child) and Mongolian names for the other pieces. This game is called [[shatar]]; a large 10\u00d710 variant called [[hiashatar]] was also played.\n\nThe change with the queen is likely due to the Arabic word [[fers|''firz\u0101n'']] or Persian word ''farz\u012bn'' (= \"[[vizier]]\") being confused with Turkic or Mongolian native words (''merz\u00e9'' = \"mastiff\", ''bar'' or ''bars'' = \"tiger\", ''arslan'' = \"lion\").<ref name=Murray/>\n\nChess in Mongolia is now played following standard rules.\n\n=== East Siberia ===\nChess was also recorded from the [[Yakuts]], [[Evenks|Tunguses]], and [[Yukaghir]]s; but only as a children's game among the [[Chukchi people|Chukchi]]. Chessmen have been collected from the [[Tlingit people|Yakutat]] people in [[Alaska]], having no resemblance to European chessmen, and thus likely part of a chess tradition coming from [[Siberia]].<ref name=Murray/>\n\n== Arab world ==\n{{main|Shatranj}}\nChess passed from Persia to the Arab world, where its name changed to Arabic [[shatranj]]. From there it passed to Western Europe, probably via Spain.\n\nOver the centuries, features of European chess (e.g. the modern moves of queen and bishop, and castling) found their way via trade into Islamic areas. Murray's<ref name=Murray/> sources found the old moves of queen and bishop still current in [[Ethiopia]]. The game became so popular it was used in writing at that time, played by nobility and regular people. The poet al-Katib once said, \"The skilled player places his pieces in such a way as to discover consequences that the ignorant man never sees... thus, he serves the Sultan's interests, by showing how to foresee disaster.\"<ref name=\"Shenk, David 2006\"/>\n\n== Russia ==\nChess has 1000 years of history in Russia. Chess was probably brought to [[Rus' (region)|Old Russia]] in 9th century via the [[Volga trade route|Volga-Caspian]] trade route. From the 10th century cultural connections with the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the [[Vikings]] also influenced the history of chess in Russia. The vocabulary in Russian chess has various foreign-language elements and testifies to different influences in the evolution of chess in Russia. Chess is mentioned in folk poems as a popular game and is documented in the Old Russian ''[[Bylina|byliny]]''. Numerous archeological finds of the chess game have already been found in the regions of Old Russia. From 1262 on chess was called in Russia ''shakhmaty''. Various foreign travellers commented that in the 16th century, chess was popular among all classes in Russia. [[Ivan the Terrible|Ivan IV the Terrible]], who ruled Russia from 1530 to 1584, is said to have died while playing chess.<ref>Waliszewski, Kazimierz; Mary Loyd (1904). ''Ivan the Terrible''. Philadelphia: J.B. Lippincott. pp. 377\u201378.</ref> In 1791 the popular chess book ''Morals of Chess'' by [[Benjamin Franklin]] was translated into Russian and published in the country.

Retrieved 30 November 2006.</ref> [[Chess problems]] became a regular part of 19th-century newspapers; [[Bernhard Horwitz]], [[Josef Kling]] and [[Samuel Loyd]] composed some of the most influential problems. In 1843, [[Tassilo von Heydebrand und der Lasa|von der Lasa]] published his and [[Paul Rudolf von Bilguer|Bilguer's]] ''[[Handbuch des Schachspiels]]'' (''Handbook of Chess''), the first comprehensive manual of chess theory.\n\n== Modern competitive chess ==\nCompetitive chess became visible in 1834 with the [[La Bourdonnais \u2013 McDonnell chess matches|La Bourdonnais-McDonnell matches]], and the [[1851 London Chess tournament]] raised concerns about the time taken by the players to deliberate their moves. On recording time it was found that players often took hours to analyze moves, and one player took as much as two hours and 20 minutes to think over a single move at the London tournament. The following years saw the development of speed chess, five-minute chess and the most popular variant, a version allowing a bank of time to each player in which to play a previously agreed number of moves, e.g. two hours for 30 moves. In the final variant, the player who made the predetermined number of moves in the agreed time received additional time budget for his next moves. Penalties for exceeding a time limit came in form of fines and forfeiture. Since fines were easy to bear for professional players, forfeiture became the only effective penalty; this added \"lost on time\" to the traditional means of losing such as [[checkmate]] and resigning.<ref name=Britannica02b>Chess: The time element and competition (Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica 2002)</ref>\n\n[[File:1991 CPA 6284.jpg|thumb|right|[[Postage stamp|Stamp]] of the [[USSR]] devoted to the accomplished [[Estonia]]n player and analyst [[Paul Keres]], 1991]]\nIn 1861 the first time limits, using sandglasses, were employed in a tournament match at [[Bristol]], England. The sandglasses were later replaced by pendulums. Modern clocks, consisting of two parallel timers with a small button for a player to press after completing a move, were later employed to aid the players. A tiny latch called a flag further helped settle arguments over players exceeding time limit at the turn of the 19th century.<ref name=Britannica02b/>\n\nA Russian composer, Vladimir Korolkov, authored a work entitled \"Excelsior\" in 1958 in which the White side wins only by making six consecutive captures by a pawn.<ref name=Britannica02c>Chess: Chess composition (Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica 2002)</ref> Position analysis became particularly popular in the 19th century.<ref name=Britannica02c/> Many leading players were also accomplished analysts, including [[Max Euwe]], [[Mikhail Botvinnik]], [[Vasily Smyslov]] and [[Jan Timman]].<ref name=Britannica02c/> Digital clocks appeared in the 1980s.<ref name=Britannica02b/>\n\nAnother problem that arose in competitive chess was when adjourning a game for a meal break or overnight. The player who moved last before adjournment would be at a disadvantage, as the other player would have a long period to analyze before having to make a reply when the game was resumed. Preventing access to a chess set to work out moves during the adjournment would not stop him from analyzing the position in his head. Various strange ideas were attempted, but the eventual solution was the \"[[sealed move]]\". The final move before adjournment is not made on the board but instead is written on a piece of paper which the referee seals in an envelope and keeps safe. When the game is continued after adjournment, the referee makes the sealed move and the players resume.\n\n== Birth of a sport (1850\u20131945) ==\n[[File:immortal game animation.gif|right|The \"[[Immortal Game]]\", Anderssen-Kieseritzky, 1851]]\nThe first modern chess tournament was [[London 1851 chess tournament|held in London in 1851]] and won, surprisingly, by German [[Adolf Anderssen]], who was relatively unknown at the time.

The world's strongest players were seeded into \"[[Interzonal]] tournaments\", where they were joined by players who had qualified from \"Zonal tournaments\". The leading finishers in these Interzonals would go on the \"Candidates\" stage, which was initially a tournament, later a series of knock-out matches. The winner of the [[Candidates]] would then play the reigning champion for the title. A champion defeated in a match had a right to play a rematch a year later. This system worked on a three-year cycle.<ref name=\"Chess History\"/>\n\nBotvinnik participated in championship matches over a period of fifteen years. He won the world championship tournament in 1948 and retained the title in tied matches in 1951 and 1954. In 1957, he lost to [[Vasily Smyslov]], but regained the title in a rematch in 1958. In 1960, he lost the title to the [[Latvia]]n prodigy [[Mikhail Tal]], an accomplished tactician and attacking player. Botvinnik again regained the title in a rematch in 1961.\n\nFollowing the 1961 event, FIDE abolished the automatic right of a deposed champion to a rematch, and the next champion, [[Armenia]]n [[Tigran Petrosian]], a genius of defense and strong positional player, was able to hold the title for two cycles, 1963\u201369. His successor, [[Boris Spassky]] from Russia (1969\u201372), was a player able to win in both positional and sharp tactical style.<ref>Kasparov 2003b, 2004a</ref>\n\n[[File:London Chess Classic 2010 Calsen 02.jpg|thumb|right|Current World Champion [[Magnus Carlsen]] ]]\nThe next championship saw the first non-Soviet challenger since [[World War II]], [[Bobby Fischer]], who defeated his Candidates opponents by unheard-of margins and won the world championship match. In 1975, however, Fischer refused to defend his title against Soviet [[Anatoly Karpov]] when FIDE refused to meet his demands, and Karpov obtained the title by default. Karpov defended his title twice against [[Viktor Korchnoi]] and dominated the 1970s and early 1980s with a string of tournament successes.<ref>Kasparov 2003a, 2006</ref>\n\nKarpov's reign finally ended in 1985 at the hands of another Russian player, [[Garry Kasparov]].

''Top row:'' king, queen, and bishop. ''Bottom row:'' knight, rook, and pawn.]]\n\nThe '''history of chess''' can be traced back nearly 1500 years, although the earliest origins are uncertain.  The earliest predecessor of the game probably originated in India, before the 6th century AD. From India, the game spread to [[Persia]]. When the Arabs conquered Persia, chess was taken up by the Muslim world and subsequently spread to Southern Europe. In Europe, chess evolved into roughly its current form in the 15th century.\n\n\"[[Romantic chess]]\" was the predominant [[chess]] playing style from the late 15th century to the 1880s.<ref name=\"Shenk, 2007\">{{cite book |author=David Shenk |title=The Immortal Game: A History of Chess |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780385510103 |url-access=registration |year=2007 |publisher=Knopf Doubleday |page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780385510103/page/99 99]}}</ref> Chess games of this period emphasised more on quick, tactical maneuvers rather than long-term strategic planning.<ref name=\"Shenk, 2007\"/> The Romantic era of play was followed by the Scientific, Hypermodern, and New Dynamism eras.<ref name=\"Shenk, 2007\"/>\nIn the second half of the 19th century, modern [[chess tournament]] play began, and the first [[World Chess Championship]] was held in 1886. The 20th century saw great leaps forward in [[chess theory]] and the establishment of the World Chess Federation ([[FIDE]]). In 1997, a [[Chess engine|computer]] first beat a chess world champion in the famous [[Deep Blue versus Garry Kasparov]] match, ushering in an era of computer domination. Since then, computer analysis \u2013 which originated in the 1970s with the first programmed chess games on the market \u2013 has contributed to much of the development in chess theory and has become an important part of preparation in professional human chess. Later developments in the 21st century made the use of [[Chess engine|computer]] analysis far surprising the ability of any human player accessible to the public, with several super-human chess engines being [[Open-source software|open source]],  raising fears of cheating in human tournaments. [[Online game|Online gaming]], which first appeared in the mid-1990s, also became popular in the 21st century.\n\n[[Chess]] remains a highly popular pastime to this day. A 2012 survey found that \"chess players now make up one of the largest communities in the world: 605 million adults play chess regularly\". Chess is played at least once a year by 12% of British people, 15% of Americans, 23% of Germans, 43% of Russians, and 70% of Indian people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fide.com/component/content/article/1-fide-news/6376-agon-releases-new-chess-player-statistics-from-yougov.html|title=AGON releases new chess player statistics from YouGov|last=AM|website=www.fide.com|access-date=2016-03-31}}</ref>\n\n== Origin ==\n{{Chaturanga diagram\n| tright\n|\n|rd|nd|bd|kd|qd|bd|nd|rd\n|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd|pd\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  | \n|pl|pl|pl|pl|pl|pl|pl|pl\n|rl|nl|bl|ql|kl|bl|nl|rl\n|''[[Chaturanga]]'' starting position.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://history.chess.free.fr//origins-structure.htm|title=The History Of Chess|publisher=ChessZone|accessdate=29 March 2011}}</ref> The kings do not face each other; the white king starts on e1 and the black king on d8.\n}}\n{{algebraic notation|pos=example}}\n\nPrecursors to chess originated in India during the [[Gupta Empire]].<ref>{{cite book\n| author=Murray, H.

These forms are represented by the pieces that would evolve into the modern pawn, knight, bishop, and rook, respectively.<ref>Murray, Davidson, Hooper & Whyld, and Golombek all give this correspondence, with the bishop corresponding to the elephant and the rook corresponding to a chariot. Bird (pp 4, 46) exchanges the bishop and rook.</ref>\n\nChess was introduced to [[Persia]] from India and became a part of the princely or courtly education of [[Persian Empire|Persian]] nobility.<ref name=Meri/>\nIn [[Sassanid Persia]] around 600 the name became ''chatrang'', which subsequently evolved to ''[[shatranj]]'', due to Arab Muslims' lack of ''ch'' and ''ng'' native sounds,<ref name=\"Shenk, David 2006\">Shenk, David. \"The Immortal Game.\" Doubleday, 2006.</ref><!--it's \u0634\u0637\u0631\u0646\u062c--> and the rules were developed further. Players started calling \"Sh\u0101h!\" (Persian for \"King!\") when attacking the opponent's king, and \"Sh\u0101h M\u0101t!\" (Persian for \"the king is helpless\" \u2013 see [[checkmate]]) when the king was attacked and could not escape from attack. These exclamations persisted in chess as it traveled to other lands.\n\nThe game was taken up by the [[Muslim world]] after the [[Islamic conquest of Persia]], with the pieces largely keeping their Persian names. The [[Moors]] of [[North Africa]] rendered Persian \"''shatranj''\" as ''sha\u1e6derej'', which gave rise to the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''acedrex'', ''axedrez'' and ''ajedrez''; in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] it became ''xadrez'', and in [[Greek language|Greek]] ''zatrikion'', but in the rest of Europe it was replaced by versions of the Persian ''sh\u0101h'' (\"king\"). Thus, the game came to be called ''ludus scacchorum'' or ''scacc(h)i'' in [[Latin]], ''scacchi'' in [[Italian language|Italian]], ''escacs'' in [[Catalan language|Catalan]], ''\u00e9checs'' in [[French language|French]] ([[Old French]] ''eschecs''); ''schaken'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], ''Schach'' in [[German language|German]], ''szachy'' in [[Polish language|Polish]], ''\u0161ahs'' in [[Latvian language|Latvian]], ''skak'' in [[Danish language|Danish]], ''sjakk'' in [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], ''schack'' in [[Swedish language|Swedish]], ''\u0161akki'' in [[Finnish language|Finnish]], ''\u0161ah'' in [[South Slavic languages]], ''sakk'' in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and ''\u015fah'' in [[Romanian language|Romanian]]; there are two theories about why this change happened:\n# From the exclamation \"check\" or \"checkmate\" as it was pronounced in various languages.\n# From the first chessmen known of in Western Europe (except [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] and Greece) being ornamental chess kings brought in as curios by Muslim traders.\n\nThe Mongols call the game ''shatar'', and in Ethiopia it is called ''senterej'', both evidently derived from ''shatranj''.\n\nChess spread directly from the [[Middle East]] to Russia, where chess became known as \u0448\u0430\u0445\u043c\u0430\u0442\u044b (''shakhmaty'', literally \"checkmates\", a [[plurale tantum]]).\n\nThe game reached Western Europe and Russia by at least three routes, the earliest being in the 9th century.

They meet in battle and Talhand dies on his elephant without a wound. Believing that Gav had killed Talhand, their mother is distraught. Gav tells his mother that Talhand did not die by the hands of him or his men, but she does not understand how this could be.

In the 13th century, shogi underwent an expansion, creating the game of [[dai shogi]], played on a 15\u00d715 board with many new pieces, including the independently invented rook, bishop and queen of modern Western chess, the drunk elephant that promotes to a second king, and also the even more powerful lion, which among other idiosyncrasies has the power to move or capture twice per turn. Around the 14th or 15th centuries, the popularity of dai shogi then waned in favour of the smaller [[chu shogi]], played on a smaller 12\u00d712 board which removed the weakest pieces from dai shogi, similarly to the development of [[Courier chess]] in the West. In the meantime, the original 9\u00d79 shogi, now termed [[sho shogi]], continued to be played, but was regarded as less prestigious than chu shogi and dai shogi. Chu shogi was very popular in Japan, and the rook, bishop, and drunk elephant from it were added to sho shogi, where the first two remain today.\n\nChu shogi declined in popularity after the addition of drops to sho shogi and the removal of the drunk elephant in the 16th century, becoming moribund around the late 20th century. These changes to sho shogi created what is essentially the modern game of shogi.\n\n=== Mongolia ===\nChess is recorded from [[Mongols|Mongolian]]-inhabited areas, where the pieces are now called:\n* '''King''': Noyon \u2013 \u041d\u043e\u0451\u043d \u2013 [[lord]]\n* '''Queen''': Bers / Nohoi \u2013 \u0411\u044d\u0440\u0441 / \u041d\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0439 \u2013 dog (to guard the livestock)\n* '''Bishop''': Tem\u0113 \u2013 \u0422\u044d\u043c\u044d\u044d \u2013 [[camel]]\n* '''Knight''': Mor\u012d \u2013 \u041c\u043e\u0440\u044c \u2013 [[horse]]\n* '''Rook''': Tereg \u2013 \u0422\u044d\u0440\u044d\u0433 \u2013 [[cart]]\n* '''Pawn''': H\u016b \u2013 \u0425\u04af\u04af \u2013 boy (the piece often showed a [[puppy]])\n\nNames recorded from the 1880s by Russian sources, quoted in Murray,<ref name=Murray/> among the [[Soyot]] people (who at the time spoke the Soyot [[Turkic language]]) include: ''merz\u00e9'' (dog), ''t\u00e4b\u00e4'' (camel), ''ot'' (horse), ''\u014dl'' (child) and Mongolian names for the other pieces. This game is called [[shatar]]; a large 10\u00d710 variant called [[hiashatar]] was also played.\n\nThe change with the queen is likely due to the Arabic word [[fers|''firz\u0101n'']] or Persian word ''farz\u012bn'' (= \"[[vizier]]\") being confused with Turkic or Mongolian native words (''merz\u00e9'' = \"mastiff\", ''bar'' or ''bars'' = \"tiger\", ''arslan'' = \"lion\").<ref name=Murray/>\n\nChess in Mongolia is now played following standard rules.\n\n=== East Siberia ===\nChess was also recorded from the [[Yakuts]], [[Evenks|Tunguses]], and [[Yukaghir]]s; but only as a children's game among the [[Chukchi people|Chukchi]]. Chessmen have been collected from the [[Tlingit people|Yakutat]] people in [[Alaska]], having no resemblance to European chessmen, and thus likely part of a chess tradition coming from [[Siberia]].<ref name=Murray/>\n\n== Arab world ==\n{{main|Shatranj}}\nChess passed from Persia to the Arab world, where its name changed to Arabic [[shatranj]]. From there it passed to Western Europe, probably via Spain.\n\nOver the centuries, features of European chess (e.g. the modern moves of queen and bishop, and castling) found their way via trade into Islamic areas. Murray's<ref name=Murray/> sources found the old moves of queen and bishop still current in [[Ethiopia]]. The game became so popular it was used in writing at that time, played by nobility and regular people. The poet al-Katib once said, \"The skilled player places his pieces in such a way as to discover consequences that the ignorant man never sees... thus, he serves the Sultan's interests, by showing how to foresee disaster.\"<ref name=\"Shenk, David 2006\"/>\n\n== Russia ==\nChess has 1000 years of history in Russia. Chess was probably brought to [[Rus' (region)|Old Russia]] in 9th century via the [[Volga trade route|Volga-Caspian]] trade route. From the 10th century cultural connections with the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the [[Vikings]] also influenced the history of chess in Russia. The vocabulary in Russian chess has various foreign-language elements and testifies to different influences in the evolution of chess in Russia. Chess is mentioned in folk poems as a popular game and is documented in the Old Russian ''[[Bylina|byliny]]''. Numerous archeological finds of the chess game have already been found in the regions of Old Russia. From 1262 on chess was called in Russia ''shakhmaty''. Various foreign travellers commented that in the 16th century, chess was popular among all classes in Russia. [[Ivan the Terrible|Ivan IV the Terrible]], who ruled Russia from 1530 to 1584, is said to have died while playing chess.<ref>Waliszewski, Kazimierz; Mary Loyd (1904). ''Ivan the Terrible''.

Retrieved 30 November 2006.</ref> [[Chess problems]] became a regular part of 19th-century newspapers; [[Bernhard Horwitz]], [[Josef Kling]] and [[Samuel Loyd]] composed some of the most influential problems. In 1843, [[Tassilo von Heydebrand und der Lasa|von der Lasa]] published his and [[Paul Rudolf von Bilguer|Bilguer's]] ''[[Handbuch des Schachspiels]]'' (''Handbook of Chess''), the first comprehensive manual of chess theory.\n\n== Modern competitive chess ==\nCompetitive chess became visible in 1834 with the [[La Bourdonnais \u2013 McDonnell chess matches|La Bourdonnais-McDonnell matches]], and the [[1851 London Chess tournament]] raised concerns about the time taken by the players to deliberate their moves. On recording time it was found that players often took hours to analyze moves, and one player took as much as two hours and 20 minutes to think over a single move at the London tournament. The following years saw the development of speed chess, five-minute chess and the most popular variant, a version allowing a bank of time to each player in which to play a previously agreed number of moves, e.g. two hours for 30 moves. In the final variant, the player who made the predetermined number of moves in the agreed time received additional time budget for his next moves. Penalties for exceeding a time limit came in form of fines and forfeiture. Since fines were easy to bear for professional players, forfeiture became the only effective penalty; this added \"lost on time\" to the traditional means of losing such as [[checkmate]] and resigning.<ref name=Britannica02b>Chess: The time element and competition (Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica 2002)</ref>\n\n[[File:1991 CPA 6284.jpg|thumb|right|[[Postage stamp|Stamp]] of the [[USSR]] devoted to the accomplished [[Estonia]]n player and analyst [[Paul Keres]], 1991]]\nIn 1861 the first time limits, using sandglasses, were employed in a tournament match at [[Bristol]], England. The sandglasses were later replaced by pendulums. Modern clocks, consisting of two parallel timers with a small button for a player to press after completing a move, were later employed to aid the players. A tiny latch called a flag further helped settle arguments over players exceeding time limit at the turn of the 19th century.<ref name=Britannica02b/>\n\nA Russian composer, Vladimir Korolkov, authored a work entitled \"Excelsior\" in 1958 in which the White side wins only by making six consecutive captures by a pawn.<ref name=Britannica02c>Chess: Chess composition (Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica 2002)</ref> Position analysis became particularly popular in the 19th century.<ref name=Britannica02c/> Many leading players were also accomplished analysts, including [[Max Euwe]], [[Mikhail Botvinnik]], [[Vasily Smyslov]] and [[Jan Timman]].<ref name=Britannica02c/> Digital clocks appeared in the 1980s.<ref name=Britannica02b/>\n\nAnother problem that arose in competitive chess was when adjourning a game for a meal break or overnight. The player who moved last before adjournment would be at a disadvantage, as the other player would have a long period to analyze before having to make a reply when the game was resumed. Preventing access to a chess set to work out moves during the adjournment would not stop him from analyzing the position in his head. Various strange ideas were attempted, but the eventual solution was the \"[[sealed move]]\". The final move before adjournment is not made on the board but instead is written on a piece of paper which the referee seals in an envelope and keeps safe. When the game is continued after adjournment, the referee makes the sealed move and the players resume.\n\n== Birth of a sport (1850\u20131945) ==\n[[File:immortal game animation.gif|right|The \"[[Immortal Game]]\", Anderssen-Kieseritzky, 1851]]\nThe first modern chess tournament was [[London 1851 chess tournament|held in London in 1851]] and won, surprisingly, by German [[Adolf Anderssen]], who was relatively unknown at the time.

The world's strongest players were seeded into \"[[Interzonal]] tournaments\", where they were joined by players who had qualified from \"Zonal tournaments\". The leading finishers in these Interzonals would go on the \"Candidates\" stage, which was initially a tournament, later a series of knock-out matches. The winner of the [[Candidates]] would then play the reigning champion for the title. A champion defeated in a match had a right to play a rematch a year later. This system worked on a three-year cycle.<ref name=\"Chess History\"/>\n\nBotvinnik participated in championship matches over a period of fifteen years. He won the world championship tournament in 1948 and retained the title in tied matches in 1951 and 1954. In 1957, he lost to [[Vasily Smyslov]], but regained the title in a rematch in 1958. In 1960, he lost the title to the [[Latvia]]n prodigy [[Mikhail Tal]], an accomplished tactician and attacking player. Botvinnik again regained the title in a rematch in 1961.\n\nFollowing the 1961 event, FIDE abolished the automatic right of a deposed champion to a rematch, and the next champion, [[Armenia]]n [[Tigran Petrosian]], a genius of defense and strong positional player, was able to hold the title for two cycles, 1963\u201369. His successor, [[Boris Spassky]] from Russia (1969\u201372), was a player able to win in both positional and sharp tactical style.<ref>Kasparov 2003b, 2004a</ref>\n\n[[File:London Chess Classic 2010 Calsen 02.jpg|thumb|right|Current World Champion [[Magnus Carlsen]] ]]\nThe next championship saw the first non-Soviet challenger since [[World War II]], [[Bobby Fischer]], who defeated his Candidates opponents by unheard-of margins and won the world championship match. In 1975, however, Fischer refused to defend his title against Soviet [[Anatoly Karpov]] when FIDE refused to meet his demands, and Karpov obtained the title by default. Karpov defended his title twice against [[Viktor Korchnoi]] and dominated the 1970s and early 1980s with a string of tournament successes.<ref>Kasparov 2003a, 2006</ref>\n\nKarpov's reign finally ended in 1985 at the hands of another Russian player, [[Garry Kasparov]].

From then until 2006, there were two simultaneous World Champions and World Championships: the PCA or Classical champion extending the Steinitzian tradition in which the current champion plays a challenger in a series of many games; the other following FIDE's new format of many players competing in a tournament to determine the champion. Kasparov lost his Classical title in 2000 to [[Vladimir Kramnik]] of Russia.\n\nEarlier in 1999, Kasparov as the reigning world champion played a [[Kasparov versus the World|game online against the world team]] composed of more than 50,000 participants from more than 75 countries. The moves of the world team were decided by plurality vote, and after 62 moves played over four months Kasparov won the game.<ref name=\"harding\">Harding, T. (2002).

Publicity (e.g. by chess problem setters) showed that the old wording of two rules allowed unintended types of moves:\n* The promotion rule was found to say that a pawn is to be promoted to \"a piece\" of unspecified colour, thus including an enemy piece (thus on occasion blocking the enemy king in, or preventing stalemate by giving the opponent something to move).\n* The castling rule was found to allow (White) Ke1\u2013e3 and Re8\u2013e2, and (Black) Ke8\u2013e6 and Re1\u2013e7, if \"the rook had not been moved\" as a rook because it had been a pawn [[underpromotion|underpromoted]] on e8/e1.\nThe wording of both rules was changed to forbid the unintended allowed moves.\n\n{{further|Joke chess problem#Offbeat interpretations of the rules of chess|l1=Offbeat interpretations of the rules of chess}}\n\nIn recent times, more ways to lose have been brought in:\n* The [[1851 London Chess tournament]] showed the need for time control, resulting in ability to \"lose on time\".\n* If a [[mobile phone]] or other electrical device generates sound, the player thereby loses; but if the other player cannot win by any possible sequence of legal moves, the result is a draw.<ref name=\"FIDE\">{{cite web|title=FIDE LAWS of CHESS - Article 12: The conduct of the players|url=http://www.fide.com/FIDE/handbook/LawsOfChess.pdf|website=www.fide.com/|publisher=World Chess Federation|accessdate=July 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Invention of chess (story)]]\n* [[List of chess historians]]\n* [[List of chess variants]]\n* [[List of games that Buddha would not play]]\n* {{sectionlink|Outline of chess|History of chess}}\n* [[School of chess]]\n* [[Timeline of chess]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n'''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'''\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica | year = 2002 | title = Chess: Ancient precursors and related games. | publisher = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica }}\n* {{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica | year = 2002 | title = Chess: Development of Theory | publisher = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica }}\n* {{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica | year = 2002 | title = Chess: The time element and competition | publisher = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}\n* {{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica | year = 2002 | title = Chess: Chess composition | publisher = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica }}\n* {{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica | year = 2002 | title = Chess (History): Standardization of rules | publisher = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica }}\n* {{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica | year = 2007 | title = Chess: Set design. | publisher = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica | url = http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-80432/chess | accessdate = 2007-10-28 }}\n* {{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica | year = 2007 | title = Chess: Introduction to Europe | publisher = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica | url = http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-80430/chess | accessdate = 2007-10-28 }}\n* {{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica | year = 2007 | title = Chinese chess | publisher = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica | url = http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9024151 | accessdate = 2007-10-28 }}\n* {{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica | year = 2002 | title = Shogi | publisher = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica }}\n{{refend}}\n\n'''WWW'''\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite web| last = Banaschak| first = Peter | title = A story well told is not necessarily true : a critical assessment of David H.

Henare went on to win Te Tai Tokerau after the switch to MMP, and New Zealand First won all five of the newly-drawn M\u0101ori electorates.\n\nAfter a tumultuous [[45th New Zealand Parliament|parliamentary term]] which saw all but one of the five New Zealand First M\u0101ori MPs defect to other parties, (including Henare himself, who went on to found [[Mauri Pacific]]), Labour won all six M\u0101ori electorates contested at the [[1999 New Zealand general election|1999 election]]. In Te Tai Tokerau, Tau Henare was beaten into third place behind the New Zealand First candidate and [[Dover Samuels]], who Henare had beaten three years previous.\n\nHowever, Labour's losing the five M\u0101ori electorates in 1996 showed that the M\u0101ori vote was contestable for the first time in five decades, as the new electoral system coupled with the rise of small parties meant that non-Labour candidacy in these seats was more feasible than under [[First Past the Post]].\n\nThe [[New Zealand foreshore and seabed controversy]] of 2004\u201305 proved to be the catalyst for the second challenge to Labour party domination of the M\u0101ori electorates, this time from the [[M\u0101ori Party]].

Henare went on to win Te Tai Tokerau after the switch to MMP, and New Zealand First won all five of the newly-drawn M\u0101ori electorates.\n\nAfter a tumultuous [[45th New Zealand Parliament|parliamentary term]] which saw all but one of the five New Zealand First M\u0101ori MPs defect to other parties, (including Henare himself, who went on to found [[Mauri Pacific]]), Labour won all six M\u0101ori electorates contested at the [[1999 New Zealand general election|1999 election]]. In Te Tai Tokerau, Tau Henare was beaten into third place behind the New Zealand First candidate and [[Dover Samuels]], who Henare had beaten three years previous.\n\nHowever, Labour's losing the five M\u0101ori electorates in 1996 showed that the M\u0101ori vote was contestable for the first time in five decades, as the new electoral system coupled with the rise of small parties meant that non-Labour candidacy in these seats was more feasible than under [[First Past the Post]].\n\nThe [[New Zealand foreshore and seabed controversy]] of 2004\u201305 proved to be the catalyst for the second challenge to Labour party domination of the M\u0101ori electorates, this time from the [[M\u0101ori Party]]. At the [[2005 New Zealand general election|2005 election]], Samuels and three other Labour M\u0101ori MPs lost their seats to M\u0101ori Party challengers. In Te Tai Tokerau, the winner was [[Hone Harawira]].<ref name=\"Harawira parliamentary bio\">{{cite web|title=Hone Harawira |url= http://www.parliament.nz/en-NZ/MPP/MPs/MPs/0/f/a/50MP126921-Harawira-Hone.htm |publisher=New Zealand Parliament |accessdate=3 December 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"Te Tai Tokerau 2005 election\">{{cite web |title=Official Count Results \u2013 Te Tai Tokerau|url= http://www.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2005/electorate-67.html |publisher=Chief Electoral Office, Wellington |accessdate=3 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nHarawira resigned from the M\u0101ori Party in early 2011 and became an independent MP.

It is the peacetime equivalent of the [[Param Vir Chakra]] (PVC), and is awarded for the \"most conspicuous bravery or some daring or pre-eminent valour or self-sacrifice\" other than in the face of the enemy. The decoration may be awarded either to military or civilian personnel.\n\nFlt. Lt. [[Suhas Biswas]] was the first [[Indian Air Force]] officer to be awarded the Ashoka Chakra<!--wasn't he the first person of any description?  why single out the air force?-->. Subsequent awards of the Ashoka Chakra are recognized by a bar to the medal ribbon. A recipient can be awarded the [[Kirti Chakra]] or [[Shaurya Chakra]] in addition for separate acts of gallantry.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe medal was originally established on 4 January 1952 as the \"Ashoka Chakra, Class I\" as the first step of a three-class sequence of non-combatant bravery decorations. In 1967, these decorations were removed from the \"class-based\" system and renamed as the Ashoka Chakra, Kirti Chakra, and Shaurya Chakra. This is an important point in understanding the independent Indian view of decorations. It would also lead to changes in the Padma Vibhushan series, the distinguished service medal series, the life saving medal series, and the Defence Security Corps medal series.\n\nFrom 1 February 1999, the central government instituted a monthly stipend for Ashoka Chakra recipients of Rs. 1400. Jammu and Kashmir awarded a cash award of Rs. 1500 for recipients of this award.\n\n== Overview ==\n\n'''Obverse:''' Circular gold gilt, 1-3/8&nbsp;inches in diameter.

It is the peacetime equivalent of the [[Param Vir Chakra]] (PVC), and is awarded for the \"most conspicuous bravery or some daring or pre-eminent valour or self-sacrifice\" other than in the face of the enemy. The decoration may be awarded either to military or civilian personnel.\n\nFlt. Lt. [[Suhas Biswas]] was the first [[Indian Air Force]] officer to be awarded the Ashoka Chakra<!--wasn't he the first person of any description?  why single out the air force?-->. Subsequent awards of the Ashoka Chakra are recognized by a bar to the medal ribbon. A recipient can be awarded the [[Kirti Chakra]] or [[Shaurya Chakra]] in addition for separate acts of gallantry.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe medal was originally established on 4 January 1952 as the \"Ashoka Chakra, Class I\" as the first step of a three-class sequence of non-combatant bravery decorations. In 1967, these decorations were removed from the \"class-based\" system and renamed as the Ashoka Chakra, Kirti Chakra, and Shaurya Chakra. This is an important point in understanding the independent Indian view of decorations. It would also lead to changes in the Padma Vibhushan series, the distinguished service medal series, the life saving medal series, and the Defence Security Corps medal series.\n\nFrom 1 February 1999, the central government instituted a monthly stipend for Ashoka Chakra recipients of Rs. 1400. Jammu and Kashmir awarded a cash award of Rs. 1500 for recipients of this award.\n\n== Overview ==\n\n'''Obverse:''' Circular gold gilt, 1-3/8&nbsp;inches in diameter. In the center, the chakra (wheel) of Ashoka, surrounded by a lotus wreath and with an ornate edge. Suspended by a straight bar suspender.

A 2013 review recommends that only in the very rare instances where a shark clearly predated on a human should the bite incident be termed an \"attack,\" which implies predation, and that otherwise it is more accurate to class bite incidents as \"sighting\", \"encounter\", \"bite incident\", or \"fatal bite incident\". Sightings do not include physical interaction, encounters include physical interaction without harm, shark bites include minor and major shark bite incidents, including those that do and do not require medical attention, and fatal shark bite incidents are those that result in death. The study suggests that only in a case where an expert validates the predatory intent of a shark would it be appropriate to term a bite incident an attack.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Neff|first=Christopher|last2=Hueter|first2=Robert|date=23 January 2013|title=Science, policy, and the public discourse of shark \"attack\": a proposal for reclassifying human\u2013shark interactions|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235930824|journal=Journal of Environmental Studies and Sciences|language=en|volume=3|issue=1|pages=65\u201373|doi=10.1007/s13412-013-0107-2|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n== Statistics ==\n[[File:Total shark attacks per year, OWID.svg|thumb|upright=2|Total shark attacks per year, 1749 to 2018<ref>{{cite web |title=Total shark attacks per year |url=https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/total-shark-attacks-per-year |website=Our World in Data}}</ref>]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:auto; float:right; clear:right; margin:0 0 0.5em 1em; text-align:right; font-size: 85%;\"\n|-\n|+ style=\"background:#66a; color:#fff;\" colspan=\"4\"| Confirmed unprovoked shark attacks, 1958\u20132018\n|-\n!

The increased use of technology has enabled Australia and the United States to record more data than other nations, which could somewhat bias the results recorded. In addition to this, individuals and institutions in South Africa, the US and Australia keep a file which is regularly updated by an entire research team, the International Shark Attack File, and the Australian Shark Attack File.\n\nThe [[Florida Museum of Natural History]] compares these statistics with the much higher rate of deaths from other causes. For example, an average of more than 38 people die annually from [[lightning]] strikes in coastal states, while less than 1 person per year is killed by a shark in Florida.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/sharks/attacks/relarisk.htm |title=The Relative Risk of Shark Attacks to Humans |publisher=Flmnh.ufl.edu |accessdate=23 September 2010}}</ref><ref>Florida Museum of Natural History, University of Florida.

For example, in the southwest of [[West Australia]] the chances of a surfer suffering a fatal shark bite in winter or spring are 1 in 40,000 and for divers it is 1 in 16,000.<ref name=\"Spri\" /><ref name=\"whalemig\" /> In comparison to the risk of a serious or fatal cycling accident, this represents 3 times the risk for a surfer and 7 times the risk for a diver.<ref name=\"Spri\" />\n\n== Species involved in incidents ==\n[[File:Snorkeler with blacktip reef shark.jpg|thumb|300px|left|A [[blacktip reef shark]].

It is possible that the sharks are able to sense the presence of unnatural elements on or about the divers, such as polyurethane diving suits and air tanks, which may lead them to accept temporary outsiders as more of a curiosity than prey. Uncostumed humans, however, such as those surfboarding, light snorkeling or swimming, present a much greater area of exposed skin surface to sharks. In addition, the presence of even small traces of blood, recent minor abrasions, cuts, scrapes or bruises, may lead sharks to attack a human in their environment. Sharks seek out prey through [[electroreception]], sensing the electric fields that are generated by all animals due to the activity of their nerves and muscles.\n\nMost of the oceanic whitetip shark's attacks have not been recorded,<ref name=\"howstuffdangerous4\"/> unlike the other three species mentioned above. Famed oceanographic researcher [[Jacques Cousteau]] described the oceanic whitetip as \"the most dangerous of all sharks\".<ref>{{cite book|author1=Cousteau, Jacques-Yves  |author2=Cousteau, Philippe |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Shark: Splendid Savage of the Sea|publisher= Doubleday & Company, Inc|year=1970}}</ref> [[File:Watsonandtheshark-original.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Watson and the Shark]]'' by [[John Singleton Copley|J.S. Copley]], based on the attack on [[Brook Watson]] in [[Havana Harbor]] in 1749]]Modern-day statistics show the oceanic whitetip shark as seldom being involved in unprovoked attacks. However, there have been a number of attacks involving this species, particularly during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. The oceanic whitetip lives in the open sea and rarely shows up near coasts, where most recorded incidents occur. During the world wars, many ship and aircraft disasters happened in the open ocean, and because of its former abundance, the oceanic whitetip was often the first species on site when such a disaster happened.\n\nInfamous examples of oceanic whitetip attacks include the sinking of the [[RMS Nova Scotia (1926)|''Nova Scotia'']], a British steamship carrying 1,000 people that was torpedoed by a [[German submarine]] on 18 November 1942, near [[South Africa]]. Only 192 people survived, with many deaths attributed to the oceanic whitetip shark.<ref>Bass, A.J., J.D. D'Aubrey & N. Kistnasamy. 1973. \"Sharks of the east coast of southern Africa. 1.

This group includes the [[shortfin mako shark|shortfin mako]], [[hammerhead shark|hammerhead]], [[Galapagos shark|Galapagos]], [[gray reef shark|gray reef]], [[blacktip shark|blacktip]], [[lemon shark|lemon]], [[silky shark]] and [[blue shark|blue]] sharks.<ref name=\"isaf\"/> These sharks are also large, powerful predators which can be provoked simply by being in the water at the wrong time and place, but they are normally considered less dangerous to humans than the previous group.\n\nOn the evening of 16 March 2009, a new addition was made to the list of sharks known to have attacked human beings.

Incidents that occur outside of a shark's natural habitat, such as aquariums and research holding-pens, are considered provoked, as are all incidents involving captured sharks. Sometimes humans inadvertently provoke an attack, such as when a surfer accidentally hits a shark with a surf board.\n\n=== Unprovoked attack ===\nUnprovoked attacks are initiated by the shark\u2014they occur in a shark's natural habitat on a live human and without human provocation.<ref name=\"ISAF-2011Summary\"/><ref name=\"GSAF-IL\"/> There are three subcategories of unprovoked attack:\n* Hit-and-run attack \u2013 usually non-fatal, the shark bites and then leaves; most victims do not see the shark. This is the most common type of attack and typically occurs in the surf zone or in murky water. Most hit-and-run attacks are believed to be the result of mistaken identity.<ref name=\"ISAF-HWW\">{{cite web |url=http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/sharks/attacks/howwhen.htm |title=How, When, & Where Sharks Attack |author=Burgess, George H. |authorlink=George H. Burgess |publisher=International Shark Attack File |accessdate=26 June 2012}}</ref>\n* Sneak attack \u2013 the victim will not usually see the shark, and may sustain multiple deep bites. This kind of attack is predatory in nature and is often carried out with the intention of consuming the victim. It is extraordinarily rare for this to occur.\n* Bump-and-bite attack \u2013 the shark circles and bumps the victim before biting. Great whites are known to do this on occasion, referred to as a \"test bite\", in which the great white is attempting to identify what is being bitten. Repeated bites, depending on the reaction of the victim (thrashing or panicking may lead the shark to believe the victim is prey), are not uncommon and can be severe or fatal. Bump-and-bite attacks are not believed to be the result of mistaken identity.<ref name=\"ISAF-HWW\"/>\n\nAn incident occurred in 2011 when a 3-meter long great white shark jumped onto a 7-person [[research vessel]] off [[Seal Island, South Africa]].

A 2013 review recommends that only in the very rare instances where a shark clearly predated on a human should the bite incident be termed an \"attack,\" which implies predation, and that otherwise it is more accurate to class bite incidents as \"sighting\", \"encounter\", \"bite incident\", or \"fatal bite incident\". Sightings do not include physical interaction, encounters include physical interaction without harm, shark bites include minor and major shark bite incidents, including those that do and do not require medical attention, and fatal shark bite incidents are those that result in death. The study suggests that only in a case where an expert validates the predatory intent of a shark would it be appropriate to term a bite incident an attack.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Neff|first=Christopher|last2=Hueter|first2=Robert|date=23 January 2013|title=Science, policy, and the public discourse of shark \"attack\": a proposal for reclassifying human\u2013shark interactions|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235930824|journal=Journal of Environmental Studies and Sciences|language=en|volume=3|issue=1|pages=65\u201373|doi=10.1007/s13412-013-0107-2|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n== Statistics ==\n[[File:Total shark attacks per year, OWID.svg|thumb|upright=2|Total shark attacks per year, 1749 to 2018<ref>{{cite web |title=Total shark attacks per year |url=https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/total-shark-attacks-per-year |website=Our World in Data}}</ref>]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:auto; float:right; clear:right; margin:0 0 0.5em 1em; text-align:right; font-size: 85%;\"\n|-\n|+ style=\"background:#66a; color:#fff;\" colspan=\"4\"| Confirmed unprovoked shark attacks, 1958\u20132018\n|-\n!

The increased use of technology has enabled Australia and the United States to record more data than other nations, which could somewhat bias the results recorded. In addition to this, individuals and institutions in South Africa, the US and Australia keep a file which is regularly updated by an entire research team, the International Shark Attack File, and the Australian Shark Attack File.\n\nThe [[Florida Museum of Natural History]] compares these statistics with the much higher rate of deaths from other causes. For example, an average of more than 38 people die annually from [[lightning]] strikes in coastal states, while less than 1 person per year is killed by a shark in Florida.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/sharks/attacks/relarisk.htm |title=The Relative Risk of Shark Attacks to Humans |publisher=Flmnh.ufl.edu |accessdate=23 September 2010}}</ref><ref>Florida Museum of Natural History, University of Florida.

It is possible that the sharks are able to sense the presence of unnatural elements on or about the divers, such as polyurethane diving suits and air tanks, which may lead them to accept temporary outsiders as more of a curiosity than prey. Uncostumed humans, however, such as those surfboarding, light snorkeling or swimming, present a much greater area of exposed skin surface to sharks. In addition, the presence of even small traces of blood, recent minor abrasions, cuts, scrapes or bruises, may lead sharks to attack a human in their environment. Sharks seek out prey through [[electroreception]], sensing the electric fields that are generated by all animals due to the activity of their nerves and muscles.\n\nMost of the oceanic whitetip shark's attacks have not been recorded,<ref name=\"howstuffdangerous4\"/> unlike the other three species mentioned above. Famed oceanographic researcher [[Jacques Cousteau]] described the oceanic whitetip as \"the most dangerous of all sharks\".<ref>{{cite book|author1=Cousteau, Jacques-Yves  |author2=Cousteau, Philippe |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Shark: Splendid Savage of the Sea|publisher= Doubleday & Company, Inc|year=1970}}</ref> [[File:Watsonandtheshark-original.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Watson and the Shark]]'' by [[John Singleton Copley|J.S. Copley]], based on the attack on [[Brook Watson]] in [[Havana Harbor]] in 1749]]Modern-day statistics show the oceanic whitetip shark as seldom being involved in unprovoked attacks. However, there have been a number of attacks involving this species, particularly during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. The oceanic whitetip lives in the open sea and rarely shows up near coasts, where most recorded incidents occur. During the world wars, many ship and aircraft disasters happened in the open ocean, and because of its former abundance, the oceanic whitetip was often the first species on site when such a disaster happened.\n\nInfamous examples of oceanic whitetip attacks include the sinking of the [[RMS Nova Scotia (1926)|''Nova Scotia'']], a British steamship carrying 1,000 people that was torpedoed by a [[German submarine]] on 18 November 1942, near [[South Africa]]. Only 192 people survived, with many deaths attributed to the oceanic whitetip shark.<ref>Bass, A.J., J.D. D'Aubrey & N. Kistnasamy. 1973. \"Sharks of the east coast of southern Africa. 1.

Incidents that occur outside of a shark's natural habitat, such as aquariums and research holding-pens, are considered provoked, as are all incidents involving captured sharks. Sometimes humans inadvertently provoke an attack, such as when a surfer accidentally hits a shark with a surf board.\n\n=== Unprovoked attack ===\nUnprovoked attacks are initiated by the shark\u2014they occur in a shark's natural habitat on a live human and without human provocation.<ref name=\"ISAF-2011Summary\"/><ref name=\"GSAF-IL\"/> There are three subcategories of unprovoked attack:\n* Hit-and-run attack \u2013 usually non-fatal, the shark bites and then leaves; most victims do not see the shark. This is the most common type of attack and typically occurs in the surf zone or in murky water. Most hit-and-run attacks are believed to be the result of mistaken identity.<ref name=\"ISAF-HWW\">{{cite web |url=http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/sharks/attacks/howwhen.htm |title=How, When, & Where Sharks Attack |author=Burgess, George H. |authorlink=George H. Burgess |publisher=International Shark Attack File |accessdate=26 June 2012}}</ref>\n* Sneak attack \u2013 the victim will not usually see the shark, and may sustain multiple deep bites. This kind of attack is predatory in nature and is often carried out with the intention of consuming the victim. It is extraordinarily rare for this to occur.\n* Bump-and-bite attack \u2013 the shark circles and bumps the victim before biting. Great whites are known to do this on occasion, referred to as a \"test bite\", in which the great white is attempting to identify what is being bitten. Repeated bites, depending on the reaction of the victim (thrashing or panicking may lead the shark to believe the victim is prey), are not uncommon and can be severe or fatal. Bump-and-bite attacks are not believed to be the result of mistaken identity.<ref name=\"ISAF-HWW\"/>\n\nAn incident occurred in 2011 when a 3-meter long great white shark jumped onto a 7-person [[research vessel]] off [[Seal Island, South Africa]]. The crew were undertaking a [[animal population study|population study]] using sardines as bait, and the incident was judged to be an accident.<ref>{{cite news | first = Xan | last = Rice | title = Great white shark jumps from sea into research boat | date = 19 July 2011 | publisher = [[Guardian Media Group]] | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jul/19/great-white-shark-jumps-boat | work = [[The Guardian]] | accessdate = 20 July 2011 | quote = Marine researchers in South Africa had a narrow escape after a three-metre-long great white shark breached the surface of the sea and leaped into their boat, becoming trapped on deck for more than an hour.
