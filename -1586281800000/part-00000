Records of land transactions which were made in the first quarter of the 18th century suggest that a significant agricultural community already existed in the area by that period. A small group of houses had been built along the present Main Street by the turn of the 19th century; this settlement was known as \"Bridge Branch\" for the nearby stream, which was crossed by a bridge as early as 1730. By 1804, the community had grown sufficiently to merit the establishment of a post office. The village was formally recognized in 1810, when an Act of the Assembly was passed to establish its name as \"Bridgeville.\"  Early 19th century industries included a water-powered mill, tanyard, charcoal furnace, and fruit-drying business. The growth of the town accelerated greatly upon the arrival of the [[Delaware Railroad]] in Bridgeville in 1856.  The town was subsequently laid out for development by [[William Cannon]] (1809-1865).<ref name=NRHPnom>{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=94000361}} |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Bridgeville Historic District|author=Peter E.

Records of land transactions which were made in the first quarter of the 18th century suggest that a significant agricultural community already existed in the area by that period. A small group of houses had been built along the present Main Street by the turn of the 19th century; this settlement was known as \"Bridge Branch\" for the nearby stream, which was crossed by a bridge as early as 1730. By 1804, the community had grown sufficiently to merit the establishment of a post office. The village was formally recognized in 1810, when an Act of the Assembly was passed to establish its name as \"Bridgeville.\"  Early 19th century industries included a water-powered mill, tanyard, charcoal furnace, and fruit-drying business. The growth of the town accelerated greatly upon the arrival of the [[Delaware Railroad]] in Bridgeville in 1856.  The town was subsequently laid out for development by [[William Cannon]] (1809-1865).<ref name=NRHPnom>{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=94000361}} |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Bridgeville Historic District|author=Peter E.

The largest central bus terminal in the country is the [[Tel Aviv Central Bus Station]], which is also the second largest bus terminal in the world.\n\nOn August 5, 2010, the Ministry of Transport opened a website that contained information about public bus and train routes in the country.<ref>http://www.bus.gov.il</ref> Previously, information was given only by the individual public transit operators.<ref>http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3930960,00.html</ref>\n\n==== Bus rapid transit ====\nIsrael has one [[bus rapid transit]] system in [[Haifa]], called the [[Metronit]], which consists of three lines connecting Haifa to its suburbs.

The shared ''sherut'' service usually appears a yellow minivans and travel along the same path as the normal buses with identical route numbers. For a slightly higher price, the shared ''sherut'' service allows passengers to both hop on and hop off anywhere along the path of travel. During peak travel, often the time of travel can be shortened as the number of passengers is significantly small compared to normal bus services. Some routes continue to travel through the night and on Shabbat providing transport needs to the population when normal buses services cease. The beginning and end of the ''sherut'' vans may differ from the central bus station and on the weekends and evenings, the routes can also be altered for some services.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} In 2015, share taxis carried 34.7 million passengers, 15.2 million of which were transported on city routes, with the rest going to suburban and inter-city routes.<ref name=\"themarket-sherut\">{{cite news|url=http://www.themarker.com/dynamo/1.4104064|title=\u05e8\u05e4\u05d5\u05e8\u05de\u05d4 \u05d1\u05de\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05e9\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea: \u05de\u05e9\u05e8\u05d3 \u05d4\u05ea\u05d7\u05d1\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4 \u05d9\u05e6\u05d9\u05d2 \u05db-100 \u05e7\u05d5\u05d5\u05d9\u05dd \u05d7\u05d3\u05e9\u05d9\u05dd|trans-title=Share Taxi Reform: Transportation Ministry to Introduce About 100 New Lines|author=Dori, Oren|work=[[TheMarker]]|date=May 18, 2017|accessdate=May 23, 2017|language=he}}</ref>\n\n=== Private taxis ===\n[[Taxicab|Taxis]], often called \"special taxis\" ({{lang-he|\u05e1\u05e4\u05d9\u05d9\u05e9\u05dc}}) in Israel, to distinguish them from share taxis, are regulated by the Ministry of Transport.

The first line was the [[Jaffa\u2013Jerusalem railway]], followed by the [[Jezreel Valley railway]], which formed part of the greater [[Hejaz railway]]. [[World War I]] brought the creation of multiple new lines out of military needs: Portions of what is now [[Coastal railway line, Israel|the Coastal railway]] were built simultaneously by the Turkish and British and later merged during the British Mandate. [[Railway to Beersheba|Southern lines]] were also built by the warring states\u2014from the north by the Ottomans, and from [[Rafah]] in the west by the British.\n\nBeginning in the mid-1960s, railway development stagnated, and a number of lines (notably, the Jezreel Valley railway and most of the [[Eastern Railway (Israel)|Eastern railway]]) were abandoned altogether.  Development restarted in the 1990s, the opening of [[Tel Aviv]]'s Ayalon railway in 1993 signaling a new era of rail development. Lines under construction in the 2000s include the [[high-speed railway to Jerusalem]], an extension of the coastal railway directly from Tel Aviv to [[Ashdod]] through the northern [[Shephelah]], and a line from [[Ashkelon]] to [[Beersheba]] via [[Sderot]], [[Netivot]] and [[Ofakim]], as well as a complete reconstruction of the line from [[Lod]] to Beersheba. These and other extensive infrastructure improvements led to a 20-fold increase in the number of passengers served by Israel Railways between 1990 and 2015.\n\nAfter numerous delays due to the complexity of the project, a new line between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem opened in 2019. This line is the first electrified railway ever built in the country. Israel Railways has ordered [[Bombardier Traxx]] electric locomotives for use on this line and for other lines to be converted to electric operation. All existing and future electrified mainline railways in Israel use 25\u00a0kV 50\u00a0Hz overhead electrification.\n\n===Light rail/subway===\nThe 13-kilometre-long [[Jerusalem Light Rail]] system began operation in August 2011 and is being extended. The construction of the [[Tel Aviv Light Rail]] has begun and the first line is set to be completed between 2018 and 2023. A significant portion of it will be underground. Haifa's [[Carmelit]] is currently the only subway line in Israel. It is listed in ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' as the shortest subway system in the world, being the second smallest track network (after the [[T\u00fcnel]] in [[Istanbul]],) but being the smallest \"system\" by virtue of being the only urban rail network in the city.

The largest central bus terminal in the country is the [[Tel Aviv Central Bus Station]], which is also the second largest bus terminal in the world.\n\nOn August 5, 2010, the Ministry of Transport opened a website that contained information about public bus and train routes in the country.<ref>http://www.bus.gov.il</ref> Previously, information was given only by the individual public transit operators.<ref>http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3930960,00.html</ref>\n\n==== Bus rapid transit ====\nIsrael has one [[bus rapid transit]] system in [[Haifa]], called the [[Metronit]], which consists of three lines connecting Haifa to its suburbs.

The shared ''sherut'' service usually appears a yellow minivans and travel along the same path as the normal buses with identical route numbers. For a slightly higher price, the shared ''sherut'' service allows passengers to both hop on and hop off anywhere along the path of travel. During peak travel, often the time of travel can be shortened as the number of passengers is significantly small compared to normal bus services. Some routes continue to travel through the night and on Shabbat providing transport needs to the population when normal buses services cease. The beginning and end of the ''sherut'' vans may differ from the central bus station and on the weekends and evenings, the routes can also be altered for some services.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} In 2015, share taxis carried 34.7 million passengers, 15.2 million of which were transported on city routes, with the rest going to suburban and inter-city routes.<ref name=\"themarket-sherut\">{{cite news|url=http://www.themarker.com/dynamo/1.4104064|title=\u05e8\u05e4\u05d5\u05e8\u05de\u05d4 \u05d1\u05de\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05e9\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea: \u05de\u05e9\u05e8\u05d3 \u05d4\u05ea\u05d7\u05d1\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4 \u05d9\u05e6\u05d9\u05d2 \u05db-100 \u05e7\u05d5\u05d5\u05d9\u05dd \u05d7\u05d3\u05e9\u05d9\u05dd|trans-title=Share Taxi Reform: Transportation Ministry to Introduce About 100 New Lines|author=Dori, Oren|work=[[TheMarker]]|date=May 18, 2017|accessdate=May 23, 2017|language=he}}</ref>\n\n=== Private taxis ===\n[[Taxicab|Taxis]], often called \"special taxis\" ({{lang-he|\u05e1\u05e4\u05d9\u05d9\u05e9\u05dc}}) in Israel, to distinguish them from share taxis, are regulated by the Ministry of Transport.

The first line was the [[Jaffa\u2013Jerusalem railway]], followed by the [[Jezreel Valley railway]], which formed part of the greater [[Hejaz railway]]. [[World War I]] brought the creation of multiple new lines out of military needs: Portions of what is now [[Coastal railway line, Israel|the Coastal railway]] were built simultaneously by the Turkish and British and later merged during the British Mandate. [[Railway to Beersheba|Southern lines]] were also built by the warring states\u2014from the north by the Ottomans, and from [[Rafah]] in the west by the British.\n\nBeginning in the mid-1960s, railway development stagnated, and a number of lines (notably, the Jezreel Valley railway and most of the [[Eastern Railway (Israel)|Eastern railway]]) were abandoned altogether.  Development restarted in the 1990s, the opening of [[Tel Aviv]]'s Ayalon railway in 1993 signaling a new era of rail development. Lines under construction in the 2000s include the [[high-speed railway to Jerusalem]], an extension of the coastal railway directly from Tel Aviv to [[Ashdod]] through the northern [[Shephelah]], and a line from [[Ashkelon]] to [[Beersheba]] via [[Sderot]], [[Netivot]] and [[Ofakim]], as well as a complete reconstruction of the line from [[Lod]] to Beersheba. These and other extensive infrastructure improvements led to a 20-fold increase in the number of passengers served by Israel Railways between 1990 and 2015.\n\nAfter numerous delays due to the complexity of the project, a new line between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem opened in 2019. This line is the first electrified railway ever built in the country. Israel Railways has ordered [[Bombardier Traxx]] electric locomotives for use on this line and for other lines to be converted to electric operation. All existing and future electrified mainline railways in Israel use 25kV 50Hz overhead electrification.\n\n===Light rail/subway===\nThe 13-kilometre-long [[Jerusalem Light Rail]] system began operation in August 2011 and is being extended. The construction of the [[Tel Aviv Light Rail]] has begun and the first line is set to be completed between 2018 and 2023. A significant portion of it will be underground. Haifa's [[Carmelit]] is currently the only subway line in Israel. It is listed in ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' as the shortest subway system in the world, being the second smallest track network (after the [[T\u00fcnel]] in [[Istanbul]],) but being the smallest \"system\" by virtue of being the only urban rail network in the city. The [[Haifa\u2013Nazareth railway]], a planned light rail system from [[Haifa]] to [[Nazareth]], is planned to open in 2025, and a light rail system for [[Beersheba]] is currently planned.\n\n===Israel Public Transportation Statistics===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Israel, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 70 min. 22% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 16 min, while 25% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 13.6 km, while 29.% travel for over 12 km in a single direction. <ref>{{cite web|title=Israel Public Transportation Statistics|publisher= Global Public Transit Index by Moovit|url=https://moovitapp.com/insights/en/Moovit_Insights_Public_Transit_Index_Israel_Israel-1|accessdate=June 19, 2017}} [[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50px]] Material was copied from this source, which is available under a [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License].</ref>\n\n== Air transport ==\n[[File:PikiWiki Israel 11466 Airport reception hall.JPG|thumb|right|Arrivals hall at Ben Gurion International Airport's Terminal 3]]\nIsrael has 47 airports, the largest and most well known being [[Ben Gurion Airport]] (TLV) located near [[Tel Aviv]], which is used by most international flights to Israel.

Therefore, the phonemic interpretation of letters in [[loanword]]s depends on the donating language. However, Danish tends to preserve the original spelling of loanwords. In particular, a 'c' that represents {{IPA|/s/}} is almost never normalized to 's' in Danish, as would most often happen in Norwegian. Many words originally derived from [[Latin]] roots retain 'c' in their Danish spelling, for example Norwegian ''sentrum'' vs Danish ''centrum''. However, the letter 'c' representing {{IPA|/k\u02b0/}} is mostly normalized to 'k'. The letter 'q' is used in a few loanwords like ''quiz'' (from English), but ''qu'' is normally replaced by ''kv'' in words from Latin (e.g. ''kvadrat'') and by ''k'' in words from French (e.g. ''karant\u00e6ne''). The letter 'x' is normally replaced by ''ks'' in words from Latin, Greek, or French, e.g. ''eksempel, maksimal, tekst, heksagon, seksuel''; but 'x' is retained: 1) at the beginning of words of Greek origin, where it sounds {{IPA|/s/}}, e.g. ''xylograf, xylofon''; 2) before 'c' in words of Latin origin, e.g. ''excellent, excentrisk''; 3) in chemical terms, e.g. ''oxalsyre, oxygen''; 4) in loanwords \nfrom English, e.g. ''exitpoll, foxterrier, maxi, sex, taxi''; 5) at the end of French loanwords, where it is silent, e.g. ''jaloux'' {{IPA|[\u0255\u00e6\u02c8lu]}}. The verb ''exe/ekse'', derived from the name of the letter 'x' itself, can be spelled either way. The letter 'x' is also used instead of ''eks-'' in abbreviations: ''fx (for eksempel'', also written ''f. eks.), hhx (h\u00f8jere handelseksamen), htx (h\u00f8jere teknisk eksamen)''.\n\nThe \"foreign\" letters also sometimes appear in the spelling of otherwise-indigenous family names. For example, many of the Danish families that use the surname ''Skov'' (literally: \"Forest\") spell it ''Schou''.\n\n==Diacritics==\nStandard Danish orthography has no compulsory diacritics, but allows the use of an [[acute accent]] for disambiguation. Most often, an accent on ''e'' marks a stressed syllable in one of a pair of [[homograph]]s that have different stresses, for example ''en dreng'' (a boy) versus ''\u00e9n dreng'' (one boy). It can also be part of the official spelling such as in ''all\u00e9'' (avenue) or ''id\u00e9'' (idea).\n\nLess often, any vowel except ''[[\u00e5]]'' may be accented to indicate stress on a ''word'', either to clarify the meaning of the sentence, or to ease the reading otherwise. For example: ''jeg st\u00f3d op'' (\"I was standing\"), versus ''jeg stod \u00f3p'' (\"I got out of bed\"); ''hunden g\u00f8r (det)'' (\"the dog does (it)\"), versus ''hunden g\u01ffr'' (\"the dog barks\").{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Most often, however, such distinctions are made using typographical emphasis (italics, underlining) or simply left to the reader to infer from the context, and the use of accents in such cases may appear dated. A common context in which the explicit acute accent is preferred is to disambiguate ''en''/''et'' (''a'', [[indefinite article]]) and ''\u00e9n''/''\u00e9t'' (''one'', [[numeral (linguistics)|numeral]]) in central places in official written materials such as advertising, where clarity is important.\n\n==History==\nThere were [[spelling reform]]s in 1872, 1889 (with some changes in 1892), and 1948.\n\nDanish formerly used both ''\u00f8'' (in [[Antiqua (typeface class)|Antiqua]]) and ''\u00f6'' (in [[Fraktur]]), though it was suggested to use ''\u00f8'' for IPA /\u00f8/ and ''\u00f6'' for IPA /\u0153/, which was also sometimes employed.<ref name=\"DSfD\">N.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;Petersen: ''D\u00e4nische Sprachlehre f\u00fcr Deutsche'' (i.e. Danish Grammar for Germans), Kopenhagen, 1830, p. 1\u20133 ([https://books.google.de/books?id=-DtJAAAAcAAJ at books.google])</ref> The distinction between ''\u00f8'' and ''\u00f6'' was optionally allowed in 1872, recommended in 1889, but rejected in 1892, although the [[Retskrivningsordbogen|orthographic dictionaries]] continued to use ''\u00f8'' and ''\u00f6'' (collated as if they were the same letter) until 1918.\n\nEarlier instead of ''aa'' the letter ''\u00e5'' or a ligature of two ''a'' was also used.<ref name=\"DSfD\">N.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;Petersen: ''D\u00e4nische Sprachlehre f\u00fcr Deutsche'' (i.e. Danish Grammar for Germans), Kopenhagen, 1830, p. 1\u20133 ([https://books.google.de/books?id=-DtJAAAAcAAJ at books.google])</ref>\nIn 1948 the letter ''\u00e5'' was re-introduced or officially introduced in Danish, replacing ''aa''. The letter then came from the [[Swedish alphabet]], where it has been in official use since the 18th century. The initial proposal was to place \u00c5 first in the Danish alphabet, before ''A''. Its place as the last letter of the alphabet, as in Norwegian, was decided in 1955.<ref>[[Einar Lundeby]]: \"Bolle-\u00e5-ens plass i det danske alfabet\" [The placing of \u00c5 in the Danish alphabet] in Spr\u00e5knytt, 1995/4. http://www.sprakrad.no/Toppmeny/Publikasjoner/Spraaknytt/Arkivet/Spraaknytt_1995/Spraaknytt-1995-4/Bolle-aa-ens_plass_i_det_dans/</ref> The former [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]] ''Aa'' still occurs in personal names, and in Danish geographical names.<!--some towns use the Aa spelling as the \"official one\", e.g. Faaborg and Aabenraa, and Aa is extremely common in names derived from farms as such names normally end in \"-gaard\", e.g. \"Vestergaard\" --> ''Aa'' remains in use as a transliteration, if the letter is not available for technical reasons. ''Aa'' is treated like ''\u00c5'' in [[Collation|alphabetical sorting]], not like two adjacent letters ''A'', meaning that while ''a'' is the first letter of the alphabet, ''aa'' is the last.\n\nThe difference between the Dano-Norwegian and the [[Swedish alphabet]] is that Swedish uses the variant ''[[\u00c4]]'' instead of ''\u00c6'', and the variant ''[[\u00d6]]'' instead of ''\u00d8'' \u2014 similar to [[German language|German]]. Also, the [[Collation|collating order]] for these three letters is different: ''\u00c5, \u00c4, \u00d6''.\n\nIn current Danish, ''W'' is recognized as a separate letter from ''V''. The transition was made in 1980{{cn|date=April 2014}}; before that, the ''W'' was merely considered to be a variation of the letter ''V'' and words using it were alphabetized accordingly (e.g.: \"Wales, Vall\u00f8, Washington, Wedellsborg, Vendsyssel\"). The Danish version of the [[alphabet song]] still states that the alphabet has 28 letters; the last line reads ''otte-og-tyve skal der st\u00e5'', i.e. \"that makes twenty-eight\".

Therefore, the phonemic interpretation of letters in [[loanword]]s depends on the donating language. However, Danish tends to preserve the original spelling of loanwords. In particular, a 'c' that represents {{IPA|/s/}} is almost never normalized to 's' in Danish, as would most often happen in Norwegian. Many words originally derived from [[Latin]] roots retain 'c' in their Danish spelling, for example Norwegian ''sentrum'' vs Danish ''centrum''. However, the letter 'c' representing {{IPA|/k\u02b0/}} is mostly normalized to 'k'. The letter 'q' is used in a few loanwords like ''quiz'' (from English), but ''qu'' is normally replaced by ''kv'' in words from Latin (e.g. ''kvadrat'') and by ''k'' in words from French (e.g. ''karant\u00e6ne''). The letter 'x' is normally replaced by ''ks'' in words from Latin, Greek, or French, e.g. ''eksempel, maksimal, tekst, heksagon, seksuel''; but 'x' is retained: 1) at the beginning of words of Greek origin, where it sounds {{IPA|/s/}}, e.g. ''xylograf, xylofon''; 2) before 'c' in words of Latin origin, e.g. ''excellent, excentrisk''; 3) in chemical terms, e.g. ''oxalsyre, oxygen''; 4) in loanwords \nfrom English, e.g. ''exitpoll, foxterrier, maxi, sex, taxi''; 5) at the end of French loanwords, where it is silent, e.g. ''jaloux'' {{IPA|[\u0255\u00e6\u02c8lu]}}. The verb ''exe/ekse'', derived from the name of the letter 'x' itself, can be spelled either way. The letter 'x' is also used instead of ''eks-'' in abbreviations: ''fx (for eksempel'', also written ''f. eks.), hhx (h\u00f8jere handelseksamen), htx (h\u00f8jere teknisk eksamen)''.\n\nThe \"foreign\" letters also sometimes appear in the spelling of otherwise-indigenous family names. For example, many of the Danish families that use the surname ''Skov'' (literally: \"Forest\") spell it ''Schou''.\n\n==Diacritics==\nStandard Danish orthography has no compulsory diacritics, but allows the use of an [[acute accent]] for disambiguation. Most often, an accent on ''e'' marks a stressed syllable in one of a pair of [[homograph]]s that have different stresses, for example ''en dreng'' (a boy) versus ''\u00e9n dreng'' (one boy). It can also be part of the official spelling such as in ''all\u00e9'' (avenue) or ''id\u00e9'' (idea).\n\nLess often, any vowel except ''[[\u00e5]]'' may be accented to indicate stress on a ''word'', either to clarify the meaning of the sentence, or to ease the reading otherwise. For example: ''jeg st\u00f3d op'' (\"I was standing\"), versus ''jeg stod \u00f3p'' (\"I got out of bed\"); ''hunden g\u00f8r (det)'' (\"the dog does (it)\"), versus ''hunden g\u01ffr'' (\"the dog barks\").{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Most often, however, such distinctions are made using typographical emphasis (italics, underlining) or simply left to the reader to infer from the context, and the use of accents in such cases may appear dated. A common context in which the explicit acute accent is preferred is to disambiguate ''en''/''et'' (''a'', [[indefinite article]]) and ''\u00e9n''/''\u00e9t'' (''one'', [[numeral (linguistics)|numeral]]) in central places in official written materials such as advertising, where clarity is important.\n\n==History==\nThere were [[spelling reform]]s in 1872, 1889 (with some changes in 1892), and 1948.\n\nDanish formerly used both ''\u00f8'' (in [[Antiqua (typeface class)|Antiqua]]) and ''\u00f6'' (in [[Fraktur]]), though it was suggested to use ''\u00f8'' for IPA /\u00f8/ and ''\u00f6'' for IPA /\u0153/, which was also sometimes employed.<ref name=\"DSfD\">N.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;Petersen: ''D\u00e4nische Sprachlehre f\u00fcr Deutsche'' (i.e. Danish Grammar for Germans), Kopenhagen, 1830, p. 1\u20133 ([https://books.google.de/books?id=-DtJAAAAcAAJ at books.google])</ref> The distinction between ''\u00f8'' and ''\u00f6'' was optionally allowed in 1872, recommended in 1889, but rejected in 1892, although the [[Retskrivningsordbogen|orthographic dictionaries]] continued to use ''\u00f8'' and ''\u00f6'' (collated as if they were the same letter) until 1918.\n\nEarlier instead of ''aa'' the letter ''\u00e5'' or a ligature of two ''a'' was also used.<ref name=\"DSfD\">N.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;Petersen: ''D\u00e4nische Sprachlehre f\u00fcr Deutsche'' (i.e. Danish Grammar for Germans), Kopenhagen, 1830, p. 1\u20133 ([https://books.google.de/books?id=-DtJAAAAcAAJ at books.google])</ref>\nIn 1948 the letter ''\u00e5'' was re-introduced or officially introduced in Danish, replacing ''aa''. The letter then came from the [[Swedish alphabet]], where it has been in official use since the 18th century. The initial proposal was to place \u00c5 first in the Danish alphabet, before ''A''. Its place as the last letter of the alphabet, as in Norwegian, was decided in 1955.<ref>[[Einar Lundeby]]: \"Bolle-\u00e5-ens plass i det danske alfabet\" [The placing of \u00c5 in the Danish alphabet] in Spr\u00e5knytt, 1995/4. http://www.sprakrad.no/Toppmeny/Publikasjoner/Spraaknytt/Arkivet/Spraaknytt_1995/Spraaknytt-1995-4/Bolle-aa-ens_plass_i_det_dans/</ref> The former [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]] ''Aa'' still occurs in personal names, and in Danish geographical names.<!--some towns use the Aa spelling as the \"official one\", e.g. Faaborg and Aabenraa, and Aa is extremely common in names derived from farms as such names normally end in \"-gaard\", e.g. \"Vestergaard\" --> ''Aa'' remains in use as a transliteration, if the letter is not available for technical reasons. ''Aa'' is treated like ''\u00c5'' in [[Collation|alphabetical sorting]], not like two adjacent letters ''A'', meaning that while ''a'' is the first letter of the alphabet, ''aa'' is the last.\n\nThe difference between the Dano-Norwegian and the [[Swedish alphabet]] is that Swedish uses the variant ''[[\u00c4]]'' instead of ''\u00c6'', and the variant ''[[\u00d6]]'' instead of ''\u00d8'' \u2014 similar to [[German language|German]]. Also, the [[Collation|collating order]] for these three letters is different: ''\u00c5, \u00c4, \u00d6''.\n\nIn current Danish, ''W'' is recognized as a separate letter from ''V''. The transition was made in 1980{{cn|date=April 2014}}; before that, the ''W'' was merely considered to be a variation of the letter ''V'' and words using it were alphabetized accordingly (e.g.: \"Wales, Vall\u00f8, Washington, Wedellsborg, Vendsyssel\"). The Danish version of the [[alphabet song]] still states that the alphabet has 28 letters; the last line reads ''otte-og-tyve skal der st\u00e5'', i.e. \"that makes twenty-eight\". However, today the letter \"w\" is considered an official letter.\n\nAll nouns in Danish used to be capitalized, as in German. The reform of 1948 abolished the capitalization of all nouns.\n\n==Computing standards==\n[[Image:Illuminated keyboard 2.JPG|thumb|Danish keyboard with keys for \u00c6, \u00d8, and \u00c5.]]\n\nIn [[computer|computing]], several different coding standards have existed for this alphabet:\n\n* [[DS 2089]], later established in international standard [[ISO 646]]\n* [[IBM PC]] [[code page]] 865\n* [[ISO 8859-1]]\n* [[Unicode]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Comparison of Norwegian Bokm\u00e5l and Standard Danish#Writing_system]]\n* [[Comparison of Norwegian Bokm\u00e5l and Standard Danish#Pronunciation and sound system]]\n* [[Danish braille]]\n* [[Danish phonology]]\n* [[Icelandic orthography]]\n* [[Runic alphabet|Futhark]], the Germanic runes used formerly\n* [[Spelling alphabet#Latin alphabets|Spelling alphabets]]\n* [[Swedish alphabet]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat|Danish alphabet}}\n* [http://danish.typeit.org Type Danish characters online]\n* [http://www.kb.dk/e-mat/dod/130020837412_color.pdf 1872 spelling reform (in Danish)]\n* [https://dsn.dk/lovtekster/Bekendtg_1892.pdf 1892 spelling reform (in Danish)]\n* [https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=73010 1948 spelling reform (in Danish)]\n* [https://dsn.dk/retskrivning/retskrivningsregler Current orthographic rules (in Danish)]\n\n{{Danish language}}\n{{Language orthographies}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Danish Orthography}}\n[[Category:Latin-script orthographies]]\n[[Category:Danish language|Orthography]]\n", "name_user": "Nardog", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eAlphabet:fixingDanish IPA", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_orthography"}

Directed by [[Norman McCabe]], the cartoon satirizes various events of [[World War II]]. The title is a pun on ''[[dictator]]''.\n\n==Story==\nThe cartoon takes place on a [[farm]], beginning with a few [[ducks]], [[geese]] and [[chickens]] being shown. After a brief few moments, two ducks (who are expecting a duckling) go over to their unusually black-colored egg as it starts to hatch. Once the egg has hatched, a duckling with an [[Adolf Hitler]] appearance emerges and yells \"[[Sieg Heil]]!\" while giving the [[Nazi salute]].\n\nAfter time passes, the Hitler duck grows into adulthood, holding aggressive speeches toward other ducks and geese. One goose, representing [[Benito Mussolini]], agrees with him and gives the Nazi salute. Afterward, a postcard from The Management of the Theatre that says \"We wish to apologize to the NICE DUCKS and GEESE who may be in the audience\" is shown. The Hitler duck then gathers up a group of soldiers to join him in his own [[Axis Powers]] [[Army]], including a [[Daffy Duck]]-like character, who claims to be from South Germany. The Mussolini goose then delivers a speech to the only listener: a little chick who had been forced to stay and applaud. After these happenings, storm troopers are sent marching across the area, while the [[Doves as symbols|Dove of Peace]] (imitation of [[Charles Laughton]], possibly representing [[Franklin Roosevelt]]), grieves at what is happening (\"Have they forgot? 'Tis love that's right, and naught is gained by show of might.\").\n\nA group of chickens and the Mussolini goose are then seen at what appears to be a [[Peace conference|Peace Conference]], in which the Hitler duck slaps the Mussolini goose for dim-wittedly taking part in it and puts the newly signed [[peace treaty]] through a [[Paper shredder|shredder]], whereupon everyone in the Peace Conference area brawl against each other.\n\nAnother duck with large teeth and round glasses holding the flag of the [[Empire of Japan]], representing [[Hideki Tojo]], is seen swimming across the water and placing the flag (with the words \"[[South Pacific Mandate|Japanese Mandate Island]]\" written on the back of the flag) on a tiny island that turns out to be a [[turtle]], who emerges from the water and chases the duck, beating him with the \"Japanese Mandate Island\" sign as he is now on the warpath against Tojo. The Japanese duck tries to get out of being beaten by flashing a badge that reads, \"I Am [[Chinese people|Chinese]],\" but to no avail. \"Yeah, and I'm [[mock turtle soup]]!\" shouts the infuriated turtle sarcastically. A subtitle below the badge states that it was made in Japan, which may explain why the turtle did not buy the ruse.\n\nThe three (Hitler Duck, Mussolini Goose and Tojo Duck) are then seen marching across a field while singing a parody of \"[[One, Two, Buckle My Shoe]]\" (\"One two, button my shoe. Three four, shut honorable door\"), they're joined by a newly born duckling straight from an egg, who has a soft [[Spanish people|Spanish]] accent, alluding to the supposed fourth wheel of the Nazi empire: either [[Francoist Spain|Spanish dictator]] [[Francisco Franco]] or [[United Officers' Group|Argentine dictator]] [[Pedro Pablo Ram\u00edrez]].\n\nThe Dove then tries to reason with the Axis Powers. However, they ignore him and trample him. His temper reaching breaking point, the Dove yells at the Axis Powers to \"STOP!!\". The Dove proceeds to [[combat]] against the Tojo duck who is rubbing his hands in a sinister way, the Hitler duck and the Mussolini goose, as well as their storm troopers. With the help of a group of chickens, the baby chick who had been forced to cheer for the Mussolini goose earlier after being captured (how he was rescued is not explained), a crazy rabbit with a mustache (impersonating [[Jerry Colonna (entertainer)|Jerry Colonna]] and possibly representing [[Joseph Stalin]]) wielding a large wooden hammer for a weapon and hiding in a barrel which he also uses for transportation and a [[Minuteman]] that emerges from a poster that says \"For Victory, Buy United States [[Victory Bond]]s\" and fires his [[musket]] at the fleeing trio, the Dove overthrows the Axis Powers and saves the day.\n\nYears later, the Dove, now a brave war hero, has two children (one named \"Peace\", the other named \"Quiet\"). The Dove explains to his children that even though he hates war, he chose to be brave and stand up against the Axis Powers. The Dove then points out to his children that his enemies (the Hitler and Tojo ducks and the Mussolini goose) are now [[taxidermy|taxidermied]] [[moose]]-head [[Hunting trophy|trophies]] above his [[fireplace]] in beaten up appearances.\n\nThe final message of the cartoon [[Fourth wall|states to the U.S. audience]] that if they wish to defeat the Axis Powers and bring peace to the world once again, all they have to do to ensure the country's victory is to buy [[United States Treasury security|United States Savings Bonds]] and [[Revenue stamp|Stamps]].\n\n==Political references==\nThe first duckling to hatch from the egg had a mustache and a [[Nazi]] emblem throughout the cartoon, indicating that the duck symbolized [[Adolf Hitler]]. The goose who helped the duck had an open [[Italian language|Italian]] accent, and the chick at the end of one of his speeches could be heard yelling \"[[Duce]]!\" multiple times, indicating that this goose is Benito Mussolini. The other duck was using the flag of the Empire of Japan, and openly singing'' \"[[The Japanese Sandman]]\"''. He is presumably intended to be [[Hideki Tojo]], judging by the military hat he is wearing. The black duck may be a reference to [[Erwin Rommel|Rommel]] as he was also from South Germany and spoke with an [[Swabian German|accent]], but can also relate to how African Americans were a huge demographic in the [[Southeast United States|Southern United States]] at the time.\n\n==Changes in Sunset Productions version==\nThe ending where the dove is sitting with his kids and points out that his enemies have been defeated (and are now moose-heads above the fireplace), followed by a notice to buy war bonds, has been rarely seen since the short was sold to [[Sunset Productions]] in the 1950s and syndicated through them (as Guild Films). As the cartoon is in the public domain, this edited version has frequently been found on VHS and DVD home video collections. However, on the [[Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 6]] DVD set and the World War II cartoons special on the Cartoon Network show ''ToonHeads'', the full ending is shown uncut and uncensored.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://looney.goldenagecartoons.com/ltcuts/d/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-09-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505014827/http://looney.goldenagecartoons.com/ltcuts/d/ |archivedate=2016-05-05 }}</ref>\ndon't forget the chicken strips added towards the end of the play\n\n==Availability==\nDue to the short's World War II stereotypes, it has rarely been shown on American television, except for [[Cartoon Network]] as part of its anthology television show, ''[[ToonHeads]]''.

The gibbons ([[Family (biology)|family]] [[Hylobatidae]]) and [[orangutan]]s (genus ''Pongo'') were the first groups to split from the [[lineage (evolution)|line]] leading to the humans, then [[gorilla]]s (genus ''Gorilla'') followed by the chimpanzee (genus ''[[Pan (genus)|Pan]]''). The splitting date between human and chimpanzee lineages is placed around 4\u20138 million years ago during the late [[Miocene]] epoch.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Ruvolo M | year = 1997 | title = Genetic Diversity in Hominoid Primates | url = | journal = Annual Review of Anthropology | volume = 26 | issue = | pages = 515\u201340 | doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.26.1.515}}</ref><ref name=Ruvolo1997>{{cite journal |author=Ruvolo, Maryellen |title=Molecular phylogeny of the hominoids: inferences from multiple independent DNA sequence data sets |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=248\u201365 |year=1997 |pmid=9066793 |doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a025761  }}</ref> During this split, [[chromosome 2]] was formed from two other chromosomes, leaving humans with only 23 pairs of chromosomes, compared to 24 for the other apes.<ref name=\"fusion\">[http://www.evolutionpages.com/chromosome_2.htm Human Chromosome 2 is a fusion of two ancestral chromosomes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809040210/http://www.evolutionpages.com/chromosome_2.htm |date=9 August 2011 }} by Alec MacAndrew; accessed 18 May 2006.</ref>\n\n====Evidence from the fossil record====\nThere is little fossil evidence for the divergence of the gorilla, chimpanzee and hominin lineages.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Begun David R |year=2010 |title=Miocene Hominids and the Origins of the African Apes and Humans |url= |journal=Annual Review of Anthropology |volume=39 |issue= |pages=67\u201384 |doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.012809.105047}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author1=Begun David R. |author2=Nargolwalla Mariam C. |author3=Kordos Laszlo |year=2012 |title=European Miocene Hominids and the Origin of the African Ape and Human Clade |url= |journal=Evolutionary Anthropology |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=10\u201323 |doi=10.1002/evan.20329 |pmid=22307721}}</ref> The earliest fossils that have been proposed as members of the hominin lineage are ''[[Sahelanthropus tchadensis]]'' dating from {{mya|7}}, ''[[Orrorin tugenensis]]'' dating from {{mya|5.7}}, and ''[[Ardipithecus kadabba]]'' dating to {{mya|5.6}}.

Another important physiological change related to sexuality in humans was the evolution of [[hidden estrus]]. Humans are the only ape in which the female is intermittently fertile year round, and in which no special signals of fertility are produced by the body (such as [[genital swelling]] during estrus). Nonetheless humans retain a degree of sexual dimorphism in the distribution of body hair and subcutaneous fat, and in the overall size, males being around 25% larger than females. These changes taken together have been interpreted as a result of an increased emphasis on [[pair bonding]] as a possible solution to the requirement for increased parental investment due to the prolonged infancy of offspring.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n===Rise of ''Homo sapiens''===\n[[File:Map-of-human-migrations.jpg|thumb|World map of early human migrations according to [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial]] [[population genetics]] (numbers are [[millennia]] before present, the North Pole is at the center).]]\n{{main|Homo sapiens}}\n{{see|Archaic human admixture with modern humans|Early human migrations|Multiregional origin of modern humans|Prehistoric autopsy|Recent African origin of modern humans}}\nBy the beginning of the [[Upper Paleolithic]] period (50,000 [[Before Present|BP]]), and likely significantly earlier by 100\u201370,000 years ago<ref name=\"McBrearty Brooks 2000\" /><ref name=\"Henshilwood Marean 2003\" /><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Henshilwood | first1 = C.

The construction of the [[human pelvis]] differs from other [[primate]]s, as do the toes. A trade-off for these advantages of the modern human pelvis is that childbirth is more difficult and dangerous than in most [[mammal]]s, especially given the larger head size of human [[babies]] compared to other primates. Human babies must turn around as they pass through the birth canal while other primates do not, which makes humans the only species where females usually require help from their [[conspecific]]s (other members of their own species) to reduce the risks of birthing. As a partial [[evolution]]ary solution, human fetuses are born [[Altricial|less developed and more vulnerable]]. Chimpanzee babies are cognitively more developed than human babies until the age of six months, when the rapid development of human brains surpasses chimpanzees. Another difference between women and chimpanzee females is that women go through the [[menopause]] and become [[Infertility|unfertile]] decades before the end of their lives. All species of non-human apes are capable of giving birth until death. Menopause probably developed as it provides an evolutionary advantage of more caring time to relatives' young.<ref name=\"O'Neil\"/>\n\nApart from bipedalism, humans differ from chimpanzees mostly in [[smelling]], [[hearing]], [[digesting]] [[protein]]s, [[brain size]], and the ability of [[language]]. Humans' brains are about three times bigger than in chimpanzees. More importantly, the brain to body ratio is much higher in humans than in chimpanzees, and humans have a significantly more developed [[cerebral cortex]], with a larger number of [[neurons]]. The mental abilities of humans are remarkable compared to other apes. Humans' ability of [[speech]] is unique among primates.

During this process, the male inserts his [[erect penis]] into the female's [[vagina]] and [[ejaculate]]s semen, which contains sperm. The sperm travels through the vagina and cervix into the uterus or Fallopian tubes for [[human fertilization|fertilization]] of the ovum. Upon fertilization and [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]], gestation then occurs within the female's [[uterus]].\n\nThe [[zygote]] divides inside the female's uterus to become an [[embryo]], which over a period of 38 weeks (9 months) of [[gestation]] becomes a [[fetus]]. After this span of time, the fully grown fetus is [[childbirth|birthed]] from the woman's body and breathes independently as an infant for the first time. At this point, most modern cultures recognize the baby as a person entitled to the full protection of the law, though some jurisdictions extend various levels of [[personhood]] earlier to human fetuses while they remain in the uterus.\n\nCompared with other species, human childbirth is dangerous.

The genetic difference between sexes contributes to anatomical, hormonal, neural, and physiological differences between men and women, although the exact degree and nature of social and environmental influences on sexes are not completely understood. Males on average are 15% heavier and {{Convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on|lk=off|0}} taller than females. There is a difference between body types, body organs and systems, hormonal levels, sensory systems, and muscle mass between sexes. On average, men have about 40\u201350% more upper body strength and 20\u201330% more lower body strength than women. Women generally have a higher [[body fat]] percentage than men. Women have [[Human skin color#sexual dimorphism|lighter skin]] than men of the same population; this has been explained by a higher need for vitamin D (which is synthesized by sunlight) in females during pregnancy and [[lactation]]. As there are chromosomal differences between females and males, some X and Y chromosome related conditions and [[Disease|disorders]] only affect either men or women.

Most human biological variation is [[Cline (biology)|clinally]] distributed and blends gradually from one area to the next. Groups of people around the world have different frequencies of [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]] genes. Furthermore, different traits are non-concordant and each have different clinal distribution. Adaptability varies both from person to person and from population to population. The most efficient adaptive responses are found in geographical populations where the environmental stimuli are the strongest (e.g. [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]] are highly adapted to high altitudes). The clinal geographic genetic variation is further complicated by the migration and mixing between human populations which has been occurring since prehistoric times.<ref name=\"roberts1\"/><ref name=adapt3>{{cite web |last=O'Neil |first=Dennis |title=Adapting to High Altitude |url=http://anthro.palomar.edu/adapt/adapt_3.htm |work=Human Biological Adaptability |publisher=Palomar College |accessdate=6 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106210055/http://anthro.palomar.edu/adapt/adapt_3.htm |archivedate=6 January 2013 |df=}}</ref><ref name=adapt03>{{cite web |last=O'Neil |first=Dennis |title=Overview |url=http://anthro.palomar.edu/adapt/adapt_1.htm |work=Human Biological Adaptability |publisher=Palomar College |accessdate=6 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306124405/http://anthro.palomar.edu/adapt/adapt_1.htm |archivedate=6 March 2013 |df=}}</ref><ref name=\"vary02\">{{cite web |last=O'Neil |first=Dennis |title=Models of Classification |url=http://anthro.palomar.edu/vary/vary_2.htm |work=Modern Human Variation |publisher=Palomar College |accessdate=6 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106212400/http://anthro.palomar.edu/vary/vary_2.htm |archivedate=6 January 2013 |df=}}</ref><ref name=\"pbsmarks1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/race/000_About/002_04-background-01-08.htm|title=Interview with Jonathan Marks|last=Marks|first=Jonathan|date=|work=Race \u2013 The Power of an Illusion|publisher=PBS|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112143244/http://www.pbs.org/race/000_About/002_04-background-01-08.htm|archivedate=12 November 2012|accessdate=6 January 2013|layurl=https://www.pbs.org/race/000_General/000_00-Home.htm}}</ref><ref name=\"pbsgoodman1\">{{cite web |last=Goodman |first=Alan |title=Background Readings |url=https://www.pbs.org/race/000_About/002_04-background-01-10.htm |work=Race \u2013 Power of an Illusion |publisher=PBS |accessdate=6 January 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523034420/http://www.pbs.org/race/000_About/002_04-background-01-10.htm |archivedate=23 May 2013  }}</ref>\n\nHuman variation is highly non-concordant: most of the genes do not cluster together and are not inherited together. Skin and hair color are not correlated to height, weight, or athletic ability. Human species do not share the same patterns of variation through geography. Skin color varies with latitude and certain people are tall or have brown hair. There is a statistical correlation between particular features in a population, but different features are not expressed or inherited together. Thus, genes which code for superficial physical traits\u2014such as skin color, hair color, or height\u2014represent a minuscule and insignificant portion of the human genome and do not correlate with genetic affinity.

Humans are variously said to possess consciousness, [[self-awareness]], and a mind, which correspond roughly to the mental processes of [[thought]]. These are said to possess qualities such as self-awareness, [[sentience]], [[sapience]], and the ability to perceive the relationship between [[Personal identity|oneself]] and one's [[natural environment|environment]]. The extent to which the mind constructs or experiences the outer world is a matter of debate, as are the definitions and validity of many of the terms used above.\n\nThe physical aspects of the mind and brain, and by extension of the nervous system, are studied in the field of [[neurology]], the more behavioral in the field of psychology, and a sometimes loosely defined area between in the field of psychiatry, which treats mental illness and behavioral disorders. Psychology does not necessarily refer to the brain or nervous system, and can be framed purely in terms of [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenological]] or [[information processing]] theories of the mind. Increasingly, however, an understanding of brain functions is being included in psychological theory and practice, particularly in areas such as [[artificial intelligence]], [[neuropsychology]], and [[cognitive neuroscience]].\n\nThe nature of thought is central to psychology and related fields. [[Cognitive psychology]] studies [[cognition]], the [[mental function|mental processes']] underlying behavior. It uses [[information processing]] as a framework for understanding the mind. Perception, learning, problem solving, memory, attention, language and emotion are all well researched areas as well. Cognitive psychology is associated with a school of thought known as [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]], whose adherents argue for an [[information processing]] model of mental function, informed by [[positivism]] and [[experimental psychology]]. Techniques and models from cognitive psychology are widely applied and form the mainstay of psychological theories in many areas of both research and applied psychology. Largely focusing on the development of the human mind through the life span, [[developmental psychology]] seeks to understand how people come to perceive, understand, and act within the world and how these processes change as they age. This may focus on intellectual, cognitive, neural, social, or [[moral development]]. [[Psychologists]] have developed [[intelligence]] [[Test (assessment)|tests]] and the concept of [[intelligence quotient]] in order to assess the relative intelligence of human beings and study its [[Distribution (mathematics)|distribution]] among population.<ref>{{Britannica|289811|Intelligence test}}</ref>\n\nSome philosophers divide consciousness into phenomenal consciousness, which is experience itself, and access consciousness, which is the processing of the things in experience.<ref name=\"Bl\">Ned Block: ''On a Confusion about a Function of Consciousness'' in: ''The Behavioral and Brain Sciences'', 1995.</ref> Phenomenal consciousness is the state of being conscious, such as when they say \"I am conscious.\" Access consciousness is being conscious ''of'' something in relation to abstract concepts, such as when one says \"I am conscious of these words.\" Various forms of access consciousness include awareness, self-awareness, conscience, [[Stream of consciousness (psychology)|stream of consciousness]], [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Husserl's phenomenology]], and [[intentionality]]. The concept of phenomenal consciousness, in modern history, according to some, is closely related to the concept of [[qualia]]. [[Social psychology]] links sociology with psychology in their shared study of the nature and causes of human social interaction, with an emphasis on how people think towards each other and how they relate to each other. The behavior and mental processes, both human and non-human, can be described through [[animal cognition]], [[ethology]], [[evolutionary psychology]], and [[comparative psychology]] as well.

Furthermore, [[incentive]] and [[preference]] are both factors, as are any perceived links between incentives and preferences. [[Volition_(psychology)|Volition]] may also be involved, in which case willpower is also a factor. Ideally, both motivation and volition ensure the selection, striving for, and [[Realisation (metrology)|realization]] of goals in an optimal manner, a [[Function_(biology)|function]] beginning in childhood and continuing throughout a lifetime in a process known as [[socialization]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Heckhausen, J.|author2=Heckhausen, H.|author-link= |date=28 March 2018|title=Motivation and Action|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-65094-4_1|location=Introduction and Overview|publisher=Springer, Cham|page=1|isbn=978-3-319-65093-7|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-65094-4_1}}</ref>\n\nHappiness, or the state of being happy, is a human emotional condition. The definition of happiness is a common philosophical topic. Some people might define it as the best condition that a human can have\u2014a condition of [[mental health|mental]] and physical health. Others define it as [[wikt:freedom|freedom]] from want and [[suffering|distress]]; consciousness of the [[goodness and value theory|good]] order of things; assurance of one's place in the [[universe]] or society.\n\nEmotion has a significant influence on, or can even be said to control, human behavior, though historically many cultures and philosophers have for various reasons discouraged allowing this influence to go unchecked. Emotional experiences perceived as [[pleasure|pleasant]], such as love, [[admiration]], or [[joy]], contrast with those perceived as [[suffering|unpleasant]], like [[hate]], [[envy]], or [[sorrow (emotion)|sorrow]]. The [[Stoicism|Stoics]] believed excessive emotion was harmful, while some [[Sufi]] teachers felt certain extreme emotions could yield a conceptual perfection, what is often translated as [[ecstasy (emotion)|ecstasy]].\n\nIn modern scientific thought, certain refined emotions are considered a complex neural trait innate in a variety of [[domesticated animal|domesticated]] and non-domesticated [[mammal]]s. These were commonly developed in reaction to superior survival mechanisms and intelligent interaction with each other and the environment; as such, refined emotion is not in all cases as discrete and separate from natural neural function as was once assumed. However, when humans function in civilized tandem, it has been noted that uninhibited acting on extreme emotion can lead to social disorder and crime.\n\n===Sexuality and love===\n{{Main|Love|Human sexuality}}\n{{more citations needed|section|date=February 2020}}\n[[File:Sweet Baby Kisses Family Love.jpg|thumb|Human parents continue caring for their offspring long after they are born.]]\nFor humans, sexuality has important social functions: it creates physical intimacy, bonds and hierarchies among individuals, besides ensuring biological [[reproduction]]. Sexual desire, or ''[[libido]]'', is experienced as a bodily urge, often accompanied by strong emotions such as love, [[ecstasy (emotion)|ecstasy]] and [[jealousy]]. The significance of sexuality in the human species is reflected in a number of physical features, among them hidden [[ovulation]], the evolution of external [[scrotum]] and (among great apes) a relatively large [[human penis|penis]] suggesting [[human sperm competition|sperm competition in humans]], the absence of an [[Baculum|os penis]], permanent [[secondary sexual characteristics]] and the forming of [[pair bond]]s based on sexual attraction as a common social structure. Contrary to other primates that often advertise [[estrus]] through visible signs, human females do not have a distinct or visible signs of ovulation, plus they experience sexual desire outside of their fertile periods.\n\nHuman choices in acting on sexuality are commonly influenced by social norms which vary between cultures.

family-based social structures.]]\nHumans are highly social beings and tend to live in large complex social groups. More than any other creature, humans are capable of using systems of communication for self-expression, the exchange of ideas, and [[social organization|organization]], and as such have created complex [[social structures]] composed of many cooperating and competing groups. Human groups range from the size of families to nations. Social interactions between humans have established an extremely wide variety{{clarify|date=January 2014}} of values, social norms, and rituals, which together form the basis of human society.\n\nCulture is defined here as patterns of complex symbolic behavior, i.e. all behavior that is not innate but which has to be learned through social interaction with others; such as the use of distinctive [[material culture|material]] and [[symbolic system]]s, including language, ritual, social organization, traditions, beliefs and technology.\n\n===Language===\nWhile many species [[animal communication|communicate]], [[language]] is unique to humans, a defining feature of humanity, and a [[cultural universal]].

Human language also has the capacity of [[Displacement (linguistics)|displacement]], using words to represent things and happenings that are not presently or locally occurring, but reside in the shared imagination of interlocutors.<ref name=\"Revolution\"/> Language differs from other forms of communication in that it is [[Origin of speech#Modality-independence|modality independent]]; the same meanings can be conveyed through different media, auditively in speech, visually by sign language or writing, and even through tactile media such as [[braille]]. Language is central to the communication between humans, and to the sense of identity that unites nations, cultures and ethnic groups. The invention of writing systems at least five thousand years ago allowed the preservation of language on material objects, and was a major technological advancement. The science of [[linguistics]] describes the structure and function of language and the relationship between languages. There are approximately six thousand different languages currently in use, including [[sign language]]s, and many thousands more that are [[extinct language|extinct]].<ref name=Comrie1996>{{cite book |author1=Comrie, Bernard |author2=Polinsky, Maria |author3=Matthews, Stephen |title=The Atlas of Languages: The Origin and Development of Languages Throughout the World |year=1996 |publisher=Facts on File |location=New York City |pages=13\u201315 |isbn=978-0-8160-3388-1}}</ref>\n\n===Gender roles===\n{{Main|Gender role|Gender}}\nThe sexual division of humans into male, female, and in some societies other genders<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/content/two-spirits_map-html/ |title=A Map of Gender-Diverse Cultures &#124; Independent Lens |publisher=PBS |date=11 August 2015 |accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref> has been marked culturally by a corresponding division of roles, norms, [[practice (social theory)|practices]], dress, behavior, rights, [[duty|duties]], [[Privilege (social inequality)|privileges]], [[social status|status]], and [[power (philosophy)|power]]. [[Cultural identity|Cultural differences]] by gender have often been believed to have arisen naturally out of a division of reproductive labor; the biological fact that women give birth led to their further cultural responsibility for nurturing and caring for children. Gender roles have varied historically, and challenges to predominant gender norms have recurred in many societies.\n\n===Kinship===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\n{{main|Kinship|Marriage}}\n[[File:thedragonpainter.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sessue Hayakawa]] (left) with actress and wife [[Tsuru Aoki]] in a screen shot of the 1919 film ''[[The Dragon Painter]]''.]]\n\nAll human societies organize, recognize and classify types of social relationships based on relations between parents and children ([[consanguinity]]), and relations through marriage ([[Affinity (law)|affinity]]). These kinds of relations are generally called kinship relations. In most societies kinship places mutual responsibilities and expectations of solidarity on the individuals that are so related, and those who recognize each other as kinsmen come to form networks through which other social institutions can be regulated. Among the many functions of kinship is the ability to form [[descent group]]s, groups of people sharing a common line of descent, which can function as political units such as [[clan]]s. Another function is the way in which kinship unites families through marriage, forming [[Alliance theory|kinship alliances]] between groups of wife-takers and wife-givers. Such alliances also often have important political and economical ramifications, and may result in the formation of political organization above the community level. Kinship relations often includes regulations for whom an individual should or shouldn't marry. All societies have rules of [[incest taboo]], according to which marriage between certain kinds of kin relations are prohibited\u2014such rules vary widely between cultures.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Some societies also have rules of preferential marriage with certain kin relations, frequently with either [[Parallel and cross cousins|cross or parallel cousins]]. Rules and norms for marriage and social behavior among kinsfolk is often reflected in the systems of [[kinship terminology]] in the various languages of the world. In many societies kinship relations can also be formed through forms of co-habitation, adoption, fostering, or companionship, which also tends to create relations of enduring solidarity ([[nurture kinship]]).\n\n===Ethnicity===\n{{main|Ethnic group}}\nHumans often form ethnic groups, such groups tend to be larger than kinship networks and be organized around a common identity defined variously in terms of shared ancestry and history, shared cultural norms and language, or shared biological phenotype. Such ideologies of shared characteristics are often perpetuated in the form of powerful, compelling narratives that give legitimacy and continuity to the set of shared values. Ethnic groupings often correspond to some level of political organization such as the [[Band society|band]], [[tribe]], [[city state]] or nation. Although ethnic groups appear and disappear through history, members of ethnic groups often conceptualize their groups as having histories going back into the deep past. Such ideologies give ethnicity a powerful role in defining [[social identity]] and in constructing solidarity between members of an ethno-political unit. This unifying property of ethnicity has been closely tied to the rise of the [[nation state]] as the predominant form of political organization in the 19th and 20th centuries.<ref>J.

Within a society people can be divided into different groups according to their income, wealth, [[power (social and political)|power]], [[reputation]], etc., but the structure of [[social stratification]] and the degree of [[social mobility]] differs, especially between modern and traditional societies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.unitn.it/files/download/8481/srs_schizzerotto_social_stratification_2_as.pdf |title=Social Stratification |last=Schizzerotto |first=Antonio |publisher=[[University of Trento]] |access-date=3 July 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180320150018/http://web.unitn.it/files/download/8481/srs_schizzerotto_social_stratification_2_as.pdf |archivedate=20 March 2018  }}</ref> A state is an organized political community occupying a definite territory, having an organized government, and possessing internal and external [[sovereignty]]. Recognition of the state's claim to independence by other states, enabling it to enter into international agreements, is often important to the establishment of its statehood. The \"state\" can also be defined in terms of domestic conditions, specifically, as conceptualized by [[Max Weber]], \"a state is a human community that (successfully) claims the monopoly of the 'legitimate' use of physical force within a given territory.\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20020612070242/http://www.mdx.ac.uk/www/study/xWeb.htm Max Weber's definition of the modern state 1918], by [[Max Weber]], 1918. Retrieved 17 March 2006.</ref>\n\nGovernment can be defined as the political means of creating and enforcing laws; typically via a [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] [[hierarchy]]. Politics is the process by which decisions are made within groups; this process often involves conflict as well as compromise. Although the term is generally applied to behavior within governments, politics is also observed in all human group interactions, including corporate, academic, and religious institutions. Many different political systems exist, as do many different ways of understanding them, and many definitions overlap. Examples of governments include monarchy, [[Communist state]], [[military dictatorship]], [[theocracy]], and [[liberal democracy]], the last of which is considered dominant today. All of these issues have a direct relationship with economics.\n\n===Trade and economics===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\n{{Main|Trade|Economics}}\n[[File:Tengeru market.jpg|thumb|right|[[Buyer]]s and sellers [[bargaining]] in a market in [[Tengeru]], [[Tanzania]]]]\nTrade is the voluntary exchange of goods and services, and is a form of [[economic activity]]. A mechanism that allows trade is called a [[Market (economics)|market]]. Modern traders instead generally negotiate through a [[medium of exchange]], such as money. As a result, buying can be separated from selling, or [[earnings|earning]]. Because of specialization and [[division of labor]], most people concentrate on a small aspect of manufacturing or service, trading their labor for products. Trade exists between regions because different regions have an [[Absolute advantage|absolute]] or [[comparative advantage]] in the production of some tradable commodity, or because different regions' size allows for the benefits of [[mass production]].\n\nEconomics is a [[social science]] which studies the production, distribution, trade, and consumption of goods and services. Economics focuses on measurable variables, and is broadly divided into two main branches: [[microeconomics]], which deals with individual agents, such as households and businesses, and macroeconomics, which considers the economy as a whole, in which case it considers [[aggregate supply]] and [[aggregate demand|demand]] for money, [[capital (economics)|capital]] and [[commodity|commodities]]. Aspects receiving particular attention in economics are [[resource allocation]], production, distribution, trade, and competition. Economic logic is increasingly applied to any problem that involves choice under scarcity or determining economic [[Value (economics)|value]].\n\n===War===\n[[File:Bataille Waterloo 1815 reconstitution 2011 3.jpg|thumb|Men in period costume portraying soldiers during a 2011 reenactment of the [[Battle of Waterloo]] (1815)]]\n{{Main|War}}\nWar is a state of organized armed conflict between [[State (polity)|states]] or [[non-state actors]]. War is characterized by the use of lethal violence against others\u2014whether between [[combatants]] or upon [[non-combatants]]\u2014to achieve military goals through force. Lesser, often spontaneous conflicts, such as brawls, [[riots]], [[revolts]], and [[melees]], are not considered to be warfare. Revolutions can be [[Nonviolent revolution|nonviolent]] or an organized and armed revolution which denotes a state of war. During the 20th century, it is estimated that between 167 and 188 million people died as a result of war.<ref>Ferguson, Niall. \"The Next War of the World.\" Foreign Affairs, Sep/Oct 2006</ref> A common definition defines war as a series of [[military campaign]]s between at least two opposing sides involving a dispute over [[sovereignty]], territory, [[natural resource|resources]], religion, or other issues. A war between internal elements of a state is a [[civil war]].\n\nThere have been a wide variety of [[Revolution in Military Affairs|rapidly advancing]] [[military tactics|tactics]] throughout the history of war, ranging from [[conventional war]] to [[asymmetric warfare]] to [[total war]] and [[unconventional warfare]]. Techniques include [[hand to hand combat]], the use of [[ranged weapons]], [[naval warfare]], and, more recently, [[air support]]. Military intelligence has often played a key role in determining victory and defeat. Propaganda, which often includes information, slanted opinion and disinformation, plays a key role both in maintaining unity within a warring group and in sowing discord among opponents. In [[modern warfare]], soldiers and [[combat vehicle]]s are used to control the land, [[warships]] the sea, and aircraft the sky. These fields have also overlapped in the forms of [[marines]], [[paratroopers]], [[aircraft carriers]], and [[surface-to-air missiles]], among others. [[Satellites]] in [[low Earth orbit]] have made outer space a factor in warfare as well through their use for detailed intelligence gathering; however, no known aggressive actions have been [[space warfare|taken from space]].\n\n===Material culture and technology===\n{{Main|Tool|Technology}}\n[[File:N\u00e9olithique 0001.jpg|thumb|An array of [[Neolithic]] artifacts, including bracelets, axe heads, chisels, and polishing tools.]]\nStone tools were used by proto-humans at least 2.5&nbsp;million years ago.<ref name=Clark1994>{{cite journal |author1=Clark, J.D. |author2=de Heinzelin, J. |author3=Schick, K.D. |title=African ''Homo erectus'': old radiometric ages and young Oldowan assemblages in the Middle Awash Valley, Ethiopia |journal=Science |year=1994 |volume=264 |issue=5167 |pages=1907\u201310 |pmid=8009220 |doi=10.1126/science.8009220|display-authors=etal|bibcode=1994Sci...264.1907C }}</ref> The [[Control of fire by early humans|controlled use of fire]] began around 1.5&nbsp;million years ago.

It is the discipline searching for a general understanding of reality, reasoning and values. Major fields of philosophy include [[logic]], [[metaphysics]], [[epistemology]], [[philosophy of mind]], and [[axiology]] (which includes ethics and [[aesthetics]]). Philosophy covers a very wide range of approaches, and is used to refer to a [[worldview]], to a perspective on an issue, or to the positions argued for by a particular philosopher or school of philosophy.\n\n===Religion and spirituality===\n{{Main|Religion|Spirituality}}\n\nReligion is generally defined as a [[belief]] system concerning the [[supernatural]], [[sacred]] or [[divinity|divine]], and practices, [[values]], institutions and [[ritual]]s associated with such belief.

A common source for answers to these questions are beliefs in [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] divine beings such as [[deities]] or a singular God, although not all religions are [[theistic]]. Spirituality, belief or involvement in matters of the [[soul]] or [[spirit]], is one of the many different approaches humans take in trying to answer fundamental questions about humankind's place in the universe, the [[meaning of life]], and the ideal way to live one's life. Though these topics have also been addressed by philosophy, and to some extent by science, spirituality is unique in that it focuses on [[mystical]] or supernatural concepts such as [[karma]] and God.\n\nAlthough the exact level of religiosity can be hard to measure,<ref name=Hall2008>{{cite journal |author1=Hall, Daniel E. |author2=Meador, Keith G. |author3=Koenig, Harold G. |title=Measuring religiousness in health research: review and critique |journal=Journal of Religion and Health |volume=47 |issue=2 |pages=134\u201363 |year=2008 |pmid=19105008 |doi=10.1007/s10943-008-9165-2 |type=Submitted manuscript }}</ref> a majority of humans professes some variety of religious or spiritual belief, although many (in some countries a majority) are [[irreligious]].

Most religions and spiritual beliefs are clearly distinct from science on both a philosophical and methodological level; the two are not generally considered mutually exclusive and a majority of humans hold a mix of both scientific and religious views.

Another important physiological change related to sexuality in humans was the evolution of [[hidden estrus]]. Humans are the only ape in which the female is intermittently fertile year round, and in which no special signals of fertility are produced by the body (such as [[genital swelling]] during estrus). Nonetheless humans retain a degree of sexual dimorphism in the distribution of body hair and subcutaneous fat, and in the overall size, males being around 25% larger than females. These changes taken together have been interpreted as a result of an increased emphasis on [[pair bonding]] as a possible solution to the requirement for increased parental investment due to the prolonged infancy of offspring.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n===Rise of ''Homo sapiens''===\n[[File:Map-of-human-migrations.jpg|thumb|World map of early human migrations according to [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial]] [[population genetics]] (numbers are [[millennia]] before present, the North Pole is at the center).]]\n{{main|Homo sapiens}}\n{{see|Archaic human admixture with modern humans|Early human migrations|Multiregional origin of modern humans|Prehistoric autopsy|Recent African origin of modern humans}}\nBy the beginning of the [[Upper Paleolithic]] period (50,000 [[Before Present|BP]]), and likely significantly earlier by 100-70,000 years ago<ref name=\"McBrearty Brooks 2000\" /><ref name=\"Henshilwood Marean 2003\" /><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Henshilwood | first1 = C.

The comparatively minor anatomical differences between humans and [[Pan (genus)|chimpanzee]]s are largely a result of human [[bipedalism]] and larger brain size.

The construction of the [[human pelvis]] differs from other [[primate]]s, as do the toes. A trade-off for these advantages of the modern human pelvis is that childbirth is more difficult and dangerous than in most [[mammal]]s, especially given the larger head size of human [[babies]] compared to other primates. Human babies must turn around as they pass through the birth canal while other primates do not, which makes humans the only species where females usually require help from their [[conspecific]]s (other members of their own species) to reduce the risks of birthing. As a partial [[evolution]]ary solution, human fetuses are born [[Altricial|less developed and more vulnerable]]. Chimpanzee babies are cognitively more developed than human babies until the age of six months, when the rapid development of human brains surpasses chimpanzees. Another difference between women and chimpanzee females is that women go through the [[menopause]] and become [[Infertility|unfertile]] decades before the end of their lives. All species of non-human apes are capable of giving birth until death. Menopause probably developed as it provides an evolutionary advantage of more caring time to relatives' young.<ref name=\"O'Neil\"/>\n\nApart from bipedalism, humans differ from chimpanzees mostly in [[smelling]], [[hearing]], [[digesting]] [[protein]]s, [[brain size]], and the ability of [[language]]. Humans' brains are about three times bigger than in chimpanzees. More importantly, the brain to body ratio is much higher in humans than in chimpanzees, and humans have a significantly more developed [[cerebral cortex]], with a larger number of [[neurons]]. The mental abilities of humans are remarkable compared to other apes. Humans' ability of [[speech]] is unique among primates. Humans are able to create new and complex [[idea]]s, and to develop technology, which is unprecedented among other [[organism]]s on [[Earth]].<ref name=\"O'Neil\"/>\n\nIt is estimated that the worldwide average [[Human height|height for an adult human]] male is about {{Height|cm=172}},{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} while the worldwide average height for adult human females is about {{Height|cm=158}}.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Shrinkage of stature may begin in middle age in some individuals, but tends to be typical in the extremely [[Old age|aged]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Senior Citizens Do Shrink \u2013 Just One of the Body Changes of Aging |url=http://seniorjournal.com/NEWS/Aging/5-11-28-SeniorsDoShrink.htm |work=News |publisher=Senior Journal |accessdate=6 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130219004303/http://seniorjournal.com/NEWS/Aging/5-11-28-SeniorsDoShrink.htm |archivedate=19 February 2013 |df=}}</ref> Through history human populations have universally become taller, probably as a consequence of better nutrition, healthcare, and living conditions.<ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Bogin B, Rios L |title=Rapid morphological change in living humans: implications for modern human origins |journal=Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology A |volume=136 |issue=1 |pages=71\u201384 |date=September 2003 |pmid=14527631 |doi=10.1016/S1095-6433(02)00294-5}}</ref> The average [[Body weight|mass]] of an adult human is {{Convert|54|-|64|kg|lb|abbr=on|lk=off|0}} for females and {{Convert|70|-|83|kg|lb|abbr=on|lk=off|0}} for males.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.articleworld.org/index.php/Human_weight |title=Human weight |publisher=Articleworld.org |accessdate=10 December 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111208053451/http://articleworld.org/index.php/Human_weight |archivedate=8 December 2011  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/AlexSchlessingerman.shtml |title=Mass Of An Adult |publisher=The Physics Factbook: An Encyclopedia of Scientific Essays |accessdate=31 December 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180101030223/https://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/AlexSchlessingerman.shtml |archivedate=1 January 2018  }}</ref> Like many other conditions, body weight and body type is influenced by both genetic susceptibility and environment and varies greatly among individuals.

The genetic difference between sexes contributes to anatomical, hormonal, neural, and physiological differences between men and women, although the exact degree and nature of social and environmental influences on sexes are not completely understood.

Furthermore, different traits are non-concordant and each have different clinal distribution. Adaptability varies both from person to person and from population to population.

Humans are variously said to possess consciousness, [[self-awareness]], and a mind, which correspond roughly to the mental processes of [[thought]]. These are said to possess qualities such as self-awareness, [[sentience]], [[sapience]], and the ability to perceive the relationship between [[Personal identity|oneself]] and one's [[natural environment|environment]]. The extent to which the mind constructs or experiences the outer world is a matter of debate, as are the definitions and validity of many of the terms used above.\n\nThe physical aspects of the mind and brain, and by extension of the nervous system, are studied in the field of [[neurology]], the more behavioral in the field of psychology, and a sometimes loosely defined area between in the field of psychiatry, which treats mental illness and behavioral disorders. Psychology does not necessarily refer to the brain or nervous system, and can be framed purely in terms of [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenological]] or [[information processing]] theories of the mind. Increasingly, however, an understanding of brain functions is being included in psychological theory and practice, particularly in areas such as [[artificial intelligence]], [[neuropsychology]], and [[cognitive neuroscience]].\n\nThe nature of thought is central to psychology and related fields. [[Cognitive psychology]] studies [[cognition]], the [[mental function|mental processes']] underlying behavior. It uses [[information processing]] as a framework for understanding the mind. Perception, learning, problem solving, memory, attention, language and emotion are all well researched areas as well. Cognitive psychology is associated with a school of thought known as [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]], whose adherents argue for an [[information processing]] model of mental function, informed by [[positivism]] and [[experimental psychology]]. Techniques and models from cognitive psychology are widely applied and form the mainstay of psychological theories in many areas of both research and applied psychology. Largely focusing on the development of the human mind through the life span, [[developmental psychology]] seeks to understand how people come to perceive, understand, and act within the world and how these processes change as they age. This may focus on intellectual, cognitive, neural, social, or [[moral development]]. [[Psychologists]] have developed [[intelligence]] [[Test (assessment)|tests]] and the concept of [[intelligence quotient]] in order to assess the relative intelligence of human beings and study its [[Distribution (mathematics)|distribution]] among population.<ref>{{Britannica|289811|Intelligence test}}</ref>\n\nSome philosophers divide consciousness into phenomenal consciousness, which is experience itself, and access consciousness, which is the processing of the things in experience.<ref name=\"Bl\">Ned Block: ''On a Confusion about a Function of Consciousness'' in: ''The Behavioral and Brain Sciences'', 1995.</ref> Phenomenal consciousness is the state of being conscious, such as when they say \"I am conscious.\" Access consciousness is being conscious ''of'' something in relation to abstract concepts, such as when one says \"I am conscious of these words.\" Various forms of access consciousness include awareness, self-awareness, conscience, [[Stream of consciousness (psychology)|stream of consciousness]], [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Husserl's phenomenology]], and [[intentionality]]. The concept of phenomenal consciousness, in modern history, according to some, is closely related to the concept of [[qualia]]. [[Social psychology]] links sociology with psychology in their shared study of the nature and causes of human social interaction, with an emphasis on how people think towards each other and how they relate to each other. The behavior and mental processes, both human and non-human, can be described through [[animal cognition]], [[ethology]], [[evolutionary psychology]], and [[comparative psychology]] as well. [[Human ecology]] is an [[List of academic disciplines|academic discipline]] that investigates how humans and human societies interact with both their natural environment and the human [[social environment]].\n\n===Motivation and emotion===\n{{More citations needed|section|date=January 2020}}\n{{Main|Motivation|Emotion}}\n[[File:Plate depicting emotions of grief from Charles Darwin's book The Expression of the Emotions.jpg|right|thumb|Illustration of grief from [[Charles Darwin]]'s book ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]''.]]\n\nHuman motivation is not yet wholly understood. From a psychological perspective, [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]] is a well-established theory which can be defined as the process of satisfying certain needs in ascending order of complexity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html|title=Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs|author=Saul McLeod|date=20 March 2020|website=Simplypsychology.org|publisher=Simply Scholar Limited|access-date=4 April 2020|quote=Maslow's hierarchy of needs is a motivational theory in psychology comprising a five-tier model of human needs, often depicted as hierarchical levels within a pyramid.

Furthermore, [[incentive]] and [[preference]] are both factors, as are any perceived links between incentives and preferences. [[Volition_(psychology)|Volition]] may also be involved, in which case willpower is also a factor. Ideally, both motivation and volition ensure the selection, striving for, and [[Realisation (metrology)|realization]] of goals in an optimal manner, a [[Function_(biology)|function]] beginning in childhood and continuing throughout a lifetime in a process known as [[socialization]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Heckhausen, J.|author2=Heckhausen, H.|author-link= |date=28 March 2018|title=Motivation and Action|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-65094-4_1|location=Introduction and Overview|publisher=Springer, Cham|page=1|isbn=978-3-319-65093-7|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-65094-4_1}}</ref>\n\nHappiness, or the state of being happy, is a human emotional condition. The definition of happiness is a common philosophical topic. Some people might define it as the best condition that a human can have\u2014a condition of [[mental health|mental]] and physical health. Others define it as [[wikt:freedom|freedom]] from want and [[suffering|distress]]; consciousness of the [[goodness and value theory|good]] order of things; assurance of one's place in the [[universe]] or society.\n\nEmotion has a significant influence on, or can even be said to control, human behavior, though historically many cultures and philosophers have for various reasons discouraged allowing this influence to go unchecked. Emotional experiences perceived as [[pleasure|pleasant]], such as love, [[admiration]], or [[joy]], contrast with those perceived as [[suffering|unpleasant]], like [[hate]], [[envy]], or [[sorrow (emotion)|sorrow]]. The [[Stoicism|Stoics]] believed excessive emotion was harmful, while some [[Sufi]] teachers felt certain extreme emotions could yield a conceptual perfection, what is often translated as [[ecstasy (emotion)|ecstasy]].\n\nIn modern scientific thought, certain refined emotions are considered a complex neural trait innate in a variety of [[domesticated animal|domesticated]] and non-domesticated [[mammal]]s. These were commonly developed in reaction to superior survival mechanisms and intelligent interaction with each other and the environment; as such, refined emotion is not in all cases as discrete and separate from natural neural function as was once assumed. However, when humans function in civilized tandem, it has been noted that uninhibited acting on extreme emotion can lead to social disorder and crime.\n\n===Sexuality and love===\n{{Main|Love|Human sexuality}}\n{{more citations needed|section|date=February 2020}}\n[[File:Sweet Baby Kisses Family Love.jpg|thumb|Human parents continue caring for their offspring long after they are born.]]\nFor humans, sexuality has important social functions: it creates physical intimacy, bonds and hierarchies among individuals, besides ensuring biological [[reproduction]]. Sexual desire, or ''[[libido]]'', is experienced as a bodily urge, often accompanied by strong emotions such as love, [[ecstasy (emotion)|ecstasy]] and [[jealousy]]. The significance of sexuality in the human species is reflected in a number of physical features, among them hidden [[ovulation]], the evolution of external [[scrotum]] and (among great apes) a relatively large [[human penis|penis]] suggesting [[human sperm competition|sperm competition in humans]], the absence of an [[Baculum|os penis]], permanent [[secondary sexual characteristics]] and the forming of [[pair bond]]s based on sexual attraction as a common social structure. Contrary to other primates that often advertise [[estrus]] through visible signs, human females do not have a distinct or visible signs of ovulation, plus they experience sexual desire outside of their fertile periods.\n\nHuman choices in acting on sexuality are commonly influenced by social norms which vary between cultures.

Among the many functions of kinship is the ability to form [[descent group]]s, groups of people sharing a common line of descent, which can function as political units such as [[clan]]s. Another function is the way in which kinship unites families through marriage, forming [[Alliance theory|kinship alliances]] between groups of wife-takers and wife-givers. Such alliances also often have important political and economical ramifications, and may result in the formation of political organization above the community level. Kinship relations often includes regulations for whom an individual should or shouldn't marry. All societies have rules of [[incest taboo]], according to which marriage between certain kinds of kin relations are prohibited\u2014such rules vary widely between cultures.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Some societies also have rules of preferential marriage with certain kin relations, frequently with either [[Parallel and cross cousins|cross or parallel cousins]]. Rules and norms for marriage and social behavior among kinsfolk is often reflected in the systems of [[kinship terminology]] in the various languages of the world. In many societies kinship relations can also be formed through forms of co-habitation, adoption, fostering, or companionship, which also tends to create relations of enduring solidarity ([[nurture kinship]]).\n\n===Ethnicity===\n{{main|Ethnic group}}\nHumans often form ethnic groups, such groups tend to be larger than kinship networks and be organized around a common identity defined variously in terms of shared ancestry and history, shared cultural norms and language, or shared biological phenotype. Such ideologies of shared characteristics are often perpetuated in the form of powerful, compelling narratives that give legitimacy and continuity to the set of shared values. Ethnic groupings often correspond to some level of political organization such as the [[Band society|band]], [[tribe]], [[city state]] or nation. Although ethnic groups appear and disappear through history, members of ethnic groups often conceptualize their groups as having histories going back into the deep past. Such ideologies give ethnicity a powerful role in defining [[social identity]] and in constructing solidarity between members of an ethno-political unit. This unifying property of ethnicity has been closely tied to the rise of the [[nation state]] as the predominant form of political organization in the 19th and 20th centuries.<ref>J.

Within a society people can be divided into different groups according to their income, wealth, [[power (social and political)|power]], [[reputation]], etc., but the structure of [[social stratification]] and the degree of [[social mobility]] differs, especially between modern and traditional societies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.unitn.it/files/download/8481/srs_schizzerotto_social_stratification_2_as.pdf |title=Social Stratification |last=Schizzerotto |first=Antonio |publisher=[[University of Trento]] |access-date=3 July 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180320150018/http://web.unitn.it/files/download/8481/srs_schizzerotto_social_stratification_2_as.pdf |archivedate=20 March 2018  }}</ref> A state is an organized political community occupying a definite territory, having an organized government, and possessing internal and external [[sovereignty]]. Recognition of the state's claim to independence by other states, enabling it to enter into international agreements, is often important to the establishment of its statehood. The \"state\" can also be defined in terms of domestic conditions, specifically, as conceptualized by [[Max Weber]], \"a state is a human community that (successfully) claims the monopoly of the 'legitimate' use of physical force within a given territory.\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20020612070242/http://www.mdx.ac.uk/www/study/xWeb.htm Max Weber's definition of the modern state 1918], by [[Max Weber]], 1918. Retrieved 17 March 2006.</ref>\n\nGovernment can be defined as the political means of creating and enforcing laws; typically via a [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] [[hierarchy]]. Politics is the process by which decisions are made within groups; this process often involves conflict as well as compromise. Although the term is generally applied to behavior within governments, politics is also observed in all human group interactions, including corporate, academic, and religious institutions. Many different political systems exist, as do many different ways of understanding them, and many definitions overlap. Examples of governments include monarchy, [[Communist state]], [[military dictatorship]], [[theocracy]], and [[liberal democracy]], the last of which is considered dominant today. All of these issues have a direct relationship with economics.\n\n===Trade and economics===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\n{{Main|Trade|Economics}}\n[[File:Tengeru market.jpg|thumb|right|[[Buyer]]s and sellers [[bargaining]] in a market in [[Tengeru]], [[Tanzania]]]]\nTrade is the voluntary exchange of goods and services, and is a form of [[economic activity]]. A mechanism that allows trade is called a [[Market (economics)|market]]. Modern traders instead generally negotiate through a [[medium of exchange]], such as money. As a result, buying can be separated from selling, or [[earnings|earning]]. Because of specialization and [[division of labor]], most people concentrate on a small aspect of manufacturing or service, trading their labor for products. Trade exists between regions because different regions have an [[Absolute advantage|absolute]] or [[comparative advantage]] in the production of some tradable commodity, or because different regions' size allows for the benefits of [[mass production]].\n\nEconomics is a [[social science]] which studies the production, distribution, trade, and consumption of goods and services. Economics focuses on measurable variables, and is broadly divided into two main branches: [[microeconomics]], which deals with individual agents, such as households and businesses, and macroeconomics, which considers the economy as a whole, in which case it considers [[aggregate supply]] and [[aggregate demand|demand]] for money, [[capital (economics)|capital]] and [[commodity|commodities]]. Aspects receiving particular attention in economics are [[resource allocation]], production, distribution, trade, and competition. Economic logic is increasingly applied to any problem that involves choice under scarcity or determining economic [[Value (economics)|value]].\n\n===War===\n[[File:Bataille Waterloo 1815 reconstitution 2011 3.jpg|thumb|Men in period costume portraying soldiers during a 2011 reenactment of the [[Battle of Waterloo]] (1815)]]\n{{Main|War}}\nWar is a state of organized armed conflict between [[State (polity)|states]] or [[non-state actors]]. War is characterized by the use of lethal violence against others\u2014whether between [[combatants]] or upon [[non-combatants]]\u2014to achieve military goals through force. Lesser, often spontaneous conflicts, such as brawls, [[riots]], [[revolts]], and [[melees]], are not considered to be warfare. Revolutions can be [[Nonviolent revolution|nonviolent]] or an organized and armed revolution which denotes a state of war. During the 20th century, it is estimated that between 167 and 188 million people died as a result of war.<ref>Ferguson, Niall. \"The Next War of the World.\" Foreign Affairs, Sep/Oct 2006</ref> A common definition defines war as a series of [[military campaign]]s between at least two opposing sides involving a dispute over [[sovereignty]], territory, [[natural resource|resources]], religion, or other issues. A war between internal elements of a state is a [[civil war]].\n\nThere have been a wide variety of [[Revolution in Military Affairs|rapidly advancing]] [[military tactics|tactics]] throughout the history of war, ranging from [[conventional war]] to [[asymmetric warfare]] to [[total war]] and [[unconventional warfare]]. Techniques include [[hand to hand combat]], the use of [[ranged weapons]], [[naval warfare]], and, more recently, [[air support]]. Military intelligence has often played a key role in determining victory and defeat. Propaganda, which often includes information, slanted opinion and disinformation, plays a key role both in maintaining unity within a warring group and in sowing discord among opponents. In [[modern warfare]], soldiers and [[combat vehicle]]s are used to control the land, [[warships]] the sea, and aircraft the sky. These fields have also overlapped in the forms of [[marines]], [[paratroopers]], [[aircraft carriers]], and [[surface-to-air missiles]], among others. [[Satellites]] in [[low Earth orbit]] have made outer space a factor in warfare as well through their use for detailed intelligence gathering; however, no known aggressive actions have been [[space warfare|taken from space]].\n\n===Material culture and technology===\n{{Main|Tool|Technology}}\n[[File:N\u00e9olithique 0001.jpg|thumb|An array of [[Neolithic]] artifacts, including bracelets, axe heads, chisels, and polishing tools.]]\nStone tools were used by proto-humans at least 2.5&nbsp;million years ago.<ref name=Clark1994>{{cite journal |author1=Clark, J.D. |author2=de Heinzelin, J. |author3=Schick, K.D. |title=African ''Homo erectus'': old radiometric ages and young Oldowan assemblages in the Middle Awash Valley, Ethiopia |journal=Science |year=1994 |volume=264 |issue=5167 |pages=1907\u201310 |pmid=8009220 |doi=10.1126/science.8009220|display-authors=etal|bibcode=1994Sci...264.1907C }}</ref> The [[Control of fire by early humans|controlled use of fire]] began around 1.5&nbsp;million years ago.

It is the discipline searching for a general understanding of reality, reasoning and values. Major fields of philosophy include [[logic]], [[metaphysics]], [[epistemology]], [[philosophy of mind]], and [[axiology]] (which includes ethics and [[aesthetics]]). Philosophy covers a very wide range of approaches, and is used to refer to a [[worldview]], to a perspective on an issue, or to the positions argued for by a particular philosopher or school of philosophy.\n\n===Religion and spirituality===\n{{Main|Religion|Spirituality}}\n\nReligion is generally defined as a [[belief]] system concerning the [[supernatural]], [[sacred]] or [[divinity|divine]], and practices, [[values]], institutions and [[ritual]]s associated with such belief. Some religions also have a [[moral code]]. The [[Evolutionary psychology of religion|evolution]] and the history of the [[Evolutionary origin of religions|first religions]] have recently become areas of active scientific investigation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://evolution.binghamton.edu/religion/ |title=Evolutionary Religious Studies: A New Field of Scientific Inquiry |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090817171221/http://evolution.binghamton.edu/religion/ |archivedate=17 August 2009  }}</ref><ref name=Boyer2008>{{cite journal |author=Boyer, Pascal |title=Being human: Religion: bound to believe? |journal=Nature |volume=455 |issue=7216 |pages=1038\u201339 |year=2008 |pmid=18948934 |doi=10.1038/4551038a|bibcode=2008Natur.455.1038B }}</ref><ref name=Emmons2003>{{Cite journal |author1=Emmons, Robert A. |author2=Paloutzian, Raymond F. |title=The psychology of religion |journal=Annual Review of Psychology |year=2003 |pmid=12171998 |volume=54 |issue=1 |pages=377\u2013402 |doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.54.101601.145024}}</ref> However, in the course of its [[development of religion|development]], religion has taken on many forms that vary by culture and individual perspective. Some of the chief questions and issues religions are concerned with include life after death (commonly involving belief in an [[afterlife]]), the [[origin of life]], the nature of the [[universe]] ([[religious cosmology]]) and its [[ultimate fate]] ([[eschatology]]), and what is [[morality|moral]] or immoral. A common source for answers to these questions are beliefs in [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] divine beings such as [[deities]] or a singular God, although not all religions are [[theistic]]. Spirituality, belief or involvement in matters of the [[soul]] or [[spirit]], is one of the many different approaches humans take in trying to answer fundamental questions about humankind's place in the universe, the [[meaning of life]], and the ideal way to live one's life. Though these topics have also been addressed by philosophy, and to some extent by science, spirituality is unique in that it focuses on [[mystical]] or supernatural concepts such as [[karma]] and God.\n\nAlthough the exact level of religiosity can be hard to measure,<ref name=Hall2008>{{cite journal |author1=Hall, Daniel E. |author2=Meador, Keith G. |author3=Koenig, Harold G. |title=Measuring religiousness in health research: review and critique |journal=Journal of Religion and Health |volume=47 |issue=2 |pages=134\u201363 |year=2008 |pmid=19105008 |doi=10.1007/s10943-008-9165-2 |type=Submitted manuscript }}</ref> a majority of humans professes some variety of religious or spiritual belief, although many (in some countries a majority) are [[irreligious]]. This includes humans who have no religious beliefs or do not identify with any religion. [[Humanism]] is a philosophy which seeks to include all of humanity and all issues common to humans; it is usually non-religious. Most religions and spiritual beliefs are clearly distinct from science on both a philosophical and methodological level; the two are not generally considered mutually exclusive and a majority of humans hold a mix of both scientific and religious views. The distinction between philosophy and religion, on the other hand, is at times less clear, and the two are linked in such fields as the [[philosophy of religion]] and theology.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Art, music, and literature===\n{{Main|Art|Music|Literature}}\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2018}}\n[[File:Lorenzo Lippi 001.jpg|thumb|upright|''Allegory of Music'' ({{circa}} 1594), a painting of a woman writing [[sheet music]] by [[Lorenzo Lippi]]]]\n\nHumans have been producing [[art]] works for at least seventy-three thousand years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/12/science/oldest-drawing-ever-found.html|title=Oldest Known Drawing by Human Hands Discovered in South African Cave|last=St. Fleur|first=Nicholas|date=12 September 2018|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=20 September 2018}}</ref> Art may be defined as a form of [[culture|cultural]] expression and the usage of narratives of liberation and exploration (i.e. [[art history]], [[art criticism]], and [[art theory]]) to mediate its boundaries.
