The term \"[[normal school]]\" is based on the French ''\u00e9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure'', a school to educate teachers. Consistent with education tradition of the times, the Lyndon Training Course expanded its curriculum in one-year increments, and the first two-year class graduated in 1923. In 1927, Rita Bole became principal of the school. The first three-year class, consisting of nine students, graduated in 1934. In 1944, the state allowed Lyndon to grant four-year degrees so long as it remained a teacher training institution. The first four-year degrees were granted to 18 students in 1944. It was during these years that the [[Northeast Kingdom]] began to depend on Lyndon to address the educational needs of its residents.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nBole, who led the school until 1955, encouraged the Vermont State Legislature to establish Lyndon Teachers College, saw the admission of the first male and first out-of-state students during the 1940s, and oversaw the move to the [[Theodore Newton Vail]] estate. Vail was the first president of the American Telephone & Telegraph Company (AT&T).  Vail had been instrumental in the establishment of Lyndon Institute, and Bole recognized his vacant estate as the perfect place to house the growing school. The move to Vail Manor was completed on June 30, 1951, the final day of the school's lease at Lyndon Institute.\n\nIn 1961, the State Legislature established the [[Vermont State Colleges]] system, a consortium of Vermont's five public colleges governed by a common board of trustees, chancellor and [[Council of Presidents]] and Lyndon Teachers College became Lyndon State College. This marked the beginning of a period of rapid growth and, in 1964, the campus began to expand. A library, a dormitory, a dining hall, a science wing, a gymnasium, and a theater were built. These additions began meeting the needs of a growing student population that also brought a rapid expansion of the Lyndon curriculum.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} In the 1970s, new majors were developed in business administration, special education, recreations, meteorology, communications, human services, and physical education. It was also during this decade that the original Vail Manor was deemed unsafe and was replaced with the Theodore N. Vail Center that now houses the Vail Museum and preserves the name that has become an integral part of the Lyndon State tradition.<ref>Lyndon State College Undergraduate Catalog, 2007-2008, p.4</ref>\n\nIn 2005, a new residence hall was constructed near Wheelock Hall. The building was named The Rita L. Bole Complex, after the principal of Lyndon Normal School.\n\nIn 2009, the Academic and Student Activity Center, a [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]]-certified, or \"green\" building, was constructed to house Lyndon's Business, Exercise Science and Meteorology majors. It also contains computer labs, classrooms and a student event center.\n\nIn September 2016, the VSC board of trustees voted to merge Lyndon State College with [[Johnson State College]], located roughly 50 miles away.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sevendaysvt.com/vermont/shotgun-marriage-johnson-and-lyndon-state-colleges-rush-to-the-altar/Content?oid=3669084|title=Shotgun Marriage?

It also contains the bookstore, student center, and snack bar. The science wing contains classrooms and laboratories. There is a television wing for the television studies and is home to News 7, LSC's daily live broadcast facility. It also contains the small [[Alexander Twilight]] Theater. It is connected to the Library and Academic Center (LAC).\n\nLAC contains classrooms, a 24-hour computer lab, and the three-floor [[Samuel Read Hall Library]].\n\nThe Harvey Academic Center is located at the center of campus, and houses offices and classrooms for Recreation Studies, as well as for other classes.\n\nThe center of campus was centered around a small pond until the summer of 2019. It was filled in and made into a park. There is a large pond across from the library. Adjacent to the park is the Steven's Dining Hall\n\nAdjacent to the theater is the Stannard Gymnasium. The smaller gym, known as the Rita Bole Gymnasium (There is also a Rita Bole residence hall.) is used for basketball games, floor hockey, and a wide variety of intramural sports. In this complex is a {{convert|25|m}} swimming pool, racquetball court, rock climbing wall and a fitness center.<ref>[http://community.lyndonstate.edu/Athletics/Facilities/tabid/730/Default.aspx Lyndon State College Hornets: Facilities]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nOn the north side of the campus, across from the baseball fields is the Brown House containing a dispensary.

Lyndon State College was accredited by the [[New England Association of Schools and Colleges]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gateway.lsc.vsc.edu/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100607091729/http://gateway.lsc.vsc.edu/ |archivedate=2010-06-07 }}</ref> On July 1, 2018, [[Johnson State College]] and Lyndon State College formally merged, creating [[Northern Vermont University]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jsc.edu/who-we-are/northern-vermont-university|title=Northern Vermont University - Johnson - Johnson State College|website=www.jsc.edu|access-date=2017-09-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180706175825/http://www.jsc.edu/who-we-are/northern-vermont-university|archive-date=2018-07-06|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn 1911, the college was founded as a one-year normal school housed in rented space in nearby [[Lyndon Institute]]. The term \"[[normal school]]\" is based on the French ''\u00e9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure'', a school to educate teachers. Consistent with education tradition of the times, the Lyndon Training Course expanded its curriculum in one-year increments, and the first two-year class graduated in 1923. In 1927, Rita Bole became principal of the school. The first three-year class, consisting of nine students, graduated in 1934. In 1944, the state allowed Lyndon to grant four-year degrees so long as it remained a teacher training institution. The first four-year degrees were granted to 18 students in 1944. It was during these years that the [[Northeast Kingdom]] began to depend on Lyndon to address the educational needs of its residents.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nBole, who led the school until 1955, encouraged the Vermont State Legislature to establish Lyndon Teachers College, saw the admission of the first male and first out-of-state students during the 1940s, and oversaw the move to the [[Theodore Newton Vail]] estate. Vail was the first president of the American Telephone & Telegraph Company (AT&T).  Vail had been instrumental in the establishment of Lyndon Institute, and Bole recognized his vacant estate as the perfect place to house the growing school. The move to Vail Manor was completed on June 30, 1951, the final day of the school's lease at Lyndon Institute.\n\nIn 1961, the State Legislature established the [[Vermont State Colleges]] system, a consortium of Vermont's five public colleges governed by a common board of trustees, chancellor and [[Council of Presidents]] and Lyndon Teachers College became Lyndon State College. This marked the beginning of a period of rapid growth and, in 1964, the campus began to expand. A library, a dormitory, a dining hall, a science wing, a gymnasium, and a theater were built. These additions began meeting the needs of a growing student population that also brought a rapid expansion of the Lyndon curriculum.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} In the 1970s, new majors were developed in business administration, special education, recreations, meteorology, communications, human services, and physical education. It was also during this decade that the original Vail Manor was deemed unsafe and was replaced with the Theodore N. Vail Center that now houses the Vail Museum and preserves the name that has become an integral part of the Lyndon State tradition.<ref>Lyndon State College Undergraduate Catalog, 2007-2008, p.4</ref>\n\nIn 2005, a new residence hall was constructed near Wheelock Hall. The building was named The Rita L. Bole Complex, after the principal of Lyndon Normal School.\n\nIn 2009, the Academic and Student Activity Center, a [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]]-certified, or \"green\" building, was constructed to house Lyndon's Business, Exercise Science and Meteorology majors. It also contains computer labs, classrooms and a student event center.\n\nIn September 2016, the VSC board of trustees voted to merge Lyndon State College with [[Johnson State College]], located roughly 50 miles away.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sevendaysvt.com/vermont/shotgun-marriage-johnson-and-lyndon-state-colleges-rush-to-the-altar/Content?oid=3669084|title=Shotgun Marriage?

It was filled in and made into a park. There is a large pond across from the library. Adjacent to the park is the Steven's Dining Hall\n\nAdjacent to the theater is the Stannard Gymnasium. The smaller gym, known as the Rita Bole Gymnasium (There is also a Rita Bole residence hall.) is used for basketball games, floor hockey, and a wide variety of intramural sports.

Many of these Germans had served in government, the military, or in civil positions, which enabled them to engage in [[subversion]] and conspiracy; in addition, the Canadian historian Peter Hoffman counts unspecified \"tens of thousands\" in [[Nazi concentration camps]] who were either suspected of or actually engaged in opposition.<ref>Peter Hoffmann \"The History of the German Resistance, 1933&ndash;1945\"p.xiii</ref> By contrast, the German historian [[Hans Mommsen]] wrote that resistance in Germany was \"resistance without the people\" and that the number of those Germans engaged in resistance to the Nazi regime was very small.<ref>Mommsen, Hans \"German Society and the Resistance Against Hitler\" pages 255-273 from ''The Third Reich The Essential Readings'' edited by Christian Leitz, Blackwell: London, 1999 pages 259-262.</ref>  The resistance in Germany included German citizens of non-German ethnicity, such as members of the Polish minority who formed resistance groups like [[Olimp (organization)|Olimp]].<ref>{{citation | url=http://wroclaw.gazeta.pl/wroclaw/1,35771,4203914.html | title=Ho\u0142d dla polskich patriot\u00f3w z Breslau | work=Gazeta Wroclaw| first=Beata | last= Maciejewska | date= 5 June 2007 | accessdate=14 July 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Introduction==\nThe German opposition and resistance movements consisted of disparate political and ideological strands, which represented different classes of German society and were seldom able to work together \u2013 indeed for much of the period there was little or no contact between the different strands of resistance.

Their stance was symbolically significant. The churches, as institutions, did not openly advocate for the overthrow of the Nazi state, but they remained one of the very few German institutions to retain some independence from the state, and were thus able to continue to co-ordinate a level of opposition to Government policies. They resisted the regime's efforts to intrude on ecclesiastical autonomy, but from the beginning, a minority of clergymen expressed broader reservations about the new order, and gradually their criticisms came to form a \"coherent, systematic critique of many of the teachings of National Socialism\".<ref name=\"Theodore S.

These were the special focus of the Gestapo. Because their common goal - the overthrow of the Nazi regime, the re-establishment of an independent Austria under Habsburg leadership - was a special provocation for the Nazi regime. Especially because Hitler bristled with hatred of the Habsburg family. Hitler diametrically rejected the centuries-old Habsburg principles of \"live and let live\" with regard to ethnic groups, peoples, minorities, religions, cultures and languages.<ref>Timothy Snyder \"The Red Prince: The Secret Lives of a Habsburg Archduke\" (2008).</ref><ref>James Longo \"Hitler and the Habsburgs: The Fuhrer's Vendetta Against the Austrian Royals\" (2018).</ref><ref>Bob Carruthers \"Hitler's Violent Youth: How Trench Warfare and Street Fighting Moulded Hitler\" (2015).</ref><ref>On Habsburg and the diversity of religions: Pieter M.

As a unique attempt in the German Reich to act aggressively against the Nazi state or the Gestapo, their plans regarding the later executed [[Karl Burian]] to blow up the Gestapo headquarters in Vienna apply. The Catholic resistance group, led by [[Heinrich Maier]], wanted to revive a Habsburg monarchy after the war on the one hand, and very successfully passed on plans and production sites for [[V-2 rocket]]s, [[Tiger tank]]s and aircraft to the Allies. From the fall of 1943 at least, these transmissions informed the Allies about the exact site plans of German production plants. With the location sketches of the manufacturing facilities, the Allied bombers were given precise air strikes. In contrast to many other German resistance groups, the Maier Group informed very early about the mass murder of Jews through their contacts with the Semperit factory near Auschwitz - a message the Americans in Zurich initially did not believe in the scope of.<ref>Elisabeth Boeckl-Klamper, Thomas Mang, Wolfgang Neugebauer: ''Gestapo-Leitstelle Wien 1938\u20131945.''

For example, in a Volksgerichtshof trial in Vienna, an old, seriously ill and frail woman was sentenced to 4 years in prison for possessing a self-written note found in her wallet with the rhymed text \"Wir wollen einen Kaiser von Gottesgnaden und keinen Blutm\u00f6rder aus Berchtesgaden.

This organized regular demonstrations and marches and published weekly publications. In the USA there were also the \u201cAustrian American League\u201d as pro-Habsburg organizations. [[Otto von Habsburg]] strongly opposed the Nazi regime. On the one hand, Habsburg provided thousands of refugees with the rescue visas and, on the other, made politics for the peoples of Central Europe with the Allies.

More than 300 Germans have been recognised for this.<ref>Martin Gilbert, ''The Righteous: The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust'', 181</ref> It also included, particularly in the later years of the regime, informal networks of young Germans who evaded serving in the [[Hitler Youth]] and defied the cultural policies of the Nazis in various ways.\n\nThe German Army, the Foreign Office and the ''[[Abwehr]]'', the military intelligence organization became sources for plots against Hitler in 1938 and again in 1939, but for a variety of reasons could not implement their plans. After the German defeat in the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] in 1943, they contacted many army officers who were convinced that Hitler was leading Germany to disaster, although fewer who were willing to engage in overt resistance. Active resisters in this group were frequently drawn from members of the [[Prussia]]n aristocracy.\n\nAlmost every community in Germany had members taken away to concentration camps. As early as 1935 there were jingles warning:\n\"Dear Lord God, keep me quiet, so that I don't end up in Dachau.\" (It almost rhymes in German:  ''Lieber Herr Gott mach mich stumm / Da\u00df ich nicht nach Dachau komm.'')<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=2770938|title=German Reactions to Nazi Atrocities|first=Morris|last=Janowitz|date=1 January 1946|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=52|issue=2|pages=141\u2013146|doi=10.1086/219961|pmid=20994277|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/03085c6d94f9a4128e99caa88b65556e14a172e3}}</ref>  \"Dachau\" refers to the [[Dachau concentration camp]].

The failures of the [[Weimar Republic]] had discredited democracy in the eyes of most Germans. Hitler's apparent success in restoring full employment after the ravages of the [[Great Depression]] (achieved mainly through the reintroduction of [[conscription]], a policy advocating that women stay home and raise children, a crash re-armament programme, and the incremental removal of Jews from the workforce as their jobs were tendered to Gentiles), and his bloodless foreign policy successes such as the [[reoccupation of the Rhineland]] in 1936 and the [[annexation of Austria]] in 1938, brought him almost universal acclaim.<ref name=shirer/>\n\nDuring this period, the SPD and the KPD managed to maintain underground networks, although the legacy of pre-1933 conflicts between the two parties meant that they were unable to co-operate. The [[Gestapo]] frequently infiltrated these networks, and the rate of arrests and executions of SPD and KPD activists was high, but the networks continued to be able recruit new members from the industrial working class, who resented the stringent labour discipline imposed by the regime during its race to rearm. The [[Sopade|exiled SPD leadership]] in [[Prague]] received and published accurate reports of events inside Germany. But beyond maintaining their existence and fomenting industrial unrest, sometimes resulting in short-lived strikes, these networks were able to achieve little.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=u5XzVzhiptQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=KPD+resistance+nazi#v=onepage&q=KPD%20resistance%20nazi&f=false|title=Circles of Resistance: Jewish, Leftist, and Youth Dissidence in Nazi Germany|last=Cox|first=John M.|date=2009|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=9781433105579|location=|pages=33\u201336|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThere remained, however, a substantial base for opposition to Hitler's regime. Although the Nazi Party had taken control of the German state, it had not destroyed and rebuilt the state apparatus in the way the [[Bolshevik]] regime had done in the [[Soviet Union]]. Institutions such as the Foreign Office, the intelligence services and, above all, the army, retained some measure of independence, while outwardly submitting to the new regime. In May 1934, Colonel-General [[Ludwig Beck]], Chief of Staff of the Army, had offered to resign if preparations were made for an offensive war against Czechoslovakia.<ref>''History of the German Resistance, 1933-1945'', Peter Hoffman, pg 38</ref> The independence of the army was eroded in 1938, when both the War Minister, General [[Werner von Blomberg]], and the Army Chief, General [[Werner von Fritsch]], were removed from office, but an informal network of officers critical of the Nazi regime remained.<ref name=\"shirer\" />\n\nIn 1936, thanks to an informer, the Gestapo raids devastated [[anarcho-syndicalism|Anarcho-syndicalist]] groups all over Germany, resulting in the arrest of 89 people.

The groups had been encouraging strikes, printing and distributing anti-Nazi propaganda and recruiting people to fight the Nazis' fascist allies during the [[Spanish Civil War]].<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nAs part of the agreement with the conservative forces by which Hitler became chancellor in 1933, the non-party conservative [[Konstantin von Neurath]] remained foreign minister, a position he retained until 1938. During Neurath's time in control, the Foreign Office with its network of diplomats and access to intelligence, became home to a circle of resistance, under the discreet patronage of the Under-Secretary of State [[Ernst von Weizs\u00e4cker]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The nemesis of power : the German Army in politics, 1918-1945|last=1902-1975.|first=Wheeler-Bennett, John Wheeler, Sir|date=2005|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|others=Overy, R.

They recognised that it was impossible to stage any kind of open political resistance. This was not, as is sometimes stated, because the repressive apparatus of the regime was so all-pervasive that public protest was impossible \u2013 as was shown when Catholics protested against the removal of crucifixes from Oldenburg schools in 1936, and the regime backed down. Rather it was because of Hitler's massive support among the German people. While resistance movements in the occupied countries could mobilise patriotic sentiment against the German occupiers, in Germany the resistance risked being seen as unpatriotic, particularly in wartime. Even many army officers and officials who detested Hitler had a deep aversion to being involved in \"subversive\" or \"treasonous\" acts against the government.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAs early as 1936, Oster and Gisevius came to the view that a regime so totally dominated by one man could only be brought down by eliminating that man \u2013 either by assassinating Hitler or by staging an army coup against him. However, it was a long time before any significant number of Germans came to accept this view. Many clung to the belief that Hitler could be persuaded to moderate his regime, or that some other more moderate figure could replace him. Others argued that Hitler was not to blame for the regime's excesses, and that the removal of [[Heinrich Himmler]] and reduction in the power of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] was needed. Some oppositionists were devout Christians who disapproved of assassination as a matter of principle. Others, particularly the army officers, felt bound by the [[Hitler oath|personal oath of loyalty they had taken to Hitler]] in 1934.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe opposition was also hampered by a lack of agreement about their objectives other than the need to remove Hitler from power. Some oppositionists were liberals who opposed the ideology of the Nazi regime in its entirety, and who wished to restore a system of parliamentary [[democracy]]. Most of the army officers and many of the civil servants, however, were conservatives and nationalists, and many had initially supported Hitler's policies \u2013 [[Carl Goerdeler]], the Lord Mayor of [[Leipzig]], was a good example. Some favored restoring the [[Hohenzollern dynasty]], while others favored an authoritarian, but not Nazi, regime. Some saw no problem with Hitler's anti-Semitism and ultra-nationalism, and opposed only his apparent reckless determination to take Germany into a new world war. Because of their many differences, the opposition was unable to form a united movement, or to send a coherent message to potential allies outside Germany.<ref name=\"shirer\" />\n\n==Role of the churches==\nThough neither the Catholic nor Protestant churches as institutions were prepared to openly oppose the Nazi State, it was from the clergy that the first major component of the German Resistance to the policies of the Third Reich emerged, and the churches as institutions provided the earliest and most enduring centres of systematic opposition to Nazi policies.

Hamerow, could indirectly \"articulate political dissent in the guise of pastoral stricture\". They usually spoke out not against the established system, but \"only against specific policies that it had mistakenly adopted and that it should therefore properly correct\".<ref>Theodore S.

This was the programme of so-called \u201c[[euthanasia]]\u201d \u2013 in fact a campaign of mass murder \u2013 directed at people with mental illness and/or severe physical disabilities which had begun in 1939 under the code name [[T-4 Euthanasia Program|T4]]. By 1941, more than 70,000 people had been killed under this programme, many by gassing, and their bodies incinerated. This policy aroused strong opposition across German society, and especially among Catholics. Opposition to the policy sharpened after the German attack on the [[Soviet Union]] in June 1941, because the war in the east produced for the first time large-scale German casualties, and the hospitals and asylums began to fill up with maimed and disabled young German soldiers. Rumours began to circulate that these men would also be subject to \u201ceuthanasia,\u201d although no such plans existed.\n\nCatholic anger was further fuelled by actions of the [[Gauleiter]] of [[Upper Bavaria]], [[Adolf Wagner]], a militantly anti-Catholic Nazi, who in June 1941 ordered the removal of crucifixes from all schools in his Gau. This attack on Catholicism provoked the first public demonstrations against government policy since the Nazis had come to power, and the mass signing of petitions, including by Catholic soldiers serving at the front. When Hitler heard of this he ordered Wagner to rescind his decree, but the damage had been done \u2013 German Catholics had learned that the regime could be successfully opposed. This led to more outspoken protests against the \u201ceuthanasia\u201d programme.\n\nIn July, the [[Bishop of M\u00fcnster]], [[Clemens August Graf von Galen]] (an old aristocratic conservative, like many of the anti-Hitler army officers), publicly denounced the \u201ceuthanasia\u201d programme in a sermon, and telegrammed his text to Hitler, calling on \u201cthe F\u00fchrer to defend the people against the Gestapo.\u201d Another Bishop, [[Franz Bornewasser]] of [[Trier]], also sent protests to Hitler, though not in public. On 3 August, Galen was even more outspoken, broadening his attack to include the Nazi persecution of religious orders and the closing of Catholic institutions. Local Nazis asked for Galen to be arrested, but Propaganda Minister [[Joseph Goebbels]] told Hitler that if this happened there would be an open revolt in Westphalia. Galen's sermons went further than defending the church, he spoke of a moral danger to Germany from the regime's violations of basic human rights: \"the right to life, to inviolability, and to freedom is an indispensable part of any moral social order\", he said - and any government that punishes without court proceedings \"undermines its own authority and respect for its sovereignty  within the conscience of its citizens\".<ref>Theodore S.

Hitler was jeered by an angry crowd at [[Hof, Germany|Hof]], near [[Nuremberg]] \u2013 the only time he was opposed to his face in public during his 12 years of rule.<ref>Gitta Sereny, ''Into That Darkness'' (New York: McGraw-Hill 1974; reprint, Vintage Books, 1983) at 59.</ref> Hitler knew that he could not afford a confrontation with the Church at a time when Germany was engaged in a life-and-death two-front war. (It needs to be remembered that following the annexations of [[Austria]] and the [[Sudetenland]], nearly half of all Germans were Catholic.) On 24 August he ordered the cancellation of the T4 programme and issued strict instructions to the Gauleiters that there were to be no further provocations of the churches during the war.\n\n[[Pius XII]] became Pope on the eve of [[World War II]], and [[Pius XII and the German Resistance|maintained links to the German Resistance]]. Although remaining publicly neutral, Pius advised the British in 1940 of the readiness of certain German generals to overthrow Hitler if they could be assured of an honourable peace, offered assistance to the German resistance in the event of a coup and warned the Allies of the planned German invasion of the Low Countries in 1940.<ref>John Toland; Hitler; Wordsworth Editions; 1997 Edn; p. 760</ref><ref>William L.

He stated his \"profound grief\" at the murder of the deformed, the insane, and those suffering from hereditary disease... as though they were a useless burden to Society\", in condemnation of the ongoing [[euthanasia in Nazi Germany|Nazi euthanasia program]]. The Encyclical was followed, on 26 September 1943, by an open condemnation by the German Bishops which, from every German pulpit, denounced the killing of \"innocent and defenceless mentally handicapped, incurably infirm and fatally wounded, innocent hostages, and disarmed prisoners of war and criminal offenders, people of a foreign race or descent\".<ref>Richard J.

In May 1938, the army leadership was made aware of Hitler's intention of invading [[Czechoslovakia]], even at the risk of war with [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[France]], and/or the [[Soviet Union]]. The Army Chief of Staff, General [[Ludwig Beck]], regarded this as not only immoral but reckless, since he believed that Germany would lose such a war. Oster and Beck sent emissaries to Paris and London to advise the British and French to resist Hitler's demands, and thereby strengthen the hand of Hitler's opponents in the Army. Weizs\u00e4cker also sent private messages to London urging resistance. The British and French were extremely doubtful of the ability of the German opposition to overthrow the Nazi regime and ignored these messages. An official of the British Foreign Office wrote on August 28, 1938: \"We have had similar visits from other emissaries of the ''Reichsheer'', such as Dr. Goerdeler, but those for whom these emissaries claim to speak have never given us any reasons to suppose that they would be able or willing to take action such as would lead to the overthrow of the regime.

When Hitler was informed of this, he demanded and received Beck's resignation. Beck was highly respected in the army and his removal shocked the officer corps. His successor as chief of staff, [[Franz Halder]], remained in touch with him, and was also in touch with Oster. Privately, he said that he considered Hitler \"the incarnation of evil\".<ref>Joachim Fest, ''Plotting Hitler\u2019s Death: The German Resistance to Hitler 1933\u20131945'', 86</ref> During September, plans for a move against Hitler were formulated, involving General [[Erwin von Witzleben]], who was the army commander of the Berlin Military Region and thus well-placed to stage a coup.\n\nOster, Gisevius, and Schacht urged Halder and Beck to stage an immediate coup against Hitler, but the army officers argued that they could only mobilize support among the officer corps for such a step if Hitler made overt moves towards war. Halder nevertheless asked Oster to draw up plans for a coup. Weizs\u00e4cker and Canaris were made aware of these plans. The conspirators disagreed on what to do about Hitler if there was a successful army coup \u2013 eventually most overcame their scruples and agreed that he must be killed so that army officers would be free from their oath of loyalty. They agreed Halder would instigate the coup when Hitler committed an overt step towards war. During the planning for the 1938 ''putsch'', [[Carl Friedrich Goerdeler]] was in contact through the intermediary of General [[Alexander von Falkenhausen]] with Chinese intelligence<ref name=\"Liang, His-Huey page 359\">Liang, His-Huey \"China, the Sino-Japanese Conflict and the Munich Crisis\" pages 342\u2013369 from ''The Munich Crisis'' edited by Erik Goldstein and Igor Lukes, London: Frank Cass, 1999 page 359</ref> Most German conservatives favoured Germany's traditional informal alliance with China, and were strongly opposed to the about-face in Germany's Far Eastern policies effected in early 1938 by [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]], who abandoned the alliance with China for an alignment with Japan.<ref name=\"Liang, His-Huey page 359\"/> As a consequence, agents of Chinese intelligence supported the proposed ''putsch'' as a way of restoring the Sino-German alliance.<ref name=\"Liang, His-Huey page 359\"/>\n\nRemarkably, the army commander, General [[Walther von Brauchitsch]], was well aware of the coup preparations. He told Halder he could not condone such an act, but he did not inform Hitler, to whom he was outwardly subservient, of what he knew.<ref>Joachim Fest, ''Plotting Hitler\u2019s Death: The German Resistance to Hitler 1933\u20131945'', 95</ref> This was a striking example of the code of silent solidarity among senior German Army officers, which was to survive and provide a shield for the resistance groups down to, and in many cases beyond, the crisis of July 1944.\n\n===Munich crisis===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R69173, M\u00fcnchener Abkommen, Staatschefs.jpg|thumb|left|From left to right, [[Neville Chamberlain]], [[\u00c9douard Daladier]], [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Benito Mussolini]] and Italian Foreign Minister [[Count Ciano]] as they prepare to sign the [[Munich Agreement]]]]\n\nOn 13 September, the British Prime Minister, [[Neville Chamberlain]], announced that he would visit Germany to meet Hitler and defuse the crisis over Czechoslovakia. This threw the conspirators into uncertainty. When, on 20 September, it appeared that the negotiations had broken down and that Chamberlain would resist Hitler's demands, the coup preparations were revived and finalised. All that was required was the signal from Halder.\n\nOn 28 September, however Chamberlain agreed to a [[Munich Agreement|meeting in Munich]], at which he accepted the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia. This plunged the resistance into demoralisation and division. Halder said he would no longer support a coup. The other conspirators were bitterly critical of Chamberlain, but were powerless to act. This was the nearest approach to a successful conspiracy against Hitler before the plot of 20 July 1944. In December 1938, Goerdeler visited Britain to seek support.{{sfn|Hammerow|1997|p=258}} Goerdeler's demands for the Polish Corridor to be returned to Germany together with former colonies in Africa together with a loan to a post-Hitler government made a very poor impression with the British Foreign Office, not the least because he seemed to differ with the Nazis only in degree rather in kind.{{sfn|Hammerow|1997|p=257-259}} In June 1939, Adam von Trott visited Britain where he presented his \"Danzig for Prague\" plan, offering to restore Czech independence (through Germany would keep the Sudetenland) in exchange for which Britain would pressure Poland to return the Polish Corridor and the Free City of Danzig to Germany.{{sfn|Hammerow|1997|p=259-260}}\n\nAs war again grew more likely in mid-1939, the plans for a pre-emptive coup were revived. Oster was still in contact with Halder and Witzleben, although Witzleben had been transferred to [[Frankfurt am Main]], reducing his ability to lead a coup attempt. At a meeting with Goerdeler, Witzleben agreed to form a network of army commanders willing to take part to prevent a war against the western powers. But support in the officer corps for a coup had dropped sharply since 1938. Most officers, particularly those from [[Prussian aristocracy|Prussian landowning backgrounds]], were strongly anti-Polish. Just before the invasion of [[Poland]] in August 1939, General [[Eduard Wagner]] who was one of the officers involved in the abortive ''putsch'' of September 1938, wrote in a letter to his wife: \u201cWe believe we will make quick work of the Poles, and in truth, we are delighted at the prospect. That business ''must'' be cleared up\" (Emphasis in the original)<ref name=\"Hillgruber, Andreas page 77\">Hillgruber, Andreas ''Germany and the Two World Wars'' Harvard University Press: Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America, 1981 page 77</ref> The German historian [[Andreas Hillgruber]] commented that in 1939 the rampant [[Anti-Polish sentiment|anti-Polish]] feelings in the German Army officer corps served to bind the military together with Hitler in supporting [[Fall Weiss (1939)|Fall Weiss]] in a way that [[Fall Gr\u00fcn (Czechoslovakia)|Fall Gr\u00fcn]] did not.<ref name=\"Hillgruber, Andreas page 77\"/> The officers who had willing to consider taking part in a ''putsch'' in 1938 loyally rallied to the Nazi regime in 1939 when faced with the prospect of war with Poland.{{sfn|Hammerow|1997|p=261-262}} Likewise, the Catholic Bishop Galen delivered a sermon calling the war against Poland a struggle to \"win a peace of freedom and justice for our nation\".{{sfn|Hammerow|1997|p=262}}\n\nThis nevertheless marked an important turning point. In 1938, the plan had been for the army, led by Halder and if possible Brauchitsch, to depose Hitler. This was now impossible, and a conspiratorial organisation was to be formed in the army and civil service instead.\n\nThe opposition again urged Britain and France to stand up to Hitler: Halder met secretly with the British Ambassador Sir [[Nevile Henderson]] to urge resistance. The plan was again to stage a coup at the moment Hitler moved to declare war. However, although Britain and France were now prepared to go to war over Poland, as war approached, Halder lost his nerve. Schacht, Gisevius and Canaris developed a plan to confront Brauchitsch and Halder and demand that they depose Hitler and prevent war, but nothing came of this. When Hitler invaded Poland on 1 September, the conspirators were unable to act.\n\n===Outbreak of war===\nThe outbreak of war made the further mobilization of resistance in the army more difficult. Halder continued to vacillate. In late 1939 and early 1940 he opposed Hitler's plans to attack France, and kept in touch with the opposition through General [[Carl-Heinrich von St\u00fclpnagel]], an active oppositionist. Talk of a coup again began to circulate, and for the first time the idea of killing Hitler with a bomb was taken up by the more determined members of the resistance circles, such as Oster and Erich Kordt, who declared himself willing to do the deed. At the army headquarters at [[Zossen]], south of Berlin, a group of officers called Action Group Zossen was also planning a coup.\n\nWhen in November 1939 it seemed that Hitler was about to order an immediate attack in the west, the conspirators persuaded General [[Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb]], commander of Army Group C on the Belgian border, to support a planned coup if Hitler gave such an order. At the same time Oster warned the Dutch and the Belgians that Hitler was about to attack them \u2013 his warnings were not believed. But when Hitler postponed the attack until 1940, the conspiracy again lost momentum, and Halder formed the view that the German people would not accept a coup. Again, the chance was lost.\n\nWith Poland overrun but France and the Low Countries yet to be attacked, the German Resistance sought the Pope's assistance in preparations for a coup to oust Hitler.<ref name=\"John Toland p.760\">John Toland; ''Hitler''; Wordsworth Editions; 1997 Edn; p.760</ref> In the winter of 1939/40, the Bavarian lawyer and reserve 'Abwehr' officer [[Josef M\u00fcller (CSU politician)|Josef M\u00fcller]], acting as an emissary for the military opposition centered around General Franz Halder, contacted Monsignore [[Ludwig Kaas]], the exiled leader of the German Catholic [[Centre Party (Germany)|Zentrum]] party, in Rome, hoping to use the Pope as an intermediary to contact the British.<ref>Chadwick, 1988, pp. 86-87</ref> Kaas put M\u00fcller in contact with Father [[Robert Leiber]], who personally asked the Pope to relay the information about the German resistance to the British.<ref name=\"c87\">Chadwick, 1988, p. 87</ref>\n\nThe Vatican considered M\u00fcller to be a representative of Colonel-General von Beck and agreed to offer the machinery for mediation.<ref name=\"Peter Hoffmann p.160\">Peter Hoffmann; The History of the German Resistance 1933-1945; 3rd Edn (First English Edn); McDonald & Jane's; London; 1977; p.160</ref><ref name=\"William L.

Shirer; The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich; Secker & Warburg; London; 1960; p648-9</ref>  Oster, [[Wilhelm Canaris]] and [[Hans von Dohn\u00e1nyi]], backed by Beck, told M\u00fcller to ask Pius to ascertain whether the British would enter negotiations with the German opposition which wanted to overthrow Hitler. The British agreed to negotiate, provided the Vatican could vouch for the opposition's representative. Pius, communicating with Britain's [[Francis d'Arcy Osborne]], channelled communications back and forth in secrecy.<ref name=\"Peter Hoffmann p.160\"/> The Vatican agreed to send a letter outlining the bases for peace with England and the participation of the Pope was used to try to persuade senior German Generals Halder and Brauchitsch to act against Hitler.<ref name=\"John Toland p.760\"/> Negotiations were tense, with a Western offensive expected, and on the basis that substantive negotiations could only follow the replacement of the Hitler regime.<ref name=\"Peter Hoffmann p.160\"/> Pius, without offering endorsement, advised Osbourne on 11 January 1940 that the German opposition had said that a German offensive was planned for February, but that this could be averted if the German generals could be assured of peace with Britain, and not on punitive terms. If this could be assured, then they were willing to move to replace Hitler. The British government had doubts as to the capacity of the conspirators. On 7 February, the Pope updated Osbourne that the opposition wanted to replace the Nazi regime with a democratic federation, but hoped to retain Austria and the Sudetenland. The British government was non-committal, and said that while the federal model was of interest, the promises and sources of the opposition were too vague. Nevertheless, the resistance were encouraged by the talks, and Muller told his contact that a coup would occur in February. Pius appeared to continue to hope for a coup in Germany into March 1940.<ref>Peter Hoffmann; The History of the German Resistance 1933-1945; 3rd Edn (First English Edn); McDonald & Jane's; London; 1977; p.160-163</ref>\n\nFollowing the Fall of France, peace overtures continued to emanate from the Vatican as well as Sweden and the United States, to which Churchill responded resolutely that Germany would first have to free its conquered territories.<ref>William L. Shirer; The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich; Secker & Warburg; London; 1960; p. 750</ref> The negotiations ultimately proved fruitless. Hitler's swift victories over France and the Low Countries deflated the will of the German military to resist Hitler. Muller was arrested during the Nazis first raid on Military Intelligence in 1943. He spent the rest of the war in concentration camps, ending up at Dachau.<ref>[[Joachim Fest]]; ''Plotting Hitler's Death: The German Resistance to Hitler 1933\u201345''; Weidenfeld & Nicolson 1996 p.131</ref>\n\nThe failed plots of 1938 and 1939 showed both the strength and weakness of the officer corps as potential leaders of a resistance movement. Its strength was its loyalty and solidarity. As [[Istvan Deak]] noted: \"Officers, especially of the highest ranks, had been discussing, some as early as 1934&nbsp;... the possibility of deposing or even assassinating Hitler. Yet it seems that not a single one was betrayed by a comrade-in-arms to the Gestapo.\"<ref>New York Review of Books, 13 January 1994</ref> Remarkably, in over two years of plotting, this widespread and loosely structured conspiracy was never detected. One explanation is that at this time Himmler was still preoccupied with the traditional enemies of the Nazis, the SPD and the KPD (and, of course, the Jews), and did not suspect that the real centre of opposition was within the state itself. Another factor was Canaris\u2019 success in shielding the plotters, particularly Oster, from suspicion.\n\nThe corresponding weakness of the officer corps was its conception of loyalty to the state and its aversion to mutiny. This explains the vacillations of Halder, who could never quite bring himself to take the decisive step. Halder hated Hitler, and believed that the Nazis were leading Germany to catastrophe. He was shocked and disgusted by the behaviour of the SS in occupied Poland, but gave no support to his senior officer there, General [[Johannes Blaskowitz]], when the latter officially protested to Hitler about the atrocities against the Poles and the Jews. In 1938 and again in 1939, he lost his nerve and could not give the order to strike against Hitler. This was even more true of Brauchitsch, who knew of the conspiracies and assured Halder that he agreed with their objectives, but would not take any action to support them.\n\nThe outbreak of war served to rally the German people around the Hitler regime, and the sweeping early successes of the German Army \u2013 occupying Poland in 1939, Denmark and Norway in April 1940, and swiftly defeating France in May and June 1940, stilled virtually all opposition to the regime. The opposition to Hitler within the Army was left isolated and apparently discredited, since the much-feared war with the western powers had apparently been won by Germany within a year and at little cost. This mood continued well into 1941, although beneath the surface popular discontent at mounting economic hardship was apparent.\n\n==First assassination attempt==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-E12329, M\u00fcnchen, B\u00fcrgerbr\u00e4ukeller, Sprengstoffanschlag.jpg|thumb|Ruins of the [[B\u00fcrgerbr\u00e4ukeller]] in [[Munich]] after [[Georg Elser]]'s failed assassination of Hitler in November 1939]]\n\nIn November 1939, [[Georg Elser]], a carpenter from [[W\u00fcrttemberg]], developed a plan to assassinate Hitler completely on his own. Elser had been peripherally involved with the KPD before 1933, but his exact motives for acting as he did remain a mystery. He read in the newspapers that Hitler would be addressing a Nazi Party meeting on 8 November, in the [[B\u00fcrgerbr\u00e4ukeller]], a beer hall in [[Munich]] where Hitler had launched the [[Beer Hall Putsch]] on the same date in 1923. Stealing explosives from his workplace, he built a powerful time bomb, and for over a month managed to stay inside the B\u00fcrgerbr\u00e4ukeller after hours each night, during which time he hollowed out the pillar behind the speaker's rostrum to place the bomb inside.\n\nOn the night of 7 November 1939, Elser set the timer and left for the Swiss border. Unexpectedly, because of the pressure of wartime business, Hitler made a much shorter speech than usual and left the hall 13 minutes before the bomb went off, killing seven people. Sixty-three people were injured, sixteen more were seriously injured with one dying later. Had Hitler still been speaking, the bomb almost certainly would have killed him.\n\nThis event set off a hunt for potential conspirators which intimidated the opposition and made further action more difficult. Elser was arrested at the border, sent to the Sachsenhausen Concentration Camp, and then in 1945 moved to the [[Dachau concentration camp]]; he was executed two weeks before the liberation of Dachau KZ.\n\n==Nadir of resistance: 1940\u201342==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2008}}\nIn February 1940, [[Ulrich von Hassell]] met with [[James Lonsdale-Bryans]] to discuss plans to \"stop this mad war\".{{sfn|Hammerow|1997|p=277}} The peace terms that Hassell unveiled stated that Germany would keep the Sudetenland and Austria while \"the German-Polish frontier will have be more or less identical with the German frontier of 1914\".{{sfn|Hammerow|1997|p=277}} Though Britain in 1940 was prepared to cede the first two demands, but the demand that Poland was to surrender land to Germany as part of a peace terms proved to be a problem.{{sfn|Hammerow|1997|p=277-278}}\n\nThe national-conservatives were strongly opposed to the Treaty of Versailles and tended to support the aims of Nazi foreign policy, at least when it came to challenging Versailles.{{sfn|Hammerow|1997|p=276}} In their plans for a post-Nazi Germany, the conservatives took it for granted that Germany would keep the Sudetenland, Austria, the Memelland, and all of the parts of Poland that had once been German.{{sfn|Hammerow|1997|p=276}} Most were willing to consider restoring nominal independence to the Poles and Czechs, but even then, both the reduced Polish and Czech states would have to be \"client states\" of the ''Reich''.{{sfn|Hammerow|1997|p=276}} Objections to Nazi foreign policy tended to be over the means, not the ends, with most conservatives taking the viewpoint that Hitler had conducted his foreign policy in a gratuitously aggressive manner that had caused war with Britain and France, made all the more objectionable because the policy of appeasement showed a willingness to accept Germany's return to great power status without a war.{{sfn|Hammerow|1997|p=276-277}}\n\nThe sweeping success of Hitler's attack on France in May 1940 made the task of deposing him even more difficult. Most army officers, their fears of a war against the western powers apparently proven groundless, and gratified by Germany's revenge against France for the defeat of 1918, reconciled themselves to Hitler's regime, choosing to ignore its darker side. The task of leading the resistance groups for a time fell to civilians, although a hard core of military plotters remained active.\n\n[[Carl Goerdeler]], the former lord mayor of [[Leipzig]], emerged as a key figure. His associates included the diplomat [[Ulrich von Hassell]], the Prussian Finance Minister [[Johannes Popitz]], and [[Helmuth James Graf von Moltke]], heir to a famous name and the leading figure in the [[Kreisau Circle]] of Prussian oppositionists. These opposionists included other young aristocrats such as [[Adam von Trott zu Solz]] and [[Peter Yorck von Wartenburg]], and later [[Gottfried Graf von Bismarck-Sch\u00f6nhausen]], who was a Nazi member of the Reichstag and a senior officer in the SS. Goerdeler was also in touch with the SPD underground, whose most prominent figure was [[Julius Leber]], and with Christian opposition groups, both Catholic and Protestant.\n\nThese men saw themselves as the leaders of a post-Hitler government, but they had no clear conception of how to bring this about, except through assassinating Hitler \u2013 a step which many of them still opposed on ethical grounds. Their plans could never surmount the fundamental problem of Hitler's overwhelming popularity among the German people. They preoccupied themselves with philosophical debates and devising grand schemes for postwar Germany. The fact was that for nearly two years after the defeat of France, there was little scope for opposition activity.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1976-130-53, Henning v. Tresckow.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Henning von Tresckow]]]]\n\nIn March 1941, Hitler revealed his plans for a \"war of annihilation\" against the Soviet Union to selected army officers in a speech given in [[Pozna\u0144|Posen]]. In the audience was Colonel [[Henning von Tresckow]], who had not been involved in any of the earlier plots but was already a firm opponent of the Nazi regime. He was horrified by Hitler's plan to unleash a new and even more terrible war in the east. As a nephew of Field Marshal [[Fedor von Bock]], he was very well connected. Tresckow appealed unsuccessfully to Bock to not enforce the orders for the \"war of annihilation\".{{sfn|Hammerow|1997|p=292}}   Assigned to the staff of his uncle's command, Army Group Centre, for the forthcoming [[Operation Barbarossa]], Tresckow systematically recruited oppositionists to the group's staff, making it the new nerve centre of the army resistance.\n\nAmerican journalist [[Howard K. Smith]] wrote in 1942 that of the three groups in opposition to Hitler, the military was more important than the churches and the Communists.<ref name=\"smith1942\">{{cite book | title=Last Train from Berlin | publisher=Knopf | author=Smith, Howard K. | authorlink=Howard K. Smith | year=1942 | pages=281}}</ref> Little could be done while Hitler's armies advanced triumphantly into the western regions of the Soviet Union through 1941 and 1942 \u2013 even after the setback before [[Moscow]] in December 1941 that led to the dismissal of both Brauchitsch and Bock. In December 1941, the [[United States]] entered the war, persuading some more realistic army officers that Germany must ultimately lose the war. But the life-and-death struggle on the eastern front posed new problems for the resistance. Most of its members were conservatives who hated and feared [[communism]] and the Soviet Union. The question of how the Nazi regime could be overthrown and the war ended without allowing the Soviets to gain control of Germany or the whole of Europe was made more acute when the Allies adopted their policy of demanding Germany's \"unconditional surrender\" at the [[Casablanca Conference (1943)|Casablanca Conference]] of January 1943.\n\nDuring 1942, the tireless Oster nevertheless succeeded in rebuilding an effective resistance network. His most important recruit was General [[Friedrich Olbricht]], head of the General Army Office headquartered at the [[Bendlerblock]] in central Berlin, who controlled an independent system of communications to reserve units all over Germany. Linking this asset to Tresckow's resistance group in Army Group Centre created what appeared to a viable structure for a new effort at organising a coup. Bock's dismissal did not weaken Tresckow's position. In fact he soon enticed Bock's successor, General [[G\u00fcnther von Kluge|Hans von Kluge]], at least part-way to supporting the resistance cause. Tresckow even brought Goerdeler, leader of the civilian resistance, to Army Group Centre to meet Kluge \u2013 an extremely dangerous tactic.\n\nConservatives like Goerdeler were opposed to the Treaty of Versailles and favored restoring the ''Reich'' back to the frontiers of 1914 together with keeping Austria.{{sfn|Mommsen|2003|p=183-184}} These territorial demands for keeping Alsace-Lorraine together with the parts of Poland that had once belonged to Germany made for many difficulties in Goerdeler's attempts to reach an accord with governments of Britain and the United States.{{sfn|Mommsen|2003|p=184}} Stauffenberg felt that these were unrealistic demands and Goerdeler would have done better if he was prepared to accept a return to the frontiers created by the Treaty of Versailles. Most of the conservatives favored the creation of an unified Europe led by Germany after the planned overthrow of Hitler.{{sfn|Mommsen|2003|p=184-185}} Goerdeler in particular devoted much thought in his memos for a federation of European states and a pan-European economy while Hassell wrote in his diary of his hopes for an \"Occident under German leadership\".{{sfn|Mommsen|2003|p=185}} Moltke envisioned \"a great economic community would emerge from the demobilization of armed forces in Europe\" that would be \"managed by an internal European economic bureaucracy\".{{sfn|Mommsen|2003|p=188}} Trott advocated the tariff and currency union of all the European states, a common European citizenship and a Supreme Court for Europe.{{sfn|Mommsen|2003|p=189}} As late as May 1944, Goerdeler prepared peace terms that once again called for keeping Austria, the Sudetenland, the Memelland, various parts of Poland, Alsace-Lorraine, and a new demand for keeping South Tirol as well.{{sfn|Hammerow|1997|p=347}} Even General Beck warned Goerdeler that these demands were completely detached from reality, and would be rejected by the Allies.{{sfn|Hammerow|1997|p=347-348}}\n\n==Communist resistance==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2008}}\n[[File:Memorial to Harro Schulze-Boysen.JPG|thumb|Memorial to Harro Schulze-Boysen, [[Niederkirchnerstrasse]], Berlin]]\n\nThe entry of the Soviet Union into the war had certain consequences for the civilian resistance. During the period of the [[Nazi\u2013Soviet Pact]], the [[Communist Party of Germany|KPD]]'s only objective inside Germany was to keep itself in existence: it engaged in no active resistance to the Nazi regime. After June 1941, however, all Communists were expected to throw themselves into resistance work, including sabotage and espionage where this was possible, regardless of risk. A handful of Soviet agents, mostly exiled German Communists, were able to enter Germany to help the scattered underground KPD cells organise and take action. This led to the formation in 1942 of two separate communist groups, usually erroneously lumped together under the name [[Red Orchestra (spy)|Rote Kapelle]] (\"Red Orchestra\"), a codename given to these groups by the Gestapo.\n\nThe first \"Red Orchestra\" was an espionage network based in Berlin and coordinated by [[Leopold Trepper]], a [[GRU]] agent sent into Germany in October 1941. This group made reports to the Soviet Union on German troop concentrations, air attacks on Germany, German aircraft production, and German fuel shipments. In France, it worked with the underground [[French Communist Party]]. Agents of this group even managed to tap the phone lines of the Abwehr in Paris. Trepper was eventually arrested and the group broken up by the spring of 1943.\n\nThe second and more important \"Red Orchestra\" group was entirely separate and was a genuine German resistance group, not controlled by the [[NKVD]] (the Soviet intelligence agency and predecessor to the [[KGB]]). This group was led by [[Harro Schulze-Boysen]], an intelligence officer at the [[Reich Air Ministry]], and [[Arvid Harnack]], an official in the Ministry of Economics, both self-identified communists but not apparently KPD members. The group however contained people of various beliefs and affiliations. It included the theatre producer [[Adam Kuckhoff]], the author [[G\u00fcnther Weisenborn]], the journalist [[John Graudenz]] and the pianist [[Helmut Roloff]]. It thus conformed to the general pattern of German resistance groups of being drawn mainly from elite groups.\n\nThe main activity of the group was collecting information about Nazi atrocities and distributing leaflets against Hitler rather than espionage. They passed what they had learned to foreign countries, through personal contacts with the U.S. embassy and, via a less direct connection, to the Soviet government. When Soviet agents tried to enlist this group in their service, Schulze-Boysen and Harnack refused, since they wanted to maintain their political independence. The group was revealed to the Gestapo in August 1942 by [[Johann Wenzel]], a member of the Trepper group who also knew of the Schulze-Boysen group and who informed on them after being discovered and tortured for several weeks . Schulze-Boysen, Harnack and other members of the group were arrested and secretly executed.\n\nMeanwhile, another Communist resistance group was operating in Berlin, led by a Jewish electrician, [[Herbert Baum]], and involving up to a hundred people. Until 1941, the group operated a study circle, but after the German attack on the Soviet Union a core group advanced to active resistance. In May 1942, the group staged an arson attack on an anti-Soviet propaganda display at the [[Lustgarten]] in central Berlin. The attack was poorly organised and most of the Baum group was arrested. Twenty were sentenced to death, while Baum himself \"died in custody\". This fiasco ended overt Communist resistance activities, although the KPD underground continued to operate, and re-emerged from hiding in the last days of the war.\n\n==After Stalingrad==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-E0406-0022-011, Russland, deutscher Kriegsgefangener.jpg|thumb|Red Army soldier marches a German soldier into captivity after the victory at the [[Battle of Stalingrad]]]]\nAt the end of 1942, Germany suffered a series of military defeats, the first at [[Second Battle of El Alamein|El Alamein]], the second with the successful Allied landings in North Africa ([[Operation Torch]]), and the third the disastrous defeat at [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]], which ended any hope of defeating the Soviet Union. Most experienced senior officers now came to the conclusion that Hitler was leading Germany to defeat, and that the result of this would be the Soviet conquest of Germany \u2013 the worst fate imaginable. This gave the military resistance new impetus.\n\nHalder had been dismissed in 1942 and there was now no independent central leadership of the Army. His nominal successors, Field Marshal [[Wilhelm Keitel]] and General [[Alfred Jodl]], were no more than Hitler's messengers. Tresckow and Goerdeler tried again to recruit the senior Army field commanders to support a seizure of power. Kluge was by now won over completely. Gersdorff was sent to see Field Marshal [[Erich von Manstein]], the commander of Army Group South in the [[Ukraine]]. Manstein agreed that Hitler was leading Germany to defeat, but told Gersdorff that \u201cPrussian field marshals do not mutiny.\u201d<ref>Joachim Fest, ''Plotting Hitler\u2019s Death: The German Resistance to Hitler 1933&ndash;1945'', 200</ref> Field Marshal [[Gerd von Rundstedt]], commander in the west, gave a similar answer. The prospect of a united German Army seizing power from Hitler was as far away as ever. Once again, however, neither officer reported that they had been approached in this way.\n\nNevertheless, the days when the military and civilian plotters could expect to escape detection were ending. After Stalingrad, Himmler would have had to be na\u00efve not to expect that conspiracies against the regime would be hatched in the Army and elsewhere. He already suspected Canaris and his subordinates at the Abwehr. In March 1943, two of them, Oster and [[Hans von Dohn\u00e1nyi]], were dismissed on suspicion of opposition activity, although there was yet insufficient evidence to have them arrested. On the civilian front, [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]] was also arrested at this time, and Goerdeler was under suspicion.\n\nThe Gestapo had been led to Dohnanyi following the arrest of {{Interlanguage link multi|Wilhelm Schmidhuber|de}}, who had helped Dohnanyi with information and with smuggling Jews out of Germany. Under interrogation, Schmidhuber gave the Gestapo details of the Oster-Dohnanyi group in the Abwehr and about Goerdeler and Beck's involvement in opposition activities. The Gestapo reported all this to Himmler, with the observation that Canaris must be protecting Oster and Dohnanyi and the recommendation that he be arrested. Himmler passed the file back with the note \"Kindly leave Canaris alone.\"<ref>Peter Padfield, ''Himmler'', 422</ref> Either Himmler felt Canaris was too powerful to tackle at this stage, or he wanted him and his oppositional network protected for reasons of his own. Nevertheless, Oster's usefulness to the resistance was now greatly reduced. However, the Gestapo did not have information about the full workings of the resistance. Most importantly, they did not know about the resistance networks based on Army Group Centre or the Bendlerblock.\n\nMeanwhile, the disaster at Stalingrad, which cost Germany 400,000 casualties, was sending waves of horror and grief through German society, but causing remarkably little reduction in the people's faith in Hitler and in Germany's ultimate victory. This was a source of great frustration to the military and civil service plotters, who virtually all came from the elite and had privileged access to information, giving them a much greater appreciation of the hopelessness of Germany's situation than was possessed by the German people.\n\n===Aeroplane assassination attempt===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Friedrich Olbricht.gif|thumb|General [[Friedrich Olbricht]]]] -->\n\nIn late 1942, von Tresckow and Olbricht formulated a plan to assassinate Hitler and stage a coup. On 13 March 1943, returning from his easternmost headquarters FHQ [[Werwolf (Wehrmacht headquarters)|Wehrwolf]] near [[Vinnytsia|Vinnitsa]] to [[Wolfsschanze]] in East Prussia, Hitler was scheduled to make a stop-over at the headquarters of [[Army Group Centre]] at [[Smolensk]]. For such an occasion, von Tresckow had prepared three options:<ref>[http://www.geschichtsthemen.de/attentate_chronik.htm Chronik aller Attentate auf Hitler<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n# Major [[Georg von Boeselager]], in command of a cavalry honor guard, could intercept Hitler in a forest and overwhelm the SS bodyguard and the F\u00fchrer in a fair fight; this course was rejected because of the prospect of a large number of German soldiers fighting each other, and a possible failure regarding the unexpected strength of the escort.\n# A joint assassination could be carried out during dinner; this idea was abandoned as supporting officers abhorred the idea of shooting the unarmed tyrant.\n# A bomb could be smuggled on Hitler's plane.\n\nVon Tresckow asked Lieutenant Colonel [[Heinz Brandt]], on Hitler's staff and usually on the same plane that carried Hitler, to take a parcel with him, supposedly the prize of a bet won by Tresckow's friend [[Helmuth Stieff|General Stieff]]. It concealed a bomb, disguised in a box for two bottles of [[Cointreau]]. Von Tresckow's aide, Lieutenant [[Fabian von Schlabrendorff]], set the fuse and handed over the parcel to Brandt who boarded the same plane as Hitler.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.lexikon-der-wehrmacht.de/Chronik/1943.htm |title=1943<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2007-07-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070804201359/http://www.lexikon-der-wehrmacht.de/Chronik/1943.htm |archive-date=2007-08-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nHitler's [[Focke-Wulf Fw 200]] ''Condor'' was expected to explode about 30 minutes later near [[Minsk]], close enough to the front to be attributed to Soviet fighters. Olbricht was to use the resulting crisis to mobilise his Reserve Army network to seize power in Berlin, Vienna, Munich and in the German [[Wehrkreis]] centres. It was an ambitious but credible plan, and might have worked if Hitler had indeed been killed, although persuading Army units to fight and overcome what could certainly have been fierce resistance from the SS could have been a major obstacle.\n\nHowever, as with Elser's bomb in 1939 and all other attempts, luck favoured Hitler again, which was attributed to \"Vorsehung\" ([[divine providence|providence]]). The British-made chemical [[pencil detonator]] on the bomb had been tested many times and was considered reliable. It went off, but the bomb did not. The [[percussion cap]] apparently became too cold as the parcel was carried in the unheated cargo hold.\n\nDisplaying great ''[[Wiktionary:sangfroid|sangfroid]]'', Schlabrendorff took the next plane to retrieve the package from Colonel Brandt before the content was discovered. The blocks of plastic explosives were later used by Gersdorff and Stauffenberg.\n\n===Suicide bombing attempts===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1976-130-51, Rudolf-Christoph v. Gersdorff.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Rudolf Christoph Freiherr von Gersdorff]]]]\nA second attempt was made a few days later on 21 March 1943, when Hitler visited an exhibition of captured Soviet weaponry in Berlin's [[Zeughaus]]. One of Tresckow's friends, Colonel [[Rudolf Christoph Freiherr von Gersdorff]], was scheduled to explain some exhibits, and volunteered to carry out a [[suicide bombing]] using the same bomb that had failed to go off on the plane, concealed on his person. However, the only new chemical fuse he could obtain was a ten-minute one. Hitler again left prematurely after hurrying through the exhibition much quicker than the scheduled 30 minutes. Gersdorff had to dash to a bathroom to defuse the bomb to save his life, and more importantly, prevent any suspicion.<ref>Philip von Boeselager, Valkyrie: The plot to kill hitler, London, Phoenix 2009, 99-105</ref> This second failure temporarily demoralised the plotters at Army Group Centre. Gersdorff reported about the attempt after the war; the footage is often seen on German TV documentaries (\"Die Nacht des Widerstands\" etc.), including a photo showing Gersdorff and Hitler.\n\n[[Axel von dem Bussche]], member of the elite [[Infantry Regiment 9]], volunteered to kill Hitler with hand grenades in November 1943 during a presentation of new winter uniforms, but the train containing them was destroyed by Allied bombs in Berlin, and the event had to be postponed. A second presentation scheduled for December at the [[Wolfsschanze]] was canceled on short notice as Hitler decided to travel to Berchtesgaden.\n\nIn January 1944, Bussche volunteered for another assassination attempt, but then he lost a leg in Russia. On February 11, another young officer, [[Ewald-Heinrich von Kleist]] tried to assassinate Hitler in the same way von dem Bussche had planned. However Hitler again canceled the event which would have allowed Kleist to approach him.\n\nOn 11 March 1944, [[Eberhard von Breitenbuch]] volunteered for an assassination attempt at the [[Berghof (Hitler)|Berghof]] using a 7.65&nbsp;mm Browning pistol concealed in his trouser pocket. He was not able to carry out the plan because guards would not allow him into the conference room with the [[F\u00fchrer]].\n\nThe next occasion was a weapons exhibition on July 7 at [[Schloss Klessheim]] near Salzburg, but [[Helmuth Stieff]] did not trigger the bomb.\n\n===The White Rose===\nThe only visible manifestation of opposition to the regime following Stalingrad was the spontaneous action of a few university students who denounced the war and the persecution and mass murder of Jews in the east. They were organised in the [[White Rose]] group, which was centered in Munich but had connections in Berlin, Hamburg, Stuttgart and Vienna.\n\nIn the spring of 1942, they launched an anti-Nazi campaign of handbills in and around the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Ludwig Maximilians University]] in Munich. This campaign continued after a brief hiatus in January 1943, when some members of the group also graffitied local buildings. They were detected and some arrested. \nThree members, [[Hans Scholl]], [[Sophie Scholl]], and [[Christoph Probst]] were to stand trial before the Nazi [[People's Court (Germany)|\"People's Court\"]], where on 22 February 1943, the President of the court, [[Roland Freisler]], sentenced them to death. They were guillotined that same day at [[Stadelheim Prison]].\n[[Kurt Huber]], a professor of philosophy and musicology, [[Alexander Schmorell]], and [[Willi Graf]] stood trial later and were sentenced to death as well, while many others were sentenced to prison terms. The last member to be executed was [[Hans Conrad Leipelt]] on 29 January 1945.\n\nThis outbreak was surprising and worrying to the Nazi regime, because the universities had been strongholds of Nazi sentiment even before Hitler had come to power. Similarly, it gave heart to the scattered and demoralised resistance groups. But the White Rose was not a sign of widespread civilian disaffection from the regime, and had no imitators elsewhere, although their sixth leaflet, re-titled \"The Manifesto of the Students of Munich\", was dropped by Allied planes in July 1943, and became widely known in World War II Germany. The underground SPD and KPD were able to maintain their networks, and reported increasing discontent at the course of the war and at the resultant economic hardship, particularly among the industrial workers and among farmers (who suffered from the acute shortage of labour with so many young men away at the front). However, there was nothing approaching active hostility to the regime. Most Germans continued to revere Hitler and blamed Himmler or other subordinates for their troubles. From late 1943, fear of the advancing Soviets and prospects of a military offensive from the Western Powers eclipsed resentment at the regime and if anything hardened the will to resist the advancing allies.\n\n== Open protest ==\nAcross the twentieth century public protest comprised a primary form of civilian opposition within [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] regimes. Potentially influential popular protests required not only public expression but the collection of a crowd of persons speaking with one voice. In addition, only protests which caused the regime to take notice and respond to are included here.\n\nImprovised protests also occurred if rarely in [[Nazi Germany]], and represent a form of resistance not wholly researched, Sybil Milton wrote already in 1984.<ref>Sybil Milton, \u201cWomen and the Holocaust,\u201d in when Biology became Destiny.</ref> [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] and [[National-socialism|National Socialism]]'s perceived dependence on the mass mobilization of his people, the \u201cracial\u201d Germans, along with the belief that Germany had lost WW I due to an unstable home front, caused the regime to be peculiarly sensitive to public, collective protests. Hitler recognized the power of collective action, advocated non-compliance toward unworthy authority (e.g. the 1923 French occupation of the Ruhr), and brought his party to power in part by mobilizing public unrest and disorder to further discredit the Weimar Republic.<ref>Hitler ''Mein Kampf,'' 1939: 465, 780, 81</ref> In power, Nazi leaders quickly banned extra-party demonstrations, fearing displays of dissent on open urban spaces might develop and grow, even without organization.\n\nTo direct attention away from dissent, the Nazi state appeased some public, collective protests by \u201cracial\u201d Germans and ignored but did not repress others, both before and during the war. The regime rationalized appeasement of public protests as temporary measures to maintain the appearance of German unity and reduce the risk of alienating the public through blatant Gestapo repression. Examples of compromises for tactical reasons include social and material concessions to workers, deferment of punishing oppositional church leaders, \u201ctemporary\u201d exemptions of intermarried Jews from the Holocaust, failure to punish hundreds of thousands of women for disregarding Hitler's \u2018total war\u2019 decree conscripting women into the work force, and rejection of coercion to enforce civilian evacuations from urban areas bombed by the Allies.\n\nAn early defeat of state institutions and Nazi officials by mass, popular protest culminated with Hitler's release and reinstatement to church office of Protestant bishops [[Hans Meiser (bishop)|Hans Meiser]] and [[Theophil Wurm]] in October 1934.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Popular opinion and political dissent in the Third Reich, Bavaria 1933-1945|last=Ian|first=Kershaw|date=2002|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=0199251118|edition=New|location=Oxford|oclc=50479485}}</ref> Meiser's arrest two weeks earlier had stirred mass public protests of thousands in [[Bavaria]] and [[W\u00fcrttemberg]] and initiated protests to the [[German Foreign Ministry]] from countries around the world. Unrest had festered between regional Protestants and the state since early 1934 and came to a boil in mid-September when the regional party daily accused Meiser of treason, and shameful betrayal of Hitler and the state. By the time Hitler intervened, pastors were increasingly involving parishioners in the church struggle. Their agitation was amplifying distrust of the state as protest was worsening and spreading rapidly. Alarm among local officials was escalating. Some six thousand gathered in support of Meiser while only a few dutifully showed up at a meeting of the region's party leader, [[Julius Streicher]]. Mass open protests, the form of agitation and bandwagon building the Nazis employed so successfully, were now working against them. When Streicher's deputy, [[Karl Holz (Nazi)|Karl Holz]], held a mass rally in [[Nuremberg|Nuremberg's]] main square, Adolf-Hitler-Platz, the director of the city's Protestant Seminary led his students into the square, encouraging others along the way to join, where they effectively sabotaged the Nazi rally and broke out singing \u201cA Mighty Fortress is our God.\u201d To rehabilitate Meiser and bring the standoff to a close, Hitler, who in January had publicly condemned the bishops in their presence as \u201ctraitors to the people, enemies of the Fatherland, and the destroyers of Germany,\u201d arranged a mass audience including the bishops and spoke in conciliatory tones.<ref name=\":3\">Kuller, Christiane (2015). Stoltzfus, Nathan; Maier-Katkin, Birgit, eds. ''Protest in Hitler's \"National Community\": Popular Unrest and the Nazi Response''. New York: Berghahn Books.</ref>\n\nThis early contest points to enduring characteristics of regime responses to open, collective protests. It would prefer dealing with mass dissent immediately and decisively\u2014not uncommonly retracting the cause of protest with local and policy-specific concessions. Open dissent, left unchecked, tended to spread and worsen. Church leaders had improvised a counter-demonstration strong enough to neutralize the party's rally just as the Nazi Party had faced down socialist and communist demonstrators while coming to power.<ref name=\":2\" /> Instructive in this case is the view of a high state official that, regardless of the protesters motives, they were political in effect; although church protests were in defense of traditions rather than an attack on the regime, they nonetheless had political consequences, the official said, with many perceiving the clergy as anti-Nazi, and a \u201cgreat danger of the issue spilling over from a church affair into the political arena\u201d.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nHitler recognized that workers, through repeated strikes, might force approval of their demands and he made concessions to workers in order to preempt unrest; yet the rare but forceful public protests the regime faced were by women and Catholics, primarily. Some of the earliest work on resistance examined the Catholic record, including most spectacularly local and regional protests against decrees removing crucifixes from schools, part of the regime's effort to secularize public life.<ref>Neuh\u00e4ser, J. (1946) ''Kreuz und Hakenkreuz: Der Kampf des Nationalsozialismus gegen die katholische Kirche und der kirchliche Widerstand''. Munich: Katholische Kirche Bayerns. ASIN B0017W366U.</ref> Although historians dispute the degree of political antagonism toward National Socialism behind these protests, their impact is uncontested. Popular, public, improvised protests against decrees replacing crucifixes with the [[F\u00fchrer|F\u00fchrer's]] picture, in incidents from 1935 to 1941, from north to south and east to west in Germany, forced state and party leaders to back away and leave crucifixes in traditional places. Prominent incidents of crucifix removal decrees, followed by protests and official retreat, occurred in Oldenburg (Lower Saxony) in 1936, Frankenholz (Saarland) and Frauenberg (East Prussia) in 1937, and in Bavaria in 1941. Women, with traditional sway over children and their spiritual welfare, played a leading part.<ref>Kuropka, J. (1987) ''Das Kreuz: Untersuchungen zur Geschichte des Konflikts um Kreuz und Lutherbild in den Schulen Oldenburgs, zur Wirkungsgeschichte eines in einer agrarisch katholischen Region.''Aschendorff, M\u00fcnster: Oldenburgische Volkszeitung.</ref>\n\nGerman history of the early twentieth century held examples of the power of public mobilization, including the [[Kapp Putsch|Kapp military Putsch]] in 1920, some civilian Germans realized the specific potential of public protest from within the dictatorship. After the Oldenburg [[Crucifix Decrees|crucifix struggle]], police reported that Catholic activists told each other they could defeat future anti-Catholic actions of the state as long as they posed a united front''.'' Catholic Bishop [[Clemens August Graf von Galen|Clemens von Galen]] may well have been among them. He had raised his voice in the struggle, circulating a pastoral letter. A few months later in early 1937, while other bishops voiced fear of using such \u201cdirect confrontation,\u201d Galen favored selective \u201cpublic protests\u201d as a means of defending church traditions against an overreaching state<ref>Beth Griech-Polelle (2002, 1), ''Bishop von Galen: German Catholicism and National Socialism.''</ref>''.''\n\nSome argue that the regime, once at war, no longer heeded popular opinion and, some agencies and authorities did radicalize use of terror for domestic control in the final phase of war. Hitler and the regime's response to collective street protest, however, did not harden. Although a number of historians have argued that popular opinion, brought to a head by Galen's denunciations from the pulpit in the late summer of 1941, caused Hitler to suspend Nazi \u201c[[Euthanasia in Nazi Germany|Euthanasia]],\u201d others disagree. It is certain, however, that Galen intended to have an impact from the pulpit and that the highest Nazi officials decided against punishing him out of concern for public morale.<ref>E. D. R. Harrison (1994: 354), \u201cThe Nazi Dissolution of the Monasteries: A Case-Study,\u201d in''The English Historical Review'', 109, 431 (April).</ref> A Catholic protest in May the same year against the closing of the M\u00fcnsterschwarzach monastery in Lower Franconia illustrates the regime's occasional response of not meeting protester demands while nevertheless responding with \u201cflexibility\u201d and \u201cleniency\u201d rather than repressing or punishing protesters.<ref>Jonathan D\u00fcring, ''Wir weichen nur der Gewalt: Die M\u00f6nche von M\u00fcnsterschwarzach im Dritten Reich'', vol. 2, M\u00fcnsterschwarzach 1997.</ref> That protest, however, represented only local opinion rather than the nationwide anxiety Galen represented, stirred up by the Euthanasia program the regime refused to acknowledge.\n\nAnother indication that civilians realized the potential of public protest within a regime so concerned about morale and unity, is from [[Margarete Sommer]]s of the Catholic Welfare Office in the Berlin Diocese. Following the [[Rosenstrasse protest|Rosenstrasse Protest]] of late winter 1943. Sommers, who shared with colleagues an assumption that \u201cthe people could mobilize against the regime on behalf of specific values,\u201d wrote that the women had succeeded through \u201cloudly voiced protests\u201d.<ref>Leugers, A.

Police guards repeatedly scattered the women, gathered in groups of up to hundreds, with shouts of \u201cclear the street or we\u2019ll shoot.\u201d As the police repeatedly failed to shoot, some protesters began to think their action might prevail. One said that if she had first calculated whether a protest could have succeeded, she would have stayed home. Instead, \u201cwe acted from the heart,\u201d she said, adding that the women were capable of such courageous action because their husbands were in grave danger.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=Resistance of the heart : intermarriage and the Rosenstrasse protest in Nazi Germany|last=Nathan.|first=Stoltzfus|date=2001|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=0813529093|location=New Brunswick, N.J.|oclc=44764115}}</ref> Some 7,000 of the last Jews in Berlin arrested at this time were sent to Auschwitz.

Leugers (2004).</ref>\n\nAnother potential indication that German civilians realized the power of public protest was in [[Dortmund-H\u00f6rde station|Dortmund-H\u00f6rde]] in April 1943. According to an SD Report from July 8 of 1943, in the early afternoon of April 12, 1943, an army captain arrested a Flak soldier in Dortmund- H\u00f6rde because of an insolent salute. The townsfolk looking on took his side. A crowd formed of three to four hundred comprised essentially of women. The crowd shouted lines such as \u201cGebt uns unsere M\u00e4nner wieder\u201d or \u201cgive us our men back\u201d which suggest some in the crowd were aware of the protest on [[Rosenstrasse protest|Rosenstrassse]]. The recentness of the weeklong protest on Rosenstrasse strengthens this possibility. On Rosenstrasse the chant had been coined as the rallying cry of wives for their incarcerated husbands. Here on behalf of one man it made little sense.\n\n[[Rosenstrasse protest|Rosenstrasse]] was the only open, collective protest for Jews during the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]], and in the estimation of historians over the decades, it rescued some 2,000 intermarried Jews. They were \u201cfull\u201d Jews in the sense of the 1935 Nuremberg Laws and the Gestapo aimed to deport as many as it could without drawing attention to the Holocaust or alienating the \u201cracial\u201d public, according to.<ref>Stoltzfus (2005, 450-9) in Historical Evidence and Plausible History, ''Central European History 38 (3).''</ref> Auschwitz records show that SS officials were expecting additional laborers from Berlin, most likely those imprisoned at Rosenstrasse, just as the regime was intent on deporting the last Jews from German soil.<ref>Joachim Neander (2004: 196-202), \u201cDie Rosenstrasse von au\u00dfen gesehen\u2014Wechsel der Perspektiven,\u201d in A.

On October 11, 1943, some three hundred women protested on Adolf Hitler Square in the western German [[Ruhr (river)|Ruhr Valley]] city of [[Witten]] against the official decision to withhold their food ration cards unless they evacuated their homes. Under increasing [[Allied-occupied Germany|Allied]] bombardments, officials had struggled to establish an orderly program for evacuation.

In this context, ordinary Germans were sometimes able to exact limited concessions, as Goebbels worried that a growing number of Germans were becoming aware of the regime's soft spot represented by its response to protests.\n\n==Disorganized resistance==\n[[File:Ehrenfeld Gedenktafel Edelwei\u00dfpiraten.jpg|thumb|Memorial to the \"Edelweisspiraten\" youth group, six of whom were hanged in Cologne in 1944]]\n\nIt cannot be disputed that many Germans supported the regime until the end of the war. But beneath the surface of German society there were also currents of resistance, if not always consciously political. The German historian [[Detlev Peukert]], who pioneered the study of German society during the Nazi era, called this phenomenon \"everyday resistance.\" His research was based partly on the regular reports by the Gestapo and the SD on morale and public opinion, and on the \"Reports on Germany\" which were produced by the exiled SPD based on information from its underground network in Germany and which were acknowledged to be very well informed.\n\nPeukert and other writers have shown that the most persistent sources of dissatisfaction in Nazi Germany were the state of the economy and anger at the corruption of Nazi Party officials &mdash; although these rarely affected the personal popularity of Hitler himself. The Nazi regime is frequently credited with \"curing unemployment,\" but this was done mainly by conscription and rearmament &mdash; the civilian economy remained weak throughout the Nazi period. Although prices were fixed by law, wages remained low and there were acute shortages, particularly once the war started. To this after 1942 was added the acute misery caused by Allied air attacks on German cities. The high living and venality of Nazi officials such as [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] aroused increasing anger. The result was \"deep dissatisfaction among the population of all parts of the country, caused by failings in the economy, government intrusions into private life, disruption of accepted tradition and custom, and police-state controls.\"<ref>[[Gordon A. Craig]], ''New York Review of Books'', 12 July 1987 (reviewing Peukert's book ''Inside Nazi Germany'')</ref>\n\n[[Otto and Elise Hampel]] protested the regime by leaving postcards urging resistance (both passive and forceful) against the regime around Berlin. It took two years before they were caught, convicted and then put to death.\n\nOpposition based on this widespread dissatisfaction usually took \"passive\" forms &mdash; absenteeism, malingering, spreading rumours, trading on the black market, hoarding, avoiding various forms of state service such as donations to Nazi causes. But sometimes it took more active forms, such as warning people about to be arrested, hiding them or helping them to escape, or turning a blind eye to oppositionist activities. Among the industrial working class, where the underground SPD and KPD networks were always active, there were frequent if short-lived strikes. These were generally tolerated, at least before the outbreak of war, provided the demands of the strikers were purely economic and not political.\n\nAnother form of resistance was assisting the persecuted German Jews. By mid-1942 the deportation of German and Austrian Jews to the [[extermination camps]] in occupied Poland was well under way. It is argued by some writers that the great majority of Germans were indifferent to the fate of the Jews, and a substantial proportion actively supported the Nazi programme of extermination.<ref>Eric Johnson and Karl-Heinz Reuband, ''What We Knew: Terror, Mass Murder and Everyday Life in Nazi Germany'', chapter 13</ref> But a minority persisted in trying to help Jews, even in the face of serious risk to themselves and their families. This was most pronounced in Berlin, where the Gestapo and SS were headquartered, but also where thousands of non-Jewish Berliners, some with powerful connections, risked hiding their Jewish neighbors.<ref name=\"Gilbert 2004\">{{cite book | last=Gilbert | first=Martin | title=The Righteous: The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust | publisher=H.

In [[Wieblingen]] in Baden, [[Elisabeth von Thadden]], a private girls' school principal, disregarded official edicts and continued to enroll Jewish girls at her school until May 1941 when the school was nationalised and she was dismissed (she was executed in 1944, following the [[Frau Solf Tea Party]]). A Berlin Protestant Minister, [[Heinrich Gr\u00fcber]], organised the smuggling of Jews to the [[Netherlands]]. At the Foreign Office, Canaris conspired to send a number of Jews to Switzerland under various pretexts. It is estimated that 2,000 Jews were hidden in Berlin until the end of the war. [[Martin Gilbert]] has documented numerous cases of Germans and Austrians, including officials and Army officers, who saved the lives of Jews.<ref>Martin Gilbert, ''The Righteous: The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust'', chapters 8 and 9</ref>\n\n[[File:Rosenstrasse Berlin.jpg|thumb|Berlin's Rosenstrasse, where the only public protest against the deportation of German Jews took place in 1943]]\n\nThe [[Rosenstrasse protest]] of February 1943 was sparked by the arrest and threatened deportation to death camps of 1,800 Jewish men married to non-Jewish women. Before these men could be deported, their wives and other relatives rallied outside the building in Rosenstrasse where the men were held. About 6,000 people, mostly women, rallied in shifts in the winter cold for over a week. Eventually Himmler, worried about the effect on civilian morale, gave in and allowed the arrested men to be released. Some who had already been deported and were on their way to [[Auschwitz]] were brought back. There was no retaliation against the protesters, and most of the Jewish men survived.\n\nNazism had a powerful appeal to German youth, particularly middle-class youth, and German universities were strongholds of Nazism even before Hitler came to power. The [[Hitler Youth]] sought to mobilise all young Germans behind the regime, and apart from stubborn resistance in some rural Catholic areas, was generally successful in the first period of Nazi rule. After about 1938, however, persistent alienation among some sections of German youth began to appear. This rarely took the form of overt political opposition &mdash; the [[White Rose]] group was a striking exception, but was striking mainly for its uniqueness. Much more common was what would now be called \"dropping out\" &mdash; a passive refusal to take part in official youth culture and a search for alternatives. Although none of the unofficial youth groups amounted to a serious threat to the Nazi regime, and although they provided no aid or comfort to those groups within the German elite who were actively plotting against Hitler, they do serve to show that there were currents of opposition at other levels of German society.\n\nExamples were the so-called ''[[Edelweiss Pirates|Edelweisspiraten]]'' (\"Edelweiss Pirates\"), a loose network of working-class youth groups in a number of cities, who held unauthorised meetings and engaged in street fights with the Hitler Youth; the [[Leipzig Meuten|Meuten]] group in [[Leipzig]], a more politicised group with links to the KPD underground, which had more than a thousand members in the late 1930s; and, most notably, the ''[[Swing Kids|Swingjugend]]'', middle-class youth who met in secret clubs in Berlin and most other large cities to listen to [[Swing (genre)|swing]], [[jazz]] and other music deemed \"degenerate\" by the Nazi authorities. This movement, which involved distinctive forms of dress and gradually become more consciously political, became so popular that it provoked a crackdown: in 1941 Himmler ordered the arrest of Swing activists and had some sent to concentration camps.\n\nIn October 1944, as the American and British armies approached the western borders of Germany, there was a serious outbreak of disorder in the bomb-ravaged city of [[Cologne]], which had been largely evacuated. The ''Edelweisspiraten'' linked up with gangs of deserters, escaped prisoners and foreign workers, and the underground KPD network, to engage in looting and sabotage, and the assassination of Gestapo and Nazi Party officials. Explosives were stolen with the objective of blowing up the Gestapo headquarters. Himmler, fearing the resistance would spread to other cities as the Allied armies advanced into Germany, ordered a savage crackdown, and for days gunbattles raged in the ruined streets of Cologne. More than 200 people were arrested and dozens were hanged in public, among them six teenaged ''Edelweisspiraten'', including [[Bartholom\u00e4us Schink]].<ref>Ian Kershaw, ''Hitler 1936&ndash;1945: Nemesis'', 704</ref>\n\n==Relations with Allies==\nThe various groups of German resistance against the Nazi government had different attitudes to the Allies. The most visible resistance group of the July 20 plot wasn't interested in dealing with all the Allies, and pressed demands against such Allied countries as Poland and the Soviet Union; some of its members were involved in atrocities against people in these countries. In particular the July 20th plotters demanded in their proposals to occupy Poland and annex its territory, while occupying the rest of East Europe and continuing war with the Soviet Union. The token representative of the July 20 Group, Claus von Stauffenberg, was known for his support towards German colonization of Poland as well as racist remarks regarding Polish Jews.<ref name=\"Martyn\">{{Cite book | last=Housden | first=Martyn | title=Resistance and Conformity in the Third Reich | year=1997 | publisher=Routledge | location=New York  | isbn=978-0-415-12134-7 | pages=}} page 100: \"He was endorsing both the tyrannical occupation of Poland and the use of its people as slave labourers\"</ref><ref name=\"Hoffman\">{{cite book|author=Peter Hoffman |title=Stauffenberg: A Family History, 1905\u20131944|page=116|year=2003 |publisher=McGill-Queen's Press}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~semp/germans.htm|title=Germans against Hitler.

While English historians too have criticized the unconditional surrender, most of them agree that it had no real impact on the final outcome of the war.<ref>'Getting History Right' East and West German Collective Memories of the Holocaust and War, page 120, Mark Wolfgram, Lexington Books 2010</ref>\nPrior to the formulation of unconditional surrender by the Allies,  the peace demands sent from the German resistance were hardly satisfactory; for example in 1941 a proposal by Goerdeler demanded borders of 1914 with France, Belgium and Poland, as well as acceptance of annexation of Austria and Sudetenland.<ref name=\"'Getting History Right' page 120\">'Getting History Right' page 120</ref>\n\nWhile German popular memory and public discourse portrays the resistance as isolated due to demand of unconditional surrender, in reality its isolation was due to unrealistic expectations of what the Allies would accept; while German commentators write that the resistance tried \"to save that which remained to be saved\", they omit the fact that it included a significant portion of territories conquered by Nazi Germany from its neighbours.<ref name=\"'Getting History Right' page 120\"/>\n\nA [[SHAEF]] directive prohibited activities aimed at promoting German revolt against the Nazi regime.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.psupress.psu.edu/books/titles/0-271-02314-7.html |title=Arthur D.

On the contrary, they have again and again welded together the people and the Nazis by statements published, either out of indifference or with a purpose. To take a recent example, the Morgenthau plan gave Dr. Goebbels the best possible chance. He was able to prove to his countrymen, in black and white, that the enemy planned the enslavement of Germany. The conviction that Germany had nothing to expect from defeat but oppression and exploitation still prevails, and that accounts for the fact that the Germans continue to fight. It is not a question of a regime, but of the homeland itself, and to save that, every German is bound to obey the call, whether he be Nazi or member of the opposition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/psf/box32/t298m01.html|title=Home - FDR Presidential Library & Museum|publisher=}}</ref> </blockquote>\n\nOn 20 July 1945 &mdash; the first anniversary of the failed attempt to kill Hitler &mdash; no mention whatsoever was made of the event. This was because reminding the German population of the fact that there had been active German resistance to Hitler would undermine the Allied efforts to instill a sense of [[collective guilt]] in the German populace.<ref>Michael R.

Soldatengrab.jpg|thumb|upright|The grave of a German soldier, Heinz K\u00fchl, on the [[Kursk]] battlefield]]\nBy mid-1943 the tide of war was turning decisively against Germany. The last major German offensive on the Eastern Front, [[Battle of Kursk|Operation Citadel]], ended in the defeat for the Germans at [[Kursk]], and in July 1943 [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] was overthrown. The Army and civilian plotters became more convinced than ever that Hitler must be assassinated so that a government acceptable to the western Allies could be formed and a separate peace negotiated in time to prevent a Soviet invasion of Germany. This scenario, while more credible than some of the resistance's earlier plans, was based on a [[false premise]]: that the western Allies would be willing to break with Stalin and negotiate a separate peace with a non-Nazi German government. In fact both [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] were committed to the \u201cunconditional surrender\u201d formula.\n\nSince the Foreign Office was a stronghold of resistance activists, it was not difficult for the conspirators to reach the Allies via diplomats in neutral countries. Theo Kordt, based in the German Embassy in [[Bern]], and advised by the Foreign Officers resisters Ulrich von Hassell and Adam von Trott zu Solz, communicated with the British via intermediaries such as [[Willem Visser 't Hooft]], secretary-general of the [[World Council of Churches]], based in [[Geneva]]. The Kreisau Circle sent [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]] and Helmut von Moltke to meet [[George Bell (bishop)|George Bell]], [[Bishop of Chichester]], at a church conference in [[Stockholm]]. Bell passed their messages and plans on to Foreign Secretary [[Anthony Eden]]. An American journalist, [[Louis P. Lochner]], carried coded messages out of Germany and took them to Roosevelt. Other envoys worked through Vatican channels, or via diplomats in [[Lisbon]] \u2013 a recognised site for indirect communication between Germany and the Allied countries.\n\nAll of these overtures were rejected, and indeed they were usually simply ignored. The western Allies would give the German resistance no assistance or even recognition. There were several reasons for this. First, they did not know or trust the resisters, who seemed to them to be a clique of Prussian reactionaries concerned mainly to save their own skins now that Germany was losing the war. This attitude was encouraged by visceral anti-Germans such as [[Robert Gilbert Vansittart|Lord Vansittart]], Churchill's diplomatic adviser, who regarded all Germans as evil. Second, Roosevelt and Churchill were both acutely aware that the Soviet Union was bearing the brunt of the war against Hitler, and were aware of Stalin's constant suspicions that they were doing deals behind his back. They thus refused any discussions that might be seen as suggesting a willingness to reach a separate peace with Germany. Third, the Allies were determined that in [[World War II]], unlike in [[World War I]], Germany must be comprehensively defeated in the field so that another [[Dolchstosslegende|\"stab in the back\" myth]] would not to arise in Germany.\n\nOlbricht now put forward a new strategy for staging a coup against Hitler. The Reserve Army had an operational plan called Operation Valkyrie, which was to be used if the disruption caused by the Allied bombing of German cities caused a breakdown in law and order, or a rising by the millions of slave labourers from occupied countries now being used in German factories. Olbricht suggested that this plan could be used to mobilise the Reserve Army to stage a coup. In the autumn of 1943, Tresckow revised Valkyrie plan and drafted supplemental orders to take control of German cities, disarm the SS and arrest the Nazi leadership after Hitler's assassination. Operation Valkyrie could only be put into effect by General [[Friedrich Fromm]], commander of the Reserve Army, so he must either be won over to the conspiracy or in some way neutralised if the plan was to succeed. Fromm, like many senior officers, knew about the military conspiracies against Hitler but neither supported them nor reported them to the Gestapo.\n\n[[File:Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg - Helmuth James Graf von Moltke.jpg|thumb|A German stamp of [[Claus von Stauffenberg|Claus Philipp Maria Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg]] and [[Helmuth James Graf von Moltke]] in commemoration of their 100th birthdays]]\n\nIn August 1943 Tresckow met a young staff officer, Colonel [[Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg]], for the first time. Badly wounded in North Africa, Stauffenberg was a devout Catholic, a political conservative and a zealous German nationalist with a taste for philosophy. He had at first welcomed the Nazi regime but had become rapidly disillusioned. By 1942 he shared the widespread conviction among Army officers that Germany was being led to disaster and that Hitler must be removed from power. For some time his religious scruples had prevented him from coming to the conclusion that assassination was the correct way to achieve this. After Stalingrad, however, he decided that ''not'' assassinating Hitler would be a greater moral evil.\n\nDuring late 1943 and early 1944 there were a series of attempts to get one of the military conspirators near enough to Hitler for long enough to kill him with a bomb or a revolver. But the task was becoming increasingly difficult. As the war situation deteriorated, Hitler no longer appeared in public and rarely visited Berlin. He spent most of his time at his headquarters in East Prussia, with occasional breaks at his Bavarian mountain retreat in [[Berchtesgaden]]. In both places he was heavily guarded and rarely saw people he did not already know and trust. Himmler and the Gestapo were increasingly suspicious of plots against Hitler, and specifically suspected the officers of the General Staff, which was indeed the place where most of the young officers willing to sacrifice themselves to kill Hitler were located. All these attempts therefore failed, sometimes by a matter of minutes.\n\n<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:JuliusLeber.jpg|thumb|[[Julius Leber]]]] -->\nFurther blows came in January and February 1944 when first Moltke and then Canaris were arrested. By the summer of 1944 the Gestapo was closing in on the conspirators. On 4 July [[Julius Leber]], who was trying to establish contact between his own underground SPD network and the KPD's network in the interests of the \u201cunited front,\u201d was arrested after attending a meeting which had been infiltrated by the Gestapo. There was a sense that time was running out, both on the battlefield, where the eastern front was in full retreat and where the Allies had landed in France on [[D-Day|6 June]], and in Germany, where the resistance's room for manoeuvre was rapidly contracting. The belief that this was the last chance for action seized the conspirators. Few now believed that the Allies would agree to a separate peace with a non-Nazi government, even if Hitler was assassinated. Leber in particular had argued that \u201cunconditional surrender\u201d was inevitable and the only question was whether it would be before or after the Soviets invaded Germany.\n\nBy this time the core of the conspirators had begun to think of themselves as doomed men, whose actions were more symbolic than real. The purpose of the conspiracy was seen by some of them as saving the honour of themselves, their families, the Army and Germany through a grand, if futile, gesture, rather than altering the course of history. Tresckow said to Stauffenberg through one of his aides, Lieutenant [[Heinrich Graf von Lehndorff-Steinort]]: \u201cThe assassination must be attempted, ''co\u00fbte que co\u00fbte'' [whatever the cost]. Even if it fails, we must take action in Berlin. For the practical purpose no longer matters; what matters now is that the German resistance movement must take the plunge before the eyes of the world and of history. Compared to that, nothing else matters.\u201d<ref>Graefin-Doenhoff, \"Um der Ehre Willen: Erinnerungen an die Freunde vom 20. Juli\", 72</ref><ref>Joachim Fest, ''Plotting Hitler\u2019s Death: The German Resistance to Hitler 1933&ndash;1945'', 236</ref>\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146III-347, Werner Karl v. Haeften.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Werner von Haeften|Werner Karl von Haeften]]]]\n\nIn retrospect it is surprising that these months of plotting by the resistance groups in the Army and the state apparatus, in which dozens of people were involved and of which many more, including very senior Army officers, were aware, apparently totally escaped the attentions of the Gestapo. In fact, as was noted earlier, the Gestapo had known since February 1943 of both the Abwehr resistance group under the patronage of Canaris and of the Goedeler-Beck circle. If all these people had been arrested and interrogated, the Gestapo might well have uncovered the group based in Army Group Centre as well and the July 20 assassination attempt would never have happened. This raises the possibility that Himmler knew about the plot and, for reasons of his own, allowed it to go ahead.\n\nHimmler had had at least one conversation with a known oppositionist when, in August 1943, the Prussian Finance Minister Johannes Popitz came to see him and offered him the support of the opposition if he would make a move to displace Hitler and secure a negotiated end to the war.<ref>Joachim Fest, ''Plotting Hitler's Death'', 228</ref> Nothing came of this meeting, but Popitz was not arrested and Himmler apparently did nothing to track down the resistance network which he knew was operating within the state bureaucracy. It is possible that Himmler, who by late 1943 knew that the war was unwinnable, allowed the July 20 plot to go ahead in the knowledge that if it succeeded he would be Hitler's successor, and could then lead to a peace settlement. Popitz was not alone in seeing in Himmler a potential ally. General von Bock advised Tresckow to seek his support, but there is no evidence that he did so. Gordeler was apparently also in indirect contact with Himmler via a mutual acquaintance [[Carl Langbehn]]. Canaris's biographer [[Heinz H\u00f6hne]] suggests that Canaris and Himmler were working together to bring about a change of regime. All of this remains speculation.<ref>Himmler's contacts with the opposition and his possible motives are discussed by Peter Padfield, ''Himmler'', 419&ndash;424</ref>\n\nHimmler in fact knew more about the real level of opposition to the Nazi regime than did the opposition itself. To the resistance activists it seemed that the German people continued to place their faith in Hitler no matter how dire the military and economic situation had become. But Himmler was receiving regular reports from the [[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]] (Security Service, the intelligence arm of the SS), about the real state of German morale. These were compiled by SS-Gruppenf\u00fcher [[Otto Ohlendorf]] and were drawn from the SD's wide range of contacts all over Germany. They showed a sharp decline in civilian morale and in the level of support for the Nazi regime, beginning after Stalingrad and accelerating through 1943 as the military setbacks continued, the economic situation deteriorated and the Allied bombing of German cities grew more intense. By the end of 1943 Himmler knew that most Germans no longer believed that war could be won and that many, perhaps a majority, had lost faith in Hitler.<ref>Peter Padfield, ''Himmler'', 419</ref> But fear of the Gestapo meant that this disillusionment did not translate into political opposition to the regime &mdash; even though, as the [[Rosenstrasse protest]] showed, it was possible even as late as 1943 for courageous opponents of Nazi policies to make public and successful protests.\n\nNevertheless, organised resistance begun to stir during 1944. While the SPD and KPD trade unions had been destroyed in 1933, the Catholic unions had voluntarily dissolved along with the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]]. As a result, Catholic unionists had been less zealously repressed than their socialist counterparts, and had maintained an informal network of activists. Their leaders, [[Jakob Kaiser]] and Max Habermann, judged by the beginning of 1944 that it was time to take action. They organised a network of resistance cells in government offices across Germany, ready to rise and take control of their buildings when the word was given by the military that Hitler was dead.\n\n==20 July plot==\n{{Main|20 July plot}}\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| footer    = {{FIAV|proposal}} Two variants of [[Josef Wirmer]]'s 1944 \"Resistance\" design, created by his brother, Ernst.

This position enabled Stauffenberg to attend Hitler's military conferences, either in East Prussia or at Berchtesgaden, and would thus give him a golden opportunity, perhaps the last that would present itself, to kill Hitler with a bomb or a pistol. Conspirators who had long resisted on moral grounds the idea of killing Hitler now changed their minds \u2013 partly because they were hearing reports of the mass murder at [[Auschwitz]] of up to 400,000 Hungarian Jews, the culmination of the Nazi [[Holocaust]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Meanwhile, new key allies had been gained. These included General [[Carl-Heinrich von St\u00fclpnagel]], the German military commander in France, who would take control in Paris when Hitler was killed and, it was hoped, negotiate an immediate armistice with the invading Allied armies. The demands of the plotters regarding armistice with Allies included Germany retaining its 1914 eastern borders, including the Polish territories of [[Wielkopolska]] and [[Pozna\u0144]].<ref>\"Review of 'Claus Graf Stauffenberg. 15.

Carsten ''International Affairs'', Vol. 43, No. 2 (April 1967). \"It is more surprising that, as late as May 1944, Stauffenberg still demanded for Germany the frontiers of 1914 in the east, i.e., a new partition of Poland.\"</ref> Other demands included keeping such territorial gains as [[Austria]] and the [[Sudetenland]] within the Reich, giving autonomy to [[Alsace-Lorraine]], and even expansion of the current wartime borders of Germany in the south by annexing Tyrol as far as [[Bolzano]] and [[Merano]]. Non-territorial demands included such points as refusal of any occupation of Germany by the Allies, as well as refusal to hand over war criminals by demanding the right of \"nations to deal with their own criminals\". These proposals were only directed to the Western Allies \u2013 Stauffenberg wanted Germany only to retreat from western, southern and northern positions, while demanding the right to continue military occupation of German territorial gains in the east.<ref name=\"Martyn2\">Martyn Housden,\"Resistance and Conformity in the Third Reich\";Routledge 1997;page 109\u2013110</ref>\n\nThe plot was now as ready as it would ever be. Twice in early July Stauffenberg attended Hitler's conferences carrying a bomb in his briefcase. But because the conspirators had decided that Himmler, too, must be assassinated if the planned mobilisation of Operation Valkyrie was to have any chance of success, he had held back at the last minute because Himmler was not present \u2013 in fact it was unusual for Himmler to attend military conferences. By 15 July, when Stauffenberg again flew to East Prussia, this condition had been dropped. The plan was for Stauffenberg to plant the briefcase with the bomb in Hitler's conference room with a timer running, excuse himself from the meeting, wait for the explosion, then fly back to Berlin and join the other plotters at the Bendlerblock. Operation Valkyrie would be mobilised, the Reserve Army would take control of Germany and the other Nazi leaders would be arrested. Beck would be appointed head of state, [[Carl Friedrich Goerdeler|Goerdeler]] Chancellor and [[Erwin von Witzleben|Witzleben]] commander-in-chief. The plan was ambitious and depended on a run of very good luck, but it was not totally fanciful.\n\n==Rastenburg==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1972-025-10, Hitler-Attentat, 20.

Stauffenberg, depressed and angry, returned to Berlin. On 18 July rumours reached him that the Gestapo had wind of the conspiracy and that he might be arrested at any time \u2013 this was apparently not true, but there was a sense that the net was closing in and that the next opportunity to kill Hitler must be taken because there might not be another. At 10:00 hours on 20 July Stauffenberg flew back to the [[Wolfsschanze]] for another Hitler military conference, again with a bomb in his briefcase. It is remarkable in retrospect that despite Hitler's mania for security, officers attending his conferences were not searched.\n\nAt about 12:10 the conference began. Stauffenberg, having previously activated the timer on the bomb, placed his briefcase under the table around which Hitler and more than 20 officers were seated or standing. After ten minutes, he made an excuse and left the room. At 12:40 the bomb went off, demolishing the conference room. Several officers were killed, but not Hitler. Possibly he had been saved because the heavy oak leg of the conference table, behind which Stauffenberg's briefcase had been left, deflected the blast. But Stauffenberg, seeing the building collapse in smoke and flame, assumed Hitler was dead, leapt into a staff car and made a dash for the airfield before the alarm could be raised. By 13:00 he was airborne.\n\nBy the time Stauffenberg's plane reached Berlin at about 15:00, General [[Erich Fellgiebel]], an officer at Rastenburg who was in on the plot, had rung the Bendlerblock and told the plotters that Hitler had survived the explosion. This was a fatal step (literally so for Fellgiebel and many others), because the Berlin plotters immediately lost their nerve, and judged, probably correctly, that the plan to mobilise Operation Valkyrie would have no chance of succeeding once the officers of the Reserve Army knew that Hitler was alive. There was more confusion when Stauffenberg's plane landed and he phoned from the airport to say that Hitler was dead. The Bendlerblock plotters did not know whom to believe. Finally at 16:00 Olbricht issued the orders for Operation Valkyrie to be mobilised. The vacillating General Fromm, however, phoned Keitel, who assured him that Hitler was alive, and demanded to know Stauffenberg's whereabouts. This told Fromm that the plot had been traced to his headquarters<!---how? did keitel ask where stuaffenburg was, or did fromm?--->, and that he was in mortal danger.\n\nAt 16:40 Stauffenberg arrived at the Bendlerblock. Fromm now changed sides and attempted to have Stauffenberg arrested, but Olbricht and Stauffenberg restrained him at gunpoint. By this time Himmler had taken charge of the situation and has issued orders countermanding Olbricht's mobilisation of Operation Valkyrie. In many places the coup was going ahead, led by officers who believed that Hitler was dead. The Propaganda Ministry on the [[Wilhelmstrasse]], with [[Joseph Goebbels]] inside, was surrounded by troops. In Paris St\u00fclpnagel issued orders for the arrest of the SS and [[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]] commanders. In Vienna, Prague and many other places troops occupied Nazi Party offices and arrested Gauleiters and SS officers.\n\nThe decisive moment came at 19:00, when Hitler was sufficiently recovered to make phone calls. By phone he personally empowered a loyal officer, Major [[Otto Remer]], to regain control of the situation in Berlin. At 20:00 a furious Witzleben arrived at the Bendlerblock and had a bitter argument with Stauffenberg, who was still insisting that the coup could go ahead. Witzleben left shortly afterwards. At around this time the planned seizure of power in Paris was aborted when Kluge, who had recently been appointed commander-in-chief in the west, learned that Hitler was alive, changed sides with alacrity and had St\u00fclpnagel arrested.\n[[File:Excavated cells from the basement of the Gestapo headquarters.jpg|thumb|The cells of the Gestapo headquarters in Prinz-Albrecht-Strasse, where many of the July 20 plotters and other resistance activists were tortured]]\n\nThe less resolute members of the conspiracy in Berlin also now began to change sides. Fighting broke out in the Bendlerblock between officers supporting and opposing the coup, and Stauffenberg was wounded. By 23:00 Fromm had regained control, hoping by a show of zealous loyalty to save his own skin. Beck, realising the game was up, shot himself \u2013 the first of many suicides in the coming days. Fromm declared that he had convened a court-martial consisting of himself, and had sentenced Olbricht, Stauffenberg and two other officers to death. At 00:10 on 21 July they were shot in the courtyard outside. Others would have been executed as well, but at 00:30 the SS led by [[Otto Skorzeny]] arrived on the scene and further executions were forbidden. The original order given to Otto Remer from Adolf Hitler was to capture the conspirators of the resistance alive. Fromm went off to see Goebbels to claim credit for suppressing the coup. He was immediately arrested.\n\nThat was the end of the German resistance. Over the coming weeks Himmler's Gestapo, driven by a furious Hitler, rounded up nearly everyone who had had the remotest connection with the July 20 plot. The discovery of letters and diaries in the homes and offices of those arrested revealed the plots of 1938, 1939 and 1943, and this led to further rounds of arrests, including that of Halder, who finished the war in a concentration camp. Under Himmler's new [[Sippenhaft]] (blood guilt) laws, all the relatives of the principal plotters were also arrested. Many people killed themselves, including Tresckow, St\u00fclpnagel, Kluge and Rommel (under Hitler's orders).\n\nVery few of the plotters tried to escape, or to deny their guilt when arrested. It was as if they felt that now that honour had been satisfied, there was nothing further to be done. Hassell, who was at home in Bavaria, returned to his office in Berlin and awaited arrest. Others turned themselves in. Some plotters did manage to get away \u2013 Gisevius to Switzerland, for example. Others survived by luck or accident. It appears that none of the conspirators implicated anyone else, even under torture. It was well into August before the Gestapo learned of the Kreisau Circle. Goerdeler was not arrested until August 12.\n\nThose who survived interrogation were given perfunctory trials before the People's Court and its bullying Nazi judge [[Roland Freisler]]. Eventually some 5,000 people were arrested and about 200 were executed<ref>Ian Kershaw, ''Hitler 1936&ndash;1945: Nemesis'', 693</ref> \u2013 not all of them connected with the July 20 plot, since the Gestapo used the occasion to settle scores with many other people suspected of opposition sympathies. After February 3, 1945, when [[Roland Freisler#Death|Freisler was killed]] in [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II#The largest American raid on Berlin|an American air raid]], there were no more formal trials, but as late as April, with the war weeks away from its end, Canaris's diary was found, and many more people were implicated. Executions continued down to the last days of the war.\n\n==Aktion Rheinland==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2019}}\n{{main|Aktion Rheinland}}\nOne of the final acts of resistance was ''Aktion Rheinland'', an operation carried out by the resistance group in [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] led by Karl August Wiedenhofen. The goal was to surrender the city of D\u00fcsseldorf to the advancing [[US Army|Americans]] without any fighting, thereby preventing further destruction. The action occurred during the latter stages of the [[encirclement]] of the [[Ruhr Pocket]], with Wiedenhofen's group briefly taking over police headquarters on 16 April 1945. Despite the plan being betrayed (leading to the execution of five Resistance fighters), other fighters managed to reach American lines, leading to the virtually bloodless capture of the city on 17 April.\n\n==Historiography==\n[[File:Heinrich Vogeler-Das Dritte Reich-1934.jpg|thumbnail|150px|\"The Third Reich\", 1934 painting by the anti-Nazi exile German painter [[Heinrich Vogeler]].]]\n{{Main|Historiography of German resistance to Nazism}}\nHistoriographical debates on the subject on ''Widerstand'' have often featured intense arguments about the nature, extent and effectiveness of resistance in the Third Reich.<ref name=\":1\">Kershaw, Ian ''The Nazi Dictatorship Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation'', London: Arnold Press, 2000 pages 183&ndash;184.</ref> In particular, debate has focused around what to define as ''Widerstand'' (resistance).<ref>Kershaw, Ian ''The Nazi Dictatorship Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation'', London: Arnold Press, 2000 page 184.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Germans who resisted Nazism]]\n* [[List of members of the 20 July plot]]\n* [[Aktion Rheinland]], D\u00fcsseldorf, April 1945.\n* [[Georg Elser]]\n* [[Hermann Braun]] (former [[Nazi]] [[propaganda]] [[film actor]])\n* [[Werner Dankwort]]\n* [[Helmuth H\u00fcbener]]\n* [[Friedrich Kellner]]\n* [[Hugo Launicke]]\n* [[Kurt Nehrling]]\n* [[Friedrich Olbricht]]\n* [[Claus von Stauffenberg]]\n* [[Friedrich Schlotterbeck]]\n* [[Oskar Schindler]]\n* [[Chiune Sugihara]]\n* [[Red Orchestra (espionage)|Red Orchestra]]\n* [[Rudolf Christoph Freiherr von Gersdorff]]\n* [[Robert Uhrig]]\n* [[Schwarze Kapelle]]\n* [[Italian resistance movement]]\n* [[Japanese dissidence during the early Sh\u014dwa period|Japanese dissidence during the early Showa period]]\n* [[Jesuits and Nazi Germany]]\n* [[Austrian Resistance|Austrian Resistance during Nazism, WW II & before]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n;General\n* Harold C.

Many of these Germans had served in government, the military, or in civil positions, which enabled them to engage in [[subversion]] and conspiracy; in addition, the Canadian historian Peter Hoffman counts unspecified \"tens of thousands\" in [[Nazi concentration camps]] who were either suspected of or actually engaged in opposition.<ref>Peter Hoffmann \"The History of the German Resistance, 1933&ndash;1945\"p.xiii</ref> By contrast, the German historian [[Hans Mommsen]] wrote that resistance in Germany was \"resistance without the people\" and that the number of those Germans engaged in resistance to the Nazi regime was very small.<ref>Mommsen, Hans \"German Society and the Resistance Against Hitler\" pages 255-273 from ''The Third Reich The Essential Readings'' edited by Christian Leitz, Blackwell: London, 1999 pages 259-262.</ref>  The resistance in Germany included German citizens of non-German ethnicity, such as members of the Polish minority who formed resistance groups like [[Olimp (organization)|Olimp]].<ref>{{citation | url=http://wroclaw.gazeta.pl/wroclaw/1,35771,4203914.html | title=Ho\u0142d dla polskich patriot\u00f3w z Breslau | work=Gazeta Wroclaw| first=Beata | last= Maciejewska | date= 5 June 2007 | accessdate=14 July 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Introduction==\nThe German opposition and resistance movements consisted of disparate political and ideological strands, which represented different classes of German society and were seldom able to work together \u2013 indeed for much of the period there was little or no contact between the different strands of resistance.

Their stance was symbolically significant. The churches, as institutions, did not openly advocate for the overthrow of the Nazi state, but they remained one of the very few German institutions to retain some independence from the state, and were thus able to continue to co-ordinate a level of opposition to Government policies. They resisted the regime's efforts to intrude on ecclesiastical autonomy, but from the beginning, a minority of clergymen expressed broader reservations about the new order, and gradually their criticisms came to form a \"coherent, systematic critique of many of the teachings of National Socialism\".<ref name=\"Theodore S.

These were the special focus of the Gestapo. Because their common goal - the overthrow of the Nazi regime, the re-establishment of an independent Austria under Habsburg leadership - was a special provocation for the Nazi regime. Especially because Hitler bristled with hatred of the Habsburg family. Hitler diametrically rejected the centuries-old Habsburg principles of \"live and let live\" with regard to ethnic groups, peoples, minorities, religions, cultures and languages.<ref>Timothy Snyder \"The Red Prince: The Secret Lives of a Habsburg Archduke\" (2008).</ref><ref>James Longo \"Hitler and the Habsburgs: The Fuhrer's Vendetta Against the Austrian Royals\" (2018).</ref><ref>Bob Carruthers \"Hitler's Violent Youth: How Trench Warfare and Street Fighting Moulded Hitler\" (2015).</ref><ref>On Habsburg and the diversity of religions: Pieter M.

As a unique attempt in the German Reich to act aggressively against the Nazi state or the Gestapo, their plans regarding the later executed [[Karl Burian]] to blow up the Gestapo headquarters in Vienna apply. The Catholic resistance group, led by [[Heinrich Maier]], wanted to revive a Habsburg monarchy after the war on the one hand, and very successfully passed on plans and production sites for [[V-2 rocket]]s, [[Tiger tank]]s and aircraft to the Allies. From the fall of 1943 at least, these transmissions informed the Allies about the exact site plans of German production plants. With the location sketches of the manufacturing facilities, the Allied bombers were given precise air strikes. In contrast to many other German resistance groups, the Maier Group informed very early about the mass murder of Jews through their contacts with the Semperit factory near Auschwitz - a message the Americans in Zurich initially did not believe in the scope of.<ref>Elisabeth Boeckl-Klamper, Thomas Mang, Wolfgang Neugebauer: ''Gestapo-Leitstelle Wien 1938\u20131945.''

For example, in an Volksgerichtshof trial in Vienna, an old, seriously ill and frail woman was sentenced to 4 years in prison for possessing a self-written note found in her wallet with the rhymed text \"Wir wollen einen Kaiser von Gottesgnaden und keinen Blutm\u00f6rder aus Berchtesgaden.

This organized regular demonstrations and marches and published weekly publications. In the USA there were also the \u201cAustrian American League\u201d as pro-Habsburg organizations. [[Otto von Habsburg]] strongly opposed the Nazi regime. On the one hand, Habsburg provided thousands of refugees with the rescue visas and, on the other, made politics for the peoples of Central Europe with the Allies.

More than 300 Germans have been recognised for this.<ref>Martin Gilbert, ''The Righteous: The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust'', 181</ref> It also included, particularly in the later years of the regime, informal networks of young Germans who evaded serving in the [[Hitler Youth]] and defied the cultural policies of the Nazis in various ways.\n\nThe German Army, the Foreign Office and the ''[[Abwehr]]'', the military intelligence organization became sources for plots against Hitler in 1938 and again in 1939, but for a variety of reasons could not implement their plans. After the German defeat in the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] in 1943, they contacted many army officers who were convinced that Hitler was leading Germany to disaster, although fewer who were willing to engage in overt resistance. Active resisters in this group were frequently drawn from members of the [[Prussia]]n aristocracy.\n\nAlmost every community in Germany had members taken away to concentration camps. As early as 1935 there were jingles warning:\n\"Dear Lord God, keep me quiet, so that I don't end up in Dachau.\" (It almost rhymes in German:  ''Lieber Herr Gott mach mich stumm / Da\u00df ich nicht nach Dachau komm.'')<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=2770938|title=German Reactions to Nazi Atrocities|first=Morris|last=Janowitz|date=1 January 1946|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=52|issue=2|pages=141\u2013146|doi=10.1086/219961|pmid=20994277|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/03085c6d94f9a4128e99caa88b65556e14a172e3}}</ref>  \"Dachau\" refers to the [[Dachau concentration camp]].

The failures of the [[Weimar Republic]] had discredited democracy in the eyes of most Germans. Hitler's apparent success in restoring full employment after the ravages of the [[Great Depression]] (achieved mainly through the reintroduction of [[conscription]], a policy advocating that women stay home and raise children, a crash re-armament programme, and the incremental removal of Jews from the workforce as their jobs were tendered to Gentiles), and his bloodless foreign policy successes such as the [[reoccupation of the Rhineland]] in 1936 and the [[annexation of Austria]] in 1938, brought him almost universal acclaim.<ref name=shirer/>\n\nDuring this period, the SPD and the KPD managed to maintain underground networks, although the legacy of pre-1933 conflicts between the two parties meant that they were unable to co-operate. The [[Gestapo]] frequently infiltrated these networks, and the rate of arrests and executions of SPD and KPD activists was high, but the networks continued to be able recruit new members from the industrial working class, who resented the stringent labour discipline imposed by the regime during its race to rearm. The [[Sopade|exiled SPD leadership]] in [[Prague]] received and published accurate reports of events inside Germany. But beyond maintaining their existence and fomenting industrial unrest, sometimes resulting in short-lived strikes, these networks were able to achieve little.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=u5XzVzhiptQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=KPD+resistance+nazi#v=onepage&q=KPD%20resistance%20nazi&f=false|title=Circles of Resistance: Jewish, Leftist, and Youth Dissidence in Nazi Germany|last=Cox|first=John M.|date=2009|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=9781433105579|location=|pages=33\u201336|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThere remained, however, a substantial base for opposition to Hitler's regime. Although the Nazi Party had taken control of the German state, it had not destroyed and rebuilt the state apparatus in the way the [[Bolshevik]] regime had done in the [[Soviet Union]]. Institutions such as the Foreign Office, the intelligence services and, above all, the army, retained some measure of independence, while outwardly submitting to the new regime. In May 1934, Colonel-General [[Ludwig Beck]], Chief of Staff of the Army, had offered to resign if preparations were made for an offensive war against Czechoslovakia.<ref>''History of the German Resistance, 1933-1945'', Peter Hoffman, pg 38</ref> The independence of the army was eroded in 1938, when both the War Minister, General [[Werner von Blomberg]], and the Army Chief, General [[Werner von Fritsch]], were removed from office, but an informal network of officers critical of the Nazi regime remained.<ref name=\"shirer\" />\n\nIn 1936, thanks to an informer, the Gestapo raids devastated [[anarcho-syndicalism|Anarcho-syndicalist]] groups all over Germany, resulting in the arrest of 89 people.

The groups had been encouraging strikes, printing and distributing anti-Nazi propaganda and recruiting people to fight the Nazis' fascist allies during the [[Spanish Civil War]].<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nAs part of the agreement with the conservative forces by which Hitler became chancellor in 1933, the non-party conservative [[Konstantin von Neurath]] remained foreign minister, a position he retained until 1938. During Neurath's time in control, the Foreign Office with its network of diplomats and access to intelligence, became home to a circle of resistance, under the discreet patronage of the Under-Secretary of State [[Ernst von Weizs\u00e4cker]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The nemesis of power : the German Army in politics, 1918-1945|last=1902-1975.|first=Wheeler-Bennett, John Wheeler, Sir|date=2005|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|others=Overy, R.

They recognised that it was impossible to stage any kind of open political resistance. This was not, as is sometimes stated, because the repressive apparatus of the regime was so all-pervasive that public protest was impossible \u2013 as was shown when Catholics protested against the removal of crucifixes from Oldenburg schools in 1936, and the regime backed down. Rather it was because of Hitler's massive support among the German people. While resistance movements in the occupied countries could mobilise patriotic sentiment against the German occupiers, in Germany the resistance risked being seen as unpatriotic, particularly in wartime. Even many army officers and officials who detested Hitler had a deep aversion to being involved in \"subversive\" or \"treasonous\" acts against the government.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAs early as 1936, Oster and Gisevius came to the view that a regime so totally dominated by one man could only be brought down by eliminating that man \u2013 either by assassinating Hitler or by staging an army coup against him. However, it was a long time before any significant number of Germans came to accept this view. Many clung to the belief that Hitler could be persuaded to moderate his regime, or that some other more moderate figure could replace him. Others argued that Hitler was not to blame for the regime's excesses, and that the removal of [[Heinrich Himmler]] and reduction in the power of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] was needed. Some oppositionists were devout Christians who disapproved of assassination as a matter of principle. Others, particularly the army officers, felt bound by the [[Hitler oath|personal oath of loyalty they had taken to Hitler]] in 1934.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe opposition was also hampered by a lack of agreement about their objectives other than the need to remove Hitler from power. Some oppositionists were liberals who opposed the ideology of the Nazi regime in its entirety, and who wished to restore a system of parliamentary [[democracy]]. Most of the army officers and many of the civil servants, however, were conservatives and nationalists, and many had initially supported Hitler's policies \u2013 [[Carl Goerdeler]], the Lord Mayor of [[Leipzig]], was a good example. Some favored restoring the [[Hohenzollern dynasty]], while others favored an authoritarian, but not Nazi, regime. Some saw no problem with Hitler's anti-Semitism and ultra-nationalism, and opposed only his apparent reckless determination to take Germany into a new world war. Because of their many differences, the opposition was unable to form a united movement, or to send a coherent message to potential allies outside Germany.<ref name=\"shirer\" />\n\n==Role of the churches==\nThough neither the Catholic nor Protestant churches as institutions were prepared to openly oppose the Nazi State, it was from the clergy that the first major component of the German Resistance to the policies of the Third Reich emerged, and the churches as institutions provided the earliest and most enduring centres of systematic opposition to Nazi policies.

Hamerow, could indirectly \"articulate political dissent in the guise of pastoral stricture\". They usually spoke out not against the established system, but \"only against specific policies that it had mistakenly adopted and that it should therefore properly correct\".<ref>Theodore S.

This was the programme of so-called \u201c[[euthanasia]]\u201d \u2013 in fact a campaign of mass murder \u2013 directed at people with mental illness and/or severe physical disabilities which had begun in 1939 under the code name [[T-4 Euthanasia Program|T4]]. By 1941, more than 70,000 people had been killed under this programme, many by gassing, and their bodies incinerated. This policy aroused strong opposition across German society, and especially among Catholics. Opposition to the policy sharpened after the German attack on the [[Soviet Union]] in June 1941, because the war in the east produced for the first time large-scale German casualties, and the hospitals and asylums began to fill up with maimed and disabled young German soldiers. Rumours began to circulate that these men would also be subject to \u201ceuthanasia,\u201d although no such plans existed.\n\nCatholic anger was further fuelled by actions of the [[Gauleiter]] of [[Upper Bavaria]], [[Adolf Wagner]], a militantly anti-Catholic Nazi, who in June 1941 ordered the removal of crucifixes from all schools in his Gau. This attack on Catholicism provoked the first public demonstrations against government policy since the Nazis had come to power, and the mass signing of petitions, including by Catholic soldiers serving at the front. When Hitler heard of this he ordered Wagner to rescind his decree, but the damage had been done \u2013 German Catholics had learned that the regime could be successfully opposed. This led to more outspoken protests against the \u201ceuthanasia\u201d programme.\n\nIn July, the [[Bishop of M\u00fcnster]], [[Clemens August Graf von Galen]] (an old aristocratic conservative, like many of the anti-Hitler army officers), publicly denounced the \u201ceuthanasia\u201d programme in a sermon, and telegrammed his text to Hitler, calling on \u201cthe F\u00fchrer to defend the people against the Gestapo.\u201d Another Bishop, [[Franz Bornewasser]] of [[Trier]], also sent protests to Hitler, though not in public. On 3 August, Galen was even more outspoken, broadening his attack to include the Nazi persecution of religious orders and the closing of Catholic institutions. Local Nazis asked for Galen to be arrested, but Propaganda Minister [[Joseph Goebbels]] told Hitler that if this happened there would be an open revolt in Westphalia. Galen's sermons went further than defending the church, he spoke of a moral danger to Germany from the regime's violations of basic human rights: \"the right to life, to inviolability, and to freedom is an indispensable part of any moral social order\", he said - and any government that punishes without court proceedings \"undermines its own authority and respect for its sovereignty  within the conscience of its citizens\".<ref>Theodore S.

Hitler was jeered by an angry crowd at [[Hof, Germany|Hof]], near [[Nuremberg]] \u2013 the only time he was opposed to his face in public during his 12 years of rule.<ref>Gitta Sereny, ''Into That Darkness'' (New York: McGraw-Hill 1974; reprint, Vintage Books, 1983) at 59.</ref> Hitler knew that he could not afford a confrontation with the Church at a time when Germany was engaged in a life-and-death two-front war. (It needs to be remembered that following the annexations of [[Austria]] and the [[Sudetenland]], nearly half of all Germans were Catholic.) On 24 August he ordered the cancellation of the T4 programme and issued strict instructions to the Gauleiters that there were to be no further provocations of the churches during the war.\n\n[[Pius XII]] became Pope on the eve of [[World War II]], and [[Pius XII and the German Resistance|maintained links to the German Resistance]]. Although remaining publicly neutral, Pius advised the British in 1940 of the readiness of certain German generals to overthrow Hitler if they could be assured of an honourable peace, offered assistance to the German resistance in the event of a coup and warned the Allies of the planned German invasion of the Low Countries in 1940.<ref>John Toland; Hitler; Wordsworth Editions; 1997 Edn; p. 760</ref><ref>William L.

He stated his \"profound grief\" at the murder of the deformed, the insane, and those suffering from hereditary disease... as though they were a useless burden to Society\", in condemnation of the ongoing [[euthanasia in Nazi Germany|Nazi euthanasia program]]. The Encyclical was followed, on 26 September 1943, by an open condemnation by the German Bishops which, from every German pulpit, denounced the killing of \"innocent and defenceless mentally handicapped, incurably infirm and fatally wounded, innocent hostages, and disarmed prisoners of war and criminal offenders, people of a foreign race or descent\".<ref>Richard J.

In May 1938, the army leadership was made aware of Hitler's intention of invading [[Czechoslovakia]], even at the risk of war with [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[France]], and/or the [[Soviet Union]]. The Army Chief of Staff, General [[Ludwig Beck]], regarded this as not only immoral but reckless, since he believed that Germany would lose such a war. Oster and Beck sent emissaries to Paris and London to advise the British and French to resist Hitler's demands, and thereby strengthen the hand of Hitler's opponents in the Army. Weizs\u00e4cker also sent private messages to London urging resistance. The British and French were extremely doubtful of the ability of the German opposition to overthrow the Nazi regime and ignored these messages. An official of the British Foreign Office wrote on August 28, 1938: \"We have had similar visits from other emissaries of the ''Reichsheer'', such as Dr. Goerdeler, but those for whom these emissaries claim to speak have never given us any reasons to suppose that they would be able or willing to take action such as would lead to the overthrow of the regime.

When Hitler was informed of this, he demanded and received Beck's resignation. Beck was highly respected in the army and his removal shocked the officer corps. His successor as chief of staff, [[Franz Halder]], remained in touch with him, and was also in touch with Oster. Privately, he said that he considered Hitler \"the incarnation of evil\".<ref>Joachim Fest, ''Plotting Hitler\u2019s Death: The German Resistance to Hitler 1933\u20131945'', 86</ref> During September, plans for a move against Hitler were formulated, involving General [[Erwin von Witzleben]], who was the army commander of the Berlin Military Region and thus well-placed to stage a coup.\n\nOster, Gisevius, and Schacht urged Halder and Beck to stage an immediate coup against Hitler, but the army officers argued that they could only mobilize support among the officer corps for such a step if Hitler made overt moves towards war. Halder nevertheless asked Oster to draw up plans for a coup. Weizs\u00e4cker and Canaris were made aware of these plans. The conspirators disagreed on what to do about Hitler if there was a successful army coup \u2013 eventually most overcame their scruples and agreed that he must be killed so that army officers would be free from their oath of loyalty. They agreed Halder would instigate the coup when Hitler committed an overt step towards war. During the planning for the 1938 ''putsch'', [[Carl Friedrich Goerdeler]] was in contact through the intermediary of General [[Alexander von Falkenhausen]] with Chinese intelligence<ref name=\"Liang, His-Huey page 359\">Liang, His-Huey \"China, the Sino-Japanese Conflict and the Munich Crisis\" pages 342\u2013369 from ''The Munich Crisis'' edited by Erik Goldstein and Igor Lukes, London: Frank Cass, 1999 page 359</ref> Most German conservatives favoured Germany's traditional informal alliance with China, and were strongly opposed to the about-face in Germany's Far Eastern policies effected in early 1938 by [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]], who abandoned the alliance with China for an alignment with Japan.<ref name=\"Liang, His-Huey page 359\"/> As a consequence, agents of Chinese intelligence supported the proposed ''putsch'' as a way of restoring the Sino-German alliance.<ref name=\"Liang, His-Huey page 359\"/>\n\nRemarkably, the army commander, General [[Walther von Brauchitsch]], was well aware of the coup preparations. He told Halder he could not condone such an act, but he did not inform Hitler, to whom he was outwardly subservient, of what he knew.<ref>Joachim Fest, ''Plotting Hitler\u2019s Death: The German Resistance to Hitler 1933\u20131945'', 95</ref> This was a striking example of the code of silent solidarity among senior German Army officers, which was to survive and provide a shield for the resistance groups down to, and in many cases beyond, the crisis of July 1944.\n\n===Munich crisis===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R69173, M\u00fcnchener Abkommen, Staatschefs.jpg|thumb|left|From left to right, [[Neville Chamberlain]], [[\u00c9douard Daladier]], [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Benito Mussolini]] and Italian Foreign Minister [[Count Ciano]] as they prepare to sign the [[Munich Agreement]]]]\n\nOn 13 September, the British Prime Minister, [[Neville Chamberlain]], announced that he would visit Germany to meet Hitler and defuse the crisis over Czechoslovakia. This threw the conspirators into uncertainty. When, on 20 September, it appeared that the negotiations had broken down and that Chamberlain would resist Hitler's demands, the coup preparations were revived and finalised. All that was required was the signal from Halder.\n\nOn 28 September, however Chamberlain agreed to a [[Munich Agreement|meeting in Munich]], at which he accepted the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia. This plunged the resistance into demoralisation and division. Halder said he would no longer support a coup. The other conspirators were bitterly critical of Chamberlain, but were powerless to act. This was the nearest approach to a successful conspiracy against Hitler before the plot of 20 July 1944. In December 1938, Goerdeler visited Britain to seek support.{{sfn|Hammerow|1997|p=258}} Goerdeler's demands for the Polish Corridor to be returned to Germany together with former colonies in Africa together with a loan to a post-Hitler government made a very poor impression with the British Foreign Office, not the least because he seemed to differ with the Nazis only in degree rather in kind.{{sfn|Hammerow|1997|p=257-259}} In June 1939, Adam von Trott visited Britain where he presented his \"Danzig for Prague\" plan, offering to restore Czech independence (through Germany would keep the Sudetenland) in exchange for which Britain would pressure Poland to return the Polish Corridor and the Free City of Danzig to Germany.{{sfn|Hammerow|1997|p=259-260}}  \n\nAs war again grew more likely in mid-1939, the plans for a pre-emptive coup were revived. Oster was still in contact with Halder and Witzleben, although Witzleben had been transferred to [[Frankfurt am Main]], reducing his ability to lead a coup attempt. At a meeting with Goerdeler, Witzleben agreed to form a network of army commanders willing to take part to prevent a war against the western powers. But support in the officer corps for a coup had dropped sharply since 1938. Most officers, particularly those from [[Prussian aristocracy|Prussian landowning backgrounds]], were strongly anti-Polish. Just before the invasion of [[Poland]] in August 1939, General [[Eduard Wagner]] who was one of the officers involved in the abortive ''putsch'' of September 1938, wrote in a letter to his wife: \u201cWe believe we will make quick work of the Poles, and in truth, we are delighted at the prospect. That business ''must'' be cleared up\" (Emphasis in the original)<ref name=\"Hillgruber, Andreas page 77\">Hillgruber, Andreas ''Germany and the Two World Wars'' Harvard University Press: Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America, 1981 page 77</ref> The German historian [[Andreas Hillgruber]] commented that in 1939 the rampant [[Anti-Polish sentiment|anti-Polish]] feelings in the German Army officer corps served to bind the military together with Hitler in supporting [[Fall Weiss (1939)|Fall Weiss]] in a way that [[Fall Gr\u00fcn (Czechoslovakia)|Fall Gr\u00fcn]] did not.<ref name=\"Hillgruber, Andreas page 77\"/> The officers who had willing to consider taking part in a ''putsch'' in 1938 loyally rallied to the Nazi regime in 1939 when faced with the prospect of war with Poland.{{sfn|Hammerow|1997|p=261-262}} Likewise, the Catholic Bishop Galen delivered a sermon calling the war against Poland a struggle to \"win a peace of freedom and justice for our nation\".{{sfn|Hammerow|1997|p=262}}  \n\nThis nevertheless marked an important turning point. In 1938, the plan had been for the army, led by Halder and if possible Brauchitsch, to depose Hitler. This was now impossible, and a conspiratorial organisation was to be formed in the army and civil service instead.\n\nThe opposition again urged Britain and France to stand up to Hitler: Halder met secretly with the British Ambassador Sir [[Nevile Henderson]] to urge resistance. The plan was again to stage a coup at the moment Hitler moved to declare war. However, although Britain and France were now prepared to go to war over Poland, as war approached, Halder lost his nerve. Schacht, Gisevius and Canaris developed a plan to confront Brauchitsch and Halder and demand that they depose Hitler and prevent war, but nothing came of this. When Hitler invaded Poland on 1 September, the conspirators were unable to act.\n\n===Outbreak of war===\nThe outbreak of war made the further mobilization of resistance in the army more difficult. Halder continued to vacillate. In late 1939 and early 1940 he opposed Hitler's plans to attack France, and kept in touch with the opposition through General [[Carl-Heinrich von St\u00fclpnagel]], an active oppositionist. Talk of a coup again began to circulate, and for the first time the idea of killing Hitler with a bomb was taken up by the more determined members of the resistance circles, such as Oster and Erich Kordt, who declared himself willing to do the deed. At the army headquarters at [[Zossen]], south of Berlin, a group of officers called Action Group Zossen was also planning a coup.\n\nWhen in November 1939 it seemed that Hitler was about to order an immediate attack in the west, the conspirators persuaded General [[Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb]], commander of Army Group C on the Belgian border, to support a planned coup if Hitler gave such an order. At the same time Oster warned the Dutch and the Belgians that Hitler was about to attack them \u2013 his warnings were not believed. But when Hitler postponed the attack until 1940, the conspiracy again lost momentum, and Halder formed the view that the German people would not accept a coup. Again, the chance was lost.\n\nWith Poland overrun but France and the Low Countries yet to be attacked, the German Resistance sought the Pope's assistance in preparations for a coup to oust Hitler.<ref name=\"John Toland p.760\">John Toland; ''Hitler''; Wordsworth Editions; 1997 Edn; p.760</ref> In the winter of 1939/40, the Bavarian lawyer and reserve 'Abwehr' officer [[Josef M\u00fcller (CSU politician)|Josef M\u00fcller]], acting as an emissary for the military opposition centered around General Franz Halder, contacted Monsignore [[Ludwig Kaas]], the exiled leader of the German Catholic [[Centre Party (Germany)|Zentrum]] party, in Rome, hoping to use the Pope as an intermediary to contact the British.<ref>Chadwick, 1988, pp. 86-87</ref> Kaas put M\u00fcller in contact with Father [[Robert Leiber]], who personally asked the Pope to relay the information about the German resistance to the British.<ref name=\"c87\">Chadwick, 1988, p. 87</ref>\n\nThe Vatican considered M\u00fcller to be a representative of Colonel-General von Beck and agreed to offer the machinery for mediation.<ref name=\"Peter Hoffmann p.160\">Peter Hoffmann; The History of the German Resistance 1933-1945; 3rd Edn (First English Edn); McDonald & Jane's; London; 1977; p.160</ref><ref name=\"William L. Shirer p648-9\">William L. Shirer; The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich; Secker & Warburg; London; 1960; p648-9</ref>  Oster, [[Wilhelm Canaris]] and [[Hans von Dohn\u00e1nyi]], backed by Beck, told M\u00fcller to ask Pius to ascertain whether the British would enter negotiations with the German opposition which wanted to overthrow Hitler. The British agreed to negotiate, provided the Vatican could vouch for the opposition's representative. Pius, communicating with Britain's [[Francis d'Arcy Osborne]], channelled communications back and forth in secrecy.<ref name=\"Peter Hoffmann p.160\"/> The Vatican agreed to send a letter outlining the bases for peace with England and the participation of the Pope was used to try to persuade senior German Generals Halder and Brauchitsch to act against Hitler.<ref name=\"John Toland p.760\"/> Negotiations were tense, with a Western offensive expected, and on the basis that substantive negotiations could only follow the replacement of the Hitler regime.<ref name=\"Peter Hoffmann p.160\"/> Pius, without offering endorsement, advised Osbourne on 11 January 1940 that the German opposition had said that a German offensive was planned for February, but that this could be averted if the German generals could be assured of peace with Britain, and not on punitive terms. If this could be assured, then they were willing to move to replace Hitler. The British government had doubts as to the capacity of the conspirators. On 7 February, the Pope updated Osbourne that the opposition wanted to replace the Nazi regime with a democratic federation, but hoped to retain Austria and the Sudetenland. The British government was non-committal, and said that while the federal model was of interest, the promises and sources of the opposition were too vague. Nevertheless, the resistance were encouraged by the talks, and Muller told his contact that a coup would occur in February. Pius appeared to continue to hope for a coup in Germany into March 1940.<ref>Peter Hoffmann; The History of the German Resistance 1933-1945; 3rd Edn (First English Edn); McDonald & Jane's; London; 1977; p.160-163</ref>\n\nFollowing the Fall of France, peace overtures continued to emanate from the Vatican as well as Sweden and the United States, to which Churchill responded resolutely that Germany would first have to free its conquered territories.<ref>William L. Shirer; The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich; Secker & Warburg; London; 1960; p. 750</ref> The negotiations ultimately proved fruitless. Hitler's swift victories over France and the Low Countries deflated the will of the German military to resist Hitler. Muller was arrested during the Nazis first raid on Military Intelligence in 1943. He spent the rest of the war in concentration camps, ending up at Dachau.<ref>[[Joachim Fest]]; ''Plotting Hitler's Death: The German Resistance to Hitler 1933\u201345''; Weidenfeld & Nicolson 1996 p.131</ref>\n\nThe failed plots of 1938 and 1939 showed both the strength and weakness of the officer corps as potential leaders of a resistance movement. Its strength was its loyalty and solidarity. As [[Istvan Deak]] noted: \"Officers, especially of the highest ranks, had been discussing, some as early as 1934&nbsp;... the possibility of deposing or even assassinating Hitler. Yet it seems that not a single one was betrayed by a comrade-in-arms to the Gestapo.\"<ref>New York Review of Books, 13 January 1994</ref> Remarkably, in over two years of plotting, this widespread and loosely structured conspiracy was never detected. One explanation is that at this time Himmler was still preoccupied with the traditional enemies of the Nazis, the SPD and the KPD (and, of course, the Jews), and did not suspect that the real centre of opposition was within the state itself. Another factor was Canaris\u2019 success in shielding the plotters, particularly Oster, from suspicion.\n\nThe corresponding weakness of the officer corps was its conception of loyalty to the state and its aversion to mutiny. This explains the vacillations of Halder, who could never quite bring himself to take the decisive step. Halder hated Hitler, and believed that the Nazis were leading Germany to catastrophe. He was shocked and disgusted by the behaviour of the SS in occupied Poland, but gave no support to his senior officer there, General [[Johannes Blaskowitz]], when the latter officially protested to Hitler about the atrocities against the Poles and the Jews. In 1938 and again in 1939, he lost his nerve and could not give the order to strike against Hitler. This was even more true of Brauchitsch, who knew of the conspiracies and assured Halder that he agreed with their objectives, but would not take any action to support them.\n\nThe outbreak of war served to rally the German people around the Hitler regime, and the sweeping early successes of the German Army \u2013 occupying Poland in 1939, Denmark and Norway in April 1940, and swiftly defeating France in May and June 1940, stilled virtually all opposition to the regime. The opposition to Hitler within the Army was left isolated and apparently discredited, since the much-feared war with the western powers had apparently been won by Germany within a year and at little cost. This mood continued well into 1941, although beneath the surface popular discontent at mounting economic hardship was apparent.\n\n==First assassination attempt==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-E12329, M\u00fcnchen, B\u00fcrgerbr\u00e4ukeller, Sprengstoffanschlag.jpg|thumb|Ruins of the [[B\u00fcrgerbr\u00e4ukeller]] in [[Munich]] after [[Georg Elser]]'s failed assassination of Hitler in November 1939]]\n\nIn November 1939, [[Georg Elser]], a carpenter from [[W\u00fcrttemberg]], developed a plan to assassinate Hitler completely on his own. Elser had been peripherally involved with the KPD before 1933, but his exact motives for acting as he did remain a mystery. He read in the newspapers that Hitler would be addressing a Nazi Party meeting on 8 November, in the [[B\u00fcrgerbr\u00e4ukeller]], a beer hall in [[Munich]] where Hitler had launched the [[Beer Hall Putsch]] on the same date in 1923. Stealing explosives from his workplace, he built a powerful time bomb, and for over a month managed to stay inside the B\u00fcrgerbr\u00e4ukeller after hours each night, during which time he hollowed out the pillar behind the speaker's rostrum to place the bomb inside.\n\nOn the night of 7 November 1939, Elser set the timer and left for the Swiss border. Unexpectedly, because of the pressure of wartime business, Hitler made a much shorter speech than usual and left the hall 13 minutes before the bomb went off, killing seven people. Sixty-three people were injured, sixteen more were seriously injured with one dying later. Had Hitler still been speaking, the bomb almost certainly would have killed him.\n\nThis event set off a hunt for potential conspirators which intimidated the opposition and made further action more difficult. Elser was arrested at the border, sent to the Sachsenhausen Concentration Camp, and then in 1945 moved to the [[Dachau concentration camp]]; he was executed two weeks before the liberation of Dachau KZ.\n\n==Nadir of resistance: 1940\u201342==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2008}}\nIn February 1940, [[Ulrich von Hassell]] met with [[James Lonsdale-Bryans]] to discuss plans to \"stop this mad war\".{{sfn|Hammerow|1997|p=277}} The peace terms that Hassell unveiled stated that Germany would keep the Sudetenland and Austria while \"the German-Polish frontier will have be more or less identical with the German frontier of 1914\".{{sfn|Hammerow|1997|p=277}} Though Britain in 1940 was prepared to cede the first two demands, but the demand that Poland was to surrender land to Germany as part of a peace terms proved to be a problem.{{sfn|Hammerow|1997|p=277-278}}\n\nThe national-conservatives were strongly opposed to the Treaty of Versailles and tended to support the aims of Nazi foreign policy, at least when it came to challenging Versailles.{{sfn|Hammerow|1997|p=276}} In their plans for a post-Nazi Germany, the conservatives took it for granted that Germany would keep the Sudetenland, Austria, the Memelland, and all of the parts of Poland that had once been German.{{sfn|Hammerow|1997|p=276}} Most were willing to consider restoring nominal independence to the Poles and Czechs, but even then, both the reduced Polish and Czech states would have to be \"client states\" of the ''Reich''.{{sfn|Hammerow|1997|p=276}} Objections to Nazi foreign policy tended to be over the means, not the ends, with most conservatives taking the viewpoint that Hitler had conducted his foreign policy in a gratuitously aggressive manner that had caused war with Britain and France, made all the more objectionable because the policy of appeasement showed a willingness to accept Germany's return to great power status without a war.{{sfn|Hammerow|1997|p=276-277}}              \n\nThe sweeping success of Hitler's attack on France in May 1940 made the task of deposing him even more difficult. Most army officers, their fears of a war against the western powers apparently proven groundless, and gratified by Germany's revenge against France for the defeat of 1918, reconciled themselves to Hitler's regime, choosing to ignore its darker side. The task of leading the resistance groups for a time fell to civilians, although a hard core of military plotters remained active.\n\n[[Carl Goerdeler]], the former lord mayor of [[Leipzig]], emerged as a key figure. His associates included the diplomat [[Ulrich von Hassell]], the Prussian Finance Minister [[Johannes Popitz]], and [[Helmuth James Graf von Moltke]], heir to a famous name and the leading figure in the [[Kreisau Circle]] of Prussian oppositionists. These opposionists included other young aristocrats such as [[Adam von Trott zu Solz]] and [[Peter Yorck von Wartenburg]], and later [[Gottfried Graf von Bismarck-Sch\u00f6nhausen]], who was a Nazi member of the Reichstag and a senior officer in the SS. Goerdeler was also in touch with the SPD underground, whose most prominent figure was [[Julius Leber]], and with Christian opposition groups, both Catholic and Protestant.\n\nThese men saw themselves as the leaders of a post-Hitler government, but they had no clear conception of how to bring this about, except through assassinating Hitler \u2013 a step which many of them still opposed on ethical grounds. Their plans could never surmount the fundamental problem of Hitler's overwhelming popularity among the German people. They preoccupied themselves with philosophical debates and devising grand schemes for postwar Germany. The fact was that for nearly two years after the defeat of France, there was little scope for opposition activity.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1976-130-53, Henning v. Tresckow.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Henning von Tresckow]]]]\n\nIn March 1941, Hitler revealed his plans for a \"war of annihilation\" against the Soviet Union to selected army officers in a speech given in [[Pozna\u0144|Posen]]. In the audience was Colonel [[Henning von Tresckow]], who had not been involved in any of the earlier plots but was already a firm opponent of the Nazi regime. He was horrified by Hitler's plan to unleash a new and even more terrible war in the east. As a nephew of Field Marshal [[Fedor von Bock]], he was very well connected. Tresckow appealed unsuccessfully to Bock to not enforce the orders for the \"war of annihilation\".{{sfn|Hammerow|1997|p=292}}   Assigned to the staff of his uncle's command, Army Group Centre, for the forthcoming [[Operation Barbarossa]], Tresckow systematically recruited oppositionists to the group's staff, making it the new nerve centre of the army resistance.\n\nAmerican journalist [[Howard K. Smith]] wrote in 1942 that of the three groups in opposition to Hitler, the military was more important than the churches and the Communists.<ref name=\"smith1942\">{{cite book | title=Last Train from Berlin | publisher=Knopf | author=Smith, Howard K. | authorlink=Howard K. Smith | year=1942 | pages=281}}</ref> Little could be done while Hitler's armies advanced triumphantly into the western regions of the Soviet Union through 1941 and 1942 \u2013 even after the setback before [[Moscow]] in December 1941 that led to the dismissal of both Brauchitsch and Bock. In December 1941, the [[United States]] entered the war, persuading some more realistic army officers that Germany must ultimately lose the war. But the life-and-death struggle on the eastern front posed new problems for the resistance. Most of its members were conservatives who hated and feared [[communism]] and the Soviet Union. The question of how the Nazi regime could be overthrown and the war ended without allowing the Soviets to gain control of Germany or the whole of Europe was made more acute when the Allies adopted their policy of demanding Germany's \"unconditional surrender\" at the [[Casablanca Conference (1943)|Casablanca Conference]] of January 1943.\n\nDuring 1942, the tireless Oster nevertheless succeeded in rebuilding an effective resistance network. His most important recruit was General [[Friedrich Olbricht]], head of the General Army Office headquartered at the [[Bendlerblock]] in central Berlin, who controlled an independent system of communications to reserve units all over Germany. Linking this asset to Tresckow's resistance group in Army Group Centre created what appeared to a viable structure for a new effort at organising a coup. Bock's dismissal did not weaken Tresckow's position. In fact he soon enticed Bock's successor, General [[G\u00fcnther von Kluge|Hans von Kluge]], at least part-way to supporting the resistance cause. Tresckow even brought Goerdeler, leader of the civilian resistance, to Army Group Centre to meet Kluge \u2013 an extremely dangerous tactic. \n\nConservatives like Goerdeler were opposed to the Treaty of Versailles and favored restoring the ''Reich'' back to the frontiers of 1914 together with keeping Austria.{{sfn|Mommsen|2003|p=183-184}} These territorial demands for keeping Alsace-Lorraine together with the parts of Poland that had once belonged to Germany made for many difficulties in Goerdeler's attempts to reach an accord with governments of Britain and the United States.{{sfn|Mommsen|2003|p=184}} Stauffenberg felt that these were unrealistic demands and Goerdeler would have done better if he was prepared to accept a return to the frontiers created by the Treaty of Versailles. Most of the conservatives favored the creation of an unified Europe led by Germany after the planned overthrow of Hitler.{{sfn|Mommsen|2003|p=184-185}} Goerdeler in particular devoted much thought in his memos for a federation of European states and an pan-European economy while Hassell wrote in his diary of his hopes for an \"Occident under German leadership\".{{sfn|Mommsen|2003|p=185}} Moltke envisioned \"a great economic community would emerge from the demobilization of armed forces in Europe\" that would be \"managed by an internal European economic bureaucracy\".{{sfn|Mommsen|2003|p=188}} Trott advocated the tariff and currency union of all the European states, a common European citizenship and a Supreme Court for Europe.{{sfn|Mommsen|2003|p=189}} As late as May 1944, Goerdeler prepared peace terms that once again called for keeping Austria, the Sudetenland, the Memelland, various parts of Poland, Alsace-Lorraine, and a new demand for keeping South Tirol as well.{{sfn|Hammerow|1997|p=347}} Even General Beck warned Goerdeler that these demands were completely detached from reality, and would be rejected by the Allies.{{sfn|Hammerow|1997|p=347-348}}\n\n==Communist resistance==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2008}}\n[[File:Memorial to Harro Schulze-Boysen.JPG|thumb|Memorial to Harro Schulze-Boysen, [[Niederkirchnerstrasse]], Berlin]]\n\nThe entry of the Soviet Union into the war had certain consequences for the civilian resistance. During the period of the [[Nazi\u2013Soviet Pact]], the [[Communist Party of Germany|KPD]]'s only objective inside Germany was to keep itself in existence: it engaged in no active resistance to the Nazi regime. After June 1941, however, all Communists were expected to throw themselves into resistance work, including sabotage and espionage where this was possible, regardless of risk. A handful of Soviet agents, mostly exiled German Communists, were able to enter Germany to help the scattered underground KPD cells organise and take action. This led to the formation in 1942 of two separate communist groups, usually erroneously lumped together under the name [[Red Orchestra (spy)|Rote Kapelle]] (\"Red Orchestra\"), a codename given to these groups by the Gestapo.\n\nThe first \"Red Orchestra\" was an espionage network based in Berlin and coordinated by [[Leopold Trepper]], a [[GRU]] agent sent into Germany in October 1941. This group made reports to the Soviet Union on German troop concentrations, air attacks on Germany, German aircraft production, and German fuel shipments. In France, it worked with the underground [[French Communist Party]]. Agents of this group even managed to tap the phone lines of the Abwehr in Paris. Trepper was eventually arrested and the group broken up by the spring of 1943.\n\nThe second and more important \"Red Orchestra\" group was entirely separate and was a genuine German resistance group, not controlled by the [[NKVD]] (the Soviet intelligence agency and predecessor to the [[KGB]]). This group was led by [[Harro Schulze-Boysen]], an intelligence officer at the [[Reich Air Ministry]], and [[Arvid Harnack]], an official in the Ministry of Economics, both self-identified communists but not apparently KPD members. The group however contained people of various beliefs and affiliations. It included the theatre producer [[Adam Kuckhoff]], the author [[G\u00fcnther Weisenborn]], the journalist [[John Graudenz]] and the pianist [[Helmut Roloff]]. It thus conformed to the general pattern of German resistance groups of being drawn mainly from elite groups.\n\nThe main activity of the group was collecting information about Nazi atrocities and distributing leaflets against Hitler rather than espionage. They passed what they had learned to foreign countries, through personal contacts with the U.S. embassy and, via a less direct connection, to the Soviet government. When Soviet agents tried to enlist this group in their service, Schulze-Boysen and Harnack refused, since they wanted to maintain their political independence. The group was revealed to the Gestapo in August 1942 by [[Johann Wenzel]], a member of the Trepper group who also knew of the Schulze-Boysen group and who informed on them after being discovered and tortured for several weeks . Schulze-Boysen, Harnack and other members of the group were arrested and secretly executed.\n\nMeanwhile, another Communist resistance group was operating in Berlin, led by a Jewish electrician, [[Herbert Baum]], and involving up to a hundred people. Until 1941, the group operated a study circle, but after the German attack on the Soviet Union a core group advanced to active resistance. In May 1942, the group staged an arson attack on an anti-Soviet propaganda display at the [[Lustgarten]] in central Berlin. The attack was poorly organised and most of the Baum group was arrested. Twenty were sentenced to death, while Baum himself \"died in custody\". This fiasco ended overt Communist resistance activities, although the KPD underground continued to operate, and re-emerged from hiding in the last days of the war.\n\n==After Stalingrad==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-E0406-0022-011, Russland, deutscher Kriegsgefangener.jpg|thumb|Red Army soldier marches a German soldier into captivity after the victory at the [[Battle of Stalingrad]]]]\nAt the end of 1942, Germany suffered a series of military defeats, the first at [[Second Battle of El Alamein|El Alamein]], the second with the successful Allied landings in North Africa ([[Operation Torch]]), and the third the disastrous defeat at [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]], which ended any hope of defeating the Soviet Union. Most experienced senior officers now came to the conclusion that Hitler was leading Germany to defeat, and that the result of this would be the Soviet conquest of Germany \u2013 the worst fate imaginable. This gave the military resistance new impetus.\n\nHalder had been dismissed in 1942 and there was now no independent central leadership of the Army. His nominal successors, Field Marshal [[Wilhelm Keitel]] and General [[Alfred Jodl]], were no more than Hitler's messengers. Tresckow and Goerdeler tried again to recruit the senior Army field commanders to support a seizure of power. Kluge was by now won over completely. Gersdorff was sent to see Field Marshal [[Erich von Manstein]], the commander of Army Group South in the [[Ukraine]]. Manstein agreed that Hitler was leading Germany to defeat, but told Gersdorff that \u201cPrussian field marshals do not mutiny.\u201d<ref>Joachim Fest, ''Plotting Hitler\u2019s Death: The German Resistance to Hitler 1933&ndash;1945'', 200</ref> Field Marshal [[Gerd von Rundstedt]], commander in the west, gave a similar answer. The prospect of a united German Army seizing power from Hitler was as far away as ever. Once again, however, neither officer reported that they had been approached in this way.\n\nNevertheless, the days when the military and civilian plotters could expect to escape detection were ending. After Stalingrad, Himmler would have had to be na\u00efve not to expect that conspiracies against the regime would be hatched in the Army and elsewhere. He already suspected Canaris and his subordinates at the Abwehr. In March 1943, two of them, Oster and [[Hans von Dohn\u00e1nyi]], were dismissed on suspicion of opposition activity, although there was yet insufficient evidence to have them arrested. On the civilian front, [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]] was also arrested at this time, and Goerdeler was under suspicion.\n\nThe Gestapo had been led to Dohnanyi following the arrest of {{Interlanguage link multi|Wilhelm Schmidhuber|de}}, who had helped Dohnanyi with information and with smuggling Jews out of Germany. Under interrogation, Schmidhuber gave the Gestapo details of the Oster-Dohnanyi group in the Abwehr and about Goerdeler and Beck's involvement in opposition activities. The Gestapo reported all this to Himmler, with the observation that Canaris must be protecting Oster and Dohnanyi and the recommendation that he be arrested. Himmler passed the file back with the note \"Kindly leave Canaris alone.\"<ref>Peter Padfield, ''Himmler'', 422</ref> Either Himmler felt Canaris was too powerful to tackle at this stage, or he wanted him and his oppositional network protected for reasons of his own. Nevertheless, Oster's usefulness to the resistance was now greatly reduced. However, the Gestapo did not have information about the full workings of the resistance. Most importantly, they did not know about the resistance networks based on Army Group Centre or the Bendlerblock.\n\nMeanwhile, the disaster at Stalingrad, which cost Germany 400,000 casualties, was sending waves of horror and grief through German society, but causing remarkably little reduction in the people's faith in Hitler and in Germany's ultimate victory. This was a source of great frustration to the military and civil service plotters, who virtually all came from the elite and had privileged access to information, giving them a much greater appreciation of the hopelessness of Germany's situation than was possessed by the German people.\n===Aeroplane assassination attempt===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Friedrich Olbricht.gif|thumb|General [[Friedrich Olbricht]]]] -->\n\nIn late 1942, von Tresckow and Olbricht formulated a plan to assassinate Hitler and stage a coup. On 13 March 1943, returning from his easternmost headquarters FHQ [[Werwolf (Wehrmacht headquarters)|Wehrwolf]] near [[Vinnytsia|Vinnitsa]] to [[Wolfsschanze]] in East Prussia, Hitler was scheduled to make a stop-over at the headquarters of [[Army Group Centre]] at [[Smolensk]]. For such an occasion, von Tresckow had prepared three options:<ref>[http://www.geschichtsthemen.de/attentate_chronik.htm Chronik aller Attentate auf Hitler<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n# Major [[Georg von Boeselager]], in command of a cavalry honor guard, could intercept Hitler in a forest and overwhelm the SS bodyguard and the F\u00fchrer in a fair fight; this course was rejected because of the prospect of a large number of German soldiers fighting each other, and a possible failure regarding the unexpected strength of the escort.\n# A joint assassination could be carried out during dinner; this idea was abandoned as supporting officers abhorred the idea of shooting the unarmed tyrant.\n# A bomb could be smuggled on Hitler's plane.\n\nVon Tresckow asked Lieutenant Colonel [[Heinz Brandt]], on Hitler's staff and usually on the same plane that carried Hitler, to take a parcel with him, supposedly the prize of a bet won by Tresckow's friend [[Helmuth Stieff|General Stieff]]. It concealed a bomb, disguised in a box for two bottles of [[Cointreau]]. Von Tresckow's aide, Lieutenant [[Fabian von Schlabrendorff]], set the fuse and handed over the parcel to Brandt who boarded the same plane as Hitler.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.lexikon-der-wehrmacht.de/Chronik/1943.htm |title=1943<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2007-07-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070804201359/http://www.lexikon-der-wehrmacht.de/Chronik/1943.htm |archive-date=2007-08-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nHitler's [[Focke-Wulf Fw 200]] ''Condor'' was expected to explode about 30 minutes later near [[Minsk]], close enough to the front to be attributed to Soviet fighters. Olbricht was to use the resulting crisis to mobilise his Reserve Army network to seize power in Berlin, Vienna, Munich and in the German [[Wehrkreis]] centres. It was an ambitious but credible plan, and might have worked if Hitler had indeed been killed, although persuading Army units to fight and overcome what could certainly have been fierce resistance from the SS could have been a major obstacle.\n\nHowever, as with Elser's bomb in 1939 and all other attempts, luck favoured Hitler again, which was attributed to \"Vorsehung\" ([[divine providence|providence]]). The British-made chemical [[pencil detonator]] on the bomb had been tested many times and was considered reliable. It went off, but the bomb did not. The [[percussion cap]] apparently became too cold as the parcel was carried in the unheated cargo hold.\n\nDisplaying great ''[[Wiktionary:sangfroid|sangfroid]]'', Schlabrendorff took the next plane to retrieve the package from Colonel Brandt before the content was discovered. The blocks of plastic explosives were later used by Gersdorff and Stauffenberg.\n\n===Suicide bombing attempts===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1976-130-51, Rudolf-Christoph v. Gersdorff.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Rudolf Christoph Freiherr von Gersdorff]]]]\nA second attempt was made a few days later on 21 March 1943, when Hitler visited an exhibition of captured Soviet weaponry in Berlin's [[Zeughaus]]. One of Tresckow's friends, Colonel [[Rudolf Christoph Freiherr von Gersdorff]], was scheduled to explain some exhibits, and volunteered to carry out a [[suicide bombing]] using the same bomb that had failed to go off on the plane, concealed on his person. However, the only new chemical fuse he could obtain was a ten-minute one. Hitler again left prematurely after hurrying through the exhibition much quicker than the scheduled 30 minutes. Gersdorff had to dash to a bathroom to defuse the bomb to save his life, and more importantly, prevent any suspicion.<ref>Philip von Boeselager, Valkyrie: The plot to kill hitler, London, Phoenix 2009, 99-105</ref> This second failure temporarily demoralised the plotters at Army Group Centre. Gersdorff reported about the attempt after the war; the footage is often seen on German TV documentaries (\"Die Nacht des Widerstands\" etc.), including a photo showing Gersdorff and Hitler.\n\n[[Axel von dem Bussche]], member of the elite [[Infantry Regiment 9]], volunteered to kill Hitler with hand grenades in November 1943 during a presentation of new winter uniforms, but the train containing them was destroyed by Allied bombs in Berlin, and the event had to be postponed. A second presentation scheduled for December at the [[Wolfsschanze]] was canceled on short notice as Hitler decided to travel to Berchtesgaden.\n\nIn January 1944, Bussche volunteered for another assassination attempt, but then he lost a leg in Russia. On February 11, another young officer, [[Ewald-Heinrich von Kleist]] tried to assassinate Hitler in the same way von dem Bussche had planned. However Hitler again canceled the event which would have allowed Kleist to approach him.\n\nOn 11 March 1944, [[Eberhard von Breitenbuch]] volunteered for an assassination attempt at the [[Berghof (Hitler)|Berghof]] using a 7.65&nbsp;mm Browning pistol concealed in his trouser pocket. He was not able to carry out the plan because guards would not allow him into the conference room with the [[F\u00fchrer]].\n\nThe next occasion was a weapons exhibition on July 7 at [[Schloss Klessheim]] near Salzburg, but [[Helmuth Stieff]] did not trigger the bomb.\n\n===The White Rose===\nThe only visible manifestation of opposition to the regime following Stalingrad was the spontaneous action of a few university students who denounced the war and the persecution and mass murder of Jews in the east. They were organised in the [[White Rose]] group, which was centered in Munich but had connections in Berlin, Hamburg, Stuttgart and Vienna.\n\nIn the spring of 1942, they launched an anti-Nazi campaign of handbills in and around the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Ludwig Maximilians University]] in Munich. This campaign continued after a brief hiatus in January 1943, when some members of the group also graffitied local buildings. They were detected and some arrested. \nThree members, [[Hans Scholl]], [[Sophie Scholl]], and [[Christoph Probst]] were to stand trial before the Nazi [[People's Court (Germany)|\"People's Court\"]], where on 22 February 1943, the President of the court, [[Roland Freisler]], sentenced them to death. They were guillotined that same day at [[Stadelheim Prison]].\n[[Kurt Huber]], a professor of philosophy and musicology, [[Alexander Schmorell]], and [[Willi Graf]] stood trial later and were sentenced to death as well, while many others were sentenced to prison terms. The last member to be executed was [[Hans Conrad Leipelt]] on 29 January 1945.\n\nThis outbreak was surprising and worrying to the Nazi regime, because the universities had been strongholds of Nazi sentiment even before Hitler had come to power. Similarly, it gave heart to the scattered and demoralised resistance groups. But the White Rose was not a sign of widespread civilian disaffection from the regime, and had no imitators elsewhere, although their sixth leaflet, re-titled \"The Manifesto of the Students of Munich\", was dropped by Allied planes in July 1943, and became widely known in World War II Germany. The underground SPD and KPD were able to maintain their networks, and reported increasing discontent at the course of the war and at the resultant economic hardship, particularly among the industrial workers and among farmers (who suffered from the acute shortage of labour with so many young men away at the front). However, there was nothing approaching active hostility to the regime. Most Germans continued to revere Hitler and blamed Himmler or other subordinates for their troubles. From late 1943, fear of the advancing Soviets and prospects of a military offensive from the Western Powers eclipsed resentment at the regime and if anything hardened the will to resist the advancing allies.\n\n== Open protest ==\nAcross the twentieth century public protest comprised a primary form of civilian opposition within [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] regimes. Potentially influential popular protests required not only public expression but the collection of a crowd of persons speaking with one voice. In addition, only protests which caused the regime to take notice and respond to are included here.\n\nImprovised protests also occurred if rarely in [[Nazi Germany]], and represent a form of resistance not wholly researched, Sybil Milton wrote already in 1984.<ref>Sybil Milton, \u201cWomen and the Holocaust,\u201d in when Biology became Destiny.</ref> [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] and [[National-socialism|National Socialism]]\u2019s perceived dependence on the mass mobilization of his people, the \u201cracial\u201d Germans, along with the belief that Germany had lost WW I due to an unstable home front, caused the regime to be peculiarly sensitive to public, collective protests. Hitler recognized the power of collective action, advocated non-compliance toward unworthy authority (e.g. the 1923 French occupation of the Ruhr), and brought his party to power in part by mobilizing public unrest and disorder to further discredit the Weimar Republic.<ref>Hitler ''Mein Kampf,'' 1939: 465, 780, 81</ref> In power, Nazi leaders quickly banned extra-party demonstrations, fearing displays of dissent on open urban spaces might develop and grow, even without organization.  \n\nTo direct attention away from dissent, the Nazi state appeased some public, collective protests by \u201cracial\u201d Germans and ignored but did not repress others, both before and during the war. The regime rationalized appeasement of public protests as temporary measures to maintain the appearance of German unity and reduce the risk of alienating the public through blatant Gestapo repression. Examples of compromises for tactical reasons include social and material concessions to workers, deferment of punishing oppositional church leaders, \u201ctemporary\u201d exemptions of intermarried Jews from the Holocaust, failure to punish hundreds of thousands of women for disregarding Hitler's \u2018total war\u2019 decree conscripting women into the work force, and rejection of coercion to enforce civilian evacuations from urban areas bombed by the Allies.\n\nAn early defeat of state institutions and Nazi officials by mass, popular protest culminated with Hitler's release and reinstatement to church office of Protestant bishops [[Hans Meiser (bishop)|Hans Meiser]] and [[Theophil Wurm]] in October 1934.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Popular opinion and political dissent in the Third Reich, Bavaria 1933-1945|last=Ian|first=Kershaw|date=2002|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=0199251118|edition=New|location=Oxford|oclc=50479485}}</ref> Meiser's arrest two weeks earlier had stirred mass public protests of thousands in [[Bavaria]] and [[W\u00fcrttemberg]] and initiated protests to the [[German Foreign Ministry]] from countries around the world. Unrest had festered between regional Protestants and the state since early 1934 and came to a boil in mid-September when the regional party daily accused Meiser of treason, and shameful betrayal of Hitler and the state. By the time Hitler intervened, pastors were increasingly involving parishioners in the church struggle. Their agitation was amplifying distrust of the state as protest was worsening and spreading rapidly. Alarm among local officials was escalating. Some six thousand gathered in support of Meiser while only a few dutifully showed up at a meeting of the region's party leader, [[Julius Streicher]]. Mass open protests, the form of agitation and bandwagon building the Nazis employed so successfully, were now working against them. When Streicher's deputy, [[Karl Holz (Nazi)|Karl Holz]], held a mass rally in [[Nuremberg|Nuremberg's]] main square, Adolf-Hitler-Platz, the director of the city's Protestant Seminary led his students into the square, encouraging others along the way to join, where they effectively sabotaged the Nazi rally and broke out singing \u201cA Mighty Fortress is our God.\u201d To rehabilitate Meiser and bring the standoff to a close, Hitler, who in January had publicly condemned the bishops in their presence as \u201ctraitors to the people, enemies of the Fatherland, and the destroyers of Germany,\u201d arranged a mass audience including the bishops and spoke in conciliatory tones.<ref name=\":3\">Kuller, Christiane (2015). Stoltzfus, Nathan; Maier-Katkin, Birgit, eds. ''Protest in Hitler's \"National Community\": Popular Unrest and the Nazi Response''. New York: Berghahn Books.</ref>\n\nThis early contest points to enduring characteristics of regime responses to open, collective protests. It would prefer dealing with mass dissent immediately and decisively\u2014not uncommonly retracting the cause of protest with local and policy-specific concessions. Open dissent, left unchecked, tended to spread and worsen. Church leaders had improvised a counter-demonstration strong enough to neutralize the party's rally just as the Nazi Party had faced down socialist and communist demonstrators while coming to power.<ref name=\":2\" /> Instructive in this case is the view of a high state official that, regardless of the protesters motives, they were political in effect; although church protests were in defense of traditions rather than an attack on the regime, they nonetheless had political consequences, the official said, with many perceiving the clergy as anti-Nazi, and a \u201cgreat danger of the issue spilling over from a church affair into the political arena\u201d.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nHitler recognized that workers, through repeated strikes, might force approval of their demands and he made concessions to workers in order to preempt unrest; yet the rare but forceful public protests the regime faced were by women and Catholics, primarily. Some of the earliest work on resistance examined the Catholic record, including most spectacularly local and regional protests against decrees removing crucifixes from schools, part of the regime's effort to secularize public life.<ref>Neuh\u00e4ser, J. (1946) ''Kreuz und Hakenkreuz: Der Kampf des Nationalsozialismus gegen die katholische Kirche und der kirchliche Widerstand''. Munich: Katholische Kirche Bayerns. ASIN B0017W366U.</ref> Although historians dispute the degree of political antagonism toward National Socialism behind these protests, their impact is uncontested. Popular, public, improvised protests against decrees replacing crucifixes with the [[F\u00fchrer|F\u00fchrer's]] picture, in incidents from 1935 to 1941, from north to south and east to west in Germany, forced state and party leaders to back away and leave crucifixes in traditional places. Prominent incidents of crucifix removal decrees, followed by protests and official retreat, occurred in Oldenburg (Lower Saxony) in 1936, Frankenholz (Saarland) and Frauenberg (East Prussia) in 1937, and in Bavaria in 1941. Women, with traditional sway over children and their spiritual welfare, played a leading part.<ref>Kuropka, J. (1987) ''Das Kreuz: Untersuchungen zur Geschichte des Konflikts um Kreuz und Lutherbild in den Schulen Oldenburgs, zur Wirkungsgeschichte eines in einer agrarisch katholischen Region.''Aschendorff, M\u00fcnster: Oldenburgische Volkszeitung.</ref>\n\nGerman history of the early twentieth century held examples of the power of public mobilization, including the [[Kapp Putsch|Kapp military Putsch]] in 1920, some civilian Germans realized the specific potential of public protest from within the dictatorship. After the Oldenburg [[Crucifix Decrees|crucifix struggle]], police reported that Catholic activists told each other they could defeat future anti-Catholic actions of the state as long as they posed a united front''.'' Catholic Bishop [[Clemens August Graf von Galen|Clemens von Galen]] may well have been among them. He had raised his voice in the struggle, circulating a pastoral letter. A few months later in early 1937, while other bishops voiced fear of using such \u201cdirect confrontation,\u201d Galen favored selective \u201cpublic protests\u201d as a means of defending church traditions against an overreaching state<ref>Beth Griech-Polelle (2002, 1), ''Bishop von Galen: German Catholicism and National Socialism.''</ref>''.''\n\nSome argue that the regime, once at war, no longer heeded popular opinion and, some agencies and authorities did radicalize use of terror for domestic control in the final phase of war. Hitler and the regime's response to collective street protest, however, did not harden. Although a number of historians have argued that popular opinion, brought to a head by Galen's denunciations from the pulpit in the late summer of 1941, caused Hitler to suspend Nazi \u201c[[Euthanasia in Nazi Germany|Euthanasia]],\u201d others disagree. It is certain, however, that Galen intended to have an impact from the pulpit and that the highest Nazi officials decided against punishing him out of concern for public morale.<ref>E. D. R. Harrison (1994: 354), \u201cThe Nazi Dissolution of the Monasteries: A Case-Study,\u201d in''The English Historical Review'', 109, 431 (April).</ref> A Catholic protest in May the same year against the closing of the M\u00fcnsterschwarzach monastery in Lower Franconia illustrates the regime's occasional response of not meeting protester demands while nevertheless responding with \u201cflexibility\u201d and \u201cleniency\u201d rather than repressing or punishing protesters.<ref>Jonathan D\u00fcring, ''Wir weichen nur der Gewalt: Die M\u00f6nche von M\u00fcnsterschwarzach im Dritten Reich'', vol. 2, M\u00fcnsterschwarzach 1997.</ref> That protest, however, represented only local opinion rather than the nationwide anxiety Galen represented, stirred up by the Euthanasia program the regime refused to acknowledge.\n\nAnother indication that civilians realized the potential of public protest within a regime so concerned about morale and unity, is from [[Margarete Sommer]]s of the Catholic Welfare Office in the Berlin Diocese. Following the [[Rosenstrasse protest|Rosenstrasse Protest]] of late winter 1943. Sommers, who shared with colleagues an assumption that \u201cthe people could mobilize against the regime on behalf of specific values,\u201d wrote that the women had succeeded through \u201cloudly voiced protests\u201d.<ref>Leugers, A.

Police guards repeatedly scattered the women, gathered in groups of up to hundreds, with shouts of \u201cclear the street or we\u2019ll shoot.\u201d As the police repeatedly failed to shoot, some protesters began to think their action might prevail. One said that if she had first calculated whether a protest could have succeeded, she would have stayed home. Instead, \u201cwe acted from the heart,\u201d she said, adding that the women were capable of such courageous action because their husbands were in grave danger.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=Resistance of the heart : intermarriage and the Rosenstrasse protest in Nazi Germany|last=Nathan.|first=Stoltzfus|date=2001|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=0813529093|location=New Brunswick, N.J.|oclc=44764115}}</ref> Some 7,000 of the last Jews in Berlin arrested at this time were sent to Auschwitz.

Leugers (2004).</ref>\n\nAnother potential indication that German civilians realized the power of public protest was in [[Dortmund-H\u00f6rde station|Dortmund-H\u00f6rde]] in April 1943. According to an SD Report from July 8 of 1943, in the early afternoon of April 12, 1943, an army captain arrested a Flak soldier in Dortmund- H\u00f6rde because of an insolent salute. The townsfolk looking on took his side. A crowd formed of three to four hundred comprised essentially of women. The crowd shouted lines such as \u201cGebt uns unsere M\u00e4nner wieder\u201d or \u201cgive us our men back\u201d which suggest some in the crowd were aware of the protest on [[Rosenstrasse protest|Rosenstrassse]]. The recentness of the weeklong protest on Rosenstrasse strengthens this possibility. On Rosenstrasse the chant had been coined as the rallying cry of wives for their incarcerated husbands. Here on behalf of one man it made little sense.\n\n[[Rosenstrasse protest|Rosenstrasse]] was the only open, collective protest for Jews during the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]], and in the estimation of historians over the decades, it rescued some 2,000 intermarried Jews. They were \u201cfull\u201d Jews in the sense of the 1935 Nuremberg Laws and the Gestapo aimed to deport as many as it could without drawing attention to the Holocaust or alienating the \u201cracial\u201d public, according to.<ref>Stoltzfus (2005, 450-9) in Historical Evidence and Plausible History, ''Central European History 38 (3).''</ref> Auschwitz records show that SS officials were expecting additional laborers from Berlin, most likely those imprisoned at Rosenstrasse, just as the regime was intent on deporting the last Jews from German soil.<ref>Joachim Neander (2004: 196-202), \u201cDie Rosenstrasse von au\u00dfen gesehen\u2014Wechsel der Perspektiven,\u201d in A.

Under increasing [[Allied-occupied Germany|Allied]] bombardments, officials had struggled to establish an orderly program for evacuation.

In this context, ordinary Germans were sometimes able to exact limited concessions, as Goebbels worried that a growing number of Germans were becoming aware of the regime's soft spot represented by its response to protests.\n\n==Disorganized resistance==\n[[File:Ehrenfeld Gedenktafel Edelwei\u00dfpiraten.jpg|thumb|Memorial to the \"Edelweisspiraten\" youth group, six of whom were hanged in Cologne in 1944]]\n\nIt cannot be disputed that many Germans supported the regime until the end of the war. But beneath the surface of German society there were also currents of resistance, if not always consciously political. The German historian [[Detlev Peukert]], who pioneered the study of German society during the Nazi era, called this phenomenon \"everyday resistance.\" His research was based partly on the regular reports by the Gestapo and the SD on morale and public opinion, and on the \"Reports on Germany\" which were produced by the exiled SPD based on information from its underground network in Germany and which were acknowledged to be very well informed.\n\nPeukert and other writers have shown that the most persistent sources of dissatisfaction in Nazi Germany were the state of the economy and anger at the corruption of Nazi Party officials &mdash; although these rarely affected the personal popularity of Hitler himself. The Nazi regime is frequently credited with \"curing unemployment,\" but this was done mainly by conscription and rearmament &mdash; the civilian economy remained weak throughout the Nazi period. Although prices were fixed by law, wages remained low and there were acute shortages, particularly once the war started. To this after 1942 was added the acute misery caused by Allied air attacks on German cities. The high living and venality of Nazi officials such as [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] aroused increasing anger. The result was \"deep dissatisfaction among the population of all parts of the country, caused by failings in the economy, government intrusions into private life, disruption of accepted tradition and custom, and police-state controls.\"<ref>[[Gordon A. Craig]], ''New York Review of Books'', 12 July 1987 (reviewing Peukert's book ''Inside Nazi Germany'')</ref>\n\n[[Otto and Elise Hampel]] protested the regime by leaving postcards urging resistance (both passive and forceful) against the regime around Berlin. It took two years before they were caught, convicted and then put to death.\n\nOpposition based on this widespread dissatisfaction usually took \"passive\" forms &mdash; absenteeism, malingering, spreading rumours, trading on the black market, hoarding, avoiding various forms of state service such as donations to Nazi causes. But sometimes it took more active forms, such as warning people about to be arrested, hiding them or helping them to escape, or turning a blind eye to oppositionist activities. Among the industrial working class, where the underground SPD and KPD networks were always active, there were frequent if short-lived strikes. These were generally tolerated, at least before the outbreak of war, provided the demands of the strikers were purely economic and not political.\n\nAnother form of resistance was assisting the persecuted German Jews. By mid-1942 the deportation of German and Austrian Jews to the [[extermination camps]] in occupied Poland was well under way. It is argued by some writers that the great majority of Germans were indifferent to the fate of the Jews, and a substantial proportion actively supported the Nazi programme of extermination.<ref>Eric Johnson and Karl-Heinz Reuband, ''What We Knew: Terror, Mass Murder and Everyday Life in Nazi Germany'', chapter 13</ref> But a minority persisted in trying to help Jews, even in the face of serious risk to themselves and their families. This was most pronounced in Berlin, where the Gestapo and SS were headquartered, but also where thousands of non-Jewish Berliners, some with powerful connections, risked hiding their Jewish neighbors.<ref name=\"Gilbert 2004\">{{cite book | last=Gilbert | first=Martin | title=The Righteous: The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust | publisher=H.

In [[Wieblingen]] in Baden, [[Elisabeth von Thadden]], a private girls' school principal, disregarded official edicts and continued to enroll Jewish girls at her school until May 1941 when the school was nationalised and she was dismissed (she was executed in 1944, following the [[Frau Solf Tea Party]]). A Berlin Protestant Minister, [[Heinrich Gr\u00fcber]], organised the smuggling of Jews to the [[Netherlands]]. At the Foreign Office, Canaris conspired to send a number of Jews to Switzerland under various pretexts. It is estimated that 2,000 Jews were hidden in Berlin until the end of the war. [[Martin Gilbert]] has documented numerous cases of Germans and Austrians, including officials and Army officers, who saved the lives of Jews.<ref>Martin Gilbert, ''The Righteous: The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust'', chapters 8 and 9</ref>\n\n[[File:Rosenstrasse Berlin.jpg|thumb|Berlin's Rosenstrasse, where the only public protest against the deportation of German Jews took place in 1943]]\n\nThe [[Rosenstrasse protest]] of February 1943 was sparked by the arrest and threatened deportation to death camps of 1,800 Jewish men married to non-Jewish women. Before these men could be deported, their wives and other relatives rallied outside the building in Rosenstrasse where the men were held. About 6,000 people, mostly women, rallied in shifts in the winter cold for over a week. Eventually Himmler, worried about the effect on civilian morale, gave in and allowed the arrested men to be released. Some who had already been deported and were on their way to [[Auschwitz]] were brought back. There was no retaliation against the protesters, and most of the Jewish men survived.\n\nNazism had a powerful appeal to German youth, particularly middle-class youth, and German universities were strongholds of Nazism even before Hitler came to power. The [[Hitler Youth]] sought to mobilise all young Germans behind the regime, and apart from stubborn resistance in some rural Catholic areas, was generally successful in the first period of Nazi rule. After about 1938, however, persistent alienation among some sections of German youth began to appear. This rarely took the form of overt political opposition &mdash; the [[White Rose]] group was a striking exception, but was striking mainly for its uniqueness. Much more common was what would now be called \"dropping out\" &mdash; a passive refusal to take part in official youth culture and a search for alternatives. Although none of the unofficial youth groups amounted to a serious threat to the Nazi regime, and although they provided no aid or comfort to those groups within the German elite who were actively plotting against Hitler, they do serve to show that there were currents of opposition at other levels of German society.\n\nExamples were the so-called ''[[Edelweiss Pirates|Edelweisspiraten]]'' (\"Edelweiss Pirates\"), a loose network of working-class youth groups in a number of cities, who held unauthorised meetings and engaged in street fights with the Hitler Youth; the [[Leipzig Meuten|Meuten]] group in [[Leipzig]], a more politicised group with links to the KPD underground, which had more than a thousand members in the late 1930s; and, most notably, the ''[[Swing Kids|Swingjugend]]'', middle-class youth who met in secret clubs in Berlin and most other large cities to listen to [[Swing (genre)|swing]], [[jazz]] and other music deemed \"degenerate\" by the Nazi authorities. This movement, which involved distinctive forms of dress and gradually become more consciously political, became so popular that it provoked a crackdown: in 1941 Himmler ordered the arrest of Swing activists and had some sent to concentration camps.\n\nIn October 1944, as the American and British armies approached the western borders of Germany, there was a serious outbreak of disorder in the bomb-ravaged city of [[Cologne]], which had been largely evacuated. The ''Edelweisspiraten'' linked up with gangs of deserters, escaped prisoners and foreign workers, and the underground KPD network, to engage in looting and sabotage, and the assassination of Gestapo and Nazi Party officials. Explosives were stolen with the objective of blowing up the Gestapo headquarters. Himmler, fearing the resistance would spread to other cities as the Allied armies advanced into Germany, ordered a savage crackdown, and for days gunbattles raged in the ruined streets of Cologne. More than 200 people were arrested and dozens were hanged in public, among them six teenaged ''Edelweisspiraten'', including [[Bartholom\u00e4us Schink]].<ref>Ian Kershaw, ''Hitler 1936&ndash;1945: Nemesis'', 704</ref>\n\n==Relations with Allies==\nThe various groups of German resistance against the Nazi government had different attitudes to the Allies. The most visible resistance group of the July 20 plot wasn't interested in dealing with all the Allies, and pressed demands against such Allied countries as Poland and the Soviet Union; some of its members were involved in atrocities against people in these countries. In particular the July 20th plotters demanded in their proposals to occupy Poland and annex its territory, while occupying the rest of East Europe and continuing war with the Soviet Union. The token representative of the July 20 Group, Claus von Stauffenberg, was known for his support towards German colonization of Poland as well as racist remarks regarding Polish Jews.<ref name=\"Martyn\">{{Cite book | last=Housden | first=Martyn | title=Resistance and Conformity in the Third Reich | year=1997 | publisher=Routledge | location=New York  | isbn=978-0-415-12134-7 | pages=}} page 100: \"He was endorsing both the tyrannical occupation of Poland and the use of its people as slave labourers\"</ref><ref name=\"Hoffman\">{{cite book|author=Peter Hoffman |title=Stauffenberg: A Family History, 1905\u20131944|page=116|year=2003 |publisher=McGill-Queen's Press}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~semp/germans.htm|title=Germans against Hitler.

While English historians too have criticized the unconditional surrender, most of them agree that it had no real impact on the final outcome of the war.<ref>'Getting History Right' East and West German Collective Memories of the Holocaust and War, page 120, Mark Wolfgram, Lexington Books 2010</ref>\nPrior to the formulation of unconditional surrender by the Allies,  the peace demands sent from the German resistance were hardly satisfactory; for example in 1941 a proposal by Goerdeler demanded borders of 1914 with France, Belgium and Poland, as well as acceptance of annexation of Austria and Sudetenland.<ref name=\"'Getting History Right' page 120\">'Getting History Right' page 120</ref>\n\nWhile German popular memory and public discourse portrays the resistance as isolated due to demand of unconditional surrender, in reality its isolation was due to unrealistic expectations of what the Allies would accept; while German commentators write that the resistance tried \"to save that which remained to be saved\", they omit the fact that it included a significant portion of territories conquered by Nazi Germany from its neighbours.<ref name=\"'Getting History Right' page 120\"/>\n\nA [[SHAEF]] directive prohibited activities aimed at promoting German revolt against the Nazi regime.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.psupress.psu.edu/books/titles/0-271-02314-7.html |title=Arthur D.

On the contrary, they have again and again welded together the people and the Nazis by statements published, either out of indifference or with a purpose. To take a recent example, the Morgenthau plan gave Dr. Goebbels the best possible chance. He was able to prove to his countrymen, in black and white, that the enemy planned the enslavement of Germany. The conviction that Germany had nothing to expect from defeat but oppression and exploitation still prevails, and that accounts for the fact that the Germans continue to fight. It is not a question of a regime, but of the homeland itself, and to save that, every German is bound to obey the call, whether he be Nazi or member of the opposition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/psf/box32/t298m01.html|title=Home - FDR Presidential Library & Museum|publisher=}}</ref> </blockquote>\n\nOn 20 July 1945 &mdash; the first anniversary of the failed attempt to kill Hitler &mdash; no mention whatsoever was made of the event. This was because reminding the German population of the fact that there had been active German resistance to Hitler would undermine the Allied efforts to instill a sense of [[collective guilt]] in the German populace.<ref>Michael R.

Soldatengrab.jpg|thumb|upright|The grave of a German soldier, Heinz K\u00fchl, on the [[Kursk]] battlefield]]\nBy mid-1943 the tide of war was turning decisively against Germany. The last major German offensive on the Eastern Front, [[Battle of Kursk|Operation Citadel]], ended in the defeat for the Germans at [[Kursk]], and in July 1943 [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] was overthrown. The Army and civilian plotters became more convinced than ever that Hitler must be assassinated so that a government acceptable to the western Allies could be formed and a separate peace negotiated in time to prevent a Soviet invasion of Germany. This scenario, while more credible than some of the resistance's earlier plans, was based on a [[false premise]]: that the western Allies would be willing to break with Stalin and negotiate a separate peace with a non-Nazi German government. In fact both [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] were committed to the \u201cunconditional surrender\u201d formula.\n\nSince the Foreign Office was a stronghold of resistance activists, it was not difficult for the conspirators to reach the Allies via diplomats in neutral countries. Theo Kordt, based in the German Embassy in [[Bern]], and advised by the Foreign Officers resisters Ulrich von Hassell and Adam von Trott zu Solz, communicated with the British via intermediaries such as [[Willem Visser 't Hooft]], secretary-general of the [[World Council of Churches]], based in [[Geneva]]. The Kreisau Circle sent [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]] and Helmut von Moltke to meet [[George Bell (bishop)|George Bell]], [[Bishop of Chichester]], at a church conference in [[Stockholm]]. Bell passed their messages and plans on to Foreign Secretary [[Anthony Eden]]. An American journalist, [[Louis P. Lochner]], carried coded messages out of Germany and took them to Roosevelt. Other envoys worked through Vatican channels, or via diplomats in [[Lisbon]] \u2013 a recognised site for indirect communication between Germany and the Allied countries.\n\nAll of these overtures were rejected, and indeed they were usually simply ignored. The western Allies would give the German resistance no assistance or even recognition. There were several reasons for this. First, they did not know or trust the resisters, who seemed to them to be a clique of Prussian reactionaries concerned mainly to save their own skins now that Germany was losing the war. This attitude was encouraged by visceral anti-Germans such as [[Robert Gilbert Vansittart|Lord Vansittart]], Churchill's diplomatic adviser, who regarded all Germans as evil. Second, Roosevelt and Churchill were both acutely aware that the Soviet Union was bearing the brunt of the war against Hitler, and were aware of Stalin's constant suspicions that they were doing deals behind his back. They thus refused any discussions that might be seen as suggesting a willingness to reach a separate peace with Germany. Third, the Allies were determined that in [[World War II]], unlike in [[World War I]], Germany must be comprehensively defeated in the field so that another [[Dolchstosslegende|\"stab in the back\" myth]] would not to arise in Germany.\n\nOlbricht now put forward a new strategy for staging a coup against Hitler. The Reserve Army had an operational plan called Operation Valkyrie, which was to be used if the disruption caused by the Allied bombing of German cities caused a breakdown in law and order, or a rising by the millions of slave labourers from occupied countries now being used in German factories. Olbricht suggested that this plan could be used to mobilise the Reserve Army to stage a coup. In the autumn of 1943, Tresckow revised Valkyrie plan and drafted supplemental orders to take control of German cities, disarm the SS and arrest the Nazi leadership after Hitler's assassination. Operation Valkyrie could only be put into effect by General [[Friedrich Fromm]], commander of the Reserve Army, so he must either be won over to the conspiracy or in some way neutralised if the plan was to succeed. Fromm, like many senior officers, knew about the military conspiracies against Hitler but neither supported them nor reported them to the Gestapo.\n\n[[File:Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg - Helmuth James Graf von Moltke.jpg|thumb|A German stamp of [[Claus von Stauffenberg|Claus Philipp Maria Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg]] and [[Helmuth James Graf von Moltke]] in commemoration of their 100th birthdays]]\n\nIn August 1943 Tresckow met a young staff officer, Colonel [[Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg]], for the first time. Badly wounded in North Africa, Stauffenberg was a devout Catholic, a political conservative and a zealous German nationalist with a taste for philosophy. He had at first welcomed the Nazi regime but had become rapidly disillusioned. By 1942 he shared the widespread conviction among Army officers that Germany was being led to disaster and that Hitler must be removed from power. For some time his religious scruples had prevented him from coming to the conclusion that assassination was the correct way to achieve this. After Stalingrad, however, he decided that ''not'' assassinating Hitler would be a greater moral evil.\n\nDuring late 1943 and early 1944 there were a series of attempts to get one of the military conspirators near enough to Hitler for long enough to kill him with a bomb or a revolver. But the task was becoming increasingly difficult. As the war situation deteriorated, Hitler no longer appeared in public and rarely visited Berlin. He spent most of his time at his headquarters in East Prussia, with occasional breaks at his Bavarian mountain retreat in [[Berchtesgaden]]. In both places he was heavily guarded and rarely saw people he did not already know and trust. Himmler and the Gestapo were increasingly suspicious of plots against Hitler, and specifically suspected the officers of the General Staff, which was indeed the place where most of the young officers willing to sacrifice themselves to kill Hitler were located. All these attempts therefore failed, sometimes by a matter of minutes.\n\n<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:JuliusLeber.jpg|thumb|[[Julius Leber]]]] -->\nFurther blows came in January and February 1944 when first Moltke and then Canaris were arrested. By the summer of 1944 the Gestapo was closing in on the conspirators. On 4 July [[Julius Leber]], who was trying to establish contact between his own underground SPD network and the KPD's network in the interests of the \u201cunited front,\u201d was arrested after attending a meeting which had been infiltrated by the Gestapo. There was a sense that time was running out, both on the battlefield, where the eastern front was in full retreat and where the Allies had landed in France on [[D-Day|6 June]], and in Germany, where the resistance's room for manoeuvre was rapidly contracting. The belief that this was the last chance for action seized the conspirators. Few now believed that the Allies would agree to a separate peace with a non-Nazi government, even if Hitler was assassinated. Leber in particular had argued that \u201cunconditional surrender\u201d was inevitable and the only question was whether it would be before or after the Soviets invaded Germany.\n\nBy this time the core of the conspirators had begun to think of themselves as doomed men, whose actions were more symbolic than real. The purpose of the conspiracy was seen by some of them as saving the honour of themselves, their families, the Army and Germany through a grand, if futile, gesture, rather than altering the course of history. Tresckow said to Stauffenberg through one of his aides, Lieutenant [[Heinrich Graf von Lehndorff-Steinort]]: \u201cThe assassination must be attempted, ''co\u00fbte que co\u00fbte'' [whatever the cost]. Even if it fails, we must take action in Berlin. For the practical purpose no longer matters; what matters now is that the German resistance movement must take the plunge before the eyes of the world and of history. Compared to that, nothing else matters.\u201d<ref>Graefin-Doenhoff, \"Um der Ehre Willen: Erinnerungen an die Freunde vom 20. Juli\", 72</ref><ref>Joachim Fest, ''Plotting Hitler\u2019s Death: The German Resistance to Hitler 1933&ndash;1945'', 236</ref>\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146III-347, Werner Karl v. Haeften.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Werner von Haeften|Werner Karl von Haeften]]]]\n\nIn retrospect it is surprising that these months of plotting by the resistance groups in the Army and the state apparatus, in which dozens of people were involved and of which many more, including very senior Army officers, were aware, apparently totally escaped the attentions of the Gestapo. In fact, as was noted earlier, the Gestapo had known since February 1943 of both the Abwehr resistance group under the patronage of Canaris and of the Goedeler-Beck circle. If all these people had been arrested and interrogated, the Gestapo might well have uncovered the group based in Army Group Centre as well and the July 20 assassination attempt would never have happened. This raises the possibility that Himmler knew about the plot and, for reasons of his own, allowed it to go ahead.\n\nHimmler had had at least one conversation with a known oppositionist when, in August 1943, the Prussian Finance Minister Johannes Popitz came to see him and offered him the support of the opposition if he would make a move to displace Hitler and secure a negotiated end to the war.<ref>Joachim Fest, ''Plotting Hitler's Death'', 228</ref> Nothing came of this meeting, but Popitz was not arrested and Himmler apparently did nothing to track down the resistance network which he knew was operating within the state bureaucracy. It is possible that Himmler, who by late 1943 knew that the war was unwinnable, allowed the July 20 plot to go ahead in the knowledge that if it succeeded he would be Hitler's successor, and could then lead to a peace settlement. Popitz was not alone in seeing in Himmler a potential ally. General von Bock advised Tresckow to seek his support, but there is no evidence that he did so. Gordeler was apparently also in indirect contact with Himmler via a mutual acquaintance [[Carl Langbehn]]. Canaris's biographer [[Heinz H\u00f6hne]] suggests that Canaris and Himmler were working together to bring about a change of regime. All of this remains speculation.<ref>Himmler's contacts with the opposition and his possible motives are discussed by Peter Padfield, ''Himmler'', 419&ndash;424</ref>\n\nHimmler in fact knew more about the real level of opposition to the Nazi regime than did the opposition itself. To the resistance activists it seemed that the German people continued to place their faith in Hitler no matter how dire the military and economic situation had become. But Himmler was receiving regular reports from the [[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]] (Security Service, the intelligence arm of the SS), about the real state of German morale. These were compiled by SS-Gruppenf\u00fcher [[Otto Ohlendorf]] and were drawn from the SD's wide range of contacts all over Germany. They showed a sharp decline in civilian morale and in the level of support for the Nazi regime, beginning after Stalingrad and accelerating through 1943 as the military setbacks continued, the economic situation deteriorated and the Allied bombing of German cities grew more intense. By the end of 1943 Himmler knew that most Germans no longer believed that war could be won and that many, perhaps a majority, had lost faith in Hitler.<ref>Peter Padfield, ''Himmler'', 419</ref> But fear of the Gestapo meant that this disillusionment did not translate into political opposition to the regime &mdash; even though, as the [[Rosenstrasse protest]] showed, it was possible even as late as 1943 for courageous opponents of Nazi policies to make public and successful protests.\n\nNevertheless, organised resistance begun to stir during 1944. While the SPD and KPD trade unions had been destroyed in 1933, the Catholic unions had voluntarily dissolved along with the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]]. As a result, Catholic unionists had been less zealously repressed than their socialist counterparts, and had maintained an informal network of activists. Their leaders, [[Jakob Kaiser]] and Max Habermann, judged by the beginning of 1944 that it was time to take action. They organised a network of resistance cells in government offices across Germany, ready to rise and take control of their buildings when the word was given by the military that Hitler was dead.\n\n==20 July plot==\n{{Main|20 July plot}}\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| footer    = {{FIAV|proposal}} Two variants of [[Josef Wirmer]]'s 1944 \"Resistance\" design, created by his brother, Ernst.

This position enabled Stauffenberg to attend Hitler's military conferences, either in East Prussia or at Berchtesgaden, and would thus give him a golden opportunity, perhaps the last that would present itself, to kill Hitler with a bomb or a pistol. Conspirators who had long resisted on moral grounds the idea of killing Hitler now changed their minds \u2013 partly because they were hearing reports of the mass murder at [[Auschwitz]] of up to 400,000 Hungarian Jews, the culmination of the Nazi [[Holocaust]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Meanwhile, new key allies had been gained. These included General [[Carl-Heinrich von St\u00fclpnagel]], the German military commander in France, who would take control in Paris when Hitler was killed and, it was hoped, negotiate an immediate armistice with the invading Allied armies. The demands of the plotters regarding armistice with Allies included Germany retaining its 1914 eastern borders, including the Polish territories of [[Wielkopolska]] and [[Pozna\u0144]].<ref>\"Review of 'Claus Graf Stauffenberg. 15.

Carsten ''International Affairs'', Vol. 43, No. 2 (April 1967). \"It is more surprising that, as late as May 1944, Stauffenberg still demanded for Germany the frontiers of 1914 in the east, i.e., a new partition of Poland.\"</ref> Other demands included keeping such territorial gains as [[Austria]] and the [[Sudetenland]] within the Reich, giving autonomy to [[Alsace-Lorraine]], and even expansion of the current wartime borders of Germany in the south by annexing Tyrol as far as [[Bolzano]] and [[Merano]]. Non-territorial demands included such points as refusal of any occupation of Germany by the Allies, as well as refusal to hand over war criminals by demanding the right of \"nations to deal with their own criminals\". These proposals were only directed to the Western Allies \u2013 Stauffenberg wanted Germany only to retreat from western, southern and northern positions, while demanding the right to continue military occupation of German territorial gains in the east.<ref name=\"Martyn2\">Martyn Housden,\"Resistance and Conformity in the Third Reich\";Routledge 1997;page 109\u2013110</ref>\n\nThe plot was now as ready as it would ever be. Twice in early July Stauffenberg attended Hitler's conferences carrying a bomb in his briefcase. But because the conspirators had decided that Himmler, too, must be assassinated if the planned mobilisation of Operation Valkyrie was to have any chance of success, he had held back at the last minute because Himmler was not present \u2013 in fact it was unusual for Himmler to attend military conferences. By 15 July, when Stauffenberg again flew to East Prussia, this condition had been dropped. The plan was for Stauffenberg to plant the briefcase with the bomb in Hitler's conference room with a timer running, excuse himself from the meeting, wait for the explosion, then fly back to Berlin and join the other plotters at the Bendlerblock. Operation Valkyrie would be mobilised, the Reserve Army would take control of Germany and the other Nazi leaders would be arrested. Beck would be appointed head of state, [[Carl Friedrich Goerdeler|Goerdeler]] Chancellor and [[Erwin von Witzleben|Witzleben]] commander-in-chief. The plan was ambitious and depended on a run of very good luck, but it was not totally fanciful.\n\n==Rastenburg==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1972-025-10, Hitler-Attentat, 20.

Stauffenberg, depressed and angry, returned to Berlin. On 18 July rumours reached him that the Gestapo had wind of the conspiracy and that he might be arrested at any time \u2013 this was apparently not true, but there was a sense that the net was closing in and that the next opportunity to kill Hitler must be taken because there might not be another. At 10:00 hours on 20 July Stauffenberg flew back to the [[Wolfsschanze]] for another Hitler military conference, again with a bomb in his briefcase. It is remarkable in retrospect that despite Hitler's mania for security, officers attending his conferences were not searched.\n\nAt about 12:10 the conference began. Stauffenberg, having previously activated the timer on the bomb, placed his briefcase under the table around which Hitler and more than 20 officers were seated or standing. After ten minutes, he made an excuse and left the room. At 12:40 the bomb went off, demolishing the conference room. Several officers were killed, but not Hitler. Possibly he had been saved because the heavy oak leg of the conference table, behind which Stauffenberg's briefcase had been left, deflected the blast. But Stauffenberg, seeing the building collapse in smoke and flame, assumed Hitler was dead, leapt into a staff car and made a dash for the airfield before the alarm could be raised. By 13:00 he was airborne.\n\nBy the time Stauffenberg's plane reached Berlin at about 15:00, General [[Erich Fellgiebel]], an officer at Rastenburg who was in on the plot, had rung the Bendlerblock and told the plotters that Hitler had survived the explosion. This was a fatal step (literally so for Fellgiebel and many others), because the Berlin plotters immediately lost their nerve, and judged, probably correctly, that the plan to mobilise Operation Valkyrie would have no chance of succeeding once the officers of the Reserve Army knew that Hitler was alive. There was more confusion when Stauffenberg's plane landed and he phoned from the airport to say that Hitler was dead. The Bendlerblock plotters did not know whom to believe. Finally at 16:00 Olbricht issued the orders for Operation Valkyrie to be mobilised. The vacillating General Fromm, however, phoned Keitel, who assured him that Hitler was alive, and demanded to know Stauffenberg's whereabouts. This told Fromm that the plot had been traced to his headquarters<!---how? did keitel ask where stuaffenburg was, or did fromm?--->, and that he was in mortal danger.\n\nAt 16:40 Stauffenberg arrived at the Bendlerblock. Fromm now changed sides and attempted to have Stauffenberg arrested, but Olbricht and Stauffenberg restrained him at gunpoint. By this time Himmler had taken charge of the situation and has issued orders countermanding Olbricht's mobilisation of Operation Valkyrie. In many places the coup was going ahead, led by officers who believed that Hitler was dead. The Propaganda Ministry on the [[Wilhelmstrasse]], with [[Joseph Goebbels]] inside, was surrounded by troops. In Paris St\u00fclpnagel issued orders for the arrest of the SS and [[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]] commanders. In Vienna, Prague and many other places troops occupied Nazi Party offices and arrested Gauleiters and SS officers.\n\nThe decisive moment came at 19:00, when Hitler was sufficiently recovered to make phone calls. By phone he personally empowered a loyal officer, Major [[Otto Remer]], to regain control of the situation in Berlin. At 20:00 a furious Witzleben arrived at the Bendlerblock and had a bitter argument with Stauffenberg, who was still insisting that the coup could go ahead. Witzleben left shortly afterwards. At around this time the planned seizure of power in Paris was aborted when Kluge, who had recently been appointed commander-in-chief in the west, learned that Hitler was alive, changed sides with alacrity and had St\u00fclpnagel arrested.\n[[File:Excavated cells from the basement of the Gestapo headquarters.jpg|thumb|The cells of the Gestapo headquarters in Prinz-Albrecht-Strasse, where many of the July 20 plotters and other resistance activists were tortured]]\n\nThe less resolute members of the conspiracy in Berlin also now began to change sides. Fighting broke out in the Bendlerblock between officers supporting and opposing the coup, and Stauffenberg was wounded. By 23:00 Fromm had regained control, hoping by a show of zealous loyalty to save his own skin. Beck, realising the game was up, shot himself \u2013 the first of many suicides in the coming days. Fromm declared that he had convened a court-martial consisting of himself, and had sentenced Olbricht, Stauffenberg and two other officers to death. At 00:10 on 21 July they were shot in the courtyard outside. Others would have been executed as well, but at 00:30 the SS led by [[Otto Skorzeny]] arrived on the scene and further executions were forbidden. The original order given to Otto Remer from Adolf Hitler was to capture the conspirators of the resistance alive. Fromm went off to see Goebbels to claim credit for suppressing the coup. He was immediately arrested.\n\nThat was the end of the German resistance. Over the coming weeks Himmler's Gestapo, driven by a furious Hitler, rounded up nearly everyone who had had the remotest connection with the July 20 plot. The discovery of letters and diaries in the homes and offices of those arrested revealed the plots of 1938, 1939 and 1943, and this led to further rounds of arrests, including that of Halder, who finished the war in a concentration camp. Under Himmler's new [[Sippenhaft]] (blood guilt) laws, all the relatives of the principal plotters were also arrested. Many people killed themselves, including Tresckow, St\u00fclpnagel, Kluge and Rommel (under Hitler's orders).\n\nVery few of the plotters tried to escape, or to deny their guilt when arrested. It was as if they felt that now that honour had been satisfied, there was nothing further to be done. Hassell, who was at home in Bavaria, returned to his office in Berlin and awaited arrest. Others turned themselves in. Some plotters did manage to get away \u2013 Gisevius to Switzerland, for example. Others survived by luck or accident. It appears that none of the conspirators implicated anyone else, even under torture. It was well into August before the Gestapo learned of the Kreisau Circle. Goerdeler was not arrested until August 12.\n\nThose who survived interrogation were given perfunctory trials before the People's Court and its bullying Nazi judge [[Roland Freisler]]. Eventually some 5,000 people were arrested and about 200 were executed<ref>Ian Kershaw, ''Hitler 1936&ndash;1945: Nemesis'', 693</ref> \u2013 not all of them connected with the July 20 plot, since the Gestapo used the occasion to settle scores with many other people suspected of opposition sympathies. After February 3, 1945, when [[Roland Freisler#Death|Freisler was killed]] in [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II#The largest American raid on Berlin|an American air raid]], there were no more formal trials, but as late as April, with the war weeks away from its end, Canaris's diary was found, and many more people were implicated. Executions continued down to the last days of the war.\n\n==Aktion Rheinland==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2019}}\n{{main|Aktion Rheinland}}\nOne of the final acts of resistance was ''Aktion Rheinland'', an operation carried out by the resistance group in [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] led by Karl August Wiedenhofen. The goal was to surrender the city of D\u00fcsseldorf to the advancing [[US Army|Americans]] without any fighting, thereby preventing further destruction. The action occurred during the latter stages of the [[encirclement]] of the [[Ruhr Pocket]], with Wiedenhofen's group briefly taking over police headquarters on 16 April 1945. Despite the plan being betrayed (leading to the execution of five Resistance fighters), other fighters managed to reach American lines, leading to the virtually bloodless capture of the city on 17 April.\n\n==Historiography==\n[[File:Heinrich Vogeler-Das Dritte Reich-1934.jpg|thumbnail|150px|\"The Third Reich\", 1934 painting by the anti-Nazi exile German painter [[Heinrich Vogeler]].]]\n{{Main|Historiography of German resistance to Nazism}}\nHistoriographical debates on the subject on ''Widerstand'' have often featured intense arguments about the nature, extent and effectiveness of resistance in the Third Reich.<ref name=\":1\">Kershaw, Ian ''The Nazi Dictatorship Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation'', London: Arnold Press, 2000 pages 183&ndash;184.</ref> In particular, debate has focused around what to define as ''Widerstand'' (resistance).<ref>Kershaw, Ian ''The Nazi Dictatorship Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation'', London: Arnold Press, 2000 page 184.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Germans who resisted Nazism]]\n* [[List of members of the 20 July plot]]\n* [[Aktion Rheinland]], D\u00fcsseldorf, April 1945.\n* [[Georg Elser]]\n* [[Hermann Braun]] (former [[Nazi]] [[propaganda]] [[film actor]])\n* [[Werner Dankwort]]\n* [[Helmuth H\u00fcbener]]\n* [[Friedrich Kellner]]\n* [[Hugo Launicke]]\n* [[Kurt Nehrling]]\n* [[Friedrich Olbricht]]\n* [[Claus von Stauffenberg]]\n* [[Friedrich Schlotterbeck]]\n* [[Oskar Schindler]]\n* [[Chiune Sugihara]]\n* [[Red Orchestra (espionage)|Red Orchestra]]\n* [[Rudolf Christoph Freiherr von Gersdorff]]\n* [[Robert Uhrig]]\n* [[Schwarze Kapelle]]\n* [[Italian resistance movement]]\n* [[Japanese dissidence during the early Sh\u014dwa period|Japanese dissidence during the early Showa period]]\n* [[Jesuits and Nazi Germany]]\n* [[Austrian Resistance|Austrian Resistance during Nazism, WW II & before]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n;General\n* Harold C.

{"title_page": "Casio CA-53W", "text_new": "{{short description|Digital watch manufactured by Casio}}\nThe '''Casio CA-53W''' is a [[digital watch]] with a built-in calculator manufactured by Japanese electronics company [[Casio]]. Introduced in 1984, it is famous for being similar to the CA-50 calculator watch appearing in the 1985 American [[science fiction]] film ''[[Back To The Future]]''.<ref name=\"g-central\">{{cite web|url=https://www.g-central.com/the-best-casio-calculator-watches/|title=The Best Casio Calculator Watches|date=30 December 2015|work=G-Central|accessdate=19 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n{{Infobox watch\n| name=Casio CA-53W\n| image=Casio CA-53W, 1.jpg\n| caption=Casio CA-53W-1 watch with a plastic case and rubber [[watch strap|strap]]\n| introduced=1984<ref name=\"g-central\"/>\n| type=[[Quartz clock|Quartz]]\n| display=[[Watch#Digital|Digital]]\n| manufacturer = [[Casio]]\n}}\n\n== Specifications ==\n=== Design ===\n\nThe case of the watch measures 43.2 by 34.4 by 8.2&nbsp;millimetres and the watch has a weight of 24&nbsp;grams. The case has a lug-to-lug width of 42&nbsp;millimetres and a thickness of 8&nbsp;millimeters (including the raised area of the case back).<ref name=\"Casio\">{{cite web|url=https://www.casio-intl.com/bd/en/wat/watch_detail/CA-53W-1/|title=Casio CA-53W-1|work=[[Casio]]|accessdate=19 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"menga\"/> The case of the watch is made from plastic along with the watch glass, with a stainless steel case back with the model and module number stamped on it which is secured with four screws. \n\n=== Features ===\n\nThe CA-53W features an 8-digit calculator with basic operators, a 24-hour {{frac|1|100}}&nbsp;second [[stopwatch]] which can measure up to 23:59.99. The stop watch can also record split times and 1st and 2nd place times. Other features include a daily alarm, a full auto calendar upto the year 2099, an hourly signal and a dual time mode. The watch is claimed to be accurate to \u00b115&nbsp;seconds per month and is powered by a [[CR2016]] 3-volt lithium button cell.<ref name=\"Casio\"/> The watch has basic water resistance which means that it is resistant to splashes but is not suitable for showering, snorkeling or swimming. The display of the watch lacks illumination making it unusable in a low light environment.\n\n== Operation ==\n\nThe watch is controlled by a keypad and two side mounted pushers. It has a 4x4 grid calculator keypad with rubber keys consisting of number keys from 0 to 9 along with a decimal place key in the first three columns and the operator keys in the last column. The key pad is marked with secondary functions and is also used for operating other functions of the watch such as operating the stopwatch, turning the alarm on and off and switching from am to pm in time setting mode. On the right side of the watch, there are two small stainless steel pushers with one recessed pusher used to adjust the watch while the other used to switch from mode to mode. The time is set by pressing the adjust pusher once and entering the values for the hours, minutes and seconds by using the keypad. Unlike any other value, the seconds can only be zeroed by pressing the \"0\" key on the keypad. Should this happen before 30 seconds, the watch will zero in at the beginning of the current minute. After 30 seconds it will advance the minutes by one minute. After adjustment of the time, the watch automatically goes to the date setting which can be cancelled by pressing the adjust pusher. Like the time, the date is also set by inputting values via the keypad. The button operation tones of the watch can be switched on and off by pressing the adjust pusher in the calculator mode.\n\nThe display of the watch shows hours, minutes, seconds and day of the week.

The stop watch can also record split times and 1st and 2nd place times. Other features include a daily alarm, a full auto calendar upto the year 2099, an hourly signal and a dual time mode. The watch is claimed to be accurate to \u00b115&nbsp;seconds per month and is powered by a [[CR2016]] 3-volt lithium button cell.<ref name=\"Casio\"/> The watch has basic water resistance which means that it is resistant to splashes but is not suitable for showering, snorkeling or swimming. The display of the watch lacks illumination making it unusable in a low light environment.\n\n== Operation ==\n\nThe watch is controlled by a keypad and two side mounted pushers. It has a 4x4 grid calculator keypad with rubber keys consisting of number keys from 0 to 9 along with a decimal place key in the first three columns and the operator keys in the last column. The key pad is marked with secondary functions and is also used for operating other functions of the watch such as operating the stopwatch, turning the alarm on and off and switching from am to pm in time setting mode. On the right side of the watch, there are two small stainless steel pushers with one recessed pusher used to adjust the watch while the other used to switch from mode to mode. The time is set by pressing the adjust pusher once and entering the values for the hours, minutes and seconds by using the keypad. Unlike any other value, the seconds can only be zeroed by pressing the \"0\" key on the keypad. Should this happen before 30 seconds, the watch will zero in at the beginning of the current minute. After 30 seconds it will advance the minutes by one minute. After adjustment of the time, the watch automatically goes to the date setting which can be cancelled by pressing the adjust pusher. Like the time, the date is also set by inputting values via the keypad. The button operation tones of the watch can be switched on and off by pressing the adjust pusher in the calculator mode.\n\nThe display of the watch shows hours, minutes, seconds and day of the week. The date can be viewed by pressing the division (\u00f7) key on the keypad while in the main time mode. The date is shown in YY/MM/DD format. An \"AM\" sign on the display indicates morning hours and \"PM\" sign on the display indicates afternoon hours. The \"AM\" and \"PM\" indicators disappear when the watch is in 24-hour time keeping mode which is switched on by pressing the addition (+) key in the time setting mode. The alarm is indicated by vertical bars on the top left on the screen while the hourly signal is denoted by a bell icon adjacent to the alarm icon. The display also shows operators selected by the user in calculator mode when performing calcuations.\n\nIn the stopwatch screen, the minutes, seconds and one-hundreths of a second are shown.

The earliest known mechanical musical instruments date back to 9th-century Baghdad. In [[Flanders]], in the early 13th century, a bell ringer invented a cylinder with pins which operate cams, which then hit the bells. (See below.) The popular device best known to us today as a \u201cmusic box\u201d developed from musical [[Decorative boxes#Snuff box|snuff box]]es of the 18th century and were originally called ''carillons \u00e0 musique'' (French for \"chimes of music\"). Some of the more complex boxes also contain a tiny [[drum]] and/or [[bell]]s in addition to the metal comb.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Baud museum mg 8543.jpg|thumb|Typical table music box, with six interchangeable cylinders]]\nThe original snuff boxes were tiny containers which could fit into a gentleman's waistcoat poxes could have any size from that of a hat box to a large piece of furniture, but most were tabletop specimens. They were usually powered by [[clockwork]] and originally produced by artisan [[watchmaker]]s. For most of the 19th century, the bulk of music box production was concentrated in Switzerland, building upon a strong watchmaking tradition. The first music box factory was opened there in 1815 by J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Recordon and Samuel Junod. There were also a few manufacturers in Bohemia and Germany. By the end of the 19th century, some of the European makers had opened factories in the United States.\n\nThe cylinders were normally made of metal and powered by a spring. In some of the costlier models, the cylinders could be removed to change melodies, thanks to an invention by Paillard in 1862, which was perfected by Metert of Geneva in 1879.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} In some exceptional models, there were four springs, to provide continuous play for up to three hours.\n\n[[File:CIMA mg 8302.jpg|thumb|Music box using the metal disk system]]\nThe very first boxes at the end of the 18th century made use of metal disks. The switchover to cylinders seems to have been completed after the Napoleonic wars. In the last decades of the 19th century, however, mass-produced models such as the [[Polyphon]] and others all made use of interchangeable metal disks instead of cylinders. The cylinder-based machines rapidly became a minority.\n\n[[File:Baud museum mg 8498.jpg|thumb|Mechanical piano combined with strings. There are three violins each with only one string. Thus, only tunes that do not require the missing fourth string can be played.]]\n[[File:Baud museum mg 8461.jpg|thumb|[[Orchestrion]]]]\nThe term \"music box\" is also applied to clockwork devices where a removable metal disk or cylinder was used only in a \"programming\" function without producing the sounds directly by means of pins and a comb. Instead, the cylinder (or disk) worked by actuating bellows and levers which fed and opened pneumatic valves which activated a modified [[wind instrument]] or plucked the chords on a modified [[string instrument]]. Some devices could do both at the same time and were often combinations of player pianos and music boxes, such as the [[Orchestrion]].\n\nThere were many variations of large music machines, usually built for the affluent of the pre-phonograph 19th century.\n\nThe [https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/articles/2771 Symphonium] company started business in 1885 as the first manufacturers of disc-playing music boxes.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/articles/2771|title=Hose, K.

No other disc-playing musical box exists in so many varieties.  \u00a0 The company also pioneered the use of electric motors...the first model fitted with an electric motor being advertised in 1900. The company moved into the piano-orchestrion business and made both disc-operated and barrel-playing models, player-pianos and phonographs.\u201c\n\nMeanwhile,  Polyphon expanded to America. where Brachhausen established the [[Regina Company|Regina Company.]] Regina was a spectacular success (see Wikipedia article). It eventually reinvented itself as a maker of vacuums and steam cleaners. \n\nIn the heyday of the music box, some variations were as tall as a grandfather clock and all used interchangeable large disks to play different sets of tunes. These were spring-wound and driven and both had a bell-like sound. The machines were often made in England, Italy, and the US, with additional disks made in Switzerland, Austria, and Prussia. Early \"juke-box\" pay versions of them existed in public places. Marsh's free Museum and curio shop in [[Long Beach, Washington]] (US) has several still-working versions of them on public display. The [[Musical Museum, Brentford]], [[London]] has a number of machines://www.musicalmuseum.co.uk/page22.html |title=musicalmuseum.co.uk |access-date=2011-05-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426035303/http://musicalmuseum.co.uk/page22.html |archive-date=2011-04-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Morris Museum in Morristown, New Jersey, USA has a notable collection, including interactive exhibits. In addition to video and audio footage of each piece, the actual instruments are demonstrated for the public daily on a rotational basis.<ref>[http://morrismuseum.org/wordpress/mechanical-musical-instruments-automata/ morrismuseum.org]</ref> \n\nAt the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th, most music boxes were gradually replaced by [[player piano]]s, which were louder and more versatile and melodious, when kept tuned, and by the smaller [[phonograph|gramophone]]s which had the advantage of playing back voices. Regina produced combinations of these devices. Escalating labour costs increased the price and further reduced volume. Now modern automation is helping to bring music box prices back down.\n\nCollectors prize surviving music boxes from the 19th century and the early 20th century as well as new music boxes being made today in several countries (see \"Evolving Box Production\", below). Inexpensive, small windup music box movements (including the cylinder and comb and the spring) that  add a bit of music to mass-produced jewellery boxes and novelty items are now produced in countries with low labour costs.\n\nMany kinds of music box movements are available to the home craft person, locally or through online retailers.

In 1848, the manufacturing of the ''singing birds'' is improved by Blaise Bontems in his [[Paris]]ian workshop, to the point where it has remained unchanged to this day. Barrel organs become more popular.\n\n1796: [[Antoine Favre-Salomon]], a clockmaker from [[Geneva]] replaces the stack of bells by a comb with multiple pre-tuned metallic notes in order to reduce space. Together with a horizontally placed pinned barrel, this produces more varied and complex sounds. One of these first music boxes is now displayed at the [[Shanghai Gallery of Antique Music Boxes and Automata]] in [[Pudong]]'s [[Oriental Art Center]].<ref>[http://en.shoac.com.cn/Content.asp?nrID=141 en.shoac.com.cn], \"Antique Music Box Gallery\", accessed 18 Dec 2014.</ref> Numerous musical objects are produced in greater quantities in Geneva by several makers.\n\n1800: Isaac Daniel Piguet in Geneva produces repeating musical watches with a pinned horizontal disc operating radially arranged tuned steel teeth.\n\n1811: The first music boxes are produced in [[Sainte-Croix, Switzerland|Sainte-Croix]]; an industry which surpasses the watchmaking and lace industries, and rapidly brings renown to the town. At this time, the musical-box industry represents 10% of Switzerland's export.\n\n[[File:Baud museum mg 8521.jpg|thumb|Pocket watch with musical movements]]\n1865: Charles Reuge, a watchmaker from the [[Val-de-Travers]], settles in Sainte-Croix. He is one of many artisans making pocket watches with musical movements of the traditional calibre.\n\n1870: A German inventor creates a music box with discs, therefore allowing an easier and more frequent change of tunes. It is also the golden years of [[Automaton|automata]]. Already known in [[Egypt]], they will be improved to become real works of art.\n\n1877: [[Thomas Edison]] invents the [[phonograph]], which has important consequences for the musical-box industry, especially around the end of the century.\n\n1892: Gustave Brachhausen, who had been involved with the manufacturer of [[Polyphon]] disk music boxes in Germany, sails for America to establish the Regina Music Box Company in New Jersey. Regina, whose boxes are renowned among collectors for their tone, becomes a success and some 100,000 are sold before sales cease in 1921.\n\nEarly 20th century: The invention of the phonograph, the [[First World War]] and the economic crisis in the '20s bring down Sainte-Croix's main industry and make the luxury music box completely disappear.\n\n[[File:Caja musica.jpg|thumb|Music box with dancing ballerina]]\nBetween the two world wars most of the Swiss companies converted to the manufacture of other products requiring precise mechanical parts. Some went back to making watches, others were eventually responsible for the famous [[Bolex]] [[movie camera]]s and the Hermes [[typewriter]]s. Some simply sold out to Reuge.\n\nLocated near [[Lake Neuch\u00e2tel]], Reuge is one of the last of the Swiss survivors making music boxes of all sizes and shapes, with or without [[automaton]]s in a modern style with clear acrylic sides to see the mechanical operation. They have in a sense branched out widely from their original cylinder offerings since they also offered traditional-looking music boxes with removable metal disks for around 1,000 euros, with each disk costing in the neighborhood of 14 euros. The higher range boxes with removable cylinders and small assorted tables made of fine woods can cost up to 34,000 euros and about an equivalent number of US dollars. They also sell several models of clear acrylic paperweights with a music box movement inside, for a minimum of about 250 euros. They have, however, discontinued the smaller movements. Old Reuge music boxes are worth thousands of dollars but even so, cannot be compared to the fabulously large and highly complex music boxes which were produced in nineteenth-century Switzerland by legendary makers such as Nicole Fr\u00e8res or Paillard. Since approximatively 2007 Reuge developed a strong business in the world of \"bespoke\" customized pieces for leaders in business and politics.\n\n[http://www.nidec-sankyo.co.jp/english/index.html Nidec Sankyo] in Japan started up in the aftermath of World War II, using the latest in automation. Modern production methods resulted in reasonable prices, producing company growth. Sankyo started with small movements, introduced 50-note movements by the late 1970s, and in 2006 is producing disc boxes playing discs as large as 16\" (with two 80-note combs and reminiscent of the \"Mira\") and are also working on a dual-cylinder 100-note movement. Sankyo now offers a wide variety of music boxes in Japan, and supplies movements to many other manufacturers and distributors. Some of these sell them retail (even online) to hobbyists for as low as 3 euros each. Sankyo Seiki bills itself as the biggest manufacturer of music boxes in the world and advertises that it controls 50% of the market. Recently, it has started selling licences for its musical-box tunes to [[cellular phone]] companies, for use as ring tones. The company is an industrial concern which also makes magnetic and hologram card readers, appliance components, industrial robots and miniature motors of all kinds.\n\nThe Porter Music Box company of [[Vermont]] produces steel disc music boxes in several formats. They offer clockwork, spring-wound models as well as electric ones. They stand out by their continuing production of discs, with a selection of about a thousand tunes. The discs can also be played on many antique music boxes bearing the Polyphon and Regina brand names.\n\nThe small 18-note musical movements are now being made almost exclusively in countries with low labour costs such as [[China]] and [[Taiwan]]. Many of these productions are used in mobiles, children's musical toys, and jewellery boxes.\n\nIn March 2016, the band Wintergatan released a video of their homemade [[Wintergatan#Marble Machine|Marble Machine]] which took 14 months to make and played in any key using a 3,000-piece wooden construction fueled by 2,000 marbles.

Some of the models had a mechanism for automatically changing the metal disks. These were, in a sense, the precursors to [[jukebox]]. However, they soon disappeared from their intended venues and were displaced by the jukebox, which could produce a greater variety of sounds and full songs rather than warped fragments.\n\nBecause most of the coin-operated music boxes were built for rough treatment (such as slapping and kicking by a customer), many of these large models have survived into the 21st century, despite their relatively low production quantities. They are sought by collectors who have the space for their large or very large cabinets.\n\n==Parts==\n[[File:Music box elements.jpg|thumb|The ratchet lever [1] rotates the cylinder [2], the pins pluck the comb teeth [3] which produces the music.

The tines of the comb 'ring', or sound, as they slip off the pins. The disc in a disc music box plays this function, with pins perpendicular to the plane surface.\n*Multiple-tune cylinders have more than one set of pins intertwined on the same cylinder, with, for example, the B pins for a second song lying halfway between the B and C pins of the first song, etc. Offsetting the cylinder slightly relative to the comb brings the different set of pins into contact with the teeth, thereby playing an alternate piece of music. Many modern music boxes will have as many as four sets of pins intertwined, with a mechanism automatically shifting the cylinder from one song or movement to the next.\n\n==Repertoire==\nIn 1974\u201375, German composer [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] composed ''[[Tierkreis (Stockhausen)|Tierkreis]]'', a set of twelve pieces on the signs of the [[zodiac]], for twelve music boxes.<ref>Peter Andraschke, \"Kompositorische Tendenzen bei Karlheinz Stockhausen seit 1965\", in ''Zur Neuen Einfachheit in der Musik'', Studien zur Wertungsforschung 14, edited by Otto Kolleritsch, 126\u201343 (Vienna and Graz: Universal Edition [for the Institut f\u00fcr Wertungsforschung an der Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik und darstellende Kunst in Graz], 1981). {{ISBN|3-7024-0153-9}}.</ref><ref>Giuliano d'Angiolini, \"''Tierkreis'', oeuvre pour instrument m\u00e9lodique et/ou harmonique: un tournant dans le parcours musical de Stockhausen\", ''Analyse Musicale'' (1989, 1er trimestre): 68\u201373.</ref><ref>Hermann Conen, ''Formel-Komposition: Zu Karlheinz Stockhausens Musik der siebziger Jahre'', K\u00f6lner Schriften zur Neuen Musik 1, edited by [[Johannes Fritsch]] and [[Dietrich K\u00e4mper]].

The earliest known mechanical musical instruments date back to 9th-century Baghdad. In [[Flanders]], in the early 13th century, a bell ringer invented a cylinder with pins which operate cams, which then hit the bells. (See below.) The popular device best known to us today as a \u201cmusic box\u201d developed from musical [[Decorative boxes#Snuff box|snuff box]]es of the 18th century and were originally called ''carillons \u00e0 musique'' (French for \"chimes of music\"). Some of the more complex boxes also contain a tiny [[drum]] and/or [[bell]]s in addition to the metal comb.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Baud museum mg 8543.jpg|thumb|Typical table music box, with six interchangeable cylinders]]\nThe original snuff boxes were tiny containers which could fit into a gentleman's waistcoat pocket. The music boxes could have any size from that of a hat box to a large piece of furniture, but most were tabletop specimens. They were usually powered by [[clockwork]] and originally produced by artisan [[watchmaker]]s. For most of the 19th century, the bulk of music box production was concentrated in Switzerland, building upon a strong watchmaking tradition. The first music box factory was opened there in 1815 by J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Recordon and Samuel Junod. There were also a few manufacturers in Bohemia and Germany. By the end of the 19th century, some of the European makers had opened factories in the United States.\n\nThe cylinders were normally made of metal and powered by a spring. In some of the costlier models, the cylinders could be removed to change melodies, thanks to an invention by Paillard in 1862, which was perfected by Metert of Geneva in 1879.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} In some exceptional models, there were four springs, to provide continuous play for up to three hours.\n\n[[File:CIMA mg 8302.jpg|thumb|Music box using the metal disk system]]\nThe very first boxes at the end of the 18th century made use of metal disks. The switchover to cylinders seems to have been completed after the Napoleonic wars. In the last decades of the 19th century, however, mass-produced models such as the [[Polyphon]] and others all made use of interchangeable metal disks instead of cylinders. The cylinder-based machines rapidly became a minority.\n\n[[File:Baud museum mg 8498.jpg|thumb|Mechanical piano combined with strings. There are three violins each with only one string. Thus, only tunes that do not require the missing fourth string can be played.]]\n[[File:Baud museum mg 8461.jpg|thumb|[[Orchestrion]]]]\nThe term \"music box\" is also applied to clockwork devices where a removable metal disk or cylinder was used only in a \"programming\" function without producing the sounds directly by means of pins and a comb. Instead, the cylinder (or disk) worked by actuating bellows and levers which fed and opened pneumatic valves which activated a modified [[wind instrument]] or plucked the chords on a modified [[string instrument]]. Some devices could do both at the same time and were often combinations of player pianos and music boxes, such as the [[Orchestrion]].\n\nThere were many variations of large music machines, usually built for the affluent of the pre-phonograph 19th century.\n\nThe [https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/articles/2771 Symphonium] company started business in 1885 as the first manufacturers of disc-playing music boxes.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/articles/2771|title=Hose, K. (2009) A Brief History of the Symphonion Company in Museums Victoria Collections|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Two of the founders of the company, Gustave Brachhausen and Paul Riessner, left to set up a new firm, [[Polyphon]], in direct competition with their original business and their third partner, Oscar Paul Lochmann. <ref name=\":0\" />  Following the establishment of the Original Musikwerke Paul Lochmann in 1900, the founding Symphonion business continued until 1909. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAccording to the Victoria Museums in Australia, \u201cThe Symphonion is notable for the enormous diversity of types, styles and models produced... No other disc-playing musical box exists in so many varieties.  \u00a0 The company also pioneered the use of electric motors...the first model fitted with an electric motor being advertised in 1900. The company moved into the piano-orchestrion business and made both disc-operated and barrel-playing models, player-pianos and phonographs.\u201c\n\nMeanwhile,  Polyphon expanded to America. where Brachhausen established the [[Regina Company|Regina Company.]] Regina was a spectacular success (see Wikipedia article). It eventually reinvented itself as a maker of vacuums and steam cleaners. \n\nIn the heyday of the music box, some variations were as tall as a grandfather clock and all used interchangeable large disks to play different sets of tunes. These were spring-wound and driven and both had a bell-like sound. The machines were often made in England, Italy, and the US, with additional disks made in Switzerland, Austria, and Prussia. Early \"juke-box\" pay versions of them existed in public places. Marsh's free Museum and curio shop in [[Long Beach, Washington]] (US) has several still-working versions of them on public display. The [[Musical Museum, Brentford]], [[London]] has a number of machines.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.musicalmuseum.co.uk/page22.html |title=musicalmuseum.co.uk |access-date=2011-05-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426035303/http://musicalmuseum.co.uk/page22.html |archive-date=2011-04-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Morris Museum in Morristown, New Jersey, USA has a notable collection, including interactive exhibits.

Regina produced combinations of these devices. Escalating labour costs increased the price and further reduced volume. Now modern automation is helping to bring music box prices back down.\n\nCollectors prize surviving music boxes from the 19th century and the early 20th century as well as new music boxes being made today in several countries (see \"Evolving Box Production\", below). Inexpensive, small windup music box movements (including the cylinder and comb and the spring) that  add a bit of music to mass-produced jewellery boxes and novelty items are now produced in countries with low labour costs.\n\nMany kinds of music box movements are available to the home craft person, locally or through online retailers. A wide range of recordings and videos of historic music boxes is available on the web.\n\n===Timeline===\n{{prose|date=August 2012}}\n9th century: In Baghdad, Iraq, the [[Ban\u016b M\u016bs\u0101]] brothers, a trio of [[Inventions in the Islamic world|Persian inventors]], produced \"the earliest known mechanical musical instrument\", in this case a [[hydropower]]ed [[Organ (music)|organ]] which played interchangeable cylinders automatically, which they described in their ''[[Book of Ingenious Devices]]''.

In 1848, the manufacturing of the ''singing birds'' is improved by Blaise Bontems in his [[Paris]]ian workshop, to the point where it has remained unchanged to this day. Barrel organs become more popular.\n\n1796: [[Antoine Favre-Salomon]], a clockmaker from [[Geneva]] replaces the stack of bells by a comb with multiple pre-tuned metallic notes in order to reduce space. Together with a horizontally placed pinned barrel, this produces more varied and complex sounds. One of these first music boxes is now displayed at the [[Shanghai Gallery of Antique Music Boxes and Automata]] in [[Pudong]]'s [[Oriental Art Center]].<ref>[http://en.shoac.com.cn/Content.asp?nrID=141 en.shoac.com.cn], \"Antique Music Box Gallery\", accessed 18 Dec 2014.</ref> Numerous musical objects are produced in greater quantities in Geneva by several makers.\n\n1800: Isaac Daniel Piguet in Geneva produces repeating musical watches with a pinned horizontal disc operating radially arranged tuned steel teeth.\n\n1811: The first music boxes are produced in [[Sainte-Croix, Switzerland|Sainte-Croix]]; an industry which surpasses the watchmaking and lace industries, and rapidly brings renown to the town. At this time, the musical-box industry represents 10% of Switzerland's export.\n\n[[File:Baud museum mg 8521.jpg|thumb|Pocket watch with musical movements]]\n1865: Charles Reuge, a watchmaker from the [[Val-de-Travers]], settles in Sainte-Croix. He is one of many artisans making pocket watches with musical movements of the traditional calibre.\n\n1870: A German inventor creates a music box with discs, therefore allowing an easier and more frequent change of tunes. It is also the golden years of [[Automaton|automata]]. Already known in [[Egypt]], they will be improved to become real works of art.\n\n1877: [[Thomas Edison]] invents the [[phonograph]], which has important consequences for the musical-box industry, especially around the end of the century.\n\n1892: Gustave Brachhausen, who had been involved with the manufacturer of [[Polyphon]] disk music boxes in Germany, sails for America to establish the Regina Music Box Company in New Jersey. Regina, whose boxes are renowned among collectors for their tone, becomes a success and some 100,000 are sold before sales cease in 1921.\n\nEarly 20th century: The invention of the phonograph, the [[First World War]] and the economic crisis in the '20s bring down Sainte-Croix's main industry and make the luxury music box completely disappear.\n\n[[File:Caja musica.jpg|thumb|Music box with dancing ballerina]]\nBetween the two world wars most of the Swiss companies converted to the manufacture of other products requiring precise mechanical parts. Some went back to making watches, others were eventually responsible for the famous [[Bolex]] [[movie camera]]s and the Hermes [[typewriter]]s. Some simply sold out to Reuge.\n\nLocated near [[Lake Neuch\u00e2tel]], Reuge is one of the last of the Swiss survivors making music boxes of all sizes and shapes, with or without [[automaton]]s in a modern style with clear acrylic sides to see the mechanical operation. They have in a sense branched out widely from their original cylinder offerings since they also offered traditional-looking music boxes with removable metal disks for around 1,000 euros, with each disk costing in the neighborhood of 14 euros. The higher range boxes with removable cylinders and small assorted tables made of fine woods can cost up to 34,000 euros and about an equivalent number of US dollars. They also sell several models of clear acrylic paperweights with a music box movement inside, for a minimum of about 250 euros. They have, however, discontinued the smaller movements. Old Reuge music boxes are worth thousands of dollars but even so, cannot be compared to the fabulously large and highly complex music boxes which were produced in nineteenth-century Switzerland by legendary makers such as Nicole Fr\u00e8res or Paillard. Since approximatively 2007 Reuge developed a strong business in the world of \"bespoke\" customized pieces for leaders in business and politics.\n\n[http://www.nidec-sankyo.co.jp/english/index.html Nidec Sankyo] in Japan started up in the aftermath of World War II, using the latest in automation. Modern production methods resulted in reasonable prices, producing company growth. Sankyo started with small movements, introduced 50-note movements by the late 1970s, and in 2006 is producing disc boxes playing discs as large as 16\" (with two 80-note combs and reminiscent of the \"Mira\") and are also working on a dual-cylinder 100-note movement. Sankyo now offers a wide variety of music boxes in Japan, and supplies movements to many other manufacturers and distributors. Some of these sell them retail (even online) to hobbyists for as low as 3 euros each. Sankyo Seiki bills itself as the biggest manufacturer of music boxes in the world and advertises that it controls 50% of the market. Recently, it has started selling licences for its musical-box tunes to [[cellular phone]] companies, for use as ring tones. The company is an industrial concern which also makes magnetic and hologram card readers, appliance components, industrial robots and miniature motors of all kinds.\n\nThe Porter Music Box company of [[Vermont]] produces steel disc music boxes in several formats. They offer clockwork, spring-wound models as well as electric ones. They stand out by their continuing production of discs, with a selection of about a thousand tunes. The discs can also be played on many antique music boxes bearing the Polyphon and Regina brand names.\n\nThe small 18-note musical movements are now being made almost exclusively in countries with low labour costs such as [[China]] and [[Taiwan]]. Many of these productions are used in mobiles, children's musical toys, and jewellery boxes.\n\nIn March 2016, the band Wintergatan released a video of their homemade [[Wintergatan#Marble Machine|Marble Machine]] which took 14 months to make and played in any key using a 3,000-piece wooden construction fueled by 2,000 marbles.

The tines of the comb 'ring', or sound, as they slip off the pins. The disc in a disc music box plays this function, with pins perpendicular to the plane surface.\n*Multiple-tune cylinders have more than one set of pins intertwined on the same cylinder, with, for example, the B pins for a second song lying halfway between the B and C pins of the first song, etc. Offsetting the cylinder slightly relative to the comb brings the different set of pins into contact with the teeth, thereby playing an alternate piece of music. Many modern music boxes will have as many as four sets of pins intertwined, with a mechanism automatically shifting the cylinder from one song or movement to the next.\n\n==Repertoire==\nIn 1974\u201375, German composer [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] composed ''[[Tierkreis (Stockhausen)|Tierkreis]]'', a set of twelve pieces on the signs of the [[zodiac]], for twelve music boxes.<ref>Peter Andraschke, \"Kompositorische Tendenzen bei Karlheinz Stockhausen seit 1965\", in ''Zur Neuen Einfachheit in der Musik'', Studien zur Wertungsforschung 14, edited by Otto Kolleritsch, 126\u201343 (Vienna and Graz: Universal Edition [for the Institut f\u00fcr Wertungsforschung an der Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik und darstellende Kunst in Graz], 1981). {{ISBN|3-7024-0153-9}}.</ref><ref>Giuliano d'Angiolini, \"''Tierkreis'', oeuvre pour instrument m\u00e9lodique et/ou harmonique: un tournant dans le parcours musical de Stockhausen\", ''Analyse Musicale'' (1989, 1er trimestre): 68\u201373.</ref><ref>Hermann Conen, ''Formel-Komposition: Zu Karlheinz Stockhausens Musik der siebziger Jahre'', K\u00f6lner Schriften zur Neuen Musik 1, edited by [[Johannes Fritsch]] and [[Dietrich K\u00e4mper]].
