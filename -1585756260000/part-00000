A large clinical problem was women with chronic pelvic pain. Together with another physiotherapist, Tove Boe, she developed a new group treatment for women with chronic pelvic pain with focus on a psychosomatic approach. Combining qualitative actions research methods with quantitative measurements of improvements, the results showed that the patients improved significantly. This research was published in her Master's thesis and a scientific paper.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Albert | first1 = H | year = 1999 | title = Psychosomatic group treatment helps women with chronic pelvic pain | url = | journal = J Psychosom Obstret Gynecol | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 216\u201325 }}</ref>\n\nThe large number of pregnant women with pelvic girdle pain, was a challenge at the obstetric department. Little was known about the diagnosis and treatment of this painful condition in pregnant and post-partum women. Together with another physiotherapists Mona Godskesen, she undertook the challenge of attempting to classify the different groups of Pelvic Girdle pain into subgroups which required different treatment. The study (still the largest in the world) included 2269 pregnant women. All of them were examined in their 20. week of pregnancy. The women who suffered from pelvic pain were followed at 1, 3,6,12, 24 months after delivery, or until their pelvic pain subsided. The main findings of the study were, that there are most likely four different subgroups of pelvic girdle pain.  Then different groups have different incidence, and there is different clinical characteristics and pain pattern and different prognosis. Most important is the subgroups; Pelvic Girdle Syndrome, 5% of the pregnant women suffer from Pelvic Girdle Syndrome. Unfortunately, these women have a poor prognosis, hence 20% of the women still suffer from pain 2 years after delivery of the child. \nThis research resulted in five scientific papers and three summaries.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Albert | first1 = H | last2 = Godskesen | first2 = M | last3 = Westergaard | first3 = JG | last4 = Chard | first4 = T | last5 = Gunn | first5 = L | year = 1997 | title = Circulating levels of relaxin are normal in pregnant women with pelvic pain | url = | journal = Eur J obstet Gynecol Reproductive biology | volume = 74 | issue = | pages = 19\u201322 | doi = 10.1016/s0301-2115(97)00076-6 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Albert | first1 = H | last2 = Godskesen | first2 = M | last3 = Westergaard | first3 = JG | year = 2000 | title = Evaluation of clinical tests used in classification procedures in pregnancy-related pelvic joint pain | url = | journal = Eur Spine J | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 161\u20136 | doi = 10.1007/s005860050228 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Albert | first1 = HB | last2 = Godskesen | first2 = M | last3 = Westergaard | first3 = JG | year = 2001 | title = Prognosis of four classification groups of pregnancy-related pelvic joint pain | url = | journal = Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand | volume = 80 | issue = | pages = 505\u201310 | doi = 10.1034/j.1600-0412.2001.080006505.x }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Albert | first1 = HB | last2 = Godskesen | first2 = M | last3 = Westergaard | first3 = JG | year = 2002 | title = Incidence of four syndromes of pregnancy-related pelvic joint pain | url = | journal = Spine | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 2831\u20134 | doi = 10.1097/00007632-200212150-00020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Albert | first1 = HB | last2 = Godskesen | first2 = M | last3 = Korsholm | first3 = L | last4 = Westergaard | first4 = JG | year = 2006 | title = Risk Factors in developing Pregnancy-Related Pelvic Girdle Pain | url = | journal = Acta Obstetrica et Gynecologica | volume = 85 | issue = | pages = 539\u201344 | doi = 10.1080/00016340600578415 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Albert | first1 = HB | year = 2002 | title = Behandling af b\u00e6kken- og l\u00e6nderygsmerter hos gravide og post partum kvinder | url = | journal = Muskuloskelatalt forum | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 16\u201321 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Albert | first1 = HB | year = 2012 | title = B\u00e6kkensmerter i graviditeten - forekomst, prognose, risikofaktorer og diagnostisering | url = | journal = Best Practice | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 23\u201325 }}</ref> For this scientific work she was awarded two awards, and a seat in the European Guideline Group.\n\n===Disc herniation===\nIn 2000 Dr. Hanne Albert was employed as a researcher and a Ph.D. student at The Back Centre in Ringe. The aim of her Ph.D. was, to evaluate the possibility of treating to treat patients with severe lumbar disc herniation with exercises. These were patients who would normally be considered surgical candidates. In 2000, this had not previously been shown. The study showed, that there was highly significant improvement in patients of this kind of treatment. It was also possible to specify the patient's prognoses by dividing the patients into different response to Specific exercises and positioning (McKenzie), different personally traits, and different types of herniation and these subgroups required different treatment.<ref>Albert HB.

About 50% of the patients developed Modic Changes/bone edema in the vertebrae adjacent to the previously herniated, this was visible one year after their disc herniation. These patients also developed back pain, whereas the main problem that they presented while having the lumbar disc herniation was pain radiating into one or both legs.

A large clinical problem was women with chronic pelvic pain. Together with another physiotherapist, Tove Boe, she developed a new group treatment for women with chronic pelvic pain with focus on a psychosomatic approach. Combining qualitative actions research methods with quantitative measurements of improvements, the results showed that the patients improved significantly. This research was published in her Master's thesis and a scientific paper.<ref>'''Albert H.''' Psychosomatic group treatment helps women with chronic pelvic pain. J Psychosom Obstret Gynecol 1999;20:216-25</ref>\n\nThe large number of pregnant women with pelvic girdle pain, was a challenge at the obstetric department. Little was known about the diagnosis and treatment of this painful condition in pregnant and post-partum women. Together with another physiotherapists Mona Godskesen, she undertook the challenge of attempting to classify the different groups of Pelvic Girdle pain into subgroups which required different treatment. The study (still the largest in the world) included 2269 pregnant women. All of them were examined in their 20. week of pregnancy. The women who suffered from pelvic pain were followed at 1, 3,6,12, 24 months after delivery, or until their pelvic pain subsided. The main findings of the study were, that there are most likely four different subgroups of pelvic girdle pain.  Then different groups have different incidence, and there is different clinical characteristics and pain pattern and different prognosis. Most important is the subgroups; Pelvic Girdle Syndrome, 5% of the pregnant women suffer from Pelvic Girdle Syndrome. Unfortunately, these women have a poor prognosis, hence 20% of the women still suffer from pain 2 years after delivery of the child. \nThis research resulted in five scientific papers and three summaries.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Albert | first1 = H | last2 = Godskesen | first2 = M | last3 = Westergaard | first3 = JG | last4 = Chard | first4 = T | last5 = Gunn | first5 = L | year = 1997 | title = Circulating levels of relaxin are normal in pregnant women with pelvic pain | url = | journal = Eur J obstet Gynecol Reproductive biology | volume = 74 | issue = | pages = 19\u201322 | doi = 10.1016/s0301-2115(97)00076-6 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Albert | first1 = H | last2 = Godskesen | first2 = M | last3 = Westergaard | first3 = JG | year = 2000 | title = Evaluation of clinical tests used in classification procedures in pregnancy-related pelvic joint pain | url = | journal = Eur Spine J | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 161\u20136 | doi = 10.1007/s005860050228 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Albert | first1 = HB | last2 = Godskesen | first2 = M | last3 = Westergaard | first3 = JG | year = 2001 | title = Prognosis of four classification groups of pregnancy-related pelvic joint pain | url = | journal = Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand | volume = 80 | issue = | pages = 505\u201310 | doi = 10.1034/j.1600-0412.2001.080006505.x }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Albert | first1 = HB | last2 = Godskesen | first2 = M | last3 = Westergaard | first3 = JG | year = 2002 | title = Incidence of four syndromes of pregnancy-related pelvic joint pain | url = | journal = Spine | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 2831\u20134 | doi = 10.1097/00007632-200212150-00020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Albert | first1 = HB | last2 = Godskesen | first2 = M | last3 = Korsholm | first3 = L | last4 = Westergaard | first4 = JG | year = 2006 | title = Risk Factors in developing Pregnancy-Related Pelvic Girdle Pain | url = | journal = Acta Obstetrica et Gynecologica | volume = 85 | issue = | pages = 539\u201344 | doi = 10.1080/00016340600578415 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Albert | first1 = HB | year = 2002 | title = Behandling af b\u00e6kken- og l\u00e6nderygsmerter hos gravide og post partum kvinder | url = | journal = Muskuloskelatalt forum | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 16\u201321 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Albert | first1 = HB | year = 2012 | title = B\u00e6kkensmerter i graviditeten - forekomst, prognose, risikofaktorer og diagnostisering | url = | journal = Best Practice | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 23\u201325 }}</ref> For this scientific work she was awarded two awards, and a seat in the European Guideline Group.\n\n===Disc herniation===\nIn 2000 Dr. Hanne Albert was employed as a researcher and a Ph.D. student at The Back Centre in Ringe. The aim of her Ph.D. was, to evaluate the possibility of treating to treat patients with severe lumbar disc herniation with exercises. These were patients who would normally be considered surgical candidates. In 2000, this had not previously been shown. The study showed, that there was highly significant improvement in patients of this kind of treatment. It was also possible to specify the patient's prognoses by dividing the patients into different response to Specific exercises and positioning (McKenzie), different personally traits, and different types of herniation and these subgroups required different treatment.<ref>Albert HB.

About 50% of the patients developed Modic Changes/bone edema in the vertebrae adjacent to the previously herniated, this was visible one year after their disc herniation. These patients also developed back pain, whereas the main problem that they presented while having the lumbar disc herniation was pain radiating into one or both legs.

Some major changes have taken place in history and have affected the number of titles that have been won by various players. These have included the opening of the French national championships to international players in 1925, the elimination of the challenge round in 1922, and the admission of professional players in 1968 (the start of the [[History of tennis#Open era|Open era]]).<ref>ESPN Sports Almanac 2006, page 814</ref><ref>World Book Encyclopedia 2008 T p166a</ref><ref>Compton Encyclopedia 1975 ST p301</ref><ref>Concord Encyclopedia</ref><ref>CBS Sports \"[http://www.cbssports.com/tennis/history/slams/women]\"</ref><ref>Top End Sports \"[http://www.topendsports.com/events/tennis-grand-slam/]\"</ref><ref>USA Today Tennis \"[https://www.usatoday.com/sports/tennis/00wim/sampras2.htm]\"</ref><ref>Tennis 28 Slams \"[http://www.tennis28.com/slams/wins_alltime.html]\"</ref>\n\nNote:  All of these tournaments have been listed since they began, rather than when they officially became majors. The Australian and US tournaments have only been officially regarded as majors by the ILTF (now the ITF) since 1924 (though many regarded the US Championships as a major before then). The French Championships have only been a major since 1925 (when it became open to all amateurs internationally).\nBefore 1924 (since 1912/1913 to 1923) there were 3 official majors: Wimbledon, the [[World Hard Court Championships]] (played on [[clay court|clay]]) and the [[World Covered Court Championships]] (played on an indoor wood surface).\n[[Image:Roger Federer (26 June 2009, Wimbledon) 3 cropped.jpg|thumb|right|<center>[[Roger Federer]] has won [[Grand Slam (tennis)|20 Major singles titles]] \u2014 the most by any man in history, including an all-time record eight [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] titles.</center>]]\n[[Image:Rodney George Laver.jpg|thumb|right|<center>[[Rod Laver]] is the only man in history to win all four Majors in the same calendar year \"The Grand Slam\" twice (1962 and 1969)</center>]]\n[[Image:Don Budge.jpg|thumb|right|<center>[[Don Budge]] is the only male player in tennis history to have won six consecutive Grand Slam singles titles, from [[1937 Wimbledon Championships - Men's Singles|Wimbledon 1937]] to [[1938 U.S. National Championships \u2013 Men's Singles|U.S. Championships 1938]].</center>]]\n[[File:Paris-FR-75-open de tennis-2-6--17-Roland Garros-Rafael Nadal-21.jpg|thumb|<center>[[Rafael Nadal]] has won 19 Major titles, including 12 [[French Open]] titles at [[Stade Roland Garros|Roland Garros]], making him the only male player with double digit titles at one particular Grand Slam event.</center>]]\n[[File:Novak Djokovic French Open 2015.jpg|thumb|<center>[[Novak Djokovic]] is the only player to hold all four major titles on three different surfaces simultaneously.

He was the first great French rider of the post-war period and the first rider to win the [[Tour de France]] in three successive years, from 1953 to 1955. His career included the national road championship (1950 and 1951), [[Milan\u2013San Remo]] (1951), [[Giro di Lombardia]] (1951), [[Crit\u00e9rium International]] (1951 & 52), [[Paris\u2013Nice]] (1952), [[Grand Prix des Nations]] (1952), [[UCI World Championships|world road championship]] (1954), [[Tour of Flanders]] (1955), [[Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9|Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9]] (1955), [[Tour de Luxembourg]] (1955), [[Paris\u2013Roubaix]] (1956) and [[Bordeaux\u2013Paris]] (1959).\n\n==Origins==\nLouis Bobet was born one of three children above his father's baker's shop in the rue de Montfort,<ref>It is no longer a bakery. The Bobet family left and most recently it is a driving school, the road having been renamed rue Louison Bobet. A plaque on the wall marks it as Bobet's birthplace.</ref> Saint-M\u00e9en-le-Grand, near [[Rennes]]. His father gave him a bicycle when he was two and after six months he could ride it 6&nbsp;km.<ref name=\"Ont'Wheel\">On the Wheel, USA, undated cutting</ref> Bobet's father was also called Louis and the son was called Louison - little Louis - to avoid confusion The ending ''-on'' is a diminutive in French but outside Brittany Louison refers more usually to a girl. He was known as Louis in his early years as a rider, even as a professional, until the diminutive Louison gained in popularity.<ref name=\"Ont'Wheel\"/>\n\nHis sister played [[table tennis]], his brother [[Jean Bobet|Jean]] [[Association football|football]], although he also became a professional cyclist. Louison played both table tennis<ref name=\"The Bicycle, UK, 4 July 1951, p24\">The Bicycle, UK, 4 July 1951, p24</ref> and football and became Brittany champion at table tennis.<ref name=\"Ont'Wheel\"/> It was his uncle, Raymond, who was president of a cycling club in Paris who persuaded him to concentrate on cycling.<ref name=\"Ont'Wheel\"/>\n\nBobet's first race was a 30&nbsp;km event when he was 13. He came second in a sprint finish.<ref name=\"The Bicycle, UK, 4 July 1951, p24\"/> He raced in his local area and won four events for unlicensed riders<ref>Unlicensed riders did not have a licence from the national cycling organisation</ref> in 1941. He qualified for the final of the unofficial youth championship, the Premier Pas [[Dunlop Rubber|Dunlop]] in 1943 at [[Montlu\u00e7on]] and came sixth. The winner was [[Rapha\u00ebl G\u00e9miniani]], who would become a professional team-mate and rival.\n\nBobet is said to have carried messages for the [[French Resistance|Resistance]] during the [[second world war]]. After [[D-Day]] he joined the army and served in eastern France. He was demobilised in December 1945.<ref name=\"Ont'Wheel\"/>\n\n==Racing career==\n\nBobet applied for racing licence on leaving the army and by error was sent one for an independent, or semi-professional. He benefited from the right to compete against professionals as well as amateurs. He came second in the Brittany championship and rode the national championship in Paris. There he came up against a veteran professional, [[Marcel Bidot]], who on retirement became Bobet's manager in the national team. Bobet left the field to catch two riders who had broken clear. He dropped one and outsprinted the other to become national champion. He turned fully professional for Stella, a bicycle factory in [[Nantes]].<ref name=\"Ont'Wheel\"/>\n\n===Tour de France 1947===\n\nStella was a small team that rode mainly in Brittany. In May 1947, however, two from the team rode the Boucles de la [[Seine]] race in Paris. He won alone by six minutes. It brought him an invitation to ride the Tour de France, at that time disputed by national and regional teams. The unexpected toughness of the race forced him to go home on the ninth day, in the [[Alps]] and to cry when the going got hard. It brought him the nickname \"cry-baby\" in the bunch<ref name=\"Ont'Wheel\"/> and [[Ren\u00e9 Vietto]] referred to him as ''La Bobette'', a mock feminisation of his name, for his tears and complaining. The historian Dick Yates wrote:\n\n:He brought down the scorn of the press and everyone quickly wrote off this 'cry-baby'. [[Ren\u00e9 Vietto]] was in the yellow jersey as leader of the [[General classification in the Tour de France|general classification]] and he looked like he was going to win - he was a real man. As France forgot about him, Bobet went home to lick his wounds and listen to words of advice from his father.<ref name=\"Ont'Wheel\"/>\n\n===Tour de France 1948===\nThe former rider, [[Maurice Archambaud]], took over management of the team from L\u00e9o V\u00e9ron and took a chance on Bobet. Much had changed since the previous summer and he took the lead after the third stage, which finished near Stella's factory in Nantes. Bobet lost the yellow jersey the following day but regained it by winning the sixth stage, to [[Biarritz]]. He had 20 minutes' lead over the veteran Italian, [[Gino Bartali]] as the race entered the Alps. And then happened one of the most outstanding periods in the history of the Tour.\n\n(''See [[Gino Bartali]] for full story.'')\n\nA political crisis in Italy threatened to overthrow the government and bring the country to anarchy. The prime minister asked Bartali to distract Italians by dominating the Tour.<ref name=\"McGann 158\">McGann, Bill and Carol (2006), The Story of the Tour de France, Dog Ear, US, p158</ref> Bartali won three stages in a row and the Tour by 14 minutes. Bobet's 20 minutes on Bartali was cut to a 32-minute deficit by the time the race finished in Paris. Bobet had twice worn the yellow jersey and won two stages, however, and with the money he won he moved to Paris and bought a [[drapery]] shop for his wife.\n\n===Tour de France 1950===\nBobet did not finish in 1949, struggling from the start. He dropped out on the first day in the mountains, along with four other members of the national team. In 1950 he won the national championship at [[Montlh\u00e9ry]] south of Paris the week before the Tour and rode in the national team with G\u00e9miniani, the rider who had beaten him as a boy in the Premier Pas Dunlop. He and Bobet developed a rocky friendship, G\u00e9miniani's rough, instinctive character a contrast to the more thoughtful, quieter Bobet. The two argued frequently but remained friends. G\u00e9miniani, following the French habit of creating [[nicknames]] by doubling a syllable of a name<ref>Raymond Poulidor, named Poupou by the journalist \u00c9mile Besson, is the most prominent example</ref> referred to Bobet as ''Zonzon'',<ref name=\"Ont'Wheel\"/><ref>Chany, Pierre (1988), La Fabuleuse Histoire du Tour de France, Nathan, France</ref> a name that Bobet hated but tolerated. G\u00e9miniani had the confidence that Bobet lacked.<ref name=\"Ont'Wheel\"/>\n\nBobet and G\u00e9miniani were second and third early in the race. Both hoped to profit from the absence of [[Fausto Coppi]], who was injured, but found themselves instead up against an unbeatable [[Ferdinand K\u00fcbler]]. Bobet finished third, winning the mountain competition.\n\n===Tour de France 1953===\n{{Quote box\n| quote  = Bobet is a good climber and time-triallist who rides with authority and intelligence. He is careful with his preparation, careful with his efforts and totally serious. An outstanding rider but has a lack of confidence [''morale'']. He is extremely nervous, sensitive, worried and susceptible. But with experience he will overcome the problems. A charming friend, happy, often joking and with spirit, but some days he shuts himself off, wrapped in his worries.\n| source = Jean Bidot, team manager<ref name=\"Ont'Wheel\"/> \n| width  = 25%\n | align  =right\n}} \nBobet rode the 1951 Tour in the blue-white-red of national champion again but cracked in the mountains. Jean Bidot, the manager, sent riders to help him but in the end abandoned him to concentrate on G\u00e9miniani, the best placed. Bobet came 20th, although with a stage win. He lost 40 minutes on the last day in the mountains even though the race was taking it easy, [[Hugo Koblet]] already being unbeatable. Dick Yates said:\n\n<blockquote>It was a terrible performance for a man of his class, but although he had suffered and suffered he had not given up the struggle. While this showed character, nobody was prepared to make allowances for it. 'He is just not a stage rider,' they said. 'He'll never win the Tour. No matter how brilliant you may be, if you're not consistent you haven't got a chance.' The sensitive Bobet was stung by this criticism. He had given his all for the Tour but everyone had turned against him. Even Jean Robic, who was not really in Bobet's class, was now more popular and it really hurt.<ref name=\"Ont'Wheel\"/></blockquote>\n\nAnd then in 1953, after a year without the Tour, Bobet left the field behind on a stage that crossed the [[Col de Vars|Vars]]. He climbed the [[Col d'Izoard]] alone on roads still rutted and strewn with stones and when the gearing on his bicycle forced him to fight to keep it moving.<ref>[http://www.ina.fr/archivespourtous/index.php?vue=notice&from=fulltext&full=izoard&num_notice=1&total_notices=16 INA, National archives, Television pictures ]</ref>  The historian Bill McGann wrote:\n<blockquote>Stage 18 is etched in the history of the Tour. It was 165km from [[Gap, Hautes-Alpes|Gap]] to [[Brian\u00e7on]]... Bobet knew this was the time to strike. One of Bobet's team-mates, [[Adolphe Deledda]], went clear on the Vars with two other riders. Bobet stayed with the other leading climbers as they ascended the Vars. Spanish rider [[Jesus Lorono]] attacked. The alert and very capable Bobet jumped on his wheel and the pair disappeared up the mountain. Bobet was a good descender and dropped Lorono on the way down the Vars. Meanwhile Deledda, upon being told that Bobet was on his way, eased up and waited for his captain. The two hooked up and took off across the 20km valley floor leading to the Izoard. In doing so they caught and then dispatched Deledda's two original breakaway companions. Bobet and Deledda, knowing the importance of the moment, were men on a mission. Deledda, fulfilling the team contract in both letter and especially in spirit, buried himself towing Bobet to the great mountain. Bobet flew up the Izoard as if he had wings. Bobet had finally arrived as the premier stage racer in the world. As he crested the Izoard there was a very well known cycling fan by the side of the road. Fausto Coppi with his mistress, Giulia Locatelli (the \"woman in white\"), was watching the race. As he rode past the great man, Bobet shouted thanks to Coppi for coming.<ref name=\"Mcgann 197\">McGann, Bill and Carol (2006), The Story of the Tour de France, Dog Ear, USA pp196-197</ref></blockquote>\n\nHe won that day by more than five minutes in [[Brian\u00e7on]], took the yellow jersey as leader of the [[General classification in the Tour de France|general classification]], then won the [[time trial]] and finished the Tour with 14 minutes' lead. He was greeted in Paris by [[Maurice Garin]],<ref name=\"Mcgann 197\"/> winner of the first Tour in 1903, celebrating the Tour's 50th anniversary. He had, however, won a Tour without stars. K\u00fcbler was not riding and nor was Coppi, who was standing on the Izoard to watch Bobet pass.<ref>Cycle Sport, UK, November 1996</ref><ref>[http://www.ina.fr/archivespourtous/index.php?vue=notice&from=fulltext&full=izoard&num_notice=1&total_notices=16 Ina.fr]</ref><ref>The pictures taken that day of Coppi with his mistress were printed without comment next day but soon became part of the \"Woman in White\" scandal that harmed Coppi's career and reputation.</ref> Koblet was riding badly and dropped out after a crash. Bartali was too old. Yates' assessment is that \"Bobet had won the Tour and won it well but the opposition was hardly top drawer.\n\n===Tour de France 1954===\n[[File:Louison Bobet, Tour de France 1954.jpg|thumb|Bobet at the [[1954 Tour de France]]]]\nThe 1954 race was different, without Italians but with a strong team from Belgium. The race started fast and didn't ease up. Bobet took the lead after four days, then lost it on day  eight. The jersey changed hands until Bobet again dominated on the Izoard. Winning the time-trial cemented his lead and he got to Paris 15 minutes before K\u00fcbler A few weeks later he became world champion in Germany. He left Stella after eight years to ride for [[Mercier (cycling team)|Mercier]], the team riding bicycles carrying Bobet's name and sold by him but made in the Mercier factory in [[St-\u00c9tienne]].\n\n===Tour de France 1955===\nBobet completed his hat-trick of successive wins in 1955, having that year won the Tour of Flanders and [[Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9|Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9]]. The strongest French rider at first was [[Antonin Rolland]] and the manager, Marcel Bidot, asked the team to ride for him. Rolland, however, grew weaker as the race approached the Pyrenees. Bobet won the Tour but with a saddle boil that needed surgery. \"His flesh was full of holes\", said a report. \"Dead tissue had to be removed to within several millimetres of vital organs. Nobody dared speak the word '[[cancer]]'\"<ref name=\"JodeF\">[[Jours de France]], France, 28 June 1958</ref> Bobet believed that enduring the sores during the Tour made him a lesser rider for the rest of his life.<ref>McGann, Bill and Carol (2006), The Story of the Tour de France, Dog Ear, USA pp213</ref>\n\nHe learned to fly a plane while forced not to ride.\n\n===Tour de France 1958===\nThe 1958 was the last that Bobet finished. One account said:\n\n<blockquote>He has 400,000 kilometres in his legs. He has conquered glory and fortune but he is badly ill. Despite the formal advice of his doctor, he has decided to ride the 1958 Tour de France. He will suffer. He knows that. In the heart of the gigantic rocks of the Cass\u00e9 D\u00e9serte, Bob is arced on his bicycle, his kidneys crushed by the effort and his head, like a heavy, painful balance, oscillates above his handlebars. The sun beats down on him. Around him, the whole mountain smokes like a giant witch's cauldron. As he breathes, what burns his throat and his lungs is the dust that rises around him... Abandoned, alone, without help, streaming with sweat, he has no other weapon against his adversaries but the mountain, the bad weather and his crazy willpower.<ref name=\"JodeF\"/></blockquote>\n\nHe came seventh.\n\n{{Quote box\n| quote = Those who knew Bobet well stayed out of his way during the week before a big race, as he was neurotic and totally unbearable. Normally urbane, charming, interesting and witty, he could become vindictive, spiteful, mean and petty towards those devoted to his cause, and he never hesitated to get rid of a team-mate if he upset him.\n\nThat he relied enormously on the help of Marcel Bidot, G\u00e9miniani and his brother, Jean, is without question, but really the story of Bobet is the story of a man who conquered himself. Divorced from his first wife and separated from his second, Louison was obviously not the easiest man to get on with - but what a champion!\n| source = Dick Yates<ref name=\"Ont'Wheel\"/> \n| width  = 25%\n | align  =right\n}}\n\n==Personality==\nThe most striking feature of Bobet the man rather than rider was his ambition to behave like a Hollywood matin\u00e9e idol, a sort of [[David Niven]] character in a dinner suit [[tuxedo]]. It brought him much ribbing from other French riders. G\u00e9miniani says Bobet's diffident and elegant manner made him less popular even in his own [[Brittany]] than the more rustic, forthright manners of other [[Breton people]] such as [[Jean Robic]].<ref>L'\u00c9quipe, 9 July 2006</ref> The British professional [[Brian Robinson (cyclist)|Brian Robinson]] called Bobet \"a private man and a little moody\" and said he would sulk if things went wrong. The French journalist [[Ren\u00e9 de Latour]] said of Bobet in [[Sporting Cyclist]] that \"he didn't look good on a bike\" and that he had \"the legs of a football [soccer] player\".\n\nBobet spoke out against French involvement in a war against [[communists]] in [[Indo-China]]. He said he wasn't a [[Marxist]] but a [[pacifist]]. G\u00e9miniani said Bobet lacked humility. \"He really thought that, after him, there'd be no more cycling in France\", he said.<ref name=\"L'Equipe 9 July 2003\">L'\u00c9quipe, France, 1 July 2003</ref> Bobet occasionally talked of himself in the third person.<ref name=\"L'Equipe 9 July 2003\"/>\n\nBobet was driven by personal hygiene and refused to accept his first yellow jersey because it had not been made with the pure wool he believed the only healthy material for a sweating and dusty rider. Synthetic thread or blends were added in 1947 following the arrival of Sofil as a sponsor. Sofil made artificial yarn.<ref name=\"Goddet\">Goddet, Jacques, ''L'\u00c9quip\u00e9e Belle'', Laffont, France</ref> The race organiser, [[Jacques Goddet]] wrote:\n<blockquote>It produced a real drama. Our contract with Sofil was crumbling away. If the news had got out, the commercial effect would have been disastrous for the manufacturer. I remember debating it with him a good part of the night. Louison was always exquisitely courteous but his principles were as hard as the granite blocks of his native Brittany coast.<ref name=\"Goddet\"/></blockquote>\n\nGoddet had to get Sofil to produce another jersey overnight, its logo still visible but artificial fabric absent. \nBobet's concern with hygiene and clothing was accentuated by frequent problems with saddle sores.<ref name=\"Mcgann 197\"/>\n\n==Raymond Le Bert==\nBobet was one of the first riders to employ a personal [[soigneur]], taking his lead from Coppi. He took on Raymond Le Bert, a [[physiotherapist]] from [[St-Brieuc]], as well as a secretary and a driver.<ref name=\"L'Equipe 9 July 2003\"/> Le Bert booked him hotel rooms between half-stages of the Tour, against the Tour's rules. Riders were supposed to use a dormitory provided for them. When the Tour insisted riders carry spare tyres, usually round their shoulders, Le Bert gave Bobet tubulars with the inner tubes taken out, useless to ride on but lighter to carry if that's what the rules insisted.<ref name=\"L'Equipe 9 July 2003\"/>\n\nLe Bert said he had met Coppi, whom Bobet admired for his \"modern\" techniques but refused to have anything to do with the Italian's suitcase of drugs.<ref>de Mondenard, Pierre (2000), Dopage, l'imposture des Performances, Charron, France, p111</ref> Bobet insisted he never took drugs. But the journalist and race organiser, Jean Leulliot, remembered a dinner organised by [[Jacques Goddet]] and [[F\u00e9lix L\u00e9vitan]], the organisers of the Tour de France, for the race's former winners. Leulliot wrote:\n\n<blockquote>One table attracted particular attention. Around it were Anquetil, Merckx and Bobet, 13 victories in the Tour between them. The conversation at the table was particularly lively and Louison Bobet was being challenged for saying that he had never taken the slightest drug or stimulant. He was obliged to admit that he had drunk the small bottles prepared for him by his soigneur at the time without knowing exactly what they contained. Which produced laughter from [[Jacques Anquetil]] and [[Eddy Merckx]].<ref>Sud-Ouest, France, 24 July 1978, cited de Mondenard, Pierre (2000), Dopage, l'imposture des Performances, Charron, France, p111</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Bobet and Britain==\nBobet presented prizes at the annual presentation of the [[British Best All-Rounder]] time-trial competition at the [[Royal Albert Hall]], London, in 1954.<ref name=\"SportingCyc\">Sporting Cyclist, UK, November 1966, p19</ref> He gave a yellow jersey to a veteran competitor, Vic Gibbons.<ref>Journal, Fellowship of Cycling Old-Timers, UK, vol 141</ref> Bobet flew from Paris to London in a [[de Havilland]] Dove chartered by a London timber-merchant and cycling enthusiast, Vic Jenner.<ref>Jenner put up the money to launch ''[[Sporting Cyclist]]'' and was about to contract Jacques Anquetil to ride a time-trial under British rules when he died.</ref> Jock Wadley, the editor of ''[[Sporting Cyclist]]'' was with Jenner. He remember that the two Britons arrived at [[Le Bourget]] airport without having brought passports - but that immigration staff gave them no attention because they were too busy trying to get an autograph from Bobet.<ref name=\"SportingCyc\"/>\n\n==Retirement and death==\n[[File:Le Touquet-Paris-Plage (Avenue Louison Bobet).JPG|thumb|right|250px|Road named for the cycling great]]\nBobet's career effectively ended when the car carrying him and his brother [[Jean Bobet|Jean]] crashed outside Paris in the autumn of 1960.\n\nLouison Bobet had a succession of businesses after he stopped racing, including a clothes shop, but he became best known for investing in and developing the seawater health treatment of [[thalassotherapy]]. He had used it when recovering from his car crash. He opened the Louison Bobet centre beside the sea at Port du Crouesty at [[Quiberon]].<ref>It still exists, now known as Miramar Crouesty</ref> The Quiberon centre was purchased by [[Accor]] in 1984 and became the flagship of its [[Thalassa Sea & Spa]] brand.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://group.accor.com/en/group/who-we-are/our-history|title=Accor - Our history|website=group.accor.com|language=en|access-date=2020-01-09}}</ref> He fell ill, however, and died of cancer<ref name=\"Ont'Wheel\"/> the day after his 58th birthday. Cancer had been speculated during the operation for his saddle boils. Bobet is interred in the cemetery of Saint-M\u00e9en-le-Grand, and there is a museum to his memory in the town,<ref>[http://www.cityzeum.com/musee-louison-bobet Mus\u00e9e Louison Bobet], 5 rue de Gael, Saint-M\u00e9en-le-Grand</ref> the idea of village postmaster Raymond Qu\u00e9rat.\n\n==Career achievements==\n===Major results===\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n;

His father gave him a bicycle when he was two and after six months he could ride it 6&nbsp;km.<ref name=\"Ont'Wheel\">On the Wheel, USA, undated cutting</ref> Bobet's father was also called Louis and the son was called Louison - little Louis - to avoid confusion The ending ''-on'' is a diminutive in French but outside Brittany Louison refers more usually to a girl. He was known as Louis in his early years as a rider, even as a professional, until the diminutive Louison gained in popularity.<ref name=\"Ont'Wheel\"/>\n\nHis sister played [[table tennis]], his brother [[Jean Bobet|Jean]] [[Association football|football]], although he also became a professional cyclist. Louison played both table tennis<ref name=\"The Bicycle, UK, 4 July 1951, p24\">The Bicycle, UK, 4 July 1951, p24</ref> and football and became Brittany champion at table tennis.<ref name=\"Ont'Wheel\"/> It was his uncle, Raymond, who was president of a cycling club in Paris who persuaded him to concentrate on cycling.<ref name=\"Ont'Wheel\"/>\n\nBobet's first race was a 30&nbsp;km event when he was 13. He came second in a sprint finish.<ref name=\"The Bicycle, UK, 4 July 1951, p24\"/> He raced in his local area and won four events for unlicensed riders<ref>Unlicensed riders did not have a licence from the national cycling organisation</ref> in 1941. He qualified for the final of the unofficial youth championship, the Premier Pas [[Dunlop Rubber|Dunlop]] in 1943 at [[Montlu\u00e7on]] and came sixth. The winner was [[Rapha\u00ebl G\u00e9miniani]], who would become a professional team-mate and rival.\n\nBobet is said to have carried messages for the [[French Resistance|Resistance]] during the [[second world war]]. After [[D-Day]] he joined the army and served in eastern France. He was demobilised in December 1945.<ref name=\"Ont'Wheel\"/>\n\n==Racing career==\n\nBobet applied for racing licence on leaving the army and by error was sent one for an independent, or semi-professional. He benefited from the right to compete against professionals as well as amateurs. He came second in the Brittany championship and rode the national championship in Paris. There he came up against a veteran professional, [[Marcel Bidot]], who on retirement became Bobet's manager in the national team. Bobet left the field to catch two riders who had broken clear. He dropped one and outsprinted the other to become national champion. He turned fully professional for Stella, a bicycle factory in [[Nantes]].<ref name=\"Ont'Wheel\"/>\n\n===Tour de France 1947===\n\nStella was a small team that rode mainly in Brittany. In May 1947, however, two from the team rode the Boucles de la [[Seine]] race in Paris. He won alone by six minutes. It brought him an invitation to ride the Tour de France, at that time disputed by national and regional teams. The unexpected toughness of the race forced him to go home on the ninth day, in the [[Alps]] and to cry when the going got hard. It brought him the nickname \"cry-baby\" in the bunch<ref name=\"Ont'Wheel\"/> and [[Ren\u00e9 Vietto]] referred to him as ''La Bobette'', a mock feminisation of his name, for his tears and complaining. The historian Dick Yates wrote:\n\n:He brought down the scorn of the press and everyone quickly wrote off this 'cry-baby'. [[Ren\u00e9 Vietto]] was in the yellow jersey as leader of the [[General classification in the Tour de France|general classification]] and he looked like he was going to win - he was a real man. As France forgot about him, Bobet went home to lick his wounds and listen to words of advice from his father.<ref name=\"Ont'Wheel\"/>\n\n===Tour de France 1948===\nThe former rider, [[Maurice Archambaud]], took over management of the team from L\u00e9o V\u00e9ron and took a chance on Bobet. Much had changed since the previous summer and he took the lead after the third stage, which finished near Stella's factory in Nantes. Bobet lost the yellow jersey the following day but regained it by winning the sixth stage, to [[Biarritz]]. He had 20 minutes' lead over the veteran Italian, [[Gino Bartali]] as the race entered the Alps. And then happened one of the most outstanding periods in the history of the Tour.\n\n(''See [[Gino Bartali]] for full story.'')\n\nA political crisis in Italy threatened to overthrow the government and bring the country to anarchy. The prime minister asked Bartali to distract Italians by dominating the Tour.<ref name=\"McGann 158\">McGann, Bill and Carol (2006), The Story of the Tour de France, Dog Ear, US, p158</ref> Bartali won three stages in a row and the Tour by 14 minutes. Bobet's 20 minutes on Bartali was cut to a 32-minute deficit by the time the race finished in Paris. Bobet had twice worn the yellow jersey and won two stages, however, and with the money he won he moved to Paris and bought a [[drapery]] shop for his wife.\n\n===Tour de France 1950===\nBobet did not finish in 1949, struggling from the start. He dropped out on the first day in the mountains, along with four other members of the national team. In 1950 he won the national championship at [[Montlh\u00e9ry]] south of Paris the week before the Tour and rode in the national team with G\u00e9miniani, the rider who had beaten him as a boy in the Premier Pas Dunlop. He and Bobet developed a rocky friendship, G\u00e9miniani's rough, instinctive character a contrast to the more thoughtful, quieter Bobet. The two argued frequently but remained friends. G\u00e9miniani, following the French habit of creating [[nicknames]] by doubling a syllable of a name<ref>Raymond Poulidor, named Poupou by the journalist \u00c9mile Besson, is the most prominent example</ref> referred to Bobet as ''Zonzon'',<ref name=\"Ont'Wheel\"/><ref>Chany, Pierre (1988), La Fabuleuse Histoire du Tour de France, Nathan, France</ref> a name that Bobet hated but tolerated. G\u00e9miniani had the confidence that Bobet lacked.<ref name=\"Ont'Wheel\"/>\n\nBobet and G\u00e9miniani were second and third early in the race. Both hoped to profit from the absence of [[Fausto Coppi]], who was injured, but found themselves instead up against an unbeatable [[Ferdinand K\u00fcbler]]. Bobet finished third, winning the mountain competition.\n\n===Tour de France 1953===\n{{Quote box\n| quote  = Bobet is a good climber and time-triallist who rides with authority and intelligence. He is careful with his preparation, careful with his efforts and totally serious. An outstanding rider but has a lack of confidence [''morale'']. He is extremely nervous, sensitive, worried and susceptible. But with experience he will overcome the problems. A charming friend, happy, often joking and with spirit, but some days he shuts himself off, wrapped in his worries.\n| source = Jean Bidot, team manager<ref name=\"Ont'Wheel\"/> \n| width  = 25%\n | align  =right\n}} \nBobet rode the 1951 Tour in the blue-white-red of national champion again but cracked in the mountains. Jean Bidot, the manager, sent riders to help him but in the end abandoned him to concentrate on G\u00e9miniani, the best placed. Bobet came 20th, although with a stage win. He lost 40 minutes on the last day in the mountains even though the race was taking it easy, [[Hugo Koblet]] already being unbeatable. Dick Yates said:\n\n<blockquote>It was a terrible performance for a man of his class, but although he had suffered and suffered he had not given up the struggle. While this showed character, nobody was prepared to make allowances for it. 'He is just not a stage rider,' they said. 'He'll never win the Tour. No matter how brilliant you may be, if you're not consistent you haven't got a chance.' The sensitive Bobet was stung by this criticism. He had given his all for the Tour but everyone had turned against him. Even Jean Robic, who was not really in Bobet's class, was now more popular and it really hurt.<ref name=\"Ont'Wheel\"/></blockquote>\n\nAnd then in 1953, after a year without the Tour, Bobet left the field behind on a stage that crossed the [[Col de Vars|Vars]]. He climbed the [[Col d'Izoard]] alone on roads still rutted and strewn with stones and when the gearing on his bicycle forced him to fight to keep it moving.<ref>[http://www.ina.fr/archivespourtous/index.php?vue=notice&from=fulltext&full=izoard&num_notice=1&total_notices=16 INA, National archives, Television pictures ]</ref>  The historian Bill McGann wrote:\n<blockquote>Stage 18 is etched in the history of the Tour. It was 165km from [[Gap, Hautes-Alpes|Gap]] to [[Brian\u00e7on]]... Bobet knew this was the time to strike. One of Bobet's team-mates, [[Adolphe Deledda]], went clear on the Vars with two other riders. Bobet stayed with the other leading climbers as they ascended the Vars. Spanish rider [[Jesus Lorono]] attacked. The alert and very capable Bobet jumped on his wheel and the pair disappeared up the mountain. Bobet was a good descender and dropped Lorono on the way down the Vars. Meanwhile Deledda, upon being told that Bobet was on his way, eased up and waited for his captain. The two hooked up and took off across the 20km valley floor leading to the Izoard. In doing so they caught and then dispatched Deledda's two original breakaway companions. Bobet and Deledda, knowing the importance of the moment, were men on a mission. Deledda, fulfilling the team contract in both letter and especially in spirit, buried himself towing Bobet to the great mountain. Bobet flew up the Izoard as if he had wings. Bobet had finally arrived as the premier stage racer in the world. As he crested the Izoard there was a very well known cycling fan by the side of the road. Fausto Coppi with his mistress, Giulia Locatelli (the \"woman in white\"), was watching the race. As he rode past the great man, Bobet shouted thanks to Coppi for coming.<ref name=\"Mcgann 197\">McGann, Bill and Carol (2006), The Story of the Tour de France, Dog Ear, USA pp196-197</ref></blockquote>\n\nHe won that day by more than five minutes in [[Brian\u00e7on]], took the yellow jersey as leader of the [[General classification in the Tour de France|general classification]], then won the [[time trial]] and finished the Tour with 14 minutes' lead. He was greeted in Paris by [[Maurice Garin]],<ref name=\"Mcgann 197\"/> winner of the first Tour in 1903, celebrating the Tour's 50th anniversary. He had, however, won a Tour without stars. K\u00fcbler was not riding and nor was Coppi, who was standing on the Izoard to watch Bobet pass.<ref>Cycle Sport, UK, November 1996</ref><ref>[http://www.ina.fr/archivespourtous/index.php?vue=notice&from=fulltext&full=izoard&num_notice=1&total_notices=16 Ina.fr]</ref><ref>The pictures taken that day of Coppi with his mistress were printed without comment next day but soon became part of the \"Woman in White\" scandal that harmed Coppi's career and reputation.</ref> Koblet was riding badly and dropped out after a crash. Bartali was too old. Yates' assessment is that \"Bobet had won the Tour and won it well but the opposition was hardly top drawer.\n\n===Tour de France 1954===\n[[File:Louison Bobet, Tour de France 1954.jpg|thumb|Bobet at the [[1954 Tour de France]]]]\nThe 1954 race was different, without Italians but with a strong team from Belgium. The race started fast and didn't ease up. Bobet took the lead after four days, then lost it on day  eight. The jersey changed hands until Bobet again dominated on the Izoard. Winning the time-trial cemented his lead and he got to Paris 15 minutes before K\u00fcbler A few weeks later he became world champion in Germany. He left Stella after eight years to ride for [[Mercier (cycling team)|Mercier]], the team riding bicycles carrying Bobet's name and sold by him but made in the Mercier factory in [[St-\u00c9tienne]].\n\n===Tour de France 1955===\nBobet completed his hat-trick of successive wins in 1955, having that year won the Tour of Flanders and [[Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9|Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9]]. The strongest French rider at first was [[Antonin Rolland]] and the manager, Marcel Bidot, asked the team to ride for him. Rolland, however, grew weaker as the race approached the Pyrenees. Bobet won the Tour but with a saddle boil that needed surgery. \"His flesh was full of holes\", said a report. \"Dead tissue had to be removed to within several millimetres of vital organs. Nobody dared speak the word '[[cancer]]'\"<ref name=\"JodeF\">[[Jours de France]], France, 28 June 1958</ref> Bobet believed that enduring the sores during the Tour made him a lesser rider for the rest of his life.<ref>McGann, Bill and Carol (2006), The Story of the Tour de France, Dog Ear, USA pp213</ref>\n\nHe learned to fly a plane while forced not to ride.\n\n===Tour de France 1958===\nThe 1958 was the last that Bobet finished. One account said:\n\n<blockquote>He has 400,000 kilometres in his legs. He has conquered glory and fortune but he is badly ill. Despite the formal advice of his doctor, he has decided to ride the 1958 Tour de France. He will suffer. He knows that. In the heart of the gigantic rocks of the Cass\u00e9 D\u00e9serte, Bob is arced on his bicycle, his kidneys crushed by the effort and his head, like a heavy, painful balance, oscillates above his handlebars. The sun beats down on him. Around him, the whole mountain smokes like a giant witch's cauldron. As he breathes, what burns his throat and his lungs is the dust that rises around him... Abandoned, alone, without help, streaming with sweat, he has no other weapon against his adversaries but the mountain, the bad weather and his crazy willpower.<ref name=\"JodeF\"/></blockquote>\n\nHe came seventh.\n\n{{Quote box\n| quote = Those who knew Bobet well stayed out of his way during the week before a big race, as he was neurotic and totally unbearable. Normally urbane, charming, interesting and witty, he could become vindictive, spiteful, mean and petty towards those devoted to his cause, and he never hesitated to get rid of a team-mate if he upset him.\n\nThat he relied enormously on the help of Marcel Bidot, G\u00e9miniani and his brother, Jean, is without question, but really the story of Bobet is the story of a man who conquered himself. Divorced from his first wife and separated from his second, Louison was obviously not the easiest man to get on with - but what a champion!\n| source = Dick Yates<ref name=\"Ont'Wheel\"/> \n| width  = 25%\n | align  =right\n}}\n\n==Personality==\nThe most striking feature of Bobet the man rather than rider was his ambition to behave like a Hollywood matin\u00e9e idol, a sort of [[David Niven]] character in a dinner suit [[tuxedo]]. It brought him much ribbing from other French riders. G\u00e9miniani says Bobet's diffident and elegant manner made him less popular even in his own [[Brittany]] than the more rustic, forthright manners of other [[Breton people]] such as [[Jean Robic]].<ref>L'\u00c9quipe, 9 July 2006</ref> The British professional [[Brian Robinson (cyclist)|Brian Robinson]] called Bobet \"a private man and a little moody\" and said he would sulk if things went wrong. The French journalist [[Ren\u00e9 de Latour]] said of Bobet in [[Sporting Cyclist]] that \"he didn't look good on a bike\" and that he had \"the legs of a football [soccer] player\".\n\nBobet spoke out against French involvement in a war against [[communists]] in [[Indo-China]]. He said he wasn't a [[Marxist]] but a [[pacifist]]. G\u00e9miniani said Bobet lacked humility. \"He really thought that, after him, there'd be no more cycling in France\", he said.<ref name=\"L'Equipe 9 July 2003\">L'\u00c9quipe, France, 1 July 2003</ref> Bobet occasionally talked of himself in the third person.<ref name=\"L'Equipe 9 July 2003\"/>\n\nBobet was driven by personal hygiene and refused to accept his first yellow jersey because it had not been made with the pure wool he believed the only healthy material for a sweating and dusty rider. Synthetic thread or blends were added in 1947 following the arrival of Sofil as a sponsor. Sofil made artificial yarn.<ref name=\"Goddet\">Goddet, Jacques, ''L'\u00c9quip\u00e9e Belle'', Laffont, France</ref> The race organiser, [[Jacques Goddet]] wrote:\n<blockquote>It produced a real drama. Our contract with Sofil was crumbling away. If the news had got out, the commercial effect would have been disastrous for the manufacturer. I remember debating it with him a good part of the night. Louison was always exquisitely courteous but his principles were as hard as the granite blocks of his native Brittany coast.<ref name=\"Goddet\"/></blockquote>\n\nGoddet had to get Sofil to produce another jersey overnight, its logo still visible but artificial fabric absent. \nBobet's concern with hygiene and clothing was accentuated by frequent problems with saddle sores.<ref name=\"Mcgann 197\"/>\n\n==Raymond Le Bert==\nBobet was one of the first riders to employ a personal [[soigneur]], taking his lead from Coppi. He took on Raymond Le Bert, a [[physiotherapist]] from [[St-Brieuc]], as well as a secretary and a driver.<ref name=\"L'Equipe 9 July 2003\"/> Le Bert booked him hotel rooms between half-stages of the Tour, against the Tour's rules. Riders were supposed to use a dormitory provided for them. When the Tour insisted riders carry spare tyres, usually round their shoulders, Le Bert gave Bobet tubulars with the inner tubes taken out, useless to ride on but lighter to carry if that's what the rules insisted.<ref name=\"L'Equipe 9 July 2003\"/>\n\nLe Bert said he had met Coppi, whom Bobet admired for his \"modern\" techniques but refused to have anything to do with the Italian's suitcase of drugs.<ref>de Mondenard, Pierre (2000), Dopage, l'imposture des Performances, Charron, France, p111</ref> Bobet insisted he never took drugs. But the journalist and race organiser, Jean Leulliot, remembered a dinner organised by [[Jacques Goddet]] and [[F\u00e9lix L\u00e9vitan]], the organisers of the Tour de France, for the race's former winners. Leulliot wrote:\n\n<blockquote>One table attracted particular attention. Around it were Anquetil, Merckx and Bobet, 13 victories in the Tour between them. The conversation at the table was particularly lively and Louison Bobet was being challenged for saying that he had never taken the slightest drug or stimulant. He was obliged to admit that he had drunk the small bottles prepared for him by his soigneur at the time without knowing exactly what they contained. Which produced laughter from [[Jacques Anquetil]] and [[Eddy Merckx]].<ref>Sud-Ouest, France, 24 July 1978, cited de Mondenard, Pierre (2000), Dopage, l'imposture des Performances, Charron, France, p111</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Bobet and Britain==\nBobet presented prizes at the annual presentation of the [[British Best All-Rounder]] time-trial competition at the [[Royal Albert Hall]], London, in 1954.<ref name=\"SportingCyc\">Sporting Cyclist, UK, November 1966, p19</ref> He gave a yellow jersey to a veteran competitor, Vic Gibbons.<ref>Journal, Fellowship of Cycling Old-Timers, UK, vol 141</ref> Bobet flew from Paris to London in a [[de Havilland]] Dove chartered by a London timber-merchant and cycling enthusiast, Vic Jenner.<ref>Jenner put up the money to launch ''[[Sporting Cyclist]]'' and was about to contract Jacques Anquetil to ride a time-trial under British rules when he died.</ref> Jock Wadley, the editor of ''[[Sporting Cyclist]]'' was with Jenner. He remember that the two Britons arrived at [[Le Bourget]] airport without having brought passports - but that immigration staff gave them no attention because they were too busy trying to get an autograph from Bobet.<ref name=\"SportingCyc\"/>\n\n==Retirement and death==\n[[File:Le Touquet-Paris-Plage (Avenue Louison Bobet).JPG|thumb|right|250px|Road named for the cycling great]]\nBobet's career effectively ended when the car carrying him and his brother [[Jean Bobet|Jean]] crashed outside Paris in the autumn of 1960.\n\nLouison Bobet had a succession of businesses after he stopped racing, including a clothes shop, but he became best known for investing in and developing the seawater health treatment of [[thalassotherapy]]. He had used it when recovering from his car crash. He opened the Louison Bobet centre beside the sea at Port du Crouesty at [[Quiberon]].<ref>It still exists, now known as Miramar Crouesty</ref> The Quiberon centre was purchased by [[Accor]] in 1984 and became the flagship of its [[Thalassa Sea & Spa]] brand.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://group.accor.com/en/group/who-we-are/our-history|title=Accor - Our history|website=group.accor.com|language=en|access-date=2020-01-09}}</ref> He fell ill, however, and died of cancer<ref name=\"Ont'Wheel\"/> the day after his 58th birthday. Cancer had been speculated during the operation for his saddle boils.
