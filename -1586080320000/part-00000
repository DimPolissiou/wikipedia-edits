It seeks to identify which human psychological traits are evolved [[adaptation]]s \u2013 that is, the functional products of [[natural selection]] or [[sexual selection in human evolution]]. [[Adaptationist]] thinking about physiological mechanisms, such as the heart, lungs, and immune system, is common in [[evolutionary biology]]. Some evolutionary psychologists apply the same thinking to psychology, arguing that the [[modularity of mind]] is similar to that of the body and with different modular adaptations serving different functions. Evolutionary psychologists argue that much of human behavior is the output of [[psychological adaptation]]s that evolved to solve recurrent problems in human ancestral environments.<ref>Confer et al. 2010; Buss, 2005; Durrant & Ellis, 2003; Pinker, 2002; Tooby & Cosmides, 2005</ref>\n\nEvolutionary psychology is not simply a subdiscipline of psychology but its evolutionary theory can provide a foundational, [[Metatheory|metatheoretical]] framework that integrates the entire field of psychology in the same way evolutionary biology has for biology.<ref name=Cosmides/><ref>Duntley and Buss 2008</ref><ref>Carmen, R.A., et al.

Proponents suggest that it seeks to integrate psychology into the other natural sciences, rooting it in the organizing theory of biology ([[evolutionary theory]]), and thus understanding [[psychology]] as a branch of [[biology]]. Anthropologist [[John Tooby]] and psychologist [[Leda Cosmides]] note:\n\n<blockquote>Evolutionary psychology is the long-forestalled scientific attempt to assemble out of the disjointed, fragmentary, and mutually contradictory human disciplines a single, logically integrated research framework for the psychological, social, and behavioral sciences \u2013 a framework\nthat not only incorporates the evolutionary sciences on a full and equal basis, but that systematically works out all of the revisions in existing belief and research practice that such a synthesis requires.<ref>Tooby & Cosmides 2005, p. 5</ref></blockquote>\n\nJust as human [[physiology]] and [[evolutionary physiology]] have worked to identify physical adaptations of the body that represent \"human physiological nature,\" the purpose of evolutionary psychology is to identify evolved emotional and cognitive adaptations that represent \"human psychological nature.\" According to [[Steven Pinker]], it is \"not a single theory but a large set of hypotheses\" and a term that \"has also come to refer to a particular way of applying evolutionary theory to the mind, with an emphasis on adaptation, gene-level selection, and modularity.\" Evolutionary psychology adopts an understanding of the mind that is based on the [[computational theory of mind]]. It describes mental processes as computational operations, so that, for example, a fear response is described as arising from a neurological computation that inputs the perceptional data, e.g. a visual image of a spider, and outputs the appropriate reaction, e.g. fear of possibly dangerous animals. Under this view, any [[Domain-general learning]] is impossible because of the [[Combinatorial explosion]]. This implies [[Domain-specific learning]]. Evolutionary Psychology specifies the domain as the problems of survival and reproduction.<ref>Buss, David M. \"Evolutionary Psychology: The New Science of The Mind\" 5th edition. pages 28-29.</ref>\n\nWhile philosophers have generally considered the human mind to include broad faculties, such as reason and lust, evolutionary psychologists describe evolved psychological mechanisms as narrowly focused to deal with specific issues, such as catching cheaters or choosing mates. The discipline views the [[human brain]] as comprising many functional mechanisms,{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} called ''psychological adaptations'' or evolved cognitive mechanisms or ''[[cognitive modules]]'', designed by the process of natural selection. Examples include [[language acquisition|language-acquisition modules]], [[Westermarck effect|incest-avoidance mechanisms]], [[Wason selection task|cheater-detection mechanisms]], intelligence and sex-specific mating preferences, foraging mechanisms, alliance-tracking mechanisms, agent-detection mechanisms, and others. Some mechanisms, termed ''domain-specific'', deal with recurrent adaptive problems over the course of human evolutionary history.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} ''Domain-general'' mechanisms, on the other hand, are proposed to deal with evolutionary novelty.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nEvolutionary psychology has roots in [[cognitive psychology]] and evolutionary biology but also draws on [[behavioral ecology]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[genetics]], [[ethology]], [[anthropology]], [[archaeology]], biology, and [[zoology]]. It is closely linked to [[sociobiology]],<ref name=Psychology/> but there are key differences between them including the emphasis on ''domain-specific'' rather than ''domain-general'' mechanisms, the relevance of measures of current [[fitness (biology)|fitness]], the importance of [[mismatch theory]], and psychology rather than behavior. Most of what is now labeled as sociobiological research is now confined to the field of behavioral ecology.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\n[[Nikolaas Tinbergen]]'s [[Tinbergen's four questions|four categories of questions]] can help to clarify the distinctions between several different, but complementary, types of explanations.<ref>Nesse, R.M.

In 1975, [[E.O. Wilson|Edward O. Wilson]] combined evolutionary theory with studies of animal and social behavior, building on the works of Lorenz and Tinbergen, in his book ''[[Sociobiology: The New Synthesis]]''.\n\nIn the 1970s, two major branches developed from ethology. Firstly, the study of animal ''social'' behavior (including humans) generated [[sociobiology]], defined by its pre-eminent proponent Edward O. Wilson in 1975 as \"the systematic study of the biological basis of all social behavior\"<ref>Wilson, Edward O. 1975.[http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog/WILSOR.html ''Sociobiology: The New Synthesis''.] Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Ma. {{ISBN|0-674-00089-7}} p. 4.</ref> and in 1978 as \"the extension of population biology and evolutionary theory to social organization.\"<ref>Wilson, Edward O. 1978. ''On Human Nature''. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Ma. p. x.</ref> Secondly, there was behavioral ecology which placed less emphasis on ''social'' behavior; it focused on the ecological and evolutionary basis of animal and [[human behavioral ecology|human]] behavior.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s university departments began to include the term ''evolutionary biology'' in their titles. The modern era of evolutionary psychology was ushered in, in particular, by [[Donald Symons]]' 1979 book ''[[The Evolution of Human Sexuality]]'' and [[Leda Cosmides]] and [[John Tooby]]'s 1992 book ''[[The Adapted Mind]]''.<ref name=Psychology/> David Buller observed that the term \"evolutionary psychology\" is sometimes seen as denoting research based on the specific methodological and theoretical commitments of certain researchers from the Santa Barbara school (University of California), thus some evolutionary psychologists prefer to term their work \"human ecology\", \"human behavioural ecology\" or \"evolutionary anthropology\" instead.<ref>Buller, David J. Adapting minds: Evolutionary psychology and the persistent quest for human nature. MIT press, 2006, p.8</ref>\n\nFrom psychology there are the primary streams of [[developmental psychology|developmental]], [[social psychology|social]] and cognitive psychology. Establishing some measure of the relative influence of genetics and environment on behavior has been at the core of [[Behavioural genetics|behavioral genetics]] and its variants, notably studies at the molecular level that examine the relationship between genes, neurotransmitters and behavior. [[Dual inheritance theory]] (DIT), developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s, has a slightly different perspective by trying to explain how [[human behavior]] is a product of two different and interacting evolutionary processes: [[genetic evolution]] and [[cultural evolution]]. DIT is seen by some as a \"middle-ground\" between views that emphasize human universals versus those that emphasize cultural variation.<ref>Laland, Kevin N. and Gillian R. Brown. 2002. ''Sense & Nonsense: Evolutionary Perspectives on Human Behavior.'' Oxford University Press, Oxford. pp. 287\u2013319.</ref>\n\n==Theoretical foundations==\n{{Main|Theoretical foundations of evolutionary psychology}}\nThe theories on which evolutionary psychology is based originated with Charles Darwin's work, including his speculations about the evolutionary origins of social instincts in humans. Modern evolutionary psychology, however, is possible only because of advances in evolutionary theory in the 20th century.\n\nEvolutionary psychologists say that natural selection has provided humans with many psychological adaptations, in much the same way that it generated humans' anatomical and physiological adaptations.<ref name=Gaulin-Steven-J-C-2003-pp.25-56>Gaulin and McBurney 2003 pp. 25\u201356.</ref> As with adaptations in general, psychological adaptations are said to be specialized for the environment in which an organism evolved, the environment of evolutionary adaptedness.<ref name=Gaulin-Steven-J-C-2003-pp.25-56/><ref name=Economics-2003>See also \"Environment of evolutionary adaptation,\" a variation of the term used in Economics, e.g., in {{cite journal | last1 = Rubin | first1 = Paul H | year = 2003 | title = Folk economics | journal = Southern Economic Journal | volume = 70 | issue = 1| pages = 157\u201371 | doi=10.2307/1061637| jstor = 1061637 }}</ref> Sexual selection provides organisms with adaptations related to mating.<ref name=Gaulin-Steven-J-C-2003-pp.25-56/> For male [[mammal]]s, which have a relatively high maximal potential reproduction rate, sexual selection leads to adaptations that help them compete for females.<ref name=Gaulin-Steven-J-C-2003-pp.25-56/> For female mammals, with a relatively low maximal potential reproduction rate, sexual selection leads to choosiness, which helps females select higher quality mates.<ref name=Gaulin-Steven-J-C-2003-pp.25-56/> Charles Darwin described both natural selection and sexual selection, and he relied on group selection to explain the evolution of [[Altruism|altruistic]] (self-sacrificing) behavior. But group selection was considered a weak explanation, because in any group the less altruistic individuals will be more likely to survive, and the group will become less self-sacrificing as a whole.\n\nIn 1964, [[W. D. Hamilton|William D. Hamilton]] proposed [[inclusive fitness]] theory, emphasizing a [[gene-centered view of evolution]]. Hamilton noted that genes can increase the replication of copies of themselves into the next generation by influencing the organism's social traits in such a way that (statistically) results in helping the survival and reproduction of other copies of the same genes (most simply, identical copies in the organism's close relatives). According to [[Hamilton's rule]], self-sacrificing behaviors (and the genes influencing them) can evolve if they typically help the organism's close relatives so much that it more than compensates for the individual animal's sacrifice. Inclusive fitness theory resolved the issue of how altruism can evolve. Other theories also help explain the evolution of altruistic behavior, including [[evolutionary game theory]], [[tit-for-tat]] reciprocity, and generalized reciprocity. These theories help to explain the development of altruistic behavior, and account for hostility toward cheaters (individuals that take advantage of others' altruism).<ref name=moralanimal/>\n\nSeveral mid-level evolutionary theories inform evolutionary psychology. The [[r/K selection]] theory proposes that some species prosper by having many offspring, while others follow the strategy of having fewer offspring but investing much more in each one. Humans follow the second strategy. Parental investment theory explains how parents invest more or less in individual offspring based on how successful those offspring are likely to be, and thus how much they might improve the parents' inclusive fitness. According to the [[Trivers\u2013Willard hypothesis]], parents in good conditions tend to invest more in sons (who are best able to take advantage of good conditions), while parents in poor conditions tend to invest more in daughters (who are best able to have successful offspring even in poor conditions). According to [[life history theory]], animals evolve life histories to match their environments, determining details such as age at first reproduction and number of offspring. Dual inheritance theory posits that genes and human culture have interacted, with genes affecting the development of culture, and culture, in turn, affecting human evolution on a genetic level (see also the [[Baldwin effect]]).\n\n==Evolved psychological mechanisms==\n{{Main|psychological adaptation|l1=Evolved psychological mechanisms}}\nEvolutionary psychology is based on the hypothesis that, just like hearts, lungs, livers, kidneys, and immune systems, cognition has functional structure that has a genetic basis, and therefore has evolved by natural selection. Like other organs and tissues, this functional structure should be universally shared amongst a species, and should solve important problems of survival and [[reproduction]].\n\nEvolutionary psychologists seek to understand psychological mechanisms by understanding the survival and reproductive functions they might have served over the course of evolutionary history.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} These might include abilities to infer others' emotions, discern kin from non-kin, identify and prefer healthier mates, cooperate with others and follow leaders. Consistent with the theory of natural selection, evolutionary psychology sees humans as often in conflict with others, including mates and relatives. For instance, a mother may wish to wean her offspring from breastfeeding earlier than does her infant, which frees up the mother to invest in additional offspring.<ref name=moralanimal/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://scilib-biology.narod.ru/MoralAnimal/index_en.html |title=The Moral Animal: Why We Are The Way We Are: The New Science of Evolutionary Psychology |accessdate=15 October 2013 |first=Robert |last=Wright}}</ref> Evolutionary psychology also recognizes the role of kin selection and reciprocity in evolving prosocial traits such as altruism.<ref name=moralanimal/> Like [[common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]s and [[bonobo]]s, humans have subtle and flexible social instincts, allowing them to form extended families, lifelong friendships, and political alliances.<ref name=moralanimal/> In studies testing theoretical predictions, evolutionary psychologists have made modest findings on topics such as infanticide, intelligence, marriage patterns, promiscuity, perception of beauty, bride price and parental investment.<ref name=social-behavior/>\n\n===Historical topics===\nProponents of evolutionary psychology in the 1990s made some explorations in historical events, but the response from historical experts was highly negative and there has been little effort to continue that line of research. Historian [[Lynn Hunt]] says that the historians complained that the researchers:\n:have read the wrong studies, misinterpreted the results of experiments, or worse yet, turned to neuroscience looking for a universalizing, anti-representational and anti-intentional ontology to bolster their claims.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hunt | first1 = Lynn | year = 2014 | title = The Self and Its History | url = | journal = American Historical Review | volume = 119 | issue = 5| pages = 1576\u201386 | doi=10.1093/ahr/119.5.1576}} quote p 1576.</ref>\n\nHunt states that, \"the few attempts to build up a subfield of psychohistory collapsed under the weight of its presuppositions.\" She concludes that as of 2014 the \"'iron curtain' between historians and psychology...remains standing.\"<ref>Hunt, \"The Self and Its History.\" p. 1578.</ref>\n\n===Products of evolution: adaptations, exaptations, byproducts, and random variation===\nNot all traits of organisms are evolutionary adaptations. As noted in the table below, traits may also be [[exaptation]]s, byproducts of adaptations (sometimes called \"spandrels\"), or random variation between individuals.<ref>Buss et al. 1998</ref>\n\nPsychological adaptations are hypothesized to be innate or relatively easy to learn, and to manifest in cultures worldwide. For example, the ability of toddlers to learn a language with virtually no training is likely to be a psychological adaptation. On the other hand, ancestral humans did not read or write, thus today, learning to read and write require extensive training, and presumably involves the repurposing of cognitive capacities that evolved in response to selection pressures unrelated to written language.<ref>Pinker, Steven. (1994) The Language Instinct</ref> However, variations in manifest behavior can result from universal mechanisms interacting with different local environments. For example, Caucasians who move from a northern climate to the equator will have darker skin. The mechanisms regulating their pigmentation do not change; rather the input to those mechanisms change, resulting in different output.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! !! Adaptation !! Exaptation !!

[[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]] suggested that an \"adaptation is a special and onerous concept that should only be used where it is really necessary.\"<ref>George C Williams, ''Adaptation and Natural Selection''. p. 4.</ref> As noted by Williams and others, adaptations can be identified by their improbable complexity, species universality, and adaptive functionality.\n\n===Obligate and facultative adaptations===\nA question that may be asked about an adaptation is whether it is generally obligate (relatively robust in the face of typical environmental variation) or facultative (sensitive to typical environmental variation).<ref name=Buss-D-M-2011>Buss, D. M. (2011). Evolutionary psychology.</ref> The sweet taste of sugar and the pain of hitting one's knee against concrete are the result of fairly obligate psychological adaptations; typical environmental variability during development does not much affect their operation. By contrast, facultative adaptations are somewhat like \"if-then\" statements. For example, adult attachment style seems particularly sensitive to early childhood experiences. As adults, the propensity to develop close, trusting bonds with others is dependent on whether early childhood caregivers could be trusted to provide reliable assistance and attention. The adaptation for skin to tan is conditional to exposure to sunlight; this is an example of another facultative adaptation. When a psychological adaptation is facultative, evolutionary psychologists concern themselves with how developmental and environmental inputs influence the expression of the adaptation.\n\n===Cultural universals===\n{{main|Cultural universal}}\nEvolutionary psychologists hold that behaviors or traits that occur universally in all cultures are good candidates for evolutionary adaptations.<ref name=Psychology/> Cultural universals include behaviors related to language, cognition, social roles, gender roles, and technology.<ref>[[Donald E. Brown|Brown, Donald E.]] (1991) Human Universals. New York: McGraw-Hill.</ref> Evolved psychological adaptations (such as the ability to learn a language) interact with cultural inputs to produce specific behaviors (e.g., the specific language learned).\n\nBasic gender differences, such as greater eagerness for sex among men and greater coyness among women,<ref>Symons, D. (1979). The evolution of human sexuality. Oxford: Oxford University Press. Chapter 6.</ref> are explained as sexually dimorphic psychological adaptations that reflect the different reproductive strategies of males and females.<ref name=\"moralanimal\" /><ref name=\"BS\">Pinker 2002</ref> Research has also shown participants were able to recognize the facial expression of fear significantly better on a male face than on a female face.

That environment is often referred to as the \"environment of evolutionary adaptedness\".<ref name=Economics-2003/>\n\nThe idea of an ''environment of evolutionary adaptedness'' was first explored as a part of [[attachment theory]] by [[John Bowlby]].<ref name=Bowlby1969>{{cite book |last=Bowlby |first=John |title=Attachment |url=https://archive.org/details/attachment01bowl |url-access=registration |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |year=1969}}</ref> This is the environment to which a particular evolved mechanism is adapted. More specifically, the environment of evolutionary adaptedness is defined as the set of historically recurring selection pressures that formed a given adaptation, as well as those aspects of the environment that were necessary for the proper development and functioning of the adaptation.\n\nHumans, comprising the genus ''[[Homo (genus)|Homo]]'', appeared between 1.5 and 2.5 million years ago, a time that roughly coincides with the start of the [[Pleistocene]] 2.6 million years ago. Because the Pleistocene ended a mere 12,000 years ago, most human adaptations either newly evolved during the Pleistocene, or were maintained by [[stabilizing selection]] during the Pleistocene. Evolutionary psychology therefore proposes that the majority of human psychological mechanisms are adapted to reproductive problems frequently encountered in Pleistocene environments.<ref name=Symons1992>{{cite book |last=Symons |first=Donald |authorlink=Donald Symons |chapter=On the use and misuse of Darwinism in the study of human behavior |title=The Adapted Mind: Evolutionary psychology and the generation of culture |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1992 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/adaptedmindevolu0000unse/page/137 137\u201359] |isbn=978-0-19-510107-2 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/adaptedmindevolu0000unse/page/137 }}</ref> In broad terms, these problems include those of growth, development, differentiation, maintenance, mating, parenting, and social relationships.\n\nThe environment of evolutionary adaptedness is significantly different from modern society.<ref name=EBO-social/> The ancestors of modern humans lived in smaller groups, had more cohesive cultures, and had more stable and rich contexts for identity and meaning.<ref name=EBO-social>\"social behaviour, animal.\" Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.

[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/550897/animal-social-behaviour].</ref> Researchers look to existing hunter-gatherer societies for clues as to how hunter-gatherers lived in the environment of evolutionary adaptedness.<ref name=moralanimal/> Unfortunately, the few surviving hunter-gatherer societies are different from each other, and they have been pushed out of the best land and into harsh environments, so it is not clear how closely they reflect ancestral culture.<ref name=moralanimal/> However, all around the world small-band hunter-gatherers offer a similar developmental system for the young (\"hunter-gatherer childhood model,\" Konner, 2005; \n\"evolved developmental niche\" or \"evolved nest;\" Narvaez et al., 2013). The characteristics of the niche are largely the same as for social mammals, who evolved over 30 million years ago: soothing perinatal experience, several years of on-request breastfeeding, nearly constant affection or physical proximity, responsiveness to need (mitigating offspring distress), self-directed play, and for humans, multiple responsive caregivers. Initial studies show the importance of these components in early life for positive child outcomes.{{sfn|Narvaez|Gleason|Wang|Brooks|2013}}{{sfn|Narvaez| Wang|Gleason|Cheng|2012}}\n\nEvolutionary psychologists sometimes look to chimpanzees, bonobos, and other great apes for insight into human ancestral behavior.<ref name=moralanimal>Wright 1995</ref>\n\n===Mismatches===\n\nSince an organism's adaptations were suited to its ancestral environment, a new and different environment can create a mismatch. Because humans are mostly adapted to [[Pleistocene]] environments, psychological mechanisms sometimes exhibit \"mismatches\" to the modern environment. One example is the fact that although about 10,000 people are killed with guns in the US annually,<ref>[https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr54/nvsr54_10.pdf CDC pdf]</ref> whereas spiders and snakes kill only a handful, people nonetheless learn to fear spiders and snakes about as easily as they do a pointed gun, and more easily than an unpointed gun, rabbits or flowers.<ref name=Ohman2001>{{cite journal |last1=Ohman |first1=A. |last2=Mineka |first2=S. |year=2001 |title=Fears, phobias, and preparedness: Toward an evolved module of fear and fear learning |journal=Psychological Review |volume=108 |issue=3 |pages=483\u2013522 |url=http://instruct.uwo.ca/psychology/371g/Ohman2001.pdf |accessdate=16 June 2008 |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.108.3.483 |pmid=11488376}}</ref> A potential explanation is that spiders and snakes were a threat to human ancestors throughout the Pleistocene, whereas guns (and rabbits and flowers) were not.

The term was coined by [[Niko Tinbergen]] to refer to non-human animal behavior, but psychologist [[Deirdre Barrett]] said that supernormal stimulation governs the behavior of humans as powerfully as that of other animals. She explained junk food as an exaggerated stimulus to cravings for salt, sugar, and fats,<ref>Barrett, Deirdre. Waistland: The R/Evolutionary Science Behind Our Weight and Fitness Crisis (2007).

One of the major goals of adaptationist research is to identify which organismic traits are likely to be adaptations, and which are byproducts or random variations. As noted earlier, adaptations are expected to show evidence of complexity, functionality, and species universality, while byproducts or random variation will not. In addition, adaptations are expected to manifest as proximate mechanisms that interact with the environment in either a generally obligate or facultative fashion (see above). Evolutionary psychologists are also interested in identifying these proximate mechanisms (sometimes termed \"mental mechanisms\" or \"psychological adaptations\") and what type of information they take as input, how they process that information, and their outputs.<ref name=Buss-D-M-2011/> [[Evolutionary developmental psychology]], or \"evo-devo,\" focuses on how adaptations may be activated at certain developmental times (e.g., losing baby teeth, adolescence, etc.) or how events during the development of an individual may alter life history trajectories.\n\nEvolutionary psychologists use several strategies to develop and test hypotheses about whether a psychological trait is likely to be an evolved adaptation. Buss (2011)<ref>Buss, D.M. (2011). Evolutionary psychology. Chapter 2. Boston: Pearson/A and B.</ref> notes that these methods include:\n\n:''Cross-cultural Consistency.'' Characteristics that have been demonstrated to be cross cultural [[human universals]] such as smiling, crying, facial expressions are presumed to be evolved psychological adaptations. Several evolutionary psychologists have collected massive datasets from cultures around the world to assess cross-cultural universality.\n\n:''Function to Form (or \"problem to solution\").'' The fact that males, but not females, risk potential misidentification of genetic offspring (referred to as \"paternity insecurity\") led evolutionary psychologists to hypothesize that, compared to females, male jealousy would be more focused on sexual, rather than emotional, infidelity.\n\n:''Form to Function (reverse-engineering \u2013 or \"solution to problem\").'' [[Morning sickness]], and associated aversions to certain types of food, during pregnancy seemed to have the characteristics of an evolved adaptation (complexity and universality). [[Margie Profet]] hypothesized that the function was to avoid the ingestion of toxins during early pregnancy that could damage fetus (but which are otherwise likely to be harmless to healthy non-pregnant women).\n\n:''Corresponding Neurological Modules.'' Evolutionary psychology and cognitive neuropsychology are mutually compatible \u2013 evolutionary psychology helps to identify psychological adaptations and their ultimate, evolutionary functions, while neuropsychology helps to identify the proximate manifestations of these adaptations.\n\n:''Current evolutionary Adaptiveness.'' In addition to evolutionary models that suggest evolution occurs across large spans of time, recent research has demonstrated that some evolutionary shifts can be fast and dramatic. Consequently, some evolutionary psychologists have focused on the impact of psychological traits in the current environment. Such research can be used to inform estimates of the prevalence of traits over time. Such work has been informative in studying evolutionary psychopathology.<ref>Jacobson, N.C. (2016).

Baars]].<ref>Baars, Bernard J. ''A Cognitive Theory of Consciousness.'' 1993. Cambridge University Press.</ref> [[Richard Dawkins]] suggested that humans evolved consciousness in order to make themselves the subjects of thought.<ref name=Gaulin-5/> Daniel Povinelli suggests that large, tree-climbing apes evolved consciousness to take into account one's own mass when moving safely among tree branches.<ref name=Gaulin-5/> Consistent with this hypothesis, [[Gordon Gallup]] found that chimps and orangutans, but not little monkeys or terrestrial gorillas, demonstrated self-awareness in mirror tests.<ref name=Gaulin-5/>\n\nThe concept of consciousness can refer to voluntary action, awareness, or wakefulness. However, even voluntary behavior involves unconscious mechanisms. Many cognitive processes take place in the cognitive unconscious, unavailable to conscious awareness. Some behaviors are conscious when learned but then become unconscious, seemingly automatic. Learning, especially implicitly learning a skill, can take place outside of consciousness. For example, plenty of people know how to turn right when they ride a bike, but very few can accurately explain how they actually do so. Evolutionary psychology approaches self-deception as an adaptation that can improve one's results in social exchanges.<ref name=Gaulin-5/>\n\nSleep may have evolved to conserve energy when activity would be less fruitful or more dangerous, such as at night, and especially during the winter season.<ref name=Gaulin-5>Gaulin and McBurney 2003 p. 101\u201321.</ref>\n\n====Sensation and perception====\n{{See also|Sensation (psychology)|perception}}\n\nMany experts, such as [[Jerry Fodor]], write that the purpose of perception is knowledge, but evolutionary psychologists hold that its primary purpose is to guide action.<ref name=Gaulin-4/> For example, they say, [[depth perception]] seems to have evolved not to help us know the distances to other objects but rather to help us move around in space.<ref name=Gaulin-4/> Evolutionary psychologists say that animals from fiddler crabs to humans use eyesight for collision avoidance, suggesting that vision is basically for directing action, not providing knowledge.<ref name=Gaulin-4>Gaulin and McBurney 2003 pp. 81\u2013101.</ref>\n\nBuilding and maintaining sense organs is metabolically expensive, so these organs evolve only when they improve an organism's fitness.<ref name=Gaulin-4/> More than half the brain is devoted to processing sensory information, and the brain itself consumes roughly one-fourth of one's metabolic resources, so the senses must provide exceptional benefits to fitness.<ref name=Gaulin-4/> Perception accurately mirrors the world; animals get useful, accurate information through their senses.<ref name=Gaulin-4/>\n\nScientists who study perception and sensation have long understood the human senses as adaptations to their surrounding worlds.<ref name=Gaulin-4/> Depth perception consists of processing over half a dozen visual cues, each of which is based on a regularity of the physical world.<ref name=Gaulin-4/> Vision evolved to respond to the narrow range of electromagnetic energy that is plentiful and that does not pass through objects.<ref name=Gaulin-4/> Sound waves go around corners and interact with obstacles, creating a complex pattern that includes useful information about the sources of and distances to objects.<ref name=Gaulin-4/> Larger animals naturally make lower-pitched sounds as a consequence of their size.<ref name=Gaulin-4/> The range over which an animal hears, on the other hand, is determined by adaptation. Homing pigeons, for example, can hear very low-pitched sound (infrasound) that carries great distances, even though most smaller animals detect higher-pitched sounds.<ref name=Gaulin-4/> Taste and smell respond to chemicals in the environment that are thought to have been significant for fitness in the environment of evolutionary adaptedness.<ref name=Gaulin-4/> For example, salt and sugar were apparently both valuable to the human or pre-human inhabitants of the environment of evolutionary adaptedness, so present day humans have an intrinsic hunger for salty and sweet tastes.<ref name=Gaulin-4/> The sense of touch is actually many senses, including pressure, heat, cold, tickle, and pain.<ref name=Gaulin-4/> Pain, while unpleasant, is adaptive.<ref name=Gaulin-4/> An important adaptation for senses is range shifting, by which the organism becomes temporarily more or less sensitive to sensation.<ref name=Gaulin-4/> For example, one's eyes automatically adjust to dim or bright ambient light.<ref name=Gaulin-4/> Sensory abilities of different organisms often coevolve, as is the case with the hearing of echolocating bats and that of the moths that have evolved to respond to the sounds that the bats make.<ref name=Gaulin-4/>\n\nEvolutionary psychologists contend that perception demonstrates the principle of modularity, with specialized mechanisms handling particular perception tasks.<ref name=Gaulin-4/> For example, people with damage to a particular part of the brain suffer from the specific defect of not being able to recognize faces (prosopagnosia).<ref name=Gaulin-4/> Evolutionary psychology suggests that this indicates a so-called face-reading module.<ref name=Gaulin-4/>\n\n====Learning and facultative adaptations====\nIn evolutionary psychology, learning is said to be accomplished through evolved capacities, specifically facultative adaptations.<ref name=LearningG8>Gaulin and McBurney 2003 Chapter 8.</ref> Facultative adaptations express themselves differently depending on input from the environment.<ref name=LearningG8/> Sometimes the input comes during development and helps shape that development.<ref name=LearningG8/> For example, migrating birds learn to orient themselves by the stars during a critical period in their maturation.<ref name=LearningG8/> Evolutionary psychologists believe that humans also learn language along an evolved program, also with critical periods.<ref name=LearningG8/> The input can also come during daily tasks, helping the organism cope with changing environmental conditions.<ref name=LearningG8/> For example, animals evolved Pavlovian conditioning in order to solve problems about causal relationships.<ref name=LearningG8/> Animals accomplish learning tasks most easily when those tasks resemble problems that they faced in their evolutionary past, such as a rat learning where to find food or water.<ref name=LearningG8/> Learning capacities sometimes demonstrate differences between the sexes.<ref name=LearningG8/> In many animal species, for example, males can solve spatial problem faster and more accurately than females, due to the effects of male hormones during development.<ref name=LearningG8/> The same might be true of humans.<ref name=LearningG8/>\n\n====Emotion and motivation====\n{{Main|Evolution of emotion}}\nMotivations direct and energize behavior, while emotions provide the affective component to motivation, positive or negative.<ref name=Gaulin-6>Gaulin and McBurney 2003 pp. 121\u201342.</ref> In the early 1970s, [[Paul Ekman]] and colleagues began a line of research which suggests that many emotions are universal.<ref name=Gaulin-6/> He found evidence that humans share at least five basic emotions: fear, sadness, happiness, anger, and disgust.<ref name=Gaulin-6/> Social emotions evidently evolved to motivate social behaviors that were adaptive in the environment of evolutionary adaptedness.<ref name=Gaulin-6/> For example, spite seems to work against the individual but it can establish an individual's reputation as someone to be feared.<ref name=Gaulin-6/> Shame and pride can motivate behaviors that help one maintain one's standing in a community, and self-esteem is one's estimate of one's status.<ref name=moralanimal/><ref name=Gaulin-6/>\nMotivation has a neurobiological basis in the [[reward system]] of the brain. Recently, it has been suggested that reward systems may evolve in such a way that there may be an [[inherent]] or unavoidable [[trade-off]] in the motivational system for activities of short versus long duration.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Belke | first1 = T.

From an evolutionary psychology perspective, cognition is not \"general purpose,\" but uses heuristics, or strategies, that generally increase the likelihood of solving problems that the ancestors of present-day humans routinely faced. For example, present day humans are far more likely to solve logic problems that involve detecting cheating (a common problem given humans' social nature) than the same logic problem put in purely abstract terms.<ref name=Gaulin-7>Gaulin and McBurney 2003 Chapter 7.</ref> Since the ancestors of present-day humans did not encounter truly random events, present day humans may be cognitively predisposed to incorrectly identify patterns in random sequences. \"Gamblers' Fallacy\" is one example of this. Gamblers may falsely believe that they have hit a \"lucky streak\" even when each outcome is actually random and independent of previous trials. Most people believe that if a fair coin has been flipped 9 times and Heads appears each time, that on the tenth flip, there is a greater than 50% chance of getting Tails.<ref name=Gaulin-6/> Humans find it far easier to make diagnoses or predictions using frequency data than when the same information is presented as probabilities or percentages, presumably because the ancestors of present-day humans lived in relatively small tribes (usually with fewer than 150 people) where frequency information was more readily available.<ref name=Gaulin-6/>\n\n====Personality====\nEvolutionary psychology is primarily interested in finding commonalities between people, or basic human psychological nature. From an evolutionary perspective, the fact that people have fundamental differences in personality traits initially presents something of a puzzle.<ref name=Gaulin-9>Gaulin and McBurney 2003 Chapter 9.</ref> (Note: The field of behavioral genetics is concerned with statistically partitioning differences between people into genetic and environmental sources of variance. However, understanding the concept of [[heritability]] can be tricky \u2013 heritability refers only to the differences between people, never the degree to which the traits of an individual are due to environmental or genetic factors, since traits are always a complex interweaving of both.)\n\nPersonality traits are conceptualized by evolutionary psychologists as due to normal variation around an optimum, due to frequency-dependent selection (behavioral [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphisms]]), or as facultative adaptations. Like variability in height, some personality traits may simply reflect inter-individual variability around a general optimum.<ref name=Gaulin-9/> Or, personality traits may represent different genetically predisposed \"behavioral morphs\" \u2013 alternate behavioral strategies that depend on the frequency of competing behavioral strategies in the population. For example, if most of the population is generally trusting and gullible, the behavioral morph of being a \"cheater\" (or, in the extreme case, a sociopath) may be advantageous.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0140525X00039595 |title=The sociobiology of sociopathy: An integrated evolutionary model |year=2010 |last1=Mealey |first1=Linda |journal=[[Behavioral and Brain Sciences]] |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=523\u201341}}\n</ref> Finally, like many other psychological adaptations, personality traits may be facultative \u2013 sensitive to typical variations in the social environment, especially during early development. For example, later born children are more likely than first borns to be rebellious, less conscientious and more open to new experiences, which may be advantageous to them given their particular niche in family structure.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sulloway |first=F. |year=1996 |title=Born to rebel. |url=https://archive.org/details/borntorebelbirth00sull |url-access=registration |location=NY |publisher=Pantheon}}</ref> It is important to note that shared environmental influences do play a role in personality and are not always of less importance than genetic factors.

Pinker and [[Paul Bloom (psychologist)|Bloom]] (1990) argue that language as a mental faculty shares many likenesses with the complex organs of the body which suggests that, like these organs, language has evolved as an adaptation, since this is the only known mechanism by which such complex organs can develop.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pinker |first1=S. |last2=Bloom |first2=P. |year=1990 |title=Natural language and natural selection |journal=[[Behavioral and Brain Sciences]] |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=707\u201327 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X00081061 |citeseerx=10.1.1.116.4044 }}</ref>\n\nPinker follows Chomsky in arguing that the fact that children can learn any human language with no explicit instruction suggests that language, including most of grammar, is basically innate and that it only needs to be activated by interaction. Chomsky himself does not believe language to have evolved as an adaptation, but suggests that it likely evolved as a byproduct of some other adaptation, a so-called [[Spandrel (biology)|spandrel]]. But Pinker and Bloom argue that the organic nature of language strongly suggests that it has an adaptational origin.<ref>Workman, Lance and Will Reader (2004) Evolutionary psychology: an introduction.

Tomasello argues that studies of how children and primates actually acquire communicative skills suggests that humans learn complex behavior through experience, so that instead of a module specifically dedicated to language acquisition, language is acquired by the same cognitive mechanisms that are used to acquire all other kinds of socially transmitted behavior.<ref>Workman, Lance and Will Reader (2004) Evolutionary psychology: an introduction. Cambridge University Press p. 267</ref>\n\nOn the issue of whether language is best seen as having evolved as an adaptation or as a spandrel, evolutionary biologist [[W. Tecumseh Fitch]], following [[Stephen J. Gould]], argues that it is unwarranted to assume that every aspect of language is an adaptation, or that language as a whole is an adaptation. He criticizes some strands of evolutionary psychology for suggesting a pan-adaptionist view of evolution, and dismisses Pinker and Bloom's question of whether \"Language has evolved as an adaptation\" as being misleading. He argues instead that from a biological viewpoint the evolutionary origins of language is best conceptualized as being the probable result of a convergence of many separate adaptations into a complex system.<ref>W. Tecumseh Fitch (2010) The Evolution of Language. Cambridge University Press pp. 65\u201366</ref> A similar argument is made by [[Terrence Deacon]] who in ''[[The Symbolic Species]]'' argues that the different features of language have co-evolved with the evolution of the mind and that the ability to use symbolic communication is integrated in all other cognitive processes.<ref>Deacon, Terrence W. (1997) The Symbolic Species: The Co-evolution of Language and the Brain. W.W. Norton & Co</ref>\n\nIf the theory that language could have evolved as a single adaptation is accepted, the question becomes which of its many functions has been the basis of adaptation. Several evolutionary hypotheses have been posited: that language evolved for the purpose of social grooming, that it evolved as a way to show mating potential or that it evolved to form social contracts. Evolutionary psychologists recognize that these theories are all speculative and that much more evidence is required to understand how language might have been selectively adapted.<ref>Workman, Lance and Will Reader (2004) Evolutionary psychology: an introduction.

(1972). Parental investment and sexual selection. In B. Campbell (Ed.), ''Sexual Selection and the Descent of Man''. Chicago: Aldine-Atherton.</ref> on sex differences that is now referred to as [[Parental investment|parental investment theory]]. The size differences of [[gametes]] ([[anisogamy]]) is the fundamental, defining difference between males (small gametes \u2013 sperm) and females (large gametes \u2013 ova). Trivers noted that anisogamy typically results in different levels of parental investment between the sexes, with females initially investing more. Trivers proposed that this difference in parental investment leads to the [[sexual selection]] of different [[Human mating strategies|reproductive strategies]] between the sexes and to [[sexual conflict]]. For example, he suggested that the sex that invests less in offspring will generally compete for access to the higher-investing sex to increase their [[inclusive fitness]] (also see [[Bateman's principle]]<ref name=\"doi10.1038/hdy.1948.21\">{{Cite journal| first1 = A.

This particular pattern is predicted because the costs involved in mating for each sex are distinct. Women, on average, should prefer a mate who can offer resources (e.g., financial, commitment), thus, a woman risks losing such resources with a mate who commits emotional infidelity. Men, on the other hand, are never certain of the genetic paternity of their children because they do not bear the offspring themselves (\"paternity insecurity\"). This suggests that for men sexual infidelity would generally be more aversive than emotional infidelity because investing resources in another man's offspring does not lead to propagation of their own genes.<ref>Kalat, J.

These putative preferences are predicted to be especially apparent for short-term mating domains because a potential male mate would only be offering genes to a potential offspring. This hypothesis allows researchers to examine whether women select mates who have characteristics that indicate high genetic quality during the high fertility phase of their ovulatory cycles. Indeed, studies have shown that women's preferences vary across the ovulatory cycle. In particular, Haselton and Miller (2006) showed that highly fertile women prefer creative but poor men as short-term mates. Creativity may be a proxy for good genes.<ref>Miller, G. F. (2000b) ''The mating mind: How sexual choice shaped the evolution of human nature''. Anchor Books: New York.</ref> Research by Gangestad et al. (2004) indicates that highly fertile women prefer men who display social presence and intrasexual competition; these traits may act as cues that would help women predict which men may have, or would be able to acquire, resources.\n\n===Parenting===\n{{Main|Evolutionary psychology of parenting}}\n\nReproduction is always costly for women, and can also be for men. Individuals are limited in the degree to which they can devote time and resources to producing and raising their young, and such expenditure may also be detrimental to their future condition, survival and further reproductive output.\nParental investment is any parental expenditure (time, energy etc.) that benefits one [[offspring]] at a cost to parents' ability to invest in other components of fitness (Clutton-Brock 1991: 9; Trivers 1972). Components of fitness (Beatty 1992) include the well-being of existing offspring, parents' future [[sexual reproduction|reproduction]], and inclusive fitness through aid to kin ([[W. D. Hamilton|Hamilton]], 1964). Parental investment theory is a branch of life history theory.\n\nRobert Trivers' theory of parental investment predicts that the sex making the largest investment in [[lactation]], nurturing and protecting offspring will be more discriminating in mating and that the sex that invests less in offspring will compete for access to the higher investing sex (see [[Bateman's principle]]).<ref name=\"doi10.1038/hdy.1948.21\"/> Sex differences in parental effort are important in determining the strength of sexual selection.\n\nThe benefits of parental investment to the offspring are large and are associated with the effects on condition, growth, survival and ultimately, on reproductive success of the offspring. However, these benefits can come at the cost of parent's ability to reproduce in the future e.g. through the increased risk of injury when defending offspring against predators, the loss of mating opportunities whilst rearing offspring and an increase in the time to the next reproduction. Overall, parents are [[Selection (biology)|selected]] to maximize the difference between the benefits and the costs, and parental care will likely evolve when the benefits exceed the costs.\n\nThe [[Cinderella effect]] is an alleged high incidence of stepchildren being physically, emotionally or sexually abused, neglected, murdered, or otherwise mistreated at the hands of their stepparents at significantly higher rates than their genetic counterparts. It takes its name from the fairy tale character Cinderella, who in the story was cruelly mistreated by her stepmother and stepsisters.<ref>Daly, Matin, and Margo I. Wilson. (1999)</ref> Daly and Wilson (1996) noted: \"Evolutionary thinking led to the discovery of the most important risk factor for child homicide \u2013 the presence of a stepparent. Parental efforts and investments are valuable resources, and selection favors those parental psyches that allocate effort effectively to promote fitness. The adaptive problems that challenge parental decision making include both the accurate identification of one's offspring and the allocation of one's resources among them with sensitivity to their needs and abilities to convert parental investment into fitness increments\u2026. Stepchildren were seldom or never so valuable to one's expected fitness as one's own offspring would be, and those parental psyches that were easily parasitized by just any appealing youngster must always have incurred a selective disadvantage\"(Daly & Wilson, 1996, pp.&nbsp;64\u201365). However, they note that not all stepparents will \"want\" to abuse their partner's children, or that genetic parenthood is any insurance against abuse. They see step parental care as primarily \"mating effort\" towards the genetic parent.<ref name=Daly_Wilson_98>Daly & Wilson 1998</ref>\n\n===Family and kin===\n{{see also|Human inclusive fitness|Kin selection}}\nInclusive fitness is the sum of an organism's classical fitness (how many of its own offspring it produces and supports) and the number of equivalents of its own offspring it can add to the population by supporting others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.personalityresearch.org/evolutionary/inclusive.html|title=Evolutionary Psychology \u2013 Inclusive Fitness|accessdate=10 August 2016}}</ref> The first component is called classical fitness by Hamilton (1964).\n\nFrom the gene's point of view, evolutionary success ultimately depends on leaving behind the maximum number of copies of itself in the population. Until 1964, it was generally believed that genes only achieved this by causing the individual to leave the maximum number of viable offspring. However, in 1964 W. D. Hamilton proved mathematically that, because close relatives of an organism share some identical genes, a gene can also increase its evolutionary success by promoting the reproduction and survival of these related or otherwise similar individuals. Hamilton concluded that this leads natural selection to favor organisms that would behave in ways that maximize their inclusive fitness. It is also true that natural selection favors behavior that maximizes personal fitness.\n\nHamilton's rule describes mathematically whether or not a gene for altruistic behavior will spread in a population:\n:<math>rb > c \\ </math>\nwhere\n* <math>c \\ </math> is the reproductive cost to the altruist,\n* <math>b \\ </math> is the reproductive benefit to the recipient of the altruistic behavior, and\n* <math>r \\ </math> is the probability, above the population average, of the individuals sharing an altruistic gene \u2013 commonly viewed as \"degree of relatedness\".\n\nThe concept serves to explain how natural selection can perpetuate altruism. If there is an \"altruism gene\" (or complex of genes) that influences an organism's behavior to be helpful and protective of relatives and their offspring, this behavior also increases the proportion of the altruism gene in the population, because relatives are likely to share genes with the altruist due to [[identical by descent|common descent]]. Altruists may also have some way to recognize altruistic behavior in unrelated individuals and be inclined to support them. As Dawkins points out in ''The Selfish Gene'' (Chapter 6) and ''The Extended Phenotype'',<ref>Dawkins, Richard, \"The Extended Phenotype\", Oxford University Press 1982 (Chapter 9)</ref> this must be distinguished from the [[green-beard effect]].\n\nAlthough it is generally true that humans tend to be more altruistic toward their kin than toward non-kin, the relevant proximate mechanisms that mediate this cooperation have been debated (see [[kin recognition]]), with some arguing that kin status is determined primarily via social and cultural factors (such as co-residence, maternal association of sibs, etc.),<ref name=W2010>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2010.08.001 |title=Sixteen common misconceptions about the evolution of cooperation in humans |year=2011 |last1=West |first1=Stuart A. |last2=El Mouden |first2=Claire |last3=Gardner |first3=Andy |journal=Evolution and Human Behavior |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=231\u201362 |url=http://www.zoo.ox.ac.uk/group/west/pdf/WestElMoudenGardner_11.pdf |access-date=25 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812085608/http://www.zoo.ox.ac.uk/group/west/pdf/WestElMoudenGardner_11.pdf |archive-date=12 August 2017 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all |citeseerx=10.1.1.188.3318 }}</ref> while others have argued that kin recognition can also be mediated by biological factors such as facial resemblance and immunogenetic similarity of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC).<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2012.1279 | volume=279 | title=Social discrimination by quantitative assessment of immunogenetic similarity | year=2012 | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | pages=4368\u20134374 | last1 = Villinger | first1 = J.}}</ref> For a discussion of the interaction of these social and biological kin recognition factors see Lieberman, Tooby, and Cosmides (2007)<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lieberman | first1 = D. | last2 = Tooby | first2 = J. | last3 = Cosmides | first3 = L. | year = | title = The architecture of human kin detection | journal = Nature | volume = 445 | issue = | pages = 727\u201331 | doi = 10.1038/nature05510 | pmid = 17301784 | pmc = 3581061 | date = February 2007 }}</ref> ([https://web.archive.org/web/20120728071700/http://www.psych.ucsb.edu/research/cep/papers/kinnature05510.pdf PDF]).\n\nWhatever the proximate mechanisms of kin recognition there is substantial evidence that humans act generally more altruistically to close genetic kin compared to genetic non-kin.<ref name=ReferenceA>Buss, D.M.

Direct reciprocity can lead to the evolution of cooperation only if the probability, w, of another encounter between the same two individuals exceeds the cost-to-benefit ratio of the altruistic act:\n: w > c/b\n\nReciprocity can also be indirect if information about previous interactions is shared. Reputation allows evolution of cooperation by indirect reciprocity. Natural selection favors strategies that base the decision to help on the reputation of the recipient: studies show that people who are more helpful are more likely to receive help. The calculations of indirect reciprocity are complicated and only a tiny fraction of this universe has been uncovered, but again a simple rule has emerged.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=9634232 |year=1998 |last1=Nowak |first1=MA |last2=Sigmund |first2=K |title=Evolution of indirect reciprocity by image scoring |volume=393 |issue=6685 |pages=573\u201377 |doi=10.1038/31225 |journal=Nature |authorlink1=Martin Nowak |authorlink2=Karl Sigmund |bibcode=1998Natur.393..573N }}</ref> Indirect reciprocity can only promote cooperation if the probability, q, of knowing someone's reputation exceeds the cost-to-benefit ratio of the altruistic act:\n: q > c/b\n\nOne important problem with this explanation is that individuals may be able to evolve the capacity to obscure their reputation, reducing the probability, q, that it will be known.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature04201 |title=Human cooperation: Second-order free-riding problem solved? |last1=Fowler |first1=James H. |journal=Nature |volume=437 |issue=7058 |pages=E8; discussion E8\u20139 |authorlink1=James H.

Males are generally more aggressive than females, who are more selective of their partners because of the far greater effort they have to contribute to pregnancy and child-rearing. Males being more aggressive is hypothesized to stem from the more intense reproductive competition faced by them. Males of low status may be especially vulnerable to being childless. It may have been evolutionary advantageous to engage in highly risky and violently aggressive behavior to increase their status and therefore reproductive success. This may explain why males are generally involved in more crimes, and why low status and being unmarried is associated with criminality. Furthermore, competition over females is argued to have been particularly intensive in late adolescence and young adulthood, which is theorized to explain why crime rates are particularly high during this period.<ref name=AEP>Aurelio Jos\u00e9 Figueredo, Paul Robert Gladden, Zachary Hohman.

Therefore, it was important to be perceived as having a credible reputation for retaliation, resulting in humans to develop instincts for [[revenge]] as well as for protecting reputation (\"[[honor]]\"). Pinker argues that the development of the state and the police have dramatically reduced the level of violence compared to the ancestral environment. Whenever the state breaks down, which can be very locally such as in poor areas of a city, humans again organize in groups for protection and aggression and concepts such as violent revenge and protecting honor again become extremely important.<ref name=AEP/>\n\nRape is theorized to be a reproductive strategy that facilitates the propagation of the rapist's progeny. Such a strategy may be adopted by men who otherwise are unlikely to be appealing to women and therefore cannot form legitimate relationships, or by high status men on socially vulnerable women who are unlikely to retaliate to increase their reproductive success even further.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hagen|first1=Edward H.|title=Evolutionary Psychology FAQ|url=http://www.anth.ucsb.edu/projects/human/evpsychfaq.html|website=anth.ucsb.edu|accessdate=16 May 2016}}</ref> The [[sociobiological theories of rape]] are highly controversial, as traditional theories typically do not consider rape to be a behavioral adaptation, and objections to this theory are made on ethical, religious, political, as well as scientific grounds.\n\n===Psychology of religion===\n{{Main|Evolutionary psychology of religion}}\nAdaptationist perspectives on [[religious belief]] suggest that, like all behavior, religious behaviors are a product of the human brain. As with all other organ functions, [[cognition]]'s functional structure has been argued to have a genetic foundation, and is therefore subject to the effects of natural selection and sexual selection. Like other organs and tissues, this functional structure should be universally shared amongst humans and should have solved important problems of survival and reproduction in ancestral environments.

NY: Penguin</ref>{{page needed|date=April 2013}}<ref name=Levy/> However, their caution against committing the naturalistic fallacy has been criticized as means to stifle legitimate ethical discussions.<ref name=wilson2003/>\n\n===Contradictions in models===\nSome criticisms of evolutionary psychology point at contradictions between different aspects of adaptive scenarios posited by evolutionary psychology. One example is the evolutionary psychology model of extended social groups selecting for modern human brains, a contradiction being that the synaptic function of modern human brains require high amounts of many specific [[nutrient#Essentiality|essential nutrients]] so that such a transition to higher requirements of the same essential nutrients being shared by all individuals in a population would decrease the possibility of forming large groups due to bottleneck foods with rare essential nutrients capping group sizes. It is mentioned that some insects have societies with different ranks for each individual and that monkeys remain socially functioning after removal of most of the brain as additional arguments against big brains promoting social networking. The model of males as both providers and protectors is criticized for the impossibility of being in two places at once, the male cannot both protect his family at home and be out hunting at the same time. In the case of the claim that a provider male could buy protection service for his family from other males by [[barter]]ing food that he had hunted, critics point at the fact that the most valuable food (the food that contained the rarest essential nutrients) would be different in different ecologies and as such vegetable in some geographical areas and animal in others, making it impossible for hunting styles relying on physical strength or risk taking to be universally of similar value in bartered food and instead making it inevitable that in some parts of Africa, food gathered with no need for major physical strength would be the most valuable to barter for protection. A contradiction between evolutionary psychology's claim of men needing to be more sexually visual than women for fast speed of assessing women's fertility than women needed to be able to assess the male's genes and its claim of male sexual jealousy guarding against infidelity is also pointed at, as it would be pointless for a male to be fast to assess female fertility if he needed to assess the risk of there being a jealous male mate and in that case his chances of defeating him before mating anyway (pointlessness of assessing one necessary condition faster than another necessary condition can possibly be assessed).<ref>WE Frankenhuis Environmental unpredictability, Encyclopedia of Evolutionary Psychological Science, 2016 - Springer</ref><ref>Douglas T Kenrick, VIadas Griskevicius, Omar Mahmoud The rational animal: How evolution made us smarter than we think, 2016</ref>\n\n===Standard social science model===\n{{Main|Standard social science model}}\nEvolutionary psychology has been entangled in the larger philosophical and social science controversies related to the debate on [[nature versus nurture]].

The discipline is generally not focused on proximate analyses of behavior, but rather its focus is on the study of distal/ultimate causality (the evolution of psychological adaptations).

Alcock argues that present day evidence allows researchers to be reasonably confident about the conditions of the EEA and that the fact that so many human behaviours are adaptive in the ''current'' environment is evidence that the ancestral environment of humans had much in common with the present one, as these behaviours would have evolved in the ancestral environment. Thus Alcock concludes that researchers can make predictions on the adaptive value of traits.<ref>Maryanski, A., Machalek, R. and Turner, J.H., 2015.

Routledge. pp.161-163</ref> Similarly, Dominic Murphy argues that alternative explanations cannot just be forwarded but instead need their own evidence and predictions - if one explanation makes predictions that the others cannot, it is reasonable to have confidence in that explanation. In addition, Murphy argues that other historical sciences also make predictions about modern phenomena to come up with explanations about past phenomena, for example cosmologists look for evidence for what we would expect to see in the modern day if the Big Bang was true, while geologists make predictions about modern phenomena to determine if an asteroid wiped out the dinosaurs. Murphy argues that if other historical disciplines can conduct tests without a time machine, then the onus is on the critics to show why evolutionary psychology is untestable if other historical disciplines are not, as \"methods should be judged across the board, not singled out for ridicule in one context.\"<ref name=\"Murphy, Dominic pp. 161-184\"/>\n\n===Modularity of mind===\n{{Main|Modularity of mind}}\nEvolutionary psychologists generally presume that, like the body, the mind is made up of many evolved modular adaptations,<ref name=Kurzban-R-2011>{{cite book |last=Kurzban |first=Robert |year=2011 |title=Why Everyone (Else) Is a Hypocrite: Evolution and the Modular Mind |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=NJ |isbn=9780691146744}}</ref> although there is some disagreement within the discipline regarding the degree of general plasticity, or \"generality,\" of some modules.<ref name=AmPs2010>{{Cite journal | last1 = Confer | first1 = J.

[[Adaptationist]] thinking about physiological mechanisms, such as the heart, lungs, and immune system, is common in [[evolutionary biology]]. Some evolutionary psychologists apply the same thinking to psychology, arguing that the [[modularity of mind]] is similar to that of the body and with different modular adaptations serving different functions. Evolutionary psychologists argue that much of human behavior is the output of [[psychological adaptation]]s that evolved to solve recurrent problems in human ancestral environments.<ref>Confer et al. 2010; Buss, 2005; Durrant & Ellis, 2003; Pinker, 2002; Tooby & Cosmides, 2005</ref>\n\nEvolutionary psychology is not simply a subdiscipline of psychology but its evolutionary theory can provide a foundational, [[Metatheory|metatheoretical]] framework that integrates the entire field of psychology in the same way evolutionary biology has for biology.<ref name=Cosmides/><ref>Duntley and Buss 2008</ref><ref>Carmen, R.A., et al.

Proponents suggest that it seeks to integrate psychology into the other natural sciences, rooting it in the organizing theory of biology ([[evolutionary theory]]), and thus understanding [[psychology]] as a branch of [[biology]]. Anthropologist [[John Tooby]] and psychologist [[Leda Cosmides]] note:\n\n<blockquote>Evolutionary psychology is the long-forestalled scientific attempt to assemble out of the disjointed, fragmentary, and mutually contradictory human disciplines a single, logically integrated research framework for the psychological, social, and behavioral sciences \u2013 a framework\nthat not only incorporates the evolutionary sciences on a full and equal basis, but that systematically works out all of the revisions in existing belief and research practice that such a synthesis requires.<ref>Tooby & Cosmides 2005, p. 5</ref></blockquote>\n\nJust as human [[physiology]] and [[evolutionary physiology]] have worked to identify physical adaptations of the body that represent \"human physiological nature,\" the purpose of evolutionary psychology is to identify evolved emotional and cognitive adaptations that represent \"human psychological nature.\" According to [[Steven Pinker]], it is \"not a single theory but a large set of hypotheses\" and a term that \"has also come to refer to a particular way of applying evolutionary theory to the mind, with an emphasis on adaptation, gene-level selection, and modularity.\" Evolutionary psychology adopts an understanding of the mind that is based on the [[computational theory of mind]]. It describes mental processes as computational operations, so that, for example, a fear response is described as arising from a neurological computation that inputs the perceptional data, e.g. a visual image of a spider, and outputs the appropriate reaction, e.g. fear of possibly dangerous animals. Under this view, any [[Domain-general learning]] is impossible because of the [[Combinatorial explosion]]. This implies [[Domain-specific learning]]. Evolutionary Psychology specifies the domain as the problems of survival and reproduction.<ref>Buss, David M. \"Evolutionary Psychology: The New Science of The Mind\" 5th edition. pages 28-29.</ref>\n\nWhile philosophers have generally considered the human mind to include broad faculties, such as reason and lust, evolutionary psychologists describe evolved psychological mechanisms as narrowly focused to deal with specific issues, such as catching cheaters or choosing mates. The discipline views the [[human brain]] as comprising many functional mechanisms,{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} called ''psychological adaptations'' or evolved cognitive mechanisms or ''[[cognitive modules]]'', designed by the process of natural selection. Examples include [[language acquisition|language-acquisition modules]], [[Westermarck effect|incest-avoidance mechanisms]], [[Wason selection task|cheater-detection mechanisms]], intelligence and sex-specific mating preferences, foraging mechanisms, alliance-tracking mechanisms, agent-detection mechanisms, and others. Some mechanisms, termed ''domain-specific'', deal with recurrent adaptive problems over the course of human evolutionary history.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} ''Domain-general'' mechanisms, on the other hand, are proposed to deal with evolutionary novelty.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nEvolutionary psychology has roots in [[cognitive psychology]] and evolutionary biology but also draws on [[behavioral ecology]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[genetics]], [[ethology]], [[anthropology]], [[archaeology]], biology, and [[zoology]]. It is closely linked to [[sociobiology]],<ref name=Psychology/> but there are key differences between them including the emphasis on ''domain-specific'' rather than ''domain-general'' mechanisms, the relevance of measures of current [[fitness (biology)|fitness]], the importance of [[mismatch theory]], and psychology rather than behavior.

In 1975, [[E.O. Wilson|Edward O. Wilson]] combined evolutionary theory with studies of animal and social behavior, building on the works of Lorenz and Tinbergen, in his book ''[[Sociobiology: The New Synthesis]]''.\n\nIn the 1970s, two major branches developed from ethology. Firstly, the study of animal ''social'' behavior (including humans) generated [[sociobiology]], defined by its pre-eminent proponent Edward O. Wilson in 1975 as \"the systematic study of the biological basis of all social behavior\"<ref>Wilson, Edward O. 1975.[http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog/WILSOR.html ''Sociobiology: The New Synthesis''.] Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Ma. {{ISBN|0-674-00089-7}} p. 4.</ref> and in 1978 as \"the extension of population biology and evolutionary theory to social organization.\"<ref>Wilson, Edward O. 1978. ''On Human Nature''. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Ma. p. x.</ref> Secondly, there was behavioral ecology which placed less emphasis on ''social'' behavior; it focused on the ecological and evolutionary basis of animal and [[human behavioral ecology|human]] behavior.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s university departments began to include the term ''evolutionary biology'' in their titles. The modern era of evolutionary psychology was ushered in, in particular, by [[Donald Symons]]' 1979 book ''[[The Evolution of Human Sexuality]]'' and [[Leda Cosmides]] and [[John Tooby]]'s 1992 book ''[[The Adapted Mind]]''.<ref name=Psychology/> David Buller observed that the term \"evolutionary psychology\" is sometimes seen as denoting research based on the specific methodological and theoretical commitments of certain researchers from the Santa Barbara school (University of California), thus some evolutionary psychologists prefer to term their work \"human ecology\", \"human behavioural ecology\" or \"evolutionary anthropology\" instead.<ref>Buller, David J. Adapting minds: Evolutionary psychology and the persistent quest for human nature. MIT press, 2006, p.8</ref>\n\nFrom psychology there are the primary streams of [[developmental psychology|developmental]], [[social psychology|social]] and cognitive psychology. Establishing some measure of the relative influence of genetics and environment on behavior has been at the core of [[Behavioural genetics|behavioral genetics]] and its variants, notably studies at the molecular level that examine the relationship between genes, neurotransmitters and behavior. [[Dual inheritance theory]] (DIT), developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s, has a slightly different perspective by trying to explain how [[human behavior]] is a product of two different and interacting evolutionary processes: [[genetic evolution]] and [[cultural evolution]]. DIT is seen by some as a \"middle-ground\" between views that emphasize human universals versus those that emphasize cultural variation.<ref>Laland, Kevin N. and Gillian R. Brown. 2002. ''Sense & Nonsense: Evolutionary Perspectives on Human Behavior.'' Oxford University Press, Oxford. pp. 287\u2013319.</ref>\n\n==Theoretical foundations==\n{{Main|Theoretical foundations of evolutionary psychology}}\nThe theories on which evolutionary psychology is based originated with Charles Darwin's work, including his speculations about the evolutionary origins of social instincts in humans. Modern evolutionary psychology, however, is possible only because of advances in evolutionary theory in the 20th century.\n\nEvolutionary psychologists say that natural selection has provided humans with many psychological adaptations, in much the same way that it generated humans' anatomical and physiological adaptations.<ref name=Gaulin-Steven-J-C-2003-pp.25-56>Gaulin and McBurney 2003 pp. 25\u201356.</ref> As with adaptations in general, psychological adaptations are said to be specialized for the environment in which an organism evolved, the environment of evolutionary adaptedness.<ref name=Gaulin-Steven-J-C-2003-pp.25-56/><ref name=Economics-2003>See also \"Environment of evolutionary adaptation,\" a variation of the term used in Economics, e.g., in {{cite journal | last1 = Rubin | first1 = Paul H | year = 2003 | title = Folk economics | journal = Southern Economic Journal | volume = 70 | issue = 1| pages = 157\u201371 | doi=10.2307/1061637| jstor = 1061637 }}</ref> Sexual selection provides organisms with adaptations related to mating.<ref name=Gaulin-Steven-J-C-2003-pp.25-56/> For male [[mammal]]s, which have a relatively high maximal potential reproduction rate, sexual selection leads to adaptations that help them compete for females.<ref name=Gaulin-Steven-J-C-2003-pp.25-56/> For female mammals, with a relatively low maximal potential reproduction rate, sexual selection leads to choosiness, which helps females select higher quality mates.<ref name=Gaulin-Steven-J-C-2003-pp.25-56/> Charles Darwin described both natural selection and sexual selection, and he relied on group selection to explain the evolution of [[Altruism|altruistic]] (self-sacrificing) behavior. But group selection was considered a weak explanation, because in any group the less altruistic individuals will be more likely to survive, and the group will become less self-sacrificing as a whole.\n\nIn 1964, [[W. D. Hamilton|William D. Hamilton]] proposed [[inclusive fitness]] theory, emphasizing a [[gene-centered view of evolution]]. Hamilton noted that genes can increase the replication of copies of themselves into the next generation by influencing the organism's social traits in such a way that (statistically) results in helping the survival and reproduction of other copies of the same genes (most simply, identical copies in the organism's close relatives). According to [[Hamilton's rule]], self-sacrificing behaviors (and the genes influencing them) can evolve if they typically help the organism's close relatives so much that it more than compensates for the individual animal's sacrifice. Inclusive fitness theory resolved the issue of how altruism can evolve. Other theories also help explain the evolution of altruistic behavior, including [[evolutionary game theory]], [[tit-for-tat]] reciprocity, and generalized reciprocity. These theories help to explain the development of altruistic behavior, and account for hostility toward cheaters (individuals that take advantage of others' altruism).<ref name=moralanimal/>\n\nSeveral mid-level evolutionary theories inform evolutionary psychology. The [[r/K selection]] theory proposes that some species prosper by having many offspring, while others follow the strategy of having fewer offspring but investing much more in each one. Humans follow the second strategy. Parental investment theory explains how parents invest more or less in individual offspring based on how successful those offspring are likely to be, and thus how much they might improve the parents' inclusive fitness. According to the [[Trivers\u2013Willard hypothesis]], parents in good conditions tend to invest more in sons (who are best able to take advantage of good conditions), while parents in poor conditions tend to invest more in daughters (who are best able to have successful offspring even in poor conditions). According to [[life history theory]], animals evolve life histories to match their environments, determining details such as age at first reproduction and number of offspring. Dual inheritance theory posits that genes and human culture have interacted, with genes affecting the development of culture, and culture, in turn, affecting human evolution on a genetic level (see also the [[Baldwin effect]]).\n\n==Evolved psychological mechanisms==\n{{Main|psychological adaptation|l1=Evolved psychological mechanisms}}\nEvolutionary psychology is based on the hypothesis that, just like hearts, lungs, livers, kidneys, and immune systems, cognition has functional structure that has a genetic basis, and therefore has evolved by natural selection. Like other organs and tissues, this functional structure should be universally shared amongst a species, and should solve important problems of survival and [[reproduction]].\n\nEvolutionary psychologists seek to understand psychological mechanisms by understanding the survival and reproductive functions they might have served over the course of evolutionary history.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} These might include abilities to infer others' emotions, discern kin from non-kin, identify and prefer healthier mates, cooperate with others and follow leaders. Consistent with the theory of natural selection, evolutionary psychology sees humans as often in conflict with others, including mates and relatives. For instance, a mother may wish to wean her offspring from breastfeeding earlier than does her infant, which frees up the mother to invest in additional offspring.<ref name=moralanimal/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://scilib-biology.narod.ru/MoralAnimal/index_en.html |title=The Moral Animal: Why We Are The Way We Are: The New Science of Evolutionary Psychology |accessdate=15 October 2013 |first=Robert |last=Wright}}</ref> Evolutionary psychology also recognizes the role of kin selection and reciprocity in evolving prosocial traits such as altruism.<ref name=moralanimal/> Like [[common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]s and [[bonobo]]s, humans have subtle and flexible social instincts, allowing them to form extended families, lifelong friendships, and political alliances.<ref name=moralanimal/> In studies testing theoretical predictions, evolutionary psychologists have made modest findings on topics such as infanticide, intelligence, marriage patterns, promiscuity, perception of beauty, bride price and parental investment.<ref name=social-behavior/>\n\n===Historical topics===\nProponents of evolutionary psychology in the 1990s made some explorations in historical events, but the response from historical experts was highly negative and there has been little effort to continue that line of research. Historian [[Lynn Hunt]] says that the historians complained that the researchers:\n:have read the wrong studies, misinterpreted the results of experiments, or worse yet, turned to neuroscience looking for a universalizing, anti-representational and anti-intentional ontology to bolster their claims.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hunt | first1 = Lynn | year = 2014 | title = The Self and Its History | url = | journal = American Historical Review | volume = 119 | issue = 5| pages = 1576\u201386 | doi=10.1093/ahr/119.5.1576}} quote p 1576.</ref>\n\nHunt states that, \"the few attempts to build up a subfield of psychohistory collapsed under the weight of its presuppositions.\" She concludes that as of 2014 the \"'iron curtain' between historians and psychology...remains standing.\"<ref>Hunt, \"The Self and Its History.\" p. 1578.</ref>\n\n===Products of evolution: adaptations, exaptations, byproducts, and random variation===\nNot all traits of organisms are evolutionary adaptations. As noted in the table below, traits may also be [[exaptation]]s, byproducts of adaptations (sometimes called \"spandrels\"), or random variation between individuals.<ref>Buss et al. 1998</ref>\n\nPsychological adaptations are hypothesized to be innate or relatively easy to learn, and to manifest in cultures worldwide. For example, the ability of toddlers to learn a language with virtually no training is likely to be a psychological adaptation. On the other hand, ancestral humans did not read or write, thus today, learning to read and write require extensive training, and presumably involves the repurposing of cognitive capacities that evolved in response to selection pressures unrelated to written language.<ref>Pinker, Steven. (1994) The Language Instinct</ref> However, variations in manifest behavior can result from universal mechanisms interacting with different local environments. For example, Caucasians who move from a northern climate to the equator will have darker skin. The mechanisms regulating their pigmentation do not change; rather the input to those mechanisms change, resulting in different output.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! !! Adaptation !! Exaptation !!

[[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]] suggested that an \"adaptation is a special and onerous concept that should only be used where it is really necessary.\"<ref>George C Williams, ''Adaptation and Natural Selection''. p. 4.</ref> As noted by Williams and others, adaptations can be identified by their improbable complexity, species universality, and adaptive functionality.\n\n===Obligate and facultative adaptations===\nA question that may be asked about an adaptation is whether it is generally obligate (relatively robust in the face of typical environmental variation) or facultative (sensitive to typical environmental variation).<ref name=Buss-D-M-2011>Buss, D. M. (2011). Evolutionary psychology.</ref> The sweet taste of sugar and the pain of hitting one's knee against concrete are the result of fairly obligate psychological adaptations; typical environmental variability during development does not much affect their operation. By contrast, facultative adaptations are somewhat like \"if-then\" statements. For example, adult attachment style seems particularly sensitive to early childhood experiences. As adults, the propensity to develop close, trusting bonds with others is dependent on whether early childhood caregivers could be trusted to provide reliable assistance and attention. The adaptation for skin to tan is conditional to exposure to sunlight; this is an example of another facultative adaptation. When a psychological adaptation is facultative, evolutionary psychologists concern themselves with how developmental and environmental inputs influence the expression of the adaptation.\n\n===Cultural universals===\n{{main|Cultural universal}}\nEvolutionary psychologists hold that behaviors or traits that occur universally in all cultures are good candidates for evolutionary adaptations.<ref name=Psychology/> Cultural universals include behaviors related to language, cognition, social roles, gender roles, and technology.<ref>[[Donald E. Brown|Brown, Donald E.]] (1991) Human Universals. New York: McGraw-Hill.</ref> Evolved psychological adaptations (such as the ability to learn a language) interact with cultural inputs to produce specific behaviors (e.g., the specific language learned). \n\nBasic gender differences, such as greater eagerness for sex among men and greater coyness among women,<ref>Symons, D. (1979). The evolution of human sexuality. Oxford: Oxford University Press. Chapter 6.</ref> are explained as sexually dimorphic psychological adaptations that reflect the different reproductive strategies of males and females.<ref name=\"moralanimal\" /><ref name=\"BS\">Pinker 2002</ref> Research has also shown participants were able to recognize the facial expression of fear significantly better on a male face than on a female face.

That environment is often referred to as the \"environment of evolutionary adaptedness\".<ref name=Economics-2003/>\n\nThe idea of an ''environment of evolutionary adaptedness'' was first explored as a part of [[attachment theory]] by [[John Bowlby]].<ref name=Bowlby1969>{{cite book |last=Bowlby |first=John |title=Attachment |url=https://archive.org/details/attachment01bowl |url-access=registration |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |year=1969}}</ref> This is the environment to which a particular evolved mechanism is adapted. More specifically, the environment of evolutionary adaptedness is defined as the set of historically recurring selection pressures that formed a given adaptation, as well as those aspects of the environment that were necessary for the proper development and functioning of the adaptation.\n\nHumans, comprising the genus ''[[Homo (genus)|Homo]]'', appeared between 1.5 and 2.5 million years ago, a time that roughly coincides with the start of the [[Pleistocene]] 2.6 million years ago. Because the Pleistocene ended a mere 12,000 years ago, most human adaptations either newly evolved during the Pleistocene, or were maintained by [[stabilizing selection]] during the Pleistocene. Evolutionary psychology therefore proposes that the majority of human psychological mechanisms are adapted to reproductive problems frequently encountered in Pleistocene environments.<ref name=Symons1992>{{cite book |last=Symons |first=Donald |authorlink=Donald Symons |chapter=On the use and misuse of Darwinism in the study of human behavior |title=The Adapted Mind: Evolutionary psychology and the generation of culture |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1992 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/adaptedmindevolu0000unse/page/137 137\u201359] |isbn=978-0-19-510107-2 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/adaptedmindevolu0000unse/page/137 }}</ref> In broad terms, these problems include those of growth, development, differentiation, maintenance, mating, parenting, and social relationships.\n\nThe environment of evolutionary adaptedness is significantly different from modern society.<ref name=EBO-social/> The ancestors of modern humans lived in smaller groups, had more cohesive cultures, and had more stable and rich contexts for identity and meaning.<ref name=EBO-social>\"social behaviour, animal.\" Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.

[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/550897/animal-social-behaviour].</ref> Researchers look to existing hunter-gatherer societies for clues as to how hunter-gatherers lived in the environment of evolutionary adaptedness.<ref name=moralanimal/> Unfortunately, the few surviving hunter-gatherer societies are different from each other, and they have been pushed out of the best land and into harsh environments, so it is not clear how closely they reflect ancestral culture.<ref name=moralanimal/> However, all around the world small-band hunter-gatherers offer a similar developmental system for the young (\"hunter-gatherer childhood model,\" Konner, 2005; \n\"evolved developmental niche\" or \"evolved nest;\" Narvaez et al., 2013). The characteristics of the niche are largely the same as for social mammals, who evolved over 30 million years ago: soothing perinatal experience, several years of on-request breastfeeding, nearly constant affection or physical proximity, responsiveness to need (mitigating offspring distress), self-directed play, and for humans, multiple responsive caregivers. Initial studies show the importance of these components in early life for positive child outcomes.{{sfn|Narvaez|Gleason|Wang|Brooks|2013}}{{sfn|Narvaez| Wang|Gleason|Cheng|2012}}\n\nEvolutionary psychologists sometimes look to chimpanzees, bonobos, and other great apes for insight into human ancestral behavior.<ref name=moralanimal>Wright 1995</ref>\n\n===Mismatches===\n\nSince an organism's adaptations were suited to its ancestral environment, a new and different environment can create a mismatch. Because humans are mostly adapted to [[Pleistocene]] environments, psychological mechanisms sometimes exhibit \"mismatches\" to the modern environment. One example is the fact that although about 10,000 people are killed with guns in the US annually,<ref>[https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr54/nvsr54_10.pdf CDC pdf]</ref> whereas spiders and snakes kill only a handful, people nonetheless learn to fear spiders and snakes about as easily as they do a pointed gun, and more easily than an unpointed gun, rabbits or flowers.<ref name=Ohman2001>{{cite journal |last1=Ohman |first1=A. |last2=Mineka |first2=S. |year=2001 |title=Fears, phobias, and preparedness: Toward an evolved module of fear and fear learning |journal=Psychological Review |volume=108 |issue=3 |pages=483\u2013522 |url=http://instruct.uwo.ca/psychology/371g/Ohman2001.pdf |accessdate=16 June 2008 |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.108.3.483 |pmid=11488376}}</ref> A potential explanation is that spiders and snakes were a threat to human ancestors throughout the Pleistocene, whereas guns (and rabbits and flowers) were not.

The term was coined by [[Niko Tinbergen]] to refer to non-human animal behavior, but psychologist [[Deirdre Barrett]] said that supernormal stimulation governs the behavior of humans as powerfully as that of other animals. She explained junk food as an exaggerated stimulus to cravings for salt, sugar, and fats,<ref>Barrett, Deirdre. Waistland: The R/Evolutionary Science Behind Our Weight and Fitness Crisis (2007). New York: W.W. Norton. pp. 31\u201351.</ref> and she says that television is an exaggeration of social cues of laughter, smiling faces and attention-grabbing action.<ref>Barrett, Deirdre.

Naturally Selected: The Evolutionary Science of Leadership (2011). New York: Harper Business.</ref> His argument is that humans are not adapted to work in large, anonymous bureaucratic structures with formal hierarchies. The human mind still responds to personalized, charismatic leadership primarily in the context of informal, egalitarian settings. Hence the dissatisfaction and alienation that many employees experience. Salaries, bonuses and other privileges exploit instincts for relative status, which attract particularly males to senior executive positions.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Van Vugt |first1=Mark |last2=Ronay |first2=Richard |year=2014 |title=The Evolutionary Psychology of Leadership |url=|journal=Organizational Psychology Review |volume=4 |issue=|pages=74\u201395 |doi=10.1177/2041386613493635}}</ref>\n\n==Research methods==\nEvolutionary theory is [[heuristic]] in that it may generate hypotheses that might not be developed from other theoretical approaches. One of the major goals of adaptationist research is to identify which organismic traits are likely to be adaptations, and which are byproducts or random variations. As noted earlier, adaptations are expected to show evidence of complexity, functionality, and species universality, while byproducts or random variation will not. In addition, adaptations are expected to manifest as proximate mechanisms that interact with the environment in either a generally obligate or facultative fashion (see above). Evolutionary psychologists are also interested in identifying these proximate mechanisms (sometimes termed \"mental mechanisms\" or \"psychological adaptations\") and what type of information they take as input, how they process that information, and their outputs.<ref name=Buss-D-M-2011/> [[Evolutionary developmental psychology]], or \"evo-devo,\" focuses on how adaptations may be activated at certain developmental times (e.g., losing baby teeth, adolescence, etc.) or how events during the development of an individual may alter life history trajectories.\n\nEvolutionary psychologists use several strategies to develop and test hypotheses about whether a psychological trait is likely to be an evolved adaptation. Buss (2011)<ref>Buss, D.M. (2011). Evolutionary psychology. Chapter 2. Boston: Pearson/A and B.</ref> notes that these methods include:\n\n:''Cross-cultural Consistency.'' Characteristics that have been demonstrated to be cross cultural [[human universals]] such as smiling, crying, facial expressions are presumed to be evolved psychological adaptations. Several evolutionary psychologists have collected massive datasets from cultures around the world to assess cross-cultural universality.\n\n:''Function to Form (or \"problem to solution\").'' The fact that males, but not females, risk potential misidentification of genetic offspring (referred to as \"paternity insecurity\") led evolutionary psychologists to hypothesize that, compared to females, male jealousy would be more focused on sexual, rather than emotional, infidelity.\n\n:''Form to Function (reverse-engineering \u2013 or \"solution to problem\").'' [[Morning sickness]], and associated aversions to certain types of food, during pregnancy seemed to have the characteristics of an evolved adaptation (complexity and universality). [[Margie Profet]] hypothesized that the function was to avoid the ingestion of toxins during early pregnancy that could damage fetus (but which are otherwise likely to be harmless to healthy non-pregnant women).\n\n:''Corresponding Neurological Modules.'' Evolutionary psychology and cognitive neuropsychology are mutually compatible \u2013 evolutionary psychology helps to identify psychological adaptations and their ultimate, evolutionary functions, while neuropsychology helps to identify the proximate manifestations of these adaptations.\n\n:''Current evolutionary Adaptiveness.'' In addition to evolutionary models that suggest evolution occurs across large spans of time, recent research has demonstrated that some evolutionary shifts can be fast and dramatic. Consequently, some evolutionary psychologists have focused on the impact of psychological traits in the current environment. Such research can be used to inform estimates of the prevalence of traits over time. Such work has been informative in studying evolutionary psychopathology.<ref>Jacobson, N.C. (2016).

Baars]].<ref>Baars, Bernard J. ''A Cognitive Theory of Consciousness.'' 1993. Cambridge University Press.</ref> [[Richard Dawkins]] suggested that humans evolved consciousness in order to make themselves the subjects of thought.<ref name=Gaulin-5/> Daniel Povinelli suggests that large, tree-climbing apes evolved consciousness to take into account one's own mass when moving safely among tree branches.<ref name=Gaulin-5/> Consistent with this hypothesis, [[Gordon Gallup]] found that chimps and orangutans, but not little monkeys or terrestrial gorillas, demonstrated self-awareness in mirror tests.<ref name=Gaulin-5/>\n\nThe concept of consciousness can refer to voluntary action, awareness, or wakefulness. However, even voluntary behavior involves unconscious mechanisms. Many cognitive processes take place in the cognitive unconscious, unavailable to conscious awareness. Some behaviors are conscious when learned but then become unconscious, seemingly automatic. Learning, especially implicitly learning a skill, can take place outside of consciousness. For example, plenty of people know how to turn right when they ride a bike, but very few can accurately explain how they actually do so. Evolutionary psychology approaches self-deception as an adaptation that can improve one's results in social exchanges.<ref name=Gaulin-5/>\n\nSleep may have evolved to conserve energy when activity would be less fruitful or more dangerous, such as at night, and especially during the winter season.<ref name=Gaulin-5>Gaulin and McBurney 2003 p. 101\u201321.</ref>\n\n====Sensation and perception====\n{{See also|Sensation (psychology)|perception}}\n\nMany experts, such as [[Jerry Fodor]], write that the purpose of perception is knowledge, but evolutionary psychologists hold that its primary purpose is to guide action.<ref name=Gaulin-4/> For example, they say, [[depth perception]] seems to have evolved not to help us know the distances to other objects but rather to help us move around in space.<ref name=Gaulin-4/> Evolutionary psychologists say that animals from fiddler crabs to humans use eyesight for collision avoidance, suggesting that vision is basically for directing action, not providing knowledge.<ref name=Gaulin-4>Gaulin and McBurney 2003 pp. 81\u2013101.</ref>\n\nBuilding and maintaining sense organs is metabolically expensive, so these organs evolve only when they improve an organism's fitness.<ref name=Gaulin-4/> More than half the brain is devoted to processing sensory information, and the brain itself consumes roughly one-fourth of one's metabolic resources, so the senses must provide exceptional benefits to fitness.<ref name=Gaulin-4/> Perception accurately mirrors the world; animals get useful, accurate information through their senses.<ref name=Gaulin-4/>\n\nScientists who study perception and sensation have long understood the human senses as adaptations to their surrounding worlds.<ref name=Gaulin-4/> Depth perception consists of processing over half a dozen visual cues, each of which is based on a regularity of the physical world.<ref name=Gaulin-4/> Vision evolved to respond to the narrow range of electromagnetic energy that is plentiful and that does not pass through objects.<ref name=Gaulin-4/> Sound waves go around corners and interact with obstacles, creating a complex pattern that includes useful information about the sources of and distances to objects.<ref name=Gaulin-4/> Larger animals naturally make lower-pitched sounds as a consequence of their size.<ref name=Gaulin-4/> The range over which an animal hears, on the other hand, is determined by adaptation. Homing pigeons, for example, can hear very low-pitched sound (infrasound) that carries great distances, even though most smaller animals detect higher-pitched sounds.<ref name=Gaulin-4/> Taste and smell respond to chemicals in the environment that are thought to have been significant for fitness in the environment of evolutionary adaptedness.<ref name=Gaulin-4/> For example, salt and sugar were apparently both valuable to the human or pre-human inhabitants of the environment of evolutionary adaptedness, so present day humans have an intrinsic hunger for salty and sweet tastes.<ref name=Gaulin-4/> The sense of touch is actually many senses, including pressure, heat, cold, tickle, and pain.<ref name=Gaulin-4/> Pain, while unpleasant, is adaptive.<ref name=Gaulin-4/> An important adaptation for senses is range shifting, by which the organism becomes temporarily more or less sensitive to sensation.<ref name=Gaulin-4/> For example, one's eyes automatically adjust to dim or bright ambient light.<ref name=Gaulin-4/> Sensory abilities of different organisms often coevolve, as is the case with the hearing of echolocating bats and that of the moths that have evolved to respond to the sounds that the bats make.<ref name=Gaulin-4/>\n\nEvolutionary psychologists contend that perception demonstrates the principle of modularity, with specialized mechanisms handling particular perception tasks.<ref name=Gaulin-4/> For example, people with damage to a particular part of the brain suffer from the specific defect of not being able to recognize faces (prosopagnosia).<ref name=Gaulin-4/> Evolutionary psychology suggests that this indicates a so-called face-reading module.<ref name=Gaulin-4/>\n\n====Learning and facultative adaptations====\nIn evolutionary psychology, learning is said to be accomplished through evolved capacities, specifically facultative adaptations.<ref name=LearningG8>Gaulin and McBurney 2003 Chapter 8.</ref> Facultative adaptations express themselves differently depending on input from the environment.<ref name=LearningG8/> Sometimes the input comes during development and helps shape that development.<ref name=LearningG8/> For example, migrating birds learn to orient themselves by the stars during a critical period in their maturation.<ref name=LearningG8/> Evolutionary psychologists believe that humans also learn language along an evolved program, also with critical periods.<ref name=LearningG8/> The input can also come during daily tasks, helping the organism cope with changing environmental conditions.<ref name=LearningG8/> For example, animals evolved Pavlovian conditioning in order to solve problems about causal relationships.<ref name=LearningG8/> Animals accomplish learning tasks most easily when those tasks resemble problems that they faced in their evolutionary past, such as a rat learning where to find food or water.<ref name=LearningG8/> Learning capacities sometimes demonstrate differences between the sexes.<ref name=LearningG8/> In many animal species, for example, males can solve spatial problem faster and more accurately than females, due to the effects of male hormones during development.<ref name=LearningG8/> The same might be true of humans.<ref name=LearningG8/>\n\n====Emotion and motivation====\n{{Main|Evolution of emotion}}\nMotivations direct and energize behavior, while emotions provide the affective component to motivation, positive or negative.<ref name=Gaulin-6>Gaulin and McBurney 2003 pp. 121\u201342.</ref> In the early 1970s, [[Paul Ekman]] and colleagues began a line of research which suggests that many emotions are universal.<ref name=Gaulin-6/> He found evidence that humans share at least five basic emotions: fear, sadness, happiness, anger, and disgust.<ref name=Gaulin-6/> Social emotions evidently evolved to motivate social behaviors that were adaptive in the environment of evolutionary adaptedness.<ref name=Gaulin-6/> For example, spite seems to work against the individual but it can establish an individual's reputation as someone to be feared.<ref name=Gaulin-6/> Shame and pride can motivate behaviors that help one maintain one's standing in a community, and self-esteem is one's estimate of one's status.<ref name=moralanimal/><ref name=Gaulin-6/>\nMotivation has a neurobiological basis in the [[reward system]] of the brain. Recently, it has been suggested that reward systems may evolve in such a way that there may be an [[inherent]] or unavoidable [[trade-off]] in the motivational system for activities of short versus long duration.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Belke | first1 = T.

From an evolutionary psychology perspective, cognition is not \"general purpose,\" but uses heuristics, or strategies, that generally increase the likelihood of solving problems that the ancestors of present-day humans routinely faced. For example, present day humans are far more likely to solve logic problems that involve detecting cheating (a common problem given humans' social nature) than the same logic problem put in purely abstract terms.<ref name=Gaulin-7>Gaulin and McBurney 2003 Chapter 7.</ref> Since the ancestors of present-day humans did not encounter truly random events, present day humans may be cognitively predisposed to incorrectly identify patterns in random sequences. \"Gamblers' Fallacy\" is one example of this. Gamblers may falsely believe that they have hit a \"lucky streak\" even when each outcome is actually random and independent of previous trials. Most people believe that if a fair coin has been flipped 9 times and Heads appears each time, that on the tenth flip, there is a greater than 50% chance of getting Tails.<ref name=Gaulin-6/> Humans find it far easier to make diagnoses or predictions using frequency data than when the same information is presented as probabilities or percentages, presumably because the ancestors of present-day humans lived in relatively small tribes (usually with fewer than 150 people) where frequency information was more readily available.<ref name=Gaulin-6/>\n\n====Personality====\nEvolutionary psychology is primarily interested in finding commonalities between people, or basic human psychological nature. From an evolutionary perspective, the fact that people have fundamental differences in personality traits initially presents something of a puzzle.<ref name=Gaulin-9>Gaulin and McBurney 2003 Chapter 9.</ref> (Note: The field of behavioral genetics is concerned with statistically partitioning differences between people into genetic and environmental sources of variance. However, understanding the concept of [[heritability]] can be tricky \u2013 heritability refers only to the differences between people, never the degree to which the traits of an individual are due to environmental or genetic factors, since traits are always a complex interweaving of both.)\n\nPersonality traits are conceptualized by evolutionary psychologists as due to normal variation around an optimum, due to frequency-dependent selection (behavioral [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphisms]]), or as facultative adaptations. Like variability in height, some personality traits may simply reflect inter-individual variability around a general optimum.<ref name=Gaulin-9/> Or, personality traits may represent different genetically predisposed \"behavioral morphs\" \u2013 alternate behavioral strategies that depend on the frequency of competing behavioral strategies in the population. For example, if most of the population is generally trusting and gullible, the behavioral morph of being a \"cheater\" (or, in the extreme case, a sociopath) may be advantageous.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0140525X00039595 |title=The sociobiology of sociopathy: An integrated evolutionary model |year=2010 |last1=Mealey |first1=Linda |journal=[[Behavioral and Brain Sciences]] |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=523\u201341}}\n</ref> Finally, like many other psychological adaptations, personality traits may be facultative \u2013 sensitive to typical variations in the social environment, especially during early development. For example, later born children are more likely than first borns to be rebellious, less conscientious and more open to new experiences, which may be advantageous to them given their particular niche in family structure.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sulloway |first=F. |year=1996 |title=Born to rebel. |url=https://archive.org/details/borntorebelbirth00sull |url-access=registration |location=NY |publisher=Pantheon}}</ref> It is important to note that shared environmental influences do play a role in personality and are not always of less importance than genetic factors.

Pinker and [[Paul Bloom (psychologist)|Bloom]] (1990) argue that language as a mental faculty shares many likenesses with the complex organs of the body which suggests that, like these organs, language has evolved as an adaptation, since this is the only known mechanism by which such complex organs can develop.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pinker |first1=S. |last2=Bloom |first2=P. |year=1990 |title=Natural language and natural selection |journal=[[Behavioral and Brain Sciences]] |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=707\u201327 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X00081061 |citeseerx=10.1.1.116.4044 }}</ref>\n\nPinker follows Chomsky in arguing that the fact that children can learn any human language with no explicit instruction suggests that language, including most of grammar, is basically innate and that it only needs to be activated by interaction.

Tomasello argues that studies of how children and primates actually acquire communicative skills suggests that humans learn complex behavior through experience, so that instead of a module specifically dedicated to language acquisition, language is acquired by the same cognitive mechanisms that are used to acquire all other kinds of socially transmitted behavior.<ref>Workman, Lance and Will Reader (2004) Evolutionary psychology: an introduction. Cambridge University Press p. 267</ref>\n\nOn the issue of whether language is best seen as having evolved as an adaptation or as a spandrel, evolutionary biologist [[W. Tecumseh Fitch]], following [[Stephen J. Gould]], argues that it is unwarranted to assume that every aspect of language is an adaptation, or that language as a whole is an adaptation. He criticizes some strands of evolutionary psychology for suggesting a pan-adaptionist view of evolution, and dismisses Pinker and Bloom's question of whether \"Language has evolved as an adaptation\" as being misleading. He argues instead that from a biological viewpoint the evolutionary origins of language is best conceptualized as being the probable result of a convergence of many separate adaptations into a complex system.<ref>W. Tecumseh Fitch (2010) The Evolution of Language. Cambridge University Press pp. 65\u201366</ref> A similar argument is made by [[Terrence Deacon]] who in ''[[The Symbolic Species]]'' argues that the different features of language have co-evolved with the evolution of the mind and that the ability to use symbolic communication is integrated in all other cognitive processes.<ref>Deacon, Terrence W. (1997) The Symbolic Species: The Co-evolution of Language and the Brain. W.W. Norton & Co</ref>\n\nIf the theory that language could have evolved as a single adaptation is accepted, the question becomes which of its many functions has been the basis of adaptation. Several evolutionary hypotheses have been posited: that language evolved for the purpose of social grooming, that it evolved as a way to show mating potential or that it evolved to form social contracts. Evolutionary psychologists recognize that these theories are all speculative and that much more evidence is required to understand how language might have been selectively adapted.<ref>Workman, Lance and Will Reader (2004) Evolutionary psychology: an introduction.

(1972). Parental investment and sexual selection. In B. Campbell (Ed.), ''Sexual Selection and the Descent of Man''.

The size differences of [[gametes]] ([[anisogamy]]) is the fundamental, defining difference between males (small gametes \u2013 sperm) and females (large gametes \u2013 ova). Trivers noted that anisogamy typically results in different levels of parental investment between the sexes, with females initially investing more. Trivers proposed that this difference in parental investment leads to the [[sexual selection]] of different [[Human mating strategies|reproductive strategies]] between the sexes and to [[sexual conflict]]. For example, he suggested that the sex that invests less in offspring will generally compete for access to the higher-investing sex to increase their [[inclusive fitness]] (also see [[Bateman's principle]]<ref name=\"doi10.1038/hdy.1948.21\">{{Cite journal| first1 = A.

This particular pattern is predicted because the costs involved in mating for each sex are distinct. Women, on average, should prefer a mate who can offer resources (e.g., financial, commitment), thus, a woman risks losing such resources with a mate who commits emotional infidelity. Men, on the other hand, are never certain of the genetic paternity of their children because they do not bear the offspring themselves (\"paternity insecurity\"). This suggests that for men sexual infidelity would generally be more aversive than emotional infidelity because investing resources in another man's offspring does not lead to propagation of their own genes.<ref>Kalat, J.

These putative preferences are predicted to be especially apparent for short-term mating domains because a potential male mate would only be offering genes to a potential offspring. This hypothesis allows researchers to examine whether women select mates who have characteristics that indicate high genetic quality during the high fertility phase of their ovulatory cycles. Indeed, studies have shown that women's preferences vary across the ovulatory cycle. In particular, Haselton and Miller (2006) showed that highly fertile women prefer creative but poor men as short-term mates. Creativity may be a proxy for good genes.<ref>Miller, G. F. (2000b) ''The mating mind: How sexual choice shaped the evolution of human nature''. Anchor Books: New York.</ref> Research by Gangestad et al. (2004) indicates that highly fertile women prefer men who display social presence and intrasexual competition; these traits may act as cues that would help women predict which men may have, or would be able to acquire, resources.\n\n===Parenting===\n{{Main|Evolutionary psychology of parenting}}\n\nReproduction is always costly for women, and can also be for men. Individuals are limited in the degree to which they can devote time and resources to producing and raising their young, and such expenditure may also be detrimental to their future condition, survival and further reproductive output.\nParental investment is any parental expenditure (time, energy etc.) that benefits one [[offspring]] at a cost to parents' ability to invest in other components of fitness (Clutton-Brock 1991: 9; Trivers 1972). Components of fitness (Beatty 1992) include the well-being of existing offspring, parents' future [[sexual reproduction|reproduction]], and inclusive fitness through aid to kin ([[W. D. Hamilton|Hamilton]], 1964). Parental investment theory is a branch of life history theory.\n\nRobert Trivers' theory of parental investment predicts that the sex making the largest investment in [[lactation]], nurturing and protecting offspring will be more discriminating in mating and that the sex that invests less in offspring will compete for access to the higher investing sex (see [[Bateman's principle]]).<ref name=\"doi10.1038/hdy.1948.21\"/> Sex differences in parental effort are important in determining the strength of sexual selection.\n\nThe benefits of parental investment to the offspring are large and are associated with the effects on condition, growth, survival and ultimately, on reproductive success of the offspring. However, these benefits can come at the cost of parent's ability to reproduce in the future e.g. through the increased risk of injury when defending offspring against predators, the loss of mating opportunities whilst rearing offspring and an increase in the time to the next reproduction. Overall, parents are [[Selection (biology)|selected]] to maximize the difference between the benefits and the costs, and parental care will likely evolve when the benefits exceed the costs.\n\nThe [[Cinderella effect]] is an alleged high incidence of stepchildren being physically, emotionally or sexually abused, neglected, murdered, or otherwise mistreated at the hands of their stepparents at significantly higher rates than their genetic counterparts. It takes its name from the fairy tale character Cinderella, who in the story was cruelly mistreated by her stepmother and stepsisters.<ref>Daly, Matin, and Margo I. Wilson. (1999)</ref> Daly and Wilson (1996) noted: \"Evolutionary thinking led to the discovery of the most important risk factor for child homicide \u2013 the presence of a stepparent. Parental efforts and investments are valuable resources, and selection favors those parental psyches that allocate effort effectively to promote fitness. The adaptive problems that challenge parental decision making include both the accurate identification of one's offspring and the allocation of one's resources among them with sensitivity to their needs and abilities to convert parental investment into fitness increments\u2026. Stepchildren were seldom or never so valuable to one's expected fitness as one's own offspring would be, and those parental psyches that were easily parasitized by just any appealing youngster must always have incurred a selective disadvantage\"(Daly & Wilson, 1996, pp.&nbsp;64\u201365). However, they note that not all stepparents will \"want\" to abuse their partner's children, or that genetic parenthood is any insurance against abuse. They see step parental care as primarily \"mating effort\" towards the genetic parent.<ref name=Daly_Wilson_98>Daly & Wilson 1998</ref>\n\n===Family and kin===\n{{see also|Human inclusive fitness|Kin selection}}\nInclusive fitness is the sum of an organism's classical fitness (how many of its own offspring it produces and supports) and the number of equivalents of its own offspring it can add to the population by supporting others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.personalityresearch.org/evolutionary/inclusive.html|title=Evolutionary Psychology \u2013 Inclusive Fitness|accessdate=10 August 2016}}</ref> The first component is called classical fitness by Hamilton (1964).\n\nFrom the gene's point of view, evolutionary success ultimately depends on leaving behind the maximum number of copies of itself in the population. Until 1964, it was generally believed that genes only achieved this by causing the individual to leave the maximum number of viable offspring. However, in 1964 W. D. Hamilton proved mathematically that, because close relatives of an organism share some identical genes, a gene can also increase its evolutionary success by promoting the reproduction and survival of these related or otherwise similar individuals. Hamilton concluded that this leads natural selection to favor organisms that would behave in ways that maximize their inclusive fitness. It is also true that natural selection favors behavior that maximizes personal fitness.\n\nHamilton's rule describes mathematically whether or not a gene for altruistic behavior will spread in a population:\n:<math>rb > c \\ </math>\nwhere\n* <math>c \\ </math> is the reproductive cost to the altruist,\n* <math>b \\ </math> is the reproductive benefit to the recipient of the altruistic behavior, and\n* <math>r \\ </math> is the probability, above the population average, of the individuals sharing an altruistic gene \u2013 commonly viewed as \"degree of relatedness\".\n\nThe concept serves to explain how natural selection can perpetuate altruism. If there is an \"altruism gene\" (or complex of genes) that influences an organism's behavior to be helpful and protective of relatives and their offspring, this behavior also increases the proportion of the altruism gene in the population, because relatives are likely to share genes with the altruist due to [[identical by descent|common descent]]. Altruists may also have some way to recognize altruistic behavior in unrelated individuals and be inclined to support them. As Dawkins points out in ''The Selfish Gene'' (Chapter 6) and ''The Extended Phenotype'',<ref>Dawkins, Richard, \"The Extended Phenotype\", Oxford University Press 1982 (Chapter 9)</ref> this must be distinguished from the [[green-beard effect]].\n\nAlthough it is generally true that humans tend to be more altruistic toward their kin than toward non-kin, the relevant proximate mechanisms that mediate this cooperation have been debated (see [[kin recognition]]), with some arguing that kin status is determined primarily via social and cultural factors (such as co-residence, maternal association of sibs, etc.),<ref name=W2010>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2010.08.001 |title=Sixteen common misconceptions about the evolution of cooperation in humans |year=2011 |last1=West |first1=Stuart A. |last2=El Mouden |first2=Claire |last3=Gardner |first3=Andy |journal=Evolution and Human Behavior |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=231\u201362 |url=http://www.zoo.ox.ac.uk/group/west/pdf/WestElMoudenGardner_11.pdf |access-date=25 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812085608/http://www.zoo.ox.ac.uk/group/west/pdf/WestElMoudenGardner_11.pdf |archive-date=12 August 2017 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all |citeseerx=10.1.1.188.3318 }}</ref> while others have argued that kin recognition can also be mediated by biological factors such as facial resemblance and immunogenetic similarity of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC).<ref>Villinger, J., and Waldman, B.

Direct reciprocity can lead to the evolution of cooperation only if the probability, w, of another encounter between the same two individuals exceeds the cost-to-benefit ratio of the altruistic act:\n: w > c/b\n\nReciprocity can also be indirect if information about previous interactions is shared. Reputation allows evolution of cooperation by indirect reciprocity. Natural selection favors strategies that base the decision to help on the reputation of the recipient: studies show that people who are more helpful are more likely to receive help. The calculations of indirect reciprocity are complicated and only a tiny fraction of this universe has been uncovered, but again a simple rule has emerged.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=9634232 |year=1998 |last1=Nowak |first1=MA |last2=Sigmund |first2=K |title=Evolution of indirect reciprocity by image scoring |volume=393 |issue=6685 |pages=573\u201377 |doi=10.1038/31225 |journal=Nature |authorlink1=Martin Nowak |authorlink2=Karl Sigmund |bibcode=1998Natur.393..573N }}</ref> Indirect reciprocity can only promote cooperation if the probability, q, of knowing someone's reputation exceeds the cost-to-benefit ratio of the altruistic act:\n: q > c/b\n\nOne important problem with this explanation is that individuals may be able to evolve the capacity to obscure their reputation, reducing the probability, q, that it will be known.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature04201 |title=Human cooperation: Second-order free-riding problem solved? |last1=Fowler |first1=James H. |journal=Nature |volume=437 |issue=7058 |pages=E8; discussion E8\u20139 |authorlink1=James H.

Males being more aggressive is hypothesized to stem from the more intense reproductive competition faced by them. Males of low status may be especially vulnerable to being childless. It may have been evolutionary advantageous to engage in highly risky and violently aggressive behavior to increase their status and therefore reproductive success. This may explain why males are generally involved in more crimes, and why low status and being unmarried is associated with criminality. Furthermore, competition over females is argued to have been particularly intensive in late adolescence and young adulthood, which is theorized to explain why crime rates are particularly high during this period.<ref name=AEP>Aurelio Jos\u00e9 Figueredo, Paul Robert Gladden, Zachary Hohman.

One example is the evolutionary psychology model of extended social groups selecting for modern human brains, a contradiction being that the synaptic function of modern human brains require high amounts of many specific [[nutrient#Essentiality|essential nutrients]] so that such a transition to higher requirements of the same essential nutrients being shared by all individuals in a population would decrease the possibility of forming large groups due to bottleneck foods with rare essential nutrients capping group sizes. It is mentioned that some insects have societies with different ranks for each individual and that monkeys remain socially functioning after removal of most of the brain as additional arguments against big brains promoting social networking. The model of males as both providers and protectors is criticized for the impossibility of being in two places at once, the male cannot both protect his family at home and be out hunting at the same time. In the case of the claim that a provider male could buy protection service for his family from other males by [[barter]]ing food that he had hunted, critics point at the fact that the most valuable food (the food that contained the rarest essential nutrients) would be different in different ecologies and as such vegetable in some geographical areas and animal in others, making it impossible for hunting styles relying on physical strength or risk taking to be universally of similar value in bartered food and instead making it inevitable that in some parts of Africa, food gathered with no need for major physical strength would be the most valuable to barter for protection. A contradiction between evolutionary psychology's claim of men needing to be more sexually visual than women for fast speed of assessing women's fertility than women needed to be able to assess the male's genes and its claim of male sexual jealousy guarding against infidelity is also pointed at, as it would be pointless for a male to be fast to assess female fertility if he needed to assess the risk of there being a jealous male mate and in that case his chances of defeating him before mating anyway (pointlessness of assessing one necessary condition faster than another necessary condition can possibly be assessed).<ref>WE Frankenhuis Environmental unpredictability, Encyclopedia of Evolutionary Psychological Science, 2016 - Springer</ref><ref>Douglas T Kenrick, VIadas Griskevicius, Omar Mahmoud The rational animal: How evolution made us smarter than we think, 2016</ref>\n\n===Standard social science model===\n{{Main|Standard social science model}}\nEvolutionary psychology has been entangled in the larger philosophical and social science controversies related to the debate on [[nature versus nurture]].

The discipline is generally not focused on proximate analyses of behavior, but rather its focus is on the study of distal/ultimate causality (the evolution of psychological adaptations). The field of behavioral genetics is focused on the study of the proximate influence of genes on behavior.<ref name=AmPs2010/>\n\n===Testability of hypotheses===\n{{See also|Just-so story}}\n\nA frequent critique of the discipline is that the hypotheses of evolutionary psychology are frequently arbitrary and difficult or impossible to adequately test, thus questioning its status as an actual scientific discipline, for example because many current traits probably evolved to serve different functions than they do now.<ref name=Psychology/><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ryle |first1=Anthony |year=2005 |title=The Relevance of Evolutionary Psychology for Psychotherapy |journal=British Journal of Psychotherapy |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=375\u201388 |doi=10.1111/j.1752-0118.2005.tb00225.x |url=|accessdate=}}</ref> Thus because there are a potentially infinite number of alternative explanations for why a trait evolved, critics contend that it is impossible to determine the exact explanation.<ref>Murphy, Dominic. \"Adaptationism and psychological explanation.\" In Evolutionary Psychology, pp. 161-184.

Some critics have argued that researchers know so little about the environment in which ''Homo sapiens'' evolved that explaining specific traits as an adaption to that environment becomes highly speculative.<ref name=Plotkin-Henry-p.149>Plotkin, Henry. 2004 Evolutionary thought in Psychology: A Brief History.

Buss, Chapter 1, pp. 5\u201367, Conceptual Foundations of Evolutionary Psychology, John Tooby and Leda Cosmides</ref> Edward Hagen argues that the human past environments were not radically different in the same sense as the Carboniferous or Jurassic periods and that the animal and plant taxa of the era were similar to those of the modern world, as was the geology and ecology. Hagen argues that few would deny that other organs evolved in the EEA (for example, lungs evolving in an oxygen rich atmopshere) yet critics question whether or not the brain's EEA is truly knowable, which he argues constitutes selective scepticism. Hagen also argues that most evolutionary psychology research is based on the fact that females can get pregnant and males cannot, which Hagen observes was also true in the EEA.<ref>Hagen, Edward H. [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3c0a/00542025db83139099e0ce4f3c17b8369ab6.pdf ''Invariant world, invariant mind. Evolutionary psychology and its critics''.] (2014).</ref><ref>Hagen, Edward H.

Alcock argues that present day evidence allows researchers to be reasonably confident about the conditions of the EEA and that the fact that so many human behaviours are adaptive in the ''current'' environment is evidence that the ancestral environment of humans had much in common with the present one, as these behaviours would have evolved in the ancestral environment. Thus Alcock concludes that researchers can make predictions on the adaptive value of traits.<ref>Maryanski, A., Machalek, R. and Turner, J.H., 2015. Handbook on evolution and society: Toward an evolutionary social science. Routledge. pp.161-163</ref> Similarly, Dominic Murphy argues that alternative explanations cannot just be forwarded but instead need their own evidence and predictions - if one explanation makes predictions that the others cannot, it is reasonable to have confidence in that explanation. In addition, Murphy argues that other historical sciences also make predictions about modern phenomena to come up with explanations about past phenomena, for example cosmologists look for evidence for what we would expect to see in the modern day if the Big Bang was true, while geologists make predictions about modern phenomena to determine if an asteroid wiped out the dinosaurs. Murphy argues that if other historical disciplines can conduct tests without a time machine, then the onus is on the critics to show why evolutionary psychology is untestable if other historical disciplines are not, as \"methods should be judged across the board, not singled out for ridicule in one context.\"<ref>Murphy, Dominic. \"Adaptationism and psychological explanation.\" In Evolutionary Psychology, pp. 161-184.
