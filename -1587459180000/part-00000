The song was released as the album's second single on 24 November 1997 through [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]], [[Deconstruction Records|Deconstruction]] and [[Mushroom Records|Mushroom]]. Minogue had written the track with [[Steve Anderson (musician)|Steve Anderson]] and [[Dave Seaman]], and it was produced by Minogue in collaboration with [[Brothers in Rhythm]]. Backed by guitars and drum, \"Did It Again\" is a [[pop rock]] track in which Minogue sings about her [[self-consciousness]] and [[self-hatred]].\n\nCritical response to \"Did It Again\" was mostly positive; some critics praised the song's composition and highlighted it as a career stand out track. In Australia, \"Did It Again\" peaked at number fifteen on the [[ARIA Charts|Australian Singles Chart]] and was certified gold by the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA). In the United Kingdom, it peaked at fourteen on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. Petro Romanhi directed the song's [[music video]], which features four clones of Minogue in different outfits, and fighting with each other.\n\nTo promote \"Did It Again\", Minogue performed the track on ''[[The National Lottery Draws|The National Lottery Live]]'' and [[MTV]] UK. It was later included on her 1998 concert tour [[Intimate and Live (concert tour)|Intimate and Live Tour]]. The song was subsequently included on Minogue's compilation albums ''[[Confide in Me (2001 album)|Confide in Me]]'' (2002), ''[[Ultimate Kylie]]'' (2004), ''[[Confide in Me: The Irresistible Kylie]]'' (2007) and ''[[Step Back In Time: The Definitive Collection]]'' (2019).\n\n==Background==\nIn 1997, the British media reported that she was [[anorexia nervosa|anorexic]], labelling her \"Kylie Thinogue\". Minogue had been told about the rumours and, as a response, wrote the track \"Did It Again\".<ref name=\"diditagain\"/> Interviewed by ''[[Company (magazine)|Company]]'' magazine that year, she was questioned on her weight and the song, and she explained \"It's a bit of a girl's song, with me telling myself off and never learning my lesson, particularly with men. It's me looking myself in the eye and saying 'You fool, stop being too clever and over-neurotic.' She had begun writing the song whilst British tabloids published rumors about her private life, and the poor reception that ''Impossible Princess''' lead single \"[[Some Kind of Bliss]]\" received. However, she re-wrote the original lyrics with Anderson and Seaman and Minogue said it told a \"different meaning\".<ref name=\"diditagain\">{{cite AV media notes |title=An Interview with Kylie Minogue|others=Kylie Minogue|year=1997 |chapter=An Interview with Kylie Minogue booklet \"Did It Again\"|first=Kylie|last=Minogue|page=31|type=Audio CD |publisher=Deconstruction |id=KM002|location=London, England}}</ref><ref name=\"bio\">{{cite web| first=Chris | last=True | url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/kylie-minogue-mn0000776093/biography |title=AllMusic \u2013 Kylie Minogue, Biography, Songs, Highlights, Credits and Awards |work=Rovi.

The song was released as the album's second single on 24 November 1997 through [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]], [[Deconstruction Records|Deconstruction]] and [[Mushroom Records|Mushroom]]. Minogue had written the track with [[Steve Anderson (musician)|Steve Anderson]] and [[Dave Seaman]], and it was produced by Minogue in collaboration with [[Brothers in Rhythm]]. Backed by guitars and drum, \"Did It Again\" is a [[pop rock]] track in which Minogue sings about her [[self-consciousness]] and [[self-hatred]].\n\nCritical response to \"Did It Again\" was mostly positive; some critics praised the song's composition and highlighted it as a career stand out track. In Australia, \"Did It Again\" peaked at number fifteen on the [[ARIA Charts|Australian Singles Chart]] and was certified gold by the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA). In the United Kingdom, it peaked at fourteen on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. Petro Romanhi directed the song's [[music video]], which features four clones of Minogue in different outfits, and fighting with each other.\n\nTo promote \"Did It Again\", Minogue performed the track on ''[[The National Lottery Draws|The National Lottery Live]]'' and [[MTV]] UK. It was later included on her 1998 concert tour [[Intimate and Live (concert tour)|Intimate and Live Tour]]. The song was subsequently included on Minogue's compilation albums ''[[Confide in Me (2001 album)|Confide in Me]]'' (2002), ''[[Ultimate Kylie]]'' (2004), ''[[Confide in Me: The Irresistible Kylie]]'' (2007) and ''[[Step Back In Time: The Definitive Collection]]'' (2019).\n\n==Background==\nIn 1997, the British media reported that she was [[anorexia nervosa|anorexic]], labelling her \"Kylie Thinogue\". Minogue had been told about the rumours and, as a response, wrote the track \"Did It Again\".<ref name=\"diditagain\"/> Interviewed by ''[[Company (magazine)|Company]]'' magazine that year, she was questioned on her weight and the song, and she explained \"It's a bit of a girl's song, with me telling myself off and never learning my lesson, particularly with men. It's me looking myself in the eye and saying 'You fool, stop being too clever and over-neurotic.' She had begun writing the song whilst British tabloids published rumors about her private life, and the poor reception that ''Impossible Princess''' lead single \"[[Some Kind of Bliss]]\" received. However, she re-wrote the original lyrics with Anderson and Seaman and Minogue said it told a \"different meaning\".<ref name=\"diditagain\">{{cite AV media notes |title=An Interview with Kylie Minogue|others=Kylie Minogue|year=1997 |chapter=An Interview with Kylie Minogue booklet \"Did It Again\"|first=Kylie|last=Minogue|page=31|type=Audio CD |publisher=Deconstruction |id=KM002|location=London, England}}</ref><ref name=\"bio\">{{cite web| first=Chris | last=True | url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/kylie-minogue-mn0000776093/biography |title=AllMusic \u2013 Kylie Minogue, Biography, Songs, Highlights, Credits and Awards |work=Rovi.

However, he feared the fact that Japanese authorities were eager to suppress the education of Hangul during the late 1930s given that ordinary Koreans had not been able to use Korean names at this time.<ref>[http://samedi.livejournal.com/312017.html Livejournal: Gansong Art Museum]</ref> Therefore, Jeon made Hunminjeongeum public after the independence of South Korea.<ref>Shin Byeong ju, \u300a\uc870\uc120\ud3c9\uc804\u300b, p.111, 2011.</ref>\n\n=== Goryeo porcelain ===\nGoryeo porcelain is said to be one of the most valuable cultural assets of Korea during the reign of [[Goryeo]] since the 12th century. However,  a great deal of porcelains were easy to be brought abroad without specific control on assets. In this regard, Jeon tried to find out some pieces which had been brought out of Korean peninsula. From his own work through the institute, a British lawyer got on the list. It was John Gatsby who possessed twenty two pieces of Goryeo porcelains at the moment. In fact, the deal was beyond reach since the price of the twenty two was more expensive than 400,000 won which Jeon suggested. In the meantime, John finally agreed to give twenty pieces back to the homeland after finding out Jeon's work to save Korean artistic figure and kept two pieces himself.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://211.252.141.1/files/upload/ebook/6/Vol07.pdf |title=National Museum of Korea |access-date=2013-02-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140916170330/http://211.252.141.1/files/upload/ebook/6/Vol07.pdf |archive-date=2014-09-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== Korean War ===\nDuring Korean war, North Korean authorities harshly tried to steal all the assets of Gansong museum.

However, he feared the fact that Japanese authorities were eager to suppress the education of Hangul during the late 1930s given that ordinary Koreans had not been able to use Korean names at this time.<ref>[http://samedi.livejournal.com/312017.html Livejournal: Gansong Art Museum]</ref> Therefore, Jeon made Hunminjeongeum public after the independence of South Korea.<ref>Shin Byeong ju, \u300a\uc870\uc120\ud3c9\uc804\u300b, p.111, 2011.</ref>\n\n=== Goryeo porcelain ===\nGoryeo porcelain is said to be one of the most valuable cultural assets of Korea during the reign of [[Goryeo]] since the 12th century. However,  a great deal of porcelains were easy to be brought abroad without specific control on assets. In this regard, Jeon tried to find out some pieces which had been brought out of Korean peninsula. From his own work through the institute, a British lawyer got on the list. It was John Gatsby who possessed twenty two pieces of Goryeo porcelains at the moment. In fact, the deal was beyond reach since the price of the twenty two was more expensive than 400,000 won which Jeon suggested. In the meantime, John finally agreed to give twenty pieces back to the homeland after finding out Jeon's work to save Korean artistic figure and kept two pieces himself.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://211.252.141.1/files/upload/ebook/6/Vol07.pdf |title=National Museum of Korea |access-date=2013-02-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140916170330/http://211.252.141.1/files/upload/ebook/6/Vol07.pdf |archive-date=2014-09-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== Korean War ===\nDuring Korean war, North Korean authorities harshly tried to steal all the assets of Gansong museum. From this kind of threat, he could not leave Seoul even for a while. The tactic brought his colleagues and friends to protect cultural relics amid the conflicts since the control over the capital area had gone through some changes. Jeon also didn't leave Seoul amid bombard.\n\n==See also==\n* [[National treasures of Korea]]\n* [[List of Korean painters]] \n* [[Korean ceramics]]\n* [[Shin Yun-bok]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.scholarsresource.com/browse/museum/32 See our collections]\n* [https://m.facebook.com/profile.php?id=211924898827287 Facebook account of Museum]\n*[http://kansong.org/ Gansong Art Museum] {{in lang|ko}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1906 births]]\n[[Category:1962 deaths]]\n[[Category:Korean educators]]\n[[Category:Korean scholars]]\n[[Category:Waseda University alumni]]\n[[Category:20th-century Korean painters]]\n", "name_user": "Will Sandberg", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeon_Hyeongpil"}

To date he has released 3 solo albums and six E.P's under his performer name of Stoney. Known for his sharp lyrics and classic melodies, he first came to  prominence in the \"New Yorkshire\" music scene (as the [[NME]] would label it) in the mid 2000s touring and working alongside acts such as [[Arctic Monkeys]], [[Long Blondes]] and [[Reverend and the Makers]]. \nFollowing relocation to Austin, Texas in 2009, he became a founding member, songwriter and guitarist of acclaimed \"dirt-pop\" band Bobby Jealousy, who released two full-length albums between 2012\u20132014, before resuming his solo career back in the UK.\nStoney is also an accomplished producer and co-writer for up and coming talent and has worked with Ivor Novello award-winning [[Guy Chambers]], [[Rick Rubin]], [[Warren Huart]] and [[Tim Palmer]]. Stoney currently lives and works in [[Sheffield]], England.\n\n==Early career==\nStoney first appeared on the UK music scene following the release of his debut inventive and homegrown-style album ''Amber'' in 2001. A quirky collection of songs written in his teens, and recorded in his Sheffield basement following his escape from his hometown of [[Croydon]], it was independently distributed initially through a few local record shops on his own Holy Moly label. Stoney played all the instruments on the record.\nIn response to the positive public reaction, a full band was formed to take the songs to the stage, and a three track EP of songs from the album, entitled ''Amber EP'', was released nationally on [[Thunderbird records]] the next year gaining Stoney his first national radio airplay.\nStoney signed to [[Island Records]] in 2003, teaming up with producers Kevin Bacon and Jon Quarmby ([[Longpigs]], [[Richard Hawley]], [[Sugababes]], [[Finley Quaye]]) to record an album. During this time, Stoney and his band performed under the name of ''Stoneylacuna'', to reflect the change from the singer-songwriter feel of ''Amber'' to the bigger, full band sound of the new recordings. However, political wrangles ensued and Stoney parted company with the label the following year without a record being released.\n\n==The Scene and The Unseen==\nA few months after parting ways with Island Records, the limited edition single ''Constantly Running'' was released nationally on the small [[Transistor]] label, and became the single of the week on the [[iTunes]] music store, restarting a frenzy of activity. The single achieved over 17,000 downloads in the UK alone in the first week. Stoney followed up with the ''Soap in a Bathtub'' EP, which brought him further national exposure.  After forming a new band, Stoney provided the support for the [[Arctic Monkeys]] first sell-out UK tour in the Summer of 2005, alongside festival appearances at [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury]] and [[Leeds]].\nStoney became a regular guest on [[BBC Radio 2]]<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0088m4z</ref> and [[BBC 6Music]] and further shows with high-profile acts such as [[Jamie T]], [[Athlete (band)|Athlete]] & [[Feeder (band)|Feeder]] along with his own headline shows quickly gained him a reputation as an exhilarating and charismatic live performer, continuing to win him a steadily growing underground UK fanbase.  A double A-side single featuring fan favourites  ''Until You Leave'' and ''Holds the Stars'' was released at the end of 2005. Stoney released the 12 track album ''The Scene and The Unseen'' in the summer of 2006 on the independent [[Manchester]] based label Too Nice Recordings and as a download on iTunes.  Despite a typically low-key and organic release, it prompted widespread critical acclaim from the national UK papers, with rave reviews from ''[[The Independent]]'',<ref>https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/album-stoney-6095450.html</ref> [[NME]]'', ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'' and ''[[The Daily Express]]''. It reached Number 19 in the UK iTunes download chart and peaked at Number 4 in France. The album was re-released with full UK distribution on his own Sonic Roar Label in November 2007. During this period, Stoney also started producing other artists, and set up Lacuna Productions, a record production company with fellow Sheffield producer Sam Jones.  Lacuna birthed debut singles from several rising Sheffield indie stars such as [[Bromheads Jacket]] and Little Ze.\n\n==Relocation to US ==\nFollowing an acoustic show at the [[SXSW]] festival in Texas,<ref>https://sxsw2008.sched.org/event/11LIlhI/stoney</ref> he was flown to [[Los Angeles]] by [[Rick Rubin]] for a private showcase and champions of Stoney on US radio such as [[Nic Harcourt]] at [[KCRW]] raised Stoney's profile over the Atlantic. His tracks started to feature in several Hollywood films & TV series.  \nIn response Stoney relocated to [[Austin, Texas]] in 2009 and began working on new material with a number of producers including C.J Eiriksson ([[u2]], the rocket summer, Blue October), Darin Prindle ([[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Destiny's Child]]) His first public show was a stripped back set at the British Music Embassy showcase at [[SXSW]] alongside [[Laura Marling]] & [[Aqualung (musician)|Aqualung]] and presented by [[Nic Harcourt]].\nIn 2010, Stoney was among the earliest artists to implement the fan funding model, teaming up with [[PledgeMusic]], he successfully launched a new 4 track E.P entitled \"The Soar Before\" and an accompanying 16 date U.K tour with [[Athlete (band)|Athlete]]. The fans raised the target in 3 days, and the tour was followed by Stoney's fourth live session and interview on [[Dermot O'Leary]]'s BBC Radio 2 show, alongside fellow guest [[Paul McCartney]].\n\n==Bobby Jealousy ==\nIn the summer of 2012, Stoney took a departure from his solo career and co-founded a new band in Austin named \"Bobby Jealousy\" alongside local punk singer Sabrina Ellis and producer Seth Gibbs. The trio of songwriters adopted the services of drummer Clint Simmons and quickly established a strong following in Austin with a series of raucous live residencies around the City. Their debut album \"A little Death\" was recorded at Gibb's Superpop Studio in the space of a few weeks and was met with critical acclaim,<ref>http://www.austin360.com/news/entertainment/music/the-enviable-position-of-bobby-jealousy-1/nRkWN/</ref><ref>http://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/chrontourage/2012-03-31/bobby-jealousy/</ref> with the lead single \"Rainbow\" being adopted as the theme tune for Comedy Central's \"[[Big Time in Hollywood, FL]]\" TV Show.<ref>http://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/music/2015-04-01/reanimating-bobby-jealousy/</ref> The band released a follow up album \"The Importance of being Jealous\", appeared at the [[Austin City Limits Music Festival]] and conducted two tours of the United States before parting ways in 2014.\n\n==More than Animals==\nFollowing the break up of Bobby Jealousy, Stoney resumed work on a Solo album and in 2014 released his third full album \"More Than Animals\" once again to critical acclaim.  Largely self produced, several tracks from the album were mixed in Los Angeles with Producer [[Warren Huart]]. The release was again fan-funded through [[Pledgemusic]], and met with very favorable reviews internationally.<ref>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/marcel-hidalgo/musician-mark-stoney-on-a_b_4597318.html</ref><ref>http://www.thedailyopinion.co.uk/the-savage-beauty-of-stoney/</ref><ref>http://wordkrapht.com/main/2014/01/10/stoney-more-than-animals/</ref><ref>http://underthegunreview.net/2013/12/02/review-stoney-more-than-animals/</ref> A video for the album track \"We Belonged\" was shot in the Hill Country in Texas to accompany the album release<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLJGuwUEHh0</ref> and the track has since been used in the Series finale of popular us TV show [[Hart of Dixie]] and the feature film \"The Funeral Guest\".<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3333920/soundtrack?ref_=tt_trv_snd</ref> The album track \"Devil on My Back\" was used in the 1st series finale of [[Legends (TV series)]] Starring Sean Bean.\n\n==Current work==\nAfter moving back to the UK in 2015, Stoney began working extensively as a producer and co-writer, helping to develop and support emerging talent across multiple genres<ref>https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/8-north-east-acts-join-11435459</ref>, as well as collaborations with established artists such as [[The Big Pink]] and Jade Castrinos (of [[Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros]]) \nIn early 2020, Stoney announced on social media the forthcoming release of new solo material later in the year.  \n\n\n\n==Discography==\n'''As Stoney:'''\n\n* ''Constantly Running''.

To date he has released 3 solo albums and six E.P's under his performer name of Stoney. Known for his sharp lyrics and classic melodies, he first came to  prominence in the \"New Yorkshire\" music scene (as the [[NME]] would label it) in the mid 2000s touring and working alongside acts such as [[Arctic Monkeys]], [[Long Blondes]] and [[Reverend and the Makers]]. \nFollowing relocation to Austin, Texas in 2009, he became a founding member, songwriter and guitarist of acclaimed \"dirt-pop\" band Bobby Jealousy, who released two full-length albums between 2012\u20132014, before resuming his solo career back in the UK.\nStoney is also an accomplished producer and co-writer for up and coming talent and has worked with Ivor Novello award-winning [[Guy Chambers]], [[Rick Rubin]], [[Warren Huart]] and [[Tim Palmer]]. Stoney currently lives and works in [[Sheffield]], England.\n\n==Early career==\nStoney first appeared on the UK music scene following the release of his debut inventive and homegrown-style album ''Amber'' in 2001. A quirky collection of songs written in his teens, and recorded in his Sheffield basement following his escape from his hometown of [[Croydon]], it was independently distributed initially through a few local record shops on his own Holy Moly label. Stoney played all the instruments on the record.\nIn response to the positive public reaction, a full band was formed to take the songs to the stage, and a three track EP of songs from the album, entitled ''Amber EP'', was released nationally on [[Thunderbird records]] the next year gaining Stoney his first national radio airplay.\nStoney signed to [[Island Records]] in 2003, teaming up with producers Kevin Bacon and Jon Quarmby ([[Longpigs]], [[Richard Hawley]], [[Sugababes]], [[Finley Quaye]]) to record an album. During this time, Stoney and his band performed under the name of ''Stoneylacuna'', to reflect the change from the singer-songwriter feel of ''Amber'' to the bigger, full band sound of the new recordings. However, political wrangles ensued and Stoney parted company with the label the following year without a record being released.\n\n==The Scene and The Unseen==\nA few months after parting ways with Island Records, the limited edition single ''Constantly Running'' was released nationally on the small [[Transistor]] label, and became the single of the week on the [[iTunes]] music store, restarting a frenzy of activity. The single achieved over 17,000 downloads in the UK alone in the first week. Stoney followed up with the ''Soap in a Bathtub'' EP, which brought him further national exposure.  After forming a new band, Stoney provided the support for the [[Arctic Monkeys]] first sell-out UK tour in the Summer of 2005, alongside festival appearances at [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury]] and [[Leeds]].\nStoney became a regular guest on [[BBC Radio 2]]<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0088m4z</ref> and [[BBC 6Music]] and further shows with high-profile acts such as [[Jamie T]], [[Athlete (band)|Athlete]] & [[Feeder (band)|Feeder]] along with his own headline shows quickly gained him a reputation as an exhilarating and charismatic live performer, continuing to win him a steadily growing underground UK fanbase.  A double A-side single featuring fan favourites  ''Until You Leave'' and ''Holds the Stars'' was released at the end of 2005. Stoney released the 12 track album ''The Scene and The Unseen'' in the summer of 2006 on the independent [[Manchester]] based label Too Nice Recordings and as a download on iTunes.  Despite a typically low-key and organic release, it prompted widespread critical acclaim from the national UK papers, with rave reviews from ''[[The Independent]]'',<ref>https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/album-stoney-6095450.html</ref> [[NME]]'', ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'' and ''[[The Daily Express]]''. It reached Number 19 in the UK iTunes download chart and peaked at Number 4 in France. The album was re-released with full UK distribution on his own Sonic Roar Label in November 2007. During this period, Stoney also started producing other artists, and set up Lacuna Productions, a record production company with fellow Sheffield producer Sam Jones.  Lacuna birthed debut singles from several rising Sheffield indie stars such as [[Bromheads Jacket]] and Little Ze.\n\n==Relocation to US ==\nFollowing an acoustic show at the [[SXSW]] festival in Texas,<ref>https://sxsw2008.sched.org/event/11LIlhI/stoney</ref> he was flown to [[Los Angeles]] by [[Rick Rubin]] for a private showcase and champions of Stoney on US radio such as [[Nic Harcourt]] at [[KCRW]] raised Stoney's profile over the Atlantic. His tracks started to feature in several Hollywood films & TV series.  \nIn response Stoney relocated to [[Austin, Texas]] in 2009 and began working on new material with a number of producers including C.J Eiriksson ([[u2]], the rocket summer, Blue October), Darin Prindle ([[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Destiny's Child]]) His first public show was a stripped back set at the British Music Embassy showcase at [[SXSW]] alongside [[Laura Marling]] & [[Aqualung (musician)|Aqualung]] and presented by [[Nic Harcourt]].\nIn 2010, Stoney was among the earliest artists to implement the fan funding model, teaming up with [[PledgeMusic]], he successfully launched a new 4 track E.P entitled \"The Soar Before\" and an accompanying 16 date U.K tour with [[Athlete (band)|Athlete]]. The fans raised the target in 3 days, and the tour was followed by Stoney's fourth live session and interview on [[Dermot O'Leary]]'s BBC Radio 2 show, alongside fellow guest [[Paul McCartney]].\n\n==Bobby Jealousy ==\nIn the summer of 2012, Stoney took a departure from his solo career and co-founded a new band in Austin named \"Bobby Jealousy\" alongside local punk singer Sabrina Ellis and producer Seth Gibbs. The trio of songwriters adopted the services of drummer Clint Simmons and quickly established a strong following in Austin with a series of raucous live residencies around the City. Their debut album \"A little Death\" was recorded at Gibb's Superpop Studio in the space of a few weeks and was met with critical acclaim,<ref>http://www.austin360.com/news/entertainment/music/the-enviable-position-of-bobby-jealousy-1/nRkWN/</ref><ref>http://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/chrontourage/2012-03-31/bobby-jealousy/</ref> with the lead single \"Rainbow\" being adopted as the theme tune for Comedy Central's \"[[Big Time in Hollywood, FL]]\" TV Show.<ref>http://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/music/2015-04-01/reanimating-bobby-jealousy/</ref> The band released a follow up album \"The Importance of being Jealous\", appeared at the [[Austin City Limits Music Festival]] and conducted two tours of the United States before parting ways in 2014.\n\n==More than Animals==\nFollowing the break up of Bobby Jealousy, Stoney resumed work on a Solo album and in 2014 released his third full album \"More Than Animals\" once again to critical acclaim.  Largely self produced, several tracks from the album were mixed in Los Angeles with Producer [[Warren Huart]]. The release was again fan-funded through [[Pledgemusic]], and met with very favorable reviews internationally.<ref>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/marcel-hidalgo/musician-mark-stoney-on-a_b_4597318.html</ref><ref>http://www.thedailyopinion.co.uk/the-savage-beauty-of-stoney/</ref><ref>http://wordkrapht.com/main/2014/01/10/stoney-more-than-animals/</ref><ref>http://underthegunreview.net/2013/12/02/review-stoney-more-than-animals/</ref> A video for the album track \"We Belonged\" was shot in the Hill Country in Texas to accompany the album release<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLJGuwUEHh0</ref> and the track has since been used in the Series finale of popular us TV show [[Hart of Dixie]] and the feature film \"The Funeral Guest\".<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3333920/soundtrack?ref_=tt_trv_snd</ref> The album track \"Devil on My Back\" was used in the 1st series finale of [[Legends (TV series)]] Starring Sean Bean.\n\n==Current work==\nAfter moving back to the UK in 2015, Stoney began working extensively as a producer and co-writer, helping to develop and support emerging talent across multiple genres<ref>https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/8-north-east-acts-join-11435459</ref>, as well as collaborations with established artists such as [[The Big Pink]] and Jade Castrinos (of [[Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros]]) \nIn early 2020, Stoney announced on social media the forthcoming release of new solo material later in the year.  \n\n\n\n==Discography==\n'''As Stoney:'''\n\n* ''Constantly Running''.
