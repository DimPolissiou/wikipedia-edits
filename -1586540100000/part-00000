Seventy years ago, a child might have been told that masturbation would cause insanity, acne, sterility, or other such nonsense. \"Self-abuse,\" as it was then called, has enjoyed a long and unfortunate history of religious and medical disapproval (Caroll, 2013). The modern view is that masturbation is a normal sexual behavior (Hogarth & Ingham, 2009). Enlightened parents are well aware of this fact. Still, many children are punished or made to feel guilty for touching their genitals. This is unfortunate because masturbation itself is harmless. Typically, its only negative effects are feelings of fear, guilt, or anxiety that arise from learning to think of masturbation as \"bad\" or \"wrong.\" In an age when people are urged to practice \"[[safer sex]],\" masturbation remains the safest sex of all.}}</ref><ref name=\"Sigel2004\">{{cite journal|last=Sigel|first=Lisa Z.|date=Summer 2004|title=Masturbation: The History of the Great Terror by Jean Stengers; Ann Van Neck; Kathryn Hoffmann|journal=Journal of Social History|volume=37|series= |issue=4|pages=1065\u20131066|issn=0022-4529|accessdate=|quote=Stengers and Van Neck follow the illness to its fairly abrupt demise; they liken the shift to finally seeing the emperor without clothes as doctors began to doubt masturbation as a cause of illness at the turn of the twentieth century.

The implications were clear: if most people masturbated and did not experience insanity, debility, and early death, then masturbation could not be held accountable to the etiology that had been assigned it.

Seventy years ago, a child might have been told that masturbation would cause insanity, acne, sterility, or other such nonsense. \"Self-abuse,\" as it was then called, has enjoyed a long and unfortunate history of religious and medical disapproval (Caroll, 2013). The modern view is that masturbation is a normal sexual behavior (Hogarth & Ingham, 2009). Enlightened parents are well aware of this fact. Still, many children are punished or made to feel guilty for touching their genitals. This is unfortunate because masturbation itself is harmless. Typically, its only negative effects are feelings of fear, guilt, or anxiety that arise from learning to think of masturbation as \"bad\" or \"wrong.\" In an age when people are urged to practice \"[[safer sex]],\" masturbation remains the safest sex of all.}}</ref><ref name=\"Sigel2004\">{{cite journal|last=Sigel|first=Lisa Z.|date=Summer 2004|title=Masturbation: The History of the Great Terror by Jean Stengers; Ann Van Neck; Kathryn Hoffmann|journal=Journal of Social History|volume=37|series= |issue=4|pages=1065\u20131066|issn=0022-4529|accessdate=|quote=Stengers and Van Neck follow the illness to its fairly abrupt demise; they liken the shift to finally seeing the emperor without clothes as doctors began to doubt masturbation as a cause of illness at the turn of the twentieth century.

The implications were clear: if most people masturbated and did not experience insanity, debility, and early death, then masturbation could not be held accountable to the etiology that had been assigned it.

He has been recognized for his expertise in the control of trace organic and inorganic contaminants and microbial pathogens in water. He is also known for his work in the identification, control and treatment of taste and odor problems in drinking water.  He has published numerous articles in professional journals and he has been the co-editor of five books and compilations of articles.  He published a book that documented the first continuous disinfection of a drinking water supply in the U.S.<ref name=McGuire>McGuire, Michael J. (2013). ''The Chlorine Revolution:  Water Disinfection and the Fight to Save Lives.'' Denver, CO:American Water Works Association.</ref> He has been active in the [[American Water Works Association]], and he has served as a volunteer and officer in that organization. In 2009, he was elected to the [[National Academy of Engineering]].\n\n==Early life and education==\n\nMichael J. McGuire was born in 1947 at Brooke General Army Hospital in [[San Antonio, Texas]].  He attended grammar school in a number of locations, because his father was in the U.S. Army and stationed in several places during McGuire's early years. From 1955 to 1957, McGuire attended the grammar school run for U.S. Army dependents in [[Orleans, France]]. He went to Francis C. Hammond High School in Alexandria, Virginia.<ref>[http://www.hammondhighschool.com/ Francis C. Hammond High School, the Home of the Admirals]</ref>\n\nHe earned his undergraduate degree in civil engineering at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1969. During the period 1970 to 1972, he attended [[Drexel University]] part-time while he worked for the [[Philadelphia Water Department]]. After earning his master's degree in [[Environmental Engineering]] in 1972, he returned to [[Drexel University]] on a full-time basis to study for his PhD degree. He completed his PhD and graduated in 1977.<ref>McGuire, Michael J.

Philadelphia, Pennsylvania:Drexel University.</ref>\n\n==Early career==\n\nMcGuire worked for the [[Philadelphia Water Department]] from 1969 to 1973. Throughout this period, he was assigned to the Research and Development Unit under Joseph V. Radziul.<ref>McGuire, M.J., Suffet, I.H., and Radziul, J.V. (1977). \"The Development of Optimum Unit Processes for the Removal of Trace Organic Compounds from Drinking Water,\" Proceedings Annual Conference American Water Works Association. Anaheim, California.]</ref> He participated in a variety of projects including the supervision of a research program that involved the surveillance of the water quality of the [[Delaware River]] Estuary.  The program required operational supervision of a boat pilot, chemists, engineers, and technicians and the formulation of a data analysis program.  He designed an unusual application of automated water quality analytical equipment aboard a research vessel.<ref>McGuire, M.J. (1972). \"Economic Justification for the Automation of Water Quality Analytical Techniques.\" Advances in Automated Analyses, 4, p. 51.</ref> His other projects included investigation of the availability of future water resources, preparation of testimony given before governmental bodies, and investigation of the effects of urbanization on [[water quality]] and quantity.\n\n==Metropolitan Water District of Southern California==\n\nMcGuire moved to [[California]] in 1977 where he had a two-year stint with the consulting engineering firm, Brown and Caldwell. In 1979, he was offered a position as a water quality engineer with the [[Metropolitan Water District of Southern California]] (Metropolitan). He directed a variety of physical chemical treatment and environmental chemistry projects, and he ran the central water laboratory for Metropolitan. As Water Quality Manager and Director of Water Quality for Metropolitan he supervised the Water Quality Branch and Division, respectively, which grew to a total of 82 scientists, engineers and administrators. During this period he designed a comprehensive research program to determine the cause of earthy musty odor problems in six southern California reservoirs.<ref>McGuire, M.J., Krasner, S.W., Hwang, C.J., and Izaguirre, G. (1983). \"An Early Warning System for Detecting Earthy Musty Odors in Reservoirs.\" Water Science and Technology. 15:6/7, 267 277.</ref> Once the cause was isolated to blue-green algae growing on the bottom of the reservoirs, he devised a methodology to control the growth of the algae and prevent the occurrence of taste and odor problems in the Metropolitan service area.<ref>McGuire, M.J., Jones, R.M., Means, E.G., Izaguirre, G., and Preston, A.E. (1984). \"Controlling Attached Blue Green Algae with Copper Sulfate.\" Jour. AWWA. 76:5, 60 65.</ref> In 1984\u201385, he managed the conversion of Metropolitan's secondary disinfection system from free chlorine to chloramines.<ref>Kreft, P., Umphres, M., Hand, J. M., Tate, C., McGuire, M.J., and Trussell, R.R. (1985). \"Converting from Chlorine to Chloramines:  A Case Study.\" Jour. AWWA. 77:1, 38 45.</ref>\n\nIn 1990, he became Assistant General Manager at Metropolitan where he was responsible for administration and environmental compliance.  Five divisions reported to him in addition to Metropolitan's Affirmative Action Officer.\n\n==Consulting firms and teaching assignments==\n\nIn 1992, McGuire left Metropolitan and opened a one-man consulting engineering firm\u2014McGuire Environmental Consultants, Inc. (MEC). After five years, he started to grow the firm until it ultimately had 37 employees in three offices: Santa Monica and Newport Beach, California and Denver, Colorado. During the period 1992 to 2000, McGuire was the leader of the Technology Working Group that fed information to the multi-stakeholder regulatory negotiations process (including the [[USEPA]]) which resulted in the adoption of five landmark drinking water regulations:  Interim Surface Water Treatment Rule, Stage 1 Disinfectants and Disinfection Byproducts Rule, Information Collection Rule, Long Term 2 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule and Stage 2 Disinfectants and Disinfection Byproducts Rule.<ref>McGuire, M.J.

McGuire worked for Malcolm Pirnie, Inc. for a little more than three years as a vice president while he managed the [[Santa Monica, California]] office. He managed several major investigations including a demonstration project that showed how chlorite ion could control nitrification, and bench- and pilot-scale projects with [[Glendale, California]] that demonstrated the most cost-effective ways to remove hexavalent chromium from drinking water.\n\nIn August 2008, he left Malcolm Pirnie and opened up a one-man consulting firm, Michael J. McGuire, Inc. He has been providing consulting services in the field of drinking water quality to water utilities and related clients.\n\nFrom 2010 to 2014, he was a lecturer at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] where he taught a course in water treatment plant design. In 2014, he was appointed as Adjunct Professor at UCLA where he continued to teach courses in the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department and the Institute of Environment and Sustainability. From 2014 to 2016, he was the Editor-in-Chief of the ''Journal'' [[American Water Works Association]].\n\nMcGuire is a registered professional engineer in California, Arizona (inactive), Pennsylvania, New Jersey (inactive) and Texas (inactive). He is also a Board Certified Environmental Engineer through the [[American Academy of Environmental Engineers and Scientists]].\n\n==Publications==\n\nMcGuire is a widely published author who has written and presented over 300 professional articles and co-edited five books and collected works. Subject areas for his publications include: treatment plant optimization, activated carbon adsorption of organic compounds, corrosion of distribution system materials, occurrence and control of disinfection byproducts, identification and control of tastes and odors, removal of asbestos fibers, perchlorate removal, control of chloramines and nitrification, removal of hexavalent chromium, compliance with drinking water regulations, oxidation with ozone and PEROXONE and the history of drinking water disinfection.

He has been recognized for his expertise in the control of trace organic and inorganic contaminants and microbial pathogens in water. He is also known for his work in the identification, control and treatment of taste and odor problems in drinking water.  He has published numerous articles in professional journals and he has been the co-editor of five books and compilations of articles.  He published a book that documented the first continuous disinfection of a drinking water supply in the U.S.<ref name=McGuire>McGuire, Michael J. (2013). ''The Chlorine Revolution:  Water Disinfection and the Fight to Save Lives.'' Denver, CO:American Water Works Association.</ref> He has been active in the [[American Water Works Association]], and he has served as a volunteer and officer in that organization. In 2009, he was elected to the [[National Academy of Engineering]].\n\n==Early life and education==\n\nMichael J. McGuire was born in 1947 at Brooke General Army Hospital in [[San Antonio, Texas]].  He attended grammar school in a number of locations, because his father was in the U.S. Army and stationed in several places during McGuire's early years. From 1955 to 1957, McGuire attended the grammar school run for U.S. Army dependents in [[Orleans, France]]. He went to Francis C. Hammond High School in Alexandria, Virginia.<ref>[http://www.hammondhighschool.com/ Francis C. Hammond High School, the Home of the Admirals]</ref>\n\nHe earned his undergraduate degree in civil engineering at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1969. During the period 1970 to 1972, he attended [[Drexel University]] part-time while he worked for the [[Philadelphia Water Department]]. After earning his master's degree in [[Environmental Engineering]] in 1972, he returned to [[Drexel University]] on a full-time basis to study for his PhD degree. He completed his PhD and graduated in 1977.<ref>McGuire, Michael J.

Philadelphia, Pennsylvania:Drexel University.</ref>\n\n==Early career==\n\nMcGuire worked for the [[Philadelphia Water Department]] from 1969 to 1973. Throughout this period, he was assigned to the Research and Development Unit under Joseph V. Radziul.<ref>McGuire, M.J., Suffet, I.H., and Radziul, J.V. (1977). \"The Development of Optimum Unit Processes for the Removal of Trace Organic Compounds from Drinking Water,\" Proceedings Annual Conference American Water Works Association. Anaheim, California.]</ref> He participated in a variety of projects including the supervision of a research program that involved the surveillance of the water quality of the [[Delaware River]] Estuary.  The program required operational supervision of a boat pilot, chemists, engineers, and technicians and the formulation of a data analysis program.  He designed an unusual application of automated water quality analytical equipment aboard a research vessel.<ref>McGuire, M.J. (1972). \"Economic Justification for the Automation of Water Quality Analytical Techniques.\" Advances in Automated Analyses, 4, p. 51.</ref> His other projects included investigation of the availability of future water resources, preparation of testimony given before governmental bodies, and investigation of the effects of urbanization on [[water quality]] and quantity.\n\n==Metropolitan Water District of Southern California==\n\nMcGuire moved to [[California]] in 1977 where he had a two-year stint with the consulting engineering firm, Brown and Caldwell. In 1979, he was offered a position as a water quality engineer with the [[Metropolitan Water District of Southern California]] (Metropolitan). He directed a variety of physical chemical treatment and environmental chemistry projects, and he ran the central water laboratory for Metropolitan. As Water Quality Manager and Director of Water Quality for Metropolitan he supervised the Water Quality Branch and Division, respectively, which grew to a total of 82 scientists, engineers and administrators. During this period he designed a comprehensive research program to determine the cause of earthy musty odor problems in six southern California reservoirs.<ref>McGuire, M.J., Krasner, S.W., Hwang, C.J., and Izaguirre, G. (1983). \"An Early Warning System for Detecting Earthy Musty Odors in Reservoirs.\" Water Science and Technology. 15:6/7, 267 277.</ref> Once the cause was isolated to blue-green algae growing on the bottom of the reservoirs, he devised a methodology to control the growth of the algae and prevent the occurrence of taste and odor problems in the Metropolitan service area.<ref>McGuire, M.J., Jones, R.M., Means, E.G., Izaguirre, G., and Preston, A.E. (1984). \"Controlling Attached Blue Green Algae with Copper Sulfate.\" Jour. AWWA. 76:5, 60 65.</ref> In 1984-85, he managed the conversion of Metropolitan's secondary disinfection system from free chlorine to chloramines.<ref>Kreft, P., Umphres, M., Hand, J. M., Tate, C., McGuire, M.J., and Trussell, R.R. (1985). \"Converting from Chlorine to Chloramines:  A Case Study.\" Jour. AWWA. 77:1, 38 45.</ref>\n\nIn 1990, he became Assistant General Manager at Metropolitan where he was responsible for administration and environmental compliance.  Five divisions reported to him in addition to Metropolitan's Affirmative Action Officer.\n\n==Consulting firms and teaching assignments==\n\nIn 1992, McGuire left Metropolitan and opened a one-man consulting engineering firm\u2014McGuire Environmental Consultants, Inc. (MEC). After five years, he started to grow the firm until it ultimately had 37 employees in three offices: Santa Monica and Newport Beach, California and Denver, Colorado. During the period 1992 to 2000, McGuire was the leader of the Technology Working Group that fed information to the multi-stakeholder regulatory negotiations process (including the [[USEPA]]) which resulted in the adoption of five landmark drinking water regulations:  Interim Surface Water Treatment Rule, Stage 1 Disinfectants and Disinfection Byproducts Rule, Information Collection Rule, Long Term 2 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule and Stage 2 Disinfectants and Disinfection Byproducts Rule.<ref>McGuire, M.J.

McGuire worked for Malcolm Pirnie, Inc. for a little more than three years as a vice president while he managed the [[Santa Monica, California]] office. He managed several major investigations including a demonstration project that showed how chlorite ion could control nitrification, and bench- and pilot-scale projects with [[Glendale, California]] that demonstrated the most cost-effective ways to remove hexavalent chromium from drinking water.\n\nIn August 2008, he left Malcolm Pirnie and opened up a one-man consulting firm, Michael J. McGuire, Inc. He has been providing consulting services in the field of drinking water quality to water utilities and related clients.\n\nFrom 2010 to 2014, he was a lecturer at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] where he taught a course in water treatment plant design. In 2014, he was appointed as Adjunct Professor at UCLA where he continued to teach courses in the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department and the Institute of Environment and Sustainability. From 2014 to 2016, he was the Editor-in-Chief of the ''Journal'' [[American Water Works Association]].\n\nMcGuire is a registered professional engineer in California, Arizona (inactive), Pennsylvania, New Jersey (inactive) and Texas (inactive). He is also a Board Certified Environmental Engineer through the [[American Academy of Environmental Engineers and Scientists]].\n\n==Publications==\n\nMcGuire is a widely published author who has written and presented over 300 professional articles and co-edited five books and collected works. Subject areas for his publications include: treatment plant optimization, activated carbon adsorption of organic compounds, corrosion of distribution system materials, occurrence and control of disinfection byproducts, identification and control of tastes and odors, removal of asbestos fibers, perchlorate removal, control of chloramines and nitrification, removal of hexavalent chromium, compliance with drinking water regulations, oxidation with ozone and PEROXONE and the history of drinking water disinfection.

[[Cuba]] had been [[Cuban War of Independence|waging a war of independence]] against [[Spain]] since 1895, an effort largely supported by the United States, which had extensive economic interests on the island. To ensure the safety of American citizens and property in Cuba, the United States sent the [[battleship]] {{USS|Maine|ACR-1}} to [[Havana]] in late January 1898. The ''Maine'' exploded and was destroyed with large loss of life on February 15, and Spain and the U.S. declared war on each other on April 25.<ref>Trask, p. 57.</ref>\n\nWith only 25,000 men in the [[United States Army]] but more than 100,000 needed to prosecute the war, [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]] convinced [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Russell A. Alger]] that he could raise an all-volunteer force of 1,000 men and form a [[cavalry]] [[Regiment#United States Army|regiment]]. Alger offered Roosevelt a commission in the Army as a full [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] in command of a regular regiment, but Roosevelt declined.<ref name=\"Lansford46\">Lansford, p. 46.</ref> Alger agreed to Roosevelt's volunteer scheme, and Roosevelt resigned his post on May 6, 1898.<ref>Hendrickson, p. 104.</ref> Roosevelt was commissioned a [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] of volunteers and declined command of the regiment (due to his military inexperience) in favor of his friend, Colonel [[Leonard Wood]]. Although formally named the \"1st United States Volunteer Cavalry\", the press nicknamed the regiment the \"Rough Riders\" because most of the men were [[cowboy]]s, [[American frontier|frontiersmen]], [[Rail transport|railroad]] workers, [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], and similar \"rough\" people from the [[American frontier#The term \"West\"|West]].<ref name=\"Lansford46\" />\n\nThe 1,060 Rough Riders departed their training camp in [[San Antonio, Texas]], on May 29, and arrived in [[Santiago de Cuba]], [[Cuba]], on June 19.<ref>Hutton, p. 286-287.</ref> They participated in the [[Battle of Las Guasimas]] on June 24, during which they successfully turned the right flank of a retreating [[Spanish Army]] force with superior weapons and more men.<ref>Hutton, p. 288-290.</ref> On July 1, the regiment participated in the [[Battle of San Juan Hill]], during which it successfully charged Kettle Hill (the famous \"charge up San Juan Hill\") and dislodged another Spanish force with superior firepower.<ref>Hutton, p. 291-294.</ref>\n\n===The first Rough Rider memorials===\n[[File:Monument to the Rough Riders near blockhouse on San Juan Hill - Santiago de Cuba - Cuba - 1910.jpg|thumb|The memorial to the Rough Riders at San Juan Hill near the old Spanish Army blockhouse in 1910.]]\nTwo memorials to the Rough Riders were erected in Cuba shortly after the Spanish\u2013American War ended. One, erected by [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] Wood out of general funds provided for Cuba's military occupation,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=g3rNAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA441# Summers, p. 441-442.] Accessed June 21, 2013.</ref> was erected next to the Spanish Army blockhouse atop San Juan Hill.<ref>Davis, ''Moments in Hell'', p. 72.</ref> This memorial stood on a square concrete base, on the four corners of which were placed artillery shells. A square [[plinth]] with sunk, blank panels on all four sides stood on the base. On the plinth rose a tapered square column with a flat top. Sunk into the face of this column was a bronze plaque, which read: \"In memory of the officers and men of the United States army, who were killed in the assault and capture of this ridge, July 1, 1898, and in the siege of Santiago, July 1 to July 16, 1898. War between Spain and the United States.\"<ref name=\"Passing\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=KQ0DAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA146& Davis, \"The Passing of San Juan Hill\", p. 146, 151.] Accessed June 21, 2013.</ref>\n\nA second memorial, specific to the Rough Riders, was erected at Las Guasimas.<ref name=\"Passing\" /> The provenance of this memorial is not clear. It was shaped much like the one at San Juan Hill although the building materials were much different. This monument was set on a [[flagstone]] base. Rough-hewn pieces of dark grey granite were cemented together to form a rectangular plinth (square in cross-section) atop the flagstones. A tapered square column, made of the same rough-hewn, cemented granite, rose to a flat top. An artillery shell was placed atop the column, and a bronze plaque affixed to its face.  The plaque read: \"In Memory / Of the men of /The First and Tenth United States Cavalry, / Young's Brigade / Wheeler's Division, / Who Were Killed in the / Battle of Las Gu\u00e1simas / June 24th 1898.\"\n\n==Creating the Rough Rider Memorial==\nIt is not clear who first proposed a Rough Rider Memorial, or when the idea was first raised. A Rough Riders National Monument Society was organized on June 15, 1906.<ref name=\"WillHonor\">\"Will Honor Rough Riders.\" ''Washington Post.''

March 28, 1907.</ref>\n\nIt is unclear exactly when approval to erect the Rough Rider Memorial at Arlington National Cemetery was given. The [[Quartermaster Corps (United States Army)|U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps]] had control of Arlington National Cemetery at the time. The erection of a monument would have required the permission of either [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Charles Frederic Humphrey, Sr.|Charles F. Humphrey, Sr.]], the [[Quartermaster General of the United States Army|Quartermaster General]], or Secretary of War [[William Howard Taft]]. But no record of such permission exists. Theodore Roosevelt was sworn in as President of the United States on September 14, 1901, after the death of President [[William McKinley]]. Taft was one of Roosevelt's closest friends. Approval was very unlikely to be denied, and was probably given some time in May or early June 1906. The first fundraiser for the memorial was announced June 10, 1906<ref name=\"SocietyWood\">\"Society.\" ''Washington Post.'' June 10, 1906.</ref>\u2014five days before the society was formally organized.\n\nThe Rough Rider Memorial was designed by Mrs. Capron,<ref name=\"UnveilWaPo\" /> who decided to model the monument on the Rough Riders shaft erected by General Wood in Cuba.<ref name=\"SocietyWood\" /> The bronze tablet on the memorial's face was designed by Major J.T.

[[Cuba]] had been [[Cuban War of Independence|waging a war of independence]] against [[Spain]] since 1895, an effort largely supported by the United States, which had extensive economic interests on the island. To ensure the safety of American citizens and property in Cuba, the United States sent the [[battleship]] {{USS|Maine|ACR-1}} to [[Havana]] in late January 1898. The ''Maine'' exploded and was destroyed with large loss of life on February 15, and Spain and the U.S. declared war on each other on April 25.<ref>Trask, p. 57.</ref>\n\nWith only 25,000 men in the [[United States Army]] but more than 100,000 needed to prosecute the war, [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]] convinced [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Russell A. Alger]] that he could raise an all-volunteer force of 1,000 men and form a [[cavalry]] [[Regiment#United States Army|regiment]]. Alger offered Roosevelt a commission in the Army as a full [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] in command of a regular regiment, but Roosevelt declined.<ref name=\"Lansford46\">Lansford, p. 46.</ref> Alger agreed to Roosevelt's volunteer scheme, and Roosevelt resigned his post on May 6, 1898.<ref>Hendrickson, p. 104.</ref> Roosevelt was commissioned a [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] of volunteers and declined command of the regiment (due to his military inexperience) in favor of his friend, Colonel [[Leonard Wood]]. Although formally named the \"1st United States Volunteer Cavalry\", the press nicknamed the regiment the \"Rough Riders\" because most of the men were [[cowboy]]s, [[American frontier|frontiersmen]], [[Rail transport|railroad]] workers, [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], and similar \"rough\" people from the [[American frontier#The term \"West\"|West]].<ref name=\"Lansford46\" />\n\nThe 1,060 Rough Riders departed their training camp in [[San Antonio, Texas]], on May 29, and arrived in [[Santiago de Cuba]], [[Cuba]], on June 19.<ref>Hutton, p. 286-287.</ref> They participated in the [[Battle of Las Guasimas]] on June 24, during which they successfully turned the right flank of a retreating [[Spanish Army]] force with superior weapons and more men.<ref>Hutton, p. 288-290.</ref> On July 1, the regiment participated in the [[Battle of San Juan Hill]], during which it successfully charged Kettle Hill (the famous \"charge up San Juan Hill\") and dislodged another Spanish force with superior firepower.<ref>Hutton, p. 291-294.</ref>\n\n===The first Rough Rider memorials===\n[[File:Monument to the Rough Riders near blockhouse on San Juan Hill - Santiago de Cuba - Cuba - 1910.jpg|thumb|The memorial to the Rough Riders at San Juan Hill near the old Spanish Army blockhouse in 1910.]]\nTwo memorials to the Rough Riders were erected in Cuba shortly after the Spanish\u2013American War ended.

A square [[plinth]] with sunk, blank panels on all four sides stood on the base. On the plinth rose a tapered square column with a flat top. Sunk into the face of this column was a bronze plaque, which read: \"In memory of the officers and men of the United States army, who were killed in the assault and capture of this ridge, July 1, 1898, and in the siege of Santiago, July 1 to July 16, 1898.

It was shaped much like the one at San Juan Hill although the building materials were much different. This monument was set on a [[flagstone]] base. Rough-hewn pieces of dark grey granite were cemented together to form a rectangular plinth (square in cross-section) atop the flagstones. A tapered square column, made of the same rough-hewn, cemented granite, rose to a flat top. An artillery shell was placed atop the column, and a bronze plaque affixed to its face.  The plaque read: \"In Memory / Of the men of /The First and Tenth United States Cavalry, / Young's Brigade / Wheeler's Division, / Who Were Killed in the / Battle of Las Gu\u00e1simas / June 24th 1898.\"\n\n==Creating the Rough Rider Memorial==\nIt is not clear who first proposed a Rough Rider Memorial, or when the idea was first raised.

The [[Quartermaster Corps (United States Army)|U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps]] had control of Arlington National Cemetery at the time. The erection of a monument would have required the permission of either [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Charles Frederic Humphrey, Sr.|Charles F.

Theodore Roosevelt was sworn in as President of the United States on September 14, 1901, after the death of President [[William McKinley]]. Taft was one of Roosevelt's closest friends. Approval was very unlikely to be denied, and was probably given some time in May or early June 1906.

See: \"Rough Riders' Shaft.\" ''Washington Post.'' March 28, 1907.</ref> In design, it is very similar to the Rough Rider monument erected at Las Guasimas in Cuba.<ref name=\"RRShaft\" /> The [[obelisk]]-like memorial is rough-hewn everywhere, except for the panels on the north, south, and east faces where the names of the dead are carved.<ref name=\"UnveilWaPo\" />\n\nNear the top of the front (western face) of the memorial is a smooth bar of granite, on which the words \"ROUGH RIDERS'\" is carved in [[Relief#Bas-relief or low relief|bas-relief]].<ref name=\"UnveilNYT\" /> Below this is a rectangular dark bronze plaque whose edges are ornamented with [[Laurel wreath|laurel leaves]] (a symbol of victory). At the top of the plaque is a bar which bears the name of the regiment (\"1st. U.S. Vol. Cav.\"). Below that are outspread wings, over which two [[sabre]]s are crossed. Appearing to hang from the sabres is the regimental insignia. An \"RR\" (for Rough Riders\") is inscribed on the insignia, and the name of the three major battles in which the unit fought (Las Guasimas, San Juan Hill, Santiago) ring the emblem.<ref name=\"WillHonor\" />\n\nThe text on tablet reads:<ref name=\"UnveilNYT\" /><ref name=\"RRShaft\" />\n:In memory of \n:The deceased members\n:of the 1st U.S.\n:Volunteer Cavalry,\n:Spanish\u2013American War\n:Erected by the members and \n:friends of the regiment.\n:1906.\n\nAt the time of its unveiling, the names of more than 100 men had been cut into it.<ref name=\"UnveilWaPo\" />\n\nThe total cost of the Rough Riders Memorial was $2,500 (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|2500|1907}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars).<ref name=\"WillHonor\" />\n\nThe Rough Rider Monument Society planned to have the names of members of the regiment inscribed on the monument as they died,<ref name=\"RRShaft\" /> and established a self-sustaining fund to pay for this.<ref name=\"WillHonor\" /> The raising of money for the inscription fund continued long after the memorial's dedication. The monument society owed more than $1,000 (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|1000|1907}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars) for construction of the memorial.<ref name=\"Donates\">\"President Donates $100.\" ''Washington Post.''
