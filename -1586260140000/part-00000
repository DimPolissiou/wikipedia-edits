During the break a twenty-two track singles, b-sides and rarities compilation simply titled ''[[Tullycraft - The Singles|The Singles]]'' was released on [[Darla Records]] in late 1999.\n\n===''Beat Surf Fun''===\nFollowing a hiatus that lasted most of 2000, the band started the writing process for what would become their third full length album, ''Beat Surf Fun''. Recording commenced in 2001 at a rehearsal space in [[Ballard, Washington]]. Harold Hollingsworth was recruited to take over lead guitar duties. Hollingsworth had played with the band briefly in 1997 on a U.S. tour.\n\nThe third album, ''[[Beat Surf Fun]]'' was released on Magic Marker Records in 2002. The album included the singles \"Wild Bikini\" and \"Twee\". In 2003, Tullycraft played shows in England, Sweden, Norway, and the Netherlands in support of the ''Beat Surf Fun'' album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://threeimaginarygirls.com/imaginaryboytullycrafttourdiary-asp/|title=Tullycraft Tour Diary - Three Imaginary Girls|website=Threeimaginarygirls.com|accessdate=12 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n===''Disenchanted Hearts Unite''===\nIn 2004, the band began working on what would be their fourth full length album, ''[[Disenchanted Hearts Unite]]''. Just prior to the album's release, guitarist Harold Hollingsworth left the band.\n\nOn May 3, 2005 ''[[Disenchanted Hearts Unite]]'' was released on Magic Marker Records. The band re-emerged with a new line-up that included Corianton Hale (lead guitar) and Jenny Mears (vocals). Some critics consider the album to be the band's finest.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sendra |first=Tim |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/disenchanted-hearts-unite-mw0000141658 |title=Disenchanted Hearts Unite - Tullycraft : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date=2005-05-03 |accessdate=2013-05-13}}</ref> Although Tullycraft did not embark on a full U.S. tour to promote ''Disenchanted Hearts Unite'', they did play a number of universities, the occasional pop festival, and the [[SXSW]] music festival in Austin, Texas in 2006 and 2007.<ref>[http://www.tullycraftnation.com/pressroom.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090510232828/http://www.tullycraftnation.com/pressroom.html |date=May 10, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n===''Every Scene Needs A Center''===\nOn October 23, 2007 the fifth full length album, ''[[Every Scene Needs A Center]]'' was released on Magic Marker Records. The band spent over a year working on the album, splitting time between their own recording studio and Soundhouse Studio in Seattle, Washington. Described as a vampire indie-pop opera, the album included the singles \"The Punks Are Writing Love Songs\" and \"Georgette Plays A Goth.\" In 2015 Magic Marker Records reissued ''Every Scene Needs a Center'' on limited edition vinyl.\n\n===''Lost in Light Rotation''===\nAfter a three year hiatus the band began working on a new album during the summer of 2012. Recording began with Pete Remine at Dubtrain Studio in Seattle. The songs were mixed at Avast Recording Co. with producer [[Phil Ek]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philek.com/chronological.html|title=PHIL EK - Producer \u00b7 Engineer \u00b7 Mixer|website=Philek.com|accessdate=12 March 2019}}</ref> The result was the band\u2019s sixth album, ''[[Lost in Light Rotation]]'' - the first Tullycraft full-length since 2007's ''Every Scene Needs a Center''. The album received some of the best press in the band\u2019s career.\n\nIn January 2013 [[Fortuna Pop!]] released a 7\" of the title track, \"[[Tullycraft - Lost in Light Rotation 7\"|Lost in Light Rotation]]\", as the first single from the forthcoming LP. The album was co-released in April 2013 by Magic Marker Records and [[Fortuna Pop!]]\n\n===''The Railway Prince Hotel''===\nDuring the summer of 2017 Tullycraft regrouped and started recording what would become their seventh full-length studio album, [[The Railway Prince Hotel]]. As with their previous record, ''Lost in Light Rotation'', the album was recorded and engineered by Pete Remine at Dubtrain Studio in Seattle, WA. After the release of a video for the song \u201cPassing Observations\u201d in December 2018, ''The Railway Prince Hotel'' was released on [[Happy Happy Birthday to Me Records]] on February 8, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brooklynvegan.com/tullycraft-prep-first-lp-in-six-years-watch-the-passing-observations-video/|title=Tullycraft prep first LP in six years (watch the \"Passing Observations\" video)|website=BrooklynVegan.com|accessdate=12 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Live===\nAfter years of touring fairly consistently, in 2009 Tullycraft stopped playing live.  On May 23, 2009 they performed in San Francisco, California. This was billed as the last show the band would play before taking a break from performing live. They have not played live in public since.<ref>[http://www.thestranger.com/lineout/archives/2009/04/05/tullycrafts-last-seattle-show-at-the-new-crocodile] {{dead link|date=March 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Film===\nIn 2001, Tullycraft was featured alongside [[Sleater-Kinney]], [[Henry's Dress]], [[Dub Narcotic Sound System]], [[Unwound]] and [[The Make-Up]] in the Justin Mitchell music documentary, ''Songs for Cassavetes''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107160903/http://www.thebreadcrumbtrail.com/|title=the > breadcrumb > trail|date=7 January 2010|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=12 March 2019}}</ref> The song \"Pop Songs Your New Boyfriend\u2019s Too Stupid To Know About\" was used in the film's opening credits.\n\n===Tribute albums===\n* In 2003 a 22-song tribute album titled, ''[[First String Teenage High: The Songs of Tullycraft Played By People Who Aren't]]'' was released on AAJ/Bumblebear Records.\n* In 2010 ''[[Wish I'd Kept A Scrapbook: A Tribute to Tullycraft]]'' was released on Unchikun Records.

Wreck Cove makes up half of that hydro capacity, making it a key provider of reliable, renewable energy needed to complement and back up the 600 MW of clean \u2013 but unpredictable \u2013 [[wind power]] on the province's electrical system. The Wreck Cove hydroelectric facility is the only one in the province that can go from zero to full output in under 10 minutes.<ref name=\"Tour\">{{cite news |last1=McNeil |first1=Greg |title=Public heads underground to tour Wreck Cove Hydro facility |url=https://www.saltwire.com/news/local/public-heads-underground-to-tour-wreck-cove-hydro-facility-9466/ |accessdate=5 April 2020 |work=Cape Breton Post |publisher=SaltWire Network |date=7 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Purpose==\nWreck Cove primary purpose is to generate electricity, to supply Nova Scotia Powers' [[electrical grid]], but the unique nature of the installation also allows Wreck Cove to play a critical role in NS Power\u2019s ability to meet the reliability standards defined by [[North American Electric Reliability Corporation]] (NERC) and [[Northeast Power Coordinating Council]] (NPCC) and also provides other Grid Reliability Services:\n\n===NERC/NPCC requirements===\n\n====Black Start Requirements====\nUnder NERC, Nove Scotia Power must maintain multiple [[black start]] pathways to re-start the grid should a black-out ever occur. Wreck Cove is one of the two pathways Nova Scotia Power uses to meet this NERC requirement.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n====Planning Reserve Margin====\nNova Scotia Power must maintain sufficient capacity to serve its [[peak load]] as well as additional capacity for the planning reserve margin (PRM). The PRM acts as a resource to respond to a contingency to ensure customer load can be served in the event unexpected generation restrictions or supply requirements arise. For example, the PRM capacity ensures adequate generation in the event that one or more generation resources are unavailable or cannot run at full capacity at the time of system peak. Planning reserves also account for uncertainties in demand forecasting and resource availability. The Wreck Cove system contributes approximately 8 percent towards NS Power\u2019s total required capacity in 2020, assuming a PRM of 20 percent.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n====Operating Reserve Capacity Requirements (10 min reserve)====\nNERC/NPCC requires electric utilities to have their largest single energy production source covered by an alternative source in reserve capacity. Currently, NS Power\u2019s largest single unit is [[Point Aconi Generating Station]] which produces 168 MW of operating capacity. Wreck Cove Units 1 and 2 have an accredited capability of 106 MW each unit (212 MW total), making this facility an important provider of this service. As such, the reliable operation of the Wreck Cove Generating Station provides Nova Scotia Power\u2019s ability to meet this requirement. NPCC also requires that operating reserve capacity be available and on the grid within 10 minutes. If Wreck Cove\u2019s Units 1 and 2 are off-line, they can be brought onto the grid and reach full capacity within the 10-minute requirement.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n====Tie-Line Regulation====\nWreck Cove assists with providing tie-line regulation. Nova Scotia Power is required to have reserve capacity available for changes in demand across the tie-line to [[New Brunswick]]. Because Wreck Cove is capable of changing its output at the rate of 20 MW/min, it is more effective in responding to fluctuations in Nova Scotia system load and wind generation than slower acting thermal generation sources, which can be moved at a rate of 0.5 MW to 2 MW per minute.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n===Energy Balancing and Wind Following===\nWreck Cove 1 has been utilized in recent years as a means of balancing energy generation throughout the cycles associated with wind generation. Nova Scotia Power\u2019s hydroelectric generation provides load/wind following services, meaning that the hydroelectric generation is dispatchable and can be used to mitigate the impacts resulting from the high variability of wind generation resources and associated forecasting variations. Although wind following was not the original intent for the use of Wreck Cove, having the ability to utilize Wreck Cove in this way has supported the development and integration of wind generation on the grid. This service is related to the Tie-Line Regulation discussed above, but over a longer time frame. The flexibility of Wreck Cove\u2019s load response is also critical to managing periods of short term, large scale load changes (pickup and drop-off) from industrial customers on the grid.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n===Grid Reliability Services===\n\n====Load Shaving Capacity====\nWreck Cove provides critical peak load shaving capacity for the short periods of high load that occur daily, typically during morning and evening peak hours. Given Wreck Cove can be brought on-line quickly for these periods of high load ramping, thermal generation resources which cannot be cycled off-and-on frequently can be more economically dispatched.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n====Scheduling and Dispatch====\nWreck Cove is a source of 212 MW of stored power for Nova Scotia Power to use when needed. It can operate at maximum power for 4-6 hours depending on conditions, at which time it needs to allow water from farther upstream in the watershed to make its way to Surge Lake.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n====Reactive Supply and Voltage Control====\nNova Scotia Power\u2019s 33 hydro plants/50 hydro units provide 180 MVar of dynamic reactive power to the system. The Nova Scotia Power System Operator controls generators to absorb or produce reactive power to control system voltage. Wreck Cove is located at the eastern end of the transmission grid and therefore its ability to support load is less important than generation closer to the load centre; however, due to its relative size, its dynamic reactive power contributes to stabilizing the grid following disturbances.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n====Primary Frequency Response====\nWreck Cove, like all hydro and thermal generators, is equipped with speed governors which maintain the scheduled grid frequency of 60 Hz. It provides a significant contribution to system inertia, which stabilizes the grid frequency during disturbances.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n====System Strength====\nHydro generation contributes to system inertia, which allows the system to ride through fault conditions, and short circuit strength, which provides the high fault current levels needed to activate system protection devices (inverter-based wind, tidal and solar do not materially contribute to this).<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n==Construction==\nBetween 1975 and 1978, more than 2.5 million cubic metres of rock were blasted and removed to construct the facility\u2019s 11 major [[dam]]s and associated wing dams.  All are [[Dam#Earth-fill_dams|earth dams]] or [[Dam#Rock-fill_dams|rockfill dams]] with an impervious material in the middle (the core dam), with filter material at both sides and rockfill on each dam for stability.<ref name=\"Investigation\">{{cite journal |last1=Caplan |first1=Ronald |title=Wreck Cove Hydro-Electric Investigation |journal=Cape Breton's Magazine |date=1 October 1974 |issue=9 |pages=1-12 |url=http://capebretonsmagazine.com/modules/publisher/item.php?itemid=243 |accessdate=5 April 2020 |publisher=Breton Books |location=Wreck Cove, NS |issn=0319-4639 |oclc=1941799}}</ref>\n\nThe development involved the diversion of seven headwater streams, including Indian Brook, West Indian Brook and MacMillan's Brook, Wreck Cove River, MacLeod's Brook, the Ingonish River and the headwaters of [[Ch\u00e9ticamp River]].

The water then enters the Wreck Cove Flowage Reservoir, and then travels via T2, a {{convert|610|m|ft}} long {{convert|3.65|m|ft}} diameter tunnel, to the head pond, Surge Lake. A blasted, concrete lined penstock, {{convert|3.65|m|ft}} in diameter, then carries water down {{convert|365|m|ft}} to the base of the power house, where it transitions into the bifurcation and steel lined horizontal penstocks. These deliver the high pressure water to the two {{convert|2|m|ft}} diameter spherical turbine inlet shutoff valves ([[Dominion Engineering Works]]) that feed into Wreck Cove's two vertical 101 [[Megawatt|MW]] [[francis turbine]] ([[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries|Mitsubishi Motors]]) generator units at an elevation of {{convert|.3|m|ft}} above sea level.<ref name=\"IRP\"/><ref name=\"refit\"/>\n\nThe centerline of the generators are very close to zero elevation at {{convert|2.5|m|ft}} above sea level.

It literally looks like a James Bond villain's lair.\"\n\n==Refurbishment==\nWreck Cove underwent a $13.5 million refurbishment in 2015-16, the first major work to take place there since its construction.<ref name=\"modernization\"/> This work included some of the reservoirs and dams, with a $5.8-million refurbishment to ensure updated national dam guidelines were met. Crews striped away the riprap, which is a man-made barrier of rocks that protects the dam, and doubled its thickness to six feet to ensure it can withstand large waves that could be generated in a severe storm. The project also involved raising the dam by {{convert|1|m|ft}}. The refurbishment is expected to extend the life of the dam by 70 years.<ref name=\"refit\"/>\n\n==Modernisation==\nNova Scotia Power Inc. has applied for approval from the provincial regulator, the [[Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board]], for a $110-million life extension and modernization (LEM) of the hydroelectric facility. The work proposed would be the first and larger component of a two-phase project. The current project would include replacing the two Wreck Cove [[Electric generator|generator]] units; refurbishing the two [[turbine]] units, which includes replacing the turbine runners; refurbishing the spherical valves; and upgrading the penstock intake at Surge Lake.  The project will increase the flexible operating range of the units and it is estimated it will increase Wreck Cove system annual generation from 300 GWh to a forecast 315 GWh.<ref name=\"NSURB\">{{cite book |title=Wreck Cove Life Extension and Modernization - Unit Rehabilitation and Replacement |date=28 February 2020 |publisher=Nova Scotia Power Incorporated |quote=Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board IN THE MATTER OF The Public Utilities Act, R.S.N.S. 1989, c.380, as amended - Nova Scotia Power Incorporated Wreck Cove Life Extension and Modernization - Unit Rehabilitation and Replacement}}</ref>\n\nThe second phase would primarily involve the rehabilitation of the station breakers and [[switchgear]], and the replacement of the cooling water systems at the plant, as well as plant system upgrades.<ref name=\"modernization\"/><ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\nThe objective of the LEM initiative is to enable the Wreck Cove Generating station to continue to provide renewable generation and system stability for the next 40 years.

The Wreck Cove system contributes approximately 8 percent towards NS Power\u2019s total required capacity in 2020, assuming a PRM of 20 percent.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n====Operating Reserve Capacity Requirements (10 min reserve)====\nNERC/NPCC requires electric utilities to have their largest single energy production source covered by an alternative source in reserve capacity. Currently, NS Power\u2019s largest single unit is [[Point Aconi Generating Station]] which produces 168 MW of operating capacity. Wreck Cove Units 1 and 2 have an accredited capability of 106 MW each unit (212 MW total), making this facility an important provider of this service. As such, the reliable operation of the Wreck Cove Generating Station provides Nova Scotia Power\u2019s ability to meet this requirement. NPCC also requires that operating reserve capacity be available and on the grid within 10 minutes. If Wreck Cove\u2019s Units 1 and 2 are off-line, they can be brought onto the grid and reach full capacity within the 10-minute requirement.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n====Tie-Line Regulation====\nWreck Cove assists with providing tie-line regulation. Nova Scotia Power is required to have reserve capacity available for changes in demand across the tie-line to [[New Brunswick]]. Because Wreck Cove is capable of changing its output at the rate of 20 MW/min, it is more effective in responding to fluctuations in Nova Scotia system load and wind generation than slower acting thermal generation sources, which can be moved at a rate of 0.5 MW to 2 MW per minute.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n===Energy Balancing and Wind Following===\nWreck Cove 1 has been utilized in recent years as a means of balancing energy generation throughout the cycles associated with wind generation. Nova Scotia Power\u2019s hydroelectric generation provides load/wind following services, meaning that the hydroelectric generation is dispatchable and can be used to mitigate the impacts resulting from the high variability of wind generation resources and associated forecasting variations. Although wind following was not the original intent for the use of Wreck Cove, having the ability to utilize Wreck Cove in this way has supported the development and integration of wind generation on the grid. This service is related to the Tie-Line Regulation discussed above, but over a longer time frame. The flexibility of Wreck Cove\u2019s load response is also critical to managing periods of short term, large scale load changes (pickup and drop-off) from industrial customers on the grid.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n===Grid Reliability Services===\n\n====Load Shaving Capacity====\nWreck Cove provides critical peak load shaving capacity for the short periods of high load that occur daily, typically during morning and evening peak hours. Given Wreck Cove can be brought on-line quickly for these periods of high load ramping, thermal generation resources which cannot be cycled off-and-on frequently can be more economically dispatched.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n====Scheduling and Dispatch====\nWreck Cove is a source of 212 MW of stored power for Nova Scotia Power to use when needed. It can operate at maximum power for 4-6 hours depending on conditions, at which time it needs to allow water from farther upstream in the watershed to make its way to Surge Lake.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n====Reactive Supply and Voltage Control====\nNova Scotia Power\u2019s 33 hydro plants/50 hydro units provide 180 MVar of dynamic reactive power to the system. The Nova Scotia Power System Operator controls generators to absorb or produce reactive power to control system voltage. Wreck Cove is located at the eastern end of the transmission grid and therefore its ability to support load is less important than generation closer to the load centre; however, due to its relative size, its dynamic reactive power contributes to stabilizing the grid following disturbances.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n====Primary Frequency Response====\nWreck Cove, like all hydro and thermal generators, is equipped with speed governors which maintain the scheduled grid frequency of 60 Hz. It provides a significant contribution to system inertia, which stabilizes the grid frequency during disturbances.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n====System Strength====\nHydro generation contributes to system inertia, which allows the system to ride through fault conditions, and short circuit strength, which provides the high fault current levels needed to activate system protection devices (inverter-based wind, tidal and solar do not materially contribute to this).<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n==Construction==\nBetween 1975 and 1978, more than 2.5 million cubic metres of rock were blasted and removed to construct the facility\u2019s 11 major [[dam]]s and associated wing dams.  All are [[Dam#Earth-fill_dams|earth dams]] or [[Dam#Rock-fill_dams|rockfill dams]] with an impervious material in the middle (the core dam), with filter material at both sides and rockfill on each dam for stability.<ref name=\"Investigation\">{{cite journal |last1=Caplan |first1=Ronald |title=Wreck Cove Hydro-Electric Investigation |journal=Cape Breton's Magazine |date=1 October 1974 |issue=9 |pages=1-12 |url=http://capebretonsmagazine.com/modules/publisher/item.php?itemid=243 |accessdate=5 April 2020 |publisher=Breton Books |location=Wreck Cove, NS |issn=0319-4639 |oclc=1941799}}</ref>\n\nThe development involved the diversion of seven headwater streams, including Indian Brook, West Indian Brook and MacMillan's Brook, Wreck Cove River, MacLeod's Brook, the Ingonish River and the headwaters of [[Ch\u00e9ticamp River]].

The water then enters the Wreck Cove Flowage Reservoir, and then travels via T2, a {{convert|610|m|ft}} long {{convert|3.65|m|ft}} diameter tunnel, to the head pond, Surge Lake. A blasted, concrete lined penstock, {{convert|3.65|m|ft}} in diameter, then carries water down {{convert|365|m|ft}} to the base of the power house, where it transitions into the bifurcation and steel lined horizontal penstocks.

The work proposed would be the first and larger component of a two-phase project. The current project would include replacing the two Wreck Cove [[Electric generator|generator]] units; refurbishing the two [[turbine]] units, which includes replacing the turbine runners; refurbishing the spherical valves; and upgrading the penstock intake at Surge Lake.  The project will increase the flexible operating range of the units and it is estimated it will increase Wreck Cove system annual generation from 300 GWh to a forecast 315 GWh.<ref name=\"NSURB\">{{cite book |title=Wreck Cove Life Extension and Modernization - Unit Rehabilitation and Replacement |date=28 February 2020 |publisher=Nova Scotia Power Incorporated |quote=Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board IN THE MATTER OF The Public Utilities Act, R.S.N.S. 1989, c.380, as amended - Nova Scotia Power Incorporated Wreck Cove Life Extension and Modernization - Unit Rehabilitation and Replacement}}</ref>\n\nThe second phase would primarily involve the rehabilitation of the station breakers and [[switchgear]], and the replacement of the cooling water systems at the plant, as well as plant system upgrades.<ref name=\"modernization\"/><ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\nThe objective of the LEM initiative is to enable the Wreck Cove Generating station to continue to provide renewable generation and system stability for the next 40 years.

It was the third television station to sign-on in Detroit after WWJ-TV (channel 4, now [[WDIV-TV]]) and [[WXYZ-TV]] (channel 7) - all of which have signed on in a 14-month timeframe. Despite Detroit being a major television market, it only accommodated three VHF allocations due to being shortspaced between [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]] ([[WJRT-TV|channel 12]]) and [[Saginaw, Michigan|Saginaw]] ([[WNEM-TV|channel 5]]) to the north; [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]] (channels [[WLNS-TV|6]] and [[WILX-TV|10]]) to the west; [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]] (channels [[WTOL|11]] and [[WTVG|13]]) to the south; and [[Cleveland]] (channels [[WKYC|3]], [[WEWS-TV|5]] and [[WJW (TV)|8]]);Windsor, Ontario ([[CBET-DT|channel 9]]); and [[London, Ontario]] ([[CFPL-DT|channel 10]]); to the east. For this reason, WJBK was assigned the final VHF channel in Detroit.\n\nAt sign on, the first program broadcast by WJBK was a presentation of ''Lucky Pup'' at 6:15&nbsp;p.m. that evening.<ref name=\"dettv\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/vintagedetroittvandmovieboard/?sid=60bd02e21d21fd4a42d4733064c8e95c|title=Keith Milford's Vintage Detroit TV and Movie Board|website=Keith Milford's Vintage Detroit TV and Movie Board}}</ref> The station was originally an [[network affiliate|affiliate]] of both [[CBS]] and the [[DuMont Television Network]]. It was originally owned by Fort Industry Broadcasting, owned by George B. Storer and then based in nearby Toledo, Ohio. Fort Industry, which would later be renamed [[Storer Communications|Storer Broadcasting]], also owned WJBK radio (1500 AM, now [[WLQV]], and 93.1 FM, now [[WDRQ]]). The station originally operated from Detroit's [[Detroit Masonic Temple|Masonic Temple]] until 1956, when its operations were moved to a [[WJBK-TV Studios Building|purpose-built studio facility]] on Second Avenue in [[New Center, Detroit|Detroit's New Center]] section. WJBK-TV would eventually become an exclusive CBS affiliate by 1955, when Windsor, Ontario-based CKLW-TV (channel 9, now [[CBC Television|CBC]] O&O CBET-DT) became a DuMont affiliate. WJBK first broadcast in color around 1956.

In 1985, the [[private equity firm|equity firm]] [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts]] (KKR) acquired Storer Communications, Incorporated in a [[leveraged buyout]]. Storer spurned offers from Knight-Ridder Newspapers, Tele-Communications, Inc and Scripps Howard Broadcasting Co., though Scripps Howard would successfully acquire cross-town rival ABC owned and operated station WXYZ-TV in 1986 after the ABC-Capital Cities Communications merger was approved by federal regulators. KKR then sold all of the Storer broadcast assets, including WJBK, to [[George N. Gillett, Jr.|Gillett Communications]] in 1987, after an attempt to sell the stations to [[Lorimar-Telepictures]] in 1986 failed. When Gillett went [[Bankruptcy in the United States|bankrupt]] in 1992, it reorganized the ownership of its television stations into SCI Television. The following year, in 1993, a few other station owners\u2014Federal Broadcasting, owners of [[WWJ (AM)]]/[[WXYT-FM|FM]]; [[Westinghouse Broadcasting|Group W]]; and CBS\u2014showed interest in the station.

WXYZ and Cleveland sister station WEWS-TV were both heavily wooed to become CBS affiliates, but the E. W. Scripps Company signed an affiliation deal with ABC in June 1994 that renewed the network's affiliations with both stations and resulted in [[WMAR-TV|three]] [[WFTS-TV|other]] [[KNXV|stations]] switching to that network. WDIV was later eliminated due to that station's long-term affiliation contract with NBC. As a result, CBS was forced to deal with the market's lower-rated [[ultra high frequency|UHF]] outlets, none of which had the kind of signal penetration that WJBK had. As a contingency plan, CBS signed a long-term affiliation deal with [[WTOL]] in Toledo, Ohio; which provides city-grade coverage to most of Detroit's southern suburbs and grade B coverage of Detroit itself. It also persuaded Mid-Michigan's longtime NBC affiliate, WNEM-TV, to switch to CBS; WNEM provided stronger coverage of Detroit's outer northern suburbs than did the market's longtime CBS affiliate, [[WEYI-TV]]. It also convinced WLNS-TV in Lansing to build a translator in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]]. The main WLNS signal provided at least grade B coverage to many of Detroit's western suburbs.\n\nWith just days to go before WJBK was due to switch to Fox, CBS faced the prospect of having to import WTOL, WNEM, and WLNS on area cable providers until it could find a replacement affiliate. CBS would end up purchasing low-rated UHF [[Independent station (North America)|independent station]] WGPR-TV (channel 62, now [[WWJ-TV]]) in September 1994. The last CBS network program to air on WJBK was a first-run episode of ''[[Walker, Texas Ranger]]'' at 10:00&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]] on December 10, 1994; channel 2 officially became a Fox affiliate the next day, when the network's programming lineup moved to the station from WKBD; the first Fox network program to air on the station as a full-time affiliate was ''[[Fox NFL Sunday]]'' at noon that day, which led into that afternoon's NFL doubleheader: an early game between the [[1994 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] and the [[1994 Los Angeles Rams season|Los Angeles Rams]] and a mid-afternoon game between the [[1994 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] and the [[1994 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego Chargers]]. Former Fox affiliate WKBD briefly became an independent station before becoming a charter affiliate of [[UPN]] in January 1995.\n\nUntil channel 62 built a new transmitter in 1999, WTOL served as the default CBS affiliate for most of the southern portion of the market, while WNEM served the northern portion and WLNS served the western portion.\n\nAs a result of the network switch, WJBK changed its branding from \"TV 2\" to \"Fox 2\" by the fall of 1995<ref name=\"michg\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.michiguide.com/dials/tv/wjbk.html?fb_xd_fragment#?=&cb=f1aa664e264b8b8&relation=parent&transport=fragment&frame=f3524f805d65c8c&error=unknown_user|title=WJBK TV Channel 2 Detroit - Michiguide.com Dials (TV)|website=www.michiguide.com}}</ref> (becoming one of the few New World stations that switched to the network to adhere to the network's branding conventions before Fox's buyout of New World).

[[Broadcast syndication|Syndicated]] programs currently seen on WJBK include ''[[Judge Judy]]'', ''[[Dish Nation]]'', ''[[The Wendy Williams Show]]'', ''[[TMZ on TV]]'', and ''[[Extra (American TV program)|Extra]]'', among others.\n\n===Local productions===\nSome of WJBK's early productions included popular children's shows. ''Milky's Movie Party'' starring Milky the [[Clown]], played by magician Clarence R. Cummings, Jr., was one of the station's first locally produced children's programs from 1950 to 1955. The program featured a mix of [[animated cartoon|cartoons]] and [[Western (genre)|westerns]] with Cummings performing magic tricks with other acts in front of a live audience. Cummings would eventually take the Milky character to WXYZ-TV and the former WWJ-TV (now WDIV).<ref name=\"soupy\">Kiska, Tim. From Soupy to Nuts: A History of Detroit Television. 2005.

Hunt with his sidekick [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]] Bongo Bailey hosted cartoons and taught viewers about various wildlife.

The hour-long show included games, contests, and interviews with the biggest stars of the time including [[Lucille Ball]] and [[Red Skelton]]. Bergeson also hosted other WJBK shows in the 1950s including ''Your TV Golf Pro'' and ''The Name Game''.<ref name=\"soupy\"/> From 1967 to 1983, [[Sir Graves Ghastly]], played by actor [[Lawson J. Deming]], hosted WJBK's assorted sci-fi and [[horror film|horror movies]] on Saturday afternoons; the humorous character became a popular figure in Detroit television. Deming had originally come to the station as a [[puppet]]eer and voice actor for the children's program ''[[Woodrow the Woodsman]]'' when that show moved from Cleveland's WKYC-TV to WJBK in 1966. In addition to playing the character in Cleveland, he also played Sir Graves on [[WUSA (TV)|WTOP-TV]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] at the same time.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.sirgravesghastly.com/ |title=Sir Graves Ghastly Official Site |access-date=September 6, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160215113436/http://www.sirgravesghastly.com/ |archive-date=February 15, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n''With This Ring'' was a nationally syndicated [[religious broadcasting|religious]] program produced at the studios of WJBK from the early 1970s through the mid-1990s. The weekly 15-minute show hosted by [[Roman Catholic]] priest Raymond Schlinkert featured lectures and advice about marriage and family life. The program was syndicated to several other U.S. commercial stations, usually shown immediately following the station's sign-on or before sign-off on Sundays.\n\nWJBK would also produce Sunday [[public affairs (broadcasting)|public affairs]]/interview shows over the years including ''Focus Detroit'', hosted by reporters Woody Willis and Beverly Payne in 1973;<ref name=\"toledo\">{{Cite web|url=https://vintagetoledotv.com/|title=vintage toledo tv|website=Vinatge Toledo TV}}</ref> ''Sunday in Detroit'', hosted by news anchor Kathy O'Brien, would air around 1980 and WJBK business reporter and news anchor Murray Feldman also hosted a Sunday business and financial program in the mid-1990s called ''Moneywise''. WJBK produced a local version of the syndicated program ''[[PM Magazine]]'' from 1978 to the mid-1980s. The show changed titles over the years eventually becoming known as ''PM Detroit'' \u2013 it also had various hosts included Ronnie Klemmer, Lorrie Kapp, Gary Cubberly and Mattie Majors.<ref name=\"toledo\"/> The station was also the Detroit home and active participant for comedian [[Jerry Lewis]]' annual ''[[Muscular Dystrophy Association|MDA]] [[MDA Labor Day Telethon|Labor Day Telethon]]'' for several years.\n\nFrom 1983 to 1986, popular [[WJR]] (760 AM) morning radio host [[J. P. McCarthy]] hosted an evening interview show with newsmakers and people of interest called ''JP'', as well as a similar program in the early 1990s entitled ''In Person with J.P. McCarthy''. He also previously hosted sports interview show specials through the 1970s.<ref name=\"toledo\"/> In 1995, former WXYZ-TV news anchor [[Bill Bonds]] hosted the 11 p.m. talk/interview show, ''Bonds Tonight''. Bonds eventually would end up anchoring and reporting on WJBK's newscasts.<ref name=\"soupy\"/>\n\n===Past program preemptions and deferrals===\nEven though WJBK was one of CBS' stronger affiliates, it would preempt or reschedule some network programs. As the flagship station of [[Detroit Tigers]] baseball from the 1950s to the 1970s, it would preempt network programming to televise games. From 1970 until the early 1980s, the station would air its own local [[breakfast television|morning newscast]] from 7 to 8 a.m. and then ''Good Morning, Detroit'' instead of the ''[[CBS This Morning|CBS Morning News]]''. In 1992, it chose again not to air ''CBS This Morning'' in favor of its own local newscast.<ref>Carter, Bill. \"The Media Business; CBS's Ruptured Ties To Affiliates ''The New York Times'' September 14, 1992</ref> The station would regularly reschedule CBS' daytime [[game show]]s and it would also move the [[soap opera]] ''[[Guiding Light]]'' from its usual network airtime of 3 p.m. ET to 10 a.m., with episodes airing on a [[broadcast delay|one-day delay]].<ref name=\"dettv\"/> WJBK would also preempt the [[The CBS Late Movie|CBS late night schedule]] with syndicated [[rerun]]s including ''[[Cheers]]'' and late night [[feature film|movies]] until the debut of the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' in 1993, when the station cleared the show at 11:35&nbsp;p.m.\n\nAfter the affiliation switch, WJBK maintained its existing schedule, with the exception of the expansion of its news programming including the move and conversion of its 11 p.m. newscast to an hour-long broadcast at 10 p.m. As Fox offered less network programming, especially during the daytime hours, WJBK would fill its schedule with more syndicated programs and off-network reruns. However, the station, like its fellow former New World stations, never ran the [[Fox Kids]] children's programming block. That block would remain on former Fox affiliate WKBD before eventually moving to [[WADL (TV)|WADL]] (channel 38) and then WDWB-TV (channel 20, now [[WMYD]]). In 2014, WJBK cleared [[Steve Rotfeld Productions]]' [[Xploration Station]] block, making it the first time the station has ever cleared Fox children's programming.\n\n==Sports programming==\n\n===Detroit Tigers===\nFrom the 1950s to the 1970s, WJBK was a pioneer in Detroit sports broadcasting. In 1949, it was the first television station in Michigan to broadcast live Detroit Tigers baseball and Detroit Lions football games.<ref name=\"foxsite\"/> From 1953 to 1974, WJBK served as the first flagship station of the [[List of Detroit Tigers broadcasters|Tigers Television Network]] with games broadcast on stations throughout Michigan, northern Indiana, and northwest Ohio.<ref name=\"tigers\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.mlb.com/tigers/team/broadcasters|title=Tigers Broadcasters|website=MLB.com}}</ref> In the 1960s, longtime Tigers broadcaster and former player [[George Kell]] hosted the pregame show ''Tigers Warm Up'' on the field during batting practice.<ref name=\"dac\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.vintagedetroit.com/blog/2010/03/05/remembering-george-kell%e2%80%99s-tiger-pre-game-show/|title=Remembering George Kell\u2019s Tiger Pre-Game Show|first=Bill|last=Dow|date=March 5, 2010}}</ref> During the [[2007 Detroit Tigers season|2007 season]], the station aired some regular season Tigers games produced by [[Fox Sports Detroit]]. Currently, the only Tigers games aired on WJBK are the Tigers' season home opener and national coverage presented by [[Fox Major League Baseball|Fox]]; WJBK also aired select Tigers games featured on CBS' MLB coverage from 1990 to 1993.\n\n===Detroit Pistons===\nWJBK also televised [[Detroit Pistons]] games from the time that the team's relocated to Detroit from [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]], [[Indiana]] in 1957, until 1972; the team's games began airing on WKBD-TV the following season. The Pistons would also air on WJBK during nationally televised games on [[NBA on CBS|CBS]] from 1973 to 1990; WJBK televised both of the first two Pistons NBA Finals championships of 1989 and 1990 (game 5 of the latter series was the last NBA game aired on CBS).\n\n===Detroit Red Wings===\n[[Detroit Red Wings]] [[National Hockey League|NHL]] games, produced again by Fox Sports Detroit, would also be aired on the station from [[2003\u201304 Detroit Red Wings season|2003]] to [[2006\u201307 Detroit Red Wings season|2007]]. In March 2007, WJBK began broadcasting Red Wings games in high definition. Previously the Red Wings aired on the station various times between 1956 and 1980 through broadcast rights held by [[NHL on CBS|CBS]] and again from 1995 to 1999 through [[NHL on Fox|Fox's contract with the NHL]]; this included the team's [[Stanley Cup Final]]s victories in [[1997 Stanley Cup Finals|1997]] and [[1998 Stanley Cup Finals|1998]].\n\n===Detroit Lions===\nWJBK has had a long-standing relationship with the NFL's Detroit Lions (first with CBS, now Fox), having carried most of its games since 1956, when CBS started airing NFL games. Except for the first three months of the [[1994 Detroit Lions season|1994 season]] (before the affiliation switch took effect), it has been the unofficial regular-season \"home\" station of the Lions ever since. For the first 15 weeks of the 1994 season, the games aired on lame-duck Fox outlet WKBD. However, regular season home games were subject to the [[National Football League television blackout policies|NFL's local television blackout policy]]. This occurred five times during the [[2008 Detroit Lions season|Lions' winless season of 2008]] when five home games were blacked out due to low ticket sales. However, in 2015, the NFL decided to lift the blackout rules on an experimental basis, meaning that Lions games were shown on Channel 2 regardless of ticket sales; this policy was continued the next season in [[2016 Detroit Lions season|2016]] as well, and has continued indefinitely as of [[2019 Detroit Lions season|2019]].\n\nIn previous years, WJBK had also televised Lions preseason games as the flagship station of the [[Detroit Lions Television Network]] and produced pregame and postgame shows. Those preseason broadcast rights were then held by WWJ-TV and then WXYZ-TV until 2015, when WJBK once again became the official preseason station of the Lions as well.\n\nWJBK's sportscasters have also been team play-by-play announcers through the years with [[Van Patrick]] doing Tigers, Lions and [[Notre Dame Football]] games. [[Ray Lane (sportscaster)|Ray Lane]] would be paired with [[National Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] announcer [[Ernie Harwell]] on Tigers' radio broadcasts from 1967 to 1972; and current [[sports director]] [[Dan Miller (sportscaster)|Dan Miller]] performs radio play by play for the Lions.\n\n==News operation==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:WJBK open.png|thumb|right|275px|WJBK 6:00 PM newscast title card, used since early November 2012.{{deletable image-caption|Monday, December 19, 2016}}]] -->\nWJBK currently broadcasts 68\u00bd hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 11\u00bd hours each weekday and 5\u00bd hours each on Saturdays and Sundays); in regards to the number of hours devoted to news programming, it is the highest local newscast output among all broadcast television stations in the state of Michigan. In addition, WJBK produces a sports highlight program on Sunday nights following the 10 p.m. newscast called ''Sports Works'' (which is also the branding of the sports segments seen within its newscasts); the show is hosted by either WJBK sports director Dan Miller or sports anchor/reporter Woody Woodriffe, and typically features a roundtable discussion with members of the Detroit sports media including [[Sean Baligian]], formerly of [[WDFN]] (1130 AM); [[Bob Wojnowski]] from the ''[[Detroit News]]''; [[Pat Caputo]] from the ''[[Oakland Press]]'' and [[WXYT-FM]] (97.1) and [[Tony Ortiz]] from WXYT-FM.\n\nWJBK operates a fleet of [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] [[Ford E series|E350]] [[electronic news-gathering|ENG]] vehicles with [[microwave transmission]] and [[video editing]] capabilities. The station also has ([[satellite news gathering|SNG]]) mobile [[satellite]] uplink capability. For aerial news coverage, WJBK shares a [[Eurocopter]] AS350BA A-star news [[helicopter]] with WXYZ-TV and WDIV-TV as part of a [[Local News Service]] agreement. The aircraft has [[High-definition television|HD]] video capability and goes by the [[aviation call signs|call sign]] \"Red Bird\" (although WJBK brands the helicopter as \"SkyFox\"). In 2009, WJBK and WXYZ-TV expanded the LNS agreement to allow the sharing of local news video.\n\nIn an effort to cut expenses, WJBK and WXYZ's respective owners, Fox and the E. W. Scripps Company, established an LNS in all markets where both companies own stations. The stations pool newsgathering resources and share video during coverage of general news events.<ref name=\"LNS\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/fox-gannett-and-scripps-share-tampa-34870|title=Fox, Gannett and Scripps Share in Tampa|first=Michael|last=Malone|website=Broadcasting & Cable}}</ref> While the news department primarily focuses its local news coverage on [[southeastern Michigan]], it also provides coverage of larger stories in southwestern Ontario, northern Ohio and the rest of Michigan.\n\n===''TV-2 Eyewitness News''===\nThrough much of the 1960s and 1970s WJBK's ''TV-2 [[Eyewitness News]]'' dominated the newscast ratings in the Detroit market.<ref name=\"newsk\">Kiska, Tim. A Newscast for the Masses: The History of Detroit Television News. 2009. Wayne State University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-8143-3302-0}}</ref> This began with [[news presenter|news anchor]] Jac LeGoff and grew when LeGoff was paired with newscaster John Kelly. Other popular longtime Detroit television personalities including Joe Weaver, [[Jerry Hodak]], Van Patrick and Marilyn Turner would also be a part of WJBK's ratings success. The station's ratings would begin to wane in the mid-1970s after then-ABC O&O WXYZ-TV hired away WJBK's and [[WDIV|WWJ-TV]]'s top talent, including Kelly and Turner and eventually LeGoff and Hodak.<ref name=\"newsk\"/> WJBK's newscasts remained competitive in the 1970s with a new stable of talent including anchors Joe Glover, Robbie Timmons, Harry Gallagher, Murray Feldman and [[Terry Murphy (broadcaster)|Terry Murphy]]. The station also had correspondents in bureaus at the Detroit [[Coleman A. Young Municipal Center|City-County Building]] (Louis Miller), the Michigan state capital in Lansing and Washington, D.C.<ref name=\"toledo\"/> Nationally syndicated radio host [[George Noory]] was even a news producer at WJBK from 1974 to 1978, before becoming a [[news director]] at stations in [[Minneapolis]] and [[St. Louis]].<ref name=\"clear\">{{Cite web|url=http://clearchanneloutdoor.com/|title=Clear Channel Outdoor - Innovative Out of Home Advertising Solutions|website=clearchanneloutdoor.com}}</ref> However, by 1980, the station's news ratings steeply declined with the growing dominance of WXYZ. Also by this time WDIV's new owners, [[Post-Newsweek Stations]], were making aggressive changes to bolster its station's image and ratings from third place. By 1982, management at WJBK replaced most of the staff, which sank the station's news ratings further into third place, from where it would almost never recover.<ref name=\"newsk\"/>\n\nWith new management, WJBK's news department saw a resurgence by 1990 with new staff that included Sherry Margolis, Huel Perkins and the rehiring of former anchor Joe Glover. The station would also hire away news staff and talent away from top rated WXYZ including Rich Fisher, Dayna Eubanks, Catherine Lehan, Jerry Hodak and investigative reporter Vince Wade.<ref name=\"soupy\"/> The station revised its image with a new logo, graphics, music and news set and began airing Detroit's first 4 p.m. newscast as part of a three-hour evening news block with half-hour newscasts at 4, 5 and 6 p.m. At the same time, the station also became Detroit's first television station to launch a weekend morning newscast. Overall, WJBK's news ratings would not improve enough to surpass WXYZ and WDIV, which would continue to go head-to-head for first place. The station would also begin to simulcast its late newscast on WADL, which lasted until 1998. It would also be among the first television stations in the country to air obituaries in 1995 during the Detroit newspaper strike.\n\n===''Fox 2 News''===\n[[File:WJBK News Remote Van Novi Michigan.JPG|250px|thumb|right|Fox 2 News Remote Van.]]\nWhen WJBK switched affiliations from CBS to Fox in December 1994, the station adopted a news-intensive format.  It has retained a news schedule similar to the one it had as a CBS affiliate.  The 35-minute 11 p.m. newscast was moved to 10 p.m. and expanded to an hour, and the weekday morning newscast was also expanded. The weekend 6 p.m. newscasts would also be expanded to one hour. WJBK now had a late local newscast in first place as it immediately overtook the hour-long 10 p.m. newscast that WKBD had at the time in the ratings. Eventually, WJBK would drop the 4 p.m. newscast, but the station's profile and ratings for its morning and 10 p.m. newscasts would surge with it out of direct competition from its main competitors WDIV and WXYZ.<ref name=\"newsk\"/> In 1995, the station would hire news anchor Bill Bonds after his departure from WXYZ-TV. Bonds would fill the 11 p.m. timeslot with a news/interview show, ''Bonds Tonight''.<ref name=\"soupy\"/>\n\nThe newscasts were branded as ''Fox 2 Eyewitness News'' until 1997, when Fox took full ownership of the station and rebranded its newscasts as ''Fox 2 News''. By that time, the station would also release its previous WXYZ hires. At the same time, Fox's news management brought on new talent including Dan Miller, Alan Lee and [[Monica Gayle (news anchor)|Monica Gayle]] from Seattle. By 1998, the station would bolster its image by improving its investigative and consumer advocate unit and branding it as ''The Problem Solvers''. It also adopted a slogan complimentary to Detroit's working class heritage, \"''News That Works for You''\". On September 24, 2007, WJBK relaunched an 11 p.m. newscast, using the ''NewsEdge'' format originally used by Fox [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] station [[WTVT]]. It also changed its logo, graphics and news theme to an image that became standard on the Fox O&O stations. In April 2008, the station became the first Fox-owned station (and the third television station in Detroit) to broadcast its news programming in high definition.\n\nOn September 12, 2016, WJBK added an extra half hour to its 6 p.m. newscast.<ref>[https://www.google.com/amp/s/changingnewscasts.wordpress.com/2016/09/02/small-minor-newscast-change-95/amp/?client=safari A small minor newscast change\u2026 #95]</ref>\n\n===Mornings===\nWJBK had a tradition of producing its own morning news shows instead of airing CBS' morning news programs, beginning with a 7:30&nbsp;a.m. newscast in 1969. The newscast would soon expand to an hour starting at 7 a.m. It became a mix of news, interviews and features and would be renamed ''Good Morning, Detroit'' and eventually moved to 8 a.m.<ref name=\"toledo\"/> During its run, Vic Caputo would co-anchor separately with Beverly Payne, Ken Ford and Kathy O'Brien. Payne would be the first African-American female news anchor in Detroit.<ref name=\"soupy\"/> ''Good Morning, Detroit'' eventually became ''Morning Magazine'', hosted by Kathy O'Brien and Gary Cubberly. In 1982, ''Morning Magazine'' was discontinued and briefly became ''Two's Company'', also hosted by O'Brien and Cubberly. In 1992, the station preempted CBS' morning news program again when WJBK rehired Jerry Hodak from WXYZ to co-anchor ''Eyewitness News Morning''. Just prior to that, WJBK also debuted Detroit's first weekend morning newscast, which was first anchored by former ''PM Magazine'' host Gary Cubberly. Competitor WDIV would follow with its own weekend morning newscast, as did eventually WXYZ. Since then, the station has broadcast more morning news hours than any other Detroit television station. In September 2009, the morning newscast was expanded to 5\u00bd hours, airing from 4:30 to 10 a.m. In September 2011, ''Fox 2 News Morning'' expanded to 6\u00bd hours from 4:30 to 11 a.m., where it joins the station's hour-long midday newscast at 11 a.m. WJBK has also had the longest-running midday newscast in the Detroit market, which originated in 1966 in the noon timeslot, before moving to 11 a.m. shortly after the switch to Fox.<ref name=\"hodak\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/JERRY+HODAK+JOINS+WJBK-TV+2-a012559293|title=Jerry Hodak joins WJBK-TV 2, WJBK, PRNewswire}}</ref>\n\nOn May 6, 2015, WJBK's morning show became the subject of notoriety for a [[blooper]], wherein an anchor innuendously declared a hope for a \"[[dry hump]] day\".<ref name=metro-dryhumpday>{{cite web|title=A Fox News anchor said \u2018dry hump\u2019 live on TV and her co-host had the best reaction|url=http://metro.co.uk/2015/05/07/a-fox-news-anchor-said-dry-hump-live-on-tv-and-her-co-host-had-the-best-reaction-5185823/|website=Metro (UK)|accessdate=May 8, 2015}}</ref><ref name=nydn-dryhumpday>{{cite web|title=SEE IT: Detroit TV anchor stuns co-workers, weatherman by hoping for \u2018dry hump day\u2019|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/detroit-tv-anchor-hopes-dry-hump-day-article-1.2215020|website=New York Daily News|accessdate=May 8, 2015}}</ref> In the fall of 2018, WJBK begin expanding its current morning newscasts to 8 hours with addition of half-hour starting at 4 a.m.\n\n===Ratings===\nAs of February 2012, WJBK's ''Fox 2 News Morning'' has consistently remained the Detroit market's highest rated local morning newscast (6\u20137 a.m., 4.5 rating/17 share). After years of faltering at a distant third against WDIV and WXYZ, WJBK began to make gains in its audience growth in other newscasts. While WDIV continued to have the most-watched evening and late newscasts, WJBK's 10 p.m. news (7.5 rating/12 share) remains the highest-rated prime time newscast in [[Metro Detroit]]. Its early evening 5 and 5:30&nbsp;p.m. newscasts (6.0/13) have surpassed WXYZ-TV's longtime dominant 5 p.m. newscast (5.8/13) for second place. While WJBK's 6 p.m. newscast (5.1/10) has become a very close third moving within one rating point to WXYZ's newscast in that timeslot (6.1/12). Since debuting in 2007, WJBK's 11 p.m. newscast ''Newsedge'' has been in third place overall (5.0 rating/9 share).<ref name=\"wdiv\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/wdiv-tv-local-4-is-detroits-1-station-in-february-ratings-141110413.html|title=WDIV-TV Local 4 Is Detroit's #1 Station in February Ratings|website=www.prnewswire.com}}</ref>\n\n===Notable current on-air staff===\n* [[M.

In January 2007, WFQX began simulcasting WJBK's morning newscast from 6 to 8 a.m. under the title ''Michigan's Fox News Morning''. The simulcasts were made possible with an agreement that offered northern Michigan businesses advertising opportunities during the newscast. WFQX would also air the second half of WJBK's 10 p.m. newscast following its own half-hour 10 p.m. newscast. WFQX would drop WJBK's newscasts altogether in October 2007, after the station was sold and CBS affiliate [[WWTV]] began producing WFQX's 10 p.m. and morning newscasts.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Michigan|Television|United States}}\n*[[Media in Detroit]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website|https://www.fox2detroit.com/}}\n*{{URL|http://www.michiguide.com/dials/tv/wjbk.html|Michiguide.com's listing for WJBK}}\n*{{TVQ|WJBK}}\n*{{TV Fool|WJBK}}\n*{{BIA|WJBK|TV|TV}}\n\n{{Detroit TV}}\n{{Fox Michigan}}\n{{Fox (company)}}\n{{Major U.S. TV O-O Stations}}\n{{Detroit Lions}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wjbk}}\n[[Category:Television stations in Detroit|JBK]]\n[[Category:Fox network affiliates]]\n[[Category:Movies!

It was the third television station to sign-on in Detroit after WWJ-TV (channel 4, now [[WDIV-TV]]) and [[WXYZ-TV]] (channel 7) - all of which have signed on in a 14-month timeframe. Despite Detroit being a major television market, it only accommodated three VHF allocations due to being shortspaced between [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]] ([[WJRT-TV|channel 12]]) and [[Saginaw, Michigan|Saginaw]] ([[WNEM-TV|channel 5]]) to the north, [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]] (channels [[WLNS-TV|6]] and [[WILX-TV|10]]) to the west, [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]] (channels [[WTOL|11]] and [[WTVG|13]]) to the south, and [[Cleveland]] (channels [[WKYC|3]], [[WEWS-TV|5]] and [[WJW (TV)|8]]), Windsor, Ontario ([[CBET-DT|channel 9]]), and [[London, Ontario]] ([[CFPL-DT|channel 10]]) to the east. For this reason, WJBK was assigned the final VHF channel in Detroit.\n\nAt sign on, the first program broadcast by WJBK was a presentation of ''Lucky Pup'' at 6:15&nbsp;p.m. that evening.<ref name=\"dettv\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/vintagedetroittvandmovieboard/?sid=60bd02e21d21fd4a42d4733064c8e95c|title=Keith Milford's Vintage Detroit TV and Movie Board|website=Keith Milford's Vintage Detroit TV and Movie Board}}</ref> The station was originally an [[network affiliate|affiliate]] of both [[CBS]] and the [[DuMont Television Network]]. It was originally owned by Fort Industry Broadcasting, owned by George B. Storer and then based in nearby Toledo, Ohio. Fort Industry, which would later be renamed [[Storer Communications|Storer Broadcasting]], also owned WJBK radio (1500 AM, now [[WLQV]], and 93.1 FM, now [[WDRQ]]). The station originally operated from Detroit's [[Detroit Masonic Temple|Masonic Temple]] until 1956, when its operations were moved to a [[WJBK-TV Studios Building|purpose-built studio facility]] on Second Avenue in [[New Center, Detroit|Detroit's New Center]] section. WJBK-TV would eventually become an exclusive CBS affiliate by 1955, when Windsor, Ontario-based CKLW-TV (channel 9, now [[CBC Television|CBC]] O&O CBET-DT) became a DuMont affiliate. WJBK first broadcast in color around 1956. In 1970, the station moved to its current broadcast facilities on West Nine Mile Road in Southfield.<ref name=\"foxsite\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.myfoxdetroit.com/dpp/about_us/station_history/wjbk-fox-2-station-history |title=History of Fox2, myfoxdetroit.com |access-date=March 20, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128084230/http://www.myfoxdetroit.com/dpp/about_us/station_history/wjbk-fox-2-station-history |archive-date=January 28, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Like most studio facilities built by Storer during that time, it resembles a Southern [[antebellum architecture|antebellum]] mansion.\n\n[[File:Wjbktv2.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|200px|The WJBK circle 2 logo, used from 1978 to 1983.]]\n\nThe station went through a number of ownership and management changes with its parent companies in the 1980s and 1990s. In 1985, the [[private equity firm|equity firm]] [[Kohlberg Kravis Roberts]] (KKR) acquired Storer Communications, Incorporated in a [[leveraged buyout]]. Storer spurned offers from Knight-Ridder Newspapers, Tele-Communications, Inc and Scripps Howard Broadcasting Co., though Scripps Howard would successfully acquire cross-town rival ABC owned and operated station WXYZ-TV in 1986 after the ABC-Capital Cities Communications merger was approved by federal regulators. KKR then sold all of the Storer broadcast assets, including WJBK, to [[George N. Gillett, Jr.|Gillett Communications]] in 1987, after an attempt to sell the stations to [[Lorimar-Telepictures]] in 1986 failed. When Gillett went [[Bankruptcy in the United States|bankrupt]] in 1992, it reorganized the ownership of its television stations into SCI Television. The following year, in 1993, a few other station owners\u2014Federal Broadcasting, owners of [[WWJ (AM)]]/[[WXYT-FM|FM]]; [[Westinghouse Broadcasting|Group W]]; and CBS\u2014showed interest in the station. Scripps considered trading WXYZ back to ABC in order to bid for the Gillett stations as a group. But in 1993, SCI was acquired by the film and television production company [[New World Pictures#New World Communications|New World Communications]].\n\n===As a Fox station===\n{{further|1994\u20131996 United States broadcast television realignment}}\nIn May 1994, [[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]], then-parent of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network, purchased a 20% ownership stake (amounting to a $500 million investment) in WJBK's owner New World Communications.

Despite a three-month interruption in coverage due to CBS losing the NFC rights (the games instead aired on [[WKBD-TV]], channel 50, for the first three months of Fox's NFC telecasts), with the switch, the [[Detroit Lions]]' regular season games would continue to air on WJBK.\n\nCBS found it difficult to find a new home in Detroit. WXYZ and Cleveland sister station WEWS-TV were both heavily wooed to become CBS affiliates, but the E. W. Scripps Company signed an affiliation deal with ABC in June 1994 that renewed the network's affiliations with both stations and resulted in [[WMAR-TV|three]] [[WFTS-TV|other]] [[KNXV|stations]] switching to that network. WDIV was later eliminated due to that station's long-term affiliation contract with NBC. As a result, CBS was forced to deal with the market's lower-rated [[ultra high frequency|UHF]] outlets, none of which had the kind of signal penetration that WJBK had. As a contingency plan, CBS signed a long-term affiliation deal with [[WTOL]] in Toledo, Ohio; which provides city-grade coverage to most of Detroit's southern suburbs and grade B coverage of Detroit itself. It also persuaded Mid-Michigan's longtime NBC affiliate, WNEM-TV, to switch to CBS; WNEM provided stronger coverage of Detroit's outer northern suburbs than did the market's longtime CBS affiliate, [[WEYI-TV]]. It also convinced WLNS-TV in Lansing to build a translator in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]]. The main WLNS signal provided at least grade B coverage to many of Detroit's western suburbs.\n\nWith just days to go before WJBK was due to switch to Fox, CBS faced the prospect of having to import WTOL, WNEM, and WLNS on area cable providers until it could find a replacement affiliate. CBS would end up purchasing low-rated UHF [[Independent station (North America)|independent station]] WGPR-TV (channel 62, now [[WWJ-TV]]) in September 1994. The last CBS network program to air on WJBK was a first-run episode of ''[[Walker, Texas Ranger]]'' at 10:00&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]] on December 10, 1994; channel 2 officially became a Fox affiliate the next day, when the network's programming lineup moved to the station from WKBD; the first Fox network program to air on the station as a full-time affiliate was ''[[Fox NFL Sunday]]'' at noon that day, which led into that afternoon's NFL doubleheader: an early game between the [[1994 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] and the [[1994 Los Angeles Rams season|Los Angeles Rams]] and a mid-afternoon game between the [[1994 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] and the [[1994 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego Chargers]]. Former Fox affiliate WKBD briefly became an independent station before becoming a charter affiliate of [[UPN]] in January 1995.\n\nUntil channel 62 built a new transmitter in 1999, WTOL served as the default CBS affiliate for most of the southern portion of the market, while WNEM served the northern portion and WLNS served the western portion.\n\nAs a result of the network switch, WJBK changed its branding from \"TV 2\" to \"Fox 2\" by the fall of 1995<ref name=\"michg\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.michiguide.com/dials/tv/wjbk.html?fb_xd_fragment#?=&cb=f1aa664e264b8b8&relation=parent&transport=fragment&frame=f3524f805d65c8c&error=unknown_user|title=WJBK TV Channel 2 Detroit - Michiguide.com Dials (TV)|website=www.michiguide.com}}</ref> (becoming one of the few New World stations that switched to the network to adhere to the network's branding conventions before Fox's buyout of New World).

[[Broadcast syndication|Syndicated]] programs currently seen on WJBK include ''[[Judge Judy]]'', ''[[Dish Nation]]'', ''[[The Wendy Williams Show]]'', ''[[TMZ on TV]]'', and ''[[Extra (American TV program)|Extra]]'', among others.\n\n===Local productions===\nSome of WJBK's early productions included popular children's shows. ''Milky's Movie Party'' starring Milky the [[Clown]], played by magician Clarence R. Cummings, Jr., was one of the station's first locally produced children's programs from 1950 to 1955. The program featured a mix of [[animated cartoon|cartoons]] and [[Western (genre)|westerns]] with Cummings performing magic tricks with other acts in front of a live audience. Cummings would eventually take the Milky character to WXYZ-TV and the former WWJ-TV (now WDIV).<ref name=\"soupy\">Kiska, Tim. From Soupy to Nuts: A History of Detroit Television. 2005.

Hunt with his sidekick [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]] Bongo Bailey hosted cartoons and taught viewers about various wildlife.

The hour-long show included games, contests, and interviews with the biggest stars of the time including [[Lucille Ball]] and [[Red Skelton]]. Bergeson also hosted other WJBK shows in the 1950s including ''Your TV Golf Pro'' and ''The Name Game''.<ref name=\"soupy\"/> From 1967 to 1983, [[Sir Graves Ghastly]], played by actor [[Lawson J. Deming]], hosted WJBK's assorted sci-fi and [[horror film|horror movies]] on Saturday afternoons; the humorous character became a popular figure in Detroit television. Deming had originally come to the station as a [[puppet]]eer and voice actor for the children's program ''[[Woodrow the Woodsman]]'' when that show moved from Cleveland's WKYC-TV to WJBK in 1966. In addition to playing the character in Cleveland, he also played Sir Graves on [[WUSA (TV)|WTOP-TV]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] at the same time.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.sirgravesghastly.com/ |title=Sir Graves Ghastly Official Site |access-date=September 6, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160215113436/http://www.sirgravesghastly.com/ |archive-date=February 15, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n''With This Ring'' was a nationally syndicated [[religious broadcasting|religious]] program produced at the studios of WJBK from the early 1970s through the mid-1990s. The weekly 15-minute show hosted by [[Roman Catholic]] priest Raymond Schlinkert featured lectures and advice about marriage and family life. The program was syndicated to several other U.S. commercial stations, usually shown immediately following the station's sign-on or before sign-off on Sundays.\n\nWJBK would also produce Sunday [[public affairs (broadcasting)|public affairs]]/interview shows over the years including ''Focus Detroit'', hosted by reporters Woody Willis and Beverly Payne in 1973;<ref name=\"toledo\">{{Cite web|url=https://vintagetoledotv.com/|title=vintage toledo tv|website=Vinatge Toledo TV}}</ref> ''Sunday in Detroit'', hosted by news anchor Kathy O'Brien, would air around 1980 and WJBK business reporter and news anchor Murray Feldman also hosted a Sunday business and financial program in the mid-1990s called ''Moneywise''. WJBK produced a local version of the syndicated program ''[[PM Magazine]]'' from 1978 to the mid-1980s. The show changed titles over the years eventually becoming known as ''PM Detroit'' \u2013 it also had various hosts included Ronnie Klemmer, Lorrie Kapp, Gary Cubberly and Mattie Majors.<ref name=\"toledo\"/> The station was also the Detroit home and active participant for comedian [[Jerry Lewis]]' annual ''[[Muscular Dystrophy Association|MDA]] [[MDA Labor Day Telethon|Labor Day Telethon]]'' for several years.\n\nFrom 1983 to 1986, popular [[WJR]] (760 AM) morning radio host [[J. P. McCarthy]] hosted an evening interview show with newsmakers and people of interest called ''JP'', as well as a similar program in the early 1990s entitled ''In Person with J.P. McCarthy''. He also previously hosted sports interview show specials through the 1970s.<ref name=\"toledo\"/> In 1995, former WXYZ-TV news anchor [[Bill Bonds]] hosted the 11 p.m. talk/interview show, ''Bonds Tonight''. Bonds eventually would end up anchoring and reporting on WJBK's newscasts.<ref name=\"soupy\"/>\n\n===Past program preemptions and deferrals===\nEven though WJBK was one of CBS' stronger affiliates, it would preempt or reschedule some network programs. As the flagship station of [[Detroit Tigers]] baseball from the 1950s to the 1970s, it would preempt network programming to televise games. From 1970 until the early 1980s, the station would air its own local [[breakfast television|morning newscast]] from 7 to 8 a.m. and then ''Good Morning, Detroit'' instead of the ''[[CBS This Morning|CBS Morning News]]''. In 1992, it chose again not to air ''CBS This Morning'' in favor of its own local newscast.<ref>Carter, Bill. \"The Media Business; CBS's Ruptured Ties To Affiliates ''The New York Times'' September 14, 1992</ref> The station would regularly reschedule CBS' daytime [[game show]]s and it would also move the [[soap opera]] ''[[Guiding Light]]'' from its usual network airtime of 3 p.m. ET to 10 a.m., with episodes airing on a [[broadcast delay|one-day delay]].<ref name=\"dettv\"/> WJBK would also preempt the [[The CBS Late Movie|CBS late night schedule]] with syndicated [[rerun]]s including ''[[Cheers]]'' and late night [[feature film|movies]] until the debut of the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' in 1993, when the station cleared the show at 11:35&nbsp;p.m.\n\nAfter the affiliation switch, WJBK maintained its existing schedule, with the exception of the expansion of its news programming including the move and conversion of its 11 p.m. newscast to an hour-long broadcast at 10 p.m. As Fox offered less network programming, especially during the daytime hours, WJBK would fill its schedule with more syndicated programs and off-network reruns. However, the station, like its fellow former New World stations, never ran the [[Fox Kids]] children's programming block. That block would remain on former Fox affiliate WKBD before eventually moving to [[WADL (TV)|WADL]] (channel 38) and then WDWB-TV (channel 20, now [[WMYD]]). In 2014, WJBK cleared [[Steve Rotfeld Productions]]' [[Xploration Station]] block, making it the first time the station has ever cleared Fox children's programming.\n\n==Sports programming==\n\n===Detroit Tigers===\nFrom the 1950s to the 1970s, WJBK was a pioneer in Detroit sports broadcasting. In 1949, it was the first television station in Michigan to broadcast live Detroit Tigers baseball and Detroit Lions football games.<ref name=\"foxsite\"/> From 1953 to 1974, WJBK served as the first flagship station of the [[List of Detroit Tigers broadcasters|Tigers Television Network]] with games broadcast on stations throughout Michigan, northern Indiana, and northwest Ohio.<ref name=\"tigers\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.mlb.com/tigers/team/broadcasters|title=Tigers Broadcasters|website=MLB.com}}</ref> In the 1960s, longtime Tigers broadcaster and former player [[George Kell]] hosted the pregame show ''Tigers Warm Up'' on the field during batting practice.<ref name=\"dac\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.vintagedetroit.com/blog/2010/03/05/remembering-george-kell%e2%80%99s-tiger-pre-game-show/|title=Remembering George Kell\u2019s Tiger Pre-Game Show|first=Bill|last=Dow|date=March 5, 2010}}</ref> During the [[2007 Detroit Tigers season|2007 season]], the station aired some regular season Tigers games produced by [[Fox Sports Detroit]]. Currently, the only Tigers games aired on WJBK are the Tigers' season home opener and national coverage presented by [[Fox Major League Baseball|Fox]]; WJBK also aired select Tigers games featured on CBS' MLB coverage from 1990 to 1993.\n\n===Detroit Pistons===\nWJBK also televised [[Detroit Pistons]] games from the time that the team's relocated to Detroit from [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]], [[Indiana]] in 1957, until 1972; the team's games began airing on WKBD-TV the following season. The Pistons would also air on WJBK during nationally televised games on [[NBA on CBS|CBS]] from 1973 to 1990; WJBK televised both of the first two Pistons NBA Finals championships of 1989 and 1990 (game 5 of the latter series was the last NBA game aired on CBS).\n\n===Detroit Red Wings===\n[[Detroit Red Wings]] [[National Hockey League|NHL]] games, produced again by Fox Sports Detroit, would also be aired on the station from [[2003\u201304 Detroit Red Wings season|2003]] to [[2006\u201307 Detroit Red Wings season|2007]]. In March 2007, WJBK began broadcasting Red Wings games in high definition. Previously the Red Wings aired on the station various times between 1956 and 1980 through broadcast rights held by [[NHL on CBS|CBS]] and again from 1995 to 1999 through [[NHL on Fox|Fox's contract with the NHL]]; this included the team's [[Stanley Cup Final]]s victories in [[1997 Stanley Cup Finals|1997]] and [[1998 Stanley Cup Finals|1998]].\n\n===Detroit Lions===\nWJBK has had a long-standing relationship with the NFL's Detroit Lions (first with CBS, now Fox), having carried most of its games since 1956, when CBS started airing NFL games. Except for the first three months of the [[1994 Detroit Lions season|1994 season]] (before the affiliation switch took effect), it has been the unofficial regular-season \"home\" station of the Lions ever since. For the first 15 weeks of the 1994 season, the games aired on lame-duck Fox outlet WKBD. However, regular season home games were subject to the [[National Football League television blackout policies|NFL's local television blackout policy]]. This occurred five times during the [[2008 Detroit Lions season|Lions' winless season of 2008]] when five home games were blacked out due to low ticket sales. However, in 2015, the NFL decided to lift the blackout rules on an experimental basis, meaning that Lions games were shown on Channel 2 regardless of ticket sales; this policy was continued the next season in [[2016 Detroit Lions season|2016]] as well, and has continued indefinitely as of [[2019 Detroit Lions season|2019]].\n\nIn previous years, WJBK had also televised Lions preseason games as the flagship station of the [[Detroit Lions Television Network]] and produced pregame and postgame shows. Those preseason broadcast rights were then held by WWJ-TV and then WXYZ-TV until 2015, when WJBK once again became the official preseason station of the Lions as well.\n\nWJBK's sportscasters have also been team play-by-play announcers through the years with [[Van Patrick]] doing Tigers, Lions and [[Notre Dame Football]] games. [[Ray Lane (sportscaster)|Ray Lane]] would be paired with [[National Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] announcer [[Ernie Harwell]] on Tigers' radio broadcasts from 1967 to 1972; and current [[sports director]] [[Dan Miller (sportscaster)|Dan Miller]] performs radio play by play for the Lions.\n\n==News operation==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:WJBK open.png|thumb|right|275px|WJBK 6:00 PM newscast title card, used since early November 2012.{{deletable image-caption|Monday, December 19, 2016}}]] -->\nWJBK currently broadcasts 68\u00bd hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 11\u00bd hours each weekday and 5\u00bd hours each on Saturdays and Sundays); in regards to the number of hours devoted to news programming, it is the highest local newscast output among all broadcast television stations in the state of Michigan. In addition, WJBK produces a sports highlight program on Sunday nights following the 10 p.m. newscast called ''Sports Works'' (which is also the branding of the sports segments seen within its newscasts); the show is hosted by either WJBK sports director Dan Miller or sports anchor/reporter Woody Woodriffe, and typically features a roundtable discussion with members of the Detroit sports media including [[Sean Baligian]], formerly of [[WDFN]] (1130 AM); [[Bob Wojnowski]] from the ''[[Detroit News]]''; [[Pat Caputo]] from the ''[[Oakland Press]]'' and [[WXYT-FM]] (97.1) and [[Tony Ortiz]] from WXYT-FM.\n\nWJBK operates a fleet of [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] [[Ford E series|E350]] [[electronic news-gathering|ENG]] vehicles with [[microwave transmission]] and [[video editing]] capabilities. The station also has ([[satellite news gathering|SNG]]) mobile [[satellite]] uplink capability. For aerial news coverage, WJBK shares a [[Eurocopter]] AS350BA A-star news [[helicopter]] with WXYZ-TV and WDIV-TV as part of a [[Local News Service]] agreement. The aircraft has [[High-definition television|HD]] video capability and goes by the [[aviation call signs|call sign]] \"Red Bird\" (although WJBK brands the helicopter as \"SkyFox\"). In 2009, WJBK and WXYZ-TV expanded the LNS agreement to allow the sharing of local news video.\n\nIn an effort to cut expenses, WJBK and WXYZ's respective owners, Fox and the E. W. Scripps Company, established an LNS in all markets where both companies own stations. The stations pool newsgathering resources and share video during coverage of general news events.<ref name=\"LNS\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/fox-gannett-and-scripps-share-tampa-34870|title=Fox, Gannett and Scripps Share in Tampa|first=Michael|last=Malone|website=Broadcasting & Cable}}</ref> While the news department primarily focuses its local news coverage on [[southeastern Michigan]], it also provides coverage of larger stories in southwestern Ontario, northern Ohio and the rest of Michigan.\n\n===''TV-2 Eyewitness News''===\nThrough much of the 1960s and 1970s WJBK's ''TV-2 [[Eyewitness News]]'' dominated the newscast ratings in the Detroit market.<ref name=\"newsk\">Kiska, Tim. A Newscast for the Masses: The History of Detroit Television News. 2009. Wayne State University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-8143-3302-0}}</ref> This began with [[news presenter|news anchor]] Jac LeGoff and grew when LeGoff was paired with newscaster John Kelly. Other popular longtime Detroit television personalities including Joe Weaver, [[Jerry Hodak]], Van Patrick and Marilyn Turner would also be a part of WJBK's ratings success. The station's ratings would begin to wane in the mid-1970s after then-ABC O&O WXYZ-TV hired away WJBK's and [[WDIV|WWJ-TV]]'s top talent, including Kelly and Turner and eventually LeGoff and Hodak.<ref name=\"newsk\"/> WJBK's newscasts remained competitive in the 1970s with a new stable of talent including anchors Joe Glover, Robbie Timmons, Harry Gallagher, Murray Feldman and [[Terry Murphy (broadcaster)|Terry Murphy]]. The station also had correspondents in bureaus at the Detroit [[Coleman A. Young Municipal Center|City-County Building]] (Louis Miller), the Michigan state capital in Lansing and Washington, D.C.<ref name=\"toledo\"/> Nationally syndicated radio host [[George Noory]] was even a news producer at WJBK from 1974 to 1978, before becoming a [[news director]] at stations in [[Minneapolis]] and [[St. Louis]].<ref name=\"clear\">{{Cite web|url=http://clearchanneloutdoor.com/|title=Clear Channel Outdoor - Innovative Out of Home Advertising Solutions|website=clearchanneloutdoor.com}}</ref> However, by 1980, the station's news ratings steeply declined with the growing dominance of WXYZ. Also by this time WDIV's new owners, [[Post-Newsweek Stations]], were making aggressive changes to bolster its station's image and ratings from third place. By 1982, management at WJBK replaced most of the staff, which sank the station's news ratings further into third place, from where it would almost never recover.<ref name=\"newsk\"/>\n\nWith new management, WJBK's news department saw a resurgence by 1990 with new staff that included Sherry Margolis, Huel Perkins and the rehiring of former anchor Joe Glover. The station would also hire away news staff and talent away from top rated WXYZ including Rich Fisher, Dayna Eubanks, Catherine Lehan, Jerry Hodak and investigative reporter Vince Wade.<ref name=\"soupy\"/> The station revised its image with a new logo, graphics, music and news set and began airing Detroit's first 4 p.m. newscast as part of a three-hour evening news block with half-hour newscasts at 4, 5 and 6 p.m. At the same time, the station also became Detroit's first television station to launch a weekend morning newscast. Overall, WJBK's news ratings would not improve enough to surpass WXYZ and WDIV, which would continue to go head-to-head for first place. The station would also begin to simulcast its late newscast on WADL, which lasted until 1998. It would also be among the first television stations in the country to air obituaries in 1995 during the Detroit newspaper strike.\n\n===''Fox 2 News''===\n[[File:WJBK News Remote Van Novi Michigan.JPG|250px|thumb|right|Fox 2 News Remote Van.]]\nWhen WJBK switched affiliations from CBS to Fox in December 1994, the station adopted a news-intensive format.  It has retained a news schedule similar to the one it had as a CBS affiliate.  The 35-minute 11 p.m. newscast was moved to 10 p.m. and expanded to an hour, and the weekday morning newscast was also expanded. The weekend 6 p.m. newscasts would also be expanded to one hour. WJBK now had a late local newscast in first place as it immediately overtook the hour-long 10 p.m. newscast that WKBD had at the time in the ratings. Eventually, WJBK would drop the 4 p.m. newscast, but the station's profile and ratings for its morning and 10 p.m. newscasts would surge with it out of direct competition from its main competitors WDIV and WXYZ.<ref name=\"newsk\"/> In 1995, the station would hire news anchor Bill Bonds after his departure from WXYZ-TV. Bonds would fill the 11 p.m. timeslot with a news/interview show, ''Bonds Tonight''.<ref name=\"soupy\"/>\n\nThe newscasts were branded as ''Fox 2 Eyewitness News'' until 1997, when Fox took full ownership of the station and rebranded its newscasts as ''Fox 2 News''. By that time, the station would also release its previous WXYZ hires. At the same time, Fox's news management brought on new talent including Dan Miller, Alan Lee and [[Monica Gayle (news anchor)|Monica Gayle]] from Seattle. By 1998, the station would bolster its image by improving its investigative and consumer advocate unit and branding it as ''The Problem Solvers''. It also adopted a slogan complimentary to Detroit's working class heritage, \"''News That Works for You''\". On September 24, 2007, WJBK relaunched an 11 p.m. newscast, using the ''NewsEdge'' format originally used by Fox [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] station [[WTVT]]. It also changed its logo, graphics and news theme to an image that became standard on the Fox O&O stations. In April 2008, the station became the first Fox-owned station (and the third television station in Detroit) to broadcast its news programming in high definition.\n\nOn September 12, 2016, WJBK added an extra half hour to its 6 p.m. newscast.<ref>[https://www.google.com/amp/s/changingnewscasts.wordpress.com/2016/09/02/small-minor-newscast-change-95/amp/?client=safari A small minor newscast change\u2026 #95]</ref>\n\n===Mornings===\nWJBK had a tradition of producing its own morning news shows instead of airing CBS' morning news programs, beginning with a 7:30&nbsp;a.m. newscast in 1969. The newscast would soon expand to an hour starting at 7 a.m. It became a mix of news, interviews and features and would be renamed ''Good Morning, Detroit'' and eventually moved to 8 a.m.<ref name=\"toledo\"/> During its run, Vic Caputo would co-anchor separately with Beverly Payne, Ken Ford and Kathy O'Brien. Payne would be the first African-American female news anchor in Detroit.<ref name=\"soupy\"/> ''Good Morning, Detroit'' eventually became ''Morning Magazine'', hosted by Kathy O'Brien and Gary Cubberly. In 1982, ''Morning Magazine'' was discontinued and briefly became ''Two's Company'', also hosted by O'Brien and Cubberly. In 1992, the station preempted CBS' morning news program again when WJBK rehired Jerry Hodak from WXYZ to co-anchor ''Eyewitness News Morning''. Just prior to that, WJBK also debuted Detroit's first weekend morning newscast, which was first anchored by former ''PM Magazine'' host Gary Cubberly. Competitor WDIV would follow with its own weekend morning newscast, as did eventually WXYZ. Since then, the station has broadcast more morning news hours than any other Detroit television station. In September 2009, the morning newscast was expanded to 5\u00bd hours, airing from 4:30 to 10 a.m. In September 2011, ''Fox 2 News Morning'' expanded to 6\u00bd hours from 4:30 to 11 a.m., where it joins the station's hour-long midday newscast at 11 a.m. WJBK has also had the longest-running midday newscast in the Detroit market, which originated in 1966 in the noon timeslot, before moving to 11 a.m. shortly after the switch to Fox.<ref name=\"hodak\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/JERRY+HODAK+JOINS+WJBK-TV+2-a012559293|title=Jerry Hodak joins WJBK-TV 2, WJBK, PRNewswire}}</ref>\n\nOn May 6, 2015, WJBK's morning show became the subject of notoriety for a [[blooper]], wherein an anchor innuendously declared a hope for a \"[[dry hump]] day\".<ref name=metro-dryhumpday>{{cite web|title=A Fox News anchor said \u2018dry hump\u2019 live on TV and her co-host had the best reaction|url=http://metro.co.uk/2015/05/07/a-fox-news-anchor-said-dry-hump-live-on-tv-and-her-co-host-had-the-best-reaction-5185823/|website=Metro (UK)|accessdate=May 8, 2015}}</ref><ref name=nydn-dryhumpday>{{cite web|title=SEE IT: Detroit TV anchor stuns co-workers, weatherman by hoping for \u2018dry hump day\u2019|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/detroit-tv-anchor-hopes-dry-hump-day-article-1.2215020|website=New York Daily News|accessdate=May 8, 2015}}</ref> In the fall of 2018, WJBK begin expanding its current morning newscasts to 8 hours with addition of half-hour starting at 4 a.m.\n\n===Ratings===\nAs of February 2012, WJBK's ''Fox 2 News Morning'' has consistently remained the Detroit market's highest rated local morning newscast (6\u20137 a.m., 4.5 rating/17 share). After years of faltering at a distant third against WDIV and WXYZ, WJBK began to make gains in its audience growth in other newscasts. While WDIV continued to have the most-watched evening and late newscasts, WJBK's 10 p.m. news (7.5 rating/12 share) remains the highest-rated prime time newscast in [[Metro Detroit]]. Its early evening 5 and 5:30&nbsp;p.m. newscasts (6.0/13) have surpassed WXYZ-TV's longtime dominant 5 p.m. newscast (5.8/13) for second place. While WJBK's 6 p.m. newscast (5.1/10) has become a very close third moving within one rating point to WXYZ's newscast in that timeslot (6.1/12).

WFQX would also air the second half of WJBK's 10 p.m. newscast following its own half-hour 10 p.m. newscast.

In the field several mechanisms of resistance have been identified. The evolution of fungicide resistance can be gradual or sudden. In qualitative or discrete resistance, a [[mutation]] (normally to a single gene) produces a [[Race (biology)|race]] of a fungus with a high degree of resistance. Such resistant varieties also tend to show stability, persisting after the fungicide has been removed from the market. For example, [[sugar beet]] leaf blotch remains resistant to [[azole]]s years after they were no longer used for control of the disease. This is because such mutations have a high [[selection pressure]] when the fungicide is used, but there is low selection pressure to remove them in the absence of the fungicide.\n\nIn instances where resistance occurs more gradually, a shift in sensitivity in the pathogen to the fungicide can be seen. Such resistance is [[Polygenic trait|polygenic]] \u2013 an accumulation of many mutations in different genes, each having a small additive effect. This type of resistance is known as quantitative or continuous resistance. In this kind of resistance, the pathogen population will revert to a sensitive state if the fungicide is no longer applied.\n\nLittle is known about how variations in fungicide treatment affect the selection pressure to evolve resistance to that fungicide. Evidence shows that the doses that provide the most control of the disease also provide the largest selection pressure to acquire resistance, and that lower doses decrease the selection pressure.<ref>Metcalfe, R.J. ''et al.'' (2000) The effect of dose and mobility on the strength of selection for DMI (sterol demethylation inhibitors) fungicide resistance in inoculated field experiments. ''Plant Pathology'' '''49''': 546\u2013557</ref>\n\nIn some cases when a pathogen evolves resistance to one fungicide, it automatically obtains resistance to others \u2013 a phenomenon known as [[cross resistance]]. These additional fungicides are normally of the same chemical family or have the same mode of action, or can be detoxified by the same mechanism. Sometimes negative cross resistance occurs, where resistance to one chemical class of fungicides leads to an increase in sensitivity to a different chemical class of fungicides. This has been seen with [[carbendazim]] and [https://biologyteach.com/type-of-fungicides/ diethofencarb].\n\nThere are also recorded incidences of the evolution of [[multiple drug resistance]] by pathogens \u2013 resistance to two chemically different fungicides by separate mutation events. For example, ''[[Botrytis cinerea]]'' is resistant to both azoles and [[dicarboximide fungicides]].\n\nThere are several routes by which pathogens can evolve fungicide resistance. The most common mechanism appears to be alteration of the target site, in particular as a defence against single site of action fungicides. For example, [[Black Sigatoka]], an economically important pathogen of banana, is resistant to the [[QoI]] fungicides, due to a single [[nucleotide]] change resulting in the replacement of one [[amino acid]] (glycine) by another (alanine) in the target protein of the QoI fungicides, [[cytochrome]] b.<ref>Sierotzki, Helge (2000) Mode of resistance to respiration inhibitors at the cytochrome bc1 enzyme complex of Mycosphaerella fijiensis field isolates ''Pest Management Science'' '''56''':833\u2013841</ref> It is presumed that this disrupts the binding of the fungicide to the protein, rendering the fungicide ineffective. Upregulation of target genes can also render the fungicide ineffective. This is seen in DMI-resistant strains of ''[[Venturia inaequalis]]''.<ref>Schnabel, G., and Jones, A. L. 2001. The 14a-demethylase (CYP51A1) gene is overexpressed in ''V. inaequalis'' strains resistant to myclobutanil. ''Phytopathology'' '''91''':102\u2013110.</ref>\n\nResistance to fungicides can also be developed by efficient [[Efflux (microbiology)|efflux]] of the fungicide out of the cell. ''[[Septoria tritici]]'' has developed multiple drug resistance using this mechanism. The pathogen had five [[ATP-binding cassette transporter|ABC-type transporters]] with overlapping [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] specificities that together work to pump toxic chemicals out of the cell.<ref>Zwiers, L. H. et al. (2003) ABC transporters of the wheat pathogen Mycosphaerella graminicola function as protectants against biotic and xenobiotic toxic compounds. ''Molecular Genetics and Genomics'' '''269''':499\u2013507</ref>\n\nIn addition to the mechanisms outlined above, fungi may also develop [[metabolic pathway]]s that circumvent the target protein, or acquire [[enzyme]]s that enable metabolism of the fungicide to a harmless substance.\n\n===Fungicide resistance management===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2009}}\n\nThe fungicide resistance action committee (FRAC) has several recommended practices to try to avoid the development of fungicide resistance, especially in at-risk fungicides including ''Strobilurins'' such as [[azoxystrobin]].\n\nProducts should not be used in isolation, but rather as mixture, or alternate sprays, with another fungicide with a different mechanism of action. The likelihood of the pathogen's developing resistance is greatly decreased by the fact that any resistant isolates to one fungicide will be killed by the other; in other words, two mutations would be required rather than just one. The effectiveness of this technique can be demonstrated by [[Metalaxyl]], a [[phenylamide]] fungicide. When used as the sole product in [[Ireland]] to control potato blight (''[[Phytophthora infestans]]''), resistance developed within one growing season. However, in countries like the [[UK]] where it was marketed only as a mixture, resistance problems developed more slowly.\n\nFungicides should be applied only when absolutely necessary, especially if they are in an at-risk group. Lowering the amount of fungicide in the environment lowers the selection pressure for resistance to develop.\n\nManufacturers\u2019 [[Dose (biochemistry)|dose]]s should always be followed. These doses are normally designed to give the right balance between controlling the disease and limiting the risk of resistance development.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Higher doses increase the selection pressure for single-site mutations that confer resistance, as all strains but those that carry the mutation will be eliminated, and thus the resistant strain will propagate. Lower doses greatly increase the risk of polygenic resistance, as strains that are slightly less sensitive to the fungicide may survive.\n\nIt is better to use an [[Integrated pest management|integrative pest management]] approach to disease control rather than relying on fungicides alone. This involves the use of resistant varieties and hygienic practices, such as the removal of potato discard piles and stubble on which the pathogen can overwinter, greatly reducing the titre of the pathogen and thus the risk of fungicide resistance development.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Antifungal drug]]\n*[[Index of pesticide articles]]\n*[[List of fungicides]]\n*[[PHI-base]] (Pathogen-Host-Interaction database)\n*[[Phytopathology]]\n*[[Plant disease forecasting]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.frac.info Fungicide Resistance Action Committee]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071223002409/http://frag.csl.gov.uk/cropspecific.cfm Fungicide Resistance Action Group], United Kingdom\n*[https://biologyteach.com/type-of-fungicides/ Type of Fungicides]BiologyTeach,Pakistan\n*[http://npic.orst.edu/gen.htm General Pesticide Information] - National Pesticide Information Center, Oregon State University, United States\n\n{{pesticides}}\n{{Horticulture and Gardening}}\n\n[[Category:Fungicides| ]]\n[[Category:Mycology]]\n[[Category:Biocides]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=December 2009}}\n\n'''Fungicides''' are [[biocide|biocidal]] [[chemical compound]]s or biological organisms used to kill [[parasitism#Parasitic fungi|parasitic fungi]] or their [[spore]]s.<ref>[https://doi.org/10.1007%2FBF02015493 Interaction of 2,4,5-trich|orophenylsulphonylmethyl thiocyanate with fungal spores]</ref> A [[fungistatic]] inhibits their growth.

In the field several mechanisms of resistance have been identified. The evolution of fungicide resistance can be gradual or sudden. In qualitative or discrete resistance, a [[mutation]] (normally to a single gene) produces a [[Race (biology)|race]] of a fungus with a high degree of resistance. Such resistant varieties also tend to show stability, persisting after the fungicide has been removed from the market. For example, [[sugar beet]] leaf blotch remains resistant to [[azole]]s years after they were no longer used for control of the disease. This is because such mutations have a high [[selection pressure]] when the fungicide is used, but there is low selection pressure to remove them in the absence of the fungicide.\n\nIn instances where resistance occurs more gradually, a shift in sensitivity in the pathogen to the fungicide can be seen. Such resistance is [[Polygenic trait|polygenic]] \u2013 an accumulation of many mutations in different genes, each having a small additive effect. This type of resistance is known as quantitative or continuous resistance. In this kind of resistance, the pathogen population will revert to a sensitive state if the fungicide is no longer applied.\n\nLittle is known about how variations in fungicide treatment affect the selection pressure to evolve resistance to that fungicide. Evidence shows that the doses that provide the most control of the disease also provide the largest selection pressure to acquire resistance, and that lower doses decrease the selection pressure.<ref>Metcalfe, R.J. ''et al.'' (2000) The effect of dose and mobility on the strength of selection for DMI (sterol demethylation inhibitors) fungicide resistance in inoculated field experiments. ''Plant Pathology'' '''49''': 546\u2013557</ref>\n\nIn some cases when a pathogen evolves resistance to one fungicide, it automatically obtains resistance to others \u2013 a phenomenon known as [[cross resistance]]. These additional fungicides are normally of the same chemical family or have the same mode of action, or can be detoxified by the same mechanism. Sometimes negative cross resistance occurs, where resistance to one chemical class of fungicides leads to an increase in sensitivity to a different chemical class of fungicides. This has been seen with [[carbendazim]] and [[diethofencarb]].\n\nThere are also recorded incidences of the evolution of [[multiple drug resistance]] by pathogens \u2013 resistance to two chemically different fungicides by separate mutation events. For example, ''[[Botrytis cinerea]]'' is resistant to both azoles and [[dicarboximide fungicides]].\n\nThere are several routes by which pathogens can evolve fungicide resistance. The most common mechanism appears to be alteration of the target site, in particular as a defence against single site of action fungicides. For example, [[Black Sigatoka]], an economically important pathogen of banana, is resistant to the [[QoI]] fungicides, due to a single [[nucleotide]] change resulting in the replacement of one [[amino acid]] (glycine) by another (alanine) in the target protein of the QoI fungicides, [[cytochrome]] b.<ref>Sierotzki, Helge (2000) Mode of resistance to respiration inhibitors at the cytochrome bc1 enzyme complex of Mycosphaerella fijiensis field isolates ''Pest Management Science'' '''56''':833\u2013841</ref> It is presumed that this disrupts the binding of the fungicide to the protein, rendering the fungicide ineffective. Upregulation of target genes can also render the fungicide ineffective. This is seen in DMI-resistant strains of ''[[Venturia inaequalis]]''.<ref>Schnabel, G., and Jones, A. L. 2001. The 14a-demethylase (CYP51A1) gene is overexpressed in ''V. inaequalis'' strains resistant to myclobutanil. ''Phytopathology'' '''91''':102\u2013110.</ref>\n\nResistance to fungicides can also be developed by efficient [[Efflux (microbiology)|efflux]] of the fungicide out of the cell. ''[[Septoria tritici]]'' has developed multiple drug resistance using this mechanism. The pathogen had five [[ATP-binding cassette transporter|ABC-type transporters]] with overlapping [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] specificities that together work to pump toxic chemicals out of the cell.<ref>Zwiers, L. H. et al. (2003) ABC transporters of the wheat pathogen Mycosphaerella graminicola function as protectants against biotic and xenobiotic toxic compounds. ''Molecular Genetics and Genomics'' '''269''':499\u2013507</ref>\n\nIn addition to the mechanisms outlined above, fungi may also develop [[metabolic pathway]]s that circumvent the target protein, or acquire [[enzyme]]s that enable metabolism of the fungicide to a harmless substance.\n\n===Fungicide resistance management===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2009}}\n\nThe fungicide resistance action committee (FRAC) has several recommended practices to try to avoid the development of fungicide resistance, especially in at-risk fungicides including ''Strobilurins'' such as [[azoxystrobin]].\n\nProducts should not be used in isolation, but rather as mixture, or alternate sprays, with another fungicide with a different mechanism of action. The likelihood of the pathogen's developing resistance is greatly decreased by the fact that any resistant isolates to one fungicide will be killed by the other; in other words, two mutations would be required rather than just one. The effectiveness of this technique can be demonstrated by [[Metalaxyl]], a [[phenylamide]] fungicide. When used as the sole product in [[Ireland]] to control potato blight (''[[Phytophthora infestans]]''), resistance developed within one growing season. However, in countries like the [[UK]] where it was marketed only as a mixture, resistance problems developed more slowly.\n\nFungicides should be applied only when absolutely necessary, especially if they are in an at-risk group. Lowering the amount of fungicide in the environment lowers the selection pressure for resistance to develop.\n\nManufacturers\u2019 [[Dose (biochemistry)|dose]]s should always be followed. These doses are normally designed to give the right balance between controlling the disease and limiting the risk of resistance development.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Higher doses increase the selection pressure for single-site mutations that confer resistance, as all strains but those that carry the mutation will be eliminated, and thus the resistant strain will propagate. Lower doses greatly increase the risk of polygenic resistance, as strains that are slightly less sensitive to the fungicide may survive.\n\nIt is better to use an [[Integrated pest management|integrative pest management]] approach to disease control rather than relying on fungicides alone. This involves the use of resistant varieties and hygienic practices, such as the removal of potato discard piles and stubble on which the pathogen can overwinter, greatly reducing the titre of the pathogen and thus the risk of fungicide resistance development.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Antifungal drug]]\n*[[Index of pesticide articles]]\n*[[List of fungicides]]\n*[[PHI-base]] (Pathogen-Host-Interaction database)\n*[[Phytopathology]]\n*[[Plant disease forecasting]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.frac.info Fungicide Resistance Action Committee]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071223002409/http://frag.csl.gov.uk/cropspecific.cfm Fungicide Resistance Action Group], United Kingdom\n*[http://npic.orst.edu/gen.htm General Pesticide Information] - National Pesticide Information Center, Oregon State University, United States\n\n{{pesticides}}\n{{Horticulture and Gardening}}\n\n[[Category:Fungicides| ]]\n[[Category:Mycology]]\n[[Category:Biocides]]\n", "name_user": "Ramzan4117", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(I Added a external link)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungicide"}

The line runs for {{convert|172|km}}, connects the capital city [[Wellington]] with the [[Palmerston North - Gisborne Line]] at [[Woodville, New Zealand|Woodville]], via [[Lower Hutt]], [[Upper Hutt]] and [[Masterton]].\n\nThe first part of the line opened in 1874 between Wellington and Lower Hutt, with the entire line to Woodville completed in 1897. It was the only [[New Zealand Railways Department|New Zealand Government Railways]] route out of Wellington until 1908, when the government bought out the [[Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company]] who owned and operated the present [[North Island Main Trunk]] section between Wellington and Palmerston North. The line originally included the famous [[Rimutaka Incline]], which used the [[Fell mountain railway system]] to cross the [[Rimutaka Range]] between Upper Hutt and [[Featherston, New Zealand|Featherston]]. In the mid-1950s, the line between Petone and Featherston was substantially realigned, with the line diverted to the east of the Hutt River between Petone and Haywards to serve new housing developments in northern Lower Hutt, and the construction of the [[Rimutaka Tunnel]] to replace the Rimutaka Incline. Part of the former route west of the Hutt River has been retained as the [[Melling Branch]].\n\nThe southern portion of the line between Wellington and Upper Hutt is electrified and is also known as the [[Hutt Valley Line]]. [[Transdev]] on behalf of the [[Greater Wellington Regional Council]] runs suburban services along the Hutt Valley section, as well as the [[Wairarapa Connection]] service between Wellington and Masterton. [[KiwiRail]] runs regular freight services along the line between Wellington to Masterton and between Pahiatua and Woodville. No regular services currently run along the Masterton to Pahiatua section, and this section is currently under review as part of [[KiwiRail#Turn-around plan|KiwiRail's turnaround plan]].\n\nThe [[Sixth Labour Government of New Zealand#Transport and Infrastructure|Labour government]] promised during the 2017 election campaign to upgrade the track to improve operation of the [[Wairarapa Connection]], and on 9 October 2018 the minister [[Phil Twyford]] announced that the proposed $196 million for the region included $96 million for the Wairarapa Line; $50 million in the Wairarapa and $46.2 million south of the Rimutaka Tunnel including double-tracking the Trentham to Upper Hutt section. Work is to start in April 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/rail-upgrades-big-win-wairarapa |title= Rail upgrades a big win for the Wairarapa |publisher= The Beehive |date= 9 October 2018}}</ref> The double-tracking will be completed in 2021. Other \"infrastructure renewals\" on the line include three bridges with timber elements and track renewal (including in the Rimutaka Tunnel) but no signals renewal.

In 1853 and 1857, investigation of horse-hauled [[tramway (mineral)|tramways]] was undertaken, but no action was taken. [[Robert Stokes (politician)|Robert Stokes]], a member of the [[Wellington Province|provincial government]], proposed a railway over the Rimutakas in 1858 and finally succeeded in gaining government interest in 1863. The Wellington Provincial Government established a committee to investigate proposals, and on 2 July 1866 it passed the Wellington, Hutt and Wairarapa Railway Ordinance.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.nzlii.org/nz/legis/wgn_ord/whawro1866437/ |title= Wellington, Hutt and Wairarapa Railway Ordinance, 1866 |publisher= New Zealand Law online |date= 1866 }}</ref> The act authorised a railway employing either {{RailGauge|3ft6in|lk=on}} or {{RailGauge|sg|allk=on}} to carry 200 tonnes at speeds of {{convert|24|km/h}}, but construction did not commence as sufficient funds were not available in the fledgling New Zealand colony, nor were they successfully raised in [[England]].\n\nIn 1870 [[Julius Vogel]] included a Wellington-Wairarapa railway in his [[Vogel Era|Great Public Works Policy]] and visited [[London]] to arrange a loan to finance the policy. On this trip he was approached by several contracting firms and a contract that included the first section of the Wairarapa Line was awarded to [[John Brogden and Sons|Brogden & Sons]]. The construction of the line can be considered in three stages: the [[Hutt Valley]] section, the route over the Rimutakas, and the line through the Wairarapa via [[Masterton]] to [[Woodville, New Zealand|Woodville]].\n\n===Hutt Valley section===\n{{further|Hutt Valley Line}}\n\nOn 20 August 1872 construction of the Wairarapa Line began with the turning of the first sod at [[Pipitea Point]], the site of Wellington's first railway station. Construction was delayed due to the difficulties associated with building a railway along the narrow, rocky shoreline of [[Wellington Harbour]], and the section to [[Lower Hutt]] was not opened until 14 April 1874. Further difficulties were encountered in building the rest of the route up the Hutt Valley along the [[Hutt River, New Zealand|Hutt River]]'s western bank, including the need to divert the river and reinforce its bank in places. On 1 February 1876 the line opened to [[Upper Hutt]].\n\n===Rimutaka section===\n[[File:Fell Engine Museum - 2002-03-20.jpg|left|thumb|One of the special locomotives employed on the Rimutaka Incline, [[NZR H class|H 199]], now preserved at the [[Fell Engine Museum]].]]\n\n{{further|Rimutaka Incline}}\n\nThe Rimutaka Range posed a severe difficulty to those involved in planning and constructing the Wairarapa Line. On 1 January 1878 the Hutt line opened to [[Kaitoke railway station|Kaitoke]] at the western foot of the range, and a steep but manageable route with a grade of 1 in 39-40 was found from Kaitoke up the [[Pakuratahi River]] valley to the site of Summit station, {{convert|348|m}} above sea level. However, from Summit down the eastern slope to [[Cross Creek railway station|Cross Creek]] near [[Featherston railway station|Featherston]], a gradient of 1 in 14-16 was required. This was far too steep for regular [[steam locomotive]]s to handle, and accordingly the Fell mountain railway system was employed. This used a centre rail to which specially-designed locomotives and brake vans clung, allowing them to climb the steep slope upwards or control the descent. Despite the terrain, construction of this unique route was completed swiftly, opening to Featherston on 12 October 1878.\n\n===South Wairarapa section===\nConstruction from Featherston to Masterton across the Wairarapa plains north of [[Lake Wairarapa]] was relatively easy. The decision was taken to bypass [[Greytown, New Zealand|Greytown]] and build the line through [[Woodside, New Zealand|Woodside]] to bridge the [[Waiohine River]] at a point far enough up the river to be considered safe; a line through Greytown would have required a bridge at a point considered unsafe by the surveyors. The [[Greytown Branch]] was constructed from Woodside, and Greytown was briefly the effective terminus of the Wairarapa Line from the opening of the branch on 14 May 1880 until the bridging of the Waiohine a month later. Later in 1880 the line opened all the way through to Masterton.\n\n===North Wairarapa section===\nThe northern Wairarapa was more rugged and isolated, and construction was slower and more difficult. [[Mauriceville, New Zealand|Mauriceville]], {{convert|20|km}} north of Masterton, was reached on 14 June 1886, followed by the next {{convert|6|km}} to [[Mangamahoe]] on 10 January 1887. The {{convert|10|km}} between Mangamahoe and [[Eketahuna]] included the {{convert|150|m|adj=on}} long Wiwaka tunnel, the only tunnel between the Rimutaka Incline and Woodville, and the section was opened on 8 April 1889. Construction of the {{convert|4|km}} section to [[Newman, New Zealand|Newman]] was inexplicably slow, not completed until 1896. [[Pahiatua]] was reached in May 1897, including the [[Mangatainoka River]] bridge, the longest bridge on the line at {{convert|162|m}}. Mangatainoka is {{convert|24|km}} from the bridge and the railway reached it in August 1897, and the line was finally opened to Woodville and a junction with the [[Palmerston North - Gisborne Line]] on 11 December 1897.\n\n===Branch Lines===\nFour [[branch line]]s diverge from the Wairarapa Line: the [[Melling Branch]] and the [[Gracefield Branch]] to [[Hutt Workshops]], both still open; the [[Greytown Branch]], closed in 1953, and the [[Hutt Park Railway]], which ceased serving its intended purpose in 1906 but survived in truncated form as an [[Rail siding|industrial siding]] until 1982.  At one time a branch line to [[Martinborough Branch|Martinborough]] was proposed but this line never eventuated.\n\n==Deviations==\nSeveral upgrades and alterations to the Wairarapa Line have been made, but only the Western Hutt and Rimutaka tunnel deviations have significantly altered its route.\n\n===Hutt deviation===\n{{further|Hutt Valley Line|Melling Branch}}\n\nIn 1925 construction began on what was then known as the '''Hutt Valley Branch''', leaving the main line just north of [[Petone]] station and running east to [[Waterloo, New Zealand|Waterloo]], opening on 26 May 1927. After [[World War II]], new [[state housing]] suburbs developed north of Waterloo, and the railway was extended to serve them. In 1954 it re-joined the western line south of [[Manor Park, New Zealand|Manor Park]] and superseded the old route. On 1 March 1954 the former Hutt Valley Branch became part of the Wairarapa Line and the western route was truncated into the [[Melling Branch]] from Petone.\n\n===Silversteam deviation===\nThe deviation included a new bridge across the Hutt River, replacing a section of line now used by [[Silver Stream Railway]]\n\n===Rimutaka deviation===\n{{further|Rimutaka Tunnel}}\n\nThe Rimutaka Incline was difficult, costly and time-consuming to operate, but as the Wairarapa Line had become a secondary route since the acquisition of the Wellington and Manawatu Railway in 1908, its replacement was not a priority. Various alternate systems and routes were debated, with a tunnel chosen in 1936. However, the economic conditions left from the [[Great Depression]] followed by the impact of World War II meant that work on the tunnel did not start until 1948. The Incline and the line up the western side of the Rimutakas closed on 29 October 1955 and the tunnel opened on 3 November 1955.\n\n==Operation==\n\n===Passenger services===\n{{main|Wairarapa Connection}}\nWhen the full line opened in 1897, passenger services from the Hutt Valley to Wellington were augmented by NZR's first express from Wellington, the [[Napier Express]] (the WMR had operated the Wellington-[[Longburn]] portion of the [[New Plymouth Express]]). After the acquisition of the WMR, the Napier Express was re-routed to the quicker west coast route in early 1909 and the [[Wairarapa Mail]] was introduced to provide a regular service through the Wairarapa to Woodville. In 1936, [[NZR RM class|RM class]] [[NZR RM class (Wairarapa)|Wairarapa]] [[railcar]]s were introduced; these were designed to operate at speed over the Rimutaka Incline and provided a much quicker service to Wellington and local Wairarapa services. They originally augmented the Wairarapa Mail but replaced it in 1948. Carriage trains operated only at peak times of the year when the railcar capacity was exceeded; in 1955, the Incline's closure meant the Wairarapa railcars were withdrawn and [[NZR RM class (88 seater)|88 seater railcars]] were introduced, boosting capacity at off-peak times. One Wairarapa railcar has survived and is currently under restoration by the [[Pahiatua Railcar Society]]. [[Mixed train]]s also operated until the 1950s.\n\n[[File:Electric Locomotives Near Paekakariki.jpg|left|thumb|EW 1805, which operated on the Hutt Valley Line. It survived for preservation and is seen here with [[NZR DC class|DC]] 4611 near [[Paekakariki]] on the [[North Island Main Trunk Railway]].]]\n\nIn the 1950s the Hutt Valley line was electrified using the 1500 V DC system already operating to [[Johnsonville, New Zealand|Johnsonville]] and [[Paekakariki]]. The electrification was opened to [[Taita, New Zealand|Taita]] on 12 October 1953 and Upper Hutt on 24 July 1955, allowing for a more intensive suburban commuter service to Wellington. Originally operated by [[NZR DM class|DM/D class]] [[electric multiple unit]]s and carriage trains hauled by [[NZR ED class|ED]] and [[NZR EW class|EW class]] electric locomotives, the carriage trains and many of the DM/D units were phased out upon the introduction of the [[NZR EM class|\"Ganz-Mavag\" EM/ET class]] units in the early 1980s. The [[New Zealand FP class electric multiple unit|\"Matangi\" FP/FT class]] was introduced on the Hutt Valley Line in 2011\u201312, initially relegating the Ganz Mavag units to peak services only before being completely replacing them from 2015.\n\nProposals have been made to extend the electrification into the Wairarapa and the Rimutaka Tunnel was constructed to allow overhead lines to be installed, although before opening diesel operation was adopted. In 2007, the Greater Wellington Regional Council rejected a call for the line to be electrified to Masterton, stating that patronage was too low to justify the capital expenditure.<ref name=\"electric\">{{cite news |last1=Farmer |first1=Don |date={{date|July 12, 2007}} |title=Wairarapa rail won't go electric |url=http://www.times-age.co.nz/news/wairarapa-rail-wont-go-electric/980824/ |work= |location=[[Masterton]] |publisher=[[Wairarapa Times-Age]] |publication-date=12 July 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415103820/http://www.times-age.co.nz/news/wairarapa-rail-wont-go-electric/980824/ |archive-date={{date|April 15, 2012}} |access-date=21 December 2011 |ref= }}</ref>\n\nRailcar services were withdrawn in 1977, and carriage trains were re-instated progressively from early 1964. Until 1963, a railcar service operated on Friday evenings between Masterton and Woodville, and in December that year the decision was taken to replace the morning railcar to Wellington with a carriage train as over 200 passengers wished to use the railcar service that had a capacity of just 176. The final railcar service was replaced by carriage trains in December 1977; some of the carriage trains from this point until the mid-1980s were made up of de-motorised former 88-seater railcars known as \"[[NZR RM class (88 seater)#Grassgrubs|grassgrubs]]\" in [[List of NZ railfan jargon|New Zealand railfan jargon]]. Passenger services through the lowly populated northern Wairarapa survived due to the poor roads in the area, but as they were improved, demand for the trains declined. Masterton \u2013 Palmerston North passenger trains ceased from Monday, 1 August 1988{{sfn|Bromby|2003|p=40|ps=&nbsp;\"Passenger services on the 80.5 km Masterton\u2013Woodville section ended from 1 August 1988\"}} with the last such service running on Friday, 29 July.{{sfn|Churchman & Hurst|2001|p=160}} In the 1990s, the service between Masterton and Wellington was rebranded as the [[Wairarapa Connection]] and presently operates five times each way weekdays (with a sixth service in the evening on Fridays), and twice each way on weekends and public holidays. In 2007, eighteen new [[New Zealand British Rail Mark 2 carriage|SW class]] carriages were introduced to replace the [[NZR 56-foot carriage|56ft carriages]] used since the service's inception; in 2013, they were joined by the six SE class to relieve capacity constraints especially on evening services.\n\nThe 2020-2021 ($300 million) Wellington Metro Rail Upgrade work started in November 2019 and is expected to take eighteen months. The single-track Trentham-Upper Hutt section is to be double-tracked, and will be equipped for bi-directional signalling so that trains can run on either track in either direction between Upper Hutt and Trentham (and possibly later to Heretaunga). The work is expected to improve the operation of both suburban passenger trains to Upper Hutt and the [[Wairarapa Connection]], with a longer loop at Upper Hutt to hold Wairarapa log trains.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Wellington Rail Upgrades|journal=The New Zealand Railway Observer|date=February\u2013March 2020|number=|p=251\u2013252|volume=76| issue = 6}}</ref>\n\n===Freight services===\nUntil the acquisition of the WMR in December 1908 all NZR freight out of Wellington was carried on the Wairarapa Line. As soon as the western route became available, all freight that could be diverted off the Wairarapa Line was diverted, due to the difficulties created by the Rimutaka Incline. This meant that even some traffic from the northern Wairarapa was sent through the [[Manawatu Gorge]] and down the west coast to Wellington. The opening of the Rimutaka Tunnel made the line more desirable for through freight traffic, but as localised freight gave way to containerised inter-city freight in the 1980s, the significance of the Wairarapa Line declined, especially on the section north of Masterton.\n\nKiwiRail is currently investigating a log shipment hub in Masterton that would mean log traffic would use the northern portion of the Wairarapa Line, from Masterton to Napier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/5442814/KiwiRail-in-talks-to-revive-Wairarapa-rail-line|title=KiwiRail in talks to revive Wairarapa rail line|date=15 August 2011|accessdate=15 August 2011|author=Matt Stewart|publisher=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]]}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2012 it was reported that the total freight carried on the northern section of the line had increased from 74,031 tonnes in 2009 to 97,139 tonnes in 2011, although this figure was inflated by a ten-day closure of the Manawatu Gorge section of the railway line due to a slip.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/manawatu-standard/news/6374796/Pahiatua-rail-link-looking-up|title=Pahiatua rail link looking up|publisher=[[Manawatu Standard]]|date=8 February 2012|accessdate=8 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nPresently freight services operate at each end of the line. Log and other wood-related traffic is moved between Wellington and [[Waingawa railway station|Waingawa]], just south of Masterton, with one overnight and one daylight return service on weekdays, and a daylight service operates both weekend days. Two freight trains operate from Palmerston North to Pahiatua and return on weekdays, the first in the early hours of the morning and the second in the afternoon. No freights currently operate regularly at weekends.\n\nKiwiRail ceased running timetabled revenue services on the Masterton\u2013Pahiatua section of the line in February 2015, transferring the Sunday Wellington to Palmerston North via Woodville run to the NIMT.  However, they have undertaken to keep it open and maintain it to an operational standard, in part because it is still in use by heritage operators,<ref name=\"Line to Pahiatua stays open\">{{cite news |last1=Yong |first1=Alisa |date=3 June 2015 |title=Line to Pahiatua stays open |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/wairarapa-times-age/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503414&objectid=11458882 |department= |newspaper=Wairarapa Times-Age |location=Masterton |publisher=NZME.

They were augmented by members of the [[NZR M class|M]] and [[NZR N class|N]] classes. In the twentieth century, typical locomotives included members of the [[NZR A class (1906)|A]] and [[NZR Ab class|A<sup>B</sup>]] class. The Rimutaka Incline was almost always operated by the six members of the [[NZR H class|H class]] built specifically for it. In 1906 [[NZR E class (1906)|E 66]] was built for the Incline but did not prove as successful as the six H locomotives and was retired in 1917.\n\nWhen the Rimutaka Tunnel opened in November 1955, the Wairarapa Line became the first in New Zealand to be fully [[dieselisation|dieselised]] as steam locomotives were unable to pass through the tunnel. Initially, [[NZR DE class|DE]] and [[New Zealand DG and DH class locomotive|DG]] class diesels were employed, and they were soon joined by the [[New Zealand DA class locomotive|DA class]]. Until 1967, the Wairarapa Line was the only way DA class locomotives could access Wellington due to tunnels south of Paekakariki being too small. In the 1980s, the DG class had been fully withdrawn and the DA class in the process of withdrawal or conversion to the [[NZR DC class|DC class]]; accordingly motive power on the Wairarapa Line changed. Until 2015, the DC class was the mainstay of the Wairarapa line south of Masterton, with locomotives of the [[NZR DBR class|DBR]], [[New Zealand DF class locomotive (1979)|DF/DFT]] and [[New Zealand DX class locomotive|DX]] classes occasionally used. In July 2015, the DFT class took over services on the line.<ref>{{cite news |first= Emily |last= Norman |date= 2 July 2015 |title= Faster locos mean timely rides - council |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/wairarapa-times-age/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503414&objectid=11474493 |publisher= [[Wairarapa Times-Age]] |accessdate= 24 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nAs of May 2016, rolling stock regularly used on the Wairarapa Line include:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#f9f9f9;\"\n!

Signalling at Petone is future-proofed for conversion to a fifth system, Automatic Signalling Rules (ASR).\n\nThe Wairarapa Line had a number of lasts for railway signalling in New Zealand\n* [[Railway semaphore signal|Semaphore Signal]] on an operational line, these were decommissioned in 1996 however the masts (poles) remained in place until July 2014.\n* Line controlled by ''[[Tyers Electric Train Tablet]]''\n* Manned signal box outside of a major station\n\nPrior to the Trentham\u2013Upper Hutt\u2013Featherston section being transferred to Train Control in February 2007, this was the last section with CTC controlled by a [[signalman (rail)|signalman]]. Part-time signal boxes remained at Petone (weekday peak and inter-peak) and at Taita (weekday peak) until December 2013 and July 2014 respectively, when signalling was switched to Train Control in central Wellington.\n\nMasterton is a unique signalling arrangement with Track Warrant Control ending at 'TWC Ends' boards north of the two-position home signal, which allows shunting movements to be carried out without the need for a Track Warrant. Along with [[Horotiu railway station|Horotiu]] (on the NIMT between Te Rapa and Ng\u0101ruaw\u0101hia) Masterton still has Woods Points Keys.

The sidings remain at Taratahi but the main line points were removed around 2003 (Ravensdown Fertiliser). Lime Works at Mauriceville are also still connected to the network but are overgrown and covered with lime.

Other former sidings include one used by oil companies between Renall St and Masterton stations; disused sidings at Mauriceville and Eketahuna; the Ngauranga Industrial Siding to an abattoir in the Ngauranga Gorge; and a siding to the [[Featherston Military Camp]] north of Featherston during World War I.\n\n===Tunnels===\nNine tunnels have been constructed on the various routes of the Wairarapa Line. Of these, only three are now in use for railway purposes, and only the Wiwaka tunnel in northern Wairarapa (150m; between Mangamahoe & Eketahuna) has remained unaffected by deviations since the line opened.\n\nFive of these tunnels are now part of the Rimutaka Rail Trail: Mangaroa, Pakuratahi, Summit, Siberia and Prices. The Rimutaka Incline Railway project hopes to incorporate these tunnels into its restored railway line across the Rimutaka Ranges.\n\n====Original route====\nFrom Wellington to Woodville:\n* Cruickshanks Tunnel (120m) \n* Mangaroa Tunnel (152m)\n* Pakuratahi Tunnel (73m) \n* Summit Tunnel (584m) \n* Siberia Tunnel (108m) \n* Prices Tunnel (98m) \n* Wiwaka Tunnel (150m)\n\n====Current route====\nFrom Wellington to Woodville:\n* Maoribank Tunnel (572m)\n* [[Rimutaka Tunnel]] (8,798m)\n* Wiwaka Tunnel (150m)\n\n==See also==\n* [[Wairarapa Connection]]\n* [[Hutt Valley Line]]\n* [[Palmerston North - Gisborne Line]]\n* [[Te Aro Extension]]\n* [[Pahiatua Railcar Society]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book | last = Bromby | first = Robin | title = Rails that built a Nation: An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand Railways  | publisher = Grantham House | date = 2003 | location = Wellington | isbn = 1-86934-080-9  |ref=harv}} \n* {{cite book|last=Cameron|first=Walter Norman|title=A Line Of Railway: The Railway Conquest of the Rimutakas|location=Wellington|publisher=[[New Zealand Railway and Locomotive Society]]|date=1976|ISBN=0908573006|ref={{sfnref|Cameron|1974}}}}\n* {{Churchman & Hurst Railways of New Zealand}} pages 151\u2013162.\n* Leitch, David and Brian Scott ''Exploring New Zealand's Ghost Railways'' 2nd ed., Wellington: Grantham House, 1998, pp.&nbsp;39\u201343.\n* Mahoney, J.D.

The line runs for {{convert|172|km}}, connects the capital city [[Wellington]] with the [[Palmerston North - Gisborne Line]] at [[Woodville, New Zealand|Woodville]], via [[Lower Hutt]], [[Upper Hutt]] and [[Masterton]].\n\nThe first part of the line opened in 1874 between Wellington and Lower Hutt, with the entire line to Woodville completed in 1897. It was the only [[New Zealand Railways Department|New Zealand Government Railways]] route out of Wellington until 1908, when the government bought out the [[Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company]] who owned and operated the present [[North Island Main Trunk]] section between Wellington and Palmerston North. The line originally included the famous [[Rimutaka Incline]], which used the [[Fell mountain railway system]] to cross the [[Rimutaka Range]] between Upper Hutt and [[Featherston, New Zealand|Featherston]]. In the mid-1950s, the line between Petone and Featherston was substantially realigned, with the line diverted to the east of the Hutt River between Petone and Haywards to serve new housing developments in northern Lower Hutt, and the construction of the [[Rimutaka Tunnel]] to replace the Rimutaka Incline. Part of the former route west of the Hutt River has been retained as the [[Melling Branch]].\n\nThe southern portion of the line between Wellington and Upper Hutt is electrified and is also known as the [[Hutt Valley Line]]. [[Transdev]] on behalf of the [[Greater Wellington Regional Council]] runs suburban services along the Hutt Valley section, as well as the [[Wairarapa Connection]] service between Wellington and Masterton. [[KiwiRail]] runs regular freight services along the line between Wellington to Masterton and between Pahiatua and Woodville. No regular services currently run along the Masterton to Pahiatua section, and this section is currently under review as part of [[KiwiRail#Turn-around plan|KiwiRail's turnaround plan]].\n\nThe [[Sixth Labour Government of New Zealand#Transport and Infrastructure|Labour government]] promised during the 2017 election campaign to upgrade the track to improve operation of the [[Wairarapa Connection]], and on 9 October 2018 the minister [[Phil Twyford]] announced that the proposed $196 million for the region included $96 million for the Wairarapa Line; $50 million in the Wairarapa and $46.2 million south of the Rimutaka Tunnel including double-tracking the Trentham to Upper Hutt section. Work is to start in April 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/rail-upgrades-big-win-wairarapa |title= Rail upgrades a big win for the Wairarapa |publisher= The Beehive |date= 9 October 2018}}</ref> The double-tracking will be completed in 2021. Other \"infrastructure renewals\" on the line include three bridges with timber elements and track renewal (including in the Rimutaka Tunnel) but no signals renewal. Passing loops at Carterton and Woodside had previously been removed, leaving Featherston with the only loop between Upper Hutt and Masterton; the Carterton loop may need reinstating at some time for more frequent trains.<ref>''Wellington Timetable Changes and Infrastructure Upgrades'' by Bruce Taylor in ''The New Zealand Railway Observer'' June\u2013July 2018 No 349, Volume 75 No 2 pages 62,63</ref> The \"infrastructure spendup\" announced on 30 January 2020 included passing loops at Carterton, Featherston and Maymorn and a second platform at Featherston but not the proposed hybrid trains.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/wellington/119129227/new-hybrid-trains-for-wellington-snubbed-in-government-transport-package |title= New hybrid trains for Wellington snubbed in government transport package |publisher=  Stuff (Fairfax) |date= 30 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Construction==\nProposals for railed transportation out of Wellington were made as early as the start of the 1850s, barely a decade after European settlement of the area began. In 1853 and 1857, investigation of horse-hauled [[tramway (mineral)|tramways]] was undertaken, but no action was taken. [[Robert Stokes (politician)|Robert Stokes]], a member of the [[Wellington Province|provincial government]], proposed a railway over the Rimutakas in 1858 and finally succeeded in gaining government interest in 1863. The Wellington Provincial Government established a committee to investigate proposals, and on 2 July 1866 it passed the Wellington, Hutt and Wairarapa Railway Ordinance.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.nzlii.org/nz/legis/wgn_ord/whawro1866437/ |title= Wellington, Hutt and Wairarapa Railway Ordinance, 1866 |publisher= New Zealand Law online |date= 1866 }}</ref> The act authorised a railway employing either {{RailGauge|3ft6in|lk=on}} or {{RailGauge|sg|allk=on}} to carry 200 tonnes at speeds of {{convert|24|km/h}}, but construction did not commence as sufficient funds were not available in the fledgling New Zealand colony, nor were they successfully raised in [[England]].\n\nIn 1870 [[Julius Vogel]] included a Wellington-Wairarapa railway in his [[Vogel Era|Great Public Works Policy]] and visited [[London]] to arrange a loan to finance the policy. On this trip he was approached by several contracting firms and a contract that included the first section of the Wairarapa Line was awarded to [[John Brogden and Sons|Brogden & Sons]]. The construction of the line can be considered in three stages: the [[Hutt Valley]] section, the route over the Rimutakas, and the line through the Wairarapa via [[Masterton]] to [[Woodville, New Zealand|Woodville]].\n\n===Hutt Valley section===\n{{further|Hutt Valley Line}}\n\nOn 20 August 1872 construction of the Wairarapa Line began with the turning of the first sod at [[Pipitea Point]], the site of Wellington's first railway station. Construction was delayed due to the difficulties associated with building a railway along the narrow, rocky shoreline of [[Wellington Harbour]], and the section to [[Lower Hutt]] was not opened until 14 April 1874. Further difficulties were encountered in building the rest of the route up the Hutt Valley along the [[Hutt River, New Zealand|Hutt River]]'s western bank, including the need to divert the river and reinforce its bank in places. On 1 February 1876 the line opened to [[Upper Hutt]].\n\n===Rimutaka section===\n[[File:Fell Engine Museum - 2002-03-20.jpg|left|thumb|One of the special locomotives employed on the Rimutaka Incline, [[NZR H class|H 199]], now preserved at the [[Fell Engine Museum]].]]\n\n{{further|Rimutaka Incline}}\n\nThe Rimutaka Range posed a severe difficulty to those involved in planning and constructing the Wairarapa Line. On 1 January 1878 the Hutt line opened to [[Kaitoke railway station|Kaitoke]] at the western foot of the range, and a steep but manageable route with a grade of 1 in 39-40 was found from Kaitoke up the [[Pakuratahi River]] valley to the site of Summit station, {{convert|348|m}} above sea level. However, from Summit down the eastern slope to [[Cross Creek railway station|Cross Creek]] near [[Featherston railway station|Featherston]], a gradient of 1 in 14-16 was required. This was far too steep for regular [[steam locomotive]]s to handle, and accordingly the Fell mountain railway system was employed. This used a centre rail to which specially-designed locomotives and brake vans clung, allowing them to climb the steep slope upwards or control the descent. Despite the terrain, construction of this unique route was completed swiftly, opening to Featherston on 12 October 1878.\n\n===South Wairarapa section===\nConstruction from Featherston to Masterton across the Wairarapa plains north of [[Lake Wairarapa]] was relatively easy. The decision was taken to bypass [[Greytown, New Zealand|Greytown]] and build the line through [[Woodside, New Zealand|Woodside]] to bridge the [[Waiohine River]] at a point far enough up the river to be considered safe; a line through Greytown would have required a bridge at a point considered unsafe by the surveyors. The [[Greytown Branch]] was constructed from Woodside, and Greytown was briefly the effective terminus of the Wairarapa Line from the opening of the branch on 14 May 1880 until the bridging of the Waiohine a month later. Later in 1880 the line opened all the way through to Masterton.\n\n===North Wairarapa section===\nThe northern Wairarapa was more rugged and isolated, and construction was slower and more difficult. [[Mauriceville, New Zealand|Mauriceville]], {{convert|20|km}} north of Masterton, was reached on 14 June 1886, followed by the next {{convert|6|km}} to [[Mangamahoe]] on 10 January 1887. The {{convert|10|km}} between Mangamahoe and [[Eketahuna]] included the {{convert|150|m|adj=on}} long Wiwaka tunnel, the only tunnel between the Rimutaka Incline and Woodville, and the section was opened on 8 April 1889. Construction of the {{convert|4|km}} section to [[Newman, New Zealand|Newman]] was inexplicably slow, not completed until 1896. [[Pahiatua]] was reached in May 1897, including the [[Mangatainoka River]] bridge, the longest bridge on the line at {{convert|162|m}}. Mangatainoka is {{convert|24|km}} from the bridge and the railway reached it in August 1897, and the line was finally opened to Woodville and a junction with the [[Palmerston North - Gisborne Line]] on 11 December 1897.\n\n===Branch Lines===\nFour [[branch line]]s diverge from the Wairarapa Line: the [[Melling Branch]] and the [[Gracefield Branch]] to [[Hutt Workshops]], both still open; the [[Greytown Branch]], closed in 1953, and the [[Hutt Park Railway]], which ceased serving its intended purpose in 1906 but survived in truncated form as an [[Rail siding|industrial siding]] until 1982.  At one time a branch line to [[Martinborough Branch|Martinborough]] was proposed but this line never eventuated.\n\n==Deviations==\nSeveral upgrades and alterations to the Wairarapa Line have been made, but only the Western Hutt and Rimutaka tunnel deviations have significantly altered its route.\n\n===Hutt deviation===\n{{further|Hutt Valley Line|Melling Branch}}\n\nIn 1925 construction began on what was then known as the '''Hutt Valley Branch''', leaving the main line just north of [[Petone]] station and running east to [[Waterloo, New Zealand|Waterloo]], opening on 26 May 1927. After [[World War II]], new [[state housing]] suburbs developed north of Waterloo, and the railway was extended to serve them. In 1954 it re-joined the western line south of [[Manor Park, New Zealand|Manor Park]] and superseded the old route. On 1 March 1954 the former Hutt Valley Branch became part of the Wairarapa Line and the western route was truncated into the [[Melling Branch]] from Petone.\n\n===Silversteam deviation===\nThe deviation included a new bridge across the Hutt River, replacing a section of line now used by [[Silver Stream Railway]]\n\n===Rimutaka deviation===\n{{further|Rimutaka Tunnel}}\n\nThe Rimutaka Incline was difficult, costly and time-consuming to operate, but as the Wairarapa Line had become a secondary route since the acquisition of the Wellington and Manawatu Railway in 1908, its replacement was not a priority. Various alternate systems and routes were debated, with a tunnel chosen in 1936. However, the economic conditions left from the [[Great Depression]] followed by the impact of World War II meant that work on the tunnel did not start until 1948. The Incline and the line up the western side of the Rimutakas closed on 29 October 1955 and the tunnel opened on 3 November 1955.\n\n==Operation==\n\n===Passenger services===\n{{main|Wairarapa Connection}}\nWhen the full line opened in 1897, passenger services from the Hutt Valley to Wellington were augmented by NZR's first express from Wellington, the [[Napier Express]] (the WMR had operated the Wellington-[[Longburn]] portion of the [[New Plymouth Express]]). After the acquisition of the WMR, the Napier Express was re-routed to the quicker west coast route in early 1909 and the [[Wairarapa Mail]] was introduced to provide a regular service through the Wairarapa to Woodville. In 1936, [[NZR RM class|RM class]] [[NZR RM class (Wairarapa)|Wairarapa]] [[railcar]]s were introduced; these were designed to operate at speed over the Rimutaka Incline and provided a much quicker service to Wellington and local Wairarapa services. They originally augmented the Wairarapa Mail but replaced it in 1948. Carriage trains operated only at peak times of the year when the railcar capacity was exceeded; in 1955, the Incline's closure meant the Wairarapa railcars were withdrawn and [[NZR RM class (88 seater)|88 seater railcars]] were introduced, boosting capacity at off-peak times. One Wairarapa railcar has survived and is currently under restoration by the [[Pahiatua Railcar Society]]. [[Mixed train]]s also operated until the 1950s.\n\n[[File:Electric Locomotives Near Paekakariki.jpg|left|thumb|EW 1805, which operated on the Hutt Valley Line. It survived for preservation and is seen here with [[NZR DC class|DC]] 4611 near [[Paekakariki]] on the [[North Island Main Trunk Railway]].]]\n\nIn the 1950s the Hutt Valley line was electrified using the 1500 V DC system already operating to [[Johnsonville, New Zealand|Johnsonville]] and [[Paekakariki]]. The electrification was opened to [[Taita, New Zealand|Taita]] on 12 October 1953 and Upper Hutt on 24 July 1955, allowing for a more intensive suburban commuter service to Wellington. Originally operated by [[NZR DM class|DM/D class]] [[electric multiple unit]]s and carriage trains hauled by [[NZR ED class|ED]] and [[NZR EW class|EW class]] electric locomotives, the carriage trains and many of the DM/D units were phased out upon the introduction of the [[NZR EM class|\"Ganz-Mavag\" EM/ET class]] units in the early 1980s. The [[New Zealand FP class electric multiple unit|\"Matangi\" FP/FT class]] was introduced on the Hutt Valley Line in 2011\u201312, initially relegating the Ganz Mavag units to peak services only before being completely replacing them from 2015.\n\nProposals have been made to extend the electrification into the Wairarapa and the Rimutaka Tunnel was constructed to allow overhead lines to be installed, although before opening diesel operation was adopted. In 2007, the Greater Wellington Regional Council rejected a call for the line to be electrified to Masterton, stating that patronage was too low to justify the capital expenditure.<ref name=\"electric\">{{cite news |last1=Farmer |first1=Don |date={{date|July 12, 2007}} |title=Wairarapa rail won't go electric |url=http://www.times-age.co.nz/news/wairarapa-rail-wont-go-electric/980824/ |work= |location=[[Masterton]] |publisher=[[Wairarapa Times-Age]] |publication-date=12 July 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415103820/http://www.times-age.co.nz/news/wairarapa-rail-wont-go-electric/980824/ |archive-date={{date|April 15, 2012}} |access-date=21 December 2011 |ref= }}</ref>\n\nRailcar services were withdrawn in 1977, and carriage trains were re-instated progressively from early 1964. Until 1963, a railcar service operated on Friday evenings between Masterton and Woodville, and in December that year the decision was taken to replace the morning railcar to Wellington with a carriage train as over 200 passengers wished to use the railcar service that had a capacity of just 176. The final railcar service was replaced by carriage trains in December 1977; some of the carriage trains from this point until the mid-1980s were made up of de-motorised former 88-seater railcars known as \"[[NZR RM class (88 seater)#Grassgrubs|grassgrubs]]\" in [[List of NZ railfan jargon|New Zealand railfan jargon]]. Passenger services through the lowly populated northern Wairarapa survived due to the poor roads in the area, but as they were improved, demand for the trains declined. Masterton \u2013 Palmerston North passenger trains ceased from Monday, 1 August 1988{{sfn|Bromby|2003|p=40|ps=&nbsp;\"Passenger services on the 80.5 km Masterton\u2013Woodville section ended from 1 August 1988\"}} with the last such service running on Friday, 29 July.{{sfn|Churchman & Hurst|2001|p=160}} In the 1990s, the service between Masterton and Wellington was rebranded as the [[Wairarapa Connection]] and presently operates five times each way weekdays (with a sixth service in the evening on Fridays), and twice each way on weekends and public holidays. In 2007, eighteen new [[New Zealand British Rail Mark 2 carriage|SW class]] carriages were introduced to replace the [[NZR 56-foot carriage|56ft carriages]] used since the service's inception; in 2013, they were joined by the six SE class to relieve capacity constraints especially on evening services.\n\nThe 2020-2021 ($300 million) Wellington Metro Rail Upgrade work started in November 2019 and is expected to take eighteen months. The single-track Trentham-Upper Hutt section is to be double-tracked, and will be equipped for bi-directional signalling so that trains can run on either track in either direction between Upper Hutt and Trentham (and possibly later to Heretaunga). The work is expected to improve the operation of both suburban passenger trains to Upper Hutt and the [[Wairarapa Connection]], with a longer loop at Upper Hutt to hold Wairarapa log trains.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Wellington Rail Upgrades|journal=The New Zealand Railway Observer|date=February\u2013March 2020|number=359|p=251\u2013252|volume=76| issue = 6}}</ref>\n\n===Freight services===\nUntil the acquisition of the WMR in December 1908 all NZR freight out of Wellington was carried on the Wairarapa Line. As soon as the western route became available, all freight that could be diverted off the Wairarapa Line was diverted, due to the difficulties created by the Rimutaka Incline. This meant that even some traffic from the northern Wairarapa was sent through the [[Manawatu Gorge]] and down the west coast to Wellington. The opening of the Rimutaka Tunnel made the line more desirable for through freight traffic, but as localised freight gave way to containerised inter-city freight in the 1980s, the significance of the Wairarapa Line declined, especially on the section north of Masterton.\n\nKiwiRail is currently investigating a log shipment hub in Masterton that would mean log traffic would use the northern portion of the Wairarapa Line, from Masterton to Napier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/5442814/KiwiRail-in-talks-to-revive-Wairarapa-rail-line|title=KiwiRail in talks to revive Wairarapa rail line|date=15 August 2011|accessdate=15 August 2011|author=Matt Stewart|publisher=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]]}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2012 it was reported that the total freight carried on the northern section of the line had increased from 74,031 tonnes in 2009 to 97,139 tonnes in 2011, although this figure was inflated by a ten-day closure of the Manawatu Gorge section of the railway line due to a slip.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/manawatu-standard/news/6374796/Pahiatua-rail-link-looking-up|title=Pahiatua rail link looking up|publisher=[[Manawatu Standard]]|date=8 February 2012|accessdate=8 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nPresently freight services operate at each end of the line. Log and other wood-related traffic is moved between Wellington and [[Waingawa railway station|Waingawa]], just south of Masterton, with one overnight and one daylight return service on weekdays, and a daylight service operates both weekend days. Two freight trains operate from Palmerston North to Pahiatua and return on weekdays, the first in the early hours of the morning and the second in the afternoon. No freights currently operate regularly at weekends.\n\nKiwiRail ceased running timetabled revenue services on the Masterton\u2013Pahiatua section of the line in February 2015, transferring the Sunday Wellington to Palmerston North via Woodville run to the NIMT.  However, they have undertaken to keep it open and maintain it to an operational standard, in part because it is still in use by heritage operators,<ref name=\"Line to Pahiatua stays open\">{{cite news |last1=Yong |first1=Alisa |date=3 June 2015 |title=Line to Pahiatua stays open |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/wairarapa-times-age/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503414&objectid=11458882 |department= |newspaper=Wairarapa Times-Age |location=Masterton |publisher=NZME.

They were augmented by members of the [[NZR M class|M]] and [[NZR N class|N]] classes. In the twentieth century, typical locomotives included members of the [[NZR A class (1906)|A]] and [[NZR Ab class|A<sup>B</sup>]] class. The Rimutaka Incline was almost always operated by the six members of the [[NZR H class|H class]] built specifically for it. In 1906 [[NZR E class (1906)|E 66]] was built for the Incline but did not prove as successful as the six H locomotives and was retired in 1917.\n\nWhen the Rimutaka Tunnel opened in November 1955, the Wairarapa Line became the first in New Zealand to be fully [[dieselisation|dieselised]] as steam locomotives were unable to pass through the tunnel. Initially, [[NZR DE class|DE]] and [[New Zealand DG and DH class locomotive|DG]] class diesels were employed, and they were soon joined by the [[New Zealand DA class locomotive|DA class]]. Until 1967, the Wairarapa Line was the only way DA class locomotives could access Wellington due to tunnels south of Paekakariki being too small. In the 1980s, the DG class had been fully withdrawn and the DA class in the process of withdrawal or conversion to the [[NZR DC class|DC class]]; accordingly motive power on the Wairarapa Line changed. Until 2015, the DC class was the mainstay of the Wairarapa line south of Masterton, with locomotives of the [[NZR DBR class|DBR]], [[New Zealand DF class locomotive (1979)|DF/DFT]] and [[New Zealand DX class locomotive|DX]] classes occasionally used. In July 2015, the DFT class took over services on the line.<ref>{{cite news |first= Emily |last= Norman |date= 2 July 2015 |title= Faster locos mean timely rides - council |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/wairarapa-times-age/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503414&objectid=11474493 |publisher= [[Wairarapa Times-Age]] |accessdate= 24 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nAs of May 2016, rolling stock regularly used on the Wairarapa Line include:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#f9f9f9;\"\n!

Signalling at Petone is future-proofed for conversion to a fifth system, Automatic Signalling Rules (ASR).\n\nThe Wairarapa Line had a number of lasts for railway signalling in New Zealand\n* [[Railway semaphore signal|Semaphore Signal]] on an operational line, these were decommissioned in 1996 however the masts (poles) remained in place until July 2014.\n* Line controlled by ''[[Tyers Electric Train Tablet]]''\n* Manned signal box outside of a major station\n\nPrior to the Trentham\u2013Upper Hutt\u2013Featherston section being transferred to Train Control in February 2007, this was the last section with CTC controlled by a [[signalman (rail)|signalman]]. Part-time signal boxes remained at Petone (weekday peak and inter-peak) and at Taita (weekday peak) until December 2013 and July 2014 respectively, when signalling was switched to Train Control in central Wellington.\n\nMasterton is a unique signalling arrangement with Track Warrant Control ending at 'TWC Ends' boards north of the two-position home signal, which allows shunting movements to be carried out without the need for a Track Warrant. Along with [[Horotiu railway station|Horotiu]] (on the NIMT between Te Rapa and Ng\u0101ruaw\u0101hia) Masterton still has Woods Points Keys. The Horotiu ones are not in regular use.\n\n==Heritage==\n[[File:Carterton Railway Station 02.jpg|left|thumb|[[Carterton railway station]], base of the Wairarapa Railway Restoration Society Inc.]]\n\nSeven [[Railway preservation in New Zealand|railway preservation]] organisations are based on or close by the Wairarapa Line.\n\n===New Zealand Railway and Locomotive Society===\n{{Main|New Zealand Railway and Locomotive Society}}\nNZRLS has a workshop based at the northern end of the [[Silver Stream Railway]] where members restoring two [[Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company]] carriages.

The sidings remain at Taratahi but the main line points were removed around 2003 (Ravensdown Fertiliser). Lime Works at Mauriceville are also still connected to the network but are overgrown and covered with lime.  The former siding at Eurocell (Parapine) in Upper Hutt closed in 2012.<ref>{{cite news |last1=WILLIAMS |first1=COLIN |date=1 February 2012 |title=Eurocell site sold off |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/local-papers/upper-hutt-leader/6345145/Eurocell-site-sold-off |format= |department= |newspaper=Upper Hutt Leader |type= |location=Upper Hutt |publisher=Fairfax New Zealand |publication-date= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate=27 June 2014 |ref= }}</ref>\n\nExtensive sidings at Petone, Naenae (where the goods shed remains, in non-rail use), Taita (Unilever) and Trentham (Army) have been closed and removed. Other former sidings include one used by oil companies between Renall St and Masterton stations; disused sidings at Mauriceville and Eketahuna; the Ngauranga Industrial Siding to an abattoir in the Ngauranga Gorge; and a siding to the [[Featherston Military Camp]] north of Featherston during World War I.\n\n===Tunnels===\nNine tunnels have been constructed on the various routes of the Wairarapa Line. Of these, only three are now in use for railway purposes, and only the Wiwaka tunnel in northern Wairarapa (150m; between Mangamahoe & Eketahuna) has remained unaffected by deviations since the line opened.\n\nFive of these tunnels are now part of the Rimutaka Rail Trail: Mangaroa, Pakuratahi, Summit, Siberia and Prices. The Rimutaka Incline Railway project hopes to incorporate these tunnels into its restored railway line across the Rimutaka Ranges.\n\n====Original route====\nFrom Wellington to Woodville:\n* Cruickshanks Tunnel (120m) \n* Mangaroa Tunnel (152m)\n* Pakuratahi Tunnel (73m) \n* Summit Tunnel (584m) \n* Siberia Tunnel (108m) \n* Prices Tunnel (98m) \n* Wiwaka Tunnel (150m)\n\n====Current route====\nFrom Wellington to Woodville:\n* Maoribank Tunnel (572m)\n* [[Rimutaka Tunnel]] (8,798m)\n* Wiwaka Tunnel (150m)\n\n==See also==\n* [[Wairarapa Connection]]\n* [[Hutt Valley Line]]\n* [[Palmerston North - Gisborne Line]]\n* [[Te Aro Extension]]\n* [[Pahiatua Railcar Society]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book | last = Bromby | first = Robin | title = Rails that built a Nation: An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand Railways  | publisher = Grantham House | date = 2003 | location = Wellington | isbn = 1-86934-080-9  |ref=harv}} \n* {{cite book|last=Cameron|first=Walter Norman|title=A Line Of Railway: The Railway Conquest of the Rimutakas|location=Wellington|publisher=[[New Zealand Railway and Locomotive Society]]|date=1976|ISBN=0908573006|ref={{sfnref|Cameron|1974}}}}\n* {{Churchman & Hurst Railways of New Zealand}} pages 151\u2013162.\n* Leitch, David and Brian Scott ''Exploring New Zealand's Ghost Railways'' 2nd ed., Wellington: Grantham House, 1998, pp.&nbsp;39\u201343.\n* Mahoney, J.D.
