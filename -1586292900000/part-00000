The more commonly used name, \"San Siro\", is the name of the district where it is located. San Siro has been the home of Milan since 1926, when it was privately built by funding from Milan's president at the time, {{interlanguage link|Piero Pirelli|it}}. Construction was performed by 120 workers, and took 13-and-a-half months to complete. The stadium was owned by the club until it was sold to the city in 1935, and since 1947, it has been shared with Internazionale when the other major Milanese club was accepted as joint tenant.\n\nThe first game played at the stadium was on 19 September 1926, when Milan lost 6\u20133 in a friendly match against Internazionale. Milan played its first league game in San Siro on 19 September 1926, losing 1\u20132 to [[Sampierdarenese]]. From an initial capacity of 35,000 spectators, the stadium has undergone several major renovations, most recently in preparation for the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] when its capacity was set to 85,700, all covered with a polycarbonate roof. In the summer of 2008 its capacity has been reduced to 80,018, to meet the new standards set by [[UEFA]].\n\nBased on the English model for stadiums, San Siro is specifically designed for football matches, as opposed to many multi-purpose stadiums used in Serie A. It is therefore renowned in Italy for its fantastic atmosphere during matches, largely thanks to the closeness of the stands to the pitch. The frequent use of [[flare (pyrotechnic)|flares]] by supporters contributes to the atmosphere but the practice has occasionally caused problems.\n\nOn 19 December 2005, Milan vice-president and executive director [[Adriano Galliani]] announced that the club was seriously working towards a relocation. He stated Milan's new stadium will be largely based on the [[Veltins-Arena]]&nbsp;\u2013 the home of [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]] in [[Gelsenkirchen]]&nbsp;\u2013 and will follow the standards of football stadiums in the United States, Germany and Spain. As opposed to many other stadiums in Italy, Milan's new stadium would likely be used for football only, having no athletics track. On 11 December 2014, Barbara Berlusconi announced a proposal to build a property stadium of 42,000 seats in [[Portello (district of Milan)|Portello]], behind the new HQ of the Rossoneri, and the large square \"Piazza Gino Valle\".

Its heaviest defeat was recorded in the league at the 1922\u201323 season, beaten 0\u20138 by [[Bologna F.C. 1909|Bologna]].\n\nDuring the [[1991\u201392 Serie A|1991\u201392 season]], the club achieved the feature of being the first team to win the Serie A title without losing a single game. Previously, only [[A.C. Perugia Calcio|Perugia]] had managed to go unbeaten over an entire Serie A season ([[1978\u201379 Serie A|1978\u201379]]), but finished second in the table. In total, Milan's unbeaten streak lasted 58 games, starting with a 0\u20130 draw against [[S.S.D. Parma Calcio 1913|Parma]] on 26 May 1991 and coincidentally ending with a 1\u20130 home loss to Parma on 21 March 1993. This is a Serie A record as well as the third-longest unbeaten run in top flight European football, coming in behind [[FC Steaua Bucure\u0219ti|Steaua Bucure\u0219ti]]'s record of 104 unbeaten games and [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]]'s 68 game unbeaten run.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.fortunecity.com/olympia/wagner/321/historiami.htm |publisher=Milanista Olympia |title=Milano History and Records |date=25 July 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060331022952/http://www.fortunecity.com/olympia/wagner/321/historiami.htm |archivedate=31 March 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Piers|last=Edwards|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/africa/4391088.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|title=Unbeaten half-century for Ahly|date=25 July 2007|accessdate=13 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nSince 2007, along with [[Boca Juniors]], Milan has won more [[FIFA]] recognised international club titles than any other club in the world with 18 titles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/sport/football_italia/dec16g.html |title=Milan top of the world! |work=Channel4.com |accessdate=17 December 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218143838/http://www.channel4.com/sport/football_italia/dec16g.html |archivedate=18 December 2007 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref>  They were overtaken by [[Al Ahly SC]] from [[Egypt]] after their [[2014 CAF Confederation Cup]] win.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cafonline.com/en-US/NewsCenter/News/NewsDetails?id=h9L1o1Jb8%2bvxmR2cfmXA3A%3d%3d|title=Meteb's injury-time goal gives Ahly final triumph|publisher=CAF|date=6 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe sale of [[Kak\u00e1]] to Real Madrid in 2009 broke the eight-year-old [[world football transfer record]] held by [[Zinedine Zidane]], costing the Spanish club \u20ac67 million<ref name=Milan2009bilancio/> (about \u00a356 million<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inquisitr.com/25559/kaka-transfers-to-real-madrid-in-world-record-dbp/ |title=Kaka joins Real Madrid in world record $89&nbsp;million transfer |publisher=Inquisitr.com |date=9 June 2009|accessdate=12 December 2010}}</ref>).

The more commonly used name, \"San Siro\", is the name of the district where it is located. San Siro has been the home of Milan since 1926, when it was privately built by funding from Milan's president at the time, {{interlanguage link|Piero Pirelli|it}}. Construction was performed by 120 workers, and took 13-and-a-half months to complete. The stadium was owned by the club until it was sold to the city in 1935, and since 1947, it has been shared with Internazionale when the other major Milanese club was accepted as joint tenant.\n\nThe first game played at the stadium was on 19 September 1926, when Milan lost 6\u20133 in a friendly match against Internazionale. Milan played its first league game in San Siro on 19 September 1926, losing 1\u20132 to [[Sampierdarenese]]. From an initial capacity of 35,000 spectators, the stadium has undergone several major renovations, most recently in preparation for the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] when its capacity was set to 85,700, all covered with a polycarbonate roof. In the summer of 2008 its capacity has been reduced to 80,018, to meet the new standards set by [[UEFA]].\n\nBased on the English model for stadiums, San Siro is specifically designed for football matches, as opposed to many multi-purpose stadiums used in Serie A. It is therefore renowned in Italy for its fantastic atmosphere during matches, largely thanks to the closeness of the stands to the pitch. The frequent use of [[flare (pyrotechnic)|flares]] by supporters contributes to the atmosphere but the practice has occasionally caused problems.\n\nOn 19 December 2005, Milan vice-president and executive director [[Adriano Galliani]] announced that the club was seriously working towards a relocation. He stated Milan's new stadium will be largely based on the [[Veltins-Arena]]&nbsp;\u2013 the home of [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]] in [[Gelsenkirchen]]&nbsp;\u2013 and will follow the standards of football stadiums in the United States, Germany and Spain. As opposed to many other stadiums in Italy, Milan's new stadium would likely be used for football only, having no athletics track. On 11 December 2014, Barbara Berlusconi announced a proposal to build a property stadium of 42,000 seats in [[Portello (district of Milan)|Portello]], behind the new HQ of the Rossoneri, and the large square \"Piazza Gino Valle\".

Rivera is also Milan's youngest ever goalscorer, scoring in a league match against Juventus at just 17 years.\n\nLegendary tactician [[Nereo Rocco]], the first proponent of ''[[catenaccio]]'' in the country, was Milan's longest-serving manager, sitting on the bench for over nine years (in two spells) in the 1960s and early 1970s, winning the club's first European Cup triumphs. Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who purchased the club in 1986, is Milan's longest-serving president (23 years, due to a two-year vacancy between 2004 and 2006).\n\nThe first official match in which Milan participated was in the [[1900 Italian Football Championship|Third Federal Football Championship]], the predecessor of Serie A, losing 3\u20130 to [[F.B.C.

Previously, only [[A.C. Perugia Calcio|Perugia]] had managed to go unbeaten over an entire Serie A season ([[1978\u201379 Serie A|1978\u201379]]), but finished second in the table. In total, Milan's unbeaten streak lasted 58 games, starting with a 0\u20130 draw against [[S.S.D. Parma Calcio 1913|Parma]] on 26 May 1991 and coincidentally ending with a 1\u20130 home loss to Parma on 21 March 1993.
