He wrote at a time of religious flux and political upheaval, and is best known for his [[epic poetry|epic poem]] ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (1667), written in [[blank verse]], and widely considered to be one of the greatest works of literature ever written.\n\nWriting in English, Latin, Greek, and Italian, he achieved international renown within his lifetime; his celebrated ''[[Areopagitica]]'' (1644), written in condemnation of [[Prior restraint|pre-publication censorship]], is among history's most influential and impassioned defences of [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of the press]]. His desire for freedom extended into his style: he introduced new words (coined from Latin) to the English language, and was the first modern writer to employ unrhymed verse outside of the theatre or translations.\n\n[[William Hayley]]'s 1796 biography called him the \"greatest English author\",<ref>McCalman 2001 p. 605.</ref> and he remains generally regarded \"as one of the preeminent writers in the English language\",<ref>''Contemporary Literary Criticism''. [http://www.enotes.com/literary-criticism/milton-john \"Milton, John \u2013 Introduction\"].</ref> though critical reception has oscillated in the centuries since his death (often on account of his [[republicanism]]). [[Samuel Johnson]] praised ''Paradise Lost'' as \"a poem which...with respect to design may claim the first place, and with respect to performance, the second, among the productions of the human mind\", though he (a [[Tory]] and recipient of royal patronage) described Milton's politics as those of an \"acrimonious and surly republican\".<ref name=Works>{{cite book|last=Murphy|first=Arthur|title=The Works of Samuel Johnson, LL.

Milton studied, travelled, wrote poetry mostly for private circulation, and launched a career as pamphleteer and publicist under the increasingly personal rule of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and its breakdown into constitutional confusion and war. The shift in accepted attitudes in government placed him in public office under the [[Commonwealth of England]], from being thought dangerously radical and even heretical, and he even acted as an official spokesman in certain of his publications. The [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of 1660 deprived Milton, now completely blind, of his public platform, but this period saw him complete most of his major works of poetry.\n\nMilton's views developed from his very extensive reading, as well as travel and experience, from his student days of the 1620s to the [[English Civil War]].<ref>Masson 1859 pp. v\u2013vi.</ref> By the time of his death in 1674, Milton was impoverished and on the margins of English intellectual life, yet famous throughout Europe and unrepentant for his political choices.\n\n===Early life===\n{{Main|Early life of John Milton}}\n[[File:John Milton plaque Bread Street London.jpg|thumb|left|Blue plaque in Bread Street, London, where Milton was born]]\n\nJohn Milton was born in Bread Street, London on 9 December 1608, the son of composer [[John Milton (composer)|John Milton]] and his wife Sarah Jeffrey. The senior John Milton (1562\u20131647) moved to London around 1583 after being disinherited by his devout Catholic father Richard \"the Ranger\" Milton for embracing Protestantism.<ref name=\":3\" /> In London, the senior John Milton married Sarah Jeffrey (1572\u20131637) and found lasting financial success as a [[scrivener]].<ref name=Forsyth16>{{cite book |last=Forsyth |first=Neil |title=John Milton A Biography |edition=1st |year=2008 |publisher=[[Lion Hudson]] |location=Wilkinson House, Jordan Hill Road, Oxford OX2 8DR, England |isbn=978-0-7459-5310-6 |page=[https://archive.org/details/johnmiltonbiogra0000fors/page/16 16] |chapter=St. Paul's |url=https://archive.org/details/johnmiltonbiogra0000fors/page/16 }}</ref> He lived in and worked from a house on [[Bread Street]], where the [[Mermaid Tavern]] was located in [[Cheapside]]. The elder Milton was noted for his skill as a musical composer, and this talent left his son with a lifelong appreciation for music and friendships with musicians such as [[Henry Lawes]].<ref>Lewalski 2003 p. 3.</ref>\n\nMilton's father's prosperity provided his eldest son with a private tutor, [[Thomas Young (1587\u20131655)|Thomas Young]], a Scottish Presbyterian with an M.A. from the University of St. Andrews. Research suggests that Young's influence served as the poet's introduction to religious radicalism.<ref>Skerpan-Wheeler, Elizabeth. \"John Milton.\" British Rhetoricians and Logicians, 1500\u20131660: Second Series. Ed. Edward A. Malone. Detroit: Gale, 2003. Dictionary of Literary Biography Vol. 281. Literature Resource Center.</ref> After Young's tutorship, Milton attended [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's School]] in London. There he began the study of Latin and Greek, and the classical languages left an imprint on both his poetry and prose in English (he also wrote in Italian and Latin).\n\n[[File:John Milton portrait.jpg|thumb|John Milton at age 10 by [[Cornelis Janssens van Ceulen]]. In [[Milton's Cottage]], [[Chalfont St Giles]].]]\n\nMilton's first datable compositions are two psalms done at age 15 at [[Long Bennington]]. One contemporary source is the ''[[Brief Lives]]'' of [[John Aubrey]], an uneven compilation including first-hand reports. In the work, Aubrey quotes Christopher, Milton's younger brother: \"When he was young, he studied very hard and sat up very late, commonly till twelve or one o'clock at night\". Aubrey adds, \"\"His complexion exceeding faire\u2014he was so faire that they called him the Lady of Christ's College.\"<ref name=OLD>Dick 1962 pp. 270\u201375.</ref>\n\nIn 1625, Milton began attending [[Christ's College, Cambridge]]. He graduated with a B.A. in 1629,<ref>{{acad|id=MLTN624J|name=Milton, John}}</ref> ranking fourth of 24&nbsp;honours graduates that year in the University of Cambridge.<ref>Hunter 1980 p. 99.</ref> Preparing to become an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] priest, Milton stayed on and obtained his [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|Master of Arts degree]] on 3 July 1632.\n\nMilton may have been [[rustication (academia)|rusticated]] (suspended) in his first year for quarrelling with his tutor, Bishop [[William Chappell (bishop)|William Chappell]]. He was certainly at home in London in the Lent Term 1626; there he wrote his ''Elegia Prima'', a first Latin [[elegy]], to Charles Diodati, a friend from St Paul's. Based on remarks of [[John Aubrey]], Chappell \"whipt\" Milton.<ref name=OLD/> This story is now disputed, though certainly Milton disliked Chappell.<ref>Wedgwood 1961 p. 178.</ref> Historian [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]] cautiously notes that Milton was \"apparently\" rusticated, and that the differences between Chappell and Milton may have been either religious or personal.<ref>Hill 1977 p. 34.</ref> It is also possible that, like [[Isaac Newton]] four decades later, Milton was sent home because of the [[Plague (disease)|plague]], by which Cambridge was badly affected in 1625. In 1626, Milton's tutor was Nathaniel Tovey.\n\nAt Cambridge, Milton was on good terms with [[Edward King (British poet)|Edward King]], for whom he later wrote \"[[Lycidas]]\". He also befriended Anglo-American dissident and theologian [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]]. Milton tutored Williams in Hebrew in exchange for lessons in Dutch.<ref>Pfeiffer 1955 pp. 363\u201373.</ref> Despite developing a reputation for poetic skill and general erudition, Milton experienced alienation from his peers and university life as a whole. Having once watched his fellow students attempting comedy upon the college stage, he later observed 'they thought themselves gallant men, and I thought them fools'.<ref>Milton 1959 pp. 887\u201388.</ref>\n\nMilton was disdainful of the university curriculum, which consisted of stilted formal debates conducted in Latin on abstruse topics. His own corpus is not devoid of humour, notably his sixth [[wikt:prolusion|prolusion]] and his epitaphs on the death of [[Thomas Hobson]]. While at Cambridge, he wrote a number of his well-known shorter English poems, among them \"On the Morning of Christ's Nativity\", his \"Epitaph on the admirable Dramaticke Poet, W. Shakespeare\" (his first poem to appear in print), ''[[L'Allegro]]'', and ''[[Il Penseroso]]''.\n\n===Study, poetry, and travel===\n{{Details|Early life of John Milton}}\n{{quote box\n|width=40%\n|quote=It appears in all his writings that he had the usual concomitant of great abilities, a lofty and steady confidence in himself, perhaps not without some contempt of others; for scarcely any man ever wrote so much, and praised so few. Of his praise he was very frugal; as he set its value high, and considered his mention of a name as a security against the waste of time, and a certain preservative from oblivion.<ref>Johnson 1826 Vol. I. p. 64.</ref>\n|source=\u2013 [[Samuel Johnson]], ''[[Lives of the Most Eminent English Poets]]''\n}}\n\nUpon receiving his M.A. in 1632, Milton retired to [[Hammersmith]], his father's new home since the previous year. He also lived at [[Horton, Berkshire|Horton]], Berkshire, from 1635 and undertook six years of self-directed private study. Hill argues that this was not retreat into a rural idyll; Hammersmith was then a \"suburban village\" falling into the orbit of London, and even Horton was becoming deforested and suffered from the plague.<ref>Hill 1977 p. 38.</ref> He read both ancient and modern works of theology, philosophy, history, politics, literature, and science in preparation for a prospective poetical career. Milton's intellectual development can be charted via entries in his [[commonplace book]] (like a scrapbook), now in the [[British Library]]. As a result of such intensive study, Milton is considered to be among the most learned of all English poets. In addition to his years of private study, Milton had command of Latin, Greek, Hebrew, French, Spanish, and Italian from his school and undergraduate days; he also added Old English to his linguistic repertoire in the 1650s while researching his ''History of Britain'', and probably acquired proficiency in Dutch soon after.<ref>Lewalski 2003 p. 103.</ref>\n\n[[File:John Milton plaque Berkyn Manor Farm Horton.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Commemorative blue plaque 'John Milton lived here 1632\u20131638' at Berkyn Manor Farm, [[Horton, Berkshire]]]]\n\nMilton continued to write poetry during this period of study; his ''[[Arcades (Milton)|Arcades]]'' and ''[[Comus (John Milton)|Comus]]'' were both commissioned for [[masques]] composed for noble patrons, connections of the Egerton family, and performed in 1632 and 1634 respectively. ''Comus'' argues for the virtuousness of [[temperance (virtue)|temperance]] and [[chastity]].  He contributed his [[pastoral]] [[elegy]] ''[[Lycidas]]'' to a memorial collection for one of his fellow-students at Cambridge.  Drafts of these poems are preserved in Milton's poetry notebook, known as the Trinity Manuscript because it is now kept at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], Cambridge.\n\nIn May 1638, Milton embarked upon a tour of France and Italy that lasted until July or August 1639.<ref>Chaney 1985 and 2000.</ref> His travels supplemented his study with new and direct experience of artistic and religious traditions, especially Roman Catholicism. He met famous theorists and intellectuals of the time, and was able to display his poetic skills. For specific details of what happened within Milton's \"[[grand tour]]\", there appears to be just one [[primary source]]: Milton's own ''[[Defensio Secunda]]''. There are other records, including some letters and some references in his other prose tracts, but the bulk of the information about the tour comes from a work that, according to [[Barbara Lewalski]], \"was not intended as autobiography but as rhetoric, designed to emphasise his sterling reputation with the learned of Europe.\"<ref>Lewalski 2003 pp. 87\u201388.</ref>\n\nHe first went to [[Calais]] and then on to Paris, riding horseback, with a letter from diplomat [[Henry Wotton]] to ambassador [[John Scudamore (ambassador)|John Scudamore]]. Through Scudamore, Milton met [[Hugo Grotius]], a Dutch law philosopher, playwright, and poet. Milton left France soon after this meeting. He travelled south from [[Nice, France|Nice]] to [[Genoa]], and then to [[Livorno]] and [[Pisa]]. He reached Florence in July 1638. While there, Milton enjoyed many of the sites and structures of the city. His candour of manner and erudite neo-Latin poetry earned him friends in Florentine intellectual circles, and he met the astronomer [[Galileo]] who was under [[house arrest]] at [[Arcetri]], as well as others.<ref>Lewalski 2003 pp. 88\u201394.</ref> Milton probably visited the Florentine Academy and the [[Accademia della Crusca]] along with smaller academies in the area, including the Apatisti and the [[Svogliati]].\n\n{{quote box |width=40% |quote=In [Florence], which I have always admired above all others because of the elegance, not just of its tongue, but also of its wit, I lingered for about two months. There I at once became the friend of many gentlemen eminent in rank and learning, whose private academies I frequented\u2014a Florentine institution which deserves great praise not only for promoting humane studies but also for encouraging friendly intercourse.<ref>Milton 1959 Vol. IV part I. pp. 615\u201317.</ref> |source=\u2013 Milton's account of Florence in ''Defensio Secunda''}}\n\nHe left Florence in September to continue to Rome. With the connections from Florence, Milton was able to have easy access to Rome's intellectual society. His poetic abilities impressed those like Giovanni Salzilli, who praised Milton within an epigram. In late October, Milton attended a dinner given by the [[English College, Rome]], despite his dislike for the [[Society of Jesus]], meeting English Catholics who were also guests\u2014theologian [[Henry Holden]] and the poet [[Patrick Cary]].<ref>Chaney 1985 and 2000 and Lewalski p. 96.</ref> He also attended musical events, including oratorios, operas, and melodramas. Milton left for [[Naples]] toward the end of November, where he stayed only for a month because of the Spanish control.<ref>Chaney 1985 p. 244\u201351 and Chaney 2000 p. 313.</ref> During that time, he was introduced to Giovanni Battista Manso, patron to both [[Torquato Tasso]] and to [[Giambattista Marino]].<ref>Lewalski 2003 pp. 94\u201398.</ref>\n\nOriginally, Milton wanted to leave Naples in order to travel to [[Sicily]] and then on to Greece, but he returned to England during the summer of 1639 because of what he claimed in ''Defensio Secunda''<ref>Lewalski 2003 p. 98.</ref> were \"sad tidings of civil war in England.\"<ref>Milton 1959 Vol. IV part I pp. 618\u201319.</ref> Matters became more complicated when Milton received word that his childhood friend Diodati had died. Milton in fact stayed another seven months on the continent, and spent time at [[Geneva]] with Diodati's uncle after he returned to Rome. In ''Defensio Secunda'', Milton proclaimed that he was warned against a return to Rome because of his frankness about religion, but he stayed in the city for two months and was able to experience [[Carnival]] and meet [[Lukas Holste]], a Vatican librarian who guided Milton through its collection. He was introduced to Cardinal [[Francesco Barberini (1597\u20131679)|Francesco Barberini]] who invited Milton to an opera hosted by the Cardinal. Around March, Milton travelled once again to Florence, staying there for two months, attending further meetings of the academies, and spending time with friends. After leaving Florence, he travelled through Lucca, Bologna, and Ferrara before coming to [[Venice]]. In Venice, Milton was exposed to a model of Republicanism, later important in his political writings, but he soon found another model when he travelled to Geneva. From Switzerland, Milton travelled to Paris and then to Calais before finally arriving back in England in either July or August 1639.<ref>Lewalski 2003 pp. 99\u2013109.</ref>\n\n===Civil war, prose tracts, and marriage===\n{{Main|Milton's antiprelatical tracts}}\n[[File:Areopagitica bridwell.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Title page of the 1644 edition of ''[[Areopagitica]]'']]\n\nOn returning to England where the [[Bishops' Wars]] presaged further armed conflict, Milton began to write prose [[tract (literature)|tracts]] against [[episcopacy]], in the service of the [[Puritan]] and [[Long Parliament|Parliamentary]] cause. Milton's first foray into polemics was ''Of Reformation touching Church Discipline in England'' (1641), followed by ''Of Prelatical Episcopacy'', the two defences of [[Smectymnuus]] (a group of Presbyterian divines named from their initials; the \"TY\" belonged to Milton's old tutor Thomas Young), and ''[[The Reason of Church-Government Urged against Prelaty]]''. He vigorously attacked the High-church party of the Church of England and their leader [[William Laud]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], with frequent passages of real eloquence lighting up the rough controversial style of the period, and deploying a wide knowledge of church history.\n\nHe was supported by his father's investments, but Milton became a private schoolmaster at this time, educating his nephews and other children of the well-to-do. This experience and discussions with educational reformer [[Samuel Hartlib]] led him to write his short tract ''[[Of Education]]'' in 1644, urging a reform of the national universities.\n\nIn June 1642, Milton paid a visit to the manor house at [[Forest Hill, Oxfordshire]], and returned with 16-year-old bride Mary Powell.<ref name=\"ODNB Milton\">{{cite journal|first=Gordon|last=Campbell|title=Milton, John (1608\u20131674)|journal=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|volume=1|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|edition=Online|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/18800|accessdate=25 October 2013|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/18800}} {{ODNBsub}}</ref><ref>Lobel 1957 pp. 122\u201334.</ref> Mary found life difficult with the severe 35-year-old schoolmaster and pamphleteer, and she returned to her family a month later. She did not return until 1645, partly because of the outbreak of the [[First English Civil War|Civil War]].<ref name=\"ODNB Milton\"/>\n\nIn the meantime, her desertion prompted Milton to publish [[Milton's divorce tracts|a series of pamphlets]] over the next three years arguing for the legality and morality of divorce. ([[Anna Beer]], one of Milton's most recent biographers, points to a lack of evidence and the dangers of cynicism in urging that it was not necessarily the case that the private life so animated the public polemicising.) In 1643, Milton had a brush with the authorities over these writings, in parallel with [[Hezekiah Woodward]], who had more trouble.<ref>Lewalski 2003 pp. 181\u201382, 600.</ref> It was the hostile response accorded the divorce tracts that spurred Milton to write ''[[Areopagitica|Areopagitica; A speech of Mr. John Milton for the Liberty of Unlicenc'd Printing, to the Parlament of England]]'', his celebrated attack on pre-printing censorship.  In ''Areopagitica'', Milton aligns himself with the parliamentary cause, and he also begins to synthesize the ideal of neo-Roman liberty with that of Christian liberty.<ref>Ann Hughes, 'Milton, Areopagitica, and the Parliamentary Cause', ''The Oxford Handbook of Milton'', ed.

Nicholas McDowell and Nigel Smith, Oxford University Press, 2009</ref>\n\n===Secretary for Foreign Tongues===\nWith the parliamentary victory in the Civil War, Milton used his pen in defence of the republican principles represented by the Commonwealth. ''[[The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates]]'' (1649) defended the right of the people to hold their rulers to account, and implicitly sanctioned the [[regicide]]; Milton's political reputation got him appointed Secretary for Foreign Tongues by the Council of State in March 1649. His main job description was to compose the English Republic's foreign correspondence in Latin, but he also was called upon to produce propaganda for the regime and to serve as a censor.<ref>C. Sullivan, 'Milton and the Beginning of Civil Service', in ''Literature in the Public Service'' (2013), Ch. 2.</ref>\n\n[[File:19 York Street, Westminster (1848).jpg|thumb|The back of no 19 York Street (1848).

Milton tried to break this powerful image of Charles I (the literal translation of Eikonoklastes is 'the image breaker'). A month later, however, the exiled [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and his party published the defence of monarchy ''Defensio Regia pro Carolo Primo'', written by leading humanist [[Claudius Salmasius]]. By January of the following year, Milton was ordered to write a defence of the English people by the [[English Council of State|Council of State]]. Milton worked more slowly than usual, given the European audience and the English Republic's desire to establish diplomatic and cultural legitimacy, as he drew on the learning marshalled by his years of study to compose a riposte.\n\nOn 24 February 1652, Milton published his Latin defence of the English people ''[[Defensio pro Populo Anglicano]]'', also known as the ''First Defence''. Milton's pure Latin prose and evident learning exemplified in the ''First Defence'' quickly made him a European reputation, and the work ran to numerous editions.<ref>von Maltzahn 1999 p. 239.</ref> He addressed his ''Sonnet 16'' to 'The Lord Generall Cromwell in May 1652' beginning  \"Cromwell, our chief of men...\", although it was not published until 1654.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=POOLEY|first=ROGER|date=1993|title=The poets' Cromwell|journal=Critical Survey|volume=5|issue=3|pages=223\u2013234|jstor=41555744}}</ref>\n\nIn 1654, Milton completed the second defence of the English nation ''Defensio secunda'' in response to an anonymous Royalist tract ''\"Regii Sanguinis Clamor ad Coelum Adversus Parricidas Anglicanos\"'' [The Cry of the Royal Blood to Heaven  Against the English Parricides], a work that made many personal attacks on Milton.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cOoXuk5wEbQC&dq=Regii+sanguinis+clam+royalist|title=The Milton Encyclopedia|last=Corns|first=Thomas N.|date=2012|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0300094442|location=|pages=216}}</ref> The second defence praised [[Oliver Cromwell]], now Lord Protector, while exhorting him to remain true to the principles of the Revolution. [[Alexander Morus]], to whom Milton wrongly attributed the ''Clamor'' (in fact by [[Peter du Moulin]]), published an attack on Milton, in response to which Milton published the autobiographical ''Defensio pro se'' in 1655. Milton held the appointment of Secretary for Foreign Tongues to the Commonwealth Council of State until 1660, although after he had become totally blind, most of the work was done by his deputies, Georg Rudolph Wecklein, then Philip Meadows, and from 1657 by the poet [[Andrew Marvell]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.historytoday.com/richard-cavendish/milton-appointed-latin-secretary|title=Milton appointed Latin Secretary {{!}} History Today|website=www.historytoday.com|accessdate=3 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nBy 1652, Milton had become totally blind;<ref>John Leonard, in the introduction to \"Paradise Lost\", Penguin Classics page ix  2000</ref> the cause of his blindness is debated but bilateral [[retinal detachment]] or [[glaucoma]] are most likely.<ref name=pmid18168884>{{cite journal|last=Sorsby|first=A.|title=On The Nature of Milton's Blindness|journal=British Journal of Ophthalmology|year=1930|volume=14|issue=7|pages=339\u201354|pmid=18168884|pmc=511199|doi=10.1136/bjo.14.7.339}}</ref> His blindness forced him to dictate his [[verse (poetry)|verse]] and prose to [[amanuensis|amanuenses]] who copied them out for him; one of these was poet Andrew Marvell.

Milton, however, stubbornly clung to the beliefs that had originally inspired him to write for the Commonwealth. In 1659, he published ''[[A Treatise of Civil Power]]'', attacking the concept of a state-dominated church (the position known as [[Erastianism]]), as well as ''Considerations touching the likeliest means to remove hirelings'', denouncing corrupt practises in church governance. As the Republic disintegrated, Milton wrote several proposals to retain a non-monarchical government against the wishes of parliament, soldiers, and the people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.christs.cam.ac.uk/john-milton/miltons-works|title=Milton's Works|date=3 February 2017|website=Milton's Works|publisher=Christ's College Cambridge}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lewalski|first=Barbara Kiefer|year=1959|title=Milton: Political Beliefs and Polemical Methods, 1659\u201360|jstor=460581|journal=PMLA|volume=74|issue=3|pages=191\u2013202|doi=10.2307/460581}}</ref>\n\n*''A Letter to a Friend, Concerning the Ruptures of the Commonwealth'', written in October 1659, was a response to [[John Lambert (general)|General Lambert]]'s recent dissolution of the [[Rump Parliament]].\n*''Proposals of certain expedients for the preventing of a civil war now feared'', written in November 1659.\n*''[[The Ready and Easy Way to Establishing a Free Commonwealth]]'', in two editions, responded to [[George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle|General Monck]]'s march towards London to restore the [[Long Parliament]] (which led to the restoration of the monarchy). The work is an impassioned, bitter, and futile [[jeremiad]] damning the English people for backsliding from the cause of [[liberty]] and advocating the establishment of an authoritarian rule by an [[oligarchy]] set up by unelected parliament.\n\nUpon the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] in May 1660, Milton went into hiding for his life, while a warrant was issued for his arrest and his writings were burnt. He re-emerged after [[Indemnity and Oblivion Act|a general pardon]] was issued, but was nevertheless arrested and briefly imprisoned before influential friends intervened, such as Marvell, now an MP. Milton married for a third and final time on 24 February 1663, marrying Elizabeth (Betty) Minshull, aged 24, a native of [[Wistaston]], Cheshire. He spent the remaining decade of his life living quietly in London, only retiring to a cottage during the [[Great Plague of London]]\u2014[[Milton's Cottage]] in [[Chalfont St. Giles]], his only extant home.\n\nDuring this period, Milton published several minor prose works, such as the grammar textbook ''Art of Logic'' and a ''History of Britain''. His only explicitly political tracts were the 1672 ''Of True Religion'', arguing for [[toleration]] (except for Catholics), and a translation of a Polish tract advocating an elective monarchy. Both these works were referred to in the [[Exclusion Bill|Exclusion]] debate, the attempt to exclude the heir presumptive from the throne of England\u2014[[James, Duke of York]]\u2014because he was Roman Catholic. That debate preoccupied politics in the 1670s and 1680s and precipitated the formation of the [[British Whig Party|Whig party]] and the [[Glorious Revolution]].\n\nMilton died of kidney failure on 8 November 1674 and was buried in the church of [[St Giles-without-Cripplegate]], [[Fore Street, London|Fore Street]], London.<ref name=EncylLon>{{cite book|author1=[[Christopher Hibbert|Hibbert, Christopher]]; Ben Weinreb; John Keay; Julia Keay.|title=The London Encyclopaedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xa0D0PqiwfEC&pg=PA762|year=2010|location=London|publisher=Pan Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-73878-2|page=762}}</ref> According to an early biographer, his funeral was attended by \"his learned and great Friends in London, not without a friendly concourse of the Vulgar.\"<ref>Toland 1932 p. 193.</ref> A monument was added in 1793, sculpted by [[John Bacon (sculptor, born 1740)|John Bacon the Elder]].\n\n===Family===\nMilton and his first wife Mary Powell (1625\u20131652) had four children:\n*Anne (born 7 July 1646)\n*Mary (born 25 October 1648)\n*John (16 March 1651 \u2013 June 1652)\n*Deborah (2 May 1652 \u2013 10 August 1727<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Monthly Mirror: Reflecting Men and Manners|publisher=Harding & Wright|year=1810|location=Edinburgh|pages=49|quote=|via=Google Books}}</ref>)\n\nMary Powell died on 5 May 1652 from complications following Deborah's birth.

The marriage took place at [[St Mary Aldermary]] in the City of London. Despite a 31-year age gap, the marriage seemed happy, according to [[John Aubrey]], and lasted more than 12 years until Milton's death. (A plaque on the wall of Mynshull's House in Manchester describes Elizabeth as Milton's \"3rd and Best wife\".) Samuel Johnson, however, claims that Mynshull was \"a domestic companion and attendant\" and that Milton's nephew [[Edward Phillips]] relates that Mynshull \"oppressed his children in his lifetime, and cheated them at his death\".<ref>Johnson 1826 Vol. I 86.</ref>\n\nHis nephews, [[Edward Phillips|Edward]] and [[John Phillips (author)|John Phillips]] (sons of Milton's sister Anne), were educated by Milton and became writers themselves. John acted as a secretary, and Edward was Milton's first biographer.\n\n==Poetry==\nMilton's poetry was slow to see the light of day, at least under his name. His first published poem was \"On Shakespeare\" (1630), anonymously included in the [[Second Folio]] edition of [[William Shakespeare]]'s plays in 1632. An annoted copy of the [[First Folio]] has been suggested to contain marginal notes by Milton.<ref>Flood, Alison,  ''[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/16/when-milton-met-shakespeare-poets-notes-on-bard-appear-to-have-been-found?

The anonymous edition of ''Comus'' was published in 1637, and the publication of ''Lycidas'' in 1638 in ''Justa Edouardo King Naufrago'' was signed J. M. Otherwise.

In 1673, Milton republished his ''1645 Poems'', as well as a collection of his letters and the Latin prolusions from his Cambridge days.\n\n==Views==\nAn unfinished religious manifesto, ''[[De Doctrina Christiana (Milton)|De doctrina christiana]]'', probably written by Milton, lays out many of his heterodox theological views, and was not discovered and published until 1823. Milton's key beliefs were idiosyncratic, not those of an identifiable group or faction, and often they go well beyond the orthodoxy of the time. Their tone, however, stemmed from the Puritan emphasis on the centrality and inviolability of conscience.<ref>See, for instance, Barker, Arthur. ''Milton and the Puritan Dilemma, 1641\u20131660''.

According to Fallon, Milton's monism is most notably reflected in ''Paradise Lost'' when he has angels eat (5.433\u201339){{clarify|date=May 2012}} and apparently engage in sexual intercourse (8.622\u201329){{clarify|date=May 2012}} and the ''De Doctrina'', where he denies the dual natures of man and argues for a theory of Creation [[Ex nihilo|''ex Deo'']].\n\n===Political thought===\n{{Main|John Milton's politics}}Milton was a \"passionately individual Christian Humanist poet.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=A Critical History of English Literature, Vol. I|last=Daiches|first=David|publisher=Seeker & Warburg|year=1960|isbn=|location=London|pages=457}}</ref> He appears on the pages of seventeenth century English Puritanism, an age characterized as \"the world turned upside down.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The world turned upside down : radical ideas during the English revolution|last=Hill|first=Christopher|publisher=Penguin|year=1984|isbn=9780140137323|location=London|pages=}}</ref> He is a Puritan and yet is unwilling to surrender conscience to party positions on public policy.

After his divorce writings, ''Areopagitica'', and a gap, he wrote in 1649\u201354 in the aftermath of the [[execution of Charles I]], and in polemic justification of the regicide and the existing Parliamentarian regime. Then in 1659\u201360 he foresaw the Restoration, and wrote to head it off.<ref>Blair Worden, ''Literature and Politics in Cromwellian England: John Milton, Andrew Marvell and Marchamont Nedham'' (2007), p. 154.</ref>\n\nMilton's own beliefs were in some cases both unpopular and dangerous, and this was true particularly to his commitment to [[republicanism]].

John Milton wrestled with the great doctrines of the Church amidst the theological crosswinds of his age. The great Poet was undoubtedly Reformed (though his grandfather, Richard \"the Ranger\" Milton had been Roman Catholic).<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=The Arms of the Family: The Significance of John Milton's Relatives and Associates|last=Shawcross|first=John T.|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|year=2004|isbn=978-0813122915|location=Lexington|pages=7}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=In the Days of Milton|last=Jenks|first=Tudor|publisher=A.S. Barnes & Company|year=1905|isbn=|location=New York|pages=35\u201336}}</ref> However, Milton's Calvinism had to find expression in a broad-spirited Humanism. Like many [[Renaissance]] artists before him, Milton attempted to integrate Christian theology with classical modes. In his early poems, the poet narrator expresses a tension between vice and virtue, the latter invariably related to Protestantism. In ''Comus'', Milton may make ironic use of the [[Charles I of England|Caroline]] court [[masque]] by elevating notions of purity and virtue over the conventions of court revelry and superstition. In his later poems, Milton's theological concerns become more explicit.\n\nHis use of biblical citation was wide-ranging; Harris Fletcher, standing at the beginning of the intensification of the study of the use of scripture in Milton's work (poetry and prose, in all languages Milton mastered), notes that typically Milton clipped and adapted biblical quotations to suit the purpose, giving precise chapter and verse only in texts for a more specialized readership. As for the plenitude of Milton's quotations from scripture, Fletcher comments, \"For this work, I have in all actually collated about twenty-five hundred of the five to ten thousand direct Biblical quotations which appear therein\".<ref name=harris/> Milton's customary English Bible was the [[King James Version#Authorized Version|Authorized King James]].<ref>{{cite journal|first=E.

He has been accused of rejecting the [[Trinity]], believing instead that the Son was subordinate to the Father, a position known as [[Arianism]]; and his sympathy or curiosity was probably engaged by [[Socinianism]]: in August 1650 he licensed for publication by [[William Dugard]] the ''[[Racovian Catechism]]'', based on a non-trinitarian creed.<ref>Lewalski, ''Life of Milton'', p. 253.</ref><ref>William Bridges Hunter, ''A Milton Encyclopedia'' (1980), Vol. VIII, p. 13.</ref> Milton's alleged Arianism, like much of his theology, is still subject of debate and controversy. [[Rufus Wilmot Griswold]] argued that \"In none of his great works is there a passage from which it can be inferred that he was an Arian; and in the very last of his writings he declares that \"the doctrine of the Trinity is a plain doctrine in Scripture.\"<ref>John Milton, The Prose Works of John Milton: With a Biographical Introduction by Rufus Wilmot Griswold. In Two Volumes (Philadelphia: John W. Moore, 1847). Vol. 1. [[wikisource:The Prose Works of John Milton/Biographical introduction|The Prose Works of John Milton, Biographical introduction]]</ref> In ''Areopagitica,'' Milton classified Arians and Socinians as \"errorists\" and \"schismatics\" alongside [[Arminians]] and [[Anabaptists]].<ref>W.F. Draper, \"The Religious Life and Opinions of John Milton.\" In \"The Bibliotheca Sacra and Biblical Repository,\" Volume 17 (1860) p. 38.</ref> A source has interpreted him as broadly Protestant, if not always easy to locate in a more precise religious category.\n\nIn his 1641 treatise, ''[[Of Reformation]]'', Milton expressed his dislike for Catholicism and episcopacy, presenting Rome as a modern [[Babylon]], and bishops as Egyptian taskmasters. These analogies conform to Milton's puritanical preference for [[Old Testament]] imagery. He knew at least four commentaries on ''Genesis'': those of [[John Calvin]], [[Paulus Fagius]], [[David Pareus]] and [[Andreus Rivetus]].<ref>Arnold Williams, ''Renaissance Commentaries on \"Genesis\" and Some Elements of the Theology of Paradise Lost'', PMLA, Vol. 56, No. 1 (Mar. 1941), pp. 151\u201364.</ref>\n\nThrough the [[Interregnum (1649\u20131660)|Interregnum]], Milton often presents England, rescued from the trappings of a worldly monarchy, as an [[elect]] nation akin to the Old Testament [[Israel]], and shows its leader, [[Oliver Cromwell]], as a latter-day [[Moses]]. These views were bound up in Protestant views of the [[Millennium]], which some sects, such as the [[Fifth Monarchists]] predicted would arrive in England. Milton, however, would later criticise the \"worldly\" millenarian views of these and others, and expressed orthodox ideas on the prophecy of the [[Four Empires]].<ref>Walter S. H. Lim, ''John Milton, Radical Politics, and Biblical Republicanism'' (2006), p. 141.</ref>\n\nThe Restoration of the Stuart monarchy in 1660 began a new phase in Milton's work. In ''Paradise Lost'', ''[[Paradise Regained]]'' and ''[[Samson Agonistes]]'', Milton mourns the end of the godly [[English Commonwealth|Commonwealth]]. The [[Garden of Eden]] may allegorically reflect Milton's view of England's recent [[The Fall of Man|Fall from Grace]], while [[Samson]]'s blindness and captivity\u2014mirroring Milton's own lost sight\u2014may be a metaphor for England's blind acceptance of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] as king.\nIllustrated by ''Paradise Lost'' is [[Soul sleep|mortalism]], the belief that the soul lies dormant after the body dies.<ref>John Rogers, ''The Matter of Revolution'' (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1998), p. xi.</ref>\n\nDespite the Restoration of the monarchy, Milton did not lose his personal faith; Samson shows how the loss of national [[salvation]] did not necessarily preclude the salvation of the individual, while ''Paradise Regained'' expresses Milton's continuing belief in the promise of Christian salvation through Jesus Christ.\n\nThough he maintained his personal faith in spite of the defeats suffered by his cause, the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' recounted how he had been alienated from the Church of England by Archbishop William Laud, and then moved similarly from the [[Dissenters]] by their denunciation of religious tolerance in England.\n\n{{quote|Milton had come to stand apart from all sects, though apparently finding the [[Quakers]] most congenial. He never went to any religious services in his later years. When a servant brought back accounts of sermons from [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformist]] meetings, Milton became so sarcastic that the man at last gave up his place.}}Writing of the enigmatic and often conflicting views of Milton in the Puritan age, David Daiches wrote convincingly,<blockquote>\"Christian and Humanist, Protestant, patriot and heir of the golden ages of Greece and Rome, he faced what appeared to him to be the birth-pangs of a new and regenerate England with high excitement and idealistic optimism.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>A fair theological summary may be: that John Milton was a Puritan, though his tendency to press further for liberty of conscience, sometimes out of conviction and often out of mere intellectual curiosity, made the great man, at least, a vital if not uncomfortable ally in the broader Puritan movement.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Religious toleration===\nMilton called in the ''[[Areopagitica]]'' for \"the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely according to conscience, above all liberties\" (applied, however, only to the conflicting Protestant denominations, and not to atheists, Jews, Muslims or Catholics).<ref>Hill, C.

In August of that year, he presented his thoughts to the [[Westminster Assembly of Divines]], which had been created by the [[Long Parliament]] to bring greater reform to the Church of England. The Assembly convened on 1 July against the will of King Charles I.\n\nMilton's thinking on divorce caused him considerable trouble with the authorities. An orthodox Presbyterian view of the time was that Milton's views on divorce constituted a one-man [[heresy]]:\n\n{{quote|The fervently Presbyterian [[Thomas Edwards (heresiographer)|Edwards]] had included Milton's divorce tracts in his list in ''[[Gangraena]]'' of heretical publications that threatened the religious and moral fabric of the nation; Milton responded by mocking him as \"shallow Edwards\" in the satirical sonnet \"On the New Forcers of Conscience under the Long Parliament\", usually dated to the latter half of 1646.<ref>[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/119394388/PDFSTART (PDF) Nicholas McDowell, ''Family Politics; Or, How John Phillips Read His Uncle's Satirical Sonnets'', Milton Quarterly Vol. 42 Issue 1, pp. 1\u201321.

However, Milton's basic approval of divorce within strict parameters set by the biblical witness was typical of many influential Christian intellectuals, particularly the Westminster divines. Milton addressed the Assembly on the matter of divorce in August 1643,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~milton/reading_room/ddd/book_1/notes.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=10 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704170506/http://www.dartmouth.edu/~milton/reading_room/ddd/book_1/notes.shtml |archivedate= 4 July 2013 }}</ref> at a moment when the Assembly was beginning to form its opinion on the matter. In the Doctrine & Discipline of Divorce, Milton argued that divorce was a private matter, not a legal or ecclesiastical one. Neither the Assembly nor Parliament condemned Milton or his ideas. In fact, when the Westminster Assembly wrote the Westminster Confession of Faith they allowed for divorce ('Of Marriage and Divorce,' Chapter 24, Section 5) in cases of infidelity or abandonment. Thus, the Christian community, at least a majority within the 'Puritan' sub-set, approved of Milton's views.\n\nNevertheless, reaction among Puritans to Milton's views on divorce was mixed. [[Herbert Palmer (Puritan)|Herbert Palmer]], a member of the [[Westminster Assembly]], condemned Milton in the strongest possible language:\n\n{{quote|If any plead Conscience ... for divorce for other causes than Christ and His Apostles mention; Of which a wicked booke is abroad and uncensured, though deserving to be burnt, whose Author, hath been so impudent as to set his Name to it, and dedicate it to your selves ... will you grant a Toleration for all this?|The Glasse of God's Providence Towards His Faithfull Ones, 1644, p. 54.<ref>Ernest Sirluck, \"Introduction\", Complete Prose Works of John Milton, New Haven: Yale U.

He cast a formidable shadow over English poetry in the 18th and 19th centuries; he was often judged equal or superior to all other English poets, including [[Shakespeare]]. Very early on, though, he was championed by [[Whig (British political faction)|Whigs]], and decried by [[Tories]]: with the regicide [[Edmund Ludlow]] he was claimed as an early Whig,<ref>[[Kevin Sharpe (historian)|Kevin Sharpe]], ''Remapping Early Modern England: The Culture of Seventeenth-century Politics'' (2000), p. 7.</ref> while the High Tory Anglican minister [[Luke Milbourne]] lumped Milton in with other \"Agents of Darkness\" such as [[John Knox]], [[George Buchanan]], [[Richard Baxter]], [[Algernon Sidney]] and [[John Locke]].<ref>[[J.

Levine, ''The Battle of the Books: History and Literature in the Augustan Age'' (1994), p. 247.</ref>\n\nIn 1732, the classical scholar [[Richard Bentley]] offered a corrected version of ''Paradise Lost''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://JackLynch.net/Texts/Bentley/ |title=Online text of one book |publisher=Andromeda.rutgers.edu |accessdate=4 January 2010}}</ref> Bentley was considered presumptuous, and was attacked in the following year by [[Zachary Pearce]].

A subsequent prose translation by [[Johann Jakob Bodmer]] was very popular; it influenced Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock. The German-language Milton tradition returned to England in the person of the artist [[Henry Fuseli]].\n\nMany enlightenment thinkers of the 18th century revered and commented on Milton's poetry and non-poetical works. In addition to John Dryden, among them were [[Alexander Pope]], [[Joseph Addison]], [[Thomas Newton]], and [[Samuel Johnson]]. For example, in ''[[The Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]]'',<ref>Nos 267, 273, 279, 285, 291, 297, 303, 309, 315, 321, 327, 333, 339, 345, 351, 357, 363, and 369.</ref> Joseph Addison wrote extensive notes, annotations, and interpretations of certain passages of ''Paradise Lost''. [[Jonathan Richardson (painter)|Jonathan Richardson, senior]], and Jonathan Richardson, the younger, co-wrote a book of criticism.<ref>''Explanatory Notes and Remarks on Milton's Paradise Lost'' (1734).</ref> In 1749, Thomas Newton published an extensive edition of Milton's poetical works with annotations provided by himself, Dryden, Pope, Addison, the Richardsons (father and son) and others. Newton's edition of Milton was a culmination of the honour bestowed upon Milton by early Enlightenment thinkers; it may also have been prompted by Richard Bentley's infamous edition, described above. Samuel Johnson wrote numerous essays on ''Paradise Lost'', and Milton was included in his ''[[Lives of the Most Eminent English Poets]]'' (1779\u20131781). In ''[[The Age of Louis XIV]]'', [[Voltaire]] said \"Milton remains the glory and the wonder (''l'admiration'') of England.\"<ref>Voltaire, ''Le Siecle de Louis XIV 2,'' Paris: Garnier-Flammarion, 1966, p.66.</ref>\n\n===Blake===\n[[File:Milton a Poem copy D 1818 Library of Congress object 1.jpg|thumb|[[Frontispiece (book)|Frontispiece]] to ''[[Milton: A Poem in Two Books]]'']]\n\n[[William Blake]] considered Milton the major English poet.

Foster Damon]], ''A Blake Dictionary'' (1973), p. 274.</ref> In his ''[[Milton: A Poem in Two Books]]'', Blake uses Milton as a character.\n\n===Romantic theory===\n[[Edmund Burke]] was a theorist of the [[sublime (literary)|sublime]], and he regarded Milton's description of Hell as exemplary of sublimity as an [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] concept. For Burke, it was to set alongside mountain-tops, a storm at sea, and [[infinity]].<ref>Bill Beckley, ''Sticky Sublime'' (2001), p. 63.</ref> In ''The Beautiful and the Sublime'', he wrote: \"No person seems better to have understood the secret of heightening, or of setting terrible things, if I may use the expression, in their strongest light, by the force of a judicious obscurity than Milton.\"<ref>Part II, Section I: [http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/b/burke/edmund/sublime/part2.html Adelaide.edu.au] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081026004530/http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/b/burke/edmund/sublime/part2.html |date=26 October 2008 }}.</ref>\n\nThe [[Romanticism|Romantic poets]] valued his exploration of [[blank verse]], but for the most part rejected his religiosity.

''George Eliot's Dialogue with Milton''.</ref> and [[Thomas Hardy]] being particularly inspired by Milton's poetry and biography. Hostile 20th-century criticism by [[T. S.

Eliot believed that \"of no other poet is it so difficult to consider the poetry simply as poetry, without our theological and political dispositions... making unlawful entry\".<ref>Eliot 1947 p. 63.</ref>\n\n===Literary legacy===\n[[File:Temple of British Worthies John Milton.jpg|thumb|Statue of Milton in [[Stowe House|Temple of British Worthies]], [[Stowe, Buckinghamshire|Stowe]]]]\n\nMilton's use of [[blank verse]], in addition to his stylistic innovations (such as grandiloquence of voice and vision, peculiar diction and phraseology) influenced later poets. At the time, poetic blank verse was considered distinct from its use in verse drama, and ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' was taken as a unique examplar.<ref>Saintsbury 1908 ii. 443.</ref> Said [[Isaac Watts]] in 1734, \"Mr. Milton is esteemed the parent and author of blank verse among us\".<ref>Watts 1810 iv. 619.</ref> \"Miltonic verse\" might be synonymous for a century with blank verse as poetry, a new poetic terrain independent from both the drama and the [[heroic couplet]].\n\nLack of rhyme was sometimes taken as Milton's defining innovation. He himself considered the rhymeless quality of ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' to be an extension of his own personal liberty:\n\n{{quote|This neglect then of Rhime&nbsp;... is to be esteem'd an example set, the first in English, of ancient liberty recover'd to heroic Poem from the troublesom and modern bondage of Rimeing.<ref>Milton 1668 xi.</ref>}}\n\nThis pursuit of freedom was largely a reaction against conservative values entrenched within the rigid heroic couplet.<ref>Gordon 2008 p. 234.</ref> Within a dominant culture that stressed elegance and finish, he granted primacy to freedom, breadth and imaginative suggestiveness, eventually developed into the romantic vision of sublime terror. Reaction to Milton's poetic worldview included, grudgingly, acknowledgement that of poet's resemblance to classical writers (Greek and Roman poetry being unrhymed). Blank verse came to be a recognised medium for religious works and for translations of the classics. Unrhymed lyrics like [[William Collins (poet)|Collins]]' ''[[Ode to Evening]]'' (in the meter of Milton's translation of [[Horace]]'s ''[[Ode to Pyrrha]]'') were not uncommon after 1740.<ref>Dexter 1922 p. 46.</ref>\n\nA second aspect of Milton's blank verse was the use of unconventional rhythm:\n\n{{quote|His blank-verse paragraph, and his audacious and victorious attempt to combine blank and rhymed verse with paragraphic effect in Lycidas, lay down indestructible models and patterns of English verse-rhythm, as distinguished from the narrower and more strait-laced forms of English metre.<ref>Saintsbury 1908 ii. 457.</ref>}}\n\nBefore Milton, \"the sense of regular rhythm&nbsp;... had been knocked into the English head so securely that it was part of their nature\".<ref>Saintsbury 1916 p. 101.</ref> The \"Heroick measure\", according to [[Samuel Johnson]], \"is pure&nbsp;... when the accent rests upon every second syllable through the whole line&nbsp;... The repetition of this sound or percussion at equal times, is the most complete harmony of which a single verse is capable\".<ref>Johnson 1751 no. 86.</ref> [[Caesura]]l pauses, most agreed, were best placed at the middle and the end of the line. In order to support this symmetry, lines were most often octo- or deca-syllabic, with no [[enjambed]] endings. To this schema Milton introduced modifications, which included [[hypermetric]]al [[syllable]]s (trisyllabic [[Foot (prosody)|feet]]), [[inversion (prosody)|inversion]] or slighting of [[stress (linguistics)|stresses]], and the shifting of pauses to all parts of the line.<ref>Dexter 1922 p. 57.</ref> Milton deemed these features to be reflective of \"the transcendental union of order and freedom\".<ref>Saintsbury 1908 ii. 458\u201359.</ref> Admirers remained hesitant to adopt such departures from traditional metrical schemes: \"The English&nbsp;... had been writing separate lines for so long that they could not rid themselves of the habit\".<ref>Dexter 1922 p. 59.</ref> Isaac Watts preferred his lines distinct from each other, as did [[Oliver Goldsmith]], [[Henry Pemberton]], and [[Scott of Amwell]], whose general opinion it was that Milton's frequent omission of the initial unaccented foot was \"displeasing to a nice ear\".<ref>Saintsbury 1916 p. 114.</ref> It was not until the late 18th century that poets (beginning with [[Thomas Gray|Gray]]) began to appreciate \"the composition of Milton's harmony&nbsp;... how he loved to vary his pauses, his measures, and his feet, which gives that enchanting air of freedom and wilderness to his versification\".<ref>Gray 1748 ''Observations on English Metre''.</ref> By the 20th century, American poet and critic John Hollander would go so far as to say that Milton \"was able, by plying that most remarkable instrument of English meter ... to invent a new mode of image-making in English poetry.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/visionresonancet0000holl/page/116|title=Vision and resonance : two senses of poetic form|last=Hollander|first=John|date=1975|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=0-19-501898-2|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/visionresonancet0000holl/page/116 116]|oclc=1530446}}</ref>\n\n[[File:St Giles-without-Cripplegate, London 01.JPG|thumb|Memorial in [[St Giles-without-Cripplegate]], London]]\n\nWhile [[neoclassicism|neo-classical]] diction was as restrictive as its [[prosody (poetry)|prosody]], and narrow imagery paired with uniformity of sentence structure resulted in a small set of 800 nouns circumscribing the vocabulary of 90% of heroic couplets ever written up to the eighteenth century,<ref>Hobsbaum 1996 p. 40.</ref> and tradition required that the same adjectives attach to the same nouns, followed by the same verbs, Milton's pursuit of liberty extended into his vocabulary as well. It included many Latinate [[neologism]]s, as well as obsolete words already dropped from popular usage so completely that their meanings were no longer understood. In 1740, [[Francis Peck]] identified some examples of Milton's \"old\" words (now popular).<ref>They included \"self-same\", \"hue\", \"minstrelsy\", \"murky\", \"carol\", and \"chaunt\". Among Milton's naturalized Latin words were \"humid\", \"orient\", \"hostil\", \"facil\", \"fervid\", \"jubilant\", \"ire\", \"bland\", \"reluctant\", \"palpable\", \"fragil\", and \"ornate\". Peck 1740 pp. 110\u201311.</ref> The \"Miltonian dialect\", as it was called, was emulated by later poets; Pope used the diction of ''Paradise Lost'' in his [[Homer]] translation, while the lyric poetry of Gray and Collins was frequently criticised for their use of \"obsolete words out of Spenser and Milton\".<ref>Scott 1785 63.</ref> The language of [[James Thomson (poet)|Thomson]]'s finest poems (e.g. ''[[The Seasons (Thomson poem)|The Seasons]]'', ''[[The Castle of Indolence]]'') was self-consciously modelled after the Miltonian dialect, with the same tone and sensibilities as ''Paradise Lost''.

Milton also wrote the hymn [[Let us with a gladsome mind]], a versification of Psalm 136.

He wrote at a time of religious flux and political upheaval, and is best known for his [[epic poetry|epic poem]] ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (1667), written in [[blank verse]], and widely considered to be one of the greatest works of literature ever written.\n\nWriting in English, Latin, Greek, and Italian, he achieved international renown within his lifetime; his celebrated ''[[Areopagitica]]'' (1644), written in condemnation of [[Prior restraint|pre-publication censorship]], is among history's most influential and impassioned defences of [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of the press]]. His desire for freedom extended into his style: he introduced new words (coined from Latin) to the English language, and was the first modern writer to employ unrhymed verse outside of the theatre or translations.\n\n[[William Hayley]]'s 1796 biography called him the \"greatest English author\",<ref>McCalman 2001 p. 605.</ref> and he remains generally regarded \"as one of the preeminent writers in the English language\",<ref>''Contemporary Literary Criticism''. [http://www.enotes.com/literary-criticism/milton-john \"Milton, John \u2013 Introduction\"].</ref> though critical reception has oscillated in the centuries since his death (often on account of his [[republicanism]]). [[Samuel Johnson]] praised ''Paradise Lost'' as \"a poem which...with respect to design may claim the first place, and with respect to performance, the second, among the productions of the human mind\", though he (a [[Tory]] and recipient of royal patronage) described Milton's politics as those of an \"acrimonious and surly republican\".<ref name=Works>{{cite book|last=Murphy|first=Arthur|title=The Works of Samuel Johnson, LL.

Milton studied, travelled, wrote poetry mostly for private circulation, and launched a career as pamphleteer and publicist under the increasingly personal rule of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and its breakdown into constitutional confusion and war. The shift in accepted attitudes in government placed him in public office under the [[Commonwealth of England]], from being thought dangerously radical and even heretical, and he even acted as an official spokesman in certain of his publications. The [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of 1660 deprived Milton, now completely blind, of his public platform, but this period saw him complete most of his major works of poetry.\n\nMilton's views developed from his very extensive reading, as well as travel and experience, from his student days of the 1620s to the [[English Civil War]].<ref>Masson 1859 pp. v\u2013vi.</ref> By the time of his death in 1674, Milton was impoverished and on the margins of English intellectual life, yet famous throughout Europe and unrepentant for his political choices.\n\n===Early life===\n{{Main|Early life of John Milton}}\n[[File:John Milton plaque Bread Street London.jpg|thumb|left|Blue plaque in Bread Street, London, where Milton was born]]\n\nJohn Milton was born in Bread Street, London on 9 December 1608, the son of composer [[John Milton (composer)|John Milton]] and his wife Sarah Jeffrey. The senior John Milton (1562\u20131647) moved to London around 1583 after being disinherited by his devout Catholic father Richard \"the Ranger\" Milton for embracing Protestantism.<ref name=\":3\" /> In London, the senior John Milton married Sarah Jeffrey (1572\u20131637) and found lasting financial success as a [[scrivener]].<ref name=Forsyth16>{{cite book |last=Forsyth |first=Neil |title=John Milton A Biography |edition=1st |year=2008 |publisher=[[Lion Hudson]] |location=Wilkinson House, Jordan Hill Road, Oxford OX2 8DR, England |isbn=978-0-7459-5310-6 |page=[https://archive.org/details/johnmiltonbiogra0000fors/page/16 16] |chapter=St. Paul's |url=https://archive.org/details/johnmiltonbiogra0000fors/page/16 }}</ref> He lived in and worked from a house on [[Bread Street]], where the [[Mermaid Tavern]] was located in [[Cheapside]]. The elder Milton was noted for his skill as a musical composer, and this talent left his son with a lifelong appreciation for music and friendships with musicians such as [[Henry Lawes]].<ref>Lewalski 2003 p. 3.</ref>\n\nMilton's father's prosperity provided his eldest son with a private tutor, [[Thomas Young (1587\u20131655)|Thomas Young]], a Scottish Presbyterian with an M.A. from the University of St. Andrews. Research suggests that Young's influence served as the poet's introduction to religious radicalism.<ref>Skerpan-Wheeler, Elizabeth. \"John Milton.\" British Rhetoricians and Logicians, 1500\u20131660: Second Series. Ed. Edward A. Malone. Detroit: Gale, 2003. Dictionary of Literary Biography Vol. 281. Literature Resource Center.</ref> After Young's tutorship, Milton attended [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's School]] in London. There he began the study of Latin and Greek, and the classical languages left an imprint on both his poetry and prose in English (he also wrote in Italian and Latin).\n\n[[File:John Milton portrait.jpg|thumb|John Milton at age 10 by [[Cornelis Janssens van Ceulen]]. In [[Milton's Cottage]], [[Chalfont St Giles]].]]\n\nMilton's first datable compositions are two psalms done at age 15 at [[Long Bennington]]. One contemporary source is the ''[[Brief Lives]]'' of [[John Aubrey]], an uneven compilation including first-hand reports. In the work, Aubrey quotes Christopher, Milton's younger brother: \"When he was young, he studied very hard and sat up very late, commonly till twelve or one o'clock at night\". Aubrey adds, \"\"His complexion exceeding faire\u2014he was so faire that they called him the Lady of Christ's College.\"<ref name=OLD>Dick 1962 pp. 270\u201375.</ref>\n\nIn 1625, Milton began attending [[Christ's College, Cambridge]]. He graduated with a B.A. in 1629,<ref>{{acad|id=MLTN624J|name=Milton, John}}</ref> ranking fourth of 24&nbsp;honours graduates that year in the University of Cambridge.<ref>Hunter 1980 p. 99.</ref> Preparing to become an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] priest, Milton stayed on and obtained his [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|Master of Arts degree]] on 3 July 1632.\n\nMilton may have been [[rustication (academia)|rusticated]] (suspended) in his first year for quarrelling with his tutor, Bishop [[William Chappell (bishop)|William Chappell]]. He was certainly at home in London in the Lent Term 1626; there he wrote his ''Elegia Prima'', a first Latin [[elegy]], to Charles Diodati, a friend from St Paul's. Based on remarks of [[John Aubrey]], Chappell \"whipt\" Milton.<ref name=OLD/> This story is now disputed, though certainly Milton disliked Chappell.<ref>Wedgwood 1961 p. 178.</ref> Historian [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]] cautiously notes that Milton was \"apparently\" rusticated, and that the differences between Chappell and Milton may have been either religious or personal.<ref>Hill 1977 p. 34.</ref> It is also possible that, like [[Isaac Newton]] four decades later, Milton was sent home because of the [[Plague (disease)|plague]], by which Cambridge was badly affected in 1625. In 1626, Milton's tutor was Nathaniel Tovey.\n\nAt Cambridge, Milton was on good terms with [[Edward King (British poet)|Edward King]], for whom he later wrote \"[[Lycidas]]\". He also befriended Anglo-American dissident and theologian [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]]. Milton tutored Williams in Hebrew in exchange for lessons in Dutch.<ref>Pfeiffer 1955 pp. 363\u201373.</ref> Despite developing a reputation for poetic skill and general erudition, Milton experienced alienation from his peers and university life as a whole. Having once watched his fellow students attempting comedy upon the college stage, he later observed 'they thought themselves gallant men, and I thought them fools'.<ref>Milton 1959 pp. 887\u201388.</ref>\n\nMilton was disdainful of the university curriculum, which consisted of stilted formal debates conducted in Latin on abstruse topics. His own corpus is not devoid of humour, notably his sixth [[wikt:prolusion|prolusion]] and his epitaphs on the death of [[Thomas Hobson]]. While at Cambridge, he wrote a number of his well-known shorter English poems, among them \"On the Morning of Christ's Nativity\", his \"Epitaph on the admirable Dramaticke Poet, W. Shakespeare\" (his first poem to appear in print), ''[[L'Allegro]]'', and ''[[Il Penseroso]]''.\n\n===Study, poetry, and travel===\n{{Details|Early life of John Milton}}\n{{quote box\n|width=40%\n|quote=It appears in all his writings that he had the usual concomitant of great abilities, a lofty and steady confidence in himself, perhaps not without some contempt of others; for scarcely any man ever wrote so much, and praised so few. Of his praise he was very frugal; as he set its value high, and considered his mention of a name as a security against the waste of time, and a certain preservative from oblivion.<ref>Johnson 1826 Vol. I. p. 64.</ref>\n|source=\u2013 [[Samuel Johnson]], ''[[Lives of the Most Eminent English Poets]]''\n}}\n\nUpon receiving his M.A. in 1632, Milton retired to [[Hammersmith]], his father's new home since the previous year. He also lived at [[Horton, Berkshire|Horton]], Berkshire, from 1635 and undertook six years of self-directed private study. Hill argues that this was not retreat into a rural idyll; Hammersmith was then a \"suburban village\" falling into the orbit of London, and even Horton was becoming deforested and suffered from the plague.<ref>Hill 1977 p. 38.</ref> He read both ancient and modern works of theology, philosophy, history, politics, literature, and science in preparation for a prospective poetical career. Milton's intellectual development can be charted via entries in his [[commonplace book]] (like a scrapbook), now in the [[British Library]]. As a result of such intensive study, Milton is considered to be among the most learned of all English poets. In addition to his years of private study, Milton had command of Latin, Greek, Hebrew, French, Spanish, and Italian from his school and undergraduate days; he also added Old English to his linguistic repertoire in the 1650s while researching his ''History of Britain'', and probably acquired proficiency in Dutch soon after.<ref>Lewalski 2003 p. 103.</ref>\n\n[[File:John Milton plaque Berkyn Manor Farm Horton.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Commemorative blue plaque 'John Milton lived here 1632\u20131638' at Berkyn Manor Farm, [[Horton, Berkshire]]]]\n\nMilton continued to write poetry during this period of study; his ''[[Arcades (Milton)|Arcades]]'' and ''[[Comus (John Milton)|Comus]]'' were both commissioned for [[masques]] composed for noble patrons, connections of the Egerton family, and performed in 1632 and 1634 respectively. ''Comus'' argues for the virtuousness of [[temperance (virtue)|temperance]] and [[chastity]].  He contributed his [[pastoral]] [[elegy]] ''[[Lycidas]]'' to a memorial collection for one of his fellow-students at Cambridge.  Drafts of these poems are preserved in Milton's poetry notebook, known as the Trinity Manuscript because it is now kept at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], Cambridge.\n\nIn May 1638, Milton embarked upon a tour of France and Italy that lasted until July or August 1639.<ref>Chaney 1985 and 2000.</ref> His travels supplemented his study with new and direct experience of artistic and religious traditions, especially Roman Catholicism. He met famous theorists and intellectuals of the time, and was able to display his poetic skills. For specific details of what happened within Milton's \"[[grand tour]]\", there appears to be just one [[primary source]]: Milton's own ''[[Defensio Secunda]]''. There are other records, including some letters and some references in his other prose tracts, but the bulk of the information about the tour comes from a work that, according to [[Barbara Lewalski]], \"was not intended as autobiography but as rhetoric, designed to emphasise his sterling reputation with the learned of Europe.\"<ref>Lewalski 2003 pp. 87\u201388.</ref>\n\nHe first went to [[Calais]] and then on to Paris, riding horseback, with a letter from diplomat [[Henry Wotton]] to ambassador [[John Scudamore (ambassador)|John Scudamore]]. Through Scudamore, Milton met [[Hugo Grotius]], a Dutch law philosopher, playwright, and poet. Milton left France soon after this meeting. He travelled south from [[Nice, France|Nice]] to [[Genoa]], and then to [[Livorno]] and [[Pisa]]. He reached Florence in July 1638. While there, Milton enjoyed many of the sites and structures of the city. His candour of manner and erudite neo-Latin poetry earned him friends in Florentine intellectual circles, and he met the astronomer [[Galileo]] who was under [[house arrest]] at [[Arcetri]], as well as others.<ref>Lewalski 2003 pp. 88\u201394.</ref> Milton probably visited the Florentine Academy and the [[Accademia della Crusca]] along with smaller academies in the area, including the Apatisti and the [[Svogliati]].\n\n{{quote box |width=40% |quote=In [Florence], which I have always admired above all others because of the elegance, not just of its tongue, but also of its wit, I lingered for about two months. There I at once became the friend of many gentlemen eminent in rank and learning, whose private academies I frequented\u2014a Florentine institution which deserves great praise not only for promoting humane studies but also for encouraging friendly intercourse.<ref>Milton 1959 Vol. IV part I. pp. 615\u201317.</ref> |source=\u2013 Milton's account of Florence in ''Defensio Secunda''}}\n\nHe left Florence in September to continue to Rome. With the connections from Florence, Milton was able to have easy access to Rome's intellectual society. His poetic abilities impressed those like Giovanni Salzilli, who praised Milton within an epigram. In late October, Milton attended a dinner given by the [[English College, Rome]], despite his dislike for the [[Society of Jesus]], meeting English Catholics who were also guests\u2014theologian [[Henry Holden]] and the poet [[Patrick Cary]].<ref>Chaney 1985 and 2000 and Lewalski p. 96.</ref> He also attended musical events, including oratorios, operas, and melodramas. Milton left for [[Naples]] toward the end of November, where he stayed only for a month because of the Spanish control.<ref>Chaney 1985 p. 244\u201351 and Chaney 2000 p. 313.</ref> During that time, he was introduced to Giovanni Battista Manso, patron to both [[Torquato Tasso]] and to [[Giambattista Marino]].<ref>Lewalski 2003 pp. 94\u201398.</ref>\n\nOriginally, Milton wanted to leave Naples in order to travel to [[Sicily]] and then on to Greece, but he returned to England during the summer of 1639 because of what he claimed in ''Defensio Secunda''<ref>Lewalski 2003 p. 98.</ref> were \"sad tidings of civil war in England.\"<ref>Milton 1959 Vol. IV part I pp. 618\u201319.</ref> Matters became more complicated when Milton received word that his childhood friend Diodati had died. Milton in fact stayed another seven months on the continent, and spent time at [[Geneva]] with Diodati's uncle after he returned to Rome. In ''Defensio Secunda'', Milton proclaimed that he was warned against a return to Rome because of his frankness about religion, but he stayed in the city for two months and was able to experience [[Carnival]] and meet [[Lukas Holste]], a Vatican librarian who guided Milton through its collection. He was introduced to Cardinal [[Francesco Barberini (1597\u20131679)|Francesco Barberini]] who invited Milton to an opera hosted by the Cardinal. Around March, Milton travelled once again to Florence, staying there for two months, attending further meetings of the academies, and spending time with friends. After leaving Florence, he travelled through Lucca, Bologna, and Ferrara before coming to [[Venice]]. In Venice, Milton was exposed to a model of Republicanism, later important in his political writings, but he soon found another model when he travelled to Geneva. From Switzerland, Milton travelled to Paris and then to Calais before finally arriving back in England in either July or August 1639.<ref>Lewalski 2003 pp. 99\u2013109.</ref>\n\n===Civil war, prose tracts, and marriage===\n{{Main|Milton's antiprelatical tracts}}\n[[File:Areopagitica bridwell.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Title page of the 1644 edition of ''[[Areopagitica]]'']]\n\nOn returning to England where the [[Bishops' Wars]] presaged further armed conflict, Milton began to write prose [[tract (literature)|tracts]] against [[episcopacy]], in the service of the [[Puritan]] and [[Long Parliament|Parliamentary]] cause. Milton's first foray into polemics was ''Of Reformation touching Church Discipline in England'' (1641), followed by ''Of Prelatical Episcopacy'', the two defences of [[Smectymnuus]] (a group of Presbyterian divines named from their initials; the \"TY\" belonged to Milton's old tutor Thomas Young), and ''[[The Reason of Church-Government Urged against Prelaty]]''. He vigorously attacked the High-church party of the Church of England and their leader [[William Laud]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], with frequent passages of real eloquence lighting up the rough controversial style of the period, and deploying a wide knowledge of church history.\n\nHe was supported by his father's investments, but Milton became a private schoolmaster at this time, educating his nephews and other children of the well-to-do. This experience and discussions with educational reformer [[Samuel Hartlib]] led him to write his short tract ''[[Of Education]]'' in 1644, urging a reform of the national universities.\n\nIn June 1642, Milton paid a visit to the manor house at [[Forest Hill, Oxfordshire]], and returned with 16-year-old bride Mary Powell.<ref name=\"ODNB Milton\">{{cite journal|first=Gordon|last=Campbell|title=Milton, John (1608\u20131674)|journal=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|volume=1|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|edition=Online|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/18800|accessdate=25 October 2013|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/18800}} {{ODNBsub}}</ref><ref>Lobel 1957 pp. 122\u201334.</ref> Mary found life difficult with the severe 35-year-old schoolmaster and pamphleteer, and she returned to her family a month later. She did not return until 1645, partly because of the outbreak of the [[First English Civil War|Civil War]].<ref name=\"ODNB Milton\"/>\n\nIn the meantime, her desertion prompted Milton to publish [[Milton's divorce tracts|a series of pamphlets]] over the next three years arguing for the legality and morality of divorce. ([[Anna Beer]], one of Milton's most recent biographers, points to a lack of evidence and the dangers of cynicism in urging that it was not necessarily the case that the private life so animated the public polemicising.) In 1643, Milton had a brush with the authorities over these writings, in parallel with [[Hezekiah Woodward]], who had more trouble.<ref>Lewalski 2003 pp. 181\u201382, 600.</ref> It was the hostile response accorded the divorce tracts that spurred Milton to write ''[[Areopagitica|Areopagitica; A speech of Mr. John Milton for the Liberty of Unlicenc'd Printing, to the Parlament of England]]'', his celebrated attack on pre-printing censorship.  In ''Areopagitica'', Milton aligns himself with the parliamentary cause, and he also begins to synthesize the ideal of neo-Roman liberty with that of Christian liberty.<ref>Ann Hughes, 'Milton, Areopagitica, and the Parliamentary Cause', ''The Oxford Handbook of Milton'', ed.

Nicholas McDowell and Nigel Smith, Oxford University Press, 2009</ref>\n\n===Secretary for Foreign Tongues===\nWith the parliamentary victory in the Civil War, Milton used his pen in defence of the republican principles represented by the Commonwealth. ''[[The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates]]'' (1649) defended the right of the people to hold their rulers to account, and implicitly sanctioned the [[regicide]]; Milton's political reputation got him appointed Secretary for Foreign Tongues by the Council of State in March 1649. His main job description was to compose the English Republic's foreign correspondence in Latin, but he also was called upon to produce propaganda for the regime and to serve as a censor.<ref>C. Sullivan, 'Milton and the Beginning of Civil Service', in ''Literature in the Public Service'' (2013), Ch. 2.</ref>\n\n[[File:19 York Street, Westminster (1848).jpg|thumb|The back of no 19 York Street (1848).

Milton tried to break this powerful image of Charles I (the literal translation of Eikonoklastes is 'the image breaker'). A month later, however, the exiled [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and his party published the defence of monarchy ''Defensio Regia pro Carolo Primo'', written by leading humanist [[Claudius Salmasius]]. By January of the following year, Milton was ordered to write a defence of the English people by the [[English Council of State|Council of State]]. Milton worked more slowly than usual, given the European audience and the English Republic's desire to establish diplomatic and cultural legitimacy, as he drew on the learning marshalled by his years of study to compose a riposte.\n\nOn 24 February 1652, Milton published his Latin defence of the English people ''[[Defensio pro Populo Anglicano]]'', also known as the ''First Defence''.

The work is an impassioned, bitter, and futile [[jeremiad]] damning the English people for backsliding from the cause of [[liberty]] and advocating the establishment of an authoritarian rule by an [[oligarchy]] set up by unelected parliament.\n\nUpon the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] in May 1660, Milton went into hiding for his life, while a warrant was issued for his arrest and his writings were burnt. He re-emerged after [[Indemnity and Oblivion Act|a general pardon]] was issued, but was nevertheless arrested and briefly imprisoned before influential friends intervened, such as Marvell, now an MP. Milton married for a third and final time on 24 February 1663, marrying Elizabeth (Betty) Minshull, aged 24, a native of [[Wistaston]], Cheshire. He spent the remaining decade of his life living quietly in London, only retiring to a cottage during the [[Great Plague of London]]\u2014[[Milton's Cottage]] in [[Chalfont St. Giles]], his only extant home.\n\nDuring this period, Milton published several minor prose works, such as the grammar textbook ''Art of Logic'' and a ''History of Britain''. His only explicitly political tracts were the 1672 ''Of True Religion'', arguing for [[toleration]] (except for Catholics), and a translation of a Polish tract advocating an elective monarchy. Both these works were referred to in the [[Exclusion Bill|Exclusion]] debate, the attempt to exclude the heir presumptive from the throne of England\u2014[[James, Duke of York]]\u2014because he was Roman Catholic. That debate preoccupied politics in the 1670s and 1680s and precipitated the formation of the [[British Whig Party|Whig party]] and the [[Glorious Revolution]].\n\nMilton died of kidney failure on 8 November 1674 and was buried in the church of [[St Giles-without-Cripplegate]], [[Fore Street, London|Fore Street]], London.<ref name=EncylLon>{{cite book|author1=[[Christopher Hibbert|Hibbert, Christopher]]; Ben Weinreb; John Keay; Julia Keay.|title=The London Encyclopaedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xa0D0PqiwfEC&pg=PA762|year=2010|location=London|publisher=Pan Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-73878-2|page=762}}</ref> According to an early biographer, his funeral was attended by \"his learned and great Friends in London, not without a friendly concourse of the Vulgar.\"<ref>Toland 1932 p. 193.</ref> A monument was added in 1793, sculpted by [[John Bacon (sculptor, born 1740)|John Bacon the Elder]].\n\n===Family===\nMilton and his first wife Mary Powell (1625\u20131652) had four children:\n*Anne (born 7 July 1646)\n*Mary (born 25 October 1648)\n*John (16 March 1651 \u2013 June 1652)\n*Deborah (2 May 1652 \u2013 10 August 1727<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Monthly Mirror: Reflecting Men and Manners|publisher=Harding & Wright|year=1810|location=Edinburgh|pages=49|quote=|via=Google Books}}</ref>)\n\nMary Powell died on 5 May 1652 from complications following Deborah's birth.

The marriage took place at [[St Mary Aldermary]] in the City of London. Despite a 31-year age gap, the marriage seemed happy, according to [[John Aubrey]], and lasted more than 12 years until Milton's death. (A plaque on the wall of Mynshull's House in Manchester describes Elizabeth as Milton's \"3rd and Best wife\".) Samuel Johnson, however, claims that Mynshull was \"a domestic companion and attendant\" and that Milton's nephew [[Edward Phillips]] relates that Mynshull \"oppressed his children in his lifetime, and cheated them at his death\".<ref>Johnson 1826 Vol. I 86.</ref>\n\nHis nephews, [[Edward Phillips|Edward]] and [[John Phillips (author)|John Phillips]] (sons of Milton's sister Anne), were educated by Milton and became writers themselves. John acted as a secretary, and Edward was Milton's first biographer.\n\n==Poetry==\nMilton's poetry was slow to see the light of day, at least under his name. His first published poem was \"On Shakespeare\" (1630), anonymously included in the [[Second Folio]] edition of [[William Shakespeare]]'s plays in 1632. An annoted copy of the [[First Folio]] has been suggested to contain marginal notes by Milton.<ref>Flood, Alison,  ''[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/16/when-milton-met-shakespeare-poets-notes-on-bard-appear-to-have-been-found?

The anonymous edition of ''Comus'' was published in 1637, and the publication of ''Lycidas'' in 1638 in ''Justa Edouardo King Naufrago'' was signed J. M. Otherwise.

Both of these works also reflect Milton's post-Restoration political situation. Just before his death in 1674, Milton supervised a second edition of ''Paradise Lost'', accompanied by an explanation of \"why the poem rhymes not\", and prefatory verses by [[Andrew Marvell]]. In 1673, Milton republished his ''1645 Poems'', as well as a collection of his letters and the Latin prolusions from his Cambridge days.\n\n==Views==\nAn unfinished religious manifesto, ''[[De Doctrina Christiana (Milton)|De doctrina christiana]]'', probably written by Milton, lays out many of his heterodox theological views, and was not discovered and published until 1823. Milton's key beliefs were idiosyncratic, not those of an identifiable group or faction, and often they go well beyond the orthodoxy of the time. Their tone, however, stemmed from the Puritan emphasis on the centrality and inviolability of conscience.<ref>See, for instance, Barker, Arthur. ''Milton and the Puritan Dilemma, 1641\u20131660''.

According to Fallon, Milton's monism is most notably reflected in ''Paradise Lost'' when he has angels eat (5.433\u201339){{clarify|date=May 2012}} and apparently engage in sexual intercourse (8.622\u201329){{clarify|date=May 2012}} and the ''De Doctrina'', where he denies the dual natures of man and argues for a theory of Creation [[Ex nihilo|''ex Deo'']].\n\n===Political thought===\n{{Main|John Milton's politics}}Milton was a \"passionately individual Christian Humanist poet.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=A Critical History of English Literature, Vol. I|last=Daiches|first=David|publisher=Seeker & Warburg|year=1960|isbn=|location=London|pages=457}}</ref> He appears on the pages of seventeenth century English Puritanism, an age characterized as \"the world turned upside down.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The world turned upside down : radical ideas during the English revolution|last=Hill|first=Christopher|publisher=Penguin|year=1984|isbn=9780140137323|location=London|pages=}}</ref> He is a Puritan and yet is unwilling to surrender conscience to party positions on public policy.

In both the cases, he seems in control, taking stock of the situation arising from the polarization of the English society on religious and political lines.

After his divorce writings, ''Areopagitica'', and a gap, he wrote in 1649\u201354 in the aftermath of the [[execution of Charles I]], and in polemic justification of the regicide and the existing Parliamentarian regime. Then in 1659\u201360 he foresaw the Restoration, and wrote to head it off.<ref>Blair Worden, ''Literature and Politics in Cromwellian England: John Milton, Andrew Marvell and Marchamont Nedham'' (2007), p. 154.</ref>\n\nMilton's own beliefs were in some cases both unpopular and dangerous, and this was true particularly to his commitment to [[republicanism]].

John Milton wrestled with the great doctrines of the Church amidst the theological crosswinds of his age. The great Poet was undoubtedly Reformed (though his grandfather, Richard \"the Ranger\" Milton had been Roman Catholic).<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=The Arms of the Family: The Significance of John Milton's Relatives and Associates|last=Shawcross|first=John T.|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|year=2004|isbn=978-0813122915|location=Lexington|pages=7}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=In the Days of Milton|last=Jenks|first=Tudor|publisher=A.S.

Like many [[Renaissance]] artists before him, Milton attempted to integrate Christian theology with classical modes. In his early poems, the poet narrator expresses a tension between vice and virtue, the latter invariably related to Protestantism. In ''Comus'', Milton may make ironic use of the [[Charles I of England|Caroline]] court [[masque]] by elevating notions of purity and virtue over the conventions of court revelry and superstition. In his later poems, Milton's theological concerns become more explicit.\n\nHis use of biblical citation was wide-ranging; Harris Fletcher, standing at the beginning of the intensification of the study of the use of scripture in Milton's work (poetry and prose, in all languages Milton mastered), notes that typically Milton clipped and adapted biblical quotations to suit the purpose, giving precise chapter and verse only in texts for a more specialized readership. As for the plenitude of Milton's quotations from scripture, Fletcher comments, \"For this work, I have in all actually collated about twenty-five hundred of the five to ten thousand direct Biblical quotations which appear therein\".<ref name=harris/> Milton's customary English Bible was the [[King James Version#Authorized Version|Authorized King James]].<ref>{{cite journal|first=E.

He has been accused of rejecting the [[Trinity]], believing instead that the Son was subordinate to the Father, a position known as [[Arianism]]; and his sympathy or curiosity was probably engaged by [[Socinianism]]: in August 1650 he licensed for publication by [[William Dugard]] the ''[[Racovian Catechism]]'', based on a non-trinitarian creed.<ref>Lewalski, ''Life of Milton'', p. 253.</ref><ref>William Bridges Hunter, ''A Milton Encyclopedia'' (1980), Vol. VIII, p. 13.</ref> Milton's alleged Arianism, like much of his theology, is still subject of debate and controversy. [[Rufus Wilmot Griswold]] argued that \"In none of his great works is there a passage from which it can be inferred that he was an Arian; and in the very last of his writings he declares that \"the doctrine of the Trinity is a plain doctrine in Scripture.\"<ref>John Milton, The Prose Works of John Milton: With a Biographical Introduction by Rufus Wilmot Griswold. In Two Volumes (Philadelphia: John W. Moore, 1847). Vol. 1. [[wikisource:The Prose Works of John Milton/Biographical introduction|The Prose Works of John Milton, Biographical introduction]]</ref> In ''Areopagitica,'' Milton classified Arians and Socinians as \"errorists\" and \"schismatics\" alongside [[Arminians]] and [[Anabaptists]].<ref>W.F. Draper, \"The Religious Life and Opinions of John Milton.\" In \"The Bibliotheca Sacra and Biblical Repository,\" Volume 17 (1860) p. 38.</ref> A source has interpreted him as broadly Protestant, if not always easy to locate in a more precise religious category.\n\nIn his 1641 treatise, ''[[Of Reformation]]'', Milton expressed his dislike for Catholicism and episcopacy, presenting Rome as a modern [[Babylon]], and bishops as Egyptian taskmasters. These analogies conform to Milton's puritanical preference for [[Old Testament]] imagery. He knew at least four commentaries on ''Genesis'': those of [[John Calvin]], [[Paulus Fagius]], [[David Pareus]] and [[Andreus Rivetus]].<ref>Arnold Williams, ''Renaissance Commentaries on \"Genesis\" and Some Elements of the Theology of Paradise Lost'', PMLA, Vol. 56, No. 1 (Mar. 1941), pp. 151\u201364.</ref>\n\nThrough the [[Interregnum (1649\u20131660)|Interregnum]], Milton often presents England, rescued from the trappings of a worldly monarchy, as an [[elect]] nation akin to the Old Testament [[Israel]], and shows its leader, [[Oliver Cromwell]], as a latter-day [[Moses]]. These views were bound up in Protestant views of the [[Millennium]], which some sects, such as the [[Fifth Monarchists]] predicted would arrive in England. Milton, however, would later criticise the \"worldly\" millenarian views of these and others, and expressed orthodox ideas on the prophecy of the [[Four Empires]].<ref>Walter S. H. Lim, ''John Milton, Radical Politics, and Biblical Republicanism'' (2006), p. 141.</ref>\n\nThe Restoration of the Stuart monarchy in 1660 began a new phase in Milton's work. In ''Paradise Lost'', ''[[Paradise Regained]]'' and ''[[Samson Agonistes]]'', Milton mourns the end of the godly [[English Commonwealth|Commonwealth]]. The [[Garden of Eden]] may allegorically reflect Milton's view of England's recent [[The Fall of Man|Fall from Grace]], while [[Samson]]'s blindness and captivity\u2014mirroring Milton's own lost sight\u2014may be a metaphor for England's blind acceptance of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] as king.\nIllustrated by ''Paradise Lost'' is [[Soul sleep|mortalism]], the belief that the soul lies dormant after the body dies.<ref>John Rogers, ''The Matter of Revolution'' (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1998), p. xi.</ref>\n\nDespite the Restoration of the monarchy, Milton did not lose his personal faith; Samson shows how the loss of national [[salvation]] did not necessarily preclude the salvation of the individual, while ''Paradise Regained'' expresses Milton's continuing belief in the promise of Christian salvation through Jesus Christ.\n\nThough he maintained his personal faith in spite of the defeats suffered by his cause, the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' recounted how he had been alienated from the Church of England by Archbishop William Laud, and then moved similarly from the [[Dissenters]] by their denunciation of religious tolerance in England.\n\n{{quote|Milton had come to stand apart from all sects, though apparently finding the [[Quakers]] most congenial.

In August of that year, he presented his thoughts to the [[Westminster Assembly of Divines]], which had been created by the [[Long Parliament]] to bring greater reform to the Church of England. The Assembly convened on 1 July against the will of King Charles I.\n\nMilton's thinking on divorce caused him considerable trouble with the authorities. An orthodox Presbyterian view of the time was that Milton's views on divorce constituted a one-man [[heresy]]:\n\n{{quote|The fervently Presbyterian [[Thomas Edwards (heresiographer)|Edwards]] had included Milton's divorce tracts in his list in ''[[Gangraena]]'' of heretical publications that threatened the religious and moral fabric of the nation; Milton responded by mocking him as \"shallow Edwards\" in the satirical sonnet \"On the New Forcers of Conscience under the Long Parliament\", usually dated to the latter half of 1646.<ref>[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/119394388/PDFSTART (PDF) Nicholas McDowell, ''Family Politics; Or, How John Phillips Read His Uncle's Satirical Sonnets'', Milton Quarterly Vol. 42 Issue 1, pp. 1\u201321.

However, Milton's basic approval of divorce within strict parameters set by the biblical witness was typical of many influential Christian intellectuals, particularly the Westminster divines. Milton addressed the Assembly on the matter of divorce in August 1643,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~milton/reading_room/ddd/book_1/notes.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=10 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704170506/http://www.dartmouth.edu/~milton/reading_room/ddd/book_1/notes.shtml |archivedate= 4 July 2013 }}</ref> at a moment when the Assembly was beginning to form its opinion on the matter. In the Doctrine & Discipline of Divorce, Milton argued that divorce was a private matter, not a legal or ecclesiastical one. Neither the Assembly nor Parliament condemned Milton or his ideas. In fact, when the Westminster Assembly wrote the Westminster Confession of Faith they allowed for divorce ('Of Marriage and Divorce,' Chapter 24, Section 5) in cases of infidelity or abandonment. Thus, the Christian community, at least a majority within the 'Puritan' sub-set, approved of Milton's views.\n\nNevertheless, reaction among Puritans to Milton's views on divorce was mixed. [[Herbert Palmer (Puritan)|Herbert Palmer]], a member of the [[Westminster Assembly]], condemned Milton in the strongest possible language:\n\n{{quote|If any plead Conscience ... for divorce for other causes than Christ and His Apostles mention; Of which a wicked booke is abroad and uncensured, though deserving to be burnt, whose Author, hath been so impudent as to set his Name to it, and dedicate it to your selves ... will you grant a Toleration for all this?|The Glasse of God's Providence Towards His Faithfull Ones, 1644, p. 54.<ref>Ernest Sirluck, \"Introduction\", Complete Prose Works of John Milton, New Haven: Yale U.

He cast a formidable shadow over English poetry in the 18th and 19th centuries; he was often judged equal or superior to all other English poets, including [[Shakespeare]].

A subsequent prose translation by [[Johann Jakob Bodmer]] was very popular; it influenced Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock. The German-language Milton tradition returned to England in the person of the artist [[Henry Fuseli]].\n\nMany enlightenment thinkers of the 18th century revered and commented on Milton's poetry and non-poetical works. In addition to John Dryden, among them were [[Alexander Pope]], [[Joseph Addison]], [[Thomas Newton]], and [[Samuel Johnson]]. For example, in ''[[The Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]]'',<ref>Nos 267, 273, 279, 285, 291, 297, 303, 309, 315, 321, 327, 333, 339, 345, 351, 357, 363, and 369.</ref> Joseph Addison wrote extensive notes, annotations, and interpretations of certain passages of ''Paradise Lost''. [[Jonathan Richardson (painter)|Jonathan Richardson, senior]], and Jonathan Richardson, the younger, co-wrote a book of criticism.<ref>''Explanatory Notes and Remarks on Milton's Paradise Lost'' (1734).</ref> In 1749, Thomas Newton published an extensive edition of Milton's poetical works with annotations provided by himself, Dryden, Pope, Addison, the Richardsons (father and son) and others. Newton's edition of Milton was a culmination of the honour bestowed upon Milton by early Enlightenment thinkers; it may also have been prompted by Richard Bentley's infamous edition, described above. Samuel Johnson wrote numerous essays on ''Paradise Lost'', and Milton was included in his ''[[Lives of the Most Eminent English Poets]]'' (1779\u20131781). In ''[[The Age of Louis XIV]]'', [[Voltaire]] said \"Milton remains the glory and the wonder (''l'admiration'') of England.\"<ref>Voltaire, ''Le Siecle de Louis XIV 2,'' Paris: Garnier-Flammarion, 1966, p.66.</ref>\n\n===Blake===\n[[File:Milton a Poem copy D 1818 Library of Congress object 1.jpg|thumb|[[Frontispiece (book)|Frontispiece]] to ''[[Milton: A Poem in Two Books]]'']]\n\n[[William Blake]] considered Milton the major English poet.

At the time, poetic blank verse was considered distinct from its use in verse drama, and ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' was taken as a unique examplar.<ref>Saintsbury 1908 ii. 443.</ref> Said [[Isaac Watts]] in 1734, \"Mr. Milton is esteemed the parent and author of blank verse among us\".<ref>Watts 1810 iv. 619.</ref> \"Miltonic verse\" might be synonymous for a century with blank verse as poetry, a new poetic terrain independent from both the drama and the [[heroic couplet]].\n\nLack of rhyme was sometimes taken as Milton's defining innovation. He himself considered the rhymeless quality of ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' to be an extension of his own personal liberty:\n\n{{quote|This neglect then of Rhime&nbsp;... is to be esteem'd an example set, the first in English, of ancient liberty recover'd to heroic Poem from the troublesom and modern bondage of Rimeing.<ref>Milton 1668 xi.</ref>}}\n\nThis pursuit of freedom was largely a reaction against conservative values entrenched within the rigid heroic couplet.<ref>Gordon 2008 p. 234.</ref> Within a dominant culture that stressed elegance and finish, he granted primacy to freedom, breadth and imaginative suggestiveness, eventually developed into the romantic vision of sublime terror. Reaction to Milton's poetic worldview included, grudgingly, acknowledgement that of poet's resemblance to classical writers (Greek and Roman poetry being unrhymed). Blank verse came to be a recognised medium for religious works and for translations of the classics. Unrhymed lyrics like [[William Collins (poet)|Collins]]' ''[[Ode to Evening]]'' (in the meter of Milton's translation of [[Horace]]'s ''[[Ode to Pyrrha]]'') were not uncommon after 1740.<ref>Dexter 1922 p. 46.</ref>\n\nA second aspect of Milton's blank verse was the use of unconventional rhythm:\n\n{{quote|His blank-verse paragraph, and his audacious and victorious attempt to combine blank and rhymed verse with paragraphic effect in Lycidas, lay down indestructible models and patterns of English verse-rhythm, as distinguished from the narrower and more strait-laced forms of English metre.<ref>Saintsbury 1908 ii. 457.</ref>}}\n\nBefore Milton, \"the sense of regular rhythm&nbsp;... had been knocked into the English head so securely that it was part of their nature\".<ref>Saintsbury 1916 p. 101.</ref> The \"Heroick measure\", according to [[Samuel Johnson]], \"is pure&nbsp;... when the accent rests upon every second syllable through the whole line&nbsp;... The repetition of this sound or percussion at equal times, is the most complete harmony of which a single verse is capable\".<ref>Johnson 1751 no. 86.</ref> [[Caesura]]l pauses, most agreed, were best placed at the middle and the end of the line. In order to support this symmetry, lines were most often octo- or deca-syllabic, with no [[enjambed]] endings. To this schema Milton introduced modifications, which included [[hypermetric]]al [[syllable]]s (trisyllabic [[Foot (prosody)|feet]]), [[inversion (prosody)|inversion]] or slighting of [[stress (linguistics)|stresses]], and the shifting of pauses to all parts of the line.<ref>Dexter 1922 p. 57.</ref> Milton deemed these features to be reflective of \"the transcendental union of order and freedom\".<ref>Saintsbury 1908 ii. 458\u201359.</ref> Admirers remained hesitant to adopt such departures from traditional metrical schemes: \"The English&nbsp;... had been writing separate lines for so long that they could not rid themselves of the habit\".<ref>Dexter 1922 p. 59.</ref> Isaac Watts preferred his lines distinct from each other, as did [[Oliver Goldsmith]], [[Henry Pemberton]], and [[Scott of Amwell]], whose general opinion it was that Milton's frequent omission of the initial unaccented foot was \"displeasing to a nice ear\".<ref>Saintsbury 1916 p. 114.</ref> It was not until the late 18th century that poets (beginning with [[Thomas Gray|Gray]]) began to appreciate \"the composition of Milton's harmony&nbsp;... how he loved to vary his pauses, his measures, and his feet, which gives that enchanting air of freedom and wilderness to his versification\".<ref>Gray 1748 ''Observations on English Metre''.</ref> By the 20th century, American poet and critic John Hollander would go so far as to say that Milton \"was able, by plying that most remarkable instrument of English meter ... to invent a new mode of image-making in English poetry.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/visionresonancet0000holl/page/116|title=Vision and resonance : two senses of poetic form|last=Hollander|first=John|date=1975|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=0-19-501898-2|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/visionresonancet0000holl/page/116 116]|oclc=1530446}}</ref>\n\n[[File:St Giles-without-Cripplegate, London 01.JPG|thumb|Memorial in [[St Giles-without-Cripplegate]], London]]\n\nWhile [[neoclassicism|neo-classical]] diction was as restrictive as its [[prosody (poetry)|prosody]], and narrow imagery paired with uniformity of sentence structure resulted in a small set of 800 nouns circumscribing the vocabulary of 90% of heroic couplets ever written up to the eighteenth century,<ref>Hobsbaum 1996 p. 40.</ref> and tradition required that the same adjectives attach to the same nouns, followed by the same verbs, Milton's pursuit of liberty extended into his vocabulary as well.

In 1740, [[Francis Peck]] identified some examples of Milton's \"old\" words (now popular).<ref>They included \"self-same\", \"hue\", \"minstrelsy\", \"murky\", \"carol\", and \"chaunt\".

Milton also wrote the hymn [[Let us with a gladsome mind]], a versification of Psalm 136. His 'L'Allegro' and 'Il Penseroso', with additional material, were magnificently set by Handel (1740).\n\n==Works==\n{{more citations needed section|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Poetry and drama===\n<!-- Years link to \"[years] in poetry\" for poetry, \"[years] in literature\" for drama: -->\n*1629: ''[[On the Morning of Christ's Nativity]]''\n*1630: ''[[On Shakespeare]]''\n*1631: ''[[On Arriving at the Age of Twenty-Three]]''\n*1632: ''[[L'Allegro]]''\n*1632: ''[[Il Penseroso]]''\n*1634: ''[[A Mask Presented at Ludlow Castle, 1634]]'', commonly known as ''[[Comus (John Milton)|Comus]]'' (a [[masque]])\n*1637: ''[[Lycidas]]''\n*1645: ''[[Milton's 1645 Poems|Poems of Mr John Milton, Both English and Latin]]''\n*1652: ''[[When I Consider How My Light is Spent]]'' (Commonly referred to as \"On his blindness\", though Milton did not use this title){{Efn|\"When I consider how my light is spent\" is one of the best known of Milton's sonnets.

The [[Fire department|fire service]], also known in some countries as the fire brigade or [[fire department]], is one of the three main [[emergency service]]s. From [[urban area]]s to aboard [[ship]]s, firefighters have become ubiquitous around the world.\n\nThe skills required for safe operations are regularly practiced during training evaluations throughout a firefighter's career. Initial firefighting skills are normally taught through local, regional or state-approved fire academies or training courses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://publicsafetyelite.com/fire-academy/|title=Fire Academy|website=Public Safety Elite|access-date=2016-03-10}}</ref> Depending on the requirements of a department, additional skills and certifications such as technical rescue and pre-hospital medicine may also be acquired at this time.\n\nFirefighters work closely with other emergency response agencies such as the [[police]] and [[emergency medical service]]. A firefighter's role may overlap with both. [[Fire investigation|Fire investigators]] or [[fire marshal]]s investigate the cause of a fire. If the fire was caused by [[arson]] or [[negligence]], their work will overlap with law enforcement. Firefighters also frequently provide some degree of [[emergency medical service]], in addition to working with full-time [[paramedic]]s.\n\nThe basic tasks of firefighters include: fire suppression, rescue, fire prevention, basic first aid, and investigations. Firefighting is further broken down into skills which include: size-up, extinguishing, ventilation, search and rescue, salvage, containment, mop up and overhaul.\n\n==Duties==\n===Fire suppression===\n[[Image:Fire inside an abandoned convent in Massueville, Quebec, Canada.jpg|thumb|Firefighters had to focus their efforts on saving the adjacent church instead of this burning building, an abandoned convent in Massueville, Quebec, Canada]]\n[[File:Firefighter ladder slide.jpg|thumb|Firefighter carrying out a ladder slide]]\nA fire burns due to the presence of three elements: [[fuel]], [[oxygen]] and heat. This is often referred to as the ''[[fire triangle]]''. Sometimes it is known as the ''[[fire tetrahedron]]'' if a fourth element is added: a chemical chain reaction which can help sustain certain types of fire. The aim of firefighting is to deprive the fire of at least one of those elements. Most commonly this is done by dousing the fire with water, though some fires require other methods such as foam or dry agents. Firefighters are equipped with a wide variety of equipment for this purpose that include: ladder trucks, pumper trucks, tanker trucks, fire hose, and [[fire extinguisher]]s.\n\n==== Structural firefighting ====\n:''See also [[:Category:Fire suppression|Fire suppression]] for other techniques.''\nWhile sometimes fires can be limited to small areas of a structure, wider collateral damage due to smoke, water and burning embers is common. Utility shutoff (such as gas and electricity) is typically an early priority for arriving fire crews. Specific procedures and equipment are needed at a property where hazardous materials are being used or stored.\n\n[[Structure fire]]s may be attacked with either \"interior\" or \"exterior\" resources, or both. Interior crews, using the \"[[two in, two out]]\" rule, may extend [[fire hose]] lines inside the building, find the fire and cool it with water. Exterior crews may direct water into windows and other openings, or against any nearby [[fuel]]s exposed to the initial fire. Hose streams directed into the interior through exterior wall apertures may conflict and jeopardize interior fire attack crews.\n\nBuildings that are made of flammable materials such as wood are different from building materials such as concrete. Generally, a \"fire-resistant\" building is designed to limit fire to a small area or floor. Other floors can be safe by preventing smoke inhalation and damage. All buildings suspected or on fire must be evacuated, regardless of fire rating.\n\nSome fire fighting tactics may appear to be destructive, but often serve specific needs. For example, during [[Ventilation (firefighting)|ventilation]] firefighters are forced to either open holes in the roof or floors of a structure (called vertical ventilation), or open windows and walls (called horizontal ventilation) to remove smoke and heated gases from the interior of the structure. Such ventilation methods are also used to improve interior visibility to locate victims more quickly. Ventilation helps to preserve the life of trapped or unconscious individuals as it releases the poisonous gases from inside the structure. Vertical ventilation is vital to firefighter safety in the event of a [[flashover]] or [[backdraft]] scenario. Releasing the flammable gases through the roof eliminates the possibility of a backdraft, and the removal of heat can reduce the possibility of a flashover. Flashovers, due to their intense heat (900\u20131200\u00b0 Fahrenheit) and explosive temperaments, are commonly fatal to firefighter personnel. Precautionary methods, such as smashing a window, reveal backdraft situations before the firefighter enters the structure and is met with the circumstance head-on. Firefighter safety is the number one priority.\n\nWhenever possible during a structural fire or flooding situation, property is moved into the middle of a room and covered with a salvage cover, a heavy cloth-like tarp. Various steps such as retrieving and protecting valuables found during suppression or overhaul, evacuating water, and boarding windows and roofs can divert or prevent post-fire runoff.\n\n====Wildland firefighting====\n{{Main|Wildfire suppression}}\n[[Wildfire]]s (known in Australia as [[Bushfires in Australia|bushfires]]) require a unique set of strategies and tactics. In many countries such as Australia and the United States, these duties are mostly carried out by local [[Volunteer fire department|volunteer firefighters]]. Wildfires have some ecological role in allowing new plants to grow, therefore in some cases they will be left to burn.<ref>{{citation|title=Forest Fire in Canada|date=2008-06-05|url=http://fire.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/questions-eng.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530143903/http://fire.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/questions-eng.php|url-status=dead|publisher=Natural Resources Canada|accessdate=2009-05-01|archivedate=2009-05-30}}</ref> Priorities in fighting wildfires include preventing the loss of life and property.\n\n=== Rescue ===\n[[File:Extrication exercise (1).jpg|thumb|right|200px|A demonstration of a [[vehicle extrication]].]]\nFirefighters rescue people (and animals) from dangerous situations such as [[traffic collision|crashed vehicles]], [[Structural integrity and failure|structural collapses]], trench collapses, cave and tunnel emergencies, water and ice emergencies, elevator emergencies, energized electrical line emergencies, and industrial accidents.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.prospects.ac.uk/job-profiles/firefighter|title=Firefighter job profile|publisher=Prospects.ac.uk}}</ref> In less common circumstances, Firefighters rescue victims from hazardous materials emergencies as well as steep cliffs, embankment and high rises - The latter is referred to as High Angle Rescue, or [[Rope rescue|Rope Rescue]]. Many fire departments, including most in the [[United Kingdom]], refer to themselves as a '''fire and rescue service''' for this reason. Large fire departments, such as the [[New York City Fire Department]] and [[London Fire Brigade]], have specialist teams for advanced technical rescue. As building fires have been in decline for many years in developed countries such as the [[United States]], rescues other than fires make up an increasing proportion of their firefighters' work.<ref name=\"Plenty\"/>\n\n===Emergency medical services===\nFirefighters frequently provide some degree of [[Emergency medicine|emergency medical care]]. In some jurisdictions [[first aid]] is the only medical training that firefighters have, and medical-only calls are the sole responsibility of a separate [[emergency medical services]] (EMS) agency. Elsewhere, it is common for firefighters to respond to medical-only calls. The impetus for this is the growing demand for emergency medicine and the decline of fires and traditional firefighting call-outs<ref name=\"Plenty\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2013/09/07/plenty-firefighters-but-where-are-fires/isCPrIPauX078UKHdixu0K/story.html|title=Plenty of firefighters, but where are the fires?|date=2013-09-07|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|accessdate=2017-09-22}}</ref>\u2014though fire departments still have to be able to respond to them\u2014and their existing ability to respond rapidly to emergencies.

In those departments, firefighters are often jointly trained as [[emergency medical technician]]s in order to deliver [[basic life support]], and more rarely as [[paramedics]] to deliver [[advanced life support]]. In the United Kingdom, where fire services and EMS are run separately, [[Fire Service Co-Responder|fire service co-responding]] has been introduced more recently.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/news/LatestNewsReleases_brigade-and-london-ambulance-service-team-up-for-life-saving-trial.asp#.WIpXBH2DEfI|title=News|website=www.london-fire.gov.uk|accessdate=5 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170813185751/http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/news/LatestNewsReleases_brigade-and-london-ambulance-service-team-up-for-life-saving-trial.asp#.WIpXBH2DEfI|archivedate=13 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Another point of variation is whether the firefighters respond in a fire engine or a [[Nontransporting EMS vehicle|response car]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/surrey-news/surrey-firefighters-called-300-medical-11295803|title=Surrey firefighters called to almost 300 medical emergencies during co-responding trial|publisher=[[Surrey Advertiser]]|date=9 May 2016|accessdate=3 September 2018}}</ref> Either way, separate employees to crew [[ambulance]]s are still needed, unless the firefighters can work shifts on the ambulances.\n\n===Specialized roles===\n====Aircraft rescue & firefighting====\n{{Main|Aircraft rescue and firefighting}}\n[[Airport]]s employ specialist firefighters to deal with potential ground emergencies. Due to the mass casualty potential of an aviation emergency, the speed with which emergency response equipment and personnel arrive at the scene of the emergency is of paramount importance. When dealing with an emergency, the airport firefighters are tasked with rapidly securing the aircraft, its crew and its passengers from all hazards, particularly fire. Airport firefighters have advanced training in the application of firefighting foams, dry chemical and clean agents used to extinguish burning aviation fuel.\n\n====Hazardous materials====\n[[File:Decontamination after incident at Archway - geograph.org.uk - 108750.jpg|thumb|[[Decontamination]] after a chemical spill]]\nFire departments are usually the primary agency that responds to an emergency involving [[hazardous material]]s. Specialized firefighters, known as hazardous materials technicians, have training and certification in chemical identification, leak control, decontamination, and clean-up procedures.\n\n===Fire prevention===\n[[File:FiremanPaffandElmo.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Firefighters frequently give fire prevention talks at schools and community events]]\n\nFire departments frequently provide advice to the public on how to prevent fires in the home and work-place environments.

This is normally accomplished in many innovative ways such as conducting presentations, distributing safety brochures, providing news articles, writing [[public safety announcement]]s (PSA) or establishing meaningful displays in well-visited areas. Ensuring that each household has working [[smoke alarm]]s, is educated in the proper techniques of fire safety, has an evacuation route and rendezvous point is of top priority in [[public education]] for most fire prevention teams in almost all fire department localities.\n\nFire investigators, who are experienced firefighters trained in fire cause determinism, are dispatched to fire scenes, in order to investigate and determine whether the fire was a result of an accident or intentional. Some fire investigators have full law enforcement powers to investigate and arrest suspected arsonists.\n\n==Occupational health and safety==\n===Direct risks===\n====Fires====\n[[File:Firemen's Monument, Boston by John A Wilson- far.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Firemen's Memorial (Boston)]] by [[John A. Wilson (sculptor)|John Wilson]]]]\n[[Image:Airport-firefighters-drill.jpg|thumb|right|Firefighters wearing [[Personal protective equipment|PPE]] tackle an aircraft fire during a drill at [[Dyess Air Force Base]] in [[Abilene, Texas]]]]\nTo allow protection from the inherent risks of fighting fires, firefighters wear and carry protective and self-rescue equipment at all times. A [[self-contained breathing apparatus]] (SCBA) delivers air to the firefighter through a [[full face mask]] and is worn to protect against [[smoke inhalation]], toxic fumes, and super heated gases. A special device called a [[PASS device|Personal Alert Safety System]] (PASS) is commonly worn independently or as a part of the SCBA to alert others when a firefighter stops moving for a specified period of time or manually operates the device. The PASS device sounds an alarm that can assist another firefighter ([[firefighter assist and search team]] (FAST), or [[rapid intervention team]] (RIT), in locating the firefighter in distress.\n\nFirefighters often carry personal self-rescue [[rope]]s. The ropes are generally 30 feet long and can provide a firefighter (that has enough time to deploy the rope) a partially controlled exit out of an elevated window. Lack of a personal rescue rope is cited in the deaths of two New York City Firefighters, Lt. John Bellew and Lt. Curtis Meyran, who died after they jumped from the fourth floor of a burning apartment building in the Bronx. Of the four firefighters who jumped and survived, only one of them had a self-rescue rope. Since the incident, the Fire Department of New York City has issued self-rescue ropes to their firefighters.<ref name=NYT>{{cite news |author=James Barron |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/24/nyregion/3-firefighters-die-in-blazes-in-brooklyn-and-bronx.html |title=3 Firefighters Die in Blazes in Brooklyn and Bronx |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 24, 2005 }}</ref>\n\n[[Hyperthermia|Heat injury]] is a major issue for firefighters as they wear insulated clothing and cannot shed the heat generated from physical exertion. Early detection of heat issues is critical to stop dehydration and heat stress becoming fatal. Early onset of heat stress affects cognitive function which combined with operating in dangerous environment makes heat stress and dehydration a critical issue to monitor. Firefighter physiological status monitoring is showing promise in alerting EMS and commanders to the status of their people on the fire ground. Devices such as [[PASS device]] alert 10\u201320 seconds after a firefighter has stopped moving in a structure. Physiological status monitors measure a firefighter's vital sign status, fatigue and exertion levels and transmit this information over their voice radio. This technology allows a degree of early warning to physiological stress. These devices<ref>Zephyr Technologies [http://www.zephyr-technology.com/bioharness-bt.html BioHarness BT] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407031009/http://www.zephyr-technology.com/bioharness-bt.html |date=2010-04-07 }}</ref> are similar to technology developed for [[Future Force Warrior]] and give a measure of exertion and fatigue. They also tell the people outside a building when they have stopped moving or fallen. This allows a supervisor to call in additional engines before the crew get exhausted and also gives an early warning to firefighters before they run out of air, as they may not be able to make voice calls over their radio. Current [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] tables exist for heat injury and the allowable amount of work in a given environment based on temperature, humidity and solar loading.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/dts/osta/otm/otm_iii/otm_iii_4.html |title=OSHA Technical Manual (OTM) - Section III: Chapter IV: Heat Stress |publisher=Osha.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-12-10}}</ref>\n\nFirefighters are also at risk for developing [[rhabdomyolysis]]. Rhabdomyolysis is the breakdown of muscle tissue and has many causes including heat exposure, high core body temperature, and prolonged, intense exertion. Routine firefighter tasks, such as carrying extra weight of equipment and working in hot environments, can increase firefighters\u2019 risk for rhabdomyolysis.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2018-05-01|title=What structural fire fighters need to know about rhabdomyolysis.|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2018-133/pdfs/2018-133.pdf?id=10.26616/NIOSHPUB2018133|doi=10.26616/nioshpub2018133}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|date=2018-05-01|title=What wildland fire fighters need to know about rhabdomyolysis.|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2018-131/pdfs/2018-131.pdf?id=10.26616/NIOSHPUB2018131|doi=10.26616/nioshpub2018131}}</ref>\n\n====Structural collapses====\nAnother leading cause of death during firefighting is [[structural collapse]] of a burning building (e.g. a wall, floor, ceiling, roof, or [[truss|truss system]]). Structural collapse, which often occurs without warning, may crush or trap firefighters inside the structure. To avoid loss of life, all on-duty firefighters should maintain two-way communication with the [[incident commander]] and be equipped with a [[PASS device|personal alert safety system device]] on all fire scenes and maintain radio communication on all incidents(PASS).<ref>[[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] Alert: [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/99-146.html Preventing Injuries and Deaths of Fire Fighters due to Structural Collapse].

May 2005.</ref> [[Francis Brannigan]] was the founder and greatest contributor to this element of firefighter safety.\n\n====Traffic collisions====\nIn the United States, 25% of fatalities of firefighters are caused by [[traffic collision]]s while responding to or returning from an incident. Other firefighters have been injured or killed by vehicles at the scene of a fire or emergency (Paulison 2005). A common measure fire departments have taken to prevent this is to require firefighters to wear a bright yellow reflective vest over their turnout coats if they have to work on a public road, to make them more visible to passing drivers.<ref>Federal Highway Administration DOT 23CFR634 Worker Visibility</ref> In addition to the direct dangers of firefighting, cardiovascular diseases account for approximately 45% of on duty firefighter deaths.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The New England Journal of Medicine\", March 22, 2007, Accessed:July 17, 2011 |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=356 |issue=12 |pages=1207\u20131215 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa060357 |pmid=17377158 |year = 2007|last1 = Kales|first1 = Stefanos N.|last2=Soteriades |first2=Elpidoforos S. |last3=Christophi |first3=Costas A. |last4=Christiani |first4=David C. |citeseerx=10.1.1.495.4530 }}</ref>\n\n====Violence====\nFirefighters have sometimes been assaulted by members of the public while responding to calls. These kinds of attacks can cause firefighters to fear for their safety and may cause them to not have full focus on the situation which could result in injury to their selves or the patient.\n\n===Long-term risks===\n====Cardiovascular disease====\nFirefighting has long been associated with poor [[cardiovascular]] outcomes. In the United States, the most common cause of on-duty fatalities for firefighters is sudden cardiac death. In addition to personal factors that may predispose an individual to [[coronary artery disease]] or other [[cardiovascular disease]]s, occupational exposures can significantly increase a firefighter's risk. Historically, the fire service blamed poor firefighter physical condition for being the primary cause of cardiovascular related deaths. However, over the last 20 years, studies and research has indicated the toxic gasses put fire service personnel at significantly higher risk for cardiovascular related conditions and death. For instance, [[carbon monoxide]], present in nearly all fire environments, and [[hydrogen cyanide]], formed during the combustion of paper, cotton, plastics, and other substances containing [[carbon]] and [[nitrogen]]. The substances inside of materials change during combustion their bi-products interfere with the transport of oxygen in the body. [[hypoxia (medical)|Hypoxia]] can then lead to heart injury. In addition, chronic exposure to [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]] in smoke is associated with [[atherosclerosis]]. Noise exposures may contribute to [[hypertension]] and possibly ischemic heart disease. Other factors associated with firefighting, such as [[Stress (medicine)|stress]], [[heat stress]], and heavy physical exertion, also increase the risk of cardiovascular events.<ref>[[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] Alert: [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2007-133 Preventing Fire Fighter Fatalities Due to Heart Attacks and Other Sudden Cardiovascular Events.] July 2007.</ref>\n\nDuring fire suppression activities a firefighter can reach peak or near peak heart rates which can act as a trigger for a cardiac event. For example, [[tachycardia]] can cause plaque buildup to break loose and lodge itself is a small part of the heart causing [[myocardial infarction]], also known as a heart attack. This along with unhealthy habits and lack of exercise can be very hazardous to firefighter health.<ref>[University of Illinois] https://www.fsi.illinois.edu/documents{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} /research/CardioChemRisksModernFF_InterimReport2016.pdf</ref>\n\n====Cancer====\n[[File:Sailors participate in a fire drill exercise aboard USS Bainbridge (DDG 96).

In urban areas, this means that full-time paid firefighters usually have [[shift work]], with some providing cover each night. On the other hand, it may not be practical to employ full-time firefighters in villages and isolated small towns, where their services may not be required for days at a time. For this reason, many fire departments have firefighters who spend long periods on call to respond to infrequent emergencies; they may have regular jobs outside of firefighting. Whether they are paid or not varies by country. In the United States and Germany, [[volunteer fire department]]s provide most of the cover in rural areas. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, by contrast, actual volunteers are rare. Instead, \"[[retained firefighter]]s\" are paid for responding to incidents, along with a small salary for spending long periods of time on call.\n\n==Firefighting around the world==\n{{Further|Firefighting worldwide}}\n[[File:BSPP section Bastille Day 2008.jpg|thumb|The [[Paris Fire Brigade]] is a [[French Army]] unit which serves as the fire service for [[Paris]] and certain sites of national strategic importance.]]\n[[File:mtlfirechiefs.jpg|thumb|250px|Firefighters tackling a blaze in [[Montreal, Canada]]]]\nA key difference between many country's fire services is what the balance is between full-time and volunteer (or on-call) firefighters. In the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]], large metropolitan fire departments are almost entirely made up of full-time firefighters. On the other hand, in [[Germany]] and [[Austria]],<ref>[http://www.bundesfeuerwehrverband.at/oebfv/index.php?id=154 \u00d6sterreichischer Bundesfeuerwehrverband: Statistik des \u00d6BFV<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228111522/http://www.bundesfeuerwehrverband.at/oebfv/index.php?id=154 |date=2008-12-28 }}</ref> volunteers play a substantial role even in the largest fire departments, including Berlin's, which serves a population of 3.6 million. Regardless of how this balance works, a common feature is that smaller urban areas have a mix of full-time and volunteer/on-call firefighters. This is known in the United States as a [[combination fire department]]. In [[Chile]] and [[Peru]], all firefighters are volunteers.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-27186801|title=Chile's firefighters in spotlight after Valparaiso blaze |date=2014-04-29|accessdate=2019-07-17|work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\nAnother point of variation is how the fire services are organized. Some countries like [[Israel]] and [[New Zealand]] have a single national fire service. Others like Australia, the United Kingdom and France organize fire services based on regions or sub-national states. In the United States, Germany and [[Canada]], fire departments are run at a municipal level.\n\nAtypically, [[Singapore]] and many parts of [[Switzerland]] have [[Compulsory Fire Service|fire service conscription]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.swissfire.ch/fileadmin/swissfire/Der%20SFV/Factsheet_Feuerwehr_2015_d.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-08-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180128134257/http://www.swissfire.ch/fileadmin/swissfire/Der%20SFV/Factsheet_Feuerwehr_2015_d.pdf |archive-date=2018-01-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.scdf.gov.sg/content/scdf_internet/en/general/about-us.html |title=SCDF Website - GENERAL: About Us |access-date=2018-08-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161228102845/http://www.scdf.gov.sg/content/scdf_internet/en/general/about-us.html |archive-date=2016-12-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In Germany, conscription can also be used if a village does not have a functioning fire service. Other unusual arrangements are seen in France, where two of the country's fire services (the [[Paris Fire Brigade]] and the [[Marseille Naval Fire Battalion]]) are part of the armed forces, and [[Denmark]], where most fire services are run by private companies.<ref name=\"fe-2008\"/>\n\nAnother way in which a firefighter's work varies around the world is the nature of firefighting equipment and tactics. For example, American fire departments make heavier use of [[Fire engine#Aerial apparatus|aerial appliances]], and are often split between engine and ladder companies. In Europe, where the size and usefulness of aerial appliances are often limited by narrow streets, they are only used for rescues, and firefighters can rotate between working on an engine and an aerial appliance.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fireapparatusmagazine.com/articles/print/volume-21/issue-6/features/fire-apparatus-united-states-vs-europe.html|title=United States vs. Europe|publisher=Fire Apparatus|date=2016-06-07|accessdate=2019-07-17}}</ref><ref name=\"fe-2008\">{{cite web|url=https://www.fireengineering.com/articles/2008/06/fire-commentary-european-firefighting-operations.html|title=Fire Commentary: European Firefighting Operations|publisher=Fire Engineering|date=2008-06-12|accessdate=2019-07-17}}</ref> A final point in variation is how involved firefighters are in [[emergency medical services]].\n\n==Communication and command structure==\n[[Image:NSWFB112.jpg|thumb|[[Fire and Rescue NSW|New South Wales Fire Brigade]] station officer (red helmet) and firefighters (yellow helmets), Australia]]\n\nThe expedient and accurate handling of fire alarms or calls are significant factors in the successful outcome of any incident. Fire department communications play a critical role in that successful outcome. Fire department communications include the methods by which the public can notify the communications center of an emergency, the methods by which the center can notify the proper fire fighting forces, and the methods by which information is exchanged at the scene. One method is to use a [[megaphone]] to communicate.\n\nA telecommunicator (often referred to as a [[000 Operator]]){{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} has a role different from but just as important as other emergency personnel. The telecommunicator must process calls from unknown and unseen individuals, usually calling under stressful conditions. He/she must be able to obtain complete, reliable information from the caller and prioritize requests for assistance. It is the dispatcher's responsibility to bring order to chaos.\n\nWhile some fire departments are large enough to utilize their own telecommunication dispatcher, most rural and small areas rely on a central dispatcher to provide handling of fire, rescue, and police services.\n\nFirefighters are trained to use [[Telecommunication|communications]] equipment to receive alarms, give and receive commands, request assistance, and report on conditions. Since firefighters from different agencies routinely provide mutual aid to each other, and routinely operate at incidents where other emergency services are present, it is essential to have structures in place to establish a unified chain of command, and share information between agencies. The U.S. [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) has established a National Incident Management System.<ref>[http://www.fema.gov/pdf/emergency/nims/NIMS_core.pdf]</ref> One component of this system is the [[Incident Command System]].\n\nAll [[radio communication]] in the United States is under authorization from the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC); as such, fire departments that operate radio equipment must have radio licenses from the FCC.\n\n[[Ten codes]] were popular in the early days of radio equipment because of poor transmission and reception. Advances in modern radio technology have reduced the need for ten-codes and many departments have converted to simple English (clear text).\n\n===Ranks===\nMany firefighters are sworn members with command structures similar to the [[military]] and [[police]]. They do not have general [[Police|police powers]] (some firefighters in the [[United States]] have limited police powers, like [[fire police]] departments, while certain [[fire marshal]]s have full police powers, i.e. the ability to make warrantless arrests, and authority to carry a firearm on and off-duty), but have specific powers of enforcement and control in fire and emergency situations.\n\nThe basic unit of an American fire department is a \"company\", a group of firefighters who typically work on the same engine. A \"crew\" or \"platoon\" is a subdivision of a company who work on the same shift. Commonwealth fire services are more likely to be organized around a \"watch\", who work the same shift on multiple engines.<ref>[http://www.humbersidefire.gov.uk/careers/becoming-a-firefighter/shift-patterns Humberside Fire and Rescue Service: Shift patterns]</ref>\n\n====Australia====\nNew South Wales Rural Fire Service\n\n{| cellpadding=\"5\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Additionally, in the volunteer fire departments, there is a difference between a rank and an official position. This is founded on the military traditions of the fire departments. Every firefighter can hold a high rank without having an official position. A firefighter can be promoted by years of service, training skills and qualifications. Official positions are partly elected or given by capabilities. These conditions allow that older ordinary firefighters have higher ranks than their leaders. But through this ranks are no authorities given ([[Brevet (military)|Brevet]]).\n\n;Professional Fire Fighters (Middle Technical Grades) of [[Rheinland-Pfalz]]\nCompleted vocational training in a technical occupation suitable for the fire service.

It is part of the Ministry of Interior's Department of Firefighters, Public Rescue and Public Protection. The CNVVF task is to provide safety for people, animals and property, and control the compliance of buildings and industries to fire safety rules. The Ministry of the Interior, through the CNVVF, adopts fire safety rules with ministerial decrees or other lower rank documents. The CNVVF also ensures public rescue in emergencies that involves the use of chemical weapons, bacteriological, radiological and materials.

In general, white helmets denote chief officers, while red helmets may denote company officers, but the specific meaning of a helmet's color or style varies from region to region and department to department. The rank of an officer in an American fire department is most commonly denoted by a number of [[speaking trumpet]]s, a reference to a [[megaphone]]-like device used in the early days of the fire service, although typically called \"[[bugle]]\" in today's parlance. Ranks proceed from one (lieutenant) to five (fire chief) bugles. Traditional ranks in American fire departments that exist but may not always be utilized in all cities or towns include:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| '''Firefighter'''\n::no bugles\n| '''Engineer/Technician/Sergeant'''\n::3 chevrons\n| '''Lieutenant'''\n::1 bugle\n|-\n| '''Captain'''\n::2 either traditionally side by side\n::or less usually crossed bugles\n| '''Battalion Chief/District Chief'''\n::2 either side by side\n::or more traditionally crossed bugles\n| '''Division Chief or Assistant /Deputy Asst.'''\n'''Chief/Commissioner'''\n::3 crossed bugles\n|-\n| '''Deputy Chief/Commissioner'''\n::4 crossed bugles\n| '''Chief/Commissioner'''\n::5 crossed bugles\n|\n|}\nIn many fire departments in the U.S., the captain is commonly the commander of a company and a lieutenant is the supervisor of the company's firefighters on shift. There is no state or federal rank structure for firefighters and each municipality or volunteer fire department creates and uses their own unique structure.\n\nStill, some other American fire departments such the FDNY use military rank insignia in addition or instead of the traditional bugles. Additionally, officers on [[Glossary of firefighting#T|truck companies]] have been known to use rank insignias shaped like axes for Lieutenants (1) and Captains (2).\n\n==Firefighter equipment==\n{{Main|Glossary of firefighting equipment}}\n<!-- Before you add anything else to this list, ask yourself \"Do many or most firefighters use this piece of equipment in a way that's notable, verifiable, and of interest to the general audience?\" If not, consider just adding it to the glossary of equipment article instead. -->\n<gallery>\nFile:TurkishFirefighterMOPP4.jpeg|Turkish firefighters in [[MOPP (protective gear)|MOPP]] 4 level protective gear during an exercise held at [[Incirlik Air Base]], [[Turkey]]\nFile:TFS fire equipment.jpg|[[Toronto Fire Services|Toronto firefighters]] prepare their equipment\nFile:03262012Demonstraciones_rescate_erum_fabian_acu\u00f1a137.JPG|A firefighter using a hydraulic cutter during a demonstration\nFile:Aa RN firefighter 01.jpg|[[Royal Navy|British naval men]] in firefighting gear on [[HMS Illustrious (R06)]], [[Liverpool]], 25 October 2009\n</gallery>\nA partial list of some equipment typically used by firefighters:\n* Hand tools, such as\n** Flat-head and pick-head [[axe]]\n** [[Pike pole]]\n** [[Halligan bar]]\n** [[Flashlight]]\n** [[Spanner wrench]]\n** Circular (\"K-12\"), Cutters Edge and chain saws\n** [[Hydraulic rescue tools]] such as spreaders, cutters, and rams\n* [[Personal protective equipment]] (\"PPE\") designed to withstand water and high temperatures, such as\n** [[Bunker gear]], including turnout jacket and pants\n** [[SCBA|Self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA)]]\n** Helmet, face mask and visor; climbing helmets\n** [[Safety boots]], gloves, and [[Nomex]] and Carbon flash hoods\n** [[PASS device|Personal alert safety system (PASS) device]]\n* Handheld radio, pager, or other communication devices\n* [[Thermal imaging camera (firefighting)|Thermal imaging camera]]\n* [[Gas detector]]\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of firefighting}}\n[[Image:Old firefighters.jpg|right|thumb|A picture of American firefighters in the 1770s]]\n[[File:Vancouver firemen responding to a fire alarm.jpg|thumb|Vancouver firemen responding to a fire alarm, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Photograph taken by W.J. Carpenter in 1910.]]\n\nAlthough people have fought fires since there have been valuable things to burn, the first instance of organized professionals combating structural fires occurred in Ancient [[Egypt]]. Likewise, fire fighters of the [[Roman Republic]] existed solely as privately organized and funded groups that operated more similarly to a business than a public service; however, during the [[Principate]] period [[Augustus]] revolutionized firefighting by calling for the creation of a fire guard that was trained, paid, and equipped by the state- the first truly public and professional firefighting service. Known as the [[Vigiles]], they were organised into cohorts and also served as a night watch and city police force.\n\nThe earliest American fire departments were volunteers, including the volunteer fire company in [[New Amsterdam]], now known as [[New York (state)|New York]].<ref>Essentials of Firefighting</ref> Fire companies were composed of citizens who volunteered their time to help protect the community. As time progressed and new towns popped up throughout the region there was a sharp increase in the number of volunteer departments. The first career fire department was not established in the United States until 1853 in Cincinnati, Ohio ([[Cincinnati Fire & EMS Department]]). Many large cities began establishing paid, full-time, staff in order to try facilitate greater fire-related call volume. St. Louis Fire Department followed Cincinnati four years later and became the second established career fire department in the country followed by other large cities like New York ([[FDNY]]). City fire departments draw their funding directly from city taxes and share the same budget as other public works like the police department and trash services. Aside from big city fire departments, many populated suburbs and towns have career fire departments. The primary difference between a municipality department and a City department is the funding. Municipal fire departments do not share their budget with any other service and are considered to be private entities within a jurisdiction. This means that they have their own taxes that feed into their budgeting needs. Another main difference is the structure of the department. City fire departments have the mayor at the top of the chain whereas municipal departments have elected board officials who help maintain and run the department along with the chief officer staff.\n\n==Fundraisers==\nFunds for fire-fighting equipment may be raised by the firefighters themselves, especially in the case of volunteer organizations. Events such as pancake breakfasts and chili feeds are common in the US. Social events are also used to raise money, including dances, community fairs and car washes.\n\n==Notable firefighters==\n{{Globalize|section|datej=December 2012|date=March 2020}}\n* [[James Braidwood (firefighter)]] (1800\u20131861), founder of the municipal fire brigade in Edinburgh, 1824\n* [[John Decker (fire chief)|John Decker]] (1823\u20131892), chief of the New York City department during the 1863 draft riots\n* [[Ra\u00fal G\u00e1ndara-Cartagena]] (1895\u20131989), first and kilongest-serving Puerto Rico commonwealth fire chief\n* [[James J.

The [[Fire department|fire service]], also known in some countries as the fire brigade or [[fire department]], is one of the three main [[emergency service]]s. From [[urban area]]s to aboard [[ship]]s, firefighters have become ubiquitous around the world.\n\nThe skills required for safe operations are regularly practiced during training evaluations throughout a firefighter's career. Initial firefighting skills are normally taught through local, regional or state-approved fire academies or training courses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://publicsafetyelite.com/fire-academy/|title=Fire Academy|website=Public Safety Elite|access-date=2016-03-10}}</ref> Depending on the requirements of a department, additional skills and certifications such as technical rescue and pre-hospital medicine may also be acquired at this time.\n\nFirefighters work closely with other emergency response agencies such as the [[police]] and [[emergency medical service]]. A firefighter's role may overlap with both. [[Fire investigation|Fire investigators]] or [[fire marshal]]s investigate the cause of a fire. If the fire was caused by [[arson]] or [[negligence]], their work will overlap with law enforcement. Firefighters also frequently provide some degree of [[emergency medical service]], in addition to working with full-time [[paramedic]]s.\n\nThe basic tasks of firefighters include: fire suppression, rescue, fire prevention, basic first aid, and investigations. Firefighting is further broken down into skills which include: size-up, extinguishing, ventilation, search and rescue, salvage, containment, mop up and overhaul.\n\n==Duties==\n===Fire suppression===\n[[Image:Fire inside an abandoned convent in Massueville, Quebec, Canada.jpg|thumb|Firefighters had to focus their efforts on saving the adjacent church instead of this burning building, an abandoned convent in Massueville, Quebec, Canada]]\n[[File:Firefighter ladder slide.jpg|thumb|Firefighter carrying out a ladder slide]]\nA fire burns due to the presence of three elements: [[fuel]], [[oxygen]] and heat. This is often referred to as the ''[[fire triangle]]''. Sometimes it is known as the ''[[fire tetrahedron]]'' if a fourth element is added: a chemical chain reaction which can help sustain certain types of fire. The aim of firefighting is to deprive the fire of at least one of those elements. Most commonly this is done by dousing the fire with water, though some fires require other methods such as foam or dry agents. Firefighters are equipped with a wide variety of equipment for this purpose that include: ladder trucks, pumper trucks, tanker trucks, fire hose, and [[fire extinguisher]]s.\n\n==== Structural firefighting ====\n:''See also [[:Category:Fire suppression|Fire suppression]] for other techniques.''\nWhile sometimes fires can be limited to small areas of a structure, wider collateral damage due to smoke, water and burning embers is common. Utility shutoff (such as gas and electricity) is typically an early priority for arriving fire crews. Specific procedures and equipment are needed at a property where hazardous materials are being used or stored.\n\n[[Structure fire]]s may be attacked with either \"interior\" or \"exterior\" resources, or both. Interior crews, using the \"[[two in, two out]]\" rule, may extend [[fire hose]] lines inside the building, find the fire and cool it with water. Exterior crews may direct water into windows and other openings, or against any nearby [[fuel]]s exposed to the initial fire. Hose streams directed into the interior through exterior wall apertures may conflict and jeopardize interior fire attack crews.\n\nBuildings that are made of flammable materials such as wood are different from building materials such as concrete. Generally, a \"fire-resistant\" building is designed to limit fire to a small area or floor. Other floors can be safe by preventing smoke inhalation and damage. All buildings suspected or on fire must be evacuated, regardless of fire rating.\n\nSome fire fighting tactics may appear to be destructive, but often serve specific needs. For example, during [[Ventilation (firefighting)|ventilation]] firefighters are forced to either open holes in the roof or floors of a structure (called vertical ventilation), or open windows and walls (called horizontal ventilation) to remove smoke and heated gases from the interior of the structure. Such ventilation methods are also used to improve interior visibility to locate victims more quickly. Ventilation helps to preserve the life of trapped or unconscious individuals as it releases the poisonous gases from inside the structure. Vertical ventilation is vital to firefighter safety in the event of a [[flashover]] or [[backdraft]] scenario. Releasing the flammable gases through the roof eliminates the possibility of a backdraft, and the removal of heat can reduce the possibility of a flashover. Flashovers, due to their intense heat (900\u20131200\u00b0 Fahrenheit) and explosive temperaments, are commonly fatal to firefighter personnel. Precautionary methods, such as smashing a window, reveal backdraft situations before the firefighter enters the structure and is met with the circumstance head-on. Firefighter safety is the number one priority.\n\nWhenever possible during a structural fire or flooding situation, property is moved into the middle of a room and covered with a salvage cover, a heavy cloth-like tarp. Various steps such as retrieving and protecting valuables found during suppression or overhaul, evacuating water, and boarding windows and roofs can divert or prevent post-fire runoff.\n\n====Wildland firefighting====\n{{Main|Wildfire suppression}}\n[[Wildfire]]s (known in Australia as [[Bushfires in Australia|bushfires]]) require a unique set of strategies and tactics. In many countries such as Australia and the United States, these duties are mostly carried out by local [[Volunteer fire department|volunteer firefighters]]. Wildfires have some ecological role in allowing new plants to grow, therefore in some cases they will be left to burn.<ref>{{citation|title=Forest Fire in Canada|date=2008-06-05|url=http://fire.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/questions-eng.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530143903/http://fire.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/questions-eng.php|url-status=dead|publisher=Natural Resources Canada|accessdate=2009-05-01|archivedate=2009-05-30}}</ref> Priorities in fighting wildfires include preventing the loss of life and property.\n\n=== Rescue ===\n[[File:Extrication exercise (1).jpg|thumb|right|200px|A demonstration of a [[vehicle extrication]].]]\nFirefighters rescue people (and animals) from dangerous situations such as [[traffic collision|crashed vehicles]], [[Structural integrity and failure|structural collapses]], trench collapses, cave and tunnel emergencies, water and ice emergencies, elevator emergencies, energized electrical line emergencies, and industrial accidents.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.prospects.ac.uk/job-profiles/firefighter|title=Firefighter job profile|publisher=Prospects.ac.uk}}</ref> In less common circumstances, Firefighters rescue victims from hazardous materials emergencies as well as steep cliffs, embankment and high rises - The latter is referred to as High Angle Rescue, or [[Rope rescue|Rope Rescue]]. Many fire departments, including most in the [[United Kingdom]], refer to themselves as a '''fire and rescue service''' for this reason. Large fire departments, such as the [[New York City Fire Department]] and [[London Fire Brigade]], have specialist teams for advanced technical rescue. As building fires have been in decline for many years in developed countries such as the [[United States]], rescues other than fires make up an increasing proportion of their firefighters' work.<ref name=\"Plenty\"/>\n\n===Emergency medical services===\nFirefighters frequently provide some degree of [[Emergency medicine|emergency medical care]]. In some jurisdictions [[first aid]] is the only medical training that firefighters have, and medical-only calls are the sole responsibility of a separate [[emergency medical services]] (EMS) agency. Elsewhere, it is common for firefighters to respond to medical-only calls. The impetus for this is the growing demand for emergency medicine and the decline of fires and traditional firefighting call-outs<ref name=\"Plenty\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2013/09/07/plenty-firefighters-but-where-are-fires/isCPrIPauX078UKHdixu0K/story.html|title=Plenty of firefighters, but where are the fires?|date=2013-09-07|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|accessdate=2017-09-22}}</ref>\u2014though fire departments still have to be able to respond to them\u2014and their existing ability to respond rapidly to emergencies.

In those departments, firefighters are often jointly trained as [[emergency medical technician]]s in order to deliver [[basic life support]], and more rarely as [[paramedics]] to deliver [[advanced life support]]. In the United Kingdom, where fire services and EMS are run separately, [[Fire Service Co-Responder|fire service co-responding]] has been introduced more recently.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/news/LatestNewsReleases_brigade-and-london-ambulance-service-team-up-for-life-saving-trial.asp#.WIpXBH2DEfI|title=News|website=www.london-fire.gov.uk|accessdate=5 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170813185751/http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/news/LatestNewsReleases_brigade-and-london-ambulance-service-team-up-for-life-saving-trial.asp#.WIpXBH2DEfI|archivedate=13 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Another point of variation is whether the firefighters respond in a fire engine or a [[Nontransporting EMS vehicle|response car]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/surrey-news/surrey-firefighters-called-300-medical-11295803|title=Surrey firefighters called to almost 300 medical emergencies during co-responding trial|publisher=[[Surrey Advertiser]]|date=9 May 2016|accessdate=3 September 2018}}</ref> Either way, separate employees to crew [[ambulance]]s are still needed, unless the firefighters can work shifts on the ambulances.\n\n===Specialized roles===\n====Aircraft rescue & firefighting====\n{{Main|Aircraft rescue and firefighting}}\n[[Airport]]s employ specialist firefighters to deal with potential ground emergencies. Due to the mass casualty potential of an aviation emergency, the speed with which emergency response equipment and personnel arrive at the scene of the emergency is of paramount importance. When dealing with an emergency, the airport firefighters are tasked with rapidly securing the aircraft, its crew and its passengers from all hazards, particularly fire. Airport firefighters have advanced training in the application of firefighting foams, dry chemical and clean agents used to extinguish burning aviation fuel.\n\n====Hazardous materials====\n[[File:Decontamination after incident at Archway - geograph.org.uk - 108750.jpg|thumb|[[Decontamination]] after a chemical spill]]\nFire departments are usually the primary agency that responds to an emergency involving [[hazardous material]]s. Specialized firefighters, known as hazardous materials technicians, have training and certification in chemical identification, leak control, decontamination, and clean-up procedures.\n\n===Fire prevention===\n[[File:FiremanPaffandElmo.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Firefighters frequently give fire prevention talks at schools and community events]]\n\nFire departments frequently provide advice to the public on how to prevent fires in the home and work-place environments.

Many fire officials recommend that every building, including residences, have [[fire sprinkler]] systems.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nfpa.org/Public-Education/Campaigns/Fire-Sprinkler-Initiative/Legislation-and-adoptions/Sprinkler-requirements|title=NFPA Fire Sprinkler Initiative|website=National Fire Protection Association (NFPA)|accessdate=8 July 2018}}</ref> Correctly working sprinklers in a residence ''greatly'' reduce the risk of death from a fire.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.firehouse.com/home/article/12096404/research-shows-residential-sprinklers-save-lives|title=Research Shows Residential Sprinklers Save Lives|last1=Pollack|first1=Keshia|date=August 24, 2015|accessdate=8 July 2018|publisher=SAGE Journal|last2=Frattaroli|first2=Shannon|issue=Fire and Worker Health and Safety|last3=Somers|first3=Scott}}</ref> With the small rooms typical of a residence, one or two sprinklers can cover most rooms.

This is normally accomplished in many innovative ways such as conducting presentations, distributing safety brochures, providing news articles, writing [[public safety announcement]]s (PSA) or establishing meaningful displays in well-visited areas. Ensuring that each household has working [[smoke alarm]]s, is educated in the proper techniques of fire safety, has an evacuation route and rendezvous point is of top priority in [[public education]] for most fire prevention teams in almost all fire department localities.\n\nFire investigators, who are experienced firefighters trained in fire cause determinism, are dispatched to fire scenes, in order to investigate and determine whether the fire was a result of an accident or intentional. Some fire investigators have full law enforcement powers to investigate and arrest suspected arsonists.\n\n==Occupational health and safety==\n===Direct risks===\n====Fires====\n[[File:Firemen's Monument, Boston by John A Wilson- far.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Firemen's Memorial (Boston)]] by [[John A. Wilson (sculptor)|John Wilson]]]]\n[[Image:Airport-firefighters-drill.jpg|thumb|right|Firefighters wearing [[Personal protective equipment|PPE]] tackle an aircraft fire during a drill at [[Dyess Air Force Base]] in [[Abilene, Texas]]]]\nTo allow protection from the inherent risks of fighting fires, firefighters wear and carry protective and self-rescue equipment at all times. A [[self-contained breathing apparatus]] (SCBA) delivers air to the firefighter through a [[full face mask]] and is worn to protect against [[smoke inhalation]], toxic fumes, and super heated gases. A special device called a [[PASS device|Personal Alert Safety System]] (PASS) is commonly worn independently or as a part of the SCBA to alert others when a firefighter stops moving for a specified period of time or manually operates the device. The PASS device sounds an alarm that can assist another firefighter ([[firefighter assist and search team]] (FAST), or [[rapid intervention team]] (RIT), in locating the firefighter in distress.\n\nFirefighters often carry personal self-rescue [[rope]]s. The ropes are generally 30 feet long and can provide a firefighter (that has enough time to deploy the rope) a partially controlled exit out of an elevated window. Lack of a personal rescue rope is cited in the deaths of two New York City Firefighters, Lt. John Bellew and Lt. Curtis Meyran, who died after they jumped from the fourth floor of a burning apartment building in the Bronx. Of the four firefighters who jumped and survived, only one of them had a self-rescue rope. Since the incident, the Fire Department of New York City has issued self-rescue ropes to their firefighters.<ref name=NYT>{{cite news |author=James Barron |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/24/nyregion/3-firefighters-die-in-blazes-in-brooklyn-and-bronx.html |title=3 Firefighters Die in Blazes in Brooklyn and Bronx |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 24, 2005 }}</ref>\n\n[[Hyperthermia|Heat injury]] is a major issue for firefighters as they wear insulated clothing and cannot shed the heat generated from physical exertion. Early detection of heat issues is critical to stop dehydration and heat stress becoming fatal. Early onset of heat stress affects cognitive function which combined with operating in dangerous environment makes heat stress and dehydration a critical issue to monitor. Firefighter physiological status monitoring is showing promise in alerting EMS and commanders to the status of their people on the fire ground. Devices such as [[PASS device]] alert 10\u201320 seconds after a firefighter has stopped moving in a structure. Physiological status monitors measure a firefighter's vital sign status, fatigue and exertion levels and transmit this information over their voice radio. This technology allows a degree of early warning to physiological stress. These devices<ref>Zephyr Technologies [http://www.zephyr-technology.com/bioharness-bt.html BioHarness BT] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407031009/http://www.zephyr-technology.com/bioharness-bt.html |date=2010-04-07 }}</ref> are similar to technology developed for [[Future Force Warrior]] and give a measure of exertion and fatigue. They also tell the people outside a building when they have stopped moving or fallen. This allows a supervisor to call in additional engines before the crew get exhausted and also gives an early warning to firefighters before they run out of air, as they may not be able to make voice calls over their radio.

Rhabdomyolysis is the breakdown of muscle tissue and has many causes including heat exposure, high core body temperature, and prolonged, intense exertion. Routine firefighter tasks, such as carrying extra weight of equipment and working in hot environments, can increase firefighters\u2019 risk for rhabdomyolysis.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2018-05-01|title=What structural fire fighters need to know about rhabdomyolysis.|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2018-133/pdfs/2018-133.pdf?id=10.26616/NIOSHPUB2018133|doi=10.26616/nioshpub2018133}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|date=2018-05-01|title=What wildland fire fighters need to know about rhabdomyolysis.|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2018-131/pdfs/2018-131.pdf?id=10.26616/NIOSHPUB2018131|doi=10.26616/nioshpub2018131}}</ref>\n\n====Structural collapses====\nAnother leading cause of death during firefighting is [[structural collapse]] of a burning building (e.g. a wall, floor, ceiling, roof, or [[truss|truss system]]). Structural collapse, which often occurs without warning, may crush or trap firefighters inside the structure. To avoid loss of life, all on-duty firefighters should maintain two-way communication with the [[incident commander]] and be equipped with a [[PASS device|personal alert safety system device]] on all fire scenes and maintain radio communication on all incidents(PASS).<ref>[[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] Alert: [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/99-146.html Preventing Injuries and Deaths of Fire Fighters due to Structural Collapse].

May 2005.</ref> [[Francis Brannigan]] was the founder and greatest contributor to this element of firefighter safety.\n\n====Traffic collisions====\nIn the United States, 25% of fatalities of firefighters are caused by [[traffic collision]]s while responding to or returning from an incident. Other firefighters have been injured or killed by vehicles at the scene of a fire or emergency (Paulison 2005). A common measure fire departments have taken to prevent this is to require firefighters to wear a bright yellow reflective vest over their turnout coats if they have to work on a public road, to make them more visible to passing drivers.<ref>Federal Highway Administration DOT 23CFR634 Worker Visibility</ref> In addition to the direct dangers of firefighting, cardiovascular diseases account for approximately 45% of on duty firefighter deaths.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The New England Journal of Medicine\", March 22, 2007, Accessed:July 17, 2011 |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=356 |issue=12 |pages=1207\u20131215 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa060357 |pmid=17377158 |year = 2007|last1 = Kales|first1 = Stefanos N.|last2=Soteriades |first2=Elpidoforos S. |last3=Christophi |first3=Costas A. |last4=Christiani |first4=David C. |citeseerx=10.1.1.495.4530 }}</ref>\n\n====Violence====\nFirefighters have sometimes been assaulted by members of the public while responding to calls. These kinds of attacks can cause firefighters to fear for their safety and may cause them to not have full focus on the situation which could result in injury to their selves or the patient.\n\n===Long-term risks===\n====Cardiovascular disease====\nFirefighting has long been associated with poor [[cardiovascular]] outcomes. In the United States, the most common cause of on-duty fatalities for firefighters is sudden cardiac death. In addition to personal factors that may predispose an individual to [[coronary artery disease]] or other [[cardiovascular disease]]s, occupational exposures can significantly increase a firefighter's risk. Historically, the fire service blamed poor firefighter physical condition for being the primary cause of cardiovascular related deaths. However, over the last 20 years, studies and research has indicated the toxic gasses put fire service personnel at significantly higher risk for cardiovascular related conditions and death. For instance, [[carbon monoxide]], present in nearly all fire environments, and [[hydrogen cyanide]], formed during the combustion of paper, cotton, plastics, and other substances containing [[carbon]] and [[nitrogen]]. The substances inside of materials change during combustion their bi-products interfere with the transport of oxygen in the body. [[hypoxia (medical)|Hypoxia]] can then lead to heart injury. In addition, chronic exposure to [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]] in smoke is associated with [[atherosclerosis]]. Noise exposures may contribute to [[hypertension]] and possibly ischemic heart disease. Other factors associated with firefighting, such as [[Stress (medicine)|stress]], [[heat stress]], and heavy physical exertion, also increase the risk of cardiovascular events.<ref>[[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] Alert: [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2007-133 Preventing Fire Fighter Fatalities Due to Heart Attacks and Other Sudden Cardiovascular Events.] July 2007.</ref>\n\nDuring fire suppression activities a firefighter can reach peak or near peak heart rates which can act as a trigger for a cardiac event. For example, [[tachycardia]] can cause plaque buildup to break loose and lodge itself is a small part of the heart causing [[myocardial infarction]], also known as a heart attack. This along with unhealthy habits and lack of exercise can be very hazardous to firefighter health.<ref>[University of Illinois] https://www.fsi.illinois.edu/documents{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} /research/CardioChemRisksModernFF_InterimReport2016.pdf</ref>\n\n====Cancer====\n[[File:Sailors participate in a fire drill exercise aboard USS Bainbridge (DDG 96).

Firefighters had [[mesothelioma]], which is caused by [[asbestos]] exposure, at twice the rate of the non-firefighting working population. Younger firefighters (under age 65) also developed [[bladder cancer]] and [[prostate cancer]] at higher rates than the general population.

In urban areas, this means that full-time paid firefighters usually have [[shift work]], with some providing cover each night. On the other hand, it may not be practical to employ full-time firefighters in villages and isolated small towns, where their services may not be required for days at a time. For this reason, many fire departments have firefighters who spend long periods on call to respond to infrequent emergencies; they may have regular jobs outside of firefighting. Whether they are paid or not varies by country. In the United States and Germany, [[volunteer fire department]]s provide most of the cover in rural areas. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, by contrast, actual volunteers are rare. Instead, \"[[retained firefighter]]s\" are paid for responding to incidents, along with a small salary for spending long periods of time on call.\n\n==Firefighting around the world==\n{{Further|Firefighting worldwide}}\n[[File:BSPP section Bastille Day 2008.jpg|thumb|The [[Paris Fire Brigade]] is a [[French Army]] unit which serves as the fire service for [[Paris]] and certain sites of national strategic importance.]]\n[[File:mtlfirechiefs.jpg|thumb|250px|Firefighters tackling a blaze in [[Montreal, Canada]]]]\nA key difference between many country's fire services is what the balance is between full-time and volunteer (or on-call) firefighters. In the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]], large metropolitan fire departments are almost entirely made up of full-time firefighters. On the other hand, in [[Germany]] and [[Austria]],<ref>[http://www.bundesfeuerwehrverband.at/oebfv/index.php?id=154 \u00d6sterreichischer Bundesfeuerwehrverband: Statistik des \u00d6BFV<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228111522/http://www.bundesfeuerwehrverband.at/oebfv/index.php?id=154 |date=2008-12-28 }}</ref> volunteers play a substantial role even in the largest fire departments, including Berlin's, which serves a population of 3.6 million. Regardless of how this balance works, a common feature is that smaller urban areas have a mix of full-time and volunteer/on-call firefighters. This is known in the United States as a [[combination fire department]]. In [[Chile]] and [[Peru]], all firefighters are volunteers.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-27186801|title=Chile's firefighters in spotlight after Valparaiso blaze |date=2014-04-29|accessdate=2019-07-17|work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\nAnother point of variation is how the fire services are organized. Some countries like [[Israel]] and [[New Zealand]] have a single national fire service. Others like Australia, the United Kingdom and France organize fire services based on regions or sub-national states. In the United States, Germany and [[Canada]], fire departments are run at a municipal level.\n\nAtypically, [[Singapore]] and many parts of [[Switzerland]] have [[Compulsory Fire Service|fire service conscription]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.swissfire.ch/fileadmin/swissfire/Der%20SFV/Factsheet_Feuerwehr_2015_d.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-08-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180128134257/http://www.swissfire.ch/fileadmin/swissfire/Der%20SFV/Factsheet_Feuerwehr_2015_d.pdf |archive-date=2018-01-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.scdf.gov.sg/content/scdf_internet/en/general/about-us.html |title=SCDF Website - GENERAL: About Us |access-date=2018-08-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161228102845/http://www.scdf.gov.sg/content/scdf_internet/en/general/about-us.html |archive-date=2016-12-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In Germany, conscription can also be used if a village does not have a functioning fire service.

For example, American fire departments make heavier use of [[Fire engine#Aerial apparatus|aerial appliances]], and are often split between engine and ladder companies. In Europe, where the size and usefulness of aerial appliances are often limited by narrow streets, they are only used for rescues, and firefighters can rotate between working on an engine and an aerial appliance.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fireapparatusmagazine.com/articles/print/volume-21/issue-6/features/fire-apparatus-united-states-vs-europe.html|title=United States vs. Europe|publisher=Fire Apparatus|date=2016-06-07|accessdate=2019-07-17}}</ref><ref name=\"fe-2008\">{{cite web|url=https://www.fireengineering.com/articles/2008/06/fire-commentary-european-firefighting-operations.html|title=Fire Commentary: European Firefighting Operations|publisher=Fire Engineering|date=2008-06-12|accessdate=2019-07-17}}</ref> A final point in variation is how involved firefighters are in [[emergency medical services]].\n\n==Communication and command structure==\n[[Image:NSWFB112.jpg|thumb|[[Fire and Rescue NSW|New South Wales Fire Brigade]] station officer (red helmet) and firefighters (yellow helmets), Australia]]\n\nThe expedient and accurate handling of fire alarms or calls are significant factors in the successful outcome of any incident. Fire department communications play a critical role in that successful outcome. Fire department communications include the methods by which the public can notify the communications center of an emergency, the methods by which the center can notify the proper fire fighting forces, and the methods by which information is exchanged at the scene. One method is to use a [[megaphone]] to communicate.\n\nA telecommunicator (often referred to as a [[000 Operator]]){{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} has a role different from but just as important as other emergency personnel. The telecommunicator must process calls from unknown and unseen individuals, usually calling under stressful conditions. He/she must be able to obtain complete, reliable information from the caller and prioritize requests for assistance. It is the dispatcher's responsibility to bring order to chaos.\n\nWhile some fire departments are large enough to utilize their own telecommunication dispatcher, most rural and small areas rely on a central dispatcher to provide handling of fire, rescue, and police services.\n\nFirefighters are trained to use [[Telecommunication|communications]] equipment to receive alarms, give and receive commands, request assistance, and report on conditions. Since firefighters from different agencies routinely provide mutual aid to each other, and routinely operate at incidents where other emergency services are present, it is essential to have structures in place to establish a unified chain of command, and share information between agencies. The U.S. [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) has established a National Incident Management System.<ref>[http://www.fema.gov/pdf/emergency/nims/NIMS_core.pdf]</ref> One component of this system is the [[Incident Command System]].\n\nAll [[radio communication]] in the United States is under authorization from the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC); as such, fire departments that operate radio equipment must have radio licenses from the FCC.\n\n[[Ten codes]] were popular in the early days of radio equipment because of poor transmission and reception. Advances in modern radio technology have reduced the need for ten-codes and many departments have converted to simple English (clear text).\n\n===Ranks===\nMany firefighters are sworn members with command structures similar to the [[military]] and [[police]]. They do not have general [[Police|police powers]] (some firefighters in the [[United States]] have limited police powers, like [[fire police]] departments, while certain [[fire marshal]]s have full police powers, i.e. the ability to make warrantless arrests, and authority to carry a firearm on and off-duty), but have specific powers of enforcement and control in fire and emergency situations.\n\nThe basic unit of an American fire department is a \"company\", a group of firefighters who typically work on the same engine. A \"crew\" or \"platoon\" is a subdivision of a company who work on the same shift. Commonwealth fire services are more likely to be organized around a \"watch\", who work the same shift on multiple engines.<ref>[http://www.humbersidefire.gov.uk/careers/becoming-a-firefighter/shift-patterns Humberside Fire and Rescue Service: Shift patterns]</ref>\n\n====Australia====\nNew South Wales Rural Fire Service\n\n{| cellpadding=\"5\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Additionally, in the volunteer fire departments, there is a difference between a rank and an official position. This is founded on the military traditions of the fire departments. Every firefighter can hold a high rank without having an official position. A firefighter can be promoted by years of service, training skills and qualifications. Official positions are partly elected or given by capabilities. These conditions allow that older ordinary firefighters have higher ranks than their leaders. But through this ranks are no authorities given ([[Brevet (military)|Brevet]]).\n\n;Professional Fire Fighters (Middle Technical Grades) of [[Rheinland-Pfalz]]\nCompleted vocational training in a technical occupation suitable for the fire service.

It is part of the Ministry of Interior's Department of Firefighters, Public Rescue and Public Protection. The CNVVF task is to provide safety for people, animals and property, and control the compliance of buildings and industries to fire safety rules. The Ministry of the Interior, through the CNVVF, adopts fire safety rules with ministerial decrees or other lower rank documents. The CNVVF also ensures public rescue in emergencies that involves the use of chemical weapons, bacteriological, radiological and materials.

In general, white helmets denote chief officers, while red helmets may denote company officers, but the specific meaning of a helmet's color or style varies from region to region and department to department. The rank of an officer in an American fire department is most commonly denoted by a number of [[speaking trumpet]]s, a reference to a [[megaphone]]-like device used in the early days of the fire service, although typically called \"[[bugle]]\" in today's parlance. Ranks proceed from one (lieutenant) to five (fire chief) bugles. Traditional ranks in American fire departments that exist but may not always be utilized in all cities or towns include:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| '''Firefighter'''\n::no bugles\n| '''Engineer/Technician/Sergeant'''\n::3 chevrons\n| '''Lieutenant'''\n::1 bugle\n|-\n| '''Captain'''\n::2 either traditionally side by side\n::or less usually crossed bugles\n| '''Battalion Chief/District Chief'''\n::2 either side by side\n::or more traditionally crossed bugles\n| '''Division Chief or Assistant /Deputy Asst.'''\n'''Chief/Commissioner'''\n::3 crossed bugles\n|-\n| '''Deputy Chief/Commissioner'''\n::4 crossed bugles\n| '''Chief/Commissioner'''\n::5 crossed bugles\n|\n|}\nIn many fire departments in the U.S., the captain is commonly the commander of a company and a lieutenant is the supervisor of the company's firefighters on shift. There is no state or federal rank structure for firefighters and each municipality or volunteer fire department creates and uses their own unique structure.\n\nStill, some other American fire departments such the FDNY use military rank insignia in addition or instead of the traditional bugles. Additionally, officers on [[Glossary of firefighting#T|truck companies]] have been known to use rank insignias shaped like axes for Lieutenants (1) and Captains (2).\n\n==Firefighter equipment==\n{{Main|Glossary of firefighting equipment}}\n<!-- Before you add anything else to this list, ask yourself \"Do many or most firefighters use this piece of equipment in a way that's notable, verifiable, and of interest to the general audience?\" If not, consider just adding it to the glossary of equipment article instead. -->\n<gallery>\nFile:TurkishFirefighterMOPP4.jpeg|Turkish firefighters in [[MOPP (protective gear)|MOPP]] 4 level protective gear during an exercise held at [[Incirlik Air Base]], [[Turkey]]\nFile:TFS fire equipment.jpg|[[Toronto Fire Services|Toronto firefighters]] prepare their equipment\nFile:03262012Demonstraciones_rescate_erum_fabian_acu\u00f1a137.JPG|A firefighter using a hydraulic cutter during a demonstration\nFile:Aa RN firefighter 01.jpg|[[Royal Navy|British naval men]] in firefighting gear on [[HMS Illustrious (R06)]], [[Liverpool]], 25 October 2009\n</gallery>\nA partial list of some equipment typically used by firefighters:\n* Hand tools, such as\n** Flat-head and pick-head [[axe]]\n** [[Pike pole]]\n** [[Halligan bar]]\n** [[Flashlight]]\n** [[Spanner wrench]]\n** Circular (\"K-12\"), Cutters Edge and chain saws\n** [[Hydraulic rescue tools]] such as spreaders, cutters, and rams\n* [[Personal protective equipment]] (\"PPE\") designed to withstand water and high temperatures, such as\n** [[Bunker gear]], including turnout jacket and pants\n** [[SCBA|Self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA)]]\n** Helmet, face mask and visor; climbing helmets\n** [[Safety boots]], gloves, and [[Nomex]] and Carbon flash hoods\n** [[PASS device|Personal alert safety system (PASS) device]]\n* Handheld radio, pager, or other communication devices\n* [[Thermal imaging camera (firefighting)|Thermal imaging camera]]\n* [[Gas detector]]\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of firefighting}}\n[[Image:Old firefighters.jpg|right|thumb|A picture of American firefighters in the 1770s]]\n[[File:Vancouver firemen responding to a fire alarm.jpg|thumb|Vancouver firemen responding to a fire alarm, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Photograph taken by W.J. Carpenter in 1910.]]\n\nAlthough people have fought fires since there have been valuable things to burn, the first instance of organized professionals combating structural fires occurred in Ancient [[Egypt]]. Likewise, fire fighters of the [[Roman Republic]] existed solely as privately organized and funded groups that operated more similarly to a business than a public service; however, during the [[Principate]] period [[Augustus]] revolutionized firefighting by calling for the creation of a fire guard that was trained, paid, and equipped by the state- the first truly public and professional firefighting service. Known as the [[Vigiles]], they were organised into cohorts and also served as a night watch and city police force.\n\nThe earliest American fire departments were volunteers, including the volunteer fire company in [[New Amsterdam]], now known as [[New York (state)|New York]].<ref>Essentials of Firefighting</ref> Fire companies were composed of citizens who volunteered their time to help protect the community. As time progressed and new towns popped up throughout the region there was a sharp increase in the number of volunteer departments. The first career fire department was not established in the United States until 1853 in Cincinnati, Ohio ([[Cincinnati Fire & EMS Department]]). Many large cities began establishing paid, full-time, staff in order to try facilitate greater fire-related call volume. St. Louis Fire Department followed Cincinnati four years later and became the second established career fire department in the country followed by other large cities like New York ([[FDNY]]). City fire departments draw their funding directly from city taxes and share the same budget as other public works like the police department and trash services. Aside from big city fire departments, many populated suburbs and towns have career fire departments. The primary difference between a municipality department and a City department is the funding. Municipal fire departments do not share their budget with any other service and are considered to be private entities within a jurisdiction. This means that they have their own taxes that feed into their budgeting needs. Another main difference is the structure of the department. City fire departments have the mayor at the top of the chain whereas municipal departments have elected board officials who help maintain and run the department along with the chief officer staff.\n\n==Fundraisers==\nFunds for fire-fighting equipment may be raised by the firefighters themselves, especially in the case of volunteer organizations. Events such as pancake breakfasts and chili feeds are common in the US. Social events are also used to raise money, including dances, community fairs and car washes.\n\n==Notable firefighters==\n{{Globalize|section|datej=December 2012|date=March 2020}}\n* [[James Braidwood (firefighter)]] (1800\u20131861), founder of the municipal fire brigade in Edinburgh, 1824\n* [[John Decker (fire chief)|John Decker]] (1823\u20131892), chief of the New York City department during the 1863 draft riots\n* [[Ra\u00fal G\u00e1ndara-Cartagena]] (1895\u20131989), first and kilongest-serving Puerto Rico commonwealth fire chief\n* [[James J.
