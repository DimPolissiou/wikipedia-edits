The plan of the church consists of a nave and [[chancel]] with no structural division.  There are north and south [[aisle]]s extending along both the nave and the chancel.  The aisles at the sides of the chancel are now used as [[vestry|vestries]].  Above both the nave and the chancel is a [[clerestory]].

In 1948 the couple divorced. That same year she married [[music critic]] Frank Sandiford, with Dizzy Gillespie performing at the wedding. The couple were active in the [[bohemian lifestyle]] and [[jazz]] scene of Chicago hence their connection with Gillespie.

She took little interest in other artists' work, although she admired [[Magritte]].<ref>Weininger and Smith 1991, p. 67.</ref> Largely self-taught, she did not regard her lack of extensive formal training as a hindrance.<ref>Weininger and Smith 1991, p. 13.</ref> She said of her work: <blockquote>I am not interested in complicated things nor in the commonplace. I like and like to paint simple things that are a little strange. My work comes directly from my inner consciousness and it must come easily.

Called \"the queen of the bohemian artists\", Abercrombie was involved in the Chicago [[jazz]] scene and was friends with musicians such as [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Charlie Parker]], and [[Sarah Vaughan]], whose music inspired her own creative work.<ref name=Warren>Warren, Lynn, ''Art in Chicago 1945-1995'', Thames & Hudson, 1996 {{ISBN|978-0-500-23728-1}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nAbercrombie was born on February 17, 1909, in [[Austin, Texas]].<ref name=\"Sparks\">{{cite book |last1=Sparks |first1=Esther |title=A Biographical Dictionary of Painters and Sculptors in Illinois 1808-1945 |date=1971 |publisher=Northwestern University |location=Chicago |page=235}}</ref> Her parents, Tom and Lula Janes Abercrombie, were traveling [[opera singer]]s who happened to be in Austin on the day of Gertrude's birth. The family lived in [[Berlin]] in 1913 to further her mother's career, but the beginning of [[World War I]] caused the family to move back to the United States.<ref name=\"AAA1\"/> Upon their return the family lived in [[Aledo, Illinois]], before settling in [[Hyde Park, Chicago]] in 1916. She was raised in a strict [[Christian Scientist]] environment at home.\n\nShe earned a degree in [[Romance languages]] from the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign]] in 1929.<ref name=\"Weininger12\">Weininger and Smith 1991, p. 12.</ref> After studying [[figure drawing]] briefly at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], she took a year-long course in [[commercial art]] at the [[American Academy of Art]] in Chicago, leading to her first job drawing gloves for [[Mesirow Department Store]] advertisements. She also worked briefly as an artist for [[Sears]].<ref name=\"AAA1\"/>\n\n==Fine art career==\nIn 1932 she began to focus strictly on her art.<ref>[http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&sid=7631b08d-1454-4614-91e9-e0e3a19b2eb7%40sessionmgr4006 Dalati, Sammy. \"The Surreal Art of the Chicago Saloniste Gertrude Abercrombie.\" ''The Magazine Antiques''<nowiki> [New York] 2018: 48.

In 1948 the couple divorced. That same year she married [[music critic]] Frank Sandiford, with Dizzy Gillespie performing at the wedding. The couple were active in the [[bohemian lifestyle]] and [[jazz]] scene of Chicago hence their connection with Gillespie. They met musicians through Sandiford and through Abercrombie's own skills as an improvisational [[pianist]]. The couple would divorce in 1964.<ref name=\"AAA1\"/> \n[[File:Abercrombie and Dizzy.jpg|thumb|left|Dizzy Gillespie with Abercrombie on his birthday, 1964]]\nWithin Abercrombie's [[avant-garde]] social circle she was the inspiration for the song \"Gertrude's Bounce\" by [[Richie Powell]], who claimed that she walked \"just like the way the rhythm sounds in the Introduction\",<ref>LP sleeve notes by Alun Morgan for Clifford Brown and Max Roach, ''I Remember Clifford'' (Mercury MMC 14041)</ref> and she appeared as herself in [[James Purdy]]'s ''Gertrude of Stony Island Avenue'' and as a fictional character in Purdy's ''Malcolm, Eustace Chisholm''.<ref name=\"AAA1\">{{cite web | authorr=| year=2011 | title=Finding Aid | work=Gertrude Abercrombie Papers | publisher=Archives of American Art | url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/gertrude-abercrombie-papers-5608/more | accessdate=15 Jun 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nBy the late 1950s, her health declined due to financial trouble, [[alcoholism]], and [[arthritis]], and she became reclusive.

Many compositions feature a lone woman in a flowing gown, often depicted with attributes of sorcery: an owl, a black cat, a [[crystal ball]], or a [[broomstick]].<ref name=\"AAA1\"/> These works were often self-portraits, as she stated in an interview with [[Studs Terkel]] shortly before her death: \"it is always myself that I paint\".<ref>Weininger and Smith 1991, p. 11.</ref> Tall and sharp-featured, she considered herself ugly;<ref>Weininger and Smith 1991, pp. 33, 77.</ref> in life she sometimes wore a pointed velvet hat to accentuate her witch-like appearance, \"enjoy[ing] the power this artifice gave her over others who would fear or recoil from her\".<ref>Weininger and Smith 1991, p. 19.</ref> Abercrombie also drew inspiration from her dreams as a \"self Proclaimed\" source for her paintings to convey reality, but with illusions of fantasy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://karmakarma.org/texts/gertrude-abercrombie-susan-weininger/|title=Gertrude Abercrombie, 2018, Gertrude Abercrombie, Susan Weininger|website=Karma|language=en|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref>The 1940s and '50s are described as her most prolific and productive period; a time when she no longer painted many portraits, but retained the themes mentioned above.<ref name=\"AAA1\"/>\n\nAbercrombie's mature works are painted in a precise, controlled style. She took little interest in other artists' work, although she admired [[Magritte]].<ref>Weininger and Smith 1991, p. 67.</ref> Largely self-taught, she did not regard her lack of extensive formal training as a hindrance.<ref>Weininger and Smith 1991, p. 13.</ref> She said of her work: <blockquote>I am not interested in complicated things nor in the commonplace.

''Franco Biondi Santi. The gentleman of Brunello''. Veronelli Editore. {{ISBN|88-7250-115-6}}</ref>\n\nThe wines were almost unknown until Italy's famous wine and food critic [[Luigi Veronelli]]\ndiscovered them by chance in the early 1960s.<ref name=KO-wofw/> Veronelli recounted his first meeting with the Prince: 'I was in Latium writing on the region's wines, and while driving on the ancient Appian Way I spotted the most beautiful vineyards. I followed the road until I came to an imposing estate where I stopped and rang the bell. When nobody responded I tried the gate and found it open. Audaciously I went in and was walking around when I suddenly heard the sound of horse hooves racing up behind me. I turned and found myself looking down the barrel of a gun.'<ref name=KO-wofw/> After Veronelli explained who he was and his interest in the vineyards, the Prince invited Veronelli to try his wines. 'As soon as I tried his wines, I knew he truly was a prince' said Veronelli, who convinced him to sell some of the wines, up to then only for personal consumption.<ref name=KO-wofw/>\n\n[[Luigi Veronelli]] stated that Prince Boncompagni Ludovisi was the first to employ \"biological farming\" practices in Italy.<ref name=vv/> He compared Fiorano red wines to [[Sassicaia]], and once wrote of them, \"They enchant you with the first taste, burrow in your memory and make you forever better\", and, \"If I lived in Rome, I would beg for them at the prince's door every morning\".<ref name=nyt-ea04/> It was the whites though that most impressed him. The Fiorano Bianco from Malvasia di Candia soared to new heights of complexity while the Semillon, a variety that has never had much success in Italy, astounded Veronelli.<ref name=KO-wofw/>\n\nThe relationship between Boncompagni  Ludovisi and his wine merchants has been described as strained due to the Prince's eccentric manner of doing business. Over time, import of the wines ceased, and although wine was made until 1995, the sale of bottles had ended some time before.<ref name=nyt-ea04/> Elio Mariani, owner of the Checchino restaurant in Rome, confirms that the Prince was unusually stubborn.<ref name=KO-wofw/> According to Mariani: 'The Prince never really wanted to sell the wines. He made it very difficult; one had to call up to order the wines and come in person to collect them on the assigned day at a specified time and bring the exact amount in cash. They would not give change, and cheques were out of the question.'<ref name=KO-wofw/>\n\nIn 1966 Prince Boncompagni Ludovisi's sole daughter Francesca married [[Antinori|Piero Antinori]], a winemaker with a reputation associated with the modernist wine movement. When Boncompagni Ludovisi pulled out nearly all Fiorano vines following the 1995 harvest while giving no explanation,<ref name=nyt-ea04/> subsequent rumours claimed this was in order to prevent his son-in-law from ruining the Fiorano legacy.<ref name=vv/> Antinori told [[Eric Asimov]] that he believed Boncompagni Ludovisi could not bear the thought of anybody else making his wines after he could no longer do it himself.<ref name=nyt-ea09/> In a 2001 interview, Boncompagni Ludovisi stated that his reasons were the vines' advanced age and poor health.<ref name=vv/>\n\nDue to his poor health Prince Alberico Boncompagni Ludovisi went to live in Rome. His cousin Prince Paolo Boncompagni Ludovisi and his son Alessandrojacopo<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gabbrielli, Andrea (June\u2013July 2014)|first1=Spirito di Vino|title=''Fiorano il grande nettare di Roma''|url=http://www.spiritodivino.biz/prodotto.aspx?pid=10485}}</ref> came to help him run the estate. Recognizing Alessandrojacopo\u2019s passion for the job,  Prince Alberico gave him the replanting rights and a small portion of the estate and, considering him as his successor, suggested he replant the vineyard (''The Prince said he would destroy all his vines rather than see Piero get hold of them.

Veronelli Editore. {{ISBN|88-7250-115-6}}</ref>\n\nThe wines were almost unknown until Italy's famous wine and food critic [[Luigi Veronelli]]\ndiscovered them by chance in the early 1960s.<ref name=KO-wofw/> Veronelli recounted his first meeting with the Prince: 'I was in Latium writing on the region's wines, and while driving on the ancient Appian Way I spotted the most beautiful vineyards. I followed the road until I came to an imposing estate where I stopped and rang the bell. When nobody responded I tried the gate and found it open. Audaciously I went in and was walking around when I suddenly heard the sound of horse hooves racing up behind me. I turned and found myself looking down the barrel of a gun.'<ref name=KO-wofw/> After Veronelli explained who he was and his interest in the vineyards, the Prince invited Veronelli to try his wines. 'As soon as I tried his wines, I knew he truly was a prince' said Veronelli, who convinced him to sell some of the wines, up to then only for personal consumption.<ref name=KO-wofw/>\n\n[[Luigi Veronelli]] stated that Prince Boncompagni Ludovisi was the first to employ \"biological farming\" practices in Italy.<ref name=vv/> He compared Fiorano red wines to [[Sassicaia]], and once wrote of them, \"They enchant you with the first taste, burrow in your memory and make you forever better\", and, \"If I lived in Rome, I would beg for them at the prince's door every morning\".<ref name=nyt-ea04/> It was the whites though that most impressed him. The Fiorano Bianco from Malvasia di Candia soared to new heights of complexity while the Semillon, a variety that has never had much success in Italy, astounded Veronelli.<ref name=KO-wofw/>\n\nThe relationship between Boncompagni  Ludovisi and his wine merchants has been described as strained due to the Prince's eccentric manner of doing business. Over time, import of the wines ceased, and although wine was made until 1995, the sale of bottles had ended some time before.<ref name=nyt-ea04/> Elio Mariani, owner of the Checchino restaurant in Rome, confirms that the Prince was unusually stubborn.<ref name=KO-wofw/> According to Mariani: 'The Prince never really wanted to sell the wines. He made it very difficult; one had to call up to order the wines and come in person to collect them on the assigned day at a specified time and bring the exact amount in cash. They would not give change, and cheques were out of the question.'<ref name=KO-wofw/>\n\nIn 1966 Prince Boncompagni Ludovisi's sole daughter Francesca married [[Antinori|Piero Antinori]], a winemaker with a reputation associated with the modernist wine movement. When Boncompagni Ludovisi pulled out nearly all Fiorano vines following the 1995 harvest while giving no explanation,<ref name=nyt-ea04/> subsequent rumours claimed this was in order to prevent his son-in-law from ruining the Fiorano legacy.<ref name=vv/> Antinori told [[Eric Asimov]] that he believed Boncompagni Ludovisi could not bear the thought of anybody else making his wines after he could no longer do it himself.<ref name=nyt-ea09/> In a 2001 interview, Boncompagni Ludovisi stated that his reasons were the vines' advanced age and poor health.<ref name=vv/>\n\nDue to his poor health Prince Alberico Boncompagni Ludovisi went to live in Rome. His cousin Prince Paolo Boncompagni Ludovisi and his son Alessandrojacopo<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gabbrielli, Andrea (June\u2013July 2014)|first1=Spirito di Vino|title=''Fiorano il grande nettare di Roma''|url=http://www.spiritodivino.biz/prodotto.aspx?pid=10485}}</ref> came to help him run the estate. Recognizing Alessandrojacopo\u2019s passion for the job,  Prince Alberico gave him the replanting rights and a small portion of the estate and, considering him as his successor, suggested he replant the vineyard (''The Prince said he would destroy all his vines rather than see Piero get hold of them.  I do not think he likes the modern methods that Piero uses to make Antinori wine.  When the Prince was asked if he would save the vines for his grandchildren, he said that they learned about wine from their father, Piero, and not from him.'').<ref>{{cite news|last1=Scicolone, Charles|first1=(August 18, 2008)|title=''Fiorano Rosso, The Noblest Roman Of Them All''|url=http://www.i-italy.org/node/3892}}</ref> Under Prince Alberico\u2019s precise instructions, Alessandrojacopo restored the vineyard by planting [[Cabernet Sauvignon]] and [[Merlot]] to resume production of Fiorano Rosso wine.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Cernilli, Daniele (2014)|first1=Giulio Einaudi Editore|title=''I racconti di Doctor Wine''|url=http://www.doctorwine.it/en/det_articolo.php?id_articolo=206|ISBN=978-88-06-22016-7}}</ref> As for the white grapes, Prince Alberico insisted that the old varieties be abandoned in favor of [[Grechetto]] and [[Viognier]] to make Fiorano Bianco wine.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Parla, Katie (April 23, 2014)|first1=Punch|title=''The Feud Over Italy\u2019s Most Mysterious Wine Estate''|url=http://punchdrink.com/articles/the-feud-over-italys-most-mysterious-wine-estate/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Gambero Rosso|first1=(October 2, 2012)|title=''Tre Bicchieri 2013: Lazio''|url=http://www.gamberorosso.it/component/k2/item/328415-tre-bicchieri-2013-lazio-dai-castelli-la-via-della-qualita-}}</ref> Alessandrojacopo did everything Prince Alberico told him to do, from the choice of soils, to the clones and the system of vine-training, all done by organic method, right through to the making of the wine which is still done with the same craftsmanship as under Prince Alberico.

For example, the inverse S-box of b8{{sub|16}} is 9a{{sub|16}}. It is calculated by first calculating the inverse affine transformation of the input value, followed by the multiplicative inverse. The inverse affine transformation is as follows:\n\n:<math>\n  \\begin{bmatrix} b_0\\\\ b_1\\\\ b_2\\\\ b_3\\\\ b_4\\\\ b_5\\\\ b_6\\\\ b_7\\end{bmatrix} =\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n     0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n     1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n     0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n     1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n     0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n     0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n     1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n     0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    s_0\\\\ s_1\\\\ s_2\\\\ s_3\\\\ s_4\\\\ s_5\\\\ s_6\\\\ s_7\n  \\end{bmatrix} + \\begin{bmatrix}\n    1\\\\ 0\\\\ 1\\\\ 0\\\\ 0\\\\ 0\\\\ 0\\\\ 0\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\n\nThe inverse affine transformation also represents the sum of multiple rotations of the byte as a Vector, where addition is the XOR operation:\n: <math> b = (s \\lll 1) \\oplus (s \\lll 3) \\oplus (s \\lll 6) \\oplus 5_{16}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\oplus</math> is the [[bitwise XOR]] operator, <math>\\lll</math> is a left bitwise [[circular shift]], and the constant {{math|5<sub>16</sub> {{=}} 00000101<sub>2</sub>}} is given in [[hexadecimal]].{{clear}}\n\n== Design criteria ==\n\nThe Rijndael S-Box was specifically designed to be resistant to [[linear cryptanalysis|linear]] and [[differential cryptanalysis|differential]] cryptanalysis. This was done by minimizing the correlation between linear transformations of input/output bits, and at the same time minimizing the difference propagation probability.\n\nThe Rijndael S-Box can be replaced in the Rijndael cipher,<ref name=\"rijndael_cipher\" /> which defeats the suspicion of a backdoor built into the cipher that exploits a static S-box. The authors claim that the Rijndael cipher structure should provide enough resistance against differential and linear cryptanalysis if an S-Box with \"average\" correlation / difference propagation properties is used.\n\n== Example implementation in C language ==\n\nThe following [[C (programming language)|C]] code calculates the S-box:\n<source lang=\"C\">\n#include <stdint.h>\n\n#define ROTL8(x,shift) ((uint8_t) ((x) << (shift)) | ((x) >> (8 - (shift))))\n\nvoid initialize_aes_sbox(uint8_t sbox[256]) {\n\tuint8_t p = 1, q = 1;\n\t\n\t/* loop invariant: p * q == 1 in the Galois field */\n\tdo {\n\t\t/* multiply p by 3 */\n\t\tp = p ^ (p << 1) ^ (p & 0x80 ? 0x1B : 0);\n\n\t\t/* divide q by 3 (equals multiplication by 0xf6) */\n\t\tq ^= q << 1;\n\t\tq ^= q << 2;\n\t\tq ^= q << 4;\n\t\tq ^= q & 0x80 ? 0x09 : 0;\n\n\t\t/* compute the affine transformation */\n\t\tuint8_t xformed = q ^ ROTL8(q, 1) ^ ROTL8(q, 2) ^ ROTL8(q, 3) ^ ROTL8(q, 4);\n\n\t\tsbox[p] = xformed ^ 0x63;\n\t} while (p != 1);\n\n\t/* 0 is a special case since it has no inverse */\n\tsbox[0] = 0x63;\n}\n</source>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Advanced Encryption Standard]]\n[[Category:Finite fields]]\n[[Category:S-box]]\n", "text_old": "The '''Rijndael S-box''' is a [[S-box|substitution box]] ([[lookup table]]) used in the Rijndael cipher, which the [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] (AES) cryptographic [[algorithm]] was based on.<ref name=\"rijndael_cipher\">{{cite web | url=http://csrc.nist.gov/archive/aes/rijndael/Rijndael-ammended.pdf#page=1 | title=The Rijndael Block Cipher | accessdate=2013-11-11}}</ref>\n\n== Forward S-box ==\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"font-size:80%\"\n|+ AES S-Box\n!\n! 00 !! 01 !! 02 !! 03 !! 04 !! 05 !! 06 !! 07 !! 08 !! 09 !! 0a !! 0b !! 0c !! 0d !! 0e !! 0f \n|-\n! 00 \n| 63 || 7c || 77 || 7b || f2 || 6b || 6f || c5 || 30 || 01 || 67 || 2b || fe || d7 || ab || 76 \n|-\n! 10 \n| ca || 82 || c9 || 7d || fa || 59 || 47 || f0 || ad || d4 || a2 || af || 9c || a4 || 72 || c0 \n|-\n! 20 \n| b7 || fd || 93 || 26 || 36 || 3f || f7 || cc || 34 || a5 || e5 || f1 || 71 || d8 || 31 || 15 \n|-\n! 30 \n| 04 || c7 || 23 || c3 || 18 || 96 || 05 || 9a || 07 || 12 || 80 || e2 || eb || 27 || b2 || 75 \n|-\n! 40 \n| 09 || 83 || 2c || 1a || 1b || 6e || 5a || a0 || 52 || 3b || d6 || b3 || 29 || e3 || 2f || 84 \n|-\n! 50 \n| 53 || d1 || 00 || ed || 20 || fc || b1 || 5b || 6a || cb || be || 39 || 4a || 4c || 58 || cf \n|-\n! 60 \n| d0 || ef || aa || fb || 43 || 4d || 33 || 85 || 45 || f9 || 02 || 7f || 50 || 3c || 9f || a8 \n|-\n! 70 \n| 51 || a3 || 40 || 8f || 92 || 9d || 38 || f5 || bc || b6 || da || 21 || 10 || ff || f3 || d2 \n|-\n! 80 \n| cd || 0c || 13 || ec || 5f || 97 || 44 || 17 || c4 || a7 || 7e || 3d || 64 || 5d || 19 || 73 \n|-\n! 90 \n| 60 || 81 || 4f || dc || 22 || 2a || 90 || 88 || 46 || ee || b8 || 14 || de || 5e || 0b || db \n|-\n! a0 \n| e0 || 32 || 3a || 0a || 49 || 06 || 24 || 5c || c2 || d3 || ac || 62 || 91 || 95 || e4 || 79 \n|-\n! b0 \n| e7 || c8 || 37 || 6d || 8d || d5 || 4e || a9 || 6c || 56 || f4 || ea || 65 || 7a || ae || 08 \n|-\n! c0 \n| ba || 78 || 25 || 2e || 1c || a6 || b4 || c6 || e8 || dd || 74 || 1f || 4b || bd || 8b || 8a \n|-\n! d0 \n| 70 || 3e || b5 || 66 || 48 || 03 || f6 || 0e || 61 || 35 || 57 || b9 || 86 || c1 || 1d || 9e \n|-\n! e0 \n| e1 || f8 || 98 || 11 || 69 || d9 || 8e || 94 || 9b || 1e || 87 || e9 || ce || 55 || 28 || df \n|-\n! f0 \n| 8c || a1 || 89 || 0d || bf || e6 || 42 || 68 || 41 || 99 || 2d || 0f || b0 || 54 || bb || 16 \n|-\n| colspan=17 width=20em | The column is determined by the least significant [[nibble]], and the row by the most significant nibble.

Both the input and output are interpreted as polynomials over {{math|GF(2)}}. First, the input is mapped to its [[multiplicative inverse]] in {{math|1=GF(2<sup>8</sup>) = GF(2)[''x'']/(''x''<sup>8</sup> + ''x''<sup>4</sup> + ''x''<sup>3</sup> + ''x'' + 1)}}, [[Finite field arithmetic#Rijndael's finite field|Rijndael's finite field]].

The inverse affine transformation is as follows:\n\n:<math>\n  \\begin{bmatrix} b_0\\\\ b_1\\\\ b_2\\\\ b_3\\\\ b_4\\\\ b_5\\\\ b_6\\\\ b_7\\end{bmatrix} =\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n     0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n     1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n     0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n     1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n     0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n     0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n     1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n     0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    s_0\\\\ s_1\\\\ s_2\\\\ s_3\\\\ s_4\\\\ s_5\\\\ s_6\\\\ s_7\n  \\end{bmatrix} + \\begin{bmatrix}\n    1\\\\ 0\\\\ 1\\\\ 0\\\\ 0\\\\ 0\\\\ 0\\\\ 0\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\n\nThe inverse affine transformation also represents the sum of multiple rotations of the byte as a Vector, where addition is the XOR operation:\n: <math> b = (s \\lll 1) \\oplus (s \\lll 3) \\oplus (s \\lll 6) \\oplus 5_{16}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\oplus</math> is the [[bitwise XOR]] operator, <math>\\lll</math> is a left bitwise [[circular shift]], and the constant {{math|5<sub>16</sub> {{=}} 00000101<sub>2</sub>}} is given in [[hexadecimal]].{{clear}}\n\n== Design criteria ==\n\nThe Rijndael S-Box was specifically designed to be resistant to [[linear cryptanalysis|linear]] and [[differential cryptanalysis|differential]] cryptanalysis. This was done by minimizing the correlation between linear transformations of input/output bits, and at the same time minimizing the difference propagation probability.\n\nThe Rijndael S-Box can be replaced in the Rijndael cipher,<ref name=\"rijndael_cipher\" /> which defeats the suspicion of a backdoor built into the cipher that exploits a static S-box. The authors claim that the Rijndael cipher structure should provide enough resistance against differential and linear cryptanalysis if an S-Box with \"average\" correlation / difference propagation properties is used.\n\n== Example implementation in C language ==\n\nThe following [[C (programming language)|C]] code calculates the S-box:\n<source lang=\"C\">\n#include <stdint.h>\n\n#define ROTL8(x,shift) ((uint8_t) ((x) << (shift)) | ((x) >> (8 - (shift))))\n\nvoid initialize_aes_sbox(uint8_t sbox[256]) {\n\tuint8_t p = 1, q = 1;\n\t\n\t/* loop invariant: p * q == 1 in the Galois field */\n\tdo {\n\t\t/* multiply p by 3 */\n\t\tp = p ^ (p << 1) ^ (p & 0x80 ? 0x1B : 0);\n\n\t\t/* divide q by 3 (equals multiplication by 0xf6) */\n\t\tq ^= q << 1;\n\t\tq ^= q << 2;\n\t\tq ^= q << 4;\n\t\tq ^= q & 0x80 ? 0x09 : 0;\n\n\t\t/* compute the affine transformation */\n\t\tuint8_t xformed = q ^ ROTL8(q, 1) ^ ROTL8(q, 2) ^ ROTL8(q, 3) ^ ROTL8(q, 4);\n\n\t\tsbox[p] = xformed ^ 0x63;\n\t} while (p != 1);\n\n\t/* 0 is a special case since it has no inverse */\n\tsbox[0] = 0x63;\n}\n</source>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Advanced Encryption Standard]]\n[[Category:Finite fields]]\n[[Category:S-box]]\n", "name_user": "EnronEvolved", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eForward S-box:Repointing a link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rijndael_S-box"}
{"title_page": "Climate of Australia", "text_new": "{{Use Australian English|date=February 2019}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2020}}\n'''Australia's climate''' is governed mostly by its size and by the hot, sinking air of the [[Subtropics|subtropical]] [[high pressure]] belt. This moves north-west and north-east with the [[season]]s. The climate is variable, with frequent droughts lasting several seasons, thought to be caused in part by the [[El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation]]. Australia has a wide variety of climates due to its large geographical size. The largest part of [[Australia]] is [[desert]] or [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]]. Only the south-east and south-west corners have a [[temperate climate]] and moderately [[Soil fertility|fertile soil]]. The northern part of the country has a [[tropical climate]], varying between [[grassland]]s and desert. Australia holds many heat-related records: the continent has the hottest extended region year-round, the areas with the hottest summer climate, and the highest sunshine duration.\n\nBecause Australia is a medium-sized continent, separated from polar regions by the [[Southern Ocean]], it is not subject to movements of frigid polar air during winter, of the type that sweep over the continents in the northern hemisphere during their winter. Consequently, Australia's winter is relatively mild, with less contrast between summer and winter temperatures than in the northern continents. Seasonal highs and lows can still be considerable. Temperatures have ranged from above {{convert|53|C}} to well below {{convert|0|C}}. Minimum temperatures are moderated.\n\nThe El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation is associated with seasonal abnormality in many areas in the world. Australia is one of the continents most affected and experiences [[Drought in Australia|extensive drought]]s alongside considerable wet periods. Occasionally a [[dust storm]] will blanket a region and there are reports of the occasional [[tornado]]. Tropical cyclones, [[heat wave]]s, [[Bushfires in Australia|bushfire]]s and [[frost]]s in the country are also associated with the Southern Oscillation. Rising levels of [[salinity]] and [[desertification]] in some areas is ravaging the landscape.\n\n[[Climate change in Australia]] is a highly contentious political issue.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/30/science/earth/human-related-climate-change-led-to-extreme-heat-scientists-say.html ''Scientists Trace Extreme Heat in Australia to Climate Change''] 29 September 2014 NYT</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=State of the Climate 2014|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/state-of-the-climate/|work=Bureau of Meteorology|accessdate=29 March 2014}}</ref> Temperatures in the country rose by approximately 0.7&nbsp;\u00b0C between 1910 and 2004, following an [[global warming|increasing trend of global warming]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2014/s3956656.htm|title=CSIRO report says Australia getting hotter with more to come|work=ABC Online|date=4 March 2014|accessdate=20 April 2014}}</ref> Overnight minimum temperatures have warmed more rapidly than daytime maximum temperatures in recent years.

The eastern portion has a [[temperate climate]], ranging from [[Humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]] from its northern border to the [[Central Coast (New South Wales)|Central Coast]] and most of Sydney, and [[oceanic climate|oceanic]] to the south coast. The [[Snowy Mountains]] region in the south-east falls in the [[alpine climate]] or [[subpolar oceanic climate]] zone, with cool to cold weather all year around and snowfalls in the winter. Further inland, the climate is semi-arid and a [[desert climate]] towards the western part of the state.\n\nThe weather in the southern half of the state is generally warm to hot in summer and cool in the winter. The seasons are more defined in the southern half of the state, especially in the [[South West Slopes]], [[Central West (New South Wales)|Central West]] and the [[Riverina]] regions. Rainfall usually peaks in the summer in most of parts of the state, though the Riverina region, which is in the southern-central part of the state, bordering [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], has drier summers and a winter rainfall peak. On a hot summer day, a [[southerly buster]] may at times moderate the extreme heat experienced in the coastal New South Wales region, from [[Port Macquarie]] southwards to [[Nowra]].<ref>[http://www.bom.gov.au/social/2011/10/southerly-busters/ Southerly Busters Explained]. The Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology. Accessed 21 February 2012.</ref>\n\nThe warmest region is the [[Far West (New South Wales)|north-west]], where summers are very hot, and winters cooler and drier. The weather in the [[Northern Rivers|northeast region]] of the state, or the [[New South Wales North Coast|North Coast]], bordering [[Queensland]], is hot and humid in the summer, with a rainfall peak, and mild in winter with more sunshine, and little seasonal temperature difference. The [[Northern Tablelands]] have relatively mild summers and cold winters, due to their high elevation in the [[Great Dividing Range]].\n\nThe coldest region is the [[Snowy Mountains]] where the snow and frost continues for a long period during the winter months. The [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]], [[Southern Tablelands]] and [[Central Tablelands]], which are situated on the Great Dividing Range, have mild to warm summers and cold winters, although not as severe as those in the Snowy Mountains. Some areas situated in or around the range, such as [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]], [[Goulburn, New South Wales|Goulburn]] and [[Bowral, New South Wales|Bowral]], among other places, have recorded freezing and/or near-freezing lows in most months of the year, unlike other places of similar latitude and altitude in the northern hemisphere.\n\nThe highest maximum temperature recorded was {{convert|49.8|C}} at [[Menindee, New South Wales|Menindee]] in the state's west on 10 January 1939. The lowest minimum temperature was {{convert|-23.0|C}} at [[Charlotte Pass, New South Wales|Charlotte Pass]] on 29 June 1994 in the Snowy Mountains. This is also the lowest temperature recorded in the whole of Australia excluding [[Australian Antarctic Territory]].<ref name=\"weatherrecords\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/extreme/records/national.pdf|title=Rainfall and Temperature Records: National|publisher=Bureau of Meteorology (BOM)|accessdate=17 November 2009|format=PDF}}</ref>\n\nRainfall varies throughout the state.

distinctive climate zones. The northern end, including [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], has a [[tropical savanna climate|tropical savannah climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen ''Aw'']])<ref>{{cite web|title=CHAPTER 7: Introduction to the Atmosphere|work=physicalgeography.net|url=http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/7v.html|accessdate=15 July 2008}}</ref> with high humidity and two seasons, the wet (October to April) and dry season (May to September). During the dry season nearly every day is warm and sunny, and afternoon humidity averages around 30%. There is very little rainfall between May and September. In the coolest months of June and July, the daily minimum temperature may dip as low as {{convert|14|C}}, but very rarely lower, and frost has never been recorded.\n\nThe wet season is associated with [[tropical cyclone]]s and monsoon rains. The majority of rainfall occurs between December and March (the [[Southern Hemisphere]] summer), when thunderstorms are common and afternoon relative humidity averages over 70% during the wettest months. On average more than {{convert|1570|mm|abbr=on}} of rain falls in the north. Thunderstorms can produce spectacular [[lightning]] displays.\n\n[[File:Evening monsoonal squall.jpg|thumb|left|Monsoonal squall nears Darwin]]\nThe rest of the territory lies in the desert centre of the country; it includes [[Alice Springs]] and [[Uluru]], and is arid or semi-arid with little rain usually falling during the hottest months from October to March. Its seasons are more defined than the northern parts, with summers being very hot, with average temperatures often exceeding {{convert|35|C}}, and winters relatively cool with average minimum temperatures dipping as low as {{convert|5|C}}, with a few frosty nights. [[Central Australia]] receives less than {{convert|250|mm|0|abbr=on}} of annual rainfall.\n\nThe highest maximum temperature recorded in the territory was {{convert|48.3|C}} at [[Aputula|Finke]] on 1 and 2 January 1960. The lowest minimum temperature was {{convert|-7.5|C}} at Alice Springs on 12 July 1976.<ref name=\"weatherrecords\"/>\n\n{{-}}\n\n===Queensland===\n[[File:Queensland K\u00f6ppen.svg|thumb|400px|K\u00f6ppen map of Queensland]]\n\nBecause of its size, there is significant variation in climate across the state. Low rainfall and hot summers are typical for the inland west, a monsoonal 'wet' season in the far north, and warm [[Subtropics|subtropical]] conditions along the coastal strip. Inland and in southern ranges cooler temperatures are experienced, especially at nights. The climate of the coastal strip is influenced by warm ocean waters, keeping the region free from extremes of temperature and providing moisture for rainfall.<ref>[http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/96122/20090317-1643/www.bom.gov.au/lam/climate/levelthree/ausclim/ausclimqld.html BOM - Climate of Queensland]</ref>\n\nThere are five predominant climatic zones in Queensland,<ref>[http://www.bom.gov.au/cgi-bin/climate/cgi_bin_scripts/clim_classification.cgi BOM - Australian climatic zones]{{dead link|date=November 2016|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref> based on temperature and humidity:\n* hot humid summer (far north and coastal)\n* warm humid summer (coastal elevated hinterlands and coastal south-east)\n* hot dry summer, mild winter (central west)\n* hot dry summer, cold winter (southern west)\n* temperate \u2013 warm summer, cold winter (inland south-east, e.g. [[Granite Belt]])\n\n[[File:Kelsey Creek-Dittmer Mountains.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Grassland typical of Queensland and mountain ranges near [[Proserpine, Queensland|Proserpine]]]]\n\nHowever, most of the Queensland populace experience two weather seasons: a winter period of rather warm temperatures with minimal rainfall, and a sultry summer period of hot, sticky temperatures and more rain.\n\nThe highest maximum temperature observed in the state is {{convert|49.5|C}} at [[Birdsville]] on 24 December 1972.

Victoria}}\n\nVictoria has a varied climate despite its small size. It ranges from semi-arid and hot in the north-west, to temperate and cool along the coast. Victoria's main land feature, the [[Great Dividing Range]], produces a cooler, mountain climate in the centre of the state.\n\nVictoria's southernmost position on the Australian mainland means it is cooler and wetter than other mainland states and territories. The coastal plain south of the Great Dividing Range has Victoria's mildest climate. Air from the Southern Ocean helps reduce the heat of summer and the cold of winter. Melbourne and other large cities are located in this temperate region.\n\n[[Mallee (Victoria)|The Mallee]] and upper [[Wimmera]] are Victoria's warmest regions with hot winds blowing from nearby deserts. Average temperatures top {{convert|30|C|0}} during summer and {{convert|15|C|0}} in winter. Victoria's highest maximum temperature of {{convert|48.8|C|1}} was recorded in [[Hopetoun, Victoria|Hopetoun]] on 7 February 2009, during the 2009 south-eastern Australia heat wave.<ref name=\"weatherrecords\"/> A [[Stevenson screen|screen]] temperature of {{convert|50.7|C|1}} was recorded on 7 January 1906 in [[Mildura]].<ref>[http://www.sunraysiadaily.com.au/news/local/news/general/hopetoun-sizzles-as-mildura-sweats/1430009.aspx Hopetoun sizzles as Mildura sweats] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114112700/http://www.sunraysiadaily.com.au/news/local/news/general/hopetoun-sizzles-as-mildura-sweats/1430009.aspx|date=14 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/city-swelters-records-tumble-in-heat-20090207-80ai.html|location=Melbourne|work=The Age|title=City swelters, records tumble in heat|date=7 February 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Australian Alps|Victorian Alps]] in the north-east are the coldest part of Victoria. The Alps are part of the Great Dividing Range mountain system extending east-west through the centre of Victoria. Average temperatures are less than {{convert|9|C|0}} in winter and below {{convert|0|C|0}} in the highest parts of the ranges. The state's lowest minimum temperature of {{convert|-11.7|C|1}} was recorded at [[Omeo]] on 13 June 1965, and again at [[Falls Creek, Victoria|Falls Creek]] on 3 July 1970.<ref name=\"weatherrecords\"/>\n\nVictoria is the wettest Australian state after Tasmania. Rainfall in Victoria increases from north to south, with higher averages in areas of high altitude. Median annual rainfall exceeds {{convert|1800|mm|abbr=on|0}} in some parts of the north-east but is less than {{convert|250|mm|abbr=on|0}} in the Mallee.\n\nRain is heaviest in the [[Great Otway National Park|Otway Ranges]] and [[Gippsland]] in southern Victoria and in the mountainous north-east. Snow generally falls only in the mountains and hills in the centre of the state. Rain falls most frequently in winter, but summer precipitation is heavier. Rainfall is most reliable in Gippsland and the [[Western District (Victoria)|Western District]], making them both leading farming areas. Victoria's highest recorded daily rainfall was {{convert|375|mm}} at Tanybryn in the Otway Ranges on 22 March 1983.<ref name=\"weatherrecords\"/>\n\n[[File:Labelled map of Victoria for Climate of

This agricultural region of Western Australia is in the top nine terrestrial habitats for terrestrial [[biodiversity]], with a higher proportion of [[Endemism|endemic species]] than most other equivalent regions. Due to the offshore [[Leeuwin Current]], the area numbers in the top six regions for [[Marine biology|marine biodiversity]], containing the most southerly [[coral reef]]s in the world.\n\nAverage annual rainfall varies from {{convert|300|mm|abbr=on|0}} at the edge of the [[Wheatbelt (Western Australia)|Wheatbelt]] region to {{convert|1400|mm|abbr=on|0}} in the wettest areas near [[Northcliffe, Western Australia|Northcliffe]], the Southwestern most tip of Australia, but in the months of November to March, although rain still falls, evaporation exceeds rainfall and it is generally very dry. Plants must be adapted to this as well as the extreme poverty of all soils. A major reduction in rainfall has been observed, with a greater number of rainfall events in the summer months. The central four-fifths of the state is semi-arid or desert and is lightly inhabited with the only significant activity being mining. Annual rainfall averages about {{convert|200|to|250|mm|abbr=on|0}}, most of which occurs in sporadic torrential falls related to cyclone events in summer months.\n\nAn exception to this is the northern tropical regions. The [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley]] has an extremely hot monsoonal climate with average annual rainfall ranging from {{convert|500|to|1500|mm|abbr=on|0}}, but there is a very long dry season of 7 months from April to November. Eighty-five per cent of the state's [[Surface runoff|runoff]] occurs in the Kimberley, but because it occurs in violent floods and because of the insurmountable poverty of the generally shallow soils, development has only taken place along the [[Ord River]].\n[[File:Bush in Western Australia.jpg|left|thumb|240px|A [[chaparral]]-like bush land in the Mediterranean region of the state]]\nAustralia's [[Tropics|tropical]]/subtropical location and cold waters off the western coast make most of [[Western Australia]] a hot desert with aridity a marked feature of a greater part of the continent.

Cold snaps may bring frosts inland, though temperatures near the coast are mild or near mild all year round. Summers in southern Australia are generally dry and hot with coastal [[sea breeze]]s. During a lengthy dry spell, hot and dry [[wind]]s from the interior can cause bushfires in some southern and eastern states, though most commonly [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[New South Wales]].\n\nThe tropical areas of northern Australia have a wet summer because of the monsoon. During \"the wet\", typically October to April, humid north-westerly winds bring showers and thunderstorms. Occasionally, [[tropical cyclone]]s can bring heavy rainfall to tropical coastal regions, which is also likely to reach further inland. After the monsoonal season, the dry season comes (\"winter\"), which brings mostly clear skies and milder conditions.\n\nRainfall records tend to be concentrated along the east coast of Australia, particularly in tropical north Queensland.

Hence, rain clouds are sparsely formed and rarely do they form long enough for a continuous period of rain to be recorded. Australia's arid/semi-arid zone extends to this region. The absence of any significant mountain range or area of substantial height above sea level, results in very little rainfall caused by [[Orographic lift|orographic uplift]]. In the east the [[Great Dividing Range]] limits rain moving into inland Australia.\n\nAustralia has a compact shape, and no significant [[body of water|bodies of water]] penetrate very far inland. This is important in as much as moist winds are prevented from penetrating inland, so keeping rainfall low.<ref>[http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/96122/20090317-1643/www.bom.gov.au/lam/climate/levelthree/ausclim/zones.html Australia - Climate of Our Continent]</ref>\n\n===Snow===\n[[File:Arhs robertson 7344.jpg|thumb|right|Snow (a relatively rare occurrence in non-alpine regions of Australia) blankets the town of [[Robertson, New South Wales|Robertson]] causing the closure of various transport facilities including the Cockatoo Run (16 August 1996).]]\nIn Australia, [[snow]] falls frequently on the highlands near the east coast, in the states of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[New South Wales]] and [[Tasmania]] and in the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. There is a regular snow season in several areas which have seasonal [[Ski resort|ski tourism]] industries, such as [[Thredbo]], [[Cabramurra]], [[Mount Buller, Victoria|Mount Buller]] and [[Perisher Ski Resort]], among others. Snow also falls with some regularity on the [[Great Dividing Range]] as far north as [[Stanthorpe, Queensland|Stanthorpe]], Queensland and in isolated parts of [[South Australia]] and [[Western Australia]], but outside these areas, snow is an extremely rare occurrence. Snow has also fallen on [[Uluru]] and near [[Alice Springs]] on at least one occasion.\n\nSnow at sea level is occasionally recorded on mainland Australia, but is more frequent in Tasmania where snowfalls at sea level can occur during the winter months. Snow has been recorded across most of Tasmania, though it is rare on the northern coast at sea level. Snow is rare in the southernmost capitals like [[Melbourne]] and [[Hobart]], falling less than once every five years, and in the other capitals it is unknown (however snow has fallen in the hill suburbs of [[Perth]] and [[Adelaide]]). There are extensive, well-developed [[Skiing in Australia|ski fields]] in the Great Dividing Range, a few hours' drive from Melbourne and [[Sydney]]. Light snow generally falls every winter in Canberra, and other cities that may receive regular seasonal snowfalls include [[Orange, New South Wales|Orange]], [[Oberon, New South Wales|Oberon]], [[Lithgow, New South Wales|Lithgow]] and [[Katoomba, New South Wales|Katoomba]] in New South Wales.\n\nThe occasional cold snap, caused by cold air drifting north from Antarctica, can cause significant snowfall in rural areas, as well as major cities such as Hobart, Melbourne's outer mountain suburbs and [[Canberra]]. Such occasions are rare, but have occurred in 1958, 1965, 1986, 2005 and 2015, the 1965 event causing snow to fall as far north as [[Eungella National Park|Eungella]], near [[Mackay, Queensland|Mackay]] in tropical Queensland.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4139068.stm Heavy snow in southern Australia], ''[[BBC News]]'', 10 August 2005.</ref> Extreme snow events have also produced snow as far north-west as [[Longreach]] in Queensland and in the ranges near [[Alice Springs]], and also in lowland towns such as [[Dubbo]] and [[Wagga Wagga]] in New South Wales.

Summers are hot in most of the country with average January maximum temperatures exceeding 30&nbsp;\u00b0C over most of the mainland, except for high [[elevation]]s. Winters are warm in the north and cool in the south, with nightly frosts common in inland areas south of the [[Tropic of Capricorn]]. Only at the highly elevated areas do wintertime temperatures approach those found in much of [[Europe]] or [[North America]], especially the southern parts.\n\nTemperatures in Australia have followed an [[global warming|increasing trend]] between the years of 1910 to 2004 by approximately 0.7&nbsp;\u00b0C. Overnight minimum temperatures have warmed more rapidly than daytime maximum temperatures. The observed warming has hastened in recent years. The late-20th-century warming has been largely attributed to the increased [[greenhouse effect]].<ref>[http://www.abs.gov.au/Ausstats/abs@.nsf/94713ad445ff1425ca25682000192af2/bbd307d0202ca25bca2570de00032610!OpenDocument#CLIMATE%20CHANGE \"Statistics\" Australian gov't]</ref> Temperature differences between [[winter]] and [[summer]] are minor in the tropical region of Australia. However, they are greatest in the southern inland, with seasonal differences along the coast being moderated by the ocean's proximity. In July, a more common latitudinal distribution of average maximums is apparent, ranging from 30&nbsp;\u00b0C near the north coast to below 3&nbsp;\u00b0C in the mountainous areas of the south-east.<ref>[http://www.abs.gov.au/Ausstats/abs@.nsf/46d1bc47ac9d0c7bca256c470025ff87/BBD307D0202CA25BCA2570DE00032610?opendocument \"Statistics\" Australian Gov't]</ref>\n\nAverage minimum temperatures in all seasons are highest in northern Australia and near the coastal areas, and are lowest in the elevated areas of the south-east. The highest average January minimum temperatures (near 27&nbsp;\u00b0C) are found near the [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|north-west coast]], while in winter they exceed 20&nbsp;\u00b0C at some coastal locations in [[northern Australia]] and on the [[Torres Strait]] and [[Tiwi Islands]]. In the mountains of New South Wales, it is not unusual to have average low minimum temperatures dipping below 5&nbsp;\u00b0C in January and \u22125&nbsp;\u00b0C in July. Comparatively, most inland (non-mountainous) areas south of the tropics have average July minimum between 0 and 6&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\nIn the desert, the dry air and clear skies give rather large ranges in temperature between day and night. Ranges of 15&nbsp;\u00b0C being typical and 20&nbsp;\u00b0C not quite unusual. Light nighttime [[frost]]s in winter occur over much of the southern half of the arid zone, where mean July minimum temperatures are mostly in the 3 to 6&nbsp;\u00b0C range. Moving north, frosts become increasingly rare, with mean July minimum being around 10&nbsp;\u00b0C on the northern boundary.\n\nThe highest maximums in Australia are recorded in two regions, the [[Pilbara]] and [[Gascoyne]] regions of north-western Western Australia and the area extending from south-western [[Queensland]] across South Australia into south-eastern [[Western Australia]]. Many locations in this region have recorded temperatures exceeding 48&nbsp;\u00b0C. In January, average maximum temperatures exceed 35&nbsp;\u00b0C over a large area of the interior and exceed 40&nbsp;\u00b0C over areas in the north-west. The highest summer maximums in the Pilbara and Gascoyne average at around 41&nbsp;\u00b0C (in some years daily maximums consecutively exceed 40&nbsp;\u00b0C for several weeks at a time).\n\n===Extremes===\n{{see also|List of weather records}}\n[[file:Karijini1.jpg|thumb|260px|right|[[Marble Bar, Western Australia|Marble Bar]] set a world record of most consecutive days of maximum temperatures above 37.8\u00b0 Celsius (100 degrees Fahrenheit).]]\n\nThe most powerful [[heatwave]] in the history of south-eastern Australia occurred in January 1939. Adelaide (46.1&nbsp;\u00b0C on the 12th), Melbourne (45.6&nbsp;\u00b0C on the 13th) and Sydney (45.3&nbsp;\u00b0C on the 14th) all had record-high temperatures during this period, as did many other central district areas in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. The record number of consecutive days in [[Melbourne]] over 40&nbsp;\u00b0C is five, with [[Brisbane]] and [[Sydney]] each having two. Heatwaves usually bring by oppressively warm nights, with [[Oodnadatta]], SA recording an Australian record of nine nights above 30&nbsp;\u00b0C in February 2004.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20001211200600/http://www.bom.gov.au/lam/climate/levelthree/c20thc/temp1.htm]</ref> Another extreme event was a prolonged period of extensive heatwaves known as the [[Angry Summer]] in early 2013.\n\n[[Marble Bar]] achieved 160 consecutive days above {{Convert|37.8|C}} in 1923\u201324. [[Nyang Station|Nyang]] had an average maximum of 44.8&nbsp;\u00b0C for the months of February 1998 and January 2005, an Australian record. At the other extreme, average January maximums are near 15&nbsp;\u00b0C on the highest peaks of the south-east ranges and near 20&nbsp;\u00b0C in much of [[Tasmania]]. In most of the desert region during summer, cool days are rare and usually associated with major rain events\u2014a rather exceptional example occurred in February 1949, when many areas failed to reach 20&nbsp;\u00b0C on one or more days, and the maximum at [[Boulia]], [[western Queensland]] was at 14.4&nbsp;\u00b0C, which was 23&nbsp;\u00b0C below normal.\n\nMany other locations in Australia, except those above 500 metres, have extreme maximums between 43 and 48&nbsp;\u00b0C. Most Tasmanian sites away from the north coast have had extreme maximums between 35 and 40&nbsp;\u00b0C. The lowest extreme maximums are found along the north coast of Tasmania (e.g. 29.5&nbsp;\u00b0C at [[Low Head]]) and at high elevations (27.0&nbsp;\u00b0C at [[Thredbo]]). While extreme high temperatures are more common inland than they are near the coast, notable extreme maximum have been observed near the coast; 50.5&nbsp;\u00b0C at [[Mardie Station|Mardie]], 49.1&nbsp;\u00b0C at [[Roebourne, Western Australia]], 48.5&nbsp;\u00b0C at [[Whyalla]] and 48.4&nbsp;\u00b0C at [[Ceduna, South Australia]].\n\nAt lower elevations, most inland places south of the tropics have extreme minimum between \u22123 and \u22127&nbsp;\u00b0C, and these low temperatures have also occurred in locations within a few kilometres of southern and eastern coasts, such as [[Sale, Victoria]] (\u22125.6&nbsp;\u00b0C), [[Bega, New South Wales]] (\u22128.1&nbsp;\u00b0C), [[Grove, Tasmania]] (\u22127.5&nbsp;\u00b0C) and [[Taree]], New South Wales (\u22125.0&nbsp;\u00b0C). Many locations in this region have recorded \u221210&nbsp;\u00b0C or lower, including Gudgenby in the Australian Capital Territory (\u221214.6&nbsp;\u00b0C) and [[Woolbrook, New South Wales]] (\u221214.5&nbsp;\u00b0C). In the desert, the lowest extreme minimum occur at high elevations, especially around [[Alice Springs]], where the temperature has fallen as low as \u22127.5&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\nIn the tropics, extreme minimum near or below 0&nbsp;\u00b0C have occurred at many places distant from the coast, as far north as [[Herberton, Queensland]] (\u22125.0&nbsp;\u00b0C).

Australia's high incidence of bushfires, particularly during the summer months. Low [[relative humidity]], wind and lack of rain can cause a small fire, either man-made or caused by [[lightning strike]]s, to spread rapidly. Low humidity, the heat of the sun and lack of water cause vegetation to dry out becoming a perfect fuel for the fire. High winds fan the flames, increasing their intensity and the speed and distance at which they can travel.<ref>[http://www.bom.gov.au/inside/services_policy/fire_ag/bushfire/wandfire.htm Weather and Fire], BOM.

When blizzards do occur, they can affect the Tasmanian Highlands and, particularly, [[Mount Wellington (Tasmania)|Mount Wellington]], which towers over the Tasmanian capital Hobart. Blizzards do not affect any major towns or cities, because there are no populated areas located in the mountains except for the ski resort towns of New South Wales and Victoria.\n\n===Dust storms===\n{{See also|2009 Australian dust storm}}\nA dust storm or sandstorm, a meteorological phenomenon common in arid and semi-arid regions, arises when a gust front passes or when the wind force exceeds the threshold value where loose sand and [[dust]] are removed from the dry surface. Particles are transported by [[Saltation (geology)|saltation]] and suspension, causing soil [[erosion]] from one place and [[Deposition (geology)|deposition]] in another.\n\n''Sandstorm'' usually refers to dust storms in desert areas when, in addition to fine particles obscuring visibility, a considerable amount of larger sand particles moves closer to the surface. The term ''dust storm'' is more likely to be used when finer particles are blown long distances, especially when the dust storm affects [[urban area]]s.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Australia}}\n* [[Indigenous Australian seasons]]\n* [[List of wettest tropical cyclones by country#Australia|List of wettest known tropical cyclones in Australia]]\n* [[Weather extremes in Australia]], an index of extreme Australian weather articles\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Climate of Australia}}\n*[http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/ Australian Bureau of Meteorology \u2013 Climate Information]\n*[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-07-09/100-years-of-temperatures/5582146 Interactive: 100 years of temperatures in Australia \u2013 ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)]\n*[http://www.bushmantanks.com.au/100-years-of-australian-rainfall Interactive: 100 years of rainfall in Australia]\n\n{{Oceania topic|Climate of}}\n\n{{Australia topics}}\n\n[[Category:Climate of Australia]]\n[[Category:Climate by country|Australia]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use Australian English|date=February 2019}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2020}}\n'''Australia's climate''' is governed mostly by its size and by the hot, sinking air of the [[Subtropics|subtropical]] [[high pressure]] belt. This moves north-west and north-east with the [[season]]s. The climate is variable, with frequent droughts lasting several seasons, thought to be caused in part by the [[El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation]]. Australia has a wide variety of climates due to its large geographical size. The largest part of [[Australia]] is [[desert]] or [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]]. Only the south-east and south-west corners have a [[temperate climate]] and moderately [[Soil fertility|fertile soil]]. The northern part of the country has a [[tropical climate]], varying between [[grassland]]s and desert. Australia holds many heat-related records: the continent has the hottest extended region year-round, the areas with the hottest summer climate, and the highest sunshine duration.\n\nBecause Australia is a medium-sized continent, separated from polar regions by the [[Southern Ocean]], it is not subject to movements of frigid polar air during winter, of the type that sweep over the continents in the northern hemisphere during their winter. Consequently, Australia's winter is relatively mild, with less contrast between summer and winter temperatures than in the northern continents. Seasonal highs and lows can still be considerable. Temperatures have ranged from above {{convert|53|C}} to well below {{convert|0|C}}. Minimum temperatures are moderated.\n\nThe El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation is associated with seasonal abnormality in many areas in the world. Australia is one of the continents most affected and experiences [[Drought in Australia|extensive drought]]s alongside considerable wet periods. Occasionally a [[dust storm]] will blanket a region and there are reports of the occasional [[tornado]]. Tropical cyclones, [[heat wave]]s, [[Bushfires in Australia|bushfire]]s and [[frost]]s in the country are also associated with the Southern Oscillation. Rising levels of [[salinity]] and [[desertification]] in some areas is ravaging the landscape.\n\n[[Climate change in Australia]] is a highly contentious political issue.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/30/science/earth/human-related-climate-change-led-to-extreme-heat-scientists-say.html ''Scientists Trace Extreme Heat in Australia to Climate Change''] 29 September 2014 NYT</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=State of the Climate 2014|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/state-of-the-climate/|work=Bureau of Meteorology|accessdate=29 March 2014}}</ref> Temperatures in the country rose by approximately 0.7&nbsp;\u00b0C between 1910 and 2004, following an [[global warming|increasing trend of global warming]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2014/s3956656.htm|title=CSIRO report says Australia getting hotter with more to come|work=ABC Online|date=4 March 2014|accessdate=20 April 2014}}</ref> Overnight minimum temperatures have warmed more rapidly than daytime maximum temperatures in recent years.

The eastern portion has a [[temperate climate]], ranging from [[Humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]] from its northern border to the [[Central Coast (New South Wales)|Central Coast]] and most of Sydney, and [[oceanic climate|oceanic]] to the south coast. The [[Snowy Mountains]] region in the south-east falls in the [[alpine climate]] or [[subpolar oceanic climate]] zone, with cool to cold weather all year around and snowfalls in the winter. Further inland, the climate is semi-arid and a [[desert climate]] towards the western part of the state.\n\nThe weather in the southern half of the state is generally warm to hot in summer and cool in the winter. The seasons are more defined in the southern half of the state, especially in the [[South West Slopes]], [[Central West (New South Wales)|Central West]] and the [[Riverina]] regions. Rainfall usually peaks in the summer in most of parts of the state, though the Riverina region, which is in the southern-central part of the state, bordering [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], has drier summers and a winter rainfall peak. On a hot summer day, a [[southerly buster]] may at times moderate the extreme heat experienced in the coastal New South Wales region, from [[Port Macquarie]] southwards to [[Nowra]].<ref>[http://www.bom.gov.au/social/2011/10/southerly-busters/ Southerly Busters Explained]. The Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology. Accessed 21 February 2012.</ref>\n\nThe warmest region is the [[Far West (New South Wales)|north-west]], where summers are very hot, and winters cooler and drier. The weather in the [[Northern Rivers|northeast region]] of the state, or the [[New South Wales North Coast|North Coast]], bordering [[Queensland]], is hot and humid in the summer, with a rainfall peak, and mild in winter with more sunshine, and little seasonal temperature difference. The [[Northern Tablelands]] have relatively mild summers and cold winters, due to their high elevation in the [[Great Dividing Range]].\n\nThe coldest region is the [[Snowy Mountains]] where the snow and frost continues for a long period during the winter months. The [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]], [[Southern Tablelands]] and [[Central Tablelands]], which are situated on the Great Dividing Range, have mild to warm summers and cold winters, although not as severe as those in the Snowy Mountains. Some areas situated in or around the range, such as [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]], [[Goulburn, New South Wales|Goulburn]] and [[Bowral, New South Wales|Bowral]], among other places, have recorded freezing and/or near-freezing lows in most months of the year, unlike other places of similar latitude and altitude in the northern hemisphere.\n\nThe highest maximum temperature recorded was {{convert|49.8|C}} at [[Menindee, New South Wales|Menindee]] in the state's west on 10 January 1939. The lowest minimum temperature was {{convert|-23.0|C}} at [[Charlotte Pass, New South Wales|Charlotte Pass]] on 29 June 1994 in the Snowy Mountains. This is also the lowest temperature recorded in the whole of Australia excluding [[Australian Antarctic Territory]].<ref name=\"weatherrecords\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/extreme/records/national.pdf|title=Rainfall and Temperature Records: National|publisher=Bureau of Meteorology (BOM)|accessdate=17 November 2009|format=PDF}}</ref>\n\nRainfall varies throughout the state.

During the dry season nearly every day is warm and sunny, and afternoon humidity averages around 30%. There is very little rainfall between May and September. In the coolest months of June and July, the daily minimum temperature may dip as low as {{convert|14|C}}, but very rarely lower, and frost has never been recorded.\n\nThe wet season is associated with [[tropical cyclone]]s and monsoon rains. The majority of rainfall occurs between December and March (the [[Southern Hemisphere]] summer), when thunderstorms are common and afternoon relative humidity averages over 70% during the wettest months. On average more than {{convert|1570|mm|abbr=on}} of rain falls in the north. Thunderstorms can produce spectacular [[lightning]] displays.\n\n[[File:Evening monsoonal squall.jpg|thumb|left|Monsoonal squall nears Darwin]]\nThe rest of the territory lies in the desert centre of the country; it includes [[Alice Springs]] and [[Uluru]], and is arid or semi-arid with little rain usually falling during the hottest months from October to March. Its seasons are more defined than the northern parts, with summers being very hot, with average temperatures often exceeding {{convert|35|C}}, and winters relatively cool with average minimum temperatures dipping as low as {{convert|5|C}}, with a few frosty nights. [[Central Australia]] receives less than {{convert|250|mm|0|abbr=on}} of annual rainfall.\n\nThe highest maximum temperature recorded in the territory was {{convert|48.3|C}} at [[Aputula|Finke]] on 1 and 2 January 1960.

Low rainfall and hot summers are typical for the inland west, a monsoonal 'wet' season in the far north, and warm [[Subtropics|subtropical]] conditions along the coastal strip. Inland and in southern ranges cooler temperatures are experienced, especially at nights. The climate of the coastal strip is influenced by warm ocean waters, keeping the region free from extremes of temperature and providing moisture for rainfall.<ref>[http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/96122/20090317-1643/www.bom.gov.au/lam/climate/levelthree/ausclim/ausclimqld.html BOM - Climate of Queensland]</ref>\n\nThere are five predominant climatic zones in Queensland,<ref>[http://www.bom.gov.au/cgi-bin/climate/cgi_bin_scripts/clim_classification.cgi BOM - Australian climatic zones]{{dead link|date=November 2016|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref> based on temperature and humidity:\n* hot humid summer (far north and coastal)\n* warm humid summer (coastal elevated hinterlands and coastal south-east)\n* hot dry summer, mild winter (central west)\n* hot dry summer, cold winter (southern west)\n* temperate \u2013 warm summer, cold winter (inland south-east, e.g. [[Granite Belt]])\n\n[[File:Kelsey Creek-Dittmer Mountains.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Grassland typical of Queensland and mountain ranges near [[Proserpine, Queensland|Proserpine]]]]\n\nHowever, most of the Queensland populace experience two weather seasons: a winter period of rather warm temperatures with minimal rainfall, and a sultry summer period of hot, sticky temperatures and more rain.\n\nThe highest maximum temperature observed in the state is {{convert|49.5|C}} at [[Birdsville]] on 24 December 1972.

Victoria}}\n\nVictoria has a varied climate despite its small size. It ranges from semi-arid and hot in the north-west, to temperate and cool along the coast. Victoria's main land feature, the [[Great Dividing Range]], produces a cooler, mountain climate in the centre of the state.\n\nVictoria's southernmost position on the Australian mainland means it is cooler and wetter than other mainland states and territories. The coastal plain south of the Great Dividing Range has Victoria's mildest climate. Air from the Southern Ocean helps reduce the heat of summer and the cold of winter. Melbourne and other large cities are located in this temperate region.\n\n[[Mallee (Victoria)|The Mallee]] and upper [[Wimmera]] are Victoria's warmest regions with hot winds blowing from nearby deserts. Average temperatures top {{convert|30|C|0}} during summer and {{convert|15|C|0}} in winter. Victoria's highest maximum temperature of {{convert|48.8|C|1}} was recorded in [[Hopetoun, Victoria|Hopetoun]] on 7 February 2009, during the 2009 south-eastern Australia heat wave.<ref name=\"weatherrecords\"/> A [[Stevenson screen|screen]] temperature of {{convert|50.7|C|1}} was recorded on 7 January 1906 in [[Mildura]].<ref>[http://www.sunraysiadaily.com.au/news/local/news/general/hopetoun-sizzles-as-mildura-sweats/1430009.aspx Hopetoun sizzles as Mildura sweats] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114112700/http://www.sunraysiadaily.com.au/news/local/news/general/hopetoun-sizzles-as-mildura-sweats/1430009.aspx|date=14 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/city-swelters-records-tumble-in-heat-20090207-80ai.html|location=Melbourne|work=The Age|title=City swelters, records tumble in heat|date=7 February 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Australian Alps|Victorian Alps]] in the north-east are the coldest part of Victoria. The Alps are part of the Great Dividing Range mountain system extending east-west through the centre of Victoria. Average temperatures are less than {{convert|9|C|0}} in winter and below {{convert|0|C|0}} in the highest parts of the ranges. The state's lowest minimum temperature of {{convert|-11.7|C|1}} was recorded at [[Omeo]] on 13 June 1965, and again at [[Falls Creek, Victoria|Falls Creek]] on 3 July 1970.<ref name=\"weatherrecords\"/>\n\nVictoria is the wettest Australian state after Tasmania. Rainfall in Victoria increases from north to south, with higher averages in areas of high altitude. Median annual rainfall exceeds {{convert|1800|mm|abbr=on|0}} in some parts of the north-east but is less than {{convert|250|mm|abbr=on|0}} in the Mallee.\n\nRain is heaviest in the [[Great Otway National Park|Otway Ranges]] and [[Gippsland]] in southern Victoria and in the mountainous north-east. Snow generally falls only in the mountains and hills in the centre of the state. Rain falls most frequently in winter, but summer precipitation is heavier. Rainfall is most reliable in Gippsland and the [[Western District (Victoria)|Western District]], making them both leading farming areas. Victoria's highest recorded daily rainfall was {{convert|375|mm}} at Tanybryn in the Otway Ranges on 22 March 1983.<ref name=\"weatherrecords\"/>\n\n[[File:Labelled map of Victoria for Climate of

Due to the offshore [[Leeuwin Current]], the area numbers in the top six regions for [[Marine biology|marine biodiversity]], containing the most southerly [[coral reef]]s in the world.\n\nAverage annual rainfall varies from {{convert|300|mm|abbr=on|0}} at the edge of the [[Wheatbelt (Western Australia)|Wheatbelt]] region to {{convert|1400|mm|abbr=on|0}} in the wettest areas near [[Northcliffe, Western Australia|Northcliffe]], the Southwestern most tip of Australia, but in the months of November to March, although rain still falls, evaporation exceeds rainfall and it is generally very dry. Plants must be adapted to this as well as the extreme poverty of all soils. A major reduction in rainfall has been observed, with a greater number of rainfall events in the summer months. The central four-fifths of the state is semi-arid or desert and is lightly inhabited with the only significant activity being mining. Annual rainfall averages about {{convert|200|to|250|mm|abbr=on|0}}, most of which occurs in sporadic torrential falls related to cyclone events in summer months.\n\nAn exception to this is the northern tropical regions. The [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley]] has an extremely hot monsoonal climate with average annual rainfall ranging from {{convert|500|to|1500|mm|abbr=on|0}}, but there is a very long dry season of 7 months from April to November. Eighty-five per cent of the state's [[Surface runoff|runoff]] occurs in the Kimberley, but because it occurs in violent floods and because of the insurmountable poverty of the generally shallow soils, development has only taken place along the [[Ord River]].\n[[File:Bush in Western Australia.jpg|left|thumb|240px|A [[chaparral]]-like bush land in the Mediterranean region of the state]]\nAustralia's [[Tropics|tropical]]/subtropical location and cold waters off the western coast make most of [[Western Australia]] a hot desert with aridity a marked feature of a greater part of the continent.

Cold snaps may bring frosts inland, though temperatures near the coast are mild or near mild all year round. Summers in southern Australia are generally dry and hot with coastal [[sea breeze]]s. During a lengthy dry spell, hot and dry [[wind]]s from the interior can cause bushfires in some southern and eastern states, though most commonly [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[New South Wales]].\n\nThe tropical areas of northern Australia have a wet summer because of the monsoon. During \"the wet\", typically October to April, humid north-westerly winds bring showers and thunderstorms. Occasionally, [[tropical cyclone]]s can bring heavy rainfall to tropical coastal regions, which is also likely to reach further inland. After the monsoonal season, the dry season comes (\"winter\"), which brings mostly clear skies and milder conditions.\n\nRainfall records tend to be concentrated along the east coast of Australia, particularly in tropical north Queensland.

Hence, rain clouds are sparsely formed and rarely do they form long enough for a continuous period of rain to be recorded. Australia's arid/semi-arid zone extends to this region. The absence of any significant mountain range or area of substantial height above sea level, results in very little rainfall caused by [[Orographic lift|orographic uplift]]. In the east the [[Great Dividing Range]] limits rain moving into inland Australia.\n\nAustralia has a compact shape, and no significant [[body of water|bodies of water]] penetrate very far inland. This is important in as much as moist winds are prevented from penetrating inland, so keeping rainfall low.<ref>[http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/96122/20090317-1643/www.bom.gov.au/lam/climate/levelthree/ausclim/zones.html Australia - Climate of Our Continent]</ref>\n\n===Snow===\n[[File:Arhs robertson 7344.jpg|thumb|right|Snow (a relatively rare occurrence in non-alpine regions of Australia) blankets the town of [[Robertson, New South Wales|Robertson]] causing the closure of various transport facilities including the Cockatoo Run (16 August 1996).]]\nIn Australia, [[snow]] falls frequently on the highlands near the east coast, in the states of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[New South Wales]] and [[Tasmania]] and in the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. There is a regular snow season in several areas which have seasonal [[Ski resort|ski tourism]] industries, such as [[Thredbo]], [[Cabramurra]], [[Mount Buller, Victoria|Mount Buller]] and [[Perisher Ski Resort]], among others. Snow also falls with some regularity on the [[Great Dividing Range]] as far north as [[Stanthorpe, Queensland|Stanthorpe]], Queensland and in isolated parts of [[South Australia]] and [[Western Australia]], but outside these areas, snow is an extremely rare occurrence. Snow has also fallen on [[Uluru]] and near [[Alice Springs]] on at least one occasion.\n\nSnow at sea level is occasionally recorded on mainland Australia, but is more frequent in Tasmania where snowfalls at sea level can occur during the winter months. Snow has been recorded across most of Tasmania, though it is rare on the northern coast at sea level. Snow is rare in the southernmost capitals like [[Melbourne]] and [[Hobart]], falling less than once every five years, and in the other capitals it is unknown (however snow has fallen in the hill suburbs of [[Perth]] and [[Adelaide]]). There are extensive, well-developed [[Skiing in Australia|ski fields]] in the Great Dividing Range, a few hours' drive from Melbourne and [[Sydney]]. Light snow generally falls every winter in Canberra, and other cities that may receive regular seasonal snowfalls include [[Orange, New South Wales|Orange]], [[Oberon, New South Wales|Oberon]], [[Lithgow, New South Wales|Lithgow]] and [[Katoomba, New South Wales|Katoomba]] in New South Wales.\n\nThe occasional cold snap, caused by cold air drifting north from Antarctica, can cause significant snowfall in rural areas, as well as major cities such as Hobart, Melbourne's outer mountain suburbs and [[Canberra]]. Such occasions are rare, but have occurred in 1958, 1965, 1986, 2005 and 2015, the 1965 event causing snow to fall as far north as [[Eungella National Park|Eungella]], near [[Mackay, Queensland|Mackay]] in tropical Queensland.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4139068.stm Heavy snow in southern Australia], ''[[BBC News]]'', 10 August 2005.</ref> Extreme snow events have also produced snow as far north-west as [[Longreach]] in Queensland and in the ranges near [[Alice Springs]], and also in lowland towns such as [[Dubbo]] and [[Wagga Wagga]] in New South Wales.

The monsoon climate of northern Australia is hot and humid in summer.]]\nThe tropical [[savanna]]h zone of Northern Australia is warm to hot all year. Summers are hot in most of the country with average January maximum temperatures exceeding 30&nbsp;\u00b0C over most of the mainland, except for high [[elevation]]s. Winters are warm in the north and cool in the south, with nightly frosts common in inland areas south of the [[Tropic of Capricorn]]. Only at the highly elevated areas do wintertime temperatures approach those found in much of [[Europe]] or [[North America]], especially the southern parts.\n\nTemperatures in Australia have followed an [[global warming|increasing trend]] between the years of 1910 to 2004 by approximately 0.7&nbsp;\u00b0C. Overnight minimum temperatures have warmed more rapidly than daytime maximum temperatures. The observed warming has hastened in recent years. The late-20th-century warming has been largely attributed to the increased [[greenhouse effect]].<ref>[http://www.abs.gov.au/Ausstats/abs@.nsf/94713ad445ff1425ca25682000192af2/bbd307d0202ca25bca2570de00032610!OpenDocument#CLIMATE%20CHANGE \"Statistics\" Australian gov't]</ref> Temperature differences between [[winter]] and [[summer]] are minor in the tropical region of Australia. However, they are greatest in the southern inland, with seasonal differences along the coast being moderated by the ocean's proximity. In July, a more common latitudinal distribution of average maximums is apparent, ranging from 30&nbsp;\u00b0C near the north coast to below 3&nbsp;\u00b0C in the mountainous areas of the south-east.<ref>[http://www.abs.gov.au/Ausstats/abs@.nsf/46d1bc47ac9d0c7bca256c470025ff87/BBD307D0202CA25BCA2570DE00032610?opendocument \"Statistics\" Australian Gov't]</ref>\n\nAverage minimum temperatures in all seasons are highest in northern Australia and near the coastal areas, and are lowest in the elevated areas of the south-east. The highest average January minimum temperatures (near 27&nbsp;\u00b0C) are found near the [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|north-west coast]], while in winter they exceed 20&nbsp;\u00b0C at some coastal locations in [[northern Australia]] and on the [[Torres Strait]] and [[Tiwi Islands]]. In the mountains of New South Wales, it is not unusual to have average low minimum temperatures dipping below 5&nbsp;\u00b0C in January and \u22125&nbsp;\u00b0C in July. Comparatively, most inland (non-mountainous) areas south of the tropics have average July minimum between 0 and 6&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\nIn the desert, the dry air and clear skies give rather large ranges in temperature between day and night. Ranges of 15&nbsp;\u00b0C being typical and 20&nbsp;\u00b0C not quite unusual. Light nighttime [[frost]]s in winter occur over much of the southern half of the arid zone, where mean July minimum temperatures are mostly in the 3 to 6&nbsp;\u00b0C range. Moving north, frosts become increasingly rare, with mean July minimum being around 10&nbsp;\u00b0C on the northern boundary.\n\nThe highest maximums in Australia are recorded in two regions, the [[Pilbara]] and [[Gascoyne]] regions of north-western Western Australia and the area extending from south-western [[Queensland]] across South Australia into south-eastern [[Western Australia]]. Many locations in this region have recorded temperatures exceeding 48&nbsp;\u00b0C. In January, average maximum temperatures exceed 35&nbsp;\u00b0C over a large area of the interior and exceed 40&nbsp;\u00b0C over areas in the north-west. The highest summer maximums in the Pilbara and Gascoyne average at around 41&nbsp;\u00b0C (in some years daily maximums consecutively exceed 40&nbsp;\u00b0C for several weeks at a time).\n\n===Extremes===\n{{see also|List of weather records}}\n[[file:Karijini1.jpg|thumb|260px|right|[[Marble Bar, Western Australia|Marble Bar]] set a world record of most consecutive days of maximum temperatures above 37.8\u00b0 Celsius (100 degrees Fahrenheit).]]\n\nThe most powerful [[heatwave]] in the history of south-eastern Australia occurred in January 1939. Adelaide (46.1&nbsp;\u00b0C on the 12th), Melbourne (45.6&nbsp;\u00b0C on the 13th) and Sydney (45.3&nbsp;\u00b0C on the 14th) all had record-high temperatures during this period, as did many other central district areas in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. The record number of consecutive days in [[Melbourne]] over 40&nbsp;\u00b0C is five, with [[Brisbane]] and [[Sydney]] each having two. Heatwaves usually bring by oppressively warm nights, with [[Oodnadatta]], SA recording an Australian record of nine nights above 30&nbsp;\u00b0C in February 2004.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20001211200600/http://www.bom.gov.au/lam/climate/levelthree/c20thc/temp1.htm]</ref> Another extreme event was a prolonged period of extensive heatwaves known as the [[Angry Summer]] in early 2013.\n\n[[Marble Bar]] achieved 160 consecutive days above {{Convert|37.8|C}} in 1923\u201324. [[Nyang Station|Nyang]] had an average maximum of 44.8&nbsp;\u00b0C for the months of February 1998 and January 2005, an Australian record. At the other extreme, average January maximums are near 15&nbsp;\u00b0C on the highest peaks of the south-east ranges and near 20&nbsp;\u00b0C in much of [[Tasmania]]. In most of the desert region during summer, cool days are rare and usually associated with major rain events\u2014a rather exceptional example occurred in February 1949, when many areas failed to reach 20&nbsp;\u00b0C on one or more days, and the maximum at [[Boulia]], [[western Queensland]] was at 14.4&nbsp;\u00b0C, which was 23&nbsp;\u00b0C below normal.\n\nMany other locations in Australia, except those above 500 metres, have extreme maximums between 43 and 48&nbsp;\u00b0C. Most Tasmanian sites away from the north coast have had extreme maximums between 35 and 40&nbsp;\u00b0C. The lowest extreme maximums are found along the north coast of Tasmania (e.g. 29.5&nbsp;\u00b0C at [[Low Head]]) and at high elevations (27.0&nbsp;\u00b0C at [[Thredbo]]). While extreme high temperatures are more common inland than they are near the coast, notable extreme maximum have been observed near the coast; 50.5&nbsp;\u00b0C at [[Mardie Station|Mardie]], 49.1&nbsp;\u00b0C at [[Roebourne, Western Australia]], 48.5&nbsp;\u00b0C at [[Whyalla]] and 48.4&nbsp;\u00b0C at [[Ceduna, South Australia]].\n\nAt lower elevations, most inland places south of the tropics have extreme minimum between \u22123 and \u22127&nbsp;\u00b0C, and these low temperatures have also occurred in locations within a few kilometres of southern and eastern coasts, such as [[Sale, Victoria]] (\u22125.6&nbsp;\u00b0C), [[Bega, New South Wales]] (\u22128.1&nbsp;\u00b0C), [[Grove, Tasmania]] (\u22127.5&nbsp;\u00b0C) and [[Taree]], New South Wales (\u22125.0&nbsp;\u00b0C). Many locations in this region have recorded \u221210&nbsp;\u00b0C or lower, including Gudgenby in the Australian Capital Territory (\u221214.6&nbsp;\u00b0C) and [[Woolbrook, New South Wales]] (\u221214.5&nbsp;\u00b0C). In the desert, the lowest extreme minimum occur at high elevations, especially around [[Alice Springs]], where the temperature has fallen as low as \u22127.5&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\nIn the tropics, extreme minimum near or below 0&nbsp;\u00b0C have occurred at many places distant from the coast, as far north as [[Herberton, Queensland]] (\u22125.0&nbsp;\u00b0C). Some locations near tropical coasts, such as [[Mackay, Queensland|Mackay]] (\u22120.8&nbsp;\u00b0C), [[Townsville]] (0.1&nbsp;\u00b0C) and [[Kalumburu, Western Australia]] (0.3&nbsp;\u00b0C) have also recorded temperatures near 0&nbsp;\u00b0C. In contrast, some coastal locations, such as [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], have never fallen below 10&nbsp;\u00b0C, and [[Thursday Island]], in the Torres Strait, has an extreme minimum of 16.1&nbsp;\u00b0C.

Australia's high incidence of bushfires, particularly during the summer months. Low [[relative humidity]], wind and lack of rain can cause a small fire, either man-made or caused by [[lightning strike]]s, to spread rapidly. Low humidity, the heat of the sun and lack of water cause vegetation to dry out becoming a perfect fuel for the fire. High winds fan the flames, increasing their intensity and the speed and distance at which they can travel.<ref>[http://www.bom.gov.au/inside/services_policy/fire_ag/bushfire/wandfire.htm Weather and Fire], BOM.

In 1899, B. H. Hite was the first to conclusively demonstrate the inactivation of microorganisms by pressure. After he reported the effects of high pressure on microorganisms, reports on the effects of pressure on foods quickly followed. Hite tried to prevent milk from spoiling, and his work showed that microorganisms can be deactivated by subjecting it to high pressure. He also mentioned some advantages of pressure-treating foods, such as the lack of [[antiseptic]]s and no change in taste.<ref name=\"Hendrickx 13\">{{harvnb|Hendrickx|Knorr|2002|p=13}}</ref>\n\nHite said that, since 1897, a chemist at the West Virginia Agricultural Experimental Station had been studying the relationship between pressure and the preservation of meats, juices, and milk. Early experiments involved inserting a large screw into a cylinder and keeping it there for several days, but this did not have any effect in stopping the milk from spoiling. Later, a more powerful apparatus was able to subject the milk to higher pressures, and the treated milk was reported to stay sweeter for 24\u201360 hours longer than untreated milk. When {{convert|90|ST|MT}} of pressure was applied to samples of milk for one hour, they stayed sweet for one week. Unfortunately, the device used to induce pressure was later damaged when researchers tried to test its effects on other products.<ref name=\"Hendrickx 14\" />\n\nExperiments were also performed with [[anthrax]], [[typhoid]], and [[tuberculosis]], which was a potential health risk for the researchers. Indeed, before the process was improved, one employee of the Experimental Station became ill with typhoid fever.<ref name=\"Hendrickx 14\">{{harvnb|Hendrickx|Knorr|2002|p=14}}</ref>\n\nThe process that Hite reported on was not feasible for widespread use and did not always completely sterilize the milk. While more extensive investigations followed, the original study into milk was largely discontinued due to concerns over its effectiveness. Hite mentioned \"certain slow changes in the milk\" related to \"enzymes that the pressure could not destroy\".<ref name=\"Hendrickx 14/15\">{{harvnb|Hendrickx|Knorr|2002|pp=14\u201315}}</ref>\n\n===Early 1900s===\nHite et al. released a more detailed report on pressure sterilization in 1914, which included the number of microorganisms that remained in a product after treatment. Experiments were conducted on various other foods, including fruits, fruit juices, and some vegetables. They were met with mixed success, similar to the results obtained from the earlier tests on milk. While some foods were preserved, others were not, possibly due to bacterial spores that had not been killed.<ref name=\"Hendrickx 15\">{{harvnb|Hendrickx|Knorr|2002|p=15}}</ref>\n\nHite's 1914 investigation led to other studies into the effect of pressure on microorganisms. In 1918, a study published by W. P. Larson et al. was intended to help advance [[vaccine]]s.

In 1899, B. H. Hite was the first to conclusively demonstrate the inactivation of microorganisms by pressure. After he reported the effects of high pressure on microorganisms, reports on the effects of pressure on foods quickly followed. Hite tried to prevent milk from spoiling, and his work showed that microorganisms can be deactivated by subjecting it to high pressure. He also mentioned some advantages of pressure-treating foods, such as the lack of [[antiseptic]]s and no change in taste.<ref name=\"Hendrickx 13\">{{harvnb|Hendrickx|Knorr|2002|p=13}}</ref>\n\nHite said that, since 1897, a chemist at the West Virginia Agricultural Experimental Station had been studying the relationship between pressure and the preservation of meats, juices, and milk. Early experiments involved inserting a large screw into a cylinder and keeping it there for several days, but this did not have any effect in stopping the milk from spoiling. Later, a more powerful apparatus was able to subject the milk to higher pressures, and the treated milk was reported to stay sweeter for 24\u201360 hours longer than untreated milk. When {{convert|90|ST|MT}} of pressure was applied to samples of milk for one hour, they stayed sweet for one week.

While more extensive investigations followed, the original study into milk was largely discontinued due to concerns over its effectiveness. Hite mentioned \"certain slow changes in the milk\" related to \"enzymes that the pressure could not destroy\".<ref name=\"Hendrickx 14/15\">{{harvnb|Hendrickx|Knorr|2002|pp=14\u201315}}</ref>\n\n===Early 1900s===\nHite et al. released a more detailed report on pressure sterilization in 1914, which included the number of microorganisms that remained in a product after treatment.

As a result, high pressure treatment of foods is regarded as a \"natural\" preservation method, as it does not use chemical preservatives.<ref name=\"Adams 94\" />\n\n==Criticism==\nAnurag Sharma, a geochemist; James Scott, a microbiologist; and others at the Carnegie Institution of Washington directly observed microbial activity at pressures in excess of 1 gigapascal.<ref name=\"sharma\">{{cite journal|author = Sharma, A.|title = Microbial activity at Gigapascal pressures|journal = Science|pages = 1514\u20131516|year = 2002|doi=10.1126/science.1068018|volume = 295|issue = 5559|pmid = 11859192|bibcode = 2002Sci...295.1514S |display-authors=etal|url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3216838cf955b06664b9f1e95bb5717b6955abef}}</ref> The experiments were performed up to 1.6 GPa (232,000 psi) of pressure, which is more than 16,000 times [[Atmosphere (unit)|normal air pressure]], or about 14 times the pressure in [[Mariana trench|the deepest ocean trench]].\n\nThe experiment began by depositing an ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' and ''[[Shewanella oneidensis]]'' film in a [[Diamond Anvil Cell]] (DAC). The pressure was then raised to 1.6 GPa. When raised to this pressure and kept there for 30 hours, at least 1% of the bacteria survived. The experimenters then monitored formate metabolism using in-situ [[Raman spectroscopy]] and showed that formate metabolism continued in the bacterial sample.\n\nMoreover, 1.6 GPa is such great pressure that during the experiment the DAC turned the solution into [[Ice IV|ice-IV]], a room-temperature ice. When the bacteria broke down the formate in the ice, liquid pockets would form because of the chemical reaction.<ref name=\"couz\">{{cite journal|author = Couzin, J. |title = Weight of the world on microbes' shoulders|journal = Science|pages = 1444\u20131445|year = 2002|doi=10.1126/science.295.5559.1444b|volume = 295|issue = 5559|pmid = 11859165 }}</ref>\n\nThere was some skepticism of this experiment. According to Art Yayanos, an oceanographer at the [[Scripps Institute of Oceanography]], an organism should only be considered living if it can reproduce. Another issue with the DAC experiment is that when high pressures occur, there are usually high temperatures present as well, but in this experiment there were not. This experiment was performed at room-temperature. However, the intentional lack of high temperature in the experiments isolated the actual effects of pressure on life and results clearly indicated life to be largely pressure insensitive.<ref name=\"couz\"/>\n\nNewer results from independent research groups <ref name=\"vanlint\">{{cite journal|author = Vanlinit, D.|title = Rapid Acquisition of Gigapascal-High-Pressure Resistance by Escherichia coli|journal = mBio|pages = e00130-10|year = 2011|doi= 10.1128/mBio.00130-10|volume = 2|issue = 1|display-authors=etal|pmid=21264062|pmc=3025523}}</ref> have confirmed Sharma et al.
