It was developed by Dutch video game development company [[Two Tribes B.V.]] and is their first published video game. The game follows a young chick, Toki Tori, and his quest to rescue his younger siblings, still in their eggs. To progress through the game, the player must pick up each egg on a level using a set number of tools, with new tools being introduced as the player progresses through the four worlds. This usually involves careful planning and creative thinking.\n\n''Toki Tori'' was later released for [[Windows Mobile]] and an enhanced [[Video game remake|remake]] was released for [[Nintendo]]'s [[Wii]] via [[WiiWare]]. In the Summer of 2009, Chillingo published another enhanced remake of the game for the [[iOS]]. In 2010, Two Tribes released a [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] remake on [[Steam (software)|Steam]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/38700/Toki_Tori/|title=Toki Tori on Steam|date=2010-01-27|publisher=Steam|accessdate=2018-01-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tokitori.com/en/pc/introduction/|title=Introduction - PC - Toki Tori|date=2010-01-27|publisher=Two Tribes B.V.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100119065543/http://www.tokitori.com/en/pc/introduction/|archivedate=19 January 2010|accessdate=2010-01-27|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> A DRM-free version of the game was released on January 2012 as part of the [[Humble Indie Bundle|Humble Bundle for Android]]. This marked a simultaneous release of the game on [[OS X]], [[Linux]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]]. The original version of the game was re-released on the [[Nintendo 3DS]] [[Nintendo eShop|eShop]] as a [[Virtual Console]] title on 31 August 2012, and an HD port of the game was released for the [[Wii U]] eShop on 7 November 2013.<ref name=\"WiiUrelease\"/> An updated version of ''Toki Tori'' was released on the [[Nintendo 3DS]] eShop on 5 November 2015. A release for the [[Nintendo Switch]] followed on 30 March 2018.\n\n==Story==\nThe [[plot (narrative)|story]] begins in a [[chicken coop]] with many unhatched [[egg (biology)|eggs]]. All of a sudden the eggs are swept away except one that coincidentally falls out of the coop and hatches. Out of the egg comes the chicken, Toki Tori. He watches as his brothers and sisters fly towards a scary looking [[castle]]. He decides to set out on an [[adventure]] and rescue his unborn family.\n\nIn the beginning cinematic, Toki Tori is on a cliff overlooking a castle and surrounded by a forest. He begins his quest in this forest, which ends with him entering the castle. In this castle, Toki Tori learns that he has special abilities that help him locate the eggs such as [[Teleportation|telewarp]] and bridge builder from a book he finds. He also learns in the [[castle]] that his powers were most likely the reason of the eggs' [[kidnapping]]. Upon finishing the castle world, Toki Tori falls through a trap door where he lands in the sewers, infested with slugs. When he is done collecting his brethren from this world, a strong torrent of water sweeps him up and sends him to Bubble Barrage, the last area of the game. After traversing this underwater world, Toki Tori returns home with his brothers and sisters.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Toki Tori for Smartphone.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The first world, Forest Falls, of Toki Tori]]\nGameplay in Toki Tori consists of using a limited number of [[tool]]s to gather up all the eggs in the [[level (computer and video games)|level]] in a single run through it in a certain amount of time. Toki Tori is given a set number of tools in the beginning of a level. The puzzles are designed around the tools so they must be used intelligently and usually using a tool incorrectly makes the level unbeatable. Enemies usually appear following a simple patrol of walking back and forth, turning when they hit an obstacle.  If they touch Toki Tori, he instantly dies, forcing the player to restart the level. Some tools are [[weapon]]s that can defeat these monsters; however, they must be used wisely to allow completion of the level. Besides the threat of monsters, a timer is constantly ticking down. If the timer reaches zero, the player must restart the level. Once the player has a clear idea of how to beat the level, however, there is usually ample time to execute the plan. There are fifteen levels in each of the four worlds, not including tutorial levels that appear when a previously unseen tool appears. Only the first ten are required to enter the next area. The other five are much more difficult and are there to add [[replay value]].\n\n===Worlds===\nThere are four worlds in Toki Tori: Forest Falls, Creepy Castle, Slime Sewers (Slime Caves in the Game Boy Color version) and Bubble Barrage. The worlds become progressively more challenging as the player progresses through them, with later levels usually only having one specific way of collecting all the eggs. The most obvious difference in the worlds and their unique enemies is simply cosmetics.  Enemies all behave in the same fashion and the goal of each world is the same: collect all the eggs in one attempt.\n\nThe biggest difference in the worlds, besides cosmetics, is how each world has a specific tool associated with it. Forest Falls is the only level above water with the Freeze-o-matic, which used incorrectly can create obstacles as it freezes enemies in place. Creepy Castle contains the Ghost Trap, usable for passing through stone walls as well as beating ghosts. Slime Sewers contains the Snail Sucker, which is the only weapon that directly removes an enemy from the map. Bubble Barrage contains the Freeze-o-matic as well. When underwater, however, the frozen enemies float up so the game considers it a separate tool. Also Bubble Barrage uniquely contains the Bubble Suit.\n\nAt the end of the ten normal worlds, the player is treated to a short cinematic of Toki Tori entering the next world either on purpose or by accident. This is used to connect the levels more directly for the sake of the story.\n\n===Tools===\nTools are Toki Tori's main method of accomplishing his goal. The game claims ten different tools, as they count Freeze-o-matic a second time when used underwater.  At the start of each level, the player is given a certain number of up to four separate tools (not including the Eyes tool). Although not officially separated, tools come in two varieties: navigation and weapons.\n\nNavigational tools help Toki Tori move around obstacles and get to higher and lower floors that would be otherwise inaccessible. For example, Toki Tori can jump half his height up and half his height forward. To cross a pit, then, he would need to fill the pit with blocks using his Crate Creator or place a platform over it with the bridge builder. Some items allow him to through walls, such as the [[Teleportation|telewarp]]. The most versatile tool is the Bubble Barrage-only Bubble Suit. It allows Toki Tori to travel one half his width/height in any of the four directions, to cross pits, climb up floors or avoid enemies. If the player has at least one use of it left, they may float indefinitely. It also can be refilled to five, ten or fifteen uses at recharge points scattered throughout most Bubble Barrage levels.\n\nWeapon tools allow Toki Tori to hinder enemies or even remove them from the level. These are especially useful as Toki Tori has no [[Health (gaming)|life bar]] so a single hit will end the current attempt. The Freeze-o-matic freezes an opponent in a block of ice which will either fall to the ground or float up to the ceiling depending on whether the level is underwater or not. In both cases, careful planning can ensure that the block of ice is a platform while poor planning can make it a road block. The Ghost Trap, when placed on stone floors, causes the floor to give way when a ghost walks on it. This doesn't destroy the ghost but can get it out of the player's way. It also allows the Ghost Trap to work as a navigational tool to get to lower floors. The Snail Sucker sucks can either suck in slugs, removing them from the level, or cause them to change directions if they aren't sucked all the way into the Snail Sucker.  The latter use does not cost one use of the Snail Sucker.\n\nOne tool that is different from the rest is the Eyes tool. This tool is available on every level and has unlimited uses.  It pauses Toki Tori and any enemies in the level, but not the timer, and allows the player to freely look at the level, controlling the camera with the directional pad, which assists in planning their path.\n\nThe Eyes tool and timer were only present in the GBC version of ''Toki Tori''.\n\n==Remakes and re-releases==\n[[AIM Productions]] published a port of the game for [[Windows Mobile]] with improved graphics and slight changes to certain [[level (computer and video games)|levels]] in 2003. In 2009, Chillingo published the game for [[iOS]] (iPhone).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://toucharcade.com/2009/04/07/chillingo-to-bring-two-tribes-toki-tori-on-iphone/|title=Chillingo to Bring Two Tribe's 'Toki Tori' on iPhone|date=2009-04-07|publisher=Touch Arcade|accessdate=2009-04-07}}</ref>\n\n===Wii version===\nAn [[Video game remake|enhanced remake]] of ''Toki Tori'' was released for the [[Wii]] via [[WiiWare]] in 2008.<ref name=remakeannouncement>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/10/02/toki-tori-take-2|title=Toki Tori, Take 2!|website=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]]|date=2007-10-02|accessdate=2018-01-03}}</ref> It was a WiiWare [[Launch game|launch title]] in Europe, being released on 20 May 2008,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2008/05/wiiware_launches_in_europe|title=WiiWare Launches In Europe|author=Damien McFerran|website=[[Nintendo Life]]|date=2008-05-19|accessdate=2018-01-03}}</ref> and was later released in North America on 2 June 2008.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2008/06/usa_wiiware_update_protothea_and_toki_tori|author=Darren Calvert|title=USA WiiWare Update: Prot\u00f6thea And Toki Tori|website=Nintendo Life|date=2008-06-02|accessdate=2018-01-03}}</ref>\n\nThe Wii remake of ''Toki Tori'' features a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] design while retaining his two dimensional scrolling gameplay, and allows players to use a control scheme that uses the [[Wii Remote]]'s pointer function to lead Toki Tori through each level.

The goal of an older brother rescuing his egg-bound siblings is maintained.  The fundamental gameplay style was also carried over from predecessor to successor. Eggbert is given a limited amount of up to three tools which must used conservatively and intelligently to gather eggs while avoiding enemies which lurk about the stages.  The character appearance of Toki Tori is the same as Eggbert, though with graphical improvements to the [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]]. ''Eggbert'' provided three of the four worlds for ''Toki Tori''. Many tools from ''Eggbert'' reappear in ''Toki Tori'', though some are cosmetically different: for example, Toki Tori's Freeze-o-matic works identically as Eggbert's slime gun; Eggbert's clone creator, which makes a gray, life-sized doll of Eggbert that acts both as a blockade and a platform, is functionally identical to Toki Tori's Crate Creator.\n\n[[File:Eggbert Chip Level.gif|right|thumb|200px|The Chip Level of ''Eggbert'', which was replaced by Creepy Castle in ''Toki Tori'']]\nThe changes between the two are minor, showing no drastically redesigned composition.

There is no exposition of Eggbert's abilities as there is of Toki Tori at the end of the \"Creepy Castle\" level, which replaced the predecessor's \"Chip Level\". In technical gameplay, ''Eggbert'' had shorter and simpler levels than its successor, which also added a complement of 20 \"extra-hard\" levels. The tutorial levels of ''Eggbert'' were all placed in the same optional world, as opposed to ''Toki Tori''{{'}}s mandatory tutorial levels scattered throughout the game.  A few of Eggbert's tools were omitted, including one that turned him invisible or one magnet that caused an enemy to reverse direction, though the ability of this latter tool was added to the \"Snail Sucker\" in ''Toki Tori''.

A ''[[GamePro]]'' writer commented how its challenging puzzles made it an enjoyable game.<ref name=\"GPreview\"/> One ''[[Game Informer]]'' reviewer called it \"thoughtful title in Game Boy Color's sea of pooped-out platformers\".<ref name=\"GIreview\"/> Besides the puzzles, critics also praised the graphics saying the game \"even fits right at home on the Game Boy Advance, looking as close to a native GBA game as any Game Boy Color title has ever come\".<ref name=\"IGNreview\"/>\n\nReviews for the WiiWare release of the game were also positive, with ''[[IGN]]'' giving the game an 8/10, saying that the gameplay holds up extremely well, with the presentation significantly better than the original Game Boy Color release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/878/878347p1.html|author=Craig Harris|title=IGN Wii: Toki Tori Review|date=2008-06-02|website=IGN|publisher=News Corporation|accessdate=2008-06-03|archivedate=3 June 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603121421/http://wii.ign.com/articles/878/878347p1.html|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> ''N-Europe'' highly praised the title, giving it a 9/10 and commenting that it was 'oozing with charm and held together with love'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://n-europe.com/review.php?rid=384|title=WiiWare Review: Toki Tori|publisher=N-Europe|first=Nathan|last=Whincup|date=2008-06-08|accessdate=2008-06-10}}</ref> The WiiWare version was nominated for multiple Wii-specific awards by ''IGN'' in its 2008 video game awards, including Best WiiWare Game<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bestof.ign.com/2008/wii/20.html|title=IGN Wii: Best WiiWare Game 2008|website=IGN|publisher=News Corporation|accessdate=2008-12-19|date=2008-12-18|archivedate=22 December 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222040904/http://bestof.ign.com/2008/wii/20.html|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and Best Puzzle Game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/editors-choice/games?sortBy=score&sortOrder=asc&genre=puzzle&startIndex=75|title=IGN Wii: Best Puzzle Game 2008|date=2008-12-18|website=IGN|publisher=News Corporation|accessdate=2018-01-03}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website}}\n\n[[Category:2001 video games]]\n[[Category:Android (operating system) games]]\n[[Category:Capcom games]]\n[[Category:Game Boy Color games]]\n[[Category:iOS games]]\n[[Category:Linux games]]\n[[Category:Nintendo 3DS eShop games]]\n[[Category:Nintendo Switch eShop games]]\n[[Category:MacOS games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation 3 games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation Network games]]\n[[Category:Puzzle video games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the Netherlands]]\n[[Category:Video game remakes]]\n[[Category:Video games with 2.5D graphics]]\n[[Category:Virtual Console games]]\n[[Category:Wii U eShop games]]\n[[Category:WiiWare games]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n[[Category:Windows Phone games]]\n[[Category:Single-player video games]]\n[[Category:Fictional chickens]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2013}}\n{{Infobox video game\n|title = Toki Tori\n|image = Toki Tori Coverart.png\n|developer = [[Two Tribes B.V.]], Haakon Keiseraas, Ole Martin Keiseraas\n|publisher = Two Tribes B.V., [[Capcom]], [[AIM Productions]], [[Chillingo]], {{vgrelease|JP|Rainy Frog}}\n|producer = Haakon Keiseraas\n|designer = Haakon Keiseraas\n|composer = Chris J.

It was developed by Dutch video game development company [[Two Tribes B.V.]] and is their first published video game. The game follows a young chick, Toki Tori, and his quest to rescue his younger siblings, still in their eggs. To progress through the game, the player must pick up each egg on a level using a set number of tools, with new tools being introduced as the player progresses through the four worlds. This usually involves careful planning and creative thinking.\n\n''Toki Tori'' was later released for [[Windows Mobile]] and an [[Video game remake|enhanced remake]] was released for [[Nintendo]]'s [[Wii]] via [[WiiWare]]. In the Summer of 2009, Chillingo published another enhanced remake of the game for the [[iOS]]. In 2010, Two Tribes released a [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] remake on [[Steam (software)|Steam]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/38700/Toki_Tori/|title=Toki Tori on Steam|date=2010-01-27|publisher=Steam|accessdate=2018-01-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tokitori.com/en/pc/introduction/|title=Introduction - PC - Toki Tori|date=2010-01-27|publisher=Two Tribes B.V.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100119065543/http://www.tokitori.com/en/pc/introduction/|archivedate=19 January 2010|accessdate=2010-01-27|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> A DRM-free version of the game was released on January 2012 as part of the [[Humble Indie Bundle|Humble Bundle for Android]]. This marked a simultaneous release of the game on [[OS X]], [[Linux]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]]. The original version of the game was re-released on the [[Nintendo 3DS]] [[Nintendo eShop|eShop]] as a [[Virtual Console]] title on 31 August 2012, and an HD port of the game was released for the [[Wii U]] eShop on 7 November 2013.<ref name=\"WiiUrelease\"/> An updated version of ''Toki Tori'' was released on the [[Nintendo 3DS]] eShop on 5 November 2015. A release for the [[Nintendo Switch]] followed on 30 March 2018.\n\n==Story==\nThe [[plot (narrative)|story]] begins in a [[chicken coop]] with many unhatched [[egg (biology)|eggs]]. All of a sudden the eggs are swept away except one that coincidentally falls out of the coop and hatches. Out of the egg comes the chicken, Toki Tori. He watches as his brothers and sisters fly towards a scary looking [[castle]]. He decides to set out on an [[adventure]] and rescue his unborn family.\n\nIn the beginning cinematic, Toki Tori is on a cliff overlooking a castle and surrounded by a forest. He begins his quest in this forest, which ends with him entering the castle. In this castle, Toki Tori learns that he has special abilities that help him locate the eggs such as [[Teleportation|telewarp]] and bridge builder from a book he finds. He also learns in the [[castle]] that his powers were most likely the reason of the eggs' [[kidnapping]]. Upon finishing the castle world, Toki Tori falls through a trap door where he lands in the sewers, infested with slugs. When he is done collecting his brethren from this world, a strong torrent of water sweeps him up and sends him to Bubble Barrage, the last area of the game. After traversing this underwater world, Toki Tori returns home with his brothers and sisters.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Toki Tori for Smartphone.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The first world, Forest Falls, of Toki Tori]]\nGameplay in Toki Tori consists of using a limited number of [[tool]]s to gather up all the eggs in the [[level (computer and video games)|level]] in a single run through it in a certain amount of time. Toki Tori is given a set number of tools in the beginning of a level. The puzzles are designed around the tools so they must be used intelligently and usually using a tool incorrectly makes the level unbeatable. Enemies usually appear following a simple patrol of walking back and forth, turning when they hit an obstacle.  If they touch Toki Tori, he instantly dies, forcing the player to restart the level. Some tools are [[weapon]]s that can defeat these monsters; however, they must be used wisely to allow completion of the level. Besides the threat of monsters, a timer is constantly ticking down. If the timer reaches zero, the player must restart the level. Once the player has a clear idea of how to beat the level, however, there is usually ample time to execute the plan. There are fifteen levels in each of the four worlds, not including tutorial levels that appear when a previously unseen tool appears. Only the first ten are required to enter the next area. The other five are much more difficult and are there to add [[replay value]].\n\n===Worlds===\nThere are four worlds in Toki Tori: Forest Falls, Creepy Castle, Slime Sewers (Slime Caves in the Game Boy Color version) and Bubble Barrage. The worlds become progressively more challenging as the player progresses through them, with later levels usually only having one specific way of collecting all the eggs. The most obvious difference in the worlds and their unique enemies is simply cosmetics.  Enemies all behave in the same fashion and the goal of each world is the same: collect all the eggs in one attempt.\n\nThe biggest difference in the worlds, besides cosmetics, is how each world has a specific tool associated with it. Forest Falls is the only level above water with the Freeze-o-matic, which used incorrectly can create obstacles as it freezes enemies in place. Creepy Castle contains the Ghost Trap, usable for passing through stone walls as well as beating ghosts. Slime Sewers contains the Snail Sucker, which is the only weapon that directly removes an enemy from the map. Bubble Barrage contains the Freeze-o-matic as well. When underwater, however, the frozen enemies float up so the game considers it a separate tool. Also Bubble Barrage uniquely contains the Bubble Suit.\n\nAt the end of the ten normal worlds, the player is treated to a short cinematic of Toki Tori entering the next world either on purpose or by accident. This is used to connect the levels more directly for the sake of the story.\n\n===Tools===\nTools are Toki Tori's main method of accomplishing his goal. The game claims ten different tools, as they count Freeze-o-matic a second time when used underwater.  At the start of each level, the player is given a certain number of up to four separate tools (not including the Eyes tool). Although not officially separated, tools come in two varieties: navigation and weapons.\n\nNavigational tools help Toki Tori move around obstacles and get to higher and lower floors that would be otherwise inaccessible. For example, Toki Tori can jump half his height up and half his height forward. To cross a pit, then, he would need to fill the pit with blocks using his Crate Creator or place a platform over it with the bridge builder. Some items allow him to through walls, such as the [[Teleportation|telewarp]]. The most versatile tool is the Bubble Barrage-only Bubble Suit. It allows Toki Tori to travel one half his width/height in any of the four directions, to cross pits, climb up floors or avoid enemies. If the player has at least one use of it left, they may float indefinitely. It also can be refilled to five, ten or fifteen uses at recharge points scattered throughout most Bubble Barrage levels.\n\nWeapon tools allow Toki Tori to hinder enemies or even remove them from the level. These are especially useful as Toki Tori has no [[Health (gaming)|life bar]] so a single hit will end the current attempt. The Freeze-o-matic freezes an opponent in a block of ice which will either fall to the ground or float up to the ceiling depending on whether the level is underwater or not. In both cases, careful planning can ensure that the block of ice is a platform while poor planning can make it a road block. The Ghost Trap, when placed on stone floors, causes the floor to give way when a ghost walks on it. This doesn't destroy the ghost but can get it out of the player's way. It also allows the Ghost Trap to work as a navigational tool to get to lower floors. The Snail Sucker sucks can either suck in slugs, removing them from the level, or cause them to change directions if they aren't sucked all the way into the Snail Sucker.  The latter use does not cost one use of the Snail Sucker.\n\nOne tool that is different from the rest is the Eyes tool. This tool is available on every level and has unlimited uses.  It pauses Toki Tori and any enemies in the level, but not the timer, and allows the player to freely look at the level, controlling the camera with the directional pad, which assists in planning their path.\n\nThe Eyes tool and timer were only present in the GBC version of ''Toki Tori''.\n\n==Remakes and re-releases==\n[[AIM Productions]] published a port of the game for [[Windows Mobile]] with improved graphics and slight changes to certain [[level (computer and video games)|levels]] in 2003. In 2009, Chillingo published the game for [[iOS]] (iPhone).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://toucharcade.com/2009/04/07/chillingo-to-bring-two-tribes-toki-tori-on-iphone/|title=Chillingo to Bring Two Tribe's 'Toki Tori' on iPhone|date=2009-04-07|publisher=Touch Arcade|accessdate=2009-04-07}}</ref>\n\n===Wii version===\nAn [[Video game remake|enhanced remake]] of ''Toki Tori'' was released for the [[Wii]] via [[WiiWare]] in 2008.<ref name=remakeannouncement>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/10/02/toki-tori-take-2|title=Toki Tori, Take 2!|website=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]]|date=2007-10-02|accessdate=2018-01-03}}</ref> It was a WiiWare [[Launch game|launch title]] in Europe, being released on 20 May 2008,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2008/05/wiiware_launches_in_europe|title=WiiWare Launches In Europe|author=Damien McFerran|website=[[Nintendo Life]]|date=2008-05-19|accessdate=2018-01-03}}</ref> and was later released in North America on 2 June 2008.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2008/06/usa_wiiware_update_protothea_and_toki_tori|author=Darren Calvert|title=USA WiiWare Update: Prot\u00f6thea And Toki Tori|website=Nintendo Life|date=2008-06-02|accessdate=2018-01-03}}</ref>\n\nThe Wii remake of ''Toki Tori'' features a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] design while retaining his two dimensional scrolling gameplay, and allows players to use a control scheme that uses the [[Wii Remote]]'s pointer function to lead Toki Tori through each level.

The goal of an older brother rescuing his egg-bound siblings is maintained.  The fundamental gameplay style was also carried over from predecessor to successor.

The character appearance of Toki Tori is the same as Eggbert, though with graphical improvements to the [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]]. ''Eggbert'' provided three of the four worlds for ''Toki Tori''. Many tools from ''Eggbert'' reappear in ''Toki Tori'', though some are cosmetically different: for example, Toki Tori's Freeze-o-matic works identically as Eggbert's slime gun; Eggbert's clone creator, which makes a gray, life-sized doll of Eggbert that acts both as a blockade and a platform, is functionally identical to Toki Tori's Crate Creator.\n\n[[File:Eggbert Chip Level.gif|right|thumb|200px|The Chip Level of ''Eggbert'', which was replaced by Creepy Castle in ''Toki Tori'']]\nThe changes between the two are minor, showing no drastically redesigned composition.

There is no exposition of Eggbert's abilities as there is of Toki Tori at the end of the \"Creepy Castle\" level, which replaced the predecessor's \"Chip Level\". In technical gameplay, ''Eggbert'' had shorter and simpler levels than its successor, which also added a complement of 20 \"extra-hard\" levels. The tutorial levels of ''Eggbert'' were all placed in the same optional world, as opposed to ''Toki Tori''{{'}}s mandatory tutorial levels scattered throughout the game.  A few of Eggbert's tools were omitted, including one that turned him invisible or one magnet that caused an enemy to reverse direction, though the ability of this latter tool was added to the \"Snail Sucker\" in ''Toki Tori''. An example of a tool unique to the successor is an Eye which allows Toki Tori to peer around the entire level, an ability unnecessary in ''Eggbert''.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| GR = GBC: 80%<ref name=\"GRpage\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gamerankings.com/gbc/468485-toki-tori/index.html |title=Toki Tori for Game Boy Color |website=[[GameRankings]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=2018-10-30}}</ref><br />iOS: 94%<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamerankings.com/iphone/962254-toki-tori/index.html |title=Toki Tori for iOS (iPhone/iPad) |website=[[GameRankings]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=2018-10-30}}</ref>\n| MC = WII: 79/100<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/wii/toki-tori |title=Toki Tori for Wii Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=2018-10-30}}</ref><br />PC: 80/100<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/toki-tori |title=Toki Tori for PC Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=2018-10-30}}</ref><br />PS3: 75/100<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-3/toki-tori |title=Toki Tori for PlayStation 3 Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=2018-10-30}}</ref><br />3DS: 76/100<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/3ds/toki-tori-3d |title=Toki Tori 3D for 3DS Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=2018-10-30}}</ref><br />NS: 82/100<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/switch/toki-tori |title=Toki Tori for Switch Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=2018-10-30}}</ref>\n| GI = 7.5/10<ref name=\"GIreview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/Games/Review/200104/R03.0804.1135.40781.htm|title=Toki Tori|work=[[Game Informer]]|accessdate=2008-01-04|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090710195442/http://www.gameinformer.com/Games/Review/200104/R03.0804.1135.40781.htm|archivedate=10 July 2009|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n| GamePro = 4/5<ref name=\"GPreview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamepro.com/nintendo/gameboy_color/games/reviews/15380.shtml|title=Review: Toki Tori for Game Boy Color|publisher=[[GamePro]]|date=2001-07-17|accessdate=2008-01-04|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041205155222/http://www.gamepro.com/nintendo/gameboy_color/games/reviews/15380.shtml|archivedate=5 December 2004|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n| GSpot = 8.2/10<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gbc/puzzle/tokitori/index.html?tag=result;title;0|title=Toki Tori for GBC|website=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=2008-01-04}}</ref>\n| IGN = 9/10<ref name=\"IGNreview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2001/10/23/toki-tori|title=IGN: Toki Tori Review |website=IGN|publisher=News Corporation|date=2001-10-23|accessdate=2018-01-03}}</ref>\n| NLife = 8/10<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/wiiu-eshop/toki_tori|author=Marcel van Duyn|title=Review: Toki Tori (Wii U)|website=Nintendo Life|date=2013-11-15|accessdate=2018-01-03}}</ref><br>9/10<ref name=nintendolife/>\n| rev1 = ''Cubed3''\n| rev1Score = 8/10<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cubed3.com/review/2454/1/toki-tori-3d-nintendo-3ds.html|title=Toki Tori 3D (Nintendo 3DS) Review|website=Cubed3|date=2015-11-30|accessdate=2018-01-03}}</ref>\n| award1Pub  = IGN\n| award1     = Editors' Choice Award<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gameboy.ign.com/index/choice.html|title=IGN.com Editors' Choice Awards|website=IGN|publisher=News Corporation|accessdate=2008-01-04|archivedate=26 January 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080126125211/http://gameboy.ign.com/index/choice.html|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n}}\n\n''Toki Tori'' was one of the last games released for the [[Game Boy Color]].

She exhibited quite frequently, her photography was personal in feeling with an appreciation of certain qualities of light in the surroundings.  After university she pursued photography by joining Dupain at his new studio, 24 Bond Street, Sydney. Her contemporaries included [[Damien Parer]], Geoff Powell, the model Jean Lorraine and photographer Olga Sharpe, who frequented the studio.\n\nIn Australia during the 1930s clients assumed a man would be the photographer.

The photograph \"She-oaks\" (1928) was taken at Bungan Beach headland in this period.\n\nCotton attended the [[MLC School|Methodist Ladies' College]], [[Burwood, New South Wales|Burwood]] in Sydney from 1921 to 1929,<ref name=Breuer>[http://www.evabreuerartdealer.com.au/cv/cotton_olive_bio.html Cotton biography and resum\u00e9]</ref> gained a scholarship and went on to complete a B.A. at the [[University of Sydney]] in 1933, majoring in English and Mathematics; she also studied music and was an accomplished pianist with a particular fondness for [[Nocturnes (Chopin)|Chopin's Nocturnes]].\n\n==Photography==\nCotton joined [[The Sydney Camera Circle]] and the Photographic Society of New South Wales, gaining instruction and encouragement from important photographers such as [[Harold Cazneaux]].\n\nShe exhibited her first photograph, \"Dusk\", at the New South Wales Photographic Society\u2019s Interstate Exhibition of 1932. She exhibited quite frequently, her photography was personal in feeling with an appreciation of certain qualities of light in the surroundings.  After university she pursued photography by joining Dupain at his new studio, 24 Bond Street, Sydney. Her contemporaries included [[Damien Parer]], Geoff Powell, the model Jean Lorraine and photographer Olga Sharpe, who frequented the studio.\n\nIn Australia during the 1930s clients assumed a man would be the photographer. Cotton wryly referred to herself as \"the assistant\".<ref name=Ennis/> However whenever possible Cotton photographed visiting celebrities or interesting objects in the studio, even capturing Dupain working in her piece, \"Fashion shot, Cronulla Sandhills, circa 1937\" and made portraits of him.<ref name=Ennis/> The publisher [[Sydney Ure Smith]] gave her many commissions, and regarded her as one of the best photographers of the 1930s and 1940s.\n\nDuring the 1930s Cotton developed mastery using the 'Pictorial' style of photography popular at the time and also incorporated a very modern style approach.<ref name=\"agnsw\" />\n\nThe [[Commonwealth Bank]]'s staff magazine ''Bank Notes'' featured Cotton's more non-commercial photographs as illustrations.\n\n===Signature photographs===\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | header    =\n | header_align = left/right/center\n | header_background =\n | footer    =\n | footer_align = left/right/center\n | footer_background =\n | width     =\n | image1    = Olive Cotton - Tea cup ballet, 1935.jpg\n | width1    = 140 | caption1  = ''[[Tea cup ballet]]'', 1935\n | alt1      = \n | image2    = Olive Cotton - Only to taste the warmth, the light, the wind, 1939.jpg\n | width2    = 160\n | caption2  = ''Only to taste the warmth, the light, the wind'', 1939\n | alt2      =\n}}\n''[[Tea cup ballet]]'' (1935) was photographed in the studio after Cotton had bought some inexpensive china from Woolworth's to replace the old chipped studio crockery.

They lived in a tent for the first three years, then moving to a small farm where their two children grew up. She taught Mathematics at Cowra High School for five years until 1964 when she opened a small photographic studio in the town, taking many portraits, wedding photographs, etc., for people in the surrounding district, where her work became well-known and much appreciated, although she was as yet unknown on the postwar city art scene until 1985.\n\n==Exhibitions==\nAmong others, her work was shown in the following exhibitions:\n*1938 ''Commemorative Salon of Photography'' exhibition held by the Photographic Society of NSW as part of the Australian 150th anniversary celebrations.\n*1938 Group show with the Contemporary Camera Groupe at [[David Jones Limited|David Jones Gallery]], Sydney.\n*1981 ''Australian Women Photographers 1890-1950'' touring exhibition, curated by Jenni Mather, Christine Gillespie and Barbara Hall.\n*1985 ''Olive Cotton Photographs 1924-1984'' retrospective held at the [[Australian Centre for Photography]], Sydney, touring numerous regional galleries in NSW, Victoria and Queensland throughout 1986.\n\n==Death==\nCotton died on 27 September 2003, aged 92.<ref name=agnsw>[http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/collection/works/127.2013/ Art Gallery NSW].

In 1943 she was the first woman to be appointed as a trustee of the [[Art Gallery of New South Wales]]. She was a noted advocate of contemporary art in Australia, and a student of [[Andr\u00e9 Lhote]] in Paris in 1938. Evatt did much to promote modernism in Australian public life in the 1930s to 1950s. With direct links to the centre of political power in mid 20th century Australia via her husband's legal and political career, she enjoyed unique public agency for an Australian woman artist in the mid 20th century and much of her career unfolded in the public spotlight.\n\n== Early life and early political activities ==\n\nEvatt was born in Iowa to Samuel Sheffer (d.1929), manufacturing chemist, and his wife Alice Maud, n\u00e9e Holt. As a child, her family moved to New Zealand, then Melbourne, and finally settled in Sydney where her family enjoyed a comfortable life due to her father's business success.\n\nShe enrolled in the architecture school at the [[University of Sydney]] but after meeting [[H.V. Evatt]] changed her course to legal studies to better engage with his interests. They married in 1919, against her father's wishes, as he regarded Evatt as from a lower social class, and travelled overseas for their honeymoon. Evatt also wrote poetry at this date and throughout her life, which remained unpublished. Throughout the 1920s she supported her husband by vigorously campaigning amongst women voters and also organising relief for families affected by the great depression.\n\n== Art career in the 1930s ==\n\nHer husband's appointment as a judge of the Supreme Court of Australia in 1930 meant that the couple travelled frequently, allowing Evatt to spend time in classes at both of Australia's most radical art schools at that date, the Bell-Shore School in Melbourne and Crowley-Fizelle school in Sydney. A mature and diligent student, her art developed and consolidated rapidly and whilst her output was relatively small, her paintings easily match those of more prolific contemporaries. Her awareness of a broad range of modern art was unusual in an Australian context.<ref>Melissa Boyde  Mary Alice Evatt MAS 1898\u20131973 exhibition catalogue p 7</ref> In Melbourne she became close to the early Australian cubist [[Moya Dyring]], and they remained friends throughout their lives.<ref>{{cite book|first=Gaynor|last= Cuthbert|title= Paintings from Paris: the life and art of Moya Dyring Kerrimuir|publisher= Victoria : Rose Library Publications|date= 2014}}</ref> Evatt often visited Moya in Paris and the two women painted together in France. Art patrons John and [[Sunday Reed]] also were friends and through them Evatt and her high profiled husband became known in the [[Heide Circle]]. Through [[George Bell (painter)|George Bell]] and [[John Reed (art patron)|John Reed]] both of the Evatts became active in the Contemporary Art Society. In 1938 Evatt studied with [[Andr\u00e9 Lhote]] in Paris and [[Hans Hofmann]] in New York.\n\n== Art Gallery of New South Wales trustee ==\n\nAppointed a trustee of the [[Art Gallery of New South Wales]] (AGNSW) in 1943, she often voted against the conservative stance of the other trustees, including during the controversy about [[William Dobell]]'s portrait of [[Joshua Smith (artist)|Joshua Smith]]. She was an ally and a supporter of the young [[Bernard Smith (art historian)|Bernard Smith]] who managed the wartime touring exhibitions of Australian art sent out from the AGNSW into rural NSW, an initiative that Evatt advocated. Notably she was one of the strong women who facilitated and supported Smith's career.<ref>{{cite book|author=Juliette Peers|chapter=Preface to 'All Things Opposite|title= Antipodean Perspective Selected Writings of Bernard Smith|editor=Rex Butler and Sheridan Palmer|publisher= Monash University PUblishing|date= 2018}}</ref> She held that post until 1970, and was the only female trustee during those years. Her public career and her political commitment made an early link between the Australian Labor Party and the art world, which would not be ratified until the election of the government of Gough Whitlam in 1972. Evatt's lobbying for Smith also enabled him to reach a highly influential position and established his career. Thus Mary Alice Evatt had a uniquely extended influence for a woman artist.\n\n== Public life and World War II==\n\nEvatt's activities extended beyond Australia onto a global stage when her husband was deputy leader in the Curtin Labor Government, spending time in the United States, and more so when H.V.

She met [[Pablo Picasso]] in Paris and invited him to attend the UN assembly. Other significant figures whom she knew included F.D. and [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], [[Charles de Gaulle]], [[Winston Churchill]]. She bought Australian art on behalf of Queen [[Elizabeth II]]. After World War 2 in Paris she worked with curatorial teams bringing public artworks out of wartime safe keeping.\n\nIn the 1950s, a conservative Australian government meant that the Evatts' political and cultural influence significantly diminished in Australia and globally. However Mary Alice had links to the conservative regime through her long friendship with [[Maie Casey]], whom she saw, like Eleanor Roosevelt, as a like-minded colleague. H.V. Evatt's increasing ill-health also shaped her later years, limiting her time for public and cultural affairs, although she held some posts such as the Convenor of Art and Letters for the National Council of Women and presidencies of United Nations related bodied. Evatt judged a number of art shows. Some of her valuable art collection, including a Modigliani, were sold to fund H.V. Evatt's health care costs. Whilst settled in Canberra, she still found time to study with [[Desiderius Orban]] and later at the Canberra School of Art, where she specialised in sculpture. The latter medium became a focus in her later years.\n\n==Touring exhibition ==\nIn 2002\u20132003 a major curated touring exhibition of her work was organised by the Bathurst Regional Gallery, with support from the Evatt Foundation.

In 1943 she was the first woman to be appointed as a trustee of the [[Art Gallery of New South Wales]]. She was a noted advocate of contemporary art in Australia, and a student of [[Andr\u00e9 Lhote]] in Paris in 1938. Evatt did much to promote modernism in Australian public life in the 1930s to 1950s. With direct links to the centre of political power in mid 20th century Australia via her husband's legal and political career, she enjoyed unique public agency for an Australian woman artist in the mid 20th century and much of her career unfolded in the public spotlight.\n\n== Early life and early political activities ==\n\nEvatt was born in Iowa to Samuel Sheffer (d.1929), manufacturing chemist, and his wife Alice Maud, n\u00e9e Holt. As a child, her family moved to New Zealand, then Melbourne, and finally settled in Sydney where her family enjoyed a comfortable life due to her father's business success.\n\nShe enrolled in the architecture school at the [[University of Sydney]] but after meeting [[H.V. Evatt]] changed her course to legal studies to better engage with his interests. They married in 1919, against her father's wishes, as he regarded Evatt as from a lower social class, and travelled overseas for their honeymoon. Evatt also wrote poetry at this date and throughout her life, which remained unpublished. Throughout the 1920s she supported her husband by vigorously campaigning amongst women voters and also organising relief for families affected by the great depression.\n\n== Art career in the 1930s ==\n\nHer husband's appointment as a judge of the Supreme Court of Australia in 1930 meant that the couple travelled frequently, allowing Evatt to spend time in classes at both of Australia's most radical art schools at that date, the Bell-Shore School in Melbourne and Crowley-Fizelle school in Sydney. A mature and diligent student, her art developed and consolidated rapidly and whilst her output was relatively small, her paintings easily match those of more prolific contemporaries. Her awareness of a broad range of modern art was unusual in an Australian context.<ref>Melissa Boyde  Mary Alice Evatt MAS 1898\u20131973 exhibition catalogue p 7</ref> In Melbourne she became close to the early Australian cubist [[Moya Dyring]], and they remained friends throughout their lives.<ref>{{cite book|first=Gaynor|last= Cuthbert|title= Paintings from Paris: the life and art of Moya Dyring Kerrimuir|publisher= Victoria : Rose Library Publications|date= 2014}}</ref> Evatt often visited Moya in Paris and the two women painted together in France. Art patrons John and [[Sunday Reed]] also were friends and through them Evatt and her high profiled husband became known in the [[Heide Circle]]. Through [[George Bell (painter)|George Bell]] and [[John Reed (art patron)|John Reed]] both of the Evatts became active in the Contemporary Art Society. In 1938 Evatt studied with [[Andr\u00e9 Lhote]] in Paris and [[Hans Hofmann]] in New York.\n\n== Art Gallery of New South Wales trustee ==\n\nAppointed a trustee of the [[Art Gallery of New South Wales]] (AGNSW) in 1943, she often voted against the conservative stance of the other trustees, including during the controversy about [[William Dobell]]'s portrait of [[Joshua Smith (artist)|Joshua Smith]]. She was an ally and a supporter of the young [[Bernard Smith (art historian)|Bernard Smith]] who managed the wartime touring exhibitions of Australian art sent out from the AGNSW into rural NSW, an initiative that Evatt advocated. Notably she was one of the strong women who facilitated and supported Smith's career.<ref>{{cite book|author=Juliette Peers|chapter=Preface to 'All Things Opposite|title= Antipodean Perspective Selected Writings of Bernard Smith|editor=Rex Butler and Sheridan Palmer|publisher= Monash University PUblishing|date= 2018}}</ref> She held that post until 1970, and was the only female trustee during those years. Her public career and her political commitment made an early link between the Australian Labor Party and the art world, which would not be ratified until the election of the government of Gough Whitlam in 1972. Evatt's lobbying for Smith also enabled him to reach a highly influential position and established his career.

{"title_page": "Linoleum", "text_new": "{{other uses}}\n{{Refimprove|article|date=April 2007}}\n[[File:Linoleum 003.jpg|thumb|240px|Linoleum from around the 1950s]]\n\n'''Linoleum''', commonly abbreviated to '''lino''', is a [[floor covering]] made from materials such as solidified [[linseed oil]] (linoxyn), pine [[resin]], ground [[Cork (material)|cork]] dust, [[wood flour]], and mineral fillers such as [[calcium carbonate]], most commonly on a [[burlap]] or [[canvas]] backing. Pigments are often added to the materials to create the desired colour finish.\n\nThe finest linoleum floors, known as \"inlaid\", are extremely durable, and are made by joining and inlaying solid pieces of linoleum. Cheaper patterned linoleum comes in different grades or gauges, and were printed with thinner layers which were more prone to wear and tear. High-quality linoleum is flexible and thus can be used in buildings where a more rigid material (such as [[Tile#Floor tiles|ceramic tile]]) would crack.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Tyntesfield 2015 087.jpg|thumb|Early linoleum at [[Tyntesfield]]]]\nLinoleum was invented by Englishman [[Frederick Walton]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The history and manufacture of floorcloth and linoleum |publisher=Society of Chemical Industry |date =21 Nov 1918 |first=M.W. |last=Jones}}</ref> In 1855, Walton happened to notice the rubbery, flexible skin of solidified linseed oil (linoxyn) that had formed on a can of oil-based paint and thought that it might form a substitute for [[natural rubber|India rubber]]. Raw linseed oil oxidizes very slowly, but Walton accelerated the process by heating it with [[lead acetate]]{{Clarify|Lead(II) acetate or Lead(IV) acetate|date=November 2017}} and [[zinc sulfate]]. This made the oil form a resinous mass into which lengths of cheap cotton cloth were dipped until a thick coating formed. The coating was then scraped off and boiled with [[benzene]] or similar solvents to form a varnish. Walton initially planned to sell his varnish to the makers of water-repellent fabrics such as [[oilcloth]], and patented the process in 1860. However, his method had problems: the cotton cloth soon fell apart, and it took months to produce enough of the linoxyn. Little interest was shown in Walton's varnish. In addition, his first factory burned down, and he suffered from persistent and painful rashes.\n\nWalton soon came up with an easier way to transfer the oil to the cotton sheets, by hanging them vertically and sprinkling the oil from above, and he tried mixing the linoxyn with sawdust and cork dust to make it less tacky. In 1863 he applied for a further [[patent]], which read: \"For these purposes canvas or other suitable strong fabrics are coated over on their upper surfaces with a composition of oxidized oil, cork dust, and gum or resin ... such surfaces being afterward printed, embossed, or otherwise ornamented. The back or under surfaces of such fabrics are coated with a coating of such oxidized oils, or oxidized oils and gum or resin, and by preference without an admixture of cork.\"\n\nAt first Walton called his invention \"Kampticon\", which was deliberately close to [[Kamptulicon]], the name of an existing floor covering, but he soon changed it to Linoleum, which he derived from the Latin words \"linum\" (flax) and \"oleum\" (oil). In 1864 he established the Linoleum Manufacturing Company Ltd., with a factory at [[Staines]], near London. The new product did not prove immediately popular, mainly due to intense competition from the makers of Kamptulicon and oilcloth. The company operated at a loss for its first five years, until Walton began an intensive advertising campaign and opened two shops in London for the exclusive sale of Linoleum. Walton's friend Jerimiah Clarke designed the linoleum patterns, typically with a Grecian urn motif around the borders.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nOther inventors began their own experiments after Walton took out his patent, and in 1871 [[William Parnacott]] took out a patent for a method of producing linoxyn by blowing hot air into a tank of linseed oil for several hours, then cooling the material in trays. Unlike Walton's process, which took weeks, Parnacott's method took only a day or two, although the quality of the linoxyn was not as good. Despite this, many manufacturers opted to use the less expensive Parnacott process.\n\nWalton soon faced competition from other manufacturers, including a company which bought the rights to Parnacott's process, and launched its own floor covering, which it named Corticine, from the Latin \"cortex\" (bark or rind). Corticine was mainly made of cork dust and linoxyn without a cloth backing, and became popular because it was cheaper than linoleum.\n\nBy 1869 Walton's factory in [[Staines]], England was exporting to Europe and the United States. In 1877, the [[Scotland|Scottish]] town of [[Kirkcaldy]], in [[Fife]], became the largest producer of linoleum in the world, with no fewer than six floorcloth manufacturers in the town, most notably Michael Nairn & Co., which had been producing floorcloth since 1847.\n\nWalton opened the American Linoleum Manufacturing Company in 1872 on [[Staten Island]], in partnership with Joseph Wild, the company's town being named Linoleumville (renamed [[Travis, Staten Island|Travis]] in 1930).<ref name=lino23/> It was the first U.S. linoleum manufacturer, but was soon followed by the American Nairn Linoleum Company, established by Sir Michael Nairn in 1887 (later the Congoleum Nairn Company, and The Congoleum Corporation of America), in [[Kearny, New Jersey]]. Congoleum now manufactures sheet [[vinyl (fabric)|vinyl]] and no longer has a linoleum line. {{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\nIn 2016 a Dutch flooring producer changed the old concept of a factory manufactured linoleum in rolls or tiles to a liquid poured version (liquid lino) of the linoleum which is applied seamlessly on site. By adding a hybrid extra vegetable based binder the liquid lino sets overnight. This hybrid bindersystem makes the liquid lino highly chemical resistant and permanently flexible.  \n\n=== Loss of trademark protection ===\nWalton was unhappy with Michael Nairn & Co's use of the name Linoleum and brought a lawsuit against them for trademark infringement. However, the term had not been trademarked, and he lost the suit, the court opining that even if the name ''had'' been registered as a trademark, it was by now so widely used that it had [[genericized trademark|become generic]], only 14 years after its invention. It is considered to be the first product name to become a generic term.<ref name=lino23>Powell and Svendsen, p. 23</ref>\n\n== Use == \nBetween the time of its invention in 1860 and its being largely superseded by other hard floor coverings in the 1950s, linoleum was considered to be an excellent, inexpensive material for high-use areas. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, it was favoured in hallways and passages, and as a surround for carpet squares. However, most people associate linoleum with its common twentieth century use on kitchen floors. Its water resistance enabled easy maintenance of sanitary conditions and its resilience made standing easier and reduced breakage of dropped china.\n\nOther products devised by Walton included Linoleum Muralis in 1877, which became better known as [[Lincrusta]]. Essentially a highly durable linoleum wallcovering, Lincrusta could be manufactured to resemble carved plaster or wood, or even leather. It was very successful, and inspired a much cheaper imitation, [[Anaglypta]], originally devised by one of Walton's showroom managers.\n\nWalton also tried integrating designs into linoleum during the manufacturing stage, coming up with granite, marbled, and jasp\u00e9 (striped) linoleum. For the granite variety, granules of various colours of linoleum cement were mixed together, before being hot-rolled. If the granules were not completely mixed before rolling, the result was marbled or jasp\u00e9 patterns.\n\nWalton's next product was inlaid linoleum, which resembled encaustic tiles, in 1882. Previously, linoleum had been produced in solid colours, with patterns printed on the surface if required. In inlaid linoleum, the colours extend all the way through to the backing cloth. Inlaid linoleum was made using a stencil type method where different-coloured granules were placed in shaped metal trays, after which the sheets were run through heated rollers to fuse them to the backing cloth. In 1898 Walton devised a process for making straight-line inlaid linoleum that allowed for crisp, sharp geometric designs. This involved strips of uncured linoleum being cut and pieced together patchwork-fashion before being hot-rolled. Embossed inlaid linoleum was not introduced until 1926.\n\nThe heavier gauges of linoleum are known as \u201cbattleship linoleum\u201d, and are mainly used in high-traffic situations like offices and public buildings. It was originally manufactured to meet the specifications of the U.S. Navy for warship deck covering on enclosed decks instead of wood, hence the name. Most U.S. Navy warships removed their linoleum deck coverings following the attack on Pearl Harbor, as they were considered too flammable. (Use of linoleum persisted in U.S. Navy submarines.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}) Royal Navy warships used the similar product \u201cCorticine\u201d.\n\nEarly in the twentieth century, a group of [[Dresden]] artists used easy-to-cut linoleum instead of wood for [[printmaking]], creating the [[linocut]] printmaking technique    similar to [[woodcut]]s{{cn|date=March 2019}}.  Prominent artists who created linocut prints included [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] and [[Henri Matisse]].\n\n== Present day ==\n[[Image:Linoleum Querschnitt.jpg|thumb|Unlike most [[polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] flooring, the colour goes all the way through the linoleum]]\nLinoleum has largely been replaced as a floor covering by [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC), which is often colloquially but incorrectly called linoleum or lino.

Pigments are often added to the materials to create the desired colour finish.\n\nThe finest linoleum floors, known as \"inlaid\", are extremely durable, and are made by joining and inlaying solid pieces of linoleum. Cheaper patterned linoleum comes in different grades or gauges, and were printed with thinner layers which were more prone to wear and tear. High-quality linoleum is flexible and thus can be used in buildings where a more rigid material (such as [[Tile#Floor tiles|ceramic tile]]) would crack.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Tyntesfield 2015 087.jpg|thumb|Early linoleum at [[Tyntesfield]]]]\nLinoleum was invented by Englishman [[Frederick Walton]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The history and manufacture of floorcloth and linoleum |publisher=Society of Chemical Industry |date =21 Nov 1918 |first=M.W. |last=Jones}}</ref> In 1855, Walton happened to notice the rubbery, flexible skin of solidified linseed oil (linoxyn) that had formed on a can of oil-based paint and thought that it might form a substitute for [[natural rubber|India rubber]]. Raw linseed oil oxidizes very slowly, but Walton accelerated the process by heating it with [[lead acetate]]{{Clarify|Lead(II) acetate or Lead(IV) acetate|date=November 2017}} and [[zinc sulfate]]. This made the oil form a resinous mass into which lengths of cheap cotton cloth were dipped until a thick coating formed. The coating was then scraped off and boiled with [[benzene]] or similar solvents to form a varnish. Walton initially planned to sell his varnish to the makers of water-repellent fabrics such as [[oilcloth]], and patented the process in 1860. However, his method had problems: the cotton cloth soon fell apart, and it took months to produce enough of the linoxyn. Little interest was shown in Walton's varnish. In addition, his first factory burned down, and he suffered from persistent and painful rashes.\n\nWalton soon came up with an easier way to transfer the oil to the cotton sheets, by hanging them vertically and sprinkling the oil from above, and he tried mixing the linoxyn with sawdust and cork dust to make it less tacky. In 1863 he applied for a further [[patent]], which read: \"For these purposes canvas or other suitable strong fabrics are coated over on their upper surfaces with a composition of oxidized oil, cork dust, and gum or resin ... such surfaces being afterward printed, embossed, or otherwise ornamented. The back or under surfaces of such fabrics are coated with a coating of such oxidized oils, or oxidized oils and gum or resin, and by preference without an admixture of cork.\"\n\nAt first Walton called his invention \"Kampticon\", which was deliberately close to [[Kamptulicon]], the name of an existing floor covering, but he soon changed it to Linoleum, which he derived from the Latin words \"linum\" (flax) and \"oleum\" (oil). In 1864 he established the Linoleum Manufacturing Company Ltd., with a factory at [[Staines]], near London. The new product did not prove immediately popular, mainly due to intense competition from the makers of Kamptulicon and oilcloth. The company operated at a loss for its first five years, until Walton began an intensive advertising campaign and opened two shops in London for the exclusive sale of Linoleum. Walton's friend Jerimiah Clarke designed the linoleum patterns, typically with a Grecian urn motif around the borders.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nOther inventors began their own experiments after Walton took out his patent, and in 1871 [[William Parnacott]] took out a patent for a method of producing linoxyn by blowing hot air into a tank of linseed oil for several hours, then cooling the material in trays. Unlike Walton's process, which took weeks, Parnacott's method took only a day or two, although the quality of the linoxyn was not as good. Despite this, many manufacturers opted to use the less expensive Parnacott process.\n\nWalton soon faced competition from other manufacturers, including a company which bought the rights to Parnacott's process, and launched its own floor covering, which it named Corticine, from the Latin \"cortex\" (bark or rind). Corticine was mainly made of cork dust and linoxyn without a cloth backing, and became popular because it was cheaper than linoleum.\n\nBy 1869 Walton's factory in [[Staines]], England was exporting to Europe and the United States. In 1877, the [[Scotland|Scottish]] town of [[Kirkcaldy]], in [[Fife]], became the largest producer of linoleum in the world, with no fewer than six floorcloth manufacturers in the town, most notably Michael Nairn & Co., which had been producing floorcloth since 1847.\n\nWalton opened the American Linoleum Manufacturing Company in 1872 on [[Staten Island]], in partnership with Joseph Wild, the company's town being named Linoleumville (renamed [[Travis, Staten Island|Travis]] in 1930).<ref name=lino23/> It was the first U.S. linoleum manufacturer, but was soon followed by the American Nairn Linoleum Company, established by Sir Michael Nairn in 1887 (later the Congoleum Nairn Company, and The Congoleum Corporation of America), in [[Kearny, New Jersey]].
