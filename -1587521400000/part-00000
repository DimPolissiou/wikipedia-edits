The library opened to the public on April 25, 1910 and immediately began lending its collection of nearly 5,200 items. Located in the center of town, the library provided Northfield with a central community space as well as a quiet place to read and borrow books. Throughout the first half of the 20th Century, the library made improvements including the addition of a card index for local newspaper, a repository for historical materials, and the creation of a popular \"Story Hour\" for children.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/962750416|title=The enduring thing we do today ... : a history of the Northfield Public Library, 1898-2016|last=William|first=Colwell, Bruce|isbn=9780996578233|location=Northfield, MN|oclc=962750416}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1950 and 1980, Northfield continued to grow and expand its collection to include materials like records, cassette tapes, and videos. Its well regarded children's department grew as well with new programs and added materials.

Minor renovations occurred throughout the 60s and 70s, but it wasn't until the mid 1980s that the library was able to expand. With help from the League of Women Voters, library staff successfully campaigned to pass a bonding referendum to add to the facility. In 1985, the library reopened with an additional 8,000 square feet and room for thousands of new materials.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBy 2009, nearly 75 percent of area residents had a library card, more than 400,000 items were checked out yearly, and roughly 600 people came through the doors every day. With these numbers and demand, the library began to explore the possibility of another addition. Under new director Teresa Jensen, the city and private fundraising efforts agreed upon a $3.1 million renovation to address structural and spatial issues.

This library, as well as its sister county library (the Cornelia branch) joined alongside the Stephens County Library Program to create the Habersham-Stephens Regional Library System in 1944.<ref name=\"History\">{{cite web|title=NEGRLS History|url=http://www.negeorgialibraries.org/home.html|accessdate=4 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Clarkesville library served as the regional headquarters for the system from 1928 until 2009 when it was replaced by the general NEGRLS processing center.<ref name=\"History\" />\n\n===Stephens County Library===\nThe next library created in current region was the Toccoa-Stephens County Library. It was established by the [[Works Progress Administration]] and first sponsored by the Toccoa Woman's Club on May 1, 1937. Initially the library was housed in a section of the local high school until it was moved after one year into space made available in the Woman's clubhouse. The Kiwanis Club and United Daughters of the Confederacy, as well as the Stephens County Commissioners also offered monetary support to the library in 1938, and by 1939 the WPA withdrew its involvement.<ref name=\"Stephens\">{{cite book|title=Stephens County Georgia and its People Vol. 1|date=1996|publisher=Walsworth Publishing|location=USA|page=42}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1940s the library was officially designated the Toccoa-Stephens County Public Library, and in the next three years moved to three different buildings before settling down in city hall until 1956. At this point the Woman's Club offered their clubhouse as a permanent space for the library as a gift to the city which was accepted.<ref name=\"Stephens\" />\n\nThe library joined the greater Northeast Georgia system in 1966. During this time space became limited in the old Woman's clubhouse and a new building was conceived. Dedicated in May 1970 the new $240,000 library more than doubled the space of the old library. Another addition in 1988 doubled the floor space of the library again.<ref name=\"Stephens\" />\n\n===White County===\nThe White County library joined in 1951, and with the introduction of White County the name of the library system was changed to its present form. In 1956 Rabun County joined the system, and a decade later, in 1966, the City of Toccoa joined. The current system has been made up of the same libraries since these last two additions.<ref name=\"History\" />\n\n==Branches==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Name !!

This library, as well as its sister county library (the Cornelia branch) joined alongside the Stephens County Library Program to create the Habersham-Stephens Regional Library System in 1944.<ref name=\"History\">{{cite web|title=NEGRLS History|url=http://www.negeorgialibraries.org/home.html|accessdate=4 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Clarkesville library served as the regional headquarters for the system from 1928 until 2009 when it was replaced by the general NEGRLS processing center.<ref name=\"History\" />\n\n===Stephens County Library===\nThe next library created in current region was the Toccoa-Stephens County Library. It was established by the [[Works Progress Administration]] and first sponsored by the Toccoa Woman's Club on May 1, 1937. Initially the library was housed in a section of the local high school until it was moved after one year into space made available in the Woman's clubhouse. The Kiwanis Club and United Daughters of the Confederacy, as well as the Stephens County Commissioners also offered monetary support to the library in 1938, and by 1939 the WPA withdrew its involvement.<ref name=\"Stephens\">{{cite book|title=Stephens County Georgia and its People Vol. 1|date=1996|publisher=Walsworth Publishing|location=USA|page=42}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1940s the library was officially designated the Toccoa-Stephens County Public Library, and in the next three years moved to three different buildings before settling down in city hall until 1956. At this point the Woman's Club offered their clubhouse as a permanent space for the library as a gift to the city which was accepted.<ref name=\"Stephens\" /> \n\nThe library joined the greater Northeast Georgia system in 1966. During this time space became limited in the old Woman's clubhouse and a new building was conceived. Dedicated in May 1970 the new $240,000 library more than doubled the space of the old library. Another addition in 1988 doubled the floor space of the library again.<ref name=\"Stephens\" /> \n\n===White County===\nThe White County library joined in 1951, and with the introduction of White County the name of the library system was changed to its present form. In 1956 Rabun County joined the system, and a decade later, in 1966, the City of Toccoa joined. The current system has been made up of the same libraries since these last two additions.<ref name=\"History\" />\n\n==Branches==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Name !!

[[Superleague Greece|Super League]]. They also competed in [[2007\u201308 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] and [[2007-08 Greek Football Cup|Greek Cup]]. Season started with [[Jos\u00e9 Peseiro]] as team manager. In summer of 2007 many players left the club including [[Igor Bi\u0161\u0107an]] and [[V\u00edctor S\u00e1nchez (footballer, born 1976)|V\u00edctor S\u00e1nchez]] who hadn't fulfilled the expectations of Panathinaikos' fans with their performance. On the other end the return of [[Giorgos Karagounis]] after four years pulled the spotlight and considered one of the most important signings of the 2007 summer transfer window. Panathinaikos also signed Brazilian [[midfielder]] [[Marcelo Mattos]] from [[Sport Club Corinthians Paulista|Corinthians]], [[Dame N'Doye]] from [[Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Acad\u00e9mica de Coimbra \u2013 O.A.F.|Academica]], [[Josu Sarriegi]] from [[Athletic Bilbao]] and some other players to help the team win its first championship in four years and celebrate the club's centesimal anniversary in the most appropriate way.\n\nThe championship began with Panathinaikos collecting seven points in the first three matchdays, having already played two derbies against [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]] (0\u20130) and [[P.A.O.K. F.C.|PAOK]] (2\u20130).\n\n==Squad==\n''As of 24 February 2008.''<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.pao.gr/team.php?category_id=50 |title=Panathinaikos F.C. 2007/08 squad numbers |publisher=pao.gr |access-date=2008-04-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417232517/http://www.pao.gr/team.php?category_id=50 |archive-date=2009-04-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Fs player|no=1|nat=Croatia|name=[[Mario Galinovi\u0107]]|pos=GK}}\n{{fs player|no=2|nat=Nigeria|pos=DF|name=[[Joseph Enakarhire]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=3|nat=Spain|name=[[Josu Sarriegi]]|pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player|no=4|nat=Brazil|name=[[Marcelo Mattos]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=5|nat=South Africa|name=[[Nasief Morris]]|pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player|no=6|nat=Greece|name=[[Filipos Darlas]]|pos=DF}}\n{{Fs player|no=7|nat=Greece|name=[[Sotiris Ninis]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=8|nat=Greece|name=[[Yannis Goumas]]|pos=DF|other=[[Captain (association football)|captain]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=9|nat=Argentina|name=[[Sebasti\u00e1n Ariel Romero|Sebasti\u00e1n Romero]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=10|nat=Argentina|name=[[Ezequiel Gonz\u00e1lez]]|pos=MF}}\n{{Fs player|no=11|nat=Greece|name=[[Dimitris Papadopoulos (footballer)|Dimitris Papadopoulos]]|pos=FW|other=[[Captain (association football)|vice-captain]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=12|nat=Portugal|name=[[H\u00e9lder Postiga]]|pos=FW|other=on loan from [[F.C.

He connected with jewish history by based on religious narratives. According to Al- Ratrout, Barclay influenced by biblical background and did not pay attention to the early Muslim period of the gate.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n'''Architecture Features'''\n\nThe gate is a vaulted passageway with a single doorway measuring 5.06 metres in width and 8.80 metres in height from its flat lintel to its threshold. The ratio between width and height of the doorway is generated from the successive progression of the square series. Warren noticed that the inner face of the lintel is concealed by a flat arch of 5 stones. The researcher of this thesis re-examined the gate; he noticed that the stone courses on each side of the Gate are not on the same level. The stones of the gate, as first suggested by Wilson and confirmed by Warren, are not really in-situ,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Claude Conder|first=Charrles Warren|url=https://archive.org/details/surveyofwesternp00warruoft/page/n3/mode/2up/search/hitta|title=The Survey of Western Palestine|publisher=Published for the Committee of the Palestine Exploration Fund|year=1884|isbn=|location=London|pages=188,192}}</ref> which indicates that it was constructed with reused stones. Concerning the history of this gate before the early Islamic period, it is useless to speculate because there is no clear evidence.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nFrom an archaeological point of view, this gate certainly served as an entrance to al- Aqsa Mosque in the early Islamic period. This view emerged after Ben-Dov uncovered a sewage channel outside the western wall of al-Aqsa Mosque that runs close to the threshold of this gate under the street that was level with the threshold.<ref name=\":2\" /> Since the pavement and the channel date back to the early Islamic period, this gate must have been in use in the Umayyad period. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Ben-Dov|first=Meir|url=https://archive.org/details/inshadowoftemp00bend/page/12|title=In the Shadow of the Temple: The Discovery of Ancient Jerusalem|publisher=Keter Publishing House|year=1985|isbn=|location=Israel|pages=142}}</ref>Early traditions which can certainly be dated to the umayyad period mention Bab H\u0131ttah. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Elad|first=Amikam|title=Medieval Jerusalem and Islamic Worship: Holy Places, Ceremonies, Pilgrimage|publisher=Brill|year=1999|isbn=9004100105|location=Netherlands|pages=50}}</ref>The gate leads to the level of the enclave through a passageway of two intersected wings; it forms an inverted L-shape in plan. The line of the passage runs eastward some 24.50 metres at right angles from the gate, and then it continues some 13 metres to the south parallel to the Burak Wall of the enclave.<ref name=\":2\" /> According to Jacobson and Gibson an Umayyad attribution for the arm of the passage rising to the south makes sense for several reasons. It is now becoming clear that the Umayyad period saw a major reconstruction of the entire Al-Haram Al-Sharif enclosure and not simply the construction of the major buildings within, namely the Dome of the Rock and the al-Aqsa Mosque.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Shimon Gibson|first=David M. Jacobson|date=1997|title=The Original Form Of Barclay's Gate|url=|journal=Palestine Exploration Quarterly|volume=129|pages=138-149|via=}}</ref>\n\nMore than one type of roofing can be distinguished in the passage. Adjacent to the Gate, there is a segmental barrel vault with a chamfered edge spanning an adjacent space measuring 5.76 metres in width and rising 1.20 metres. It has been delineated with the help of the radius of the circle that circumscribes the square. This vault is followed by another vault of a hemispherical barrel shape for the passage, measuring 6.20 metres in width and rising 3.10 metres high. At the meeting point of the E-W and N-S passages, a shallow dome was used to cover the junction; originally it possibly rests on the side walls and on three distinct segmental arch of chamfered edges, two of them still surviving today. <ref name=\":2\" />[[Image:Jerusalem KingFaisalGate J59r.jpg|thumb|200px|Bab al-'Attam (Gate of Darkness)]]\n===Gate of Darkness===\nThe '''Gate of Darkness''', ({{lang-ar|\u0628\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u062a\u0645 ,Bab al-Atim}}), is one of the three gates located on the north side.

Also, Muslims coming to Masjid al-Aqsa from the Al-Khalil Gate mostly use this gate. Its name is derived from the fact that the gate leads out to the Cotton Bazaar. On the other hand, since the cotton grown on the coastline is marketed in this bazaar, the name of this bazaar is called Cotton Bazaar. This bazaar consists of many shops side by side. Its length is 95 meters.

The door is currently open and the date of its construction dates back to the Ayyubid period.It is a large door with two wings decorated with intertwined motifs on wood, and when its wings are closed, there is a small door on one of the wings that a person can enter. This door was renewed in the Ayyubid period in h.600 / m.1200. Silsile Gate is one of the double doors built side by side. It was built as a double door with the adjacent Sekine Gate.

An alternate theory holds that it was built in the later part of the 7th century by [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] artisans employed by the [[Umayyad]] [[khalif]]s. It has two vaulted halls which lead to the Door of Mercy, Bab al-Rahma, and the Door of Repentance, Bab al-Taubah. Closed by the Muslims in 810, reopened in 1102 by the Crusaders, it was walled up by Saladin after regaining Jerusalem in 1187. [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] rebuilt it together with the city walls, but walled it up in 1541, and it stayed that way until today.<ref>Dr. J. Randall Price, ''Rose Guide To The Temple''.

By June 2017, the catalog consisted of books from 284 [[library]] facilities in 143 [[List of counties in Georgia (U.S. state)|counties]] across the U.S. state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] with a collection size of 10.6 million items, all of which are searchable by anyone with a PINES library card which can be obtained free of charge from any PINES-participating library.<ref name=\"pinesdatasheet\">{{cite web|url=https://pines.georgialibraries.org/about|title=PINES: Georgia's Statewide Library Card|date=2010-02-15|publisher=Georgia Public Library Service|accessdate=11 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe PINES system effectively turns most of the state of Georgia into one huge library. PINES cardholders are able to request an [[interlibrary loan]] from any affiliated library, and the single statewide library card grants access to the hundreds of branches associated with the service. PINES also manages the booking of rooms, the use of remote self-check machines, allows automated search and retrieval, as well as supports [[RSS]] and [[Schema.org]] standards.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Isard|first1=Robin|title=Confessions of a systems librarian|url=https://opensource.com/education/15/1/open-source-profession-systems-librarian|accessdate=10 June 2017|publisher=opensource.com|date=January 28, 2015}}</ref>\n\nPINES developed the [[open-source software]] [[Evergreen (software)|Evergreen]], an [[integrated library system]] which it and other library consortia use to manage their online catalogs.\n\n==History==\n===PINES Development===\nIn 1998 a [[white paper]] was created exploring the feasibility of a statewide public library card for Georgia. As Georgia had consistently ranked among the lowest states in public library funding per capita it was agreed that a universal library card could be of great benefit to the residents of Georgia as long as the affiliated libraries were unified under one single [[integrated library system]] (ILS).<ref>{{cite web|title=Capital Expenditures (per capita) (most recent) by state|url=http://www.statemaster.com/graph/edu_pub_lib_cap_exp_percap-libraries-capital-expenditures-per-capita|website=StateMaster|accessdate=10 June 2017}}</ref> It was also believed that by establishing a state-wide library cost to individual library systems would be lowered as they wouldn't need to maintain their own integrated library systems, and certain tasks could be centralized through the state saving additional time.<ref name=\"Whitepaper\">{{cite book|last1=Walker|first1=Julie|last2=Veatch|first2=Lamar|title=White Paper PINES/Evergreen/Equinox|date=August 13, 2009|publisher=Georgia Public Library Service|pages=12|url=https://pines.georgialibraries.org/sites/default/files/files/WhitePaper-PINES-Evergreen-Equinox-8-09.pdf|accessdate=10 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nBy 1999 PINES became a reality, administered by the current [[Georgia Public Library Service]] (GPLS). It initially was used as a [[Year 2000 problem|Y2K]] state-funded project to address needs of public libraries without Y2K-compliant ILS computer services. These libraries, mostly rural, were deemed not to have programs that would survive into the 21st century. Some libraries were still not automated as well. The PINES initiative would give these libraries access first, bringing their services into the modern era.<ref name=\"Whitepaper\" /> Looking to complete the project before the year 2000, on April 8, 1999 the initial contract to develop the ILS was awarded to [[KPMG Consulting Inc]] partnered with the SIRSI Corporation and [[Sun Microsystems]].\n\nIn December 1999 the new software was finished and ready for deployment. In that same month Phase 1 of PINES went live with 98 affiliated libraries. For the next two years other libraries saw the success of PINES, and rather than replace their outdated ILS with a new independent one, requested to join the statewide system. In 2001 Phase 2 of PINES went live with an addition 111 libraries joining the service.<ref name=\"Whitepaper\" />\n\n===Evergreen Development===\nIn 2004 the GPLS decided not to renew their contract with KPMG/Sirsi after being advised that under the current software no more libraries would be able to be added to the system. As a result the GPLS explored the possibility of creating their own software, and on June 4, 2004 a press release by the state librarian outlined a two-year development plan for a new PINES ILS software called [[Evergreen (software)|Evergreen]].<ref name=\"Whitepaper\" />\n\nThe new ILS was completed and ready to go live in September 2006. On September 1, the Sirsi ILS was taken offline, and by September 5 Evergreen was up and running. Due to the success of Evergreen it was awarded the Mellon Award for Technology Collaboration in 2007 by the [[Andrew W.

By June 2017, the catalog consisted of books from 284 [[library]] facilities in 143 [[List of counties in Georgia (U.S. state)|counties]] across the U.S. state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] with a collection size of 10.6 million items, all of which are searchable by anyone with a PINES library card which can be obtained free of charge from any PINES-participating library.<ref name=\"pinesdatasheet\">{{cite web|url=https://pines.georgialibraries.org/about|title=PINES: Georgia's Statewide Library Card|date=2010-02-15|publisher=Georgia Public Library Service|accessdate=11 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe PINES system effectively turns most of the state of Georgia into one huge library. PINES cardholders are able to request an [[interlibrary loan]] from any affiliated library, and the single statewide library card grants access to the hundreds of branches associated with the service. PINES also manages the booking of rooms, the use of remote self-check machines, allows automated search and retrieval, as well as supports [[RSS]] and [[Schema.org]] standards.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Isard|first1=Robin|title=Confessions of a systems librarian|url=https://opensource.com/education/15/1/open-source-profession-systems-librarian|accessdate=10 June 2017|publisher=opensource.com|date=January 28, 2015}}</ref>\n\nPINES developed the [[open-source software]] [[Evergreen (software)|Evergreen]], an [[integrated library system]] which it and other library consortia use to manage their online catalogs.\n\n==History==\n===PINES Development===\nIn 1998 a [[white paper]] was created exploring the feasibility of a statewide public library card for Georgia. As Georgia had consistently ranked among the lowest states in public library funding per capita it was agreed that a universal library card could be of great benefit to the residents of Georgia as long as the affiliated libraries were unified under one single [[integrated library system]] (ILS).<ref>{{cite web|title=Capital Expenditures (per capita) (most recent) by state|url=http://www.statemaster.com/graph/edu_pub_lib_cap_exp_percap-libraries-capital-expenditures-per-capita|website=StateMaster|accessdate=10 June 2017}}</ref> It was also believed that by establishing a state-wide library cost to individual library systems would be lowered as they wouldn't need to maintain their own integrated library systems, and certain tasks could be centralized through the state saving additional time.<ref name=\"Whitepaper\">{{cite book|last1=Walker|first1=Julie|last2=Veatch|first2=Lamar|title=White Paper PINES/Evergreen/Equinox|date=August 13, 2009|publisher=Georgia Public Library Service|pages=12|url=https://pines.georgialibraries.org/sites/default/files/files/WhitePaper-PINES-Evergreen-Equinox-8-09.pdf|accessdate=10 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nBy 1999 PINES became a reality, administered by the current [[Georgia Public Library Service]] (GPLS). It initially was used as a [[Year 2000 problem|Y2K]] state-funded project to address needs of public libraries without Y2K-compliant ILS computer services. These libraries, mostly rural, were deemed not to have programs that would survive into the 21st century. Some libraries were still not automated as well. The PINES initiative would give these libraries access first, bringing their services into the modern era.<ref name=\"Whitepaper\" /> Looking to complete the project before the year 2000, on April 8, 1999 the initial contract to develop the ILS was awarded to [[KPMG Consulting Inc]] partnered with the SIRSI Corporation and [[Sun Microsystems]].\n\nIn December of 1999 the new software was finished and ready for deployment. In that same month Phase 1 of PINES went live with 98 affiliated libraries. For the next two years other libraries saw the success of PINES, and rather than replace their outdated ILS with a new independent one, requested to join the statewide system. In 2001 Phase 2 of PINES went live with an addition 111 libraries joining the service.<ref name=\"Whitepaper\" />\n\n===Evergreen Development===\nIn 2004 the GPLS decided not to renew their contract with KPMG/Sirsi after being advised that under the current software no more libraries would be able to be added to the system. As a result the GPLS explored the possibility of creating their own software, and on June 4, 2004 a press release by the state librarian outlined a two-year development plan for a new PINES ILS software called [[Evergreen (software)|Evergreen]].<ref name=\"Whitepaper\" />\n\nThe new ILS was completed and ready to go live in September of 2006. On September 1, the Sirsi ILS was taken offline, and by September 5 Evergreen was up and running. Due to the success of Evergreen it was awarded the Mellon Award for Technology Collaboration in 2007 by the [[Andrew W.
