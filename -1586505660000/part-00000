He debuted for them in 1919 and became Kiwi number 125<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Kiwis Roll of Honour\n| publisher = New Zealand Rugby League\n| url =https://nzrl.co.nz/kiwis-home/past-kiwis/\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He played his club rugby league for the [[Grafton Athletic]] and [[Newton Rangers]] teams in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. He later moved to [[Tauranga]] and played for Tauranga and [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] at rugby union including against the touring [[Springbok national rugby union team|Springbok]] team in 1921.\n\n==Early Life==\nGeorge Iles grew up in [[Christchurch]]. He was the son of Harriet and Albert Iles, whose parents had come to New Zealand in one of the first \u201cfour ships\u201d which brought settlers to [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Obituary/Mr Albert Iles\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LV, Issue 9359\n| date = 1926-12-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19261209.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-09}}</ref>.\nAlbert was a successful sportsman in his own right captaining the Sydenham Football Club in the 1880s and representing [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]] and [[Rugby Southland|Southland]] for several years. He was also a champion runner. In 1912 the family moved to [[Auckland]] where they lived until 1919 and it was during these years that George made a name for himself as a rugby league player.\n\n==Rugby League and Rugby Union Playing Career==\n===Auckland and New Zealand Rugby League Days===\nGeorge Iles began his playing career for [[Grafton Athletic]] with his name first appearing in a team list for their second grade team in 1914 along with his brother Arthur Iles <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Under League Rules/Fixtures and Teams/Grafton Club\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LI, Issue 15621\n| date = 1914-05-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140529.2.132.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The following season he debuted for the Grafton senior team and played in the [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|Auckland first grade competition]]. He was fortunate to play alongside the likes of New Zealand rugby league legends [[Karl Ifwersen]] and [[Dougie McGregor]], the later having already played for the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] rugby team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game Notes and Comments\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LII, Issue 15915\n| date = 1915-05-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19150512.2.124.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Grafton were to win the Auckland title [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|this season]].\n\nBoth George and Arthur were to transfer to the [[Newton Rangers]] team for the [[1916 Auckland Rugby League season|1916 season]]. Newton struggled and finished last however Iles did score 7 out of Newton\u2019s 20 tries making him the second highest try scorer for the entire competition. The following year he went even better scoring 12 tries and leading the try scorer lists in the [[1917 Auckland Rugby League season|1917 competition]].\n\nIn 1918 Iles scored 4 tries for Newton and was also elected secretary of the club at their annual meeting<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Newton Rangers Club\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16814\n| date = 1918-04-03\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180403.2.60\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He gained his first representative jersey when he was selected for the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] team for, at that time, a very rare representative fixture. During the war years the [[Auckland Rugby League]] had deliberately played almost no representative matches. The match was against [[Canterbury rugby league team|Canterbury]] and played at the [[Auckland Domain]] in front of 10,000 spectators. Auckland won 45-9 with Iles scoring a try in the corner \u201cafter a cross-field run\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland Defeats Canterbury/Forty-Five Points to Nine\n| page =3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16956\n| date = 1918-09-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180916.2.15.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>.\n\nOnce again in [[1919 Auckland Rugby League season|1919]] Iles was a prolific try scorer for Newton notching 10 tries in total including tries in the Roope Rooster semi final against [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]], and the semi final replay against the same opponents when the first match was abandoned near the end after Ponsonby fans encroached on the field and refused to move. Newton went on to win the Roope Rooster for the first time in their clubs history<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Roope Rooster Competition/Final Won by Newton/Game Played in Downpour\n| page =4\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17253\n| date = 1919-09-01\n| url = https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190901.2.9.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-20}}</ref>. \n\nIles was picked to play for Auckland against New Zealand on May 24. It was the first of 3 games he would play for them this season. The match was a warmup for the Australian Tour for the New Zealand side and was won by New Zealand 25-19 in front of 8,000 spectators at the [[Auckland Domain]] <ref>{{cite news\n| title =New Zealand Beats Auckland/Keenly Contested Game\n| page =9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17170\n| date = 1919-05-26\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190526.2.105.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>. His next appearance was against the Returned Soldiers team as part of the Peace Day celebration program. It was held at the Auckland Domain on July 20 and featured athletics, rugby union, rugby league, football, and hockey matches. The Returned Soldiers team won 26-24 with Iles scoring two second half tries for the losing Auckland team<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Northern Union Grade\n| page =9\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume L, Issue 172\n| date = 1919-07-22\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19190722.2.130\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>. His last ever match in an Auckland jersey was played against [[Rugby League Hawkes Bay|Hawke\u2019s Bay]] at [[Eden Park]] on August 9 with 9,000 watching on. Iles scored two more tries. The first after receiving a pass from [[Bert Laing]] and \u201ccutting in neatly and scoring\u201d, while his second saw him picking up the ball in the open \u201coutpacing the opposition and swerving past McCarthy [to score] a good try\u201d<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Representative Match/Auckland V Hawke\u2019s Bay\n| page =9\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17235\n| date = 1911-08-11\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190811.2.111.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-18}}</ref>.\n\nIles was to make his [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] debut two weeks later. He played all of his 4 matches for New Zealand in 4 consecutive weekends. New Zealand had sent a touring team to [[Australia]] where they had played 11 matches against various teams but no tests<ref>{{cite news\n| title = All Blacks Tour 1919\n| publisher = Rugby League Project\n| url = https://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/all-blacks-tour-1919/summary.html\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. After this tour they returned home and [[Australia national rugby league team|Australia]] sent a touring team to New Zealand<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Kangaroos Tour 1919\n| publisher = Rugby League Project\n| url = https://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/kangaroos-tour-1919/summary.html\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Iles had played in a trial on May 14 to make the tour but was not selected.\n\nOn August 23 he played his first test for New Zealand at the [[Basin Reserve]] in [[Wellington]] and went down 21-44 in front of 8,000 spectators<ref>{{cite news\n| title = League Football/Australia V New Zealand\n| page = 7\n| publisher = Dominion, Volume 12, Issue 282\n| date = 1919-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/DOM19190825.2.88\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Iles had a happier time of it in the second test which New Zealand won at Sydenham Park in [[Christchurch]]. Iles scored a try which was described \u201cfollowing an exchange of kicks between the two full-backs the New Zealanders swept down in a line and Iles got over\u201d, this made the score 21-2 to New Zealand. They would go on to win 26-10 in front of 6,000<ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game/Australia v New Zealand/Visitors Outclassed\n| page = 7\n| publisher = Dominion, Volume 12, Issue 288\n| date = 1919-09-01\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/DOM19190901.2.78\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The third test was played in Auckland at the Domain with a huge crowd of 24,300 present to see New Zealand go down 23-34<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Third League Test/Australia v New Zealand/Win for the Visitors/Score 34 Points to 23/Fast and Open Game\n| page = 9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17259\n| date = 1919-09-08\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190908.2.119\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. While Iles 4th and final appearance for New Zealand came at the Auckland Domain once again with New Zealand being trounced 2-32 to lose the series 1-3<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Australia v New Zealand\n| page = 9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17265\n| date = 1919-09-15\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190915.2.130\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Iles was listed to play in the reserves a week later for the Auckland team to play Australia but he did not take the field in an 8-32 loss.\n\n===Move to Tauranga and Switch to Rugby Union===\nIn 1920 George Iles moved to Tauranga with his family. There because rugby league was barely played he largely played rugby union over the following decade for Tauranga and the [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] representative team. In July 1920 he played for Tauranga against Grammar Old Boys. It was said \u201cof the Tauranga team the Isles [sic] brothers, three quarters, played well, and if supported by other members of the back division, would have made things a bit more awkward for the visitors. They both handled the ball well\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Grammar Old Boys v Tauranga\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Observer, Volume XL, Issue 45\n| date = 1920-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TO19200710.2.13.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. In September of 1920 Iles made a return to [[Eden Park]], this time in a Bay of Plenty rugby jersey where they were defeated 17-34 to Auckland. Iles set up Bay of Plenty\u2019s first try and then scored two himself<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Auckland V Bay of Plenty/The Visitors Defeated\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVII, Issue 17580\n| date = 1920-09-20\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19200920.2.106\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nIn a 1921 match for Tauranga Iles scored a try against Mercury Bay <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Match at Tauranga\n| page = 9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVIII, Issue 17836\n| date = 1921-07-18\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19210718.2.110.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He also played for Tauranga against Te Puke and despite recently joining the rugby code was named captain\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Kusabs' Cup Match Next Saturday\n| page =3\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7710\n| date = 1921-06-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210602.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. However on the 16th of August he was selected to play for Bay of Plenty against the touring Springbok team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7773\n| date = 1921-08-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210816.2.5\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The match was played at [[Rotorua]] with 5,000 spectators present to witness the Springboks win by 17 points to 9. Iles helped set up the first try to David Werahiko Borell after he initiated a \u201cnice attack\u201d and he did the same for their second and final try when Montgomery \u201csent the ball across to Iles who opened up splendidly, and the ball came across to Borell, who scored near the corner\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Springboks Beat Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7781\n| date = 1921-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210825.2.13\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\n===Effort to Introduce Rugby League to Tauranga===\nDespite these fine rugby achievements it appears that Iles had not forgotten his rugby league background. He was part of an effort to establish rugby league in the [[Tauranga]] area in 1922. The Tauranga Rugby League was started and they looked to play rugby league teams from other areas. The league was officially formed in March, 1922 <ref>{{cite news| title = Under League Rules/Decisions of Executive\n| page = 3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LIX, Issue 18053, 30 March 1922, Page 3\n| date = 1922-03-30\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19220330.2.16.8\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.

On April 12 he wrote a letter to the [[Bay of Plenty Times]] about the strength of the rugby league code in various places and was writing in response to a query about why rugby league had been started in the area by Mr. Phelan, a past member of the Tauranga rugby selection committee.

He was the son of Harriet and Albert Iles, whose parents had come to New Zealand in one of the first \u201cfour ships\u201d which brought settlers to [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Obituary/Mr Albert Iles\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LV, Issue 9359\n| date = 1926-12-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19261209.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-09}}</ref>.\nAlbert was a successful sportsman in his own right captaining the Sydenham Football Club in the 1880s and representing [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]] and [[Rugby Southland|Southland]] for several years. He was also a champion runner. In 1912 the family moved to [[Auckland]] where they lived until 1919 and it was during these years that George made a name for himself as a rugby league player.\n\n==Rugby League and Rugby Union Playing Career==\n===Auckland and New Zealand Rugby League Days===\nGeorge Iles began his playing career for [[Grafton Athletic]] with his name first appearing in a team list for their second grade team in 1914 along with his brother Arthur Iles <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Under League Rules/Fixtures and Teams/Grafton Club\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LI, Issue 15621\n| date = 1914-05-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140529.2.132.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The following season he debuted for the Grafton senior team and played in the [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|Auckland first grade competition]]. He was fortunate to play alongside the likes of New Zealand rugby league legends [[Karl Ifwersen]] and [[Dougie McGregor]], the later having already played for the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] rugby team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game Notes and Comments\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LII, Issue 15915\n| date = 1915-05-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19150512.2.124.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Grafton were to win the Auckland title [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|this season]].\n\nBoth George and Arthur were to transfer to the [[Newton Rangers]] team for the [[1916 Auckland Rugby League season|1916 season]]. Newton struggled and finished last however Iles did score 7 out of Newton\u2019s 20 tries making him the second highest try scorer for the entire competition. The following year he went even better scoring 12 tries and leading the try scorer lists in the [[1917 Auckland Rugby League season|1917 competition]].\n\nIn 1918 Iles scored 4 tries for Newton and was also elected secretary of the club at their annual meeting<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Newton Rangers Club\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16814\n| date = 1918-04-03\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180403.2.60\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He gained his first representative jersey when he was selected for the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] team for, at that time, a very rare representative fixture. During the war years the [[Auckland Rugby League]] had deliberately played almost no representative matches. The match was against [[Canterbury rugby league team|Canterbury]] and played at the [[Auckland Domain]] in front of 10,000 spectators. Auckland won 45-9 with Iles scoring a try in the corner \u201cafter a cross-field run\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland Defeats Canterbury/Forty-Five Points to Nine\n| page =3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16956\n| date = 1918-09-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180916.2.15.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>.\n\nOnce again in [[1919 Auckland Rugby League season|1919]] Iles was a prolific try scorer for Newton notching 10 tries in total including tries in the Roope Rooster semi final against [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]], and the semi final replay against the same opponents when the first match was abandoned near the end after Ponsonby fans encroached on the field and refused to move.

His next appearance was against the Returned Soldiers team as part of the Peace Day celebration program.

Iles had played in a trial on May 14 to make the tour but was not selected.\n\nOn August 23 he played his first test for New Zealand at the [[Basin Reserve]] in [[Wellington]] and went down 21-44 in front of 8,000 spectators<ref>{{cite news\n| title = League Football/Australia V New Zealand\n| page = 7\n| publisher = Dominion, Volume 12, Issue 282\n| date = 1919-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/DOM19190825.2.88\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Iles had a happier time of it in the second test which New Zealand won at Sydenham Park in [[Christchurch]].

Iles was listed to play in the reserves a week later for the Auckland team to play Australia but he did not take the field in an 8-32 loss.\n\n===Move to Tauranga and Switch to Rugby Union===\nIn 1920 George Iles moved to Tauranga with his family. There because rugby league was barely played he largely played rugby union over the following decade for Tauranga and the [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] representative team. In July 1920 he played for Tauranga against Grammar Old Boys. It was said \u201cof the Tauranga team the Isles [sic] brothers, three quarters, played well, and if supported by other members of the back division, would have made things a bit more awkward for the visitors. They both handled the ball well\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Grammar Old Boys v Tauranga\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Observer, Volume XL, Issue 45\n| date = 1920-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TO19200710.2.13.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. In September of 1920 Iles made a return to [[Eden Park]], this time in a Bay of Plenty rugby jersey where they were defeated 17-34 to Auckland. Iles set up Bay of Plenty\u2019s first try and then scored two himself<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Auckland V Bay of Plenty/The Visitors Defeated\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVII, Issue 17580\n| date = 1920-09-20\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19200920.2.106\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nIn a 1921 match for Tauranga Iles scored a try against Mercury Bay <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Match at Tauranga\n| page = 9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVIII, Issue 17836\n| date = 1921-07-18\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19210718.2.110.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

However on the 16th of August he was selected to play for Bay of Plenty against the touring Springbok team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7773\n| date = 1921-08-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210816.2.5\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The match was played at [[Rotorua]] with 5,000 spectators present to witness the Springboks win by 17 points to 9. Iles helped set up the first try to David Werahiko Borell after he initiated a \u201cnice attack\u201d and he did the same for their second and final try when Montgomery \u201csent the ball across to Iles who opened up splendidly, and the ball came across to Borell, who scored near the corner\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Springboks Beat Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7781\n| date = 1921-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210825.2.13\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\n===Effort to Introduce Rugby League to Tauranga===\nDespite these fine rugby achievements it appears that Iles had not forgotten his rugby league background. He was part of an effort to establish rugby league in the [[Tauranga]] area in 1922. The Tauranga Rugby League was started and they looked to play rugby league teams from other areas. The league was officially formed in March, 1922 <ref>{{cite news| title = Under League Rules/Decisions of Executive\n| page = 3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LIX, Issue 18053, 30 March 1922, Page 3\n| date = 1922-03-30\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19220330.2.16.8\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. They made efforts to organise a game with the newly formed Rotorua league team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8079\n| date = 1922-09-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220902.2.4\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. On April 12 he wrote a letter to the [[Bay of Plenty Times]] about the strength of the rugby league code in various places and was writing in response to a query about why rugby league had been started in the area by Mr. Phelan, a past member of the Tauranga rugby selection committee. Iles responded in a lengthy letter \u201cthe answer is the same as that to why the League game was first commenced \u2013 that is dissatisfaction with Rugby management\u201d, he went on to say \u201ctouching on the standard of play in League, as one who has played both codes I give it as my opinion that League is played on a far higher standard in [[Australia]] and [[Auckland]] than Rugby\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Public Opinion/Rival Codes\n| page = 4\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 7961\n| date = 1922-04-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220413.2.27\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

On August 28 he wrote another letter suggesting a match between those players who had been selected for the Tauranga rugby union team and those who had not as there had evidently been some controversy over selections<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Challenge\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 8075\n| date = 1922-08-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220829.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nOn September 30 Tauranga made history of sorts by playing in the first ever rugby league game in Te Puke<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.3\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. Efforts were then made to arrange a match with an Auckland team and this eventuated with Auckland sending a very strong team down to play in Tauranga on October 7. It wasn\u2019t a Tauranga side who took on Auckland rather a Bay of Plenty team with players from the district. George Iles captained the Bay of Plenty side and they performed well only going down 27-33 to an Auckland team which featured a large number of New Zealand international players such as [[Clarrie Polson]], [[Wally Somers]], and future Kiwi\u2019s [[Lou Brown (rugby league)|Lou Brown]], [[Neville St George]], and [[James Lawrence O\u2019Brien|Jim Brown]].<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland League Team in Tauranga/Match Against Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| work = Bay of Plenty Times| volume=LI| issue=8109\n| date = 1922-10-07\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19221007.2.15\n| accessdate = 2020-03-11}}</ref>. Iles scored a try against his former team.\n\nIn September Iles went on the attack again, this time in response to the suggestion by rugby supporters that league players were being paid. He was writing as a member of Tauranga Rugby League and challenged \u201cany member of the Rugby Union to produce evidence of proof of any monetary benefits received by players or officers of the Tauranga Rugby League. If this can be done I will donate \u00a350 to any charity benefit. <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Matters\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. These effort to grow the game in the area ultimately proved futile and Iles returned to the rugby union field the following season.\n\n===Back to Rugby Union===\nIn 1923 he played for Tauranga rugby team against Te Puke in Te Puke and then again in the return match in Tauranga.

The trachea extends from the larynx and branches into the two [[primary bronchus|primary bronchi]]. At the top of the trachea the [[cricoid cartilage]] attaches it to the larynx. This is the only complete tracheal ring, the others being incomplete rings of reinforcing cartilage. The [[trachealis muscle]] joins the ends of the rings and these are joined vertically by bands of fibrous [[connective tissue]] \u2013 the [[annular ligaments of trachea]].  The [[epiglottis]] closes the opening to the larynx during swallowing.\n\nThe trachea develops in the second month of development. It is lined with an [[epithelium]] that has [[goblet cell]]s which produce protective [[mucin]]s. An [[inflammation|inflammatory]] condition, also involving the larynx and [[bronchi]], called [[croup]] can result in a barking cough. A [[tracheotomy]] is often performed for ventilation in surgical operations where needed. [[Intubation]] is also carried out for the same reason by the inserting of a [[tracheal tube|tube]] into the trachea. \n\nThe word \"trachea\" is used to define a very different organ in [[invertebrate]]s than in vertebrates. Insects have an open [[respiratory system of insects|respiratory system]] made up of [[Spiracle (arthropods)|spiracles]], tracheae, and [[tracheole]]s to transport [[metabolism|metabolic]] gases to and from tissues.\n\n==Structure==\n[[File:Blausen 0865 TracheaAnatomy.png|thumb|left|240px]]\nAn adult's trachea has an inner diameter of about {{convert|1.5|to|2|cm|in}} and a length of about {{convert|10|to|11|cm|in}}; wider in males than females.<ref name=GA2016>{{Cite book|title=Gray's anatomy : the anatomical basis of clinical practice|editor=Standring, Susan|isbn=9780702052309|edition=41st|location=Philadelphia|oclc=920806541|year=2016|pp=965\u2013969|section=Trachea and bronchi}}</ref> It begins at the bottom of the [[larynx]], and ends at the [[Carina of trachea|carina]], the point where the trachea branches into left and right main [[bronchus|bronchi]].<ref name=GA2016 /> The trachea is surrounded by 16 - 22 rings of [[hyaline cartilage]]; these 'rings' are 4mm high in the adult, incomplete and C-shaped.<ref name=\"GA2016\" /> Ligaments connect the rings.<ref name=\"Furlow2018\" /> The [[trachealis muscle]] connects the ends of the incomplete rings and runs along the back wall of the trachea.<ref name=\"Furlow2018\" />\n\nThe trachea begins at the lower edge of the [[cricoid cartilage]] of the [[larynx]],<ref name=\"Furlow2018\" /> and ends at the [[Carina of trachea|carina]], the point where the trachea branches into left and right main [[bronchus|bronchi]].<ref name=\"GA2016\" /> The trachea begins level with the [[cervical vertebra 6|sixth cervical vertebra (C6)]] and the carina is found at the level of the fourth [[thoracic vertebra|thoracic vertebra (T4)]],<ref name=GA2016 /> although its position may change with breathing.<ref name=\"Furlow2018\" />\n\n=== Nearby structures ===\nThe trachea passes by many structures of the neck and thorax along its course.\n\nIn front of the upper trachea lies connective tissue and skin.<ref name=\"GA2016\" /> Several other structures pass over or sit on the trachea; the [[Jugular venous arch|jugular arch]], which joins the two [[anterior jugular vein]]s, sits in front of the upper part of the trachea.

The catheter is connected to a machine that monitors the airflow, oxygenation and several other metrics. This is often one of the responsibilities of an [[anesthetist]] during surgery.

The catheter is connected to a machine that monitors the airflow, oxygenation and several other metrics. This is often one of the responsibilities of an [[anesthetist]] during surgery. The [[epiglottic vallecula]] is an important anatomical landmark for carrying out this procedure.\n\nIn an emergency, or when tracheal intubation is deemed impossible, a [[tracheotomy]] is often performed to insert a tube for ventilation, usually when needed for particular types of surgery to be carried out so that the airway can be kept open. The provision of the opening via a tracheotomy is called a ''tracheostomy''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Molnar|first1=Heather|title=Types of Tracheostomy Tubes|url=http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/tracheostomy/about/types.html|language=en}}</ref>  Another less invasive method is used when a procedure can be carried out more quickly, or in an emergency situation, and this is a [[cricothyrotomy]].\n\n===Congenital disorders===\n[[File:Tracheal diverticulum.png|thumb|Tracheal diverticulum as seen on axial CT imaging]]\n[[Tracheal agenesis]]<ref>{{Cite journal \n| doi = 10.1097/00007611-199008000-00018 \n| last1 = Chiu | first1 = T. \n| last2 = Cuevas | first2 = D. \n| last3 = Cuevas | first3 = L. \n| last4 = Monteiro | first4 = C. \n| title = Tracheal agenesis \n| journal = Southern Medical Journal \n| volume = 83 \n| issue = 8 \n| pages = 925\u2013930 \n| year = 1990 \n| pmid = 2200137\n}}</ref> is a rare [[birth defect]] in which the trachea fails to develop.

It is estimated that as many as 10,000 people were buried there between 1829 and 1919 in seven independently administered denominations or sections which is why the place is known as 'East Perth Cemeteries'. Only around 800 [[Grave (burial)|gravesites]] have been identified. A large section of the original site has since been built over, leaving about 5 hectares (12.5 acres) remaining. \n\nThe site, which is a short distance from [[Gloucester Park, Perth|Gloucester Park]] and the [[WACA Ground]], is now bounded by [[Plain Street, East Perth]], Wittenoom Street, Bronte Street and Waterloo Crescent.\n\n==History==\n[[File:St Bartholmews East Perth.jpg|thumb|right|200px|St Bartholomew's Church. {{circa|1940}}; image is of the Western side]]\nThe cemetery site was surveyed by [[John Septimus Roe]] on 24 December 1829 soon after the central portions of the Perth townsite had been surveyed. The area was originally known as ''Cemetery Hill'' and was established in 1830. The first burial was of Private John Mitchell from the [[63rd Regiment of Foot|63rd regiment]]. Mitchell died on 6 January 1830; the exact location of his grave site is unknown.<ref>[http://www.ntwa.com.au/places/perthproperties/epcemeteriesHeritage.shtml National Trust] -- East Perth Cemeteries heritage information</ref> A public notice from [[Peter Broun]], the [[Colonial Secretary of Western Australia|Colonial Secretary]] on 13 February 1830 said: \"to prevent indiscriminate Burials and unpleasant consequences arising therefrom in a warm climate, a Burial Ground will be set apart in Every Township or Parish ... burials will take place in them only and a Register will be kept ... all Burials by the Chaplain will be restricted to times as soon after sunrise as possible, or an hour precisely before sunset...\" As it happened, both Broun and Roe were buried in the cemetery and their tombstones are still visible.\n\nThe Trustees of the [[Anglican Church of Australia|Church of England]] were granted Perth Town Lot R1 as a general cemetery in 1842. The cemetery was [[consecration|consecrated]] in 1848, and over the following decades sections of this were granted to various other denominations and ethnic groups with each cemetery being owned and controlled separately. The subsequent grants were: [[Roman Catholic]] (1848); \"[[Wesleyan]]ism\" (i.e. [[Methodist Church of Australasia|Methodist]]; 1854); [[Congregational]] (1854); \"[[Judaism|Hebrew]]\" (i.e. [[Jew]]ish 1867); [[Presbyterian Church of Australia|Presbyterian]] (1881); and [[Religion in China|Chinese]] (1888). Each of the grants were administered independently, with the exception of the Chinese section.\n\n[[File:East perth cemeteries 05 gnangarra.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Memorial to people of Chinese ethnicity who are buried in the cemeteries. A plaque on Bronte Street near the corner of Plain Street marks the location of the Chinese cemetery.]]\nIn 1899, [[Karrakatta Cemetery]] became the main burial ground in close proximity to Perth, and from July that year burials officially ceased at East Perth, except where special applications were made to use family graves. The cemetery was used intermittently from then until the last burial in 1919.\n\nThroughout most of the 1900s, the grounds, which adjoined an industrial area, were subject to vandalism and neglect.<ref>Veil. The Perth Cemetery. Description of overgrown, neglected cemetery. West Australian, 31 December 1896, p.9</ref> Appeals from individuals and the [[Royal Western Australian Historical Society]] for it to be refurbished given its historical significance continued over some time. In 1931, ''[[The Sunday Times (Western Australia)|The Sunday Times]]'' reported:\n\n<blockquote>\nWhen a representative of this paper visited the cemetery yesterday he found a skull almost intact, leg and arm bones, and other parts of poor mortal remains. These were lying on the rank green grass close to a bricked hole leading to the vault. From the ground above, the rest of the bones could be plainly seen.\n\nWhen the general public can depend upon viewing the actual remains of a dead person, and when mere children also have sight and access to such, it is time that someone in authority awakened.<ref>[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article58648159 Graveyard Scandal: CHILDREN PLAY IN FAMILY VAULTS AT EAST PERTH CEMETERY] ''[[The Sunday Times (Western Australia)|Sunday Times]]'' 24 May 1931, p.1</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn the 1930s, the various church authorities relinquished control of the individual grants and the entire site was then re-vested as [[Crown land]] and declared a disused burial ground.<ref>''East Perth Cemeteries & St. Bartholomew's Chapel'' Visitors booklet, National Trust of Australia.</ref> From the mid-1930s, control and responsibility for the grounds moved between various government departments and numerous projects were undertaken to refurbish the historic site.\n\nMuch of the area devoted to the Chinese, Jewish and Presbyterian sections was originally located west of Plain Street, and an unused Anglican section was located south of Bronte Street. In the late 1940s, these sections were excised and existing headstones removed. Some land west of Plain Street was used by the former [[Perth Girls' School]]. Fences separating the individual cemeteries were removed and those areas are now roadways, carparks and commercial and residential buildings. An access road called Forrest Avenue (previously Cemetery Road) crossed diagonally over the block which now houses the multi-storey [[Main Roads Western Australia|Main Roads]] office building. Extensions of Wickham and Horatio Streets have been incorporated into the grounds.\n\nA major redevelopment project in the late 1980s provided for landscaping and perimeter fencing to protect the church and remaining monuments from vandalism.\n\nIn 1994, the [[National Trust of Western Australia]] became responsible for the management and conservation of the East Perth Cemeteries after being approached by the [[Department of Conservation and Land Management (Western Australia)|Department of Conservation and Land Management]].<ref>Bodycoat, Ronald. (1992) ''The East Perth Cemeteries conservation plan: prepared for the National Trust of Australia (WA)'' Perth, W.A: National Trust of Australia, p 27</ref>\n\nThe East Perth Cemeteries are significant for the following reasons:\n\n* the place is a rare surviving group of colonial cemeteries which have retained a high degree of integrity and authenticity within the central business district of an Australian capital city\n\n* the place is associated with the growth of Perth from a small colonial community to a thriving metropolis and contains the graves from a cross-section of its first colonists from the 1830s \u2013 1890s. The place is also associated with a number of public servants and religious leaders who were important to the development of colonial Perth\n\n* the place displays the changes in headstone and cemetery design between 1830 \u2013 1899 and holds important genealogical information on many Western Australian families \n\n* the place contains the only mortuary chapel, constructed in Western Australia, which was later converted to function as a parish church and,\n\n* the place offers a landscape setting and experience of isolation, tranquility and simplicity that provides a rare contrast to the more verdant, intensely developed public landscapes within the City of Perth.<ref>National Trust of Australia (WA)</ref>\n\nThe National Trust of Australia (WA) is responsible for conservation works, landscape maintenance and education and learning programs for local schools. The Trust is reliant on grants for ongoing conservation works and also has the support of valued volunteers who act as guides and assist with conservation, maintenance and managing burial records. \n\nMuch of the retained burial ground lacks visible signs of graves or markers, partly because perishable timber crosses and monuments were used for burials of the poor.\n\n==St Bartholomew's Church==\n[[File:East perth cemeteries 11 gnangarra.jpg|thumb|right|200px|St Bartholomew's Church]]\n[[File:St.Bartholomew extn gnangarra.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Eastern wall of St Bartholomew's showing the difference in brick work from the 1900 extensions]]\nThe Anglican St Bartholomew's Church is the sole building still standing within the grounds.

These extensions were consecrated on 22 March 1900 by [[Charles Owen Leaver Riley]], the third Bishop of Perth.\n\nSt Batholomew's became a popular place of worship for many of the wealthier and predominantly Anglican households in the city which typically lived on [[Adelaide Terrace]] and overlooked the [[Swan River (Western Australia)|Swan River]].

It is estimated that as many as 10,000 people were buried there between 1829 and 1919 in seven independently administered denominations or sections which is why the place is known as 'East Perth Cemeteries'. Only around 800 [[Grave (burial)|gravesites]] have been identified. A large section of the original site has since been built over, leaving about 5 hectares (12.5 acres) remaining. \n\nThe site, which is a short distance from [[Gloucester Park, Perth|Gloucester Park]] and the [[WACA Ground]], is now bounded by [[Plain Street, East Perth]], Wittenoom Street, Bronte Street and Waterloo Crescent.\n\n==History==\n[[File:St Bartholmews East Perth.jpg|thumb|right|200px|St Bartholomew's Church. {{circa|1940}}; image is of the Western side]]\nThe cemetery site was surveyed by [[John Septimus Roe]] on 24 December 1829 soon after the central portions of the Perth townsite had been surveyed. The area was originally known as ''Cemetery Hill'' and was established in 1830. The first burial was of Private John Mitchell from the [[63rd Regiment of Foot|63rd regiment]]. Mitchell died on 6 January 1830; the exact location of his grave site is unknown.<ref>[http://www.ntwa.com.au/places/perthproperties/epcemeteriesHeritage.shtml National Trust] -- East Perth Cemeteries heritage information</ref> A public notice from [[Peter Broun]], the [[Colonial Secretary of Western Australia|Colonial Secretary]] on 13 February 1830 said: \"to prevent indiscriminate Burials and unpleasant consequences arising therefrom in a warm climate, a Burial Ground will be set apart in Every Township or Parish ... burials will take place in them only and a Register will be kept ... all Burials by the Chaplain will be restricted to times as soon after sunrise as possible, or an hour precisely before sunset...\" As it happened, both Broun and Roe were buried in the cemetery and their tombstones are still visible.\n\nThe Trustees of the [[Anglican Church of Australia|Church of England]] were granted Perth Town Lot R1 as a general cemetery in 1842. The cemetery was [[consecration|consecrated]] in 1848, and over the following decades sections of this were granted to various other denominations and ethnic groups with each cemetery being owned and controlled separately. The subsequent grants were: [[Roman Catholic]] (1848); \"[[Wesleyan]]ism\" (i.e. [[Methodist Church of Australasia|Methodist]]; 1854); [[Congregational]] (1854); \"[[Judaism|Hebrew]]\" (i.e. [[Jew]]ish 1867); [[Presbyterian Church of Australia|Presbyterian]] (1881); and [[Religion in China|Chinese]] (1888). Each of the grants were administered independently, with the exception of the Chinese section.\n\n[[File:East perth cemeteries 05 gnangarra.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Memorial to people of Chinese ethnicity who are buried in the cemeteries. A plaque on Bronte Street near the corner of Plain Street marks the location of the Chinese cemetery.]]\nIn 1899, [[Karrakatta Cemetery]] became the main burial ground in close proximity to Perth, and from July that year burials officially ceased at East Perth, except where special applications were made to use family graves. The cemetery was used intermittently from then until the last burial in 1919.\n\nThroughout most of the 1900s, the grounds, which adjoined an industrial area, were subject to vandalism and neglect.<ref>Veil. The Perth Cemetery. Description of overgrown, neglected cemetery. West Australian, 31 December 1896, p.9</ref> Appeals from individuals and the [[Royal Western Australian Historical Society]] for it to be refurbished given its historical significance continued over some time. In 1931, ''[[The Sunday Times (Western Australia)|The Sunday Times]]'' reported:\n\n<blockquote>\nWhen a representative of this paper visited the cemetery yesterday he found a skull almost intact, leg and arm bones, and other parts of poor mortal remains. These were lying on the rank green grass close to a bricked hole leading to the vault. From the ground above, the rest of the bones could be plainly seen.\n\nWhen the general public can depend upon viewing the actual remains of a dead person, and when mere children also have sight and access to such, it is time that someone in authority awakened.<ref>[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article58648159 Graveyard Scandal: CHILDREN PLAY IN FAMILY VAULTS AT EAST PERTH CEMETERY] ''[[The Sunday Times (Western Australia)|Sunday Times]]'' 24 May 1931, p.1</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn the 1930s, the various church authorities relinquished control of the individual grants and the entire site was then re-vested as [[Crown land]] and declared a disused burial ground.<ref>''East Perth Cemeteries & St. Bartholomew's Chapel'' Visitors booklet, National Trust of Australia.</ref> From the mid-1930s, control and responsibility for the grounds moved between various government departments and numerous projects were undertaken to refurbish the historic site.\n\nMuch of the area devoted to the Chinese, Jewish and Presbyterian sections was originally located west of Plain Street, and an unused Anglican section was located south of Bronte Street. In the late 1940s, these sections were excised and existing headstones removed. Some land west of Plain Street was used by the former [[Perth Girls' School]]. Fences separating the individual cemeteries were removed and those areas are now roadways, carparks and commercial and residential buildings. An access road called Forrest Avenue (previously Cemetery Road) crossed diagonally over the block which now houses the multi-storey [[Main Roads Western Australia|Main Roads]] office building. Extensions of Wickham and Horatio Streets have been incorporated into the grounds.\n\nA major redevelopment project in the late 1980s provided for landscaping and perimeter fencing to protect the church and remaining monuments from vandalism.\n\nIn 1994, the [[National Trust of Western Australia]] became responsible for the management and conservation of the East Perth Cemeteries after being approached by the [[Department of Conservation and Land Management (Western Australia)|Department of Conservation and Land Management]].<ref>Bodycoat, Ronald. (1992) ''The East Perth Cemeteries conservation plan: prepared for the National Trust of Australia (WA)'' Perth, W.A: National Trust of Australia, p 27</ref>\n\nThe East Perth Cemeteries are significant for the following reasons:\n\n* the place is a rare surviving group of colonial cemeteries which have retained a high degree of integrity and authenticity within the central business district of an Australian capital city\n\n* the place is associated with the growth of Perth from a small colonial community to a thriving metropolis and contains the graves from a cross-section of its first colonists from the 1830s \u2013 1890s. The place is also associated with a number of public servants and religious leaders who were important to the development of colonial Perth\n\n* the place displays the changes in headstone and cemetery design between 1830 \u2013 1899 and holds important genealogical information on many Western Australian families \n\n* the place contains the only mortuary chapel, constructed in Western Australia, which was later converted to function as a parish church and,\n\n* the place offers a landscape setting and experience of isolation, tranquility and simplicity that provides a rare contrast to the more verdant, intensely developed public landscapes within the City of Perth.<ref>National Trust of Australia (WA)</ref>\n\nThe National Trust of Australia (WA) is responsible for conservation works, landscape maintenance and education and learning programs for local schools. The Trust is reliant on grants for ongoing conservation works and also has the support of valued volunteers who act as guides and assist with conservation, maintenance and managing burial records. \n\nMuch of the retained burial ground lacks visible signs of graves or markers, partly because perishable timber crosses and monuments were used for burials of the poor.\n\n==St Bartholomew's Church==\n[[File:East perth cemeteries 11 gnangarra.jpg|thumb|right|200px|St Bartholomew's Church]]\n[[File:St.Bartholomew extn gnangarra.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Eastern wall of St Bartholomew's showing the difference in brick work from the 1900 extensions]]\nThe Anglican St Bartholomew's Church is the sole building still standing within the grounds.

These extensions were consecrated on 22 March 1900 by [[Charles Owen Leaver Riley]], the third Bishop of Perth.\n\nSt Batholomew's became a popular place of worship for many of the wealthier and predominantly Anglican households in the city which typically lived on [[Adelaide Terrace]] and overlooked the [[Swan River (Western Australia)|Swan River]].
