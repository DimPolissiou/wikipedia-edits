It is the first game in the [[Worms (series)|''Worms series'']] of video games.\n\n''Worms'' is a [[turn based]] game where a player controls a team of worms against other teams of worms that are controlled by a computer or human opponent. The aim is to use various weapons to kill the worms on the other teams and have the last surviving worm(s).\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:Worms scrapyardscreenshot.png|thumb|left|From the [[Amiga]] version: A [[scrapyard]] themed level, with the player using the [[blowtorch]] tool.]]\n''Worms'' is a turn based [[artillery game]], similar to other early games in the genre such as ''[[Scorched Earth (video game)|Scorched Earth]].\nEach player controls a team of several worms. During the course of the game, players take turns selecting one of their worms. They then use whatever tools and weapons are available to attack and kill the opponents' worms, thereby winning the game. Worms may move around the terrain in a variety of ways, normally by walking and jumping but also by using particular tools such as the \"Bungee\" and \"Ninja Rope\", to move to otherwise inaccessible areas. Each turn is time-limited to ensure that players do not hold up the game with excessive thinking or moving. The time limit can be modified in some of the games in the Worms series.\n\nOver fifty weapons and tools may be available each time a game is played, and differing selections of weapons and tools can be saved into a \"scheme\" for easy selection in future games. Other scheme settings allow options such as deployment of reinforcement crates, from which additional weapons can be obtained, and sudden death where the game is rushed to a conclusion after a time limit expires. Some settings provide for the inclusion of objects such as land mines and explosive barrels.\n\nWhen most weapons are used, they cause explosions that deform the terrain, creating circular cavities. If a worm is hit with a weapon, they will lose health. A worm who is out of health will die by blowing themselves up and leaving a grave marker. Worms can also die by being thrown off the side of the map or by falling into the water at the map's base.\n\n== Development ==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\nThe game was originally created by Andy Davidson as an entry for a [[Blitz BASIC]] programming competition run by the ''[[Amiga Format]]'' magazine, a cut-down version of the [[programming language]] having been covermounted previously. The game at this stage was called '''''Total Wormage''''' (possibly in reference to ''[[Total Carnage]]'') and it did not win the competition. Davidson sent the game to several publishers with no success. He then took the game to the [[European Computer Trade Show]], where he met with Mark Foreman \u2013 Head Games Buyer at GEM Distribution. Mark suggested to Andy that he should speak to Ocean/Team17 as they would be an ideal partner \u2013 they also had a stand at the show. Team17 made an offer on-the-spot to develop and publish the game.<ref>IGN [ Worms Blast Preview]</ref><ref>GameSpy [ Worms: Open Warfare Developer Diary]</ref>\n\nThe references to the developers' home county, [[Yorkshire]], is visible, with a soundbank named \"Tykes\", which is a Yorkshire accent, and in the \"Hell\" level found in the single player mission mode, a sign with \"Welcome to [[Ossett]]! Ha! ha! ha!\" written on it.\n===Character, level and sound design===\nThe game's graphics and sound design is primarily 'cartoon-like' (though less so than the later games in the series). Levels designs are randomly generated by the use of alpha-numeric strings as their [[Random seed|seeds]]. The object and landscape sets used to generate the field are arranged into 'themes' including forests, martian landscapes, beaches and 'hell'.\n\n== Release ==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\nThe North American release of the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] version was the subject of considerable negotiation, as Sony Computer Entertainment of America had a policy against 2D games being published for the console.<ref name=\"NGenPSw\"/> The [[Sega Saturn]] version of the game was a straight port of the PlayStation version.<ref name=\"SSMukSSw\"/>\n\nAn [[Atari Jaguar]] version was also developed by Team17 and published by [[Telegames]] in May 15, 1998.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Charlton|first=Frank|url=http://www.stformat.com/stf85/pages_nx1500/stf85_010.jpg|title=STF News... - Worms wriggles in|magazine=[[ST Format]]|issue=85|publisher=[[Future plc]]|date=August 1996|page=10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Jason|url=http://www.jaguarsector.com/index.php?autocom=ibwiki&cmd=article&do=print_article&id=379|title=Atari Jaguar Timeline|website=jaguarsector.com|accessdate=2018-09-13|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130629025431/http://www.jaguarsector.com/index.php?autocom=ibwiki&cmd=article&do=print_article&id=379|archivedate=29 June 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Telegames announced the release of this version after becoming the last remaining software publisher for the Jaguar and like other games published following the system's discontinuation,<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File%3AEGM_US_094.pdf&page=24|title=Tidbits...|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=94|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=May 1997|page=24}}</ref> ''Worms'' could be purchased either through [[Direct selling|direct order]] from Telegames' US and UK websites or select retailers such as [[EB Games|Electronics Boutique]].<ref>{{cite magazine|last=|first=|url=https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File:GamePro_US_105.pdf&page=22|title=News Bits|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=105|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=June 1997|page=20}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/Gamefan_Vol_5_Issue_10#page/n41|title=Recent Sightings of an Endangered Species|magazine=[[GameFan]]|volume=5|issue=10|publisher=Shinno Media|date=October 1997|page=36}}</ref> It also served as the final title released for the console to be officially licensed with the Atari name, as the rights to said name and other [[intellectual property]] rights of [[Atari Corporation]] were sold to [[Hasbro Interactive]] before [[JT Storage]]'s bankruptcy in [[1999 in video gaming|1999]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.host.fptoday.com/melek/jaguar/jag-96.htm|title=Hasbro Interactive Acquires Legendary Atari Game Property Assets|website=Nine Lives|date=March 16, 1998|accessdate=2018-12-02|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051107232949/http://www.host.fptoday.com/melek/jaguar/jag-96.htm|archivedate=7 November 2005|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Cancelled ports ===\nIn 1995, Team17 began development on a port of ''Worms'' to [[Nintendo]]'s [[Virtual Boy]] platform.<ref name=\"MMan\u00edav3i8\">{{cite magazine|author=|url=https://archive.org/stream/MicromaniaTerceraEpocaSpanishIssue8#page/n57/mode/1up|title=Reportaje: Extra\u00f1a mezcla... de gusanos - Worms|magazine=[[Microman\u00eda]]|volume=3|issue=8|publisher=HobbyPress|date=September 1995|page=58|lang=es}}</ref> The game was to be published by Ocean, but was canceled only weeks into development as a result of Nintendo's discontinuation of the console.<ref>{{cite web|last=Radke|first=Christian|url=https://www.planetvb.com/modules/games/?u030g|title=Worms|website=planetvb.com|date=2020|access-date=2020-04-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190529195248/https://www.planetvb.com/modules/games/?u030g|archive-date=2019-05-29|url-status=live}}</ref> A [[32X]] release was also planned but never released as well.<ref name=\"MMan\u00edav3i8\"/>\n\n=== Expansion pack ===\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\n''Worms Reinforcements'' ([[1996 in video gaming|1996]]) is an expansion pack for ''Worms'', which was later amalgamated with the original game to create ''Worms and Reinforcements United'' (a.k.a.

Reviewing the Saturn version, ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]'' especially praised Worms's unexpected complexity and the fun of multiplayer mode, and called it \"Quite simply the most playable game to hit the Saturn so far.\"<ref name=\"SSMukSSw\"/>\n\n''Maximum'' commented that \"Basically, ''Worms'' is ''[[Lemmings (video game)|Lemmings]]'', but it's without the puzzles and with weapons instead.\" While firmly stating that they found the game dull and unappealing, they acknowledged that it was clearly well-liked by gamers.<ref name=\"MaximumSSw\"/><ref name=\"MaximumSSw/>\n\nA ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' critic argued while the game resembles ''Lemmings'' on a cursory examination, in actuality it is much more similar to ''[[Cannon Fodder (video game)|Cannon Fodder]]''. Praising the need for both strategy and skill, the multiplayer design, and the randomly generated landscapes, he described ''Worms'' as \"the kind of game that makes no excuses for its lack of texture-mapped polygons or its minimalist gameplay. ''Worms'' is a fun game with an infectious spirit and near endless replay value.\"<ref name=\"NGenPSw\"/><ref name=\"NGenSSw\"/>\n\nCoach Kyle of ''[[GamePro]]'' summarized that \"A humorous concept never really pays off in ''Worms''.\" He criticized that the tiny size of the characters and their weapons makes them unappealing and even hard to make out. While allowing that the use of the different weapons is interesting at first, he found the action too slow-paced and repetitive to maintain interest.<ref name=\"GProSSw\"/>\n\nThe four reviewers of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' commented that \"Some games have great graphics and control, but ''Worms'' doesn't need either because the fun factor is a 10+. With multiplayer ability of up to four people, ''Worms'' is one of those games that is so unique, it doesn't fit into any category - except innovative and incredibly addictive.\"<ref name=\"EGMSSw\"/> They later named it one of their \"Top 5 Most Original Games of 1996\".<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Top 5 Most Original Games of 1996|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=91|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=February 1997|page=152}}</ref>\n\n''[[GameSpot]]'' criticized the slowness of large multiplayer sessions and the imprecision of the keyboard controls, but, like ''Sega Saturn Magazine'', they lauded the combination of surface simplicity and underlying complexity, summarizing that \"Like the board game [[Reversi|Othello]], ''Worms'' takes only a few minutes to learn, but may take a lifetime to master.\"<ref name=\"GSpotPCw\"/>\n\nConversely, the ''[[Amiga Power]]'' review, written in the style of a magazine personality quiz, whilst praising the detail of the animation, described frustrating imbalances especially in relation to the vaunted 16-player multi-player mode and was critical of the puerility of the game's humour.<ref name=\"APA500w\"/>\n\n''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' named ''Worms'' a runner-up for Strategy Game of the Year (behind ''[[Dragon Force]]'').<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The Best of '96|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |issue=92|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=March 1997|page=88}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\n''Worms'' is the first in the [[Worms (series)|''Worms series'']] of games.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{official website|http://worms.team17.com/}} ''Worms'' series\n*{{MobyGames|id=/worms|name=''Worms''}}\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08C-ttHHKFs Total Wormage trailer]\n\n{{Team17}}\n{{Virtual Boy}}\n{{Worms series}}\n{{Portal bar|1990s|United Kingdom|Video games}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Worms (1995 video game)}}\n[[Category:Worms games| 01]]\n[[Category:1995 video games]]\n[[Category:Ocean Software games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Video games with expansion packs]]\n[[Category:Games commercially released with DOSBox]]\n[[Category:Amiga games]]\n[[Category:Artillery video games]]\n[[Category:Atari Jaguar games]]\n[[Category:Cancelled Sega 32X games]]\n[[Category:Cancelled Virtual Boy games]]\n[[Category:CD32 games]]\n[[Category:DOS games]]\n[[Category:Game Boy games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation (console) games]]\n[[Category:Sega Genesis games]]\n[[Category:Sega Saturn games]]\n[[Category:Strategy video games]]\n[[Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System games]]\n[[Category:Team17]]\n[[Category:Telegames games]]\n[[Category:Video games scored by Allister Brimble]]\n", "text_old": "{{About||the 2007 game|Worms (2007 video game)|the 1983 game|Worms?}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{under construction|placedby=KGRAMR|nosection=yes}}\n{{in use}}\n{{Infobox video game\n| title        = Worms\n| image        = Worms-win-cover.jpg\n| image_size   = 256px\n| caption      = \n| developer    = [[Team17]]\n| publisher    = [[Ocean Software]]\n| designer     = [[Andy Davidson (game designer)|Andy Davidson]]\n|composer      = [[Bj\u00f8rn Lynne]]\n| series       = ''[[Worms (series)|Worms]]''\n| engine       = \n| released     = '''Amiga, CD32, Game Boy & Mac'''<br />{{vgrelease|EU|1995<ref>{{MobyGames|id=/worms|name=''Worms''}}</ref><ref>[http://amr.abime.net/review_10209 Worms review from CU Amiga Magazine (Dec 1995) \u2013 Amiga Magazine Rack] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220093731/http://amr.abime.net/review_10209 |date=2012-02-20 }}</ref>}}'''Mega Drive'''<br />{{vgrelease|EU|June 1, 1995}}'''PC (DOS)'''<br />{{Video game release|NA|October 31, 1995 (Retail)|EU|1995|NA|October 19, 2011 (Steam)}}'''PlayStation'''<br />{{Video game release|NA|1996|EU|November, 1995<ref name=\"CTW565\">{{cite magazine |title=Christmas Games Guide |magazine=Computer Trade Weekly |location=United Kingdom |date=27 November 1995 |issue=565 |page=43 }}</ref>|JP|February 28, 1997}}'''SNES'''<br />{{vgrelease|EU|September 29, 1996}}'''Saturn'''<br />{{Video game release|NA|1996|EU|1995|JP|March 14, 1997}}'''Jaguar'''<br />{{vgrelease|NA|May 15, 1998}}\n| genre        = [[Artillery game|Artillery]], [[Strategy video game|Strategy]]\n| modes        = [[Single-player]], [[multiplayer]]\n| platforms    = [[Amiga]], [[Amiga CD32]], [[Game Boy]], [[Sega Genesis]], [[Atari Jaguar]], [[Mac OS]], [[IBM PC compatible]] ([[MS-DOS]]), [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], [[Sega Saturn]], [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]]\n}}\n'''''Worms''''' is a 2D [[Artillery game|artillery]] [[Strategy video game|tactical]] video game developed by [[Team17]] and released in [[1995 in video gaming|1995]]. It is the first game in the [[Worms (series)|''Worms series'']] of video games.\n\n''Worms'' is a [[turn based]] game where a player controls a team of worms against other teams of worms that are controlled by a computer or human opponent. The aim is to use various weapons to kill the worms on the other teams and have the last surviving worm(s).\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:Worms scrapyardscreenshot.png|thumb|left|From the [[Amiga]] version: A [[scrapyard]] themed level, with the player using the [[blowtorch]] tool.]]\n''Worms'' is a turn based [[artillery game]], similar to other early games in the genre such as ''[[Scorched Earth (video game)|Scorched Earth]].\nEach player controls a team of several worms. During the course of the game, players take turns selecting one of their worms. They then use whatever tools and weapons are available to attack and kill the opponents' worms, thereby winning the game. Worms may move around the terrain in a variety of ways, normally by walking and jumping but also by using particular tools such as the \"Bungee\" and \"Ninja Rope\", to move to otherwise inaccessible areas. Each turn is time-limited to ensure that players do not hold up the game with excessive thinking or moving. The time limit can be modified in some of the games in the Worms series.\n\nOver fifty weapons and tools may be available each time a game is played, and differing selections of weapons and tools can be saved into a \"scheme\" for easy selection in future games. Other scheme settings allow options such as deployment of reinforcement crates, from which additional weapons can be obtained, and sudden death where the game is rushed to a conclusion after a time limit expires. Some settings provide for the inclusion of objects such as land mines and explosive barrels.\n\nWhen most weapons are used, they cause explosions that deform the terrain, creating circular cavities. If a worm is hit with a weapon, they will lose health. A worm who is out of health will die by blowing themselves up and leaving a grave marker. Worms can also die by being thrown off the side of the map or by falling into the water at the map's base.\n\n== Development ==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\nThe game was originally created by Andy Davidson as an entry for a [[Blitz BASIC]] programming competition run by the ''[[Amiga Format]]'' magazine, a cut-down version of the [[programming language]] having been covermounted previously. The game at this stage was called '''''Total Wormage''''' (possibly in reference to ''[[Total Carnage]]'') and it did not win the competition. Davidson sent the game to several publishers with no success. He then took the game to the [[European Computer Trade Show]], where he met with Mark Foreman \u2013 Head Games Buyer at GEM Distribution. Mark suggested to Andy that he should speak to Ocean/Team17 as they would be an ideal partner \u2013 they also had a stand at the show. Team17 made an offer on-the-spot to develop and publish the game.<ref>IGN [ Worms Blast Preview]</ref><ref>GameSpy [ Worms: Open Warfare Developer Diary]</ref>\n\nThe references to the developers' home county, [[Yorkshire]], is visible, with a soundbank named \"Tykes\", which is a Yorkshire accent, and in the \"Hell\" level found in the single player mission mode, a sign with \"Welcome to [[Ossett]]! Ha! ha! ha!\" written on it.\n===Character, level and sound design===\nThe game's graphics and sound design is primarily 'cartoon-like' (though less so than the later games in the series). Levels designs are randomly generated by the use of alpha-numeric strings as their [[Random seed|seeds]]. The object and landscape sets used to generate the field are arranged into 'themes' including forests, martian landscapes, beaches and 'hell'.\n\n== Release ==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\nThe North American release of the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] version was the subject of considerable negotiation, as Sony Computer Entertainment of America had a policy against 2D games being published for the console.<ref name=\"NGenPSw\"/> The [[Sega Saturn]] version of the game was a straight port of the PlayStation version.<ref name=\"SSMukSSw\"/>\n\nAn [[Atari Jaguar]] version was also developed by Team17 and published by [[Telegames]] in May 15, 1998.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Charlton|first=Frank|url=http://www.stformat.com/stf85/pages_nx1500/stf85_010.jpg|title=STF News... - Worms wriggles in|magazine=[[ST Format]]|issue=85|publisher=[[Future plc]]|date=August 1996|page=10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Jason|url=http://www.jaguarsector.com/index.php?autocom=ibwiki&cmd=article&do=print_article&id=379|title=Atari Jaguar Timeline|website=jaguarsector.com|accessdate=2018-09-13|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130629025431/http://www.jaguarsector.com/index.php?autocom=ibwiki&cmd=article&do=print_article&id=379|archivedate=29 June 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Telegames announced the release of this version after becoming the last remaining software publisher for the Jaguar and like other games published following the system's discontinuation,<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File%3AEGM_US_094.pdf&page=24|title=Tidbits...|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=94|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=May 1997|page=24}}</ref> ''Worms'' could be purchased either through [[Direct selling|direct order]] from Telegames' US and UK websites or select retailers such as [[EB Games|Electronics Boutique]].<ref>{{cite magazine|last=|first=|url=https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File:GamePro_US_105.pdf&page=22|title=News Bits|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=105|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=June 1997|page=20}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/Gamefan_Vol_5_Issue_10#page/n41|title=Recent Sightings of an Endangered Species|magazine=[[GameFan]]|volume=5|issue=10|publisher=Shinno Media|date=October 1997|page=36}}</ref> It also served as the final title released for the console to be officially licensed with the Atari name, as the rights to said name and other [[intellectual property]] rights of [[Atari Corporation]] were sold to [[Hasbro Interactive]] before [[JT Storage]]'s bankruptcy in [[1999 in video gaming|1999]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.host.fptoday.com/melek/jaguar/jag-96.htm|title=Hasbro Interactive Acquires Legendary Atari Game Property Assets|website=Nine Lives|date=March 16, 1998|accessdate=2018-12-02|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051107232949/http://www.host.fptoday.com/melek/jaguar/jag-96.htm|archivedate=7 November 2005|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Cancelled ports ===\nIn 1995, Team17 began development on a port of ''Worms'' to [[Nintendo]]'s [[Virtual Boy]] platform.<ref name=\"MMan\u00edav3i8\">{{cite magazine|author=|url=https://archive.org/stream/MicromaniaTerceraEpocaSpanishIssue8#page/n57/mode/1up|title=Reportaje: Extra\u00f1a mezcla... de gusanos - Worms|magazine=[[Microman\u00eda]]|volume=3|issue=8|publisher=HobbyPress|date=September 1995|page=58|lang=es}}</ref> The game was to be published by Ocean, but was canceled only weeks into development as a result of Nintendo's discontinuation of the console.<ref>{{cite web|last=Radke|first=Christian|url=https://www.planetvb.com/modules/games/?u030g|title=Worms|website=planetvb.com|date=2020|access-date=2020-04-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190529195248/https://www.planetvb.com/modules/games/?u030g|archive-date=2019-05-29|url-status=live}}</ref> A [[32X]] release was also planned but never released as well.<ref name=\"MMan\u00edav3i8\"/>\n\n=== Expansion pack ===\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\n''Worms Reinforcements'' ([[1996 in video gaming|1996]]) is an expansion pack for ''Worms'', which was later amalgamated with the original game to create ''Worms and Reinforcements United'' (a.k.a.

It is largely built upon the original Amiga game engine with various gameplay enhancement and additions, as well as graphical improvements and fixes. During the development of ''Worms 2'', Andy Davidson wrote this special edition produced exclusively for the AGA chipset Amiga. Only 5000 copies were ever sold. It was also the last version released for the Commodore Amiga platform from which the game originated.\n\n=== Remake ===\n{{seealso|Worms (2007 video game)}}\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\nA [[Video game remake|remake]], also called ''[[Worms (2007 video game)|Worms]]'', for the Xbox 360 was released in 2007.

By March 1996, its sales had reached almost 250,000 copies, following its release in November 1995.<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|url=http://www.nuke.com/cgr/news/9603/worms.htm|title=Sales of Worms skyrockets|work=[[Computer Game Review]]|publisher=[[Ziff-Davis]]|date=1996|access-date=2020-04-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19961018190644/http://www.nuke.com:80/cgr/news/9603/worms.htm|archive-date=1996-10-18|url-status=live}}</ref> Across all its ports, the game ultimately sold above 5 million units by 2006.<ref name=\"RG23\">{{cite magazine|last=Day|first=Ashley|title=The Making of... Worms|magazine=[[Retro Gamer]]|issue=23|publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]]|date=March 2006|pages=26\u201329}}</ref>\n\n''Worms'' sharply divided critics. Reviewing the Saturn version, ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]'' especially praised Worms's unexpected complexity and the fun of multiplayer mode, and called it \"Quite simply the most playable game to hit the Saturn so far.\"<ref name=\"SSMukSSw\"/>\n\n''Maximum'' commented that \"Basically, ''Worms'' is ''[[Lemmings (video game)|Lemmings]]'', but it's without the puzzles and with weapons instead.\" While firmly stating that they found the game dull and unappealing, they acknowledged that it was clearly well-liked by gamers.<ref name=\"MaximumSSw\"/><ref name=\"MaximumSSw/>\n\nA ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' critic argued while the game resembles ''Lemmings'' on a cursory examination, in actuality it is much more similar to ''[[Cannon Fodder (video game)|Cannon Fodder]]''. Praising the need for both strategy and skill, the multiplayer design, and the randomly generated landscapes, he described ''Worms'' as \"the kind of game that makes no excuses for its lack of texture-mapped polygons or its minimalist gameplay.

This design is also sometimes referred to as '''1923 Tube Stock''' or '''Pre 1938 Stock'''. Most of the Standard Stock was built to replace the first generation of [[London Underground Gate Stock|\"Gate Stock\"]] Tube trains or to provide additional trains for extensions built in the 1920s and early 1930s.\nStandard Stock cars consisted of motor cars (with a driver's cab, behind which was a \"switch compartment\" occupying approximately one-third of the length of the car), plus trailer cars and \"control trailers\" (with a driving cab but no motor). All were equipped with air operated sliding doors, although the guard's door on the earlier trains was a manually operated inward-opening hinged door.\n\n==1922 Stock prototype cars==\n\nFor evaluation purposes, in anticipation of the large number of cars that were to be built over the next several years, six experimental cars were ordered and had been delivered by February 1923. There were five trailers and one control trailer, which were marshalled between French-built [[London Underground Gate Stock|\"Gate Stock\"]] driving motor cars. A demonstration for the press took place on the Piccadilly line on 3 February 1923, after which the new cars and the French motor cars were moved by road to the Hampstead Line, entering service in August.{{sfn |Bruce |1988 |p=53}} The French motor cars were part of a batch of 20 which had been rebuilt with air-operated doors, to allow them to work with the [[London Underground 1920 Stock|1920 Stock]], the first batch of vehicles built with air doors.{{sfn |Bruce |1988 |p=49}} The trailers and French motor cars formed the inaugural train on the Hampstead Line extension from Golders Green to Hendon when it opened on 19 November 1923.{{sfn |Bruce |1968 |pp=44\u201345}}\n\nThe builders were given a partial specification, which ensured that each car would have 48 seats and two sets of air-operated double doors on each side, providing an opening which was {{convert|4.5|ft|m|3}} wide. Beyond these basic guidelines, each builder was allowed to build a trailer car to its own design, although externally, they looked very similar. The control trailer was designed by the [[Underground Electric Railways Company of London|Underground Electric Railways]].{{sfn |Bruce |1988 |p=53}}\nThe stock became known as the 1922 Stock or Competition Stock and was considered part of the Standard stock fleet.{{sfn |Hardy |2001 |p=54}}\n\n== Production stock ==\n[[File:London Underground tube coach (CJ Allen, Steel Highway, 1928).jpg|Interior|thumb]]\n[[File:London Underground Standard Stock - Flickr - James E. Petts (1).jpg|Switch compartment|thumb]]\nThe earliest Standard Stock was built for use on the [[Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway|Hampstead tube]], which was extended from [[Golders Green tube station|Golders Green]] to [[Edgware tube station|Edgware]] and from Clapham Common to [[Morden tube station|Morden]] in 1923, as well as incorporating the [[City and South London Railway]], which had been rebuilt with larger tunnels. 191 cars were ordered from three manufacturers in 1923, which were formed into five-car trains.{{sfn|Bruce |1988 |pp=53\u201354}} The City and South London Railway had been built with tunnels which were only {{convert|10.5|ft|m}} in diameter, and had used [[London Underground electric locomotives|small electric locomotives]] to haul trailer cars until it closed for rebuilding in 1923. The reconstruction was completed in 1925,{{sfn |Bruce |1988 |pp=7, 16}} and 69 of the new vehicles were owned by them, while the rest were owned by the London Electric Railway Company.{{sfn|Bruce |1988 |pp=53\u201354}}\n\nIn a departure from previous practice, where all traction control equipment had been supplied by [[British Thomson-Houston]] (BTH), most of the batch were fitted with equipment by Metropolitan-Vickers, which consisted of electro-magnetic contactors arranged to manage the acceleration of the train automatically, with switching from series to parallel connection of the motors handled by bridging them rather than open-circuiting them. Two motor cars had equipment by [[General Electric Company plc|General Electric Co]] (GEC), which worked similarly, and was required to work in multiple with the Metropolitan-Vickers equipment. All the vehicles used a C-type door operating engine, which proved to be a poor design. Another 127 cars were ordered in 1924, with most of the motor cars and some of the control trailers using GEC equipment. Cars with GEC controls used WT54 motors, which those with Metropolitan-Vickers equipment used MV152 motors, and although they were interchangeable in theory, in practice they were always kept in pairs. The 1924 cars were fitted with a D-type door engine, which was reclassified as a DL-type after a minor modification had to be made, but proved much more resilient than the earlier C-type, and was used on all Standard Stock until 1931.{{sfn |Bruce |1988 |pp=54\u201356}}\n\nDelivery of the cars was not easy, as the Hampstead Line did not have a mainline railway connection to any other line. Consequently, the bodies and bogies were delivered by road, and two large gantries were erected at both Morden and Golders Green depots. A traction engine would arrive at the site with the body, and would position it below the gantries. It would then be raised so that the road wheels could be removed, and a steam crane would position the bogies onto the track. Once the body and bogies were united, a steam engine would remove the complete car, to allow the next one to be assembled.{{sfn|Bruce |1968 |pp=42\u201343}}\n\nA further 120 cars were ordered in 1925, with both types of equipment, to cope with the opening of the junction at Kennington and the lengthening of trains to six cars and from 1926, seven cars. Motor cars seated 30 passengers, while trailers had 48 seats. Control trailers had a cab at one end, but no switch compartment, and so seated 44. Trains initially had a crew of three, consisting of a motorman, a front conductor, and a rear guard. The guard signalled the conductor that the train was ready to go, and the conductor signalled the motorman. Once the use of air-operated doors had proved to be successful, modifications were made to enable a train to be operated by a crew of two. Changes included the fitting of a telephone, so that the guard and motorman could communicate, interlocks to ensure that all doors were closed, and the re-routing of the starting bell, so that it could be operated by a guard at the rear of the train, rather than the conductor at the front. These changes were completed by 1927, allowing the reduction of the train crew.{{sfn |Bruce |1988 |pp=55\u201357}}\n\n=== 1926 and 1927 builds ===\nThe superior nature of the new trains helped to show up the inadequacies of plans to convert large numbers of gate stock cars to have air doors, and they were largely abandoned. Another 112 cars, all fitted with GEC equipment, were ordered from Metropolitan Carriage Wagon and Finance in 1926, and an order for 170 cars followed on in 1927. This enabled trains to be increased to seven cars, and more trains to be operated. A second order was placed with MCWF in 1927, for 136 more cars, but the traction control equipment was supplied by British Thomson-Houston. Their equipment generally proved to be more reliable, and previous batches of Standard Stock were modified so that the main contactors could be replaced with BTH equipment. BTH continued to be the preferred supplier for this equipment for the next 35 years. Metropolitan-Vickers supplied their own motors, but Standard Stock built by other manufacturers used GEC motors. The inter-operability of cars from several manufacturers with three types of traction control was the reason that they were called Standard Stock.{{sfn |Bruce |1988 |p=59}}\n\nThe 1927 builds used a 'Z' bogie, instead of the previous 'Y' bogie, which had wheels of {{convert|36|in|cm}} diameter, as opposed to {{convert|40|in|cm}}. This required a modification to the WT54 motors, supplied by GEC, which were then known as WT54A motors, and the gearing was altered so that cars with either size of wheels remained compatible. Trials with the 'loudaphone' system by which the guard and motorman could communicate on this stock resulted in it being retro-fitted to the earlier stock.{{sfn |Bruce |1988 |pp=59\u201361}}\n\nDuring this period, many of the Gate Stock cars on the Central line had been converted to air-door operation by the Union Construction Co., which was based at Feltham. Plans were briefly formulated to convert the Gate Stock on the Piccadilly and Bakerloo lines, but analysis showed that the cost of building a new car was only slightly more than the cost of converting an old one, and so an order for 182 new cars was placed. They were known as the 1927 Feltham Stock, although the door plates carried the date 1928, and they were not delivered until 1929 and 1930. The lightweight construction caused problems in later years, when the seat risers and body bolsters developed fractures. With the batch of cars built by MCWF and fitted with BTH equipment, these vehicles enabled Gate Stock to be withdrawn from the Piccadilly line in June 1929, and from the Bakerloo line on 1 January 1930.{{sfn |Bruce |1988 |p=62}}\n\n=== 1929 and 1930 builds ===\nAnother 53 cars were ordered from the Union Construction Co. in 1929, to enable the remaining 1920 Stock cars, which had air doors but were not really suitable for operation on the open sections of the Piccadilly line, to be transferred to the Bakerloo line. An extra train of two motor cars and four trailers was ordered in 1930, to test several new features. They were the last cars to be built by the Union Construction Co., for it was closed as a result of political pressure in 1932. The new motor cars were {{convert|1|ft|m|2}} longer, and the trailers were {{convert|2|ft|m}} longer. This was achieved by tapering one or both ends, to prevent them fouling the [[structure gauge]] on curves. On two of the trailers, the centre door openings were widened from {{convert|4|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}} to {{convert|5|ft|2|in|m|abbr=on}}. On the other two, the width of the centre doors was not altered, but the seating capacity was reduced from 48 to 40, to allow the provision of an additional single-leaf door at both ends of the car. The position of the guard's door control panel was altered, although this was not found to be satisfactory, and was dropped from subsequent builds.{{sfn |Bruce |1988 |pp=63\u201364}}\n\nBecause of the Piccadilly extensions, which were above ground, heaters were fitted, and the use of British materials in its construction was used for publicity purposes, at a time when there was an industrial depression. It became known as the 'All British' train, and operated on the Piccadilly and Northern lines. Transfer between the two was aided by the construction of a junction at Kings Cross in 1927. The Northern line offered heavier traffic, with which to assess the effectiveness of the new features. 62 production cars were ordered from Metropolitan-Cammell, which was formed from the Metropolitan Carriage Wagon and Finance Co. and Cammell Laird at this time, for delivery to the Bakerloo line. They replaced the Watford Joint Stock, which although relatively new, needed a larger crew and had to stop for longer at stations, because of its swing doors. Problems with the swing doors were highlighted by a fatal accident in which a passenger got caught in them, but the door interlock did not detect it.{{sfn |Bruce |1988 |pp=64\u201365}}\n\nThis build was not initially compatible with other builds, because it was fitted with an electro-pneumatic braking system, as well as the Westinghouse air brake. To accommodate its control, an extra 10-core control jumper was fitted, and previous builds of Standard Stock were gradually altered to include the extra wires, a process which was largely completed by 1936. Standard Stock motor cars which were running on the Bakerloo line with Cammell Laird 1920 Stock trailers were not fitted with the electro-pneumatic brake wiring until the trailers were withdrawn in 1938.{{sfn |Bruce |1988 |pp=65\u201366}}\n\n=== 1931 and 1934 builds ===\nIn 1929, government aid enabled plans for extensions to the Piccadilly line northwards to Cockfosters and westwards from [[Hammersmith tube station (District and Piccadilly lines)|Hammersmith]] to Acton Town, on tracks which were parallel to the District line but not shared with it, to come to fruition. The length of the line increased from {{convert|8.5|mi|km}} to {{convert|40|mi|km}}, and so more trains were needed. The improvements made for the 1930 build were incorporated into the design, as well as some new features. 145 motor cars were ordered from Metropolitan-Cammell, and 130 trailer cars were shared between two builders. All trailer cars had 12 doors, with two sets of double doors and a single-leaf door at both ends on each side. Electro-pneumatic brakes were fitted, as was a weak-field control, which enabled higher speed running and had been tested on the 1930 build. Its use on the Northern line had demonstrated that the same service intervals could be maintained with four fewer trains.{{sfn |Bruce |1988 |pp=67\u201369}}\n\nThe final build of Standard Stock was a small batch of 26 motor cars ordered from Metropolitan-Cammell in 1934, after the formation of the London Passenger Transport Board in the previous year. The Piccadilly line was extended from South Harrow to Uxbridge, and this required an extra eight seven-car trains. These were made up from the new motor cars and some reshuffling of stock between other lines. Although very similar to the 1931 build, there were some minor differences. The 1931 build had used motors with roller bearings for the first time, and ten of the new motor cars were also fitted with roller bearing axle boxes, to reduce the amount of maintenance required with white metal bearings.{{sfn |Bruce |1988 |p=69}} With the completion of the 1934 build, the total number of Standard Stock cars was 645 motor cars, 551 trailers and 270 control trailers.{{sfn |Bruce |1988 |p=127}}\n\n== Allocation ==\nBy the time the final cars had been delivered, the standard stock was operating on the Northern, Piccadilly and Bakerloo lines. There were 724 cars on the Northern line, consisting of 336 motor cars, 243 trailers and 145 control trailers. This group comprised all of the cars made in 1923, 1924, 1925 and 1926, supplemented by 62 per cent of the 1927 build by Metropolitan, and 13 of the 1927-built Feltham cars. The Piccadilly line had 509 cars, comprising some of the 1927 Metropolitan and Feltham batches, most of the 1929 Feltham stock, the experimental 1930 Feltham train, and all of the 1931 and 1934 stock. The Bakerloo line also had some of the 1927 Metropolitan and Feltham batches, four cars from the 1929 Feltham build and the 1930 Metropolitan stock. This was a total of 198 cars, made up of 82 motor cars, 62 trailers and 54 control trailers. To make up the number of trains, an additional 20 trailers and 20 control trailers were needed, and these were cars of 1920 Cammell Laird air-door stock.{{sfn |Bruce |1988 |p=127}}\n\nBetween 1935 and 1940, the London Underground benefited from a New Works Programme worth \u00a340 million. This included extensions to the Northern line and the Central line, with delivery of new trains of [[London Underground 1938 Stock|1938 Stock]] beginning in May 1938. The intention was to run the new trains on the Northern line, and transfer the displaced Standard Stock to the Central line, which was using stock built in 1900\u20131903. In addition, some of the displaced stock would be used on the Moorgate-Finsbury Park \"Highbury Branch\", also known as the [[Northern City Line]], and some would be used to increase the length of trains on the Bakerloo line to seven cars. 82 control trailers were converted to trailers, and 21 driving motor cars were altered from \"A\" cars to \"D\" cars, as the makeup of 7 car trains on the Bakerloo and Central lines had the three-car unit at the opposite end to those on the Northern line.{{sfn |Hardy |1986 |pp=70-71}}\n\nThe Northern City Line had previously been served by surface stock, and had to be modified to accommodate the Standard Stock. Additionally, it had a non-standard arrangement of the third and fourth rails which supplied power to the cars, and these were modified to the same configuration as on the Northern line during the refurbishment.{{sfn |Hardy |1986 |p=71}} The use of control trailers at one end of a short train was virtually discontinued during the 1930s, because of the risks of disruption to services. A 3-car train consisted on a driving motor car, a trailer and a control trailer (DM-T-CT) and only had one compressor on the motor car. If it failed, the train was stranded, causing delays, whereas a 4-car short train had two motor cars (DM-T-T-DM) and hence two compressors. Failure of one did not prevent the train continuing.{{sfn|Hardy|2001|p=31}} The exception to the use of control trailers was the off-peak trains on the Northern City Line, which consisted of a driving motor car and a control trailer, and these 2-car trains continued to run until October 1964.{{sfn |Hardy |1981 |p=17}}\n\n===Central line===\nOn the [[Central line (London Underground)|Central line]], Standard Stock began replacing the [[London Underground 1900/1903 Stock|1900/1903 Stock]] in the autumn of 1938, and this action was completed by mid-1939. The Central line used a three-rail system, with a central conductor rail supplying the power, and was not converted to a four-rail system until May 1940. All of the trains were therefore converted to work with the three-rail system as an interim measure, and then converted back to four-rail operation once the track had been modified.{{sfn |Hardy |1986 |p=71}}\n\nAt the time, extensions to [[West Ruislip tube station|West Ruislip]], [[Epping tube station|Epping]] and [[Hainault tube station|Hainault]] were under construction, which would require more trains, but the onset of the [[Second World War]] resulted in the extensions being postponed. Nearly 200 cars were stored in the partially built Hainault depot, but that was then requisitioned by the U.S. Army Transportation Corps, and the cars were moved to open sidings. Others were stored on sidings at Edgware, Golders Green, Highgate, Morden, Neasden, and Stanmore, as well as in depots where there was spare capacity. Some of the motor cars were painted grey, and used for engineering duties. Some trains were used for \"Tube Refreshment Specials\", supplying food and drink to people sheltering from air raids on the underground platforms.{{sfn |Hardy |2001 |p=33}}\n\nAfter the war ended, the Central line extensions opened, reaching Stratford on 4 December 1946, Newbury Park and Woodford on 14 December 1947, West Ruislip, Loughton and Hainault on 21 November 1948, and Epping on 25 September 1949.{{sfn |Bruce |1968 |pp=75-76}} The effects of six or more years of open-air storage on the Standard Stock was severe, and a programme of heavy refurbishment began, which included replacement of warped window frames, renewal of corroded equipment as necessary, and in many cases, complete rewiring. Stations had been lengthened to accommodate 8-car trains before the war, but trains were restricted to 6 cars until the depot at White City could be altered. Some 7-car trains began operating from November 1947, and 8-car trains from the following January. However, the reliability of the refurbished cars was poor, and a full service of 8-car trains was not achieved{{sfn |Hardy |2001 |pp=36-37}} until additional cars became available from other lines, following the delivery of the [[London Underground 1959 Stock|1959 Stock]]. The achievement was short-lived, as all Standard Stock had been withdrawn from the Central line less than three years later.{{sfn |Bruce |1968 |pp=76-77}}\n\n8-car trains were formed of two 4-car units, each consisting of two driving motor cars and two trailers (DM-T-T-DM). This arrangement was not ideal at busy times, since there was a section in the middle of the train where there were no passenger doors for almost {{convert|50|ft|m}}, caused by the switch compartments behind the driving cabs. In order to alleviate the problem, one of the four-car units was split, and two cars were placed at either end of the other unit. The formation from 1961 thus became DM-T x DM-T-T-DM x T-DM, which reduced loading times at peak periods.{{sfn |Bruce |1988 |p=72}}\n\n== Disposal ==\n1938 Stock replaced the Standard Stock on the Bakerloo line, the changeover being completed on 23 May 1949,{{sfn |Bruce |1988 |p=72}} although a batch of 1927-built trailers (usually referred to as \"58 trailers\" because of the number of cars in the group rather than a year reference, as was normally the case with Tube stock classes) were converted to operate with the new stock on the Bakerloo line.{{sfn |Hardy |1976 |p=76}} The Standard Stock on the Piccadilly line was eventually replaced by the [[London Underground 1959 Stock|1959 Stock]]. This enabled the first large-scale withdrawals and scrapping of Standard Stock, although some of the better cars were transferred to the Central line to complete the 8-car trains.{{sfn |Bruce |1968 |p=76}}\n\nLondon Transport intended to use the prototype [[London Underground 1960 Stock|1960 Stock]] to develop new trains to replace the Standard Stock on the Central line: however, the condition of the 30\u201340 year-old Central line fleet were deteriorating under an intense service pattern, exacerbated by growing demand from the expansion of electric trains in the [[Eastern Region of British Railways]].{{sfn |Hardy |1981 |p=25}} The situation escalated with a [[List of London Underground accidents#Holland Park and Redbridge fires|fatal electrical fire]] on car 3465 near Holland Park in 1958, and another (non-fatal) fire on car 3673 near Redbridge in 1960.{{sfn |Bruce |1988 |p=72}}\n\nIn response to the fires, London Transport diverted 57 of the 76 trains from the [[London Underground 1959 Stock|1959 Stock]] to debut on the Central line instead of the Piccadilly line, and ordered another 57 non-driving motor cars that would later form part of the near-identical [[London Underground 1962 Stock|1962 Stock]].{{sfn |Bruce |1968 |p=87}} London Transport also retained some Standard Stock cars from the Piccadilly line to replace the worst performing cars on the Central line.<ref name=\"Connor\">{{cite journal|last=Connor|first=Piers|title=The London Electric Train|journal=Underground News|date=January 2017|issue=668|page=540|publisher=London Underground Railway Society|issn=0306-8617}}</ref>\n\nLondon Transport withdrew the last Standard Stock trains from the Central line in June 1963. The arrival of the 1962 stock in the previous year then allowed the 1959 stock to complete the withdrawal of the Standard Stock from the Piccadilly line by July 1964, which in turn allowed the 1938 Stock to replace the last Standard Stock trains from the Northern City Line, on 3 November 1966.{{sfn|Hardy|1981|p=25}}<ref name=\"Connor\"/>\n\nA number of motor cars saw further service as [[London Underground departmental stock|departmental vehicles]]. 16 were used as ballast motor cars, with many of them lasting until 1978, and four were used as pilot motor cars.{{sfn |Bruce |1987 |pp=91-92}} Motor car 3327 was displayed in the Science Museum, London, for many years, but returned to the London Transport Museum in 1996.{{sfn |Hardy |2002 |p=60}}\n\n== Isle of Wight ==\n[[File:Ryde Pier Head Martin Addison.jpg|thumb|1927 Stock train arriving at [[Ryde Pier Head station.]]]]\nPrior to 1950, there were {{convert|55.5|mi|km}} of steam-operated railways on the [[Isle of Wight]]. This was reduced to {{convert|25.5|mi|km}} between 1952 and 1956, and to just {{convert|8.5|mi|km}} in 1966. The Ryde Pier Head\u2013Shanklin section (the [[Island Line, Isle of Wight|Island Line]]) was retained and electrified,{{sfn |Hardy |2003 |p=9}} but because of the restricted loading gauge at Ryde Tunnels, smaller-than-normal trains were required.{{sfn |Hardy |2003 |p=4}}\n\nThe [[Southern Region of British Railways|Southern Region]] approached London Transport in 1961, to begin negotiations for some of the Standard Stock then being withdrawn. The initial plan was to fit diesel engines into the motor cars, and to use either electric or mechanical transmission.{{sfn |Hardy |2003 |pp=10\u201311}} The first twelve cars were transferred from [[Ruislip]] Depot to [[Wimbledon station|Wimbledon]] in August 1964, from where they were moved to [[Micheldever]] sidings. Further cars followed in June 1965.{{sfn |Hardy |2003 |pp=12\u201313}} In October, a plan to electrify the line was announced, and the idea of fitting diesel engines was dropped. In 1966, the Southern Region had 44 cars at Micheldever, and London Transport had 29 more which were set aside for the scheme. 10 of the Micheldever cars were scrapped, and 12 more were obtained from London Transport.{{sfn |Hardy |2003 |pp=14\u201315}}\n\nOverhaul of the electrical and braking systems was done at Acton Works, which involved transferring the cars from Micheldever back to London Transport. This included conversion to work with a [[Third rail|three-rail]] system, rather than the standard London Transport [[Railway electrification system#Fourth rail|four-rail]] system. The number of cars to be shipped to the Isle of Wight was reduced from 46 to 43 because of the cost of this work. After overhaul, the cars were transferred to [[Stewarts Lane]], where they were repainted in British Rail blue, and were then taken to the Isle of Wight.{{sfn |Hardy |2003 |pp=16\u201317}} They were loaded onto a road vehicle at [[Fratton railway station|Fratton]] belonging to the haulage company [[Pickfords]], and crossed to the island on the [[Wightlink|Portsmouth to Fishbourne ferry]]. Care was needed to ensure that the weather and tides were suitable, and motor cars had to be transferred on special sailings, rather than regular crossings, because of the difficulty of unloading a vehicle of this weight without damaging the ship's unloading ramp.{{sfn |Hardy |2003 |p=18}}\n\nThe cars were formed into 4-car and 3-car units, initially designated as 4-VEC and 3-TIS units.{{sfn |Hardy |2003 |p=18}} Subsequently, they became Classes 452 and 451, and were later reclassified to become [[British Rail Classes 485 and 486|Classes 485 and 486]]. Apart from those cut up following accidents at [[Ryde depot]], and other early withdrawals, most of these units were withdrawn between 1988 and 1991,{{sfn |Hardy |2003 |p=90}} when they were replaced by [[London Underground 1938 Stock]]. In October 1990, five cars were returned to London Transport, to form a Heritage Train.

This was a government initiative in the aftermath of the [[First World War]] to fund schemes which would create employment, particularly in the construction, steel and manufacturing industries. The Underground benefited from \u00a35 million of investment from this source, which in addition to funding extensions to the Northern line, financed the construction of over 1,100 Standard Stock cars between 1922 and 1930.{{sfn |Halliday |2013 |pp=101-105}}\n{|\n|\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Builder\n!Motors\n!Trailers\n!Control<br>Trailers\n!Notes\n|-\n|rowspan=8; align=center |1923\n|align=center|BRCW\n|align=center|\u2014\n|align=center|1\n|align=center|\u2014\n|rowspan=5|Experimental<br>stock\n|-\n|align=center|CLCo\n|align=center|\u2014\n|align=center|1\n|align=center|\u2014\n|-\n|align=center|GRCW\n|align=center|\u2014\n|align=center|1\n|align=center|1\n|-\n|align=center|Leeds\n|align=center|\u2014\n|align=center|1\n|align=center|\u2014\n|-\n|align=center|MCWF\n|align=center|\u2014\n|align=center|1\n|align=center|\u2014\n|-\n|align=center|BRCW\n|align=center|\u2014\n|align=center|35\n|align=center|-\n|rowspan=18|Production<br />stock\n|-\n|align=center|CLCo\n|align=center|41\n|align=center|40\n|align=center|\u2014\n|-\n|align=center|MCWF\n|align=center|40\n|align=center|\u2014\n|align=center|35\n|-\n|rowspan=3; align=center |1924\n|align=center|BRCW\n|align=center|\u2014\n|align=center|50\n|align=center|\u2014\n|-\n|align=center|CLCo\n|align=center|\u2014\n|align=center|\u2014\n|align=center|25\n|-\n|align=center|MCWF\n|align=center|52\n|align=center|\u2014\n|align=center|\u2014\n|-\n|rowspan=2; align=center |1925\n|align=center|CLCo\n|align=center|48\n|align=center|\u2014\n|align=center|\u2014\n|-\n|align=center|MCWF\n|align=center|\u2014\n|align=center|5\n|align=center|67\n|-\n|align=center |1926\n|align=center|MCWF\n|align=center|64\n|align=center|48\n|align=center|\u2014\n|-\n|rowspan=2; align=center |1927\n|align=center|MCWF\n|align=center|110\n|align=center|160\n|align=center|36\n|-\n|align=center|UCC\n|align=center|77\n|align=center|37\n|align=center|68\n|-\n|align=center |1929\n|align=center|UCC\n|align=center|18\n|align=center|17\n|align=center|18\n|-\n|rowspan=2; align=center|1930\n|align=center|MCCW\n|align=center|22\n|align=center|20\n|align=center|20\n|-\n|align=center|UCC\n|align=center|2\n|align=center|4\n|align=center|\u2014\n|-\n|rowspan=3; align=center|1931\n|align=center|BRCW\n|align=center|\u2014\n|align=center|90\n|align=center|\u2014\n|-\n|align=center|GRCW\n|align=center|\u2014\n|align=center|40\n|align=center|\u2014\n|-\n|align=center|MCCW\n|align=center|145\n|align=center|\u2014\n|align=center|\u2014\n|-\n|align=center|1934\n|align=center|MCCW\n|align=center|26\n|align=center|\u2014\n|align=center|\u2014\n|-\n!Totals\n|align=center|1,466\n|align=center|645\n|align=center|551\n|align=center|270\n| &nbsp;\n|}\n|valign=\"top\"|\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=2|Key to Builders\n|-\n|BRCW\n|[[Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company|Birmingham Railway Carriage & Wagon Co.]]\n|-\n|CLCo\n|[[Cammell Laird|Cammell Laird & Co.

Tube stock built between 1923 and 1934, all of which shared the same basic characteristics, but with some detailed differences. This design is also sometimes referred to as '''1923 Tube Stock''' or '''Pre 1938 Stock'''. Most of the Standard Stock was built to replace the first generation of [[London Underground Gate Stock|\"Gate Stock\"]] Tube trains or to provide additional trains for extensions built in the 1920s and early 1930s.\nStandard Stock cars consisted of motor cars (with a driver's cab, behind which was a \"switch compartment\" occupying approximately one-third of the length of the car), plus trailer cars and \"control trailers\" (with a driving cab but no motor). All were equipped with air operated sliding doors, although the guard's door on the earlier trains was a manually operated inward-opening hinged door.\n\n==1922 Stock prototype cars==\n\nFor evaluation purposes, in anticipation of the large number of cars that were to be built over the next several years, six experimental cars were ordered and had been delivered by February 1923. There were five trailers and one control trailer, which were marshalled between French-built [[London Underground Gate Stock|\"Gate Stock\"]] driving motor cars. A demonstration for the press took place on the Piccadilly line on 3 February 1923, after which the new cars and the French motor cars were moved by road to the Hampstead Line, entering service in August.{{sfn |Bruce |1988 |p=53}} The French motor cars were part of a batch of 20 which had been rebuilt with air-operated doors, to allow them to work with the [[London Underground 1920 Stock|1920 Stock]], the first batch of vehicles built with air doors.{{sfn |Bruce |1988 |p=49}} The trailers and French motor cars formed the inaugural train on the Hampstead Line extension from Golders Green to Hendon when it opened on 19 November 1923.{{sfn |Bruce |1968 |pp=44\u201345}}\n\nThe builders were given a partial specification, which ensured that each car would have 48 seats and two sets of air-operated double doors on each side, providing an opening which was {{convert|4.5|ft|m|3}} wide. Beyond these basic guidelines, each builder was allowed to build a trailer car to its own design, although externally, they looked very similar. The control trailer was designed by the [[Underground Electric Railways Company of London|Underground Electric Railways]].{{sfn |Bruce |1988 |p=53}}\nThe stock became known as the 1922 Stock or Competition Stock and was considered part of the Standard stock fleet.{{sfn |Hardy |2001 |p=54}}\n\n== Production stock ==\n[[File:London Underground tube coach (CJ Allen, Steel Highway, 1928).jpg|Interior|thumb]]\n[[File:London Underground Standard Stock - Flickr - James E. Petts (1).jpg|Switch compartment|thumb]]\nThe earliest Standard Stock was built for use on the [[Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway|Hampstead tube]], which was extended from [[Golders Green tube station|Golders Green]] to [[Edgware tube station|Edgware]] and from Clapham Common to [[Morden tube station|Morden]] in 1923, as well as incorporating the [[City and South London Railway]], which had been rebuilt with larger tunnels. 191 cars were ordered from three manufacturers in 1923, which were formed into five-car trains.{{sfn|Bruce |1988 |pp=53\u201354}} The City and South London Railway had been built with tunnels which were only {{convert|10.5|ft|m}} in diameter, and had used [[London Underground electric locomotives|small electric locomotives]] to haul trailer cars until it closed for rebuilding in 1923. The reconstruction was completed in 1925,{{sfn |Bruce |1988 |pp=7, 16}} and 69 of the new vehicles were owned by them, while the rest were owned by the London Electric Railway Company.{{sfn|Bruce |1988 |pp=53\u201354}}\n\nIn a departure from previous practice, where all traction control equipment had been supplied by [[British Thomson-Houston]] (BTH), most of the batch were fitted with equipment by Metropolitan-Vickers, which consisted of electro-magnetic contactors arranged to manage the acceleration of the train automatically, with switching from series to parallel connection of the motors handled by bridging them rather than open-circuiting them. Two motor cars had equipment by [[General Electric Company plc|General Electric Co]] (GEC), which worked similarly, and was required to work in multiple with the Metropolitan-Vickers equipment. All the vehicles used a C-type door operating engine, which proved to be a poor design. Another 127 cars were ordered in 1924, with most of the motor cars and some of the control trailers using GEC equipment. Cars with GEC controls used WT54 motors, which those with Metropolitan-Vickers equipment used MV152 motors, and although they were interchangeable in theory, in practice they were always kept in pairs. The 1924 cars were fitted with a D-type door engine, which was reclassified as a DL-type after a minor modification had to be made, but proved much more resilient than the earlier C-type, and was used on all Standard Stock until 1931.{{sfn |Bruce |1988 |pp=54\u201356}}\n\nDelivery of the cars was not easy, as the Hampstead Line did not have a mainline railway connection to any other line. Consequently, the bodies and bogies were delivered by road, and two large gantries were erected at both Morden and Golders Green depots. A traction engine would arrive at the site with the body, and would position it below the gantries. It would then be raised so that the road wheels could be removed, and a steam crane would position the bogies onto the track. Once the body and bogies were united, a steam engine would remove the complete car, to allow the next one to be assembled.{{sfn|Bruce |1968 |pp=42\u201343}}\n\nA further 120 cars were ordered in 1925, with both types of equipment, to cope with the opening of the junction at Kennington and the lengthening of trains to six cars and from 1926, seven cars. Motor cars seated 30 passengers, while trailers had 48 seats. Control trailers had a cab at one end, but no switch compartment, and so seated four less. Trains initially had a crew of three, consisting of a motorman, a front conductor, and a rear guard. The guard signalled the conductor that the train was ready to go, and the conductor signalled the motorman. Once the use of air-operated doors had proved to be successful, modifications were made to enable a train to be operated by a crew of two. Changes included the fitting of a telephone, so that the guard and motorman could communicate, interlocks to ensure that all doors were closed, and the re-routing of the starting bell, so that it could be operated by a guard at the rear of the train, rather than the conductor at the front. These changes were completed by 1927, allowing the reduction of the train crew.{{sfn |Bruce |1988 |pp=55\u201357}}\n\n=== 1926 and 1927 builds ===\nThe superior nature of the new trains helped to show up the inadequacies of plans to convert large numbers of gate stock cars to have air doors, and they were largely abandoned. Another 112 cars, all fitted with GEC equipment, were ordered from Metropolitan Carriage Wagon and Finance in 1926, and an order for 170 cars followed on in 1927. This enabled trains to be increased to seven cars, and more trains to be operated. A second order was placed with MCWF in 1927, for 136 more cars, but the traction control equipment was supplied by British Thomson-Houston. Their equipment generally proved to be more reliable, and previous batches of Standard Stock were modified so that the main contactors could be replaced with BTH equipment. BTH continued to be the preferred supplier for this equipment for the next 35 years. Metropolitan-Vickers supplied their own motors, but Standard Stock built by other manufacturers used GEC motors. The inter-operability of cars from several manufacturers with three types of traction control was the reason that they were called Standard Stock.{{sfn |Bruce |1988 |p=59}}\n\nThe 1927 builds used a 'Z' bogie, instead of the previous 'Y' bogie, which had wheels of {{convert|36|in|cm}} diameter, as opposed to {{convert|40|in|cm}}. This required a modification to the WT54 motors, supplied by GEC, which were then known as WT54A motors, and the gearing was altered so that cars with either size of wheels remained compatible. Trials with the 'loudaphone' system by which the guard and motorman could communicate on this stock resulted in it being retro-fitted to the earlier stock.{{sfn |Bruce |1988 |pp=59\u201361}}\n\nDuring this period, many of the Gate Stock cars on the Central line had been converted to air-door operation by the Union Construction Co., which was based at Feltham. Plans were briefly formulated to convert the Gate Stock on the Piccadilly and Bakerloo lines, but analysis showed that the cost of building a new car was only slightly more than the cost of converting an old one, and so an order for 182 new cars was placed. They were known as the 1927 Feltham Stock, although the door plates carried the date 1928, and they were not delivered until 1929 and 1930. The lightweight construction caused problems in later years, when the seat risers and body bolsters developed fractures. With the batch of cars built by MCWF and fitted with BTH equipment, these vehicles enabled Gate Stock to be withdrawn from the Piccadilly line in June 1929, and from the Bakerloo line on 1 January 1930.{{sfn |Bruce |1988 |p=62}}\n\n=== 1929 and 1930 builds ===\nAnother 53 cars were ordered from the Union Construction Co. in 1929, to enable the remaining 1920 Stock cars, which had air doors but were not really suitable for operation on the open sections of the Piccadilly line, to be transferred to the Bakerloo line. An extra train of two motor cars and four trailers was ordered in 1930, to test several new features. They were the last cars to be built by the Union Construction Co., for it was closed as a result of political pressure in 1932. The new motor cars were {{convert|1|ft|m|2}} longer, and the trailers were {{convert|2|ft|m}} longer. This was achieved by tapering one or both ends, to prevent them fouling the [[structure gauge]] on curves. On two of the trailers, the centre door openings were widened from {{convert|4|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}} to {{convert|5|ft|2|in|m|abbr=on}}. On the other two, the width of the centre doors was not altered, but the seating capacity was reduced from 48 to 40, to allow the provision of an additional single-leaf door at both ends of the car. The position of the guard's door control panel was altered, although this was not found to be satisfactory, and was dropped from subsequent builds.{{sfn |Bruce |1988 |pp=63\u201364}}\n\nBecause of the Piccadilly extensions, which were above ground, heaters were fitted, and the use of British materials in its construction was used for publicity purposes, at a time when there was an industrial depression. It became known as the 'All British' train, and operated on the Piccadilly and Northern lines. Transfer between the two was aided by the construction of a junction at Kings Cross in 1927. The Northern line offered heavier traffic, with which to assess the effectiveness of the new features. 62 production cars were ordered from Metropolitan-Cammell, which was formed from the Metropolitan Carriage Wagon and Finance Co. and Cammell Laird at this time, for delivery to the Bakerloo line. They replaced the Watford Joint Stock, which although relatively new, needed a larger crew and had to stop for longer at stations, because of its swing doors. Problems with the swing doors were highlighted by a fatal accident in which a passenger got caught in them, but the door interlock did not detect it.{{sfn |Bruce |1988 |pp=64\u201365}}\n\nThis build was not initially compatible with other builds, because it was fitted with an electro-pneumatic braking system, as well as the Westinghouse air brake. To accommodate its control, an extra 10-core control jumper was fitted, and previous builds of Standard Stock were gradually altered to include the extra wires, a process which was largely completed by 1936. Standard Stock motor cars which were running on the Bakerloo line with Cammell Laird 1920 Stock trailers were not fitted with the electro-pneumatic brake wiring until the trailers were withdrawn in 1938.{{sfn |Bruce |1988 |pp=65\u201366}}\n\n=== 1931 and 1934 builds ===\nIn 1929, government aid enabled plans for extensions to the Piccadilly line northwards to Cockfosters and westwards from [[Hammersmith tube station (District and Piccadilly lines)|Hammersmith]] to Acton Town, on tracks which were parallel to the District line but not shared with it, to come to fruition. The length of the line increased from {{convert|8.5|mi|km}} to {{convert|40|mi|km}}, and so more trains were needed. The improvements made for the 1930 build were incorporated into the design, as well as some new features. 145 motor cars were ordered from Metropolitan-Cammell, and 130 trailer cars were shared between two builders. All trailer cars had 12 doors, with two sets of double doors and a single-leaf door at both ends on each side. Electro-pneumatic brakes were fitted, as was a weak-field control, which enabled higher speed running and had been tested on the 1930 build. Its use on the Northern line had demonstrated that the same service intervals could be maintained with four fewer trains.{{sfn |Bruce |1988 |pp=67\u201369}}\n\nThe final build of Standard Stock was a small batch of 26 motor cars ordered from Metropolitan-Cammell in 1934, after the formation of the London Passenger Transport Board in the previous year. The Piccadilly line was extended from South Harrow to Uxbridge, and this required an extra eight seven-car trains. These were made up from the new motor cars and some reshuffling of stock between other lines. Although very similar to the 1931 build, there were some minor differences. The 1931 build had used motors with roller bearings for the first time, and ten of the new motor cars were also fitted with roller bearing axle boxes, to reduce the amount of maintenance required with white metal bearings.{{sfn |Bruce |1988 |p=69}} With the completion of the 1934 build, the total number of Standard Stock cars was 645 motor cars, 551 trailers and 270 control trailers.{{sfn |Bruce |1988 |p=127}}\n\n== Allocation ==\nBy the time the final cars had been delivered, the standard stock was operating on the Northern, Piccadilly and Bakerloo lines. There were 724 cars on the Northern line, consisting of 336 motor cars, 243 trailers and 145 control trailers. This group comprised all of the cars made in 1923, 1924, 1925 and 1926, supplemented by 62 per cent of the 1927 build by Metropolitan, and 13 of the 1927-built Feltham cars. The Piccadilly line had 509 cars, comprising some of the 1927 Metropolitan and Feltham batches, most of the 1929 Feltham stock, the experimental 1930 Feltham train, and all of the 1931 and 1934 stock. The Bakerloo line also had some of the 1927 Metropolitan and Feltham batches, four cars from the 1929 Feltham build and the 1930 Metropolitan stock. This was a total of 198 cars, made up of 82 motor cars, 62 trailers and 54 control trailers. To make up the number of trains, an additional 20 trailers and 20 control trailers were needed, and these were cars of 1920 Cammell Laird air-door stock.{{sfn |Bruce |1988 |p=127}}\n\nBetween 1935 and 1940, the London Underground benefited from a New Works Programme worth \u00a340 million. This included extensions to the Northern line and the Central line, with delivery of new trains of [[London Underground 1938 Stock|1938 Stock]] beginning in May 1938. The intention was to run the new trains on the Northern line, and transfer the displaced Standard Stock to the Central line, which was using stock built in 1900\u20131903. In addition, some of the displaced stock would be used on the Moorgate-Finsbury Park \"Highbury Branch\", also known as the [[Northern City Line]], and some would be used to increase the length of trains on the Bakerloo line to seven cars. 82 control trailers were converted to trailers, and 21 driving motor cars were altered from \"A\" cars to \"D\" cars, as the makeup of 7 car trains on the Bakerloo and Central lines had the three-car unit at the opposite end to those on the Northern line.{{sfn |Hardy |1986 |pp=70-71}}\n\nThe Northern City Line had previously been served by surface stock, and had to be modified to accommodate the Standard Stock. Additionally, it had a non-standard arrangement of the third and fourth rails which supplied power to the cars, and these were modified to the same configuration as on the Northern line during the refurbishment.{{sfn |Hardy |1986 |p=71}} The use of control trailers at one end of a short train was virtually discontinued during the 1930s, because of the risks of disruption to services. A 3-car train consisted on a driving motor car, a trailer and a control trailer (DM-T-CT) and only had one compressor on the motor car. If it failed, the train was stranded, causing delays, whereas a 4-car short train had two motor cars (DM-T-T-DM) and hence two compressors. Failure of one did not prevent the train continuing.{{sfn|Hardy|2001|p=31}} The exception to the use of control trailers was the off-peak trains on the Northern City Line, which consisted of a driving motor car and a control trailer, and these 2-car trains continued to run until October 1964.{{sfn |Hardy |1981 |p=17}}\n\n===Central line===\nOn the [[Central line (London Underground)|Central line]], Standard Stock began replacing the [[London Underground 1900/1903 Stock|1900/1903 Stock]] in the autumn of 1938, and this action was completed by mid-1939. The Central line used a three-rail system, with a central conductor rail supplying the power, and was not converted to a four-rail system until May 1940. All of the trains were therefore converted to work with the three-rail system as an interim measure, and then converted back to four-rail operation once the track had been modified.{{sfn |Hardy |1986 |p=71}}\n\nAt the time, extensions to [[West Ruislip tube station|West Ruislip]], [[Epping tube station|Epping]] and [[Hainault tube station|Hainault]] were under construction, which would require more trains, but the onset of the [[Second World War]] resulted in the extensions being postponed. Nearly 200 cars were stored in the partially built Hainault depot, but that was then requisitioned by the U.S. Army Transportation Corps, and the cars were moved to open sidings. Others were stored on sidings at Edgware, Golders Green, Highgate, Morden, Neasden, and Stanmore, as well as in depots where there was spare capacity. Some of the motor cars were painted grey, and used for engineering duties. Some trains were used for \"Tube Refreshment Specials\", supplying food and drink to people sheltering from air raids on the underground platforms.{{sfn |Hardy |2001 |p=33}}\n\nAfter the war ended, the Central line extensions opened, reaching Stratford on 4 December 1946, Newbury Park and Woodford on 14 December 1947, West Ruislip, Loughton and Hainault on 21 November 1948, and Epping on 25 September 1949.{{sfn |Bruce |1968 |pp=75-76}} The effects of six or more years of open-air storage on the Standard Stock was severe, and a programme of heavy refurbishment began, which included replacement of warped window frames, renewal of corroded equipment as necessary, and in many cases, complete rewiring. Stations had been lengthened to accommodate 8-car trains before the war, but trains were restricted to 6 cars until the depot at White City could be altered. Some 7-car trains began operating from November 1947, and 8-car trains from the following January. However, the reliability of the refurbished cars was poor, and a full service of 8-car trains was not achieved{{sfn |Hardy |2001 |pp=36-37}} until additional cars became available from other lines, following the delivery of the [[London Underground 1959 Stock|1959 Stock]]. The achievement was short-lived, as all Standard Stock had been withdrawn from the Central line less than three years later.{{sfn |Bruce |1968 |pp=76-77}}\n\n8-car trains were formed of two 4-car units, each consisting of two driving motor cars and two trailers (DM-T-T-DM). This arrangement was not ideal at busy times, since there was a section in the middle of the train where there were no passenger doors for almost {{convert|50|ft|m}}, caused by the switch compartments behind the driving cabs. In order to alleviate the problem, one of the four-car units was split, and two cars were placed at either end of the other unit. The formation from 1961 thus became DM-T x DM-T-T-DM x T-DM, which reduced loading times at peak periods.{{sfn |Bruce |1988 |p=72}}\n\n== Disposal ==\n1938 Stock replaced the Standard Stock on the Bakerloo line, the changeover being completed on 23 May 1949,{{sfn |Bruce |1988 |p=72}} although a batch of 1927-built trailers (usually referred to as \"58 trailers\" because of the number of cars in the group rather than a year reference, as was normally the case with Tube stock classes) were converted to operate with the new stock on the Bakerloo line.{{sfn |Hardy |1976 |p=76}} The Standard Stock on the Piccadilly line was eventually replaced by the [[London Underground 1959 Stock|1959 Stock]]. This enabled the first large-scale withdrawals and scrapping of Standard Stock, although some of the better cars were transferred to the Central line to complete the 8-car trains.{{sfn |Bruce |1968 |p=76}}\n\nLondon Transport intended to use the prototype [[London Underground 1960 Stock|1960 Stock]] to develop new trains to replace the Standard Stock on the Central line: however, the condition of the 30\u201340 year-old Central line fleet were deteriorating under an intense service pattern, exacerbated by growing demand from the expansion of electric trains in the [[Eastern Region of British Railways]].{{sfn |Hardy |1981 |p=25}} The situation escalated with a [[List of London Underground accidents#Holland Park and Redbridge fires|fatal electrical fire]] on car 3465 near Holland Park in 1958, and another (non-fatal) fire on car 3673 near Redbridge in 1960.{{sfn |Bruce |1988 |p=72}}\n\nIn response to the fires, London Transport diverted 57 of the 76 trains from the [[London Underground 1959 Stock|1959 Stock]] to debut on the Central line instead of the Piccadilly line, and ordered another 57 non-driving motor cars that would later form part of the near-identical [[London Underground 1962 Stock|1962 Stock]].{{sfn |Bruce |1968 |p=87}} London Transport also retained some Standard Stock cars from the Piccadilly line to replace the worst performing cars on the Central line.<ref name=\"Connor\">{{cite journal|last=Connor|first=Piers|title=The London Electric Train|journal=Underground News|date=January 2017|issue=668|page=540|publisher=London Underground Railway Society|issn=0306-8617}}</ref>\n\nLondon Transport withdrew the last Standard Stock trains from the Central line in June 1963. The arrival of the 1962 stock in the previous year then allowed the 1959 stock to complete the withdrawal of the Standard Stock from the Piccadilly line by July 1964, which in turn allowed the 1938 Stock to replace the last Standard Stock trains from the Northern City Line, on 3 November 1966.{{sfn|Hardy|1981|p=25}}<ref name=\"Connor\"/>\n\nA number of motor cars saw further service as [[London Underground departmental stock|departmental vehicles]]. 16 were used as ballast motor cars, with many of them lasting until 1978, and four were used as pilot motor cars.{{sfn |Bruce |1987 |pp=91-92}} Motor car 3327 was displayed in the Science Museum, London, for many years, but returned to the London Transport Museum in 1996.{{sfn |Hardy |2002 |p=60}}\n\n== Isle of Wight ==\n[[File:Ryde Pier Head Martin Addison.jpg|thumb|1927 Stock train arriving at [[Ryde Pier Head station.]]]]\nPrior to 1950, there were {{convert|55.5|mi|km}} of steam-operated railways on the [[Isle of Wight]]. This was reduced to {{convert|25.5|mi|km}} between 1952 and 1956, and to just {{convert|8.5|mi|km}} in 1966. The Ryde Pier Head\u2013Shanklin section (the [[Island Line, Isle of Wight|Island Line]]) was retained and electrified,{{sfn |Hardy |2003 |p=9}} but because of the restricted loading gauge at Ryde Tunnels, smaller-than-normal trains were required.{{sfn |Hardy |2003 |p=4}}\n\nThe [[Southern Region of British Railways|Southern Region]] approached London Transport in 1961, to begin negotiations for some of the Standard Stock then being withdrawn. The initial plan was to fit diesel engines into the motor cars, and to use either electric or mechanical transmission.{{sfn |Hardy |2003 |pp=10\u201311}} The first twelve cars were transferred from [[Ruislip]] Depot to [[Wimbledon station|Wimbledon]] in August 1964, from where they were moved to [[Micheldever]] sidings. Further cars followed in June 1965.{{sfn |Hardy |2003 |pp=12\u201313}} In October, a plan to electrify the line was announced, and the idea of fitting diesel engines was dropped. In 1966, the Southern Region had 44 cars at Micheldever, and London Transport had 29 more which were set aside for the scheme. 10 of the Micheldever cars were scrapped, and 12 more were obtained from London Transport.{{sfn |Hardy |2003 |pp=14\u201315}}\n\nOverhaul of the electrical and braking systems was done at Acton Works, which involved transferring the cars from Micheldever back to London Transport. This included conversion to work with a [[Third rail|three-rail]] system, rather than the standard London Transport [[Railway electrification system#Fourth rail|four-rail]] system. The number of cars to be shipped to the Isle of Wight was reduced from 46 to 43 because of the cost of this work. After overhaul, the cars were transferred to [[Stewarts Lane]], where they were repainted in British Rail blue, and were then taken to the Isle of Wight.{{sfn |Hardy |2003 |pp=16\u201317}} They were loaded onto a road vehicle at [[Fratton railway station|Fratton]] belonging to the haulage company [[Pickfords]], and crossed to the island on the [[Wightlink|Portsmouth to Fishbourne ferry]]. Care was needed to ensure that the weather and tides were suitable, and motor cars had to be transferred on special sailings, rather than regular crossings, because of the difficulty of unloading a vehicle of this weight without damaging the ship's unloading ramp.{{sfn |Hardy |2003 |p=18}}\n\nThe cars were formed into 4-car and 3-car units, initially designated as 4-VEC and 3-TIS units.{{sfn |Hardy |2003 |p=18}} Subsequently, they became Classes 452 and 451, and were later reclassified to become [[British Rail Classes 485 and 486|Classes 485 and 486]]. Apart from those cut up following accidents at [[Ryde depot]], and other early withdrawals, most of these units were withdrawn between 1988 and 1991,{{sfn |Hardy |2003 |p=90}} when they were replaced by [[London Underground 1938 Stock]]. In October 1990, five cars were returned to London Transport, to form a Heritage Train. They worked under their own power between Fratton and Wimbledon, and were displayed at an open day at Morden Depot, celebrating 100 years of the Northern line.{{sfn |Hardy |2003 |pp=48\u201352}}\n\n== Manufacturers ==\nStandard Stock is used to describe six experimental cars built by five manufacturers in 1923, and 18 batches of production cars, totalling 1460 vehicles, built by six manufacturers between 1923 and 1934.<ref>{{harvnb |Bruce |1988 |p=127}} (table data included)</ref> It became the most prolific class of stock to run on the Underground,{{sfn |Hardy |1986 |p=4}} which was partly due to the [[Trade Facilities Act 1921]]. This was a government initiative in the aftermath of the [[First World War]] to fund schemes which would create employment, particularly in the construction, steel and manufacturing industries. The Underground benefited from \u00a35 million of investment from this source, which in addition to funding extensions to the Northern line, financed the construction of over 1,100 Standard Stock cars between 1922 and 1930.{{sfn |Halliday |2013 |pp=101-105}}\n{|\n|\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Builder\n!Motors\n!Trailers\n!Control<br>Trailers\n!Notes\n|-\n|rowspan=8; align=center |1923\n|align=center|BRCW\n|align=center|\u2014\n|align=center|1\n|align=center|\u2014\n|rowspan=5|Experimental<br>stock\n|-\n|align=center|CLCo\n|align=center|\u2014\n|align=center|1\n|align=center|\u2014\n|-\n|align=center|GRCW\n|align=center|\u2014\n|align=center|1\n|align=center|1\n|-\n|align=center|Leeds\n|align=center|\u2014\n|align=center|1\n|align=center|\u2014\n|-\n|align=center|MCWF\n|align=center|\u2014\n|align=center|1\n|align=center|\u2014\n|-\n|align=center|BRCW\n|align=center|\u2014\n|align=center|35\n|align=center|-\n|rowspan=18|Production<br />stock\n|-\n|align=center|CLCo\n|align=center|41\n|align=center|40\n|align=center|\u2014\n|-\n|align=center|MCWF\n|align=center|40\n|align=center|\u2014\n|align=center|35\n|-\n|rowspan=3; align=center |1924\n|align=center|BRCW\n|align=center|\u2014\n|align=center|50\n|align=center|\u2014\n|-\n|align=center|CLCo\n|align=center|\u2014\n|align=center|\u2014\n|align=center|25\n|-\n|align=center|MCWF\n|align=center|52\n|align=center|\u2014\n|align=center|\u2014\n|-\n|rowspan=2; align=center |1925\n|align=center|CLCo\n|align=center|48\n|align=center|\u2014\n|align=center|\u2014\n|-\n|align=center|MCWF\n|align=center|\u2014\n|align=center|5\n|align=center|67\n|-\n|align=center |1926\n|align=center|MCWF\n|align=center|64\n|align=center|48\n|align=center|\u2014\n|-\n|rowspan=2; align=center |1927\n|align=center|MCWF\n|align=center|110\n|align=center|160\n|align=center|36\n|-\n|align=center|UCC\n|align=center|77\n|align=center|37\n|align=center|68\n|-\n|align=center |1929\n|align=center|UCC\n|align=center|18\n|align=center|17\n|align=center|18\n|-\n|rowspan=2; align=center|1930\n|align=center|MCCW\n|align=center|22\n|align=center|20\n|align=center|20\n|-\n|align=center|UCC\n|align=center|2\n|align=center|4\n|align=center|\u2014\n|-\n|rowspan=3; align=center|1931\n|align=center|BRCW\n|align=center|\u2014\n|align=center|90\n|align=center|\u2014\n|-\n|align=center|GRCW\n|align=center|\u2014\n|align=center|40\n|align=center|\u2014\n|-\n|align=center|MCCW\n|align=center|145\n|align=center|\u2014\n|align=center|\u2014\n|-\n|align=center|1934\n|align=center|MCCW\n|align=center|26\n|align=center|\u2014\n|align=center|\u2014\n|-\n!Totals\n|align=center|1,466\n|align=center|645\n|align=center|551\n|align=center|270\n| &nbsp;\n|}\n|valign=\"top\"|\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=2|Key to Builders\n|-\n|BRCW\n|[[Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company|Birmingham Railway Carriage & Wagon Co.]]\n|-\n|CLCo\n|[[Cammell Laird|Cammell Laird & Co.

A caravan stopping point during the [[Himyarite Kingdom]], the Haraz was later the stronghold of the [[Sulayhid dynasty]], which was established in Yemen in 1037. Then and subsequently the population have been [[Ism'aili]] [[Shia Islam|Shi'ite]] [[Muslim]]s.\n\nHaraz is as famous for its fortified villages which cling to nearly inaccessible rocky peaks. Their imposing architecture meets two needs: defending the villagers, while leaving plenty of space for crops. Each town is built like a castle; the houses, themselves, form the wall, equipped with one or two easily defensible doors. Constructed from sandstone and basalt, the buildings are integrated into the landscape and it is difficult to tell where the rock and the village begins or ends. The mountain is divided into terraces of a few acres or more, separated by walls sometimes several meters high. On these terraced fields grow alfalfa for livestock, millet, lentils, large areas for coffee and [[Khat|qat]].\n\nWithin a day's journey are [[Bani Murrah]] and other villages located on the ridge overlooking [[Manakhah]]. Manakhah is the heart of mountain range, a large town whose market attracts villagers from the entire neighbourhood. [[Al Hajjara]], to the west of Manakhah, is a walled village whose citadel was founded in the 12th century by the Sulayhids. From there, other villages are accessible, such as [[Bayt al-Qamus]]  and [[Bayt Shimran]]. The village of [[Hutaib]] is built on a platform of red sandstone, facing a view of terraced hills which host a score of villages. Here also is the mausoleum of the third Yemeni ''[[Da'i al-Mutlaq]]'' [[Hatim ibn Ibrahim]].

On March 1 of 1980, the first Principal Byeong-sip Seo was inaugurated, and on March 5 the first freshman entered. At this time, 10 classes per grade were accredited and the number of classes continued to increase.\n21 years after the school was established, the plan to change the location was approved. The groundbreaking ceremony was held on April 27, 2001. On February 28, 2002, it was moved to 37, Uksu-gil, Suseong-gu, Daegu. In the same year, Cheongramsa ([[Hangeul]]: \uccad\ub78c\uc0ac; [[Hanja]]: \u9751\u85cd\u820d), dormitory was opened.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n\n* [[Taeghwan Hyeon]] '80, chemist, director of [[Institute for Basic Science|IBS]], AE of [[Journal of the American Chemical Society|JACS]]\n* Jeong-su Kim '80, Lieutenant General, Commander of [[Republic of Korea Army Special Warfare Command]]\n* [[:ko:\ubc15\uacbd\ucca0|Kyung-cheol Park]] '80, doctor, writer of 'A Beautiful Walk with Rustic Doctor(\uc2dc\uace8\uc758\uc0ac\uc758 \uc544\ub984\ub2e4\uc6b4 \ub3d9\ud589)'\n* Seong-yong Youn '82, Director of [[National Folk Museum of Korea]]\n* An-su Park '83, Major General, Commander of The 39th Infantry Division(Republic of Korea)\n* [[:ko:\ud64d\uc9c0\ub9cc|Ji-man Hong]] '84, former journalist, former member of the [[National Assembly of the Republic of Korea]]\n* [[E Sens]](Min-ho Kang) '03, rapper\n\n== External links ==\n* {{official website}}\n\n{{Coord missing|South Korea}}\n\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1980]]\n[[Category:High schools in Daegu]]\n\n{{SouthKorea-school-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Korhistorystudy", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eNotable alumni", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dukwon_High_School"}

T., Koehnke S. S. (2016): On the nature of creepiness, New Ideas in Psychology, Vol.4</ref> investigated the characteristics that make people creepy. Creepy people were thought to be more often male than female by an overwhelming majority of participants (around 95% of both males and females participants).<ref name=\"McA\" />{{rp|12}}  Another study conducted by Watt et al. also found that participants associated the [[ectomorphic]] body type (more linear) with creepiness, more than the other two body types (51% vs [[mesomorphic]], 24% and [[endomorphic]], 23%). Other cues of creepiness included low hygiene, especially according to female participants, and a dishevelled appearance .  Participants also identified the face as an area with potentially creepy features: in particular the eyes and the teeth.  Both of those physical features were deemed creepy not only for their unpleasant appearance (ex. squinty eyes or crooked teeth) but also for the movements and expressions they engaged it (ex. darting eye movements and odd smiles).<ref name=\"Watt\" />{{rp|61}}  \n\nIn fact, appearance doesn\u2019t seem to be the only factor making an individual creepy: behaviours provide cues as well.<ref name=\"Watt\" />{{rp|58}} Behaviours such as \u201cbeing unusually quiet and staring (34%), following or lurking (15%), behaving abnormally (21%), or in a socially awkward, \"sketchy\" or suspicious way (20%)\u201d are all contributing to a feeling of creepiness, as described by Watt et al.\u2019s study.<ref name=\"Watt\" />{{rp|61}}\n  \n=== Technology ===\nIn addition to other individuals, new technologies, such as marketing\u2019s targeted ads and AI, have been qualified as creepy.\n\nA study by Moore et al <ref name=\"Moore\">Moore R. S., Moore M. L., Shanahan K. J., Horky A., Mack B.(2015): Creepy marketing: three dimensions of perceived excessive online privacy violation, Marketing Management Journal, Vol.25</ref> described what aspect of marketing participants considered creepy. The main three reasons are the following: using invasive tactics, causing discomfort and violating of norms. Invasive tactics are practiced by marketers that know so much about the consumer that the ads are \u201ccreepily\u201d personalised. Secondly, some ads create discomfort by making the consumer question \u201cthe motives of the company advertising the product\u201d. Finally, some ads violate social norms by having inappropriate content, for example by unnecessarily sexualizing it.<ref name=\"Moore\" />{{rp|48}}\n\nIt is marketing\u2019s extensive knowledge used in an improper way, together with a certain loss of control over our data, that creates a feeling of creepiness.<ref name=\"Moore\" />{{rp|44}} \n\nAnother creepy aspect of technology is human looking AI: this phenomenon is called the [[uncanny valley]].\n\nHumans find robots creepy when they start closely resembling humans. It has been hypothesised that the reason why they are viewed as creepy is because they violate our notion of how a robot should look. A study focusing on children's responses to this phenomenon found evidence to support the hypothesis.<ref>Brink K. A., Gray K. and Wellman H.M. (2019): Creepiness Creeps In: Uncanny Valley Feelings Are Acquired in Childhood, Child Dev, Vol.90</ref>{{rp|1210}}\n\n==Evolutionary explanation==\nSeveral studies have hypothesized that creepiness is an evolutionary response to potentially dangerous situations.<ref name=\"McA\" />{{rp|10}}   It could be linked to a mechanism called [[agency detection]] which makes individuals expect malignant agents to be responsible for small changes in our environment. McAndrew et al. illustrates the idea with the example of a person hearing some noises while walking in a dark alley. That person would go in high alert, fearing that some dangerous individual was there. If that wasn\u2019t the case the loss would be small. If, on the other hand, a dangerous individual was actually in the alley and the person had not been alerted by this creepy feeling, the loss could have been significant.<ref name=\"McA\" />{{rp|11}} \n\nCreepiness would therefore serve the purpose of alerting us in situations in which the danger isn\u2019t outright obvious but rather ambiguous. In this case, ambiguity both refers to the possible presence of a threat and to its nature, sexual or physical for example.<ref name=\"McA\" />{{rp|10}} Creepiness \u201cmay reside in between the unknowing and the fear\u201d<ref name=\"Watt\" />{{rp|58}} in the sense that individuals experiencing it are unsure if there truly is something to fear or not. Truth is that creepy characteristics are not simply caused by threat potential: in fact, [[ectomorphic]] body types are not the most powerful bodies and facial expressions are not a proxy of physical strength either.<ref name=\"Watt\" />{{rp|63}} Therefore, creepiness isn\u2019t only related to how threatening a characteristic is, in the sense of how dangerous and strong the individual can be. There are more facets to consider.\n\nAnother characteristic of creepiness is unpredictable behaviour.<ref name=\"McA\" />{{rp|12}} Unpredictability links back to this idea of ambiguity.<ref name=\"McA\" />{{rp|11}} When an individual is unpredictable it isn\u2019t possible to tell when his behaviour will turn violent: this adds to the ambiguity of a potentially dangerous situation. This theory is endorsed by studies. Not only is unpredictability directly listed as a creepy characteristic<ref name=\"McA\" />{{rp|13}}, but other behaviours, such as norm-breaking behaviours are indirectly linked with unpredictability. Such behaviours show that the individual doesn\u2019t conform to some social standards we would expect in a given situation. <ref name=\"Leander\">Leander N. P., Chartrand T. L., Bargh J. A. (2012): You give me the chills: Embodied reactions to inappropriate amounts of behavioral mimicry, Psychological Science, Vol.23</ref>{{rp|773}}  For example, we previously mentioned staring at strangers or lack of hygiene: those are behaviours that make us uneasy, creeped out, because they don\u2019t fit the norm and therefore we don\u2019t expect them. More generally, participants tended to define creepiness as \u201cdifferent\u201d in the sense of not behaving, or looking, socially acceptable.<ref name=\"Watt\" />{{rp|62}} Such differences point towards a \u201csocial mismatch\u201d.<ref name=\"McA\" />{{rp|10}} \n\nHumans have a natural system of detection of such mismatch: a physical feeling of coldness.<ref name=\"McA\" />{{rp|10}} When an individual is creeped out, they report feeling those \u201ccold chills\u201d. This phenomenon has been studied by Leander et al, with relation to nonverbal mimicry in social interactions, meaning the unintentional copying of another\u2019s behaviour. Inappropriate mimicry may leave a person feeling like something is off about the other.<ref name=\"Leander\" />{{rp|772}} Absence of non-verbal mimicry in a friendly interaction, or the presence of it in a professional setting, raises suspicion as it doesn\u2019t follow the norms.

Cooke is best known for his death in hand-to-hand combat with French forces during the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805. During the action, his ship {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} was badly damaged and boarded by sailors and marines from the French [[ship of the line]] {{Ship|French ship|Aigle|1800|2}}. Cooke was killed in the ensuing melee, but his crew successfully drove off their opponents and ultimately forced the surrender of ''Aigle''.\n\nAside from his death, remarkably little is known of Cooke's circumstances, as unlike many of his fellow officers, Cooke was never a notable society figure. He was however well respected in his profession and following his death was the subject of tributes from officers who had served alongside him. Memorials to him were placed in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and his local church in [[Wiltshire]].\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Cooke was baptised on 5 March 1762 at [[St. Mary, Whitechapel]], the second son of Francis Cooke, an [[Admiralty]] clerk, and his wife Margaret.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{Ref label|A|a|none}} John Cooke first went to sea at the age of eleven aboard the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] {{HMS|Greyhound|1763|6}} under Lieutenant [[John Bazely]], before going ashore to spend time at Mr Braken's naval academy at [[Greenwich]]. He was entered onto the books of one of the [[royal yacht]]s by [[Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport|Sir Alexander Hood]], who would become an enduring patron of Cooke's.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} In 1776 he obtained a position as a [[midshipman]] on the [[ship of the line]] {{HMS|Eagle|1774|6}}, aged thirteen.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Cooke served aboard ''Eagle'', the flagship of the [[North American Station]], during the next three years, seeing extensive action along the eastern seaboard. Notable among these actions were the naval operations around the [[Battle of Rhode Island]] in 1778, when ''Eagle'' was closely engaged with American units ashore.{{r|\"ODNB\"}} He distinguished himself in the assault, causing Admiral [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]] to remark \"Why, young man, you wish to become a Lieutenant before you are of sufficient age.\"{{r|\"NT:95\"}} On 21 January 1779, Cooke was promoted to [[lieutenant]] and joined {{HMS|Superb|1760|6}} in the East Indies under [[Edward Hughes (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Edward Hughes]], but was forced to take a leave of absence due to ill-health.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\nCooke returned to England and then went to France to spend a year studying, before rejoining the navy in 1782 with an appointment to the 90-gun {{HMS|Duke|1777|6}} under Captain [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Alan Gardner]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Cooke saw action at the [[Battle of the Saintes]], at which ''Duke'' was heavily engaged. He remained with Gardner following the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, bringing an end to the American War of Independence, and served as his first-lieutenant aboard his next command, the 50-gun {{HMS|Europa|1783|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Gardner became commodore at [[Jamaica]], flying his [[broad pennant]] aboard ''Europa'' and retaining Cooke as his first-lieutenant until Cooke was injured in a bad fall and had to be invalided home.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} He had recovered sufficiently by the time of the [[Spanish Armament]] in 1790 to be able to take up an appointment from his old patron, Sir Alexander Hood, to be third-lieutenant of his flagship, the 90-gun {{HMS|London|1766|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{r|\"ODNB\"}} When the crisis passed without breaking into open war, ''London'' was paid off and Cooke went ashore.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\n==Frigate command==\nWith the outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] in February 1793, Cooke rejoined Hood and became first-lieutenant of his new flagship, the 100-gun {{HMS|Royal George|1788|6}}, part of the [[Channel Fleet]]. On 21 February 1794, Cooke was promoted to [[commander]] and given his first independent command, the small [[fireship]] {{HMS|Incendiary|1782|6}}. Three months later, ''Incendiary'' was a signal repeater for the Channel Fleet during the [[Atlantic campaign of May 1794]], relaying [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe's]] signals to the fleet and operating as a scout in the search for the French fleet under [[Villaret de Joyeuse]]. On 1 June 1794, Cooke was a witness to the battle of the [[Glorious First of June]], although his tiny ship was far too small to engage in combat.{{r|\"JW1:126\"}} In the action's aftermath, Cooke was included in the general promotions issued to the fleet, becoming a [[post captain]] on 23 July 1794. For a year, Cooke was stationed off [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] as [[flag captain]] to [[James Wallace (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Wallace]] aboard the 74-gun {{HMS|Monarch|1765|6}}, before returning to Britain and being offered command of the 28-gun {{HMS|Tourterelle|1795|6}}.{{r|\"NT:96\"}} Cooke accepted, but when he found out she was ordered to the West Indies, he resigned it, having been told by Gardner that further service in the West Indies would likely kill him.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nInstead in early 1796 he took command of the 36-gun [[frigate]] {{HMS|Nymphe|1780|6}}. ''Nymphe'' was employed in the blockade of the French Atlantic ports over the next year, and on 9 March 1797 was in company with {{HMS|St Fiorenzo|1794|6}} when they encountered the returning ships of a short-lived [[Battle of Fishguard|French invasion attempt]] of Britain that had been defeated at [[Fishguard]] in [[Wales]].{{r|\"JW2:80\"}} The French ships attempted to escape into [[Brest, France|Brest]], but were hunted down by the British, who forced the surrender of [[French ship R\u00e9sistance|''R\u00e9sistance'']] and [[French ship Constance|''Constance'']] in turn after successive short engagements.{{r|\"JH:45\"}} Neither of the British ships suffered a single casualty in the combat, and both French ships were subsequently purchased into the Royal Navy, bringing [[prize money]] to Cooke and his crew.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=14035|page=764|date=8 August 1797}}</ref>\n\nDespite this success, Cooke was unpopular with his men due to the strict discipline he enforced aboard his ship. This was graphically demonstrated just two months after the action off Brest, when ''Nymphe'' became embroiled in the [[Spithead and Nore mutinies|Spithead mutiny]]. Cooke attempted to assist Admiral [[John Colpoys]] at the mutiny's outbreak, and was ordered ashore by his crew when he tried to return to his ship. Cooke was tactfully removed from command by the Admiralty following the mutiny, although he was returned to service two years later aboard the new frigate {{HMS|Amethyst|1799|6}} in preparation for the Anglo-Russian invasion of the [[Batavian Republic]].{{r|\"CW:48\"}} During the invasion, ''Amethyst'' conveyed the [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] to the Netherlands and later participated in the evacuation of the force following the campaign's collapse.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nCooke was involved in operations in [[Quiberon Bay]] during the remainder of 1799, and in 1800 participated in an abortive invasion of [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]]. During this time, ''Amethyst'' captured six French merchant ships and small privateers.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15301|page=1176|date=11 October 1800}}</ref> During 1801, Cooke participated in the capture of the {{Ship|French frigate|D\u00e9daigneuse|1797|2|up=yes}} off [[Cape Finisterre]], helping [[Samuel Hood Linzee]] and [[Sir Richard King, 2nd Baronet|Richard King]] chase her down on 26 January. ''Amethyst'' was not heavily engaged with ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' and received no damage, but aided in pursuing and trapping the French ship so that she could be seized. ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' was later purchased into the Royal Navy as HMS ''Dedaigneuse''.{{r|\"JW3:136\"}} Shortly afterwards, Cooke captured the Spanish ship ''Carlotta'' and the French [[privateer]] ''G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Brune'' in the same area.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15412|page=1203|date=29 September 1801}}</ref>\n\n==Trafalgar==\n[[File:Trafalgar aufstellung.jpg|thumb|Battle of Trafalgar]]\nWith the [[Peace of Amiens]], Cooke briefly retired on half-pay before being recalled to the fleet at the outbreak of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1803. Cooke was requested as flag captain by Admiral [[William Young (1751\u20131821)|Sir William Young]] at [[Plymouth]], but Cooke tactfully refused, instead applying for active service. He received command of {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} on 25 April 1805. In May, after the large combined French and Spanish fleet, under Admiral [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve]] escaped from [[Toulon]], beginning the [[Trafalgar Campaign]], Cooke was ordered to join a flying squadron under Vice-Admiral [[Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood|Cuthbert Collingwood]]. The squadron arrived off [[Cadiz]] on 9 June and Collingwood detached ''Bellerophon'' and three other ships to blockade [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] under Rear-Admiral [[Sir Richard Bickerton, 2nd Baronet|Sir Richard Bickerton]]. When the combined fleet entered Cadiz on 20 August, Collingwood recalled Bickerton's force and mounted a blockade of the port. Collingwood was reinforced with more ships, and was later superseded by Nelson. Cooke was heard to say at this time that \"To be in a general engagement with [[Horatio Nelson|Nelson]] would crown all my military ambition\".{{r|\"ODNB\"}} Nelson had Villeneuve's fleet trapped in Cadiz and was blockading the harbour awaiting their expected attempt to escape.\n\nThe Franco-Spanish fleet escaped Cadiz on 18 October 1805, but was soon chased down by Nelson and brought to battle on 21 October. Nelson formed his fleet into two divisions; the weather column would attack to the north under his direct command and the lee column would operate to the south under the command of Cuthbert Collingwood in {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|1786|6}}. Cooke was stationed fifth in Collingwood's line, and so was one of the first ships engaged in action with the combined fleet. Cooke took the unusual step of informing his first lieutenant [[William Pryce Cumby]] and his master Edward Overton of Nelson's orders, in case he should be killed.{{r|\"CW:47\"}}\n\n''Bellerophon'' was soon closely engaged with the French, breaking through the enemy line and closing with [[French ship Aigle (1800)|''Aigle'']]. As with the other French ships in the fleet, ''Aigle's'' rigging and mastheads were occupied by musketeers and grenadiers, who kept up a steady fire on ''Bellerophon'' and took a heavy toll of sailors exposed on the British ship's deck. Much of the fire was directed at the quarterdeck, where Cooke, Cumby and Overton stood. Cumby noted with surprise that Cooke was still wearing his uniform coat, which sported epaulettes that marked him out as the ship's captain to French snipers. Cooke had forgotten to remove the epaulettes and recognised the danger they represented, but replied \"It is too late to take them off. I see my situation, but I will die like a man\".{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n[[File:Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Coloured print of a naval battle between sailing ships. Four ships seen stern on in the right of the picture, obscured by clouds of smoke, a fifth ship seen bow on in the left.|''Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke'', early-nineteenth century aquatint by [[Thomas Whitcombe]], showing the ''Bellerophon'' surrounded by enemy ships at the moment of Cooke's death]]\nAs the action continued, the Captain Pierre-Paul Gour\u00e8ge of ''Aigle'' ordered his crew to board and seize ''Bellerophon'', hoping to use their superiority of numbers to overwhelm the British crew. Cooke sent Cumby below to make sure that the lower-deck guns continued to fire into the French ship as the battle continued overhead, and threw himself at the French sailors pouring onto ''Bellerophon's'' quarterdeck, shooting an enemy officer dead and engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the men behind him.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Within minutes Cumby had returned to the deck with reinforcements from below, passing the mortally wounded Overton on the ladder. The badly wounded ship's quartermaster was also present, and he informed Cumby that Cooke had fallen in the melee.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Cumby's charge cleared the French from the deck of ''Bellerophon'', and he found Cooke dead on the quarterdeck, two [[musket]] balls lodged in his chest. Cooke's last words had been \"Let me lie quietly a minute. Tell Lieutenant Cumby never to strike.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n\nCumby took charge of the battered ''Bellerophon'', directing her fire into ''Aigle'' and ultimately forcing the French ship's surrender after the arrival of other British vessels. ''Bellerophon'' had suffered grievously, losing 27 dead and 127 wounded.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Although ''Aigle'' was lost in the chaotic storm which followed the battle, ''Bellerophon'' survived, primarily due to Cumby's leadership. He was later promoted to post captain for his services in the action.{{r|\"CW:52\"}} Cooke's body was [[buried at sea]] the day after the battle with the other fatal casualties from ''Bellerophon''.{{r|\"ODNB\"}}\n\n==Family and legacy==\n[[File:Tomb of Horatio Nelson on Saint-Paul Cathedral.jpg|thumb|Tribute to Cooke on left in the crypt of St Pauls Cathedral]]\n[[File:St Andrew's Church, Donhead St Andrew 16.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Memorial to Cooke in St{{nbsp}}Andrew's Church, Donhead St{{nbsp}}Andrew, in Wiltshire]]\nCooke's death, as with those of [[George Duff]] and Admiral Nelson himself, was widely mourned in Britain. Cooke's widow Louisa and their eight-year-old daughter, Louisa Charlotte, were given numerous awards and presents, including the gold medal minted for the captains who had fought at the action, and a large silver vase presented by [[Lloyd's Patriotic Fund]]. At least some of the money the family received was spent on a large wall plaque mounted in St Andrew's Church in [[Donhead St Andrew]] in [[Wiltshire]], close to the family home.{{r|\"CW:49\"}} The plaque commemorates Cooke's life and death and also that of his wife. A memorial was also raised to him in [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. Tributes from fellow officers were also forthcoming, including from the future explorer [[John Franklin]], who had served on ''Bellerophon'' at Trafalgar and had said of Cooke that he was \"very gentlemanly and active. I like his appearance very much.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}} A number of letters that Cooke wrote to his brother prior to Trafalgar are held by the [[National Maritime Museum]].{{r|\"National Archives\"}}\n\nCooke had married Louisa, n\u00e9e Hardy, on 15 June 1790 at [[St Leonard's, Shoreditch]]. Louisa was the fourth daughter of [[Josiah Hardy]], the former Governor of New Jersey, and later consul at Cadiz.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Louisa died at her home, 9 Montpellier Terrace, [[Montpellier, Cheltenham]], on 5 February 1853 aged 96.{{r|\"LC:Death\"}} The funeral was held at [[St Peter's Church, Leckhampton]], on 11 February 1853, with interment following in the churchyard.{{r|\"LC:Funeral\"}} Louisa Charlotte Cooke, their only child, was born on 26 January 1797 at [[Stoke Damerel]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Louisa Charlotte married Abraham John Newenham Devonsher of Kilshanick, County Cork, at Cheltenham, on 9 March 1820.{{r|LCC:Marriage}} She died after a short illness at St. Anne\u2019s, Albion Street, Cheltenham, on 30 April 1871 aged 74.{{r|LCC:Death}} She was interred at Bouncer's Lane Cemetery, [[Prestbury, Gloucestershire|Prestbury]], on 5 May 1871.{{r|\"LCC:Funeral\"}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{refbegin}}\n'''a.''' {{Note label|A|a|none}} A number of sources, including T. A. Heathcote's ''Nelson's Trafalgar Captains and Their Battles'', [[Colin White (historian)|Colin White's]] ''The Trafalgar Captains'' and [[John Knox Laughton|John Knox Laughton's]] entry for Cooke in the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' give a birth year of 1763 and omit most information about Cooke's early life. Nicholas Tracy's entry in ''Who's Who in Nelson's Navy'' provides fuller coverage of Cooke's early life, and includes a specific baptism date. Cooke's baptism register entry records that he was \"borne {{sic}} 17th February in 4 Tenters\".{{r|\"Baptism\"}} Tenters was then part of [[Tenterground]] at [[Spitalfields]], [[London]]. Furthermore, Cooke's father, Francis, is recorded in the 1762 [[English Land Tax|Land Tax Assessment]] Book for the Parish of Saint Mary, Whitechapel, as residing between [[Alie Street]] and [[Leman Street|Leman Street (West side)]], close to the corner of North and East Tenter streets.{{r|\"Land Tax\"}}{{r|Location of Tenterground}}.

Cooke is best known for his death in hand-to-hand combat with French forces during the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805. During the action, his ship {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} was badly damaged and boarded by sailors and marines from the French [[ship of the line]] {{Ship|French ship|Aigle|1800|2}}. Cooke was killed in the ensuing melee, but his crew successfully drove off their opponents and ultimately forced the surrender of ''Aigle''.\n\nAside from his death, remarkably little is known of Cooke's circumstances, as unlike many of his fellow officers, Cooke was never a notable society figure. He was however well respected in his profession and following his death was the subject of tributes from officers who had served alongside him. Memorials to him were placed in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and his local church in [[Wiltshire]].\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Cooke was baptised on 5 March 1762 at [[St. Mary, Whitechapel]], the second son of Francis Cooke, an [[Admiralty]] clerk, and his wife Margaret.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{Ref label|A|a|none}} John Cooke first went to sea at the age of eleven aboard the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] {{HMS|Greyhound|1763|6}} under Lieutenant [[John Bazely]], before going ashore to spend time at Mr Braken's naval academy at [[Greenwich]]. He was entered onto the books of one of the [[royal yacht]]s by [[Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport|Sir Alexander Hood]], who would become an enduring patron of Cooke's.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} In 1776 he obtained a position as a [[midshipman]] on the [[ship of the line]] {{HMS|Eagle|1774|6}}, aged thirteen.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Cooke served aboard ''Eagle'', the flagship of the [[North American Station]], during the next three years, seeing extensive action along the eastern seaboard. Notable among these actions were the naval operations around the [[Battle of Rhode Island]] in 1778, when ''Eagle'' was closely engaged with American units ashore.{{r|\"ODNB\"}} He distinguished himself in the assault, causing Admiral [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]] to remark \"Why, young man, you wish to become a Lieutenant before you are of sufficient age.\"{{r|\"NT:95\"}} On 21 January 1779, Cooke was promoted to [[lieutenant]] and joined {{HMS|Superb|1760|6}} in the East Indies under [[Edward Hughes (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Edward Hughes]], but was forced to take a leave of absence due to ill-health.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\nCooke returned to England and then went to France to spend a year studying, before rejoining the navy in 1782 with an appointment to the 90-gun {{HMS|Duke|1777|6}} under Captain [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Alan Gardner]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Cooke saw action at the [[Battle of the Saintes]], at which ''Duke'' was heavily engaged. He remained with Gardner following the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, bringing an end to the American War of Independence, and served as his first-lieutenant aboard his next command, the 50-gun {{HMS|Europa|1783|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Gardner became commodore at [[Jamaica]], flying his [[broad pennant]] aboard ''Europa'' and retaining Cooke as his first-lieutenant until Cooke was injured in a bad fall and had to be invalided home.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} He had recovered sufficiently by the time of the [[Spanish Armament]] in 1790 to be able to take up an appointment from his old patron, Sir Alexander Hood, to be third-lieutenant of his flagship, the 90-gun {{HMS|London|1766|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{r|\"ODNB\"}} When the crisis passed without breaking into open war, ''London'' was paid off and Cooke went ashore.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\n==Frigate command==\nWith the outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] in February 1793, Cooke rejoined Hood and became first-lieutenant of his new flagship, the 100-gun {{HMS|Royal George|1788|6}}, part of the [[Channel Fleet]]. On 21 February 1794, Cooke was promoted to [[commander]] and given his first independent command, the small [[fireship]] {{HMS|Incendiary|1782|6}}. Three months later, ''Incendiary'' was a signal repeater for the Channel Fleet during the [[Atlantic campaign of May 1794]], relaying [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe's]] signals to the fleet and operating as a scout in the search for the French fleet under [[Villaret de Joyeuse]]. On 1 June 1794, Cooke was a witness to the battle of the [[Glorious First of June]], although his tiny ship was far too small to engage in combat.{{r|\"JW1:126\"}} In the action's aftermath, Cooke was included in the general promotions issued to the fleet, becoming a [[post captain]] on 23 July 1794. For a year, Cooke was stationed off [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] as [[flag captain]] to [[James Wallace (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Wallace]] aboard the 74-gun {{HMS|Monarch|1765|6}}, before returning to Britain and being offered command of the 28-gun {{HMS|Tourterelle|1795|6}}.{{r|\"NT:96\"}} Cooke accepted, but when he found out she was ordered to the West Indies, he resigned it, having been told by Gardner that further service in the West Indies would likely kill him.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nInstead in early 1796 he took command of the 36-gun [[frigate]] {{HMS|Nymphe|1780|6}}. ''Nymphe'' was employed in the blockade of the French Atlantic ports over the next year, and on 9 March 1797 was in company with {{HMS|St Fiorenzo|1794|6}} when they encountered the returning ships of a short-lived [[Battle of Fishguard|French invasion attempt]] of Britain that had been defeated at [[Fishguard]] in [[Wales]].{{r|\"JW2:80\"}} The French ships attempted to escape into [[Brest, France|Brest]], but were hunted down by the British, who forced the surrender of [[French ship R\u00e9sistance|''R\u00e9sistance'']] and [[French ship Constance|''Constance'']] in turn after successive short engagements.{{r|\"JH:45\"}} Neither of the British ships suffered a single casualty in the combat, and both French ships were subsequently purchased into the Royal Navy, bringing [[prize money]] to Cooke and his crew.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=14035|page=764|date=8 August 1797}}</ref>\n\nDespite this success, Cooke was unpopular with his men due to the strict discipline he enforced aboard his ship. This was graphically demonstrated just two months after the action off Brest, when ''Nymphe'' became embroiled in the [[Spithead and Nore mutinies|Spithead mutiny]]. Cooke attempted to assist Admiral [[John Colpoys]] at the mutiny's outbreak, and was ordered ashore by his crew when he tried to return to his ship. Cooke was tactfully removed from command by the Admiralty following the mutiny, although he was returned to service two years later aboard the new frigate {{HMS|Amethyst|1799|6}} in preparation for the Anglo-Russian invasion of the [[Batavian Republic]].{{r|\"CW:48\"}} During the invasion, ''Amethyst'' conveyed the [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] to the Netherlands and later participated in the evacuation of the force following the campaign's collapse.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nCooke was involved in operations in [[Quiberon Bay]] during the remainder of 1799, and in 1800 participated in an abortive invasion of [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]]. During this time, ''Amethyst'' captured six French merchant ships and small privateers.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15301|page=1176|date=11 October 1800}}</ref> During 1801, Cooke participated in the capture of the {{Ship|French frigate|D\u00e9daigneuse|1797|2|up=yes}} off [[Cape Finisterre]], helping [[Samuel Hood Linzee]] and [[Sir Richard King, 2nd Baronet|Richard King]] chase her down on 26 January. ''Amethyst'' was not heavily engaged with ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' and received no damage, but aided in pursuing and trapping the French ship so that she could be seized. ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' was later purchased into the Royal Navy as HMS ''Dedaigneuse''.{{r|\"JW3:136\"}} Shortly afterwards, Cooke captured the Spanish ship ''Carlotta'' and the French [[privateer]] ''G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Brune'' in the same area.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15412|page=1203|date=29 September 1801}}</ref>\n\n==Trafalgar==\n[[File:Trafalgar aufstellung.jpg|thumb|Battle of Trafalgar]]\nWith the [[Peace of Amiens]], Cooke briefly retired on half-pay before being recalled to the fleet at the outbreak of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1803. Cooke was requested as flag captain by Admiral [[William Young (1751\u20131821)|Sir William Young]] at [[Plymouth]], but Cooke tactfully refused, instead applying for active service. He received command of {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} on 25 April 1805. In May, after the large combined French and Spanish fleet, under Admiral [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve]] escaped from [[Toulon]], beginning the [[Trafalgar Campaign]], Cooke was ordered to join a flying squadron under Vice-Admiral [[Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood|Cuthbert Collingwood]]. The squadron arrived off [[Cadiz]] on 9 June and Collingwood detached ''Bellerophon'' and three other ships to blockade [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] under Rear-Admiral [[Sir Richard Bickerton, 2nd Baronet|Sir Richard Bickerton]]. When the combined fleet entered Cadiz on 20 August, Collingwood recalled Bickerton's force and mounted a blockade of the port. Collingwood was reinforced with more ships, and was later superseded by Nelson. Cooke was heard to say at this time that \"To be in a general engagement with [[Horatio Nelson|Nelson]] would crown all my military ambition\".{{r|\"ODNB\"}} Nelson had Villeneuve's fleet trapped in Cadiz and was blockading the harbour awaiting their expected attempt to escape.\n\nThe Franco-Spanish fleet escaped Cadiz on 18 October 1805, but was soon chased down by Nelson and brought to battle on 21 October. Nelson formed his fleet into two divisions; the weather column would attack to the north under his direct command and the lee column would operate to the south under the command of Cuthbert Collingwood in {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|1786|6}}. Cooke was stationed fifth in Collingwood's line, and so was one of the first ships engaged in action with the combined fleet. Cooke took the unusual step of informing his first lieutenant [[William Pryce Cumby]] and his master Edward Overton of Nelson's orders, in case he should be killed.{{r|\"CW:47\"}}\n\n''Bellerophon'' was soon closely engaged with the French, breaking through the enemy line and closing with [[French ship Aigle (1800)|''Aigle'']]. As with the other French ships in the fleet, ''Aigle's'' rigging and mastheads were occupied by musketeers and grenadiers, who kept up a steady fire on ''Bellerophon'' and took a heavy toll of sailors exposed on the British ship's deck. Much of the fire was directed at the quarterdeck, where Cooke, Cumby and Overton stood. Cumby noted with surprise that Cooke was still wearing his uniform coat, which sported epaulettes that marked him out as the ship's captain to French snipers. Cooke had forgotten to remove the epaulettes and recognised the danger they represented, but replied \"It is too late to take them off. I see my situation, but I will die like a man\".{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n[[File:Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Coloured print of a naval battle between sailing ships. Four ships seen stern on in the right of the picture, obscured by clouds of smoke, a fifth ship seen bow on in the left.|''Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke'', early-nineteenth century aquatint by [[Thomas Whitcombe]], showing the ''Bellerophon'' surrounded by enemy ships at the moment of Cooke's death]]\nAs the action continued, the Captain Pierre-Paul Gour\u00e8ge of ''Aigle'' ordered his crew to board and seize ''Bellerophon'', hoping to use their superiority of numbers to overwhelm the British crew. Cooke sent Cumby below to make sure that the lower-deck guns continued to fire into the French ship as the battle continued overhead, and threw himself at the French sailors pouring onto ''Bellerophon's'' quarterdeck, shooting an enemy officer dead and engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the men behind him.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Within minutes Cumby had returned to the deck with reinforcements from below, passing the mortally wounded Overton on the ladder. The badly wounded ship's quartermaster was also present, and he informed Cumby that Cooke had fallen in the melee.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Cumby's charge cleared the French from the deck of ''Bellerophon'', and he found Cooke dead on the quarterdeck, two [[musket]] balls lodged in his chest. Cooke's last words had been \"Let me lie quietly a minute. Tell Lieutenant Cumby never to strike.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n\nCumby took charge of the battered ''Bellerophon'', directing her fire into ''Aigle'' and ultimately forcing the French ship's surrender after the arrival of other British vessels. ''Bellerophon'' had suffered grievously, losing 27 dead and 127 wounded.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Although ''Aigle'' was lost in the chaotic storm which followed the battle, ''Bellerophon'' survived, primarily due to Cumby's leadership. He was later promoted to post captain for his services in the action.{{r|\"CW:52\"}} Cooke's body was [[buried at sea]] the day after the battle with the other fatal casualties from ''Bellerophon''.{{r|\"ODNB\"}}\n\n==Family and legacy==\n[[File:Tomb of Horatio Nelson on Saint-Paul Cathedral.jpg|thumb|Tribute to Cooke on left in the crypt of St Pauls Cathedral]]\n[[File:St Andrew's Church, Donhead St Andrew 16.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Memorial to Cooke in St{{nbsp}}Andrew's Church, Donhead St{{nbsp}}Andrew, in Wiltshire]]\nCooke's death, as with those of [[George Duff]] and Admiral Nelson himself, was widely mourned in Britain. Cooke's widow Louisa and their eight-year-old daughter, Louisa Charlotte, were given numerous awards and presents, including the gold medal minted for the captains who had fought at the action, and a large silver vase presented by [[Lloyd's Patriotic Fund]]. At least some of the money the family received was spent on a large wall plaque mounted in St Andrew's Church in [[Donhead St Andrew]] in [[Wiltshire]], close to the family home.{{r|\"CW:49\"}} The plaque commemorates Cooke's life and death and also that of his wife. A memorial was also raised to him in [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. Tributes from fellow officers were also forthcoming, including from the future explorer [[John Franklin]], who had served on ''Bellerophon'' at Trafalgar and had said of Cooke that he was \"very gentlemanly and active. I like his appearance very much.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}} A number of letters that Cooke wrote to his brother prior to Trafalgar are held by the [[National Maritime Museum]].{{r|\"National Archives\"}}\n\nCooke had married Louisa, n\u00e9e Hardy, on 15 June 1790 at [[St Leonard's, Shoreditch]]. Louisa was the fourth daughter of [[Josiah Hardy]], the former Governor of New Jersey, and later consul at Cadiz.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Louisa died at her home, 9 Montpellier Terrace, [[Montpellier, Cheltenham]], on 5 February 1853 aged 96.{{r|\"LC:Death\"}} The funeral was held at [[St Peter's Church, Leckhampton]], on 11 February 1853, with interment following in the churchyard.{{r|\"LC:Funeral\"}} Louisa Charlotte Cooke, their only child, was born on 26 January 1797 at [[Stoke Damerel]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Louisa Charlotte married Abraham John Newenham Devonsher of Kilshanick, County Cork, at Cheltenham, on 9 March 1820.{{r|LCC:Marriage}} She died after a short illness at St. Anne\u2019s, Albion Street, Cheltenham, on 30 April 1871 aged 74.{{r|LCC:Death}} She was interred at Bouncers Lane Cemetery, [[Prestbury, Gloucestershire|Prestbury]], on 5 May 1871.{{r|\"LCC:Funeral\"}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{refbegin}}\n'''a.''' {{Note label|A|a|none}} A number of sources, including T. A. Heathcote's ''Nelson's Trafalgar Captains and Their Battles'', [[Colin White (historian)|Colin White's]] ''The Trafalgar Captains'' and [[John Knox Laughton|John Knox Laughton's]] entry for Cooke in the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' give a birth year of 1763 and omit most information about Cooke's early life. Nicholas Tracy's entry in ''Who's Who in Nelson's Navy'' provides fuller coverage of Cooke's early life, and includes a specific baptism date.

It is the first game in the [[Worms (series)|''Worms series'']] of video games.\n\n''Worms'' is a [[turn based]] game where a player controls a team of worms against other teams of worms that are controlled by a computer or human opponent. The aim is to use various weapons to kill the worms on the other teams and have the last surviving worm(s).\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:Worms scrapyardscreenshot.png|thumb|left|From the [[Amiga]] version: A [[scrapyard]] themed level, with the player using the [[blowtorch]] tool.]]\n''Worms'' is a turn based [[artillery game]], similar to other early games in the genre such as ''[[Scorched Earth (video game)|Scorched Earth]].\nEach player controls a team of several worms. During the course of the game, players take turns selecting one of their worms. They then use whatever tools and weapons are available to attack and kill the opponents' worms, thereby winning the game. Worms may move around the terrain in a variety of ways, normally by walking and jumping but also by using particular tools such as the \"Bungee\" and \"Ninja Rope\", to move to otherwise inaccessible areas. Each turn is time-limited to ensure that players do not hold up the game with excessive thinking or moving. The time limit can be modified in some of the games in the Worms series.\n\nOver fifty weapons and tools may be available each time a game is played, and differing selections of weapons and tools can be saved into a \"scheme\" for easy selection in future games. Other scheme settings allow options such as deployment of reinforcement crates, from which additional weapons can be obtained, and sudden death where the game is rushed to a conclusion after a time limit expires. Some settings provide for the inclusion of objects such as land mines and explosive barrels.\n\nWhen most weapons are used, they cause explosions that deform the terrain, creating circular cavities. If a worm is hit with a weapon, they will lose health. A worm who is out of health will die by blowing themselves up and leaving a grave marker. Worms can also die by being thrown off the side of the map or by falling into the water at the map's base.\n\n== Development ==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\nThe game was originally created by Andy Davidson as an entry for a [[Blitz BASIC]] programming competition run by the ''[[Amiga Format]]'' magazine, a cut-down version of the [[programming language]] having been covermounted previously. The game at this stage was called '''''Total Wormage''''' (possibly in reference to ''[[Total Carnage]]'') and it did not win the competition. Davidson sent the game to several publishers with no success. He then took the game to the [[European Computer Trade Show]], where he met with Mark Foreman \u2013 Head Games Buyer at GEM Distribution. Mark suggested to Andy that he should speak to Ocean/Team17 as they would be an ideal partner \u2013 they also had a stand at the show. Team17 made an offer on-the-spot to develop and publish the game.<ref>IGN [ Worms Blast Preview]</ref><ref>GameSpy [ Worms: Open Warfare Developer Diary]</ref>\n\nThe references to the developers' home county, [[Yorkshire]], is visible, with a soundbank named \"Tykes\", which is a Yorkshire accent, and in the \"Hell\" level found in the single player mission mode, a sign with \"Welcome to [[Ossett]]! Ha! ha! ha!\" written on it.\n\n===Character, level and sound design===\nThe game's graphics and sound design is primarily 'cartoon-like' (though less so than the later games in the series). Levels designs are randomly generated by the use of alpha-numeric strings as their [[Random seed|seeds]]. The object and landscape sets used to generate the field are arranged into 'themes' including forests, martian landscapes, beaches and 'hell'.\n\n== Release ==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\nThe North American release of the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] version was the subject of considerable negotiation, as Sony Computer Entertainment of America had a policy against 2D games being published for the console.<ref name=\"NGenPSw\"/> The [[Sega Saturn]] version of the game was a straight port of the PlayStation version.<ref name=\"SSMukSSw\"/>\n\nAn [[Atari Jaguar]] version was also developed by Team17 and published by [[Telegames]] in May 15, 1998.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Charlton|first=Frank|url=http://www.stformat.com/stf85/pages_nx1500/stf85_010.jpg|title=STF News... - Worms wriggles in|magazine=[[ST Format]]|issue=85|publisher=[[Future plc]]|date=August 1996|page=10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Jason|url=http://www.jaguarsector.com/index.php?autocom=ibwiki&cmd=article&do=print_article&id=379|title=Atari Jaguar Timeline|website=jaguarsector.com|accessdate=2018-09-13|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130629025431/http://www.jaguarsector.com/index.php?autocom=ibwiki&cmd=article&do=print_article&id=379|archivedate=29 June 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Telegames announced the release of this version after becoming the last remaining software publisher for the Jaguar and like other games published following the system's discontinuation,<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File%3AEGM_US_094.pdf&page=24|title=Tidbits...|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=94|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=May 1997|page=24}}</ref> ''Worms'' could be purchased either through [[Direct selling|direct order]] from Telegames' US and UK websites or select retailers such as [[EB Games|Electronics Boutique]].<ref>{{cite magazine|last=|first=|url=https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File:GamePro_US_105.pdf&page=22|title=News Bits|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=105|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=June 1997|page=20}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/Gamefan_Vol_5_Issue_10#page/n41|title=Recent Sightings of an Endangered Species|magazine=[[GameFan]]|volume=5|issue=10|publisher=Shinno Media|date=October 1997|page=36}}</ref> It also served as the final title released for the console to be officially licensed with the Atari name, as the rights to said name and other [[intellectual property]] rights of [[Atari Corporation]] were sold to [[Hasbro Interactive]] before [[JT Storage]]'s bankruptcy in [[1999 in video gaming|1999]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.host.fptoday.com/melek/jaguar/jag-96.htm|title=Hasbro Interactive Acquires Legendary Atari Game Property Assets|website=Nine Lives|date=March 16, 1998|accessdate=2018-12-02|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051107232949/http://www.host.fptoday.com/melek/jaguar/jag-96.htm|archivedate=7 November 2005|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Cancelled ports ===\nIn 1995, Team17 began development on a port of ''Worms'' to [[Nintendo]]'s [[Virtual Boy]] platform.<ref name=\"MMan\u00edav3i8\">{{cite magazine|author=|url=https://archive.org/stream/MicromaniaTerceraEpocaSpanishIssue8#page/n57/mode/1up|title=Reportaje: Extra\u00f1a mezcla... de gusanos - Worms|magazine=[[Microman\u00eda]]|volume=3|issue=8|publisher=HobbyPress|date=September 1995|page=58|lang=es}}</ref> The game was to be published by Ocean, but was canceled only weeks into development as a result of Nintendo's discontinuation of the console.<ref>{{cite web|last=Radke|first=Christian|url=https://www.planetvb.com/modules/games/?u030g|title=Worms|website=planetvb.com|date=2020|access-date=2020-04-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190529195248/https://www.planetvb.com/modules/games/?u030g|archive-date=2019-05-29|url-status=live}}</ref> A [[32X]] release was also planned but never released as well.<ref name=\"MMan\u00edav3i8\"/>\n\n=== Expansion pack ===\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\n''Worms Reinforcements'' ([[1996 in video gaming|1996]]) is an expansion pack for ''Worms'', which was later amalgamated with the original game to create ''Worms and Reinforcements United'' (a.k.a.

By March 1996, its sales had reached almost 250,000 copies, following its release in November 1995.<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|url=http://www.nuke.com/cgr/news/9603/worms.htm|title=Sales of Worms skyrockets|work=[[Computer Game Review]]|publisher=[[Ziff-Davis]]|date=1996|access-date=2020-04-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19961018190644/http://www.nuke.com:80/cgr/news/9603/worms.htm|archive-date=1996-10-18|url-status=live}}</ref> Across all its ports, the game ultimately sold above 5 million units by 2006.<ref name=\"RG23\">{{cite magazine|last=Day|first=Ashley|title=The Making of... Worms|magazine=[[Retro Gamer]]|issue=23|publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]]|date=March 2006|pages=26\u201329}}</ref>\n\n''Worms'' sharply divided critics. Reviewing the Saturn version, ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]'' especially praised Worms's unexpected complexity and the fun of multiplayer mode, and called it \"Quite simply the most playable game to hit the Saturn so far.\"<ref name=\"SSMukSSw\"/>\n\n''Maximum'' commented that \"Basically, ''Worms'' is ''[[Lemmings (video game)|Lemmings]]'', but it's without the puzzles and with weapons instead.\" While firmly stating that they found the game dull and unappealing, they acknowledged that it was clearly well-liked by gamers.<ref name=\"MaximumSSw\"/><ref name=\"MaximumSSw/>\n\nA ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' critic argued while the game resembles ''Lemmings'' on a cursory examination, in actuality it is much more similar to ''[[Cannon Fodder (video game)|Cannon Fodder]]''. Praising the need for both strategy and skill, the multiplayer design, and the randomly generated landscapes, he described ''Worms'' as \"the kind of game that makes no excuses for its lack of texture-mapped polygons or its minimalist gameplay. ''Worms'' is a fun game with an infectious spirit and near endless replay value.\"<ref name=\"NGenPSw\"/><ref name=\"NGenSSw\"/>\n\nCoach Kyle of ''[[GamePro]]'' summarized that \"A humorous concept never really pays off in ''Worms''.\" He criticized that the tiny size of the characters and their weapons makes them unappealing and even hard to make out. While allowing that the use of the different weapons is interesting at first, he found the action too slow-paced and repetitive to maintain interest.<ref name=\"GProSSw\"/>\n\nThe four reviewers of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' commented that \"Some games have great graphics and control, but ''Worms'' doesn't need either because the fun factor is a 10+. With multiplayer ability of up to four people, ''Worms'' is one of those games that is so unique, it doesn't fit into any category - except innovative and incredibly addictive.\"<ref name=\"EGMSSw\"/> They later named it one of their \"Top 5 Most Original Games of 1996\".<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Top 5 Most Original Games of 1996|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=91|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=February 1997|page=152}}</ref>\n\n''[[GameSpot]]'' criticized the slowness of large multiplayer sessions and the imprecision of the keyboard controls, but, like ''Sega Saturn Magazine'', they lauded the combination of surface simplicity and underlying complexity, summarizing that \"Like the board game [[Reversi|Othello]], ''Worms'' takes only a few minutes to learn, but may take a lifetime to master.\"<ref name=\"GSpotPCw\"/>\n\nConversely, the ''[[Amiga Power]]'' review, written in the style of a magazine personality quiz, whilst praising the detail of the animation, described frustrating imbalances especially in relation to the vaunted 16-player multi-player mode and was critical of the puerility of the game's humour.<ref name=\"APA500w\"/>\n\n''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' named ''Worms'' a runner-up for Strategy Game of the Year (behind ''[[Dragon Force]]'').<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The Best of '96|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |issue=92|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=March 1997|page=88}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\n''Worms'' is the first in the [[Worms (series)|''Worms series'']] of games.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{official website|http://worms.team17.com/}} ''Worms'' series\n*{{MobyGames|id=/worms|name=''Worms''}}\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08C-ttHHKFs Total Wormage trailer]\n\n{{Team17}}\n{{Virtual Boy}}\n{{Worms series}}\n{{Portal bar|1990s|United Kingdom|Video games}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Worms (1995 video game)}}\n[[Category:Worms games| 01]]\n[[Category:1995 video games]]\n[[Category:Ocean Software games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Video games with expansion packs]]\n[[Category:Games commercially released with DOSBox]]\n[[Category:Amiga games]]\n[[Category:Artillery video games]]\n[[Category:Atari Jaguar games]]\n[[Category:Cancelled Sega 32X games]]\n[[Category:Cancelled Virtual Boy games]]\n[[Category:CD32 games]]\n[[Category:DOS games]]\n[[Category:Game Boy games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation (console) games]]\n[[Category:Sega Genesis games]]\n[[Category:Sega Saturn games]]\n[[Category:Strategy video games]]\n[[Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System games]]\n[[Category:Team17]]\n[[Category:Telegames games]]\n[[Category:Video games scored by Allister Brimble]]\n", "text_old": "{{About||the 2007 game|Worms (2007 video game)|the 1983 game|Worms?}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{under construction|placedby=KGRAMR|nosection=yes}}\n{{in use}}\n{{Infobox video game\n| title        = Worms\n| image        = Worms-win-cover.jpg\n| image_size   = 256px\n| caption      = \n| developer    = [[Team17]]\n| publisher    = [[Ocean Software]]\n| designer     = [[Andy Davidson (game designer)|Andy Davidson]]\n|composer      = [[Bj\u00f8rn Lynne]]\n| series       = ''[[Worms (series)|Worms]]''\n| engine       = \n| released     = '''Amiga, CD32, Game Boy & Mac'''<br />{{vgrelease|EU|1995<ref>{{MobyGames|id=/worms|name=''Worms''}}</ref><ref>[http://amr.abime.net/review_10209 Worms review from CU Amiga Magazine (Dec 1995) \u2013 Amiga Magazine Rack] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220093731/http://amr.abime.net/review_10209 |date=2012-02-20 }}</ref>}}'''Mega Drive'''<br />{{vgrelease|EU|June 1, 1995}}'''PC (DOS)'''<br />{{Video game release|NA|October 31, 1995 (Retail)|EU|1995|NA|October 19, 2011 (Steam)}}'''PlayStation'''<br />{{Video game release|NA|1996|EU|November, 1995<ref name=\"CTW565\">{{cite magazine |title=Christmas Games Guide |magazine=Computer Trade Weekly |location=United Kingdom |date=27 November 1995 |issue=565 |page=43 }}</ref>|JP|February 28, 1997}}'''SNES'''<br />{{vgrelease|EU|September 29, 1996}}'''Saturn'''<br />{{Video game release|NA|1996|EU|1995|JP|March 14, 1997}}'''Jaguar'''<br />{{vgrelease|NA|May 15, 1998}}\n| genre        = [[Artillery game|Artillery]], [[Strategy video game|Strategy]]\n| modes        = [[Single-player]], [[multiplayer]]\n| platforms    = [[Amiga]], [[Amiga CD32]], [[Game Boy]], [[Sega Genesis]], [[Atari Jaguar]], [[Mac OS]], [[IBM PC compatible]] ([[MS-DOS]]), [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], [[Sega Saturn]], [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]]\n}}\n'''''Worms''''' is a 2D [[Artillery game|artillery]] [[Strategy video game|tactical]] video game developed by [[Team17]] and released in [[1995 in video gaming|1995]]. It is the first game in the [[Worms (series)|''Worms series'']] of video games.\n\n''Worms'' is a [[turn based]] game where a player controls a team of worms against other teams of worms that are controlled by a computer or human opponent. The aim is to use various weapons to kill the worms on the other teams and have the last surviving worm(s).\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:Worms scrapyardscreenshot.png|thumb|left|From the [[Amiga]] version: A [[scrapyard]] themed level, with the player using the [[blowtorch]] tool.]]\n''Worms'' is a turn based [[artillery game]], similar to other early games in the genre such as ''[[Scorched Earth (video game)|Scorched Earth]].\nEach player controls a team of several worms. During the course of the game, players take turns selecting one of their worms. They then use whatever tools and weapons are available to attack and kill the opponents' worms, thereby winning the game. Worms may move around the terrain in a variety of ways, normally by walking and jumping but also by using particular tools such as the \"Bungee\" and \"Ninja Rope\", to move to otherwise inaccessible areas. Each turn is time-limited to ensure that players do not hold up the game with excessive thinking or moving. The time limit can be modified in some of the games in the Worms series.\n\nOver fifty weapons and tools may be available each time a game is played, and differing selections of weapons and tools can be saved into a \"scheme\" for easy selection in future games. Other scheme settings allow options such as deployment of reinforcement crates, from which additional weapons can be obtained, and sudden death where the game is rushed to a conclusion after a time limit expires. Some settings provide for the inclusion of objects such as land mines and explosive barrels.\n\nWhen most weapons are used, they cause explosions that deform the terrain, creating circular cavities. If a worm is hit with a weapon, they will lose health. A worm who is out of health will die by blowing themselves up and leaving a grave marker. Worms can also die by being thrown off the side of the map or by falling into the water at the map's base.\n\n== Development ==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\nThe game was originally created by Andy Davidson as an entry for a [[Blitz BASIC]] programming competition run by the ''[[Amiga Format]]'' magazine, a cut-down version of the [[programming language]] having been covermounted previously. The game at this stage was called '''''Total Wormage''''' (possibly in reference to ''[[Total Carnage]]'') and it did not win the competition. Davidson sent the game to several publishers with no success. He then took the game to the [[European Computer Trade Show]], where he met with Mark Foreman \u2013 Head Games Buyer at GEM Distribution. Mark suggested to Andy that he should speak to Ocean/Team17 as they would be an ideal partner \u2013 they also had a stand at the show. Team17 made an offer on-the-spot to develop and publish the game.<ref>IGN [ Worms Blast Preview]</ref><ref>GameSpy [ Worms: Open Warfare Developer Diary]</ref>\n\nThe references to the developers' home county, [[Yorkshire]], is visible, with a soundbank named \"Tykes\", which is a Yorkshire accent, and in the \"Hell\" level found in the single player mission mode, a sign with \"Welcome to [[Ossett]]! Ha! ha! ha!\" written on it.\n===Character, level and sound design===\nThe game's graphics and sound design is primarily 'cartoon-like' (though less so than the later games in the series). Levels designs are randomly generated by the use of alpha-numeric strings as their [[Random seed|seeds]]. The object and landscape sets used to generate the field are arranged into 'themes' including forests, martian landscapes, beaches and 'hell'.\n\n== Release ==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\nThe North American release of the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] version was the subject of considerable negotiation, as Sony Computer Entertainment of America had a policy against 2D games being published for the console.<ref name=\"NGenPSw\"/> The [[Sega Saturn]] version of the game was a straight port of the PlayStation version.<ref name=\"SSMukSSw\"/>\n\nAn [[Atari Jaguar]] version was also developed by Team17 and published by [[Telegames]] in May 15, 1998.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Charlton|first=Frank|url=http://www.stformat.com/stf85/pages_nx1500/stf85_010.jpg|title=STF News... - Worms wriggles in|magazine=[[ST Format]]|issue=85|publisher=[[Future plc]]|date=August 1996|page=10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Jason|url=http://www.jaguarsector.com/index.php?autocom=ibwiki&cmd=article&do=print_article&id=379|title=Atari Jaguar Timeline|website=jaguarsector.com|accessdate=2018-09-13|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130629025431/http://www.jaguarsector.com/index.php?autocom=ibwiki&cmd=article&do=print_article&id=379|archivedate=29 June 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Telegames announced the release of this version after becoming the last remaining software publisher for the Jaguar and like other games published following the system's discontinuation,<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File%3AEGM_US_094.pdf&page=24|title=Tidbits...|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=94|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=May 1997|page=24}}</ref> ''Worms'' could be purchased either through [[Direct selling|direct order]] from Telegames' US and UK websites or select retailers such as [[EB Games|Electronics Boutique]].<ref>{{cite magazine|last=|first=|url=https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File:GamePro_US_105.pdf&page=22|title=News Bits|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=105|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=June 1997|page=20}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/Gamefan_Vol_5_Issue_10#page/n41|title=Recent Sightings of an Endangered Species|magazine=[[GameFan]]|volume=5|issue=10|publisher=Shinno Media|date=October 1997|page=36}}</ref> It also served as the final title released for the console to be officially licensed with the Atari name, as the rights to said name and other [[intellectual property]] rights of [[Atari Corporation]] were sold to [[Hasbro Interactive]] before [[JT Storage]]'s bankruptcy in [[1999 in video gaming|1999]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.host.fptoday.com/melek/jaguar/jag-96.htm|title=Hasbro Interactive Acquires Legendary Atari Game Property Assets|website=Nine Lives|date=March 16, 1998|accessdate=2018-12-02|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051107232949/http://www.host.fptoday.com/melek/jaguar/jag-96.htm|archivedate=7 November 2005|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Cancelled ports ===\nIn 1995, Team17 began development on a port of ''Worms'' to [[Nintendo]]'s [[Virtual Boy]] platform.<ref name=\"MMan\u00edav3i8\">{{cite magazine|author=|url=https://archive.org/stream/MicromaniaTerceraEpocaSpanishIssue8#page/n57/mode/1up|title=Reportaje: Extra\u00f1a mezcla... de gusanos - Worms|magazine=[[Microman\u00eda]]|volume=3|issue=8|publisher=HobbyPress|date=September 1995|page=58|lang=es}}</ref> The game was to be published by Ocean, but was canceled only weeks into development as a result of Nintendo's discontinuation of the console.<ref>{{cite web|last=Radke|first=Christian|url=https://www.planetvb.com/modules/games/?u030g|title=Worms|website=planetvb.com|date=2020|access-date=2020-04-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190529195248/https://www.planetvb.com/modules/games/?u030g|archive-date=2019-05-29|url-status=live}}</ref> A [[32X]] release was also planned but never released as well.<ref name=\"MMan\u00edav3i8\"/>\n\n=== Expansion pack ===\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\n''Worms Reinforcements'' ([[1996 in video gaming|1996]]) is an expansion pack for ''Worms'', which was later amalgamated with the original game to create ''Worms and Reinforcements United'' (a.k.a.

Reviewing the Saturn version, ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]'' especially praised Worms's unexpected complexity and the fun of multiplayer mode, and called it \"Quite simply the most playable game to hit the Saturn so far.\"<ref name=\"SSMukSSw\"/>\n\n''Maximum'' commented that \"Basically, ''Worms'' is ''[[Lemmings (video game)|Lemmings]]'', but it's without the puzzles and with weapons instead.\" While firmly stating that they found the game dull and unappealing, they acknowledged that it was clearly well-liked by gamers.<ref name=\"MaximumSSw\"/><ref name=\"MaximumSSw/>\n\nA ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' critic argued while the game resembles ''Lemmings'' on a cursory examination, in actuality it is much more similar to ''[[Cannon Fodder (video game)|Cannon Fodder]]''. Praising the need for both strategy and skill, the multiplayer design, and the randomly generated landscapes, he described ''Worms'' as \"the kind of game that makes no excuses for its lack of texture-mapped polygons or its minimalist gameplay. ''Worms'' is a fun game with an infectious spirit and near endless replay value.\"<ref name=\"NGenPSw\"/><ref name=\"NGenSSw\"/>\n\nCoach Kyle of ''[[GamePro]]'' summarized that \"A humorous concept never really pays off in ''Worms''.\" He criticized that the tiny size of the characters and their weapons makes them unappealing and even hard to make out. While allowing that the use of the different weapons is interesting at first, he found the action too slow-paced and repetitive to maintain interest.<ref name=\"GProSSw\"/>\n\nThe four reviewers of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' commented that \"Some games have great graphics and control, but ''Worms'' doesn't need either because the fun factor is a 10+. With multiplayer ability of up to four people, ''Worms'' is one of those games that is so unique, it doesn't fit into any category - except innovative and incredibly addictive.\"<ref name=\"EGMSSw\"/> They later named it one of their \"Top 5 Most Original Games of 1996\".<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Top 5 Most Original Games of 1996|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=91|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=February 1997|page=152}}</ref>\n\n''[[GameSpot]]'' criticized the slowness of large multiplayer sessions and the imprecision of the keyboard controls, but, like ''Sega Saturn Magazine'', they lauded the combination of surface simplicity and underlying complexity, summarizing that \"Like the board game [[Reversi|Othello]], ''Worms'' takes only a few minutes to learn, but may take a lifetime to master.\"<ref name=\"GSpotPCw\"/>\n\nConversely, the ''[[Amiga Power]]'' review, written in the style of a magazine personality quiz, whilst praising the detail of the animation, described frustrating imbalances especially in relation to the vaunted 16-player multi-player mode and was critical of the puerility of the game's humour.<ref name=\"APA500w\"/>\n\n''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' named ''Worms'' a runner-up for Strategy Game of the Year (behind ''[[Dragon Force]]'').<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The Best of '96|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |issue=92|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=March 1997|page=88}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\n''Worms'' is the first in the [[Worms (series)|''Worms series'']] of games.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{official website|http://worms.team17.com/}} ''Worms'' series\n*{{MobyGames|id=/worms|name=''Worms''}}\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08C-ttHHKFs Total Wormage trailer]\n\n{{Team17}}\n{{Virtual Boy}}\n{{Worms series}}\n{{Portal bar|1990s|United Kingdom|Video games}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Worms (1995 video game)}}\n[[Category:Worms games| 01]]\n[[Category:1995 video games]]\n[[Category:Ocean Software games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Video games with expansion packs]]\n[[Category:Games commercially released with DOSBox]]\n[[Category:Amiga games]]\n[[Category:Artillery video games]]\n[[Category:Atari Jaguar games]]\n[[Category:Cancelled Sega 32X games]]\n[[Category:Cancelled Virtual Boy games]]\n[[Category:CD32 games]]\n[[Category:DOS games]]\n[[Category:Game Boy games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation (console) games]]\n[[Category:Sega Genesis games]]\n[[Category:Sega Saturn games]]\n[[Category:Strategy video games]]\n[[Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System games]]\n[[Category:Team17]]\n[[Category:Telegames games]]\n[[Category:Video games scored by Allister Brimble]]\n", "name_user": "KGRAMR", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDevelopment", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worms_(1995_video_game)"}

From left to right: Anne, Emily and Charlotte. (Branwell used to be between Emily and Charlotte, but subsequently painted himself out.)]]\n\nEmily Bront\u00eb was born on 30 July 1818 to [[Maria Branwell]] and an Irish father, [[Patrick Bront\u00eb]].  The family was living on Market Street in the village of [[Thornton, West Yorkshire|Thornton]] on the outskirts of [[Bradford]], in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]], [[Northern England]].  Emily's older siblings included, eldest to youngest, Maria, Elizabeth, [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb|Charlotte]] and [[Branwell Bront\u00eb|Branwell]], making Emily the Bront\u00ebs' fifth child.  In 1820, Emily's younger sister [[Anne Bront\u00eb|Anne]], the last Bront\u00eb child, was born. Shortly thereafter, the family moved eight miles away to [[Haworth]], where Patrick was employed as [[perpetual curate]],<ref name=\"Fraser 16\" />  In Haworth, the children would have opportunities to develop their literary talents.<ref name=\"Fraser 16\">Fraser, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', p. 16</ref>\n\nWhen Emily was only three, and all six children under the age of eight, she and her siblings lost their mother, Maria, to cancer on 15 September 1821.<ref name=\"Fraser 28\">Fraser, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', p. 28</ref> The younger children were to be cared for by [[Elizabeth Branwell]], their aunt and mother Maria's sister. \n\nEmily's three elder sisters, [[Maria Bront\u00eb|Maria]], Elizabeth, and Charlotte, were sent to the [[Cowan Bridge School|Clergy Daughters' School]] at Cowan Bridge. At the age of six, on 25 November 1824, Emily joined her sisters at school for a brief period.<ref name=\"Fraser 35\">Fraser, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', p. 35</ref>  At school, however, the children suffered abuse and privations, and when a [[typhoid]] epidemic swept the school, Maria and Elizabeth became ill. Maria, who may actually have had [[tuberculosis]], was sent home, where she died. Emily, Charlotte and Elizabeth were subsequently removed from the school in June 1825. Elizabeth died soon after their return home. \n\nThe four youngest Bront\u00eb children, all under ten years of age, had suffered the loss of the three eldest females in their immediate family.<ref name=\" Fraser 31\">Fraser, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', p. 31</ref>\n\nCharlotte maintained that the school's poor conditions permanently affected her health and physical development and that it had hastened the deaths of Maria (born 1814) and Elizabeth (born 1815), who both died in 1825. After the deaths of his older daughters, Patrick removed Charlotte and Emily from the school.{{sfn|Fraser|2008|p=261}} Charlotte would use her experiences and knowledge of the school as the basis for Lowood School in ''[[Jane Eyre]]''.\n\nThe three remaining sisters and their brother [[Branwell Bront\u00eb|Branwell]] were thereafter educated at home by their father and aunt [[Elizabeth Branwell]]. A shy girl, Emily was very close to her siblings and was known as a great animal lover, especially for befriending stray dogs she found wandering around the countryside.<ref>Paddock & Rollyson ''The  Bront\u00ebs A to Z''  p. 20.</ref> Despite the lack of formal education, Emily and her siblings had access to a wide range of published material; favourites included [[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott]], [[Lord Byron|Byron]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]], and ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]''.<ref name=\"Fraser 44-45\">Fraser, ''The Bront\u00ebs'', pp. 44\u201345</ref>\n\n[[File:Gondal Poems.jpg|thumb|179 px|Emily's [[Gondal (fictional country)|Gondal]] poems]]\n\nInspired by a box of toy soldiers Branwell had received as a gift, <ref>Richard E.

With the exception of their Gondal poems and Anne's lists of Gondal's characters and place-names, Emily and Anne's Gondal writings were largely not preserved. Among those that did survive are some \"diary papers,\" written by Emily in her twenties, which describe current events in Gondal.<ref>[http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/english/melani/novel_19c/wuthering/diary_papers#diary \"Emily Bront\u00eb's Letters and Diary Papers\"], City University of New York</ref> The heroes of Gondal tended to resemble the popular image of the Scottish Highlander, a sort of British version of the \"noble savage\": romantic outlaws capable of more nobility, passion, and bravery than the denizens of \"civilization\".{{sfn|Austin|p=578}} Similar themes of romanticism and noble savagery are apparent across the Bront\u00eb's juvenilia, notably in Branwell's ''The Life of Alexander Percy'', which tells the story of an all-consuming, death-defying, and ultimately self-destructive love and is generally considered an inspiration for ''Wuthering Heights''.<ref name=\"Paddock p. 199\">Paddock & Rollyson ''The  Bront\u00ebs A to Z''  p. 199.</ref>\n\nAt seventeen, Emily began to attend the Roe Head Girls' School, where Charlotte was a teacher, but suffered from extreme [[homesickness]] and left after only a few months. Charlotte wrote later that \"Liberty was the breath of Emily's nostrils; without it, she perished. The change from her own home to a school and from her own very noiseless, very secluded but unrestricted and unartificial mode of life, to one of disciplined routine (though under the kindest auspices), was what she failed in enduring...

Unlike Charlotte, Emily was uncomfortable in Brussels, and refused to adopt Belgian fashions, saying \"I wish to be as God made me\", which rendered her  something of an outcast.<ref>Paddock & Rollyson ''The  Bront\u00ebs A to Z''  p. 21.</ref> Nine of Emily's French essays survive from this period. H\u00e9ger seems to have been impressed with the strength of Emily's character, writing that:\n<blockquote><div>\nShe should have been a man \u2013 a great navigator. Her powerful reason would have deduced new spheres of discovery from the knowledge of the old; and her strong imperious will would never have been daunted by opposition or difficulty, never have given way but with life. She had a head for logic, and a capability of argument unusual in a man and rarer indeed in a woman... impairing this gift was her stubborn tenacity of will which rendered her obtuse to all reasoning where her own wishes, or her own sense of right, was concerned.<ref>[[Constantin H\u00e9ger]], 1842, referring to Emily Bront\u00eb, as quoted in ''The Oxford History of the Novel in English'' (2011), Volume 3, p. 208</ref>\n</div></blockquote>\nThe two sisters were committed to their studies and by the end of the term had become so competent in French that Madame H\u00e9ger proposed that they both stay another half-year, even, according to Charlotte, offering to dismiss the English master so that she could take his place. Emily had, by this time, become a competent pianist and teacher and it was suggested that she might stay on to teach music.<ref>{{cite book|author=Norma Crandall|title=Emily Bront\u00eb, a Psychological Portrait|publisher=R.

One was labelled \"Gondal Poems\"; the other was unlabelled.

Emily, furious at the invasion of her privacy, at first refused but relented when Anne brought out her own manuscripts and revealed to Charlotte that she had been writing poems in secret as well.

Emily\u2019s heart was won by the unresisting endurance of the visitor, little guessing that she herself, being in close contact, was the inspiring cause of submission to Keeper\u2019s preference. Sometimes Emily would delight in showing off Keeper\u2014make him frantic in action, and roar with the voice of a lion. It was a terrifying exhibition within the walls of an ordinary sitting-room.
