The city is close to winter skiing centres in the north and to seaside resorts on the [[Adriatic Sea]].\n\n[[Podgorica Municipality]] covers 10.4% of Montenegro's territory and is home to 29.9% of the country's population. It is the nation's administrative centre and its economic, cultural, and educational focus.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Podgorica'' means \"[area] below Gorica\". Gorica, meaning \"little hill\", is the name of one of the [[cypress]]-covered [[hillock]]s that overlook the city centre.\n\nSome three kilometres ({{convert|3|km|abbr=off|disp=output only}}) north-west of Podgorica lie the ruins of the Roman-era town of [[Doclea (town)|Doclea]], from which the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Diocletian]] hailed. In later centuries, Romans \"corrected\" the name to {{lang|la|Dioclea}}, guessing wrongly that an ''i'' had been lost in vulgar speech. {{lang|zls|Duklja}} is the later [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] version of that word.\n\nAt its foundation (some time before the 11th century), the town was called '''Birziminium'''. In the [[Middle Ages]], it was known as '''Ribnica''' (Montenegrin Cyrillic: {{lang|sh|\u0420\u0438\u0431\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430}} {{IPA-sh|r\u00eebnitsa|}}). The name Podgorica was used from 1326. From 1946 to 1992, the city was [[List of places named after Tito|named]] '''Titograd''' in honour of [[Josip Broz Tito]], the former [[President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|President of Yugoslavia]].\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\n[[File:Doclea Roman city Podgorica.jpg|thumb|left|[[Doclea (town)|Doclea]], Roman town, the seat of the Late Roman province of [[Praevalitana]].]]\n[[File:Ancient city Doclea - ruins 06.jpg|thumb|right|190px|Archeological remains of the Roman period in Doclea.]]\nPodgorica is at the [[Crossroads (culture)|crossroads]] of several historically important routes, near the rivers [[Zeta River|Zeta]], [[Mora\u010da]], [[Cijevna]], [[Ribnica (river)|Ribnica]], [[Sitnica (Mora\u010da)|Sitnica]] and [[Mareza]] in the valley of [[Lake Skadar]] and near the Adriatic Sea, in fertile lowlands with favourable climate. The earliest human settlements were in prehistory: the oldest physical remains are from the late [[Stone Age]].\n\nIn the [[Iron Age]], the area between the [[Zeta plain|Zeta]] and [[Bjelopavli\u0107i plain|Bjelopavli\u0107i valleys]] was occupied by two Illyrian tribes, the [[Labeates]] and the [[Docleatae]]. The population of the town of Doclea was 8,000\u201310,000, in which all core urban issues were resolved. The high population density (in an area of about {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} radius) was made possible by the geographical position, favourable climate and economic conditions and by the defensive positions that were of great importance at that time.\n\n===Middle Ages===\nFrom the 5th century AD, with the arrival of the first [[Sclaveni|Slavic]] and [[Pannonian Avars|Avar]] tribes and the beginning of the break-up of the [[Roman Empire]], the area bore witness to many noteworthy events. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} With time, the fortifications ceased their function and new towns were built; a new settlement probably named after the Ribnica river, on whose banks it was built, Ribnica, was established. It was first mentioned during the reign of the [[Nemanji\u0107 dynasty]], as part of the [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Serbian kingdom]]. The importance of Ribnica was its position as crossroads in communications with the west. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe name Podgorica was first mentioned in 1326 in a court document of the [[Kotor]] archives. The city was economically strong: trade routes between the [[Republic of Ragusa]] and Serbia, well developed at that time, were maintained via the road that led to Podgorica through [[Trebinje]] and [[Nik\u0161i\u0107]]. As a busy crossroad, Podgorica was a vibrant regional centre of trade and communication. This boosted its development, economic power, military strength and strategic importance. {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n===Ottoman Empire===\n[[File:28iulsah.jpg|thumb|View of [[Depedogen|Ribnica fortress and Old bridge]], Catholic Church (right), Debbaglar Bridge, government mansion and the Mirko Varosh Hotel (far left), before 1901.]]\n[[File:Sahat-kula in Podgorica.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[Clock Tower (Podgorica)|City Clock Tower]].]]\nThe [[Ottoman Empire]] captured Podgorica in 1474.

The area is crossed with rivers and the city itself is only {{convert|15|km}} north of [[Lake Skadar]]. The [[Mora\u010da River|Mora\u010da]] and [[Ribnica River|Ribnica]] rivers flow through the city, while the [[Zeta River|Zeta]], [[Cijevna River|Cijevna]], [[Sitnica River|Sitnica]] and [[Mareza]] flow nearby. ''Mora\u010da'' is the largest river in the city, being {{convert|70|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}} wide near downtown, and having carved a {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}} deep canyon for the length of its course through the city. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} Except for the Mora\u010da and Zeta, other rivers have an appearance of small creeks. The richness in bodies of water is a major feature of the city.\n\nIn contrast to most of Montenegro, Podgorica lies in a mainly flat area at the northern end of the Zeta plain, at an elevation of {{convert|40|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The only exceptions are hills which overlook the city. The most significant is {{convert|130.3|m|ft|abbr=on}} high '''Gorica Hill''' ({{IPA-sh|\u02c8\u0261\u01d2rit\u035csa|pron}}), city's namesake, which rises above the city centre. The other hills include ''Malo brdo'' (\"little hill\", {{convert|205.4|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}), ''Velje brdo'' (\"big hill\", {{convert|283|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}), ''Ljubovi\u0107'' ({{convert|101|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and ''Dajbapska gora'' ({{convert|172|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}). For the most part, these are too steep for development and thus limit the city's expansion, especially to the north. However, urbanization has been encroaching on the lower slopes of the hills since the 1990s. \nPodgorica city proper has an area of {{convert|108|km2|sqmi}}, while actual urbanized area is much smaller.\n\n<gallery>\nPodgorica,_Montenegro_-_panoramio_(14).jpg|[[Mora\u010da]] river canyon.\nLago Skadar, Montenegro, 2014-04-14, DD 01.JPG|[[Lake Skadar]]\nNijagara_-_panoramio.jpg|River Cijevna waterfalls near Podgorica\nZagoric.JPG|Podgorica panoramic view.\n</gallery>\n\n===Climate===\n[[File:Podgorica, piazza repubblica.JPG|thumb|right|180px|[[Republic Square (Podgorica)|Independence Square]].]]\nUnder the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], Podgorica has a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa'' instead of ''Csa''), since there is only one summer month with less than {{convert|40|mm|in|sp=us}} of precipitation,<ref name=Peel>{{cite journal | author=Peel, M.

This part of the city is today traditionally regarded as city centre, and is called ''Nova Varo\u0161'' (''New town'')\n\nDuring World War II, Podgorica was almost razed to the ground, being [[Bombing of Podgorica in World War II|bombed over 70 times]]. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} After liberation, rebuilding began as in other cities of the communist-ruled SFRY.

Although not as rich in museums and galleries as the historic royal capital [[Cetinje]], there are several noteworthy museums:\n\n[[File:Novi_Grad,_Podgorica,_Montenegro_-_panoramio_(9).jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ, Podgorica|Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ]] interior.]]\n[[File:Royal Garden in Podgorica.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Former residence of King Nikola I Petrovi\u0107, today an art gallery.]]\n[[File:Crnogorsko Narodno Pozori\u0161te.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Montenegrin National Theatre]]]]\n[[File:Podgorica, museo nazionale, esterno 01.JPG|thumb|left|200px|{{nowrap|National Museum of Montenegro}}]]\n* The Podgorica City Museum (''Muzej grada Podgorice'') preserves Podgorica's rich heritage. Founded in 1950, it has four categories: archaeological, ethnographic, historical and cultural-historical. It houses artefacts which date back to the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Illyria]]n eras. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n* The Archaeological Research Centre (''Centar za arheolo\u0161ka istra\u017eivanja'') was founded in 1961. Its mission is to gather, classify, restore and display archaeological sites.\n* The [[Marko Miljanov]] Museum (''Muzej Marka Miljanova'') in [[Medun]] shows life in 19th century Montenegro. \n* The Natural History Museum (''Prirodnja\u010dki muzej'') displays specimens of Montenegrin flora and fauna. This museum has no exhibition space of its own, despite many proposals and initiatives to build one. {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\nThere is a notable art gallery in the ''Dvorac'' [[House of Petrovi\u0107|''Petrovi\u0107a'']] ([[Podgorica Royal Palace|Petrovi\u0107 Castle]]) complex in Podgorica's largest public park. [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|King Nicholas]]'s castle, ''Perjani\u010dki Dom'' (House of the Honour Guard), castle chapel and surrounding buildings were converted to an art gallery in 1984. Since 1995, it has been part of the Modern Arts Centre (''Centar savremenih umjetnosti'') and houses approximately 1,500 works of art. The historic Cinema of Culture (''Kino Kultura''), which was founded in 1949, was closed in November 2008 due to continuous financial losses it generated. It was the only cinema in the city for 6 decades. The building of the former cinema will be converted to host the Podgorica City Theatre. Shortly after its closure, a [[Ster-Kinekor]] (later acquired by [[Cineplexx Cinemas|Cineplexx]]) 6-screen [[Multiplex (movie theater)|multiplex]] cinema opened at [[Delta City]] shopping mall.\n\nA significant cultural institution of over fifty years' standing is the Budo Tomovi\u0107 Cultural-Informational Centre (''KIC Budo Tomovi\u0107''). It is a public institution which organizes various artistic events, including Podgorica Cultural Summer (''Podgori\u010dko Kulturno Ljeto''), FIAT \u2013 International Alternative Theatre Festival (''Festival Internacionalnog Alternativnog Teatra''), DEUS \u2013 December Arts Scene (''Decembarska Umjetni\u010dka Scena'').\n\n==Media==\nPodgorica is the media hub of Montenegro. It is home to the headquarters of the state-owned [[public television]] broadcaster [[RTCG]]. Commercial broadcasters in Podgorica include [[RTV A1]], [[TV Vijesti]], [[Nova M]] and [[Prva TV]]. It was announced that the city's local television will be launched soon.<ref>[http://www.cgvijesti.net/209191_Mugosa-Podgorica-dobija-svoju-televiziju.html Mugo\u0161a: Podgorica dobija svoju televiziju] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723040909/http://www.cgvijesti.net/209191_Mugosa-Podgorica-dobija-svoju-televiziju.html |date=23 July 2011 }}</ref> Their programmes can be received in much of Montenegro.\n\nAll Montenegro's daily newspapers (oldest Montenegrin daily newspaper ''[[Pobjeda]]'', ''[[Vijesti]]'', ''[[Dnevne Novine]]'' and ''[[Dan (newspaper)|Dan]]'') are published in Podgorica, as the weekly magazines ''[[The Monitor (Montenegro)|Monitor]]'' and ''[[Magazin BIT]]''.\n\n==Sports==\n[[File:Novi_Grad,_Podgorica,_Montenegro_-_panoramio_(34).jpg|thumb|right|[[Mora\u010da Sports Center]].]]\nThe most popular sports by far are [[association football|football]] and [[basketball]]. Basketball became especially popular with the success in the late 20th and early 21st centuries of [[KK Budu\u0107nost Podgorica|KK Budu\u0107nost]], both in [[ABA League|Regional]] and European competitions.\n\nFootball in Podgorica has a long tradition associated with [[FK Budu\u0107nost Podgorica|Budu\u0107nost]]. World-famous players [[Predrag Mijatovi\u0107]] and [[Dejan Savi\u0107evi\u0107]] were born in Podgorica and made their debut in that team. The club [[FK Zeta]] from the Podgorica suburb of [[Golubovci]] has also reached the former first league of Serbia and Montenegro. These clubs, along with [[FK Sutjeska Nik\u0161i\u0107|Sutjeska]] from Nik\u0161i\u0107, usually compete with each other for leading position in the [[First League of Montenegro]].\nOther clubs from Podgorica and its surroundings play in the Montenegrin First League e.g. [[OFK Titograd]] & [[FK Kom|Kom]]. One of the most popular clubs from the suburbs is [[FK Ribnica]] from [[Konik, Montenegro|Konik]], [[FK Zabjelo]] from [[Zabjelo]] and [[OFK Mladost Lje\u0161kopolje|OFK Mladost 1970]] from ''Donja Gorica''.\n\nThe volleyball team [[OK Budu\u0107nost Podgorica|OK Budu\u0107nost]] and the women's handball team [[\u017dRK Budu\u0107nost T-Mobile]] have had significant success in European competition. [[Budu\u0107nost Podgorica]] is the most important sports club in Podgorica. Its name means ''Future''.\n\n[[Chess]] is another popular sport and some famous global chess players, like [[Slavko Dedi\u0107]], are born in Podgorica.\n\nSporting events like the annual [[Podgorica Marathon]] and the ''Mora\u010da River'' jumps attract international competitors.\nPodgorica was the host of [[2009 FINA Men's Water Polo World League]].\n\n===Venues===\n[[File:PodgoricaCityStadium2017.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Podgorica City Stadium]]]]\nPodgorica has a number of sporting venues; some are under reconstruction and expansion. The main ones are:\n*[[Podgorica City Stadium]]. It has a capacity of 11,264 and it is the home of [[FK Budu\u0107nost Podgorica]] and the [[Montenegro national football team]]. It is currently the only venue in Montenegro that complies with [[FIFA]] standards for international football matches.\n*[[Mora\u010da Sports Center]], a multi functional indoor sport facility. It has a capacity of 6 000 seats. It hosted one group of [[EuroBasket 2005]], while other games were played in [[Belgrade Arena|Belgrade]], [[Millennium Centar|Vr\u0161ac]], and [[Spens Sports Center|Novi Sad]].\n\nAlmost every football club in Podgorica has its own stadium, although these are often only fields with small stands or no stands at all.\nOther notable venues are the [[Stadion malih sportova]] under Gorica hill and the [[sport shooting]] range under Ljubovi\u0107 hill. There are many other sports facilities around the city, most notably [[indoor soccer]] fields.\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Podgorica_National_bank_of_Montenegro.JPG|thumb|left|Central Bank of Montenegro.]]\n[[File:Podgorica-Tuzi plantaze wineyard IMG 1318 Cijevna river.JPG|thumb|right|Aerial view of the [[Planta\u017ee]] wineyard, this wine field is the largest single one in Europe.]]\nPodgorica is not only the administrative centre of Montenegro, but also its main economic engine. Most of Montenegro's industrial, financial, and commercial base is in Podgorica. {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nBefore World War I, most of Podgorica's economy was in trade and small-scale manufacture, which was an economic model established during the long rule of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} After World War II, Podgorica became Montenegro's capital and a focus of the rapid urbanization and industrialization of the SFRY era. Industries such as aluminium and tobacco processing, [[textile industry|textiles]], engineering, vehicle production, and wine production were established in and around the city. In 1981, Podgorica's GDP per capita was 87% of the Yugoslav average.<ref>{{cite book | title=Atlas svijeta: Novi pogled na Zemlju | year=1984 | edition=3rd | publisher=Sveu\u010dili\u0161na naklada Liber | location=Zagreb | language=Croatian | editor1-first=Radovan | editor1-last=Radovinovi\u0107 | editor2-first=Ivan | editor2-last=Berti\u0107}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1990s, the [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|dissolution of Yugoslavia]], [[Yugoslav wars]], and the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 757|UN-imposed sanctions]] left Podgorica's industries without traditional markets, suppliers, and available funds. This, combined with typical [[Transition economy|transition]] pressures, led to a decline of the industrial base, where many industries collapsed leaving thousands of citizens unemployed. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} However, some of the industries, including [[Podgorica Aluminium Plant|Podgorica aluminium smelter]] and [[Planta\u017ee]], managed to survive the turmoil of the 1990s, and are still major contributors to Montenegrin export and industrial output to this day.\n\nAs Montenegro began its push for independence from Serbia in the late 1990s, Podgorica greatly benefited from increased concentration of government and service sectors. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} In addition to almost the entire country's government, Podgorica is home to the [[Montenegro Stock Exchange]] and other major Montenegrin financial institutions, along with telecommunications carriers, media outlets, [[Montenegro Airlines|Montenegrin flag carrier airline]], and other significant institutions and companies.\n\nThe large presence of government and service sectors spared the economy of Podgorica from prolonged stagnation in the [[Great Recession|late 2000s recession]], which hit Montenegro hard. Although, in mid-2014, some 30% of Montenegro's citizens lived in Podgorica, the municipality accounted for 44% of the country's employed. Out of the entire mass of paid nwt salaries in Montenegro in that year, some 47% was paid in Podgorica. The average monthly net salary in May, 2014 was \u20ac509 in Podgorica municipality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monstat.org/userfiles/file/publikacije/2014/6/zaposlenost%20i%20zarade.pdf |title=Monthly Statistical Review, no. 6/2014 |format=pdf|publisher=Monstat |date=2014-05-05 |accessdate=2014-10-13}}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Capital Plaza of Podgorica Trg Svetog Petra Cetinjskog IMG 1291 Ulitsa Dr Ljubomira Ra\u0161ovi\u0107a.jpg|The Capital Plaza\nFile:Telenor.JPG|Telenor Center\nFile:DeltaPG.JPG|Delta City\nFile:PC Kru\u0161evac.JPG|TC Kru\u0161evac\n</gallery>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Further|Demographics of Podgorica}}\n{{Historical populations\n|type =\n|1948|14369 |1953|19868 |1961|35054 |1971|61727 |1981|96074 |1991|117875 |2003|136473 |2011|150977 |2018|199715\n|\n}}\n\nAlthough medium-sized by European standards, Podgorica is by far the largest city in [[Montenegro]]: almost one third of Montenegrin citizens live there. According to the 2011 census, there are 185,937 people in Podgorica Capital City, which is analogous to metropolitan area, and includes the small towns of [[Tuzi]] and [[Golubovci]], while 150,977 people live within the city proper.\n\nOut of the total population of Podgorica, 48.73% are male, while 51.27% are female. The average age of the population is 35.7. [[Serbian language|Serbian]] is the most spoken language, with 42.4% of Podgorica citizens declaring it as their first language. It is followed closely by [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]], at 41.17%. Other significant languages spoken in Podgorica are [[Albanian language|Albanian]] (5.53%) and [[Romani language|Romani]] (1.81%).\n\nThe majority of Podgorica citizens are [[Orthodox Christians]] (78.27%), while there are significant minorities of [[Muslims]] (11.23%) and [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] (4.27%).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=\"100\" | Nationality (2011 census)\n! width=\"80\" | Number\n! width=\"80\" | Percentage\n|-\n| [[Montenegrins]] || 106,642 || 57.35%\n|-\n| [[Serbs]] || 43,248 || 23.26%\n|-\n| [[Albanians]] || 9,538 || 5.13%\n|-\n| [[Muslims by nationality|Muslims]] || 4,122 || 2.22%\n|-\n| [[Bosniaks]] || 3,687\t || 1,98%\n|-\n| [[Romani people|Romani]] || 3,988 || 2.14%\n|-\n| others || 5,820 || 3.13%\n|-\n| undeclared || 8,892 || 4.78%'''\n|}\n\n==Religion==\n[[File:Podgorica, cattedrale della resurrezione di cristo, esterno 01.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ, Podgorica|Cathedral of Podgorica]].]]\n[[File:Manastir Dajbabe - panoramio (2).jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Dajbabe Monastery]].]]\n\nPodgorica is home to three main religious groups: [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]], [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslims]] and [[Catholicism|Catholic Christians]].\n\nOrthodox Christian population mostly originates from the local [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrin]] and [[Serb]] population, which accepted [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] in Middle Ages after a major split during [[East\u2013West Schism|The Great Schism]]. They represent the major religious group. There are various Eastern Orthodox churches in the City such as St. George Church which originates from the 13th century, or [[Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ (Podgorica)|Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ]] which is the largest church in the city to have been recently erected.\nThe [[Muslims|Muslim]] population mostly originates from local [[Bosniaks]], as well as [[Albanians]].\n\nThere are several mosques in Podgorica and [[Tuzi]]. Catholic population mainly consists of local Albanian minority. The main religious site for the Catholic population located in the [[Konik, Montenegro|Konik neighbourhood]] is the [[Church of the Holy Heart of Jesus (Podgorica)|Church of the Holy Heart of Jesus]] constructed in 1966, in [[Brutalist architecture|Brutalist]] style which makes this object unique.

The city assembly has 59 members, elected directly for four-year terms. The mayor used to be directly elected for five-year term, but since the new law was introduced in Montenegrin municipalities mayors will be elected by the city assembly and will have to maintain its support during his term. Separate elections are held for the local sub-division of [[Golubovci]] since it is part of their administrative autonomy inside Podgorica municipality. Constant questions are raised by various politicians over gaining separate municipality status for [[Golubovci]]. In 2018, [[Tuzi Municipality|Tuzi]] became its own municipality after a vote on the Montenegrin Parliament.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdm.me/english/tuzi-will-become-independent-municipality/|title=Tuzi became its own Municipality.}}</ref>\n\nOn local elections held on 25 May 2014, the [[Democratic Party of Socialists]] won 29 seats in the municipal assembly, one short of 30 needed to form a majority. [[Democratic Front (Montenegro)|Democratic Front]] won 17 seats, [[Socialist People's Party of Montenegro|SNP]] won 8 seats, while coalition made of [[Positive Montenegro]] and [[Social Democratic Party of Montenegro|SDP]] won 5 seats. After lengthy negotiations, SDP dissolved coalition with Pozitivna, and made arrangement on forming majority with DPS, similar to one they have in national government. While SDP is longtime partner of DPS at national level, it has been in opposition in Podgorica municipal assembly in 2010-2014 period. \nSince October 2014, position of the mayor is held by [[Democratic Party of Socialists|DPS]] official, Slavoljub Stijepovi\u0107, replacing Podgorica mayor od 14 years, [[Miomir Mugo\u0161a]].\n\n===City Assembly===\n{{see|Podgorica City Assembly election, 2018}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left;\"\n!colspan=2|Party/Coalition\n!Seats\n!Local government\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: #F6931D\" |\n| [[Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro|Democratic Party of Socialists]] \n| {{Composition bar|32|60|hex=#F6931D}}\n| {{yes|Government}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: red\" |\n| [[Democratic Montenegro]] \n| {{Composition bar|12|60|hex=#FF0000}}\n| {{no|Opposition}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: darkred\" |\n| [[United Reform Action]]\n| {{Composition bar|5|60|hex=darkred}}\n| {{no|Opposition}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: darkblue\" |\n| [[Democratic Front (Montenegro)|Democratic Front]] \n| {{Composition bar|5|60|hex=darkblue}}\n| {{no|Opposition}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: cornflowerblue\" |\n| [[Socialist People's Party of Montenegro|Socialist People's Party]]\n| {{Composition bar|3|60|hex=cornflowerblue}}\n| {{no|Opposition}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: #fd00ff\" |\n| [[Social Democrats of Montenegro|Social Democrats]] \n| {{Composition bar|3|60|hex=#fd00ff}}\n| {{yes|Government}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: blue\" |\n| [[Albanian Alternative]]\n| {{Composition bar|1|60|hex=blue}}\n| {{no|Opposition}}\n|}\n\n===Local subdivisions===\n{{Main|Subdivisions of Podgorica}}\n\nThe municipality of Podgorica consists of ''Podgorica City Proper'' and one subdivision (called ''[[city municipality]],'' \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0435 \u043e\u043f\u0448\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0435, ''gradske op\u0161tine''), which is [[Golubovci]].\n\nThe entire municipality of Podgorica is further divided into 57 ''[[local community|local communities]]'' (\u043c\u0458\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0458\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0435, ''mjesne zajednice''), bodies in which the citizens participate in decisions on matters of relevance to the local community.\n\n==Education==\n\nMost of Montenegro's higher education establishments are in Podgorica.

In the meantime, the number of private institutions for higher education has increased, like [[University of Donja Gorica|UDG - University of Donja Gorica]]. The municipality of Podgorica has 34 elementary schools and 10 secondary schools, including one [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]. The first secondary school established in Podgorica is [[Gymnasium \"Slobodan \u0160kerovi\u0107\"]]. The rebuilt economic high school offers new features and higher quality education.

The company went bankrupt in 2001, and buses were since operated solely by private carriers.\n\nPublic transport faces competition from very popular dispatched taxi services. De-regulation and stiff competition has made taxi services very affordable. {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} Over 20 taxi companies are operating in Podgorica with close to 800 vehicles in service. {{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Usually, taxi companies provide a high level of service, with relatively new and uniform car fleets and [[GPS]]-tracked vehicles.\n\n===Roads===\n[[File:Sozina-Tunnel.png|thumb|350px|[[Sozina Tunnel]] shortens the journey from Podgorica to Montenegro's main port [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]], by some 25 km.]]\nPodgorica's location in central Montenegro makes it a natural hub for rail and road transport. Roads in Montenegro (especially those connecting Podgorica to northern Montenegro and [[Serbia]]) are usually inferior to modern European roads. Both major Montenegrin motorway projects, [[A-1 motorway (Montenegro)|Bar-Boljare motorway]] and [[Adriatic\u2013Ionian motorway#Montenegro|Nudo\u2013Bo\u017eaj motorway]], will pass near Podgorica. The newly built [[Sozina tunnel]] (4.2&nbsp;km) shortened the journey from Podgorica to [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]] (Montenegro's main seaport) to under 30 minutes. Also a new road bypass has been constructed in 2011, to remove transport routes from north to south of the country, out of the city centre. A south-western bypass has also been planned {{citation needed|date=August 2017}}, with same goal of moving heavy transport out of the city core. Podgorica is also characteristic for its extensive network of multi-lane boulevards which make inner city transport quick and effective. Traffic over the [[Mora\u010da River]] also goes fluently since river banks are very well connected with 6 vehicular and 3 pedestrian bridges.\n\nThe current main transit connections of Podgorica are:\n* north ([[European route E65|E65]], [[European route E80|E80]]), towards [[Belgrade]] and on to Central Europe\n* west ([[European route E762|E762]]), towards [[Nik\u0161i\u0107]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] and on to Western Europe\n* south ([[European route E65|E65]], [[European route E80|E80]]) towards the [[Adriatic coast]]\n* east ([[European route E762|E762]]), towards [[Albania]]\n\n===Rail===\n[[File:01.10.13 Podgorica 6111.101 & 461.040 (10101220063).jpg|thumb|[[Podgorica Rail Station]].]]\nPodgorica is a hub of the X-shaped [[Railways of Montenegro|Montenegrin rail network]].

The station itself is located {{convert|1.5|km|2|abbr=on}} to the southeast of the main city square. Podgorica's main railway link (for both passenger and freight traffic) is Belgrade\u2013Bar.  The link to [[Nik\u0161i\u0107]] was recently under reconstruction ([[Railway electrification system|electrification]]);<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.montenegroberza.com/code/navigate.asp?Id=718|title=U \u017deljeznicu ula\u017eu 52 miliona eura}}</ref> afterwards, passenger service started in October 2012. The rail link to [[Shkod\u00ebr]] is currently used as freight-only.\n\n===Air===\n[[File:Podgorica airport.jpg|thumb|[[Podgorica Airport]] near [[Golubovci]].]]\n[[Podgorica Airport]] is located in [[Zeta Plain]], {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of Podgorica City centre, and is Montenegro's main international airport.

The city is close to winter skiing centres in the north and to seaside resorts on the [[Adriatic Sea]].\n\n[[Podgorica Municipality]] covers 10.4% of Montenegro's territory and is home to 29.9% of the country's population. It is the nation's administrative centre and its economic, cultural, and educational focus.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Podgorica'' means \"[area] below Gorica\". Gorica, meaning \"little hill\", is the name of one of the [[cypress]]-covered [[hillock]]s that overlook the city centre.\n\nSome three kilometres ({{convert|3|km|abbr=off|disp=output only}}) north-west of Podgorica lie the ruins of the Roman-era town of [[Doclea (town)|Doclea]], from which the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Diocletian]] hailed. In later centuries, Romans \"corrected\" the name to {{lang|la|Dioclea}}, guessing wrongly that an ''i'' had been lost in vulgar speech. {{lang|zls|Duklja}} is the later [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] version of that word.\n\nAt its foundation (some time before the 11th century), the town was called '''Birziminium'''. In the [[Middle Ages]], it was known as '''Ribnica''' (Montenegrin Cyrillic: {{lang|sh|\u0420\u0438\u0431\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430}} {{IPA-sh|r\u00eebnitsa|}}). The name Podgorica was used from 1326. From 1946 to 1992, the city was [[List of places named after Tito|named]] '''Titograd''' in honour of [[Josip Broz Tito]], the former [[President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|President of Yugoslavia]].\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\n[[File:Doclea Roman city Podgorica.jpg|thumb|left|[[Doclea (town)|Doclea]], Roman town, the seat of the Late Roman province of [[Praevalitana]].]]\n[[File:Ancient city Doclea - ruins 06.jpg|thumb|right|190px|Archeological remains of the Roman period in Doclea.]]\nPodgorica is at the [[Crossroads (culture)|crossroads]] of several historically important routes, near the rivers [[Zeta River|Zeta]], [[Mora\u010da]], [[Cijevna]], [[Ribnica (river)|Ribnica]], [[Sitnica (Mora\u010da)|Sitnica]] and [[Mareza]] in the valley of [[Lake Skadar]] and near the Adriatic Sea, in fertile lowlands with favourable climate. The earliest human settlements were in prehistory: the oldest physical remains are from the late [[Stone Age]].\n\nIn the [[Iron Age]], the area between the [[Zeta plain|Zeta]] and [[Bjelopavli\u0107i plain|Bjelopavli\u0107i valleys]] was occupied by two Illyrian tribes, the [[Labeates]] and the [[Docleatae]]. The population of the town of Doclea was 8,000\u201310,000, in which all core urban issues were resolved. The high population density (in an area of about {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} radius) was made possible by the geographical position, favourable climate and economic conditions and by the defensive positions that were of great importance at that time.\n\n===Middle Ages===\nFrom the 5th century AD, with the arrival of the first [[Sclaveni|Slavic]] and [[Pannonian Avars|Avar]] tribes and the beginning of the break-up of the [[Roman Empire]], the area bore witness to many noteworthy events. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} With time, the fortifications ceased their function and new towns were built; a new settlement probably named after the Ribnica river, on whose banks it was built, Ribnica, was established. It was first mentioned during the reign of the [[Nemanji\u0107 dynasty]], as part of the [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Serbian kingdom]]. The importance of Ribnica was its position as crossroads in communications with the west. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe name Podgorica was first mentioned in 1326 in a court document of the [[Kotor]] archives. The city was economically strong: trade routes between the [[Republic of Ragusa]] and Serbia, well developed at that time, were maintained via the road that led to Podgorica through [[Trebinje]] and [[Nik\u0161i\u0107]]. As a busy crossroad, Podgorica was a vibrant regional centre of trade and communication. This boosted its development, economic power, military strength and strategic importance. {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n===Ottoman Empire===\n[[File:28iulsah.jpg|thumb|View of [[Depedogen|Ribnica fortress and Old bridge]], Catholic Church (right), Debbaglar Bridge, government mansion and the Mirko Varosh Hotel (far left), before 1901.]]\n[[File:Sahat-kula in Podgorica.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[Clock Tower (Podgorica)|City Clock Tower]].]]\nThe [[Ottoman Empire]] captured Podgorica in 1474.

This part of the city is today traditionally regarded as city centre, and is called ''Nova Varo\u0161'' (''New town'')\n\nDuring World War II, Podgorica was almost razed to the ground, being [[Bombing of Podgorica in World War II|bombed over 70 times]]. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} After liberation, rebuilding began as in other cities of the communist-ruled SFRY. Mass residential blocks were erected, with basic design typical of [[Eastern bloc]] countries. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} All that part of the city on the right bank of the [[Mora\u010da River]] was built this way.\n\nThe main contemporary traffic arteries were laid out during this period, which extended the orthogonal street layout of city center, to the south and west. Residential and infrastructural developments in the SFRY era have mostly shaped the layout of today's Podgorica, and accommodated the unprecedented population growth that followed World War II. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n<gallery>\nSaborniHram.JPG|[[Roman Square (Podgorica)|Roman Square]] and [[Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ, Podgorica|Cathedral of Podgorica]].\nMost_Bla\u017ea_Jovanovi\u0107a.jpg|[[Bla\u017eo Jovanovi\u0107 Bridge]] over the Mora\u010da.\nPodgorica_EKIP_and_Prva_TV_IMG_1286_82_Bulevar_D%C5%BEord%C5%BEa_Va%C5%A1ingtona.JPG|Office building at George Washington Street\nBlok_5_i_6.jpg|Highrise housing in Podgorica.\nDelta City - panoramio.jpg|[[Delta Holding|Delta Shopping Mall]].\nBulevar Svetog Petra Cetinjskog, 2019.jpg|[[Peter I of Montenegro|St Peter of Cetinje]] Boulevard\nAerodromPodgorica.jpg|[[Podgorica Airport]]\nMora\u010da Sports Center.jpg|[[Mora\u010da Sports Center]]\n</gallery>\n\nA major advance in Podgorica architecture began in the late 1990s and, since then, the face of the city has changed rapidly. Residential and business construction are proceeding rapidly, incorporating contemporary glass-and-steel architectural trends. In an effort to create a recognizable and modern state capital, city officials are routing significant investments in city's public spaces. Thus, the city has gained entirely new squares, parks and monuments. New landmarks include the ''Hristovog Vaskrsenja'' [[Orthodox temple (church)|orthodox temple]] and the [[Millennium Bridge, Podgorica|Millennium Bridge]], the main feature of the Podgorica skyline. \n{{wide image|Dva_mosta_Podgorica_banner.jpg|1400px|A panoramic view of the [[Moscow bridge]] (right) and the [[Millennium Bridge (Montenegro)|Millennium Bridge]] (left).

The Montenegrin National Theatre is the most significant theatre not only in Podgorica but in all of Montenegro. Podgorica is also host to the City Theatre (''Gradsko pozori\u0161te''), which includes the Children's Theatre and the Puppet Theatre. Although not as rich in museums and galleries as the historic royal capital [[Cetinje]], there are several noteworthy museums:\n\n[[File:Novi_Grad,_Podgorica,_Montenegro_-_panoramio_(9).jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ, Podgorica|Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ]] interior.]]\n[[File:Royal Garden in Podgorica.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Former residence of King Nikola I Petrovi\u0107, today an art gallery.]]\n[[File:Crnogorsko Narodno Pozori\u0161te.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Montenegrin National Theatre]]]]\n[[File:Podgorica, museo nazionale, esterno 01.JPG|thumb|left|200px|{{nowrap|National Museum of Montenegro}}]]\n* The Podgorica City Museum (''Muzej grada Podgorice'') preserves Podgorica's rich heritage. Founded in 1950, it has four categories: archaeological, ethnographic, historical and cultural-historical. It houses artefacts which date back to the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Illyria]]n eras. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n* The Archaeological Research Centre (''Centar za arheolo\u0161ka istra\u017eivanja'') was founded in 1961. Its mission is to gather, classify, restore and display archaeological sites.\n* The [[Marko Miljanov]] Museum (''Muzej Marka Miljanova'') in [[Medun]] shows life in 19th century Montenegro. \n* The Natural History Museum (''Prirodnja\u010dki muzej'') displays specimens of Montenegrin flora and fauna. This museum has no exhibition space of its own, despite many proposals and initiatives to build one. {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\nThere is a notable art gallery in the ''Dvorac'' [[House of Petrovi\u0107|''Petrovi\u0107a'']] ([[Podgorica Royal Palace|Petrovi\u0107 Castle]]) complex in Podgorica's largest public park. [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|King Nicholas]]'s castle, ''Perjani\u010dki Dom'' (House of the Honour Guard), castle chapel and surrounding buildings were converted to an art gallery in 1984. Since 1995, it has been part of the Modern Arts Centre (''Centar savremenih umjetnosti'') and houses approximately 1,500 works of art. The historic Cinema of Culture (''Kino Kultura''), which was founded in 1949, was closed in November 2008 due to continuous financial losses it generated. It was the only cinema in the city for 6 decades. The building of the former cinema will be converted to host the Podgorica City Theatre. Shortly after its closure, a [[Ster-Kinekor]] (later acquired by [[Cineplexx Cinemas|Cineplexx]]) 6-screen [[Multiplex (movie theater)|multiplex]] cinema opened at [[Delta City]] shopping mall.\n\nA significant cultural institution of over fifty years' standing is the Budo Tomovi\u0107 Cultural-Informational Centre (''KIC Budo Tomovi\u0107''). It is a public institution which organizes various artistic events, including Podgorica Cultural Summer (''Podgori\u010dko Kulturno Ljeto''), FIAT \u2013 International Alternative Theatre Festival (''Festival Internacionalnog Alternativnog Teatra''), DEUS \u2013 December Arts Scene (''Decembarska Umjetni\u010dka Scena'').\n\n==Media==\nPodgorica is the media hub of Montenegro. It is home to the headquarters of the state-owned [[public television]] broadcaster [[RTCG]]. Commercial broadcasters in Podgorica include [[RTV A1]], [[TV Vijesti]], [[Nova M]] and [[Prva TV]]. It was announced that the city's local television will be launched soon.<ref>[http://www.cgvijesti.net/209191_Mugosa-Podgorica-dobija-svoju-televiziju.html Mugo\u0161a: Podgorica dobija svoju televiziju] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723040909/http://www.cgvijesti.net/209191_Mugosa-Podgorica-dobija-svoju-televiziju.html |date=23 July 2011 }}</ref> Their programmes can be received in much of Montenegro.\n\nAll Montenegro's daily newspapers (oldest Montenegrin daily newspaper ''[[Pobjeda]]'', ''[[Vijesti]]'', ''[[Dnevne Novine]]'' and ''[[Dan (newspaper)|Dan]]'') are published in Podgorica, as the weekly magazines ''[[The Monitor (Montenegro)|Monitor]]'' and ''[[Magazin BIT]]''.\n\n==Sports==\n[[File:Novi_Grad,_Podgorica,_Montenegro_-_panoramio_(34).jpg|thumb|right|[[Mora\u010da Sports Center]].]]\nThe most popular sports by far are [[association football|football]] and [[basketball]]. Basketball became especially popular with the success in the late 20th and early 21st centuries of [[KK Budu\u0107nost Podgorica|KK Budu\u0107nost]], both in [[ABA League|Regional]] and European competitions.\n\nFootball in Podgorica has a long tradition associated with [[FK Budu\u0107nost Podgorica|Budu\u0107nost]]. World-famous players [[Predrag Mijatovi\u0107]] and [[Dejan Savi\u0107evi\u0107]] were born in Podgorica and made their debut in that team. The club [[FK Zeta]] from the Podgorica suburb of [[Golubovci]] has also reached the former first league of Serbia and Montenegro. These clubs, along with [[FK Sutjeska Nik\u0161i\u0107|Sutjeska]] from Nik\u0161i\u0107, usually compete with each other for leading position in the [[First League of Montenegro]].\nOther clubs from Podgorica and its surroundings play in the Montenegrin First League e.g. [[OFK Titograd]] & [[FK Kom|Kom]]. One of the most popular clubs from the suburbs is [[FK Ribnica]] from [[Konik, Montenegro|Konik]], [[FK Zabjelo]] from [[Zabjelo]] and [[OFK Mladost Lje\u0161kopolje|OFK Mladost 1970]] from ''Donja Gorica''.\n\nThe volleyball team [[OK Budu\u0107nost Podgorica|OK Budu\u0107nost]] and the women's handball team [[\u017dRK Budu\u0107nost T-Mobile]] have had significant success in European competition. [[Budu\u0107nost Podgorica]] is the most important sports club in Podgorica. Its name means ''Future''.\n\n[[Chess]] is another popular sport and some famous global chess players, like [[Slavko Dedi\u0107]], are born in Podgorica.\n\nSporting events like the annual [[Podgorica Marathon]] and the ''Mora\u010da River'' jumps attract international competitors.\nPodgorica was the host of [[2009 FINA Men's Water Polo World League]].\n\n===Venues===\n[[File:PodgoricaCityStadium2017.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Podgorica City Stadium]]]]\nPodgorica has a number of sporting venues; some are under reconstruction and expansion. The main ones are:\n*[[Podgorica City Stadium]]. It has a capacity of 11,264 and it is the home of [[FK Budu\u0107nost Podgorica]] and the [[Montenegro national football team]]. It is currently the only venue in Montenegro that complies with [[FIFA]] standards for international football matches.\n*[[Mora\u010da Sports Center]], a multi functional indoor sport facility. It has a capacity of 6 000 seats. It hosted one group of [[EuroBasket 2005]], while other games were played in [[Belgrade Arena|Belgrade]], [[Millennium Centar|Vr\u0161ac]], and [[Spens Sports Center|Novi Sad]].\n\nAlmost every football club in Podgorica has its own stadium, although these are often only fields with small stands or no stands at all.\nOther notable venues are the [[Stadion malih sportova]] under Gorica hill and the [[sport shooting]] range under Ljubovi\u0107 hill. There are many other sports facilities around the city, most notably [[indoor soccer]] fields.\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Podgorica_National_bank_of_Montenegro.JPG|thumb|left|Central Bank of Montenegro.]]\n[[File:Podgorica-Tuzi plantaze wineyard IMG 1318 Cijevna river.JPG|thumb|right|Aerial view of the [[Planta\u017ee]] wineyard, this wine field is the largest single one in Europe.]]\nPodgorica is not only the administrative centre of Montenegro, but also its main economic engine. Most of Montenegro's industrial, financial, and commercial base is in Podgorica. {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nBefore World War I, most of Podgorica's economy was in trade and small-scale manufacture, which was an economic model established during the long rule of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} After World War II, Podgorica became Montenegro's capital and a focus of the rapid urbanization and industrialization of the SFRY era. Industries such as aluminium and tobacco processing, [[textile industry|textiles]], engineering, vehicle production, and wine production were established in and around the city. In 1981, Podgorica's GDP per capita was 87% of the Yugoslav average.<ref>{{cite book | title=Atlas svijeta: Novi pogled na Zemlju | year=1984 | edition=3rd | publisher=Sveu\u010dili\u0161na naklada Liber | location=Zagreb | language=Croatian | editor1-first=Radovan | editor1-last=Radovinovi\u0107 | editor2-first=Ivan | editor2-last=Berti\u0107}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1990s, the [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|dissolution of Yugoslavia]], [[Yugoslav wars]], and the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 757|UN-imposed sanctions]] left Podgorica's industries without traditional markets, suppliers, and available funds. This, combined with typical [[Transition economy|transition]] pressures, led to a decline of the industrial base, where many industries collapsed leaving thousands of citizens unemployed. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} However, some of the industries, including [[Podgorica Aluminium Plant|Podgorica aluminium smelter]] and [[Planta\u017ee]], managed to survive the turmoil of the 1990s, and are still major contributors to Montenegrin export and industrial output to this day.\n\nAs Montenegro began its push for independence from Serbia in the late 1990s, Podgorica greatly benefited from increased concentration of government and service sectors. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} In addition to almost the entire country's government, Podgorica is home to the [[Montenegro Stock Exchange]] and other major Montenegrin financial institutions, along with telecommunications carriers, media outlets, [[Montenegro Airlines|Montenegrin flag carrier airline]], and other significant institutions and companies.\n\nThe large presence of government and service sectors spared the economy of Podgorica from prolonged stagnation in the [[Great Recession|late 2000s recession]], which hit Montenegro hard. Although, in mid-2014, some 30% of Montenegro's citizens lived in Podgorica, the municipality accounted for 44% of the country's employed. Out of the entire mass of paid nwt salaries in Montenegro in that year, some 47% was paid in Podgorica. The average monthly net salary in May, 2014 was \u20ac509 in Podgorica municipality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monstat.org/userfiles/file/publikacije/2014/6/zaposlenost%20i%20zarade.pdf |title=Monthly Statistical Review, no. 6/2014 |format=pdf|publisher=Monstat |date=2014-05-05 |accessdate=2014-10-13}}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Capital Plaza of Podgorica Trg Svetog Petra Cetinjskog IMG 1291 Ulitsa Dr Ljubomira Ra\u0161ovi\u0107a.jpg|The Capital Plaza\nFile:Telenor.JPG|Telenor Center\nFile:DeltaPG.JPG|Delta City\nFile:PC Kru\u0161evac.JPG|TC Kru\u0161evac\n</gallery>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Further|Demographics of Podgorica}}\n{{Historical populations\n|type =\n|1948|14369 |1953|19868 |1961|35054 |1971|61727 |1981|96074 |1991|117875 |2003|136473 |2011|150977 |2018|199715\n|\n}}\n\nAlthough medium-sized by European standards, Podgorica is by far the largest city in [[Montenegro]]: almost one third of Montenegrin citizens live there.

The average age of the population is 35.7. [[Serbian language|Serbian]] is the most spoken language, with 42.4% of Podgorica citizens declaring it as their first language. It is followed closely by [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]], at 41.17%. Other significant languages spoken in Podgorica are [[Albanian language|Albanian]] (5.53%) and [[Romani language|Romani]] (1.81%).\n\nThe majority of Podgorica citizens are [[Orthodox Christians]] (78.27%), while there are significant minorities of [[Muslims]] (11.23%) and [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] (4.27%).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=\"100\" | Nationality (2011 census)\n! width=\"80\" | Number\n! width=\"80\" | Percentage\n|-\n| [[Montenegrins]] || 106,642 || 57.35%\n|-\n| [[Serbs]] || 43,248 || 23.26%\n|-\n| [[Albanians]] || 9,538 || 5.13%\n|-\n| [[Muslims by nationality|Muslims]] || 4,122 || 2.22%\n|-\n| [[Bosniaks]] || 3,687\t || 1,98%\n|-\n| [[Romani people|Romani]] || 3,988 || 2.14%\n|-\n| others || 5,820 || 3.13%\n|-\n| undeclared || 8,892 || 4.78%'''\n|}\n\n==Religion==\n[[File:Podgorica, cattedrale della resurrezione di cristo, esterno 01.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ, Podgorica|Cathedral of Podgorica]].]]\n[[File:Manastir Dajbabe - panoramio (2).jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Dajbabe Monastery]].]]\n\nPodgorica is home to three main religious groups: [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]], [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslims]] and [[Catholicism|Catholic Christians]].\n\nOrthodox Christian population mostly originates from the local [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrin]] and [[Serb]] population, which accepted [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] in Middle Ages after a major split during [[East\u2013West Schism|The Great Schism]]. They represent the major religious group. There are various Eastern Orthodox churches in the City such as St. George Church which originates from the 13th century, or [[Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ (Podgorica)|Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ]] which is the largest church in the city to have been recently erected.\nThe [[Muslims|Muslim]] population mostly originates from local [[Bosniaks]], as well as [[Albanians]].\n\nThere are several mosques in Podgorica and [[Tuzi]]. Catholic population mainly consists of local Albanian minority. The main religious site for the Catholic population located in the [[Konik, Montenegro|Konik neighbourhood]] is the [[Church of the Holy Heart of Jesus (Podgorica)|Church of the Holy Heart of Jesus]] constructed in 1966, in [[Brutalist architecture|Brutalist]] style which makes this object unique.

The city assembly has 59 members, elected directly for four-year terms. The mayor used to be directly elected for five-year term, but since the new law was introduced in Montenegrin municipalities mayors will be elected by the city assembly and will have to maintain its support during his term. Separate elections are held for the local sub-division of [[Golubovci]] since it is part of their administrative autonomy inside Podgorica municipality. Constant questions are raised by various politicians over gaining separate municipality status for [[Golubovci]]. In 2018, [[Tuzi Municipality|Tuzi]] became its own municipality after a vote on the Montenegrin Parliament.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdm.me/english/tuzi-will-become-independent-municipality/|title=Tuzi became its own Municipality.}}</ref>\n\nOn local elections held on 25 May 2014, the [[Democratic Party of Socialists]] won 29 seats in the municipal assembly, one short of 30 needed to form a majority.

After lengthy negotiations, SDP dissolved coalition with Pozitivna, and made arrangement on forming majority with DPS, similar to one they have in national government. While SDP is longtime partner of DPS at national level, it has been in opposition in Podgorica municipal assembly in 2010-2014 period. \nSince October 2014, position of the mayor is held by [[Democratic Party of Socialists|DPS]] official, Slavoljub Stijepovi\u0107, replacing Podgorica mayor od 14 years, [[Miomir Mugo\u0161a]].\n\n===City Assembly===\n{{see|Podgorica City Assembly election, 2018}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left;\"\n!colspan=2|Party/Coalition\n!Seats\n!Local government\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: #F6931D\" |\n| [[Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro|Democratic Party of Socialists]] \n| {{Composition bar|32|60|hex=#F6931D}}\n| {{yes|Government}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: red\" |\n| [[Democratic Montenegro]] \n| {{Composition bar|12|60|hex=#FF0000}}\n| {{no|Opposition}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: darkred\" |\n| [[United Reform Action]]\n| {{Composition bar|5|60|hex=darkred}}\n| {{no|Opposition}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: darkblue\" |\n| [[Democratic Front (Montenegro)|Democratic Front]] \n| {{Composition bar|5|60|hex=darkblue}}\n| {{no|Opposition}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: cornflowerblue\" |\n| [[Socialist People's Party of Montenegro|Socialist People's Party]]\n| {{Composition bar|3|60|hex=cornflowerblue}}\n| {{no|Opposition}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: #fd00ff\" |\n| [[Social Democrats of Montenegro|Social Democrats]] \n| {{Composition bar|3|60|hex=#fd00ff}}\n| {{yes|Government}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: blue\" |\n| [[Albanian Alternative]]\n| {{Composition bar|1|60|hex=blue}}\n| {{no|Opposition}}\n|}\n\n===Local subdivisions===\n{{Main|Subdivisions of Podgorica}}\n\nThe municipality of Podgorica consists of ''Podgorica City Proper'' and one subdivision (called ''[[city municipality]],'' \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0435 \u043e\u043f\u0448\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0435, ''gradske op\u0161tine''), which is [[Golubovci]].\n\nThe entire municipality of Podgorica is further divided into 57 ''[[local community|local communities]]'' (\u043c\u0458\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0458\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0435, ''mjesne zajednice''), bodies in which the citizens participate in decisions on matters of relevance to the local community.\n\n==Education==\n\nMost of Montenegro's higher education establishments are in Podgorica. It is home to the [[University of Montenegro]], the country's most significant such institution. The following faculties are in Podgorica:\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-2}}\n* [[University of Montenegro Faculty of Economics|Faculty of Economics]]\n* [[University of Montenegro Faculty of Law|Faculty of Law]]\n* [[University of Montenegro Faculty of Electrical Engineering|Faculty of Electrical Engineering]]\n* [[University of Montenegro Faculty of Metallurgy and Technology|Faculty of Metallurgy and Technology]]\n* [[University of Montenegro Faculty of Political Sciences|Faculty of Political Sciences]]\n* Faculty of [[Civil Engineering]]\n{{col-2}}\n* Faculty of [[Mechanical Engineering]]\n* Faculty of [[Natural Sciences]] and [[Mathematics]]\n* [[University of Montenegro Faculty of Medicine|Faculty of Medicine]]\n* [[University of Montenegro Faculty of Pharmacy|Faculty of Pharmacy]]\n* [[University of Montenegro Faculty of Architecture|Faculty of Architecture]]\n* [[University of Montenegro Faculty of Biotechnology|Faculty of Biotechnology]]\n{{col-2}}\n{{col-end}}\n\nThe university's scientific research institutes are in the city:\n* Institute of Foreign Languages\n* Institute of Biotechnology\n* Institute of History\n\nThe [[Montenegrin Academy of Sciences and Arts]] is in Podgorica, as is the [[Doclean Academy of Sciences and Arts|DANU]] cultural organization.\n\nThe [[Mediterranean University]] was founded 2006 as first private university in Montenegro. In the meantime, the number of private institutions for higher education has increased, like [[University of Donja Gorica|UDG - University of Donja Gorica]]. The municipality of Podgorica has 34 elementary schools and 10 secondary schools, including one [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]. The first secondary school established in Podgorica is [[Gymnasium \"Slobodan \u0160kerovi\u0107\"]]. The rebuilt economic high school offers new features and higher quality education. The Radosav Ljumovi\u0107 National Library is considered the most comprehensive in Montenegro.\n\n==Transport==\n\n===Public transport===\n[[File:PGWelcome.jpg|thumb|left|Northern entrance to Podgorica ([[European route E65|E65]], [[European route E80|E80]]).]]\n[[File:Millennium Bridge in Podgorica, Montenegro 02.jpg|thumb|left|[[Millennium Bridge (Montenegro)|Millennium Bridge]].]]\nPublic transport in Podgorica consists of 11 urban and 16 suburban bus lines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.podgorica.me/%C5%BDivotuPodgorici/Saobra%C4%87aj/tabid/129/language/sr-Latn-CS/Default.aspx |title=Saobra\u0107aj |publisher=Podgorica.me |accessdate=2013-03-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130325043642/http://www.podgorica.me/%C5%BDivotuPodgorici/Saobra%C4%87aj/tabid/129/language/sr-Latn-CS/Default.aspx |archivedate=25 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The city-owned ''AD Gradski saobra\u0107aj'' public transport company used to be the sole bus operator until the 1990s, when private carriers were introduced. The company went bankrupt in 2001, and buses were since operated solely by private carriers.\n\nPublic transport faces competition from very popular dispatched taxi services. De-regulation and stiff competition has made taxi services very affordable. {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} Over 20 taxi companies are operating in Podgorica with close to 800 vehicles in service. {{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Usually, taxi companies provide a high level of service, with relatively new and uniform car fleets and [[GPS]]-tracked vehicles.\n\n===Roads===\n[[File:Sozina-Tunnel.png|thumb|350px|[[Sozina Tunnel]] shortens the journey from Podgorica to Montenegro's main port [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]], by some 25 km.]]\nPodgorica's location in central Montenegro makes it a natural hub for rail and road transport. Roads in Montenegro (especially those connecting Podgorica to northern Montenegro and [[Serbia]]) are usually inferior to modern European roads. Both major Montenegrin motorway projects, [[A-1 motorway (Montenegro)|Bar-Boljare motorway]] and [[Adriatic\u2013Ionian motorway#Montenegro|Nudo\u2013Bo\u017eaj motorway]], will pass near Podgorica. The newly built [[Sozina tunnel]] (4.2&nbsp;km) shortened the journey from Podgorica to [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]] (Montenegro's main seaport) to under 30 minutes. Also a new road bypass has been constructed in 2011, to remove transport routes from north to south of the country, out of the city centre. A south-western bypass has also been planned {{citation needed|date=August 2017}}, with same goal of moving heavy transport out of the city core. Podgorica is also characteristic for its extensive network of multi-lane boulevards which make inner city transport quick and effective. Traffic over the [[Mora\u010da River]] also goes fluently since river banks are very well connected with 6 vehicular and 3 pedestrian bridges.\n\nThe current main transit connections of Podgorica are:\n* north ([[European route E65|E65]], [[European route E80|E80]]), towards [[Belgrade]] and on to Central Europe\n* west ([[European route E762|E762]]), towards [[Nik\u0161i\u0107]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] and on to Western Europe\n* south ([[European route E65|E65]], [[European route E80|E80]]) towards the [[Adriatic coast]]\n* east ([[European route E762|E762]]), towards [[Albania]]\n\n===Rail===\n[[File:01.10.13 Podgorica 6111.101 & 461.040 (10101220063).jpg|thumb|[[Podgorica Rail Station]].]]\nPodgorica is a hub of the X-shaped [[Railways of Montenegro|Montenegrin rail network]]. The [[Belgrade\u2013Bar railway|Belgrade\u2013Bar]] line converges with the [[Nik\u0161i\u0107-Podgorica railway|line to Nik\u0161i\u0107]] and [[Podgorica\u2013Shkod\u00ebr railway|line to Shkod\u00ebr]] at the [[Podgorica Rail Station]]. The station itself is located {{convert|1.5|km|2|abbr=on}} to the southeast of the main city square. Podgorica's main railway link (for both passenger and freight traffic) is Belgrade\u2013Bar.  The link to [[Nik\u0161i\u0107]] was recently under reconstruction ([[Railway electrification system|electrification]]);<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.montenegroberza.com/code/navigate.asp?Id=718|title=U \u017deljeznicu ula\u017eu 52 miliona eura}}</ref> afterwards, passenger service started in October 2012. The rail link to [[Shkod\u00ebr]] is currently used as freight-only.\n\n===Air===\n[[File:Podgorica airport.jpg|thumb|[[Podgorica Airport]] near [[Golubovci]].]]\n[[Podgorica Airport]] is located in [[Zeta Plain]], {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of Podgorica City centre, and is Montenegro's main international airport. The airport is locally known as Golubovci Airport (\u0410\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0440\u043e\u043c \u0413\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0431\u043e\u0432\u0446\u0438 / Aerodrom Golubovci), as it is located within the administrative boundaries of the town of [[Golubovci]]. The IATA code of the airport is still TGD because Podgorica was named Titograd, during which time the airport opened.

Dennis recalls first meeting Roddy Ricch at a studio session one a day in March 2019, whereafter they \"just kept working ever since then\" from that day on. Ricch had just returned to the US after touring with [[Post Malone]] on the European leg of Malone's [[Beerbongs & Bentleys Tour]]. Ricch's label wanted to start working on his debut album, something which Ricch also expressed interest in. Dennis says they spent a \"solid year\" working on the album, changing tracklists\u00a0constantly and recording new music. He used production software Plugin Alliance which, he explained, \"has no [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] in the recording on any of the [[Plug-in (computing)|plugins]]\". For the album, Ricch didn't want to employ a lot of effects or [[Reverberation|reverb]], because \"he likes his stuff really clean, dry, and in your face. That was the learning curve in the beginning \u2014\u00a0getting his clean vocals. You also have to work fast because he can record a song in 10 minutes\", Dennis stated. [[The Box (Roddy Ricch song)|\"The Box\"]], for instance, was recorded in roughly 15 minutes. On the track \"War Baby\", a choir was used, an idea Ricch came up with. The choir was arranged through Ricch's cousin. \n\nAround 250 songs were recorded for the album. Dennis revealed a lot of those songs will instead appear on other people's albums.<ref name=\"Studio Sessions\"/>\n\n==Commercial performance==\n''Please Excuse Me for Being Antisocial'' debuted atop the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with 101,000 [[album-equivalent unit]]s (including 3,000 pure album sales).

Dennis recalls first meeting Roddy Ricch at a studio session one a day in March 2019, whereafter they \"just kept working ever since then\" from that day on. Ricch had just returned to the US after touring with [[Post Malone]] on the European leg of Malone's [[Beerbongs & Bentleys Tour]]. Ricch's label wanted to start working on his debut album, something which Ricch also expressed interest in. Dennis says they spent a \"solid year\" working on the album, changing tracklists\u00a0constantly and recording new music. He used production software Plugin Alliance which, he explained, \"has no [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] in the recording on any of the [[Plug-in (computing)|plugins]]. For the album, Ricch didn't want to employ a lot of effects or [[Reverberation|reverb]], because \"he likes his stuff really clean, dry, and in your face. That was the learning curve in the beginning \u2014\u00a0getting his clean vocals. You also have to work fast because he can record a song in 10 minutes\", Dennis stated. [[The Box (Roddy Ricch song)|\"The Box\"]], for instance, was recorded in roughly 15 minutes. On the track \"War Baby\", a choir was used, an idea Ricch came up with. The choir was arranged through Ricch's cousin. \n\nAround 250 songs were recorded for the album. Dennis revealed a lot of those songs will instead appear on other people's albums.<ref name=\"Studio Sessions\"/>\n\n==Commercial performance==\n''Please Excuse Me for Being Antisocial'' debuted atop the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with 101,000 [[album-equivalent unit]]s (including 3,000 pure album sales).

Female (left) and male Vertical styles]]\nMost '''African sculpture''' was historically in wood and other organic materials that have not survived from earlier than at most a few centuries ago; older pottery figures are found from a number of areas. [[Traditional African masks|Masks]] are important elements in the art of many peoples, along with human figures, often highly stylized.  There is a vast variety of styles, often varying within the same context of origin depending on the use of the object, but wide regional trends are apparent; sculpture is most common among \"groups of settled cultivators in the areas drained by the [[Niger]] and [[Congo river]]s\" in [[West Africa]].<ref>Honour & Fleming, 557</ref>  Direct images of [[List of African mythological figures|African deities]] are relatively infrequent, but masks in particular are or were often made for [[Traditional African religions|traditional African religious]] ceremonies; today many are made for tourists as \"airport art\".<ref>Honour & Fleming, 559\u2013561</ref>  African masks were an influence on European [[Modernism|Modernist]] art, which was inspired by their lack of concern for naturalistic depiction.\n\n==By region==\n{{See|Sculpture#Africa}}\nThe [[Nubia]]n [[Kingdom of Rush]] in modern [[Susan]] was in close and often hostile contact with Egypt, and produced monumental sculpture mostly derivative of styles to the north.  In West Africa, the earliest known sculptures are from the [[Nok culture]] which thrived between 500 BC and 500 AD in modern [[Nigeria]], with clay figures typically with elongated bodies and angular shapes.<ref>Breunig, P. 2015. [https://books.google.de/books?id=BBn1BQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&hl=de&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false Nok. African Sculpture in Archaeological Context.] Africa Magna, Frankfurt a. M.</ref> Later West African cultures developed bronze casting for reliefs to decorate palaces like the famous [[Benin Bronzes]], and very fine naturalistic royal heads from around the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] town of [[Ife]] in terracotta and metal from the 12th to the 14th centuries. [[Akan goldweights]] are a form of small metal sculptures produced over the period 1400\u20131900, some apparently representing [[proverb]]s and so with a narrative element rare in African sculpture, and royal regalia included impressive gold sculptured elements.<ref>Honour & Fleming, 556\u2013561</ref>\n\nMany West African figures are used in religious rituals and are often coated with materials placed on them for ceremonial offerings.  The [[Mand\u00e9 peoples|Mande]]-speaking peoples of the same region make pieces of wood with broad, flat surfaces and arms and legs are shaped like cylinders.  In Central Africa, however, the main distinguishing characteristics include heart-shaped faces that are curved inward and display patterns of circles and dots.\n\nEastern Africans are not known for their sculpture,<ref>Honour & Fleming, 557</ref> but one style from the region is pole sculptures, carved in human shapes and decorated with geometric forms, while the tops are carved with figures of animals, people, and various objects. These poles are, then, placed next to graves and are associated with death and the ancestral world.  The culture known from [[Great Zimbabwe]] left more impressive buildings than sculpture but the eight [[soapstone]] [[Zimbabwe Bird]]s appear to have had a special significance and were mounted on [[monolith]]s.  Modern [[Zimbabwe]]an sculptors in soapstone have achieved [[Sculpture of Zimbabwe|considerable international success]].  Southern Africa's oldest known clay figures date from 400 to 600 AD and have cylindrical heads with a mixture of human and animal features.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nBrooklyn Museum 74.64 Helmet Mask ndoli jowei for Sande Society.jpg|Helmet mask (ndoli jowei) for [[Sande society]]; late 19th-early 20th century; wood; 39.4 x 23.5 x 26&nbsp;cm (15{{fraction|1|2}} x 9{{fraction|1|4}} x 10{{fraction|1|4}} in.); [[Brooklyn Museum]] (New York City).

Female (left) and male Vertical styles]]\nMost '''African sculpture''' was historically in wood and other organic materials that have not survived from earlier than at most a few centuries ago; older pottery figures are found from a number of areas. [[Traditional African masks|Masks]] are important elements in the art of many peoples, along with human figures, often highly stylized.  There is a vast variety of styles, often varying within the same context of origin depending on the use of the object, but wide regional trends are apparent; sculpture is most common among \"groups of settled cultivators in the areas drained by the [[Niger]] and [[Congo river]]s\" in [[West Africa]].<ref>Honour & Fleming, 557</ref>  Direct images of [[List of African mythological figures|African deities]] are relatively infrequent, but masks in particular are or were often made for [[Traditional African religions|traditional African religious]] ceremonies; today many are made for tourists as \"airport art\".<ref>Honour & Fleming, 559\u2013561</ref>  African masks were an influence on European [[Modernism|Modernist]] art, which was inspired by their lack of concern for naturalistic depiction.\n\n==By region==\n{{See|Sculpture#Africa}}\nThe [[Nubia]]n [[Kingdom of Kush]] in modern [[Sudan]] was in close and often hostile contact with Egypt, and produced monumental sculpture mostly derivative of styles to the north.  In West Africa, the earliest known sculptures are from the [[Nok culture]] which thrived between 500 BC and 500 AD in modern [[Nigeria]], with clay figures typically with elongated bodies and angular shapes.<ref>Breunig, P. 2015. [https://books.google.de/books?id=BBn1BQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&hl=de&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false Nok. African Sculpture in Archaeological Context.] Africa Magna, Frankfurt a. M.</ref> Later West African cultures developed bronze casting for reliefs to decorate palaces like the famous [[Benin Bronzes]], and very fine naturalistic royal heads from around the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] town of [[Ife]] in terracotta and metal from the 12th to the 14th centuries. [[Akan goldweights]] are a form of small metal sculptures produced over the period 1400\u20131900, some apparently representing [[proverb]]s and so with a narrative element rare in African sculpture, and royal regalia included impressive gold sculptured elements.<ref>Honour & Fleming, 556\u2013561</ref>\n\nMany West African figures are used in religious rituals and are often coated with materials placed on them for ceremonial offerings.  The [[Mand\u00e9 peoples|Mande]]-speaking peoples of the same region make pieces of wood with broad, flat surfaces and arms and legs are shaped like cylinders.  In Central Africa, however, the main distinguishing characteristics include heart-shaped faces that are curved inward and display patterns of circles and dots.\n\nEastern Africans are not known for their sculpture,<ref>Honour & Fleming, 557</ref> but one style from the region is pole sculptures, carved in human shapes and decorated with geometric forms, while the tops are carved with figures of animals, people, and various objects. These poles are, then, placed next to graves and are associated with death and the ancestral world.  The culture known from [[Great Zimbabwe]] left more impressive buildings than sculpture but the eight [[soapstone]] [[Zimbabwe Bird]]s appear to have had a special significance and were mounted on [[monolith]]s.  Modern [[Zimbabwe]]an sculptors in soapstone have achieved [[Sculpture of Zimbabwe|considerable international success]].  Southern Africa's oldest known clay figures date from 400 to 600 AD and have cylindrical heads with a mixture of human and animal features.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nBrooklyn Museum 74.64 Helmet Mask ndoli jowei for Sande Society.jpg|Helmet mask (ndoli jowei) for [[Sande society]]; late 19th-early 20th century; wood; 39.4 x 23.5 x 26&nbsp;cm (15{{fraction|1|2}} x 9{{fraction|1|4}} x 10{{fraction|1|4}} in.); [[Brooklyn Museum]] (New York City).

If the Rumble Pak is inserted, the Nintendo DS will vibrate when it is the player's turn in the game. The compilation contains three different modes: Free Play, Stamp Mode, and Mission Mode.\n\nIn Free Play mode, the player may choose any of the 42 games available to play. ''Clubhouse Games'' divides its 42 games up into eight categories. These are the categories and the titles found in each:\n*Card games: [[Old Maid]], [[Spit (card game)|Spit]], [[I Doubt It]], [[Sevens (card game)|Sevens]], [[Concentration (game)|Memory]], [[Pig (card game)|Pig]], [[Blackjack]], [[Hearts (card game)|Hearts]], [[President (card game)|President]], [[Rummy]], [[Seven Bridge]], [[Last Card]], [[Crazy Eights|Last Card Plus]], [[Five-card draw|Five Card Draw]], [[Texas hold 'em]], [[Napoleon (card game)|Nap]], [[Spades (card game)|Spades]], and [[Contract Bridge]].\n*Board games: [[Chinese checkers]], [[Checkers]], [[Dots and Boxes]], [[Hasami shogi]], [[Reversi|Turncoat]], [[Gomoku|Connect Five]], [[Battleship (game)|Grid Attack]], [[Backgammon]], [[Chess]], [[Shogi]], [[Stratego|Field Tactics]], and [[Ludo (board game)|Ludo]].\n* Variety games: [[Soda Shake]], [[Dominoes]], [[Koi-Koi]], and [[Hangman (game)|Word Balloon]].\n* Action games: [[Bowling]], [[Darts]], [[Billiards]], [[Balance (ability)|Balance]], and [[:Category:Disk-flicking games|Takeover]].\n* Single player games: [[Klondike (solitaire)|Solitaire]], [[Klotski|Escape]], and [[Mahjong solitaire]].\n\nStamp Mode is a [[single-player video game|single-player mode]] that has three levels of difficulty. Players receive 1\u20133 stamps depending on how they place in the games. Several games in the \"Free Play\" mode are locked until the player plays them in Stamp Mode. After completing the first \"easy\" level of Stamp Mode, normal and hard modes are unlocked. Beating the normal level unlocks the \"stamp\" section in the chat window; finishing hard gives the player a new color to use in the chat window and one last stamp.\n\nMission Mode is a single-player mode that features 30 missions to accomplish. Some missions include beating the \"Memory\" card game under three minutes, bowling three strikes in a row, or getting 200 points in Darts. When a mission is successfully completed, another icon is unlocked. When all 30 missions have been completed, the \"Pop\" set of music is unlocked.\n\n===Multiplayer===\nA player may send over a demo of a game by using the \"gift\" option. He or she can set the difficulty of the CPU. It is similar to the [[DS Download Station]] demo; the receiving player may play the game as many times as they want, but once the Nintendo DS is turned off, the game is erased.\n\n''Clubhouse Games'' supports the [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]] service. The original Japanese version did not feature WFC support; an April 2007 release features it. Out of the 42 games, Old Maid, Spit, I Doubt It, Pig, and the three \"Single Player Games\" are not playable over WFC. With strangers, players may send pre-selected messages (such as \"Good game!\" and \"Aaack!\") and [[emoticon]]s. Like all other WFC games, it uses a friends list and friend codes. Against friends, players can draw out messages.\n\nClubhouse Games also support Single-Card and Multi-Card Download Play for up to 8 people.\n\n==Development==\nThe 42 games included in ''Daredemo Asobi Taizen'' are similar to the games included in ''Clubhouse Games'', but there are some differences. The original Japanese version lacks the [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]] service and the aesthetics of many games have been changed. The games [[Goninkan]], [[Bozu mekuri]], [[Sugoroku]], Seesaw Game, [[Nim|Last One]], [[Mini Golf]], and Napoleon (a Japanese card game, unrelated to the British card game Nap) are exclusive to ''Daredemo Asobi Taizen''. Texas Hold 'Em, Dots and Boxes, Grid Attack, Ludo, Dominoes, Escape, and Mahjong Solitaire are exclusive to the international version.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| GR = 82.1%<ref>[http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/933040.asp Clubhouse Games Reviews].

It was first released in [[Japan]] on November 3, 2005, in [[Europe]] on September 29, 2006, in [[North America]] on October 9, 2006, and in [[Australia]] on October 26, 2006.\n\nSome of the games included in the North American version of the title are different from those included in the original Japanese version. On April 19, 2007, the North American version was released in Japan with support for the [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]], as {{nihongo foot|'''''Wi-Fi Taiou: International Daredemo Asobi Taizen'''''|Wi-Fi\u5bfe\u5fdc\u4e16\u754c\u306e\u3060\u308c\u3067\u3082\u30a2\u30bd\u30d3\u5927\u5168|Wi-Fi Compatible: International Everyone's Playing Encyclopedia|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}}. The European version of the title was given a \"12+\" rating by the [[Pan European Game Information|PEGI]] as some of the games, such as [[Poker|Five Card Draw]] and [[Texas hold 'em]], contain elements of [[gambling]]; the Australian [[Office of Film and Literature Classification (Australia)|OFLC]] gave the game a PG rating for the same reason.\n\nA follow-up, '''''Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics''''' (known as '''''51 Worldwide Games''''' in Europe and {{nihongo foot|'''''Sekai No Asobi Taizen 51'''''|\u4e16\u754c\u306e\u30a2\u30bd\u30d3\u5927\u516851|World Playing Encyclopedia 51|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} in Japan), is slated for release on June 5, 2020 for the [[Nintendo Switch]]. It will contain 51 games.<ref>{{cite web |title=Nintendo brings back Club House Games for Switch|url=https://venturebeat.com/2020/03/26/nintendo-brings-back-club-house-games-for-switch/|publisher=[[VentureBeat]]|last=Grubb|first=Jeff|date=2020-03-26|accessdate=2020-03-27}}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe compilation is compatible with the Nintendo DS [[Rumble Pak]]. If the Rumble Pak is inserted, the Nintendo DS will vibrate when it is the player's turn in the game. The compilation contains three different modes: Free Play, Stamp Mode, and Mission Mode.\n\nIn Free Play mode, the player may choose any of the 42 games available to play. ''Clubhouse Games'' divides its 42 games up into eight categories. These are the categories and the titles found in each:\n*Card games: [[Old Maid]], [[Spit (card game)|Spit]], [[I Doubt It]], [[Sevens (card game)|Sevens]], [[Concentration (game)|Memory]], [[Pig (card game)|Pig]], [[Blackjack]], [[Hearts (card game)|Hearts]], [[President (card game)|President]], [[Rummy]], [[Seven Bridge]], [[Last Card]], [[Crazy Eights|Last Card Plus]], [[Five-card draw|Five Card Draw]], [[Texas hold 'em]], [[Napoleon (card game)|Nap]], [[Spades (card game)|Spades]], and [[Contract Bridge]].\n*Board games: [[Chinese checkers]], [[Checkers]], [[Dots and Boxes]], [[Hasami shogi]], [[Reversi|Turncoat]], [[Gomoku|Connect Five]], [[Battleship (game)|Grid Attack]], [[Backgammon]], [[Chess]], [[Shogi]], [[Stratego|Field Tactics]], and [[Ludo (board game)|Ludo]].\n* Variety games: [[Soda Shake]], [[Dominoes]], [[Koi-Koi]], and [[Hangman (game)|Word Balloon]].\n* Action games: [[Bowling]], [[Darts]], [[Billiards]], [[Balance (ability)|Balance]], and [[:Category:Disk-flicking games|Takeover]].\n* Single player games: [[Klondike (solitaire)|Solitaire]], [[Klotski|Escape]], and [[Mahjong solitaire]].\n\nStamp Mode is a [[single-player video game|single-player mode]] that has three levels of difficulty. Players receive 1\u20133 stamps depending on how they place in the games. Several games in the \"Free Play\" mode are locked until the player plays them in Stamp Mode. After completing the first \"easy\" level of Stamp Mode, normal and hard modes are unlocked. Beating the normal level unlocks the \"stamp\" section in the chat window; finishing hard gives the player a new color to use in the chat window and one last stamp.\n\nMission Mode is a single-player mode that features 30 missions to accomplish. Some missions include beating the \"Memory\" card game under three minutes, bowling three strikes in a row, or getting 200 points in Darts. When the player successfully completes one mission, they unlock another icon. When all 30 missions have been completed, the player unlocks the \"Pop\" set of music.\n\n===Multiplayer===\nA player may send over a demo of a game by using the \"gift\" option. He or she can set the difficulty of the CPU. It is similar to the [[DS Download Station]] demo; the receiving player may play the game as many times as they want, but once the Nintendo DS is turned off, the game is erased.\n\n''Clubhouse Games'' supports the [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]] service. The original Japanese version did not feature WFC support; an April 2007 release features it. Out of the 42 games, Old Maid, Spit, I Doubt It, Pig, and the three \"Single Player Games\" are not playable over WFC. With strangers, players may send pre-selected messages (such as \"Good game!\" and \"Aaack!\") and [[emoticon]]s. Like all other WFC games, it uses a friends list and friend codes. Against friends, players can draw out messages.\n\nClubhouse Games also support Single-Card and Multi-Card Download Play for up to 8 people.\n\n==Development==\nThe 42 games included in ''Daredemo Asobi Taizen'' are similar to the games included in ''Clubhouse Games'', but there are some differences. The original Japanese version lacks the [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]] service and the aesthetics of many games have been changed. The games [[Goninkan]], [[Bozu mekuri]], [[Sugoroku]], Seesaw Game, [[Nim|Last One]], [[Mini Golf]], and Napoleon (a Japanese card game, unrelated to the British card game Nap) are exclusive to ''Daredemo Asobi Taizen''. Texas Hold 'Em, Dots and Boxes, Grid Attack, Ludo, Dominoes, Escape, and Mahjong Solitaire are exclusive to the international version.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| GR = 82.1%<ref>[http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/933040.asp Clubhouse Games Reviews].
