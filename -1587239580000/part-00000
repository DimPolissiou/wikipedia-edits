The French fleet had the year before blockaded the [[British Army during the American War of Independence|British Army]] at Chesapeake Bay during the [[Siege of Yorktown]] and supported the eventual American victory in their revolution.\n\nThe French suffered heavy casualties at the Saintes and many were taken prisoner, including the admiral, Comte de Grasse. Four French ships of the line were captured (including the [[flagship]]) and one was destroyed. Rodney was credited with pioneering the tactic of \"[[Naval tactics in the Age of Sail|breaking the line]]\" in the battle, though this is disputed.<ref name=\"O'Shaugh\"/><ref>Valin p.67-68</ref>\n\n==Background==\nIn October 1781, Admiral Comte de Grasse, commander of the French fleet in the West Indies; [[Francisco Saavedra de Sangronis]], General Bureau for the Spanish Indies; and [[Bernardo de G\u00e1lvez]], court representative and aide to the Spanish [[Governor of Louisiana]], developed a plan against British forces. The strategic objectives of the Franco-Spanish military forces in the West Indies in this plan were:\n* to aid the Americans and defeat the British naval squadron at [[New York City|New York]]\n* to capture the British [[Windward Islands]] and\n* to conquer Jamaica.<ref>Dull p. 244</ref>\n\nThis plan became known as the \"De Grasse \u2013 Saavedra Convention\". The first objective was essentially met by the surrender of the British army under [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|General Cornwallis]] at the [[Siege of Yorktown]] in September 1781. De Grasse and his fleet [[Battle of the Chesapeake|played a decisive part]] in that victory, after which they returned to the Caribbean. On arrival in [[Saint Domingue]] in November 1781, the admiral was notified to proceed with a plan for the conquest of Jamaica.<ref>Dull p. 248-49</ref>\n\nJamaica was the largest and most profitable British island in the Caribbean, mainly because of [[sugar]]; it was more valuable to the British economy than all of the thirteen American colonies. [[King George III]] wrote to [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich|Lord Sandwich]], saying that he would risk protecting Britain's important Caribbean islands at the risk of Britain herself, and this was the strategy implemented in 1779.<ref>O'Shaughnessy p. 208</ref> Sugar made up 20% of all British imports and was worth five times as much as [[tobacco]].<ref>Rogozi\u0144ski p. 115</ref> The French and Spanish were fighting to take over Jamaica in order to expel the British from the West Indies, and to strike a massive blow against the British economy.<ref>Trew p. 154-55</ref> The courts at [[Paris]] and [[Madrid]] perceived the invasion of Jamaica as an alternative to the [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|Spanish and French attempts to take Gibraltar]], which for two years had been a costly disaster.<ref>Dull p. 282</ref>\n\nWhile de Grasse waited for reinforcements to undertake the Jamaica campaign, he [[Siege of Brimstone Hill|captured St. Kitts]] in February 1782. The rest of the [[Windward Islands]] - [[Antigua]], [[St Lucia]], and [[Barbados]] - still remained under British control. Admiral George Rodney arrived in the Caribbean theatre the following month, bringing reinforcements. These included seventeen ships of the line and gave the British a slight numerical advantage.<ref name=\"Trew\">Trew p. 157-62</ref>\n\nOn 7 April 1782, de Grasse set out from [[Martinique]] with 35 [[ships of the line]], including two 50-gun ships and a large convoy of more than 100 cargo ships, to meet with a Spanish fleet of 12 ships of the line. In addition, de Grasse was to rendezvous with 15,000 troops at Saint Domingue, who were earmarked for the conquest and intended to land on Jamaica's north coast.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Rodney, on learning of this, sailed from [[St Lucia]] in pursuit with 36 [[ships of the line]] the following day.<ref name=\"Mahan1\">Mahan. p. 205\u2212226</ref>\n\nThe British [[Hull (watercraft)|hulls]] by this time had been given [[copper sheathing]] to protect them from [[barnacle|marine growth]] and [[biofouling|fouling]], as well as salt water corrosion. This dramatically improved speed and sailing performance as a whole in good wind.<ref name=\"Lavery\">Lavery p. 144-45</ref>\n\n===The Lines===\n[[File:Plan of the early ship movements leading to the Battle of the Saintes April 1782.jpg|thumb|280px|Plan of the early ship movements leading to the Battle of the Saintes April 1782]]\nThe British flagship was [[HMS Formidable (1777)|HMS ''Formidable'']] under [[Admiral Rodney]]. Second in command was [[Sir Samuel Hood, 1st Baronet|Admiral Samuel Hood]] and third was Vice Admiral [[Francis Samuel Drake]]. As was the convention of the day the fleet was split into three sections: Rodney had individual control as [[Admiral of the White]] of 12 ships flying the [[White Ensign]]; Drake had command of 12 ships flying the [[Blue Ensign]] as [[Admiral of the Blue]]; Hood was [[Admiral of the Red]] with 12 ships flying the [[Red Ensign]].<ref name=\"Fraser102\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=102}}</ref>\n\nThe Formidable was accompanied by three 98-gun ships: [[HMS Barfleur (1768)|HMS ''Barfleur'']] (commanded by Hood), [[HMS Prince George (1772)|HMS ''Prince George'']] and [[HMS Duke (1777)|HMS ''Duke'']] plus the 90-gun [[HMS Namur (1756)|HMS ''Namur'']]. The remaining 31 ships ranged from 64-gun to 74-gun. In total the British fleet had 2620 guns compared to the French total of 2526. Most of the British fleet was equipped with [[carronade]]s on the upper decks, which had a major advantage of flexibility, and were a great advantage at close quarters.<ref name=\"Fraser102\"/>\n\nIn March 1782, ''Formidable'' was stationed at Gros Islet Bay between the island of [[St. Lucia]] in the [[West Indies]] and [[Pigeon Island (Saint Lucia)|Pigeon Island]]. It was under the command of Admiral [[George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney|Admiral Rodney]], serving as his flagship at the head of 36 [[ship of the line]]. Meanwhile the French admiral, [[Fran\u00e7ois Joseph Paul de Grasse|De Grasse]], headed 34 ship of the line at Fort Royal Bay in [[Martinique]]. Rodney had been dispatched from Britain with 12 well-fitted ships to rescue the West Indies from a series of attacks from the French which had already resulted in the loss of several islands. They joined 24 ships on St Lucia which had already seen action against the French and were undergoing repairs.<ref name=\"Fraser102\"/>\n\nThe French had allies in the Spanish, who had 13 ship of the line at [[Cape Haitien]] in [[San Domingo]]. Together with transport ships the Spanish had a considerable force of 24,000 men. They awaited the arrival of a further 10,000 French troops dispatched from [[Brest, France|Brest]], under escort of five men-of-war, to further boost their strength. The plan was that de Grasse's fleet, with at least 5000 further troops, would unite with the Spanish at Cape Haitien, and from there would attack and capture the island of [[Jamaica]] with their conjoined armada of some 60 ships and some 40,000 troops.\n\nRodney had been in communication with De Grasse during March organising the exchange of prisoners, which were conveyed by [[HMS Alert (1779)|HMS ''Alert'']] under Captain Vashon. The two officers had much mutual respect. Rodney's task was to intercept the French fleet en route to Cape Haitien.\n\nDe Grasse's vice admiral at the time was [[Louis-Philippe de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil]]. Third in command was [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]]. The French flagship was the huge 104-gun [[French ship Ville de Paris (1764)|Ville de Paris]]. The troops were under the command of the [[Marquis de Bouille]]. The French fleet was also split into three squadrons: De Grasse led the \"Cornette Blanche\"; Bougainville led the \"Escadre Bleu\"; de Vaudreuil as a second-in-command flew the mixed blue and white colours of the \"Blanche et Bleu\".<ref name=\"Fraser102\"/>\n\nOther British commanders included [[Lord Robert Manners (Royal Navy officer)|Lord Robert Manners]] of [[HMS Resolution (1770)|HMS ''Resolution'']]. Admiral [[William Cornwallis]] was in command of [[HMS Canada (1765)|HMS ''Canada'']]. [[HMS Monarch (1765)|HMS ''Monarch'']] was under the command of [[Francis Reynolds-Moreton, 3rd Baron Ducie|Captain Reynolds]]. Other aristocrats present included [[James Cranstoun, 8th Lord Cranstoun|Captain Lord Cranstoun]] on the ''Formidable''. Sir Charles Douglas, a nephew of [[Charles Douglas, 3rd Duke of Queensberry]], was Captain of the Fleet. [[James Wallace (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Wallace]] was also present. Other commanders included Captains Inglefield, Parry, Dumaresq, Buckner, Graves, Blair, Burnett, Savage, Symons, Charrington, Inglis, Cornish, Truscott, Saumarez, Knight, Wilson, Williams and Wilkinson.<ref name=\"Fraser72\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=72}}</ref>\n\nA look-out squadron, a line of frigates headed by Captain [[George Anson Byron]] on [[HMS Andromache (1781)|HMS ''Andromache'']], reported all of de Grasse's movements at Fort Royal. This squadron included the speedy [[HMS Agamemnon (1781)|HMS ''Agamemnon'']] and also [[HMS Magnificent (1766)|HMS ''Magnificent'']].<ref name=\"Fraser79\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=79}}</ref>\n\n===Pre-Battle Movements===\n{| style=\"float: right; margin-right: 1em\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#b0c4de;\"|Naval Commanders\n|-\n|<gallery>\nFile:Franecois joseph paul comte d115883.jpg|<center><br />[[Comte de Grasse]]</center>\nFile:Mosnier, George Rodney.jpg|<center><br />[[George Rodney]]</center>\n</gallery>\n|}\n\nOn 3 April it was signalled that the repairs on the French fleet were complete. On 5 April it was reported that the French troops were boarding the ships. At 8am on Sunday 8 April it was reported that the French fleet were leaving Fort Royal. Rodney's fleet called all men to join their ships and ships began leaving Gros Islet Bay at 10.30am.<ref name=\"Fraser80\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=80-81}}</ref>\n\nThe total French armada comprised 35 [[ship of the line]], 10 [[frigate]]s, and over 100 smaller ships. The smaller ships moved in advance of the men-of-war, heading for [[St. Pierre, Martinique|St Pierre]].<ref name=\"Fraser80\"/>\n\nJust past 4pm HMS ''Barfleur'' (under Hood) at the head of the British fleet espied 5 sails ahead which she presumed to be part of the French fleet. These came into view of the Formidable around two hours later, just before sunset. They pursued the French through the night. At 2am on 9 April [[HMS St Albans (1764)|HMS ''St Albans'']] dropped alongside Formidable, reporting that she, along with [[HMS Valiant (1759)|HMS ''Valiant'']], had located the French fleet in the darkness. Rodney rested for the remainder of the night.\n\nThe sun rose at 5.30am. The French fleet extended from 6 miles to 12 miles distant, navigating the waters between [[Dominica]] and [[Guadeloupe]]. The majority of the warships lay off [[Prince Rupert's Bay]].\n\nDue to a [[dead calm]] from 3am until 7am neither fleet could move. The initial wind only reached the ''Barfleur'' and its eight support ships, causing it to detach ahead of the main fleet, which lay in the [[Lee side|lee]] of Dominica. De Grasse saw the opportunity to cripple this advanced section and wheeled to begin the first attack.\n\n== Battle ==\nOn 9 April 1782, the copper-sheathed British fleet caught up with the French, who were surprised by their speed.<ref name\"Stevens173\">Stevens p. 173</ref> Admiral de Grasse ordered the French convoy to head into [[Guadeloupe]] for repair, forcing him to escort two fifty-gun ships (''Fier'' and ''Experiment''), and placing his fleet in line of battle in order to cover the retreat.<ref name=\"Stevens173\">{{Harvnb|Allen|2009|p=173}}</ref>\n\n===First encounters===\nHood's section of the fleet, headed by [[HMS Barfleur (1768)|HMS ''Barfleur'']], braced for the first attack. [[HMS Alfred (1778)|HMS Alfred]] taunted the 18 French ships under de Vaudreuil which approached, as the first action, by exposing her broadside to the approaching French but without consequence. The British patiently awaited the formal signal from Rodney on the Formidable, some six miles behind, and eventually received a red flag signal telling them to \"engage the enemy\". As the wind rose around noon it enabled most of the French fleet and part of the British fleet (including Rodney in the ''Formidable'') joined the melee. At this point the French outnumbered the British two to one.<ref name=\"Fraser86\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=86-89}}</ref> Captain William Bayne on the Alfred was killed during this action.<ref name=\"Fraser111\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=111}}</ref>\n\nAfter an inconclusive encounter in which both sides suffered damage, Grasse realised that the remainder of the British fleet would soon be upon them. He broke off the engagement to withdraw a safe distance.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Grasse moved his ships to the [[Saintes islands]] to the north (south of [[Gaudeloupe]]. Meanwhile Rodney reversed the order of his line to bring Drake's thus far undamaged ships to the front, and allow Hood to undertake repairs in the rear lines.<ref name=\"Fraser90\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=90-92}}</ref>\n\nOn 10 April the French began 10 miles distant but did not turn to engage, but instead continued on their original course. By nightfall that increased their separation to 15 miles. This appears partly due to a wrong presumption on Rodney's part that the French were going to turn to engage.<ref name=\"Fraser90\"/>\n\nOn Wednesday 11 April two French ships (the {{ship|French ship|Z\u00e9l\u00e9|1764|2}} and the [[French ship Magnanime (1779)|''Magnanime'']]) which had accidentally collided, and had fallen behind the main French fleet, came into view around noon. Rodney decided that attacking these two ships would cause de Grasse to return to protect them. This tactic worked and a large section of the French fleet turned to protect the pair. These movements were done without any physical attacks.<ref name=\"Fraser90\"/>\n\n===Main engagement===\n[[File:Battle of the Saintes plan.jpg|thumb|300px|Main stages of the battle]]\nOn 12 April, the French were ranged from 6 miles to 12 miles distant and were not in formation, as the two fleets manoeuvred between the northern end of Dominica and the Saintes, in what is known as the Saintes Passage. The unfortunate ''Z\u00e9l\u00e9'' had had a second collision during the night with one of its rescuers, the [[French ship Ville de Paris (1764)|''Ville de Paris'']]. It was now being towed to Basse Terre in Guadeloupe by [[French ship Astr\u00e9e|Astr\u00e9e]] (with [[Fran\u00e7ois Claude Amour, marquis de Bouill\u00e9|General de Bouille]] on board. They was chased by four British ships: [[HMS Monarch (1765)|''Monarch'']], [[HMS Valiant (1759)|''Valiant'']], [[HMS Centaur (1759)|''Centaur'']] and [[HMS Belliqueux (1780)|''Belliqueux'']]. De Grasse made for [[Guadeloupe]] and [[Glossary of nautical terms#B|bore up]] with his fleet to protect the ship and at the same time Rodney recalled his chasing ships and made the signal for [[line of battle]].<ref name=\"Mahan2\">Mahan p. 194\u2212221</ref>\n\nRear-Admiral Hood's van division were still making repairs from the action three days earlier, so he directed his rear division, under Rear Admiral [[Sir Francis Samuel Drake, 1st Baronet|Francis S. Drake]], to take the lead. At 7:40, {{HMS|Marlborough|1767|6}}, under Captain [[Taylor Penny]], led the British line and opened battle when he approached the centre of the French line.<ref name=\"Lavery\"/> Having remained parallel with the French, the ships of Drake's division passed the remaining length of de Grasse's line and the two sides exchanged [[broadside]]s, a typical naval engagement of this time.<ref name=\"Trew\"/>\n\n==== Initial attack ====\n[[HMS Marlborough (1767)|HMS ''Marlborough'']] under Captain [[Taylor Penny]] of [[Dorset]] headed the British attack.<ref name=\"Fraser103\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=103-05}}</ref>\n\nAs the battle progressed, the strong winds of the previous day and night began to temper and became more variable. As the French line passed down the British line, the sudden shift of wind let Rodney's flagship {{HMS|Formidable|1777|6}} and several other ships, including {{HMS|Duke|1777|6}} and {{HMS|Bedford|1775|6}}, sail toward the French line.<ref>Tanstall, Brian. ''Naval Warfare in the Age of Sail: the Evolution of Fighting Tactics 1680\u20141815''. Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, MD, 1990. p. 308. {{ISBN|1-55750-601-9}}</ref>\n\nAt 8 am, ''Formidable'' raised the red flag to permit the ''Marlborough'' to open fire and engage the French. At this point the ''Marlborough'' was opposite the [[French ship Dauphin Royal (1735)|''Dauphin Royal'']] who received her full broadside.<ref name=\"Fraser103\"/> Sixteen ships in line separated the ''Marlborough'' from the ''Formidable'' and each stood 200 metres apart. As each circled passed the French they fired a broadside against the French. Second, behind ''Marlborough'' was [[HMS Arrogant (1761)|HMS ''Arrogant'']] which had been recently re-equipped, managed three broadsides against one from the French as they passed. Third in line was [[HMS Alcide (1779)|HMS ''Alcide'']] under Captain Charles Thomson. Then followed [[HMS Nonsuch (1774)|HMS ''Nonsuch'']] under Captain Truscott then [[HMS Conqueror (1773)|HMS ''Conqueror'']] under Captain George Balfour.<ref name=\"Fraser103\"/>\n\nNext in line was Admiral Drake on HMS ''Princessa'' who was in command of the first twelve vessels and was followed by [[HMS Prince George (1772)|HMS ''Prince George'']] under Captain Williams. Then came the hundred year old [[HMS Neptune (1683)|HMS ''Torbay'']] under Captain Keppel and the year-old [[HMS Anson (1781)|HMS ''Anson'']] under Captain William Blair, who being on the main deck was struck by round shot at waist level and horrifically sliced in two. The blue squadron was then completed by [[HMS Fame (1759)|HMS ''Fame'']] and [[HMS Russell (1764)|HMS ''Russell'']] under Captain [[James Saumarez]].<ref name=\"Fraser107\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=107}}</ref>\n\nThe white squadron under Rodney followed in exact formation after the blue. This was headed by [[HMS America (1777)|HMS ''America'']] under Captain Thompson. [[HMS Hercules (1759)|HMS ''Hercules'']] under Captain Henry Savage followed. Then came [[HMS Prothee (1780)|HMS ''Prothee'']] under Captain Buckner and [[HMS Resolution (1770)|HMS ''Resolution'']] under [[Lord Robert Manners (Royal Navy officer)|Captain Robert Manners]]. The 24-year-old Manners was the first casualty on his ship, and was severely injured in both legs and right arm and later died of these wounds.<ref name=\"Fraser110\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=110-11}}</ref> ''Resolution'' was followed by HMS ''Duke'' under [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Captain Alan Gardner]].<ref name=\"Fraser110\"/>\n\nAs ''Formidable'' was in the centre of the British line it took her almost an hour to reach the centre of the action. All ships had to maintain a steady speed  and a she passed de Grasse's flagship, ''Ville de Paris'' of 104 guns the two met for the first time. The ''Ville de Paris'' was already damaged by the  fifteen ships ahead of ''Formidable'' in the line. Although it was a sunny day the smoke of the battle was like a dense fog.<ref name=\"Fraser113\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=113}}</ref> ''Formidable'' entered the smoke and approached the ''Ville de Paris'' at 8.40am.<ref name=\"Fraser117\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=117-19}}</ref>\n\nThe counter movement of the fleets brought a series of ships opposite the ''Formidable'' in sequence behind the ''Ville de Paris'', the movements bringing about a different pairing of enemies every five minutes. Next was [[French ship \u00c7a Ira (1781)|''Couronne'']], followed by [[French ship \u00c9veill\u00e9 (1752)|''\u00c9veill\u00e9'']] under Le Gardeur de Tilly then the [[French ship Sceptre (1780)|''Sceptre'']] under the command of de Vaudreuil.<ref name=\"Fraser117\"/>\n\n====Breaking the Line====\nWithin an hour, the wind had shifted to the south, forcing the French line to separate and bear to the west, as it could not hold its course into the wind. This allowed the British to use their guns on both sides of their ships without any fear of return fire from the front and rear of the French ships they were passing between. The effect was greater with the use of [[carronade]]s, with which the British had just equipped nearly half their fleet; this relatively new short-range weapon was quicker to reload and more of them could be carried. {{HMS|Glorieux||2}} moving in the wake of the ''Ville de Paris'' under command of Captain D'Escars was the next victim; virtually a sitting duck due to damage in the previous ten minutes from HMS Duke, she was quickly pounded and dismasted by intense fire. In the confusion, four French ships beginning with [[French ship Diad\u00e8me (1756)|''Diadem'']] broke out of sequence (partly due to the uncontrollable speed of the mastless ''Glorieux''). ''Formidable'' turned to starboard and brought her port guns to bear on them.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> As a result, ''Formidable'' sailed through the gap, breaking the French line. This breach was further followed through by five other British ships.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/> The breach was later recorded by [[Charles Dashwood (Royal Navy officer)|Charles Dashwood]] who was a midshipman on the ''Formidable'' on the day.<ref name=\"Fraser123\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=123}}</ref>\n[[File:Battle-of-the-Saintes-12th-April-1782-William-Elliott-1784-871.jpg|thumb|330px|''Lord Rodney\u2019s flagship ''Formidable'' breaking through the French line at the battle of the Saintes, 12th  1782''; painted by [[William Elliott (lieutenant)|William Elliott]]]]\n\nAlthough the concept of \"breaking the line\" was born here, the concept is logically of mixed blessings, since in breaking the enemy line, one breaks one's own line. Whilst the movement has the advantage that guns can be fired on both port and starboard sides, it also exposes the ship to attack on both sides. The advantage in this instance was that many of the French gunners left their post, in fear of the ''Formidable''s three tiers of guns bearing down on them.<ref name=\"Fraser126\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=126}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Diadem'' appears to have fully withdrawn from the battle at this stage, and many presumed her to be sunk. The ''Formidable'' was followed by [[HMS Namur (1756)|HMS ''Namur'']] under [[Robert Fanshawe (Royal Navy officer)|Captain Fanshawe]], then [[HMS St Albans (1764)|HMS ''St Albans'']] under [[Charles Inglis (c. 1731-1791)|Captain Inglis]]. These were followed by the deadly [[HMS Canada (1765)|HMS ''Canada'']] under Captain [[William Cornwallis]], [[HMS Repulse (1780)|HMS ''Repulse'']] under Captain Thomas Dumaresq, and [[HMS Ajax (1765)|HMS ''Ajax'']] under Captain Nicholas Charrington. Each of these fired further upon the hapless and already crippled ''Glorieux''.<ref name=\"Fraser122\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=122}}</ref>\n\nSimultaneously, by accident of the smoke, Commodore [[Edmund Affleck]] on [[HMS Bedford (1775)|HMS ''Bedford'']], the hindmost ship of the central white squadron, accidentally sailed through the confused French line, between [[French ship C\u00e9sar (1768)|''Cesar'']] and [[French ship Hector (1756)|''Hector'']], only discovering this error when no enemy lay on his starboard side in the clearing smoke.<ref name=\"Fraser130\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=130-33}}</ref>\n \nThe ''Bedford'' was followed by Hood's red squadron and this broke the French line into three sections. In the confusion the two leading ships of the rear red squadron, [[HMS Prince William (1780)|HMS ''Prince William'']] and [[HMS Magnificent (1766)|HMS ''Magnificent'']] had somehow passed the ''Bedford'', who was now third in line within the red squadron, completely detached from its own white squadron.<ref name=\"Fraser130\"/> The whole red squadron then passed between ''Cesar'' and ''Hector'', causing each to be crippled. The final ship of the red squadron, [[HMS Royal Oak (1769)|HMS ''Royal Oak'']], passed the stern of the ''Cesar'' and delivered a final blow a few minutes after 11am. Both fleets then drifted apart for some time and became temporarily becalmed.<ref name=\"Fraser130\"/>\n\nAround noon, to the horror of both fleets, it was spotted that the waters were teaming with sharks attracted by the noise and blood. French casualties were greatly increased due to the high number of troops packed onto the lower decks: a minimum of 900 per ship and no less than 1300 on the ''Ville de Paris''. In order to lessen the confusion the French had been throwing the dead (and perhaps the near dead) overboard, and this was a rich feast for the sharks.<ref name=\"Fraser130\"/>\n\n===French flight===\n[[File:The Battle of the Saints, 12 April 1782 RMG BHC0444.tiff|thumb|''Battle of the Saintes April 1782'' by [[Nicholas Pocock]]]]\nThe French now lay totally to the leeward of the British fleet and the fleet stood between them and their destination. They had little option on the re-emergence of the wind but to sail west with the wind, and try to escape. At 1pm the former British ship [[HMS Richmond (1757)|HMS ''Richmond'']], now renamed ''Richemont'', under command of Captain De Mortemart but with [[Denis Decr\u00e8s]] in charge of the marines, was sent to join a towing cable to the heavily crippled ''Glorieux''. [[French ship Souverain|''Souverain'']] moved alongside to provide covering fire. However the British, with both wind and cannon-power in their favour, moved a number of ships up to block this movement. The captain of the ''Glorieux'' was already dead, and she was under command of the senior officer remaining: Lieutenant Trogoff de Kerlessi. The ''Souverain'' and ''Richmond'' retreated under heavy fire and Kerlessi had little option but to tear the flag from the mast and surrender, which was done to the ''Royal Oak''. Captain Burnett used this opportunity to restock his depleted powder supplies. Meanwhile HMS ''Monarch'' stood alongside [[HMS Andromache (1781)|HMS ''Andromache'']] who was acting as a supply ship to the British fleet, and forty barrels of powder were exchanged.<ref name=\"Fraser137\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=137-38}}</ref>\n\nIn the next action, around 1.30, {{HMS|Centaur|1759|6}} and ''[[HMS Bedford]]'' attacked the stricken {{ship|French ship|C\u00e9sar|1768|2}} which was under control of the [[Comte de Marigny]]. De Marigny refused to surrender and was seriously wounded in the first five minutes. Command then fell to his captain, Captain Paul.<ref name=\"Fraser137\"/>\n[[File:Combat naval 12 avril 1782-Dumoulin-IMG 5486.JPG|thumb|left|Depiction of the battle by [[Fran\u00e7ois Aim\u00e9 Louis Dumoulin]]]]\n\nWith their formation shattered and many of their ships severely damaged, the French fell away to the southwest in small groups.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Rodney attempted to redeploy and make repairs before pursuing the French.<ref name=\"Gar1\"/> By 2pm, the wind had freshened and a general chase ensued. As the British pressed south, [[French ship Ardent (1764)|''Ardent'']]. After taking possession of ''Glorieux'' they caught up with the French rear at around 3pm. Admiral de Grasse signalled other ships to protect the ''Ville de Paris'', but this was only partially fulfilled. Nine ships from de Vaudreuil's squadron came to his aid. The British fleet bore down on this small group. In succession, Rodney's ships isolated the other three ships. ''C\u00e9sar'', which was soon totally dismasted and in flames, was captured by ''Centaur''.<ref name=roche>Roche, p.238</ref> Soon after 5pm the [[French ship Hector (1756)|Hector]] having been flanked by {{HMS|Canada|1765|6}} and {{HMS|Alcide|1779|6}} and soon became a complete dismasted wreck. Following the mortal wounding of its captain, De la Vicomte, his first lieutenant De Beaumanoir, lowered the ship's flag and surrendered to the ''Alcide''.<ref name=\"Fraser140\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=140}}</ref>\n\n[[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]], who commanded {{ship|French ship|Auguste|1778|2}}, had ordered eight ships of his own division<ref name=\"Trew\"/> to aid ''Ville de Paris'' but only the ''Ardent'' had proceeded and its isolation caused it to be flanked by HMS ''Belliqueux'' and HMS ''Prince William'' and this soon led to its capture.<ref name=\"Fraser143\"/>\n\nAt 5.30 pm, de Grasse with ''Ville de Paris'', stood practically alone and had ''Barfleur'' in close pursuit, and ''Formidable'' close behind. Five ships from de Vaudreuil's squadron were trying to protect her, but none in close formation. These were ''Triumphante'' (Vaudreuil's flagship), ''Bourgogne'' (under De La Charette), ''Magnifique'' (Macarty Macteigne), ''Pluton'' (De Rion) and ''Marseillais'' (De Castellane-Majastre). Three ships from De Grasse's squadron also still remained: ''Languedoc'', ''Couronne'' and ''Sceptre''.<ref name=\"Fraser143\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=143-44}}</ref>\n\nDe Grasse's closest protector the ''Couronne'', moved away at the approach of HMS ''Canada'', which began the final attack on the ''Ville de Paris''. With little support and suffering huge losses in men, made another attempt to signal the fleet and gave the order \"to build the line on the starboard [[Tacking (sailing)|tack]]\", but again this was not done.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/> By this time, most of the French fleet, apart from those ships that were surrounded, had retreated.\n\n===End of the battle===\nHMS ''Canada'' swept passed the ''Ville de Paris'' doing damage to the spars and slowing her further. HMS ''Russell'' under Captain Saumarez then moved diagonally along the stern of the flagship and fired a broadside which ripped the entire length of the ship. The Russell then moved to the leeward side to hamper the ship's retreat, whilst HMS ''Barfleur'' moved onto the opposite side. The ''Languedoc'' attempted to approach to give aid but was beaten back by HMS ''Duke''.<ref name=\"Fraser148\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=146-48}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Ville de Paris'' was in desperate condition with all masts damaged and the rudder shot away. At least 300 men were dead or injured in the cockpit. Around 6pm, being overwhelmed and suffering terrible losses, the ''Ville de Paris'' eventually [[Striking the colors|struck her colours]], signalling surrender.<ref name=\"troude155\">Troude, ''Batailles navales'', p. 155</ref> Hood approached on the ''Barfleur'', which de Grasse had indicated was his preferred method of surrender. In an ungentlemanly act Hood ordered one final broadside at close quarters, when de Grasse had already indicated surrender.<ref name=\"Fraser148\"/>\n\nThe boarding crew, which included the British fleet surgeon [[Gilbert Blane]], were horrified at the carnage;{{refn | name = nbBlane/Macintyre| group = lower-alpha |Blane noted, \"When boarded, ''Ville de Paris'' presented a scene of complete horror. The numbers killed were so great that the surviving, either from want of leisure, or through dismay, had not thrown the bodies of the killed overboard, so that the decks were covered with the blood and mangled limbs of the dead, as well as the wounded and dying\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Macintyre|first1=Donald|title=Admiral Rodney|date=1962|publisher=Norton|page=239}}</ref>}} Remarkably Admiral de Grasse appeared not to have a scratch on him, whilst every one of his officers had either been killed or wounded. Only three men were unwounded. Rodney boarded soon after, and Hood presented Grasse to him.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> With his surrender, the battle had effectively ended, except for a few long-range desultory shots and the retreat of many of the French ships in disorder.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/>\n\nThe [[Louis-Philippe de Vaudreuil|Comte de Vaudreuil]] in {{ship|French ship|Sceptre|1780|2}}, seeing Grasse's fate through his telescope, took command of the remaining scattered French naval fleet. On 13 April, he had ten ships with him and sailed toward [[Cap-Ha\u00eftien|Cap-Fran\u00e7ais]].<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Rodney signalled his fleet not to pursue the remaining ships. The battle was therefore over.<ref name=\"Fraser152\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=152}}</ref>\n\nLater that night, around 9pm, a fire begun by the entrapped French crew on the lower decks, breaking into the liquor store.

Disease took a hold of the French forces, in particular the soldiers, of whom thousands died. The allies hesitated, and indecision soon led to the abandonment of the attack on Jamaica.<ref name=\"Trew\"/>\n\nThe battle has been controversial, for three reasons:\n* Rodney's failure to follow up the victory by a pursuit was much criticised. Samuel Hood said that the 20 French ships would have been captured had the commander-in-chief maintained the chase. In 1899 the [[Navy Records Society]] published the ''Dispatches and Letters Relating to the Blockading of Brest''. In the introduction, they include a small biography of Admiral [[William Cornwallis]], who commanded the ''Canada'' at the Saintes. A poem purportedly written by him includes the lines:\n<center><blockquote>Had a chief worthy Britain commanded our fleet,<br />Twenty-five good French ships had been laid at our feet.<ref name=Leyland1899>{{cite book|last=Leyland|first =John|title=Dispatches and letters relating to the blockade of Brest, 1803\u20131805|publisher=Printed for the [[Navy Records Society]]|year=1899|isbn=|url =https://archive.org/details/dispatchesandle00leylgoog|page =xx}}</ref></blockquote></center>\n* The battle is famous for the innovative British tactic of \"breaking the line\", in which the British ships passed through a gap in the French line, engaging the enemy from leeward and throwing them into disorder.<ref name=\"O'Shaugh\"/> Historians disagree about whether the tactic was intentional or made possible by weather. And, if intentional, who should receive credit: Rodney{{refn | name = nbBlane| group = lower-alpha | ''According to [[dramatist]] [[Richard Cumberland (dramatist)|Richard Cumberland]], Rodney discussed breaking the line over dinner at Lord [[George Germain]]'s country residence at [[Buckhurst Park, Sussex|Stoneland]].

The Battle of the Saintes transferred the strategic initiative to the British. The most likely next military action would be an attack on the French sugar islands. The French were consequently inclined to ameliorate their terms. Britain's dominance at sea was reasserted. The Americans realized they were unlikely to have much French support in the future. [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Richard Howe]] gained relief of the [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|Siege of Gibraltar]] by defeating the huge Franco-Spanish assault; the siege was subsequently lifted in February 1783.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/> Initial articles of peace were [[Peace of Paris (1783)|signed in July]], with a [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|full treaty]] following in September 1783.\n\nAs a result of the battle, British naval tactics changed. The old method involved the attacking fleet spreading itself along the entire enemy line. In the five formal fleet actions involving the Royal Navy between the Battle of the Saintes and [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]], all were victories for the British, which were achieved by the

The French fleet had the year before blockaded the [[British Army during the American War of Independence|British Army]] at Chesapeake Bay during the [[Siege of Yorktown]] and supported the eventual American victory in their revolution.\n\nThe French suffered heavy casualties at the Saintes and many were taken prisoner, including the admiral, Comte de Grasse. Four French ships of the line were captured (including the [[flagship]]) and one was destroyed. Rodney was credited with pioneering the tactic of \"[[Naval tactics in the Age of Sail|breaking the line]]\" in the battle, though this is disputed.<ref name=\"O'Shaugh\"/><ref>Valin p.67-68</ref>\n\n==Background==\nIn October 1781, Admiral Comte de Grasse, commander of the French fleet in the West Indies; [[Francisco Saavedra de Sangronis]], General Bureau for the Spanish Indies; and [[Bernardo de G\u00e1lvez]], court representative and aide to the Spanish [[Governor of Louisiana]], developed a plan against British forces. The strategic objectives of the Franco-Spanish military forces in the West Indies in this plan were:\n* to aid the Americans and defeat the British naval squadron at [[New York City|New York]]\n* to capture the British [[Windward Islands]] and\n* to conquer Jamaica.<ref>Dull p. 244</ref>\n\nThis plan became known as the \"De Grasse \u2013 Saavedra Convention\". The first objective was essentially met by the surrender of the British army under [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|General Cornwallis]] at the [[Siege of Yorktown]] in September 1781. De Grasse and his fleet [[Battle of the Chesapeake|played a decisive part]] in that victory, after which they returned to the Caribbean. On arrival in [[Saint Domingue]] in November 1781, the admiral was notified to proceed with a plan for the conquest of Jamaica.<ref>Dull p. 248-49</ref>\n\nJamaica was the largest and most profitable British island in the Caribbean, mainly because of [[sugar]]; it was more valuable to the British economy than all of the thirteen American colonies. [[King George III]] wrote to [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich|Lord Sandwich]], saying that he would risk protecting Britain's important Caribbean islands at the risk of Britain herself, and this was the strategy implemented in 1779.<ref>O'Shaughnessy p. 208</ref> Sugar made up 20% of all British imports and was worth five times as much as [[tobacco]].<ref>Rogozi\u0144ski p. 115</ref> The French and Spanish were fighting to take over Jamaica in order to expel the British from the West Indies, and to strike a massive blow against the British economy.<ref>Trew p. 154-55</ref> The courts at [[Paris]] and [[Madrid]] perceived the invasion of Jamaica as an alternative to the [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|Spanish and French attempts to take Gibraltar]], which for two years had been a costly disaster.<ref>Dull p. 282</ref>\n\nWhile de Grasse waited for reinforcements to undertake the Jamaica campaign, he [[Siege of Brimstone Hill|captured St. Kitts]] in February 1782. The rest of the [[Windward Islands]] - [[Antigua]], [[St Lucia]], and [[Barbados]] - still remained under British control. Admiral George Rodney arrived in the Caribbean theatre the following month, bringing reinforcements. These included seventeen ships of the line and gave the British a slight numerical advantage.<ref name=\"Trew\">Trew p. 157-62</ref>\n\nOn 7 April 1782, de Grasse set out from [[Martinique]] with 35 [[ships of the line]], including two 50-gun ships and a large convoy of more than 100 cargo ships, to meet with a Spanish fleet of 12 ships of the line. In addition, de Grasse was to rendezvous with 15,000 troops at Saint Domingue, who were earmarked for the conquest and intended to land on Jamaica's north coast.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Rodney, on learning of this, sailed from [[St Lucia]] in pursuit with 36 [[ships of the line]] the following day.<ref name=\"Mahan1\">Mahan. p. 205\u2212226</ref>\n\nThe British [[Hull (watercraft)|hulls]] by this time had been given [[copper sheathing]] to protect them from [[barnacle|marine growth]] and [[biofouling|fouling]], as well as salt water corrosion.

As was the convention of the day the fleet was split into three sections: Rodney had individual control as [[Admiral of the White]] of 12 ships flying the [[White Ensign]]; Drake had command of 12 ships flying the [[Blue Ensign]] as [[Admiral of the Blue]]; Hood was [[Admiral of the Red]] with 12 ships flying the [[Red Ensign]].<ref name=\"Fraser102\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=102}}</ref>\n\nThe Formidable was accompanied by three 98-gun ships: [[HMS Barfleur (1768)|HMS ''Barfleur'']] (commanded by Hood), [[HMS Prince George (1772)|HMS ''Prince George'']] and [[HMS Duke (1777)|HMS ''Duke'']] plus the 90-gun [[HMS Namur (1756)|HMS ''Namur'']]. The remaining 31 ships ranged from 64-gun to 74-gun. In total the British fleet had 2620 guns compared to the French total of 2526. Most of the British fleet was equipped with [[carronade]]s on the upper decks, which had a major advantage of flexibility, and were a great advantage at close quarters.<ref name=\"Fraser102\"/>\n\nIn March 1782, ''Formidable'' was stationed at Gros Islet Bay between the island of [[St. Lucia]] in the [[West Indies]] and [[Pigeon Island (Saint Lucia)|Pigeon Island]]. It was under the command of Admiral [[George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney|Admiral Rodney]], serving as his flagship at the head of 36 [[ship of the line]]. Meanwhile the French admiral, [[Fran\u00e7ois Joseph Paul de Grasse|De Grasse]], headed 34 ship of the line at Fort Royal Bay in [[Martinique]]. Rodney had been dispatched from Britain with 12 well-fitted ships to rescue the West Indies from a series of attacks from the French which had already resulted in the loss of several islands. They joined 24 ships on St Lucia which had already seen action against the French and were undergoing repairs.<ref name=\"Fraser102\"/>\n\nThe French had allies in the Spanish, who had 13 ship of the line at [[Cape Haitien]] in [[San Domingo]]. Together with transport ships the Spanish had a considerable force of 24,000 men. They awaited the arrival of a further 10,000 French troops dispatched from [[Brest, France|Brest]], under escort of five men-of-war, to further boost their strength. The plan was that de Grasse's fleet, with at least 5000 further troops, would unite with the Spanish at Cape Haitien, and from there would attack and capture the island of [[Jamaica]] with their conjoined armada of some 60 ships and some 40,000 troops.\n\nRodney had been in communication with De Grasse during March organising the exchange of prisoners, which were conveyed by [[HMS Alert (1779)|HMS ''Alert'']] under Captain Vashon. The two officers had much mutual respect. Rodney's task was to intercept the French fleet en route to Cape Haitien.\n\nDe Grasse's vice admiral at the time was [[Louis-Philippe de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil]]. Third in command was [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]]. The French flagship was the huge 104-gun [[French ship Ville de Paris (1764)|Ville de Paris]]. The troops were under the command of the [[Marquis de Bouille]]. The French fleet was also split into three squadrons: De Grasse led the \"Cornette Blanche\"; Bougainville led the \"Escadre Bleu\"; de Vaudreuil as a second-in-command flew the mixed blue and white colours of the \"Blanche et Bleu\".<ref name=\"Fraser102\"/>\n\nOther British commanders included [[Lord Robert Manners (Royal Navy officer)|Lord Robert Manners]] of [[HMS Resolution (1770)|HMS ''Resolution'']]. Admiral [[William Cornwallis]] was in command of [[HMS Canada (1765)|HMS ''Canada'']]. [[HMS Monarch (1765)|HMS ''Monarch'']] was under the command of [[Francis Reynolds-Moreton, 3rd Baron Ducie|Captain Reynolds]]. Other aristocrats present included [[James Cranstoun, 8th Lord Cranstoun|Captain Lord Cranstoun]] on the ''Formidable''. Sir Charles Douglas, a nephew of [[Charles Douglas, 3rd Duke of Queensberry]], was Captain of the Fleet. [[James Wallace (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Wallace]] was also present. Other commanders included Captains Inglefield, Parry, Dumaresq, Buckner, Graves, Blair, Burnett, Savage, Symons, Charrington, Inglis, Cornish, Truscott, Saumarez, Knight, Wilson, Williams and Wilkinson.<ref name=\"Fraser72\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=72}}</ref>\n\nA look-out squadron, a line of frigates headed by Captain [[George Anson Byron]] on [[HMS Andromache (1781)|HMS ''Andromache'']], reported all of de Grasse's movements at Fort Royal.

On 5 April it was reported that the French troops were boarding the ships. At 8am on Sunday 8 April it was reported that the French fleet were leaving Fort Royal. Rodney's fleet called all men to join their ships and ships began leaving Gros Islet Bay at 10.30am.<ref name=\"Fraser80\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=80-81}}</ref>\n\nThe total French armada comprised 35 [[ship of the line]], 10 [[frigate]]s, and over 100 smaller ships. The smaller ships moved in advance of the men-of-war, heading for [[St. Pierre, Martinique|St Pierre]].<ref name=\"Fraser80\"/>\n\nJust past 4pm HMS ''Barfleur'' (under Hood) at the head of the British fleet espied 5 sails ahead which she presumed to be part of the French fleet. These came into view of the Formidable around two hours later, just before sunset. They pursued the French through the night. At 2am on 9 April [[HMS St Albans (1764)|HMS ''St Albans'']] dropped alongside Formidable, reporting that she, along with [[HMS Valiant (1759)|HMS ''Valiant'']], had located the French fleet in the darkness. Rodney rested for the remainder of the night.\n\nThe sun rose at 5.30am. The French fleet extended from 6 miles to 12 miles distant, navigating the waters between [[Dominica]] and [[Guadeloupe]]. The majority of the warships lay off [[Prince Rupert's Bay]].\n\nDue to a [[dead calm]] from 3am until 7am neither fleet could move. The initial wind only reached the ''Barfleur'' and its eight support ships, causing it to detach ahead of the main fleet, which lay in the [[Lee side|lee]] of Dominica. De Grasse saw the opportunity to cripple this advanced section and wheeled to begin the first attack.\n\n== Battle ==\nOn 9 April 1782, the copper-sheathed British fleet caught up with the French, who were surprised by their speed.<ref name\"Stevens173\">Stevens p. 173</ref> Admiral de Grasse ordered the French convoy to head into [[Guadeloupe]] for repair, forcing him to escort two fifty-gun ships (''Fier'' and ''Experiment''), and placing his fleet in line of battle in order to cover the retreat.<ref name=\"Stevens173\">{{Harvnb|Allen|2009|p=173}}</ref>\n\n===First encounters===\nHood's section of the fleet, headed by [[HMS Barfleur (1768)|HMS ''Barfleur'']], braced for the first attack. [[HMS Alfred (1778)|HMS Alfred]] taunted the 18 French ships under de Vaudreuil which approached, as the first action, by exposing her broadside to the approaching French but without consequence. The British patiently awaited the formal signal from Rodney on the Formidable, some six miles behind, and eventually received a red flag signal telling them to \"engage the enemy\". As the wind rose around noon it enabled most of the French fleet and part of the British fleet (including Rodney in the ''Formidable'') joined the melee. At this point the French outnumbered the British two to one.<ref name=\"Fraser86\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=86-89}}</ref> Captain William Bayne on the Alfred was killed during this action.<ref name=\"Fraser111\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=111}}</ref>\n\nAfter an inconclusive encounter in which both sides suffered damage, Grasse realised that the remainder of the British fleet would soon be upon them. He broke off the engagement to withdraw a safe distance.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Grasse moved his ships to the [[Saintes islands]] to the north (south of [[Gaudeloupe]]. Meanwhile Rodney reversed the order of his line to bring Drake's thus far undamaged ships to the front, and allow Hood to undertake repairs in the rear lines.<ref name=\"Fraser90\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=90-92}}</ref>\n\nOn 10 April the French began 10 miles distant but did not turn to engage, but instead continued on their original course. By nightfall that increased their separation to 15 miles. This appears partly due to a wrong presumption on Rodney's part that the French were going to turn to engage.<ref name=\"Fraser90\"/>\n\nOn Wednesday 11 April two French ships (the {{ship|French ship|Z\u00e9l\u00e9|1764|2}} and the [[French ship Magnanime (1779)|''Magnanime'']]) which had accidentally collided, and had fallen behind the main French fleet, came into view around noon. Rodney decided that attacking these two ships would cause de Grasse to return to protect them. This tactic worked and a large section of the French fleet turned to protect the pair. These movements were done without any physical attacks.<ref name=\"Fraser90\"/>\n\n===Main engagement===\n[[File:Battle of the Saintes plan.jpg|thumb|300px|Main stages of the battle]]\nOn 12 April, the French were ranged from 6 miles to 12 miles distant and were not in formation, as the two fleets manoeuvred between the northern end of Dominica and the Saintes, in what is known as the Saintes Passage. The unfortunate ''Z\u00e9l\u00e9'' had had a second collision during the night with one of its rescuers, the [[French ship Ville de Paris (1764)|''Ville de Paris'']]. It was now being towed to Basse Terre in Guadeloupe by [[French ship Astr\u00e9e|Astr\u00e9e]] (with [[Fran\u00e7ois Claude Amour, marquis de Bouill\u00e9|General de Bouille]] on board. They was chased by four British ships: [[HMS Monarch (1765)|''Monarch'']], [[HMS Valiant (1759)|''Valiant'']], [[HMS Centaur (1759)|''Centaur'']] and [[HMS Belliqueux (1780)|''Belliqueux'']]. De Grasse made for [[Guadeloupe]] and [[Glossary of nautical terms#B|bore up]] with his fleet to protect the ship and at the same time Rodney recalled his chasing ships and made the signal for [[line of battle]].<ref name=\"Mahan2\">Mahan p. 194\u2212221</ref>\n\nRear-Admiral Hood's van division were still making repairs from the action three days earlier, so he directed his rear division, under Rear Admiral [[Sir Francis Samuel Drake, 1st Baronet|Francis S. Drake]], to take the lead. At 7:40, {{HMS|Marlborough|1767|6}}, under Captain [[Taylor Penny]], led the British line and opened battle when he approached the centre of the French line.<ref name=\"Lavery\"/> Having remained parallel with the French, the ships of Drake's division passed the remaining length of de Grasse's line and the two sides exchanged [[broadside]]s, a typical naval engagement of this time.<ref name=\"Trew\"/>\n\n==== Initial attack ====\n[[HMS Marlborough (1767)|HMS ''Marlborough'']] under Captain [[Taylor Penny]] of [[Dorset]] headed the British attack.<ref name=\"Fraser103\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=103-05}}</ref>\n\nAs the battle progressed, the strong winds of the previous day and night began to temper and became more variable. As the French line passed down the British line, the sudden shift of wind let Rodney's flagship {{HMS|Formidable|1777|6}} and several other ships, including {{HMS|Duke|1777|6}} and {{HMS|Bedford|1775|6}}, sail toward the French line.<ref>Tanstall, Brian. ''Naval Warfare in the Age of Sail: the Evolution of Fighting Tactics 1680\u20141815''. Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, MD, 1990. p. 308. {{ISBN|1-55750-601-9}}</ref>\n\nAt 8 am, ''Formidable'' raised the red flag to permit the ''Marlborough'' to open fire and engage the French. At this point the ''Marlborough'' was opposite the [[French ship Dauphin Royal (1735)|''Dauphin Royal'']] who received her full broadside.<ref name=\"Fraser103\"/> Sixteen ships in line separated the ''Marlborough'' from the ''Formidable'' and each stood 200 metres apart. As each circled passed the French they fired a broadside against the French. Second, behind ''Marlborough'' was [[HMS Arrogant (1761)|HMS ''Arrogant'']] which had been recently re-equipped, managed three broadsides against one from the French as they passed. Third in line was [[HMS Alcide (1779)|HMS ''Alcide'']] under Captain Charles Thomson. Then followed [[HMS Nonsuch (1774)|HMS ''Nonsuch'']] under Captain Truscott then [[HMS Conqueror (1773)|HMS ''Conqueror'']] under Captain George Balfour.<ref name=\"Fraser103\"/>\n\nNext in line was Admiral Drake on HMS ''Princessa'' who was in command of the first twelve vessels and was followed by [[HMS Prince George (1772)|HMS ''Prince George'']] under Captain Williams. Then came the hundred year old [[HMS Neptune (1683)|HMS ''Torbay'']] under Captain Keppel and the year-old [[HMS Anson (1781)|HMS ''Anson'']] under Captain William Blair, who being on the main deck was struck by round shot at waist level and horrifically sliced in two. The blue squadron was then completed by [[HMS Fame (1759)|HMS ''Fame'']] and [[HMS Russell (1764)|HMS ''Russell'']] under Captain [[James Saumarez]].<ref name=\"Fraser107\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=107}}</ref>\n\nThe white squadron under Rodney followed in exact formation after the blue. This was headed by [[HMS America (1777)|HMS ''America'']] under Captain Thompson. [[HMS Hercules (1759)|HMS ''Hercules'']] under Captain Henry Savage followed. Then came [[HMS Prothee (1780)|HMS ''Prothee'']] under Captain Buckner and [[HMS Resolution (1770)|HMS ''Resolution'']] under [[Lord Robert Manners (Royal Navy officer)|Captain Robert Manners]]. The 24-year-old Manners was the first casualty on his ship, and was severely injured in both legs and right arm and later died of these wounds.<ref name=\"Fraser110\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=110-11}}</ref> ''Resolution'' was followed by HMS ''Duke'' under [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Captain Alan Gardner]].<ref name=\"Fraser110\"/>\n\nAs ''Formidable'' was in the centre of the British line it took her almost an hour to reach the centre of the action. All ships had to maintain a steady speed  and a she passed de Grasse's flagship, ''Ville de Paris'' of 104 guns the two met for the first time. The ''Ville de Paris'' was already damaged by the  fifteen ships ahead of ''Formidable'' in the line. Although it was a sunny day the smoke of the battle was like a dense fog.<ref name=\"Fraser113\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=113}}</ref> ''Formidable'' entered the smoke and approached the ''Ville de Paris'' at 8.40am.<ref name=\"Fraser117\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=117-19}}</ref>\n\nThe counter movement of the fleets brought a series of ships opposite the ''Formidable'' in sequence behind the ''Ville de Paris'', the movements bringing about a different pairing of enemies every five minutes. Next was [[French ship \u00c7a Ira (1781)|''Couronne'']], followed by [[French ship \u00c9veill\u00e9 (1752)|''\u00c9veill\u00e9'']] under Le Gardeur de Tilly then the [[French ship Sceptre (1780)|''Sceptre'']] under the command of de Vaudreuil.<ref name=\"Fraser117\"/>\n\n====Breaking the Line====\nWithin an hour, the wind had shifted to the south, forcing the French line to separate and bear to the west, as it could not hold its course into the wind. This allowed the British to use their guns on both sides of their ships without any fear of return fire from the front and rear of the French ships they were passing between. The effect was greater with the use of [[carronade]]s, with which the British had just equipped nearly half their fleet; this relatively new short-range weapon was quicker to reload and more of them could be carried. {{HMS|Glorieux||2}} moving in the wake of the ''Ville de Paris'' under command of Captain D'Escars was the next victim; virtually a sitting duck due to damage in the previous ten minutes from HMS Duke, she was quickly pounded and dismasted by intense fire. In the confusion, four French ships beginning with [[French ship Diad\u00e8me (1756)|''Diadem'']] broke out of sequence (partly due to the uncontrollable speed of the mastless ''Glorieux''). ''Formidable'' turned to starboard and brought her port guns to bear on them.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> As a result, ''Formidable'' sailed through the gap, breaking the French line. This breach was further followed through by five other British ships.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/> The breach was later recorded by [[Charles Dashwood (Royal Navy officer)|Charles Dashwood]] who was a midshipman on the ''Formidable'' on the day.<ref name=\"Fraser123\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=123}}</ref>\n[[File:Battle-of-the-Saintes-12th-April-1782-William-Elliott-1784-871.jpg|thumb|330px|''Lord Rodney\u2019s flagship ''Formidable'' breaking through the French line at the battle of the Saintes, 12th  1782''; painted by [[William Elliott (lieutenant)|William Elliott]]]]\n\nAlthough the concept of \"breaking the line\" was born here, the concept is logically of mixed blessings, since in breaking the enemy line, one breaks one's own line. Whilst the movement has the advantage that guns can be fired on both port and starboard sides, it also exposes the ship to attack on both sides. The advantage in this instance was that many of the French gunners left their post, in fear of the ''Formidable''s three tiers of guns bearing down on them.<ref name=\"Fraser126\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=126}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Diadem'' appears to have fully withdrawn from the battle at this stage, and many presumed her to be sunk. The ''Formidable'' was followed by [[HMS Namur (1756)|HMS ''Namur'']] under [[Robert Fanshawe (Royal Navy officer)|Captain Fanshawe]], then [[HMS St Albans (1764)|HMS ''St Albans'']] under [[Charles Inglis (c. 1731-1791)|Captain Inglis]]. These were followed by the deadly [[HMS Canada (1765)|HMS ''Canada'']] under Captain [[William Cornwallis]], [[HMS Repulse (1780)|HMS ''Repulse'']] under Captain Thomas Dumaresq, and [[HMS Ajax (1765)|HMS ''Ajax'']] under Captain Nicholas Charrington. Each of these fired further upon the hapless and already crippled ''Glorieux''.<ref name=\"Fraser122\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=122}}</ref>\n\nSimultaneously, by accident of the smoke, Commodore [[Edmund Affleck]] on [[HMS Bedford (1775)|HMS ''Bedford'']], the hindmost ship of the central white squadron, accidentally sailed through the confused French line, between [[French ship C\u00e9sar (1768)|''Cesar'']] and [[French ship Hector (1756)|''Hector'']], only discovering this error when no enemy lay on his starboard side in the clearing smoke.<ref name=\"Fraser130\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=130-33}}</ref>\n \nThe ''Bedford'' was followed by Hood's red squadron and this broke the French line into three sections. In the confusion the two leading ships of the rear red squadron, [[HMS Prince William (1780)|HMS ''Prince William'']] and [[HMS Magnificent (1766)|HMS ''Magnificent'']] had somehow passed the ''Bedford'', who was now third in line within the red squadron, completely detached from its own white squadron.<ref name=\"Fraser130\"/> The whole red squadron then passed between ''Cesar'' and ''Hector'', causing each to be crippled. The final ship of the red squadron, [[HMS Royal Oak (1769)|HMS ''Royal Oak'']], passed the stern of the ''Cesar'' and delivered a final blow a few minutes after 11am. Both fleets then drifted apart for some time and became temporarily becalmed.<ref name=\"Fraser130\"/>\n\nAround noon, to the horror of both fleets, it was spotted that the waters were teaming with sharks attracted by the noise and blood. French casualties were greatly increased due to the high number of troops packed onto the lower decks: a minimum of 900 per ship and no less than 1300 on the ''Ville de Paris''. In order to lessen the confusion the French had been throwing the dead (and perhaps the near dead) overboard, and this was a rich feast for the sharks.<ref name=\"Fraser130\"/>\n\n===French flight===\n[[File:The Battle of the Saints, 12 April 1782 RMG BHC0444.tiff|thumb|''Battle of the Saintes April 1782'' by [[Nicholas Pocock]]]]\nThe French now lay totally to the leeward of the British fleet and the fleet stood between them and their destination. They had little option on the re-emergence of the wind but to sail west with the wind, and try to escape. At 1pm the former British ship [[HMS Richmond (1757)|HMS ''Richmond'']], now renamed ''Richemont'', under command of Captain De Mortemart but with [[Denis Decr\u00e8s]] in charge of the marines, was sent to join a towing cable to the heavily crippled ''Glorieux''. [[French ship Souverain|''Souverain'']] moved alongside to provide covering fire. However the British, with both wind and cannon-power in their favour, moved a number of ships up to block this movement. The captain of the ''Glorieux'' was already dead, and she was under command of the senior officer remaining: Lieutenant Trogoff de Kerlessi. The ''Souverain'' and ''Richmond'' retreated under heavy fire and Kerlessi had little option but to tear the flag from the mast and surrender, which was done to the ''Royal Oak''. Captain Burnett used this opportunity to restock his depleted powder supplies. Meanwhile HMS ''Monarch'' stood alongside [[HMS Andromache (1781)|HMS ''Andromache'']] who was acting as a supply ship to the British fleet, and forty barrels of powder were exchanged.<ref name=\"Fraser137\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=137-38}}</ref>\n\nIn the next action, around 1.30, {{HMS|Centaur|1759|6}} and ''[[HMS Bedford]]'' attacked the stricken {{ship|French ship|C\u00e9sar|1768|2}} which was under control of the [[Comte de Marigny]]. De Marigny refused to surrender and was seriously wounded in the first five minutes. Command then fell to his captain, Captain Paul.<ref name=\"Fraser137\"/>\n[[File:Combat naval 12 avril 1782-Dumoulin-IMG 5486.JPG|thumb|left|Depiction of the battle by [[Fran\u00e7ois Aim\u00e9 Louis Dumoulin]]]]\n\nWith their formation shattered and many of their ships severely damaged, the French fell away to the southwest in small groups.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Rodney attempted to redeploy and make repairs before pursuing the French.<ref name=\"Gar1\"/> By 2pm, the wind had freshened and a general chase ensued. As the British pressed south, [[French ship Ardent (1764)|''Ardent'']]. After taking possession of ''Glorieux'' they caught up with the French rear at around 3pm. Admiral de Grasse signalled other ships to protect the ''Ville de Paris'', but this was only partially fulfilled. Nine ships from de Vaudreuil's squadron came to his aid. The British fleet bore down on this small group. In succession, Rodney's ships isolated the other three ships. ''C\u00e9sar'', which was soon totally dismasted and in flames, was captured by ''Centaur''.<ref name=roche>Roche, p.238</ref> Soon after 5pm the [[French ship Hector (1756)|Hector]] having been flanked by {{HMS|Canada|1765|6}} and {{HMS|Alcide|1779|6}} and soon became a complete dismasted wreck. Following the mortal wounding of its captain, De la Vicomte, his first lieutenant De Beaumanoir, lowered the ship's flag and surrendered to the ''Alcide''.<ref name=\"Fraser140\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=140}}</ref>\n\n[[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]], who commanded {{ship|French ship|Auguste|1778|2}}, had ordered eight ships of his own division<ref name=\"Trew\"/> to aid ''Ville de Paris'' but only the ''Ardent'' had proceeded and its isolation caused it to be flanked by HMS ''Belliqueux'' and HMS ''Prince William'' and this soon led to its capture.<ref name=\"Fraser143\"/>\n\nAt 5.30 pm, de Grasse with ''Ville de Paris'', stood practically alone and had ''Barfleur'' in close pursuit, and ''Formidable'' close behind. Five ships from de Vaudreuil's squadron were trying to protect her, but none in close formation. These were ''Triumphante'' (Vaudreuil's flagship), ''Bourgogne'' (under De La Charette), ''Magnifique'' (Macarty Macteigne), ''Pluton'' (De Rion) and ''Marseillais'' (De Castellane-Majastre). Three ships from De Grasse's squadron also still remained: ''Languedoc'', ''Couronne'' and ''Sceptre''.<ref name=\"Fraser143\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=143-44}}</ref>\n\nDe Grasse's closest protector the ''Couronne'', moved away at the approach of HMS ''Canada'', which began the final attack on the ''Ville de Paris''. With little support and suffering huge losses in men, made another attempt to signal the fleet and gave the order \"to build the line on the starboard [[Tacking (sailing)|tack]]\", but again this was not done.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/> By this time, most of the French fleet, apart from those ships that were surrounded, had retreated.\n\n===End of the battle===\nHMS ''Canada'' swept passed the ''Ville de Paris'' doing damage to the spars and slowing her further. HMS ''Russell'' under Captain Saumarez then moved diagonally along the stern of the flagship and fired a broadside which ripped the entire length of the ship. The Russell then moved to the leeward side to hamper the ship's retreat, whilst HMS ''Barfleur'' moved onto the opposite side. The ''Languedoc'' attempted to approach to give aid but was beaten back by HMS ''Duke''.<ref name=\"Fraser148\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=146-48}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Ville de Paris'' was in desperate condition with all masts damaged and the rudder shot away. At least 300 men were dead or injured in the cockpit. Around 6pm, being overwhelmed and suffering terrible losses, the ''Ville de Paris'' eventually [[Striking the colors|struck her colours]], signalling surrender.<ref name=\"troude155\">Troude, ''Batailles navales'', p. 155</ref> Hood approached on the ''Barfleur'', which de Grasse had indicated was his preferred method of surrender. In an ungentlemanly act Hood ordered one final broadside at close quarters, when de Grasse had already indicated surrender.<ref name=\"Fraser148\"/>\n\nThe boarding crew, which included the British fleet surgeon [[Gilbert Blane]], were horrified at the carnage;{{refn | name = nbBlane/Macintyre| group = lower-alpha |Blane noted, \"When boarded, ''Ville de Paris'' presented a scene of complete horror.

Only three men were unwounded. Rodney boarded soon after, and Hood presented Grasse to him.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> With his surrender, the battle had effectively ended, except for a few long-range desultory shots and the retreat of many of the French ships in disorder.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/>\n\nThe [[Louis-Philippe de Vaudreuil|Comte de Vaudreuil]] in {{ship|French ship|Sceptre|1780|2}}, seeing Grasse's fate through his telescope, took command of the remaining scattered French naval fleet. On 13 April, he had ten ships with him and sailed toward [[Cap-Ha\u00eftien|Cap-Fran\u00e7ais]].<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Rodney signalled his fleet not to pursue the remaining ships. The battle was therefore over.<ref name=\"Fraser152\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=152}}</ref>\n\nLater that night, around 9pm, a fire begun by the entrapped French crew on the lower decks, breaking into the liquor store. By 10.30pm, and now out of control, the [[Gunpowder magazine|magazine]] aboard the ''C\u00e9sar'' exploded, killing more than 400 French and 58 British sailors, plus the lieutenant in charge, all from HMS ''Centaur'', although many men jumped overboard trying to avoid the disaster.<ref name=\"Gar1\"/> Those jumping overboard met a more horrible fate, due to the sharks below.

Disease took a hold of the French forces, in particular the soldiers, of whom thousands died. The allies hesitated, and indecision soon led to the abandonment of the attack on Jamaica.<ref name=\"Trew\"/>\n\nThe battle has been controversial, for three reasons:\n* Rodney's failure to follow up the victory by a pursuit was much criticised. Samuel Hood said that the 20 French ships would have been captured had the commander-in-chief maintained the chase. In 1899 the [[Navy Records Society]] published the ''Dispatches and Letters Relating to the Blockading of Brest''. In the introduction, they include a small biography of Admiral [[William Cornwallis]], who commanded the ''Canada'' at the Saintes. A poem purportedly written by him includes the lines:\n<center><blockquote>Had a chief worthy Britain commanded our fleet,<br />Twenty-five good French ships had been laid at our feet.<ref name=Leyland1899>{{cite book|last=Leyland|first =John|title=Dispatches and letters relating to the blockade of Brest, 1803\u20131805|publisher=Printed for the [[Navy Records Society]]|year=1899|isbn=|url =https://archive.org/details/dispatchesandle00leylgoog|page =xx}}</ref></blockquote></center>\n* The battle is famous for the innovative British tactic of \"breaking the line\", in which the British ships passed through a gap in the French line, engaging the enemy from leeward and throwing them into disorder.<ref name=\"O'Shaugh\"/> Historians disagree about whether the tactic was intentional or made possible by weather. And, if intentional, who should receive credit: Rodney{{refn | name = nbBlane| group = lower-alpha | ''According to [[dramatist]] [[Richard Cumberland (dramatist)|Richard Cumberland]], Rodney discussed breaking the line over dinner at Lord [[George Germain]]'s country residence at [[Buckhurst Park, Sussex|Stoneland]].

He was created a [[Peerage|peer]] with \u00a32,000 a year settled on the title in perpetuity for this victory. Hood was elevated to the peerage as well, while Drake and Affleck were made [[baronet]]s.<ref name=\"Mahan2\"/>\n\nFollowing the Franco-American [[Siege of Yorktown|victory at Yorktown]] the previous year, and the [[Second Rockingham Ministry|change of Government]] in England, peace negotiations among Britain, the American colonies, France, and Spain had begun in early 1782. The Battle of the Saintes transferred the strategic initiative to the British. The most likely next military action would be an attack on the French sugar islands. The French were consequently inclined to ameliorate their terms. Britain's dominance at sea was reasserted. The Americans realized they were unlikely to have much French support in the future. [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Richard Howe]] gained relief of the [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|Siege of Gibraltar]] by defeating the huge Franco-Spanish assault; the siege was subsequently lifted in February 1783.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/> Initial articles of peace were [[Peace of Paris (1783)|signed in July]], with a [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|full treaty]] following in September 1783.\n\nAs a result of the battle, British naval tactics changed. The old method involved the attacking fleet spreading itself along the entire enemy line. In the five formal fleet actions involving the Royal Navy between the Battle of the Saintes and [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]], all were victories for the British, which were achieved by the creation of localised numerical superiority.<ref name=\"Willis\">{{cite book |last1=Willis |first1=Sam |title=Fighting at Sea in the Eighteenth Century: The Art of Sailing Warfare |date=2008

This makes them ideal in photovoltaic cells used to turn sunlight into electricity, promising much more efficient solar power.\n*Nir Tessler leads a group on organic photovoltaic material.\n*Gitti Frey specializes in organic electronics - plastic electronics that are functional electronically and optically. They emit light and can transmit electrical signals, or absorb light and generate energy such as electricity. Frey introduces whole new properties in this field, creating effective and useful self-organizing structures on the nano-scale. Frey is working on a solar cell to convert sunlight into electrical energy.

Raynouard's]] brilliant defence of the order. The challenge was taken up, among others, by the famous orientalist Friedrich von Hammer-Purgstall, who in 1818 published his ''Mysterium Baphometis revelatum'', an attempt to prove that the Templars followed the doctrines and rites of the Gnostic Ophites, the argument being fortified with reproductions of obscene representations of supposed Gnostic ceremonies and of mystic symbols said to have been found in the Templars' buildings. Wilcke, while rejecting Hammer's main conclusions as unproved, argued in favour of the existence of a secret doctrine based, not on Gnosticism, but on the unitarianism of Islam, of which Baphomet (Mahomet) was the symbol. On the other hand, Wilhelm Havemann (''Geschichte des Ausganges des Tempelherrenordens, Stuttgart and T\u00fcbingen'', 1846) decided in favour of the innocence of the order.

Yes, in our profound conviction, the Grand Masters of the Order of Templars worshipped the Baphomet, and caused it to be worshipped by their initiates; yes, there existed in the past, and there may be still in the present, assemblies which are presided over by this figure, seated on a throne and having a flaming torch between the horns. But the adorers of this sign do not consider, as do we, that it is a representation of the devil; on the contrary, for them it is that of the god Pan, the god of our modern schools of philosophy, the god of the Alexandrian theurgic school and of our own mystical Neoplatonists, the god of Lamartine and Victor Cousin, the god of Spinoza and Plato, the god of the primitive Gnostic schools; the Christ also of the dissident priesthood.... The mysteries of the Sabbath have been variously described, but they figure always in grimoires and in magical trials; the revelations made on the subject may be classified under three heads\u20141. those referring to a fantastic and imaginary Sabbath; 2. those which betray the secrets of the occult assemblies of veritable adepts; 3. revelations of foolish and criminal gatherings, having for their object the operations of black magic.<ref>L\u00e9vi, trans.

It has been pointed out that these debates included contemporary forms of [[Romanticism|Romantic]] [[socialism]], or [[Utopian socialism]], which were seen as the heirs of the Gnostics, Templars, and other mystics. L\u00e9vi, being himself an adherent of these schools since the 1840s, regarded the socialists and Romantics (such as Lamartine) as the successors of this alleged tradition of true religion. In fact, his narrative mirrors historiographies of socialism, including the ''Histoire des Montagnards'' (1847) by his best friend and political comrade [[Alphonse Esquiros]]. Consequently, the Baphomet is depicted by L\u00e9vi as the symbol of a revolutionary heretical tradition that would soon lead to the \"emancipation of humanity\" and the establishment of a perfect social order.<ref name=Strube/>\n\nIn L\u00e9vi's writings, the Baphomet does not only express a historical-political tradition, but also occult natural forces that are explained by his magical theory of the Astral Light. He developed this notion in the context of what has been called \"spiritualist magnetism\": theories that stressed the religious implications of magnetism. Often, their representatives were socialists that believed in the social consequences of a \"synthesis\" of religion and science that was to be achieved by the means of magnetism.<ref name=Strube/> Spiritualist magnetists with a socialist background include the [[Baron du Potet]] and Henri Delaage, who served as main sources for L\u00e9vi. At the same time, L\u00e9vi polemicized against famed Catholic authors such as Jules-Eudes de Mirville and [[Roger Gougenot des Mousseaux]] who regarded magnetism as the workings of demons and other infernal powers.<ref name=Strube/> The paragraph just before the passage cited in the previous section has to be seen against this background:\n\n{{quote|Let us state now for the edification of the vulgar, for the satisfaction of M. le Comte de Mirville, for the justification of the demonologist Bodin, for the greater glory of the Church, which persecuted Templars, burnt magicians, excommunicated Freemasons, &c. let us state boldly and precisely that all the inferior initiates of the occult sciences and profaners of the great arcanum, not only did in the past, but do now, and will ever, adore what is signified by this alarming symbol.<ref>L\u00e9vi, trans.

The Mendisians, according to this last writer, paid reverence to all goats, and more to the males than to the females, and particularly to one he-goat, on the death of which public mourning is observed throughout the whole Mendesian district; they call both Pan and the goat Mendes, and both were worshipped as gods of generation and fecundity.

Baphomet features in the Creed of the Gnostic Catholic Church recited by the congregation in ''[[Liber XV, The Gnostic Mass|The Gnostic Mass]]'', in the sentence: \"And I believe in the Serpent and the Lion, Mystery of Mysteries, in His name BAPHOMET.\"<ref>{{Cite web| author = Helena|author2=Tau Apiryon| title = The Invisible Basilica: The Creed of the Gnostic Catholic Church: An Examination| accessdate = 2009-08-09| url = http://www.hermetic.com/sabazius/creed_egc.htm}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Magick (Book 4)]]'', Crowley asserted that Baphomet was a divine androgyne and \"the hieroglyph of arcane perfection\": seen as that which reflects. \"What occurs above so reflects below, or As above so below,\"\n{{quote|The Devil does not exist.

One theory of the name is that it represents the words \u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u1f74 \u03bc\u03ae\u03c4\u03b5\u03bf\u03c2, the baptism of wisdom; another, that it is a corruption of a title meaning \"Father Mithras\". Needless to say, the suffix R supported the latter theory. I added up the word as spelt by the Wizard. It totalled 729. This number had never appeared in my Cabbalistic working and therefore meant nothing to me. It however justified itself as being the cube of nine. The word \u03ba\u03b7\u03c6\u03b1\u03c2, the mystic title given by Christ to Peter as the cornerstone of the Church, has this same value. So far, the Wizard had shown great qualities! He had cleared up the etymological problem and shown why the Templars should have given the name Baphomet to their so-called idol.

Baphomet is followed by [[minotaurs]] and other savage creatures. He desires the end of civilizations so all creatures may embrace their most basic, brutal instincts. He is described as a massive, black minotaur, with blood around his mouth and red eyes. He wears an iron crown topped with the heads of his enemies, along with spiked armor. He wields a huge glaive, named \"Heartcleaver\", but commonly fights with his hooves, claws, and horns. He rules of the 600th layer of [[Abyss (Dungeons & Dragons)|The Abyss]], known as the \"Endless Maze\", and is the sworn enemy of Yeenoghu, another demon lord.\n\nBaphomet also serves as the main antagonist in the PC game ''Tristania 3D'', and is the worshipped deity of the evil Courb\u00e9e Dominate society. The game's storyline describes in depth that in fact Philip IV of France was the one who had worshipped Baphomet, not the Knights Templar, and he deliberately eradicated the entire order to make sure this secret would remain undiscovered. In the last level, the protagonist must enter the afterlife to seek out and defeat Baphomet, however, he is protected by the shadows of his fallen worshippers in the previous levels, along with the ghost of Evil Empress and the protagonist's former accomplice, Evil Twirl. The game depicts Baphomet very close to the original, except that it has a male torso, and dragon-like wings as opposed to feathered ones. Baphomet's main attack is a lethal wall of fire which causes severe damage, and can be manifested in rapid successions. Baphomet also can turn himself invisible during his attack periods. Successfully defeating him shall win the game, albeit it is noted that defeating him does not mean he is killed.\n\nAn interpretation of Baphomet, referred to as The Sword of Baphomet, forms part of the main plot in the 1996 [[Point-and-click adventure|point-and-click adventure game]] developed by [[Revolution Software]], ''[[Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars]].'' It is the first game in the ''[[Broken Sword]]'' series.

Raynouard's]] brilliant defence of the order. The challenge was taken up, among others, by the famous orientalist Friedrich von Hammer-Purgstall, who in 1818 published his ''Mysterium Baphometis revelatum'', an attempt to prove that the Templars followed the doctrines and rites of the Gnostic Ophites, the argument being fortified with reproductions of obscene representations of supposed Gnostic ceremonies and of mystic symbols said to have been found in the Templars' buildings. Wilcke, while rejecting Hammer's main conclusions as unproved, argued in favour of the existence of a secret doctrine based, not on Gnosticism, but on the unitarianism of Islam, of which Baphomet (Mahomet) was the symbol. On the other hand, Wilhelm Havemann (''Geschichte des Ausganges des Tempelherrenordens, Stuttgart and T\u00fcbingen'', 1846) decided in favour of the innocence of the order. This view was also taken by a succession of German scholars, in England by C. G. Addison, and in France by a whole series of conspicuous writers: ''e.g.'' Mignet, Guizot, Renan, Lavocat. Others, like Boutaric, while rejecting the charge of heresy, accepted the evidence for the ''spuitio'' and the indecent kisses, explaining the former as a formula of forgotten meaning and the latter as a sign of ''fraternit\u00e9!''{{-\"}} ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', 1911.</ref>\n\nSince 1856, the name Baphomet has been associated with the \"Sabbatic Goat\" image drawn by [[\u00c9liphas L\u00e9vi]],<ref name=Strube/><ref name=Introvigne/><ref name=Waite/> which contains binary elements representing the \"[[Symbol|symbolization]] of the equilibrium of opposites\"<ref name=Strube/> (e.g. [[Human\u2013animal hybrid|half-human and half-animal]], [[Androgyny|male and female]], [[good and evil]], on and off, etc.).<ref name=Strube/><ref name=Introvigne/> On one hand, L\u00e9vi's intention was to symbolize his concept of balance that was essential to his magnetistic notion of the Astral Light;<ref name=Strube/><ref name=Introvigne/> on the other hand, the Baphomet represents a tradition that should result in a perfect social order.<ref name=Strube/><ref name=Introvigne/>\n\n==History==\nThe name ''Baphomet'' appeared in July 1098 in a letter by the [[Crusades|crusader]] Anselm of Ribemont:\n{|\n|\n{{quote|''Sequenti die aurora apparente, altis vocibus '''Baphometh''' invocaverunt; et nos Deum nostrum in cordibus nostris deprecantes, impetum facientes in eos, de muris civitatis omnes expulimus.''<ref>{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_cIUAAAAQAAJ&pg=PT142 |title=Godefridi Bullonii epistolae et diplomata; accedunt appendices |first=Godfrey |last=Bullonii (of Bouillon) |date=30 March 2018 |via=Google Books}}</ref>}}\n|\n{{quote|As the next day dawned, they called loudly upon '''Baphometh'''; and we prayed silently in our hearts to God, then we attacked and forced all of them outside the city walls.<ref>{{harvnb|Barber|Bate|2010|p=29}}</ref>}}\n|}\n[[Raymond of Aguilers]], a chronicler of the [[First Crusade]], reports that the [[troubadour]]s used the term ''Bafomet'' for the [[Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]] and called the [[mosque]]s ''Bafumarias''.<ref>\"Raimundus de Agiles says of the Mahometans: In ecclesiis autem magnis '''Bafumarias''' faciebant .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. habebant monticulum ubi du\u00e6 erant '''Bafumari\u00e6'''.

Over 100&nbsp;different charges had been leveled against the Templars, including [[Heresy in Christianity|heresy]], [[Homosexuality in medieval Europe|homosexual relations]], spitting and urinating on the cross, and [[sodomy]].<ref name=Stahuljak2/> Most of them were dubious, as they were the same charges that were leveled against the [[Catharism|Cathars]]<ref>{{harvnb|Barber|2006|p=204}}</ref> and many of King Philip's enemies; he had earlier kidnapped [[Pope Boniface VIII]] and charged him with near identical offenses. Yet [[Malcolm Barber]] observes that historians \"find it difficult to accept that an affair of such enormity rests upon total fabrication\".<ref>{{harvnb|Barber|2006|p=306}}</ref> The \"[[Chinon Parchment]] suggests that the Templars did indeed spit on the cross,\" says Sean Martin, and that these acts were intended to simulate the kind of humiliation and torture that a Crusader might be subjected to if captured by the [[Saracen]]s, where they were taught how to commit [[Apostasy in Christianity|apostasy]] \"with the mind only and not with the heart\".<ref>{{harvnb|Martin|2005|p=138}}</ref> Similarly, Michael Haag<ref>{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Haag |title=Templars: History and Myth: From Solomon's temple to the Freemasons |publisher=Profile Books |year=2009}}</ref> suggests that the simulated worship of Baphomet did indeed form part of a Templar initiation ritual.\n\n{{quote| The indictment (acte d'accusation) published by the court of Rome set forth ... \"that in all the provinces they had idols, that is to say, heads, some of which had three faces, others but one; sometimes, it was a human skull ...

The beast's head expresses the horror of the sinner, whose materially acting, solely responsible part has to bear the punishment exclusively; because the soul is insensitive according to its nature and can only suffer when it materializes.

It has been pointed out that these debates included contemporary forms of [[Romanticism|Romantic]] [[socialism]], or [[Utopian socialism]], which were seen as the heirs of the Gnostics, Templars, and other mystics. L\u00e9vi, being himself an adherent of these schools since the 1840s, regarded the socialists and Romantics (such as Lamartine) as the successors of this alleged tradition of true religion. In fact, his narrative mirrors historiographies of socialism, including the ''Histoire des Montagnards'' (1847) by his best friend and political comrade [[Alphonse Esquiros]]. Consequently, the Baphomet is depicted by L\u00e9vi as the symbol of a revolutionary heretical tradition that would soon lead to the \"emancipation of humanity\" and the establishment of a perfect social order.<ref name=Strube/>\n\nIn L\u00e9vi's writings, the Baphomet does not only express a historical-political tradition, but also occult natural forces that are explained by his magical theory of the Astral Light. He developed this notion in the context of what has been called \"spiritualist magnetism\": theories that stressed the religious implications of magnetism. Often, their representatives were socialists that believed in the social consequences of a \"synthesis\" of religion and science that was to be achieved by the means of magnetism.<ref name=Strube/> Spiritualist magnetists with a socialist background include the [[Baron du Potet]] and Henri Delaage, who served as main sources for L\u00e9vi. At the same time, L\u00e9vi polemicized against famed Catholic authors such as Jules-Eudes de Mirville and [[Roger Gougenot des Mousseaux]] who regarded magnetism as the workings of demons and other infernal powers.<ref name=Strube/> The paragraph just before the passage cited in the previous section has to be seen against this background:\n\n{{quote|Let us state now for the edification of the vulgar, for the satisfaction of M. le Comte de Mirville, for the justification of the demonologist Bodin, for the greater glory of the Church, which persecuted Templars, burnt magicians, excommunicated Freemasons, &c. let us state boldly and precisely that all the inferior initiates of the occult sciences and profaners of the great arcanum, not only did in the past, but do now, and will ever, adore what is signified by this alarming symbol.<ref>L\u00e9vi, trans.

One theory of the name is that it represents the words \u03b2\u03b1\u03c6\u1f74 \u03bc\u03ae\u03c4\u03b5\u03bf\u03c2, the baptism of wisdom; another, that it is a corruption of a title meaning \"Father Mithras\". Needless to say, the suffix R supported the latter theory. I added up the word as spelt by the Wizard. It totalled 729. This number had never appeared in my Cabbalistic working and therefore meant nothing to me. It however justified itself as being the cube of nine. The word \u03ba\u03b7\u03c6\u03b1\u03c2, the mystic title given by Christ to Peter as the cornerstone of the Church, has this same value. So far, the Wizard had shown great qualities! He had cleared up the etymological problem and shown why the Templars should have given the name Baphomet to their so-called idol.

Baphomet is followed by [[minotaurs]] and other savage creatures. He desires the end of civilizations so all creatures may embrace their most basic, brutal instincts. He is described as a massive, black minotaur, with blood around his mouth and red eyes. He wears an iron crown topped with the heads of his enemies, along with spiked armor. He wields a huge glaive, named \"Heartcleaver\", but commonly fights with his hooves, claws, and horns. He rules of the 600th layer of [[Abyss (Dungeons & Dragons)|The Abyss]], known as the \"Endless Maze\", and is the sworn enemy of Yeenoghu, another demon lord.\n\nBaphomet also serves as the main antagonist in the PC game ''Tristania 3D'', and is the worshipped deity of the evil Courb\u00e9e Dominate society. The game's storyline describes in depth that in fact Philip IV of France was the one who had worshipped Baphomet, not the Knights Templar, and he deliberately eradicated the entire order to make sure this secret would remain undiscovered. In the last level, the protagonist must enter the afterlife to seek out and defeat Baphomet, however, he is protected by the shadows of his fallen worshippers in the previous levels, along with the ghost of Evil Empress and the protagonist's former accomplice, Evil Twirl. The game depicts Baphomet very close to the original, except that it has a male torso, and dragon-like wings as opposed to feathered ones. Baphomet's main attack is a lethal wall of fire which causes severe damage, and can be manifested in rapid successions. Baphomet also can turn himself invisible during his attack periods. Successfully defeating him shall win the game, albeit it is noted that defeating him does not mean he is killed.\n\nAn interpretation of Baphomet, referred to as The Sword of Baphomet, forms part of the main plot in the 1996 [[Point-and-click adventure|point-and-click adventure game]] developed by [[Revolution Software]], ''[[Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars]].'' It is the first game in the ''[[Broken Sword]]'' series. The player assumes the role of [[George Stobbart (Broken Sword)|George Stobbart]], an American tourist in Paris, as he attempts to unravel a conspiracy much of which is influenced by and includes factual and fictional references and narrative devices relating to the History of the Knights Templar.\n\nIn the popular [[Personal Computer|PC]] video game ''[[Doom II: Hell on Earth]]'', in the final mission \"Icon of Sin\", the titular antagonist has a look similar to that of early depictions of Baphomet.\n\nIn July 2015 YouTube star and singer [[Poppy (singer)|Poppy]] depicted the deity in the music video for her single \"Lowlife\". Poppy can be seen imitating the famous pose of Baphomet.\n\nThe 2018 [[Netflix]] series [[Chilling Adventures of Sabrina (TV series)|''Chilling Adventures of Sabrina'']] has a large statue of Baphomet displayed at the Academy of Unseen Arts. [[The Satanic Temple]] has accused the show of plagiarizing [[Statue of Baphomet|their depiction]] of Baphomet, though later settled out of court.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://friendlyatheist.patheos.com/2018/11/01/the-satanic-temple-netflixs-sabrina-remake-plagiarized-our-baphomet-statue/|title=The Satanic Temple: Netflix's 'Sabrina' Remake Plagiarized Our Baphomet Statue|last=Atheist|first=Friendly|work=Friendly Atheist|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn the video game ''[[Doom Eternal]]'', in the final mission \"Final Sin\", the Icon of Sin has a resemblance to early depictions of Baphomet.\n\n==See also==\n* [[As above, so below]]\n* [[Beelzebub]]\n* [[Behemoth]]\n* [[History of the Knights Templar]]\n* [[Knights Templar legends]]\n* [[The Magician (Tarot card)|The Magician]]\n* [[Mahound]]\n* [[Medieval Christian views on Muhammad]]\n* [[Pazuzu]]\n* [[Termagant]]\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book |last=Barber |given=Malcolm|authorlink=Malcolm Barber |year=1994 |title=The New Knighthood: A History of the Order of the Temple |publisher= Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-42041-9|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Barber |given=Malcolm|year=2006 |title= The Trial of the Templars|publisher= Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-67236-8|edition=2nd|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Barber|first1=Malcolm|last2=Bate|first2=Keith|title= Letters from the East: Crusaders, Pilgrims and Settlers in the 12th-13th Centuries|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|isbn=978-0-7546-6356-0|year=2010|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Budge|first=Ernest Alfred Wallis|title= The Gods of the Egyptians: or, Studies in Egyptian Mythology|year=1904|publisher=Methuen & Co|location=London|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6SBLAAAAYAAJ|volume=II volumes}}\n* {{cite book|last=Crowley|first=Aleister|authorlink=Aleister Crowley|url=http://www.hermetic.com/crowley/eoftg/index.html|year=1974|title=The Equinox of the Gods|location=New York|publisher=Gordon Press}}\n* {{Cite book\n| publisher = Ordo Templi Orientis\n| last = Crowley\n| first = Aleister\n| title = The Book of Thoth; A Short Essay on the Tarot of the Egyptians, being the Equinox, Volume III, No. V\n| location = London\n| year = 1944\n| title-link = The Book of Thoth (Crowley)\n}}\n* {{Cite book\n| publisher = Thelema Media\n| isbn = 978-0-9726583-8-6\n| last = Crowley\n| first = Aleister\n| editor = Louis Wilkinson\n| title = The Law is for All: The Authorized Popular Commentary of Liber Al Vel Legis sub figura CCXX, The Book of the Law\n| date = December 1996\n}}\n* {{Cite book\n| publisher = Samuel Weiser\n| isbn = 978-0-87728-919-7\n| last = Crowley\n| first = Aleister\n| first2 = Mary|last2=Desti\n| author3-link = Leila Waddell\n| first3 = Leila|last3=Waddell\n| editor = [[William Breeze|Hymenaeus.
