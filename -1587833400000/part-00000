{"title_page": "Kiev Missal", "text_new": "The '''Kiev Missal''' (or '''Kiev Fragments''' or '''Kiev Folios'''; scholarly abbreviation '''Ki''') is a seven-folio [[Glagolitic script|Glagolitic]] [[Old Church Slavonic]] [[Old Church Slavonic#Canon|canon]] [[manuscript]] containing parts of the Roman-rite liturgy. It is usually held to be the oldest and the most archaic Old Church Slavonic manuscript,<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Lunt|2001|p=9}} \"The seven glagolitic folia known as the Kiev Folia (KF) are generally considered as most archaic from both the paleographic and the linguistic points of view...\"</ref> and is dated at no later than the latter half of the 10th century.<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Damjanovi\u0107|2003|p=15}}</ref> Seven [[parchment]] folios have been preserved in small format ({{circa}}14.5&nbsp;cm \u00d7 10.5&nbsp;cm) of easily portable book to be of use to [[missionary|missionaries]] on the move.\n[[File:Kiev Folios, fol. 7r.jpg|thumb|Folio 7r.]]\n[[File:Kiev Glagolitic list X.jpg|thumb|right|The third folio of Kiev Missal]]\n\n== Discovery and publishing ==\nKiev Folios were found in the 19th century in Jerusalem by the Archimandrite Andrej Kapustin ([[Antonin Kapustin]]), who donated them the [[Kiev Theological Academy]].<ref name=\"Damjanovic_2003_p16\">{{harvcoltxt|Damjanovi\u0107|2003|p=16}}</ref> After the 1917 Russian Revolution, the folios were transferred to the [[Vernadsky National Library of Ukraine|library of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences]] in [[Kiev]] where they are being kept today.\n\n[[Izmail Sreznevsky]] made the manuscript known to the public, editing the first edition of Kiev Folios in 1874. They have been republished many times since, though not always successfully. Notable editions are by [[Vatroslav Jagi\u0107]] in 1890 (''Glagolitica. 2. W\u00fcrdigung neuentdeckter Fragmente, Mit 10 Taf.'', Wien 1890, Denkschrift. Kaiserl. Akad., Bd. 38), by Sievers in 1924 (''Die altslavischen Verstexte von Kiew und Freising'', Leipzig 1924, Akad. Wiss., phil.-hist. Kl., Bd. 76/2) and by Mohlberg in 1928 (''Il messale di Kiew/sec IX./ed il suo prototipo Romano del VI-VII''). \n\nSpecial attention to the Kiev folios has been paid by [[V\u00e1clav Vondr\u00e1k]] in a paper ''O p\u016fvodu Kijevsk\u00fdch list\u016f a Pra\u017esk\u00fdch zlomk\u016f a o bohemismech v star\u0161\u00edch c\u00edrkevn\u011bslovansk\u00fdch pam\u00e1tk\u00e1ch v\u016fbec'' (Praha, 1904). The newest [[facsimile]] edition has been published in 1983 in Kiev to honor the ninth [[International Congress of Slavists]] which was held there (V. V. Nim\u010duk, ''Kijivs\u2032ki hlaholi\u010dni lystky'', AN USSR). That edition contains extensive overview of the existing bibliography of the Kiev Folios.\n\n== Dating and origin ==\nThe first page of the first folio was written later than other pages, probably at the transition from 11th to 12th century.<ref name=\"Damjanovic_2003_p16\"/> Linguistic, paleographic and graphic features indicate South Croatian area as its place of origin.<ref name=\"Damjanovic_2003_p16\"/> This page contains parts of Paul's epistles (13, 11-14 and 14, 1-4). That part of Kiev Folios and the problems associated with it have been thoroughly analyzed by the Croatian Slavist Marija Panteli\u0107,<ref>{{harvtxt|Panteli\u0107|1985}}</ref> who finally situates them somewhere in the [[Dubrovnik]] area.\n\nThe rest of the folios, containing part of the [[Roman Missal]] is dated at no later than the second half of the 10th century.<ref name=\"Damjanovic_2003_p16\"/>\n\n== Content ==\nBy content it is a [[Roman Missal]], i.e., a book collecting all the text used at the [[Mass (liturgy)|holy mass]] service. Missal texts are accompanied by instructions on how to perform rites throughout the liturgical year, called ''[[rubric]]s'', which is a term originating from [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''rubrica'' designating red soil used for painting. \n\nThe text of the Kiev Missal folios has been for the most part written in black (the text meant to be pronounced), and for the lesser part in red (the instructions for gestures that the priest must perform and other instructions for the ceremony). Since the Kiev Missal has only 13 pages preserved, it's obvious that only a part of the missal has been preserved, from the [[sacramentary]] containing crucial and unchangeable parts spoken by the priest.\n\n== Linguistic features ==\nThe Kiev Folios are generally held by Slavists as the oldest among the OCS canon manuscripts, even though they exhibit several West Slavic features that place them at the beginning of the Czech-Moravian recension of OCS.<ref name=\"Damjanovic_2003_p17\">{{harvcoltxt|Damjanovi\u0107|2003|p=17}}</ref> These are:\n* Instead of OCS ''\u0161t'', ''\u017ed'' we find West Slavic reflexes of [[Proto-Slavic]] */tj/ (also from earlier *kt) and */dj/, i.e. instead of ''pomo\u0161t\u044c'', ''pros\u0119\u0161te'', ''priemlj\u01eb\u0161te'', ''da\u017ed\u044c'', ''tu\u017edim\u044a'', ''t\u044a\u017ede'' we find ''pomoc\u044c'', ''pros\u0119ce'', ''priemlj\u01ebce'', ''daz\u044c'', ''tuzim\u044a'', ''t\u044aze'' etc.<ref name=\"Damjanovic_2003_p17\"/>\n* At the place of Proto-Slavic *stj and *skj we would expect a reflex of OCS ''\u0161t'', but we find ''\u0161\u010d'': ''o\u010di\u0161\u010deni\u011b'', ''za\u0161\u010diti'' (imperative), ''za\u0161\u010ditit\u044c''.\n* As an ending of instrumental singular of masculine o-stems we would expect ''-om\u044c''. But instead, ''-\u044am\u044c'' is used, so instead of expected ''oplatom\u044c'', ''obrazom\u044c'', ''v\u044as\u01ebdom\u044c'' we find ''oplat\u044am\u044c'', ''obraz\u044am\u044c'', ''v\u044as\u01ebd\u044am\u044c''.\n* Genitive of first-person pronoun ''az\u044a'' is ''mene'' in OCS. In Kiev Folios we find ''mne'' by the elision of [[Havl\u00edk's law|weak yer]].\n\nAs features that connect Kiev Folios to the canonic manuscripts of other Slavic areas (namely Bulgaro-Macedonian), one has to note:\n* consistent distinguishing between yers ''\u044a'' and ''\u044c'', and only twice ''\u044a'' is found where ''\u044c'' is expected\n* Kiev folios preserve nasal vowels (/\u0119/ and /\u01eb/) and don't mix them\n\n== Controversies ==\nCroatian Slavist [[Josip Hamm]] stirred a fierce debate in his book ''Das Glagolitische Missale von Kiew'' (Wien, 1979). In it, and in his other papers and lectures he maintained the view that the Kiev Folios are a 19th-century fake by Czech patriots in order to prove the antiquity of Czech literary culture.

It is usually held to be the oldest and the most archaic Old Church Slavonic manuscript,<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Lunt|2001|p=9}} \"The seven glagolitic folia known as the Kiev Folia (KF) are generally considered as most archaic from both the paleographic and the linguistic points of view...\"</ref> and is dated at no later than the latter half of the 10th century.<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Damjanovi\u0107|2003|p=15}}</ref> Seven [[parchment]] folios have been preserved in small format ({{circa}}14.5&nbsp;cm \u00d7 10.5&nbsp;cm) of easily portable book to be of use to [[missionary|missionaries]] on the move.\n[[File:Kiev Folios, fol. 7r.jpg|thumb|Folio 7r.]]\n[[File:Kiev Glagolitic list X.jpg|thumb|right|The third folio of Kiev Missal]]\n\n== Discovery and publishing ==\nKiev Folios were found in the 19th century in Jerusalem by the Archimandrite Andrej Kapustin ([[Antonin Kapustin]]), who donated them the [[Kiev Theological Academy]].<ref name=\"Damjanovic_2003_p16\">{{harvcoltxt|Damjanovi\u0107|2003|p=16}}</ref> After the 1917 Russian Revolution, the folios were transferred to the [[Vernadsky National Library of Ukraine|library of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences]] in [[Kiev]] where they are being kept today.\n\n[[Izmail Sreznevsky]] made the manuscript known to the public, editing the first edition of Kiev Folios in 1874. They have been republished many times since, though not always successfully. Notable editions are by [[Vatroslav Jagi\u0107]] in 1890 (''Glagolitica. 2. W\u00fcrdigung neuentdeckter Fragmente, Mit 10 Taf.'', Wien 1890, Denkschrift. Kaiserl. Akad., Bd. 38), by Sievers in 1924 (''Die altslavischen Verstexte von Kiew und Freising'', Leipzig 1924, Akad. Wiss., phil.-hist. Kl., Bd. 76/2) and by Mohlberg in 1928 (''Il messale di Kiew/sec IX./ed il suo prototipo Romano del VI-VII''). Special attention to the Kiev folios has been paid by [[V\u00e1clav Vondr\u00e1k]] in a paper ''O p\u016fvodu Kijevsk\u00fdch list\u016f a Pra\u017esk\u00fdch zlomk\u016f a o bohemismech v star\u0161\u00edch c\u00edrkevn\u011bslovansk\u00fdch pam\u00e1tk\u00e1ch v\u016fbec'' (Praha, 1904). The newest [[facsimile]] edition has been published in 1983 in Kiev to honor the ninth [[International Congress of Slavists]] which was held there (V. V. Nim\u010duk, ''Kijivs\u2032ki hlaholi\u010dni lystky'', AN USSR). That edition contains extensive overview of the existing bibliography of the Kiev Folios.\n\n== Dating and origin ==\nThe first page of the first folio was written later than other pages, probably at the transition from 11th to 12th century.<ref name=\"Damjanovic_2003_p16\"/> Linguistic, paleographic and graphic features indicate South Croatian area as its place of origin.<ref name=\"Damjanovic_2003_p16\"/> This page contains parts of Paul's epistles (13, 11-14 and 14, 1-4). That part of Kiev Folios and the problems associated with it have been thoroughly analyzed by the Croatian Slavist Marija Panteli\u0107,<ref>{{harvtxt|Panteli\u0107|1985}}</ref> who finally situates them somewhere in the [[Dubrovnik]] area.\n\nThe rest of the folios, containing part of the [[Roman Missal]] is dated at no later than the second half of the 10th century.<ref name=\"Damjanovic_2003_p16\"/>\n\n== Content ==\nBy content it is a [[Roman Missal]], i.e., a book collecting all the text used at the [[Mass (liturgy)|holy mass]] service. Missal texts are accompanied by instructions on how to perform rites throughout the liturgical year, called ''[[rubric]]s'', which is a term originating from [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''rubrica'' designating red soil used for painting. The text of the Kiev Missal folios has been for the most part written in black (the text meant to be pronounced), and for the lesser part in red (the instructions for gestures that the priest must perform and other instructions for the ceremony). Since the Kiev Missal has only 13 pages preserved, it's obvious that only a part of the missal has been preserved, from the [[sacramentary]] containing crucial and unchangeable parts spoken by the priest.\n\n== Linguistic features ==\nThe Kiev Folios are generally held by Slavists as the oldest among the OCS canon manuscripts, even though they exhibit several West Slavic features that place them at the beginning of the Czech-Moravian recension of OCS.<ref name=\"Damjanovic_2003_p17\">{{harvcoltxt|Damjanovi\u0107|2003|p=17}}</ref> These are:\n* Instead of OCS ''\u0161t'', ''\u017ed'' we find West Slavic reflexes of [[Proto-Slavic]] */tj/ (also from earlier *kt) and */dj/, i.e. instead of ''pomo\u0161t\u044c'', ''pros\u0119\u0161te'', ''priemlj\u01eb\u0161te'', ''da\u017ed\u044c'', ''tu\u017edim\u044a'', ''t\u044a\u017ede'' we find ''pomoc\u044c'', ''pros\u0119ce'', ''priemlj\u01ebce'', ''daz\u044c'', ''tuzim\u044a'', ''t\u044aze'' etc.<ref name=\"Damjanovic_2003_p17\"/>\n* At the place of Proto-Slavic *stj and *skj we would expect a reflex of OCS ''\u0161t'', but we find ''\u0161\u010d'': ''o\u010di\u0161\u010deni\u011b'', ''za\u0161\u010diti'' (imperative), ''za\u0161\u010ditit\u044c''.\n* As an ending of instrumental singular of masculine o-stems we would expect ''-om\u044c''. But instead, ''-\u044am\u044c'' is used, so instead of expected ''oplatom\u044c'', ''obrazom\u044c'', ''v\u044as\u01ebdom\u044c'' we find ''oplat\u044am\u044c'', ''obraz\u044am\u044c'', ''v\u044as\u01ebd\u044am\u044c''.\n* Genitive of first-person pronoun ''az\u044a'' is ''mene'' in OCS. In Kiev Folios we find ''mne'' by the elision of [[Havl\u00edk's law|weak yer]].\n\nAs features that connect Kiev Folios to the canonic manuscripts of other Slavic areas (namely Bulgaro-Macedonian), one has to note:\n* consistent distinguishing between yers ''\u044a'' and ''\u044c'', and only twice ''\u044a'' is found where ''\u044c'' is expected\n* Kiev folios preserve nasal vowels (/\u0119/ and /\u01eb/) and don't mix them\n\n== Controversies ==\nCroatian Slavist [[Josip Hamm]] stirred a fierce debate in his book ''Das Glagolitische Missale von Kiew'' (Wien, 1979). In it, and in his other papers and lectures he maintained the view that the Kiev Folios are a 19th-century fake by Czech patriots in order to prove the antiquity of Czech literary culture. However, in general Slavists do not hold this view.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[List of Glagolitic manuscripts]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{citation |last= Damjanovi\u0107 |first= Stjepan |authorlink=Stjepan Damjanovi\u0107 | title= Slovo iskona |publisher= [[Matica hrvatska]] |year= 2004 |location= Zagreb |isbn=953-150-567-5 |language=Croatian}}\n* {{citation |last= Schenker| first= Alexander M. |authorlink=Alexander M.

The final installment of the ''[[Mass Effect]]'' trilogy, it was first released in March 2012 for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Xbox 360]], and [[PlayStation 3]]. A [[Wii U]] version of the game, entitled ''Mass Effect 3: Special Edition'', was later released in November 2012. ''Mass Effect 3'' is set within the [[Milky Way Galaxy]] in 2186, where galactic civilization is invaded by a highly advanced machine race of [[Synthetic intelligence|synthetic]]-[[Carbon-based life|organic]] starships known as Reapers. It concludes the story of [[Commander Shepard]], an elite human soldier who is tasked with forging alliances between species for the war.\n\nSimilar to ''[[Mass Effect 2]]'', the player can import a completed [[saved game]] into ''Mass Effect 3'' that influences the plot by taking previous decisions into account. In general, ''Mass Effect 3'' revolves around increasing military strength by completing [[Quest (video gaming)|missions]] and gathering resources. As BioWare designed the game to be accessible to both old and new players, many of the series' traditional gameplay elements remain, such as [[Cover system|cover]]-based [[Third-person shooter|third-person shooting]], but new aspects are introduced as well, such as a [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] component. The game's [[Video game score|score]] was written by a variety of composers, who aimed for a balance between the [[orchestra]]l sound of ''Mass Effect 2'' and the [[synthesizer]]-driven sound of the original ''[[Mass Effect (video game)|Mass Effect]]''.\n\n''Mass Effect 3'' received critical acclaim for its art direction, characters, emotional story, improved combat, soundtrack, and voice acting. However, its ending was poorly received by fans, who felt that it did not meet expectations. In response to the controversy, BioWare released the ''Extended Cut'' [[downloadable content]] pack, which expands upon the original ending. The game received several year-end awards, including Best RPG at the [[Spike Video Game Awards]] and Game of the Year from ''[[Game Informer]]''. In March 2017, it was followed by a [[sequel]], ''[[Mass Effect: Andromeda]]''.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Mass Effect 3'' is an [[action role-playing game]] in which the player takes control of [[Commander Shepard]] from a [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person perspective]].<ref name=\"Prima Character\">{{cite book|last1=Musa|first1=Alexander|last2=Bueno|first2=Fernando|last3=Lierop|first3=Raphael Van|title=Mass Effect 3: Prima Official Game Guide|date=2012|publisher=[[Prima Games]]|location=Roseville, CA|isbn=978-0-307-89148-8|pages=10\u201313}}</ref> Shepard's gender, appearance, military background, combat training, and first name are determined by the player before the game begins.<ref name=\"Prima Character\" /> If the player has a completed [[saved game]] from ''[[Mass Effect 2]]'', the character from that game can be imported.<ref name=\"Import\">{{cite web|last1=Moriarty|first1=Colin|title=Mass Effect 3 Review: Page 2 of 3|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/03/06/mass-effect-3-review?page=2|website=[[IGN]]|date=March 6, 2012|accessdate=December 28, 2017}}</ref> By importing an old character, decisions from prior ''Mass Effect'' titles are carried over, which impacts the plot of ''Mass Effect 3''.<ref name=\"Import\" /> Similar to previous installments in the series, the player is able to choose from six different [[character class]]es that each have their own unique set of skills.<ref name=\"Tips\">{{cite web|last1=Cox|first1=Kate|title=Before You Start\u2026 Tips for Playing Mass Effect 3 The Best Way|url=https://kotaku.com/5890848/before-you-start-tips-for-playing-mass-effect-3-the-best-way|website=[[Kotaku]]|date=March 6, 2012|accessdate=December 28, 2017|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/71HQfbTNo?url=https://kotaku.com/5890848/before-you-start-tips-for-playing-mass-effect-3-the-best-way|archivedate=July 29, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> For example, the Infiltrator class is proficient in stealth and sniping abilities whereas biotics-inclined classes possess [[Psychokinesis|psychokinetic powers]].<ref name=\"Tips\"/> By completing assignments and [[Quest (video gaming)|quests]], the player is rewarded with [[experience point]]s.<ref name=\"Prima Character\" /> Once enough points are earned, Shepard levels up, which allows for the unlocking or upgrading of skills along a [[Glossary of video game terms#Skilltree|tree]].<ref name=GSCC>{{cite web|url=http://comic-con.gamespot.com/story/6324863/comic-con-2011-mass-effect-3-hands-on-preview-biotics-and-branching-upgrades |title=Comic-Con 2011: Mass Effect 3 Hands-On Preview - Biotics and Branching Upgrades |date=July 22, 2011 |accessdate=July 24, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726053512/http://comic-con.gamespot.com/story/6324863/comic-con-2011-mass-effect-3-hands-on-preview-biotics-and-branching-upgrades |archivedate=July 26, 2011 |url-status=dead |website=[[GameSpot]]|last1=McInnis|first1=Shaun}}</ref>\n\n''Mass Effect 3'' has three pre-set [[Campaign (role-playing games)|campaign]] modes: Action, Story, and RPG.<ref name=\"Three Modes\">{{cite magazine |last1=Francis |first1=Tom |title=Mass Effect 3 Narrative Mode and Action Mode explained |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/mass-effect-3-narrative-mode-and-action-mode-explained/ |magazine=[[PC Gamer]] |accessdate=June 3, 2018 |date=March 7, 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/71HSz91FS?url=https://www.pcgamer.com/mass-effect-3-narrative-mode-and-action-mode-explained/|archivedate=July 29, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> In Action Mode, conversations have automatic replies and normal combat difficulty; in Story Mode, conversations have manual replies and minimal combat difficulty; and in RPG Mode, conversations have manual replies and normal combat difficulty.<ref name=\"Three Modes\" /> The game contains various [[Role-playing game|role-playing]] elements,<ref name=Best>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/111814-BioWare-Mass-Effect-3-Is-the-Best-Game-Weve-Ever-Made|title=BioWare: Mass Effect 3 Is the Best Game We've Ever Made|date=July 22, 2011|accessdate=July 24, 2011|last=Westbrook|first=Logan|magazine=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/71HT6O6rv?url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/111814-BioWare-Mass-Effect-3-Is-the-Best-Game-Weve-Ever-Made|archivedate=July 29, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> such as the ability to augment guns with different ammo types, barrels, modifications, and scopes to improve their effectiveness in combat.

\"generally favorable reviews\" from [[Video game journalism|video game publications]], according to [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]]. The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of the game finished with scores of 93 out of 100, making ''Mass Effect 3'' the [[2012 in video gaming|highest-rated game of 2012]] on both systems.<ref name=\"MCXbox\" /><ref name=\"MCPS3\" /><ref name=\"MCPC\" /><ref name=\"MCWii\" />\n\nCritics felt that ''Mass Effect 3'' was a satisfying conclusion to the ''Mass Effect'' trilogy. In a perfect review for ''[[Eurogamer]]'', Dan Whitehead praised the game for providing a definitive close to the saga instead of something more ambiguous or open-ended.<ref name=\"eurog-review\" /> Writing for ''[[Game Informer]]'', Andrew Reiner proclaimed that BioWare had created one of the most \"intricately crafted\" stories in the history of video gaming.<ref name=\"gi-review\" /> Tom Francis of [[PC Gamer#PC Gamer US|''PC Gamer'' (US)]] remarked that the finale was a \"mixed bag\", but ultimately praised its scale and emotional impact, which he felt was more satisfying than its main plot.<ref name=\"pcgus-review\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/review/mass-effect-3-review/|title=Mass Effect 3 review|last=Francis|first=Tom|date=March 6, 2012|magazine=[[PC Gamer]]|accessdate=March 6, 2012|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20121208143402/http://www.pcgamer.com/review/mass-effect-3-review/|archivedate=December 8, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nReviewers highlighted the experience of playing ''Mass Effect 3'' with an imported saved game.

Discussing combat for [[IGN]], Colin Moriarty observed that while changes from prior installments were minor, they were still evident, and anticipated that multiplayer would give the game added replay value.<ref name=\"ign-review\" /> While ''Game Informer'' noted that combat was not perfect, they were still positive and concluded that enemy encounters were more intense and interesting than in ''Mass Effect 2'', due in part to a greater variety in environment and enemy types.<ref name=\"gi-review\" /> In an otherwise enthusiastic write-up for [[GameSpot]], Kevin VanOrd recounted numerous glitches during combat, such as party members putting themselves in the line of fire by climbing onto crates and enemies getting stuck on walls.<ref name=\"gspot-review\" /> [[Machinima, Inc.|Machinima]] also noted numerous bugs, but relented that ''Mass Effect 3'' was still a memorable experience, citing the game's strong characters as compensation for its flaws.<ref name=\"MCXbox\" />\n\nOther aspects of ''Mass Effect 3'' to receive praise included its art design, music, and [[voice acting]].

Critics felt the ending rendered character choices inconsequential; a general lack of closure; lore contradictions and plot holes; character and narrative inconsistencies; the absence of a final boss

attention for its lasting impact on the reputation of ''Mass Effect 3''. For example, a 2017 article by James Davenport of ''PC Gamer'' opined that the game's ending received an \"inordinate\" amount of criticism, and while he agreed that the ending was \"problematic\", he also noted that fixating on the ending could distract players from other aspects of the game.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Davenport |first1=James |title=The Mass Effect games ranked from worst to best |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/the-mass-effect-games-ranked-from-worst-to-best/ |website=[[PC Gamer]] |accessdate=December 26, 2019 |date=April 27, 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20200104202828/https://www.pcgamer.com/the-mass-effect-games-ranked-from-worst-to-best/ |archivedate=January 4, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2018, Lucy O'Brien of IGN posited that BioWare's cooperative response to \"Retake Mass Effect\" contributed to a paradigm shift in how consumers influence video game developers.

The final installment of the ''[[Mass Effect]]'' trilogy, it was first released in March 2012 for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Xbox 360]], and [[PlayStation 3]]. A [[Wii U]] version of the game, entitled ''Mass Effect 3: Special Edition'', was later released in November 2012. ''Mass Effect 3'' is set within the [[Milky Way Galaxy]] in 2186, where galactic civilization is invaded by a highly advanced machine race of [[Synthetic intelligence|synthetic]]-[[Carbon-based life|organic]] starships known as Reapers. It concludes the story of [[Commander Shepard]], an elite human soldier who is tasked with forging alliances between species for the war.\n\nSimilar to ''[[Mass Effect 2]]'', the player can import a completed [[saved game]] into ''Mass Effect 3'' that influences the plot by taking previous decisions into account. In general, ''Mass Effect 3'' revolves around increasing military strength by completing [[Quest (video gaming)|missions]] and gathering resources. As BioWare designed the game to be accessible to both old and new players, many of the series' traditional gameplay elements remain, such as [[Cover system|cover]]-based [[Third-person shooter|third-person shooting]], but new aspects are introduced as well, such as a [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] component. The game's [[Video game score|score]] was written by a variety of composers, who aimed for a balance between the [[orchestra]]l sound of ''Mass Effect 2'' and the [[synthesizer]]-driven sound of the original ''[[Mass Effect (video game)|Mass Effect]]''.\n\n''Mass Effect 3'' received critical acclaim for its art direction, characters, emotional story, improved combat, soundtrack, and voice acting. However, its ending was poorly received by fans, who felt that it did not meet expectations.

Livingstone, who served as voiceover director, coordinated recording sessions from Edmonton while the actors worked remotely.<ref name=\"Recording\" /> BioWare noted that this approach, combined with the sheer volume of dialog, made it difficult to consistently capture the proper [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] and [[Loudness|volume]] of each line.<ref name=\"DialogPCG\" /> To help reduce these kinds of errors, they developed their own technology, such as the \"Intensity Volume Matrix\", which listed out each line and the appropriate tone associated with it.<ref name=\"Recording\"

a new, Prothean squad mate from the base game.<ref name=\"FinalH\" /> In November, a private [[Software testing|beta]] of ''Mass Effect 3'' was leaked onto [[Xbox Live]], which allowed players to

\"generally favorable reviews\" from [[Video game journalism|video game publications]], according to [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]]. The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of the game finished with scores of 93 out of 100, making ''Mass Effect 3'' the [[2012 in video gaming|highest-rated game of 2012]] on both systems.<ref name=\"MCXbox\" /><ref name=\"MCPS3\" /><ref name=\"MCPC\" /><ref name=\"MCWii\" />\n\nCritics felt that ''Mass Effect 3'' was a satisfying conclusion to the ''Mass Effect'' trilogy. In a perfect review for ''[[Eurogamer]]'', Dan Whitehead praised the game for providing a definitive close to the saga instead of something more ambiguous or open-ended.<ref name=\"eurog-review\" /> Writing for ''[[Game Informer]]'', Andrew Reiner proclaimed that BioWare had created one of the most \"intricately crafted\" stories in the history of video gaming.<ref name=\"gi-review\" /> Tom Francis of [[PC Gamer#PC Gamer US|''PC Gamer'' (US)]] remarked that the finale was a \"mixed bag\", but ultimately praised its scale and emotional impact, which he felt was more satisfying than its main plot.<ref name=\"pcgus-review\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/review/mass-effect-3-review/|title=Mass Effect 3 review|last=Francis|first=Tom|date=March 6, 2012|magazine=[[PC Gamer]]|accessdate=March 6, 2012|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20121208143402/http://www.pcgamer.com/review/mass-effect-3-review/|archivedate=December 8, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nReviewers highlighted the experience of playing ''Mass Effect 3'' with an imported saved game. In a piece for ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'', Arthur Gies opined that, while the game would be engaging without any previous context, it would be more meaningful for players who also played through ''Mass Effect'' and ''Mass Effect 2''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gies |first1=Arthur |title=Mass Effect 3 Review: The Sharp Edge of Hope |url=https://www.polygon.com/2012/10/2/3443570/mass-effect-3-review-the-sharp-edge-of-hope |website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |accessdate=July 28, 2018 |date=March 6, 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20150201115511/http://www.polygon.com/2012/10/2/3443570/mass-effect-3-review-the-sharp-edge-of-hope |archivedate=February 1, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> Gus Mastrapa of [[The A.V.

Discussing combat for [[IGN]], Colin Moriarty observed that while changes from prior installments were minor, they were still evident, and anticipated that multiplayer would give the game added replay value.<ref name=\"ign-review\" /> While ''Game Informer'' noted that combat was not perfect, they were still positive and concluded that enemy encounters were more intense and interesting than in ''Mass Effect 2'', due in part to a greater variety in environment and enemy types.<ref name=\"gi-review\" /> In an otherwise enthusiastic write-up for [[GameSpot]], Kevin VanOrd recounted numerous glitches during combat, such as party members putting themselves in the line of fire by climbing onto crates and enemies getting stuck on walls.<ref name=\"gspot-review\" /> [[Machinima, Inc.|Machinima]] also noted numerous bugs, but relented that ''Mass Effect 3'' was still a memorable experience, citing the game's strong characters as compensation for its flaws.<ref name=\"MCXbox\" />\n\nOther aspects of ''Mass Effect 3'' to receive praise included its art design, music, and [[voice acting]]. GameSpot described the art design as \"fantastic\" and gave particular attention to its use of color and composition.<ref name=\"gspot-review\" /> In that same review, the website complimented the game's voice acting for bringing its major characters to life.<ref name=\"gspot-review\" /> ''PC Gamer'' (US) made special mention of the game's music, calling it \"gorgeous\" and observing that it significantly added to the emotional impact of the game.<ref name=\"pcgus-review\" /> ''[[The Verge]]'' went a step further and described the score as one of the most \"powerful and memorable\" ever created for a video game.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sam Hulick - Biography |url=https://samhulick.com/#bio |publisher=Sam Hulick Official Website |accessdate=July 28, 2018 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20200101160444/https://samhulick.com/%23bio#bio |archivedate=January 1, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> Kirk Hamilton of ''[[Kotaku]]'' felt that the score represented some of the best video game music of 2012.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=May 21, 2013 |title=The Best Video Game Music of 2012 |first=Kirk |last=Hamilton |date=December 13, 2012 |website=[[Kotaku]] |url=http://kotaku.com/5968289/the-best-video-game-music-of-2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130521094426/http://kotaku.com/5968289/the-best-video-game-music-of-2012 |archivedate=May 21, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Controversy===\n{{quote box\n | align = right\n | width = 30%\n | quote = \"I remember about a week or so after we had launched [the game], we'd seen all these excellent critical reviews ... then all of a sudden people were saying, 'I felt the ending was weak.'

Now known as \"One\", he recruits five other people to abandon their pasts and join his cause as \"ghosts\": Two, a spy; Three, a hitman; Four, a [[parkour]] runner and thief; Five, a doctor; and Six, a driver.\n\nOn their first mission in [[Florence]], [[Italy]], the team kills the lawyer of Turgistan's four generals before they are chased across the city by the Mafia and the police. Six is killed just as they manage to get away. Days later, One recruits Blaine, a former [[Delta Force]] [[sniper]] suffering from [[Survivor guilt|survivor's guilt]] over his inability to save his team due to orders in Afghanistan, and renames him \"Seven\". One plans a mission to stage a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] to topple the [[government]] of Turgistan dictator Rovach Alimov and install his imprisoned brother Murat as the country's new leader during the [[Day of the Dead]]. It is revealed that Two had reluctantly captured Murat and handed him back to Rovach before becoming a Ghost.\n\nThe team assassinates Rovach's generals in [[Las Vegas]] and successfully extracts Murat from [[Hong Kong]], but Four is nearly killed until Seven intervenes despite protests from One. Following an argument between One and Seven about One's willingness to leave people behind, the Ghosts break their code of anonymity and reveal each other's names. In [[Turgistan]], One sets his plan in motion by [[Security hacker|hacking]] the state-run television station during Rovach's address to give Murat a voice to the people. Murat's impromptu speech inspires the citizens to revolt while strategic explosions in the city force Rovach to evacuate to his private yacht and Murat occupies the palace. The Ghosts storm through the yacht and One activates a magnetic pulse to incapacitate the guards. When the yacht is immobilized in the middle of the ocean, One decides to save Four from a henchman instead of capturing Rovach. Rovach flees by helicopter, only to discover it to be commandeered by Murat and the Ghosts, who drop him near the border to feed him to the refugees that fled his regime.\n\nIn the aftermath of the revolution, Murat becomes Turgistan's new president and the ghosts part ways until they are once again needed. Two and Three begin a relationship, as well as Four and Five, and One travels to [[New York City]] and sees his son, whom he will pass his fortunes to should he die in the next mission.\nEnd Credit scene shows Crossover with Deadpool\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Ryan Reynolds]] as Gray / One and Himself<ref>https://screenrant.com/ryan-reynolds-6-underground-opening-car-crash-stunt/</ref>\n* [[M\u00e9lanie Laurent]] as Camille / Two \n* [[Corey Hawkins]] as Blaine / Seven\n* [[Manuel Garcia-Rulfo]] as Javier / Three \n* [[Ben Hardy (actor)|Ben Hardy]] as Billy / Four \n* [[Adria Arjona]] as Amelia / Five\n* [[Dave Franco]] as David / Six\n* [[Lior Raz]] as Rovach Alimov \n* [[Payman Maadi|Peyman Maadi]] as Murat Alimov \n* [[Yuri Kolokolnikov]] as Baasha Zia\n* [[Tauras \u010ci\u017eas]] as Horseman\n* [[Algirdas Dainavi\u010dius]] as Rooftop General\n* [[Kim Kold]] as Daqeeq\n* [[James Murray (English actor)|James Murray]] as Caleb\n* [[Ron Funches]] as Blaine's Cousin / The Funeral Speaker\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Archway along riverside in Florence while filming &#039;Six Underground&#039;, September 2018.png|thumb|left|Filming in Florence in September 2018]]\nOn March 7, 2018, it was reported that [[Michael Bay]] would direct the action thriller film, ''6&nbsp;Underground'', based on the script by [[Paul Wernick]] and [[Rhett Reese]], which would be produced by [[Skydance Media]]'s [[David Ellison]], Dana Goldberg, and [[Don Granger]] along with Bay.<ref name=\"Mar2018V\">{{cite news|last1=Kroll|first1=Justin|title=Michael Bay Sets '6 Underground,' 'Robopocalypse' as Next Two Films (EXCLUSIVE)|url=https://variety.com/2018/film/news/michael-bay-new-movies-six-underground-robopocalypse-1202721030/|accessdate=March 9, 2018|work=Variety|date=March 7, 2018}}</ref> In May 2018, it was reported that [[Netflix]] would distribute the film, for what they intend to be a new action franchise with [[Ryan Reynolds]] starring in the lead role.<ref name=\"Deadline(2018-05-22)\" />\n\nIn July 2018, [[Dave Franco]], [[Manuel Garcia-Rulfo]], [[Adria Arjona]], [[Corey Hawkins]], [[Ben Hardy (actor)|Ben Hardy]] and [[Lior Raz]] joined the cast.<ref name=\"Jul2018V\">{{cite news |last1=Kroll |first1=Justin |title=Michael Bay's '6 Underground' Sets Ensemble to Join Ryan Reynolds (Exclusive) |url=https://variety.com/2018/film/news/dave-franco-ryna-reynolds-michael-bay-six-underground-netflix-1202877968/ |accessdate=July 21, 2018 |work=Variety |date=July 19, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/fauda-star-lior-raz-star-ryan-reynolds-michael-bays-six-underground-1130718|title='Fauda' Star Lior Raz to Co-Star With Ryan Reynolds in Michael Bay's 'Six Underground' (Exclusive)|work=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref><ref name=\"HardyCast\">{{cite news |last1=Fleming Jr. |first1=Mike |title='Bohemian Rhapsody's Ben Hardy Joins Michael Bay's '6 Underground' At Netflix |url=https://deadline.com/2018/07/michael-bay-ben-hardy-6-underground-bohemian-rhapsody-ryan-reynolds-netflix-1202436880/ |accessdate=August 3, 2018 |work=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=July 30, 2018}}</ref> In August 2018, [[M\u00e9lanie Laurent]] and [[Payman Maadi|Peyman Maadi]] joined the cast of the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2018/08/melanie-laurent-payman-maadi-join-ryan-reynolds-michael-bay-netflix-movie-6-underground-1202445797/|title=M\u00e9lanie Laurent & Payman Maadi Join Michael Bay's Big-Budget Netflix Pic '6 Underground'|website=Deadline Hollywood|first=Andreas|last=Wiseman|date=August 15, 2018|accessdate=August 15, 2018}}</ref> Principal production commenced on July 30, 2018.\n\nOver the subsequent months, shooting would be completed in several cities of [[Italy]], in [[Los Angeles]], [[Budapest]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thegww.com/michael-bay-ryan-reynolds-six-underground-starts-filming-august-2nd-in-la-and-rome/|title=Michael Bay/Ryan Reynolds' 'Six Underground' Starts Filming August 2nd In LA and Rome|website=thegww.com|date=July 12, 2018}}</ref> and in the [[United Arab Emirates]]: in [[Al Ain]], [[Liwa Oasis]], [[Ras Al Khaimah]], [[Sharjah]], [[Al Jazirah Al Hamra]] (standing in for Nigeria and Afghanistan)<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4gf7_AqUms |title=Exclusive behind the scenes with Ryan Reynolds and Michael Bay of \u20186 Underground\u2019 in Abu Dhabi |date=December 18, 2019 |publisher=Youtube|access-date=December 29, 2019 |quote= Ryan Reynolds, director Michael Bay and the film crew discussing the complex 27-day shoot in the Emirate}}</ref> and, particularly in the [[Emirate of Abu Dhabi]].

Now known as \"One\", he recruits five other people to abandon their pasts and join his cause as \"ghosts\": Two, a spy; Three, a hitman; Four, a [[parkour]] runner and thief; Five, a doctor; and Six, a driver.\n\nOn their first mission in [[Florence]], [[Italy]], the team kills the lawyer of Turgistan's four generals before they are chased across the city by the Mafia and the police. Six is killed just as they manage to get away. Days later, One recruits Blaine, a former [[Delta Force]] [[sniper]] suffering from [[Survivor guilt|survivor's guilt]] over his inability to save his team due to orders in Afghanistan, and renames him \"Seven\". One plans a mission to stage a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] to topple the [[government]] of Turgistan dictator Rovach Alimov and install his imprisoned brother Murat as the country's new leader during the [[Day of the Dead]]. It is revealed that Two had reluctantly captured Murat and handed him back to Rovach before becoming a Ghost.\n\nThe team assassinates Rovach's generals in [[Las Vegas]] and successfully extracts Murat from [[Hong Kong]], but Four is nearly killed until Seven intervenes despite protests from One. Following an argument between One and Seven about One's willingness to leave people behind, the Ghosts break their code of anonymity and reveal each other's names. In [[Turgistan]], One sets his plan in motion by [[Security hacker|hacking]] the state-run television station during Rovach's address to give Murat a voice to the people. Murat's impromptu speech inspires the citizens to revolt while strategic explosions in the city force Rovach to evacuate to his private yacht and Murat occupies the palace. The Ghosts storm through the yacht and One activates a magnetic pulse to incapacitate the guards. When the yacht is immobilized in the middle of the ocean, One decides to save Four from a henchman instead of capturing Rovach. Rovach flees by helicopter, only to discover it to be commandeered by Murat and the Ghosts, who drop him near the border to feed him to the refugees that fled his regime.\n\nIn the aftermath of the revolution, Murat becomes Turgistan's new president and the ghosts part ways until they are once again needed. Two and Three begin a relationship, as well as Four and Five, and One travels to [[New York City]] and sees his son, whom he will pass his fortunes to should he die in the next mission.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Ryan Reynolds]] as Gray / One and Himself<ref>https://screenrant.com/ryan-reynolds-6-underground-opening-car-crash-stunt/</ref>\n* [[M\u00e9lanie Laurent]] as Camille / Two \n* [[Corey Hawkins]] as Blaine / Seven\n* [[Manuel Garcia-Rulfo]] as Javier / Three \n* [[Ben Hardy (actor)|Ben Hardy]] as Billy / Four \n* [[Adria Arjona]] as Amelia / Five\n* [[Dave Franco]] as David / Six\n* [[Lior Raz]] as Rovach Alimov \n* [[Payman Maadi|Peyman Maadi]] as Murat Alimov \n* [[Yuri Kolokolnikov]] as Baasha Zia\n* [[Tauras \u010ci\u017eas]] as Horseman\n* [[Algirdas Dainavi\u010dius]] as Rooftop General\n* [[Kim Kold]] as Daqeeq\n* [[James Murray (English actor)|James Murray]] as Caleb\n* [[Ron Funches]] as Blaine's Cousin / The Funeral Speaker\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Archway along riverside in Florence while filming &#039;Six Underground&#039;, September 2018.png|thumb|left|Filming in Florence in September 2018]]\nOn March 7, 2018, it was reported that [[Michael Bay]] would direct the action thriller film, ''6&nbsp;Underground'', based on the script by [[Paul Wernick]] and [[Rhett Reese]], which would be produced by [[Skydance Media]]'s [[David Ellison]], Dana Goldberg, and [[Don Granger]] along with Bay.<ref name=\"Mar2018V\">{{cite news|last1=Kroll|first1=Justin|title=Michael Bay Sets '6 Underground,' 'Robopocalypse' as Next Two Films (EXCLUSIVE)|url=https://variety.com/2018/film/news/michael-bay-new-movies-six-underground-robopocalypse-1202721030/|accessdate=March 9, 2018|work=Variety|date=March 7, 2018}}</ref> In May 2018, it was reported that [[Netflix]] would distribute the film, for what they intend to be a new action franchise with [[Ryan Reynolds]] starring in the lead role.<ref name=\"Deadline(2018-05-22)\" />\n\nIn July 2018, [[Dave Franco]], [[Manuel Garcia-Rulfo]], [[Adria Arjona]], [[Corey Hawkins]], [[Ben Hardy (actor)|Ben Hardy]] and [[Lior Raz]] joined the cast.<ref name=\"Jul2018V\">{{cite news |last1=Kroll |first1=Justin |title=Michael Bay's '6 Underground' Sets Ensemble to Join Ryan Reynolds (Exclusive) |url=https://variety.com/2018/film/news/dave-franco-ryna-reynolds-michael-bay-six-underground-netflix-1202877968/ |accessdate=July 21, 2018 |work=Variety |date=July 19, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/fauda-star-lior-raz-star-ryan-reynolds-michael-bays-six-underground-1130718|title='Fauda' Star Lior Raz to Co-Star With Ryan Reynolds in Michael Bay's 'Six Underground' (Exclusive)|work=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref><ref name=\"HardyCast\">{{cite news |last1=Fleming Jr. |first1=Mike |title='Bohemian Rhapsody's Ben Hardy Joins Michael Bay's '6 Underground' At Netflix |url=https://deadline.com/2018/07/michael-bay-ben-hardy-6-underground-bohemian-rhapsody-ryan-reynolds-netflix-1202436880/ |accessdate=August 3, 2018 |work=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=July 30, 2018}}</ref> In August 2018, [[M\u00e9lanie Laurent]] and [[Payman Maadi|Peyman Maadi]] joined the cast of the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2018/08/melanie-laurent-payman-maadi-join-ryan-reynolds-michael-bay-netflix-movie-6-underground-1202445797/|title=M\u00e9lanie Laurent & Payman Maadi Join Michael Bay's Big-Budget Netflix Pic '6 Underground'|website=Deadline Hollywood|first=Andreas|last=Wiseman|date=August 15, 2018|accessdate=August 15, 2018}}</ref> Principal production commenced on July 30, 2018.\n\nOver the subsequent months, shooting would be completed in several cities of [[Italy]], in [[Los Angeles]], [[Budapest]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thegww.com/michael-bay-ryan-reynolds-six-underground-starts-filming-august-2nd-in-la-and-rome/|title=Michael Bay/Ryan Reynolds' 'Six Underground' Starts Filming August 2nd In LA and Rome|website=thegww.com|date=July 12, 2018}}</ref> and in the [[United Arab Emirates]]: in [[Al Ain]], [[Liwa Oasis]], [[Ras Al Khaimah]], [[Sharjah]], [[Al Jazirah Al Hamra]] (standing in for Nigeria and Afghanistan)<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4gf7_AqUms |title=Exclusive behind the scenes with Ryan Reynolds and Michael Bay of \u20186 Underground\u2019 in Abu Dhabi |date=December 18, 2019 |publisher=Youtube|access-date=December 29, 2019 |quote= Ryan Reynolds, director Michael Bay and the film crew discussing the complex 27-day shoot in the Emirate}}</ref> and, particularly in the [[Emirate of Abu Dhabi]].

''[[Screen Daily]]'', 10 September 2019.</ref> It was released on the streaming service on 20 March 2020.\n\n==Plot==\nGoreng awakes in a concrete cell marked with the number 48. His roommate, Trimagasi, explains that they are in a tower-style facility in which food is delivered via a platform that travels from the top, stopping for a fixed period on each floor. Those on lower levels are able to eat only what those at the top leave them, and they cannot hoard food (the cell is heated or cooled to fatal levels if food is kept). Every month, people are randomly reassigned to a new level. Each resident is allowed to bring one item in with them, Goreng choosing a copy of ''[[Don Quixote]]'', and Trimagasi a self-sharpening knife called the Samurai Plus. \n\nOne day, a bloodied woman named Miharu rides down on the platform, and Trimagasi explains that she descends the pit every month in search of her child. Goreng sees her being attacked by the two people on the level below, and he considers jumping down to help her, but she kills them both and rides the platform down again.\n\nAs they talk, it is revealed that Goreng volunteered to spend six months in the \"Vertical Self-Management Center\" in exchange for a diploma, and Trimagasi is serving a year-long sentence for manslaughter. Over the month, they become friendly, but on the day of the room shuffle, Goreng wakes up tied to the bed. They have been reassigned to level 171, where the platform is expected to be empty of food when it arrives. Trimagasi explains that he plans to cut strips of Goreng's flesh to sustain them both, but only in moderate amounts so he doesn't bleed out. On the eighth day, Trimagasi cuts into Goreng's leg but is attacked by Miharu as she comes down the platform. She frees Goreng and he kills Trimagasi. Miharu cuts some of Trimagasi's flesh, feeding Goreng and eating some herself before continuing down.\n\nThe following month, Goreng awakes on level 33 with a woman, Imoguiri, as a cellmate. The only thing she brought with her was her dog. Goreng recognizes her as the Administration official who interviewed him before sending him to the cells. She tells Goreng that she believes there are 200 floors. She says she was unaware of the horrible conditions and volunteered to try to fix things when she was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Imoguiri rations her food and attempts to convince those below to do so as well, but they ignore her until Goreng threatens to defecate in their food.\n\nGoreng encounters Miharu once again as she rides down on the platform but she appears critically injured, presumably from being in a fight on the higher levels. Goreng and Imoguiri grab her off the platform and tend to her wounds. Goreng explains to Imoguiri about Miharu's search for her child, but Imoguiri says nobody under the age of 16 is allowed into the facility and says Miharu entered alone. Goreng awakens to see Miharu and Imoguiri in a standoff, as Miharu has eaten Imoguiri's dog. Goreng awakens the following month on level 202 and finds that Imoguiri has hanged herself. Goreng eats her flesh to survive, experiencing hallucinations of her and Trimagasi instructing him to do so.\n\nHe then awakens the following month on level 6. His roommate, Baharat, attempts to climb up through the upper level with the help of those above using a rope he brought into the pit. The couple living on the level above first help him, but end up defecating in his face, and pushing him back down. Estimating that there are around 250 levels, Goreng makes a plan to ride the platform down, rationing the food so all get a share, and convinces Baharat to go with him. As they descend, they hand out portions to the prisoners, attacking those who refuse to cooperate. Going down, they encounter Miharu fighting two other residents and try to help her, but she is killed, they are severely injured themselves. Goreng and Baharat continue to descend, eventually passing level 250 and reaching level 333 where the platform stops. Goreng notices a child hiding under the bed, and assumes it is Miharu's son. He gets off the platform, followed hesitantly by Baharat, only to have the platform continue downward, leaving them behind. They then discover the child is actually a girl, who turns out to be Miharu's  daughter. Despite Baharat's reluctance, they feed her an untouched [[panna cotta]] they had been saving as a \"message\" for the Administrators at the top. \n\nGoreng passes out and dreams of Baharat telling him that \"the girl is the message.\" The next day, Goreng finds Baharat dead after succumbing to his injuries, and takes the child with him when the platform arrives; they descend to the bottom of the pit where he once again sees Trimagasi, who tells him that \"the message requires no bearer.\" Goreng gets off the platform and walks away with Trimagasi, both turning to watch as the girl is transported upwards.\n\n== Cast==\n[[File:El hoyo prentsaurrekoa rueda de prensa.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cast and crew members at a press conference in October 2019.]]\n* [[Iv\u00e1n Massagu\u00e9]] as ''Goreng'', named after ''[[:wiktionary:goreng|gor\u00e8ng]]'', which means \"fried\" in Malay/Indonesian.\n* Zorion Eguileor ([[:eu:Zorion_Egileor|eu]]) as ''Trimagasi'', named after terima kasih, which stands for \"thank you\" in Malay/Indonesian language\n* [[Antonia San Juan]] as ''Imoguiri'', named after ''[[Imogiri]]'', a royal graveyard in Indonesia. \n* [[Emilio Buale Coka]] as ''Baharat'', named after ''[[baharat]]'', a spice blend used in Turkish and Greek cuisine.\n* Alexandra Masangkay as ''Miharu'' \n* Eric L.

''[[Screen Daily]]'', 10 September 2019.</ref> It was released on the streaming service on 20 March 2020.\n\n==Plot==\nGoreng awakes in a concrete cell marked with the number 48. His roommate, Trimagasi, explains that they are in a tower-style facility in which food is delivered via a platform that travels from the top, stopping for a fixed period on each floor. Those on lower levels are able to eat only what those at the top leave them, and they cannot hoard food (the cell is heated or cooled to fatal levels if food is kept). Every month, people are randomly reassigned to a new level. Each resident is allowed to bring one item in with them, Goreng choosing a copy of ''[[Don Quixote]]'', and Trimagasi a self-sharpening knife called the Samurai Plus. \n\nOne day, a bloodied woman named Miharu rides down on the platform, and Trimagasi explains that she descends the pit every month in search of her child. Goreng sees her being attacked by the two people on the level below, and he considers jumping down to help her, but she kills them both and rides the platform down again.\n\nAs they talk, it is revealed that Goreng volunteered to spend six months in the \"Vertical Self-Management Center\" in exchange for a diploma, and Trimagasi is serving a year-long sentence for manslaughter. Over the month, they become friendly, but on the day of the room shuffle, Goreng wakes up tied to the bed. They have been reassigned to level 171, where the platform is expected to be empty of food when it arrives. Trimagasi explains that he plans to cut strips of Goreng's flesh to sustain them both, but only in moderate amounts so he doesn't bleed out. On the eighth day, Trimagasi cuts into Goreng's leg but is attacked by Miharu as she comes down the platform. She frees Goreng and he kills Trimagasi. Miharu cuts some of Trimagasi's flesh, feeding Goreng and eating some herself before continuing down.\n\nThe following month, Goreng awakes on level 33 with a woman, Imoguiri, as a cellmate. The only thing she brought with her was her dog. Goreng recognizes her as the Administration official who interviewed him before sending him to the cells. She tells Goreng that she believes there are 200 floors. She says she was unaware of the horrible conditions and volunteered to try to fix things when she was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Imoguiri rations her food and attempts to convince those below to do so as well, but they ignore her until Goreng threatens to defecate in their food.\n\nGoreng encounters Miharu once again as she rides down on the platform but she appears critically injured, presumably from being in a fight on the higher levels. Goreng and Imoguiri grab her off the platform and tend to her wounds. Goreng explains to Imoguiri about Miharu's search for her child, but Imoguiri says nobody under the age of 16 is allowed into the facility and says Miharu entered alone. Goreng awakens to see Miharu and Imoguiri in a standoff, as Miharu has eaten Imoguiri's dog. Goreng awakens the following month on level 202 and finds that Imoguiri has hanged herself. Goreng eats her flesh to survive, experiencing hallucinations of her and Trimagasi instructing him to do so.\n\nHe then awakens the following month on level 6. His roommate, Baharat, attempts to climb up through the upper level with the help of those above using a rope he brought into the pit. The couple living on the level above first help him, but end up defecating in his face, and pushing him back down. Estimating that there are around 250 levels, Goreng makes a plan to ride the platform down, rationing the food so all get a share, and convinces Baharat to go with him. As they descend, they hand out portions to the prisoners, attacking those who refuse to cooperate. Going down, they encounter Miharu fighting two other residents and try to help her, but she is killed, they are severely injured themselves. Goreng and Baharat continue to descend, eventually passing level 250 and reaching level 333 where the platform stops. Goreng notices a child hiding under the bed, and assumes it is Miharu's son. He gets off the platform, followed hesitantly by Baharat, only to have the platform continue downward, leaving them behind. They then discover the child is actually a girl, who turns out to be Miharu's  daughter. Despite Baharat's reluctance, they feed her an untouched [[panna cotta]] they had been saving as a \"message\" for the Administrators at the top. \n\nGoreng passes out and dreams of Baharat telling him that \"the girl is the message.\" The next day, Goreng finds Baharat dead after succumbing to his injuries, and takes the child with him when the platform arrives; they descend to the bottom of the pit where he once again sees Trimagasi, who tells him that \"the message requires no bearer.\" Goreng gets off the platform and walks away with Trimagasi, both turning to watch as the girl is transported upwards.\n\n== Cast==\n[[File:El hoyo prentsaurrekoa rueda de prensa.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cast and crew members at a press conference in October 2019.]]\n* [[Iv\u00e1n Massagu\u00e9]] as ''Goreng'', named after ''[[:wiktionary:goreng|gor\u00e8ng]]'', which means \"fried\" in Malay/Indonesian.\n* Zorion Eguileor ([[:eu:Zorion_Egileor|eu]]) as ''Trimagasi'', named after terima kasih, which stands for \"thank you\" in Malay/Indonesian language\n* [[Antonia San Juan]] as ''Imoguiri'', named after ''[[Imogiri]]'', a royal graveyard in Indonesia. \n* [[Emilio Buale Coka]] as ''Baharat'', named after ''[[baharat]]'', a spice blend used in Turkish and Greek cuisine.\n* Alexandra Masangkay as ''Miharu'' \n* Eric L.

It took place on 29 March 1644 and resulted in the defeat of a [[Cavalier|Royalist]] army, which threw [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] onto the defensive for the remainder of the year.\n\n==Campaign==\nEarly in 1644, a Royalist army under [[Ralph Hopton, 1st Baron Hopton|Lord Hopton]] faced a Parliamentarian army under [[William Waller|Sir William Waller]] in the southern counties of England. After some reverses during the previous December, culminating in the [[Battle of Alton]], Hopton had withdrawn to [[Winchester]] to regroup and recruit. He was joined here by a detachment from the King's main \"Oxford Army\" under the [[Patrick Ruthven, 1st Earl of Brentford|Earl of Forth]], who unwillingly took command of the army. They resumed their advance eastward early in March.\n\nWaller's army of the \"Southern Association\" had also been reinforced by detachments from the main Parliamentarian army under the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] and the London Trained Bands, and was advancing westward from his winter quarters near [[Arundel]].  Forth and Hopton determined to seize [[New Alresford]], thus placing themselves between Waller and London.  They forestalled the Parliamentarian [[cavalry]] under Sir [[William Balfour (general)|William Balfour]], and occupied the town late on 27 March.\n\nOn 28 March, the Royalists advanced cautiously south from Alresford. An advanced guard under Sir [[Sir George Lisle|George Lisle]] occupied an outpost position near [[Cheriton, Hampshire|Cheriton]] as night fell, and reported that the Parliamentarians were retreating.\n\n==Battle==\nThe Parliamentarians had been outmanoeuvred up to this point, and had indeed begun to retreat, but overnight Waller changed his mind and ordered an advance.  As dawn broke, the City of London Brigade occupied Cheriton Wood.  Hopton had moved to Lisle's outpost, and realised that it would have to be hastily withdrawn.  The Royalists retreated to a ridge north of the wood, as Waller advanced.\n\nHopton was determined to recapture Cheriton Wood, and sent forward 1,000 \"commanded\" musketeers under a Colonel Appleyard, supported by a battery of guns.  There was some hot fighting, but the Parliamentarians abandoned the wood.  Forth and Hopton intended to stand on the defensive at this point, but an impetuous infantry commander, [[Henry Bard|Sir Henry Bard]], launched his [[Sir Henry Bard's regiment of Foote|regiment of foot]] against the Parliamentarian left wing horse.  Bard's regiment was overwhelmed and destroyed by a charge from Sir Arthur Haselrig's regiment of horse. (This was not his famed Cuirassier regiment which had been destroyed at Roundway Down some 8 months earlier, instead the regiment had been rebuilt as 'regular' cavalry since September 1643). The Royalist cavalry on the right wing tried to support him, but were forced to make disjointed attacks along narrow lanes and were defeated in turn.\n\nHopton sent the Royalist horse from the left wing under Sir Edward Stawell to make a better prepared attack, but they were also defeated. Haselrig's regiment now attacked the Royalist foot moving up in support, and drove them back.  The Parliamentarians also attacked the Royalist left, which had been denuded of its horse, and regained Cheriton Wood.\n\nThe Royalists fell back to their ridge, but Hopton and Forth realised they could not withstand a deliberate Parliamentarian attack the next day. As evening fell, the Royalists retreated to [[Basing House]],<ref>Newman, p. 49.</ref> having lost many brave cavaliers including their Lieutenant General of Horse: Lord John Stuart, Major General of Horse: Sir John Smith, Sir Edward Stowell and Henry Sandys of the Vyne, grandson of William, Fourth Lord Sandys.<ref>MacLean, p. 143.</ref> In addition to these casualties, Raoul Fleury (c/o of the Queens Regiment) and the aforementioned Sir Henry Bard were both badly wounded.\n\n==Results==\nThe defeat of Forth's and Hopton's army left the King's plans of a thrust into Sussex and Kent in tatters. It also allowed the Parliamentarian armies of Essex and Waller to concentrate against the King at Oxford.

It took place on 29 March 1644 and resulted in the defeat of a [[Cavalier|Royalist]] army, which threw [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] onto the defensive for the remainder of the year.\n\n==Campaign==\nEarly in 1644, a Royalist army under [[Ralph Hopton, 1st Baron Hopton|Lord Hopton]] faced a Parliamentarian army under [[William Waller|Sir William Waller]] in the southern counties of England. After some reverses during the previous December, culminating in the [[Battle of Alton]], Hopton had withdrawn to [[Winchester]] to regroup and recruit. He was joined here by a detachment from the King's main \"Oxford Army\" under the [[Patrick Ruthven, 1st Earl of Brentford|Earl of Forth]], who unwillingly took command of the army.  They resumed their advance eastward early in March.\n\nWaller's army of the \"Southern Association\" had also been reinforced by detachments from the main Parliamentarian army under the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] and the London Trained Bands, and was advancing westward from his winter quarters near [[Arundel]].  Forth and Hopton determined to seize [[New Alresford]], thus placing themselves between Waller and London.  They forestalled the Parliamentarian [[cavalry]] under Sir [[William Balfour (general)|William Balfour]], and occupied the town late on 27 March.\n\nOn 28 March, the Royalists advanced cautiously south from Alresford. An advanced guard under Sir [[Sir George Lisle|George Lisle]] occupied an outpost position near [[Cheriton, Hampshire|Cheriton]] as night fell, and reported that the Parliamentarians were retreating.\n\n==Battle==\nThe Parliamentarians had been outmanoeuvred up to this point, and had indeed begun to retreat, but overnight Waller changed his mind and ordered an advance.  As dawn broke, the City of London Brigade occupied Cheriton Wood.  Hopton had moved to Lisle's outpost, and realised that it would have to be hastily withdrawn.  The Royalists retreated to a ridge north of the wood, as Waller advanced.\n\nHopton was determined to recapture Cheriton Wood, and sent forward 1,000 \"commanded\" musketeers under a Colonel Appleyard, supported by a battery of guns.  There was some hot fighting, but the Parliamentarians abandoned the wood.  Forth and Hopton intended to stand on the defensive at this point, but an impetuous infantry commander, [[Henry Bard|Sir Henry Bard]], launched his [[Sir Henry Bard's regiment of Foote|regiment of foot]] against the Parliamentarian left wing horse.  Bard's regiment was overwhelmed and destroyed by a charge from Sir Arthur Haselrig's regiment of horse. (This was not his famed Cuirassier regiment which had been destroyed at Roundway Down some 8 months earlier, instead the regiment had been rebuilt as 'regular' cavalry since September 1643). The Royalist cavalry on the right wing tried to support him, but were forced to make disjointed attacks along narrow lanes and were defeated in turn.\n\nHopton sent the Royalist horse from the left wing under [[Sir Edward Stawell]] to make a better prepared attack, but they were also defeated. Haselrig's regiment now attacked the Royalist foot moving up in support, and drove them back.  The Parliamentarians also attacked the Royalist left, which had been denuded of its horse, and regained Cheriton Wood.\n\nThe Royalists fell back to their ridge, but Hopton and Forth realised they could not withstand a deliberate Parliamentarian attack the next day.  As evening fell, the Royalists retreated to [[Basing House]],<ref>P. R. Newman, \"Atlas of the English Civil Wars\", 44-5.</ref> having lost many brave cavaliers including their Lieutenant General of Horse: Lord John Stuart, Major General of Horse: Sir John Smith, Sir Edward Stowell and Henry Sandys of the Vyne, grandson of William, Fourth Lord Sandys.<ref>Refer: \"The Visitation of Gloucestershire 1623\" etc., edited by Sir John MacLean, F.S.A., and W.C.Heane, M.R.C.S., London, 1885, p.143.</ref> In addition to these casualties, Raoul Fleury (c/o of the Queens Regiment) and the aforementioned Sir Henry Bard were both badly wounded.\n\n==Results==\nThe defeat of Forth's and Hopton's army left the King's plans of a thrust into Sussex and Kent in tatters. It also allowed the Parliamentarian armies of Essex and Waller to concentrate against the King at Oxford. The king merged the remnants of Hopton's army into his own at the review held at Aldbourne during April 1644. The infantry was formed into a single brigade under Sir Bernard Astley while most of the cavalry was formed into Sir Humphrey Bennett's brigade, with other remnants joining Lord Wilmot's brigade.\n\nAlthough Charles was able to partly restore the situation later in 1644 by gaining victories at [[Battle of Cropredy Bridge|Cropredy Bridge]] and [[Battle of Lostwithiel|Lostwithiel]], the Royalists could never again resume the offensive in the south of England.<ref>J Barratt, \"Cavalier Generals\", 209.</ref> The prominent Royalist statesman, the [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Earl of Clarendon]], considered the battle a disaster.<ref>J Barratt, \"Cavalier Generals\", 14.</ref>\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Cite book|author=Adair, John Eric|year=1973|title=Cheriton 1644: The Campaign and the Battle|publisher=Roundwood Press|location=Kineton, Warwickshire, England|isbn=978-0-900093-19-7}}\n* Barratt, John, ''Cavalier Generals: Charles I and His Commanders during the English Civil War 1642-46'' (2000; 2004)\n* {{Cite book|author=Gardiner, Samuel Rawson|year=1987|title=History of the Great Civil War, Volume 1 1642&ndash;44|publisher=Windrush Press|location=London|isbn=978-0-900075-00-1}} Note: republished from first edition, Longmans, London, 1886\n* {{Cite book|authorlink = George Nelson Godwin|last=Godwin|first=G.
