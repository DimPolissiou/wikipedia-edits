The route travels from [[Massachusetts Route 12|Route 12]] in [[West Boylston, Massachusetts|West Boylston]] in Central Massachusetts to [[U.S. Route 1 in Massachusetts|U.S. Route 1]] (US 1) and [[Massachusetts Route 1A|Route 1A]] in [[Salisbury, Massachusetts|Salisbury]] near the coast. Route 110 is paralleled by [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 495]] (I-495) for most of its length, and interchanges with the freeway several times along its journey.\n\n==Route description==\nRoute 110 begins at [[Massachusetts Route 12|Route 12]] in [[West Boylston, Massachusetts|West Boylston]], just north of the [[Wachusett Reservoir]] and the border with [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]]. The route follows north of the reservoir, passing through [[Sterling, Massachusetts|Sterling]] before entering [[Clinton, Massachusetts|Clinton]]. In Clinton, Route 110 shares a quarter-mile concurrency with [[Massachusetts Route 62|Route 62]] and [[Massachusetts Route 70|Route 70]] before heading northward, crossing the [[Nashua River]] and passing through [[Lancaster, Massachusetts|Lancaster]].\n\nThe route continues into [[Bolton, Massachusetts|Bolton]], crossing [[Massachusetts Route 117|Route 117]] and passing the Bolton Flats before entering the town of [[Harvard, Massachusetts|Harvard]].  Route 110 continues through the village of [[Still River, Massachusetts|Still River]], wrapping around Bare Hill Pond before joining [[Massachusetts Route 111|Route 111]], starting a 3.7-mile long concurrency which crosses [[Massachusetts Route 2|Route 2]] at Exit 38, just east of [[Fort Devens]].  The concurrency with Route 111 ends in [[Ayer, Massachusetts|Ayer]] in [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Middlesex County]] at a rotary junction with [[Massachusetts Route 2A|Route 2A]], where Route 110 begins a concurrency with Route 2A eastward into [[Littleton, Massachusetts|Littleton]].\n\nIn Littleton, Routes 110 and 2A cross the [[Fitchburg Line]] railroad tracks before meeting [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|I-495]] at Exit 30, beginning Route 110's long relationship with the interstate.  At [[Massachusetts Route 119|Route 119]]. Route 2A leaves Route 110 to head eastward, with Route 110 entering [[Westford, Massachusetts|Westford]].  In Westford, Route 110 shares a short concurrency with [[Massachusetts Route 225|Route 225]] before continuing just south of I-495, accessing the highway again off of Boston Road.  Route 110 enters [[Chelmsford, Massachusetts|Chelmsford]], meeting [[Massachusetts Route 4]] and the western end of [[Massachusetts Route 129|Route 129]] at the center of town, just north of the northern end of [[Massachusetts Route 27|Route 27]].  Route 110 then crosses I-495 at Exit 34, and then shortly meets [[U.S. Route 3]] at Exit 31, just as Route 110 enters the city of [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]].\n\nIn Lowell, Route 110 joins [[Massachusetts Route 3A|Route 3A]] near the [[Lowell (MBTA station)|Gallagher Transit Center]] and just north of the northern end of the [[Lowell Connector]].  Route 110 continues eastward, meeting the western end of [[Massachusetts Route 133|Route 133]] at [[Massachusetts Route 38|Route 38]], joining Route 38 to head northward across the [[Merrimack River]] via the Hunts Falls Bridge.  Just north of the bridge the two routes split at a rotary, with Route 38 heading west and Route 110 heading east, following the northern bank of the Merrimack on a two-lane road through [[Dracut, Massachusetts|Dracut]] and into [[Methuen, Massachusetts|Methuen]].  Up until approximately 1997, the Methuen section was a four-lane road; its total length as a four-lane road was the same as the modern two-lane road is. The change to being a two-lane road thus was most likely due to safety.\n\n[[Image:MA Route 110 northbound in Still River MA.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Northbound in Still River]]\nIn Methuen, Route 110 meets [[Massachusetts Route 113|Route 113]] at an interchange with [[Interstate 93]] at Exit 46, splitting from Route 113 quickly, with Route 110 heading eastward into the city of [[Lawrence, Massachusetts|Lawrence]].  Route 110 crosses [[Massachusetts Route 28|Route 28]] before heading along the north side of [[Campagnone Common]] before turning northward along Jackson Street.  It then heads back into Methuen and turns eastward again along Swan Street, heading towards another junction with I-495 at Exit 46.  The route then junctions Route 113 again before crossing under I-495 without junction before entering [[Haverhill, Massachusetts|Haverhill]].\n\nIn Haverhill, Routes 110 and 113 bend around the Merrimack, meeting I-495 again at Exit 49. The routes follow the banks of the Merrimack until Route 110 turns northward along Emerson Street. It crosses [[Massachusetts Route 97|Route 97]] before having a brief concurrency with [[Massachusetts Route 125|Route 125]], turning northward. The route passes Winnekenni Park and Kenoza Lake at the junction with [[Massachusetts Route 108|Route 108]] before crossing I-495 again at Exit 52. Route 110 then heads into [[Merrimac, Massachusetts|Merrimac]], acting as the main street through that town before entering [[Amesbury, Massachusetts|Amesbury]]. In Amesbury, Route 110 junctions [[Massachusetts Route 150|Route 150]] and I-495 at its last exit (Exit 55) before crossing [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|I-95]] at exit 58 and entering [[Salisbury, Massachusetts|Salisbury]]. Between these two interstates, Route 110 carries the traffic from one to the other as there is no direct access from 495 north to 95 south or 95 north to 495 south.  The route finally ends at [[U.S. Route 1 in Massachusetts|U.S. Route 1]] (known locally as Bridge Road) just south of where [[Massachusetts Route 1A|Route 1A]] leaves it for the last time, {{convert|2.5|mi}} west of Salisbury Beach and the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n==Major intersections==\n{{jcttop|length_ref=}}\n{{MAint\n|county=Worcester\n|cspan=6\n|location=West Boylston\n|mile=0.00\n|road={{jct|state=MA|MA|12|city1=Sterling|city2=Worcester}}\n|notes=Western terminus}}\n{{MAint\n|location=Clinton\n|lspan=2\n|mile=5.5\n|type=concur\n|road={{jct|state=MA|MA|62|dir1=east|MA|70|dir2=south|city1=Berlin|city2=Boylston}}\n|notes=Western end of Route 62/Route 70 concurrency}}\n{{MAint\n|mile=5.8\n|type=concur\n|road={{jct|state=MA|MA|62|dir1=west|MA|70|dir2=north|city1=Princeton|city2=Lancaster}}\n|notes=Eastern end of Route 62/Route 70 concurrency}}\n{{MAint\n|location=Bolton\n|mile=9.4\n|road={{jct|state=MA|MA|117|city1=Stow|city2=Leominster}}\n|notes=}}\n{{MAint\n|location=Harvard\n|lspan=2\n|mile=14.4\n|type=concur\n|road={{jct|state=MA|MA|111|dir1=south|city1=Acton}}\n|notes=Western end of Route 111 concurrency}}\n{{MAint\n|mile=16.0\n|road={{jct|state=MA|MA|2|city1=Concord|city2=Boston|city3=Athol|city4=Greenfield}}\n|notes=Exit&nbsp;109 on Route 2 (old exit 38);

The route travels from [[Massachusetts Route 12|Route 12]] in [[West Boylston, Massachusetts|West Boylston]] in Central Massachusetts to [[U.S. Route 1 in Massachusetts|U.S. Route 1]] (US 1) and [[Massachusetts Route 1A|Route 1A]] in [[Salisbury, Massachusetts|Salisbury]] near the coast. Route 110 is paralleled by [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 495]] (I-495) for most of its length, and interchanges with the freeway several times along its journey.\n\n==Route description==\nRoute 110 begins at [[Massachusetts Route 12|Route 12]] in [[West Boylston, Massachusetts|West Boylston]], just north of the [[Wachusett Reservoir]] and the border with [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]]. The route follows north of the reservoir, passing through [[Sterling, Massachusetts|Sterling]] before entering [[Clinton, Massachusetts|Clinton]]. In Clinton, Route 110 shares a quarter-mile concurrency with [[Massachusetts Route 62|Route 62]] and [[Massachusetts Route 70|Route 70]] before heading northward, crossing the [[Nashua River]] and passing through [[Lancaster, Massachusetts|Lancaster]].\n\nThe route continues into [[Bolton, Massachusetts|Bolton]], crossing [[Massachusetts Route 117|Route 117]] and passing the Bolton Flats before entering the town of [[Harvard, Massachusetts|Harvard]].  Route 110 continues through the village of [[Still River, Massachusetts|Still River]], wrapping around Bare Hill Pond before joining [[Massachusetts Route 111|Route 111]], starting a 3.7-mile long concurrency which crosses [[Massachusetts Route 2|Route 2]] at Exit 38, just east of [[Fort Devens]].  The concurrency with Route 111 ends in [[Ayer, Massachusetts|Ayer]] in [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Middlesex County]] at a rotary junction with [[Massachusetts Route 2A|Route 2A]], where Route 110 begins a concurrency with Route 2A eastward into [[Littleton, Massachusetts|Littleton]].\n\nIn Littleton, Routes 110 and 2A cross the [[Fitchburg Line]] railroad tracks before meeting [[Interstate 495 (Massachusetts)|I-495]] at Exit 30, beginning Route 110's long relationship with the interstate.  At [[Massachusetts Route 119|Route 119]]. Route 2A leaves Route 110 to head eastward, with Route 110 entering [[Westford, Massachusetts|Westford]].  In Westford, Route 110 shares a short concurrency with [[Massachusetts Route 225|Route 225]] before continuing just south of I-495, accessing the highway again off of Boston Road.  Route 110 enters [[Chelmsford, Massachusetts|Chelmsford]], meeting [[Massachusetts Route 4]] and the western end of [[Massachusetts Route 129|Route 129]] at the center of town, just north of the northern end of [[Massachusetts Route 27|Route 27]].  Route 110 then crosses I-495 at Exit 34, and then shortly meets [[U.S. Route 3]] at Exit 31, just as Route 110 enters the city of [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]].\n\nIn Lowell, Route 110 joins [[Massachusetts Route 3A|Route 3A]] near the [[Lowell (MBTA station)|Gallagher Transit Center]] and just north of the northern end of the [[Lowell Connector]].  Route 110 continues eastward, meeting the western end of [[Massachusetts Route 133|Route 133]] at [[Massachusetts Route 38|Route 38]], joining Route 38 to head northward across the [[Merrimack River]] via the Hunts Falls Bridge.  Just north of the bridge the two routes split at a rotary, with Route 38 heading west and Route 110 heading east, following the northern bank of the Merrimack on a two-lane road through [[Dracut, Massachusetts|Dracut]] and into [[Methuen, Massachusetts|Methuen]].  Up until approximately 1997, the Methuen section was a four-lane road; its total length as a four-lane road was the same as the modern two-lane road is. The change to being a two-lane road thus was most likely due to safety.\n\n[[Image:MA Route 110 northbound in Still River MA.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Northbound in Still River]]\nIn Methuen, Route 110 meets [[Massachusetts Route 113|Route 113]] at an interchange with [[Interstate 93]] at Exit 46, splitting from Route 113 quickly, with Route 110 heading eastward into the city of [[Lawrence, Massachusetts|Lawrence]].  Route 110 crosses [[Massachusetts Route 28|Route 28]] before heading along the north side of [[Campagnone Common]] before turning northward along Jackson Street.  It then heads back into Methuen and turns eastward again along Swan Street, heading towards another junction with I-495 at Exit 46.  The route then junctions Route 113 again before crossing under I-495 without junction before entering [[Haverhill, Massachusetts|Haverhill]].\n\nIn Haverhill, Routes 110 and 113 bend around the Merrimack, meeting I-495 again at Exit 49. The routes follow the banks of the Merrimack until Route 110 turns northward along Emerson Street. It crosses [[Massachusetts Route 97|Route 97]] before having a brief concurrency with [[Massachusetts Route 125|Route 125]], turning northward. The route passes Winnekenni Park and Kenoza Lake at the junction with [[Massachusetts Route 108|Route 108]] before crossing I-495 again at Exit 52. Route 110 then heads into [[Merrimac, Massachusetts|Merrimac]], acting as the main street through that town before entering [[Amesbury, Massachusetts|Amesbury]]. In Amesbury, Route 110 junctions [[Massachusetts Route 150|Route 150]] and I-495 at its last exit (Exit 55) before crossing [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|I-95]] at exit 58 and entering [[Salisbury, Massachusetts|Salisbury]]. Between these two interstates, Route 110 carries the traffic from one to the other as there is no direct access from 495 north to 95 south or 95 north to 495 south.  The route finally ends at [[U.S. Route 1 in Massachusetts|U.S. Route 1]] (known locally as Bridge Road) just south of where [[Massachusetts Route 1A|Route 1A]] leaves it for the last time, {{convert|2.5|mi}} west of Salisbury Beach and the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n==Major intersections==\n{{jcttop|length_ref=}}\n{{MAint\n|county=Worcester\n|cspan=6\n|location=West Boylston\n|mile=0.00\n|road={{jct|state=MA|MA|12}}\n|notes=Western terminus}}\n{{MAint\n|location=Clinton\n|lspan=2\n|mile=5.5\n|type=concur\n|road={{jct|state=MA|MA|62|dir1=east|MA|70|dir2=south}}\n|notes=Western end of Route 62/Route 70 concurrency}}\n{{MAint\n|mile=5.8\n|type=concur\n|road={{jct|state=MA|MA|62|dir1=west|MA|70|dir2=north}}\n|notes=Eastern end of Route 62/Route 70 concurrency}}\n{{MAint\n|location=Bolton\n|mile=9.4\n|road={{jct|state=MA|MA|117|city1=Stow|city2=Leominster}}\n|notes=}}\n{{MAint\n|location=Harvard\n|lspan=2\n|mile=14.4\n|type=concur\n|road={{jct|state=MA|MA|111|dir1=south|city1=Acton}}\n|notes=Western end of Route 111 concurrency}}\n{{MAint\n|mile=16.0\n|road={{jct|state=MA|MA|2|city1=Concord|city2=Boston|city3=Athol|city4=Greenfield}}\n|notes=Exit&nbsp;109 on Route 2 (old exit 38);

However, in Europe, these tribunals were set up under the authority of the [[London Charter]], which only considered allegations of war crimes committed by people who acted in the interests of the [[Axis powers]].\n\nSome war crimes involving Allied personnel were investigated by the Allied powers and led in some instances to [[courts-martial]]. Some incidents alleged by historians to have been crimes under the law of war in operation at the time were, for a variety of reasons, not investigated by the Allied powers during the war, or were investigated and a decision was taken not to prosecute.\n\n==Policy==\nThe [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] claim that their [[militaries]] were directed to observe the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Conventions]] and [[Geneva Conventions]] and believed to be conducting a [[just war]] fought for defensive reasons.  Violations of the conventions did occur, however, including the forcible return of Soviet citizens who had been collaborating with Axis forces to the USSR at the end of the war. The military of the [[Soviet Union]] also frequently committed war crimes, which are today known to have been at the direction of its government.

Many men, some the very young and old, were killed resisting or trying to escape. Once collected, they would be roped or chained together and marched, with little food or water, long distances to camp. They often died or were killed along the way, sometimes less than 50 percent reaching camp alive. Then recruit camp was no better, with hospitals resembling Nazi concentration camps... Probably 3,081,000 died during the Sino-Japanese War; likely another 1,131,000 during the Civil War\u20144,212,000 dead in total.

That same year, efforts were taken by Allied high commanders to suppress \"take no prisoners\" attitudes,<ref name=Ferguson2004/> among their own personnel (as these were affecting intelligence gathering) and to encourage Japanese soldiers to surrender. Ferguson adds that measures by Allied commanders to improve the ratio of Japanese prisoners to Japanese dead, resulted in it reaching 1:7, by mid-1945. Nevertheless, taking no prisoners was still standard practice among US troops at the [[Battle of Okinawa]], in April\u2013June 1945.<ref name=Ferguson2004/>\n\n[[Ulrich A.

The article goes deeper into the matter and claims that the villagers' tale - true or not - is part of a 'dark, long-kept secret' the unraveling of which 'refocused attention on what historians say is one of the most widely ignored crimes of the war': \"the widespread rape of Okinawan women by American servicemen\".<ref>{{Cite news|last = Sims |first = Calvin |date = 1 June 2000 |title = 3 Dead Marines and a Secret of Wartime Okinawa |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/01/world/3-dead-marines-and-a-secret-of-wartime-okinawa.html |newspaper=The New York Times |location=Nago, Japan |access-date=6 April 2015 |quote= Still, the villagers' tale of a dark, long-kept secret has refocused attention on what historians say is one of the most widely ignored crimes of the war, the widespread rape of Okinawan women by American servicemen.}}</ref> Although Japanese reports of rape were largely ignored at the time, academic estimates have been that as many as 10,000 Okinawan women may have been raped. It has been claimed that the rape was so prevalent that most Okinawans over age 65 around the year 2000 either knew or had heard of a woman who was raped in the aftermath of the war. Military officials denied the mass rapings, and all surviving veterans refused ''The New York Times''' request for an interview.<ref name=\"okinawa\">{{Cite news|last = Sims |first = Calvin |date = 1 June 2000 |title = 3 Dead Marines and a Secret of Wartime Okinawa |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/01/world/3-dead-marines-and-a-secret-of-wartime-okinawa.html |newspaper=The New York Times |location=Nago, Japan |access-date=6 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nProfessor of East Asian Studies and expert on Okinawa Steve Rabson said: \"I have read many accounts of such rapes in Okinawan newspapers and books, but few people know about them or are willing to talk about them\". Books, diaries, articles and other documents refer to rapes by American soldiers of various races and backgrounds. Samuel Saxton, a retired captain, explained that the American veterans and witnesses may have believed: \"It would be unfair for the public to get the impression that we were all a bunch of rapists after we worked so hard to serve our country\". Masaie Ishihara, a sociology professor, supports this: \"There is a lot of historical amnesia out there, many people don't want to acknowledge what really happened\".<ref name=\"okinawa\"/>\n\nAn explanation given for why the US military has no record of any rapes is that few - if any - Okinawan women reported abuse, mostly out of fear and embarrassment. Those who did report them are believed by historians to have been ignored by the US military police. A large scale effort to determine the extent of such crimes has also never been called for. Over five decades after the war has ended the women who were believed to have been raped still refused to give a public statement, with friends, local historians and university professors who had spoken with the women instead saying they preferred not to discuss it publicly. According to a [[Nago, Okinawa]]n police spokesman: \"Victimized women feel too ashamed to make it public\".<ref name=\"okinawa\"/>\n\nIn his book \"Tennozan: The Battle of Okinawa and the Atomic Bomb\", George Feifer noted that by 1946 there had been fewer than 10 reported cases of rape in Okinawa. He explains that it was: \"partly because of shame and disgrace, partly because Americans were victors and occupiers\". Feifer claimed: \"In all there were probably thousands of incidents, but the victims' silence kept rape another dirty secret of the campaign.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Feifer |first=George |date=1992 |title=Tennozan: The Battle of Okinawa and the Atomic Bomb |location=Michigan |publisher=Ticknor & Fields |isbn=9780395599242 |url=https://archive.org/details/tennozanbattleof00feif }}</ref> Many people wondered why it never came to light after the inevitable American-Japanese babies the many women must have had. In interviews, historians and Okinawan elders said that some Okinawan women who were raped did give birth to biracial children, but that many of them were immediately killed or left behind out of shame, disgust or fearful trauma. More often, however, rape victims underwent crude abortions with the help of village midwives.<ref name=\"okinawa\"/>\n\nHowever, American professor of Japanese Studies Michael S. Molasky argues that Okinawan civilians \"were often surprised at the comparatively humane treatment they received from the American enemy.\"<ref>{{Cite book| url = https://books.google.com/?id=RMDt86cokDUC&pg=PA16 | title = The American Occupation of Japan and Okinawa: Literature and Memory | first = Michael S. | last = Molasky | page = 16 | isbn = 978-0-415-19194-4 | year = 1999}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book| url = https://books.google.com/?id=6xMuWmEsAcMC&pg=PA21 | title = Southern Exposure: Modern Japanese Literature from Okinawa | first = Michael S. | last = Molasky | first2 = Steve | last2 = Rabson | page = 22 | isbn = 978-0-8248-2300-9 | year = 2000}}</ref> According to ''Islands of Discontent: Okinawan Responses to Japanese and American Power'' by the American [[Mark Selden]], the Americans \"did not pursue a policy of [[torture]], rape, and murder of civilians as Japanese military officials had warned.\"<ref>{{Cite book| title = Islands of Discontent: Okinawan Responses to Japanese and American Power | first = Susan D | last = Sheehan | first2 = Laura | last2 = Elizabeth | first3 = Hein Mark | last3 = Selden | page = 18}}</ref>\n\n=====Post-war=====\n{{Main|Rape during the occupation of Japan}}\nThere were 1,336 reported rapes during the first 10 days of the occupation of [[Kanagawa Prefecture]] after the Japanese surrender.<ref name=\"Schrijvers_212\"/>\n\n==Comparative death rates of POWs==\nAccording to James D.

Many men, some the very young and old, were killed resisting or trying to escape. Once collected, they would be roped or chained together and marched, with little food or water, long distances to camp. They often died or were killed along the way, sometimes less than 50 percent reaching camp alive. Then recruit camp was no better, with hospitals resembling Nazi concentration camps... Probably 3,081,000 died during the Sino-Japanese War; likely another 1,131,000 during the Civil War\u20144,212,000 dead in total.

That same year, efforts were taken by Allied high commanders to suppress \"take no prisoners\" attitudes,<ref name=Ferguson2004/> among their own personnel (as these were affecting intelligence gathering) and to encourage Japanese soldiers to surrender. Ferguson adds that measures by Allied commanders to improve the ratio of Japanese prisoners to Japanese dead, resulted in it reaching 1:7, by mid-1945. Nevertheless, taking no prisoners was still standard practice among US troops at the [[Battle of Okinawa]], in April\u2013June 1945.<ref name=Ferguson2004/>\n\n[[Ulrich A.

Masaie Ishihara, a sociology professor, supports this: \"There is a lot of historical amnesia out there, many people don't want to acknowledge what really happened\".<ref name=\"okinawa\"/>\n\nAn explanation given for why the US military has no record of any rapes is that few - if any - Okinawan women reported abuse, mostly out of fear and embarrassment. Those who did report them are believed by historians to have been ignored by the US military police. A large scale effort to determine the extent of such crimes has also never been called for. Over five decades after the war has ended the women who were believed to have been raped still refused to give a public statement, with friends, local historians and university professors who had spoken with the women instead saying they preferred not to discuss it publicly. According to a [[Nago, Okinawa]]n police spokesman: \"Victimized women feel too ashamed to make it public\".<ref name=\"okinawa\"/>\n\nIn his book \"Tennozan: The Battle of Okinawa and the Atomic Bomb\", George Feifer noted that by 1946 there had been fewer than 10 reported cases of rape in Okinawa. He explains that it was: \"partly because of shame and disgrace, partly because Americans were victors and occupiers\". Feifer claimed: \"In all there were probably thousands of incidents, but the victims' silence kept rape another dirty secret of the campaign.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Feifer |first=George |date=1992 |title=Tennozan: The Battle of Okinawa and the Atomic Bomb |location=Michigan |publisher=Ticknor & Fields |isbn=9780395599242 |url=https://archive.org/details/tennozanbattleof00feif }}</ref> Many people wondered why it never came to light after the inevitable American-Japanese babies the many women must have had. In interviews, historians and Okinawan elders said that some Okinawan women who were raped did give birth to biracial children, but that many of them were immediately killed or left behind out of shame, disgust or fearful trauma. More often, however, rape victims underwent crude abortions with the help of village midwives.<ref name=\"okinawa\"/>\n\nHowever, American professor of Japanese Studies Michael S. Molasky argues that Okinawan civilians \"were often surprised at the comparatively humane treatment they received from the American enemy.\"<ref>{{Cite book| url = https://books.google.com/?id=RMDt86cokDUC&pg=PA16 | title = The American Occupation of Japan and Okinawa: Literature and Memory | first = Michael S. | last = Molasky | page = 16 | isbn = 978-0-415-19194-4 | year = 1999}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book| url = https://books.google.com/?id=6xMuWmEsAcMC&pg=PA21 | title = Southern Exposure: Modern Japanese Literature from Okinawa | first = Michael S. | last = Molasky | first2 = Steve | last2 = Rabson | page = 22 | isbn = 978-0-8248-2300-9 | year = 2000}}</ref> According to ''Islands of Discontent: Okinawan Responses to Japanese and American Power'' by the American [[Mark Selden]], the Americans \"did not pursue a policy of [[torture]], rape, and murder of civilians as Japanese military officials had warned.\"<ref>{{Cite book| title = Islands of Discontent: Okinawan Responses to Japanese and American Power | first = Susan D | last = Sheehan | first2 = Laura | last2 = Elizabeth | first3 = Hein Mark | last3 = Selden | page = 18}}</ref>\n\n=====Post-war=====\n{{Main|Rape during the occupation of Japan}}\nThere were 1,336 reported rapes during the first 10 days of the occupation of [[Kanagawa Prefecture]] after the Japanese surrender.<ref name=\"Schrijvers_212\"/>\n\n==Comparative death rates of POWs==\nAccording to James D.

Old Navy closed in 2007, as well as Gottschalks in 2009. [[Macy's]] replaced Gottschalks in 2010. [[Ross Stores]] announced that they would move from West Valley Mall to the former [[Linens 'n Things]] building in 2012, and Barnes & Noble announced it would close its store in late 2013. Homelife Furniture opened its doors in the space formerly occupied by Ross Dress for Less in the same year. A [[Sports Authority]] store replaced Barnes & Noble in 2014, then closed due to the chain's Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2016. This store has since been replaced by a budget gymnasium, that seems to be performing satisfactory. On November 7, 2019, it was announced that Sears would be closing this location a part of a plan to close 96 stores nationwide.

Cameron was an organizer from 1919 and edited ''The Socialist'' from 1920 to 1923.\n\n==Beliefs==\nDespite the party labelling itself [[Marxism|Marxist]], \"the Party's socialism in reality involved a loosely integrated body of ideas, largely British in origin or form\".<ref name=\"socialistdillema\">{{cite news |last1=Osborne |first1=Graeme |title=A Socialist Dilemma  |accessdate=26 March 2020 |work=Labour History |date=1978 |pages=112 |language=en |doi=10.2307/27508339}}</ref> \n\nThe Victorian Socialist Party in 1905 was \"was unique among Australian political organisations for its explicit opposition to racism\".<ref name=\"socialistdillema\" /> This was in conflict with the mainstream Labor movement which was in favor of the [[White Australian Policy]].<ref name=\"socialistdillema\" /> Party members such as Tom Mann and John Curtin took the stance of anti-imperialism and internationalism, while members such as Maurice Blackburn argued that Australia required a strong army to enforce the White Australia Policy.<ref name=\"socialistdillema\" />  However, after [[Tom Mann]]'s departure in 1909, the party began to less strongly oppose racism.<ref name=\"socialistdillema\" /> By 1921, after the foundation of the [[Communist Party of Australia]], the then secretary Robert Ross advocated a [[eugenics|eugenicist]] stance, stating to 'keep your races pure'.<ref name=\"socialistdillema\" />\n\nThe VSP did not primarily contest parliamentary elections, seeing itself mainly as a force for socialist education in the wider Labor movement.

A leading influence in the VSP's formation was the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[trade union]]ist [[Tom Mann]], who lived in Australia from 1903 to 1910. Its leading figure was [[Robert Samuel Ross]], a talented organiser and journalist. In 1907 it had about 2,000 members.<ref>{{cite web |title=Solidarity Forever, by Bertha Walker - Chapter 2, Tom Mann |url=https://www.solidarityforeverbook.com/cgi-bin/showchapter.pl?c=2 |website=www.solidarityforeverbook.com |accessdate=19 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1907, the VSP, plus similar groups in the other Australian states, came together in a loose federal organisation calling itself the Socialist Federation of Australia, but this never became a functioning national party. Like other socialist parties, the VSP supported the \"One Big Union\" campaign advocating a united national labour movement, but this objective was never achieved.\n\nThe [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] caused a crisis for the VSP. Like most socialists, the party initially welcomed the revolution, but by 1920 democratic socialists such as Ross had become critical of the [[Bolshevik]] regime. In 1921 a VSP member who had moved to [[Sydney]], Bill Earsman, was one of the founders of the [[Communist Party of Australia]].

A faction of the VSP hoped to \"[[boring from within|bore from within]]\" and win the ALP for socialism. Members who were later prominent included [[John Curtin]] ([[Prime Minister of Australia]] 1941\u201345), [[Frank Anstey]] (a federal Labor MP 1910\u201334), [[Maurice Blackburn]] (a federal MP 1934\u201343), [[Don Cameron (Victorian politician)|Don Cameron]] (a Senator 1938\u20131962), [[Fred Katz]] (a Senator 1947\u20131951),<ref>{{cite news|url=https://biography.senate.gov.au/katz-frederick-carl/|title=Katz, Frederick Carl (1877\u20131960)|work=The Biographical Dictionary of the Australian Senate|year=2004|volume=2|publisher=Melbourne University Press|first=Frank|last=Bongiorno|authorlink=Frank Bongiorno}}</ref> and [[John Cain (senior)|John Cain]] (three times [[Premier of Victoria]]). Cameron was an organizer from 1919 and edited ''The Socialist'' from 1920 to 1923.\n\n==Beliefs==\nDespite the party labelling itself [[Marxism|Marxist]], the \"the Party's socialism in reality involved a loosely integrated body of ideas, largely British in origin or form\".<ref name=\"socialistdillema\">{{cite news |last1=Osborne |first1=Graeme |title=A Socialist Dilemma  |accessdate=26 March 2020 |work=Labour History |date=1978 |pages=112 |language=en |doi=10.2307/27508339}}</ref> \n\nThe Victorian Socialist Party in 1905 was \"was unique among Australian political organisations for its explicit opposition to racism\".<ref name=\"socialistdillema\" /> This was in conflict with the mainstream Labor movement which was in favor of the [[White Australian Policy]].<ref name=\"socialistdillema\" /> Party members such as Tom Mann and John Curtin took the stance of anti-imperialism and internationalism, while members such as Maurice Blackburn argued that Australia required a strong army to enforce the White Australia Policy.<ref name=\"socialistdillema\" />  However, after [[Tom Mann]]'s departure in 1909, the party began to less strongly oppose racism.<ref name=\"socialistdillema\" /> By 1921, after the foundation of the [[Communist Party of Australia]], the then secretary Robert Ross advocated a [[eugenics|eugenicist]] stance, stating to 'keep your races pure'.<ref name=\"socialistdillema\" />\n\nThe VSP did not primarily contest parliamentary elections, seeing itself mainly as a force for socialist education in the wider Labor movement. The Victorian Socialist Party established a variety of cultural activities and institutions to form a community of socialists.<ref name=\"counterpublic\">{{cite journal |last1=Liam Byrne |title=Constructing a Socialist Community: The Victorian Socialist Party, Ritual, Pedagogy, and the Subaltern Counterpublic |journal=Labour History |date=2015 |issue=108 |pages=103 |doi=10.5263/labourhistory.108.0103}}</ref> These included more mainstream activities such as \"regular lectures on political topics, speakers classes, the writing and distribution of radical literature, and public protest\" to more eccentric such as \"dances, camps, bicycle riding clubs, choirs, a Sunday School for youth\".<ref name=\"counterpublic\" /> Despite the Victorian Socialist Party's rejection of independently running in elections, the party did contest the [[1908 Victorian state election]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Parliament of Victoria, Legislative Assembly election results for 29 December 1908 |url=http://elections.uwa.edu.au/elecdetail.lasso?keyvalue=885 |website=elections.uwa.edu.au |accessdate=20 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe party was founded in 1906 in [[Melbourne]] as a merger of a number of older socialist groupings. A leading influence in the VSP's formation was the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[trade union]]ist [[Tom Mann]], who lived in Australia from 1903 to 1910. Its leading figure was [[Robert Samuel Ross]], a talented organiser and journalist. In 1907 it had about 2,000 members.<ref>{{cite web |title=Solidarity Forever, by Bertha Walker - Chapter 2, Tom Mann |url=https://www.solidarityforeverbook.com/cgi-bin/showchapter.pl?c=2 |website=www.solidarityforeverbook.com |accessdate=19 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1907, the VSP, plus similar groups in the other Australian states, came together in a loose federal organisation calling itself the Socialist Federation of Australia, but this never became a functioning national party. Like other socialist parties, the VSP supported the \"One Big Union\" campaign advocating a united national labour movement, but this objective was never achieved.\n\nThe [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] caused a crisis for the VSP. Like most socialists, the party initially welcomed the revolution, but by 1920 democratic socialists such as Ross had become critical of the [[Bolshevik]] regime. In 1921 a VSP member who had moved to [[Sydney]], Bill Earsman, was one of the founders of the [[Communist Party of Australia]]. Many VSP members joined the new party, but the majority, led by Ross, remained aloof. \"The labour movement's championing of democratic rights and improved standards of life has so altered the Australian environment as to make Bolshevism inapplicable,\" he wrote.

These include the [[haiku]], [[Waka (poetry)|tanka]], and [[I Novel]], although modern writers generally avoid these writing styles. Historically, many works have sought to capture or codify traditional Japanese cultural values and aesthetics. Some of the most famous of these include [[Murasaki Shikibu]]'s ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' (1021), about [[Heian period|Heian]] court culture; [[Miyamoto Musashi]]'s ''[[The Book of Five Rings]]'' (1645), concerning military strategy; [[Matsuo Bash\u014d]]'s ''[[Oku no Hosomichi]]'' (1691), a [[Travel literature|travelogue]]; and [[Jun'ichir\u014d Tanizaki]]'s essay \"[[In Praise of Shadows]]\" (1933), which contrasts Eastern and Western cultures.\n\nFollowing the [[Black Ships|opening of Japan]] to the West in 1854, some works of this style were written in English by natives of Japan; they include ''[[Bushido: The Soul of Japan]]'' by [[Nitobe Inaz\u014d]] (1900), concerning ''[[samurai]]'' ethics, and ''[[The Book of Tea]]'' by [[Okakura Kakuz\u014d]] (1906), which deals with the philosophical implications of the [[Japanese tea ceremony]]. Western observers have often attempted to evaluate Japanese society as well, to varying degrees of success; one of the most well-known and controversial works resulting from this is [[Ruth Benedict]]'s ''[[The Chrysanthemum and the Sword]]'' (1946).\n\nTwentieth-century Japanese writers recorded changes in Japanese society through their works. Some of the most notable authors included [[Natsume S\u014dseki]], [[Jun'ichir\u014d Tanizaki]], [[Osamu Dazai]], [[Fumiko Enchi]], [[Akiko Yosano]], [[Yukio Mishima]], and [[Ry\u014dtar\u014d Shiba]]. Popular contemporary authors such as [[Ry\u016b Murakami]], [[Haruki Murakami]], and [[Banana Yoshimoto]] have been translated into many languages and enjoy international followings, and [[Yasunari Kawabata]] and [[Kenzabur\u014d \u014ce]] were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].\n\n==Arts==\n{{Main|Japanese art|Japanese architecture}}\n[[File:Red Fuji southern wind clear morning.jpg|thumb|The print ''[[Fine Wind, Clear Morning|Red Fuji]]'' from [[Hokusai|Katsushika Hokusai]]'s series, ''[[Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji]]'']]\nDecorative arts in Japan date back to prehistoric times. [[J\u014dmon pottery]] includes examples with elaborate ornamentation. In the [[Yayoi period]], artisans produced mirrors, spears, and ceremonial bells known as ''[[d\u014dtaku]].'' Later burial mounds, or ''[[kofun]],'' preserve characteristic clay ''[[haniwa]],'' as well as wall paintings.\n\nBeginning in the [[Nara period]], painting, [[Japanese calligraphy|calligraphy]], and [[Japanese sculpture|sculpture]] flourished under strong Confucian and Buddhist influences from [[Japanese missions to Tang China|China]]. Among the architectural achievements of this period are the [[H\u014dry\u016b-ji]] and the [[Yakushi-ji]], two [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] temples in [[Nara Prefecture]]. After the cessation of official relations with the [[Tang dynasty]] in the ninth century, Japanese art and architecture gradually became less influenced by China. Extravagant art and clothing was commissioned by nobles to decorate their court, and although the aristocracy was quite limited in size and power, many of these pieces are still extant. After the [[T\u014ddai-ji]] was attacked and burned during the [[Genpei War]], a special office of restoration was founded, and the T\u014ddai-ji became an important artistic center. The leading masters of the time were [[Unkei]] and [[Kaikei]].{{cn|date=December 2018}}\n\nPainting advanced in the [[Muromachi period]] in the form of [[ink wash painting]] under the influence of [[Zen Buddhism]] as practiced by such masters as [[Sessh\u016b T\u014dy\u014d]]. Zen Buddhist tenets were also elaborated into the [[tea ceremony]] during the [[Sengoku period]]. During the [[Edo period]], the polychrome painting screens of the [[Kan\u014d school]] were made influential thanks to their powerful patrons (including the [[Tokugawa clan|Tokugawas]]). Popular artists created ''[[ukiyo-e]]'', woodblock prints for sale to commoners in the flourishing cities. Pottery such as [[Imari ware]] was highly valued as far away as Europe.\n\nIn theater, [[Noh]] is a traditional, spare dramatic form that developed in tandem with [[ky\u014dgen]] farce. In stark contrast to the restrained refinement of noh, [[kabuki]], an \"explosion of color\", uses every possible stage trick for dramatic effect. Plays include sensational events such as suicides, and many such works were performed in both kabuki and [[bunraku]] puppet theaters.{{cn|date=December 2018}}\n\nSince the [[Meiji Restoration]], Japan has absorbed elements of Western culture and has given them a \"Japanese\" feel or modification into it. Its modern decorative, practical and performing arts works span a spectrum ranging from the traditions of Japan to purely Western modes. Products of popular culture, including [[J-pop]], [[Japanese rock|J-rock]], [[manga]] and [[anime]] have found audiences and fans around the world.\n\n==History==\n===Theories of origins===\n<!-- NOTE: THIS IS A SUMMARY SECTION providing a broad overview of various prominent theories of origins.

Following a population expansion in [[Neolithic]] times, these newcomers then found their way to the Japanese archipelago sometime during the Yayoi period. As a result, admixture was common in the island regions of [[Ky\u016bsh\u016b]], [[Shikoku]], and [[Honsh\u016b]], but did not prevail in the outlying islands of [[Okinawa]] and [[Hokkaid\u014d]], and the Ryukyuan and Ainu people continued to dominate there.

The J\u014dmon people were [[Mesolithic]] hunter-gatherers, though at least one middle to late J\u014dmon site ({{nihongo|Minami Mizote|\u5357\u6e9d\u624b}}, ca. 1200\u20131000 BC) had a primitive rice-growing [[agriculture]].

The more productive [[paddy field]] systems allowed the communities to support larger populations and spread over time, in turn becoming the basis for more advanced [[institution]]s and heralding the new [[civilization]] of the succeeding [[Kofun period]].\n\nThe estimated population of Japan in the late J\u014dmon period was about one hundred thousand, compared to about three million by the [[Nara period]].

Today, the largest form of Buddhism among Japanese people is the [[J\u014ddo Shinsh\u016b]] sect founded by [[Shinran]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.e-stat.go.jp/stat-search/files?page=1&layout=datalist&toukei=00401101&kikan=00401&tstat=000001018471&cycle=0&tclass1=000001111515&stat_infid=000031662957|title=\u5b97\u6559\u7d71\u8a08\u8abf\u67fb / \u5e73\u6210\uff12\uff19\u5e74\u5ea6 (Japanese government statistics on total religious followers for 2017)|website=e-stat.go.jp|accessdate=March 31, 2018}}</ref>\n\nA large majority of Japanese people profess to believe in both Shinto and Buddhism.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ja.html#People|title=The World Factbook \u2014 Central Intelligence Agency|website=Cia.gov|accessdate=December 12, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71342.htm|title=Japan|website=State.gov|accessdate=December 12, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vipassanafoundation.com/Buddhists.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040704135418/http://www.vipassanafoundation.com/Buddhists.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 4, 2004|title=Buddhists in the world|date=July 4, 2004|accessdate=December 12, 2017}}</ref> Japanese people's religion functions mostly as a foundation for [[mythology]], [[tradition]]s, and neighborhood activities, rather than as the single source of moral guidelines for one's life.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nAbout one million, or slightly under 1%, of Japan's population are [[Christianity in Japan|Christians]].<ref name=\"Mariko Kato\">{{cite news|title=Christianity's long history in the margins|url= http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2009/02/24/reference/christianitys-long-history-in-the-margins/|work=[[The Japan Times]]|date=February 24, 2009|author=Mariko Kato|quote=The Christian community itself counts only those who have been baptized and are currently regular churchgoers \u2014 some 1 million people, or less than 1 percent of the population, according to Nobuhisa Yamakita, moderator of the United Church of Christ in Japan}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Mission Network News]]|title=Christians use English to reach Japanese youth|date=September 3, 2007|url=http://mnnonline.org/article/10318|quote=The population of Japan is less than one-percent Christian|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611060608/http://mnnonline.org/article/10318|archivedate=June 11, 2010}}</ref> A larger proportion of members of the [[Japanese diaspora]] practice Christianity; about 60% of [[Japanese Brazilians]] and 90% of [[Japanese Mexican]]s are [[Roman Catholic]]s,<ref name=\"panib.org.br\">{{cite web|url=http://panib.org.br/|title=PANIB - Pastoral Nipo Brasileira|date=October 15, 2007|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015201123/http://panib.org.br/|archivedate=October 15, 2007}}</ref><ref name=\"Aciprensa\">{{cite web|url= https://www.aciprensa.com/noticias/colonia-japonesa-en-mexico-visita-guadalupe-en-54-peregrinacion-anual/ |title= Colonia japonesa en M\u00e9xico visita Guadalupe en 54\u00ba peregrinaci\u00f3n anual |publisher=Aciprensa|accessdate= February 20, 2014}}</ref> while about 37% of [[Japanese Americans]] are Christians (33% [[Protestant]] and 4% [[Catholic]]).<ref name=\"pewforum.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/Asian-Americans-A-Mosaic-of-Faiths-overview.aspx|title=Asian Americans: A Mosaic of Faiths|date=July 19, 2012|work=Pew Research Center's Religion & Public Life Project|accessdate=March 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Literature==\n{{Main|Japanese literature}}\n[[File:Momotaro2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|[[Bisque doll]] of [[Momotar\u014d]],<br />a character from [[Japanese literature]] and [[Japanese folklore|folklore]]]]\nCertain genres of writing originated in and are often associated with Japanese society. These include the [[haiku]], [[Waka (poetry)|tanka]], and [[I Novel]], although modern writers generally avoid these writing styles. Historically, many works have sought to capture or codify traditional Japanese cultural values and aesthetics. Some of the most famous of these include [[Murasaki Shikibu]]'s ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' (1021), about [[Heian period|Heian]] court culture; [[Miyamoto Musashi]]'s ''[[The Book of Five Rings]]'' (1645), concerning military strategy; [[Matsuo Bash\u014d]]'s ''[[Oku no Hosomichi]]'' (1691), a [[Travel literature|travelogue]]; and [[Jun'ichir\u014d Tanizaki]]'s essay \"[[In Praise of Shadows]]\" (1933), which contrasts Eastern and Western cultures.\n\nFollowing the [[Black Ships|opening of Japan]] to the West in 1854, some works of this style were written in English by natives of Japan; they include ''[[Bushido: The Soul of Japan]]'' by [[Nitobe Inaz\u014d]] (1900), concerning ''[[samurai]]'' ethics, and ''[[The Book of Tea]]'' by [[Okakura Kakuz\u014d]] (1906), which deals with the philosophical implications of the [[Japanese tea ceremony]]. Western observers have often attempted to evaluate Japanese society as well, to varying degrees of success; one of the most well-known and controversial works resulting from this is [[Ruth Benedict]]'s ''[[The Chrysanthemum and the Sword]]'' (1946).\n\nTwentieth-century Japanese writers recorded changes in Japanese society through their works. Some of the most notable authors included [[Natsume S\u014dseki]], [[Jun'ichir\u014d Tanizaki]], [[Osamu Dazai]], [[Fumiko Enchi]], [[Akiko Yosano]], [[Yukio Mishima]], and [[Ry\u014dtar\u014d Shiba]]. Popular contemporary authors such as [[Ry\u016b Murakami]], [[Haruki Murakami]], and [[Banana Yoshimoto]] have been translated into many languages and enjoy international followings, and [[Yasunari Kawabata]] and [[Kenzabur\u014d \u014ce]] were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].\n\n==Arts==\n{{Main|Japanese art|Japanese architecture}}\n[[File:Red Fuji southern wind clear morning.jpg|thumb|The print ''[[Fine Wind, Clear Morning|Red Fuji]]'' from [[Hokusai|Katsushika Hokusai]]'s series, ''[[Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji]]'']]\nDecorative arts in Japan date back to prehistoric times. [[J\u014dmon pottery]] includes examples with elaborate ornamentation. In the [[Yayoi period]], artisans produced mirrors, spears, and ceremonial bells known as ''[[d\u014dtaku]].'' Later burial mounds, or ''[[kofun]],'' preserve characteristic clay ''[[haniwa]],'' as well as wall paintings.\n\nBeginning in the [[Nara period]], painting, [[Japanese calligraphy|calligraphy]], and [[Japanese sculpture|sculpture]] flourished under strong Confucian and Buddhist influences from [[Japanese missions to Tang China|China]]. Among the architectural achievements of this period are the [[H\u014dry\u016b-ji]] and the [[Yakushi-ji]], two [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] temples in [[Nara Prefecture]]. After the cessation of official relations with the [[Tang dynasty]] in the ninth century, Japanese art and architecture gradually became less influenced by China. Extravagant art and clothing was commissioned by nobles to decorate their court, and although the aristocracy was quite limited in size and power, many of these pieces are still extant. After the [[T\u014ddai-ji]] was attacked and burned during the [[Genpei War]], a special office of restoration was founded, and the T\u014ddai-ji became an important artistic center. The leading masters of the time were [[Unkei]] and [[Kaikei]].{{cn|date=December 2018}}\n\nPainting advanced in the [[Muromachi period]] in the form of [[ink wash painting]] under the influence of [[Zen Buddhism]] as practiced by such masters as [[Sessh\u016b T\u014dy\u014d]]. Zen Buddhist tenets were also elaborated into the [[tea ceremony]] during the [[Sengoku period]]. During the [[Edo period]], the polychrome painting screens of the [[Kan\u014d school]] were made influential thanks to their powerful patrons (including the [[Tokugawa clan|Tokugawas]]). Popular artists created ''[[ukiyo-e]]'', woodblock prints for sale to commoners in the flourishing cities. Pottery such as [[Imari ware]] was highly valued as far away as Europe.\n\nIn theater, [[Noh]] is a traditional, spare dramatic form that developed in tandem with [[ky\u014dgen]] farce. In stark contrast to the restrained refinement of noh, [[kabuki]], an \"explosion of color\", uses every possible stage trick for dramatic effect. Plays include sensational events such as suicides, and many such works were performed in both kabuki and [[bunraku]] puppet theaters.{{cn|date=December 2018}}\n\nSince the [[Meiji Restoration]], Japan has absorbed elements of Western culture and has given them a \"Japanese\" feel or modification into it. Its modern decorative, practical and performing arts works span a spectrum ranging from the traditions of Japan to purely Western modes. Products of popular culture, including [[J-pop]], [[Japanese rock|J-rock]], [[manga]] and [[anime]] have found audiences and fans around the world.\n\n==History==\n===Theories of origins===\n<!-- NOTE: THIS IS A SUMMARY SECTION providing a broad overview of various prominent theories of origins.

Following a population expansion in [[Neolithic]] times, these newcomers then found their way to the Japanese archipelago sometime during the Yayoi period. As a result, admixture was common in the island regions of [[Ky\u016bsh\u016b]], [[Shikoku]], and [[Honsh\u016b]], but did not prevail in the outlying islands of [[Okinawa]] and [[Hokkaid\u014d]], and the Ryukyuan and Ainu people continued to dominate there.
