{"title_page": "Biostratigraphy", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=April 2007}}\n{{Paleontology}}\n'''Biostratigraphy''' is the branch of [[stratigraphy]] which focuses on correlating and assigning relative ages of rock [[Stratum|strata]] by using the [[fossil]] assemblages contained within them. Usually the aim is correlation, demonstrating that a particular [[Horizon (geology)|horizon]] in one geological section represents the same period of time as another horizon at some other section. The fossils are useful because [[sediment]]s of the same age can look completely different because of local variations in the [[Sedimentary depositional environment|sedimentary environment]]. For example, one section might have been made up of [[clay]]s and [[marl]]s while another has more [[chalk]]y [[limestone]]s, but if the fossil species recorded are similar, the two sediments are likely to have been laid down at the same time.\n\nBiostratigraphy originated in the early 19th century, where geologists recognized that the correlation of fossil assemblages between rocks of similar type but different age decreased as the difference in age increased.

[[micropaleontology|Microfossils]] such as [[acritarchs]], [[chitinozoa]]ns, [[conodont]]s, [[dinoflagellate]] cysts,  [[ostracods]], [[pollen]], [[spores]] and [[foraminifera]]ns are also frequently used. Different fossils work well for sediments of different ages; trilobites, for example, are particularly useful for sediments of [[Cambrian]] age. To work well, the fossils used must be widespread geographically, so that they can occur in many different places. They must also be short lived as a species, so that the period of time during which they could be incorporated in the sediment is relatively narrow. The longer lived the species, the poorer the stratigraphic precision, so fossils that evolve rapidly, such as ammonites, are favored over forms that evolve much more slowly, like [[nautiloid]]s.  Often biostratigraphic correlations are based on a fauna, not an individual species, as this allows greater precision. Further, if only one species is present in a sample, it can mean that (1) the strata were formed in the known fossil range of that organism; (2) that the fossil range of the organism was incompletely known, and the strata extend the known fossil range.  For instance, the presence of the trace fossil ''[[Treptichnus pedum]]'' was used to define the base of the Cambrian period, but it has since been found in older strata.<ref>{{Cite journal\n  | last = Gehling\n  | first = James\n  | last2 = Jensen\n  | first2 = S\u00f6ren\n  | last3 = Droser\n  | first3 = Mary\n  | last4 = Myrow\n  | first4 = Paul\n  | last5 = Narbonne\n  | first5 = Guy\n  | title = Burrowing below the basal Cambrian GSSP, Fortune Head, Newfoundland\n  | journal = Geological Magazine\n  | volume = 138\n  | issue = 2\n  | pages = 213\u2013218\n  |date=March 2001\n  | doi = 10.1017/S001675680100509X\n  | id = 1\n}}</ref>\n\nFossil assemblages were traditionally used to designate the duration of periods.

Sheds vary considerably in their size and complexity of construction, from simple open-sided ones designed to cover bicycles or garden items to large wood-framed structures with shingled roofs, windows, and [[AC power plugs and sockets|electrical outlets]]. Sheds used on [[farm]]s or in industry can be large structures. The main types of shed construction are metal sheathing over a metal frame, plastic sheathing and frame, all-wood construction (the roof may be asphalt shingled or sheathed in tin), and vinyl-sided sheds built over a wooden frame. Small sheds may include a wooden or plastic floor, while more permanent ones may be built on a concrete pad or foundation. Sheds may be [[Lock and key|lockable]] to deter theft or entry by children, domestic animals, wildlife, etc.\n\nA culture of shed enthusiasts exists in several countries for people who enjoy building sheds and spending time in them for relaxation. In [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] there are magazines called ''The Shed'', an association for shed hobbyists (the [[Australian Men's Shed Association]]), and a book entitled ''Men and Sheds''.\n\n==Terminology==\nDepending on the region and type of use, a shed may also be called a [[shack]], [[Outhouse (disambiguation)|outhouse]], or \"outbuilding\". Sheds may be classified as \"accessory buildings\" in [[By-law#Municipal by-laws|municipal bylaws]] which may regulate their size, appearance, and distance from the principal building and boundary lines.\n\n== Uses ==\n[[File:Station Oudegem - Foto 3 (2009).png|thumb|A bicycle shed]]\n{{redirect2|Bicycle shed|Bike shed|\"the bicycle shed effect\"|Law of triviality}}\n{{redirect|Garden shed|the song|Garden Shed (song)}}\n{{redirect|Toolshed|the Tool demo album|72826}}\n\n* '''Agricultural sheds''' [[File:Hay shed.jpg|right|thumb|A hay shed typical of Australia and New Zealand (elsewhere often termed a \"[[barn]]\")]]\n**Arena sheds may have a simple open roof structure, or be partially walled or fully enclosed.  They are typically used as horse-riding equestrian venues, providing all-year usage of the facility with protection from the weather.\n** Farm sheds and other outbuildings are used to store farm equipment, tractors, tools, hay, and supplies, or to house horses, cattle, poultry or other farm animals. Run-in sheds are three-sided structures with an open face used for horses and cattle.\n** [[Shearing shed]]s can be large sheds found on sheep stations to accommodate large-scale [[sheep shearing]].\n\n* '''Bike sheds''' or '''bicycle sheds''' usually contain a framework on which bikes can be supported and locked and a roof to keep rain and/or snow off the bikes and their riders while mounting and dismounting. Bike sheds range from little more than a supported roof to more-complex structures with walls and locking doors or gates. The [[color of a bikeshed]] is the topic of a well-known adage about the challenges of group work in organizational psychology.\n\n* '''Boat sheds''' (or '''boatsheds''') {{Main|boatshed}} Boat sheds are typically lockable wooden sheds built near a body of water to store small private boats, bathing suits, life vests and related items.

The first train shed was built in 1830 at Liverpool's [[Crown Street Station]].\n** [[Snow shed]]s are strongly built timber or reinforced-concrete [[tunnel]]s that protect railroad tracks (or roads) from [[avalanche]]s.\n\n* '''Storage sheds''' may contain any items any person wishes to store and to organize and/or protect from precipitation, wind, small children, domestical animals, wildlife, etc.\n\n* '''Tool sheds''' may contain [[hand tool]]s and/or [[power tool]]s used to repair [[automobile]]s or for [[construction]].\n\n* '''Wood sheds''' are sheds used for storage of large quantities of [[firewood]]. Woodsheds help protect firewood from adverse weather and moisture, especially in snowy or wet climates. Woodsheds are commonly in close proximity to buildings heated by a [[wood-burning stove]], such as a [[log cabin]].

These kits are designed for regular people to be able to assemble themselves using commonly available tools (e.g., screwdriver). Both shed kits and [[DIY]] (do-it-yourself) plans are available for wooden and plastic sheds. Sheds are used to store home and garden [[tool]]s and equipment such as lawn tractors, and gardening supplies. In addition, sheds can be used to store items that are not suitable for indoor storage, such as petrol ([[gasoline]]), pesticides, or [[herbicide]]s. For homes with small gardens or modest storage needs, there are several types of very small sheds. The sheds not only use less ground area but also have a low profile less likely to obstruct the view or clash with the landscaping.\n\nThese small sheds include corner sheds, which fit into a corner (3&nbsp;ft tall&nbsp;\u00d7 3 wide&nbsp;\u00d7 2 deep, or about 1&nbsp;m tall&nbsp;\u00d7 1&nbsp;m wide&nbsp;\u00d7 50&nbsp;cm deep), vertical sheds ({{convert|5|x|3|x|4|ft|m|disp=x| deep, or |abbr=on|round=0.5}}), horizontal sheds ({{convert|3|x|5|x|4|ft|m|disp=or|abbr=on|round=0.5}}), and tool sheds. When a shed is used for tool storage, [[shelf (storage)|shelves]] and [[hook (wall)|hooks]] are often used to maximize the storage space.  [[Gambrel]]-style roofed sheds (sometimes called baby barns), which resemble a Dutch-style [[barn]], have a high sloping roofline which increases storage space in the \"loft\" area. Some Gambrel-styles have no loft and offer the advantage of reduced overall height.  Another style of small shed is the [[saltbox]]-style shed. \n\nMany sheds have either a pent or apex roof shape. A pent shed features a single roof section which is angled downwards to let rainwater run off, with more headroom at the front than the back. This is a simple, practical design that will fit particularly well next to a wall or fence. It is also usually lower than the typical apex shed, so could be a better choice if there are any height restrictions. A pent shed may be free-standing or attached to a wall (when it is known, unsurprisingly, as a wall shed).  \n\nAn apex shed has a pointed roof in an inverted V shape similar to the roof line of many houses. Two roof sections meet at a ridge in the middle, providing more headroom in the centre than at the sides. This type is generally regarded as a more attractive and traditional design, and may be preferable if the shed is going to be visible from the house. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.love2learnallotmenting.co.uk/wooden-shed-buying-guide|title=Wooden Shed Buying Guide - Love2Learn Allotmenting|website=Love2Learn Allotmenting|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-05-18|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701041626/http://www.love2learnallotmenting.co.uk/wooden-shed-buying-guide|archivedate=2016-07-01}}</ref> \n\nA twist on the standard apex shape is the reverse apex shed. In this design, the door is set in a side wall instead of the front. The main advantage of the reverse apex design is that the door opens into the widest part of the shed instead of the narrowest, so it's easier to reach into all areas to retrieve or store equipment.  <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wonkeedonkeeforestgarden.co.uk/forest-sheds/sheds-explained/|title=Sheds explained|website=www.wonkeedonkeeforestgarden.co.uk|access-date=2016-05-18|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160523075739/http://www.wonkeedonkeeforestgarden.co.uk/forest-sheds/sheds-explained/|archivedate=2016-05-23}}</ref>\n\n=== Larger domestic  ===\n[[File:TallShed.JPG|left|thumb|upright=0.90|A tall shed with windows and a shingled roof]]\nLarger, more-expensive sheds are typically constructed of [[wood]] and include features typically found in house construction, such as windows, a shingled roof, and electrical outlets. Larger sheds provide more space for engaging in hobbies such as [[gardening]], small [[internal combustion engine|engine]] repair, or [[tinkering]]. <!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed:  [[File:Typical shed.jpg|right|220px|thumb|A typical large domestic workshop shed]] -->Some sheds have small porches or include furniture, which allows them to be used for relaxation purposes. In some cases, [[Telecommuting|teleworkers]] and homeworkers in general who live in mild climates use small to medium-sized wooden garden sheds as outdoor offices. There is a growing industry in providing \"off the peg\" garden offices to cater for this demand, particularly in the UK but also in the US.\n \nShed owners can customize wooden sheds to match the features (e.g., siding, trim, etc.) of the main house. A number of decorative options can be added to sheds, such as [[dormer]]s, shutters, flowerboxes, finials, and [[weathervane]]s. As well, practical options can be added such as benches, ramps, ventilation systems (e.g., in cases where a swimming pool heater is installed in a shed), and electric lighting. Sheds designed for gardening, called \"potting sheds\", often feature windows or skylights for illumination, ventilation grilles, and a potter's bench for mixing soil and re-potting plants.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Materials===\nThe main types of shed construction are metal sheathing over a metal frame, plastic sheathing and frame, all-wood construction (wood frame, wood siding and wood roof), and vinyl-sided sheds built over a wooden frame. Each type has various advantages and disadvantages that a homeowner has to consider. For example, while metal sheds are fire and termite-resistant, they can rust over time, or be severely damaged by high winds or heavy snow loads. Wood sheds are easier to modify or customize than plastic or metal, because carpentry tools and basic carpentry skills are more readily available. Vinyl-sided, wood-framed sheds blend the strength of a wood frame with the maintenance-free aspect of vinyl siding (it does not need to be painted or varnished). The [[International Building Code]] (IBC) defines a shed as a building or structure of an accessory character; it classifies them under utility and miscellaneous group U (Chapter 3 Section 312).\n\n====Metal====\n[[File:Corrugated iron shed.jpg|thumb|right|A corrugated iron shed]]\nMetal sheds made from thin sheet metal sheathing ([[galvanized steel]], [[aluminium]], or corrugated iron) attached to a metal frame. Metal sheds are a good choice when long-term strength and resistance to fire, rot, or termites is desired. However, metal sheds may [[rust]] over time, particularly if they are constructed from steel that is not galvanized. Be aware that concrete is highly corrosive so care needs to be taken when assembling your shed to avoid contact with the outside panels.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalsheds.com.au/tips-on-erecting-a-shed/ |title=Tips on Kit Shed Assembly |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131194751/http://www.nationalsheds.com.au/tips-on-erecting-a-shed/ |archivedate=2011-01-31 }}</ref>\n\nAs well, some types of metal sheds that have thin walls are easily dented, which may makes some types of thin metal sheds a poor choice for vandal-prone areas or for high-traffic activities such as small businesses. In cold climates, metal sheds with thin walls need to have snow and ice cleared from the roof, because the thin metal may be damaged by a heavy accumulation. Since thin metal sheds weigh much less than wood or PVC plastic sheds, thin metal sheds are more at risk of being damaged by heavy winds. To prevent wind damage, thin metal sheds should be attached to a concrete foundation with screws.<ref>[http://www.hardware2u.com.au/absco-garden-sheds-for-sale-and-assemble-instructional-videos How to assemble a garden shed] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090803134029/http://www.hardware2u.com.au/absco-garden-sheds-for-sale-and-assemble-instructional-videos/ |date=2009-08-03 }}</ref> In countries where the climate is generally mild, such as Australia, very large metal sheds are used for many types of industry. Corrugated metal sheds may be better able to withstand wind and snow loads, as the corrugated shape makes the metal stronger than flat tin.\n\n====Plastic====\n[[File:Lifetimesheds.JPG|thumb|left|[[Lifetime Products|Lifetime]] brand blow-molded plastic sheds]]\n[[Plastic]] shed kits utilizing heavy molded plastics such as [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] and [[polyethylene]] may be less expensive than sheet-metal sheds. PVC resins and high-impact, [[Ultraviolet|UV light]]-resistant [[polyethylene]] make plastic outdoor sheds stronger, lighter, more durable, and more resistant to denting and chipping than wood, and tend to be more stable. Plastic shed kits sided with vinyl are typically among the least-expensive types of shed construction. Higher-quality sheds use UV-resistant plastic and [[powder coating|powder-coated]] metal frames. Many plastic sheds are modular to allow for easy extensions, peg-boards, shelving, attic-storage, windows, skylights, and other accessories to be added later, if these additions are purchased from the manufacturer.\n\nPlastic sheds are not susceptible to [[termite]] or wood-boring insect damage, and they require little maintenance. Being rot-proof they do not need to have preservative applied. This makes them preferable in climates where the weather can be changeable, such as the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@ethangardener/the-best-plastic-garden-storage-boxes-sheds-and-cupboards-8b8638635a83|title=The Best Plastic Garden Storage Boxes, Sheds and Cupboards|first=Ethan|last=Knight|date=28 October 2016|website=medium.com|accessdate=4 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220124414/https://medium.com/@ethangardener/the-best-plastic-garden-storage-boxes-sheds-and-cupboards-8b8638635a83|archivedate=20 December 2016}}</ref> Unlike wooden or metal sheds, which often require a permit to build, in many areas, plastic sheds do not. However, this is something property owners will need to verify. A call to your council/town's planning or building code office can provide information on permits.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.keter.com/tips-and-articles/shed-permit |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-22 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150303090023/http://www.keter.com/tips-and-articles/shed-permit |archivedate=2015-03-03 }}</ref>\n\n====Wood====\n[[File:Tool-shed.jpg|thumb|right|Domestic wooden sheds.]]\n[[File:Cedar storage shed wood.jpg|thumb|Example of wood storage shed from US cedar shed builder.]]\n\nWooden sheds have a natural look that can blend in well with garden environments. Despite the strength of wood, over time, untreated and neglected wood can rot, split, warp or become susceptible to [[mold]] and [[mildew]], so wood sheds should be treated for protection with stain and varnish. Wood sheds need regular maintenance. This includes keeping plant matter and debris from piling up beside the walls and on the roof, and occasional rot-proofing with preservative. Sheds are sometimes also re-stained or varnished at times for aesthetic and wood protection reasons. Fire and, in some regions, [[termite]] attack are also potential problems.\n\nStains and preservatives can be applied to wood sheds to prevent damage to the wood caused by exposure to rain, damp ground, [[Ultraviolet|UV light]], harsh climatic conditions, [[Fungus|fungal]] attack and wood-boring insects. If a coloured preservative oil or stain is used, a wooden shed can either be made to stand out as a feature within a garden, or to blend in with its surroundings. Red cedar coloured stain is popular. Legislation such as the European Biocidal Products Regulation has reduced the number of effective active ingredients available for wood preservative formulations. For this reason, in recent years, there has been a greater emphasis on preserving wood by keeping it dry, for example through the application of water-repellent \"wood protection creams.\"\n\nSome types of wood, such as [[Cedrus|cedar]], are more naturally resistant to water damage.\n\nWhen looking for a wooden shed, it is important to understand the difference between the two types of preservative used in their manufacture. The timber will have been treated in one of two ways: dip treatment or pressure treatment. Dip-treated sheds are made from components that are lowered into a tank of preservative before the panels are assembled. This is a quick and simple process which keeps costs down and encourages manufacturers to produce a wide variety, making dip-treated sheds the most popular and affordable type on the market. They are easily recognisable by their golden brown colour, which is due to a dye added to the preservative. Most manufacturers offer a 10-year anti-rot guarantee on dip-treated sheds, but they have to be re-coated every year or two. [http://www.wonkeedonkeeforestgarden.co.uk/forest-sheds/benefits-of-a-dip-treated-shed-or-workshop/]\n\nPressure-treated sheds are made from timber planks which have had the moisture sucked out of them under vacuum conditions in a special cylinder. A powerful preservative is then forced into the wood at high pressure until it is absorbed deep into the grain, becoming an integral part of the timber. This provides excellent protection against the weather - so much so that manufacturers generally give a 15-year anti-rot guarantee. These sheds are usually distinguished by a pale green tinge which will fade eventually to a silvery grey. Although pressure-treated sheds tend to be more expensive than dip-treated ones, their big advantage is that they won't need any further preservative treatment during the guarantee period, saving owners time and money. [http://www.wonkeedonkeeforestgarden.co.uk/forest-sheds/benefits-of-a-pressure-treated-shed-or-workshop/]\n\nOne advantage of using wood sheds over metal versions is that it is easier to modify them by adding windows, doors, shelving, or exterior trim (etc.) because wood can be cut and drilled using commonly available tools, whereas a plastic or metal shed requires specialized tools. Some homeowners may prefer wood sheds because wood is a renewable resource.\n\n====Vinyl-sided====\n[[File:10x12 Vinyl Manor.jpg|left|thumb|An Amish-style vinyl-sided shed]]\nVinyl-sided sheds are typically built with standard wood framing construction and oriented strand board (OSB) on the walls covered with standard vinyl siding. The vinyl siding protects the OSB wood and the frame from moisture from rain and snow. Vinyl-sided sheds never need to be painted, and are maintenance-free. They are stronger than plastic or metal sheds, and are usually built to conform with the local building codes. They offer good value for money because they hold up in all weather, including winters with heavy snowfall, as they use a strong wooden frame and the OSB panels have stronger structural support than thin metal or PVC siding or roofs.  Metal, plastic and resin sheds are cheaper, but they cannot handle the weight of snow in winter (roofs may cave in). Vinyl sheds also offer more colour options.\n\n====Asbestos====\nIn the early and middle years of the 20th century, many garden sheds and domestic garages were made of [[asbestos]]-cement sheets supported on a very light angle-iron frame.  Concerns about safety led to the practice being discontinued, but they were cheap and long-lasting, and many can still be seen in British gardens.

The first attested usage of the word, in 1481, was in the sentence, {{lang|ang|\"A yearde in whiche was a shadde where in were six grete dogges\"}}. The Anglo Saxon word ''\"shud\"'', which means \"cover\" may also have been part of the development of the word. In 1440, a \"shud\" was defined as a {{lang|ang|\"... schudde, hovel, swyne kote or howse of sympyl hyllynge [covering] to kepe yn beestys\"}}.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Air-raid shelter|Anderson shelter]]\n* [[Lean-to]]\n* [[Nissen hut]]\n* [[Sala (architecture)|Sala]]\n* [[Shanty town]]\n* [[Tuff Shed]]\n* [[Wendy house]]\n*[https://www.treasurebox.co.nz/outdoor-garden/garden-sheds.html garden Shed nz ]\n\n== References ==\n{{commons category|Sheds}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* {{EB1911|wstitle=Shed|volume=24|page=817}}\n* Gordon Thorburn, ''Men and Sheds'', {{ISBN|1-84330-329-9}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Commons cat inline|Sheds}}\n\n[[Category:Agricultural buildings]]\n[[Category:Garden features]]\n[[Category:Gardening aids]]\n[[Category:Building types]]\n", "text_old": "{{other uses}}\n[[File:A Shed by the Water.jpg|right|thumb|A waterside shed in Sweden]]\n[[File:Schuppen 7235.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.90|A rural shed]]\n[[File:Bike shed 15d06.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.90|Modern secure bike sheds]]\n[[File:Shed.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.90|A garden shed with a [[gambrel]] roof]]\n\nA '''shed''' is typically a simple, single-story roofed structure in a [[back garden]] or on an [[allotment (gardening)|allotment]] that is used for storage, [[hobby|hobbies]], or as a [[workshop]]. Sheds vary considerably in their size and complexity of construction, from simple open-sided ones designed to cover bicycles or garden items to large wood-framed structures with shingled roofs, windows, and [[AC power plugs and sockets|electrical outlets]]. Sheds used on [[farm]]s or in industry can be large structures. The main types of shed construction are metal sheathing over a metal frame, plastic sheathing and frame, all-wood construction (the roof may be asphalt shingled or sheathed in tin), and vinyl-sided sheds built over a wooden frame. Small sheds may include a wooden or plastic floor, while more permanent ones may be built on a concrete pad or foundation. Sheds may be [[Lock and key|lockable]] to deter theft or entry by children, domestic animals, wildlife, etc.\n\nA culture of shed enthusiasts exists in several countries for people who enjoy building sheds and spending time in them for relaxation. In [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] there are magazines called ''The Shed'', an association for shed hobbyists (the [[Australian Men's Shed Association]]), and a book entitled ''Men and Sheds''.\n\n==Terminology==\nDepending on the region and type of use, a shed may also be called a [[shack]], [[Outhouse (disambiguation)|outhouse]], or \"outbuilding\". Sheds may be classified as \"accessory buildings\" in [[By-law#Municipal by-laws|municipal bylaws]] which may regulate their size, appearance, and distance from the principal building and boundary lines.\n\n== Uses ==\n[[File:Station Oudegem - Foto 3 (2009).png|thumb|A bicycle shed]]\n{{redirect2|Bicycle shed|Bike shed|\"the bicycle shed effect\"|Law of triviality}}\n{{redirect|Garden shed|the song|Garden Shed (song)}}\n{{redirect|Toolshed|the Tool demo album|72826}}\n\n* '''Agricultural sheds''' [[File:Hay shed.jpg|right|thumb|A hay shed typical of Australia and New Zealand (elsewhere often termed a \"[[barn]]\")]]\n**Arena sheds may have a simple open roof structure, or be partially walled or fully enclosed.

These kits are designed for regular people to be able to assemble themselves using commonly available tools (e.g., screwdriver). Both shed kits and [[DIY]] (do-it-yourself) plans are available for wooden and plastic sheds. Sheds are used to store home and garden [[tool]]s and equipment such as lawn tractors, and gardening supplies. In addition, sheds can be used to store items that are not suitable for indoor storage, such as petrol ([[gasoline]]), pesticides, or [[herbicide]]s. For homes with small gardens or modest storage needs, there are several types of very small sheds. The sheds not only use less ground area but also have a low profile less likely to obstruct the view or clash with the landscaping.\n\nThese small sheds include corner sheds, which fit into a corner (3&nbsp;ft tall&nbsp;\u00d7 3 wide&nbsp;\u00d7 2 deep, or about 1&nbsp;m tall&nbsp;\u00d7 1&nbsp;m wide&nbsp;\u00d7 50&nbsp;cm deep), vertical sheds ({{convert|5|x|3|x|4|ft|m|disp=x| deep, or |abbr=on|round=0.5}}), horizontal sheds ({{convert|3|x|5|x|4|ft|m|disp=or|abbr=on|round=0.5}}), and tool sheds. When a shed is used for tool storage, [[shelf (storage)|shelves]] and [[hook (wall)|hooks]] are often used to maximize the storage space.  [[Gambrel]]-style roofed sheds (sometimes called baby barns), which resemble a Dutch-style [[barn]], have a high sloping roofline which increases storage space in the \"loft\" area. Some Gambrel-styles have no loft and offer the advantage of reduced overall height.  Another style of small shed is the [[saltbox]]-style shed. \n\nMany sheds have either a pent or apex roof shape. A pent shed features a single roof section which is angled downwards to let rainwater run off, with more headroom at the front than the back. This is a simple, practical design that will fit particularly well next to a wall or fence. It is also usually lower than the typical apex shed, so could be a better choice if there are any height restrictions. A pent shed may be free-standing or attached to a wall (when it is known, unsurprisingly, as a wall shed).  \n\nAn apex shed has a pointed roof in an inverted V shape similar to the roof line of many houses. Two roof sections meet at a ridge in the middle, providing more headroom in the centre than at the sides. This type is generally regarded as a more attractive and traditional design, and may be preferable if the shed is going to be visible from the house. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.love2learnallotmenting.co.uk/wooden-shed-buying-guide|title=Wooden Shed Buying Guide - Love2Learn Allotmenting|website=Love2Learn Allotmenting|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-05-18|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701041626/http://www.love2learnallotmenting.co.uk/wooden-shed-buying-guide|archivedate=2016-07-01}}</ref> \n\nA twist on the standard apex shape is the reverse apex shed. In this design, the door is set in a side wall instead of the front. The main advantage of the reverse apex design is that the door opens into the widest part of the shed instead of the narrowest, so it's easier to reach into all areas to retrieve or store equipment.  <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wonkeedonkeeforestgarden.co.uk/forest-sheds/sheds-explained/|title=Sheds explained|website=www.wonkeedonkeeforestgarden.co.uk|access-date=2016-05-18|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160523075739/http://www.wonkeedonkeeforestgarden.co.uk/forest-sheds/sheds-explained/|archivedate=2016-05-23}}</ref>\n\n=== Larger domestic  ===\n[[File:TallShed.JPG|left|thumb|upright=0.90|A tall shed with windows and a shingled roof]]\nLarger, more-expensive sheds are typically constructed of [[wood]] and include features typically found in house construction, such as windows, a shingled roof, and electrical outlets. Larger sheds provide more space for engaging in hobbies such as [[gardening]], small [[internal combustion engine|engine]] repair, or [[tinkering]]. <!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed:  [[File:Typical shed.jpg|right|220px|thumb|A typical large domestic workshop shed]] -->Some sheds have small porches or include furniture, which allows them to be used for relaxation purposes. In some cases, [[Telecommuting|teleworkers]] and homeworkers in general who live in mild climates use small to medium-sized wooden garden sheds as outdoor offices. There is a growing industry in providing \"off the peg\" garden offices to cater for this demand, particularly in the UK but also in the US.\n \nShed owners can customize wooden sheds to match the features (e.g., siding, trim, etc.) of the main house. A number of decorative options can be added to sheds, such as [[dormer]]s, shutters, flowerboxes, finials, and [[weathervane]]s. As well, practical options can be added such as benches, ramps, ventilation systems (e.g., in cases where a swimming pool heater is installed in a shed), and electric lighting. Sheds designed for gardening, called \"potting sheds\", often feature windows or skylights for illumination, ventilation grilles, and a potter's bench for mixing soil and re-potting plants.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Materials===\nThe main types of shed construction are metal sheathing over a metal frame, plastic sheathing and frame, all-wood construction (wood frame, wood siding and wood roof), and vinyl-sided sheds built over a wooden frame. Each type has various advantages and disadvantages that a homeowner has to consider. For example, while metal sheds are fire and termite-resistant, they can rust over time, or be severely damaged by high winds or heavy snow loads. Wood sheds are easier to modify or customize than plastic or metal, because carpentry tools and basic carpentry skills are more readily available. Vinyl-sided, wood-framed sheds blend the strength of a wood frame with the maintenance-free aspect of vinyl siding (it does not need to be painted or varnished). The [[International Building Code]] (IBC) defines a shed as a building or structure of an accessory character; it classifies them under utility and miscellaneous group U (Chapter 3 Section 312).\n\n====Metal====\n[[File:Corrugated iron shed.jpg|thumb|right|A corrugated iron shed]]\nMetal sheds made from thin sheet metal sheathing ([[galvanized steel]], [[aluminium]], or corrugated iron) attached to a metal frame. Metal sheds are a good choice when long-term strength and resistance to fire, rot, or termites is desired. However, metal sheds may [[rust]] over time, particularly if they are constructed from steel that is not galvanized. Be aware that concrete is highly corrosive so care needs to be taken when assembling your shed to avoid contact with the outside panels.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalsheds.com.au/tips-on-erecting-a-shed/ |title=Tips on Kit Shed Assembly |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131194751/http://www.nationalsheds.com.au/tips-on-erecting-a-shed/ |archivedate=2011-01-31 }}</ref>\n\nAs well, some types of metal sheds that have thin walls are easily dented, which may makes some types of thin metal sheds a poor choice for vandal-prone areas or for high-traffic activities such as small businesses. In cold climates, metal sheds with thin walls need to have snow and ice cleared from the roof, because the thin metal may be damaged by a heavy accumulation. Since thin metal sheds weigh much less than wood or PVC plastic sheds, thin metal sheds are more at risk of being damaged by heavy winds. To prevent wind damage, thin metal sheds should be attached to a concrete foundation with screws.<ref>[http://www.hardware2u.com.au/absco-garden-sheds-for-sale-and-assemble-instructional-videos How to assemble a garden shed] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090803134029/http://www.hardware2u.com.au/absco-garden-sheds-for-sale-and-assemble-instructional-videos/ |date=2009-08-03 }}</ref> In countries where the climate is generally mild, such as Australia, very large metal sheds are used for many types of industry. Corrugated metal sheds may be better able to withstand wind and snow loads, as the corrugated shape makes the metal stronger than flat tin.\n\n====Plastic====\n[[File:Lifetimesheds.JPG|thumb|left|[[Lifetime Products|Lifetime]] brand blow-molded plastic sheds]]\n[[Plastic]] shed kits utilizing heavy molded plastics such as [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] and [[polyethylene]] may be less expensive than sheet-metal sheds. PVC resins and high-impact, [[Ultraviolet|UV light]]-resistant [[polyethylene]] make plastic outdoor sheds stronger, lighter, more durable, and more resistant to denting and chipping than wood, and tend to be more stable. Plastic shed kits sided with vinyl are typically among the least-expensive types of shed construction. Higher-quality sheds use UV-resistant plastic and [[powder coating|powder-coated]] metal frames. Many plastic sheds are modular to allow for easy extensions, peg-boards, shelving, attic-storage, windows, skylights, and other accessories to be added later, if these additions are purchased from the manufacturer.\n\nPlastic sheds are not susceptible to [[termite]] or wood-boring insect damage, and they require little maintenance. Being rot-proof they do not need to have preservative applied. This makes them preferable in climates where the weather can be changeable, such as the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@ethangardener/the-best-plastic-garden-storage-boxes-sheds-and-cupboards-8b8638635a83|title=The Best Plastic Garden Storage Boxes, Sheds and Cupboards|first=Ethan|last=Knight|date=28 October 2016|website=medium.com|accessdate=4 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220124414/https://medium.com/@ethangardener/the-best-plastic-garden-storage-boxes-sheds-and-cupboards-8b8638635a83|archivedate=20 December 2016}}</ref> Unlike wooden or metal sheds, which often require a permit to build, in many areas, plastic sheds do not.

Despite the strength of wood, over time, untreated and neglected wood can rot, split, warp or become susceptible to [[mold]] and [[mildew]], so wood sheds should be treated for protection with stain and varnish. Wood sheds need regular maintenance. This includes keeping plant matter and debris from piling up beside the walls and on the roof, and occasional rot-proofing with preservative. Sheds are sometimes also re-stained or varnished at times for aesthetic and wood protection reasons. Fire and, in some regions, [[termite]] attack are also potential problems.\n\nStains and preservatives can be applied to wood sheds to prevent damage to the wood caused by exposure to rain, damp ground, [[Ultraviolet|UV light]], harsh climatic conditions, [[Fungus|fungal]] attack and wood-boring insects. If a coloured preservative oil or stain is used, a wooden shed can either be made to stand out as a feature within a garden, or to blend in with its surroundings. Red cedar coloured stain is popular. Legislation such as the European Biocidal Products Regulation has reduced the number of effective active ingredients available for wood preservative formulations. For this reason, in recent years, there has been a greater emphasis on preserving wood by keeping it dry, for example through the application of water-repellent \"wood protection creams.\"\n\nSome types of wood, such as [[Cedrus|cedar]], are more naturally resistant to water damage.\n\nWhen looking for a wooden shed, it is important to understand the difference between the two types of preservative used in their manufacture. The timber will have been treated in one of two ways: dip treatment or pressure treatment. Dip-treated sheds are made from components that are lowered into a tank of preservative before the panels are assembled. This is a quick and simple process which keeps costs down and encourages manufacturers to produce a wide variety, making dip-treated sheds the most popular and affordable type on the market. They are easily recognisable by their golden brown colour, which is due to a dye added to the preservative. Most manufacturers offer a 10-year anti-rot guarantee on dip-treated sheds, but they have to be re-coated every year or two. [http://www.wonkeedonkeeforestgarden.co.uk/forest-sheds/benefits-of-a-dip-treated-shed-or-workshop/]\n\nPressure-treated sheds are made from timber planks which have had the moisture sucked out of them under vacuum conditions in a special cylinder. A powerful preservative is then forced into the wood at high pressure until it is absorbed deep into the grain, becoming an integral part of the timber. This provides excellent protection against the weather - so much so that manufacturers generally give a 15-year anti-rot guarantee. These sheds are usually distinguished by a pale green tinge which will fade eventually to a silvery grey. Although pressure-treated sheds tend to be more expensive than dip-treated ones, their big advantage is that they won't need any further preservative treatment during the guarantee period, saving owners time and money. [http://www.wonkeedonkeeforestgarden.co.uk/forest-sheds/benefits-of-a-pressure-treated-shed-or-workshop/]\n\nOne advantage of using wood sheds over metal versions is that it is easier to modify them by adding windows, doors, shelving, or exterior trim (etc.) because wood can be cut and drilled using commonly available tools, whereas a plastic or metal shed requires specialized tools. Some homeowners may prefer wood sheds because wood is a renewable resource.\n\n====Vinyl-sided====\n[[File:10x12 Vinyl Manor.jpg|left|thumb|An Amish-style vinyl-sided shed]]\nVinyl-sided sheds are typically built with standard wood framing construction and oriented strand board (OSB) on the walls covered with standard vinyl siding. The vinyl siding protects the OSB wood and the frame from moisture from rain and snow. Vinyl-sided sheds never need to be painted, and are maintenance-free. They are stronger than plastic or metal sheds, and are usually built to conform with the local building codes. They offer good value for money because they hold up in all weather, including winters with heavy snowfall, as they use a strong wooden frame and the OSB panels have stronger structural support than thin metal or PVC siding or roofs.  Metal, plastic and resin sheds are cheaper, but they cannot handle the weight of snow in winter (roofs may cave in). Vinyl sheds also offer more colour options.\n\n====Asbestos====\nIn the early and middle years of the 20th century, many garden sheds and domestic garages were made of [[asbestos]]-cement sheets supported on a very light angle-iron frame.  Concerns about safety led to the practice being discontinued, but they were cheap and long-lasting, and many can still be seen in British gardens.  Advice on continued use or disposal is available.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aic.org.uk/FAQAC.html|title=Asbestos Cement FAQs - Asbestos Garage Roof Q&A - AIC|website=www.aic.org.uk|accessdate=4 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150425050354/http://www.aic.org.uk/FAQAC.html|archivedate=25 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n====TPR====\nSince 2013 garden sheds have been available in the UK made from TPR - a sustainable alternative to concrete.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.affresol.com/non-timber-framed-low-cost-housing.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-21 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715044234/http://affresol.com/non-timber-framed-low-cost-housing.asp |archivedate=2014-07-15 }}</ref> They are typically coated in a marine gelcoat and are far stronger and more durable than traditional sheds.

The word shade comes from the Old English word \"sceadu\", which means \"shade, shadow, darkness\". The term's P.Gmc. cognate, \"skadwo\" also means \"shady place, protection from glare or heat\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=shade&searchmode=none|title=shade - Search Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com|accessdate=4 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170723213138/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=shade&searchmode=none|archivedate=23 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Old English word is spelled in different ways, such as \"{{lang|ang|italic=no|shadde}}\", \"shad\" or \"shedde\", all of which come from an \"Old Teutonic/Anglo-Saxon root word for separation or division\".  The first attested usage of the word, in 1481, was in the sentence, {{lang|ang|\"A yearde in whiche was a shadde where in were six grete dogges\"}}. The Anglo Saxon word ''\"shud\"'', which means \"cover\" may also have been part of the development of the word. In 1440, a \"shud\" was defined as a {{lang|ang|\"... schudde, hovel, swyne kote or howse of sympyl hyllynge [covering] to kepe yn beestys\"}}.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Air-raid shelter|Anderson shelter]]\n* [[Lean-to]]\n* [[Nissen hut]]\n* [[Sala (architecture)|Sala]]\n* [[Shanty town]]\n* [[Tuff Shed]]\n* [[Wendy house]]\n*[https://www.sheddisposal.co.uk Shed Disposal U.K]\n\n== References ==\n{{commons category|Sheds}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* {{EB1911|wstitle=Shed|volume=24|page=817}}\n* Gordon Thorburn, ''Men and Sheds'', {{ISBN|1-84330-329-9}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Commons cat inline|Sheds}}\n\n[[Category:Agricultural buildings]]\n[[Category:Garden features]]\n[[Category:Gardening aids]]\n[[Category:Building types]]\n", "name_user": "Abdulmughal11233", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSee also", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shed"}
