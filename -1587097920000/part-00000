Voting in favor of the new rule were Prosser, Gableman, Roggensack, and Ziegler. Voting against were Abrahamson, Crooks, and A. Bradley. In the opinion of Justice Roggensack, \"when a judge is disqualified from participation, the votes of all who voted to elect that judge are cancelled for all issues presented by that case. Accordingly, recusal rules . . . must be narrowly tailored to meet a compelling state interest.\" In dissenting, Justice A. Bradley called the decision \"a dramatic change to our judicial code of ethics\" and took issue with the majority's decision to adopt a rule \"proposed by special interest groups.\"<ref name=\"lwv\">[http://www.wisciviljusticecouncil.org/key-issues/legislative-report-special-legislative-committee-studies-judicial-discipline-and-recusal wisciviljusticecouncil.org]; accessed January 28, 2014.</ref>\n\n===Confrontation ===\nOn June 13, 2011, a confrontation between Justices [[David Prosser, Jr.]] and [[Ann Walsh Bradley]] occurred in Bradley's chambers.

Opponents of the referendum called it an attempt to remove longtime Chief Justice [[Shirley Abrahamson]], a member of the court's liberal minority, while supporters called it an effort to promote democracy on the court.\n\n===Current justices===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Position\n!Name\n!Years on court\n!Assumed office\n!Age\n!Law School\n!Term Ends\n!Appointed or Elected\n!Succeeded\n|-\n!Chief Justice\n|{{sortname|Patience D.|Roggensack}}\n|{{Age|2003|8|1}}\n|{{dts|August 1, 2003}}\n|{{Age|1940|7|7}}\n|[[University of Wisconsin Law School|Wisconsin]]\n|{{dts|July 31, 2023}}\n|Elected\n|[[William A.

A.T. Massey Coal Co.]]'', holding 5-4 that a campaign expenditure of over $3 million by a corporate litigant to influence the election of a judge to the court that would hear its case, although legal, was an \"extreme fact\" that created a \"probability of bias\", thus requiring the judge to be [[recusal|recused]] from hearing the case.<ref>[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/08pdf/08-22.pdf ''Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co.'', 556 U.S. 868 (2009).]</ref> Wisconsin had adopted a limit of $1,000 for campaign contributions to judges, but it was unclear when mandatory recusal was required.<ref name=\"lwv\" />  The [[League of Women Voters]] petitioned the Court to require a judge to recuse himself or herself from a proceeding if the judge had received any campaign contributions from a party or entity involved in it.<ref name=\"lwv\" />  Instead, during its 2009-2010 term and by a 4-3 vote, the Court adopted a rule that recusal is not required based solely on any endorsement or receipt of a lawful campaign contribution from a party or entity involved in the proceeding, and that a judge does not need to seek recusal where it would be based solely on a party in the case sponsoring an independent expenditure or issue advocacy communication in favor of the judge. Voting in favor of the new rule were Prosser, Gableman, Roggensack, and Ziegler. Voting against were Abrahamson, Crooks, and A. Bradley. In the opinion of Justice Roggensack, \"when a judge is disqualified from participation, the votes of all who voted to elect that judge are cancelled for all issues presented by that case. Accordingly, recusal rules . . . must be narrowly tailored to meet a compelling state interest.\" In dissenting, Justice A. Bradley called the decision \"a dramatic change to our judicial code of ethics\" and took issue with the majority's decision to adopt a rule \"proposed by special interest groups.\"<ref name=\"lwv\">[http://www.wisciviljusticecouncil.org/key-issues/legislative-report-special-legislative-committee-studies-judicial-discipline-and-recusal wisciviljusticecouncil.org]; accessed January 28, 2014.</ref>\n\n===Confrontation ===\nOn June 13, 2011, a confrontation between Justices [[David Prosser, Jr.]] and [[Ann Walsh Bradley]] occurred in Bradley's chambers.

She was the world's first purpose-built [[airborne aircraft carrier|flying aircraft carrier]], carrying [[Curtiss F9C Sparrowhawk|F9C Sparrowhawk]] [[fighter plane]]s which could be launched and recovered while she was in flight. With an overall length of {{convert|785|ft|m|abbr=on}}, ''Akron'' and her [[sister ship]] {{USS|Macon|ZRS-5|2}} were among the largest flying objects ever built. Although  [[LZ 129 Hindenburg|LZ 129 ''Hindenburg'']] and LZ 130 ''[[Graf Zeppelin II]]'' were some {{convert|18|ft|m|abbr=on}} longer and slightly more voluminous, the two German airships were filled with [[hydrogen]], so the US Navy craft still hold the world record for helium-filled airships.<ref name=\"Smith (1965)\">{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Richard K|title=The Airships Akron & Macon: Flying Aircraft Carriers of the United States Navy|date=1965|publisher=United States Naval Institute|location=Annapolis, Maryland|isbn=0-87021-065-3|page=210}}</ref>\n\n''Akron'' was destroyed in a [[thunderstorm]] off the coast of [[New Jersey]] on the morning of 4 April 1933, killing 73 of the 76 crewmen and passengers. This accident involved the greatest loss of life in any airship crash up until that date.\n\n==Technical description==\n[[File:USS Akron under construction, nov 1930.jpg|thumb|left|''Akron'' under construction in the [[Goodyear Airdock]] at Akron, Ohio in November 1930. Note the three-dimensional, deep rings.]]\n\nThe airship's skeleton was built of the new lightweight [[alloy]] [[duralumin]] 17-SRT.<ref>Smith (1965). p 181</ref> The frame introduced several novel features compared with traditional Zeppelin designs. Rather than being single-girder diamond trusses with radial wire bracing, the main rings of ''Akron'' were self-supporting deep frames: triangular Warren trusses 'curled' round to form a ring. Though much heavier than conventional rings, the deep rings promised to be much stronger, a significant attraction to the navy after the in-flight break up of the earlier conventional airships [[R38]]/[[ZR-2]] and [[ZR-1]] ''Shenandoah''.<ref>Smith (1965). p 187</ref> The inherent strength of these frames allowed the chief designer, [[Karl Arnstein]], to dispense with the internal cruciform structure used by Zeppelin to support the fins of their ships. Instead, the fins of ''Akron'' were cantilevered: mounted entirely externally to the main structure.<ref>Smith (1965). pp 161 & 189</ref> Zeppelin and other rigid designs used a single keel at the lowest point of the hull circumference but Arnstein gave ''Akron'' three keels, one running along the top of the hull and one each side, 45 degrees up from the lower centreline. Each keel provided a walkway running almost the entire length of the ship. The strength of the main rings, the lower keels, and the fact that helium, instead of flammable hydrogen, was to be used, also allowed the designer to mount the engines inside the hull, improving streamlining.\n\nThe main rings were spaced at {{convert|22.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} and between each pair were three intermediate rings of lighter construction. In keeping with conventional practice, 'station numbers' on the airship were measured in meters from zero at the rudder post, positive forward and negative aft. Thus the tip of the tail was at station \u221223.75 and the nose mooring spindle was at station 210.75. Each ring frame formed a polygon with 36 corners and these (and their associated longitudinal girders) were numbered from 1 (at the bottom centre) to 18 (at the top centre) port and starboard.<ref>Smith (1965). p 191</ref> Thus a position on the hull could be referred to, for example, as \"6 port at station 102.5\" (the number 1 engine room).\n\nWhile Germany, France and Britain used [[goldbeater's skin]] to gas-proof their gasbags, ''Akron'' used Goodyear Tire and Rubber's rubberised cotton, heavier but much cheaper and more durable. Half the gas cells used an experimental cotton-based fabric impregnated with a gelatin-latex compound. This was more expensive than the rubberised cotton but lighter than goldbeater's skin. It was so successful that all the gasbags of ''Macon'' were made from it.<ref>Smith (1965). p 196</ref> There were 12 gas cells, numbered 0 to XI, using Roman numerals and starting from the tail.<ref>Smith (1965). pp 182 & 191</ref> While the 'air volume' of the hull was {{convert|7,401,260|cufoot|m3|abbr=on}}, the total volume of the gas cells at 100 percent fill was {{convert|6,850,000|cufoot|m3|abbr=on}}. At a normal 95 percent fill with helium of standard purity, the {{convert|6,500,000|cufoot|m3|abbr=on}} of gas would yield a gross lift of {{convert|403,000|lb|kg|abbr=on}}. Given a structure deadweight of {{convert|242,356|lb|kg|abbr=on}},<ref>Smith (1965). pp 181 & 183</ref> this gives a useful lift of {{convert|160,644|lb|kg|abbr=on}} available for fuel, lubricants, ballast, crew, supplies and military load (including the skyhook airplanes)\n\nEight [[Maybach VL II]] {{convert|560|hp|kW|abbr=on}} gasoline engines were mounted inside the hull.<ref>Hook 1976. p. 47</ref> Each engine turned a two-bladed, {{convert|16|ft|4|in|m|abbr=on}} diameter, fixed pitch, wooden propeller via a driveshaft and bevel gearing which allowed the propeller to swivel from the vertical plane to the horizontal.<ref>Summit Memory. [http://www.summitmemory.org/u?/photos,216 U.S.S. Akron \u2013 Propeller]. Retrieved 2008-07-22</ref> With the engines' ability to reverse, this allowed thrust to be applied forward, aft, up or down.<ref name=\"Smith 193\">Smith (1965). p 193</ref> It appears from photographs that the four propellers on each side were contra-rotating, each one turning the opposite way to the one ahead of it. Thus it would appear that the designers were aware that running the propellers in the air disturbed by the one ahead was not ideal. While the external engine pods of other airships allowed the thrust lines to be staggered, placing all four engine rooms on each side of the ship along the lower keel resulted in ''Akron''{{'}}s propellers all being in line. This was to prove problematical in service, inducing considerable vibration, especially noticeable in the emergency control position in the lower fin. By 1933, ''Akron'' had two of her propellers replaced by more advanced, ground-adjustable, three-bladed, metal propellers.<ref>Smith (1965). p 75</ref> These promised a performance increase and were adopted as standard for ''Macon''.\n\nThe outer cover was of cotton cloth, treated with four coats of clear and two coats of aluminum pigmented cellulose dope. The total area of the skin was {{convert|330,000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} and it weighed, after doping, {{convert|113,000|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Smith 182\">Smith (1965). p 182</ref>\n\nThe prominent dark vertical bands on the hull were condensers of the system designed to recover water from the engines' exhaust for [[Buoyancy compensator (aviation)|buoyancy compensation]]. In-flight fuel consumption continuously reduces an airship's weight and changes in the temperature of the lifting gas can do the same. Normally, expensive helium has to be valved off to compensate and any way of avoiding this is desirable. In theory, a water recovery system such as this can produce 1&nbsp;lb of ballast water for every lb of fuel burned, though this is unlikely to be achieved in practice.<ref name=\"Smith 193\"/>\n\n''Akron'' could carry up to {{convert|20700|USgal|L|abbr=on}} of gasoline ({{convert|126,000|lb|kg|abbr=on}}) in 110 separate tanks which were distributed along the lower keels to preserve the ship's trim, giving her a normal range of {{convert|5940|nmi|mi km|lk=on|abbr=on}} at cruising speed.<ref>Smith (1965). pp 180\u2013183</ref> Theoretical maximum ballast water capacity was {{convert|223,000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} in 44 bags, again distributed along her length, though normal ballast load at unmasting was {{convert|20,000|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Smith 182\"/>\n\nThe heart of the ship, and her sole reason for existing, was the airplane hangar and trapeze system. Aft of the control car, in bay VII, between frames 125 and 141.25, was a compartment large enough to accommodate up to five [[Curtiss F9C Sparrowhawk|F9C Sparrowhawk]] airplanes. However, two structural girders partially obstructed ''Akron''{{'}}s aftmost hangar bays, limiting its capacity to three airplanes (one in each forward corner of the hangar and one on the trapeze). A modification to remove this design flaw was pending at the time of the ship's loss.<ref name=\"Smith 1965. p 67\">Smith (1965). p 67</ref>\n\nThe F9C was not the ideal choice, being designed as a 'conventional' carrier-borne fighter. It was heavily built to withstand carrier landings, downward visibility was not very good and it initially lacked an effective radio. But the primary role of ''Akron''{{'}}s airplanes was long-range naval scouting. What was actually needed was a stable, fast, lightweight scouting airplane with a long range,<ref>Smith (1965). pp 27 & 201</ref> but none existed capable of fitting between the structural members and into the airship's hangar, as the F9C could.\n\nThe trapeze was lowered through the T-shaped door in the bottom of the ship and into the slipstream, with an airplane attached to the crossbar by the 'skyhook' above its top wing, its pilot on board and its engine running. The pilot tripped the hook and the airplane fell away from the ship. On his return, he positioned himself beneath the trapeze and climbed up until he could fly his skyhook onto the crossbar, at which point it automatically latched shut. Now, with the engine idling, the trapeze and airplane were raised into the hangar, the pilot cutting his engine as he passed through the door. Once inside, the airplane was transferred from the trapeze to a trolley, running on an overhead 'monorail' system by which it could be shunted into one of the four corners of the hangar to be refueled and re-armed. Having a single trapeze raised two problems: it limited the rate at which airplanes could be launched and recovered and any fault in the trapeze would leave any airborne scouts with nowhere to land. The solution was a second, fixed trapeze permanently rigged further aft along the bottom of the ship at station 102.5 and known as the 'perch'. By 1933 a perch was fitted and in use. Three more perches were planned (at stations 57.5, 80 and 147.5) but these were never fitted.<ref name=\"Smith 1965. p 67\"/>\n\n''Akron'' revived an idea used, and eventually rejected, by the German Navy [[zeppelin]]s during [[World War I]]: the ''[[Spy basket|sp\u00e4hkorb]]'' or 'spy basket'.<ref name=\"Smith 1965. p 55\">Smith (1965). p 55</ref> Intended to allow the airship to remain hidden in a cloud layer while still observing the enemy below, a small car, rather like an airplane fuselage without wings, could be lowered on a cable. The observer on board communicated with the ship by telephone. In theory, the spy basket could also be used for determining whether the air below a cloud layer was clear enough to allow a landing or if the murk reached all the way to the surface.\n\nDuring the design stage, in 1929, the navy requested an alteration to the fins. It was considered desirable for the bottom of the lower fin to be visible from the control car. [[Charles E. Rosendahl]] had witnessed, from the control room, ''[[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin|Graf Zeppelin]]'' almost snagging her fin on high-tension power lines during her heavy take off into an unsuspected but very marked temperature inversion from [[Mines Field]], Los Angeles at the start of the last leg of her round-the-world flight earlier that year.<ref>Rosendahl (1932). pp 194 et al</ref> The design change would also allow direct vision between the main control car and the emergency control position in the lower fin. The control car was moved {{convert|8|ft|m|abbr=on}} aft and all the fins were shortened and deepened. The leading edge root of the fins no longer coincided with a main (deep) ring and instead the foremost attachment was now to an intermediate ring at frame 28.75. This achieved the required visibility, improved low-speed controllability, due to the increased span of the control surfaces, and simplified stress calculations, by reducing the number of fin attachment points. The designers and the navy's inspectors, led by the very experienced Charles P Burgess, were entirely satisfied with the revised stress calculations. However, this alteration has been the subject of much criticism as an \"inherent defect\" in the design and is often alleged to have been a major factor in the loss of ''Akron''{{'}}s sister ship ''Macon''.<ref>Smith (1965). p 197</ref>\n\n==Construction and commissioning==\nConstruction of ''ZRS-4'' was begun on 31 October 1929 at the [[Goodyear Airdock]] in [[Springfield Township, Summit County, Ohio|Akron, Ohio]] by the [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear-Zeppelin Corporation]].<ref>{{cite web | publisher =via [[Akron-Summit County Public Library]] | first = | title = Goodyear-Zeppelin Corporation, Facts About the World's Largest Airship Factory & Dock | url=http://www.summitmemory.org/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/fulton&CISOPTR=97&CISOSHOW=93 | accessdate = 2008-11-15}}</ref> Because she was larger than any airship previously built in the USA, a special hangar was constructed<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=FigDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA20&dq=Popular+Science+1932+plane&hl=en&ei=k79PTYCuA4P78Abo8_3EDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CEYQ6AEwBzge#v=onepage&q&f=true \"A Nine Acre Nest For Dirigibles\"] ''Popular Science Monthly'', September 1929</ref> Chief Designer Karl Arnstein and a team of experienced German airship engineers instructed and supported design and construction of both [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] airships USS ''Akron'' and USS ''Macon''.<ref>Smith (1965). pp 7, 8, 34 & 161</ref>\n\nOn 7 November 1929, [[Rear Admiral]] [[William A. Moffett]], the Chief of the U.S. Navy's [[Bureau of Aeronautics]], drove the \"golden rivet\" in the ship's first main ring. Erection of the [[wikt:hull|hull]] sections began in March 1930. On 10 May, [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[Charles Francis Adams III|Charles Francis Adams]] chose the name ''Akron'' (for the city near where she was being built) and [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy]] [[Ernest Lee Jahncke]] announced it four days later, on 14 May 1930.\n[[File:ZRS-4 USS Akron duralumin sample.jpg|thumb|left|Sample of the [[duralumin]] from which the frame of USS ''Akron'' was built]]\n\nOn 8 August 1931, ''Akron'' was launched (floated free of the hangar floor) and  [[ship naming and launching|christened]] by First Lady [[Lou Henry Hoover]], the [[First Lady of the United States|wife]] of the President of the United States, [[Herbert Clark Hoover]]. The maiden flight of ''Akron'' took place around [[Cleveland]] on the afternoon of 23 September with Secretary of the Navy Adams and Rear Admiral Moffett on board. The airship made eight more flights\u2014principally over Lake Erie but ranging as far as [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]], [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]], and [[Columbus, Ohio]]\u2014before being flown from Akron to the [[NAS Lakehurst|Naval Air Station (NAS)]] at Lakehurst, New Jersey, where she was delivered to the Navy and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on [[Navy Day]], 27 October, with Lieutenant Commander [[Charles E. Rosendahl]] in command.\n\n==History of service==\n\n===Maiden voyage===\nOn 2 November 1931, ''Akron'' cast off for a maiden voyage as a commissioned \"ship\" of the U.S. Navy and cruised down the eastern seaboard to [[Washington, D.C.]] Over the weeks that followed, some 300 hours aloft were logged in a series of flights, including a 46-hour endurance flight to [[Mobile, Alabama]], and back. The return leg of the trip was made via the valleys of the [[Mississippi River]] and the [[Ohio River]].\n[[File:USS Akron in flight, nov 1931.jpg|thumb|right|The maiden voyage of ''Akron'' on 2 November 1931, showing her four starboard propellers. The engines' water reclaiming devices appear as white strips above each propeller. The emergency rear control cabin is visible in the lower fin.]]\n\n===Participation in a search exercise (January 1932)===\n[[File:USS Akron Chesapeake Bay February 1932.ogv|thumb|Film of ''Akron'' operating over [[Chesapeake Bay]] in early 1932, including footage of the ship mooring to the airship tender {{USS|Patoka|AO-9|6}}]]\nOn the morning of 9 January 1932, ''Akron'' departed from Lakehurst to work with the [[Scouting Fleet]] on a search exercise. Proceeding to the coast of [[North Carolina]], ''Akron'' headed out over the Atlantic where she was assigned to find a group of [[destroyer]]s bound for  [[Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba]]. Once these were located, the airship was to shadow them and report their movements. Leaving the coast of North Carolina at about 7:21 on the morning of 10 January, the airship proceeded south, but bad weather prevented sighting the destroyers (contact with them was missed at 12:40 EST, although their crews had sighted ''Akron'') and eventually shaped a course toward the [[Bahama]]s by late afternoon. Heading northwesterly into the night, ''Akron'' then changed course shortly before midnight and proceeded to the southeast. Ultimately, at 9:08 am on 11 January, the airship succeeded in spotting the [[light cruiser]] {{USS|Raleigh|CL-7|6}} and 12 destroyers, positively identifying them on the eastern horizon two minutes later. Sighting a second group of destroyers shortly thereafter, ''Akron'' was released from the evaluation about 10:00&nbsp;a.m., having achieved a \"qualified success\" in the initial test with the Scouting Fleet.\n\nAs the historian Richard K Smith wrote in his definitive study,<cite>The Airships ''Akron'' and ''Macon''</cite>, \"...consideration given to the weather, duration of flight, a track of more than {{convert|3000|mi|abbr=on}} flown, her material deficiencies, and the rudimentary character of aerial navigation at that date, the ''Akron'''s performance was remarkable. There was not a military airplane in the world in 1932 which could have given the same performance, operating from the same base.\"<ref>Smith (1965). p 51</ref>\n\n===First accident (February 1932)===\n''Akron'' was to have taken part in [[Fleet Problem XIII]], but an accident at Lakehurst on 22 February 1932 prevented her participation. While the airship was being taken from her hangar, the tail came loose from her moorings, was caught by the wind, and struck the ground.<ref>{{citation  |title=Sudden Gale Akron at Lakehurst NJ 1932/02/22 |date=1932 |url=https://archive.org/details/1932-02-22_Sudden_Gale_Akron_at_Lakehurst_NJ |publisher=[[Universal Newsreel|Universal Newspaper Newsreel]] |accessdate=20 February 2009}}</ref> The heaviest damage was confined to the lower fin area, which required repair. Also, ground handling fittings had been torn from the main frame, necessitating further repairs. ''Akron'' was not certified as airworthy again until later in the spring. Her next operation took place on 28 April, when she made a nine-hour flight with Rear Admiral Moffett and Secretary of the Navy Adams aboard.\n\nAs a result of this accident, a turntable with a walking beam on tracks powered by electric mine locomotives was developed to secure the tail and turn the ship even in high winds so that she could be pulled into the massive hangar at Lakehurst naval air station.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QSgDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA33&dq=Popular+Science+1931+plane&hl=en&ei=-AcLTa-vIOaJnAf7-9C4Dg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CDUQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&q&f=true|title=Popular Science|first=Bonnier|last=Corporation|date=1 April 1932|publisher=Bonnier Corporation|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\n===Testing of the \"spy basket\"===\nSoon after returning to Lakehurst to disembark her distinguished passengers, ''Akron'' took off again to conduct a test of the \"[[spy basket]]\"\u2014something like a small airplane fuselage suspended beneath the airship that would enable an observer to serve as the ship's \"eyes\" below the clouds while the ship herself remained out of sight above them. The first time the basket was tried (with sandbags aboard instead of a man), it oscillated so violently that it put the whole ship in danger. The basket proved \"frighteningly unstable\", swooping from one side of the airship to the other before the startled gaze of ''Akron''{{'}}s officers and men and reaching as high as the ship's equator.<ref name=\"Smith 1965. p 55\"/> Though it was later improved by adding a ventral stabilizing fin, the spybasket was never used again.<ref>Smith (1965). pp 133\u2013135</ref>\n\n===Experimental use as a \"flying aircraft carrier\"===\n[[File:F9C in USS Akron hangar1932.jpg|thumb|right|[[Curtiss F9C Sparrowhawk|F9C Sparrowhawk]] in ''Akron''{{'}}s hangar. This aircraft was one of four lost with {{USS|Macon|ZRS-5|6}} on 12 February 1935.]]\n\n''Akron'' and ''Macon'' (which was still under construction) were regarded as potential [[Airborne aircraft carrier|\"flying aircraft carrier]]s\", carrying [[parasite fighter]]s for reconnaissance. On 3 May 1932, ''Akron'' cruised over the coast of [[New Jersey]] with Rear Admiral [[George C. Day]]\u2014President of the [[Board of Inspection and Survey]]\u2014on board, and for the first time tested the \"trapeze\" installation for in-flight handling of aircraft. The [[naval aviator|aviator]]s who carried out those historic \"landings\"\u2014first with a Consolidated [[Fleet Model 1|N2Y]] [[Trainer aircraft|trainer]] and then with the prototype [[Curtiss F9C Sparrowhawk|Curtiss XF9C-1 Sparrowhawk]]\u2014were Lieutenant Daniel W. Harrigan and Lieutenant Howard L. Young. The following day, ''Akron'' carried out another demonstration flight, this time with members of the [[House Committee on Naval Affairs]] on board; this time, Lieutenants Harrigan and Howard gave the lawmakers a demonstration of ''Akron''{{'}}s ability to handle aircraft.\n\n===\"Coast-to-Coast\" flight and second accident (May 1932)===\n[[File:ZRS-4 USS Akron Cover 1932.jpg|thumb|left|Cover carried on the May 1932 \"Coast to Coast\" flight and later autographed by the only three survivors of the April 1933, crash of USS ''Akron''.]]\n\nFollowing the conclusion of those trial flights, ''Akron'' departed from Lakehurst, New Jersey on 8 May 1932, for the American west coast. The airship proceeded down the eastern seaboard to [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and then across the southern gulf states, continuing over Texas and [[Arizona]]. ''En route'' to [[Sunnyvale, California]], ''Akron'' reached [[Camp Kearny]] in San Diego, on the morning of 11 May and attempted to moor. Since neither trained ground handlers nor specialized [[mooring mast|mooring]] equipment were present, the landing at Camp Kearny was fraught with danger. By the time the crew started the evaluation, the helium gas had been warmed by sunlight, increasing lift. Lightened by {{convert|40|ST|t|abbr=on}}, the amount of fuel spent during the transcontinental trip, ''Akron'' was now all but uncontrollable.\n[[File:Akron incident 11 may32.jpg|thumb|right|Still pictures from 11 May 1932, incident: the two pictures on the left and the picture at far right are of Seaman Cowart; the picture second from right shows Henton and Edsall before their fatal fall]]\n\nThe mooring cable was cut to avert a catastrophic nose-stand by the errant airship which floated upward.

Serving as part of the \"Green Force\", the ''Akron'' attempted to locate the \"White Force\". Although opposed by [[Vought O2U Corsair]] [[floatplane]]s from \"enemy\" [[warship]]s, the airship located the opposing forces in just 22 hours, a fact not lost upon some of the participants in the exercise in subsequent critiques.\n[[File:USS Akron (ZRS-4) in flight over Manhattan, circa 1931-1933.jpg|thumb|left|''Akron'' over [[Lower Manhattan]].]]\n\nIn need of repairs, ''Akron'' departed from Sunnyvale on 11 June bound for [[Lakehurst, New Jersey]], on a return trip that was sprinkled with difficulties, mostly because of unfavorable weather, and she arrived on 15 June after a \"long and sometimes harrowing\" aerial voyage.\n\n''Akron'' next underwent a period of voyage repairs before taking part in July in a search for ''Curlew'', a yacht which had failed to reach port at the end of a race to the island of [[Bermuda]].

Admiral Moffett again boarded ''Akron'' on 20 July, but the next day left the airship in one of her N2Y-1s which took him back to Lakehurst after a severe storm had delayed the airship's own return to base.\n\n===Further tests as \"flying aircraft carrier\"===\n''Akron'' entered a new phase of her career that summer engaging in intense experimentation with the revolutionary \"trapeze\" and a full complement of F9C-2s. A key element of the entrance into that new phase was a new commanding officer, Commander Alger Dresel.\n\n===Third accident (August 1932)===\nAnother accident hampered training on 22 August when ''Akron''{{'}}s tail fin became fouled by a beam in Lakehurst's massive Hangar No 1 after a premature order to commence towing the ship out of the mooring circle. Nevertheless, rapid repairs enabled eight more flights over the Atlantic during the last three months of 1932. These operations involved intensive work with the trapeze and the F9C-2s, as well as the drilling of lookouts and gun crews.\n\nAmong the tasks undertaken were the maintenance of two aircraft patrolling and scouting on ''Akron''{{'}}s flanks. During a seven-hour period on 18 November 1932, the airship and a trio of planes searched a sector 100 mi wide.\n\n===Return to the fleet===\n[[File:Akron test pilots.jpg|thumb|right|Pilot officers of USS ''Akron'' Air Group, 1933 (l to r): Lt(JG) Robert W. Lawson, Lt Harold B. Miller, Lt [[Frederick M. Trapnell]], Lt Howard L. Young, Lt(JG) Frederick N. Kivette]]\n\nAfter local operations out of Lakehurst for the remainder of 1932, ''Akron'' was ready to resume operations with the fleet. On the afternoon of 3 January 1933, Commander [[Frank C. McCord]] relieved Commander Dresel as commanding officer, the latter becoming the first commanding officer of ''Akron''{{'}}s sister ship ''Macon'', whose construction was almost complete. Within hours, ''Akron'' headed south down the eastern seaboard toward Florida where, after refueling at the Naval Reserve Aviation Base, [[Opa-locka, Florida]], near Miami, the next day proceeded to Guant\u00e1namo Bay for an inspection of base sites. At this time the N2Y-1s were used to provide aerial \"taxi\" service to ferry members of the inspection party back and forth.\n\nSoon thereafter, ''Akron'' returned to Lakehurst for local operations which were interrupted by a two-week overhaul and poor weather. In March, she carried out intensive training with an aviation unit of F9C-2s, honing hook-on skills. During the course of these operations, an overfly of Washington DC was made 4 March 1933, the day [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Franklin D. Roosevelt]] first took the oath of office as President of the United States.\n\nOn 11 March, ''Akron'' departed Lakehurst bound for [[Panama]] stopping briefly ''en route'' at Opa-locka before proceeding on to [[Balboa, Panama|Balboa]] where an inspection party looked over a potential air base site. While returning northward, the airship paused at Opa-locka again for local operations exercising gun crews, with the N2Y-1s serving as targets, before getting underway for Lakehurst on 22 March.\n\n==Loss==\n[[File:ZRS-4 USS Akron Memorial Cover 1933.jpg|thumb|left|Franked USS ''Akron'' penalty cover with 1933 Memorial Day cachet autographed by its only three survivors, and postmarked at Lakehurst on 24 June 1933, the day ''Macon'' first arrived there.]]\n\nOn the evening of 3 April 1933, ''Akron'' cast off from the [[mooring mast]] to operate along the coast of [[New England]], assisting in the calibration of [[radio direction finder]] stations. Rear Admiral Moffett was again on board along with his aide, Commander Henry Barton Cecil, Commander Fred T. Berry, the commanding officer of NAS Lakehurst, and Lieutenant Colonel Alfred F. Masury, [[U.S. Army Reserve]], a guest of the admiral, the vice-president of [[Mack Trucks]], and a strong proponent of the potential civilian uses of rigid airships.\n\n''Akron'' soon encountered severe weather, which did not improve when the airship passed over [[Barnegat Light, New Jersey]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nj.com/ocean/index.ssf/2013/03/forgotten_us_airship_crash_recalled_80_years_later.html |title=Forgotten U.S. airship crash recalled 80 years later |publisher=NJ.com |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=13 March 2013 |accessdate=24 March 2014}}</ref> at 10:00&nbsp;pm as wind gusts of terrific force struck her massive airframe. The airship was being flown into an area of lower barometric pressure than at take-off, which caused the actual altitude flown to be lower than that indicated in the control gondola. Around 12:30&nbsp;a.m. on 4 April, ''Akron'' was caught by an updraft, followed almost immediately by a downdraft. Commander McCord, the captain, ordered full speed ahead, ballast dropped. The [[executive officer]], [[Lieutenant Commander]] [[Herbert V. Wiley]], handled the ballast and emptied the bow emergency ballast. Coupled with the elevator man holding the nose up, this caused the nose to rise and the tail to rotate down. The descent of ''Akron'' was only temporarily halted, before downdrafts forced the airship down farther. Wiley activated the 18 \"howlers\" of the ship's telephone system, a signal to landing stations. At this point, ''Akron'' was nose up, between 12 degrees and 25 degrees.\n\nThe engineering officer called out \"800 feet\" (240 m), which was followed by a \"gust\" of intense violence. The steersman reported no response to his wheel as the lower rudder cables had been torn away. While the control gondola was still hundreds of feet high, the lower fin of ''Akron'' had struck the water and was torn off.\n\n''Akron'' broke up rapidly and sank in the stormy Atlantic. The crew of the nearby German [[merchant ship]] ''Phoebus'' saw lights descending toward the ocean at about 12:23&nbsp;a.m. and altered course to starboard to investigate, with her captain believing that he was witnessing an airplane crash. At 12:55&nbsp;a.m., the unconscious Commander Wiley was pulled from the water while the ship's boat picked up three more men: Chief Radioman Robert W. Copeland, Boatswain's Mate Second Class Richard E. Deal, and Aviation Metalsmith Second Class Moody E. Erwin. Despite artificial respiration, Copeland never regained consciousness, and he died aboard ''Phoebus''.\n\nAlthough the German sailors spotted four or five other men in the water, they did not know their ship had chanced upon the crash of ''Akron'' until Lt. Commander Wiley regained consciousness half an hour after being rescued. The crew of ''Phoebus'' combed the ocean in boats for over five hours in a fruitless search for more survivors. The Navy [[blimp]] [[J-Class Blimp|''J-3'']]\u2014sent out to join the search\u2014also crashed, with the loss of two men.<ref>{{cite web |title=David E.

Smith,<ref name=\"Smith 1965. p 171\">Smith (1965). p 171</ref> ''Akron'' never got the chance to show what she was capable of. Initially, the idea had been to use her as a scout for the fleet (just as the German Navy [[zeppelin]]s had been used during [[World War I]]), with her airplanes being simply useful auxiliaries, capable of extending her range of vision or of defending her against attacking enemy aircraft.<ref>Smith (1965). p 177</ref> Gradually, in the minds of the more forward-thinking officers familiar with airship and scouting fleet operations, this was reversed: she and ''Macon'' came to be regarded as aircraft carriers, whose sole job was to get the scouting airplanes to the search area and then to support them in their flights.<ref name=\"Harrigan Report\">Report by Senior Aviator, HTA Unit to CO, Akron ZRS4/A4-3, 15 December 1932, Record Group 72, BuAer General Correspondence (1925\u20131942), Box 5592, US National Archives</ref><ref>Smith (1965). pp 51 & 107</ref> The mothership herself should stay in the background, out of sight of enemy surface units, merely acting as a mobile advanced base for the airplanes which should do all the actual searching.<ref>Smith (1965). pp 28 & 29</ref> Any aircraft carrier could do this but only an airship could do it so quickly: her speed was at least twice that of a surface ship, enabling her to get to the scene or be switched from flank to flank quickly. But this was an experimental ship, a prototype, and it took time for this doctrine and suitable tactics to evolve. It also took time to develop the techniques of navigating, controlling and coordinating the scouts. At first, developments were hampered by inadequate radio equipment,<ref>Smith (1965). pp 49 & 51</ref> as well as the difficulties encountered by the scout pilots in navigating, scouting and communicating from their cramped, open cockpits.<ref>Smith (1965). p 69</ref>\n\nSome politicians, some senior officers and some sections of the press seemed predisposed to judge the airship experiment a failure, without regard to the evidence.<ref>Smith (1965). pp. 51, 53, 55, 59 etc</ref> Even within the Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics, many opposed spending so much on a single asset.<ref name=\"Smith 1965. p 171\"/> Smith also asserts that political pressure from within the navy and elsewhere led to the ship being pushed too early to attempt too much.<ref>Smith (1965). p. 45 et al (especially p 56)</ref> Little allowance seems to have been made for the fact that this was a prototype, experimental system and that tactics for her use were being developed \"on the hoof\".

With an overall length of {{convert|785|ft|m|abbr=on}}, ''Akron'' and her [[sister ship]] {{USS|Macon|ZRS-5|2}} were among the largest flying objects ever built. Although  [[LZ 129 Hindenburg|LZ 129 ''Hindenburg'']] and LZ 130 ''[[Graf Zeppelin II]]'' were some {{convert|18|ft|m|abbr=on}} longer and slightly more voluminous, the two German airships were filled with [[hydrogen]], so the US Navy craft still hold the world record for helium-filled airships.<ref name=\"Smith (1965)\">{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Richard K|title=The Airships Akron & Macon: Flying Aircraft Carriers of the United States Navy|date=1965|publisher=United States Naval Institute|location=Annapolis, Maryland|isbn=0-87021-065-3|page=210}}</ref>\n\n''Akron'' was destroyed in a [[thunderstorm]] off the coast of [[New Jersey]] on the morning of 4 April 1933, killing 73 of the 76 crewmen and passengers. This accident involved the greatest loss of life in any airship crash up until that date.\n\n==Technical description==\n[[File:USS Akron under construction, nov 1930.jpg|thumb|left|''Akron'' under construction in the [[Goodyear Airdock]] at Akron, Ohio in November 1930. Note the three-dimensional, deep rings.]]\n\nThe airship's skeleton was built of the new lightweight [[alloy]] [[duralumin]] 17-SRT.<ref>Smith (1965). p 181</ref> The frame introduced several novel features compared with traditional Zeppelin designs. Rather than being single-girder diamond trusses with radial wire bracing, the main rings of ''Akron'' were self-supporting deep frames: triangular Warren trusses 'curled' round to form a ring. Though much heavier than conventional rings, the deep rings promised to be much stronger, a significant attraction to the navy after the in-flight break up of the earlier conventional airships [[R38]]/[[ZR-2]] and [[ZR-1]] ''Shenandoah''.<ref>Smith (1965). p 187</ref> The inherent strength of these frames allowed the chief designer, [[Karl Arnstein]], to dispense with the internal cruciform structure used by Zeppelin to support the fins of their ships. Instead, the fins of ''Akron'' were cantilevered: mounted entirely externally to the main structure.<ref>Smith (1965). pp 161 & 189</ref> Zeppelin and other rigid designs used a single keel at the lowest point of the hull circumference but Arnstein gave ''Akron'' three keels, one running along the top of the hull and one each side, 45 degrees up from the lower centreline. Each keel provided a walkway running almost the entire length of the ship. The strength of the main rings, the lower keels, and the fact that helium, instead of flammable hydrogen, was to be used, also allowed the designer to mount the engines inside the hull, improving streamlining.\n\nThe main rings were spaced at {{convert|22.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} and between each pair were three intermediate rings of lighter construction. In keeping with conventional practice, 'station numbers' on the airship were measured in meters from zero at the rudder post, positive forward and negative aft. Thus the tip of the tail was at station \u221223.75 and the nose mooring spindle was at station 210.75. Each ring frame formed a polygon with 36 corners and these (and their associated longitudinal girders) were numbered from 1 (at the bottom centre) to 18 (at the top centre) port and starboard.<ref>Smith (1965). p 191</ref> Thus a position on the hull could be referred to, for example, as \"6 port at station 102.5\" (the number 1 engine room).\n\nWhile Germany, France and Britain used [[goldbeater's skin]] to gas-proof their gasbags, ''Akron'' used Goodyear Tire and Rubber's rubberised cotton, heavier but much cheaper and more durable. Half the gas cells used an experimental cotton-based fabric impregnated with a gelatin-latex compound. This was more expensive than the rubberised cotton but lighter than goldbeater's skin. It was so successful that all the gasbags of ''Macon'' were made from it.<ref>Smith (1965). p 196</ref> There were 12 gas cells, numbered 0 to XI, using Roman numerals and starting from the tail.<ref>Smith (1965). pp 182 & 191</ref> While the 'air volume' of the hull was {{convert|7,401,260|cufoot|m3|abbr=on}}, the total volume of the gas cells at 100 percent fill was {{convert|6,850,000|cufoot|m3|abbr=on}}. At a normal 95 percent fill with helium of standard purity, the {{convert|6,500,000|cufoot|m3|abbr=on}} of gas would yield a gross lift of {{convert|403,000|lb|kg|abbr=on}}. Given a structure deadweight of {{convert|242,356|lb|kg|abbr=on}},<ref>Smith (1965). pp 181 & 183</ref> this gives a useful lift of {{convert|160,644|lb|kg|abbr=on}} available for fuel, lubricants, ballast, crew, supplies and military load (including the skyhook airplanes)\n\nEight [[Maybach VL II]] {{convert|560|hp|kW|abbr=on}} gasoline engines were mounted inside the hull.<ref>Hook 1976. p. 47</ref> Each engine turned a two-bladed, {{convert|16|ft|4|in|m|abbr=on}} diameter, fixed pitch, wooden propeller via a driveshaft and bevel gearing which allowed the propeller to swivel from the vertical plane to the horizontal.<ref>Summit Memory. [http://www.summitmemory.org/u?/photos,216 U.S.S. Akron \u2013 Propeller]. Retrieved 2008-07-22</ref> With the engines' ability to reverse, this allowed thrust to be applied forward, aft, up or down.<ref name=\"Smith 193\">Smith (1965). p 193</ref> It appears from photographs that the four propellers on each side were contra-rotating, each one turning the opposite way to the one ahead of it. Thus it would appear that the designers were aware that running the propellers in the air disturbed by the one ahead was not ideal. While the external engine pods of other airships allowed the thrust lines to be staggered, placing all four engine rooms on each side of the ship along the lower keel resulted in ''Akron''{{'}}s propellers all being in line. This was to prove problematical in service, inducing considerable vibration, especially noticeable in the emergency control position in the lower fin. By 1933, ''Akron'' had two of her propellers replaced by more advanced, ground-adjustable, three-bladed, metal propellers.<ref>Smith (1965). p 75</ref> These promised a performance increase and were adopted as standard for ''Macon''.\n\nThe outer cover was of cotton cloth, treated with four coats of clear and two coats of aluminum pigmented cellulose dope. The total area of the skin was {{convert|330,000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} and it weighed, after doping, {{convert|113,000|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Smith 182\">Smith (1965). p 182</ref>\n\nThe prominent dark vertical bands on the hull were condensers of the system designed to recover water from the engines' exhaust for [[Buoyancy compensator (aviation)|buoyancy compensation]]. In-flight fuel consumption continuously reduces an airship's weight and changes in the temperature of the lifting gas can do the same. Normally, expensive helium has to be valved off to compensate and any way of avoiding this is desirable. In theory, a water recovery system such as this can produce 1&nbsp;lb of ballast water for every lb of fuel burned, though this is unlikely to be achieved in practice.<ref name=\"Smith 193\"/>\n\n''Akron'' could carry up to {{convert|20700|USgal|L|abbr=on}} of gasoline ({{convert|126,000|lb|kg|abbr=on}}) in 110 separate tanks which were distributed along the lower keels to preserve the ship's trim, giving her a normal range of {{convert|5940|nmi|mi km|lk=on|abbr=on}} at cruising speed.<ref>Smith (1965). pp 180\u2013183</ref> Theoretical maximum ballast water capacity was {{convert|223,000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} in 44 bags, again distributed along her length, though normal ballast load at unmasting was {{convert|20,000|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Smith 182\"/>\n\nThe heart of the ship, and her sole reason for existing, was the airplane hangar and trapeze system. Aft of the control car, in bay VII, between frames 125 and 141.25, was a compartment large enough to accommodate up to five [[Curtiss F9C Sparrowhawk|F9C Sparrowhawk]] airplanes. However, two structural girders partially obstructed ''Akron''{{'}}s aftmost hangar bays, limiting its capacity to three airplanes (one in each forward corner of the hangar and one on the trapeze). A modification to remove this design flaw was pending at the time of the ship's loss.<ref name=\"Smith 1965. p 67\">Smith (1965). p 67</ref>\n\nThe F9C was not the ideal choice, being designed as a 'conventional' carrier-borne fighter. It was heavily built to withstand carrier landings, downward visibility was not very good and it initially lacked an effective radio. But the primary role of ''Akron''{{'}}s airplanes was long-range naval scouting. What was actually needed was a stable, fast, lightweight scouting airplane with a long range,<ref>Smith (1965). pp 27 & 201</ref> but none existed capable of fitting between the structural members and into the airship's hangar, as the F9C could.\n\nThe trapeze was lowered through the T-shaped door in the bottom of the ship and into the slipstream, with an airplane attached to the crossbar by the 'skyhook' above its top wing, its pilot on board and its engine running. The pilot tripped the hook and the airplane fell away from the ship. On his return, he positioned himself beneath the trapeze and climbed up until he could fly his skyhook onto the crossbar, at which point it automatically latched shut. Now, with the engine idling, the trapeze and airplane were raised into the hangar, the pilot cutting his engine as he passed through the door. Once inside, the airplane was transferred from the trapeze to a trolley, running on an overhead 'monorail' system by which it could be shunted into one of the four corners of the hangar to be refueled and re-armed. Having a single trapeze raised two problems: it limited the rate at which airplanes could be launched and recovered and any fault in the trapeze would leave any airborne scouts with nowhere to land. The solution was a second, fixed trapeze permanently rigged further aft along the bottom of the ship at station 102.5 and known as the 'perch'. By 1933 a perch was fitted and in use. Three more perches were planned (at stations 57.5, 80 and 147.5) but these were never fitted.<ref name=\"Smith 1965. p 67\"/>\n\n''Akron'' revived an idea used, and eventually rejected, by the German Navy [[zeppelin]]s during [[World War I]]: the ''[[Spy basket|sp\u00e4hkorb]]'' or 'spy basket'.<ref name=\"Smith 1965. p 55\">Smith (1965). p 55</ref> Intended to allow the airship to remain hidden in a cloud layer while still observing the enemy below, a small car, rather like an airplane fuselage without wings, could be lowered on a cable. The observer on board communicated with the ship by telephone. In theory, the spy basket could also be used for determining whether the air below a cloud layer was clear enough to allow a landing or if the murk reached all the way to the surface.\n\nDuring the design stage, in 1929, the navy requested an alteration to the fins. It was considered desirable for the bottom of the lower fin to be visible from the control car. [[Charles E. Rosendahl]] had witnessed, from the control room, ''[[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin|Graf Zeppelin]]'' almost snagging her fin on high-tension power lines during her heavy take off into an unsuspected but very marked temperature inversion from [[Mines Field]], Los Angeles at the start of the last leg of her round-the-world flight earlier that year.<ref>Rosendahl (1932). pp 194 et al</ref> The design change would also allow direct vision between the main control car and the emergency control position in the lower fin. The control car was moved {{convert|8|ft|m|abbr=on}} aft and all the fins were shortened and deepened. The leading edge root of the fins no longer coincided with a main (deep) ring and instead the foremost attachment was now to an intermediate ring at frame 28.75. This achieved the required visibility, improved low-speed controllability, due to the increased span of the control surfaces, and simplified stress calculations, by reducing the number of fin attachment points. The designers and the navy's inspectors, led by the very experienced Charles P Burgess, were entirely satisfied with the revised stress calculations. However, this alteration has been the subject of much criticism as an \"inherent defect\" in the design and is often alleged to have been a major factor in the loss of ''Akron''{{'}}s sister ship ''Macon''.<ref>Smith (1965). p 197</ref>\n\n==Construction and commissioning==\nConstruction of ''ZRS-4'' was begun on 31 October 1929 at the [[Goodyear Airdock]] in [[Springfield Township, Summit County, Ohio|Akron, Ohio]] by the [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear-Zeppelin Corporation]].<ref>{{cite web | publisher =via [[Akron-Summit County Public Library]] | first = | title = Goodyear-Zeppelin Corporation, Facts About the World's Largest Airship Factory & Dock | url=http://www.summitmemory.org/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/fulton&CISOPTR=97&CISOSHOW=93 | accessdate = 2008-11-15}}</ref> Because she was larger than any airship previously built in the USA, a special hangar was constructed<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=FigDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA20&dq=Popular+Science+1932+plane&hl=en&ei=k79PTYCuA4P78Abo8_3EDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CEYQ6AEwBzge#v=onepage&q&f=true \"A Nine Acre Nest For Dirigibles\"] ''Popular Science Monthly'', September 1929</ref> Chief Designer Karl Arnstein and a team of experienced German airship engineers instructed and supported design and construction of both [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] airships USS ''Akron'' and USS ''Macon''.<ref>Smith (1965). pp 7, 8, 34 & 161</ref>\n\nOn 7 November 1929, [[Rear Admiral]] [[William A. Moffett]], the Chief of the U.S. Navy's [[Bureau of Aeronautics]], drove the \"golden rivet\" in the ship's first main ring. Erection of the [[wikt:hull|hull]] sections began in March 1930. On 10 May, [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[Charles Francis Adams III|Charles Francis Adams]] chose the name ''Akron'' (for the city near where she was being built) and [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy]] [[Ernest Lee Jahncke]] announced it four days later, on 14 May 1930.\n[[File:ZRS-4 USS Akron duralumin sample.jpg|thumb|left|Sample of the [[duralumin]] from which the frame of USS ''Akron'' was built]]\n\nOn 8 August 1931, ''Akron'' was launched (floated free of the hangar floor) and  [[ship naming and launching|christened]] by First Lady [[Lou Henry Hoover]], the [[First Lady of the United States|wife]] of the President of the United States, [[Herbert Clark Hoover]]. The maiden flight of ''Akron'' took place around [[Cleveland]] on the afternoon of 23 September with Secretary of the Navy Adams and Rear Admiral Moffett on board. The airship made eight more flights\u2014principally over Lake Erie but ranging as far as [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]], [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]], and [[Columbus, Ohio]]\u2014before being flown from Akron to the [[NAS Lakehurst|Naval Air Station (NAS)]] at Lakehurst, New Jersey, where she was delivered to the Navy and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on [[Navy Day]], 27 October, with Lieutenant Commander [[Charles E. Rosendahl]] in command.\n\n==History of service==\n\n===Maiden voyage===\nOn 2 November 1931, ''Akron'' cast off for a maiden voyage as a commissioned \"ship\" of the U.S. Navy and cruised down the eastern seaboard to [[Washington, D.C.]] Over the weeks that followed, some 300 hours aloft were logged in a series of flights, including a 46-hour endurance flight to [[Mobile, Alabama]], and back. The return leg of the trip was made via the valleys of the [[Mississippi River]] and the [[Ohio River]].\n[[File:USS Akron in flight, nov 1931.jpg|thumb|right|The maiden voyage of ''Akron'' on 2 November 1931, showing her four starboard propellers.

Proceeding to the coast of [[North Carolina]], ''Akron'' headed out over the Atlantic where she was assigned to find a group of [[destroyer]]s bound for  [[Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba]]. Once these were located, the airship was to shadow them and report their movements. Leaving the coast of North Carolina at about 7:21 on the morning of 10 January, the airship proceeded south, but bad weather prevented sighting the destroyers (contact with them was missed at 12:40 EST, although their crews had sighted ''Akron'') and eventually shaped a course toward the [[Bahama]]s by late afternoon. Heading northwesterly into the night, ''Akron'' then changed course shortly before midnight and proceeded to the southeast. Ultimately, at 9:08 am on 11 January, the airship succeeded in spotting the [[light cruiser]] {{USS|Raleigh|CL-7|6}} and 12 destroyers, positively identifying them on the eastern horizon two minutes later. Sighting a second group of destroyers shortly thereafter, ''Akron'' was released from the evaluation about 10:00&nbsp;a.m., having achieved a \"qualified success\" in the initial test with the Scouting Fleet.\n\nAs the historian Richard K Smith wrote in his definitive study,<cite>The Airships ''Akron'' and ''Macon''</cite>, \"...consideration given to the weather, duration of flight, a track of more than {{convert|3000|mi|abbr=on}} flown, her material deficiencies, and the rudimentary character of aerial navigation at that date, the ''Akron'''s performance was remarkable. There was not a military airplane in the world in 1932 which could have given the same performance, operating from the same base.\"<ref>Smith (1965). p 51</ref>\n\n===First accident (February 1932)===\n''Akron'' was to have taken part in [[Fleet Problem XIII]], but an accident at Lakehurst on 22 February 1932 prevented her participation. While the airship was being taken from her hangar, the tail came loose from her moorings, was caught by the wind, and struck the ground.<ref>{{citation  |title=Sudden Gale Akron at Lakehurst NJ 1932/02/22 |date=1932 |url=https://archive.org/details/1932-02-22_Sudden_Gale_Akron_at_Lakehurst_NJ |publisher=[[Universal Newsreel|Universal Newspaper Newsreel]] |accessdate=20 February 2009}}</ref> The heaviest damage was confined to the lower fin area, which required repair. Also, ground handling fittings had been torn from the main frame, necessitating further repairs. ''Akron'' was not certified as airworthy again until later in the spring. Her next operation took place on 28 April, when she made a nine-hour flight with Rear Admiral Moffett and Secretary of the Navy Adams aboard.\n\nAs a result of this accident, a turntable with a walking beam on tracks powered by electric mine locomotives was developed to secure the tail and turn the ship even in high winds so that she could be pulled into the massive hangar at Lakehurst naval air station.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QSgDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA33&dq=Popular+Science+1931+plane&hl=en&ei=-AcLTa-vIOaJnAf7-9C4Dg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CDUQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&q&f=true|title=Popular Science|first=Bonnier|last=Corporation|date=1 April 1932|publisher=Bonnier Corporation|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\n===Testing of the \"spy basket\"===\nSoon after returning to Lakehurst to disembark her distinguished passengers, ''Akron'' took off again to conduct a test of the \"[[spy basket]]\"\u2014something like a small airplane fuselage suspended beneath the airship that would enable an observer to serve as the ship's \"eyes\" below the clouds while the ship herself remained out of sight above them. The first time the basket was tried (with sandbags aboard instead of a man), it oscillated so violently that it put the whole ship in danger. The basket proved \"frighteningly unstable\", swooping from one side of the airship to the other before the startled gaze of ''Akron''{{'}}s officers and men and reaching as high as the ship's equator.<ref name=\"Smith 1965. p 55\"/> Though it was later improved by adding a ventral stabilizing fin, the spybasket was never used again.<ref>Smith (1965). pp 133\u2013135</ref>\n\n===Experimental use as a \"flying aircraft carrier\"===\n[[File:F9C in USS Akron hangar1932.jpg|thumb|right|[[Curtiss F9C Sparrowhawk|F9C Sparrowhawk]] in ''Akron''{{'}}s hangar. This aircraft was one of four lost with {{USS|Macon|ZRS-5|6}} on 12 February 1935.]]\n\n''Akron'' and ''Macon'' (which was still under construction) were regarded as potential [[Airborne aircraft carrier|\"flying aircraft carrier]]s\", carrying [[parasite fighter]]s for reconnaissance. On 3 May 1932, ''Akron'' cruised over the coast of [[New Jersey]] with Rear Admiral [[George C. Day]]\u2014President of the [[Board of Inspection and Survey]]\u2014on board, and for the first time tested the \"trapeze\" installation for in-flight handling of aircraft. The [[naval aviator|aviator]]s who carried out those historic \"landings\"\u2014first with a Consolidated [[Fleet Model 1|N2Y]] [[Trainer aircraft|trainer]] and then with the prototype [[Curtiss F9C Sparrowhawk|Curtiss XF9C-1 Sparrowhawk]]\u2014were Lieutenant Daniel W. Harrigan and Lieutenant Howard L. Young. The following day, ''Akron'' carried out another demonstration flight, this time with members of the [[House Committee on Naval Affairs]] on board; this time, Lieutenants Harrigan and Howard gave the lawmakers a demonstration of ''Akron''{{'}}s ability to handle aircraft.\n\n===\"Coast-to-Coast\" flight and second accident (May 1932)===\n[[File:ZRS-4 USS Akron Cover 1932.jpg|thumb|left|Cover carried on the May 1932 \"Coast to Coast\" flight and later autographed by the only three survivors of the April 1933, crash of USS ''Akron''.]]\n\nFollowing the conclusion of those trial flights, ''Akron'' departed from Lakehurst, New Jersey on 8 May 1932, for the American west coast. The airship proceeded down the eastern seaboard to [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and then across the southern gulf states, continuing over Texas and [[Arizona]]. ''En route'' to [[Sunnyvale, California]], ''Akron'' reached [[Camp Kearny]] in San Diego, on the morning of 11 May and attempted to moor. Since neither trained ground handlers nor specialized [[mooring mast|mooring]] equipment were present, the landing at Camp Kearny was fraught with danger. By the time the crew started the evaluation, the helium gas had been warmed by sunlight, increasing lift. Lightened by {{convert|40|ST|t|abbr=on}}, the amount of fuel spent during the transcontinental trip, ''Akron'' was now all but uncontrollable.\n[[File:Akron incident 11 may32.jpg|thumb|right|Still pictures from 11 May 1932, incident: the two pictures on the left and the picture at far right are of Seaman Cowart; the picture second from right shows Henton and Edsall before their fatal fall]]\n\nThe mooring cable was cut to avert a catastrophic nose-stand by the errant airship which floated upward.

The deadly accident was recorded on [[newsreel]] film.\n\n===West Coast flights===\nOver the weeks that followed, ''Akron'' \"showed the flag\" on the [[West Coast of the United States]], ranging as far north as the [[Canada\u2013United States border|Canada\u2013US border]] before returning south in time to exercise once more with the Scouting Fleet. Serving as part of the \"Green Force\", the ''Akron'' attempted to locate the \"White Force\". Although opposed by [[Vought O2U Corsair]] [[floatplane]]s from \"enemy\" [[warship]]s, the airship located the opposing forces in just 22 hours, a fact not lost upon some of the participants in the exercise in subsequent critiques.\n[[File:USS Akron (ZRS-4) in flight over Manhattan, circa 1931-1933.jpg|thumb|left|''Akron'' over [[Lower Manhattan]].]]\n\nIn need of repairs, ''Akron'' departed from Sunnyvale on 11 June bound for [[Lakehurst, New Jersey]], on a return trip that was sprinkled with difficulties, mostly because of unfavorable weather, and she arrived on 15 June after a \"long and sometimes harrowing\" aerial voyage.\n\n''Akron'' next underwent a period of voyage repairs before taking part in July in a search for ''Curlew'', a yacht which had failed to reach port at the end of a race to the island of [[Bermuda]]. The yacht was later discovered safe off [[Nantucket]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,753394,00.html | work=Time | title=Sport: Cruise of the Curlew | date=18 July 1932 | accessdate=27 May 2010}}</ref> She then resumed operations capturing aircraft on the \"trapeze\" equipment. Admiral Moffett again boarded ''Akron'' on 20 July, but the next day left the airship in one of her N2Y-1s which took him back to Lakehurst after a severe storm had delayed the airship's own return to base.\n\n===Further tests as \"flying aircraft carrier\"===\n''Akron'' entered a new phase of her career that summer engaging in intense experimentation with the revolutionary \"trapeze\" and a full complement of F9C-2s. A key element of the entrance into that new phase was a new commanding officer, Commander Alger Dresel.\n\n===Third accident (August 1932)===\nAnother accident hampered training on 22 August when ''Akron''{{'}}s tail fin became fouled by a beam in Lakehurst's massive Hangar No 1 after a premature order to commence towing the ship out of the mooring circle. Nevertheless, rapid repairs enabled eight more flights over the Atlantic during the last three months of 1932. These operations involved intensive work with the trapeze and the F9C-2s, as well as the drilling of lookouts and gun crews.\n\nAmong the tasks undertaken were the maintenance of two aircraft patrolling and scouting on ''Akron''{{'}}s flanks. During a seven-hour period on 18 November 1932, the airship and a trio of planes searched a sector 100 mi wide.\n\n===Return to the fleet===\n[[File:Akron test pilots.jpg|thumb|right|Pilot officers of USS ''Akron'' Air Group, 1933 (l to r): Lt(JG) Robert W. Lawson, Lt Harold B. Miller, Lt [[Frederick M. Trapnell]], Lt Howard L. Young, Lt(JG) Frederick N. Kivette]]\n\nAfter local operations out of Lakehurst for the remainder of 1932, ''Akron'' was ready to resume operations with the fleet. On the afternoon of 3 January 1933, Commander [[Frank C. McCord]] relieved Commander Dresel as commanding officer, the latter becoming the first commanding officer of ''Akron''{{'}}s sister ship ''Macon'', whose construction was almost complete. Within hours, ''Akron'' headed south down the eastern seaboard toward Florida where, after refueling at the Naval Reserve Aviation Base, [[Opa-locka, Florida]], near Miami, the next day proceeded to Guant\u00e1namo Bay for an inspection of base sites. At this time the N2Y-1s were used to provide aerial \"taxi\" service to ferry members of the inspection party back and forth.\n\nSoon thereafter, ''Akron'' returned to Lakehurst for local operations which were interrupted by a two-week overhaul and poor weather. In March, she carried out intensive training with an aviation unit of F9C-2s, honing hook-on skills. During the course of these operations, an overfly of Washington DC was made 4 March 1933, the day [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Franklin D. Roosevelt]] first took the oath of office as President of the United States.\n\nOn 11 March, ''Akron'' departed Lakehurst bound for [[Panama]] stopping briefly ''en route'' at Opa-locka before proceeding on to [[Balboa, Panama|Balboa]] where an inspection party looked over a potential air base site. While returning northward, the airship paused at Opa-locka again for local operations exercising gun crews, with the N2Y-1s serving as targets, before getting underway for Lakehurst on 22 March.\n\n==Loss==\n[[File:ZRS-4 USS Akron Memorial Cover 1933.jpg|thumb|left|Franked USS ''Akron'' penalty cover with 1933 Memorial Day cachet autographed by its only three survivors, and postmarked at Lakehurst on 24 June 1933, the day ''Macon'' first arrived there.]]\n\nOn the evening of 3 April 1933, ''Akron'' cast off from the [[mooring mast]] to operate along the coast of [[New England]], assisting in the calibration of [[radio direction finder]] stations. Rear Admiral Moffett was again on board along with his aide, Commander Henry Barton Cecil, Commander Fred T. Berry, the commanding officer of NAS Lakehurst, and Lieutenant Colonel Alfred F. Masury, [[U.S. Army Reserve]], a guest of the admiral, the vice-president of [[Mack Trucks]], and a strong proponent of the potential civilian uses of rigid airships.\n\n''Akron'' soon encountered severe weather, which did not improve when the airship passed over [[Barnegat Light, New Jersey]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nj.com/ocean/index.ssf/2013/03/forgotten_us_airship_crash_recalled_80_years_later.html |title=Forgotten U.S. airship crash recalled 80 years later |publisher=NJ.com |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=13 March 2013 |accessdate=24 March 2014}}</ref> at 10:00&nbsp;pm as wind gusts of terrific force struck her massive airframe. The airship was being flown into an area of lower barometric pressure than at take-off, which caused the actual altitude flown to be lower than that indicated in the control gondola. Around 12:30&nbsp;a.m. on 4 April, ''Akron'' was caught by an updraft, followed almost immediately by a downdraft. Commander McCord, the captain, ordered full speed ahead, ballast dropped. The [[executive officer]], [[Lieutenant Commander]] [[Herbert V. Wiley]], handled the ballast and emptied the bow emergency ballast. Coupled with the elevator man holding the nose up, this caused the nose to rise and the tail to rotate down. The descent of ''Akron'' was only temporarily halted, before downdrafts forced the airship down farther. Wiley activated the 18 \"howlers\" of the ship's telephone system, a signal to landing stations. At this point, ''Akron'' was nose up, between 12 degrees and 25 degrees.\n\nThe engineering officer called out \"800 feet\" (240 m), which was followed by a \"gust\" of intense violence. The steersman reported no response to his wheel as the lower rudder cables had been torn away. While the control gondola was still hundreds of feet high, the lower fin of ''Akron'' had struck the water and was torn off.\n\n''Akron'' broke up rapidly and sank in the stormy Atlantic. The crew of the nearby German [[merchant ship]] ''Phoebus'' saw lights descending toward the ocean at about 12:23&nbsp;a.m. and altered course to starboard to investigate, with her captain believing that he was witnessing an airplane crash. At 12:55&nbsp;a.m., the unconscious Commander Wiley was pulled from the water while the ship's boat picked up three more men: Chief Radioman Robert W.

Smith,<ref name=\"Smith 1965. p 171\">Smith (1965). p 171</ref> ''Akron'' never got the chance to show what she was capable of. Initially, the idea had been to use her as a scout for the fleet (just as the German Navy [[zeppelin]]s had been used during [[World War I]]), with her airplanes being simply useful auxiliaries, capable of extending her range of vision or of defending her against attacking enemy aircraft.<ref>Smith (1965). p 177</ref> Gradually, in the minds of the more forward-thinking officers familiar with airship and scouting fleet operations, this was reversed: she and ''Macon'' came to be regarded as aircraft carriers, whose sole job was to get the scouting airplanes to the search area and then to support them in their flights.<ref name=\"Harrigan Report\">Report by Senior Aviator, HTA Unit to CO, Akron ZRS4/A4-3, 15 December 1932, Record Group 72, BuAer General Correspondence (1925\u20131942), Box 5592, US National Archives</ref><ref>Smith (1965). pp 51 & 107</ref> The mothership herself should stay in the background, out of sight of enemy surface units, merely acting as a mobile advanced base for the airplanes which should do all the actual searching.<ref>Smith (1965). pp 28 & 29</ref> Any aircraft carrier could do this but only an airship could do it so quickly: her speed was at least twice that of a surface ship, enabling her to get to the scene or be switched from flank to flank quickly. But this was an experimental ship, a prototype, and it took time for this doctrine and suitable tactics to evolve. It also took time to develop the techniques of navigating, controlling and coordinating the scouts. At first, developments were hampered by inadequate radio equipment<ref>Smith (1965). pp 49 & 51</ref> and by the difficulties encountered by the scout pilots in navigating, scouting and communicating from their cramped, open cockpits.<ref>Smith (1965). p 69</ref>\n\nSome politicians, some senior officers and some sections of the press seemed predisposed to judge the airship experiment a failure, without regard to the evidence. <ref>Smith (1965). pp. 51, 53, 55, 59 etc</ref> Even within the Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics, many opposed spending so much on a single asset.<ref name=\"Smith 1965. p 171\"/> Smith also asserts that political pressure from within the navy and elsewhere led to the ship being pushed too early to attempt too much.<ref>Smith (1965). p. 45 et al (especially p 56)</ref> Little allowance seems to have been made for the fact that this was a prototype, experimental system and that tactics for her use were being developed \"on the hoof\". As a result, the airship's performance in fleet exercises was not all that some had hoped and gave an exaggerated impression of the ship's vulnerability while failing to demonstrate her strengths.<ref>Smith (1965). pp 59, 171 et al</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of airship accidents]]\n* [[List of airships of the United States Navy]]\n* [[Rigid airship]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*Hook, Thomas, ''Sky Ship: the Akron Era.''
