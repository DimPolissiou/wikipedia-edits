{"title_page": "Titles of Mary", "text_new": "[[File:Our Lady of Good Counsel by Pasquale Sarullo.jpg|thumb|210px|''[[Our Lady of Good Counsel]]'' by [[Pasquale Sarullo]], 19th century.]]\n[[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] is known by many different titles (Blessed Mother, Madonna, Our Lady), [[epithet]]s ([[Our Lady, Star of the Sea|Star of the Sea]], [[Queen of Heaven]], Cause of Our Joy), invocations (''[[Theotokos]]'', ''[[Panagia]]'', Mother of Mercy) and other names ([[Our Lady of Loreto]], [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]]).\n{{Mary}}\nAll of these titles refer to the same individual named Mary, the mother of [[Jesus Christ]] (in the [[New Testament]]) and are used variably by [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholics]], [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]], and some [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]].  (Note: [[Mary Magdalene]], [[Mary of Clopas]], and [[Mary Salome]] are different individuals from Mary, mother of Jesus.)\n\nMany of the titles given to Mary are [[dogma]]tic in nature.  Other titles are poetic or allegorical and have lesser or no canonical status, but form part of [[popular piety]], with varying degrees of acceptance by the clergy.  Yet more titles refer to depictions of Mary in the [[history of art]].\n\n==Historical and cultural context==\n{{see also|History of Roman Catholic Mariology}}\n\nThere are several explanations of the significance of the relatively large number of titles given to Mary.<ref>[https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/t/titles-reasons-for.php \u201cWhy does Mary have So Many Different Titles?\u201d] ''All About Mary'', International Marian Research Institute, University of Dayton.</ref> Some titles grew due to geographic and cultural reasons, e.g., through the veneration of specific icons. Others were related to [[Marian apparitions]].\n\nMary's help is sought for a large spectrum of human needs in varied situations. This led to the formulation of many of her titles ([[Our Lady of Good Counsel|good counsel]], Help of the Sick, etc.). Moreover, meditations and devotions on the different aspects of the Virgin Mary's role within the life of Jesus led to additional titles, such as [[Our Lady of Sorrows]].<ref>Tavard, George Henry, ''The thousand faces of the Virgin Mary'' 1996 {{ISBN|0-8146-5914-4}} p. 95</ref> Still further titles have been derived from dogmas and doctrines, such as, the [[Immaculate Conception]].\n\nMary's [[Cult (religious practice)|cultus]] or \"''devotional cult''\" consolidated in the year 431 when, at the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]], the ''[[Theotokos]]'', or Mary as bearer (or mother) of God, was declared to be a [[dogma]].  Henceforth Marian devotion\u2014which centered on the subtle and complex relationship between Mary, Jesus, and the Church\u2014would flourish, first in the East and later in the West.\n\nThe [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] diminished Mary's role in many parts of Northern Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries. The [[Council of Trent]] and [[Counter Reformation]] would intensify Marian devotion in the West.  Around the same period, Mary would become an instrument of evangelization in the Americas and parts of Asia and Africa, e.g., via the apparitions at [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]], which resulted in a large number of conversions to Christianity in [[Mexico]].\n\nFollowing the Reformation, as of the 17th century, the [[baroque]] literature on Mary experienced unforeseen growth, with over 500 pages of [[Mariology|Mariological]] writings during the 17th  century alone.<ref>Roskovany, A., conceptu immacolata ex monumentis omnium seculrorum demonstrate III, Budapest 1873</ref> During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], the emphasis on [[scientific progress]] and [[rationalism]] put Catholic [[theology]] and Mariology often on the defensive in the later parts of the 18th century, to the extent that books such as ''[[The Glories of Mary]]'' (by [[Alphonsus Liguori]]) were written in defense of Mariology.\n\n==Dogmatic titles==\n* [[Mother of God]]: The [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] decreed in 431 that Mary is ''Theotokos'' because her son Jesus is both God and man: one Divine Person with two natures (divine and human).<ref>by Braaten, Carl E. and Jenson, Robert W., ''Mary, Mother of God'', 2004 {{ISBN|0802822665}} p. 84</ref> This name was translated in the West as \"Mater Dei\" or Mother of God. From this derives the title \"Blessed Mother\".\n* [[Virgin Mary]]: The doctrine of the perpetual virginity of Mary developed early in Christianity and was taught by the early Fathers, such as, [[Irenaeus]] and [[Clement of Alexandria]] (and others).<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15448a.htm Maas, Anthony. \"Virgin Birth of Christ.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 10 April 2016</ref> In the fourth century \"ever-virgin\" became a popular title for Mary.<ref>[[Donald Wuerl|Wuerl, Donald W.]] and Stubna, Kris D., [https://books.google.com/books?id=IzqDiPALzKEC&pg=PA100&dq=mary's+perpetual+virginity+dogma&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjXn_2o2oXMAhVJOD4KHXeIAaQ4ChDoAQhHMAg#v=onepage&q=mary's%20perpetual%20virginity%20dogma&f=false ''The Teaching of Christ: A Catholic Catechism for Adults''], Our Sunday Visitor Publishing, 2004, {{ISBN|9781592760947}}</ref> Variations on this include the \"Virgin Mary\", the \"Blessed Virgin\", the \"Blessed Virgin Mary\", and \"Spouse of the Holy Spirit\". The perpetual virginity of Mary was declared a dogma by the Lateran Council of 649.\n* [[Immaculate Conception]]: The dogma that Mary was conceived without original sin was defined in 1854, by [[Pope Pius IX]]'s apostolic constitution ''[[Ineffabilis Deus]]''. This gave rise to the titles of \"Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception\" and \"Queen Conceived Without Original Sin\". The Immaculate Conception is also honored under the titles of [[Our Lady of Caysasay]] (Philippines),<ref>[http://withonespast.wordpress.com/2009/11/22/ermita-nuestra-sra-de-guia/ \"In Honor of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Guia\", De Anda (2009-11-22)],</ref> [[Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn]] in [[Vilnius]], [[Our Lady of Guidance]], and [[Our Lady of Salambao]], also in the Philippines.\n*[[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]]: The belief that the Virgin Mary was assumed body and soul into heaven upon completing the course of her earthly life was declared a dogma in 1950 by [[Pope Pius XII]] in the apostolic constitution ''[[Munificentissimus Deus]]''. The titles \"Our Lady of Assumption\" and \"Queen Assumed Into Heaven\" derive from this. This dogma is also reflected in devotion to [[Ta' Pinu|Our Lady of Ta' Pinu]] on Malta.\n\n==Early titles of Mary==\n\u201cOur Lady\u201d is a common title to give to Mary as a sign of respect and honor.

[[John Bosco|Don Bosco]] promoted devotion to Mary under this title.\n* ''Stella Maris'' or [[Our Lady, Star of the Sea]] is an ancient title for the Virgin Mary, used to emphasize her role as a sign of hope and a guiding star for Christians.

Furthermore, she is related to four different dogmas and numerous Marian titles. Christians prayers, titles, and arts witness her prominent role at the site of the throne of God for the history of salvation.  \n\nIn the [[Hail Mary]] prayer, she is called \"full of [[divine grace|grace]]\" by the angel of the [[Annunciation#Eastern Christianity|Annunciation]] talking in the name of and on behalf of God. In the [[Nicene Creed]], it is narrated that Jesus was \"incarnate by the Holy Ghost and of the Virgin Mary, and was made man,\" meaning that the divine grace firstly concerns the Real Presence of the Holy Spirit into her body, the degree of her participation in the life of the Holy Trinity, as well as the amount of [[gifts of the Holy Spirit|charisms of the Holy Spirit God]] she continuously receives and that only she is allowed by God to redistribute. \n\nThe Virgin Mother of God was anointed by the Holy Spirit, summing up the anointings of the Kings, Prophets, Judges, and High Priests of Israel, as Jesus Christ did. For [[Marian apparition|Marian apparitions]] testify to her gift of prophecy, the Virgin Mary is assimilated to the [[anointing#Religion|anointed]] of Israel by her titles of: \n* Advocate of the Church (like the judges of Israel) \n* [[Mediatrix of all graces]]<ref>{{cite web | author = Mark Alessio | url = http://catholicism.org/mary-advocate-church.html | title = Mary, advocate of the Church and Mediatrix of all graces | date = 31 January 2006 | website = catholicism.org | archive-url = http://archive.is/J5Yew/ | archive-date = 9 March 2016 | url-status = live}}</ref> (like a High Priest of Israel),\n* Queen of Angels (like the kings of Israel): the [[Coronation of the Virgin]] paintings represent the [[hierarchy of angels]] of God while starting to serve Mary forever, after she has accepted to become the Mother of God.\n\nIn the Roman Catholic and in the Orthodox Church, the Virgin Mother of God is venerated in a special mode called with the Greek word [[hyperdulia]], that is secondary only to the adoration reserved to the Triune God. She is venerated and honoured in such a way since no other creature -both angelic and human- has a greater power than Mary to [[Intercession of saints#Catholic and Orthodox views|intercede]] the grace of God to His sons.\n\n==Titles associated with devotional images==\n[[File:Pe\u00f1afrancia Original Image.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Our Lady of Pe\u00f1afrancia]] in [[Naga, Camarines Sur|Naga City]], [[Philippines]]]]\n{{See also|Black Madonna}}\n* A \"Black Madonna\" (or ''Vierges Noires'') is a type of statue or painting, generally of the 12th to 15th centuries, in which Mary, and oftentimes the infant [[Jesus]], are depicted with dark features.<ref>Duricy, Michael P., [https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/b/black-madonnas-origin-history-controversy.php \u201cBlack Madonnas: Origin, History, Controversy,\u201d] ''All About Mary'', International Marian Research Institute, University of Dayton.</ref>  There are over 450 Black Madonnas in Europe.

(Note: [[Mary Magdalene]], [[Mary of Clopas]], and [[Mary Salome]] are different individuals from Mary, mother of Jesus.)\n\nMany of the titles given to Mary are [[dogma]]tic in nature.  Other titles are poetic or allegorical and have lesser or no canonical status, but form part of [[popular piety]], with varying degrees of acceptance by the clergy.  Yet more titles refer to depictions of Mary in the [[history of art]].\n\n==Historical and cultural context==\n{{see also|History of Roman Catholic Mariology}}\n\nThere are several explanations of the significance of the relatively large number of titles given to Mary.<ref>[https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/t/titles-reasons-for.php \u201cWhy does Mary have So Many Different Titles?\u201d] ''All About Mary'', International Marian Research Institute, University of Dayton.</ref> Some titles grew due to geographic and cultural reasons, e.g., through the veneration of specific icons. Others were related to [[Marian apparitions]].\n\nMary's help is sought for a large spectrum of human needs in varied situations. This led to the formulation of many of her titles ([[Our Lady of Good Counsel|good counsel]], Help of the Sick, etc.). Moreover, meditations and devotions on the different aspects of the Virgin Mary's role within the life of Jesus led to additional titles, such as [[Our Lady of Sorrows]].<ref>Tavard, George Henry, ''The thousand faces of the Virgin Mary'' 1996 {{ISBN|0-8146-5914-4}} p. 95</ref> Still further titles have been derived from dogmas and doctrines, such as, the [[Immaculate Conception]].\n\nMary's [[Cult (religious practice)|cultus]] or \"''devotional cult''\" consolidated in the year 431 when, at the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]], the ''[[Theotokos]]'', or Mary as bearer (or mother) of God, was declared to be a [[dogma]].  Henceforth Marian devotion\u2014which centered on the subtle and complex relationship between Mary, Jesus, and the Church\u2014would flourish, first in the East and later in the West.\n\nThe [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] diminished Mary's role in many parts of Northern Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries. The [[Council of Trent]] and [[Counter Reformation]] would intensify Marian devotion in the West.  Around the same period, Mary would become an instrument of evangelization in the Americas and parts of Asia and Africa, e.g., via the apparitions at [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]], which resulted in a large number of conversions to Christianity in [[Mexico]].\n\nFollowing the Reformation, as of the 17th century, the [[baroque]] literature on Mary experienced unforeseen growth, with over 500 pages of [[Mariology|Mariological]] writings during the 17th  century alone.<ref>Roskovany, A., conceptu immacolata ex monumentis omnium seculrorum demonstrate III, Budapest 1873</ref> During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], the emphasis on [[scientific progress]] and [[rationalism]] put Catholic [[theology]] and Mariology often on the defensive in the later parts of the 18th century, to the extent that books such as ''[[The Glories of Mary]]'' (by [[Alphonsus Liguori]]) were written in defense of Mariology.\n\n==Dogmatic titles==\n* [[Mother of God]]: The [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] decreed in 431 that Mary is ''Theotokos'' because her son Jesus is both God and man: one Divine Person with two natures (divine and human).<ref>by Braaten, Carl E. and Jenson, Robert W., ''Mary, Mother of God'', 2004 {{ISBN|0802822665}} p. 84</ref> This name was translated in the West as \"Mater Dei\" or Mother of God. From this derives the title \"Blessed Mother\".\n* [[Virgin Mary]]: The doctrine of the perpetual virginity of Mary developed early in Christianity and was taught by the early Fathers, such as, [[Irenaeus]] and [[Clement of Alexandria]] (and others).<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15448a.htm Maas, Anthony. \"Virgin Birth of Christ.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 10 April 2016</ref> In the fourth century \"ever-virgin\" became a popular title for Mary.<ref>[[Donald Wuerl|Wuerl, Donald W.]] and Stubna, Kris D., [https://books.google.com/books?id=IzqDiPALzKEC&pg=PA100&dq=mary's+perpetual+virginity+dogma&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjXn_2o2oXMAhVJOD4KHXeIAaQ4ChDoAQhHMAg#v=onepage&q=mary's%20perpetual%20virginity%20dogma&f=false ''The Teaching of Christ: A Catholic Catechism for Adults''], Our Sunday Visitor Publishing, 2004, {{ISBN|9781592760947}}</ref> Variations on this include the \"Virgin Mary\", the \"Blessed Virgin\", the \"Blessed Virgin Mary\", and \"Spouse of the Holy Spirit\". The perpetual virginity of Mary was declared a dogma by the Lateran Council of 649.\n* [[Immaculate Conception]]: The dogma that Mary was conceived without original sin was defined in 1854, by [[Pope Pius IX]]'s apostolic constitution ''[[Ineffabilis Deus]]''. This gave rise to the titles of \"Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception\" and \"Queen Conceived Without Original Sin\". The Immaculate Conception is also honored under the titles of [[Our Lady of Caysasay]] (Philippines),<ref>[http://withonespast.wordpress.com/2009/11/22/ermita-nuestra-sra-de-guia/ \"In Honor of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Guia\", De Anda (2009-11-22)],</ref> [[Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn]] in [[Vilnius]], [[Our Lady of Guidance]], and [[Our Lady of Salambao]], also in the Philippines.\n*[[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]]: The belief that the Virgin Mary was assumed body and soul into heaven upon completing the course of her earthly life was declared a dogma in 1950 by [[Pope Pius XII]] in the apostolic constitution ''[[Munificentissimus Deus]]''. The titles \"Our Lady of Assumption\" and \"Queen Assumed Into Heaven\" derive from this. This dogma is also reflected in devotion to [[Ta' Pinu|Our Lady of Ta' Pinu]] on Malta.\n\n==Early titles of Mary==\n\u201cOur Lady\u201d is a common title to give to Mary as a sign of respect and honor. In French she is called \"Notre Dame\" and in Spanish she is \"Nuestra Se\u00f1ora\".<ref>[http://www.dolr.org/article/marian-titles-chosen-one-out-four-churches-diocese Hargett, Malea. \"Marian titles chosen for one out of four churches in diocese\", ''Arkansas Catholic'', Diocese of Arkansas, May 20, 2006]</ref>\n\n* Mary was identified as the \"[[Nova Eva|New Eve]]\" as early as the later half of the Second Century. [[Justin Martyr]] (100\u2013165) draws the connection in his ''[[Dialogue with Trypho]]''. This idea is later expanded by [[Irenaeus]].<ref>Mauriello, Matthew R., [http://www.freifrancisco.com.br/2014/08/mary-new-eve-mariology.html \u201cMary the New Eve,\u201d] ''Frei Francisco''.</ref>\n* [[John Chrysostom]], in 345, was the first person to use the Marian title [[Mary Help of Christians]] as a devotion to the Virgin Mary. [[John Bosco|Don Bosco]] promoted devotion to Mary under this title.\n* ''Stella Maris'' or [[Our Lady, Star of the Sea]] is an ancient title for the Virgin Mary, used to emphasize her role as a sign of hope and a guiding star for Christians. It is attributed to [[Jerome]] and cited by [[Paschasius Radbertus]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=150| English !! width=100| Latin !! width=100| Greek !!

Furthermore, she is related to four different dogmas and numerous Marian titles. Christians prayers, titles, and arts witness her prominent role at the site of the throne of God for the history of salvation.  \n\nIn the [[Hail Mary]] prayer, she is called \"full of [[divine grace|grace]]\" by the angel of the [[Annunciation#Eastern Christianity|Annunciation]] talking in the name and on behalf of God. In the [[Nicene Creed]], it is narrated that Jesus was \"incarnate by the Holy Ghost and of the Virgin Mary, and was made man,\" meaning that the divine grace firstly concerns the Real Presence of the Holy Spirit into her body, the degree of her participation in the life of the Holy Trinity, as well as the amount of [[Gifts of the Holy Spirit|charisms of the Holy Spirit God]] she continuously receives and that only she is allowed by God to redistribute. \n\nThe Virgin Mother of God was anointed by the Holy Spirit God, summing up the anointings of the Kings, Prophets, Judges and High Priests of Israel, like Jesus Christ God did. For [[Marian apparition|Marian apparitions]] testify to her gift of prophecy, the Virgin Mary is assimilated to the [[anointing#Religion|anointed]] of Israel by her titles of: \n* Advocate of the Church (like the judges of Israel) \n* [[Mediatrix of all graces]]<ref>{{cite web | author = Mark Alessio | url = http://catholicism.org/mary-advocate-church.html | title = Mary, advocate of the Church and Mediatrix of all graces | date = 31 January 2006 | website = catholicism.org | archive-url = http://archive.is/J5Yew/ | archive-date = 9 March 2016 | url-status = live}}</ref> (like a High Priest of Israel),\n* Queen of Angels (like the kings of Israel): the [[Coronation of the Virgin]] paintings represent the [[hierarchy of angels]] of God while starting to serve Mary forever, after she has accepted to become the Mother of God.\n\nIn the Roman Catholic and in the Orthodox Church, the Virgin Mother of God is venerated in a special mode called with the Greek word [[hyperdulia]], that is secondary only to the adoration reserved to the Triune God. She is venerated and honoured in such a way since no other creature -both angelic and human- has a greater power than Mary to [[Intercession of saints#Catholic and Orthodox views|intercede]] the grace of God to His sons.\n\n==Titles associated with devotional images==\n[[File:Pe\u00f1afrancia Original Image.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Our Lady of Pe\u00f1afrancia]] in [[Naga, Camarines Sur|Naga City]], [[Philippines]]]]\n{{See also|Black Madonna}}\n* A \"Black Madonna\" (or ''Vierges Noires'') is a type of statue or painting, generally of the 12th to 15th centuries, in which Mary, and oftentimes the infant [[Jesus]], are depicted with dark features.<ref>Duricy, Michael P., [https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/b/black-madonnas-origin-history-controversy.php \u201cBlack Madonnas: Origin, History, Controversy,\u201d] ''All About Mary'', International Marian Research Institute, University of Dayton.</ref>  There are over 450 Black Madonnas in Europe.
