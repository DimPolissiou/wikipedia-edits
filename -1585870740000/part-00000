Despite this, since the late 20th century the number of high-rise apartment buildings and office blocks in many large British cities has grown significantly, most notably in London and Manchester. The three tallest residential buildings in the UK are: Manchester's [[Deansgate_Square|Deansgate Square South Tower]] (201m), London's [[St George Wharf Tower]] (181m) and Manchester's [[Beetham_Tower,_Manchester|Beetham Tower]] (169m). \n\nAs of April 2019, there are 54 habitable buildings {{convert|100|m|ft}} tall under construction in the UK \u2013 43 in London, 5 in Manchester, 3 in Birmingham, 3 in Liverpool, and 1 in [[Woking]].\n\n==Tallest existing buildings==\n\n<!-- NOTE ON UPDATING LIST: When updating or adding a building, please make sure the rankings are amended alongside the table near the top of this article. -->\nThis list includes completed buildings in the UK that stand at least {{convert|100|m|ft}} tall.

Its ruins lie within the modern [[Egypt]]ian [[list of Egyptian cities|city]] of [[Luxor]]. Thebes was the main city of the fourth Upper Egyptian [[Nome (Egypt)|nome]] (Sceptre nome) and was the capital of Egypt for long periods during the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] and [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]] eras. It was close to [[Nubia]] and the [[Eastern Desert]], with its valuable mineral resources and trade routes. It was a [[Theban Triad|cult center]] and the most venerated city of ancient Egypt during its heyday. The site of Thebes includes areas on both the eastern bank of the Nile, where the temples of [[Karnak]] and [[Luxor Temple|Luxor]] stand and where the city proper was situated; and the western bank, where a [[Theban Necropolis|necropolis]] of large private and royal cemeteries and funerary complexes can be found.\n{{anchor|Toponym|Etymology}}\n\n==Toponymy==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none;\"\n|<center>{{hiero|''w\ua723s.t''<br/>\"City of the Scepter\"<ref>Adolf Erman and Hermann Grapow: ''W\u00f6rterbuch der \u00e4gyptischen Sprache.''

The name was therefore translated into Greek as Diospolis, \"City of Zeus\". To distinguish it from the numerous other cities by this name, it was known as the {{nowrap|\"Great Diospolis\"}} ({{lang|grc|\u0394\u03b9\u03cc\u03c3\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2 \u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7}}, ''Diospolis Meg\u00e1l\u0113''; {{lang-la|Diospolis Magna}}). The Greek names came into wider use after the conquest of Egypt by [[Alexander the Great]], when the country came to be ruled by the [[Ancient Macedonia|Macedonian]] [[Ptolemaic dynasty]].\n\n==Characteristics==\n===Geography===\nThebes was located along the banks of the [[Nile River|Nile]] River in the middle part of [[Upper Egypt]] about 800&nbsp;km south of the [[Nile Delta|Delta]]. It was built largely on the [[alluvial plains]] of the [[Nile Valley]] which follows a great bend of the Nile. As a natural consequence, the city was laid in a northeast-southwest axis parallel to the contemporary river channel. Thebes had an area of 93&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (36 sq mi) which included parts of the Theban Hills in the west that culminates at the sacred 420-meter (1,378-foot) [[al-Qurn]]. In the east lies the mountainous [[Eastern Desert]] with its [[wadi]]s draining into the valley. Significant among these wadis is [[Wadi Hammamat]] near Thebes. It was used as an overland trade route going to the [[Red Sea]] coast.\n\nNearby towns in the fourth Upper Egyptian [[Nome (Egypt)|nome]] were [[Gebelein|Per-Hathor]], [[Medamud|Madu]], [[El-Tod|Djerty]], [[Hermonthis|Iuny]], [[Sumenu|Sumenu and Imiotru]].<ref>Wilkinson, T.

The major festivals among these, according to the Edfu Geographical Text, were: the [[Opet Festival|Beautiful Feast of Opet]], the Khoiak (Festival), Festival of I [[Shemu]], and Festival of II Shemu.

At this time it was still a small trading post, while [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] served as the royal residence of the [[Old Kingdom]] pharaohs. Although no buildings survive in Thebes older than portions of the Karnak temple complex that may date from the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]], the lower part of a statue of Pharaoh [[Nyuserre Ini|Nyuserre]] of the [[5th Dynasty]] has been found in Karnak. Another statue which was dedicated by the [[12th Dynasty]] king Senusret may have been usurped and re-used, since the statue bears a cartouche of Nyuserre on its belt. Since seven rulers of the [[Fourth Dynasty of Egypt|4th]] to [[Sixth Dynasty of Egypt|6th]] Dynasties appear on the Karnak king list, perhaps at the least there was a temple in the Theban area which dated to the Old Kingdom.\n\n===First Intermediate Period===\nBy 2160 BC, a new line of pharaohs (the [[Ninth Dynasty of Egypt|Ninth]] and [[Tenth Dynasty of Egypt|Tenth]] Dynasties) consolidated control over [[Lower Egypt]] and northern parts of [[Upper Egypt]] from their capital in [[Herakleopolis Magna]]. A rival line (the [[Eleventh Dynasty of Egypt|Eleventh Dynasty]]), based at Thebes, ruled the remaining part of Upper Egypt. The Theban rulers were apparently descendants of the [[iry-pat|prince]] of Thebes, [[Intef the Elder]]. His probable grandson [[Intef I]] was the first of the family to claim in life a partial [[Ancient Egyptian royal titulary|pharaonic titulary]], though his power did not extend much further than the general Theban region.\n\n===Middle Kingdom===\n[[File:Intef I.jpg|thumbnail|thumbnail|140px|left|[[Serekh]] of Intef I inscribed posthumously for him by Mentuhotep II]]\n\nFinally by c. 2050 BC, [[Intef III]]'s son [[Mentuhotep II]] (meaning \"Montu is satisfied\"), took the Herakleopolitans by force and reunited Egypt once again under one ruler, thereby starting the period now known as the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]]. Mentuhotep II ruled for 51 years and built the first mortuary temple at [[Deir el-Bahri]], which most likely served as the inspiration for the later and larger temple built next to it by Hatshepsut in the 18th Dynasty. After these events, the 11th Dynasty was short-lived, as less than twenty years had elapsed between the death of Mentuhotep II and that of [[Mentuhotep IV]], in mysterious circumstances.\n\nDuring the [[12th Dynasty]], [[Amenemhat I]] moved the seat of power North to [[Itjtawy]]. Thebes continued to thrive as a religious center as the local god [[Amun]] was becoming increasingly prominent throughout Egypt. The oldest remains of a temple dedicated to Amun date to the reign of [[Senusret I]].<ref>{{Citation|title=Amun|date=2019-10-12|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amun&oldid=920810357|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-10-28}}</ref> Thebes was already, in the Middle Kingdom, a town of considerable size.

They eventually founded the [[Fourteenth Dynasty of Egypt|14th Dynasty]] at [[Avaris]] in c. 1805 BC or c. 1710 BC. By doing so, the Asiatics established hegemony over the majority of the Delta region, subtracting these territories from the influence of the [[13th Dynasty]] that had meanwhile succeeded the 12th.<ref>{{cite book |last= Wilkinson |first= Toby |authorlink= Toby Wilkinson |date=2011 |title= The Rise and Fall of Ancient Egypt |url=https://books.google.it/books?hl=it&id=P07rgiJjsk4C&q=nehesy#v=snippet&q=nehesy&f=false |location=New York |publisher= Random House |page=560 |isbn=9780747599494 }}, pp. 183-187</ref>\n\n===Second Intermediate Period===\n[[File:Beni Hassan (Lepsius, BH 3) 03.jpg|thumbnail|upright=1.2|Depiction of Asiatic (left) and Egyptian people (right).

The Thebans resisted the Hyksos' further advance by making an agreement for a peaceful concurrent rule between them. The Hyksos were able to sail upstream past Thebes to trade with the [[Nubians]] and the Thebans brought their herds to the Delta without adversaries. The status quo continued until Hyksos ruler [[Apepi (pharaoh)|Apophis]] ([[Fifteenth Dynasty of Egypt|15th Dynasty]]) insulted [[Seqenenre Tao]] ([[Seventeenth Dynasty of Egypt|17th Dynasty]]) of Thebes. Soon the armies of Thebes marched on the Hyksos-ruled lands. Tao died in battle and his son [[Kamose]] took charge of the campaign. After Kamose's death, his brother [[Ahmose I]] continued until he captured [[Avaris]], the Hyksos capital.

Her successor [[Thutmose III]] brought to Thebes a great deal of his war booty that originated from as far away as [[Mittani]]. The 18th Dynasty reached its peak during his great-grandson [[Amenhotep III]]'s reign (1388\u20131350 BC). Aside from embellishing the temples of Amun, Amenhotep increased construction in Thebes to unprecedented levels. On the west bank, he built the enormous [[Mortuary Temple of Amenhotep III|mortuary temple]] and the equally massive [[Malkata]] palace-city which fronted a 364-hectare artificial lake. In the city proper he built the [[Luxor Temple|Luxor]] temple and the Avenue of the Sphinxes leading to Karnak.\n\nFor a brief period in the reign of Amenhotep III's son [[Akhenaten]] (1351\u20131334 BC), Thebes fell on hard times; the city was abandoned by the court, and the worship of Amun was proscribed. The capital was moved to the new city of [[Amarna|Akhetaten]] (Amarna in modern Egypt), midway between Thebes and Memphis.

However, the whole of Egypt was experiencing financial problems, exemplified in the events at Thebes' village of [[Deir el-Medina]]. In the 25th year of his reign, workers in Deir el-Medina began striking for pay and there arose a general unrest of all social classes.

During the reign of [[Ramesses IX]] (1129\u20131111 BC), about 1114 BC, a series of investigations into the plundering of royal tombs in the necropolis of western Thebes uncovered proof of corruption in high places, following an accusation made by the mayor of the east bank against his colleague on the west. The plundered royal mummies were moved from place to place and at last deposited by the priests of Amun in a tomb-shaft in [[Deir el-Bahri]] and in the tomb of [[Amenhotep II]]. (The finding of these two hiding places in 1881 and 1898, respectively, was one of the great events of modern archaeological discovery.) Such maladministration in Thebes led to unrest.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n===Third Intermediate Period===\nControl of local affairs tended to come more and more into the hands of the [[Theban High Priests of Amun|High Priests of Amun]], so that during the [[Third Intermediate Period]], the High Priest of Amun exerted absolute power over the South, a counterbalance to the [[21st Dynasty|21st]] and [[22nd Dynasty]] kings who ruled from the Delta. Intermarriage and adoption strengthened the ties between them, daughters of the Tanite kings being installed as God\u2019s Wife of Amun at Thebes, where they wielded greater power. Theban political influence receded only in the Late Period.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nBy around 750 BC, the [[Kushites]] (Nubians) were growing their influence over Thebes and Upper Egypt. [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]], the former colony of Egypt became an empire in itself. In 721 BC, King [[Shabaka]] of the Kushites defeated the combined forces of [[Osorkon IV]] ([[22nd Dynasty]]), [[Peftjauawybast]] ([[23rd Dynasty]]) [[Bakenranef]] ([[Twenty-fourth Dynasty of Egypt|24th Dynasty]]) and reunified Egypt yet again. His reign saw a significant amount of building work undertaken throughout Egypt, especially at the city of Thebes, which he made the capital of his kingdom. In [[Karnak]] he erected a pink granite statue of himself wearing the [[Pschent]] (the double crown of Egypt). [[Taharqa]] accomplished many notable projects at Thebes (i.e. the Kiosk in Karnak) and Nubia before the Assyrians started to wage war against Egypt.\n\n===Late Period===\n[[File:Karnak Taharkas\u00e4ule 01.JPG|thumb|150px|right|A column of [[Taharqa]] at the precinct of Amun-Re at Karnak Temple restored to full height]]\n\nIn 667 BC, attacked by the [[Assyria]]n king [[Ashurbanipal]]'s army, Taharqa abandoned Lower Egypt and fled to Thebes. After his death three years later his nephew (or cousin) [[Tantamani]] seized Thebes, invaded Lower Egypt and laid siege to Memphis, but abandoned his attempts to conquer the country in 663 BC and retreated southwards.{{citation needed|reason=citation needed for these dates and statements|date=July 2016}} The Assyrians pursued him and [[Sack of Thebes|took Thebes]], whose name was added to a long list of cities plundered and destroyed by the Assyrians, as Ashurbanipal wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"This city, the whole of it, I conquered it with the help of Ashur and Ishtar. Silver, gold, precious stones, all the wealth of the palace, rich cloth, precious linen, great horses, supervising men and women, two obelisks of splendid electrum, weighing 2,500 talents, the doors of temples I tore from their bases and carried them off to Assyria. With this weighty booty I left Thebes. Against Egypt and Kush I have lifted my spear and shown my power. With full hands I have returned to Nineveh, in good health.\"{{citation needed|reason=where is this quote from?  It needs a citation.|date=July 2016}}\n</blockquote>\n\nThebes never regained its former political significance, but it remained an important religious centre. Assyrians installed [[Psamtik I]] (664-610 BC), who ascended to Thebes in 656 BC and brought about the adoption of his own daughter, [[Nitocris I]], as heiress to God's Wife of Amun there. In 525 BC, Persian [[Cambyses II]] invaded Egypt and became pharaoh, subordinating the kingdom as a [[satrapy]] to the greater [[Achaemenid Empire]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n===Graeco-Roman Period===\n[[File:Temple of Deir el-Medina 18.JPG|thumb|150px|right|Relief in [[Hathor]] temple, Deir el-Medina (built during the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic Dynasty]])]]\n\nThe good relationship of the Thebans with the central power in the North ended when the native Egyptian pharaohs were finally replaced by Greeks, led by [[Alexander the Great]]. He visited Thebes during a celebration of the [[Opet Festival]]. In spite of his welcoming visit, Thebes became a center for dissent. Towards the end of the third century BC, [[Hugronaphor]] (Horwennefer), possibly of Nubian origin, led a revolt against the Ptolemies in Upper Egypt. His successor, [[Ankhmakis]], held large parts of Upper Egypt until 185 BC. This revolt was supported by the Theban priesthood. After the suppression of the revolt in 185 BC, [[Ptolemy V]], in need of the support of the priesthood, forgave them.\n\nHalf a century later the Thebans rose again, elevating a certain [[Harsiesi]] to the throne in 132 BC. Harsiesi, having helped himself to the funds of the royal bank at Thebes, fled the following year. In 91 BC, another revolt broke out. In the following years, Thebes was subdued, and the city turned into rubble.<ref>[http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/the_destruction_of_thebes.htm The fall of Thebes to the Assyrians and its decline thereafter]. http://www.reshafim.org.il/.

Although no buildings survive in Thebes older than portions of the Karnak temple complex that may date from the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]], the lower part of a statue of Pharaoh [[Nyuserre Ini|Nyuserre]] of the [[5th Dynasty]] has been found in Karnak. Another statue which was dedicated by the [[12th Dynasty]] king Senusret may have been usurped and re-used, since the statue bears a cartouche of Nyuserre on its belt. Since seven rulers of the [[Fourth Dynasty of Egypt|4th]] to [[Sixth Dynasty of Egypt|6th]] Dynasties appear on the Karnak king list, perhaps at the least there was a temple in the Theban area which dated to the Old Kingdom.\n\n===First Intermediate Period===\nBy 2160 BC, a new line of pharaohs (the [[Ninth Dynasty of Egypt|Ninth]] and [[Tenth Dynasty of Egypt|Tenth]] Dynasties) consolidated control over [[Lower Egypt]] and northern parts of [[Upper Egypt]] from their capital in [[Herakleopolis Magna]]. A rival line (the [[Eleventh Dynasty of Egypt|Eleventh Dynasty]]), based at Thebes, ruled the remaining part of Upper Egypt. The Theban rulers were apparently descendants of the [[iry-pat|prince]] of Thebes, [[Intef the Elder]]. His probable grandson [[Intef I]] was the first of the family to claim in life a partial [[Ancient Egyptian royal titulary|pharaonic titulary]], though his power did not extend much further than the general Theban region.\n\n===Middle Kingdom===\n[[File:Intef I.jpg|thumbnail|thumbnail|140px|left|[[Serekh]] of Intef I inscribed posthumously for him by Mentuhotep II]]\n\nFinally by c. 2050 BC, [[Intef III]]'s son [[Mentuhotep II]] (meaning \"Montu is satisfied\"), took the Herakleopolitans by force and reunited Egypt once again under one ruler, thereby starting the period now known as the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]]. Mentuhotep II ruled for 51 years and built the first mortuary temple at [[Deir el-Bahri]], which most likely served as the inspiration for the later and larger temple built next to it by Hatshepsut in the 18th Dynasty. After these events, the 11th Dynasty was short-lived, as less than twenty years had elapsed between the death of Mentuhotep II and that of [[Mentuhotep IV]], in mysterious circumstances.\n\nDuring the [[12th Dynasty]], [[Amenemhat I]] moved the seat of power North to [[Itjtawy]]. Thebes continued to thrive as a religious center as the local god [[Amun]] was becoming increasingly prominent throughout Egypt. The oldest remains of a temple dedicated to Amun date to the reign of [[Senusret I]].<ref>{{Citation|title=Amun|date=2019-10-12|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amun&oldid=920810357|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-10-28}}</ref> Thebes was already, in the Middle Kingdom, a town of considerable size.

The Thebans resisted the Hyksos' further advance by making an agreement for a peaceful concurrent rule between them. The Hyksos were able to sail upstream past Thebes to trade with the [[Nubians]] and the Thebans brought their herds to the Delta without adversaries. The status quo continued until Hyksos ruler [[Apepi (pharaoh)|Apophis]] ([[Fifteenth Dynasty of Egypt|15th Dynasty]]) insulted [[Seqenenre Tao]] ([[Seventeenth Dynasty of Egypt|17th Dynasty]]) of Thebes. Soon the armies of Thebes marched on the Hyksos-ruled lands. Tao died in battle and his son [[Kamose]] took charge of the campaign. After Kamose's death, his brother [[Ahmose I]] continued until he captured [[Avaris]], the Hyksos capital.

After this, colossal enlargements of the temple became the norm throughout the New Kingdom.\n\nQueen [[Hatshepsut]] (reigned 1479-1458 BC) helped the Theban economy flourish by renewing trade networks, primarily the Red Sea trade between Thebes' Red Sea port of [[Al-Qusayr, Egypt|Al-Qusayr]], [[Eilat|Elat]] and the land of [[Land of Punt|Punt]]. Her successor [[Thutmose III]] brought to Thebes a great deal of his war booty that originated from as far away as [[Mittani]]. The 18th Dynasty reached its peak during his great-grandson [[Amenhotep III]]'s reign (1388\u20131350 BC). Aside from embellishing the temples of Amun, Amenhotep increased construction in Thebes to unprecedented levels. On the west bank, he built the enormous [[Mortuary Temple of Amenhotep III|mortuary temple]] and the equally massive [[Malkata]] palace-city which fronted a 364-hectare artificial lake. In the city proper he built the [[Luxor Temple|Luxor]] temple and the Avenue of the Sphinxes leading to Karnak.\n\nFor a brief period in the reign of Amenhotep III's son [[Akhenaten]] (1351\u20131334 BC), Thebes fell on hard times; the city was abandoned by the court, and the worship of Amun was proscribed. The capital was moved to the new city of [[Amarna|Akhetaten]] (Amarna in modern Egypt), midway between Thebes and Memphis. After his death, his son [[Tutankhamun]] returned the capital to Memphis,<ref>J. van Dijk: ''''The Amarna Period and the later New Kingdom'', in: I.

Thebes maintained its revenues and prestige through the reigns of [[Seti I]] (1290\u20131279 BC) and [[Ramesses II]] (1279\u20131213 BC), who still resided for part of every year in Thebes.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Ramesses II carried out extensive building projects in the city, such as statues and obelisks, the third enclosure wall of [[Karnak]] temple, additions to the [[Luxor Temple|Luxor]] temple, and the [[Ramesseum]], his grand [[mortuary temple]].

The [[Papyrus Harris I|Great Harris Papyrus]] states that [[Ramesses III]] (reigned 1187\u201356) donated 86,486 slaves and vast estates to the temples of Amun. Ramesses III received tributes from all subject peoples including the [[Sea Peoples]] and [[Meshwesh]] Libyans. However, the whole of Egypt was experiencing financial problems, exemplified in the events at Thebes' village of [[Deir el-Medina]]. In the 25th year of his reign, workers in Deir el-Medina began striking for pay and there arose a general unrest of all social classes. Subsequently, an unsuccessful harem revolt led to the executions of many conspirators, including Theban officials and women.<ref>[http://www.greatdreams.com/thebes/ramiii.htm RAMESSES III: THE LAST GREAT PHARAOH]. http://www.greatdreams.com/. Retrieved on 2016-02-06.</ref>\n\nUnder the later Ramessids, Thebes began to decline as the government fell into grave economic difficulties. During the reign of [[Ramesses IX]] (1129\u20131111 BC), about 1114 BC, a series of investigations into the plundering of royal tombs in the necropolis of western Thebes uncovered proof of corruption in high places, following an accusation made by the mayor of the east bank against his colleague on the west. The plundered royal mummies were moved from place to place and at last deposited by the priests of Amun in a tomb-shaft in [[Deir el-Bahri]] and in the tomb of [[Amenhotep II]]. (The finding of these two hiding places in 1881 and 1898, respectively, was one of the great events of modern archaeological discovery.) Such maladministration in Thebes led to unrest.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n===Third Intermediate Period===\nControl of local affairs tended to come more and more into the hands of the [[Theban High Priests of Amun|High Priests of Amun]], so that during the [[Third Intermediate Period]], the High Priest of Amun exerted absolute power over the South, a counterbalance to the [[21st Dynasty|21st]] and [[22nd Dynasty]] kings who ruled from the Delta. Intermarriage and adoption strengthened the ties between them, daughters of the Tanite kings being installed as God\u2019s Wife of Amun at Thebes, where they wielded greater power. Theban political influence receded only in the Late Period.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nBy around 750 BC, the [[Kushites]] (Nubians) were growing their influence over Thebes and Upper Egypt. [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]], the former colony of Egypt became an empire in itself. In 721 BC, King [[Shabaka]] of the Kushites defeated the combined forces of [[Osorkon IV]] ([[22nd Dynasty]]), [[Peftjauawybast]] ([[23rd Dynasty]]) [[Bakenranef]] ([[Twenty-fourth Dynasty of Egypt|24th Dynasty]]) and reunified Egypt yet again. His reign saw a significant amount of building work undertaken throughout Egypt, especially at the city of Thebes, which he made the capital of his kingdom. In [[Karnak]] he erected a pink granite statue of himself wearing the [[Pschent]] (the double crown of Egypt). [[Taharqa]] accomplished many notable projects at Thebes (i.e. the Kiosk in Karnak) and Nubia before the Assyrians started to wage war against Egypt.\n\n===Late Period===\n[[File:Karnak Taharkas\u00e4ule 01.JPG|thumb|150px|right|A column of [[Taharqa]] at the precinct of Amun-Re at Karnak Temple restored to full height]]\n\nIn 667 BC, attacked by the [[Assyria]]n king [[Ashurbanipal]]'s army, Taharqa abandoned Lower Egypt and fled to Thebes. After his death three years later his nephew (or cousin) [[Tantamani]] seized Thebes, invaded Lower Egypt and laid siege to Memphis, but abandoned his attempts to conquer the country in 663 BC and retreated southwards.{{citation needed|reason=citation needed for these dates and statements|date=July 2016}} The Assyrians pursued him and [[Sack of Thebes|took Thebes]], whose name was added to a long list of cities plundered and destroyed by the Assyrians, as Ashurbanipal wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"This city, the whole of it, I conquered it with the help of Ashur and Ishtar. Silver, gold, precious stones, all the wealth of the palace, rich cloth, precious linen, great horses, supervising men and women, two obelisks of splendid electrum, weighing 2,500 talents, the doors of temples I tore from their bases and carried them off to Assyria. With this weighty booty I left Thebes. Against Egypt and Kush I have lifted my spear and shown my power. With full hands I have returned to Nineveh, in good health.\"{{citation needed|reason=where is this quote from?  It needs a citation.|date=July 2016}}\n</blockquote>\n\nThebes never regained its former political significance, but it remained an important religious centre. Assyrians installed [[Psamtik I]] (664-610 BC), who ascended to Thebes in 656 BC and brought about the adoption of his own daughter, [[Nitocris I]], as heiress to God's Wife of Amun there. In 525 BC, Persian [[Cambyses II]] invaded Egypt and became pharaoh, subordinating the kingdom as a [[satrapy]] to the greater [[Achaemenid Empire]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n===Graeco-Roman Period===\n[[File:Temple of Deir el-Medina 18.JPG|thumb|150px|right|Relief in [[Hathor]] temple, Deir el-Medina (built during the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic Dynasty]])]]\n\nThe good relationship of the Thebans with the central power in the North ended when the native Egyptian pharaohs were finally replaced by Greeks, led by [[Alexander the Great]]. He visited Thebes during a celebration of the [[Opet Festival]]. In spite of his welcoming visit, Thebes became a center for dissent. Towards the end of the third century BC, [[Hugronaphor]] (Horwennefer), possibly of Nubian origin, led a revolt against the Ptolemies in Upper Egypt. His successor, [[Ankhmakis]], held large parts of Upper Egypt until 185 BC. This revolt was supported by the Theban priesthood. After the suppression of the revolt in 185 BC, [[Ptolemy V]], in need of the support of the priesthood, forgave them.\n\nHalf a century later the Thebans rose again, elevating a certain [[Harsiesi]] to the throne in 132 BC. Harsiesi, having helped himself to the funds of the royal bank at Thebes, fled the following year. In 91 BC, another revolt broke out. In the following years, Thebes was subdued, and the city turned into rubble.<ref>[http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/the_destruction_of_thebes.htm The fall of Thebes to the Assyrians and its decline thereafter]. http://www.reshafim.org.il/.

The main features of this temple are its ten large [[Pylon (architecture)|pylon]]s, the [[Great Hypostyle Hall]], a sacred lake, sub-temples, numerous shrines and multiple [[obelisk]]s.

The term lasted from 12 March 1967 until 27 March 1968, when Soeharto was officially inaugurated as the definitive [[President of Indonesia]].\n\n==Election to the acting presidency==\nBy February 1967, President [[Soekarno]] realized that his political career was at an end and he became concerned at cutting his losses. On 7 February, he sent a letter to Soeharto saying that he was willing to hand over the running of the government to the General but also added that he would like to continue on as head of state.<ref>{{cite book |last= Elson |first= Robert |title= Suharto: A Political Biography |year= 2001 |publisher= The Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge |location= UK |language= |isbn=0-521-77326-1 |pages= 156}}</ref> In the time between the arrival of that letter and the formulation of the reply, the [[People's Representative Council]] (DPR) passed a resolution which called for a Special Session of the Provisional [[People's Consultative Assembly]] (MPRS). Soeharto, accompanied by the commanders of the Navy, Air Force, and Police, met with Soekarno on 11 February to reject his offer and to wait instead for the result of the MPRS Special Session.<ref name=\"tempo.co.id\">{{cite news\n |author=MIS \n |url=http://www.tempo.co.id/ang/min/02/05/utama7.htm \n |title=Saat-Saat Jatuhnya Presiden Soekarno: Perjalanan Terakhir Bung Besar \n |publisher=Tempo \n |date=1997-04-05 \n |accessdate=2007-11-25 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228031202/http://www.tempo.co.id/ang/min/02/05/utama7.htm \n |archivedate=28 February 2008 \n |df=dmy \n}}</ref> \n\nOn 20 February 1967, Soekarno chose to relinquish all executive power to Soeharto whilst still retaining his position as president.<ref name=\"tempo.co.id\"/> Soekarno's decision did not stop the DPR from insisting that the MPRS Special Session go ahead. Originally calling for an MPRS Special Session to be held for the purpose of reviewing Soekarno's performance as well as reaching a final decision on whether or not he was involved with the [[30 September Movement]] (G30S), the DPR now asked that the MPRS Special Session add Soeharto's election as acting president to the agenda.\n\nThe Special Session was opened on 7 March 1967. On that day, Soeharto delivered a speech absolving Soekarno of any involvement with the G30S.<ref>{{cite book |last= Hughes |first= John |title= The End of Sukarno: A Coup That Misfired: A Purge That Ran Wild |origyear= 1967 |edition= 3rd |year= 2002 |publisher= Archipelago Press |location= Singapore |isbn=981-4068-65-9 |pages= 290}}</ref> The Special Session now turned on the matter of the presidency. Such was the intensive debate surrounding this matter that the Special Session did not finish on 11 March 1967 as intended but had to go for another extra day. But when the decision was finally made, it was unanimous. On 12 March 1967, the MPRS agreed to withdrew its mandate from Soekarno and remove him as president. Replacing Soekarno, in the capacity of acting president (''Pejabat Presiden'') would be Soeharto.\n\n==Cabinet==\nSuharto retained the [[Ampera Cabinet]] which had been formed by him in July 1966. He reshuffled this Cabinet in October 1967 and created the [[Revised Ampera Cabinet]].\n\n==Home affairs==\n\n===Legislative elections===\nThe 1966 MPRS General Session passed a resolution calling for legislative elections to be held no later than 5 July 1968<ref>{{cite book |last= Elson |first= Robert |title= Suharto: A Political Biography   |year= 2001 |pages= 144}}</ref> and this became one of the first matters that Suharto attempted to address during his acting presidency. In doing this, he would have to deal with political parties.<ref>The political parties were the Indonesian National Party (PNI), NU, the Indonesian Islamic Union Party (PSII), the Islamic Educational Movement (Perti), the Indonesian Christian Party (Parkindo), the Catholic Party, the Indonesian Independence Supporters\u2019 Union (IPKI), [[Murba Party]], and the Joint Secretariat of the Functional Groups (Sekber Golkar)</ref>\n\nFor the political parties, the main point of contention was whether the Legislative Election would use the [[Single-member constituency|district system]] or [[proportional representation]].<ref>{{cite book |last= Notosusanto |first= Nugroho |authorlink=Nugroho Notosusanto|title= Tercapainya Konsensus Nasional: 1966-1969 |year= 1985 |publisher= [[Balai Pustaka]] |location= Jakarta |language= Indonesian |pages= 49}}</ref> In the previous year, [[Military of Indonesia|ABRI]] had expressed interest in the district system and as such handed to the DPR an election bill which favors the district system. The bill was successfully blocked in the DPR as the list of parties not wanting change to the district system included the [[Indonesian National Party]] (PNI) and [[Nadhlatul Ulama]] (NU). With time running out until the 1968 Legislative Elections, Suharto needed to hammer out a compromise.\n\nSuharto held a series of meetings during the first three months of his acting presidency with the leadership of the political parties. To accommodate the political parties, Suharto backed out of the notion of a district system and began supporting proportional representation; the trade-off being that the Government would be able to appoint some of the DPR members.<ref>{{cite book |last= Notosusanto |first= Nugroho  |title= Tercapainya Konsensus Nasional: 1966-1969  |year= 1985 |pages= 49}}</ref> The breakthrough was made on 25 July 1967 when the political parties agreed that the Legislative Elections will be held using proportional representation, that the Government will appoint 100 MPs out of the 460 in the DPR, and that the Government will appoint 1/3 of the deputies of the new People's Consultative Assembly (MPR).\n\nDespite the breakthrough it quickly became clear that it would be difficult to meet the deadline set by the MPRS. The bill would have to be rewritten and would have to go through the proper procedures before it could be passed. The bill was resubmitted to the DPR on 16 December 1967 but by January 1968, Suharto reported to the Chairman and Vice-Chairmen of the MPRS that it would be impossible to hold a Legislative Election in 1968.<ref>{{cite book |last= Elson |first= Robert  |title= Suharto: A Political Biography  |year= 2001 |pages= 164}}</ref>\n\n===Dealing with Sukarno===\nThe MPRS Resolution which appointed Suharto to the acting presidency also gave him the power to take legal action against Sukarno. Suharto chose not to take any legal action and instead, Sukarno was still allowed to reside at the Presidential Palace and enjoy his freedom. Suharto also continued to insist that Sukarno was still the Head of State. Speaking on 13 March 1967, Suharto insisted that Sukarno was still President and Head of State, although without the political power that came with the office. This state of affairs did not last long. By May, Suharto decided that Sukarno was no longer allowed to use the title of President of the Republic of Indonesia and placed the former President under house arrest at [[Bogor]] Palace.<ref>{{cite book |last= Elson |first= Robert  |title= Suharto: A Political Biography  |year= 2001 |pages= 157\u2013159}}</ref>\n\n===Other===\nDuring the course of 1967, Suharto confirmed that [[West Papua (region)|West Papua]] would be given a [[plebiscite]] concerning the matter of integration with Indonesia.<ref>{{cite book |last= Elson |first= Robert  |title= Suharto: A Political Biography  |year= 2001 |pages= 178}}</ref>\n\nOn 12 September 1967, he signed a bill into a law which approved the formation of [[Bengkulu]] Province<ref>{{cite news\n |author=Suharto \n |url=http://www.unmit.org/legal/IndonesianLaw/uu/Uu196709.htm \n |title=UU 9/1967, PEMBENTUKAN PROPINSI BENGKULU \n |publisher=UN Mission in Timor \n |date=12 September 1967 \n |accessdate=2007-11-25 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116103451/http://www.unmit.org/legal/IndonesianLaw/uu/Uu196709.htm \n |archivedate=16 November 2007 \n |url-status=live \n |df=dmy \n}}</ref>\n\n==Foreign Affairs==\nThe idea of pooling together the nations of [[South-East Asia]] into one organization came from [[Thanat Khoman]] the [[Thailand|Thai]] Minister of Foreign Affairs.<ref>{{cite news\n |last=Khoman \n |first=Thanat \n |url=http://www.asean.org/thanat.htm \n |title=ASEAN Conception and Evolution \n |publisher=ASEAN Website \n |accessdate=2007-11-25 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110411045814/http://www.asean.org/thanat.htm \n |archivedate=11 April 2011 \n}}</ref> He suggested the idea to Indonesia's Minister of Foreign Affairs, [[Adam Malik]] who promised to bring it up with Suharto. Suharto was interested in the idea and sent Malik to a conference in Thailand in August 1967. The conference was also attended by the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], and [[Philippines]]. On 8 August 1967, the five Ministers signed the [[ASEAN Declaration|Bangkok Declaration]] which marked the formation of the [[Association of South East Asian Nations]] (ASEAN). The declaration called among other things for the cooperation to help accelerate economic growth and promote stability in the region.<ref>{{cite news\n |author=Adam Malik \n |author2=S.

The perception of the Indonesian Government was that China had backed the [[Indonesian Communist Party]] (PKI). The deterioration was not helped by the fact that the response to Indonesia's suspicion was the ideological zeal of China's [[Cultural Revolution]]. In October 1967, Indonesia announced that it was freezing diplomatic relations with China.<ref>{{cite book |last= Elson |first= Robert  |title= Suharto: A Political Biography  |year= 2001 |pages= 162}}</ref>\n\nThe emergence of Suharto as acting president was well received by the [[West]], who was keen to not only invest but give aid. Relationship with the [[Soviet Bloc]] cooled down but nevertheless, Suharto would work towards repaying the debt incurred during the Sukarno Government. More details can be seen later in this article.\n\n==Defense and Security==\nThe first order of business for Suharto was to give official recognition to the non-military mission and roles of the [[Indonesian National Armed Forces|Armed Forces of the Republic of Indonesia (ABRI)]] as Commander in Chief and Minister of Defense. Measures had been taken to create a doctrinal justification for the ABRI's interference in non-military matters and this had culminated in August 1966 with the formulation of the Four Duties, One Function (Indonesian: ''Catur Dharma Eka Karya'' Acronym: Cadek) Doctrine. The doctrine stated that in addition to its defense and security role, the ABRI will also take part and would serve in other fields outside of the aforementioned functions of defense and security, including politics, culture, education and economy.<ref>{{cite book |last= Moertopo |first= Ali |title= Strategi Pembangunan Nasional |year= 1981 |publisher= CSIS |location= Jakarta |language= Indonesian |pages= 249}}</ref> 31 March 1967, Suharto called on the ABRI to adopt and implement the Cadek Doctrine.\n\nThe next step was to continue purging the armed forces and police of PKI and Sukarnoist elements. With the Army, most intense purges happened in [[Central Java]], [[East Java]], and [[North Sumatra]] with the Commanders of the 1st, 4th and 5th Regional Military Commands (Kodam) supervising the areas in question leading the purge.<ref>{{cite book |last= Crouch |first= Harold |authorlink=Harold Crouch|title= The Army and Politics in Indonesia |year= 1978 |publisher= Cornell University Press |location= London |pages= 233\u2013234}}</ref> Outside of the Army, the Air Force had been weakened enough by its alleged involvement with G30S. The National Police tried to resist but political pressure became too strong for them to overcome.  Only the Navy resisted, criticizing the purges as practice reminiscent of the Old Order.\n\nSuharto also began reorganizing the Command Structure of the ABRI. The first step was taken by stripping the Commanders of the Army, Navy, Air Force and Police of their Cabinet rank and Ministries (the Army, Navy, Air and Police Ministries, which fused into the Ministry of Defense and Public Security) in August 1967, leaving only the Minister of Defense and Security and the Commander of the Armed Forces of the Republic with Cabinet memberships.<ref>{{cite book |last= Elson |first= Robert |title= Suharto: A Political Biography  |year= 2001 |pages= 182}}</ref> Suharto's acting presidency also saw the establishment of the State Intelligence Coordinating Agency (BAKIN),<ref>{{cite news\n |last=Sudiati \n |first=Wiwik \n |url=http://www.ruangbaca.com/ruangbaca/?doky=MjAwNw==&dokm=MDU=&dokd=MzA=&dig=YXJjaGl2ZXM=&on=VUxT&uniq=NDkx \n |title=Napas Tilak Dunia Intelijen Indonesia \n |publisher=Koran Tempo \n |date=2007-05-30 \n |accessdate=2007-11-26 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209064813/http://www.ruangbaca.com/ruangbaca/?doky=MjAwNw%3D%3D&dokm=MDU%3D&dokd=MzA%3D&dig=YXJjaGl2ZXM%3D&on=VUxT&uniq=NDkx \n |archivedate=9 December 2007 \n}}</ref> another agency to ensure state security in addition to the Operational Command for the Restoration of Security and Order ([[Kopkamtib]]), whose commander was also a part of the cabinet.

The second method is the non-individual tax counting (''menghitung pajak orang lain'') method.

The new law placed cooperatives back as a purely economic institution and to undo the previous cooperatives law, does not approve of discrimination based on political beliefs amongst its leadership. The new law also called for the Government to guide, assist, supervise and protect cooperatives in its policies.

He reshuffled this Cabinet in October 1967 and created the [[Revised Ampera Cabinet]].\n\n==Home affairs==\n\n===Legislative elections===\nThe 1966 MPRS General Session passed a resolution calling for legislative elections to be held no later than 5 July 1968<ref>{{cite book |last= Elson |first= Robert |title= Suharto: A Political Biography   |year= 2001 |pages= 144}}</ref> and this became one of the first matters that Suharto attempted to address during his acting presidency. In doing this, he would have to deal with political parties.<ref>The political parties were the Indonesian National Party (PNI), NU, the Indonesian Islamic Union Party (PSII), the Islamic Educational Movement (Perti), the Indonesian Christian Party (Parkindo), the Catholic Party, the Indonesian Independence Supporters\u2019 Union (IPKI), [[Murba Party]], and the Joint Secretariat of the Functional Groups (Sekber Golkar)</ref>\n\nFor the political parties, the main point of contention was whether the Legislative Election would use the [[Single-member constituency|district system]] or [[proportional representation]].<ref>{{cite book |last= Notosusanto |first= Nugroho |authorlink=Nugroho Notosusanto|title= Tercapainya Konsensus Nasional: 1966-1969 |year= 1985 |publisher= [[Balai Pustaka]] |location= Jakarta |language= Indonesian |pages= 49}}</ref> In the previous year, [[Military of Indonesia|ABRI]] had expressed interest in the district system and as such handed to the DPR an election bill which favors the district system. The bill was successfully blocked in the DPR as the list of parties not wanting change to the district system included the [[Indonesian National Party]] (PNI) and [[Nadhlatul Ulama]] (NU). With time running out until the 1968 Legislative Elections, Suharto needed to hammer out a compromise.\n\nSuharto held a series of meetings during the first three months of his acting presidency with the leadership of the political parties. To accommodate the political parties, Suharto backed out of the notion of a district system and began supporting proportional representation; the trade-off being that the Government would be able to appoint some of the DPR members.<ref>{{cite book |last= Notosusanto |first= Nugroho  |title= Tercapainya Konsensus Nasional: 1966-1969  |year= 1985 |pages= 49}}</ref> The breakthrough was made on 25 July 1967 when the political parties agreed that the Legislative Elections will be held using proportional representation, that the Government will appoint 100 MPs out of the 460 in the DPR, and that the Government will appoint 1/3 of the deputies of the new People's Consultative Assembly (MPR).\n\nDespite the breakthrough it quickly became clear that it would be difficult to meet the deadline set by the MPRS. The bill would have to be rewritten and would have to go through the proper procedures before it could be passed. The bill was resubmitted to the DPR on 16 December 1967 but by January 1968, Suharto reported to the Chairman and Vice-Chairmen of the MPRS that it would be impossible to hold a Legislative Election in 1968.<ref>{{cite book |last= Elson |first= Robert  |title= Suharto: A Political Biography  |year= 2001 |pages= 164}}</ref>\n\n===Dealing with Sukarno===\nThe MPRS Resolution which appointed Suharto to the acting presidency also gave him the power to take legal action against Sukarno. Suharto chose not to take any legal action and instead, Sukarno was still allowed to reside at the Presidential Palace and enjoy his freedom. Suharto also continued to insist that Sukarno was still the Head of State. Speaking on 13 March 1967, Suharto insisted that Sukarno was still President and Head of State, although without the political power that came with the office. This state of affairs did not last long. By May, Suharto decided that Sukarno was no longer allowed to use the title of President of the Republic of Indonesia and placed the former President under house arrest at [[Bogor]] Palace.<ref>{{cite book |last= Elson |first= Robert  |title= Suharto: A Political Biography  |year= 2001 |pages= 157\u2013159}}</ref>\n\n===Other===\nDuring the course of 1967, Suharto confirmed that [[West Papua (region)|West Papua]] would be given a [[plebiscite]] concerning the matter of integration with Indonesia.<ref>{{cite book |last= Elson |first= Robert  |title= Suharto: A Political Biography  |year= 2001 |pages= 178}}</ref>\n\nOn 12 September 1967, he signed a bill into a law which approved the formation of [[Bengkulu]] Province<ref>{{cite news\n |author=Suharto \n |url=http://www.unmit.org/legal/IndonesianLaw/uu/Uu196709.htm \n |title=UU 9/1967, PEMBENTUKAN PROPINSI BENGKULU \n |publisher=UN Mission in Timor \n |date=12 September 1967 \n |accessdate=2007-11-25 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116103451/http://www.unmit.org/legal/IndonesianLaw/uu/Uu196709.htm \n |archivedate=16 November 2007 \n |url-status=live \n |df=dmy \n}}</ref>\n\n==Foreign Affairs==\nThe idea of pooling together the nations of [[South-East Asia]] into one organization came from [[Thanat Khoman]] the [[Thailand|Thai]] Minister of Foreign Affairs.<ref>{{cite news\n |last=Khoman \n |first=Thanat \n |url=http://www.asean.org/thanat.htm \n |title=ASEAN Conception and Evolution \n |publisher=ASEAN Website \n |accessdate=2007-11-25 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110411045814/http://www.asean.org/thanat.htm \n |archivedate=11 April 2011 \n}}</ref> He suggested the idea to Indonesia's Minister of Foreign Affairs, [[Adam Malik]] who promised to bring it up with Suharto. Suharto was interested in the idea and sent Malik to a conference in Thailand in August 1967. The conference was also attended by the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], and [[Philippines]]. On 8 August 1967, the five Ministers signed the [[ASEAN Declaration|Bangkok Declaration]] which marked the formation of the [[Association of South East Asian Nations]] (ASEAN). The declaration called among other things for the cooperation to help accelerate economic growth and promote stability in the region.<ref>{{cite news\n |author=Adam Malik \n |author2=S.

The perception of the Indonesian Government was that China had backed the [[Indonesian Communist Party]] (PKI). The deterioration was not helped by the fact that the response to Indonesia's suspicion was the ideological zeal of China's [[Cultural Revolution]]. In October 1967, Indonesia announced that it was freezing diplomatic relations with China.<ref>{{cite book |last= Elson |first= Robert  |title= Suharto: A Political Biography  |year= 2001 |pages= 162}}</ref>\n\nThe emergence of Suharto as acting president was well received by the [[West]], who was keen to not only invest but give aid. Relationship with the [[Soviet Bloc]] cooled down but nevertheless, Suharto would work towards repaying the debt incurred during the Sukarno Government. More details can be seen later in this article.\n\n==Defense and Security==\nThe first order of business for Suharto was to give official recognition to the non-military mission and roles of the [[Indonesian National Armed Forces|Armed Forces of the Republic of Indonesia (ABRI)]] as Commander in Chief and Minister of Defense. Measures had been taken to create a doctrinal justification for the ABRI's interference in non-military matters and this had culminated in August 1966 with the formulation of the Four Duties, One Function (Indonesian: ''Catur Dharma Eka Karya'' Acronym: Cadek) Doctrine. The doctrine stated that in addition to its defense and security role, the ABRI will also take part and would serve in other fields outside of the aforementioned functions of defense and security, including politics, culture, education and economy.<ref>{{cite book |last= Moertopo |first= Ali |title= Strategi Pembangunan Nasional |year= 1981 |publisher= CSIS |location= Jakarta |language= Indonesian |pages= 249}}</ref> 31 March 1967, Suharto called on the ABRI to adopt and implement the Cadek Doctrine.\n\nThe next step was to continue purging the armed forces and police of PKI and Sukarnoist elements. With the Army, most intense purges happened in [[Central Java]], [[East Java]], and [[North Sumatra]] with the Commanders of the 1st, 4th and 5th Regional Military Commands (Kodam) supervising the areas in question leading the purge.<ref>{{cite book |last= Crouch |first= Harold |authorlink=Harold Crouch|title= The Army and Politics in Indonesia |year= 1978 |publisher= Cornell University Press |location= London |pages= 233\u2013234}}</ref> Outside of the Army, the Air Force had been weakened enough by its alleged involvement with G30S. The National Police tried to resist but political pressure became too strong for them to overcome.  Only the Navy resisted, criticizing the purges as practice reminiscent of the Old Order.\n\nSuharto also began reorganizing the Command Structure of the ABRI. The first step was taken by stripping the Commanders of the Army, Navy, Air Force and Police of their Cabinet rank and Ministries (the Army, Navy, Air and Police Ministries, which fused into the Ministry of Defense and Public Security) in August 1967, leaving only the Minister of Defense and Security and the Commander of the Armed Forces of the Republic with Cabinet memberships.<ref>{{cite book |last= Elson |first= Robert |title= Suharto: A Political Biography  |year= 2001 |pages= 182}}</ref> Suharto's acting presidency also saw the establishment of the State Intelligence Coordinating Agency (BAKIN),<ref>{{cite news\n |last=Sudiati \n |first=Wiwik \n |url=http://www.ruangbaca.com/ruangbaca/?doky=MjAwNw==&dokm=MDU=&dokd=MzA=&dig=YXJjaGl2ZXM=&on=VUxT&uniq=NDkx \n |title=Napas Tilak Dunia Intelijen Indonesia \n |publisher=Koran Tempo \n |date=2007-05-30 \n |accessdate=2007-11-26 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209064813/http://www.ruangbaca.com/ruangbaca/?doky=MjAwNw%3D%3D&dokm=MDU%3D&dokd=MzA%3D&dig=YXJjaGl2ZXM%3D&on=VUxT&uniq=NDkx \n |archivedate=9 December 2007 \n}}</ref> another agency to ensure state security in addition to the Operational Command for the Restoration of Security and Order ([[Kopkamtib]]), whose commander was also a part of the cabinet.

The second method is the non-individual tax counting (''menghitung pajak orang lain'') method. In this method an individual was appointed by the Head of the Tax Inspection to count and pay the taxes of other individuals.

Nevertheless, instead of sending its supply of rice to the market, Bulog focused instead on distributing rice to members of ABRI and the [[civil service]]. With high demand and no step being taken on the supply side, the price of rice had nowhere to go but up, its high price causing discontent within the population towards the end of the year.\n\nOn 8 July 1967, the DPR passed the Guidelines for [[Animal Husbandry]] and Health Law.<ref>{{cite news\n |author=Suharto \n |url=http://www.unmit.org/legal/IndonesianLaw/uu/Uu196706.htm \n |title=UU 6/1967, KETENTUAN KETENTUAN POKOK PETERNAKAN DAN KESEHATAN HEWAN \n |publisher=UN Mission in Timor \n |date=8 July 1967 \n |accessdate=2007-11-26 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116103434/http://www.unmit.org/legal/IndonesianLaw/uu/Uu196706.htm \n |archivedate=16 November 2007 \n |url-status=live \n |df=dmy \n}}</ref> The law called for setting aside land to grow animal food and for vaccination against animal diseases as well as categorizing the different kinds of Farming Enterprises and calling on the Government to invest capital in animal husbandry.\n\n===Trade===\nIn July 1967, the Government simplified [[export]] [[import]] procedures in addition to taking a step back and giving as well as assisting the private sector an opportunity to conduct trade.<ref>{{cite news\n |author=Suharto \n |url=http://www.unmit.org/legal/IndonesianLaw/pp/Pp196710.htm \n |title=PP 10/1967, PENYEDERHANAAN PROSEDUR EKSPOR DAN IMPOR \n |publisher=UN Mission in Timor \n |date=28 July 1967 \n |accessdate=2007-11-26 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228151120/http://www.unmit.org/legal/IndonesianLaw/pp/Pp196710.htm \n |archivedate=28 February 2008 \n |url-status=live \n |df=dmy \n}}</ref><ref name=\"http\">{{cite news \n |author = Bappenas\n |url = http://www.bappenas.go.id/index.php?module=Filemanager&func=download&pathext=ContentExpress/&view=418/Bab-04-P-J-1973%20cek.doc.\n |title =  Lampiran Pidato Pertanggungjawaban Presiden 1968 s.d. 1973 Bab IV: Neraca Pembayaran dan Perdagangan Luar Negeri\n |publisher = Bappenas\n |date = 1973-03-12\n |accessdate = 2007-11-26\n}}</ref>  For the year 1967, Indonesia was able to earn $770 million from its exports although it would spend $805 million from its imports and thus, running a trade deficit.\n\nIn earning $770 million from exports, $244 million was earned from exporting [[petroleum]] whilst $526 million was earned from non-petroleum exports.

The new law placed cooperatives back as a purely economic institution and to undo the previous cooperatives law, does not approve of discrimination based on political beliefs amongst its leadership.
