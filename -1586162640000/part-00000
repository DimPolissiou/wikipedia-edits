The base-satellite contains the sub-satellite and tether until deployment. Sometimes the base-satellite is another basic satellite, other times it could be a spacecraft, space station, or the Moon. The tether is what keeps the two satellites connected. The sub-satellite is released from the base assisted by a spring ejection system, centrifugal force or gravity gradient effects.\n\nTethers can be deployed for a range of applications, including electrodynamic propulsion, momentum exchange, artificial gravity, deployment of sensors or antennas etc. Tether deployment may be followed by a station-keeping phase (in particular if the target state is a vertical system orientation), and, sometimes, if the deployment system allows, a retraction.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\nThe station-keeping phase and retraction phase need active control for stability, especially when atmospheric effects are taken into account. When there are no simplifying assumptions, the dynamics become overly difficult because they are then governed by a set of ordinary and partial nonlinear, non-autonomous and coupled [[differential equation]]s. These conditions create a list of dynamical issues to consider:<ref name=\"handbook\">NASA, [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19980018321_1998056794.pdf Tethers In Space Handbook], edited by M.L.

It was a joint NASA-[[Italian Space Agency]] project, was flown in 1992, during [[STS-46]] aboard the [[Space Shuttle Atlantis]] from 31 July to 8 August.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Dobrowolny, M., Stone, N.H.|title=A technical overview of TSS-1: The first Tethered-Satellite system mission|journal=Il Nuovo Cimento C|volume=17|issue=1|pages=1\u201312|year=1994|doi=10.1007/BF02506678 |bibcode=1994NCimC..17....1D}}</ref>\n\nThe purposes of the TSS-1 mission were to verify the tether concept of gravity gradient stabilization, and to provide a research facility for investigating space physics and plasma electrodynamics. This mission uncovered several aspects about the dynamics of the tethered system, although the satellite did not fully deploy. It stuck at 78 meters; after that snag was resolved its deployment continued to a length of 256 meters before sticking again, where the effort finally ended<ref>''Heart Breaker'', [[Air & Space/Smithsonian]], June/July 1996, pp. 18-23</ref> (the total proposed length was 20,000 meters). A protruding bolt<ref>NASA Science Missions page [https://science.nasa.gov/missions/tss/ TSS Tethered Satellite System] (accessed 10 October 2010)</ref> due to a late-stage modification of the deployment reel system, jammed the deployment mechanism and prevented deployment to full extension. Despite this issue, the results showed that the basic concept of long gravity-gradient stabilized tethers was sound. It also settled several short deployment dynamics issues, reduced safety concerns, and clearly demonstrated the feasibility of deploying the satellite to long distances.<ref name=\"handbook\"/>\n\nThe voltage and current reached using the short tether length were too low for most of the experiments to be run. However, low-voltage measurements were made, along with recording the variations of tether-induced forces and currents. New information was gathered on the \"return-tether\" current. The mission was reflown in 1996 as TSS-1R.<ref name=\"GSFC\">[http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/wtether.html The Space Tether Experiment]</ref>\n\n==== TSS-1R mission ====\nFour years later, as a follow-up mission to TSS-1, the TSS-1R satellite was released in latter February 1996 from the [[Space Shuttle Columbia]] on the [[STS-75]] mission.<ref name=\"GSFC\"/> The TSS-1R mission objective was to deploy the tether 20.7&nbsp;km above the orbiter and remain there collecting data. The TSS-1R mission was to conduct exploratory experiments in space plasma physics. Projections indicated that the motion of the long conducting tether through the Earth\u2019s magnetic field would produce an EMF that would drive a current through the tether system.\n\nTSS-1R was deployed to 19.7&nbsp;km when the tether broke.

Most notably, tethers are used in the \"[[yo-yo de-spin]]\" mechanism, often used in systems where a probe set spinning during a [[solid rocket]] injection motor firing, but needs the spin removed during flight.<ref>Kenneth S. Bush, \"The Yo-Yo Despin Mechanism,\" presented at the ''Second Aerospace Mechanisms Symposium'', San Francisco CA, 4\u20135 May 1967; NASA TM-X-60068 ([https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19680018324_1968018324.pdf pdf version], accessed 16 February 2012)</ref> In this mechanism, weights on the end of long cables are deployed away from the body of the spinning satellite. When the cables are cut, much or all of the [[angular momentum]] of the spin is transferred to the discarded weights.  As an example, the [[Dawn Mission]] utilized two 3&nbsp;kg of weights deployed on 12 meter cables.<ref>[http://dawn.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/journal_9_12_07.asp Dawn Journal, 12 September 2007]</ref>\n\n===NASA Small Expendable Deployer System Experiments===\nIn 1993 and 1994, NASA launched three missions using the \"Small Expendable Deployer System\" (SEDS), which deployed 20&nbsp;km (SEDS and SEDS II) and 500-meter (PMG) tethers attached to a spent [[Delta II|Delta-II]] second stage. The three experiments were the first successful flights of long tethers in orbit, and demonstrated both mechanical and electrodynamic tether operation.\n\n====SEDS I====\nThe first fully successful orbital flight test of a long tether system was SEDS-1, which tested the simple deploy-only Small Expendable Deployer System. The tether swung to the vertical and was cut after one orbit. This slung the payload and tether from Guam onto a reentry trajectory off the coast of Mexico. The reentry was accurate enough that a pre-positioned observer was able to videotape the payload re-entry and burnup.<ref name=\"carroll\">Joseph A. Carroll and John C. Oldson, \"[http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2532&context=smallsat Tethers for Small Satellite Applications]\", presented at the ''1995 AIAA/USU Small Satellite Conference'' in Logan, Utah (accessed 20 October 2010)</ref>\n\n====SEDS II====\nSEDS-2 was launched on a [[Delta (rocket family)|Delta]] (along with a GPS Block 2 satellite) on 9 March 1994. A feedback braking limited the swing after deployment to 4\u00b0. The payload returned data for 8 hours until its battery died; during this time tether torque spun it up to 4 rpm. The tether suffered a cut 3.7 days after deployment. The payload reentered (as expected) within hours, but the 7.2&nbsp;km length at the Delta end survived with no further cuts until re-entry on 7 May 1994. The tether was an easy naked eye object when lit by the sun and viewed against a dark sky.<ref name=\"carroll\"/>\n\nIn these experiments, tether models were verified, and the tests demonstrated that a reentry vehicle can be downwardly deployed into a reentry orbit using tethers.<ref name=\"darling\"/>\n\n====PMG====\nA follow-on experiment, the Plasma Motor Generator (PMG), used the SEDS deployer to deploy a 500-m tether to demonstrate electrodynamic tether operation.<ref name=\"carroll\"/><ref name=\"darling\">David Darling, Internet Encyclopedia of Science, [http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/S/SEDS.html SEDS] (accessed 20 October 2010)</ref>\n\nThe PMG was planned to test the ability of a [[Hollow cathode effect|Hollow Cathode]] Assembly (HCA) to provide a low\u2013impedance bipolar electric current between a spacecraft and the ionosphere. In addition, other expectations were to show that the mission configuration could function as an orbit-boosting motor as well as a generator, by converting orbital energy into electricity. The tether was a 500 m length of insulated 18 gauge copper wire.<ref name=\"carroll\"/>\nThe mission was launched on 26 June 1993, as the secondary payload on a Delta II rocket. The total experiment lasted approximately seven hours. In that time, the results demonstrated that current is fully reversible, and therefore was capable of generating power and orbit boosting modes. The hollow cathode was able to provide a low\u2013power way of connecting the current to and from the ambient plasma. This means that the HC demonstrated its electron collection and emission capabilities.<ref>Grossi, Mario D., [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19960002041 Plasma Motor Generator (PMG) electrodynamic tether experiment], Report NASA-CR-199523, Jun 1, 1995 (papers presented at Fourth International Space Conference on Tethers in Space, Washington, DC, April 1995).

The two tethered objects were called \"Ralph\" and \"Norton\". TiPS was visible from the ground with binoculars or a telescope and was occasionally accidentally spotted by amateur astronomers. The tether broke in July 2006.<ref name=\"satobs.org\">{{Cite web | url=http://www.satobs.org/noss.html |title = NOSS Double and Triple Satellite Formations}}</ref> This long-term statistical data point is in line with debris models published by J. Carroll after the SEDS-2 mission, and ground tests by D. Sabath from TU Muenchen. Predictions of a maximum of two years survivability for TiPS based on some other ground tests have shown to be overly pessimistic (e.g. McBride/Taylor, Penson). The early cut of the SEDS-2 therewith must be considered an anomaly possibly related to the impact of upper stage debris.<ref name=\"satobs.org\"/>\n\n==== ATEx ====\nThe Advanced Tether Experiment (ATEx), was a follow on to the TiPS experiment, designed and built by the Naval Center for Space Technology. ATEx flew as part of the [[STEX]] (Space Technology Experiment) mission.  ATEx had two end masses connected by a polyethylene tether that was intended to deploy to a length of 6&nbsp;km in length, and was intended to test a new tether deployment scheme, new tether material, active control, and survivability. ATEx was deployed on 16 January 1999 and ended 18 minutes later after deploying only 22 m of tether. The jettison was triggered by an automatic protection system designed to save STEX if the tether began to stray from its expected departure angle,<ref>U. S.

T-Rex was developed by an international team led by the Kanagawa Institute of Technology/Nihon University to test a new type of electrodynamic tether (EDT).

The base-satellite contains the sub-satellite and tether until deployment. Sometimes the base-satellite is another basic satellite, other times it could be a spacecraft, space station, or the Moon. The tether is what keeps the two satellites connected. The sub-satellite is released from the base assisted by a spring ejection system, centrifugal force or gravity gradient effects.\n\nTethers can be deployed for a range of applications, including electrodynamic propulsion, momentum exchange, artificial gravity, deployment of sensors or antennas etc. Tether deployment may be followed by a station-keeping phase (in particular if the target state is a vertical system orientation), and, sometimes, if the deployment system allows, a retraction.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\nThe station-keeping phase and retraction phase need active control for stability, especially when atmospheric effects are taken into account. When there are no simplifying assumptions, the dynamics become overly difficult because they are then governed by a set of ordinary and partial nonlinear, non-autonomous and coupled [[differential equation]]s. These conditions create a list of dynamical issues to consider:<ref name=\"handbook\">NASA, [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19980018321_1998056794.pdf Tethers In Space Handbook], edited by M.L.

It was a joint NASA-[[Italian Space Agency]] project, was flown in 1992, during [[STS-46]] aboard the [[Space Shuttle Atlantis]] from 31 July to 8 August.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Dobrowolny, M., Stone, N.H.|title=A technical overview of TSS-1: The first Tethered-Satellite system mission|journal=Il Nuovo Cimento C|volume=17|issue=1|pages=1\u201312|year=1994|doi=10.1007/BF02506678 |bibcode=1994NCimC..17....1D}}</ref>\n\nThe purposes of the TSS-1 mission were to verify the tether concept of gravity gradient stabilization, and to provide a research facility for investigating space physics and plasma electrodynamics. This mission uncovered several aspects about the dynamics of the tethered system, although the satellite did not fully deploy. It stuck at 78 meters; after that snag was resolved its deployment continued to a length of 256 meters before sticking again, where the effort finally ended<ref>''Heart Breaker'', [[Air & Space/Smithsonian]], June/July 1996, pp. 18-23</ref> (the total proposed length was 20,000 meters). A protruding bolt<ref>NASA Science Missions page [https://science.nasa.gov/missions/tss/ TSS Tethered Satellite System] (accessed 10 October 2010)</ref> due to a late-stage modification of the deployment reel system, jammed the deployment mechanism and prevented deployment to full extension. Despite this issue, the results showed that the basic concept of long gravity-gradient stabilized tethers was sound. It also settled several short deployment dynamics issues, reduced safety concerns, and clearly demonstrated the feasibility of deploying the satellite to long distances.<ref name=\"handbook\"/>\n\nThe voltage and current reached using the short tether length were too low for most of the experiments to be run. However, low-voltage measurements were made, along with recording the variations of tether-induced forces and currents. New information was gathered on the \"return-tether\" current.

The TSS-1R mission was to conduct exploratory experiments in space plasma physics.

Most notably, tethers are used in the \"[[yo-yo de-spin]]\" mechanism, often used in systems where a probe set spinning during a [[solid rocket]] injection motor firing, but needs the spin removed during flight.<ref>Kenneth S. Bush, \"The Yo-Yo Despin Mechanism,\" presented at the ''Second Aerospace Mechanisms Symposium'', San Francisco CA, 4\u20135 May 1967; NASA TM-X-60068 ([https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19680018324_1968018324.pdf pdf version], accessed 16 February 2012)</ref> In this mechanism, weights on the end of long cables are deployed away from the body of the spinning satellite. When the cables are cut, much or all of the [[angular momentum]] of the spin is transferred to the discarded weights.  As an example, the [[Dawn Mission]] utilized two 3&nbsp;kg of weights deployed on 12 meter cables.<ref>[http://dawn.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/journal_9_12_07.asp Dawn Journal, 12 September 2007]</ref>\n\n===NASA Small Expendable Deployer System Experiments===\nIn 1993 and 1994, NASA launched three missions using the \"Small Expendable Deployer System\" (SEDS), which deployed 20&nbsp;km (SEDS and SEDS II) and 500-meter (PMG) tethers attached to a spent [[Delta II|Delta-II]] second stage. The three experiments were the first successful flights of long tethers in orbit, and demonstrated both mechanical and electrodynamic tether operation.\n\n====SEDS I====\nThe first fully successful orbital flight test of a long tether system was SEDS-1, which tested the simple deploy-only Small Expendable Deployer System. The tether swung to the vertical and was cut after one orbit. This slung the payload and tether from Guam onto a reentry trajectory off the coast of Mexico. The reentry was accurate enough that a pre-positioned observer was able to videotape the payload re-entry and burnup.<ref name=\"carroll\">Joseph A. Carroll and John C. Oldson, \"[http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2532&context=smallsat Tethers for Small Satellite Applications]\", presented at the ''1995 AIAA/USU Small Satellite Conference'' in Logan, Utah (accessed 20 October 2010)</ref>\n\n====SEDS II====\nSEDS-2 was launched on a [[Delta (rocket family)|Delta]] (along with a GPS Block 2 satellite) on 9 March 1994. A feedback braking limited the swing after deployment to 4\u00b0. The payload returned data for 8 hours until its battery died; during this time tether torque spun it up to 4 rpm. The tether suffered a cut 3.7 days after deployment. The payload reentered (as expected) within hours, but the 7.2&nbsp;km length at the Delta end survived with no further cuts until re-entry on 7 May 1994. The tether was an easy naked eye object when lit by the sun and viewed against a dark sky.<ref name=\"carroll\"/>\n\nIn these experiments, tether models were verified, and the tests demonstrated that a reentry vehicle can be downwardly deployed into a reentry orbit using tethers.<ref name=\"darling\"/>\n\n====PMG====\nA follow-on experiment, the Plasma Motor Generator (PMG), used the SEDS deployer to deploy a 500-m tether to demonstrate electrodynamic tether operation.<ref name=\"carroll\"/><ref name=\"darling\">David Darling, Internet Encyclopedia of Science, [http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/S/SEDS.html SEDS] (accessed 20 October 2010)</ref>\n\nThe PMG was planned to test the ability of a [[Hollow cathode effect|Hollow Cathode]] Assembly (HCA) to provide a low\u2013impedance bipolar electric current between a spacecraft and the ionosphere. In addition, other expectations were to show that the mission configuration could function as an orbit-boosting motor as well as a generator, by converting orbital energy into electricity. The tether was a 500 m length of insulated 18 gauge copper wire.<ref name=\"carroll\"/>\nThe mission was launched on 26 June 1993, as the secondary payload on a Delta II rocket. The total experiment lasted approximately seven hours. In that time, the results demonstrated that current is fully reversible, and therefore was capable of generating power and orbit boosting modes. The hollow cathode was able to provide a low\u2013power way of connecting the current to and from the ambient plasma. This means that the HC demonstrated its electron collection and emission capabilities.<ref>Grossi, Mario D., [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19960002041 Plasma Motor Generator (PMG) electrodynamic tether experiment], Report NASA-CR-199523, Jun 1, 1995 (papers presented at Fourth International Space Conference on Tethers in Space, Washington, DC, April 1995).

The two tethered objects were called \"Ralph\" and \"Norton\". TiPS was visible from the ground with binoculars or a telescope and was occasionally accidentally spotted by amateur astronomers. The tether broke in July 2006.<ref name=\"satobs.org\">{{Cite web | url=http://www.satobs.org/noss.html |title = NOSS Double and Triple Satellite Formations}}</ref> This long-term statistical data point is in line with debris models published by J. Carroll after the SEDS-2 mission, and ground tests by D. Sabath from TU Muenchen. Predictions of a maximum of two years survivability for TiPS based on some other ground tests have shown to be overly pessimistic (e.g. McBride/Taylor, Penson). The early cut of the SEDS-2 therewith must be considered an anomaly possibly related to the impact of upper stage debris.<ref name=\"satobs.org\"/>\n\n==== ATEx ====\nThe Advanced Tether Experiment (ATEx), was a follow on to the TiPS experiment, designed and built by the Naval Center for Space Technology. ATEx flew as part of the [[STEX]] (Space Technology Experiment) mission.  ATEx had two end masses connected by a polyethylene tether that was intended to deploy to a length of 6&nbsp;km in length, and was intended to test a new tether deployment scheme, new tether material, active control, and survivability. ATEx was deployed on 16 January 1999 and ended 18 minutes later after deploying only 22 m of tether. The jettison was triggered by an automatic protection system designed to save STEX if the tether began to stray from its expected departure angle,<ref>U. S.

This was due to the fact that a fraction of the gas was ionized, which increased the local plasma density, and therefore the level of return current.<ref name=\"Gilchrist, B.E., Banks, P.M., Neubert, T. 1990 2469\u201375\"/>\n\n===OEDIPUS===\nOEDIPUS (\"Observations of Electric-field Distribution in the Ionospheric Plasma&nbsp;\u2014 a Unique Strategy\") consisted of two sounding rocket experiments that used spinning, conductive tethers as a double probe for measurements of weak electric fields in the aurora. They were launched using [[Black Brant (rocket)|Black Brant]] 3-stage sounding rockets. OEDIPUS A launched on 30 January 1989 from [[And\u00f8ya]] in Norway. The tethered payload consisted of two spinning subpayloads with a mass of 84 and 131&nbsp;kg, connected by a spinning tether. The flight established a record for the length of an electrodynamic tether in space at that time: 958 m.<ref name=\"TIS chapter 1\">''Op. cit., Tethers in Space Handbook'', [http://www.dept.aoe.vt.edu/~cdhall/courses/aoe4065/NASADesignSPs/TIS_chap1.pdf Chapter 1]</ref> The tether was a [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|teflon]] coated stranded tin-copper wire of 0.85&nbsp;mm diameter and it was deployed from a spool-type reel located on the forward subpayload.\n\nOEDIPUS C was launched on 6 November 1995 from the [[Poker Flat Research Range]] north of [[Fairbanks, Alaska]] on a Black Brant XII sounding rocket. The flight reached an apogee of 843&nbsp;km and deployed a tether of the same type used in the OEDIPUS-A to a length of 1,174 m. It included a Tether Dynamics Experiment to derive theory and develop simulation and animation software for analyses of multi\u2013body dynamics and control of the spinning tether configuration, provide dynamics and control expertise for the suborbital tethered vehicle and for the science investigations, develop an attitude stabilization scheme for the payloads and support OEDIPUS C payload development, and acquire dynamics data during flight to compare with pre-flight simulation.<ref name=\"TIS chapter 1\"/>\n\n===T-Rex===\nOn 31 August 2010, an experiment by the [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]] (JAXA) on space tether experiment called \"Tether Technologies Rocket Experiment\" (T-REX), sponsored by the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (ISAS/JAXA), was launched on sounding rocket S-520-25 from [[Uchinoura Space Center]], Japan, reaching a maximum altitude of 309&nbsp;km. T-Rex was developed by an international team led by the Kanagawa Institute of Technology/Nihon University to test a new type of electrodynamic tether (EDT). The 300\u2013m tape tether deployed as scheduled and a video of deployment was transmitted to the ground. Successful tether deployment was verified, as was the fast ignition of a hollow cathode in the space environment.<ref>Spaceref, [http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=34856 JAXA's Tether Technologies Rocket Experiment (T-REX) Launched], 4 September 2010 (accessed 16 February 2012)</ref>\n\nThe experiment demonstrated a \"Foldaway Flat Tether Deployment System\". The educational experiment featured the first bare tape tether deployment (''i.e.'' without insulation, the tether itself acts as anode and collects electrons). 130 m of the total of 300 m of tether was deployed fire-hose style, purely driven by inertia and limited by friction, following a powerful, spring-initiated ejection. Accurate differential GPS data of the deployment was recorded, and video taken from the endmasses.<ref>Science at NASA, [https://archive.today/20121213182237/http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2007/11jun_ff.htm?list994055 Tether Origami], 2007 (accessed 16 February 2012)</ref>\n\n==Proposed and future missions==\n\n===ProSEDS===\nThe use of a bare section of a space-borne electrodynamic tether for an electron-collection device has been suggested<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.2514/3.23629|author=Sanmartin, J.R., Martinez-Sanchez, M., Ahedo, E.|title=Bare Wire Anodes for Electrodynamic Tethers|journal=Journal of Propulsion and Power|volume=9|issue=3|pages=353\u2013360|year=1993|bibcode=1993JPP.....9..353S}}</ref> as a promising alternative to end-body electron collectors for certain electrodynamic tether applications. \nThe bare tether concept was to be tested first during NASA\u2019s Propulsive Small Expendable Deployer System (ProSEDS) mission.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Johnson, L., Estes, R.D., Lorenzini, E.C.|title=Propulsive Small Expendable Deployer System Experiment|journal=JSR|volume=37|issue=2|pages=173\u20136|year=2000|doi=10.2514/2.3563|bibcode=2000JSpRo..37..173J|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/96de767dbb3d3cf14fc5422e774aed4c081549f8}}</ref> While the mission was canceled<ref>{{cite conference|author=Vaughn, J.A., Curtis, L., Gilchrist, B.E.|title=Review of the ProSEDS Electrodynamic Tether Mission Development|year=2004|conference=40th AIAA/ASME/SAE/ASEE Joint Propulsion Conference and Exhibit|publisher=AIAA|pages=1\u201312}}</ref> after NASA's space shuttle Columbia accident, the concept could potentially be undertaken in the future.<ref>{{cite conference|author=Fuhrhop, K.R., Gilchrist, B.E., Bilen, S.G.|title=System Analysis of the Expected Electrodynamic Tether Performance for the ProSEDS Mission|year=2003|conference=39th AIAA/ASME/SAE/ASEE Joint Propulsion Conference|publisher=AIAA|pages=1\u201310}}; {{cite conference|author=Lorenzini, E.C., Welzyn, K., Cosmo, M.L.|title=Expected Deployment Dynamics of ProSEDS|year=2003|conference=39th AIAA/ASME/SAE/ASEE Joint Propulsion Conference|publisher=AIAA|pages=1\u20139}}; {{cite conference|author=Sanmartin, J.R., Charro, M., Lorenzini, E.C.|title=Analysis of ProSEDS Test of Bare-tether Collection|year=2003|conference=39th AIAA/ASME/SAE/ASEE Joint Propulsion Conference|publisher=AIAA|pages=1\u20137}}</ref>\n\n===STARS-C===\n\nA follow-on to the earlier STARS and STARS-II satellites, STARS-C (Space Tethered Autonomous Robotic Satellite-Cube) is to be launched from the [[International Space Station]].

While he spent most of his life in the monastery, Bede travelled to several abbeys and monasteries across the British Isles, even visiting the archbishop of York and King Ceolwulf of Northumbria. \n\nHe is well known as an author, teacher (a student of one of his pupils was [[Alcuin]]), and scholar, and his most famous work, ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'', gained him the title \"The Father of [[History of England|English History]]\". His ecumenical writings were extensive and included a number of Biblical commentaries and other theological works of exegetical erudition. Another important area of study for Bede was the academic discipline of ''computus'', otherwise known to his contemporaries as the science of calculating calendar dates. One of the more important dates Bede tried to compute was Easter, an effort that was mired in controversy. He also helped establish the practice of dating forward from the birth of Christ (''[[Anno Domini]]'' \u2013 in the year of our Lord), a practice which eventually became commonplace in medieval Europe. Bede was one of the greatest teachers and writers of the [[Early Middle Ages]] and is considered by many historians to be the single most important scholar of antiquity for the period between the death of [[Pope Gregory I]] in 604 and the coronation of [[Charlemagne]] in 800.\n\nIn 1899, [[Pope Leo XIII]] declared him a [[Doctor of the Church]]. He is the only native of [[Great Britain]] to achieve this designation; [[Anselm of Canterbury]], also a Doctor of the Church, was originally from Italy. Bede was moreover a skilled linguist and translator, and his work made the [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] writings of the early [[Church Fathers]] much more accessible to his fellow [[Anglo-Saxons]], which contributed significantly to English [[Christianity]]. Bede's monastery had access to an impressive library which included works by [[Eusebius]], [[Orosius]], and many others.\n\n== Life ==\n[[File:Opera Bedae Venerabilis.tif|thumb|''Opera Bedae Venerabilis'' (1563)]]\nAlmost everything that is known of Bede's life is contained in the last chapter of his ''Ecclesiastical History of the English People'', a history of the church in England.

The ''Liber Vitae'' of [[Durham Cathedral]] names two priests with this name, one of whom is presumably Bede himself.

The ''Life of Ceolfrith'', written in about 710, records that only two surviving monks were capable of singing the full offices; one was Ceolfrith and the other a young boy, who according to the anonymous writer had been taught by Ceolfrith. The two managed to do the entire service of the liturgy until others could be trained. The young boy was almost certainly Bede, who would have been about 14.<ref name=World178/><ref name=Plummer_I_xii>Plummer, ''Bedae Opera Historica'', vol.

According to Cuthbert, Bede fell ill, \"with frequent attacks of breathlessness but almost without pain\", before Easter. On the Tuesday, two days before Bede died, his breathing became worse and his feet swelled. He continued to dictate to a scribe, however, and despite spending the night awake in prayer he dictated again the following day. At three o'clock, according to Cuthbert, he asked for a box of his to be brought, and distributed among the priests of the monastery \"a few treasures\" of his: \"some pepper, and napkins, and some incense\". That night he dictated a final sentence to the scribe, a boy named Wilberht, and died soon afterwards.<ref name=\"ColgraveMynors1969pp580-587\">{{harvnb|Colgrave|Mynors|1969|pp=580\u2013587}}</ref> The account of Cuthbert does not make entirely clear whether Bede died before midnight or after.

Albinus, the abbot of the monastery in Canterbury, provided much information about the church in Kent, and with the assistance of [[Nothelm|Nothhelm]], at that time a priest in London, obtained copies of [[Gregory the Great]]'s correspondence from Rome relating to Augustine's mission.<ref name=ODNB/><ref name=Farmer_25/><ref name=BEASE_Nothhelm>Keynes, \"Nothhelm\", pp.&nbsp;335&nbsp;336.</ref> Almost all of Bede's information regarding Augustine is taken from these letters.<ref name=ODNB/> Bede acknowledged his correspondents in the preface to the ''Historia Ecclesiastica'';<ref name=\"HE_pref\">Bede, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'', Preface, p.&nbsp;42.</ref> he was in contact with [[Daniel of Winchester|Daniel]], the Bishop of Winchester, for information about the history of the church in Wessex, and also wrote to the monastery at [[Lastingham]] for information about [[Cedd]] and [[Chad of Mercia|Chad]].<ref name=HE_pref/> Bede also mentions an Abbot Esi as a source for the affairs of the East Anglian church, and Bishop [[Kinebertus|Cynibert]] for information about Lindsey.<ref name=HE_pref/>\n\nThe historian [[Walter Goffart]] argues that Bede based the structure of the ''Historia'' on three works, using them as the framework around which the three main sections of the work were structured. For the early part of the work, up until the Gregorian mission, Goffart feels that Bede used [[Gildas]]'s ''De excidio''. The second section, detailing the [[Gregorian mission]] of [[Augustine of Canterbury]] was framed on the anonymous ''Life of Gregory the Great'' written at Whitby. The last section, detailing events after the Gregorian mission, Goffart feels were modelled on [[Eddius|Stephen of Ripon]]'s ''Life of Wilfrid''.<ref name=Goffart296>{{harvnb|Goffart|1988| pp=296\u2013307}}</ref> Most of Bede's informants for information after Augustine's mission came from the eastern part of Britain, leaving significant gaps in the knowledge of the western areas, which were those areas likely to have a native Briton presence.<ref name=Deconstruct7>{{harvnb|Brooks |2006|pp=7\u201310}}</ref><ref name=Deconstruct12>{{harvnb|Brooks |2006|pp=12\u201314}}</ref>\n\n=== Models and style ===\nBede's stylistic models included some of the same authors from whom he drew the material for the earlier parts of his history. His introduction imitates the work of Orosius,<ref name=ODNB/> and his title is an echo of Eusebius's ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiastica]]''.<ref name=ASEEncBede/> Bede also followed Eusebius in taking the ''[[Acts of the Apostles]]'' as the model for the overall work: where Eusebius used the ''Acts'' as the theme for his description of the development of the church, Bede made it the model for his history of the Anglo-Saxon church.<ref name=Farmer_26>{{harvnb|Farmer|1978|p=26}}</ref> Bede quoted his sources at length in his narrative, as Eusebius had done.<ref name=ODNB/> Bede also appears to have taken quotes directly from his correspondents at times. For example, he almost always uses the terms \"Australes\" and \"Occidentales\" for the South and West Saxons respectively, but in a passage in the first book he uses \"Meridiani\" and \"Occidui\" instead, as perhaps his informant had done.<ref name=ODNB/> At the end of the work, Bede added a brief autobiographical note; this was an idea taken from [[Gregory of Tours]]' earlier ''History of the Franks''.<ref name=Farmer_27>{{harvnb|Farmer|1978|p=27}}</ref>\n\nBede's work as a [[hagiography|hagiographer]], and his detailed attention to dating, were both useful preparations for the task of writing the ''Historia Ecclesiastica''. His interest in [[computus]], the science of calculating the date of Easter, was also useful in the account he gives of the controversy between the British and Anglo-Saxon church over the correct method of obtaining the Easter date.<ref name=Farmer_21 />\n\nBede is described by [[Michael Lapidge]] as \"without question the most accomplished Latinist produced in these islands in the Anglo-Saxon period\".<ref>{{harvnb|Lapidge|2005|p=323}}</ref> His Latin has been praised for its clarity, but his style in the ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' is not simple. He knew rhetoric, and often used figures of speech and rhetorical forms which cannot easily be reproduced in translation, depending as they often do on the connotations of the Latin words. However, unlike contemporaries such as [[Aldhelm]], whose Latin is full of difficulties, Bede's own text is easy to read.<ref name=CM_xxxvii>{{harvnb|Colgrave|Mynors|1969|pp=xxxvii\u2013xxxviii}}</ref> In the words of Charles Plummer, one of the best-known editors of the ''Historia Ecclesiastica'', Bede's Latin is \"clear and limpid&nbsp;... it is very seldom that we have to pause to think of the meaning of a sentence&nbsp;... Alcuin rightly praises Bede for his unpretending style.\"<ref name=Plummer_I_liii>Plummer, ''Bedae Opera Historica'', vol. I, pp.&nbsp;liii\u2013liv.</ref>\n\n=== Intent ===\nBede's primary intention in writing the ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' was to show the growth of the united church throughout England. The native Britons, whose Christian church survived the departure of the Romans, earn Bede's ire for refusing to help convert the Saxons; by the end of the ''Historia'' the English, and their Church, are dominant over the Britons.<ref name=CM_xxx>{{harvnb|Colgrave|Mynors|1969|pp=xxx\u2013xxxi}}</ref> This goal, of showing the movement towards unity, explains Bede's animosity towards the British method of calculating Easter: much of the ''Historia'' is devoted to a history of the dispute, including the final resolution at the [[Synod of Whitby]] in 664.<ref name=Farmer_27/> Bede is also concerned to show the unity of the English, despite the disparate kingdoms that still existed when he was writing. He also wants to instruct the reader by spiritual example, and to entertain, and to the latter end he adds stories about many of the places and people about which he wrote.<ref name=\"CM_xxx\"/>\n\nN.J. Higham argues that Bede designed his work to promote his reform agenda to Ceolwulf, the Northumbrian king. Bede painted a highly optimistic picture of the current situation in the Church, as opposed to the more pessimistic picture found in his private letters.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Higham | first1 = N.J. | year = 2013 | title = Bede's Agenda in Book IV of the 'Ecclesiastical History of the English People': A Tricky Matter of Advising the King | url = | journal = Journal of Ecclesiastical History | volume = 64 | issue = 3| pages = 476\u2013493 | doi=10.1017/s0022046913000523}}</ref>\n\nBede's extensive use of miracles can prove difficult for readers who consider him a more or less reliable historian, but do not accept the possibility of miracles.\nYet both reflect an inseparable integrity and regard for accuracy and truth, expressed in terms both of historical events and of a tradition of Christian faith that continues to the present day. Bede, like Gregory the Great whom Bede quotes on the subject in the ''Historia'', felt that faith brought about by miracles was a stepping stone to a higher, truer faith, and that as a result miracles had their place in a work designed to instruct.<ref name=CM_xxxiv>{{harvnb|Colgrave|Mynors|1969|pp=xxxiv\u2013xxxvi}}</ref>\n\n=== Omissions and biases ===\nBede is somewhat reticent about the career of [[Wilfrid]], a contemporary and one of the most prominent clerics of his day. This may be because Wilfrid's opulent lifestyle was uncongenial to Bede's monastic mind; it may also be that the events of Wilfrid's life, divisive and controversial as they were, simply did not fit with Bede's theme of the progression to a unified and harmonious church.<ref name=Farmer_31/>\n\nBede's account of the early migrations of the Angles and Saxons to England omits any mention of a movement of those peoples across the channel from Britain to Brittany described by [[Procopius]], who was writing in the sixth century. [[Frank Stenton]] describes this omission as \"a scholar's dislike of the indefinite\"; traditional material that could not be dated or used for Bede's didactic purposes had no interest for him.<ref name=\"Stenton_8\u20139\">{{harvnb|Stenton|1971|pp=8\u20139}}</ref>\n\nBede was a Northumbrian, and this tinged his work with a local bias.<ref name=JMWH_xxxi>{{harvnb|Wallace-Hadrill|1988|p=xxxi}}</ref> The sources to which he had access gave him less information about the west of England than for other areas.<ref name=TCOB_119>{{harvnb|Yorke|2006|p=119}}</ref> He says relatively little about the achievements of Mercia and Wessex, omitting, for example, any mention of [[Boniface]], a West Saxon missionary to the continent of some renown and of whom Bede had almost certainly heard, though Bede does discuss Northumbrian missionaries to the continent. He also is parsimonious in his praise for [[Aldhelm]], a West Saxon who had done much to convert the native Britons to the Roman form of Christianity. He lists seven kings of the Anglo-Saxons whom he regards as having held ''imperium'', or overlordship; only one king of Wessex, [[Ceawlin]], is listed, and none from Mercia, though elsewhere he acknowledges the secular power several of the Mercians held.<ref name=\"TCOB_21\u20132\">{{harvnb|Yorke|2006|pp=21\u201322}}</ref> Historian [[Robin Fleming]] states that he was so hostile to Mercia because Northumbria had been diminished by Mercian power that he consulted no Mercian informants and included no stories about its saints.<ref>{{harvnb|Fleming|2011|p=111}}</ref>\n\nBede relates the story of Augustine's mission from Rome, and tells how the British clergy refused to assist Augustine in the conversion of the Anglo-Saxons. This, combined with Gildas's negative assessment of the British church at the time of the Anglo-Saxon invasions, led Bede to a very critical view of the native church. However, Bede ignores the fact that at the time of Augustine's mission, the history between the two was one of warfare and conquest, which, in the words of [[Barbara Yorke]], would have naturally \"curbed any missionary impulses towards the Anglo-Saxons from the British clergy.\"<ref name=TCOB_118>{{harvnb|Yorke|2006|p=118}}</ref>\n\n=== Use of ''Anno Domini'' ===\nAt the time Bede wrote the ''Historia Ecclesiastica'', there were two common ways of referring to dates. One was to use [[indiction]]s, which were 15-year cycles, counting from 312 AD. There were three different varieties of indiction, each starting on a different day of the year. The other approach was to use regnal years\u2014the reigning Roman emperor, for example, or the ruler of whichever kingdom was under discussion. This meant that in discussing conflicts between kingdoms, the date would have to be given in the regnal years of all the kings involved. Bede used both these approaches on occasion, but adopted a third method as his main approach to dating: the ''[[Anno Domini]]'' method invented by [[Dionysius Exiguus]].<ref name=CM_xviii>{{harvnb|Colgrave|Mynors|1969|pp=xviii\u2013xix}}</ref> Although Bede did not invent this method, his adoption of it, and his promulgation of it in ''De Temporum Ratione'', his work on chronology, is the main reason it is now so widely used.<ref name=CM_xviii/><ref name=Stenton_186>{{harvnb|Stenton|1971|p=186}}</ref> Beda Venerabilis' Easter table, contained in ''De Temporum Ratione'', was developed from Dionysius Exiguus\u2019 famous Paschal table.\n\n=== Assessment ===\nThe ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' was copied often in the Middle Ages, and about 160 manuscripts containing it survive. About half of those are located on the European continent, rather than in the British Isles.<ref name=Companion4/> Most of the 8th- and 9th-century texts of Bede's ''Historia'' come from the northern parts of the [[Carolingian]] Empire.<ref name=Reread21>{{harvnb|Higham|2006|p=21}}</ref> This total does not include manuscripts with only a part of the work, of which another 100 or so survive. It was printed for the first time between 1474 and 1482, probably at [[Strasbourg, France]].<ref name=Companion4>{{harvnb|Wright|2008|pp=4\u20135}}</ref> Modern historians have studied the ''Historia'' extensively, and a number of editions have been produced.<ref name=Nar236/> For many years, early Anglo-Saxon history was essentially a retelling of the ''Historia'', but recent scholarship has focused as much on what Bede did not write as what he did. The belief that the ''Historia'' was the culmination of Bede's works, the aim of all his scholarship, a belief common among historians in the past, is no longer accepted by most scholars.<ref name=Nar238>{{harvnb|Goffart |1988|pp= 238\u2013239}}</ref>\n\nModern historians and editors of Bede have been lavish in their praise of his achievement in the ''Historia Ecclesiastica''. Stenton regarded it as one of the \"small class of books which transcend all but the most fundamental conditions of time and place\", and regarded its quality as dependent on Bede's \"astonishing power of co-ordinating the fragments of information which came to him through tradition, the relation of friends, or documentary evidence&nbsp;... In an age where little was attempted beyond the registration of fact, he had reached the conception of history.\"<ref name= Stenton_187>{{harvnb|Stenton|1971|p=187}}</ref> [[Patrick Wormald]] described him as \"the first and greatest of England's historians\".<ref name=Worm29>{{harvnb|Wormald|1999|p= 29}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' has given Bede a high reputation, but his concerns were different from those of a modern writer of history.<ref name=ODNB/> His focus on the history of the organisation of the English church, and on heresies and the efforts made to root them out, led him to exclude the secular history of kings and kingdoms except where a moral lesson could be drawn or where they illuminated events in the church.<ref name=ODNB/> Besides the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', the medieval writers [[William of Malmesbury]], [[Henry of Huntingdon]], and [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] used his works as sources and inspirations.<ref name=Reread27>{{harvnb|Higham|2006|p=27}}</ref> Early modern writers, such as [[Polydore Vergil]] and [[Matthew Parker]], the Elizabethan Archbishop of Canterbury, also utilised the ''Historia'', and his works were used by both Protestant and Catholic sides in the Wars of Religion.<ref name=Reread33>{{harvnb|Higham|2006|p=33}}</ref>\n\nSome historians have questioned the reliability of some of Bede's accounts. One historian, Charlotte Behr, thinks that the ''Historia's'' account of the arrival of the Germanic invaders in Kent should not be considered to relate what actually happened, but rather relates myths that were current in Kent during Bede's time.<ref name=Behr>{{harvnb|Behr|2000|pp=25\u201352}}</ref>\n\nIt is likely that Bede's work, because it was so widely copied, discouraged others from writing histories and may even have led to the disappearance of manuscripts containing older historical works.<ref name=Plummer_I_xlvii>Plummer, ''Bedae Opera Historica'', vol. I, p.&nbsp;xlvii and note.</ref>\n\n== Other historical works ==\n[[File:Athelstan.jpg|thumb|upright|A page from a copy of Bede's ''Lives of St. Cuthbert'', showing [[Athelstan of England|King Athelstan]] presenting the work to the saint. This manuscript was given to St. Cuthbert's shrine in 934.<ref name=OIHBM_42>{{harvnb|Cannon|Griffiths|1997 |pp=42\u201343}}</ref>]]\n\n=== Chronicles ===\nAs Chapter 66 of his ''On the Reckoning of Time'', in 725 Bede wrote the ''Greater Chronicle'' (''chronica maiora''), which sometimes circulated as a separate work. For recent events the ''Chronicle'', like his ''Ecclesiastical History'', relied upon Gildas, upon a version of the ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]'' current at least to the papacy of [[Pope Sergius I]] (687\u2013701), and other sources. For earlier events he drew on [[Eusebius]]'s ''Chronikoi Kanones.'' The dating of events in the ''Chronicle'' is inconsistent with his other works, using the era of creation, the ''[[Anno Mundi]]''.<ref>Wallis (trans.), ''The Reckoning of Time'', pp. lxvii\u2013lxxi, 157\u2013237, 353\u201366</ref>\n\n=== Lives ===\nHis other historical works included lives of the abbots of [[Jarrow#Wearmouth-Jarrow Priory|Wearmouth and Jarrow]], as well as verse and prose lives of [[Cuthbert of Lindisfarne|Saint Cuthbert of Lindisfarne]], an adaptation of [[Paulinus of Nola]]'s ''Life of St Felix'', and a translation of the Greek ''Passion of [[Saint Anastasius|St Anastasius]]''. He also created a listing of saints, the ''Martyrology''.<ref name=Goffart245>{{harvnb|Goffart |1988|pp=245\u2013246}}</ref>\n\n== Theological works ==\nIn his own time, Bede was as well known for his biblical commentaries and exegetical, as well as other theological, works. The majority of his writings were of this type, and covered the Old Testament and the New Testament. Most survived the Middle Ages, but a few were lost.<ref name=BedeVen42>{{harvnb|Brown|1987|p=42}}</ref> It was for his theological writings that he earned the title of ''Doctor Anglorum'', and why he was declared a saint.<ref name=Theo>{{harvnb|Ward |2001|pp=57\u201364}}</ref>\n\nBede synthesised and transmitted the learning from his predecessors, as well as made careful, judicious innovation in knowledge (such as recalculating the age of the earth\u2014for which he was censured before surviving the heresy accusations and eventually having his views championed by Archbishop Ussher in the sixteenth century\u2014see below) that had theological implications. In order to do this, he learned Greek, and attempted to learn Hebrew. He spent time reading and rereading both the Old and the New Testaments. He mentions that he studied from a text of [[Jerome]]'s [[Vulgate]], which itself was from the Hebrew text. He also studied both the Latin and the Greek Fathers of the Church. In the monastic library at Jarrow were a number of books by theologians, including works by [[Basil of Caesarea|Basil]], [[John Cassian|Cassian]], [[John Chrysostom]], [[Isidore of Seville]], [[Origen]], [[Gregory of Nazianzus]], [[Augustine of Hippo]], [[Jerome]], [[Pope Gregory I]], [[Ambrose of Milan]], [[Cassiodorus]], and [[Cyprian]].<ref name=CM_xxv/><ref name=Theo/> He used these, in conjunction with the Biblical texts themselves, to write his commentaries and other theological works.<ref name=Theo/> He had a Latin translation by [[Evagrius of Antioch|Evagrius]] of [[Athanasius]]'s ''Life of Antony'', and a copy of [[Sulpicius Severus]]' ''Life of St. Martin''.<ref name=CM_xxv/> He also used lesser known writers, such as [[Fulgentius of Ruspe|Fulgentius]], [[Julian of Eclanum]], [[Tyconius]], and [[Prosper of Aquitaine]]. Bede was the first to refer to Jerome, Augustine, Pope Gregory and Ambrose as the four Latin [[Fathers of the Church]].<ref name=Ward44>{{harvnb|Ward|1990|p=44}}</ref> It is clear from Bede's own comments that he felt his calling was to explain to his students and readers the theology and thoughts of the Church Fathers.<ref name=Mey827>{{harvnb|Meyvaert|1996|p=827}}</ref>\n\nBede also wrote homilies, works written to explain theology used in worship services. Bede wrote homilies not only on the major Christian seasons such as [[Advent]], [[Lent]], or Easter, but on other subjects such as anniversaries of significant events.<ref name=Theo/>\n\nBoth types of Bede's theological works circulated widely in the Middle Ages. A number of his biblical commentaries were incorporated into the ''[[Glossa Ordinaria]]'', an 11th-century collection of biblical commentaries. Some of Bede's homilies were collected by [[Paul the Deacon]], and they were used in that form in the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Monastic Office]]. [[Saint Boniface]] used Bede's homilies in his missionary efforts on the continent.<ref name=Theo/>\n\nBede sometimes included in his theological books an acknowledgement of the predecessors on whose works he drew. In two cases he left instructions that his marginal notes, which gave the details of his sources, should be preserved by the copyist, and he may have originally added marginal comments about his sources to others of his works. Where he does not specify, it is still possible to identify books to which he must have had access by quotations that he uses. A full catalogue of the library available to Bede in the monastery cannot be reconstructed, but it is possible to tell, for example, that Bede was very familiar with the works of Virgil. There is little evidence that he had access to any other of the pagan Latin writers\u2014he quotes many of these writers but the quotes are almost all to be found in the Latin grammars that were common in his day, one or more of which would certainly have been at the monastery. Another difficulty is that manuscripts of early writers were often incomplete: it is apparent that Bede had access to Pliny's ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Encyclopedia]]'', for example, but it seems that the version he had was missing book xviii, as he would almost certainly have quoted from it in his ''De temporum ratione''.<ref name=BLTW_Laistner>M.L.W.

He gives some information about the months of the Anglo-Saxon calendar in chapter XV.<ref name=\"Bede2004pp53-4\">{{harvnb|Bede|2004|pp=53\u201354, 285\u2013287}}; see also [http://www.nabkal.de/beda/beda_15.html]</ref> Any codex of Beda Venerabilis' Easter table is normally found together with a codex of his ''De temporum ratione''. Bede's Easter table, covering the time interval AD 532\u20131063,<ref>Zuidhoek (2019) 106-120</ref> contains a 532-year Paschal cycle based on a Metonic 19-year lunar cycle.<ref>Zuidhoek (2019) 70</ref> As a matter of fact, Bede\u2019s Easter table owes its strong Metonic structure to the mental efforts of his computistical predecessors [[Anatolius of Laodicea|Anatolius]], [[Annianus of Alexandria|Annianus]], and [[Dionysius Exiguus]]. \n\nFor calendric purposes, Bede made a new calculation of the [[Dating creation|age of the world]] since the [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]], which he dated as 3952 BC. Due to his innovations in computing the age of the world, he was accused of heresy at the table of Bishop [[Wilfrid]], his chronology being contrary to accepted calculations. Once informed of the accusations of these \"lewd rustics,\" Bede refuted them in his Letter to Plegwin.<ref name=\"Bede2004ppxxx\">{{harvnb|Bede|2004|pp=xxx, 405\u2013415}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to these works on astronomical timekeeping, he also wrote ''[[De natura rerum (Bede)|De natura rerum]]'', or ''On the Nature of Things'', modelled in part after the work of the same title by [[Isidore of Seville]].<ref name=BedeVen36>{{harvnb|Brown|1987|p=36}}</ref> His works were so influential that late in the ninth century [[Notker the Stammerer]], a monk of the [[Abbey of St. Gall|Monastery of St. Gall]] in Switzerland, wrote that \"God, the orderer of natures, who raised the Sun from the East on the fourth day of Creation, in the sixth day of the world has made Bede rise from the West as a new Sun to illuminate the whole Earth\".<ref name=\"Bede2004plxxxv\">{{harvnb|Bede|2004|p=lxxxv}}</ref>\n\n== Educational works ==\nBede wrote some works designed to help teach grammar in the abbey school. One of these was his ''De arte metrica'', a discussion of the composition of Latin verse, drawing on previous grammarians work. It was based on Donatus' ''De pedibus'' and [[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]]' ''De finalibus'', and used examples from Christian poets as well as Virgil. It became a standard text for the teaching of Latin verse during the next few centuries. Bede dedicated this work to Cuthbert, apparently a student, for he is named \"beloved son\" in the dedication, and Bede says \"I have laboured to educate you in divine letters and ecclesiastical statutes\"<ref name=BedeVen31>{{harvnb|Brown|1987|pp=31\u201332}}</ref> Another textbook of Bede's is the ''De orthographia'', a work on [[orthography]], designed to help a medieval reader of Latin with unfamiliar abbreviations and words from classical Latin works. Although it could serve as a textbook, it appears to have been mainly intended as a reference work. The exact date of composition for both of these works is unknown.<ref name=BedeVen35>{{harvnb|Brown|1987|pp=35\u201336}}</ref>\n\nAnother educational work is ''De schematibus et tropis sacrae scripturae'', which discusses the Bible's use of rhetoric.<ref name=ODNB/> Bede was familiar with pagan authors such as Virgil, but it was not considered appropriate to teach biblical grammar from such texts, and in ''De schematibus&nbsp;...'' Bede argues for the superiority of Christian texts in understanding Christian literature.<ref name=ODNB/><ref name=CM_xxvi>Colgrave gives the example of [[Desiderius of Vienne]], who was reprimanded by Gregory the Great for using \"heathen\" authors in his teaching.</ref> Similarly, his text on poetic metre uses only Christian poetry for examples.<ref name=ODNB/>\n\n== Vernacular poetry ==\nAccording to his disciple Cuthbert, Bede was also ''doctus in nostris carminibus'' (\"learned in our songs\"). Cuthbert's letter on Bede's death, the ''Epistola Cuthberti de obitu Bedae'', moreover, commonly is understood to indicate that Bede also composed a five line vernacular poem known to modern scholars as ''Bede's Death Song''\n{{quote|\nAnd he used to repeat that sentence from [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]] \"It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God,\" and many other verses of Scripture, urging us thereby to awake from the slumber of the soul by thinking in good time of our last hour. And in our own language\u2014for he was familiar with English poetry\u2014speaking of the soul's dread departure from the body:\n{{Verse translation|\n{{lang|ang|Fore \u00f0\u00e6m nedfere n\u00e6nig wior\u00f0e\n\u00f0onc snottora \u00f0on him \u00f0earf si\u00e6\nto ymbhycgenne \u00e6r his hinionge\nhw\u00e6t his gast\u00e6 godes o\u00f0\u00f0e yfles\n\u00e6fter dea\u00f0 d\u00e6ge doemed wior\u00f0e.}}<ref name=\"ColgraveMynors1969pp580-3\">{{harvnb|Colgrave|Mynors|1969|pp=580\u2013583}}</ref>\n|\nFacing that enforced journey, no man can be\nMore prudent than he has good call to be,\nIf he consider, before his going hence,\nWhat for his spirit of good hap or of evil\nAfter his day of death shall be determined.}} }}\n\nAs Opland notes, however, it is not entirely clear that Cuthbert is attributing this text to Bede: most manuscripts of the latter do not use a [[finite verb]] to describe Bede's presentation of the song, and the theme was relatively common in Old English and Anglo-Latin literature. The fact that Cuthbert's description places the performance of the Old English poem in the context of a series of quoted passages from Sacred Scripture, indeed, might be taken as evidence simply that Bede also cited analogous vernacular texts.<ref name=Opland140>{{harvnb|Opland|1980|pp=140\u2013141}}</ref> On the other hand, the inclusion of the Old English text of the poem in Cuthbert's Latin letter, the observation that Bede \"was learned in our song,\" and the fact that Bede composed a Latin poem on the same subject all point to the possibility of his having written it. By citing the poem directly, Cuthbert seems to imply that its particular wording was somehow important, either since it was a vernacular poem endorsed by a scholar who evidently frowned upon secular entertainment<ref name=Mccready14>{{harvnb|McCready|1994|pp=14\u201319}}</ref> or because it is a direct quotation of Bede's last original composition.<ref name=Opland14>{{harvnb|Opland|1980|p=14}}</ref>\n\n== Veneration ==\n[[File:Depiction of St. Bede the Venerable (at St. Bede's school, Chennai) - Image has been cropped for better presentation.jpg|thumb|upright|Bede depicted at St. Bede's school, [[Chennai]]]]\n\nThere is no evidence for cult being paid to Bede in England in the 8th century. One reason for this may be that he died on the feast day of [[Augustine of Canterbury]]. Later, when he was [[veneration|venerated]] in England, he was either commemorated after Augustine on 26 May, or his feast was moved to 27 May. However, he was venerated outside England, mainly through the efforts of [[Saint Boniface|Boniface]] and [[Alcuin]], both of whom promoted the cult on the Continent. Boniface wrote repeatedly back to England during his missionary efforts, requesting copies of Bede's theological works. Alcuin, who was taught at the school set up in York by Bede's pupil [[Ecgbert (bishop)|Egbert]], praised Bede as an example for monks to follow and was instrumental in disseminating Bede's works to all of Alcuin's friends.<ref name=Ward136>{{harvnb|Ward|1990| pp=136\u2013138}}</ref> Bede's cult became prominent in England during the 10th-century revival of monasticism, and by the 14th century had spread to many of the cathedrals of England. [[Wulfstan (Bishop of Worcester)|Wulfstan, Bishop of Worcester]] (c. 1008\u20131095) was a particular devotee of Bede's, dedicating a church to him in 1062, which was Wulfstan's first undertaking after his consecration as bishop.<ref name=Ward139>{{harvnb|Ward|1990| p=139}}</ref>\n\nHis body was '[[translation (relic)|translated]]' (the ecclesiastical term for relocation of relics) from Jarrow to Durham Cathedral around 1020, where it was placed in the same tomb with Saint [[Cuthbert of Lindisfarne]]. Later Bede's remains were moved to a shrine in the Galilee Chapel at [[Durham Cathedral]] in 1370. The shrine was destroyed during the [[English Reformation]], but the bones were reburied in the chapel. In 1831 the bones were dug up and then reburied in a new tomb, which is still there.<ref name=Companion4pic>{{harvnb|Wright|2008|p=4 (caption)}}</ref> Other [[relic]]s were claimed by [[York Minster|York]], [[Glastonbury Abbey|Glastonbury]]<ref name=\"Farmer2004p47-48\"/> and [[Fulda]].<ref name=Reread24>{{harvnb|Higham|2006|p=24}}</ref>\n\nHis scholarship and importance to Catholicism were recognised in 1899 when he was declared a [[Doctor of the Church]].<ref name=ODNB/> He is the only Englishman named a Doctor of the Church.<ref name=SHMI /><ref name=Companion4/> He is also the only Englishman in [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Paradiso (Dante)|Paradise]]'' (''[[Paradiso (Dante)|Paradiso]]'' X.130), mentioned among theologians and doctors of the church in the same canto as [[Isidore of Seville]] and the Scot [[Richard of St. Victor]].\n\nHis feast day was included in the [[General Roman Calendar]] in 1899, for celebration on 27 May rather than on his date of death, 26 May, which was then the feast day of [[Pope Gregory VII]].

While he spent most of his life in the monastery, Bede travelled to several abbeys and monasteries across the British Isles, even visiting the archbishop of York and King Ceolwulf of Northumbria. \n\nHe is well known as an author, teacher (a student of one of his pupils was [[Alcuin]]), and scholar, and his most famous work, ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'', gained him the title \"The Father of [[History of England|English History]]\". His ecumenical writings were extensive and included a number of Biblical commentaries and other theological works of exegetical erudition. Another important area of study for Bede was the academic discipline of ''computus'', otherwise known to his contemporaries as the science of calculating calendar dates. One of the more important dates Bede tried to compute was Easter, an effort that was mired in controversy. He also helped establish the practice of dating forward from the birth of Christ (''[[Anno Domini]]'' \u2013 in the year of our Lord), a practice which eventually became commonplace in medieval Europe. Bede was one of the greatest teachers and writers of the [[Early Middle Ages]] and is considered by many historians to be the single most important scholar of antiquity for the period between the death of [[Pope Gregory I]] in 604 and the coronation of [[Charlemagne]] in 800.\n\nIn 1899, [[Pope Leo XIII]] declared him a [[Doctor of the Church]]. He is the only native of [[Great Britain]] to achieve this designation; [[Anselm of Canterbury]], also a Doctor of the Church, was originally from Italy. Bede was moreover a skilled linguist and translator, and his work made the [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] writings of the early [[Church Fathers]] much more accessible to his fellow [[Anglo-Saxons]], which contributed significantly to English [[Christianity]]. Bede's monastery had access to an impressive library which included works by [[Eusebius]], [[Orosius]], and many others.\n\n== Life ==\n[[File:Opera Bedae Venerabilis.tif|thumb|''Opera Bedae Venerabilis'' (1563)]]\nAlmost everything that is known of Bede's life is contained in the last chapter of his ''Ecclesiastical History of the English People'', a history of the church in England.

The ''Liber Vitae'' of [[Durham Cathedral]] names two priests with this name, one of whom is presumably Bede himself. Some manuscripts of the ''Life of Cuthbert'', one of Bede's works, mention that Cuthbert's own priest was named Bede; it is possible that this priest is the other name listed in the ''Liber Vitae''.<ref name=\"Reread8\" /><ref name=\"ASC14\">{{harvnb|Swanton|1998|pp=14\u201315}}</ref>\n\nAt the age of seven, Bede was sent, as a ''[[puer oblatus]]'',<ref>{{harvnb|Kendall|2010|p=101}}; {{harvnb|Rowley|2017|p=258}}</ref> to the monastery of Monkwearmouth by his family to be educated by Benedict Biscop and later by [[Ceolfrith]].<ref name=World178>{{harvnb|Blair|1990|p=178}}</ref> Bede does not say whether it was already intended at that point that he would be a monk.<ref name=World241>{{harvnb|Blair|1990|p=241}}</ref> It was fairly common in Ireland at this time for young boys, particularly those of noble birth, to be fostered out as an oblate; the practice was also likely to have been common among the Germanic peoples in England.<ref name=CM_xx>{{harvnb|Colgrave|Mynors|1969| p=xx}}</ref> Monkwearmouth's sister monastery at Jarrow was founded by Ceolfrith in 682, and Bede probably transferred to Jarrow with Ceolfrith that year.<ref name=\"Farmer2004p47-48\"/> The dedication stone for the church has survived to the present day; it is dated 23 April 685, and as Bede would have been required to assist with menial tasks in his day-to-day life it is possible that he helped in building the original church.<ref name=\"CM_xx\"/> In 686, plague broke out at Jarrow. The ''Life of Ceolfrith'', written in about 710, records that only two surviving monks were capable of singing the full offices; one was Ceolfrith and the other a young boy, who according to the anonymous writer had been taught by Ceolfrith. The two managed to do the entire service of the liturgy until others could be trained. The young boy was almost certainly Bede, who would have been about 14.<ref name=World178/><ref name=Plummer_I_xii>Plummer, ''Bedae Opera Historica'', vol.

Bede would probably have met the abbot during this visit, and it may be that Adomnan sparked Bede's interest in the [[Easter controversy|Easter dating controversy]].<ref name=World181>{{harvnb|Blair|1990|p=181}}</ref> In about 692, in Bede's nineteenth year, Bede was ordained a [[deacon]] by his diocesan bishop, [[John of Beverley|John]], who was [[bishop of Hexham]].

For the early part of the work, up until the Gregorian mission, Goffart feels that Bede used [[Gildas]]'s ''De excidio''. The second section, detailing the [[Gregorian mission]] of [[Augustine of Canterbury]] was framed on the anonymous ''Life of Gregory the Great'' written at Whitby. The last section, detailing events after the Gregorian mission, Goffart feels were modelled on [[Eddius|Stephen of Ripon]]'s ''Life of Wilfrid''.<ref name=Goffart296>{{harvnb|Goffart|1988| pp=296\u2013307}}</ref> Most of Bede's informants for information after Augustine's mission came from the eastern part of Britain, leaving significant gaps in the knowledge of the western areas, which were those areas likely to have a native Briton presence.<ref name=Deconstruct7>{{harvnb|Brooks |2006|pp=7\u201310}}</ref><ref name=Deconstruct12>{{harvnb|Brooks |2006|pp=12\u201314}}</ref>\n\n=== Models and style ===\nBede's stylistic models included some of the same authors from whom he drew the material for the earlier parts of his history. His introduction imitates the work of Orosius,<ref name=ODNB/> and his title is an echo of Eusebius's ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiastica]]''.<ref name=ASEEncBede/> Bede also followed Eusebius in taking the ''[[Acts of the Apostles]]'' as the model for the overall work: where Eusebius used the ''Acts'' as the theme for his description of the development of the church, Bede made it the model for his history of the Anglo-Saxon church.<ref name=Farmer_26>{{harvnb|Farmer|1978|p=26}}</ref> Bede quoted his sources at length in his narrative, as Eusebius had done.<ref name=ODNB/> Bede also appears to have taken quotes directly from his correspondents at times. For example, he almost always uses the terms \"Australes\" and \"Occidentales\" for the South and West Saxons respectively, but in a passage in the first book he uses \"Meridiani\" and \"Occidui\" instead, as perhaps his informant had done.<ref name=ODNB/> At the end of the work, Bede added a brief autobiographical note; this was an idea taken from [[Gregory of Tours]]' earlier ''History of the Franks''.<ref name=Farmer_27>{{harvnb|Farmer|1978|p=27}}</ref>\n\nBede's work as a [[hagiography|hagiographer]], and his detailed attention to dating, were both useful preparations for the task of writing the ''Historia Ecclesiastica''. His interest in [[computus]], the science of calculating the date of Easter, was also useful in the account he gives of the controversy between the British and Anglo-Saxon church over the correct method of obtaining the Easter date.<ref name=Farmer_21 />\n\nBede is described by [[Michael Lapidge]] as \"without question the most accomplished Latinist produced in these islands in the Anglo-Saxon period\".<ref>{{harvnb|Lapidge|2005|p=323}}</ref> His Latin has been praised for its clarity, but his style in the ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' is not simple. He knew rhetoric, and often used figures of speech and rhetorical forms which cannot easily be reproduced in translation, depending as they often do on the connotations of the Latin words. However, unlike contemporaries such as [[Aldhelm]], whose Latin is full of difficulties, Bede's own text is easy to read.<ref name=CM_xxxvii>{{harvnb|Colgrave|Mynors|1969|pp=xxxvii\u2013xxxviii}}</ref> In the words of Charles Plummer, one of the best-known editors of the ''Historia Ecclesiastica'', Bede's Latin is \"clear and limpid&nbsp;... it is very seldom that we have to pause to think of the meaning of a sentence&nbsp;... Alcuin rightly praises Bede for his unpretending style.\"<ref name=Plummer_I_liii>Plummer, ''Bedae Opera Historica'', vol. I, pp.&nbsp;liii\u2013liv.</ref>\n\n=== Intent ===\nBede's primary intention in writing the ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' was to show the growth of the united church throughout England. The native Britons, whose Christian church survived the departure of the Romans, earn Bede's ire for refusing to help convert the Saxons; by the end of the ''Historia'' the English, and their Church, are dominant over the Britons.<ref name=CM_xxx>{{harvnb|Colgrave|Mynors|1969|pp=xxx\u2013xxxi}}</ref> This goal, of showing the movement towards unity, explains Bede's animosity towards the British method of calculating Easter: much of the ''Historia'' is devoted to a history of the dispute, including the final resolution at the [[Synod of Whitby]] in 664.<ref name=Farmer_27/> Bede is also concerned to show the unity of the English, despite the disparate kingdoms that still existed when he was writing. He also wants to instruct the reader by spiritual example, and to entertain, and to the latter end he adds stories about many of the places and people about which he wrote.<ref name=\"CM_xxx\"/>\n\nN.J. Higham argues that Bede designed his work to promote his reform agenda to Ceolwulf, the Northumbrian king. Bede painted a highly optimistic picture of the current situation in the Church, as opposed to the more pessimistic picture found in his private letters.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Higham | first1 = N.J. | year = 2013 | title = Bede's Agenda in Book IV of the 'Ecclesiastical History of the English People': A Tricky Matter of Advising the King | url = | journal = Journal of Ecclesiastical History | volume = 64 | issue = 3| pages = 476\u2013493 | doi=10.1017/s0022046913000523}}</ref>\n\nBede's extensive use of miracles can prove difficult for readers who consider him a more or less reliable historian, but do not accept the possibility of miracles.\nYet both reflect an inseparable integrity and regard for accuracy and truth, expressed in terms both of historical events and of a tradition of Christian faith that continues to the present day. Bede, like Gregory the Great whom Bede quotes on the subject in the ''Historia'', felt that faith brought about by miracles was a stepping stone to a higher, truer faith, and that as a result miracles had their place in a work designed to instruct.<ref name=CM_xxxiv>{{harvnb|Colgrave|Mynors|1969|pp=xxxiv\u2013xxxvi}}</ref>\n\n=== Omissions and biases ===\nBede is somewhat reticent about the career of [[Wilfrid]], a contemporary and one of the most prominent clerics of his day. This may be because Wilfrid's opulent lifestyle was uncongenial to Bede's monastic mind; it may also be that the events of Wilfrid's life, divisive and controversial as they were, simply did not fit with Bede's theme of the progression to a unified and harmonious church.<ref name=Farmer_31/>\n\nBede's account of the early migrations of the Angles and Saxons to England omits any mention of a movement of those peoples across the channel from Britain to Brittany described by [[Procopius]], who was writing in the sixth century. [[Frank Stenton]] describes this omission as \"a scholar's dislike of the indefinite\"; traditional material that could not be dated or used for Bede's didactic purposes had no interest for him.<ref name=\"Stenton_8\u20139\">{{harvnb|Stenton|1971|pp=8\u20139}}</ref>\n\nBede was a Northumbrian, and this tinged his work with a local bias.<ref name=JMWH_xxxi>{{harvnb|Wallace-Hadrill|1988|p=xxxi}}</ref> The sources to which he had access gave him less information about the west of England than for other areas.<ref name=TCOB_119>{{harvnb|Yorke|2006|p=119}}</ref> He says relatively little about the achievements of Mercia and Wessex, omitting, for example, any mention of [[Boniface]], a West Saxon missionary to the continent of some renown and of whom Bede had almost certainly heard, though Bede does discuss Northumbrian missionaries to the continent. He also is parsimonious in his praise for [[Aldhelm]], a West Saxon who had done much to convert the native Britons to the Roman form of Christianity. He lists seven kings of the Anglo-Saxons whom he regards as having held ''imperium'', or overlordship; only one king of Wessex, [[Ceawlin]], is listed, and none from Mercia, though elsewhere he acknowledges the secular power several of the Mercians held.<ref name=\"TCOB_21\u20132\">{{harvnb|Yorke|2006|pp=21\u201322}}</ref> Historian [[Robin Fleming]] states that he was so hostile to Mercia because Northumbria had been diminished by Mercian power that he consulted no Mercian informants and included no stories about its saints.<ref>{{harvnb|Fleming|2011|p=111}}</ref>\n\nBede relates the story of Augustine's mission from Rome, and tells how the British clergy refused to assist Augustine in the conversion of the Anglo-Saxons. This, combined with Gildas's negative assessment of the British church at the time of the Anglo-Saxon invasions, led Bede to a very critical view of the native church. However, Bede ignores the fact that at the time of Augustine's mission, the history between the two was one of warfare and conquest, which, in the words of [[Barbara Yorke]], would have naturally \"curbed any missionary impulses towards the Anglo-Saxons from the British clergy.\"<ref name=TCOB_118>{{harvnb|Yorke|2006|p=118}}</ref>\n\n=== Use of ''Anno Domini'' ===\nAt the time Bede wrote the ''Historia Ecclesiastica'', there were two common ways of referring to dates. One was to use [[indiction]]s, which were 15-year cycles, counting from 312 AD. There were three different varieties of indiction, each starting on a different day of the year. The other approach was to use regnal years\u2014the reigning Roman emperor, for example, or the ruler of whichever kingdom was under discussion. This meant that in discussing conflicts between kingdoms, the date would have to be given in the regnal years of all the kings involved. Bede used both these approaches on occasion, but adopted a third method as his main approach to dating: the ''[[Anno Domini]]'' method invented by [[Dionysius Exiguus]].<ref name=CM_xviii>{{harvnb|Colgrave|Mynors|1969|pp=xviii\u2013xix}}</ref> Although Bede did not invent this method, his adoption of it, and his promulgation of it in ''De Temporum Ratione'', his work on chronology, is the main reason it is now so widely used.<ref name=CM_xviii/><ref name=Stenton_186>{{harvnb|Stenton|1971|p=186}}</ref> Beda Venerabilis' Easter table, contained in ''De Temporum Ratione'', was developed from Dionysius Exiguus\u2019 famous Paschal table.\n\n=== Assessment ===\nThe ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' was copied often in the Middle Ages, and about 160 manuscripts containing it survive. About half of those are located on the European continent, rather than in the British Isles.<ref name=Companion4/> Most of the 8th- and 9th-century texts of Bede's ''Historia'' come from the northern parts of the [[Carolingian]] Empire.<ref name=Reread21>{{harvnb|Higham|2006|p=21}}</ref> This total does not include manuscripts with only a part of the work, of which another 100 or so survive. It was printed for the first time between 1474 and 1482, probably at [[Strasbourg, France]].<ref name=Companion4>{{harvnb|Wright|2008|pp=4\u20135}}</ref> Modern historians have studied the ''Historia'' extensively, and a number of editions have been produced.<ref name=Nar236/> For many years, early Anglo-Saxon history was essentially a retelling of the ''Historia'', but recent scholarship has focused as much on what Bede did not write as what he did. The belief that the ''Historia'' was the culmination of Bede's works, the aim of all his scholarship, a belief common among historians in the past, is no longer accepted by most scholars.<ref name=Nar238>{{harvnb|Goffart |1988|pp= 238\u2013239}}</ref>\n\nModern historians and editors of Bede have been lavish in their praise of his achievement in the ''Historia Ecclesiastica''. Stenton regarded it as one of the \"small class of books which transcend all but the most fundamental conditions of time and place\", and regarded its quality as dependent on Bede's \"astonishing power of co-ordinating the fragments of information which came to him through tradition, the relation of friends, or documentary evidence&nbsp;... In an age where little was attempted beyond the registration of fact, he had reached the conception of history.\"<ref name= Stenton_187>{{harvnb|Stenton|1971|p=187}}</ref> [[Patrick Wormald]] described him as \"the first and greatest of England's historians\".<ref name=Worm29>{{harvnb|Wormald|1999|p= 29}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' has given Bede a high reputation, but his concerns were different from those of a modern writer of history.<ref name=ODNB/> His focus on the history of the organisation of the English church, and on heresies and the efforts made to root them out, led him to exclude the secular history of kings and kingdoms except where a moral lesson could be drawn or where they illuminated events in the church.<ref name=ODNB/> Besides the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', the medieval writers [[William of Malmesbury]], [[Henry of Huntingdon]], and [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] used his works as sources and inspirations.<ref name=Reread27>{{harvnb|Higham|2006|p=27}}</ref> Early modern writers, such as [[Polydore Vergil]] and [[Matthew Parker]], the Elizabethan Archbishop of Canterbury, also utilised the ''Historia'', and his works were used by both Protestant and Catholic sides in the Wars of Religion.<ref name=Reread33>{{harvnb|Higham|2006|p=33}}</ref>\n\nSome historians have questioned the reliability of some of Bede's accounts. One historian, Charlotte Behr, thinks that the ''Historia's'' account of the arrival of the Germanic invaders in Kent should not be considered to relate what actually happened, but rather relates myths that were current in Kent during Bede's time.<ref name=Behr>{{harvnb|Behr|2000|pp=25\u201352}}</ref>\n\nIt is likely that Bede's work, because it was so widely copied, discouraged others from writing histories and may even have led to the disappearance of manuscripts containing older historical works.<ref name=Plummer_I_xlvii>Plummer, ''Bedae Opera Historica'', vol. I, p.&nbsp;xlvii and note.</ref>\n\n== Other historical works ==\n[[File:Athelstan.jpg|thumb|upright|A page from a copy of Bede's ''Lives of St. Cuthbert'', showing [[Athelstan of England|King Athelstan]] presenting the work to the saint.

For recent events the ''Chronicle'', like his ''Ecclesiastical History'', relied upon Gildas, upon a version of the ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]'' current at least to the papacy of [[Pope Sergius I]] (687\u2013701), and other sources. For earlier events he drew on [[Eusebius]]'s ''Chronikoi Kanones.'' The dating of events in the ''Chronicle'' is inconsistent with his other works, using the era of creation, the ''[[Anno Mundi]]''.<ref>Wallis (trans.), ''The Reckoning of Time'', pp. lxvii\u2013lxxi, 157\u2013237, 353\u201366</ref>\n\n=== Lives ===\nHis other historical works included lives of the abbots of [[Jarrow#Wearmouth-Jarrow Priory|Wearmouth and Jarrow]], as well as verse and prose lives of [[Cuthbert of Lindisfarne|Saint Cuthbert of Lindisfarne]], an adaptation of [[Paulinus of Nola]]'s ''Life of St Felix'', and a translation of the Greek ''Passion of [[Saint Anastasius|St Anastasius]]''. He also created a listing of saints, the ''Martyrology''.<ref name=Goffart245>{{harvnb|Goffart |1988|pp=245\u2013246}}</ref>\n\n== Theological works ==\nIn his own time, Bede was as well known for his biblical commentaries and exegetical, as well as other theological, works. The majority of his writings were of this type, and covered the Old Testament and the New Testament. Most survived the Middle Ages, but a few were lost.<ref name=BedeVen42>{{harvnb|Brown|1987|p=42}}</ref> It was for his theological writings that he earned the title of ''Doctor Anglorum'', and why he was declared a saint.<ref name=Theo>{{harvnb|Ward |2001|pp=57\u201364}}</ref>\n\nBede synthesised and transmitted the learning from his predecessors, as well as made careful, judicious innovation in knowledge (such as recalculating the age of the earth\u2014for which he was censured before surviving the heresy accusations and eventually having his views championed by Archbishop Ussher in the sixteenth century\u2014see below) that had theological implications. In order to do this, he learned Greek, and attempted to learn Hebrew. He spent time reading and rereading both the Old and the New Testaments. He mentions that he studied from a text of [[Jerome]]'s [[Vulgate]], which itself was from the Hebrew text. He also studied both the Latin and the Greek Fathers of the Church. In the monastic library at Jarrow were a number of books by theologians, including works by [[Basil of Caesarea|Basil]], [[John Cassian|Cassian]], [[John Chrysostom]], [[Isidore of Seville]], [[Origen]], [[Gregory of Nazianzus]], [[Augustine of Hippo]], [[Jerome]], [[Pope Gregory I]], [[Ambrose of Milan]], [[Cassiodorus]], and [[Cyprian]].<ref name=CM_xxv/><ref name=Theo/> He used these, in conjunction with the Biblical texts themselves, to write his commentaries and other theological works.<ref name=Theo/> He had a Latin translation by [[Evagrius of Antioch|Evagrius]] of [[Athanasius]]'s ''Life of Antony'', and a copy of [[Sulpicius Severus]]' ''Life of St. Martin''.<ref name=CM_xxv/> He also used lesser known writers, such as [[Fulgentius of Ruspe|Fulgentius]], [[Julian of Eclanum]], [[Tyconius]], and [[Prosper of Aquitaine]]. Bede was the first to refer to Jerome, Augustine, Pope Gregory and Ambrose as the four Latin [[Fathers of the Church]].<ref name=Ward44>{{harvnb|Ward|1990|p=44}}</ref> It is clear from Bede's own comments that he felt his calling was to explain to his students and readers the theology and thoughts of the Church Fathers.<ref name=Mey827>{{harvnb|Meyvaert|1996|p=827}}</ref>\n\nBede also wrote homilies, works written to explain theology used in worship services. Bede wrote homilies not only on the major Christian seasons such as [[Advent]], [[Lent]], or Easter, but on other subjects such as anniversaries of significant events.<ref name=Theo/>\n\nBoth types of Bede's theological works circulated widely in the Middle Ages. A number of his biblical commentaries were incorporated into the ''[[Glossa Ordinaria]]'', an 11th-century collection of biblical commentaries. Some of Bede's homilies were collected by [[Paul the Deacon]], and they were used in that form in the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Monastic Office]]. [[Saint Boniface]] used Bede's homilies in his missionary efforts on the continent.<ref name=Theo/>\n\nBede sometimes included in his theological books an acknowledgement of the predecessors on whose works he drew. In two cases he left instructions that his marginal notes, which gave the details of his sources, should be preserved by the copyist, and he may have originally added marginal comments about his sources to others of his works. Where he does not specify, it is still possible to identify books to which he must have had access by quotations that he uses. A full catalogue of the library available to Bede in the monastery cannot be reconstructed, but it is possible to tell, for example, that Bede was very familiar with the works of Virgil. There is little evidence that he had access to any other of the pagan Latin writers\u2014he quotes many of these writers but the quotes are almost all to be found in the Latin grammars that were common in his day, one or more of which would certainly have been at the monastery. Another difficulty is that manuscripts of early writers were often incomplete: it is apparent that Bede had access to Pliny's ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Encyclopedia]]'', for example, but it seems that the version he had was missing book xviii, as he would almost certainly have quoted from it in his ''De temporum ratione''.<ref name=BLTW_Laistner>M.L.W.

He gives some information about the months of the Anglo-Saxon calendar in chapter XV.<ref name=\"Bede2004pp53-4\">{{harvnb|Bede|2004|pp=53\u201354, 285\u2013287}}; see also [http://www.nabkal.de/beda/beda_15.html]</ref> Any codex of Beda Venerabilis' Easter table is normally found together with a codex of his ''De temporum ratione''.

Due to his innovations in computing the age of the world, he was accused of heresy at the table of Bishop [[Wilfrid]], his chronology being contrary to accepted calculations. Once informed of the accusations of these \"lewd rustics,\" Bede refuted them in his Letter to Plegwin.<ref name=\"Bede2004ppxxx\">{{harvnb|Bede|2004|pp=xxx, 405\u2013415}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to these works on astronomical timekeeping, he also wrote ''[[De natura rerum (Bede)|De natura rerum]]'', or ''On the Nature of Things'', modelled in part after the work of the same title by [[Isidore of Seville]].<ref name=BedeVen36>{{harvnb|Brown|1987|p=36}}</ref> His works were so influential that late in the ninth century [[Notker the Stammerer]], a monk of the [[Abbey of St. Gall|Monastery of St. Gall]] in Switzerland, wrote that \"God, the orderer of natures, who raised the Sun from the East on the fourth day of Creation, in the sixth day of the world has made Bede rise from the West as a new Sun to illuminate the whole Earth\".<ref name=\"Bede2004plxxxv\">{{harvnb|Bede|2004|p=lxxxv}}</ref>\n\n== Educational works ==\nBede wrote some works designed to help teach grammar in the abbey school. One of these was his ''De arte metrica'', a discussion of the composition of Latin verse, drawing on previous grammarians work. It was based on Donatus' ''De pedibus'' and [[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]]' ''De finalibus'', and used examples from Christian poets as well as Virgil. It became a standard text for the teaching of Latin verse during the next few centuries. Bede dedicated this work to Cuthbert, apparently a student, for he is named \"beloved son\" in the dedication, and Bede says \"I have laboured to educate you in divine letters and ecclesiastical statutes\"<ref name=BedeVen31>{{harvnb|Brown|1987|pp=31\u201332}}</ref> Another textbook of Bede's is the ''De orthographia'', a work on [[orthography]], designed to help a medieval reader of Latin with unfamiliar abbreviations and words from classical Latin works. Although it could serve as a textbook, it appears to have been mainly intended as a reference work. The exact date of composition for both of these works is unknown.<ref name=BedeVen35>{{harvnb|Brown|1987|pp=35\u201336}}</ref>\n\nAnother educational work is ''De schematibus et tropis sacrae scripturae'', which discusses the Bible's use of rhetoric.<ref name=ODNB/> Bede was familiar with pagan authors such as Virgil, but it was not considered appropriate to teach biblical grammar from such texts, and in ''De schematibus&nbsp;...'' Bede argues for the superiority of Christian texts in understanding Christian literature.<ref name=ODNB/><ref name=CM_xxvi>Colgrave gives the example of [[Desiderius of Vienne]], who was reprimanded by Gregory the Great for using \"heathen\" authors in his teaching.</ref> Similarly, his text on poetic metre uses only Christian poetry for examples.<ref name=ODNB/>\n\n== Vernacular poetry ==\nAccording to his disciple Cuthbert, Bede was also ''doctus in nostris carminibus'' (\"learned in our songs\"). Cuthbert's letter on Bede's death, the ''Epistola Cuthberti de obitu Bedae'', moreover, commonly is understood to indicate that Bede also composed a five line vernacular poem known to modern scholars as ''Bede's Death Song''\n{{quote|\nAnd he used to repeat that sentence from [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]] \"It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God,\" and many other verses of Scripture, urging us thereby to awake from the slumber of the soul by thinking in good time of our last hour.

The fact that Cuthbert's description places the performance of the Old English poem in the context of a series of quoted passages from Sacred Scripture, indeed, might be taken as evidence simply that Bede also cited analogous vernacular texts.<ref name=Opland140>{{harvnb|Opland|1980|pp=140\u2013141}}</ref> On the other hand, the inclusion of the Old English text of the poem in Cuthbert's Latin letter, the observation that Bede \"was learned in our song,\" and the fact that Bede composed a Latin poem on the same subject all point to the possibility of his having written it. By citing the poem directly, Cuthbert seems to imply that its particular wording was somehow important, either since it was a vernacular poem endorsed by a scholar who evidently frowned upon secular entertainment<ref name=Mccready14>{{harvnb|McCready|1994|pp=14\u201319}}</ref> or because it is a direct quotation of Bede's last original composition.<ref name=Opland14>{{harvnb|Opland|1980|p=14}}</ref>\n\n== Veneration ==\n[[File:Depiction of St. Bede the Venerable (at St. Bede's school, Chennai) - Image has been cropped for better presentation.jpg|thumb|upright|Bede depicted at St. Bede's school, [[Chennai]]]]\n\nThere is no evidence for cult being paid to Bede in England in the 8th century. One reason for this may be that he died on the feast day of [[Augustine of Canterbury]]. Later, when he was [[veneration|venerated]] in England, he was either commemorated after Augustine on 26 May, or his feast was moved to 27 May. However, he was venerated outside England, mainly through the efforts of [[Saint Boniface|Boniface]] and [[Alcuin]], both of whom promoted the cult on the Continent. Boniface wrote repeatedly back to England during his missionary efforts, requesting copies of Bede's theological works. Alcuin, who was taught at the school set up in York by Bede's pupil [[Ecgbert (bishop)|Egbert]], praised Bede as an example for monks to follow and was instrumental in disseminating Bede's works to all of Alcuin's friends.<ref name=Ward136>{{harvnb|Ward|1990| pp=136\u2013138}}</ref> Bede's cult became prominent in England during the 10th-century revival of monasticism, and by the 14th century had spread to many of the cathedrals of England. [[Wulfstan (Bishop of Worcester)|Wulfstan, Bishop of Worcester]] (c. 1008\u20131095) was a particular devotee of Bede's, dedicating a church to him in 1062, which was Wulfstan's first undertaking after his consecration as bishop.<ref name=Ward139>{{harvnb|Ward|1990| p=139}}</ref>\n\nHis body was '[[translation (relic)|translated]]' (the ecclesiastical term for relocation of relics) from Jarrow to Durham Cathedral around 1020, where it was placed in the same tomb with Saint [[Cuthbert of Lindisfarne]]. Later Bede's remains were moved to a shrine in the Galilee Chapel at [[Durham Cathedral]] in 1370. The shrine was destroyed during the [[English Reformation]], but the bones were reburied in the chapel.

An example of a basic home safe with 12&nbsp;mm steel door & 6mm steel case that can be bolted to a concrete floor]]\n\nA '''safe''' (also called a '''strongbox''' or '''coffer''') is a secure [[Lock (security device)|lockable]] box used for securing valuable objects against [[theft]] and/or damage from fire. A safe is usually a hollow [[cuboid]] or cylinder, with one face being removable or [[hinge]]d to form a [[door]]. The body and door may be [[Casting (metalworking)|cast]] from [[metal]] (such as [[steel]]) or formed out of plastic through [[blow molding]]. Bank teller safes typically are secured to the counter, have a slit opening for dropping valuables into the safe without opening it, and a time-delay combination lock to foil robbers/and or thieves. One significant distinction between types of safes is whether the safe is secured to a wall or structure or if it can be moved around. A less secure version (only suitable for [[petty cash]]) is usually called a cash-box.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Chubb building modern.jpg|thumb|The Chubb Building, Fryer Street, in [[Wolverhampton]]]]\n{{Expand section|date=January 2012}}\nIn 1835, English inventors [[Charles Chubb (businessman)|Charles]] and [[Jeremiah Chubb]] in [[Wolverhampton]], [[England]], received a patent for a burglar-resisting safe and began a production of safes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chubbsafes.com/about/history/Pages/default.aspx|title=History|publisher=|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100909090849/http://www.chubbsafes.com/about/history/Pages/default.aspx|archive-date=2010-09-09|df=}}</ref> The Chubb brothers had produced locks since 1818. [[Chubb Locks]] was an independent company until 2000 when it was sold to [[Assa Abloy]].\n\nOn November 2, 1886, inventor [[Henry Brown (inventor)|Henry Brown]] patented a \"receptacle for storing and preserving papers\". The container was fire retardant and accident resistant as it was made from forged metal. The box was able to be safely secured with a lock and key and also able to maintain organization by offering different slots to organize important papers.<ref name=\"About\">{{cite web | author= | year=2011 | title=Henry Brown | work=Inventors | publisher=[[About.com]] | url=http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blbrown.htm | access-date=9 March 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"Bio\">{{cite web | author= | year=2011 | title=Little Known Facts | work=Black History Inventions and Discoveries | publisher=[[Biography.com]] | url=http://www.biography.com/tv/classroom/black-history-inventions-and-discoveries | access-date=13 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Specifications==\nSpecifications for safes include some or all of the following parameters:\n* Burglar-resistance\n* Fire-resistance\n* Environmental resistance (e.g., to water or dust)\n* Type of lock (e.g., [[Combination lock|combination]], key, [[time lock]], [[electronic lock]]ing)\n* Location (e.g., wall safe, floor safe)\n* Smart safes as part of an [[automated cash handling]] system\n\nIt is often possible to open a safe without access to the [[Key (lock)|key]] or knowledge of the combination; this activity is known as [[safe-cracking]] and is a popular theme in [[heist film]]s.\n\nA [[diversion safe]], or hidden safe, is a safe that is made from an otherwise ordinary object such as a book, a candle, a can, or even a wall outlet plug. Valuables are placed in these hidden safes, which are themselves [[Security through obscurity|placed inconspicuously]] (for example, a book would be placed on a book shelf).\n\n[[File:Caja fuerte antigua.jpg|thumb|left|Strongbox multiple locking mechanism]]\nFire resistant record protection equipment consists of self-contained devices that incorporate insulated bodies, doors, drawers or lids, or non-rated multi-drawer devices housing individually rated containers that contain one or more inner compartments for storage of records. These devices are intended to provide protection to one or more types of records as evidenced by the assigned Class rating or ratings; Class 350 for paper, Class 150 for microfilm, microfiche other and photographic film and Class 125 for magnetic media and hard drives.\n\nThese types of enclosures can be rated for periods of \u00bd-, 1-, 2- and 4-hour durations.\n\nIn addition, these enclosures may be rated for their impact resistance, should the safe fall a number of feet to a lower level or have debris fall upon it during a fire.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.safes.co.uk/blog/home_safes/|title=Five reasons you need a Home Safe|last=|first=|date=|website=|language=en|access-date=2017-04-19}}</ref>\n\nBurglary resistant safes are rated as to their resistance to the type of tools to be used in their attack and also the duration of the attack.\n\nThe attack durations are for periods of 15 minutes, 30 minutes and 60 minutes.\n\nSafes can also contain hardware that automatically dispenses cash or validates bills as part of an [[automated cash handling]] system.\n\n==Room-sized fireproof vaults==\n{{see also|Bank vault}}\nFor larger volumes of heat-sensitive materials, a modular room-sized vault is much more economical than purchasing and storing many fire rated safes. Typically these room-sized vaults are utilized by corporations, government agencies and off-site storage service firms. Fireproof vaults are rated up to Class 125-4 Hour for large data storage applications. These vaults utilize ceramic fiber, a high temperature industrial insulating material, as the core of their modular panel system. All components of the vault, not just the walls and roof panels, must be Class 125 rated to achieve that overall rating for the vault. This includes the door assembly (a double door is needed since there is no single Class 125 vault door available), cable penetrations, coolant line penetrations (for split [[HVAC]] systems), and air duct penetrations.\n\nThere are also Class 150 applications (such as microfilm) and Class 350 vaults for protecting valuable paper documents. Like the data-rated (Class 125) structures, these vault systems employ ceramic fiber insulation and components rated to meet or exceed the required level of protection.\n\nIn recent years room-sized Class 125 vaults have been installed to protect entire data centers. As data storage technologies migrate from tape-based storage methods to hard drives, this trend is likely to continue.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Fire-resistant safes==\n<!-- Courtesy note per [[WP:RSECT]]. [[Fire safe]] redirects to this section. -->\n[[File:Dangerous chemicals cabinet in MPI-CBG.jpg|thumb|upright|A reinforced, fireproof cabinet for dangerous chemicals]]\nA fire-resistant safe is a type of safe that is designed to protect its contents from high temperatures or actual [[fire]]. Fire resistant safes are usually rated by the amount of time they can withstand the extreme temperatures a fire produces, while not exceeding a set internal temperature, e.g., less than {{convert|350|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}. Models are typically available between half-hour and four-hour durations.\n\nIn the UK the BS EN-1047 standard is set aside for data and document safes to determine their ability to withstand prolonged intense heat and impact damage.\n* Document safes are designed to maintain an internal temperature no greater than {{convert|177|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} while in a constantly heated environment in excess of {{convert|1000|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}.\n* Data safes are designed to maintain an internal temperature no greater than {{convert|55|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} while in a constantly heated environment in excess of {{convert|1000|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}.\nThese conditions are maintained for the duration of the test. This is usually at least 30 minutes but can extend to many hours depending on grade.\nBoth kinds of safe are also tested for impact by dropping from a set height onto a solid surface and then tested for fire survivability once again.<ref>Standard document: BS EN 1047-2:2000</ref>\n\nIn the USA, both the writing of standards for fire-resistance and the actual testing of safes is performed by [[Underwriters Laboratories]].\n\nAn in-floor safe installed in a concrete floor is very resistant to fire. However, not all floor safes are watertight and will often fill with water from fire hoses, therefore everything stored inside should be placed in either double zip lock bags, dry bags, or sealed plastic containers.\n\nReinforced, fireproof cabinets are also used for dangerous chemicals or flammable goods.\n\n==Wall safes==\nWall safes are designed to provide hidden protection for documents and miscellaneous valuables. Adjustable depth allows the maximization of usable space when installed in different wall thicknesses. Some wall safes feature pry-resistant recessed doors with concealed hinges for anti-theft protection. A painting can be hung over a wall safe to obscure it from public view.\n\n==Jewelry safes==\nJewelry safes are burglary and fire safes made specifically to house [[jewelry]] and valuables. These high end safes are typically manufactured with interior jewelry chests of fine woods and fabric liners with a range of organizational configurations.\n\n==Safe-cracking==\n{{Main|Safe-cracking}}\nSafe cracking is opening a safe without a combination or key. There are many methods to safe cracking ranging from brute force methods to guessing the combination. The easiest method that can be used on many safes is \"safe bouncing\", which involves hitting the safe on top; this may cause the locking pin to budge, opening the safe.\n\n==UL certification for safes==\n[[Underwriters Laboratories]] (UL) testing certifications for safes are known to be some of the most rigorous and most respected in the world.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} They are only matched by B.T.U/VDMA certifications (Germany).{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nJ.I.S. (Japan) and CSTB (France) preheat the oven with the safe inside until the temperature reaches the desired setting (as opposed to a sustained temperature of the rating), then the safe is cooled artificially (as opposed to naturally).{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Also, J.I.S. and CSTB only drop their safes from 13\u201315 feet (as opposed to 30). Rarely are safes dropped {{convert|15|ft|m}} or more and they are usually artificially cooled by the fire department. UL also runs an indirect explosion test on all safes. Additionally UL-768 certifies the combination lock against tampering. UL-140 certifies a relocking mechanism that will permanently lock the safe bolts, in case an electronic lock fails or a UL-768 rated lock is compromised.\n\n===Class 125===\nThe container sustains an internal atmosphere of {{convert|125|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} and 80% humidity. This class was introduced with the emergence of floppy disks. The containers are tested with only non-paper media, but are clearly sufficient to hold paper. New, more durable computer media, such as data on compact disks, crystallize at {{convert|350|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}},<ref>{{cite web|url=https://studylib.net/doc/18544005/the-compact-disc--cd--was-initially-developed-as-a|title=The Compact Disc (CD) was initially developed as a|website=studylib.net|access-date=21 May 2019}}</ref> which make this type of safe more than sufficient to store these media.\n\nHowever, [[Underwriters Laboratories]] (UL) does not state data on Blu-ray disks, DVDs or CDs. Only floppy disks, which are no longer a common storage medium, is stated.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://standardscatalog.ul.com/standards/en/standard_72|title=UL - 72 Standard for Tests for Fire Resistance of Record Protection Equipment - Standards Catalog|website=standardscatalog.ul.com|access-date=21 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nAn added benefit of this container is that it has water-resistant seal on its door.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://silvaconsultants.com/introduction-to-burglar-and-fire-safes.html|title=Introduction to Burglar and Fire Safes|website=silvaconsultants.com|access-date=21 May 2019}}</ref> However UL does not check for water resistance and all fire-insulated safes are not tightly sealed. When exposed to heat, the insulation expands and  seals all joints tightly which is supposed to keep water out. If a safe is submerged in water without any prior exposure to heat, water will seep in.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://knoxvillesafehouse.com/faq/ |title=Faqs| publisher=Knoxvillesafehouse.com}}</ref>  These class ratings are used in conjunction with hour ratings such as: \u00bd, 1, 2, 3, or 4.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.safetyfile.com/pages/ul-fire-and-impact-ratings|title=UL Fire and Impact Ratings|website=SafetyFile|access-date=21 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Class 150===\nThe container sustains an internal atmosphere less than {{convert|150|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} and 85% humidity. This class was introduced with the emergence of computer data tapes or magnetic reel-to-reel tapes. UL tests this with paper and non-paper articles. This container is also sufficient in storing some optical media, such as compact disks. Cases can be purchased that will meet Class 125, if they are placed inside a Class 150 safe. Some may be waterproof due to a gasket on the door and the label will state this. These class ratings are used in conjunction with hour ratings such as: \u00bd, 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n===Class 350===\nThe container sustains an internal atmosphere of less than {{convert|350|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} and 85% humidity. This is the most basic of U.L. tests and specifically tests for the storage of paper. The [[autoignition temperature]] of paper is about {{convert|450|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}, so this container is sufficient for storage of paper.

An example of a basic home safe with 12&nbsp;mm steel door & 6mm steel case that can be bolted to a concrete floor]]\n\nA '''safe''' (also called a '''strongbox''' or '''coffer''') is a secure [[Lock (security device)|lockable]] box used for securing valuable objects against [[theft]] and/or damage from fire. A safe is usually a hollow [[cuboid]] or cylinder, with one face being removable or [[hinge]]d to form a [[door]]. The body and door may be [[Casting (metalworking)|cast]] from [[metal]] (such as [[steel]]) or formed out of plastic through [[blow molding]]. Bank teller safes typically are secured to the counter, have a slit opening for dropping valuables into the safe without opening it, and a time-delay combination lock to foil robbers/and or thieves. One significant distinction between types of safes is whether the safe is secured to a wall or structure or if it can be moved around. A less secure version (only suitable for [[petty cash]]) is usually called a cash-box.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Chubb building modern.jpg|thumb|The Chubb Building, Fryer Street, in [[Wolverhampton]]]]\n{{Expand section|date=January 2012}}\nIn 1835, English inventors [[Charles Chubb (businessman)|Charles]] and [[Jeremiah Chubb]] in [[Wolverhampton]], [[England]], received a patent for a burglar-resisting safe and began a production of safes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chubbsafes.com/about/history/Pages/default.aspx|title=History|publisher=|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100909090849/http://www.chubbsafes.com/about/history/Pages/default.aspx|archive-date=2010-09-09|df=}}</ref> The Chubb brothers had produced locks since 1818. [[Chubb Locks]] was an independent company until 2000 when it was sold to [[Assa Abloy]].\n\nOn November 2, 1886, inventor [[Henry Brown (inventor)|Henry Brown]] patented a \"receptacle for storing and preserving papers\". The container was fire retardant and accident resistant as it was made from forged metal. The box was able to be safely secured with a lock and key and also able to maintain organization by offering different slots to organize important papers.<ref name=\"About\">{{cite web | author= | year=2011 | title=Henry Brown | work=Inventors | publisher=[[About.com]] | url=http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blbrown.htm | access-date=9 March 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"Bio\">{{cite web | author= | year=2011 | title=Little Known Facts | work=Black History Inventions and Discoveries | publisher=[[Biography.com]] | url=http://www.biography.com/tv/classroom/black-history-inventions-and-discoveries | access-date=13 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Specifications==\nSpecifications for safes include some or all of the following parameters:\n* Burglar-resistance\n* Fire-resistance\n* Environmental resistance (e.g., to water or dust)\n* Type of lock (e.g., [[Combination lock|combination]], key, [[time lock]], [[electronic lock]]ing)\n* Location (e.g., wall safe, floor safe)\n* Smart safes as part of an [[automated cash handling]] system\n\nIt is often possible to open a safe without access to the [[Key (lock)|key]] or knowledge of the combination; this activity is known as [[safe-cracking]] and is a popular theme in [[heist film]]s.\n\nA [[diversion safe]], or hidden safe, is a safe that is made from an otherwise ordinary object such as a book, a candle, a can, or even a wall outlet plug. Valuables are placed in these hidden safes, which are themselves [[Security through obscurity|placed inconspicuously]] (for example, a book would be placed on a book shelf).\n\n[[File:Caja fuerte antigua.jpg|thumb|left|Strongbox multiple locking mechanism]]\nFire resistant record protection equipment consists of self-contained devices that incorporate insulated bodies, doors, drawers or lids, or non-rated multi-drawer devices housing individually rated containers that contain one or more inner compartments for storage of records. These devices are intended to provide protection to one or more types of records as evidenced by the assigned Class rating or ratings; Class 350 for paper, Class 150 for microfilm, microfiche other and photographic film and Class 125 for magnetic media and hard drives.\n\nThese types of enclosures can be rated for periods of \u00bd-, 1-, 2- and 4-hour durations.\n\nIn addition, these enclosures may be rated for their impact resistance, should the safe fall a number of feet to a lower level or have debris fall upon it during a fire.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.safes.co.uk/blog/home_safes/|title=Five reasons you need a Home Safe|last=|first=|date=|website=|language=en|access-date=2017-04-19}}</ref>\n\nBurglary resistant safes are rated as to their resistance to the type of tools to be used in their attack and also the duration of the attack.\n\nThe attack durations are for periods of 15 minutes, 30 minutes and 60 minutes.\n\nSafes can also contain hardware that automatically dispenses cash or validates bills as part of an [[automated cash handling]] system.\n\n==Room-sized fireproof vaults==\n{{see also|Bank vault}}\nFor larger volumes of heat-sensitive materials, a modular room-sized vault is much more economical than purchasing and storing many fire rated safes. Typically these room-sized vaults are utilized by corporations, government agencies and off-site storage service firms. Fireproof vaults are rated up to Class 125-4 Hour for large data storage applications. These vaults utilize ceramic fiber, a high temperature industrial insulating material, as the core of their modular panel system. All components of the vault, not just the walls and roof panels, must be Class 125 rated to achieve that overall rating for the vault. This includes the door assembly (a double door is needed since there is no single Class 125 vault door available), cable penetrations, coolant line penetrations (for split [[HVAC]] systems), and air duct penetrations.\n\nThere are also Class 150 applications (such as microfilm) and Class 350 vaults for protecting valuable paper documents. Like the data-rated (Class 125) structures, these vault systems employ ceramic fiber insulation and components rated to meet or exceed the required level of protection.\n\nIn recent years room-sized Class 125 vaults have been installed to protect entire data centers. As data storage technologies migrate from tape-based storage methods to hard drives, this trend is likely to continue.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Fire-resistant safes==\n<!-- Courtesy note per [[WP:RSECT]]. [[Fire safe]] redirects to this section. -->\n[[File:Dangerous chemicals cabinet in MPI-CBG.jpg|thumb|upright|A reinforced, fireproof cabinet for dangerous chemicals]]\nA fire-resistant safe is a type of safe that is designed to protect its contents from high temperatures or actual [[fire]]. Fire resistant safes are usually rated by the amount of time they can withstand the extreme temperatures a fire produces, while not exceeding a set internal temperature, e.g., less than {{convert|350|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}. Models are typically available between half-hour and four-hour durations.\n\nIn the UK the BS EN-1047 standard is set aside for data and document safes to determine their ability to withstand prolonged intense heat and impact damage.\n* Document safes are designed to maintain an internal temperature no greater than {{convert|177|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} while in a constantly heated environment in excess of {{convert|1000|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}.\n* Data safes are designed to maintain an internal temperature no greater than {{convert|55|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} while in a constantly heated environment in excess of {{convert|1000|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}.\nThese conditions are maintained for the duration of the test. This is usually at least 30 minutes but can extend to many hours depending on grade.\nBoth kinds of safe are also tested for impact by dropping from a set height onto a solid surface and then tested for fire survivability once again.<ref>Standard document: BS EN 1047-2:2000</ref>\n\nIn the USA, both the writing of standards for fire-resistance and the actual testing of safes is performed by [[Underwriters Laboratories]].\n\nAn in-floor safe installed in a concrete floor is very resistant to fire. However, not all floor safes are watertight and will often fill with water from fire hoses, therefore everything stored inside should be placed in either double zip lock bags, dry bags, or sealed plastic containers.\n\nReinforced, fireproof cabinets are also used for dangerous chemicals or flammable goods.\n\n==Wall safes==\nWall safes are designed to provide hidden protection for documents and miscellaneous valuables. Adjustable depth allows the maximization of usable space when installed in different wall thicknesses. Some wall safes feature pry-resistant recessed doors with concealed hinges for anti-theft protection. A painting can be hung over a wall safe to obscure it from public view.\n\n==Jewelry safes==\nJewelry safes are burglary and fire safes made specifically to house [[jewelry]] and valuables. These high end safes are typically manufactured with interior jewelry chests of fine woods and fabric liners with a range of organizational configurations.\n\n==Safe-cracking==\n{{Main|Safe-cracking}}\nSafe cracking is opening a safe without a combination or key. There are many methods to safe cracking ranging from brute force methods to guessing the combination. The easiest method that can be used on many safes is \"safe bouncing\", which involves hitting the safe on top; this may cause the locking pin to budge, opening the safe.\n\n==UL certification for safes==\n[[Underwriters Laboratories]] (UL) testing certifications for safes are known to be some of the most rigorous and most respected in the world.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} They are only matched by B.T.U/VDMA certifications (Germany).{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nJ.I.S. (Japan) and CSTB (France) preheat the oven with the safe inside until the temperature reaches the desired setting (as opposed to a sustained temperature of the rating), then the safe is cooled artificially (as opposed to naturally).{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Also, J.I.S. and CSTB only drop their safes from 13\u201315 feet (as opposed to 30). Rarely are safes dropped {{convert|15|ft|m}} or more and they are usually artificially cooled by the fire department. UL also runs an indirect explosion test on all safes. Additionally UL-768 certifies the combination lock against tampering. UL-140 certifies a relocking mechanism that will permanently lock the safe bolts, in case an electronic lock fails or a UL-768 rated lock is compromised.\n\n===Class 125===\nThe container sustains an internal atmosphere of {{convert|125|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} and 80% humidity. This class was introduced with the emergence of floppy disks. The containers are tested with only non-paper media, but are clearly sufficient to hold paper. New, more durable computer media, such as data on compact disks, crystallize at {{convert|350|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}},<ref>{{cite web|url=https://studylib.net/doc/18544005/the-compact-disc--cd--was-initially-developed-as-a|title=The Compact Disc (CD) was initially developed as a|website=studylib.net|access-date=21 May 2019}}</ref> which make this type of safe more than sufficient to store these media.\n\nHowever, [[Underwriters Laboratories]] (UL) does not state data on Blu-ray disks, DVDs or CDs. Only floppy disks, which are no longer a common storage medium, is stated.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://standardscatalog.ul.com/standards/en/standard_72|title=UL - 72 Standard for Tests for Fire Resistance of Record Protection Equipment - Standards Catalog|website=standardscatalog.ul.com|access-date=21 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nAn added benefit of this container is that it has water-resistant seal on its door.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://silvaconsultants.com/introduction-to-burglar-and-fire-safes.html|title=Introduction to Burglar and Fire Safes|website=silvaconsultants.com|access-date=21 May 2019}}</ref> However UL does not check for water resistance and all fire-insulated safes are not tightly sealed. When exposed to heat, the insulation expands and  seals all joints tightly which is supposed to keep water out.

This class was introduced with the emergence of computer data tapes or magnetic reel-to-reel tapes. UL tests this with paper and non-paper articles. This container is also sufficient in storing some optical media, such as compact disks. Cases can be purchased that will meet Class 125, if they are placed inside a Class 150 safe. Some may be waterproof due to a gasket on the door and the label will state this. These class ratings are used in conjunction with hour ratings such as: \u00bd, 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n===Class 350===\nThe container sustains an internal atmosphere of less than {{convert|350|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} and 85% humidity. This is the most basic of U.L. tests and specifically tests for the storage of paper. The [[autoignition temperature]] of paper is about {{convert|450|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}, so this container is sufficient for storage of paper. Cases can be purchased that will meet Class 125, if they are placed inside a Class 350 container.
