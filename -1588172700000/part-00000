Eleven teams, from three countries participated. The final table was dominated by the Irish, with the top three spots taken by Ulster, Leinster and Munster respectively. The 2005\u201306 season was the first (and last) season for which the \"free weekend\" was awarded points for. Due to the odd number of teams participating, for every round of fixtures, one team has a so-called \"free weekend\". Each time this occurred, the team was awarded four points, so although at the end of the season it did not alter the positions (each team has a guaranteed 8 points), the table is skewed during the season according to the fixtures.\n\n==Teams==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; margin: 1em auto;\"\n|-\n|\n{{Location map+ |United Kingdom|AlternativeMap=United Kingdom location

Eleven teams, from three countries participated. The final table was dominated by the Irish, with the top three spots taken by Ulster, Leinster and Munster respectively. The 2005\u201306 season was the first (and last) season for which the \"free weekend\" was awarded points for. Due to the odd number of teams participating, for every round of fixtures, one team has a so-called \"free weekend\". Each time this occurred, the team was awarded four points, so although at the end of the season it did not alter the positions (each team has a guaranteed 8 points), the table is skewed during the season according to the fixtures.\n\n==Teams==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; margin: 1em auto;\"\n|-\n|\n{{Location map+ |United Kingdom|AlternativeMap=United Kingdom location

However, it had a predecessor, the \"Institut f\u00fcr Physikalische Grundlagen der Medizin\" which had been established in 1921 by [[Friedrich Dessauer]], an admirer of Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen, who endeavored to apply radiation physics to medicine and biology. Being a conservative member of parliament for the democratic \"Zentrumspartei\", Dessauer opposed the National Socialists' rise to power and was then forced to emigrate in 1934. His successor, Dessauer's colleague and long-standing collaborator, [[Boris Rajewsky]] was the first director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Biophysics. Rajewsky firstly coined the term \"Biophysics\" and consequently the institute became one of the first to be known by this name. Research has been conducted primarily on the effects of radioactive radiation on humans and possible medical use, as well as on aerosols.\n\nAfter the Second World War, the institute was reopened in 1948 as the \"Max Planck Institute of Biophysics\". With the retirement of Boris Rajewsky in 1966 and the appointment of Reinhard Schl\u00f6gl in 1965, the research work was oriented away from work with radioactive radiation towards the investigation of \"mass transport through biological and artificial membranes\". With the subsequent appointment of Karl Julius Ullrich in 1967 and finally Hermann Passow in 1968 as new directors of the institute, the management of the Max Planck Institute of Biophysics also developed away from the classic one-director institute to a more modern board of directors. The main focus of research was (and still is) the investigation of the cell membrane and its building blocks, the membrane proteins (and especially the transport proteins). The cell membranes and the proteins were and are being investigated using the most modern physical methods available at the time, including\n\n- X-ray crystallography\n\n- high-resolution electron microscopy\n\n- Spectroscopy\n\nThis development was initiated, especially after the retirement of Passow and Ullrich in 1993 and Schl\u00f6gl in 1996, by the appointment of a new generation of directors, in 1987 by Hartmut Michel (Dept. of Molecular Membrane Biology), in 1993 by Ernst Bamberg (Dept. of Biophysical Chemistry) and in 1996 by Werner K\u00fchlbrandt (Dept. of Structural Biology).\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe functional new building of the MPIBP on the Riedberg university campus is divided into two halves by an entrance hall running continuously in an east-west direction. The laboratories and other research facilities of the institute are located in the northern half, while the offices and meeting rooms of the scientists and the administration are located in the southern half from the first floor onwards. For fast communication, the two halves are connected by bridges spanning the entrance hall.

The film stars [[Steve Martin]] as Neal Page, a high-strung marketing executive, and [[John Candy]] as Del Griffith, a goodhearted but annoying shower [[curtain ring]] salesman. They share a three-day odyssey of misadventures trying to get Neal home to Chicago in time for [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] with his family.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Planes trains automobiles route map.gif|thumb|right|Route taken by Del Griffith and Neal Page in the film]]\nNeal Page is a marketing [[account executive]] aka ad executive on a business trip in New York City, eager to return to his family in Chicago for Thanksgiving, which is in two days. After attending a tedious business meeting that ends without a decision, Neal unsuccessfully attempts to hail a cab during rush hour. He is further delayed after paying a greedy attorney for a cab that is inadvertently stolen by Del Griffith, a loquacious traveling salesman who sells shower curtain rings. Neal and Del cross paths again at [[LaGuardia International Airport|LaGuardia Airport]], where they board a plane to [[O'Hare International Airport|O'Hare]]. Their plane is diverted to [[Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport|Wichita]] due to a blizzard in Chicago.\n\nNeal discovers that because of the adverse weather he is stuck in Wichita, and no hotel rooms are  available. Del manages to book a room and Neal accompanies him to an aging, somewhat ramshackle motel. During the night, Neal loses his temper with Del and lambasts him for being annoying and  all the trouble he has caused him. In response, Del admits that he can be annoying and regards Neal as a cold cynic; and despite how Neal feels, he likes himself and his wife and customers like him. Neal calms down and the two men go back to bed. As they sleep, a burglar breaks into the room and steals all their cash.\n\nThe following day, they attempt to reach Chicago by train. To Neal's relief, their assigned seats are in separate cars and they say goodbye prior to boarding. En route, the locomotive breaks down, stranding the passengers in a Missouri field where Del and Neal are reunited. After they reach [[Jefferson City, Missouri|Jefferson City]], Del raises cash by selling shower curtain rings to passersby, advertising the items as jewelry. Del uses the funds to buy bus tickets. After arriving in St. Louis, Neal inadvertently offends Del over lunch and the two part ways again.\n\nAt the [[St. Louis Lambert International Airport|St. Louis airport]], Neal attempts to rent a car, but finds the space at the distant rental lot empty. After a long and perilous walk across a highway and the airport runway, Neal arrives back at the terminal and vents his anger with a profanity-laced tirade at the rental agent to no avail. In desperation, he attempts to hire a taxi to Chicago, but insults the dispatcher, who then punches Neal. By chance, Del arrives with his own rental car just in time to rescue Neal. While driving, they find themselves arguing again. The situation is made worse when Del nearly gets them killed on a freeway after [[wrong-way driving|driving in the wrong direction]], scraping between two oncoming semi trailer trucks.\n\nWhile they take a moment to compose themselves by the side of the road, Del's carelessly discarded cigarette sets fire to the car's interior. Neal initially gloats, thinking that Del is liable for the damage. Neal's amusement turns to anger when Del reveals he used Neal's credit card to rent the car after their cards were accidentally switched.\n\nWith his credit cards destroyed in the fire, Neal barters his expensive [[Piaget SA|Piaget]] watch for a motel room for himself. Del is broke and attempts to sleep in the car, which has lost its roof in the fire. Neal eventually feels sympathy for Del and invites him in from the cold and snowy night. They consume Del's collection of [[Miniature (alcohol)|airline liquors]] and laugh about the events of the past two days. The pair resume driving to Chicago the next morning, but are stopped for speeding by a state trooper and  their fire damaged car is declared unsafe and is impounded. Del manages to get them a ride in the back of a refrigerator truck and the pair finally make it to Chicago, two days late.\n\nNeal and Del finally part ways at a [[Chicago \"L\"]] [[LaSalle/Van Buren (CTA station)|station]]. On the train home, Neal reminisces about the wild events of the past few days and begins to laugh.

They share a three-day odyssey of misadventures trying to get Neal home to Chicago in time for [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] with his family.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Planes trains automobiles route map.gif|thumb|right|Route taken by Del Griffith and Neal Page in the film]]\nNeal Page is a marketing [[account executive]] on a business trip in New York City, eager to return to his family in Chicago for Thanksgiving, which is in two days. After attending a tedious business meeting that ends without a decision, Neal unsuccessfully attempts to hail a cab during rush hour. He is further delayed after paying a greedy attorney for a cab that is inadvertently stolen by Del Griffith, a loquacious traveling salesman who sells shower curtain rings. Neal and Del cross paths again at [[LaGuardia International Airport|LaGuardia Airport]], where they board a plane to [[O'Hare International Airport|O'Hare]]. Their plane is diverted to [[Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport|Wichita]] due to a blizzard in Chicago.\n\nNeal discovers that because of the adverse weather he is stuck in Wichita, and no hotel rooms are  available. Del manages to book a room and Neal accompanies him to an aging, somewhat ramshackle motel. During the night, Neal loses his temper with Del and lambasts him for being annoying and  all the trouble he has caused him. In response, Del admits that he can be annoying and regards Neal as a cold cynic; and despite how Neal feels, he likes himself and his wife and customers like him. Neal calms down and the two men go back to bed. As they sleep, a burglar breaks into the room and steals all their cash.\n\nThe following day, they attempt to reach Chicago by train. To Neal's relief, their assigned seats are in separate cars and they say goodbye prior to boarding. En route, the locomotive breaks down, stranding the passengers in a Missouri field where Del and Neal are reunited. After they reach [[Jefferson City, Missouri|Jefferson City]], Del raises cash by selling shower curtain rings to passersby, advertising the items as jewelry. Del uses the funds to buy bus tickets. After arriving in St. Louis, Neal inadvertently offends Del over lunch and the two part ways again.\n\nAt the [[St. Louis Lambert International Airport|St. Louis airport]], Neal attempts to rent a car, but finds the space at the distant rental lot empty. After a long and perilous walk across a highway and the airport runway, Neal arrives back at the terminal and vents his anger with a profanity-laced tirade at the rental agent to no avail. In desperation, he attempts to hire a taxi to Chicago, but insults the dispatcher, who then punches Neal. By chance, Del arrives with his own rental car just in time to rescue Neal. While driving, they find themselves arguing again. The situation is made worse when Del nearly gets them killed on a freeway after [[wrong-way driving|driving in the wrong direction]], scraping between two oncoming semi trailer trucks.\n\nWhile they take a moment to compose themselves by the side of the road, Del's carelessly discarded cigarette sets fire to the car's interior. Neal initially gloats, thinking that Del is liable for the damage. Neal's amusement turns to anger when Del reveals he used Neal's credit card to rent the car after their cards were accidentally switched.\n\nWith his credit cards destroyed in the fire, Neal barters his expensive [[Piaget SA|Piaget]] watch for a motel room for himself. Del is broke and attempts to sleep in the car, which has lost its roof in the fire. Neal eventually feels sympathy for Del and invites him in from the cold and snowy night. They consume Del's collection of [[Miniature (alcohol)|airline liquors]] and laugh about the events of the past two days. The pair resume driving to Chicago the next morning, but are stopped for speeding by a state trooper and  their fire damaged car is declared unsafe and is impounded. Del manages to get them a ride in the back of a refrigerator truck and the pair finally make it to Chicago, two days late.\n\nNeal and Del finally part ways at a [[Chicago \"L\"]] [[LaSalle/Van Buren (CTA station)|station]]. On the train home, Neal reminisces about the wild events of the past few days and begins to laugh. He remembers cryptic comments Del made during the journey and realizes that he may be alone for the holiday. Struck by compassion, Neal quickly returns to the station, finds Del sitting alone and asks why he has not gone home. Del reveals that he does not have a home and that his wife died eight years earlier. \n\nNeal returns home to his family and introduces them to Del, whom he has invited to Thanksgiving dinner.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Steve Martin]] as Neal Page\n* [[John Candy]] as Del Griffith\n* [[Laila Robins]] as Susan Page\n* [[Michael McKean]] as State Trooper\n* [[Kevin Bacon]] as Taxi Racer\n* [[Dylan Baker]] as Owen\n* Lulie Newcomb as Owen's wife\n* [[Olivia Burnette]] as Marti Page\n* [[Larry Hankin]] as Doobie\n* [[Richard Herd]] as Walt\n* [[Matthew Lawrence]] as Neal Page, Jr.\n* [[Edie McClurg]] as Car Rental Agent\n* [[Bill Erwin]] as Man on Plane\n* [[Ben Stein]] as Wichita airport representative\n* [[Diana Douglas|Diana Dill]] as Peg\n* [[Charles Tyner]] as Gus Mooney\n* [[Martin Ferrero]] as 2nd Motel Clerk\n}}\n\n==Production==\n''Planes, Train and Automobiles'' was filmed in 85 days,<ref name = \"ProVideo\">{{cite web|last=Hullfish|first=Steve|date=April 13, 2019|url=https://www.provideocoalition.com/art-of-the-cut-with-oscar-winner-paul-hirsch-ace/|title=ART OF THE CUT with Oscar winner, Paul Hirsch, ACE|website=Pro Video Coalition|accessdate=November 25, 2019}}</ref> mostly in [[Batavia, New York]] and [[South Dayton, New York]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Marcia|last=Greenwood|url=https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/lifestyle/2017/11/22/planes-trains-and-automobiles-filmed-batavia-1987/888031001/ |title=Planes, Trains and Automobiles filmed in Batavia: Behind the scenes |newspaper=[[Democrat and Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|location=Rochester, New York|date=November 22, 2017|accessdate=March 4, 2019}}</ref> A scene that takes place in St. Louis was filmed at [[Lambert International Airport]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fox2now.com/2014/07/17/5-movies-with-locations-in-st-louis/|title=5 Movies With Locations in St. Louis|date=July 17, 2014|website=FOX2now.com|language=en|access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c2tZY-i6aa8C&pg=PA104&lpg=PA104&dq=%22planes+trains+and+automobiles%22+filmed+in+st+louis+airport&source=bl&ots=b05iqtER01&sig=ACfU3U1pFHC4ZuMV4dB8aToQHugdBCkWrQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjdvMn9rYfjAhWUB50JHXjWAS84FBDoATAGegQICRAB#v=onepage&q=%22planes%20trains%20and%20automobiles%22%20filmed%20in%20st%20louis%20airport&f=false|title=Shot on This Site: A Traveler's Guide to the Places and Locations Used to Film Famous Movies and TV Shows|last=Gordon|first=William A.|date=1995|publisher=Citadel Press|isbn=9780806516479|language=en}}</ref> Rewrites Hughes did during filming made the amount of footage he shot much larger than what the original screenplay needed.<ref name = \"ProVideo\"/>\n== Themes ==\nArgun Ulgen categorized ''Planes, Trains, and Automobiles'' as a lively portrayal of in-person interactions between people of different economic classes: \"people curse, make out in public, speak in platitudes, and retell the same jokes; generally, they are coarse and loud, imperfect, but not without love.\"<ref name = \"Popmatters\">{{cite web|last=Ulgen|first=Argun|date=November 14, 2017|url=https://www.popmatters.com/planes-trains-and-automobiles-celebrates-its-30th-anniversary-at-a-time-we-need-the-film-the-most-2508407785.html|title='Planes, Trains and Automobiles' Celebrates Its 30th Anniversary at a Time We Need It Most|website=[[PopMatters]]|accessdate=November 26, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe film marked a widely noticed change in the repertoire of John Hughes.<ref>{{cite news|first=Jack|last=Mathews|title='PTA' Transports John Hughes Beyond His Teen Comedy Image|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-12-15-ca-29192-story.html|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tronc]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=December 15, 1987|page=1}}</ref> It was greeted with critical acclaim upon release, a revelation in that Hughes was considered a teen [[angst]] filmmaker.<ref name=\"Jay Carr 1987. pg. 34\">{{cite news|first=Jay|last=Carr|title='PLANES, TRAINS' NEVER GETS OFF THE GROUND|newspaper=[[Boston Globe]]|publisher=Boston Globe Partners, L.P.|location=Boston, Massachusetts|date=November 25, 1987|page=34}}</ref> It also got two thumbs up from ''[[Siskel & Ebert]]'', with [[Gene Siskel]] declaring it John Candy's best role to date. \n\nIt has 91% positive ratings on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] from 56 reviews.
