The District of Columbia is a [[federal district]] under the direct jurisdiction of the [[United States Congress]]. Statehood would grant the District [[District of Columbia voting rights|voting representation]] in the Congress and [[District of Columbia home rule|full control over local affairs]].

However, there is some debate as to whether simple legislation would be sufficient to grant statehood to District of Columbia, which is the [[seat of government|seat of the United States federal government]].\n\nIf the District of Columbia were to become a state \u2013 based on 2018 figures \u2013 it would rank [[List of states and territories of the United States by population|49th by population]], [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|51st by area]], [[List of U.S. states by GDP per capita|1st by GDP per capita]], [[List of U.S. states and territories by income|1st by median household income]], and [[List of U.S. states and territories by GDP|34th by total GDP]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:US flag 51 stars.svg|thumb|The [[United States Army Institute of Heraldry|U.S. Army Institute of Heraldry]] has designed this 51-star version of the national flag for use in the event that a [[51st state]] is admitted into the Union.]]\n\n===District Clause of the Constitution===\nIn 1783, a crowd of disbanded Revolutionary War soldiers angry about not having been paid gathered to [[Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783|protest outside the building]] where the [[Continental Congress]] was meeting in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. The soldiers blocked the door and initially refused to allow the delegates to leave. Despite requests from the Congress, the Pennsylvania state government declined to call out its militia to deal with the unruly mob, and so Congress was forced to abruptly adjourn to New Jersey.\n\nThis led to the widespread belief that Congress needed control over the national capital. As [[James Madison]] wrote in The Federalist No. 43, \"Without it, not only the public authority might be insulted and its proceedings interrupted with impunity; but a dependence of the members of the general government on the State comprehending the seat of the government, for protection in the exercise of their duty, might bring on the national councils an imputation of awe or influence, equally dishonorable to the government and dissatisfactory to the other members of the Confederacy.\" This belief resulted in the creation of a national capital, separate from any state, by the Constitution's District Clause.<ref>{{cite book |title=District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2007: Hearing Notes |date=March 14, 2007 |publisher=DIANE publishing |isbn=978-1-4223-2085-3 |page=23 }}<!--|accessdate=November 17, 2015--></ref>\n\nThe \"District Clause\" in [[Bankruptcy Clause (United States Constitution)|Article I, Section 8, Clause 17]] of the [[United States Constitution]] states:{{quote|[The Congress shall have Power] To exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever, over such District (not exceeding ten miles square) as may, by cession of particular states, and the acceptance of Congress, become the seat of the government of the United States.}}\n\nHowever, Madison further wrote in Federalist 43 that the residents of the new federal district \"will have had their voice in the election of the government which is to exercise authority over them.\"  Madison did not elaborate as to how this would be but even with a then unidentified parcel suggested that the principles of self-government would not be absent in the capital of the Republic.\n\n===Early discussions of voting rights===\nIn 1788, the land on which the District is formed was ceded by [[Maryland]]. In 1790, Congress passed the [[Residence Act]] placing the District on the [[Potomac River]] between the Anacostia and Connogochegue with the exact location chosen by President Washington. His selection was announced on January 24, 1791, and the Residence Act was amended to include land that [[Virginia]] had ceded in 1790. That land was [[District of Columbia retrocession#Virginia retrocession|returned to Virginia]] in 1847. The [[United States Congress|Congress]] did not officially move to the new federal capital until the first Monday in December 1800. During that time the District was governed by a combination of a federally appointed Board of Commissioners, the state legislatures and locally elected governments.<ref name=Seat/>\n\nWithin a year of moving to the District, Congress passed the [[District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801]] and incorporated the new federal District under its sole authority as permitted by the District Clause. Since the District of Columbia was no longer part of any state, the District's residents lost voting representation in Congress and the Electoral College as well as a voice in Constitutional Amendments and the right to home rule, facts that did not go without protest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abanet.org/poladv/letters/electionlaw/060914testimony_dcvoting.pdf|title=Statement on the subject of The District of Columbia Fair and Equal Voting Rights Acts|accessdate=July 10, 2008|date=September 14, 2006|publisher=[[American Bar Association]]}}</ref> In January 1801, a meeting of District citizens was held which resulted in a statement to Congress noting that as a result of the impending Organic Act \"we shall be completely disfranchised in respect to the national government, while we retain no security for participating in the formation of even the most minute local regulations by which we are to be affected.

In 1801, [[Augustus Woodward]] writing under the name Epaminondes, wrote a series of newspaper articles in the National Intelligencer proposing a constitutional amendment that would read \"The Territory of Columbia shall be entitled to one Senator in the Senate of the United States; and to a number of members in the House of Representatives proportionate to its population.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Woodward|first1=Augustus|title=Considerations on the government of the Territory of Columbia : as they appeared in the National intelligencer|date=1801|publisher=Samuel Harrison Smith|location=Washington, DC}}</ref> Since then more than 150 constitutional amendments  and bills have been introduced to provide representation to the District of Columbia, resulting in congressional hearings on more than twenty occasions, with the first of those hearings in 1803.<ref name=Hatch>{{cite journal|last1=Hatch|first1=Orrin|title=Should the Capital Vote in Congress?

Citizens fearful that the seat of government be moved asked that DC be given a territorial government and an amendment to the Constitution for equal rights. But James Holland of North Carolina argued that creating a territorial government would leave citizens dissatisfied. He said, \"the next step will be a request to be admitted as a member of the Union, and, if you pursue the practice relative to territories, you must, so soon as their numbers will authorize it, admit them into the Union.\"<ref>Congressional Record, 1805: 979\u2013980.</ref>\n\n===Late 19th and early 20th century===\nThe first proposal for congressional representation to get serious consideration came in 1888, but it wouldn't be until 1921 that congressional hearings would be held on the subject. Those hearings resulted in the first bill, introduced by Sen. [[Wesley Livsey Jones]] (R-WA), to be reported out of committee that would have addressed District representation. The bill would have enabled - though not required \u2013 Congress to treat residents of DC as though they were citizens of a state.\n\n===Civil rights era and the 23rd Amendment, 1950s\u20131970s===\nCongressional members continued to propose amendments to address the District's lack of representation, with efforts picking up as part of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the late 1950s. This eventually resulted in successful passage of the [[Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-third Amendment]] in 1961, which granted the District votes in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] in proportion to their size as if they were a state, but no more than the least populous state. This right has been exercised by D.C. citizens since the [[1964 United States presidential election|presidential election of 1964]].\n\nWith District citizens still denied full suffrage, members continued to propose bills to address congressional representation. Such bills made it out of committee in 1967 and 1972, for a House floor for a vote in 1976 and in 1978 resulted in the formal proposal of the [[District of Columbia Voting Rights Amendment]]. But that amendment expired in 1985, 22 ratifications short of the needed 38.\n\n===Statehood movement, 1980s and beyond===\n[[File:DC statehood now flag at Inauguration 2013.jpg|thumb|DC Statehood Now! flag at [[Second inauguration of Barack Obama|Inauguration 2013]]]]\n\nBefore the failure of the Voting Rights Amendment, but when passage seemed unlikely, District voters finally began to pursue statehood.

The soldiers blocked the door and initially refused to allow the delegates to leave. Despite requests from the Congress, the Pennsylvania state government declined to call out its militia to deal with the unruly mob, and so Congress was forced to abruptly adjourn to New Jersey.\n\nThis led to the widespread belief that Congress needed control over the national capital. As [[James Madison]] wrote in The Federalist No. 43, \"Without it, not only the public authority might be insulted and its proceedings interrupted with impunity; but a dependence of the members of the general government on the State comprehending the seat of the government, for protection in the exercise of their duty, might bring on the national councils an imputation of awe or influence, equally dishonorable to the government and dissatisfactory to the other members of the Confederacy.\" This belief resulted in the creation of a national capital, separate from any state, by the Constitution's District Clause.<ref>{{cite book |title=District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2007: Hearing Notes |date=March 14, 2007 |publisher=DIANE publishing |isbn=978-1-4223-2085-3 |page=23 }}<!--|accessdate=November 17, 2015--></ref>\n\nThe \"District Clause\" in [[Bankruptcy Clause (United States Constitution)|Article I, Section 8, Clause 17]] of the [[United States Constitution]] states:{{quote|[The Congress shall have Power] To exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever, over such District (not exceeding ten miles square) as may, by cession of particular states, and the acceptance of Congress, become the seat of the government of the United States.}}\n\nHowever, Madison further wrote in Federalist 43 that the residents of the new federal district \"will have had their voice in the election of the government which is to exercise authority over them.\"  Madison did not elaborate as to how this would be but even with a then unidentified parcel suggested that the principles of self-government would not be absent in the capital of the Republic.\n\n===Early discussions of voting rights===\nIn 1788, the land on which the District is formed was ceded by [[Maryland]]. In 1790, Congress passed the [[Residence Act]] placing the District on the [[Potomac River]] between the Anacostia and Connogochegue with the exact location chosen by President Washington. His selection was announced on January 24, 1791, and the Residence Act was amended to include land that [[Virginia]] had ceded in 1790.

During that time the District was governed by a combination of a federally appointed Board of Commissioners, the state legislatures and locally elected governments.<ref name=Seat/>\n\nWithin a year of moving to the District, Congress passed the [[District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801]] and incorporated the new federal District under its sole authority as permitted by the District Clause. Since the District of Columbia was no longer part of any state, the District's residents lost voting representation in Congress and the Electoral College as well as a voice in Constitutional Amendments and the right to home rule, facts that did not go without protest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abanet.org/poladv/letters/electionlaw/060914testimony_dcvoting.pdf|title=Statement on the subject of The District of Columbia Fair and Equal Voting Rights Acts|accessdate=July 10, 2008|date=September 14, 2006|publisher=[[American Bar Association]]}}</ref> In January 1801, a meeting of District citizens was held which resulted in a statement to Congress noting that as a result of the impending Organic Act \"we shall be completely disfranchised in respect to the national government, while we retain no security for participating in the formation of even the most minute local regulations by which we are to be affected.

But James Holland of North Carolina argued that creating a territorial government would leave citizens dissatisfied. He said, \"the next step will be a request to be admitted as a member of the Union, and, if you pursue the practice relative to territories, you must, so soon as their numbers will authorize it, admit them into the Union.\"<ref>Congressional Record, 1805: 979\u2013980.</ref>\n\n===Late 19th and early 20th century===\nThe first proposal for congressional representation to get serious consideration came in 1888, but it wouldn't be until 1921 that congressional hearings would be held on the subject.

The bill would have enabled - though not required \u2013 Congress to treat residents of DC as though they were citizens of a state.\n\n===Civil rights era and the 23rd Amendment, 1950s\u20131970s===\nCongressional members continued to propose amendments to address the District's lack of representation, with efforts picking up as part of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the late 1950s.

This right has been exercised by D.C. citizens since the [[1964 United States presidential election|presidential election of 1964]].\n\nWith District citizens still denied full suffrage, members continued to propose bills to address congressional representation. Such bills made it out of committee in 1967 and 1972, for a House floor for a vote in 1976 and in 1978 resulted in the formal proposal of the [[District of Columbia Voting Rights Amendment]].

This is inconsistent with being on equal footing with all other states. The statehood legislation supported by the District government and some House Democrats gets around this by carving out an [[enclave]] within the proposed state, encompassing the [[White House]], [[United States Capitol|Capitol Building]], [[United States Supreme Court Building|Supreme Court Building]], and other major federal offices, to act as the new District of Columbia for constitutional purposes.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://statehood.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/statehood/page_content/attachments/HR-1291.pdf |title=H.

Specifically it asserts that reality exists as the summation of social perceptions and expression; and that the reality which is perceived is the only reality worth consideration. This is accompanied by the corollaries that any perceived reality is valid, that reality is subject to manipulation via control over social perceptions and expressions.\n\nThe social constructionist movement emerged in relation to both criticism and rejection of [[Objectivism]] developed by Russian-American writer [[Ayn Rand]]. Specifically, in the assumption of a positivist basis for knowledge; which is to say that social constructionism rejects the notion that empirical facts can be known about reality, where as objectivism is defined by it. Though not explicitly reliant on it, much literature on the subject of social constructionism focuses on its relationship in many facets to hierarchy and power. This intimacy demonstrates the close inspirational source of [[Marxism|Marxist]] doctrine, as utilized in the works of Foucault and his writings on discourse.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/fouc-pol/|title=Foucault, Michel: Political Thought {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>\n\nThe work [[The Blank Slate]] of Harvard psychologist [[Steven Pinker]], the demonstrate the existence of socially constructed categories such as \"money, [[tenure]], [[citizenship]], decorations for bravery, and the presidency of the United States.\" which \"exist only because people tacitly agree to act as if they exist.\" However, they are not a support of the Social Constructionism as the principle lens through which to understand reality, but rather a specific context for particular social phenomena. Instead, the autonomy and biologically informed nature of human existence.<ref>{{cite book | last = Pinker | first = Steven | author-link = Steven Pinker | chapter = In touch with reality | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=G3_UAeo8Dh0C&pg=PA310 | title = The blank slate: the modern denial of human nature | page = 202 | publisher = Allen Lane, Penguin Books | location = London | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780713996722 }}</ref> In this manner, Pinker explicitly contradicts social constructionist scholars Marecek, Crawford & Popp in \"On the Construction of Gender, Sex, and Sexualities\", who deny the autonomy of the individual, as well as assert a variation of the [[Tabula rasa]] theory of thinking, in that knowledge and meaning are generated exclusively as a collective effort and that the individual is incapable of doing so independently. Which therefore assets that the perception of the creation of independent meaning is an illusion created by manipulation of social perceptions and expressions.<ref name=\"Marecek, Crawford & Popp\" />\n\nAlsop, Fitzsimmons & Lennon also note that the constructionist accounts of gender creation can be divided into two main streams:<ref name=\"Alsop_Theorizing\">{{cite book | last1 = Alsop | first1 = Rachel | last2 = Fitzsimons | first2 = Annette | last3 = Lennon | first3 = Kathleen | chapter = The social construction of gender | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zwxuGrcA_RgC | title = Theorizing gender | pages = 64&ndash;93 | publisher = Blackwell | location = Malden, Massachusetts | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780745619446 }}</ref>\n# ''Materialist theories'', which underline the structural aspects of the social environment that are responsible for perpetuating certain gender roles;\n# ''Discursive theories'', which stress the creation, through language and culture, of meanings that are associated with gender.\n\nThey also argue that both the materialist and discursive theories of social construction of gender can be either [[Essentialism|essentialist]] or [[Non-essentialism|non-essentialist]].

The view as achieved is supported by the contemporary constructionist perspective, as proposed by Fenstermaker and West, asserts regarding gender as an activity (\"doing\") of utilizing normative prescriptions and beliefs about sex categories based on situational variables. These \"gender activities\" constitute sets of behavior, such as masculine and feminine, which are associated with their sexual counterpart and thus define concepts such as \"man\" and \"woman\" respectively. It is noted, however, that the perception as masculine or feminine is not limited or guaranteed to match the expression's typical or intended nature. Hence, gender can be understood as external to the individual, consisting of a series of ongoing judgements and evaluations by others, as well as of others.<ref name=\"West and Zimmerman\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fenstermaker|first=Sarah|date=2013-05-13|title=Doing Gender, Doing Difference|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9780203615683|doi=10.4324/9780203615683}}</ref>\n[[File:Sushi Rolls not Gender Roles (32945717780).jpg|thumb|alt=|A photo taken during a rally/march that displays a woman holding a sign stating \"Sushi Rolls Not Gender Roles\".]]\n\n====Gender roles====\n[[Gender roles]] are a continuation of the gender status, consisting of other achieved statuses that are associated with a particular gender status.

This is not to imply that participation in gender performativity can not correspond to pressure to fulfill a gender role, nor that fulfillment of a gender role can not satisfy the desire for gender performativity. The distinction refers primarily to context and motivation, rather than particular behaviors and consequences- which are often closely linked.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Butler|first=Judith|date=December 1988|title=Performative Acts and Gender Constitution: An Essay in Phenomenology and Feminist Theory|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3207893?origin=crossref|journal=Theatre Journal|volume=40|issue=4|pages=519|doi=10.2307/3207893}}</ref>\n\nIn some subdomains of feminism, such as [[Intersectionality|intersectional]] feminism, gender is a major though not solitary axis along which factors of oppression are considered, as expressed by Dr Berkowitz, who wrote \"The gender order is hierarchical in that, overall, men dominate women in terms of power and privilege; yet multiple and conflicting sources of power and oppression are intertwined, and not all men dominate all women. Intersectionality theorizes how gender intersects with race, ethnicity, social class, sexuality, and nation in variegated and situationally contingent ways\".<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nDr Berkowitz also asserts that gender at large, especially gender roles, contribute greatly as a prolific and potent avenue by which manipulations of social perceptions and expression manifest reality. Specifically, a reality in which women are typically oppressed by men within a social structure that establishes roles for women, which are of explicitly lesser capacity for accruing and exercising arbitrary power. The system which manifest and exercises this power, is typically referred to as \"patriarchy\". To clarify, the term arbitrary here is used to denote the source of power as being derived from status as feminist theory describes it. The particular model of patriarchy prescribed, does not make any distinction of stratification or power originating from competence or prestige.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Berkowitz, D., Manohar, N., & Tinkler, J.

Primarily, as its actualization is entirely internalized it prevents external parameterization or communication as those are external social behaviors.

The first of which is a psychoanalytic theory stating:<blockquote>Initially, both boys and girls are believed to identify with their mothers. However, at between 3 and 5 years of age this changes, and children identify with the same-sex parent.

Additionally, no description is provided of the methodology by which Bussey and Bandura derived any data from children to reach the conclusions of precisely the feelings being experienced during adolescent development, nor how children of age 5 were able to articulate their feelings at being \"deprived of a penis\". Additionally, no analysis or method is provided explaining how any of this information could be collected in testing the theory nor how the data could be assembled such as to provide a clinical model of childhood development.<ref name=\":7\" /> \n\nThey continue, providing cognitive-developmental analysis of their findings proposing that \"Gender identity is postulated as the basic organizer and regulator of children's gender learning\" and that \"children develop the stereo-typic conceptions of gender from what they see and hear around them\". Their works asserts that after children develop this concept, they also develop \"gender constancy\u2014the belief that their own gender is fixed and irreversible\". Children then act in a way that fulfills their conception, as cognitive consistency is gratifying. This model does not account for the fluidity of gender asserted by persons like American Psychologist [[Lisa M. Diamond]] who explains is not a stable, fixed trait \u2013 rather, it is socially constructed and may vary over time for an individual.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Diamond|first=Lisa M.|last2=Butterworth|first2=Molly|date=2008-09|title=Questioning Gender and Sexual Identity: Dynamic Links Over Time|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11199-008-9425-3|journal=Sex Roles|language=en|volume=59|issue=5-6|pages=365\u2013376|doi=10.1007/s11199-008-9425-3|issn=0360-0025}}</ref> This model directly contravenes both the notion of gender identity being individual and internal, by explaining its source as social behavior and its manifestation as a a desire for congruence with a received notion of gender. It is unclear whether this contradiction occurs as an inconsistency in terminology or as a contradiction of two claims.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nOther proposed models include that of the Gender Schema Theory, which conjectures that the development of gender identity, is a process of self identification which must precede the ability for \"children to label themselves and others as males or females\". Bussey and Alburta note its similarity to the cognitive-developmental analysis, but do not clarify how these similarities manifest. They differ, however, in that the Gender Schema theory proposes the development of gender as a tool for developing children to better categorize and define the social behaviors around them, and contributes to the development of a growing and expanding model. Additionally, the cognitive-developmental analysis asserts that in a developing child the concept of gender is immutable once established, however the Gender Schema theory does not require this assumption, instead leaving the possibility that a developing child may refine and curtail their gendered differentiation according to experiences as they develop and thus produce a more nuanced and individual model than may have been initially received during early and uncontextualized adolescent experiences.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nFourth, Bussey and Bandura discuss the biological theory of gender differentiation. The various theories which follow this track as described include that gender differentation is motivated as a social manifestation of ancestrally inherited differences concerning \"mate preferences, reproductive strategies, parental investment in offspring, and the aggressive nature of males.\" In their analysis of these theories, these differences are discussed exclusively in the context of the males strategic advantage in mating multiple partners, as well as the capacity of males for coercive force in obtaining a mate. This context is an unusual one, and no elucidation is provided as to how or why this particular lens of understanding proto-civilization social dynamics of evolving humans was selected. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA of humans back the the [[most recent common ancestor]] implies that the rate of reproductive success among females was significantly higher than males, in a journal published by the [[Journal of Theoretical Biology]] <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Favre|first=Maroussia|last2=Sornette|first2=Didier|date=2012-10|title=Strong gender differences in reproductive success variance, and the times to the most recent common ancestors|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S002251931200313X|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|language=en|volume=310|pages=43\u201354|doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2012.06.026}}</ref>. Additionally, further study relating to Darwins original work on sexual selectivity has indicated humans as a model species for analysis of sexual selection, specifically female sexual selection <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=Adam G.|last2=Ratterman|first2=Nicholas L.|date=2009-06-16|title=Mate choice and sexual selection: What have we learned since Darwin?|url=https://www.pnas.org/content/106/Supplement_1/10001|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=106|issue=Supplement 1|pages=10001\u201310008|doi=10.1073/pnas.0901129106|issn=0027-8424|pmid=19528643}}</ref> as Darwin observed in On the Origins of Species that in most species sexually assertive males competed among themselves for the selection of choosy drab and coy female mates describing the process of both battle and pursuit as follows:<blockquote>The female could in most cases escape, if wooed by a male that did not please or excite her; and when pursued, as so incessantly occurs, by several males, she would often have the opportunity, whilst they were fighting together, of escaping with, or at least temporarily pairing with, some one male.</blockquote>Darwin and others after him however noticed the ornamentation of females to imply a difference in the human species, but this theory was largely ignored until recent contemporaries continue the work. This theory is further reinforced by the rapid evolutionary departure from chimpanzees, among whom females are not sexually selective and with lesser childhood burdens. It is for these reasons that a model of battle, rape, and a lack of male investment in offspring is inconsistent with prevailing scientific literature despite being a published work reflecting on the gender distinctions which derive as a result of ancestral sexual dynamics on an evolutionary timescale.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Darwin, Charles, 1809-1882.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/71284223|title=On the origins of species : by means of natural selection or the presevation of favoured races in the struggle for life|date=2006|publisher=Folio Society|oclc=71284223}}</ref>\n\nIn general, the work of Bandura and Bussey, despite its prolific citation and endeavour to detail the mechanisms of gender identity as a fact of childhood development, is internally inconsistent, and contradictory to other relevant works on the topic and riddled with indications of bias or ulterior motives. See the presentation of Gender Schema as the only theory which presents gender differentiation as being of utility to the development of a child, while also claimed as similar to the model which presents gender differentiation as an immutable and parasitic side effect of social imposition.\n\nThe study features intense, concentration on the sexual eroticism of children, and the existence of intense neurotic emotion in response to fantasy concerning absence or mutilation of same and opposite sex genitalia, but this is presented absent information as to how this information was extricated from subjects analyzed, or measure to prevent psychological projection onto malleable adolescent subjects in an environment where the subject matter is explicitly predicated on volatile neurotic emotional response to sexual social pressure from adult figures. Additionally, it lacks analysis of controls for selection bias or parental factors and is yet the first theory presented and analyzed by a child gender developmental study.\n\nThe work concerning evolutionary biological theories adopts a very specific lens, which describes the ancestral social paradigm as one predicated upon, rape, coercive violence, and abandonment of females by their male counterparts which not only is absent all socio-cultural analysis and later diverted to focus on hormonal patterns and other physiological phenomena; but is also a model which directly contravenes the prevailing literature on sexual selectivity, evolution, and proto-civiliaztional social dynamics in humans. Additionally, it stands in contradiction to itself and other works which cite it, by the repeated conflation of biological sex, male and female, with gender, gender identity, and their confluence at the concepts of man and woman. A distinction which is fundamental to feminist theory of gender as an achieved status and sex as an ascribed status \n\nThe broadly encompassing comprehensive work of Babdura and Bussey in their summary analysis reflect a complete internal inconsistency of the body of work it represents- which includes dozens of other oft cited studies referenced within itself- as well as total incongruence with prevailing scientific theory on adjacent subjects of biology in a form that is prolific and continuously cited decades after publication.<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\n====Sexuality/sexual orientation====\nIn recent years, elementary schools in the U.S. have started carrying chapter books that include either non-traditional families with same-sex parents, homosexual role models, or (in fewer cases) an adolescent who is discovering and accepting their own sexuality/sexual orientation. Hermann-Wilmarth and Ryan acknowledge this rise in representation, while critiquing the way that the limited selection of books present these characters with an eye towards popularized characterizations of homosexuality.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Hermann-Wilmarth and Ryan|first=Jill M. and Caitlin L.|date=December 2016|title=Queering Chapter Books with LGBT Characters for Young Readers: Recognizing and Complicating Representations of Homonormativity|url=|journal=Discourse: Studies in the Cultural Politics of Education|volume=37|issue=6|pages=846\u2013866|via=EBSCO Academic Search Complete|doi=10.1080/01596306.2014.940234}}</ref> The authors characterize this style of representation as \"homonormative\", and in the only example of a book where the protagonist questions their gender identity, it is left ambiguous as to whether or not they are a trans man or that they were simply pretending.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nDiamond and Butterworth argue that gender identity and sexual identity are fluid and do not always fall into two essentialist categories (man or woman and gay or straight); they came to this conclusion via interviewing women that fall into a sexual minority group over the course of ten years.<ref name=\"Diamond\"/> One woman had a relatively normal early childhood but around adolescence questioned her sexuality and remained stable in her gender and sexual identity until she started working with men and assumed a masculine \"stance\" and started to question her gender identity.<ref name=\"Diamond\"/> When 'she' became a 'he' he began to find men attractive and gradually identified as a homosexual man.<ref name=\"F&W_Institutional\">{{cite book | last1 = Fenstermaker | first1 = Sarah | last2 = West | first2 = Candace | chapter = Reply - (re)doing difference | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LglKdHnVebUC&pg=PA95 | editor1-last = Fenstermaker | editor1-first = Sarah | editor2-last = West | editor2-first = Candace | title = Doing gender, doing difference: inequality, power, and institutional change | pages = 95&ndash;104 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780415931793 }}</ref>\n\nThe perception of sexuality by others is an extension of others' perceptions of one's gender.

LaFrance, Paluck and Brescoll note that as a term, \"gender identity\" allows individuals to express their attitude towards and stance in relation to their current status as either women or men. Turning the scope of gender from a social consensus to objectivity to one's self-identification with a certain gender expression leaves much more space for describing variation among individuals.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = LaFrance | first1 = Marianne | last2 = Paluck | first2 = Elizabeth Levy  | last3 = Brescoll | first3 = Victoria | chapter = Sex changes: a current perspective on the psychology of gender | chapterurl = http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2004-16374-014 | editor1-last = Eagly | editor1-first = Alice H. | editor2-last = Beall | editor2-first = Anne E. | editor3-last = Sternberg | editor3-first = Robert J. | title = The psychology of gender | pages = 328&ndash;344 | publisher = Guilford Press | location = New York | year = 2004 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9781593852443 }}</ref>\n\n=====Intersections of gender identity with other identities=====\n\nGender is constructed for an individual based on the gendered interactions that the individual has with others, as well as, the other identities or roles they may hold. Gender, race, class, and other oppressions are all potential omnirelevant categories, though they are not all identically salient in every kind of social relationship where inequality is present.{{Clarify|date=August 2014}} Multiple oppressions are not seen as having \"additive\" or \"multiplicative\" effects but are seen as simultaneously depending on each other to create a unique form of oppression. Although West and Fenstermaker do not elaborate on exactly how intersectionality can be incorporated into social constructionist theory, they do say that intersecting social identities are constant \"interactional accomplishments\".{{rp|96}}\n\nWhile men and women are held accountable for normative conceptions of gender, this accountability can differ in content based on ethnicity, race, age, class, etc. Hurtado argues that white women and women of color experience gender differently because of their relationship to males of different races and that both groups of women have traditionally been used to substantiate male power in different ways.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Hurtado | first = A\u00edda | title = Relating to privilege: seduction and rejection in the subordination of white women and women of color | journal = Signs: Women in Culture and Society| volume = 14 | issue = 4 | pages = 833&ndash;855 | doi =  10.1086/494546| jstor = 3174686  | date = Summer 1989 | ref = harv }} [https://www.academia.edu/18709632/Relating_to_privilege_Seduction_and_rejection_in_the_subordination_of_white_women_and_women_of_color|doi=10.1086/494546 Pdf.]</ref> Some women of color are subordinated through rejection, or denial of the \"patriarchal invitation to privilege\".<ref name=\"F&W_Accomplish\">{{cite book | last1 = Fenstermaker | first1 = Sarah | last2 = West | first2 = Candace | chapter = Power, inequality, and the accomplishment of gender: an ethnomethodological view | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LglKdHnVebUC&pg=PR5 | editor1-last = Fenstermaker | editor1-first = Sarah | editor2-last = West | editor2-first = Candace | title = Doing gender, doing difference: inequality, power, and institutional change | page = 52 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780415931793 }}</ref> For instance, some white men may see women of color as workers and objects of sexual aggression; this would allow the men to display power and sexual aggression without the emotional attachment that they have to white women.

West and Fenstermaker conclude that doing gender involves different versions of accountability, depending on women's \"relational position\" to white men.<ref name=\"F&W_Accomplish\" />\n\n====Gender as accomplishment====\n\nGender, according to West and Zimmerman, is not simply what one is, but what one does \u2013 it is actively produced within social interactions. Gender is an accomplishment : \"the activity of managing situated conduct in light of normative conceptions of attitudes and activities appropriate for one's sex category\".<ref name=\"West and Zimmerman\" />{{rp|127}} People do not have to be in mixed gender groups or in groups at all for the performance of gender to occur; the production of gender occurs with others and is even performed alone, in the imagined presence of others. [[Doing gender|\"Doing\" gender]] is not just about conforming to stereotypical gender roles \u2013 it is the active engagement in any behavior that is gendered, or behavior that may be evaluated as gendered.\n\nThe performance of gender varies given the context: time, space, social interaction, etc. The enactment of gender roles is context dependent \u2013 roles  are \"situated identities\" instead of \"master identities\".<ref name=\"West and Zimmerman\" />{{rp|131}} The sociology of knowledge must first of all concern itself with what people \"know\" as \"reality\" in their everyday, non- or pre-theoretical lives.

In other words, by doing gender, we reinforce the essential categories of gender \u2013 that there are only two categories that are mutually exclusive. The idea that men and women are essentially different is what makes men and women behave in ways that appear essentially different. Though sex categorization is based on biological sex, it is maintained as a category through socially constructed displays of gender (for example, you could identify a transgender person as female when in fact she is assigned male at birth).\n\nInstitutions also create normative conceptions of gender. In other words, gender is simultaneously created and maintained \u2013 \"both a process and a product, medium and outcome of such power relations\".<ref name=\"Mumby\">{{cite journal | last = Mumby | first = Dennis K. | title = Organizing men: power, discourse, and the social construction of masculinity(s) in the workplace | journal = [[Communication Theory (journal)|Communication Theory]] | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 164&ndash;183, 169 | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2885.1998.tb00216.x | date = May 1998 | ref = harv }}</ref> In his examination of blue and white-collar workers, Mumby<ref name=\"Mumby\"/> argued that hegemonic or dominant masculinity provides a standard of acceptable behavior for men, and at the same time, is the product of men's behavior.

They are aware that others may evaluate and characterize their behavior. This is an interactional process (not just an individual one). Social constructionism asserts that gender is a category that people evaluate as omnirelevant to social life.<ref>{{cite book | last = Garfinkel | first = Harold | title = Studies in ethnomethodology | publisher = Prentice-Hall | location = Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey | origyear = 1967 | year = 2016 | isbn = 9780745600055 }}</ref> Gender as omnirelevant means that people can always be judged by what they do as a man or as a woman. This is the basis for the reasoning that people are always performing gender and that gender is always relevant in social situations.\n\nAccountability can apply to behaviors that do conform to cultural conceptions as well as those behaviors that deviate \u2013 it is the ''possibility'' of being held accountable that is important in social constructionism. For example, Stobbe examined the rationale that people gave for why there were small numbers of women in the auto industry. Men cited the idea that such dirty work was unsuitable for women and women were unable to train because of family duties. Stobbe argues that the male workers created a [[machismo]] masculinity to distinguish themselves from women who might have been qualified to work in the auto shop. Women who do work in male-dominated professions have to carefully maintain and simultaneously balance their femininity and professional credibility.<ref>{{cite journal |ref=harv |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0432.2005.00265.x |title=Doing Machismo: Legitimating Speech Acts as a Selection Discourse |journal=Gender, Work and Organization |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=105\u2013123 |year=2005 |last1=Stobbe |first1=Lineke |url=http://dare.ubvu.vu.nl/bitstream/1871/33804/1/178738.pdf }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |ref=harv |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0432.2005.00263.x |title=The Third Sex: Women Leaders in Australian Agriculture |journal=Gender, Work and Organization |volume=12 |pages=73\u201388 |year=2005 |last1=Pini |first1=Barbara }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |ref=harv |doi=10.1177/0959353505051728 |title=Making Sense of Gender, Age, Power and Disciplinary Position: Intersecting Discourses in the Academy |journal=Feminism & Psychology |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=189\u2013208 |year=2016 |last1=S\u00f8ndergaard |first1=Dorte Marie }}</ref>\n\nEven though gender seems more salient in some situations \u2013 for instance, when a woman enters a male-dominated profession \u2013 gender categories also become salient in contexts in which gender is less obvious.

People have preconceived notions about what particular racial groups look like (although there is no biological component to this categorization). Accountability is interactional because it does not occur solely within the individual. It is also institutional because individuals may be held accountable for their behaviors by institutions or by others in social situations, as a member of any social group (gender, race, class, etc.).<ref name=\"F&W_Institutional\" />{{rp|96}} This notion of accountability makes gender dynamic because what is considered appropriate behavior for men and women changes and is reproduced over time and is reproduced differently depending on context.

This outdated perception, according to Butler, is limiting in that it adheres to the dominant societal constraints that label gender as binary. In scrutinizing gender, Butler introduces a nuanced perception in which she unites the concepts of [[performativity]] and gender. In chapter one of the text, Butler introduces the unification of the terms gender and performativity in stating that \"gender proves to be performance\u2014that is, constituting the identity it is purported to be. In this sense, gender is always a doing, though not a doing by a subject who might be said to pre-exist the deed\".<ref>{{cite book | last = Butler | first = Judith | authorlink = Judith Butler | title = Gender trouble: feminism and the subversion of identity | page = [https://archive.org/details/gendertroublefem00butl/page/25 25] | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | origyear = 1990 | year = 1999 | isbn = 9780415924993 | url = https://archive.org/details/gendertroublefem00butl/page/25 }}</ref> In demystifying this concept, Butler sets out to clarify that there is indeed a difference in the terms gender performance and gender performativity. In doing so, Butler states in an interview: \"When we say that gender is performed, we usually mean that we've taken on a role; we're acting in some way\u2026To say that gender is performative is a little different\u2026For something to be performative means that it produces a series of effects. We act and walk and speak and talk that consolidate an impression of being a man or being a woman\u2026we act as if that being of a man or that being of a woman is actually an internal reality or simply something that is true about us. Actually, it is a phenomenon that is being produced all the time and reproduced all the time.\"<ref>{{cite AV media | people= [[Judith Butler]] | date= 6 June 2011 |accessdate= 22 June 2016 | title= Judith Butler: Your Behavior Creates Your Gender | medium= Video | publisher= [[Big Think]] via [[YouTube]] | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo7o2LYATDc}}</ref> Thus, Butler perceives gender as being constructed through a set of acts that are said to be in compliance with dominant societal norms. Butler is, however, not stating that gender is a sort of performance in which an individual can terminate the act; instead, what Butler is stating is that this performance is ongoing and out of an individual's control. In fact, rather than an individual producing the performance, the opposite is true. The performance is what produces the individual. Specifically, Butler approvingly quotes Nietzsche's claim that \"there is no 'being' behind doing\u2026 'the doer' is merely a fiction added to the deed \u2013 the deed is everything.\"<ref>{{cite book | last = Butler | first = Judith | author-link = Judith Butler | title = Gender trouble: feminism and the subversion of identity | page = 25 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780415389556 }}</ref> Thus, the emphasis is placed not on the individual producing the deed but on the deed itself. Although a seemingly difficult concept to grasp, gender performativity is realized throughout many aspects of our lives, specifically in our infancy and young childhood, our teen years, and finally our adult lives.\n\nOn Butler's hypothesis, the socially constructed aspect of gender performativity is perhaps most obvious in [[Drag (clothing)#Drag kings and queens|drag]] performance, which offers a rudimentary understanding of [[gender binary|gender binaries]] in its emphasis on gender performance. Butler understands drag cannot be regarded as an example of subjective or singular identity, where \"there is a 'one' who is prior to gender, a one who goes to the wardrobe of gender decides with deliberation which gender it will be today\".<ref name=\"GLQ_Butler\">{{Cite journal | last = Butler | first = Judith | author-link = Judith Butler | title = Critically queer | journal = [[GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies]] | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 17&ndash;32 | doi = 10.1215/10642684-1-1-17 | date = November 1993 | ref = harv }}</ref>{{rp|21}} Consequently, drag should not be considered the honest expression of its performer's intent. Rather, Butler suggests that what is performed \"can only be understood through reference to what is barred from the signifier within the domain of corporeal legibility\".<ref name=\"GLQ_Butler\" />{{rp|24}}\n\n[[Amelia Jones]] proposes that this mode of viewing gender offered a way to move beyond the theories of the [[gaze]] and [[sexual fetishism]], which had attained much prominence in academic feminism, but which by the 1980s Jones viewed as outdated methods of understanding women's societal status. Jones believes the performative power to act out gender is extremely useful as a framework, offering new ways to consider images as enactments with embodied subjects rather than inanimate objects for men's viewing pleasure.<ref>{{cite book | editor-last = Jones | editor-first = Amelia | editor-link = Amelia Jones | title = The feminism and visual culture reader | page = [https://archive.org/details/feminismvisualcu0000unse/page/370 370] | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780415267069 | url = https://archive.org/details/feminismvisualcu0000unse/page/370 }}</ref>\n\n===Infancy and young childhood===\n\nThe idea around gender performativity, when applied to infancy and young childhood, deals with the idea that from the moment one is conceived, arguably even before that, who they are and who they will become is predetermined. Children learn at a very young age what it means to be a boy or girl in our society. Individuals are either given masculine or feminine names based on their sex, are assigned colors that are deemed appropriate only when utilized by a particular sex and are even given toys that will aid them in recognizing their proper places in society. According to Barbara Kerr and Karen Multon, many parents would be puzzled to know \"the tendency of little children to think that it is their clothing or toys that make them boy or girl\".<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Kerr | first1 = Barbara A. | last2 = Multon | first2 = Karen D. | title = The development of gender identity, gender roles, and gender relations in gifted students | journal = [[Journal of Counseling & Development]] | volume = 93 | issue = 2 | page = 183 | doi = 10.1002/j.1556-6676.2015.00194.x | date = April 2015 | ref = harv }}</ref> Parents are going as far as coordinating their daughter with the color pink because it's feminine, or blue for their son because it's masculine.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Witt |first1=Susan D. |title=Parental Influence on Children's Socialization to Gender Roles |url=http://gozips.uakron.edu/~susan8/parinf.htm |accessdate=16 July 2018 |date=1997}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">http://gozips.uakron.edu/~susan8/parinf.htm</ref> In discussing these points, Penelope Eckert, in her text titled ''Language and Gender'', states: \"the first thing people want to know about a baby is its sex, and social convention provides a myriad of props to reduce the necessity of asking\".<ref name=\"Language and Gender\">{{cite book | last1 = Eckert | first1 = Penelope | last2 = McConnell-Ginet | first2 = Sally | title = Language and gender | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge New York | year = 2013 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9781107659360 }}</ref> Thus, this reinforces the importance and emphasis that society places not only on sex but also on ways in which to point towards one's sex without implicitly doing so. Eckert furthers this in stating that determining sex at one's birth is also vital of how one presents themselves in society at an older age because \"sex determination sets the stage for a lifelong process of gendering\".<ref name=\"Language and Gender\"/> Eckert's statement points to Judith Butler's view of gender as being performative. Similar to Butler, Eckert is hinting to the fact that gender is not an internal reality that cannot be changed. What Eckert is instead stating is that this is a common misconception that a majority of the population unknowingly reinforces, which sees its emergence during infancy.\n\nButler suggests in both \"Critically Queer\" and \"Melancholy Gender\",<ref>{{cite book | last = Butler | first = Judith | authorlink = Judith Butler | title = The psychic life of power: theories in subjection | publisher = Stanford University Press | location = Stanford, California | year = 1997 | isbn = 9780804728126 }}</ref> that the child/subject's ability to grieve the loss of the same-sex parent as a viable love object is barred. Following from [[Sigmund Freud]]'s notion of [[melancholia]], such a repudiation results in a heightened identification with the Other that cannot be loved, resulting in gender performances which create allegories of, and internalize the lost love that the subject is subsequently unable to acknowledge or grieve. Butler explains that \"a masculine gender is formed from the refusal to grieve the masculine as a possibility of love; a feminine gender is formed (taken on, assumed) through the fantasy which the feminine is excluded as a possible object of love, an exclusion never grieved, but 'preserved' through the heightening of feminine identification itself\".<ref name=\"GLQ_Butler\" />{{rp|25}}\n\n===Teen years===\n\nOne's teen years are the prime time in which socialization occurs as well as the time in which how one presents themselves in society is of high concern. Often, this is the time in which one's ability to master their gender performance labels them as successful, and thus normal, or unsuccessful, and thus strange and unfitting. One of the sources that demonstrate how successful performance is acted out is magazines, specifically magazines targeting young girls. According to Eckert, \"When we are teenagers, the teen magazines told girls how to make conversation with boys\u2026\".<ref name=\"Language and Gender\" />{{rp|275}} This not only emphasizes the fact that gender is something that is taught to us and is continuously being shaped by society's expectations, but it also points to one of the ways in which individuals are being subconsciously trained to be ideal participants in the gender binary. Thus calling back to Butler's perception that gender is not a fact about us but is something that is taught to us and is being constantly reinforced. This idea that gender is constantly shaped by expectations is relevant in the online community. Teenagers are easily able to formulate relationships and friendships online, thus increasing the probability of a teenager's delicate identity to be manipulated and distorted.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Valkenburg|first=Patti M.|last2=Peter|first2=Jochen|date=February 2011|title=Online Communication Among Adolescents: An Integrated Model of Its Attraction, Opportunities, and Risks|journal=Journal of Adolescent Health|volume=48|issue=2|pages=121\u2013127|doi=10.1016/j.jadohealth.2010.08.020|pmid=21257109|issn=1054-139X}}</ref> Teenagers often come across situations in real life and online that cause them to question themselves when facing society, including gender performance.\n\n<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=B.

This model diverges from the hegemonic analytical framework of gender that many claim is [[Heteronormativity|heteronormative]], contending with the ways in which queer actors problematize the traditional construction of gender. Butler adapts the psychoanalytical term of melancholia to conceptualize homoerotic subtext as it exists in western literature and especially the relationship between women writers, their gender, and their sexuality. Melancholia deals with mourning, but for homosexual couples it is not just mourning the death of the relationship, instead it is the societal disavowal of the relationship itself and the ability to mourn, thus leading to repression of these feelings.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McIvor|first=David W.|date=2012|title=Bringing Ourselves to Grief: Judith Butler and the Politics of Mourning|journal=Political Theory|volume=40|issue=4|pages=409\u2013436|jstor=41703076|doi=10.1177/0090591712444841}}</ref> This idea is reflected in the activism of organized by political groups such as [[ACT UP]] during the AIDS crisis. Many of the survivors that participated in this activism were homosexuals whom has lost their partners to the disease. The survivors commemorated the dead by quilting together their rags, repurposing their possessions, and displaying their own bodies for premature mourning. All of these protests amounted to a message that some part of them will be left in the world after they have expired.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Epstein|first=Julia|date=Fall 1992|title=AIDS, Stigma, and Narratives of Containment|journal=American Imago|volume=49|issue=3|pages=293\u2013310|jstor=26304009}}</ref>\n\nQueer Failure is a concept in queer theory that also calls gender into question, because it examines queer art and the bodies of LGBTQ+ people through the lens of what a parental figure may identify as \"failure\" on the part of their character.

This serves as a form of gender boundary policing. People who identify as women are expected to conform to stereotypical gendered appearances, as are people who identify as male. Students regularly take part in policing gender boundaries through bullying. Male students frequently harass male and female students, while female students generally only harass other female students. The practice of male students bullying other male students is explicitly linked to [[machismo]], which is the notion that boys are expected to subscribe to in order to be constructed and related to as 'normal' boys.<ref name=\"Martino\">{{cite book | last1 = Martino | first1 = Wayne | last2 = Pallota-Chiarollo | first2 = Maria | title = Being normal is the only way to be: adolescent perspectives on gender and school | publisher = UNSW Press | location = Sydney, NSW | year = 2005 | isbn = 9780868407708 }}</ref> Many girls report that boys tease and ridicule them on the basis of their appearance, which is linked to boys asserting masculine power through sexist practices of denigrating girls.<ref name=\"Martino\" /> This also serves to perpetuate the idea that appearance is a female's most important asset.

Overall, gender-based harassment serves to define and enforce gender boundaries of students by students.\n\n===Adolescent view of adulthood===\n\nGender is a [[cultural]] construction which creates an environment where an adolescent's performance in high school is related to their life goals and expectations. Because some young women believe that they want to be mothers and wives, the choice of professions and future goals can be inherently flawed by the gender constraints.  Because a girl may want to be a mother later, her academics in high school can create clear [[gender difference]]s because \"higher occupational expectations, educational expectations, and academic grades were more strongly associated with the expected age of parenthood for girls than for boys\".<ref name=\"Crockett, Lisa J. 2012\">{{cite journal | last1 = Crockett | first1 = Lisa J. | last2 = Beal | first2 = Sarah J. | title = The life course in the making: gender and the development of adolescents' expected timing of adult role transitions | journal = [[Developmental Psychology (journal)|Developmental Psychology]] | volume = 48 | issue = 6 | pages = 1727&ndash;1738 | doi = 10.1037/a0027538 | pmid = 22448985 | date = November 2012 | ref = harv }}</ref> With \"young women recognizing potential conflicts between the demands of work and family\", they will not try as hard in high school allowing males to achieve higher academic achievement then girls.

Women especially are constrained in the way they view their adulthood even at a young age because of [[motherhood]].\n\nMales can also be subject to gender construction due to social expectations of masculinity. According to [[Jack Halberstam]] (under the name Judith), people correlate masculinity with \"maleness and to power to domination\u201d, something that he believes is a result of patriarchy.<ref>{{cite book | last = Halberstam | first = Judith | title = Female masculinity | publisher = Duke University Press | location = Durham | year = 1998 | language = en | url = https://archive.org/details/femalemasculinit00judi | isbn = 9780822322436 | url-access = registration }}</ref> In a 2015 study published in the ''[[American Journal of Public Health]]'', researchers stated that gender construct can differ depending on the man's race or ethnicity and stated that for white men there was an emphasis on \"education,employment, and socioeconomic status\" whereas the expectations for black men focused on \"sexual prowess, physical dominance, and gamesmanship\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Fields |first=Errol Lamont |last2=Bogart |first2=Laura M. |last3=Smith |first3=Katherine C. |last4=Malebranche |first4=David J. |last5=Ellen |first5=Jonathan |last6=Schuster |first6=Mark A. | title = \"I always felt I had to prove my manhood\": homosexuality, masculinity, gender role strain, and HIV risk among young Black men who have sex with men | journal = [[American Journal of Public Health]] | volume = 105 | issue = 1 | pages = 122&ndash;131 | doi = 10.2105/ajph.2013.301866 | pmid = 24832150 | date = January 2015 | ref = harv | pmc=4265897}}</ref> These expectations can make it harder for males to display emotions without receiving criticism and being seen as less of a man.\n\nAdolescents view on [[adulthood]] is also determined by their employment in high school.

Mortimer explains \"youth who work during high school, and those who devote more hours to work, are more [[vocation]]ally successful after leaving high school\".<ref name=\"Mortimer 2005\" /> This creates a distinct gender difference in which men are more likely to be employed after high school than women if they have worked during high school.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Marsh | first = Herbert W. | title = Employment during high school: character building or a subversion of academic goals? | journal = [[Sociology of Education (journal)|Sociology of Education]] | volume = 64 | issue = 3 | pages = 172&ndash;189 | doi = 10.2307/2112850 | jstor = 2112850 | date = July 1991 | ref = harv }}</ref> This means women may be at an academic advantage if they do not work in high school and focus on school work.\n\n===Depression===\n\nHigh school continues to become a more high-pressure environment with academic and social triggers increasing the expectations of adolescents.

Specifically it asserts that reality exists as the summation of social perceptions and expression; and that the reality which is perceived is the only reality worth consideration. This is accompanied by the corollaries that any perceived reality is valid, that reality is subject to manipulation via control over social perceptions and expressions.\n\nThe social constructionist movement emerged in relation to both criticism and rejection of [[Objectivism]] developed by Russian-American writer [[Ayn Rand]]. Specifically, in the assumption of a positivist basis for knowledge; which is to say that social constructionism rejects the notion that empirical facts can be known about reality, where as objectivism is defined by it. Though not explicitly reliant on it, much literature on the subject of social constructionism focuses on its relationship in many facets to hierarchy and power.

The view as achieved is supported by the contemporary constructionist perspective, as proposed by Fenstermaker and West, asserts regarding gender as an activity (\"doing\") of utilizing normative prescriptions and beliefs about sex categories based on situational variables. These \"gender activities\" constitute sets of behavior, such as masculine and feminine, which are associated with their sexual counterpart and thus define concepts such as \"man\" and \"woman\" respectively. It is noted, however, that the perception as masculine or feminine is not limited or guaranteed to match the expression's typical or intended nature. Hence, gender can be understood as external to the individual, consisting of a series of ongoing judgements and evaluations by others, as well as of others.\n[[File:Sushi Rolls not Gender Roles (32945717780).jpg|thumb|alt=|A photo taken during a rally/march that displays a woman holding a sign stating \"Sushi Rolls Not Gender Roles\".]]\n\n====Gender roles====\n[[Gender roles]] are a continuation of the gender status, consisting of other achieved statuses that are associated with a particular gender status.

This is not to imply that participation in gender performativity can not correspond to pressure to fulfill a gender role, nor that fulfillment of a gender role can not satisfy the desire for gender performativity. The distinction refers primarily to context and motivation, rather than particular behaviors and consequences- which are often closely linked.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Butler|first=Judith|date=December 1988|title=Performative Acts and Gender Constitution: An Essay in Phenomenology and Feminist Theory|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3207893?origin=crossref|journal=Theatre Journal|volume=40|issue=4|pages=519|doi=10.2307/3207893}}</ref>\n\nIn some subdomains of feminism, such as [[Intersectionality|intersectional]] feminism, gender is a major though not solitary axis along which factors of oppression are considered, as expressed by Dr Berkowitz, who wrote \"The gender order is hierarchical in that, overall, men dominate women in terms of power and privilege; yet multiple and conflicting sources of power and oppression are intertwined, and not all men dominate all women. Intersectionality theorizes how gender intersects with race, ethnicity, social class, sexuality, and nation in variegated and situationally contingent ways\".<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nDr Berkowitz also asserts that gender at large, especially gender roles, contribute greatly as a prolific and potent avenue by which manipulations of social perceptions and expression manifest reality. Specifically, a reality in which women are typically oppressed by men within a social structure that establishes roles for women, which are of explicitly lesser capacity for accruing and exercising arbitrary power. The system which manifest and exercises this power, is typically referred to as \"patriarchy\". To clarify, the term arbitrary here is used to denote the source of power as being derived from status as feminist theory describes it. The particular model of patriarchy prescribed, does not make any distinction of stratification or power originating from competence or prestige.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Berkowitz, D., Manohar, N., & Tinkler, J.

The term inherently lacks qualification of what does or does not constitute gender identity. Primarily, as its actualization is entirely internalized it prevents external parameterization or communication as those are external social behaviors. In a work titled Social Cognitive Theory of Gender Development and Differentiation by Doctors of Psychology, Kay Bussey and Alburta Bandura published in [[Psychological Review]] and [[Citation|academically cited]] approximately 2817 times<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1999-11924-002|title=APA PsycNet|website=psycnet.apa.org|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> (and thousands more in the citations to secondary literature on which the analysis is based), the pair review a variety of explanations for the modes and mechanism contributing to the cultivation of childhood gender identity. The first of which is a psychoanalytic theory stating:<blockquote>Initially, both boys and girls are believed to identify with their mothers. However, at between 3 and 5 years of age this changes, and children identify with the same-sex parent. Identification with the same-sex parent is pre-sumed to resolve the conflict children experience as a result of erotic attachment to the opposite-sex parent and jealousy toward the same-sex parent. This attachment causes children much anxiety as they fear retaliation from the same-sex parent.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Bussey|first=Kay|last2=Bandura|first2=Albert|date=1999|title=Social cognitive theory of gender development and differentiation.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0033-295X.106.4.676|journal=Psychological Review|language=en|volume=106|issue=4|pages=676\u2013713|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.106.4.676|issn=1939-1471}}</ref></blockquote>The principle contention being that gender differentiation in children is motivated by sexual attraction to the parent, as well as negative emotion, fear, and anxiety regarding threats or retaliation from the same-sex parent. In this, they also describe this as resulting in \"boys' castration anxieties.\" and \"[girls facing] resentment over being de-prived of a penis, inferior, and fear retaliation from the mother for their designs on their father.\" Bussey and Bandura do not provide in their research any study of the frequency of these fears or anxieties, nor any multi-varied analysis of peripheral factors to these feelings erotic or neurotic. Additionally, no description is provided of the methodology by which Bussey and Bandura derived any data from children to reach the conclusions of precisely the feelings being experienced during adolescent development, nor how children of age 5 were able to articulate their feelings at being \"deprived of a penis\". Additionally, no analysis or method is provided explaining how any of this information could be collected in testing the theory nor how the data could be assembled such as to provide a clinical model of childhood development.<ref name=\":7\" /> \n\nThey continue, providing cognitive-developmental analysis of their findings proposing that \"Gender identity is postulated as the basic organizer and regulator of children's gender learning\" and that \"children develop the stereo-typic conceptions of gender from what they see and hear around them\". Their works asserts that after children develop this concept, they also develop \"gender constancy\u2014the belief that their own gender is fixed and irreversible\". Children then act in a way that fulfills their conception, as cognitive consistency is gratifying. This model does not account for the fluidity of gender asserted by persons like American Psychologist [[Lisa M. Diamond]] who explains is not a stable, fixed trait \u2013 rather, it is socially constructed and may vary over time for an individual.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Diamond|first=Lisa M.|last2=Butterworth|first2=Molly|date=2008-09|title=Questioning Gender and Sexual Identity: Dynamic Links Over Time|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11199-008-9425-3|journal=Sex Roles|language=en|volume=59|issue=5-6|pages=365\u2013376|doi=10.1007/s11199-008-9425-3|issn=0360-0025}}</ref> This model directly contravenes both the notion of gender identity being individual and internal, by explaining its source as social behavior and its manifestation as a a desire for congruence with a received notion of gender. It is unclear whether this contradiction occurs as an inconsistency in terminology or as a contradiction of two claims.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nOther proposed models include that of the Gender Schema Theory, which conjectures that the development of gender identity, is a process of self identification which must precede the ability for \"children to label themselves and others as males or females\". Bussey and Alburta note its similarity to the cognitive-developmental analysis, but do not clarify how these similarities manifest. They differ, however, in that the Gender Schema theory proposes the development of gender as a tool for developing children to better categorize and define the social behaviors around them, and contributes to the development of a growing and expanding model. Additionally, the cognitive-developmental analysis asserts that in a developing child the concept of gender is immutable once established, however the Gender Schema theory does not require this assumption, instead leaving the possibility that a developing child may refine and curtail their gendered differentiation according to experiences as they develop and thus produce a more nuanced and individual model than may have been initially received during early and uncontextualized adolescent experiences.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nFourth, Bussey and Bandura discuss the biological theory of gender differentiation. The various theories which follow this track as described include that gender differentation is motivated as a social manifestation of ancestrally inherited differences concerning \"mate preferences, reproductive strategies, parental investment in offspring, and the aggressive nature of males.\" In their analysis of these theories, these differences are discussed exclusively in the context of the males strategic advantage in mating multiple partners, as well as the capacity of males for coercive force in obtaining a mate. This context is an unusual one, and no elucidation is provided as to how or why this particular lens of understanding proto-civilization social dynamics of evolving humans was selected. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA of humans back the the [[most recent common ancestor]] implies that the rate of reproductive success among females was significantly higher than males, in a journal published by the [[Journal of Theoretical Biology]] <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Favre|first=Maroussia|last2=Sornette|first2=Didier|date=2012-10|title=Strong gender differences in reproductive success variance, and the times to the most recent common ancestors|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S002251931200313X|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|language=en|volume=310|pages=43\u201354|doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2012.06.026}}</ref>. Additionally, further study relating to Darwins original work on sexual selectivity has indicated humans as a model species for analysis of sexual selection, specifically female sexual selection <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=Adam G.|last2=Ratterman|first2=Nicholas L.|date=2009-06-16|title=Mate choice and sexual selection: What have we learned since Darwin?|url=https://www.pnas.org/content/106/Supplement_1/10001|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=106|issue=Supplement 1|pages=10001\u201310008|doi=10.1073/pnas.0901129106|issn=0027-8424|pmid=19528643}}</ref> as Darwin observed in On the Origins of Species that in most species sexually assertive males competed among themselves for the selection of choosy drab and coy female mates describing the process of both battle and pursuit as follows:<blockquote>The female could in most cases escape, if wooed by a male that did not please or excite her; and when pursued, as so incessantly occurs, by several males, she would often have the opportunity, whilst they were fighting together, of escaping with, or at least temporarily pairing with, some one male.</blockquote>Darwin and others after him however noticed the ornamentation of females to imply a difference in the human species, but this theory was largely ignored until recent contemporaries continue the work. This theory is further reinforced by the rapid evolutionary departure from chimpanzees, among whom females are not sexually selective and with lesser childhood burdens. It is for these reasons that a model of battle, rape, and a lack of male investment in offspring is inconsistent with prevailing scientific literature despite being a published work reflecting on the gender distinctions which derive as a result of ancestral sexual dynamics on an evolutionary timescale.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Darwin, Charles, 1809-1882.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/71284223|title=On the origins of species : by means of natural selection or the presevation of favoured races in the struggle for life|date=2006|publisher=Folio Society|oclc=71284223}}</ref>\n\nIn general, the work of Bandura and Bussey, despite its prolific citation and endeavour to detail the mechanisms of gender identity as a fact of childhood development, is internally inconsistent, and contradictory to other relevant works on the topic and riddled with indications of bias or ulterior motives. See the presentation of Gender Schema as the only theory which presents gender differentiation as being of utility to the development of a child, while also claimed as similar to the model which presents gender differentiation as an immutable and parasitic side effect of social imposition.\n\nThe study features intense, concentration on the sexual eroticism of children, and the existence of intense neurotic emotion in response to fantasy concerning absence or mutilation of same and opposite sex genitalia, but this is presented absent information as to how this information was extricated from subjects analyzed, or measure to prevent psychological projection onto malleable adolescent subjects in an environment where the subject matter is explicitly predicated on volatile neurotic emotional response to sexual social pressure from adult figures. Additionally, it lacks analysis of controls for selection bias or parental factors and is yet the first theory presented and analyzed by a child gender developmental study.\n\nThe work concerning evolutionary biological theories adopts a very specific lens, which describes the ancestral social paradigm as one predicated upon, rape, coercive violence, and abandonment of females by their male counterparts which not only is absent all socio-cultural analysis and later diverted to focus on hormonal patterns and other physiological phenomena; but is also a model which directly contravenes the prevailing literature on sexual selectivity, evolution, and proto-civiliaztional social dynamics in humans. Additionally, it stands in contradiction to itself and other works which cite it, by the repeated conflation of biological sex, male and female, with gender, gender identity, and their confluence at the concepts of man and woman. A distinction which is fundamental to feminist theory of gender as an achieved status and sex as an ascribed status \n\nThe broadly encompassing comprehensive work of Babdura and Bussey in their summary analysis reflect a complete internal inconsistency of the body of work it represents- which includes dozens of other oft cited studies referenced within itself- as well as total incongruence with prevailing scientific theory on adjacent subjects of biology in a form that is prolific and continuously cited decades after publication.<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\n====Sexuality/sexual orientation====\nIn recent years, elementary schools in the U.S. have started carrying chapter books that include either non-traditional families with same-sex parents, homosexual role models, or (in fewer cases) an adolescent who is discovering and accepting their own sexuality/sexual orientation. Hermann-Wilmarth and Ryan acknowledge this rise in representation, while critiquing the way that the limited selection of books present these characters with an eye towards popularized characterizations of homosexuality.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Hermann-Wilmarth and Ryan|first=Jill M. and Caitlin L.|date=December 2016|title=Queering Chapter Books with LGBT Characters for Young Readers: Recognizing and Complicating Representations of Homonormativity|url=|journal=Discourse: Studies in the Cultural Politics of Education|volume=37|issue=6|pages=846\u2013866|via=EBSCO Academic Search Complete|doi=10.1080/01596306.2014.940234}}</ref> The authors characterize this style of representation as \"homonormative\", and in the only example of a book where the protagonist questions their gender identity, it is left ambiguous as to whether or not they are a trans man or that they were simply pretending.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nDiamond and Butterworth argue that gender identity and sexual identity are fluid and do not always fall into two essentialist categories (man or woman and gay or straight); they came to this conclusion via interviewing women that fall into a sexual minority group over the course of ten years.<ref name=\"Diamond\"/> One woman had a relatively normal early childhood but around adolescence questioned her sexuality and remained stable in her gender and sexual identity until she started working with men and assumed a masculine \"stance\" and started to question her gender identity.<ref name=\"Diamond\"/> When 'she' became a 'he' he began to find men attractive and gradually identified as a homosexual man.<ref name=\"F&W_Institutional\">{{cite book | last1 = Fenstermaker | first1 = Sarah | last2 = West | first2 = Candace | chapter = Reply - (re)doing difference | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LglKdHnVebUC&pg=PA95 | editor1-last = Fenstermaker | editor1-first = Sarah | editor2-last = West | editor2-first = Candace | title = Doing gender, doing difference: inequality, power, and institutional change | pages = 95&ndash;104 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780415931793 }}</ref>\n\nThe perception of sexuality by others is an extension of others' perceptions of one's gender.

LaFrance, Paluck and Brescoll note that as a term, \"gender identity\" allows individuals to express their attitude towards and stance in relation to their current status as either women or men. Turning the scope of gender from a social consensus to objectivity to one's self-identification with a certain gender expression leaves much more space for describing variation among individuals.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = LaFrance | first1 = Marianne | last2 = Paluck | first2 = Elizabeth Levy  | last3 = Brescoll | first3 = Victoria | chapter = Sex changes: a current perspective on the psychology of gender | chapterurl = http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2004-16374-014 | editor1-last = Eagly | editor1-first = Alice H. | editor2-last = Beall | editor2-first = Anne E. | editor3-last = Sternberg | editor3-first = Robert J. | title = The psychology of gender | pages = 328&ndash;344 | publisher = Guilford Press | location = New York | year = 2004 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9781593852443 }}</ref>\n\n=====Intersections of gender identity with other identities=====\n\nGender is constructed for an individual based on the gendered interactions that the individual has with others, as well as, the other identities or roles they may hold. Gender, race, class, and other oppressions are all potential omnirelevant categories, though they are not all identically salient in every kind of social relationship where inequality is present.{{Clarify|date=August 2014}} Multiple oppressions are not seen as having \"additive\" or \"multiplicative\" effects but are seen as simultaneously depending on each other to create a unique form of oppression. Although West and Fenstermaker do not elaborate on exactly how intersectionality can be incorporated into social constructionist theory, they do say that intersecting social identities are constant \"interactional accomplishments\".{{rp|96}}\n\nWhile men and women are held accountable for normative conceptions of gender, this accountability can differ in content based on ethnicity, race, age, class, etc. Hurtado argues that white women and women of color experience gender differently because of their relationship to males of different races and that both groups of women have traditionally been used to substantiate male power in different ways.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Hurtado | first = A\u00edda | title = Relating to privilege: seduction and rejection in the subordination of white women and women of color | journal = Signs: Women in Culture and Society| volume = 14 | issue = 4 | pages = 833&ndash;855 | doi =  10.1086/494546| jstor = 3174686  | date = Summer 1989 | ref = harv }} [https://www.academia.edu/18709632/Relating_to_privilege_Seduction_and_rejection_in_the_subordination_of_white_women_and_women_of_color|doi=10.1086/494546 Pdf.]</ref> Some women of color are subordinated through rejection, or denial of the \"patriarchal invitation to privilege\".<ref name=\"F&W_Accomplish\">{{cite book | last1 = Fenstermaker | first1 = Sarah | last2 = West | first2 = Candace | chapter = Power, inequality, and the accomplishment of gender: an ethnomethodological view | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LglKdHnVebUC&pg=PR5 | editor1-last = Fenstermaker | editor1-first = Sarah | editor2-last = West | editor2-first = Candace | title = Doing gender, doing difference: inequality, power, and institutional change | page = 52 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780415931793 }}</ref> For instance, some white men may see women of color as workers and objects of sexual aggression; this would allow the men to display power and sexual aggression without the emotional attachment that they have to white women.

West and Fenstermaker conclude that doing gender involves different versions of accountability, depending on women's \"relational position\" to white men.<ref name=\"F&W_Accomplish\" />\n\n====Gender as accomplishment====\n\nGender, according to West and Zimmerman, is not simply what one is, but what one does \u2013 it is actively produced within social interactions. Gender is an accomplishment : \"the activity of managing situated conduct in light of normative conceptions of attitudes and activities appropriate for one's sex category\".<ref name=\"West and Zimmerman\" />{{rp|127}} People do not have to be in mixed gender groups or in groups at all for the performance of gender to occur; the production of gender occurs with others and is even performed alone, in the imagined presence of others. [[Doing gender|\"Doing\" gender]] is not just about conforming to stereotypical gender roles \u2013 it is the active engagement in any behavior that is gendered, or behavior that may be evaluated as gendered.\n\nThe performance of gender varies given the context: time, space, social interaction, etc. The enactment of gender roles is context dependent \u2013 roles  are \"situated identities\" instead of \"master identities\".<ref name=\"West and Zimmerman\" />{{rp|131}} The sociology of knowledge must first of all concern itself with what people \"know\" as \"reality\" in their everyday, non- or pre-theoretical lives.

In other words, by doing gender, we reinforce the essential categories of gender \u2013 that there are only two categories that are mutually exclusive. The idea that men and women are essentially different is what makes men and women behave in ways that appear essentially different. Though sex categorization is based on biological sex, it is maintained as a category through socially constructed displays of gender (for example, you could identify a transgender person as female when in fact she is assigned male at birth).\n\nInstitutions also create normative conceptions of gender.

Social constructionism asserts that gender is a category that people evaluate as omnirelevant to social life.<ref>{{cite book | last = Garfinkel | first = Harold | title = Studies in ethnomethodology | publisher = Prentice-Hall | location = Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey | origyear = 1967 | year = 2016 | isbn = 9780745600055 }}</ref> Gender as omnirelevant means that people can always be judged by what they do as a man or as a woman. This is the basis for the reasoning that people are always performing gender and that gender is always relevant in social situations.\n\nAccountability can apply to behaviors that do conform to cultural conceptions as well as those behaviors that deviate \u2013 it is the ''possibility'' of being held accountable that is important in social constructionism. For example, Stobbe examined the rationale that people gave for why there were small numbers of women in the auto industry. Men cited the idea that such dirty work was unsuitable for women and women were unable to train because of family duties. Stobbe argues that the male workers created a [[machismo]] masculinity to distinguish themselves from women who might have been qualified to work in the auto shop. Women who do work in male-dominated professions have to carefully maintain and simultaneously balance their femininity and professional credibility.<ref>{{cite journal |ref=harv |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0432.2005.00265.x |title=Doing Machismo: Legitimating Speech Acts as a Selection Discourse |journal=Gender, Work and Organization |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=105\u2013123 |year=2005 |last1=Stobbe |first1=Lineke |url=http://dare.ubvu.vu.nl/bitstream/1871/33804/1/178738.pdf }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |ref=harv |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0432.2005.00263.x |title=The Third Sex: Women Leaders in Australian Agriculture |journal=Gender, Work and Organization |volume=12 |pages=73\u201388 |year=2005 |last1=Pini |first1=Barbara }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |ref=harv |doi=10.1177/0959353505051728 |title=Making Sense of Gender, Age, Power and Disciplinary Position: Intersecting Discourses in the Academy |journal=Feminism & Psychology |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=189\u2013208 |year=2016 |last1=S\u00f8ndergaard |first1=Dorte Marie }}</ref>\n\nEven though gender seems more salient in some situations \u2013 for instance, when a woman enters a male-dominated profession \u2013 gender categories also become salient in contexts in which gender is less obvious.

This outdated perception, according to Butler, is limiting in that it adheres to the dominant societal constraints that label gender as binary. In scrutinizing gender, Butler introduces a nuanced perception in which she unites the concepts of [[performativity]] and gender. In chapter one of the text, Butler introduces the unification of the terms gender and performativity in stating that \"gender proves to be performance\u2014that is, constituting the identity it is purported to be. In this sense, gender is always a doing, though not a doing by a subject who might be said to pre-exist the deed\".<ref>{{cite book | last = Butler | first = Judith | authorlink = Judith Butler | title = Gender trouble: feminism and the subversion of identity | page = [https://archive.org/details/gendertroublefem00butl/page/25 25] | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | origyear = 1990 | year = 1999 | isbn = 9780415924993 | url = https://archive.org/details/gendertroublefem00butl/page/25 }}</ref> In demystifying this concept, Butler sets out to clarify that there is indeed a difference in the terms gender performance and gender performativity. In doing so, Butler states in an interview: \"When we say that gender is performed, we usually mean that we've taken on a role; we're acting in some way\u2026To say that gender is performative is a little different\u2026For something to be performative means that it produces a series of effects. We act and walk and speak and talk that consolidate an impression of being a man or being a woman\u2026we act as if that being of a man or that being of a woman is actually an internal reality or simply something that is true about us. Actually, it is a phenomenon that is being produced all the time and reproduced all the time.\"<ref>{{cite AV media | people= [[Judith Butler]] | date= 6 June 2011 |accessdate= 22 June 2016 | title= Judith Butler: Your Behavior Creates Your Gender | medium= Video | publisher= [[Big Think]] via [[YouTube]] | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo7o2LYATDc}}</ref> Thus, Butler perceives gender as being constructed through a set of acts that are said to be in compliance with dominant societal norms. Butler is, however, not stating that gender is a sort of performance in which an individual can terminate the act; instead, what Butler is stating is that this performance is ongoing and out of an individual's control. In fact, rather than an individual producing the performance, the opposite is true. The performance is what produces the individual. Specifically, Butler approvingly quotes Nietzsche's claim that \"there is no 'being' behind doing\u2026 'the doer' is merely a fiction added to the deed \u2013 the deed is everything.\"<ref>{{cite book | last = Butler | first = Judith | author-link = Judith Butler | title = Gender trouble: feminism and the subversion of identity | page = 25 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780415389556 }}</ref> Thus, the emphasis is placed not on the individual producing the deed but on the deed itself. Although a seemingly difficult concept to grasp, gender performativity is realized throughout many aspects of our lives, specifically in our infancy and young childhood, our teen years, and finally our adult lives.\n\nOn Butler's hypothesis, the socially constructed aspect of gender performativity is perhaps most obvious in [[Drag (clothing)#Drag kings and queens|drag]] performance, which offers a rudimentary understanding of [[gender binary|gender binaries]] in its emphasis on gender performance. Butler understands drag cannot be regarded as an example of subjective or singular identity, where \"there is a 'one' who is prior to gender, a one who goes to the wardrobe of gender decides with deliberation which gender it will be today\".<ref name=\"GLQ_Butler\">{{Cite journal | last = Butler | first = Judith | author-link = Judith Butler | title = Critically queer | journal = [[GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies]] | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 17&ndash;32 | doi = 10.1215/10642684-1-1-17 | date = November 1993 | ref = harv }}</ref>{{rp|21}} Consequently, drag should not be considered the honest expression of its performer's intent. Rather, Butler suggests that what is performed \"can only be understood through reference to what is barred from the signifier within the domain of corporeal legibility\".<ref name=\"GLQ_Butler\" />{{rp|24}}\n\n[[Amelia Jones]] proposes that this mode of viewing gender offered a way to move beyond the theories of the [[gaze]] and [[sexual fetishism]], which had attained much prominence in academic feminism, but which by the 1980s Jones viewed as outdated methods of understanding women's societal status. Jones believes the performative power to act out gender is extremely useful as a framework, offering new ways to consider images as enactments with embodied subjects rather than inanimate objects for men's viewing pleasure.<ref>{{cite book | editor-last = Jones | editor-first = Amelia | editor-link = Amelia Jones | title = The feminism and visual culture reader | page = [https://archive.org/details/feminismvisualcu0000unse/page/370 370] | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780415267069 | url = https://archive.org/details/feminismvisualcu0000unse/page/370 }}</ref>\n\n===Infancy and young childhood===\n\nThe idea around gender performativity, when applied to infancy and young childhood, deals with the idea that from the moment one is conceived, arguably even before that, who they are and who they will become is predetermined. Children learn at a very young age what it means to be a boy or girl in our society. Individuals are either given masculine or feminine names based on their sex, are assigned colors that are deemed appropriate only when utilized by a particular sex and are even given toys that will aid them in recognizing their proper places in society. According to Barbara Kerr and Karen Multon, many parents would be puzzled to know \"the tendency of little children to think that it is their clothing or toys that make them boy or girl\".<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Kerr | first1 = Barbara A. | last2 = Multon | first2 = Karen D. | title = The development of gender identity, gender roles, and gender relations in gifted students | journal = [[Journal of Counseling & Development]] | volume = 93 | issue = 2 | page = 183 | doi = 10.1002/j.1556-6676.2015.00194.x | date = April 2015 | ref = harv }}</ref> Parents are going as far as coordinating their daughter with the color pink because it's feminine, or blue for their son because it's masculine.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Witt |first1=Susan D. |title=Parental Influence on Children's Socialization to Gender Roles |url=http://gozips.uakron.edu/~susan8/parinf.htm |accessdate=16 July 2018 |date=1997}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">http://gozips.uakron.edu/~susan8/parinf.htm</ref> In discussing these points, Penelope Eckert, in her text titled ''Language and Gender'', states: \"the first thing people want to know about a baby is its sex, and social convention provides a myriad of props to reduce the necessity of asking\".<ref name=\"Language and Gender\">{{cite book | last1 = Eckert | first1 = Penelope | last2 = McConnell-Ginet | first2 = Sally | title = Language and gender | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge New York | year = 2013 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9781107659360 }}</ref> Thus, this reinforces the importance and emphasis that society places not only on sex but also on ways in which to point towards one's sex without implicitly doing so. Eckert furthers this in stating that determining sex at one's birth is also vital of how one presents themselves in society at an older age because \"sex determination sets the stage for a lifelong process of gendering\".<ref name=\"Language and Gender\"/> Eckert's statement points to Judith Butler's view of gender as being performative. Similar to Butler, Eckert is hinting to the fact that gender is not an internal reality that cannot be changed. What Eckert is instead stating is that this is a common misconception that a majority of the population unknowingly reinforces, which sees its emergence during infancy.\n\nButler suggests in both \"Critically Queer\" and \"Melancholy Gender\",<ref>{{cite book | last = Butler | first = Judith | authorlink = Judith Butler | title = The psychic life of power: theories in subjection | publisher = Stanford University Press | location = Stanford, California | year = 1997 | isbn = 9780804728126 }}</ref> that the child/subject's ability to grieve the loss of the same-sex parent as a viable love object is barred. Following from [[Sigmund Freud]]'s notion of [[melancholia]], such a repudiation results in a heightened identification with the Other that cannot be loved, resulting in gender performances which create allegories of, and internalize the lost love that the subject is subsequently unable to acknowledge or grieve. Butler explains that \"a masculine gender is formed from the refusal to grieve the masculine as a possibility of love; a feminine gender is formed (taken on, assumed) through the fantasy which the feminine is excluded as a possible object of love, an exclusion never grieved, but 'preserved' through the heightening of feminine identification itself\".<ref name=\"GLQ_Butler\" />{{rp|25}}\n\n===Teen years===\n\nOne's teen years are the prime time in which socialization occurs as well as the time in which how one presents themselves in society is of high concern. Often, this is the time in which one's ability to master their gender performance labels them as successful, and thus normal, or unsuccessful, and thus strange and unfitting. One of the sources that demonstrate how successful performance is acted out is magazines, specifically magazines targeting young girls. According to Eckert, \"When we are teenagers, the teen magazines told girls how to make conversation with boys\u2026\".<ref name=\"Language and Gender\" />{{rp|275}} This not only emphasizes the fact that gender is something that is taught to us and is continuously being shaped by society's expectations, but it also points to one of the ways in which individuals are being subconsciously trained to be ideal participants in the gender binary. Thus calling back to Butler's perception that gender is not a fact about us but is something that is taught to us and is being constantly reinforced. This idea that gender is constantly shaped by expectations is relevant in the online community. Teenagers are easily able to formulate relationships and friendships online, thus increasing the probability of a teenager's delicate identity to be manipulated and distorted.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Valkenburg|first=Patti M.|last2=Peter|first2=Jochen|date=February 2011|title=Online Communication Among Adolescents: An Integrated Model of Its Attraction, Opportunities, and Risks|journal=Journal of Adolescent Health|volume=48|issue=2|pages=121\u2013127|doi=10.1016/j.jadohealth.2010.08.020|pmid=21257109|issn=1054-139X}}</ref> Teenagers often come across situations in real life and online that cause them to question themselves when facing society, including gender performance.\n\n<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=B.

This model diverges from the hegemonic analytical framework of gender that many claim is [[Heteronormativity|heteronormative]], contending with the ways in which queer actors problematize the traditional construction of gender. Butler adapts the psychoanalytical term of melancholia to conceptualize homoerotic subtext as it exists in western literature and especially the relationship between women writers, their gender, and their sexuality. Melancholia deals with mourning, but for homosexual couples it is not just mourning the death of the relationship, instead it is the societal disavowal of the relationship itself and the ability to mourn, thus leading to repression of these feelings.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McIvor|first=David W.|date=2012|title=Bringing Ourselves to Grief: Judith Butler and the Politics of Mourning|journal=Political Theory|volume=40|issue=4|pages=409\u2013436|jstor=41703076|doi=10.1177/0090591712444841}}</ref> This idea is reflected in the activism of organized by political groups such as [[ACT UP]] during the AIDS crisis. Many of the survivors that participated in this activism were homosexuals whom has lost their partners to the disease.

Students regularly take part in policing gender boundaries through bullying. Male students frequently harass male and female students, while female students generally only harass other female students.

Overall, gender-based harassment serves to define and enforce gender boundaries of students by students.\n\n===Adolescent view of adulthood===\n\nGender is a [[cultural]] construction which creates an environment where an adolescent's performance in high school is related to their life goals and expectations. Because some young women believe that they want to be mothers and wives, the choice of professions and future goals can be inherently flawed by the gender constraints.  Because a girl may want to be a mother later, her academics in high school can create clear [[gender difference]]s because \"higher occupational expectations, educational expectations, and academic grades were more strongly associated with the expected age of parenthood for girls than for boys\".<ref name=\"Crockett, Lisa J. 2012\">{{cite journal | last1 = Crockett | first1 = Lisa J. | last2 = Beal | first2 = Sarah J. | title = The life course in the making: gender and the development of adolescents' expected timing of adult role transitions | journal = [[Developmental Psychology (journal)|Developmental Psychology]] | volume = 48 | issue = 6 | pages = 1727&ndash;1738 | doi = 10.1037/a0027538 | pmid = 22448985 | date = November 2012 | ref = harv }}</ref> With \"young women recognizing potential conflicts between the demands of work and family\", they will not try as hard in high school allowing males to achieve higher academic achievement then girls.

Women especially are constrained in the way they view their adulthood even at a young age because of [[motherhood]].\n\nMales can also be subject to gender construction due to social expectations of masculinity. According to [[Jack Halberstam]] (under the name Judith), people correlate masculinity with \"maleness and to power to domination\u201d, something that he believes is a result of patriarchy.<ref>{{cite book | last = Halberstam | first = Judith | title = Female masculinity | publisher = Duke University Press | location = Durham | year = 1998 | language = en | url = https://archive.org/details/femalemasculinit00judi | isbn = 9780822322436 | url-access = registration }}</ref> In a 2015 study published in the ''[[American Journal of Public Health]]'', researchers stated that gender construct can differ depending on the man's race or ethnicity and stated that for white men there was an emphasis on \"education,employment, and socioeconomic status\" whereas the expectations for black men focused on \"sexual prowess, physical dominance, and gamesmanship\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Fields |first=Errol Lamont |last2=Bogart |first2=Laura M. |last3=Smith |first3=Katherine C. |last4=Malebranche |first4=David J. |last5=Ellen |first5=Jonathan |last6=Schuster |first6=Mark A. | title = \"I always felt I had to prove my manhood\": homosexuality, masculinity, gender role strain, and HIV risk among young Black men who have sex with men | journal = [[American Journal of Public Health]] | volume = 105 | issue = 1 | pages = 122&ndash;131 | doi = 10.2105/ajph.2013.301866 | pmid = 24832150 | date = January 2015 | ref = harv | pmc=4265897}}</ref> These expectations can make it harder for males to display emotions without receiving criticism and being seen as less of a man.\n\nAdolescents view on [[adulthood]] is also determined by their employment in high school.

Mortimer explains \"youth who work during high school, and those who devote more hours to work, are more [[vocation]]ally successful after leaving high school\".<ref name=\"Mortimer 2005\" /> This creates a distinct gender difference in which men are more likely to be employed after high school than women if they have worked during high school.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Marsh | first = Herbert W. | title = Employment during high school: character building or a subversion of academic goals? | journal = [[Sociology of Education (journal)|Sociology of Education]] | volume = 64 | issue = 3 | pages = 172&ndash;189 | doi = 10.2307/2112850 | jstor = 2112850 | date = July 1991 | ref = harv }}</ref> This means women may be at an academic advantage if they do not work in high school and focus on school work.\n\n===Depression===\n\nHigh school continues to become a more high-pressure environment with academic and social triggers increasing the expectations of adolescents. High school is a large transitional period for teenagers causing them to \"cope with these various transitions in different ways; some negotiate the passages easily whereas others develop serious behavioral and psychological problems\".<ref name=\"Negriff, Sonya 2011\">{{cite journal | last1 = Negriff | first1 = Sonya | last2 = Susman | first2 = Elizabeth J. | title = Pubertal timing, depression, and externalizing problems: a framework, review, and examination of gender differences | journal = [[Journal of Research on Adolescence]] | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 717&ndash;746 | doi = 10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00708.x | date = September 2011 | ref = harv }}</ref> One of these psychological problems is [[Depression (mood)|depression]].  While the environment of high school can be stressful biological functions also play a large role is [[psychological well-being]].

Higher levels of [[testosterone]] are associated with increased [[aggression]] in boys and girls, whereas higher [[estrogen]] for girls is associated with increased depressive symptoms\".<ref name=\"Negriff, Sonya 2011\"/> The gender differences observed may not just be due to the cultural expectations, but rather a biological function of the sex the individuals are born with. Self-esteem has also been linked to depression in high school students. One study done by James Battle in 1980 took 26 student ages 15\u201318 showed a correlation between depression and self-esteem.<ref name=\"Battle\">{{cite journal | last = Battle | first = James | title = Relationship between self-esteem and depression among high school students | journal = [[Perceptual and Motor Skills]] | volume = 51 | issue = 1 | pages = 157&ndash;158 | doi = 10.2466/pms.1980.51.1.157 | pmid = 7432952 | date = June 1980 | ref = harv }}</ref>  In the 80s, research had not looked past adults and Battle's research was some of the first of its kind which showed a direct correlation between self-esteem and depression.<ref name=\"Battle\" /> [[Self-esteem]] is not a product of our biology but rather is culturally constructed.<ref name=\"Battle\" /> Girls in high school also tend to have lower self-esteem due to body image.<ref name=\"Gram 2000\">{{cite journal | last1 = Graham | first1 = Melody A. | last2 = Eich | first2 = Carla | last3 = Kephart | first3 = Becky | last4 = Peterson | first4 = Dawn | title = Relationship among body image, sex, and popularity of high school students | journal = [[Perceptual and Motor Skills]] | volume = 90 | issue = 3s | pages = 1187&ndash;1193 | doi = 10.2466/pms.2000.90.3c.1187 | pmid = 10939068 | date = June 2000 | ref = harv }}</ref> With depression and self-esteem being so closely linked the potential for having the disease can result in an educational experience which can be compromised. [[Depression (mood)|Depression]] can be isolating, and without proper academics and societal support, high school can be challenging. Along with higher rates of [[self-esteem]] issues in adolescents, this can adversely affect girls' academics and social life in high school.\n\n===Body image===\n\nThere are many different factors that affect [[body image]], \"including [[sex]], [[mass media|media]], parental relationship, and [[puberty]] as well as weight and popularity\".<ref name=\"Gram 2000\"/> The [[intersectionality]] of these factors causes individualistic experiences for adolescents during this period within their lives. As their body changes, so does the environment in which they live in. Body image is closely linked to [[psychological well-being]] during adolescence and can cause harmful effects when a child has body dissatisfaction.<ref name=\"Winefield\">{{cite journal | last1 = Delfabbro | first1 = Paul H. | last2 = Winefield | first2 = Anthony H. | last3 = Anderson | first3 = Sarah | last4 = Hammarstr\u00f6m | first4 = Anne | last5 = Winefield | first5 = Helen | title = Body image and psychological well-being in adolescents: the relationship between gender and school type | journal = [[The Journal of Genetic Psychology]] | volume = 172 | issue = 1 | pages = 67&ndash;83 | doi = 10.1080/00221325.2010.517812 | pmid = 21452753 | date = 2011 | ref = harv }}</ref> In the article \"Body Image and Psychological Well-Being in Adolescents: The Relationship between Gender and School Type\", Helen Winfield explains that an adolescent's high school experience is closely linked to their perceived [[body image]]. She analyzed over 336 teenagers and found \"ratings of [[physical attractiveness]] and body image remain relatively stable across the early teenage years, but become increasingly negative around age 15\u201318 years because of pubertal changes\".<ref name=\"Winefield\" /> This shift during the high school years may cause serious psychological problems for adolescents.  These psychological problems can manifest into eating disorders causing serious lifelong problems.<ref name=\"Winefield\" /> Due to these findings, it is shown that these body image issues are especially prevalent in girls but as boys enter [[puberty]], expectations of height and muscle mass change as well.  Geoffrey H. Cohane, Harrison G. Pope Jr. in their article, \"Body image in boys: A review of the literature,\" claim that \"girls typically wanted to be thinner, boys frequently wanted to be bigger\".<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cohane | first1 = Geoffrey H. | last2 = Pope | first2 =  Harrison G. | title = Body image in boys: A review of the literature | journal = International Journal of Eating Disorders | volume = 29 | issue = 4 | pages = 373&ndash;379 | doi = 10.1002/eat.1033 | pmid = 11285574 | date = May 2001 | ref = harv }}</ref> This statistic displays that gender difference in body image cause different beauty ideals.

These images often act as an extreme expectation for many developing teenagers.\n\nMen are typically portrayed as assertive, powerful, and strong. Particularly in television, men are usually shown as being nonemotional and detached. Women are often portrayed as the opposite. Gender roles are generally more enforced for women in media than they are for men.

Social constructionists recognize that every researcher has an opinion and is biased in some way. They acknowledge that their own views and findings/results of a study are open to deconstructive critique \u2013 no grand truth can be found because everything is context-specific and has potential to change across time periods and different situations.

People are often convinced that there are inherent differences between men and women, which skews both studies and their findings.

The [[First-wave feminism|first wave]], which began in 1854{{where|date=June 2016}}, was a fight for women's rights to education and to the vote by the [[suffragette]]s. This movement was then followed by [[Second-wave feminism]] and [[Third-wave feminism]] which furthered the feminist cause. The feminist movement was not only about fighting for women's rights, but more essentially about earning recognition and respect from the general public acknowledging the fact that they are not inferior than men and thus deserving to be treated equally and granted fair opportunities.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Feminism emerged and started to challenge the idea that a woman's appropriate place was confined to that of the domestic and private sphere. Over time, men and women's attitudes have been becoming more liberalized with regard to gender roles. Men and women are agreeing on a more egalitarian responsibility distribution within the family sphere.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} They are also in agreement that women should and can have roles in the public sphere, especially in leadership positions and that men can have and involved role in the private and domestic sphere.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Bolzendahl | first1 = Catherine I. | last2 = Myers | first2 = Daniel J. | title = Feminist attitudes and support for gender equality: opinion change in women and men, 1974-1998 | journal = [[Social Forces]] | volume = 83 | issue = 2 | pages = 759&ndash;789 | doi = 10.1353/sof.2005.0005 | jstor = 3598347 | date = December 2004 | ref = harv }} [https://inequality.stanford.edu/printpdf/4595 Pdf.]</ref> These markers of increasingly liberalized attitudes toward gender roles indicate the trajectory of social change in terms of what is deemed normative.\n\n===Criticism and opportunities to \"undo\" gender===\n{{Further|Undoing Gender}}\nBecause the theory says that one can \"do\" gender whether they conform to [[gender norm]]s or not (and is always held accountable for behaving in accordance with gender norms), change seems impossible. If essential differences between the sexes are problematic, a society where gender is omnirelevant could be argued to always uphold gender inequality. The language of \"doing\" gender implies doing difference instead of unraveling it. Most studies that rely on social constructionism explore the ways in which gender is constructed but nevertheless demonstrate how those gender constructions uphold gender as a construct and gender inequality.\n\nHowever, because gender is \"done\" or constructed, it can also be \"undone\" or deconstructed.<ref name=\"Deutsch\"/> The study of the interactional level could expand beyond simply documenting the persistence of inequality to examine: (1) when and how social interactions become less gendered, not just differently gendered, (2) the conditions under which gender is irrelevant in social interactions, (3) whether all gendered interactions reinforce inequality, (4) how the structural (institutional) and interactional levels might work together to produce change, and (5) interaction as the site of change.<ref name=\"Deutsch\"/>\n\n===Nature versus nurture===\n{{See also|Gender role#Biological factors}}\nTheories that imply that gendered behavior is totally or mostly due to social conventions and culture fall into the nurture end of the [[nature versus nurture]] debate. Much empirical research has been done on to what extent gendered behavior stems from biological factors.\n\n==See also==\n{{Wiktionary|social constructionism}}\n{{Wiktionary|gender}}\n* [[Detransition]]\n* [[Gender studies]]\n* [[Heterosexism]]\n* [[Homophobia]]\n* [[Sexism]]\n* [[Transphobia]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0277-9536(99)00390-1 |pmid=10741575 |title=Constructions of masculinity and their influence on men's well-being: A theory of gender and health |journal=Social Science & Medicine |volume=50 |issue=10 |pages=1385\u20131401 |year=2000 |last1=Courtenay |first1=Will H |url=http://pingpong.ki.se/public/pp/public_courses/course07443/published/1295951502373/resourceId/4292165/content/courtenay&#91;1&#93;.pdf |citeseerx=10.1.1.462.4452 }}\n\n{{Gender and sexual identities}}\n\n[[Category:Gender roles]]\n[[Category:Social constructionism|Gender]]\n[[Category:Feminist theory]]\n", "name_user": "Azeranth", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added missed citations, as well as readability/tone/grammar details", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_construction_of_gender"}

In 1999, Anderson received the first [[Linda McCartney]] Memorial Award for animal rights protectors, in recognition of her campaign. In 2003, Anderson stripped down for PETA's \"I'd Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur\" advertising campaign. On June 28, 2006, Anderson posed naked with other protesters on a window display of the [[Stella McCartney]] boutique in London, England. It was a PETA gala event before the PETA Humanitarian Awards. Anderson went inside the boutique and said she would take her clothes off if the event raised enough money for PETA, which it did. She campaigned against [[KFC|Kentucky Fried Chicken]]. In 2001, Anderson released a letter in support of PETA's campaign against Kentucky Fried Chicken, stating \"What KFC does to 750 million chickens each year is not civilized or acceptable.\" She later made a video about KFC's treatment of chickens.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.KentuckyFriedCruelty.com|title=Kentuckey Fried Cruelty|accessdate=February 26, 2007}}</ref> In January 2006, Anderson requested that the [[Governor of Kentucky]] remove a bust of [[Colonel Sanders]], the founder of KFC, from display but her request was refused even when she offered her own bust in exchange. In February 2006, Anderson decided to [[boycott]] the [[Kentucky Derby]] because of its support for Kentucky Fried Chicken.\n\n[[File:Pamela Anderson FBB Chasse aux phoques 14 f\u00e9vrier 2008 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Anderson is a prominent activist for the animal rights movement.]]\nShe has also campaigned against [[seal hunting]] in Canada. In March 2006, Anderson asked to speak to [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]] about the [[Canada's annual seal hunt|annual seal hunt]] but was refused. In May 2006, she petitioned individuals on the street for their opinion on the Canadian Seal Hunt. In December 2009, Anderson, photographed in a T-shirt with a drawn picture of a seal pup on it, was featured in a new ad campaign for PETA. She appears next to the headline \"Save the Seals\" in the ad and urges the public to help end \"Canada's annual seal slaughter.\" She joined forces with the organization again in a campaign for the boycott of fruit-juice maker [[POM Wonderful|POM]]. The \"Pom Horrible Campaign\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://getactive.peta.org/campaign/pam_vs_pom?qp_source=pamvspomgen?c=pvpwiki|title=PETA|accessdate=July 21, 2009}}</ref> has resulted in the company halting [[Animal testing|animal tests]].\n\nAnderson became the center of controversy when she posed in a bikini nearly nude for a PETA ad that was banned in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], on grounds that the ad was sexist. Anderson retorted saying, \"In a city that is known for its exotic dancing and for being progressive and edgy, how sad that a woman would be banned from using her own body in a political protest over the suffering of cows and chickens. In some parts of the world, women are forced to cover their whole bodies with [[burqa]]s \u2013 is that next?

In 1999, Anderson received the first [[Linda McCartney]] Memorial Award for animal rights protectors, in recognition of her campaign. In 2003, Anderson stripped down for PETA's \"I'd Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur\" advertising campaign. On June 28, 2006, Anderson posed naked with other protesters on a window display of the [[Stella McCartney]] boutique in London, England. It was a PETA gala event before the PETA Humanitarian Awards. Anderson went inside the boutique and said she would take her clothes off if the event raised enough money for PETA, which it did. She campaigned against [[KFC|Kentucky Fried Chicken]]. In 2001, Anderson released a letter in support of PETA's campaign against Kentucky Fried Chicken, stating \"What KFC does to 750 million chickens each year is not civilized or acceptable.\" She later made a video about KFC's treatment of chickens.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.KentuckyFriedCruelty.com|title=Kentuckey Fried Cruelty|accessdate=February 26, 2007}}</ref> In January 2006, Anderson requested that the [[Governor of Kentucky]] remove a bust of [[Colonel Sanders]], the founder of KFC, from display but her request was refused even when she offered her own bust in exchange. In February 2006, Anderson decided to [[boycott]] the [[Kentucky Derby]] because of its support for Kentucky Fried Chicken.\n\n[[File:Pamela Anderson FBB Chasse aux phoques 14 f\u00e9vrier 2008 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Anderson is a prominent activist for the animal rights movement.]]\nShe has also campaigned against [[seal hunting]] in Canada. In March 2006, Anderson asked to speak to [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]] about the [[Canada's annual seal hunt|annual seal hunt]] but was refused. In May 2006, she petitioned individuals on the street for their opinion on the Canadian Seal Hunt. In December 2009, Anderson, photographed in a T-shirt with a drawn picture of a seal pup on it, was featured in a new ad campaign for PETA. She appears next to the headline \"Save the Seals\" in the ad and urges the public to help end \"Canada's annual seal slaughter.\" She joined forces with the organization again in a campaign for the boycott of fruit-juice maker [[POM Wonderful|POM]]. The \"Pom Horrible Campaign\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://getactive.peta.org/campaign/pam_vs_pom?qp_source=pamvspomgen?c=pvpwiki|title=PETA|accessdate=July 21, 2009}}</ref> has resulted in the company halting [[Animal testing|animal tests]].\n\nAnderson became the center of controversy when she posed in a bikini nearly nude for a PETA ad that was banned in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], on grounds that the ad was sexist. Anderson retorted saying, \"In a city that is known for its exotic dancing and for being progressive and edgy, how sad that a woman would be banned from using her own body in a political protest over the suffering of cows and chickens. In some parts of the world, women are forced to cover their whole bodies with [[burqa]]s \u2013 is that next?

Harris had an important collection of Spanish prints, especially those of [[Goya]], which was mostly acquired by the [[British Museum]] after his death.

The study of oscillation modes in accretion disks is referred to as '''diskoseismology'''.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last1=Nowak |first1=Michael A.\n |last2=Wagoner |first2=Robert V.\n |date=1991\n |title=Diskoseismology: Probing accretion disks.

These jets are invoked by astronomers to do everything from getting rid of angular momentum in a forming star to reionizing the universe (in [[active galactic nucleus|active galactic nuclei]]), but their origin is still not well understood.}}\n\nAccretion disks are a ubiquitous phenomenon in astrophysics; [[active galactic nuclei]], [[protoplanetary disk]]s, and [[gamma ray burst]]s all involve accretion disks. These disks very often give rise to [[astrophysical jet]]s coming from the vicinity of the central object. Jets are an efficient way for the star-disk system to shed [[angular momentum]] without losing too much [[mass]].\n\nThe most spectacular accretion disks found in nature are those of [[active galactic nuclei]] and of [[quasars]], which are thought to be massive black holes at the center of galaxies. As matter enters the accretion disc, it follows a trajectory called a [[tendex line]], which describes an inward spiral. This is because particles rub and bounce against each other in a turbulent flow, causing frictional heating which radiates energy away, reducing the particles' angular momentum, allowing the particle to drift inwards, driving the inward spiral. The loss of angular momentum manifests as a reduction in velocity; at a slower velocity, the particle wants to adopt a lower orbit. As the particle falls to this lower orbit, a portion of its gravitational potential energy is converted to increased velocity and the particle gains speed. Thus, the particle has lost energy even though it is now travelling faster than before; however, it has lost angular momentum. As a particle orbits closer and closer, its velocity increases, as velocity increases frictional heating increases as more and more of the particle's potential energy (relative to the black hole) is radiated away; the accretion disk of a black hole is hot enough to emit [[X-ray]]s just outside the [[event horizon]]. The large [[luminosity]] of quasars is believed to be a result of gas being accreted by supermassive black holes.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last1=Lynden-Bell |first1=D.\n |date=1969\n |title=Galactic Nuclei as Collapsed Old Quasars\n |journal=Nature\n |volume=280 |issue= 5207|pages=690\u2013694\n |bibcode=1969Natur.223..690L\n |doi=10.1038/223690a0\n}}</ref> Elliptical accretion disks formed at tidal disruption of stars can be typical in galactic nuclei and quasars.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last1=Gurzadyan |first1=V.

Angular momentum conservation prevents a straight flow from one star to the other and an accretion disk forms instead.\n\nAccretion disks surrounding [[T Tauri star]]s or [[Herbig Ae/Be stars|Herbig star]]s are called [[protoplanetary disk]]s because they are thought to be the progenitors of [[planetary system]]s.

If matter is to fall inwards it must lose not only gravitational energy but also lose [[angular momentum]]. Since the total angular momentum of the disk is conserved, the angular momentum loss of the mass falling into the center has to be compensated by an angular momentum gain of the mass far from the center. In other words, angular momentum should be ''transported'' outwards for matter to accrete.

In a Keplerian disk the inner fluid element would be orbiting more rapidly than the outer, causing the spring to stretch. The inner fluid element is then forced by the spring to slow down, reduce correspondingly its angular momentum causing it to move to a lower orbit.

It is geometrically thin in the vertical direction (has a disk-like shape), and is made of a relatively cold gas, with a negligible radiation pressure. The gas goes down on very tight spirals, resembling almost circular, almost free (Keplerian) orbits. Thin disks are relatively luminous and they have thermal electromagnetic spectra, i.e. not much different from that of a sum of black bodies. Radiative cooling is very efficient in thin disks. The classic 1974 work by Shakura and Sunyaev on thin accretion disks is one of the most often quoted papers in modern astrophysics. Thin disks were independently worked out by Lynden-Bell, Pringle and Rees. Pringle contributed in the past thirty years many key results to accretion disk theory, and wrote the classic 1981 review that for many years was the main source of information about accretion disks, and is still very useful today.\n[[File: CNRSblackhole.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Simulation by J.A.

Due to light bending, the disk appears distorted but is nowhere hidden by the black hole.\n\nWhen the accretion rate is sub-Eddington and the opacity very low, an ADAF is formed. This type of accretion disk was predicted in 1977 by Ichimaru. Although Ichimaru's paper was largely ignored, some elements of the ADAF model were present in the influential 1982 ion-tori paper by Rees, Phinney, Begelman and Blandford.\nADAFs started to be intensely studied by many authors only after their rediscovery in the mid-1990 by Narayan and Yi, and independently by Abramowicz, Chen, Kato, Lasota (who coined the name ADAF), and Regev. Most important contributions to astrophysical applications of ADAFs have been made by Narayan and his collaborators. ADAFs are cooled by advection (heat captured in matter) rather than by radiation. They are very radiatively inefficient, geometrically extended, similar in shape to a sphere (or a \"corona\") rather than a disk, and very hot (close to the virial temperature). Because of their low efficiency, ADAFs are much less luminous than the Shakura-Sunyaev thin disks. ADAFs emit a power-law, non-thermal radiation, often with a strong Compton component.\n{{multiple image\n| header    =<center>Blurring of an X-ray source (corona) near a [[Black hole]].</center>\n| align     = center\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Black Holes - Monsters in Space.jpg\n| width1    = 420\n| caption1  = Black hole with corona, an X-ray source (artist's concept).<ref name=\"NASA-20140812\">{{cite web |last=Clavin |first=Whitney |last2=Harrington |first2=J.D. |title=NASA's NuSTAR Sees Rare Blurring of Black Hole Light |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-273 |date=12 August 2014 |website=[[NASA]] |accessdate=12 August 2014 }}</ref>\n| image2    = PIA18467-NuSTAR-Plot-BlackHole-BlursLight-20140812.png\n| width2    = 300\n| caption2  = Blurring of X-rays near Black hole ([[NuSTAR]]; 12 August 2014).<ref name=\"NASA-20140812\" />\n| footer    = <p style=\"text-align:right;\">Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech</p>\n}}\n\n== Analytic models of super-Eddington accretion disks (slim disks, Polish doughnuts) ==\nThe theory of highly super-Eddington black hole accretion, ''M''\u226b''M''<sub>Edd</sub>, was developed in the 1980s by Abramowicz, Jaroszynski, [[Bohdan Paczy\u0144ski|Paczy\u0144ski]], Sikora and others in terms of \"Polish doughnuts\" (the name was coined by Rees). Polish doughnuts are low viscosity, optically thick, radiation pressure supported accretion disks cooled by [[advection]]. They are radiatively very inefficient. Polish doughnuts resemble in shape a fat torus (a doughnut) with two narrow funnels along the rotation axis. The funnels collimate the radiation into beams with highly super-Eddington luminosities.\n\nSlim disks (name coined by Kolakowska) have only moderately super-Eddington accretion rates,\n''M''\u2265''M''<sub>Edd</sub>, rather disk-like shapes, and almost thermal spectra. They are cooled by advection, and are radiatively ineffective.

The central body is typically a [[star]]. [[Friction]] causes orbiting material in the disk to spiral inward towards the central body. Gravitational and frictional forces compress and raise the temperature of the material, causing the emission of [[electromagnetic radiation]].

These jets are invoked by astronomers to do everything from getting rid of angular momentum in a forming star to reionizing the universe (in [[active galactic nucleus|active galactic nuclei]]), but their origin is still not well understood.}}\n\nAccretion disks are a ubiquitous phenomenon in astrophysics; [[active galactic nuclei]], [[protoplanetary disk]]s, and [[gamma ray burst]]s all involve accretion disks. These disks very often give rise to [[astrophysical jet]]s coming from the vicinity of the central object. Jets are an efficient way for the star-disk system to shed [[angular momentum]] without losing too much [[mass]].\n\nThe most spectacular accretion disks found in nature are those of [[active galactic nuclei]] and of [[quasars]], which are thought to be massive black holes at the center of galaxies. As matter enters the accretion disc, it follows a trajectory called a [[tendex line]], which describes an inward spiral. This is because particles rub and bounce against each other in a turbulent flow, causing frictional heating which radiates energy away, reducing the particles' angular momentum, allowing the particle to drift inwards, driving the inward spiral. The loss of angular momentum manifests as a reduction in velocity; at a slower velocity, the particle wants to adopt a lower orbit. As the particle falls to this lower orbit, a portion of its gravitational potential energy is converted to increased velocity and the particle gains speed. Thus, the particle has lost energy even though it is now travelling faster than before; however, it has lost angular momentum. As a particle orbits closer and closer, its velocity increases, as velocity increases frictional heating increases as more and more of the particle's potential energy (relative to the black hole) is radiated away; the accretion disk of a black hole is hot enough to emit [[X-ray]]s just outside the [[event horizon]]. The large [[luminosity]] of quasars is believed to be a result of gas being accreted by supermassive black holes.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last1=Lynden-Bell |first1=D.\n |date=1969\n |title=Galactic Nuclei as Collapsed Old Quasars\n |journal=Nature\n |volume=280 |issue= 5207|pages=690\u2013694\n |bibcode=1969Natur.223..690L\n |doi=10.1038/223690a0\n}}</ref> Elliptical accretion disks formed at tidal disruption of stars can be typical in galactic nuclei and quasars.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last1=Gurzadyan |first1=V.

Angular momentum conservation prevents a straight flow from one star to the other and an accretion disk forms instead.\n\nAccretion disks surrounding [[T Tauri star]]s or [[Herbig Ae/Be stars|Herbig star]]s are called [[protoplanetary disk]]s because they are thought to be the progenitors of [[planetary system]]s.

If matter is to fall inwards it must lose not only gravitational energy but also lose [[angular momentum]]. Since the total angular momentum of the disk is conserved, the angular momentum loss of the mass falling into the center has to be compensated by an angular momentum gain of the mass far from the center. In other words, angular momentum should be ''transported'' outwards for matter to accrete.

This prevents the existence of a [[Fluid dynamics|hydrodynamic]] mechanism for angular momentum transport.\n\nOn one hand, it was clear that viscous stresses would eventually cause the matter towards the center to heat up and radiate away some of its gravitational energy. On the other hand, [[viscosity]] itself was not enough to explain the transport of angular momentum to the exterior parts of the disk. [[Turbulence]]-enhanced viscosity was the mechanism thought to be responsible for such angular-momentum redistribution, although the origin of the turbulence itself was not well understood.

Two radially neighboring fluid elements will behave as two mass points connected by a massless spring, the spring tension playing the role of the magnetic tension. In a Keplerian disk the inner fluid element would be orbiting more rapidly than the outer, causing the spring to stretch. The inner fluid element is then forced by the spring to slow down, reduce correspondingly its angular momentum causing it to move to a lower orbit. The outer fluid element being pulled forward will speed up, increasing its angular momentum and move to a larger radius orbit.

It is geometrically thin in the vertical direction (has a disk-like shape), and is made of a relatively cold gas, with a negligible radiation pressure. The gas goes down on very tight spirals, resembling almost circular, almost free (Keplerian) orbits. Thin disks are relatively luminous and they have thermal electromagnetic spectra, i.e. not much different from that of a sum of black bodies. Radiative cooling is very efficient in thin disks. The classic 1974 work by Shakura and Sunyaev on thin accretion disks is one of the most often quoted papers in modern astrophysics. Thin disks were independently worked out by Lynden-Bell, Pringle and Rees. Pringle contributed in the past thirty years many key results to accretion disk theory, and wrote the classic 1981 review that for many years was the main source of information about accretion disks, and is still very useful today.\n[[File: CNRSblackhole.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Simulation by J.A.

Due to light bending, the disk appears distorted but is nowhere hidden by the black hole.\n\nWhen the accretion rate is sub-Eddington and the opacity very low, an ADAF is formed. This type of accretion disk was predicted in 1977 by Ichimaru. Although Ichimaru's paper was largely ignored, some elements of the ADAF model were present in the influential 1982 ion-tori paper by Rees, Phinney, Begelman and Blandford.\nADAFs started to be intensely studied by many authors only after their rediscovery in the mid-1990 by Narayan and Yi, and independently by Abramowicz, Chen, Kato, Lasota (who coined the name ADAF), and Regev. Most important contributions to astrophysical applications of ADAFs have been made by Narayan and his collaborators. ADAFs are cooled by advection (heat captured in matter) rather than by radiation. They are very radiatively inefficient, geometrically extended, similar in shape to a sphere (or a \"corona\") rather than a disk, and very hot (close to the virial temperature). Because of their low efficiency, ADAFs are much less luminous than the Shakura-Sunyaev thin disks. ADAFs emit a power-law, non-thermal radiation, often with a strong Compton component.\n{{multiple image\n| header    =<center>Blurring of an X-ray source (corona) near a [[Black hole]].</center>\n| align     = center\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Black Holes - Monsters in Space.jpg\n| width1    = 420\n| caption1  = Black hole with corona, an X-ray source (artist's concept).<ref name=\"NASA-20140812\">{{cite web |last=Clavin |first=Whitney |last2=Harrington |first2=J.D. |title=NASA's NuSTAR Sees Rare Blurring of Black Hole Light |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-273 |date=12 August 2014 |website=[[NASA]] |accessdate=12 August 2014 }}</ref>\n| image2    = PIA18467-NuSTAR-Plot-BlackHole-BlursLight-20140812.png\n| width2    = 300\n| caption2  = Blurring of X-rays near Black hole ([[NuSTAR]]; 12 August 2014).<ref name=\"NASA-20140812\" />\n| footer    = <p style=\"text-align:right;\">Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech</p>\n}}\n\n== Analytic models of super-Eddington accretion disks (slim disks, Polish doughnuts) ==\nThe theory of highly super-Eddington black hole accretion, ''M''\u226b''M''<sub>Edd</sub>, was developed in the 1980s by Abramowicz, Jaroszynski, [[Bohdan Paczy\u0144ski|Paczy\u0144ski]], Sikora and others in terms of \"Polish doughnuts\" (the name was coined by Rees). Polish doughnuts are low viscosity, optically thick, radiation pressure supported accretion disks cooled by [[advection]]. They are radiatively very inefficient. Polish doughnuts resemble in shape a fat torus (a doughnut) with two narrow funnels along the rotation axis. The funnels collimate the radiation into beams with highly super-Eddington luminosities.\n\nSlim disks (name coined by Kolakowska) have only moderately super-Eddington accretion rates,\n''M''\u2265''M''<sub>Edd</sub>, rather disk-like shapes, and almost thermal spectra. They are cooled by advection, and are radiatively ineffective. They were introduced by Abramowicz, Lasota, Czerny and Szuszkiewicz in 1988.\n\n{{unsolved|physics|Accretion disk QPO's: [[Quasi-periodic oscillation|Quasi-Periodic Oscillations]] happen in many accretion disks, with their periods appearing to scale as the inverse of the mass of the central object.
