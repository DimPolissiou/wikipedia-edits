{"title_page": "Erik Laxmann", "text_new": "[[File:Laxman full.png|thumb|Erik Gustavovich Laxmann]]\n\n'''Erik Gustavovich Laxmann''' ({{lang-ru|\u042d\u0440\u0438\u043a (\u041a\u0438\u0440\u0438\u043b\u043b) \u0413\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041b\u0430\u043a\u0441\u043c\u0430\u043d}}) (July 27, 1737 \u2013 January 6, 1796) was a [[Swedish-speaking Finns|Finnish-Swedish]] clergyman, explorer and natural scientist born in [[Nyslott]] in [[Finland]], then part of [[Sweden]]. He is remembered today for his taxonomic work on the fauna of Siberia and for his attempts to establish relations between [[Imperial Russia]] and [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa Japan]].\n\nIn 1757, Laxmann started his studies at the [[Academy of \u00c5bo]] and was subsequently ordained a Lutheran priest in [[St. Petersburg]], the capital of Russia. In 1764, he was appointed as a preacher in a small parish in [[Barnaul]] in central [[Siberia]], whence he undertook a number of exploratory journeys, reaching [[Irkutsk]], [[Lake Baikal|Baikal]], [[Kiakhta]] and the border to [[China]]. His collection of material on the fauna of Siberia made him famous in scientific circles and in 1770, he was appointed professor of chemistry and economy at the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]. In 1769, Laxmann was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].\n\n== Irkutsk ==\nIn 1780, Laxmann settled in Irkutsk, where he would spend much of the rest of his life.<ref>[http://runeberg.org/nfbo/0760.html Biographical entry in Nordisk familjebok (in Swedish)]</ref>  In 1782, Laxmann founded a museum in Irkutsk, which is the oldest in Siberia.<ref>[http://museum.irkutsk.ru/eng/about/ The irkutsk's museum of regional studies<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211174447/http://museum.irkutsk.ru/eng/about/ |date=2007-02-11 }}</ref>\nLaxmann also ran a glass factory in a suburb of [[Irkutsk]], around 6 [[verst]]s (24 kilometers) away from the center of the city with a famous merchant [[Alexander Andreyevich Baranov]] as a business partner;<ref>[http://baikal.travel/lake_baikal/openair_museum_of_Taltsy/ Openair Museum of Taltsy]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} viewed 2009-05-13</ref> the factory was roughly 36 metres (20 ''[[Ken (unit)|ken]]'') square. Products were not only sold domestically, but also to northeastern China.\n\nAlthough he had many connections to local people of importance, Laxmann developed an antagonistic relationship with [[Grigory Shelikhov]], a seafarer and merchant. Laxmann noticed that Shelikhov, along with the Irkutsk Governor-General's Office had tried to pressure [[Daikokuya K\u014dday\u016b]], a Japanese castaway, into staying in Russia and serving as a translator for the merchant. The fact that Shelikhov also had strong connections with some Russian bureaucrats made the situation more complex. After Laxmann went to St.Petersburg on Kodayu's behalf, he began to send letters directly to Grand Chancellor [[Alexander Bezborodko]] (due to the Chancellor's high position, the use of intermediaries was normally required).\n\n== Japan ==\n\n===Carl Peter Thunberg===\nLaxmann already had some knowledge about Japan before he met Japanese castaways, reading books written by [[Carl Peter Thunberg]], with whom Laxmann had some communication.\n\n===Daikokuya Kodayu===\nIn 1789, while doing research in Irkutsk, Laxmann came across six Japanese who had been found in [[Amchitka]], one of the [[Aleutian Islands]], by Russian furriers whose leader was a person called Nivizimov. Laxmann escorted the castaways to St. Petersburg, where [[Daikokuya K\u014dday\u016b]], their nominal leader, pleaded with Empress [[Catherine the Great]] to be allowed to return to Japan. During this stay in the capital, Laxmann began discussions on various matters with Alexander Bezborodko, but succumbed to a bout of [[typhoid fever]] which left him incapacitated for three months.\n\nLaxmann recovered consciousness in early May when Catherine had just moved to [[Tsarskoye Selo]] for the summer. Laxmann sent Kodayu to Tsarskoye Selo ahead of him, and Kodayu was able to meet with the Empress several times over six months, as a result of Laxman's dedicated efforts among the Russian bureaucracy, especially with Alexander Bezborodko and chancellor [[Alexander Vorontsov]]. At each presentation at Tsarskoye Selo, Laxmann walked along with Kodayu in order to assist him in the proper etiquette required in the Empress' presence.\n\nIn 1791, Catherine agreed to a plan conceived by Laxman, under which Laxman's son, Lt. [[Adam Laxman]] would command a voyage to Japan, where he would exchange the castaways for economic agreements and concessions. Grigory Shelikhov had proposed another plan that would make the Japanese castaways Russian citizens so that they would be Japanese teachers and translators, but Catherine chose Laxmann and Bezborodko's plan. The elder Laxmann remained in Russia while his son traveled with the castaways.\n\n===Letters to Japanese scholars===\nLaxmann wrote letters to two Japanese scholars, [[Nakagawa Junan]] and [[Katsuragawa Hosh\u016b]], at the recommendation of Carl Peter Thunberg, their teacher. There is no record that the letters ever reached the scholars, even though Adam Laxmann handed the letters to Ishikawa Tadafusa, a staff member of Tokugawa Shogunate, in [[Matsumae, Hokkaid\u014d]]. Erik Laxmann had showed Kodayu the letters before Kodayu left [[Okhotsk]].\nKatsuragawa Hoshu had lots of communication with Kodayu after Kodayu lived in [[Yedo]] so Hoshu edited some books on Russia and Kodayu's experience. It would be possible to think that Hoshu may have known that Laxmann had sent him a letter.\n\n== His family ==\nLaxmann had a wife, Yekaterina Ivanovna, five sons, Gustav, [[Adam Laxman|Adam]], one who died young, Afernaci and Martin and a daughter Mariya. He also lived with his younger brother, his wife and their two daughters, Anna and Elizabeta. Laxmann also had another younger brother, who lived in St. Petersburg.\n{{botanist|Laxm.|Laxmann, Erich}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Dembei]]\n*[[Matsumae clan]]\n\n==References==\n{{Owl}}\n*[[Walter Allen McDougall|McDougall, Walter]] (1993).

[[Symeon of Durham]] records the victory of [[Offa]] in 771 over the ''Hestingorum gens'', that is, \"the people of the Hastings tribe.\" [[Hastingleigh]] in Kent was named after that tribe.

However, the absence of any archaeological remains of or documentary evidence for a Roman fort at Hastings suggest that ''H\u00e6stingaceaster'' may refer to a different settlement, most likely that based on the Roman remains at [[Pevensey]].<ref>Pamela Combes and Malcolm Lyne, \"Hastings, Haestingaceaster and Haestingaport: a question of identity,\" ''Sussex Archaeological Collections'', 133 (1995), 213\u201324. {{ISSN|0143-8204}}</ref>\n\nEvidence of prehistoric settlements have been found at the town site: flint arrowheads and [[Bronze Age]] artefacts have been found. [[Iron Age]] forts have been excavated on both the East and West Hills. This suggests that the inhabitants moved early to the safety of the valley in between the forts. The settlement was already based on the port when the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] arrived in Britain for the first time in 55&nbsp;BC. At this time, they began to [[Iron industry of Ashdown Forest|exploit the iron]] (Wealden rocks provide a plentiful supply of the ore), and shipped it out by boat. Iron was worked locally at [[Beauport Park]], to the north of the town. It employed up to one thousand men and is considered to have been the third-largest mine in the [[Roman Empire]].<ref name=\"OpenLearn\">{{cite web|url=http://www.open.edu/openlearn/history-the-arts/history/beauport-park-east-sussex|title=Beauport Park, East Sussex|date=22 June 2006|work=[[OpenLearn]]|publisher=[[Open University]]|accessdate=10 August 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006145624/http://www.open.edu/openlearn/history-the-arts/history/beauport-park-east-sussex|archivedate=6 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> There was also a possible iron-working site near Blacklands Church in the town - the old name of 'Ponbay Bridge' for a bridge that used to exist in the area is a corruption of 'Pond Bay' as suggested by Thomas Ross (Mayor of Hastings and author of an 1835 guide book)<ref name=\"historymap.info\">Historical Hastings Wiki: [http://wiki.historymap.info/Iron_Working Iron Working - Historical Hastings Wiki], accessdate: 10 December 2019</ref>\n\nWith the departure of the Romans, the town suffered setbacks. The Beauport site was abandoned, and the town suffered from problems from nature and man-made attacks. The Sussex coast has always suffered from occasional violent storms; with the additional hazard of [[longshore drift]] (the eastward movement of shingle along the coast), the coastline has been frequently changing.

It is thought that the Norman encampment was on the town's outskirts, where there was open ground; a new town was already being built in the valley to the east. That \"New Burgh\" was founded in 1069 and is mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]] as such. [[William the Conqueror|William]] defeated and killed [[Harold Godwinson]], the last Saxon King of England, and destroyed his army, thus opening England to the Norman conquest.\n\nWilliam caused a castle to be built at Hastings probably using the earthworks of the existing Saxon castle.\n\nHastings was shown as a [[borough]] by the time of the [[Domesday Book]] (1086); it had also given its name to the [[Rape of Hastings]], one of the six administrative divisions of Sussex. As a borough, Hastings had a [[corporation]] consisting of a \"bailiff, jurats, and commonalty\". By a Charter of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] in 1589, the bailiff was replaced by a mayor.\n\nMuslim scholar [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]], writing c.1153, described Hastings as \"a town of large extent and many inhabitants, flourishing and handsome, having markets, workpeople and rich merchants\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cartographyunchained.com/pdfs/cgid1_pdf.pdf |title=Al-Idrisi; The Book of Roger The description of L'Angleterre |accessdate=2016-12-19 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922081246/http://www.cartographyunchained.com/pdfs/cgid1_pdf.pdf |archivedate=22 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Hastings and the sea===\n[[File:Joseph Mallord William Turner - The Fish Market at Hastings Beach - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''The Fish Market at Hastings Beach'', [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]] (1810)]]\n\nBy the end of the Saxon period, the port of Hastings had moved eastward near the present town centre in the Priory Stream valley, whose entrance was protected by the White Rock headland (since demolished). It was to be a short stay: Danish attacks and huge floods in 1011 and 1014 motivated the townspeople to relocate to the New Burgh.\n\nIn the Middle Ages Hastings became one of the [[Cinque Ports]]; [[Sandwich, Kent|Sandwich]], [[Dover]] and [[New Romney]] being the first, Hastings and [[Hythe, Kent|Hythe]] followed, all finally being joined by [[Rye, East Sussex|Rye]] and [[Winchelsea]], at one point 42 towns were directly or indirectly affiliated with the group.\n\n[[File:Hastings Castle 2012-07-28.jpg|thumb|[[Hastings Castle]], with the Pier and Town Centre in the background, and [[Eastbourne]] on the horizon]]\n\nIn the 13th century, much of the town and half of [[Hastings Castle]] was washed away in the [[South England flood of February 1287]]. During a [[English Channel naval campaign, 1338-1339|naval campaign of 1339]], and again in 1377, the town was raided and burnt by the French, and seems then to have gone into a decline. As a port, Hastings' days were finished.\n\n[[File:Hastings town centre postcard.jpg|thumb|left|Hastings town centre and the Memorial from an old postcard]]\nHastings had suffered over the years from the lack of a natural harbour, and there have been attempts to create a sheltered harbour. Attempts were made to build a stone harbour during the reign of [[Elizabeth I]], but the foundations were destroyed by the sea in terrible storms. The fishing boats are still stored on and launched from the beach.\n\nHastings was then just a small fishing settlement, but it was soon discovered that the new taxes on luxury goods could be made profitable by smuggling; the town was ideally located for that purpose.<ref name=\"Smuggling on the Sussex Coast\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hmag.org.uk/LocalHistory/ |title=Hastings Museum |publisher=Smuggling on the Sussex Coast |accessdate=10 February 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318003820/http://www.hmag.org.uk/LocalHistory/ |archivedate=18 March 2009 }}</ref> Near the castle ruins, on the West Hill, are \"[[St Clement's Caves]]\", partly natural, but mainly excavated by hand by smugglers from the soft sandstone. Their trade was to come to an end with the period following the [[Napoleonic Wars]], for the town became one of the most fashionable resorts in Britain, brought about by the so-called health-giving properties of seawater, as well as the local springs and Roman baths. Once this came about the expansion of the town took place, to the west, since there was little space left in the valley.\n\n[[File:Bottle Alley Hastings.jpg|thumb|right|The double decker promenade that runs from Hastings Pier beyond Marine Court (seen in the distance), with a break at Warrior Square, was built in the 1930s by the borough engineer [[Sidney Little]]]]\nIt was at this time that the elegant Pelham Crescent and Wellington Square were built: other building followed. In the Crescent (designed by architect [[Joseph Kay (architect)|Joseph Kay]]) is the classical style church of St Mary in the Castle (its name recalling the old chapel in the castle above) now in use as an arts centre. The building of the crescent and the church necessitated further cutting away of the castle hill cliffs. Once that move away from the old town had begun, it led to the further expansion along the coast, eventually linking up with the new [[St Leonards-on-Sea|St Leonards]].\n\nThe extensive development meant that a large transient work-force was required. Many of the people coming in to Hastings at this time, settled on some waste-ground to the west of the main town called the [[America Ground]]. This land, originally a shingle spit created by the great storm of 1287, was declared to be Crown Property after an inquiry held at [[Battle]] during 1827 and the land was cleared in preparation for the development of this area of land by [[Patrick Francis Robertson]].<ref>[http://wiki.historymap.info/Category:America_Ground Hastings local history Wiki]</ref>\n\n{{main|Hastings Old Town}}\n\n[[File:Historische Altstadt-Hastings.JPG|thumb|left|George Street, Old town]]\nLike many coastal towns, the population of Hastings grew significantly as a result of the construction of railway links and the fashionable growth of seaside holidays during the [[Victorian era]]. In 1801, its population was a mere 3,175; by 1831, it had reached over ten thousand; by 1891, it was almost sixty thousand.\n\nThe last harbour project began in 1896, but this also failed when structural problems and rising costs exhausted all the available funds. Today a fractured seawall is all that remains of what might have become a magnificent harbour. In 1897, the foundation stone was laid on a large concrete structure, but there was insufficient money to complete the work and the \"Harbour arm\" remains uncompleted. It was later partially blown up to discourage possible use by German invasion forces during World War II.\n\nBetween 1903 and 1919 Fred Judge FRPS photographed many of the towns events and disasters.  These included storms, the first tram, visit of the Lord Mayor of London, Hastings Marathon Race and the pier fire of 1917. Many of these images were produced as picture postcards by the British Postcard manufacturer he founded now known as [[Judges Postcards]].\n\nIn the 1930s, the town underwent some rejuvenation. Seaside resorts were starting to go out of fashion: Hastings perhaps more than most. The town council set about a huge rebuilding project, among which the promenade was rebuilt, and an Olympic-size bathing pool was erected. The latter, regarded in its day as one of the best open-air swimming and diving complexes in Europe, later became a holiday camp before closing in 1986. It was demolished, but the area is still known by locals as \"The Old Bathing Pool\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seasidehistory.co.uk/hastings_lido.html|title=The Bathing Pool at Hastings and St Leonards|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517053426/http://seasidehistory.co.uk/hastings_lido.html|archivedate=17 May 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n[[File:Hastings Old Town July 1965.jpg|thumb|Hastings Old Town July 1965.]]\nThe 2001 census reported over 85,000 inhabitants.\n\n==Governance==\n[[File:EastSussexHastings.png|thumb|right|Borough of Hastings, shown within East Sussex]]\n\n{{details|Hastings and Rye (UK Parliament constituency)}}\nHastings returned two [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] from the 14th century until 1885, since when it has returned one.

Prior to 1983, the town formed  the [[Hastings (UK Parliament constituency)|Hastings parliamentary constituency]] by itself.\n\nHastings, it is thought, was a Saxon town before the arrival of the Normans: the [[Domesday Book]] refers to a ''new Borough'': as a borough, Hastings had a [[corporation]] consisting of a \"bailiff, jurats, and commonalty\".<ref name=\"Hastings Past\"/> Its importance was such that it also gave its name to one of the six [[Rape (county subdivision)|Rapes]] or administrative districts of Sussex.\n\n[[File:Hastings Town Hall - geograph.org.uk - 1197481.jpg|thumb|left|Hastings Town Hall]]\nBy a Charter of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] in 1589 the bailiff was replaced by a mayor, by which time the town's importance was dwindling. In the [[Georgian era]], patronage of such seaside places (such as nearby [[Brighton]]) gave it a new lease of life so that, when the time came with the reform of English local government in 1888, Hastings became a [[County Borough]], responsible for all its local services, independent of the surrounding county, then Sussex (East); less than one hundred years later, [[Local Government Act 1972|in 1974]], that status was abolished.\n\nHastings Borough Council is now in the second tier of local government, below [[East Sussex County Council]].

[[Hastings Old Town]] is in a sheltered valley between the East Hill and West Hill (on which the remains of the Castle stand). In Victorian times and later the town has spread westwards and northwards, and now forms a single urban centre with the more suburban area of [[St Leonards-on-Sea]] to the west. Roads from the Old Town valley lead towards the Victorian area of Clive Vale and the former village of [[Ore, Sussex|Ore]], from which \"The Ridge\", marking the effective boundary of Hastings, extends north-westwards towards [[Battle, East Sussex|Battle]]. Beyond [[Bulverhythe]], the western end of Hastings is marked by low-lying land known as [[Glyne Gap]], separating it from [[Bexhill-on-Sea]].\n\nThe sandstone cliffs have been the subject of considerable erosion in relatively recent times: much of the Castle was lost to the sea before the present sea defences and promenade were built, and a number of cliff-top houses are in danger of disappearing around the nearby village of [[Fairlight, East Sussex|Fairlight]].\n\nThe beach is mainly shingle, although wide areas of sand are uncovered at low tide.

areas===\nSome of the areas and suburbs of Hastings are [[Ore Valley]], [[St Leonards on Sea|St Leonards]], [[Silverhill, East Sussex|Silverhill]], [[Bulverhythe|West St Leonards]], and [[Hollington, East Sussex|Hollington]]. Ore, Silverhill and Hollington were once villages that have since become part of the Hastings conurbation area during rapid growth.<ref name=\"Wards\"/> The original part St Leonards was bought by [[James Burton (property developer)|James Burton]] and laid out by his son, the architect [[Decimus Burton]], in the early 19th century as a new town: a place of elegant houses designed for the well-off; it also included a central public garden, a hotel, an archery, [[assembly rooms]] and [[St Leonard's Church, St Leonards-on-Sea|a church]]. Today's St Leonards has extended well beyond that original design, although the original town still exists within it.<ref name=\"1066stl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.1066online.co.uk/hastings-history/burtons-st-leonards/burton-st-leonards-history.htm|title=Burton's St Leonards|publisher=1066online|accessdate=29 June 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101223206/http://www.1066online.co.uk/hastings-history/burtons-st-leonards/burton-st-leonards-history.htm|archivedate=1 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Demography==\nThe population of the town in 2001 was 85,029, by 2009 the estimated population was 86,900. Hastings suffers at a disadvantage insofar as growth is concerned because of its restricted situation, lying as it does with the [[High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] to the north. Redevelopment of the area is partly hampered by the split administration of the combined Hastings and Bexhill economic region between Hastings and [[Rother District|Rother]] district councils. There is little space for further large-scale housing and employment growth within the designated boundaries of Hastings, and development on the outskirts is resisted by Rother council whose administrative area surrounds Hastings. Rother has a policy of urban expansion in the area immediately north of Bexhill, but this requires infrastructure improvements by central Governments which have been under discussion for decades.<ref name=\"Local Development Framework\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hastings.gov.uk/ldf/amr.pdf |title=Local Development Framework |publisher=Hastings Online |accessdate=17 February 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060309142442/http://www.hastings.gov.uk/ldf/amr.pdf |archivedate=9 March 2006 }}</ref> This situation has now become the subject of parliamentary consideration.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmselect/cmcomloc/351/35113.htm|title=House of Commons - Communities and Local Government Committee - Second Report|first=The Committee Office, House of|last=Commons|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027065240/http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmselect/cmcomloc/351/35113.htm|archivedate=27 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Ethnicity===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The fishing fleet, based at [[the Stade]], remains Europe's largest beach-launched fishing fleet and has recently won accreditation for its sustainable methods. The fleet has been based on the same beach, below the cliffs at Hastings, for at least 400, possibly 600, years. Its longevity is attributed to the prolific fishing ground of Rye Bay nearby.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Peak |first=Steve  |title=Fishermen of Hastings \u2013 200 years of the Hastings Fishing Community| year=1985}}</ref> Hastings fishing vessels are registered at [[Rye, East Sussex|Rye]], and thus bear the letters \"RX\" ('''R'''ye, Susse'''X''').\n\nThere are now various industrial estates that lie around the town, mostly on the outskirts, which include engineering, catering, motoring and construction; however, most of the jobs within the Borough are concentrated on health, public services, retail and education. 85% of the firms (in 2005) employed fewer than 10 people; as a consequence the unemployment rate was 3.3% (''cf.'' East Sussex 1.7%). However, qualification levels are similar to the national average: 8.2% of the working-age population have no qualifications while 28% hold degree-level qualifications or higher, compared with 11% and 31% respectively across England.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\n===Shopping and retail===\n[[File:Entrance to Kings Walk, Priory Meadow Shopping Centre, Hastings - geograph.org.uk - 1197474.jpg|thumb|left|Entrance to Kings Walk, Priory Meadow Shopping Centre]]\nHastings main shopping centre is [[Priory Meadow Shopping Centre]], which was built on the site of the old [[Central Recreation Ground]] which played host to some [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex CCC]] [[first-class cricket|first-class]] fixtures, and cricketing royalty such as Dr. [[W.

The [[Marshlink Line]] runs via [[Rye, East Sussex|Rye]] to Ashford where a connection can be made with [[Eurostar]] services, and is unelectrified except for the Hastings-Ore segment.\n\nA historic [[British Rail Class 201]] \"Thumper\" can sometimes been seen (and heard) on historic runs to and from Hastings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hastingsdiesels.co.uk/|title=Hastings Diesels Limited \u2013 Home|first=Richard Griffin, for Hastings Diesels|last=Limited|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050819150218/http://www.hastingsdiesels.co.uk/|archivedate=19 August 2005|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nHastings is served by two rail companies: [[Southeastern (train operating company)|Southeastern]] and [[Southern (train operating company)|Southern]].\nSoutheastern services run along the Hastings Line, generally terminating at Hastings, with some peak services extending to Ore; the other lines are served by Southern, with services terminating at Ore or Ashford.\n\nThe town currently has four railway stations: from west to east they are [[West St Leonards station]], [[St Leonards Warrior Square]], [[Hastings railway station|Hastings]], and [[Ore railway station|Ore]]; this latter has been proposed to be renamed to Ore Valley.<ref name=\"Consultation Report\"/> There is also one closed station and one proposed station in the area. [[West Marina Railway Station|West Marina]] station (on the LBSCR line) was very near West St Leonards (on the SER line) and was closed some years ago.

The [[National Cycle Network]] route NCR2 links Dover to [[St Austell]] along the south coast, and passes through Hastings.\n\n===Historical transport systems===\n\n====Turnpike====\nIn 1753 many prominent Hastings figures \u2013 including the major landowners [[Edward Milward]] and [[John Collier (mayor)|John Collier]] \u2013 obtained an Act that allowed them to take control of the existing Hastings-London trackway via Battle and Whatlington, as far north as Flimwell<ref>[http://wiki.historymap.info/Turnpike_Roads Hastings History Wiki: Turnpike Roads]</ref>, however the first properly recognised turnpike developed in St. Leonards in 1837 when builder [[James Burton (property developer)|James Burton]] was building his new town of St Leonards. The route of the road is that taken by the A21 today.\n\n====Trams and trolleybuses====\n[[File:Hastings and District Electric Tramways.jpg|thumb|Map of the Hastings and District Electric Tramways]]\nHastings had a network of [[tram]]s from 1905 to 1929. The trams ran as far as Bexhill, and were worked by overhead electric wires, except for the stretch along the seafront from Bo-Peep to the Memorial, which was initially worked by the Dolter stud contact system. The Dolter system was replaced by petrol electric trams in 1914 due to safety concerns<ref name=\"historymap.info_3\">Historical Hastings Wiki: [http://wiki.historymap.info/Tram#Summary Tram - Historical Hastings Wiki], accessdate: 14 January 2020</ref>, but overhead electrification was extended to this section in 1921. [[Trolleybus]]es rather than trams were used in the section that included the very narrow High Street, and the entire tram network was replaced by the [[Trolleybuses in Hastings|Hastings trolleybus system]] in 1928\u20131929.<ref>Robert J Harley, ''Hastings Tramways''.

There are football clubs in Hastings that compete in the [[East Sussex Football League|East Sussex League]], such as Hollington United, St Leonards Social and Rock-a-Nore, playing at local parks and recreation grounds about the town. United attracted sports media headlines, when in 2013 they made it to the third round of the [[FA Cup]] for the first time in their history, being the lowest ranked team left in the contest before going out - losing 4-1 to Middlesbrough.\n\nThe [[Central Recreation Ground]] was one of England's oldest, most scenic and most famous cricket grounds.

[[Symeon of Durham]] records the victory of [[Offa]] in 771 over the ''Hestingorum gens'', that is, \"the people of the Hastings tribe.\" [[Hastingleigh]] in Kent was named after that tribe.

However, the absence of any archaeological remains of or documentary evidence for a Roman fort at Hastings suggest that ''H\u00e6stingaceaster'' may refer to a different settlement, most likely that based on the Roman remains at [[Pevensey]].<ref>Pamela Combes and Malcolm Lyne, \"Hastings, Haestingaceaster and Haestingaport: a question of identity,\" ''Sussex Archaeological Collections'', 133 (1995), 213\u201324. {{ISSN|0143-8204}}</ref>\n\nEvidence of prehistoric settlements have been found at the town site: flint arrowheads and [[Bronze Age]] artefacts have been found. [[Iron Age]] forts have been excavated on both the East and West Hills. This suggests that the inhabitants moved early to the safety of the valley in between the forts. The settlement was already based on the port when the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] arrived in Britain for the first time in 55&nbsp;BC. At this time, they began to [[Iron industry of Ashdown Forest|exploit the iron]] (Wealden rocks provide a plentiful supply of the ore), and shipped it out by boat. Iron was worked locally at [[Beauport Park]], to the north of the town. It employed up to one thousand men and is considered to have been the third-largest mine in the [[Roman Empire]].<ref name=\"OpenLearn\">{{cite web|url=http://www.open.edu/openlearn/history-the-arts/history/beauport-park-east-sussex|title=Beauport Park, East Sussex|date=22 June 2006|work=[[OpenLearn]]|publisher=[[Open University]]|accessdate=10 August 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006145624/http://www.open.edu/openlearn/history-the-arts/history/beauport-park-east-sussex|archivedate=6 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> There was also a possible iron-working site near Blacklands Church in the town - the old name of 'Ponbay Bridge' for a bridge that used to exist in the area is a corruption of 'Pond Bay' as suggested by Thomas Ross (Mayor of Hastings and author of an 1835 guide book)<ref name=\"historymap.info\">Historical Hastings Wiki: [http://wiki.historymap.info/Iron_Working Iron Working - Historical Hastings Wiki], accessdate: 10 December 2019</ref>\n\nWith the departure of the Romans, the town suffered setbacks. The Beauport site was abandoned, and the town suffered from problems from nature and man-made attacks. The Sussex coast has always suffered from occasional violent storms; with the additional hazard of [[longshore drift]] (the eastward movement of shingle along the coast), the coastline has been frequently changing.

It is thought that the Norman encampment was on the town's outskirts, where there was open ground; a new town was already being built in the valley to the east. That \"New Burgh\" was founded in 1069 and is mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]] as such. [[William the Conqueror|William]] defeated and killed [[Harold Godwinson]], the last Saxon King of England, and destroyed his army, thus opening England to the Norman conquest.\n\nWilliam caused a castle to be built at Hastings probably using the earthworks of the existing Saxon castle.\n\nHastings was shown as a [[borough]] by the time of the [[Domesday Book]] (1086); it had also given its name to the [[Rape of Hastings]], one of the six administrative divisions of Sussex. As a borough, Hastings had a [[corporation]] consisting of a \"bailiff, jurats, and commonalty\". By a Charter of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] in 1589, the bailiff was replaced by a mayor.\n\nMuslim scholar [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]], writing c.1153, described Hastings as \"a town of large extent and many inhabitants, flourishing and handsome, having markets, workpeople and rich merchants\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cartographyunchained.com/pdfs/cgid1_pdf.pdf |title=Al-Idrisi; The Book of Roger The description of L'Angleterre |accessdate=2016-12-19 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922081246/http://www.cartographyunchained.com/pdfs/cgid1_pdf.pdf |archivedate=22 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Hastings and the sea===\n[[File:Joseph Mallord William Turner - The Fish Market at Hastings Beach - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''The Fish Market at Hastings Beach'', [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]] (1810)]]\n\nBy the end of the Saxon period, the port of Hastings had moved eastward near the present town centre in the Priory Stream valley, whose entrance was protected by the White Rock headland (since demolished). It was to be a short stay: Danish attacks and huge floods in 1011 and 1014 motivated the townspeople to relocate to the New Burgh.\n\nIn the Middle Ages Hastings became one of the [[Cinque Ports]]; [[Sandwich, Kent|Sandwich]], [[Dover]] and [[New Romney]] being the first, Hastings and [[Hythe, Kent|Hythe]] followed, all finally being joined by [[Rye, East Sussex|Rye]] and [[Winchelsea]], at one point 42 towns were directly or indirectly affiliated with the group.\n\n[[File:Hastings Castle 2012-07-28.jpg|thumb|[[Hastings Castle]], with the Pier and Town Centre in the background, and [[Eastbourne]] on the horizon]]\n\nIn the 13th century, much of the town and half of [[Hastings Castle]] was washed away in the [[South England flood of February 1287]]. During a [[English Channel naval campaign, 1338-1339|naval campaign of 1339]], and again in 1377, the town was raided and burnt by the French, and seems then to have gone into a decline. As a port, Hastings' days were finished.\n\n[[File:Hastings town centre postcard.jpg|thumb|left|Hastings town centre and the Memorial from an old postcard]]\nHastings had suffered over the years from the lack of a natural harbour, and there have been attempts to create a sheltered harbour. Attempts were made to build a stone harbour during the reign of [[Elizabeth I]], but the foundations were destroyed by the sea in terrible storms. The fishing boats are still stored on and launched from the beach.\n\nHastings was then just a small fishing settlement, but it was soon discovered that the new taxes on luxury goods could be made profitable by smuggling; the town was ideally located for that purpose.<ref name=\"Smuggling on the Sussex Coast\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hmag.org.uk/LocalHistory/ |title=Hastings Museum |publisher=Smuggling on the Sussex Coast |accessdate=10 February 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318003820/http://www.hmag.org.uk/LocalHistory/ |archivedate=18 March 2009 }}</ref> Near the castle ruins, on the West Hill, are \"[[St Clement's Caves]]\", partly natural, but mainly excavated by hand by smugglers from the soft sandstone. Their trade was to come to an end with the period following the [[Napoleonic Wars]], for the town became one of the most fashionable resorts in Britain, brought about by the so-called health-giving properties of seawater, as well as the local springs and Roman baths. Once this came about the expansion of the town took place, to the west, since there was little space left in the valley.\n\n[[File:Bottle Alley Hastings.jpg|thumb|right|The double decker promenade that runs from Hastings Pier beyond Marine Court (seen in the distance), with a break at Warrior Square, was built in the 1930s by the borough engineer [[Sidney Little]]]]\nIt was at this time that the elegant Pelham Crescent and Wellington Square were built: other building followed. In the Crescent (designed by architect [[Joseph Kay (architect)|Joseph Kay]]) is the classical style church of St Mary in the Castle (its name recalling the old chapel in the castle above) now in use as an arts centre. The building of the crescent and the church necessitated further cutting away of the castle hill cliffs. Once that move away from the old town had begun, it led to the further expansion along the coast, eventually linking up with the new [[St Leonards-on-Sea|St Leonards]].\n\nThe extensive development meant that a large transient work-force was required. Many of the people coming in to Hastings at this time, settled on some waste-ground to the west of the main town called the [[America Ground]]. This land, originally a shingle spit created by the great storm of 1287, was declared to be Crown Property after an inquiry held at [[Battle]] during 1827 and the land was cleared in preparation for the development of this area of land by [[Patrick Francis Robertson]].<ref>[http://wiki.historymap.info/Category:America_Ground Hastings local history Wiki]</ref>\n\n{{main|Hastings Old Town}}\n\n[[File:Historische Altstadt-Hastings.JPG|thumb|left|George Street, Old town]]\nLike many coastal towns, the population of Hastings grew significantly as a result of the construction of railway links and the fashionable growth of seaside holidays during the [[Victorian era]]. In 1801, its population was a mere 3,175; by 1831, it had reached over ten thousand; by 1891, it was almost sixty thousand.\n\nThe last harbour project began in 1896, but this also failed when structural problems and rising costs exhausted all the available funds. Today a fractured seawall is all that remains of what might have become a magnificent harbour. In 1897, the foundation stone was laid on a large concrete structure, but there was insufficient money to complete the work and the \"Harbour arm\" remains uncompleted. It was later partially blown up to discourage possible use by German invasion forces during World War II.\n\nBetween 1903 and 1919 Fred Judge FRPS photographed many of the towns events and disasters.  These included storms, the first tram, visit of the Lord Mayor of London, Hastings Marathon Race and the pier fire of 1917. Many of these images were produced as picture postcards by the British Postcard manufacturer he founded now known as [[Judges Postcards]].\n\nIn the 1930s, the town underwent some rejuvenation. Seaside resorts were starting to go out of fashion: Hastings perhaps more than most. The town council set about a huge rebuilding project, among which the promenade was rebuilt, and an Olympic-size bathing pool was erected. The latter, regarded in its day as one of the best open-air swimming and diving complexes in Europe, later became a holiday camp before closing in 1986. It was demolished, but the area is still known by locals as \"The Old Bathing Pool\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seasidehistory.co.uk/hastings_lido.html|title=The Bahting Pool at Hastings and St Leonards|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517053426/http://seasidehistory.co.uk/hastings_lido.html|archivedate=17 May 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n[[File:Hastings Old Town July 1965.jpg|thumb|Hastings Old Town July 1965.]]\nThe 2001 census reported over 85,000 inhabitants.\n\n==Governance==\n[[File:EastSussexHastings.png|thumb|right|Borough of Hastings, shown within East Sussex]]\n\n{{details|Hastings and Rye (UK Parliament constituency)}}\nHastings returned two [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] from the 14th century until 1885, since when it has returned one.

Prior to 1983, the town formed  the [[Hastings (UK Parliament constituency)|Hastings parliamentary constituency]] by itself.\n\nHastings, it is thought, was a Saxon town before the arrival of the Normans: the [[Domesday Book]] refers to a ''new Borough'': as a borough, Hastings had a [[corporation]] consisting of a \"bailiff, jurats, and commonalty\".<ref name=\"Hastings Past\"/> Its importance was such that it also gave its name to one of the six [[Rape (county subdivision)|Rapes]] or administrative districts of Sussex.\n\n[[File:Hastings Town Hall - geograph.org.uk - 1197481.jpg|thumb|left|Hastings Town Hall]]\nBy a Charter of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] in 1589 the bailiff was replaced by a mayor, by which time the town's importance was dwindling. In the [[Georgian era]], patronage of such seaside places (such as nearby [[Brighton]]) gave it a new lease of life so that, when the time came with the reform of English local government in 1888, Hastings became a [[County Borough]], responsible for all its local services, independent of the surrounding county, then Sussex (East); less than one hundred years later, [[Local Government Act 1972|in 1974]], that status was abolished.\n\nHastings Borough Council is now in the second tier of local government, below [[East Sussex County Council]].

[[Hastings Old Town]] is in a sheltered valley between the East Hill and West Hill (on which the remains of the Castle stand). In Victorian times and later the town has spread westwards and northwards, and now forms a single urban centre with the more suburban area of [[St Leonards-on-Sea]] to the west. Roads from the Old Town valley lead towards the Victorian area of Clive Vale and the former village of [[Ore, Sussex|Ore]], from which \"The Ridge\", marking the effective boundary of Hastings, extends north-westwards towards [[Battle, East Sussex|Battle]]. Beyond [[Bulverhythe]], the western end of Hastings is marked by low-lying land known as [[Glyne Gap]], separating it from [[Bexhill-on-Sea]].\n\nThe sandstone cliffs have been the subject of considerable erosion in relatively recent times: much of the Castle was lost to the sea before the present sea defences and promenade were built, and a number of cliff-top houses are in danger of disappearing around the nearby village of [[Fairlight, East Sussex|Fairlight]].\n\nThe beach is mainly shingle, although wide areas of sand are uncovered at low tide.

areas===\nSome of the areas and suburbs of Hastings are [[Ore Valley]], [[St Leonards on Sea|St Leonards]], [[Silverhill, East Sussex|Silverhill]], [[Bulverhythe|West St Leonards]], and [[Hollington, East Sussex|Hollington]]. Ore, Silverhill and Hollington were once villages that have since become part of the Hastings conurbation area during rapid growth.<ref name=\"Wards\"/> The original part St Leonards was bought by [[James Burton (property developer)|James Burton]] and laid out by his son, the architect [[Decimus Burton]], in the early 19th century as a new town: a place of elegant houses designed for the well-off; it also included a central public garden, a hotel, an archery, [[assembly rooms]] and [[St Leonard's Church, St Leonards-on-Sea|a church]]. Today's St Leonards has extended well beyond that original design, although the original town still exists within it.<ref name=\"1066stl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.1066online.co.uk/hastings-history/burtons-st-leonards/burton-st-leonards-history.htm|title=Burton's St Leonards|publisher=1066online|accessdate=29 June 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101223206/http://www.1066online.co.uk/hastings-history/burtons-st-leonards/burton-st-leonards-history.htm|archivedate=1 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Demography==\nThe population of the town in 2001 was 85,029, by 2009 the estimated population was 86,900. Hastings suffers at a disadvantage insofar as growth is concerned because of its restricted situation, lying as it does with the [[High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] to the north. Redevelopment of the area is partly hampered by the split administration of the combined Hastings and Bexhill economic region between Hastings and [[Rother District|Rother]] district councils. There is little space for further large-scale housing and employment growth within the designated boundaries of Hastings, and development on the outskirts is resisted by Rother council whose administrative area surrounds Hastings. Rother has a policy of urban expansion in the area immediately north of Bexhill, but this requires infrastructure improvements by central Governments which have been under discussion for decades.<ref name=\"Local Development Framework\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hastings.gov.uk/ldf/amr.pdf |title=Local Development Framework |publisher=Hastings Online |accessdate=17 February 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060309142442/http://www.hastings.gov.uk/ldf/amr.pdf |archivedate=9 March 2006 }}</ref> This situation has now become the subject of parliamentary consideration.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmselect/cmcomloc/351/35113.htm|title=House of Commons - Communities and Local Government Committee - Second Report|first=The Committee Office, House of|last=Commons|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027065240/http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmselect/cmcomloc/351/35113.htm|archivedate=27 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Ethnicity===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The fishing fleet, based at [[the Stade]], remains Europe's largest beach-launched fishing fleet and has recently won accreditation for its sustainable methods. The fleet has been based on the same beach, below the cliffs at Hastings, for at least 400, possibly 600, years. Its longevity is attributed to the prolific fishing ground of Rye Bay nearby.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Peak |first=Steve  |title=Fishermen of Hastings \u2013 200 years of the Hastings Fishing Community| year=1985}}</ref> Hastings fishing vessels are registered at [[Rye, East Sussex|Rye]], and thus bear the letters \"RX\" ('''R'''ye, Susse'''X''').\n\nThere are now various industrial estates that lie around the town, mostly on the outskirts, which include engineering, catering, motoring and construction; however, most of the jobs within the Borough are concentrated on health, public services, retail and education. 85% of the firms (in 2005) employed fewer than 10 people; as a consequence the unemployment rate was 3.3% (''cf.'' East Sussex 1.7%). However, qualification levels are similar to the national average: 8.2% of the working-age population have no qualifications while 28% hold degree-level qualifications or higher, compared with 11% and 31% respectively across England.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\n===Shopping and retail===\n[[File:Entrance to Kings Walk, Priory Meadow Shopping Centre, Hastings - geograph.org.uk - 1197474.jpg|thumb|left|Entrance to Kings Walk, Priory Meadow Shopping Centre]]\nHastings main shopping centre is [[Priory Meadow Shopping Centre]], which was built on the site of the old [[Central Recreation Ground]] which played host to some [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex CCC]] [[first-class cricket|first-class]] fixtures, and cricketing royalty such as Dr. [[W.

Both are beset with traffic problems: although the London road, which has to contend with difficult terrain, has had several sections of widening over the past decades there are still many delays. Long-term plans for a much improved A259 east\u2013west route (including a Hastings bypass) were abandoned in the 1990s. A new Hastings-Bexhill Link Road opened in April 2016 known as the [[A2690]] with the hope of reducing traffic congestion along the A259 Bexhill Road. The new link road travels from Queensway in the North of Hastings and joins up to the A259 in Bexhill.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eastsussex.gov.uk/roadsandtransport/bexhillhastingslinkroad/|title=Bexhill to Hastings link road \u2013 East Sussex County Council|first=Web Team, East Sussex County Council, County Hall, Lewes, BN7 1UE.|last=https://www.eastsussex.gov.uk/contact-us/|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513013102/http://www.eastsussex.gov.uk/roadsandtransport/bexhillhastingslinkroad/|archivedate=13 May 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Hastings is also linked to [[Battle, East Sussex|Battle]] via the [[A2100 road|A2100]], the original London road.\n\nThe town is served by [[Stagecoach in Hastings]] buses on routes that serve the town, and also extend to Bexhill, Eastbourne and Dover as part of [[Stagecoach The Wave routes|The Wave route]].
