It comprises [[Monterey County, California|Monterey]], [[San Benito County, California|San Benito]], [[San Luis Obispo County, California|San Luis Obispo]], and [[Santa Cruz County, California|Santa Cruz]] counties.\n\nThe diocese is led by an [[Ordinary (Catholic Church)|ordinary]] [[bishop]]; the bishop's [[cathedra]] is located at the [[Cathedral of San Carlos Borromeo]], the [[mother church]] of the diocese, in [[Monterey, California]]. The diocese serves close to 200,000 Catholics in 46 parishes and 18 schools.\n\n==History==\nThe history of the Catholic Church in Monterey began with the establishment on the shores of [[Monterey Bay]] of [[Mission San Carlos Borromeo]] in 1770 by Saint [[Jun\u00edpero Serra]], [[Order of Friars Minor|OFM]]. Father Serra moved the mission to [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California|Carmel]] the next year, which served as the headquarters of the chain of [[Spanish missions in California]].\n\nWith the [[papal bull]] ''Apostolicam sollicitudinem'' of 27 April 1840, Pope [[Gregory XVI]] set up a new [[episcopal see]], to which he gave the name of '''[[California (titular see)|Diocese of California]]'''. He assigned to it a vast territory taken from that of the [[Diocese of Sonora]], now the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Hermosillo|Archdiocese of Hermosillo]] in Mexico. It included [[Alta California]] (corresponding to the present-day states of [[California]], [[Nevada]], [[Arizona]], [[Utah]], western [[Colorado]] and southwestern [[Wyoming]]) and the [[Baja California Territory]] (the modern Mexican states of [[Baja California (state)|Baja California]] and [[Baja California Sur]]). He set the episcopal residence at [[San Diego]] and made the diocese a [[suffragan]] of the [[Archdiocese of Mexico City]].<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/iurispontificii01martgoog#page/n6/mode/1up The Papal Bull ''Apostolicam sollicitudinem''], in Raffaele de Martinis, ''Iuris pontificii de propaganda fide. Pars prima'', Tomus V, Romae 1890, pp. 233\u2013235]</ref>\n\nThe first bishop of the diocese was [[Francisco Garcia Diego y Moreno]], [[Order of Friars Minor|OFM]]. [[Mission Santa Barbara]] served as the [[pro-cathedral]].\n\nIn 1848 Alta California was ceded to the [[United States]] after the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], and the government of [[Mexico]] objected to a United States-based bishop having jurisdiction over parishes in Mexican Baja California. The [[Holy See]] divided the diocese into American and Mexican sections and, on 20 November 1849, with the episcopal residence moved to Monterey, a more central position for the new diocese, the American section became the Diocese of Monterey. The [[Royal Presidio Chapel]] in Monterey served as the pro-cathedral of the American diocese. In 1853 the diocese was split again, when [[Pope Pius IX]] created the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Francisco|Archdiocese of San Francisco]], and Monterey was transferred to be a suffragan of the new [[archdiocese]].\n\nIn 1859, the diocese's name was changed to the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Monterey-Los Angeles|Diocese of Monterey-Los Angeles]], due to the growth of the [[Los Angeles, California|City of Los Angeles]]. The diocese was split in 1922 to form the Dioceses of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Monterey-Fresno|Monterey-Fresno]] and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Los Angeles-San Diego|Los Angeles-San Diego]]. In 1936 the diocese again changed [[metropolitan bishop]]s, becoming a suffragan of the newly erected [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles|Archdiocese of Los Angeles]]. The latest territorial change for the diocese came in 1967, when it was split again, to form the present dioceses of Monterey and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Fresno|Fresno]]. The diocese remains as a suffragen diocese of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles.\n\n==Bishops==\nThe lists of Bishops and their years of service:\n\n===Bishop of the Two Californias===\n#[[Francisco Garcia Diego y Moreno]], [[Order of Friars Minor|OFM]] (1840\u20131846)\n(Father [[Jos\u00e9 Maria Gonz\u00e1lez R\u00fabio]], O.F.M. was administrator, 1846-1849.)\n\n===Bishop of Monterey===\n# [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany]], [[Dominican Order|OP]] (1850\u20131853), appointed [[Archbishop of San Francisco]]\n# [[Thaddeus Amat y Brusi]], [[Congregation of the Mission|CM]] (1853\u20131859)\n\n===Bishop of Monterey-Los Angeles===\n# Thaddeus Amat y Brusi,  CM (1859\u20131878)\n# [[Francisco Mora y Borrell]] (1878\u20131896), created [[Archbishop]] (ad personam) upon retirement in 1896\n# [[George Thomas Montgomery]] (1896\u20131902), appointed [[Archdiocese of San Francisco|Coadjutor Archbishop of San Francisco]]\n# [[Thomas James Conaty]] (1903\u20131915)\n# [[John Joseph Cantwell]] (1917\u20131922), appointed [[Archbishop of Los Angeles]]\n([[Peter Muldoon|Peter J.

It comprises [[Monterey County, California|Monterey]], [[San Benito County, California|San Benito]], [[San Luis Obispo County, California|San Luis Obispo]], and [[Santa Cruz County, California|Santa Cruz]] counties.\n\nThe diocese is led by an [[Ordinary (Catholic Church)|ordinary]] [[bishop]]; the bishop's [[cathedra]] is located at the [[Cathedral of San Carlos Borromeo]], the [[mother church]] of the diocese, in [[Monterey, California]]. The diocese serves close to 200,000 Catholics in 46 parishes and 18 schools.\n\n==History==\nThe history of the Catholic Church in Monterey began with the establishment on the shores of [[Monterey Bay]] of [[Mission San Carlos Borromeo]] in 1770 by Saint [[Jun\u00edpero Serra]], [[Order of Friars Minor|OFM]]. Father Serra moved the mission to [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California|Carmel]] the next year, which served as the headquarters of the chain of [[Spanish missions in California]].\n\nWith the [[papal bull]] ''Apostolicam sollicitudinem'' of 27 April 1840, Pope [[Gregory XVI]] set up a new [[episcopal see]], to which he gave the name of '''[[California (titular see)|Diocese of California]]'''. He assigned to it a vast territory taken from that of the [[Diocese of Sonora]], now the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Hermosillo|Archdiocese of Hermosillo]] in Mexico. It included [[Alta California]] (corresponding to the present-day states of [[California]], [[Nevada]], [[Arizona]], [[Utah]], western [[Colorado]] and southwestern [[Wyoming]]) and the [[Baja California Territory]] (the modern Mexican states of [[Baja California (state)|Baja California]] and [[Baja California Sur]]). He set the episcopal residence at [[San Diego]] and made the diocese a [[suffragan]] of the [[Archdiocese of Mexico City]].<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/iurispontificii01martgoog#page/n6/mode/1up The Papal Bull ''Apostolicam sollicitudinem''], in Raffaele de Martinis, ''Iuris pontificii de propaganda fide. Pars prima'', Tomus V, Romae 1890, pp. 233\u2013235]</ref>\n\nThe first bishop of the diocese was [[Francisco Garcia Diego y Moreno]], [[Order of Friars Minor|OFM]]. [[Mission Santa Barbara]] served as the [[pro-cathedral]].\n\nIn 1848 Alta California was ceded to the [[United States]] after the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], and the government of [[Mexico]] objected to a United States-based bishop having jurisdiction over parishes in Mexican Baja California. The [[Holy See]] divided the diocese into American and Mexican sections and, on 20 November 1849, with the episcopal residence moved to Monterey, a more central position for the new diocese, the American section became the Diocese of Monterey. The [[Royal Presidio Chapel]] in Monterey served as the pro-cathedral of the American diocese. In 1853 the diocese was split again, when [[Pope Pius IX]] created the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Francisco|Archdiocese of San Francisco]], and Monterey was transferred to be a suffragan of the new [[archdiocese]].\n\nIn 1859, the diocese's name was changed to the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Monterey-Los Angeles|Diocese of Monterey-Los Angeles]], due to the growth of the [[Los Angeles, California|City of Los Angeles]]. The diocese was split in 1922 to form the Dioceses of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Monterey-Fresno|Monterey-Fresno]] and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Los Angeles-San Diego|Los Angeles-San Diego]]. In 1936 the diocese again changed [[metropolitan bishop]]s, becoming a suffragan of the newly erected [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles|Archdiocese of Los Angeles]]. The latest territorial change for the diocese came in 1967, when it was split again, to form the present dioceses of Monterey and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Fresno|Fresno]]. The diocese remains as a suffragen diocese of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles.\n\n==Bishops==\nThe lists of Bishops and their years of service:\n\n===Bishop of the Two Californias===\n#[[Francisco Garcia Diego y Moreno]], [[Order of Friars Minor|OFM]] (1840\u20131846)\n(Father [[Jos\u00e9 Maria Gonz\u00e1lez R\u00fabio]], O.F.M. was administrator, 1846-1849.)\n\n===Bishop of Monterey===\n# [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany]], [[Dominican Order|OP]] (1850\u20131853), appointed [[Archbishop of San Francisco]]\n# [[Thaddeus Amat y Brusi]], [[Congregation of the Mission|CM]] (1853\u20131859)\n\n===Bishop of Monterey-Los Angeles===\n# Thaddeus Amat y Brusi,  CM (1859\u20131878)\n# [[Francisco Mora y Borrell]] (1878\u20131896), created [[Archbishop]] (ad personam) upon retirement in 1896\n# [[George Thomas Montgomery]] (1896\u20131902), appointed [[Archdiocese of San Francisco|Coadjutor Archbishop of San Francisco]]\n# [[Thomas James Conaty]] (1903\u20131915)\n# [[John Joseph Cantwell]] (1917\u20131922), appointed [[Archbishop of Los Angeles]]\n([[Peter Muldoon|Peter J.

Afterwards, an upset Kelly walks in and addresses to Lisa and Jessie her concerns about Zack not wanting to go out with her anymore. Jessie tries to calm Kelly's fears by telling her that she'll personally talk to Zack about the matter.\n\nIn Zack's bedroom, he is practicing [[flirting]] with Jennifer while in front of a mirror and wearing a [[Suit|suit]] and [[Necktie|tie]].

Although Jessie notes to Zack about how upset Kelly is going to be, Zack reminds Jessie that she promised not to tell anybody. While back in Miss Simpson's classroom, Zack feigns illness as a means of going back to the nurse's office to see Jennifer. Mr. Belding then walks in to tell Slater to report to his physical. In the nurse's office, Zack tells Jennifer that his head is [[Fever|feeling hot]] despite it feeling cool when Jennifer touches it. Shortly after Jennifer leaves the room to get her [[Medical thermometer|thermometer]] to take Zack's temperature, Slater walks in for his dreaded flu shot. But with the curtain drawn forward, Zack mistakenly believes that Slater is Jennifer. It is there that Zack inadvertently confesses to Slater his true feelings about Jennifer. Slater proceeds to [[blackmail]] Zack into another flu shot so that he won't tell Kelly or anybody else about his feelings for Jennifer.\n\nAt The Max, Zack desperately asks Screech if he knows anybody who could take Kelly's mind off him for a while so that he can pursue<ref>{{cite web |url=https://thoughtcatalog.com/rob-fee/2013/10/the-30-greatest-episodes-of-saved-by-the-bell/|title=The 30 Greatest Episodes Of Saved By The Bell|last=Fee|first=Rob|date=October 28, 2013|website=Thought Catalog|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> Jennifer. Screech then tells Zack about a new kid at school named Melvin Nerdly, who is a substitute on is [[Chess club|chess team]]. Shortly thereafter, Kelly walks in and is told by Zack that they should date other people for the time being. When Jessie, Slater and Lisa see Kelly suddenly leave in a huff, Lisa wonders what is troubling Kelly.

Jennifer tells Jessie that the reason why she's retiring is due to her own failing [[Visual perception|eyesight]] and thus, Jessie doesn't need glasses after-all.\n\nThe next day, Zack enters the nurse's office upon Jennifer's request. When Zack sees Jennifer, she dressed decidedly more provocatively than her usual white nurse uniform: A purple [[T-shirt]], black [[miniskirt|tube miniskirt]], [[pantyhose]], a black [[Western wear|western]] [[Belt (clothing)|waist belt]], [[Shoulder pads (fashion)|shoulder pads]], [[Earring#Hoop earrings|hoop earrings]] and [[Court shoe|black pumps]].

Zack proceeds to panic when Jennifer tells him that her \"husband\" is a [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] with a violent [[Temperament|temper]]. When Zack attempts to leave, Jennifer immediately corners him and tells him about how they should not only run away together, but also get married and have lots of children. Zack then tries to tell Jennifer that he already has a girlfriend in Kelly and that one girl is all that he can handle. Before finally allowing him to leave, Jennifer grabs Zack by the collar and boldly asks him if he wants a girl or a woman<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.instagram.com/p/B-qd-7-jUC3/|title=sbtbanniversary FRIDAY, APRIL 6, 1990|last= |first= |date=April 6, 2020|website=Instagram|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref>.\n\nThat evening, Zack is back at Kelly's front porch, where he finds finds Kelly on a date with Melvin Nerdly.

On the journey out, they swim slowly and dive down to around {{cvt|900|m|ft}}. After they arrive, they change behaviour and do short dives to about {{cvt|300|m|ft}} for up to ten minutes. Another white shark that was tagged off the South African coast swam to the southern coast of Australia and back within the year.

Great whites are so sensitive they can detect variations of half a billionth of a [[volt]]. At close range, this allows the shark to locate even immobile animals by detecting their heartbeat. Most fish have a less-developed but similar sense using their body's [[lateral line]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The physiology of the ampullae of Lorenzini in sharks|url=http://www.bio.davidson.edu/people/midorcas/animalphysiology/websites/2005/DiLuzio/index.htm|work=Biology Dept., Davidson College|publisher=Biology @ Davidson|accessdate=20 August 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124035534/http://www.bio.davidson.edu/people/midorcas/animalphysiology/websites/2005/DiLuzio/index.htm|archivedate=24 November 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[File:White shark1.jpg|thumb|Shark biting into the fish head teaser bait next to a cage in [[False Bay]], South Africa]]\n\nTo more successfully hunt fast and agile prey such as sea lions, the great white has adapted to maintain a body temperature warmer than the surrounding water. One of these adaptations is a \"[[rete mirabile]]\" (Latin for \"wonderful net\"). This close web-like structure of veins and arteries, located along each lateral side of the shark, conserves heat by warming the cooler arterial blood with the venous blood that has been warmed by the working muscles. This keeps certain parts of the body (particularly the stomach) at temperatures up to {{cvt|14|C-change|F-change}} <ref>{{cite web|last=Martin|first=R.

When hunting, great whites tend to separate and resolve conflicts with rituals and displays. White sharks rarely resort to combat although some individuals have been found with bite marks that match those of other white sharks. This suggests that when a great white approaches too closely to another, they react with a warning bite. Another possibility is that white sharks bite to show their dominance.\n\nThe great white shark is one of only a few sharks known to regularly lift its head above the sea surface to gaze at other objects such as prey. This is known as [[Spyhopping|spy-hopping]]. This behaviour has also been seen in at least one group of [[blacktip reef shark]]s, but this might be learned from interaction with humans (it is theorized that the shark may also be able to smell better this way because smell travels through air faster than through water). White sharks are generally very curious animals, display intelligence and may also turn to socializing if the situation demands it. At Seal Island, white sharks have been observed arriving and departing in stable \"clans\" of two to six individuals on a yearly basis. Whether clan members are related is unknown, but they get along peacefully enough. In fact, the social structure of a clan is probably most aptly compared to that of a wolf pack; in that each member has a clearly established rank and each clan has an alpha leader. When members of different clans meet, they establish social rank nonviolently through any of a variety of interactions.<ref name=\"NHmag\">{{cite web|url=http://www.naturalhistorymag.com/picks-from-the-past/201391/sociable-killers|title=Sociable Killers|author1=Martin, R.

However, this has rarely been observed due to whales dying in remote areas. It has been estimated that {{cvt|30|kg}} of whale blubber could feed a {{cvt|4.5|m|ft}} white shark for 1.5 months. Detailed observations were made of four whale carcasses in False Bay between 2000 and 2010. Sharks were drawn to the carcass by chemical and odour detection, spread by strong winds. After initially feeding on the whale caudal peduncle and [[fluke (tail)|fluke]], the sharks would investigate the carcass by slowly swimming around it and mouthing several parts before selecting a blubber-rich area. During feeding bouts of 15\u201320 seconds the sharks removed flesh with lateral headshakes, without the protective ocular rotation they employ when attacking live prey. The sharks were frequently observed regurgitating chunks of blubber and immediately returning to feed, possibly in order to replace low energy yield pieces with high energy yield pieces, using their teeth as mechanoreceptors to distinguish them. After feeding for several hours, the sharks appeared to become lethargic, no longer swimming to the surface; they were observed mouthing the carcass but apparently unable to bite hard enough to remove flesh, they would instead bounce off and slowly sink. Up to eight sharks were observed feeding simultaneously, bumping into each other without showing any signs of aggression; on one occasion a shark accidentally bit the head of a neighbouring shark, leaving two teeth embedded, but both continued to feed unperturbed. Smaller individuals hovered around the carcass eating chunks that drifted away. Unusually for the area, large numbers of sharks over five metres long were observed, suggesting that the largest sharks change their behaviour to search for whales as they lose the manoeuvrability required to hunt seals. The investigating team concluded that the importance of whale carcasses, particularly for the largest white sharks, has been underestimated.<ref name=\"KrkosekFallows2013\">{{cite journal|last1=Krkosek|first1=Martin|last2=Fallows|first2=Chris|last3=Gallagher|first3=Austin J.|last4=Hammerschlag|first4=Neil|title=White Sharks (''Carcharodon carcharias'') Scavenging on Whales and Its Potential Role in Further Shaping the Ecology of an Apex Predator|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=8|issue=4|year=2013|pages=e60797|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0060797|pmid=23585850|pmc=3621969}}</ref> In another documented incident, white sharks were observed scavenging on a whale carcass alongside tiger sharks.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dudley |first=Sheldon F.

Many of the incidents seemed to be \"test-bites\". Great white sharks also test-bite [[buoy]]s, [[flotsam]], and other unfamiliar objects, and they might grab a human or a [[surfboard]] to identify what it is.\n[[File:Surfacing great white shark.jpg|thumb|left|The great white shark is one of only four kinds of shark that have been involved in a significant number of fatal unprovoked attacks on humans.|alt=Photo of open-mouthed shark at surface.]]\nContrary to popular belief, great white sharks do not mistake humans for seals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/01/0123_040123_tvgreatwhiteshark.html|title=Great White Shark Attacks: Defanging the Myths|work=nationalgeographic.com}}</ref> Many bite incidents occur in waters with low visibility or other situations which impair the shark's senses. The species appears to not like the taste of humans, or at least finds the taste unfamiliar. Further research shows that they can tell in one bite whether or not the object is worth predating upon. Humans, for the most part, are too bony for their liking. They much prefer seals, which are fat and rich in protein.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elasmo-research.org/education/white_shark/mistaken_identity.htm|title=White Shark Attacks: Mistaken Identity|last=Martin|first=R.

Accordingly, in most recorded shark bite incidents, great whites broke off contact after the first bite. Fatalities are usually caused by blood loss from the initial bite rather than from critical organ loss or from whole consumption. From 1990 to 2011 there have been a total of 139 unprovoked great white shark bite incidents, 29 of which were fatal.<ref>{{cite web|title=ISAF Statistics for Worldwide Unprovoked White Shark Attacks Since 1990|url=http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/sharks/White/whitesharkdecade.html|date=10 February 2011|accessdate=19 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nHowever, some researchers have hypothesized that the reason the proportion of fatalities is low is not because sharks do not like human flesh, but because humans are often able to escape after the first bite. In the 1980s, John McCosker, Chair of Aquatic Biology at the [[California Academy of Sciences]], noted that divers who dove solo and were bitten by great whites were generally at least partially consumed, while divers who followed the buddy system were generally rescued by their companion. McCosker and Timothy C. Tricas, an author and professor at the [[University of Hawaii]], suggest that a standard pattern for great whites is to make an initial devastating attack and then wait for the prey to weaken before consuming the wounded animal. Humans' ability to move out of reach with the help of others, thus foiling the attack, is unusual for a great white's prey.<ref>{{cite journal|first=T.C.|last=Tricas|author2=McCosker, John |journal=Proceedings of the California Academy of Sciences |series=Series 4 |title=Predatory behavior of the white shark, ''Carcharodon carcharias'', and notes on its biology|volume=43|issue=14|pages=221\u2013238|year=1984 |url=https://archive.org/details/cbarchive_109514_predatorybehaviourofthewhitesh1982}}</ref>\n\n=== Shark culling ===\n{{Main|shark culling}}\n\n[[Shark culling]] is the deliberate killing of sharks by a government in an attempt to reduce [[shark attack]]s; shark culling is often called \"shark control\".<ref name=\"shark_culling\"/> These programs have been criticized by environmentalists and scientists\u2014they say these programs harm the [[marine ecosystem]]; they also say such programs are \"outdated, cruel, and ineffective\".<ref>{{citation |url=https://www.ntd.tv/2018/09/04/video-endangered-hammerhead-sharks-dead-on-drum-line-in-great-barrier-reef/ |last=Phillips |first=Jack |date=4 September 2018 |title=Video: Endangered Hammerhead Sharks Dead on Drum Line in Great Barrier Reef |publisher=Ntd.tv |access-date=30 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180919094449/https://www.ntd.tv/2018/09/04/video-endangered-hammerhead-sharks-dead-on-drum-line-in-great-barrier-reef/ |archive-date=19 September 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Many different species ([[dolphins]], [[turtles]], etc.) are also killed in these programs (because of their use of [[shark nets]] and [[drum line (shark control)|drum lines]])\u201415,135 marine animals were killed in New South Wales' nets between 1950 and 2008,<ref name=\"shark_culling\"/> and 84,000 marine animals were killed by Queensland authorities from 1962 to 2015.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.afd.org.au/news-articles/queenslands-shark-control-program-has-snagged-84000-animals |title=Action for Dolphins.

Also, responsible dive operators do not feed sharks. Only sharks that are willing to scavenge follow the chum trail and if they find no food at the end then the shark soon swims off and does not associate chum with a meal.

A single set of great white jaws can fetch up to \u00a320,000. That is a fraction of the tourism value of a live shark; tourism is a more sustainable economic activity than shark fishing. For example, the dive industry in [[Gansbaai]], South Africa consists of six boat operators with each boat guiding 30 people each day. With fees between \u00a350 and \u00a3150 per person, a single live shark that visits each boat can create anywhere between \u00a39,000 and \u00a327,000 of revenue daily.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Chuming the water.jpg|alt=Photo of man dropping chum off the side of a boat|Putting [[chumming|chum]] in the [[water]]\nFile:Great white Dyer island 2010-07.jpg|A great white shark approaches divers in a cage off Dyer Island, Western Cape, South Africa\nFile:Great white shark and cage diving 2.wmv.OGG|A great white shark approaches a cage\nFile:White shark cage diving, Gansbaai.jpg|Tourists in a cage near [[Gansbaai]] \n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Sharks}}\n* [[List of sharks]]\n* [[List of threatened sharks]]\n* [[Outline of sharks]]\n* [[Shark culling]]\n** [[Western Australian shark cull]]\n\n=== Books ===\n* ''[[The Devil's Teeth]]'' by Susan Casey\n* ''[[Close to Shore]]'' by [[Michael Capuzzo]] about the [[Jersey Shore shark attacks of 1916]]\n* ''[[Twelve Days of Terror]]'' by Richard Fernicola about the same events\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drf7jV_l6IE Great white feasting on a whale's carcass]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC8Wxfn5xFw Great white survives attack by orcas (killer whales)] near Neptune Islands, Australia\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbQ5qCJEEwc Great white and orca fight] off the coast of California\n* [https://www.facebook.com/OceansResearch/videos/420059681992976 Great whites with a pod of orcas] off the coast of South Africa\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMsyssBXRsQ Ocean Ramsey Encounters GIANT] {{cvt|20|ft|m}} Great White Shark, near Oahu, Hawaii\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-zvg279EPY Longest Shark Ever Recorded!]\n* [https://www.animalsaroundtheglobe.com/great-white-shark-diving-where-you-need-to-go/ Great White Shark Diving Locations]\n\n\n{{Good article}}\n{{Shark nav}}\n{{Lamniformes}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q129026}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:shark, white, great}}\n[[Category:Carcharodon|great white shark]]\n[[Category:Ovoviviparous fish]]\n[[Category:Scavengers]]\n[[Category:Cosmopolitan fish]]\n[[Category:Extant Miocene first appearances]]\n[[Category:Fish described in 1758|great white shark]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus|great white shark]]\n", "text_old": "{{other uses of|great white|Great White (disambiguation)}}\n{{redirect|White shark|the novel|White Shark (novel)}}\n{{pp-semi-indef}}\n{{short description|Species of large lamniform shark}}\n{{Use British English Oxford spelling|date=April 2020}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{Speciesbox\n|name=Great white shark\n|fossil_range={{Fossilrange|16|0|ref=<ref name=\"CA\"/>}} <small>[[Miocene]] to Recent</small>\n|image=White shark.jpg\n|image_upright=1.1\n|image2=Great white shark size comparison.svg\n|image2_alt=Illustration showing a shark and a human diver.

Great whites are so sensitive they can detect variations of half a billionth of a [[volt]]. At close range, this allows the shark to locate even immobile animals by detecting their heartbeat. Most fish have a less-developed but similar sense using their body's [[lateral line]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The physiology of the ampullae of Lorenzini in sharks|url=http://www.bio.davidson.edu/people/midorcas/animalphysiology/websites/2005/DiLuzio/index.htm|work=Biology Dept., Davidson College|publisher=Biology @ Davidson|accessdate=20 August 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124035534/http://www.bio.davidson.edu/people/midorcas/animalphysiology/websites/2005/DiLuzio/index.htm|archivedate=24 November 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[File:White shark1.jpg|thumb|Shark biting into the fish head teaser bait next to a cage in [[False Bay]], South Africa]]\n\nTo more successfully hunt fast and agile prey such as sea lions, the great white has adapted to maintain a body temperature warmer than the surrounding water. One of these adaptations is a \"[[rete mirabile]]\" (Latin for \"wonderful net\"). This close web-like structure of veins and arteries, located along each lateral side of the shark, conserves heat by warming the cooler arterial blood with the venous blood that has been warmed by the working muscles. This keeps certain parts of the body (particularly the stomach) at temperatures up to {{cvt|14|C-change|F-change}} <ref>{{cite web|last=Martin|first=R.

When conserving energy, the core body temperature can drop to match the surroundings. A great white shark's success in raising its [[core temperature]] is an example of [[gigantothermy]].

When hunting, great whites tend to separate and resolve conflicts with rituals and displays. White sharks rarely resort to combat although some individuals have been found with bite marks that match those of other white sharks. This suggests that when a great white approaches too closely to another, they react with a warning bite. Another possibility is that white sharks bite to show their dominance.\n\nThe great white shark is one of only a few sharks known to regularly lift its head above the sea surface to gaze at other objects such as prey. This is known as [[Spyhopping|spy-hopping]]. This behaviour has also been seen in at least one group of [[blacktip reef shark]]s, but this might be learned from interaction with humans (it is theorized that the shark may also be able to smell better this way because smell travels through air faster than through water). White sharks are generally very curious animals, display intelligence and may also turn to socializing if the situation demands it. At Seal Island, white sharks have been observed arriving and departing in stable \"clans\" of two to six individuals on a yearly basis. Whether clan members are related is unknown, but they get along peacefully enough. In fact, the social structure of a clan is probably most aptly compared to that of a wolf pack; in that each member has a clearly established rank and each clan has an alpha leader. When members of different clans meet, they establish social rank nonviolently through any of a variety of interactions.<ref name=\"NHmag\">{{cite web|url=http://www.naturalhistorymag.com/picks-from-the-past/201391/sociable-killers|title=Sociable Killers|author1=Martin, R.

However, this has rarely been observed due to whales dying in remote areas. It has been estimated that {{cvt|30|kg}} of whale blubber could feed a {{cvt|4.5|m|ft}} white shark for 1.5 months. Detailed observations were made of four whale carcasses in False Bay between 2000 and 2010. Sharks were drawn to the carcass by chemical and odour detection, spread by strong winds. After initially feeding on the whale caudal peduncle and [[fluke (tail)|fluke]], the sharks would investigate the carcass by slowly swimming around it and mouthing several parts before selecting a blubber-rich area. During feeding bouts of 15\u201320 seconds the sharks removed flesh with lateral headshakes, without the protective ocular rotation they employ when attacking live prey. The sharks were frequently observed regurgitating chunks of blubber and immediately returning to feed, possibly in order to replace low energy yield pieces with high energy yield pieces, using their teeth as mechanoreceptors to distinguish them. After feeding for several hours, the sharks appeared to become lethargic, no longer swimming to the surface; they were observed mouthing the carcass but apparently unable to bite hard enough to remove flesh, they would instead bounce off and slowly sink. Up to eight sharks were observed feeding simultaneously, bumping into each other without showing any signs of aggression; on one occasion a shark accidentally bit the head of a neighbouring shark, leaving two teeth embedded, but both continued to feed unperturbed. Smaller individuals hovered around the carcass eating chunks that drifted away. Unusually for the area, large numbers of sharks over five metres long were observed, suggesting that the largest sharks change their behaviour to search for whales as they lose the manoeuvrability required to hunt seals. The investigating team concluded that the importance of whale carcasses, particularly for the largest white sharks, has been underestimated.<ref name=\"KrkosekFallows2013\">{{cite journal|last1=Krkosek|first1=Martin|last2=Fallows|first2=Chris|last3=Gallagher|first3=Austin J.|last4=Hammerschlag|first4=Neil|title=White Sharks (''Carcharodon carcharias'') Scavenging on Whales and Its Potential Role in Further Shaping the Ecology of an Apex Predator|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=8|issue=4|year=2013|pages=e60797|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0060797|pmid=23585850|pmc=3621969}}</ref> In another documented incident, white sharks were observed scavenging on a whale carcass alongside tiger sharks.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dudley |first=Sheldon F.

Many of the incidents seemed to be \"test-bites\". Great white sharks also test-bite [[buoy]]s, [[flotsam]], and other unfamiliar objects, and they might grab a human or a [[surfboard]] to identify what it is.\n[[File:Surfacing great white shark.jpg|thumb|left|The great white shark is one of only four kinds of shark that have been involved in a significant number of fatal unprovoked attacks on humans.|alt=Photo of open-mouthed shark at surface.]]\nContrary to popular belief, great white sharks do not mistake humans for seals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/01/0123_040123_tvgreatwhiteshark.html|title=Great White Shark Attacks: Defanging the Myths|work=nationalgeographic.com}}</ref> Many bite incidents occur in waters with low visibility or other situations which impair the shark's senses. The species appears to not like the taste of humans, or at least finds the taste unfamiliar. Further research shows that they can tell in one bite whether or not the object is worth predating upon. Humans, for the most part, are too bony for their liking. They much prefer seals, which are fat and rich in protein.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elasmo-research.org/education/white_shark/mistaken_identity.htm|title=White Shark Attacks: Mistaken Identity|last=Martin|first=R.

Accordingly, in most recorded shark bite incidents, great whites broke off contact after the first bite. Fatalities are usually caused by blood loss from the initial bite rather than from critical organ loss or from whole consumption. From 1990 to 2011 there have been a total of 139 unprovoked great white shark bite incidents, 29 of which were fatal.<ref>{{cite web|title=ISAF Statistics for Worldwide Unprovoked White Shark Attacks Since 1990|url=http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/sharks/White/whitesharkdecade.html|date=10 February 2011|accessdate=19 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nHowever, some researchers have hypothesized that the reason the proportion of fatalities is low is not because sharks do not like human flesh, but because humans are often able to escape after the first bite. In the 1980s, John McCosker, Chair of Aquatic Biology at the [[California Academy of Sciences]], noted that divers who dove solo and were bitten by great whites were generally at least partially consumed, while divers who followed the buddy system were generally rescued by their companion. McCosker and Timothy C. Tricas, an author and professor at the [[University of Hawaii]], suggest that a standard pattern for great whites is to make an initial devastating attack and then wait for the prey to weaken before consuming the wounded animal. Humans' ability to move out of reach with the help of others, thus foiling the attack, is unusual for a great white's prey.<ref>{{cite journal|first=T.C.|last=Tricas|author2=McCosker, John |journal=Proceedings of the California Academy of Sciences |series=Series 4 |title=Predatory behavior of the white shark, ''Carcharodon carcharias'', and notes on its biology|volume=43|issue=14|pages=221\u2013238|year=1984 |url=https://archive.org/details/cbarchive_109514_predatorybehaviourofthewhitesh1982}}</ref>\n\n=== Shark culling ===\n{{Main|shark culling}}\n\n[[Shark culling]] is the deliberate killing of sharks by a government in an attempt to reduce [[shark attack]]s; shark culling is often called \"shark control\".<ref name=\"shark_culling\"/> These programs have been criticized by environmentalists and scientists\u2014they say these programs harm the [[marine ecosystem]]; they also say such programs are \"outdated, cruel, and ineffective\".<ref>{{citation |url=https://www.ntd.tv/2018/09/04/video-endangered-hammerhead-sharks-dead-on-drum-line-in-great-barrier-reef/ |last=Phillips |first=Jack |date=4 September 2018 |title=Video: Endangered Hammerhead Sharks Dead on Drum Line in Great Barrier Reef |publisher=Ntd.tv |access-date=30 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180919094449/https://www.ntd.tv/2018/09/04/video-endangered-hammerhead-sharks-dead-on-drum-line-in-great-barrier-reef/ |archive-date=19 September 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Many different species ([[dolphins]], [[turtles]], etc.) are also killed in these programs (because of their use of [[shark nets]] and [[drum line (shark control)|drum lines]])\u201415,135 marine animals were killed in New South Wales' nets between 1950 and 2008,<ref name=\"shark_culling\"/> and 84,000 marine animals were killed by Queensland authorities from 1962 to 2015.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.afd.org.au/news-articles/queenslands-shark-control-program-has-snagged-84000-animals |title=Action for Dolphins.

Also, responsible dive operators do not feed sharks. Only sharks that are willing to scavenge follow the chum trail and if they find no food at the end then the shark soon swims off and does not associate chum with a meal. It has been suggested that government licensing strategies may help enforce these responsible tourism.<ref name=\"www.bluewaterhunter.com\"/>\n\nThe shark tourist industry has some financial leverage in conserving this animal. A single set of great white jaws can fetch up to \u00a320,000. That is a fraction of the tourism value of a live shark; tourism is a more sustainable economic activity than shark fishing. For example, the dive industry in [[Gansbaai]], South Africa consists of six boat operators with each boat guiding 30 people each day. With fees between \u00a350 and \u00a3150 per person, a single live shark that visits each boat can create anywhere between \u00a39,000 and \u00a327,000 of revenue daily.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Chuming the water.jpg|alt=Photo of man dropping chum off the side of a boat|Putting [[chumming|chum]] in the [[water]]\nFile:Great white Dyer island 2010-07.jpg|A great white shark approaches divers in a cage off Dyer Island, Western Cape, South Africa\nFile:Great white shark and cage diving 2.wmv.OGG|A great white shark approaches a cage\nFile:White shark cage diving, Gansbaai.jpg|Tourists in a cage near [[Gansbaai]] \n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Sharks}}\n* [[List of sharks]]\n* [[List of threatened sharks]]\n* [[Outline of sharks]]\n* [[Shark culling]]\n** [[Western Australian shark cull]]\n\n=== Books ===\n* ''[[The Devil's Teeth]]'' by Susan Casey\n* ''[[Close to Shore]]'' by [[Michael Capuzzo]] about the [[Jersey Shore shark attacks of 1916]]\n* ''[[Twelve Days of Terror]]'' by Richard Fernicola about the same events\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drf7jV_l6IE Great white feasting on a whale's carcass]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC8Wxfn5xFw Great white survives attack by orcas (killer whales)] near Neptune Islands, Australia\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbQ5qCJEEwc Great white and orca fight] off the coast of California\n* [https://www.facebook.com/OceansResearch/videos/420059681992976 Great whites with a pod of orcas] off the coast of South Africa\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMsyssBXRsQ Ocean Ramsey Encounters GIANT] {{cvt|20|ft|m}} Great White Shark, near Oahu, Hawaii\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-zvg279EPY Longest Shark Ever Recorded!]\n\n{{Good article}}\n{{Shark nav}}\n{{Lamniformes}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q129026}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:shark, white, great}}\n[[Category:Carcharodon|great white shark]]\n[[Category:Ovoviviparous fish]]\n[[Category:Scavengers]]\n[[Category:Cosmopolitan fish]]\n[[Category:Extant Miocene first appearances]]\n[[Category:Fish described in 1758|great white shark]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus|great white shark]]\n", "name_user": "Laura.Hofer", "label": "safe", "comment": "Edited the section where to see great white sharks", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_white_shark"}

No. 2 Column on the coast was to begin its advance at the Tugela River. No. 3 Column in the centre was to cross Rorke's Grift and advance {{convert|85|mi|km|abbr=on}} to the capital. No. 4 Column (Colonel [[Evelyn Wood (British Army officer)|Evelyn Wood]]) had to advance the shortest distance, about {{convert|75|mi|km|abbr=on}}. Wood was to move slowly to enable No. 1 Column to catch up. No. 4 Column consisted of eight infantry companies from the 13th and 90th Light Infantry, with about {{nowrap|1,500 men,}} four [[RML 7-pounder Mountain Gun|7-pounder]] mountain guns of the 11th Battery, 7th Brigade (11/7) [[Royal Artillery|RA]], roughly 200 cavalry of the [[Frontier Light Horse]] (FLH) and the civilian followers of Piet Uys and Wood's Irrregulars, 300 African infantry along with ox-wagon transport and impedimenta, about 2,000 infantry and 200 cavalry all told.{{sfn|Lock|1995|pp=38\u201339}}\n\n== Prelude ==\n\nNo. 4 Column was to occupy the attention of those [[Zulu people|Zulus]] dwelling on the flat-topped mountains rising out of the plains of north-west [[Zulu Kingdom|Zululand]]. The distance of these Zulus from the capital of [[Ulundi]] gave them a degree of independence from [[Cetshwayo]], enabling the chiefs to withhold their warriors for local defence, rather than contributing to the main Zulu Army. Chelmsford required these Zulus to be distracted so that they would not interfere with the operations of No.&nbsp;3 Column during its advance to [[Isandlwana]] and onto Ulundi.\n\nOn 17 January 1879, Wood advanced his column north-eastwards and a [[laager]] (a defensive wagon circle) was established at [[Tinta's Kraal]], {{convert|10|mi|km|abbr=on}} south of a chain of flat-topped mountains on 20 January. These were [[Zunguin]], [[Hlobane]] and [[Ityentika]], connected by a nek and running for {{convert|15|mi|km|abbr=on}} in a north-easterly direction. While the camp was being fortified, scouts investigating the mountains were attacked from Zunguin by about {{nowrap|1,000 Zulu.}} At dawn the next day an attack was mounted on Zunguin and the Zulus fled to Hlobane, where Wood observed about {{nowrap|4,000 Zulu}} drilling that afternoon. An attack on Hlobane began on 24 January but was cancelled, after Wood learnt of the British defeat at the [[Battle of Isandlwana]]. After falling back to Tinta's Kraal, Wood decided to move his column north-westwards to [[Kambula hill]], about {{cvt|14|mi|km}} due west of Zunguin. Their arrival on 31 January was met with a message from Chelmsford informing Wood that all orders were cancelled, he was now on his own with no expectation of reinforcements and that he must be prepared to face the whole Zulu Army.\n\n== Kambula ==\n[[File:RML 7 pounder steel fort nelson.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Example of an Ordnance [[Rifled muzzle loader]] (RML) [[RML 7-pounder Mountain Gun|7-pounder gun]]}}]]\nFebruary 1879 passed quietly, save for mounted patrols sent out daily to raid the kraals of Zulus harassing {{nowrap|No 5 Column}} across the eastern [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]] border. At [[Kambula]], a hexagonal laager was formed with tightly locked together wagons; a separate kraal for the cattle was constructed on the edge of the southern face of the ridge. Trenches and earth parapets surrounded both and a stone-built redoubt was built on a rise just north of the kraal. A [[palisade]] blocked the {{cvt|100|yd|m}} between the kraal and redoubt and four 7-pounders were positioned between the redoubt and the laager to cover the northern approaches. Two more guns in the redoubt covered the north-east. Wood received much needed reinforcements in the form of [[Transvaal Rangers]], mounted troops, a troop of German settlers and five companies of the [[80th Regiment of Foot (Staffordshire Volunteers)|80th Regiment of Foot]].\n\nWood had hoped detach the Zulus in the area from their allegiance to Cetshwayo, particularly [[Uhamu]], Cetshwayo's half-brother, who had always been friendly towards the British and at odds with the Zulu King. On 13 March, Uhamu entered the camp with about 700 followers, requesting escorts to bring the rest of his people out of hiding. They were in caves near the headwaters of the [[Black Umfolozi River|Black Umfolozi]], {{cvt|50|mi|km}} to the east and only {{convert|40|mi|km|-1|abbr=on}} from Ulundi. It would be risky to escort large numbers to safety over this area but Wood considered the advantages made it worthwhile. An escort of {{nowrap|360 British}} mounted troops and about 200 of Uhamu's warriors returned to Kambula with another {{nowrap|900 refugees.}} Shortly afterwards, Wood received a request from Chelmsford to create a distraction to draw off some of the Zulu strength, while he tried to intervene in the [[Battle of Eshowe]]. Knowing that an [[impi]] was preparing to leave Ulundi and attack either Kambula or the British fort at Utrecht, Wood reckoned that by attacking Hlobane on 28 March he could drive cattle off the mountain, prompting the impi to attack him in his prepared position at Kambula.\n\n== Battle ==\nHlobane consisted of two plateaux, the lower and smaller of which rose to a height of about {{convert|850|ft|m|abbr=on}} at the eastern end of the {{convert|4|mi|km|abbr=on}}-long [[col|nek]] connecting it to Zunguin to the south-west. At the eastern end of this lower plateau the ground rose very steeply for another {{convert|200|ft|m|-1|abbr=on}} up a narrow, boulder-strewn way, forming a series of giant steps, known as Devil's Pass, to the higher plateau. On the top of this plateau were about {{nowrap|2,000 cattle}} and approcimately {{nowrap|1,000 [[abaQulusi]]}} Zulu. Wood's plan was for mounted troops led by Lieutenant-Colonel [[Redvers Henry Buller|Redvers Buller]] to scale the eastern track to the higher plateau, supported by rocket artillery and friendly Zulu to lift the cattle. A similar force, under Major [[R. A. Russell]], would occupy the lower plateau.\n\nAt dawn on 27 March the forces departed, hampered by a thunderstorm and Zulu sniping by the light of lightning flashes. Buller's mounted troops reached the summit by {{nowrap|6:00 a.m.}} the following day and African infantry began herding cattle westwards. As Russell's troops occupied the lower plateau, Wood encountered a group of the Border Horse who had become detached from Buller's advance up the higher plateau. Wood ordered them to advance towards the firing on the upper plateau but the men, mostly English settlers from Transvaal, refused. Wood rode on with his small party, intending to follow Buller's track up to the summit and was eventually followed by the Border Horse. Coming under fire from caves, as had Buller's men, Wood was again defied by the Border Horse when he ordered them to clear the way forward. Five of Wood's escorts charged the caves; Wood's staff officer Captain [[R. Campbell]] and his political agent, {{nowrap|Mr. Lloyd,}} were killed. The group moved westwards to join Russell on the lower plateau.\n\nAt {{nowrap|10:30 a.m.,}} while Wood was riding along the southern flank of Hlobane he spotted five large columns of Zulu to the south-east. This was the main impi, which he had not expected to arrive for another day and was closing on the British fast, only {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} away. The impi was already dispersing and Wood could see that they would block Buller's retreat from the upper plateau and then trap Russell. Even if Wood withdrew both groups, they would have to make a rapid retreat to Kambula to get there before the Zulu. Wood hurriedly sent a message to Russell, ordering him to move up to the nek but with the advantage of high ground, Russell had already seen the impi, an hour and a half before Wood and sent a warning to Buller.\n\nBuller realised his predicament; turning back was impossible, the only option was to make for the lower plateau and rendezvous with Russell's force. Russell had moved his troops off the lower plateau to Intyentika Nek to support Buller's troops as they descended. When Wood's orders arrived, Russell and his officers took it that Wood wished for them to take up positions on another nek, {{convert|6|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} westwards, by Zunguin. Leaving a small number of troops, Russell's force departed in that direction, leaving Buller alone at Hlobane.\n\nBuller's troops could only reach the lower plateau through Devil's Pass. The dangerous traverse was the cause of much confusion among his troopers with their unsettled horses, which led to casualties. This danger was heightened by the abaQulusi, who after they saw the approaching Zulu army, became more confident and daring in their attacks on the withdrawing troops; the British had to fight their way through the pass. Despite the danger, the British were able to get off the plateau and onto the plains, where Buller ordered them to make for Kambula. The force was broken and disorganised, many horses had been lost the men were required to ride [[pillion]] to make it to Kambula but they eventually arrived. The Zulu impi reached the plain shortly after the British had departed and followed them for {{convert|12|mi|km|-1|abbr=on}}, skirmishing on all sides.\n\n== Aftermath ==\n===Analysis===\nThe Battle of Hlobane was a Zulu victory; the Border Horse, trapped and unable to retreat to Kambula, was annihilated and the battalions of Zulu helping the British decamped. Wood was confident that the Zulu impi would attack the defensive works at Kambula as he hoped and he expected victory. The following day, at the [[Battle of Kambula]], the Zulu army was routed.\n\n===Casualties===\nFifteen officers and {{nowrap|110 British}} soldiers were killed, eight were wounded and {{nowrap|100 African}} soldiers died. The loss in horses gravely weakened Wood's mobility.\n\n===Victoria Cross===\nColonel Buller received the [[Victoria Cross]] for his conspicuous gallantry and leadership, as did Lieutenant [[Henry Lysons]] and Private [[Edmund John Fowler|Edmund Fowler]] for charging the caves that morning. Major [[William Knox Leet|William Leet]] and Lieutenant [[Edward Stevenson Browne|Edward Browne]] were awarded the VC for going back to save the lives of wounded men at the descent of Devil's Pass.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Military history of South Africa]]\n* [http://www.rorkesdriftvc.com/hlobane.htm Horror at the Devil\u2019s Pass \u2013 The Battle of Hlobane, 28 March 1879]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Laband|2009}}\n|last=Laband |first=John |authorlink=|title=Historical Dictionary of the Zulu Wars |publisher=Scarecrow Press |year=2009 |location=Lanham, Maryland |isbn=978-0-8108-6078-0}}\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Lock|1995}}\n |last=Lock |first=R. |title=Blood on the Painted Mountain: Zulu Victory and Defeat, Hlobane and Kambula, 1879 |year=1995 |publisher=Greenhill Books |location=London |isbn=1-85367-201-7}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last=Barthorp |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Barthorp |title=The Zulu War: Isandhlwana to Ulundi |year=2002 |publisher=[[Weidenfeld & Nicolson]] |isbn=0-304-36270-0}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Brookes |first1=Edgar H. |last2=Webb |first2=Colin de B. |title=A History of Natal |publisher=[[University of Natal Press]] |year=1965 |location=[[Brooklyn]] |isbn=0-86980-579-7}}\n* {{cite book |last=Colenso |first=Frances E. |others=Assisted by Edward Durnford |year=1880 |title=History of the Zulu War and its Origin |location=London |publisher=[[Chapman & Hall]] |url=https://archive.org/details/historyofzuluwar00colerich |accessdate=16 July 2019 |oclc=251961801}}\n* {{cite book |last=Gump |first=James O. |authorlink= |title=The Dust Rose Like Smoke; The Subjugation of the Zulu and the Sioux |series=Bison books |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |year=1996 |location=Lincoln, Nebraska |isbn=0-8032-7059-3 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/dustroselikesmok0000gump_x5e4 }}\n* {{cite book |last=Knight |first=Ian |authorlink=|title=The Anglo-Zulu War |publisher=Osprey |year=2003 |location=Oxford |isbn=1-84176-612-7}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Laband |first1=John |authorlink=|last2=Knight |first2=Ian |title=The Anglo-Zulu War |publisher=[[The History Press|Sutton]] |year=1996 |location=[[Stroud]] |isbn=0-86985-829-7}}\n* {{cite book |last=Martineau |first=John |authorlink=|title=The life and Correspondence of the Sir Bartle Frere |url=https://archive.org/details/lifeandcorrespo00frergoog |publisher=John Murray |year=1895 |location=London |oclc=934940256}}\n* {{cite book |last=Morris |first=Donald R. |authorlink=|title=The Washing of the Spears |publisher=Da Capo Press |year=1998 |location=Boston, Massachusetts |isbn=0-306-80866-8}}\n* {{cite book |last=Raugh |first=Harold E.

No. 2 Column on the coast was to begin its advance at the Tugela River. No. 3 Column in the centre was to cross Rorke's Grift and advance {{convert|85|mi|km|abbr=on}} to the capital. No. 4 Column (Colonel [[Evelyn Wood (British Army officer)|Evelyn Wood]]) had to advance the shortest distance, about {{convert|75|mi|km|abbr=on}}. Wood was to move slowly to enable No. 1 Column to catch up. No. 4 Column consisted of eight infantry companies from the 13th and 90th Light Infantry, with about {{nowrap|1,500 men,}} four [[RML 7-pounder Mountain Gun|7-pounder]] mountain guns of the 11th Battery, 7th Brigade (11/7) [[Royal Artillery|RA]], roughly 200 cavalry of the [[Frontier Light Horse]] (FLH) and the civilian followers of Piet Uys and Wood's Irrregulars, 300 African infantry along with ox-wagon transport and impedimenta, about 2,000 infantry and 200 cavalry all told.{{sfn|Lock|1995|pp=38\u201339}}\n\n== Prelude ==\n\nNo. 4 Column was to occupy the attention of those [[Zulu people|Zulus]] dwelling on the flat-topped mountains rising out of the plains of north-west [[Zulu Kingdom|Zululand]]. The distance of these Zulus from the capital of [[Ulundi]] gave them a degree of independence from [[Cetshwayo]], enabling the chiefs to withhold their warriors for local defence, rather than contributing to the main Zulu Army. Chelmsford required these Zulus to be distracted so that they would not interfere with the operations of No.&nbsp;3 Column during its advance to [[Isandlwana]] and onto Ulundi.\n\nOn 17 January 1879, Wood advanced his column north-eastwards and a [[laager]] (a defensive wagon circle) was established at [[Tinta's Kraal]], {{convert|10|mi|km|abbr=on}} south of a chain of flat-topped mountains on 20 January. These were [[Zunguin]], [[Hlobane]] and [[Ityentika]], connected by a nek and running for {{convert|15|mi|km|abbr=on}} in a north-easterly direction. While the camp was being fortified, scouts investigating the mountains were attacked from Zunguin by about {{nowrap|1,000 Zulu.}} At dawn the next day an attack was mounted on Zunguin and the Zulus fled to Hlobane, where Wood observed about {{nowrap|4,000 Zulu}} drilling that afternoon. An attack on Hlobane began on 24 January but was cancelled, after Wood learnt of the British defeat at the [[Battle of Isandlwana]]. After falling back to Tinta's Kraal, Wood decided to move his column north-westwards to [[Kambula hill]], about {{cvt|14|mi|km}} due west of Zunguin. Their arrival on 31 January was met with a message from Chelmsford informing Wood that all orders were cancelled, he was now on his own with no expectation of reinforcements and that he must be prepared to face the whole Zulu Army.\n\n== Kambula ==\n[[File:RML 7 pounder steel fort nelson.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Example of an Ordnance [[Rifled muzzle loader]] (RML) [[RML 7-pounder Mountain Gun|7-pounder gun]]}}]]\nFebruary 1879 passed quietly, save for mounted patrols sent out daily to raid the kraals of Zulus harassing {{nowrap|No 5 Column}} across the eastern [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]] border. At [[Kambula]], a hexagonal laager was formed with tightly locked together wagons; a separate kraal for the cattle was constructed on the edge of the southern face of the ridge. Trenches and earth parapets surrounded both and a stone-built redoubt was built on a rise just north of the kraal. A [[palisade]] blocked the {{cvt|100|yd|m}} between the kraal and redoubt and four 7-pounders were positioned between the redoubt and the laager to cover the northern approaches. Two more guns in the redoubt covered the north-east. Wood received much needed reinforcements in the form of [[Transvaal Rangers]], mounted troops, a troop of German settlers and five companies of the [[80th Regiment of Foot (Staffordshire Volunteers)|80th Regiment of Foot]].\n\nWood had hoped detach the Zulus in the area from their allegiance to Cetshwayo, particularly [[Uhamu]], Cetshwayo's half-brother, who had always been friendly towards the British and at odds with the Zulu King. On 13 March, Uhamu entered the camp with about 700 followers, requesting escorts to bring the rest of his people out of hiding. They were in caves near the headwaters of the [[Black Umfolozi River|Black Umfolozi]], {{cvt|50|mi|km}} to the east and only {{convert|40|mi|km|-1|abbr=on}} from Ulundi. It would be risky to escort large numbers to safety over this area but Wood considered the advantages made it worthwhile. An escort of {{nowrap|360 British}} mounted troops and about 200 of Uhamu's warriors returned to Kambula with another {{nowrap|900 refugees.}} Shortly afterwards, Wood received a request from Chelmsford to create a distraction to draw off some of the Zulu strength, while he tried to intervene in the [[Battle of Eshowe]]. Knowing that an [[impi]] was preparing to leave Ulundi and attack either Kambula or the British fort at Utrecht, Wood reckoned that by attacking Hlobane on 28 March he could drive cattle off the mountain, prompting the impi to attack him in his prepared position at Kambula.\n\n== Battle ==\nHlobane consisted of two plateaux, the lower and smaller of which rose to a height of about {{convert|850|ft|m|abbr=on}} at the eastern end of the {{convert|4|mi|km|abbr=on}}-long [[col|nek]] connecting it to Zunguin to the south-west. At the eastern end of this lower plateau the ground rose very steeply for another {{convert|200|ft|m|-1|abbr=on}} up a narrow, boulder-strewn way, forming a series of giant steps, known as Devil's Pass, to the higher plateau. On the top of this plateau were about {{nowrap|2,000 cattle}} and approcimately {{nowrap|1,000 [[abaQulusi]]}} Zulu. Wood's plan was for mounted troops led by Lieutenant-Colonel [[Redvers Henry Buller|Redvers Buller]] to scale the eastern track to the higher plateau, supported by rocket artillery and friendly Zulu to lift the cattle. A similar force, under Major [[R. A. Russell]], would occupy the lower plateau.\n\nAt dawn on 27 March the forces departed, hampered by a thunderstorm and Zulu sniping by the light of lightning flashes. Buller's mounted troops reached the summit by {{nowrap|6:00 a.m.}} the following day and African infantry began herding cattle westwards. As Russell's troops occupied the lower plateau, Wood encountered a group of the Border Horse who had become detached from Buller's advance up the higher plateau. Wood ordered them to advance towards the firing on the upper plateau but the men, mostly English settlers from Transvaal, refused. Wood rode on with his small party, intending to follow Buller's track up to the summit and was eventually followed by the Border Horse. Coming under fire from caves, as had Buller's men, Wood was again defied by the Border Horse when he ordered them to clear the way forward. Five of Wood's escorts charged the caves; Wood's staff officer Captain [[R. Campbell]] and his political agent, {{nowrap|Mr. Lloyd,}} were killed. The group moved westwards to join Russell on the lower plateau.\n\nAt {{nowrap|10:30 a.m.,}} while Wood was riding along the southern flank of Hlobane he spotted five large columns of Zulu to the south-east. This was the main impi, which he had not expected to arrive for another day and was closing on the British fast, only {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} away. The impi was already dispersing and Wood could see that they would block Buller's retreat from the upper plateau and then trap Russell. Even if Wood withdrew both groups, they would have to make a rapid retreat to Kambula to get there before the Zulu. Wood hurriedly sent a message to Russell, ordering him to move up to the nek but with the advantage of high ground, Russell had already seen the impi, an hour and a half before Wood and sent a warning to Buller.\n\nBuller realised his predicament; turning back was impossible, the only option was to make for the lower plateau and rendezvous with Russell's force.
