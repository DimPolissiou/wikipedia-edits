The {{US$|720 million}} spacecraft was built by [[Lockheed Martin]] under the supervision of the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL). The mission is managed by the [[California Institute of Technology]], at the JPL, in [[Pasadena, California]], for the [[NASA]] [[Science Mission Directorate]], Washington, D.C. It was launched August 12, 2005, and attained Martian orbit on March 10, 2006. In November 2006, after five months of [[aerobraking]], it entered its final science orbit and began its primary science phase.\n\nMRO contains a host of scientific instruments such as cameras, [[spectrometer]]s, and [[radar]], which are used to analyze the [[landform]]s, [[stratigraphy]], minerals, and [[Water on Mars#Ice patches|ice of Mars]]. It paves the way for future spacecraft by monitoring Mars' daily [[Climate of Mars|weather]] and surface conditions, studying potential landing sites, and hosting a new telecommunications system. MRO's telecommunications system will [[data transmission|transfer more data]] back to Earth than all previous interplanetary missions combined, and MRO will serve as a highly capable relay satellite for future missions.<ref name=\"ant\"/> It has enough propellant to keep functioning into the 2030s.\n\n== Pre-launch ==\n[[File:A sonda MOR e a acao de seus instrumentos.jpg|thumb|Diagram of instrumentation aboard MRO]]\nOne of two missions considered for the 2003 Mars [[launch window]], the MRO proposal lost against what became known as the [[Mars Exploration Rovers]]. The orbiter mission was rescheduled for launch in 2005,<ref name=\"NASA GOES BACK TO THE FUTURE WITH PLANS FOR A MARS ROVER IN 2003\"/> and [[NASA]] announced its final name, ''Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter'', on October 26, 2000.<ref name=\"NASA Unveils Plans for 21st Century Mars Campaign\"/>\n\nMRO is modeled after NASA's highly successful ''[[Mars Global Surveyor]]'' to conduct surveillance of Mars from orbit. Early specifications of the satellite included a large camera to take high resolution pictures of Mars. In this regard, [[James B. Garvin]], the Mars exploration program scientist for NASA, proclaimed that MRO would be a \"microscope in orbit\".<ref name=\"NASA outlines Mars Missions\"/> The satellite was also to include a visible-near-infrared spectrograph.\n\nOn October 3, 2001, NASA chose [[Lockheed Martin]] as the primary contractor for the spacecraft's fabrication.<ref name=\"NASA Picks Lockheed Martin to Build 2005 Mars Craft\"/> By the end of 2001 all of the mission's instruments were selected. There were no major setbacks during MRO's construction, and the spacecraft was moved to [[John F. Kennedy Space Center]] on May 1, 2005 to prepare it for launch.<ref name=\"Moving Day For Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter\"/>\n\n== Mission objectives ==\n[[File:MRO-infographic-May2019.jpg|thumb|left|250px|<div align=\"center\">Infographic (May 2019)</div>]]\nMRO science operations were initially scheduled to last two Earth years, from November 2006 to November 2008. One of the mission's main goals is to map the Martian landscape with its high-resolution cameras in order to choose landing sites for future surface missions. The MRO played an important role in choosing the landing site of the [[Phoenix (spacecraft)|''Phoenix'' Lander]], which explored the Martian Arctic in [[Green Valley (Mars)|Green Valley]].<ref name=\"spaceflightnow\"/> The initial site chosen by scientists was imaged with the [[HiRISE|HiRISE camera]] and found to be littered with boulders. After analysis with HiRISE and the ''[[Mars Odyssey]]''{{'}}s THEMIS instrument a new site was chosen. ''[[Mars Science Laboratory]]'', a highly maneuverable rover, also had its landing site inspected. The MRO provided critical navigation data during their landings and acts as a telecommunications relay.\n\nMRO is using its onboard scientific equipment to study the [[Climate of Mars|Martian climate]], weather, atmosphere, and geology, and to search for signs of [[Water on Mars|liquid water]] in the [[polar caps]] and underground. In addition, MRO was tasked with looking for the remains of the previously lost [[Mars Polar Lander]] and ''[[Beagle 2]]'' spacecraft.<ref name=\"Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Overview\"/> ''Beagle&nbsp;2'' was found by the orbiter at the beginning of 2015.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Knapton|first1=Sarah|title=Beagle&nbsp;2 found on surface of Mars after vanishing for 12 years|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/11349163/Beagle-2-found-on-surface-of-Mars-after-vanishing-for-12-years.html|accessdate=March 3, 2015|publisher=The Telegraph|date=January 16, 2015}}</ref> After its main science operations are completed, the probe's extended mission is to be the communication and navigation system for landers and rover probes.<ref name=\"Mission Timeline: Communications Relay\"/>\n\n== Launch and orbital insertion ==\n[[File:MRO Liftoff.jpeg|thumb|100px|left|Launch of [[Atlas V]] carrying the ''Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter'', 11:43:00 UTC August 12, 2005]]\n[[File:MRO Transfer Orbit 2.png|thumb|Transfer orbit from Earth to Mars.

While en route most of the scientific instruments and experiments were tested and calibrated. To ensure proper [[orbital insertion]] upon reaching Mars, four [[trajectory]] correction maneuvers were planned and a fifth emergency maneuver was discussed.<ref name=\"Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter: Multimedia\"/> However, only three trajectory correction maneuvers were necessary, which saved {{Convert|60|lbs}} of fuel that would be usable during MRO's extended mission.<ref name=\"U.S. Spacecraft Enters Orbit Around Mars\"/>\n[[File:Animation of Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter trajectory around Mars.gif |thumb |right |Animation of ''Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter''{{'}}s trajectory around [[Mars]] from March 10, 2006 to September 30, 2007<br />{{legend2|magenta| Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter}}{{\u00b7}}{{legend2| Lime|[[Mars]]}}]]\nMRO began orbital insertion by approaching Mars on March 10, 2006, and passing above its southern hemisphere at an altitude of {{Convert|370|-|400|km|sp=us}}. All six of MRO's main engines burned for 27 minutes to slow the probe from {{Convert|2900|to|1900|m/s|sp=us}}. The helium pressurization tank was colder than expected, which reduced the pressure in the fuel tank by about {{Convert|21|kPa|lk=on}}. The reduced pressure caused the engine thrust to be diminished by 2%, but MRO automatically compensated by extending the burn time by 33 seconds.<ref name=\"spaceflightnow1\"/>\n\nCompletion of the orbital insertion placed the orbiter in a highly [[elliptic orbit|elliptical]] polar orbit with a period of approximately 35.5 hours.<ref name=\"New Mars Orbiter Ready for Action\"/> Shortly after insertion, the [[periapsis]] \u2013 the point in the orbit closest to Mars \u2013 was {{Convert|426|km|abbr=on}} from the surface<ref name=\"New Mars Orbiter Ready for Action\"/> ({{Convert|3806|km|abbr=on}} from the planet's center). The [[apoapsis]] \u2013 the point in the orbit farthest from Mars \u2013 was {{Convert|44500|km|abbr=on}} from the surface ({{Convert|47972|km|abbr=on}} from the planet's center).\n\nWhen MRO entered orbit, it joined five other active spacecraft that were either in orbit or on the planet's surface: ''[[Mars Global Surveyor]]'', ''[[Mars Express]]'', ''[[2001 Mars Odyssey]]'', and the two [[Mars Exploration Rover]]s (''[[Spirit (rover)|Spirit]]'' and ''[[Opportunity (rover)|Opportunity]]''). This set a new record for the most operational spacecraft in the immediate vicinity of Mars. ''Mars Global Surveyor'' and the rovers ''Spirit'' and ''Opportunity'' have since ceased to function. {{As of|2020|April|20}} , ''2001 Mars Odyssey'', ''Mars Express'' and MRO remain operational and have been joined by ''[[Mars Orbiter Mission]]'', ''[[MAVEN]]'' and ''[[ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter]]'' in orbit, and ''[[Curiosity (rover)|Curiosity]]'' and ''[[InSight]]'' on the surface, raising the record to eight active spacecraft.\n\n[[File:MRO Aerobrake.jpg|thumb|Artwork of MRO aerobraking]]\nOn March 30, 2006, MRO began the process of [[aerobraking]], a three-step procedure that cuts in half the fuel needed to achieve a lower, more circular orbit with a shorter period. First, during its first five orbits of the planet (one Earth week), MRO used its thrusters to drop the periapsis of its orbit into aerobraking altitude. This altitude depends on the thickness of the [[Atmosphere of Mars|atmosphere]] because Martian atmospheric density changes with its seasons. Second, while using its thrusters to make minor corrections to its periapsis altitude, MRO maintained aerobraking altitude for 445 planetary orbits (about five Earth months) to reduce the apoapsis of the orbit to {{convert|450|km|sp=us}}. This was done in such a way so as to not heat the spacecraft too much, but also dip enough into the atmosphere to slow the spacecraft down. After the process was complete, MRO used its thrusters to move its periapsis out of the edge of the Martian atmosphere on August 30, 2006.<ref name=\"aero\"/><ref name=\"Mars Orbiter Successfully Makes Big Burn\"/>\n\nIn September 2006 MRO fired its thrusters twice more to fine-tune its final, nearly circular orbit to approximately {{Convert|250|to|316|km|abbr=on}} above the Martian surface, with a period of about 112 minutes.<ref name=\"Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Reaches Planned Flight Path\"/><ref name=\"Fact Sheet: HiRISE\"/> The [[SHARAD|SHARAD radar]] antennas were deployed on September 16. All of the scientific instruments were tested and most were turned off prior to the [[solar conjunction]] that occurred from October 7 to November 6, 2006. After the conjunction ended the \"primary science phase\" began.\n\nOn November 17, 2006 NASA announced the successful test of the MRO as an orbital communications relay. Using the NASA rover ''[[Spirit rover|Spirit]]'' as the point of origin for the transmission, the MRO acted as a relay for transmitting data back to Earth.\n\n== Timeline ==\n{{See also|Timeline of the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter}}\n[[File:169384main pia09189-330.jpg|thumb|Tectonic fractures within the [[Candor Chasma]] region of [[Valles Marineris]], [[Mars]], retain ridge-like shapes as the surrounding bedrock erodes away. This points to past episodes of fluid alteration along the fractures and reveals clues into past fluid flow and geochemical conditions below the surface.]]\n\nOn September 29, 2006 ([[Timekeeping on Mars#Sols|sol]] {{age in sols|2005|08|12|2006|09|29}}), MRO took its first high resolution image from its science orbit. This image is said to resolve items as small as 90&nbsp;cm (3&nbsp;feet) in diameter. On October 6, [[NASA]] released detailed pictures from the MRO of [[Victoria crater]] along with the [[Opportunity rover|''Opportunity'' rover]] on the rim above it.<ref name=\"bbc\"/> In November, problems began to surface in the operation of two MRO spacecraft instruments. A stepping mechanism in the Mars Climate Sounder (MCS) skipped on multiple occasions resulting in a field of view that is slightly out of position.

Each battery has an energy storage capacity of 50&nbsp;[[ampere-hour]]s (180&nbsp;[[coulomb|kC]]). The full range of the batteries cannot be used due to voltage constraints on the spacecraft, but allows the operators to extend the battery life\u2014a valuable capability, given that battery drain is one of the most common causes of long-term satellite failure.

The [[Electra (radio)|Electra]] communications package is a [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] [[software-defined radio]] (SDR) that provides a flexible platform for evolving relay capabilities.<ref name=\"Electra\"/> It is designed to communicate with other spacecraft as they approach, land, and operate on Mars. The system consists of a very large ({{convert|3|m|abbr=on}}) antenna, which is used to transmit data through the [[Deep Space Network]] via [[X-band]] frequencies at 8&nbsp;[[Gigahertz|GHz]], and it demonstrates the use of the {{Ka band}} at 32&nbsp;GHz for higher data rates. Maximum transmission speed from Mars is projected to be as high as 6&nbsp;Mbit/s, a rate ten times higher than previous Mars orbiters. The spacecraft carries two 100-watt X-band [[amplifier]]s (one of which is a backup), one 35-watt K<sub>a</sub>-band amplifier, and two [[Small deep space transponder]]s (SDSTs).<ref name=ant/>\n\nTwo smaller low-gain antennas are also present for lower-rate communication during emergencies and special events, such as launch and Mars Orbit Insertion. These antennas do not have focusing dishes and can transmit and receive from any direction. They are an important backup system to ensure that MRO can always be reached, even if its main antenna is pointed away from the Earth.<ref name=ant/>\n\nThe K<sub>a</sub>-band subsystem was used for demonstration purposes. Due to lack of spectrum at 8.41&nbsp;GHz X-band, future high-rate deep space missions will use 32&nbsp;GHz K<sub>a</sub>-band. NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) implemented K<sub>a</sub>-band receiving capabilities at all three of its complexes (Goldstone, Canberra and Madrid) over its 34-m beam-waveguide (BWG) antenna subnet. During the cruise phase, spacecraft K<sub>a</sub>-band telemetry was tracked 36 times by these antennas proving functionality at all antennas. K<sub>a</sub>-band tests were also planned during the science phase, but during aerobraking a switch failed, limiting the X-band high gain antenna to a single amplifier.<ref name=\"MRO Waveguide Transfer Switch Anomaly\"/> If this amplifier fails all high-speed X-band communications will be lost. The K<sub>a</sub> downlink is the only remaining backup for this functionality, and since the K<sub>a</sub>-band capability of one of the SDST transponders has already failed,<ref name=\"CSAM Augments X-Ray Inspection of Die Attach (MRO Ka-Band Anomaly)\"/> (and the other might have the same problem) JPL decided to halt all K<sub>a</sub>-band demonstrations and hold the remaining capability in reserve.<ref name=\"In-Flight Anomalies and Lessons Learned from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Mission\"/>\n\nBy November 2013, the MRO had passed 200 terabits in the amount of science data returned.

A primary and backup [[Miniature Inertial Measurement Unit (MIMU)]], provided by [[Honeywell]], measures changes to the spacecraft attitude as well as any non-gravitationally induced changes to its linear velocity. Each MIMU is a combination of three [[accelerometer]]s and three ring-laser [[gyroscope]]s. These systems are all critically important to MRO, as it must be able to point its camera to a very high precision in order to take the high-quality pictures that the mission requires.

The ice was identified spectroscopically using CRISM.]]\nAn article in the journal ''Science'' in September 2009,<ref name=\"distribution\"/> reported that some new craters on Mars have excavated relatively pure water ice. After being exposed, the ice gradually fades as it sublimates away. These new craters were found and dated by the CTX camera, and the identification of the ice was confirmed with the Compact Imaging Spectrometer (CRISM) on board the ''Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter''. The ice was found in a total of five locations. Three of the locations are in the [[Cebrenia quadrangle]]. These locations are {{coord|55.57|N|150.62|E|globe:mars}}; {{coord|43.28|N|176.9|E|globe:mars}}; and {{coord|45|N|164.5|E|globe:mars}}. Two others are in the [[Diacria quadrangle]]: {{coord|46.7|N|176.8|E|globe:mars}} and {{coord|46.33|N|176.9|E|globe:mars}}.<ref name=\"Water Ice Exposed in Mars Craters\"/><ref name=\"NASA to Hold Teleconference to Discuss New Findings About Mars\"/>\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=\"190px\" heights=\"180px\">\nIceincraterscomparison.jpg|Two pictures from HiRISE showing how ice disappeared over time in a crater. The crater on the left is before ice disappeared. The crater is 6 meters in diameter and located in [[Cebrenia quadrangle]]..\n</gallery>\n\n=== Ice in lobate debris aprons ===\n[[File:Lobate Debris Apron in Phlegra Montes.JPG|thumb|[[Lobate debris apron]] in [[Phlegra Montes]], [[Cebrenia quadrangle]]. The debris apron is probably mostly ice with a thin covering of rock debris, so it could be a source of water for future Martian colonists. Scale bar is {{convert|500|m|abbr=on}}.]]\nRadar results from [[SHARAD]] suggested that features termed [[lobate debris apron]]s (LDAs) contain large amounts of water ice. Of interest from the days of the [[Viking]] Orbiters, these LDA are aprons of material surrounding cliffs. They have a convex topography and a gentle slope; this suggests flow away from the steep source cliff. In addition, lobate debris aprons can show surface lineations just as rock glaciers on the Earth.<ref>{{cite news |title=NASA Spacecraft Detects Buried Glaciers on Mars |url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=1957 |work=NASA/JPL |date=November 20, 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"Kieffer1992\"/> [[SHARAD]] has provided strong evidence that the LDAs in [[Hellas Planitia]] are [[glacier]]s that are covered with a thin layer of debris (i.e. rocks and dust); a strong reflection from the top and base of LDAs was observed, suggesting that pure water ice makes up the bulk of the formation (between the two reflections).<ref name=\"brown\"/> Based on the experiments of the [[Phoenix lander|''Phoenix'' lander]] and the studies of the [[Mars Odyssey]] from orbit, water ice is known to exist just under the surface of Mars in the far north and south (high latitudes).\n\n=== Chloride deposits ===\n[[File:Chloride deposits on Mars.JPG|thumb|Chloride deposits in Terra Sirenum]]\nUsing data from Mars Global Surveyor, Mars Odyssey and the ''Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter'', scientists have found widespread deposits of chloride minerals. Evidence suggests that the deposits were formed from the evaporation of mineral enriched waters. The research suggests that lakes may have been scattered over large areas of the Martian surface. Usually chlorides are the last minerals to come out of solution. Carbonates, sulfates, and silica should precipitate out ahead of them. Sulfates and silica have been found by the Mars rovers on the surface. Places with chloride minerals may have once held various life forms. Furthermore, such areas could preserve traces of ancient life.<ref name=\"materials\"/>\n\n=== Other aqueous minerals ===\nIn 2009, a group of scientists from the CRISM team reported on 9 to 10 different classes of minerals formed in the presence of water. Different types of [[clays]] (also called phyllosilicates) were found in many locations. The physilicates identified included aluminum smectite, iron/magnesium smectite, [[kaolinite]], [[prehnite]], and [[Chlorite group|chlorite]]. Rocks containing carbonate were found around the [[Isidis basin]]. [[Carbonates]] belong to one class in which life could have developed. Areas around [[Valles Marineris]] were found to contain hydrated [[silica]] and hydrated sulfates. The researchers identified hydrated sulfates and ferric minerals in [[Terra Meridiani]] and in [[Valles Marineris]]. Other minerals found on Mars were [[jarosite]], [[alunite]], [[hematite]], [[opal]], and [[gypsum]]. Two to five of the mineral classes were formed with the right [[pH]] and sufficient water to permit life to grow.<ref name=\"reconnaissance\"/>\n\n=== Avalanches ===\nThe ''Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter'' CTX and HiRISE cameras have photographed a number of avalanches off the scarps of the northern polar cap as they were occurring.<ref name=\"2008gl035790\"/>\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=\"190px\" heights=\"180px\">\nFour Martian avalanches, 2008.jpg|Martian avalanche and debris falls (HiRISE 2008)\nMars Avalanche with Scale.jpg |A photo with scale demonstrates the size of the avalanche.\n</gallery>\n\n=== Other spacecraft ===\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=\"190px\" heights=\"180px\">\nDescent of Phoenix with a crater in the background taken by Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.jpg|Image of ''[[Phoenix (spacecraft)|Phoenix]]'' landing on Mars, as seen by HiRISE.

The {{US$|720 million}} spacecraft was built by [[Lockheed Martin]] under the supervision of the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL). The mission is managed by the [[California Institute of Technology]], at the JPL, in [[Pasadena, California]], for the [[NASA]] [[Science Mission Directorate]], Washington, D.C. It was launched August 12, 2005, and attained Martian orbit on March 10, 2006. In November 2006, after five months of [[aerobraking]], it entered its final science orbit and began its primary science phase.\n\nMRO contains a host of scientific instruments such as cameras, [[spectrometer]]s, and [[radar]], which are used to analyze the [[landform]]s, [[stratigraphy]], minerals, and [[Water on Mars#Ice patches|ice of Mars]]. It paves the way for future spacecraft by monitoring Mars' daily [[Climate of Mars|weather]] and surface conditions, studying potential landing sites, and hosting a new telecommunications system. MRO's telecommunications system will [[data transmission|transfer more data]] back to Earth than all previous interplanetary missions combined, and MRO will serve as a highly capable relay satellite for future missions.<ref name=\"ant\"/> It has enough propellant to keep functioning into the 2030s.\n\n== Pre-launch ==\n[[File:A sonda MOR e a acao de seus instrumentos.jpg|thumb|Diagram of instrumentation aboard MRO]]\nOne of two missions considered for the 2003 Mars [[launch window]], the MRO proposal lost against what became known as the [[Mars Exploration Rovers]]. The orbiter mission was rescheduled for launch in 2005,<ref name=\"NASA GOES BACK TO THE FUTURE WITH PLANS FOR A MARS ROVER IN 2003\"/> and [[NASA]] announced its final name, ''Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter'', on October 26, 2000.<ref name=\"NASA Unveils Plans for 21st Century Mars Campaign\"/>\n\nMRO is modeled after NASA's highly successful ''[[Mars Global Surveyor]]'' to conduct surveillance of Mars from orbit. Early specifications of the satellite included a large camera to take high resolution pictures of Mars. In this regard, [[James B. Garvin]], the Mars exploration program scientist for NASA, proclaimed that MRO would be a \"microscope in orbit\".<ref name=\"NASA outlines Mars Missions\"/> The satellite was also to include a visible-near-infrared spectrograph.\n\nOn October 3, 2001, NASA chose [[Lockheed Martin]] as the primary contractor for the spacecraft's fabrication.<ref name=\"NASA Picks Lockheed Martin to Build 2005 Mars Craft\"/> By the end of 2001 all of the mission's instruments were selected. There were no major setbacks during MRO's construction, and the spacecraft was moved to [[John F. Kennedy Space Center]] on May 1, 2005 to prepare it for launch.<ref name=\"Moving Day For Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter\"/>\n\n== Mission objectives ==\n[[File:MRO-infographic-May2019.jpg|thumb|left|250px|<div align=\"center\">Infographic (May 2019)</div>]]\nMRO science operations were initially scheduled to last two Earth years, from November 2006 to November 2008. One of the mission's main goals is to map the Martian landscape with its high-resolution cameras in order to choose landing sites for future surface missions. The MRO played an important role in choosing the landing site of the [[Phoenix (spacecraft)|''Phoenix'' Lander]], which explored the Martian Arctic in [[Green Valley (Mars)|Green Valley]].<ref name=\"spaceflightnow\"/> The initial site chosen by scientists was imaged with the [[HiRISE|HiRISE camera]] and found to be littered with boulders. After analysis with HiRISE and the ''[[Mars Odyssey]]''{{'}}s THEMIS instrument a new site was chosen. ''[[Mars Science Laboratory]]'', a highly maneuverable rover, also had its landing site inspected. The MRO provided critical navigation data during their landings and acts as a telecommunications relay.\n\nMRO is using its onboard scientific equipment to study the [[Climate of Mars|Martian climate]], weather, atmosphere, and geology, and to search for signs of [[Water on Mars|liquid water]] in the [[polar caps]] and underground. In addition, MRO was tasked with looking for the remains of the previously lost [[Mars Polar Lander]] and ''[[Beagle 2]]'' spacecraft.<ref name=\"Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Overview\"/> ''Beagle&nbsp;2'' was found by the orbiter at the beginning of 2015.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Knapton|first1=Sarah|title=Beagle&nbsp;2 found on surface of Mars after vanishing for 12 years|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/11349163/Beagle-2-found-on-surface-of-Mars-after-vanishing-for-12-years.html|accessdate=March 3, 2015|publisher=The Telegraph|date=January 16, 2015}}</ref> After its main science operations are completed, the probe's extended mission is to be the communication and navigation system for landers and rover probes.<ref name=\"Mission Timeline: Communications Relay\"/>\n\n== Launch and orbital insertion ==\n[[File:MRO Liftoff.jpeg|thumb|100px|left|Launch of [[Atlas V]] carrying the ''Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter'', 11:43:00 UTC August 12, 2005]]\n[[File:MRO Transfer Orbit 2.png|thumb|Transfer orbit from Earth to Mars.

While en route most of the scientific instruments and experiments were tested and calibrated. To ensure proper [[orbital insertion]] upon reaching Mars, four [[trajectory]] correction maneuvers were planned and a fifth emergency maneuver was discussed.<ref name=\"Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter: Multimedia\"/> However, only three trajectory correction maneuvers were necessary, which saved {{Convert|60|lbs}} of fuel that would be usable during MRO's extended mission.<ref name=\"U.S. Spacecraft Enters Orbit Around Mars\"/>\n[[File:Animation of Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter trajectory around Mars.gif |thumb |right |Animation of ''Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter''{{'}}s trajectory around [[Mars]] from March 10, 2006 to September 30, 2007<br />{{legend2|magenta| Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter}}{{\u00b7}}{{legend2| Lime|[[Mars]]}}]]\nMRO began orbital insertion by approaching Mars on March 10, 2006, and passing above its southern hemisphere at an altitude of {{Convert|370|-|400|km|sp=us}}. All six of MRO's main engines burned for 27 minutes to slow the probe from {{Convert|2900|to|1900|m/s|sp=us}}. The helium pressurization tank was colder than expected, which reduced the pressure in the fuel tank by about {{Convert|21|kPa|lk=on}}. The reduced pressure caused the engine thrust to be diminished by 2%, but MRO automatically compensated by extending the burn time by 33 seconds.<ref name=\"spaceflightnow1\"/>\n\nCompletion of the orbital insertion placed the orbiter in a highly [[elliptic orbit|elliptical]] polar orbit with a period of approximately 35.5 hours.<ref name=\"New Mars Orbiter Ready for Action\"/> Shortly after insertion, the [[periapsis]] \u2013 the point in the orbit closest to Mars \u2013 was {{Convert|426|km|abbr=on}} from the surface<ref name=\"New Mars Orbiter Ready for Action\"/> ({{Convert|3806|km|abbr=on}} from the planet's center). The [[apoapsis]] \u2013 the point in the orbit farthest from Mars \u2013 was {{Convert|44500|km|abbr=on}} from the surface ({{Convert|47972|km|abbr=on}} from the planet's center).\n\nWhen MRO entered orbit, it joined five other active spacecraft that were either in orbit or on the planet's surface: ''[[Mars Global Surveyor]]'', ''[[Mars Express]]'', ''[[2001 Mars Odyssey]]'', and the two [[Mars Exploration Rover]]s (''[[Spirit (rover)|Spirit]]'' and ''[[Opportunity (rover)|Opportunity]]''). This set a new record for the most operational spacecraft in the immediate vicinity of Mars. ''Mars Global Surveyor'' and the rovers ''Spirit'' and ''Opportunity'' have since ceased to function. {{As of|2019|November|11}} , ''2001 Mars Odyssey'', ''Mars Express'' and MRO remain operational and have been joined by ''[[Mars Orbiter Mission]]'', ''[[MAVEN]]'' and ''[[ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter]]'' in orbit, and ''[[Curiosity (rover)|Curiosity]]'' and ''[[InSight]]'' on the surface, raising the record to eight active spacecraft.\n\n[[File:MRO Aerobrake.jpg|thumb|Artwork of MRO aerobraking]]\nOn March 30, 2006, MRO began the process of [[aerobraking]], a three-step procedure that cuts in half the fuel needed to achieve a lower, more circular orbit with a shorter period. First, during its first five orbits of the planet (one Earth week), MRO used its thrusters to drop the periapsis of its orbit into aerobraking altitude. This altitude depends on the thickness of the [[Atmosphere of Mars|atmosphere]] because Martian atmospheric density changes with its seasons. Second, while using its thrusters to make minor corrections to its periapsis altitude, MRO maintained aerobraking altitude for 445 planetary orbits (about five Earth months) to reduce the apoapsis of the orbit to {{convert|450|km|sp=us}}. This was done in such a way so as to not heat the spacecraft too much, but also dip enough into the atmosphere to slow the spacecraft down. After the process was complete, MRO used its thrusters to move its periapsis out of the edge of the Martian atmosphere on August 30, 2006.<ref name=\"aero\"/><ref name=\"Mars Orbiter Successfully Makes Big Burn\"/>\n\nIn September 2006 MRO fired its thrusters twice more to fine-tune its final, nearly circular orbit to approximately {{Convert|250|to|316|km|abbr=on}} above the Martian surface, with a period of about 112 minutes.<ref name=\"Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Reaches Planned Flight Path\"/><ref name=\"Fact Sheet: HiRISE\"/> The [[SHARAD|SHARAD radar]] antennas were deployed on September 16. All of the scientific instruments were tested and most were turned off prior to the [[solar conjunction]] that occurred from October 7 to November 6, 2006. After the conjunction ended the \"primary science phase\" began.\n\nOn November 17, 2006 NASA announced the successful test of the MRO as an orbital communications relay. Using the NASA rover ''[[Spirit rover|Spirit]]'' as the point of origin for the transmission, the MRO acted as a relay for transmitting data back to Earth.\n\n== Timeline ==\n{{See also|Timeline of the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter}}\n[[File:169384main pia09189-330.jpg|thumb|Tectonic fractures within the [[Candor Chasma]] region of [[Valles Marineris]], [[Mars]], retain ridge-like shapes as the surrounding bedrock erodes away.

This image is said to resolve items as small as 90&nbsp;cm (3&nbsp;feet) in diameter. On October 6, [[NASA]] released detailed pictures from the MRO of [[Victoria crater]] along with the [[Opportunity rover|''Opportunity'' rover]] on the rim above it.<ref name=\"bbc\"/> In November, problems began to surface in the operation of two MRO spacecraft instruments. A stepping mechanism in the Mars Climate Sounder (MCS) skipped on multiple occasions resulting in a field of view that is slightly out of position. By December normal operations of the instrument was suspended, although a mitigation strategy allows the instrument to continue making most of its intended observations.<ref name=\"planetary\"/> Also, an increase in noise and resulting bad [[pixels]] has been observed in several [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]]s of the [[High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment]] (HiRISE). Operation of this camera with a longer warm-up time has alleviated the issue. However, the cause is still unknown and may return.<ref name=\"newscientist\"/>\n\nHiRISE continues to return images that have enabled discoveries regarding the geology of Mars. Foremost among these is the announcement of banded terrain observations indicating the presence and action of liquid [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>) or water on the surface of Mars in its recent geological past. HiRISE was able to photograph the [[Phoenix (spacecraft)|''Phoenix'' lander]] during its parachuted descent to [[Vastitas Borealis]] on May 25, 2008 (sol {{age in sols|2005|08|12|2008|05|25}}).\n\nThe orbiter continued to experience recurring problems in 2009, including four spontaneous resets, culminating in a four-month shut-down of the spacecraft from August to December.<ref name=\"AW\"/> While engineers have not determined the cause of the recurrent resets, they have created new software to help troubleshoot the problem should it recur.\n\nOn March 3, 2010, the ''Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter'' passed another significant milestone, having transmitted over 100 terabits of data back to Earth, which was more than all other interplanetary probes sent from Earth combined.<ref name=\"Scientists wowed by data from Mars probe\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/35698998/ns/technology_and_science-space/t/scientists-wowed-data-mars-probe|title= Scientists Wowed by Data From Mars Probe|accessdate=April 21, 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn August 6, 2012 (sol {{age in sols|2005|08|12|2012|08|06}}), the orbiter passed over [[Gale crater]], the landing site of the [[Mars Science Laboratory]] mission, during its [[Atmospheric entry|EDL]] phase.

The [[Electra (radio)|Electra]] communications package is a [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] [[software-defined radio]] (SDR) that provides a flexible platform for evolving relay capabilities.<ref name=\"Electra\"/> It is designed to communicate with other spacecraft as they approach, land, and operate on Mars. The system consists of a very large ({{convert|3|m|abbr=on}}) antenna, which is used to transmit data through the [[Deep Space Network]] via [[X-band]] frequencies at 8&nbsp;[[Gigahertz|GHz]], and it demonstrates the use of the {{Ka band}} at 32&nbsp;GHz for higher data rates. Maximum transmission speed from Mars is projected to be as high as 6&nbsp;Mbit/s, a rate ten times higher than previous Mars orbiters. The spacecraft carries two 100-watt X-band [[amplifier]]s (one of which is a backup), one 35-watt K<sub>a</sub>-band amplifier, and two [[Small deep space transponder]]s (SDSTs).<ref name=ant/>\n\nTwo smaller low-gain antennas are also present for lower-rate communication during emergencies and special events, such as launch and Mars Orbit Insertion.

They are an important backup system to ensure that MRO can always be reached, even if its main antenna is pointed away from the Earth.<ref name=ant/>\n\nThe K<sub>a</sub>-band subsystem was used for demonstration purposes. Due to lack of spectrum at 8.41&nbsp;GHz X-band, future high-rate deep space missions will use 32&nbsp;GHz K<sub>a</sub>-band. NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) implemented K<sub>a</sub>-band receiving capabilities at all three of its complexes (Goldstone, Canberra and Madrid) over its 34-m beam-waveguide (BWG) antenna subnet. During the cruise phase, spacecraft K<sub>a</sub>-band telemetry was tracked 36 times by these antennas proving functionality at all antennas. K<sub>a</sub>-band tests were also planned during the science phase, but during aerobraking a switch failed, limiting the X-band high gain antenna to a single amplifier.<ref name=\"MRO Waveguide Transfer Switch Anomaly\"/> If this amplifier fails all high-speed X-band communications will be lost.

Two star trackers, [[digital camera]]s used to map the position of catalogued [[star]]s, provide NASA with full, three-axis knowledge of the spacecraft orientation and [[Attitude control|attitude]]. A primary and backup [[Miniature Inertial Measurement Unit (MIMU)]], provided by [[Honeywell]], measures changes to the spacecraft attitude as well as any non-gravitationally induced changes to its linear velocity. Each MIMU is a combination of three [[accelerometer]]s and three ring-laser [[gyroscope]]s. These systems are all critically important to MRO, as it must be able to point its camera to a very high precision in order to take the high-quality pictures that the mission requires. It has also been specifically designed to minimize any vibrations on the spacecraft, so as to allow its instruments to take images without any distortions caused by vibrations.<ref name=\"Spacecraft Parts: Guidance, Navigation, and Control Systems\"/>\n\n== Discoveries and photographs ==\n\n=== Water ice in ice cap measured ===\nResults published in 2009 of radar measurements of the north polar ice cap determined that the volume of water ice in the cap is {{convert|821000|km\u00b3|sp=us}}, equal to 30% of the Earth's Greenland ice sheet.<ref name=\"onorbit\"/>\n\n=== Ice exposed in new craters ===\n[[File:Ice exposed by impact.jpg|thumb|Water ice excavated by an impact crater that formed between January and September 2008. The ice was identified spectroscopically using CRISM.]]\nAn article in the journal ''Science'' in September 2009,<ref name=\"distribution\"/> reported that some new craters on Mars have excavated relatively pure water ice. After being exposed, the ice gradually fades as it sublimates away. These new craters were found and dated by the CTX camera, and the identification of the ice was confirmed with the Compact Imaging Spectrometer (CRISM) on board the ''Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter''. The ice was found in a total of five locations. Three of the locations are in the [[Cebrenia quadrangle]]. These locations are {{coord|55.57|N|150.62|E|globe:mars}}; {{coord|43.28|N|176.9|E|globe:mars}}; and {{coord|45|N|164.5|E|globe:mars}}. Two others are in the [[Diacria quadrangle]]: {{coord|46.7|N|176.8|E|globe:mars}} and {{coord|46.33|N|176.9|E|globe:mars}}.<ref name=\"Water Ice Exposed in Mars Craters\"/><ref name=\"NASA to Hold Teleconference to Discuss New Findings About Mars\"/>\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=\"190px\" heights=\"180px\">\nIceincraterscomparison.jpg|Two pictures from HiRISE showing how ice disappeared over time in a crater. The crater on the left is before ice disappeared. The crater is 6 meters in diameter and located in [[Cebrenia quadrangle]]..\n</gallery>\n\n=== Ice in lobate debris aprons ===\n[[File:Lobate Debris Apron in Phlegra Montes.JPG|thumb|[[Lobate debris apron]] in [[Phlegra Montes]], [[Cebrenia quadrangle]]. The debris apron is probably mostly ice with a thin covering of rock debris, so it could be a source of water for future Martian colonists. Scale bar is {{convert|500|m|abbr=on}}.]]\nRadar results from [[SHARAD]] suggested that features termed [[lobate debris apron]]s (LDAs) contain large amounts of water ice. Of interest from the days of the [[Viking]] Orbiters, these LDA are aprons of material surrounding cliffs. They have a convex topography and a gentle slope; this suggests flow away from the steep source cliff. In addition, lobate debris aprons can show surface lineations just as rock glaciers on the Earth.<ref>{{cite news |title=NASA Spacecraft Detects Buried Glaciers on Mars |url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=1957 |work=NASA/JPL |date=November 20, 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"Kieffer1992\"/> [[SHARAD]] has provided strong evidence that the LDAs in [[Hellas Planitia]] are [[glacier]]s that are covered with a thin layer of debris (i.e. rocks and dust); a strong reflection from the top and base of LDAs was observed, suggesting that pure water ice makes up the bulk of the formation (between the two reflections).<ref name=\"brown\"/> Based on the experiments of the [[Phoenix lander|''Phoenix'' lander]] and the studies of the [[Mars Odyssey]] from orbit, water ice is known to exist just under the surface of Mars in the far north and south (high latitudes).\n\n=== Chloride deposits ===\n[[File:Chloride deposits on Mars.JPG|thumb|Chloride deposits in Terra Sirenum]]\nUsing data from Mars Global Surveyor, Mars Odyssey and the ''Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter'', scientists have found widespread deposits of chloride minerals. Evidence suggests that the deposits were formed from the evaporation of mineral enriched waters. The research suggests that lakes may have been scattered over large areas of the Martian surface. Usually chlorides are the last minerals to come out of solution. Carbonates, sulfates, and silica should precipitate out ahead of them. Sulfates and silica have been found by the Mars rovers on the surface. Places with chloride minerals may have once held various life forms. Furthermore, such areas could preserve traces of ancient life.<ref name=\"materials\"/>\n\n=== Other aqueous minerals ===\nIn 2009, a group of scientists from the CRISM team reported on 9 to 10 different classes of minerals formed in the presence of water. Different types of [[clays]] (also called phyllosilicates) were found in many locations. The physilicates identified included aluminum smectite, iron/magnesium smectite, [[kaolinite]], [[prehnite]], and [[Chlorite group|chlorite]]. Rocks containing carbonate were found around the [[Isidis basin]]. [[Carbonates]] belong to one class in which life could have developed. Areas around [[Valles Marineris]] were found to contain hydrated [[silica]] and hydrated sulfates. The researchers identified hydrated sulfates and ferric minerals in [[Terra Meridiani]] and in [[Valles Marineris]]. Other minerals found on Mars were [[jarosite]], [[alunite]], [[hematite]], [[opal]], and [[gypsum]]. Two to five of the mineral classes were formed with the right [[pH]] and sufficient water to permit life to grow.<ref name=\"reconnaissance\"/>\n\n=== Avalanches ===\nThe ''Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter'' CTX and HiRISE cameras have photographed a number of avalanches off the scarps of the northern polar cap as they were occurring.<ref name=\"2008gl035790\"/>\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=\"190px\" heights=\"180px\">\nFour Martian avalanches, 2008.jpg|Martian avalanche and debris falls (HiRISE 2008)\nMars Avalanche with Scale.jpg |A photo with scale demonstrates the size of the avalanche.\n</gallery>\n\n=== Other spacecraft ===\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=\"190px\" heights=\"180px\">\nDescent of Phoenix with a crater in the background taken by Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.jpg|Image of ''[[Phoenix (spacecraft)|Phoenix]]'' landing on Mars, as seen by HiRISE.
