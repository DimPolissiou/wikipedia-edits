The station is currently owned by [[HC2 Holdings]]. Previously, the station had been licensed to [[Sheboygan, Wisconsin]] until 2011, and was an owned and operated [[broadcast translator|translator station]] via satellite of the [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]] since sign-on in 1990<ref>http://www.northpine.com/broadcast/archive/news0407.html</ref>  as '''W16BS'''. Currently, the station has a pending [[construction permit]] for a digital transmitter on channel 9.\n\n==Station history in Sheboygan==\nFor seventeen years, the station acted as the local translator station for TBN, first transmitting from the downtown Firstar Building on channel 20 as '''W20AG'''. The station then moved to a new transmitting facility around 1999 on Sheboygan's south side along Weeden Creek Road ([[County Trunk Highways (Wisconsin)|CTH]] EE), in an [[industrial park]] just west of a [[Wisconsin Department of Transportation|WisDOT]] [[emissions testing]] station on land leased from [[Lakeshore Technical College]] (which formerly broadcast their college bulletin board channel '''W08BW''' with a [[Satellite Communications for Learning|SCOLA]] affiliation on channel 8 from the site until the early 2000s). The next year the station would move to channel 16 as '''W16BS''', continuing to transmit the TBN schedule without local deviation.\n\nSeveral factors influenced the sale of the station, including a declining audience via antenna for TBN's translator stations, and the signals of religious stations [[WTLJ]] and [[WLLA]] from Western Michigan being easily receivable during the summer months in the Sheboygan area. \n\nThe launch by TBN of [[WWRS-TV|WWRS]] from [[Mayville, Wisconsin|Mayville]] did not affect W16BS as that station's signal was blocked by the [[Kettle Moraine]] range east of Fond du Lac, blocking any signal from entering Sheboygan and leaving TBN to continue to operate W16BS. However TBN and its other digital subchannels later launched on local cable provider [[Charter Communications]] in late August 2007, with reception via satellite.<ref>http://www.madison.com/wsj/home/biz/index.php?ntid=202840&ntpid=1</ref> [[Time Warner Cable]] systems in the county also carry the network via WWRS via [[must-carry]] election. These carriage agreements, associated costs of the digital transition, and universal coverage by the major satellite broadcasters were likely the impetus for TBN's sale of the station to another party.\n\nThe station was taken [[Dark (broadcasting)|silent]] after TBN sold the station to [[Sarasota, Florida]]-based Sheboygan Community Broadcasting, LLC in August 2007, which was likely a [[holding company]] designed solely to profit from a sale of the station's license without a commitment to broadcast (notably, the FCC application misspelled the city of license in the above LLC as \"Sheboygen\"). \n\nFCC records indicate that the station returned to the air on channel 29 as '''W29DJ''' on March 6, 2008, but from a different transmitter located south of [[Random Lake, Wisconsin|Random Lake]] east of [[Wisconsin Highway 57|Highway 57]], which does not actually cover Sheboygan, and instead broadcasts to communities in southeast Sheboygan County and northeast Ozaukee County. Service from Random Lake has been intermittent however as SCB's transmitter equipment was leased from another party and it was seized several times for non-payment before the sale to Polnet. As of May 2011 the station, if it is broadcasting from Random Lake, is broadcasting only to a four square mile area southeast of Random Lake only covering several farms<ref>http://www.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/FMTV-service-area?x=TX1335451.html</ref>  to maintain service and the license.\n\nA return to Sheboygan became unlikely around July 2008, when the tower, transmitter, and TBN's satellite equipment was removed from the Weeden Creek Road site after LTC ended their lease with the city of Sheboygan for the land within the industrial park, leaving only the transmitter shed remaining for storage.\n\nThe station previously covered the eastern part of [[Sheboygan County, Wisconsin|Sheboygan County]], with the original footprint of the digital signal from Sheboygan expected to fully cover the county, southern [[Manitowoc County, Wisconsin|Manitowoc County]] and northern [[Ozaukee County, Wisconsin|Ozaukee County]].\n\n==Station history in Milwaukee==\nAccording to FCC records, Sheboygan Community Broadcasting sold the station on November 23, 2009 to Polnet Communications, which provides ethnic programming in [[Polish language|Polish]] and other languages and owns several ethnic radio stations in the Chicago area, and formerly had a time-lease arrangement for Polish language television programming on [[WCIU-TV|WCIU-DT6]] in Chicago before launching their own station in the area in 2010, [[WPVN-CD|WPVN-CA]] (Channel 24). Polnet plan to air \"quality ethnic programming\", according to their FCC statements. \n\nA construction permit for channel 36 from the [[Milwaukee PBS|Milwaukee PBS Tower]] in Milwaukee was contested by Milwaukee PBS (then branded as MPTV) itself, which asserted their existing analog rights from [[WMVT]] being on analog channel 36 to place a digital translator station for [[WMVS]] there to address inefficiencies with WMVS's digital channel 8 signal in Milwaukee proper. Polnet subsequently withdrew the application for 36 and petitioned for a digital application on channel 30 in early December 2009, also from the Milwaukee PBS Tower. The placement of the station's transmitter in Milwaukee likely meant that Polnet did not intend to keep any kind of service to Sheboygan, and the placement of the analog tower in Random Lake was solely intended to \"skip\" the station down to Milwaukee, a move allowed under FCC regulations.\n\nOn April 9, 2010, the station was reclassified as a [[LPTV|low power television station]], and took the lettered calls WPVS-LP. On January 3, 2011, the FCC authorized the change of city of license from Sheboygan to Milwaukee<ref>http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/sta_det.pl?Facility_id=67976</ref>  with a license expiration of December 2013. Currently the station's license expires on December 1, 2021; it has continued to operate under 'silent and licensed' authority from the FCC, with occasional operation from the rented Random Lake site to maintain the license while it looks to permanently operate from the Milwaukee PBS Tower.\n\nOn July 31, 2018, [[HC2 Holdings]] announced it would purchase WPVS-LP for $400,000, and in the interim a new construction permit for [[very high frequency|VHF]] channel 9 from the Milwaukee PBS tower has been filed (HC2 had filed a purchase agreement for WPVN in Chicago two months before<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rbr.com/polnet-hc2-azteca-chic/|title=Windy City LPTV Secured For Azteca Owner|last=Jacobson|first=Adam|date=5 June 2018|work=Radio & Television Business Report|accessdate=12 September 2018}}</ref>).

Do not place a period at the end of the entry. Names are reported under the date of death. Names under each date are reported in alphabetical order by surname or pseudonym.\n\n(1) Please add only those meeting Wikipedia notability guidelines. Include a reference to a reliable source.[a] [b] If a Wikipedia article for the dead does not yet exist, reconsider whether the subject is actually notable. If so, consider writing an article yourself. Those without a Wikipedia article are removed after one month.\n\n(2) Please understand that the intent of this article is to report notable deaths. Tragic deaths, while unfortunate, do not necessarily render the dead \"notable\". If you report the death of a notable subject that does not already have a Wikipedia article, consider starting one. Include third-party sources other than the obituary.\n\n(3) Please add entries in alphabetical order by family name. Please avoid over-linking. As such, please do not add links to nationalities, common occupations, or common causes of death. Rather, include only \"links that aid navigation and understanding\". Thank you.\n\n(4) References should be in <ref>[url & title]</ref> format, as full citations make the page too slow to load, and too big to edit.\n\n--Notes--\n[a] See [[WP:RS]] for definition of
