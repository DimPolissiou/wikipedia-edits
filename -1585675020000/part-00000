Before the [[Second World War]], the current town was a farming village with not quite 4,000 inhabitants. However, after the war, there was a considerable upswing in the population due to refugees settling in the community. From the 1970s onwards, Dietzenbach's population rose rapidly, reaching some 33,000 by 2006. Just under a third of the inhabitants have roots in more than a hundred nations outside Germany. Agricultural buildings are nowadays seldom seen in Dietzenbach.\n\nIn 2001, Dietzenbach hosted the 41st [[Hessentag]] state festival.\n\n== Geography ==\n\n=== Neighbouring communities ===\nDietzenbach borders in the north on the town of [[Heusenstamm]], in the east on the town of [[Rodgau]], in the south on the town of [[R\u00f6dermark]] and in the west on the town of [[Dreieich]].\n\n=== Constituent communities ===\nThe town of Dietzenbach is made up of a number of ''[[Ortsteil|Stadtteile]]'', although not all places listed here have this official designation.\n\n==== Steinberg ====\nSteinberg is a constituent community. Parts of the north industrial area are found here, as well as daycare centres (''Kindertagesst\u00e4tten'') 3,5 and 11, the Siedlerstra\u00dfe Seniors\u2019 Centre and four schools: ''Astrid-Lindgren-Schule'' ([[primary school]]), ''Regenbogenschule'' (primary school), ''Helen-Keller-Schule'' (special school) and ''Heinrich-Mann-Schule'' (co\u00f6perative [[comprehensive school]] with [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] upper level). Furthermore, there is a sporting ground on Limesstra\u00dfe. In the centre is the Steinberg Shopping Centre. Just under 12,000 people live in Steinberg.\n\n==== Neue Stadtmitte ====\nBetween Steinberg and the old town centre, a new building area has sprung up over the years, in whose centre the town administration and Dietzenbach's community centre have settled. It is known as the ''Neue Stadtmitte'' \u2013 the New Town Centre.\n\nBefore this, the most prominent feature was a [[shopping centre]] with a big [[supermarket]], filling station and carpark, which the locals over time came to see as an [[eyesore]] for its rather unappealing 1970s architecture and the company's neglect of the building.\n\nSales dealings kept delaying any new development. Finally, in late 2005, agreements between the town and the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] Ten Brinke Group were signed.\n\nAfter the old toom<!--That\u2019s meant to be in lowercase; don\u2019t change it.--> Markt closed in mid-2005, the whole building complex was torn down in autumn 2006 to make way for a new shopping centre. The foundation stone was laid on 4 December 2006, and on 29 November 2007, the shopping centre opened, and was given the name ''Rathaus-Center''.\n\nThe Ten Brinke Group, the \u20ac37,500,000 project's investor, built a 230&nbsp;m-long and 101&nbsp;m broad building in which are found, on 8&nbsp;000&nbsp;m\u00b2 a toom Markt, and on 4&nbsp;000&nbsp;m\u00b2 a [[Media Markt|Media-Markt]]. The rest of the 21&nbsp;000&nbsp;m\u00b2 is shared among [[C&A]] (1&nbsp;600&nbsp;m\u00b2), [[Heinrich Deichmann-Schuhe GmbH|Deichmann]] (two units of 500&nbsp;m\u00b2 each), the clothing chain Ernsting's Family (200&nbsp;m\u00b2), other shops and various catering businesses.\n\n==== Hexenberg ====\nHexenberg, whose name is [[German language|German]] for \u201cWitches\u2019 Mountain\u201d, is a constituent community. It is named after the highest elevation in Offenbach district. The buildings are mostly relatively low one-family and multiple-family dwellings as well as a few smaller shops in the middle of the community.\n\n==== Wingertsberg ====\nWingertsberg (called '''''der''' Wingertsberg'' in German) is not a constituent community as such, but rather a residential neighbourhood lying on a slope across from the Old Town. At the upper end of the neighbourhood are found, besides a sporting ground, a restaurant with a viewing terrace and the lookout tower built for the ''Hessentag'' state festival, from which it is possible to see Frankfurt.\n\n==== Altstadt ====\nIn Dietzenbach\u2019s Old Town, many [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses have been preserved. Besides these, the Old Town is where the local history museum, the town library and the police station are to be found.\n\n==== Spessartviertel (formerly Starkenburgring) ====\nThis constituent community, which borders right on the Old Town, is a neighbourhood built up with nothing but highrises. Originally planned as an upscale neighbourhood, social problems and the crime arising therefrom have brought the town and the surrounding area greater challenges than ever. Today, roughly 90% of the inhabitants have an immigration background. Most come from Turkey, Morocco, Afghanistan, Pakistan or various African countries.<!--This is queried on de:WP (\u201cQuelle ??\u201d), perhaps because one editor thought it was an anti-immigrant rant. Keep watching.-->\n\n==== Climate ====\nThe whole city and the surrounding cities and villages experience a dominant [[Seasonal tropical forest|seasonal tropical forest climate]]. Daily in the afternoon, there's a one-hour monsoon-like rainfall. The number of sunshine hours is high, and the annual temperature is at around 72 degrees Fahrenheit (22 degrees Celsius). This [[Tropical climate|climate]] is still very rare in Hesse and establishes itself by a free self-rearrangement of nature.\n\nThe vegetation is similar to the rest of Germany. Dietzenbach is surrounded by cozy [[Ancient and Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians and Other Regions of Europe|beech forests]], which cover about 42% of the state of Hesse, making it the greenest state in Germany. The forests and rangelands are home to several [[Flora and fauna of Germany|midwest-European animal and mixed plant species]]. One of them is the apple tree, which is used to produce the regional famous [[Apfelwein|Hessian apple wine or cider]], as well as the wine grape, from which local [[wine]] is made by. The grape has a long traditional meaning in Dietzenbach and is therefore also seen on the coat of arms of the city. Besides that, [[Tropical vegetation|tropical plants]] can be found in the whole regions throughout the climate area. Therefore in many gardens [[Arecaceae|palm trees]], [[Banana|banana trees]], [[citrus]] fruits, [[Coffea|coffee]], and many other plants from all over the world can be found growing.\n{{Weather box|location=Dietzenbach 2020-present, extremes 2019\u2013present|16h-17h precipitation mm=53.0|14h-15h rain days=14.0|12h-13h rain days=14.0|10h-11h rain days=15.0|08h-09h rain days=15.0|06h-07h rain days=14.0|04h-05h rain days=14.0|02h-03h rain days=13.0|00h-01h rain days=16.0|24h precipitation mm=629.18|22h-23h precipitation mm=53.9|20h-21h precipitation mm=49.1|18h-19h precipitation mm=54.7|Aug precipitation mm=56.5|18h-19h rain days=12.0|Jul precipitation mm=64.7|10h-11h precipitation mm=58.1|08h-09h precipitation mm=63.4|06h-07h precipitation mm=42.1|04h-05h precipitation mm=48.4|02h-03h precipitation mm=40.9|00h-01h precipitation mm=44.5|precipitation colour=green|24h record low C=|22h-23h record low C=-17.0|20h-21h record low C=-11.5|Oct record low C=-6.3|Sep rain days=12.0|Nov rain days=14.0|Aug record low C=2.5|Feb percentsun=29|date=January 2013|source 1=Data derived from [[Deutscher Wetterdienst]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dwd.de/bvbw/appmanager/bvbw/dwdwwwDesktop?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=_dwdwww_klima_umwelt_klimadaten_deutschland&T82002gsbDocumentPath=Navigation%2FOeffentlichkeit%2FKlima__Umwelt%2FKlimadaten%2Fkldaten__kostenfrei%2Fausgabe__monatswerte__node.html%3F__nnn%3 |title=Ausgabe der Klimadaten: Monatswerte |accessdate= }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>|Dec percentsun=16|Nov percentsun=19|Oct percentsun=30|Sep percentsun=40|Aug percentsun=51|Jul percentsun=47|Jun percentsun=46|May percentsun=45|Apr percentsun=42|Mar percentsun=33|Jan percentsun=18|Dec rain days=16.0|year sun=1662|Dec sun=41|Nov sun=51|Oct sun=103|Sep sun=156|Aug sun=219|Jul sun=233|Jun sun=219|May sun=211|Apr sun=178|Mar sun=121|Feb sun=80|Jan sun=50|Sep record low C=-0.3|Jul record low C=2.8|metric first=Yes|Jan high C=4.2|year high C=14.8|Dec high C=4.9|Nov high C=8.4|Oct high C=14.6|Sep high C=20.3|Aug high C=25.1|Jul high C=25.5|Jun high C=23.1|May high C=20.0|Apr high C=15.4|Mar high C=10.7|Feb high C=5.9|year record high C=|Feb mean C=2.4|Dec record high C=16.3|Nov record high C=19.1|Oct record high C=28.0|Sep record high C=32.8|Aug record high C=38.7|Jul record high C=40.2|Jun record high C=39.3|May record high C=33.2|Apr record high C=30.3|Mar record high C=24.7|Feb record high C=19.1|Jan record high C=15.9|single line=Yes|Jan mean C=1.6|Mar mean C=6.4|Jun record low C=0.1|Jun low C=12.3|May record low C=-2.8|Apr record low C=-7.1|Mar record low C=-13.0|Feb record low C=-19.6|Jan record low C=-21.6|year low C=6.2|Dec low C=-0.1|Nov low C=2.8|Oct low C=6.6|Sep low C=10.5|Aug low C=14.0|Jul low C=14.4|May low C=9.1|Apr mean C=10.3|Apr low C=4.9|Mar low C=2.1|Feb low C=-1.1|Jan low C=-1.1|year mean C=10.6|Dec mean C=2.5|Nov mean C=5.6|Oct mean C=10.4|Sep mean C=15.2|Aug mean C=19.5|Jul mean C=20.0|Jun mean C=17.8|May mean C=14.7|source 2=Weather Atlas (sunshine data)<ref name=\"Weather Atlas\">{{cite web |url=https://www.weather-atlas.com/en/germany/frankfurt-climate |title=Frankfurt, Germany \u2013 Climate data |publisher=Weather Atlas |access-date=15 April 2017 }}</ref>}}\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\" style=\"width:100%;text-align:center;line-height:1.2em;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\"\n!

The later forsaken settlements of Ippingshausen and Richolshausen lay within what are now Dietzenbach\u2019s limits in the Early [[Middle Ages]].\n\nIn 1545, the Counts of [[Hanau]], who had been Dietzenbach\u2019s lords for a few centuries, introduced [[Protestantism]]. When the Counts of Hanau died out in 1736, the Landgraves [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt|Hesse-Darmstadt]] and of [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]] fought over who had the right to be Dietzenbach\u2019s lords.\n\nThe ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' of [[Schaafheim]], with Dietzenbach, which lay within it, passed in 1773 to Hesse-Darmstadt. With the partition of the [[R\u00f6dermark]] in 1818, the community acquired its forest. In 1821, the ''Amt'' of Schaafheim was dissolved and Dietzenbach passed to the ''Landratsbezirk'' of [[Langen, Hesse|Langen]]. However, by 1832 Dietzenbach had already been assigned to the district of Offenbach.\n\nIn 1898, the [[railway]] through [[Offenbach am Main|Offenbach]], Bieber and Heusenstamm to Dietzenbach was dedicated and the [[railway station]] was built, which is now once again in use, after many years of seeing no passenger service at all, by the [[Rhine-Main S-Bahn]]. The line underwent an extensive modernization for S-Bahn operation.\n\nA British air raid in 1941 caused great damage in the community.\n\nDietzenbach was granted town rights in 1971. Since 2002, Dietzenbach has also been administrative seat of the district of Offenbach. However, it was only officially allowed to use the designation ''Kreisstadt'' (\u201cDistrict Seat\u201d) beginning in March 2003 as the result of a dispute with the neighbouring town of Rodgau, which had demanded this status on the grounds that it had a greater population.\n\n== Population development ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  align=\"right\"\n! class=\"hintergrundfarbe6\" | Year\n! class=\"hintergrundfarbe6\" | Inhabitants\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|2009\n| align=right valign=top|33,224\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|2007\n| align=right valign=top|34,773\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|2005\n| align=right valign=top|34,794\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1997\n| align=right valign=top|33,015\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1983\n| align=right valign=top|25,500\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1970\n| align=right valign=top|12,449\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1961\n| align=right valign=top|6,303\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1950\n| align=right valign=top|4,711\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1939\n| align=right valign=top|3,695\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1834\n| align=right valign=top|3,695\n|-\n|}\nIn 1834, Dietzenbach had 3,695 inhabitants. One hundred and five years later, in 1939, it was 3,695. After the [[Second World War]] ended, 4,711 people lived in the community in 1950. In 1961, this had risen to 6,303. After extensive new development had been undertaken in the 1960s, the town\u2019s population in 1970 was 12,449. In 1983 it was 25,500 and in 1997 33,015, 30% of whom held citizenship other than German.\n\nDietzenbach has one of the highest birthrates in the state (1990: ~380, 2006: 420 births).<ref>Frankfurter Rundschau: [http://www.fr-online.de/frankfurt_und_hessen/nachrichten/offenbach/?em_cnt=1262983 Die Kinderlein kommen]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

The blue wavy fess refers to the town\u2019s name, interpreted as being from the [[Old High German]] for \u201cbabbling brook\u201d or \u201cBrook of Dietz\u201d (compare here ''775 Jahre Dietzenbach'', published by Dietzenbach town executive). The town\u2019s current arms were determined by Dietzenbach\u2019s community councillors in 1957 and approved by the then Hessian Interior Minister Schneider.\n\nDietzenbach\u2019s flag consists of two narrower blue bands framing the broader yellow band in the middle, upon which appear the town\u2019s arms.\n\n== Transport ==\n[[File:Dietzenbach Bahnhof 20070912-2.jpg|thumb|[[Dietzenbach station]]]]\nSince late 2003, Dietzenbach is connected as the end-station with the [[S-train|suburban metropolitan network]] Frankfurt.[[Dietzenbach station|Dietzenbach]], [[Dietzenbach-Mitte station|Dietzenbach-Mitte]] and [[Dietzenbach-Steinberg station|Dietzenbach-Steinberg]] stations have been served by the [[Rhine-Main S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] [[S2 (Rhine-Main S-Bahn)|Line 2 (S2)]], which runs on the [[Niedernhausen station|Niedernhausen]] \u2013 [[Hofheim station|Hofheim]] \u2013 [[Frankfurt Central underground station|Frankfurt]] \u2013 [[Offenbach (Main) Ost station|Offenbach]] \u2013 Dietzenbach route.

Before the [[Second World War]], the current town was a farming village with not quite 4,000 inhabitants. However, after the war, there was a considerable upswing in the population due to refugees settling in the community. From the 1970s onwards, Dietzenbach's population rose rapidly, reaching some 33,000 by 2006. Just under a third of the inhabitants have roots in more than a hundred nations outside Germany. Agricultural buildings are nowadays seldom seen in Dietzenbach.\n\nIn 2001, Dietzenbach hosted the 41st [[Hessentag]] state festival.\n\n== Geography ==\n\n=== Neighbouring communities ===\nDietzenbach borders in the north on the town of [[Heusenstamm]], in the east on the town of [[Rodgau]], in the south on the town of [[R\u00f6dermark]] and in the west on the town of [[Dreieich]].\n\n=== Constituent communities ===\nThe town of Dietzenbach is made up of a number of ''[[Ortsteil|Stadtteile]]'', although not all places listed here have this official designation.\n\n==== Steinberg ====\nSteinberg is a constituent community. Parts of the north industrial area are found here, as well as daycare centres (''Kindertagesst\u00e4tten'') 3,5 and 11, the Siedlerstra\u00dfe Seniors\u2019 Centre and four schools: ''Astrid-Lindgren-Schule'' ([[primary school]]), ''Regenbogenschule'' (primary school), ''Helen-Keller-Schule'' (special school) and ''Heinrich-Mann-Schule'' (co\u00f6perative [[comprehensive school]] with [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] upper level). Furthermore, there is a sporting ground on Limesstra\u00dfe. In the centre is the Steinberg Shopping Centre. Just under 12,000 people live in Steinberg.\n\n==== Neue Stadtmitte ====\nBetween Steinberg and the old town centre, a new building area has sprung up over the years, in whose centre the town administration and Dietzenbach's community centre have settled. It is known as the ''Neue Stadtmitte'' \u2013 the New Town Centre.\n\nBefore this, the most prominent feature was a [[shopping centre]] with a big [[supermarket]], filling station and carpark, which the locals over time came to see as an [[eyesore]] for its rather unappealing 1970s architecture and the company's neglect of the building.\n\nSales dealings kept delaying any new development. Finally, in late 2005, agreements between the town and the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] Ten Brinke Group were signed.\n\nAfter the old toom<!--That\u2019s meant to be in lowercase; don\u2019t change it.--> Markt closed in mid-2005, the whole building complex was torn down in autumn 2006 to make way for a new shopping centre. The foundation stone was laid on 4 December 2006, and on 29 November 2007, the shopping centre opened, and was given the name ''Rathaus-Center''.\n\nThe Ten Brinke Group, the \u20ac37,500,000 project's investor, built a 230&nbsp;m-long and 101&nbsp;m broad building in which are found, on 8&nbsp;000&nbsp;m\u00b2 a toom Markt, and on 4&nbsp;000&nbsp;m\u00b2 a [[Media Markt|Media-Markt]]. The rest of the 21&nbsp;000&nbsp;m\u00b2 is shared among [[C&A]] (1&nbsp;600&nbsp;m\u00b2), [[Heinrich Deichmann-Schuhe GmbH|Deichmann]] (two units of 500&nbsp;m\u00b2 each), the clothing chain Ernsting's Family (200&nbsp;m\u00b2), other shops and various catering businesses.\n\n==== Hexenberg ====\nHexenberg, whose name is [[German language|German]] for \u201cWitches\u2019 Mountain\u201d, is a constituent community. It is named after the highest elevation in Offenbach district. The buildings are mostly relatively low one-family and multiple-family dwellings as well as a few smaller shops in the middle of the community.\n\n==== Wingertsberg ====\nWingertsberg (called '''''der''' Wingertsberg'' in German) is not a constituent community as such, but rather a residential neighbourhood lying on a slope across from the Old Town. At the upper end of the neighbourhood are found, besides a sporting ground, a restaurant with a viewing terrace and the lookout tower built for the ''Hessentag'' state festival, from which it is possible to see Frankfurt.\n\n==== Altstadt ====\nIn Dietzenbach\u2019s Old Town, many [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses have been preserved. Besides these, the Old Town is where the local history museum, the town library and the police station are to be found.\n\n==== Spessartviertel (formerly Starkenburgring) ====\nThis constituent community, which borders right on the Old Town, is a neighbourhood built up with nothing but highrises. Originally planned as an upscale neighbourhood, social problems and the crime arising therefrom have brought the town and the surrounding area greater challenges than ever. Today, roughly 90% of the inhabitants have an immigration background. Most come from Turkey, Morocco, Afghanistan, Pakistan or various African countries.<!--This is queried on de:WP (\u201cQuelle ??\u201d), perhaps because one editor thought it was an anti-immigrant rant. Keep watching.-->\n\n==== Climate ====\nThe whole city and the surrounding cities and villages experience a dominant [[Seasonal tropical forest|seasonal tropical forest climate]]. Daily in the afternoon, there's a one-hour monsoon-like rainfall. The number of sunshine hours is high, and the annual temperature is at around 72 degrees Fahrenheit (22 degrees Celsius). This [[Tropical climate|climate]] is still very rare in Hesse and establishes itself by a free self-rearrangement of nature.\n\nThe vegetation is similar to the rest of Germany. Dietzenbach is surrounded by cozy [[Ancient and Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians and Other Regions of Europe|beech forests]], which cover about 42% of the state of Hesse, making it the greenest state in Germany. The forests and rangelands are home to several [[Flora and fauna of Germany|midwest-European animal and mixed plant species]]. One of them is the apple tree, which is used to produce the regional famous [[Apfelwein|Hessian apple wine or cider]], as well as the wine grape, from which local [[wine]] is made by. The grape has a long traditional meaning in Dietzenbach and is therefore also seen on the coat of arms of the city. Besides that, [[Tropical vegetation|tropical plants]] can be found in the whole regions throughout the climate area. Therefore in many gardens [[Arecaceae|palm trees]], [[Banana|banana trees]], [[citrus]] fruits, [[Coffea|coffee]], and many other plants from all over the world can be found growing.\n\n== History ==\nDietzenbach had its first documentary mention about 1210 in a donation document to the Patershausen monastery as ''Dicenbah''. The later forsaken settlements of Ippingshausen and Richolshausen lay within what are now Dietzenbach\u2019s limits in the Early [[Middle Ages]].\n\nIn 1545, the Counts of [[Hanau]], who had been Dietzenbach\u2019s lords for a few centuries, introduced [[Protestantism]]. When the Counts of Hanau died out in 1736, the Landgraves [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt|Hesse-Darmstadt]] and of [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]] fought over who had the right to be Dietzenbach\u2019s lords.\n\nThe ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' of [[Schaafheim]], with Dietzenbach, which lay within it, passed in 1773 to Hesse-Darmstadt. With the partition of the [[R\u00f6dermark]] in 1818, the community acquired its forest. In 1821, the ''Amt'' of Schaafheim was dissolved and Dietzenbach passed to the ''Landratsbezirk'' of [[Langen, Hesse|Langen]]. However, by 1832 Dietzenbach had already been assigned to the district of Offenbach.\n\nIn 1898, the [[railway]] through [[Offenbach am Main|Offenbach]], Bieber and Heusenstamm to Dietzenbach was dedicated and the [[railway station]] was built, which is now once again in use, after many years of seeing no passenger service at all, by the [[Rhine-Main S-Bahn]]. The line underwent an extensive modernization for S-Bahn operation.\n\nA British air raid in 1941 caused great damage in the community.\n\nDietzenbach was granted town rights in 1971. Since 2002, Dietzenbach has also been administrative seat of the district of Offenbach. However, it was only officially allowed to use the designation ''Kreisstadt'' (\u201cDistrict Seat\u201d) beginning in March 2003 as the result of a dispute with the neighbouring town of Rodgau, which had demanded this status on the grounds that it had a greater population.\n\n== Population development ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  align=\"right\"\n! class=\"hintergrundfarbe6\" | Year\n! class=\"hintergrundfarbe6\" | Inhabitants\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|2009\n| align=right valign=top|33,224\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|2007\n| align=right valign=top|34,773\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|2005\n| align=right valign=top|34,794\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1997\n| align=right valign=top|33,015\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1983\n| align=right valign=top|25,500\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1970\n| align=right valign=top|12,449\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1961\n| align=right valign=top|6,303\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1950\n| align=right valign=top|4,711\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1939\n| align=right valign=top|3,695\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1834\n| align=right valign=top|3,695\n|-\n|}\nIn 1834, Dietzenbach had 3,695 inhabitants. One hundred and five years later, in 1939, it was 3,695. After the [[Second World War]] ended, 4,711 people lived in the community in 1950. In 1961, this had risen to 6,303. After extensive new development had been undertaken in the 1960s, the town\u2019s population in 1970 was 12,449. In 1983 it was 25,500 and in 1997 33,015, 30% of whom held citizenship other than German.\n\nDietzenbach has one of the highest birthrates in the state (1990: ~380, 2006: 420 births).<ref>Frankfurter Rundschau: [http://www.fr-online.de/frankfurt_und_hessen/nachrichten/offenbach/?em_cnt=1262983 Die Kinderlein kommen]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

As with town council itself, there is a foreigners\u2019 advisory council session, which takes place a fortnight before the town council session.\n\nThe current chairman is since November 2015 Cengiz Hendek.\n\n=== Coat of arms and flag ===\nThe town\u2019s [[Coat of arms|arms]] might be described thus: Gules a bend argent surmounted by a bend wavy azure, the whole between two bunches of grapes Or, each with two leaves vert.\n\nThe grapes refer to the town\u2019s winegrowing tradition, which came to an end in the 18th century but was revived in the 1960s on the Wingertsberg. The blue wavy fess refers to the town\u2019s name, interpreted as being from the [[Old High German]] for \u201cbabbling brook\u201d or \u201cBrook of Dietz\u201d (compare here ''775 Jahre Dietzenbach'', published by Dietzenbach town executive). The town\u2019s current arms were determined by Dietzenbach\u2019s community councillors in 1957 and approved by the then Hessian Interior Minister Schneider.\n\nDietzenbach\u2019s flag consists of two narrower blue bands framing the broader yellow band in the middle, upon which appear the town\u2019s arms.\n\n== Transport ==\n[[File:Dietzenbach Bahnhof 20070912-2.jpg|thumb|[[Dietzenbach station]]]]\nSince late 2003, Dietzenbach is connected as the end-station with the [[S-train|suburban metropolitan network]] Frankfurt.[[Dietzenbach station|Dietzenbach]], [[Dietzenbach-Mitte station|Dietzenbach-Mitte]] and [[Dietzenbach-Steinberg station|Dietzenbach-Steinberg]] stations have been served by the [[Rhine-Main S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] [[S2 (Rhine-Main S-Bahn)|Line 2 (S2)]], which runs on the [[Niedernhausen station|Niedernhausen]] \u2013 [[Hofheim station|Hofheim]] \u2013 [[Frankfurt Central underground station|Frankfurt]] \u2013 [[Offenbach (Main) Ost station|Offenbach]] \u2013 Dietzenbach route.

The reverse of the banknote featured a depiction of the Philippine declaration of independence by Emilio Aguinaldo on June 12, 1898.\n\nSecurity features of the banknote included a security thread, scattered red & blue visible fibers, and fluorescent printing.\n\nThe [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas]] has stopped printing this banknote in 1996 (with its last production year is 1995), and it has been replaced by an [[Philippine five peso coin|equivalent coin]].\n\n===10-peso banknote===\nThe 10-peso banknote designed by Rafael Asuncion was issued months after the 5-peso banknote was issued.\n\nThe banknote was predominantly colored brown.\n\nThe obverse side of the 10-peso banknote featured [[Apolinario Mabini]] on the left and [[Andr\u00e9s Bonifacio]] on the right. Bonifacio was the founder of the [[Katipunan]] (KKK), a secret society established to fight the Spanish colonial government. Mabini was the Philippines' first [[Prime Minister of the Philippines|Prime Minister]] and [[Department of Foreign Affairs (Philippines)|Secretary of Foreign Affairs]]. Depicted on the right side was one of the flags of the Katipunan (see [[Flags of the Philippine Revolution]]), the ''Kartilya ng Katipunan'', and a letter written by Mabini.\n\nThe reverse side of the banknote featured the [[Barasoain Church]] in [[Malolos, Bulacan]], site of the first Philippine Congress and where the [[Constitution of the Philippines|Malolos Constitution]] was drafted. The right portion depicted the initiation rites of the Katipunan. Members accepted into the society had to sign their name on the society's roster using their own blood. The design was previously used on the 5-peso  \"Pilipino\" and \"Ang Bagong Lipunan\" notes.\n\nBefore 1997, the 10-peso banknote only depicted Mabini and the Barasoain Church. In recent years, the banknote has since been replaced with a [[Bi-metallic coins|bi-metallic]] 10-peso coin also bearing the effigies of Bonifacio and Mabini.\n\nThe Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas has stopped printing this banknote in 2002 (with its last production year is 2001) and was replaced by a [[Philippine ten peso coin|ten peso coin]].\n\n===20-peso banknote===\nThe 20 peso bill was designed by Angel Cacnio. The obverse side of the 20-peso banknote featured [[Manuel L. Quezon]], first president of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]]. Along the right side of the banknote was the coat-of-arms of the Commonwealth, and two of Quezon's notable accomplishments. The first was \"''Wikang Pambans\u00e2''\", which is [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] for \"national language\". In 1937, the [[Commission on the Filipino Language|National Language Institute]] was founded to establish a single national language for the Philippines. This eventually became the [[Filipino language]],  which is largely based on Tagalog. The second was the \"''Saligang Batas 1935''\" or the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1935 Constitution of the Philippines]]. This was the first real constitution that was nationally effected and large parts of it survive in the current constitution.\n\nThe banknote was predominantly colored orange.\n\nThe reverse side of the 20-peso banknote depicted [[Malaca\u00f1an Palace]], more popularly known as Malaca\u00f1ang, the residence of the [[President of the Philippines]], along the banks of the [[Pasig River]]. Quezon was the first Philippine president to live in the Palace.\n\n===50-peso banknote===\nDepicted on the front side of the fifty-peso was [[Sergio Osme\u00f1a]], the second president of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]]. He served as president from 1944, after Quezon's death, to 1946, when the United States granted the Philippines' independence.\n\nThe banknote was predominantly colored red and was designed by Rafael Asuncion.\n\nThe [[National Museum of the Philippines|National Museum]] was featured on the reverse side of the banknote. This building used to be the Legislative Building, where the House of Representatives that Osmena presided over as Speaker from 1907 to 1922 was located. The building and then renamed Executive House during the Martial Law period and was labeled as such in the fifty-peso banknote until recently.\n\n===100-peso banknote===\nThe front side of the 100-peso banknote featured [[Manuel Roxas]], the first president of the independent Philippine Republic. This independence was shown at the right side where the [[Flag of the Philippines|Philippine flag]] was raised while the flag of the [[United States]] was lowered on July 4, 1946.\n\nThe banknote was predominantly colored violet and was designed by Angel Cacnio.\n\nThe reverse side of the banknote depicted the Manila compound of the ''Bangko Sentral''.\n\nThe 100-peso banknote was the smallest-valued banknote to have the new security features implemented in recent years. But before the advent of the new security features, the 100-peso banknote was interesting for having other security features. On the front side was a barely visible \"100\" logo above the signatures of the president and the Central Bank governor. This logo was best seen on crisp new 100-peso banknotes. On the reverse side, the top row of windows of the main building had the words \"''Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas''\" (\"Central Bank of the Philippines\") running the whole length.\n\nThe 100-peso banknote became the subject of controversy after banknotes printed in France in time for the [[Christmas in the Philippines|Christmas season]] were printed with the President's name misspelled, the first in Philippine history.  The banknotes, of which a small amount were still in circulation and were legal tender until 2015, spelled the President's name as \"Gloria Macapagal-'''Arrovo'''\" versus the correct [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]]. The incident was subsequently the subject of public humor as soon as the issue made national headlines. The BSP probed the mistake and corrected the error afterwards.\n\n===200-peso banknote===\nThe front side of the 200-peso banknote featured the portrait of [[Diosdado Macapagal]]. It also featured the [[Aguinaldo Shrine]] in [[Kawit, Cavite]].\n\nThe back side of the banknote featured a scene from [[Second EDSA Revolution|EDSA II]], with [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]], Macapagal's daughter, being sworn in as [[President of the Philippines|president]] by Chief Justice [[Hilario Davide, Jr.]] in January 2001. The little girl holding a [[Bible]] in between Arroyo and Davide is Cecilia Paz Razon Abad, daughter of Philippine Budget and Management Secretary [[Florencio Abad]] and [[Batanes]] [[Congress of the Philippines|Representative]] Henedina Razon-Abad.<ref>[http://news.inq7.net/nation/index.php?index=1&story_id=63539]</ref>\n\nThe banknote was predominantly colored green.  This note was also a commemorative banknote, released in 2002 to commemorate [[Independence Day (Philippines)|Philippine independence]].\n\nThe banknote was the subject of criticism by the [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]].  They said that the legal tender should only feature deceased national heroes and not an incumbent President.  Although, it wasn't the first time that a legal tender featured a sitting President.  Legal tender coinage was minted to commemorate the inauguration of [[Manuel L. Quezon]] as [[President of the Philippines]] in 1935. Emergency currency during World War II had many instances where provincial emergency currency boards placed the image of then President [[Manuel L. Quezon]]. In 1975, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas released a 5-peso coin featuring the face of then President [[Ferdinand Marcos]].  Former presidents [[Fidel Ramos]] and [[Joseph Estrada]] was also pictured in a limited commemorative 2000-peso banknote that honors the 100-year celebration of Philippine Independence. Also a limited commemorative gold 1000-peso banknote with the picture of former President [[Joseph Estrada]] was also issued to honor the 100-year celebration of Philippine Independence. Also, every banknote series since 1935 has borne the facsimile signature of the incumbent [[President of the Philippines]].\n\nSome critics including Father [[Robert Reyes]] also pointed out that featuring Gloria Arroyo in the 200-peso note could be an electioneering tactic ahead of the [[2004 Philippine general election|2004 Philippine elections]].<ref>http://www.newsflash.org/2002/04/be/be002037.htm</ref>\n\n===500-peso banknote===\nThe front side of the 500-peso banknote featured the portrait of [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.]] To the right of the banknote, there were two popular quotes from Aquino: \"Faith in our people and faith in God\", and \"The Filipino is worth dying for\", under which was signed his nickname, \"Ninoy\". There was also the signature of Aquino, a typewriter with his initials (\"B.S.A.J.\"), and a dove of peace.  A Philippine flag was also to the right of his portrait, near the central part of the front side.\n\nThe reverse side featured a collage of various images in relation to Aquino.  He was (in front of an article about \"[[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cav]]\", out of some of the pictures) a journalist for the ''[[Manila Times]]'', a senator (the pioneer of the Study Now, Pay Later education program), the mayor in his hometown of [[Concepcion, Tarlac|Concepcion]], the governor of [[Tarlac]], and was the main driving force behind the [[People Power Revolution]] of 1986,<ref name=\"EDSA 1986\"/><ref name=\"EDSA 1986-2\"/> some three years after his death in 1983.\n\nThe banknote was predominantly colored yellow.\n\nIt was also interesting to note that unlike the names of the figures on the bills, \"Benigno S. Aquino, Jr.\" was written in gold-colored, cursive writing with a green laurel wreath as opposed to the name being simply written as with the other banknotes.\n\nBefore this note was printed, the 500-peso banknote designed by Romeo Mananquil was to feature [[Ferdinand Marcos]] and was its reverse was to be the [[Batasang Pambansa Complex]]. The [[People Power Revolution]] caused it to be replaced by the current 500-peso banknote. Remnants of this version of the banknote were only for media purposes.\n\nOn August 16, 2009, a proposal was made by the [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas]]  to have former President [[Corazon Aquino|Cory Aquino]] accompany her husband, [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.|Ninoy Aquino]] on the banknote. The new design was included in the 500-peso NGC note.\n\n===1,000-peso banknote===\nThe front side of the 1,000-peso banknote featured the portraits of [[Jos\u00e9 Abad Santos]], Chief Justice;  [[Josefa Llanes Escoda]], civic worker and one of the founders of the [[Girl Scouts of the Philippines]];  and [[Vicente Lim]], a general in the Philippine Army, first Filipino graduate of [[United States Military Academy|West Point]]: the three are considered heroes of the resistance against the Japanese occupation of the Philippines.  It also featured the [[eternal flame]], [[Bay laurel|laurel leaves]], and bank seal.\n\nThe back of the banknote featured the [[Banaue Rice Terraces]], [[Manunggul Jar]] cover and Langgal.\n\nThe banknote was predominantly colored blue and was designed by Romeo Mananquil.\n\nSecurity features of the banknote included optically variable ink, a security thread, scattered red & blue visible fibers, and fluorescent printing.

The reverse of the banknote featured a depiction of the Philippine declaration of independence by Emilio Aguinaldo on June 12, 1898.\n\nSecurity features of the banknote included a security thread, scattered red & blue visible fibers, and fluorescent printing.\n\nThe [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas]] has stopped printing this banknote in 1996 (with its last production year is 1995), and it has been replaced by an [[Philippine five peso coin|equivalent coin]].\n\n===10-peso banknote===\nThe 10-peso banknote designed by Rafael Asuncion was issued months after the 5-peso banknote was issued.\n\nThe banknote was predominantly colored brown.\n\nThe obverse side of the 10-peso banknote featured [[Apolinario Mabini]] on the left and [[Andr\u00e9s Bonifacio]] on the right. Bonifacio was the founder of the [[Katipunan]] (KKK), a secret society established to fight the Spanish colonial government. Mabini was the Philippines' first [[Prime Minister of the Philippines|Prime Minister]] and [[Department of Foreign Affairs (Philippines)|Secretary of Foreign Affairs]]. Depicted on the right side was one of the flags of the Katipunan (see [[Flags of the Philippine Revolution]]), the ''Kartilya ng Katipunan'', and a letter written by Mabini.\n\nThe reverse side of the banknote featured the [[Barasoain Church]] in [[Malolos, Bulacan]], site of the first Philippine Congress and where the [[Constitution of the Philippines|Malolos Constitution]] was drafted. The right portion depicted the initiation rites of the Katipunan. Members accepted into the society had to sign their name on the society's roster using their own blood. The design was previously used on the 5-peso  \"Pilipino\" and \"Ang Bagong Lipunan\" notes.\n\nBefore 1997, the 10-peso banknote only depicted Mabini and the Barasoain Church. In recent years, the banknote has since been replaced with a [[Bi-metallic coins|bi-metallic]] 10-peso coin also bearing the effigies of Bonifacio and Mabini.\n\nThe Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas has stopped printing this banknote in 2002 (with its last production year is 2001) and was replaced by a [[Philippine ten peso coin|ten peso coin]].\n\n===20-peso banknote===\nThe 20 peso bill was designed by Angel Cacnio. The obverse side of the 20-peso banknote featured [[Manuel L. Quezon]], first president of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]]. Along the right side of the banknote was the coat-of-arms of the Commonwealth, and two of Quezon's notable accomplishments. The first was \"''Wikang Pambans\u00e2''\", which is [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] for \"national language\". In 1937, the [[Commission on the Filipino Language|National Language Institute]] was founded to establish a single national language for the Philippines. This eventually became the [[Filipino language]],  which is largely based on Tagalog. The second was the \"''Saligang Batas 1935''\" or the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1935 Constitution of the Philippines]]. This was the first real constitution that was nationally effected and large parts of it survive in the current constitution.\n\nThe banknote was predominantly colored orange.\n\nThe reverse side of the 20-peso banknote depicted [[Malaca\u00f1an Palace]], more popularly known as Malaca\u00f1ang, the residence of the [[President of the Philippines]], along the banks of the [[Pasig River]]. Quezon was the first Philippine president to live in the Palace.\n\n===50-peso banknote===\nDepicted on the front side of the fifty-peso was [[Sergio Osme\u00f1a]], the second president of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]]. He served as president from 1944, after Quezon's death, to 1946, when the United States granted the Philippines' independence.\n\nThe banknote was predominantly colored red and was designed by Rafael Asuncion.\n\nThe [[National Museum of the Philippines|National Museum]] was featured on the reverse side of the banknote. This building used to be the Legislative Building, where the House of Representatives that Osmena presided over as Speaker from 1907 to 1922 was located. The building and then renamed Executive House during the Martial Law period and was labeled as such in the fifty-peso banknote until recently.\n\n===100-peso banknote===\nThe front side of the 100-peso banknote featured [[Manuel Roxas]], the first president of the independent Philippine Republic. This independence was shown at the right side where the [[Flag of the Philippines|Philippine flag]] was raised while the flag of the [[United States]] was lowered on July 4, 1946.\n\nThe banknote was predominantly colored violet and was designed by Angel Cacnio.\n\nThe reverse side of the banknote depicted the Manila compound of the ''Bangko Sentral''.\n\nThe 100-peso banknote was the smallest-valued banknote to have the new security features implemented in recent years. But before the advent of the new security features, the 100-peso banknote was interesting for having other security features. On the front side was a barely visible \"100\" logo above the signatures of the president and the Central Bank governor. This logo was best seen on crisp new 100-peso banknotes. On the reverse side, the top row of windows of the main building had the words \"''Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas''\" (\"Central Bank of the Philippines\") running the whole length.\n\nThe 100-peso banknote became the subject of controversy after banknotes printed in France in time for the [[Christmas in the Philippines|Christmas season]] were printed with the President's name misspelled, the first in Philippine history.  The banknotes, of which a small amount were still in circulation and were legal tender until 2015, spelled the President's name as \"Gloria Macapagal-'''Arrovo'''\" versus the correct [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]]. The incident was subsequently the subject of public humor as soon as the issue made national headlines. The BSP probed the mistake and corrected the error afterwards.\n\n===200-peso banknote===\nThe front side of the 200-peso banknote featured the portrait of [[Diosdado Macapagal]]. It also featured the [[Aguinaldo Shrine]] in [[Kawit, Cavite]].\n\nThe back side of the banknote featured a scene from [[Second EDSA Revolution|EDSA II]], with [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]], Macapagal's daughter, being sworn in as [[President of the Philippines|president]] by Chief Justice [[Hilario Davide, Jr.]] in January 2001. The little girl holding a [[Bible]] in between Arroyo and Davide is Cecilia Paz Razon Abad, daughter of Philippine Budget and Management Secretary [[Florencio Abad]] and [[Batanes]] [[Congress of the Philippines|Representative]] Henedina Razon-Abad.<ref>[http://news.inq7.net/nation/index.php?index=1&story_id=63539]</ref>\n\nThe banknote was predominantly colored green.  This note was also a commemorative banknote, released in 2002 to commemorate [[Independence Day (Philippines)|Philippine independence]].\n\nThe banknote was the subject of criticism by the [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]].  They said that the legal tender should only feature deceased national heroes and not an incumbent President.  Although, it wasn't the first time that a legal tender featured a sitting President.  Legal tender coinage was minted to commemorate the inauguration of [[Manuel L. Quezon]] as [[President of the Philippines]] in 1935. Emergency currency during World War II had many instances where provincial emergency currency boards placed the image of then President [[Manuel L. Quezon]]. In 1975, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas released a 5-peso coin featuring the face of then President [[Ferdinand Marcos]].  Former presidents [[Fidel Ramos]] and [[Joseph Estrada]] was also pictured in a limited commemorative 2000-peso banknote that honors the 100-year celebration of Philippine Independence. Also a limited commemorative gold 1000-peso banknote with the picture of former President [[Joseph Estrada]] was also issued to honor the 100-year celebration of Philippine Independence. Also, every banknote series since 1935 has borne the facsimile signature of the incumbent [[President of the Philippines]].\n\nSome critics including Father [[Robert Reyes]] also pointed out that featuring Gloria Arroyo in the 200-peso note could be an electioneering tactic ahead of the [[2004 Philippine general election|2004 Philippine elections]].<ref>http://www.newsflash.org/2002/04/be/be002037.htm</ref>\n\n===500-peso banknote===\nThe front side of the 500-peso banknote featured the portrait of [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.]] To the right of the banknote, there were two popular quotes from Aquino: \"Faith in our people and faith in God\", and \"The Filipino is worth dying for\", under which was signed his nickname, \"Ninoy\". There was also the signature of Aquino, a typewriter with his initials (\"B.S.A.J.\"), and a dove of peace.  A Philippine flag was also to the right of his portrait, near the central part of the front side.\n\nThe reverse side featured a collage of various images in relation to Aquino.  He was (in front of an article about \"[[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cav]]\", out of some of the pictures) a journalist for the ''[[Manila Times]]'', a senator (the pioneer of the Study Now, Pay Later education program), the mayor in his hometown of [[Concepcion, Tarlac|Concepcion]], the governor of [[Tarlac]], and was the main driving force behind the [[People Power Revolution]] of 1986,<ref name=\"EDSA 1986\"/><ref name=\"EDSA 1986-2\"/> some three years after his death in 1983.\n\nThe banknote was predominantly colored yellow.\n\nIt was also interesting to note that unlike the names of the figures on the bills, \"Benigno S. Aquino, Jr.\" was written in gold-colored, cursive writing with a green laurel wreath as opposed to the name being simply written as with the other banknotes.\n\nBefore this note was printed, the 500-peso banknote designed by Romeo Mananquil was to feature [[Ferdinand Marcos]] and was its reverse was to be the [[Batasang Pambansa Complex]]. The [[People Power Revolution]] caused it to be replaced by the current 500-peso banknote. Remnants of this version of the banknote were only for media purposes.\n\nOn August 16, 2009, a proposal was made by the [[Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas]]  to have former President [[Corazon Aquino|Cory Aquino]] accompany her husband, [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.|Ninoy Aquino]] on the banknote. The new design was included in the 500-peso NGC note.\n\n===1,000-peso banknote===\nThe front side of the 1,000-peso banknote featured the portraits of [[Jos\u00e9 Abad Santos]], Chief Justice;  [[Josefa Llanes Escoda]], civic worker and one of the founders of the [[Girl Scouts of the Philippines]];  and [[Vicente Lim]], a general in the Philippine Army, first Filipino graduate of [[United States Military Academy|West Point]]: the three are considered heroes of the resistance against the Japanese occupation of the Philippines.  It also featured the [[eternal flame]], [[Bay laurel|laurel leaves]], and bank seal.\n\nThe back of the banknote featured the [[Banaue Rice Terraces]], [[Manunggul Jar]] cover and Langgal.\n\nThe banknote was predominantly colored blue and was designed by Romeo Mananquil.\n\nSecurity features of the banknote included optically variable ink, a security thread, scattered red & blue visible fibers, and fluorescent printing.
