He played [[high school football]] at Downsview High School in Toronto.

The film was released on 10 January 2019.\n\n== Plot ==\nThookku Durai is the well-respected chieftain of his village Koduvilaarpatti of [[Theni district]]. After 10 years, a thiruvizha ([[festival]]) is set to occur at the village's [[Ayyanar]] temple, when Thooku Durai's rival Kozhimuthu tries to stop it from occurring. The thiruvizha occurs thanks to Thooku Durai's intervention; however, his aunts and grandmother have been longing to see his wife and daughter. After much deliberation, Thooku Durai decides to go to Mumbai to meet them.\n\nOn the journey, Merit and Rosamani are upset over Thooku Durai's current life and remind him of his life 10-12 years ago. Thooku Durai used to be a happy-go-lucky man and rice mill owner. He was also a [[Good Samaritan]], albeit using violent ways to deal with problems. While chasing a few goons, he stumbles across Niranjana, a doctor, who witnesses his antics and lodges a case against him. When Thooku Durai sees Niranjana, he is immediately smitten by her and surrenders to the police out of the love that he has for her, but she is later forced to release him after Aavudaiyappan threatens to close her medical camp unless she pays him. After fighting the goons, Thooku Durai relocates her camp to his rice mill. Niranjana realizes her love for Thooku Durai and proposes to him, which he gladly accepts. They get married and lead a happy life, but Niranjana is disturbed by Thooku Durai's involvement into feuds. Soon, she gets pregnant and is accepted to go to one of the finest pharmaceutical programs abroad, which she refuses for Thooku Durai. After their child is born, one day, Niranjana leaves out of town, after getting a promise from Thooku Durai not to bring Swetha to any fights, and on the way to pick her up, Aavudaiyappan, waiting for revenge, picks up a fight with Thooku Durai. Thooku Durai, not finding Niranjana at the train station, finds her at home, and the baby passes out as she had been injured during the fight. After rushing to the emergency ward, she survives, but Niranjana gets infuriated at Thooku Durai and tells him to stay away from her and the baby, and she then leaves him.\n\nBack to the present day, Thooku Durai tries to meet up with Niranjana at her company, Niranjana Pharmaceuticals, to no avail. He later sees his daughter Swetha, who is in contention for the Junior National 100m title. Swetha travels home, when attempts are made to kill her Thooku Durai arrives at the nick of time to save her. It is then revealed that Gautham Veer is the one behind this as his daughter Neha had been paralyzed while attempting suicide. Gautham is the CEO of Skyline exports and owns a range of multinational companies, and expects the first position in everything, as he used to achieve the same in his earlier days, including academics and sports. He expects the same of Neha, who is slower than Swetha by milliseconds. After Gautham threatens Neha that she would find no affection in him if she loses, she resorts to [[Doping in sport|doping]], which helps her win the race. Unfortunately, this is found out by Swetha, who reports it to the authorities. Fearing that her father's reputation and affection would completely vanish, Neha attempts suicide but becomes paralyzed in the process. Gautham is distraught on seeing his daughter's condition and vows to have Swetha killed at any cost. \n\nAfter saving her, Thooku Durai requests Niranjana to appoint him as Swetha's bodyguard for the next 10 days, until her competition, on the condition that he does not reveal any information about him being her father, to which she reluctantly accepts. He enjoys being in the company of his daughter, whilst saving her from goons on multiple occasions. Thooku Durai later meets Gautham face-to-face and challenges him. Unfortunately, Thooku Durai is run over a car before Swetha's competition and is critical. Swetha then is forced to leave for America, and Thooku Durai recovers. Swetha also brings Gautham's daughter and mother. Before the competition, Gautham fights an already injured Thooku Durai, at which point Niranjana reveals that Thooku Durai is Swetha's father. Swetha lags behind during the meet as she has no encouragement. Thooku Durai fights Gautham back, reaches the track, and encourages his daughter by whistling. Swetha wins the race. At the same time, Gautham arrives at the track to attack Thooku Durai, but after seeing his daughter's recovery, he realizes his mistake. Thooku Durai tells Gautham that children should grow up as they desire and not to burden them with what the parents desire. Swetha is announced as the winner, along with Thooku Durai's name added to her name by Niranjana, and they reunite with Thooku Durai.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Ajith Kumar]] as Thookku Durai<ref>[https://www.timesnownews.com/entertainment/south-gossip/article/viswasam-motion-poster-ajith-in-his-two-looks-has-stolen-the-hearts-of-his-fans/320736 Viswasam motion poster: Ajith, in his two looks, has stolen the hearts of his fans]. timesnownews.com. 26 November 2018</ref>\n* [[Nayanthara]] as Niranjana Thooku Durai\n* [[Jagapathi Babu]] as Gautham Veer\n* [[Anikha]] as Swetha Thooku Durai\n* [[Vivek (actor)|Vivek]] as Kesavan\n* [[Yogi Babu]] as Velu\n* [[Thambi Ramaiah]] as Rosamani\n* [[Robo Shankar]] as Merit\n* [[Kovai Sarala]] as Filomina\n* [[Kalairani]] as Pechiammal, Thookudurai's aunt\n* [[Sujatha Sivakumar]] as Thookudurai's aunt\n* [[R.

The film stars [[Ajith Kumar]] and [[Nayanthara]]. Produced by [[Sathya Jyothi Films]], the film was officially announced on 20 November 2017 and [[principal photography]] began in May 2018. The film was released on 10 January 2019.\n\n== Plot ==\nThookku Durai is the well-respected chieftain of his village Koduvilaarpatti of [[Theni district]]. After 10 years, a thiruvizha ([[festival]]) is set to occur at the village's [[Ayyanar]] temple, when Thooku Durai's rival Kozhimuthu tries to stop it from occurring. The thiruvizha occurs thanks to Thooku Durai's intervention; however, his aunts and grandmother have been longing to see his wife and daughter. After much deliberation, Thooku Durai decides to go to Mumbai to meet them.\n\nOn the journey, Merit and Rosamani are upset over Thooku Durai's current life and remind him of his life 10-12 years ago. Thooku Durai used to be a happy-go-lucky man and rice mill owner. He was also a [[Good Samaritan]], albeit using violent ways to deal with problems. While chasing a few goons, he stumbles across Niranjana, a doctor, who witnesses his antics and lodges a case against him. When Thooku Durai sees Niranjana, he is immediately smitten by her and surrenders to the police out of the love that he has for her, but she is later forced to release him after Aavudaiyappan threatens to close her medical camp unless she pays him. After fighting the goons, Thooku Durai relocates her camp to his rice mill. Niranjana realizes her love for Thooku Durai and proposes to him, which he gladly accepts. They get married and lead a happy life, but Niranjana is disturbed by Thooku Durai's involvement into feuds. Soon, she gets pregnant and is accepted to go to one of the finest pharmaceutical programs abroad, which she refuses for Thooku Durai. After their child is born, one day, Niranjana leaves out of town, after getting a promise from Thooku Durai not to bring Swetha to any fights, and on the way to pick her up, Aavudaiyappan, waiting for revenge, picks up a fight with Thooku Durai. Thooku Durai, not finding Niranjana at the train station, finds her at home, and the baby passes out as she had been injured during the fight. After rushing to the emergency ward, she survives, but Niranjana gets infuriated at Thooku Durai and tells him to stay away from her and the baby, and she then leaves him.\n\nBack to the present day, Thooku Durai tries to meet up with Niranjana at her company, Niranjana Pharmaceuticals, to no avail. He later sees his daughter Swetha, who is in contention for the Junior National 100m title. Swetha travels home, when attempts are made to kill her Thooku Durai arrives at the nick of time to save her. It is then revealed that Gautham Veer is the one behind this as his daughter Neha had been paralyzed while attempting suicide. Gautham is the CEO of Skyline exports and owns a range of multinational companies, and expects the first position in everything, as he used to achieve the same in his earlier days, including academics and sports. He expects the same of Neha, who is slower than Swetha by milliseconds. After Gautham threatens Neha that she would find no affection in him if she loses, she resorts to [[Doping in sport|doping]], which helps her win the race. Unfortunately, this is found out by Swetha, who reports it to the authorities. Fearing that her father's reputation and affection would completely vanish, Neha attempts suicide but becomes paralyzed in the process. Gautham is distraught on seeing his daughter's condition and vows to have Swetha killed at any cost. \n\nAfter saving her, Thooku Durai requests Niranjana to appoint him as Swetha's bodyguard for the next 10 days, until her competition, on the condition that he does not reveal any information about him being her father, to which she reluctantly accepts. He enjoys being in the company of his daughter, whilst saving her from goons on multiple occasions. Thooku Durai later meets Gautham face-to-face and challenges him. Unfortunately, Thooku Durai is run over a car before Swetha's competition and is critical. Swetha then is forced to leave for America, and Thooku Durai recovers. Swetha also brings Gautham's daughter and mother. Before the competition, Gautham fights an already injured Thooku Durai, at which point Niranjana reveals that Thooku Durai is Swetha's father. Swetha lags behind during the meet as she has no encouragement. Thooku Durai fights Gautham back, reaches the track, and encourages his daughter by whistling. Swetha wins the race. At the same time, Gautham arrives at the track to attack Thooku Durai, but after seeing his daughter's recovery, he realizes his mistake. Thooku Durai tells Gautham that children should grow up as they desire and not to burden them with what the parents desire. Swetha is announced as the winner, along with Thooku Durai's name added to her name by Niranjana, and they reunite with Thooku Durai.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Ajith Kumar]] as Thookku Durai<ref>[https://www.timesnownews.com/entertainment/south-gossip/article/viswasam-motion-poster-ajith-in-his-two-looks-has-stolen-the-hearts-of-his-fans/320736 Viswasam motion poster: Ajith, in his two looks, has stolen the hearts of his fans]. timesnownews.com. 26 November 2018</ref>\n* [[Nayanthara]] as Niranjana Thooku Durai\n* [[Jagapathi Babu]] as Gautham Veer\n* [[Anikha]] as Swetha Thooku Durai\n* [[Vivek (actor)|Vivek]] as Kesavan\n* [[Yogi Babu]] as Velu\n* [[Thambi Ramaiah]] as Rosamani\n* [[Robo Shankar]] as Merit\n* [[Kovai Sarala]] as Filomina\n* [[Kalairani]] as Pechiammal, Thookudurai's aunt\n* [[Sujatha Sivakumar]] as Thookudurai's aunt\n* [[R.

Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]], the character first appeared in [[Uncanny X-Men|''The X-Men'']] #1 (September 1963).\n\nIceman is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] born with superhuman abilities. He has the ability to manipulate ice and cold by freezing [[water vapor]] around him. This allows him to freeze objects, as well as turn his body into [[ice]].\n\nThe character received widespread media attention when it was revealed that he was gay in ''[[All-New X-Men]]'' #40. Iceman is notable for being one of the most prominent [[LGBT themes in comics|gay characters in comic books]]. \n\nThe character has been frequently present in X-Men and [[Spider-Man]]-related [[American comic book|comics]], video games, animated series, and movies. [[Shawn Ashmore]] portrayed Iceman in the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' films]], and voices the character in ''[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]''.\n\n==Publication history==\n{{expand section|date=March 2015}}\nCreated by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist/co-writer [[Jack Kirby]], the character first appeared in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|X-Men]]'' #1 ([[1963 in comics#September|September 1963]]). Lee later admitted that Iceman was created essentially as a copy of the [[Human Torch]], only using the opposite element for his power.<ref>{{cite news | last1 = O'Neill | first1 = Patrick Daniel | last2 = Lee | first2 = Stan | authorlink2 = Stan Lee | date = August 1993 | title = X Marks the Spot | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]: X-Men Turn Thirty | pages = 8\u20139 | quote = Then I wanted a character sort of like the Torch. What's opposite of fire? Ice. Water might have been the opposite, but I couldn't think of anything to do visually with water. I felt a little guilty because Iceman was such a copy of the Human Torch in an opposite way.}}</ref>\n\nIceman was featured in two self-titled limited comic book miniseries, one in 1984\u201385 written by [[J. M. DeMatteis]] and another in the 2000s by Andy Lanning and Dan Abnett, with art by [[Karl Kerschl]]. DeMatteis said of the first series, \"It was my idea, so there was no one to blame but myself. I'll just say that it was a mistake and if the series made any sense whatsoever it was due to [editor] [[Bob Budiansky]]. That was a case where the editor's input was really needed\u2014and Bob was a big help.\"<ref>{{cite news | first1 = Jim | last1 = Salicrup | first2 = Mike | last2 = Higgins | authorlink1 = Jim Salicrup | date = October 1986 | title = J.

He was a main character in the first volume of ''X-Factor'', and a star in flashback stories when he was a teenager in ''X-Men: The Hidden Years'' and ''X-Men: First Class''.\n\nIn April 2015, in issue 40 of ''All-New X-Men'', a time-displaced version of the teenaged Iceman was revealed as [[gay]] by his teammate, [[Jean Grey]], who discerned this with her telepathic ability.<ref>Hanks, Henry.

His father is [[Irish-American]] [[Catholic]], and his mother is [[Jewish-American|Jewish]].<ref>''Iceman'' #1 (December 1984). Marvel Comics.</ref> Bobby's powers first manifested when he was on a date with Judy Harmon, and a local bully by the name of Rocky Beasely tried to take Judy away for himself. Knowing Judy could not put up a good fight, Bobby pointed his hand at Beasely and encased him in a block of ice. Later, the local townspeople, having heard of the incident, came looking for him in the form of an angry mob. The local sheriff had no choice but to put Bobby in jail for his own \"protection\". While Bobby sat in his cell at the sheriff station, the outer wall was blown open, and a young man named [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Scott Summers]] walked in and offered to take Bobby with him. After Bobby turned him down, the two mutants got into a short battle, which was soon ended by the arrival of [[Professor X|Professor Charles Xavier]].<ref>''X-Men'' #44\u201346</ref>\n\nAfter Xavier spoke with Bobby and his parents, Bobby's parents suggested that he go with Professor Xavier to his \"school for gifted youngsters\". Bobby took the suggestion and left with Professor Xavier and Cyclops to become the second member of the [[X-Men]]. He is later joined by [[Beast (comics)|Henry \"Hank\" McCoy]], [[Jean Grey]], and [[Warren Worthington III]] as the founding members of the X-Men. Drake remains self-conscious regarding the fact that he is the youngest member of the group. Appearing in his original snow covered form, he first battles [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] along with the rest of the team,<ref>''X-Men'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> and later the [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]].<ref>''X-Men'' #4</ref> Bobby Drake's first girlfriend is Zelda.<ref>''X-Men'' #7.

Marvel Comics.</ref> He then battles the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]],<ref>''X-Men'' #13. Marvel Comics.</ref> and is badly injured in his first battle against the [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]].<ref>''X-Men'' #14\u201317</ref> He next battles Magneto by himself.<ref>''X-Men'' #18. Marvel Comics.</ref> Later, he visits [[Subterranea (comics)|Subterranea]] for the first time.<ref>''X-Men'' #34. Marvel Comics.</ref> Then, he and Beast battle the [[Maha Yogi]].<ref>''X-Men'' #47</ref> During his original stint with the X-Men, Drake pursues a relationship with [[Polaris (Marvel Comics)|Lorna Dane]], although the relationship does not last. Iceman is among the original X-Men captured by [[Krakoa]], leading to a new incarnation of X-Men of which he is not a member. With most of the original team, he quits the X-Men.<ref>''X-Men'' #94. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n====Champions and Defenders====\nIceman moves to the American west coast to attend [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] and becomes a founding member of [[Champions (1975 team)|The Champions]] of Los Angeles.<ref>''Champions'' #1, October 1975. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, the Champions soon dissolve.<ref>''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #17. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIceman is then abducted by [[Master Mold]], and alongside Angel, he encounters the [[Hulk]].<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> Iceman next aids the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] in battling the [[Circus of Crime]].<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #76. Marvel Comics.</ref> Drake retires from life as a superhero to earn a college degree in accounting \u2013 but apparently at a college on the east coast, not UCLA.<ref>''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #145, p. 10, panel 1. Marvel Comics.</ref> While in college, he briefly rejoins the X-Men to rescue the captives of [[Arcade (Marvel Comics)|Arcade]]'s henchman, Miss Locke.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #145\u2013146. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIceman is reunited with Beast, encounters Cloud, and then returns as a full-time superhero in an incarnation of the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]] alongside his former teammates, Angel and Beast.<ref>''Defenders'' #122\u2013123, 125. Marvel Comics.</ref> He also battles [[Professor Power]]'s [[Secret Empire (organization)|Secret Empire]] while with the Defenders.<ref>''Defenders'' #127\u2013129. Marvel Comics.</ref> After the Defenders disband, Drake embarks on his career as an accountant.\n\nSome time later, Iceman encounters Mirage, the \"daughter\" of [[Oblivion (comics)|Oblivion]]. Iceman journeys back in time and meets his parents before he was born, and battles Oblivion and Mirage. He then reconciles with his parents.<ref>''Iceman'' #1\u20134. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n====X-Factor====\nThe original X-Men, including Iceman, reunite to form the superhero team [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]].<ref>''X-Factor'' #1 (February 1986). Marvel Comics.</ref> With this new team, he encounters [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] for the first time.<ref>''X-Factor'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring his time with the team, [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] captures Bobby, hoping to use him to gain control over the [[Giants (Marvel Comics)|Frost Giants]]. Loki enhances Bobby's powers and then extracts them to restore the size of the [[Giants (Marvel Comics)|Frost Giants]]. Iceman is rescued by [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].<ref>''Thor'' #377\u2013378. Marvel Comics.</ref> Loki's tampering increases Bobby's powers to such an extent that he begins to lose control of his abilities. During a later battle with the [[The Right (comics)|Right]], he is fitted with a power-dampening belt which actually helps him control his abilities. Once able only to sheathe his own body in a protective coating of ice, Bobby finds he can encase the entirety of the [[Empire State Building]]. With time, Bobby gains sufficient control over his augmented powers and is able to stop using the inhibitor belt. Believing he has achieved his full potential, Bobby does not attempt to develop his abilities further.\n\nWith X-Factor, Bobby then defeats [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Apocalypse's Horsemen]].<ref>''X-Factor'' #19. Marvel Comics.</ref> Iceman helps watch over many of the younger superheroes, something he once was. Most notably, he and Beast help [[Tabitha Smith|Boom Boom]] gain a more normal life. For a brief while, he also helps supervise the [[New Mutants]] and their sister team, the [[X-Terminators]]. They, in turn, save him from the deadly kiss of [[Infectia]].<ref>''X-Factor'' #29\u201331. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nBobby also develops a romantic relationship with [[Opal Tanaka]]. After a session of ice sledding, she discovers threatening mail in her mailbox, a precursor to harassment by her cybernetically-enhanced relatives of the Tatsu Clan of the Yakuza, which Bobby helps her out with.<ref>''X-Factor'' #63\u201364. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAfter the \"[[Muir Island Saga]]\", Iceman rejoins the X-Men along with the rest of X-Factor.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #281; ''X-Men'' vol. 2 #1</ref>\n\n====Back with the X-Men====\nWhen he rejoined the X-Men it seemed that he learned to control his powers and no longer needed the inhibitor belt, this made him believe he reached the limit of his powers.<ref>''X-Factor'' #70</ref> The X-Men were separated into two groups, Iceman was placed in the gold team, led by [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], along with fellow original X-Men Jean Grey (now without a code name) and Archangel.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #281. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nOne day he took Opal to eat with his parents, however his dad began humiliating her because of her Japanese heritage. The four are attacked by the Cyber-Samurai, which added to William Drake's prejudices about the girl.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #289. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Bobby came across [[Mikhail Rasputin]] he used his mutant abilities on him. Bobby discovered that his potential was still far from being reached as he converted his body into ice, not just covered by it.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #292. Marvel Comics.</ref> By turning his entire body to ice, instead of just wearing an icy exterior, Bobby now was capable of using his power in new, aggressive ways, adding spikes and padding to his ice structure.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #300. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nToo busy with the many threats that the X-Men faced every day, Bobby let his relationship with Opal deteriorate and, when they finally saw each other again after weeks, it was only to save her from an attack by mutant haters. Annoyed that she could only gain his attention by nearly getting killed, Opal broke off their relationship.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #305. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nLater, as he was checking on [[Emma Frost]] who was in a comatose state after the mutant [[Trevor Fitzroy]] unleashed the mutant-hunting Sentinels on Emma Frost and her students known as the [[Hellions (Marvel Comics)|Hellions]], the mansion was hit by an electricity breakdown.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #311. Marvel Comics.</ref> Emma woke up disoriented, possessed Bobby's mind, and used his powers in ways Bobby never had; she froze an entire river and traveled through water. She was looking for her pupils but after finding out they were dead, she left Bobby's body.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #314. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nBobby invites Rogue to tag along on a visit to his parents. Wrongly assuming a romantic relation, his father disapproves of Rogue, verbally attacking them with the same prejudices he expressed with Opal. This time, Bobby had enough and left after telling his father that he should just accept the fact that he is a mutant and he would never fit the definition he has of normal. He was upset that Emma exhibited greater control of his powers than he had. Since Rogue was having problems with Gambit, the two of them go on a road trip to ease their minds.<ref name=\"Uncanny319\"/>\n\nDuring the Legion Quest, Iceman was one of the X-Men who went back in time to stop [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|Legion]] from killing Magneto. They succeed, but only partially. Legion does not kill Magneto, but instead accidentally murdered Xavier, his own father, years before Legion had been conceived much less born. This paradox caused the events of the [[Age of Apocalypse]]. At the last moment before the original reality ended, Iceman's fellow X-Men, Rogue and Gambit shared a kiss. When reality resumed, Rogue's mind-absorbing touch renders Gambit comatose. Having absorbed some secret haunting memories, she needs to get away from the X-Men and Iceman volunteers to join her on a road trip, though at the same time he was starting to see visions of Emma Frost. When Gambit awoke from his coma, he tracked them down and confronted Rogue about what she saw in his mind. She broke off their relationship, Iceman and Gambit returned to the X-Men.<ref>''X-Men (2nd series)'' #45. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWhen the entity known as [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] first appeared, Iceman was chosen as one of his test subjects, along with Storm, Cyclops and Wolverine. They were pitted against a servant of Onslaught named [[Post (comics)|Post]], in a specific battle area of harsh environment to test the extent of their abilities. They won and were returned to the mansion. However, Iceman's chest had been shattered in his ice form during battle, making it impossible to change back to human form.<ref>''X-Men'' (Vol 2) #50. Marvel Comics.</ref> He confronted Emma Frost and demanded to know what she did to his powers in his body and how to save himself. She refused to help since she knew that Bobby would have to do it himself. When he captured her with his ice powers, she telepathically showed him his insecurities. By confronting Opal and his father in her simulation, Iceman realized that Emma was right and managed to transform back to his human body with his chest fully intact.<ref name=\"Uncanny X-Men #331\">''Uncanny X-Men'' #331. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWhen Graydon Creed was running for President (with a heavy anti mutant campaign), Bobby was chosen to infiltrate in the campaign. His father stood out in a crowd and spoke in favor of the mutants, which came as a surprise to Bobby. His father's connection with Bobby was discovered, so the people that worked for Graydon captured him and almost beat him to death. Bobby decided to stay away from the X-Men for a while to be with his dad.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #340. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nZero Tolerance came across and Bobby found and helped Cecilia Reyes who was trying to keep a secret that she was a mutant. They also joined with Charlotte Jones and the morlock Marrow. After Bastion was defeated, he took Cecilia and Marrow to the mansion, and soon left the X-Men again for a while to be with his parents.<ref>''X-Men (Vol 2)'' #69. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nMuch later, the X-Men found evidence in one of Destiny's journals of a group known as the Twelve, including Xavier, Magneto, Cyclops, Phoenix, Iceman, Polaris, Storm, Cable, Bishop, Sunfire, Mikhail Rasputin and the [[Living Monolith]]. They also learned that the Apocalypse's Horsemen had been kidnapping these mutants from around the globe. Iceman was captured in the woods near his home by Deathbird, who had become the Horseman War.<ref>''X-Men'' (2nd series) #96. Marvel Comics.</ref> Gathering the remaining Twelve, the X-Men traveled to Egypt and confronted Apocalypse and the Skrulls. Apocalypse and his forces captured all of the Twelve during the battle, using them in a ritual to give the Chaos-Bringer a new body and incredible power. Magneto and Polaris created opposite magnetic polarities, Iceman, Storm, and Sunfire provided elemental extremes, Cyclops, Phoenix, and Cable gave the sheer power of family, Xavier represented the power of mind and Bishop and Mikhail stood for time and space, while the Monolith linked all their energies together. Nate Grey was to be Apocalypse's new host, a powerhouse to store his massive lifeforce. The Twelve managed to free themselves and Cyclops sacrificed his own body and life force to keep Apocalypse from getting Nate. Though the new Apocalypse was defeated, Cyclops seemed lost forever.<ref>''X-Men'' (Vol 2) #97. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAfter that incident, Iceman helped the Beast to secretly enter Genosha, as he wanted to study the legacy-infected mutates. When the High Evolutionary released his anti-mutation wave, they were trapped in the war-ravaged country. With the aid of Magneto, they escaped and joined forces with the rest of the scattered X-Men. They raided the Evolutionary's satellite, disabled the mutation field and defeated Sinister, who had been manipulating the Evolutionary.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #379. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''X-Men (Vol 2)'' #99. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #380. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIceman was recruited by the living ship [[Prosh (Marvel Comics)|Prosh]], along with other mutants, like Jean Grey, Mystique, Toad and Juggernaut, to preserve evolution and save it. In this journey Iceman developed his powers even further, which led him to no longer be afraid of the natural course of his powers and he returned to the X-Men.<ref>''X-Men Forever'' #1\u20135. Marvel Comics.</ref> He joined a new team of X-Men, consisting of Angel, [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], Wolverine and Chamber. He was using his abilities in a whole new way now, just channeling the power and not turning his body into ice.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #395. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n====Second mutation====\n{{MOS|date=March 2015}}\nDuring a heated battle with a recently evolved [[Black Tom Cassidy]], he received a chest wound. After returning to normal his chest did not fully recover and some parts of it remained icy, and he was unable to return them to normal. At first he became afraid of it but in time it made him gain a new attitude in life, even rude at some times.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #413. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nNobody seemed to realize it at the time, but evidently this was an early sign of Iceman undergoing a secondary mutation of his own. When he repeatedly tried to evade his regular medical check-ups, school nurse [[Annie Ghazikhanian]] recognized that something odd was going on with him and pressured him to show her the wound. Bobby made her promise not to tell anyone and showed her that parts of his chest are now made of ice and he is unable to change them back to flesh and blood. Iceman wonders if he will entirely turn into ice on a permanent basis.<ref name=\"Uncanny X-Men #415\">''Uncanny X-Men'' #415. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nHe developed an attitude that, to some of the newer addition to the X-Men, like [[Stacy X]], [[Juggernaut (Marvel Comics)|Juggernaut]] and [[Northstar (Marvel Comics)|Northstar]], he comes across as rather arrogant, denouncing their status as team members, as they have not been around as long as he. Iceman even went as far as offending [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] by claiming that only the original five, and no one else, has the right to call themselves an X-Man.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #420. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nBobby was further frustrated when Havok and Polaris announced their imminent wedding, him having carried a torch for Lorna for quite some time. In his frustration he turned to Annie, who had problems with the wedding too, as she was secretly in love with Havok. The nurse surprised him with the accusation of him being a racist \u2013 feeling comfortable as a mutant who could pass like a human when needed, opposed to being a fully obvious mutant or a \"mere\" human. With his secondary mutation manifesting, though, Iceman was in danger of losing this status. Shocked by the truth of her words, Bobby fully opened up about his fears, that as a man fully made of ice he could never feel the warmth of a physical relationship again. Touched, Annie allowed him to kiss her, but when Havok called off the wedding, wanting to be with Annie instead, she quickly dumped Bobby.<ref name=\"Uncanny X-Men #426\">''Uncanny X-Men'' #426. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nUpon encountering [[Azazel (Marvel Comics)|Azazel]] and his followers, Iceman's body is shattered from the neck down. Afterward, he regains his entire ice form, but cannot change back to his human appearance. As a result, Bobby becomes both bitter and despondent because of this drastic change.<ref name=\"Uncanny X-Men #429\">''Uncanny X-Men'' #429. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n====Rogue's Team====\nIceman joins [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]]'s team after she tells him that she wants him as a member.{{issue|date=March 2018}} Their first mission as a team is to fight a new threat, a powerful group known as the [[Children of the Vault]].<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #188 (July 2006). Marvel Comics.</ref> The team is successful and during this time, Bobby learns that he can be completely destroyed but then pull himself back together again. It was shown several times during the arc.\n\nThe next mission for the team was to locate a man called Pandemic and defeat him. The team was again successful, but Rogue was infected with a virus called Strain 88. [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] took the team, including Bobby, to his island so Rogue could get treatment.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #s 194\u2013197. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWhile on Cable's island, the team and Iceman began working to defeat the [[Shi'ar]] weapon known as the Hecatomb. During the chaos, he shared a passionate kiss with [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]].<ref name=\"X-Men vol. 2 #190\">''X-Men'' vol. 2 #190. Marvel Comics.</ref> Even as he did so, he saved many lives by containing the explosion of the Conquistador, and, later, the Hecatomb itself.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #199. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n====Blinded by the Light====\nAs the team recovers from Hecatomb attack in Rogue's childhood home, it appears that Mystique and Iceman begin a romantic relationship.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #200. Marvel Comics.</ref> This was a front, as Mystique was using Iceman and the X-Men as a [[Marauders (comics)|Marauder]] spy for [[Mister Sinister]].<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #201. Marvel Comics.</ref> Marauders soon infiltrated the house; they attempt to gain access to [[Destiny (Irene Adler)#The Books of Truth|Destiny's Diaries]] on the order of Mr. Sinister (who has been gathering information about the future from anybody and anything that could foretell the future). Bobby and [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]] escape from the Marauders in the [[Blackbird (comics)|X-Jet]], with help from [[Emma Frost]]. They are pursued by [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]]; they manage to get the better of him and take him prisoner, but not before he manages to cripple the jet. While Sunfire is unconscious, Iceman and Sam discuss the Mauraders' plan to eliminate all precognitive mutants and anyone with knowledge of the future as well as retrieving Destiny's Diaries before the Marauders can. During this time, Bobby displayed sub-atomic control of energy transfers when he prevented Sunfire from using his fire-based powers.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #202. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nCannonball and Bobby, telepathically prompted by Emma Frost, attempt to recover the diaries which are hidden in a dilapidated brewery. Mr. Sinister uses the reverse-engineered version of Xavier's [[Cerebro]] to track the pair of X-Men to the brewery. The Marauders attack Cannonball and Iceman and overtake them. Bobby, while in his ice form, suffers a gunshot wound from Mystique, which severs one of his arms above the elbow. Mister Sinister, who takes Cannonball prisoner, attempts to telepathically erase his mind so that the X-Men will find him as an empty shell.  Iceman attacks Sinister, distracting him, which allows both of the X-Men to escape.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #203. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n====Messiah Complex====\n{{Main|X-Men: Messiah Complex}}\nThe [[New X-Men]] team decided to raid the headquarters of the [[Purifiers (Marvel Comics)|Purifiers]] in Washington, D.C., but were forced to retreat. [[Pixie (X-Men)|Pixie]] teleported them back to the mansion in a rush, but the entire team was scattered between D.C. and Westchester. Iceman, after recovering from his injuries, volunteered to go look for them and was given telepathic directions by [[Emma Frost]].<ref>''New X-Men'' #45. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIceman was successful in finding the New X-Men, most of them injured.  On the way back, they found that the [[Sentinel Squad O*N*E|O*N*E* Sentinels]] guarding the [[Xavier Institute for Higher Learning|Xavier Institute]] had become infected by nano-Sentinels and attacked the school. Iceman and New X-Man [[X-23]] helped out in the battle with the O*N*E* Sentinels.  With the help of [[Dust (comics)|Dust]] and X-23, the X-Men were able to survive this battle but the nano-Sentinel infected human escaped.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #493. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nSoon, Iceman participated in the final battle against the Marauders, the [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]], and [[Predator X (Marvel Comics)|Predator X]]. He was one of the X-Men who came running in to fight Predator X after it swallowed [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] whole. However, he also witnesses his mentor, Professor Xavier, \"killed\" by Bishop's bullet, which was not meant for him.<ref>''X-Men'' #207. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n====Divided We Stand====\n{{Main|X-Men: Divided We Stand}}\nIceman arrives in [[San Francisco]], where he was set to meet [[Hepzibah (comics)|Hepzibah]], [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]], and Angel. All four are caught in the effects of a citywide illusion created by [[Mastermind (Martinique Jason)|Martinique Jason]], who used her powers to transform the city into a hippie paradise.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #495. Marvel Comics.</ref> Now calling himself \"Frosty\", he and the others are sent by Martinique to confront Scott Summers and Emma Frost.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #498.

Marvel Comics.</ref> Iceman had the labor of providing water to the population. He attempted to use humor to keep everyone's spirits up even though he believed that the situation was helpless and that the X-Men were living in the last days of mutantkind. Bobby then helped defeat Predator X and also helped stop Selene's resurrected army's invasion of Utopia.{{Issue|date=May 2011}}\n\n====Second Coming====\nDuring the battle with Bastion's Nimrod Sentinels, Iceman is severely injured following an attack from one of them that reversed his ice form and left him with burns on his body.<ref>''X-Force'' #27.

However, Iceman is not one of the few heroes who were part of [[Fantastic Four]]'s expanded members, when one of the original four, [[Human Torch]] noticed his presence during the battle. Iceman claims that he was with the Fantastic Four in an \"untold story\" during the Atlantean's past invasion led by Namor, but Human Torch replies that story Iceman made-up was \"not-canon\".<ref>Fantastic Four (2018) #2 \u2013 #4</ref>\n\n====Solo series====\nAfter being outed as gay by the time-displaced [[Jean Grey]], the younger time-displaced Iceman confronts his older self, asking him why he has been presenting as straight for most of his adult life. The older Bobby breaks down and admits that he has known he was gay for a long time but forcibly repressed that part of himself, fearful of how others would react. He further acknowledges that he was scared to reveal his true self to the world due to already facing prejudice for being a mutant and not wanting to receive hatred for another part of himself.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men #600''</ref> Following all of this, Bobby decides to take a break from the limelight and focus on himself, declining to join the [[X-Men Gold|new X-team]] formed by [[Kitty Pryde]], instead acting as a reserve member and teaching classes at the Xavier School. After a training session with his younger self, Bobby sees the time-displaced Iceman head out for a date with his boyfriend Romeo while he tries to set up an online dating profile to meet guys. He receives a text from his mother stating that his father has had a heart attack so Bobby rushes to the hospital only to be chastises by his father for missing family events due to his commitments as a superhero. Following a brief battle in the hospital, Bobby's parents ask him to leave, angry that their mutant son is bringing yet more trouble into their lives.<ref>''Iceman'' #1</ref> On a mission with Kitty to rescue a new mutant, she confronts Bobby about being gay, asking why he could not tell her himself, meaning she had to find out from a secondary source. She reassures him that she only wants to help him and lets him know she is there if he ever wants to talk but suggests he should come out to his parents. Bobby arranges dinner with his family but he is constantly subjected anti-mutant rhetoric from his parents. The dinner is interrupted by a gang of [[Purifiers (Marvel Comics)|Purifiers]] but, although Iceman takes them down quickly and the lives of his parents, they are angry that their house has been destroyed because of him and send him away (although his mother promises to try and convince his father to visit him at the X-Mansion.<ref>''Iceman'' #2\u20133</ref> When the mutant that he and Kitty rescues goes missing, Iceman tracks him to a nearby nightclub where he discovers that [[Daken]] is responsible for luring him away. Daken tries to flirt with Bobby to distract him but Iceman freezes him and attempts to convince the mutant to return to the Xavier School, though he refuses. Daken mocks Bobby, saying that he can smell his fear and insecurity. Upon returning, Kitty surprises Bobby by revealing that his parents have arrived for a visit. He tells them he is gay and they both react negatively, angry that their son is both a mutant and a gay man. They chastise him for letting everyone else find out before them and try to convince him that he is straight, due to having been with women in the past. The family argument is interrupted by [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]], who attacks the school looking for the [[X-Men Blue|young X-Men]].

Bobby runs into a guy, Judah, while out shopping and he agrees to meet him that night at a local gay bar, with the rest of the Champions acting as his wingmen. The date appears to be going well but is interrupted by an attack by some [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]].<ref>''Iceman'' #6</ref> Bobby's relationship with Judah continues to develop and he decides to move to L.A. to be closer to him. While fighting [[Pyro (Marvel Comics)|Pyro]] with his younger self, Bobby explains that his mother has finally made contact with him for the first time since he came out and that she wants to invite both of them to dinner. Time-displaced Iceman agrees on the condition that Bobby tries to talk sense into Romeo, who hasn't called him in weeks. Meanwhile, Daken begins training his new mutant prot\u00e9g\u00e9e for a secret mission. When both the younger Bobby and the older Bobby arrive at the restaurant, their parents see the younger Bobby as a chance to raise a new son in a way that suits them but the time-displaced Iceman refuses, saying that he is still gay and wants to live life on his own terms before they both storm out.<ref>''Iceman'' #8</ref> During Bobby's moving away party at the X-Mansion, Daken uses the Purifiers to distract the other X-Men while he and his apprentice infiltrate the school and ambush Bobby. The young mutant uses his levelled-up powers to increase Daken's strength by turning him into [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse's]] horseman Death and he mortally wounds Judah with his claws before engaging Iceman in combat. Bobby manages to defeat Daken with a kiss which freezes Death's powers but Daken escapes and Judah breaks up with Bobby because his life is too much for him to deal with.<ref>''Iceman'' #10</ref>\n\nAfter teaming with [[Bishop (X-Men)|Bishop]] to help the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]] who came under threat by [[Mister Sinister]], Bobby finds himself approached by [[Emma Frost]] who asks him for his help. Ignoring Kitty's protests, he agrees and Emma explains that her Father, who subjected her brother Christian to conversion therapy before having him institutionalized, has recently let him out and reinstalled him as the new heir to the Frost business empire. When they arrive, they discover that Christian has murdered their Father and is exhibiting his own powers.

Ice Wizard warns Bobby that he must quit the X-Men and stop using his powers to avoid a world-destroying series of events happening. He explains that Daken seduces him and manipulates him into sacrificing the other X-Men before betraying him and gaining [[Thanos]]-level powers. Bobby is adamant that this won't happen and the two engage in battle. [[Jean Grey]] arrives and Bobby finally confronts her for the actions of her younger self when she outed him. Bobby explains to Ice Wizard that he is going to live life on his terms and that nobody, not even his future self, is going to decide for him. Bobby returns to his birthday celebration where Christian arrives and hands him a large sum of money which Bobby gives to the Morlocks.

Art by [[Walt Simonson]].]]\nIceman possesses the power to instantly decrease the temperature of ambient [[water vapor]] in his immediate environment to below zero degrees Celsius, thereby freezing it into ice. He is able to make ice that will not break unless he wills it to. In this manner he is able to quickly form a great variety of ice structures, including projectiles, shields, ladders, baseball bats, etc. Iceman often makes ice slides which form rapidly beneath and behind his feet, moving him along the slick surface at high speeds.  He is also able to form exceedingly complicated structures within relative short time, such as miniature cities.<ref name=\"Uncanny319\">''Uncanny X-Men'' #319. Marvel Comics.</ref> Originally, Iceman's own body temperature would lower dramatically when his powers were active, reaching {{convert|-105|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} within a few tenths of a second (now his body usually converts to organic ice; see below).  Iceman is immune to sub-zero temperatures; he is also able to perceive the [[thermal energy]] level of objects around him. Because [[cold]] is the absence of heat, Iceman does not actually 'emanate' cold; rather, he decreases thermal energy. As mentioned by writer [[Mike Carey (writer)|Mike Carey]], Iceman is \"an [[Omega-level mutant]]&nbsp;... [and] has powers that can influence the ecosystem of the entire world.\"<ref name=\"Carey\"/> Iceman has yet to tap into his full mutant potential, but over the years he has taken more interest in developing his abilities.{{issue|date=May 2015}}\n\nIn his early appearances, Iceman generally covered his body in a thick layer of what appeared to be snow; hence he looked more like a traditional snowman than an ice-man. Upon further training in the use of his powers, he was able to fashion an armor of solid ice around his body when using his powers, which afforded him some degree of protection against concussive force and projectiles. Later on, he manifested the ability to convert the tissue of his body into organic ice. He sometimes augments his organic ice form with razor sharp adornments to his shoulders, elbows, knees, and fists. Iceman has also been able to move rapidly to another distant location while in his organic ice form, being able to deposit his bodily mass into a river and reconstitute his entire mass a great distance away in a matter of minutes (by temporarily merging his molecules with those of the river). On one occasion, Iceman suffered a severe chest injury while in his ice form and was able to heal himself by converting back into his normal human form.{{Issue|date=February 2011}}\n\nIceman is also able to reconstitute his organic ice form if any part of it is damaged, or even if it is completely shattered, without permanently harming himself. He can temporarily add the mass of a body of water to his own, increasing his mass, size, and strength. He can survive not only as ice, but as liquid water and water vapor. He can also transform his body from a gaseous state back to a solid, although it is physically and mentally taxing.<ref name=\"X-Men vol. 2 #190\"/><ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #193. Marvel Comics.</ref> Iceman can also freeze sea water, as seen during the \"[[Operation: Zero Tolerance]]\" [[story arc]]. While he usually does not use his powers in lethal ways, his powers are so vast that they extend to the molecular level, to the point that he can freeze all of the molecules of an object/being with a thought; he once froze every single molecule of water within the body of [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|David Haller]].<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #41. Marvel Comics.</ref> Iceman is also able to dissolve his own icy constructs.<ref name=\"Uncanny319\"/>\n\nIceman's powers were pushed to their limit while possessed by Emma Frost, who used Iceman to discover the fate of her [[Hellions (Marvel Comics)|Hellions]].  During this time Iceman was able to control all forms of moisture, freeze fluids inside people's bodies, travel as a liquid, solid or gas. Not even the combined might of the X-Men Gold team was able to stop Emma Frost in Iceman's body.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #313\u2013314. Marvel Comics.</ref> Following this, Bobby confronted Emma about how she was able to use his powers so effectively. While together they made some initial progress, she refused to train him further.<ref name=\"Uncanny X-Men #331\"/> Instead he turned to Storm because they share similar elemental powers and she agreed to tutor him.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #48. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWhen Iceman was injected with Mister Sinister's neuro-inhibiter by Mystique, he was able to save himself by drawing in all of the ambient moisture around him, rapidly replacing his poisoned cells with healthy material before the injection could kill him.<ref name=\"X-Men: Manifest Destiny #3\">''X-Men: Manifest Destiny'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring the 2013\u20132014 \"[[Battle of the Atom]]\" storyline, Iceman's future self revealed that he has the ability to create semi-independent ice structures that can act on their own,<ref name=\"WolX37\">''Wolverine and the X-Men'' #37.

Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAside from his superhuman powers, Iceman is also a fair hand-to-hand combatant, and received combat training at Xavier's School as well as coaching from the [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]] and [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] while serving with the [[Champions (1975 team)|Champions of Los Angeles]]. Iceman has taken as much combat training as Cyclops or Beast.<ref name=\"Carey\">Richards, Dave (28 August 2008).

[[Comic Book Resources]].</ref>\n\n==Characterization==\n\n===Personality===\nAccording to writer Mike Carey \"one of Iceman's best personality traits is that emotionally Bobby Drake is like the ice he manipulates\u2014not cold but transparent. 'He's devastatingly honest. He is very up-front with his emotions and his thoughts all the time.'\"<ref name=\"Carey\"/> \"Also, he's obviously incredibly brave both in terms of facing external, physical danger as well as facing up to unpleasant situations and admitting his own mistakes.\"<ref name=\"Carey\"/>\n\n===Friendships and relationships===\nIceman had a brief relationship with a Japanese-American New Yorker named Opal Tanaka. He subsequently exhibited strong feelings for his fellow X-Man [[Polaris (Marvel Comics)|Polaris]], but she did not return those feelings, due to her feelings towards Havok. [[Northstar (Marvel Comics)|Northstar]] developed an unrequited crush for Iceman during their time on the same team, though Iceman never did find out about this.<ref name=\"Uncanny X-Men #415\"/> Iceman later had a brief relationship with the Xavier School's nurse, Annie, but she eventually left him for Havok, who had just left Polaris at the altar.<ref name=\"Uncanny X-Men #426\"/> When Iceman attempted to rekindle his relationship with Polaris, that too ended abruptly, and Polaris returned to Havok.<ref name=\"Uncanny X-Men #429\"/> Iceman then had a relationship with the X-Men's enemy Mystique, who later betrayed him, despite her continued fixation on him, in as much as she stated that she would either kill him or cure him of his personal uncertainty.<ref name=\"X-Men: Manifest Destiny #3\"/>\n\nIceman has long-lasting friendships with [[Spider-Man]], [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)|Firestar]] and the [[Human Torch]].\n\n===Sexuality===\nIn ''All-New X-Men'' #40, the time-displaced Iceman is revealed to be gay, which eventually forces the youth to confront the adult version of himself about the matter. As both speak, the adult Iceman confirms the fact and that he had put all his energy into just being an X-Man as he couldn't cope with being a mutant and gay simultaneously. With the help of his younger self and Jean Grey, however, he finally comes to terms with his own sexuality,<ref name=\"Uncanny X-Men #600\"/> and comes out to fellow gay X-Man [[Anole (comics)|Anole]] in ''Extraordinary X-Men'' #6. The end of the Extermination X-Men event saw the redirecting of the time displaced version of Bobby back into the \"closet\" when he returned to his original timeline alongside the other X-Men, due to a mind lock by Jean Grey, even though the current version retains his memories and remains an out gay man.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/extermination-x-men-breakdown/|title=Extermination: Every Major Change Made to the X-Men|date=28 December 2018|website=CBR}}</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===1602===\nIceman is Roberto Trefusis in the miniseries ''[[Marvel 1602]]'', a member of the group of \"witchbreeds\" founded by [[Carlos Javier]] and led by [[Alternative versions of Cyclops#1602|Scotius Summerisle]]. He is the nephew of naval commander [[Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake]]. As in the Marvel Universe, he generates ice and can assume a physical ice form.\n\n===\"Age of Apocalypse\"===\n{{Main|Age of Apocalypse}}\nIn the \"[[Age of Apocalypse]]\" storyline, Bobby, along with the rest of the X-Men, is trained by [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)#Age of Apocalypse|Magneto]].<ref>''X-Men Chronicles'' #1 (1995). Marvel Comics.</ref> Because Magneto is harder on his students than [[Professor X]], Bobby lacks his 616-counterpart's sense of humor.  Instead, Bobby becomes very cold and inhuman, making his teammates feel uncomfortable. In addition to his normal abilities, Bobby is capable of breaking down his body and merging it with another body of water to travel great distances in a matter of seconds. He can bring others along through a process that he calls \"moisture [[Molecule|molecular]] inversion\", though it is a painful process for the passengers. Bobby is also able to reconstitute his body from broken pieces. Just before Apocalypse's defeat, Colossus stormed right through Iceman, causing him to fall into pieces in an attempt to reach his sister.{{issue|date=May 2012}} A couple of months later, Iceman, [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]], [[Wild Child (comics)|Wild Child]], and [[Kevin Sydney|Morph]] were sent on a secret mission by Magneto; for a time, only Wild Child's fate was revealed.{{issue|date=May 2012}}\n\nIceman returned in the ''[[Uncanny X-Force]]'' arc \"The Dark Angel Saga\", when the title team was forced to travel to the AoA reality.<ref name=\"auto\"/> He abandoned the X-Men during a battle with the minions of Weapon X, who had by this time been transformed into that world's new Apocalypse, a defection later revealed to be the result of Iceman's having lost faith in his X-Men's ability to save their world. He was soon brought to Earth-616 by the Dark Beast, where he joined forces with Archangel on his quest to eradicate all life on Earth so he could create a new evolution process.{{issue|date=December 2011}} Tired of seeing the people he cared about being killed fighting what he thought to be an unwinnable war, Drake agreed to help Archangel \u2013 despite the latter's now being the mainstream Marvel Universe's version of Drake's X-Men's arch-enemy, Apocalypse \u2013 in exchange for transport to the relative paradise that was Earth-616.{{issue|date=October 2012}}\n\nAfter X-Force defeated Archangel, Bobby managed to escape with McCoy and most of Archangel's other minions, but eventually broke away from them and went into hiding, living a life of hedonistic bliss in [[Madripoor]]. The \"Age of Apocalypse\" version of Nightcrawler \u2013 who, after being brought to Earth-616 along with the rest of his world's X-Men to help take down Archangel, decided to stay behind there in order to track down and kill the various villains who also came to the mainstream Marvel Universe \u2013 eventually tracked Bobby down to execute him for his treason. Nightcrawler is quickly overwhelmed by Drake's avatars, but eventually forces Iceman into a factory boiler room, where there's not enough moisture in the air for him to effectively use his powers. Nightcrawler quickly disables his former friend, and shoves him into an incinerator, killing the once noble hero.{{issue|date=May 2012}}\n\n===''Earth X''===\nDuring the miniseries ''[[Earth X]]'', Bobby had become trapped in his ice form, making him vulnerable to melting.  He moves to the [[Arctic]] regions of Earth, and made an ice city for himself and the [[Inuit]].

Despite this, he retains a jovial and optimistic personality. When Havok has a disagreement with [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] and decides to leave the X-Men, Ice-Man is one of those who follow him, becoming a founding member of the Six, who eventually come to be considered the world's premiere mutant team.<ref>''Mutant X'' #1 (October 1998).

Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===\"Battle of the Atom\"===\nIn the alternate future witnessed in the \"[[Battle of the Atom]]\" storyline, Iceman's had truly evolved to become Sir Robert, the wizard-like Icemaster. As one of the most respected X-Men, he had incredible control over his powers and could even grow a beard! Though never outright mentioned, he may had a relationship with Kitty Pryde and even fathered a son with her, denoting the existence of Carmen Drake, a boy with the powers of both Iceman and Shadowcat.<ref>''Wolverine and the X-Men'' #29</ref> He has also developed the ability to create semi-independent ice structures that can act on their own, although one of these structures, possessing a Hulk-like physique and intellect, has gone on to join the future version of the Brotherhood, resulting in the Brotherhood using the duplicate to reinforce the illusion of themselves as the future X-Men. The duplicate Iceman was defeated by the O5 Iceman, the present Iceman, and the future Iceman during the battle in the past (Prompting the youngest Iceman to note that they only needed one more Iceman for a five-a-side basketball team).<ref name=\"WolX37\"/>\n\nIcemaster later returned to the mainstream marvel universe and confronts Iceman about trusts and decisions. He does it in order to prevent him from doing the same mistakes Icemaster did in the future. Knowing he had little time left, Icemaster eventually revealed to Iceman that after beginning a relationship with Daken, they both led the X-Men to space in order to prevent the Shi'ar from overwhelm the Earth and lay waste to it. However Icemaster would discover that Daken's plan was actually to obtain the M'Kraan Crystal in the first place, killing in the process the other X-Men and later Deathbird herself. Icemaster attempts to stop Daken, but he is seconds too late as having the Nexus of all Realities made Daken a Thanos-level player in the cosmos, and he acted as such. Icemaster eventually became convinced, after seeing Bobby's character growth, that his present self had matured beyond what he remembered, leaving the future open for new decisions to be made. With his mission apparently completed, Icemaster turns into thin air soon afterwards.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men: Winter's End'' #1</ref>\n\n===Ronin===\nIn the alternate reality of ''X-Men: Ronin'' Iceman is a murderous ninja in the employ of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]].

Iceman journeys back in time and meets his parents before he was born, and battles Oblivion and Mirage. He then reconciles with his parents.<ref>''Iceman'' #1\u20134. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n====X-Factor====\nThe original X-Men, including Iceman, reunite to form the superhero team [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]].<ref>''X-Factor'' #1 (February 1986). Marvel Comics.</ref> With this new team, he encounters [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] for the first time.<ref>''X-Factor'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring his time with the team, [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] captures Bobby, hoping to use him to gain control over the [[Giants (Marvel Comics)|Frost Giants]]. Loki enhances Bobby's powers and then extracts them to restore the size of the [[Giants (Marvel Comics)|Frost Giants]]. Iceman is rescued by [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].<ref>''Thor'' #377\u2013378. Marvel Comics.</ref> Loki's tampering increases Bobby's powers to such an extent that he begins to lose control of his abilities. During a later battle with the [[The Right (comics)|Right]], he is fitted with a power-dampening belt which actually helps him control his abilities. Once able only to sheathe his own body in a protective coating of ice, Bobby finds he can encase the entirety of the [[Empire State Building]]. With time, Bobby gains sufficient control over his augmented powers and is able to stop using the inhibitor belt. Believing he has achieved his full potential, Bobby does not attempt to develop his abilities further.\n\nWith X-Factor, Bobby then defeats [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|Apocalypse's Horsemen]].<ref>''X-Factor'' #19. Marvel Comics.</ref> Iceman helps watch over many of the younger superheroes, something he once was. Most notably, he and Beast help [[Tabitha Smith|Boom Boom]] gain a more normal life. For a brief while, he also helps supervise the [[New Mutants]] and their sister team, the [[X-Terminators]]. They, in turn, save him from the deadly kiss of [[Infectia]].<ref>''X-Factor'' #29\u201331. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nBobby also develops a romantic relationship with [[Opal Tanaka]].

Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nOne day he took Opal to eat with his parents, however his dad began humiliating her because of her Japanese heritage. The four are attacked by the Cyber-Samurai, which added to William Drake's prejudices about the girl.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #289. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Bobby came across [[Mikhail Rasputin]] he used his mutant abilities on him. Bobby discovered that his potential was still far from being reached as he converted his body into ice, not just covered by it.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #292. Marvel Comics.</ref> By turning his entire body to ice, instead of just wearing an icy exterior, Bobby now was capable of using his power in new, aggressive ways, adding spikes and padding to his ice structure.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #300. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nToo busy with the many threats that the X-Men faced every day, Bobby let his relationship with Opal deteriorate and, when they finally saw each other again after weeks, it was only to save her from an attack by mutant haters. Annoyed that she could only gain his attention by nearly getting killed, Opal broke off their relationship.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #305. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nLater, as he was checking on [[Emma Frost]] who was in a comatose state after the mutant [[Trevor Fitzroy]] unleashed the mutant-hunting Sentinels on Emma Frost and her students known as the [[Hellions (Marvel Comics)|Hellions]], the mansion was hit by an electricity breakdown.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #311. Marvel Comics.</ref> Emma woke up disoriented, possessed Bobby's mind, and used his powers in ways Bobby never had; she froze an entire river and traveled through water. She was looking for her pupils but after finding out they were dead, she left Bobby's body.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #314. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nBobby invites Rogue to tag along on a visit to his parents. Wrongly assuming a romantic relation, his father disapproves of Rogue, verbally attacking them with the same prejudices he expressed with Opal. This time, Bobby had enough and left after telling his father that he should just accept the fact that he is a mutant and he would never fit the definition he has of normal. He was upset that Emma exhibited greater control of his powers than he had. Since Rogue was having problems with Gambit, the two of them go on a road trip to ease their minds.<ref name=\"Uncanny319\"/>\n\nDuring the Legion Quest, Iceman was one of the X-Men who went back in time to stop [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|Legion]] from killing Magneto. They succeed, but only partially. Legion does not kill Magneto, but instead accidentally murdered Xavier, his own father, years before Legion had been conceived much less born. This paradox caused the events of the [[Age of Apocalypse]]. At the last moment before the original reality ended, Iceman's fellow X-Men, Rogue and Gambit shared a kiss. When reality resumed, Rogue's mind-absorbing touch renders Gambit comatose. Having absorbed some secret haunting memories, she needs to get away from the X-Men and Iceman volunteers to join her on a road trip, though at the same time he was starting to see visions of Emma Frost. When Gambit awoke from his coma, he tracked them down and confronted Rogue about what she saw in his mind. She broke off their relationship, Iceman and Gambit returned to the X-Men.<ref>''X-Men (2nd series)'' #45. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWhen the entity known as [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] first appeared, Iceman was chosen as one of his test subjects, along with Storm, Cyclops and Wolverine. They were pitted against a servant of Onslaught named [[Post (comics)|Post]], in a specific battle area of harsh environment to test the extent of their abilities. They won and were returned to the mansion. However, Iceman's chest had been shattered in his ice form during battle, making it impossible to change back to human form.<ref>''X-Men'' (Vol 2) #50. Marvel Comics.</ref> He confronted Emma Frost and demanded to know what she did to his powers in his body and how to save himself. She refused to help since she knew that Bobby would have to do it himself. When he captured her with his ice powers, she telepathically showed him his insecurities. By confronting Opal and his father in her simulation, Iceman realized that Emma was right and managed to transform back to his human body with his chest fully intact.<ref name=\"Uncanny X-Men #331\">''Uncanny X-Men'' #331. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWhen Graydon Creed was running for President (with a heavy anti mutant campaign), Bobby was chosen to infiltrate in the campaign. His father stood out in a crowd and spoke in favor of the mutants, which came as a surprise to Bobby. His father's connection with Bobby was discovered, so the people that worked for Graydon captured him and almost beat him to death. Bobby decided to stay away from the X-Men for a while to be with his dad.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #340. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nZero Tolerance came across and Bobby found and helped Cecilia Reyes who was trying to keep a secret that she was a mutant. They also joined with Charlotte Jones and the morlock Marrow. After Bastion was defeated, he took Cecilia and Marrow to the mansion, and soon left the X-Men again for a while to be with his parents.<ref>''X-Men (Vol 2)'' #69. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nMuch later, the X-Men found evidence in one of Destiny's journals of a group known as the Twelve, including Xavier, Magneto, Cyclops, Phoenix, Iceman, Polaris, Storm, Cable, Bishop, Sunfire, Mikhail Rasputin and the [[Living Monolith]]. They also learned that the Apocalypse's Horsemen had been kidnapping these mutants from around the globe. Iceman was captured in the woods near his home by Deathbird, who had become the Horseman War.<ref>''X-Men'' (2nd series) #96. Marvel Comics.</ref> Gathering the remaining Twelve, the X-Men traveled to Egypt and confronted Apocalypse and the Skrulls. Apocalypse and his forces captured all of the Twelve during the battle, using them in a ritual to give the Chaos-Bringer a new body and incredible power. Magneto and Polaris created opposite magnetic polarities, Iceman, Storm, and Sunfire provided elemental extremes, Cyclops, Phoenix, and Cable gave the sheer power of family, Xavier represented the power of mind and Bishop and Mikhail stood for time and space, while the Monolith linked all their energies together. Nate Grey was to be Apocalypse's new host, a powerhouse to store his massive lifeforce. The Twelve managed to free themselves and Cyclops sacrificed his own body and life force to keep Apocalypse from getting Nate. Though the new Apocalypse was defeated, Cyclops seemed lost forever.<ref>''X-Men'' (Vol 2) #97. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAfter that incident, Iceman helped the Beast to secretly enter Genosha, as he wanted to study the legacy-infected mutates. When the High Evolutionary released his anti-mutation wave, they were trapped in the war-ravaged country. With the aid of Magneto, they escaped and joined forces with the rest of the scattered X-Men. They raided the Evolutionary's satellite, disabled the mutation field and defeated Sinister, who had been manipulating the Evolutionary.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #379. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''X-Men (Vol 2)'' #99. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #380. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIceman was recruited by the living ship [[Prosh (Marvel Comics)|Prosh]], along with other mutants, like Jean Grey, Mystique, Toad and Juggernaut, to preserve evolution and save it. In this journey Iceman developed his powers even further, which led him to no longer be afraid of the natural course of his powers and he returned to the X-Men.<ref>''X-Men Forever'' #1\u20135. Marvel Comics.</ref> He joined a new team of X-Men, consisting of Angel, [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], Wolverine and Chamber. He was using his abilities in a whole new way now, just channeling the power and not turning his body into ice.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #395. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n====Second mutation====\n{{MOS|date=March 2015}}\nDuring a heated battle with a recently evolved [[Black Tom Cassidy]], he received a chest wound. After returning to normal his chest did not fully recover and some parts of it remained icy, and he was unable to return them to normal. At first he became afraid of it but in time it made him gain a new attitude in life, even rude at some times.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #413. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nNobody seemed to realize it at the time, but evidently this was an early sign of Iceman undergoing a secondary mutation of his own. When he repeatedly tried to evade his regular medical check-ups, school nurse [[Annie Ghazikhanian]] recognized that something odd was going on with him and pressured him to show her the wound. Bobby made her promise not to tell anyone and showed her that parts of his chest are now made of ice and he is unable to change them back to flesh and blood. Iceman wonders if he will entirely turn into ice on a permanent basis.<ref name=\"Uncanny X-Men #415\">''Uncanny X-Men'' #415. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nHe developed an attitude that, to some of the newer addition to the X-Men, like [[Stacy X]], [[Juggernaut (Marvel Comics)|Juggernaut]] and [[Northstar (Marvel Comics)|Northstar]], he comes across as rather arrogant, denouncing their status as team members, as they have not been around as long as he. Iceman even went as far as offending [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] by claiming that only the original five, and no one else, has the right to call themselves an X-Man.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #420. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nBobby was further frustrated when Havok and Polaris announced their imminent wedding, him having carried a torch for Lorna for quite some time. In his frustration he turned to Annie, who had problems with the wedding too, as she was secretly in love with Havok. The nurse surprised him with the accusation of him being a racist \u2013 feeling comfortable as a mutant who could pass like a human when needed, opposed to being a fully obvious mutant or a \"mere\" human. With his secondary mutation manifesting, though, Iceman was in danger of losing this status. Shocked by the truth of her words, Bobby fully opened up about his fears, that as a man fully made of ice he could never feel the warmth of a physical relationship again. Touched, Annie allowed him to kiss her, but when Havok called off the wedding, wanting to be with Annie instead, she quickly dumped Bobby.<ref name=\"Uncanny X-Men #426\">''Uncanny X-Men'' #426. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nUpon encountering [[Azazel (Marvel Comics)|Azazel]] and his followers, Iceman's body is shattered from the neck down. Afterward, he regains his entire ice form, but cannot change back to his human appearance. As a result, Bobby becomes both bitter and despondent because of this drastic change.<ref name=\"Uncanny X-Men #429\">''Uncanny X-Men'' #429. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n====Rogue's Team====\nIceman joins [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]]'s team after she tells him that she wants him as a member.{{issue|date=March 2018}} Their first mission as a team is to fight a new threat, a powerful group known as the [[Children of the Vault]].<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #188 (July 2006). Marvel Comics.</ref> The team is successful and during this time, Bobby learns that he can be completely destroyed but then pull himself back together again. It was shown several times during the arc.\n\nThe next mission for the team was to locate a man called Pandemic and defeat him. The team was again successful, but Rogue was infected with a virus called Strain 88. [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] took the team, including Bobby, to his island so Rogue could get treatment.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #s 194\u2013197. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWhile on Cable's island, the team and Iceman began working to defeat the [[Shi'ar]] weapon known as the Hecatomb. During the chaos, he shared a passionate kiss with [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]].<ref name=\"X-Men vol. 2 #190\">''X-Men'' vol. 2 #190.

Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n====Blinded by the Light====\nAs the team recovers from Hecatomb attack in Rogue's childhood home, it appears that Mystique and Iceman begin a romantic relationship.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #200. Marvel Comics.</ref> This was a front, as Mystique was using Iceman and the X-Men as a [[Marauders (comics)|Marauder]] spy for [[Mister Sinister]].<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #201. Marvel Comics.</ref> Marauders soon infiltrated the house; they attempt to gain access to [[Destiny (Irene Adler)#The Books of Truth|Destiny's Diaries]] on the order of Mr. Sinister (who has been gathering information about the future from anybody and anything that could foretell the future). Bobby and [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]] escape from the Marauders in the [[Blackbird (comics)|X-Jet]], with help from [[Emma Frost]]. They are pursued by [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]]; they manage to get the better of him and take him prisoner, but not before he manages to cripple the jet. While Sunfire is unconscious, Iceman and Sam discuss the Mauraders' plan to eliminate all precognitive mutants and anyone with knowledge of the future as well as retrieving Destiny's Diaries before the Marauders can. During this time, Bobby displayed sub-atomic control of energy transfers when he prevented Sunfire from using his fire-based powers.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #202. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nCannonball and Bobby, telepathically prompted by Emma Frost, attempt to recover the diaries which are hidden in a dilapidated brewery. Mr. Sinister uses the reverse-engineered version of Xavier's [[Cerebro]] to track the pair of X-Men to the brewery. The Marauders attack Cannonball and Iceman and overtake them. Bobby, while in his ice form, suffers a gunshot wound from Mystique, which severs one of his arms above the elbow. Mister Sinister, who takes Cannonball prisoner, attempts to telepathically erase his mind so that the X-Men will find him as an empty shell.  Iceman attacks Sinister, distracting him, which allows both of the X-Men to escape.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #203. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n====Messiah Complex====\n{{Main|X-Men: Messiah Complex}}\nThe [[New X-Men]] team decided to raid the headquarters of the [[Purifiers (Marvel Comics)|Purifiers]] in Washington, D.C., but were forced to retreat. [[Pixie (X-Men)|Pixie]] teleported them back to the mansion in a rush, but the entire team was scattered between D.C. and Westchester. Iceman, after recovering from his injuries, volunteered to go look for them and was given telepathic directions by [[Emma Frost]].<ref>''New X-Men'' #45. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIceman was successful in finding the New X-Men, most of them injured.  On the way back, they found that the [[Sentinel Squad O*N*E|O*N*E* Sentinels]] guarding the [[Xavier Institute for Higher Learning|Xavier Institute]] had become infected by nano-Sentinels and attacked the school. Iceman and New X-Man [[X-23]] helped out in the battle with the O*N*E* Sentinels.  With the help of [[Dust (comics)|Dust]] and X-23, the X-Men were able to survive this battle but the nano-Sentinel infected human escaped.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #493. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nSoon, Iceman participated in the final battle against the Marauders, the [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]], and [[Predator X (Marvel Comics)|Predator X]]. He was one of the X-Men who came running in to fight Predator X after it swallowed [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] whole. However, he also witnesses his mentor, Professor Xavier, \"killed\" by Bishop's bullet, which was not meant for him.<ref>''X-Men'' #207. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n====Divided We Stand====\n{{Main|X-Men: Divided We Stand}}\nIceman arrives in [[San Francisco]], where he was set to meet [[Hepzibah (comics)|Hepzibah]], [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]], and Angel. All four are caught in the effects of a citywide illusion created by [[Mastermind (Martinique Jason)|Martinique Jason]], who used her powers to transform the city into a hippie paradise.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #495.

Marvel Comics.</ref> Iceman had the labor of providing water to the population. He attempted to use humor to keep everyone's spirits up even though he believed that the situation was helpless and that the X-Men were living in the last days of mutantkind. Bobby then helped defeat Predator X and also helped stop Selene's resurrected army's invasion of Utopia.{{Issue|date=May 2011}}\n\n====Second Coming====\nDuring the battle with Bastion's Nimrod Sentinels, Iceman is severely injured following an attack from one of them that reversed his ice form and left him with burns on his body.<ref>''X-Force'' #27.

However, Iceman is not one of the few heroes who were part of [[Fantastic Four]]'s expanded members, when one of the original four, [[Human Torch]] noticed his presence during the battle. Iceman claims that he was with the Fantastic Four in an \"untold story\" during the Atlantean's past invasion led by Namor, but Human Torch replies that story Iceman made-up was \"not-canon\".<ref>Fantastic Four (2018) #2 \u2013 #4</ref>\n\n====Solo series====\nAfter being outed as gay by the time-displaced [[Jean Grey]], the younger time-displaced Iceman confronts his older self, asking him why he has been presenting as straight for most of his adult life. The older Bobby breaks down and admits that he has known he was gay for a long time but forcibly repressed that part of himself, fearful of how others would react. He further acknowledges that he was scared to reveal his true self to the world due to already facing prejudice for being a mutant and not wanting to receive hatred for another part of himself.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men #600''</ref> Following all of this, Bobby decides to take a break from the limelight and focus on himself, declining to join the [[X-Men Gold|new X-team]] formed by [[Kitty Pryde]], instead acting as a reserve member and teaching classes at the Xavier School. After a training session with his younger self, Bobby sees the time-displaced Iceman head out for a date with his boyfriend Romeo while he tries to set up an online dating profile to meet guys. He receives a text from his mother stating that his father has had a heart attack so Bobby rushes to the hospital only to be chastises by his father for missing family events due to his commitments as a superhero. Following a brief battle in the hospital, Bobby's parents ask him to leave, angry that their mutant son is bringing yet more trouble into their lives.<ref>''Iceman'' #1</ref> On a mission with Kitty to rescue a new mutant, she confronts Bobby about being gay, asking why he could not tell her himself, meaning she had to find out from a secondary source. She reassures him that she only wants to help him and lets him know she is there if he ever wants to talk but suggests he should come out to his parents. Bobby arranges dinner with his family but he is constantly subjected anti-mutant rhetoric from his parents. The dinner is interrupted by a gang of [[Purifiers (Marvel Comics)|Purifiers]] but, although Iceman takes them down quickly and the lives of his parents, they are angry that their house has been destroyed because of him and send him away (although his mother promises to try and convince his father to visit him at the X-Mansion.<ref>''Iceman'' #2\u20133</ref> When the mutant that he and Kitty rescues goes missing, Iceman tracks him to a nearby nightclub where he discovers that [[Daken]] is responsible for luring him away. Daken tries to flirt with Bobby to distract him but Iceman freezes him and attempts to convince the mutant to return to the Xavier School, though he refuses. Daken mocks Bobby, saying that he can smell his fear and insecurity. Upon returning, Kitty surprises Bobby by revealing that his parents have arrived for a visit. He tells them he is gay and they both react negatively, angry that their son is both a mutant and a gay man. They chastise him for letting everyone else find out before them and try to convince him that he is straight, due to having been with women in the past. The family argument is interrupted by [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]], who attacks the school looking for the [[X-Men Blue|young X-Men]]. Iceman defeats him by pushing his powers and returns to the mansion to find his father is still there. He had obtained Bobby's draft of a coming out letter from Kitty and the two men begin to reconcile.<ref>''Iceman'' #4\u20135</ref>\n\nBobby reconnects with his former [[Champions (1975 team)|Champions]] teammates, [[Angel (comics)|Angel]], [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]], [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Ghost Rider]] and [[Darkstar (Marvel Comics)|Darkstar]], so they reminisce about their time with [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]]. Bobby runs into a guy, Judah, while out shopping and he agrees to meet him that night at a local gay bar, with the rest of the Champions acting as his wingmen. The date appears to be going well but is interrupted by an attack by some [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]].<ref>''Iceman'' #6</ref> Bobby's relationship with Judah continues to develop and he decides to move to L.A. to be closer to him. While fighting [[Pyro (Marvel Comics)|Pyro]] with his younger self, Bobby explains that his mother has finally made contact with him for the first time since he came out and that she wants to invite both of them to dinner. Time-displaced Iceman agrees on the condition that Bobby tries to talk sense into Romeo, who hasn't called him in weeks. Meanwhile, Daken begins training his new mutant prot\u00e9g\u00e9e for a secret mission. When both the younger Bobby and the older Bobby arrive at the restaurant, their parents see the younger Bobby as a chance to raise a new son in a way that suits them but the time-displaced Iceman refuses, saying that he is still gay and wants to live life on his own terms before they both storm out.<ref>''Iceman'' #8</ref> During Bobby's moving away party at the X-Mansion, Daken uses the Purifiers to distract the other X-Men while he and his apprentice infiltrate the school and ambush Bobby. The young mutant uses his levelled-up powers to increase Daken's strength by turning him into [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse's]] horseman Death and he mortally wounds Judah with his claws before engaging Iceman in combat. Bobby manages to defeat Daken with a kiss which freezes Death's powers but Daken escapes and Judah breaks up with Bobby because his life is too much for him to deal with.<ref>''Iceman'' #10</ref>\n\nAfter teaming with [[Bishop (X-Men)|Bishop]] to help the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]] who came under threat by [[Mister Sinister]], Bobby finds himself approached by [[Emma Frost]] who asks him for his help.

Art by [[Walt Simonson]].]]\nIceman possesses the power to instantly decrease the temperature of ambient [[water vapor]] in his immediate environment to below zero degrees Celsius, thereby freezing it into ice. He is able to make ice that will not break unless he wills it to. In this manner he is able to quickly form a great variety of ice structures, including projectiles, shields, ladders, baseball bats, etc. Iceman often makes ice slides which form rapidly beneath and behind his feet, moving him along the slick surface at high speeds.  He is also able to form exceedingly complicated structures within relative short time, such as miniature cities.<ref name=\"Uncanny319\">''Uncanny X-Men'' #319. Marvel Comics.</ref> Originally, Iceman's own body temperature would lower dramatically when his powers were active, reaching {{convert|-105|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} within a few tenths of a second (now his body usually converts to organic ice; see below).  Iceman is immune to sub-zero temperatures; he is also able to perceive the [[thermal energy]] level of objects around him. Because [[cold]] is the absence of heat, Iceman does not actually 'emanate' cold; rather, he decreases thermal energy. As mentioned by writer [[Mike Carey (writer)|Mike Carey]], Iceman is \"an [[Omega-level mutant]]&nbsp;... [and] has powers that can influence the ecosystem of the entire world.\"<ref name=\"Carey\"/> Iceman has yet to tap into his full mutant potential, but over the years he has taken more interest in developing his abilities.{{issue|date=May 2015}}\n\nIn his early appearances, Iceman generally covered his body in a thick layer of what appeared to be snow; hence he looked more like a traditional snowman than an ice-man. Upon further training in the use of his powers, he was able to fashion an armor of solid ice around his body when using his powers, which afforded him some degree of protection against concussive force and projectiles. Later on, he manifested the ability to convert the tissue of his body into organic ice. He sometimes augments his organic ice form with razor sharp adornments to his shoulders, elbows, knees, and fists. Iceman has also been able to move rapidly to another distant location while in his organic ice form, being able to deposit his bodily mass into a river and reconstitute his entire mass a great distance away in a matter of minutes (by temporarily merging his molecules with those of the river). On one occasion, Iceman suffered a severe chest injury while in his ice form and was able to heal himself by converting back into his normal human form.{{Issue|date=February 2011}}\n\nIceman is also able to reconstitute his organic ice form if any part of it is damaged, or even if it is completely shattered, without permanently harming himself. He can temporarily add the mass of a body of water to his own, increasing his mass, size, and strength. He can survive not only as ice, but as liquid water and water vapor. He can also transform his body from a gaseous state back to a solid, although it is physically and mentally taxing.<ref name=\"X-Men vol. 2 #190\"/><ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #193. Marvel Comics.</ref> Iceman can also freeze sea water, as seen during the \"[[Operation: Zero Tolerance]]\" [[story arc]]. While he usually does not use his powers in lethal ways, his powers are so vast that they extend to the molecular level, to the point that he can freeze all of the molecules of an object/being with a thought; he once froze every single molecule of water within the body of [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|David Haller]].<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #41. Marvel Comics.</ref> Iceman is also able to dissolve his own icy constructs.<ref name=\"Uncanny319\"/>\n\nIceman's powers were pushed to their limit while possessed by Emma Frost, who used Iceman to discover the fate of her [[Hellions (Marvel Comics)|Hellions]].  During this time Iceman was able to control all forms of moisture, freeze fluids inside people's bodies, travel as a liquid, solid or gas. Not even the combined might of the X-Men Gold team was able to stop Emma Frost in Iceman's body.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #313\u2013314. Marvel Comics.</ref> Following this, Bobby confronted Emma about how she was able to use his powers so effectively. While together they made some initial progress, she refused to train him further.<ref name=\"Uncanny X-Men #331\"/> Instead he turned to Storm because they share similar elemental powers and she agreed to tutor him.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #48. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWhen Iceman was injected with Mister Sinister's neuro-inhibiter by Mystique, he was able to save himself by drawing in all of the ambient moisture around him, rapidly replacing his poisoned cells with healthy material before the injection could kill him.<ref name=\"X-Men: Manifest Destiny #3\">''X-Men: Manifest Destiny'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring the 2013\u20132014 \"[[Battle of the Atom]]\" storyline, Iceman's future self revealed that he has the ability to create semi-independent ice structures that can act on their own,<ref name=\"WolX37\">''Wolverine and the X-Men'' #37.

[[Comic Book Resources]].</ref>\n\n==Characterization==\n\n===Personality===\nAccording to writer Mike Carey \"one of Iceman's best personality traits is that emotionally Bobby Drake is like the ice he manipulates\u2014not cold but transparent. 'He's devastatingly honest. He is very up-front with his emotions and his thoughts all the time.'\"<ref name=\"Carey\"/> \"Also, he's obviously incredibly brave both in terms of facing external, physical danger as well as facing up to unpleasant situations and admitting his own mistakes.\"<ref name=\"Carey\"/>\n\n===Friendships and relationships===\nIceman had a brief relationship with a Japanese-American New Yorker named Opal Tanaka. He subsequently exhibited strong feelings for his fellow X-Man [[Polaris (Marvel Comics)|Polaris]], but she did not return those feelings, due to her feelings towards Havok. [[Northstar (Marvel Comics)|Northstar]] developed an unrequited crush for Iceman during their time on the same team, though Iceman never did find out about this.<ref name=\"Uncanny X-Men #415\"/> Iceman later had a brief relationship with the Xavier School's nurse, Annie, but she eventually left him for Havok, who had just left Polaris at the altar.<ref name=\"Uncanny X-Men #426\"/> When Iceman attempted to rekindle his relationship with Polaris, that too ended abruptly, and Polaris returned to Havok.<ref name=\"Uncanny X-Men #429\"/> Iceman then had a relationship with the X-Men's enemy Mystique, who later betrayed him, despite her continued fixation on him, in as much as she stated that she would either kill him or cure him of his personal uncertainty.<ref name=\"X-Men: Manifest Destiny #3\"/>\n\nIceman has long-lasting friendships with [[Spider-Man]], [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)|Firestar]] and the [[Human Torch]].\n\n===Sexuality===\nIn ''All-New X-Men'' #40, the time-displaced Iceman is revealed to be gay, which eventually forces the youth to confront the adult version of himself about the matter. As both speak, the adult Iceman confirms the fact and that he had put all his energy into just being an X-Man as he couldn't cope with being a mutant and gay simultaneously. With the help of his younger self and Jean Grey, however, he finally comes to terms with his own sexuality,<ref name=\"Uncanny X-Men #600\"/> and comes out to fellow gay X-Man [[Anole (comics)|Anole]] in ''Extraordinary X-Men'' #6. The end of the Extermination X-Men event saw the redirecting of the time displaced version of Bobby back into the \"closet\" when he returned to his original timeline alongside the other X-Men, due to a mind lock by Jean Grey, even though the current version retains his memories and remains an out gay man.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/extermination-x-men-breakdown/|title=Extermination: Every Major Change Made to the X-Men|date=28 December 2018|website=CBR}}</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===1602===\nIceman is Roberto Trefusis in the miniseries ''[[Marvel 1602]]'', a member of the group of \"witchbreeds\" founded by [[Carlos Javier]] and led by [[Alternative versions of Cyclops#1602|Scotius Summerisle]].

Marvel Comics.</ref> Because Magneto is harder on his students than [[Professor X]], Bobby lacks his 616-counterpart's sense of humor.  Instead, Bobby becomes very cold and inhuman, making his teammates feel uncomfortable. In addition to his normal abilities, Bobby is capable of breaking down his body and merging it with another body of water to travel great distances in a matter of seconds. He can bring others along through a process that he calls \"moisture [[Molecule|molecular]] inversion\", though it is a painful process for the passengers. Bobby is also able to reconstitute his body from broken pieces. Just before Apocalypse's defeat, Colossus stormed right through Iceman, causing him to fall into pieces in an attempt to reach his sister.{{issue|date=May 2012}} A couple of months later, Iceman, [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]], [[Wild Child (comics)|Wild Child]], and [[Kevin Sydney|Morph]] were sent on a secret mission by Magneto; for a time, only Wild Child's fate was revealed.{{issue|date=May 2012}}\n\nIceman returned in the ''[[Uncanny X-Force]]'' arc \"The Dark Angel Saga\", when the title team was forced to travel to the AoA reality.<ref name=\"auto\"/> He abandoned the X-Men during a battle with the minions of Weapon X, who had by this time been transformed into that world's new Apocalypse, a defection later revealed to be the result of Iceman's having lost faith in his X-Men's ability to save their world. He was soon brought to Earth-616 by the Dark Beast, where he joined forces with Archangel on his quest to eradicate all life on Earth so he could create a new evolution process.{{issue|date=December 2011}} Tired of seeing the people he cared about being killed fighting what he thought to be an unwinnable war, Drake agreed to help Archangel \u2013 despite the latter's now being the mainstream Marvel Universe's version of Drake's X-Men's arch-enemy, Apocalypse \u2013 in exchange for transport to the relative paradise that was Earth-616.{{issue|date=October 2012}}\n\nAfter X-Force defeated Archangel, Bobby managed to escape with McCoy and most of Archangel's other minions, but eventually broke away from them and went into hiding, living a life of hedonistic bliss in [[Madripoor]]. The \"Age of Apocalypse\" version of Nightcrawler \u2013 who, after being brought to Earth-616 along with the rest of his world's X-Men to help take down Archangel, decided to stay behind there in order to track down and kill the various villains who also came to the mainstream Marvel Universe \u2013 eventually tracked Bobby down to execute him for his treason. Nightcrawler is quickly overwhelmed by Drake's avatars, but eventually forces Iceman into a factory boiler room, where there's not enough moisture in the air for him to effectively use his powers. Nightcrawler quickly disables his former friend, and shoves him into an incinerator, killing the once noble hero.{{issue|date=May 2012}}\n\n===''Earth X''===\nDuring the miniseries ''[[Earth X]]'', Bobby had become trapped in his ice form, making him vulnerable to melting.  He moves to the [[Arctic]] regions of Earth, and made an ice city for himself and the [[Inuit]].

Despite this, he retains a jovial and optimistic personality. When Havok has a disagreement with [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] and decides to leave the X-Men, Ice-Man is one of those who follow him, becoming a founding member of the Six, who eventually come to be considered the world's premiere mutant team.<ref>''Mutant X'' #1 (October 1998).

Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===\"Battle of the Atom\"===\nIn the alternate future witnessed in the \"[[Battle of the Atom]]\" storyline, Iceman's had truly evolved to become Sir Robert, the wizard-like Icemaster. As one of the most respected X-Men, he had incredible control over his powers and could even grow a beard! Though never outright mentioned, he may had a relationship with Kitty Pryde and even fathered a son with her, denoting the existence of Carmen Drake, a boy with the powers of both Iceman and Shadowcat.<ref>''Wolverine and the X-Men'' #29</ref> He has also developed the ability to create semi-independent ice structures that can act on their own, although one of these structures, possessing a Hulk-like physique and intellect, has gone on to join the future version of the Brotherhood, resulting in the Brotherhood using the duplicate to reinforce the illusion of themselves as the future X-Men. The duplicate Iceman was defeated by the O5 Iceman, the present Iceman, and the future Iceman during the battle in the past (Prompting the youngest Iceman to note that they only needed one more Iceman for a five-a-side basketball team).<ref name=\"WolX37\"/>\n\nIcemaster later returned to the mainstream marvel universe and confronts Iceman about trusts and decisions. He does it in order to prevent him from doing the same mistakes Icemaster did in the future. Knowing he had little time left, Icemaster eventually revealed to Iceman that after beginning a relationship with Daken, they both led the X-Men to space in order to prevent the Shi'ar from overwhelm the Earth and lay waste to it. However Icemaster would discover that Daken's plan was actually to obtain the M'Kraan Crystal in the first place, killing in the process the other X-Men and later Deathbird herself. Icemaster attempts to stop Daken, but he is seconds too late as having the Nexus of all Realities made Daken a Thanos-level player in the cosmos, and he acted as such. Icemaster eventually became convinced, after seeing Bobby's character growth, that his present self had matured beyond what he remembered, leaving the future open for new decisions to be made.

Being 18, Bobby had the choice to either stay at home or return to the X-Men and he made the choice to rejoin the team. Since he is still in his teens, he's shown at times acting like a typical teenage boy (such as his facial expression after [[Emma Frost]] walks by him in episode 3). He is also not fond of reading and is a bit lazy as he was napping on a pile of books instead of giving them to Kitty to put away. He apparently has a crush on Shadowcat, as he is caught staring at her dreamily before asking her out for a bite to eat (although they were already eating). It is also hinted she may share those feelings, as in episode 3 when Kitty elbows him for looking at Emma.

They are both accepted in the same college in Delhi, and after a series of adventures, soon become friends, forming part of a group of four.\nAkaash and Vani eventually fall in love and embark on a four-year relationship, which is kept secret from Vani's traditional parents.\n\nAs their final year comes to an end, Akaash decides to go to the UK for his further studies. Vani returns to her home town of Dehradun to attend her sister's wedding, after which she plans to study for an M.B.A. She tells her sister about her relationship with Akaash, but her sister reacts negatively, saying that their parents would not approve. The next day, amidst the wedding preparation, Vani finds out that her sister has eloped with another man, who she was in love with but was not accepted by her parents. Vani's parents are heartbroken and have to endure the shame of their neighbours and community. In the fear of society's response, they decide to get Vani married to the son of an acquaintance. Pressured by her parents and feeling guilt over her sister's actions, Vani reluctantly agrees. She emotionally ends things with Akaash via a phone call and requests him not to try and meet her. Akaash is devastated but slowly becomes bitter and detached with time.\n\nVani's husband Ravi ([[Sunny Nijar]]) is an arrogant, controlling man who rapes with her every night. Ravi is emotionally abusive and expects Vani to cater to his every need, but pretends to be a perfect husband in front of friends and family. He prevents her from going out, working or furthering her studies, and expects her to be a full-time housewife. After an argument, Vani returns home and reveals her unhappiness to her parents. However, they send her back to Ravi after he charms them, and ask him to consider starting a family in order to occupy Vani's time. Time goes by and Vani slowly begins losing self-confidence and becomes resigned to her fate. One day, Vani's aunt and uncle unexpectedly come to visit her and suggest that she go back with them for several days to Delhi, in order to attend her college reunion. Ravi is unhappy but reluctantly agrees, since he will also be away for some time on a business trip.\n\nAt the college, Vani reunites with her friends, who find her to be reserved and depressed. She also comes across Akaash, who is still bitter and hurt about their break up. He angrily confronts her and she runs away, deciding to return home that night. Her friends meet her at the train station and Akaash finally breaks down and cries, something which he has not allowed himself to do previously. Vani decides to stay. The group spend the week together, during which time they have fun and re-live their college memories. Vani tells Akaash the truth about her marriage but says that she cannot divorce Ravi because her parents won't be able to handle it, especially after her sister eloped. Akaash tells his friend that he hopes to reunite with Vani and plans to fill her days with adventures and happiness. He hopes that this will raise her spirits and give her the courage to leave Ravi. The group travel to Chandigarh where Akaash and Vani spend time alone together and rekindle their romance. The trip is cut short by a phone call from Vani's parents, requesting her to visit them. Conflicted, Vani chooses to return home and emotionally leaves her friends and Akaash behind.\n\nAkaash decides that he can't lose Vani once again and the group follows Vani to her home. They stay happily with Vani's parents until Ravi arrives there, too. Akaash observes the way Vani assumes the role of a subservient wife and how she is ill-treated by her husband. That night, Vani finally realizes that she can no longer live with a man who cannot respect her. In front of Ravi and her friends, she reveals the truth to her parents about the rape and emotional abuse and says that she wants a divorce. They are stunned and try to reason with her but she stands her ground. An argument breaks out and she slaps Ravi, after which he moves to hit her, only to be stopped by Akaash. Ravi realizes that the two are in love and insults Vani's parents. Vani's parents are embarrassed but she defiantly tells them that her happiness is more important than their shame, and leaves the house.\n\nVani returns to Delhi with her friends, where she is able to finally further her studies and get her M.B.A. degree.

Vani's parents are heartbroken and have to endure the shame of their neighbours and community. In the fear of society's response, they decide to get Vani married to the son of an acquaintance. Pressured by her parents and feeling guilt over her sister's actions, Vani reluctantly agrees. She emotionally ends things with Akaash via a phone call and requests him not to try and meet her. Akaash is devastated but slowly becomes bitter and detached with time.\n\nVani's husband Ravi ([[Sunny Nijar]]) is an arrogant, controlling man who rapes with her every night. Ravi is emotionally abusive and expects Vani to cater to his every need, but pretends to be a perfect husband in front of friends and family. He prevents her from going out, working or furthering her studies, and expects her to be a full-time housewife. After an argument, Vani returns home and reveals her unhappiness to her parents. However, they send her back to Ravi after he charms them, and ask him to consider starting a family in order to occupy Vani's time. Time goes by and Vani slowly begins losing self-confidence and becomes resigned to her fate. One day, Vani's aunt and uncle unexpectedly come to visit her and suggest that she go back with them for several days to Delhi, in order to attend her college reunion. Ravi is unhappy but reluctantly agrees, since he will also be away for some time on a business trip.\n\nAt the college, Vani reunites with her friends, who find her to be reserved and depressed. She also comes across Akaash, who is still bitter and hurt about their break up. He angrily confronts her and she runs away, deciding to return home that night. Her friends meet her at the train station and Akaash finally breaks down and cries, something which he has not allowed himself to do previously. Vani decides to stay. The group spend the week together, during which time they have fun and re-live their college memories. Vani tells Akaash the truth about her marriage but says that she cannot divorce Ravi because her parents won't be able to handle it, especially after her sister eloped. Akaash tells his friend that he hopes to reunite with Vani and plans to fill her days with adventures and happiness. He hopes that this will raise her spirits and give her the courage to leave Ravi. The group travel to Chandigarh where Akaash and Vani spend time alone together and rekindle their romance. The trip is cut short by a phone call from Vani's parents, requesting her to visit them. Conflicted, Vani chooses to return home and emotionally leaves her friends and Akaash behind.\n\nAkaash decides that he can't lose Vani once again and the group follows Vani to her home. They stay happily with Vani's parents until Ravi arrives there, too. Akaash observes the way Vani assumes the role of a subservient wife and how she is ill-treated by her husband. That night, Vani finally realizes that she can no longer live with a man who cannot respect her. In front of Ravi and her friends, she reveals the truth to her parents about the rape and emotional abuse and says that she wants a divorce. They are stunned and try to reason with her but she stands her ground. An argument breaks out and she slaps Ravi, after which he moves to hit her, only to be stopped by Akaash. Ravi realizes that the two are in love and insults Vani's parents. Vani's parents are embarrassed but she defiantly tells them that her happiness is more important than their shame, and leaves the house.\n\nVani returns to Delhi with her friends, where she is able to finally further her studies and get her M.B.A. degree. She happily divorces Ravi and later marries Akaash.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Kartik Aaryan]] as Akaash(credited as Kartik Tiwari)\n*[[Nushrat Bharucha]] as Vani\n*[[Kiran Kumar]] as Vani's father\n*[[Sunny Singh (actor)|Sunny Singh]] as Ravi\n*[[Prachi Shah]] as Vani's Mami\n*[[Fatima Sana Shaikh]] as Sumbul, classmate\n*Gautam Mehra as Shekhar, Classmate\n*[[Mahesh Thakur]] as Vani's Mama\n\n==Critical reception==\n''Akaash Vani'' received overall positive reviews from critics.<ref>{{cite news|title=Critics review AkaashVani favourably |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Bollywood/Critics-review-AkaashVani-favourably/Article1-1001613.aspx |accessdate=2 October 2013 |newspaper=Hindustan Times |date=25 January 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010124655/http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Bollywood/Critics-review-AkaashVani-favourably/Article1-1001613.aspx |archivedate=10 October 2013 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref> [[Indo-Asian News Service|IANS]] of [[NDTV]] rated the film 4/5, praising the performances of its lead pair.<ref>{{cite web|title=Movie review:: Akaash Vani|url=http://movies.ndtv.com/movie-reviews/movie-review-akaash-vani-776|publisher=[[NDTV]]|accessdate=2 October 2013}}</ref> Renuka Vyavahare of ''[[The Times of India]]'' gave the film 3 stars, calling it a \"strong [...] and moving social drama\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Vyavahare|first=Renuka |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/movie-reviews/hindi/AkaashVani/movie-review/18164929.cms|title=Akaash Vani|accessdate=2 October 2013|newspaper=[[The Times of India]]|date=25 January 2013}}</ref> Noted critic [[Taran Adarsh]] of [[Bollywood Hungama]] awarded the film 3.5 stars, and praised the acting and characterisation, adding that \"[t]he movie contains just the right blend of sparkle and spice and is definitely worthy of a watch.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Adarsh|first=Taran |title=Aakash Vani (2013) Movie Review|url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/moviemicro/criticreview/id/548934|publisher=[[Bollywood Hungama]]|accessdate=2 October 2013}}</ref> On the other hand, [[Rajeev Masand]] of [[CNN-IBN]] was more critical of the film, giving it 1.5/5, commenting that the film's script is \"inconsistent\".\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe music of the film is composed by Hitesh Sonik with lyrics penned by Luv Ranjan.

When they are caught video-recording illicit activities happening in a secluded house one night by a group of thugs, they attempt to flee from them. While Bharathi's friends are killed, Bharathi manages to escape despite being stabbed by one of the thugs, but after the attack on Bharathi and her friends, the thugs' vehicle explodes due to a small mishap when a matchstick falls over [[petrol]] packets stored in the vehicle, killing all the thugs. Bharathi comes up with a new idea to eradicate society's evils by creating and propagating a fictional character called \"Velayudham\" who wants to clean up the city of terrorism and other illegal activities.\n\nThe scene then shifts to a village called Pavunoor, where a milk vendor named Velayudham alias Velu ([[Vijay (actor)|Vijay]]) is residing with his younger sister Kaveri ([[Saranya Mohan]]), whom he loves dearly. He has a cousin named Vaidehi ([[Hansika Motwani]]) who is deeply in love with him. One day, Velu, Kaveri, and Vaidehi leave for Chennai to collect money from a [[chit fund]] for Kaveri's marriage. At the [[Chennai Egmore railway station]], Velu's money is stolen by Speedu ([[Santhanam (actor)|Santhanam]]), a petty thief. Velu pursues Speedu on a motorbike parked at the station and manages to get back his money, but moments after alighting from the bike, the bike explodes. The parked bike had a bomb which was meant to ensure a terrorist attack at the railway station, and thus, Velu inadvertently thwarted a deadly terrorist attack which would have killed several people. After a few more incidents where Velu unknowingly prevents more terrorist attacks, he comes to Bharathi's attention. She convinces him to take up the role of Velayudham and provide hope to the people. In the avatar of Velayudham, Velu starts to eradicate the evils that pertain within the society such as corruption, prostitution, and terrorism, among others. He soon gains wide support and acceptance among the public and even the police.\n\nA few months later, Velu returns to Pavunoor with Bharathi for Kaveri's marriage. Seeing Bharathi and Velu getting closer, Vaidehi gets more and more jealous. She plans to keep an egg under Bharathi's pillow, but she knows about her plan and reveals that one day, Velayutham reveals that he loves Vaidehi, he told that after Kaveri's marriage that only Vaidehi could be with him and told to her that she should act as she getting closer to him. Vaidehi feels happy and excited, Unknown to Velayudham, Musafir Ibrahim ([[Abhimanyu Singh]]), the leader of a terrorist group, followed him to the village. Ibrahim wants to kill him since he, in the garb of Velayudham, had thwarted every terrorist attack that he had planned in Chennai. On the day of Kaveri's marriage, a bomb planted by Ibrahim at Velu's house explodes, killing Kaveri.\n\nA few days after Kaveri's death, a grieving Velu learns from Bharathi that Ulaganathan ([[Vineet Kumar]]), the corrupt [[Home Minister]] of [[Tamil Nadu]], is indirectly responsible for the terrorist attacks and Kaveri's death. Ulaganathan allowed Ibrahim to carry out terrorist attacks in exchange for money. He even tries to gain popularity by claiming Velayudham as his idea, planning to reveal Ibrahim as Velayudham's real identity in a function at the [[Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Chennai|Nehru Stadium, Chennai]]. Velu returns to Chennai, kills Ibrahim, exposes Ulaganathan's misdeeds, and reveals himself as Velayudham to the whole world.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Vijay (actor)|Vijay]] as Velayudham (Velu)\n* [[Hansika Motwani]] as Vaidehi, Velayutham's love interest\n* [[Genelia D'Souza]] as Bharathi, a journalist\n* [[Saranya Mohan]] as Kaveri, Velu's sister<ref name = \"Title credits\">''Velayudham'' (DVD): clip from 4.36 to 4.48</ref>\n* [[Santhanam (actor)|Santhanam]] as Speed, a petty thief<ref name = \"Title credits\"/>\n* [[Soori (actor)|Soori]] as Abdullah, Velu's friend<ref name = \"Title credits\"/>\n* [[Abhimanyu Singh]] as Musafir Ibrahim, the main antagonist<ref name = \"Title credits\"/>\n* [[Vineet Kumar]] as Ulaganathan, the Home Minister of Tamil Nadu, the other antagonist<ref name = \"Title credits\"/>\n* [[Pandiarajan]] as Head Constable Honest Raj, a supporter of Velayudham<ref name = \"Title credits\"/>\n* [[Sayaji Shinde]] as Asst.

''KOLLY TALK''</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nA young journalist named Bharathi ([[Genelia D'Souza]]), along with two of her friends, investigates a series of [[terrorism|terrorist]] attacks which have taken place in [[Chennai]] and also illegal activities like [[human trafficking]]. When they are caught video-recording illicit activities happening in a secluded house one night by a group of thugs, they attempt to flee from them. While Bharathi's friends are killed, Bharathi manages to escape despite being stabbed by one of the thugs, but after the attack on Bharathi and her friends, the thugs' vehicle explodes due to a small mishap when a matchstick falls over [[petrol]] packets stored in the vehicle, killing all the thugs. Bharathi comes up with a new idea to eradicate society's evils by creating and propagating a fictional character called \"Velayudham\" who wants to clean up the city of terrorism and other illegal activities.\n\nThe scene then shifts to a village called Pavunoor, where a milk vendor named Velayudham alias Velu ([[Vijay (actor)|Vijay]]) is residing with his younger sister Kaveri ([[Saranya Mohan]]), whom he loves dearly. He has a cousin named Vaidehi ([[Hansika Motwani]]) who is deeply in love with him. One day, Velu, Kaveri, and Vaidehi leave for Chennai to collect money from a [[chit fund]] for Kaveri's marriage. At the [[Chennai Egmore railway station]], Velu's money is stolen by Speedu ([[Santhanam (actor)|Santhanam]]), a petty thief. Velu pursues Speedu on a motorbike parked at the station and manages to get back his money, but moments after alighting from the bike, the bike explodes. The parked bike had a bomb which was meant to ensure a terrorist attack at the railway station, and thus, Velu inadvertently thwarted a deadly terrorist attack which would have killed several people. After a few more incidents where Velu unknowingly prevents more terrorist attacks, he comes to Bharathi's attention. She convinces him to take up the role of Velayudham and provide hope to the people. In the avatar of Velayudham, Velu starts to eradicate the evils that pertain within the society such as corruption, prostitution, and terrorism, among others. He soon gains wide support and acceptance among the public and even the police.\n\nA few months later, Velu returns to Pavunoor with Bharathi for Kaveri's marriage. Seeing Bharathi and Velu getting closer, Vaidehi gets more and more jealous. She plans to keep an egg under Bharathi's pillow, but she knows about her plan and reveals that one day, Velayutham reveals that he loves Vaidehi, he told that after Kaveri's marriage that only Vaidehi could be with him and told to her that she should act as she getting closer to him. Vaidehi feels happy and excited, Unknown to Velayudham, Musafir Ibrahim ([[Abhimanyu Singh]]), the leader of a terrorist group, followed him to the village. Ibrahim wants to kill him since he, in the garb of Velayudham, had thwarted every terrorist attack that he had planned in Chennai. On the day of Kaveri's marriage, a bomb planted by Ibrahim at Velu's house explodes, killing Kaveri.\n\nA few days after Kaveri's death, a grieving Velu learns from Bharathi that Ulaganathan ([[Vineet Kumar]]), the corrupt [[Home Minister]] of [[Tamil Nadu]], is indirectly responsible for the terrorist attacks and Kaveri's death. Ulaganathan allowed Ibrahim to carry out terrorist attacks in exchange for money. He even tries to gain popularity by claiming Velayudham as his idea, planning to reveal Ibrahim as Velayudham's real identity in a function at the [[Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Chennai|Nehru Stadium, Chennai]]. Velu returns to Chennai, kills Ibrahim, exposes Ulaganathan's misdeeds, and reveals himself as Velayudham to the whole world.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Vijay (actor)|Vijay]] as Velayudham (Velu)\n* [[Hansika Motwani]] as Vaidehi, Velayutham's love interest\n* [[Genelia D'Souza]] as Bharathi, a journalist\n* [[Saranya Mohan]] as Kaveri, Velu's sister<ref name = \"Title credits\">''Velayudham'' (DVD): clip from 4.36 to 4.48</ref>\n* [[Santhanam (actor)|Santhanam]] as Speed, a petty thief<ref name = \"Title credits\"/>\n* [[Soori (actor)|Soori]] as Abdullah, Velu's friend<ref name = \"Title credits\"/>\n* [[Abhimanyu Singh]] as Musafir Ibrahim, the main antagonist<ref name = \"Title credits\"/>\n* [[Vineet Kumar]] as Ulaganathan, the Home Minister of Tamil Nadu, the other antagonist<ref name = \"Title credits\"/>\n* [[Pandiarajan]] as Head Constable Honest Raj, a supporter of Velayudham<ref name = \"Title credits\"/>\n* [[Sayaji Shinde]] as Asst.

R. K. Kiran]]; [[Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Costume Designer|Best Costume Designer]] for Swetha Srinivas).  The film was remade in Bengali in 2013 as ''[[Kanamachi (film)|Kanamachi]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nAshwin Kumar is a [[Photojournalism|photojournalist]] working for the private newspaper ''Dina Anjal''. He witnesses [[Naxalite]]s robbing a local bank. He chases them and manages to click photos of the robbers. When he tries to escape, he is stopped by a woman Renuka 'Renu' who assumes he is the culprit and helps the robbers to take his camera. However, he is able to secure the [[memory card]] of the camera. The police catch him, and to prove that he is a press photographer, he shows the photos to them, who identify everyone except the gang leader (whose face is covered by a mask). At his office, he again meets Renuka, who has newly joined as Article Editor. He slowly falls in love with Renu. Saraswathi 'Saro' also works in his office and has feelings for Ashwin, who does not reciprocate.\n\nSettled in her new job, Renuka writes a cover story about a politician Aalavandhan, describing his [[Age disparity in sexual relationships|attempt to marry a minor]]. Enraged by this, Aalavandhan barges into the newspaper office and shouts at Renuka. The audio recording of her interview disappears (courtesy Aalavandhan), and she is fired from her job for falsified reporting. Ashwin later risks his life to capture the pictures of Aalavandhan who actually engages in [[Child marriage in India|child marriage]] in a temple at midnight. Later the story with the photos is printed in their newspaper and this makes Renuka reciprocate Ashwin's love. Saro is initially jealous of the love between Ashwin and Renuka, but later accepts it and gets over Ashwin.\n\nMeanwhile, Vasanthan Perumal, a recent graduate and engineer, strives hard to enter the politics by contesting the upcoming election. He is contesting against more experienced politicians who capture the people by giving freebies and money. No-one cares about Vasanthan and his team of graduates, who promise a healthy government to people. Their party name is ''Siragugal'' (wings). Ashwin and Renuka find out about Vasanthan's election campaign, and they and the entire ''Dina Anjal'' team extend their support to the campaign, covering it extensively, much to the chagrin of Aalavandhan and the Chief Minister Yogeswaran 'Yogi'.\n\nOne night, Vasanthan's party organises an election campaign meeting. Ashwin, photographing the event, receives a text message from Saro that states there is a bomb underneath the stage where Vasanthan is speaking. Ashwin manages to save Vasanthan just before the bomb explodes. Later, Ashwin finds Saro fatally wounded near the blast site. Saro struggles to tell something to Ashwin and Renuka before she dies. Ashwin, through a video clip recorded by another photographer, discovers that Saro was intentionally killed by someone. He later notices a resemblance between the leader of the bank robbery and this unknown killer, concluding that the Naxalite leader killed Saro.\n\nA few days later, Renuka notices that Vasanthan's photo in their newspaper was cut from a college class photo, where Ashwin is also present. It is revealed that Vasanthan is Ashwin former college mate. Confronted by Renuka, Ashwin tells her that he and Vasanthan studied in the same college and were best friends. He also tells her that he is happy for Vasanthan's success and is wholeheartedly supporting his election campaign.\n\nIn the election, Vasanthan's party wins by a huge majority and Vasanthan becomes the Chief Minister. He orders the release of 20 Naxals on [[Republic Day (India)|Republic Day]], citing humanity. Shocked on hearing this news, Ashwin rushes to the secretariat to meet Vasanthan. In Vasanthan's office, Ashwin notices that the Naxalite leader who killed Saro is there, talking with Vasanthan. Ashwin airs his grievances to Vasanthan, who ignores him. Ashwin then follows the leader to his hideout. At the same time, Vasanthan orders the Tamil Nadu Police to go kill the Naxals at their hideout and the Police Commandos surround the perimeter of that place. Ashwin, already at the hideout, confronts the Naxalite leader, whose name is Kadhir and finds out from him that Vasanthan had made a deal with the Naxalites to help him win the election. They orchestrated events such as the burning of a hut and saving the woman in that hut (who was also a Naxalite) to win people's sympathy. In the same vein, they had planted a bomb on the stage where Vasanthan was speaking during his meeting. Saro had found out the truth about Vasanthan, but was fatally assaulted by him so that she does not reveal his character and intentions to anybody. Ashwin realises that Saro had tried to warn him and Renuka about Vasanthan's true character before dying and also that now Vasanthan is double-crossing the Naxalites and is planning to kill them as a show of achievement. Ashwin records this confession using his [[Camera phone|mobile phone camera]] and sends it to Renuka, who plans to publish this story in their newspaper. Vasanthan then arrives and kills Kadhir. He also tries to kill Ashwin. However, Ashwin triggers a [[land mine]] there which explodes, killing Vasanthan, while Ashwin manages to escape.\n\nVasanthan's party members arrive at the hideout on hearing the news that Vasanthan had died. Seeing their innocence, Ashwin forces Renuka not to reveal the truth about Vasanthan because his party members would get into serious trouble and lose their seats just for supporting Vasanthan. They did not know about Vasanthan's true character and intentions and supported him, believing his false claims of a \"healthy government\". Instead, Renuka publishes an article saying that Vasanthan had sacrificed his life fighting the Naxalites and died as a [[martyr]]. Ashwin and Renuka submit their resignations to the Editor, S. Krishnakumar 'Krish' for falsified reporting, but he rejects their resignations and tells them to cover the upcoming election.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Jiiva]] as Ashwin Kumar aka Aswin\n* [[Karthika Nair|Karthika]] as Renuka Narayanan aka Renu\n* [[Ajmal Ameer|Ajmal]] as Vasanthan Perumal\n* [[Piaa Bajpai]] as Saraswathi aka Saro\n* [[Prakash Raj]] as [[Chief Minister]] Yogeswaran \"Yogi\"<ref name = \"Title credits\">''Ko'' (DVD): title credits from 1.36 to 1.53</ref>\n* [[Kota Srinivasa Rao]] as Aalavandhan<ref name = \"Title credits\"/>\n* [[Achyuth Kumar]] as S.

The film was remade in Bengali in 2013 as ''[[Kanamachi (film)|Kanamachi]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nAshwin Kumar is a [[Photojournalism|photojournalist]] working for the private newspaper ''Dina Anjal''. He witnesses [[Naxalite]]s robbing a local bank. He chases them and manages to click photos of the robbers. When he tries to escape, he is stopped by a woman Renuka 'Renu' who assumes he is the culprit and helps the robbers to take his camera. However, he is able to secure the [[memory card]] of the camera. The police catch him, and to prove that he is a press photographer, he shows the photos to them, who identify everyone except the gang leader (whose face is covered by a mask). At his office, he again meets Renuka, who has newly joined as Article Editor. He slowly falls in love with Renu. Saraswathi 'Saro' also works in his office and has feelings for Ashwin, who does not reciprocate.\n\nSettled in her new job, Renuka writes a cover story about a politician Aalavandhan, describing his [[Age disparity in sexual relationships|attempt to marry a minor]]. Enraged by this, Aalavandhan barges into the newspaper office and shouts at Renuka. The audio recording of her interview disappears (courtesy Aalavandhan), and she is fired from her job for falsified reporting. Ashwin later risks his life to capture the pictures of Aalavandhan who actually engages in [[Child marriage in India|child marriage]] in a temple at midnight. Later the story with the photos is printed in their newspaper and this makes Renuka reciprocate Ashwin's love. Saro is initially jealous of the love between Ashwin and Renuka, but later accepts it and gets over Ashwin.\n\nMeanwhile, Vasanthan Perumal, a recent graduate and engineer, strives hard to enter the politics by contesting the upcoming election. He is contesting against more experienced politicians who capture the people by giving freebies and money. No-one cares about Vasanthan and his team of graduates, who promise a healthy government to people. Their party name is ''Siragugal'' (wings). Ashwin and Renuka find out about Vasanthan's election campaign, and they and the entire ''Dina Anjal'' team extend their support to the campaign, covering it extensively, much to the chagrin of Aalavandhan and the Chief Minister Yogeswaran 'Yogi'.\n\nOne night, Vasanthan's party organises an election campaign meeting. Ashwin, photographing the event, receives a text message from Saro that states there is a bomb underneath the stage where Vasanthan is speaking. Ashwin manages to save Vasanthan just before the bomb explodes. Later, Ashwin finds Saro fatally wounded near the blast site. Saro struggles to tell something to Ashwin and Renuka before she dies. Ashwin, through a video clip recorded by another photographer, discovers that Saro was intentionally killed by someone. He later notices a resemblance between the leader of the bank robbery and this unknown killer, concluding that the Naxalite leader killed Saro.\n\nA few days later, Renuka notices that Vasanthan's photo in their newspaper was cut from a college class photo, where Ashwin is also present. It is revealed that Vasanthan is Ashwin former college mate. Confronted by Renuka, Ashwin tells her that he and Vasanthan studied in the same college and were best friends. He also tells her that he is happy for Vasanthan's success and is wholeheartedly supporting his election campaign.\n\nIn the election, Vasanthan's party wins by a huge majority and Vasanthan becomes the Chief Minister. He orders the release of 20 Naxals on [[Republic Day (India)|Republic Day]], citing humanity. Shocked on hearing this news, Ashwin rushes to the secretariat to meet Vasanthan. In Vasanthan's office, Ashwin notices that the Naxalite leader who killed Saro is there, talking with Vasanthan. Ashwin airs his grievances to Vasanthan, who ignores him. Ashwin then follows the leader to his hideout. At the same time, Vasanthan orders the Tamil Nadu Police to go kill the Naxals at their hideout and the Police Commandos surround the perimeter of that place. Ashwin, already at the hideout, confronts the Naxalite leader, whose name is Kadhir and finds out from him that Vasanthan had made a deal with the Naxalites to help him win the election. They orchestrated events such as the burning of a hut and saving the woman in that hut (who was also a Naxalite) to win people's sympathy. In the same vein, they had planted a bomb on the stage where Vasanthan was speaking during his meeting. Saro had found out the truth about Vasanthan, but was fatally assaulted by him so that she does not reveal his character and intentions to anybody. Ashwin realises that Saro had tried to warn him and Renuka about Vasanthan's true character before dying and also that now Vasanthan is double-crossing the Naxalites and is planning to kill them as a show of achievement. Ashwin records this confession using his [[Camera phone|mobile phone camera]] and sends it to Renuka, who plans to publish this story in their newspaper. Vasanthan then arrives and kills Kadhir. He also tries to kill Ashwin. However, Ashwin triggers a [[land mine]] there which explodes, killing Vasanthan, while Ashwin manages to escape.\n\nVasanthan's party members arrive at the hideout on hearing the news that Vasanthan had died. Seeing their innocence, Ashwin forces Renuka not to reveal the truth about Vasanthan because his party members would get into serious trouble and lose their seats just for supporting Vasanthan. They did not know about Vasanthan's true character and intentions and supported him, believing his false claims of a \"healthy government\". Instead, Renuka publishes an article saying that Vasanthan had sacrificed his life fighting the Naxalites and died as a [[martyr]]. Ashwin and Renuka submit their resignations to the Editor, S.
