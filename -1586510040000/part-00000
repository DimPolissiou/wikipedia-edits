The car had four seats although the rear seats were small, thus it is usually called a [[2+2 (car body style)|2+2]] rather than a four-seater (the 356 was also a 2+2). A four or five-speed \"Type 901\" [[manual transmission]] was available. The styling was largely penned by Ferdinand \"Butzi\" Porsche, son of [[Ferdinand Anton Ernst Porsche|Ferdinand \"Ferry\" Porsche]]. Butzi Porsche initially came up with a notchback design with proper space for seating two rear passengers but Ferry Porsche insisted that the 356's successor was to use its fastback styling. 7 prototypes were built based on Butzi Porsche's original design and were internally called the Porsche 754 T7.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.msn.com/en-ca/autos/autosclassics/the-porsche-754-t7-prototype-is-the-911s-missing-link/ar-BBUXxos|title=The Porsche 754 T7 Prototype Is The 911's Missing Link|date=2019-03-18|first=Tyler|last=Heatley|publisher=MSN|accessdate=2019-05-24}}</ref> [[Erwin Komenda]], the leader of the Porsche car body construction department who initially objected, was also involved later in the design.\n\n[[File:Bonhams - The Paris Sale 2012 - Porsche 912 'SWB' Coup\u00e9 - 1967 - 014.jpg|thumb|The 911-based 912, powered by a [[flat-4]] engine (1967)]]\n\nProduction of the 356 ended in 1965, but there was still a market for a [[Flat-4|4-cylinder]] car, particularly in the US. The [[Porsche 912|912]], introduced in the same year, served as a direct replacement, offering the de-tuned version of 356 SC's 4-cylinder, {{cvt|1582|cc|L|1|abbr=on}}, {{convert|90|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}} boxer four Type 616/36 engine inside the 911 bodywork with Type 901 four-speed manual transmission (a 5-speed manual transmission was optional).\n\nIn 1966, Porsche introduced the more powerful 911S with Type 901/02 engine having a power output of {{convert|160|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}}. Forged aluminum [[alloy wheel]]s from [[Fuchs Petrolub|Fuchs]], with a 5-spoke design, were offered for the first time. In motorsport at the same time, the engine was developed into the Type 901/20 and was installed in the [[mid-engine design|mid-engine]] [[Porsche 904|904]] and [[Porsche 906|906]] with an increased power output of {{convert|210|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}}, as well as fuel injected Type 901/21 installed in later variants of the 906 and [[Porsche 910|910]] with a power output of {{convert|220|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}}.\n\nIn August 1967, the A series went into production with dual brake circuits and widened (5.5J-15) wheels still fitted with [[Pirelli|Pirelli Cinturato]] 165HR15 CA67 tyres.,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cinturato.net/165-15 |title=165HR15 Pirelli Cinturato Tires |work=cinturato.net |access-date=20 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510165142/https://www.cinturato.net/165-15 |archive-date=10 May 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and the previously standard gasoline-burning heater became optional. The [[Targa top|Targa]] (meaning \"plate\" in Italian<ref>Paternie, Red Book, p. 9</ref>) version was introduced. The Targa had a [[stainless steel]]-clad roll bar, as automakers believed that proposed rollover safety requirements by the US [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) would make it difficult for fully open [[convertible (car)|convertible]]s to meet regulations for sale in the US, an important market for the 911. The name \"Targa\" came from the [[Targa Florio]] sports car road race in [[Sicily]], Italy in which Porsche had several victories until 1973. The last win in the subsequently discontinued event was scored with a 911 Carrera RS against prototypes entered by [[Ferrari]] and [[Alfa Romeo]]. The road going Targa was equipped with a removable roof panel and a removable plastic rear window (although a fixed glass version was offered from 1968).\n\n[[File:Porsche 911 2.0 Coupe IMG 0819.jpg|thumb|[[Porsche 911 classic|Porsche 911 2.0 Coupe]] (1964) at the [[Porsche Museum, Stuttgart|Porsche Museum]] in [[Stuttgart]]]]\n\n[[File:1967 Porsche 911R - Flickr - exfordy.jpg|thumb|The 911 R (1967)]]\n\nThe {{convert|110|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} 911T was also launched in 1967 with Type 901/03 engine. The {{convert|130|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} model was renamed the 911L with Type 901/06 engine and ventilated front disc brakes. The brakes had been introduced on the previous 911S. The 911R with 901/22 engine had a limited production (20 in all), as this was a lightweight racing version with thin fiberglass reinforced plastic doors, a [[magnesium]] crankcase, twin overhead camshafts, and a power output of {{convert|210|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}}.\n\nA [[Semi-automatic transmission|semi-automatic]] ''Sportomatic''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportomatic.org|title=Website for Sportomatic Porsche models|publisher=Sportomatic.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728044851/http://www.sportomatic.org/|archivedate=28 July 2011|url-status=dead|accessdate=2011-10-23}}</ref> model, composed of a [[torque converter]], an [[automatic transmission|automatic clutch]], and the four-speed transmission was added in Autumn 1967.

It remained in production until July 1969. The 911E gained [[Pirelli|185/70VR15 Pirelli Cinturato]] CN36.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cinturato.net/185-70-15.html |title=185/70VR15 Pirelli Cinturato Tires |work=www.cinturato.net |access-date=20 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161227143324/https://www.cinturato.net/185-70-15.html |archive-date=27 December 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and 6J-15 wheels.\n\nThe C series was introduced in August 1969 with an enlarged 2.2-litre engine (84&nbsp;mm bore x 66&nbsp;mm stroke). The wheelbase for all 911 and 912 models was increased from {{convert|2211-2268|mm|in|abbr=on}}, to help as a remedy to the car's nervous handling at the limit. The overall length of the car did not change, but the rear wheels were relocated further back. Fuel injection arrived for the 911S (901/10 engine) and for a new middle model, 911E (901/09 engine).\n\nThe D series was produced from Aug. 1970 to July 1971.\nThe 2.2-litre 911E (C and D series) had lower power output of the 911/01 engine ({{convert|155|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} at 6,200&nbsp;rpm) compared to the 911S's Type 911/02 ({{convert|180|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} at 6,500&nbsp;rpm), but 911E was quicker in acceleration up to {{convert|160|km/h|mph|0}}.\n\nThe E series for 1972\u20131973 model years (August 1971 to July 1972 production) consisted of the same models, but with a new, larger {{cvt|2341|cc|L|1|abbr=on}} engine. This is known as the \"2.4&nbsp;L\" engine, despite its displacement being closer to 2.3 litres.\nThe 911E (Type 911/52 engine) and 911S (Type 911/53) used Bosch mechanical [[fuel injection]] (MFI) in all markets. For 1972 the 911T (Type 911/57) was [[carburettor|carbureted]], except in the US and some Asian markets where the 911T also came with (MFI) mechanical fuel injection (Type 911/51 engine) with power increase over European models (130&nbsp;hp) to 140&nbsp;hp commonly known as a 911T/E.\n\nWith power and torque increase, the 2.4-litre cars also got a newer, stronger transmission, identified by its Porsche type number 915. Derived from the transmission in the [[Porsche 908|908]] race car, the 915 did away with the 901 transmission's \"dog-leg\" style first gear arrangement, opting for a traditional H pattern with first gear up to the left, second gear underneath first, etc. The E series had the unusual oil filler behind the right side door, with the dry sump oil tank relocated from behind the right rear wheel to the front of it in an attempt to move the center of gravity slightly forward for better handling. An extra oil filler/inspection flap was located on the rear wing, for this reason it became known as an \"Oil Klapper\", \"\u00d6lklappe\" or \"Vierte T\u00fcr (4th door)\".\n\nThe F series (August 1972 to July 1973 production) moved the oil tank back to the original behind-the-wheel location. This change was in response to complaints that gas-station attendants often filled gasoline into the oil tank. In January 1973, US 911Ts were switched to the new [[Jetronic|K-Jetronic]] CIS (Continuous Fuel Injection) system from [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] on Type 911/91 engine.\n\n911S models also gained a small [[Spoiler (automotive)|spoiler]] under the front bumper to improve high-speed stability. The cars weighed {{convert|1050|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. The 911 ST was produced in small numbers for racing (the production run for the ST lasted from 1970 to 1971). The cars were available with engines of either {{cvt|3987|cc|L|1|abbr=on}} or {{cvt|3404|cc|L|1|abbr=on}} displacement, having a power output of {{convert|270|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} at 8,000&nbsp;rpm. Weight was down to {{convert|960|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. The cars had success at the Daytona 6 Hours, the [[Sebring 12 Hours]], the [[1000 km N\u00fcrburgring]], and the [[Targa Florio]].\n\n===911 Carrera RS (1973 and 1974)===\n[[File:1973 Porsche 911 RS Carrera (35097626702).jpg|thumb|1973 Porsche 911 Carrera RS]]\n[[File:Paris - RM auctions - 20150204 - Porsche 911 Carrera RS 2.7 Touring - 1973 - 005.jpg|thumb|Porsche 911 Carrera RS 2.7 touring]]\n\nRS stands for ''Rennsport'' in German, meaning ''race sport''. The [[Porsche Carrera|Carrera]] name was reintroduced from the 356 Carrera which had itself been named after Porsche's class victories in the [[Carrera Panamericana]] races in Mexico in the 1950s. The RS was developed to meet [[Homologation (motorsport)|motorsport homologation]] requirements. Compared to a standard 911S, the Carrera 2.7 RS had a larger engine (2,687&nbsp;cc) developing {{convert|210|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} with Bosch ([[Kugelfischer]]) mechanical fuel injection, revised and stiffened suspension, a \"ducktail\" rear spoiler, larger brakes, wider rear wheels and rear fenders, to fit 185/70VR15 & 215/60VR15 Pirelli Cinturato CN36 tyres. In RS Touring form it weighed {{convert|1075|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, in Sport Lightweight form it was about {{convert|100|kg|lb|abbr=on}} lighter, the saving coming from thin gauge steel used for parts of the body shell and also the use of thinner glass. In total, 1,580 units were made, and qualified for the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] [[Group 4 (racing)|Group 4]] class. 49 Carrera RS cars were built with {{cvt|2808|cc|L|1|abbr=on}} engines rated at {{convert|300|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}}.\n\n[[File:Porsche 911 RSR LM24.jpg|thumb|The 911 RSR]]\n\nFor the 1974 IROC Championship (which started in December 1973), 1973 Carrera RSR models were fitted with the 3.0 engine and a flat \"whale tail\" in place of the ducktail spoiler along with wide body panels and large tyres.\n\nIn 1974, Porsche developed the Carrera RS 3.0 with mechanical fuel injection rated at {{convert|230|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}}. Its price was almost twice that of the 2.7 RS, but it offered racing capability. The chassis was largely similar to that of the 1973 Carrera RSR and the braking system was from the [[Porsche 917|917]] racing car. The use of thinner metal plate panels and a minimalist interior enabled its weight to be reduced to around {{convert|900|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe Carrera RSR 3.0 was sold to racing teams and scored wins in several major sports car races of the mid-1970s. Also, a prototype Carrera RSR Turbo (with 2.1-litre engine due to a 1.4x equivalency formula) came second at the [[1974 24 Hours of Le Mans|24 Hours of Le Mans in 1974]] and won several major races, a significant event in that its engine would form the basis of many future Porsche attempts in sports car racing. This, and the earlier 917, was Porsche's commitment to [[turbocharger]] applications in its cars\n\n===911 and 911S 2.7 (1973\u20131977)===\n\nModel year 1974 (G Series August 1973 to July 1974 production) saw three significant changes. First, the engine size was increased to 2,687&nbsp;cc achieving higher torque. Second, new impact [[Bumper (automobile)|bumpers]] conformed with low-speed protection requirements of US regulations. Thirdly, the use of K-Jetronic CIS Bosch fuel injection in two of the three models in the line up&mdash; the 911 and 911S models, retaining the narrow rear arches of the old 2.4, now had a 2.7-litre engine rated at {{convert|150|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|175|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}}, respectively. The standard 911 version, received an increase to {{convert|165|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} for Model Year 1976, which meant that starting from MY 1976, there was only a difference in power of 10&nbsp;hp between the 911 and the 911S. The engine remained a K-Jetronic 2.7-litre. The 911S 2.7 engine was rated during the entire lifespan at {{convert|175|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}}.\n\n===Carrera 2.7 MFI and CIS (1974\u20131976)===\nThe Carrera 2.7 model built for all markets, except for the United States, used the {{convert|210|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} RS 911/83 engine with Bosch mechanical fuel injection pump from the 1973 Carrera RS. These Carrera 2.7 MFI models were built from 1974 until 1976 and were mechanically identical to the 1973 Carrera RS. The Carrera 2.7 model produced for the North American markets, often referred to as the Carrera 2.7 CIS, was powered by the same 2.7-litre engine as the 911S which produced {{convert|175|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}}. The initial Carrera 2.7 models had the same welded-on rear RS flares, before switching to the SC stamped style rear flares during the middle of the 1974 production year. The Carrera 2.7 coup\u00e9s weighed in at {{convert|1075|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, the same weight as the 1973 Carrera RS Touring.\n\nFor the 1974 model year, the Carrera 2.7 was available with the \"ducktail\" rear spoiler first introduced with the 1973 Carrera RS. In the North American markets the ducktail was standard equipment for the Carrera. All other markets the ducktail was optional, except for the home German market where the ducktail had been outlawed by the T\u00dcV road homologation department. This led to the introduction of the whale tail rear spoiler, available as an option on the 1974-75 Carrera 2.7 models, as well as the newly introduced 930 Turbo.\n\nThe Carrera 2.7 was replaced by the Carrera 3.0 for the 1976 model year, except for a special run of 113 1976 Carrera 2.7 MFI coup\u00e9s were built for the German market featuring the 911/83 RS engine, with an additional 20 narrow-bodied 1976 Carrera MFI 2.7 Targas being supplied to the Belgian Gendarmerie. The 1976 Carrera 2.7 MFI Sondermodells were the last mechanically fuel injected 911 produced by Porsche, and still featured the 1973 RS engine.\n\n===912E (1976)===\n\nFor the 1976 model year, the 912E was produced for the U.S. market. This was 4-cylinder version of the 911 in the same manner as the 912 that had last been produced in 1969. It used the I-series chassis powered by the [[Volkswagen]] 2.0 engine also used in the [[Porsche 914]] for 1973 through 1975 model years. 2,099 units were produced. The 912E was replaced by the front-engine [[Porsche 924]] for the 1977 model year.\n\n===Carrera 3.0 (1976\u20131977)===\n\n[[File:Porsche 911 Carrera 3.0.JPG|thumbnail|left|Porsche 911 Carrera 3.0]]\n[[File:Porsche 911 Carrera 3.0 1976.JPG|thumbnail|right|Porsche 911 Carrera 3.0]]\n\nFor the 1976 model year, Porsche introduced the Carrera 3.0 with wide rear flares, optional whaletail, and a variety of other luxury options. It was available in all markets except North America. The Carrera 3.0 was fitted with a variation of the 930 Turbo's 2994&nbsp;cc engine (minus the [[turbocharger]]). The engine (dubbed the 930/02) featured K-Jetronic CIS. It developed {{convert|200|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} in contrast to the older Carrera 2.7 MFI model's {{convert|210|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}}. The crankcase and gearbox housing were made of aluminium rather than magnesium for improved reliability. Magnesium cases were renown for thermal expansion/contraction issues as engines grew in displacement and heat generation also increased.\n\nThe new engine, which featured bigger intake and exhaust valves, produced greater torque allowing the Carrera 3.0 to achieve the same performance as the previous Carrera 2.7, {{convert|0|\u2013|100|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} in 6.1 seconds and {{convert|0|\u2013|200|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} in 27 seconds. Both versions boasted a top speed of approximately {{convert|236|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.\n\nWeight increased marginally by {{convert|45|kg|lb|abbr=on}} to {{convert|1120|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe 911 Carrera 3.0 was produced in both targa (1,125 examples produced) and coup\u00e9 (2,566) versions. The Carrera 3.0 was available with manual gearbox (type 915) with 4 or 5 speeds as well as 3-speed automatic transmission (called the Sportomatic). Production totals were 3,691 manual cars and 58 Sportomatic cars.\n\n===930 Turbo and Turbo Carrera 3.0-litre (1975\u20131977)===\n{{Main|Porsche 930}}\n[[File:Nationale oldtimerdag Zandvoort 2010, Red Porsche.JPG|thumb|Porsche 911 Turbo (930)]]\nFor the 1975 model year, Porsche introduced the first production [[turbocharged]] 911. Although called the 930 Turbo (930 being its internal type number) in Europe, it was marketed as the 930 Turbo Carrera in North America. The body shape incorporated wide wheel-arches to accommodate the wide 205/50R15 & 225/50R15 Pirelli P7 tyres, and a large rear spoiler often known as a \"[[Whale tail (automotive spoiler)|whale tail]]\" on the early cars (modified from the original 1974 IROC design). They were initially fitted with a 3.0-litre engine {{convert|260|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} and four-speed manual transmission.\n\n[[File:Porsche 934 Turbo (9224976479).jpg|thumb|The Porsche 934, one of the first racing versions of the 930 Turbo]]\n[[File:1979 Porsche 935 (20202549045).jpg|thumb|The Porsche 935 known for its signature \"slant nose\" front]]\n\nProduction of the first 400 units qualified the 930 for FIA Group 4 competition. With the racing version called the [[Porsche 934]] of 1976 participating at the [[Le Mans 24 Hours|24 Hours of Le Mans]] and other races including battles with the [[BMW E9|BMW 3.0 CSL \"Batmobile\"]]. The [[Group 5 (racing)|FIA Group 5]] version called [[Porsche 935]] evolved from the 934. Fitted with a slope nose or \"slant nose\", the 500+ PS car was campaigned in 1976 by the factory, winning the world championship title. Private teams went on to win many races, like Le Mans in 1979, and continued to compete successfully with the car well into the 1980s until the FIA and IMSA rules were changed.\n\n===930 Turbo 3.3-litre (1978\u20131989)===\n{{Main|Porsche 930}}\n[[File:12-01-03-autostadtl-by-RalfR-81.jpg|thumb|Porsche 930 3.3-litre, distinguished by its raised \"whale-tail\" rear wing]]\n\nFor the 1978 model year, Porsche revised the 930 with a larger 3.3-litre [[turbocharged]] engine with intercooler rated at {{convert|300|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}}. To fit the intercooler a newly designed \"tea-tray\" tail spoiler replaced the earlier whale tail spoiler. Porsche dropped the \"Carrera\" nomenclature for the North American markets and the car was simply called the Porsche 911 Turbo worldwide. The larger engine helped reduce some of the turbo lag inherent in the earlier models.\n\nIn 1989, a 5-speed manual transmission became available for the 930. The 930 was replaced in 1990 with the [[Porsche 964|964]] turbo featuring the same 3.3-litre engine. There have been turbocharged variants of each subsequent generation of 911 since then.\n\n===911SC (1978\u20131983)===\n\n[[File:1983Porsche911SC.JPG|thumb|1983 Porsche 911 Super Carrera, the last production year of the Super Carrera]]\n[[File:1000pistestoivonen84.jpg|thumb|[[Henri Toivonen]] at ''rallye des 1000 pistes'' in 1984 on a Porsche 911 SC RS]]\n\nIn 1978, Porsche introduced the new version of the 911, called the '911SC'. Porsche reintroduced the SC designation for the first time since the 356SC (as distinguished from the race engined 356 Carrera). There was no Carrera version of the 911SC. The \"SC\" stands for \"Super Carrera\". It featured a 3.0-litre aluminum engine with Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection and a 5-speed 915 transmission. Originally power output was {{convert|180|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}}, later {{convert|191|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} and then in 1981 it was increased to {{convert|204|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}}. The move to an aluminum engine was to regain case reliability, something missing for many years with magnesium. In 1981 a Cabriolet concept car was introduced at the [[Frankfurt Motor Show]]. The [[convertible]] body design also featured [[four-wheel drive]], although this was dropped in the production version. The first 911 Cabriolet debuted in late 1982, as a 1983 model. This was Porsche's first cabriolet since the [[Porsche 356|356]] of the mid-1960s. A total of 4,214 were sold in its introductory year, despite its premium price relative to the open-top targa.<ref name=Seventy>P. 77 Paternie, P (2000).

Sales of the 911 remained so strong however, that Porsche revised its strategy and decided to inject new life into the 911 editions. 911 SC sales totaled 58,914 cars.<ref name=Seventy/>\n\n[[Peter W. Schutz]] (CEO Porsche AG 1981\u20131987) wrote: {{quotation|\nThe decision to keep the 911 in the product line occurred one afternoon in the office of Dr. Helmuth Bott [[:de:Helmuth Bott]], the Porsche operating board member responsible for all engineering and development.

Two of them stretched far into the future, but the 911 program stopped at the end of 1981. I remember rising from my chair, walking over to the chart, taking a black marker pen, and extending the 911 program bar clean off the chart. I am sure I heard a silent cheer from Professor Bott, and I knew I had done the right thing.

This was the last iteration in the original 911 series, with all subsequent models featuring new body styling and new brake, electronic, and suspension technologies.\n\nA new higher-displacement engine, a 3.2-litre horizontally opposed flat 6-cylinder unit, was utilized. At the time Porsche claimed it was 80% new.<ref>Corlett, p. 13</ref> The new swept volume of 3,164 cc was achieved using the {{convert|95|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} bore (from the previous SC model) combined with the 1978 Turbo 3.3 crankshaft's {{convert|74.4|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} stroke. In addition, higher domed pistons increased the compression ratio from 9.8 to 10.3:1 (9.5:1 for the US market). New inlet manifold and exhaust systems were fitted. The 915 transmission was carried over from the SC series for the first three model years. In 1987, the Carrera got a new five-speed gearbox sourced from [[Getrag]], model number G50 with proven [[BorgWarner]] synchronizers. This slightly heavier version also featured a hydraulically operated clutch.\n\nWith the new engine, power was increased to {{convert|207|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}} (at 5,900&nbsp;rpm) for North American-delivered cars and to {{convert|237|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} (at 5,900&nbsp;rpm) for most other markets. This version of the 911 accelerated {{convert|0|\u2013|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}} in 5.4 seconds and had a top speed of {{convert|150|mph|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}} as measured by ''[[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]]''. Factory figures were more modest: 0\u201360&nbsp;mph time of 6.3 seconds for the US version and 6.1 seconds for cars outside the American market.\n\nThe brake discs were increased in size to aid in more effective heat dissipation and improved oil-fed chain tensioners were fitted to the engine. To improve oil cooling, a finned cooler replaced the serpentine lines in the front passenger fender well. This was further improved in 1987, with the addition of a thermostatically controlled fan.\n\nDriving refinement and motor reliability were improved with an upgrade of the fuel and [[Ignition system|ignition]] control components to an [[Jetronic|L-Jetronic]] with Bosch Motronics 2 DME (Digital Motor Electronics system). An improvement in fuel-efficiency was due to the DME providing a petrol cut-off on the overrun. Changes in the fuel map and chip programming from October 1986 further improved the power to {{convert|217|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}} (at 5,900&nbsp;rpm) for North American delivered cars as well as for other markets mandating low emissions, like Germany.\n\nThree basic models were available \u2013 coup\u00e9, targa and cabriolet. The Carrera is almost indistinguishable from the SC with the external clue being the front fog lights that were integrated into the front valance. Only cosmetic changes were made during the production of the Carrera, with a redesigned dashboard featuring larger air conditioning vents appearing in 1986.\n\nIn 1984, Porsche also introduced the M491 option. Officially called the Supersport in the UK, it was commonly known as the \"Turbo-look\".{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} It was a style that resembled the 930 Turbo with wide wheel arches and the distinctive \"tea tray\" tail. It featured the stiffer suspension shared with the turbo and the superior turbo braking system as well as the wider turbo wheels. Sales of the Supersport were high for its first two years in the United States because the desirable 930 was not available.\n\n[[File:Porsche Carrera CS registered August 1988 3164cc.jpg|thumb|right|1988 Porsche Carrera CS]]\n\nIn 1985, Porsche introduced the first Carrera Club Sport prototype with the identification number WP0ZZZ91ZF100848. Later on in that year, a 911 Club Sport Row (Rest Of World) with the identification number WP0ZZZ91ZFS101166 was special ordered for a Porsche driver that was particularly inspired by the CS prototype on the track. From 1987 to September 1989, Porsche decided to produced 340 units for their customers that wanted a track inspired road car, The 911 Carrera Club Sport (CS) (option M637), is a reduced weight version of the standard Carrera purposely built for club racing, it gained engine and suspension modifications. The CS had a blueprinted engine with hollow intake valves and a higher rev limit, deletion of: all power options, sunroof (except one unit), air conditioning (except two units), radio, rear seat, undercoating, sound insulation, rear wiper, door pocket lids, fog lamps, front hood locking mechanism, engine and luggage compartment lights, lockable wheel nuts and even the rear lid \"Carrera\" logo, all in order to save an estimated {{convert|70|kg|lb|abbr=on}} in weight. With the exception of CS cars delivered to the UK, all are identifiable by the \"CS Club Sport\" decal on the left front fender and came in a variety of colors, some special ordered. Some U.S. CS cars did not have the decal installed by the dealer; however, all have a \"SP\" stamp on the crankcase and cylinder head. The UK cars were all finished \"Grand Prix White\" with a red \"Carrera CS\" decal on each side of the car and red wheels. Although the CS was well received by the club racers, because it cost more than the standard 911, but had fewer comfort features. According to Porsche Club of America and Porsche Club Great Britain CS Registers, 21 are documented as delivered to the U.S. in 1988 with 7 in 1989, one to Canada in 1988 and 53 to the United Kingdom from 1987 to 1989.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nIn 1988, Porsche produced 875 examples of the CE or Commemorative Edition 911 Carrera in coupe, targa and cabriolet variants to mark the production of the 250,000th 911. Distinguishing features include special diamond blue metallic paint with color-matched Fuchs wheels, front and rear spoilers, and interior carpets and leather. These cars also featured Dr. Ferdinand Porsche's signature embroidered on the seats in the headrest area. Of the 875 examples produced, only 300 were imported to the US (120 coupes, 100 cabrios and 80 Targas),  250 were sold in Germany, 50 went to the UK, and the remainder to other countries.\n\nFor 1989, Porsche produced the 25th Anniversary Special Edition model to mark the 25th year of 911 production. The 1989 Porsche brochure lists production of 500 U.S. market cars, of which 300 were coup\u00e9s (240 in silver metallic paint and 60 in satin black metallic, and 200 cabriolet models (160 in silver and 40 in black). All had \"silk grey\" leather with black accent piping and silk grey velour carpeting. Included were body color Fuchs wheels in 6x16 (front) and 8x16 (rear), stitched leather console with an outside temperature gauge and a CD or cassette holder, a limited slip differential, and a short shifting gear lever, as well as small bronze \"25th Anniversary Special Edition\" badges\n\n[[File:Porsche-32-speedster.jpg|thumb|Porsche 911 Carrera 3.2 Speedster]]\n\nThe 911 Speedster (option M503), a low-roof version of the Cabriolet which was evocative of the 356 Speedster of the 1950s, was produced in limited numbers (2,104 units) starting in January 1989 until July 1989 as both a narrow body car and a Turbo-look. The narrow version production was 171 units. The Speedster started as a design under Helmuth Bott<!-- [http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmuth_Bott] --> in 1983 but was not manufactured until six years later. It was a two-seat convertible that featured a low swept windshield.<ref>Corlett, p. 45</ref>\n\nTotal production of the 911 3.2 Carrera series was 76,473 cars (35,670 coup\u00e9, 19,987 cabrio, 18,468 targa).<ref>Corlett, p. 74</ref>\n\nAccording to the manufacturer, around 150,000 of the 911 cars from the model years 1964 to 1989 are still on the road today.<ref>{{cite press release |url= http://newsroom.porsche.com/en/products/a-fountain-of-youth-for-classic-cars-10719.html |title= A fountain of youth |publisher= newsroom.porsche |date= 27 June 2014 |accessdate= 27 June 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150626152858/http://newsroom.porsche.com/en/products/a-fountain-of-youth-for-classic-cars-10719.html |archive-date= 26 June 2015 |url-status= live |df= dmy-all }}</ref>\n{{-}}\n\n===964 Series (1989\u20131993)===\n{{Main|Porsche 964}}\n[[File:1990 Porsche 911 Carrera 2 (803367948).jpg|thumb|1990 Porsche 911 ''Carrera 2'']]\n\nIn late 1989, the 911 underwent a major evolution with the introduction of the Type 964. With technologies from the [[Porsche 959|959]] flagship model, this would be an important car for Porsche, since the world economy was undergoing [[recession]] and the company could not rely on its image alone. It was launched as the Carrera 4, the \"4\" indicating [[four-wheel-drive]], demonstrating the company's commitment to engineering. [[Drag coefficient]] was down to 0.32. A rear spoiler deployed at high speed, preserving the purity of design when the vehicle was at rest. The chassis was redesigned overall. Coil springs, [[ABS brakes]] and [[power steering]] made their debut. The engine was increased in size to 3,600&nbsp;cc and was rated at 250&nbsp;PS (184&nbsp;kW). The [[rear-wheel-drive]] version, the Carrera 2, arrived a year later.\n\nThe [[Porsche 911#964 Turbo (1990\u20131994)|964 incarnation of the 911 Turbo]] returned in 1990 after an absence from the price lists. At first it used a refined version of the 3.3&nbsp;L engine of the previous Turbo, but two years later a turbocharged engine based on the 3.6&nbsp;L engine of the other 964 models was introduced.\n\nIn 1990, Porsche introduced the ahead-of-its-time [[Tiptronic]] automatic transmission in the 964 Carrera 2, featuring adaptive electronic management and full manual control. The 964 was one of the first cars in the world offered with dual [[airbags]] standard (from 1991), the first being the [[Porsche 944 Turbo|944 Turbo]] (from 1987).\n\n[[File:Porsche Carrera RS - Flickr - Alexandre Pr\u00e9vot.jpg|thumb|Porsche 964 Carrera RS]]\n\nIn 1992, Porsche re-introduced a limited-edition RS model, inspired by the 1973 Carrera RS and emissions-legal in Europe only. In 1993, appeals from American customers resulted in Porsche developing the RS America of which 701 units were built. In 1994, the RS America returned with rear seats. A total of 84 RS America cars were made in 1994. However, while European RS was a homologation special, RS America was an option delete variant of the regular model. The RS 3.8 of 1993 had Turbo-style bodywork, a larger fixed whale tail in place of the electrictronically operated rear spoiler, and a 300&nbsp;PS (221&nbsp;kW) {{cvt|3746|cc|L|1|abbr=on}} engine.\n\nSince the RS/RS America was intended as a no-compromise, higher performance version of the 964, there were four factory options available: a [[limited-slip differential]], AM/FM [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] stereo, air conditioning, and a sunroof. The interior was more basic than a standard 911 as well; for example the interior door panels lacked the armrests and door pockets and had a simple pull strap for the opening mechanism.\n\n====964 Turbo (1990\u20131994)====\n[[File:Porsche 911-964 turbo 1990-1993 frontright 2009-10-04 U.jpg|thumb|left|Porsche 964 Turbo]]\n\nIn 1990 Porsche introduced a [[1991-1992 Porsche 964 Turbo Technical Data|Turbocharged version]] of the 964 series. This car is sometimes mistakenly called 965 (this type number actually referred to a [[Porsche 969|stillborn project]] that would have been a hi-tech turbocharged car in the vein of the 959). For the 1991 through 1993 model years, Porsche produced the 964 Turbo with the 930's proven 3.3&nbsp;L engine, improved to have a power output of 320&nbsp;PS (235&nbsp;kW). 1994 brought the Carrera 2/4's 3.6&nbsp;L engine, now in turbocharged form and sending a staggering {{convert|360|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} to the rear wheels. With the 993 on the way, this car was produced through 1994 and remains rather rare.\n\n===993 Series (1994\u2013mid 1998)===\n{{Main|Porsche 993}}\n[[File:1996 Porsche 911 993 GT2 - Flickr - The Car Spy (4).jpg|thumb|right|The mid-nineties Type 993 had sleeker bodywork. This is the high-performance GT2 variant]]\n\nThe 911 was again revised for model year 1994 under the internal name Type 993. This car was significant as it was the final incarnation of the [[air-cooled]] 911 first introduced in 1964.  Most enthusiasts and collectors consider the 993 to be the best of the air-cooled 911 series.  As Car & Driver noted, \"Porsche's version of the Goldilocks tale is the 993-generation 911, the one many Porschephiles agree that the company got just right,\" with an \"ideal blend of technology and classic 911 air-cooled heritage.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=1995\u201398 Porsche 911 Carrera Buyer's Guide [Econo-Exotics] |url=http://blog.caranddriver.com/1995-98-porsche-911-carrera-buyers-guide-econo-exotics/ |date=2 May 2013 |first=James |last=Tate |work=Car and Driver |accessdate=24 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319183643/http://blog.caranddriver.com/1995-98-porsche-911-carrera-buyers-guide-econo-exotics/ |archive-date=19 March 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>  Porsche itself refers to the 993 as \"a significant advance, not just from a technical, but also a visual perspective.\"<ref>http://www.porsche.com/usa/accessoriesand services/classic/models/993/993/</ref> \"993s especially [are] widely regarded as the best the 911 ever got.\"<ref>James Edition, 28 April 2015, \"The Classic Porsche 911 Market Continues to Surprise.\"</ref>\n\nThe exterior featured all-new front and rear ends. The revised bodywork was smoother, having a noticeably more aerodynamic front end somewhat reminiscent of the [[Porsche 959|959]]. Styling was by Englishman Tony Hatter under the supervision of design chief [[Harm Lagaay]] and was completed in 1991.\n\nAlong with the revised bodywork, mechanically the 993 also featured an all-new multilink rear suspension that improved the car's ride and handling. This rear suspension was largely derived from the stillborn [[Porsche 989]]'s rear multilink design, and served to rectify the problems with earlier models' tendency to oversteer if the throttle or brakes were applied mid-corner. These modifications also reduced previous 911's lift-off oversteer problems to a much more moderate degree.\n\n[[File:Porsche 993 RS Clubsport (3).jpg|thumb|The Porsche 993 Carrera RS continued the tradition of a light weight and minimalist 911 beginning with the 1973 Carrera RS]]\n\nThe new suspension, along with chassis refinements, enabled the car to keep up dynamically with the competition. Engine capacity remained at 3.6&nbsp;L, but power rose to 272&nbsp;PS (200&nbsp;kW / 268&nbsp;hp) due to better engine management and exhaust design, and beginning with model year 1996 to 286&nbsp;PS (210&nbsp;kW / 281&nbsp;hp). The 993 was the first Porsche to debut variable-length intake runners with the \"Varioram\" system on 1996 models. This addressed the inherent compromise between high-rpm power production and low-rpm torque production, and was one of the first of its kind to be employed on production vehicles. However, the Varioram version with its OBD II had issues with carbon deposits, resulting in failed smog tests. This caused expensive repairs, and made comparisons with the 1995 car (with OBD I and just 12&nbsp;hp less) inevitable. Meanwhile, a new four-wheel-drive system was introduced as an option in the form of the Carrera 4, the [[rear-wheel drive|rear-wheel-drive]] versions simply being called Carrera or C2. A lightweight RS variant had a 3.8&nbsp;L engine rated at 300&nbsp;PS (221&nbsp;kW / 296&nbsp;hp), and was only rear-wheel drive.\n\n[[File:Porsche, Techno-Classica 2018, Essen (IMG 9738).jpg|thumb|right|The Porsche 993 Targa had a departure from the classic Targa design, incorporating an expensive glass sliding roof mechanism]]\n\nThe Targa open-topped model also made a return, this time with a large glass roof that slid under the rear window. The expensive air-cooled 993 Targa had a limited production run between 1996 and 1998.

The similarity in specification and in performance levels inspired several comparison road tests with the 959.<ref>(f.e. [[Car and Driver]], July 1997, p. 63)</ref> The 3.6&nbsp;L twin-turbocharged M64/60 engine is rated at 408&nbsp;PS (300&nbsp;kW / 402&nbsp;hp). The performance was outstanding at the time, as 0 to 97&nbsp;km/h (60&nbsp;mph) has been measured at 3.2 seconds, and the braking was even more impressive in 2.3 seconds from the same speed. The car's top speed was measured at {{cvt|200|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} at 7,000 rpm. The differences were striking - the 959 had a much smaller engine, sequential turbocharging and a computer controlled all wheel drive system. The 993 turbo had parallel turbochargers, 3.6 litres of displacement, and a viscous coupling for the center differential in the AWD drivetrain. The turbo was only produced in 1996 and 1997 model years. The main difference was that the ECU in the 1996 model year could not be flashed for an upgrade, while the 1997 could. Additionally, the 1996 year had Porsche crested centre caps on the wheels, while the 1997 had turbo inscribed. Another difference is the motion sensor and map lights above the interior rear view mirror on the 1997 while the 1996 had no such devices.\n\nIn 1997, Porsche introduced a limited run of 183 units of the Sport version of the 993 turbo dubbed the turbo S. With 24&nbsp;PS (17.7&nbsp;kW) over the regular Turbo's 408&nbsp;PS (300&nbsp;kW), features include a scoop on the side right behind the doors for engine cooling and vents on the whale tail rear spoiler. Aside from an upgraded ECU mapping, a centre oil cooler behind the centre air intake at the front bumper was added.\n\n==Water-cooled engines (1998\u2013present)==\n\n===996 (1998/9\u20132004)===\n{{Main|Porsche 996}}\n\n[[File:2002 911C4S.JPG|thumb|right|2002 [[Porsche 996|996]] Carrera 4S]]\nThe Type 996 introduced in 1998 represented two major changes for the venerable 911 lineage: a [[water-cooled]] flat-6 engine replaced the popular air-cooled engine used in the 911 for 34&nbsp;years, and the body shell received its first major re-design. Changing to a water-cooled engine was controversial with Porsche traditionalists, who noted this as the end of the 'true' 911.\n\nThe 996 styling shared its front end with Porsche's mid engine entry-level [[Porsche Boxster|Boxster]]. Pinky Lai's work on the exterior won international design awards between 1997 and 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.designnstyling.com/|title=::Design & Styling|work=designnstyling.com|accessdate=24 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150129123936/http://www.designnstyling.com/|archive-date=29 January 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe Carrera variant had a 0.30 [[coefficient of drag]]. The interior was criticized for its plainness and its lack of relationship to prior 911 interiors, although this came largely from owners of older 911s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autosport911.com/porsche911.html|title=AutoSport911|publisher=autosport911.com|accessdate=26 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127201500/http://www.autosport911.com/porsche911.html|archive-date=27 November 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe Type 996 spawned over a dozen variations, including an all-wheel-drive Carrera 4 and Carrera 4S (the latter which had a 'Turbo look' in facelift form) models, the club racing-oriented [[Porsche 911 GT3|GT3]] and GT3 RS instead of a Carrera RS variant and the [[turbocharging|forced-induction]] 996 Turbo and [[Porsche 911 GT2|GT2]]. The Turbo, which was four-wheel-drive and had a  [[twin-turbocharged]] engine, often made appearances in magazines' lists of the best cars on sale.\n\nThe Carrera and Carrera 4 underwent revisions for 2002 model year, receiving clear lens front and rear indicator lights which were first seen on the Turbo version two years earlier. This allowed the 911 to be more distinguishable from the Boxster. A mildly revised front fascia was also introduced, though the basic architecture remained.\n\nEngine displacement was 3.4&nbsp;L and power \noutput was {{convert|300|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} featuring a change to an \"integrated dry sump\" design and variable valve timing. The displacement was increased in 2002 to 3.6&nbsp;L and power received an increase to 320&nbsp;PS (235&nbsp;kW).\n\nThe folding roof mechanism on the convertible variants required 19 seconds for operation. An electronically adjustable rear spoiler was installed that raised at speeds over 120&nbsp;km/h (75&nbsp;mph). It could also be raised manually by means of an electric switch.\n\nStarting from the models with water-cooled engines, all variants of the 911 Carrera do not come with rear [[limited-slip differential]], except the 40th Anniversary 911, GT2, GT3 and Turbo. The exception would be for MY1999 where the limited-slip differential was available as option code 220.{{citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=June 2012}}\n\n====996 GT3 (1999\u20132004)====\n[[File:Porsche 996 GT3 - Flickr - Alexandre Pr\u00e9vot (3).jpg|thumb|left|996 GT3]]\n[[File:Porsche exhibition at Oca, Parque do Ibirapuera 2018 057.jpg|thumb|right|996 GT3 RS]]\n\nPorsche introduced a road legal GT3 version of the 996 series which was derived from the company's racing car used in the GT3 class racing. Simply called GT3, the car featured lightweight materials including thinner windows and deletion of the rear seats. The GT3 was a lighter and more focused design with the emphasis on handling and performance, a concept that dates back to the 1973 Carrera RS. The suspension ride height was lowered and tuned for responsiveness over compliance and comfort. These revisions improved handling and steering. Of more significance was the engine used in the GT3. Instead of using a version of the water-cooled units found in other 996 models, the naturally aspirated engine was derived from the [[Porsche 911 GT1#1998|911 GT1 '98]] sports-prototype racing car and featured lightweight materials which enabled the engine to have higher rpm.\n\nThe engine used was a naturally aspirated {{cvt|3600|cc|L|1|abbr=on}} flat-six rather than the engine from the pre-facelift and revised Carrera. It is rated at {{convert|365|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at first and later improved to {{convert|386|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at the end of the 996 series' revision.\n\n====996 Turbo (2001\u20132005)====\n[[File:Porsche 996 Turbo - Flickr - Alexandre Pr\u00e9vot (15).jpg|thumb|996 Turbo]]\n\n[[File:Techno Classica 2018, Essen (IMG 0015).jpg|thumb|right|996 Turbo S]]\n\nIn 2000, Porsche launched the turbocharged version of the Type 996 for the 2001 model year. Like the GT3, the Turbo's engine was derived from the engine used in the 911 GT1 and, like its predecessor, featured twin-turbos and now had a power output of {{cvt|420|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Two/> Also like its predecessor, the new Turbo was only available with all-wheel drive. In 2002, the X50 package was available that increased the engine output to {{cvt|450|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} with {{cvt|620|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque across a wide section of the power band. With the X50 package, the car could accelerate from 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h (0\u201362&nbsp;mph) in 3.91&nbsp;seconds. Later on toward the end of the 996 life cycle, the Turbo S nameplate also returned with the debut of the cabriolet variant as well. The Turbo S boasted even more power&mdash; 450&nbsp;PS (331&nbsp;kW) and 620&nbsp;N\u00b7m (457&nbsp;lb\u00b7ft<sub>f</sub>)&mdash; than the standard Turbo courtesy of the X50 package being standard. The Turbo S was limited to 1,500 units worldwide. The Turbo can attain a top speed of {{convert|189|mph|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}}.<ref name=Two>Paternie, p. 92</ref>\n\nThe styling was more individual than the previous generations of the Turbo. Along with the traditional wider rear wing, the 996 Turbo had different front lights and bumpers when compared to the Carrera and Carrera 4. The rear bumper had air vents reminiscent of those on the 959 and there were large vents on the front bumper.\n\n===997 (2005\u20132012)===\n{{Main|Porsche 997}}\n[[File:Porsche 911 (997) Carrera - Flickr - The Car Spy (11).jpg|thumb|right|997 Carrera]]\n[[File:Porsche Carrera 4S front 20080519.jpg|thumb|right|997 Carrera S]]\n[[File:Porsche 911 Carrera 4S 997.jpg|thumb|997 Carrera 4S]]\n\nThe [[Porsche 996|996]] was replaced with the [[Porsche 997|997]] in 2005. It retains the 996's basic profile, with an even lower 0.28 drag coefficient, but draws on the 993 for detailing. In addition, the new headlights revert to the original bug-eye design from the teardrop scheme of the 996. Its interior is also similarly revised, with strong links to the earlier 911 interiors while at the same time looking fresh and modern. The 997 shares less than a third of its parts with the outgoing 996, but is still technically similar to it.\n\nInitially, two versions of the 997 were introduced&mdash; the rear-wheel-drive Carrera and Carrera S. While the base 997 Carrera had a power output of 325&nbsp;PS (239&nbsp;kW) from its 3.6&nbsp;L Flat 6, a more powerful 3.8&nbsp;L 355&nbsp;PS (261&nbsp;kW) Flat 6 powers the Carrera S. Besides a more powerful engine, the Carrera S also comes standard with 19&nbsp;inch (48&nbsp;cm) \"Lobster Fork\" style wheels, more powerful and larger brakes (with red calipers), lowered suspension with PASM (Porsche Active Suspension Management: dynamically adjustable dampers), Xenon headlamps, and a sports steering wheel.\n\nIn late 2005, Porsche introduced the all-wheel-drive versions to the 997 lineup. Carrera 4 models (both Carrera 4 and Carrera 4S) were announced as 2006 models. Both Carrera 4 models are wider than their rear-wheel-drive counterparts by 1.76&nbsp;inches (32&nbsp;mm) <!-- more precisely, 32.004 mm... was that measure in mm to begin with? --> to cover wider rear tyres. The 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h (62&nbsp;mph) acceleration time for the Carrera 4S with the {{convert|355|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} engine equipped with a manual transmission was reported at 4.8&nbsp;seconds.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.carsguide.com.au/car-reviews/porsche-perfection-8935|title=Porsche 911 Carrera 4 2005 Review|date=11 November 2005|accessdate=25 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180425183625/https://www.carsguide.com.au/car-reviews/porsche-perfection-8935|archive-date=25 April 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h (62&nbsp;mph) acceleration for the Carrera S with the {{convert|355|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} was noted to be as fast as 4.2&nbsp;seconds in a ''[[Motor Trend]]'' comparison, and ''[[Road & Track]]'' has timed it at 3.8&nbsp;seconds. The 997 lineup includes both 2- and 4-wheel-drive variants, named Carrera and Carrera 4 respectively. The Targas (4 and 4S), released in November 2006, are 4-wheel-drive versions that divide the difference between the coup\u00e9s and the cabriolets with their dual, sliding glass tops.\n\n[[File:2010 Porsche 997 Carrera GTS coupe 4105x2737.jpg|thumb|right|Porsche 997 GTS]]\n\nThe 997 received a larger air intake in the front bumper, new headlights, new rear taillights, new clean-sheet design [[gasoline direct injection|direct fuel injection]] engines, and the introduction of a [[dual-clutch gearbox]] called PDK for the 2009 model year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jalopnik.com/tag/2009-porsche-911/|title=2009 Porsche 911 Details Leaked!|publisher=Jalopnik|date=25 April 2008|access-date=25 April 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080429224741/http://jalopnik.com/tag/2009-porsche-911/|archive-date=29 April 2008|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.evo.co.uk/videos/planetevovideos/223848/porsche-911.html/|title=Porsche 911|publisher=EVO|date=20 June 2008|access-date=20 June 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622144156/http://www.evo.co.uk/videos/planetevovideos/223848/porsche-911.html|archive-date=22 June 2008|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> They were also equipped with [[Bluetooth]] support.\n\nThe change to the 7th generation (991) took place in the middle of the 2012 model year. A 2012 Porsche 911 can either be a 997 or a 991, depending on the month of the production.\n\n====997 Turbo====\n[[File:Porsche 997 Turbo - Flickr - Alexandre Pr\u00e9vot (8) (cropped).jpg|thumb|997 Turbo]]\n\nThe [[Porsche 997#Turbo|Turbocharged version of the 997 series]] featured the same 3.6&nbsp;L twin-turbocharged engine as the 996 Turbo, with modifications to have a power output of {{convert|480|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|620|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque. It has VTG ([[variable geometry turbocharger|variable turbine geometry]]), that combines the low-rev boost and quick responses of a small turbocharger with the high-rev power of a larger turbocharger. It also offers higher fuel efficiency compared to the 996 Turbo.\nThe 997 Turbo features a new [[all-wheel-drive]] system, similar to the one found on the [[Porsche Cayenne|Cayenne]]. The new PTM (Porsche Traction Management) system incorporates a clutch-based system which varies the amount of torque to the wheels to avoid tire slippage. According to Porsche, redirecting torque to control oversteer or understeer results in neutral handling as well as greatly improved performance in all weather conditions.\n\nFor the face lifted 2010 model year 911 Turbo, known internally as the 997.2 (as opposed to the 997.1 2007-2009 model years), launched in August 2009,<ref name=\"autocar1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.autocar.co.uk/News/NewsArticle/AllCars/242347/ |title=Frankfurt motor show: Porsche 911 Turbo |publisher=Autocar.co.uk |date=15 September 2009 |accessdate=2011-10-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090809124956/http://www.autocar.co.uk/News/NewsArticle/AllCars/242347/ |archive-date=9 August 2009 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> the PTM system was tweaked to give a more rearward power bias. The paddle shifters for the PDK double-clutch gearbox debuted on the Turbo.<ref name=\"autocar1\"/> The turbo uses a different engine. The previous water-cooled turbo models (996 and 997) measured 3,600cc. This new engine measures 3,800cc (3.8 litres) and was first developed for the Carrera that was launched in 2008. The variable-vane twin turbochargers have also been reworked to increase responsiveness, and the intercooler and fuel system were uprated. The engine has a power output of  {{convert|493|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} which is 20&nbsp;hp more than the outgoing model.<ref name=\"autocar1\"/> The steering wheel also houses a display showing when Sport, Sport Plus and launch control have been selected through the optional Sport Chrono package.<ref name=\"autocar1\"/> Porsche claimed that the new 911 turbo will accelerate from {{convert|0|to|100|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} in 3.4 seconds, or 0&ndash;60&nbsp;mph in 3.2 seconds and could attain a top-speed of {{convert|312|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nAs with the 996 Turbo, the car featured distinctive styling cues over the Carrera models including front LED driving/parking/indicator lights mounted on a horizontal bar across the air intakes. The traditional rear wing is a variation of the 996 bi-plane unit.\n\nA new 911 Turbo S was set for production in 2010. It is a fully optioned Porsche 911 Turbo with a PDK gearbox and sports exhaust as standard. It also comes with re engineered turbo chargers to give an extra 30 horsepower increase to a total of {{convert|523|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}.\n\n====997 GT3====\n[[File:BRRacing Porsche 997 GT3 front.jpg|thumb|right|997 GT3]]\n\nThe [[Porsche 997 GT3|911 GT3]] was added to the 997 lineage on 23 February 2006. Performance figures include a  {{convert|0|-|100|km/h|mph|0}} acceleration time of 4.1&nbsp;seconds and a top speed of {{convert|310|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}, almost as fast as the Turbo. Porsche's factory reports were proven to be conservative about the performance of the car; ''Excellence'' magazine tested the 997 GT3 and recorded a 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h of 3.9&nbsp;seconds and a top speed of {{convert|312|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}. It was at that time crowned \"the best handling car in America\" by ''Motor Trend''.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n====997 GT3 RS====\n[[File:P1020080 (6935716030).jpg|left|thumb|997 GT3 RS 4.0]]\n\nThe 911 GT3 RS was announced in early 2006 as a homologation version of the GT3 RSR racing car for competition events like Sebring and the 24 Hours of Le Mans.\n\nThe drivetrain of the RS is based on the 911 GT3, except for the addition of a lightweight flywheel and closer gear ratios for further improved response under acceleration. Unlike the GT3, the RS is built on the body and chassis of the 911 Carrera 4 and Turbo, and accordingly has a wider rear track for better cornering characteristics on the track.\n\nVisually, the RS is distinguished by its distinctive colour scheme \u2013 bright orange or green with black accents, which traces its roots to the iconic Carrera RS of 1973.  The plastic rear deck lid is topped by a wide carbon-fibre rear wing.  The front airdam has been fitted with an aero splitter to improve front downforce and provide more cooling air through the radiator.\n\nThe European version of the RS is fitted with lightweight plexiglass rear windows and a factory-installed roll cage.\n\nProduction of the first generation 997 GT3 RS ended in 2009. An estimated 413 units were delivered to the US and the worldwide production run is estimated to be under 2,000 vehicles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gt3rsregistry.com/docs/HowMany.htm|title=GT3 RS Registry|publisher=GT3 RS Registry|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100404121248/http://www.gt3rsregistry.com/docs/HowMany.htm|archivedate=4 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2009, Porsche announced the second generation of the 997 GT3 RS with an enlarged 3.8-litre engine having a power output of {{convert|450|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}, a modified suspension, dynamic engine mounts, new titanium sport exhaust, and modified lightweight bodywork.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.automoblog.net/2009/08/19/new-porsche-911-gt3-rs/|title=New Porsche 911 GT3 RS|publisher=Automoblog.net|access-date=19 August 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606040140/http://www.automoblog.net/2009/08/19/new-porsche-911-gt3-rs/|archive-date=6 June 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2011, Porsche announced the third generation of the 997 GT3 RS with an enlarged 4.0-litre engine having a power output of {{convert|500|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}, Porsche designed the GT3 RS 4.0 using lightweight components such as bucket seats, carbon-fibre bonnet and front wings, and poly carbonate plastic rear windows for weight reduction, while using suspension components from the racing version.

Designed as a drivers car, the GTS was more powerful than the S, better handling via a bespoke suspension design, and positioned as a more street friendly alternative to the GT3, Porsche's track-focused 911 variant. The GTS featured race-inspired Center Lock Wheels, unique styling including a Sport Design front bumper, special rear bumper, blackout trim, side skirts borrowed from the GT2 model, brushed stainless steel \"Carrera GTS\" door sills and Alcantara trim. Many GTS' were ordered with the Alcantara delete, instead being built with leather.  The GTS was very rare in that is was a rear wheel drive Wide-Body design (44&nbsp;mm wider than a standard 911), 20&nbsp;mm lower and offered 408 HP (versus 385 HP for the S)  like the similar, limited volume Sport Classic and the Speedster.  Porsche built approximately 2,265 total GTS models for the world market, as well as a handful  designated as 2012 models.  The enthusiastic reception the GTS model received from both the motoring press and consumers, convinced Porsche to make the GTS a staple of the 911 line beginning in 2015, with the \"type 991\" 911 successor.\n\n====Speedster====\n[[File:Porsche 911 Speedster (5828928863).jpg|thumb|right|997 Speedster]]\nIn 2011, Porsche added a new 911 Speedster in a limited series of only 356 units to the 997 lineage, the number of cars produced recalling [[Porsche 356|the iconic car of the 1950s]]. It was the third 911 Speedster produced, the other two being from the [[Porsche 930|930]] and [[Porsche 964|964]] generations. The Speedster was powered by the same engine of the Carrera GTS which is rated at {{convert|414|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. It accelerated from 0 to {{convert|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}} in 4.2 seconds and attained a top speed of around {{convert|190|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}}. Only two colours were offered, Pure Blue (which was developed specifically for the Speedster) and Carrara White. (Paint To Sample versions were produced in very limited numbers and upon special request from \"loyal customers\".)\n\nThe Speedster featured a windscreen 70mm shorter than the standard 997 cabriolet while maintaining the same rake angle.\n\n===991 Series (2012 \u2013 2019)===\n{{Main|Porsche 991}}\n\n[[File:2013 Porsche 911 Carrera 4S (991) (9626546987).jpg|thumb|991 Carrera S]]\nThe [[Porsche 991|991]] introduced in 2012 is an entirely new platform, only the third since [[Porsche 911 classic|the original 911]].

The Carrera S features a 3.8-litre engine rated at {{cvt|406|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. A Power Kit (option X51) is available for the Carrera S, increasing power output to {{cvt|436|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. The new 991's overall length grows by {{cvt|2.2|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}} and wheelbase grows by {{cvt|3.9|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}} (now 96.5 in.) Overhangs are trimmed and the rear axle moves rearward at roughly {{cvt|3|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}} towards the engine (made possible by new 3-shaft transmissions whose output flanges are moved closer to the engine). There is a wider front track ({{cvt|2|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}} wider for the Carrera S). The design team for the 991 was headed by Michael Mauer.\n\nAt the front, the new 991 has wide-set headlights that are more three-dimensional. The front fender peaks are a bit more prominent, and wedgy directionals now appear to float above the intakes for the twin coolant radiators. The stretched rear 3/4 view has changed the most, with a slightly more voluminous form and thin taillights capped with the protruding lip of the bodywork. The biggest and main change in the interior is the center console, inspired by the [[Porsche Carrera GT|Carrera GT]] and adopted by the [[Porsche Panamera|Panamera]].\n\nThe 991 is the first 911 to use a predominantly [[aluminium]] construction. This means that even though the car is larger than the outgoing model, it is still up to {{convert|50|kg|lb}} lighter. The reduced weight and increased power means that both the Carrera and Carrera S are appreciably faster than the outgoing models. The 0\u201397&nbsp;km/h (60&nbsp;mph) acceleration time for the manual transmission cars are 4.6 seconds for the Carrera and 4.3 seconds for the Carrera S. When equipped with the PDK transmission, the two 991 models can accelerate from 0\u201397&nbsp;km/h in 4.4 seconds and 4.1 seconds. With the optional sports chrono package, available for the cars with the PDK transmission, the 991 Carrera can accelerate from 0\u201397&nbsp;km/h in as little as 4.2 seconds<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.porsche.com/usa/models/911/911-carrera/featuresandspecs/ |title=Technical Specs - 911 Carrera - All 911 Models |publisher=Porsche.com |accessdate=2012-08-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213191654/http://www.porsche.com/usa/models/911/911-carrera/featuresandspecs/ |archive-date=13 February 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and the Carrera S can do the same in 3.9 seconds.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.porsche.com/usa/models/911/911-carrera-s/featuresandspecs/ |title=Technical Specs - 911 Carrera S - All 911 Models |publisher=Porsche.com |accessdate=2012-08-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213192340/http://www.porsche.com/usa/models/911/911-carrera-s/featuresandspecs/ |archive-date=13 February 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nApart from the reworked PDK transmission, the new 991 is also equipped with an industry-first 7-speed manual transmission. On vehicles produced in late 2012 (2013 model year) Rev Matching is available on the 7 speed manual transmission when equipped with the Sport Chrono package. Rev-Matching is a new feature with the manual transmission that blips the throttle during downshifts (if in Sport Plus mode). Also, the 7th gear cannot be engaged unless the car is already in 5th or 6th gear.\n\nOne of Porsche's primary objectives with the new model was to improve fuel economy as well as increase performance. In order to meet these objectives, Porsche introduced a number of new technologies in the 911. One of the most controversial of these is the introduction of electromechanical power steering instead of the previous hydraulic steering. This steering helps reduce fuel consumption, but some enthusiasts feel that the precise steering feedback for which the 911 is famous is reduced with the new system.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} The cars also feature an engine stop/start system which turns the engine off at red lights, as well as a coasting system which allows the engine to idle while maintaining speed on downhill gradients on highways. This allows for up to 16% reduction in fuel consumption and emissions over the outgoing models.\n\nThe new cars also have a number of technologies aimed at improving handling. The cars include a torque vectoring system (standard on the Carrera S and optional on the Carrera) which brakes the inner wheel of the car when going into turns. This helps the car to turn in quicker and with more precision. The cars also feature hydraulic engine mounts (which help reduce the inertia of the engine when going into turns) as part of the optional sports chrono package. Active suspension management is standard on the Carrera S and optional on the Carrera. This helps improve ride quality on straights, while stiffening the suspension during aggressive driving. The new 991 is also equipped with a new feature called Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control (PDCC). Porsche claims that this new feature alone has shaved 4 seconds off the standard car's lap time around the N\u00fcrburgring. PDCC helps the car corner flat and is said to improve high-speed directional stability and outright lateral body control, but according to several reviews, the car is more prone to understeer when equipped with this new technology.\n\nIn January 2013, Porsche introduced the all-wheel-drive variants of the Carrera models. The '4' and '4S' models are distinguishable by wider tyres, marginally wider rear body-work and a red-reflector strip that sits in between the tail-lights. In terms of technology, the 4 and 4S models are equipped with an all-new variable all-wheel-drive system that sends power to the front wheels only when needed, giving the driver a sense of being in a rear-wheel-drive 911.\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:FoS20162016 0624 132727AA (27886350045).jpg|991 Turbo S\n</gallery>\n\nIn May 2013, Porsche announced changes to the model year 2014 911 Turbo and Turbo S models, increasing their power to {{cvt|520|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} on the 'Turbo', and {{cvt|560|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} on the 'Turbo S', giving them a 0&ndash;97&nbsp;km/h acceleration time of 3.2 and 2.9 seconds, respectively. A [[Four-wheel steering|rear-wheel steering]] system has also been incorporated on the Turbo models that steers the rear wheels in the opposite direction at low speeds or the same direction at high speeds to improve handling.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.automoblog.net/2013/05/06/turbo-terror-the-new-porsche-911-turbo-announced/ |title=Turbo Terror: New Porsche 911 Turbo Announced |publisher=Automoblog.net |date=6 May 2013 |accessdate=2013-05-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508120143/http://www.automoblog.net/2013/05/06/turbo-terror-the-new-porsche-911-turbo-announced/ |archive-date=8 May 2013 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> During low-speed maneuvers, this has the virtual effect of shortening the wheelbase, while at high speeds, it is virtually extending the wheelbase for higher driving stability and agility.\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Festival automobile international 2015 - Porsche 911 Targa - 003.jpg|The 991 Targa features an all-new electronically operated roof mechanism which allows it to have the original Targa design\n</gallery>\n\nIn January 2014, Porsche introduced the new model year 2015 Targa 4 and Targa 4S models.

Extensive changes were made to the engine allowing a 9,000 rpm redline from the 4.0 litre flat-six engine. Porsche's focus was on reducing internal friction to improve throttle response. Compared to the 991.1, the rear spoiler is higher and located further back to be more effective. There is a new front spoiler and changes to the rear suspension. The 991.2 GT3 brought back the choice between a manual transmission or PDK dual clutch transmission. A touring version was also introduced which comes standard with the comfort package and the manual transmission along with the deletion of the fixed rear wing and employing an electronically operated rear wing instead.\n\n====911 GT3 RS====\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Geneva International Motor Show 2018, Le Grand-Saconnex (1X7A0083).jpg|991 GT3 RS\n</gallery>\nPorsche launched the ''Renn Sport'' version of the 911 GT3 at the [[Geneva Motor Show#2015|Geneva Motor Show]] in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.topspeed.com/cars/porsche/2016-porsche-911-gt3-rs-ar115711.html#main|title=2016 Porsche 911 GT3 RS}}</ref> Compared to the 911 GT3, the front fenders are now equipped with louvers above the wheels and the rear fenders now include Turbo-like intakes, rather than an intake below the rear wing.

A four or five-speed \"Type 901\" [[manual transmission]] was available. The styling was largely penned by Ferdinand \"Butzi\" Porsche, son of [[Ferdinand Anton Ernst Porsche|Ferdinand \"Ferry\" Porsche]]. Butzi Porsche initially came up with a notchback design with proper space for seating two rear passengers but Ferry Porsche insisted that the 356's successor was to use its fastback styling. 7 prototypes were built based on Butzi Porsche's original design and were internally called the Porsche 754 T7.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.msn.com/en-ca/autos/autosclassics/the-porsche-754-t7-prototype-is-the-911s-missing-link/ar-BBUXxos|title=The Porsche 754 T7 Prototype Is The 911's Missing Link|date=2019-03-18|first=Tyler|last=Heatley|publisher=MSN|accessdate=2019-05-24}}</ref> [[Erwin Komenda]], the leader of the Porsche car body construction department who initially objected, was also involved later in the design.\n\n[[File:Bonhams - The Paris Sale 2012 - Porsche 912 'SWB' Coup\u00e9 - 1967 - 014.jpg|thumb|The 911-based 912, powered by a [[flat-4]] engine (1967)]]\n\nProduction of the 356 ended in 1965, but there was still a market for a [[Flat-4|4-cylinder]] car, particularly in the US. The [[Porsche 912|912]], introduced in the same year, served as a direct replacement, offering the de-tuned version of 356 SC's 4-cylinder, {{cvt|1582|cc|L|1|abbr=on}}, {{convert|90|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}} boxer four Type 616/36 engine inside the 911 bodywork with Type 901 four-speed manual transmission (a 5-speed manual transmission was optional).\n\nIn 1966, Porsche introduced the more powerful 911S with Type 901/02 engine having a power output of {{convert|160|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}}. Forged aluminum [[alloy wheel]]s from [[Fuchs Petrolub|Fuchs]], with a 5-spoke design, were offered for the first time.

The [[Targa top|Targa]] (meaning \"plate\" in Italian<ref>Paternie, Red Book, p. 9</ref>) version was introduced. The Targa had a [[stainless steel]]-clad roll bar, as automakers believed that proposed rollover safety requirements by the US [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) would make it difficult for fully open [[convertible (car)|convertible]]s to meet regulations for sale in the US, an important market for the 911. The name \"Targa\" came from the [[Targa Florio]] sports car road race in [[Sicily]], Italy in which Porsche had several victories until 1973. The last win in the subsequently discontinued event was scored with a 911 Carrera RS against prototypes entered by [[Ferrari]] and [[Alfa Romeo]]. The road going Targa was equipped with a removable roof panel and a removable plastic rear window (although a fixed glass version was offered from 1968).\n\n[[File:Porsche 911 2.0 Coupe IMG 0819.jpg|thumb|[[Porsche 911 classic|Porsche 911 2.0 Coupe]] (1964) at the [[Porsche Museum, Stuttgart|Porsche Museum]] in [[Stuttgart]]]]\n\n[[File:1967 Porsche 911R - Flickr - exfordy.jpg|thumb|The 911 R (1967)]]\n\nThe {{convert|110|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} 911T was also launched in 1967 with Type 901/03 engine.

The 911R with 901/22 engine had a limited production (20 in all), as this was a lightweight racing version with thin fiberglass reinforced plastic doors, a [[magnesium]] crankcase, twin overhead camshafts, and a power output of {{convert|210|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}}.\n\nA [[Semi-automatic transmission|semi-automatic]] ''Sportomatic''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportomatic.org|title=Website for Sportomatic Porsche models|publisher=Sportomatic.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728044851/http://www.sportomatic.org/|archivedate=28 July 2011|url-status=dead|accessdate=2011-10-23}}</ref> model, composed of a [[torque converter]], an [[automatic transmission|automatic clutch]], and the four-speed transmission was added in Autumn 1967.

The wheelbase for all 911 and 912 models was increased from {{convert|2211-2268|mm|in|abbr=on}}, to help as a remedy to the car's nervous handling at the limit. The overall length of the car did not change, but the rear wheels were relocated further back. Fuel injection arrived for the 911S (901/10 engine) and for a new middle model, 911E (901/09 engine).\n\nThe D series was produced from Aug. 1970 to July 1971.\nThe 2.2-litre 911E (C and D series) had lower power output of the 911/01 engine ({{convert|155|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} at 6,200&nbsp;rpm) compared to the 911S's Type 911/02 ({{convert|180|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} at 6,500&nbsp;rpm), but 911E was quicker in acceleration up to {{convert|160|km/h|mph|0}}.\n\nThe E series for 1972\u20131973 model years (August 1971 to July 1972 production) consisted of the same models, but with a new, larger {{cvt|2341|cc|L|1|abbr=on}} engine. This is known as the \"2.4&nbsp;L\" engine, despite its displacement being closer to 2.3 litres.\nThe 911E (Type 911/52 engine) and 911S (Type 911/53) used Bosch mechanical [[fuel injection]] (MFI) in all markets. For 1972 the 911T (Type 911/57) was [[carburettor|carbureted]], except in the US and some Asian markets where the 911T also came with (MFI) mechanical fuel injection (Type 911/51 engine) with power increase over European models (130&nbsp;hp) to 140&nbsp;hp commonly known as a 911T/E.\n\nWith power and torque increase, the 2.4-litre cars also got a newer, stronger transmission, identified by its Porsche type number 915. Derived from the transmission in the [[Porsche 908|908]] race car, the 915 did away with the 901 transmission's \"dog-leg\" style first gear arrangement, opting for a traditional H pattern with first gear up to the left, second gear underneath first, etc. The E series had the unusual oil filler behind the right side door, with the dry sump oil tank relocated from behind the right rear wheel to the front of it in an attempt to move the center of gravity slightly forward for better handling. An extra oil filler/inspection flap was located on the rear wing, for this reason it became known as an \"Oil Klapper\", \"\u00d6lklappe\" or \"Vierte T\u00fcr (4th door)\".\n\nThe F series (August 1972 to July 1973 production) moved the oil tank back to the original behind-the-wheel location. This change was in response to complaints that gas-station attendants often filled gasoline into the oil tank. In January 1973, US 911Ts were switched to the new [[Jetronic|K-Jetronic]] CIS (Continuous Fuel Injection) system from [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] on Type 911/91 engine.\n\n911S models also gained a small [[Spoiler (automotive)|spoiler]] under the front bumper to improve high-speed stability. The cars weighed {{convert|1050|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. The 911 ST was produced in small numbers for racing (the production run for the ST lasted from 1970 to 1971). The cars were available with engines of either {{cvt|3987|cc|L|1|abbr=on}} or {{cvt|3404|cc|L|1|abbr=on}} displacement, having a power output of {{convert|270|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} at 8,000&nbsp;rpm. Weight was down to {{convert|960|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. The cars had success at the Daytona 6 Hours, the [[Sebring 12 Hours]], the [[1000 km N\u00fcrburgring]], and the [[Targa Florio]].\n\n===911 Carrera RS (1973 and 1974)===\n[[File:1973 Porsche 911 RS Carrera (35097626702).jpg|thumb|1973 Porsche 911 Carrera RS]]\n[[File:Paris - RM auctions - 20150204 - Porsche 911 Carrera RS 2.7 Touring - 1973 - 005.jpg|thumb|Porsche 911 Carrera RS 2.7 touring]]\n\nRS stands for ''Rennsport'' in German, meaning ''race sport''. The [[Porsche Carrera|Carrera]] name was reintroduced from the 356 Carrera which had itself been named after Porsche's class victories in the [[Carrera Panamericana]] races in Mexico in the 1950s. The RS was developed to meet [[Homologation (motorsport)|motorsport homologation]] requirements. Compared to a standard 911S, the Carrera 2.7 RS had a larger engine (2,687&nbsp;cc) developing {{convert|210|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} with Bosch ([[Kugelfischer]]) mechanical fuel injection, revised and stiffened suspension, a \"ducktail\" rear spoiler, larger brakes, wider rear wheels and rear fenders, to fit 185/70VR15 & 215/60VR15 Pirelli Cinturato CN36 tyres. In RS Touring form it weighed {{convert|1075|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, in Sport Lightweight form it was about {{convert|100|kg|lb|abbr=on}} lighter, the saving coming from thin gauge steel used for parts of the body shell and also the use of thinner glass. In total, 1,580 units were made, and qualified for the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] [[Group 4 (racing)|Group 4]] class. 49 Carrera RS cars were built with {{cvt|2808|cc|L|1|abbr=on}} engines rated at {{convert|300|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}}.\n\n[[File:Porsche 911 RSR LM24.jpg|thumb|The 911 RSR]]\n\nFor the 1974 IROC Championship (which started in December 1973), 1973 Carrera RSR models were fitted with the 3.0 engine and a flat \"whale tail\" in place of the ducktail spoiler along with wide body panels and large tyres.\n\nIn 1974, Porsche developed the Carrera RS 3.0 with mechanical fuel injection rated at {{convert|230|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}}. Its price was almost twice that of the 2.7 RS, but it offered racing capability. The chassis was largely similar to that of the 1973 Carrera RSR and the braking system was from the [[Porsche 917|917]] racing car. The use of thinner metal plate panels and a minimalist interior enabled its weight to be reduced to around {{convert|900|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe Carrera RSR 3.0 was sold to racing teams and scored wins in several major sports car races of the mid-1970s. Also, a prototype Carrera RSR Turbo (with 2.1-litre engine due to a 1.4x equivalency formula) came second at the [[1974 24 Hours of Le Mans|24 Hours of Le Mans in 1974]] and won several major races, a significant event in that its engine would form the basis of many future Porsche attempts in sports car racing. This, and the earlier 917, was Porsche's commitment to [[turbocharger]] applications in its cars.\n\n===911 and 911S 2.7 (1973\u20131977)===\n\nModel year 1974 (G Series August 1973 to July 1974 production) saw three significant changes. First, the engine size was increased to 2,687&nbsp;cc achieving higher torque. Second, new impact [[Bumper (automobile)|bumpers]] conformed with low-speed protection requirements of US regulations. Thirdly, the use of K-Jetronic CIS Bosch fuel injection in two of the three models in the line up&mdash; the 911 and 911S models, retaining the narrow rear arches of the old 2.4, now had a 2.7-litre engine rated at {{convert|150|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|175|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}}, respectively. The standard 911 version, received an increase to {{convert|165|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} for Model Year 1976, which meant that starting from MY 1976, there was only a difference in power of 10&nbsp;hp between the 911 and the 911S. The engine remained a K-Jetronic 2.7-litre. The 911S 2.7 engine was rated during the entire lifespan at {{convert|175|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}}.\n\n===Carrera 2.7 MFI and CIS (1974\u20131976)===\nThe Carrera 2.7 model built for all markets, except for the United States, used the {{convert|210|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} RS 911/83 engine with Bosch mechanical fuel injection pump from the 1973 Carrera RS. These Carrera 2.7 MFI models were built from 1974 until 1976 and were mechanically identical to the 1973 Carrera RS. The Carrera 2.7 model produced for the North American markets, often referred to as the Carrera 2.7 CIS, was powered by the same 2.7-litre engine as the 911S which produced {{convert|175|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}}. The initial Carrera 2.7 models had the same welded-on rear RS flares, before switching to the SC stamped style rear flares during the middle of the 1974 production year. The Carrera 2.7 coup\u00e9s weighed in at {{convert|1075|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, the same weight as the 1973 Carrera RS Touring.\n\nFor the 1974 model year, the Carrera 2.7 was available with the \"ducktail\" rear spoiler first introduced with the 1973 Carrera RS. In the North American markets the ducktail was standard equipment for the Carrera. All other markets the ducktail was optional, except for the home German market where the ducktail had been outlawed by the T\u00dcV road homologation department. This led to the introduction of the whale tail rear spoiler, available as an option on the 1974-75 Carrera 2.7 models, as well as the newly introduced 930 Turbo.\n\nThe Carrera 2.7 was replaced by the Carrera 3.0 for the 1976 model year, except for a special run of 113 1976 Carrera 2.7 MFI coup\u00e9s were built for the German market featuring the 911/83 RS engine, with an additional 20 narrow-bodied 1976 Carrera MFI 2.7 Targas being supplied to the Belgian Gendarmerie. The 1976 Carrera 2.7 MFI Sondermodells were the last mechanically fuel injected 911 produced by Porsche, and still featured the 1973 RS engine.\n\n===912E (1976)===\n\nFor the 1976 model year, the 912E was produced for the U.S. market. This was 4-cylinder version of the 911 in the same manner as the 912 that had last been produced in 1969. It used the I-series chassis powered by the [[Volkswagen]] 2.0 engine also used in the [[Porsche 914]] for 1973 through 1975 model years. 2,099 units were produced. The 912E was replaced by the front-engine [[Porsche 924]] for the 1977 model year.\n\n===Carrera 3.0 (1976\u20131977)===\n\n[[File:Porsche 911 Carrera 3.0.JPG|thumbnail|left|Porsche 911 Carrera 3.0]]\n[[File:Porsche 911 Carrera 3.0 1976.JPG|thumbnail|right|Porsche 911 Carrera 3.0]]\n\nFor the 1976 model year, Porsche introduced the Carrera 3.0 with wide rear flares, optional whaletail, and a variety of other luxury options. It was available in all markets except North America. The Carrera 3.0 was fitted with a variation of the 930 Turbo's 2994&nbsp;cc engine (minus the [[turbocharger]]). The engine (dubbed the 930/02) featured K-Jetronic CIS. It developed {{convert|200|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} in contrast to the older Carrera 2.7 MFI model's {{convert|210|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}}. The crankcase and gearbox housing were made of aluminium rather than magnesium for improved reliability. Magnesium cases were renown for thermal expansion/contraction issues as engines grew in displacement and heat generation also increased.\n\nThe new engine, which featured bigger intake and exhaust valves, produced greater torque allowing the Carrera 3.0 to achieve the same performance as the previous Carrera 2.7, {{convert|0|\u2013|100|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} in 6.1 seconds and {{convert|0|\u2013|200|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} in 27 seconds. Both versions boasted a top speed of approximately {{convert|236|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.\n\nWeight increased marginally by {{convert|45|kg|lb|abbr=on}} to {{convert|1120|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe 911 Carrera 3.0 was produced in both targa (1,125 examples produced) and coup\u00e9 (2,566) versions. The Carrera 3.0 was available with manual gearbox (type 915) with 4 or 5 speeds as well as 3-speed automatic transmission (called the Sportomatic). Production totals were 3,691 manual cars and 58 Sportomatic cars.\n\n===930 Turbo and Turbo Carrera 3.0-litre (1975\u20131977)===\n{{Main|Porsche 930}}\n[[File:Nationale oldtimerdag Zandvoort 2010, Red Porsche.JPG|thumb|Porsche 911 Turbo (930)]]\nFor the 1975 model year, Porsche introduced the first production [[turbocharged]] 911. Although called the 930 Turbo (930 being its internal type number) in Europe, it was marketed as the 930 Turbo Carrera in North America. The body shape incorporated wide wheel-arches to accommodate the wide 205/50R15 & 225/50R15 Pirelli P7 tyres, and a large rear spoiler often known as a \"[[Whale tail (automotive spoiler)|whale tail]]\" on the early cars (modified from the original 1974 IROC design). They were initially fitted with a 3.0-litre engine {{convert|260|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} and four-speed manual transmission.\n\n[[File:Porsche 934 Turbo (9224976479).jpg|thumb|The Porsche 934, one of the first racing versions of the 930 Turbo]]\n[[File:1979 Porsche 935 (20202549045).jpg|thumb|The Porsche 935 known for its signature \"slant nose\" front]]\n\nProduction of the first 400 units qualified the 930 for FIA Group 4 competition. With the racing version called the [[Porsche 934]] of 1976 participating at the [[Le Mans 24 Hours|24 Hours of Le Mans]] and other races including battles with the [[BMW E9|BMW 3.0 CSL \"Batmobile\"]]. The [[Group 5 (racing)|FIA Group 5]] version called [[Porsche 935]] evolved from the 934. Fitted with a slope nose or \"slant nose\", the 500+ PS car was campaigned in 1976 by the factory, winning the world championship title. Private teams went on to win many races, like Le Mans in 1979, and continued to compete successfully with the car well into the 1980s until the FIA and IMSA rules were changed.\n\n===930 Turbo 3.3-litre (1978\u20131989)===\n{{Main|Porsche 930}}\n[[File:12-01-03-autostadtl-by-RalfR-81.jpg|thumb|Porsche 930 3.3-litre, distinguished by its raised \"whale-tail\" rear wing]]\n\nFor the 1978 model year, Porsche revised the 930 with a larger 3.3-litre [[turbocharged]] engine with intercooler rated at {{convert|300|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}}. To fit the intercooler a newly designed \"tea-tray\" tail spoiler replaced the earlier whale tail spoiler. Porsche dropped the \"Carrera\" nomenclature for the North American markets and the car was simply called the Porsche 911 Turbo worldwide. The larger engine helped reduce some of the turbo lag inherent in the earlier models.\n\nIn 1989, a 5-speed manual transmission became available for the 930. The 930 was replaced in 1990 with the [[Porsche 964|964]] turbo featuring the same 3.3-litre engine. There have been turbocharged variants of each subsequent generation of 911 since then.\n\n===911SC (1978\u20131983)===\n\n[[File:1983Porsche911SC.JPG|thumb|1983 Porsche 911 Super Carrera, the last production year of the Super Carrera]]\n[[File:1000pistestoivonen84.jpg|thumb|[[Henri Toivonen]] at ''rallye des 1000 pistes'' in 1984 on a Porsche 911 SC RS]]\n\nIn 1978, Porsche introduced the new version of the 911, called the '911SC'. Porsche reintroduced the SC designation for the first time since the 356SC (as distinguished from the race engined 356 Carrera). There was no Carrera version of the 911SC. The \"SC\" stands for \"Super Carrera\". It featured a 3.0-litre aluminum engine with Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection and a 5-speed 915 transmission. Originally power output was {{convert|180|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}}, later {{convert|191|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} and then in 1981 it was increased to {{convert|204|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}}. The move to an aluminum engine was to regain case reliability, something missing for many years with magnesium. In 1981 a Cabriolet concept car was introduced at the [[Frankfurt Motor Show]]. The [[convertible]] body design also featured [[four-wheel drive]], although this was dropped in the production version. The first 911 Cabriolet debuted in late 1982, as a 1983 model. This was Porsche's first cabriolet since the [[Porsche 356|356]] of the mid-1960s. A total of 4,214 were sold in its introductory year, despite its premium price relative to the open-top targa.<ref name=Seventy>P. 77 Paternie, P (2000). Porsche 911 Red Book 1965\u20131999 Motorbooks International. {{ISBN|0-7603-0723-7}}</ref> Cabriolet versions of the 911 have been offered ever since.\n\nIn 1979, Porsche had made plans to replace the 911 with their new [[Porsche 928|928]] company [[halo car|flagship]]. Sales of the 911 remained so strong however, that Porsche revised its strategy and decided to inject new life into the 911 editions. 911 SC sales totaled 58,914 cars.<ref name=Seventy/>\n\n[[Peter W. Schutz]] (CEO Porsche AG 1981\u20131987) wrote: {{quotation|\nThe decision to keep the 911 in the product line occurred one afternoon in the office of Dr. Helmuth Bott [[:de:Helmuth Bott]], the Porsche operating board member responsible for all engineering and development. I noticed a chart on the wall of Professor Bott's office. It depicted the ongoing development schedules for the three primary Porsche product lines: [[Porsche 944|944]], 928 and 911. Two of them stretched far into the future, but the 911 program stopped at the end of 1981. I remember rising from my chair, walking over to the chart, taking a black marker pen, and extending the 911 program bar clean off the chart. I am sure I heard a silent cheer from Professor Bott, and I knew I had done the right thing. The Porsche 911, the company icon, had been saved, and I believe the company was saved with it.<ref>Corlett, p. 6</ref>}}\n\n===Carrera 3.2 (1984\u20131989)===\n\n[[File:1987 911carrera Jubi Targa und TLcabrio.jpg|thumb|right|1987 Porsche 911 ''Carrera Cabriolet'' and \"Carrera Targa\"]]\n\nThe replacement for the SC series came in 1984 as the 911 3.2 Carrera, reviving the Carrera name for the first time since 1977. This was the last iteration in the original 911 series, with all subsequent models featuring new body styling and new brake, electronic, and suspension technologies.\n\nA new higher-displacement engine, a 3.2-litre horizontally opposed flat 6-cylinder unit, was utilized. At the time Porsche claimed it was 80% new.<ref>Corlett, p. 13</ref> The new swept volume of 3,164 cc was achieved using the {{convert|95|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} bore (from the previous SC model) combined with the 1978 Turbo 3.3 crankshaft's {{convert|74.4|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} stroke. In addition, higher domed pistons increased the compression ratio from 9.8 to 10.3:1 (9.5:1 for the US market). New inlet manifold and exhaust systems were fitted. The 915 transmission was carried over from the SC series for the first three model years. In 1987, the Carrera got a new five-speed gearbox sourced from [[Getrag]], model number G50 with proven [[BorgWarner]] synchronizers. This slightly heavier version also featured a hydraulically operated clutch.\n\nWith the new engine, power was increased to {{convert|207|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}} (at 5,900&nbsp;rpm) for North American-delivered cars and to {{convert|237|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} (at 5,900&nbsp;rpm) for most other markets. This version of the 911 accelerated {{convert|0|\u2013|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}} in 5.4 seconds and had a top speed of {{convert|150|mph|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}} as measured by ''[[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]]''. Factory figures were more modest: 0\u201360&nbsp;mph time of 6.3 seconds for the US version and 6.1 seconds for cars outside the American market.\n\nThe brake discs were increased in size to aid in more effective heat dissipation and improved oil-fed chain tensioners were fitted to the engine. To improve oil cooling, a finned cooler replaced the serpentine lines in the front passenger fender well. This was further improved in 1987, with the addition of a thermostatically controlled fan.\n\nDriving refinement and motor reliability were improved with an upgrade of the fuel and [[Ignition system|ignition]] control components to an [[Jetronic|L-Jetronic]] with Bosch Motronics 2 DME (Digital Motor Electronics system). An improvement in fuel-efficiency was due to the DME providing a petrol cut-off on the overrun. Changes in the fuel map and chip programming from October 1986 further improved the power to {{convert|217|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}} (at 5,900&nbsp;rpm) for North American delivered cars as well as for other markets mandating low emissions, like Germany.\n\nThree basic models were available \u2013 coup\u00e9, targa and cabriolet. The Carrera is almost indistinguishable from the SC with the external clue being the front fog lights that were integrated into the front valance. Only cosmetic changes were made during the production of the Carrera, with a redesigned dashboard featuring larger air conditioning vents appearing in 1986.\n\nIn 1984, Porsche also introduced the M491 option. Officially called the Supersport in the UK, it was commonly known as the \"Turbo-look\".{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} It was a style that resembled the 930 Turbo with wide wheel arches and the distinctive \"tea tray\" tail. It featured the stiffer suspension shared with the turbo and the superior turbo braking system as well as the wider turbo wheels. Sales of the Supersport were high for its first two years in the United States because the desirable 930 was not available.\n\n[[File:Porsche Carrera CS registered August 1988 3164cc.jpg|thumb|right|1988 Porsche Carrera CS]]\n\nIn 1985, Porsche introduced the first Carrera Club Sport prototype with the identification number WP0ZZZ91ZF100848. Later on in that year, a 911 Club Sport Row (Rest Of World) with the identification number WP0ZZZ91ZFS101166 was special ordered for a Porsche driver that was particularly inspired by the CS prototype on the track. From 1987 to September 1989, Porsche decided to produced 340 units for their customers that wanted a track inspired road car, The 911 Carrera Club Sport (CS) (option M637), is a reduced weight version of the standard Carrera purposely built for club racing, it gained engine and suspension modifications. The CS had a blueprinted engine with hollow intake valves and a higher rev limit, deletion of: all power options, sunroof (except one unit), air conditioning (except two units), radio, rear seat, undercoating, sound insulation, rear wiper, door pocket lids, fog lamps, front hood locking mechanism, engine and luggage compartment lights, lockable wheel nuts and even the rear lid \"Carrera\" logo, all in order to save an estimated {{convert|70|kg|lb|abbr=on}} in weight. With the exception of CS cars delivered to the UK, all are identifiable by the \"CS Club Sport\" decal on the left front fender and came in a variety of colors, some special ordered. Some U.S. CS cars did not have the decal installed by the dealer; however, all have a \"SP\" stamp on the crankcase and cylinder head. The UK cars were all finished \"Grand Prix White\" with a red \"Carrera CS\" decal on each side of the car and red wheels. Although the CS was well received by the club racers, because it cost more than the standard 911, but had fewer comfort features. According to Porsche Club of America and Porsche Club Great Britain CS Registers, 21 are documented as delivered to the U.S. in 1988 with 7 in 1989, one to Canada in 1988 and 53 to the United Kingdom from 1987 to 1989.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nIn 1988, Porsche produced 875 examples of the CE or Commemorative Edition 911 Carrera in coupe, targa and cabriolet variants to mark the production of the 250,000th 911. Distinguishing features include special diamond blue metallic paint with color-matched Fuchs wheels, front and rear spoilers, and interior carpets and leather. These cars also featured Dr. Ferdinand Porsche's signature embroidered on the seats in the headrest area. Of the 875 examples produced, only 300 were imported to the US (120 coupes, 100 cabrios and 80 Targas),  250 were sold in Germany, 50 went to the UK, and the remainder to other countries.\n\nFor 1989, Porsche produced the 25th Anniversary Special Edition model to mark the 25th year of 911 production. The 1989 Porsche brochure lists production of 500 U.S. market cars, of which 300 were coup\u00e9s (240 in silver metallic paint and 60 in satin black metallic, and 200 cabriolet models (160 in silver and 40 in black). All had \"silk grey\" leather with black accent piping and silk grey velour carpeting. Included were body color Fuchs wheels in 6x16 (front) and 8x16 (rear), stitched leather console with an outside temperature gauge and a CD or cassette holder, a limited slip differential, and a short shifting gear lever, as well as small bronze \"25th Anniversary Special Edition\" badges\n\n[[File:Porsche-32-speedster.jpg|thumb|Porsche 911 Carrera 3.2 Speedster]]\n\nThe 911 Speedster (option M503), a low-roof version of the Cabriolet which was evocative of the 356 Speedster of the 1950s, was produced in limited numbers (2,104 units) starting in January 1989 until July 1989 as both a narrow body car and a Turbo-look. The narrow version production was 171 units. The Speedster started as a design under Helmuth Bott<!-- [http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmuth_Bott] --> in 1983 but was not manufactured until six years later. It was a two-seat convertible that featured a low swept windshield.<ref>Corlett, p. 45</ref>\n\nTotal production of the 911 3.2 Carrera series was 76,473 cars (35,670 coup\u00e9, 19,987 cabrio, 18,468 targa).<ref>Corlett, p. 74</ref>\n\nAccording to the manufacturer, around 150,000 of the 911 cars from the model years 1964 to 1989 are still on the road today.<ref>{{cite press release |url= http://newsroom.porsche.com/en/products/a-fountain-of-youth-for-classic-cars-10719.html |title= A fountain of youth |publisher= newsroom.porsche |date= 27 June 2014 |accessdate= 27 June 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150626152858/http://newsroom.porsche.com/en/products/a-fountain-of-youth-for-classic-cars-10719.html |archive-date= 26 June 2015 |url-status= live |df= dmy-all }}</ref>\n{{-}}\n\n===964 Series (1989\u20131993)===\n{{Main|Porsche 964}}\n[[File:1990 Porsche 911 Carrera 2 (803367948).jpg|thumb|1990 Porsche 911 ''Carrera 2'']]\n\nIn late 1989, the 911 underwent a major evolution with the introduction of the Type 964. With technologies from the [[Porsche 959|959]] flagship model, this would be an important car for Porsche, since the world economy was undergoing [[recession]] and the company could not rely on its image alone. It was launched as the Carrera 4, the \"4\" indicating [[four-wheel-drive]], demonstrating the company's commitment to engineering. [[Drag coefficient]] was down to 0.32. A rear spoiler deployed at high speed, preserving the purity of design when the vehicle was at rest. The chassis was redesigned overall. Coil springs, [[ABS brakes]] and [[power steering]] made their debut. The engine was increased in size to 3,600&nbsp;cc and was rated at 250&nbsp;PS (184&nbsp;kW). The [[rear-wheel-drive]] version, the Carrera 2, arrived a year later.\n\nThe [[Porsche 911#964 Turbo (1990\u20131994)|964 incarnation of the 911 Turbo]] returned in 1990 after an absence from the price lists. At first it used a refined version of the 3.3&nbsp;L engine of the previous Turbo, but two years later a turbocharged engine based on the 3.6&nbsp;L engine of the other 964 models was introduced.\n\nIn 1990, Porsche introduced the ahead-of-its-time [[Tiptronic]] automatic transmission in the 964 Carrera 2, featuring adaptive electronic management and full manual control. The 964 was one of the first cars in the world offered with dual [[airbags]] standard (from 1991), the first being the [[Porsche 944 Turbo|944 Turbo]] (from 1987).\n\n[[File:Porsche Carrera RS - Flickr - Alexandre Pr\u00e9vot.jpg|thumb|Porsche 964 Carrera RS]]\n\nIn 1992, Porsche re-introduced a limited-edition RS model, inspired by the 1973 Carrera RS and emissions-legal in Europe only. In 1993, appeals from American customers resulted in Porsche developing the RS America of which 701 units were built. In 1994, the RS America returned with rear seats. A total of 84 RS America cars were made in 1994. However, while European RS was a homologation special, RS America was an option delete variant of the regular model. The RS 3.8 of 1993 had Turbo-style bodywork, a larger fixed whale tail in place of the electrictronically operated rear spoiler, and a 300&nbsp;PS (221&nbsp;kW) {{cvt|3746|cc|L|1|abbr=on}} engine.\n\nSince the RS/RS America was intended as a no-compromise, higher performance version of the 964, there were four factory options available: a [[limited-slip differential]], AM/FM [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] stereo, air conditioning, and a sunroof. The interior was more basic than a standard 911 as well; for example the interior door panels lacked the armrests and door pockets and had a simple pull strap for the opening mechanism.\n\n====964 Turbo (1990\u20131994)====\n[[File:Porsche 911-964 turbo 1990-1993 frontright 2009-10-04 U.jpg|thumb|left|Porsche 964 Turbo]]\n\nIn 1990 Porsche introduced a [[1991-1992 Porsche 964 Turbo Technical Data|Turbocharged version]] of the 964 series. This car is sometimes mistakenly called 965 (this type number actually referred to a [[Porsche 969|stillborn project]] that would have been a hi-tech turbocharged car in the vein of the 959). For the 1991 through 1993 model years, Porsche produced the 964 Turbo with the 930's proven 3.3&nbsp;L engine, improved to have a power output of 320&nbsp;PS (235&nbsp;kW). 1994 brought the Carrera 2/4's 3.6&nbsp;L engine, now in turbocharged form and sending a staggering {{convert|360|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} to the rear wheels. With the 993 on the way, this car was produced through 1994 and remains rather rare.\n\n===993 Series (1994\u2013mid 1998)===\n{{Main|Porsche 993}}\n[[File:1996 Porsche 911 993 GT2 - Flickr - The Car Spy (4).jpg|thumb|right|The mid-nineties Type 993 had sleeker bodywork. This is the high-performance GT2 variant]]\n\nThe 911 was again revised for model year 1994 under the internal name Type 993. This car was significant as it was the final incarnation of the [[air-cooled]] 911 first introduced in 1964.  Most enthusiasts and collectors consider the 993 to be the best of the air-cooled 911 series.  As Car & Driver noted, \"Porsche's version of the Goldilocks tale is the 993-generation 911, the one many Porschephiles agree that the company got just right,\" with an \"ideal blend of technology and classic 911 air-cooled heritage.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=1995\u201398 Porsche 911 Carrera Buyer's Guide [Econo-Exotics] |url=http://blog.caranddriver.com/1995-98-porsche-911-carrera-buyers-guide-econo-exotics/ |date=2 May 2013 |first=James |last=Tate |work=Car and Driver |accessdate=24 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319183643/http://blog.caranddriver.com/1995-98-porsche-911-carrera-buyers-guide-econo-exotics/ |archive-date=19 March 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>  Porsche itself refers to the 993 as \"a significant advance, not just from a technical, but also a visual perspective.\"<ref>http://www.porsche.com/usa/accessoriesand services/classic/models/993/993/</ref> \"993s especially [are] widely regarded as the best the 911 ever got.\"<ref>James Edition, 28 April 2015, \"The Classic Porsche 911 Market Continues to Surprise.\"</ref>\n\nThe exterior featured all-new front and rear ends. The revised bodywork was smoother, having a noticeably more aerodynamic front end somewhat reminiscent of the [[Porsche 959|959]]. Styling was by Englishman Tony Hatter under the supervision of design chief [[Harm Lagaay]] and was completed in 1991.\n\nAlong with the revised bodywork, mechanically the 993 also featured an all-new multilink rear suspension that improved the car's ride and handling. This rear suspension was largely derived from the stillborn [[Porsche 989]]'s rear multilink design, and served to rectify the problems with earlier models' tendency to oversteer if the throttle or brakes were applied mid-corner. These modifications also reduced previous 911's lift-off oversteer problems to a much more moderate degree.\n\n[[File:Porsche 993 RS Clubsport (3).jpg|thumb|The Porsche 993 Carrera RS continued the tradition of a light weight and minimalist 911 beginning with the 1973 Carrera RS]]\n\nThe new suspension, along with chassis refinements, enabled the car to keep up dynamically with the competition. Engine capacity remained at 3.6&nbsp;L, but power rose to 272&nbsp;PS (200&nbsp;kW / 268&nbsp;hp) due to better engine management and exhaust design, and beginning with model year 1996 to 286&nbsp;PS (210&nbsp;kW / 281&nbsp;hp). The 993 was the first Porsche to debut variable-length intake runners with the \"Varioram\" system on 1996 models. This addressed the inherent compromise between high-rpm power production and low-rpm torque production, and was one of the first of its kind to be employed on production vehicles. However, the Varioram version with its OBD II had issues with carbon deposits, resulting in failed smog tests. This caused expensive repairs, and made comparisons with the 1995 car (with OBD I and just 12&nbsp;hp less) inevitable. Meanwhile, a new four-wheel-drive system was introduced as an option in the form of the Carrera 4, the [[rear-wheel drive|rear-wheel-drive]] versions simply being called Carrera or C2. A lightweight RS variant had a 3.8&nbsp;L engine rated at 300&nbsp;PS (221&nbsp;kW / 296&nbsp;hp), and was only rear-wheel drive.\n\n[[File:Porsche, Techno-Classica 2018, Essen (IMG 9738).jpg|thumb|right|The Porsche 993 Targa had a departure from the classic Targa design, incorporating an expensive glass sliding roof mechanism]]\n\nThe Targa open-topped model also made a return, this time with a large glass roof that slid under the rear window. The expensive air-cooled 993 Targa had a limited production run between 1996 and 1998.

The similarity in specification and in performance levels inspired several comparison road tests with the 959.<ref>(f.e. [[Car and Driver]], July 1997, p. 63)</ref> The 3.6&nbsp;L twin-turbocharged M64/60 engine is rated at 408&nbsp;PS (300&nbsp;kW / 402&nbsp;hp). The performance was outstanding at the time, as 0 to 97&nbsp;km/h (60&nbsp;mph) has been measured at 3.2 seconds, and the braking was even more impressive in 2.3 seconds from the same speed. The car's top speed was measured at {{cvt|200|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} at 7,000 rpm. The differences were striking - the 959 had a much smaller engine, sequential turbocharging and a computer controlled all wheel drive system. The 993 turbo had parallel turbochargers, 3.6 litres of displacement, and a viscous coupling for the center differential in the AWD drivetrain. The turbo was only produced in 1996 and 1997 model years. The main difference was that the ECU in the 1996 model year could not be flashed for an upgrade, while the 1997 could. Additionally, the 1996 year had Porsche crested centre caps on the wheels, while the 1997 had turbo inscribed. Another difference is the motion sensor and map lights above the interior rear view mirror on the 1997 while the 1996 had no such devices.\n\nIn 1997, Porsche introduced a limited run of 183 units of the Sport version of the 993 turbo dubbed the turbo S. With 24&nbsp;PS (17.7&nbsp;kW) over the regular Turbo's 408&nbsp;PS (300&nbsp;kW), features include a scoop on the side right behind the doors for engine cooling and vents on the whale tail rear spoiler. Aside from an upgraded ECU mapping, a centre oil cooler behind the centre air intake at the front bumper was added.\n\n==Water-cooled engines (1998\u2013present)==\n\n===996 (1998/9\u20132004)===\n{{Main|Porsche 996}}\n\n[[File:2002 911C4S.JPG|thumb|right|2002 [[Porsche 996|996]] Carrera 4S]]\nThe Type 996 introduced in 1998 represented two major changes for the venerable 911 lineage: a [[water-cooled]] flat-6 engine replaced the popular air-cooled engine used in the 911 for 34&nbsp;years, and the body shell received its first major re-design. Changing to a water-cooled engine was controversial with Porsche traditionalists, who noted this as the end of the 'true' 911.\n\nThe 996 styling shared its front end with Porsche's mid engine entry-level [[Porsche Boxster|Boxster]]. Pinky Lai's work on the exterior won international design awards between 1997 and 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.designnstyling.com/|title=::Design & Styling|work=designnstyling.com|accessdate=24 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150129123936/http://www.designnstyling.com/|archive-date=29 January 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe Carrera variant had a 0.30 [[coefficient of drag]]. The interior was criticized for its plainness and its lack of relationship to prior 911 interiors, although this came largely from owners of older 911s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autosport911.com/porsche911.html|title=AutoSport911|publisher=autosport911.com|accessdate=26 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127201500/http://www.autosport911.com/porsche911.html|archive-date=27 November 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe Type 996 spawned over a dozen variations, including an all-wheel-drive Carrera 4 and Carrera 4S (the latter which had a 'Turbo look' in facelift form) models, the club racing-oriented [[Porsche 911 GT3|GT3]] and GT3 RS instead of a Carrera RS variant and the [[turbocharging|forced-induction]] 996 Turbo and [[Porsche 911 GT2|GT2]]. The Turbo, which was four-wheel-drive and had a  [[twin-turbocharged]] engine, often made appearances in magazines' lists of the best cars on sale.\n\nThe Carrera and Carrera 4 underwent revisions for 2002 model year, receiving clear lens front and rear indicator lights which were first seen on the Turbo version two years earlier. This allowed the 911 to be more distinguishable from the Boxster. A mildly revised front fascia was also introduced, though the basic architecture remained.\n\nEngine displacement was 3.4&nbsp;L and power \noutput was {{convert|300|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} featuring a change to an \"integrated dry sump\" design and variable valve timing. The displacement was increased in 2002 to 3.6&nbsp;L and power received an increase to 320&nbsp;PS (235&nbsp;kW).\n\nThe folding roof mechanism on the convertible variants required 19 seconds for operation. An electronically adjustable rear spoiler was installed that raised at speeds over 120&nbsp;km/h (75&nbsp;mph). It could also be raised manually by means of an electric switch.\n\nStarting from the models with water-cooled engines, all variants of the 911 Carrera do not come with rear [[limited-slip differential]], except the 40th Anniversary 911, GT2, GT3 and Turbo. The exception would be for MY1999 where the limited-slip differential was available as option code 220.{{citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=June 2012}}\n\n====996 GT3 (1999\u20132004)====\n[[File:Porsche 996 GT3 - Flickr - Alexandre Pr\u00e9vot (3).jpg|thumb|left|996 GT3]]\n[[File:Porsche exhibition at Oca, Parque do Ibirapuera 2018 057.jpg|thumb|right|996 GT3 RS]]\n\nPorsche introduced a road legal GT3 version of the 996 series which was derived from the company's racing car used in the GT3 class racing. Simply called GT3, the car featured lightweight materials including thinner windows and deletion of the rear seats. The GT3 was a lighter and more focused design with the emphasis on handling and performance, a concept that dates back to the 1973 Carrera RS. The suspension ride height was lowered and tuned for responsiveness over compliance and comfort. These revisions improved handling and steering. Of more significance was the engine used in the GT3. Instead of using a version of the water-cooled units found in other 996 models, the naturally aspirated engine was derived from the [[Porsche 911 GT1#1998|911 GT1 '98]] sports-prototype racing car and featured lightweight materials which enabled the engine to have higher rpm.\n\nThe engine used was a naturally aspirated {{cvt|3600|cc|L|1|abbr=on}} flat-six rather than the engine from the pre-facelift and revised Carrera. It is rated at {{convert|365|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at first and later improved to {{convert|386|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} at the end of the 996 series' revision.\n\n====996 Turbo (2001\u20132005)====\n[[File:Porsche 996 Turbo - Flickr - Alexandre Pr\u00e9vot (15).jpg|thumb|996 Turbo]]\n\n[[File:Techno Classica 2018, Essen (IMG 0015).jpg|thumb|right|996 Turbo S]]\n\nIn 2000, Porsche launched the turbocharged version of the Type 996 for the 2001 model year. Like the GT3, the Turbo's engine was derived from the engine used in the 911 GT1 and, like its predecessor, featured twin-turbos and now had a power output of {{cvt|420|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Two/> Also like its predecessor, the new Turbo was only available with all-wheel drive. In 2002, the X50 package was available that increased the engine output to {{cvt|450|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} with {{cvt|620|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque across a wide section of the power band. With the X50 package, the car could accelerate from 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h (0\u201362&nbsp;mph) in 3.91&nbsp;seconds. Later on toward the end of the 996 life cycle, the Turbo S nameplate also returned with the debut of the cabriolet variant as well. The Turbo S boasted even more power&mdash; 450&nbsp;PS (331&nbsp;kW) and 620&nbsp;N\u00b7m (457&nbsp;lb\u00b7ft<sub>f</sub>)&mdash; than the standard Turbo courtesy of the X50 package being standard. The Turbo S was limited to 1,500 units worldwide. The Turbo can attain a top speed of {{convert|189|mph|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}}.<ref name=Two>Paternie, p. 92</ref>\n\nThe styling was more individual than the previous generations of the Turbo. Along with the traditional wider rear wing, the 996 Turbo had different front lights and bumpers when compared to the Carrera and Carrera 4. The rear bumper had air vents reminiscent of those on the 959 and there were large vents on the front bumper.\n\n===997 (2005\u20132012)===\n{{Main|Porsche 997}}\n[[File:Porsche 911 (997) Carrera - Flickr - The Car Spy (11).jpg|thumb|right|997 Carrera]]\n[[File:Porsche Carrera 4S front 20080519.jpg|thumb|right|997 Carrera S]]\n[[File:Porsche 911 Carrera 4S 997.jpg|thumb|997 Carrera 4S]]\n\nThe [[Porsche 996|996]] was replaced with the [[Porsche 997|997]] in 2005. It retains the 996's basic profile, with an even lower 0.28 drag coefficient, but draws on the 993 for detailing. In addition, the new headlights revert to the original bug-eye design from the teardrop scheme of the 996. Its interior is also similarly revised, with strong links to the earlier 911 interiors while at the same time looking fresh and modern. The 997 shares less than a third of its parts with the outgoing 996, but is still technically similar to it.\n\nInitially, two versions of the 997 were introduced&mdash; the rear-wheel-drive Carrera and Carrera S. While the base 997 Carrera had a power output of 325&nbsp;PS (239&nbsp;kW) from its 3.6&nbsp;L Flat 6, a more powerful 3.8&nbsp;L 355&nbsp;PS (261&nbsp;kW) Flat 6 powers the Carrera S. Besides a more powerful engine, the Carrera S also comes standard with 19&nbsp;inch (48&nbsp;cm) \"Lobster Fork\" style wheels, more powerful and larger brakes (with red calipers), lowered suspension with PASM (Porsche Active Suspension Management: dynamically adjustable dampers), Xenon headlamps, and a sports steering wheel.\n\nIn late 2005, Porsche introduced the all-wheel-drive versions to the 997 lineup. Carrera 4 models (both Carrera 4 and Carrera 4S) were announced as 2006 models. Both Carrera 4 models are wider than their rear-wheel-drive counterparts by 1.76&nbsp;inches (32&nbsp;mm) <!-- more precisely, 32.004 mm... was that measure in mm to begin with? --> to cover wider rear tyres. The 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h (62&nbsp;mph) acceleration time for the Carrera 4S with the {{convert|355|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} engine equipped with a manual transmission was reported at 4.8&nbsp;seconds.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.carsguide.com.au/car-reviews/porsche-perfection-8935|title=Porsche 911 Carrera 4 2005 Review|date=11 November 2005|accessdate=25 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180425183625/https://www.carsguide.com.au/car-reviews/porsche-perfection-8935|archive-date=25 April 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h (62&nbsp;mph) acceleration for the Carrera S with the {{convert|355|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} was noted to be as fast as 4.2&nbsp;seconds in a ''[[Motor Trend]]'' comparison, and ''[[Road & Track]]'' has timed it at 3.8&nbsp;seconds. The 997 lineup includes both 2- and 4-wheel-drive variants, named Carrera and Carrera 4 respectively.

It has VTG ([[variable geometry turbocharger|variable turbine geometry]]), that combines the low-rev boost and quick responses of a small turbocharger with the high-rev power of a larger turbocharger. It also offers higher fuel efficiency compared to the 996 Turbo.\nThe 997 Turbo features a new [[all-wheel-drive]] system, similar to the one found on the [[Porsche Cayenne|Cayenne]]. The new PTM (Porsche Traction Management) system incorporates a clutch-based system which varies the amount of torque to the wheels to avoid tire slippage. According to Porsche, redirecting torque to control oversteer or understeer results in neutral handling as well as greatly improved performance in all weather conditions.\n\nFor the face lifted 2010 model year 911 Turbo, known internally as the 997.2 (as opposed to the 997.1 2007-2009 model years), launched in August 2009,<ref name=\"autocar1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.autocar.co.uk/News/NewsArticle/AllCars/242347/ |title=Frankfurt motor show: Porsche 911 Turbo |publisher=Autocar.co.uk |date=15 September 2009 |accessdate=2011-10-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090809124956/http://www.autocar.co.uk/News/NewsArticle/AllCars/242347/ |archive-date=9 August 2009 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> the PTM system was tweaked to give a more rearward power bias.

The variable-vane twin turbochargers have also been reworked to increase responsiveness, and the intercooler and fuel system were uprated. The engine has a power output of  {{convert|493|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} which is 20&nbsp;hp more than the outgoing model.<ref name=\"autocar1\"/> The steering wheel also houses a display showing when Sport, Sport Plus and launch control have been selected through the optional Sport Chrono package.<ref name=\"autocar1\"/> Porsche claimed that the new 911 turbo will accelerate from {{convert|0|to|100|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} in 3.4 seconds, or 0&ndash;60&nbsp;mph in 3.2 seconds and could attain a top-speed of {{convert|312|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nAs with the 996 Turbo, the car featured distinctive styling cues over the Carrera models including front LED driving/parking/indicator lights mounted on a horizontal bar across the air intakes. The traditional rear wing is a variation of the 996 bi-plane unit.\n\nA new 911 Turbo S was set for production in 2010. It is a fully optioned Porsche 911 Turbo with a PDK gearbox and sports exhaust as standard.

Unlike the GT3, the RS is built on the body and chassis of the 911 Carrera 4 and Turbo, and accordingly has a wider rear track for better cornering characteristics on the track.\n\nVisually, the RS is distinguished by its distinctive colour scheme \u2013 bright orange or green with black accents, which traces its roots to the iconic Carrera RS of 1973.  The plastic rear deck lid is topped by a wide carbon-fibre rear wing.  The front airdam has been fitted with an aero splitter to improve front downforce and provide more cooling air through the radiator.\n\nThe European version of the RS is fitted with lightweight plexiglass rear windows and a factory-installed roll cage.\n\nProduction of the first generation 997 GT3 RS ended in 2009. An estimated 413 units were delivered to the US and the worldwide production run is estimated to be under 2,000 vehicles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gt3rsregistry.com/docs/HowMany.htm|title=GT3 RS Registry|publisher=GT3 RS Registry|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100404121248/http://www.gt3rsregistry.com/docs/HowMany.htm|archivedate=4 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2009, Porsche announced the second generation of the 997 GT3 RS with an enlarged 3.8-litre engine having a power output of {{convert|450|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}, a modified suspension, dynamic engine mounts, new titanium sport exhaust, and modified lightweight bodywork.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.automoblog.net/2009/08/19/new-porsche-911-gt3-rs/|title=New Porsche 911 GT3 RS|publisher=Automoblog.net|access-date=19 August 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606040140/http://www.automoblog.net/2009/08/19/new-porsche-911-gt3-rs/|archive-date=6 June 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2011, Porsche announced the third generation of the 997 GT3 RS with an enlarged 4.0-litre engine having a power output of {{convert|500|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}, Porsche designed the GT3 RS 4.0 using lightweight components such as bucket seats, carbon-fibre bonnet and front wings, and poly carbonate plastic rear windows for weight reduction, while using suspension components from the racing version.

Designed as a drivers car, the GTS was more powerful than the S, better handling via a bespoke suspension design, and positioned as a more street friendly alternative to the GT3, Porsche's track-focused 911 variant. The GTS featured race-inspired Center Lock Wheels, unique styling including a Sport Design front bumper, special rear bumper, blackout trim, side skirts borrowed from the GT2 model, brushed stainless steel \"Carrera GTS\" door sills and Alcantara trim. Many GTS' were ordered with the Alcantara delete, instead being built with leather.  The GTS was very rare in that is was a rear wheel drive Wide-Body design (44&nbsp;mm wider than a standard 911), 20&nbsp;mm lower and offered 408 HP (versus 385 HP for the S)  like the similar, limited volume Sport Classic and the Speedster.  Porsche built approximately 2,265 total GTS models for the world market, as well as a handful  designated as 2012 models.  The enthusiastic reception the GTS model received from both the motoring press and consumers, convinced Porsche to make the GTS a staple of the 911 line beginning in 2015, with the \"type 991\" 911 successor.\n\n====Speedster====\n[[File:Porsche 911 Speedster (5828928863).jpg|thumb|right|997 Speedster]]\nIn 2011, Porsche added a new 911 Speedster in a limited series of only 356 units to the 997 lineage, the number of cars produced recalling [[Porsche 356|the iconic car of the 1950s]]. It was the third 911 Speedster produced, the other two being from the [[Porsche 930|930]] and [[Porsche 964|964]] generations. The Speedster was powered by the same engine of the Carrera GTS which is rated at {{convert|414|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. It accelerated from 0 to {{convert|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}} in 4.2 seconds and attained a top speed of around {{convert|190|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}}. Only two colours were offered, Pure Blue (which was developed specifically for the Speedster) and Carrara White. (Paint To Sample versions were produced in very limited numbers and upon special request from \"loyal customers\".)\n\nThe Speedster featured a windscreen 70mm shorter than the standard 997 cabriolet while maintaining the same rake angle.\n\n===991 Series (2012 \u2013 2019)===\n{{Main|Porsche 991}}\n\n[[File:2013 Porsche 911 Carrera 4S (991) (9626546987).jpg|thumb|991 Carrera S]]\nThe [[Porsche 991|991]] introduced in 2012 is an entirely new platform, only the third since [[Porsche 911 classic|the original 911]].

The Carrera S features a 3.8-litre engine rated at {{cvt|406|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. A Power Kit (option X51) is available for the Carrera S, increasing power output to {{cvt|436|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. The new 991's overall length grows by {{cvt|2.2|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}} and wheelbase grows by {{cvt|3.9|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}} (now 96.5 in.) Overhangs are trimmed and the rear axle moves rearward at roughly {{cvt|3|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}} towards the engine (made possible by new 3-shaft transmissions whose output flanges are moved closer to the engine). There is a wider front track ({{cvt|2|in|mm|abbr=on|order=flip}} wider for the Carrera S). The design team for the 991 was headed by Michael Mauer.\n\nAt the front, the new 991 has wide-set headlights that are more three-dimensional. The front fender peaks are a bit more prominent, and wedgy directionals now appear to float above the intakes for the twin coolant radiators. The stretched rear 3/4 view has changed the most, with a slightly more voluminous form and thin taillights capped with the protruding lip of the bodywork. The biggest and main change in the interior is the center console, inspired by the [[Porsche Carrera GT|Carrera GT]] and adopted by the [[Porsche Panamera|Panamera]].\n\nThe 991 is the first 911 to use a predominantly [[aluminium]] construction. This means that even though the car is larger than the outgoing model, it is still up to {{convert|50|kg|lb}} lighter. The reduced weight and increased power means that both the Carrera and Carrera S are appreciably faster than the outgoing models. The 0\u201397&nbsp;km/h (60&nbsp;mph) acceleration time for the manual transmission cars are 4.6 seconds for the Carrera and 4.3 seconds for the Carrera S. When equipped with the PDK transmission, the two 991 models can accelerate from 0\u201397&nbsp;km/h in 4.4 seconds and 4.1 seconds. With the optional sports chrono package, available for the cars with the PDK transmission, the 991 Carrera can accelerate from 0\u201397&nbsp;km/h in as little as 4.2 seconds<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.porsche.com/usa/models/911/911-carrera/featuresandspecs/ |title=Technical Specs - 911 Carrera - All 911 Models |publisher=Porsche.com |accessdate=2012-08-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213191654/http://www.porsche.com/usa/models/911/911-carrera/featuresandspecs/ |archive-date=13 February 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and the Carrera S can do the same in 3.9 seconds.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.porsche.com/usa/models/911/911-carrera-s/featuresandspecs/ |title=Technical Specs - 911 Carrera S - All 911 Models |publisher=Porsche.com |accessdate=2012-08-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213192340/http://www.porsche.com/usa/models/911/911-carrera-s/featuresandspecs/ |archive-date=13 February 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nApart from the reworked PDK transmission, the new 991 is also equipped with an industry-first 7-speed manual transmission. On vehicles produced in late 2012 (2013 model year) Rev Matching is available on the 7 speed manual transmission when equipped with the Sport Chrono package. Rev-Matching is a new feature with the manual transmission that blips the throttle during downshifts (if in Sport Plus mode). Also, the 7th gear cannot be engaged unless the car is already in 5th or 6th gear.\n\nOne of Porsche's primary objectives with the new model was to improve fuel economy as well as increase performance. In order to meet these objectives, Porsche introduced a number of new technologies in the 911. One of the most controversial of these is the introduction of electromechanical power steering instead of the previous hydraulic steering. This steering helps reduce fuel consumption, but some enthusiasts feel that the precise steering feedback for which the 911 is famous is reduced with the new system.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} The cars also feature an engine stop/start system which turns the engine off at red lights, as well as a coasting system which allows the engine to idle while maintaining speed on downhill gradients on highways. This allows for up to 16% reduction in fuel consumption and emissions over the outgoing models.\n\nThe new cars also have a number of technologies aimed at improving handling. The cars include a torque vectoring system (standard on the Carrera S and optional on the Carrera) which brakes the inner wheel of the car when going into turns. This helps the car to turn in quicker and with more precision. The cars also feature hydraulic engine mounts (which help reduce the inertia of the engine when going into turns) as part of the optional sports chrono package. Active suspension management is standard on the Carrera S and optional on the Carrera. This helps improve ride quality on straights, while stiffening the suspension during aggressive driving. The new 991 is also equipped with a new feature called Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control (PDCC). Porsche claims that this new feature alone has shaved 4 seconds off the standard car's lap time around the N\u00fcrburgring. PDCC helps the car corner flat and is said to improve high-speed directional stability and outright lateral body control, but according to several reviews, the car is more prone to understeer when equipped with this new technology.\n\nIn January 2013, Porsche introduced the all-wheel-drive variants of the Carrera models. The '4' and '4S' models are distinguishable by wider tyres, marginally wider rear body-work and a red-reflector strip that sits in between the tail-lights. In terms of technology, the 4 and 4S models are equipped with an all-new variable all-wheel-drive system that sends power to the front wheels only when needed, giving the driver a sense of being in a rear-wheel-drive 911.\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:FoS20162016 0624 132727AA (27886350045).jpg|991 Turbo S\n</gallery>\n\nIn May 2013, Porsche announced changes to the model year 2014 911 Turbo and Turbo S models, increasing their power to {{cvt|520|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} on the 'Turbo', and {{cvt|560|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} on the 'Turbo S', giving them a 0&ndash;97&nbsp;km/h acceleration time of 3.2 and 2.9 seconds, respectively. A [[Four-wheel steering|rear-wheel steering]] system has also been incorporated on the Turbo models that steers the rear wheels in the opposite direction at low speeds or the same direction at high speeds to improve handling.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.automoblog.net/2013/05/06/turbo-terror-the-new-porsche-911-turbo-announced/ |title=Turbo Terror: New Porsche 911 Turbo Announced |publisher=Automoblog.net |date=6 May 2013 |accessdate=2013-05-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508120143/http://www.automoblog.net/2013/05/06/turbo-terror-the-new-porsche-911-turbo-announced/ |archive-date=8 May 2013 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> During low-speed maneuvers, this has the virtual effect of shortening the wheelbase, while at high speeds, it is virtually extending the wheelbase for higher driving stability and agility.\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Festival automobile international 2015 - Porsche 911 Targa - 003.jpg|The 991 Targa features an all-new electronically operated roof mechanism which allows it to have the original Targa design\n</gallery>\n\nIn January 2014, Porsche introduced the new model year 2015 Targa 4 and Targa 4S models.

Extensive changes were made to the engine allowing a 9,000 rpm redline from the 4.0 litre flat-six engine. Porsche's focus was on reducing internal friction to improve throttle response. Compared to the 991.1, the rear spoiler is higher and located further back to be more effective. There is a new front spoiler and changes to the rear suspension. The 991.2 GT3 brought back the choice between a manual transmission or PDK dual clutch transmission. A touring version was also introduced which comes standard with the comfort package and the manual transmission along with the deletion of the fixed rear wing and employing an electronically operated rear wing instead.\n\n====911 GT3 RS====\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Geneva International Motor Show 2018, Le Grand-Saconnex (1X7A0083).jpg|991 GT3 RS\n</gallery>\nPorsche launched the ''Renn Sport'' version of the 911 GT3 at the [[Geneva Motor Show#2015|Geneva Motor Show]] in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.topspeed.com/cars/porsche/2016-porsche-911-gt3-rs-ar115711.html#main|title=2016 Porsche 911 GT3 RS}}</ref> Compared to the 911 GT3, the front fenders are now equipped with louvers above the wheels and the rear fenders now include Turbo-like intakes, rather than an intake below the rear wing. The roof is made from magnesium. The interior includes full bucket seats (based on the carbon seats of the 918 Spyder), carbon-fibre inserts, lightweight door handles and the Club Sport Package as standard (a bolted-on roll cage behind the front seats, preparation for a battery master switch, and a six-point safety harness for the driver and fire extinguisher with mounting bracket). The 3.8-litre unit found in the previous 997 GT3 is replaced with a 4.0-litre unit that has a power output of {{cvt|500|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and 460&nbsp;Nm (339&nbsp;lbft) of torque. The transmission is PDK only. The car accelerates from 0&ndash;100&nbsp;km/h (62&nbsp;mph) in 3.4 seconds (0.6 seconds quicker than the 997 GT3 RS 4.0) and 0&ndash;200&nbsp;km/h (124&nbsp;mph) in 10.9 seconds. The 991 GT3 RS also comes with functions such as declutching by \"paddle neutral\" \u2014 comparable to pressing the clutch with a conventional manual gearbox \u2013 and a Pit Speed limiter button. As with the 911 GT3, a rear-axle steering and Porsche Torque Vectoring Plus with fully variable rear axle differential lock are available as standard.\n\nIn February 2018, Porsche introduced a facelifted GT3 RS model to continue their updates for the 991 generation of the 911.

The engine in the GT1 is rated at {{convert|608|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} ({{cvt|544|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} for the road version) and accelerated from 0\u201397&nbsp;km/h in 3.3 seconds.

The car is not considered to be a real 911{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}, as it is derived from the 962 with the 993 and later the 996 911's front section.

Despite Ronaldinho's initial success with the club, the season was marred by controversy with Paris Saint-Germain manager [[Luis Fern\u00e1ndez]], claiming that the Brazilian was too focused on the Parisian [[nightlife]] rather than football, and complained that his holidays in Brazil never ended at the scheduled times.<ref name=\"worldsoccerjan2005\" />\n\n====2002\u201303 season====\nDespite repeated rifts with Fern\u00e1ndez, Ronaldinho returned to the team for the [[2002\u201303 Ligue 1|2002\u201303 season]], with the player switching to the number 10 shirt. Though his performances in his second season with the club were underwhelming compared to his first, Ronaldinho performed admirably with the club. On 26 October 2002, he scored two goals in PSG's 3\u20131 victory over ''[[Le Classique|Classique]]'' rivals [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]]. The first goal was a [[Direct free kick|free kick]], which curled past numerous Marseille players in the 18-yard box before sailing past [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] [[Vedran Runje]]. In the return match, he again scored in PSG's 3\u20130 victory at the [[Stade V\u00e9lodrome]], running half the length of the field before flicking the ball over the goalkeeper.<ref>[http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/news/newsid=57803.html \"France round-up: PSG humble Marseille\"].

After scoring his first goal in the 22nd minute, Ronaldinho capped the game in the 81st minute, accurately chipping the ball at the 18-yard box over the head of goalkeeper [[Ulrich Ram\u00e9]], despite Ram\u00e9 being in a favorable position. For his performance, Ronaldinho was given a [[standing ovation]] by the Parisian supporters. Unfortunately for the club, however, Ronaldinho and the team failed to capture the form that got them to the final as they bowed out 2\u20131 to Auxerre due to a last minute goal from [[Jean-Alain Boumsong]]. Despite Ronaldinho's performances, the club finished in a disappointing 11th-placed position.

The Italian expedition was intended to exploit mobility and speed but was hampered by the Somali terrain, rainy weather and British resistance.\n\nAt the [[Battle of Tug Argan]] (11\u201315 August) Italian attacks had the advantage of artillery and the outnumbered British, Commonwealth and Imperial forces were gradually worn down and slowly outflanked until the remaining fortified hilltops were made vulnerable to being captured piecemeal. After the failure of a counter-attack towards the Mirgo Pass, the local commander, Major-General [[Alfred Reade Godwin-Austen|Reade Godwin-Austen]] had too few men to retrieve the situation and to keep open an escape route and was given permission to retreat towards Berbera.\n\nThe British fought a rearguard action at Barkasan on 17 August and then retreated after dark but the improvised evacuation went better than expected and the second blocking position at Nasiyeh was also abandoned. The Italian advance was slowed by roads being swamped by the rains and the airstrip near Berbera being found to be garrisoned, making a ''coup de main'' impractical. The British defeat was controversial and caused a deterioration in relations between General [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]], the theatre commander, his subordinates and the Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]].\n\n==Background==\n\n===''Africa Orientale Italiana''===\n\n{{see also|First Italo-Abyssinian War|Second Italo-Abyssinian War}}\n\nOn 9 May 1936, Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] proclaimed the ''[[Italian East Africa|Africa Orientale Italiana]]'' (AOI, Italian East African Empire), formed from Ethiopia and the colonies of [[Italian Eritrea]] and [[Italian Somaliland]]. During the First Italo-Abyssinian War (1895\u20131896), Italy had been thwarted in its colonial ambitions but in the Second Italo-Abyssinian War (3 October 1935 \u2013 5 May 1936) the Italians again invaded Ethiopia from Italian Somaliland and Italian Eritrea.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=2}} On 10 June 1940, Mussolini declared war against Britain and [[French Third Republic|France]], making the Italian forces in Africa a threat to British supply routes along the Mediterranean, the [[Suez Canal]] and the [[Red Sea]].{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=38\u201340}}\n\nEgypt and the Suez Canal were obvious targets and an Italian invasion of [[French Somaliland]] (Djibouti) or British Somaliland was also feasible. Mussolini looked forward to propaganda triumphs in Sudan and British East Africa ([[Kenya]], [[Tanganyika Territory|Tanganyika]] and [[Uganda]]). The Italian General Staff (''Comando Supremo'') had based its strategic calculations on an assumption that there would be no war until 1942, and the [[Regio Esercito (World War II)|''Regio Esercito'']] (Italian Royal Army) and ''[[Regia Aeronautica]]'' (Italian Royal Air Force) were not prepared for a long war or the occupation of large tracts of Africa.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=38\u201340}}\n\n===Middle East Command===\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Egypt]] included [[Sudan]], a [[condominium (international law)|condominium]] between Egypt and Britain, ([[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]]). The British had based [[History of modern Egypt|military forces in Egypt]] since 1882 but these were greatly reduced by the terms of the [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936]], which only allowed British military forces to occupy [[Egypt]] in defence of the Suez Canal.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=6\u20137, 69}} The small British and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] force garrisoned the Suez Canal and the Red Sea route, which was vital to Britain's communications with its Far Eastern and Indian Ocean territories. In mid-1939, Lieutenant-General [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]] was appointed [[General Officer Commanding-in-Chief]] (GOC-in-C) of the new [[Middle East Command]], with responsibility for the [[Mediterranean, Middle East and African theatres of World War II|Mediterranean and Middle East]].{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=19}} Until the [[Franco-Italian Armistice]] (Armistice of Villa Incisa), the Italian 5th Army in [[Tripolitania]] (western Libya) faced the French army in Tunisia and the Italian 10th Army in [[Cyrenaica]] (eastern Libya), confronted the British in Egypt.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=19, 93}}\n\nThe Italian Royal Army had about 215,000 men in Libya and in Egypt, the British had about {{nowrap|36,000 troops,}} with another {{nowrap|27,500 men}} training in Palestine.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=19, 93}} Wavell had about {{nowrap|86,000 troops}} at his disposal for [[Italian Libya|Libya]], [[Kingdom of Iraq|Iraq]], [[Mandatory Syrian Republic|Syria]], [[Pahlavi dynasty|Iran]] and East Africa. Faced with frontiers guarded by about eight men to the mile, Wavell concluded that a defensive strategy was the only feasible policy and intended to mount delaying actions at the main posts and hope for the best. The Foreign Secretary [[Anthony Eden]] convened a conference in Khartoum at the end of October 1940 with Emperor [[Haile Selassie]], the South African General [[Jan Smuts]] (an advisor for the region with [[Winston Churchill]]), Wavell and the senior military commanders in East Africa, including Lieutenant-General Platt and Lieutenant-General Cunningham. An offensive strategy was decided on against Ethiopia, including the use of [[''[[Patriots (Ethiopia)|Arbegnoch]]'' ([[Amharic]] for Patriots), by the conference.{{sfn|Dear|Foot|2005|p=245}} In November, the British and Commonwealth forces gained an intelligence advantage, when the [[Government Communications Headquarters|Government Code and Cypher School]] (GC & CS) at [[Bletchley Park]] broke the high grade cypher of the Royal Army in East Africa. Later that month, the replacement cypher for the ''Regia Aeronautica'' was broken by the Combined Bureau, Middle East (CBME).{{sfn|Dear|Foot|2005|p=247}}\n\n===British Somaliland===\n\n[[File:Somaliland map regions.png|thumb|{{centre|Map of Somaliland showing locations}}]]\nThe British had fought the [[Somaliland Campaign]] (1900\u20131920) against [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]] and the [[Dervish state]], to gain control over the territory. In 1910 the British garrison had been forced to retreat to the coast until the end of the First World War and only after four campaigns did Somali resistance end in 1920, after three weeks of attacks by local troops, a [[King's African Rifles]] (KAR) battalion and the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF). The colony had an area of about {{convert|68000|sqmi|sqkm|0|abbr=on}} with a plain inland from the coast up to {{convert|60|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} deep, ending at a mountain range an average of {{convert|4000|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} high.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=62}}\n\nThere was little scope for agriculture and most of the 320,000 inhabitants lived off livestock herding. [[Berbera]], the biggest town and port, was ringed by desert and scrubland; in the cold season it had a population of about 30,000, falling to around 15,000 in the summer months. The port was a first class anchorage and was the principal [[entrep\u00f4t]] of the colony, despite having no port installations making it unsuitable for an expeditionary force, since ships had to be unloaded by lighter, a method that took ten days to empty a 3,000 [[Gross register tonnage|GRT]] ship. Loading and unloading was impossible during the period from July to August, when the ''Kharif'', a strong and hot wind, blew.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=62}}\n\n===French Somaliland===\n\n{{main|French Somaliland in World War II}}\n\n[[File:Italian East Africa (1938\u20131941).svg|thumb|left|{{centre|Italian East Africa (1938\u20131941), showing Aden and British and French Somaliland}}]]\nBrigadier-General [[Paul Legentilhomme]], in command of British as well as French forces since the outbreak of war obstructed the enforcement of the Armistice of Villa Incisa and continued to co-operate with the British. On 27 July, the terms of the armistice pertaining to French Somaliland were discovered by the British to be the demilitarisation of the colony and free Italian access to the port and the French part of the Addis Ababa railway. When the [[List of governors of French Somaliland|governor]], [[Hubert Deschamps]] said that he would obey instructions from the [[Vichy France|Vichy]] regime, Legentlhomme threatened to use force to prevent him. When the local Italian armistice commission tried to make contact, Legentilhomme assured Cairo that he would play for time but anticipated that the Italians would attack.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=123\u2013125, 128}}\n\nThe 2nd Battalion, the [[Black Watch]] was sent to Aden from Egypt by cruiser, ready to reinforce the French, as Legentilhomme feigned ignorance of the armistice terms. Legentilhomme also denied entry to the new Vichy French governor, General [[Ga\u00ebtan Germain (governor)|Ga\u00ebtan Germain]] (25 July to 7 August). On 19 July, Legentilhomme was opposed in the Governor's Council by the navy and air force commanders and to avoid bloodshed decided that those opposed to Vichy should depart. Legentilhomme had run out of time and left for Aden on 5 August, leaving Germaine to sever relations with the British. Italian apprehension about the possibility of the British using the colony as a bridgehead continued; Germaine was superseded by [[Pierre Nouailhetas]] as governor from 7 August, arriving from France on 2 September.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=128, 167\u2013168}}\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===British defence schemes===\n\n[[File:Geography of Djibouti.png|thumb|{{centre|Geography of Djibouti (French Somaliland)}}]]\nThe Somaliland border was {{convert|750|mi|km|abbr=on}} long and after the Italian occupation of Ethiopia, all but the {{convert|45|mi|km|abbr=on}} border with French Somaliland was contiguous with the new Italian colony. According to the Hornby Report of 1936, the War Office intended to offer no resistance to an invasion. In 1938, the governor, Arthur Lawrence, deplored such a defeatist policy and suggested that the colony could be demilitarised, that the British could leave or that the colony could be defended. According to Chater, a small reinforcement would give the local garrison the means to resist an invasion of the colony for twelve days, sufficient for a relief force to arrive from India but the policy was rejected. In August 1939 the evacuation policy was revised according to two scenarios, that if the French succeeded in defending Djibouti, the British would withdraw towards them and if the French were defeated, the British would retreat into the hills and wait on events. All of the defence arrangements were based on co-operation with Legentilhomme, who would command both forces if war began.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=63\u201364}}\n\nDuring the [[Phoney War]] Wavell became reluctant for British forces to come under French command, unless the withdrawal plan to Djibouti was implemented, which gave Chater more discretion, provided that he still co-operated with the French. Chater wanted to garrison Hargeisa and Burao to fight delaying actions and then retire towards the hill country. The main road into Somaliland from Djibouti was commanded by hills with six passes good enough for wheeled vehicles; both sides agreed that they must be garrisoned to deny them to the Italians and provide a base for debouching when an Allied counter-offensive began. On December 1939, the British had another change of mind, ordering that an invasion must be resisted and that Berbera must be held for as long as possible as a matter of imperial prestige. The commitments entered into with the French, had led to them to go to the trouble and expense of fortifying their colony; because of dissension between Legentilhomme and Paris and within the British and French alliance, the passes at [[Jidhi|Jirreh]] and [[Asha Addo|Dobo]], parallel to the border, were left unfortified, despite having permission to base defences in the British colony.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=75\u201376}}{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=65}}\n\n[[File:Flickr - davehighbury - Royal Artillery Museum Woolwich London 166.jpg|thumb|{{centre|3.7-inch Mountain Gun, Royal Artillery Museum London}}]]\nIn 1940, the 631 members of the [[Somaliland Camel Corps]] (SCC) were based in five places in the colony and a small party of police worked at Berbera. The SCC had 29 motor vehicles, 122 horses and 244 camels but no heavy weapons, only old Belgian {{convert|.475|in|mm|abbr=on}} calibre, single-shot rifles, with 1.4 million rounds of dubious quality ammunition, machine-guns and anti-tank rifles. In February, the British government planned to send 1,100 reinforcements by mid-May but financial wrangling between the War Office and the Colonial Office delayed the arrival of the first infantry battalion until 15 May and the second until 12 July. The garrison of French Somaliland was asked to block the Jirreh and Dobo passes but the British strategy was to hope that French Somaliland was the more tempting target.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=67}}{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=75\u201376}}\n\n===British preparations===\nAfter the Armistice of Villa Incisa, and the end of Legentilhomme's pro-British prevarication, Brigadier [[Arthur Reginald Chater]] RM, the British military commander, was ordered to plan an evacuation if the colony became untenable.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=167\u2013168}} By August, the garrison consisted of the 1st Battalion [[Northern Rhodesia Regiment]] (1st NRR), the 2nd ([[Nyasaland]]) Battalion KAR, the 1st East African Light Battery (four [[QF 3.7-inch mountain howitzer|3.7-inch mountain guns]]) from Kenya, the 1st Battalion [[2nd Punjab Regiment]] and the 3rd Battalion [[15th Punjab Regiment]] from the [[Colony of Aden]] and the SCC, including 37 officer and NCO reinforcements from the Southern Rhodesia Regiment; on 8 August, the 2nd Battalion, Black Watch arrived. The troops were a motley collection, with different customs and culinary arrangements, no proper base or headquarters, short of artillery, transport and signalling equipment. Aircraft had to fly from Aden, while also busy with convoy patrols and air defence; only two [[QF 3-inch 20 cwt|3-inch]] anti-aircraft guns of the 23rd Battery, Hong Kong and Singapore Brigade RA could be spared from Aden.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=172\u2013173}}\n\nThe British expected that Berbera would be the objective of an Italian invasion; the frontier with Ethiopia was too long to guard and there was no position from whence to contest the approaches to the port through Zeila near French Somaliland, thence east along the coast road or through [[Hargeisa]] or via [[Burao]]. The inland mountains were passable by wheeled and tracked vehicles only on the Hargeisa and Burao roads, Hargeisa being the more direct route through a gap at Tug Argan and the Burao road through a defile known as Sheikh Pass. Once north of the hills, the coastal plain had no feature where a small force could prevent the advance of a larger one. Chater garrisoned Tug Argan with two battalions and the mountain artillery, one battalion to guard the other two approaches and kept one battalion in reserve. When the Black Watch arrived, it went into reserve and the 3/15th Punjab Regiment reinforced Tug Argan. The Camel Corps formed a screen in advance of the main defences to observe and delay an invader, with patrols of [[Somali Police Force|Illalo]] an armed constabulary, usually used as a frontier police force.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=173}}\n\n===Italian plans===\n\n[[File:Italian IMAM Ro.37 reconnaissance aircraft in flight.jpg|thumb|{{centre|IMAM Ro.37 ''Lince'' (Lynx) reconnaissance aircraft}}]]\nThe Italians remained suspicious of French intentions after Legentilhomme was replaced by Germaine, of a British invasion through Djibouti. Despite orders from Rome to be cautious, Aosta wanted to occupy Djibouti to forestall its use by the Allies, with a simultaneous advance on Berbera to counter British interference. Aosta submitted the plan to Mussolini on 18 June and in August received permission for the invasion. While waiting, Aosta and his deputy, General [[Guglielmo Nasi]], completed an appreciation of the likely opposition and the campaign objectives and on 14 July predicted that the main battle would be fought in the Karrim and Jerrato passes; if the defenders stood their ground, the Italian troops would be able to envelop their flanks.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=168, 174}} The Italian invasion force included five colonial brigades, three [[Blackshirt]] battalions and five ''Bande'', half a company of [[M11/39]] medium tanks and a squadron of [[L3/35]] tankettes, several armoured cars, 21 howitzer batteries, pack artillery and air support.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=23}}{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=174}}\n\n[[File:Corriere Della Sera - 17 agosto 1940 - Offensiva in Africa - titolo.JPG|thumb|{{centre|The Italian newspaper ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'' covering the start of the Somaliland offensive}}]]\nLieutenant-General [[Carlo De Simone|Carlo de Simone]], issued instructions on 25 July, as commander of the main force, the Harrar Division with eleven African infantry battalions in three brigades, the three Blackshirt battalions and the tanks and armoured cars.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=75}} The French and British were to be prevented from uniting and receiving reinforcements to attack Harrar by occupying British Somaliland and defeating the garrison.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=75}} Because the hills rose to over {{convert|4500|ft|m|abbr=on}}, parallel to the coast some {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on}} inland, there were three approaches to Berbera for wheeled and tracked vehicles for the Italians to consider.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=174}}\n\nThe direct route with the widest pass was via Hargeisa and the Italian plan was for the western column to seal off French Somaliland and then send light forces eastwards along the coast road.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=174}} The eastern column (Brigadier-General [[Arturo Bertello]]) would move to [[Oodweyne|Odweina]] and Burao in the south, to cover the flank of the central column and be prepared to link up with it if necessary. De Simone, with the central column would establish a base at Hargeisa and Adalek then carry the main weight of the attack through the Mirgo Pass towards Berbera. The western column (Lieutenant-General [[Sisto Bertoldi]]) was to advance towards [[Zeila]] to seal the border with French Somaliland and then move eastwards along the coast road towards Berbera.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=174}}\n\n==Battle==\n\n===3\u201310 August===\n\n[[File:GeneraleGuglielmo Nasi.jpg|thumb|upright=.5|left|{{centre|General Guglielmo Nasi}}]]\nOn 3 August 1940, British air reconnaissance discovered that about 400 Italians had crossed the frontier at Biyad; early on 4 August the Italian central column was seen advancing on Hargeisa and the SCC skirmished with the Italians, slowly retiring, keeping watch and harassing the advance when possible.The Italians advanced in three widely spaced columns, Nasi communicating with de Simone by wireless and liaison aircraft, the central column heading for Tug Argan as the flanking columns attempted to deceive the defenders and exploit opportunities as they presented themselves.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=75\u201377}}{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=174}} Aerial operations began on the opening day, with aircraft 15 RAF squadrons participating.{{sfn|Shores|1996|pp=42\u201354}}{{efn|[[No. 39 Squadron RAF|39]] ([[Bristol Blenheim]]), [[No. 112 Squadron RAF|112]] ([[Gloster Gladiator]]), [[No. 94 Squadron RAF|94]] (Gladiator), [[No. 223 Squadron RAF|223]] ([[Vickers Wellesley]]), [[No. 47 Squadron RAF|47]] (Wellesley, [[Vickers Vildebeest|Vickers Vincent]], [[Gloster Gauntlet]]), [[No. 14 Squadron RAF|14]] (Wellesley), [[No. 203 Squadron RAF|203]], [[No. 84 Squadron RAF|84]], [[No. 45 Squadron RAF|45]], [[No. 11 Squadron RAF|11]] and [[No. 8 Squadron RAF|8 Squadrons]] (Blenheim).

Aosta urged haste but Nasi refused to rush, because the road was deteriorating under the heavy traffic and rain. The Italian advance resumed on 8 August and for two days closed up to the British defences and made preparations to attack. The defenders reported the presence of Italian medium tanks and the captain of {{HMAS|Hobart|D63|6}} donated the ship's [[QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss]] saluting gun, a three-man crew and thirty rounds of ammunition.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=173\u2013175}}{{efn|PO H.

The Indian Army was asked to organise the first echelon of the [[5th Infantry Division (India)|5th Indian Infantry Division]] for an infantry battalion, a field battery and a field company to be disembarked at Berbera. Anti-aircraft guns at Port Said were ordered to the colony but this decision was quietly countermanded two days later. Major-General [[Reade Godwin-Austen]] was appointed to command the enlarged force, with orders to defend the Tug Argan, defeat the Italian invasion and plan secretly to evacuate the defenders if it became necessary. Godwin-Austen reached Berbera on 11 July and took over command that evening; the reinforcements were too late and were diverted to Sudan.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=81}}{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=175}}\n\n===Tug Argan defences===\n\n[[File:Tug Argan Gap.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Photograph of the Tug Argan Gap (1954)}}]]\nFrom 7\u20138 August, the defenders had received reinforcements of the 1/2nd Punjab Regiment and the 2nd Battalion Black Watch; by 10 August, De Simone had closed up on the British positions behind the Tug Argan and prepared the Italian attack. The road from Hargeisa turns north through the Karrim Pass to Tug Argan and then east between the Assa hills to the south, hills and dry riverbeds (tugs) to the north. The pass is a flat stone expanse with occasional thorn bushes, tugs and a few rocky hills about {{convert|2000|to|2500|yd|m|abbr=on}} apart, named Black, Knobbly, Mill and Observation hills by the defenders, with Castle Hill {{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of Mill Hill.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=173}}\n\nThe positions had been fortified with machine-gun posts and a modest amount of barbed wire. The defences were impossible to by-pass and had good observation but with so little artillery little advantage could be gained from it. The gap was too wide for the number of defenders, the hills being far enough apart for an attacker to pass between them; only Castle Hill was behind the other fortified hill tops, providing very little scope for defence in depth. There were several camel tracks through the Mirgo Pass {{convert|8|mi|km|abbr=on}} from Black Hill and the Jerato Pass in the Assa Hills, which gave further opportunities for the Italians to exploit their numerical superiority.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=22}}{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=175\u2013176}}\n\n===Battle of Tug Argan===\n\n{{Main|Battle of Tug Argan}}\n\nThe Australians from ''Hobart'' with their Hotchkiss gun arrived at dawn on 10 August but the gun had to be dismantled for loading, which reduced its rate of fire to once every five minutes, while its 32 HE rounds and 32 solid shot lasted.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=81}} On 11 August, the Italians bombarded then attacked the west end of the Assa Hills at Punjab Ridge with a brigade of infantry, pushed back the defending company of the 3rd Battalion, 15th Punjab Regiment, then repulsed a counter-attack; attacks on Mill and Knobbly hills failed. On 12 August, all of the British positions were attacked simultaneously and by the evening Mill Hill, the least fortified position, had been captured after a determined resistance by troops of the Northern Rhodesian Regiment. Two of the East African Light Battery [[howitzer]]s were lost and the Italians had established themselves in the Assa Hills, dominating the southern side of the gap.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=176}} On 13 August, the defenders of Knobbly Hill defeated another attack but the Italians infiltrated down Mirgo Pass past the defended localities and ambushed a convoy carrying water and ammunition, which managed to fight its way through to Castle Hill. Next day, Castle Hill and Observation Hill were bombed and bombarded by artillery but an attack on Observation Hill failed. Mussolini signalled to Aosta,\n\n{{quote|Pour all available reserves into Somaliland to stimulate the operation. Order the entire Imperial air force to co-operate.|Mussolini{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=176}}}}\n\nA counter-attack towards Mirgo Pass, by two companies of the 2nd KAR, had some success before it was forced back by Italian attacks. The Italians were close to positions from which they could cut off the defenders from their sole line of supply and the Italian advantage in artillery meant that the defended localities could be picked off piecemeal. After four days, the defenders were tiring and there was no better position to retreat to; an attempt to hold Berbara alone would be pointless. On 14 August, Godwin-Austen informed [[Henry Maitland Wilson|Henry Wilson]], the [[General officer commanding|General Officer Commanding-in-Chief]] (GOC-in-C) [[Egypt Command|British Troops in Egypt]] of the situation, concluding that further resistance at Tug Argan would be futile and likely to result in the loss of the force. Wavell had been called to London and arrived on 7 August but Wilson kept him informed of events, signalling his decision to order the evacuation of the colony to London with a few minutes. Wavell told Churchill who said that it could not be helped, then Wavell left to return to Cairo.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=76\u201382}} Withdrawal would result in an estimated 70 percent of the force being saved but if necessary the defenders would fight on. When it was clear that the attack towards Mirgo Pass had failed, sufficient troops were left either to retrieve the situation or cover a withdrawal. Early on 15 August, Godwin-Austen signalled his conclusions to Wilson, who ordered Godwin-Austen to withdraw from the colony.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=176\u2013177}} Godwin-Austin planned a slow retirement to Barkasan, about {{convert|33|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} from Berbera, then to Nasiyeh, {{convert|17|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} from the port. Over three nights, civilians then troops would be embarked, the time taken being determined by the monsoon, which usually made it difficult to reach ships by boat at night and before midday.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=177}}\n\n===Air operations===\n[[File:3inch20cwtAAgunHayesCommonMay1940.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Example of a 3-inch 20 cwt Anti-Aircraft gun (UK, May1940}}]]\nThe British airfields at Berbera and [[Laferug]] had only small arms for defence, two [[QF 3-inch 20 cwt|3-inch anti-aircraft guns]] being reserved for the defence of the port. The landing grounds had been quickly made untenable by {{lang|it|Regia Aeronautica}} bombing, two [[No. 94 Squadron RAF|94 Squadron]] [[Gloster Gladiator]] fighters being destroyed on the ground. Bombers were withdrawn to Aden, which meant a {{convert|400|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} round-trip without fighter escort. It was most difficult to influence the tactical situation but the bombers attacked troops and their transport, bases and Addis Ababa, to try to divert Italian fighters. Blenheim Mk Is of 8, 11 and 39 squadrons and 203 squadron with Blenheim IVF fighters and 223 Squadron from Sudan, which arrived at Aden on 14 August and a flight of 84 Squadron from Iraq with Blenheim Mk Is flew standing patrols over Berbera for thirteen days, which limited the ability of the {{lang|it|Regia Aeronautica}} to interfere with the evacuation.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=178}} Blenheims from 11 Squadron left Aden at {{nowrap|5:35 p.m.}} on 18 August and carried out a high-level bombing attack on Italian vehicles near Laferug but lost a bomber to CR.42s from 410\u00b0 {{lang|it|Squadriglia}}, one crew member surviving. While the Italian fighters were attacking the 11 Squadron aircraft, Wellesley bombers from 223 Squadron took off from [[Perim Island]] to attack the airfield at [[Addis Ababa]] and destroyed Aosta's personal aircraft. One SM.79, a [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.75]] and three Ca.133 aircraft were destroyed according to Italian records and a SM.79 and SM.81 were badly damaged.{{sfn|Shores|1996|p=54}}\n\n===Retreat to Berbera===\n\n[[File:C coy 7th bn KAR.png|thumb|{{centre|[[Kenya]]n troops from the 7th Battalion, [[King's African Rifles]] parading in Mogadishu, 1941}}]]\nAfter a long bombardment, the Italians overran Observation Hill and during the night of 15 August, the NRR retreated from Black, Knobbly and Castle hills. The Black Watch, two companies of the 2nd KAR and elements of 1/2nd Punjab Regiment formed a rearguard at Barkasan on the Berbera road, about {{convert|10|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} behind Tug Argan and other troops moved back to Nasiyeh. The retirement was followed up cautiously by the Italians, who attacked the defenders at Barkasan on 17 August. The Black Watch made several counter-attacks and repulsed the attackers but it was only a matter of time before the defences were outflanked. The evacuation at Berbera went more smoothly than expected and Godwin-Austen was able to withdraw the rearguard at Nasiyeh and once night fell, bring back the rearguard from Barkasan.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=177}}\n\n===Evacuation===\nThe [[Royal Navy]] had built an all-tide jetty and had commenced evacuating civilian and administrative officials and on 16 August, the British started to embark troops.{{sfn|TAC|1942|p=19}} Attacks by the ''Regia Aeronautica'' on the British vessels in the Gulf of Aden and Berbera had begun on 8 August to little effect; {{HMAS|Hobart|1939|6}} was slightly damaged in two attacks and the auxiliary vessel ''Chakdina'' suffered splinter damage.{{sfn|Collins|1964|pp=39\u201340}} On 17 August, the Italian western column at Bulhar, about {{convert|40|mi|km|abbr=on}} west of Berbera, was engaged by the light cruiser {{HMS|Ceres|D59|6}} and halted by gunfire.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=23}} After dark, the rearguard was withdrawn to Berbera with minimal losses and loading was complete by the early hours of 18 August. Before sailing for Aden early on 19 August, ''Hobart'', with the force headquarters aboard, stayed behind to collect stragglers and complete the destruction of buildings, vehicles, fuel and stores. The tug ''Queen'' was the only British ship lost in the operation.{{sfn|Gill|1957|pp=205\u2013206}} The Navy embarked {{nowrap|7,140 people,}} {{nowrap|5,690 of}} them being front-line troops, {{nowrap|1,266 civilians}} and {{nowrap|184 sick;}} Most of the Somalis of the SCC were sent home to wait for the British to return, earlier plans for them to fight a guerrilla war being scrapped.

British Somaliland was annexed to Italian East Africa and Mussolini boasted that Italy had conquered a territory the size of [[England]], British Somaliland, the border outposts of Karora, Gallabat, Kurmak and [[Kassala]] in Sudan and [[Moyale]] and [[Buna, Kenya|Buna]] in Kenya. News of the evacuation came as a shock to British public opinion but Wavell backed Godwin-Austen, saying that he had judged the situation correctly.{{sfn|Mockler|1984|pp=245\u2013249}}{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=179}} The British had to immobilise and abandon 350 vehicles and most of their stores because of the need to ferry everything to the ships offshore.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=87}}\n\nWinston Churchill criticised Wavell for the loss of British Somaliland; because of the few casualties, Churchill thought that the colony had not been vigorously defended and proposed a [[court of enquiry]]. Wavell refused to co-operate and said that Godwin-Austen and Wilson had conducted a textbook withdrawal in the face of superior numbers. Wavell sent a telegram to Churchill which included the passage\n\n{{quote|...a big butcher\u2019s bill was not necessarily evidence of good tactics.|Wavell{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=82\u201383}}}}\n\nChurchill was said by General [[John Dill]], the [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff]] (CIGS), to have been moved to \"greater anger than he had ever seen him in before\"; the incident was the beginning of the end for Wavell.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=82\u201383}} In 2016, Andrew Stewart wrote that given the exiguous nature of the British force in the colony, the defenders had done well to resist for as long as they had. The defence of British Somaliland took place during the [[Battle of Britain]] and that the defeat could not be portrayed in heroic terms. Churchill was wrong to condemn Wavell and his subordinates but as Minister of Defence as well as Prime Minister, he could dictate consequences to the defeated generals. Adolf Hitler called the evacuation of the colony a \"hard blow\" but\n\n{{quote|...all the British had lost was the privilege of maintaining an expensive garrison in their least valuable colony.|Cowie ''War for Britain'' (1941){{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=93}}}}\n\nThe capture of the colony was the greatest success of the Italians in the East African campaign but they had not been able to exploit the opportunities that they had created and delays caused by the terrain, weather and the cancellation of a ''coup de main'' by 300 infantry on the port, enabled the British to get away despite the improvised nature of the embarkation.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=93\u201394}}\n\n===Casualties===\n\nIn 1954, [[I. S. O. Playfair|Ian Playfair]], the British official historian, wrote that the British suffered 260 casualties and estimated Italian losses of 2,052 men. Seven British aircraft were shot down and ten were badly damaged in the fourteen days' fighting.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=178\u2013179}} In 1988, Alberto Rovighi, the Italian official historian, wrote that the Italians suffered 465 men killed, 1,530 wounded and 34 missing, a total of 2,029 men, of which 161 were metropolitan Italians and 1,868 were local Eritrean and Somali Ascari. The British-supporting Somalis suffered about 2,000 casualties during the invasion and occupation; about 1,000 Somalis became casualties fighting on the Italian side.{{sfn|Maravigna|1949|p=453}}{{sfn|Rovighi|1988|p=188}} In 1993, Harold Raugh wrote that 38 of the British casualties had been killed and 222 wounded.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|p=82}} In a 1996 publication, Christopher Shores wrote that the RAF had seven aircraft losses and ten aircraft damaged.{{sfn|Shores|1996|p=54}} In 2007, Andrea Molinari recorded 1,995 Italian casualties and four aircraft destroyed.{{sfn|Molinari|2007|p=117}}\n\n===Subsequent operations===\n{{main|Operation Appearance}}\n\nOn 16 March 1941, the British executed Operation Appearance from [[Aden]]; the two [[Sikh]] battalions of the [[Indian Army]], that had been part of the defence force in August 1940 and a Somali commando detachment, were landed on either side of Berbera from transports escorted by HMS ''Glasgow'', ''Caledon'', ''Kandahar'' and ''Kingston''.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=417}}{{sfn|Rohwer|H\u00fcmmelchen|1992|p=54}} The invasion by the Sikhs was the first successful [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] landing on an occupied beach of the war; few men of the Italian 70th Colonial Brigade offered resistance.

The Italian expedition was intended to exploit mobility and speed but was hampered by the Somali terrain, rainy weather and British resistance.\n\nAt the [[Battle of Tug Argan]] (11\u201315 August) Italian attacks had the advantage of artillery and the outnumbered British, Commonwealth and Imperial forces were gradually worn down and slowly outflanked until the remaining fortified hilltops were made vulnerable to being captured piecemeal. After the failure of a counter-attack towards the Mirgo Pass, the local commander, Major-General [[Alfred Reade Godwin-Austen|Reade Godwin-Austen]] had too few men to retrieve the situation and to keep open an escape route and was given permission to retreat towards Berbera.\n\nThe British fought a rearguard action at Barkasan on 17 August and then retreated after dark but the improvised evacuation went better than expected and the second blocking position at Nasiyeh was also abandoned. The Italian advance was slowed by roads being swamped by the rains and the airstrip near Berbera being found to be garrisoned, making a ''coup de main'' impractical. The British defeat was controversial and caused a deterioration in relations between General [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]], the theatre commander, his subordinates and the Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]].\n\n==Background==\n\n===''Africa Orientale Italiana''===\n\n{{see also|First Italo-Abyssinian War|Second Italo-Abyssinian War}}\n\nOn 9 May 1936, Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] proclaimed the ''[[Italian East Africa|Africa Orientale Italiana]]'' (AOI, Italian East African Empire), formed from Ethiopia and the colonies of [[Italian Eritrea]] and [[Italian Somaliland]]. During the First Italo-Abyssinian War (1895\u20131896), Italy had been thwarted in its colonial ambitions but in the Second Italo-Abyssinian War (3 October 1935 \u2013 5 May 1936) the Italians again invaded Ethiopia from Italian Somaliland and Italian Eritrea.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=2}} On 10 June 1940, Mussolini declared war against Britain and [[French Third Republic|France]], making the Italian forces in Africa a threat to British supply routes along the Mediterranean, the [[Suez Canal]] and the [[Red Sea]].{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=38\u201340}}\n\nEgypt and the Suez Canal were obvious targets and an Italian invasion of [[French Somaliland]] (Djibouti) or British Somaliland was also feasible. Mussolini looked forward to propaganda triumphs in Sudan and British East Africa ([[Kenya]], [[Tanganyika Territory|Tanganyika]] and [[Uganda]]). The Italian General Staff (''Comando Supremo'') had based its strategic calculations on an assumption that there would be no war until 1942, and the [[Regio Esercito (World War II)|''Regio Esercito'']] (Italian Royal Army) and ''[[Regia Aeronautica]]'' (Italian Royal Air Force) were not prepared for a long war or the occupation of large tracts of Africa.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=38\u201340}}\n\n===Middle East Command===\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Egypt]] included [[Sudan]], a [[condominium (international law)|condominium]] between Egypt and Britain, ([[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]]). The British had based [[History of modern Egypt|military forces in Egypt]] since 1882 but these were greatly reduced by the terms of the [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936]], which only allowed British military forces to occupy [[Egypt]] in defence of the Suez Canal.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=6\u20137, 69}} The small British and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] force garrisoned the Suez Canal and the Red Sea route, which was vital to Britain's communications with its Far Eastern and Indian Ocean territories. In mid-1939, Lieutenant-General [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]] was appointed [[General Officer Commanding-in-Chief]] (GOC-in-C) of the new [[Middle East Command]], with responsibility for the [[Mediterranean, Middle East and African theatres of World War II|Mediterranean and Middle East]].{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=19}} Until the [[Franco-Italian Armistice]] (Armistice of Villa Incisa), the Italian 5th Army in [[Tripolitania]] (western Libya) faced the French army in Tunisia and the Italian 10th Army in [[Cyrenaica]] (eastern Libya), confronted the British in Egypt.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=19, 93}}\n\nThe Italian Royal Army had about 215,000 men in Libya and in Egypt, the British had about {{nowrap|36,000 troops,}} with another {{nowrap|27,500 men}} training in Palestine.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=19, 93}} Wavell had about {{nowrap|86,000 troops}} at his disposal for [[Italian Libya|Libya]], [[Kingdom of Iraq|Iraq]], [[Mandatory Syrian Republic|Syria]], [[Pahlavi dynasty|Iran]] and East Africa. Faced with frontiers guarded by about eight men to the mile, Wavell concluded that a defensive strategy was the only feasible policy and intended to mount delaying actions at the main posts and hope for the best. The Foreign Secretary [[Anthony Eden]] convened a conference in Khartoum at the end of October 1940 with Emperor [[Haile Selassie]], the South African General [[Jan Smuts]] (an advisor for the region with [[Winston Churchill]]), Wavell and the senior military commanders in East Africa, including Lieutenant-General Platt and Lieutenant-General Cunningham. An offensive strategy was decided on against Ethiopia, including the use of [[''[[Patriots (Ethiopia)|Arbegnoch]]'' ([[Amharic]] for Patriots), by the conference.{{sfn|Dear|Foot|2005|p=245}} In November, the British and Commonwealth forces gained an intelligence advantage, when the [[Government Communications Headquarters|Government Code and Cypher School]] (GC & CS) at [[Bletchley Park]] broke the high grade cypher of the Royal Army in East Africa. Later that month, the replacement cypher for the ''Regia Aeronautica'' was broken by the Combined Bureau, Middle East (CBME).{{sfn|Dear|Foot|2005|p=247}}\n\n===British Somaliland===\n\n[[File:Somaliland map regions.png|thumb|{{centre|Map of Somaliland showing locations}}]]\nThe British had fought the [[Somaliland Campaign]] (1900\u20131920) against [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]] and the [[Dervish state]], to gain control over the territory. In 1910 the British garrison had been forced to retreat to the coast until the end of the First World War and only after four campaigns did Somali resistance end in 1920, after three weeks of attacks by local troops, a [[King's African Rifles]] (KAR) battalion and the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF). The colony had an area of about {{convert|68000|sqmi|sqkm|0|abbr=on}} with a plain inland from the coast up to {{convert|60|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} deep, ending at a mountain range an average of {{convert|4000|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} high.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=62}}\n\nThere was little scope for agriculture and most of the 320,000 inhabitants lived off livestock herding. [[Berbera]], the biggest town and port, was ringed by desert and scrubland; in the cold season it had a population of about 30,000, falling to around 15,000 in the summer months. The port was a first class anchorage and was the principal [[entrep\u00f4t]] of the colony, despite having no port installations making it unsuitable for an expeditionary force, since ships had to be unloaded by lighter, a method that took ten days to empty a 3,000 [[Gross register tonnage|GRT]] ship. Loading and unloading was impossible during the period from July to August, when the ''Kharif'', a strong and hot wind, blew.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=62}}\n\n===French Somaliland===\n\n{{main|French Somaliland in World War II}}\n\n[[File:Italian East Africa (1938\u20131941).svg|thumb|left|{{centre|Italian East Africa (1938\u20131941), showing Aden and British and French Somaliland}}]]\nBrigadier-General [[Paul Legentilhomme]], in command of British as well as French forces since the outbreak of war obstructed the enforcement of the Armistice of Villa Incisa and continued to co-operate with the British. On 27 July, the terms of the armistice pertaining to French Somaliland were discovered by the British to be the demilitarisation of the colony and free Italian access to the port and the French part of the Addis Ababa railway. When the [[List of governors of French Somaliland|governor]], [[Hubert Deschamps]] said that he would obey instructions from the [[Vichy France|Vichy]] regime, Legentlhomme threatened to use force to prevent him. When the local Italian armistice commission tried to make contact, Legentilhomme assured Cairo that he would play for time but anticipated that the Italians would attack.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=123\u2013125, 128}}\n\nThe 2nd Battalion, the [[Black Watch]] was sent to Aden from Egypt by cruiser, ready to reinforce the French, as Legentilhomme feigned ignorance of the armistice terms. Legentilhomme also denied entry to the new Vichy French governor, General [[Ga\u00ebtan Germain (governor)|Ga\u00ebtan Germain]] (25 July to 7 August). On 19 July, Legentilhomme was opposed in the Governor's Council by the navy and air force commanders and to avoid bloodshed decided that those opposed to Vichy should depart. Legentilhomme had run out of time and left for Aden on 5 August, leaving Germaine to sever relations with the British. Italian apprehension about the possibility of the British using the colony as a bridgehead continued; Germaine was superseded by [[Pierre Nouailhetas]] as governor from 7 August, arriving from France on 2 September.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=128, 167\u2013168}}\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===British defence schemes===\n\n[[File:Geography of Djibouti.png|thumb|{{centre|Geography of Djibouti (French Somaliland)}}]]\nThe Somaliland border was {{convert|750|mi|km|abbr=on}} long and after the Italian occupation of Ethiopia, all but the {{convert|45|mi|km|abbr=on}} border with French Somaliland was contiguous with the new Italian colony. According to the Hornby Report of 1936, the War Office intended to offer no resistance to an invasion. In 1938, the governor, Arthur Lawrence, deplored such a defeatist policy and suggested that the colony could be demilitarised, that the British could leave or that the colony could be defended. According to Chater, a small reinforcement would give the local garrison the means to resist an invasion of the colony for twelve days, sufficient for a relief force to arrive from India but the policy was rejected. In August 1939 the evacuation policy was revised according to two scenarios, that if the French succeeded in defending Djibouti, the British would withdraw towards them and if the French were defeated, the British would retreat into the hills and wait on events. All of the defence arrangements were based on co-operation with Legentilhomme, who would command both forces if war began.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=63\u201364}}\n\nDuring the [[Phoney War]] Wavell became reluctant for British forces to come under French command, unless the withdrawal plan to Djibouti was implemented, which gave Chater more discretion, provided that he still co-operated with the French. Chater wanted to garrison Hargeisa and Burao to fight delaying actions and then retire towards the hill country. The main road into Somaliland from Djibouti was commanded by hills with six passes good enough for wheeled vehicles; both sides agreed that they must be garrisoned to deny them to the Italians and provide a base for debouching when an Allied counter-offensive began. On December 1939, the British had another change of mind, ordering that an invasion must be resisted and that Berbera must be held for as long as possible as a matter of imperial prestige. The commitments entered into with the French, had led to them to go to the trouble and expense of fortifying their colony; because of dissension between Legentilhomme and Paris and within the British and French alliance, the passes at [[Jidhi|Jirreh]] and [[Asha Addo|Dobo]], parallel to the border, were left unfortified, despite having permission to base defences in the British colony.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=75\u201376}}{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=65}}\n\n[[File:Flickr - davehighbury - Royal Artillery Museum Woolwich London 166.jpg|thumb|{{centre|3.7-inch Mountain Gun, Royal Artillery Museum London}}]]\nIn 1940, the 631 members of the [[Somaliland Camel Corps]] (SCC) were based in five places in the colony and a small party of police worked at Berbera. The SCC had 29 motor vehicles, 122 horses and 244 camels but no heavy weapons, only old Belgian {{convert|.475|in|mm|abbr=on}} calibre, single-shot rifles, with 1.4 million rounds of dubious quality ammunition, machine-guns and anti-tank rifles. In February, the British government planned to send 1,100 reinforcements by mid-May but financial wrangling between the War Office and the Colonial Office delayed the arrival of the first infantry battalion until 15 May and the second until 12 July. The garrison of French Somaliland was asked to block the Jirreh and Dobo passes but the British strategy was to hope that French Somaliland was the more tempting target.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=67}}{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=75\u201376}}\n\n===British preparations===\nAfter the Armistice of Villa Incisa, and the end of Legentilhomme's pro-British prevarication, Brigadier [[Arthur Reginald Chater]] RM, the British military commander, was ordered to plan an evacuation if the colony became untenable.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=167\u2013168}} By August, the garrison consisted of the 1st Battalion [[Northern Rhodesia Regiment]] (1st NRR), the 2nd ([[Nyasaland]]) Battalion KAR, the 1st East African Light Battery (four [[QF 3.7-inch mountain howitzer|3.7-inch mountain guns]]) from Kenya, the 1st Battalion [[2nd Punjab Regiment]] and the 3rd Battalion [[15th Punjab Regiment]] from the [[Colony of Aden]] and the SCC, including 37 officer and NCO reinforcements from the Southern Rhodesia Regiment; on 8 August, the 2nd Battalion, Black Watch arrived. The troops were a motley collection, with different customs and culinary arrangements, no proper base or headquarters, short of artillery, transport and signalling equipment. Aircraft had to fly from Aden, while also busy with convoy patrols and air defence; only two [[QF 3-inch 20 cwt|3-inch]] anti-aircraft guns of the 23rd Battery, Hong Kong and Singapore Brigade RA could be spared from Aden.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=172\u2013173}}\n\nThe British expected that Berbera would be the objective of an Italian invasion; the frontier with Ethiopia was too long to guard and there was no position from whence to contest the approaches to the port through Zeila near French Somaliland, thence east along the coast road or through [[Hargeisa]] or via [[Burao]]. The inland mountains were passable by wheeled and tracked vehicles only on the Hargeisa and Burao roads, Hargeisa being the more direct route through a gap at Tug Argan and the Burao road through a defile known as Sheikh Pass. Once north of the hills, the coastal plain had no feature where a small force could prevent the advance of a larger one. Chater garrisoned Tug Argan with two battalions and the mountain artillery, one battalion to guard the other two approaches and kept one battalion in reserve. When the Black Watch arrived, it went into reserve and the 3/15th Punjab Regiment reinforced Tug Argan. The Camel Corps formed a screen in advance of the main defences to observe and delay an invader, with patrols of [[Somali Police Force|Illalo]] an armed constabulary, usually used as a frontier police force.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=173}}\n\n===Italian plans===\n\n[[File:Italian IMAM Ro.37 reconnaissance aircraft in flight.jpg|thumb|{{centre|IMAM Ro.37 ''Lince'' (Lynx) reconnaissance aircraft}}]]\nThe Italians remained suspicious of French intentions after Legentilhomme was replaced by Germaine, of a British invasion through Djibouti. Despite orders from Rome to be cautious, Aosta wanted to occupy Djibouti to forestall its use by the Allies, with a simultaneous advance on Berbera to counter British interference. Aosta submitted the plan to Mussolini on 18 June and in August received permission for the invasion. While waiting, Aosta and his deputy, General [[Guglielmo Nasi]], completed an appreciation of the likely opposition and the campaign objectives and on 14 July predicted that the main battle would be fought in the Karrim and Jerrato passes; if the defenders stood their ground, the Italian troops would be able to envelop their flanks.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=168, 174}} The Italian invasion force included five colonial brigades, three [[Blackshirt]] battalions and five ''Bande'', half a company of [[M11/39]] medium tanks and a squadron of [[L3/35]] tankettes, several armoured cars, 21 howitzer batteries, pack artillery and air support.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=23}}{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=174}}\n\n[[File:Corriere Della Sera - 17 agosto 1940 - Offensiva in Africa - titolo.JPG|thumb|{{centre|The Italian newspaper ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'' covering the start of the Somaliland offensive}}]]\nLieutenant-General [[Carlo De Simone|Carlo de Simone]], issued instructions on 25 July, as commander of the main force, the Harrar Division with eleven African infantry battalions in three brigades, the three Blackshirt battalions and the tanks and armoured cars.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=75}} The French and British were to be prevented from uniting and receiving reinforcements to attack Harrar by occupying British Somaliland and defeating the garrison.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=75}} Because the hills rose to over {{convert|4500|ft|m|abbr=on}}, parallel to the coast some {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on}} inland, there were three approaches to Berbera for wheeled and tracked vehicles for the Italians to consider.

The Indian Army was asked to organise the first echelon of the [[5th Infantry Division (India)|5th Indian Infantry Division]] for an infantry battalion, a field battery and a field company to be disembarked at Berbera. Anti-aircraft guns at Port Said were ordered to the colony but this decision was quietly countermanded two days later. Major-General [[Reade Godwin-Austen]] was appointed to command the enlarged force, with orders to defend the Tug Argan, defeat the Italian invasion and plan secretly to evacuate the defenders if it became necessary. Godwin-Austen reached Berbera on 11 July and took over command that evening; the reinforcements were too late and were diverted to Sudan.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=81}}{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=175}}\n\n===Tug Argan defences===\n\n[[File:Tug Argan Gap.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Photograph of the Tug Argan Gap (1954)}}]]\nFrom 7\u20138 August, the defenders had received reinforcements of the 1/2nd Punjab Regiment and the 2nd Battalion Black Watch; by 10 August, De Simone had closed up on the British positions behind the Tug Argan and prepared the Italian attack. The road from Hargeisa turns north through the Karrim Pass to Tug Argan and then east between the Assa hills to the south, hills and dry riverbeds (tugs) to the north. The pass is a flat stone expanse with occasional thorn bushes, tugs and a few rocky hills about {{convert|2000|to|2500|yd|m|abbr=on}} apart, named Black, Knobbly, Mill and Observation hills by the defenders, with Castle Hill {{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on}} east of Mill Hill.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=173}}\n\nThe positions had been fortified with machine-gun posts and a modest amount of barbed wire. The defences were impossible to by-pass and had good observation but with so little artillery little advantage could be gained from it. The gap was too wide for the number of defenders, the hills being far enough apart for an attacker to pass between them; only Castle Hill was behind the other fortified hill tops, providing very little scope for defence in depth. There were several camel tracks through the Mirgo Pass {{convert|8|mi|km|abbr=on}} from Black Hill and the Jerato Pass in the Assa Hills, which gave further opportunities for the Italians to exploit their numerical superiority.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=22}}{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=175\u2013176}}\n\n===Battle of Tug Argan===\n\n{{Main|Battle of Tug Argan}}\n\nThe Australians from ''Hobart'' with their Hotchkiss gun arrived at dawn on 10 August but the gun had to be dismantled for loading, which reduced its rate of fire to once every five minutes, while its 32 HE rounds and 32 solid shot lasted.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=81}} On 11 August, the Italians bombarded then attacked the west end of the Assa Hills at Punjab Ridge with a brigade of infantry, pushed back the defending company of the 3rd Battalion, 15th Punjab Regiment, then repulsed a counter-attack; attacks on Mill and Knobbly hills failed. On 12 August, all of the British positions were attacked simultaneously and by the evening Mill Hill, the least fortified position, had been captured after a determined resistance by troops of the Northern Rhodesian Regiment. Two of the East African Light Battery [[howitzer]]s were lost and the Italians had established themselves in the Assa Hills, dominating the southern side of the gap.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=176}} On 13 August, the defenders of Knobbly Hill defeated another attack but the Italians infiltrated down Mirgo Pass past the defended localities and ambushed a convoy carrying water and ammunition, which managed to fight its way through to Castle Hill. Next day, Castle Hill and Observation Hill were bombed and bombarded by artillery but an attack on Observation Hill failed. Mussolini signalled to Aosta,\n\n{{quote|Pour all available reserves into Somaliland to stimulate the operation. Order the entire Imperial air force to co-operate.|Mussolini{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=176}}}}\n\nA counter-attack towards Mirgo Pass, by two companies of the 2nd KAR, had some success before it was forced back by Italian attacks. The Italians were close to positions from which they could cut off the defenders from their sole line of supply and the Italian advantage in artillery meant that the defended localities could be picked off piecemeal. After four days, the defenders were tiring and there was no better position to retreat to; an attempt to hold Berbara alone would be pointless. On 14 August, Godwin-Austen informed [[Henry Maitland Wilson|Henry Wilson]], the [[General officer commanding|General Officer Commanding-in-Chief]] (GOC-in-C) [[Egypt Command|British Troops in Egypt]] of the situation, concluding that further resistance at Tug Argan would be futile and likely to result in the loss of the force. Wavell had been called to London and arrived on 7 August but Wilson kept him informed of events, signalling his decision to order the evacuation of the colony to London with a few minutes. Wavell told Churchill who said that it could not be helped, then Wavell left to return to Cairo.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=76\u201382}} Withdrawal would result in an estimated 70 percent of the force being saved but if necessary the defenders would fight on. When it was clear that the attack towards Mirgo Pass had failed, sufficient troops were left either to retrieve the situation or cover a withdrawal. Early on 15 August, Godwin-Austen signalled his conclusions to Wilson, who ordered Godwin-Austen to withdraw from the colony.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=176\u2013177}} Godwin-Austin planned a slow retirement to Barkasan, about {{convert|33|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} from Berbera, then to Nasiyeh, {{convert|17|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} from the port. Over three nights, civilians then troops would be embarked, the time taken being determined by the monsoon, which usually made it difficult to reach ships by boat at night and before midday.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=177}}\n\n===Air operations===\n[[File:3inch20cwtAAgunHayesCommonMay1940.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Example of a 3-inch 20 cwt Anti-Aircraft gun (UK, May1940}}]]\nThe British airfields at Berbera and [[Laferug]] had only small arms for defence, two [[QF 3-inch 20 cwt|3-inch anti-aircraft guns]] being reserved for the defence of the port.

Bombers were withdrawn to Aden, which meant a {{convert|400|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} round-trip without fighter escort. It was most difficult to influence the tactical situation but the bombers attacked troops and their transport, bases and Addis Ababa, to try to divert Italian fighters. Blenheim Mk Is of 8, 11 and 39 squadrons and 203 squadron with Blenheim IVF fighters and 223 Squadron from Sudan, which arrived at Aden on 14 August and a flight of 84 Squadron from Iraq with Blenheim Mk Is flew standing patrols over Berbera for thirteen days, which limited the ability of the {{lang|it|Regia Aeronautica}} to interfere with the evacuation.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=178}} Blenheims from 11 Squadron left Aden at {{nowrap|5:35 p.m.}} on 18 August and carried out a high-level bombing attack on Italian vehicles near Laferug but lost a bomber to CR.42s from 410\u00b0 {{lang|it|Squadriglia}}, one crew member surviving. While the Italian fighters were attacking the 11 Squadron aircraft, Wellesley bombers from 223 Squadron took off from [[Perim Island]] to attack the airfield at [[Addis Ababa]] and destroyed Aosta's personal aircraft. One SM.79, a [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.75]] and three Ca.133 aircraft were destroyed according to Italian records and a SM.79 and SM.81 were badly damaged.{{sfn|Shores|1996|p=54}}\n\n===Retreat to Berbera===\n\n[[File:C coy 7th bn KAR.png|thumb|{{centre|[[Kenya]]n troops from the 7th Battalion, [[King's African Rifles]] parading in Mogadishu, 1941}}]]\nAfter a long bombardment, the Italians overran Observation Hill and during the night of 15 August, the NRR retreated from Black, Knobbly and Castle hills. The Black Watch, two companies of the 2nd KAR and elements of 1/2nd Punjab Regiment formed a rearguard at Barkasan on the Berbera road, about {{convert|10|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} behind Tug Argan and other troops moved back to Nasiyeh. The retirement was followed up cautiously by the Italians, who attacked the defenders at Barkasan on 17 August. The Black Watch made several counter-attacks and repulsed the attackers but it was only a matter of time before the defences were outflanked. The evacuation at Berbera went more smoothly than expected and Godwin-Austen was able to withdraw the rearguard at Nasiyeh and once night fell, bring back the rearguard from Barkasan.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=177}}\n\n===Evacuation===\nThe [[Royal Navy]] had built an all-tide jetty and had commenced evacuating civilian and administrative officials and on 16 August, the British started to embark troops.{{sfn|TAC|1942|p=19}} Attacks by the ''Regia Aeronautica'' on the British vessels in the Gulf of Aden and Berbera had begun on 8 August to little effect; {{HMAS|Hobart|1939|6}} was slightly damaged in two attacks and the auxiliary vessel ''Chakdina'' suffered splinter damage.{{sfn|Collins|1964|pp=39\u201340}} On 17 August, the Italian western column at Bulhar, about {{convert|40|mi|km|abbr=on}} west of Berbera, was engaged by the light cruiser {{HMS|Ceres|D59|6}} and halted by gunfire.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=23}} After dark, the rearguard was withdrawn to Berbera with minimal losses and loading was complete by the early hours of 18 August. Before sailing for Aden early on 19 August, ''Hobart'', with the force headquarters aboard, stayed behind to collect stragglers and complete the destruction of buildings, vehicles, fuel and stores. The tug ''Queen'' was the only British ship lost in the operation.{{sfn|Gill|1957|pp=205\u2013206}} The Navy embarked {{nowrap|7,140 people,}} {{nowrap|5,690 of}} them being front-line troops, {{nowrap|1,266 civilians}} and {{nowrap|184 sick;}} Most of the Somalis of the SCC were sent home to wait for the British to return, earlier plans for them to fight a guerrilla war being scrapped.

British Somaliland was annexed to Italian East Africa and Mussolini boasted that Italy had conquered a territory the size of [[England]], British Somaliland, the border outposts of Karora, Gallabat, Kurmak and [[Kassala]] in Sudan and [[Moyale]] and [[Buna, Kenya|Buna]] in Kenya.

Wavell refused to co-operate and said that Godwin-Austen and Wilson had conducted a textbook withdrawal in the face of superior numbers. Wavell sent a telegram to Churchill which included the passage\n\n{{quote|...a big butcher\u2019s bill was not necessarily evidence of good tactics.|Wavell{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=82\u201383}}}}\n\nChurchill was said by General [[John Dill]], the [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff]] (CIGS), to have been moved to \"greater anger than he had ever seen him in before\"; the incident was the beginning of the end for Wavell.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=82\u201383}} In 2016, Andrew Stewart wrote that given the exiguous nature of the British force in the colony, the defenders had done well to resist for as long as they had. The defence of British Somaliland took place during the [[Battle of Britain]] and that the defeat could not be portrayed in heroic terms. Churchill was wrong to condemn Wavell and his subordinates but as Minister of Defence as well as Prime Minister, he could dictate consequences to the defeated generals.

Widely considered as one of the most influential bands in the genre and important in the transition of death metal from its [[thrash metal]] roots, they were one of the first bands to incorporate guttural vocals, up-tempo [[blast beat]]s, multiple tempo changes and dark atmosphere. They have been described as one of \"the most influential and emulated bands in death metal\", alongside [[Obituary (band)|Obituary]], [[Death (metal band)|Death]], [[Cynic (band)|Cynic]], [[Autopsy (band)|Autopsy]] and [[Deicide (band)|Deicide]], and have been cited as an influence by many later bands.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AwJJR5vvlIsC&lpg=PA63&dq=death%20metal%20heyday%2090s&pg=PA18#v=snippet&q=morbid%20angel&f=false|title=Death Metal Music: The Passion and Politics of a Subculture|last=Purcell|first=Natalie J.|date=May 5, 2003|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786484065|language=en}}</ref> They were also the first death metal band to experience mainstream success in connection with being signed to [[Giant Records (Warner)|Giant Records]] in 1992, heavy rotation of their music videos on MTV, and having the music video for the song \"God of Emptiness\" shown on an episode of ''[[Beavis and Butt-head]]''.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite news|url=http://teamrock.com/feature/2014-10-22/20-years-of-morbid-angel-s-covenant|title=20 Years Of Morbid Angel's Covenant|date=October 22, 2014|newspaper=TeamRock|language=en-GB|access-date=January 26, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\":02\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1388181/covenant-turns-20/franchises/the-anniversary/|title=Covenant Turns 20|date=June 20, 2013|newspaper=Stereogum|access-date=January 26, 2017}}</ref> Their first four albums \u2013 ''[[Altars of Madness]]'' (1989), ''[[Blessed Are the Sick]]'' (1991), ''[[Covenant (Morbid Angel album)|Covenant]]'' (1993) and ''[[Domination (Morbid Angel album)|Domination]]'' (1995) \u2013 are considered classics in the genre.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/morbid-angel-domination-reissued-on-limited-edition-digipak-cd-with-free-poster/|title=MORBID ANGEL: 'Domination' Reissued On Limited-Edition Digipak CD With Free Poster|date=August 22, 2011|newspaper=BLABBERMOUTH.NET|language=en-US|access-date=January 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\nBritish music magazine ''[[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]]'' ranked ''Altars of Madness'' first in its list \"Top 40 greatest death metal albums\".

In the early stages of their career the band developed a reputation for \"gruesome stage antics.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> They recorded their debut album, ''[[Abominations of Desolation]]'', in 1986, but the band was unsatisfied with the final product and it remained unreleased until 1991, printing 10,000 copies. In 1986, David Vincent joined the band, replacing Michael Manson and Sterling von Scarborough as vocalist and bassist respectively. Fellow [[Terrorizer (band)|Terrorizer]] member, drummer [[Pete Sandoval]], soon followed. The band made their debut in 1987 on the [[New Renaissance Records]] record label.\n\nTheir first studio album, ''[[Altars of Madness]]'', was released in 1989, and is regarded by many as one of the most important death metal albums of all time.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.terrorizer.com/news/features-2/the-terrorizer-friday-death-metal-top-15/|title=The Terrorizer Friday Death Metal Top 15 - Terrorizer|date=August 24, 2012|newspaper=Terrorizer|language=en-GB|access-date=January 27, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/morbid-angel-altars-of-madness-best-debut-metal-albums/|title=No. 4: Morbid Angel, 'Altars of Madness' \u2013 Best Debut Metal Albums|website=Loudwire|language=en-US|access-date=January 27, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.treblezine.com/10-essential-death-metal-albums/|title=10 Essential Death Metal Albums|website=www.treblezine.com|language=en-US|access-date=January 27, 2017}}</ref> Music journalist Jason Birchmeier writes that:<blockquote>Few albums struck a chord within the ears and minds of the late-'80s underground metal scene like Morbid Angel's ''Altars of Madness'' did at the end of the decade, setting a new precedent for metal bands to reach. With the arguable exception of [[Chuck Schuldiner]]'s [[Death (metal band)|Death]], never before had a heavy metal band carried their lightning-fast guitar riffs and equally spellbinding guitar solos into such horrific territory. [[Venom (band)|Venom]] and [[Slayer]] redefined the extent to which a metal band could align itself with all things evil during the beginning of the decade, but Morbid Angel made these two groups sound like children's music compared to the Florida-based group's assaulting death metal sounds and their blasphemous lyrics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/altars-of-madness-mw0000311214|title=Altars of Madness - Morbid Angel {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=2017-01-27}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nMorbid Angel toured for nearly two years in support of ''Altars of Madness''. The tour started in November 1989 when they opened for [[Napalm Death]] and [[Bolt Thrower]] in the UK and Europe. Most of 1990 and 1991 were spent touring North America, playing with bands such as [[Pantera]], [[Obituary (band)|Obituary]], [[Atheist (band)|Atheist]], [[Death Angel]], [[Forbidden (band)|Forbidden]], [[Sanctuary (band)|Sanctuary]], [[Ripping Corpse]], [[Deicide (band)|Deicide]], [[Sacrifice (band)|Sacrifice]] and [[Wrath (band)|Wrath]]. The ''Altars of Madness'' tour ended in April 1991 with a Brazilian tour, supported by [[Sarc\u00f3fago]], Sextrash and Cambio Negro.<ref name=\"metallipromo\">{{cite web|title=Morbid Angel|url=http://metallipromo.com/morbid.html|publisher=metallipromo.com|accessdate=August 14, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Pantera|url=http://metallipromo.com/pantera.html|publisher=metallipromo.com|accessdate=August 14, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Rise to success (1991\u20131995)===\nIn 1991, Morbid Angel released their second album, ''[[Blessed Are the Sick]]'', which was met with widespread critical acclaim, and is considered by many to be a landmark release in the death metal genre.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/morbid-angel-mn0000928351/biography|title=Morbid Angel {{!}} Biography & History {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=January 27, 2017}}</ref> The album differed from its predecessor, showcasing a more \"sludgy\" side to the band. Morbid Angel toured worldwide in support of ''Blessed Are the Sick'' throughout 1991 and 1992, headlining a European tour with [[Sadus]], [[Cathedral (band)|Cathedral]], [[Godflesh]] and [[Unleashed (band)|Unleashed]], a North American tour (also supported by Unleashed) and then a European tour with [[Entombed (band)|Entombed]] and Unleashed. They also were one of the opening acts (along with [[Kreator]], [[Sepultura]], Headhunter and [[Wolfsbane (band)|Wolfsbane]]) for [[Mot\u00f6rhead]] on the \"Christmas Metal Meetings '91\" tour, and toured Australia for the first time.<ref name=\"metallipromo\" />\n\nFollowing the success of ''[[Altars of Madness]]'' and ''Blessed Are the Sick'', Morbid Angel were signed by [[Irving Azoff]] to [[Giant Records (Warner)|Giant Records]] for one album, with the option of five more.<ref name=\":02\" /> In late 1992, second guitarist Richard Brunelle was kicked out of the band due to alleged substance abuse; instead of replacing him, Morbid Angel moved on as a three-piece.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nOn June 22, 1993 the band released their third full-length album ''[[Covenant (Morbid Angel album)|Covenant]]'', which went on to sell over 150,000 copies in the United States alone. Their record label dedicated promotional resources to the album, and commissioned music videos for the songs \"Rapture\" and \"God of Emptiness\". These music videos were put on heavy rotation by MTV, and the latter also appeared on the television show ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head|Beavis and Butt-head]]''. The success of the album enabled the band to tour with [[Black Sabbath]] and [[Mot\u00f6rhead]] across the United States from February through March 1994, which David Vincent credits with helping the band significantly expand their audience.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-03-04/news/va-29884_1_recent-black-sabbath|title=Hard Rock of Ages :  Metal heroes Black Sabbath are still going strong after more than two decades and drawing a new generation of euphoric, stage-diving fans.|last=APPLEFORD|first=STEVE|date=March 4, 1994|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035|access-date=January 26, 2017}}</ref> Morbid Angel also toured North America with [[Kreator]] and [[Paradise Lost (band)|Paradise Lost]], and Europe with [[Grave (band)|Grave]] and [[Dismember (band)|Dismember]].<ref name=\"metallipromo\" />\n\nThe band released its fourth studio album, ''[[Domination (Morbid Angel album)|Domination]]'', on May 9, 1995, which featured new guitarist [[Erik Rutan]] of [[Ripping Corpse]].

Widely considered as one of the most influential bands in the genre and important in the transition of death metal from its [[thrash metal]] roots, they were one of the first bands to incorporate guttural vocals, up-tempo [[blast beat]]s, multiple tempo changes and dark atmosphere. They have been described as one of \"the most influential and emulated bands in death metal\", alongside [[Obituary (band)|Obituary]], [[Death (metal band)|Death]], [[Cynic (band)|Cynic]], [[Autopsy (band)|Autopsy]] and [[Deicide (band)|Deicide]], and have been cited as an influence by many later bands.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AwJJR5vvlIsC&lpg=PA63&dq=death%20metal%20heyday%2090s&pg=PA18#v=snippet&q=morbid%20angel&f=false|title=Death Metal Music: The Passion and Politics of a Subculture|last=Purcell|first=Natalie J.|date=May 5, 2003|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786484065|language=en}}</ref> They were also the first death metal band to experience mainstream success in connection with being signed to [[Giant Records (Warner)|Giant Records]] in 1992, heavy rotation of their music videos on MTV, and having the music video for the song \"God of Emptiness\" shown on an episode of ''[[Beavis and Butt-head]]''.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite news|url=http://teamrock.com/feature/2014-10-22/20-years-of-morbid-angel-s-covenant|title=20 Years Of Morbid Angel's Covenant|date=October 22, 2014|newspaper=TeamRock|language=en-GB|access-date=January 26, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\":02\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1388181/covenant-turns-20/franchises/the-anniversary/|title=Covenant Turns 20|date=June 20, 2013|newspaper=Stereogum|access-date=January 26, 2017}}</ref> Their first four albums \u2013 ''[[Altars of Madness]]'' (1989), ''[[Blessed Are the Sick]]'' (1991), ''[[Covenant (Morbid Angel album)|Covenant]]'' (1993) and ''[[Domination (Morbid Angel album)|Domination]]'' (1995) \u2013 are considered classics in the genre.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/morbid-angel-domination-reissued-on-limited-edition-digipak-cd-with-free-poster/|title=MORBID ANGEL: 'Domination' Reissued On Limited-Edition Digipak CD With Free Poster|date=August 22, 2011|newspaper=BLABBERMOUTH.NET|language=en-US|access-date=January 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\nBritish music magazine ''[[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]]'' ranked ''Altars of Madness'' first in its list \"Top 40 greatest death metal albums\".

In the early stages of their career the band developed a reputation for \"gruesome stage antics.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> They recorded their debut album, ''[[Abominations of Desolation]]'', in 1986, but the band was unsatisfied with the final product and it remained unreleased until 1991, printing 10,000 copies. In 1986, David Vincent joined the band, replacing Michael Manson and Sterling von Scarborough as vocalist and bassist respectively. Fellow [[Terrorizer (band)|Terrorizer]] member, drummer [[Pete Sandoval]], soon followed. The band made their debut in 1987 on the [[New Renaissance Records]] record label.\n\nTheir first studio album, ''[[Altars of Madness]]'', was released in 1989, and is regarded by many as one of the most important death metal albums of all time.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.terrorizer.com/news/features-2/the-terrorizer-friday-death-metal-top-15/|title=The Terrorizer Friday Death Metal Top 15 - Terrorizer|date=August 24, 2012|newspaper=Terrorizer|language=en-GB|access-date=January 27, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/morbid-angel-altars-of-madness-best-debut-metal-albums/|title=No. 4: Morbid Angel, 'Altars of Madness' \u2013 Best Debut Metal Albums|website=Loudwire|language=en-US|access-date=January 27, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.treblezine.com/10-essential-death-metal-albums/|title=10 Essential Death Metal Albums|website=www.treblezine.com|language=en-US|access-date=January 27, 2017}}</ref> Music journalist Jason Birchmeier writes that:<blockquote>Few albums struck a chord within the ears and minds of the late-'80s underground metal scene like Morbid Angel's ''Altars of Madness'' did at the end of the decade, setting a new precedent for metal bands to reach. With the arguable exception of [[Chuck Schuldiner]]'s [[Death (metal band)|Death]], never before had a heavy metal band carried their lightning-fast guitar riffs and equally spellbinding guitar solos into such horrific territory. [[Venom (band)|Venom]] and [[Slayer]] redefined the extent to which a metal band could align itself with all things evil during the beginning of the decade, but Morbid Angel made these two groups sound like children's music compared to the Florida-based group's assaulting death metal sounds and their blasphemous lyrics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/altars-of-madness-mw0000311214|title=Altars of Madness - Morbid Angel {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=2017-01-27}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nMorbid Angel toured for nearly two years in support of ''Altars of Madness''. The tour started in November 1989 when they opened for [[Napalm Death]] and [[Bolt Thrower]] in the UK and Europe. Most of 1990 and 1991 were spent touring North America, playing with bands such as [[Pantera]], [[Obituary (band)|Obituary]], [[Atheist (band)|Atheist]], [[Death Angel]], [[Forbidden (band)|Forbidden]], [[Sanctuary (band)|Sanctuary]], [[Ripping Corpse]], [[Deicide (band)|Deicide]], [[Sacrifice (band)|Sacrifice]] and [[Wrath (band)|Wrath]].

These music videos were put on heavy rotation by MTV, and the latter also appeared on the television show ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head|Beavis and Butt-head]]''.
