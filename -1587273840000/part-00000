He was a member of training and assistance teams throughout South-East Asia, and also took part in operations off [[Fiji]] in 2004. He was also part of personal security detachments in [[Iraq War|Iraq]] throughout 2005 and 2006.

On 2 June, the observation post had become the focus of the Anti-Coalition Militia force and repeated attempts to locate and surround the position ensued. In one particular incident the Militia attempted to outflank the observation post. Roberts-Smith was part of a two man team tasked to move out of their relatively secure position in order to locate and neutralise the Militia and regain the initiative. This task was successfully achieved.\n\nIn another incident, two Anti-Coalition Militia attempted to attack the observation post from a different flank, Roberts-Smith again moved to support and neutralise one of these Militia. Roberts-Smith then realised that the forward edge of the observation post was not secure and made the decision to split the team and take up an exposed position forward of the patrol so he could effectively employ his sniper weapon. Whilst isolated, and in his precarious position, he observed a group of sixteen Anti-Coalition Militia advancing across open ground towards the observation post. Roberts-Smith effectively employed his sniper rifle to stop their advance whilst receiving very accurate small arms fire from another group of Militia to his flank. Roberts-Smith maintained the initiative and ensured that his patrol remained secure by holding this position without support for twenty minutes. He was eventually reinforced by his original team member and together they continued to hold off the Militia advance for a further twenty minutes until offensive air support arrived.<ref name=Citation />}}\n\n====Victoria Cross for Australia====\n{{quotation|\nOn 11 June 2010, a troop of the Special Operations Task Group conducted a helicopter assault into Tizak, [[Kandahar province]], in order to capture or kill a senior [[Taliban]] commander.\n\nImmediately upon the helicopter insertion, the troop was engaged by machine gun and [[rocket propelled grenade]] fire from multiple, dominating positions. Two soldiers were wounded in action and the troop was pinned down by fire from three machine guns in an elevated fortified position to the south of the village. Under the cover of close air support, suppressive small arms and machine gun fire, Roberts-Smith and his patrol manoeuvred to within 70 metres of the enemy position in order to neutralise the enemy machine gun positions and regain the initiative.\n\nUpon commencement of the assault, the patrol drew very heavy, intense, effective and sustained fire from the enemy position. Roberts-Smith and his patrol members fought towards the enemy position until, at a range of 40 metres, the weight of fire prevented further movement forward. At this point, he identified the opportunity to exploit some cover provided by a small structure.\n\nAs he approached the structure, Roberts-Smith identified an insurgent grenadier in the throes of engaging his patrol. Roberts-Smith engaged the insurgent at point-blank range resulting in the death of the insurgent. With the members of his patrol still pinned down by the three enemy machine gun positions, he exposed his own position in order to draw fire away from his patrol, which enabled them to bring fire to bear against the enemy. His actions enabled his Patrol Commander to throw a grenade and silence one of the machine guns. Seizing the advantage, and demonstrating extreme devotion to duty and the most conspicuous gallantry, Roberts-Smith, with a total disregard for his own safety, stormed the enemy position killing the two remaining machine gunners.\n\nHis act of valour enabled his patrol to break into the enemy position and to lift the weight of fire from the remainder of the troop who had been pinned down by the machine gun fire. On seizing the fortified gun position, Corporal Roberts-Smith then took the initiative again and continued to assault enemy positions in depth during which he and another patrol member engaged and killed further enemy. His acts of selfless valour directly enabled his troop to go on and clear the village of Tizak of Taliban. This decisive engagement subsequently caused the remainder of the Taliban in [[Shah Wali Kot District]] to retreat from the area.<ref name=Citation />}}\n\nOn receiving the award, Roberts-Smith said he was honoured and humbled;\n\n{{quote|I am so very proud to have taken part in the action with my mates.

Although the two operators had decided it was not necessary to engage the Afghan, when Roberts-Smith and patrol 2IC [[Matthew Locke (soldier)|Matthew Locke]] arrived on-scene they pursued and killed the teenager.<ref>{{cite web|last=McKenzie|first=Nick|authorlink=Nick McKenzie|title=The fog of war and politics leads to controversy over Afghan war mission|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/the-fog-of-war-and-politics-leads-to-controversy-over-afghan-war-mission-20171019-gz47xx.html|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the patrol report had identified only a single Afghan unarmed \"spotter\", Roberts-Smith later claimed that two armed insurgents had approached the position in an oral account provided to the [[Australian War Memorial]].

On 2 June, the observation post had become the focus of the Anti-Coalition Militia force and repeated attempts to locate and surround the position ensued. In one particular incident the Militia attempted to outflank the observation post. Roberts-Smith was part of a two man team tasked to move out of their relatively secure position in order to locate and neutralise the Militia and regain the initiative. This task was successfully achieved.\n\nIn another incident, two Anti-Coalition Militia attempted to attack the observation post from a different flank, Roberts-Smith again moved to support and neutralise one of these Militia. Roberts-Smith then realised that the forward edge of the observation post was not secure and made the decision to split the team and take up an exposed position forward of the patrol so he could effectively employ his sniper weapon. Whilst isolated, and in his precarious position, he observed a group of sixteen Anti-Coalition Militia advancing across open ground towards the observation post. Roberts-Smith effectively employed his sniper rifle to stop their advance whilst receiving very accurate small arms fire from another group of Militia to his flank. Roberts-Smith maintained the initiative and ensured that his patrol remained secure by holding this position without support for twenty minutes. He was eventually reinforced by his original team member and together they continued to hold off the Militia advance for a further twenty minutes until offensive air support arrived.<ref name=Citation />}}\n\n====Victoria Cross for Australia====\n{{quotation|\nOn 11 June 2010, a troop of the Special Operations Task Group conducted a helicopter assault into Tizak, [[Kandahar province]], in order to capture or kill a senior [[Taliban]] commander.\n\nImmediately upon the helicopter insertion, the troop was engaged by machine gun and [[rocket propelled grenade]] fire from multiple, dominating positions. Two soldiers were wounded in action and the troop was pinned down by fire from three machine guns in an elevated fortified position to the south of the village. Under the cover of close air support, suppressive small arms and machine gun fire, Roberts-Smith and his patrol manoeuvred to within 70 metres of the enemy position in order to neutralise the enemy machine gun positions and regain the initiative.\n\nUpon commencement of the assault, the patrol drew very heavy, intense, effective and sustained fire from the enemy position. Roberts-Smith and his patrol members fought towards the enemy position until, at a range of 40 metres, the weight of fire prevented further movement forward. At this point, he identified the opportunity to exploit some cover provided by a small structure.\n\nAs he approached the structure, Roberts-Smith identified an insurgent grenadier in the throes of engaging his patrol. Roberts-Smith engaged the insurgent at point-blank range resulting in the death of the insurgent. With the members of his patrol still pinned down by the three enemy machine gun positions, he exposed his own position in order to draw fire away from his patrol, which enabled them to bring fire to bear against the enemy. His actions enabled his Patrol Commander to throw a grenade and silence one of the machine guns. Seizing the advantage, and demonstrating extreme devotion to duty and the most conspicuous gallantry, Roberts-Smith, with a total disregard for his own safety, stormed the enemy position killing the two remaining machine gunners.\n\nHis act of valour enabled his patrol to break into the enemy position and to lift the weight of fire from the remainder of the troop who had been pinned down by the machine gun fire. On seizing the fortified gun position, Corporal Roberts-Smith then took the initiative again and continued to assault enemy positions in depth during which he and another patrol member engaged and killed further enemy. His acts of selfless valour directly enabled his troop to go on and clear the village of Tizak of Taliban. This decisive engagement subsequently caused the remainder of the Taliban in [[Shah Wali Kot District]] to retreat from the area.<ref name=Citation />}}\n\nOn receiving the award, Roberts-Smith said he was honoured and humbled;\n\n{{quote|I am so very proud to have taken part in the action with my mates.

After converting to Islam, she became an Islamic preacher. In a T.V. interview on the talk show of Anne Will in November 2016, Illi said \"I used to have prejudices against Muslims; I also used to think that Muslim women are all oppressed. However, I discovered that Islam treats women as pearls.\" She added that she came to the conclusion that there are some wrong issues and beliefs which stem from different cultures that have been attributed to Islam but have nothing to do with it in reality. \nIlli confirmed that because of Islam, she started to have self-assertion as a woman, adding that being a Muslim woman, she was never treated as a commodity. She stressed the fact that before she started to wear the face veil, men used to treat her as a commodity and they were attracted only to her body. \nIlli was hosted by several T .V. shows where she voiced several intellectual and political views for both the German and Swiss media.

She took part in several T.V. talk shows and caused heated discussions with her intellectual and political views.\n\n==Early life==\nShe was born as Nora G\u00f6gel on 3 April 1984 in Uster, [[Canton of Z\u00fcrich]].<ref name=\"SAS\">{{cite web|title=Hinter dem Schleier|periodical=[[Schweiz am Sonntag]]|publisher=|url=http://www.schweizamsonntag.ch/ressort/aktuell/1708/|url-status=|format=|access-date=2016-11-08|archive-url=|archive-date=|last=Katia Murmann|date=2011-06-25|language=|pages=|quote=}}</ref><ref name=\"NY\" /> Her father was a well-known Swiss psychotherapist of German origins and her mother was a Swiss social worker.<ref name=\"SAS\" /> They had a divorce years later. Illi was [[baptized]] Catholic upon her own request. As a teen, she promoted individual freedom and anti-establishment views, and at the age of 18, Illi converted to Islam. \nIlli travelled to Dubai, and over there she experienced an [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]] and became enlightened about Islam after she heard the ''[[Adhan]]''. Upon returning to Switzerland, she converted to [[Islam]]. Two weeks later, her husband, Qaasim Illi (he was only her boyfriend then), also became an Islamic convert. Both were active members of the [[Islamic Central Council of Switzerland]] (ICCS).<ref>{{cite web|title=Vorstand IZRS|periodical=|publisher=izrs.ch|url=http://www.izrs.ch/vorstand.html|url-status=|access-date=2016-11-08|archive-url=|archive-date=|last=|date=|year=|language=|pages=|quote=}}</ref> By the age of twenty, Nora Illi wore the [[Niqab]] (face veil) in public. She continued her education in her home town until she was awarded a PhD in [[theology]] from the [[University of Zurich]]. \nIlli chaired the Department of Women Affairs at the Islamic Central Council of Switzerland (ICCS). After converting to Islam, she became an Islamic preacher. In a T.V. interview on the talk show of Anne Will in November 2016, Illi said \"I used to have prejudices against Muslims; I also used to think that Muslim women are all oppressed. However, I discovered that Islam treats women as pearls.\" She added that she came to the conclusion that there are some wrong issues and beliefs which stem from different cultures that have been attributed to Islam but have nothing to do with it in reality. \nIlli confirmed that because of Islam, she started to have self-assertion as a woman, adding that being a Muslim woman, she was never treated as a commodity. She stressed the fact that before she started to wear the face veil, men used to treat her as a commodity and they were attracted only to her body. \nIlli was hosted by several T .V. shows where she voiced several intellectual and political views for both the German and Swiss media. In November 2016, Illi's appearance on the best-known T.V. show of Anne Will caused a lot of controversy and uproar about whether radical opinions should be represented on a T.V. show. Some quotes by Illi were shown during the interview and were interpreted as propaganda for the radical views of the terrorist militia of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]].<ref name=\"nzz161108\"/><ref name=\"nzz161107\"/> Several lawsuits were filed against her as a result of that discussion, but the Hamburg Public Prosecutor office suspended all preliminary investigations in February, 2017.<ref name=\"nzz161108\">Marcel Gyr: ''[http://www.nzz.ch/schweiz/verschleierte-nora-illi-bei-anne-will-bundesanwaltschaft-ist-irritiert-ld.127075 Verschleierte Nora Illi bei \u00abAnne Will\u00bb: Bundesanwaltschaft ist irritiert] \u2013 Der Auftritt der verschleierten Nora Illi am Sonntagabend im \u00f6ffentlichrechtlichen Fernsehen in Deutschland l\u00f6st auch bei der schweizerischen Bundesanwaltschaft Irritationen aus'', [[NZZ]] 8.11.16</ref><ref name=\"nzz161107\">Reiner Stadler: ''[http://www.nzz.ch/schweiz/aktuelle-themen/nora-illi-bei-anne-will-islamistischer-mummenschanz-und-mediale-helfer-ld.126837 Nora Illi bei \u00abAnne Will\u00bb: Islamistischer Mummenschanz und mediale Helfer] \u2013 Eine Schweizerin mit Burka enerviert die deutsche Medienarena.
