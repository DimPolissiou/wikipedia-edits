Built in stages during the [[Middle Ages]]. The oldest part is the nave and the base of the tower, while the youngest part is the large chancel. A large renovation was carried out in the 1960s. Garde Church together with its cemetery and its four [[lychgate]]s constitute one of the most well-preserved medieval church ensembles in Sweden.\n\nThe church is built of limestone and whitewashed. Three of its portals are of a simple, [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] design, typical for the oldest churches on Gotland. The fourth portal, leading to the chancel, is [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] in style. The church contains wall paintings from {{circa}} 1200 in Russo-Byzantine style, almost unique in Sweden. Some of its furnishings, such as the [[baptismal font]] and the [[triumphal cross]] also date from around this time, while the [[altarpiece]] is from the 17th century. It belongs to the [[Church of Sweden]] and lies in the [[Diocese of Visby]].\n\n==Location and surroundings==\nGarde Church and its cemetery forms one of the most well-preserved medieval church ensembles in Sweden.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1972|p=253}} It is located around {{convert|300|m|ft}} north of the main road between [[Ljugarn]] and Lye on eastern Gotland. The area is considered a cultural heritage environment of national interest.<ref name=kyrkomiljon>{{cite web|url= http://www.bebyggelseregistret.raa.se/bbr2/miljo/visaBeskrivning.raa?miljoId=21220000011687&page=beskrivning|title=Gotland kn, Garde kyrka kyrkomilj\u00f6, Gotland|publisher=Riksantikvarie\u00e4mbetet ([[Swedish National Heritage Board]])|language=Swedish|accessdate=17 March 2020}}</ref> The church lies in the centre of the cemetery, which is surrounded by a low wall. The wall has been repaired several times throughout the centuries but never substantially changed since it was built, probably sometime during the [[Middle Ages]].{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1972|p=253}} It is between {{circa}} {{convert|160|cm|inch}} and {{convert|110|cm|inch}} high and has four original lychgates or entrances. The main entrance is the western one, built in three storeys of tufted [[limestone]] and [[whitewash]]ed, except for the corners and the portal. The lychgate originally had two gates, and the covered space between them is equipped with two [[niche (architecture)|niche]]s with seats. The two storeys above have been used as a [[granary]] for storing the church [[tithe]] for a long time. The last time the lychgate was used as a granary was in 1917. The top floor of the lychgate was also used as a magazine for the church. The lychgate, one of the largest medieval lychgates in Sweden, probably dates from the first half of the 13th century.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1972|p=256}}\n\nThe southern and northern lychgates are practically identical, as is the eastern, though it is smaller than the other gates. They are all made of whitewashed tufted limestone with the exception of corners and skirtings which are made of carefully hewn limestone. Inside they have niches with seats. They date from the 14th century.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1972|pp=253\u2013258}} There is also a lychgate that leads to the vicarage, located just northeast of the church, from the road. It is also from the 14th century, and the only one of its kind left on Gotland.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1972|p=252}} A [[mason's mark]] in five places on the northern lychgate is identical to mason's marks found in [[Martebo Church]] and [[St\u00e5nga Church]].{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1972|p=258}} \n\nSeveral graves from the [[Viking Age]], belonging to Christians, have been found in the cemetery, containing fragments of clothes.{{sfn|Andr\u00e9n|2011|pp=199\u2013201}} Before 1739, the layout of the cemetery was such that the richest people were buried closet to the church to the south and east, and poorer people to the west of the church. North of the church was the burial place for criminals.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1972|p=258}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Lychgates of the church\">\nFile:Lychgate na igrexa de Garde.jpg|Western (main) lychgate\nFile:Lychgate na igrexa de Garde 03.jpg|Northern lychgate\nFile:Garde kyrka - KMB - 16000200019440.jpg|Southern lychgate\nFile:Lychgate na igrexa de Garde 02.jpg|Eastern lychgate\nFile:Garda Church yard portal 02.jpg|Lychgate leading to the vicarage\n</gallery>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Portal sur da nave da igrexa de Garde.jpg|thumb|right|The simple round arched southern portal of the nave, typical for the oldest churches on Gotland]]\nThe present church at Lye was possibly preceded by a wooden church, as indicated by holes beneath the floor which may have intended for wooden posts.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1972|p=288}}{{sfn|Andr\u00e9n|2011|pp=199\u2013200}}<ref name=raa>{{cite web|url= http://www.bebyggelseregistret.raa.se/bbr2/byggnad/visaHistorik.raa?byggnadId=21400000444025|title=GOTLAND GARDE KYRKOG\u00c5RDEN 1:1 - husnr 1, GARDE KYRKA|publisher=Riksantikvarie\u00e4mbetet ([[Swedish National Heritage Board]])|language=Swedish|accessdate=21 March 2020}}</ref> These were found during an excavation in 1968.

It was probably built during the middle of the 12th century, perhaps begun around 1130.{{sfn|Andr\u00e9n|2011|pp=199\u2013201}}{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1972|p=290}}<ref name=raa/> A document from the [[Diocese of Link\u00f6ping]], to which Gotland belonged during the Middle Ages, contains a note about an inaugural service in the year 1200.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1972|p=290}} This church would have consisted of a tower, nave, and [[chancel]] with an [[apse]]. The only surviving part of this first stone church is the [[nave (architecture)|nave]].{{sfn|Jacobsson|Johansson|Johansson|Andersson|1990|p=690}} Characteristic for the earliest churches on Gotland is the less finely hewn stone used as building material, the lack of an articulated base or plinth, and the simple [[round arch]]ed entrance portals, all elements found in the nave of Garde Church.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1972|p=290}} The baptismal font and triumphal cross still in the church are from the time and were probably acquired in connection with its inauguration.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1972|p=290}}{{sfn|Jacobsson|Johansson|Johansson|Andersson|1990|p=690}}\n\nDuring the middle of the 13th century, the tower was heightened to its current height. During the first half of the 14th century, the earlier chancel was also replaced by the current, disproportionately large chancel and [[sacristy]]. Probably the intention was to rebuild the whole church, as indicated by the provisional walls that still connect the choir and the nave. The new choir was built by a workshop known by the [[notname]] {{ill|Egypticus|sv}}.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1972|p=291}}<ref name=raa/>\n\nThe church was equipped with a new ceiling in the 1690s, and most of the interior covered with [[whitewash]] in 1701.

The chancel has two large, pointed Gothic windows with [[tracery]]. These are of a type also found e.g. in [[V\u00e4te Church|V\u00e4te]], [[Gr\u00f6tlingbo Church|Gr\u00f6tlingbo]] and [[Hablingbo Church|Hablingbo]] churches.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1972|pp=265\u2013267}}\n\nThe tower has three storeys in addition to the top floor containing the [[church bell]].

After the heightening of the tower, there are now in total twelve comparatively tall openings with pointed arches, three on each side of the tower.

The tower ground floor is comparatively small and dark, and connected with the nave with a narrow but tall decorated arch. The nave gets its light from highly placed, small windows, while the larger chancel gets its light from large Gothic windows in the eastern and southern walls. The chancel arch connecting the nave and chancel is made of finely cut limestone.

This way of representing saints is known from Russia and also from other areas (e.g. [[St Mark's Basilica]] in [[Venice]]), but always from areas under Byzantine influence.{{sfn|Cutler|1969|p=259}} It has been suggested that they depict the saints [[Florus and Laurus]], and the similarities with a similar depiction of these saints in the [[Church of Agioi Anargyroi]] in [[Kastoria]], Greece, has been noted.{{sfn|Tuulse|1971|p=164}}{{sfn|Cutler|1969|pp=259\u2013260}}\n\nSeveral efforts have been made to determine the origins of artist who made these paintings. The first art historian to point out their relation to [[Byzantine art]] was [[Johnny Roosval]] in 1911.{{sfn|Tuulse|1971|p=163}} The following year, a first attempt at finding stylistic parallels in Russian art was made by Ture J. Arne, who suggested a link between the paintings at Garde and the murals in the Russian churches of [[Nereditsa Church|Nereditsa]] and [[St. George's Church, Staraya Ladoga|St. George]] in [[Staraya Ladoga]].{{sfn|Tuulse|1971|p=163}}{{sfn|Arne|1912|p=63}} Later research has also highlighted the similarities with St. George's Church in Staraya Ladoga.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1972|p=301}} The exact nature of the link between these Russian churches and the paintings at Garde remains an open question. It is known that there was a Russian church in [[Visby]] ([[List of church ruins on Gotland|now a ruin]]) and it is possible that a Russian artist went to Gotland to decorate this church, and at the same time decorated the church at Garde.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1972|p=297}} It may also be that traders from Gotland brought a Russian artist to Gotland from the eastern coast of the [[Baltic sea]].{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1972|p=297}} Furthermore, it has been pointed out that the paintings also display possible direct influences from Greek and Sicilian art, as well as Western art, which further complicates any definitive judgment on the origins of the artist who made them.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1972|p=300}} This mixture of influences has led to the hypothesis that the artist was trained in a Russo-Byzantine environment but also worked using [[illuminated manuscript]]s as pattern books.{{sfn|Tuulse|1971|pp=166\u2013167}} Contemporary parallels with Russian and Byzantine illuminated manuscripts have also been pointed out.{{sfn|Tuulse|1971|pp=167\u2013168}}{{sfn|Cutler|1969|p=260}} Wherever the artist may have found the inspiration, it has been underlined that the church was built as a Catholic, and not as an Orthodox church; similarly to the churches of 12th-century Sicily, the artistic influences were derived from Orthodox art \"despite doctrinal and liturgical differences\".{{sfn|Cutler|1969|p=266}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Russo-Byzantine paintings\" heights=\"220px\">\nFile:Garde kyrka - KMB - 16001000149564.jpg|Male saint, southern side\nFile:Arco de entrada \u00e1 torre de Garde.jpg|The arch with the paintings\nFile:Garde kyrka - KMB - 16001000149584.jpg|Male saint, northern side\n</gallery>\n\n==Furnishings==\n[[File:Garda Baptismal font 01.jpg|thumb|right|The baptismal font, a work by Byzantios (late 12th century)]]\nThe [[baptismal font]] of the church dates from the late 12th century and is made by an artist or workshop known by the [[notname]] [[Byzantios]], who made several [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] baptismal fonts influenced by Byzantine art on Gotland.

Built in stages during the [[Middle Ages]]. The oldest part is the nave and the base of the tower, while the youngest part is the large chancel. A large renovation was carried out in the 1960s. Garde Church together with its cemetery and its four [[lychgate]]s constitute one of the most well-preserved medieval church ensembles in Sweden.\n\nThe church is built of limestone and whitewashed. Three of its portals are of a simple, [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] design, typical for the oldest churches on Gotland. The fourth portal, leading to the chancel, is [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] in style. The church contains wall paintings from {{circa}} 1200 in Russo-Byzantine style, almost unique in Sweden. Some of its furnishings, such as the [[baptismal font]] and the [[triumphal cross]] also date from around this time, while the [[altarpiece]] is from the 17th century.

The main entrance is the western one, built in three storeys of tufted [[limestone]] and [[whitewash]]ed, except for the corners and the portal. The lychgate originally had two gates, and the covered space between them is equipped with two [[niche (architecture)|niche]]s with seats. The two storeys above have been used as a [[granary]] for storing the church [[tithe]] for a long time. The last time the lychgate was used as a granary was in 1917. The top floor of the lychgate was also used as a magazine for the church. The lychgate, one of the largest medieval lychgates in Sweden, probably dates from the first half of the 13th century.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1972|p=256}}\n\nThe southern and northern lychgates are practically identical, as is the eastern, though it is smaller than the other gates.

The only surviving part of this first stone church is the [[nave (architecture)|nave]].{{sfn|Jacobsson|Johansson|Johansson|Andersson|1990|p=690}} Characteristic for the earliest churches on Gotland is the less finely hewn stone used as building material, the lack of an articulated base or plinth, and the simple [[round arch]]ed entrance portals, all elements found in the nave of Garde Church.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1972|p=290}} The baptismal font and triumphal cross still in the church are from the time and were probably acquired in connection with its inauguration.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1972|p=290}}{{sfn|Jacobsson|Johansson|Johansson|Andersson|1990|p=690}}\n\nDuring the middle of the 13th century, the tower was heightened to its current height. During the first half of the 14th century, the earlier chancel was also replaced by the current, disproportionately large chancel and [[sacristy]]. Probably the intention was to rebuild the whole church, as indicated by the provisional walls that still connect the choir and the nave. The new choir was built by a workshop known by the [[notname]] {{ill|Egypticus|sv}}.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1972|p=291}}<ref name=raa/>\n\nThe church was equipped with a new ceiling in the 1690s, and most of the interior covered with [[whitewash]] in 1701. Some reconstruction works were carried out in 1869, during which probably the last remaining [[Medieval stained glass in Sweden|medieval stained glass windows]] disappeared. A thorough renovation was carried out in 1963\u201368, during which fragments of medieval wall paintings in the nave were uncovered.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1972|p=291}} Another renovation was done in 2004.<ref name=raa/>\n\n==Architecture==\n===Exterior===\nThe building material of Garde Church is limestone of grey shades, and [[brick]], which is used exclusively in a few decorative elements in the tower facade. The entire church is whitewashed, except the portals, the corners of the chancel, nave and tower, and the plinths of the tower and the chancel \u2014 these are all of more carefully hewn limestone.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1972|p=259}} The church has four entrances, three of which (in the tower, and one on each side of the nave) are simple, round arches [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] portals. The northern portal of the nave may originally have been the entrance to the now vanished, first chancel, and moved to its current location when the church was rebuilt during the 14th century.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1972|pp=259\u2013263}} The southern portal of the chancel is in contrast a decorated [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] portal.

The [[wimperg]] above the portal is decorated with a sculpture of a sitting Christ with one hand resting on a book and the other raised in a gesture of blessing.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1972|p=264}} The nave has six windows, of which four are medieval and of a simple, round arched design. The chancel has two large, pointed Gothic windows with [[tracery]]. These are of a type also found e.g. in [[V\u00e4te Church|V\u00e4te]], [[Gr\u00f6tlingbo Church|Gr\u00f6tlingbo]] and [[Hablingbo Church|Hablingbo]] churches.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1972|pp=265\u2013267}}\n\nThe tower has three storeys in addition to the top floor containing the [[church bell]]. The bell was according to an inscription upon it made in [[L\u00fcbeck]] in 1608 and later re-cast in [[Stockholm]].{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1972|pp=336\u2013337}} Before the tower has enlarged in the 13th century, there were four sound openings at a lower level. After the heightening of the tower, there are now in total twelve comparatively tall openings with pointed arches, three on each side of the tower. The combination of limestone and brick in their decoration is similar to the openings in the church towers at [[Lye Church]] and [[Burs Church]].{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1972|p=270}}\n\n===Interior===\n[[File:Garda Wall cupboard 01.jpg|thumb|right|The former church tabernacle, 14th century. The wooden doors are modern.]]\nThe church interior is divided into three main spaces: the ground floor of the tower to the west, the nave in the middle and the chancel to the east. The tower ground floor is comparatively small and dark, and connected with the nave with a narrow but tall decorated arch. The nave gets its light from highly placed, small windows, while the larger chancel gets its light from large Gothic windows in the eastern and southern walls. The chancel arch connecting the nave and chancel is made of finely cut limestone. The ceilings of the nave and the tower ground floor are flat, wooden ceilings, while the chancel is covered with its original vault.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1972|pp=284\u2013287}} Above the ceiling of the nave, and under the current roof, old well-made Romanesque roof trusses are preserved.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1972|p=284}}{{sfn|Jacobsson|Johansson|Johansson|Andersson|1990|p=690}} The floor of the church largely date from the renovation in the 1960s. At that time, fragments of several [[picture stone]]s were found in the original floor. Some of these have been placed next to the southern wall of the church.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1972|p=332}} There are five [[niche (architecture)|niches]] in the walls of the chancel, dating from the construction period. The largest one of these is a niche with a seat in the southern wall of the chancel, the interior of which is decorated with a painting from the 14th century.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1972|p=287}} The painting depicts Christ seated on a throne.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1972|p=303}} On the northern wall of the choir there is a smaller niche that originally served as a [[church tabernacle]], which also contains decorations from the 14th century inside.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1972|p=287}} The inside of the walls of the church contains a number of carvings, both [[runes|runic inscriptions]] and depictions of ships, the latter probably from the late Middle Ages.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1972|p=304}} No original [[stained glass]] remains in the church, though the chancel windows still contained [[Medieval stained glass in Sweden|medieval stained glass panes]] as late as the 1860s.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1972|p=304}}\n\n====Murals====\n{{See also|Church murals in Sweden}}\nThe entire nave was probably originally decorated with mural paintings. The majority of these are either entirely lost, or survive only in fragments on the walls of the nave.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1972|p=292}} One set of murals are however still very well preserved, on the [[soffit]] of the arch connecting the nave to the ground floor of the tower. These are Russo-Byzantine in style,{{sfn|Andr\u00e9n|2011|pp=199\u2013201}}{{sfn|Jonsson|Lindquist|1987|pp=165\u2013166}} with some influences from [[Gothic art]] discernible in the purely ornamental details.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1972|pp=296\u2013297}} They are almost unique in Sweden.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1972|p=296}} They have never been covered and are recognised as being of high quality;{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1972|p=29}} they have been called \"the best evidence of a byzantinizing workshop on Gotland and as such are justly celebrated\".{{sfn|Cutler|1969|p=258}} It has been suggested that there is a relationship with fragmentary paintings in [[K\u00e4llunge Church|K\u00e4llunge]] and [[Havdhem Church|Havdhem]] churches, but otherwise no comparative paintings exist in Sweden.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1972|p=296}} They were probably made {{circa}} 1200.{{sfn|Tuulse|1971|p=164}}\n\nThe wall paintings depict two male saints standing under arches decorated with [[palmette]]s, supported by pillars with decorated capitals. Each saint is standing upright, tending towards ''[[contrapposto]]'', and faces the viewer, with the left hand raised in a blessing gesture and the other holding a cross.{{sfn|Cutler|1969|p=259}}{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1972|p=301}} They are richly dressed in [[Byzantine dress]]. This way of representing saints is known from Russia and also from other areas (e.g. [[St Mark's Basilica]] in [[Venice]]) , but always from areas under Byzantine influence.{{sfn|Cutler|1969|p=259}} It has been suggested that they depict the saints [[Florus and Laurus]], and the similarities with a similar depiction of these saints in the [[Church of Agioi Anargyroi]] in [[Kastoria]], Greece, has been noted.{{sfn|Tuulse|1971|p=164}}{{sfn|Cutler|1969|pp=259\u2013260}}\n\nSeveral efforts have been made to determine the origins of artist who made these paintings. The first art historian to point out their relation to [[Byzantine art]] was [[Johnny Roosval]] in 1911.{{sfn|Tuulse|1971|p=163}} The following year, a first attempt at finding stylistic parallels in Russian art was made by Ture J. Arne, who suggested a link between the paintings at Garde and the murals in the Russian churches of [[Nereditsa Church|Nereditsa]] and [[St. George's Church, Staraya Ladoga|St. George]] in [[Staraya Ladoga]].{{sfn|Tuulse|1971|p=163}}{{sfn|Arne|1912|p=63}} Later research has also highlighted the similarities with St. George's Church in Staraya Ladoga.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1972|p=301}} The exact nature of the link between these Russian churches and the paintings at Garde remains an open question. It is known that there was a Russian church in [[Visby]] ([[List of church ruins on Gotland|now a ruin]]) and it is possible that a Russian artist went to Gotland to decorate this church, and at the same time decorated the church at Garde.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1972|p=297}} It may also be that traders from Gotland brought a Russian artist to Gotland from the eastern coast of the [[Baltic sea]].{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1972|p=297}} Furthermore, it has been pointed out that the paintings also display possible direct influences from Greek and Sicilian art, as well as Western art, which further complicates any definitive judgment on the origins of the artist who made them.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1972|p=300}} This mixture of influences has led to the hypothesis that the artist was trained in a Russo-Byzantine environment but also worked using [[illuminated manuscript]]s as pattern books.{{sfn|Tuulse|1971|pp=166\u2013167}} Contemporary parallels with Russian and Byzantine illuminated manuscripts have also been pointed out.{{sfn|Tuulse|1971|pp=167\u2013168}}{{sfn|Cutler|1969|p=260}} Wherever the artist may have found the inspiration, it has been underlined that the church was built as a Catholic, and not as an Orthodox church; similarly to the churches of 12th-century Sicily, the artistic influences were derived from Orthodox art \"despite doctrinal and liturgical differences\".{{sfn|Cutler|1969|p=266}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Russo-Byzantine paintings\" heights=\"220px\">\nFile:Garde kyrka - KMB - 16001000149564.jpg|Male saint, southern side\nFile:Arco de entrada \u00e1 torre de Garde.jpg|The arch with the paintings\nFile:Garde kyrka - KMB - 16001000149584.jpg|Male saint, northern side\n</gallery>\n\n==Furnishings==\n[[File:Garda Baptismal font 01.jpg|thumb|right|The baptismal font, a work by Byzantios (late 12th century)]]\nThe [[baptismal font]] of the church dates from the late 12th century and is made by an artist or workshop known by the [[notname]] [[Byzantios]], who made several [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] baptismal fonts influenced by Byzantine art on Gotland. Baptismal fonts similar to the one in Garde exist in [[Atlingbo Church|Atlingbo]] and [[Hogr\u00e4n Church|Hogr\u00e4n]] churches. Like all baptismal fonts by Byzantios, it has an octagonal basin, decorated with figures in low [[relief]] between short columns supporting round arches. Traces of the original paint still remain on the base of the baptismal font; the paint discernible on the basin dates from the middle of the 18th century.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1972|pp=315\u2013318}} The [[altarpiece]] of Garde Church is made of sculpted and painted limestone, and dates from 1689, or possibly 1682. Its central section depicts the [[Last Supper]], and is flanked by two sculptures of [[Moses]] and [[Aaron]]. On top is the [[monogram]] of King [[Charles XI of Sweden]].{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1972|p=306}} The [[pulpit]] was made in 1662, and probably painted in its current colours in 1749.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1972|p=309}} The present [[pew]]s were installed during the 1960s.{{sfn|Lagerl\u00f6f|1972|p=310}} The [[triumphal cross]] of the church consists of a sculpture of Christ, probably made around 1200, mounted on a cross of later date \u2013 probably from the 18th century. The crown is a modern replica made with the triumphal cross in [[Lokrume Church]] as a model.
