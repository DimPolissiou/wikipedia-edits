Later, she became a day pupil at Brighton and Hove High School, close to where her parents lived.\n\nMaureen was the niece of [[Malcolm Muggeridge]], an English journalist and satirist<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0611193/bio|title=Malcolm Muggeridge|website=IMDb|access-date=2019-09-02}}</ref>, but she made her name in a very different field. After graduating in [[Geology]] from the [[University of St Andrews]], she made her own way to [[Perth, Western Australia]], with support from her family. Within a week she got a job with a mining company called [[Tanganyika Holdings]] and was flying over the Outback searching for diamonds. Tanganyika Holdings was involved in a [[joint venture]] with other companies.\n\nIn 1976, minerals were found which suggested the presence of [[diamond]]s. A joint venture was set up with CRA Exploration which they called the Ashton Joint Venture.<ref name=\"glns\">{{Cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/obituaries/geologist-left-no-stone-unturned-in-quest-for-glittering-prize-20101125-188zd.html |title=Geologist left no stone unturned in quest for glittering prize |accessdate=14 July 2011 |date=26 November 2010 |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |publisher=Fairfax Media }}</ref> This was masterminded by Rees Towie, managing director of Northern Mining.

She is a prolific discoverer of almost 200 [[minor planet]]s,<ref name=\"MPC-Discoverers\" /> including the main-belt asteroid [[7794&nbsp;Sanvito]], and a member of the [[American Association of Variable Star Observers]].<ref name=\"tumblingstone\" /><ref name=\"AAVSO\" />\n\nShe is known as the only Italian female [[astrometry|astrometrist]].<ref name=\"springer-Mauratombelli\" /> Together with Italian astronomers [[Ulisse Munari]] and [[Giuseppe Forti]], she initiated a five-year survey of minor planets at [[Asiago Astrophysical Observatory]] in 1994. She also shared a lot of observing with the discoverers, especially the follow-up of [[near-Earth object]]s (NEO), and she contributed to the discovery of [[15817&nbsp;Lucianotesi]], the first NEO found from Italy.

It originally aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the [[United States]] on November 19, 2008. This is the last episode of ''South Park'' to be broadcast in [[480i]] [[standard definition]]. The episode was rated [[TV-MA L]] in the United States. The episode spoofs vampire films including the ''[[Twilight (novel series)|Twilight]]'' craze and ''[[The Lost Boys]]'', where [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] believes that he sees vampires in the school.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Butters Stotch|Butters]] mistakes older students following the vampire craze for actual [[vampire]]s and tries to raise the alarm.  [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] suggests that he go \"document the vampires\" simply to get rid of him.\n\nTaking Cartman's words literally, Butters sneaks into the school gym and hides to record the members of the South Park Vampires' Club on his dictaphone. One of the vampires talks about vampire-related customs and they \"feed\" by drinking [[Clamato]] juice. However, Butters' dictaphone malfunctions, exposing him in front of the vampires. Butters attempts to repel them with a crucifix before running away.\n\nAfter being threatened to be grounded by his parents, Butters thinks aloud, concluding that nobody listens to him. Having come to believe that if he becomes a vampire he will no longer get victimized, he asks the vampire kids to let him join them. They take him to [[Hot Topic]] and change his appearance to match theirs.  Butters returns home to his parents, who are angry at him because of his lateness and his dyed hair. Butters responds that he is now \"ungroundable\" and hisses at his parents, thus completely shocking them.\n\nShortly after, Butters starts wasting away because he believes he is a real vampire and can only feed on blood.  He sneaks into Cartman's room in the middle of the night in a failed attempt to \"feed,\" only managing to give Cartman a [[hickey|Love-bite]]. Butters' parents, alerted by Cartman's mother, ask him if he \"got gay with one of his schoolmates <nowiki>[that]</nowiki> night\". Stephen attempts to confine Butters to his bedroom, but he simply leaps out of the window.\n\nThroughout this episode, the school's [[List of students at South Park Elementary#Goth kids|Goth kids]] loathe the vampire kids with whom they keep getting confused by everyone, including Principal Victoria.  Reluctantly, they decide to switch to a casual look to clear the confusion, but change their mind when they hear someone from the school soccer team describing them as \"that fat girl, the big nose kid, the midget and the kid with pock marks on his face\", which had caused them to become Goths in the first place. After discussing what they could do to stop the vampire craze, the Goth kids decide to get rid of \"the head vampire\", fifth grade student Mike Makowski, whom they kidnap and mail to [[Scottsdale, Arizona|Scottsdale]]. This however fails to solve the problem and just when the Goth kids are about to face defeat from the vampire kids, Butters informs them that Hot Topic is the source of the vampire craze. He takes them there and they [[Arson|burn down the store]].\n\nAt home, Butters tells his parents that the Goth kids burnt down the [[Hot Topic]] and thus has now \"reverted\" back to human and he becomes \"groundable\" once more, much to this parents' relief. In the end, the Goth kids ask for a school assembly in order to explain to everyone the differences between Goth kids and \"douchebag vampire wanna-be boner\" kids, exclaiming, \"Because anyone who thinks they are actually a vampire is freaking retarded.\" They receive a standing ovation, with the eldest Goth kid closing their speech with, \"Fuck all of you\" and flipping everyone off.\n\n==Production==\nThe initial idea for \"The Ungroundable\" was created the week before production, when the team at South Park Studios was working on \"[[Elementary School Musical (South Park)|Elementary School Musical]]\".<ref name=\"Parker\">{{Cite AV media |people=Parker, Trey| date=March 2009 |title=South Park: The Complete Twelfth Season: \"Elementary School Musical\" |medium=Blu-ray Disc |publisher=Paramount Home Entertainment}}</ref> In that episode, Parker had planned to have the school children simply move on to the next [[fad]], which would have been [[The Twilight Saga (film series)|the ''Twilight Saga'' film series]].<ref name=\"Parker\" /> ''[[Twilight (2008 film)|Twilight]]'' had opened in theaters several weeks before and was a phenomenon among tweens and teens, and Parker and Stone realized parodying it would be stronger material for a full episode, rather than a throwaway joke.

In the episode, Mrs. Garrison seeks to become a man again through the help of a new medical procedure. The subplot focuses on Cartman's attempt to teach struggling inner-city school children how to succeed by cheating. This plot is a parody of the 1988 film ''[[Stand and Deliver]]'', with Eric Cartman playing a role similar to that of [[Jaime Escalante]]. The episode was rated [[TV-MA L]] in the United States.\n\nThe episode was written and directed by series co-creator [[Trey Parker]] and co-written by series co-creator [[Matt Stone]].\n\n== Plot summary ==\nThe episode begins with [[Mr. Garrison|Mrs. Garrison]] crying in front of her class as she recounts the story of [[Male pregnancy|a pregnant transsexual]] who appeared on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' a week before the episode's release. She claims that having a baby makes her a woman and that Mrs. Garrison herself is still a man deep down inside. She then explains that she is no longer happy as a woman, but is unable to return to being a man because her penis was destroyed after her [[sex-change operation]] in a [[Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina|previous episode]]. After launching into a rage, Garrison is removed from teaching by Principal Victoria until she gets her personal life in order, and [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] is appointed as temporary teacher in Garrison's place. The kids in class then steal the answer sheet for the next day's test from Garrison's desk, and as a result pass with high scores. Impressed by the high scores, the Denver County school board asks Cartman to teach a struggling inner-city classroom at [[Jim Davis (cartoonist)|Jim Davis]] High School.\n\nMrs. Garrison sees a news report describing how scientists can use a [[Vacanti mouse|mouse to grow a human ear]], and decides to have the same experiment performed on her to get a new penis, but when she opens its cage to look at it, it escapes from the lab and begins to race all over town, causing stereotypical hysterical reactions in all the women who see it.\n\nMeanwhile, Cartman, taking Kyle's warning about the dangers of inner-city students who will \"fucking murder him\", disguises himself as a middle-aged Hispanic named \"Mr. Cartmenez\", and teaches his students how white people are able to succeed even when they cannot: by [[cheating]], citing [[New England Patriots]] head coach [[Bill Belichick]]'s success after cheating in the [[2007 National Football League videotaping controversy|Spygate]] football scandal. Cartman often wonders aloud \"How do I reach these kids?\"  When the kids do amazingly well, they are then challenged to take the hardest, most secure standardized test in the state. When the kids begin to doubt Cartman's methods, he again points to Bill Belichick, implying that after he decided to win a game \"for real\", he ended up losing (to the [[2007 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] in [[Super Bowl XLII]]). The kids are encouraged by this, and all receive perfect scores (by cheating). \n  \nWhile Mrs. Garrison is moping in the park, the mouse with his penis shows up and allows itself to be caught, and Mrs. Garrison undergoes an operation to become Mr. Garrison again. He arrives back at school and explains that he now realizes that the true judge of gender is whether someone can get pregnant. The episode concludes when one teacher objects that his wife cannot have babies because of [[ovarian cancer]], and Mr. Garrison responds with, \"Well then get an AIDS test, Thomson, 'cause your wife's a dude, faggot!...

In the episode, Mrs. Garrison seeks to become a man again through the help of a new medical procedure. The subplot focuses on Cartman's attempt to teach struggling inner-city school children how to succeed by cheating. This plot is a parody of the 1988 film ''[[Stand and Deliver]]'', with Eric Cartman playing a role similar to that of [[Jaime Escalante]]. The episode was rated [[TV-MA L]] in the United States.\n\nThe episode was written and directed by series co-creator [[Trey Parker]] and co-written by series co-creator [[Matt Stone]].\n\n== Plot summary ==\nThe episode begins with [[Mr. Garrison|Mrs. Garrison]] crying in front of her class as she recounts the story of [[Male pregnancy|a pregnant transsexual]] who appeared on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' a week before the episode's release. She claims that having a baby makes her a woman and that Mrs. Garrison herself is still a man deep down inside. She then explains that she is no longer happy as a woman, but is unable to return to being a man because her penis was destroyed after her [[sex-change operation]] in a [[Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina|previous episode]]. After launching into a rage, Garrison is removed from teaching by Principal Victoria until she gets her personal life in order, and [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] is appointed as temporary teacher in Garrison's place. The kids in class then steal the answer sheet for the next day's test from Garrison's desk, and as a result pass with high scores. Impressed by the high scores, the Denver County school board asks Cartman to teach a struggling inner-city classroom at [[Jim Davis (cartoonist)|Jim Davis]] High School.\n\nMrs. Garrison sees a news report describing how scientists can use a [[Vacanti mouse|mouse to grow a human ear]], and decides to have the same experiment performed on her to get a new penis, but when she opens its cage to look at it, it escapes from the lab and begins to race all over town, causing stereotypical hysterical reactions in all the women who see it.  \n\nMeanwhile, Cartman, taking Kyle's warning about the dangers of inner-city students who will \"fucking murder him\", disguises himself as a middle-aged Hispanic named \"Mr. Cartmenez\", and teaches his students how white people are able to succeed even when they cannot: by [[cheating]], citing [[New England Patriots]] head coach [[Bill Belichick]]'s success after cheating in the [[2007 National Football League videotaping controversy|Spygate]] football scandal. Cartman often wonders aloud \"How do I reach these kids?\"  When the kids do amazingly well, they are then challenged to take the hardest, most secure standardized test in the state. When the kids begin to doubt Cartman's methods, he again points to Bill Belichick, implying that after he decided to win a game \"for real\", he ended up losing (to the [[2007 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] in [[Super Bowl XLII]]). The kids are encouraged by this, and all receive perfect scores (by cheating). \n  \nWhile Mrs. Garrison is moping in the park, the mouse with his penis shows up and allows itself to be caught, and Mrs. Garrison undergoes an operation to become Mr. Garrison again. He arrives back at school and explains that he now realizes that the true judge of gender is whether someone can get pregnant. The episode concludes when one teacher objects that his wife cannot have babies because of [[ovarian cancer]], and Mr. Garrison responds with, \"Well then get an AIDS test, Thomson, 'cause your wife's a dude, faggot!... Yeah! I'm back!\" while jumping in the air as the mouse (who grew the penis) lets out a squeak.\n\n== Cultural references ==\n\nA large part of the plot parodies the film ''[[Stand and Deliver (film)|Stand and Deliver]]'' ([[Garfield]] High School / Jim Davis High School), with Cartman assuming a similar role that of [[Jaime Escalante]], although where in the film, the students were falsely accused of cheating, in the episode, the students actually did cheat and got away with it.<ref name=\"AV Club\">{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/south-park-eek-a-penis,12913/|title=South Park: \"Eek, A Penis!\"|publisher=[[The A.V.

In the episode, the nation of Canada, feeling disrespected by the rest of the world, goes on a general strike, demanding money, spurring the boys to raise money by creating a [[viral video]].\n\nWritten and directed by series co-creator [[Trey Parker]], the episode was inspired by the [[2007\u20132008 Writers Guild of America strike]]. It features appearances by the creators of a number of famous viral videos. The episode was rated [[TV-MA L]] in the United States.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Mr. Mackey]] informs the students that it is Canada Appreciation Day and plays a video in which Stephen [[Canadian raising|Abootman]], President of the World Canadian Bureau (initialism: [[2007\u20132008 Writers Guild of America strike|WGA]]),<ref name=\"IGN\">{{cite web|url=http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/864/864427p2.html |title=South Park: Canada on Strike |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=May 4, 2009}}</ref> asks the students to remember all of Canada's contributions to the world.\n\nWhen he asks \"When you think of Canada, what's the one thing that comes to mind?\", [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] responds \"[[Gay]]ness!\" and when Abootman asks, \"What is it that makes Canada so important?\", [[Craig Tucker|Craig]] replies \"Nothing!\" before all the other students laugh and ridicule the Canadians.\n\nIn Canada, Abootman learns of the world's lackluster response to Canada Appreciation Day, and resolves to have the country go on strike, spurring the Canadians to break out into a choreographed song and dance number.\n\nWhen Abootman and his cohorts announce the strike to an assembly of world leaders, the other countries' delegates are confused as to what exactly Canada wants. Abootman responds \"more money\", but when asked where this money should come from, he exclaims \"the Internet makes lots of money. Give us some of that money!\" When the other delegates try to explain that they cannot give Canada money, Abootman is insulted, storms out and shouts that the strike will continue.\n\nLater, [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] is watching [[Ike Broflovski|Ike]], his adopted brother from Canada, stand outside his house, [[Picketing (protest)|picketing]]. Kyle approaches the other boys with worries about his brother, but they are too busy watching ''[[Terrance and Phillip]]'' to care. After realizing that all the ''Terrance and Phillip'' episodes are reruns, they attempt to call Abootman to end the strike, as they refuse to watch horrendous American comedy, represented by a pastiche of ''[[Family Guy]]''. While on the phone with him, they agree that Canada deserves more money but they do not have any to give. In a plan to raise money from the Internet, the boys post a video on \"[[YouTube|YouToob]]\" of Butters singing [[Samwell (entertainer)|Samwell]]'s \"[[What What (In the Butt)]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southparkstudios.com/fans/faq/archives.php?month=6&year=2008|title=FAQ}} South Park Studios.

In an argument over who is more famous, most of the other Internet celebrities kill each other. The boys advance in line, and they receive 10 million \"theoretical dollars\", which are printed on clear plastic [[cheque]]s with no monetary value.\n\nAs the strike continues, many Canadians are dying of starvation, and a news report shows that the United States has brought in Danish people to fill their positions. When Terrance and Phillip question the value of the strike, Abootman questions their loyalty, and vows to continue.\n\nWhen the boys present him their theoretical dollars, Abootman is outraged and refuses to call off the strike until he feels he has won something, at which point Kyle convinces the world leaders to give Canada a consolation prize of bubblegum and [[Bennigan's]] coupons. With the strike settled, the boys go home, where Kyle gives an extremely verbose speech about the current feasibility of generating revenue on the Internet.\n\nAfter Abootman throws a celebration party to celebrate the end of the strike, treating it as a great victory for Canada, Terrance and Phillip gatecrash the party and reveal to the Canadian public that they lost $10.4 million by not working during the strike, while the gumballs and coupons are worth $3,008. As punishment, Abootman and his men are banished by being set adrift on an ice floe.\n\n==Theme==\nThe episode was a criticism of the [[2007\u20132008 Writers Guild of America strike]]. [[TV Squad]]'s Brad Trechak noted that \"Trey Parker and Matt Stone are not members of any of the unions, and they negotiated Internet profit-sharing before it became an issue for the WGA. They have also remained consistent with their dislike of the Hollywood creative elite (including actors and writers, although they are both) and their willingness to take a different viewpoint than the popular media.\"<ref name=\"TV Squad\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2008/04/02/south-park-canada-on-strike/|title=South Park: Canada On Strike!|publisher=[[TV Squad]]|date=April 2, 2008|author=Trechak, Brad|accessdate=May 4, 2009}}</ref> [[IGN]]'s Travis Fickett stated that \"It was probably inevitable that South Park would comment on the writers' strike in some fashion, and here they do \u2013 by way of Canada.\"<ref name=\"IGN\"/> [[The A.V.

A notable part of the episode for him was the viral video, \"What What (In The Butt)\".<ref name=\"AV Club\"/>\n\nTravis Fickett of ''[[IGN]]'' gave the episode a rating of 7.6. He noted that though it was an \"issue\" episode, it was still humorous, unlike other such episodes like \"[[Britney's New Look]]\". Overall, while it wasn't a bad episode \"the show muddles the argument it's trying to make by letting the parallels to Canada get off track.\"<ref name=\"IGN\"/>\n\nBrad Trechak of ''TV Squad'' noted especially \"the battle royal{{sic}} scene with all the YouTube people\" and the \"scintillating conversation\" of the Canadians at the episode end.

In the episode, the nation of Canada, feeling disrespected by the rest of the world, goes on a general strike, demanding money, spurring the boys to raise money by creating a [[viral video]].\n\nWritten and directed by series co-creator [[Trey Parker]], the episode was inspired by the [[2007\u20132008 Writers Guild of America strike]]. It features appearances by the creators of a number of famous viral videos. The episode was rated [[TV-MA L]] in the United States.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Mr. Mackey]] informs the students that it is Canada Appreciation Day and plays a video in which Stephen [[Canadian raising|Abootman]], President of the World Canadian Bureau (initialism: [[2007\u20132008 Writers Guild of America strike|WGA]]),<ref name=\"IGN\">{{cite web|url=http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/864/864427p2.html |title=South Park: Canada on Strike |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=May 4, 2009}}</ref> asks the students to remember all of Canada's contributions to the world. \n\nWhen he asks \"When you think of Canada, what's the one thing that comes to mind?\", [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] responds \"[[Gay]]ness!\" and when Abootman asks, \"What is it that makes Canada so important?\", [[Craig Tucker|Craig]] replies \"Nothing!\" before all the other students laugh and ridicule the Canadians.\n\nIn Canada, Abootman learns of the world's lackluster response to Canada Appreciation Day, and resolves to have the country go on strike, spurring the Canadians to break out into a choreographed song and dance number. \n\nWhen Abootman and his cohorts announce the strike to an assembly of world leaders, the other countries' delegates are confused as to what exactly Canada wants. Abootman responds \"more money\", but when asked where this money should come from, he exclaims \"the Internet makes lots of money. Give us some of that money!\" When the other delegates try to explain that they cannot give Canada money, Abootman is insulted, storms out and shouts that the strike will continue.\n\nLater, [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] is watching [[Ike Broflovski|Ike]], his adopted brother from Canada, stand outside his house, [[Picketing (protest)|picketing]]. Kyle approaches the other boys with worries about his brother, but they are too busy watching ''[[Terrance and Phillip]]'' to care. After realizing that all the ''Terrance and Phillip'' episodes are reruns, they attempt to call Abootman to end the strike, as they refuse to watch horrendous American comedy, represented by a pastiche of ''[[Family Guy]]''. While on the phone with him, they agree that Canada deserves more money but they do not have any to give. In a plan to raise money from the Internet, the boys post a video on \"[[YouTube|YouToob]]\" of Butters singing [[Samwell (entertainer)|Samwell]]'s \"[[What What (In the Butt)]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southparkstudios.com/fans/faq/archives.php?month=6&year=2008|title=FAQ}} South Park Studios.

In an argument over who is more famous, most of the other Internet celebrities kill each other. The boys advance in line, and they receive 10 million \"theoretical dollars\", which are printed on clear plastic [[cheque]]s with no monetary value. \n\nAs the strike continues, many Canadians are dying of starvation, and a news report shows that the United States has brought in Danish people to fill their positions. When Terrance and Phillip question the value of the strike, Abootman questions their loyalty, and vows to continue. \n\nWhen the boys present him their theoretical dollars, Abootman is outraged and refuses to call off the strike until he feels he has won something, at which point Kyle convinces the world leaders to give Canada a consolation prize of bubblegum and [[Bennigan's]] coupons. With the strike settled, the boys go home, where Kyle gives an extremely verbose speech about the current feasibility of generating revenue on the Internet.\n\nAfter Abootman throws a celebration party to celebrate the end of the strike, treating it as a great victory for Canada, Terrance and Phillip gatecrash the party and reveal to the Canadian public that they lost $10.4 million by not working during the strike, while the gumballs and coupons are worth $3,008. As punishment, Abootman and his men are banished by being set adrift on an ice floe.\n\n==Theme==\nThe episode was a criticism of the [[2007\u20132008 Writers Guild of America strike]]. [[TV Squad]]'s Brad Trechak noted that \"Trey Parker and Matt Stone are not members of any of the unions, and they negotiated Internet profit-sharing before it became an issue for the WGA. They have also remained consistent with their dislike of the Hollywood creative elite (including actors and writers, although they are both) and their willingness to take a different viewpoint than the popular media.\"<ref name=\"TV Squad\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2008/04/02/south-park-canada-on-strike/|title=South Park: Canada On Strike!|publisher=[[TV Squad]]|date=April 2, 2008|author=Trechak, Brad|accessdate=May 4, 2009}}</ref> [[IGN]]'s Travis Fickett stated that \"It was probably inevitable that South Park would comment on the writers' strike in some fashion, and here they do \u2013 by way of Canada.\"<ref name=\"IGN\"/> [[The A.V. Club]]'s Josh Modell suggested that \"it's clear that Parker and Stone feel that the writers completely screwed themselves in the long run, but that subplot is almost beside the point.\"<ref name=\"AV Club\">{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/south-park-canada-on-strike,12905/|title=South Park: \"Canada On Strike\"|publisher=[[The A.V.

The strike took place during the making of \"[[The List (South Park)|The List]]\" during which the creators lamented that they had to work instead of joining with the strike.<ref>{{Cite video | people=[[Trey Parker|Parker, Trey]]|date = November 2008|title=South Park: The Complete Twelfth Season: \"Canada on Strike\" |format= |medium= DVD \u2013 audio commentary  |publisher=[[Paramount Pictures#Paramount Home Entertainment|Paramount Home Entertainment]]}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nJosh Modell of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave the episode an A grade, saying that it \"was a great episode because the jokes came quick and funny, not because there was some huge point to be made\". A notable part of the episode for him was the viral video, \"What What (In The Butt)\".<ref name=\"AV Club\"/>\n\nTravis Fickett of ''[[IGN]]'' gave the episode a rating of 7.6. He noted that though it was an \"issue\" episode, it was still humorous, unlike other such episodes like \"[[Britney's New Look]]\". Overall, while it wasn't a bad episode \"the show muddles the argument it's trying to make by letting the parallels to Canada get off track.\"<ref name=\"IGN\"/>\n\nBrad Trechak of ''TV Squad'' noted especially \"the battle royal{{sic}} scene with all the YouTube people\" and the \"scintillating conversation\" of the Canadians at the episode end. Trechak was \"happy to see ''South Park'' get back on track to the focus and humor from the previous seasons.\"<ref name=\"TV Squad\"/>\n\n==Lawsuit==\nIn November 2010, Comedy Central and [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]], Comedy Central's parent company, were sued for copyright infringement for their recreation of the viral video, [[What What (In the Butt)]].<ref name=\"AOL TV\">{{cite web | url=http://www.aoltv.com/2010/11/15/south-park-sued-over-two-year-old-what-what-parody/ | title='South Park' Sued Over Two-Year-Old 'What What' Parody | publisher=[[AOL TV]] | date=November 15, 2010 | accessdate=August 22, 2011 | author=Bentley, Jean}}</ref> The case was dismissed with prejudice before discovery.<ref name=\"Brownmark ruling\">{{cite web | url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3155338777099260349&hl=en&as_sdt=2,5&as_vis=1 | title=Brownmark Films, LLC v.
