After a decade as a university lecturer, he served as a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) from 1974 to 1986. He left the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in 1986 in order to present a new daytime talk show, ''[[Kilroy (TV series)|Kilroy]]'', which ran until 2004. He then served as a [[Member of the European Parliament]] (MEP) from 2004 to 2009. Having been elected as a [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP) candidate, he left in 2005 to found a new party which he called [[Veritas (political party)|Veritas]]. He resigned as its leader later the same year, and sat as an [[independent politician|independent]] MEP for the rest of his term.\n\n==Early life==\nKilroy-Silk was born in [[Birmingham]], Warwickshire, the son of William Silk, a [[Royal Navy]] leading stoker, and his wife Minnie Rose (''n\u00e9e'' Rooke). William Silk was a RN stoker lost at sea when aged 22, serving on {{HMS|Charybdis|88|6}}, which was torpedoed by German torpedo-destroyers on 23 October 1943.<ref>[http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/2487727/SILK,%20WILLIAM] CWGC Casualty Record. The CWGC records his wife as Rose Minnie Silk.</ref> His son was 17 months old.\n\nRobert's mother Rose remarried in 1946, to family friend John Francis Kilroy, a car worker at the [[Rootes Group|Rootes]] plant in [[Warwickshire]]. He adopted the young boy and gave him the first part of his surname; Robert became known as Kilroy-Silk.\n\nKilroy-Silk failed his eleven-plus in 1953; however, he later passed the review and was educated at Saltley Grammar School, [[Saltley]], Birmingham. He attended the [[London School of Economics]] to study politics and economics.<ref>{{cite news | url= https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/09/magazine/09KILROY.html | title= The Anti Europeanist | work=The New York Times | first=Christopher | last=Caldwell | date=9 January 2005 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Marriage and early career==\nIn 1963, Kilroy-Silk married Jan Beech, daughter of a [[shop steward]]. They have a son, a daughter and five grandchildren.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nAfter graduating from college, he became a lecturer in politics at the [[University of Liverpool]], serving from 1966 to 1974.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/the-saturday-profile-robert-kilroysilk-the-selfstyled-saviour-of-britain-731102.html|title=Robert Kilroy-Silk; the self-styled saviour of Britain|last=Valelly|first=Paul|date=5 June 2004|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=2 February 2009}}</ref> He published a theoretical work, ''Socialism since Marx'', in 1972.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/brexit/2019/09/robert-kilroy-silk-godfather-brexit|title=Robert Kilroy-Silk: the godfather of Brexit|first=Patrick|last=Maguire|work=New Statesman|date=18 September 2019|accessdate=22 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Political career==\n===Labour MP===\nAt the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 general election]], Kilroy-Silk was elected as a Labour MP for the [[Ormskirk (UK Parliament constituency)|Ormskirk]] constituency in [[Lancashire]].  He remained its MP until its abolition at the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]], when he was elected to represent the new [[Knowsley North (UK Parliament constituency)|Knowsley North]] seat; he held this until his [[resignation from the British House of Commons|resignation from the House of Commons]] in 1986. In an article for ''[[The Times]]'' in 1975, Kilroy-Silk argued that politics was not \"compromises and bargains\" or hankering after \"a spurious consensus\". He wrote that the function of government, particularly a Labour government, was \n<blockquote>\"to impose its values on society. Its role is creative: to cast, so far as it is able, society in its image\". Furthermore, socialists should not be worried about being accused of dictatorial powers; they must go forward with \"a tint of arrogance\".<ref>Robert Kilroy-Silk, \"Labour must not be frightened of making socialism work\", ''The Times'', 29 April 1975.</ref></blockquote>The next year he was quoted as saying, \"the Labour Party must always be a class party, for it is a class war we are fighting\".<ref name=\"counterpoint20101108\">{{cite episode | title=The UK in the 1970s | series=Counterpoint | credits=Comrie-Thomson, Paul; Coombe, Ian | network=Australian Broadcasting Corporation | airdate=8 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nKilroy-Silk was appointed Shadow Home Affairs spokesman, but resigned in 1985. In resigning his seat, he said that he had been assaulted by members of the [[Militant (Trotskyist group)|Militant]] group and was reported to have had a scuffle with left-wing Labour MP [[Jeremy Corbyn]].<ref>Robert Chalmers [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/robert-kilroysilk-here-comes-trouble-6168308.html \"Robert Kilroy-Silk: Here Comes Trouble\"], ''Independent on Sunday'', 6 June 2004. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141121022340/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/robert-kilroysilk-here-comes-trouble-6168308.html |date=21 November 2014 }}</ref> He wrote a book about his experiences, entitled ''Hard Labour'', and subsequently left the Labour Party.\n\n===UK Independence Party===\n\n====European Parliament====\nIn 2004, Kilroy-Silk was recruited to the [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP). During that year's [[2004 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|European Parliament election]] campaign he presented one of the [[party political broadcast]]s. His recruitment raised the profile of the party, as did support by actress [[Joan Collins]]. She attended a UKIP press conference at Kilroy-Silk's invitation. Kilroy-Silk successfully stood for the Party in the [[East Midlands (European Parliament constituency)|East Midlands constituency]].\n\nThe election used a [[closed list]] form of [[proportional representation]]; UKIP scored 26.05 per cent of the vote in that region, just behind the Conservatives with 26.39 per cent. Kilroy-Silk was elected as a [[Member of the European Parliament]] (MEP) in the second seat for his region.\n\n====Leadership====\nIn the [[2004 Hartlepool by-election]], UKIP came third, ahead of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. The next day, in an interview on ''[[Breakfast with Frost]]'' ([[BBC]]), Kilroy-Silk expressed ambition to lead UKIP and criticised the party's leader [[Roger Knapman]].\n\nFollowing this, businessman and friend [[Paul Sykes (businessman)|Paul Sykes]] announced his intention to cease his partial funding of UKIP and to return his support to the Conservatives, as he feared that the [[Euroscepticism|Euro-sceptic]] vote might be split. The branch chairmen of UKIP were canvassed on their opinion regarding Kilroy-Silk's challenge for the party leadership. Only a minority (13%) were sympathetic to him; Kilroy-Silk did not think this was significant, as he believed that too few party members had been consulted. Party officials threatened him with disciplinary action if he continued his challenge.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nOn 27 October 2004, Kilroy-Silk officially announced that he had withdrawn from the UKIP whip in the European Parliament, branding the party \"incompetent\". But, he said that he would remain as an independent member of UKIP, and would continue to challenge for the leadership.\n\nUKIP's constitution states that 70 days' notice is required before a leadership ballot can take place. With the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|next general election in the UK]] expected in spring 2005, Kilroy-Silk pushed for an emergency general meeting of the party as early as possible. On 3 November 2004, Kilroy-Silk said he intended to be leader by Christmas, though this would have been impossible under the rules.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nOn 20 January 2005, Kilroy-Silk announced that he had left UKIP; he had been a member for nine months.\n\n===Veritas===\nOn 30 January 2005, the launching of a new political party, [[Veritas (political party)|Veritas]], was confirmed. [[Damian Hockney]], UKIP's leader in the [[London Assembly]], had defected to Veritas, becoming its first Deputy Leader.\n\nUKIP members and some journalists dubbed Kilroy-Silk's new party \"Vanitas\", meaning a party acting as a vehicle for its founder's vanity.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/jan/17/otherparties.uk|title=Kilroy asked to leave Ukip|last=Tempest|first=Matthew|date=2005-01-17|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-09-27|last2=agencies|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\nThe party was formally launched on 2 February 2005 at Hinckley Golf Club in [[Hinckley]], Leicestershire. In the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]], Kilroy-Silk contested the seat of [[Erewash (UK Parliament constituency)|Erewash]], but came in fourth, barely saving his deposit. He tried to press charges against a man who he claimed \"smashed a bottle of water against the side of his head\" while the politician was being interviewed by a European television crew outside a supermarket. The alleged assailant said he had squirted Kilroy-Silk with water from a plastic bottle before running away; this account was confirmed by the TV crew, which also filmed the incident. The police decided not to prosecute.\n\nOn 12 July 2005, party member Ken Wharton announced his intention to challenge Kilroy-Silk for the leadership, claiming party members were \"not being looked after\". Discontented party members set up the Veritas Members' Association to \"put the truth back into Veritas\".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4675795.stm | work=BBC News | title=Kilroy faces leadership challenge | date=12 July 2005 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn 29 July 2005, Veritas announced the resignation of Kilroy-Silk as party leader.<ref name=\"resign\">{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4728941.stm | work=BBC News | title=Kilroy quits as leader of Veritas | date=29 July 2005 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}</ref> In his resignation statement, he said: \n<blockquote>\"It was clear from the general election result \u2013 and more recently that of the [[2005 Cheadle by-election|Cheadle by-election]] \u2013 that the electors are content with the old parties and that it would be virtually impossible for a new party to make a significant impact given the nature of our electoral system. We tried and failed.\"<ref name=\"resign\"/></blockquote>\n\nIn August 2005, four of the MEPs for the East Midlands region (Clark, Heaton-Harris, Helmer and Whitehead) sent a joint letter to President of the European Parliament [[Josep Borrell]] complaining about Kilroy-Silk: \n<blockquote>\"He seems to have done little or no work as a constituency MEP for the East Midlands. This leaves five MEPs to do the work of six and the electorate have been short-changed\". They went on to complain that Kilroy-Silk was not \"fulfilling the pledge he made on becoming an MEP, to serve the electorate of his region\" and to call for him to \"either do the job for which he is paid, or get out and leave it to those who can.\"<ref name=\"kilroy\">Stares, Justin.

[...] His four regional colleagues \u2013 Christopher Heaton-Harris (Conservative), Roger Helmer (Conservative), Phillip Whitehead (Labour) and Derek Clark (Ukip) \u2013 said they \"deplore\" Mr Kilroy-Silk's non-attendance. \"He seems to have done little or no work as a constituency MEP for the East Midlands.

Some Veritas members were reported questioning why he was allowed to continue as a party member.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nKilroy-Silk's name was absent from the list of candidates published on 7 May 2009 for the [[2009 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|2009 European Parliament election]].

According to Faisal Bodi, a columnist for ''[[The Guardian]]'', the reaction at its second publication was a measure of \"the increasing organisation of the Muslim community\". Bodi added:\n \n{{quote|Kilroy-Silk's suspension was precipitated by a flurry of web messages and emails circulated by various Muslim organisations notifying people of the outrage.

After a decade as a university lecturer, he served as a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) from 1974 to 1986. He left the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in 1986 in order to present a new daytime talk show, ''[[Kilroy (TV series)|Kilroy]]'', which ran until 2004. He then served as a [[Member of the European Parliament]] (MEP) from 2004 to 2009. Having been elected as a [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP) candidate, he left in 2005 to found a new party which he called [[Veritas (political party)|Veritas]]. He resigned as its leader later the same year, and sat as an [[independent politician|independent]] MEP for the rest of his term.\n\n==Early life==\nKilroy-Silk was born in [[Birmingham]], Warwickshire, the son of William Silk, a [[Royal Navy]] leading stoker, and his wife Minnie Rose (''n\u00e9e'' Rooke). William Silk was a RN stoker lost at sea when aged 22, serving on {{HMS|Charybdis|88|6}}, which was torpedoed by German torpedo-destroyers on 23 October 1943.<ref>[http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/2487727/SILK,%20WILLIAM] CWGC Casualty Record. The CWGC records his wife as Rose Minnie Silk.</ref> His son was 17 months old.\n\nRobert's mother Rose remarried in 1946, to family friend John Francis Kilroy, a car worker at the [[Rootes Group|Rootes]] plant in [[Warwickshire]]. He adopted the young boy and gave him the first part of his surname; Robert became known as Kilroy-Silk.\n\nKilroy-Silk failed his eleven-plus in 1953; however, he later passed the review and was educated at Saltley Grammar School, [[Saltley]], Birmingham. He attended the [[London School of Economics]] to study politics and economics.<ref>{{cite news | url= https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/09/magazine/09KILROY.html | title= The Anti Europeanist | work=The New York Times | first=Christopher | last=Caldwell | date=9 January 2005 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Marriage and early career==\nIn 1963, Kilroy-Silk married Jan Beech, daughter of a [[shop steward]].

He remained its MP until its abolition at the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]], when he was elected to represent the new [[Knowsley North (UK Parliament constituency)|Knowsley North]] seat; he held this until his [[resignation from the British House of Commons|resignation from the House of Commons]] in 1986. In an article for ''[[The Times]]'' in 1975, Kilroy-Silk argued that politics was not \"compromises and bargains\" or hankering after \"a spurious consensus\". He wrote that the function of government, particularly a Labour government, was \n<blockquote>\"to impose its values on society. Its role is creative: to cast, so far as it is able, society in its image\". Furthermore, socialists should not be worried about being accused of dictatorial powers; they must go forward with \"a tint of arrogance\".<ref>Robert Kilroy-Silk, \"Labour must not be frightened of making socialism work\", ''The Times'', 29 April 1975.</ref></blockquote>The next year he was quoted as saying, \"the Labour Party must always be a class party, for it is a class war we are fighting\".<ref name=\"counterpoint20101108\">{{cite episode | title=The UK in the 1970s | series=Counterpoint | credits=Comrie-Thomson, Paul; Coombe, Ian | network=Australian Broadcasting Corporation | airdate=8 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nKilroy-Silk was appointed Shadow Home Affairs spokesman, but resigned in 1985. In resigning his seat, he said that he had been assaulted by members of the [[Militant (Trotskyist group)|Militant]] group and was reported to have had a scuffle with left-wing Labour MP [[Jeremy Corbyn]].<ref>Robert Chalmers [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/robert-kilroysilk-here-comes-trouble-6168308.html \"Robert Kilroy-Silk: Here Comes Trouble\"], ''Independent on Sunday'', 6 June 2004. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141121022340/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/robert-kilroysilk-here-comes-trouble-6168308.html |date=21 November 2014 }}</ref> He wrote a book about his experiences, entitled ''Hard Labour'', and subsequently left the Labour Party.\n\n===UK Independence Party===\n\n====European Parliament====\nIn 2004, Kilroy-Silk was recruited to the [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP). During that year's [[2004 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|European Parliament election]] campaign he presented one of the [[party political broadcast]]s. His recruitment raised the profile of the party, as did support by actress [[Joan Collins]]. She attended a UKIP press conference at Kilroy-Silk's invitation. Kilroy-Silk successfully stood for the Party in the [[East Midlands (European Parliament constituency)|East Midlands constituency]].\n\nThe election used a [[closed list]] form of [[proportional representation]]; UKIP scored 26.05 per cent of the vote in that region, just behind the Conservatives with 26.39 per cent. Kilroy-Silk was elected as a [[Member of the European Parliament]] (MEP) in the second seat for his region.\n\n====Leadership====\nIn the [[2004 Hartlepool by-election]], UKIP came third, ahead of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. The next day, in an interview on ''[[Breakfast with Frost]]'' ([[BBC]]), Kilroy-Silk expressed ambition to lead UKIP and criticised the party's leader [[Roger Knapman]].\n\nFollowing this, businessman and friend [[Paul Sykes (businessman)|Paul Sykes]] announced his intention to cease his partial funding of UKIP and to return his support to the Conservatives, as he feared that the [[Euroscepticism|Euro-sceptic]] vote might be split. The branch chairmen of UKIP were canvassed on their opinion regarding Kilroy-Silk's challenge for the party leadership. Only a minority (13%) were sympathetic to him; Kilroy-Silk did not think this was significant, as he believed that too few party members had been consulted. Party officials threatened him with disciplinary action if he continued his challenge.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nOn 27 October 2004, Kilroy-Silk officially announced that he had withdrawn from the UKIP whip in the European Parliament, branding the party \"incompetent\". But, he said that he would remain as an independent member of UKIP, and would continue to challenge for the leadership.\n\nUKIP's constitution states that 70 days' notice is required before a leadership ballot can take place. With the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|next general election in the UK]] expected in spring 2005, Kilroy-Silk pushed for an emergency general meeting of the party as early as possible. On 3 November 2004, Kilroy-Silk said he intended to be leader by Christmas, though this would have been impossible under the rules.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nOn 20 January 2005, Kilroy-Silk announced that he had left UKIP; he had been a member for nine months.\n\n===Veritas===\nOn 30 January 2005, the launching of a new political party, [[Veritas (political party)|Veritas]], was confirmed. [[Damian Hockney]], UKIP's leader in the [[London Assembly]], had defected to Veritas, becoming its first Deputy Leader.\n\nUKIP members and some journalists dubbed Kilroy-Silk's new party \"Vanitas\", meaning a party acting as a vehicle for its founder's vanity.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/jan/17/otherparties.uk|title=Kilroy asked to leave Ukip|last=Tempest|first=Matthew|date=2005-01-17|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-09-27|last2=agencies|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\nThe party was formally launched on 2 February 2005 at Hinckley Golf Club in [[Hinckley]], Leicestershire. In the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]], Kilroy-Silk contested the seat of [[Erewash (UK Parliament constituency)|Erewash]], but came in fourth, barely saving his deposit. He tried to press charges against a man who he claimed \"smashed a bottle of water against the side of his head\" while the politician was being interviewed by a European television crew outside a supermarket. The alleged assailant said he had squirted Kilroy-Silk with water from a plastic bottle before running away; this account was confirmed by the TV crew, which also filmed the incident. The police decided not to prosecute.\n\nOn 12 July 2005, party member Ken Wharton announced his intention to challenge Kilroy-Silk for the leadership, claiming party members were \"not being looked after\". Discontented party members set up the Veritas Members' Association to \"put the truth back into Veritas\".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4675795.stm | work=BBC News | title=Kilroy faces leadership challenge | date=12 July 2005 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn 29 July 2005, Veritas announced the resignation of Kilroy-Silk as party leader.<ref name=\"resign\">{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4728941.stm | work=BBC News | title=Kilroy quits as leader of Veritas | date=29 July 2005 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}</ref> In his resignation statement, he said: \n<blockquote>\"It was clear from the general election result \u2013 and more recently that of the [[2005 Cheadle by-election|Cheadle by-election]] \u2013 that the electors are content with the old parties and that it would be virtually impossible for a new party to make a significant impact given the nature of our electoral system.

This leaves five MEPs to do the work of six and the electorate have been short-changed\". They went on to complain that Kilroy-Silk was not \"fulfilling the pledge he made on becoming an MEP, to serve the electorate of his region\" and to call for him to \"either do the job for which he is paid, or get out and leave it to those who can.\"<ref name=\"kilroy\">Stares, Justin.

Mentored by historian and comparative religion scholar [[John B. Carman]], Chinese religion scholar [[Tu Weiming]], and medical anthropologist [[Arthur Kleinman]], her early ethnographic work centered on Chinese healing practices in the United States, particularly in the region of [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. Her subsequent research  explores relationships between [[cultural]], [[religious]]/[[spirituality|spiritual]], and therapeutic pluralism\u2014particularly in the United States\u2014and [[complementary and alternative]] and [[integrative medicine]].\n\nSince 1999, Barnes has been a member of the faculty of [[Boston University School of Medicine]] (BUSM), where she founded and directed an urban ethnographic program\u2014the Boston Healing Landscape Project (BHLP), a program for the study of religions, medicines, and healing funded by the [[Ford Foundation]] from 2001 to 2007. The BHLP's research focused on complementary and alternative medicine among the culturally complex patient communities in the Boston area. In 2007, with [[Lance Laird]], she co-founded the Master of Science Program in medical anthropology and cross-cultural practice, in the [[Division of Graduate Medical Sciences]] at BUSM (<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bumc.bu.edu/gms/maccp/|title=MACCP Home {{!}} Graduate Medical Sciences|website=www.bumc.bu.edu|language=en}}</ref>).\n\n==Academic work==\nBarnes has published her ethnographic work in leading medical anthropology journals such as ''[[Culture, Medicine & Psychiatry]]'', ''[[Medical Anthropology]]'', ''[[Medical Anthropology Quarterly]]'', and ''[[Social Science & Medicine]]''. Her historical scholarship appears in her book ''[[Needles, Herbs, Gods, and Ghosts: China, Healing, and the West to 1848]]'' (Harvard University Press, 2005). This anthropologically influenced cultural history examines how understandings of medicine, religion, race, and the body informed how Westerners in both Europe and later the U.S. understood and responded to the Chinese and their healing traditions from the thirteenth century through 1848.\n\nMore recently, she published ''Chinese Medicine and Healing: An Illustrated History'' (co-edited with [[TJ Hinrichs]], Harvard University Press, 2013). She is currently writing a book on the cultural and social history of Chinese medicine and healing traditions in the United States, beginning in 1849 and continuing up through the present. As part of this project, Barnes has conducted fieldwork funded by the [[National Library of Medicine]], and gathered hundreds of oral histories in regions throughout the United States, while also building an archive of related source materials.\n\nA second major scholarly area to which Barnes has contributed is the interdisciplinary and cross-cultural study of relationships between religious, medical, and therapeutic traditions. She founded the \"Religions, Medicines, and Healing Group\" program unit of the American Academy of Religion (AAR) in 2002, and served as co-chair until 2010, when she moved to the group's steering committee. Her related books include ''[[Religion and Healing in America]]'' (co-edited with [[Susan S.

Advertising executive Roger Thornhill summons the same waiter and Thornhill is, apparently for that reason, mistaken for Kaplan, kidnapped, brought to the [[Long Island]] estate of Lester Townsend and interrogated by spy Phillip Vandamm. Despite Thornhill's denials, Vandamm thinks he is lying and has henchman Leonard arrange Thornhill's death, in a staged drunken driving accident. Thornhill, surviving, is arrested for [[driving under the influence]] and taken to the [[Glen Cove, New York]] police station.\n\nThornhill fails to convince his mother and the police of what happened. Journeying to the scene of the crime with police, a woman at Townsend's home says he showed up drunk at her dinner party. She also claims that Townsend is a [[United Nations]] [[diplomat]]. \nWhile searching a hotel room with his mother that appears to belong to Kaplan, Thornhill answers a phone call from thugs who are in the lobby. He escapes and visits the [[Headquarters of the United Nations|U.N. General Assembly building]] to meet Townsend but realizes this person  is ''not'' the man he met on [[Long Island]]. As he questions Townsend, one of the thugs throws a knife, killing Townsend. Thornhill catches Townsend as he falls and grabs the knife, which gives the appearance that he was the murderer. A nearby photographer captures this apparent crime; Thornhill flees and attempts to find the real Kaplan.\n\nA government intelligence agency realizes that Thornhill has been mistaken for Kaplan, an imagined persona created by the agency to thwart Vandamm; they decide against rescuing him for fear of compromising their operation.\n\n[[File:North by Northwest movie trailer screenshot (8).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|Thornhill stopping a truck while being attacked by the crop duster, from the film trailer]]\nThornhill sneaks onto a train, the ''[[20th Century Limited]]''. On the train, he meets Eve Kendall, who hides him from the police; the two establish a relationship\u2014on her part because she is secretly working with Vandamm. In [[Chicago]], she tells Thornhill she arranged a meeting with Kaplan at an isolated bus stop in a rural area. Thornhill waits there, but rather than Kaplan arriving, Thornhill is attacked by a [[Aerial application|crop duster]] plane. After trying to hide in the fields, he steps in front of a speeding [[tank truck]]; it brakes for him and the airplane crashes into it, allowing him to escape.\n\nThornhill reaches Kaplan's hotel in Chicago to discover that Kaplan had already checked out and left before the time when Kendall claimed she talked to him on the phone. When Thornhill goes to her room and confronts her, she leaves; he tracks her to an art auction where he finds Vandamm. Vandamm, who is purchasing a Mexican [[Pur\u00e9pecha]] statue, leaves his thugs to deal with Thornhill. Thornhill, in order to escape, disrupts the auction and police are summoned, who take him away. He explains that he is the fugitive murderer and they release him to the government agency's chief, \"The Professor\"; who reveals that Kaplan was invented to distract Vandamm from the real government agent\u2014who is Eve Kendall. Thornhill agrees to help maintain her cover.\n\nAt the [[Mount Rushmore]] visitor center, Thornhill\u2014now willingly playing the role of Kaplan\u2014negotiates Vandamm's turnover of Kendall for her prosecution as a spy. When Thornhill appears to confront Kendall, she shoots him, seemingly fatally, with a handgun that is actually loaded with [[Blank (cartridge)|blanks]] and flees.\n\nAfterward, the Professor arranges for Thornhill and Kendall to meet. Thornhill discovers Kendall must depart with Vandamm and Leonard on a plane. When Thornhill tries to dissuade her from going, he is knocked unconscious and locked in a hospital room. Thornhill escapes the Professor's custody and goes to Vandamm's house to rescue Kendall.\n\n[[File:North by Northwest movie trailer screenshot (28).jpg|thumb|right|The climax at Mount Rushmore]]\nAt the house, Thornhill overhears that the sculpture holds [[Microform|microfilm]] and that Leonard discovered that the gun used by Kendall to kill Thornhill was filled with blanks. Vandamm indicates that he will kill Kendall during the flight. Thornhill warns her with a surreptitious note. Vandamm, Leonard and Kendall depart the house to board the plane. As Vandamm boards the plane, Kendall takes the sculpture and runs to the pursuing Thornhill. They flee to the top of Mount Rushmore. As they climb down the mountain they are pursued by Vandamm's thugs, including Leonard, who is fatally shot by a park ranger. Vandamm is taken into custody by the Professor.\n\nKendall meanwhile is hanging on by her fingertips on the mountain.  Thornhill reaches down to pull her up, at which point the scene cuts to him pulling her\u2014now the new Mrs. Thornhill\u2014into the upper [[Berth (sleeping)#Berths in trains|berth]] of a train. The train then enters a tunnel.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Cary Grant]] as Roger Thornhill\n* [[Eva Marie Saint]] as Eve Kendall\n* [[James Mason]] as Phillip Vandamm\n* [[Jessie Royce Landis]] as Clara Thornhill\n* [[Leo G.

Composer [[Bernard Herrmann]] had recommended that Hitchcock work with his friend [[Ernest Lehman]]. After a couple of weeks, Lehman offered to quit saying he didn't know what to do with the story. Hitchcock told him they got along great together and they would just write something else. Lehman said that he wanted to make the ultimate Hitchcock film. Hitchcock thought for a moment then said he had always wanted to do a chase across [[Mount Rushmore]]. Lehman and Hitchcock spitballed more ideas: a murder at the United Nations Headquarters; a murder at a car plant in Detroit; a final showdown in Alaska. Eventually they settled on the U.N. murder for the opening and the chase across Mount Rushmore for the climax. For the central idea, Hitchcock remembered something an American journalist had told him about spies creating a fake agent as a decoy. Perhaps their hero could be mistaken for this fictitious agent and end up on the run. They bought the idea from the journalist for $10,000.}}\n\nLehman repeated this story in the documentary ''[[Destination Hitchcock: The Making of North by Northwest]]'' that accompanied the 2001 DVD release of the film. Screenwriter [[William Goldman]] insists in ''[[Which Lie Did I Tell?]]'' (2000) that it was Lehman who created ''North by Northwest'' and that many of Hitchcock's ideas were not used. Hitchcock had the idea of the hero being stranded in the middle of nowhere, but suggested that the villains try to kill him with a [[tornado]]. Lehman responded, \"but ''they're'' trying to kill him. How are ''they'' going to work up a cyclone?\" Then, as he told an interviewer, \"I just can't tell you who said what to whom, but somewhere during that afternoon, the cyclone in the sky became the crop-duster plane.\"<ref name=\"brady202\">{{Harvnb|Brady|1981|p=202}}</ref>\n\nIn fact, Hitchcock had been working on the story for nearly nine years prior to meeting Lehman.{{cn|date=January 2020}} [[Otis Guernsey]] was the American journalist who had the idea which influenced Hitchcock, inspired by a true story during [[World War II]] when [[British Intelligence]] obtained a dead body, invented a [[Operation Mincemeat#Major William Martin, Royal Marines|fictitious officer]] who was carrying secret papers, and arranged for the body and misleading papers to be discovered by the Germans as a disinformation scheme called [[Operation Mincemeat]].

In his book-length interview ''Hitchcock/Truffaut'' (1967) with [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]], Hitchcock said that he wanted to do \"something fun, light-hearted, and generally free of the symbolism permeating his other movies.\"<ref>Hitchcock was not above inserting a [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] joke as the last shot, which, notably, eluded contemporary censors.</ref> Writer Ernest Lehman has also mocked those who look for symbolism in the film.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brady|1981|pp=199\u2013200}}</ref> Despite its popular appeal, the film is considered to be a masterpiece for its themes of [[deception]], [[mistaken identity]], and [[moral relativism]] in the [[Cold War]] era.\n\nThe title ''North by Northwest'' is a subject of debate.

Other titles were considered, including \"The Man on Lincoln's Nose\", but \"North by Northwest\" was kept because, according to Lehman, \"We never did find a [better] title.\"<ref name=\"brady201\" /> The [[Northwest Airlines]] reference in the film plays on the title.\n\nThe film's plot involves a \"[[MacGuffin]]\", a term popularized by Hitchcock&nbsp;\u2014 a physical object that everyone in the film is chasing, but which has no deep relationship to the plot.

Advertising executive Roger Thornhill summons the same waiter and Thornhill is, apparently for that reason, mistaken for Kaplan, kidnapped, brought to the [[Long Island]] estate of Lester Townsend and interrogated by spy Phillip Vandamm. Despite Thornhill's denials, Vandamm thinks he is lying and has henchman Leonard arrange Thornhill's death, in a staged drunken driving accident. Thornhill, surviving, is arrested for [[driving under the influence]] and taken to the [[Glen Cove, New York]] police station.\n\nThornhill fails to convince his mother and the police of what happened. Journeying to the scene of the crime with police, a woman at Townsend's home says he showed up drunk at her dinner party. She also claims that Townsend is a [[United Nations]] [[diplomat]]. \nWhile searching a hotel room with his mother that appears to belong to Kaplan, Thornhill answers a phone call from thugs who are in the lobby. He escapes and visits the [[Headquarters of the United Nations|U.N. General Assembly building]] to meet Townsend but realizes this person  is ''not'' the man he met on [[Long Island]]. As he questions Townsend, one of the thugs throws a knife, killing Townsend. Thornhill catches Townsend as he falls and grabs the knife, which gives the appearance that he was the murderer. A nearby photographer captures this apparent crime; Thornhill flees and attempts to find the real Kaplan.\n\nA government intelligence agency realizes that Thornhill has been mistaken for Kaplan, an imagined persona created by the agency to thwart Vandamm; they decide against rescuing him for fear of compromising their operation.\n\n[[File:North by Northwest movie trailer screenshot (8).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|Thornhill stopping a truck while being attacked by the crop duster, from the film trailer]]\nThornhill sneaks onto a train, the ''[[20th Century Limited]]''. On the train, he meets Eve Kendall, who hides him from the police; the two establish a relationship\u2014on her part because she is secretly working with Vandamm. In [[Chicago]], she tells Thornhill she arranged a meeting with Kaplan at an isolated bus stop in a rural area. Thornhill waits there, but rather than Kaplan arriving, Thornhill is attacked by a [[Aerial application|crop duster]] plane. After trying to hide in the fields, he steps in front of a speeding [[tank truck]]; it brakes for him and the airplane crashes into it, allowing him to escape.\n\nThornhill reaches Kaplan's hotel in Chicago to discover that Kaplan had already checked out and left before the time when Kendall claimed she talked to him on the phone. When Thornhill goes to her room and confronts her, she leaves; he tracks her to an art auction where he finds Vandamm. Vandamm, who is purchasing a Mexican [[Pur\u00e9pecha]] statue, leaves his thugs to deal with Thornhill. Thornhill, in order to escape, disrupts the auction and police are summoned, who take him away. He explains that he is the fugitive murderer and they release him to the government agency's chief, \"The Professor\"; who reveals that Kaplan was invented to distract Vandamm from the real government agent\u2014who is Eve Kendall. Thornhill agrees to help maintain her cover.\n\nAt the [[Mount Rushmore]] visitor center, Thornhill\u2014now willingly playing the role of Kaplan\u2014negotiates Vandamm's turnover of Kendall for her prosecution as a spy. When Thornhill appears to confront Kendall, she shoots him, seemingly fatally, with a handgun that is actually loaded with [[Blank (cartridge)|blanks]] and flees.\n\nAfterward, the Professor arranges for Thornhill and Kendall to meet. Thornhill discovers Kendall must depart with Vandamm and Leonard on a plane. When Thornhill tries to dissuade her from going, he is knocked unconscious and locked in a hospital room. Thornhill escapes the Professor's custody and goes to Vandamm's house to rescue Kendall.\n\n[[File:North by Northwest movie trailer screenshot (28).jpg|thumb|right|The climax at Mount Rushmore]]\nAt the house, Thornhill overhears that the sculpture holds [[Microform|microfilm]] and that Leonard discovered that the gun used by Kendall to kill Thornhill was filled with blanks. Vandamm indicates that he will kill Kendall during the flight. Thornhill warns her with a surreptitious note. Vandamm, Leonard and Kendall depart the house to board the plane. As Vandamm boards the plane, Kendall takes the sculpture and runs to the pursuing Thornhill. They flee to the top of Mount Rushmore. As they climb down the mountain they are pursued by Vandamm's thugs, including Leonard, who is fatally shot by a park ranger. Vandamm is taken into custody by the Professor.\n\nKendall meanwhile is hanging on by her fingertips on the mountain.  Thornhill reaches down to pull her up, at which point the scene cuts to him pulling her\u2014now the new Mrs. Thornhill\u2014into the upper [[Berth (sleeping)#Berths in trains|berth]] of a train. The train then enters a tunnel.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Cary Grant]] as Roger Thornhill\n* [[Eva Marie Saint]] as Eve Kendall\n* [[James Mason]] as Phillip Vandamm\n* [[Jessie Royce Landis]] as Clara Thornhill\n* [[Leo G.

Composer [[Bernard Herrmann]] had recommended that Hitchcock work with his friend [[Ernest Lehman]]. After a couple of weeks, Lehman offered to quit saying he didn't know what to do with the story. Hitchcock told him they got along great together and they would just write something else. Lehman said that he wanted to make the ultimate Hitchcock film. Hitchcock thought for a moment then said he had always wanted to do a chase across [[Mount Rushmore]]. Lehman and Hitchcock spitballed more ideas: a murder at the United Nations Headquarters; a murder at a car plant in Detroit; a final showdown in Alaska. Eventually they settled on the U.N. murder for the opening and the chase across Mount Rushmore for the climax. For the central idea, Hitchcock remembered something an American journalist had told him about spies creating a fake agent as a decoy. Perhaps their hero could be mistaken for this fictitious agent and end up on the run. They bought the idea from the journalist for $10,000.}}\n\nLehman repeated this story in the documentary ''[[Destination Hitchcock: The Making of North by Northwest]]'' that accompanied the 2001 DVD release of the film. Screenwriter [[William Goldman]] insists in ''[[Which Lie Did I Tell?]]'' (2000) that it was Lehman who created ''North by Northwest'' and that many of Hitchcock's ideas were not used. Hitchcock had the idea of the hero being stranded in the middle of nowhere, but suggested that the villains try to kill him with a [[tornado]]. Lehman responded, \"but ''they're'' trying to kill him. How are ''they'' going to work up a cyclone?\" Then, as he told an interviewer, \"I just can't tell you who said what to whom, but somewhere during that afternoon, the cyclone in the sky became the crop-duster plane.\"<ref name=\"brady202\">{{Harvnb|Brady|1981|p=202}}</ref>\n\nIn fact, Hitchcock had been working on the story for nearly nine years prior to meeting Lehman.{{cn|date=January 2020}} [[Otis Guernsey]] was the American journalist who had the idea which influenced Hitchcock, inspired by a true story during [[World War II]] when [[British Intelligence]] obtained a dead body, invented a [[Operation Mincemeat#Major William Martin, Royal Marines|fictitious officer]] who was carrying secret papers, and arranged for the body and misleading papers to be discovered by the Germans as a disinformation scheme called [[Operation Mincemeat]]. Guernsey turned his idea into a story about an American salesman who travels to the Middle East and is mistaken for a fictitious agent, becoming \"saddled with a romantic and dangerous identity\". Guernsey admitted that his treatment was full of \"corn\" and \"lacking logic\", and he urged Hitchcock to do what he liked with the story. Hitchcock bought the 60 pages for $10,000.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nHitchcock often told journalists of an idea that he had about [[Cary Grant]] hiding from the villains inside [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s nose and being given away when he sneezes. He speculated that the film could be called \"The Man in Lincoln's Nose\" (Lehman's version is that it was \"The Man on Lincoln's Nose\"<ref name=\"brady201\">{{Harvnb|Brady|1981|p=201}}</ref>) or even \"The Man who ''Sneezed'' in Lincoln's Nose\". Hitchcock sat on the idea, waiting for the right screenwriter to develop it.

Rushmore]]\nHitchcock planned the film as a change of pace after his dark romantic thriller ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' a year earlier. In his book-length interview ''Hitchcock/Truffaut'' (1967) with [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]], Hitchcock said that he wanted to do \"something fun, light-hearted, and generally free of the symbolism permeating his other movies.\"<ref>Hitchcock was not above inserting a [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] joke as the last shot, which, notably, eluded contemporary censors.</ref> Writer Ernest Lehman has also mocked those who look for symbolism in the film.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brady|1981|pp=199\u2013200}}</ref> Despite its popular appeal, the film is considered to be a masterpiece for its themes of [[deception]], [[mistaken identity]], and [[moral relativism]] in the [[Cold War]] era.\n\nThe title ''North by Northwest'' is a subject of debate. Many have seen it{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} as having been taken from a line (\"I am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw\") in ''[[Hamlet]]'', a work also concerned with the shifty nature of reality.<ref>Act II, Scene ii. Hamlet thus hints to Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, his friends, that his madness is only an act to protect himself while he gathers information on his father's murder.</ref> Hitchcock noted, in an interview with [[Peter Bogdanovich]] in 1963, \"It's a fantasy.

Lehman states that he used a working title for the film of \"In a Northwesterly Direction\", because the film's action was to begin in New York and climax in Alaska. Then the head of the story department at MGM suggested \"North by Northwest\", but this was still to be a working title. Other titles were considered, including \"The Man on Lincoln's Nose\", but \"North by Northwest\" was kept because, according to Lehman, \"We never did find a [better] title.\"<ref name=\"brady201\" /> The [[Northwest Airlines]] reference in the film plays on the title.\n\nThe film's plot involves a \"[[MacGuffin]]\", a term popularized by Hitchcock&nbsp;\u2014 a physical object that everyone in the film is chasing, but which has no deep relationship to the plot. Late in ''North by Northwest'', it emerges that the spies are attempting to smuggle [[Microform|microfilm]] containing government secrets out of the country. They have been trying to kill Thornhill, whom they believe to be the agent on their trail, \"George Kaplan\".\n\n''North by Northwest'' has been referred to as \"the first [[James Bond]] film\"<ref>{{Cite web\n| title=Hitching a ride with the Master of Suspense| url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jun/13/alfred-hitchcock-north-by-northwest| work=[[The Guardian]]| last=Patterson| first=John| date=June 13, 2009| access-date=2013-02-18}}</ref> due to its similarities with splashily colorful settings, secret agents, and an elegant, daring, wisecracking leading man opposite a sinister yet strangely charming villain.
