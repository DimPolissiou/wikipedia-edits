A [[formal language]] can be decided by a family of Boolean circuits, one circuit for each possible input length. Boolean circuits are also used as a formal model for [[combinational logic]] in digital electronics.\n\nBoolean circuits are defined in terms of the [[logic gate]]s they contain. For example, a circuit might contain [[binary function|binary]] AND and OR gates and [[unary operation|unary]] NOT gates, or be entirely described by binary [[NAND gate]]s. Each gate corresponds to some [[Boolean function]] that takes a fixed number of [[bit]]s as input and outputs a single bit.\n\nBoolean circuits provide a model for many digital components used in [[computer engineering]], including [[multiplexer]]s, [[adder (electronics)|adder]]s, and [[arithmetic logic unit]]s, but they exclude [[sequential logic]].  They are an abstraction that omits many aspects relevant to designing real digital logic circuits, such as [[metastability (electronics)|metastability]], [[fanout]], [[hazard (logic)|glitches]], [[power optimization (EDA)|power consumption]], and [[propagation delay]] variability.\n\n== Formal definition ==\nIn giving a formal definition of Boolean circuits, [[Heribert Vollmer|Vollmer]] starts by defining a basis as set ''B'' of Boolean functions, corresponding to the gates allowable in the circuit model. A Boolean circuit over a basis ''B'', with ''n'' inputs and ''m'' outputs, is then defined as a finite [[directed acyclic graph]]. Each vertex corresponds to either a basis function or one of the inputs, and there is a set of exactly ''m'' nodes which are labeled as the outputs.<ref>Vollmer 1999, p. 8.</ref> The edges must also have some ordering, to distinguish between different arguments to the same Boolean function.<ref>Vollmer 1999, p. 9.</ref>\n\nAs a special case, a [[propositional formula]] or [[Boolean expression]] is a Boolean circuit with a single output node in which every other node has [[fan-out]] of 1.

However, [[formal language]]s (the [[string (computer science)|string-based]] representations of [[decision problem]]s) contain strings of different lengths, so languages cannot be fully captured by a single circuit (in contrast to the Turing machine model, in which a language is fully described by a single Turing machine). A language is instead represented by a ''circuit family''. A circuit family is an infinite list of circuits <math>(C_0,C_1,C_2,...)</math>, where <math>C_n</math> has <math>n</math> input variables.

He joined his hometown club [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] in 2006, and went on to become captain of the side in the [[Premier League]]. Henry spent seven seasons at Wolves, making 272 appearances in all competitions.\n\nHe joined [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] in the summer of 2013 and helped them to victory in the [[2014 Football League Championship play-off Final|2014 Championship play-off Final]].

He made his [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] debut and his first start for his new club against [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]] on the opening day of the season. Henry spent most of his first season filling in at right back and playing a few games in central midfield.\n\nHe was appointed captain for the first time in December 2006 as [[Jody Craddock]] was out injured. Henry's first season for Wolves came to an end when he suffered a serious injury in the game against [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] on 3 March 2007.

He made a total of 34 appearances in his first season for Wolves, scoring three goals.\n\nIn the [[2007\u201308 Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. season|2007\u201308]] season, Henry again impressed for Wolves after holding down his position in the centre of midfield.

These goals came against [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] and two against [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]], both home and away.

He was an integral part of the team which made an impressive start to the season as Wolves were at the top of the table for numerous months with Henry captaining them. He was in the starting 11 against [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] in which Wolves went on to win the game which resulted in them gaining promotion to the [[Premier League]]. On 3 May 2009, Henry and Craddock both lifted the [[Football League Championship|Championship]] trophy at Molineux on the final day of the season after their 1\u20130 over [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]].\n\nHenry was an ever-present captain in the Wolves team in the [[2009\u201310 Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. season|2009\u201310]] season, his Premier League debut came against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] on the opening day.

F.C.|Cheltenham Town]] in 2004. He joined his hometown club [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] in 2006, and went on to become captain of the side in the [[Premier League]]. Henry spent seven seasons at Wolves, making 272 appearances in all competitions.\n\nHe joined [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] in the summer of 2013 and helped them to victory in the [[2014 Football League Championship play-off Final|2014 Championship play-off Final]]. In 2017, after four years with QPR, he was released from the club upon the expiry of his contract; he later played for [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] and [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] before retiring in 2019.\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Stoke City===\nBorn in [[Wolverhampton]], [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]],<ref name=\"Hugman2010/11\"/> Henry began his career as a youth player for [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] in 1998.

He made his [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] debut and his first start for his new club against [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Arygle]] on the opening day of the season. Henry spent most of his first season filling in at right back and playing a few games in central midfield.\n\nHe was appointed captain for the first time in December 2006 as [[Jody Craddock]] was out injured. Henry's first season for Wolves came to an end when he suffered a serious injury in the game against [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] on 3 March 2007. Henry bruised his spleen and was forced to sit out the remainder of the 2006\u201307 season, which saw him miss out on the [[Football League Championship play-offs|Championship play-offs]]. He made a total of 34 appearances in his first season for Wolves, scoring three goals.\n\nIn the [[2007\u201308 Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. season|2007\u201308]] season, Henry again impressed for Wolves after holding down his position in the centre of midfield. He went on to make a total of 42 appearances for Wolves, scoring three goals again. These goals came against [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] and two against [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]], both home and away. Henry also picked up an injury against Charlton on 29 March 2008, which saw him miss the last six games of the season.\n\nThe [[2008\u201309 Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. season|2008\u201309]] season saw Henry impress again for Wolves and he was also handed the captain's armband for the majority of the season as Jody Craddock was out injured. He was an integral part of the team which made an impressive start to the season as Wolves were at the top of the table for numerous months with Henry captaining them. He was in the starting 11 against [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] in which Wolves went on to win the game which resulted in them gaining promotion to the [[Premier League]]. On 3 May 2009, Henry and Craddock both lifted the [[Football League Championship|Championship]] trophy at Molineux on the final day of the season after their 1\u20130 over [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]].\n\nHenry was an ever-present captain in the Wolves team in the [[2009\u201310 Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. season|2009\u201310]] season, his Premier League debut came against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] on the opening day. He went on to make 34 appearances for Wolves during 2009\u201310, missing only four games, as Wolves stayed up at the end of their first season in the Premier League.\n\nDuring the [[2010\u201311 Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. season|2010\u201311]] season, Henry made 31 Premier League appearances as captain.
