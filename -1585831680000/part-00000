In 1871 he graduated from [[Williams College]]. At Williams he  was a member of the fraternity Delta Psi (aka St. Anthony Hall). Later he studied two years of theology at [[Yale Divinity School]]. After that he taught Latin and French at [[Boston Latin School]].<ref>Dates and schooling from the biographical material in ''John L. Stoddard's Lectures'', 1905.</ref> He was proud of his descent from [[Solomon Stoddard]].\n\nHe began traveling around the world in 1874 and published ''Red-Letter Days Abroad'' in 1884. He turned his experiences into a series of popular lectures delivered throughout North America. These lectures were periodically published in book form as ''John L. Stoddard's Lectures''<ref>[https://archive.org/details/johnlstoddardsl00stodgoog archive.org]</ref> and eventually numbered 10 volumes and five supplements (1897\u20131898).<ref>Book dates taken from ''American Authors and Books''.</ref> In 1901 Stoddard published a book on [[Gibraltar]].<ref name=norwood>{{cite book|last=Stoddard|first=John L.|title=Gibraltar - John L. Stoddard's Lectures|year=1901|publisher=Norwood Press|url=http://chestofbooks.com/travel/england/gibraltar/John-Stoddard-Lectures/index.html}}</ref>  The books include numerous illustrations derived from the immense catalog of photographs taken by Stoddard, and cover every subject, from art and architecture, to archaeology and natural history. The books were immensely popular in their day and many copies still survive. Later in life, Stoddard also published poetry, as well as books on religious subjects.\n\nBrought up a Protestant, Stoddard was an agnostic for more than 30 years before converting with his wife to Roman Catholicism. In 1922 he published ''Rebuilding a Lost Faith'', a famous work of apologetics which is still in print. \n[[File:Gibraltar-s-principal-street.jpg|thumb|right|The Main Street of Gibraltar, a photograph from his 1901 book<ref name=norwood/>]]\nStoddard was a proponent of the [[Restoration of the Jews to the Holy Land|restoration of the Jews to Israel]]. In Volume 2 of his ''Lectures'' he told the Jews, \u201cYou are a people without a country; there is a country without a people. Be united. Fulfill the dreams of your old poets and patriarchs. Go back, go back to the land of Abraham.\u201d<ref>Stoddard, John L. (1897). ''Lectures, Vol. 2: Constantinople. Jerusalem. Egypt.''

In 1871 he graduated from [[Williams College]]. At Williams he  was a member of the fraternity Delta Psi (aka St. Anthony Hall). Later he studied two years of theology at [[Yale Divinity School]]. After that he taught Latin and French at [[Boston Latin School]].<ref>Dates and schooling from the biographical material in ''John L. Stoddard's Lectures'', 1905.</ref> He was proud of his descent from [[Solomon Stoddard]].\n\nHe began traveling around the world in 1874 and published ''Red-Letter Days Abroad'' in 1884. He turned his experiences into a series of popular lectures delivered throughout North America. These lectures were periodically published in book form as ''John L. Stoddard's Lectures''<ref>[https://archive.org/details/johnlstoddardsl00stodgoog archive.org]</ref> and eventually numbered 10 volumes and five supplements (1897\u20131898).<ref>Book dates taken from ''American Authors and Books''.</ref> In 1901 Stoddard published a book on [[Gibraltar]].<ref name=norwood>{{cite book|last=Stoddard|first=John L.|title=Gibraltar - John L. Stoddard's Lectures|year=1901|publisher=Norwood Press|url=http://chestofbooks.com/travel/england/gibraltar/John-Stoddard-Lectures/index.html}}</ref>  The books include numerous illustrations derived from the immense catalog of photographs taken by Stoddard, and cover every subject, from art and architecture, to archaeology and natural history. The books were immensely popular in their day and many copies still survive. Later in life, Stoddard also published poetry, as well as books on religious subjects.\n\nBrought up a Protestant, Stoddard was an agnostic for more than 30 years before converting with his wife to Roman Catholicism. In 1922 he published ''Rebuilding a Lost Faith'', a famous work of apologetics which is still in print. \n[[File:Gibraltar-s-principal-street.jpg|thumb|right|The Main Street of Gibraltar, a photograph from his 1901 book<ref name=norwood/>]]\nStoddard was a proponent of the [[Restoration of the Jews to the Holy Land|restoration of the Jews to Israel]]. In Volume 2 of his ''Lectures'' he told the Jews, \u201cYou are a people without a country; there is a country without a people. Be united. Fulfill the dreams of your old poets and patriarchs. Go back, go back to the land of Abraham.\u201d<ref>Stoddard, John L. (1897). ''Lectures, Vol. 2: Constantinople. Jerusalem. Egypt.''
