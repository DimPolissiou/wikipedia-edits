He affixed Greek titles to two of his books, ''\u039a\u03b5\u03b9\u03bc\u03ae\u03bb\u03b9\u03b1 \u1f18\u03ba\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac (Historical and miscellaneous tracts'' (1662) and ''\u1f29\u03c1\u03c9\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1 Anglorum; or, a help to English history'' (1641).<ref name=OEDB>[[Oxford English Dictionary]] Bibliography: Hart-He</ref>\n\nHe was the writer of the \"Cosmographie\", an attempt to describe in meticulous detail every aspect of the known world in 1652, the geography, climate, customs, achievements, politics, and belief systems. It appears to have been the first description in print of Australia, and perhaps of California, Terra del Fuego, and other territories in the New World. He objected to the name \"America\" as it placed undue glory on [[Amerigo Vespucci]], and recommended \"Columbana\" or \"Cabotia\" as more indicative of the true discoverers, Columbus and Cabot.\n\n==Publications==\nHeylin's publications include:<ref>[[Oxford English Dictionary]]</ref>\n*Microcosmus.

In this he was criticised by [[neo-liberal]] economists such as [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Freidrich Hayek]] in what became known as the [[socialist calculation debate]].<ref name = \"between science and politics\">[[Nancy Cartwright|Cartwright Nancy]], [[J.

An example of the former is the Swedish ''Beijer International Institute of Ecological Economics.''

These ecological economists then use tools from [[mathematical economics]] as in mainstream economics, but may apply them more closely to the natural world. Whereas mainstream economists tend to be technological optimists, ecological economists are inclined to be technological sceptics. They reason that the natural world has a limited carrying capacity and that its resources may run out. Since destruction of important environmental resources could be practically irreversible and catastrophic, ecological economists are inclined to justify cautionary measures based on the [[precautionary principle]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Costanza | first1 = R | year = 1989 | title = What is ecological economics? | url = http://www.uvm.edu/giee/publications/Costanza_EE_1989.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Ecological Economics | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 1\u20137 }}</ref>\n\nThe most cogent example of how the different theories treat similar assets is [[tropical rainforest]] ecosystems, most obviously the Yasuni region of [[Ecuador]].  While this area has substantial deposits of [[bitumen]] it is also one of the most diverse ecosystems on Earth and some estimates establish it has over 200 undiscovered medical substances in its genomes - most of which would be destroyed by logging the forest or mining the bitumen.  Effectively, the [[instructional capital]] of the genomes is undervalued by analyses which view the rainforest primarily as a source of wood, oil/tar and perhaps food. Increasingly the [[carbon credit]] for leaving the extremely carbon-intensive (\"dirty\") bitumen in the ground is also valued - the government of Ecuador set a price of US$350M for an oil lease with the intent of selling it to someone committed to never exercising it at all and instead preserving the rainforest.\n\nWhile this natural capital and ecosystems services approach has proven popular amongst many it has also been contested as failing to address the underlying problems with mainstream economics, growth, market capitalism and monetary valuation of the environment.<ref>Martinez-Alier, J., 1994.

It accepts as a goal the improvement of human well-being through development, and seeks to ensure achievement of this through planning for the sustainable development of ecosystems and societies. Of course the terms development and sustainable development are far from lacking controversy. [[Richard B. Norgaard]] argues traditional economics has hi-jacked the development terminology in his book ''Development Betrayed''.<ref>Norgaard, R. B. (1994) Development Betrayed: The End of Progress and a Coevolutionary Revisioning of the Future. London: Routledge</ref>\n\nWell-being in ecological economics is also differentiated from welfare as found in mainstream economics and the 'new welfare economics' from the 1930s which informs resource and environmental economics.  This entails a limited preference utilitarian conception of value i.e., Nature is valuable to our economies, that is because people will pay for its services such as clean air, clean water, encounters with wilderness, etc.\n\nEcological economics is distinguishable from [[neoclassical economics]] primarily by its assertion that the economy is embedded within an environmental system. Ecology deals with the energy and matter transactions of life and the Earth, and the human economy is by definition contained within this system. Ecological economists argue that [[neoclassical economics]] has ignored the environment, at best considering it to be a subset of the human economy.\n\nThe neoclassical view ignores much of what the natural sciences have taught us about the contributions of nature to the creation of wealth e.g., the planetary endowment of scarce matter and energy, along with the complex and biologically diverse ecosystems that provide goods and [[ecosystem services]] directly to human communities: micro- and macro-climate regulation, water recycling, water purification, storm water regulation, waste absorption, food and medicine production, pollination, protection from solar and cosmic radiation, the view of a starry night sky, etc.\n\nThere has then been a move to regard such things as [[natural capital]] and ecosystems functions as goods and services.<ref>Daily, G.C. 1997.

Shifting dependence on fossil fuels with specific interest within just one of the above-mentioned factors easily benefits at least one other. For instance, photo voltaic (or solar) panels have a 15% efficiency when absorbing the sun's energy, but its construction demand has increased 120% within both commercial and residential properties. Additionally, this construction has led to a roughly 30% increase in work demands (Chen).\n\nThe potential for the substitution of man-made capital for natural capital is an important debate in ecological economics and the economics of sustainability.\nThere is a continuum of views among economists between the strongly neoclassical positions of [[Robert Solow]] and [[Martin Weitzman]], at one extreme and the [[Pessimism#Entropy pessimism|'entropy pessimists']], notably [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]] and [[Herman Daly]], at the other.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Ayres | first1 = R.U. | year = 2007 | title = On the practical limits of substitution | url = | journal = Ecological Economics | volume = 61 | issue = | pages = 115\u2013128 }}</ref>\n\nNeoclassical economists tend to maintain that man-made capital can, in principle, replace all types of natural capital.  This is known as the [[Strong vs Weak sustainability|weak sustainability]] view, essentially that every technology can be improved upon or replaced by innovation, and that there is a substitute for any and all scarce materials.\n\nAt the other extreme, the [[Strong vs Weak sustainability|strong sustainability]] view argues that the stock of natural resources and ecological functions are irreplaceable.  From the premises of strong sustainability, it follows that [[economic policy]] has a [[fiduciary]] responsibility to the greater ecological world, and that sustainable development must therefore take a different approach to valuing natural resources and ecological functions.\n\nRecently, Stanislav Shmelev developed a new methodology for the assessment of progress at the macro scale based on multi-criteria methods, which allows consideration of different perspectives, including strong and weak sustainability or conservationists vs industrialists and aims to search for a 'middle way' by providing a strong neo-Keynesian economic push without putting excessive pressure on the natural resources, including water or producing emissions, both directly and indirectly.<ref>Shmelev, S.E. 2012.

To be useful the energy return on energy invested (''[[EROEI]]'') has to be greater than one.  The net energy gain from production coal, oil and gas has declined over time as the easiest to produce sources have been most heavily depleted.<ref>{{cite book |title= Energy and Resource Quality: The ecology of the Economic Process |last1=Hall |first1=Charles A.S. |authorlink=\n|last2= Cleveland |first2=Cutler J.\n|last3=Kaufmann |first3=Robert\n|year=1992 |publisher= University Press of colorado |location= Niwot, Colorado |isbn=  |pages=|url= }}</ref>\n\nEcological economics generally rejects the view of [[energy economics]] that growth in the energy supply is related directly to well being, focusing instead on [[biodiversity]] and [[creativity]] - or natural capital and [[individual capital]], in the terminology sometimes adopted to describe these economically. In practice, ecological economics focuses primarily on the key issues of [[uneconomic growth]] and [[quality of life]]. Ecological economists are inclined to acknowledge that much of what is important in human well-being is not analyzable from a strictly economic standpoint and suggests an interdisciplinary approach combining social and natural sciences as a means to address this.\n\n[[Thermoeconomics]] is based on the proposition that the role of energy in [[biological evolution]] should be defined and understood through the [[second law of thermodynamics]], but also in terms of such economic criteria as [[productivity]], [[Economic efficiency|efficiency]], and especially the costs and benefits (or profitability) of the various mechanisms for capturing and utilizing available energy to build biomass and do work.<ref>[[Peter A.

Reducing human bodies to financial values is a necessary part of mainstream economics and not always in the direct terms of [[insurance]] or [[wages]].  Economics, in principle, assumes that conflict is reduced by agreeing on voluntary contractual relations and prices instead of simply fighting or coercing or tricking others into providing goods or services.  In doing so, a provider agrees to surrender time and take bodily risks and other (reputation, financial) risks.  Ecosystems are no different from other bodies economically except insofar as they are far less replaceable than typical labour or commodities.\n\nDespite these issues, many ecologists and conservation biologists are pursuing [[ecosystem valuation]].

While certain services might be very useful to us, such as [[coastal protection]] from [[hurricanes]] by [[mangrove]]s for example, others might cause financial or personal harm, such as wolves hunting [[cattle]].<ref>Mech LD. The Challenge and Opportunity of Recovering Wolf Populations. Conserv Biol. 1995 Apr;9(2):270\u20138</ref> The complexity of Eco-systems makes it challenging to weigh up the value of a given species. Wolves play a critical role in regulating prey populations; the absence of such an apex predator in the Scottish Highlands has caused the over population of deer, preventing afforestation, which increases the risk of flooding and damage to property.\n \nSecondly, allocating monetary value to nature would make its conservation reliant on markets that fluctuate. This can lead to [[devaluation]] of services that were previously considered financially beneficial. Such is the case of the bees in a forest near former [[coffee plantation]]s in Finca Santa Fe, [[Costa Rica]]. The [[pollination]] services were valued to over US$60,000 a year, but soon after the study, coffee prices dropped and the fields were replanted with pineapple.<ref>Ricketts TH, Daily GC, Ehrlich PR, Michener CD. Economic value of tropical forest to coffee production. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Aug 24;101(34):12579\u201382</ref> Pineapple does not require bees to be pollinated, so the value of their service dropped to zero.\n\nThirdly, conservation programmes for the sake of financial benefit underestimate human ingenuity to invent and replace ecosystem services by artificial means. McCauley argues that such proposals are deemed to have a short lifespan as the history of [[technology]] is about how Humanity developed [[artificial]] alternatives to nature's services and with time passing the cost of such services tend to decrease. This would also lead to the devaluation of [[ecosystem services]].\n\nLastly, it should not be assumed that conserving ecosystems is always financially beneficial as opposed to alteration. In the case of the introduction of the [[Nile perch]] to [[Lake Victoria]], the ecological consequence was decimation of native [[fauna]]. However, this same event is praised by the local communities as they gain significant financial benefits from trading the fish.\n\nMcCauley argues that, for these reasons, trying to convince decision-makers to conserve nature for [[monetary]] reasons is not the path to be followed, and instead appealing to morality is the ultimate way to campaign for the protection of nature.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Science|Environment|Ecology|Earth sciences|Systems science}}\n{{cols|colwidth=15em}}\n*[[:Category:Ecological economists|Ecological economists]] (category)\n*[[Agroecology]]\n*[[Deep ecology]]\n*[[Degrowth]]\n* [[Earth system governance]]\n*[[Earth Economics]] (policy think tank)\n*[[Eco-socialism]]\n*[[Ecofeminism]]\n*[[Ecological model of competition]]\n*[[Ecological values of mangrove]]\n*[[Ecology of contexts]]\n*[[Emergy|Emergy synthesis]]\n*[[Embodied energy]]\n*[[Embodied water]]\n*[[Energy accounting]]\n*[[Energy quality]]\n*[[Environmental economics]]\n*[[Green accounting]]\n*[[Human development theory]]\n*[[Human ecology]]\n*[[Inclusive Democracy]]\n*[[Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare]]\n*[[International Society for Ecological Economics]]\n*[[Natural capital accounting]]\n*[[Natural resource economics]]\n*[[Outline of green politics]]\n*[[Social metabolism]]\n*[[Spaceship Earth]]\n*[[Steady-state economy]]\n*[[Thermoeconomics]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Common, M. and Stagl, S. 2005.

Some are close to resource and environmental economics while others are far more heterodox in outlook. An example of the latter is the ''European Society for Ecological Economics''.  An example of the former is the Swedish ''Beijer International Institute of Ecological Economics.'' [[Clive Spash]] has argued for the classification of the ecological economics movement, and more generally work by different economic schools on the environment, into three main categories.  These are the mainstream new resource economists, the new environmental pragmatists,<ref>http://www.clivespash.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Spash_NEP_2009_EV.pdf</ref> and the more radical social ecological economists.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clivespash.org/2011_Spash_AJES_Social_Ecol_Econ.pdf |title=Spash, C.L.

These ecological economists then use tools from [[mathematical economics]] as in mainstream economics, but may apply them more closely to the natural world. Whereas mainstream economists tend to be technological optimists, ecological economists are inclined to be technological sceptics. They reason that the natural world has a limited carrying capacity and that its resources may run out. Since destruction of important environmental resources could be practically irreversible and catastrophic, ecological economists are inclined to justify cautionary measures based on the [[precautionary principle]].<ref>Costanza R. (1989). What is ecological economics? ''Ecological Economics'' '''1''':1-7. [http://www.uvm.edu/giee/publications/Costanza_EE_1989.pdf].</ref>\n\nThe most cogent example of how the different theories treat similar assets is [[tropical rainforest]] ecosystems, most obviously the Yasuni region of [[Ecuador]].  While this area has substantial deposits of [[bitumen]] it is also one of the most diverse ecosystems on Earth and some estimates establish it has over 200 undiscovered medical substances in its genomes - most of which would be destroyed by logging the forest or mining the bitumen.  Effectively, the [[instructional capital]] of the genomes is undervalued by analyses which view the rainforest primarily as a source of wood, oil/tar and perhaps food. Increasingly the [[carbon credit]] for leaving the extremely carbon-intensive (\"dirty\") bitumen in the ground is also valued - the government of Ecuador set a price of US$350M for an oil lease with the intent of selling it to someone committed to never exercising it at all and instead preserving the rainforest.\n\nWhile this natural capital and ecosystems services approach has proven popular amongst many it has also been contested as failing to address the underlying problems with mainstream economics, growth, market capitalism and monetary valuation of the environment.<ref>Martinez-Alier, J., 1994.

Once consumed, natural inputs pass out of the economy as pollution and waste. The potential of an environment to provide services and materials is referred to as an \"environment's source function\", and this function is depleted as resources are consumed or pollution contaminates the resources. The \"sink function\" describes an environment's ability to absorb and render harmless waste and pollution: when waste output exceeds the limit of the sink function, long-term damage occurs.<ref name=Harris2006>Harris J.

Food production may become a problem, as [[erosion]], an impending [[water crisis]], and [[soil salinity]] (from [[irrigation]]) reduce the productivity of agriculture.

It accepts as a goal the improvement of human well-being through development, and seeks to ensure achievement of this through planning for the sustainable development of ecosystems and societies. Of course the terms development and sustainable development are far from lacking controversy. [[Richard B. Norgaard]] argues traditional economics has hi-jacked the development terminology in his book ''Development Betrayed''.<ref>Norgaard, R. B. (1994) Development Betrayed: The End of Progress and a Coevolutionary Revisioning of the Future. London: Routledge</ref>\n\nWell-being in ecological economics is also differentiated from welfare as found in mainstream economics and the 'new welfare economics' from the 1930s which informs resource and environmental economics.  This entails a limited preference utilitarian conception of value i.e., Nature is valuable to our economies, that is because people will pay for its services such as clean air, clean water, encounters with wilderness, etc.\n\nEcological economics is distinguishable from [[neoclassical economics]] primarily by its assertion that the economy is embedded within an environmental system. Ecology deals with the energy and matter transactions of life and the Earth, and the human economy is by definition contained within this system. Ecological economists argue that [[neoclassical economics]] has ignored the environment, at best considering it to be a subset of the human economy.\n\nThe neoclassical view ignores much of what the natural sciences have taught us about the contributions of nature to the creation of wealth e.g., the planetary endowment of scarce matter and energy, along with the complex and biologically diverse ecosystems that provide goods and [[ecosystem services]] directly to human communities: micro- and macro-climate regulation, water recycling, water purification, storm water regulation, waste absorption, food and medicine production, pollination, protection from solar and cosmic radiation, the view of a starry night sky, etc.\n\nThere has then been a move to regard such things as [[natural capital]] and ecosystems functions as goods and services.<ref>Daily, G.C. 1997.

This has been referred to as ecologists 'selling out on Nature'.<ref>McCauley, D. J. (2006) Selling out on nature.

Shifting dependence on fossil fuels with specific interest within just one of the above-mentioned factors easily benefits at least one other. For instance, photo voltaic (or solar) panels have a 15% efficiency when absorbing the sun's energy, but its construction demand has increased 120% within both commercial and residential properties. Additionally, this construction has led to a roughly 30% increase in work demands (Chen).\n\nThe potential for the substitution of man-made capital for natural capital is an important debate in ecological economics and the economics of sustainability.\nThere is a continuum of views among economists between the strongly neoclassical positions of [[Robert Solow]] and [[Martin Weitzman]], at one extreme and the [[Pessimism#Entropy pessimism|'entropy pessimists']], notably [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]] and [[Herman Daly]], at the other.<ref>Ayres, R.U. 2007. On the practical limits of substitution. Ecological Economics 61: 115-128.</ref>\n\nNeoclassical economists tend to maintain that man-made capital can, in principle, replace all types of natural capital.  This is known as the [[Strong vs Weak sustainability|weak sustainability]] view, essentially that every technology can be improved upon or replaced by innovation, and that there is a substitute for any and all scarce materials.\n\nAt the other extreme, the [[Strong vs Weak sustainability|strong sustainability]] view argues that the stock of natural resources and ecological functions are irreplaceable.  From the premises of strong sustainability, it follows that [[economic policy]] has a [[fiduciary]] responsibility to the greater ecological world, and that sustainable development must therefore take a different approach to valuing natural resources and ecological functions.\n\nRecently, Stanislav Shmelev developed a new methodology for the assessment of progress at the macro scale based on multi-criteria methods, which allows consideration of different perspectives, including strong and weak sustainability or conservationists vs industrialists and aims to search for a 'middle way' by providing a strong neo-Keynesian economic push without putting excessive pressure on the natural resources, including water or producing emissions, both directly and indirectly.<ref>Shmelev, S.E. 2012.

Ecological economists are inclined to acknowledge that much of what is important in human well-being is not analyzable from a strictly economic standpoint and suggests an interdisciplinary approach combining social and natural sciences as a means to address this.\n\n[[Thermoeconomics]] is based on the proposition that the role of energy in [[biological evolution]] should be defined and understood through the [[second law of thermodynamics]], but also in terms of such economic criteria as [[productivity]], [[Economic efficiency|efficiency]], and especially the costs and benefits (or profitability) of the various mechanisms for capturing and utilizing available energy to build biomass and do work.<ref>[[Peter A.

Reducing human bodies to financial values is a necessary part of mainstream economics and not always in the direct terms of [[insurance]] or [[wages]].  Economics, in principle, assumes that conflict is reduced by agreeing on voluntary contractual relations and prices instead of simply fighting or coercing or tricking others into providing goods or services.  In doing so, a provider agrees to surrender time and take bodily risks and other (reputation, financial) risks.  Ecosystems are no different from other bodies economically except insofar as they are far less replaceable than typical labour or commodities.\n\nDespite these issues, many ecologists and conservation biologists are pursuing [[ecosystem valuation]]. [[Biodiversity]] measures in particular appear to be the most promising way to reconcile financial and ecological values, and there are many active efforts in this regard.

The field considers questions such as the growth imperative of interest-bearing debt, the nature of money, and alternative policy proposals such as alternative currencies and public banking.\n\n==Criticism==\n\nAssigning monetary value to natural resources such as [[biodiversity]], and the emergent [[ecosystem services]] is often viewed as a key process in influencing economic practices, policy, and decision-making.<ref>Mace GM. Whose conservation? Science (80- ). 2014 Sep 25;345(6204):1558\u201360.</ref><ref>Dasgupta P. Nature\u2019s role in sustaining economic development. Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci. 2010 Jan 12;365(1537):5\u201311.</ref> While this idea is becoming more and more accepted among ecologists and conservationist, some argue that it is inherently false.\n \n[[Douglas McCauley|McCauley]] argues that ecological economics and the resulting ecosystem service based conservation can be harmful.<ref>{{cite journal | last=McCauley | first=Douglas J. | title=Selling out on nature | journal=Nature | publisher=Springer Nature | volume=443 | issue=7107 | year=2006 |url=http://ibis.geog.ubc.ca/biodiversity/eflora/Selling_out_on_nature.pdf| issn=0028-0836 | doi=10.1038/443027a | pmid=16957711 | pages=27\u201328 | ref=harv| bibcode=2006Natur.443...27M }}</ref> He describes four main problems with this approach:\n\nFirstly, it seems to be assumed that all ecosystem services are financially beneficial. This is undermined by a basic characteristic of ecosystems: they do not act specifically in favour of any single species. While certain services might be very useful to us, such as [[coastal protection]] from [[hurricanes]] by [[mangrove]]s for example, others might cause financial or personal harm, such as wolves hunting [[cattle]].<ref>Mech LD. The Challenge and Opportunity of Recovering Wolf Populations. Conserv Biol. 1995 Apr;9(2):270\u20138</ref> The complexity of Eco-systems makes it challenging to weigh up the value of a given species. Wolves play a critical role in regulating prey populations; the absence of such an apex predator in the Scottish Highlands has caused the over population of deer, preventing afforestation, which increases the risk of flooding and damage to property.\n \nSecondly, allocating monetary value to nature would make its conservation reliant on markets that fluctuate. This can lead to [[devaluation]] of services that were previously considered financially beneficial. Such is the case of the bees in a forest near former [[coffee plantation]]s in Finca Santa Fe, [[Costa Rica]]. The [[pollination]] services were valued to over US$60,000 a year, but soon after the study, coffee prices dropped and the fields were replanted with pineapple.<ref>Ricketts TH, Daily GC, Ehrlich PR, Michener CD. Economic value of tropical forest to coffee production. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Aug 24;101(34):12579\u201382</ref> Pineapple does not require bees to be pollinated, so the value of their service dropped to zero.\n\nThirdly, conservation programmes for the sake of financial benefit underestimate human ingenuity to invent and replace ecosystem services by artificial means. McCauley argues that such proposals are deemed to have a short lifespan as the history of [[technology]] is about how Humanity developed [[artificial]] alternatives to nature's services and with time passing the cost of such services tend to decrease. This would also lead to the devaluation of [[ecosystem services]].\n\nLastly, it should not be assumed that conserving ecosystems is always financially beneficial as opposed to alteration. In the case of the introduction of the [[Nile perch]] to [[Lake Victoria]], the ecological consequence was decimation of native [[fauna]]. However, this same event is praised by the local communities as they gain significant financial benefits from trading the fish.\n\nMcCauley argues that, for these reasons, trying to convince decision-makers to conserve nature for [[monetary]] reasons is not the path to be followed, and instead appealing to morality is the ultimate way to campaign for the protection of nature.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Science|Environment|Ecology|Earth sciences|Systems science}}\n{{cols|colwidth=15em}}\n*[[:Category:Ecological economists|Ecological economists]] (category)\n*[[Agroecology]]\n*[[Deep ecology]]\n*[[Degrowth]]\n* [[Earth system governance]]\n*[[Earth Economics]] (policy think tank)\n*[[Eco-socialism]]\n*[[Ecofeminism]]\n*[[Ecological model of competition]]\n*[[Ecological values of mangrove]]\n*[[Ecology of contexts]]\n*[[Emergy|Emergy synthesis]]\n*[[Embodied energy]]\n*[[Embodied water]]\n*[[Energy accounting]]\n*[[Energy quality]]\n*[[Environmental economics]]\n*[[Green accounting]]\n*[[Human development theory]]\n*[[Human ecology]]\n*[[Inclusive Democracy]]\n*[[Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare]]\n*[[International Society for Ecological Economics]]\n*[[Natural capital accounting]]\n*[[Natural resource economics]]\n*[[Outline of green politics]]\n*[[Social metabolism]]\n*[[Spaceship Earth]]\n*[[Steady-state economy]]\n*[[Thermoeconomics]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Common, M. and Stagl, S. 2005.
