She is the daughter of [[Satan|Lucifer]] and [[Lilith]], and is one of the few demons born in Hell. Upset by the yearly cleanse in which a number of demons are destroyed by the Exterminators, she and her girlfriend<ref name=\"geekiary\"/><ref name=\"go\"/><ref name=\"Belatina\"/> Vaggie seek to open a hotel that allows for the rehabilitation of sinners with the hope that they can receive forgiveness and enter heaven. Her bold plans are often laughed at by most of the demons in hell. She is shown to be very naive and optimistic but cares deeply for her people. She has a love for [[musical theatre]], preferring expressing herself in singing and dance, and has had an ex-boyfriend in the past named Seviathan Von Eldritch.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n*'''{{vanchor|Vagatha \"Vaggie\"}}''' (voiced by Monica Franco) is Charlie's girlfriend<ref name=\"geekiary\"/><ref name=\"go\"/><ref name=\"Belatina\">{{Cite web|url=https://belatina.com/hazbin-hotel-pilot-review/|title=A Salvadoran-American Artist\u2019s Conception of Hell|last=Liberman|first=Dr Esther|date=2019-12-09|website=BeLatina|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-26}}</ref> and the Manager<ref name=\"We want to help everyone get to know our cast!\"/> of the Hazbin Hotel. She is highly supportive of Charlie and has a quick temper. Often acting as the more level-headed and rational one, she struggles to keep the hotel's image up. She is quite annoyed by Angel Dust's trouble-making and doesn't trust Alastor at all due to his notorious reputation. She is often shown defending Charlie with a large spear similar to that of the Exterminators. She can also summon various knives and daggers at will. There is little information about her past life, but it is known that she entered Hell in 2014.<ref name=\"We want to help everyone get to know our cast!\"/>\n*'''{{vanchor|Anthony \"Angel Dust\"}}''' (voiced by Michael Kovach) is a four-armed [[Androgyny|androgynous]] [[Pornographic film actor|adult-film star]], and the first volunteer for Charlie's rehabilitation program. He doesn't seem to take Charlie's cause seriously, stating to only be interested in the [[renting|rent]]-free accommodation, much to Vaggie's anger, and tends to get into mischief behind their backs. In his mortal life, Angel was born to a [[Organized crime|crime family]],<ref name=\"We want to help everyone get to know our cast!\"/> most of which reside in hell with him.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} Angel struggled with drug addiction{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} which ultimately led to his death in 1947.<ref name=\"We want to help everyone get to know our cast!\"/> His stage name is based on the street name for the drug [[Phencyclidine]], which he still regularly uses in Hell.\n*'''{{vanchor|Alastor}}''', also known as the \"'''Radio Demon'''\" (voiced by Edward Bosco; singing voice by Gabriel C. Brown), is an eccentric demon Overlord. Known to be extremely powerful and is capable of rivaling some of Hell's most ancient demons, despite having been a [[wiktionary:mortal|mortal]] [[human]] in life. Upon his arrival in hell he built up a terrifying reputation seemingly overnight. Often keeping to a calm and gentlemanly demeanor, he prefers to always keep a smile on his face and shares Charlie's love of music and dance. His voice sounds like a vintage 1920s radio complete with static, sound effects including a [[laugh track]], and theme music. He offers his services to Charlie in order to help her maintain her goal of running the hotel, but only for the amusement of watching other demons fail in the process. Charlie reluctantly allows his services as long as he doesn't do anything to jeopardize the hotel, and for as long as he chooses without making one of his [[Deal with the Devil|infamous pacts]], and by also invoking her status as the heir to the throne. He nevertheless, provides a staff, and protects Charlie's business from outside threats. It's stated that in his past life, Alastor was an actual [[Radio broadcasting|radio announcer]] who lived a double life as a [[serial killer]] in the [[Deep South]].<ref name=\"Get to know some of the more devious of the cast!\"/> Having lived to see the [[Great Depression|Stock market crash]], he died in 1933.<ref name=\"Get to know some of the more devious of the cast!\">{{cite tweet |user= HazbinHotel | number= 992879031182704640 | date= 6 May 2018 | accessdate=13 February 2020 | title= Get to know some of the more devious of the cast!\ud83d\ude08}}</ref>\n* '''Niffty''' (voiced by Michelle Marie) is a small, fast demonic [[cyclops]] from the 1950s,{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} who's obsessed with cleanliness. She is summoned by Alastor to serve as the hotel housekeeper.

He is summoned by Alastor to serve as the receptionist and bartender at the hotel. He seems to have a long history with Alastor, and is often displeased with being dragged into another one of his schemes.\n\n===Supporting characters===\n* '''Sir Pentious''' (voiced by Will Stamper), an [[England|English]] anthropomorphic [[cobra]] from the [[Victorian era]]. His goal is to take over Hell, but he often fails to do so.

Vox is stated to be one of the major villains in the series, and has an opposite personality with Alastor.\n* '''Valentino''', is one of the major Overlords of Hell and runs the porn studios.

She appears briefly in Charlie's song \"''Inside of Every Demon Is a Rainbow''\", where she is called a \"loser\". Portraits in the hotel show the Mange and Von Eldrich family as close friends/associates.\n* '''Mimzy''', is a small short and cheerful demon from the [[1920s|1920's]], who is one of Alastor's associates and a good friend to Niffty. She is a singer and club owner who will be a frequent associate at the hotel.\n* '''Baxter''', is a short, aquatic [[anthropomorphic]] fish demon, who is stated to be a frequent associate at the hotel. He is shown to have an obsession with science and has a personality that's described by Vivienne as \"screechy, neurotic, and an all-around \"mess\" wanting nothing to do with anyone and would rather be alone doing mad science\". Baxter died in the [[1910s|1910's]].\n* '''Crymini''', is a small, delinquent [[anthropomorphic]] [[Hellhound|dog demon]], who is stated to be a frequent associate at the hotel.

Like Charlie, their appearance isn't fearsome and could almost pass as \"human\". Visual nods to their character designs are present; such as Lucifer's staff being a clear reference to [[Adam and Eve#The Fall|his tempting of Eve]]. Vivienne has described Lucifer as a [[Willy Wonka|Willy Wonka-like]] character,{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} and if he and Alastor met, they would be good friends due to their matching personalities.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} Lilith is shown in portraits and posters to be a famous [[Theatre|stage performer]],{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} explaining Charlie's love of music and dance.

After a brief argument on their way to the hotel, they're visited by Alastor, a notorious demon overlord who seeks to help Charlie with the hotel. Despite his shady claims that he only wishes to provide this \"charity\" for his own entertainment, Charlie allows his help for as long as he wishes, and to not do anything that would ruin her goals. Alastor accepts and provides her with a staff to help run the hotel, he defeats Sir Pentious when he attacks the hotel seeking revenge, and changes the name from Happy to Hazbin Hotel after inviting everyone back inside to have [[jambalaya]].<hr>Songs: \"I'm Always Chasing Rainbows\" ''(Charlie)'', \"Inside of Every Demon Is a Rainbow\" ''(Charlie)'', \"Alastor's Reprise\" ''(Alastor)''\n| LineColor       = 3CB371\n}}\n<!---\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = \n| Title           = \n| RTitle          = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       =\n| Aux2            =\n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ProdCode        = \n| Viewers         = \n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 3CB371\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = \n| Title           = \n| RTitle          = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| Aux2            = \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ProdCode        = \n| Viewers         = \n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 3CB371\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = \n| Title           = \n| RTitle          = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| Aux2            = \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ProdCode        = \n| Viewers         = \n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 3CB371\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = \n| Title           = \n| RTitle          = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| Aux2            = \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ProdCode        = \n| Viewers         = \n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 3CB371\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = \n| Title           = \n| RTitle          = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| Aux2            = \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ProdCode        = \n| Viewers         = \n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 3CB371\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = \n| Title           = \n| RTitle          = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| Aux2            = \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ProdCode        = \n| Viewers         = \n| LineColor       = 3CB371\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   =\n| Title           = \n| RTitle          = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| Aux2            = \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ProdCode        = \n| Viewers         = \n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 3CB371\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = \n| Title           = \n| RTitle          = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| Aux2            = \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ProdCode        = \n| Viewers         = \n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 3CB371\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = \n| Title           = \n| RTitle          = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| Aux2            = \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ProdCode        = \n| Viewers         = \n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 3CB371\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = \n| Title           = \n| RTitle          = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| Aux2            = \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ProdCode        = \n| Viewers         = \n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 3CB371\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = \n| Title           = \n| RTitle          = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| Aux2            = \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ProdCode        = \n| Viewers         = \n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 3CB371\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = \n| Title           = \n| RTitle          = \n| DirectedBy      = \n| WrittenBy       = \n| Aux2            = \n| OriginalAirDate = \n| ProdCode        = \n| Viewers         = \n| ShortSummary    = \n| LineColor       = 3CB371\n}}\n===Season 2===--->\n}}\n\n==Other media==\n===Comic===\nVivziepop announced a prequel comic focusing on the characters prior to the events of the series.<ref name=\"7 MILLION?

With the help of her devoted manager and girlfriend Vaggie (Monica Franco) and their first patron, [[pornographic film actor]] Angel Dust (Michael Kovach), she's determined to make her dream become a reality.

Her bold plans are often laughed at by most of the demons in hell. She is shown to be very naive and optimistic but cares deeply for her people. She has a love for [[musical theatre]], preferring expressing herself in singing and dance, and has had an ex-boyfriend in the past named Seviathan Von Eldritch.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n*'''{{vanchor|Vagatha \"Vaggie\"}}''' (voiced by Monica Franco) is Charlie's girlfriend<ref name=\"geekiary\"/><ref name=\"go\"/><ref name=\"Belatina\">{{Cite web|url=https://belatina.com/hazbin-hotel-pilot-review/|title=A Salvadoran-American Artist\u2019s Conception of Hell|last=Liberman|first=Dr Esther|date=2019-12-09|website=BeLatina|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-26}}</ref> and the Manager<ref name=\"We want to help everyone get to know our cast!\"/> of the Hazbin Hotel. She is highly supportive of Charlie and has a quick temper. Often acting as the more level-headed and rational one, she struggles to keep the hotel's image up. She is quite annoyed by Angel Dust's trouble-making and doesn't trust Alastor at all due to his notorious reputation. She is often shown defending Charlie with a large spear similar to that of the Exterminators. She can also summon various knives and daggers at will. There is little information about her past life, but it is known that she entered Hell in 2014.<ref name=\"We want to help everyone get to know our cast!\"/>\n*'''{{vanchor|Anthony \"Angel Dust\"}}''' (voiced by Michael Kovach) is a four-armed [[Androgyny|androgynous]] [[Pornographic film actor|adult-film star]], and the first volunteer for Charlie's rehabilitation program.

Brown), is an eccentric demon Overlord. Known to be extremely powerful and is capable of rivaling some of Hell's most ancient demons, despite having been a [[wiktionary:mortal|mortal]] [[human]] in life. Upon his arrival in hell he built up a terrifying reputation seemingly overnight. Often keeping to a calm and gentlemanly demeanor, he prefers to always keep a smile on his face and shares Charlie's love of music and dance. His voice sounds like a vintage 1920s radio complete with static, sound effects including a [[laugh track]], and theme music. He offers his services to Charlie in order to help her maintain her goal of running the hotel, but only for the amusement of watching other demons fail in the process. Charlie reluctantly allows his services as long as he doesn't do anything to jeopardize the hotel, and for as long as he chooses without making one of his [[Deal with the Devil|infamous pacts]], and by also invoking her status as the heir to the throne. He nevertheless, provides a staff, and protects Charlie's business from outside threats. It's stated that in his past life, Alastor was an actual [[Radio broadcasting|radio announcer]] who lived a double life as a [[serial killer]] in the [[Deep South]].<ref name=\"Get to know some of the more devious of the cast!\"/> Having lived to see the [[Great Depression|Stock market crash]], he died in 1933.<ref name=\"Get to know some of the more devious of the cast!\">{{cite tweet |user= HazbinHotel | number= 992879031182704640 | date= 6 May 2018 | accessdate=13 February 2020 | title= Get to know some of the more devious of the cast!\ud83d\ude08}}</ref>\n* '''Niffty''' (voiced by Michelle Marie) is a small, fast demonic [[cyclops]] from the 1950s,{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} who's obsessed with cleanliness.

He seems to have a long history with Alastor, and is often displeased with being dragged into another one of his schemes.\n\n===Supporting characters===\n* '''Sir Pentious''' (voiced by Will Stamper), an [[England|English]] anthropomorphic [[cobra]] from the [[Victorian era]].

Vivienne has described Lucifer as a [[Willy Wonka|Willy Wonka-like]] character,{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} and if he and Alastor met, they would be good friends due to their matching personalities.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} Lilith is shown in portraits and posters to be a famous [[Theatre|stage performer]],{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} explaining Charlie's love of music and dance.

In Mithraism, festivals had a deep linkage with the Sun's light. The Iranian festivals such as [[Mehrgan]] ([[autumnal equinox]]), [[Tirgan]], and the eve of [[Yalda|Chelle ye Zemestan]] ([[winter solstice]]) also had an origin in the Sun god ([[Surya]]). Among other ideas, Zoroastrianism is the first [[monotheism|monotheistic]] religion that emphasizes broad concepts such as the corresponding work of good and evil in the world, and the connection of humans to nature. Zoroastrian practices were dominant for much of the history of ancient Iran. In Zoroastrianism, the seven most important Zoroastrian festivals are the six [[Gahambars|Gahambar]] festivals and Nowruz, which occurs at the [[spring equinox (Northern Hemisphere)|spring equinox]]. According to [[Mary Boyce]],<ref>[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/festivals-i Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica, \"Festivals: Zoroastrian\" Boyce, Mary] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111074500/http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/festivals-i |date=January 11, 2012 }}</ref> \"It seems a reasonable surmise that Nowruz, the holiest of them all, with deep doctrinal significance, was founded by [[Zoroaster]] himself\"; although there is no clear date of origin.<ref>Boyce, M.

In Mithraism, festivals had a deep linkage with the Sun's light. The Iranian festivals such as [[Mehrgan]] ([[autumnal equinox]]), [[Tirgan]], and the eve of [[Yalda|Chelle ye Zemestan]] ([[winter solstice]]) also had an origin in the Sun god ([[Surya]]). Among other ideas, Zoroastrianism is the first [[monotheism|monotheistic]] religion that emphasizes broad concepts such as the corresponding work of good and evil in the world, and the connection of humans to nature. Zoroastrian practices were dominant for much of the history of ancient Iran. In Zoroastrianism, the seven most important Zoroastrian festivals are the six [[Gahambars|Gahambar]] festivals and Nowruz, which occurs at the [[spring equinox (Northern Hemisphere)|spring equinox]]. According to [[Mary Boyce]],<ref>[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/festivals-i Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica, \"Festivals: Zoroastrian\" Boyce, Mary] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111074500/http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/festivals-i |date=January 11, 2012 }}</ref> \"It seems a reasonable surmise that Nowruz, the holiest of them all, with deep doctrinal significance, was founded by [[Zoroaster]] himself\"; although there is no clear date of origin.<ref>Boyce, M.
