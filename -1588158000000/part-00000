{"title_page": "Home front during World War I", "text_new": "The '''home front during world war 1''' covers the domestic, economic, social and political histories of countries involved in [[World War I|that conflict]]. It covers the mobilization of armed forces and war supplies, but does not include the military history. For nonmilitary interactions among the major players see [[Diplomatic history of World War I]].\n\nAbout 10.9 million combatants and seven million civilians [[World War I casualties|died during the entire war]], including many weakened by years of malnutrition; they fell in the worldwide [[1918 flu pandemic|Spanish Flu pandemic]], which struck late in 1918, just as the war was ending.\n\nThe [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] had much more potential wealth that they could spend on the war. One estimate (using 1913 US dollars), is that the Allies spent $147 billion on the war and the [[Central Powers]] only $61 billion. Among the Allies, Britain and its Empire spent $47 billion and the US$27 billion; among the Central Powers, Germany spent $45 billion.<ref>H.E. Fisk, ''The Inter-Allied Debts'' (1924) pp 13 & 325 reprinted in Horst Menderhausen, ''The Economics of War'' (1943 edition), appendix table II</ref>\n\nTotal war demanded total mobilization of all the nation's resources for a common goal. Manpower had to be channeled into the front lines (all the powers except the United States and Britain had large trained reserves designed for just that). Behind the lines labor power had to be redirected away from less necessary activities that were luxuries during a total war. In particular, vast munitions industries had to be built up to provide shells, guns, warships, uniforms, airplanes, and a hundred other weapons, both old and new. Agriculture had to be mobilized as well, to provide food for both civilians and for soldiers (many of whom had been farmers and needed to be replaced by old men, boys and women) and for horses to move supplies. Transportation in general was a challenge, especially when Britain and Germany each tried to intercept merchant ships headed for the enemy. Finance was a special challenge. Germany financed the Central Powers. Britain financed the Allies until 1916, when it ran out of money and had to borrow from the United States. The US took over the financing of the Allies in 1917 with loans that it insisted be repaid after the war.  The victorious Allies looked to defeated Germany in 1919 to pay \"reparations\" that would cover some of their costs. Above all, it was essential to conduct the mobilization in such a way that the short term confidence of the people was maintained, the long-term power of the political establishment was upheld, and the long-term economic health of the nation was preserved.<ref>Hardach, ''First World War: 1914\u20131918'' (1981)</ref> For more details on economics see [[Economic history of World War I]].\n\nWorld War I had a profound impact on woman suffrage across the belligerents. Women played a major role on the homefronts and many countries recognized their sacrifices with the vote during or shortly after the war, including the United States, Britain, Canada (except Quebec), Denmark, Austria, the Netherlands, Germany, Russia, Sweden and Ireland. France almost did so but stopped short.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Palm | first = Trineke | title = Embedded in social cleavages: an explanation of the variation in timing of women's suffrage | journal = [[Scandinavian Political Studies]] | volume = 36 | issue = 1 | pages = 1\u201322 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9477.2012.00294.x | date = March 2013 | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\n==Financial costs==\n{{Further|Economic history of World War I}}\nThe total direct cost of war, for all participants including those not listed here, was about $80 billion (in 1913 US dollars) since $1 billion in 1913 = about $15 billion in 2017 US dollars the total cost comes to about $2 trillion in 2017 dollars.

Lewis argue:\n:To prosecute industrial war required the mobilisation of economic resources for the mass production of weapons and munitions, which necessarily entitled fundamental changes in the relationship between the state (the procurer), business (the provider), labour (the key productive input), and the military (the consumer). In this context, the industrial battlefields of France and Flanders intertwined with the home front that produced the materials to sustain a war over four long and bloody years.<ref>Roger Lloyd-Jones and M. J. Lewis, ''Arming the Western Front: War, Business and the State in Britain, 1900\u20131920'' (Routledge, 2016), p 1.</ref>\n\nEconomic sacrifices were made, however, in the name of defeating the enemy.<ref>Stephen Broadberry and Peter Howlett, \"The United Kingdom during World War I: business as usual?\" in Broadberry and Harrison, eds. ''The Economics of World War I'' (2005) ch 7</ref> In 1915 Liberal politician [[David Lloyd George]] took charge of the newly created Ministry of Munitions. He dramatically increased the output of artillery shells\u2014the main weapon actually used in battle. In 1916 he became secretary for war. Prime Minister H. H. Asquith was a disappointment; he formed a coalition government in 1915 but it was also ineffective. Asquith was replaced by Lloyd George in late 1916. He had a strong hand in the managing of every affair, making many decisions himself. Historians credit Lloyd George with providing the driving energy and organisation that won the War.<ref>A.J.P.

He also saw the famous literary pessimism of the 1920s as misplaced, for there were major positive long-term consequences of the war. He pointed to new job opportunities and self-consciousness among workers that quickly built up the Labour Party, to the coming of partial woman suffrage, and to an acceleration of social reform and state control of the British economy. He found a decline of deference toward the aristocracy and established authority in general, and a weakening among youth of traditional restraints on individual moral behavior. Marwick concluded that class differentials softened, national cohesion increased, and British society became more equal.<ref>Arthur Marwick, ''The Deluge: British Society and the First World War'' (1965)</ref> During the conflict, the various elements of the British Left created the War Emergency Workers' National Committee, which played a crucial role in supporting the most vulnerable people on the Home Front during the war, and in ensuring the British Labour remained united in the years after the Armistice.<ref>David Swift,  \"The War Emergency: Workers' National Committee.\" ''History Workshop Journal'' 81 (2016): 84-105.

There emerged a radical movement called \"[[Red Clydeside]]\" led by militant trades unionists.  Formerly a Liberal Party stronghold, the industrial districts switched to Labour by 1922, with a base among the Irish Catholic working class districts.  Women were especially active solidarity on housing issues. However, the \"Reds\" operated within the Labour Party and had little influence in Parliament; the mood changed to passive despair by the late 1920s.<ref>Iain McLean, ''The Legend of Red Clydeside'' (1983)</ref>\n\n===Politics===\n{{See also|David Lloyd George}}\n[[David Lloyd George]] became prime minister in December 1916 and immediately transformed the British war effort, taking firm control of both military and domestic policy.<ref>John Grigg, ''Lloyd George: War Leader 1916\u20131918'' (2002) vol 4 pp&nbsp;1\u201330</ref><ref>A.

Taylor, ''English History, 1914\u20131945'' (1965) pp&nbsp;100\u2013106</ref> The Germans, having moved troops from the Eastern front and retrained them in new tactics, now had more soldiers on the Western Front than the Allies. Germany launched a full scale [[Spring Offensive]] ([[Operation Michael]]), starting March 21 against the British and French lines, with the hope of victory on the battlefield before the American troops arrived in numbers. The Allied armies fell back 40 miles in confusion, and facing defeat, London realized it needed more troops to fight a mobile war. Lloyd George found a half million soldiers and rushed them to France, asked American President Woodrow Wilson for immediate help, and agreed to the appointment of French General Foch as commander-in-chief on the Western Front so that Allied forces could be coordinated to handle the German offensive.<ref>John Grigg, ''Lloyd George: War Leader 1916\u20131918'' (2002) vol 4 pp&nbsp;478\u201383</ref>\n\nDespite strong warnings it was a bad idea, the War Cabinet [[Conscription Crisis of 1918|decided to impose conscription on Ireland]]. The main reason was that labour in Britain demanded it as the price for cutting back on exemptions for certain workers. Labour wanted the principle established that no one was exempt, but it did not demand that the draft actually take place in Ireland. The proposal was enacted but never enforced. The Catholic bishops for the first time entered the fray and called for open resistance to a draft. Many Irish Catholics and nationalists moved into the intransigent [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] movement. This proved a decisive moment, marking the end of Irish willingness to stay inside the UK.<ref>Alan J. Ward, \"Lloyd George and the 1918 Irish Conscription Crisis,\" ''Historical Journal'' (1974) 17#1 pp.&nbsp;107\u2013129 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2638335 in JSTOR]</ref><ref>Grigg, ''Lloyd George'' vol 4 pp&nbsp;465\u201388</ref>\n\nWhen on May 7, 1918, a senior army general on active duty, Major-General Sir [[Frederick Barton Maurice|Frederick Maurice]] went public with allegations that Lloyd George had lied to Parliament on military matters, [[Maurice Debate|a crisis was at hand]]. The German spring offensive had made unexpected major gains, and a scapegoat was needed. Asquith, the Liberal leader in the House, took up the allegations and attacked Lloyd George (also a Liberal), which further split the Liberal Party. While Asquith's presentation was poorly done, Lloyd George vigorously defended his position, treating the debate as a vote of confidence. He won over the House with a powerful refutation of Maurice's allegations. The main results were to strengthen Lloyd George, weaken Asquith, end public criticism of overall strategy, and strengthen civilian control of the military.<ref>John Gooch, \"The Maurice Debate 1918,\" ''Journal of Contemporary History'' (1968) 3#4 pp.&nbsp;211\u2013228 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/259859 in JSTOR]</ref><ref>John Grigg, ''Lloyd George: War leader, 1916\u20131918'' (London: Penguin, 2002), pp&nbsp;489\u2013512</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the German offensive stalled. By summer the Americans were sending 10,000 fresh men a day to the Western Front, a more rapid response made possible by leaving their equipment behind and using British and French munitions. The German army had used up its last reserves and was steadily shrinking in number and weakening in resolve. Victory came on November 11, 1918.<ref>A. J. P.

Pugh (1974) argues that enfranchising soldiers primarily and women secondarily was decided by senior politicians in 1916. In the absence of major women's groups demanding for equal suffrage, the government's conference recommended limited, age-restricted women's suffrage. The [[suffragettes]] had been weakened, Pugh argues, by repeated failures before 1914 and by the disorganizing effects of war mobilization; therefore they quietly accepted these restrictions, which were approved in 1918 by a majority of the War Ministry and each political party in Parliament.<ref>Martin D. Pugh, \"Politicians and the Woman's Vote 1914\u20131918,\" ''History,'' (1974), Vol. 59 Issue 197, pp&nbsp;358\u2013374</ref> More generally, Searle (2004) argues that the British debate was essentially over by the 1890s, and that granting the suffrage in 1918 was mostly a byproduct of giving the vote to male soldiers. Women in Britain finally achieved suffrage on the same terms as men in 1928.<ref>G.R. Searle, ''A New England?

Arguing that Canada had become a true nation on the battlefields of Europe, Borden demanded and received a separate seat for Canada at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference of 1919]]. Canada's military and civilian participation in the First World War strengthened a sense of British-Canadian nationhood among the Anglophones (English speakers). The Francophones (French speakers) supported the war at first, but pulled back and stood aloof after 1915 because of language disputes at home. Heroic memories centered around the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]] were the unified Canadian corps captured Vimy ridge, a position that the French and British armies had failed to capture and \"[[Canada's Hundred Days]]\" battles of 1918 which saw the Canadian corps of 100,000 defeat one fourth of the German Army on the Western Front.<ref>Jacqueline Hucker, \"'Battle and Burial': Recapturing the Cultural Meaning of Canada's National Memorial on Vimy Ridge,\" ''Public Historian,'' (Feb 2009) 31#1 pp&nbsp;89\u2013109</ref>\n\n===Australia===\n[[File:SLNSW 75769 To my Dear Friend on Active Service postcard with Kookaburra and text.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|An Australian [[Kookaburra]] active service postcard]]\n[[Billy Hughes]], prime minister from October 1915, expanded the government's role in the economy, while dealing with intense debates over the issue of conscription.<ref>Kosmas Tsokhas, \"The Forgotten Economy and Australia's Involvement in the Great War,\" ''Diplomacy & Statecraft'' (1993) 4#2 331-357</ref>\n\nFrom a population of five million, 417,000 men enlisted; 330,000 went overseas to fight during the First World War.

He says the war turned a peaceful nation into \"one that was violent, aggressive, angst- and conflict-ridden, torn apart by invisible front lines of sectarian division, ethnic conflict and socio-economic and political upheaval.\" The nation was fearful of enemy aliens\u2014especially Germans, regardless of how closely they identified with Australia.

Racist hostility was high toward nonwhites, including Pacific Islanders, Chinese and Aborigines.

London provided assurances that it would underwrite a large amount of the war risk insurance for shipping in order to allow trade amongst the Commonwealth nations to continue. London imposed controls so that no exports would wind up in German hands. The British government protected prices by buying Australian products, even though the shortage of shipping meant that there was no chance that they would ever receive them.<ref>Scott, ''Australia During the War'' (1941) p.&nbsp;516\u201318, 539.</ref>\n\nOn the whole, Australian commerce was expanded due to the war, although the cost of the war was quite considerable and the Australian government had to borrow considerably from overseas to fund the war effort. In terms of value, Australian exports rose almost 45 per cent, while the number of Australians employed in manufacturing industries increased over 11 per cent. Iron mining and steel manufacture grew enormously.<ref>Russel Ward, ''A nation for a continent: The history of Australia, 1901\u20131975''  (1977) p 110</ref> Inflation became a factor as the prices of [[consumer goods]] went up, while the cost of exports was deliberately kept lower than market value in an effort to prevent further inflationary pressures worldwide. As a result, the cost of living for many average Australians was increased.<ref>Scott, ''Australia During the War'' (1941) pp. 549, 563</ref>\n\nThe trade union movement, already powerful, grew rapidly, although the movement was split on the political question of conscription. It expelled the politicians, such as Hughes, who favoured conscription (which was never passed into law).<ref>Stuart Macintyre, ''The Oxford History of Australia: Volume 4: 1901\u201342, the Succeeding Age'' (1987) pp&nbsp;163\u201375</ref> The government sought to stabilize wages, much to the anger of unionists. the average weekly wage during the war was increased by between 8 and 12 per cent, it was not enough to keep up with inflation. Angry workers launched a wave of strikes against both the wage freeze and the conscription proposal. Nevertheless, the result was very disruptive and it has been estimated that between 1914 and 1918 there were 1,945 industrial disputes, resulting in 8,533,061 working days being lost and a \u00a34,785,607 deficit in wages.<ref>Scott, ''Australia During the War'' (1941) pp.&nbsp;663\u201365</ref><ref>Russel Ward, ''A nation for a continent: The history of Australia, 1901\u20131975''  (1977) p&nbsp;110\u201311</ref>\n\nOverall, the war had a significantly negative impact on the Australia economy. Real aggregate [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP) declined by 9.5 percent over the period 1914 to 1920, while the mobilization of personnel resulted in a six percent decline in civilian employment. Meanwhile, although population growth continued during the war years, it was only half that of the prewar rate. Per capita incomes also declined sharply, failing by 16 percent.<ref>Ian W. McLean, ''Why Australia Prospered: The Shifting Sources of Economic Growth'' (2013), pp. 147\u2013148.</ref>\n\n===New Zealand===\nThe country remained an enthusiastic supporter of the Empire, enlisting 124,211 men and sending 100,444 to fight in [[World War I]] (see [[New Zealand Expeditionary Force]]). Over 18,000 died in service. Conscription was introduced in mid 1916 and by the end of the war near 1 in four members of the NZEF was a conscript.<ref>Steven Loveridge, ''Calls to Arms: New Zealand Society and Commitment to the Great War'' (Wellington: Victoria University Press, 2014) p.26</ref> As in Australia, involvement in the Gallipoli campaign became an iconic touchstone in New Zealand memory of the war and was commonly connected to imaginings of collective identity.\n\nThe war divided the labour movement with numerous elements taking up roles in the war effort while others alleged the war was an imperial venture against the interests of the working class.  Labour MPs frequently acted as critics of government policy during the war and opposition to conscription saw the modern Labour Party formed in 1916. Maori tribes that had been close to the government sent their young men to volunteer.  The mobilisation of women for war work/service was relatively slight compared to more industrialised countries. Though some 640 women served as nurses with 500 going overseas.<ref>Gwen Parsons, \"The New Zealand Home Front during World War One and World War Two,\" ''History Compass'' (2013) 11#6 pp&nbsp;419\u2013428</ref>\n\nNew Zealand forces captured [[Western Samoa]] from Germany in the early stages of the war, and New Zealand administered the country until Samoan Independence in 1962.

The British elements strongly supported the war and comprised the great majority of the 146,000 white soldiers. Nasson says, \"for many enthusiastic English-speaking Union recruits, going to war was anticipated as an exciting adventure, egged on by the itch of making a manly mark upon a heroic cause.\"<ref>Nasson, ''Springboks on the Somme'' ch 8</ref> Likewise the Indian element (led by [[Mahatma Gandhi]]), generally supported the war effort. Afrikaners were split, with some like Prime Minister [[Louis Botha]] and General [[Jan Smuts]] taking a prominent leadership role in the British war effort. Their pro-British position was rejected by many rural Afrikaners who favoured Germany and who launched the [[Maritz Rebellion]], a small-scale open revolt against the government. The trade union movement was divided. Many urban blacks supported the war, expecting it would raise their status in society. Others said it was not relevant to the struggle for their rights. The Coloured element was generally supportive and many served in a Coloured Corps in East Africa and France, also hoping to better their lot after the war. Those blacks and Coloureds who supported the war were embittered when the postwar era saw no easing of white domination and restrictive conditions.<ref>Bill Nasson, \"A Great Divide: Popular Responses to the Great War in South Africa,\" ''War & Society'' (1994) 12#1 pp&nbsp;47\u201364</ref>\n\n===India===\nThe British controlled India (including modern Pakistan and Bangladesh) either directly through the [[British Raj]] or indirectly through [[Princely state|local princes]]. The colonial government of India supported the war enthusiastically, and enlarged the British Indian army by a factor of 500% to 1.4 million men. It sent 550,000 overseas, with 200,000 going as labourers to the Western Front and the rest to the Middle East theatre. Only a few hundred were allowed to become officers, but there were some 100,000 casualties. The main fighting of the latter group was in Iraq, where large numbers were killed and captured in the initial stages of the [[Mesopotamian campaign]], most infamously during the [[Siege of Kut]].<ref>Tucker,  ''European Powers,'' pp&nbsp;353\u20134</ref> The Indian contingent was entirely funded by the Indian taxpayers (who had no vote and no voice in the matter).\n\nAlthough Germany and the Ottoman Empire tried to incite anti-British subversion with the help of Indian freedom fighters, such as [[Rash Bihari Bose]] or [[Bagha Jatin]], they had virtually no success, apart from a localized [[1915 Singapore Mutiny]],<ref>Hew Strachan, ''The First World War'' (2001) 1:791-814</ref> which was a part of the [[Ghadar Mutiny|Gadar conspiracy]]. The small Indian industrial base expanded dramatically to provide most of the supplies and munitions for the Middle East theatre.<ref>David Stevenson, ''With Our Backs to the Wall'' (2011) pp&nbsp;257\u20138, 381</ref> Indian nationalists became well organized for the first time during the war, and were stunned when they received little in the way of self-government in the aftermath of victory.\n\nIn 1918, India experienced an influenza epidemic and severe food shortages.\n\n==Belgium==\n{{main|Belgium in World War I|Rape of Belgium}}\nNearly all of Belgium was occupied by the Germans, but the government and army escaped and fought the war on a narrow slice of the Western Front. The German invaders treated any resistance\u2014such as sabotaging rail lines\u2014as illegal and immoral, and shot the offenders and burned buildings in retaliation. The German army executed over 6,500 French and Belgian civilians between August and November 1914, usually in near-random large-scale shootings of civilians ordered by junior German officers. The German Army destroyed 15,000-20,000 buildings\u2014most famously the university library at Louvain\u2014and generated a refugee wave of over a million people. Over half the German regiments in Belgium were involved in major incidents.<ref>John Horne and Alan Kramer, ''German Atrocities, 1914: A History of Denial'' (Yale U.P. 2001) ch 1-2, esp. p. 76</ref> Thousands of workers were shipped to Germany to work in factories. British propaganda dramatizing the [[Rape of Belgium]] attracted much attention in the US, while Berlin said it was legal and necessary because of the threat of \"franc-tireurs\" (guerrillas) like those in France in 1870.<ref>Horne and Kramer, ''German Atrocities, 1914: A History of Denial'' ch 3-4 show there were no \"franc-tireurs\"  in Belgium.</ref> The British and French magnified the reports and disseminated them at home and in the US, where they played a major role in dissolving support for Germany.<ref>Horne and Kramer, ''German Atrocities, 1914: A History of Denial'' ch 5-8</ref>\n\nThe Germans left Belgium stripped and barren. They shipped machinery to Germany while destroying factories.<ref>E.H. Kossmann. ''The Low Countries'' (1978), p&nbsp;523\u201335</ref> After the atrocities of the first few weeks, German civil servants took control and were generally correct, albeit strict and severe. There was no violent resistance movement, but there was a large-scale spontaneous passive resistance of a refusal to work for the benefit of German victory. Belgium was heavily industrialized; while farms operated and small shops stayed open, most large establishments shut down or drastically reduced their output.

New resources were opened, especially copper mining in Katanga province. The British-owned Union Miniere company dominated the copper industry; it used a direct rail line to the sea at Beira. The war caused a heavy demand for copper, production soared from 997 tons in 1911 to 27,000 tons in 1917, then fell off to 19,000 tons in 1920. Smelters operated at Lubumbashi; before the war copper was sold to Germany; the British purchased all the wartime output, with the revenues going to the Belgian government in exile. Diamond and gold mining expanded during the war. The British firm of Lever Bros. greatly expanded the palm oil business during the war, and there was an increased output of cocoa, rice and cotton.

The soldiers were protesting not just the futility of frontal assaults in the face of German machine guns but also degraded conditions at the front lines and at home, especially infrequent leaves, poor food, the use of African and Asian colonials on the home front, and concerns about the welfare of their wives and children.<ref>Leonard V.

Labor shortages were in part alleviated by the use of volunteer and forced labor from the colonies.\n\nThe war damages amounted to about 113% of the GDP of 1913, chiefly the destruction of productive capital and housing. The national debt rose from 66% of GDP in 1913 to 170% in 1919, reflecting the heavy use of bond issues to pay for the war.  Inflation was severe, with the franc losing over half its value against the British pound.<ref>Paul Beaudry and Franck Portier, \"The French depression in the 1930s.\" ''Review of Economic Dynamics''(2002) 5#1 pp: 73-99.</ref>\n\nThe World War ended a golden era for the press. Their younger staff members were drafted and male replacements could not be found (women were not considered). Rail transportation was rationed and less paper and ink came in, and fewer copies could be shipped out. Inflation raised the price of newsprint, which was always in short supply. The cover price went up, circulation fell and many of the 242 dailies published outside Paris closed down. The government set up the Interministerial Press Commission to closely supervise newspapers.  A separate agency imposed tight censorship that led to blank spaces where news reports or editorials were disallowed. The dailies sometimes were limited to only two pages instead of the usual four, leading one satirical paper to try to report the war news in the same spirit:\n: War News.

Control of the Baltic Sea by the German fleet, and of the Black Sea by combined German and Ottoman forces prevented Russia from importing supplies or exporting goods. By the middle of 1915 the impact of the war was demoralizing. Food and fuel supplies grew scarce, war casualties kept climbing and inflation was mounting. Strikes increased among low-paid factory workers, and the peasants, who wanted land reforms, were restless. Meanwhile, elite distrust of the incompetent decision making at the highest levels was deepened when a semiliterate mystic, [[Grigory Rasputin]], gained enormous influence over the Tsar and his wife until he was assassinated. Major strikes broke out early in 1917 and the army sided with the strikers in the [[February Revolution]]. The tsar abdicated. The liberal reformer [[Alexander Kerensky]] came to power in July, but in the [[October Revolution]] Lenin and the Bolsheviks took control. In early 1918 they signed the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] that made Germany dominant in Eastern Europe, while Russia plunged into years of civil war.<ref>John M.

Public opinion in Italy was sharply divided, with Catholics and socialists calling for peace. However nationalists saw their opportunity to gain their \"irredenta\" \u2013 that is, the border regions that were controlled by Austria. The nationalists won out, and in April 1915, the Italian government secretly agreed to the [[London Pact]] in which Britain and France promised that if Italy would declare war on Austria, it would receive its territorial rewards. The Italian army of 875,000 men was poorly led and lacked heavy artillery and machine guns. The industrial base was too small to provide adequate amounts of modern equipment, and the old-fashioned rural base did not produce much of a food surplus.<ref>Francesco Galassi and Mark Harrison, \"Italy at war, 1915\u20131918,\" in Broadberry and Harrison, eds.

At Fiat the workforce grew from 4,000 to 40,000. Inflation doubled the cost of living. Industrial wages kept pace but not wages for farm workers. Discontent was high in rural areas since so many men were taken for service, industrial jobs were unavailable, wages grew slowly and inflation was just as bad.<ref>Tucker, ''European Powers in the First World War,'' p&nbsp;375\u201376</ref>\n\nItaly blocked serious peace negotiations, staying in the war primarily to gain new territory. The [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of St. Germain]] awarded the victorious Italian nation the Southern half of the [[County of Tyrol]], [[Trieste]], [[Istria]], and the city of [[Zadar]]. Italy did not receive other territories promised by the Pact of London, so this victory was considered \"[[Mutilated victory|mutilated]]\".

The [[Sedition Act of 1918]] criminalized any expression of opinion that used \"disloyal, profane, scurrilous or abusive language\" about the US government, flag or armed forces.

He demanded Germany depose the Kaiser and accept his terms, the [[Fourteen Points]]. Wilson dominated the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|1919 Paris Peace Conference]] but Germany was treated harshly by the Allies in the [[Treaty of Versailles]] (1919) as Wilson put all his hopes in the new [[League of Nations]].

Bulgaria was ill-prepared for a long war; the absence of so many soldiers sharply reduced agricultural output. Much of its best food was smuggled out to feed lucrative black-markets elsewhere. By 1918 the soldiers were not only short of basic equipment like boots, but they were being fed mostly corn bread with a little meat. Germany increasingly took control, and Bulgarian relations with its ally the Ottoman Empire soured. The Allied offensive in September 1918 destroyed the remnants of Bulgarian military power and civilian morale. Troops mutinied and peasants [[Aleksandar Stamboliyski|revolted]], demanding peace. By that month's end Bulgaria signed an armistice, giving up its conquests and its military hardware. [[Ferdinand I of Bulgaria|The Bulgarian Czar]] abdicated and Bulgaria's war ended.

Greece served as a staging base for large numbers of French, Serbian and other Allied units. By war's end the Greek army numbered 300,000 and had about 5,000 casualties.

Around 175,000 Chinese workers volunteered for well-paid positions in the [[Chinese Labour Corps|labor battalions]]  that served the Allies behind the lines in France,  and Africa and on supply ships.

It covers the mobilization of armed forces and war supplies, but does not include the military history. For nonmilitary interactions among the major players see [[Diplomatic history of World War I]].\n\nAbout 10.9 million combatants and seven million civilians [[World War I casualties|died during the entire war]], including many weakened by years of malnutrition; they fell in the worldwide [[1918 flu pandemic|Spanish Flu pandemic]], which struck late in 1918, just as the war was ending.\n\nThe [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] had much more potential wealth that they could spend on the war. One estimate (using 1913 US dollars), is that the Allies spent $147 billion on the war and the [[Central Powers]] only $61 billion. Among the Allies, Britain and its Empire spent $47 billion and the US$27 billion; among the Central Powers, Germany spent $45 billion.<ref>H.E. Fisk, ''The Inter-Allied Debts'' (1924) pp 13 & 325 reprinted in Horst Menderhausen, ''The Economics of War'' (1943 edition), appendix table II</ref>\n\nTotal war demanded total mobilization of all the nation's resources for a common goal. Manpower had to be channeled into the front lines (all the powers except the United States and Britain had large trained reserves designed for just that). Behind the lines labor power had to be redirected away from less necessary activities that were luxuries during a total war. In particular, vast munitions industries had to be built up to provide shells, guns, warships, uniforms, airplanes, and a hundred other weapons, both old and new. Agriculture had to be mobilized as well, to provide food for both civilians and for soldiers (many of whom had been farmers and needed to be replaced by old men, boys and women) and for horses to move supplies. Transportation in general was a challenge, especially when Britain and Germany each tried to intercept merchant ships headed for the enemy. Finance was a special challenge. Germany financed the Central Powers. Britain financed the Allies until 1916, when it ran out of money and had to borrow from the United States. The US took over the financing of the Allies in 1917 with loans that it insisted be repaid after the war.  The victorious Allies looked to defeated Germany in 1919 to pay \"reparations\" that would cover some of their costs. Above all, it was essential to conduct the mobilization in such a way that the short term confidence of the people was maintained, the long-term power of the political establishment was upheld, and the long-term economic health of the nation was preserved.<ref>Hardach, ''First World War: 1914\u20131918'' (1981)</ref> For more details on economics see [[Economic history of World War I]].\n\nWorld War I had a profound impact on woman suffrage across the belligerents. Women played a major role on the homefronts and many countries recognized their sacrifices with the vote during or shortly after the war, including the United States, Britain, Canada (except Quebec), Denmark, Austria, the Netherlands, Germany, Russia, Sweden and Ireland. France almost did so but stopped short.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Palm | first = Trineke | title = Embedded in social cleavages: an explanation of the variation in timing of women's suffrage | journal = [[Scandinavian Political Studies]] | volume = 36 | issue = 1 | pages = 1\u201322 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9477.2012.00294.x | date = March 2013 | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\n==Financial costs==\n{{Further|Economic history of World War I}}\nThe total direct cost of war, for all participants including those not listed here, was about $80 billion (in 1913 US dollars) since $1 billion in 1913 = about $15 billion in 2017 US dollars the total cost comes to about $2 trillion in 2017 dollars.

Lewis argue:\n:To prosecute industrial war required the mobilisation of economic resources for the mass production of weapons and munitions, which necessarily entitled fundamental changes in the relationship between the state (the procurer), business (the provider), labour (the key productive input), and the military (the consumer). In this context, the industrial battlefields of France and Flanders intertwined with the home front that produced the materials to sustain a war over four long and bloody years.<ref>Roger Lloyd-Jones and M. J. Lewis, ''Arming the Western Front: War, Business and the State in Britain, 1900\u20131920'' (Routledge, 2016), p 1.</ref>\n\nEconomic sacrifices were made, however, in the name of defeating the enemy.<ref>Stephen Broadberry and Peter Howlett, \"The United Kingdom during World War I: business as usual?\" in Broadberry and Harrison, eds. ''The Economics of World War I'' (2005) ch 7</ref> In 1915 Liberal politician [[David Lloyd George]] took charge of the newly created Ministry of Munitions. He dramatically increased the output of artillery shells\u2014the main weapon actually used in battle. In 1916 he became secretary for war. Prime Minister H. H. Asquith was a disappointment; he formed a coalition government in 1915 but it was also ineffective. Asquith was replaced by Lloyd George in late 1916. He had a strong hand in the managing of every affair, making many decisions himself. Historians credit Lloyd George with providing the driving energy and organisation that won the War.<ref>A.J.P.

Lloyd George cut a deal with the trades unions\u2014they approved the dilution (since it would be temporary) and threw their organizations into the war effort.<ref>Beckett (2007), pp. 341, 455</ref>\n\nHistorian [[Arthur Marwick]] saw a radical transformation of British society, a deluge that swept away many old attitudes and brought in a more equalitarian society. He also saw the famous literary pessimism of the 1920s as misplaced, for there were major positive long-term consequences of the war. He pointed to new job opportunities and self-consciousness among workers that quickly built up the Labour Party, to the coming of partial woman suffrage, and to an acceleration of social reform and state control of the British economy. He found a decline of deference toward the aristocracy and established authority in general, and a weakening among youth of traditional restraints on individual moral behavior. Marwick concluded that class differentials softened, national cohesion increased, and British society became more equal.<ref>Arthur Marwick, ''The Deluge: British Society and the First World War'' (1965)</ref> During the conflict, the various elements of the British Left created the War Emergency Workers' National Committee, which played a crucial role in supporting the most vulnerable people on the Home Front during the war, and in ensuring the British Labour remained united in the years after the Armistice.<ref>David Swift,  \"The War Emergency: Workers' National Committee.\" ''History Workshop Journal'' 81 (2016): 84-105.

There emerged a radical movement called \"[[Red Clydeside]]\" led by militant trades unionists.  Formerly a Liberal Party stronghold, the industrial districts switched to Labour by 1922, with a base among the Irish Catholic working class districts.  Women were especially active solidarity on housing issues. However, the \"Reds\" operated within the Labour Party and had little influence in Parliament; the mood changed to passive despair by the late 1920s.<ref>Iain McLean, ''The Legend of Red Clydeside'' (1983)</ref>\n\n===Politics===\n{{See also|David Lloyd George}}\n[[David Lloyd George]] became prime minister in December 1916 and immediately transformed the British war effort, taking firm control of both military and domestic policy.<ref>John Grigg, ''Lloyd George: War Leader 1916\u20131918'' (2002) vol 4 pp&nbsp;1\u201330</ref><ref>A.

Taylor, ''English History, 1914\u20131945'' (1965) pp&nbsp;100\u2013106</ref> The Germans, having moved troops from the Eastern front and retrained them in new tactics, now had more soldiers on the Western Front than the Allies. Germany launched a full scale [[Spring Offensive]] ([[Operation Michael]]), starting March 21 against the British and French lines, with the hope of victory on the battlefield before the American troops arrived in numbers. The Allied armies fell back 40 miles in confusion, and facing defeat, London realized it needed more troops to fight a mobile war. Lloyd George found a half million soldiers and rushed them to France, asked American President Woodrow Wilson for immediate help, and agreed to the appointment of French General Foch as commander-in-chief on the Western Front so that Allied forces could be coordinated to handle the German offensive.<ref>John Grigg, ''Lloyd George: War Leader 1916\u20131918'' (2002) vol 4 pp&nbsp;478\u201383</ref>\n\nDespite strong warnings it was a bad idea, the War Cabinet [[Conscription Crisis of 1918|decided to impose conscription on Ireland]]. The main reason was that labour in Britain demanded it as the price for cutting back on exemptions for certain workers. Labour wanted the principle established that no one was exempt, but it did not demand that the draft actually take place in Ireland. The proposal was enacted but never enforced. The Catholic bishops for the first time entered the fray and called for open resistance to a draft. Many Irish Catholics and nationalists moved into the intransigent [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] movement. This proved a decisive moment, marking the end of Irish willingness to stay inside the UK.<ref>Alan J. Ward, \"Lloyd George and the 1918 Irish Conscription Crisis,\" ''Historical Journal'' (1974) 17#1 pp.&nbsp;107\u2013129 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2638335 in JSTOR]</ref><ref>Grigg, ''Lloyd George'' vol 4 pp&nbsp;465\u201388</ref>\n\nWhen on May 7, 1918, a senior army general on active duty, Major-General Sir [[Frederick Barton Maurice|Frederick Maurice]] went public with allegations that Lloyd George had lied to Parliament on military matters, [[Maurice Debate|a crisis was at hand]]. The German spring offensive had made unexpected major gains, and a scapegoat was needed. Asquith, the Liberal leader in the House, took up the allegations and attacked Lloyd George (also a Liberal), which further split the Liberal Party. While Asquith's presentation was poorly done, Lloyd George vigorously defended his position, treating the debate as a vote of confidence. He won over the House with a powerful refutation of Maurice's allegations. The main results were to strengthen Lloyd George, weaken Asquith, end public criticism of overall strategy, and strengthen civilian control of the military.<ref>John Gooch, \"The Maurice Debate 1918,\" ''Journal of Contemporary History'' (1968) 3#4 pp.&nbsp;211\u2013228 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/259859 in JSTOR]</ref><ref>John Grigg, ''Lloyd George: War leader, 1916\u20131918'' (London: Penguin, 2002), pp&nbsp;489\u2013512</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the German offensive stalled. By summer the Americans were sending 10,000 fresh men a day to the Western Front, a more rapid response made possible by leaving their equipment behind and using British and French munitions. The German army had used up its last reserves and was steadily shrinking in number and weakening in resolve. Victory came on November 11, 1918.<ref>A. J. P.

Pugh (1974) argues that enfranchising soldiers primarily and women secondarily was decided by senior politicians in 1916. In the absence of major women's groups demanding for equal suffrage, the government's conference recommended limited, age-restricted women's suffrage. The [[suffragettes]] had been weakened, Pugh argues, by repeated failures before 1914 and by the disorganizing effects of war mobilization; therefore they quietly accepted these restrictions, which were approved in 1918 by a majority of the War Ministry and each political party in Parliament.<ref>Martin D.

Women in Britain finally achieved suffrage on the same terms as men in 1928.<ref>G.R. Searle, ''A New England?

Arguing that Canada had become a true nation on the battlefields of Europe, Borden demanded and received a separate seat for Canada at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference of 1919]]. Canada's military and civilian participation in the First World War strengthened a sense of British-Canadian nationhood among the Anglophones (English speakers). The Francophones (French speakers) supported the war at first, but pulled back and stood aloof after 1915 because of language disputes at home. Heroic memories centered around the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]] were the unified Canadian corps captured Vimy ridge, a position that the French and British armies had failed to capture and \"[[Canada's Hundred Days]]\" battles of 1918 which saw the Canadian corps of 100,000 defeat one fourth of the German Army on the Western Front.<ref>Jacqueline Hucker, \"'Battle and Burial': Recapturing the Cultural Meaning of Canada's National Memorial on Vimy Ridge,\" ''Public Historian,'' (Feb 2009) 31#1 pp&nbsp;89\u2013109</ref>\n\n===Australia===\n[[File:SLNSW 75769 To my Dear Friend on Active Service postcard with Kookaburra and text.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|An Australian [[Kookaburra]] active service postcard]]\n[[Billy Hughes]], prime minister from October 1915, expanded the government's role in the economy, while dealing with intense debates over the issue of conscription.<ref>Kosmas Tsokhas, \"The Forgotten Economy and Australia's Involvement in the Great War,\" ''Diplomacy & Statecraft'' (1993) 4#2 331-357</ref>\n\nFrom a population of five million, 417,000 men enlisted; 330,000 went overseas to fight during the First World War.

He says the war turned a peaceful nation into \"one that was violent, aggressive, angst- and conflict-ridden, torn apart by invisible front lines of sectarian division, ethnic conflict and socio-economic and political upheaval.\" The nation was fearful of enemy aliens\u2014especially Germans, regardless of how closely they identified with Australia.

London provided assurances that it would underwrite a large amount of the war risk insurance for shipping in order to allow trade amongst the Commonwealth nations to continue. London imposed controls so that no exports would wind up in German hands. The British government protected prices by buying Australian products, even though the shortage of shipping meant that there was no chance that they would ever receive them.<ref>Scott, ''Australia During the War'' (1941) p.&nbsp;516\u201318, 539.</ref>\n\nOn the whole, Australian commerce was expanded due to the war, although the cost of the war was quite considerable and the Australian government had to borrow considerably from overseas to fund the war effort. In terms of value, Australian exports rose almost 45 per cent, while the number of Australians employed in manufacturing industries increased over 11 per cent. Iron mining and steel manufacture grew enormously.<ref>Russel Ward, ''A nation for a continent: The history of Australia, 1901\u20131975''  (1977) p 110</ref> Inflation became a factor as the prices of [[consumer goods]] went up, while the cost of exports was deliberately kept lower than market value in an effort to prevent further inflationary pressures worldwide. As a result, the cost of living for many average Australians was increased.<ref>Scott, ''Australia During the War'' (1941) pp. 549, 563</ref>\n\nThe trade union movement, already powerful, grew rapidly, although the movement was split on the political question of conscription. It expelled the politicians, such as Hughes, who favoured conscription (which was never passed into law).<ref>Stuart Macintyre, ''The Oxford History of Australia: Volume 4: 1901\u201342, the Succeeding Age'' (1987) pp&nbsp;163\u201375</ref> The government sought to stabilize wages, much to the anger of unionists. the average weekly wage during the war was increased by between 8 and 12 per cent, it was not enough to keep up with inflation. Angry workers launched a wave of strikes against both the wage freeze and the conscription proposal. Nevertheless, the result was very disruptive and it has been estimated that between 1914 and 1918 there were 1,945 industrial disputes, resulting in 8,533,061 working days being lost and a \u00a34,785,607 deficit in wages.<ref>Scott, ''Australia During the War'' (1941) pp.&nbsp;663\u201365</ref><ref>Russel Ward, ''A nation for a continent: The history of Australia, 1901\u20131975''  (1977) p&nbsp;110\u201311</ref>\n\nOverall, the war had a significantly negative impact on the Australia economy. Real aggregate [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP) declined by 9.5 percent over the period 1914 to 1920, while the mobilization of personnel resulted in a six percent decline in civilian employment. Meanwhile, although population growth continued during the war years, it was only half that of the prewar rate. Per capita incomes also declined sharply, failing by 16 percent.<ref>Ian W. McLean, ''Why Australia Prospered: The Shifting Sources of Economic Growth'' (2013), pp. 147\u2013148.</ref>\n\n===New Zealand===\nThe country remained an enthusiastic supporter of the Empire, enlisting 124,211 men and sending 100,444 to fight in [[World War I]] (see [[New Zealand Expeditionary Force]]). Over 18,000 died in service. Conscription was introduced in mid 1916 and by the end of the war near 1 in four members of the NZEF was a conscript.<ref>Steven Loveridge, ''Calls to Arms: New Zealand Society and Commitment to the Great War'' (Wellington: Victoria University Press, 2014) p.26</ref> As in Australia, involvement in the Gallipoli campaign became an iconic touchstone in New Zealand memory of the war and was commonly connected to imaginings of collective identity.\n\nThe war divided the labour movement with numerous elements taking up roles in the war effort while others alleged the war was an imperial venture against the interests of the working class.  Labour MPs frequently acted as critics of government policy during the war and opposition to conscription saw the modern Labour Party formed in 1916. Maori tribes that had been close to the government sent their young men to volunteer.  The mobilisation of women for war work/service was relatively slight compared to more industrialised countries. Though some 640 women served as nurses with 500 going overseas.<ref>Gwen Parsons, \"The New Zealand Home Front during World War One and World War Two,\" ''History Compass'' (2013) 11#6 pp&nbsp;419\u2013428</ref>\n\nNew Zealand forces captured [[Western Samoa]] from Germany in the early stages of the war, and New Zealand administered the country until Samoan Independence in 1962.

The British elements strongly supported the war and comprised the great majority of the 146,000 white soldiers. Nasson says, \"for many enthusiastic English-speaking Union recruits, going to war was anticipated as an exciting adventure, egged on by the itch of making a manly mark upon a heroic cause.\"<ref>Nasson, ''Springboks on the Somme'' ch 8</ref> Likewise the Indian element (led by [[Mahatma Gandhi]]), generally supported the war effort. Afrikaners were split, with some like Prime Minister [[Louis Botha]] and General [[Jan Smuts]] taking a prominent leadership role in the British war effort. Their pro-British position was rejected by many rural Afrikaners who favoured Germany and who launched the [[Maritz Rebellion]], a small-scale open revolt against the government. The trade union movement was divided. Many urban blacks supported the war, expecting it would raise their status in society. Others said it was not relevant to the struggle for their rights. The Coloured element was generally supportive and many served in a Coloured Corps in East Africa and France, also hoping to better their lot after the war. Those blacks and Coloureds who supported the war were embittered when the postwar era saw no easing of white domination and restrictive conditions.<ref>Bill Nasson, \"A Great Divide: Popular Responses to the Great War in South Africa,\" ''War & Society'' (1994) 12#1 pp&nbsp;47\u201364</ref>\n\n===India===\nThe British controlled India (including modern Pakistan and Bangladesh) either directly through the [[British Raj]] or indirectly through [[Princely state|local princes]]. The colonial government of India supported the war enthusiastically, and enlarged the British Indian army by a factor of 500% to 1.4 million men. It sent 550,000 overseas, with 200,000 going as labourers to the Western Front and the rest to the Middle East theatre. Only a few hundred were allowed to become officers, but there were some 100,000 casualties. The main fighting of the latter group was in Iraq, where large numbers were killed and captured in the initial stages of the [[Mesopotamian campaign]], most infamously during the [[Siege of Kut]].<ref>Tucker,  ''European Powers,'' pp&nbsp;353\u20134</ref> The Indian contingent was entirely funded by the Indian taxpayers (who had no vote and no voice in the matter).\n\nAlthough Germany and the Ottoman Empire tried to incite anti-British subversion with the help of Indian freedom fighters, such as [[Rash Bihari Bose]] or [[Bagha Jatin]], they had virtually no success, apart from a localized [[1915 Singapore Mutiny]],<ref>Hew Strachan, ''The First World War'' (2001) 1:791-814</ref> which was a part of the [[Ghadar Mutiny|Gadar conspiracy]]. The small Indian industrial base expanded dramatically to provide most of the supplies and munitions for the Middle East theatre.<ref>David Stevenson, ''With Our Backs to the Wall'' (2011) pp&nbsp;257\u20138, 381</ref> Indian nationalists became well organized for the first time during the war, and were stunned when they received little in the way of self-government in the aftermath of victory.\n\nIn 1918, India experienced an influenza epidemic and severe food shortages.\n\n==Belgium==\n{{main|Belgium in World War I|Rape of Belgium}}\nNearly all of Belgium was occupied by the Germans, but the government and army escaped and fought the war on a narrow slice of the Western Front. The German invaders treated any resistance\u2014such as sabotaging rail lines\u2014as illegal and immoral, and shot the offenders and burned buildings in retaliation. The German army executed over 6,500 French and Belgian civilians between August and November 1914, usually in near-random large-scale shootings of civilians ordered by junior German officers. The German Army destroyed 15,000-20,000 buildings\u2014most famously the university library at Louvain\u2014and generated a refugee wave of over a million people. Over half the German regiments in Belgium were involved in major incidents.<ref>John Horne and Alan Kramer, ''German Atrocities, 1914: A History of Denial'' (Yale U.P. 2001) ch 1-2, esp. p. 76</ref> Thousands of workers were shipped to Germany to work in factories. British propaganda dramatizing the [[Rape of Belgium]] attracted much attention in the US, while Berlin said it was legal and necessary because of the threat of \"franc-tireurs\" (guerrillas) like those in France in 1870.<ref>Horne and Kramer, ''German Atrocities, 1914: A History of Denial'' ch 3-4 show there were no \"franc-tireurs\"  in Belgium.</ref> The British and French magnified the reports and disseminated them at home and in the US, where they played a major role in dissolving support for Germany.<ref>Horne and Kramer, ''German Atrocities, 1914: A History of Denial'' ch 5-8</ref>\n\nThe Germans left Belgium stripped and barren. They shipped machinery to Germany while destroying factories.<ref>E.H. Kossmann. ''The Low Countries'' (1978), p&nbsp;523\u201335</ref> After the atrocities of the first few weeks, German civil servants took control and were generally correct, albeit strict and severe. There was no violent resistance movement, but there was a large-scale spontaneous passive resistance of a refusal to work for the benefit of German victory. Belgium was heavily industrialized; while farms operated and small shops stayed open, most large establishments shut down or drastically reduced their output. The faculty closed the universities; publishers shut down most newspapers. Most Belgians \"turned the four war years into a long and extremely dull vacation, says Kiossmann.<ref>Kossmann, p 525</ref>\n\nNeutrals led by the United States set up the Commission for Relief in Belgium, headed by American engineer [[Herbert Hoover]].

The Socialists\u2014mostly poor workers\u2014benefited more than the more middle class Catholics and Liberals.\n\n===Belgian Congo===\nRubber had long been the main export; production levels held up but its importance fell from 77% of exports (by value) to only 15%. New resources were opened, especially copper mining in Katanga province. The British-owned Union Miniere company dominated the copper industry; it used a direct rail line to the sea at Beira. The war caused a heavy demand for copper, production soared from 997 tons in 1911 to 27,000 tons in 1917, then fell off to 19,000 tons in 1920. Smelters operated at Lubumbashi; before the war copper was sold to Germany; the British purchased all the wartime output, with the revenues going to the Belgian government in exile. Diamond and gold mining expanded during the war. The British firm of Lever Bros. greatly expanded the palm oil business during the war, and there was an increased output of cocoa, rice and cotton.

Labor shortages were in part alleviated by the use of volunteer and forced labor from the colonies.\n\nThe war damages amounted to about 113% of the GDP of 1913, chiefly the destruction of productive capital and housing. The national debt rose from 66% of GDP in 1913 to 170% in 1919, reflecting the heavy use of bond issues to pay for the war.  Inflation was severe, with the franc losing over half its value against the British pound.<ref>Paul Beaudry and Franck Portier, \"The French depression in the 1930s.\" ''Review of Economic Dynamics''(2002) 5#1 pp: 73-99.</ref>\n\nThe World War ended a golden era for the press. Their younger staff members were drafted and male replacements could not be found (women were not considered). Rail transportation was rationed and less paper and ink came in, and fewer copies could be shipped out. Inflation raised the price of newsprint, which was always in short supply. The cover price went up, circulation fell and many of the 242 dailies published outside Paris closed down. The government set up the Interministerial Press Commission to closely supervise newspapers.  A separate agency imposed tight censorship that led to blank spaces where news reports or editorials were disallowed. The dailies sometimes were limited to only two pages instead of the usual four, leading one satirical paper to try to report the war news in the same spirit:\n: War News.

Control of the Baltic Sea by the German fleet, and of the Black Sea by combined German and Ottoman forces prevented Russia from importing supplies or exporting goods. By the middle of 1915 the impact of the war was demoralizing. Food and fuel supplies grew scarce, war casualties kept climbing and inflation was mounting. Strikes increased among low-paid factory workers, and the peasants, who wanted land reforms, were restless. Meanwhile, elite distrust of the incompetent decision making at the highest levels was deepened when a semiliterate mystic, [[Grigory Rasputin]], gained enormous influence over the Tsar and his wife until he was assassinated. Major strikes broke out early in 1917 and the army sided with the strikers in the [[February Revolution]]. The tsar abdicated. The liberal reformer [[Alexander Kerensky]] came to power in July, but in the [[October Revolution]] Lenin and the Bolsheviks took control.

Public opinion in Italy was sharply divided, with Catholics and socialists calling for peace. However nationalists saw their opportunity to gain their \"irredenta\" \u2013 that is, the border regions that were controlled by Austria. The nationalists won out, and in April 1915, the Italian government secretly agreed to the [[London Pact]] in which Britain and France promised that if Italy would declare war on Austria, it would receive its territorial rewards. The Italian army of 875,000 men was poorly led and lacked heavy artillery and machine guns. The industrial base was too small to provide adequate amounts of modern equipment, and the old-fashioned rural base did not produce much of a food surplus.<ref>Francesco Galassi and Mark Harrison, \"Italy at war, 1915\u20131918,\" in Broadberry and Harrison, eds.

At Fiat the workforce grew from 4,000 to 40,000. Inflation doubled the cost of living. Industrial wages kept pace but not wages for farm workers. Discontent was high in rural areas since so many men were taken for service, industrial jobs were unavailable, wages grew slowly and inflation was just as bad.<ref>Tucker, ''European Powers in the First World War,'' p&nbsp;375\u201376</ref>\n\nItaly blocked serious peace negotiations, staying in the war primarily to gain new territory. The [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of St. Germain]] awarded the victorious Italian nation the Southern half of the [[County of Tyrol]], [[Trieste]], [[Istria]], and the city of [[Zadar]]. Italy did not receive other territories promised by the Pact of London, so this victory was considered \"[[Mutilated victory|mutilated]]\".

The [[Sedition Act of 1918]] criminalized any expression of opinion that used \"disloyal, profane, scurrilous or abusive language\" about the US government, flag or armed forces.

He demanded Germany depose the Kaiser and accept his terms, the [[Fourteen Points]]. Wilson dominated the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|1919 Paris Peace Conference]] but Germany was treated harshly by the Allies in the [[Treaty of Versailles]] (1919) as Wilson put all his hopes in the new [[League of Nations]].

Bulgaria was ill-prepared for a long war; the absence of so many soldiers sharply reduced agricultural output. Much of its best food was smuggled out to feed lucrative black-markets elsewhere. By 1918 the soldiers were not only short of basic equipment like boots, but they were being fed mostly corn bread with a little meat. Germany increasingly took control, and Bulgarian relations with its ally the Ottoman Empire soured. The Allied offensive in September 1918 destroyed the remnants of Bulgarian military power and civilian morale. Troops mutinied and peasants [[Aleksandar Stamboliyski|revolted]], demanding peace.

Around 175,000 Chinese workers volunteered for well-paid positions in the [[Chinese Labour Corps|labor battalions]]  that served the Allies behind the lines in France,  and Africa and on supply ships.  Some 10,000 died, including over 500 on ships sunk by [[U-boat]]s.   No soldiers were sent overseas.<ref>Guoqi Xu,  ''China and the Great War: China's Pursuit of a New National Identity and Internationalization'' (2011)</ref>\n\n===Japan===\n{{main|Japanese entry into World War I|Japan during World War I}}\nJapan's military seized German possessions in the Pacific and East Asia. but there was no large-scale mobilization of the economy.<ref>Frederick R.

It captured Germany's Micronesian territories north of the equator, and ruled the islands until 1921. The operation gave the navy a rationale for enlarging its budget to double the army budget and expanding the fleet. The Navy thus gained significant political influence over national and international affairs.<ref>J.C.

The government made thousands of arrests and prevented the newspapers from reporting the riots. Some 250,000 people died in the [[1918 flu pandemic|Spanish flu]] epidemic in late 1918.  The death rate was much lower than other major countries because some immunity had developed from a mild outbreak earlier; public health officials successfully warned people to avoid contact; and the use of inoculation, herbals, masks, and gargling.<ref>Geoffrey W.

Two extensions have been constructed, and there are plans for further extensions through to 2025.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Overview==\nThe average daily flow is approximately 0.3&nbsp;[[gigalitre]]s (0.3&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;10<sup>9</sup> litres), out of a London average day demand of approximately 2.0 gigalitres  (2.0&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;10<sup>9</sup> litres).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thameswater.co.uk/about-us/850_2613.htm|title=Our business|publisher=[[Thames Water]]|date=|accessdate=9 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thamestunnelconsultation.co.uk/2012/11/30/sustainable-drainage-and-the-%E2%80%98supersewer%E2%80%99/|title=Sustainable drainage and the Supersewer|first=Richard |last=Aylard|date=November 2012|accessdate=9 March 2013}}</ref> The main currently comprises a major loop linking the [[Hampton, London|Hampton]], [[Walton-on-Thames|Walton]], [[Ashford, Surrey|Ashford]] and [[Kempton Park, Surrey|Kempton]] WTWs clustered on the Thames upstream of [[Teddington Lock|Teddington Weir]] to central London by a southern branch via [[Brixton]] and northern branch via [[Kew]], and a separate unconnected length from [[Coppermill Stream|Coppermills WTW]] to [[Stoke Newington]].  The main is well below most water mains, at a depth of {{convert|10|m|abbr=on}} to {{convert|65|m|abbr=on}} below ground level and approximately {{convert|10|m|abbr=on}} to {{convert|30|m|abbr=on}} below sea-level.  It is connected to water supply zones by some 20 shafts that extend from the main to ground level.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Driver==\nThe main serves as a partial alternative transfer system to existing trunk mains suffering increasing frequencies and severities of leaks and bursts.  Some of the oldest operational pressure mains in the world (the oldest dates from 1838), the high-level trunks have weakened with steady corrosion, and there has been both an increased carrying requirement resulting from increasing water demand, and increasing external stresses resulting from higher vehicle weights and frequencies.  This has been exacerbated by limited system redundancies which has restricted preventative refurbishment.  The main has both extended the operational life of the high-level trunks by reducing the flow demands placed on them, and, by providing a high degree of redundancy, enabling key trunks to be isolated and maintained.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Hydraulics==\nFlow through the main is by gravity under the [[Hydraulic head|driving head]] of the service reservoirs at the source WTWs.  By virtue of its depth, the pipeline is under some pressure; however, the hydraulic grade line rarely exceeds ground level, and, to enter, supply water must be pumped up into the distribution zones at the pump-out shafts.  In some respects, therefore, the main can be considered as a minor reservoir, from which supply is drawn as required.  An indication of this dynamic variation in demand is that the minimum hydraulic level moves between the [[Battersea]] and Park Lane pump-out shafts.  The loop is closed to provide the redundancy that allows any segment on the ring to be isolated and drained for maintenance without interrupting the supply to any shaft, not for hydraulic reasons.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Construction==\nThe main was constructed in two phases: the southern leg from Ashford Common WTW to Barrow Hill Shaft in 1988 to 1991, and the northern leg between the same locations in 1991 to 1993.  Each phase was divided into a number of 'stages' that were separately contracted and constructed largely simultaneously. The different contractors involved in each stage is to some degree reflected in the variation in tunnelling and tunnel construction techniques used.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Geology==\nThe main lies mostly within [[London Clay]] with sections within the overlying alluvium and underlying [[Lambeth Group]] and [[Thanet_Formation|Thanet Sand]]. The predominance of the London Clay lengths is by design, as being easily excavated, largely impermeable and somewhat self-supporting for short periods it is a near-ideal tunnelling material. Where the hydraulics have required entry into the Lambeth Group and Thanet Sand, tunnelling was considerably more difficult. In particular, the Thanet Sand requires a high boring torque, is highly abrasive and, most challengingly, sufficiently permeable to contain a water table continuous with the underlying Chalk and measured at pressures up to {{convert|4|bar|abbr=on}}. An unexpected entry into the Thanet Sand while excavating near [[Tooting Commons|Tooting Bec Common]] led to the flooding of the tunnel and the temporary abandonment of a [[Tunnel boring machine|Tunnel Boring Machine]] (TBM). A further consideration of Thanet Sand is the presence of [[glauconite]], which oxidises on contact with air.

Two extensions have been constructed, and there are plans for further extensions through to 2025.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Overview==\nThe average daily flow is approximately 0.3&nbsp;[[gigalitre]]s (0.3&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;10<sup>9</sup> litres), out of a London average day demand of approximately 2.0 gigalitres  (2.0&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;10<sup>9</sup> litres).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thameswater.co.uk/about-us/850_2613.htm|title=Our business|publisher=[[Thames Water]]|date=|accessdate=9 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thamestunnelconsultation.co.uk/2012/11/30/sustainable-drainage-and-the-%E2%80%98supersewer%E2%80%99/|title=Sustainable drainage and the Supersewer|first=Richard |last=Aylard|date=November 2012|accessdate=9 March 2013}}</ref> The main currently comprises a major loop linking the [[Hampton, London|Hampton]], [[Walton-on-Thames|Walton]], [[Ashford, Surrey|Ashford]] and [[Kempton Park, Surrey|Kempton]] WTWs clustered on the Thames upstream of [[Teddington Lock|Teddington Weir]] to central London by a southern branch via [[Brixton]] and northern branch via [[Kew]], and a separate unconnected length from [[Coppermill Stream|Coppermills WTW]] to [[Stoke Newington]].  The main is well below most water mains, at a depth of {{convert|10|m|abbr=on}} to {{convert|65|m|abbr=on}} below ground level and approximately {{convert|10|m|abbr=on}} to {{convert|30|m|abbr=on}} below sea-level.  It is connected to water supply zones by some 20 shafts that extend from the main to ground level.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Driver==\nThe main serves as a partial alternative transfer system to existing trunk mains suffering increasing frequencies and severities of leaks and bursts.  Some of the oldest operational pressure mains in the world (the oldest dates from 1838), the high-level trunks have weakened with steady corrosion, and there has been both an increased carrying requirement resulting from increasing water demand, and increasing external stresses resulting from higher vehicle weights and frequencies.  This has been exacerbated by limited system redundancies which has restricted preventative refurbishment.  The main has both extended the operational life of the high-level trunks by reducing the flow demands placed on them, and, by providing a high degree of redundancy, enabling key trunks to be isolated and maintained.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Hydraulics==\nFlow through the main is by gravity under the [[Hydraulic head|driving head]] of the service reservoirs at the source WTWs.  By virtue of its depth, the pipeline is under some pressure; however, the hydraulic grade line rarely exceeds ground level, and, to enter, supply water must be pumped up into the distribution zones at the pump-out shafts.  In some respects, therefore, the main can be considered as a minor reservoir, from which supply is drawn as required.  An indication of this dynamic variation in demand is that the minimum hydraulic level moves between the [[Battersea]] and Park Lane pump-out shafts.  The loop is closed to provide the redundancy that allows any segment on the ring to be isolated and drained for maintenance without interrupting the supply to any shaft, not for hydraulic reasons.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Construction==\nThe main was constructed in two phases: the southern leg from Ashford Common WTW to Barrow Hill Shaft in 1988 to 1991, and the northern leg between the same locations in 1991 to 1993.  Each phase was divided into a number of 'stages' that were separately contracted and constructed largely simultaneously. The different contractors involved in each stage is to some degree reflected in the variation in tunnelling and tunnel construction techniques used.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Geology==\nThe main lies mostly within [[London Clay]] with sections within the overlying alluvium and underlying [[Lambeth Group]] and [[Thanet_Formation|Thanet Sand]]. The predominance of the London Clay lengths is by design, as being easily excavated, largely impermeable and somewhat self-supporting for short periods it is a near-ideal tunnelling material. Where the hydraulics have required entry into the Lambeth Group and Thanet Sand, tunnelling was considerably more difficult. In particular, the Thanet Sand requires a high boring torque, is highly abrasive and, most challengingly, sufficiently permeable to contain a water table continuous with the underlying Chalk and measured at pressures up to {{convert|4|bar|abbr=on}}. An unexpected entry into the Thanet Sand while excavating near [[Tooting Commons|Tooting Bec Common]] led to the flooding of the tunnel and the temporary abandonment of a [[Tunnel boring machine|Tunnel Boring Machine]] (TBM). A further consideration of Thanet Sand is the presence of [[glauconite]], which oxidises on contact with air. The resulting de-oxygenated air resulted in two fatalities during the excavation of a pump-out shaft.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Future==\nThe main will be extended in stages over the coming decades.
