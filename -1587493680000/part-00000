This ensures that a bug or even unknowingly incompatible software won't corrupt the contents of such devices.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://freespace.sourceforge.net/guidod/howto/autofs.html | title=AutoFS | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100814191611/http://freespace.sourceforge.net/guidod/howto/autofs.html | archivedate=2010-08-14 }}</ref>{{better source|date=August 2016}}\n\nPuppy Linux offers a session save on shutdown. Since Puppy Linux fundamentally runs in RAM, any files and configurations made or changed in a session would disappear otherwise. This feature enables the user to either save the contents to a writable storage medium, or write the file system to the same CD containing Puppy, if \"multisession\" was used to create the booted CD and if the disc drive supports burning. This applies to CD-Rs as well as CD-RWs and DVDs.\n\nIt is also possible to save all files to an external hard drive, USB stick, or even a floppy disk instead of the root file system. Puppy can also be installed to a hard disk.<ref name=\"Eckstein08Ju10\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kmeckstein.com/linux/and-they-call-it-puppy-love/ |title=And they call it Puppy Love\u2026 |accessdate=9 July 2010 |last=Eckstein |first=Keith |date=July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100711131239/http://www.kmeckstein.com/linux/and-they-call-it-puppy-love/ |archivedate=July 11, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==User interface==\n[[File:Puppylinux-215ce2.jpg|thumb|Desktop with one of multiple integrated themes with XMMS a multimedia player, [[mtPaint]] a painting program for creating pixel art and manipulating digital photos and mplayer running, plus an opened text file under Puppy Linux 2.15 CE Viz (with default WM: IceWM)]]\n[[File:WNOP02 EeePC 1.jpg|thumb|wNOP v0.2 on EeePC: Puppy 3.01 & Compiz-Fusion]]\nThe default [[window manager]] in most Puppy releases is [[JWM]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://puppylinux.org/wikka/JoesWindowManager | title=JWM| website=PuppyLinux.org}}</ref>\n\nPackages of the [[IceWM]] desktop, [[Fluxbox]] and [[Enlightenment (window manager)|Enlightenment]] are also available via Puppy's PetGet package (application) management system (see below).

The PC needs to have at least 128 MB of RAM (with no more than 8 MB shared video) for all of Puppy to load into the ramdisk. However, it is possible for it to run on a PC with only about 48 MB of RAM because part of the system can be kept on the hard drive, or less effectively, left on the CD.\n\nPuppy is fairly full-featured for a system that runs entirely in a ramdisk, when booted as Live system or from a 'frugal' installation. However, Puppy also supports the 'full' installation mode, which enables Puppy to run from a hard drive partition, without a ramdisk. Applications were chosen that met various constraints, size in particular. Because one of the aims of the distribution is to be extremely easy to set up, there are many [[wizard (software)|wizards]] that guide the user through a wide variety of common tasks.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.puppylinux.org/home/overview|title=AboutPuppy - Puppy Linux|accessdate=2008-08-02 |work= |publisher= |date= |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080621101141/http://puppylinux.org/home/overview <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-06-21}}</ref>{{Citation needed|reason=third-party|date=July 2010}}\n\n==Package and distribution management==\n[[File:Puppy Package Manager showing indic fonts package.png|thumb|Puppy Package Manager showing Slackware 14 indic fonts package]]\nPuppy Linux's package manager, ''Puppy Package Manager'', installs packages in PET (Puppy Enhanced Tarball) format by default but it also accepts packages from other distros (such as [[.deb]], [[.rpm]], [[.txz]], and [[.tgz]] packages) or by using third-party tools to convert packages from other distros to PET packages.

It consists of more than 500 packages that are put together according to the user's needs. However, on later versions starting with Puppy Linux version 5.0, it was replaced by Woof. It is an advanced tool for creating Puppy installations. It requires an Internet connection and some knowledge of Linux to use. It is able to download the binary source packages from another [[Linux distribution]] and process them into Puppy Linux packages by just defining the name of that Linux distro.<ref>{{cite web |author=Barry Kauler |title=Woof: the \"Puppy builder\" |url=http://bkhome.org/woof/ |date=March 2010}}</ref> It is equipped with a simpler version control named Bones on earlier releases but on later versions of woof, Fossil version control is used.<ref>{{cite web |author=Barry Kauler |title=Bones: version control |url=http://bkhome.org/bones/index.html |date=March 2010}}</ref>\n\nPuppy also comes with a remastering tool that takes a \"snapshot\" of the current system and lets the user create a live CD from it, and an additional remastering tool that is able to remove installed components.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\nPuppy Linux uses the [[T2 SDE]] build scripts to build the base binary packages.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\n==Official variants==\nBecause of the relative ease with which the Woof tool and the remaster tool can be used to build variants of Puppy Linux, there are many variants available.<ref name=\"Puppy5\" /><ref>{{cite web|title=PuppyLinux: Puplets|url=http://puppylinux.org/wikka/Puplets}}</ref> Variants of Puppy Linux are known as ''puplets''.\n\nAfter Barry Kauler reduced his involvement with the Puppy Project, he designed two new distributions within the same Puppy Linux family, Quirky and Wary.\n\n'''Quirky''' \u2013 An embedded, less-stable distro with all files contained in an [[initramfs]] built into the kernel.

I've never heard of a single Puppy user suffering a problem due to this.\" Fosdick concluded \"I like Puppy because it's the lightest Linux distro I've found that is still suitable for end users.

He praised its simplicity, flexibility and clear explanations, while noting the limitations of running as root. He concluded \"I would also like to see an option added during the boot process which would give the user the choice of running in unprivileged mode as opposed to running as root. Always being the administrator has its advantages for convenience, but it means that the user is always one careless click away from deleting their files and one exploit away from a compromised operating system. As a live CD it's hard to beat Puppy Linux for both performance and functional software. It has minimal hardware requirements and is very flexible.

He concluded, \"Puppy's diversity and flexibility make it a great community-driven system for computer enthusiasts, hobbyists, and tinkerers. They also make for a somewhat disorderly world. You might have to read a bit to figure out which Puppy release or Puplet is for you. Puppy's online documentation is extensive but can be confusing. It's not always clear which docs pertain to which releases. Most users rely on the active, friendly forum for support.\" He also noted \"Those of us who enjoy computers sometimes forget that many view them with disdain. What's wrong with it now? Why do I have to buy a new one every four years? Why on earth do they change the interface in every release? Can't it just work? Puppy is a great solution for these folks. It's up-to-date, free, and easy to use. And now, it supports free applications from the Ubuntu, Slackware, or Puppy repositories.

Raspbian is based on Debian, meaning that Puppy Linux still has Debian/Ubuntu support.  This version of Puppy Linux is not compatible with personal computers, like desktops or laptops.\n\n== Features ==\nPuppy Linux is a complete operating system bundled with a collection of applications suited to general use tasks. It can be used as a [[rescue disk]],<ref>{{cite web | url = http://lifehacker.com/307542/taking-puppy-linux-for-a-walk | title = Taking Puppy Linux for a Walk}}</ref> a demonstration system that leaves the previous installation unaltered, as an accommodation for a system with a blank or missing hard drive, or for using modern software on legacy computers.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.wikihow.com/Revive-an-old-PC-with-Linux | title = Reviving old computer}}</ref>\n\nPuppy's compact size allows it to boot from any media that the computer can support. It can function as a [[live USB]] for [[USB flash drive|flash devices]] or other [[Universal serial bus|USB]] mediums, a [[live CD|CD]], an internal [[hard disk drive]], an [[SD card]], a [[Zip drive]] or LS-120/240 [[SuperDisk]], through [[Preboot Execution Environment|PXE]], and through a floppy [[boot disk]] that chainloads the data from other storage media. It has also been ported to ARM and can run on a single board computer such as the [[Raspberry Pi]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://puppylinux.org/wikka/ARM | title = ARM | publisher = PuppyLinux | date = May 29, 2013 | accessdate = August 12, 2013}}</ref>\n\nPuppy Linux features built-in tools which can be used to create bootable USB drives, create new Puppy CDs, or remaster a new live CD with different packages.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.puppylinux.org/manuals/puppy-40/english/make-your-own-puppy-cd | title = Make your own Puppy-CD | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081013135129/http://www.puppylinux.org/manuals/puppy-40/english/make-your-own-puppy-cd | archive-date = October 13, 2008 | accessdate = August 19, 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://puppylinux.org/wikka/Remastering | title = Remastering | website = Puppy Linux Wiki | access-date = August 19, 2016}}</ref> It also uses a sophisticated write-caching system with the purpose of extending the life of live USB flash drives.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://barryk.org/puppylinux/development/howpuppyworks.html | title = How Puppy Works | date = September 9, 2006 | last = Kauler | first = Barry | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160819184554/http://barryk.org/puppylinux/development/howpuppyworks.html | archive-date = August 19, 2016 | url-status = live | access-date = August 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\nPuppy Linux includes the ability to use a normal persistent updating environment on a write-once multisession CD/DVD that does not require a rewritable disc; this is a unique feature that sets it apart from other Linux distributions.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://puppylinux.com/multi-puppy.htm | title = Puppy Multisession DVD/CD}}</ref> While other distributions offer [[live CD]] versions of their operating systems, none offer a similar feature.\n\nPuppy's bootloader does not mount hard drives or connect to the network automatically. This ensures that a bug or even unknowingly incompatible software won't corrupt the contents of such devices.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://freespace.sourceforge.net/guidod/howto/autofs.html | title=AutoFS | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100814191611/http://freespace.sourceforge.net/guidod/howto/autofs.html | archivedate=2010-08-14 }}</ref>{{better source|date=August 2016}}\n\nPuppy Linux offers a session save on shutdown. Since Puppy Linux fundamentally runs in RAM, any files and configurations made or changed in a session would disappear otherwise. This feature enables the user to either save the contents to a writable storage medium, or write the file system to the same CD containing Puppy, if \"multisession\" was used to create the booted CD and if the disc drive supports burning. This applies to CD-Rs as well as CD-RWs and DVDs.\n\nIt is also possible to save all files to an external hard drive, USB stick, or even a floppy disk instead of the root file system. Puppy can also be installed to a hard disk.<ref name=\"Eckstein08Ju10\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kmeckstein.com/linux/and-they-call-it-puppy-love/ |title=And they call it Puppy Love\u2026 |accessdate=9 July 2010 |last=Eckstein |first=Keith |date=July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100711131239/http://www.kmeckstein.com/linux/and-they-call-it-puppy-love/ |archivedate=July 11, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==User interface==\n[[File:Puppylinux-215ce2.jpg|thumb|Desktop with one of multiple integrated themes with XMMS a multimedia player, [[mtPaint]] a painting program for creating pixel art and manipulating digital photos and mplayer running, plus an opened text file under Puppy Linux 2.15 CE Viz (with default WM: IceWM)]]\n[[File:WNOP02 EeePC 1.jpg|thumb|wNOP v0.2 on EeePC: Puppy 3.01 & Compiz-Fusion]]\nThe default [[window manager]] in most Puppy releases is [[JWM]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://puppylinux.org/wikka/JoesWindowManager | title=JWM| website=PuppyLinux.org}}</ref>\n\nPackages of the [[IceWM]] desktop, [[Fluxbox]] and [[Enlightenment (window manager)|Enlightenment]] are also available via Puppy's PetGet package (application) management system (see below). Some derivative distributions, called ''puplets'', come with default window managers other than JWM.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://pupweb.org/wikka/IceWM | title=IceWM | website=PupWeb.org}}</ref>\n\nWhen the operating system boots, everything in the Puppy package uncompresses into a RAM area, the \"[[ramdisk]]\". The PC needs to have at least 128 MB of RAM (with no more than 8 MB shared video) for all of Puppy to load into the ramdisk. However, it is possible for it to run on a PC with only about 48 MB of RAM because part of the system can be kept on the hard drive, or less effectively, left on the CD.\n\nPuppy is fairly full-featured for a system that runs entirely in a ramdisk, when booted as Live system or from a 'frugal' installation. However, Puppy also supports the 'full' installation mode, which enables Puppy to run from a hard drive partition, without a ramdisk. Applications were chosen that met various constraints, size in particular. Because one of the aims of the distribution is to be extremely easy to set up, there are many [[wizard (software)|wizards]] that guide the user through a wide variety of common tasks.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.puppylinux.org/home/overview|title=AboutPuppy - Puppy Linux|accessdate=2008-08-02 |work= |publisher= |date= |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080621101141/http://puppylinux.org/home/overview <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-06-21}}</ref>{{Citation needed|reason=third-party|date=July 2010}}\n\n==Package and distribution management==\n[[File:Puppy Package Manager showing indic fonts package.png|thumb|Puppy Package Manager showing Slackware 14 indic fonts package]]\nPuppy Linux's package manager, ''Puppy Package Manager'', installs packages in PET (Puppy Enhanced Tarball) format by default but it also accepts packages from other distros (such as [[.deb]], [[.rpm]], [[.txz]], and [[.tgz]] packages) or by using third-party tools to convert packages from other distros to PET packages.

It consists of more than 500 packages that are put together according to the user's needs. However, on later versions starting with Puppy Linux version 5.0, it was replaced by Woof. It is an advanced tool for creating Puppy installations. It requires an Internet connection and some knowledge of Linux to use. It is able to download the binary source packages from another [[Linux distribution]] and process them into Puppy Linux packages by just defining the name of that Linux distro.<ref>{{cite web |author=Barry Kauler |title=Woof: the \"Puppy builder\" |url=http://bkhome.org/woof/ |date=March 2010}}</ref> It is equipped with a simpler version control named Bones on earlier releases but on later versions of woof, Fossil version control is used.<ref>{{cite web |author=Barry Kauler |title=Bones: version control |url=http://bkhome.org/bones/index.html |date=March 2010}}</ref>\n\nPuppy also comes with a remastering tool that takes a \"snapshot\" of the current system and lets the user create a live CD from it, and an additional remastering tool that is able to remove installed components.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\nPuppy Linux uses the [[T2 SDE]] build scripts to build the base binary packages.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\n==Official variants==\nBecause of the relative ease with which the Woof tool and the remaster tool can be used to build variants of Puppy Linux, there are many variants available.<ref name=\"Puppy5\" /><ref>{{cite web|title=PuppyLinux: Puplets|url=http://puppylinux.org/wikka/Puplets}}</ref> Variants of Puppy Linux are known as ''puplets''.\n\nAfter Barry Kauler reduced his involvement with the Puppy Project, he designed two new distributions within the same Puppy Linux family, Quirky and Wary.\n\n'''Quirky''' \u2013 An embedded, less-stable distro with all files contained in an [[initramfs]] built into the kernel.

I've never heard of a single Puppy user suffering a problem due to this.\" Fosdick concluded \"I like Puppy because it's the lightest Linux distro I've found that is still suitable for end users.

He praised its simplicity, flexibility and clear explanations, while noting the limitations of running as root. He concluded \"I would also like to see an option added during the boot process which would give the user the choice of running in unprivileged mode as opposed to running as root. Always being the administrator has its advantages for convenience, but it means that the user is always one careless click away from deleting their files and one exploit away from a compromised operating system. As a live CD it's hard to beat Puppy Linux for both performance and functional software. It has minimal hardware requirements and is very flexible. It's a great distro as long as you don't push it too far out of its niche.\"<ref name=\"Smith12Dec11\">{{Cite news|url = http://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20111212#feature|title = Review: Puppy Linux 5.3 \"Slacko\"|accessdate = 12 December 2011|last = Smith|first = Jesse|date = 12 December 2011| work = [[DistroWatch]]}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2011 Howard Fosdick reviewed the versions of Puppy Linux then available. He concluded, \"Puppy's diversity and flexibility make it a great community-driven system for computer enthusiasts, hobbyists, and tinkerers. They also make for a somewhat disorderly world. You might have to read a bit to figure out which Puppy release or Puplet is for you. Puppy's online documentation is extensive but can be confusing. It's not always clear which docs pertain to which releases. Most users rely on the active, friendly forum for support.\" He also noted \"Those of us who enjoy computers sometimes forget that many view them with disdain. What's wrong with it now? Why do I have to buy a new one every four years? Why on earth do they change the interface in every release? Can't it just work? Puppy is a great solution for these folks. It's up-to-date, free, and easy to use. And now, it supports free applications from the Ubuntu, Slackware, or Puppy repositories.
