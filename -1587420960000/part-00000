The treaty however was [[Treaty|abrogated]] as France failed to provide the aid.\n\nIt was only under conquest that the islands came under French control in 1861. During the [[French Indochina|French colonial era]] [[C\u00f4n S\u01a1n Island]] was made infamous for its [[Con Dao Prison|penal facilities]] and the notorious \"tiger cages\". Vietnamese and Cambodian nationalists and revolutionaries were sent here to serve their sentence for anti-French activities. Many Vietnamese Communist leaders were \"schooled\" on C\u00f4n \u0110\u1ea3o Island as well.\n\nThe French Indochinese government named the group of islands '''Poulo-Condore Islands''', a name that derives from the islands' [[Malay language|Malay]] name '''Pulo Condore'''<ref>{{cite web|title=Pulo Condore Group, Vietnam|url=http://www.geographic.org/geographic_names/name.php?uni=-4954156&fid=6654&c=vietnam|publisher=National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency|accessdate=25 August 2011}}</ref> (''pulo'' as a corruption of ''pulau'', meaning \"island\").\n\n==C\u00f4n \u0110\u1ea3o National Park==\nMany of the islands were given protected status in 1984 as part of [[C\u00f4n \u0110\u1ea3o National Park]]. This natural preserve was subsequently enlarged in 1998. Endangered species protected within the park include the [[hawksbill turtle]], the [[green turtle]], [[dolphin]]s,<ref>http://www.condaopark.com.vn/vn/gioi-thieu/gioi-thieu-vuon-quoc-gia-con-dao.html</ref> and the [[dugong]]. [[Ecosystem]]s represented in the park include [[seagrass meadow]], [[mangrove]] and [[coral reef]]s.\n\nC\u00f4n \u0110\u1ea3o National Park is working with the [[World Wildlife Fund]] (WWF) Vietnam to further protection in the marine areas, with programs to establish a Marine Protected Area that protects coral reefs, seagrass beds and species, while also developing sustainable nature-based ecotourism. The island's management is strongly geared towards sustainable use, hoping to learn from previous experiences in Vietnam and the region to balance development with conservation.\n\n== Ferry ==\nA new hydrofoil service from V\u0169ng T\u00e0u to C\u00f4n \u0110\u1ea3o was started in February 2019. The service is a daily return and boasts that the ferry will operate year round, regardless of the weather. Travel time is 4\u20135 hours, departing V\u0169ng T\u00e0u at 8am and returning from C\u00f4n \u0110\u1ea3o at around 2pm.\n\nTwo ferries operate between C\u00f4n \u0110\u1ea3o and the mainland. There is a daily overnight hour ferry service from [[V\u0169ng T\u00e0u]] which, in addition to bringing passengers, serves as the main source of importing goods to the islands. The ferry operates on a daily basis, however in winter months the service depends largely on weather conditions as the seas between C\u00f4n \u0110\u1ea3o and the mainland can be rough.\n\nIn 2016 a new ferry service primarily for passengers opened up between [[S\u00f3c Tr\u0103ng]] and C\u00f4n \u0110\u1ea3o, shortening the length of the journey to three hours. With the addition of a fast ferry to the islands, the islands have experienced an increase in tourism fueled mostly by domestic tourists who view C\u00f4n \u0110\u1ea3o as a sacred place due to its history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://conbeo.com/explore-vietnam/con-dao-island-ferry/|title=Con Dao Islands Ferry|website=conbeo.com}}</ref>\n\n==List of islands==\nC\u00f4n \u0110\u1ea3o Islands include 16 islands, with a total area of 76&nbsp;km\u00b2:\n\n* C\u00f4n L\u00f4n Island or C\u00f4n S\u01a1n ([[Grande-Condore]]), Ph\u00fa H\u1ea3i, 51.52&nbsp;km\u00b2\n* Little C\u00f4n L\u00f4n Island (Petite-Condore), or H\u00f2n B\u00e0, Ph\u00fa S\u01a1n, 5.45&nbsp;km\u00b2\n* B\u1ea3y C\u1ea1nh Island, or B\u00e3i C\u1ea1nh Island, Ph\u00fa H\u00f2a, 5.5&nbsp;km\u00b2\n* Cau Island, or Ph\u00fa L\u1ec7 1.8&nbsp;km\u00b2\n* B\u00f4ng Lan Island, or B\u00f4ng Lang, B\u00f4ng Lau, Ph\u00fa Phong, 0.2&nbsp;km\u00b2\n* Vung Island, or Ph\u00fa Vinh 0.15&nbsp;km\u00b2\n* Ng\u1ecdc Island, or Tr\u1ecdc Island, h\u00f2n Trai, Ph\u00fa Ngh\u0129a, 0.4&nbsp;km\u00b2\n* Tr\u1ee9ng Island, or \u0110\u00e1 B\u1ea1c Island, \u0110\u00e1 Tr\u1eafng Island, Ph\u00fa Th\u1ecd, 0.1&nbsp;km\u00b2\n* T\u00e0i L\u1edbn Island, or Ph\u00fa B\u00ecnh 0.38&nbsp;km\u00b2\n* T\u00e0i Nh\u1ecf Island, or Th\u1ecf Island, Ph\u00fa An, 0.1&nbsp;km\u00b2\n* Tr\u00e1c L\u1edbn Island, or Ph\u00fa H\u01b0ng 0.25&nbsp;km\u00b2\n* Tr\u00e1c Nh\u1ecf Island, or Ph\u00fa Th\u1ecbnh 0.1&nbsp;km\u00b2\n* Tre L\u1edbn Island, or Ph\u00fa H\u00f2a 0.75&nbsp;km\u00b2\n* Tre Nh\u1ecf Island, or Ph\u00fa H\u1ed9i, 0.25&nbsp;km\u00b2\n* Anh Island, or Tr\u1ee9ng L\u1edbn Island\n* Em Island, or Tr\u1ee9ng Nh\u1ecf Island\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikivoyage}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080322005213/http://artific.org/public/galleri_tag.php Con Dao photos]\n* The Kun Lun Shan islands are shown on sheet 11 of the [[Mao Kun map]] [https://www.loc.gov/resource/g7821rm.gct00058/?st=gallery Wu Bei Zhi at the Library of Congress]\n*[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258698786_Bin_o_Vit_Nam_-_Ti_nguyn_v_th_v_nhng_k_quan_sinh_thi_a_cht_tiu_biu?ev=prf_pub Vietnamese Sea and Islands \u2013 position Resources, and  typical geological and ecological wonders.

Endangered species protected within the park include the [[hawksbill turtle]], the [[green turtle]], [[dolphin]]s,<ref>http://www.condaopark.com.vn/vn/gioi-thieu/gioi-thieu-vuon-quoc-gia-con-dao.html</ref> and the [[dugong]]. [[Ecosystem]]s represented in the park include [[seagrass meadow]], [[mangrove]] and [[coral reef]]s.\n\nC\u00f4n \u0110\u1ea3o National Park is working with the [[World Wildlife Fund]] (WWF) Vietnam to further protection in the marine areas, with programs to establish a Marine Protected Area that protects coral reefs, seagrass beds and species, while also developing sustainable nature-based ecotourism. The island's management is strongly geared towards sustainable use, hoping to learn from previous experiences in Vietnam and the region to balance development with conservation.\n\n== Ferry ==\nA new hydrofoil service from V\u0169ng T\u00e0u to C\u00f4n \u0110\u1ea3o was started in February 2019. The service is a daily return and boasts that the ferry will operate year round, regardless of the weather. Travel time is 4-5 hours, departing V\u0169ng T\u00e0u at 8am and returning from C\u00f4n \u0110\u1ea3o at around 2pm.\n\nTwo ferries operate between C\u00f4n \u0110\u1ea3o and the mainland. There is a daily overnight hour ferry service from [[V\u0169ng T\u00e0u]] which, in addition to bringing passengers, serves as the main source of importing goods to the islands. The ferry operates on a daily basis, however in winter months the service depends largely on weather conditions as the seas between C\u00f4n \u0110\u1ea3o and the mainland can be rough.\n\nIn 2016 a new ferry service primarily for passengers opened up between [[S\u00f3c Tr\u0103ng]] and C\u00f4n \u0110\u1ea3o, shortening the length of the journey to three hours. With the addition of a fast ferry to the islands, the islands have experienced an increase in tourism fueled mostly by domestic tourists who view C\u00f4n \u0110\u1ea3o as a sacred place due to its history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://conbeo.com/explore-vietnam/con-dao-island-ferry/|title=Con Dao Islands Ferry|website=conbeo.com}}</ref>\n\n==List of islands==\nC\u00f4n \u0110\u1ea3o Islands include 16 islands, with a total area of 76&nbsp;km\u00b2:\n\n* C\u00f4n L\u00f4n Island or C\u00f4n S\u01a1n ([[Grande-Condore]]), Ph\u00fa H\u1ea3i, 51.52&nbsp;km\u00b2\n* Little C\u00f4n L\u00f4n Island (Petite-Condore), or H\u00f2n B\u00e0, Ph\u00fa S\u01a1n, 5.45&nbsp;km\u00b2\n* B\u1ea3y C\u1ea1nh Island, or B\u00e3i C\u1ea1nh Island, Ph\u00fa H\u00f2a, 5.5&nbsp;km\u00b2\n* Cau Island, or Ph\u00fa L\u1ec7 1.8&nbsp;km\u00b2\n* B\u00f4ng Lan Island, or B\u00f4ng Lang, B\u00f4ng Lau, Ph\u00fa Phong, 0.2&nbsp;km\u00b2\n* Vung Island, or Ph\u00fa Vinh 0.15&nbsp;km\u00b2\n* Ng\u1ecdc Island, or Tr\u1ecdc Island, h\u00f2n Trai, Ph\u00fa Ngh\u0129a, 0.4&nbsp;km\u00b2\n* Tr\u1ee9ng Island, or \u0110\u00e1 B\u1ea1c Island, \u0110\u00e1 Tr\u1eafng Island, Ph\u00fa Th\u1ecd, 0.1&nbsp;km\u00b2\n* T\u00e0i L\u1edbn Island, or Ph\u00fa B\u00ecnh 0.38&nbsp;km\u00b2\n* T\u00e0i Nh\u1ecf Island, or Th\u1ecf Island, Ph\u00fa An, 0.1&nbsp;km\u00b2\n* Tr\u00e1c L\u1edbn Island, or Ph\u00fa H\u01b0ng 0.25&nbsp;km\u00b2\n* Tr\u00e1c Nh\u1ecf Island, or Ph\u00fa Th\u1ecbnh 0.1&nbsp;km\u00b2\n* Tre L\u1edbn Island, or Ph\u00fa H\u00f2a 0.75&nbsp;km\u00b2\n* Tre Nh\u1ecf Island, or Ph\u00fa H\u1ed9i, 0.25&nbsp;km\u00b2\n* Anh Island, or Tr\u1ee9ng L\u1edbn Island\n* Em Island, or Tr\u1ee9ng Nh\u1ecf Island\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikivoyage}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080322005213/http://artific.org/public/galleri_tag.php Con Dao photos]\n* The Kun Lun Shan islands are shown on sheet 11 of the [[Mao Kun map]] [https://www.loc.gov/resource/g7821rm.gct00058/?st=gallery Wu Bei Zhi at the Library of Congress]\n*[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258698786_Bin_o_Vit_Nam_-_Ti_nguyn_v_th_v_nhng_k_quan_sinh_thi_a_cht_tiu_biu?ev=prf_pub Vietnamese Sea and Islands \u2013 position Resources, and  typical geological and ecological wonders.

A moderate [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], he was a cabinet official under two governors of Massachusetts and served ten years as [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) of [[Harvard Pilgrim Health Care]].\n\nBaker grew up in [[Needham, Massachusetts]], earned an [[Bachelor of Arts|AB]] from [[Harvard University]] in 1979, and later obtained an [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] from [[Northwestern University]]'s [[Kellogg School of Management]]. In 1991, he became Massachusetts Undersecretary of Health and Human Services under Governor [[Bill Weld]]. In 1992, he was appointed Secretary of Health and Human Services of Massachusetts. He later served as Secretary of Administration and Finance under Weld and his successor, [[Paul Cellucci]].\n\nAfter working in government for eight years, Baker left to become CEO of [[Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates]] and later Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, a non-profit health benefits company. During this time he served three years as a [[Board of selectmen|selectman]] of [[Swampscott, Massachusetts|Swampscott]] and considered a run for Massachusetts governor in [[2006 Massachusetts gubernatorial election|2006]]. He stepped down in July 2009 to run for governor on a platform of [[fiscal conservatism]] and [[cultural liberalism]]. He was unopposed in the Republican primary but lost in the [[2010 Massachusetts gubernatorial election|2010 general election]] to the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] incumbent, [[Deval Patrick]].\n\nIn [[2014 Massachusetts gubernatorial election|2014]], Baker ran for the office again, and narrowly defeated Democratic nominee [[Martha Coakley]].

A moderate [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], he was a cabinet official under two governors of Massachusetts and served ten years as [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) of [[Harvard Pilgrim Health Care]].\n\nBaker grew up in [[Needham, Massachusetts]], earned an [[Bachelor of Arts|AB]] from [[Harvard University]] in 1979, and later obtained an [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] from [[Northwestern University]]'s [[Kellogg School of Management]]. In 1991, he became Massachusetts Undersecretary of Health and Human Services under Governor [[Bill Weld]]. In 1992, he was appointed Secretary of Health and Human Services of Massachusetts. He later served as Secretary of Administration and Finance under Weld and his successor, [[Paul Cellucci]].\n\nAfter working in government for eight years, Baker left to become CEO of [[Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates]] and later Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, a non-profit health benefits company. During this time he served three years as a [[Board of selectmen|selectman]] of [[Swampscott, Massachusetts|Swampscott]] and considered a run for Massachusetts governor in [[2006 Massachusetts gubernatorial election|2006]]. He stepped down in July 2009 to run for governor on a platform of [[fiscal conservatism]] and [[cultural liberalism]].
