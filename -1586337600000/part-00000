Eliot's paternal grandfather, [[William Greenleaf Eliot]], had moved to [[St. Louis]], Missouri,<ref name=EB/><ref>Bush, Ronald, ''T. S. Eliot: The Modernist in History'' (New York, 1991), p. 72.</ref> to establish a Unitarian Christian church there. His father, [[Henry Ware Eliot]] (1843\u20131919), was a successful businessman, president and treasurer of the Hydraulic-Press Brick Company in St Louis. His mother, [[Charlotte Champe Stearns]] (1843\u20131929), wrote poetry and was a social worker, a new profession in the early 20th century. Eliot was the last of six surviving children. Known to family and friends as Tom, he was the namesake of his maternal grandfather, Thomas Stearns.\n\nEliot's childhood infatuation with literature can be ascribed to several factors. First, he had to overcome physical limitations as a child. Struggling from a congenital double [[inguinal hernia]], he could not participate in many physical activities and thus was prevented from socialising with his peers. As he was often isolated, his love for literature developed. Once he learned to read, the young boy immediately became obsessed with books, favouring tales of savage life, the Wild West, or [[Mark Twain]]'s thrill-seeking [[Tom Sawyer]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Worthen|first=John|title=T.S. Eliot: A Short Biography|year=2009|publisher=Haus Publishing|location=London|page=9}}</ref> In his memoir of Eliot, his friend Robert Sencourt comments that the young Eliot \"would often curl up in the window-seat behind an enormous book, setting the drug of dreams against the pain of living.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Sencourt|first=Robert|title=T.S. Eliot, A Memoir|year=1971|publisher=Garnstone Limited|location=London|page=18}}</ref> Secondly, Eliot credited his hometown with fuelling his literary vision: \"It is self-evident that St. Louis affected me more deeply than any other environment has ever done. I feel that there is something in having passed one's childhood beside the [[Mississippi River|big river]], which is incommunicable to those people who have not. I consider myself fortunate to have been born here, rather than in Boston, or New York, or London.\"<ref>Letter to Marquis Childs quoted in ''St. Louis Post Dispatch'' (15 October 1930) and in the address \"American Literature and the American Language\" delivered at [[Washington University in St. Louis]] (9 June 1953), published in Washington University Studies, ''New Series: Literature and Language'', no. 23 (St. Louis: Washington University Press, 1953), p. 6.</ref>\n\nFrom 1898 to 1905, Eliot attended [[Mary Institute and St. Louis Country Day School|Smith Academy]], the boys college preparatory division of [[Washington University in St. Louis|Washington University]], where his studies included Latin, Ancient Greek, French, and German. He began to write poetry when he was fourteen under the influence of [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward Fitzgerald]]'s translation of the ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]].''

He first visited [[Marburg]], Germany, where he planned to take a summer programme, but when the [[First World War]] broke out he went to Oxford instead. At the time so many American students attended Merton that the [[Junior Common Room]] proposed a motion \"that this society abhors the [[Americanization]] of Oxford\". It was defeated by two votes after Eliot reminded the students how much they owed American culture.<ref name=SeymourJones1>Seymour-Jones, Carole.

Oxford is very pretty, but I don't like to be dead.\"<ref name=SeymourJones1/> Escaping Oxford, Eliot spent much of his time in London. This city had a monumental and life-altering effect on Eliot for several reasons, the most significant of which was his introduction to the influential American literary figure [[Ezra Pound]]. A connection through Aiken resulted in an arranged meeting and on 22 September 1914, Eliot paid a visit to Pound's flat. Pound instantly deemed Eliot \"worth watching\" and was crucial to Eliot's beginning career as a poet, as he is credited with promoting Eliot through social events and literary gatherings. Thus, according to biographer John Worthen, during his time in England Eliot \"was seeing as little of Oxford as possible\". He was instead spending long periods of time in London, in the company of Ezra Pound and \"some of the modern artists whom the war has so far spared... It was Pound who helped most, introducing him everywhere.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Worthen|first=John|title=T.S.

In 1915 he taught English at [[Birkbeck, University of London]].\n\nBy 1916, he had completed a doctoral dissertation for Harvard on \"Knowledge and Experience in the Philosophy of [[F. H.

The couple formally separated in 1933 and in 1938 Vivienne's brother, Maurice, had her committed to a mental hospital, against her will, where she remained until her death of heart disease in 1947. \n\nTheir relationship became the subject of a 1984 play ''[[Tom & Viv (play)|Tom & Viv]]'', which in 1994 was adapted as a film of [[Tom & Viv|the same name]].\n\nIn a private paper written in his sixties, Eliot confessed: \"I came to persuade myself that I was in love with Vivienne simply because I wanted to burn my boats and commit myself to staying in England. And she persuaded herself (also under the influence of [Ezra] Pound) that she would save the poet by keeping him in England. To her, the marriage brought no happiness.

He was aware of this even early in his career. He wrote to J.H. Woods, one of his former Harvard professors, \"My reputation in London is built upon one small volume of verse, and is kept up by printing two or three more poems in a year. The only thing that matters is that these should be perfect in their kind, so that each should be an event.\"<ref>Eliot, T. S. \"Letter to J. H. Woods, April 21, 1919.\" ''The Letters of T. S. Eliot'', vol. I. Valerie Eliot (ed.), New York: Harcourt Brace, 1988, p. 285.</ref>\n\nTypically, Eliot first published his poems individually in periodicals or in small books or pamphlets and then collected them in books. His first collection was ''Prufrock and Other Observations'' (1917). In 1920, he published more poems in ''Ara Vos Prec'' (London) and ''Poems: 1920'' (New York). These had the same poems (in a different order) except that \"Ode\" in the British edition was replaced with \"Hysteria\" in the American edition. In 1925, he collected ''The Waste Land'' and the poems in ''Prufrock'' and ''Poems'' into one volume and added ''The Hollow Men'' to form ''Poems: 1909\u20131925''. From then on, he updated this work as ''Collected Poems''. Exceptions are ''Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats'' (1939), a collection of light verse; ''Poems Written in Early Youth'', posthumously published in 1967 and consisting mainly of poems published between 1907 and 1910 in ''[[The Harvard Advocate]]'', and ''Inventions of the March Hare: Poems 1909\u20131917'', material Eliot never intended to have published, which appeared posthumously in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theworld.com/~raparker/exploring/tseliot/works/poems/eliot-harvard-poems.html |title=T.

That I'm sure of. ... It wouldn't be what it is, and I imagine it wouldn't be so good; putting it as modestly as I can, it wouldn't be what it is if I'd been born in England, and it wouldn't be what it is if I'd stayed in America. It's a combination of things.

He himself wrote in his 1940 essay on W.B. Yeats: \"The kind of poetry that I needed to teach me the use of my own voice did not exist in English at all; it was only to be found in French.\" (\"Yeats\", ''On Poetry and Poets'', 1948).\n\n===''The Love Song of J.

Before the poem's publication as a book in December 1922, Eliot distanced himself from its vision of despair. On 15 November 1922, he wrote to [[Richard Aldington]], saying, \"As for ''The Waste Land'', that is a thing of the past so far as I am concerned and I am now feeling toward a new form and style.\"<ref>''The Letters of T. S. Eliot'', Vol.&nbsp;1, p.&nbsp;596.</ref> The poem is often read as a representation of the disillusionment of the post-war generation. Dismissing this view, Eliot commented in 1931, \"When I wrote a poem called ''The Waste Land'', some of the more approving critics said that I had expressed \u2018the disillusion of a generation\u2019, which is nonsense. I may have expressed for them their own illusion of being disillusioned, but that did not form part of my intention\"<ref>''The Poems of T.S. Eliot, Volume 1: Collected & Uncollected Poems''. Edited by Christopher Ricks and Jim McCue, Faber & Faber, 2015, p. 576</ref>\n\nThe poem is known for its obscure nature\u2014its slippage between satire and prophecy; its abrupt changes of speaker, location, and time. This structural complexity is one of the reasons why the poem has become a touchstone of [[Modernist poetry in English|modern literature]], a poetic counterpart to a novel published in the same year, [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''.<ref>MacCabe, Colin. ''T. S. Eliot''. Tavistock: Northcote House, 2006.</ref>\n\nAmong its best-known phrases are \"April is the cruellest month\", \"I will show you fear in a handful of dust\" and ''\"[[Shanti Mantra|Shantih shantih shantih]]\"''. The Sanskrit ''[[mantra]]'' ends the poem.\n\n===''The Hollow Men''===\n{{Main|The Hollow Men|The Hollow Men in popular culture}}\n''The Hollow Men'' appeared in 1925.

Published in 1930, it deals with the struggle that ensues when one who has lacked faith acquires it. Sometimes referred to as Eliot's \"conversion poem\", it is richly but ambiguously allusive, and deals with the aspiration to move from spiritual barrenness to hope for human [[salvation]]. Eliot's style of writing in ''Ash-Wednesday'' showed a marked shift from the poetry he had written prior to his 1927 conversion, and his post-conversion style continued in a similar vein. His style became less ironic, and the poems were no longer populated by multiple characters in dialogue. Eliot's subject matter also became more focused on his spiritual concerns and his Christian faith.<ref>Raine, Craig. ''T. S. Eliot'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2006)</ref>\n\nMany critics were particularly enthusiastic about ''Ash-Wednesday''. [[Edwin Muir]] maintained that it is one of the most moving poems Eliot wrote, and perhaps the \"most perfect\", though it was not well received by everyone. The poem's groundwork of orthodox Christianity discomfited many of the more secular ''[[Intellectual|literati]]''.<ref name=EB/><ref name=Untermeyer>[[Louis Untermeyer|Untermeyer, Louis]].

This first edition had an illustration of the author on the cover. In 1954, the composer [[Alan Rawsthorne]] set six of the poems for speaker and orchestra in a work titled ''Practical Cats''. After Eliot's death, the book was adapted as the basis of the musical ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'' by [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], first produced in London's West End in 1981 and opening on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] the following year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/20th-century-literature/articles/an-introduction-to-old-possums-book-of-practical-cats|title=An introduction to Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats|website=The British Library|access-date=27 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n===''Four Quartets''===\n{{Main|Four Quartets}}\nEliot regarded ''Four Quartets'' as his masterpiece, and it is the work that led to his being awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].<ref name=EB/> It consists of four long poems, each first published separately: ''[[Burnt Norton]]'' (1936), ''[[East Coker (poem)|East Coker]]'' (1940), ''[[The Dry Salvages]]'' (1941) and ''[[Little Gidding (poem)|Little Gidding]]'' (1942). Each has five sections. Although they resist easy characterisation, each poem includes meditations on the nature of time in some important respect\u2014[[theological]], historical, physical\u2014and its relation to the human condition. Each poem is associated with one of the four [[classical elements]], respectively: air, earth, water, and fire.\n\n''Burnt Norton'' is a meditative poem that begins with the narrator trying to focus on the present moment while walking through a garden, focusing on images and sounds like the bird, the roses, clouds, and an empty pool. The narrator's meditation leads him/her to reach \"the still point\" in which he doesn't try to get anywhere or to experience place and/or time, instead experiencing \"a grace of sense\". In the final section, the narrator contemplates the arts (\"Words\" and \"music\") as they relate to time. The narrator focuses particularly on the poet's art of manipulating \"Words [which] strain, / Crack and sometimes break, under the burden [of time], under the tension, slip, slide, perish, decay with imprecision, [and] will not stay in place, / Will not stay still.\" By comparison, the narrator concludes that \"Love is itself unmoving, / Only the cause and end of movement, / Timeless, and undesiring.\"\n\n''East Coker'' continues the examination of time and meaning, focusing in a famous passage on the nature of language and poetry. Out of darkness, Eliot offers a solution: \"I said to my soul, be still, and wait without hope.\"\n\n''The Dry Salvages'' treats the element of water, via images of river and sea. It strives to contain opposites: \"The past and future / Are conquered, and reconciled.\"\n\n''Little Gidding'' (the element of fire) is the most anthologised of the Quartets. Eliot's experiences as an air raid warden in [[the Blitz]] power the poem, and he imagines meeting [[Dante]] during the German bombing. The beginning of the Quartets (\"Houses / Are removed, destroyed\") had become a violent everyday experience; this creates an animation, where for the first time he talks of Love as the driving force behind all experience. From this background, the Quartets end with an affirmation of [[Julian of Norwich]]: \"All shall be well and / All manner of thing<!-- NOT \"things\" - Collected Poems, p.209 --> shall be well.\"\n\nThe ''Four Quartets'' cannot be understood without reference to Christian thought, traditions, and history. Eliot draws upon the theology, art, symbolism and language of such figures as Dante, and mystics [[St. John of the Cross]] and [[Julian of Norwich]]. The \"deeper communion\" sought in ''East Coker'', the \"hints and whispers of children, the sickness that must grow worse to find healing\", and the exploration which inevitably leads us home all point to the pilgrim's path along the road of [[sanctification]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n==Plays==\n{{Main|Sweeney Agonistes|Murder in the Cathedral|The Rock (play)|The Family Reunion|The Cocktail Party|The Confidential Clerk|The Elder Statesman}}\nWith the important exception of ''Four Quartets'', Eliot directed much of his creative energies after ''Ash Wednesday'' to writing plays in verse, mostly comedies or plays with redemptive endings. He was long a critic and admirer of [[Elizabethan]] and [[Literature in English#Jacobean literature|Jacobean]] verse drama; witness his allusions to [[John Webster|Webster]], [[Thomas Middleton]], [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Thomas Kyd]] in ''The Waste Land''. In a 1933 lecture he said \"Every poet would like, I fancy, to be able to think that he had some direct social utility . . . . He would like to be something of a popular entertainer and be able to think his own thoughts behind a tragic or a comic mask. He would like to convey the pleasures of poetry, not only to a larger audience but to larger groups of people collectively; and the theatre is the best place in which to do it.\"<ref name=\"upuc\">Eliot, T. S. ''The Use of Poetry and the Use of Criticism'', Harvard University Press, 1933 (penultimate paragraph).</ref>\n\nAfter ''The Waste Land'' (1922), he wrote that he was \"now feeling toward a new form and style\". One project he had in mind was writing a play in verse, using some of the rhythms of early [[jazz]]. The play featured \"Sweeney\", a character who had appeared in a number of his poems. Although Eliot did not finish the play, he did publish two scenes from the piece. These scenes, titled ''Fragment of a Prologue'' (1926) and ''Fragment of an Agon'' (1927), were published together in 1932 as ''[[Sweeney Agonistes]]''. Although Eliot noted that this was not intended to be a one-act play, it is sometimes performed as one.<ref name=Gallup/>\n\nA pageant play by Eliot called ''The Rock'' was performed in 1934 for the benefit of churches in the [[Diocese of London]]. Much of it was a collaborative effort; Eliot accepted credit only for the authorship of one scene and the choruses.<ref name=Gallup/> [[George Bell (bishop)|George Bell]], the [[Bishop of Chichester]], had been instrumental in connecting Eliot with producer [[E. Martin Browne]] for the production of ''The Rock'', and later commissioned Eliot to write another play for the [[Canterbury Festival]] in 1935. This one, ''Murder in the Cathedral'', concerning the death of the martyr, [[Thomas Becket]], was more under Eliot's control. Eliot biographer [[Peter Ackroyd]] comments that \"for [Eliot], ''Murder in the Cathedral'' and succeeding verse plays offered a double advantage; it allowed him to practice poetry but it also offered a convenient home for his religious sensibility.\"<ref name=\"learner.org\"/> After this, he worked on more \"commercial\" plays for more general audiences: ''The Family Reunion'' (1939), ''The Cocktail Party'' (1949), ''The Confidential Clerk'', (1953) and ''The Elder Statesman'' (1958) (the latter three were produced by [[Henry Sherek]] and directed by [[E. Martin Browne]]<ref name=\"Darlington\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/36063|title=Henry Sherek|last=Darlington|first=W.

The Broadway production in New York of ''The Cocktail Party'' received the 1950 [[Tony Award]] for Best Play. Eliot wrote ''The Cocktail Party'' while he was a visiting scholar at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]].<ref>[https://www.ias.edu/files/pdfs/publications/letter-2007-spring.pdf T. S. Eliot at the Institute for Advanced Study], ''The Institute Letter'', Spring 2007, p. 6.</ref><ref>[http://www.ias.edu/people/cos/users/teliot01 Eliot, Thomas Stearns] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150119203650/https://www.ias.edu/people/cos/users/teliot01 |date=19 January 2015 }} IAS profile.</ref>\n\nRegarding his method of playwriting, Eliot explained, \"If I set out to write a play, I start by an act of choice. I settle upon a particular emotional situation, out of which characters and a plot will emerge. And then lines of poetry may come into being: not from the original impulse but from a secondary stimulation of the unconscious mind.\"<ref name=\"learner.org\"/>\n\n==Literary criticism==\nEliot also made significant contributions to the field of [[literary criticism]], strongly influencing the school of [[New Criticism]]. He was somewhat self-deprecating and minimising of his work and once said his criticism was merely a \"by-product\" of his \"private poetry-workshop\" But the critic [[William Empson]] once said, \"I do not know for certain how much of my own mind [Eliot] invented, let alone how much of it is a reaction against him or indeed a consequence of misreading him. He is a very penetrating influence, perhaps not unlike the east wind.\"<ref>quoted in Roger Kimball, \"A Craving for Reality\", ''The New Criterion'' Vol. 18, 1999.</ref>\n\nIn his critical essay \"[[Tradition and the Individual Talent]]\", Eliot argues that art must be understood not in a vacuum, but in the context of previous pieces of art. \"In a peculiar sense [an artist or poet] ... must inevitably be judged by the standards of the past.\"<ref name=bartleby1>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/200/sw4.html |title=Tradition and the Individual Talent|author= Eliot, T. S. |work=The Sacred Wood |publisher=Bartleby.com |year=1930 |accessdate=3 August 2009}}</ref> This essay was an important influence over the New Criticism by introducing the idea that the value of a work of art must be viewed in the context of the artist's previous works, a \"simultaneous order\" of works (i.e., \"tradition\"). Eliot himself employed this concept on many of his works, especially on his long-poem ''The Waste Land''.<ref>[http://www.leidykla.vu.lt/fileadmin/Literatura/51_3/98-108.pdf Dirk Weidmann: ''And I Tiresias have foresuffered all...'']. In: ''LITERATURA'' 51 (3), 2009, pp. 98\u2013108.</ref>\n\nAlso important to New Criticism was the idea\u2014as articulated in Eliot's essay \"[[Hamlet and His Problems]]\"\u2014of an \"[[objective correlative]]\", which posits a connection among the words of the text and events, states of mind, and experiences.<ref name=Hamlet>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/200/sw9.html |title=Hamlet and His Problems|author= Eliot, T. S. |work= The Sacred Wood |publisher=Bartleby.com |year=1921 |accessdate=3 August 2009}}</ref> This notion concedes that a poem means what it says, but suggests that there can be a non-subjective judgment based on different readers' different\u2014but perhaps corollary\u2014interpretations of a work.\n\nMore generally, New Critics took a cue from Eliot in regard to his \"'classical' ideals and his religious thought; his attention to the poetry and drama of the early seventeenth century; his deprecation of the Romantics, especially [[Shelley]]; his proposition that good poems constitute 'not a turning loose of emotion but an escape from emotion'; and his insistence that 'poets... at present must be difficult'.\"<ref>Burt, Steven and Lewin, Jennifer. \"Poetry and the New Criticism\". ''A Companion to Twentieth-Century Poetry'', Neil Roberts, ed. Malden, Massachusetts: Blackwell Publishers, 2001. p. 154</ref>\n\nEliot's essays were a major factor in the revival of interest in the [[metaphysical poets]]. Eliot particularly praised the metaphysical poets' ability to show experience as both psychological and sensual, while at the same time infusing this portrayal with\u2014in Eliot's view\u2014wit and uniqueness. Eliot's essay \"The Metaphysical Poets\", along with giving new significance and attention to metaphysical poetry, introduced his now well-known definition of \"unified sensibility\", which is considered by some to mean the same thing as the term \"metaphysical\".<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_modern_literature/v027/27.1baker.html |title=Project MUSE |publisher=Muse.jhu.edu |accessdate=3 August 2009|doi=10.1353/jml.2004.0051 }}</ref><ref>A.

S. |title=The Waste Land|publisher=Bartleby.com |year= 1922|accessdate=3 August 2009}}</ref> also can be better understood in light of his work as a critic. He had argued that a poet must write \"programmatic criticism\", that is, a poet should write to advance his own interests rather than to advance \"historical scholarship\". Viewed from Eliot's critical lens, ''The Waste Land'' likely shows his personal despair about [[World War I]] rather than an objective historical understanding of it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-2088/TS-Eliot |title=T. S. Eliot :: The Waste Land And Criticism |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |date=4 January 1965 |accessdate=3 August 2009}}</ref>\n\nLate in his career, Eliot focused much of his creative energy on writing for the theatre; some of his earlier critical writing, in essays such as \"Poetry and Drama\",<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/poetryanddrama029231mbp|title=Poetry And Drama|first=T.

S. |year= 1921|work= The Sacred Wood: Essays on Poetry and Criticism|publisher=bartleby.com|accessdate=26 January 2017}}</ref> focused on the aesthetics of writing drama in verse.\n\n==Critical reception==\n\n===Responses to his poetry===\nThe writer Ronald Bush notes that Eliot's early poems like \"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\", \"Portrait of a Lady\", \"La Figlia Che Piange\", \"Preludes\", and \"Rhapsody on a Windy Night\" had \"[an] effect [that] was both unique and compelling, and their assurance staggered [Eliot's] contemporaries who were privileged to read them in manuscript. [Conrad] Aiken, for example, marveled at 'how sharp and complete and [[sui generis]] the whole thing was, from the outset. The wholeness is there, from the very beginning.'\"<ref name=\"english.illinois.edu\" />\n\nThe initial critical response to Eliot's ''The Waste Land'' was mixed. Bush notes that the piece was at first correctly perceived as a work of jazz-like syncopation\u2014and, like 1920s [[jazz]], essentially iconoclastic.\"<ref name=\"english.illinois.edu\"/> Some critics, like [[Edmund Wilson]], [[Conrad Aiken]], and [[Gilbert Seldes]] thought it was the best poetry being written in the English language while others thought it was esoteric and wilfully difficult. Edmund Wilson, being one of the critics who praised Eliot, called him \"one of our only authentic poets\".<ref name=\"Wilson, Edmund 1922\">Wilson, Edmund, \"The Poetry of Drouth\". ''The Dial'' 73. December 1922. 611\u201316.</ref> Wilson also pointed out some of Eliot's weaknesses as a poet. In regard to ''The Waste Land'', Wilson admits its flaws (\"its lack of structural unity\"), but concluded, \"I doubt whether there is a single other poem of equal length by a contemporary American which displays so high and so varied a mastery of English verse.\"<ref name=\"Wilson, Edmund 1922\"/>\n\nCharles Powell was negative in his criticism of Eliot, calling his poems incomprehensible.<ref>Powell, Charles, \"So Much Waste Paper\". ''Manchester Guardian'', 31 October 1923.</ref> And the writers of ''Time'' magazine were similarly baffled by a challenging poem like ''The Waste Land''.<ref>''Time'', 3 March 1923, 12.</ref> [[John Crowe Ransom]] wrote negative criticisms of Eliot's work but also had positive things to say. For instance, though Ransom negatively criticised ''The Waste Land'' for its \"extreme disconnection\", Ransom was not completely condemnatory of Eliot's work and admitted that Eliot was a talented poet.<ref>Ransom, John Crowe. \"Waste Lands\". ''New York Evening Post Literary Review'', 14 July 1923, pp. 825\u201326.</ref>\n\nAddressing some of the common criticisms directed against ''The Waste Land'' at the time, Gilbert Seldes stated, \"It seems at first sight remarkably disconnected and confused... [however] a closer view of the poem does more than illuminate the difficulties; it reveals the hidden form of the work, [and] indicates how each thing falls into place.\"<ref>Seldes, Gilbert. \"T. S. Eliot\". ''Nation'', 6 December 1922. 614\u2013616.</ref>\n\nEliot's reputation as a poet, as well as his influence in the academy, peaked following the publication of ''The Four Quartets''. In an essay on Eliot published in 1989, the writer [[Cynthia Ozick]] refers to this peak of influence (from the 1940s through the early 1960s) as \"the Age of Eliot\" when Eliot \"seemed pure zenith, a colossus, nothing less than a permanent luminary, fixed in the firmament like the sun and the moon\".<ref>{{cite web|first=Cynthia |last=Ozick| url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1989/11/20/t-s-eliot-at-101|title=T.S. ELIOT AT 101|work=The New Yorker|date=20 November 1989|accessdate=1 December 2016}}</ref> But during this post-war period, others, like Ronald Bush, observed that this time also marked the beginning of the decline in Eliot's literary influence: <blockquote>As Eliot's conservative religious and political convictions began to seem less congenial in the postwar world, other readers reacted with suspicion to his assertions of authority, obvious in ''Four Quartets'' and implicit in the earlier poetry. The result, fueled by intermittent rediscovery of Eliot's occasional anti-Semitic rhetoric, has been a progressive downward revision of his once towering reputation.<ref name=\"english.illinois.edu\"/></blockquote> Bush also notes that Eliot's reputation \"slipped\" significantly further after his death. He writes, \"Sometimes regarded as too academic ([[William Carlos Williams]]'s view), Eliot was also frequently criticized for a deadening [[neoclassicism]] (as he himself\u2014perhaps just as unfairly\u2014had criticized [[John Milton|Milton]]). However, the multifarious tributes from practicing poets of many schools published during his centenary in 1988 was a strong indication of the intimidating continued presence of his poetic voice.\"<ref name=\"english.illinois.edu\"/>\n\nAlthough Eliot's poetry is not as influential as it once was, notable literary scholars, like [[Harold Bloom]]<ref>Bloom, Harold. ''The Western Canon: Books and Schools of the Ages''. NY: Riverhead, 1995.</ref> and [[Stephen Greenblatt]],<ref name=Norton>Stephen Greenblatt, et al. (eds), ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature, Volume 2''. \"T.S. Eliot\". New York, NY: W.W. Norton & Co.: NY, NY, 2000.</ref> still acknowledge that Eliot's poetry is central to the literary English canon. For instance, the editors of ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature'' write, \"There is no disagreement on [Eliot's] importance as one of the great renovators of the English poetry dialect, whose influence on a whole generation of poets, critics, and intellectuals generally was enormous. [However] his range as a poet [was] limited, and his interest in the great middle ground of human experience (as distinct from the extremes of saint and sinner) [was] deficient.\" Despite this criticism, these scholars also acknowledge \"[Eliot's] poetic cunning, his fine craftsmanship, his original accent, his historical and representative importance as ''the'' poet of the modern [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolist]]-[[Metaphysical poets|Metaphysical]] tradition\".<ref name=Norton />\n\n===Anti-Semitism===\nThe depiction of Jews in some of Eliot's poems has led several critics to accuse him of [[anti-Semitism]]. This case has been presented most forcefully in a study by [[Anthony Julius]]: ''T. S. Eliot, Anti-Semitism, and Literary Form'' (1996).<ref>[[John Gross|Gross, John]].

Nevertheless, he concluded, \"Ultimately, as both Raine and, to do him justice, Julius insist, however much Eliot may have been compromised as a person, as we all are in our several ways, his greatness as a poet remains.\"<ref name = \"Dean\"/> In another review of Raine's 2006 book, the literary critic [[Terry Eagleton]] also questioned the validity of Raine's defence of Eliot's character flaws as well as the entire basis for Raine's book, writing, \"Why do critics feel a need to defend the authors they write on, like doting parents deaf to all criticism of their obnoxious children? Eliot's well-earned reputation [as a poet] is established beyond all doubt, and making him out to be as unflawed as the [[Gabriel|Archangel Gabriel]] does him no favours.\"<ref>Eagleton, Terry.

It was followed by some of the best-known poems in the English language, including ''[[The Waste Land]]'' (1922), \"[[The Hollow Men]]\" (1925), \"[[Ash Wednesday (poem)|Ash Wednesday]]\" (1930), and ''[[Four Quartets]]'' (1943).<ref name=EB>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/184705/T-S-Eliot \"Thomas Stearns Eliot\"], ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica''.

Eliot's paternal grandfather, [[William Greenleaf Eliot]], had moved to [[St. Louis]], Missouri,<ref name=EB/><ref>Bush, Ronald, ''T. S. Eliot: The Modernist in History'' (New York, 1991), p. 72.</ref> to establish a Unitarian Christian church there. His father, [[Henry Ware Eliot]] (1843\u20131919), was a successful businessman, president and treasurer of the Hydraulic-Press Brick Company in St Louis. His mother, [[Charlotte Champe Stearns]] (1843\u20131929), wrote poetry and was a social worker, a new profession in the early 20th century. Eliot was the last of six surviving children. Known to family and friends as Tom, he was the namesake of his maternal grandfather, Thomas Stearns.\n\nEliot's childhood infatuation with literature can be ascribed to several factors. First, he had to overcome physical limitations as a child. Struggling from a congenital double [[inguinal hernia]], he could not participate in many physical activities and thus was prevented from socialising with his peers. As he was often isolated, his love for literature developed. Once he learned to read, the young boy immediately became obsessed with books, favouring tales of savage life, the Wild West, or [[Mark Twain]]'s thrill-seeking [[Tom Sawyer]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Worthen|first=John|title=T.S. Eliot: A Short Biography|year=2009|publisher=Haus Publishing|location=London|page=9}}</ref> In his memoir of Eliot, his friend Robert Sencourt comments that the young Eliot \"would often curl up in the window-seat behind an enormous book, setting the drug of dreams against the pain of living.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Sencourt|first=Robert|title=T.S. Eliot, A Memoir|year=1971|publisher=Garnstone Limited|location=London|page=18}}</ref> Secondly, Eliot credited his hometown with fuelling his literary vision: \"It is self-evident that St. Louis affected me more deeply than any other environment has ever done. I feel that there is something in having passed one's childhood beside the [[Mississippi River|big river]], which is incommunicable to those people who have not. I consider myself fortunate to have been born here, rather than in Boston, or New York, or London.\"<ref>Letter to Marquis Childs quoted in ''St. Louis Post Dispatch'' (15 October 1930) and in the address \"American Literature and the American Language\" delivered at [[Washington University in St. Louis]] (9 June 1953), published in Washington University Studies, ''New Series: Literature and Language'', no. 23 (St. Louis: Washington University Press, 1953), p. 6.</ref>\n\nFrom 1898 to 1905, Eliot attended [[Mary Institute and St. Louis Country Day School|Smith Academy]], the boys college preparatory division of [[Washington University in St. Louis|Washington University]], where his studies included Latin, Ancient Greek, French, and German. He began to write poetry when he was fourteen under the influence of [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward Fitzgerald]]'s translation of the ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]].''

He first visited [[Marburg]], Germany, where he planned to take a summer programme, but when the [[First World War]] broke out he went to Oxford instead. At the time so many American students attended Merton that the [[Junior Common Room]] proposed a motion \"that this society abhors the [[Americanization]] of Oxford\". It was defeated by two votes after Eliot reminded the students how much they owed American culture.<ref name=SeymourJones1>Seymour-Jones, Carole.

Oxford is very pretty, but I don't like to be dead.\"<ref name=SeymourJones1/> Escaping Oxford, Eliot spent much of his time in London. This city had a monumental and life-altering effect on Eliot for several reasons, the most significant of which was his introduction to the influential American literary figure [[Ezra Pound]]. A connection through Aiken resulted in an arranged meeting and on 22 September 1914, Eliot paid a visit to Pound's flat. Pound instantly deemed Eliot \"worth watching\" and was crucial to Eliot's beginning career as a poet, as he is credited with promoting Eliot through social events and literary gatherings. Thus, according to biographer John Worthen, during his time in England Eliot \"was seeing as little of Oxford as possible\". He was instead spending long periods of time in London, in the company of Ezra Pound and \"some of the modern artists whom the war has so far spared... It was Pound who helped most, introducing him everywhere.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Worthen|first=John|title=T.S.

The couple formally separated in 1933 and in 1938 Vivienne's brother, Maurice, had her committed to a mental hospital, against her will, where she remained until her death of heart disease in 1947. \n\nTheir relationship became the subject of a 1984 play ''[[Tom & Viv (play)|Tom & Viv]]'', which in 1994 was adapted as a film of [[Tom & Viv|the same name]].\n\nIn a private paper written in his sixties, Eliot confessed: \"I came to persuade myself that I was in love with Vivienne simply because I wanted to burn my boats and commit myself to staying in England. And she persuaded herself (also under the influence of [Ezra] Pound) that she would save the poet by keeping him in England. To her, the marriage brought no happiness.

He was aware of this even early in his career. He wrote to J.H. Woods, one of his former Harvard professors, \"My reputation in London is built upon one small volume of verse, and is kept up by printing two or three more poems in a year. The only thing that matters is that these should be perfect in their kind, so that each should be an event.\"<ref>Eliot, T. S. \"Letter to J. H. Woods, April 21, 1919.\" ''The Letters of T. S. Eliot'', vol. I. Valerie Eliot (ed.), New York: Harcourt Brace, 1988, p. 285.</ref>\n\nTypically, Eliot first published his poems individually in periodicals or in small books or pamphlets and then collected them in books. His first collection was ''Prufrock and Other Observations'' (1917). In 1920, he published more poems in ''Ara Vos Prec'' (London) and ''Poems: 1920'' (New York). These had the same poems (in a different order) except that \"Ode\" in the British edition was replaced with \"Hysteria\" in the American edition. In 1925, he collected ''The Waste Land'' and the poems in ''Prufrock'' and ''Poems'' into one volume and added ''The Hollow Men'' to form ''Poems: 1909\u20131925''. From then on, he updated this work as ''Collected Poems''. Exceptions are ''Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats'' (1939), a collection of light verse; ''Poems Written in Early Youth'', posthumously published in 1967 and consisting mainly of poems published between 1907 and 1910 in ''[[The Harvard Advocate]]'', and ''Inventions of the March Hare: Poems 1909\u20131917'', material Eliot never intended to have published, which appeared posthumously in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theworld.com/~raparker/exploring/tseliot/works/poems/eliot-harvard-poems.html |title=T.

That I'm sure of. ... It wouldn't be what it is, and I imagine it wouldn't be so good; putting it as modestly as I can, it wouldn't be what it is if I'd been born in England, and it wouldn't be what it is if I'd stayed in America. It's a combination of things. But in its sources, in its emotional springs, it comes from America.\"<ref name=Hall25>{{cite journal\n |url         = http://www.parisreview.com/media/4738_ELIOT4.pdf\n |title       = The Art of Poetry No. 1\n |author      = Hall, Donald\n |authorlink  = Donald Hall\n |date        = Spring\u2013Summer 1959\n |journal   = The Paris Review\n |accessdate  = 7 November 2009\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20091003162716/http://www.parisreview.com/media/4738_ELIOT4.pdf\n |archivedate = 3 October 2009\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nCleo McNelly Kearns notes in her biography that Eliot was deeply influenced by Indic traditions, notably the [[Upanishads]]. From the Sanskrit ending of ''The Waste Land'' to the \"What Krishna meant\" section of ''Four Quartets'' shows how much Indic religions and more specifically Hinduism made up his philosophical basic for his thought process.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/5912809|title=T.

He himself wrote in his 1940 essay on W.B. Yeats: \"The kind of poetry that I needed to teach me the use of my own voice did not exist in English at all; it was only to be found in French.\" (\"Yeats\", ''On Poetry and Poets'', 1948).\n\n===''The Love Song of J.

Retrieved 23 April 2007.</ref> Although the character Prufrock seems to be middle-aged, Eliot wrote most of the poem when he was only twenty-two. Its now-famous opening lines, comparing the evening sky to \"a patient etherised upon a table\", were considered shocking and offensive, especially at a time when [[Georgian Poetry]] was hailed for its derivations of the nineteenth century [[romanticism|Romantic Poets]].<ref>See, for example, Eliot, T.

Its reception in London can be gauged from an unsigned review in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' on 21 June 1917. \"The fact that these things occurred to the mind of Mr. Eliot is surely of the very smallest importance to anyone, even to himself.

Before the poem's publication as a book in December 1922, Eliot distanced himself from its vision of despair. On 15 November 1922, he wrote to [[Richard Aldington]], saying, \"As for ''The Waste Land'', that is a thing of the past so far as I am concerned and I am now feeling toward a new form and style.\"<ref>''The Letters of T. S. Eliot'', Vol.&nbsp;1, p.&nbsp;596.</ref> The poem is often read as a representation of the disillusionment of the post-war generation. Dismissing this view, Eliot commented in 1931, \"When I wrote a poem called ''The Waste Land'', some of the more approving critics said that I had expressed \u2018the disillusion of a generation\u2019, which is nonsense. I may have expressed for them their own illusion of being disillusioned, but that did not form part of my intention\"<ref>''The Poems of T.S. Eliot, Volume 1: Collected & Uncollected Poems''. Edited by Christopher Ricks and Jim McCue, Faber & Faber, 2015, p. 576</ref>\n\nThe poem is known for its obscure nature\u2014its slippage between satire and prophecy; its abrupt changes of speaker, location, and time. This structural complexity is one of the reasons why the poem has become a touchstone of [[Modernist poetry in English|modern literature]], a poetic counterpart to a novel published in the same year, [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''.<ref>MacCabe, Colin. ''T. S. Eliot''. Tavistock: Northcote House, 2006.</ref>\n\nAmong its best-known phrases are \"April is the cruellest month\", \"I will show you fear in a handful of dust\" and ''\"[[Shanti Mantra|Shantih shantih shantih]]\"''. The Sanskrit ''[[mantra]]'' ends the poem.\n\n===''The Hollow Men''===\n{{Main|The Hollow Men|The Hollow Men in popular culture}}\n''The Hollow Men'' appeared in 1925. For the critic [[Edmund Wilson]], it marked \"The nadir of the phase of despair and desolation given such effective expression in ''The Waste Land''.\"<ref>[[Edmund Wilson|Wilson, Edmund]]. \"Review of Ash Wednesday\", ''New Republic'', 20 August 1930.</ref> It is Eliot's major poem of the late 1920s. Similar to Eliot's other works, its themes are overlapping and fragmentary. Post-war Europe under the [[Treaty of Versailles]] (which Eliot despised), the difficulty of hope and religious conversion, Eliot's failed marriage.<ref>See, for instance, the biographically oriented work of one of Eliot's editors and major critics, Ronald Schuchard.</ref>\n\n[[Allen Tate]] perceived a shift in Eliot's method, writing, \"The mythologies disappear altogether in ''The Hollow Men''.\" This is a striking claim for a poem as indebted to [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] as anything else in Eliot's early work, to say little of the modern English mythology\u2014the \"Old [[Guy Fawkes]]\" of the [[Gunpowder Plot]]\u2014or the colonial and [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] mythos of [[Joseph Conrad]] and [[James George Frazer]], which, at least for reasons of textual history, echo in ''The Waste Land''.<ref>Grant, Michael (ed.).

Published in 1930, it deals with the struggle that ensues when one who has lacked faith acquires it. Sometimes referred to as Eliot's \"conversion poem\", it is richly but ambiguously allusive, and deals with the aspiration to move from spiritual barrenness to hope for human [[salvation]]. Eliot's style of writing in ''Ash-Wednesday'' showed a marked shift from the poetry he had written prior to his 1927 conversion, and his post-conversion style continued in a similar vein. His style became less ironic, and the poems were no longer populated by multiple characters in dialogue. Eliot's subject matter also became more focused on his spiritual concerns and his Christian faith.<ref>Raine, Craig. ''T. S. Eliot'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2006)</ref>\n\nMany critics were particularly enthusiastic about ''Ash-Wednesday''. [[Edwin Muir]] maintained that it is one of the most moving poems Eliot wrote, and perhaps the \"most perfect\", though it was not well received by everyone. The poem's groundwork of orthodox Christianity discomfited many of the more secular ''[[Intellectual|literati]]''.<ref name=EB/><ref name=Untermeyer>[[Louis Untermeyer|Untermeyer, Louis]].

This first edition had an illustration of the author on the cover. In 1954, the composer [[Alan Rawsthorne]] set six of the poems for speaker and orchestra in a work titled ''Practical Cats''. After Eliot's death, the book was adapted as the basis of the musical ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'' by [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], first produced in London's West End in 1981 and opening on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] the following year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/20th-century-literature/articles/an-introduction-to-old-possums-book-of-practical-cats|title=An introduction to Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats|website=The British Library|access-date=27 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n===''Four Quartets''===\n{{Main|Four Quartets}}\nEliot regarded ''Four Quartets'' as his masterpiece, and it is the work that led to his being awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].<ref name=EB/> It consists of four long poems, each first published separately: ''[[Burnt Norton]]'' (1936), ''[[East Coker (poem)|East Coker]]'' (1940), ''[[The Dry Salvages]]'' (1941) and ''[[Little Gidding (poem)|Little Gidding]]'' (1942). Each has five sections. Although they resist easy characterisation, each poem includes meditations on the nature of time in some important respect\u2014[[theological]], historical, physical\u2014and its relation to the human condition. Each poem is associated with one of the four [[classical elements]], respectively: air, earth, water, and fire.\n\n''Burnt Norton'' is a meditative poem that begins with the narrator trying to focus on the present moment while walking through a garden, focusing on images and sounds like the bird, the roses, clouds, and an empty pool. The narrator's meditation leads him/her to reach \"the still point\" in which he doesn't try to get anywhere or to experience place and/or time, instead experiencing \"a grace of sense\". In the final section, the narrator contemplates the arts (\"Words\" and \"music\") as they relate to time. The narrator focuses particularly on the poet's art of manipulating \"Words [which] strain, / Crack and sometimes break, under the burden [of time], under the tension, slip, slide, perish, decay with imprecision, [and] will not stay in place, / Will not stay still.\" By comparison, the narrator concludes that \"Love is itself unmoving, / Only the cause and end of movement, / Timeless, and undesiring.\"\n\n''East Coker'' continues the examination of time and meaning, focusing in a famous passage on the nature of language and poetry. Out of darkness, Eliot offers a solution: \"I said to my soul, be still, and wait without hope.\"\n\n''The Dry Salvages'' treats the element of water, via images of river and sea. It strives to contain opposites: \"The past and future / Are conquered, and reconciled.\"\n\n''Little Gidding'' (the element of fire) is the most anthologised of the Quartets. Eliot's experiences as an air raid warden in [[the Blitz]] power the poem, and he imagines meeting [[Dante]] during the German bombing. The beginning of the Quartets (\"Houses / Are removed, destroyed\") had become a violent everyday experience; this creates an animation, where for the first time he talks of Love as the driving force behind all experience. From this background, the Quartets end with an affirmation of [[Julian of Norwich]]: \"All shall be well and / All manner of thing<!-- NOT \"things\" - Collected Poems, p.209 --> shall be well.\"\n\nThe ''Four Quartets'' cannot be understood without reference to Christian thought, traditions, and history. Eliot draws upon the theology, art, symbolism and language of such figures as Dante, and mystics [[St. John of the Cross]] and [[Julian of Norwich]]. The \"deeper communion\" sought in ''East Coker'', the \"hints and whispers of children, the sickness that must grow worse to find healing\", and the exploration which inevitably leads us home all point to the pilgrim's path along the road of [[sanctification]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n==Plays==\n{{Main|Sweeney Agonistes|Murder in the Cathedral|The Rock (play)|The Family Reunion|The Cocktail Party|The Confidential Clerk|The Elder Statesman}}\nWith the important exception of ''Four Quartets'', Eliot directed much of his creative energies after ''Ash Wednesday'' to writing plays in verse, mostly comedies or plays with redemptive endings. He was long a critic and admirer of [[Elizabethan]] and [[Literature in English#Jacobean literature|Jacobean]] verse drama; witness his allusions to [[John Webster|Webster]], [[Thomas Middleton]], [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Thomas Kyd]] in ''The Waste Land''. In a 1933 lecture he said \"Every poet would like, I fancy, to be able to think that he had some direct social utility . . . . He would like to be something of a popular entertainer and be able to think his own thoughts behind a tragic or a comic mask. He would like to convey the pleasures of poetry, not only to a larger audience but to larger groups of people collectively; and the theatre is the best place in which to do it.\"<ref name=\"upuc\">Eliot, T. S. ''The Use of Poetry and the Use of Criticism'', Harvard University Press, 1933 (penultimate paragraph).</ref>\n\nAfter ''The Waste Land'' (1922), he wrote that he was \"now feeling toward a new form and style\". One project he had in mind was writing a play in verse, using some of the rhythms of early [[jazz]]. The play featured \"Sweeney\", a character who had appeared in a number of his poems. Although Eliot did not finish the play, he did publish two scenes from the piece. These scenes, titled ''Fragment of a Prologue'' (1926) and ''Fragment of an Agon'' (1927), were published together in 1932 as ''[[Sweeney Agonistes]]''. Although Eliot noted that this was not intended to be a one-act play, it is sometimes performed as one.<ref name=Gallup/>\n\nA pageant play by Eliot called ''The Rock'' was performed in 1934 for the benefit of churches in the [[Diocese of London]]. Much of it was a collaborative effort; Eliot accepted credit only for the authorship of one scene and the choruses.<ref name=Gallup/> [[George Bell (bishop)|George Bell]], the [[Bishop of Chichester]], had been instrumental in connecting Eliot with producer [[E. Martin Browne]] for the production of ''The Rock'', and later commissioned Eliot to write another play for the [[Canterbury Festival]] in 1935. This one, ''Murder in the Cathedral'', concerning the death of the martyr, [[Thomas Becket]], was more under Eliot's control. Eliot biographer [[Peter Ackroyd]] comments that \"for [Eliot], ''Murder in the Cathedral'' and succeeding verse plays offered a double advantage; it allowed him to practice poetry but it also offered a convenient home for his religious sensibility.\"<ref name=\"learner.org\"/> After this, he worked on more \"commercial\" plays for more general audiences: ''The Family Reunion'' (1939), ''The Cocktail Party'' (1949), ''The Confidential Clerk'', (1953) and ''The Elder Statesman'' (1958) (the latter three were produced by [[Henry Sherek]] and directed by [[E. Martin Browne]]<ref name=\"Darlington\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/36063|title=Henry Sherek|last=Darlington|first=W.

The Broadway production in New York of ''The Cocktail Party'' received the 1950 [[Tony Award]] for Best Play. Eliot wrote ''The Cocktail Party'' while he was a visiting scholar at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]].<ref>[https://www.ias.edu/files/pdfs/publications/letter-2007-spring.pdf T. S.

I settle upon a particular emotional situation, out of which characters and a plot will emerge. And then lines of poetry may come into being: not from the original impulse but from a secondary stimulation of the unconscious mind.\"<ref name=\"learner.org\"/>\n\n==Literary criticism==\nEliot also made significant contributions to the field of [[literary criticism]], strongly influencing the school of [[New Criticism]]. He was somewhat self-deprecating and minimising of his work and once said his criticism was merely a \"by-product\" of his \"private poetry-workshop\" But the critic [[William Empson]] once said, \"I do not know for certain how much of my own mind [Eliot] invented, let alone how much of it is a reaction against him or indeed a consequence of misreading him. He is a very penetrating influence, perhaps not unlike the east wind.\"<ref>quoted in Roger Kimball, \"A Craving for Reality\", ''The New Criterion'' Vol. 18, 1999.</ref>\n\nIn his critical essay \"[[Tradition and the Individual Talent]]\", Eliot argues that art must be understood not in a vacuum, but in the context of previous pieces of art. \"In a peculiar sense [an artist or poet] ... must inevitably be judged by the standards of the past.\"<ref name=bartleby1>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/200/sw4.html |title=Tradition and the Individual Talent|author= Eliot, T. S. |work=The Sacred Wood |publisher=Bartleby.com |year=1930 |accessdate=3 August 2009}}</ref> This essay was an important influence over the New Criticism by introducing the idea that the value of a work of art must be viewed in the context of the artist's previous works, a \"simultaneous order\" of works (i.e., \"tradition\"). Eliot himself employed this concept on many of his works, especially on his long-poem ''The Waste Land''.<ref>[http://www.leidykla.vu.lt/fileadmin/Literatura/51_3/98-108.pdf Dirk Weidmann: ''And I Tiresias have foresuffered all...'']. In: ''LITERATURA'' 51 (3), 2009, pp. 98\u2013108.</ref>\n\nAlso important to New Criticism was the idea\u2014as articulated in Eliot's essay \"[[Hamlet and His Problems]]\"\u2014of an \"[[objective correlative]]\", which posits a connection among the words of the text and events, states of mind, and experiences.<ref name=Hamlet>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/200/sw9.html |title=Hamlet and His Problems|author= Eliot, T. S. |work= The Sacred Wood |publisher=Bartleby.com |year=1921 |accessdate=3 August 2009}}</ref> This notion concedes that a poem means what it says, but suggests that there can be a non-subjective judgment based on different readers' different\u2014but perhaps corollary\u2014interpretations of a work.\n\nMore generally, New Critics took a cue from Eliot in regard to his \"'classical' ideals and his religious thought; his attention to the poetry and drama of the early seventeenth century; his deprecation of the Romantics, especially [[Shelley]]; his proposition that good poems constitute 'not a turning loose of emotion but an escape from emotion'; and his insistence that 'poets... at present must be difficult'.\"<ref>Burt, Steven and Lewin, Jennifer. \"Poetry and the New Criticism\". ''A Companion to Twentieth-Century Poetry'', Neil Roberts, ed. Malden, Massachusetts: Blackwell Publishers, 2001. p. 154</ref>\n\nEliot's essays were a major factor in the revival of interest in the [[metaphysical poets]]. Eliot particularly praised the metaphysical poets' ability to show experience as both psychological and sensual, while at the same time infusing this portrayal with\u2014in Eliot's view\u2014wit and uniqueness. Eliot's essay \"The Metaphysical Poets\", along with giving new significance and attention to metaphysical poetry, introduced his now well-known definition of \"unified sensibility\", which is considered by some to mean the same thing as the term \"metaphysical\".<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_modern_literature/v027/27.1baker.html |title=Project MUSE |publisher=Muse.jhu.edu |accessdate=3 August 2009|doi=10.1353/jml.2004.0051 }}</ref><ref>A.

He had argued that a poet must write \"programmatic criticism\", that is, a poet should write to advance his own interests rather than to advance \"historical scholarship\". Viewed from Eliot's critical lens, ''The Waste Land'' likely shows his personal despair about [[World War I]] rather than an objective historical understanding of it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-2088/TS-Eliot |title=T.

Eliot :: The Waste Land And Criticism |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |date=4 January 1965 |accessdate=3 August 2009}}</ref>\n\nLate in his career, Eliot focused much of his creative energy on writing for the theatre; some of his earlier critical writing, in essays such as \"Poetry and Drama\",<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/poetryanddrama029231mbp|title=Poetry And Drama|first=T. S.|last=Eliot|date=1 January 2000|publisher=Faber And Faber Limited.|accessdate=26 January 2017|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> \"Hamlet and his Problems\",<ref name=Hamlet /> and \"The Possibility of a Poetic Drama\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/200/sw5.html|title=The Possibility of a Poetic Drama|author= Eliot, T. S. |year= 1921|work= The Sacred Wood: Essays on Poetry and Criticism|publisher=bartleby.com|accessdate=26 January 2017}}</ref> focused on the aesthetics of writing drama in verse.\n\n==Critical reception==\n\n===Responses to his poetry===\nThe writer Ronald Bush notes that Eliot's early poems like \"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\", \"Portrait of a Lady\", \"La Figlia Che Piange\", \"Preludes\", and \"Rhapsody on a Windy Night\" had \"[an] effect [that] was both unique and compelling, and their assurance staggered [Eliot's] contemporaries who were privileged to read them in manuscript. [Conrad] Aiken, for example, marveled at 'how sharp and complete and [[sui generis]] the whole thing was, from the outset. The wholeness is there, from the very beginning.'\"<ref name=\"english.illinois.edu\" />\n\nThe initial critical response to Eliot's ''The Waste Land'' was mixed. Bush notes that the piece was at first correctly perceived as a work of jazz-like syncopation\u2014and, like 1920s [[jazz]], essentially iconoclastic.\"<ref name=\"english.illinois.edu\"/> Some critics, like [[Edmund Wilson]], [[Conrad Aiken]], and [[Gilbert Seldes]] thought it was the best poetry being written in the English language while others thought it was esoteric and wilfully difficult. Edmund Wilson, being one of the critics who praised Eliot, called him \"one of our only authentic poets\".<ref name=\"Wilson, Edmund 1922\">Wilson, Edmund, \"The Poetry of Drouth\". ''The Dial'' 73. December 1922. 611\u201316.</ref> Wilson also pointed out some of Eliot's weaknesses as a poet. In regard to ''The Waste Land'', Wilson admits its flaws (\"its lack of structural unity\"), but concluded, \"I doubt whether there is a single other poem of equal length by a contemporary American which displays so high and so varied a mastery of English verse.\"<ref name=\"Wilson, Edmund 1922\"/>\n\nCharles Powell was negative in his criticism of Eliot, calling his poems incomprehensible.<ref>Powell, Charles, \"So Much Waste Paper\". ''Manchester Guardian'', 31 October 1923.</ref> And the writers of ''Time'' magazine were similarly baffled by a challenging poem like ''The Waste Land''.<ref>''Time'', 3 March 1923, 12.</ref> [[John Crowe Ransom]] wrote negative criticisms of Eliot's work but also had positive things to say. For instance, though Ransom negatively criticised ''The Waste Land'' for its \"extreme disconnection\", Ransom was not completely condemnatory of Eliot's work and admitted that Eliot was a talented poet.<ref>Ransom, John Crowe. \"Waste Lands\". ''New York Evening Post Literary Review'', 14 July 1923, pp. 825\u201326.</ref>\n\nAddressing some of the common criticisms directed against ''The Waste Land'' at the time, Gilbert Seldes stated, \"It seems at first sight remarkably disconnected and confused... [however] a closer view of the poem does more than illuminate the difficulties; it reveals the hidden form of the work, [and] indicates how each thing falls into place.\"<ref>Seldes, Gilbert. \"T. S. Eliot\". ''Nation'', 6 December 1922. 614\u2013616.</ref>\n\nEliot's reputation as a poet, as well as his influence in the academy, peaked following the publication of ''The Four Quartets''. In an essay on Eliot published in 1989, the writer [[Cynthia Ozick]] refers to this peak of influence (from the 1940s through the early 1960s) as \"the Age of Eliot\" when Eliot \"seemed pure zenith, a colossus, nothing less than a permanent luminary, fixed in the firmament like the sun and the moon\".<ref>{{cite web|first=Cynthia |last=Ozick| url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1989/11/20/t-s-eliot-at-101|title=T.S. ELIOT AT 101|work=The New Yorker|date=20 November 1989|accessdate=1 December 2016}}</ref> But during this post-war period, others, like Ronald Bush, observed that this time also marked the beginning of the decline in Eliot's literary influence: <blockquote>As Eliot's conservative religious and political convictions began to seem less congenial in the postwar world, other readers reacted with suspicion to his assertions of authority, obvious in ''Four Quartets'' and implicit in the earlier poetry. The result, fueled by intermittent rediscovery of Eliot's occasional anti-Semitic rhetoric, has been a progressive downward revision of his once towering reputation.<ref name=\"english.illinois.edu\"/></blockquote> Bush also notes that Eliot's reputation \"slipped\" significantly further after his death. He writes, \"Sometimes regarded as too academic ([[William Carlos Williams]]'s view), Eliot was also frequently criticized for a deadening [[neoclassicism]] (as he himself\u2014perhaps just as unfairly\u2014had criticized [[John Milton|Milton]]). However, the multifarious tributes from practicing poets of many schools published during his centenary in 1988 was a strong indication of the intimidating continued presence of his poetic voice.\"<ref name=\"english.illinois.edu\"/>\n\nAlthough Eliot's poetry is not as influential as it once was, notable literary scholars, like [[Harold Bloom]]<ref>Bloom, Harold. ''The Western Canon: Books and Schools of the Ages''. NY: Riverhead, 1995.</ref> and [[Stephen Greenblatt]],<ref name=Norton>Stephen Greenblatt, et al. (eds), ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature, Volume 2''. \"T.S. Eliot\". New York, NY: W.W. Norton & Co.: NY, NY, 2000.</ref> still acknowledge that Eliot's poetry is central to the literary English canon. For instance, the editors of ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature'' write, \"There is no disagreement on [Eliot's] importance as one of the great renovators of the English poetry dialect, whose influence on a whole generation of poets, critics, and intellectuals generally was enormous. [However] his range as a poet [was] limited, and his interest in the great middle ground of human experience (as distinct from the extremes of saint and sinner) [was] deficient.\" Despite this criticism, these scholars also acknowledge \"[Eliot's] poetic cunning, his fine craftsmanship, his original accent, his historical and representative importance as ''the'' poet of the modern [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolist]]-[[Metaphysical poets|Metaphysical]] tradition\".<ref name=Norton />\n\n===Anti-Semitism===\nThe depiction of Jews in some of Eliot's poems has led several critics to accuse him of [[anti-Semitism]]. This case has been presented most forcefully in a study by [[Anthony Julius]]: ''T. S. Eliot, Anti-Semitism, and Literary Form'' (1996).<ref>[[John Gross|Gross, John]].

S. Eliot'' (2001) and ''T. S. Eliot'' (2006), sought to defend Eliot from the charge of anti-Semitism. Reviewing the 2006 book, Paul Dean stated that he was not convinced by Raine's argument. Nevertheless, he concluded, \"Ultimately, as both Raine and, to do him justice, Julius insist, however much Eliot may have been compromised as a person, as we all are in our several ways, his greatness as a poet remains.\"<ref name = \"Dean\"/> In another review of Raine's 2006 book, the literary critic [[Terry Eagleton]] also questioned the validity of Raine's defence of Eliot's character flaws as well as the entire basis for Raine's book, writing, \"Why do critics feel a need to defend the authors they write on, like doting parents deaf to all criticism of their obnoxious children? Eliot's well-earned reputation [as a poet] is established beyond all doubt, and making him out to be as unflawed as the [[Gabriel|Archangel Gabriel]] does him no favours.\"<ref>Eagleton, Terry.

At the height of its success in 2007, the party had one Member of Parliament (MP) in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and nineteen councillors in [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local government]].\n\nThe Respect Party was established in London by [[Salma Yaqoob]] and [[George Monbiot]] in 2004. Arising in the aftermath of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], it grew out of the [[Stop the War Coalition]] and from the start revolved largely around opposition to the United Kingdom's role in the [[Iraq War]]. Uniting a range of leftist and anti-war groups, it was unofficially allied to the [[Muslim Association of Britain]] (MAB) and the [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party]] (SWP), a far-left, [[Marxism|Marxist]] group. In [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005]], Respect's candidate [[George Galloway]] was elected MP for [[Bethnal Green and Bow (UK Parliament constituency)|Bethnal Green and Bow]], and the party came second in three other constituencies. Respect made further gains in the 2006 and 2007 local elections, at which point its support peaked. In 2007, a schism emerged in the party between SWP supporters and the [[Respect Renewal]] group led by Galloway and Yaqoob; the former group left the party to form the [[Left List]]. Over the coming years, Respect gradually lost its council seats and it deregistered with the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] in 2016.\n\nAvowedly socialist and opposed to [[capitalism]], Respect called for the nationalisation of much of the UK economy, increased funding to public services, and further measures to tackle poverty and discrimination. It was [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] and promoted an [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] worldview. It was also [[Anti-Zionism|anti-Zionist]], opposing the existence of Israel and endorsing the Palestinian solidarity movement. Due to its links with MAB, several commentators claimed that [[Islamism]] was a component of its ideology and regarded it as part of a wider alliance between socialists and Islamists within [[Western Europe]]. Respect's voting base was primarily among the British Muslim communities in [[East London]], [[Birmingham]] and [[Bradford]], where it built upon opposition to the [[Iraq War]] and disenchantment among leftist voters with the governing [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].\n\n==Ideology==\nThe political scientists [[Matthew Goodwin]] and Robert Ford characterised Respect as a \"broad coalition of left-wing interests\" which had arisen in opposition to the [[New Labour]] government and the UK's involvement in the invasion of Iraq.{{sfn|Ford|Goodwin|2014|p=238}} Other political scientists characterised the party as [[far-left]].{{sfnm|1a1=Benedek|1y=2007|1p=154|2a1=Clark|2y=2012|2p=112}} The socialist activist [[Tariq Ali]] characterised the party's programme as being [[social democracy|social democratic]] in orientation.<ref>{{cite news |last=Ali |first=Tariq |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/31/george-galloway-respect-tariq-ali |title=George Galloway's Respect could help Britain to break the political impasse |work=The Guardian |date=31 March 2012 |accessdate=4 March 2016}}</ref> Eran Benedek described the party as \"an amalgamation of radical international socialism and Islamism\",{{sfn|Benedek|2007|p=153}} adding that its radical socialist position was informed by [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]] and [[Trotskyism]].{{sfn|Benedek|2007|p=155}} Benedek characterised it as a manifestation of what [[Amir Taheri]] called the \"Marxist-Islamist coalition\" which united around opposition to the United States, a desire to destroy the state of Israel, and a wish to overthrow international capitalism.{{sfn|Benedek|2007|p=155}} Similarly, Emmanuel Karagiannis characterised the party as \"the epitome\" of the \"convergence\" between radical left and Islamist groups in Western Europe.{{sfn|Karagiannis|2012|p=209}}\n\n===Socialism and anti-capitalism===\nThe party's policies have been described as \"traditionally leftist and anti-capitalist\".{{sfn|Driver|2011|p=158}}\nRespect encouraged the nationalisation of many sectors of the economy, including the railways, water, gas, electricity, and the [[North Sea oil]] industry.{{sfn|Clark|2012|p=112}} It urged a substantial increase in [[corporation tax]] in order to increase funding to public services.{{sfn|Clark|2012|p=112}} It sought to overturn what it described as \"anti-trade union\" legislation,{{sfn|Driver|2011|p=158}} and to introduce policies to deal with issues of poverty and discrimination.{{sfn|Clark|2012|p=112}} Respect promoted [[revolutionary socialism]] and [[international socialism]].{{sfn|Benedek|2007|p=154}} The party was largely hostile to Western [[capitalism]] and [[neoliberalism]], and interpreted many world events through the prism of [[anti-imperialism]],{{sfn|Benedek|2007|pp=154, 155}} calling for an end to what it characterised as imperialist wars like that in Iraq.{{sfn|Driver|2011|p=158}} Respect was [[anti-globalization]], believing that it resulted in the exploitation of the working class.{{sfn|Clark|2012|p=112}} It also expressed a [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] approach to the [[European Union]], deeming the Union to be lacking in democracy and exploitative toward the working class.{{sfn|Clark|2012|p=112}}\n\n===Anti-Zionism===\nRespect was [[Anti-Zionism|anti-Zionist]] and rejected the state of Israel's right to exist.{{sfn|Benedek|2007|pp=153, 154}} It presented this position through the terminology of [[social justice]] and [[human rights]].{{sfn|Benedek|2007|p=156}} One of its core principles was stated support for the [[Palestinian people]] and opposition to what Respect described as \"the apartheid system that oppresses them\".{{sfn|Benedek|2007|p=155}} It was constitutionally committed to supporting the [[Palestine Solidarity Campaign]] and the boycotting of Israel.{{sfn|Benedek|2007|p=155}} It calls for Israel to withdraw from any land conquered in 1967, and for the right of return to be granted to all Palestinians forced to move on the formation of the state of Israel in 1948.{{sfn|Benedek|2007|p=156}} On its website and published fliers, it included maps of the [[Levant]] in which the entirety of Israel was labelled \"Occupied Palestine\".{{sfn|Benedek|2007|p=157}} In 2017, the party's website asserts: \"Respect supports the idea of a democratic bi-national solution of one state from the [[Jordan River]] to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in which all people, Jews, Muslims and Christians live equally; one man, one woman, one vote\" and says British foreign policy should recognise Britain's \"partial responsibility for the problem by their participation in the creation of the state of Israel\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.respectparty.org/international/arab-world/|title=Arab World|publisher=Respect Party |accessdate=3 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the party's national council member [[Yvonne Ridley]], speaking at London's [[Imperial College London|Imperial College]] in February 2006, Respect \"is a Zionist-free party... if there was any Zionism in the Respect Party they would be hunted down and kicked out.\"{{sfn|Benedek|2007|p=156}}<ref>{{cite news |last=Das |first=Shamik |url=https://leftfootforward.org/2012/11/yvonne-ridley-respect-rotherham-hamas/ |title=Yvonne Ridley: Says Zionists should be \"hunted down\";

A local election flyer printed in 2004 featured the slogan \"George Galloway \u2013 Fighting for Muslim Rights!\" It often fielded Muslim candidates to stand in largely Muslim areas, although this was not unusual in British politics, with Labour, the Conservatives, and the Liberal Democrats often doing the same.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|pp=415-17}}\n\nRespect's main electoral support base was in East London and Birmingham. However, there were other areas of Britain with large Islamic communities\u2014such as [[Yorkshire]], [[Lancashire]], and [[Leicester]]\u2014where the party did not do well. Peace suggested that Respect had been successful in East London and Birmingham and not other areas with Muslim communities because these two areas had established anti-war movements and that Respect candidates had already become well known within that movement.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|pp=415-16}}\n\nIt has also been suggested that Respect's connection to religious groups and [[mosques]] has been crucial to the party's success in many areas.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|pp=418\u2013419}} It attracted some controversy for allegedly being tied to the [[Islamic Forum of Europe]] (IFE), a group based at the [[East London Mosque]] in Tower Hamlets.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=419}} Both ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' and ''[[Dispatches (TV series)|Dispatches]]'' have alleged that Respect activist Miah is an IFE member, although he has denied this.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=419}}<ref name=\"Gilligan22102010\">Andrew Gilligan [http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/andrewgilligan/100060409/britains-islamic-republic-full-transcript-of-channel-4-dispatches-programme-on-lutfur-rahman-the-ife-and-tower-hamlets-the-full-transcript \"'Britain's Islamic republic': full transcript of Channel 4 Dispatches programme on Lutfur Rahman, the IFE and Tower Hamlets\"], ''Daily Telegraph'', 22 October 2010.</ref><ref>Andrew Gilligan [http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/andrewgilligan/100111564/ife-becomes-three-time-loser-in-the-complaint-stakes \"The Islamic Forum of Europe becomes a three-time loser in the complaint stakes\"], ''Daily Telegraph'', 19 October 2011.</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nRespect received little attention from scholars of politics.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|pp=405\u2013406}} This may be due to the perception that it was a single-issue party that provided a protest vote among a particular community.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=406}}\nAs with the Greens, Respect were recognised as having radical views but were nonetheless widely regarded as a legitimate part of politics in the UK.

At the height of its success in 2007, the party had one Member of Parliament (MP) in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and nineteen councillors in [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local government]].\n\nThe Respect Party was established in London by [[Salma Yaqoob]] and [[George Monbiot]] in 2004. Arising in the aftermath of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], it grew out of the [[Stop the War Coalition]] and from the start revolved largely around opposition to the United Kingdom's role in the [[Iraq War]]. Uniting a range of leftist and anti-war groups, it was unofficially allied to the [[Muslim Association of Britain]] (MAB) and the [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party]] (SWP), a far-left, [[Marxism|Marxist]] group. In [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005]], Respect's candidate [[George Galloway]] was elected MP for [[Bethnal Green and Bow (UK Parliament constituency)|Bethnal Green and Bow]], and the party came second in three other constituencies. Respect made further gains in the 2006 and 2007 local elections, at which point its support peaked. In 2007, a schism emerged in the party between SWP supporters and the [[Respect Renewal]] group led by Galloway and Yaqoob; the former group left the party to form the [[Left List]]. Over the coming years, Respect gradually lost its council seats and it deregistered with the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] in 2016.\n\nAvowedly socialist and opposed to [[capitalism]], Respect called for the nationalisation of much of the UK economy, increased funding to public services, and further measures to tackle poverty and discrimination. It was [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] and promoted an [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] worldview. It was also [[Anti-Zionism|anti-Zionist]], opposing the existence of Israel and endorsing the Palestinian solidarity movement. Due to its links with MAB, several commentators claimed that [[Islamism]] was a component of its ideology and regarded it as part of a wider alliance between socialists and Islamists within Western Europe. Respect's voting base was primarily among the British Muslim communities in [[East London]], [[Birmingham]] and [[Bradford]], where it built upon opposition to the Iraq War and disenchantment among leftist voters with the governing [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].\n\n==Ideology==\nThe political scientists [[Matthew Goodwin]] and Robert Ford characterised Respect as a \"broad coalition of left-wing interests\" which had arisen in opposition to the [[New Labour]] government and the UK's involvement in the invasion of Iraq.{{sfn|Ford|Goodwin|2014|p=238}} Other political scientists characterised the party as [[far-left]].{{sfnm|1a1=Benedek|1y=2007|1p=154|2a1=Clark|2y=2012|2p=112}} The socialist activist [[Tariq Ali]] characterised the party's programme as being [[social democracy|social democratic]] in orientation.<ref>{{cite news |last=Ali |first=Tariq |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/31/george-galloway-respect-tariq-ali |title=George Galloway's Respect could help Britain to break the political impasse |work=The Guardian |date=31 March 2012 |accessdate=4 March 2016}}</ref> Eran Benedek described the party as \"an amalgamation of radical international socialism and Islamism\",{{sfn|Benedek|2007|p=153}} adding that its radical socialist position was informed by [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]] and [[Trotskyism]].{{sfn|Benedek|2007|p=155}} Benedek characterised it as a manifestation of what [[Amir Taheri]] called the \"Marxist-Islamist coalition\" which united around opposition to the United States, a desire to destroy the state of Israel, and a wish to overthrow international capitalism.{{sfn|Benedek|2007|p=155}} Similarly, Emmanuel Karagiannis characterised the party as \"the epitome\" of the \"convergence\" between radical left and Islamist groups in Western Europe.{{sfn|Karagiannis|2012|p=209}}\n\n===Socialism and anti-capitalism===\nThe party's policies have been described as \"traditionally leftist and anti-capitalist\".{{sfn|Driver|2011|p=158}}\nRespect encouraged the nationalisation of many sectors of the economy, including the railways, water, gas, electricity, and the [[North Sea oil]] industry.{{sfn|Clark|2012|p=112}} It urged a substantial increase in [[corporation tax]] in order to increase funding to public services.{{sfn|Clark|2012|p=112}} It sought to overturn what it described as \"anti-trade union\" legislation,{{sfn|Driver|2011|p=158}} and to introduce policies to deal with issues of poverty and discrimination.{{sfn|Clark|2012|p=112}} Respect promoted [[revolutionary socialism]] and [[international socialism]].{{sfn|Benedek|2007|p=154}} The party was largely hostile to Western [[capitalism]] and [[neoliberalism]], and interpreted many world events through the prism of [[anti-imperialism]],{{sfn|Benedek|2007|pp=154, 155}} calling for an end to what it characterised as imperialist wars like that in Iraq.{{sfn|Driver|2011|p=158}} Respect was [[anti-globalization]], believing that it resulted in the exploitation of the working class.{{sfn|Clark|2012|p=112}} It also expressed a [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] approach to the [[European Union]], deeming the Union to be lacking in democracy and exploitative toward the working class.{{sfn|Clark|2012|p=112}}\n\n===Anti-Zionism===\nRespect was [[Anti-Zionism|anti-Zionist]] and rejected the state of Israel's right to exist.{{sfn|Benedek|2007|pp=153, 154}} It presented this position through the terminology of [[social justice]] and [[human rights]].{{sfn|Benedek|2007|p=156}} One of its core principles was stated support for the [[Palestinian people]] and opposition to what Respect described as \"the apartheid system that oppresses them\".{{sfn|Benedek|2007|p=155}} It was constitutionally committed to supporting the [[Palestine Solidarity Campaign]] and the boycotting of Israel.{{sfn|Benedek|2007|p=155}} It calls for Israel to withdraw from any land conquered in 1967, and for the right of return to be granted to all Palestinians forced to move on the formation of the state of Israel in 1948.{{sfn|Benedek|2007|p=156}} On its website and published fliers, it included maps of the [[Levant]] in which the entirety of Israel was labelled \"Occupied Palestine\".{{sfn|Benedek|2007|p=157}} In 2017, the party's website asserts: \"Respect supports the idea of a democratic bi-national solution of one state from the [[Jordan River]] to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in which all people, Jews, Muslims and Christians live equally;

The production of balut depends on egg maturation cycles, where the egg begins developing and changes in texture. Throughout these various maturation periods, different temperatures are required to accentuate the specific egg and embryo characteristics. Within the first few stages of maturation, balut is known as \"balut sa puti\" (\"wrapped in white\") when it is white; the embryo inside is insufficiently developed to show a beak, feathers or claws, and the bones are undeveloped.

The production of balut depends on egg maturation cycles, where the egg begins developing and changes in texture. Throughout these various maturation periods, different temperatures are required to accentuate the specific egg and embryo characteristics. Within the first few stages of maturation, balut is known as \"balut sa puti\" (\"wrapped in white\") when it is white; the embryo inside is insufficiently developed to show a beak, feathers or claws, and the bones are undeveloped.

It is said that an early form of balut was brought by Chinese traders and migrants to the Philippines; the Chinese may have sparked the interest and excitement for the Philippines' love of balut. It is commonly sold as a street food and served as an appetizer in restaurants. The taste of balut is similar to chicken soup. It has an unusual texture. \n\nBalut is found in some countries and locations of North America. While it cannot be found in every store in North America, specialty stores such as T&T, and in particular, Filipino stores in the Greater Vancouver area, often sell balut.<ref name=\":9\">{{cite web |title=Best balut in Vancouver.
