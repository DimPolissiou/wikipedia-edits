The remaining members of the complex isolated from rice and a variety of other hosts have been renamed '''''Magnaporthe oryzae'''''. Confusion on which of these two names to use for the rice blast pathogen remains, as both are now used by different authors.\n\nMembers of the ''Magnaporthe grisea'' complex can also infect other agriculturally important [[cereal]]s including [[wheat]], [[rye]], [[barley]], and [[pearl millet]] causing diseases called '''blast disease''' or '''blight disease'''. Rice blast causes economically significant crop losses annually. Each year it is estimated to destroy enough rice to feed more than 60 million people. The fungus is known to occur in 85 countries worldwide.<ref name=\"California\" />\n\n==Hosts and symptoms==\n[[Image:Rice blast.jpg|left|thumb|95px|Lesions on rice leaves caused by infection with ''M. grisea'']][[Image:Rice blast symptoms.jpg|right|thumb|185px|Rice blast lesions on plant nodes]] \n''M. grisea'' is an [[Ascomycota|ascomycete]] fungus. It is an extremely effective plant pathogen as it can reproduce both sexually and asexually to produce specialized infectious structures known as [[appressorium|appressoria]] that infect aerial tissues and hyphae that can infect [[root]] tissues.\n\nRice blast has been observed on rice strains M-201, M-202, M-204, M-205, M-103, M-104, S-102, L-204, Calmochi-101, with M-201 being the most vulnerable.<ref>[http://www.ipm.ucdavis.edu/PMG/r682100611.html Rice Blast] at University of California Integrated Pest Management</ref>  Initial symptoms are white to gray-green lesions or spots with darker borders produced on all parts of the shoot, while older lesions are elliptical or spindle-shaped and whitish to gray with necrotic borders. Lesions may enlarge and coalesce to kill the entire leaf. Symptoms are observed on all above-ground parts of the plant.<ref>[http://www.oisat.org/pests/diseases/fungal/rice_blast.html Rice Blast] at the Online Information Service for Non-Chemical Pest Management in the Tropics</ref>  Lesions can be seen on the [[leaf collar]], [[culm (botany)|culm]], culm nodes, and [[panicle]] neck node. Internodal infection of the culm occurs in a banded pattern. Nodal infection causes the culm to break at the infected node (rotten neck).<ref>[http://www.cbwinfo.com/Biological/PlantPath/PyG.html Rice Blast] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101020063252/http://cbwinfo.com/Biological/PlantPath/PyG.html |date=2010-10-20 }} at Factsheets on Chemical and Biological Warfare Agents</ref>  It also affects reproduction by causing the host to produce fewer seeds. This is caused by the disease preventing maturation of the actual grain.<ref name=\"California\" />\n\n==Disease cycle==\n[[File:Rice blast spores.jpg|thumb|left|195px| Spores of ''M. grisea'']]\nThe pathogen infects as a spore that produces lesions or spots on parts of the rice plant such as the leaf, leaf collar, panicle, culm and culm nodes. Using a structure called an [[appressorium]], the pathogen penetrates the plant. The pathogen is able to move between the plant cells using its invasive hyphae to enter through plasmodesmata.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sakulkoo |first1=Wasin |last2=Os\u00e9s-Ruiz |first2=Miriam |last3=Oliveira Garcia |first3=Ely |last4=Soanes |first4=Darren |last5=Littlejohn |first5=George |last6=Hacker |first6=Christian |last7=Correia |first7=Ana |last8=Valent |first8=Barbara |last9=Talbot |first9=Nicholas |title=A single fungal MAP kinase controls plant cell-to-cell invasion by the rice blast fungus |journal=Science |date=23 Mar 2018 |volume=359 |issue=6382 |pages=1399\u20131403 |doi=10.1126/science.aaq0892|pmid=29567712 |doi-access=free }}</ref> ''M. grisea'' then sporulates from the diseased rice tissue to be dispersed as conidiospores.<ref name=\"Agrios\">{{cite book |title=Plant Pathology |first= George N. |last=Agrios |publisher=Elsevier Academic Press |location=Amsterdam |year=2005}}</ref> After overwintering in sources such as rice straw and stubble, the cycle repeats.<ref name=\"California\">{{cite web |url=http://www.plantsciences.ucdavis.edu/uccerice/afs/agfs0297.htm |author= S.C.
