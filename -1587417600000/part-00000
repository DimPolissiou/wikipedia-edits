Neuburg is located on the Danube between [[Ingolstadt]] and [[Donauw\u00f6rth]]. This battle occurred late in the [[War of the Second Coalition]] (1798\u20131802), the second war between [[French First Republic|Revolutionary France]] and the conservative European monarchies, which included at one time or another [[Great Britain|Britain]], [[Austrian monarchy|Habsburg Austria]], [[Russia]] (until late 1799), the [[Ottoman Empire]] (Turkey), [[Portugal]] and [[Naples]]. After a series of reverses, several of the allies withdrew from the Coalition.  By 1800, Napoleon's military victories in northern Italy challenged Habsburg supremacy there.  French victories in the upper Danubian territories opened a route along that river to Vienna.\n\nIn a series of battles in what is now southern Germany, the French pushed the combined Austrian and Coalition force back, first capturing [[Stockach]], then [[Messkirch]], then [[Biberach an der Riss|Biberach]].  After his loss at Biberach, the Coalition commander [[P\u00e1l Kray]] withdrew to the fortress at [[Ulm]], leaving detachments to secure the Danube crossings that lay further to the east, at [[H\u00f6chst\u00e4dt an der Donau|H\u00f6chst\u00e4dt]], [[Blindheim]], Donauw\u00f6rth, and Neuburg. The battle at Neuburg was the last of the Danube campaign for the summer of 1800; the armistice between the Habsburgs and the French was signed a couple of days later and ended in late November, and the French ultimately defeated the Austrians at the battles at [[Battle of Ampfing (1800)|Ampfing]] and [[Battle of Hohenlinden|Hohenlinden]].  The heaviest action of the battle occurred in the village of Unterhausen, in the outskirts of Neuburg.\n\n==Background==\n{{main|French Revolutionary Wars}}\nBy early 1799, the French Directory had become impatient with stalling tactics employed by Austria. The uprising in Naples raised further alarms, and recent gains in Switzerland suggested the timing was fortuitous to venture on another campaign in northern Italy and southwestern Germany.<ref>Timothy Blanning. ''The French Revolutionary Wars,'' New York, Oxford University Press. p. 200.</ref> At the beginning of 1800, the armies of France and Austria faced each other across the Rhine. [[Feldzeugmeister]] P\u00e1l Kray led approximately 120,000 troops. In addition to his Austrian regulars, his force included 12,000 men from the Electorate of Bavaria, 6,000 troops from the [[Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg]], 5,000 soldiers of low quality from the [[Archbishopric of Mainz]], and 7,000 militiamen from the [[County of Tyrol]]. Of these, 25,000 men were deployed east of [[Lake Constance|Lake Constance (Bodensee)]] to protect the [[Vorarlberg]]. Kray posted his main body of 95,000 soldiers in the L-shaped angle where the Rhine changes direction from a westward flow along the northern border of [[Switzerland]] to a northward flow along the eastern border of France. Unwisely, Kray set up his main magazine at Stockach, near the northwestern end of Lake Constance, only a day's march from French-held Switzerland.<ref>James R. Arnold, ''Marengo & Hohenlinden.'' Barnsley, South Yorkshire, UK: Pen & Sword, 2005, pp. 197\u2013199.</ref>\n\n===Strategic importance of Danube Valley===\n\nThe French war goal, to occupy Vienna and force the Habsburgs to accept and comply with peace terms established in 1798, required a double-pronged invasion through northern Italy, which First Consul Napoleon commanded, and through southern Germany, a campaign that fell to Moreau.  To secure access into Bavaria and, eventually, to Vienna, the French needed to control the Danube riverway. This was not a new tactic: The stretch of river between Ulm and Neuburg had been the site of major battles of the [[Thirty Years' War]] and [[War of the Spanish Succession]].  Between Ulm and Ingolstadt, the Danube grows significantly in volume, making it a wide and swift waterway. The [[Iller]] joins the Danube at [[Ulm]], dumping massive amounts of water into the stream; at Donauw\u00f6rth, the Lech enters the Danube. Neuburg, the first significant city on the river after Donauw\u00f6rth, had been the family seat of the princes of [[Pfalz-Neuburg]]; taking it from a princely family of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] would be a blow to the morale and prestige of the Habsburgs, whose role it was to protect the small princely domains. Control of the bridges and passages between Ulm and Donauw\u00f6rth, Neuburg, then Ingolstadt offered an advantage of both transport and prestige.<ref>Andrew Beattie, ''The Danube: A Cultural History.''  Oxford University Press, 2010, pp. 29\u201333.</ref>\n\n===Preliminary to battle===\n\nAfter withdrawing from Biberach, Kray waited at Ulm for Moreau's assault, which did not come. Instead of striking directly at the well-fortified and supplied city, Moreau's first division, approaching Ulm from the south, suddenly veered to the east and struck at the smaller forces posted between Ulm and Donauw\u00f6rth.<ref>David Eggenberger, \"H\u00f6chst\u00e4dt II\", ''An Encyclopedia of Battles'', Dover Publications, 2014, p. 193.</ref>  Its commander, Claude Lecourbe, secured posts in [[Landsberg am Lech|Landsberg]] and [[Augsburg]], and left sufficient rearguard troops to protect himself from [[Prince Heinrich XV of Reuss-Plauen|Prince Reuss-Plauen]], who remained in the Tyrol guarding mountain access to Vienna.  Lecourbe then approached Dettingen, Blindheim (Blenheim) and H\u00f6chst\u00e4dt.  The corps of General [[Paul Grenier]] had been posted with its right flank to the Danube and Gunzburg, and their left flank at Kinsdorf.  General [[Antoine Richepanse|Richepanse]] protected both shores of the [[Iller]], covering the road from Ulm south to [[Memmingen]], and secured communication with Switzerland; there, he withstood considerable skirmishing with the Austrians.  Three divisions of reserve remained at the hamlets of Kamlack and Mindel, to support an attack made by General Lecourbe on Ulm, in a case it should succeed, or Grenier's attack upon [[G\u00fcnzburg]], in case Lecourbe should not succeed. At the battle at [[Battle of H\u00f6chst\u00e4dt (1800)|H\u00f6chst\u00e4dt]], a full Austrian corps maintained possession until dislodged by repeated attacks of [[carabiner]]s, [[cuirassier]]s and [[hussar]]s, who took about 2,000 of the Austrians and W\u00fcrttembergers as prisoners, along with some cannons and standards.<ref>Willem Lodewyk Van-Es, ''The Life of Napoleon Buonaparte ...: With a Concise History of the Events'' W. Day, 1810 \u2013 France, pp. 31\u201335.</ref>  Once H\u00f6chst\u00e4dt and its nearby bridges fell on 19 June, the French controlled the Danube crossings between Ulm and Donauw\u00f6rth. Kray abandoned Ulm, and withdrew further downstream. The next French target would be Neuburg.<ref>Digby Smith, Smith, ''Napoleonic Wars Databook.'' London: Greenhill Press, 1998, p. 178.</ref>\n\n==Orders of battle==\n\n===French===\n{{main|Army of the Danube}}\nThe exact order of battle of French forces is not clear, but contemporary sources suggest the presence of a portion of General [[Claude Lecourbe]]'s Corps of 28,368, including the forces of generals [[Anne Gilbert de Laval|Laval]], [[Gabriel Jean Joseph Molitor|Molitor]], [[Henri-Antoine Jardon|Jardon]], and [[Dominique Vandamme|Vandamme]].<ref>Smith, p. 177.</ref>  This is also confirmed in an extract of Moreau's dispatch to the French Minister of War, published in the ''London Chronicle'', 10 June 1800.  \"The 6th [[Chasseur]]s, 13th Cavalry, 4th [[Hussar]]s and 11th Chasseurs distinguished themselves in this affair.  The rest of the division, and that of [Lecourbe], passed rapidly [along] the Danube...General Grenier was equally well prepared.\"<ref>Van Es,Life of Napoleon... ''Extract of a letter from Gen. Moreau to the Minister of War, Neresheim, June 20.''</ref> In addition, the presence (and death) of [[Th\u00e9ophile Corret de la Tour d'Auvergne]], the First Grenadier of France, suggests that the grenadier company of the 46th Demi-brigade infantry ''de ligne'' was at least engaged.<ref>Mathieu Dumas, ''Memoirs of his own time: including the revolution, the empire, and the restoration,'' Volume 2, Lee and Blanchard, 1839, p. 105.</ref>  In addition, General [[Jean-Louis-Brigitte Espagne|Espagne]]'s 37th and 84th Regiments were engaged, as were grenadiers the 109th Regiment.  Lecourbe mentions the 37th and the 109th several times in his own account of the battle,<ref>J.

After the [[Battle of Messkirch]], both [[Gouvion Saint-Cyr]] and [[Jean-Chrysost\u00f4me Bruneteau de Sainte-Suzanne|Sainte-Suzanne]] had retired to the Rhine, taking many of their forces with them.  Consequently,  Moreau had assigned had the cavalry commanded by [[Jean-Joseph Ange d'Hautpoul]] to reinforce Lecourbe's division.<ref>[[Adolphe Thiers]], translated by J. Stapleton.

On that morning, the divisions of [[Charles-\u00c9tienne Gudin de La Sablonni\u00e8re|Gudin]] and [[Joseph H\u00e9lie D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Perruquet de Montrichard|Montrichard]] marched toward the junction of the Danube and [[Lech (river)|Lech]] rivers from [[Donauw\u00f6rth]]. General Gudin's division followed a southward track toward [[P\u00f6ttmes]] and established a line north to [[Ehekirchen]], approximately {{convert|3|mi|km|sp=us}} (roughly along what is now road 2035).  Montrichard's division, the 10th ''Demi-Brigade de L\u00e9g\u00e8re'' and the 38th and 67th ''Regiments de Ligne'' marched toward Neuburg, which he was instructed to occupy with his right wing connecting to Gudin's and covered the road between Augsburg and Neuburg. Gudin's division encountered some resistance before it could take possession of P\u00f6ttmes, but succeeded with several charges executed by the 6th and 8th Hussars, who also captured 100 horses from the Austrians.  General Puthed, who commanded the brigade on General Gudin's left, took control of Ehekirchen with little opposition.<ref name=\"MacGowan, ''Neu''.\">''The Field of Mars''</ref>\n\nGeneral Montrichard's division approached Neuburg on the causeway that ran parallel to the river and took possession of the outskirts of the city with little problem.  Kray's troops, joined with [[Prince Heinrich XV of Reuss-Plauen|Prince Reuss-Plauen]] and emerged from Neuburg to defend the outskirts.  Both Austrian forces were unprepared for battle at the moment, which allowed Montrichard's troops to penetrate within four miles of the city with little opposition.<ref name=\"MacGowan, ''Neu''.\"/> Espagne's brigade supported the advance guard, and after a brief action took the heights of [[Oberhausen (near Neuburg)|Oberhausen]] with the 37th and the 84th Regiments.  By early afternoon, the Austrians had recovered the village of Niederhausen, but the village of Unterhausen remained in French hands, defended by 100 marksmen, portions of the 37th Regiment and the 1st company of grenadiers of the 109th regiment.<ref name=\"MacGowan, ''Neu''.\"/>\n\nFrom this point on, combat centered on the village of Unterhausen, {{convert|3.8|mi|km|sp=us}} west-south-west of Neuburg center. A few French platoons drove the Austrians from the forest located between the village and the Danube with a bayonet charge by the grenadiers of the 109th. As French reserves arrived, the Austrians counterattacked and retook the woods, the heights at Oberhausen, and the village.  According to Lecourbe's account, the Austrians, \"embolden by this first success, soon covered all the surrounding heights, on which they planted about twenty-five or thirty pieces of cannon.\"<ref name=\"MacGowan, ''Neu''.\"/> At eight o'clock at night, after twelve hours of battle, companies of the 14th and 46th Regiments (French) moved along a small road on the right of the village, and another group proceeded on the left, enveloping the village.  The subsequent simultaneous French attack at both flanks and the center convinced the Austrians that, despite the defensive barrages laid by their artillery in Oberhausen, the French had been massively reinforced. The attack on the village, executed without firing a shot, involved fierce hand-to-hand fighting in which the commander of the 46th Regiment and the First Grenadier of France, Latour D'Auvergne, were both killed.<ref name=\"MacGowan, ''Neu''.\"/><ref group=Note>Sources are unclear about the name of the commander of the 46th prior to the battle; in July 1800, Moreau appointed [[Louis-Fran\u00e7ois Lanchantin]] as commander; he was promoted to colonel in 1804.

Lecourbe ordered his troops not to pursue, as nightfall was on them.<ref name=\"MacGowan, ''Neu''.\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe battle had immediate implications.

General Moreau ordered the establishment of a tomb on the location were the First Grenadier had fallen.<ref>Marceau, p. 105.</ref> [[Francis II of Austria|Emperor Francis II]] dismissed P\u00e1l Kray, who had lost an impressive succession of battles, and appointed his brother, the 18-year-old general major Archduke John, to command the Austrian army.

Similarly, in Italy, French successes at the battles at [[Battle of Montebello (1800)|Montebello]] and [[Battle of Marengo|Marengo]] forced Austrian withdrawal to the east. With France threatening Habsburg Austria from the northwest and southwest, the Austrians agreed to a cease fire.  Subsequent peace negotiations were complicated by the alliance Austria had made with Britain, and which prevented her from signing any separate peace.  The British entered the negotiations to bolster their weakened ally.  Initially Britain, which had successfully blockaded French ports, refused the French terms and offered counter terms in September 1800. Napoleon later claimed that the Austrians did not negotiate in good faith, and sought only to gain time until \"the rainy season\" (winter), when army movements would be difficult, and the Habsburgs would have an entire season to recruit.<ref>Gaspard Baron Gourgaud, editor, ''Memoirs of the History of France during the reign of Napoleon I,'' Oxford, 18233, pp 1\u201323.</ref>\n\n==Notes and citations==\n\n===Notes===\n{{reflist|group=Note}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Sources==\n\n* Arnold, James R.

Neuburg is located on the Danube between [[Ingolstadt]] and [[Donauw\u00f6rth]]. This battle occurred late in the [[War of the Second Coalition]] (1798\u20131802), the second war between [[French First Republic|Revolutionary France]] and the conservative European monarchies, which included at one time or another [[Great Britain|Britain]], [[Austrian monarchy|Habsburg Austria]], [[Russia]] (until late 1799), the [[Ottoman Empire]] (Turkey), [[Portugal]] and [[Naples]]. After a series of reverses, several of the allies withdrew from the Coalition.  By 1800, Napoleon's military victories in northern Italy challenged Habsburg supremacy there.  French victories in the upper Danubian territories opened a route along that river to Vienna.\n\nIn a series of battles in what is now southern Germany, the French pushed the combined Austrian and Coalition force back, first capturing [[Stockach]], then [[Messkirch]], then [[Biberach an der Riss|Biberach]].  After his loss at Biberach, the Coalition commander [[P\u00e1l Kray]] withdrew to the fortress at [[Ulm]], leaving detachments to secure the Danube crossings that lay further to the east, at [[H\u00f6chst\u00e4dt an der Donau|H\u00f6chst\u00e4dt]], [[Blindheim]], Donauw\u00f6rth, and Neuburg. The battle at Neuburg was the last of the Danube campaign for the summer of 1800; the armistice between the Habsburgs and the French was signed a couple of days later and ended in late November, and the French ultimately defeated the Austrians at the battles at [[Battle of Ampfing (1800)|Ampfing]] and [[Battle of Hohenlinden|Hohenlinden]].  The heaviest action of the battle occurred in the village of Unterhausen, in the outskirts of Neuburg.\n\n==Background==\n{{main|French Revolutionary Wars}}\nBy early 1799, the French Directory had become impatient with stalling tactics employed by Austria. The uprising in Naples raised further alarms, and recent gains in Switzerland suggested the timing was fortuitous to venture on another campaign in northern Italy and southwestern Germany.<ref>Timothy Blanning. ''The French Revolutionary Wars,'' New York, Oxford University Press. p. 200.</ref> At the beginning of 1800, the armies of France and Austria faced each other across the Rhine. [[Feldzeugmeister]] P\u00e1l Kray led approximately 120,000 troops. In addition to his Austrian regulars, his force included 12,000 men from the Electorate of Bavaria, 6,000 troops from the [[Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg]], 5,000 soldiers of low quality from the [[Archbishopric of Mainz]], and 7,000 militiamen from the [[County of Tyrol]]. Of these, 25,000 men were deployed east of [[Lake Constance|Lake Constance (Bodensee)]] to protect the [[Vorarlberg]]. Kray posted his main body of 95,000 soldiers in the L-shaped angle where the Rhine changes direction from a westward flow along the northern border of [[Switzerland]] to a northward flow along the eastern border of France. Unwisely, Kray set up his main magazine at Stockach, near the northwestern end of Lake Constance, only a day's march from French-held Switzerland.<ref>James R. Arnold, ''Marengo & Hohenlinden.'' Barnsley, South Yorkshire, UK: Pen & Sword, 2005, pp. 197\u2013199.</ref>\n\n===Strategic importance of Danube Valley===\n\nThe French war goal, to occupy Vienna and force the Habsburgs to accept and comply with peace terms established in 1798, required a double-pronged invasion through northern Italy, which First Consul Napoleon commanded, and through southern Germany, a campaign that fell to Moreau.  To secure access into Bavaria and, eventually, to Vienna, the French needed to control the Danube riverway. This was not a new tactic: The stretch of river between Ulm and Neuburg had been the site of major battles of the [[Thirty Years' War]] and [[War of the Spanish Succession]].  Between Ulm and Ingolstadt, the Danube grows significantly in volume, making it a wide and swift waterway. The [[Iller]] joins the Danube at [[Ulm]], dumping massive amounts of water into the stream; at Donauw\u00f6rth, the Lech enters the Danube. Neuburg, the first significant city on the river after Donauw\u00f6rth, had been the family seat of the princes of [[Pfalz-Neuburg]]; taking it from a princely family of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] would be a blow to the morale and prestige of the Habsburgs, whose role it was to protect the small princely domains. Control of the bridges and passages between Ulm and Donauw\u00f6rth, Neuburg, then Ingolstadt offered an advantage of both transport and prestige.<ref>Andrew Beattie, ''The Danube: A Cultural History.''  Oxford University Press, 2010, pp. 29\u201333.</ref>\n\n===Preliminary to battle===\n\nAfter withdrawing from Biberach, Kray waited at Ulm for Moreau's assault, which did not come. Instead of striking directly at the well-fortified and supplied city, Moreau's first division, approaching Ulm from the south, suddenly veered to the east and struck at the smaller forces posted between Ulm and Donauw\u00f6rth.<ref>David Eggenberger, \"H\u00f6chst\u00e4dt II\", ''An Encyclopedia of Battles'', Dover Publications, 2014, p. 193.</ref>  Its commander, Claude Lecourbe, secured posts in [[Landsberg am Lech|Landsberg]] and [[Augsburg]], and left sufficient rearguard troops to protect himself from [[Prince Heinrich XV of Reuss-Plauen|Prince Reuss-Plauen]], who remained in the Tyrol guarding mountain access to Vienna.  Lecourbe then approached Dettingen, Blindheim (Blenheim) and H\u00f6chst\u00e4dt.  The corps of General [[Paul Grenier]] had been posted with its right flank to the Danube and Gunzburg, and their left flank at Kinsdorf.  General [[Antoine Richepanse|Richepanse]] protected both shores of the [[Iller]], covering the road from Ulm south to [[Memmingen]], and secured communication with Switzerland; there, he withstood considerable skirmishing with the Austrians.  Three divisions of reserve remained at the hamlets of Kamlack and Mindel, to support an attack made by General Lecourbe on Ulm, in a case it should succeed, or Grenier's attack upon [[G\u00fcnzburg]], in case Lecourbe should not succeed. At the battle at [[Battle of H\u00f6chst\u00e4dt (1800)|H\u00f6chst\u00e4dt]], a full Austrian corps maintained possession until dislodged by repeated attacks of [[carabiner]]s, [[cuirassier]]s and [[hussar]]s, who took about 2,000 of the Austrians and W\u00fcrttembergers as prisoners, along with some cannons and standards.<ref>Willem Lodewyk Van-Es, ''The Life of Napoleon Buonaparte ...: With a Concise History of the Events'' W. Day, 1810 \u2013 France, pp. 31\u201335.</ref>  Once H\u00f6chst\u00e4dt and its nearby bridges fell on 19 June, the French controlled the Danube crossings between Ulm and Donauw\u00f6rth. Kray abandoned Ulm, and withdrew further downstream. The next French target would be Neuburg.<ref>Digby Smith, Smith, ''Napoleonic Wars Databook.'' London: Greenhill Press, 1998, p. 178.</ref>\n\n==Orders of battle==\n\n===French===\n{{main|Army of the Danube}}\nThe exact order of battle of French forces is not clear, but contemporary sources suggest the presence of a portion of General [[Claude Lecourbe]]'s Corps of 28,368, including the forces of generals [[Anne Gilbert de Laval|Laval]], [[Gabriel Jean Joseph Molitor|Molitor]], [[Henri-Antoine Jardon|Jardon]], and [[Dominique Vandamme|Vandamme]].<ref>Smith, p. 177.</ref>  This is also confirmed in an extract of Moreau's dispatch to the French Minister of War, published in the ''London Chronicle'', 10 June 1800.  \"The 6th [[Chasseur]]s, 13th Cavalry, 4th [[Hussar]]s and 11th Chasseurs distinguished themselves in this affair.  The rest of the division, and that of [Lecourbe], passed rapidly [along] the Danube...General Grenier was equally well prepared.\"<ref>Van Es,Life of Napoleon... ''Extract of a letter from Gen. Moreau to the Minister of War, Neresheim, June 20.''</ref> In addition, the presence (and death) of [[Th\u00e9ophile Corret de la Tour d'Auvergne]], the First Grenadier of France, suggests that the grenadier company of the 46th Demi-brigade infantry ''de ligne'' was at least engaged.<ref>Mathieu Dumas, ''Memoirs of his own time: including the revolution, the empire, and the restoration,'' Volume 2, Lee and Blanchard, 1839, p. 105.</ref>  In addition, General [[Jean-Louis-Brigitte Espagne|Espagne]]'s 37th and 84th Regiments were engaged, as were grenadiers the 109th Regiment.  Lecourbe mentions the 37th and the 109th several times in his own account of the battle,<ref>J.

After the [[Battle of Messkirch]], both [[Gouvion Saint-Cyr]] and [[Jean-Chrysost\u00f4me Bruneteau de Sainte-Suzanne|Sainte-Suzanne]] had retired to the Rhine, taking many of their forces with them.  Consequently,  Moreau had assigned had the cavalry commanded by [[Jean-Joseph Ange d'Hautpoul]] to reinforce Lecourbe's division.<ref>[[Adolphe Thiers]], translated by J. Stapleton.

On that morning, the divisions of [[Charles-\u00c9tienne Gudin de La Sablonni\u00e8re|Gudin]] and [[Joseph H\u00e9lie D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Perruquet de Montrichard|Montrichard]] marched toward the junction of the Danube and [[Lech (river)|Lech]] rivers from [[Donauw\u00f6rth]]. General Gudin's division followed a southward track toward [[P\u00f6ttmes]] and established a line north to [[Ehekirchen]], approximately {{convert|3|mi|km|sp=us}} (roughly along what is now road 2035).  Montrichard's division, the 10th ''Demi-Brigade de L\u00e9g\u00e8re'' and the 38th and 67th ''Regiments de Ligne'' marched toward Neuburg, which he was instructed to occupy with his right wing connecting to Gudin's and covered the road between Augsburg and Neuburg. Gudin's division encountered some resistance before it could take possession of P\u00f6ttmes, but succeeded with several charges executed by the 6th and 8th Hussars, who also captured 100 horses from the Austrians.  General Puthed, who commanded the brigade on General Gudin's left, took control of Ehekirchen with little opposition.<ref name=\"MacGowan, ''Neu''.\">''The Field of Mars''</ref>\n\nGeneral Montrichard's division approached Neuburg on the causeway that ran parallel to the river and took possession of the outskirts of the city with little problem.  Kray's troops, joined with [[Prince Heinrich XV of Reuss-Plauen|Prince Reuss-Plauen]] and emerged from Neuburg to defend the outskirts.  Both Austrian forces were unprepared for battle at the moment, which allowed Montrichard's troops to penetrate within four miles of the city with little opposition.<ref name=\"MacGowan, ''Neu''.\"/> Espagne's brigade supported the advance guard, and after a brief action took the heights of [[Oberhausen (near Neuburg)|Oberhausen]] with the 37th and the 84th Regiments.  By early afternoon, the Austrians had recovered the village of Niederhausen, but the village of Unterhausen remained in French hands, defended by 100 marksmen, portions of the 37th Regiment and the 1st company of grenadiers of the 109th regiment.<ref name=\"MacGowan, ''Neu''.\"/>\n\nFrom this point on, combat centered on the village of Unterhausen, {{convert|3.8|mi|km|sp=us}} west-south-west of Neuburg center. A few French platoons drove the Austrians from the forest located between the village and the Danube with a bayonet charge by the grenadiers of the 109th. As French reserves arrived, the Austrians counterattacked and retook the woods, the heights at Oberhausen, and the village.  According to Lecourbe's account, the Austrians, \"embolden by this first success, soon covered all the surrounding heights, on which they planted about twenty-five or thirty pieces of cannon.\"<ref name=\"MacGowan, ''Neu''.\"/> At eight o'clock at night, after twelve hours of battle, companies of the 14th and 46th Regiments (French) moved along a small road on the right of the village, and another group proceeded on the left, enveloping the village.  The subsequent simultaneous French attack at both flanks and the center convinced the Austrians that, despite the defensive barrages laid by their artillery in Oberhausen, the French had been massively reinforced. The attack on the village, executed without firing a shot, involved fierce hand-to-hand fighting in which the commander of the 46th Regiment and the First Grenadier of France, Latour D'Auvergne, were both killed.<ref name=\"MacGowan, ''Neu''.\"/><ref group=Note>Sources are unclear about the name of the commander of the 46th prior to the battle; in July 1800, Moreau appointed [[Louis-Fran\u00e7ois Lanchantin]] as commander; he was promoted to colonel in 1804.

This melee continued until about 2200, when the Austrians withdrew from Unterhausen.  Lecourbe ordered his troops not to pursue, as nightfall was on them.<ref name=\"MacGowan, ''Neu''.\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe battle had immediate implications. General [[Ney]] established his headquarters in the castle at Neuburg, which over looks the battlefield.  General Moreau ordered the establishment of a tomb on the location were the First Grenadier had fallen.<ref>Marceau, p. 105.</ref> [[Francis II of Austria|Emperor Francis II]] dismissed P\u00e1l Kray, who had lost an impressive succession of battles, and appointed his brother, the 18-year-old general major Archduke John, to command the Austrian army.

Similarly, in Italy, French successes at the battles at [[Battle of Montebello (1800)|Montebello]] and [[Battle of Marengo|Marengo]] forced Austrian withdrawal to the east. With France threatening Habsburg Austria from the northwest and southwest, the Austrians agreed to a cease fire.  Subsequent peace negotiations were complicated by the alliance Austria had made with Britain, and which prevented her from signing any separate peace.  The British entered the negotiations to bolster their weakened ally.  Initially Britain, which had successfully blockaded French ports, refused the French terms and offered counter terms in September 1800. Napoleon later claimed that the Austrians did not negotiate in good faith, and sought only to gain time until \"the rainy season\" (winter), when army movements would be difficult, and the Habsburgs would have an entire season to recruit.<ref>Gaspard Baron Gourgaud, editor, ''Memoirs of the History of France during the reign of Napoleon I,'' Oxford, 18233, pp 1\u201323.</ref>\n\n==Notes and citations==\n\n===Notes===\n{{reflist|group=Note}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Sources==\n\n* Arnold, James R.

The author brings together multigenerational knowledge and practices to \"counter the idea that [[aborigine| aboriginal]] [[innovation]] is primitive and exists isolated from [[technology]]. \" TEK is the acronym for \"Traditional Ecological Knowledge\".\n\n==Many definitions==\n===Binary definition===\nAccording to the ''Cambridge International Dictionary of English'', the concept of low-tech is simply defined as a technique that is not recent, or using old [[material]]s <ref name=\"dico\"/>. Companies that are considered ''low-tech'' have a simple operation. The less sophisticated an object, the more low-tech.  They are sometimes even assimilated to [[archaic]] methods. This definition does not take into account the [[ecological]] or [[social]] aspect, as it is only based on a simplistic definition of low-tech philosophy. The low-techs would then be seen as a \"step backwards\", and not as possible [[innovation]].\n\nAlso, with this definition, the \"[[high-tech]]\" (ex: the [[telegraph]]) of a certain era becomes the \"low-tech\" of the one after (ex: compared to the [[telephone]]).\n\n===Technocriticists===\n{{main|Technocriticism}}\nLow-tech is sometimes described as an \"anti [[high-tech]]\" movement, as a deliberate renunciation of a complicated and expensive [[technology]]. This kind of protest [[Social_movement|movement]] criticizes any disproportionate [[technology]]: a comparison with the [[Neo-Luddism|neo-luddic]] or [[Technocriticism| technocritical]] [[Social_movement|movement]]s, which appeared since the [[Industrial Revolution]], is then possible. This critical part of the ''low-tech'' movement can be called \"no-tech\", see for instance \"[https://www.notechmagazine.com/2016/07/no-tech-reader-7.html| No-tech magazine]\".\n\n===Recently: a wider and more balanced approach===\nA second, more nuanced definition of low-tech may appear. This definition takes into account the [[philosophy| philosophical]], [[eco-friendly|environmental]] and [[social]] aspects. Low-tech are no longer restricted to old [[technique]]s, but also extended to new, future-oriented techniques, more [[eco-friendly |ecological]] and intended to recreate [[social]] bounds. A low-tech innovation is then possible <ref name=\"bihouix2014\"/>.\n\nContrary to the first definition, this one is much more [[optimistic]] and has a [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/positive#Adjective| positive] connotation. It would then oppose the [[planned obsolescence]] of objects (often \u201c[[high-tech]]\u201d) and question the [[consumer society]], as well as the [[materialist]] principles underneath. With this definition, the concept of ''low-tech'' thus implies that anyone could make objects using their intelligence, and share their [[know-how]] to popularize their creations. A low-tech must therefore be [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/accessible#Adjective| accessible] to all, and could therefore help in reduction of [[Economic_inequality| inequalities]] <ref name=\"bihouix2014\"/>.\n\nFurthermore, some reduce the definition of low-tech to meet basic needs (eating, drinking, housing, heating ...), which disqualifies many technologies from the definition of low-techs, but this definition does not is not always accepted <ref name=\"GrimaudTastevin2017\">{{cite journal|last1=Grimaud|first1=Emmanuel|last2=Tastevin|first2=Yann Philippe|last3=Vidal|first3=Denis|journal=Techniques & culture|language=french|issue=67|year=2017|title=Low-tech ?

The author brings together multigenerational knowledge and practices to \"counter the idea that [[aborigine| aboriginal]] [[innovation]] is primitive and exists isolated from [[technology]]. \" TEK is the acronym for \"Traditional Ecological Knowledge\".\n\n==Many definitions==\n===Binary definition===\nAccording to the ''Cambridge International Dictionary of English'', the concept of low-tech is simply defined as a technique that is not recent, or using old [[material]]s <ref name=\"dico\"/>. Companies that are considered ''low-tech'' have a simple operation. The less sophisticated an object, the more low-tech.  They are sometimes even assimilated to [[archaic]] methods. This definition does not take into account the [[ecological]] or [[social]] aspect, as it is only based on a simplistic definition of low-tech philosophy. The low-techs would then be seen as a \"step backwards\", and not as possible [[innovation]].\n\nAlso, with this definition, the \"[[high-tech]]\" (ex: the [[telegraph]]) of a certain era becomes the \"low-tech\" of the one after (ex: compared to the [[telephone]]).\n\n===Technocriticists===\n{{main|Technocriticism}}\nLow-tech is sometimes described as an \"anti [[high-tech]]\" movement, as a deliberate renunciation of a complicated and expensive [[technology]]. This kind of protest [[Social_movement|movement]] criticizes any disproportionate [[technology]]: a comparison with the [[Neo-Luddism|neo-luddic]] or [[Technocriticism| technocritical]] [[Social_movement|movement]]s, which appeared since the [[Industrial Revolution]], is then possible. This critical part of the ''low-tech'' movement can be called \"no-tech\", see for instance \"[https://www.notechmagazine.com/2016/07/no-tech-reader-7.html| No-tech magazine]\".\n\n===Recently: a wider and more balanced approach===\nA second, more nuanced definition of low-tech may appear. This definition takes into account the [[philosophy| philosophical]], [[eco-friendly|environmental]] and [[social]] aspects. Low-tech are no longer restricted to old [[technique]]s, but also extended to new, future-oriented techniques, more [[eco-friendly |ecological]] and intended to recreate [[social]] bounds. A low-tech innovation is then possible <ref name=\"bihouix2014\"/>.\n\nContrary to the first definition, this one is much more [[optimistic]] and has a [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/positive#Adjective| positive] connotation. It would then oppose the [[planned obsolescence]] of objects (often \u201c[[high-tech]]\u201d) and question the [[consumer society]], as well as the [[materialist]] principles underneath. With this definition, the concept of ''low-tech'' thus implies that anyone could make objects using their intelligence, and share their [[know-how]] to popularize their creations. A low-tech must therefore be [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/accessible#Adjective| accessible] to all, and could therefore help in reduction of [[Economic_inequality| inequalities]] <ref name=\"bihouix2014\"/>.\n\nFurthermore, some reduce the definition of low-tech to meet basic needs (eating, drinking, housing, heating ...), which disqualifies many technologies from the definition of low-techs, but this definition does not is not always accepted <ref name=\"GrimaudTastevin2017\">{{cite journal|last1=Grimaud|first1=Emmanuel|last2=Tastevin|first2=Yann Philippe|last3=Vidal|first3=Denis|journal=Techniques & culture|language=french|issue=67|year=2017|title=Low-tech ? Wild-Tech !|issn=0248-6016|doi=10.4000/tc.8260}}</ref>\n. Finally, considering that the definition of low-tech is relative, some prefer to use ''lower tech'' <ref name=\"bihouix2014\"/>, to emphasize a higher sobriety compared to [[high-tech]], without claiming to be perfectly \"low\".\n\n==Examples of low technology==\n\n'''Note:''' almost all of the entries in this section should be prefixed by the word ''traditional''.\n\n* [[weaving]] produced on non-automated looms, and [[basketry]].\n* hand [[wood-working]], [[joiner]]y, [[coopering]], and [[carpentry]].\n* the trade of the [[shipwright|ship-wright]].\n* the trade of the [[Wheelwright|wheel-wright]].\n* the trade of the [[wainwright]]: making wagons.
