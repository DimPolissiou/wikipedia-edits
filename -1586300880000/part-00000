At its height, the khanate ruled from eastern [[Cumania]] (modern-day West Kazakhstan) to most of [[Uzbekistan]], [[Karakalpakstan]] and the [[Syr Darya]] river with military confrontation as far as [[Astrakhan]] and [[Khorasan Province]], which are now in Russia and Iran, respectively. The Khanate also engaged in slavery and raids in its neighboring countries of [[Russia]] and [[Central Asia]], and was later weakened by a series of [[Oirats|Oirat]] and [[Dzungar Khanate|Dzungar]] invasions. These resulted in a decline and further disintegration into three [[J\u00fcz]]-es, which gradually lost their sovereignty and were incorporated to the expanding [[Russian Empire]]. Its establishment marked the beginning of Kazakh statehood<ref name=ehist1>{{cite web |title=Kazakh Khanate \u2013 550th anniversary |url=http://e-history.kz/en/project/view/3?type=publications&material_id=954 |website=e-history.kz }}</ref> whose 550th anniversary was celebrated in 2015.<ref>{{cite news |title=Kazakhstan to Celebrate 550th Kazakh Statehood Anniversary in 2015 |url=http://astanatimes.com/2014/10/kazakhstan-celebrate-550th-kazakh-statehood-anniversary-2015/ |work=Astana Times }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn 1227, a proto-Kazakh state was formed within the [[Golden Horde]] in the steppe, which was the [[White Horde]]. After its separation from the Golden Horde in 1361, the White Horde became an independent state for a certain period of time, sometimes uniting with the [[Blue Horde]] to reestablish the Golden Horde. However, after the death of Khan of the Golden Horde, [[Barak|Barak Khan]] in 1428 the Golden Horde became fragmented, and the White Horde itself was divided into the [[Uzbek Khanate]] and the [[Nogai Horde]] while the remaining land was divided between Mustafa Khan in the south and Mohammed Khan in the north. The Uzbek Khanate, which dominated most of present-day Kazakhstan, was ruled by [[Abu'l-Khayr Khan]] who conspired in killing Barak Khan. Under Abu\u2019l-Khayr Khan's leadership, the Uzbek Khanate became a corrupt, unstable, and weak state that often dealt internal problems. To make matters worse, the khanate itself was raided by Oirats who pillaged nomadic settlements and major cities where they were looted, damaged, and had civilians massacred. Peace was made in 1457 between the Uzbeks and the Oirats where Abu\u2019l-Khayr Khan suffered a severe defeat which made him lose reputation among the Uzbeks.\n\n===Formation===\n[[File:Khanat of Kazakhstan - 550 years.jpg|thumb|left|A 2015 Kazakhstani stamp commemorating the 550th Anniversary of the Kazakh Khanate's establishment]]\n\nThe formation of the Kazakh Khanate began in 1459, when several Uzbek tribes dissatisfied with Abu\u2019l-Khayr's rule, led by two sons of Barak Khan, [[Janibek Khan|Janibek]] and [[Kerei Khan|Kerei]], fled the [[Uzbek Khanate]] in an event known as the ''Great Migration''. The two brothers led the nomads towards [[Moghulistan]], eventually settling and establishing an independent state. The new khanate soon became a buffer state between the Moghulistan and the Uzbek Khanate. \nAlthough both Janibek Khan and Kerei Khan were considered the founding rulers of the Kazakh Khanate, it was Janibek Khan who initially wielded the most power. Eager to liberate his land from Abu\u2019l Khayr Khan, Janibek invaded the Uzbek Khanate in 1468. Abu\u2019l Khayr, in response, launched a campaign against the Kazakhs, but died on his way to [[Zhetysu]]. Upon the death of Kerei Khan in 1473/4 Janibek Khan became the sole ruler.\nThe early years of the Kazakh Khanate were marked by struggles for control of the steppe against the Abu'l-Khayr's grandson, [[Muhammad Shaybani]]. In 1470, the Kazakhs defeated Shaybani at the city of Iasy (present-day [[Turkistan]]), forcing the Uzbeks to retreat south to Samarkand and Bukhara.\nIn 1480 Kerei Khan's son Burunduk became khan. During his reign, the Kazakhs were able to muster an army of 50,000 men and to repeatedly defeat the forces of Muhammad Shaybani along the Syr Darya river. It was during his reign, that the Uzbeks concluded peace with the Kazakhs in 1500, thus giving all the former Uzbek Khanate lands in the north of Syr Darya to the Kazakh Khanate.\n\n====Expansion of the Kazakh Khanate====\n[[Kasym Khan|Kasym]], son of [[janibek Khan|Janibek]], became the Khan in 1511. Under his rule, the Kazakh Khanate reached its greatest strength so much that the [[Nogai Horde]], which occupied the territory of modern Western Kazakhstan, became its number one enemy. Kasym successfully captured the Nogai capital Saray-Juk in 1520, pushing the Nogai Horde to the [[Astrakhan Khanate]]. Under Kasym Khan, the borders of the Kazakh Khanate expanded, the population reached 1 million people. It was during the reign of Kasym Khan that the Kazakh Khanate gained fame and political weight in the modern Euro-Asian arena. The first major state to establish diplomatic relations with the Kazakh Khanate was the [[Tsardom of Russia]]. Since then, the Kazakh Khanate seen as a new political entity to the Western Europe.\n\nKasym Khan also instituted the first Kazakh code of laws in 1520, called \"\u049a\u0430\u0441\u044b\u043c \u0445\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u04a3 \u049b\u0430\u0441\u049b\u0430 \u0436\u043e\u043b\u044b\" (transliterated, \"Qas\u0131m xann\u0131\u00f1 qasqa jol\u0131\" \u2014 \"Bright Road of Kasym Khan\"). Kasym Khan also ratified his alliance with the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] leader [[Babur]], particularly after the fall of the [[Shaybanid]]s, and was thus praised by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] and the populace of [[Samarqand]].\n\n===Turmoil and civil war===\nAfter the death of Kasym Khan, the Nogaiys restored their status quo by capturing the territory before in the west of the Turgai River. The Kazakh Khanate itself focused on the territory of Zhetysu and South Kazakhstan, where a strife was starting to happen. The central territory of Kazakhstan, Sary-Arka, at that time was nominally part of the Kazakh Khanate. The Khanate of Sibir seized the northern regions of Sary-Arka.\nUnder Taiyr Khan, the Oirats invaded and captured eastern parts of Sary Arka in the 1520s.\nIn the early 1530s, a civil war began in the Kazakh Khanate between the grandsons of Janibek Khan. [[Haqnazar Khan]] emerged as victories and reunited the khanate under his control.\n\n===Haqnazar Khan (1537\u20131580)===\nUnder Haqnazar Khan, also known as Haq-Nazar Khan<ref name=\"britannica1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/254780/Haqq-Nazar |title=Haqq Nazar &#124; Kazakh ruler |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-02}}</ref> or Ak Nazar Khan,<ref>A History of the Moghuls of Central Asia: The Tarikh-i-Rashidi</ref> the Kazakh Khanate faced competition from several directions: the [[Nogai Horde]] in the west, the [[Khanate of Sibir]] in the north, [[Moghulistan]] in the east and the [[Khanate of Bukhara]] in the south.\n\nHaqnazar Khan began to liberate the occupied Kazakh lands. He returned the northern regions of Sary-Arka to the Kazakh Khanate. Having begun a campaign against the Nogai Horde, Haqnazar reconquered Saraishyk from the Nogai Horde and the surrounding Kazakh territories as well. In the fight against the Khivans, the Kazakhs conquered the Mangyshlak peninsula and successfully repelled the Oirats. Haqnazar began a campaign against [[Moghulistan]] with the aim of finally incorporating Zhetysu into the Kazakh Khanate. The campaign ended successfully and resulted in defeat for Moghulistan. However, in the north, there was a threat from the Khanate of Sibir, led by Khan Kuchum.\nIn 1568, the Kazakhs successfully defeated the [[Nogai Horde]] at the [[Emba River]] and reached [[Astrakhan]], but were repelled by [[Tsardom of Russia|Russian]] forces.\n<ref name=\"britannica1\"/>\n<ref>A History of the Moghuls of Central Asi: The Tarikh-i-Rashidi\n By Mirza Muhammad Haidar Dughlt, N.

In 1598, Kazakh forces approached [[Bukhara]] and besieged it for 12 days, but afterwards the Bukharan leader Pir-Muhammad and reinforcements under the command of his brother Baki-Muhammad pushed back the Kazakhs. In that battle, Tauekel Khan was wounded and died during the retreat back to [[Tashkent]].\n\n===Esim Khan (1598\u20131628)===\nAfter the death of Tauekel Khan came Esim Sultan, son of Sheehan Khan. His reign was the time of the next (third) strengthening of the Kazakh Khanate after Kasim Khan and Khak-Nazar Khan. Esim Khan moved the capital of the khanate to Sygnak in Turkestan and suppressed the revolts of the Karakalpaks.\n\nThere followed a 15-year period of calm between the Kazakh Khanate and the Khanate of Bukhara.\n\nEsim Khan established peace with the [[Khanate of Bukhara]] and returned control of [[Samarkand]] to them. However, Bukhara was still bitter about the loss of [[Tashkent]], which led to additional conflicts. Starting in 1607, the [[Khanate of Bukhara]] engaged in several battles and eventually obtained control of Tashkent.\n\nEsim Khan united the Kazakh army and began a campaign against the Tashkent Khan Tursun Muhammad and Khan of Bukhara. In 1627, he defeated the enemy. Esim Khan abolished the Tashkent Khanate and the war finally ended.\n\n===Salqam-Jangir Khan (1629\u20131680)===\n\nDuring Salqam-Jangir Khan's reign, a new and powerful rival of the Kazakhs appeared in the east, known as the [[Zunghars|Zunghar Khanate]]. The [[Zunghar]] had recently converted to [[Mahayana]] [[Buddhism]] and their [[Erdeni Batur]] believed he could reestablish the 13th-century empire of [[Genghis Khan]]. However, much had changed since the days of the [[Mongol Empire]], and the [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]]s, like the [[Kyrgyz people|Kirghiz]] and the [[Tatar]]s, had almost entirely converted to [[Islam]] under the authority of [[Emir]] [[Timur]], who also reestablished new centers of power such as [[Samarqand]] and [[Bukhara]], which had greatly influenced the founding of the Kazakh Khanate.\n\nIn 1652, the Zunghar leader [[Erdeni Batur]] attempted to eliminate the Kazakh Khanate and its inhabitants; he dispatched more than 50,000 [[Zunghar]] warriors against the Kazakh Khanate, which refused to submit to him. The early stages of the [[Kazakh-Dzungar Wars]] took place in the [[Altai Mountains]] and later battles were fought on the vast steppes. Unable to halt the advance of the Zunghars, the Kazakh [[Ghazi warriors|Ghazis]] and their leader Salqam-Jangir Khan's forces were defeated. Unfortunately in the year 1680, Salqam-Jangir Khan died in battle, protecting his people against the Zunghars.\n\n===Tauke Khan (1680\u20131718)===\n[[Tauke Khan]] was elected as the leader of the Kazakh Khanate immediately after the death of Salqam-Jangir Khan, and he led the battered [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] warriors across the steppes to resist the advance of the [[Zunghar]]s. Unfortunately, the already weakened Kazakhs were once again faced with defeat at [[Sayram (city)|Sayram]] and soon lost many major cities to the Zunghars.\n\nTauke Khan soon sought alliances with the [[Kyrgyz people|Kirghiz]] in the southeast who were also facing a Zunghar invasion in their [[Issyk-Kul Lake]] region and even the [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]] of the [[Tarim Basin]]. In 1687, Zunghars besieged [[Hazrat-e Turkestan]] and were forced to retreat after the arrival of Subhan Quli Khan.\n\nIn 1697, [[Tsewang Rabtan]] became the leader of the [[Zunghar Khanate]], and he dispatched several of his commanders to subjugate [[Tauke Khan]] and many major wars between the Zunghars and the Kazakh Khanate continued into the following years: 1709, 1711\u20141712, 1714 and 1718. The Kazakh Khanate had indeed been weakened by the confrontation and nearly one-third of their population had been lost by the ensuing conflict. With Tauke Khan's death in 1718, the Kazakh Khanate splintered into three ''[[J\u00fcz]]'' \u2014 the [[Great j\u00fcz]], the [[Middle j\u00fcz]] and the [[Little j\u00fcz]]. Each [[J\u00fcz]] had its own [[Khan (title)|Khan]] from this time onward.\n\nTauke Khan is also known for refining the Kazakh code of laws, and reissuing it under the title \"\u0416\u0435\u0442\u0456 \u0416\u0430\u0440\u0493\u044b\" (transliterated, \"Jeti Jar\u011fi\"\u2014\"Seven Charters\").\n\n===Ablai Khan (1771\u20131781)===\n[[Ablai Khan]] was a khan of the [[Middle j\u00fcz]] or Horde who managed to extend his control over the other two j\u00fczes to include all of the [[Kazakhs]]. Before he became khan, Ablai participated in [[Kazakh-Dzungar Wars]] and proved himself a talented organizer and commander. He led numerous campaigns against the Kokand Khanate and the Kyrgyz. In the latter campaign, his troops liberated many cities in Southern Kazakhstan and even captured Tashkent. During his actual reign, Ablai Khan did his best to keep Kazakhstan as independent as possible from the encroaching [[Russian Empire]] and the Chinese [[Qing dynasty]]. He employed a multi-vector foreign policy to protect the tribes from Chinese and [[Dzungar people|Dzungar]] aggressors. He also sheltered the Dzungar [[Oirats|Oirat]] ''taishas'' [[Amursana]] and [[Dawachi]] from attacks by the [[Khoshut]]-Orait King of [[Tibet]], [[Lha-bzang Khan]], as the [[Dzungar Khanate]] fractured following the death of [[Galdan Tseren]] in 1745. However, once Amursana and Dawachi were no longer allies, Ablai Khan took the opportunity to capture herds and territory from the Dzungars.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Peter C|last1=Perdue|title=China Marches West: The Qing Conquest of Central Eurasia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J4L-_cjmSqoC|year=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-04202-5|page=274}}</ref>\n\n===Kenesary Khan (1841\u20131847)===\nKenesary was the last Kazakh [[Khan (title)|Khan]], and the leader of national liberation movement that resisted the capture of Kazakh lands and [[Racial segregation|segregation]] policies by the Russian Empire. He was the grandson of [[Ablai Khan]] and is largely regarded as the last ruler of the Kazakh Khanate.\n\nBy the mid 19th century, the Kazakhs fell under the full control of the Russian Empire and were banned from electing their own leader or even given representation in the empire's legislative structures. All fiscal/tax collections were also taken away from local Kazakh representatives and given to Russian administrators. Kenesary Khan fought against the Russian imperial forces until his death in 1847.\n\nIn 1841, at an all-Kazakh [[Kurultai]], Kenesary was elected as [[Khan (title)|Khan]] (supreme leader) by all Kazakh representatives. The ceremony of [[coronation]] followed all Kazakh traditions.\n\nAs a freedom fighter and popular as a leading voice against the increasingly aggressive and forceful policies of the Russian Empire, Kenesary was ruthless in his actions and unpredictable as a military strategist. By 1846, however, his resistance movement had lost momentum as some of his rich associates had defected to the Russian Empire, having been bribed and been promised great riches. Betrayed, Kenesary Khan grew increasingly suspicious of the remaining members of the Resistance, possibly further alienating them. In 1847, the Khan of the Kazakhs met his death in Kyrgyz lands during his assault on northern Kyrgyz tribes. He was executed by Ormon Khan, the Kyrgyz khan who was subsequently rewarded by the Russians with a larger estate and an official administrative role. Kenesary Khan's head was cut off and sent to the Russians.\n\nOver the last decade, Kenesary Khan has been increasingly regarded as a hero in Kazakh literature and media. Kenesary Khan can be seen on the shore of the river Esil in the capital of Kazakhstan, [[Nur-Sultan]].\n\n=== Disintegration of Khanate and Russian conquest ===\n{{main|Kazakhstan in the Russian Empire}}\n[[Image:\u0416\u0443\u0437.svg|thumb|300 px|Approximate areas occupied by the three Kazakh J\u00fczes in the early 20th century. Green represents the [[Junior J\u00fcz]], orange represents the [[Middle j\u00fcz]] and red represents the [[Senior J\u00fcz]].]]\nGradual decline, disintegration and accession of Kazakh territories into the Russian Empire began in the mid-18th and ended in the second part of the 19th century. By the mid-18th century, as a result of long-lasting armed conflicts with [[Dzungar Khanate|Dzungars]] and [[Oirats]], the Kazakh Khanate had started to decline and further disintegrate into three [[J\u00fcz]]es, which formerly constituted the Kazakh Khanate in a [[Confederation|confederate]] form.\n\nBy the mid-19th century some tribes of the [[Middle j\u00fcz|Middle J\u00fcz]] started war with the Russian occupiers. However, the process was long and filled with lots of minor and major armed conflicts and resistance.\n\nRussian colonial policies/strategies brought military fortresses, lots of settlements, and externally imposed rules into Kazakh lands. \nA series of laws were introduced by the Russian Empire, abolishing local indigenous government in the form of Khan rule, instituting segregative settlement policies, etc., resulting in numerous uprisings against colonial rule. Significant resistance movements were led by leaders such as [[Isatay Taymanuly]] (1836\u20131837), [[Makhambet Utemisuly]] (1836\u20131838) and [[Eset Kotibaruli]] (1847\u20131858).\n\nMeanwhile, the Senior J\u00fcz sided with the [[Emirate of Bukhara]] and the [[Khanate of Kokand]] from the south, and started opposing the expansion of the Russian Empire.\n\nFull Russian rule over all Kazakh lands was established in the second half of the 19th century, after the southern towns of [[Kyzylorda|Aq-Meshit]], [[Shymkent]], [[Taraz|Aulie-Ata]] and others were taken by the Russian Imperial Army.\n\n==Slavery==\n\nBy the mid 18th century, the [[Russian Empire]] had expanded into [[Siberia]], and Russian settlements started to appear along the [[River Volga|Volga]] and [[Ural River|Yaik]] rivers. The Kazakh-Russian relationship at the border regions was tense, which often resulted in mutual raids by Russian Cossacks on Kazakh lands and Kazakhs on Russian settlements.\n\n=== Kazakh Khanate slave trade on Russian settlement ===\n\nDuring the 18th century, raids by Kazakhs on Russia's territory of [[Orenburg]] were common; the Kazakhs captured many Russians and sold them as slaves in the Central Asian market.

Its establishment marked the beginning of Kazakh statehood<ref name=ehist1>{{cite web |title=Kazakh Khanate \u2013 550th anniversary |url=http://e-history.kz/en/project/view/3?type=publications&material_id=954 |website=e-history.kz }}</ref> whose 550th anniversary was celebrated in 2015.<ref>{{cite news |title=Kazakhstan to Celebrate 550th Kazakh Statehood Anniversary in 2015 |url=http://astanatimes.com/2014/10/kazakhstan-celebrate-550th-kazakh-statehood-anniversary-2015/ |work=Astana Times }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn 1227, a proto-Kazakh state was formed within the [[Golden Horde]] in the steppe, which was the [[White Horde]]. After its separation from the Golden Horde in 1361, the White Horde became an independent state for a certain period of time, sometimes uniting with the [[Blue Horde]] to reestablish the Golden Horde. However, after the death of Khan of the Golden Horde, [[Barak|Barak Khan]] in 1428 the Golden Horde itself became split, and the White Horde itself was divided into the [[Uzbek Khanate]] and the [[Nogai Horde]] while the remaining land was divided between Mustafa Khan in the south and Mohammed Khan in the north. The Uzbek Khanate, which dominated most of present-day Kazakhstan, was ruled by [[Abu'l-Khayr Khan]] who conspired in killing Barak Khan. Under Abu\u2019l-Khayr Khan's leadership, the Uzbek Khanate became a corrupt, unstable, and weak state that often dealt internal problems. To make matters worse, the khanate itself was raided by Oirats who pillaged nomadic settlements and major cities where they were looted, damaged, and had civilians massacred. Peace was made in 1457 between the Uzbeks and the Oirats where Abu\u2019l-Khayr Khan suffered a severe defeat which made him lose reputation among the Uzbeks.\n\n===Formation===\n[[File:Khanat of Kazakhstan - 550 years.jpg|thumb|left|A 2015 Kazakhstani stamp commemorating the 550th Anniversary of the Kazakh Khanate's establishment]]\n\nThe formation of the Kazakh Khanate began in 1459, when several Uzbek tribes dissatisfied with Abu\u2019l-Khayr's rule, led by two sons of Barak Khan, [[Janibek Khan|Janibek]] and [[Kerei Khan|Kerei]], fled the [[Uzbek Khanate]] in an event known as the ''Great Migration''. The two brothers led the nomads towards [[Moghulistan]], eventually settling and establishing an independent state. The new khanate soon became a buffer state between the Moghulistan and the Uzbek Khanate. \nAlthough both Janibek Khan and Kerei Khan were considered the founding rulers of the Kazakh Khanate, it was Janibek Khan who initially wielded the most power. Eager to liberate his land from Abu\u2019l Khayr Khan, Janibek invaded the Uzbek Khanate in 1468. Abu\u2019l Khayr, in response, launched a campaign against the Kazakhs, but died on his way to [[Zhetysu]]. Upon the death of Kerei Khan in 1473/4 Janibek Khan became the sole ruler.\nThe early years of the Kazakh Khanate were marked by struggles for control of the steppe against the Abu'l-Khayr's grandson, [[Muhammad Shaybani]]. In 1470, the Kazakhs defeated Shaybani at the city of Iasy (present-day [[Turkistan]]), forcing the Uzbeks to retreat south to Samarkand and Bukhara.\nIn 1480 Kerei Khan's son Burunduk became khan. During his reign, the Kazakhs were able to muster an army of 50,000 men and to repeatedly defeat the forces of Muhammad Shaybani along the Syr Darya river. It was during his reign, that the Uzbeks concluded peace with the Kazakhs in 1500, thus giving all the former Uzbek Khanate lands in the north of Syr Darya to the Kazakh Khanate.\n\n====Expansion of the Kazakh Khanate====\n[[Kasym Khan|Kasym]], son of [[janibek Khan|Janibek]], became the Khan in 1511. Under his rule, the Kazakh Khanate reached its greatest strength so much that the [[Nogai Horde]], which occupied the territory of modern Western Kazakhstan, became its number one enemy. Kasym successfully captured the Nogai capital Saray-Juk in 1520, pushing the Nogai Horde to the [[Astrakhan Khanate]]. Under Kasym Khan, the borders of the Kazakh Khanate expanded, the population reached 1 million people. It was during the reign of Kasym Khan that the Kazakh Khanate gained fame and political weight in the modern Euro-Asian arena. The first major state to establish diplomatic relations with the Kazakh Khanate was the [[Tsardom of Russia]]. Since then, the Kazakh Khanate seen as a new political entity to the Western Europe.\n\nKasym Khan also instituted the first Kazakh code of laws in 1520, called \"\u049a\u0430\u0441\u044b\u043c \u0445\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u04a3 \u049b\u0430\u0441\u049b\u0430 \u0436\u043e\u043b\u044b\" (transliterated, \"Qas\u0131m xann\u0131\u00f1 qasqa jol\u0131\" \u2014 \"Bright Road of Kasym Khan\"). Kasym Khan also ratified his alliance with the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] leader [[Babur]], particularly after the fall of the [[Shaybanid]]s, and was thus praised by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] and the populace of [[Samarqand]].\n\n===Turmoil and civil war===\nAfter the death of Kasym Khan, the Nogaiys restored their status quo by capturing the territory before in the west of the Turgai River. The Kazakh Khanate itself focused on the territory of Zhetysu and South Kazakhstan, where a strife was starting to happen. The central territory of Kazakhstan, Sary-Arka, at that time was nominally part of the Kazakh Khanate. The Khanate of Sibir seized the northern regions of Sary-Arka.\nUnder Taiyr Khan, the Oirats invaded and captured eastern parts of Sary Arka in the 1520s.\nIn the early 1530s, a civil war began in the Kazakh Khanate between the grandsons of Janibek Khan. [[Haqnazar Khan]] emerged as victories and reunited the khanate under his control.\n\n===Haqnazar Khan (1537\u20131580)===\nUnder Haqnazar Khan, also known as Haq-Nazar Khan<ref name=\"britannica1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/254780/Haqq-Nazar |title=Haqq Nazar &#124; Kazakh ruler |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-02}}</ref> or Ak Nazar Khan,<ref>A History of the Moghuls of Central Asia: The Tarikh-i-Rashidi</ref> the Kazakh Khanate faced competition from several directions: the [[Nogai Horde]] in the west, the [[Khanate of Sibir]] in the north, [[Moghulistan]] in the east and the [[Khanate of Bukhara]] in the south.\n\nHaqnazar Khan began to liberate the occupied Kazakh lands. He returned the northern regions of Sary-Arka to the Kazakh Khanate. Having begun a campaign against the Nogai Horde, Haqnazar reconquered Saraishyk from the Nogai Horde and the surrounding Kazakh territories as well. In the fight against the Khivans, the Kazakhs conquered the Mangyshlak peninsula and successfully repelled the Oirats. Haqnazar began a campaign against [[Moghulistan]] with the aim of finally incorporating Zhetysu into the Kazakh Khanate. The campaign ended successfully and resulted in defeat for Moghulistan. However, in the north, there was a threat from the Khanate of Sibir, led by Khan Kuchum.\nIn 1568, the Kazakhs successfully defeated the [[Nogai Horde]] at the [[Emba River]] and reached [[Astrakhan]], but were repelled by [[Tsardom of Russia|Russian]] forces.\n<ref name=\"britannica1\"/>\n<ref>A History of the Moghuls of Central Asi: The Tarikh-i-Rashidi\n By Mirza Muhammad Haidar Dughlt, N.

In 1598, Kazakh forces approached [[Bukhara]] and besieged it for 12 days, but afterwards the Bukharan leader Pir-Muhammad and reinforcements under the command of his brother Baki-Muhammad pushed back the Kazakhs. In that battle, Tauekel Khan was wounded and died during the retreat back to [[Tashkent]].\n\n===Esim Khan (1598\u20131628)===\nAfter the death of Tauekel Khan came Esim Sultan, son of Sheehan Khan. His reign was the time of the next (third) strengthening of the Kazakh Khanate after Kasim Khan and Khak-Nazar Khan. Esim Khan moved the capital of the khanate to Sygnak in Turkestan and suppressed the revolts of the Karakalpaks.\n\nThere followed a 15-year period of calm between the Kazakh Khanate and the Khanate of Bukhara.\n\nEsim Khan established peace with the [[Khanate of Bukhara]] and returned control of [[Samarkand]] to them. However, Bukhara was still bitter about the loss of [[Tashkent]], which led to additional conflicts. Starting in 1607, the [[Khanate of Bukhara]] engaged in several battles and eventually obtained control of Tashkent.\n\nEsim Khan united the Kazakh army and began a campaign against the Tashkent Khan Tursun Muhammad and Khan of Bukhara. In 1627, he defeated the enemy. Esim Khan abolished the Tashkent Khanate and the war finally ended.\n\n===Salqam-Jangir Khan (1629\u20131680)===\n\nDuring Salqam-Jangir Khan's reign, a new and powerful rival of the Kazakhs appeared in the east, known as the [[Zunghars|Zunghar Khanate]]. The [[Zunghar]] had recently converted to [[Mahayana]] [[Buddhism]] and their [[Erdeni Batur]] believed he could reestablish the 13th-century empire of [[Genghis Khan]]. However, much had changed since the days of the [[Mongol Empire]], and the [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]]s, like the [[Kyrgyz people|Kirghiz]] and the [[Tatar]]s, had almost entirely converted to [[Islam]] under the authority of [[Emir]] [[Timur]], who also reestablished new centers of power such as [[Samarqand]] and [[Bukhara]], which had greatly influenced the founding of the Kazakh Khanate.\n\nIn 1652, the Zunghar leader [[Erdeni Batur]] attempted to eliminate the Kazakh Khanate and its inhabitants; he dispatched more than 50,000 [[Zunghar]] warriors against the Kazakh Khanate, which refused to submit to him. The early stages of the [[Kazakh-Dzungar Wars]] took place in the [[Altai Mountains]] and later battles were fought on the vast steppes. Unable to halt the advance of the Zunghars, the Kazakh [[Ghazi warriors|Ghazis]] and their leader Salqam-Jangir Khan's forces were defeated. Unfortunately in the year 1680, Salqam-Jangir Khan died in battle, protecting his people against the Zunghars.\n\n===Tauke Khan (1680\u20131718)===\n[[Tauke Khan]] was elected as the leader of the Kazakh Khanate immediately after the death of Salqam-Jangir Khan, and he led the battered [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] warriors across the steppes to resist the advance of the [[Zunghar]]s. Unfortunately, the already weakened Kazakhs were once again faced with defeat at [[Sayram (city)|Sayram]] and soon lost many major cities to the Zunghars.\n\nTauke Khan soon sought alliances with the [[Kyrgyz people|Kirghiz]] in the southeast who were also facing a Zunghar invasion in their [[Issyk-Kul Lake]] region and even the [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]] of the [[Tarim Basin]]. In 1687, Zunghars besieged [[Hazrat-e Turkestan]] and were forced to retreat after the arrival of Subhan Quli Khan.\n\nIn 1697, [[Tsewang Rabtan]] became the leader of the [[Zunghar Khanate]], and he dispatched several of his commanders to subjugate [[Tauke Khan]] and many major wars between the Zunghars and the Kazakh Khanate continued into the following years: 1709, 1711\u20141712, 1714 and 1718. The Kazakh Khanate had indeed been weakened by the confrontation and nearly one-third of their population had been lost by the ensuing conflict. With Tauke Khan's death in 1718, the Kazakh Khanate splintered into three ''[[J\u00fcz]]'' \u2014 the [[Great j\u00fcz]], the [[Middle j\u00fcz]] and the [[Little j\u00fcz]]. Each [[J\u00fcz]] had its own [[Khan (title)|Khan]] from this time onward.\n\nTauke Khan is also known for refining the Kazakh code of laws, and reissuing it under the title \"\u0416\u0435\u0442\u0456 \u0416\u0430\u0440\u0493\u044b\" (transliterated, \"Jeti Jar\u011fi\"\u2014\"Seven Charters\").\n\n===Ablai Khan (1771\u20131781)===\n[[Ablai Khan]] was a khan of the [[Middle j\u00fcz]] or Horde who managed to extend his control over the other two j\u00fczes to include all of the [[Kazakhs]]. Before he became khan, Ablai participated in [[Kazakh-Dzungar Wars]] and proved himself a talented organizer and commander. He led numerous campaigns against the Kokand Khanate and the Kyrgyz. In the latter campaign, his troops liberated many cities in Southern Kazakhstan and even captured Tashkent. During his actual reign, Ablai Khan did his best to keep Kazakhstan as independent as possible from the encroaching [[Russian Empire]] and the Chinese [[Qing dynasty]]. He employed a multi-vector foreign policy to protect the tribes from Chinese and [[Dzungar people|Dzungar]] aggressors. He also sheltered the Dzungar [[Oirats|Oirat]] ''taishas'' [[Amursana]] and [[Dawachi]] from attacks by the [[Khoshut]]-Orait King of [[Tibet]], [[Lha-bzang Khan]], as the [[Dzungar Khanate]] fractured following the death of [[Galdan Tseren]] in 1745. However, once Amursana and Dawachi were no longer allies, Ablai Khan took the opportunity to capture herds and territory from the Dzungars.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Peter C|last1=Perdue|title=China Marches West: The Qing Conquest of Central Eurasia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J4L-_cjmSqoC|year=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-04202-5|page=274}}</ref>\n\n===Kenesary Khan (1841\u20131847)===\nKenesary was the last Kazakh [[Khan (title)|Khan]], and the leader of national liberation movement that resisted the capture of Kazakh lands and [[Racial segregation|segregation]] policies by the Russian Empire. He was the grandson of [[Ablai Khan]] and is largely regarded as the last ruler of the Kazakh Khanate.\n\nBy the mid 19th century, the Kazakhs fell under the full control of the Russian Empire and were banned from electing their own leader or even given representation in the empire's legislative structures. All fiscal/tax collections were also taken away from local Kazakh representatives and given to Russian administrators. Kenesary Khan fought against the Russian imperial forces until his death in 1847.\n\nIn 1841, at an all-Kazakh [[Kurultai]], Kenesary was elected as [[Khan (title)|Khan]] (supreme leader) by all Kazakh representatives. The ceremony of [[coronation]] followed all Kazakh traditions.\n\nAs a freedom fighter and popular as a leading voice against the increasingly aggressive and forceful policies of the Russian Empire, Kenesary was ruthless in his actions and unpredictable as a military strategist. By 1846, however, his resistance movement had lost momentum as some of his rich associates had defected to the Russian Empire, having been bribed and been promised great riches. Betrayed, Kenesary Khan grew increasingly suspicious of the remaining members of the Resistance, possibly further alienating them. In 1847, the Khan of the Kazakhs met his death in Kyrgyz lands during his assault on northern Kyrgyz tribes. He was executed by Ormon Khan, the Kyrgyz khan who was subsequently rewarded by the Russians with a larger estate and an official administrative role. Kenesary Khan's head was cut off and sent to the Russians.\n\nOver the last decade, Kenesary Khan has been increasingly regarded as a hero in Kazakh literature and media. Kenesary Khan can be seen on the shore of the river Esil in the capital of Kazakhstan, [[Nur-Sultan]].\n\n=== Disintegration of Khanate and Russian conquest ===\n{{main|Kazakhstan in the Russian Empire}}\n[[Image:\u0416\u0443\u0437.svg|thumb|300 px|Approximate areas occupied by the three Kazakh J\u00fczes in the early 20th century. Green represents the [[Junior J\u00fcz]], orange represents the [[Middle j\u00fcz]] and red represents the [[Senior J\u00fcz]].]]\nGradual decline, disintegration and accession of Kazakh territories into the Russian Empire began in the mid-18th and ended in the second part of the 19th century. By the mid-18th century, as a result of long-lasting armed conflicts with [[Dzungar Khanate|Dzungars]] and [[Oirats]], the Kazakh Khanate had started to decline and further disintegrate into three [[J\u00fcz]]es, which formerly constituted the Kazakh Khanate in a [[Confederation|confederate]] form.\n\nBy the mid-19th century some tribes of the [[Middle j\u00fcz|Middle J\u00fcz]] started war with the Russian occupiers. However, the process was long and filled with lots of minor and major armed conflicts and resistance.\n\nRussian colonial policies/strategies brought military fortresses, lots of settlements, and externally imposed rules into Kazakh lands. \nA series of laws were introduced by the Russian Empire, abolishing local indigenous government in the form of Khan rule, instituting segregative settlement policies, etc., resulting in numerous uprisings against colonial rule. Significant resistance movements were led by leaders such as [[Isatay Taymanuly]] (1836\u20131837), [[Makhambet Utemisuly]] (1836\u20131838) and [[Eset Kotibaruli]] (1847\u20131858).\n\nMeanwhile, the Senior J\u00fcz sided with the [[Emirate of Bukhara]] and the [[Khanate of Kokand]] from the south, and started opposing the expansion of the Russian Empire.\n\nFull Russian rule over all Kazakh lands was established in the second half of the 19th century, after the southern towns of [[Kyzylorda|Aq-Meshit]], [[Shymkent]], [[Taraz|Aulie-Ata]] and others were taken by the Russian Imperial Army.\n\n==Slavery==\n\nBy the mid 18th century, the [[Russian Empire]] had expanded into [[Siberia]], and Russian settlements started to appear along the [[River Volga|Volga]] and [[Ural River|Yaik]] rivers. The Kazakh-Russian relationship at the border regions was tense, which often resulted in mutual raids by Russian Cossacks on Kazakh lands and Kazakhs on Russian settlements.\n\n=== Kazakh Khanate slave trade on Russian settlement ===\n\nDuring the 18th century, raids by Kazakhs on Russia's territory of [[Orenburg]] were common; the Kazakhs captured many Russians and sold them as slaves in the Central Asian market. The [[Volga Germans]] were also victims of Kazakh raids; they were ethnic Germans living along the [[River Volga]] in the region of southeastern [[European Russia]] around [[Saratov]].\n\nIn 1717, 3,000 Russian slaves, men, women, and children, were sold in [[Khanate of Khiva|Khiva]] by Kazakh and Kyrgyz tribesmen.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=-8_3jbZU9ikC&pg=PT85&dq=Europe+and+the+latest+in+Russian+technology+in+exchange+for+3,000+Russian+slaves,+men,+women,+and+children+who+were+kept+there.&hl=en&sa=X&ei=-2fzUJacFsTMtAbssYBg&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA The History of the Central Asian Republics By Peter Roudik]</ref>\n\nIn 1722, they stole cattle, robbed from Russian villages and people trapped in captivity and sold in the slave markets of Central Asia (in 1722 in Bukhara were over 5,000 Russian prisoners). In the middle of the 17th century, 500 Russians were annually sold to Khiva by Kazakhs.\n\nIn 1730, the Kazakhs' frequent raids into Russian lands were a constant irritant and resulted in the enslavement of many of the Tsar's subjects, who were sold on the Kazakh steppe.<ref>Eastern Destiny: Russia in Asia and the North Pacific by G.

Meanwhile, three students of the nearby Freemount Academy for Men, including Jim Green (Matthew Modine) and his overweight, slobbish friend Bubba ([[Michael Zorek]]), sneak into Cherryvale to [[voyeurism|peek]] on the girls. Jordan Leigh-Jenson (Betsy Russell), showering at the time, sees that the boys are peering at her and enlists Chris and Betsy's help to drive them away; the three boys fall off the side of the building. In response to being disturbed, the roommates light a bag of horse manure on fire and put it in front of Jordan's door.\n\nAbout a week later, at a co-ed dance, Chris reveals that Jim is her boyfriend; as the couple are dancing, Chris tells Jim that she has decided she wants to surrender her virginity to him. After a speech by headmistress Miss Dutchbok ([[Fran Ryan]]), the band plays a slow song while Jordan dances alone and conspires against Chris. Bubba, sporting an erection from slow-dancing, sneaks off to the headmistress' office with Betsy to drink and have sex; however, the two are caught in the act by the headmistress and her friends. The following day, after morning aerobics, Chris books a hotel for Jim and herself.\n\nAfter another period of time, students of the two schools are riding horses together. Jordan trots past where Chris and Jim are talking and [[Exhibitionism|flashes her breasts]] at Jim. In revenge, Betsy steals Jordan's shirt, forcing the latter to ride topless in front of the headmistress ''et alumni''. That weekend, Jim goes to buy condoms, but is confused by the pharmacist ([[Martin Mull]] in an uncredited role) and ends up buying dental hygiene products; when Chris goes to buy the protection herself, she is distracted and eventually seen by Miss Dutchbok.\n\nAfter playing video games for a while in the arcade, Jim is embarrassed to talk romantically over the phone to Chris, while Jordan swears greater revenge. The following day, Jim, Bubba, and another friend [[Cross-dressing|dress as women]] and sneak into the girl's dorm. Jim is caught by Jordan, who teases him with a cold bottle and forces him to give her a massage. Meanwhile, Bubba meets up with Betsy for a tryst, but he leaves to smoke a cigarette before they have sex. As Bubba is on the ledge outside of Betsy's bathroom, he peers into Jordan's dorm room where Jim is massaging her on the bed. When Betsy goes to look for him, he is startled and falls off the ledge. Meanwhile, after Jim confesses to Jordan that he is in fact really a boy (which was already known to Jordan), she pretends to scream and kicks him out of the room, leading to Chris finding out about their indiscretion. Chris leaves the girl's sorority house, embarrassed and heartbroken.\n\nAfter several weeks of unsuccessfully trying to get Chris back, Jim asks Chris' father for his help in the matter during parent visitation day. After he and Betsy tell Chris to take Jim back, she does. Chris and Jim then leave for their night of romance at the hotel. After failing to have sex that night because Chris finds the hotel too kitschy, as well as getting sick from the room-service food, they have sex on the beach in the morning.\n\nMeanwhile, Jordan's father ([[Frank Aletter]]) has sex with her new stepmother while the chauffeur Chauncey ([[Ray Walston]]) listens in. Not long afterwards, Miss Dutchbok, who has mistaken Chauncey for Mr. Leigh-Jenson (Jordan's father), has sex with him in the back of Leigh-Jenson's car. Bubba and Betsy, looking to have another tryst, climb into the front seat and turn on the loudspeakers, ensuring that the chauffeur and Ms. Dutchbok's indiscretion are known by everyone present at the program. Upon realizing what Bubba has done, Miss Dutchbok lunges at him, eventually resulting in the car rolling out of control down a hill, and going into the pool. Afterwards, Bubba begins hitting on Jordan, eventually leading to Jordan paying him a midnight visit; when Betsy catches them together, she is apoplectic. The film ends with graduation day, where the graduating girls in the first row moon the Headmistress, Miss Dutchbok.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Phoebe Cates]] as Christine Ramsey\n* [[Betsy Russell]] as Jordan Leigh-Jenson\n* [[Matthew Modine]] as Jim Green\n* [[Michael Zorek]] as Bubba Beauregard\n* [[Fran Ryan]] as Miss Dutchbok\n* [[Kathleen Wilhoite]] as Betsy\n* [[Ray Walston]] as Chauncey\n* [[Sylvia Kristel]] as Ms. Regina Copoletta\n* [[Jonathan Prince]] as Roy\n* [[Kari Lizer]] as Rita\n* [[Julie Payne (actress, born 1946)|Julie Payne]] as Coach Whelan\n* [[Frank Aletter]] as Mr. Leigh-Jenson\n* [[Frances Bay]] as Birdie Fallmouth\n* [[Lynda Wiesmeier]] as schoolgirl\n\n==Production==\n''Private School'' was initiated in the wake of the surprise success of ''[[Private Lessons (1981 film)|Private Lessons]]'' in 1980.

Meanwhile, three students of the nearby Freemount Academy for Men, including Jim Green (Matthew Modine) and his overweight, slobbish friend Bubba ([[Michael Zorek]]), sneak into Cherryvale to [[voyeurism|peek]] on the girls. Jordan Leigh-Jenson (Betsy Russell), showering at the time, sees that the boys are peering at her and enlists Chris and Betsy's help to drive them away; the three boys fall off the side of the building. In response to being disturbed, the roommates light a bag of horse manure on fire and put it in front of Jordan's door.\n\nAbout a week later, at a co-ed dance, Chris reveals that Jim is her boyfriend; as the couple are dancing, Chris tells Jim that she has decided she wants to surrender her virginity to him. After a speech by headmistress Miss Dutchbok ([[Fran Ryan]]), the band plays a slow song while Jordan dances alone and conspires against Chris. Bubba, sporting an erection from slow-dancing, sneaks off to the headmistress' office with Betsy to drink and have sex; however, the two are caught in the act by the headmistress and her friends. The following day, after morning aerobics, Chris books a hotel for Jim and herself.\n\nAfter another period of time, students of the two schools are riding horses together. Jordan trots past where Chris and Jim are talking and [[Exhibitionism|flashes her breasts]] at Jim. In revenge, Betsy steals Jordan's shirt, forcing the latter to ride topless in front of the headmistress ''et alumni''. That weekend, Jim goes to buy condoms, but is confused by the pharmacist ([[Martin Mull]] in an uncredited role) and ends up buying dental hygiene products; when Chris goes to buy the protection herself, she is distracted and eventually seen by Miss Dutchbok.\n\nAfter playing video games for a while in the arcade, Jim is embarrassed to talk romantically over the phone to Chris, Jordan swears greater revenge. The following day, Jim, Bubba, and another friend [[Cross-dressing|dress as women]] and sneak into the girl's dorm. Jim is caught by Jordan, who teases him with a cold bottle and forces him to give her a massage. Meanwhile, Bubba meets up with Betsy for a tryst, but he leaves to smoke a cigarette before they have sex. As Bubba is on the ledge outside of Betsy's bathroom, he peers into Jordan's dorm room where Jim is massaging her on the bed. When Betsy goes to look for him, he is startled and falls off the ledge. Meanwhile, after Jim confesses to Jordan that he is in fact really a boy (which was already known to Jordan), she pretends to scream and kicks him out of the room, leading to Chris finding out about their indiscretion. Chris leaves the girl's sorority house, embarrassed and heartbroken.\n\nAfter several weeks of unsuccessfully trying to get Chris back, Jim asks Chris' father for his help in the matter during parent visitation day. After he and Betsy tell Chris to take Jim back, she does. Chris and Jim then leave for their night of romance at the hotel. After failing to have sex that night because Chris finds the hotel too kitschy, as well as getting sick from the room-service food, they have sex on the beach in the morning.\n\nMeanwhile, Jordan's father ([[Frank Aletter]]) has sex with her new stepmother while the chauffeur Chauncey ([[Ray Walston]]) listens in. Not long afterwards, Miss Dutchbok, who has mistaken Chauncey for Mr. Leigh-Jenson (Jordan's father), has sex with him in the back of Leigh-Jenson's car. Bubba and Betsy, looking to have another tryst, climb into the front seat and turn on the loudspeakers, ensuring that the chauffeur and Ms. Dutchbok's indiscretion are known by everyone present at the program. Upon realizing what Bubba has done, Miss Dutchbok lunges at him, eventually resulting in the car rolling out of control down a hill, and going into the pool. Afterwards, Bubba begins hitting on Jordan, eventually leading to Jordan paying him a midnight visit; when Betsy catches them together, she is apoplectic. The film ends with graduation day, where the graduating girls in the first row moon the Headmistress, Miss Dutchbok.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Phoebe Cates]] as Christine Ramsey\n* [[Betsy Russell]] as Jordan Leigh-Jenson\n* [[Matthew Modine]] as Jim Green\n* [[Michael Zorek]] as Bubba Beauregard\n* [[Fran Ryan]] as Miss Dutchbok\n* [[Kathleen Wilhoite]] as Betsy\n* [[Ray Walston]] as Chauncey\n* [[Sylvia Kristel]] as Ms. Regina Copoletta\n* [[Jonathan Prince]] as Roy\n* [[Kari Lizer]] as Rita\n* [[Julie Payne (actress, born 1946)|Julie Payne]] as Coach Whelan\n* [[Frank Aletter]] as Mr. Leigh-Jenson\n* [[Frances Bay]] as Birdie Fallmouth\n* [[Lynda Wiesmeier]] as schoolgirl\n\n==Production==\n''Private School'' was initiated in the wake of the surprise success of ''[[Private Lessons (1981 film)|Private Lessons]]'' in 1980.

From 2003 to 2008, he served as Brazil's [[Ministry of Culture (Brazil)|Minister of Culture]] in the administration of President [[Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva]]. Gil's musical style incorporates an eclectic range of influences, including rock, [[Music of Brazil|Brazilian genres]] including [[samba]], [[Music of Africa|African music]], and [[reggae]].\n\nGil started to play music as a child and was a teenager when he joined his first band. He began his career as a [[bossa nova]] musician and grew to write songs that reflected a focus on political awareness and social activism. He was a key figure in the [[M\u00fasica popular brasileira]] and [[Tropicalismo|tropic\u00e1lia]] movements of the 1960s, alongside artists such as longtime collaborator [[Caetano Veloso]]. The [[History of Brazil (1964\u20131985)|Brazilian military regime]] that [[1964 Brazilian coup d'\u00e9tat|took power]] in 1964 saw both Gil and Veloso as a threat, and the two were held for nine months in 1969 before they were told to leave the country.

'''Gilberto Gil''' ({{IPA-pt|\u0292iw\u02c8b\u025b\u0281tu \u02c8\u0292iw|br}}), is a [[Brazil]]ian singer, guitarist, and songwriter, known for both his musical innovation and political activism. From 2003 to 2008, he served as Brazil's [[Ministry of Culture (Brazil)|Minister of Culture]] in the administration of President [[Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva]]. Gil's musical style incorporates an eclectic range of influences, including rock, [[Music of Brazil|Brazilian genres]] including [[samba]], [[Music of Africa|African music]], and [[reggae]].\n\nGil started to play music as a child and was a teenager when he joined his first band. He began his career as a [[bossa nova]] musician and grew to write songs that reflected a focus on political awareness and social activism. He was a key figure in the [[M\u00fasica popular brasileira]] and [[Tropicalismo|tropic\u00e1lia]] movements of the 1960s, alongside artists such as longtime collaborator [[Caetano Veloso]]. The [[History of Brazil (1964\u20131985)|Brazilian military regime]] that [[1964 Brazilian coup d'\u00e9tat|took power]] in 1964 saw both Gil and Veloso as a threat, and the two were held for nine months in 1969 before they were told to leave the country. Gil moved to London, but returned to [[Bahia]] in 1972 and continued his musical career, as well as working as a politician and environmental advocate.\n\n== Early life (1942\u20131963) ==\nGil was born in [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]] and spent much of his childhood in nearby [[Itua\u00e7u]].

The region has been controlled by numerous peoples, including [[Ancient Egyptians]], [[Canaan]]ites, [[Israelites]] and [[Judeans]], [[Assyrian Empire|Assyrians]], [[Babylonian Empire|Babylonians]], [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenids]], [[Hellenistic period#Hellenistic Middle east|ancient Greeks]], the [[Jewish]] [[Hasmonean Kingdom]], [[Roman Empire|Romans]], [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]], [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanians]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], the Arab [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun]], [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]], [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] and [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] [[caliphate]]s, [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|Crusaders]], [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubids]], [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluks]], [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]], [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], the [[British Empire|British]], and modern [[Israelis]], [[Jordanians]], [[Egyptians]] and [[Palestinians]].\n\nThe boundaries of the region have changed throughout history.

Although some of Herodotus' references to Palestine are compatible with a narrow definition of the coastal strip of the Land of Israel, it is clear that Herodotus does call the \"whole land by the name of the coastal strip.\"...\"It is believed that Herodotus visited Palestine in the fifth decade of the fifth century B.C.\"...\"In the earliest Classical literature references to Palestine generally applied to the Land of Israel in the wider sense.\"}}{{sfn|Jacobson|2001|ps=: \"As early as the Histories of Herodotus, written in the second half of the fifth century B.C.E., the term Palaistin\u00ea is used to describe not just the geographical area where the Philistines lived, but the entire area between Phoenicia and Egypt\u2014in other words, the Land of Israel.

This would make the Israelites \"Palestinians\" not just in geographical and political terms (under the British Mandate, both Jews and Arabs living in the country were defined as Palestinians), but in ethnic and broader cultural terms as well. While this does not conform to the conventional view, or to the understanding of most Jews (and Arabs, for that matter), it is not easy to either prove or disprove. For although the Bible speaks at length about how the Israelites \"took\" the land, it is not a history book to draw reliable maps from. There is nothing in the extra-biblical sources, including the extensive Egyptian materials, to document the sojourn in Egypt or the exodus so vividly described in the Bible (and commonly dated to the thirteenth century). Biblical scholar Moshe Weinfeld sees the biblical account of the exodus, and of Moses and Joshua as founding heroes of the \"national narration,\" as a later rendering of a lived experience that was subsequently either \"forgotten\" or consciously repressed \u2013 a textbook case of the \"invented tradition\" so familiar to modern students of ethnicity and nationalism.\"}}\n\nDuring the Iron Age the Israelites established two related kingdoms, [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] and [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]].

Israel's southern neighbor, the Kingdom of Judah, emerged in the 8th or 9th century BCE and later became a client state of first the Neo-Assyrian and then the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] before a revolt against the latter led to its destruction in 586 BCE.\n\nThe region became part of the Neo-Assyrian Empire from c. 740 BCE,<ref>{{cite book|last=Crouch|first=C.

The political and military sprawl of the Assyrian empire during the late Iron Age in the southern Levant, especially toward its outer borders, is not quite akin to the single dominating hegemony envisioned by most discussions of hegemony and subversion. In the case of Judah it should be reiterated that Judah was always a vassal state, semi-autonomous and on the periphery of the imperial system, it was never a fully-integrated provincial territory. The implications of this distinction for Judah's relationship with and experience of the Assyrian empire should not be underestimated; studies of the expression of Assyria's cultural and political powers in its provincial territories and vassal states have revealed notable differences in the degree of active involvement in different types of territories. Indeed, the mechanics of the Assyrian empire were hardly designed for direct control over all its vassals' internal activities, provided that a vassal produced the requisite tribute and did not provoke trouble among its neighbors, the level of direct involvement from Assyria remained relatively low. For the entirety of its experience of the Assyrian empire, Judah functioned as a vassal state, rather than a province under direct Assyrian rule, thereby preserving at least a certain degree of autonomy, especially in its internal affairs. Meanwhile, the general atmosphere of Pax Assyriaca in the southern Levant minimized the necessity of (and opportunities for) external conflict. That Assyrians, at least in small numbers, were present in Judah is likely \u2013 probably a qipu and his entourage who, if the recent excavators of Ramat Rahel are correct, perhaps resided just outside the capital \u2013 but there is far less evidence than is commonly assumed to suggest that these left a direct impression of Assyria on this small vassal state... The point here is that, despite the wider context of Assyria's political and economic power in the ancient Near East in general and the southern Levant in particular, Judah remained a distinguishable and semi-independent southern Levantine state, '''part of but not subsumed by the Assyrian empire''' and, indeed, benefitting from it in significant ways.}}</ref> which was itself replaced by the Neo-Babylonian Empire in c. 627 BCE.{{sfn|Ahlstr\u00f6m|1993|p=655-741, 754\u2013784}} According to the Bible, a war with Egypt culminated in 586 BCE when Jerusalem was destroyed by the Babylonian king [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] and the king and upper class of the Kingdom of Judah were [[Babylonian captivity|deported to Babylon]].

The government of Israel and some supporters have, at times, disputed this position of the international community. In 2011, Andrew Sanger explained the situation as follows: \"Israel claims it no longer occupies the Gaza Strip, maintaining that it is neither a Stale nor a territory occupied or controlled by Israel, but rather it has 'sui generis' status. Pursuant to the Disengagement Plan, Israel dismantled all military institutions and settlements in Gaza and there is no longer a permanent Israeli military or civilian presence in the territory. However the Plan also provided that Israel will guard and monitor the external land perimeter of the Gaza Strip, will continue to maintain exclusive authority in Gaza air space, and will continue to exercise security activity in the sea off the coast of the Gaza Strip as well as maintaining an Israeli military presence on the Egyptian-Gaza border. and reserving the right to reenter Gaza at will. Israel continues to control six of Gaza's seven land crossings, its maritime borders and airspace and the movement of goods and persons in and out of the territory. Egypt controls one of Gaza's land crossings. Troops from the Israeli Defence Force regularly enter pans of the territory and/or deploy missile attacks, drones and sonic bombs into Gaza. Israel has declared a no-go buffer zone that stretches deep into Gaza: if Gazans enter this zone they are shot on sight. Gaza is also dependent on israel for inter alia electricity, currency, telephone networks, issuing IDs, and permits to enter and leave the territory. Israel also has sole control of the Palestinian Population Registry through which the Israeli Army regulates who is classified as a Palestinian and who is a Gazan or West Banker. Since 2000 aside from a limited number of exceptions Israel has refused to add people to the Palestinian Population Registry. It is this direct external control over Gaza and indirect control over life within Gaza that has led the United Nations, the UN General Assembly, the UN Fact Finding Mission to Gaza, International human rights organisations, US Government websites, the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office and a significant number of legal commentators, to reject the argument that Gaza is no longer occupied.\",{{sfn|Sanger|2011|p=429}} and in 2012 Iain Scobbie explained: \"Even after the accession to power of Hamas, Israel's claim that it no longer occupies Gaza has not been accepted by UN bodies, most States, nor the majority of academic commentators because of its exclusive control of its border with Gaza and crossing points including the effective control it exerted over the Rafah crossing until at least May 2011, its control of Gaza's maritime zones and airspace which constitute what Aronson terms the 'security envelope' around Gaza, as well as its ability to intervene forcibly at will in Gaza\"{{sfn|Scobbie|2012|p=295}} and Michelle Gawerc wrote in the same year: \"While Israel withdrew from the immediate territory, Israel still controlled all access to and from Gaza through the border crossings, as well as through the coastline and the airspace. ln addition, Gaza was dependent upon Israel for water electricity sewage communication networks and for its trade (Gisha 2007.

Its southwest point (at Raphia, Tell Rifa\u1e25, southwest of Gaza) is about 34\u00b0 15\u2032 E. longitude, and its northwest point (mouth of the Li\u1e6dani) is at 35\u00b0 15\u2032 E. longitude, while the course of the Jordan reaches 35\u00b0 35\u2032 to the east. The west-Jordan country has, consequently, a length of about 150 English miles from north to south, and a breadth of about {{convert|23|mi|0|abbr=out}} at the north and {{convert|80|mi|0|abbr=out}} at the south. The area of this region, as measured by the surveyors of the English Palestine Exploration Fund, is about {{convert|6040|mi2|0|abbr=out}}. The east-Jordan district is now being surveyed by the German Pal\u00e4stina-Verein, and although the work is not yet completed, its area may be estimated at {{convert|4000|mi2|0|abbr=out}}. This entire region, as stated above, was not occupied exclusively by the Israelites, for the plain along the coast in the south belonged to the Philistines, and that in the north to the Phoenicians, while in the east-Jordan country, the Israelitic possessions never extended farther than the Arnon (Wadi al-Mujib) in the south, nor did the Israelites ever settle in the most northerly and easterly portions of the plain of Bashan. To-day the number of inhabitants does not exceed 650,000. Palestine, and especially the Israelitic state, covered, therefore, a very small area, approximating that of the state of Vermont.\" From the Jewish Encyclopedia}}{{efn-lr|According to the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition]] (1911), Palestine is:{{sfn|EB|1911}} \"[A] geographical name of rather loose application. Etymological strictness would require it to denote exclusively the narrow strip of coast-land once occupied by the Philistines, from whose name it is derived. It is, however, conventionally used as a name for the territory which, in the Old Testament, is claimed as the inheritance of the pre-exilic Hebrews; thus it may be said generally to denote the southern third of the province of Syria. Except in the west, where the country is bordered by the Mediterranean Sea, the limit of this territory cannot be laid down on the map as a definite line. The modern subdivisions under the jurisdiction of the Ottoman Empire are in no sense conterminous with those of antiquity, and hence do not afford a boundary by which Palestine can be separated exactly from the rest of Syria in the north, or from the Sinaitic and Arabian deserts in the south and east; nor are the records of ancient boundaries sufficiently full and definite to make possible the complete demarcation of the country. Even the convention above referred to is inexact: it includes the Philistine territory, claimed but never settled by the Hebrews, and excludes the outlying parts of the large area claimed in Num. xxxiv. as the Hebrew possession (from the \" River of Egypt \" to Hamath). However, the Hebrews themselves have preserved, in the proverbial expression \" from Dan to Beersheba \" (Judg. xx.i, &c.), an indication of the normal north-and-south limits of their land; and in defining the area of the country under discussion it is this indication which is generally followed. Taking as a guide the natural features most nearly corresponding to these outlying points, we may describe Palestine as the strip of land extending along the eastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea from the mouth of the Litany or Kasimiya River (33\u00b0 20' N.) southward to the mouth of the Wadi Ghuzza; the latter joins the sea in 31\u00b0 28' N., a short distance south of Gaza, and runs thence in a south-easterly direction so as to include on its northern side the site of Beersheba. Eastward there is no such definite border. The River Jordan, it is true, marks a line of [[delimitation]] between Western and [[Transjordan (region)|Eastern Palestine]]; but it is practically impossible to say where the latter ends and the Arabian desert begins. Perhaps the line of the pilgrim road from Damascus to Mecca is the most convenient possible boundary. The total length of the region is about {{convert|140|m|2|abbr=on}}; its breadth west of the Jordan ranges from about {{convert|23|m|2|abbr=on}} in the north to about {{convert|80|m|2|abbr=on}} in the south.\"}} The [[Jordan Rift Valley]] (comprising Wadi Arabah, the [[Dead Sea]] and [[River Jordan]]) has at times formed a political and administrative frontier, even within empires that have controlled both territories.<ref name=\"Aharoni1979\">{{cite book|author=Yohanan Aharoni|title=The Land of the Bible: A Historical Geography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AMtoyNxWw0UC|date=1 January 1979|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-0-664-24266-4|quote=The desert served as an eastern boundary in times when Transjordan was occupied.

Out of a total population of about 300,000 souls, between a fifth and a quarter lived in the six towns of [[Jerusalem]], [[Gaza City|Gaza]], [[Safed]], [[Nablus]], [[Ramla|Ramle]], and [[Hebron]]. The remainder consisted mainly of peasants, living in villages of varying size, and engaged in agriculture. Their main food-crops were wheat and barley in that order, supplemented by leguminous pulses, olives, fruit, and vegetables. In and around most of the towns there was a considerable number of vineyards, orchards, and vegetable gardens.{{sfn|Lewis|1954|p=469-501}}{{Rp|487}}\n</blockquote>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right; margin-left:60px; float:right\"\n|-\n!

This would make the Israelites \"Palestinians\" not just in geographical and political terms (under the British Mandate, both Jews and Arabs living in the country were defined as Palestinians), but in ethnic and broader cultural terms as well. While this does not conform to the conventional view, or to the understanding of most Jews (and Arabs, for that matter), it is not easy to either prove or disprove. For although the Bible speaks at length about how the Israelites \"took\" the land, it is not a history book to draw reliable maps from. There is nothing in the extra-biblical sources, including the extensive Egyptian materials, to document the sojourn in Egypt or the exodus so vividly described in the Bible (and commonly dated to the thirteenth century). Biblical scholar Moshe Weinfeld sees the biblical account of the exodus, and of Moses and Joshua as founding heroes of the \"national narration,\" as a later rendering of a lived experience that was subsequently either \"forgotten\" or consciously repressed \u2013 a textbook case of the \"invented tradition\" so familiar to modern students of ethnicity and nationalism.\"}}\n\nDuring the Iron Age the Israelites established two related kingdoms, [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] and [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]]. The Kingdom of Israel emerged as an important local power by the 10th century BCE before falling to the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] in 722 BCE. Israel's southern neighbor, the Kingdom of Judah, emerged in the 8th or 9th century BCE and later became a client state of first the Neo-Assyrian and then the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] before a revolt against the latter led to its destruction in 586 BCE.\n\nThe region became part of the Neo-Assyrian Empire from c. 740 BCE,<ref>{{cite book|last=Crouch|first=C.

The political and military sprawl of the Assyrian empire during the late Iron Age in the southern Levant, especially toward its outer borders, is not quite akin to the single dominating hegemony envisioned by most discussions of hegemony and subversion. In the case of Judah it should be reiterated that Judah was always a vassal state, semi-autonomous and on the periphery of the imperial system, it was never a fully-integrated provincial territory. The implications of this distinction for Judah's relationship with and experience of the Assyrian empire should not be underestimated; studies of the expression of Assyria's cultural and political powers in its provincial territories and vassal states have revealed notable differences in the degree of active involvement in different types of territories. Indeed, the mechanics of the Assyrian empire were hardly designed for direct control over all its vassals' internal activities, provided that a vassal produced the requisite tribute and did not provoke trouble among its neighbors, the level of direct involvement from Assyria remained relatively low. For the entirety of its experience of the Assyrian empire, Judah functioned as a vassal state, rather than a province under direct Assyrian rule, thereby preserving at least a certain degree of autonomy, especially in its internal affairs. Meanwhile, the general atmosphere of Pax Assyriaca in the southern Levant minimized the necessity of (and opportunities for) external conflict. That Assyrians, at least in small numbers, were present in Judah is likely \u2013 probably a qipu and his entourage who, if the recent excavators of Ramat Rahel are correct, perhaps resided just outside the capital \u2013 but there is far less evidence than is commonly assumed to suggest that these left a direct impression of Assyria on this small vassal state... The point here is that, despite the wider context of Assyria's political and economic power in the ancient Near East in general and the southern Levant in particular, Judah remained a distinguishable and semi-independent southern Levantine state, '''part of but not subsumed by the Assyrian empire''' and, indeed, benefitting from it in significant ways.}}</ref> which was itself replaced by the Neo-Babylonian Empire in c. 627 BCE.{{sfn|Ahlstr\u00f6m|1993|p=655-741, 754\u2013784}} According to the Bible, a war with Egypt culminated in 586 BCE when Jerusalem was destroyed by the Babylonian king [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] and the king and upper class of the Kingdom of Judah were [[Babylonian captivity|deported to Babylon]].

In the 2005 [[Israeli disengagement from Gaza]], Israel withdrew all settlers and military presence from the Gaza Strip, but maintained military control of numerous aspects of the territory including its borders, air space and coast.

The government of Israel and some supporters have, at times, disputed this position of the international community. In 2011, Andrew Sanger explained the situation as follows: \"Israel claims it no longer occupies the Gaza Strip, maintaining that it is neither a Stale nor a territory occupied or controlled by Israel, but rather it has 'sui generis' status. Pursuant to the Disengagement Plan, Israel dismantled all military institutions and settlements in Gaza and there is no longer a permanent Israeli military or civilian presence in the territory. However the Plan also provided that Israel will guard and monitor the external land perimeter of the Gaza Strip, will continue to maintain exclusive authority in Gaza air space, and will continue to exercise security activity in the sea off the coast of the Gaza Strip as well as maintaining an Israeli military presence on the Egyptian-Gaza border. and reserving the right to reenter Gaza at will. Israel continues to control six of Gaza's seven land crossings, its maritime borders and airspace and the movement of goods and persons in and out of the territory. Egypt controls one of Gaza's land crossings. Troops from the Israeli Defence Force regularly enter pans of the territory and/or deploy missile attacks, drones and sonic bombs into Gaza. Israel has declared a no-go buffer zone that stretches deep into Gaza: if Gazans enter this zone they are shot on sight. Gaza is also dependent on israel for inter alia electricity, currency, telephone networks, issuing IDs, and permits to enter and leave the territory. Israel also has sole control of the Palestinian Population Registry through which the Israeli Army regulates who is classified as a Palestinian and who is a Gazan or West Banker. Since 2000 aside from a limited number of exceptions Israel has refused to add people to the Palestinian Population Registry. It is this direct external control over Gaza and indirect control over life within Gaza that has led the United Nations, the UN General Assembly, the UN Fact Finding Mission to Gaza, International human rights organisations, US Government websites, the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office and a significant number of legal commentators, to reject the argument that Gaza is no longer occupied.\",{{sfn|Sanger|2011|p=429}} and in 2012 Iain Scobbie explained: \"Even after the accession to power of Hamas, Israel's claim that it no longer occupies Gaza has not been accepted by UN bodies, most States, nor the majority of academic commentators because of its exclusive control of its border with Gaza and crossing points including the effective control it exerted over the Rafah crossing until at least May 2011, its control of Gaza's maritime zones and airspace which constitute what Aronson terms the 'security envelope' around Gaza, as well as its ability to intervene forcibly at will in Gaza\"{{sfn|Scobbie|2012|p=295}} and Michelle Gawerc wrote in the same year: \"While Israel withdrew from the immediate territory, Israel still controlled all access to and from Gaza through the border crossings, as well as through the coastline and the airspace. ln addition, Gaza was dependent upon Israel for water electricity sewage communication networks and for its trade (Gisha 2007.

Its southwest point (at Raphia, Tell Rifa\u1e25, southwest of Gaza) is about 34\u00b0 15\u2032 E. longitude, and its northwest point (mouth of the Li\u1e6dani) is at 35\u00b0 15\u2032 E. longitude, while the course of the Jordan reaches 35\u00b0 35\u2032 to the east. The west-Jordan country has, consequently, a length of about 150 English miles from north to south, and a breadth of about {{convert|23|mi|0|abbr=out}} at the north and {{convert|80|mi|0|abbr=out}} at the south. The area of this region, as measured by the surveyors of the English Palestine Exploration Fund, is about {{convert|6040|mi2|0|abbr=out}}. The east-Jordan district is now being surveyed by the German Pal\u00e4stina-Verein, and although the work is not yet completed, its area may be estimated at {{convert|4000|mi2|0|abbr=out}}. This entire region, as stated above, was not occupied exclusively by the Israelites, for the plain along the coast in the south belonged to the Philistines, and that in the north to the Phoenicians, while in the east-Jordan country, the Israelitic possessions never extended farther than the Arnon (Wadi al-Mujib) in the south, nor did the Israelites ever settle in the most northerly and easterly portions of the plain of Bashan. To-day the number of inhabitants does not exceed 650,000. Palestine, and especially the Israelitic state, covered, therefore, a very small area, approximating that of the state of Vermont.\" From the Jewish Encyclopedia}}{{efn-lr|According to the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition]] (1911), Palestine is:{{sfn|EB|1911}} \"[A] geographical name of rather loose application. Etymological strictness would require it to denote exclusively the narrow strip of coast-land once occupied by the Philistines, from whose name it is derived. It is, however, conventionally used as a name for the territory which, in the Old Testament, is claimed as the inheritance of the pre-exilic Hebrews; thus it may be said generally to denote the southern third of the province of Syria. Except in the west, where the country is bordered by the Mediterranean Sea, the limit of this territory cannot be laid down on the map as a definite line. The modern subdivisions under the jurisdiction of the Ottoman Empire are in no sense conterminous with those of antiquity, and hence do not afford a boundary by which Palestine can be separated exactly from the rest of Syria in the north, or from the Sinaitic and Arabian deserts in the south and east; nor are the records of ancient boundaries sufficiently full and definite to make possible the complete demarcation of the country. Even the convention above referred to is inexact: it includes the Philistine territory, claimed but never settled by the Hebrews, and excludes the outlying parts of the large area claimed in Num. xxxiv. as the Hebrew possession (from the \" River of Egypt \" to Hamath). However, the Hebrews themselves have preserved, in the proverbial expression \" from Dan to Beersheba \" (Judg. xx.i, &c.), an indication of the normal north-and-south limits of their land; and in defining the area of the country under discussion it is this indication which is generally followed. Taking as a guide the natural features most nearly corresponding to these outlying points, we may describe Palestine as the strip of land extending along the eastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea from the mouth of the Litany or Kasimiya River (33\u00b0 20' N.) southward to the mouth of the Wadi Ghuzza; the latter joins the sea in 31\u00b0 28' N., a short distance south of Gaza, and runs thence in a south-easterly direction so as to include on its northern side the site of Beersheba. Eastward there is no such definite border. The River Jordan, it is true, marks a line of [[delimitation]] between Western and [[Transjordan (region)|Eastern Palestine]]; but it is practically impossible to say where the latter ends and the Arabian desert begins. Perhaps the line of the pilgrim road from Damascus to Mecca is the most convenient possible boundary. The total length of the region is about {{convert|140|m|2|abbr=on}}; its breadth west of the Jordan ranges from about {{convert|23|m|2|abbr=on}} in the north to about {{convert|80|m|2|abbr=on}} in the south.\"}} The [[Jordan Rift Valley]] (comprising Wadi Arabah, the [[Dead Sea]] and [[River Jordan]]) has at times formed a political and administrative frontier, even within empires that have controlled both territories.<ref name=\"Aharoni1979\">{{cite book|author=Yohanan Aharoni|title=The Land of the Bible: A Historical Geography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AMtoyNxWw0UC|date=1 January 1979|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-0-664-24266-4|quote=The desert served as an eastern boundary in times when Transjordan was occupied.

It encompasses two theme parks, many resort hotels, Disney Nature Resorts, a shopping, dining, and entertainment complex, and a golf course, in addition to several additional recreational and entertainment venues. [[Disneyland Park (Paris)|Disneyland Park]] is the original theme park of the complex, opening with the resort on 12 April 1992. A second theme park, [[Walt Disney Studios Park]], opened in 2002, 10 years after the original park. Disneyland Paris celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2017. Within 25 years of opening, 320 million people visited Disneyland Paris, making it the most visited theme park in Europe.<ref name=ParisDigest>{{Cite web |url=https://www.parisdigest.com/paris/disneyland-paris.htm |title=Disneyland Paris facts and information |author= | year=2018 |publisher=Paris Digest |accessdate=2018-09-09}}</ref> The Parisian resort is the second [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney park]] to open outside the United States following the opening of the [[Tokyo Disney Resort]] in 1983 and is the largest Disney resort to open outside of the United States. Disneyland Paris is also the only Disney resort outside of the United States to be completely owned by The Walt Disney Company.\n\n==Ownership==\nWalt Disney announced a \u20ac1 billion ($1.25 billion) bailout plan to rescue its subsidiary Disneyland Paris, the Financial Times reported on 6 October 2014.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/332bbed8-4d2c-11e4-8f75-00144feab7de|title=Euro Disney faces \u20ac1bn bailout by Walt Disney parent|last=Carnegy|first=Hugh|date=6 October 2014|work=Financial Times|accessdate=22 August 2018}}</ref> The park is burdened by its debt, which is calculated at about \u20ac1.75 billion ($2.20 billion) and roughly 15 times its gross average earnings.\n\nUntil June 2017, Disney only held a minority stake in the resort, when they bought the remaining shares. In 2017, [[The Walt Disney Company]] offered an informal takeover of Euro Disney S.C.A., buying 9% of the company from [[Kingdom Holding]] and an open offer of 2 euros per share for the remaining stock. This brought The Walt Disney Company's total ownership to 85.7%. The Walt Disney company will also invest an additional 1.5 Billion euros to strengthen the company.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://weloveorlandofl.com/breaking-disney-company-takes-full-ownership-of-disneyland-paris/|title=The Walt Disney Company takes full ownership of Disneyland Paris Resort|date=13 June 2017|website=We Love Orlando|access-date=13 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Seeking a location for a European resort===\n\nFollowing the success of Disneyland in California and Walt Disney World in Florida, plans to build a similar theme park in Europe emerged In 1972. Under the leadership of [[E. Cardon Walker]], [[Tokyo Disneyland]] opened in 1983 in Japan with instant success, forming a catalyst for international expansion. In late 1984 the heads of Disney's theme park division, Dick Nunis and Jim Cora, presented a list of approximately 1,200 possible European locations for the park. Britain, France, Italy and Spain were all considered. However, Britain and Italy were dropped from the list due to both lacking a suitable expanse of flat land. By March 1985, the number of possible locations for the park had been reduced to four; two in France and two in Spain. Both nations saw the potential economic advantages of a Disney theme park and offered competing financing deals to Disney.\n\nBoth Spanish sites were located near the Mediterranean and offered a subtropical climate similar to Disney's parks in California and Florida. Disney had asked each site to provide average temperatures for every month for the previous 40 years, which proved a complicated endeavour as none of the records were computerised and were registered on paper.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.levante-emv.com/valencia/2012/06/14/ano-valencia-sono-disney/913079.html|title=El a\u00f1o en que Valencia so\u00f1\u00f3 con la Disney [The year that Valencia dreamed about Disney]|work=[[Levante-EMV]] (in Spanish)|date=14 June 2012|accessdate=14 August 2018}}</ref> The site in [[Pego, Alicante]] became the front-runner, but the location was controversial as it would have meant the destruction of Marjal de Pego-Oliva marshlands, a site of natural beauty and one of the last homes of the almost extinct [[Samaruc]] or Valencia Toothcarp, so there was some local outcry among environmentalists.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://lamarinaplaza.com/2018/01/14/1985-el-ano-en-que-disney-casi-se-instala-en-pego/|title=El a\u00f1o en que Disney casi se instala en Pego [The year that Disney almost set up in Pego]|work=[[La Marina Plaza]] (in Spanish)|date=14 January 2018|accessdate=14 August 2018}}</ref> Disney had also shown interest in a site near [[Toulon]] in [[southern France]], not far from [[Marseille]]. The pleasing landscape of that region, as well as its climate, made the location a top competitor for what would be called Euro Disneyland. However, shallow bedrock was encountered beneath the site, which would have rendered construction too difficult. Finally, a site in the rural town of Marne-la-Vall\u00e9e was chosen because of its proximity to Paris and its central location in Western Europe. This location was estimated to be no more than a four-hour drive for 68 million people and no more than a two-hour flight for a further 300&nbsp;million.\n\n[[Michael Eisner]], Disney's CEO at the time, signed the first letter of agreement with the [[Cabinet of France|French government]] for the {{convert|20|km2|acre|-1|adj=on}} site on 18 December 1985, and the first financial contracts were drawn up during the following spring.

In order to accomplish this, 29 restaurants were built inside the park (with a further 11 restaurants built at the Euro Disney resort hotels and five at Festival Disney). [[Menu]]s and prices were varied with an American flavour predominant and Disney's precedent of serving alcoholic beverages was continued in the park.\n\n2,300 [[patio]] seats (30% of park seating) were installed to satisfy Europeans' expected preference of eating outdoors in good weather. In [[test kitchen]]s at Walt Disney World, recipes were adapted for European tastes.

We are who we are.\"<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\nTopics of controversy also included Disney's American managers requiring English to be spoken at all meetings and Disney's appearance code for members of staff, which listed regulations and limitations for the use of makeup, facial hair, tattoos, jewellery, and more.\n\nFrench labour unions mounted protests against the appearance code, which they saw as \"an attack on individual liberty\". Others criticised Disney as being insensitive to French culture, individualism, and privacy, because restrictions on individual or collective liberties were illegal under [[French law]], unless it could be demonstrated that the restrictions are requisite to the job and do not exceed what is necessary.\n\nDisney countered by saying that a ruling that barred them from imposing such an employment standard could threaten the image and long-term success of the park. \"For us, the appearance code has a great effect from a product identification standpoint,\" said Thor Degelmann, Euro Disney's personnel director. \"Without it we couldn't be presenting the Disney product that people would be expecting.\"<ref>Anne Ferguson, ''Maximising the Mouse.''

During this time visitors were mostly park employees and their family members, who tested facilities and operations. The press were able to visit the day before the park's opening day on 12 April.\n\nOn 12 April 1992, Euro Disney Resort and its theme park, Euro Disneyland, officially opened.  Visitors were warned of chaos on the roads. A government survey indicated that half a million people carried by 90,000 cars might attempt to enter the complex. French radio warned traffic to avoid the area. By midday, the car park was approximately half full, suggesting an attendance level below 25,000. Explanations of the lower-than-expected turnout included speculation that people heeded the advice to stay away and that the one-day strike that cut the direct [[R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional|RER]] railway connection to Euro Disney from the centre of Paris made the park inaccessible.<ref name=\"thunderbird\"/> Due to the European recession that August, the park faced financial difficulties as there were a lack of things to do and an overabundance of hotels, leading to underperformance.<ref name=\"Disneyland Paris Brief History\">{{cite web|last=Solarius|title=Disneyland Paris Brief History|url=http://www.solarius.com/dvp/dlp/dlp-history.htm|publisher=Solarius|accessdate=28 February 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211162227/http://www.solarius.com/dvp/dlp/dlp-history.htm|archivedate=11 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nA new Indiana Jones roller-coaster ride was opened at Euro Disney in 1993.

There were rumours that Euro Disney was getting close to having to file for bankruptcy. The banks and the backers had meetings to work out some of the financial problems facing Euro Disney. In March 1994 Team Disney went into negotiations with the banks so that they could get some help for their debt. As a last resort, the Walt Disney Company threatened to close the Disneyland Paris park, leaving the banks with the land.<ref name=\"Disneyland Paris Brief History\"/>\n\n===Financial, attendance and employment struggles===\n[[File:Lake of Disney Village 2.jpg|thumb|left|Disney's Newport Bay Club]]\nIn May 1992, entertainment magazine ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' reported that about 25% of Euro Disney's workforce \u2013 approximately 3,000 people \u2013 had resigned from their jobs because of unacceptable working conditions. It also reported that the park's attendance was far behind expectations. The disappointing attendance can be at least partly explained by the [[Early 1990s recession|recession]] and increased unemployment, which was affecting France and most of the rest of the developed world at this time; when construction of the resort began, the economy was still on an upswing.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSSP40009620090304 | work=Reuters | title=FACTBOX:Who's next?

Prices at the hotels were reduced.\n \nDespite these efforts in May 1992, park attendance was around 25,000 (some reports give a figure of 30,000) instead of the predicted 60,000. The Euro Disney Company stock price spiralled downwards and on 23 July 1992, Euro Disney announced an expected net loss in its first year of operation of approximately 300 million [[French franc]]s. During Euro Disney's first winter, hotel occupancy was so low that it was decided to close the [[Disney's Newport Bay Club|Newport Bay Club]] hotel during the season.\n\nInitial hopes were that each visitor would spend around US$33 per day, but near the end of 1992, analysts found spending to be around 12% lower.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/disney-faq/disneyland-paris/ |title=Disneyland Paris (Euro Disney) Frequently Asked Questions \u2013 1996, Andre Willey/Tom Drynda |publisher=Faqs.org |accessdate=23 September 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922165130/http://www.faqs.org/faqs/disney-faq/disneyland-paris/ |archivedate=22 September 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Efforts to improve attendance included serving alcoholic beverages with meals inside the Euro Disneyland park, in response to a presumed European demand, which began 12 June 1993.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEEDF1E3FF931A25755C0A965958260|date= 12 June 1993|title=Euro Disney Adding Alcohol |work=The New York Times |accessdate=23 September 2009}}</ref>\n\nBy the summer of 1994, Euro Disney was burdened with $3 billion worth of debt.

It opened on 1 April 1992 and is notably served by [[R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional|regional express]] line [[RER A]] which provides a direct connection with the centre of Paris and for further connections, direct to Paris - Gare de Lyon.\n\nThe railway station is also served by long-distance high-speed [[TGV]] and [[Ouigo]] trains offering direct services to many cities across France.  There are services from and to [[St Pancras railway station|London St Pancras International]], Ebbsfleet International and Ashford International by [[Eurostar]]. There are also Thalys services to both Brussels and Amsterdam.\n\nFree shuttle buses provide transport to all Disney hotels and Les Villages Nature<sup>\u00ae</sup> Paris (except Disney's Davy Crockett Ranch) and Associated Hotels.\n\n===Backstage Disney===\nDisneyland Paris has strict rules designed to prevent guests from seeing backstage areas of the park. Photography and filming are strictly forbidden in all backstage areas. The edges of the parks are lined with ride buildings and foliage to hide areas that are not for the public to see. Numerous area gates allow entrance into the park for cast members, parade floats, etc. When area gates around the park are open, anything that can be seen through them is considered to be on-stage and part of the Disney Magic. Therefore, from the moment the gates are open, all of the cast must be in character and in place to 'perform'. As the complex is so big, shuttle buses take cast members to different parts of the parks via service roads located around the perimeter of the parks.\n\nMany attractions are housed in large, soundstage-like buildings called \"show buildings\", some of which are partially or completely disguised by external theming. Most show buildings have off-white flat roofs that support HVAC units and footpaths for maintenance cast members. Housed inside show buildings are the actual attractions, which include hidden walkways, service areas, control rooms, and other backstage operations.\n\n===Attendance===\n<timeline>\nImageSize = width:777 height:336\n\n#hoogte yas 200px-30px marge is 170px voor grafiek\n\nPlotArea = left:70 right:10 top:10 bottom:20\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal\nAlignBars = justify\nColors =\n id:gray1 value:gray(0.9)\n\nDateFormat = yyyy\nPeriod = from:1992 till:2020\n\nScaleMajor = unit:year increment:2 start:1992\nPlotData =\n bar:16000000 color:gray1 width:1 #gridlijn ywaarde8_3\n from:start till:end\n bar:14000000 color:gray1 width:1 #gridlijn ywaarde7_3\n from:start till:end\n bar:12000000 color:gray1 width:1 #gridlijn ywaarde6_3\n from:start till:end\n bar:10000000 color:gray1 width:1 #gridlijn ywaarde5_3\n from:start till:end\n bar:8000000 color:gray1 #gridlijn ywaarde4_3\n from:start till:end\n bar:6000000 color:gray1 #gridlijn ywaarde3_3\n from:start till:end\n bar:4000000 color:gray1 #gridlijn ywaarde2_3\n from:start till:end\n bar:2000000 color:gray1 #gridlijn ywaarde1_3\n from:start till:end\n bar:0 color:gray1\n\n# berekening van xwaarde punt: 70+((jaartal-jaartalminimum)\u00d725)\n# berekening van ywaarde punt: 20+((305/16.000.000)\u00d7bezoekers)\n\nLineData =\n layer:front\n points:(70,180)(75,180) color:blue width:2 #1992: 8.400.000\n points:(75,180)(95,207) color:blue width:2 #1993: 9.800.000\n points:(95,207)(120,188) color:blue width:2 #1994: 8.800.000\n points:(120,188)(145,235) color:blue width:2 #1995: 11.300.000\n points:(145,235)(170,245) color:blue width:2 #1996: 11.800.000\n points:(170,245)(195,264) color:blue width:2 #1997: 12.800.000\n points:(195,264)(220,258) color:blue width:2 #1998: 12.500.000\n points:(220,258)(245,258) color:blue width:2 #1999: 12.500.000\n points:(245,258)(270,249) color:blue width:2 #2000: 12.000.000\n points:(270,249)(295,251) color:blue width:2 #2001: 12.100.000\n points:(295,251)(320,275) color:blue width:2 #2002: 13.400.000\n points:(320,275)(345,256) color:blue width:2 #2003: 12.400.000\n points:(345,256)(370,254) color:blue width:2 #2004: 12.300.000\n points:(370,254)(395,254) color:blue width:2 #2005: 12.300.000\n points:(395,254)(420,270) color:blue width:2 #2006: 13.100.000\n points:(420,270)(445,296) color:blue width:2 #2007: 14.500.000\n points:(445,296)(470,312) color:blue width:2 #2008: 15.300.000\n points:(470,312)(495,314) color:blue width:2 #2009: 15.400.690\n points:(495,314)(520,309) color:blue width:2 #2010: 15.158.800\n points:(520,309)(545,319) color:blue width:2 #2011: 15.700.000\n points:(545,319)(570,325) color:blue width:2 #2012: 16.000.000\n points:(570,325)(595,304) color:blue width:2 #2013: 14.900.000\n points:(595,304)(620,291) color:blue width:2 #2014: 14.200.000\n points:(620,291)(645,302) color:blue width:2 #2015: 14.800.000\n points:(645,302)(670,275) color:blue width:2 #2016: 13.400.000\n points:(670,275)(695,303) color:blue width:2 #2017: 14.860.000\n #points:(695,303)(720,???) color:blue width:2 #2018: ???\n #points:(720,???)(745,???) color:blue width:2 #2019: ???\n #points:(745,???)(770,???) color:blue width:2 #2020: ???\n\n</timeline>\n* 2009 -

[[Disneyland Park (Paris)|Disneyland Park]] is the original theme park of the complex, opening with the resort on 12 April 1992. A second theme park, [[Walt Disney Studios Park]], opened in 2002, 10 years after the original park. Disneyland Paris celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2017. Within 25 years of opening, 320 million people visited Disneyland Paris, making it the most visited theme park in Europe.<ref name=ParisDigest>{{Cite web |url=https://www.parisdigest.com/paris/disneyland-paris.htm |title=Disneyland Paris facts and information |author= | year=2018 |publisher=Paris Digest |accessdate=2018-09-09}}</ref> The Parisian resort is the second [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney park]] to open outside the United States following the opening of the [[Tokyo Disney Resort]] in 1983 and is the largest Disney resort to open outside of the United States. Disneyland Paris is also the only Disney resort outside of the United States to be completely owned by The Walt Disney Company.\n\n==Ownership==\nWalt Disney announced a \u20ac1 billion ($1.25 billion) bailout plan to rescue its subsidiary Disneyland Paris, the Financial Times reported on 6 October 2014.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/332bbed8-4d2c-11e4-8f75-00144feab7de|title=Euro Disney faces \u20ac1bn bailout by Walt Disney parent|last=Carnegy|first=Hugh|date=6 October 2014|work=Financial Times|accessdate=22 August 2018}}</ref> The park is burdened by its debt, which is calculated at about \u20ac1.75 billion ($2.20 billion) and roughly 15 times its gross average earnings.\n\nUntil June 2017, Disney only held a minority stake in the resort, when they bought the remaining shares. In 2017, [[The Walt Disney Company]] offered an informal takeover of Euro Disney S.C.A., buying 9% of the company from [[Kingdom Holding]] and an open offer of 2 euros per share for the remaining stock. This brought The Walt Disney Company's total ownership to 85.7%.

Under the leadership of [[E. Cardon Walker]], [[Tokyo Disneyland]] opened in 1983 in Japan with instant success, forming a catalyst for international expansion. In late 1984 the heads of Disney's theme park division, Dick Nunis and Jim Cora, presented a list of approximately 1,200 possible European locations for the park. Britain, France, Italy and Spain were all considered. However, Britain and Italy were dropped from the list due to both lacking a suitable expanse of flat land. By March 1985, the number of possible locations for the park had been reduced to four; two in France and two in Spain. Both nations saw the potential economic advantages of a Disney theme park and offered competing financing deals to Disney.\n\nBoth Spanish sites were located near the Mediterranean and offered a subtropical climate similar to Disney's parks in California and Florida. Disney had asked each site to provide average temperatures for every month for the previous 40 years, which proved a complicated endeavour as none of the records were computerised and were registered on paper.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.levante-emv.com/valencia/2012/06/14/ano-valencia-sono-disney/913079.html|title=El a\u00f1o en que Valencia so\u00f1\u00f3 con la Disney [The year that Valencia dreamed about Disney]|work=[[Levante-EMV]] (in Spanish)|date=14 June 2012|accessdate=14 August 2018}}</ref> The site in [[Pego, Alicante]] became the front-runner, but the location was controversial as it would have meant the destruction of Marjal de Pego-Oliva marshlands, a site of natural beauty and one of the last homes of the almost extinct [[Samaruc]] or Valencia Toothcarp, so there was some local outcry among environmentalists.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://lamarinaplaza.com/2018/01/14/1985-el-ano-en-que-disney-casi-se-instala-en-pego/|title=El a\u00f1o en que Disney casi se instala en Pego [The year that Disney almost set up in Pego]|work=[[La Marina Plaza]] (in Spanish)|date=14 January 2018|accessdate=14 August 2018}}</ref> Disney had also shown interest in a site near [[Toulon]] in [[southern France]], not far from [[Marseille]]. The pleasing landscape of that region, as well as its climate, made the location a top competitor for what would be called Euro Disneyland. However, shallow bedrock was encountered beneath the site, which would have rendered construction too difficult. Finally, a site in the rural town of Marne-la-Vall\u00e9e was chosen because of its proximity to Paris and its central location in Western Europe. This location was estimated to be no more than a four-hour drive for 68 million people and no more than a two-hour flight for a further 300&nbsp;million.\n\n[[Michael Eisner]], Disney's CEO at the time, signed the first letter of agreement with the [[Cabinet of France|French government]] for the {{convert|20|km2|acre|-1|adj=on}} site on 18 December 1985, and the first financial contracts were drawn up during the following spring. The final contract was signed by the leaders of the Walt Disney Company and the French government and [[Territorial collectivity|territorial collectivities]] on 24 March 1987.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|title=The Main Agreement of 1987: paving the way for Disneyland Paris|url=http://disneylandparis-news.com/en/the-main-agreement-of-1987-paving-the-way-for-disneyland-paris/|work=Disneyland Paris News|date=30 January 2017|accessdate=27 June 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190323115621/http://disneylandparis-news.com/en/the-main-agreement-of-1987-paving-the-way-for-disneyland-paris/|archivedate=23 March 2019}}</ref> Construction began in August 1988, and in December 1990, an information centre named \"Espace Euro Disney\" was opened to show the public what was being constructed.

In order to accomplish this, 29 restaurants were built inside the park (with a further 11 restaurants built at the Euro Disney resort hotels and five at Festival Disney). [[Menu]]s and prices were varied with an American flavour predominant and Disney's precedent of serving alcoholic beverages was continued in the park.\n\n2,300 [[patio]] seats (30% of park seating) were installed to satisfy Europeans' expected preference of eating outdoors in good weather. In [[test kitchen]]s at Walt Disney World, recipes were adapted for European tastes. Walter Meyer, executive [[chef]] for menu development at Euro Disney and executive chef of food projects development at Walt Disney World noted, \"A few things we did need to change, but most of the time people kept telling us, 'Do your own thing.

It is we who adore it, who adopt its fashions and above all, its words.\" Euro Disney S.C.A.'s then-chairman [[Robert Fitzpatrick (art executive)|Robert Fitzpatrick]] responded, \"We didn't come in and say O.K., we're going to put a [[beret]] and a [[baguette]] on [[Mickey Mouse]]. We are who we are.\"<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\nTopics of controversy also included Disney's American managers requiring English to be spoken at all meetings and Disney's appearance code for members of staff, which listed regulations and limitations for the use of makeup, facial hair, tattoos, jewellery, and more.\n\nFrench labour unions mounted protests against the appearance code, which they saw as \"an attack on individual liberty\". Others criticised Disney as being insensitive to French culture, individualism, and privacy, because restrictions on individual or collective liberties were illegal under [[French law]], unless it could be demonstrated that the restrictions are requisite to the job and do not exceed what is necessary.\n\nDisney countered by saying that a ruling that barred them from imposing such an employment standard could threaten the image and long-term success of the park. \"For us, the appearance code has a great effect from a product identification standpoint,\" said Thor Degelmann, Euro Disney's personnel director. \"Without it we couldn't be presenting the Disney product that people would be expecting.\"<ref>Anne Ferguson, ''Maximising the Mouse.'' ''Management Today'', September 1989, pp. 60.</ref>\n\n===Opening day and early years===\nEuro Disney opened for employee preview and testing in March 1992. During this time visitors were mostly park employees and their family members, who tested facilities and operations. The press were able to visit the day before the park's opening day on 12 April.\n\nOn 12 April 1992, Euro Disney Resort and its theme park, Euro Disneyland, officially opened.  Visitors were warned of chaos on the roads. A government survey indicated that half a million people carried by 90,000 cars might attempt to enter the complex. French radio warned traffic to avoid the area. By midday, the car park was approximately half full, suggesting an attendance level below 25,000. Explanations of the lower-than-expected turnout included speculation that people heeded the advice to stay away and that the one-day strike that cut the direct [[R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional|RER]] railway connection to Euro Disney from the centre of Paris made the park inaccessible.<ref name=\"thunderbird\"/> Due to the European recession that August, the park faced financial difficulties as there were a lack of things to do and an overabundance of hotels, leading to underperformance.<ref name=\"Disneyland Paris Brief History\">{{cite web|last=Solarius|title=Disneyland Paris Brief History|url=http://www.solarius.com/dvp/dlp/dlp-history.htm|publisher=Solarius|accessdate=28 February 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211162227/http://www.solarius.com/dvp/dlp/dlp-history.htm|archivedate=11 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nA new Indiana Jones roller-coaster ride was opened at Euro Disney in 1993.

There were rumours that Euro Disney was getting close to having to file for bankruptcy. The banks and the backers had meetings to work out some of the financial problems facing Euro Disney. In March 1994 Team Disney went into negotiations with the banks so that they could get some help for their debt. As a last resort, the Walt Disney Company threatened to close the Disneyland Paris park, leaving the banks with the land.<ref name=\"Disneyland Paris Brief History\"/>\n\n===Financial, attendance and employment struggles===\n[[File:Lake of Disney Village 2.jpg|thumb|left|Disney's Newport Bay Club]]\nIn May 1992, entertainment magazine ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' reported that about 25% of Euro Disney's workforce \u2013 approximately 3,000 people \u2013 had resigned from their jobs because of unacceptable working conditions. It also reported that the park's attendance was far behind expectations. The disappointing attendance can be at least partly explained by the [[Early 1990s recession|recession]] and increased unemployment, which was affecting France and most of the rest of the developed world at this time; when construction of the resort began, the economy was still on an upswing.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSSP40009620090304 | work=Reuters | title=FACTBOX:Who's next?

In response to the financial situation, Fitzpatrick ordered that the Disney-MGM Studios Europe project would be put on hiatus until a further decision could be made. Prices at the hotels were reduced.\n \nDespite these efforts in May 1992, park attendance was around 25,000 (some reports give a figure of 30,000) instead of the predicted 60,000. The Euro Disney Company stock price spiralled downwards and on 23 July 1992, Euro Disney announced an expected net loss in its first year of operation of approximately 300 million [[French franc]]s. During Euro Disney's first winter, hotel occupancy was so low that it was decided to close the [[Disney's Newport Bay Club|Newport Bay Club]] hotel during the season.\n\nInitial hopes were that each visitor would spend around US$33 per day, but near the end of 1992, analysts found spending to be around 12% lower.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/disney-faq/disneyland-paris/ |title=Disneyland Paris (Euro Disney) Frequently Asked Questions \u2013 1996, Andre Willey/Tom Drynda |publisher=Faqs.org |accessdate=23 September 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922165130/http://www.faqs.org/faqs/disney-faq/disneyland-paris/ |archivedate=22 September 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Efforts to improve attendance included serving alcoholic beverages with meals inside the Euro Disneyland park, in response to a presumed European demand, which began 12 June 1993.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEEDF1E3FF931A25755C0A965958260|date= 12 June 1993|title=Euro Disney Adding Alcohol |work=The New York Times |accessdate=23 September 2009}}</ref>\n\nBy the summer of 1994, Euro Disney was burdened with $3 billion worth of debt.

It opened on 1 April 1992 and is notably served by [[R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional|regional express]] line [[RER A]] which provides a direct connection with the centre of Paris and for further connections, direct to Paris - Gare de Lyon.\n\nThe railway station is also served by long-distance high-speed [[TGV]] and [[Ouigo]] trains offering direct services to many cities across France.  There are services from and to [[St Pancras railway station|London St Pancras International]], Ebbsfleet International and Ashford International by [[Eurostar]]. There are also Thalys services to both Brussels and Amsterdam.\n\nFree shuttle buses provide transport to all Disney hotels and Les Villages Nature<sup>\u00ae</sup> Paris (except Disney's Davy Crockett Ranch) and Associated Hotels.\n\n===Backstage Disney===\nDisneyland Paris has strict rules designed to prevent guests from seeing backstage areas of the park. Photography and filming are strictly forbidden in all backstage areas. The edges of the parks are lined with ride buildings and foliage to hide areas that are not for the public to see. Numerous area gates allow entrance into the park for cast members, parade floats, etc. When area gates around the park are open, anything that can be seen through them is considered to be on-stage and part of the Disney Magic. Therefore, from the moment the gates are open, all of the cast must be in character and in place to 'perform'. As the complex is so big, shuttle buses take cast members to different parts of the parks via service roads located around the perimeter of the parks.\n\nMany attractions are housed in large, soundstage-like buildings called \"show buildings\", some of which are partially or completely disguised by external theming. Most show buildings have off-white flat roofs that support HVAC units and footpaths for maintenance cast members. Housed inside show buildings are the actual attractions, which include hidden walkways, service areas, control rooms, and other backstage operations.\n\n===Attendance===\n<timeline>\nImageSize = width:777 height:336\n\n#hoogte yas 200px-30px marge is 170px voor grafiek\n\nPlotArea = left:70 right:10 top:10 bottom:20\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal\nAlignBars = justify\nColors =\n id:gray1 value:gray(0.9)\n\nDateFormat = yyyy\nPeriod = from:1992 till:2020\n\nScaleMajor = unit:year increment:2 start:1992\nPlotData =\n bar:16000000 color:gray1 width:1 #gridlijn ywaarde8_3\n from:start till:end\n bar:14000000 color:gray1 width:1 #gridlijn ywaarde7_3\n from:start till:end\n bar:12000000 color:gray1 width:1 #gridlijn ywaarde6_3\n from:start till:end\n bar:10000000 color:gray1 width:1 #gridlijn ywaarde5_3\n from:start till:end\n bar:8000000 color:gray1 #gridlijn ywaarde4_3\n from:start till:end\n bar:6000000 color:gray1 #gridlijn ywaarde3_3\n from:start till:end\n bar:4000000 color:gray1 #gridlijn ywaarde2_3\n from:start till:end\n bar:2000000 color:gray1 #gridlijn ywaarde1_3\n from:start till:end\n bar:0 color:gray1\n\n# berekening van xwaarde punt: 70+((jaartal-jaartalminimum)\u00d725)\n# berekening van ywaarde punt: 20+((305/16.000.000)\u00d7bezoekers)\n\nLineData =\n layer:front\n points:(70,180)(75,180) color:blue width:2 #1992: 8.400.000\n points:(75,180)(95,207) color:blue width:2 #1993: 9.800.000\n points:(95,207)(120,188) color:blue width:2 #1994: 8.800.000\n points:(120,188)(145,235) color:blue width:2 #1995: 11.300.000\n points:(145,235)(170,245) color:blue width:2 #1996: 11.800.000\n points:(170,245)(195,264) color:blue width:2 #1997: 12.800.000\n points:(195,264)(220,258) color:blue width:2 #1998: 12.500.000\n points:(220,258)(245,258) color:blue width:2 #1999: 12.500.000\n points:(245,258)(270,249) color:blue width:2 #2000: 12.000.000\n points:(270,249)(295,251) color:blue width:2 #2001: 12.100.000\n points:(295,251)(320,275) color:blue width:2 #2002: 13.400.000\n points:(320,275)(345,256) color:blue width:2 #2003: 12.400.000\n points:(345,256)(370,254) color:blue width:2 #2004: 12.300.000\n points:(370,254)(395,254) color:blue width:2 #2005: 12.300.000\n points:(395,254)(420,270) color:blue width:2 #2006: 13.100.000\n points:(420,270)(445,296) color:blue width:2 #2007: 14.500.000\n points:(445,296)(470,312) color:blue width:2 #2008: 15.300.000\n points:(470,312)(495,314) color:blue width:2 #2009: 15.400.690\n points:(495,314)(520,309) color:blue width:2 #2010: 15.158.800\n points:(520,309)(545,319) color:blue width:2 #2011: 15.700.000\n points:(545,319)(570,325) color:blue width:2 #2012: 16.000.000\n points:(570,325)(595,304) color:blue width:2 #2013: 14.900.000\n points:(595,304)(620,291) color:blue width:2 #2014: 14.200.000\n points:(620,291)(645,302) color:blue width:2 #2015: 14.800.000\n points:(645,302)(670,275) color:blue width:2 #2016: 13.400.000\n points:(670,275)(695,303) color:blue width:2 #2017: 14.860.000\n #points:(695,303)(720,???) color:blue width:2 #2018: ???\n #points:(720,???)(745,???) color:blue width:2 #2019: ???\n #points:(745,???)(770,???) color:blue width:2 #2020: ???\n\n</timeline>\n* 2009 -
