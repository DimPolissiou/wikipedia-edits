He opened his own machine shop called Wesco Tool, where he experienced great success making airplane parts. In the late 1950s Butler started sailing dinghies, and as his family grew he desired a bigger boat.\n\nHe set his eyes on the 21\u2019 Victory Sloop, designed by Naval Architect Ted Carpenter and first launched in 1959. He contracted with the boat builder to make him one, but the builder ran out of funds. Butler gave the builder a loan. Unable to repay the debt, the builder gave Butler the tooling to continue building the boat himself. In 1962 after 126 Victory 21 boats were manufactured, the rights for the Victory 21 were sold to Frank Butler who founded a second company he named Wesco Marine.\n\n== The Coronado years ==\nA short while after producing boats under the name of Wesco Marine, Butler changed the name of Wesco Marine to Coronado Yachts. Among the first boats built by Coronado were the Victory 21 and the 14\u2019 [[Super Satellite]]. The first notable boat design by Butler was the Coronado 25, which incorporated his knowledge from his work in the airplane industry.\n\nIn 1968 Butler sold Coronado to the Whittaker Corporation, which had divisions in aerospace, metal, chemical, and healthcare, and had already purchased [[Columbia Yachts]] from Dick Valdes in 1967. Whittaker had also acquired several power boat manufacturers. Butler worked for Whitaker for one year, and then left due to disagreements with management over the production of a trailerable {{convert|22|ft|m|adj=on}} boat with a movable keel.\n\nDick Valdes left Whittaker in 1972, and eventually many of the Columbia models became cross-branded with Coronados. In 1974 Whitaker discontinued the Coronado line.\n\n== The Catalina years ==\nButler had a non-competition contract with Whittaker for two years, so his boat building was limited to the smaller ones for which Whittaker hadn't bought the rights. Butler built a marina in Oxnard, Calif, and founded Catalina Yachts. His first new product was the trailerable {{convert|22|ft|m|adj=on}} Catalina with a movable keel, and he continued to build the smaller boats, such as the [[Coronado 15]], the Omega, the [[Super Satellite]], and the Drifter. Butler\u2019s employee and right-hand man, Beattie says, \"We wanted to change the name of [[the Coronado 15]] to make it obvious the boat wasn't built by Coronado Yachts, but couldn't because the class association wouldn't let us.\u201d Shortly after its founding, Catalina Yachts acquired the manufacturing rights to the Victory 21, and later resumed its production selling the Victory as a Capri Victory 21.\n\nBy 1977 Butler had designed and produced three more models: the Catalina 25, Catalina 27, and the Catalina 30. In 1978 Catalina developed the [[Catalina 38]] based on molds for a [[Sparkman & Stephens]] racing design purchased from the bankrupt Yankee Yacht Company. Butler redesigned the interior and gave it a \"Catalina deck\", taller mast, shorter boom, and moved the rudder.\n\n== The Capri, Morgan, Prindle, Islander, and Pearson years ==\nThe Capri line of sailboats, developed under the Capri Sailboat Division, are the performance-oriented daysailers of Catalina. The Capri models range from 8 to {{convert|25|ft|m}}.\n\nIn 1984 Catalina expanded their manufacturing capabilities by acquiring Morgan Yachts, of which Catalina continues to use the brand name for the Catalina Morgan 440 introduced in 2004.\n\nThe other lines produced by Catalina are the Nacra and Prindle catamarans, and the Islander 34- a powerboat made from a mold purchased from Pearson when it went out of business.\n\nWesco Marine is currently held as a separate entity which provides rigging hardware to Catalina Yachts.\n\n== Butler and Catalina today ==\nCatalina Yachts is one of the largest boat manufacturers in the world, with over 60,000 boats manufactured to date, more than 120 employees, and about {{convert|500000|sqft|m2}} of manufacturing space. Catalina produces its boats in its Florida manufacturing facility.\n\nIn 1998 Gerry Douglas, Vice President and the company's longtime chief designer & marine engineer, was named a partner in this privately owned company.

Several technical approaches have been proposed, but there has been no legal framework to date that has required satellite operators to clean up the [[negative externality]] of their derelict satellites. New approaches offer the technical prospect of markedly reducing the cost of object capture and deorbit with the implementation of a one-up/one-down [[launch license]] regime to Earth orbits that would require satellite operators to remove one spacecraft for each one deployed.<ref name=aiaa20100902_p13 >{{cite web |last=Zegler |first=Frank |title=Evolving to a Depot-Based Space Transportation Architecture |url=http://www.ulalaunch.com/uploads/docs/Published_Papers/Exploration/DepotBasedTransportationArchitecture2010.pdf |work=AIAA SPACE 2010 Conference & Exposition |publisher=AIAA |accessdate=2014-06-14 |author2=Bernard Kutter |date=2010-09-02 |pages=13\u201314 |quote=''for disposing of these obsolete or derelict spacecraft all [approaches] involve the expenditure of substantially more delta-V than what has been traditional.

The episodes include \"[[Shiver My Timbers]]\", \"[[Our Gang Follies of 1936]]\", \"[[Second Childhood (film)|Second Childhood]]\", \"[[Hearts Are Thumps]]\", \"[[Came the Brawn]]\", \"[[Bear Shooters]]\", \"[[Readin' and Writin']]\", \"[[The Pinch Singer]]\", and \"[[Teacher's Beau]]\". {{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\nIn 1979, [[Fred Wolf (animator)|Fred Wolf]] produced an animated ''[[The Little Rascals Christmas Special]]'' for [[NBC]]. That company's version was further used in animated [[public service announcement]]s.\n\n===Differences between the animated series and the live-action ''Our Gang'' films===\nThe animated series and the original live-action ''Our Gang'' films differ in a number of ways. The gang now lives in a contemporary 1980s setting, with [[computer]]s and [[television]]. Buckwheat is now a clever [[inventor]] and is interested in science, always creating new devices for the gang, and Darla's eyes were changed from hazel to blue (although this detail was trivial given that all of the ''Our Gang'' shorts were in black-and-white). Also in the animated series, the Rascals met in a treehouse and drove around the town of Greenpoint in a dog-drawn vehicle. Also, the [[theme music]] was completely different.\n\n==Lawsuit==\nIn March 1984, ''Our Gang'' actor [[Eugene Gordon Lee|Eugene Lee]], who had played Porky in the original theatrical short films as a child from 1935 to 1939, sued Hanna-Barbera Productions for nearly $2 million, claiming that the animated character was a violation of his likeness rights. He was joined in the lawsuit by other former ''Our Gang'' kids: [[George McFarland]], who had played Spanky, [[Tommy Bond]], who had played Butch, and [[Sidney Kibrick]], who had played The Woim. [[Carl Switzer]], [[Darla Hood]] and [[Billie Thomas]], who had played Alfalfa, Darla and Buckwheat respectively were already deceased. It was found that Hanna-Barbera's license from King World did not include the likeness rights of the former child actors, and the case was settled out of court.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wgAfDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Trial+by+Fire:+One+Man%27s+Battle+to+End+Corporate+Greed+and+Save+Lives&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwicv5X5qLnTAhWLOyYKHSiGCBAQ6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&q=spanky&f=false |title=Trial by Fire: One Man's Battle to End Corporate Greed and Save Lives |last=Burg |first=Mike |publisher=BenBella Books, Inc. |year=2016}}</ref>\n\n==Other languages==\nThe French dub for [[Antenne 2]], ''Les Petites Canailles'', replaced the original theme music with a new theme song, performed by a chorus of children over a montage of clips from both the theatrical ''Our Gang'' shorts and the animated shorts.\n\n==Episode titles==\n\n===Season 1===\nAired as part of ''The Pac-Man/Little Rascals/Richie Rich Show''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: #00B7EB\" width=10 | #\n! style=\"background-color: #00B7EB\" | Title/Plot\n! style=\"background-color: #00B7EB\" | Airdate\n|-\n|| 1\n|\n* '''Rascals' Revenge''': Butch and Woim lure the Rascals into a supposedly haunted house.\n* '''Yachtsa Luck''': The Rascals try to get Waldo's treasure back from a couple of robbers.\n* '''Fish Fright''': 30 second vignette.

The boundary between ionizing and non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation that occurs in the ultraviolet is not sharply defined, since different molecules and [[atom]]s ionize at [[Ionization energies of the elements (data page)|different energies]]. Conventional definition places the boundary at a [[photon energy]] between 10&nbsp;[[electronvolt|eV]] and 33&nbsp;eV in the ultraviolet (see [[Ionizing radiation#Definition boundary for lower-energy photons|definition boundary]] section below).\n\nTypical ionizing subatomic particles found in [[radioactive decay]] include [[alpha particle]]s, [[beta particle]]s and [[neutron]]s. Almost all products of radioactive decay are ionizing because the energy of radioactive decay is typically far higher than that required to ionize. Other subatomic ionizing particles which occur naturally are [[muon]]s, [[meson]]s, [[positron]]s, and other particles that constitute the secondary [[cosmic particle]]s that are produced after primary [[cosmic rays]] interact with Earth's atmosphere.<ref name=\"Woodside\">{{cite book\n |last        = Woodside\n |first       = Gayle\n |title       = Environmental, Safety, and Health Engineering\n |publisher   = John Wiley & Sons\n |year        = 1997\n |location    = US\n |pages       = 476\n |url         = https://books.google.com/books?id=SJP57-0UOzYC&pg=PA476&dq=%22ionizing+radiation\n |isbn        = 978-0471109327\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20151019172351/https://books.google.com/books?id=SJP57-0UOzYC&pg=PA476&dq=%22ionizing+radiation\n |archivedate = 2015-10-19\n}}</ref><ref name=\"Stallcup\">{{cite book\n |last        = Stallcup\n |first       = James G.\n |title       = OSHA: Stallcup's High-voltage Telecommunications Regulations Simplified\n |publisher   = Jones & Bartlett Learning\n |year        = 2006\n |location    = US\n |pages       = 133\n |url         = https://books.google.com/books?id=CpyeNUgls68C&pg=SA13-PA3&dq=%22ionizing+radiation\n |isbn        = 978-0763743475\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20151017165816/https://books.google.com/books?id=CpyeNUgls68C&pg=SA13-PA3&dq=%22ionizing+radiation\n |archivedate = 2015-10-17\n}}</ref> Cosmic rays are generated by stars and certain celestial events such as [[supernova]] explosions. [[Cosmic rays]] may also produce [[radioisotope]]s on Earth (for example, [[carbon-14]]), which in turn decay and produce ionizing radiation. Cosmic rays and the decay of radioactive [[isotopes]] are the primary sources of natural ionizing radiation on Earth referred to as [[background radiation]]. Ionizing radiation can also be generated artificially by [[X-ray tube]]s, [[particle accelerators]], and any of the various methods that produce radioisotopes artificially.\n\nIonizing radiation is not detectable by human senses, so radiation detection instruments such as [[Geiger counter]]s must be used to indicate its presence and measure it. However, high intensities can cause emission of visible light upon interaction with matter, such as in [[Cherenkov radiation]] and [[radioluminescence]]. Ionizing radiation is used in a wide variety of fields such as [[medicine]], [[nuclear power]], research, manufacturing, construction, and many other areas, but presents a health hazard if proper measures against undesired exposure are not followed. Exposure to ionizing radiation causes damage to living [[tissue (anatomy)|tissue]], and can result in [[radiation burn]]s, [[cell damage]], [[radiation sickness]], [[Radiation-induced cancer|cancer]], and [[death]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ryan|first=Julie|date=5 January 2012|title=Ionizing Radiation: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly|journal= The Journal of Investigative Dermatology|volume=132|issue=3 0 2|pages=985\u2013993|pmc=3779131|pmid=22217743|doi=10.1038/jid.2011.411}}</ref>\n\n==Types==\n{{main article|Particle radiation}}\n[[File:Alfa beta gamma neutron radiation.svg|thumb|Alpha ('''\u03b1''') radiation consists of a fast-moving [[helium-4]] ([[Helium-4|{{SimpleNuclide|Helium|4}}]]) nucleus and is [[Stopping power (particle radiation)|stopped]] by a sheet of paper.

Not shown: [[galactic cosmic rays]] that consist of energetic charged nuclei such as [[proton]]s, [[helium]] nuclei, and high-charged nuclei called [[HZE ions]].]]\n[[File:Cloud chambers played an important role of particle detectors.jpg|thumb|[[Cloud chamber]]s are one of few ways of visualizing ionizing radiation. They were employed mainly in [[research]] in the early days of [[particle physics]], but remain an important education tool today.]]\nIonizing radiation is categorized by the nature of the particles or electromagnetic waves that create the ionizing effect. These have different ionization mechanisms, and may be grouped as directly or indirectly ionizing.\n\n===Directly ionizing===\nAny charged particle with mass can ionize [[atom]]s directly by [[fundamental interaction]] through the [[Coulomb force]] if it carries sufficient kinetic energy. This includes [[atomic nuclei]], [[electron]]s, [[muon]]s, charged [[pion]]s, [[proton]]s, and energetic charged nuclei stripped of their electrons. When moving at relativistic speeds these particles have enough kinetic energy to be ionizing, but relativistic speeds are not required. For example, a typical alpha particle is ionizing, but moves at about 5% c, and an electron with 33 eV (enough to ionize) moves at about 1% c.\n\nThe first two ionizing sources to be recognized were given special names used today: Helium nuclei ejected from atomic nuclei are called [[alpha particle]]s, and electrons ejected usually (but not always) at relativistic speeds, are called [[beta particle]]s.\n\nNatural [[cosmic ray]]s are made up primarily of relativistic protons but also include heavier atomic nuclei like [[helium]] ions and [[HZE ions]]. In the atmosphere such particles are often stopped by air molecules, and this produces short-lived charged pions, which soon decay to muons, a primary type of cosmic ray radiation that reaches the ground (and also penetrates it to some extent). Pions can also be produced in large amounts in particle accelerators.\n\n====Alpha particles====\n{{Main article|Alpha particle}}\nAlpha particles consist of two [[proton]]s and two [[neutron]]s bound together into a particle identical to a [[helium]] [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]]. Alpha particle emissions are generally produced in the process of [[alpha decay]], but may also be produced in other ways. Alpha particles are named after the first letter in the [[Greek alphabet]], [[Alpha|\u03b1]]. The symbol for the alpha particle is \u03b1 or \u03b1<sup>2+</sup>. Because they are identical to helium nuclei, they are also sometimes written as {{chem|He|2+}} or {{chem|4|2|He|2+}} indicating a Helium ion with a +2 charge (missing its two electrons). If the ion gains electrons from its environment, the alpha particle can be written as a normal (electrically neutral) helium atom {{chem|4|2|He}}.\n\nAlpha particles are a hugely ionizing form of particle radiation. When they result from radioactive alpha decay they have low penetration depth. In this case they can be [[Stopping power (particle radiation)|absorbed]] by a few centimeters of air, or by the skin. More powerful, long range alpha particles from [[ternary fission]] are three times as energetic, and penetrate proportionately farther in air. The helium nuclei that form 10-12% of cosmic rays, are also usually of much higher energy than those produced by nuclear decay processes, and when encountered in space, are thus able to traverse the human body and dense shielding. However, this type of radiation is significantly attenuated by the Earth's atmosphere, which is a radiation shield equivalent to about 10 meters of water.<ref>[https://engineering.dartmouth.edu/~d76205x/research/Shielding/docs/Parker_06.pdf One kg of water per cm squared is 10 meters of water] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101094421/http://engineering.dartmouth.edu/~d76205x/research/shielding/docs/Parker_06.pdf |date=2016-01-01 }}</ref>\n\n====Beta particles====\n{{Main article|Beta particles}}\nBeta particles are high-energy, high-speed [[electron]]s or [[positron]]s emitted by certain types of [[radioactive]] [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]], such as [[potassium-40]]. The production of beta particles is termed [[beta decay]]. They are designated by the [[Greek alphabet|Greek letter]] beta (\u03b2).\nThere are two forms of beta decay, \u03b2<sup>\u2212</sup> and \u03b2<sup>+</sup>, which respectively give rise to the electron and the positron.<ref>{{cite web|title=Beta Decay|url=http://www.lbl.gov/abc/wallchart/chapters/03/2.html|work=Lbl.gov|date=9 August 2000|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303195332/http://www2.lbl.gov/abc/wallchart/chapters/03/2.html|archivedate=3 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nWhen something is said to have [[radioactive contamination]], it often means that there are beta particles being emitted from its surface, detectable with a [[Geiger counter]] or other radiation detector. When brought into proximity to the beta emitter, the detector will indicate a dramatic increase in radioactivity. When the detector probe is covered with a shield to block the beta rays, the indication will be reduced dramatically.\n\nHigh-energy beta particles may produce X-rays known as [[bremsstrahlung]] (\"braking radiation\") or [[secondary electron]]s ([[delta ray]]) as they pass through matter. Both of these can cause an indirect ionization effect.\n\nBremsstrahlung is of concern when shielding beta emitters, as the interaction of beta particles with the shielding material produces Bremsstrahlung. This effect is greater with material of high atomic numbers, so material with low atomic numbers is used for beta source shielding.\n\n====Positrons and other types of antimatter====\n{{Main article|Positron|Antimatter}}\nThe '''positron''' or '''antielectron''' is the [[antiparticle]] or the [[antimatter]] counterpart of the [[electron]]. When a low-energy positron collides with a low-energy electron, [[annihilation]] occurs, resulting in their conversion into the energy of two or more [[gamma ray]] [[photon]]s (see [[electron\u2013positron annihilation]]).\n\nPositrons can be generated by [[positron emission]] nuclear decay (through [[weak interaction]]s), or by [[pair production]] from a sufficiently energetic [[photon]]. Positrons are common artificial sources of ionizing radiation used in medical [[PET scan|positron emission tomography]] (PET) scans.\n\nAs positrons are positively charged particles they can also directly ionize an atom through Coulomb interactions.\n\n====Charged nuclei====\nCharged nuclei are characteristic of galactic cosmic rays and solar particle events and except for alpha particles (charged helium nuclei) have no natural sources on the earth. In space, however, very high energy protons, helium nuclei, and HZE ions can be initially stopped by relatively thin layers of shielding, clothes, or skin. However, the resulting interaction will generate secondary radiation and cause cascading biological effects. If just one atom of tissue is displaced by an energetic proton, for example, the collision will cause further interactions in the body. This is called \"[[linear energy transfer]]\" (LET), which utilizes [[elastic scattering]].\n\nLET can be visualized as a billiard ball hitting another in the manner of the [[conservation of momentum]], sending both away with the energy of the first ball divided between the two unequally. When a charged nucleus strikes a relatively slow-moving nucleus of an object in space, LET occurs and neutrons, alpha particles, low-energy protons, and other nuclei will be released by the collisions and contribute to the total absorbed dose of tissue.<ref name=\"NASA/TP-1999-209320\">[[hdl:2060/19990051001|Contribution of High Charge and Energy (HZE) Ions During Solar-Particle Event of September 29, 1989]] Kim, Myung-Hee Y.; Wilson, John W.; Cucinotta, Francis A.; Simonsen, Lisa C.; Atwell, William; Badavi, Francis F.; Miller, Jack, NASA Johnson Space Center; Langley Research Center, May 1999.</ref>\n\n=== Indirectly ionizing ===\nIndirect ionizing radiation is electrically neutral and therefore does not interact strongly with matter.

Either of those interactions will cause the ejection of an electron from an atom at relativistic speeds, turning that electron into a beta particle (secondary beta particle) that will ionize many other atoms. Since most of the affected atoms are ionized directly by the [[secondary beta]] particles, photons are called indirectly ionizing radiation.<ref>{{cite web|last=European Centre of Technological Safety|title=Interaction of Radiation with Matter|url=http://www.tesec-int.org/TechHaz-site%2008/Radiation-interaction.pdf|work=Radiation Hazard|accessdate=5 November 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512170010/http://www.tesec-int.org/TechHaz-site%2008/Radiation-interaction.pdf|archivedate=12 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nPhoton radiation is called [[gamma ray]]s if produced by a [[nuclear reaction]], [[subatomic particle]] decay, or [[radioactive decay]] within the nucleus.

Modern technologies and discoveries have resulted in an overlap between X-ray and gamma energies. In many fields they are functionally identical, differing for terrestrial studies only in origin of the radiation. In astronomy, however, where radiation origin often cannot be reliably determined, the old energy division has been preserved, with X-rays defined as being between about 120 eV and 120 keV, and gamma rays as being of any energy above 100 to 120 keV, regardless of source. Most astronomical \"[[gamma-rays|gamma-ray astronomy]]\" are known ''not'' to originate in nuclear radioactive processes but, rather, result from processes like those that produce astronomical X-rays, except driven by much more energetic electrons.\n\nPhotoelectric absorption is the dominant mechanism in organic materials for photon energies below 100 keV, typical of classical X-ray tube originated [[X-ray]]s. At energies beyond 100 keV, photons ionize matter increasingly through the [[Compton effect]], and then indirectly through [[pair production]] at energies beyond 5 MeV. The accompanying interaction diagram shows two Compton scatterings happening sequentially. In every scattering event, the gamma ray transfers energy to an electron, and it continues on its path in a different direction and with reduced energy.\n\n====Definition boundary for lower-energy photons====\n{{see also|Ultraviolet}}\nThe lowest ionization energy of any element is 3.89 eV, for [[caesium]].

Thus, X-ray radiation is always ionizing, but only extreme-ultraviolet radiation can be considered ionizing under all definitions.\n\nThe biological effect of ionizing radiation on cells somewhat resembles that of a broader spectrum of '''molecularly damaging''' radiation, which overlaps ionizing radiation and extends beyond, to somewhat lower energies into all regions of UV and sometimes visible light in some systems (such as photosynthetic systems in leaves). Although [[DNA]] is always susceptible to damage by ionizing radiation, the DNA molecule may also be damaged by radiation with enough energy to excite certain [[molecular bond]]s to form [[pyrimidine dimer]]s. This energy may be less than ionizing, but near to it. A good example is ultraviolet spectrum energy which begins at about 3.1 eV (400&nbsp;nm) at close to the same energy level which can cause [[sunburn]] to unprotected skin, as a result of [[photochemistry|photoreactions]] in [[collagen]] and (in the [[UV-B]] range) also damage in DNA (for example, [[pyrimidine dimers]]). Thus, the mid and lower ultraviolet electromagnetic spectrum is damaging to biological tissues as a result of electronic excitation in molecules which falls short of ionization, but produces similar non-thermal effects. To some extent, visible light and also ultraviolet A (UVA) which is closest to visible energies, have been proven to result in formation of [[reactive oxygen species]] in skin, which cause indirect damage since these are electronically excited molecules which can inflict reactive damage, although they do not cause sunburn (erythema).<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors = Liebel F, Kaur S, Ruvolo E, Kollias N, Southall MD |title=Irradiation of skin with visible light induces reactive oxygen species and matrix-degrading enzymes |journal=J.

The small circles show where ionization occurs.]]\n\n====Neutrons====\n{{main article|Neutron|neutron radiation}}\n[[Neutron]]s have zero electrical charge and thus often do not ''directly'' cause ionization in a single step or interaction with matter. However, fast neutrons will interact with the protons in hydrogen via [[linear energy transfer|LET]], and this mechanism scatters the nuclei of the materials in the target area, causing direct ionization of the hydrogen atoms. When neutrons strike the hydrogen nuclei, proton radiation (fast protons) results. These protons are themselves ionizing because they are of high energy, are charged, and interact with the electrons in matter.\n\nNeutrons that strike other nuclei besides hydrogen will transfer less energy to the other particle if LET does occur. But, for many nuclei struck by neutrons, [[inelastic scattering]] occurs. Whether elastic or inelastic scatter occurs is dependent on the speed of the neutron, whether [[Neutron temperature|fast]] or [[Neutron temperature|thermal]] or somewhere in between. It is also dependent on the nuclei it strikes and its [[neutron cross section]].\n\nIn inelastic scattering, neutrons are readily absorbed in a type of [[nuclear reaction]] called [[neutron capture]] and attributes to the [[neutron activation]] of the nucleus. Neutron interactions with most types of matter in this manner usually produce [[radioactive]] nuclei. The abundant [[isotopes of oxygen|oxygen-16]] nucleus, for example, undergoes neutron activation, rapidly decays by a proton emission forming [[isotopes of nitrogen|nitrogen-16]], which decays to oxygen-16. The short-lived nitrogen-16 decay emits a powerful beta ray. This process can be written as:\n\n<blockquote><sub>16</sub>O (n,p) <sub>16</sub>N (fast neutron capture possible with >11 MeV neutron)\n<sub>16</sub>N \u2192 <sub>16</sub>O + \u03b2<sup>\u2212</sup> (Decay t<sub>1/2</sub> = 7.13 s)\nThis high-energy \u03b2<sup>\u2212</sup> further interacts rapidly with other nuclei, emitting high-energy \u03b3 via [[Bremsstrahlung]]</blockquote>\n\nWhile not a favorable reaction, the <sub>16</sub>O (n,p) <sub>16</sub>N reaction is a major source of X-rays emitted from the cooling water of a [[pressurized water reactor]] and contributes enormously to the radiation generated by a water-cooled [[nuclear reactor]] while operating.\n\nFor the best shielding of neutrons, hydrocarbons that have an abundance of [[hydrogen]] are used.\n\nIn [[fissile]] materials, secondary neutrons may produce [[nuclear chain reaction]]s, causing a larger amount of ionization from the [[daughter product]]s of fission.\n\nOutside the nucleus, free neutrons are unstable and have a mean lifetime of 14 minutes, 42 seconds. Free neutrons decay by emission of an electron and an electron antineutrino to become a proton, a process known as [[beta decay]]:<ref>{{cite journal |author=W.-M.

At the end of its path, the neutron is captured by a nucleus in an (n,\u03b3)-reaction that leads to the emission of a [[neutron capture]] photon. Such photons always have enough energy to qualify as ionizing radiation.\n\n==Physical effects==\n{{main article|Radiation damage}}\n[[File:Cyclotron with glowing beam.jpg|thumb|right|Ionized air glows blue around a beam of particulate ionizing radiation from a [[cyclotron]]]]\n\n===Nuclear effects===\nNeutron radiation, alpha radiation, and extremely energetic gamma (> ~20 MeV) can cause [[nuclear transmutation]] and [[induced radioactivity]]. The relevant mechanisms are [[neutron activation]], [[alpha absorption]], and [[photodisintegration]]. A large enough number of transmutations can change macroscopic properties and cause targets to become radioactive themselves, even after the original source is removed.\n\n===Chemical effects===\n{{main article|Radiation chemistry}}\nIonization of molecules can lead to [[radiolysis]] (breaking chemical bonds), and formation of highly reactive [[free radicals]]. These free radicals may then react chemically with neighbouring materials even after the original radiation has stopped. (e.g., [[ozone cracking]] of polymers by ozone formed by ionization of air). Ionizing radiation can also accelerate existing chemical reactions such as polymerization and corrosion, by contributing to the activation energy required for the reaction. Optical materials deteriorate under the effect of ionizing radiation.\n\nHigh-intensity ionizing radiation in air can produce a visible [[ionized air glow]] of telltale bluish-purple color. The glow can be observed, e.g., during [[criticality accident]]s, around [[mushroom cloud]]s shortly after a [[nuclear explosion]], or the inside of a damaged nuclear reactor like during the [[Chernobyl disaster]].\n\nMonatomic fluids, e.g. molten [[sodium]], have no chemical bonds to break and no crystal lattice to disturb, so they are immune to the chemical effects of ionizing radiation. Simple diatomic compounds with very negative [[enthalpy of formation]], such as [[hydrogen fluoride]] will reform rapidly and spontaneously after ionization.\n\n===Electrical effects===\nIonization of materials temporarily increases their conductivity, potentially permitting damaging current levels. This is a particular hazard in [[semiconductor]] microelectronics employed in electronic equipment, with subsequent currents introducing operation errors or even permanently damaging the devices. Devices intended for high radiation environments such as the nuclear industry and extra-atmospheric (space) applications may be made [[radiation hardening|''radiation hard'']] to resist such effects through design, material selection, and fabrication methods.\n\nProton radiation found in space can also cause [[single-event upset]]s in digital circuits.\n6\nThe electrical effects of ionizing radiation are exploited in gas-filled radiation detectors, e.g. the [[Geiger-Muller counter]] or the [[ion chamber]].\n\n==Health effects==\n{{main article|Radiobiology}}\nIn general, ionizing radiation is harmful and potentially lethal to living beings but some types have medical applications in [[radiation therapy]] for the treatment of cancer and [[thyrotoxicosis]].\n\nMost adverse health effects of exposure to ionizing radiation may be grouped in two general categories:\n*deterministic effects (harmful tissue reactions) due in large part to killing or malfunction of cells following high doses from [[radiation burn]]s.\n*stochastic effects, i.e., [[Radiation-induced cancer|cancer]] and heritable effects involving either cancer development in exposed individuals owing to [[mutation]] of somatic cells or heritable disease in their offspring owing to mutation of reproductive (germ) cells.{{sfn | ICRP | 2007 | loc= paragraph 55}}\n\nThe most common impact is stochastic [[radiation-induced cancer|induction of cancer]] with a latent period of years or decades after exposure.

For example, at one time, assistants in shoe shops [[Shoe-fitting fluoroscope|used X-rays to check a child's shoe size]], but this practice was halted when the risks of ionizing radiation were better understood.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Shoe-fitting Fluoroscope as a Radiation Hazard |journal=California Medicine |first=Leon |last=Lewis |first2=Paul E |last2=Caplan |volume=72 |issue=1 |pmid=15408494 |date=January 1, 1950 |pmc=1520288 |pages=26\u201330 [27]}}</ref>\n\nNeutron radiation is essential to the working of [[nuclear reactor]]s and [[nuclear weapon]]s. The penetrating power of x-ray, gamma, beta, and positron radiation is used for [[medical imaging]], [[nondestructive testing]], and a variety of industrial gauges. [[Radioactive tracers]] are used in medical and industrial applications, as well as biological and [[radiation chemistry]]. Alpha radiation is used in [[static eliminator]]s and [[smoke detectors]]. The sterilizing effects of ionizing radiation are useful for cleaning medical instruments, [[food irradiation]], and the [[sterile insect technique]]. Measurements of [[carbon-14]], can be used to [[radiocarbon dating|date]] the remains of long-dead organisms (such as wood that is thousands of years old).\n\n==Sources of radiation==\nIonizing radiation is generated through nuclear reactions, nuclear decay, by very high temperature, or via acceleration of charged particles in electromagnetic fields.

The remaining 20% results from exposure to man-made radiation sources, primarily from [[medical imaging]]. Average man-made exposure is much higher in developed countries, mostly due to [[CT scans]] and [[nuclear medicine]].\n\nNatural [[background radiation]] comes from five primary sources: cosmic radiation, solar radiation, external terrestrial sources, radiation in the human body, and [[radon]].\n\nThe background rate for natural radiation varies considerably with location, being as low as 1.5&nbsp;mSv/a (1.5&nbsp;mSv per year) in some areas and over 100&nbsp;mSv/a in others. The highest level of purely natural radiation recorded on the Earth's surface is 90&nbsp;\u00b5Gy/h (0.8&nbsp;Gy/a) on a Brazilian black beach composed of [[monazite]].<ref>{{cite book|last=[[United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation]]|title=Sources and Effects of Ionizing Radiation|year=2000|publisher=United Nations|chapter-url=http://www.unscear.org/unscear/publications/2000_1.html|accessdate=11 November 2012|page=121|volume=vol. 1|chapter=Annex B|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804174956/http://www.unscear.org/unscear/publications/2000_1.html|archivedate=4 August 2012}}</ref> The highest background radiation in an inhabited area is found in [[Ramsar, Mazandaran|Ramsar]], primarily due to naturally radioactive limestone used as a building material.

Despite the high levels of background radiation that the residents of Ramsar receive there is no compelling evidence that they experience a greater health risk. The ICRP recommendations are conservative limits and may represent an over representation of the actual health risk. Generally radiation safety organization recommend the most conservative limits assuming it is best to err on the side of caution. This level of caution is appropriate but should not be used to create fear about background radiation danger. Radiation danger from background radiation may be a serious threat but is more likely a small overall risk compared to all other factors in the environment.\n\n====Cosmic radiation====\n{{see also|Cosmic ray}}\nThe Earth, and all living things on it, are constantly bombarded by radiation from outside our solar system. This cosmic radiation consists of relativistic particles: positively charged nuclei (ions) from 1 [[Atomic mass unit|amu]] [[proton]]s (about 85% of it) to 26 amu [[iron]] [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] and even beyond. (The high-atomic number particles are called [[HZE ions]].) The energy of this radiation can far exceed that which humans can create, even in the largest [[particle accelerator]]s (see [[ultra-high-energy cosmic ray]]). This radiation interacts in the atmosphere to create secondary radiation that rains down, including [[x-rays]], [[muon]]s, [[proton]]s, [[antiproton]]s, [[alpha particle]]s, [[pion]]s, [[electron]]s, [[positron]]s, and [[neutron]]s.\n\nThe [[Dose (biochemistry)|dose]] from cosmic radiation is largely from muons, neutrons, and electrons, with a dose rate that varies in different parts of the world and based largely on the geomagnetic field, altitude, and solar cycle. The cosmic-radiation dose rate on airplanes is so high that, according to the United Nations UNSCEAR 2000 Report (see links at bottom), airline flight crew workers receive more dose on average than any other worker, including those in nuclear power plants. Airline crews receive more cosmic rays if they routinely work flight routes that take them close to the North or South pole at high altitudes, where this type of radiation is maximal.\n\nCosmic rays also include high-energy gamma rays, which are far beyond the energies produced by solar or human sources.\n\n====External terrestrial sources====\nMost materials on Earth contain some radioactive [[atom]]s, even if in small quantities. Most of the dose received from these sources is from gamma-ray emitters in building materials, or rocks and soil when outside. The major [[radionuclide]]s of concern for '''terrestrial radiation''' are isotopes of [[potassium]], [[uranium]], and [[thorium]]. Each of these sources has been decreasing in activity since the formation of the Earth.\n\n====Internal radiation sources====\n{{see also|Committed dose}}\nAll earthly materials that are the building-blocks of life contain a radioactive component. As humans, plants, and animals consume food, air, and water, an inventory of radioisotopes builds up within the organism (see [[banana equivalent dose]]). Some radionuclides, like [[potassium-40]], emit a high-energy gamma ray that can be measured by sensitive electronic radiation measurement systems. These internal radiation sources contribute to an individual's total radiation dose from [[natural background radiation]].\n\n====Radon====\n{{see also|Health effects of radon}}\nAn important source of natural radiation is [[radon]] gas, which seeps continuously from bedrock but can, because of its high density, accumulate in poorly ventilated houses.\n\n[[Radon-222]] is a gas produced by the decay of [[radium]]-226. Both are a part of the natural [[uranium]] decay chain. Uranium is found in soil throughout the world in varying concentrations. Among non-smokers, radon is the largest cause of lung cancer and, overall, the second-leading cause.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/radon/healthrisks.html |title=Health Risks |website=Radon |publisher=EPA |accessdate=2012-03-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020231845/http://www.epa.gov/radon/healthrisks.html |archivedate=2008-10-20}}</ref>\n\n==Radiation exposure==\n[[File:Exposure chart-XKCD.svg|thumb|Various doses of radiation in sieverts, ranging from trivial to lethal.]]\n{{main article|Radiation protection}}\nThere are three standard ways to limit exposure:\n# '''Time''': For people exposed to radiation in addition to natural background radiation, limiting or minimizing the exposure time will reduce the dose from the radiation source.\n# '''Distance''': Radiation intensity decreases sharply with distance, according to an [[inverse-square law]] (in an absolute vacuum).<ref name=Camphausen>Camphausen KA, Lawrence RC.

Barriers of [[lead]], [[concrete]], or water are often used to give effective protection from more penetrating particles such as gamma rays and [[neutrons]]. Some radioactive materials are stored or handled underwater or by [[remote control]] in rooms constructed of thick concrete or lined with lead. There are special [[plastic]] shields that stop beta particles, and air will stop most alpha particles. The effectiveness of a material in shielding radiation is determined by its [[half-value layer|half-value thicknesses]], the thickness of material that reduces the radiation by half. This value is a function of the material itself and of the type and energy of ionizing radiation. Some generally accepted thicknesses of attenuating material are 5&nbsp;mm of aluminum for most beta particles, and 3&nbsp;inches of lead for gamma radiation.\n\nThese can all be applied to natural and man-made sources. For man-made sources the use of '''Containment''' is a major tool in reducing dose uptake and is effectively a combination of shielding and isolation from the open environment. Radioactive materials are confined in the smallest possible space and kept out of the environment such as in a [[hot cell]] (for radiation) or [[glove box]] (for contamination). [[Radioactive isotope]]s for medical use, for example, are dispensed in closed handling facilities, usually gloveboxes, while [[nuclear reactor]]s operate within closed systems with multiple barriers that keep the radioactive materials contained. Work rooms, hot cells and gloveboxes have slightly reduced air pressures to prevent escape of airborne material to the open environment.\n\nIn nuclear conflicts or civil nuclear releases [[civil defense]] measures can help reduce exposure of populations by reducing ingestion of isotopes and occupational exposure. One is the issue of [[potassium iodide]] (KI) tablets, which blocks the uptake of [[iodine-131|radioactive iodine]] (one of the major radioisotope products of [[nuclear fission]]) into the human [[thyroid]] gland.\n\n===Occupational exposure===\nOccupationally exposed individuals are controlled within the regulatory framework of the country they work in, and in accordance with any local nuclear licence constraints. These are usually based on the recommendations of the ICRP.\nThe International Commission on Radiological Protection recommends limiting artificial irradiation. For occupational exposure, the limit is 50 mSv in a single year with a maximum of 100 mSv in a consecutive five-year period.{{sfn | ICRP | 2007 }}\n\nThe radiation exposure of these individuals is carefully monitored with the use of [[dosimeter]]s and other radiological protection instruments which will measure radioactive particulate concentrations, area gamma dose readings and [[radioactive contamination]]. A legal record of dose is kept.\n\nExamples of activities where occupational exposure is a concern include:\n*Airline crew (the most exposed population)\n*[[Industrial radiography]]\n*Medical [[radiology]] and [[nuclear medicine]]<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1088/0952-4746/16/4/004|vauthors = Pattison JE, Bachmann DJ, Beddoe AH|title=Gamma Dosimetry at Surfaces of Cylindrical Containers|journal=Journal of Radiological Protection|volume= 16|issue=4|pages=249\u2013261|year=1996|bibcode = 1996JRP....16..249P }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1097/00004032-199911000-00006|author=Pattison, J.E.|title= Finger Doses Received during Samarium-153 Injections|journal=Health Physics|volume=77|issue=5|pages=530\u20135|year=1999|pmid=10524506}}</ref>\n*Uranium mining\n*[[Nuclear power plant]] and [[nuclear fuel reprocessing plant]] workers\n*Research laboratories (government, university and private)\n\nSome human-made radiation sources affect the body through direct radiation, known as [[effective dose (radiation)]] while others take the form of [[radioactive contamination]] and [[irradiate]] the body from within. The latter is known as [[committed dose]].\n\n===Public exposure===\nMedical procedures, such as diagnostic [[X-ray]]s, [[nuclear medicine]], and [[radiation therapy]] are by far the most significant source of human-made radiation exposure to the general public. Some of the major [[radionuclide]]s used are [[I-131]], [[Tc-99m]], [[Co-60]], [[iridium|Ir-192]], and [[caesium|Cs-137]]. The public also is exposed to radiation from consumer products, such as [[tobacco]] ([[polonium]]-210), combustible fuels (gas, [[coal]], etc.), [[television]]s, luminous [[watch]]es and dials ([[tritium]]), airport [[X-ray]] systems, [[smoke detector]]s ([[americium]]), electron tubes, and gas lantern mantles ([[thorium]]).\n\nOf lesser magnitude, members of the public are exposed to radiation from the [[nuclear fuel]] cycle, which includes the entire sequence from processing [[uranium]] to the disposal of the spent fuel. The effects of such exposure have not been reliably measured due to the extremely low doses involved. Opponents use a cancer per dose model to assert that such activities cause several hundred cases of cancer per year, an application of the widely accepted [[Linear no-threshold model]] (LNT).\n\nThe International Commission on Radiological Protection recommends limiting artificial irradiation to the public to an average of 1&nbsp;mSv (0.001&nbsp;Sv) of effective dose per year, not including medical and occupational exposures.{{sfn | ICRP | 2007 }}\n\nIn a [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]], gamma rays from both the initial weapon explosion and [[Nuclear fallout|fallout]] would be the sources of radiation exposure.\n\n====Spaceflight====\nMassive particles are a concern for astronauts outside the [[earth's magnetic field]] who would receive solar particles from [[solar proton event]]s (SPE) and [[galactic cosmic rays]] from cosmic sources. These high-energy charged nuclei are blocked by Earth's magnetic field but pose a [[Health threat from cosmic rays|major health concern]] for astronauts traveling to the moon and to any distant location beyond the earth orbit. Highly charged HZE ions in particular are known to be extremely damaging, although protons make up the vast majority of galactic cosmic rays. Evidence indicates past SPE radiation levels that would have been lethal for unprotected astronauts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7142|title=Superflares could kill unprotected astronauts|publisher=New Scientist|date=21 March 2005|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150327023245/http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7142|archivedate=27 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Air travel====\nAir travel exposes people on aircraft to increased radiation from space as compared to sea level, including [[cosmic rays]] and from [[solar flare]] events.<ref>{{cite web |title=Effective Dose Rate |url=http://sol.spacenvironment.net/raps_ops/current_files/globeView.html |website=NAIRAS (Nowcast of Atmospheric Ionizing Radiation System) |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305061814/http://sol.spacenvironment.net/raps_ops/current_files/globeView.html |archive-date=2016-03-05 }}</ref><ref name=davis>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_6hymYAgC6MC&pg=PA229#v=onepage&f=false |author1=Jeffrey R.

Almost all products of radioactive decay are ionizing because the energy of radioactive decay is typically far higher than that required to ionize. Other subatomic ionizing particles which occur naturally are [[muon]]s, [[meson]]s, [[positron]]s, and other particles that constitute the secondary [[cosmic particle]]s that are produced after primary [[cosmic rays]] interact with Earth's atmosphere.<ref name=\"Woodside\">{{cite book\n |last        = Woodside\n |first       = Gayle\n |title       = Environmental, Safety, and Health Engineering\n |publisher   = John Wiley & Sons\n |year        = 1997\n |location    = US\n |pages       = 476\n |url         = https://books.google.com/books?id=SJP57-0UOzYC&pg=PA476&dq=%22ionizing+radiation\n |isbn        = 978-0471109327\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20151019172351/https://books.google.com/books?id=SJP57-0UOzYC&pg=PA476&dq=%22ionizing+radiation\n |archivedate = 2015-10-19\n}}</ref><ref name=\"Stallcup\">{{cite book\n |last        = Stallcup\n |first       = James G.\n |title       = OSHA: Stallcup's High-voltage Telecommunications Regulations Simplified\n |publisher   = Jones & Bartlett Learning\n |year        = 2006\n |location    = US\n |pages       = 133\n |url         = https://books.google.com/books?id=CpyeNUgls68C&pg=SA13-PA3&dq=%22ionizing+radiation\n |isbn        = 978-0763743475\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20151017165816/https://books.google.com/books?id=CpyeNUgls68C&pg=SA13-PA3&dq=%22ionizing+radiation\n |archivedate = 2015-10-17\n}}</ref> Cosmic rays are generated by stars and certain celestial events such as [[supernova]] explosions. [[Cosmic rays]] may also produce [[radioisotope]]s on Earth (for example, [[carbon-14]]), which in turn decay and produce ionizing radiation. Cosmic rays and the decay of [[radioactive]] [[isotopes]] are the primary sources of natural ionizing radiation on Earth referred to as [[background radiation]]. Ionizing radiation can also be generated artificially by [[X-ray tube]]s, [[particle accelerators]], and any of the various methods that produce radioisotopes artificially.\n\nIonizing radiation is not detectable by human senses, so radiation detection instruments such as [[Geiger counter]]s must be used to indicate its presence and measure it. However, high intensities can cause emission of visible light upon interaction with matter, such as in [[Cherenkov radiation]] and [[radioluminescence]]. Ionizing radiation is used in a wide variety of fields such as [[medicine]], [[nuclear power]], research, manufacturing, construction, and many other areas, but presents a health hazard if proper measures against undesired exposure are not followed. Exposure to ionizing radiation causes damage to living [[tissue (anatomy)|tissue]], and can result in [[radiation burn]]s, [[cell damage]], [[radiation sickness]], [[Radiation-induced cancer|cancer]], and [[death]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ryan|first=Julie|date=5 January 2012|title=Ionizing Radiation: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly|journal= The Journal of Investigative Dermatology|volume=132|issue=3 0 2|pages=985\u2013993|pmc=3779131|pmid=22217743|doi=10.1038/jid.2011.411}}</ref>\n\n==Types==\n{{main article|Particle radiation}}\n[[File:Alfa beta gamma neutron radiation.svg|thumb|Alpha ('''\u03b1''') radiation consists of a fast-moving [[helium-4]] ([[Helium-4|{{SimpleNuclide|Helium|4}}]]) nucleus and is [[Stopping power (particle radiation)|stopped]] by a sheet of paper.

Not shown: [[galactic cosmic rays]] that consist of energetic charged nuclei such as [[proton]]s, [[helium]] nuclei, and high-charged nuclei called [[HZE ions]].]]\n[[File:Cloud chambers played an important role of particle detectors.jpg|thumb|[[Cloud chamber]]s are one of few ways of visualizing ionizing radiation. They were employed mainly in [[research]] in the early days of [[particle physics]], but remain an important education tool today.]]\nIonizing radiation is categorized by the nature of the particles or electromagnetic waves that create the ionizing effect. These have different ionization mechanisms, and may be grouped as directly or indirectly ionizing.\n\n===Directly ionizing===\nAny charged particle with mass can ionize [[atom]]s directly by [[fundamental interaction]] through the [[Coulomb force]] if it carries sufficient kinetic energy. This includes [[atomic nuclei]], [[electron]]s, [[muon]]s, charged [[pion]]s, [[proton]]s, and energetic charged nuclei stripped of their electrons. When moving at relativistic speeds these particles have enough kinetic energy to be ionizing, but relativistic speeds are not required. For example, a typical alpha particle is ionizing, but moves at about 5% c, and an electron with 33 eV (enough to ionize) moves at about 1% c.\n\nThe first two ionizing sources to be recognized were given special names used today: Helium nuclei ejected from atomic nuclei are called [[alpha particle]]s, and electrons ejected usually (but not always) at relativistic speeds, are called [[beta particle]]s.\n\nNatural [[cosmic ray]]s are made up primarily of relativistic protons but also include heavier atomic nuclei like [[helium]] ions and [[HZE ions]]. In the atmosphere such particles are often stopped by air molecules, and this produces short-lived charged pions, which soon decay to muons, a primary type of cosmic ray radiation that reaches the ground (and also penetrates it to some extent). Pions can also be produced in large amounts in particle accelerators.\n\n====Alpha particles====\n{{Main article|Alpha particle}}\nAlpha particles consist of two [[proton]]s and two [[neutron]]s bound together into a particle identical to a [[helium]] [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]]. Alpha particle emissions are generally produced in the process of [[alpha decay]], but may also be produced in other ways. Alpha particles are named after the first letter in the [[Greek alphabet]], [[Alpha|\u03b1]]. The symbol for the alpha particle is \u03b1 or \u03b1<sup>2+</sup>. Because they are identical to helium nuclei, they are also sometimes written as {{chem|He|2+}} or {{chem|4|2|He|2+}} indicating a Helium ion with a +2 charge (missing its two electrons). If the ion gains electrons from its environment, the alpha particle can be written as a normal (electrically neutral) helium atom {{chem|4|2|He}}.\n\nAlpha particles are a hugely ionizing form of particle radiation. When they result from radioactive alpha decay they have low penetration depth. In this case they can be [[Stopping power (particle radiation)|absorbed]] by a few centimeters of air, or by the skin. More powerful, long range alpha particles from [[ternary fission]] are three times as energetic, and penetrate proportionately farther in air. The helium nuclei that form 10-12% of cosmic rays, are also usually of much higher energy than those produced by nuclear decay processes, and when encountered in space, are thus able to traverse the human body and dense shielding. However, this type of radiation is significantly attenuated by the Earth's atmosphere, which is a radiation shield equivalent to about 10 meters of water.<ref>[https://engineering.dartmouth.edu/~d76205x/research/Shielding/docs/Parker_06.pdf One kg of water per cm squared is 10 meters of water] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101094421/http://engineering.dartmouth.edu/~d76205x/research/shielding/docs/Parker_06.pdf |date=2016-01-01 }}</ref>\n\n====Beta particles====\n{{Main article|Beta particles}}\nBeta particles are high-energy, high-speed [[electron]]s or [[positron]]s emitted by certain types of [[radioactive]] [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]], such as [[potassium-40]]. The production of beta particles is termed [[beta decay]]. They are designated by the [[Greek alphabet|Greek letter]] beta (\u03b2).\nThere are two forms of beta decay, \u03b2<sup>\u2212</sup> and \u03b2<sup>+</sup>, which respectively give rise to the electron and the positron.<ref>{{cite web|title=Beta Decay|url=http://www.lbl.gov/abc/wallchart/chapters/03/2.html|work=Lbl.gov|date=9 August 2000|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303195332/http://www2.lbl.gov/abc/wallchart/chapters/03/2.html|archivedate=3 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nWhen something is said to have [[radioactive contamination]], it often means that there are beta particles being emitted from its surface, detectable with a [[Geiger counter]] or other radiation detector. When brought into proximity to the beta emitter, the detector will indicate a dramatic increase in radioactivity. When the detector probe is covered with a shield to block the beta rays, the indication will be reduced dramatically.\n\nHigh-energy beta particles may produce X-rays known as [[bremsstrahlung]] (\"braking radiation\") or [[secondary electron]]s ([[delta ray]]) as they pass through matter. Both of these can cause an indirect ionization effect.\n\nBremsstrahlung is of concern when shielding beta emitters, as the interaction of beta particles with the shielding material produces Bremsstrahlung. This effect is greater with material of high atomic numbers, so material with low atomic numbers is used for beta source shielding.\n\n====Positrons and other types of antimatter====\n{{Main article|Positron|Antimatter}}\nThe '''positron''' or '''antielectron''' is the [[antiparticle]] or the [[antimatter]] counterpart of the [[electron]]. When a low-energy positron collides with a low-energy electron, [[annihilation]] occurs, resulting in their conversion into the energy of two or more [[gamma ray]] [[photon]]s (see [[electron\u2013positron annihilation]]).\n\nPositrons can be generated by [[positron emission]] nuclear decay (through [[weak interaction]]s), or by [[pair production]] from a sufficiently energetic [[photon]]. Positrons are common artificial sources of ionizing radiation used in medical [[PET scan|positron emission tomography]] (PET) scans.\n\nAs positrons are positively charged particles they can also directly ionize an atom through Coulomb interactions.\n\n====Charged nuclei====\nCharged nuclei are characteristic of galactic cosmic rays and solar particle events and except for alpha particles (charged helium nuclei) have no natural sources on the earth. In space, however, very high energy protons, helium nuclei, and HZE ions can be initially stopped by relatively thin layers of shielding, clothes, or skin. However, the resulting interaction will generate secondary radiation and cause cascading biological effects. If just one atom of tissue is displaced by an energetic proton, for example, the collision will cause further interactions in the body. This is called \"[[linear energy transfer]]\" (LET), which utilizes [[elastic scattering]].\n\nLET can be visualized as a billiard ball hitting another in the manner of the [[conservation of momentum]], sending both away with the energy of the first ball divided between the two unequally. When a charged nucleus strikes a relatively slow-moving nucleus of an object in space, LET occurs and neutrons, alpha particles, low-energy protons, and other nuclei will be released by the collisions and contribute to the total absorbed dose of tissue.<ref name=\"NASA/TP-1999-209320\">[[hdl:2060/19990051001|Contribution of High Charge and Energy (HZE) Ions During Solar-Particle Event of September 29, 1989]] Kim, Myung-Hee Y.; Wilson, John W.; Cucinotta, Francis A.; Simonsen, Lisa C.; Atwell, William; Badavi, Francis F.; Miller, Jack, NASA Johnson Space Center; Langley Research Center, May 1999.</ref>\n\n=== Indirectly ionizing ===\nIndirect ionizing radiation is electrically neutral and therefore does not interact strongly with matter.

Either of those interactions will cause the ejection of an electron from an atom at relativistic speeds, turning that electron into a beta particle (secondary beta particle) that will ionize many other atoms. Since most of the affected atoms are ionized directly by the [[secondary beta]] particles, photons are called indirectly ionizing radiation.<ref>{{cite web|last=European Centre of Technological Safety|title=Interaction of Radiation with Matter|url=http://www.tesec-int.org/TechHaz-site%2008/Radiation-interaction.pdf|work=Radiation Hazard|accessdate=5 November 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512170010/http://www.tesec-int.org/TechHaz-site%2008/Radiation-interaction.pdf|archivedate=12 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nPhoton radiation is called [[gamma ray]]s if produced by a [[nuclear reaction]], [[subatomic particle]] decay, or [[radioactive decay]] within the nucleus.

Modern technologies and discoveries have resulted in an overlap between X-ray and gamma energies. In many fields they are functionally identical, differing for terrestrial studies only in origin of the radiation. In astronomy, however, where radiation origin often cannot be reliably determined, the old energy division has been preserved, with X-rays defined as being between about 120 eV and 120 keV, and gamma rays as being of any energy above 100 to 120 keV, regardless of source. Most astronomical \"[[gamma-rays|gamma-ray astronomy]]\" are known ''not'' to originate in nuclear radioactive processes but, rather, result from processes like those that produce astronomical X-rays, except driven by much more energetic electrons.\n\nPhotoelectric absorption is the dominant mechanism in organic materials for photon energies below 100 keV, typical of classical X-ray tube originated [[X-ray]]s. At energies beyond 100 keV, photons ionize matter increasingly through the [[Compton effect]], and then indirectly through [[pair production]] at energies beyond 5 MeV. The accompanying interaction diagram shows two Compton scatterings happening sequentially. In every scattering event, the gamma ray transfers energy to an electron, and it continues on its path in a different direction and with reduced energy.\n\n====Definition boundary for lower-energy photons====\n{{see also|Ultraviolet}}\nThe lowest ionization energy of any element is 3.89 eV, for [[caesium]].

Thus, X-ray radiation is always ionizing, but only extreme-ultraviolet radiation can be considered ionizing under all definitions.\n\nThe biological effect of ionizing radiation on cells somewhat resembles that of a broader spectrum of '''molecularly damaging''' radiation, which overlaps ionizing radiation and extends beyond, to somewhat lower energies into all regions of UV and sometimes visible light in some systems (such as photosynthetic systems in leaves). Although [[DNA]] is always susceptible to damage by ionizing radiation, the DNA molecule may also be damaged by radiation with enough energy to excite certain [[molecular bond]]s to form [[pyrimidine dimer]]s. This energy may be less than ionizing, but near to it. A good example is ultraviolet spectrum energy which begins at about 3.1 eV (400&nbsp;nm) at close to the same energy level which can cause [[sunburn]] to unprotected skin, as a result of [[photochemistry|photoreactions]] in [[collagen]] and (in the [[UV-B]] range) also damage in DNA (for example, [[pyrimidine dimers]]). Thus, the mid and lower ultraviolet electromagnetic spectrum is damaging to biological tissues as a result of electronic excitation in molecules which falls short of ionization, but produces similar non-thermal effects. To some extent, visible light and also ultraviolet A (UVA) which is closest to visible energies, have been proven to result in formation of [[reactive oxygen species]] in skin, which cause indirect damage since these are electronically excited molecules which can inflict reactive damage, although they do not cause sunburn (erythema).<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors = Liebel F, Kaur S, Ruvolo E, Kollias N, Southall MD |title=Irradiation of skin with visible light induces reactive oxygen species and matrix-degrading enzymes |journal=J.

The small circles show where ionization occurs.]]\n\n====Neutrons====\n{{main article|Neutron|neutron radiation}}\n[[Neutron]]s have zero electrical charge and thus often do not ''directly'' cause ionization in a single step or interaction with matter. However, fast neutrons will interact with the protons in hydrogen via [[linear energy transfer|LET]], and this mechanism scatters the nuclei of the materials in the target area, causing direct ionization of the hydrogen atoms. When neutrons strike the hydrogen nuclei, proton radiation (fast protons) results. These protons are themselves ionizing because they are of high energy, are charged, and interact with the electrons in matter.\n\nNeutrons that strike other nuclei besides hydrogen will transfer less energy to the other particle if LET does occur. But, for many nuclei struck by neutrons, [[inelastic scattering]] occurs. Whether elastic or inelastic scatter occurs is dependent on the speed of the neutron, whether [[Neutron temperature|fast]] or [[Neutron temperature|thermal]] or somewhere in between. It is also dependent on the nuclei it strikes and its [[neutron cross section]].\n\nIn inelastic scattering, neutrons are readily absorbed in a type of [[nuclear reaction]] called [[neutron capture]] and attributes to the [[neutron activation]] of the nucleus. Neutron interactions with most types of matter in this manner usually produce [[radioactive]] nuclei. The abundant [[isotopes of oxygen|oxygen-16]] nucleus, for example, undergoes neutron activation, rapidly decays by a proton emission forming [[isotopes of nitrogen|nitrogen-16]], which decays to oxygen-16. The short-lived nitrogen-16 decay emits a powerful beta ray. This process can be written as:\n\n<blockquote><sub>16</sub>O (n,p) <sub>16</sub>N (fast neutron capture possible with >11 MeV neutron)\n<sub>16</sub>N \u2192 <sub>16</sub>O + \u03b2<sup>\u2212</sup> (Decay t<sub>1/2</sub> = 7.13 s)\nThis high-energy \u03b2<sup>\u2212</sup> further interacts rapidly with other nuclei, emitting high-energy \u03b3 via [[Bremsstrahlung]]</blockquote>\n\nWhile not a favorable reaction, the <sub>16</sub>O (n,p) <sub>16</sub>N reaction is a major source of X-rays emitted from the cooling water of a [[pressurized water reactor]] and contributes enormously to the radiation generated by a water-cooled [[nuclear reactor]] while operating.\n\nFor the best shielding of neutrons, hydrocarbons that have an abundance of [[hydrogen]] are used.\n\nIn [[fissile]] materials, secondary neutrons may produce [[nuclear chain reaction]]s, causing a larger amount of ionization from the [[daughter product]]s of fission.\n\nOutside the nucleus, free neutrons are unstable and have a mean lifetime of 14 minutes, 42 seconds. Free neutrons decay by emission of an electron and an electron antineutrino to become a proton, a process known as [[beta decay]]:<ref>{{cite journal |author=W.-M.

At the end of its path, the neutron is captured by a nucleus in an (n,\u03b3)-reaction that leads to the emission of a [[neutron capture]] photon. Such photons always have enough energy to qualify as ionizing radiation.\n\n==Physical effects==\n{{main article|Radiation damage}}\n[[File:Cyclotron with glowing beam.jpg|thumb|right|Ionized air glows blue around a beam of particulate ionizing radiation from a [[cyclotron]]]]\n\n===Nuclear effects===\nNeutron radiation, alpha radiation, and extremely energetic gamma (> ~20 MeV) can cause [[nuclear transmutation]] and [[induced radioactivity]]. The relevant mechanisms are [[neutron activation]], [[alpha absorption]], and [[photodisintegration]]. A large enough number of transmutations can change macroscopic properties and cause targets to become radioactive themselves, even after the original source is removed.\n\n===Chemical effects===\n{{main article|Radiation chemistry}}\nIonization of molecules can lead to [[radiolysis]] (breaking chemical bonds), and formation of highly reactive [[free radicals]]. These free radicals may then react chemically with neighbouring materials even after the original radiation has stopped. (e.g., [[ozone cracking]] of polymers by ozone formed by ionization of air). Ionizing radiation can also accelerate existing chemical reactions such as polymerization and corrosion, by contributing to the activation energy required for the reaction. Optical materials deteriorate under the effect of ionizing radiation.\n\nHigh-intensity ionizing radiation in air can produce a visible [[ionized air glow]] of telltale bluish-purple color. The glow can be observed, e.g., during [[criticality accident]]s, around [[mushroom cloud]]s shortly after a [[nuclear explosion]], or the inside of a damaged nuclear reactor like during the [[Chernobyl disaster]].\n\nMonatomic fluids, e.g. molten [[sodium]], have no chemical bonds to break and no crystal lattice to disturb, so they are immune to the chemical effects of ionizing radiation. Simple diatomic compounds with very negative [[enthalpy of formation]], such as [[hydrogen fluoride]] will reform rapidly and spontaneously after ionization.\n\n===Electrical effects===\nIonization of materials temporarily increases their conductivity, potentially permitting damaging current levels. This is a particular hazard in [[semiconductor]] microelectronics employed in electronic equipment, with subsequent currents introducing operation errors or even permanently damaging the devices. Devices intended for high radiation environments such as the nuclear industry and extra-atmospheric (space) applications may be made [[radiation hardening|''radiation hard'']] to resist such effects through design, material selection, and fabrication methods.\n\nProton radiation found in space can also cause [[single-event upset]]s in digital circuits.\n6\nThe electrical effects of ionizing radiation are exploited in gas-filled radiation detectors, e.g. the [[Geiger-Muller counter]] or the [[ion chamber]].\n\n==Health effects==\n{{main article|Radiobiology}}\nIn general, ionizing radiation is harmful and potentially lethal to living beings but some types have medical applications in [[radiation therapy]] for the treatment of cancer and [[thyrotoxicosis]].\n\nMost adverse health effects of exposure to ionizing radiation may be grouped in two general categories:\n*deterministic effects (harmful tissue reactions) due in large part to killing or malfunction of cells following high doses from [[radiation burn]]s.\n*stochastic effects, i.e., [[Radiation-induced cancer|cancer]] and heritable effects involving either cancer development in exposed individuals owing to [[mutation]] of somatic cells or heritable disease in their offspring owing to mutation of reproductive (germ) cells.{{sfn | ICRP | 2007 | loc= paragraph 55}}\n\nThe most common impact is stochastic [[radiation-induced cancer|induction of cancer]] with a latent period of years or decades after exposure.

The remaining 20% results from exposure to man-made radiation sources, primarily from [[medical imaging]]. Average man-made exposure is much higher in developed countries, mostly due to [[CT scans]] and [[nuclear medicine]].\n\nNatural [[background radiation]] comes from five primary sources: cosmic radiation, solar radiation, external terrestrial sources, radiation in the human body, and [[radon]].\n\nThe background rate for natural radiation varies considerably with location, being as low as 1.5&nbsp;mSv/a (1.5&nbsp;mSv per year) in some areas and over 100&nbsp;mSv/a in others. The highest level of purely natural radiation recorded on the Earth's surface is 90&nbsp;\u00b5Gy/h (0.8&nbsp;Gy/a) on a Brazilian black beach composed of [[monazite]].<ref>{{cite book|last=[[United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation]]|title=Sources and Effects of Ionizing Radiation|year=2000|publisher=United Nations|chapter-url=http://www.unscear.org/unscear/publications/2000_1.html|accessdate=11 November 2012|page=121|volume=vol. 1|chapter=Annex B|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804174956/http://www.unscear.org/unscear/publications/2000_1.html|archivedate=4 August 2012}}</ref> The highest background radiation in an inhabited area is found in [[Ramsar, Mazandaran|Ramsar]], primarily due to naturally radioactive limestone used as a building material.

Despite the high levels of background radiation that the residents of Ramsar receive there is no compelling evidence that they experience a greater health risk. The ICRP recommendations are conservative limits and may represent an over representation of the actual health risk. Generally radiation safety organization recommend the most conservative limits assuming it is best to err on the side of caution. This level of caution is appropriate but should not be used to create fear about background radiation danger. Radiation danger from background radiation may be a serious threat but is more likely a small overall risk compared to all other factors in the environment.\n\n====Cosmic radiation====\n{{see also|Cosmic ray}}\nThe Earth, and all living things on it, are constantly bombarded by radiation from outside our solar system. This cosmic radiation consists of relativistic particles: positively charged nuclei (ions) from 1 [[Atomic mass unit|amu]] [[proton]]s (about 85% of it) to 26 amu [[iron]] [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] and even beyond. (The high-atomic number particles are called [[HZE ions]].) The energy of this radiation can far exceed that which humans can create, even in the largest [[particle accelerator]]s (see [[ultra-high-energy cosmic ray]]). This radiation interacts in the atmosphere to create secondary radiation that rains down, including [[x-rays]], [[muon]]s, [[proton]]s, [[antiproton]]s, [[alpha particle]]s, [[pion]]s, [[electron]]s, [[positron]]s, and [[neutron]]s.\n\nThe [[Dose (biochemistry)|dose]] from cosmic radiation is largely from muons, neutrons, and electrons, with a dose rate that varies in different parts of the world and based largely on the geomagnetic field, altitude, and solar cycle. The cosmic-radiation dose rate on airplanes is so high that, according to the United Nations UNSCEAR 2000 Report (see links at bottom), airline flight crew workers receive more dose on average than any other worker, including those in nuclear power plants. Airline crews receive more cosmic rays if they routinely work flight routes that take them close to the North or South pole at high altitudes, where this type of radiation is maximal.\n\nCosmic rays also include high-energy gamma rays, which are far beyond the energies produced by solar or human sources.\n\n====External terrestrial sources====\nMost materials on Earth contain some radioactive [[atom]]s, even if in small quantities. Most of the dose received from these sources is from gamma-ray emitters in building materials, or rocks and soil when outside. The major [[radionuclide]]s of concern for '''terrestrial radiation''' are isotopes of [[potassium]], [[uranium]], and [[thorium]]. Each of these sources has been decreasing in activity since the formation of the Earth.\n\n====Internal radiation sources====\n{{see also|Committed dose}}\nAll earthly materials that are the building-blocks of life contain a radioactive component. As humans, plants, and animals consume food, air, and water, an inventory of radioisotopes builds up within the organism (see [[banana equivalent dose]]). Some radionuclides, like [[potassium-40]], emit a high-energy gamma ray that can be measured by sensitive electronic radiation measurement systems. These internal radiation sources contribute to an individual's total radiation dose from [[natural background radiation]].\n\n====Radon====\n{{see also|Health effects of radon}}\nAn important source of natural radiation is [[radon]] gas, which seeps continuously from bedrock but can, because of its high density, accumulate in poorly ventilated houses.\n\n[[Radon-222]] is a gas produced by the decay of [[radium]]-226. Both are a part of the natural [[uranium]] decay chain. Uranium is found in soil throughout the world in varying concentrations. Among non-smokers, radon is the largest cause of lung cancer and, overall, the second-leading cause.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/radon/healthrisks.html |title=Health Risks |website=Radon |publisher=EPA |accessdate=2012-03-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020231845/http://www.epa.gov/radon/healthrisks.html |archivedate=2008-10-20}}</ref>\n\n==Radiation exposure==\n[[File:Exposure chart-XKCD.svg|thumb|Various doses of radiation in sieverts, ranging from trivial to lethal.]]\n{{main article|Radiation protection}}\nThere are three standard ways to limit exposure:\n# '''Time''': For people exposed to radiation in addition to natural background radiation, limiting or minimizing the exposure time will reduce the dose from the radiation source.\n# '''Distance''': Radiation intensity decreases sharply with distance, according to an [[inverse-square law]] (in an absolute vacuum).<ref name=Camphausen>Camphausen KA, Lawrence RC.

Barriers of [[lead]], [[concrete]], or water are often used to give effective protection from more penetrating particles such as gamma rays and [[neutrons]]. Some radioactive materials are stored or handled underwater or by [[remote control]] in rooms constructed of thick concrete or lined with lead. There are special [[plastic]] shields that stop beta particles, and air will stop most alpha particles. The effectiveness of a material in shielding radiation is determined by its [[half-value layer|half-value thicknesses]], the thickness of material that reduces the radiation by half. This value is a function of the material itself and of the type and energy of ionizing radiation. Some generally accepted thicknesses of attenuating material are 5&nbsp;mm of aluminum for most beta particles, and 3&nbsp;inches of lead for gamma radiation.\n\nThese can all be applied to natural and man-made sources. For man-made sources the use of '''Containment''' is a major tool in reducing dose uptake and is effectively a combination of shielding and isolation from the open environment. Radioactive materials are confined in the smallest possible space and kept out of the environment such as in a [[hot cell]] (for radiation) or [[glove box]] (for contamination). [[Radioactive isotope]]s for medical use, for example, are dispensed in closed handling facilities, usually gloveboxes, while [[nuclear reactor]]s operate within closed systems with multiple barriers that keep the radioactive materials contained. Work rooms, hot cells and gloveboxes have slightly reduced air pressures to prevent escape of airborne material to the open environment.\n\nIn nuclear conflicts or civil nuclear releases [[civil defense]] measures can help reduce exposure of populations by reducing ingestion of isotopes and occupational exposure. One is the issue of [[potassium iodide]] (KI) tablets, which blocks the uptake of [[iodine-131|radioactive iodine]] (one of the major radioisotope products of [[nuclear fission]]) into the human [[thyroid]] gland.\n\n===Occupational exposure===\nOccupationally exposed individuals are controlled within the regulatory framework of the country they work in, and in accordance with any local nuclear licence constraints. These are usually based on the recommendations of the ICRP.\nThe International Commission on Radiological Protection recommends limiting artificial irradiation. For occupational exposure, the limit is 50 mSv in a single year with a maximum of 100 mSv in a consecutive five-year period.{{sfn | ICRP | 2007 }}\n\nThe radiation exposure of these individuals is carefully monitored with the use of [[dosimeter]]s and other radiological protection instruments which will measure radioactive particulate concentrations, area gamma dose readings and [[radioactive contamination]]. A legal record of dose is kept.\n\nExamples of activities where occupational exposure is a concern include:\n*Airline crew (the most exposed population)\n*[[Industrial radiography]]\n*Medical [[radiology]] and [[nuclear medicine]]<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1088/0952-4746/16/4/004|vauthors = Pattison JE, Bachmann DJ, Beddoe AH|title=Gamma Dosimetry at Surfaces of Cylindrical Containers|journal=Journal of Radiological Protection|volume= 16|issue=4|pages=249\u2013261|year=1996|bibcode = 1996JRP....16..249P }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1097/00004032-199911000-00006|author=Pattison, J.E.|title= Finger Doses Received during Samarium-153 Injections|journal=Health Physics|volume=77|issue=5|pages=530\u20135|year=1999|pmid=10524506}}</ref>\n*Uranium mining\n*[[Nuclear power plant]] and [[nuclear fuel reprocessing plant]] workers\n*Research laboratories (government, university and private)\n\nSome human-made radiation sources affect the body through direct radiation, known as [[effective dose (radiation)]] while others take the form of [[radioactive contamination]] and [[irradiate]] the body from within. The latter is known as [[committed dose]].\n\n===Public exposure===\nMedical procedures, such as diagnostic [[X-ray]]s, [[nuclear medicine]], and [[radiation therapy]] are by far the most significant source of human-made radiation exposure to the general public. Some of the major [[radionuclide]]s used are [[I-131]], [[Tc-99m]], [[Co-60]], [[iridium|Ir-192]], and [[caesium|Cs-137]]. The public also is exposed to radiation from consumer products, such as [[tobacco]] ([[polonium]]-210), combustible fuels (gas, [[coal]], etc.), [[television]]s, luminous [[watch]]es and dials ([[tritium]]), airport [[X-ray]] systems, [[smoke detector]]s ([[americium]]), electron tubes, and gas lantern mantles ([[thorium]]).\n\nOf lesser magnitude, members of the public are exposed to radiation from the [[nuclear fuel]] cycle, which includes the entire sequence from processing [[uranium]] to the disposal of the spent fuel. The effects of such exposure have not been reliably measured due to the extremely low doses involved. Opponents use a cancer per dose model to assert that such activities cause several hundred cases of cancer per year, an application of the widely accepted [[Linear no-threshold model]] (LNT).\n\nThe International Commission on Radiological Protection recommends limiting artificial irradiation to the public to an average of 1&nbsp;mSv (0.001&nbsp;Sv) of effective dose per year, not including medical and occupational exposures.{{sfn | ICRP | 2007 }}\n\nIn a [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]], gamma rays from both the initial weapon explosion and [[Nuclear fallout|fallout]] would be the sources of radiation exposure.\n\n====Spaceflight====\nMassive particles are a concern for astronauts outside the [[earth's magnetic field]] who would receive solar particles from [[solar proton event]]s (SPE) and [[galactic cosmic rays]] from cosmic sources. These high-energy charged nuclei are blocked by Earth's magnetic field but pose a [[Health threat from cosmic rays|major health concern]] for astronauts traveling to the moon and to any distant location beyond the earth orbit. Highly charged HZE ions in particular are known to be extremely damaging, although protons make up the vast majority of galactic cosmic rays.
