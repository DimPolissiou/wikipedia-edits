Trains are the cheapest and most used form of transport. Khayelitsha has six rail stations: Mandalay, Nolungile, Nonkqubela, Khayelitsha, Kuyasa and Chris Hani.  There are also a number of bus stations and taxi ranks, although most taxis still pick up passengers on the main roads. Khayelitsha's busiest roads are Mew Way, Spine Road, Lansdowne Road, Walter Sisulu Road, Bonga Drive and Baden Powell Drive.\n\n===Health care===\n'''Khayelitsha Hospital'''\nKhayelitsha District Hospital was opened in February 2012. The hospital is a public health facility with a status of a District Hospital. This hospital operates in the Khayelitsha Health District of the Metro Region and is under the mandate of the Western Cape Department of Health. The 300-bed medical facility provides support to the surrounding primary healthcare facilities to ensure that patients receive care at the lowest level of entry into the healthcare system. The facility came as a relief to the ever growing populous Khayelitsha township. It offers district level care including a large 24-hour emergency centre, medical wards, surgical wards, obstetric wards, gynaecology wards, paediatric wards and nursery.\n\n'''Khayelitsha Community Health Clinic (CHC)'''\n\nThere are three provincial government clinics in Khayelitsha. Khayelitsha (Site B) CHC (Community Health Clinic), Michael Maphongwana (Harare) CHC and Nolungile (Site C) CHC and Kuyasa Children's Clinic which was built in 2012 are the other provincial government clinics.\n\n'''Khayelitsha Clinincs'''\n\nThere are also numerous small municipal clinics throughout the township. These clinics play an important role as centres of primary healthcare by providing a variety of healthcare services to children, women and, youth and men's health. Services offered at these include child health, family planning, TB treatment, HIV testing, Pap smears and treatment and diagnosis of sexually transmitted infections. These health facilities are managed and operated by the local government authority of the City of Cape Town.\n\nKuyasa Community Day Centre - \nNtlazana Street, Kuyasa, Khayelitsha\n\nKuyasa Men's Clinic - \nWalter Sisulu Road, Khayelitsha\n\nLuvuyo Community Day Centre -\nHlela Road, Bus Terminus, Makhaza, Khayelitsha\n\nMatthew Goniwe Community Health Centre -\nKhwahlaza Road, Makhaza, Khayelitsha\n\nMayenzeke Clinic -\nFundana Road, Makhaza, Khayelitsha\n\nNolungile Clinic - \nSolomon Tshuku Road, Site C, Khayelitsha\n\nNolungile Youth Centre - \nSolomon Tshuku Road, Site C, Khayelitsha\n\nSite B Men's Clinic - \nCnr Bunga and Sulani Drive, Site B, Khayelitsha\n\nSite B Youth Centre - \nCnr of Pama and Lwandle Road, Site B, Khayelitsha\n\nSite C Men's Clinic - \nSite C taxi rank, Khayelitsha\n\n<ref>https://www.westerncape.gov.za/directories/facilities/944</ref>\n\n==Society and culture==\n{{external media\n|width = 20%\n|image1 = [https://www.fifa.com/newscentre/photogallery/gallery=1114972.html#1114980 Image gallery] of the [[FIFA]] [[Football for Hope]] centre construction in Khayelitsha\n}}\n[[File:Monwabisi Beach Resort, False Bay.jpg|thumb|800px|center|Monwabisi beach, showing the wall constructed to create a cove]]\n\n===Beaches and recreation===\nKhayelitsha has one beach, Monwabisi, located on the coast of [[False Bay]].

[[Eagle's Nest Hill]] is often called the highest point of the city; but, with a height of only {{convert|199|m|sp=us}}, or {{convert|214|m|sp=us}} according to other sources, it is the highest point of the downtown area, but not of the whole city.\n\nLocated in the extreme South East of [[Asian Russia]], Vladivostok is geographically closer to [[Anchorage, Alaska]] and even [[Darwin, Australia]] than it is to the nation's capital of [[Moscow]]. In fact, Vladivostok is closer to [[Honolulu, Hawaii]] than to the Russian city of [[Sochi]].\n\n===Climate===\nVladivostok has a monsoon-influenced [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Dwb'') with warm, humid and rainy summers and cold, dry winters. Owing to the influence of the [[Siberian High]], winters are far colder than a latitude of 43 degrees north should warrant given its low elevation and coastal location, with a January average of {{convert|-12.3|C}}. Since the maritime influence is strong in summer, Vladivostok has a relatively cold annual climate for its latitude. Vladivostok's yearly mean of around {{convert|5|C|F}} is some ten degrees lower than in cities on the [[French Riviera]] on a similar coastal latitude in Europe on the other extreme. Winters especially are around {{convert|20|C-change}} colder than on the mildest coastlines this far north, and are considerably colder than locations on the North America east coast at similar latitudes such as [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]] and [[Portland, Maine]].\n\nIn winter, temperatures can drop below {{convert|-20|C}} while mild spells of weather can raise daytime temperatures above freezing. The average monthly precipitation, mainly in the form of snow, is around {{convert|18.5|mm|sp=us}} from December to March. Snow is common during winter, but individual snowfalls are light, with a maximum snow depth of only {{convert|5|cm|sp=us}} in January. During winter, clear sunny days are common.\n\nSummers are warm, humid and rainy, due to the East Asian [[monsoon]]. The warmest month is August, with an average temperature of {{convert|+19.8|C}}. Vladivostok receives most of its [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] during the summer months, and most summer days see some rainfall. Cloudy days are fairly common and because of the frequent rainfall, humidity is high, on average about 90% from June to August.\n\nOn average, Vladivostok receives {{convert|840|mm|sp=us}} per year, but the driest year was 1943, when {{convert|418|mm|sp=us}} of precipitation fell, and the wettest was 1974, with {{convert|1272|mm|sp=us}} of precipitation. The winter months from December to March are dry, and in some years they have seen no measurable precipitation at all. Extremes range from {{convert|-31.4|C}} in January 1931 to {{convert|+33.6|C}} in July 1939.<ref name=\"pogoda\">{{Cite web\n |url=http://www.pogodaiklimat.ru/climate/31960.htm\n |script-title=ru:\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0442 \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043a\u0430\n |trans-title=Climate of Vladivostok\n |website=\u041f\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0438 \u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0442 (Weather and Climate)\n |accessdate=June 19, 2013\n |language=Russian}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}{{Vladivostok weatherbox}}\n\n==Politics==\n[[File:\u0417\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0414\u0443\u043c\u044b \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043a\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0443\u043b. \u0421\u0443\u0445\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430-2010-06-03.jpg|thumb|right|Vladivostok City department of the [[Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations]]]]\nHead of the city of Vladivostok on the principles of unity of command directs the administration of the city of Vladivostok in accordance with federal laws, the laws of the [[Primorsky Krai]], and the charter of the city.

In addition, the city hosted the \"[[VladiROCKstok]]\" International Music Festival in September 1996. Hosted by the mayor and governor, and organized by two young American expatriates, the festival drew nearly 10,000 people and top-tier musical acts from St. Petersburg ([[Akvarium]] and [[DDT (band)|DDT]]) and Seattle ([[Supersuckers]], [[Goodness (band)|Goodness]]), as well as several leading local bands. {{citation needed|date = March 2008}}\n\nNowadays there is another annual music festival in Vladivostok, Vladivostok Rocks International Music Festival and Conference (V-ROX). Vladivostok Rocks is a three-day open-air city festival and international conference for the music industry and contemporary cultural management.

Neveskogo, Nagornyy Park, Skver im. Sukhanova, Fantaziya Park, Skver Rybatskoy Slavy, Skver im. A.I.Shchetininoy.\n\n===Pokrovskiy Park===\nPokrovskiy Park was once a cemetery. Converted into a park in 1934 but was closed in 1990.  Since 1990 the land the park sits on belongs to the Russian Orthodox Church.  During the rebuilding of the Orthodox Church, graves were found.\n\n===Minny Gorodok===\nMinny Gorodok is a {{convert|91|acres|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} public park. Minny Gorodok means \"Mine Borough Park\" in English. The park is a former military base that was founded in 1880. The military base was used for storing mines in underground storage. Converted into a park in 1985, Minny Gorodok contains several lakes, ponds, and an ice-skating rink.\n\n===Detsky Razvlekatelny Park===\nDetsky Razvlekatelny Park is a children's amusement park located near the centre of the city.  The park contains a carousel, gaming machines, a Ferris wheel, caf\u00e9s, an aquarium, cinema, and a stadium.\n\n===Admiralsky Skver===\nAdmiralsky Skver is a landmark located near the city's centre.  The Square is an open space, dominated by the Triumfalnaya Arka. South of the square sits a museum of [[Soviet submarine S-56]].\n\n==Pollution==\nLocal ecologists from the ''Ecocenter'' organization have claimed that much of Vladivostok's suburbs are [[pollution|polluted]] and that living in them can be classified as a health hazard.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} The pollution has a number of causes, according to ''Ecocenter'' geo-chemical expert Sergey Shlykov. Vladivostok has about eighty industrial sites, which may not be many compared to Russia's most industrialized areas, but those around the city are particularly environmentally unfriendly, such as shipbuilding and repairing, power stations, printing, fur farming, and mining.\n\nIn addition, Vladivostok has a particularly vulnerable geography which compounds the effect of pollution. Winds cannot clear pollution from some of the most densely populated areas around the Pervaya and Vtoraya Rechka as they sit in basins which the winds blow over. In addition, there is little snow in winter and no leaves or grass to catch the dust to make it settle down.<ref name=\"Ecocenter\">B.&nbsp;V.&nbsp;Preobrazhensky, A.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;Burago, S.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Shlykov.

[[Eagle's Nest Hill]] is often called the highest point of the city; but, with a height of only {{convert|199|m|sp=us}}, or {{convert|214|m|sp=us}} according to other sources, it is the highest point of the downtown area, but not of the whole city.\n\nLocated in the extreme South East of [[Asian Russia]], Vladivostok is geographically closer to [[Anchorage, Alaska]] and even [[Darwin, Australia]] than it is to the nation's capital of [[Moscow]]. In fact, Vladivostok is closer to [[Honolulu, Hawaii]] than to the Russian city of [[Sochi]].\n\n===Climate===\nVladivostok has a monsoon-influenced [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Dwb'') with warm, humid and rainy summers and cold, dry winters. Owing to the influence of the [[Siberian High]], winters are far colder than a latitude of 43 degrees north should warrant given its low elevation and coastal location, with a January average of {{convert|-12.3|C}}. Since the maritime influence is strong in summer, Vladivostok has a relatively cold annual climate for its latitude. Vladivostok's yearly mean of around {{convert|5|C|F}} is some ten degrees lower than in cities on the [[French Riviera]] on a similar coastal latitude in Europe on the other extreme. Winters especially are around {{convert|20|C-change}} colder than on the mildest coastlines this far north, and are considerably colder than locations on the North America east coast at similar latitudes such as [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]] and [[Portland, Maine]].\n\nIn winter, temperatures can drop below {{convert|-20|C}} while mild spells of weather can raise daytime temperatures above freezing. The average monthly precipitation, mainly in the form of snow, is around {{convert|18.5|mm|sp=us}} from December to March. Snow is common during winter, but individual snowfalls are light, with a maximum snow depth of only {{convert|5|cm|sp=us}} in January. During winter, clear sunny days are common.\n\nSummers are warm, humid and rainy, due to the East Asian [[monsoon]]. The warmest month is August, with an average temperature of {{convert|+19.8|C}}. Vladivostok receives most of its [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] during the summer months, and most summer days see some rainfall.

Vladivostok has about eighty industrial sites, which may not be many compared to Russia's most industrialized areas, but those around the city are particularly environmentally unfriendly, such as shipbuilding and repairing, power stations, printing, fur farming, and mining.\n\nIn addition, Vladivostok has a particularly vulnerable geography which compounds the effect of pollution. Winds cannot clear pollution from some of the most densely populated areas around the Pervaya and Vtoraya Rechka as they sit in basins which the winds blow over. In addition, there is little snow in winter and no leaves or grass to catch the dust to make it settle down.<ref name=\"Ecocenter\">B.&nbsp;V.&nbsp;Preobrazhensky, A.&nbsp;I.&nbsp;Burago, S.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Shlykov.

The series originally aired in the United States on the [[Cookie Jar Toons]] block on [[This TV]] and it is currently{{when|date=March 2020}} broadcast in Canada on the [[Oprah Winfrey Network (Canadian TV channel)|Viva]], [[Bravo!]] and [[VisionTV|Vision TV]] cable channels. The series, produced by [[Salter Street Films]], was based on the ''[[Emily of New Moon]]'' series of novels by [[Lucy Maud Montgomery]]. The series consisted of three seasons of thirteen episodes and one season of seven episodes, for a total of forty-six episodes produced. The executive producers were [[Micheline Charest]], [[Michael Donovan]], and [[Ronald Weinberg]].\n\n==Series overview==\nThe series starred [[Martha MacIsaac]] as the titular [[orphan]] Emily Starr. [[Susan Clark]] and [[Sheila McCarthy]] played Emily's aunts Elizabeth and Laura, who had taken on the responsibility of raising Emily following her father's death, and [[Stephen McHattie]] played her cousin Jimmy. Susan Clark left the series after the first season when her character, Elizabeth, was killed off.\n\nRecurring cast included [[Chip Chuipka]] as Mr. Carpenter, [[Peter Donaldson (actor)|Peter Donaldson]] as Ian Bowles, [[Richard Donat]] as Dr. Burnley, [[Kris Lemche]] as Perry Miller, [[John Neville (actor)|John Neville]] as Uncle Malcolm, [[Jessica Pellerin]] as Ilse Burnley, [[Shawn Roberts]] as Teddy Kent, and [[Linda Thorson]] as Cousin Isabel.\n\nGuest stars included [[Janet Wright]], [[Phyllis Diller]], [[Martha Burns]], [[Maury Chaykin]], [[Martha Henry]], [[Lisa Houle]], [[William Hutt (Canadian actor)|William Hutt]], [[Michael Moriarty]], [[Barbara Feldon]], [[Macha Grenon]] and [[Claire Rankin]].\n\n==Plot==\nThis is the story of a young [[orphan]] girl named Emily Starr who is sent to live at New Moon Farm on [[Prince Edward Island]] with her aunts Elizabeth and Laura Murray and her Cousin Jimmy after her father dies of [[tuberculosis]]. She makes friends with Ilse Burnley, Teddy Kent, and Perry Miller, the hired boy, who Aunt Elizabeth looks down upon because he was born in 'Stovepipe Town', a poorer district.\n\nEach of the children has a special gift. Emily was born to be a writer, Teddy is a gifted artist, Ilse is a talented [[elocutionist]], and Perry has the makings of a great politician. They also each have a few problems with their families. Emily has a hard time getting along with Aunt Elizabeth, who does not understand her need to write. Ilse's father, Dr. Burnley, ignores Ilse most of the time because of a dreadful secret concerning Ilse's mother. Teddy's mother is jealous of her son's talents and friends, fearing that his love for them will eclipse his love for her; as a result, she hates Emily, Teddy's drawings, and even his pets.  Perry is not as well off as the other three, so his Aunt Tom once tries to make Emily promise to marry Perry when they grow up, threatening that unless Emily does so, she will not pay for Perry's schooling.\n\nOther unforgettable characters are Dean \"Jarback\" Priest, a quiet, mysterious cynic who wants something he fears is ever unattainable; fiery Mr Carpenter, the crusty old schoolteacher who is Emily's mentor and honest critic when it comes to evaluating her stories and poems; \"simple\" Cousin Jimmy, who recites his poetry when the spirit moves him; Aunt Laura, who is the kind aunt; and strict, suspicious Aunt Elizabeth who yet proves to be an unexpected ally in times of trouble.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Martha MacIsaac]] as Emily Byrd Starr\n* [[Stephen McHattie]] as Cousin Jimmy Murray\n* [[Sheila McCarthy]] as Aunt Laura Murray\n* [[Susan Clark]] as Aunt Elizabeth Murray\n* [[Linda Thorson]] as Cousin Isabel Murray\n* [[Jessica Pellerin]] as Ilse Burnley\n* [[Shawn Roberts]] as Teddy Kent\n* [[Kris Lemche]] as Perry Miller\n* [[John Neville (actor)|John Neville]] as Uncle Malcolm Murray\n* [[Chip Chuipka]] as Mr. Francis Carpenter\n* [[Peter Donaldson (actor)|Peter Donaldson]] as Ian Bowles\n* [[Richard Donat]] as Dr. Burnley\n* [[Marlene O'Brien]] as Mrs. Stuart\n* [[Emily Cara Cook]] as Rhoda Stuart\n* [[Carroll Godsman]] as Mildred Kent\n* [[Aaron Ashmore]] as Harrison Bowles\n\n'''Guest Stars'''\n* [[Michael Moriarty]] as Douglas Starr\n* [[Janet Wright]] as Aunt Thom\n* [[Phyllis Diller]] as Great Aunt Nancy Priest\n* [[Martha Burns]] as Eve Kinch\n* [[Maury Chaykin]] as Lofty John\n* [[Martha Henry]] as Megan Moore\n* [[Lisa Houle]] as Eve Kinch/Dr. Iris Campbell/Iris Burnley\n* [[William Hutt (Canadian actor)|William Hutt]] as Reverend Pitch/Satan\n* [[Barbara Feldon]] as Madame Marlena\n* [[Macha Grenon]] as Nadine\n* [[Claire Rankin]] as Juliet Starr\n* [[Ken Leckey]] as Officer Finchley\n* [[Sarah Briand]] as Young Emily\n* [[Peter Levi]] as Wowkiss\n* [[William Greenblatt]] as Duncan McHugh\n\n==Production==\nThe series was developed by Marlene Matthews, who also wrote or co-wrote nineteen episodes of the series and served as one of the producers for the first three years.

In the front row are the main [[Gauls|Gaulish]] characters, plus [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Cleopatra]].]]\nThis is a list of characters in the ''[[Asterix]]'' comics.\n\n==Main characters==\nAsterix, Obelix and Dogmatix are the first characters with short descriptions usually listed at the beginning of each of the ''Asterix'' books (after the map of Gaul). They each have separate articles containing more information. Unless otherwise stated, this article uses the names chosen for the English translations of the books.\n\n===Asterix===\n{{Main|Asterix (character)}}\nAsterix is the main character. He is a brave, intelligent and shrewd warrior of somewhat diminutive size, who eagerly volunteers for all perilous missions.\n* {{lang-fr|Ast\u00e9rix}} (from ''{{lang|fr|ast\u00e9risque}}'', meaning \"[[asterisk]]\", which is the typographical symbol * indicating a footnote, from the Hellenic (Greek) word \u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1 (''aster''), meaning a \"star\"). As the titular character, he is usually the star of the story. His name is usually left unchanged in translations, aside from accents and the use of local [[alphabet]]s: for example, in [[Esperanto]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Slovene language|Slovene]], [[Latvian language|Latvian]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] it is ''Asteriks'', although in Turkish he was first named ''B\u00fcc\u00fcr'' meaning \"shorty\", but the name was then changed. \n*In [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], he is known as ''\u00c1str\u00edkur'' (\"Rich of love\").\n*In [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]], {{lang|si|\u0dc3\u0dd2\u0d82\u0dc4\u0dbd}} ({{transl|si|Soora Pappa}}) could be interpreted as 'heroic grandfather'.\n\n===Obelix===\n{{Main|Obelix}}\nObelix is Asterix's closest friend and works as a [[menhir]] sculptor and delivery man. He is a tall, [[obese]] man (he refers to himself as \"well-padded\" or \"man with a slipped chest\" and will immediately knock out anyone who calls him \"fat\") with two notable attributes: his permanently phenomenal strength and his voracious appetite for food, especially [[wild boar]]. His strength results from having fallen into Getafix's magic potion cauldron as a baby. As a consequence, Getafix will not let him take additional potion for fear of side effects (for example, turning into stone, as shown in ''Asterix and Obelix all at Sea''), something that Obelix finds immensely unfair. The only exception was in ''Asterix and Cleopatra'' when they were trapped in a [[pyramid]] and Getafix allows him to have three drops of the magic potion. Obelix's size is often the brunt of many jokes. In ''Asterix and the Big Fight'', a druid mistakes Obelix for a patient with an [[eating disorder]]. At the end of the book, Obelix decides to go on a diet, but quickly goes back to eating huge quantities of boar.\n\n* [[French language|French]]: ''Ob\u00e9lix'': meaning either ''ob\u00e9lisque'' \"[[obelisk]]\", a massive monument, or the [[dagger (typography)|typographical symbol]] (<big>\u2020</big>) (also called an ''obelus'' in English) which is sometimes used to indicate a second footnote if the first footnote is indicated by an asterisk. His name is also almost never changed in official translations (not counting orthographical variations such as ''Obeliks'' in e.g. [[Esperanto]], [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Slovene language|Slovene]]). Obelix can also mean \"man of the boars\" since the Hellenic (Greek) word \u039f\u03b2\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 (Obelias/Ovelias) means pig or boar.\n* In Icelandic, his name is ''Steinr\u00edkur'', roughly meaning \"rich in stone\", due to Obelix's fascination with stones.\n* Early [[Turkish Language|Turkish]] editions called him ''Hopdediks'', after ''{{lang|tr|Hop dedik!}}'', which is a phrase uttered when someone overdoes something. In more recent albums he is ''Oburiks'', after ''{{lang|tr|obur}}'', which means \"gluttonous\".\n\n===Dogmatix===\n\n{{Main|Dogmatix}}\n\n:First appearance: ''[[Asterix and the Banquet]]'' (book 5 in France), page 8.\nDogmatix is Obelix's pet dog. Unlike his immense master, Dogmatix is very tiny, but he can have a nasty temper. Dogmatix loves nature and hates to see trees suffer. (Obelix once mentions that this is because Dogmatix likes to urinate on them.) Dogmatix met Asterix and Obelix in Lutetia (in ''Asterix and the Banquet'') and followed them all the way around Gaul until Obelix finally noticed him when they reached the village and Dogmatix barked behind him. Since then, Obelix has become very affectionate toward Dogmatix. In ''[[Asterix and the Chieftain's Shield]]'', Obelix gets angry with hungry people who try to take Dogmatix's bone and insists they will be punished if they try to take advantage of his dog. Dogmatix is relatively intelligent, and is particularly good as a hunting dog.  His most noteworthy moments were rescuing Asterix, Obelix and Getafix from entrapment in ''[[Asterix and Cleopatra|Cleopatra]]'', finding the captured Asterix in ''[[Asterix and the Great Crossing|Great Crossing]]'', and locating the much needed desert petroleum in ''[[Asterix and the Black Gold|Black Gold]]''.\n\n* {{lang-fr|Id\u00e9fix}} (''{{lang|fr|id\u00e9e fixe}}'', a \"fixed idea\" or \"obsession\", also a \"prejudice\"). Most translations use some variant of this original name (e.g. ''Ideafix'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], ''Idefiks'' in [[Esperanto]] and [[Polish language|Polish]], and ''\u0130defiks'' in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]).\n*In [[Danish language|Danish]], [[German language|German]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Polish language|Polish]], ''Idefix''\n*In [[English language|English]], ''Dogmatix'' comes from ''[[dogma]]tic''&nbsp;\u2014 clinging to an unchanging set of beliefs. The pun is extended because the name also contains the word \"dog\".\n*[[Hindi language|Hindi]]&nbsp;\u2014 In the \u092e\u0927\u0941 \u092e\u0941\u0938\u094d\u0915\u093e\u0928 (''[[Madhu Muskan]]'') translations, Dogmatix has been called ''Kutta Bhaunkix'' (\"the dog who barks\")\n*In [[Bengali language|Bengali]], he is known as ''Gnoyartumix'' (\u0997\u09cb\u0981\u09af\u09bc\u09be\u09b0\u09cd\u09a4\u09c1\u09ae\u09bf\u0995\u09cd\u09b8)&nbsp;\u2014 compare the Bengali term ''{{lang|bn-Latn|gNyoyartumi}}'', which means \"being dogmatic\".\n*In [[Croatian language|Croatian]], he is known as ''Snupix'' (reference to Snoopy) and Fidofiks, and in newest translation as Malix (\"the little one\").\n*In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], \u05de\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05e7\u05e1 (''Mavrix'') means \"bright\".\n*In [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], it is ''Mirnixdirnix'' (quickly, immediately; a winged German loan word/expression), ''T\u00f6pszlix'' which refers to his small size, or ''Idefix'', ca. \"here for sure\" referring to fetching.\n*In [[Serbian language|Serbian]], it is \u0418\u0434\u0435\u0444\u0438\u043a\u0441 (''Idefiks''&nbsp;\u2014 directly taken from the French ''Id\u00e9fix'') or \u0413\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043a\u0441 (''Garoviks'', from ''{{lang|sr|garov}}'', a common name for a dog of indeterminable breed)\n*In [[Greek language|Greek]] early translations, he was called ''Katrulix'' (\u039a\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03af\u03be) meaning \"he who pees himself\". However, this was considered too demeaning by the readers, and thus was changed to ''Idefix'' (\u0399\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c6\u03af\u03be)\n*In [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], ''Ideiafix'', a Portuguese variation (''Ideia Fixa'') of the original French name\n*In [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]&nbsp;\u2014 In the {{lang|si|\u0dc3\u0dd2\u0d82\u0dc4\u0dbd}} {{transl|si|Chuti Kuku}} which is a name for a dog\n*In [[Italian language|Italian]]&nbsp;\u2014 ''Idefix'' but in the movie ''Asterix and Cleopatra'' he is called ''Ercolino'' (\"Little Hercules\")\n*In [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]&nbsp;\u2014 ''Kr\u00edlr\u00edkur''\n\n==Major recurring characters==\nAt the beginning of most of the Asterix books, immediately after the map of Gaul, and before the narrative starts, there is a standard description of the main characters above, as well as Getafix, Cacofonix and Vitalstatistix (regardless of their importance in that particular book).\n\n:The first appearance of all the major characters is in ''[[Asterix the Gaul]]'' unless otherwise noted. Notes are given for languages which have translations of 90% or more of the albums&nbsp;\u2014 primarily European languages along with [[Brazilian Portuguese]]. ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] also falls in this category, but it leaves the French names unchanged. Languages which do not use the \"x\" (such as those of [[Eastern Europe]] like [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Baltic languages]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Esperanto]]) substitute \"ks\" in translations; \"c\" is also not used in some (such as Polish, Greek and Basque) which substitute \"k\" or \"z\" for hard and soft \"c\" respectively in names that are otherwise unaltered.\n\n===Getafix===\n[[File:Getafix the druid.jpg|right|thumb|175px|Asterix and Getafix]]\nGetafix is the village [[druid]]. In appearance, he is tall with a long white [[beard]], white robe, red cloak. He is usually seen in possession of a small golden [[sickle]]. While his age is never stated, in the story of Asterix's birth (in which all but the oldest villagers are seen as small children), he appears unchanged. In ''[[Asterix and the Big Fight]]'', the druid Psychoanalytix (who appears quite old) refers to him as his elder and teacher. In ''[[Asterix and Obelix's Birthday: The Golden Book]]'', as a gag, Getafix at 50 years older appears to be frail and old, while in the other books, he appeared healthy.\n\nAlthough known for his strength-enhancing magic potion, he has many other magical and medicinal potions at his disposal, including a potion to make hair grow quickly, a potion to counteract poison, one that neutralizes a drug that would kill in a matter of days, and a potion that restores a person to full health after injury (although this potion also causes the person who takes it to lose their recent memories while also interacting badly with the magic potion). Aside from making the potion, he also acts as the village doctor and occasional teacher. Asterix (and most other villagers) will consult him whenever anything strange occurs. He does not engage normally himself in combat, whereas most of the villagers enjoy a good punch-up (even with each other). One exception is one of the stories explaining Gaulish women, using Mrs. Geriatrix as an example, in which he involves himself in a fight sparked by Impedimenta. The final cut is shown with all the male villagers and two females, Impedimenta and Bacteria included, with Getafix running to stop the fight, with a piece of fish flying towards him. His most notable brawl is when, masquerading as a cook in ''[[Asterix and the Great Divide|The Great Divide]]'', he makes and partakes of the magic potion (passing it off as soup) to free the enslaved men from the divided village, captured by the Romans&nbsp;\u2014 and doing a test run on the slaves who were present&nbsp;\u2014 and then starts distributing slaps with obvious enjoyment.\n\nAs the only individual able to produce the \"magic potion\" upon which the villagers rely for their strength, he is the focus of many stories, ranging from the Romans attempting to put him out of commission in some manner to requesting that Asterix and Obelix help him find some missing ingredient, and the conscience of the village. On a few occasions, he has refused to make the potion when the villagers become too selfish, including in ''[[Asterix and Caesar's Gift]]'', where he refused to provide the potion for anyone while the village was divided by an upcoming vote for a new chief, only to provide them with it once again when Vitalstatistix asked Getafix to provide the potion for Orthopedix, the man he had been running against for chief. He has also occasionally been taken prisoner by hostile forces to get access to the potion, only to be freed again thanks to Asterix and Obelix. The full recipe of the magic potion itself has never been revealed, but known ingredients are mistletoe (which must be cut with a golden sickle [''[[Asterix and the Golden Sickle]]'']), a whole lobster (an optional ingredient that improves the flavour), fresh fish, salt, and petroleum (called rock oil in the book), which is later replaced by beetroot juice. Replenishing the stores of ingredients for the magic potion has led to some adventures for Asterix and Obelix, including ''[[Asterix and the Great Crossing]]'' and ''[[Asterix and the Black Gold]]''.\n\nGetafix is very similar to many [[wise old man|wise old men]] who act as mentors and father-figures to the heroes, such as [[Merlin]] or [[Gandalf]]. In the earlier books however, Getafix came across more as just a friend of the protagonists rather than a wise old counselor. He was also, from the very beginning, shown as a figure of fun and had a wonderful sense of humour: in ''[[Asterix the Gaul]]'', he keeps cutting his finger while using his [[sickle]] and roars with uncontrollable laughter at Asterix's teasing of the Roman Centurion; in ''[[Asterix and the Big Fight]]'', he was shown as going literally crazy; and he's not above making the occasional bad pun (such as in ''Asterix and the Great Divide'', when one of the village's frequent \"stale fish\" fights prompts him to observe that the villagers may soon discover nuclear \"fish-ion\").\n\n*[[French language|French]]: ''Panoramix'' (From Hellenic/Greek \u03a0\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03b1/Panorama which means wide view, \u03a0\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03af\u03be/Panoramix or \"he who sees everything\")&nbsp;\u2014 in most European translations this name is used, including [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Latin language|Latin]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Portuguese Language|Portuguese]], [[Slovene language|Slovene]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Spanish Language|Spanish]], [[Indonesian Language|Indonesian]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Greek language|Greek]], Asturian and [[Romanian language|Romanian]].\n*In [[English language|English]], the name is a pun on \"getting a fix\"&nbsp;\u2014 obtaining a dose of a recreational drug, and a reference to the magic potion he produces; the phrase can also mean to perceive or to get a solid sense of something. In the short-lived American version of the series, he was called ''Magigimmix'' (\"magic gimmicks\"). He was called ''[[RMC Group|Readymix]]'' (the name of a British cement firm) in newspaper comics during the 1970s, as ''Getafix'' was considered inappropriate for children. In the English version of the ''Asterix the Gaul'' film, he is referred to by his original French name of ''Panoramix'' and in the American dub of the ''Asterix and the Big Fight'' film he is called ''Vitamix''.\n*In [[German language|German]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], he is known as ''Miraculix'', from Latin ''miraculum'' (''miracle'').\n*In [[Serbian language|Serbian]], he is known as \u0410\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0441 (''Aspiriniks''), from the drug [[Aspirin]]. Also in certain translations is known as \u041f\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0438\u043a\u0441 (''Panoramiks'').\n*In [[Croatian language|Croatian]], he is known as ''\u010cudomiks'', from ''{{lang|hr|\u010dudo}}'' (\"miracle\") and ''{{lang|hr|miks}}'' (\"mix\"). In newest translation it is ''Faktorix''.\n*In [[Finnish language|Finnish]], he is ''Akvavitix'', from \"[[akvavit]]\", a [[Scandinavia]]n [[distilled beverage]] (derived from ''[[Aqua vitae]]'').\n*In [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]], his name is ''Crudemix'', \"Cruden\" being [[herbs]] and [[spices]], his name thus means \"Spice mix\".\n*In [[Esperanto]], he is ''Miraklomiks'', from ''{{lang|eo|miraklo}}'' (\"miracle\") and ''{{lang|eo|mikso}}'' (\"mix\")\n*In [[Hindi Language|Hindi]], he is \u0939\u0915\u0940\u092e \u0935\u0948\u0927\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0938 (''Hakeem Vaidhix''), Hindi for a \"village doctor\".\n*In [[Hungarian Language|Hungarian]], he is ''Magicoturmix'', which is a composition of \"magic\" and \"shake\", thus meaning \"Shake of Magic\". Actually, this is a reference to the potion he is brewing, which gives the villagers their wondrous superhuman strength.\n*In [[Bengali language|Bengali]], he is ''Etashetamix'' (\u098f\u099f\u09be\u09b8\u09c7\u099f\u09be\u09ae\u09bf\u0995\u09cd\u09b8), meaning \"mix this and that\".\n*In [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], he is ''Sj\u00f3\u00f0r\u00edkur'', roughly meaning \"one who boils\". In comparison, Asterix is ''\u00c1str\u00edkur'', \"one who loves\".\n*In [[Hebrew Language|Hebrew]], \u05d0\u05e9\u05e4\u05d9\u05e7\u05e1 (''Ashafix''), meaning \"master of the craft\".\n*In [[Welsh Language|Welsh]], he is ''Crycymalix'', a pun on the phrase ''{{lang|cy|cryd cymalau}}'', which means \"arthritis\" or \"rheumatism\", referring to his old age.\n*In [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]&nbsp;\u2014 {{lang|si|\u0dc3\u0dd2\u0d82\u0dc4\u0dbd}} ({{transl|si|Vedha Pappa}}) which means a \"[[druid]]\" or \"[[witch]]\".\n*In Malaysia, the English version that was released in the newspapers, he was \"Medix\" due to the strict laws in the country against drug abuse.\n*In [[Russian Language|Russian]], he is ''\u041f\u043e\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0441'' (''Pochinix''), meaning \"he who repairs things\". The name was translated from the English version, not the French, but the pun about \"getting a fix\" was lost in translation. However, the druid is named \"\u041f\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0438\u043a\u0441\" (\"Panoramix\") in all live-action films and Asterix: The Mansions of the Gods.\n*In [[Scots language|Scots]], he is named ''Kensawthetrix'', meaning \"knows all the tricks\".\n\n===Vitalstatistix===\n\nChief Vitalstatistix is the chief of the [[Gaul]]ish village. He is a middle-aged, bigbellied man with red hair, [[pigtail]]s and a huge [[moustache]]. He is generally reasonable, well-informed, fearless, (comparatively) even-tempered and unambitious&nbsp;\u2014 the last much to the chagrin of his wife [[#Impedimenta|Impedimenta]]. His major failings are his love of good food and drink (it is unlikely to be a coincidence that his wife is the best cook in the village)&nbsp;\u2014 which has led to health problems&nbsp;\u2014 and his pride. As a Gaulish chief, he prefers to travel on a [[shield]], carried by two shield bearers (they say pride comes before a fall... and he finds creative new ways to fall off the shield in almost every book). The names of the shield bearers are never mentioned.\n\nVitalstatistix fought at the [[battle of Alesia]] where Caesar (almost) completed his conquest of Gaul, before becoming chief of the village. In ''[[Asterix and the Chieftain's Shield]]'', it was revealed that the shield he is carried on originally belonged to the legendary Gaulish warrior chief [[Vercingetorix]].<ref>Asterix and the Chieftain's Shield, p. 5</ref> His father was the village chief before him. He has a brother, Doublehelix, in Lutetia who has a young daughter and a son, [[#Gauls|Justforkix]].\n\nThe introduction to each story states that Vitalstatistix has only one fear \"that the sky may fall on his head tomorrow\"; however, he rarely alludes to this in an actual story, and then only as a rallying cry: ''\"We have nothing to fear but ...\"''.  This characteristic is based on a real historical account where Gallic chieftains were asked by Alexander the Great what they were most afraid of in all the world, and replied that their worst fear was that the sky might fall on their heads.<ref>Arrian, Campaigns of Alexander, p. 49</ref>\n\nAlthough the chief of the village, his role in most plots is usually minor, commonly featuring him granting Asterix and Obelix permission to go on their latest missions, although he has shown a greater involvement in stories such as ''[[Asterix and the Big Fight]]'' when he had to battle a rival chieftain, ''[[Asterix and the Chieftain's Shield]]'' when he traveled to a health spa on Getafix's orders to cure a liver complaint and to lose weight, ''[[Asterix in Belgium]]'', where he traveled to Belgium to defend his honor when Caesar apparently proclaimed that the Belgians were the bravest of all the Gaulish peoples, or ''[[Asterix and Caesar's Gift]]'', where he ran against a new arrival in the village for the position of chief.\n\n* [[French language|French]]: ''Abraracourcix'' (''{{lang|fr|\u00e0 bras raccourcis}}''&nbsp;literally \u2014 \"with shortened arms\" from the French phrase ''{{lang|fr|tomber sur quelqu'un \u00e0 bras raccourcis}}'' \u2013 \"to attack someone with violence\")&nbsp;\u2014 this is the same in Italian, Portuguese, Spanish (also called Abrazopartidix in some editions) and (original) Dutch (although the \"o\" is usually dropped).\n*In [[English language|English]], his name is a pun on [[Vital statistics (government records)|Vital statistics]]&nbsp;\u2014 the government birth and death records of a region and also an expression for a person's measurements (a comment on [[BWH|his size]]). In the American translation, he was ''Macroeconomix'' from [[macroeconomics]]. NOTE: In the English version of the ''Asterix the Gaul'' film, he also appears to have been called ''Tonabrix'', and in the American dub of the ''Asterix and the Big Fight'' film he is called ''Bombastix''.\n*In Catalan, he is ''Copdegarr\u00f2tix''  (''{{lang|ca|cop de garrot}}''&nbsp;\u2014 \"club hit\").\n*In [[Croatian language|Croatian]] in 1990s, he is Vrhovnix, from {{lang|hr|vrh}} means \"supreme\" (vrhovni,najvi\u0161i) and -ix. ''Vrhovnik'' was attempted title for the supreme leader, i.e. state president's role as the constitutional leader of the national army. New translations from 2010s keep the same (anti)nationalist pun, calling the chief ''Samostalix'', from \"samostalan\", which means \"independent\" (as in \"independent and sovereign state\"), and actually alludes to first sentence of the constitution.\n*In [[German language|German]], Greek, [[Latin language|Latin]] and [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian]], he is ''Majestix'' from \"majestic\"; similarly in new Dutch translations he is ''Heroix'' from \"heroic\".\n* In [[Esperanto]], he is ''Mo\u015dtiks'' (''{{lang|eo|via mo\u015dto}}''&nbsp;\u2014 ''your highness'').\n*In [[Finnish language|Finnish]], he is ''Aladobix'', referring to ''{{lang|fi|aladobi}}'', a Finnish jelly-like dish containing meat (from the French ''{{lang|fr|\u00e0 la daube}}'').\n*In [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], he is ''Hasarengazfix'', which means \"His belly surely shakes\".\n*In [[Polish language|Polish]], he is ''Asparanoiks'', referring to [[paranoia]], the fear of the sky falling on his head.\n*In Turkish, ''Toptoriks'', alluding to his roundness (''top'' meaning ball in Turkish).\n*In Brazilian Portuguese, his name is usually shortened to ''Abracurcix''.\n*In Hindi translation, his name is mentioned as \u092e\u0941\u0916\u093f\u092f\u093e \u092e\u094b\u091f\u0941\u092e\u093e\u0932\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0938 (''Mukhiya Motumallix''), which literally means 'The Fat Chief'.\n*In [[Bengali language|Bengali]], the chief has a name phonetically similar to some extent to his English one: ''Bishalakritix'' (\u09ac\u09bf\u09b6\u09be\u09b2\u09be\u0995\u09c3\u09a4\u09bf\u0995\u09cd\u09b8), taken from the root ''bishalakriti'', which aptly means \"of huge proportions\".\n*In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], his name is \u05dc\u05d5\u05d7\u05de\u05d0\u05de\u05d9\u05e7\u05e1 (''lokhem-amix''), meaning \"brave warrior\".\n*In [[Serbian language|Serbian]], he is \u0414\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0441 (''Drmatoriks''), from ''{{lang|sr|drmator}}'', a slang term for Communist era movers and shakers (''{{lang|sr|drmati}}'' means \"to shake\"). Also in certain translations is known as \u0422\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0441 (''Tandarabriks'')\n*In [[Welsh Language|Welsh]], he is ''Einharweinix'', from ''ein harweinydd'' (our leader).\n*In [[Greek language|Greek]] film variations he was called \u03a7\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03be (''Khontrobalix''), from \u03c7\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03c2 (''khontrobal\u00e1s'', dubbing a man \"fat ball\"), but is currently referred to as \u039c\u03b1\u03b6\u03b5\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03be (''Mazestix'', from French ''{{lang|fr|majestueux}}'': \"majestic\"). He was also formerly called \u039c\u03bf\u03bd\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03af\u03be (''Monarchix'') from the word \u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03ac\u03c1\u03c7\u03b7\u03c2 (''mon\u00e1rch\u0113s'': \"monarch\") but the name changed in the later book translations after 1991.\n*In [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]&nbsp;\u2014 {{lang|si|\u0dc3\u0dd2\u0d82\u0dc4\u0dbd}} ({{transl|si|Loku Pappa}}) which means big or head/leader.\n*In [[Slovene language|Slovene]], he is ''Ataaufbix''. ''{{lang|sv|Ata}}'' means \"dad\" or \"father\" and ''{{lang|sv|aufbiks}}'' is a folk invitation to a fight.\n*In [[Romanian language|Romanian]], he is ''Bra\u021bscurtarix''.<ref>http://www.asterix-obelix.nl/index.php?page=hjh/voorstellen.inc&lng=ro</ref> ''{{lang|ro|bra\u021b}}'' meaning \"arm\" and ''{{lang|ro|scurt}}'' meaning \"short\".\n*In [[Russian language|Russian]], he is ''\u0416\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0441'' (Zhiznestatistiks). \"\u0416\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044c\" means \"life\", and \"\u0421\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0430\" means \"statistics\". In the \"Asterix: The Mansions of the Gods\" the chief is named \"\u0410\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0441\" (Avtoritarix). In the \"Asterix & Obelix Take on Caesar\" he is named \"\u0410\u0431\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0441\" (broken version of the French name).\n*In [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], he is ''\u041d\u0430\u0439\u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0441'' (Naidobrix), derived from \"\u043d\u0430\u0439-\u0434\u043e\u0431\u044a\u0440\", simply meaning \"the best one\".\n*In [[Czech language|Czech]], he is ''Majestatix'', derived from word ''Majest\u00e1tn\u00ed'' meaning majestic.\n*In Icelandic he is A\u00f0alr\u00edkur.\n\n====Chief's shieldbearers====\n\nFrom ''[[Asterix and Caesar's Gift]]'' onwards, Vitalstatistix has had the same (unnamed) bearers carry (and drop) him; prior to that, he had different bearers in each album. In ''[[Asterix in Switzerland]]'', he fires both his shield bearers after he tells them that it is a lovely day, and they look up, tipping the shield back and dropping the chief in the process. He then goes and hires new shield bearers including Asterix, Geriatrix, Fulliautomatix and Obelix (in these cases the shield is horribly tilted so he is forced to stand on a slant, and Obelix carried him with one hand like a waiter). The introduction page varies between showing the bearers straining under Vitalstatistix' not inconsiderable bulk as he looks into the distance in some of the books, while in others he looks at them in good humour as they look up to him in respect.\n\n====Impedimenta====\n\n:First appearance: ''[[Asterix and the Big Fight]]'' (but not named until ''[[Asterix and the Chieftain's Shield]]'').\nImpedimenta is the matriarchal wife of [[#Vitalstatistix|chief Vitalstatistix]], leader of the village wives and the best cook in the village. She is often disappointed with the other villagers (calling them barbarians) and wishes Vitalstatistix was more ambitious. Consequently, she zealously defends and flaunts every privilege due to her as first lady of the village, such as skipping the queue at the fishmongers. She frequently says she wants to go back to [[Lutetia]] and live with her successful merchant brother, [[#Gauls|Homeopathix]] \u2014 the one member of the family her husband openly dislikes.\n\nShe nicknamed Vitalstatistix \"Piggywiggy\" when they were courting, and starts doing this again in ''[[Asterix and the Soothsayer]]'' as a plan to make Asterix and Obelix erupt in hysterical laughter when she calls him by that name in front of them, thus irritating him and making him punish them by forcing them to stay in the village, away from the soothsayer.<ref>''[[Asterix and the Soothsayer]]'', p. 15</ref>\n\nOn occasion she has an antagonistic rivalry with Mrs. Geriatrix that has erupted into violence.  One such occasion was in ''[[Asterix and the Magic Carpet]]'' where the two beat each other with fish from Unhygenix's store over the fakir Watziznehm's carpet.\n\nWhile usually presented in the books as a nag to her embarrassed husband, she has on occasion fought the Romans side by side with the men, typically using her rolling pin as a weapon.  In emergencies, she's famous for remaining in control, as in [[Asterix and Son]] where during a Roman attack she fearlessly led the women and children out of the burning village.\n\nHer name appears to derive either from the Latin military term \"impedimenta,\" meaning \"baggage,\" or from the English word \"impediment,\" meaning obstruction or hindrance.\n\n*In [[French language|French]]: ''Bonnemine'' (''{{lang|fr|bonne mine}}'', meaning \"good countenance\", derived from the French expression \"faire bonne mine\" for \"putting on a brave face\") \u2014 also used in Swedish or Esperanto; chief Abraracourcix calls her ''Mimine''.\n*In [[Greek language|Greek]]: ''Bonemina'' \u2014 and sometimes \"Mimina\" \n*In [[English language|English]], the name is derived from ''[[wiktionary:impediment|impediment]]'', an obstacle, but possibly also a reference to the Latin ''impedimenta'', meaning ''baggage''; (in the American translations: ''Belladonna'' \u2014 a poisonous plant used in cosmetics whose name means ''beautiful lady'').\n*In [[Italian language|Italian]], she is ''Beniamina'', more often \"Mimina\".\n*In Spanish, she is ''Karabella '' (meaning \"beautiful face\").\n*In Portuguese, she is called Bonemine in some stories and Caralinda in others (Portuguese ''{{lang|pt|cara linda}}'', \"beautiful face\").\n*In the Brazilian translation she is ''[[naphthalene|Naftalina]]''.\n*In [[Dutch language|Dutch]], she is ''Bellefleur'' (a name for a type of red apple; \"beautiful flower\" in French).\n*In [[German language|German]], she is ''Gutemine''; Danish and Norwegian, ''Godemine'', presumably from the old saying ''{{lang|de|Gute Miene zum b\u00f6sen Spiel machen}}'' (German), ''{{lang|da|At holde gode miner til slet spil}}'' (Danish): \"To keep up appearances in the face of bad deeds\", literally: \"To show a happy face along a bad game\"), and mirroring the French ''{{lang|fr|bonne mine}}''.\n*In [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], she is ''Hengerlice''; which means \"tumbler pigeon\", a pun on her being a little fat.\n*In Turkish, she is ''Dedi\u011fimdediks''. ''{{lang|tr|Dedi\u011fim dedik}}'' refers to someone who insists on getting their way.\n*In [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], she is ''A\u00f0albj\u00f6rg'' (an ancient Icelandic name which means \"noble female protector\").\n*In [[Finnish language|Finnish]], she is ''Smirgeline'' (a pun on the Finnish word ''{{lang|fi|smirgeli}}'' meaning both \"emery\" and \"bench grinder\", by way of the Finnish [[dysphemism]] for a \"shrew\" being a grinder)\n*In [[Polish language|Polish]], she is ''Dobromina'' (most likely a pun on the Polish saying ''{{lang|pl|robi\u0107 dobr\u0105 min\u0119 do z\u0142ej gry}}'', which has the same meaning as the German/Danish/Norwegian translation above, and the [[old Polish]] female given name ''Dobromira'' (\"the one who values goodness and peace\") or ''Dobromi\u0142a'' (\"the one who is good and nice\").\n*In Catalan, she is sometimes called ''Bonemina'', but more usually ''Karabella''.\n*In Hindi, she is referred to as \u092a\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0930\u0940 \u0938\u093f\u0930\u0926\u0930\u094d\u0926\u093e (''Pyari Sirdarda''), the beloved, who causes Headache.\n*In Hebrew, she is called \u05d6\u05d9\u05d5\u05e4\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd (''Zivpanim''), meaning \"bright face\".\n*In [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]: {{lang|si|\u0dbd\u0ddc\u0d9a\u0dd4 \u0dc4\u0dcf\u0db8\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dda}} ({{transl|si|loku hamine}})\n*In [[Serbian language|Serbian]], she is ''Bombona'', literally meaning \"candy\", but also something lovely and well-arranged.\n*In [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], she is ''\u0414\u0443\u0448\u043e\u043c\u043e\u044f'' (Dushomoya). \"\u0414\u0443\u0448\u043e \u043c\u043e\u044f\" is a common pet name in Bulgaria used by husbands when addressing their wives (usually with older couples). Literally translates as \"my soul\".\n*In [[Czech language|Czech]], she is ''Bledul\u00edna'' meaning \"pale skinned\".\n*In the new [[Scots language|Scots]] translations, she is ''Boniquine'' meaning \"beautiful woman\".\n\n===Cacofonix===\n\nCacofonix is the village bard. He is usually only a supporting character, but has a major part in the plots of some albums (see ''[[Asterix and the Normans]]'', ''[[Asterix the Gladiator]]'', ''[[Asterix and the Magic Carpet]]'', ''[[The Mansions of the Gods]]'', and ''[[Asterix and the Secret Weapon]]''). He loves singing and playing his [[lyre]], and jumps at every opportunity to do so. He also plays the [[bagpipes]], [[drum]] and a Celtic [[trumpet]] resembling a boar called a [[Carnyx]]. While he can accompany traditional dances, and conducts a village band, his singing is unbearable. In ''[[Asterix and the Normans]]'' it is so unbearable that it teaches the fearless Normans the meaning of fear. In later albums his music is so spectacularly horrible that it actually starts thunderstorms (even indoors), because of an old French saying that bad singing causes rain.\n\nFor his part, Cacofonix considers himself a genius and a superb singer, and he is angrily offended when people criticize his singing, to the point of dismissing them as barbarians. He is slightly effeminate, often seen smoothing back his hair and holding his head up high.\n\nSome villagers go to extreme lengths to avoid hearing Cacofonix's music. Most notably, Fulliautomatix, the village smith, bangs him on the head at the merest hint of breaking into a song, and has destroyed his lyre on a number of occasions, at one point being called the \"ancestor of music critics\". As a [[running gag]], Cacofonix is generally tied up and gagged during the banquet at the end of most albums to allow the other villagers to have a good time without having to keep him from singing. He is nonetheless well liked when not singing.\n\nIn contrast to the villagers, some of the younger generations whom Cacofonix has met do appreciate his \"talent\": Justforkix (in ''[[Asterix and the Normans]]'') actually encouraged Cacofonix to think seriously about moving to [[Lutetia]] where he claimed the bard's way with music would be enjoyed; Pepe (in ''[[Asterix in Spain]]'') liked it because it reminded him of home (the goats bleating in his village); and Princess Orinjade (in ''[[Asterix and the Magic Carpet]]'') expressed similar enthusiasm, though it was perhaps in gratitude for his music having saved her from being sacrificed. Similarly, the village youths express a liking for his unconventional music in ''[[Asterix and the Chieftain's Daughter]]''.\n\nUnlike the other villagers, whose [[hut (dwelling)|hut]]s are on the ground, Cacofonix's hut is perched up in a tree. Ostensibly this is so that he can act as a lookout to warn the other villagers of imminent invasion, but the real reason is to let him practise his music as far from everyone as possible. It has been felled several times, often by Obelix, but has been replanted, or restored by Getafix's magic acorns (in ''[[The Mansions of the Gods]]'').\n\nIn the English and American adaptations of the series, he speaks in an effeminate voice.\n\nIn the animated ''Asterix and the Big Fight'', Cacofonix is seen playing a rock song trying to restore Getafix's memory, one occasion where Fulliautomatix and Unhygienix are not annoyed or angry with him.\n\nHe and Getafix are the village's teachers, as only bards and druids are allowed to teach in school. He is rarely seen fighting the Romans (not even joining fish-fights that often) except when his personal honour is impugned and appear to be more [[Pacifism|\npacifistic]] than the rest of the villagers. His voice apparently does not mix well with the magic potion, although in ''[[Asterix and the Magic Carpet]]'' it actually restores him to full voice.  The fact that he is incredibly arrogant may also be partly to blame, as in at least one volume (''[[Asterix and the Roman Agent]]'') he is shown to have not even noticed the other villagers are fighting the Romans and is actually shown asking Getafix what's going on (however, he had been suffering from a lost voice earlier in this volume and may have simply been staying in his hut while waiting to recover). In ''[[Asterix and the Missing Scroll]]'' it is revealed that he is the second stage of the village's 'emergency measure' if they are attacked while Getafix is absent; the first stage involves a secret supply of potion in the chief's hut, while the second stage involves Cacofonix blowing on a very loud horn to set up a signal to alert Getafix to danger, Vitalstatistix noting that this is the main reason the village still puts up with Cacofonix.\n\n* [[French language|French]]: ''Assurancetourix'' (''{{lang|fr|Assurance tous risques}}'' meaning \"comprehensive insurance\") \u2013 also in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (''Asuranceturix''), [[Catalan language|Catalan]] (''Asseguran\u00e7at\u00f3rix''), [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and original [[Dutch language|Dutch]] translations.\n*In [[English language|English]] and [[Romanian language|Romanian]]<ref>http://www.asterix-obelix.nl/index.php?page=hjh/voorstellen.inc&lng=ro</ref> ''Cacofonix'' is derived from [[cacophony|cacophonic]] (describing \"harsh and unpleasant sounds\"), from Greek \u03ba\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 (''kakos'', meaning \"bad\") and \u03c6\u03c9\u03bd\u03ae (''phon\u0113'', meaning \"voice\"). In the American version of the series, he was called ''Malacoustix'', which refers to \"bad acoustics\". In the English dub of the film ''Asterix the Gaul'' he is called ''Stopthemusix'' (a pun on the phrase \"stop the music\") and in the American dub of the ''Asterix and the Big Fight'' film he is called ''Franksinatrix'' (a pun on [[Frank Sinatra]]).\n*In [[Greek language|Greek]] he is \u039a\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c6\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03be (''Kakofonix'') and similarly ''Kakofonix, Kakofoniks'' in Polish, Turkish and in new Dutch translations.\n*In [[Serbian language|Serbian]], his name is \u0422\u0430\u043c\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0441 (''Tamburiks''). The name comes from [[Tambura (instrument)|tambura]], a very popular instrument in [[Serbia]]. ''Tamburati'' (\"to play tambura\") is Serbian slang meaning \"to beat someone up\". At the end of many albums, ''Tamburiks'' often gets beaten up, gagged and tied to a tree.\n*In [[Croatian language|Croatian]], his name is Tamburix. The name comes from [[Tambura (instrument)|tambura]], a very popular instrument in [[Croatia]].\n*In [[German language|German]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]], he is ''Troubadix''; in [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]] ''Trubadurix'', and in [[Czech Language|Czech]] ''Trubadix''. These are puns on \"[[troubadour]]\", a word for \"bard\".\n*In the [[Brazilian Portuguese]] translation he is ''Chatotorix'' (meaning \"annoying\" or \"the very dull one\").\n*In [[Hindi language|Hindi]], he is \u0917\u0935\u0948\u092f\u093e\u0901 \u092c\u0947\u0938\u0941\u0930\u0940\u0915\u094d\u0938 (''Gavaiya\u00f1 Besurix'') meaning \"one who sings out of tune\".\n*In [[Bengali language|Bengali]], this bard is known as ''Kawlorobix'' (\u0995\u09b2\u09b0\u09ac\u09bf\u0995\u09cd\u09b8) \u2013 the root being ''{{lang|bn-Latn|kawlorob}}'' \u2013 meaning \"making a lot of noise for no purpose\"\n*In [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] translation he is ''Hangjanix'', which means \"He absolutely has no voice\".\n*Similarly, the [[Esperanto]] name ''Malmuziks'' means \"the contrary of music\".\n*In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], \u05d7\u05de\u05e9\u05d9\u05e8\u05d9\u05e7\u05e1 (''Khamshirix'') which can be literally translated back as ''Limerix'' (from \"[[Limerick (poetry)|limerick]]\").\n*In [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] he is ''\u00d3\u00f0r\u00edkur'', originally meaning \"rich in odes\" but can also be interpreted as \"rich in madness\". A music-making competition in one of Iceland's most prestigious pre-colleges is named in his honour.\n*In [[Welsh Language|Welsh]], he is ''Odlgymix'', from ''{{lang|cy|odl gymysg}}'' (\"mixed rhyme\", a metre of Welsh verse).\n*In [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]] he is {{lang|si|\u0dc3\u0dd2\u0d82\u0dc4\u0dbd}} ({{transl|si|Caco Pappa}}), similar to ''Cacofonix''.\n*In [[Latin Language|Latin]], he is ''Cantorix'', from ''{{lang|la|cantor}}'' \"singer\".\n*In [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], he is ''\u0412\u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435\u0437\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0441'' (Vsebezrix). Most likely derived from \"\u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0431\u0435\u0437 \u0440\u0438\u0441\u043a\", meaning \"always without risk\", which is somewhat close to his original French name, but it can also be interpreted as \"\u0432 \u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0441\u0438 \u0441\u0435 \u0432\u0437\u0438\u0440\u0430\", meaning \"looks into himself\", which might be a reference to him being an artist.\n*In [[Irish language|Irish]], his name is ''D\u00e1nd\u00edrix'' \u2013 [[D\u00e1n D\u00edreach]] is a style of Irish poetry designed to be accompanied by a harp.\n*In Scots, he is ''Magonaglix'' - after the notoriously incompetent Scottish poet William McGonagall.\n\n===Geriatrix===\n:First Appearance: ''[[Asterix the Gladiator]]''<ref>Asterix the Gladiator</ref> but first named in ''[[Asterix at the Olympic Games]]''\nGeriatrix is the oldest inhabitant of Asterix's village: he is mentioned as 93 years old in  ''[[Asterix at the Olympic Games]]'' (while drunk, he says he feels ten years younger, to which Asterix replies, \"Well, that makes you 83, and it's time you were in bed\"). Some translations make him no more than 80.\n\nAs an elder, Geriatrix demands respect (generally more than he is given). Nonetheless he dislikes being treated as old and will attack anyone who comments to that effect. In particular he often beats up the village blacksmith Fulliautomatix for refusing to fight back due to his age, and actually cries out to be attacked. Geriatrix is seen to sit on the village council at times, on the face of it an entitlement deriving from being the oldest in the community. An example is on p.&nbsp;11 of ''[[Asterix and the Cauldron]]'' where he sits with Vitalstatistix, Cacofonix and Getafix, in deciding on Asterix's punishment for having violated their honor code. In ''[[Asterix and the Roman Agent]]'' he acquires a club which he later uses to knock down ''[[The Mansions of the Gods]]''.\n\nGeriatrix is against foreigners who are not from his village. He is a veteran of the [[Battle of Gergovia]] and the [[Battle of Alesia]], and refers to them when excited (\"It'll be just like Gergovia all over!\") or distraught (\"It's just like Alesia all over again!\").\nHe has an eye for the young ladies and has a very young and beautiful wife (who appears to be in her twenties) of whom he is very possessive \u2014 particularly when Obelix is around.\n\nIn [[prequels]] such as ''[[How Obelix Fell into the Magic Potion When he was a Little Boy]]'', in which most of the characters are children and Vitalstatistix is a slim young man, Geriatrix, along with Getafix, is unchanged.\n* [[French language|French]]: ''Agecanonix'' (''{{lang|fr|\u00c2ge canonique}}'', meaning \"very old age\") (also in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], as well as ''Decanonix'' \u2014 from ''{{lang|pt|Decano}}'', \"dean\").\n*In [[English language|English]], the name comes from [[Geriatrics]], the branch of medicine dealing with old age. He is also known as ''Arthritix'' in the American translations.\n*In [[Greek language|Greek]], he is \u039c\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03be (''Mathousalix''), from \u039c\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1 (''[[Methuselah]]'').\n*In [[Spanish language|Spanish]], he is ''Edadepiedrix'' and ''Edatdep\u00e8drix'' in Catalan (meaning \"Stone Age\").\n*In [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and  [[North Germanic languages|the Scandinavian languages]], he is ''Senilix'' (from [[senile]]).\n*In [[Italian language|Italian]], he is ''Matusalemix'', from ''Matusalem'' ([[Methuselah]]), the biblical \"old man\", similarly in [[German language|German]], ''Methusalix'' and in [[Greek language|Greek]] he is \u039c\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03be (''Mathousalix''), formerly \u03a0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03be (''Palaiontologix'').\n* In [[Serbian language|Serbian]], he is \u0414\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043a\u0441 (''Dedoviks''), from Serbian ''{{lang|sr|deda}}'' (\"grandfather\").\n*In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], \u05de\u05ea\u05d5\u05e9\u05dc\u05d7\u05d9\u05e7\u05e1, \u05d0\u05e9\u05de\u05d0\u05d9\u05e7\u05e1, \u05e7\u05e9\u05d9\u05e9\u05e0\u05d9\u05e7\u05e1 (''Methushelakhix'', ''Ashmaix'' (Asterix at the Olympic Games), ''Kashishnix'' (Animated films)).\n*In [[Dutch language|Dutch]], he is ''Nestorix'' (after [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]]).\n*In [[Croatian language|Croatian]], he is Metuzalemix, from [[Methuselah]] and -ix.\n*In [[Esperanto]], he is ''Dojeniks'' (from ''{{lang|eo|dojeno}}'' \u2014 doyen, wise old man)\n*In [[Polish language|Polish]], he is ''Ramoliks'' (\"grumpy old man\") or ''D\u0142ugowieczniks'' (\"long living\").\n*In [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], he is ''Sokadikix'' (\"umpteenth decade\") or ''Tatix'' (from ''{{lang|hu|tata}}'', an informal way to address old men) or ''Rozogav\u00e9nix'' (\"rickety old\") or  ''Matuzs\u00e1lemix'' (Methuselah)\n*In the [[Brazilian Portuguese]] translation he is ''Veteranix''.\n*In the [[Hindi]] translation he is \u092c\u0941\u0921\u094d\u0922\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0938 (''Buddhix''), which means \"the old man\".\n*In [[Turkish language|Turkish]] he is ''Eskitopraks'' meaning \"old timer\".\n*In [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] he is ''Capeloyonix'' which loosely translates to \"old hunched man who is easily tired\". (Cape \u2013 pronounced as Chapeh: meaning tired; Loyo; meaning weak)\n*In [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], he is ''\u0421\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0441'' (Starix), from the word \"\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043a\", meaning \"old timer\" or \"old geezer\".\n*In [[Czech language|Czech]], he is ''Archaix'' based on word \"archaic\". In some cases he is called ''Kmetix'' based on word \"kme\u0165\" meaning very old man.\n\n====Mrs. Geriatrix====\n:First Appearance: ''[[Asterix and the Roman Agent]]''\nMrs. Geriatrix enjoys her husband's devotion and also her status as wife of the village's most senior inhabitant, which makes her one of the inner circle of village wives. Her youthful appearance suggests that she is less than half her husband's age; she is also a lot taller. Although as ambitious and gossip-prone as the other wives, she has also shown herself to be very quick-witted. She is an excellent seamstress but has Geriatrix do most of the housework. She rules her home and marriage, and regularly tells her husband what to do even in direct contradiction of his own stated opinions. She does seem to be happily married, however, and the only serious conflict in her marriage is her occasional apparent interest in [[Obelix]] which makes her husband insanely jealous. On one occasion, she is offered the magic potion. She does not appear to be interested and says that it's very fattening, while staring at Obelix. She appears to be in favour of women's rights, as shown in ''[[Asterix and the Secret Weapon]]''. She eagerly accepted the radical changes in the village that occurred in this story. She and Impedimenta cause a gigantic fight in \"[[Asterix and the Class Act#Mini Midi Maxi|Mini Midi Maxi]]\".\n\n* She has never been officially named and is always referred to by [[Mrs#Traditional usage|the local title for wife]] and the translation of her husband's name ([[Uderzo]] has stated she is partially based on his own wife and he wishes to retain an air of mystery). In ''[[Asterix and the Soothsayer]]'', Impedimenta appears to address her as ''Myopia'' (which, given her choice of spouse would be extremely appropriate), but, as explained in this page\u2019s note, this is an invocation to a Gaulish Goddess (of short-sightedness) thus a [[double entendre]].\n\n===Unhygienix===\n\n:First appearance: ''[[Asterix in Spain]]''\nUnhygienix is the village [[fishmonger]], as was his father Unhealthix before him (as seen in ''[[Asterix and the Class Act]]''). His fish do not come from the sea near the village even though he has a fishing boat; instead they are transported all the way from [[Paris|Lutetia]] (and from [[Marseilles|Massilia]] in the German translations) as he believes they are of finer quality. He does not notice their smell, but most of the other villagers do and a lot of fights are caused by his stale fish, as when the blacksmith Fulliautomatix says: \"Anyway, it [the fight] wouldn't have happened if they [the fish] were fresh!\" and then Unhygenix slaps him with his fish.\nHe regularly has fights about his fish with his friend [[#Fulliautomatix|Fulliautomatix]], the village blacksmith, which often escalate to involve most of the village. Fulliautomatix says the fish are stale, Unhygienix throws a fish at him, he throws it back, it hits someone else, etc., and the whole village gets into a fight. This rivalry is a family tradition \u2014 their fathers also fought, and their children are continuing it. Despite this, his catch phrase is a scream to his wife, \"Bacteria! Get the fish inside!\" or \"Save the sales!\", in fights on the village he doesn't want to enter (i.e. fights that are not about his fish), when villagers buy or steal his fish to fight with. \n* [[French language|French]]: ''Ordralfab\u00e9tix'' (''{{lang|fr|Ordre alphab\u00e9tique}}'', meaning \"alphabetical order\") \u2014 this is essentially the same in Spanish (Ordenalfab\u00e9tix), Portuguese, Catalan and Italian (''Ordinalfabetix''), as well as Hebrew (\u05dc\u05e4\u05d9\u05e1\u05d3\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc\u05e4\u05d0\u05d1\u05d8\u05d9\u05e7\u05e1, ''Lefisederalphabetix'')\n*In [[English language|English]], he is ''Unhygienix'' (\"unclean\" from \"[[hygiene|unhygienic]]\"), and in the American dub of ''Asterix and the Big Fight'', he is called Fishstix (from [[Fish finger|fish sticks]]).\n*In [[Croatian language|Croatian]], he is Abecedix from [[alphabet]] and -ix.\n*In [[Dutch language|Dutch]], he is ''Kostunrix'' (\"costs a riks\", ''{{lang|nl|riks}}'' being short for ''[[rijksdaalder]]'', 2\u00bd [[Dutch guilder|guilders]])\n*In [[German language|German]], he is ''Verleihnix''  (''{{lang|de|Verleih' nichts}}'' \u2014 \"(I) do not lend anything\", especially not fish because, as Bacteria puts it, people are so careless and return the fish in poor condition).\n*In [[Swedish language|Swedish]], he is ''Crabbofix'' (close to \"crab and fish\")\n*In [[Danish language|Danish]], he is ''H\u00f8rmetix'' (''{{lang|da|H\u00f8rme}}'' means \"to stink\")\n*In [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], he is ''Hermetix'' (''{{lang|no|Hermetikk}}'' refers to the food contained in [[hermetic seal|hermetic]] [[tin can]]s)\n*In [[Polish language|Polish]], he is ''Szykalfabetiks'' (\"alphabetical order\") or ''Ahigieniks'' (\"unhygienic\")\n*In [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], he is ''Messesaglix'' (\"stinks far\")\n*In [[Serbian language|Serbian]], he is \u0410\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043a\u0441 (''Aerobiks'') \u2014 a pun on the word \"[[aerobics]]\"\n*In [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], he is \"Ordenalfabetix\" (\"alphabetic order\")\n*In [[Esperanto]], his name is ''Fi\u015da\u0109iks'' [\"fishachix\"] (''{{lang|eo|fi\u015da\u0109o}}'' \u2014 ''rotten fish'')\n*In [[Hebrew]], his name is ''\u05d1\u05e1\u05d3\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc\u05e4\u05d1\u05ea\u05d9\u05e7\u05e1'' [\"beseder-alephbetix\"] meaning in lexicographical order.\n*In [[Finnish language|Finnish]], he is ''Amaryllix''.\n*In [[Greek language|Greek]], he is \u0391\u03bb\u03c6\u03b1\u03b2\u03b7\u03c4\u03af\u03be (''Alfav\u0113tix'') meaning \"alphabet\" \u2014 formerly \u039a\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03c6\u03b1\u03b2\u03b7\u03c4\u03af\u03be (''Katalfav\u0113tix'') meaning \"in alphabetical order\".\n*In [[Turkish language|Turkish]], he is ''Palamutiks''.

In addition to being a direct translation of the original French name, this could also be a reference to the first published Bulgarian schoolbook, which taught children the alphabet and featured a picture of a whale at the end of it, giving it the nickname \"The Fish Schoolbook\" (despite whales being mammals, not fish).\n*In [[Czech language|Czech]], he is ''Alfabetix'' based on English word \"alphabet\".\n*in [[Scots language|Scots]], he is ''Minginhaddix'', the play being ''mingin' haddocks''. ''Minging'' is a colloquialism used in various regions of the [[United Kingdom]] including [[Scotland]], meaning ''disgusting.'' \n*In [[Russian language|Russian]], he is ''\u0410\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0441'' based on \"Anti sanitation\".\n\n====Bacteria====\n\n:First appearance: ''[[Asterix in Spain]]''\nBacteria is the wife of Unhygienix. She is one of the inner circle of village wives. She is quiet and easy-going, but doesn't hesitate to say exactly what she thinks. She helps her husband run his shop, selling fish of dubious quality, and is unperturbed by the bizarre uses to which they are sometimes put. They have two sons (whose names have not been mentioned) \u2014 one with blonde hair in ''[[Asterix in Corsica]]'', and the other with red hair in ''[[Asterix and the Secret Weapon]]''.\nIn ''[[Asterix and Obelix's Birthday|Asterix and Obelix's Birthday: The Golden Book]]'' the blonde son is seen having taken over the shop but rather than to import the fish from Lutetia, he gets the fish he sells from the nearby sea. This displeases his father who fears that the \"good name of the shop will go to waste\" that way.\n\n* [[French language|French]]: ''I\u00e9losubmarine'' (a pun on \"[[Yellow Submarine (song)|Yellow Submarine]]\") \u2014 a variant of this is used in most translations.\n*In [[English language|English]], [[bacteria]] is the name for a [[biological kingdom|kingdom]] of microorganisms, some of which are responsible for various diseases, keeping the same unsanitary character as her husband's name.\n*In [[Dutch language|Dutch]], she is ''Forentientje'' (''{{lang|nl|voor een tientje}}'', \"for ten guilders\", matching the monetary theme of her husband's name).\n*In [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian]], she is ''Remouladine''. (After the dressing, [[remoulade]], popular in Scandinavia and often eaten along with fish.){{citation needed |date=June 2011 |reason=but her name is never used in Swedish!}}\n* In [[Polish language|Polish]] she is ''Jelousubmarina'', which is \"yellow submarine\" written according to Polish pronunciation and with a female ending. Similar in [[German language|German]]: Jellosubmarine.\n\n===Fulliautomatix===\nFulliautomatix is the village [[Smith (metalwork)|smith]]. His father, Semiautomatix, was the village smith before him. He is tall and [[wikt:robust|robust]], and very [[wikt:strong|strong]] \u2014 he is one of the strongest characters, perhaps second only to Obelix, and a bit of a ruffian, especially to Cacofonix. Fulliautomatix's first appearance was in the first volume, ''[[Asterix the Gaul]]'', where the [[ancient Rome|Roman]] spy was amazed that he used his fists to forge [[iron]]. However, he is subsequently shown using a normal [[hammer]] and is now rarely seen without one.\nA very different looking Fulliautomatix appeared in ''[[Asterix and the Banquet]]'' in which he and Obelix argue as to who should be entitled to punch the Roman that they are both engaged in hitting anyway.\n\nFulliautomatix often interacts with [[#Unhygienix|Unhygienix]], the fishmonger, with whom he has a friendly rivalry. Fulliautomatix claims the [[fish]] he sells are stale, and this often results in Unhygienix throwing a fish at his face, causing a fight (sometimes the other villagers join in just for fun).<ref>Asterix in Belgium</ref>\nFulliautomatix also takes great pleasure in abusing, breaking the lyre of [[#Cacofonix|Cacofonix]] the bard, threatening him and hitting him on the head at the merest hint of breaking into a song (the songs are so bad that the other villagers do not object) \u2014 this happens so frequently that Cacofonix only protests about it if he hadn't intended to sing in the first place (such as in ''[[Asterix and Cleopatra]]'', where it turned out Cacofonix just wanted to tell Fulliautomatix that he was standing on Cacofonix's toes, which Fulliautomatix was unaware of due to the current snow covering their feet). It has been stated that he is perhaps the ancestor of all music critics. On the other hand, he is occasionally beaten up with a cane by [[#Geriatrix|Geriatrix]] when he is provoked by some comment the smith makes. When this happens he will often take out his frustration on the nearest convenient bystander (Cacofonix for preference) on the grounds that he does not feel he can fight back against someone so old, which only helps to further incense the old man.\n\nFulliautomatix also has two unnamed children who have appeared in separate comics \u2014 a son with blond hair in ''[[Asterix in Corsica]]'', and a daughter with blonde hair in ''[[Asterix and the Secret Weapon]]''. In ''[[Asterix and the Great Divide]]'' he is shown as having an [[apprentice]], though it is not specified if he's a relative; some speculate that he is the young son grown to teenage years, while in ''[[Asterix and the Chieftain's Daughter]]'' a young man resembling him is introduced as his eldest son. In ''[[Asterix and Obelix's Birthday|Asterix and Obelix's Birthday: The Golden Book]]'' Fulliautomatix is seen as an elderly man with his now adult son having taken over business; the scene begins with his son making steel dentures for Fulliautomatix, who has gone toothless over the years.\n\n* [[French language|French]]: ''C\u00e9tautomatix'' (''{{lang|fr|c'est automatique}}'', meaning \"it is automatic\") \u2014 the languages of Iberia follow fairly literally: ''Esautom\u00e1tix'' in Spanish, ''Esautom\u00e0tix'' in Catalan and ''Zetautomatix'' in Basque; in Portuguese ''Ceutautomatix'' or ''\u00c9automatix''.\n*In [[English language|English]], the name is a pun on \"fully automatic\"\n*In [[Croatian language|Croatian]], he is Poluautomatix means \"Semiautomatix\".\n*In [[German language|German]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] he is simply ''Automatix''.\n*In [[Greek language|Greek]] he is \u0391\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03be (''Automatix'').\n*In [[Polish language|Polish]], he is ''Automatiks'', or ''Tenautomatiks''.\n*In [[Czech language|Czech]], he is ''Automatix'', or ''Kovomatix'' where \"kovo\" means metallic.\n*In [[Esperanto]], his name is ''Tuta\u016dtomatiks''.\n*In [[Dutch language|Dutch]], he is ''Hoefnix'' \u2014 a double pun: ''{{lang|nl|hoef}}'' means \"hoof\" and the phrase ''{{lang|nl|ik hoef niks}}'' means \"I don't need/want anything\" referring to Unhygienix's fish.\n*In [[Brazilian Portuguese]], he is just ''Automatix.''\n*In [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Latin]], he is ''Armamix'' \u2014 in Latin, ''{{lang|la|armo}}'' means to provide arms, to equip with weapons.\n*In Icelandic versions, he is ''Ry\u00f0r\u00edkur''. Ironically, ''{{lang|is|Ry\u00f0}}'' means \"[[rust]]\" in Icelandic.\n*In [[Swedish language|Swedish]] versions, ''Smidefix'' (as a pun on the words \"smith\" and \"fix\")\n*In [[Turkish language|Turkish]], he is ''Tamotomatiks'', meaning \"fully automatic\".\n*In [[Finnish language|Finnish]], he is ''Caravellix'', possibly as a pun on the boat model Karaveli, meaning [[Caravel]].\n*In [[Serbian language|Serbian]], he is \u041c\u0435\u0442\u0430\u043b\u043e\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0441 (''Metaloplastiks''), as a pun on the words \"[[metal]]\" and \"[[plastics]]\", but also on the name of the famous [[team handball|handball]] team [[RK Metaloplastika|Metaloplastika]] from [[\u0160abac]]\n*In Hindi translation, he is \u092c\u0926\u092c\u094b\u0932\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0938 \u0932\u094b\u0939\u093e\u0924\u094b\u0921\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0938 (''Badbolix Lohatodix''), which means \"ill-spoken iron-breaker\"\n*In Hebrew, \u05e0\u05e9\u05e7\u05d0\u05d5\u05d8\u05d5\u05de\u05d0\u05d8\u05d9\u05e7\u05e1 (''Neshek-Otomatix'') means \"automatic weapon\".\n*In [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], he is ''\u0423\u0434\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0441'' (Udarnix), derived from \"\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0438\u043a\", which could translate as either \"hammer\" or \"striker\". \"\u0423\u0434\u0430\u0440\" by itself also means \"to hit\".\n\n====Mrs. Fulliautomatix====\n:First appearance: ''[[Asterix and the Roman Agent]]''\nMrs. Fulliautomatix is one of the inner circle of village wives. One of the shortest women in the village, and possessing of a steep and pointy nose, she takes no nonsense and dominates her much larger husband as well as getting into a brawl with the wife of Chief Vitalstatistix in ''[[Asterix and the Class Act]]''. Although she appears often, she has never been named in the stories. She has been known to beat up Cacofonix on occasion as well, in ''[[Asterix and the Secret Weapon]]''. She has a brother, as mentioned by her husband in ''[[Asterix and the Black Gold]]''.\n\n===Julius Caesar===\n:''Main article: [[Julius Caesar]]'' (historical)\nJulius Caesar (Jules C\u00e9sar) is the Roman dictator and conqueror of Gaul. Many of the stories involve his schemes to finally conquer this last Gaulish village holding out against his legions. At other times, the village has (indirectly) come to his aid, but more often it is a major embarrassment to him in the [[Roman senate]] \u2014 in at least one book, the entire senate is laughing at him after a failed plan. Despite this, Caesar is also shown to be a man of honour, since whenever Asterix and Obelix somehow end up helping Caesar, Caesar always grants them any favour they ask. He goes so far as to rebuild the entire Gaulish village when it was destroyed by [[Marcus Junius Brutus|Brutus]] who was trying to kidnap Caesar's son, whom Asterix returned safely to his family (''[[Asterix and Son]]''). The appearance of Caesar is based on portraits found on ancient Roman coins.\n\n===The Pirates===\n[[File:Redbeard vs asterix.jpg|thumb|180px|right|''Asterix'' parodies on the left, ''[[Redbeard (comics)|Barbe Rouge]]'' originals at right]]\n\nIn the course of their travels, Asterix and Obelix regularly cross paths with \u2014 and beat up \u2014 a group of [[pirate]]s. The Gauls then proceed to sink their ship, causing the pirates severe financial difficulties. The pirates make their first appearance in the fourth album (''[[Asterix the Gladiator]]''), and feature in almost every subsequent album.\n\nThe main pirates are based on the Belgian comic series ''[[Redbeard (comics)|Barbe Rouge]]'' (1959 and continuing). The adventures of Barbe Rouge (Redbeard) and his son Eric were published in ''[[Pilote]]'' magazine, where Asterix's adventures were also published prior to appearing in book form.\n\nAlthough Barbe Rouge is a popular character in his own right in continental Europe, the popularity of Asterix's pirates is one of the few occasions when parody figures have overshadowed their originals.\n\nOn one occasion (in ''[[Asterix the Legionary]]'') after the wreck the pirates were depicted in a scene similar to [[Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault]]'s ''[[Raft of the Medusa]]''. In the English version of this scene, the captain also refers to an ancient Gaulish artist called \"Jericho\", an alternative spelling of the name G\u00e9ricault.\n\nSuch is the fear that the pirates have for the Gauls that, having unknowingly taken them aboard\u2014Asterix and his companions boarded the ship in the night when it was too dark for either side to see the other properly, with the pirates only learning the truth when they sneaked into their guests' cabin to rob them\u2014they fled their own ship in the middle of the night while the subjects of their fear were sound asleep (''[[Asterix in Corsica]]''). At other times, it is Asterix and Obelix who have boarded the pirates' vessel and captured booty, thus reversing their roles of hunter and prey. This has happened mainly in the quest for food in an empty ocean (''[[Asterix in Spain]]''). On another occasion, Asterix and Obelix take all the food on the ship, leaving the pirates with a single sausage for the Captain's birthday; the pirates decide to look on the bright side and note that their ship didn't sink (''[[Asterix and the Great Crossing]]''). It happened again (in ''[[Asterix and the Magic Carpet]]'') with Asterix leaving a single coin for payment after Obelix threw all of their recently recovered treasure overboard while searching for food; the Captain told his depressed crew that it was better than nothing and that at least they still had the ship, but then their lookout proudly announced that he had upheld their honour and scuttled the ship himself. The other pirates were not impressed.\n\nThis \"honorable suicide-sinking\" has actually happened in earlier Asterix adventures, such as in ''[[Asterix and Cleopatra]]'' when the captain himself sank the ship after learning that the Gauls were on a nearby Egyptian vessel, reasoning that that would be the eventual outcome and doing it themselves would spare them a punch-up. Curiously enough, at the end of the same adventure, he and his crew were having to work as rowers aboard the very [[galley]] taking the Gauls back home and he announced with unusual determination that he will hunt them down and get his revenge. On another occasion, the pirates destroyed their ship simply at the sight of Asterix and all his fellow villagers in another vessel taking them to the [[Asterix at the Olympic Games|Olympic Games]]. In this event, though, the villagers did not attack since the captain of their ship announced that attacking the pirates would cost them extra. At the end of [[Asterix in Britain]], The captain, In a panic, orders his men to row as fast as they can in order to get away from Asterix and Obelix. Only for them to run aground on a beach. But the captain states that this is better than being sunk again.\n\nOn two occasions, Asterix also forced the Captain to spend all his hard-won loot on the merchandise of Ekonomikrisis the Phoenician merchant (''[[Asterix and the Black Gold]]''). On one occasion (''[[The Mansions of the Gods]]'') the Pirates appear on land, as part of the group of slaves (later freed) in the story. However, in one story so far\u2014''[[Asterix and the Cauldron]]''\u2014they end up happy for a change when a cauldron full of money that Asterix has been chasing throughout the story is tipped over a cliff and lands in their laps.\n\nThe main pirates are:\n* Redbeard (''Barbe Rouge'') \u2014 captain of the pirates.\n* Pegleg (''Triple Patte'') \u2014 an old pirate with a wooden leg who makes classical quotations in Latin.\n* {{anchor|Flaturtha}}<!-- \"Flaturtha\" redirects here. Please do not change the anchor unless you also change the redirect. TIA -->Pirate Lookout (''Baba'') \u2014 the [[Africa]]n pirate in the [[crow's nest]]. He also has a cousin who is a gladiator (see ''[[Asterix and the Cauldron]]''). In the original French and some other language versions he fails to pronounce the letters 'R' and 'L', leaving blanks in his speech. Early English translations also had him speaking something that resembled [[Jamaican Patois]] but this has been replaced by standard [[British English]] in re-editions, his manner of speaking no longer being a source of humour. He is sometimes confused with Flaturtha the Numidian, leader of the slaves in ''[[The Mansions of the Gods]]''. However, these are actually two separate characters;  Flaturtha has a different hairstyle, face shape, and physique.\n* Erix \u2014 the captain's son. Seen in ''[[Asterix and the Banquet]]'', he is mentioned in ''[[Asterix and Cleopatra]]'' as being left as a deposit on a new ship.\n\nIn addition a number of members of the pirate crew are [[sight gag]]s, some of whom have appeared on more than one occasion such as [[Frankenstein|Frankenstein's Monster]] and a [[Mongols|Mongol warrior]].\n\nIt should also be noted that in the films where the pirates are seen, Erix replaces Pegleg on the [[jetsam]] with Redbeard.\n\n==Minor recurring characters==\n:Original (''[[France|French]]'') name is given in parentheses when different.\n\n===Historical figures===\n\n[[File:Siege-alesia-vercingetorix-jules-cesar.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The surrender of [[Vercingetorix]] to Caesar, by [[Lionel-No\u00ebl Royer]].]]\n* [[Cleopatra VII of Egypt|Queen Cleopatra]] (''Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre'') \u2014 Queen of Egypt. Other characters often make remarks about her beautiful nose. She appears on the cover of ''[[Asterix and Cleopatra]]'', where Asterix, Obelix and Getafix are asked for aid from an Egyptian architect to build a palace in three months, as Cleopatra has a bet with Caesar to show the greatness of the Egyptians and has threatened to feed the architect to the [[crocodile]]s if he fails. She is also in ''[[Asterix and Son]]''\u2014where she sends her son by Caesar to Asterix for safekeeping as Brutus has tried to kill him\u2014and ''[[Asterix and Obelix All at Sea]]'', where she is in Rome with Caesar. In ''Asterix and Son'', she has fairer skin and a shorter, differently shaped nose, while in ''All At Sea'' she has darker skin than her first appearance and the smaller nose of her second appearance. Her appearance in the comic is seemingly based on [[Elizabeth Taylor]]'s screen depiction of the historical figure.\n* [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Brutus]] \u2014 Marcus Junius Brutus, Caesar's adopted son. Constantly plays with a knife, a reference to him being one of [[assassination of Julius Caesar|Caesar's assassins]] in real life. This is alluded to in ''[[Asterix and the Soothsayer]]'', where a [[Divination|soothsayer]] tells Caesar that if he keeps Brutus near he will come to no harm. The series includes numerous other references to the future assassination, such as Brutus muttering resentfully to himself, after being slighted by Caesar, \"one of these days I'll.....\" (''[[Asterix and the Roman Agent]]''), or, Caesar thinking to himself \"That Brutus... I can see I'm going to have trouble with him.\" (''[[Asterix the Gladiator]]'').  Caesar often uses the [[Shakespeare]]an quote: \"{{lang|la|[[Et tu, Brute?]]}}\" to him for various purposes. Brutus appears in minor roles in various books, and has a major role in ''[[Asterix and Son]]'', where his plot to kill Caesar and Cleopatra's infant son to secure his place as Caesar's heir prompts him to attack the village when Cleopatra sends her son there for safety, causing Caesar to send him to Upper [[Germania]]. Brutus's physical appearance is arguably different in each of his appearances.\n* [[Pompey]] (''Pomp\u00e9e'') \u2014 Caesar's greatest enemy and a former [[consul of Rome]]. He is mentioned in ''[[Asterix the Gladiator]]'', ''[[Asterix the Legionary]]'' and ''[[Asterix and the Roman Agent]]'' and appears in person in ''[[Asterix and the Actress]]'', where he is the book's antagonist, seeking valuable pieces of armour that have been given to Asterix and Obelix as birthday presents.\n* [[Metellus Scipio]] (''Scipion'') \u2014 Another of Caesar's enemies, allied to Pompey. Caesar defeated him in the [[Battle of Thapsus]], as depicted in ''[[Asterix the Legionary]]''. Note that Pompey doesn't make an appearance there, as he was assassinated before these events took place (though he anachronistically surfaces in ''[[Asterix and the Actress]]'' later).\n* [[Caesarion]] \u2014 Caesar and Cleopatra's baby boy. Appears in ''[[Asterix and Son]]'' where he is sent to the village for safety. He drinks the magic potion twice, causing trouble for the villagers and the Romans sent to capture him, but it has worn off by the end and he is reunited with his family. He shows a liking for sleeping under trees.\n* [[Spartacus]] \u2014 Gladiator and rebellion leader, resembling [[Kirk Douglas]] in ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]''. Appears in ''[[Asterix and Obelix All at Sea]]'' although in the album he is a Greek named ''Spartakis'', and is accompanied by a group of multi-national slaves after stealing Caesar's own galley. By the end the slaves have decided to stay in [[Atlantis]], and become children like most of the other inhabitants due to the magic of the Priest there.\n* [[Vercingetorix]] \u2014 [[Arverni]]an chieftain, who is shown as a historical figure surrendering Gaul in various books by throwing his arms ''on'' the feet of Caesar, which comically hurt Caesar's feet. His shield is at the centre of ''[[Asterix and the Chieftain's Shield]]'', and his fictional daughter Adrenalin in ''[[Asterix and the Chieftain's Daughter]]''.\n* [[Cassivellaunus]] \u2014 British chieftain who resists the Roman invasion.<ref>''Asterix in Britain'', p. 3</ref> Appears in ''[[Asterix in Britain]]''.\n\n===Villagers===\n* Monosyllabix and Polysyllabix (''Petit\u00e9l\u00e9grafix'') \u2014 Villagers that appear together, first in ''[[Obelix and Co.]]'', where they appear on the cover. They also appear in ''[[Asterix in Belgium]]'' and ''[[Asterix and the Secret Weapon]]''.\n* Obese lady \u2014 another of [[#Impedimenta|Impedimenta]]'s inner circle of village wives, however unlike the others her husband and name are unknown.\n* Soporifix (''Plantaquatix'') \u2014 father of Panacea who is mentioned in ''[[Asterix the Legionary]]'', but not seen until ''[[Asterix and the Actress]]''.\n*''Other villagers'' mentioned by name (and ''presumed'' to be recurring part of crowd scenes):\n**Operatix (''Boulimix''), Acoustix (''Aventur\u00e9pix''), Harmonix (''Allegorix''), Polyfonix (''Porquepix'') and Polytechnix (''El\u00e8vedelix'') in ''[[Asterix and the Normans]]''\n**Pacifix (''Linguistix''), Atlantix (''Arrierboutix''), Baltix (''Harenbaltix''), Adriatix (''Choucroutgarnix'') and Analgesix (''Analg\u00e9six'') in ''[[Obelix and Co.]]''\n**Bucolix (''D\u00e9bo\u00eetemendumenix'') and Photogenix (''Bellodalix'') in ''[[Asterix and Son]]'', and briefly in ''Obelix and Co.''<ref>Obelix and Co, p. 8</ref>\n**Tenansix (''C\u00e9tyounix'') in ''[[Asterix the Gaul]]'' \u2013 named for the old pre-1970s British monetary amount of 10\u00bd shillings (written as 10s6d or 10/6, spoken as 'Ten and Six'). [[Decimal Day|Decimalisation of UK currency]] didn't happen until early 1971, well after the first Asterix story was published.\n**[[Pick 'n' mix|Picanmix]] (''Keskonrix''), a youngster in ''[[Asterix the Gladiator]]''. Named for the method of buying confectionery from sweet shops in Britain. Also appears in Asterix and Cleopatra<ref>Asterix and Cleopatra p. 48</ref>\n**Pectine, a young girl, seen only in ''[[Asterix: The Secret of the Magic Potion]]''.  \n**Scarlatina (''Galantine'') in \"[[Asterix and the Class Act#For Gaul Lang Syne|For Gaul Lang Syne]]\"\n*Chanticleerix (''Chanteclairix'') \u2014 the village's [[rooster]].

In the front row are the main [[Gauls|Gaulish]] characters, plus [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Cleopatra]].]]\nThis is a list of characters in the ''[[Asterix]]'' comics.\n\n==Main characters==\nAsterix, Obelix and Dogmatix are the first characters with short descriptions usually listed at the beginning of each of the ''Asterix'' books (after the map of Gaul). They each have separate articles containing more information. Unless otherwise stated, this article uses the names chosen for the English translations of the books.\n\n===Asterix===\n{{Main|Asterix (character)}}\nAsterix is the main character. He is a brave, intelligent and shrewd warrior of somewhat diminutive size, who eagerly volunteers for all perilous missions.\n* {{lang-fr|Ast\u00e9rix}} (from ''{{lang|fr|ast\u00e9risque}}'', meaning \"[[asterisk]]\", which is the typographical symbol * indicating a footnote, from the Hellenic (Greek) word \u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1 (''aster''), meaning a \"star\"). As the titular character, he is usually the star of the story. His name is usually left unchanged in translations, aside from accents and the use of local [[alphabet]]s: for example, in [[Esperanto]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Slovene language|Slovene]], [[Latvian language|Latvian]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] it is ''Asteriks'', although in Turkish he was first named ''B\u00fcc\u00fcr'' meaning \"shorty\", but the name was then changed. \n*In [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], he is known as ''\u00c1str\u00edkur'' (\"Rich of love\").\n*In [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]], {{lang|si|\u0dc3\u0dd2\u0d82\u0dc4\u0dbd}} ({{transl|si|Soora Pappa}}) could be interpreted as 'heroic grandfather'.\n\n===Obelix===\n{{Main|Obelix}}\nObelix is Asterix's closest friend and works as a [[menhir]] sculptor and delivery man. He is a tall, [[obese]] man (he refers to himself as \"well-padded\" or \"man with a slipped chest\" and will immediately knock out anyone who calls him \"fat\") with two notable attributes: his permanently phenomenal strength and his voracious appetite for food, especially [[wild boar]]. His strength results from having fallen into Getafix's magic potion cauldron as a baby. As a consequence, Getafix will not let him take additional potion for fear of side effects (for example, turning into stone, as shown in ''Asterix and Obelix all at Sea''), something that Obelix finds immensely unfair. The only exception was in ''Asterix and Cleopatra'' when they were trapped in a [[pyramid]] and Getafix allows him to have three drops of the magic potion. Obelix's size is often the brunt of many jokes. In ''Asterix and the Big Fight'', a druid mistakes Obelix for a patient with an [[eating disorder]]. At the end of the book, Obelix decides to go on a diet, but quickly goes back to eating huge quantities of boar.\n\n* [[French language|French]]: ''Ob\u00e9lix'': meaning either ''ob\u00e9lisque'' \"[[obelisk]]\", a massive monument, or the [[dagger (typography)|typographical symbol]] (<big>\u2020</big>) (also called an ''obelus'' in English) which is sometimes used to indicate a second footnote if the first footnote is indicated by an asterisk. His name is also almost never changed in official translations (not counting orthographical variations such as ''Obeliks'' in e.g. [[Esperanto]], [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Slovene language|Slovene]]). Obelix can also mean \"man of the boars\" since the Hellenic (Greek) word \u039f\u03b2\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 (Obelias/Ovelias) means pig or boar.\n* In Icelandic, his name is ''Steinr\u00edkur'', roughly meaning \"rich in stone\", due to Obelix's fascination with stones.\n* Early [[Turkish Language|Turkish]] editions called him ''Hopdediks'', after ''{{lang|tr|Hop dedik!}}'', which is a phrase uttered when someone overdoes something. In more recent albums he is ''Oburiks'', after ''{{lang|tr|obur}}'', which means \"gluttonous\".\n\n===Dogmatix===\n\n{{Main|Dogmatix}}\n\n:First appearance: ''[[Asterix and the Banquet]]'' (book 5 in France), page 8.\nDogmatix is Obelix's pet dog. Unlike his immense master, Dogmatix is very tiny, but he can have a nasty temper. Dogmatix loves nature and hates to see trees suffer. (Obelix once mentions that this is because Dogmatix likes to urinate on them.) Dogmatix met Asterix and Obelix in Lutetia (in ''Asterix and the Banquet'') and followed them all the way around Gaul until Obelix finally noticed him when they reached the village and Dogmatix barked behind him. Since then, Obelix has become very affectionate toward Dogmatix. In ''[[Asterix and the Chieftain's Shield]]'', Obelix gets angry with hungry people who try to take Dogmatix's bone and insists they will be punished if they try to take advantage of his dog. Dogmatix is relatively intelligent, and is particularly good as a hunting dog.  His most noteworthy moments were rescuing Asterix, Obelix and Getafix from entrapment in ''[[Asterix and Cleopatra|Cleopatra]]'', finding the captured Asterix in ''[[Asterix and the Great Crossing|Great Crossing]]'', and locating the much needed desert petroleum in ''[[Asterix and the Black Gold|Black Gold]]''.\n\n* {{lang-fr|Id\u00e9fix}} (''{{lang|fr|id\u00e9e fixe}}'', a \"fixed idea\" or \"obsession\", also a \"prejudice\"). Most translations use some variant of this original name (e.g. ''Ideafix'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], ''Idefiks'' in [[Esperanto]] and [[Polish language|Polish]], and ''\u0130defiks'' in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]).\n*In [[Danish language|Danish]], [[German language|German]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Polish language|Polish]], ''Idefix''\n*In [[English language|English]], ''Dogmatix'' comes from ''[[dogma]]tic''&nbsp;\u2014 clinging to an unchanging set of beliefs. The pun is extended because the name also contains the word \"dog\".\n*[[Hindi language|Hindi]]&nbsp;\u2014 In the \u092e\u0927\u0941 \u092e\u0941\u0938\u094d\u0915\u093e\u0928 (''[[Madhu Muskan]]'') translations, Dogmatix has been called ''Kutta Bhaunkix'' (\"the dog who barks\")\n*In [[Bengali language|Bengali]], he is known as ''Gnoyartumix'' (\u0997\u09cb\u0981\u09af\u09bc\u09be\u09b0\u09cd\u09a4\u09c1\u09ae\u09bf\u0995\u09cd\u09b8)&nbsp;\u2014 compare the Bengali term ''{{lang|bn-Latn|gNyoyartumi}}'', which means \"being dogmatic\".\n*In [[Croatian language|Croatian]], he is known as ''Snupix'' (reference to Snoopy) and Fidofiks, and in newest translation as Malix (\"the little one\").\n*In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], \u05de\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05e7\u05e1 (''Mavrix'') means \"bright\".\n*In [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], it is ''Mirnixdirnix'' (quickly, immediately; a winged German loan word/expression), ''T\u00f6pszlix'' which refers to his small size, or ''Idefix'', ca. \"here for sure\" referring to fetching.\n*In [[Serbian language|Serbian]], it is \u0418\u0434\u0435\u0444\u0438\u043a\u0441 (''Idefiks''&nbsp;\u2014 directly taken from the French ''Id\u00e9fix'') or \u0413\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043a\u0441 (''Garoviks'', from ''{{lang|sr|garov}}'', a common name for a dog of indeterminable breed)\n*In [[Greek language|Greek]] early translations, he was called ''Katrulix'' (\u039a\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03af\u03be) meaning \"he who pees himself\".

Notes are given for languages which have translations of 90% or more of the albums&nbsp;\u2014 primarily European languages along with [[Brazilian Portuguese]]. ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] also falls in this category, but it leaves the French names unchanged. Languages which do not use the \"x\" (such as those of [[Eastern Europe]] like [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Baltic languages]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Esperanto]]) substitute \"ks\" in translations; \"c\" is also not used in some (such as Polish, Greek and Basque) which substitute \"k\" or \"z\" for hard and soft \"c\" respectively in names that are otherwise unaltered.\n\n===Getafix===\n[[File:Getafix the druid.jpg|right|thumb|175px|Asterix and Getafix]]\nGetafix is the village [[druid]]. In appearance, he is tall with a long white [[beard]], white robe, red cloak. He is usually seen in possession of a small golden [[sickle]]. While his age is never stated, in the story of Asterix's birth (in which all but the oldest villagers are seen as small children), he appears unchanged. In ''[[Asterix and the Big Fight]]'', the druid Psychoanalytix (who appears quite old) refers to him as his elder and teacher. In ''[[Asterix and Obelix's Birthday: The Golden Book]]'', as a gag, Getafix at 50 years older appears to be frail and old, while in the other books, he appeared healthy.\n\nAlthough known for his strength-enhancing magic potion, he has many other magical and medicinal potions at his disposal, including a potion to make hair grow quickly, a potion to counteract poison, one that neutralizes a drug that would kill in a matter of days, and a potion that restores a person to full health after injury (although this potion also causes the person who takes it to lose their recent memories while also interacting badly with the magic potion). Aside from making the potion, he also acts as the village doctor and occasional teacher. Asterix (and most other villagers) will consult him whenever anything strange occurs. He does not engage normally himself in combat, whereas most of the villagers enjoy a good punch-up (even with each other). One exception is one of the stories explaining Gaulish women, using Mrs. Geriatrix as an example, in which he involves himself in a fight sparked by Impedimenta. The final cut is shown with all the male villagers and two females, Impedimenta and Bacteria included, with Getafix running to stop the fight, with a piece of fish flying towards him. His most notable brawl is when, masquerading as a cook in ''[[Asterix and the Great Divide|The Great Divide]]'', he makes and partakes of the magic potion (passing it off as soup) to free the enslaved men from the divided village, captured by the Romans&nbsp;\u2014 and doing a test run on the slaves who were present&nbsp;\u2014 and then starts distributing slaps with obvious enjoyment.\n\nAs the only individual able to produce the \"magic potion\" upon which the villagers rely for their strength, he is the focus of many stories, ranging from the Romans attempting to put him out of commission in some manner to requesting that Asterix and Obelix help him find some missing ingredient, and the conscience of the village. On a few occasions, he has refused to make the potion when the villagers become too selfish, including in ''[[Asterix and Caesar's Gift]]'', where he refused to provide the potion for anyone while the village was divided by an upcoming vote for a new chief, only to provide them with it once again when Vitalstatistix asked Getafix to provide the potion for Orthopedix, the man he had been running against for chief. He has also occasionally been taken prisoner by hostile forces to get access to the potion, only to be freed again thanks to Asterix and Obelix. The full recipe of the magic potion itself has never been revealed, but known ingredients are mistletoe (which must be cut with a golden sickle [''[[Asterix and the Golden Sickle]]'']), a whole lobster (an optional ingredient that improves the flavour), fresh fish, salt, and petroleum (called rock oil in the book), which is later replaced by beetroot juice. Replenishing the stores of ingredients for the magic potion has led to some adventures for Asterix and Obelix, including ''[[Asterix and the Great Crossing]]'' and ''[[Asterix and the Black Gold]]''.\n\nGetafix is very similar to many [[wise old man|wise old men]] who act as mentors and father-figures to the heroes, such as [[Merlin]] or [[Gandalf]]. In the earlier books however, Getafix came across more as just a friend of the protagonists rather than a wise old counselor. He was also, from the very beginning, shown as a figure of fun and had a wonderful sense of humour: in ''[[Asterix the Gaul]]'', he keeps cutting his finger while using his [[sickle]] and roars with uncontrollable laughter at Asterix's teasing of the Roman Centurion; in ''[[Asterix and the Big Fight]]'', he was shown as going literally crazy; and he's not above making the occasional bad pun (such as in ''Asterix and the Great Divide'', when one of the village's frequent \"stale fish\" fights prompts him to observe that the villagers may soon discover nuclear \"fish-ion\").\n\n*[[French language|French]]: ''Panoramix'' (From Hellenic/Greek \u03a0\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03b1/Panorama which means wide view, \u03a0\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03af\u03be/Panoramix or \"he who sees everything\")&nbsp;\u2014 in most European translations this name is used, including [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Latin language|Latin]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Portuguese Language|Portuguese]], [[Slovene language|Slovene]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Spanish Language|Spanish]], [[Indonesian Language|Indonesian]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Greek language|Greek]], Asturian and [[Romanian language|Romanian]].\n*In [[English language|English]], the name is a pun on \"getting a fix\"&nbsp;\u2014 obtaining a dose of a recreational drug, and a reference to the magic potion he produces; the phrase can also mean to perceive or to get a solid sense of something. In the short-lived American version of the series, he was called ''Magigimmix'' (\"magic gimmicks\"). He was called ''[[RMC Group|Readymix]]'' (the name of a British cement firm) in newspaper comics during the 1970s, as ''Getafix'' was considered inappropriate for children. In the English version of the ''Asterix the Gaul'' film, he is referred to by his original French name of ''Panoramix'' and in the American dub of the ''Asterix and the Big Fight'' film he is called ''Vitamix''.\n*In [[German language|German]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], he is known as ''Miraculix'', from Latin ''miraculum'' (''miracle'').\n*In [[Serbian language|Serbian]], he is known as \u0410\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0441 (''Aspiriniks''), from the drug [[Aspirin]]. Also in certain translations is known as \u041f\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0438\u043a\u0441 (''Panoramiks'').\n*In [[Croatian language|Croatian]], he is known as ''\u010cudomiks'', from ''{{lang|hr|\u010dudo}}'' (\"miracle\") and ''{{lang|hr|miks}}'' (\"mix\"). In newest translation it is ''Faktorix''.\n*In [[Finnish language|Finnish]], he is ''Akvavitix'', from \"[[akvavit]]\", a [[Scandinavia]]n [[distilled beverage]] (derived from ''[[Aqua vitae]]'').\n*In [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]], his name is ''Crudemix'', \"Cruden\" being [[herbs]] and [[spices]], his name thus means \"Spice mix\".\n*In [[Esperanto]], he is ''Miraklomiks'', from ''{{lang|eo|miraklo}}'' (\"miracle\") and ''{{lang|eo|mikso}}'' (\"mix\")\n*In [[Hindi Language|Hindi]], he is \u0939\u0915\u0940\u092e \u0935\u0948\u0927\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0938 (''Hakeem Vaidhix''), Hindi for a \"village doctor\".\n*In [[Hungarian Language|Hungarian]], he is ''Magicoturmix'', which is a composition of \"magic\" and \"shake\", thus meaning \"Shake of Magic\". Actually, this is a reference to the potion he is brewing, which gives the villagers their wondrous superhuman strength.\n*In [[Bengali language|Bengali]], he is ''Etashetamix'' (\u098f\u099f\u09be\u09b8\u09c7\u099f\u09be\u09ae\u09bf\u0995\u09cd\u09b8), meaning \"mix this and that\".\n*In [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], he is ''Sj\u00f3\u00f0r\u00edkur'', roughly meaning \"one who boils\". In comparison, Asterix is ''\u00c1str\u00edkur'', \"one who loves\".\n*In [[Hebrew Language|Hebrew]], \u05d0\u05e9\u05e4\u05d9\u05e7\u05e1 (''Ashafix''), meaning \"master of the craft\".\n*In [[Welsh Language|Welsh]], he is ''Crycymalix'', a pun on the phrase ''{{lang|cy|cryd cymalau}}'', which means \"arthritis\" or \"rheumatism\", referring to his old age.\n*In [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]&nbsp;\u2014 {{lang|si|\u0dc3\u0dd2\u0d82\u0dc4\u0dbd}} ({{transl|si|Vedha Pappa}}) which means a \"[[druid]]\" or \"[[witch]]\".\n*In Malaysia, the English version that was released in the newspapers, he was \"Medix\" due to the strict laws in the country against drug abuse.\n*In [[Russian Language|Russian]], he is ''\u041f\u043e\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0441'' (''Pochinix''), meaning \"he who repairs things\". The name was translated from the English version, not the French, but the pun about \"getting a fix\" was lost in translation. However, the druid is named \"\u041f\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0438\u043a\u0441\" (\"Panoramix\") in all live-action films and Asterix: The Mansions of the Gods.\n*In [[Scots language|Scots]], he is named ''Kensawthetrix'', meaning \"knows all the tricks\".\n\n===Vitalstatistix===\n\nChief Vitalstatistix is the chief of the [[Gaul]]ish village. He is a middle-aged, bigbellied man with red hair, [[pigtail]]s and a huge [[moustache]]. He is generally reasonable, well-informed, fearless, (comparatively) even-tempered and unambitious&nbsp;\u2014 the last much to the chagrin of his wife [[#Impedimenta|Impedimenta]]. His major failings are his love of good food and drink (it is unlikely to be a coincidence that his wife is the best cook in the village)&nbsp;\u2014 which has led to health problems&nbsp;\u2014 and his pride. As a Gaulish chief, he prefers to travel on a [[shield]], carried by two shield bearers (they say pride comes before a fall... and he finds creative new ways to fall off the shield in almost every book). The names of the shield bearers are never mentioned.\n\nVitalstatistix fought at the [[battle of Alesia]] where Caesar (almost) completed his conquest of Gaul, before becoming chief of the village. In ''[[Asterix and the Chieftain's Shield]]'', it was revealed that the shield he is carried on originally belonged to the legendary Gaulish warrior chief [[Vercingetorix]].<ref>Asterix and the Chieftain's Shield, p. 5</ref> His father was the village chief before him. He has a brother, Doublehelix, in Lutetia who has a young daughter and a son, [[#Gauls|Justforkix]].\n\nThe introduction to each story states that Vitalstatistix has only one fear \"that the sky may fall on his head tomorrow\"; however, he rarely alludes to this in an actual story, and then only as a rallying cry: ''\"We have nothing to fear but ...\"''.  This characteristic is based on a real historical account where Gallic chieftains were asked by Alexander the Great what they were most afraid of in all the world, and replied that their worst fear was that the sky might fall on their heads.<ref>Arrian, Campaigns of Alexander, p. 49</ref>\n\nAlthough the chief of the village, his role in most plots is usually minor, commonly featuring him granting Asterix and Obelix permission to go on their latest missions, although he has shown a greater involvement in stories such as ''[[Asterix and the Big Fight]]'' when he had to battle a rival chieftain, ''[[Asterix and the Chieftain's Shield]]'' when he traveled to a health spa on Getafix's orders to cure a liver complaint and to lose weight, ''[[Asterix in Belgium]]'', where he traveled to Belgium to defend his honor when Caesar apparently proclaimed that the Belgians were the bravest of all the Gaulish peoples, or ''[[Asterix and Caesar's Gift]]'', where he ran against a new arrival in the village for the position of chief.\n\n* [[French language|French]]: ''Abraracourcix'' (''{{lang|fr|\u00e0 bras raccourcis}}''&nbsp;literally \u2014 \"with shortened arms\" from the French phrase ''{{lang|fr|tomber sur quelqu'un \u00e0 bras raccourcis}}'' \u2013 \"to attack someone with violence\")&nbsp;\u2014 this is the same in Italian, Portuguese, Spanish (also called Abrazopartidix in some editions) and (original) Dutch (although the \"o\" is usually dropped).\n*In [[English language|English]], his name is a pun on [[Vital statistics (government records)|Vital statistics]]&nbsp;\u2014 the government birth and death records of a region and also an expression for a person's measurements (a comment on [[BWH|his size]]). In the American translation, he was ''Macroeconomix'' from [[macroeconomics]]. NOTE: In the English version of the ''Asterix the Gaul'' film, he also appears to have been called ''Tonabrix'', and in the American dub of the ''Asterix and the Big Fight'' film he is called ''Bombastix''.\n*In Catalan, he is ''Copdegarr\u00f2tix''  (''{{lang|ca|cop de garrot}}''&nbsp;\u2014 \"club hit\").\n*In [[Croatian language|Croatian]], He is Vrhovnix, from {{lang|hr|vrh}} means \"supreme\" (vrhovni,najvi\u0161i) and -ix.\n*In [[German language|German]], Greek, [[Latin language|Latin]] and [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian]], he is ''Majestix'' from \"majestic\"; similarly in new Dutch translations he is ''Heroix'' from \"heroic\".\n* In [[Esperanto]], he is ''Mo\u015dtiks'' (''{{lang|eo|via mo\u015dto}}''&nbsp;\u2014 ''your highness'').\n*In [[Finnish language|Finnish]], he is ''Aladobix'', referring to ''{{lang|fi|aladobi}}'', a Finnish jelly-like dish containing meat (from the French ''{{lang|fr|\u00e0 la daube}}'').\n*In [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], he is ''Hasarengazfix'', which means \"His belly surely shakes\".\n*In [[Polish language|Polish]], he is ''Asparanoiks'', referring to [[paranoia]], the fear of the sky falling on his head.\n*In Turkish, ''Toptoriks'', alluding to his roundness (''top'' meaning ball in Turkish).\n*In Brazilian Portuguese, his name is usually shortened to ''Abracurcix''.\n*In Hindi translation, his name is mentioned as \u092e\u0941\u0916\u093f\u092f\u093e \u092e\u094b\u091f\u0941\u092e\u093e\u0932\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0938 (''Mukhiya Motumallix''), which literally means 'The Fat Chief'.\n*In [[Bengali language|Bengali]], the chief has a name phonetically similar to some extent to his English one: ''Bishalakritix'' (\u09ac\u09bf\u09b6\u09be\u09b2\u09be\u0995\u09c3\u09a4\u09bf\u0995\u09cd\u09b8), taken from the root ''bishalakriti'', which aptly means \"of huge proportions\".\n*In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], his name is \u05dc\u05d5\u05d7\u05de\u05d0\u05de\u05d9\u05e7\u05e1 (''lokhem-amix''), meaning \"brave warrior\".\n*In [[Serbian language|Serbian]], he is \u0414\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0441 (''Drmatoriks''), from ''{{lang|sr|drmator}}'', a slang term for Communist era movers and shakers (''{{lang|sr|drmati}}'' means \"to shake\"). Also in certain translations is known as \u0422\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0431\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0441 (''Tandarabriks'')\n*In [[Welsh Language|Welsh]], he is ''Einharweinix'', from ''ein harweinydd'' (our leader).\n*In [[Greek language|Greek]] film variations he was called \u03a7\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03be (''Khontrobalix''), from \u03c7\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03c2 (''khontrobal\u00e1s'', dubbing a man \"fat ball\"), but is currently referred to as \u039c\u03b1\u03b6\u03b5\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03be (''Mazestix'', from French ''{{lang|fr|majestueux}}'': \"majestic\"). He was also formerly called \u039c\u03bf\u03bd\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03af\u03be (''Monarchix'') from the word \u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03ac\u03c1\u03c7\u03b7\u03c2 (''mon\u00e1rch\u0113s'': \"monarch\") but the name changed in the later book translations after 1991.\n*In [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]&nbsp;\u2014 {{lang|si|\u0dc3\u0dd2\u0d82\u0dc4\u0dbd}} ({{transl|si|Loku Pappa}}) which means big or head/leader.\n*In [[Slovene language|Slovene]], he is ''Ataaufbix''. ''{{lang|sv|Ata}}'' means \"dad\" or \"father\" and ''{{lang|sv|aufbiks}}'' is a folk invitation to a fight.\n*In [[Romanian language|Romanian]], he is ''Bra\u021bscurtarix''.<ref>http://www.asterix-obelix.nl/index.php?page=hjh/voorstellen.inc&lng=ro</ref> ''{{lang|ro|bra\u021b}}'' meaning \"arm\" and ''{{lang|ro|scurt}}'' meaning \"short\".\n*In [[Russian language|Russian]], he is ''\u0416\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0441'' (Zhiznestatistiks). \"\u0416\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044c\" means \"life\", and \"\u0421\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0430\" means \"statistics\". In the \"Asterix: The Mansions of the Gods\" the chief is named \"\u0410\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0441\" (Avtoritarix). In the \"Asterix & Obelix Take on Caesar\" he is named \"\u0410\u0431\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0441\" (broken version of the French name).\n*In [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], he is ''\u041d\u0430\u0439\u0434\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0441'' (Naidobrix), derived from \"\u043d\u0430\u0439-\u0434\u043e\u0431\u044a\u0440\", simply meaning \"the best one\".\n*In [[Czech language|Czech]], he is ''Majestatix'', derived from word ''Majest\u00e1tn\u00ed'' meaning majestic.\n*In Icelandic he is A\u00f0alr\u00edkur.\n\n====Chief's shieldbearers====\n\nFrom ''[[Asterix and Caesar's Gift]]'' onwards, Vitalstatistix has had the same (unnamed) bearers carry (and drop) him; prior to that, he had different bearers in each album. In ''[[Asterix in Switzerland]]'', he fires both his shield bearers after he tells them that it is a lovely day, and they look up, tipping the shield back and dropping the chief in the process. He then goes and hires new shield bearers including Asterix, Geriatrix, Fulliautomatix and Obelix (in these cases the shield is horribly tilted so he is forced to stand on a slant, and Obelix carried him with one hand like a waiter). The introduction page varies between showing the bearers straining under Vitalstatistix' not inconsiderable bulk as he looks into the distance in some of the books, while in others he looks at them in good humour as they look up to him in respect.\n\n====Impedimenta====\n\n:First appearance: ''[[Asterix and the Big Fight]]'' (but not named until ''[[Asterix and the Chieftain's Shield]]'').\nImpedimenta is the matriarchal wife of [[#Vitalstatistix|chief Vitalstatistix]], leader of the village wives and the best cook in the village. She is often disappointed with the other villagers (calling them barbarians) and wishes Vitalstatistix was more ambitious. Consequently, she zealously defends and flaunts every privilege due to her as first lady of the village, such as skipping the queue at the fishmongers. She frequently says she wants to go back to [[Lutetia]] and live with her successful merchant brother, [[#Gauls|Homeopathix]] \u2014 the one member of the family her husband openly dislikes.\n\nShe nicknamed Vitalstatistix \"Piggywiggy\" when they were courting, and starts doing this again in ''[[Asterix and the Soothsayer]]'' as a plan to make Asterix and Obelix erupt in hysterical laughter when she calls him by that name in front of them, thus irritating him and making him punish them by forcing them to stay in the village, away from the soothsayer.<ref>''[[Asterix and the Soothsayer]]'', p. 15</ref>\n\nOn occasion she has an antagonistic rivalry with Mrs. Geriatrix that has erupted into violence.  One such occasion was in ''[[Asterix and the Magic Carpet]]'' where the two beat each other with fish from Unhygenix's store over the fakir Watziznehm's carpet.\n\nWhile usually presented in the books as a nag to her embarrassed husband, she has on occasion fought the Romans side by side with the men, typically using her rolling pin as a weapon.  In emergencies, she's famous for remaining in control, as in [[Asterix and Son]] where during a Roman attack she fearlessly led the women and children out of the burning village.\n\nHer name appears to derive either from the Latin military term \"impedimenta,\" meaning \"baggage,\" or from the English word \"impediment,\" meaning obstruction or hindrance.\n\n*In [[French language|French]]: ''Bonnemine'' (''{{lang|fr|bonne mine}}'', meaning \"good countenance\", derived from the French expression \"faire bonne mine\" for \"putting on a brave face\") \u2014 also used in Swedish or Esperanto; chief Abraracourcix calls her ''Mimine''.\n*In [[Greek language|Greek]]: ''Bonemina'' \u2014 and sometimes \"Mimina\" \n*In [[English language|English]], the name is derived from ''[[wiktionary:impediment|impediment]]'', an obstacle, but possibly also a reference to the Latin ''impedimenta'', meaning ''baggage''; (in the American translations: ''Belladonna'' \u2014 a poisonous plant used in cosmetics whose name means ''beautiful lady'').\n*In [[Italian language|Italian]], she is ''Beniamina'', more often \"Mimina\".\n*In Spanish, she is ''Karabella '' (meaning \"beautiful face\").\n*In Portuguese, she is called Bonemine in some stories and Caralinda in others (Portuguese ''{{lang|pt|cara linda}}'', \"beautiful face\").\n*In the Brazilian translation she is ''[[naphthalene|Naftalina]]''.\n*In [[Dutch language|Dutch]], she is ''Bellefleur'' (a name for a type of red apple; \"beautiful flower\" in French).\n*In [[German language|German]], she is ''Gutemine''; Danish and Norwegian, ''Godemine'', presumably from the old saying ''{{lang|de|Gute Miene zum b\u00f6sen Spiel machen}}'' (German), ''{{lang|da|At holde gode miner til slet spil}}'' (Danish): \"To keep up appearances in the face of bad deeds\", literally: \"To show a happy face along a bad game\"), and mirroring the French ''{{lang|fr|bonne mine}}''.\n*In [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], she is ''Hengerlice''; which means \"tumbler pigeon\", a pun on her being a little fat.\n*In Turkish, she is ''Dedi\u011fimdediks''. ''{{lang|tr|Dedi\u011fim dedik}}'' refers to someone who insists on getting their way.\n*In [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], she is ''A\u00f0albj\u00f6rg'' (an ancient Icelandic name which means \"noble female protector\").\n*In [[Finnish language|Finnish]], she is ''Smirgeline'' (a pun on the Finnish word ''{{lang|fi|smirgeli}}'' meaning both \"emery\" and \"bench grinder\", by way of the Finnish [[dysphemism]] for a \"shrew\" being a grinder)\n*In [[Polish language|Polish]], she is ''Dobromina'' (most likely a pun on the Polish saying ''{{lang|pl|robi\u0107 dobr\u0105 min\u0119 do z\u0142ej gry}}'', which has the same meaning as the German/Danish/Norwegian translation above, and the [[old Polish]] female given name ''Dobromira'' (\"the one who values goodness and peace\") or ''Dobromi\u0142a'' (\"the one who is good and nice\").\n*In Catalan, she is sometimes called ''Bonemina'', but more usually ''Karabella''.\n*In Hindi, she is referred to as \u092a\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0930\u0940 \u0938\u093f\u0930\u0926\u0930\u094d\u0926\u093e (''Pyari Sirdarda''), the beloved, who causes Headache.\n*In Hebrew, she is called \u05d6\u05d9\u05d5\u05e4\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd (''Zivpanim''), meaning \"bright face\".\n*In [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]: {{lang|si|\u0dbd\u0ddc\u0d9a\u0dd4 \u0dc4\u0dcf\u0db8\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dda}} ({{transl|si|loku hamine}})\n*In [[Serbian language|Serbian]], she is ''Bombona'', literally meaning \"candy\", but also something lovely and well-arranged.\n*In [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], she is ''\u0414\u0443\u0448\u043e\u043c\u043e\u044f'' (Dushomoya). \"\u0414\u0443\u0448\u043e \u043c\u043e\u044f\" is a common pet name in Bulgaria used by husbands when addressing their wives (usually with older couples). Literally translates as \"my soul\".\n*In [[Czech language|Czech]], she is ''Bledul\u00edna'' meaning \"pale skinned\".\n*In the new [[Scots language|Scots]] translations, she is ''Boniquine'' meaning \"beautiful woman\".\n\n===Cacofonix===\n\nCacofonix is the village bard. He is usually only a supporting character, but has a major part in the plots of some albums (see ''[[Asterix and the Normans]]'', ''[[Asterix the Gladiator]]'', ''[[Asterix and the Magic Carpet]]'', ''[[The Mansions of the Gods]]'', and ''[[Asterix and the Secret Weapon]]''). He loves singing and playing his [[lyre]], and jumps at every opportunity to do so. He also plays the [[bagpipes]], [[drum]] and a Celtic [[trumpet]] resembling a boar called a [[Carnyx]]. While he can accompany traditional dances, and conducts a village band, his singing is unbearable. In ''[[Asterix and the Normans]]'' it is so unbearable that it teaches the fearless Normans the meaning of fear. In later albums his music is so spectacularly horrible that it actually starts thunderstorms (even indoors), because of an old French saying that bad singing causes rain.\n\nFor his part, Cacofonix considers himself a genius and a superb singer, and he is angrily offended when people criticize his singing, to the point of dismissing them as barbarians. He is slightly effeminate, often seen smoothing back his hair and holding his head up high.\n\nSome villagers go to extreme lengths to avoid hearing Cacofonix's music. Most notably, Fulliautomatix, the village smith, bangs him on the head at the merest hint of breaking into a song, and has destroyed his lyre on a number of occasions, at one point being called the \"ancestor of music critics\". As a [[running gag]], Cacofonix is generally tied up and gagged during the banquet at the end of most albums to allow the other villagers to have a good time without having to keep him from singing. He is nonetheless well liked when not singing.\n\nIn contrast to the villagers, some of the younger generations whom Cacofonix has met do appreciate his \"talent\": Justforkix (in ''[[Asterix and the Normans]]'') actually encouraged Cacofonix to think seriously about moving to [[Lutetia]] where he claimed the bard's way with music would be enjoyed; Pepe (in ''[[Asterix in Spain]]'') liked it because it reminded him of home (the goats bleating in his village); and Princess Orinjade (in ''[[Asterix and the Magic Carpet]]'') expressed similar enthusiasm, though it was perhaps in gratitude for his music having saved her from being sacrificed. Similarly, the village youths express a liking for his unconventional music in ''[[Asterix and the Chieftain's Daughter]]''.\n\nUnlike the other villagers, whose [[hut (dwelling)|hut]]s are on the ground, Cacofonix's hut is perched up in a tree. Ostensibly this is so that he can act as a lookout to warn the other villagers of imminent invasion, but the real reason is to let him practise his music as far from everyone as possible. It has been felled several times, often by Obelix, but has been replanted, or restored by Getafix's magic acorns (in ''[[The Mansions of the Gods]]'').\n\nIn the English and American adaptations of the series, he speaks in an effeminate voice.\n\nIn the animated ''Asterix and the Big Fight'', Cacofonix is seen playing a rock song trying to restore Getafix's memory, one occasion where Fulliautomatix and Unhygienix are not annoyed or angry with him.\n\nHe and Getafix are the village's teachers, as only bards and druids are allowed to teach in school. He is rarely seen fighting the Romans (not even joining fish-fights that often) except when his personal honour is impugned and appear to be more [[Pacifism|\npacifistic]] than the rest of the villagers. His voice apparently does not mix well with the magic potion, although in ''[[Asterix and the Magic Carpet]]'' it actually restores him to full voice.  The fact that he is incredibly arrogant may also be partly to blame, as in at least one volume (''[[Asterix and the Roman Agent]]'') he is shown to have not even noticed the other villagers are fighting the Romans and is actually shown asking Getafix what's going on (however, he had been suffering from a lost voice earlier in this volume and may have simply been staying in his hut while waiting to recover). In ''[[Asterix and the Missing Scroll]]'' it is revealed that he is the second stage of the village's 'emergency measure' if they are attacked while Getafix is absent; the first stage involves a secret supply of potion in the chief's hut, while the second stage involves Cacofonix blowing on a very loud horn to set up a signal to alert Getafix to danger, Vitalstatistix noting that this is the main reason the village still puts up with Cacofonix.\n\n* [[French language|French]]: ''Assurancetourix'' (''{{lang|fr|Assurance tous risques}}'' meaning \"comprehensive insurance\") \u2013 also in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (''Asuranceturix''), [[Catalan language|Catalan]] (''Asseguran\u00e7at\u00f3rix''), [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and original [[Dutch language|Dutch]] translations.\n*In [[English language|English]] and [[Romanian language|Romanian]]<ref>http://www.asterix-obelix.nl/index.php?page=hjh/voorstellen.inc&lng=ro</ref> ''Cacofonix'' is derived from [[cacophony|cacophonic]] (describing \"harsh and unpleasant sounds\"), from Greek \u03ba\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 (''kakos'', meaning \"bad\") and \u03c6\u03c9\u03bd\u03ae (''phon\u0113'', meaning \"voice\"). In the American version of the series, he was called ''Malacoustix'', which refers to \"bad acoustics\". In the English dub of the film ''Asterix the Gaul'' he is called ''Stopthemusix'' (a pun on the phrase \"stop the music\") and in the American dub of the ''Asterix and the Big Fight'' film he is called ''Franksinatrix'' (a pun on [[Frank Sinatra]]).\n*In [[Greek language|Greek]] he is \u039a\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c6\u03c9\u03bd\u03af\u03be (''Kakofonix'') and similarly ''Kakofonix, Kakofoniks'' in Polish, Turkish and in new Dutch translations.\n*In [[Serbian language|Serbian]], his name is \u0422\u0430\u043c\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0441 (''Tamburiks''). The name comes from [[Tambura (instrument)|tambura]], a very popular instrument in [[Serbia]]. ''Tamburati'' (\"to play tambura\") is Serbian slang meaning \"to beat someone up\". At the end of many albums, ''Tamburiks'' often gets beaten up, gagged and tied to a tree.\n*In [[Croatian language|Croatian]], his name is Tamburix. The name comes from [[Tambura (instrument)|tambura]], a very popular instrument in [[Croatia]].\n*In [[German language|German]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]], he is ''Troubadix''; in [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]] ''Trubadurix'', and in [[Czech Language|Czech]] ''Trubadix''. These are puns on \"[[troubadour]]\", a word for \"bard\".\n*In the [[Brazilian Portuguese]] translation he is ''Chatotorix'' (meaning \"annoying\" or \"the very dull one\").\n*In [[Hindi language|Hindi]], he is \u0917\u0935\u0948\u092f\u093e\u0901 \u092c\u0947\u0938\u0941\u0930\u0940\u0915\u094d\u0938 (''Gavaiya\u00f1 Besurix'') meaning \"one who sings out of tune\".\n*In [[Bengali language|Bengali]], this bard is known as ''Kawlorobix'' (\u0995\u09b2\u09b0\u09ac\u09bf\u0995\u09cd\u09b8) \u2013 the root being ''{{lang|bn-Latn|kawlorob}}'' \u2013 meaning \"making a lot of noise for no purpose\"\n*In [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] translation he is ''Hangjanix'', which means \"He absolutely has no voice\".\n*Similarly, the [[Esperanto]] name ''Malmuziks'' means \"the contrary of music\".\n*In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], \u05d7\u05de\u05e9\u05d9\u05e8\u05d9\u05e7\u05e1 (''Khamshirix'') which can be literally translated back as ''Limerix'' (from \"[[Limerick (poetry)|limerick]]\").\n*In [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] he is ''\u00d3\u00f0r\u00edkur'', originally meaning \"rich in odes\" but can also be interpreted as \"rich in madness\". A music-making competition in one of Iceland's most prestigious pre-colleges is named in his honour.\n*In [[Welsh Language|Welsh]], he is ''Odlgymix'', from ''{{lang|cy|odl gymysg}}'' (\"mixed rhyme\", a metre of Welsh verse).\n*In [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]] he is {{lang|si|\u0dc3\u0dd2\u0d82\u0dc4\u0dbd}} ({{transl|si|Caco Pappa}}), similar to ''Cacofonix''.\n*In [[Latin Language|Latin]], he is ''Cantorix'', from ''{{lang|la|cantor}}'' \"singer\".\n*In [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], he is ''\u0412\u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435\u0437\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0441'' (Vsebezrix). Most likely derived from \"\u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0431\u0435\u0437 \u0440\u0438\u0441\u043a\", meaning \"always without risk\", which is somewhat close to his original French name, but it can also be interpreted as \"\u0432 \u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0441\u0438 \u0441\u0435 \u0432\u0437\u0438\u0440\u0430\", meaning \"looks into himself\", which might be a reference to him being an artist.\n*In [[Irish language|Irish]], his name is ''D\u00e1nd\u00edrix'' \u2013 [[D\u00e1n D\u00edreach]] is a style of Irish poetry designed to be accompanied by a harp.\n*In Scots, he is ''Magonaglix'' - after the notoriously incompetent Scottish poet William McGonagall.\n\n===Geriatrix===\n:First Appearance: ''[[Asterix the Gladiator]]''<ref>Asterix the Gladiator</ref> but first named in ''[[Asterix at the Olympic Games]]''\nGeriatrix is the oldest inhabitant of Asterix's village: he is mentioned as 93 years old in  ''[[Asterix at the Olympic Games]]'' (while drunk, he says he feels ten years younger, to which Asterix replies, \"Well, that makes you 83, and it's time you were in bed\"). Some translations make him no more than 80.\n\nAs an elder, Geriatrix demands respect (generally more than he is given). Nonetheless he dislikes being treated as old and will attack anyone who comments to that effect. In particular he often beats up the village blacksmith Fulliautomatix for refusing to fight back due to his age, and actually cries out to be attacked. Geriatrix is seen to sit on the village council at times, on the face of it an entitlement deriving from being the oldest in the community. An example is on p.&nbsp;11 of ''[[Asterix and the Cauldron]]'' where he sits with Vitalstatistix, Cacofonix and Getafix, in deciding on Asterix's punishment for having violated their honor code. In ''[[Asterix and the Roman Agent]]'' he acquires a club which he later uses to knock down ''[[The Mansions of the Gods]]''.\n\nGeriatrix is against foreigners who are not from his village. He is a veteran of the [[Battle of Gergovia]] and the [[Battle of Alesia]], and refers to them when excited (\"It'll be just like Gergovia all over!\") or distraught (\"It's just like Alesia all over again!\").\nHe has an eye for the young ladies and has a very young and beautiful wife (who appears to be in her twenties) of whom he is very possessive \u2014 particularly when Obelix is around.\n\nIn [[prequels]] such as ''[[How Obelix Fell into the Magic Potion When he was a Little Boy]]'', in which most of the characters are children and Vitalstatistix is a slim young man, Geriatrix, along with Getafix, is unchanged.\n* [[French language|French]]: ''Agecanonix'' (''{{lang|fr|\u00c2ge canonique}}'', meaning \"very old age\") (also in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], as well as ''Decanonix'' \u2014 from ''{{lang|pt|Decano}}'', \"dean\").\n*In [[English language|English]], the name comes from [[Geriatrics]], the branch of medicine dealing with old age. He is also known as ''Arthritix'' in the American translations.\n*In [[Greek language|Greek]], he is \u039c\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03be (''Mathousalix''), from \u039c\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1 (''[[Methuselah]]'').\n*In [[Spanish language|Spanish]], he is ''Edadepiedrix'' and ''Edatdep\u00e8drix'' in Catalan (meaning \"Stone Age\").\n*In [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and  [[North Germanic languages|the Scandinavian languages]], he is ''Senilix'' (from [[senile]]).\n*In [[Italian language|Italian]], he is ''Matusalemix'', from ''Matusalem'' ([[Methuselah]]), the biblical \"old man\", similarly in [[German language|German]], ''Methusalix'' and in [[Greek language|Greek]] he is \u039c\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03be (''Mathousalix''), formerly \u03a0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03be (''Palaiontologix'').\n* In [[Serbian language|Serbian]], he is \u0414\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043a\u0441 (''Dedoviks''), from Serbian ''{{lang|sr|deda}}'' (\"grandfather\").\n*In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], \u05de\u05ea\u05d5\u05e9\u05dc\u05d7\u05d9\u05e7\u05e1, \u05d0\u05e9\u05de\u05d0\u05d9\u05e7\u05e1, \u05e7\u05e9\u05d9\u05e9\u05e0\u05d9\u05e7\u05e1 (''Methushelakhix'', ''Ashmaix'' (Asterix at the Olympic Games), ''Kashishnix'' (Animated films)).\n*In [[Dutch language|Dutch]], he is ''Nestorix'' (after [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]]).\n*In [[Croatian language|Croatian]], he is Metuzalemix, from [[Methuselah]] and -ix.\n*In [[Esperanto]], he is ''Dojeniks'' (from ''{{lang|eo|dojeno}}'' \u2014 doyen, wise old man)\n*In [[Polish language|Polish]], he is ''Ramoliks'' (\"grumpy old man\") or ''D\u0142ugowieczniks'' (\"long living\").\n*In [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], he is ''Sokadikix'' (\"umpteenth decade\") or ''Tatix'' (from ''{{lang|hu|tata}}'', an informal way to address old men) or ''Rozogav\u00e9nix'' (\"rickety old\") or  ''Matuzs\u00e1lemix'' (Methuselah)\n*In the [[Brazilian Portuguese]] translation he is ''Veteranix''.\n*In the [[Hindi]] translation he is \u092c\u0941\u0921\u094d\u0922\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0938 (''Buddhix''), which means \"the old man\".\n*In [[Turkish language|Turkish]] he is ''Eskitopraks'' meaning \"old timer\".\n*In [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] he is ''Capeloyonix'' which loosely translates to \"old hunched man who is easily tired\". (Cape \u2013 pronounced as Chapeh: meaning tired; Loyo; meaning weak)\n*In [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], he is ''\u0421\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0441'' (Starix), from the word \"\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043a\", meaning \"old timer\" or \"old geezer\".\n*In [[Czech language|Czech]], he is ''Archaix'' based on word \"archaic\". In some cases he is called ''Kmetix'' based on word \"kme\u0165\" meaning very old man.\n\n====Mrs. Geriatrix====\n:First Appearance: ''[[Asterix and the Roman Agent]]''\nMrs. Geriatrix enjoys her husband's devotion and also her status as wife of the village's most senior inhabitant, which makes her one of the inner circle of village wives. Her youthful appearance suggests that she is less than half her husband's age; she is also a lot taller. Although as ambitious and gossip-prone as the other wives, she has also shown herself to be very quick-witted. She is an excellent seamstress but has Geriatrix do most of the housework. She rules her home and marriage, and regularly tells her husband what to do even in direct contradiction of his own stated opinions. She does seem to be happily married, however, and the only serious conflict in her marriage is her occasional apparent interest in [[Obelix]] which makes her husband insanely jealous. On one occasion, she is offered the magic potion. She does not appear to be interested and says that it's very fattening, while staring at Obelix. She appears to be in favour of women's rights, as shown in ''[[Asterix and the Secret Weapon]]''. She eagerly accepted the radical changes in the village that occurred in this story. She and Impedimenta cause a gigantic fight in \"[[Asterix and the Class Act#Mini Midi Maxi|Mini Midi Maxi]]\".\n\n* She has never been officially named and is always referred to by [[Mrs#Traditional usage|the local title for wife]] and the translation of her husband's name ([[Uderzo]] has stated she is partially based on his own wife and he wishes to retain an air of mystery). In ''[[Asterix and the Soothsayer]]'', Impedimenta appears to address her as ''Myopia'' (which, given her choice of spouse would be extremely appropriate), but, as explained in this page\u2019s note, this is an invocation to a Gaulish Goddess (of short-sightedness) thus a [[double entendre]].\n\n===Unhygienix===\n\n:First appearance: ''[[Asterix in Spain]]''\nUnhygienix is the village [[fishmonger]], as was his father Unhealthix before him (as seen in ''[[Asterix and the Class Act]]''). His fish do not come from the sea near the village even though he has a fishing boat; instead they are transported all the way from [[Paris|Lutetia]] (and from [[Marseilles|Massilia]] in the German translations) as he believes they are of finer quality. He does not notice their smell, but most of the other villagers do and a lot of fights are caused by his stale fish, as when the blacksmith Fulliautomatix says: \"Anyway, it [the fight] wouldn't have happened if they [the fish] were fresh!\" and then Unhygenix slaps him with his fish.\nHe regularly has fights about his fish with his friend [[#Fulliautomatix|Fulliautomatix]], the village blacksmith, which often escalate to involve most of the village. Fulliautomatix says the fish are stale, Unhygienix throws a fish at him, he throws it back, it hits someone else, etc., and the whole village gets into a fight. This rivalry is a family tradition \u2014 their fathers also fought, and their children are continuing it. Despite this, his catch phrase is a scream to his wife, \"Bacteria! Get the fish inside!\" or \"Save the sales!\", in fights on the village he doesn't want to enter (i.e. fights that are not about his fish), when villagers buy or steal his fish to fight with. \n* [[French language|French]]: ''Ordralfab\u00e9tix'' (''{{lang|fr|Ordre alphab\u00e9tique}}'', meaning \"alphabetical order\") \u2014 this is essentially the same in Spanish (Ordenalfab\u00e9tix), Portuguese, Catalan and Italian (''Ordinalfabetix''), as well as Hebrew (\u05dc\u05e4\u05d9\u05e1\u05d3\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc\u05e4\u05d0\u05d1\u05d8\u05d9\u05e7\u05e1, ''Lefisederalphabetix'')\n*In [[English language|English]], he is ''Unhygienix'' (\"unclean\" from \"[[hygiene|unhygienic]]\"), and in the American dub of ''Asterix and the Big Fight'', he is called Fishstix (from [[Fish finger|fish sticks]]).\n*In [[Croatian language|Croatian]], he is Abecedix from [[alphabet]] and -ix.\n*In [[Dutch language|Dutch]], he is ''Kostunrix'' (\"costs a riks\", ''{{lang|nl|riks}}'' being short for ''[[rijksdaalder]]'', 2\u00bd [[Dutch guilder|guilders]])\n*In [[German language|German]], he is ''Verleihnix''  (''{{lang|de|Verleih' nichts}}'' \u2014 \"(I) do not lend anything\", especially not fish because, as Bacteria puts it, people are so careless and return the fish in poor condition).\n*In [[Swedish language|Swedish]], he is ''Crabbofix'' (close to \"crab and fish\")\n*In [[Danish language|Danish]], he is ''H\u00f8rmetix'' (''{{lang|da|H\u00f8rme}}'' means \"to stink\")\n*In [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], he is ''Hermetix'' (''{{lang|no|Hermetikk}}'' refers to the food contained in [[hermetic seal|hermetic]] [[tin can]]s)\n*In [[Polish language|Polish]], he is ''Szykalfabetiks'' (\"alphabetical order\") or ''Ahigieniks'' (\"unhygienic\")\n*In [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], he is ''Messesaglix'' (\"stinks far\")\n*In [[Serbian language|Serbian]], he is \u0410\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043a\u0441 (''Aerobiks'') \u2014 a pun on the word \"[[aerobics]]\"\n*In [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], he is \"Ordenalfabetix\" (\"alphabetic order\")\n*In [[Esperanto]], his name is ''Fi\u015da\u0109iks'' [\"fishachix\"] (''{{lang|eo|fi\u015da\u0109o}}'' \u2014 ''rotten fish'')\n*In [[Hebrew]], his name is ''\u05d1\u05e1\u05d3\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc\u05e4\u05d1\u05ea\u05d9\u05e7\u05e1'' [\"beseder-alephbetix\"] meaning in lexicographical order.\n*In [[Finnish language|Finnish]], he is ''Amaryllix''.\n*In [[Greek language|Greek]], he is \u0391\u03bb\u03c6\u03b1\u03b2\u03b7\u03c4\u03af\u03be (''Alfav\u0113tix'') meaning \"alphabet\" \u2014 formerly \u039a\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03c6\u03b1\u03b2\u03b7\u03c4\u03af\u03be (''Katalfav\u0113tix'') meaning \"in alphabetical order\".\n*In [[Turkish language|Turkish]], he is ''Palamutiks''.

In addition to being a direct translation of the original French name, this could also be a reference to the first published Bulgarian schoolbook, which taught children the alphabet and featured a picture of a whale at the end of it, giving it the nickname \"The Fish Schoolbook\" (despite whales being mammals, not fish).\n*In [[Czech language|Czech]], he is ''Alfabetix'' based on English word \"alphabet\".\n*in [[Scots language|Scots]], he is ''Minginhaddix'', the play being ''mingin' haddocks''. ''Minging'' is a colloquialism used in various regions of the [[United Kingdom]] including [[Scotland]], meaning ''disgusting.'' \n*In [[Russian language|Russian]], he is ''\u0410\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0441'' based on \"Anti sanitation\".\n\n====Bacteria====\n\n:First appearance: ''[[Asterix in Spain]]''\nBacteria is the wife of Unhygienix. She is one of the inner circle of village wives. She is quiet and easy-going, but doesn't hesitate to say exactly what she thinks. She helps her husband run his shop, selling fish of dubious quality, and is unperturbed by the bizarre uses to which they are sometimes put. They have two sons (whose names have not been mentioned) \u2014 one with blonde hair in ''[[Asterix in Corsica]]'', and the other with red hair in ''[[Asterix and the Secret Weapon]]''.\nIn ''[[Asterix and Obelix's Birthday|Asterix and Obelix's Birthday: The Golden Book]]'' the blonde son is seen having taken over the shop but rather than to import the fish from Lutetia, he gets the fish he sells from the nearby sea. This displeases his father who fears that the \"good name of the shop will go to waste\" that way.\n\n* [[French language|French]]: ''I\u00e9losubmarine'' (a pun on \"[[Yellow Submarine (song)|Yellow Submarine]]\") \u2014 a variant of this is used in most translations.\n*In [[English language|English]], [[bacteria]] is the name for a [[biological kingdom|kingdom]] of microorganisms, some of which are responsible for various diseases, keeping the same unsanitary character as her husband's name.\n*In [[Dutch language|Dutch]], she is ''Forentientje'' (''{{lang|nl|voor een tientje}}'', \"for ten guilders\", matching the monetary theme of her husband's name).\n*In [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian]], she is ''Remouladine''. (After the dressing, [[remoulade]], popular in Scandinavia and often eaten along with fish.){{citation needed |date=June 2011 |reason=but her name is never used in Swedish!}}\n* In [[Polish language|Polish]] she is ''Jelousubmarina'', which is \"yellow submarine\" written according to Polish pronunciation and with a female ending. Similar in [[German language|German]]: Jellosubmarine.\n\n===Fulliautomatix===\nFulliautomatix is the village [[Smith (metalwork)|smith]]. His father, Semiautomatix, was the village smith before him. He is tall and [[wikt:robust|robust]], and very [[wikt:strong|strong]] \u2014 he is one of the strongest characters, perhaps second only to Obelix, and a bit of a ruffian, especially to Cacofonix. Fulliautomatix's first appearance was in the first volume, ''[[Asterix the Gaul]]'', where the [[ancient Rome|Roman]] spy was amazed that he used his fists to forge [[iron]]. However, he is subsequently shown using a normal [[hammer]] and is now rarely seen without one.\nA very different looking Fulliautomatix appeared in ''[[Asterix and the Banquet]]'' in which he and Obelix argue as to who should be entitled to punch the Roman that they are both engaged in hitting anyway.\n\nFulliautomatix often interacts with [[#Unhygienix|Unhygienix]], the fishmonger, with whom he has a friendly rivalry. Fulliautomatix claims the [[fish]] he sells are stale, and this often results in Unhygienix throwing a fish at his face, causing a fight (sometimes the other villagers join in just for fun).<ref>Asterix in Belgium</ref>\nFulliautomatix also takes great pleasure in abusing, breaking the lyre of [[#Cacofonix|Cacofonix]] the bard, threatening him and hitting him on the head at the merest hint of breaking into a song (the songs are so bad that the other villagers do not object) \u2014 this happens so frequently that Cacofonix only protests about it if he hadn't intended to sing in the first place (such as in ''[[Asterix and Cleopatra]]'', where it turned out Cacofonix just wanted to tell Fulliautomatix that he was standing on Cacofonix's toes, which Fulliautomatix was unaware of due to the current snow covering their feet). It has been stated that he is perhaps the ancestor of all music critics. On the other hand, he is occasionally beaten up with a cane by [[#Geriatrix|Geriatrix]] when he is provoked by some comment the smith makes. When this happens he will often take out his frustration on the nearest convenient bystander (Cacofonix for preference) on the grounds that he does not feel he can fight back against someone so old, which only helps to further incense the old man.\n\nFulliautomatix also has two unnamed children who have appeared in separate comics \u2014 a son with blond hair in ''[[Asterix in Corsica]]'', and a daughter with blonde hair in ''[[Asterix and the Secret Weapon]]''. In ''[[Asterix and the Great Divide]]'' he is shown as having an [[apprentice]], though it is not specified if he's a relative; some speculate that he is the young son grown to teenage years, while in ''[[Asterix and the Chieftain's Daughter]]'' a young man resembling him is introduced as his eldest son. In ''[[Asterix and Obelix's Birthday|Asterix and Obelix's Birthday: The Golden Book]]'' Fulliautomatix is seen as an elderly man with his now adult son having taken over business; the scene begins with his son making steel dentures for Fulliautomatix, who has gone toothless over the years.\n\n* [[French language|French]]: ''C\u00e9tautomatix'' (''{{lang|fr|c'est automatique}}'', meaning \"it is automatic\") \u2014 the languages of Iberia follow fairly literally: ''Esautom\u00e1tix'' in Spanish, ''Esautom\u00e0tix'' in Catalan and ''Zetautomatix'' in Basque; in Portuguese ''Ceutautomatix'' or ''\u00c9automatix''.\n*In [[English language|English]], the name is a pun on \"fully automatic\"\n*In [[Croatian language|Croatian]], he is Poluautomatix means \"Semiautomatix\".\n*In [[German language|German]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] he is simply ''Automatix''.\n*In [[Greek language|Greek]] he is \u0391\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03be (''Automatix'').\n*In [[Polish language|Polish]], he is ''Automatiks'', or ''Tenautomatiks''.\n*In [[Czech language|Czech]], he is ''Automatix'', or ''Kovomatix'' where \"kovo\" means metallic.\n*In [[Esperanto]], his name is ''Tuta\u016dtomatiks''.\n*In [[Dutch language|Dutch]], he is ''Hoefnix'' \u2014 a double pun: ''{{lang|nl|hoef}}'' means \"hoof\" and the phrase ''{{lang|nl|ik hoef niks}}'' means \"I don't need/want anything\" referring to Unhygienix's fish.\n*In [[Brazilian Portuguese]], he is just ''Automatix.''\n*In [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Latin]], he is ''Armamix'' \u2014 in Latin, ''{{lang|la|armo}}'' means to provide arms, to equip with weapons.\n*In Icelandic versions, he is ''Ry\u00f0r\u00edkur''. Ironically, ''{{lang|is|Ry\u00f0}}'' means \"[[rust]]\" in Icelandic.\n*In [[Swedish language|Swedish]] versions, ''Smidefix'' (as a pun on the words \"smith\" and \"fix\")\n*In [[Turkish language|Turkish]], he is ''Tamotomatiks'', meaning \"fully automatic\".\n*In [[Finnish language|Finnish]], he is ''Caravellix'', possibly as a pun on the boat model Karaveli, meaning [[Caravel]].\n*In [[Serbian language|Serbian]], he is \u041c\u0435\u0442\u0430\u043b\u043e\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0441 (''Metaloplastiks''), as a pun on the words \"[[metal]]\" and \"[[plastics]]\", but also on the name of the famous [[team handball|handball]] team [[RK Metaloplastika|Metaloplastika]] from [[\u0160abac]]\n*In Hindi translation, he is \u092c\u0926\u092c\u094b\u0932\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0938 \u0932\u094b\u0939\u093e\u0924\u094b\u0921\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0938 (''Badbolix Lohatodix''), which means \"ill-spoken iron-breaker\"\n*In Hebrew, \u05e0\u05e9\u05e7\u05d0\u05d5\u05d8\u05d5\u05de\u05d0\u05d8\u05d9\u05e7\u05e1 (''Neshek-Otomatix'') means \"automatic weapon\".\n*In [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], he is ''\u0423\u0434\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0441'' (Udarnix), derived from \"\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0438\u043a\", which could translate as either \"hammer\" or \"striker\". \"\u0423\u0434\u0430\u0440\" by itself also means \"to hit\".\n\n====Mrs. Fulliautomatix====\n:First appearance: ''[[Asterix and the Roman Agent]]''\nMrs. Fulliautomatix is one of the inner circle of village wives. One of the shortest women in the village, and possessing of a steep and pointy nose, she takes no nonsense and dominates her much larger husband as well as getting into a brawl with the wife of Chief Vitalstatistix in ''[[Asterix and the Class Act]]''. Although she appears often, she has never been named in the stories. She has been known to beat up Cacofonix on occasion as well, in ''[[Asterix and the Secret Weapon]]''. She has a brother, as mentioned by her husband in ''[[Asterix and the Black Gold]]''.\n\n===Julius Caesar===\n:''Main article: [[Julius Caesar]]'' (historical)\nJulius Caesar (Jules C\u00e9sar) is the Roman dictator and conqueror of Gaul. Many of the stories involve his schemes to finally conquer this last Gaulish village holding out against his legions. At other times, the village has (indirectly) come to his aid, but more often it is a major embarrassment to him in the [[Roman senate]] \u2014 in at least one book, the entire senate is laughing at him after a failed plan. Despite this, Caesar is also shown to be a man of honour, since whenever Asterix and Obelix somehow end up helping Caesar, Caesar always grants them any favour they ask. He goes so far as to rebuild the entire Gaulish village when it was destroyed by [[Marcus Junius Brutus|Brutus]] who was trying to kidnap Caesar's son, whom Asterix returned safely to his family (''[[Asterix and Son]]''). The appearance of Caesar is based on portraits found on ancient Roman coins.\n\n===The Pirates===\n[[File:Redbeard vs asterix.jpg|thumb|180px|right|''Asterix'' parodies on the left, ''[[Redbeard (comics)|Barbe Rouge]]'' originals at right]]\n\nIn the course of their travels, Asterix and Obelix regularly cross paths with \u2014 and beat up \u2014 a group of [[pirate]]s. The Gauls then proceed to sink their ship, causing the pirates severe financial difficulties. The pirates make their first appearance in the fourth album (''[[Asterix the Gladiator]]''), and feature in almost every subsequent album.\n\nThe main pirates are based on the Belgian comic series ''[[Redbeard (comics)|Barbe Rouge]]'' (1959 and continuing). The adventures of Barbe Rouge (Redbeard) and his son Eric were published in ''[[Pilote]]'' magazine, where Asterix's adventures were also published prior to appearing in book form.\n\nAlthough Barbe Rouge is a popular character in his own right in continental Europe, the popularity of Asterix's pirates is one of the few occasions when parody figures have overshadowed their originals.\n\nOn one occasion (in ''[[Asterix the Legionary]]'') after the wreck the pirates were depicted in a scene similar to [[Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault]]'s ''[[Raft of the Medusa]]''. In the English version of this scene, the captain also refers to an ancient Gaulish artist called \"Jericho\", an alternative spelling of the name G\u00e9ricault.\n\nSuch is the fear that the pirates have for the Gauls that, having unknowingly taken them aboard\u2014Asterix and his companions boarded the ship in the night when it was too dark for either side to see the other properly, with the pirates only learning the truth when they sneaked into their guests' cabin to rob them\u2014they fled their own ship in the middle of the night while the subjects of their fear were sound asleep (''[[Asterix in Corsica]]''). At other times, it is Asterix and Obelix who have boarded the pirates' vessel and captured booty, thus reversing their roles of hunter and prey. This has happened mainly in the quest for food in an empty ocean (''[[Asterix in Spain]]''). On another occasion, Asterix and Obelix take all the food on the ship, leaving the pirates with a single sausage for the Captain's birthday; the pirates decide to look on the bright side and note that their ship didn't sink (''[[Asterix and the Great Crossing]]''). It happened again (in ''[[Asterix and the Magic Carpet]]'') with Asterix leaving a single coin for payment after Obelix threw all of their recently recovered treasure overboard while searching for food; the Captain told his depressed crew that it was better than nothing and that at least they still had the ship, but then their lookout proudly announced that he had upheld their honour and scuttled the ship himself. The other pirates were not impressed.\n\nThis \"honorable suicide-sinking\" has actually happened in earlier Asterix adventures, such as in ''[[Asterix and Cleopatra]]'' when the captain himself sank the ship after learning that the Gauls were on a nearby Egyptian vessel, reasoning that that would be the eventual outcome and doing it themselves would spare them a punch-up. Curiously enough, at the end of the same adventure, he and his crew were having to work as rowers aboard the very [[galley]] taking the Gauls back home and he announced with unusual determination that he will hunt them down and get his revenge. On another occasion, the pirates destroyed their ship simply at the sight of Asterix and all his fellow villagers in another vessel taking them to the [[Asterix at the Olympic Games|Olympic Games]]. In this event, though, the villagers did not attack since the captain of their ship announced that attacking the pirates would cost them extra. At the end of [[Asterix in Britain]], The captain, In a panic, orders his men to row as fast as they can in order to get away from Asterix and Obelix. Only for them to run aground on a beach. But the captain states that this is better than being sunk again.\n\nOn two occasions, Asterix also forced the Captain to spend all his hard-won loot on the merchandise of Ekonomikrisis the Phoenician merchant (''[[Asterix and the Black Gold]]''). On one occasion (''[[The Mansions of the Gods]]'') the Pirates appear on land, as part of the group of slaves (later freed) in the story. However, in one story so far\u2014''[[Asterix and the Cauldron]]''\u2014they end up happy for a change when a cauldron full of money that Asterix has been chasing throughout the story is tipped over a cliff and lands in their laps.\n\nThe main pirates are:\n* Redbeard (''Barbe Rouge'') \u2014 captain of the pirates.\n* Pegleg (''Triple Patte'') \u2014 an old pirate with a wooden leg who makes classical quotations in Latin.\n* {{anchor|Flaturtha}}<!-- \"Flaturtha\" redirects here. Please do not change the anchor unless you also change the redirect. TIA -->Pirate Lookout (''Baba'') \u2014 the [[Africa]]n pirate in the [[crow's nest]]. He also has a cousin who is a gladiator (see ''[[Asterix and the Cauldron]]''). In the original French and some other language versions he fails to pronounce the letters 'R' and 'L', leaving blanks in his speech. Early English translations also had him speaking something that resembled [[Jamaican Patois]] but this has been replaced by standard [[British English]] in re-editions, his manner of speaking no longer being a source of humour. He is sometimes confused with Flaturtha the Numidian, leader of the slaves in ''[[The Mansions of the Gods]]''. However, these are actually two separate characters;  Flaturtha has a different hairstyle, face shape, and physique.\n* Erix \u2014 the captain's son. Seen in ''[[Asterix and the Banquet]]'', he is mentioned in ''[[Asterix and Cleopatra]]'' as being left as a deposit on a new ship.\n\nIn addition a number of members of the pirate crew are [[sight gag]]s, some of whom have appeared on more than one occasion such as [[Frankenstein|Frankenstein's Monster]] and a [[Mongols|Mongol warrior]].\n\nIt should also be noted that in the films where the pirates are seen, Erix replaces Pegleg on the [[jetsam]] with Redbeard.\n\n==Minor recurring characters==\n:Original (''[[France|French]]'') name is given in parentheses when different.\n\n===Historical figures===\n\n[[File:Siege-alesia-vercingetorix-jules-cesar.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The surrender of [[Vercingetorix]] to Caesar, by [[Lionel-No\u00ebl Royer]].]]\n* [[Cleopatra VII of Egypt|Queen Cleopatra]] (''Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre'') \u2014 Queen of Egypt. Other characters often make remarks about her beautiful nose. She appears on the cover of ''[[Asterix and Cleopatra]]'', where Asterix, Obelix and Getafix are asked for aid from an Egyptian architect to build a palace in three months, as Cleopatra has a bet with Caesar to show the greatness of the Egyptians and has threatened to feed the architect to the [[crocodile]]s if he fails. She is also in ''[[Asterix and Son]]''\u2014where she sends her son by Caesar to Asterix for safekeeping as Brutus has tried to kill him\u2014and ''[[Asterix and Obelix All at Sea]]'', where she is in Rome with Caesar. In ''Asterix and Son'', she has fairer skin and a shorter, differently shaped nose, while in ''All At Sea'' she has darker skin than her first appearance and the smaller nose of her second appearance. Her appearance in the comic is seemingly based on [[Elizabeth Taylor]]'s screen depiction of the historical figure.\n* [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Brutus]] \u2014 Marcus Junius Brutus, Caesar's adopted son. Constantly plays with a knife, a reference to him being one of [[assassination of Julius Caesar|Caesar's assassins]] in real life. This is alluded to in ''[[Asterix and the Soothsayer]]'', where a [[Divination|soothsayer]] tells Caesar that if he keeps Brutus near he will come to no harm. The series includes numerous other references to the future assassination, such as Brutus muttering resentfully to himself, after being slighted by Caesar, \"one of these days I'll.....\" (''[[Asterix and the Roman Agent]]''), or, Caesar thinking to himself \"That Brutus... I can see I'm going to have trouble with him.\" (''[[Asterix the Gladiator]]'').  Caesar often uses the [[Shakespeare]]an quote: \"{{lang|la|[[Et tu, Brute?]]}}\" to him for various purposes. Brutus appears in minor roles in various books, and has a major role in ''[[Asterix and Son]]'', where his plot to kill Caesar and Cleopatra's infant son to secure his place as Caesar's heir prompts him to attack the village when Cleopatra sends her son there for safety, causing Caesar to send him to Upper [[Germania]]. Brutus's physical appearance is arguably different in each of his appearances.\n* [[Pompey]] (''Pomp\u00e9e'') \u2014 Caesar's greatest enemy and a former [[consul of Rome]]. He is mentioned in ''[[Asterix the Gladiator]]'', ''[[Asterix the Legionary]]'' and ''[[Asterix and the Roman Agent]]'' and appears in person in ''[[Asterix and the Actress]]'', where he is the book's antagonist, seeking valuable pieces of armour that have been given to Asterix and Obelix as birthday presents.\n* [[Metellus Scipio]] (''Scipion'') \u2014 Another of Caesar's enemies, allied to Pompey. Caesar defeated him in the [[Battle of Thapsus]], as depicted in ''[[Asterix the Legionary]]''. Note that Pompey doesn't make an appearance there, as he was assassinated before these events took place (though he anachronistically surfaces in ''[[Asterix and the Actress]]'' later).\n* [[Caesarion]] \u2014 Caesar and Cleopatra's baby boy. Appears in ''[[Asterix and Son]]'' where he is sent to the village for safety. He drinks the magic potion twice, causing trouble for the villagers and the Romans sent to capture him, but it has worn off by the end and he is reunited with his family. He shows a liking for sleeping under trees.\n* [[Spartacus]] \u2014 Gladiator and rebellion leader, resembling [[Kirk Douglas]] in ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]''. Appears in ''[[Asterix and Obelix All at Sea]]'' although in the album he is a Greek named ''Spartakis'', and is accompanied by a group of multi-national slaves after stealing Caesar's own galley. By the end the slaves have decided to stay in [[Atlantis]], and become children like most of the other inhabitants due to the magic of the Priest there.\n* [[Vercingetorix]] \u2014 [[Arverni]]an chieftain, who is shown as a historical figure surrendering Gaul in various books by throwing his arms ''on'' the feet of Caesar, which comically hurt Caesar's feet. His shield is at the centre of ''[[Asterix and the Chieftain's Shield]]'', and his fictional daughter Adrenalin in ''[[Asterix and the Chieftain's Daughter]]''.\n* [[Cassivellaunus]] \u2014 British chieftain who resists the Roman invasion.<ref>''Asterix in Britain'', p. 3</ref> Appears in ''[[Asterix in Britain]]''.\n\n===Villagers===\n* Monosyllabix and Polysyllabix (''Petit\u00e9l\u00e9grafix'') \u2014 Villagers that appear together, first in ''[[Obelix and Co.]]'', where they appear on the cover. They also appear in ''[[Asterix in Belgium]]'' and ''[[Asterix and the Secret Weapon]]''.\n* Obese lady \u2014 another of [[#Impedimenta|Impedimenta]]'s inner circle of village wives, however unlike the others her husband and name are unknown.\n* Soporifix (''Plantaquatix'') \u2014 father of Panacea who is mentioned in ''[[Asterix the Legionary]]'', but not seen until ''[[Asterix and the Actress]]''.\n*''Other villagers'' mentioned by name (and ''presumed'' to be recurring part of crowd scenes):\n**Operatix (''Boulimix''), Acoustix (''Aventur\u00e9pix''), Harmonix (''Allegorix''), Polyfonix (''Porquepix'') and Polytechnix (''El\u00e8vedelix'') in ''[[Asterix and the Normans]]''\n**Pacifix (''Linguistix''), Atlantix (''Arrierboutix''), Baltix (''Harenbaltix''), Adriatix (''Choucroutgarnix'') and Analgesix (''Analg\u00e9six'') in ''[[Obelix and Co.]]''\n**Bucolix (''D\u00e9bo\u00eetemendumenix'') and Photogenix (''Bellodalix'') in ''[[Asterix and Son]]'', and briefly in ''Obelix and Co.''<ref>Obelix and Co, p. 8</ref>\n**Tenansix (''C\u00e9tyounix'') in ''[[Asterix the Gaul]]'' \u2013 named for the old pre-1970s British monetary amount of 10\u00bd shillings (written as 10s6d or 10/6, spoken as 'Ten and Six'). [[Decimal Day|Decimalisation of UK currency]] didn't happen until early 1971, well after the first Asterix story was published.\n**[[Pick 'n' mix|Picanmix]] (''Keskonrix''), a youngster in ''[[Asterix the Gladiator]]''. Named for the method of buying confectionery from sweet shops in Britain. Also appears in Asterix and Cleopatra<ref>Asterix and Cleopatra p. 48</ref>\n**Pectine, a young girl, seen only in ''[[Asterix: The Secret of the Magic Potion]]''.  \n**Scarlatina (''Galantine'') in \"[[Asterix and the Class Act#For Gaul Lang Syne|For Gaul Lang Syne]]\"\n*Chanticleerix (''Chanteclairix'') \u2014 the village's [[rooster]].
