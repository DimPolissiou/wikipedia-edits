He debuted in the now-non-canonical ''[[Star Wars Holiday Special]]'' (1978), as an antagonist to the main characters in the programme's animated segment. In ''[[The Empire Strikes Back|Episode V \u2013 The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980), he is hired by [[Darth Vader]] to capture [[Han Solo]]. He also appears at [[Jabba the Hutt]]'s palace in ''[[Return of the Jedi|Episode VI \u2013 Return of the Jedi]]'' (1983), attends at Solo and [[Luke Skywalker]]'s failed execution attempt and is presumably killed in the process. In 1997, he was [[Changes in Star Wars re-releases|retroactively added]] to the Special Edition of  ''[[Star Wars (film)|Episode IV \u2013 A New Hope]]''. The character is noted for speaking very few words and never removing his helmet in the [[original trilogy]].\n\nThe prequel film ''[[Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones]]'' (2002) establishes Boba Fett's origin as the cloned \"son\" of the bounty hunter [[Jango Fett]].

Fett tracks the starship to [[Bespin|Cloud City]], where Vader captures its passengers and [[torture]]s its captain, [[Han Solo]]. Aiming to collect a bounty on Solo, Fett questions Vader regarding the carbon freeze, which Vader intends to use on his true target, [[Luke Skywalker]]. Vader promises that the Empire will compensate Fett if Solo dies, but he survives and Vader turns him over to Fett.\n\n''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' features Boba Fett at [[Jabba the Hutt]]'s palace where Han Solo's rescuers are captured. He aims his weapon at [[Princess Leia]] (disguised as bounty hunter Boushh) when she threatens Jabba with a thermal detonator, and he later travels on Jabba's [[sail barge]] to the Great Pit of Carkoon, home of the [[Sarlacc]], where the prisoners are to be executed. When the prisoners mount an escape he attempts to intervene, and ends up in a tussle with Luke Skywalker, but Han Solo accidentally ignites Fett's rocket pack, sending the bounty hunter falling into the Sarlacc's mouth. In the 1997 Special Edition release of the film, Fett is featured flirting with some of the crime lord's female dancers while in the palace\u2014this was an entirely new scene, not included in any prior theatrical, broadcast, or home video version.  In this film, he does not have any verbal lines.\n\nFett appears in an episode of the 1985 ''[[Star Wars: Droids|Droids]]'' animated series set before the original trilogy and produced by the same studio as the animated segment of the ''Holiday Special''.

The series reveals that Fett became a family man at one point, though he was forcibly separated from his wife after killing his commanding officer for assaulting her. His wife subsequently disappeared and was presumed dead. Their granddaughter later sought Boba out and married a Mandalorian warrior. Boba's wife was discovered to still be alive, having been frozen in carbonite decades earlier.\n\n====''The Bounty Hunter Wars''====\n'''''The Bounty Hunter Wars''''' is a trilogy of science-fiction novels by [[K.W. Jeter]] and set in the ''Star Wars'' Expanded Universe during the events of the original trilogy. The books in the series were published by [[Bantam Spectra]] in July 1998, November 1998, and July 1999.\nThe trilogy depicts Fett as being more communicative than in the films because its plot requires Fett to show \"an ability to convince people as well as kill them\".<ref name=\"jeterinterview\" />\n\nThe first book, '''''{{visible anchor|The Mandalorian Armor}}''''', starts during the events of ''Return of the Jedi'', shortly after Jabba the Hutt's sail barge is destroyed. Dengar stays with Fett after the latter's near-death experience, and encounters Neelah, a dancer in Jabba's palace who has lost her memory, and thinks Fett can help her. Kuat of Kuat, an Imperial executive, reviews footage from the [[Great Pit of Carkoon]], leading him to suspect that Fett is still alive.\nIt is related in flashbacks set between ''A New Hope'' and ''The Empire Strikes Back'' that Fett stole a bounty Bossk and [[Zuckuss]] were hunting on behalf of the Bounty Hunters Guild. After delivering the bounty, Fett accepted a contract to join the Bounty Hunters Guild in order to break it up.\nThe Emperor met with Darth Vader and [[Prince Xizor]], where the latter revealed that it was he who planned for Fett to join the guild in order to eliminate its weakest members, leaving only the best for the Empire to exploit.\n\nIn the second book, '''''{{visible anchor|Slave Ship}}''''', Fett abandons the ''[[Slave I]]'' to avoid dispelling rumors of his death, and instead steals Bossk's ship. Riding along, Dengar tells Neelah about the split of the Bounty Hunters Guild. After Bossk killed his father, the guild split into two factions: one composed of the older members, and another composed of Bossk and other younger members. Prince Xizor placed an enormous bounty on a renegade stormtrooper who slaughtered his entire ship's crew. Fett, Bossk and Zuckuss captured the trooper, but Fett jettisoned his partners in an escape pod.\n\nIn the third and final book, '''''{{visible anchor|Hard Merchandise}}''''', it is related that Fett tried to claim his bounty, but found Xizor waiting to kill him in order to tie up loose ends related to his plot. In an attack on the megalomaniacal prince, Kuat of Kuat had falsified some evidence implicating him in the murder of Luke Skywalker's [[Beru Lars|aunt]] and [[Owen Lars|uncle]]. This information was on the renegade stormtrooper's ship (which is why Kuat wanted to make sure the bounty hunter was dead) but is retrieved by Fett in the present, as Neelah realizes she is from an elite Kuat family and stops her sinister sister from taking over the now-suicidal Imperial executive's shipyard.<ref>{{cite web |last=Asher-Perrin |first=Emmet |title=Okay, Boba Fett Likes Some People: Hard Merchandise |url=https://www.tor.com/2013/08/29/okay-boba-fett-likes-some-people-hard-merchandise/ |website=TOR.com |accessdate=September 22, 2019 |date=August 29, 2013}}</ref>\n\n====''Boba Fett: A Practical Man''====\n'''''Boba Fett: A Practical Man''''' is an [[e-book|e-novella]] by [[Karen Traviss]], which was published online in August 2006 by [[Del Rey Books]]. Set twenty years after the events of ''Return of the Jedi'', it focuses on what led Boba Fett and the Mandalorians to fend off the extragalactic [[Yuuzhan Vong]] invaders in ''The New Jedi Order: The Unifying Force'' (set a few months later).\nA Yuuzhan Vong named Nom Anor meets Fett on [[Mandalore]] and begins giving him and the Mandalorians directions to help their invasion.\nFett plans to do as much damage to the invaders as possible, even as he pretends to help them. He instructs a pilot to deliver his plea for help to the [[New Republic (Star Wars)#Legends|New Republic]], but with the Vong's next target still unwarned, the world falls without a fight.\nA Vong warrior asks Fett to assist in killing a Jedi; instead, Fett convinces the Jedi to deliver his message.\nThe Jedi returns and confirms that Fett has a deal: the Mandalorians will continue to masquerade as Vong mercenaries while passing intel to the Republic. Fett agrees to have a few of his best commandos train planetary militias to fight the Vong.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20061229225047/http://starwars.com/eu/lit/novel/news20060609.html announcement</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/eu/lit/novel/news20060728.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080618155301/http://www.starwars.com/eu/lit/novel/news20060728.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 18, 2008|title=Star Wars: Expanded Universe &#124; First Look: A Practical Man|date=June 18, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theforce.net/books/reviews/r_apracticalman.asp|title=TheForce.Net - Books - Reviews - A Practical Man|website=www.theforce.net}}</ref><ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20060821214727/http://www.ereader.com/product/book/excerpt/22631?book=Star_Wars%3A_Boba_Fett%3A_A_Practical_Man First eighteen paragraphs</ref>\n\n===Unproduced works===\nA planned live-action TV series developed by ''Star Wars'' creator [[George Lucas]] before the sale of Lucasfilm to Disney, titled ''[[Star Wars: Underworld]]'', would have featured Fett.<ref>{{cite web |last=Lyttelton |first=Oliver |title=Cancelled 'Star Wars: Underworld' TV Series Would Have Featured Young Versions Of Han, Chewie & Lando |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2014/06/cancelled-star-wars-underworld-tv-series-would-have-featured-young-versions-of-han-chewie-lando-84952/ |website=[[IndieWire]]|date=June 11, 2014|accessdate=March 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\n====''Star Wars 1313''====\nThe cancelled [[LucasArts]] video game '''''Star Wars 1313''''', originally announced at [[E3 2012]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/06/01/e3-2012-star-wars-1313-officially-announced|title=E3 2012: Star Wars: 1313 Officially Announced|author=Anthony Gallegos|date=May 31, 2012|work=Star Wars 1313|publisher=IGN|accessdate=June 6, 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Av2kHNhP?url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/06/01/e3-2012-star-wars-1313-officially-announced|archivedate=September 24, 2012|url-status=live|df=}}</ref> would have told the story of Boba Fett's career as a young adult bounty hunter between the prequel and original trilogies.<ref>{{cite web |last=Rosenberg |first=Adam |title=Star Wars 1313 will be the product of an evolved LucasArts |url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/star-wars-1313-will-be-the-product-of-an-evolved-lucasarts/ |website=Digital Trends |accessdate=September 27, 2019 |date=July 28, 2012}}</ref> In it, Fett would have navigated past the scum of civilization in an underground area of [[Coruscant]] known as Level 1313.<ref name=kotaku>{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/before-it-was-cancelled-star-wars-1313-was-going-to-be-470003660 |title=Before It Was Cancelled, Star Wars 1313 Was Going To Be About Boba Fett |publisher=Gawker.com |date=April 4, 2013 |accessdate=June 16, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/4/4183890/star-wars-1313-video-game-starred-boba-fett|title=Cancelled 'Star Wars 1313' video game would have starred Boba Fett|first=Andrew|last=Webster|accessdate=April 8, 2013|date=April 4, 2013|work=[[The Verge]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]}}</ref> In 2013, as a result of Disney's acquisition of the franchise, all LucasArts projects then in production were shelved.

He debuted in the now-non-canonical ''[[Star Wars Holiday Special]]'' (1978), as an antagonist to the main characters in the programme's animated segment. In ''[[The Empire Strikes Back|Episode V \u2013 The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980), he is hired by [[Darth Vader]] to capture [[Han Solo]]. He also appears at [[Jabba the Hutt]]'s palace in ''[[Return of the Jedi|Episode VI \u2013 Return of the Jedi]]'' (1983), attends at Solo and [[Luke Skywalker]]'s failed execution attempt and is presumably killed in the process. In 1997, he was [[Changes in Star Wars re-releases|retroactively added]] to the Special Edition of  ''[[Star Wars (film)|Episode IV \u2013 A New Hope]]''. The character is noted for speaking very few words and never removing his helmet in the [[original trilogy]].\n\nThe prequel film ''[[Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones]]'' (2002) establishes Boba Fett's origin as the cloned \"son\" of the bounty hunter [[Jango Fett]]. Boba also appears in episodes of the animated TV series ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|The Clone Wars]]'', bridging his storyline between the two trilogies.\n\nBoba Fett is also featured in many works of the ''[[Star Wars expanded to other media|Legends]]'' continuity, in which he is notably revealed to have survived his apparent death after falling into the [[Sarlacc's Pit]] in ''Return of the Jedi'', among other adventures. The character's popularity within the [[Star Wars fandom|''Star Wars'' fanbase]] has achieved him a [[Cult following|cult status]].\n\n==Appearances==\nThe character of Boba Fett made his first public appearance at the [[San Anselmo, California|San Anselmo]] Country<!--yes, \"country\" - cited source doesn't say \"county\", and county web m8 site says \"country\"--> Fair parade on 24 September 1978.<ref name=\"protofett1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/news/the-real-first-appearance-of-boba-fett/|title=The Real First Appearance Of Boba Fett|last=Ricca|first=Brad|date=July 8, 2014|publisher=[[Lucasfilm]]|page=1|accessdate=January 3, 2017}}</ref> The character debuted on television two months later in an [[Star Wars Holiday Special#Cartoon|animated segment]] produced by [[Nelvana]] for the ''[[Star Wars Holiday Special]]''.

Fett tracks the starship to [[Bespin|Cloud City]], where Vader captures its passengers and [[torture]]s its captain, [[Han Solo]]. Aiming to collect a bounty on Solo, Fett questions Vader regarding the carbon freeze, which Vader intends to use on his true target, [[Luke Skywalker]]. Vader promises that the Empire will compensate Fett if Solo dies, but he survives and Vader turns him over to Fett.\n\n''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' features Boba Fett at [[Jabba the Hutt]]'s palace where Han Solo's rescuers are captured. He aims his weapon at [[Princess Leia]] (disguised as bounty hunter Boushh) when she threatens Jabba with a thermal detonator, and he later travels on Jabba's [[sail barge]] to the Great Pit of Carkoon, home of the [[Sarlacc]], where the prisoners are to be executed. When the prisoners mount an escape he attempts to intervene, and ends up in a tussle with Luke Skywalker, but Han Solo accidentally ignites Fett's rocket pack, sending the bounty hunter falling into the Sarlacc's mouth. In the 1997 Special Edition release of the film, Fett is featured flirting with some of the crime lord's female dancers while in the palace\u2014this was an entirely new scene, not included in any prior theatrical, broadcast, or home video version.  In this film, he does not have any verbal lines.\n\nFett appears in an episode of the 1985 ''[[Star Wars: Droids|Droids]]'' animated series set before the original trilogy and produced by the same studio as the animated segment of the ''Holiday Special''. In \"A Race to the Finish\", Fett is hired by the Fromms to help them get revenge on the masters of the droids {{nowrap|R2-D2}} and {{nowrap|C-3PO}}.

The series reveals that Fett became a family man at one point, though he was forcibly separated from his wife after killing his commanding officer for assaulting her. His wife subsequently disappeared and was presumed dead. Their granddaughter later sought Boba out and married a Mandalorian warrior. Boba's wife was discovered to still be alive, having been frozen in carbonite decades earlier.\n\n====''The Bounty Hunter Wars''====\n'''''The Bounty Hunter Wars''''' is a trilogy of science-fiction novels by [[K.W. Jeter]] and set in the ''Star Wars'' Expanded Universe during the events of the original trilogy. The books in the series were published by [[Bantam Spectra]] in July 1998, November 1998, and July 1999.\nThe trilogy depicts Fett as being more communicative than in the films because its plot requires Fett to show \"an ability to convince people as well as kill them\".<ref name=\"jeterinterview\" />\n\nThe first book, '''''{{visible anchor|The Mandalorian Armor}}''''', starts during the events of ''Return of the Jedi'', shortly after Jabba the Hutt's sail barge is destroyed. Dengar stays with Fett after the latter's near-death experience, and encounters Neelah, a dancer in Jabba's palace who has lost her memory, and thinks Fett can help her. Kuat of Kuat, an Imperial executive, reviews footage from the [[Great Pit of Carkoon]], leading him to suspect that Fett is still alive.\nIt is related in flashbacks set between ''A New Hope'' and ''The Empire Strikes Back'' that Fett stole a bounty Bossk and [[Zuckuss]] were hunting on behalf of the Bounty Hunters Guild. After delivering the bounty, Fett accepted a contract to join the Bounty Hunters Guild in order to break it up.\nThe Emperor met with Darth Vader and [[Prince Xizor]], where the latter revealed that it was he who planned for Fett to join the guild in order to eliminate its weakest members, leaving only the best for the Empire to exploit.\n\nIn the second book, '''''{{visible anchor|Slave Ship}}''''', Fett abandons the ''[[Slave I]]'' to avoid dispelling rumors of his death, and instead steals Bossk's ship. Riding along, Dengar tells Neelah about the split of the Bounty Hunters Guild. After Bossk killed his father, the guild split into two factions: one composed of the older members, and another composed of Bossk and other younger members. Prince Xizor placed an enormous bounty on a renegade stormtrooper who slaughtered his entire ship's crew. Fett, Bossk and Zuckuss captured the trooper, but Fett jettisoned his partners in an escape pod.\n\nIn the third and final book, '''''{{visible anchor|Hard Merchandise}}''''', it is related that Fett tried to claim his bounty, but found Xizor waiting to kill him in order to tie up loose ends related to his plot. In an attack on the megalomaniacal prince, Kuat of Kuat had falsified some evidence implicating him in the murder of Luke Skywalker's [[Beru Lars|aunt]] and [[Owen Lars|uncle]]. This information was on the renegade stormtrooper's ship (which is why Kuat wanted to make sure the bounty hunter was dead) but is retrieved by Fett in the present, as Neelah realizes she is from an elite Kuat family and stops her sinister sister from taking over the now-suicidal Imperial executive's shipyard.<ref>{{cite web |last=Asher-Perrin |first=Emmet |title=Okay, Boba Fett Likes Some People: Hard Merchandise |url=https://www.tor.com/2013/08/29/okay-boba-fett-likes-some-people-hard-merchandise/ |website=TOR.com |accessdate=September 22, 2019 |date=August 29, 2013}}</ref>\n\n====''Boba Fett: A Practical Man''====\n'''''Boba Fett: A Practical Man''''' is an [[e-book|e-novella]] by [[Karen Traviss]], which was published online in August 2006 by [[Del Rey Books]]. Set twenty years after the events of ''Return of the Jedi'', it focuses on what led Boba Fett and the Mandalorians to fend off the extragalactic [[Yuuzhan Vong]] invaders in ''The New Jedi Order: The Unifying Force'' (set a few months later).\nA Yuuzhan Vong named Nom Anor meets Fett on [[Mandalore]] and begins giving him and the Mandalorians directions to help their invasion.\nFett plans to do as much damage to the invaders as possible, even as he pretends to help them. He instructs a pilot to deliver his plea for help to the [[New Republic (Star Wars)#Legends|New Republic]], but with the Vong's next target still unwarned, the world falls without a fight.\nA Vong warrior asks Fett to assist in killing a Jedi; instead, Fett convinces the Jedi to deliver his message.\nThe Jedi returns and confirms that Fett has a deal: the Mandalorians will continue to masquerade as Vong mercenaries while passing intel to the Republic. Fett agrees to have a few of his best commandos train planetary militias to fight the Vong.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20061229225047/http://starwars.com/eu/lit/novel/news20060609.html announcement</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/eu/lit/novel/news20060728.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080618155301/http://www.starwars.com/eu/lit/novel/news20060728.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 18, 2008|title=Star Wars: Expanded Universe &#124; First Look: A Practical Man|date=June 18, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theforce.net/books/reviews/r_apracticalman.asp|title=TheForce.Net - Books - Reviews - A Practical Man|website=www.theforce.net}}</ref><ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20060821214727/http://www.ereader.com/product/book/excerpt/22631?book=Star_Wars%3A_Boba_Fett%3A_A_Practical_Man First eighteen paragraphs</ref>\n\n===Unproduced works===\nA planned live-action TV series developed by ''Star Wars'' creator [[George Lucas]] before the sale of Lucasfilm to Disney, titled ''[[Star Wars: Underworld]]'', would have featured Fett.<ref>{{cite web |last=Lyttelton |first=Oliver |title=Cancelled 'Star Wars: Underworld' TV Series Would Have Featured Young Versions Of Han, Chewie & Lando |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2014/06/cancelled-star-wars-underworld-tv-series-would-have-featured-young-versions-of-han-chewie-lando-84952/ |website=[[IndieWire]]|date=June 11, 2014|accessdate=March 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\n====''Star Wars 1313''====\nThe cancelled [[LucasArts]] video game '''''Star Wars 1313''''', originally announced at [[E3 2012]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/06/01/e3-2012-star-wars-1313-officially-announced|title=E3 2012: Star Wars: 1313 Officially Announced|author=Anthony Gallegos|date=May 31, 2012|work=Star Wars 1313|publisher=IGN|accessdate=June 6, 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Av2kHNhP?url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/06/01/e3-2012-star-wars-1313-officially-announced|archivedate=September 24, 2012|url-status=live|df=}}</ref> would have told the story of Boba Fett's career as a young adult bounty hunter between the prequel and original trilogies.<ref>{{cite web |last=Rosenberg |first=Adam |title=Star Wars 1313 will be the product of an evolved LucasArts |url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/star-wars-1313-will-be-the-product-of-an-evolved-lucasarts/ |website=Digital Trends |accessdate=September 27, 2019 |date=July 28, 2012}}</ref> In it, Fett would have navigated past the scum of civilization in an underground area of [[Coruscant]] known as Level 1313.<ref name=kotaku>{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/before-it-was-cancelled-star-wars-1313-was-going-to-be-470003660 |title=Before It Was Cancelled, Star Wars 1313 Was Going To Be About Boba Fett |publisher=Gawker.com |date=April 4, 2013 |accessdate=June 16, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/4/4183890/star-wars-1313-video-game-starred-boba-fett|title=Cancelled 'Star Wars 1313' video game would have starred Boba Fett|first=Andrew|last=Webster|accessdate=April 8, 2013|date=April 4, 2013|work=[[The Verge]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]}}</ref> In 2013, as a result of Disney's acquisition of the franchise, all LucasArts projects then in production were shelved.

Most personal computers possess a [[Computer monitor|monitor]], a [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]], a [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]], and a [[computer case]]. The computer case encloses and holds all of the necessary hardware required to store and process data on the computer. The motherboard ensures that all other inner computer hardware communicates with each other. The CPU executes instructions for running computer programs. RAM is responsible for the temporary storage of data while the computer operates.\n\n[[Laptop]]s are designed for portability and are generally very similar to PCs,<ref name=\"PC hardware\" /> although they may use lower-power or reduced size components, thus lower performance for a given price point.<ref name=\"desktopvslaptopcomputer\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch001399.htm |title=Desktop computer vs. Laptop computer |date=2019-12-30 |website=www.computerhope.com |access-date=2020-01-15}}</ref> Due to their portability, all units of computer hardware in a laptop are integrated within the laptop's computer case. The monitor is found in the upper cover of the laptop, and it and the laptop itself can be secured by closing the cover. Instead of a mouse, laptops usually may have a [[trackpad]] attached below the in-built keyboard.\n\n====Case====\n{{Main|Computer case}}\n\nThe computer case encloses and holds most of the components of the system. It provides mechanical support and protection for internal elements such as the motherboard, disk drives, and power supplies, and controls and directs the flow of cooling air over internal components. The case is also part of the system to control electromagnetic interference radiated by the computer and protects internal parts from electrostatic discharge. Large tower cases provide extra internal space for multiple disk drives or other peripherals and usually stand on the floor, while desktop cases provide less expansion room. All-in-one style designs include a video display built into the same case. Portable and laptop computers require cases that provide impact protection for the unit. A current development in laptop computers is a detachable keyboard, which allows the system to be configured as a touch-screen tablet. Hobbyists may decorate the cases with colored lights, paint, or other features, in an activity called [[case modding]].\n\n====Power supply====\n{{Main|Power supply unit (computer)|l1=Power supply unit}}\n\nA power supply unit (PSU) converts alternating current (AC) electric power to low-voltage direct current (DC) power for the internal components of the computer.

The CPU is a [[microprocessor]], which is [[semiconductor device fabrication|fabricated]] on a [[metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor]] (MOS) [[integrated circuit]] (IC) chip. It is usually [[CPU cooling|cooled]] by a heat sink and fan, or water-cooling system. Most newer CPU includes an on-die [[graphics processing unit]] (GPU). The [[clock speed]] of CPU governs how fast it executes instructions and is measured in GHz; typical values lie between 1&nbsp;GHz and 5&nbsp;GHz. Many modern computers have the option to overclock the CPU which enhances performance at the expense of greater thermal output and thus a need for improved cooling.\n* The [[chipset]], which includes the [[Northbridge (computing)|north bridge]], mediates communication between the CPU and the other components of the system, including main memory; as well as [[Southbridge (computing)|south bridge]], which is connected to the north bridge, and supports auxiliary interfaces and buses; and, finally, a [[Super I/O]] chip, connected through the south bridge, which supports the slowest and most legacy components like [[serial port]]s, [[hardware monitoring]] and [[fan control]].\n*[[Random-access memory]] (RAM), which stores the code and data that are being actively accessed by the CPU. For example, when a web browser is opened on the computer it takes up memory; this is stored in the RAM until the web browser is closed. It is typically a type of [[dynamic RAM]] (DRAM), such as [[synchronous DRAM]] (SDRAM), where [[MOS memory]] chips store data on [[memory cell (computing)|memory cells]] consisting of MOSFETs and [[MOS capacitor]]s. RAM usually comes on [[dual in-line memory module]]s (DIMMs) in the sizes of 2GB, 4GB, and 8GB, but can be much larger.\n*[[Read-only memory]] (ROM), which stores the [[BIOS]] that runs when the computer is powered on or otherwise begins execution, a process known as [[Bootstrapping (computing)|Bootstrapping]], or \"[[booting]]\" or \"booting up\". The ROM is typically a [[nonvolatile BIOS memory]] chip, which stores data on [[floating-gate MOSFET]] memory cells.\n** The [[BIOS]] (Basic Input Output System) includes boot [[firmware]] and power management firmware. Newer motherboards use [[Unified Extensible Firmware Interface]] (UEFI) instead of BIOS.\n*[[Bus (computing)|Buses]] that connect the CPU to various internal components and to expand cards for graphics and sound.\n* The [[CMOS]] (complementary MOS) [[electric battery|battery]], which powers the [[CMOS memory]] for date and time in the BIOS chip. This battery is generally a [[watch battery]].\n* The [[video card]] (also known as the graphics card), which processes computer graphics. More powerful graphics cards are better suited to handle strenuous tasks, such as playing intensive [[video games]] or running [[computer graphics]] software. A video card contains a [[graphics processing unit]] (GPU) and [[video memory]] (typically a type of [[SDRAM]]), both fabricated on [[MOS integrated circuit]] (MOS IC) chips.\n*[[Power MOSFET]]s make up the [[voltage regulator module]] (VRM), which controls how much [[voltage]] other hardware components receive.<ref name=\"tomshardware\"/>\n\n====Expansion cards====\n{{Main|Expansion card}}\n\nAn [[expansion card]] in computing is a printed circuit board that can be inserted into an expansion slot of a computer motherboard or backplane to add functionality to a computer system via the expansion bus. Expansion cards can be used to obtain or expand on features not offered by the motherboard.\n\n====Storage devices====\n{{Main|Computer data storage}}\n\nA storage device is any computing hardware and [[digital media]] that is used for storing, porting and extracting data files and objects. It can hold and store information both temporarily and permanently and can be internal or external to a computer, server or any similar computing device. Data storage is a core function and fundamental component of computers.\n\n=====Fixed media=====\nData is stored by a computer using a variety of media. [[Hard disk drive]]s (HDDs) are found in virtually all older computers, due to their high capacity and low cost, but [[solid-state drive]]s (SSDs) are faster and more power efficient, although currently more expensive than hard drives in terms of dollar per gigabyte,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Domingo|first1=Joel|title=SSD vs. HDD: What's the Difference?|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2404258,00.asp|publisher=[[PCMag]]|accessdate=24 March 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170319184712/http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2404258,00.asp|archivedate=19 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> so are often found in personal computers built post-2007.<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Edwards|first1=Benj|title=Evolution of the Solid-State Drive|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/246617/storage/evolution-of-the-solid-state-drive.html#slide13|magazine=[[PCWorld]]|accessdate=24 March 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170325201429/http://www.pcworld.com/article/246617/storage/evolution-of-the-solid-state-drive.html#slide13|archivedate=25 March 2017|df=dmy-all|date=2012-01-17}}</ref> SSDs use [[flash memory]], which stores data on [[MOS memory]] chips consisting of [[floating-gate MOSFET]] [[memory cell (computing)|memory cells]]. Some systems may use a [[disk array controller]] for greater performance or reliability.\n\n=====Removable media=====\nTo transfer data between computers, an external [[flash memory]] device (such as a [[memory card]] or [[USB flash drive]]) or [[optical disc]] (such as a [[CD-ROM]], [[DVD-ROM]] or [[BD-ROM]]) may be used. Their usefulness depends on being readable by other systems; the majority of machines have an [[optical disk drive]] (ODD), and virtually all have at least one [[Universal Serial Bus]] (USB) port.\n\n====Input and output peripherals====\n{{Main|Peripheral}}\n\n[[Input device|Input]] and [[Output device|output]] devices are typically housed externally to the main computer chassis. The following are either standard or very common to many computer systems.\n\n=====Input device=====\n[[Input devices]] allow the user to enter information into the system, or control its operation. Most personal computers have a [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]] and [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]], but laptop systems typically use a [[touchpad]] instead of a mouse. Other input devices include [[webcam]]s, [[microphone]]s, [[joystick]]s, and [[image scanner]]s.\n\n=====Output device=====\n[[Output device]]s are designed around the senses of human beings. For example, monitors display text that can be read, speakers produce sound that can be heard.<ref>{{cite book |title=PC hardware : a beginner's guide |date=2001 |publisher=Osborne/McGraw-Hill |isbn=9780072129908 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/pchardwarebeginn00gils/page/20 20] |url=https://archive.org/details/pchardwarebeginn00gils/page/20 }}</ref> Such devices could include [[Printer (computing)|printer]]s, [[Computer speaker|speakers]], [[Computer monitor|monitors]] or a [[Braille embosser]].\n\n===Mainframe computer===\n{{Main|Mainframe Computer}}\nA [[mainframe computer]] is a much larger computer that typically fills a room and may cost many hundreds or thousands of times as much as a personal computer.

As of June 2018, the fastest supercomputer on the [[TOP500]]<nowiki/>supercomputer list is the [[Summit (supercomputer)|Summit]], in the United States, with a [[LINPACK benchmark]]<nowiki/>score of 122.3 PFLOPS   [[Sunway TaihuLight|Light]], by around 29 PFLOPS.\n\nThe term supercomputer does not refer to a specific technology. Rather it indicates the fastest computations available at any given time. In mid-2011, the fastest supercomputers boasted speeds exceeding one petaflop, or 1 quadrillion (10^15 or 1,000 trillion) floating-point operations per second.\nSupercomputers are fast but extremely costly, so they are generally used by large organizations to execute computationally demanding tasks involving large data sets. Supercomputers typically run military and scientific applications. Although costly, they are also being used for commercial applications where huge amounts of data must be analyzed. For example, large banks employ supercomputers to calculate the risks and returns of various investment strategies, and healthcare organizations use them to analyze giant databases of patient data to determine optimal treatments for various diseases and problems incurring to the country.\n\n{{Expand section|[[mobile phone]], [[cloud computing]], [[embedded system]] and [[internet of things]] hardware; [[systems on chip]] more generally|date=October 2018}}\n\n==Hardware upgrade==\nWhen using computer hardware, an [[upgrade]] means adding new hardware to a computer that improves its performance, increases its capacity, or adds new features. For example, a user could perform a hardware upgrade to replace the [[hard drive]] with a faster one or an [[SSD]] to get a boost in performance. Also, the user could install more RAM so the computer may run more smoothly. The user could add a [[USB 3.0]] [[expansion card]] to fully use USB 3.0 devices, or could upgrade the [[GPU]] for extra rendering power. Performing such hardware upgrades may be necessary for older computers to meet a program's system requirements.\n\n==Sales==\nGlobal revenue from computer hardware in 2016 reached 408 billion Euros.<ref>{{cite web |title=Global revenue from computer hardware from 2005 to 2016 |url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/268633/worldwide-revenue-from-computer-hardware-since-2005/ |website=Statista |accessdate=15 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Recycling==\n{{main|Computer recycling}}\n{{globalize|section|USA|date=January 2020}}\nBecause computer parts contain [[hazard]]ous materials, there is a growing movement to recycle old and outdated parts.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-to-recycle-your-old-computer/|title=How to recycle your old computer|date=2016-12-18|work=Digital Trends|access-date=2017-04-18|language=en-US|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170417055533/http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-to-recycle-your-old-computer/|archivedate=17 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Computer hardware contain dangerous chemicals such as: lead, mercury, nickel, and cadmium.

It is a board with [[integrated circuit]]ry that connects the other parts of the computer including the [[CPU]], the [[RAM]], the disk drives ([[CD]], [[DVD]], [[hard disk]], or any others) as well as any peripherals connected via the ports or the [[expansion slot]]s. The [[integrated circuit]] (IC) chips in a computer typically contain billions of tiny [[metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor field-effect transistor]]s (MOSFETs).<ref name=\"computerhistory2018\">{{cite web |title=13 Sextillion & Counting: The Long & Winding Road to the Most Frequently Manufactured Human Artifact in History |url=https://www.computerhistory.org/atchm/13-sextillion-counting-the-long-winding-road-to-the-most-frequently-manufactured-human-artifact-in-history/ |date=April 2, 2018 |website=[[Computer History Museum]] |accessdate=28 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nComponents directly attached to or to part of the motherboard include:\n* The [[central processing unit|CPU]] (central processing unit), which performs most of the calculations which enable a computer to function, and is referred to as the brain of the computer which get a hold of program instruction from [[random-access memory]] (RAM), interprets and processes it and then send it backs to computer result so that the relevant components can carry out the instructions. The CPU is a [[microprocessor]], which is [[semiconductor device fabrication|fabricated]] on a [[metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor]] (MOS) [[integrated circuit]] (IC) chip. It is usually [[CPU cooling|cooled]] by a heat sink and fan, or water-cooling system. Most newer CPU includes an on-die [[graphics processing unit]] (GPU). The [[clock speed]] of CPU governs how fast it executes instructions and is measured in GHz; typical values lie between 1&nbsp;GHz and 5&nbsp;GHz. Many modern computers have the option to overclock the CPU which enhances performance at the expense of greater thermal output and thus a need for improved cooling.\n* The [[chipset]], which includes the [[Northbridge (computing)|north bridge]], mediates communication between the CPU and the other components of the system, including main memory; as well as [[Southbridge (computing)|south bridge]], which is connected to the north bridge, and supports auxiliary interfaces and buses; and, finally, a [[Super I/O]] chip, connected through the south bridge, which supports the slowest and most legacy components like [[serial port]]s, [[hardware monitoring]] and [[fan control]].\n*[[Random-access memory]] (RAM), which stores the code and data that are being actively accessed by the CPU. For example, when a web browser is opened on the computer it takes up memory; this is stored in the RAM until the web browser is closed. It is typically a type of [[dynamic RAM]] (DRAM), such as [[synchronous DRAM]] (SDRAM), where [[MOS memory]] chips store data on [[memory cell (computing)|memory cells]] consisting of MOSFETs and [[MOS capacitor]]s. RAM usually comes on [[dual in-line memory module]]s (DIMMs) in the sizes of 2GB, 4GB, and 8GB, but can be much larger.\n*[[Read-only memory]] (ROM), which stores the [[BIOS]] that runs when the computer is powered on or otherwise begins execution, a process known as [[Bootstrapping (computing)|Bootstrapping]], or \"[[booting]]\" or \"booting up\". The ROM is typically a [[nonvolatile BIOS memory]] chip, which stores data on [[floating-gate MOSFET]] memory cells.\n** The [[BIOS]] (Basic Input Output System) includes boot [[firmware]] and power management firmware. Newer motherboards use [[Unified Extensible Firmware Interface]] (UEFI) instead of BIOS.\n*[[Bus (computing)|Buses]] that connect the CPU to various internal components and to expand cards for graphics and sound.\n* The [[CMOS]] (complementary MOS) [[electric battery|battery]], which powers the [[CMOS memory]] for date and time in the BIOS chip. This battery is generally a [[watch battery]].\n* The [[video card]] (also known as the graphics card), which processes computer graphics. More powerful graphics cards are better suited to handle strenuous tasks, such as playing intensive [[video games]] or running [[computer graphics]] software. A video card contains a [[graphics processing unit]] (GPU) and [[video memory]] (typically a type of [[SDRAM]]), both fabricated on [[MOS integrated circuit]] (MOS IC) chips.\n*[[Power MOSFET]]s make up the [[voltage regulator module]] (VRM), which controls how much [[voltage]] other hardware components receive.<ref name=\"tomshardware\"/>\n\n====Expansion cards====\n{{Main|Expansion card}}\n\nAn [[expansion card]] in computing is a printed circuit board that can be inserted into an expansion slot of a computer motherboard or backplane to add functionality to a computer system via the expansion bus. Expansion cards can be used to obtain or expand on features not offered by the motherboard.\n\n====Storage devices====\n{{Main|Computer data storage}}\n\nA storage device is any computing hardware and [[digital media]] that is used for storing, porting and extracting data files and objects. It can hold and store information both temporarily and permanently and can be internal or external to a computer, server or any similar computing device. Data storage is a core function and fundamental component of computers.\n\n=====Fixed media=====\nData is stored by a computer using a variety of media.

Their usefulness depends on being readable by other systems; the majority of machines have an [[optical disk drive]] (ODD), and virtually all have at least one [[Universal Serial Bus]] (USB) port.\n\n====Input and output peripherals====\n{{Main|Peripheral}}\n\n[[Input device|Input]] and [[Output device|output]] devices are typically housed externally to the main computer chassis. The following are either standard or very common to many computer systems.\n\n=====Input device=====\n[[Input devices]] allow the user to enter information into the system, or control its operation. Most personal computers have a [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]] and [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]], but laptop systems typically use a [[touchpad]] instead of a mouse. Other input devices include [[webcam]]s, [[microphone]]s, [[joystick]]s, and [[image scanner]]s.\n\n=====Output device=====\n[[Output device]]s are designed around the senses of human beings. For example, monitors display text that can be read, speakers produce sound that can be heard.<ref>{{cite book |title=PC hardware : a beginner's guide |date=2001 |publisher=Osborne/McGraw-Hill |isbn=9780072129908 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/pchardwarebeginn00gils/page/20 20] |url=https://archive.org/details/pchardwarebeginn00gils/page/20 }}</ref> Such devices could include [[Printer (computing)|printer]]s, [[Computer speaker|speakers]], [[Computer monitor|monitors]] or a [[Braille embosser]].\n\n===Mainframe computer===\n{{Main|Mainframe Computer}}\nA [[mainframe computer]] is a much larger computer that typically fills a room and may cost many hundreds or thousands of times as much as a personal computer.

As of June 2018, the fastest supercomputer on the [[TOP500]]<nowiki/>supercomputer list is the [[Summit (supercomputer)|Summit]], in the United States, with a [[LINPACK benchmark]]<nowiki/>score of 122.3 PFLOPS   [[Sunway TaihuLight|Light]], by around 29 PFLOPS.\n\nThe term supercomputer does not refer to a specific technology. Rather it indicates the fastest computations available at any given time. In mid-2011, the fastest supercomputers boasted speeds exceeding one petaflop, or 1 quadrillion (10^15 or 1,000 trillion) floating-point operations per second.\nSupercomputers are fast but extremely costly, so they are generally used by large organizations to execute computationally demanding tasks involving large data sets. Supercomputers typically run military and scientific applications. Although costly, they are also being used for commercial applications where huge amounts of data must be analyzed. For example, large banks employ supercomputers to calculate the risks and returns of various investment strategies, and healthcare organizations use them to analyze giant databases of patient data to determine optimal treatments for various diseases and problems incurring to the country.\n\n{{Expand section|[[mobile phone]], [[cloud computing]], [[embedded system]] and [[internet of things]] hardware; [[systems on chip]] more generally|date=October 2018}}\n\n==Hardware upgrade==\nWhen using computer hardware, an [[upgrade]] means adding new hardware to a computer that improves its performance, increases its capacity, or adds new features. For example, a user could perform a hardware upgrade to replace the [[hard drive]] with a faster one or an [[SSD]] to get a boost in performance. Also, the user could install more RAM so the computer may run more smoothly. The user could add a [[USB 3.0]] [[expansion card]] to fully use USB 3.0 devices, or could upgrade the [[GPU]] for extra rendering power.

Disaster awaited at Rd 10 in [[Masaryk Circuit|Brno]] however. During qualifying a small deer ran onto the track right into the path of Azuma's accelerating motorcycle. In the ensuing crash, Azuma was not seriously injured and raced the next day eventually finishing 12th. However, it was to be a turning point in the year, and perhaps his career. The remaining six rounds saw erratic and relatively poor results from Azuma, while his title rivals [[Marco Melandri]] and [[Emilio Alzamora]] gained on him in the Championship. Melandri scored 5 race wins in the latter half of the season, and Champion-to-be Alzamora's consistent podium finishes would eventually relegate Azuma to 3rd in the Championship. This was to be his highest Championship finish.\n\n== 2000 ==\nNow under the Benetton Playlife banner, Azuma's [[2000 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|2000]] season was an erratic one with four DNFs countered by six podiums. He put together a good string of results towards the end of the season with a fifth, two second places and a win at the final round in Australia, but the inconsistency up to then meant he couldn't challenge for the title. He finished the championship in fourth.\n\n== 2001 ==\nThe [[2001 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|2001]] season started out promising with Azuma winning two of the first three races. (By winning the first race of the new season and the last race of the previous season Azuma was to set a 125 class record that would not be repeated again until [[2007 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|2007]] when [[Hector Faubel]] won the [[2006 Valencian Community motorcycle Grand Prix|last race of 2006]] and the [[2007 Qatar motorcycle Grand Prix|first race of 2007]].) However, an inconsistent season was to follow and Azuma never managed to make it onto the podium during the rest of the season. He finished 5th in the Championship almost 100 pts adrift of eventual Champion [[Manuel Poggiali]].\n\n== 2002 ==\nNow in the Trial by Breil team, Azuma's [[2002 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|2002]] season got off to a slow start, his only podium appearance being a win at the [[Brazilian motorcycle Grand Prix|Brazilian Grand Prix]] near the end of the season. This was to be his final win at World Championship level. He finished the season 8th in the Championship.\n\n== 2003 ==\nMoving to the Ajo Motorsports team, Azuma struggled to make headway, with only 4 Top 10 finishes all season and 7 DNFs. He announced his retirement at his home race, the Pacific GP at Motegi, with 3 rounds still to go. At the GP in Australia, he recorded his best result all year with a 2nd place.
