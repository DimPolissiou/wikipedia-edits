It is related by an unnamed narrator who endeavors to convince the reader of the narrator\u2019s sanity while simultaneously describing a murder the narrator committed. The victim was an old man with a filmy \"vulture-eye\", as the narrator calls it. The narrator emphasizes the careful calculation of the murder, attempting the perfect crime, complete with dismembering and hiding the body under the floorboards. Ultimately, the narrator's feelings of guilt, or a mental disturbance, result in hearing a thumping sound, which the narrator interprets as the dead man's beating heart.\n\nThe story was first published in [[James Russell Lowell]]'s ''The Pioneer'' in January 1843. \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is often considered a classic of the [[Gothic fiction]] genre and is one of Poe's best known short stories.\n\nThe specific motivation for murder (aside from the narrator's dislike of the old man's eye), the relationship between narrator and old man, the gender of the narrator and other details are left unclear. The narrator denies having any feelings of hatred or resentment for the man who had, as stated, never wronged the narrator. The narrator also denies having killed for greed. \n\nIt has been speculated that the old man is a father figure, the narrator's landlord, or that the narrator works for the old man as a servant, and that perhaps his \"vulture-eye\" represents some sort of veiled secret, or power. The ambiguity and lack of details about the two main characters stand in stark contrast to the specific plot details leading up to the murder.\n\n==Plot summary==\n[[File:Clarke-TellTaleHeart.jpeg|thumb|left|Illustration by [[Harry Clarke]], 1919]]\n\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is told from a [[first-person narrative]] of an unnamed narrator, who insists on being sane, but is suffering from a disease (nervousness) which causes \"[[Hyperesthesia|over-acuteness of the senses]]\". \n\nThe old man with whom the narrator lives has a clouded, pale, blue \"[[vulture]]-like\" eye, which distresses the narrator so much that the narrator plots to murder the old man, despite also insisting that the narrator loves the old man. The narrator insists that this careful precision in committing the murder proves that the narrator cannot possibly be insane. For seven nights, the narrator opens the door of the old man's room in order to shine a sliver of light onto the \"evil eye\". However, the old man's vulture-eye is always closed, making it impossible to \"do the work\".\n\nOn the eighth night, the old man awakens after the narrator's hand slips and makes a noise, interrupting the narrator's nightly ritual. But the narrator does not draw back and, after some time, decides to open the lantern. A single thin ray of light shines out and lands precisely on the \"evil eye\", revealing that it is wide open. Hearing the old man's heart beating loudly and dangerously fast from terror, the narrator decides to strike, jumping out with a loud yell and smothering the old man with his own bed. The narrator then dismembers the body and conceals the pieces under the floorboards, and ensures the concealment of all signs of the crime. Even so, the old man's scream during the night causes a neighbor to report to the police, who the narrator invites in to look around. The narrator claims that the scream heard was the narrator's own in a nightmare and that the man is absent in the country. Confident that they will not find any evidence of the murder, the narrator brings chairs for them and they sit in the old man's room, on the very spot where the body is concealed, and suspect nothing, as the narrator has a pleasant and easy manner.\n\nThe narrator begins to feel uncomfortable and notices a ringing in the narrator's ears. As the ringing grows louder, the narrator comes to the conclusion that it is the heartbeat of the old man coming from under the floorboards. The sound increases steadily, though the officers seem to pay no attention to it. Terrified by the violent beating of the heart, and convinced that the officers are aware not only of the heartbeat but also of the narrator's guilt, the narrator breaks down and confesses, telling them to tear up the floorboards to reveal the remains of the old man's body.\n\n== Publication history ==\n[[File:Tell tale heart in pioneer.jpg|thumb|\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" in ''The Pioneer: A Literary and Critical Magazine'', page 29]]\n\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" was first published in January 1843 in the inaugural issue of ''The Pioneer: A Literary and Critical Magazine'', a short-lived [[Boston]] magazine edited by [[James Russell Lowell]] and [[Robert Carter (editor)|Robert Carter]] who were listed as the \"proprietors\" on the front cover. The magazine was published in Boston by Leland and Whiting and in Philadelphia by Drew and Scammell.\n\nPoe was likely paid $10 for the story.<ref name=\"Silverman-p201\">Silverman, Kenneth.

The exactness with which the narrator recounts murdering the old man, as if the stealthy way in which they executed the crime were evidence of their sanity, reveals their [[monomania]] and [[paranoia]]. The focus of the story is the perverse scheme to commit the [[perfect crime]].<ref>Kennedy, J. Gerald. ''Poe, Death, and the Life of Writing''. Yale University Press, 1987. p. 132; {{ISBN|0-300-03773-2}}</ref>\n\nThe narrator of \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is generally assumed to be a male. However, some critics have suggested a woman may be narrating; no pronouns are used to clarify one way or the other.<ref name=Sova234>Sova, Dawn B. ''Edgar Allan Poe: A to Z''. New York City: Checkmark Books, 2001: 234. {{ISBN|0-8160-4161-X}}</ref> The story starts ''[[in medias res]]''. The story opens with a conversation already in progress between the narrator and another person who is not identified in any way. It has been speculated that the narrator is confessing to a prison warden, a judge, a reporter, a doctor or ([[Anachronism|anachronistically]]) a psychiatrist.<ref name=\"Benfey-p30\">[[Christopher Benfey|Benfey, Christopher]]. \"Poe and the Unreadable: 'The Black Cat' and 'The Tell-Tale Heart'\", in ''New Essays on Poe's Major Tales'', Kenneth Silverman, ed.

This, however, is self-destructive, because in attempting to prove their sanity, they fully admit that they are guilty of murder.<ref name=\"Robinson-p94\">Robinson, E.

Despite this, they say, the idea of murder \"haunted me day and night.\"<ref name=\"Robinson-p94\"/>\n\nThe story's final scene shows the result of the narrator's feelings of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]]. Like many characters in [[Gothic fiction]], they allow their nerves to dictate their nature. Despite their best efforts at defending themself, their \"over-acuteness of the senses\", which help them hear the heart beating beneath the floorboards, is evidence that they are truly mad.<ref name=\"Fisher-p87\">Fisher, Benjamin Franklin. \"Poe and the Gothic Tradition\", in ''The Cambridge Companion to Edgar Allan Poe'', edited by Kevin J.

A similar [[motif (narrative)|motif]] is used for Roderick Usher in \"[[The Fall of the House of Usher]]\" (1839) and in \"The Colloquy of Monos and Una\" (1841).<ref name=\"Reilly\"/> It is unclear, however, if the narrator actually has very [[:wikt:acute|acute]] senses, or if they are merely imagining things. If their condition is believed to be true, what they hear at the end of the story may not be the old man's heart, but [[deathwatch beetle]]s. The narrator first admits to hearing beetles in the wall after startling the old man from his sleep. According to superstition, deathwatch beetles are a sign of impending death. One variety of deathwatch beetle raps its head against surfaces, presumably as part of a mating ritual, while others emit ticking sounds.<ref name=\"Reilly\">Reilly, John E. \"[http://www.eapoe.org/papers/misc1990/jer19691.htm The Lesser Death-Watch and \"'The Tell-Tale Heart'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091218172125/http://www.eapoe.org/papers/misc1990/jer19691.htm |date=December 18, 2009 }}\", in ''The American Transcendental Quarterly''.

Their names, occupations, and places of residence are not given, contrasting with the strict attention to detail in the plot.<ref name=\"Benfey-p32\">Benfey, ''New Essays'', p. 32.</ref> The narrator may be a servant of the old man's or, as is more often assumed, his child. In that case, the \"vulture-eye\" of the old man as a father figure may symbolize parental surveillance, or the paternal principles of right and wrong. The murder of the eye, then, is a removal of conscience.<ref name=\"Hoffman-p223\">Hoffman, Daniel. ''Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe''.

It is related by an unnamed narrator who endeavors to convince the reader of the narrator\u2019s sanity while simultaneously describing a murder the narrator committed. The victim was an old man with a filmy \"vulture-eye\", as the narrator calls it. The narrator emphasizes the careful calculation of the murder, attempting the perfect crime, complete with dismembering and hiding the body under the floorboards. Ultimately, the narrator's feelings of guilt, or a mental disturbance, result in hearing a thumping sound, which the narrator interprets as the dead man's beating heart.\n\nThe story was first published in [[James Russell Lowell]]'s ''The Pioneer'' in January 1843. \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is often considered a classic of the [[Gothic fiction]] genre and is one of Poe's best known short stories.\n\nThe specific motivation for murder (aside from the narrator's dislike of the old man's eye), the relationship between narrator and old man, the gender of the narrator and other details are left unclear. The narrator denies having any feelings of hatred or resentment for the man who had, as stated, never wronged the narrator. The narrator also denies having killed for greed. \n\nIt has been speculated that the old man is a father figure, the narrator's landlord, or that the narrator works for the old man as a servant, and that perhaps his \"vulture-eye\" represents some sort of veiled secret, or power. The ambiguity and lack of details about the two main characters stand in stark contrast to the specific plot details leading up to the murder.\n\n==Plot summary==\n[[File:Clarke-TellTaleHeart.jpeg|thumb|left|Illustration by [[Harry Clarke]], 1919]]\n\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is a [[first-person narrative]] of an unnamed narrator, who insists on being sane, but is suffering from a disease (nervousness) which causes \"[[Hyperesthesia|over-acuteness of the senses]]\". \n\nThe old man with whom the narrator lives has a clouded, pale, blue \"[[vulture]]-like\" eye, which distresses the narrator so much that the narrator plots to murder the old man, despite also insisting that the narrator loves the old man. The narrator insists that this careful precision in committing the murder proves that the narrator cannot possibly be insane. For seven nights, the narrator opens the door of the old man's room in order to shine a sliver of light onto the \"evil eye\". However, the old man's vulture-eye is always closed, making it impossible to \"do the work\".\n\nOn the eighth night, the old man awakens after the narrator's hand slips and makes a noise, interrupting the narrator's nightly ritual. But the narrator does not draw back and, after some time, decides to open the lantern. A single thin ray of light shines out and lands precisely on the \"evil eye\", revealing that it is wide open. Hearing the old man's heart beating loudly and dangerously fast from terror, the narrator decides to strike, jumping out with a loud yell and smothering the old man with his own bed. The narrator then dismembers the body and conceals the pieces under the floorboards, and ensures the concealment of all signs of the crime. Even so, the old man's scream during the night causes a neighbor to report to the police, who the narrator invites in to look around. The narrator claims that the scream heard was the narrator's own in a nightmare and that the man is absent in the country. Confident that they will not find any evidence of the murder, the narrator brings chairs for them and they sit in the old man's room, on the very spot where the body is concealed, and suspect nothing, as the narrator has a pleasant and easy manner.\n\nThe narrator begins to feel uncomfortable and notices a ringing in the narrator's ears. As the ringing grows louder, the narrator comes to the conclusion that it is the heartbeat of the old man coming from under the floorboards. The sound increases steadily, though the officers seem to pay no attention to it. Terrified by the violent beating of the heart, and convinced that the officers are aware not only of the heartbeat but also of the narrator's guilt, the narrator breaks down and confesses, telling them to tear up the floorboards to reveal the remains of the old man's body.\n\n== Publication history ==\n[[File:Tell tale heart in pioneer.jpg|thumb|\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" in ''The Pioneer: A Literary and Critical Magazine'', page 29]]\n\"The Tell-Tale Heart\" was first published in January 1843 in the inaugural issue of ''The Pioneer: A Literary and Critical Magazine'', a short-lived [[Boston]] magazine edited by [[James Russell Lowell]] and [[Robert Carter (editor)|Robert Carter]] who were listed as the \"proprietors\" on the front cover. The magazine was published in Boston by Leland and Whiting and in Philadelphia by Drew and Scammell.\n\nPoe was likely paid $10 for the story.<ref name=\"Silverman-p201\">Silverman, Kenneth.

The exactness with which the narrator recounts murdering the old man, as if the stealthy way in which they executed the crime were evidence of their sanity, reveals their [[monomania]] and [[paranoia]]. The focus of the story is the perverse scheme to commit the [[perfect crime]].<ref>Kennedy, J. Gerald. ''Poe, Death, and the Life of Writing''. Yale University Press, 1987. p. 132; {{ISBN|0-300-03773-2}}</ref>\n\nThe narrator of \"The Tell-Tale Heart\" is generally assumed to be a male. However, some critics have suggested a woman may be narrating; no pronouns are used to clarify one way or the other.<ref name=Sova234>Sova, Dawn B. ''Edgar Allan Poe: A to Z''. New York City: Checkmark Books, 2001: 234. {{ISBN|0-8160-4161-X}}</ref> The story starts ''[[in medias res]]''. The story opens with a conversation already in progress between the narrator and another person who is not identified in any way. It has been speculated that the narrator is confessing to a prison warden, a judge, a reporter, a doctor or ([[Anachronism|anachronistically]]) a psychiatrist.<ref name=\"Benfey-p30\">[[Christopher Benfey|Benfey, Christopher]]. \"Poe and the Unreadable: 'The Black Cat' and 'The Tell-Tale Heart'\", in ''New Essays on Poe's Major Tales'', Kenneth Silverman, ed.

This, however, is self-destructive, because in attempting to prove their sanity, they fully admit that they are guilty of murder.<ref name=\"Robinson-p94\">Robinson, E.

Despite this, they say, the idea of murder \"haunted me day and night.\"<ref name=\"Robinson-p94\"/>\n\nThe story's final scene shows the result of the narrator's feelings of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]]. Like many characters in [[Gothic fiction]], they allow their nerves to dictate their nature.

A similar [[motif (narrative)|motif]] is used for Roderick Usher in \"[[The Fall of the House of Usher]]\" (1839) and in \"The Colloquy of Monos and Una\" (1841).<ref name=\"Reilly\"/> It is unclear, however, if the narrator actually has very [[:wikt:acute|acute]] senses, or if they are merely imagining things. If their condition is believed to be true, what they hear at the end of the story may not be the old man's heart, but [[deathwatch beetle]]s. The narrator first admits to hearing beetles in the wall after startling the old man from his sleep. According to superstition, deathwatch beetles are a sign of impending death. One variety of deathwatch beetle raps its head against surfaces, presumably as part of a mating ritual, while others emit ticking sounds.<ref name=\"Reilly\">Reilly, John E. \"[http://www.eapoe.org/papers/misc1990/jer19691.htm The Lesser Death-Watch and \"'The Tell-Tale Heart'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091218172125/http://www.eapoe.org/papers/misc1990/jer19691.htm |date=December 18, 2009 }}\", in ''The American Transcendental Quarterly''.

Their names, occupations, and places of residence are not given, contrasting with the strict attention to detail in the plot.<ref name=\"Benfey-p32\">Benfey, ''New Essays'', p. 32.</ref> The narrator may be a servant of the old man's or, as is more often assumed, his child. In that case, the \"vulture-eye\" of the old man as a father figure may symbolize parental surveillance, or the paternal principles of right and wrong. The murder of the eye, then, is a removal of conscience.<ref name=\"Hoffman-p223\">Hoffman, Daniel. ''Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe''.

It was released worldwide for [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] on February 23, 2016, and for [[Microsoft Windows]] on March 1, 2016. The game is a spin-off of the main ''[[Far Cry]]'' series. It is the first ''Far Cry'' game set in pre-modern times. It revolves around the story of Takkar, who starts off as an unarmed hunter and rises to become the leader of a tribe.\n\n''Far Cry Primal'' received generally positive reception from critics, who mostly praised the concept and setting, as well as the animal-taming mechanic and world design. Some reviewers felt there was a lack of weapons for the player to utilize, leading to repetitive gameplay design, while others felt the story and characters were not on par with the previous ''Far Cry'' games.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Far Cry Primal (2016) - Screenshot (Tame).jpg|left|thumb|In ''Far Cry Primal'', the player has the ability to tame animals for use in combat.]]\n''Far Cry Primal'' is an [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] game set in an [[open world]] environment and played from a [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]]. As the game is set in prehistoric times, the traditional gunplay and vehicle gameplay featured in the [[Far Cry|''Far Cry'' series]] were removed,<ref name=\"GRadar1\"/> and the player can only get access to melee weapons such as spears, clubs and ranged weapons such as bows and slings.<ref name=\"GI\"/> The player cannot purchase weapons and must craft them using the materials scavenged in the world such as wood and stone. As the player progresses, they can craft more lethal weapons with a larger variety of resources. \n\nBesides facing natural predators, the player must also compete with other hostile tribes occupying the area. By attacking and seizing bonfires and camps, the Wenja tribe will move in and begin patrolling the nearby region, and the player will gain fast travel points as well as camps to rest in. [[Non-player characters]] will also task the player to rescue tribe-mates and perform other tasks which improve the village, as well as provide free crafting materials. The game also features a dynamic weather system and day-night cycle, which affects the gameplay.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/far-cry-primal-officially-unveiled-coming-in-early-2016/|title=Far Cry Primal officially unveiled, coming in early 2016|first=Andy|last=Chalk|work=[[PC Gamer]]|date=October 7, 2015|accessdate=October 7, 2015}}</ref> At night, more predators are present, and many become more aggressive and dangerous, whereas at the day, the player can gather food and scavenge other resources such as tools for hunting.

Resigned to proceed alone, Takkar meets Sayla (Cara Ricketts), a Wenja gatherer whose life he saves, and once they arrive at Oros, Sayla informs Takkar that the Wenja are scattered and homeless across the land after their village was destroyed by Ull (DeLaRosa Rivera), leader of the [[Neanderthal]]-like Udam tribe who live in the northern mountains, prize warfare and hunting, and frequently kidnap Wenja to cannibalize them. Takkar then starts gathering the Wenja he meets around his cave, eventually encountering the wolf [[shaman]] Tensay ([[Terrence C. Carson]]), who helps him to learn the ability to tame the local animals. Tensay dubs Takkar the \"Beast Master\" for his skill.\n\nAfter repelling an Udam attack led by Ull on his newly established village, Takkar enlists the help of three other skilled Wenja: Jayma ([[Ayisha Issa]]), a veteran huntress, Wogah (Ron Kennell), a one-armed craftsman, and Karoosh (Nicolas Van Burek), a one-eyed warrior with his own vendetta against the Udam. With the help of Tensay, Takkar discovers that the Udam are eating Wenja flesh in hopes of gaining immunity from a terminal genetic disease, the \"skull fire\", that is wiping out their tribe, then tracks down and apprehends the Udam commander Dah (Juan Carlos Velis) to learn more about the Udam's techniques. Several Wenja reject Takkar's decision to give shelter to an Udam warrior at first, and take him to a cave to be executed by drowning, until Takkar himself arrives in time to rescue Dah and chastise the tribe for disobeying him, earning Dah's gratitude and help. When the agrarian, ritualistic Izila, another, more advanced tribe that lives in the marshlands of southern Oros, begin capturing Wenja prisoners for slavery and human sacrifice to the Sun goddess Suxli, Takkar invades their domains to rescue them, coming face to face with their leader Batari ([[Debra Wilson]]). After he refuses to become Batari's slave, a war begins between the Wenja and Izila. Takkar then infiltrates the camp of an Izila commander named Roshani (Ali Momen) and captures him, allowing him to live in exchange for sharing Izila technology in both warfare and agriculture.\n\nAfter preparing himself enough to face Ull and Batari, Takkar storms the Udam and Izila's main fortresses, passing by all opposition before confronting and killing their commanders. While the defiant Batari is burned alive during a solar eclipse, Ull urges Takkar to take care of his two children with his dying breath, which Takkar accepts, taking them with him back to his village. With both rival tribes defeated and Wenja dominance secured, Roshani agrees to stay with the Wenja and teach them how to grow food, while Takkar reluctantly agrees to mercifully kill Dah, ending his suffering from disease.

He also felt that the animal companion mechanic was one of the game's strongest elements, saying that it has \"limitless potential\". In regard to the choice of setting, he felt it was a welcome and natural evolution in the ''Far Cry'' series. However, he described the story as being familiar and predictable and said that, even with the drastic change of setting, the ''Far Cry'' formula isn't as innovative as it once was.<ref name=\"Destructoid review\"/>\n\nMatt Buchholtz of [[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] wrote, \"The graphics are stunning\u2014Ubisoft has truly mastered facial animations and lighting effects.\" He added, \"The game feels like a full-priced reskin of ''Far Cry 4'', without the engaging storyline\", finishing with, \"''Far Cry Primal'' really wants you to know that there are tons of things you can do in its prehistoric, open world. Unfortunately, you may not want to do any of them.\"<ref name=\"EGM review\"/>\n\nJeff Cork from [[Game Informer]] praised the setting for allowing for gameplay and story elements with more realism, specifically in regard to the protagonist not being a stereotype young male who inexplicably has advanced combat knowledge. He called the visuals and world design \"beautiful\", and said that the decision to use a primitive language made specifically for the game was \"effective\". Lastly, Cork wrote: \"Players who associate ''Far Cry'' with explosions and massive gunfights might find the setting disappointing, but it's one of my favorite entries in the series yet.\"<ref name=\"Game Informer review\"/>\n\nMatt Utley of [[Game Revolution]] called ''Far Cry Primal'' a \"breath of fresh air for both the franchise and first-person action games in general\". He praised the decision to remove guns and motorized vehicles for enabling more dynamic gameplay, called the graphics \"lush\" and \"evocative\", and, like others, commended the bold setting change. Utley's critiques were minor; he disliked some aspects of the control scheme, found that the quieter moments of the game were drowned-out by aggressive enemies, and felt that not enough improvements and fixes were made to the basic ''Far Cry'' formula.<ref name=\"Game Revolution review\"/>\n\nMike Mahardy of [[GameSpot]] gave the game a mostly positive review, calling the setting its greatest strength. He praised the open world for being \"cohesive\" and \"foreboding\", enjoyed the \"tense\" focus on survival, and called the beast-taming mechanics \"creative\". Mahardy did feel as though there was a limited amount of weapons given to the player and disliked some of the gameplay for being \"repetitive\".<ref name=\"GameSpot review\"/>\n\nJoe Skrebels from [[GamesRadar]] was more critical of the game, summarizing his thoughts with: \"''Primal'' takes the great structure of the ''Far Cry'' series, but little of its character. No clear goal and a limited arsenal end up making this feel a little prehistoric itself.\" Skrebels too praised the taming mechanic and the open world design.<ref name=\"GamesRadar review\"/>\n\nLuke Reilly of [[IGN]] summarized his review with: \"''Far Cry Primal'' comes to the table with a quiver of neat ideas but it forgot to bring much of a story with it.\" Reilly thought the game's strongest aspects were created by its twist on the series' formula, highlighting the scavenging elements and the animal-taming mechanics. However, Reilly felt the drastic change for the series wasn't without its flaws, saying that the characters, quests, and overall story were a step back from the memorable moments of the previous games.<ref name=\"IGN review\"/>\n\n[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'s [[Justin McElroy]] particularly praised the open world environment, calling it the \"most immersive\" in the series. He summarized his review by writing: \"I don't want every ''Far Cry'' game from here on to trade bullets for arrows, motorcycles for tigers, but ''Primal'' is an invigorating example of how to re-imagine a tired franchise while keeping its soul intact.\"<ref name=\"Polygon review\"/>\n\nEven though he described the game as being \"very fun\" and felt that the decision to develop a spin-off-type game in the series was a great one, Simon Miller from VideoGamer.com recognized that ''Far Cry Primal'' \"doesn't do anything drastically new\" for the series. He too praised the animal taming mechanic and the visuals.<ref name=\"VideoGamer.com review\"/>\n\n=== Sales ===\nThe retail version was the best selling game in its week of release in the UK, debuting at No. 1 in the UK retail software sales chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/far-cry-primal-conquers-uk-sales-chart/1100-6435171/|title=Far Cry Primal Conquers UK Sales Chart|first=Tamoor|last=Hussain|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=February 29, 2016|accessdate=March 1, 2016}}</ref> It was also the best-selling game in the United States in February 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/top-ten-best-selling-games-in-the-us-for-february-/1100-6435545/|title=Top Ten Best-Selling Games in the US for February 2016|first=Eddie|last=Makuch|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=March 10, 2016|accessdate=March 11, 2016}}</ref> According to Ubisoft, the game performed better than they had expected, and that its release became the biggest launch of a game in February.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2016/5/12/11664974/the-division-far-cry-primal-ubisoft-sales-performance|title=The Division hits 9.5M players while Far Cry Primal sets a February sales record (update)|first=Samit|last=Sarker|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=May 12, 2016|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category}}\n\n*{{Official website|http://far-cry.ubisoft.com/primal/en-us/home/}}\n\n{{Far Cry series}}\n\n[[Category:2016 video games]]\n[[Category:Far Cry]]\n[[Category:First-person shooters]]\n[[Category:Hunting video games]]\n[[Category:Open world video games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation 4 games]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric people in popular culture]]\n[[Category:Ubisoft games]]\n[[Category:Video games scored by Jason Graves]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in Canada]]\n[[Category:Video games featuring female antagonists]]\n[[Category:Video games set in prehistory]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Europe]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n[[Category:Xbox One games]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=February 2016}}\n{{Infobox video game\n| title = Far Cry Primal \n| image = Far Cry Primal cover art.jpg\n| developer = [[Ubisoft Montreal]]{{efn|Additional work by [[Ubisoft Toronto]], [[Ubisoft Shanghai]] and [[Ubisoft Kiev]].}}\n| publisher = [[Ubisoft]]\n| director = {{Unbulleted list|Jean-Christophe Guyot|Thomas Simon}}\n| producer = Vincent Pontbriand\n| programmer = {{Unbulleted list|David Robillard|Jean-Philippe Harvey}}\n| artist = Mickael Labat\n| writer = {{Unbulleted list|Jean-S\u00e9bastien Decant|Ian Ryan|Kevin Shortt}}\n| composer = [[Jason Graves]]\n| series = ''[[Far Cry]]''\n| engine =\n| platforms = {{Unbulleted list|[[PlayStation 4]]|[[Xbox One]]|[[Microsoft Windows]]}}\n| released = {{Unbulleted list|'''PlayStation 4''', '''Xbox One'''|February 23, 2016|'''Microsoft Windows'''|March 1, 2016}}\n| genre = [[First-person shooter]]\n| modes = [[Single-player video game|Single-player]]\n}}\n\n'''''Far Cry Primal''''' is a [[first-person shooter]] [[video game]] developed by [[Ubisoft Montreal]] and published by [[Ubisoft]]. It was released worldwide for [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] on February 23, 2016, and for [[Microsoft Windows]] on March 1, 2016. The game is a spin-off of the main ''[[Far Cry]]'' series. It is the first ''Far Cry'' game set in pre-modern times. It revolves around the story of Takkar, who starts off as an unarmed hunter and rises to become the leader of a tribe.\n\n''Far Cry Primal'' received generally positive reception from critics, who mostly praised the concept and setting, as well as the animal-taming mechanic and world design. Some reviewers felt there was a lack of weapons for the player to utilize, leading to repetitive gameplay design, while others felt the story and characters were not on par with the previous ''Far Cry'' games.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Far Cry Primal (2016) - Screenshot (Tame).jpg|left|thumb|In ''Far Cry Primal'', the player has the ability to tame animals for use in combat.]]\n''Far Cry Primal'' is an [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] game set in an [[open world]] environment and played from a [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]].

Takkar then starts gathering the Wenja he meets around his cave, eventually encountering the wolf [[shaman]] Tensay ([[Terrence C. Carson]]), who helps him to learn the ability to tame the local animals. Tensay dubs Takkar the \"Beast Master\" for his skill.\n\nAfter repelling an Udam attack led by Ull on his newly established village, Takkar enlists the help of three other skilled Wenja: Jayma ([[Ayisha Issa]]), a veteran huntress, Wogah (Ron Kennell), a one-armed craftsman, and Karoosh (Nicolas Van Burek), a one-eyed warrior with his own vendetta against the Udam. With the help of Tensay, Takkar discovers that the Udam are eating Wenja flesh in hopes of gaining immunity from a terminal genetic disease, the \"skull fire\", that is wiping out their tribe, then tracks down and apprehends the Udam commander Dah (Juan Carlos Velis) to learn more about the Udam's techniques. Several Wenja reject Takkar's decision to give shelter to an Udam warrior at first, and take him to a cave to be executed by drowning, until Takkar himself arrives in time to rescue Dah and chastise the tribe for disobeying him, earning Dah's gratitude and help. When the agrarian, ritualistic Izila, another, more advanced tribe that lives in the marshlands of southern Oros, begin capturing Wenja prisoners for slavery and human sacrifice to the Sun goddess Suxli, Takkar invades their domains to rescue them, coming face to face with their leader Batari ([[Debra Wilson]]). After he refuses to become Batari's slave, a war begins between the Wenja and Izila. Takkar then infiltrates the camp of an Izila commander named Roshani (Ali Momen) and captures him, allowing him to live in exchange for sharing Izila technology in both warfare and agriculture.\n\nAfter preparing himself enough to face Ull and Batari, Takkar storms the Udam and Izila's main fortresses, passing by all opposition before confronting and killing their commanders. While the defiant Batari is burned alive during a solar eclipse, Ull urges Takkar to take care of his two children with his dying breath, which Takkar accepts, taking them with him back to his village. With both rival tribes defeated and Wenja dominance secured, Roshani agrees to stay with the Wenja and teach them how to grow food, while Takkar reluctantly agrees to mercifully kill Dah, ending his suffering from disease. Takkar then joins Sayla and Tensay in a celebration of his victory with the other villagers.\n\nIn the post-credits, Ull's daughter appears taming a cave bear, implying that she has acquired Takkar's animal taming skills.\n\n== Development ==\nThe development of ''Far Cry Primal'' was led by [[Ubisoft Montreal]], with assistance provided by [[Ubisoft Toronto]], [[Ubisoft Kiev]] and [[Ubisoft Shanghai]].<ref name=\"IGN\"/> When asked about whether ''[[Far Cry 4]]'' would feature standalone content like ''[[Far Cry 3]]'' with ''[[Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon|Blood Dragon]]'', creative director Alex Hutchinson declared that a sequel to the game would not be happening, however they are planning something that can \"surprise\" players.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/blood-dragon-2-not-happening-says-far-cry-4-dev/1100-6423477/|title=Blood Dragon 2 Not Happening, Says Far Cry 4 Dev|first=Rob|last=Crossley|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=November 10, 2014|accessdate=October 7, 2015}}</ref> On January 5, 2015, Ubisoft released a survey and asked players about their favorite ''Far Cry'' setting.

He also felt that the animal companion mechanic was one of the game's strongest elements, saying that it has \"limitless potential\". In regard to the choice of setting, he felt it was a welcome and natural evolution in the ''Far Cry'' series. However, he described the story as being familiar and predictable and said that, even with the drastic change of setting, the ''Far Cry'' formula isn't as innovative as it once was.<ref name=\"Destructoid review\"/>\n\nMatt Buchholtz of [[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] wrote, \"The graphics are stunning\u2014Ubisoft has truly mastered facial animations and lighting effects.\" He added, \"The game feels like a full-priced reskin of ''Far Cry 4'', without the engaging storyline\", finishing with, \"''Far Cry Primal'' really wants you to know that there are tons of things you can do in its prehistoric, open world. Unfortunately, you may not want to do any of them.\"<ref name=\"EGM review\"/>\n\nJeff Cork from [[Game Informer]] praised the setting for allowing for gameplay and story elements with more realism, specifically in regard to the protagonist not being a stereotype young male who inexplicably has advanced combat knowledge. He called the visuals and world design \"beautiful\", and said that the decision to use a primitive language made specifically for the game was \"effective\". Lastly, Cork wrote: \"Players who associate ''Far Cry'' with explosions and massive gunfights might find the setting disappointing, but it's one of my favorite entries in the series yet.\"<ref name=\"Game Informer review\"/>\n\nMatt Utley of [[Game Revolution]] called ''Far Cry Primal'' a \"breath of fresh air for both the franchise and first-person action games in general\". He praised the decision to remove guns and motorized vehicles for enabling more dynamic gameplay, called the graphics \"lush\" and \"evocative\", and, like others, commended the bold setting change. Utley's critiques were minor; he disliked some aspects of the control scheme, found that the quieter moments of the game were drowned-out by aggressive enemies, and felt that not enough improvements and fixes were made to the basic ''Far Cry'' formula.<ref name=\"Game Revolution review\"/>\n\nMike Mahardy of [[GameSpot]] gave the game a mostly positive review, calling the setting its greatest strength. He praised the open world for being \"cohesive\" and \"foreboding\", enjoyed the \"tense\" focus on survival, and called the beast-taming mechanics \"creative\". Mahardy did feel as though there was a limited amount of weapons given to the player and disliked some of the gameplay for being \"repetitive\".<ref name=\"GameSpot review\"/>\n\nJoe Skrebels from [[GamesRadar]] was more critical of the game, summarizing his thoughts with: \"''Primal'' takes the great structure of the ''Far Cry'' series, but little of its character. No clear goal and a limited arsenal end up making this feel a little prehistoric itself.\" Skrebels too praised the taming mechanic and the open world design.<ref name=\"GamesRadar review\"/>\n\nLuke Reilly of [[IGN]] summarized his review with: \"''Far Cry Primal'' comes to the table with a quiver of neat ideas but it forgot to bring much of a story with it.\" Reilly thought the game's strongest aspects were created by its twist on the series' formula, highlighting the scavenging elements and the animal-taming mechanics. However, Reilly felt the drastic change for the series wasn't without its flaws, saying that the characters, quests, and overall story were a step back from the memorable moments of the previous games.<ref name=\"IGN review\"/>\n\n[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'s [[Justin McElroy]] particularly praised the open world environment, calling it the \"most immersive\" in the series. He summarized his review by writing: \"I don't want every ''Far Cry'' game from here on to trade bullets for arrows, motorcycles for tigers, but ''Primal'' is an invigorating example of how to re-imagine a tired franchise while keeping its soul intact.\"<ref name=\"Polygon review\"/>\n\nEven though he described the game as being \"very fun\" and felt that the decision to develop a spin-off-type game in the series was a great one, Simon Miller from VideoGamer.com recognized that ''Far Cry Primal'' \"doesn't do anything drastically new\" for the series. He too praised the animal taming mechanic and the visuals.<ref name=\"VideoGamer.com review\"/>\n\n=== Sales ===\nThe retail version was the best selling game in its week of release in the UK, debuting at No. 1 in the UK retail software sales chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/far-cry-primal-conquers-uk-sales-chart/1100-6435171/|title=Far Cry Primal Conquers UK Sales Chart|first=Tamoor|last=Hussain|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=February 29, 2016|accessdate=March 1, 2016}}</ref> It was also the best-selling game in the United States in February 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/top-ten-best-selling-games-in-the-us-for-february-/1100-6435545/|title=Top Ten Best-Selling Games in the US for February 2016|first=Eddie|last=Makuch|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=March 10, 2016|accessdate=March 11, 2016}}</ref> According to Ubisoft, the game performed better than they had expected, and that its release became the biggest launch of a game in February.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2016/5/12/11664974/the-division-far-cry-primal-ubisoft-sales-performance|title=The Division hits 9.5M players while Far Cry Primal sets a February sales record (update)|first=Samit|last=Sarker|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=May 12, 2016|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category}}\n\n*{{Official website|http://far-cry.ubisoft.com/primal/en-us/home/}}\n\n{{Far Cry series}}\n\n[[Category:2016 video games]]\n[[Category:Far Cry]]\n[[Category:First-person shooters]]\n[[Category:Hunting video games]]\n[[Category:Open world video games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation 4 games]]\n[[Category:Prehistoric people in popular culture]]\n[[Category:Ubisoft games]]\n[[Category:Video games scored by Jason Graves]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in Canada]]\n[[Category:Video games featuring female antagonists]]\n[[Category:Video games set in prehistory]]\n[[Category:Video games set in Europe]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n[[Category:Xbox One games]]\n", "name_user": "99.254.11.154", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eSetting)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_Cry_Primal"}

Lavoisier defined an element as a substance that cannot be broken down into a simpler substance by a chemical reaction.<ref>Lavoisier with Robert Kerr, trans. (1790) ''Elements of Chemistry''. Edinburgh, Scotland: William Creech. [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=gri.ark:/13960/t5v735k9h;view=1up;seq=30 From p. xxiv:] \"I shall therefore only add upon this subject, that if, by the term ''elements'', we mean to express those simple and indivisible atoms of which matter is composed, it is extremely probable we know nothing at all about them; but, if we apply the term ''elements'', or ''principles of bodies'', to express our idea of the last point which analysis is capable of reaching, we must admit, as elements, all substances into which we are capable, by any means, to reduce bodies by decomposition. Not that we are entitled to affirm, that these substances we consider as simple may not be compounded of two, or even of a greater number of principles; but, since these principles cannot be separated, or rather since we have not hitherto discovered means of separating them, they act with regard to us as simple substances, and we ought never to suppose them compounded until experiment and observation has proved them to be so.\"</ref> This simple definition served for a century and lasted until the discovery of [[subatomic particle]]s. Lavoisier's book contained a list of \"simple substances\" that Lavoisier believed could not be broken down further, which included [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], [[hydrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[zinc]] and [[sulfur]], which formed the basis for the modern list of elements. Lavoisier's list also included '[[light]]' and '[[Caloric theory|caloric]]', which at the time were believed to be material substances. He classified these substances into metals and non metals. While many leading [[chemist]]s refused to believe Lavoisier's new revelations, the ''Elementary Treatise'' was written well enough to convince the younger generation. However, Lavoisier's descriptions of his elements lack completeness, as he only classified them as metals and non-metals.\n\nIn 1815, the English physician and chemist [[William Prout]] noticed that atomic weights seemed to be multiples of that of hydrogen.<ref>See:\n\n* {{cite journal|last1=Prout|first1=William|date=November 1815|title=On the relation between the specific gravities of bodies in their gaseous state and the weights of their atoms|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433062744812;view=1up;seq=351|journal=Annals of Philosophy|volume=6|pages=321\u2013330}}\n* {{cite journal|last1=Prout|first1=William|date=February 1816|title=Correction of a mistake in the essay on the relation between the specific gravities of bodies in their gaseous state and the weights of their atoms|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433062744820;view=1up;seq=135|journal=Annals of Philosophy|volume=7|pages=111\u2013113}}</ref>\n\nIn 1817, [[Johann Wolfgang D\u00f6bereiner]], a chemist, I love animals.

However, Broek did not have any method to experimentally verify the atomic numbers of elements; thus, they were still believed to be a consequence of atomic weight, which remained in use in ordering elements.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nMoseley was determined to test Broek's hypothesis.<ref name=moseley2010/> After a year of investigation of the [[Fraunhofer lines]] of various elements, he found a relationship between the X-ray [[wavelength]] of an element and its atomic number.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Moseley|first1=H.G.J.|title=The high-frequency spectra of the elements|journal=Philosophical Magazine|date=1914|volume=27|pages=703\u2013713|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x002266051;view=1up;seq=731|series=6th series|doi=10.1080/14786440408635141}}</ref> With this, Moseley obtained the first accurate measurements of atomic numbers and determined an absolute sequence to the elements, allowing him to restructure the periodic table. Moseley's research immediately resolved discrepancies between atomic weight and chemical properties, where sequencing strictly by atomic weight would result in groups with inconsistent chemical peroperties. For example, his measurements of X-ray wavelengths enabled him to correctly place [[argon]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;18) before [[potassium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;19), [[cobalt]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;27) before [[nickel]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;28), as well as [[tellurium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;52) before [[iodine]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;53), in line with [[periodic trends]]. The determination of atomic numbers also clarified the order of chemically similar rare earth elements; it was also used to confirm that [[Georges Urbain]]'s claimed discovery of a new rare earth element ([[celtium]]) was invalid, earning Moseley acclamation for this technique.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nSwedish physicist [[Karl Siegbahn]] continued Moseley's work for elements heavier than gold (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;79), and found that the heaviest known element at the time, [[uranium]], had atomic number 92. In determining the largest identified atomic number, gaps in the atomic number sequence were conclusively determined where an atomic number had no known corresponding element; the gaps occurred at atomic numbers 43, 61, 72, 75, 85, and 87.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nIn the 1910s and 1920s, pioneering research into [[quantum mechanics]] led to new developments in atomic theory and small changes to the periodic table. The [[Bohr model]] was developed during this time, and championed the idea of [[electron configuration]]s that determine chemical properties.

This proposition, based upon the work of American chemist [[Gilbert N.

Not that we are entitled to affirm, that these substances we consider as simple may not be compounded of two, or even of a greater number of principles; but, since these principles cannot be separated, or rather since we have not hitherto discovered means of separating them, they act with regard to us as simple substances, and we ought never to suppose them compounded until experiment and observation has proved them to be so.\"</ref> This simple definition served for a century and lasted until the discovery of [[subatomic particle]]s.

He correctly determined the atomic number of all elements up to atomic number 50 ([[tin]]), though he made several errors with heavier elements. However, Broek did not have any method to experimentally verify the atomic numbers of elements; thus, they were still believed to be a consequence of atomic weight, which remained in use in ordering elements.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nMoseley was determined to test Broek's hypothesis.<ref name=moseley2010/> After a year of investigation of the [[Fraunhofer lines]] of various elements, he found a relationship between the X-ray [[wavelength]] of an element and its atomic number.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Moseley|first1=H.G.J.|title=The high-frequency spectra of the elements|journal=Philosophical Magazine|date=1914|volume=27|pages=703\u2013713|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x002266051;view=1up;seq=731|series=6th series|doi=10.1080/14786440408635141}}</ref> With this, Moseley obtained the first accurate measurements of atomic numbers and determined an absolute sequence to the elements, allowing him to restructure the periodic table. Moseley's research immediately resolved discrepancies between atomic weight and chemical properties, where sequencing strictly by atomic weight would result in groups with inconsistent chemical peroperties. For example, his measurements of X-ray wavelengths enabled him to correctly place [[argon]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;18) before [[potassium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;19), [[cobalt]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;27) before [[nickel]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;28), as well as [[tellurium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;52) before [[iodine]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;53), in line with [[periodic trends]]. The determination of atomic numbers also clarified the order of chemically similar rare earth elements; it was also used to confirm that [[Georges Urbain]]'s claimed discovery of a new rare earth element ([[celtium]]) was invalid, earning Moseley acclamation for this technique.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nSwedish physicist [[Karl Siegbahn]] continued Moseley's work for elements heavier than gold (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;79), and found that the heaviest known element at the time, [[uranium]], had atomic number 92. In determining the largest identified atomic number, gaps in the atomic number sequence were conclusively determined where an atomic number had no known corresponding element; the gaps occurred at atomic numbers 43, 61, 72, 75, 85, and 87.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nIn the 1910s and 1920s, pioneering research into [[quantum mechanics]] led to new developments in atomic theory and small changes to the periodic table. The [[Bohr model]] was developed during this time, and championed the idea of [[electron configuration]]s that determine chemical properties.

He explained the chemical properties of transition elements as a consequence of the filling of an inner subshell rather than the valence shell. This proposition, based upon the work of American chemist [[Gilbert N. Lewis]], suggested the appearance of the ''d'' subshell in period&nbsp;4 and the ''f''-subshell in period&nbsp;6, lengthening the periods from 8 to 18 and then 18 to 32 elements.<ref name=Jensen>{{cite journal |journal = Journal of Chemical Education |volume = 80 |issue = 8 |year = 2003 |url = http://www.uv.es/~borrasj/ingenieria_web/temas/tema_1/lecturas_comp/p952.pdf |title = The Place of Zinc, Cadmium, and Mercury in the Periodic Table |first = William B. |last = Jensen |pages=952\u2013961 |doi = 10.1021/ed080p952 |bibcode = 2003JChEd..80..952J }}</ref>\n\n==Looking for expansions and the end of the periodic table==\nAs early as 1913, Bohr's research on [[electronic structure]] led physicists such as [[Johannes Rydberg]] to extrapolate the properties of undiscovered elements heavier than uranium. Many agreed that the next noble gas after radon would most likely have the atomic number 118, from which it followed that the transition series in the [[period 7 element|seventh period]] should resemble those in the [[period 6 element|sixth]]. Although it was thought that these transition series would include a series analogous to the rare earth elements, characterized by filling of the 5f shell, it was unknown where this series began. Predictions ranged from atomic number 90 (thorium) to 99, many of which proposed a beginning beyond the known elements (at or beyond atomic number 93). The elements from [[actinium]] to uranium were instead believed to form part of a fourth series of transition metals because of their high [[oxidation state]]s; accordingly, they were placed in groups 3 through 6.<ref name=seaborg2>{{cite book |last=Seaborg |first=G. |title=Lanthanides/Actinides: Chemistry |chapter=Origin of the Actinide Concept |series=Handbook on the Physics and Chemistry of Rare Earths |volume=18 |edition=1 |date=1994 |isbn=9780444536648 |id=LBL-31179 |chapter-url=https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt7cz371hx/qt7cz371hx.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIn 1940, [[neptunium]] and [[plutonium]] were the first [[transuranic element]]s to be discovered; they were placed in sequence beneath [[rhenium]] and [[osmium]], respectively.

of Vietnam|Secretariat]] (abolished at the [[8th National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam|8th National Congress]]), and the retention of the Politburo Standing Committee while at the same time reviving the Secretariat.{{sfn|Thayer|2001|p=183}} After a visit to France, L\u00ea Kh\u1ea3 Phi\u00eau reportedly tried to amend the [[Constitution of Vietnam|state constitution]] and the [[Statutes of the Communist Party of Vietnam|CPV statutes]] to as to allow him to serve concurrently as general secretary and [[President of Vietnam|state president]].{{sfn|Thayer|2001|p=183}} His stewardship as general secretary was severely tested by rural unrest, the [[Asian financial crisis]], and the continued influence of the Advisors to the Central Committee, most prominently among them being [[\u0110\u1ed7 M\u01b0\u1eddi]], L\u00ea Kh\u1ea3 Phi\u00eau's predecessor as general secretary.{{sfn|Thayer|2001|p=183}} \u0110\u1ed7 M\u01b0\u1eddi still retained policy influence during L\u00ea Kh\u1ea3 Phi\u00eau's term in office, and while he was no longer a member of the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of Vietnam|Politburo]], he attended the meetings of the 8th Politburo.{{sfn|Thayer|2001|p=183}} He was appointed the convenor of the 9th National Congress, a post which gave him considerable influence over congress proceedings.{{sfn|Thayer|2001|p=183}} Anyway,

Phi\u00eau's leadership.{{sfn|Thayer|2001|p=183}}\n\nThe first session of the 11th plenum of the 8th Central Committee (held in January 2001), issued a statement which said that no one over the age of 65 could be re-elected to the Central Committee, or any other central party position.{{sfn|Abuza|2002|p=1}} However, after a hard-led counter-offensive by L\u00ea Kh\u1ea3 Phi\u00eau, another statement by the Central Committee was issued which stated that certain exceptions could be made by \"key cadres\".{{sfn|Abuza|2002|p=1}} L\u00ea Kh\u1ea3 Phi\u00eau pointed on a wave of demonstrations by ethnic minorities in the Central Highland in February 2001 for a reason to stay in office, so as to assure stability.{{sfn|Abuza|2002|p=1}} By the end of the second session of the 11th plenum it looked to outsiders that his position was secure.{{sfn|Abuza|2002|p=1}} In a mid-April Politburo meeting, two-thirds of its members voted to retain L\u00ea Kh\u1ea3 Phi\u00eau as general secretary, but on 17 April at the 12th plenum the Central Committee overturned the politburo's decision (in itself a very rare event) and voted to oust him from office.{{sfn|Abuza|2002|p=1}}\n\n===Documents===\nAt the 9th plenum of the 8th Central Committee, attended by the advisors to the Central Committee, discussed the drafting of four documents; the

Statutes.{{sfn|Thayer|2001|p=184}} [[Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fa Tr\u1ecdng]], a member of the 8th Politburo and the Secretary of the [[Hanoi]] Party Committee, briefed the 9th plenum on the contentious matter that still needed to be discussed, such as sections of the Political Report and the need for further amendments to the party's statutes.{{sfn|Thayer|2001|p=184}} The 10th plenum of the 8th Central Committee (26 June \u2013 4 July), according to an official communique, \"laid the ground work for the 9th National Party Congress.\"{{sfn|Thayer|2001|p=184}} In the aftermath of the 10th

the Renovation Process, Accelerating Industrialization and Modernization, Building and Defending the Socialist Vietnamese Fatherland''.{{sfn|Thayer|2001|p=184}} The Political Report signalled no major changes from the political report given to the 8th National Congress.{{sfn|Thayer|2001|p=184}} However, there were some minor changes.{{sfn|Thayer|2001|p=184}} For instance, previously party documents had stated that the party and state's long term policy was \"to develop the commodity-based multi-sector economy operating in accordance with the state-managed, socialist-orientated market mechanism\", but the political report to the 9th National Congress condensed this into a single phrase, \"to develop a [[socialist-oriented market economy]].\"{{sfn|Thayer|2001|pp=184\u2013185}} The political report still gave prominence to [[Ho Chi Minh Thought|H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh Thought]], the [[Socialism (Marxism)|period of transition to socialism]] (which can be shortened by \"orderly steps and big leaps forward\"), the leading role given to the state and cooperatives in the economy, and [[class struggle]].{{sfn|Thayer|2001|p=185}} According to the Political Report, \"The principal content of class struggle is to successfully pursue the goal of industrialization and modernization along the lines of socialism, to struggle to frustrate all schemes and acts of sabotage by hostile forces, and to build Vietnam into a prosperous socialist country.\"{{sfn|Thayer|2001|p=185}}\n\n==Delegates==\nDuring the final quarter of 2000, and the beginning of 2001, party congresses were held

members).{{sfn|Thayer|2002|p=82}} Of these, 87 had been members of the 8th Central Committee, the rest, 63 in total, were new members.{{sfn|Thayer|2002|p=82}} The 9th Central Committee comprised primarily incumbent officials who held posts in either the [[Government of Vietnam|central government]] or were provincial leaders.{{sfn|Thayer|2002|pp=82\u201383}} [[L\u00ea Minh H\u01b0\u01a1ng]], a member of the [[9th Politburo of the Communist Party of Vietnam|9th Politburo]] and [[Ministry of Public Security (Vietnam)|Minister of Public Security]], led the five-member security bloc in the Central Committee, while [[L\u00ea H\u1ed3ng Anh]] was a prominent member of the bloc responsible for [[Ministry of Interior (Vietnam)|internal security]].{{sfn|Thayer|2002|p=83}} A third group, led by [[Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n An]], the head of the [[Central Organizing Commission of the Communist Party of Vietnam|Central Organizing and Personnel Commission]], led what Carlyle Thayer referred to as the \"personnel bloc\".{{sfn|Thayer|2002|p=83}}\n\nThe 1st plenum of the 9th Central Committee, held on 22 April, elected the 9th Politburo.{{sfn|Thayer|2002|p=83}} The 9th Politburo consisted of 15 members (the 8th Politburo had 19 members).{{sfn|Thayer|2002|p=83}} Nguy\u1ec5n T\u1ea5n D\u0169ng and [[Nguy\u1ec5n Minh Tri\u1ebft]], both considered reformers by outside observers, rose within the Politburo hierarchy, but so did L\u00ea Minh H\u01b0\u01a1ng and Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fa Tr\u1ecdng, who are labelled conservatives by outside observers.{{sfn|Thayer|2002|p=83}} L\u00ea H\u1ed3ng Anh, the [[Chairman of the Central Inspection Commission of the Communist Party of Vietnam|Chairman]] of the [[Central Inspection Commission of the Communist Party of Vietnam|Central Inspection Commission]], was a newcomer to the Politburo and was ranked ninth, \"above two incumbent members\".{{sfn|Thayer|2002|p=83}} Military representation within the Politburo was reduced from four members in the 8th Politburo to one, General [[Ph\u1ea1m V\u0103n Tr\u00e0]], in the 9th Politburo.{{sfn|Thayer|2002|p=83}} In contrast, military representation within the Central Committee increased overall from the 8th Central Committee, but with the majority of military members being incumbents.{{sfn|Thayer|2002|p=83}}\n\nThe Politburo Standing Committee and the Advisory Council to the Central Committee were abolished at the congress, and the Secretariat was reestablished.{{sfn|Thayer|2002|p=83}} The Secretariat was elected by the 1st plenum of the 9th Central Committee.{{sfn|Thayer|2002|p=83}} The abolishment of the Advisory Council effectively ended the behind-the-scenes influence of senior retirees.{{sfn|Thayer|2002|p=83}} The congress reaffirmed Vietnam's plans of accelerating industrialization and modernization in order to become a modern-industrialized state by 2020, and adopted the 7th Five-Year Plan and the Socioeconomic Strategy for the 2001\u20132010.{{sfn|Thayer|2002|p=84}} According to Carlyle Thayer, these documents \"called for self-reliance, mobilization of domestic capital, the development of Vietnam's comparative advantage, and attracting external resources in the form of foreign investment capital, new technology, and managerial expertise.\"{{sfn|Thayer|2002|p=84}} The Political Report stressed the need to retain good relations with fellow [[socialist state]]s and neighboring countries, while at the same time improving relations with the capitalist world.{{sfn|Thayer|2002|pp=86\u201387}}\n\nL\u00ea Kh\u1ea3

election to the general secretaryship, N\u00f4ng \u0110\u1ee9c M\u1ea1nh pledged to Hu Jintao that \"the relationship between Vietnam and China will develop better and better in the days to come.\"

1999 at the 7th plenum of the [[8th Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam|8th Central Committee]].{{sfn|Thayer|2001|p=181}} Preparatory work for the congress began at the 8th plenum of the 8th Central Committee \"by assigning various organizational tasks to senior party officials.\"{{sfn|Thayer|2001|p=181}} After the 8th plenum several officials lost their post because of either disciplinary cases, government reshuffling or reassignment within the party.{{sfn|Thayer|2001|p=181}} These changes were implemented because of widespread criticism of the [[Communist Party of Vietnam]]'s (CPV) tackling of corruption, and in order to strengthen the coherence of national policy and its implementation.{{sfn|Thayer|2001|p=182}} A statement issued by the 8th plenum stated that [[Ng\u00f4 Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c]], a [[Deputy Prime Minister of Vietnam|Deputy Prime Minister]], and [[Cao S\u0129 Ki\u00eam]], a party official working in the economic sector, had been given disciplinary warnings.{{sfn|Thayer|2001|p=182}} In addition, the 8th plenum recommended to dismiss Ng\u00f4 Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c as a Deputy Prime Minister because of implication in the [[Thanh Long amusement park scandal]].{{sfn|Thayer|2001|p=182}} Cao S\u0129 Ki\u00eam on the other hand was criticised for mismanaging loans that resulted in a sudden increase in bad debts.{{sfn|Thayer|2001|p=182}}\n\nIn December, the [[National Assembly (Vietnam)|National Assembly]] dismissed Ng\u00f4 Xu\u00e2n L\u1ed9c as Deputy Prime Ministers on the grounds of him being

\u0110\u1ee9c Th\u00fay]].{{sfn|Thayer|2001|p=182}} He was later made First Deputy Prime Minister and became responsible for supervising the works of the three other deputy prime ministers.{{sfn|Thayer|2001|p=182}} Late in January 2001, the [[Standing Committee of the National Assembly|Standing Committee]] of the National Assembly announced that [[Nguy\u1ec5n M\u1ea1nh

Vietnam's plans of accelerating industrialization and modernization in order to become a modern-industrialized state by 2020, and adopted the 7th Five-Year Plan and the Socioeconomic Strategy for the 2001\u20132010.{{sfn|Thayer|2002|p=84}} According to Carlyle Thayer, these documents \"called for self-reliance, mobilization of domestic capital, the development of Vietnam's comparative advantage, and attracting external resources in the form of foreign investment capital, new technology, and managerial expertise.\"{{sfn|Thayer|2002|p=84}} The Political Report stressed the need to retain good

election to the general secretaryship, N\u00f4ng \u0110\u1ee9c M\u1ea1nh pledged to Hu Jintao that \"the relationship between Vietnam and China will develop better and better in the days to come.\"

The right-back settled quickly, quietly going about his defensive duties until being spotted during the [[1991-92 in English football|1991\u201392]] season, accidentally, by Liverpool manager [[Graeme Souness]] who was at [[Gresty Road]] looking at a different player.

However, he was ruled out of England's [[UEFA Euro 1992|Euro 92]] squad due to shin splints.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/CmpEC/CmpEC1992Squad.html|title=England in the European Championship - 1992 Squad Records|first=Peter|last=Young|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nOver the next four seasons he was a regular member of the Liverpool starting line-up and in the sides that beat [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] 2\u20131 in the 1995 [[Football League Cup]] final and lost 1\u20130 to Man United in the [[1996 FA Cup Final]].\n\nWhen Liverpool signed midfielder [[Jason McAteer]], who arrived in [[1995-96 in English football|1995]], [[Roy Evans]] converted McAteer to right-back and employed Jones on the left-side in a [[Defender (association football)#Wingback|wingback]] role as Liverpool changed from their normal [[Formation (association football)|4\u20134\u20132]] to an attack-minded [[Formation (association football)|5\u20133\u20132]] formation.\n\nAfter the [[1996 FA Cup Final]], Jones was advised to take a six-month break from football due to back problems.

He was named in the side that began the [[1999 UEFA Intertoto Cup|Intertoto Cup]] third round second leg tie against [[FC Jokerit]], but was substituted after the first half as a result of aggravating his knee injury. This proved to be his last senior appearance, as he retired in August 1999.\n\n==International career==\nAt international level Jones was eligible to play for [[Wales national football team|Wales]], as he was born in Wrexham, but it was [[Graham Taylor (football manager)|Graham Taylor]] who selected him and gave him his international debut for [[England national football team|England]] in the 2\u20130 win over [[France national football team|France]] at Wembley on 19 February 1992 \u2013 just four months after he had made the move from Fourth Division football to the First Division.
