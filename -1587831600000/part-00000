It is the eighth installment in the [[DC Extended Universe]] and a follow-up to ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]'' (2016). It was directed by [[Cathy Yan]] and written by [[Christina Hodson]], and it stars [[Margot Robbie]], [[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]], [[Jurnee Smollett-Bell]], [[Rosie Perez]], [[Chris Messina]], [[Ella Jay Basco]], [[Ali Wong]], and [[Ewan McGregor]]. The film follows [[Harley Quinn]] as she joins forces with [[Huntress (Helena Bertinelli)|Helena Bertinelli]], [[Dinah Lance]], and [[Renee Montoya]] to save [[Cassandra Cain]] from [[Gotham City]] crime lord [[Black Mask (character)|Black Mask]].\n\nRobbie, who also served as producer, pitched the idea for ''Birds of Prey'' to [[Warner Bros.]] in 2015. The film was announced in May 2016, with Hodson being hired to write the script that November, followed by Yan signing on to direct in April 2018. The majority of the cast and crew were confirmed by December 2018. [[Principal photography]] lasted from January to April 2019 in [[Downtown Los Angeles]], parts of the [[Arts District, Los Angeles]], and soundstages at [[Warner Bros. Studios, Burbank|Warner Bros. Studios]] in [[Burbank, California]]. Additional filming took place in September 2019.\n\n''Birds of Prey'' is the first DCEU film and the second [[DC Films]] production to be [[R rating (Motion Picture Association of America)|rated R]] by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]]. The film had its world premiere in [[Mexico City]] on January 25, 2020, and was theatrically released in the United States in [[IMAX]], [[Dolby Cinema]], and [[4DX]] on February 7, 2020. It grossed $201 million worldwide, making it the [[2020 in film|fourth highest-grossing film of 2020]] but leaving it short of its widely reported [[break even]] point of $250-300 million.<ref name=\"VarietyBE\">{{Cite web |url=https://variety.com/2020/film/box-office/birds-of-prey-box-office-disappoints-1203498018/ |title=Why 'Birds of Prey' Whiffed at the Box Office |last=Rubin |first=Rebecca |date=February 10, 2020 |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |access-date=February 10, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/world/2020/?ref_=bo_cso_table_1|title=2020 Worldwide Box Office |website=[[Box Office Mojo]]|publisher=[[IMDb]]|accessdate=March 19, 2020}}</ref> The film received praise from critics for its visual style, Yan's direction, the performances of Robbie and McGregor, and Hodson's screenplay.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summary should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nAfter the [[Enchantress (DC Comics)|Enchantress]]' defeat,{{efn|Depicted in the 2016 film ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]''.}} the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] breaks up with [[Harley Quinn]], throwing her out on the streets of [[Gotham City]]. She is taken in by Doc, the owner of a Taiwanese restaurant, and recovers from her relationship by cutting her hair, adopting a [[spotted hyena]] (whom she names after [[Batman|Bruce Wayne]]), and taking up [[roller derby]].\n\nOne night, Harley gets drunk at a [[Clubbing (subculture)|nightclub]] owned by [[Black Mask (character)|Roman Sionis]] and cripples his driver after said driver insults her. She meets burlesque singer [[Black Canary|Dinah Lance]], who later rescues an intoxicated Harley from an attempted abduction. Roman is impressed by Dinah's skills and appoints her as his new driver. The next night, Harley blows up the Ace Chemicals plant as a way to publicly announce her and Joker's breakup. Meanwhile, [[Gotham City Police Department|GCPD]] Detective [[Renee Montoya]] investigates a series of mob killings carried out by a [[crossbow]]-wielding vigilante. Finding Harley's necklace at the scene of the Ace Chemicals explosion, Montoya notes that Harley is in danger without the Joker's protection. She approaches Dinah about being an informant on Roman for them, but Dinah rejects the offer.\n\nRoman sends Dinah and his sadistic right-hand-man [[Victor Zsasz]] to retrieve a diamond embedded with the account numbers to the fortune of the Bertinelli crime family, who were massacred years ago. Young pickpocket [[Cassandra Cain|Cassandra \"Cass\" Cain]] steals the diamond from Zsasz and swallows it after she is arrested. Harley, fleeing from Montoya and several other people she had wronged in the past, is captured by Roman's men. Zsasz informs Roman that Cassandra has the diamond, and Dinah warns Montoya about the situation. As Roman prepares to have Harley killed, she offers to recover the diamond for him. Roman agrees but also places a bounty on Cassandra. Breaking into the GCPD with a variety of [[Fireworks|firework]]-inspired [[Riot gun#Impact rounds|non-lethal grenade launcher rounds]], Harley frees Cassandra and the pair escape.\n\nAfter escaping, Harley and Cassandra bond while hiding out at the former's apartment. Doc is approached for information by the \"crossbow killer\", who is revealed to be [[Huntress (Helena Bertinelli)|Helena Bertinelli]]. Having survived her family's massacre and becoming trained as an assassin, Helena has been targeting each of the gangsters responsible for her family's murders, preferring the moniker of \"The Huntress\". Quinn's apartment is later bombed by criminals looking for Cassandra, and Doc sorrowfully reveals that he sold Harley out. Harley calls Roman and offers to turn Cassandra over in exchange for his protection, agreeing to meet at an abandoned amusement park. Dinah notifies Montoya of the rendezvous, but her betrayal is noticed by Zsasz, who informs Roman. A devastated Roman dons his ritualistic mask from which he gets his [[Pseudonym#Criminal activity|villainous nickname]], \"Black Mask\".\n\nAt the park, Montoya confronts Harley, but Harley knocks her out of a window. Zsasz arrives and tranquilizes Harley before holding Dinah at gunpoint, but he is killed by Helena, who reveals Zsasz was the last of her family's killers. Montoya returns and a stand-off ensues, until they realize Roman has arrived with a small army of masked criminals, known collectively as the [[Black Mask (character)#Fictional character biography|False Face Society]]. Using Quinn's old gear, the makeshift team successfully withstand and repel their attack. During the battle, Cassandra is captured by Roman, while Dinah reveals her [[metahuman]] ability of supersonic-level screaming, defeating an additional number of mobsters aligned with Roman. Harley gives chase on roller skates, and with assistance from Helena, the pair pursue Roman. At a nearby pier, the final confrontation occurs. Roman prepares to kill Cassandra, but she pulls the ring from a grenade that she slipped in his jacket after taking it from Harley's weapons chest earlier. Harley throws Roman off the pier just before the grenade detonates and kills him.\n\nIn the aftermath of destroying Roman's criminal empire, Montoya quits the GCPD.

Meanwhile, [[Gotham City Police Department|GCPD]] Detective [[Renee Montoya]] investigates a series of mob killings carried out by a [[crossbow]]-wielding vigilante.

Harley, fleeing from Montoya and several other people she had wronged in the past, is captured by Roman's men. Zsasz informs Roman that Cassandra has the diamond, and Dinah warns Montoya about the situation. As Roman prepares to have Harley killed, she offers to recover the diamond for him. Roman agrees but also places a bounty on Cassandra. Breaking into the GCPD with a variety of [[Fireworks|firework]]-inspired [[Riot gun#Impact rounds|non-lethal grenade launcher rounds]], Harley frees Cassandra and the pair escape.\n\nAfter escaping, Harley and Cassandra bond while hiding out at the former's apartment. Doc is approached for information by the \"crossbow killer\", who is revealed to be [[Huntress (Helena Bertinelli)|Helena Bertinelli]]. Having survived her family's massacre and becoming trained as an assassin, Helena has been targeting each of the gangsters responsible for her family's murders, preferring the moniker of \"The Huntress\". Quinn's apartment is later bombed by criminals looking for Cassandra, and Doc sorrowfully reveals that he sold Harley out. Harley calls Roman and offers to turn Cassandra over in exchange for his protection, agreeing to meet at an abandoned amusement park. Dinah notifies Montoya of the rendezvous, but her betrayal is noticed by Zsasz, who informs Roman. A devastated Roman dons his ritualistic mask from which he gets his [[Pseudonym#Criminal activity|villainous nickname]], \"Black Mask\".\n\nAt the park, Montoya confronts Harley, but Harley knocks her out of a window. Zsasz arrives and tranquilizes Harley before holding Dinah at gunpoint, but he is killed by Helena, who reveals Zsasz was the last of her family's killers. Montoya returns and a stand-off ensues, until they realize Roman has arrived with a small army of masked criminals, known collectively as the [[Black Mask (character)#Fictional character biography|False Face Society]]. Using Quinn's old gear, the makeshift team successfully withstand and repel their attack. During the battle, Cassandra is captured by Roman, while Dinah reveals her [[metahuman]] ability of supersonic-level screaming, defeating an additional number of mobsters aligned with Roman. Harley gives chase on roller skates, and with assistance from Helena, the pair pursue Roman. At a nearby pier, the final confrontation occurs. Roman prepares to kill Cassandra, but she pulls the ring from a grenade that she slipped in his jacket after taking it from Harley's weapons chest earlier. Harley throws Roman off the pier just before the grenade detonates and kills him.\n\nIn the aftermath of destroying Roman's criminal empire, Montoya quits the GCPD. With the money within the accounts hidden inside the diamond, she joins Dinah and Helena in establishing a team of [[vigilante]]s \u2013 the [[Birds of Prey (team)|Birds of Prey]]. Harley and Cassandra escape, selling the diamond itself to a pawnshop and starting their own [[contract killing]] business.\n\nIn a [[Post-credits scene|post-credits audio sequence]], Harley is about to reveal a secret about [[Batman]], but the film ends mid-sentence.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Margot Robbie]] as [[Harley Quinn|Harleen Quinzel / Harley Quinn]]: A former-certified [[psychiatrist]], who became a crazed criminal and the [[Joker (character)|Joker]]'s accomplice/girlfriend, and later a part of the [[Suicide Squad]].

Watsuki felt disgusted with the work and originally did not plan on revealing it, but ultimately decided to include ''Meteor Strike'' in the final ''Rurouni Kenshin'' volume to increase its page count. Although, he said that after reading the story over again it \"relaxed\" him \"in a nice way.\"<ref name=\"MeteroStrik\">Watsuki, Nobuhiro. ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]] Volume 28''. Viz Media. 155.</ref> Watsuki included three main elements in the story, which he described as having \"some different flavors\" than ''Rurouni Kenshin''. He had wanted to use meteors in a story for a long time, since they are the \"most energetic natural phenomena.\" His second element was a boy wearing a pair of white gloves. Watsuki described white gloves as \"sort of plain\" and \"not cool at all,\" yet he considers the element to be one of his favorites since the gloves \"give off a sense of strength.\" His third element is the girl wearing a construction site helmet. The helmet is masculine, while the [[Japanese school uniform]] that the girl wears is feminine.<ref name=\"MeteroStrik\"/> Watsuki said that he created the main character Shinya \"on the spot,\" giving him too much honesty, and a personality that overlaps with that of Himura Kenshin, which he regrets \"a little.\" Watsuki created Chiho, the other major character, to show the \"[[Sh\u014djo manga|shojo]] theme of the moment\" when the boy out-matures the girl. Watsuki felt that the plan \"didn't work out so well\" and \"a lot wasn't what I wanted it to be.\" He added that he liked portraying the \"helpful nature\" of Chiho.<ref name=\"MeteroStrik\"/>\n\nIn 2001, Watsuki created his second serialized work, the western ''[[Gun Blaze West]]''. The story follows Viu Bannes, a young gunfighter on his journey towards Gun Blaze West, the place where the greatest gunmen go to test their strength. It ran in ''Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump'' for less-than a year, from January 8 to August 13, 2001.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mediaarts-db.bunka.go.jp/mg/magazines/321715 |title=\u9031\u520a\u5c11\u5e74\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\u30002001/01/08\u3000\u8868\u793a\u53f7\u65702 |website=Media Arts Database |publisher=Agency for Cultural Affairs |language=Japanese |accessdate=2017-04-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://mediaarts-db.bunka.go.jp/mg/magazines/321685 |title=\u9031\u520a\u5c11\u5e74\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\u30002001/08/13\u3000\u8868\u793a\u53f7\u657035 |website=Media Arts Database |publisher=Agency for Cultural Affairs |language=Japanese |accessdate=2017-04-16}}</ref> Its three volumes were published in English by Viz.\n\nHis third serialization ''[[Buso Renkin]]'', was published in ''Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump'' between July 7, 2003 and May 9, 2005,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mediaarts-db.bunka.go.jp/mg/magazines/321591 |title=\u9031\u520a\u5c11\u5e74\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\u30002003/07/07\u3000\u8868\u793a\u53f7\u657030 |website=Media Arts Database |publisher=Agency for Cultural Affairs |language=Japanese |accessdate=2017-04-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://mediaarts-db.bunka.go.jp/mg/magazines/321499 |title=\u9031\u520a\u5c11\u5e74\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\u30002005/05/09\u30fb5/16\u5408\u4f75\u3000\u8868\u793a\u53f7\u657021\u30fb22 |website=Media Arts Database |publisher=Agency for Cultural Affairs |language=Japanese |accessdate=2017-04-16}}</ref> with two special chapters published in ''[[Akamaru Jump]]''.

Watsuki worked on Obata's ''Mashin B\u014dken Tan Lamp-Lamp'' and ''Chikara Bito Densetsu'',<ref name=\"Profiles\">{{cite book|title=Rurouni Kenshin Profiles|chapter=Rurouni Secrets|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|pages=185-191|year=2005|isbn=978-1-4215-0160-4}}</ref> the former's title character would later serve as a model for [[Sagara Sanosuke]].<ref name=\"Form\">Watsuki, Nobuhiro. \"The Secret Life of Characters (6) Sagara Sanosuke,\" ''Rurouni Kenshin'' Volume 2.

Set in the [[Sengoku Jidai]] era of Japan's warring states, ''Crescent Moon in the Warring States'' relates the tale of the lone swordsman [[Hiko Seij\u016br\u014d]]. The first ''Rurouni: Meiji Swordsman Romantic Story'' features [[Himura Kenshin]] stopping a crime lord from taking over the Kamiya family [[dojo]]. The second sees Kenshin saving a young girl who is being held ransom by fallen samurai.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mediaarts-db.bunka.go.jp/mg/magazines/322090 |title=\u9031\u520a\u5c11\u5e74\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\u30001993/05/10\u30fb5/17\u5408\u4f75\u3000\u8868\u793a\u53f7\u657021\u30fb22 |website=Media Arts Database |publisher=[[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] |language=Japanese |accessdate=2017-04-16}}</ref> These three works served as the basis for his first serial; ''[[Rurouni Kenshin|Rurouni Kenshin: Meiji Swordsman Romantic Story]]'', which follows the former [[hitokiri]] Himura Kenshin and was serialized in ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' from 1994 to 1999. It was a major success with over 70 million copies in circulation,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2014-05-01/top-20-most-popular-manga-ranked-by-publication-numbers|title= Top 20 Most Popular Manga Ranked By Publication Numbers|publisher= [[Anime News Network]]|date=2014-05-01|accessdate=2017-04-16}}</ref> and was adapted into an [[anime]] television, several animated films, and a trilogy of live-action films. The story ''Haru ni Sakura'', included in the ''Kenshin Kaden'' guidebook, details the fates of the main cast of ''Rurouni Kenshin'' following its conclusion. In ''Yahiko no Sakabat\u014d'', set five years after the conclusion of ''Rurouni Kenshin'', My\u014djin Yahiko must save the daughter of a dojo master from an old foe.\n\nDuring ''Rurouni Kenshin''{{'}}s serialization, Watsuki wrote ''Meteor Strike'', a one-shot written for a ''Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump'' artists project. It chronicles the what-if adventures of a young boy who is struck in the head by a meteor and gains superhuman powers, eventually saving his town from a nuclear disaster. Watsuki felt disgusted with the work and originally did not plan on revealing it, but ultimately decided to include ''Meteor Strike'' in the final ''Rurouni Kenshin'' volume to increase its page count. Although, he said that after reading the story over again it \"relaxed\" him \"in a nice way.\"<ref name=\"MeteroStrik\">Watsuki, Nobuhiro. ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]] Volume 28''. Viz Media. 155.</ref> Watsuki included three main elements in the story, which he described as having \"some different flavors\" than ''Rurouni Kenshin''. He had wanted to use meteors in a story for a long time, since they are the \"most energetic natural phenomena.\" His second element was a boy wearing a pair of white gloves. Watsuki described white gloves as \"sort of plain\" and \"not cool at all,\" yet he considers the element to be one of his favorites since the gloves \"give off a sense of strength.\" His third element is the girl wearing a construction site helmet. The helmet is masculine, while the [[Japanese school uniform]] that the girl wears is feminine.<ref name=\"MeteroStrik\"/> Watsuki said that he created the main character Shinya \"on the spot,\" giving him too much honesty, and a personality that overlaps with that of Himura Kenshin, which he regrets \"a little.\" Watsuki created Chiho, the other major character, to show the \"[[Sh\u014djo manga|shojo]] theme of the moment\" when the boy out-matures the girl. Watsuki felt that the plan \"didn't work out so well\" and \"a lot wasn't what I wanted it to be.\" He added that he liked portraying the \"helpful nature\" of Chiho.<ref name=\"MeteroStrik\"/>\n\nIn 2001, Watsuki created his second serialized work, the western ''[[Gun Blaze West]]''. The story follows Viu Bannes, a young gunfighter on his journey towards Gun Blaze West, the place where the greatest gunmen go to test their strength. It ran in ''Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump'' for less-than a year, from January 8 to August 13, 2001.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mediaarts-db.bunka.go.jp/mg/magazines/321715 |title=\u9031\u520a\u5c11\u5e74\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\u30002001/01/08\u3000\u8868\u793a\u53f7\u65702 |website=Media Arts Database |publisher=Agency for Cultural Affairs |language=Japanese |accessdate=2017-04-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://mediaarts-db.bunka.go.jp/mg/magazines/321685 |title=\u9031\u520a\u5c11\u5e74\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\u30002001/08/13\u3000\u8868\u793a\u53f7\u657035 |website=Media Arts Database |publisher=Agency for Cultural Affairs |language=Japanese |accessdate=2017-04-16}}</ref> Its three volumes were published in English by Viz.\n\nHis third serialization ''[[Buso Renkin]]'', was published in ''Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump'' between July 7, 2003 and May 9, 2005,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mediaarts-db.bunka.go.jp/mg/magazines/321591 |title=\u9031\u520a\u5c11\u5e74\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\u30002003/07/07\u3000\u8868\u793a\u53f7\u657030 |website=Media Arts Database |publisher=Agency for Cultural Affairs |language=Japanese |accessdate=2017-04-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://mediaarts-db.bunka.go.jp/mg/magazines/321499 |title=\u9031\u520a\u5c11\u5e74\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\u30002005/05/09\u30fb5/16\u5408\u4f75\u3000\u8868\u793a\u53f7\u657021\u30fb22 |website=Media Arts Database |publisher=Agency for Cultural Affairs |language=Japanese |accessdate=2017-04-16}}</ref> with two special chapters published in ''[[Akamaru Jump]]''.

He is the eldest in their family. \n\nAfter his High School graduation, Fumiya started living alone in [[Tokyo]] while pursuing his vocational degree in Hotel Management.\n\nHe joined the hospitality workforce after his graduation from vocational school and worked in a hotel in [[Shinjuku]] as a bell boy. He resigned from his hotel job after two years and decided to pursue his dream of establishing his own clothing line. \n\nHe thought that being famous would make his clothes sell faster and one way would be to become famous as a vlogger. He then started making YouTube videos.\n\n=== 2017 \u2013 Present: Life in the Philippines ===\nHaving observed their hotel guests, he realized that being able to speak English is important for his business plans.

Storytelling was used to explain natural phenomena, bards told stories of creation and developed a pantheon of gods and myths. Oral stories passed from one generation to the next and storytellers were regarded as healers, leaders, spiritual guides, teachers, cultural secrets keepers and entertainers. Oral storytelling came in various forms including songs, poetry, chants and dance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://study.com/academy/lesson/oral-tradition-of-storytelling-definition-history-examples.html|title=Oral Tradition of Storytelling: Definition, History & Examples \u2013 Video & Lesson Transcript {{!}} Study.com|website=study.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-08|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629085149/http://study.com/academy/lesson/oral-tradition-of-storytelling-definition-history-examples.html|archivedate=2017-06-29}}</ref>\n\n[[Albert Lord|Albert Bates Lord]] examined oral narratives from field transcripts of Yugoslav oral bards collected by [[Milman Parry]] in the 1930s, and the texts of epics such as the [[Odyssey]].<ref>Lord, Albert Bates (2000). The singer of tales, Cambridge: Harvard University Press.</ref> Lord found that a large part of the stories consisted of text which was improvised during the telling process.\n\nLord identified two types of ''story vocabulary.'' The first he called \"formulas\": \"[[Rosy-fingered Dawn|rosy-fingered dawn]]\", \"[[Wine-Dark Sea|the wine-dark sea]]\" and other specific [[set phrase]]s had long been known of in [[Homer]] and other oral epics. Lord, however, discovered that across many story traditions, fully 90% of an oral epic is assembled from lines which are repeated verbatim or which use one-for-one word substitutions. In other words, oral stories are built out of set phrases which have been stockpiled from a lifetime of hearing and telling stories.\n\nThe other type of story vocabulary is theme, a set sequence of story actions that structure a tale. Just as the teller of tales proceeds line-by-line using formulas, so he proceeds from event-to-event using themes. One near-universal theme is repetition, as evidenced in Western [[folklore]] with the \"[[Rule of three (writing)|rule of three]]\": Three brothers set out, three attempts are made, three riddles are asked. A theme can be as simple as a specific set sequence describing the arming of a [[hero]], starting with shirt and trousers and ending with headdress and weapons. A theme can be large enough to be a plot component. For example: a hero proposes a journey to a dangerous place / he disguises himself / his disguise fools everybody / except for a common person of little account (a [[crone]], a tavern maid or a woodcutter) / who immediately recognizes him / the commoner becomes the hero's ally, showing unexpected resources of skill or initiative. A theme does not belong to a specific story, but may be found with minor variation in many different stories.\n\nThe story was described by [[Reynolds Price]], when he wrote: <blockquote>\nA need to tell and hear stories is essential to the species Homo sapiens&nbsp;\u2013 second in necessity apparently after nourishment and before love and shelter. Millions survive without love or home, almost none in silence; the opposite of silence leads quickly to narrative, and the sound of story is the dominant sound of our lives, from the small accounts of our day's events to the vast incommunicable constructs of psychopaths.<ref>Price, Reynolds (1978). A Palpable God, New York:Atheneum, p.3.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n===M\u00e4rchen and Sagen===\n[[File:Schlesisches M\u00e4rchen.png|thumb|Illustration from ''Silesian Folk Tales'' (The Book of [[Rubezahl]])]]\n\nFolklorists sometimes divide oral tales into two main groups: ''M\u00e4rchen'' and ''Sagen''.<ref>Storytellingday.net. \"[http://www.storytellingday.net/oral-traditions-storytelling-explored.html Oral Traditions In Storytelling ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208125620/http://storytellingday.net/oral-traditions-storytelling-explored.html |date=2013-12-08 }}.\" Retrieved November 21, 2013.</ref> These are [[German language|German]] terms for which there are no exact [[English language|English]] equivalents, however we have approximations:\n\n''M\u00e4rchen'', loosely translated as \"[[fairy tale|fairy tale(s)]]\" (lit. little stories), take place in a kind of separate \"once-upon-a-time\" world of nowhere-in-particular, at an indeterminate time in the past. They are clearly not intended to be understood as true. The stories are full of clearly defined incidents, and peopled by rather flat characters with little or no interior life. When the supernatural occurs, it is presented matter-of-factly, without surprise. Indeed, there is very little effect, generally; bloodcurdling events may take place, but with little call for emotional response from the listener.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\n''Sagen'', best translated as \"[[legend]]s\", are supposed to have actually happened, very often at a particular time and place, and they draw much of their power from this fact. When the supernatural intrudes (as it often does), it does so in an emotionally fraught manner. Ghost and [[Lovers' Leap|lovers' leap]] stories belong in this category, as do many UFO stories and stories of supernatural beings and events.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\nAnother important examination of orality in human life is [[Walter J. Ong]]'s ''Orality and Literacy: The Technologizing of the Word'' (1982). Ong studies the distinguishing characteristics of oral traditions, how oral and written cultures interact and condition one another, and how they ultimately influence human epistemology.\n\n==Storytelling and learning==\n[[File:Orunamamu.jpg|thumb|left|[[Orunamamu]] storyteller, griot with cane]]Storytelling is a means for sharing and interpreting experiences.

Together a storyteller and listener can seek best practices and invent new solutions.

This is because everyone in the community can add their own touch and perspective to the narrative collaboratively \u2013 both individual and culturally shared perspectives have a place in the co-creation of the story. [[Oral storytelling]] in indigenous communities differs from other forms of stories because they are told not only for entertainment, but for teaching values.<ref name=\"Archibald 2008\">Archibald, Jo-Ann, (2008). Indigenous Storywork: Educating The Heart, Mind, Body and Spirit. Vancouver, British Columbia: The University of British Columbia Press.</ref> For example, the [[Sto:lo]] community in Canada focuses on reinforcing children's identity by telling stories about the land to explain their roles.<ref name=\"Archibald 2008\"/>\n\nFurthermore, Storytelling is a way to teach younger members of indigenous communities about their culture and their identities. In Donna Eder's study, [[Navajos]] were interviewed about storytelling practices that they have had in the past and what changes they want to see in the future. They notice that storytelling makes an impact on the lives of the children of the Navajos. According to some of the Navajos that were interviewed, storytelling is one of many main practices that teaches children the important principles to live a good life.<ref name=\":0\" /> In indigenous communities, stories are a way to pass knowledge on from generation to generation.\n\nFor some indigenous people, experience has no separation between the physical world and the spiritual world. Thus, some indigenous people communicate to their children through ritual, storytelling, or dialogue. Community values, learned through storytelling, help to guide future generations and aid in identity formation.<ref>Vannini, Phillip, and J. Patrick Williams. Authenticity in Culture, Self and Society. Farnham, England: Ashgate Pub., 2009.</ref>\n\nIn the [[Quechua people|Quechua community]] of Highland Peru, there is no separation between adults and children. This allows for children to learn storytelling through their own interpretations of the given story. Therefore, children in the [[Quechua people|Quechua community]] are encouraged to listen to the story that is being told in order to learn about their identity and culture. Sometimes, children are expected to sit quietly and listen actively. This enables them to engage in activities as independent learners.<ref>Bolin, Inge. (2006). Growing Up in a Culture of Respect: Child Rearing in Highland Peru.

In [[Navajo]] communities, for children and adults, storytelling is one of the many effective ways to educate both the young and old about their cultures, identities and history. Storytelling help the Navajos know who they are, where they come from and where they belong.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|jstor = 25166626|title = Bringing Navajos Storytelling Practices into Schools.

Utilizing Traditional Storytelling to Promote Wellness in American Indian Communities.</ref> During the telling of the story, [[Child Integration|children]] may act as participants by asking questions, acting out the story, or telling smaller parts of the story.<ref>Hodge, F.S., Pasqua, A., Marquez, C.A., & Geishirt-Cantrell, B. (2002). Utilizing traditional storytelling to promote wellness in American Indian communities.</ref> Furthermore, stories are not often told in the same manner twice, resulting in many variations of a single myth. This is because narrators may choose to insert new elements into old stories dependent upon the relationship between the storyteller and the audience, making the story correspond to each unique situation.<ref name=\"Silko, L. Storyteller 1981\">Silko, L. Storyteller. New York, New York: Seaver Books Pub., 1981.</ref>\n\nIndigenous cultures also use [[teasing#Teasing in Indigenous American Communities|instructional ribbing]]\u2014 a playful form of correcting children's undesirable behavior\u2014 in their stories. For example, the [[Ojibwe]] (or Chippewa) tribe uses the tale of an owl snatching away misbehaving children. The caregiver will often say, \"The owl will come and stick you in his ears if you don't stop crying!\" Thus, this form of teasing serves as a tool to correct inappropriate behavior and promote cooperation.<ref>Hilger, 1951. Chippewa Childlife and its Cultural Background.</ref>\n\n====Types of storytelling in indigenous peoples====\nThere are various types of stories among many indigenous communities. Communication in Indigenous American communities is rich with stories, myths, philosophies and narratives that serve as a means to exchange information.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Learning From the Grandmothers: Incorporating Indigenous Principles Into Qualitative Research|last = Loppie|first = Charlotte|date = February 2007|journal = Qualitative Health Research|volume = 17|issue = 2|pages = 276\u201384|doi = 10.1177/1049732306297905|pmid = 17220397}}</ref> These stories may be used for coming of age themes, core values, morality, literacy and history. Very often, the stories are used to instruct and teach children about [[Moral development|cultural values and lessons]].<ref name=\"Silko, L. Storyteller 1981\"/> The meaning within the stories is not always explicit, and children are expected to make their own meaning of the stories. In the [[Lakota People|Lakota Tribe]] of North America, for example, young girls are often told the story of the [[White Buffalo Calf Woman]], who is a spiritual figure that protects young girls from the whims of men. In the [[Odawa|Odawa Tribe]], young boys are often told the story of a young man who never took care of his body, and as a result, his feet fail to run when he tries to escape predators. This story serves as an indirect means of encouraging the young boys to take care of their bodies.<ref>Pelletier, W. Childhood in an Indian Village. 1970.</ref>\n\nNarratives can be shared to express the values or morals among family, relatives, or people who are considered part of the close-knit community. Many stories in indigenous American communities all have a \"surface\" story, that entails knowing certain information and clues to unlocking the metaphors in the story. The underlying message of the story being told, can be understood and interpreted with clues that hint to a certain interpretation.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title = Indigenous Storywork: Educating the Heart, Mind, and Spirit|last = Archibald|first = Jo-Ann|publisher = University of British Columbia Press|year = 2008|isbn = 9780774814010|location = Canada|pages = 76}}</ref> In order to make meaning from these stories, elders in the [[Sto:lo|Sto:Lo]] community for example, emphasize the importance in learning how to listen, since it requires the senses to bring one's heart and mind together.<ref name=\":1\" /> For instance, a way in which children learn about the metaphors significant for the society they live in, is by listening to their elders and participating in rituals where they respect one another.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Growing Up in a Culture of Respect: Child Rearing in Highland Peru|last = Bolin|first = Inge|publisher = University of Texas Press|year = 2006|isbn = 978-0292712980|location = Austin|pages = 136}}</ref>\n\nSome people also make a case for different narrative forms being classified as storytelling in the contemporary world. For example, digital storytelling, online and dice-and-paper-based role-playing games. In traditional [[role-playing games]], storytelling is done by the person who controls the environment and the non playing fictional characters, and moves the story elements along for the players as they interact with the storyteller. The game is advanced by mainly verbal interactions, with dice roll determining random events in the fictional universe, where the players interact with each other and the storyteller. This type of game has many genres, such as [[sci-fi]] and fantasy, as well as alternate-reality worlds based on the current reality, but with different setting and beings such as werewolves, aliens, daemons, or hidden societies. These oral-based role-playing games were very popular in the 1990s among circles of youth in many countries before computer and console-based online MMORPG's took their place. Despite the prevalence of computer-based MMORPGs, the dice-and-paper RPG still has a dedicated following.\n\n====Passing on of Values in indigenous cultures====\nStories in indigenous cultures encompass a variety of [[Moral development|values]]. These values include an emphasis on individual responsibility, concern for the environment and communal welfare.<ref>Hodge, et al. 2002. Utilizing Traditional Storytelling to Promote Wellness in American Indian Communities.</ref>\n\nStories are based on values passed down by older generations to shape the foundation of the community.<ref>Jeff Corntassel, Chaw-win-is, and T'lakwadzi. \"Indigenous Storytelling, Truth-telling and Community Approaches to Reconciliation.\" ESC: English Studies in Canada 35.1 (2009): 137\u201359)</ref> Storytelling is used as a bridge for knowledge and understanding allowing the values of \"self\" and \"community\" to connect and be learned as a whole. Storytelling in the [[Navajo]] community for example allows for community values to be learned at different times and places for different learners. Stories are told from the perspective of other people, animals, or the natural elements of the earth.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Life Lessons through Storytelling: Children's Exploration of Ethics|last = Eder|first = Donna|publisher = Indiana University Press|year = 2010|isbn = 978-0253222442|location = |pages = 7\u201323}}</ref> In this way, children learn to value their place in the world as a person in relation to others. Typically, stories are used as an [[informal learning]] tool in Indigenous American communities, and can act as an alternative method for reprimanding children's bad behavior. In this way, stories are non-confrontational, which allows the child to discover for themselves what they did wrong and what they can do to adjust the behavior.<ref>Battiste, Marie. Indigenous Knowledge and Pedagogy in First Nations Education: A Literature Review with Recommendations. Ottawa, Ont.: Indian and Northern Affairs, 2002.</ref>\n\nParents in the [[Arizona Tewa]] community, for example, teach morals to their children through traditional narratives.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kroskrity|first=P. V.|title=Narrative reproductions: Ideologies of storytelling, authoritative words and generic regimentation in the village of Tewa.|journal=Journal of Linguistic Anthropology|date=2009|volume=19|pages=40\u201356|doi=10.1111/j.1548-1395.2009.01018.x}}</ref> Lessons focus on several topics including historical or \"sacred\" stories or more domestic disputes. Through storytelling, the Tewa community emphasizes the traditional wisdom of the ancestors and the importance of collective as well as individual identities. Indigenous communities teach children valuable skills and morals through the actions of good or mischievous stock characters while also allowing room for children to make meaning for themselves. By not being given every element of the story, children rely on their own experiences and not formal teaching from adults to fill in the gaps.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pelletier|first=Wilfred|title=Childhood in an Indian Village|journal=Two Articles|date=1969}}</ref>\n\nWhen children listen to stories, they periodically vocalize their ongoing [[attention]] and accept the extended turn of the storyteller. The emphasis on attentiveness to surrounding events and the importance of oral tradition in indigenous communities teaches children the skill of keen attention. For example, Children of the [[Tohono O'odham]] American Indian community who engaged in more cultural practices were able to recall the events in a verbally presented story better than those who did not engage in cultural practices.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Tsethlikai|first=M.|author2=Rogoff |title=Involvement in traditional cultural practices and American Indian children's incidental recall of a folktale.|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=2013|volume=49|issue=3|pages=568\u2013578|doi=10.1037/a0031308|pmid=23316771}}</ref> Body movements and gestures help to communicate values and keep stories alive for future generations.<ref>Fisher, Mary Pat.

Indigenous Literacies in the Americas: Language Planning from the Bottom up. Berlin: Mouton De Gruyter, 1997</ref>\n\nChildren in indigenous communities can also learn from the underlying message of a story. For example, in a [[Nahua peoples|nahuatl]] community near [[Mexico City]], stories about ahuaques or hostile water dwelling spirits that guard over the bodies of water, contain morals about respecting the environment. If the protagonist of a story, who has accidentally broken something that belongs to the ahuaque, does not replace it or give back in some way to the ahuaque, the [[protagonist]] dies.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://www.redalyc.org/articulo.oa?id=55703708|title = Infancia nahua y transmisi\u00f3n de la cosmovisi\u00f3n: los ahuaques o esp\u00edritus pluviales en la Sierra de Texcoco (M\u00e9xico)|last = Lorente Fern\u00e1ndez|first = David|date = 2006|journal = Bolet\u00edn de Antropolog\u00eda Universidad de Antioquia|volume = {{articulo.volRevNum}}|issue = {{articulo.numRevNum}}|pages = &#123;&#123;paginasArticulo&#91;0&#93;&#125;&#125;\u2013&#123;&#123;paginasArticulo&#91;1&#93;&#125;&#125;|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151208163320/http://www.redalyc.org/articulo.oa?id=55703708|archivedate = 2015-12-08}}</ref> In this way, storytelling serves as a way to teach what the community values, such as valuing the environment.\n\nStorytelling also serves to deliver a particular message during spiritual and ceremonial functions. In the ceremonial use of storytelling, the unity building theme of the message becomes more important than the time, place and characters of the message. Once the message is delivered, the story is finished. As cycles of the tale are told and retold, story units can recombine, showing various outcomes for a person's actions.<ref>VanDeusen, Kira.

Iseke's study (2013)<ref>{{Cite journal|jstor = 10.1525/irqr.2013.6.4.559|title = Indigenous Storytelling As Research|last = Iseke|first = Judy|date = 2013|journal = International Review of Qualitative Research|doi = 10.1525/irqr.2013.6.4.559|pmid =|volume=6|issue = 4|pages=559\u2013577}}</ref> on the role of storytelling in the [[M\u00e9tis people (United States)|Metis]] community, showed promise in furthering research about the Metis and their shared communal atmosphere during storytelling events.  Iseke focused on the idea of witnessing a storyteller as a vital way to share and partake in the Metis community, as members of the community would stop everything else they were doing in order to listen or \"witness\" the storyteller and allow the story to become a \"ceremonial landscape,\" or shared reference, for everyone present.  This was a powerful tool for the community to engage and teach new learner shared references for the values and ideologies of the Metis.  Through storytelling, the Metis cemented the shared reference of personal or popular stories and [[folklore]], which members of the community can use to share ideologies.  In the future, Iseke noted that Metis elders wished for the stories being told to be used for further research into their culture, as stories were a traditional way to pass down vital knowledge to younger generations.\n\nFor the stories we read, the \"neuro-semantic encoding of narratives happens at levels higher than individual semantic units and that this encoding is systematic across both individuals and languages.\" This encoding seems to appear most prominently in the default mode network.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dehghani|first=Morteza|last2=Boghrati|first2=Reihane|last3=Man|first3=Kingson|last4=Hoover|first4=Joe|last5=Gimbel|first5=Sarah I.|last6=Vaswani|first6=Ashish|last7=Zevin|first7=Jason D.|last8=Immordino-Yang|first8=Mary Helen|last9=Gordon|first9=Andrew S.|date=2017-12-01|title=Decoding the neural representation of story meanings across languages|journal=Human Brain Mapping|language=en|volume=38|issue=12|pages=6096\u20136106|doi=10.1002/hbm.23814|pmid=28940969|issn=1097-0193|url=http://psyarxiv.com/qrpp3/|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n==Serious Storytelling==\nStorytelling in serious application contexts, as e.g. therapeutics, business, serious games, medicine, education, or faith can be referred to as serious storytelling.

Oftentimes, these stories affect the audience in a therapeutic sense as well, helping them to view situations similar to their own through a different lens.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Women Escaping Violence: Empowerment through Narrative|last = Lawless|first = Elaine|publisher = University of Missouri Press|year = 2001|isbn = 978-0-8262-1314-3|location = Columbia and London|pages = 7}}</ref>   Noted author and folklore scholar, Elaine Lawless states, \"\u2026this process provides new avenues for understanding and identity formation.

In this way, that telling and retelling of the narrative serves to \"reattach portions of the narrative\".<ref>{{Cite book|title = Women Escaping Violence: Empowerment through Narrative|last = Lawless|first = Elaine|publisher = University of Missouri Press|year = 2001|isbn = |location = |pages = 90}}</ref>  These gaps may occur due to a repression of the trauma or even just a want to keep the most gruesome details private.  Regardless, these silences are not as empty as they appear, and it is only this act of storytelling that can enable the teller to fill them back in.\n\nPsychodrama uses re-enactment of a personal, traumatic event in the life of a psychodrama group participant as a therapeutic methodology, first developed by psychiatrist, [[J.L. Moreno]], M.D.  This therapeutic use of storytelling was incorporated into [[Drama Therapy]], known in the field as \"Self Revalatory Theater.\" in 1975] Jonathan Fox and Jo Salas developed a therapeutic, improvisational storytelling form they called [[Playback Theatre]]. Therapeutic storytelling is also used to promote healing through [[transformative arts]], where a facilitator helps a participant write and often present their personal story to an audience.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Harter | first1 = L.M. | last2 = Bochner | first2 = A.P. | year = 2009 | title = Healing through stories: A special issue on narrative medicine | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Communication Research | volume = 37 | issue = 2| pages = 113\u2013117 | doi = 10.1080/00909880902792271 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\n==Storytelling as art form==\n\nAesthetics\nThe art of narrative is, by definition, an [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] enterprise, and there are a number of artistic elements that typically interact in well-developed stories. Such elements include the essential idea of narrative structure with identifiable beginnings, middles, and endings, or exposition-development-climax-resolution-denouement, normally constructed into coherent plot lines; a strong focus on temporality, which includes retention of the past, attention to present action and protention/future anticipation; a substantial focus on characters and characterization which is \"arguably the most important single component of the novel\";<ref>[[David Lodge (author)|David Lodge]] ''[[The Art of Fiction (book)|The Art of Fiction]]'' 67</ref> a given [[Isogloss|heterogloss]] of different voices dialogically at play&nbsp;\u2013 \"the sound of the human voice, or many voices, speaking in a variety of accents, rhythms and registers\";<ref>Lodge ''The Art of Fiction'' 97</ref> possesses a narrator or narrator-like voice, which by definition \"addresses\" and \"interacts with\" reading audiences (see [[Reader Response]] theory); communicates with a [[Wayne Booth]]-esque rhetorical thrust, a dialectic process of interpretation, which is at times beneath the surface, conditioning a plotted narrative, and at other times much more visible, \"arguing\" for and against various positions; relies substantially on now-standard aesthetic figuration, particularly including the use of [[metaphor]], metonymy, [[synecdoche]] and [[irony]] (see [[Hayden White]], ''[[Metahistory: The Historical Imagination in Nineteenth-century Europe|Metahistory]]'' for expansion of this idea); is often enmeshed in intertextuality, with copious connections, references, allusions, similarities, parallels, etc. to other literatures; and commonly demonstrates an effort toward ''[[bildungsroman]]'', a description of identity development with an effort to evince ''becoming'' in character and community.\n\nFestivals\n[[Storytelling festival]]s typically feature the work of several storytellers and may include workshops for tellers and others who are interested in the art form or other targeted applications of storytelling. Elements of the [[oral storytelling]] art form often include the tellers encouragement to have participants co-create an experience by connecting to relatable elements of the story and using techniques of  [[Mental image|visualization]] (the seeing of images in the mind's eye), and use vocal and bodily [[gestures]] to support understanding. In many ways, the art of storytelling draws upon other art forms such as [[acting]], [[oral interpretation]] and [[Performance Studies|performance studies]].\n\nIn 1903, Richard Wyche, a professor of literature at the University of Tennessee created the first organized storytellers league of its kind.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}  It was called The National Story League. Wyche served as its president for 16 years, facilitated storytelling classes, and spurred an interest in the art.\n\nSeveral other storytelling organizations started in the U.S. during the 1970s. One such organization was the National Association for the Perpetuation and Preservation of Storytelling (NAPPS), now the National Storytelling Network (NSN) and the International Storytelling Center (ISC). NSN is a professional organization that helps to organize resources for tellers and festival planners. The ISC runs the [[National Storytelling Festival]] in [[Jonesborough, TN]].<ref>Wolf, Eric James.

The material of any given story naturally undergoes several changes and [[wikt:adjustment|adaptation]]s during this process. When and where [[oral tradition]] was pushed back in favor of [[print media]], the [[literature|literary]] [[idea]] of the [[author]] as originator of a story's [[authority|authoritative]] version changed people's [[perception]] of stories themselves. In centuries following, stories tended to be seen as the work of individuals rather than a collective effort. Only recently when a significant number of influential authors began questioning their own roles, the value of stories as such&nbsp;\u2013 independent of authorship&nbsp;\u2013 was again recognized. Literary critics such as [[Roland Barthes]] even proclaimed the [[Death of the Author]].\n\n==In business==\nPeople have been telling stories at work since ancient times, when stories might inspire \u201ccourage and empowerment during the hunt for a potentially dangerous animal,\u201d or simply instill the value of listening.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lawrence|first=Randee Lipson|last2=Paige|first2=Dennis Swiftdeer|date=March 2016|title=What Our Ancestors Knew: Teaching and Learning Through Storytelling|journal=New Directions for Adult and Continuing Education|volume=2016|issue=149|pages=63\u201372|doi=10.1002/ace.20177|issn=1052-2891}}</ref> Storytelling in business has become a field in its own right as industries have grown, as storytelling becomes a more popular art form in general through live storytelling events like [[The Moth]].\n\n====== Recruiting ======\nStorytelling has come to have a prominent role in recruiting.

In addition to its traditional forms ([[fairytales]], [[Folklore|folktales]], [[mythology]], [[legend]]s, [[fables]] etc.), it has extended itself to representing history, personal narrative, political commentary and evolving cultural norms.

Storytelling was used to explain natural phenomena, bards told stories of creation and developed a pantheon of gods and myths. Oral stories passed from one generation to the next and storytellers were regarded as healers, leaders, spiritual guides, teachers, cultural secrets keepers and entertainers. Oral storytelling came in various forms including songs, poetry, chants and dance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://study.com/academy/lesson/oral-tradition-of-storytelling-definition-history-examples.html|title=Oral Tradition of Storytelling: Definition, History & Examples \u2013 Video & Lesson Transcript {{!}} Study.com|website=study.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-08|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629085149/http://study.com/academy/lesson/oral-tradition-of-storytelling-definition-history-examples.html|archivedate=2017-06-29}}</ref>\n\n[[Albert Lord|Albert Bates Lord]] examined oral narratives from field transcripts of Yugoslav oral bards collected by [[Milman Parry]] in the 1930s, and the texts of epics such as the [[Odyssey]].<ref>Lord, Albert Bates (2000). The singer of tales, Cambridge: Harvard University Press.</ref> Lord found that a large part of the stories consisted of text which was improvised during the telling process.\n\nLord identified two types of ''story vocabulary.'' The first he called \"formulas\": \"[[Rosy-fingered Dawn|rosy-fingered dawn]]\", \"[[Wine-Dark Sea|the wine-dark sea]]\" and other specific [[set phrase]]s had long been known of in [[Homer]] and other oral epics. Lord, however, discovered that across many story traditions, fully 90% of an oral epic is assembled from lines which are repeated verbatim or which use one-for-one word substitutions. In other words, oral stories are built out of set phrases which have been stockpiled from a lifetime of hearing and telling stories.\n\nThe other type of story vocabulary is theme, a set sequence of story actions that structure a tale. Just as the teller of tales proceeds line-by-line using formulas, so he proceeds from event-to-event using themes. One near-universal theme is repetition, as evidenced in Western [[folklore]] with the \"[[Rule of three (writing)|rule of three]]\": Three brothers set out, three attempts are made, three riddles are asked. A theme can be as simple as a specific set sequence describing the arming of a [[hero]], starting with shirt and trousers and ending with headdress and weapons. A theme can be large enough to be a plot component. For example: a hero proposes a journey to a dangerous place / he disguises himself / his disguise fools everybody / except for a common person of little account (a [[crone]], a tavern maid or a woodcutter) / who immediately recognizes him / the commoner becomes the hero's ally, showing unexpected resources of skill or initiative. A theme does not belong to a specific story, but may be found with minor variation in many different stories.\n\nThe story was described by [[Reynolds Price]], when he wrote: <blockquote>\nA need to tell and hear stories is essential to the species Homo sapiens&nbsp;\u2013 second in necessity apparently after nourishment and before love and shelter. Millions survive without love or home, almost none in silence; the opposite of silence leads quickly to narrative, and the sound of story is the dominant sound of our lives, from the small accounts of our day's events to the vast incommunicable constructs of psychopaths.<ref>Price, Reynolds (1978). A Palpable God, New York:Atheneum, p.3.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n===M\u00e4rchen and Sagen===\n[[File:Schlesisches M\u00e4rchen.png|thumb|Illustration from ''Silesian Folk Tales'' (The Book of [[Rubezahl]])]]\n\nFolklorists sometimes divide oral tales into two main groups: ''M\u00e4rchen'' and ''Sagen''.<ref>Storytellingday.net. \"[http://www.storytellingday.net/oral-traditions-storytelling-explored.html Oral Traditions In Storytelling ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208125620/http://storytellingday.net/oral-traditions-storytelling-explored.html |date=2013-12-08 }}.\" Retrieved November 21, 2013.</ref> These are [[German language|German]] terms for which there are no exact [[English language|English]] equivalents, however we have approximations:\n\n''M\u00e4rchen'', loosely translated as \"[[fairy tale|fairy tale(s)]]\" (lit. little stories), take place in a kind of separate \"once-upon-a-time\" world of nowhere-in-particular, at an indeterminate time in the past. They are clearly not intended to be understood as true. The stories are full of clearly defined incidents, and peopled by rather flat characters with little or no interior life. When the supernatural occurs, it is presented matter-of-factly, without surprise. Indeed, there is very little effect, generally; bloodcurdling events may take place, but with little call for emotional response from the listener.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\n''Sagen'', best translated as \"[[legend]]s\", are supposed to have actually happened, very often at a particular time and place, and they draw much of their power from this fact. When the supernatural intrudes (as it often does), it does so in an emotionally fraught manner. Ghost and [[Lovers' Leap|lovers' leap]] stories belong in this category, as do many UFO stories and stories of supernatural beings and events.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\nAnother important examination of orality in human life is [[Walter J. Ong]]'s ''Orality and Literacy: The Technologizing of the Word'' (1982). Ong studies the distinguishing characteristics of oral traditions, how oral and written cultures interact and condition one another, and how they ultimately influence human epistemology.\n\n==Storytelling and learning==\n[[File:Orunamamu.jpg|thumb|left|[[Orunamamu]] storyteller, griot with cane]]Storytelling is a means for sharing and interpreting experiences.

Often a person needs to attempt to tell the story of that experience before realizing its value. In this case, it is not only the listener who learns, but the teller who also becomes aware of his or her own unique experiences and background.<ref>{{cite web|last=Doty|first=Elizabeth|title=Transforming Capabilities: Using Story for Knowledge Discovery & Community Development|url=http://www.worklore.com/WorkLore_TransformingCapabilities_EDoty.pdf|publisher=Storytelling In Organizations|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130813195910/http://www.worklore.com/WorkLore_TransformingCapabilities_EDoty.pdf|archivedate=2013-08-13}}</ref> This process of storytelling is empowering as the teller effectively conveys ideas and, with practice, is able to demonstrate the potential of human accomplishment. Storytelling taps into existing knowledge and creates bridges both culturally and motivationally toward a solution.\n\nStories are effective educational tools because listeners become engaged and therefore remember.

Together a storyteller and listener can seek best practices and invent new solutions. Because stories often have multiple layers of meanings, listeners have to listen closely to identify the underlying knowledge in the story. Storytelling is used as a tool to teach children the importance of respect through the practice of listening.<ref>Archibald, Jo-Ann. (2008).

To teach this a [[Kinesthetic learning]]style would be used, involving the listeners through music, dream interpretation, or dance.<ref>Fisher-Yoshida, Beth, Kathy Dee. Geller and Steven A. Schapiro.

This is because everyone in the community can add their own touch and perspective to the narrative collaboratively \u2013 both individual and culturally shared perspectives have a place in the co-creation of the story. [[Oral storytelling]] in indigenous communities differs from other forms of stories because they are told not only for entertainment, but for teaching values.<ref name=\"Archibald 2008\">Archibald, Jo-Ann, (2008). Indigenous Storywork: Educating The Heart, Mind, Body and Spirit. Vancouver, British Columbia: The University of British Columbia Press.</ref> For example, the [[Sto:lo]] community in Canada focuses on reinforcing children's identity by telling stories about the land to explain their roles.<ref name=\"Archibald 2008\"/>\n\nFurthermore, Storytelling is a way to teach younger members of indigenous communities about their culture and their identities. In Donna Eder's study, [[Navajos]] were interviewed about storytelling practices that they have had in the past and what changes they want to see in the future. They notice that storytelling makes an impact on the lives of the children of the Navajos. According to some of the Navajos that were interviewed, storytelling is one of many main practices that teaches children the important principles to live a good life.<ref name=\":0\" /> In indigenous communities, stories are a way to pass knowledge on from generation to generation.\n\nFor some indigenous people, experience has no separation between the physical world and the spiritual world. Thus, some indigenous people communicate to their children through ritual, storytelling, or dialogue. Community values, learned through storytelling, help to guide future generations and aid in identity formation.<ref>Vannini, Phillip, and J. Patrick Williams. Authenticity in Culture, Self and Society. Farnham, England: Ashgate Pub., 2009.</ref>\n\nIn the [[Quechua people|Quechua community]] of Highland Peru, there is no separation between adults and children. This allows for children to learn storytelling through their own interpretations of the given story. Therefore, children in the [[Quechua people|Quechua community]] are encouraged to listen to the story that is being told in order to learn about their identity and culture. Sometimes, children are expected to sit quietly and listen actively. This enables them to engage in activities as independent learners.<ref>Bolin, Inge. (2006). Growing Up in a Culture of Respect: Child Rearing in Highland Peru. Austin, Texas: The University of Texas Press.</ref>\n\nThis teaching practice of storytelling allowed children to formulate ideas based on their own experiences and perspectives. In [[Navajo]] communities, for children and adults, storytelling is one of the many effective ways to educate both the young and old about their cultures, identities and history. Storytelling help the Navajos know who they are, where they come from and where they belong.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|jstor = 25166626|title = Bringing Navajos Storytelling Practices into Schools.

Utilizing Traditional Storytelling to Promote Wellness in American Indian Communities.</ref> During the telling of the story, [[Child Integration|children]] may act as participants by asking questions, acting out the story, or telling smaller parts of the story.<ref>Hodge, F.S., Pasqua, A., Marquez, C.A., & Geishirt-Cantrell, B. (2002). Utilizing traditional storytelling to promote wellness in American Indian communities.</ref> Furthermore, stories are not often told in the same manner twice, resulting in many variations of a single myth. This is because narrators may choose to insert new elements into old stories dependent upon the relationship between the storyteller and the audience, making the story correspond to each unique situation.<ref name=\"Silko, L. Storyteller 1981\">Silko, L. Storyteller. New York, New York: Seaver Books Pub., 1981.</ref>\n\nIndigenous cultures also use [[teasing#Teasing in Indigenous American Communities|instructional ribbing]]\u2014 a playful form of correcting children's undesirable behavior\u2014 in their stories. For example, the [[Ojibwe]] (or Chippewa) tribe uses the tale of an owl snatching away misbehaving children. The caregiver will often say, \"The owl will come and stick you in his ears if you don't stop crying!\" Thus, this form of teasing serves as a tool to correct inappropriate behavior and promote cooperation.<ref>Hilger, 1951. Chippewa Childlife and its Cultural Background.</ref>\n\n====Types of storytelling in indigenous peoples====\nThere are various types of stories among many indigenous communities. Communication in Indigenous American communities is rich with stories, myths, philosophies and narratives that serve as a means to exchange information.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Learning From the Grandmothers: Incorporating Indigenous Principles Into Qualitative Research|last = Loppie|first = Charlotte|date = February 2007|journal = Qualitative Health Research|volume = 17|issue = 2|pages = 276\u201384|doi = 10.1177/1049732306297905|pmid = 17220397}}</ref> These stories may be used for coming of age themes, core values, morality, literacy and history. Very often, the stories are used to instruct and teach children about [[Moral development|cultural values and lessons]].<ref name=\"Silko, L. Storyteller 1981\"/> The meaning within the stories is not always explicit, and children are expected to make their own meaning of the stories. In the [[Lakota People|Lakota Tribe]] of North America, for example, young girls are often told the story of the [[White Buffalo Calf Woman]], who is a spiritual figure that protects young girls from the whims of men. In the [[Odawa|Odawa Tribe]], young boys are often told the story of a young man who never took care of his body, and as a result, his feet fail to run when he tries to escape predators. This story serves as an indirect means of encouraging the young boys to take care of their bodies.<ref>Pelletier, W. Childhood in an Indian Village. 1970.</ref>\n\nNarratives can be shared to express the values or morals among family, relatives, or people who are considered part of the close-knit community. Many stories in indigenous American communities all have a \"surface\" story, that entails knowing certain information and clues to unlocking the metaphors in the story. The underlying message of the story being told, can be understood and interpreted with clues that hint to a certain interpretation.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title = Indigenous Storywork: Educating the Heart, Mind, and Spirit|last = Archibald|first = Jo-Ann|publisher = University of British Columbia Press|year = 2008|isbn = 9780774814010|location = Canada|pages = 76}}</ref> In order to make meaning from these stories, elders in the [[Sto:lo|Sto:Lo]] community for example, emphasize the importance in learning how to listen, since it requires the senses to bring one's heart and mind together.<ref name=\":1\" /> For instance, a way in which children learn about the metaphors significant for the society they live in, is by listening to their elders and participating in rituals where they respect one another.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Growing Up in a Culture of Respect: Child Rearing in Highland Peru|last = Bolin|first = Inge|publisher = University of Texas Press|year = 2006|isbn = 978-0292712980|location = Austin|pages = 136}}</ref>\n\nSome people also make a case for different narrative forms being classified as storytelling in the contemporary world. For example, digital storytelling, online and dice-and-paper-based role-playing games. In traditional [[role-playing games]], storytelling is done by the person who controls the environment and the non playing fictional characters, and moves the story elements along for the players as they interact with the storyteller. The game is advanced by mainly verbal interactions, with dice roll determining random events in the fictional universe, where the players interact with each other and the storyteller. This type of game has many genres, such as [[sci-fi]] and fantasy, as well as alternate-reality worlds based on the current reality, but with different setting and beings such as werewolves, aliens, daemons, or hidden societies. These oral-based role-playing games were very popular in the 1990s among circles of youth in many countries before computer and console-based online MMORPG's took their place. Despite the prevalence of computer-based MMORPGs, the dice-and-paper RPG still has a dedicated following.\n\n====Passing on of Values in indigenous cultures====\nStories in indigenous cultures encompass a variety of [[Moral development|values]]. These values include an emphasis on individual responsibility, concern for the environment and communal welfare.<ref>Hodge, et al. 2002. Utilizing Traditional Storytelling to Promote Wellness in American Indian Communities.</ref>\n\nStories are based on values passed down by older generations to shape the foundation of the community.<ref>Jeff Corntassel, Chaw-win-is, and T'lakwadzi. \"Indigenous Storytelling, Truth-telling and Community Approaches to Reconciliation.\" ESC: English Studies in Canada 35.1 (2009): 137\u201359)</ref> Storytelling is used as a bridge for knowledge and understanding allowing the values of \"self\" and \"community\" to connect and be learned as a whole. Storytelling in the [[Navajo]] community for example allows for community values to be learned at different times and places for different learners. Stories are told from the perspective of other people, animals, or the natural elements of the earth.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Life Lessons through Storytelling: Children's Exploration of Ethics|last = Eder|first = Donna|publisher = Indiana University Press|year = 2010|isbn = 978-0253222442|location = |pages = 7\u201323}}</ref> In this way, children learn to value their place in the world as a person in relation to others. Typically, stories are used as an [[informal learning]] tool in Indigenous American communities, and can act as an alternative method for reprimanding children's bad behavior. In this way, stories are non-confrontational, which allows the child to discover for themselves what they did wrong and what they can do to adjust the behavior.<ref>Battiste, Marie. Indigenous Knowledge and Pedagogy in First Nations Education: A Literature Review with Recommendations. Ottawa, Ont.: Indian and Northern Affairs, 2002.</ref>\n\nParents in the [[Arizona Tewa]] community, for example, teach morals to their children through traditional narratives.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kroskrity|first=P. V.|title=Narrative reproductions: Ideologies of storytelling, authoritative words and generic regimentation in the village of Tewa.|journal=Journal of Linguistic Anthropology|date=2009|volume=19|pages=40\u201356|doi=10.1111/j.1548-1395.2009.01018.x}}</ref> Lessons focus on several topics including historical or \"sacred\" stories or more domestic disputes. Through storytelling, the Tewa community emphasizes the traditional wisdom of the ancestors and the importance of collective as well as individual identities. Indigenous communities teach children valuable skills and morals through the actions of good or mischievous stock characters while also allowing room for children to make meaning for themselves. By not being given every element of the story, children rely on their own experiences and not formal teaching from adults to fill in the gaps.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pelletier|first=Wilfred|title=Childhood in an Indian Village|journal=Two Articles|date=1969}}</ref>\n\nWhen children listen to stories, they periodically vocalize their ongoing [[attention]] and accept the extended turn of the storyteller. The emphasis on attentiveness to surrounding events and the importance of oral tradition in indigenous communities teaches children the skill of keen attention. For example, Children of the [[Tohono O'odham]] American Indian community who engaged in more cultural practices were able to recall the events in a verbally presented story better than those who did not engage in cultural practices.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Tsethlikai|first=M.|author2=Rogoff |title=Involvement in traditional cultural practices and American Indian children's incidental recall of a folktale.|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=2013|volume=49|issue=3|pages=568\u2013578|doi=10.1037/a0031308|pmid=23316771}}</ref> Body movements and gestures help to communicate values and keep stories alive for future generations.<ref>Fisher, Mary Pat.

Indigenous Literacies in the Americas: Language Planning from the Bottom up. Berlin: Mouton De Gruyter, 1997</ref>\n\nChildren in indigenous communities can also learn from the underlying message of a story. For example, in a [[Nahua peoples|nahuatl]] community near [[Mexico City]], stories about ahuaques or hostile water dwelling spirits that guard over the bodies of water, contain morals about respecting the environment. If the protagonist of a story, who has accidentally broken something that belongs to the ahuaque, does not replace it or give back in some way to the ahuaque, the [[protagonist]] dies.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://www.redalyc.org/articulo.oa?id=55703708|title = Infancia nahua y transmisi\u00f3n de la cosmovisi\u00f3n: los ahuaques o esp\u00edritus pluviales en la Sierra de Texcoco (M\u00e9xico)|last = Lorente Fern\u00e1ndez|first = David|date = 2006|journal = Bolet\u00edn de Antropolog\u00eda Universidad de Antioquia|volume = {{articulo.volRevNum}}|issue = {{articulo.numRevNum}}|pages = &#123;&#123;paginasArticulo&#91;0&#93;&#125;&#125;\u2013&#123;&#123;paginasArticulo&#91;1&#93;&#125;&#125;|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151208163320/http://www.redalyc.org/articulo.oa?id=55703708|archivedate = 2015-12-08}}</ref> In this way, storytelling serves as a way to teach what the community values, such as valuing the environment.\n\nStorytelling also serves to deliver a particular message during spiritual and ceremonial functions. In the ceremonial use of storytelling, the unity building theme of the message becomes more important than the time, place and characters of the message. Once the message is delivered, the story is finished. As cycles of the tale are told and retold, story units can recombine, showing various outcomes for a person's actions.<ref>VanDeusen, Kira.

Iseke focused on the idea of witnessing a storyteller as a vital way to share and partake in the Metis community, as members of the community would stop everything else they were doing in order to listen or \"witness\" the storyteller and allow the story to become a \"ceremonial landscape,\" or shared reference, for everyone present.  This was a powerful tool for the community to engage and teach new learner shared references for the values and ideologies of the Metis.  Through storytelling, the Metis cemented the shared reference of personal or popular stories and [[folklore]], which members of the community can use to share ideologies.  In the future, Iseke noted that Metis elders wished for the stories being told to be used for further research into their culture, as stories were a traditional way to pass down vital knowledge to younger generations.\n\nFor the stories we read, the \"neuro-semantic encoding of narratives happens at levels higher than individual semantic units and that this encoding is systematic across both individuals and languages.\" This encoding seems to appear most prominently in the default mode network.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dehghani|first=Morteza|last2=Boghrati|first2=Reihane|last3=Man|first3=Kingson|last4=Hoover|first4=Joe|last5=Gimbel|first5=Sarah I.|last6=Vaswani|first6=Ashish|last7=Zevin|first7=Jason D.|last8=Immordino-Yang|first8=Mary Helen|last9=Gordon|first9=Andrew S.|date=2017-12-01|title=Decoding the neural representation of story meanings across languages|journal=Human Brain Mapping|language=en|volume=38|issue=12|pages=6096\u20136106|doi=10.1002/hbm.23814|pmid=28940969|issn=1097-0193|url=http://psyarxiv.com/qrpp3/|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n==Serious Storytelling==\nStorytelling in serious application contexts, as e.g. therapeutics, business, serious games, medicine, education, or faith can be referred to as serious storytelling.

Such elements include the essential idea of narrative structure with identifiable beginnings, middles, and endings, or exposition-development-climax-resolution-denouement, normally constructed into coherent plot lines; a strong focus on temporality, which includes retention of the past, attention to present action and protention/future anticipation; a substantial focus on characters and characterization which is \"arguably the most important single component of the novel\";<ref>[[David Lodge (author)|David Lodge]] ''[[The Art of Fiction (book)|The Art of Fiction]]'' 67</ref> a given [[Isogloss|heterogloss]] of different voices dialogically at play&nbsp;\u2013 \"the sound of the human voice, or many voices, speaking in a variety of accents, rhythms and registers\";<ref>Lodge ''The Art of Fiction'' 97</ref> possesses a narrator or narrator-like voice, which by definition \"addresses\" and \"interacts with\" reading audiences (see [[Reader Response]] theory); communicates with a [[Wayne Booth]]-esque rhetorical thrust, a dialectic process of interpretation, which is at times beneath the surface, conditioning a plotted narrative, and at other times much more visible, \"arguing\" for and against various positions; relies substantially on now-standard aesthetic figuration, particularly including the use of [[metaphor]], metonymy, [[synecdoche]] and [[irony]] (see [[Hayden White]], ''[[Metahistory: The Historical Imagination in Nineteenth-century Europe|Metahistory]]'' for expansion of this idea); is often enmeshed in intertextuality, with copious connections, references, allusions, similarities, parallels, etc. to other literatures; and commonly demonstrates an effort toward ''[[bildungsroman]]'', a description of identity development with an effort to evince ''becoming'' in character and community.\n\nFestivals\n[[Storytelling festival]]s typically feature the work of several storytellers and may include workshops for tellers and others who are interested in the art form or other targeted applications of storytelling. Elements of the [[oral storytelling]] art form often include the tellers encouragement to have participants co-create an experience by connecting to relatable elements of the story and using techniques of  [[Mental image|visualization]] (the seeing of images in the mind's eye), and use vocal and bodily [[gestures]] to support understanding. In many ways, the art of storytelling draws upon other art forms such as [[acting]], [[oral interpretation]] and [[Performance Studies|performance studies]].\n\nIn 1903, Richard Wyche, a professor of literature at the University of Tennessee created the first organized storytellers league of its kind.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}  It was called The National Story League. Wyche served as its president for 16 years, facilitated storytelling classes, and spurred an interest in the art.\n\nSeveral other storytelling organizations started in the U.S. during the 1970s. One such organization was the National Association for the Perpetuation and Preservation of Storytelling (NAPPS), now the National Storytelling Network (NSN) and the International Storytelling Center (ISC). NSN is a professional organization that helps to organize resources for tellers and festival planners. The ISC runs the [[National Storytelling Festival]] in [[Jonesborough, TN]].<ref>Wolf, Eric James.

The material of any given story naturally undergoes several changes and [[wikt:adjustment|adaptation]]s during this process. When and where [[oral tradition]] was pushed back in favor of [[print media]], the [[literature|literary]] [[idea]] of the [[author]] as originator of a story's [[authority|authoritative]] version changed people's [[perception]] of stories themselves. In centuries following, stories tended to be seen as the work of individuals rather than a collective effort. Only recently when a significant number of influential authors began questioning their own roles, the value of stories as such&nbsp;\u2013 independent of authorship&nbsp;\u2013 was again recognized. Literary critics such as [[Roland Barthes]] even proclaimed the [[Death of the Author]].\n\n==In business==\nPeople have been telling stories at work since ancient times, when stories might inspire \u201ccourage and empowerment during the hunt for a potentially dangerous animal,\u201d or simply instill the value of listening.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lawrence|first=Randee Lipson|last2=Paige|first2=Dennis Swiftdeer|date=March 2016|title=What Our Ancestors Knew: Teaching and Learning Through Storytelling|journal=New Directions for Adult and Continuing Education|volume=2016|issue=149|pages=63\u201372|doi=10.1002/ace.20177|issn=1052-2891}}</ref> Storytelling in business has become a field in its own right as industries have grown, as storytelling becomes a more popular art form in general through live storytelling events like [[The Moth]].\n\n====== Recruiting ======\nStorytelling has come to have a prominent role in recruiting.

Prior to that, employers usually placed newspaper ads telling a story about the kind of person they wanted, including their character and, in many cases, their ethnicity.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/08/insider/1854-no-irish-need-apply.html|title=1854: No Irish Need Apply|last=Bulik|first=Mark|date=2015-09-08|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-01-28|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n====== Public Relations ======\n[[History of public relations|Public influence]] has been part of human civilization since ancient times, but the modern public relations industry traces its roots to a Boston-based PR firm called The Publicity Bureau that opened in 1900.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cutlip|first=Scott M.|date=2016-08-29|title=The Nation's First Public Relations Firm|journal=Journalism Quarterly|volume=43|issue=2|pages=269\u2013280|language=en|doi=10.1177/107769906604300208}}</ref> Although a PR firm may not identify its role as storytelling, the firm\u2019s task is to control the public narrative about the organization they represent.\n\n====== Networking ======\nNetworking has been around since the industrial revolution when businesses recognized the need--and the benefit--of collaborating and trusting a wider range of people.<ref name=\":2\">Phillips, Deborah R. \"The transformational power of networking in today's business world.\" Journal of Property Management, Mar.-Apr. 2017, p. 20+.
