Accordingly, the [[jinn]] preceded humanity, but God decided to replace them, due to their malevolence. Whereupon God sent an army of angels to annihilate the rule of jinn. [[Iblis]], the future devil, plays a significant role in this story, either as the angel, who led his army into battle against the jinn, whereafter he declined to acknowledge the dignity of their successors, or as one of the few pious jinn, which were spared by the angels, but became an infidel, by opposing his successor.<ref>Patricia Crone ''The Qur\u02be\u0101nic Pagans and Related Matters: Collected Studies in Three Volumes, Band 1'' BRILL, 09.06.2016 {{ISBN|9789004319288}} p. 200</ref><ref>Mahmoud Ayoub ''The Qur'an and Its Interpreters , Volume 1'' SUNY Press, 1984 {{ISBN|9780873957274}} p. 73</ref><ref>Brannon Wheeler ''Prophets in the Quran: An Introduction to the Quran and Muslim Exegesis'' A&C Black 2002 {{ISBN|9780826449566}} Page 16</ref>\n*''Deputy'': Adam and his descendants are thought of as the deputy of God.

The Quranic counterpart of the [[fall of man]] differs in some regards from the [[Book of Genesis]]. The Quran does not blame women for seducing men, since both Adam and his wife, whose name is not mentioned in the Quran at all, eat from the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil|forbidden tree]]. Further, the forbidden tree is not identified as ''Tree of the knowledge of good and evil'' but as ''Tree of Eternity''. The Quran does not mention the serpent as a symbol for the devil, but only [[Satan#Islam|Satan]] himself. While the [[Old Testament]] curses the earth for Adams transgression, according to the Quran, God declares the earth as a dwelling place for humans, but not curses it nor is Adam destined to die for his [[sin]],<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Patricia Crone ''Medieval Islamic Political Thought'' Edinburgh University Press, 11.03.2014 {{ISBN|9780748696505}}</ref> thus lacking the doctrine of [[original sin]], prevailing in [[Christian theology]].

According to a common narrative, God ordered the [[Archangels]] to collect a handful of soil from earth. But every time an archangel approached earth, the earth sought refuge in God, that it might not be distorted. All the archangels returned empty-handed, except [[Azrael]], who succeeded because he sought refuge in God before, for that he will not returned unsuccessful.<ref>Scott B. Noegel, Brannon M.

Adam's wife is commonly named ''Hawa'', and the serpent reappears together with a peacock as two animals, which supported Iblis to slip into Adam's abode.<ref>Amira El-Zein Islam, ''Arabs, and Intelligent World of the Jinn Syracuse University'' Press 2009 {{ISBN|9780815650706}} page 98-99</ref> Many denied, that the Garden in which Adam dwelled with his wife, was identical with the [[Jannah|Paradise]] in [[afterlife]]. They rather lived in paradisical conditions before their fall, while after their fall, they need to work to survive. Unlike [[Christian mythology]], in Islamic thought, they did not simply walk out of paradise, but fell out of it. Hawa was punished with childbirth, menstruation and stupidity, while Adam became bald<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> and the serpent lost its legs.\n\nRegarding the creation of Muhammad, Islam developed the belief in the pre-existence of Muhammad.{{efn|The idea of Pre-Islamic Muhammad in deeply rooted in Islamic tradition and already attested in the Sunni-canonical collection (al-Tirmidhi).

Accordingly, the [[jinn]] preceded humanity, but God decided to replace them, due to their malevolence. Whereupon God sent an army of angels to annihilate the rule of jinn. [[Iblis]], the future devil, plays a significant role in this story, either as the angel, who led his army into battle against the jinn, whereafter he declined to acknowledge the dignity of their successors, or as one of the few pious jinn, which were spared by the angels, but became an infidel, by opposing his successor.<ref>Patricia Crone ''The Qur\u02be\u0101nic Pagans and Related Matters: Collected Studies in Three Volumes, Band 1'' BRILL, 09.06.2016 {{ISBN|9789004319288}} p. 200</ref><ref>Mahmoud Ayoub ''The Qur'an and Its Interpreters , Volume 1'' SUNY Press, 1984 {{ISBN|9780873957274}} p. 73</ref><ref>Brannon Wheeler ''Prophets in the Quran: An Introduction to the Quran and Muslim Exegesis'' A&C Black 2002 {{ISBN|9780826449566}} Page 16</ref>\n*''Deputy'': Adam and his descendants are thought of as the deputy of God.

The Quranic counterpart of the [[fall of man]] differs in some regards from the [[Book of Genesis]]. The Quran does not blame women for seducing men, since both Adam and his wife, whose name is not mentioned in the Quran at all, eat from the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil|forbidden tree]]. Further, the forbidden tree is not identified as ''Tree of the knowledge of good and evil'' but as ''Tree of Eternity''. The Quran does not mention the serpent as a symbol for the devil, but only [[Satan#Islam|Satan]] himself.

According to a common narrative, God ordered the [[Archangels]] to collect a handful of soil from earth. But every time an archangel approached earth, the earth sought refuge in God, that it might not be distorted. All the archangels returned empty-handed, except [[Azrael]], who succeeded because he sought refuge in God before, for that he will not returned unsuccessful.<ref>Scott B. Noegel, Brannon M.

Adam's wife is commonly named ''Hawa'', and the serpent reappears together with a peacock as two animals, which supported Iblis to slip into Adam's abode.<ref>Amira El-Zein Islam, ''Arabs, and Intelligent World of the Jinn Syracuse University'' Press 2009 {{ISBN|9780815650706}} page 98-99</ref> Many denied, that the Garden in which Adam dwelled with his wife, was identical with the [[Jannah|Paradise]] in [[afterlife]]. They rather lived in paradisical conditions before their fall, while after their fall, they need to work to survive. Unlike [[Christian mythology]], in Islamic thought, they did not simply walk out of paradise, but fell out of it. Hawa was punished with childbirth, menstruation and stupidity, while Adam became bald<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> and the serpent lost its legs.\n\nRegarding the creation of Muhammad, Islam developed the belief in the pre-existence of Muhammad.{{efn|The idea of Pre-Islamic Muhammad in deeply rooted in Islamic tradition and already attested in the Sunni-canonical collection (al-Tirmidhi).

Named in [[1996 in paleontology|1996]] by Canadian [[paleontologist]] [[Dale Russell]], it contains a single [[species]], '''''Sigilmassasaurus brevicollis'''''. The identity of the genus has been debated by scientists, with some considering its fossils to represent material from the closely related species [[Spinosaurus Aegyptiacus|''Spinosaurus aegyptiacus'']], while others have classified it as a separate taxon, forming the clade [[Spinosaurini]] with ''Spinosaurus'' as its [[sister taxon]].\n\n''Sigilmassasaurus'' was a moderately-built, ground-dwelling, [[bipedal]] [[carnivore]], like most other theropods. It may have had strong neck musculature as evidenced by the [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] of its [[Vertebra|vertebrae]] (backbones). ''Sigilmassasaurus'' may have had [[semiaquatic]] habits and a largely [[piscivorous]] (fish-eating) diet. It coexisted with other large theropods in the [[Kem Kem Formation]].\n\n== History of research ==\n[[Fossil]]s of this dinosaur were recovered at the [[Kem Kem Formation]] in the [[Tafilalt]] [[Oasis]] region of [[Morocco]], near the site of the ancient city of [[Sijilmassa]], for which it was named. Canadian [[paleontologist]] [[Dale Russell]] named ''Sigilmassasaurus'' in 1996, from the ancient city and the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''sauros'' (\"lizard\"). A single [[species]] was named, ''S. brevicollis'', which is derived from the [[Latin]] ''brevis'' (\"short\") and ''collum'' (\"neck\"), because the neck [[vertebra]]e are very short from front to back.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Russell|first=D.A.|date=1996|title=Isolated Dinosaur bones from the Middle Cretaceous of the Tafilalt, Morocco|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282407346|journal=Bulletin du Mus\u00e9um National d'Histoire Naturelle, Section C|volume=18|pages=349\u2013402|via=}}</ref> ''Sigilmassasaurus'' comes from red sandstone sediments in southern Morocco, which are known by various names, including the ''Gr\u00e8s rouges infrac\u00e9nomaniens'', Continental Red Beds, and lower [[Kem Kem Beds]].

Named in [[1996 in paleontology|1996]] by Canadian [[paleontologist]] [[Dale Russell]], it contains a single [[species]], '''''Sigilmassasaurus brevicollis'''''. The identity of the genus has been debated by scientists, with some considering its fossils to represent material from the closely related species [[Spinosaurus Aegyptiacus|''Spinosaurus aegyptiacus'']], while others have classified it as a separate taxon, forming the clade [[Spinosaurini]] with ''Spinosaurus'' as its [[sister taxon]].\n\n''Sigilmassasaurus'' was a moderately-built, ground-dwelling, [[bipedal]] [[carnivore]], like most other theropods. It may have had strong neck musculature as evidenced by the [[morphology]] of its [[Vertebra|vertebrae]] (backbones). ''Sigilmassasaurus'' may have had [[semiaquatic]] habits and a largely [[piscivorous]] (fish-eating) diet. It coexisted with other large theropods in the [[Kem Kem Formation]].\n\n== History of research ==\n[[Fossil]]s of this dinosaur were recovered at the [[Kem Kem Formation]] in the [[Tafilalt]] [[Oasis]] region of [[Morocco]], near the site of the ancient city of [[Sijilmassa]], for which it was named. Canadian [[paleontologist]] [[Dale Russell]] named ''Sigilmassasaurus'' in 1996, from the ancient city and the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''sauros'' (\"lizard\"). A single [[species]] was named, ''S. brevicollis'', which is derived from the [[Latin]] ''brevis'' (\"short\") and ''collum'' (\"neck\"), because the neck [[vertebra]]e are very short from front to back.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Russell|first=D.A.|date=1996|title=Isolated Dinosaur bones from the Middle Cretaceous of the Tafilalt, Morocco|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282407346|journal=Bulletin du Mus\u00e9um National d'Histoire Naturelle, Section C|volume=18|pages=349\u2013402|via=}}</ref> ''Sigilmassasaurus'' comes from red sandstone sediments in southern Morocco, which are known by various names, including the ''Gr\u00e8s rouges infrac\u00e9nomaniens'', Continental Red Beds, and lower [[Kem Kem Beds]].

The generated boxplot figure of our example on the left with no outliers.]]\nA series of hourly temperatures were measured throughout the day in degrees Fahrenheit. The recorded values are listed in order as follows: 50, 50, 55, 58, 63, 66, 66, 67, 67, 68, 69, 70, 70, 70, 70, 72, 73, 75, 75, 76, 76, 78, 79, 81.\n\nA box plot of the data can be generated by calculating five relevant values: minimum, maximum, median, first quartile, and third quartile.\n\nThe minimum is the smallest number of the set. In this case, the minimum day temperature is 50&nbsp;\u00b0F.\n\nThe maximum is the largest number of the set. In this case, the maximum day temperature is 81&nbsp;\u00b0F.\n\nThe median is the \"middle\" number of the ordered set. This means that there are exactly 50% of the elements less than the median and 50% of the elements greater than the median. The median of this ordered set is 70&nbsp;\u00b0F.\n\nThe first quartile value is the number that marks one quarter of the ordered set. In other words, there are exactly 25% of the elements that are less than the first quartile and exactly 75% of the elements that are greater. The first quartile value can easily be determined by finding the \"middle\" number between the minimum and the median. For the hourly temperatures, the \"middle\" number between 50&nbsp;\u00b0F and 70&nbsp;\u00b0F is 66&nbsp;\u00b0F.\n\nThe third quartile value is the number that marks three quarters of the ordered set. In other words, there are exactly 75% of the elements that are less than the first quartile and 25% of the elements that are greater. The third quartile value can be easily determined by finding the \"middle\" number between the median and the maximum. For the hourly temperatures, the \"middle\" number between 70&nbsp;\u00b0F and 81&nbsp;\u00b0F is 75&nbsp;\u00b0F.\n\nThe interquartile range, or IQR, can be calculated:\n\n<math>IQR = Q3 - Q1=75^\\circ F-66^\\circ F=9^\\circ F</math>\n\nHence, <math>1.5IQR=1.5 \\cdot 9^\\circ F=13.5 ^\\circ F</math>.\n\n1.5IQR above the third quartile is:\n\n<math>Q3+1.5IQR=75^\\circ F+13.5^\\circ F=88.5^\\circ F</math>.\n\n1.5IQR below the first quartile is:\n\n<math>Q1-1.5IQR=66^\\circ F-13.5^\\circ F=52.5^\\circ F</math>.\n\nThe upper whisker of the box plot is the largest dataset number smaller than 1.5IQR above the third quartile. Here, 1.5IQR above the third quartile is 88.5&nbsp;\u00b0F and the maximum is 81&nbsp;\u00b0F. Therefore, the upper whisker is drawn at the value of the maximum, 81&nbsp;\u00b0F.\n\nSimilarly, the lower whisker of the box plot is the smallest dataset number larger than 1.5IQR below the first quartile. Here, 1.5IQR below the first quartile is 52.5&nbsp;\u00b0F and the minimum is 50&nbsp;\u00b0F. Therefore, the lower whisker is drawn at the value of the smallest dataset number larger than 52.5&nbsp;\u00b0F, 55&nbsp;\u00b0F.\n\n=== Example with outliers ===\n[[File:Boxplot with outlier.png|thumb|318x318px|Figure 6. The generated boxplot of our example on the left with outliers.]]\nAbove is an example without outliers. Here is a followup example with outliers:\n\nThe ordered set is: 52, 57, 57, 58, 63, 66, 66, 67, 67, 68, 69, 70, 70, 70, 70, 72, 73, 75, 75, 76, 76, 78, 79, 89.\n\nIn this example, only the first and the last number are changed. The median, third quartile, and first quartile remain the same.\n\nIn this case, the maximum is 90&nbsp;\u00b0F and 1.5IQR above the third quartile is 88.5&nbsp;\u00b0F. The maximum is greater than 1.5IQR plus the third quartile, so the maximum is an outlier. Therefore, the upper whisker is drawn at the greatest value smaller than 1.5IQR above the third quartile, which is 79&nbsp;\u00b0F.\n\nSimilarly, the minimum is 52&nbsp;\u00b0F and 1.5IQR below the first quartile is 52.5&nbsp;\u00b0F. The minimum is smaller than 1.5IQR minus the first quartile, so the minimum is also an outlier. Therefore, the lower whisker is drawn at the smallest value greater than 1.5IQR below the first quartile, which is 57&nbsp;\u00b0F.\n\n=== In the case of large datasets ===\n\n==== General equation to compute empirical quantiles ====\n<math>q_n(p) = x_{(k)} + \\alpha(x_{(k+1)} - x_{(k)})</math>\n\n<math>\\text{with} \\ k = [p(n+1)] \\ \\text{and} \\ \\alpha = p(n+1) - k</math>\n\nUsing the example from above with 24 data points, meaning n = 24, one can also calculate the median, first and third quantile mathematically vs. visually.\n\n'''Median''' : <math>q_n(0.5) = q_{(12)} + (0.5\\cdot25-12)\\cdot(x_{(13)}-x_{(12)})\n= 70+(0.5\\cdot25-12)\\cdot(70-70) = 70</math>\n\n'''First Quantile''' : <math>q_n(0.25) = q_{(6)} + (0.25\\cdot25-6)\\cdot(x_{(7)}-x_{(6)})\n= 66 +(0.25\\cdot25 - 6)\\cdot(66-66) = 66</math>\n\n'''Third Quantile''' : <math>q_n(0.75) = q_{(18)} + (0.75\\cdot25-18)\\cdot(x_{(19)}-x_{(18)})\n=75 + (0.75\\cdot25-18)\\cdot(75-75) = 75</math>\n\n== Visualization ==\n\n[[Image:Boxplot vs PDF.svg|thumb|Figure 7. Boxplot and a [[probability density function]] (pdf) of a Normal N(0,1\u03c3<sup>2</sup>) Population]]\n\nThe box plot allows quick graphical examination of one or more data sets.  Box plots may seem more primitive than a [[histogram]] or [[kernel density estimation|kernel density estimate]] but they do have some advantages.  They take up less space and are therefore particularly useful for comparing distributions between several groups or sets of data (see Figure 1 for an example). Choice of [[Histogram#Number of bins and width|number and width of bins]] techniques can heavily influence the appearance of a histogram, and choice of bandwidth can heavily influence the appearance of a kernel density estimate.\n\nAs looking at a statistical distribution is more commonplace than looking at a box plot, comparing the box plot against the probability density function (theoretical histogram) for a normal N(0,\u03c3<sup>2</sup>) distribution may be a useful tool for understanding the box plot (Figure 7).\n[[File:Boxplots with skewness.png|thumb|Figure 8.

Notches are useful in offering a rough guide to significance of difference of medians; if the notches of two boxes do not overlap, this offers evidence of a statistically significant difference between the medians.<ref name=\"mcgill tukey larsen\" /> The width of the notches is proportional to the interquartile range (IQR) of the sample and inversely proportional to the square root of the size of the sample. However, there is uncertainty about the most appropriate multiplier (as this may vary depending on the similarity of the variances of the samples).<ref name=\"mcgill tukey larsen\" /> One convention is to use <math alt=\"&plusmn;1.58*IQR/sqrt(n)\">\\pm \\frac{1.58 IQR}{\\sqrt{n}}</math>.<ref name=\"Rboxplotstats\">{{Cite web | title = R: Box Plot Statistics | work = R manual | url = http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/grDevices/html/boxplot.stats.html | accessdate = 26 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nAdjusted box plots are intended for [[skewness|skew distributions]].

The generated boxplot figure of our example on the left with no outliers.]]\nA series of hourly temperatures were measured throughout the day in degrees Fahrenheit. The recorded values are listed in order as follows: 50, 50, 55, 58, 63, 66, 66, 67, 67, 68, 69, 70, 70, 70, 70, 72, 73, 75, 75, 76, 76, 78, 79, 81.\n\nA box plot of the data can be generated by calculating five relevant values: minimum, maximum, median, first quartile, and third quartile.\n\nThe minimum is the smallest number of the set. In this case, the minimum day temperature is 50&nbsp;\u00b0F.\n\nThe maximum is the largest number of the set. In this case, the maximum day temperature is 81&nbsp;\u00b0F.\n\nThe median is the \"middle\" number of the ordered set. This means that there are exactly 50% of the elements less than the median and 50% of the elements greater than the median. The median of this ordered set is 70&nbsp;\u00b0F.\n\nThe first quartile value is the number that marks one quarter of the ordered set. In other words, there are exactly 25% of the elements that are less than the first quartile and exactly 75% of the elements that are greater. The first quartile value can easily be determined by finding the \"middle\" number between the minimum and the median. For the hourly temperatures, the \"middle\" number between 50&nbsp;\u00b0F and 70&nbsp;\u00b0F is 66&nbsp;\u00b0F.\n\nThe third quartile value is the number that marks three quarters of the ordered set. In other words, there are exactly 75% of the elements that are less than the first quartile and 25% of the elements that are greater. The third quartile value can be easily determined by finding the \"middle\" number between the median and the maximum. For the hourly temperatures, the \"middle\" number between 70&nbsp;\u00b0F and 81&nbsp;\u00b0F is 75&nbsp;\u00b0F.\n\nThe interquartile range, or IQR, can be calculated:\n\n<math>IQR = Q3 - Q1=75^\\circ F-66^\\circ F=9^\\circ F</math>\n\nHence, <math>1.5IQR=1.5 \\cdot 9^\\circ F=13.5 ^\\circ F</math>.\n\n1.5IQR above the third quartile is:\n\n<math>Q3+1.5IQR=75^\\circ F+13.5^\\circ F=88.5^\\circ F</math>.\n\n1.5IQR below the first quartile is:\n\n<math>Q1-1.5IQR=66^\\circ F-13.5^\\circ F=52.5^\\circ F</math>.\n\nThe upper whisker of the box plot is the largest dataset number smaller than 1.5IQR above the third quartile. Here, 1.5IQR above the third quartile is 88.5&nbsp;\u00b0F and the maximum is 81&nbsp;\u00b0F. Therefore, the upper whisker is drawn at the value of the maximum, 81&nbsp;\u00b0F.\n\nSimilarly, the lower whisker of the box plot is the smallest dataset number larger than 1.5IQR below the first quartile. Here, 1.5IQR below the first quartile is 52.5&nbsp;\u00b0F and the minimum is 50&nbsp;\u00b0F. Therefore, the lower whisker is drawn at the value of the smallest dataset number larger than 52.5&nbsp;\u00b0F, 55&nbsp;\u00b0F.\n\n=== Example with outliers ===\n[[File:Boxplot with outlier.png|thumb|318x318px|Figure 6. The generated boxplot of our example on the left with outliers.]]\nAbove is an example without outliers. Here is a followup example with outliers:\n\nThe ordered set is: 52, 57, 57, 58, 63, 66, 66, 67, 67, 68, 69, 70, 70, 70, 70, 72, 73, 75, 75, 76, 76, 78, 79, 89.\n\nIn this example, only the first and the last number are changed. The median, third quartile, and first quartile remain the same.\n\nIn this case, the maximum is 90&nbsp;\u00b0F and 1.5IQR above the third quartile is 88.5&nbsp;\u00b0F. The maximum is greater than 1.5IQR plus the third quartile, so the maximum is an outlier. Therefore, the upper whisker is drawn at the greatest value smaller than 1.5IQR above the third quartile, which is 79&nbsp;\u00b0F.\n\nSimilarly, the minimum is 52&nbsp;\u00b0F and 1.5IQR below the first quartile is 52.5&nbsp;\u00b0F. The minimum is smaller than 1.5IQR minus the first quartile, so the minimum is also an outlier. Therefore, the lower whisker is drawn at the smallest value greater than 1.5IQR below the first quartile, which is 57&nbsp;\u00b0F.\n\n=== In the case of large datasets ===\n\n==== General equation to compute empirical quantiles ====\n<math>q_n(p) = x_{(k)} + \\alpha(x_{(k+1)} - x_{(k)})</math>\n\n<math>\\text{with} \\ k = [p(n+1)] \\ \\text{and} \\ \\alpha = p(n+1) - k</math>\n\nUsing the example from above with 24 data points, meaning n = 24, one can also calculate the median, first and third quantile mathematically vs. visually.\n\n'''Median''' : <math>q_n(0.5) = q_{(12)} + (0.5\\cdot25-12)\\cdot(x_{(13)}-x_{(12)})\n= 70+(0.5\\cdot25-12)\\cdot(70-70) = 70</math>\n\n'''First Quantile''' : <math>q_n(0.25) = q_{(6)} + (0.25\\cdot25-6)\\cdot(x_{(7)}-x_{(6)})\n= 66 +(0.25\\cdot25 - 6)\\cdot(66-66) = 66</math>\n\n'''Third Quantile''' : <math>q_n(0.75) = q_{(18)} + (0.75\\cdot25-18)\\cdot(x_{(19)}-x_{(18)})\n=75 + (0.75\\cdot25-18)\\cdot(75-75) = 75</math>\n\n== Visualization ==\n\n[[Image:Boxplot vs PDF.svg|thumb|Figure 7. Boxplot and a [[probability density function]] (pdf) of a Normal N(0,1\u03c3<sup>2</sup>) Population]]\n\nThe box plot allows quick graphical examination of one or more data sets.  Box plots may seem more primitive than a [[histogram]] or [[kernel density estimation|kernel density estimate]] but they do have some advantages.  They take up less space and are therefore particularly useful for comparing distributions between several groups or sets of data (see Figure 1 for an example). Choice of [[Histogram#Number of bins and width|number and width of bins]] techniques can heavily influence the appearance of a histogram, and choice of bandwidth can heavily influence the appearance of a kernel density estimate.\n\nAs looking at a statistical distribution is more commonplace than looking at a box plot, comparing the box plot against the probability density function (theoretical histogram) for a normal N(0,\u03c3<sup>2</sup>) distribution may be a useful tool for understanding the box plot (Figure 7).\n[[File:Boxplots with skewness.png|thumb|Figure 8.

Each is identified by a shield bearing the [[Coat of arms|arms]] of the house, located in the upper right corner of the card.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.agameofthrones.com/agotabout.php| title = What is A Game of Thrones| accessdate = 2007-07-16 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070627223512/http://www.agameofthrones.com/agotabout.php |archivedate = 2007-06-27}}</ref>\n\n===Great houses===\n* [[House Stark]], the honorable rulers of the cold [[the North (A Song of Ice and Fire)|North]]. The Stark shield is a grey [[direwolf (fictional creature)|direwolf]] on an ice-white field. Prominent Stark characters include Lord [[Eddard Stark]] and his wife [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]], their son [[Robb Stark|Robb]], as well as [[Maester Luwin]], Ser [[Rodrik Cassel]], and [[Brynden Tully|Brynden \"The Blackfish\" Tully]]. Common game mechanics include direct kill, deck searching, and improved defense. Many Stark effects are themed around military challenges.\n* [[House Lannister]], the rich and treacherous residents of [[Casterly Rock]]. The Lannister shield is a gold lion on a crimson field. Prominent Lannister characters include [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]], [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]], and [[Tyrion Lannister]], as well as Ser [[Gregor Clegane]], Ser [[Addam Marbrand]], and [[Grand Maester Pycelle]]. Common game mechanics include card draw, kneeling effects, and trait manipulation. Many Lannister effects are themed around intrigue challenges.\n* [[House Baratheon]], the royal blood of King [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]], rulers of [[Dragonstone (A Song of Ice and Fire)|Dragonstone]] and [[Storm's End]]. The Baratheon shield is a black crowned stag on a gold field. Prominent Baratheon characters include Robert, his brothers [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] and [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]], as well as [[Melisandre]], Ser [[Davos Seaworth]], and the [[Loras Tyrell|Loras Tyrell, the Knight of Flowers]]. Common game mechanics include power manipulation, standing effects, and retrieval of cards from the dead and discard piles. Many House Baratheon effects are themed around power challenges.\n* [[House Greyjoy]], the rulers of the [[Iron Islands]] and the [[Ironborn]] raiders who prey on the rest of Westeros. The Greyjoy shield is a gold [[kraken]] on a black field. Prominent Greyjoy characters include [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]], [[Asha Greyjoy|Asha]], and their father [[Balon Greyjoy]], as well Balon's brothers [[Euron Greyjoy|Euron Crow's Eye]] and [[Aeron Damphair]]. Common game mechanics include location control, the ability to save characters, event cancels, and boosting the strength of attacking characters. Many house Greyjoy effects are themed around winning unopposed challenges.\n* [[House Targaryen]], the exiled descendants of [[Aegon the Conqueror]] and their exotic followers. The Targaryen shield is a red on black, three-headed [[dragon]] representing Aegon and his sisters. Prominent Targaryen characters include [[Daenerys Targaryen]] and her three dragons, [[Khal Drogo]], Ser [[Jorah Mormont]], and [[Grey Worm]]. Common game mechanics include attachment manipulation, strength reducers and kill effects on strength 0 characters (frequently referred to as \"burn\" effects), and playing characters outside of the marshalling phase. Many Targaryen effects are themed around winning or losing challenges by 4 or more strength.\n* [[House Martell]], rulers of the desert realm of [[Dorne]], the southernmost region of Westeros. The Martell shield is a red sun pierced by a golden spear, on an orange field. Prominent Martell characters include [[Doran Martell]], [[Oberyn Martell|Oberyn Martell the Red Viper]], his daughters the [[Sand Snakes]], and his niece [[Arianne Martell]]. Common game mechanics include icon manipulation, discard effects, stealth, and card draw. Many Martell effects are themed around losing challenges, leading to such effects being referred to as \"revenge\" effects.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.agameofthrones.com/PDF/agotnewplayerguide.pdf| title = Beginner's Guide| accessdate = 2007-07-16| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070821033507/http://www.agameofthrones.com/PDF/agotnewplayerguide.pdf| archivedate = 21 August 2007| url-status = dead}}</ref>\n\n===Other factions===\nSome great houses featured in ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' are not represented as individual Houses in the ''AGoT'' LCG, but still appear in the game. [[House Tully]] is present in the game as a subset of their allies, House Stark.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.tzumainn.com/agot/cards/card-search.php?set=&house=&card_rarity=&order=card_set&card_type=&search_name=&traits=House+Tully&search_text=| title = A Game of Thrones Card Search (House Tully) | accessdate = 2007-07-16}}</ref> House Lannister and House Baratheon both feature numerous [[House Tyrell]] cards, and several significant House Tyrell characters were featured as promotional cards.

Example: The [[Wildlings]] are featured in ''Winter Block'',<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.agameofthrones.com/designer_journal072205.php| title = Winter Edition Teaser| accessdate = 2007-07-16 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927004511/http://www.agameofthrones.com/designer_journal072205.php |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}</ref> while the [[Asshai'i]] have been a sub theme over many expansions.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.tzumainn.com/agot/cards/card-search.php?set=&house=&card_rarity=&order=card_set&card_type=&search_name=&traits=Asshai&search_text=| title = A Game of Thrones CCG Search (Asshai)| accessdate = 2007-07-16}}</ref>\n\n==Cards==\nEach player supplies his or her own deck to play the game. A deck consists of a ''House Card'' or ''Alliance'' to represent the player's faction, an optional ''Agenda'' that modifies his faction, a plot deck that consists of exactly seven ''Plot'' cards, and then a main draw deck of at least 60 cards consisting of ''Characters'', ''Attachments'', ''Locations'', and ''Events''.\n\n===House cards===\nEach House card represents one of the main factions involved in the [[War of the Five Kings]]. Each House provides different strengths and weaknesses, allowing for various playstyles to interact within the same game. The House card selected will often restrict cards allowed in the remainder of the deck, by limiting cards that are marked as being allowed solely for another House.\n\nCharacters, Locations, and Attachments often have a House affiliation, and often are used in decks running a matching House card. Some cards have no House affiliation, and such neutral cards may be used freely in any deck. Cards with House affiliations other than the chosen House card may be used, providing the card itself has no restriction, but require an extra expenditure of resources to bring them into play.\n\n===Agenda cards (optional)===\nIntroduced in Valyrian Block, any deck using a House card (but not an Alliance card) may use one Agenda card. Agenda cards either modify the rules for building the player's deck, or grant an in-game advantage, typically at the cost of some other disadvantage such as requiring extra power to win, reduced card draw, or limiting claimed power.\n\n===Plot cards===\nPlot cards are generally regarded as the defining feature of ''A Game of Thrones: The Card Game''. Unlike the shuffled and randomly drawn resource deck, at the beginning of each round, each player chooses a new plot card to be revealed, which will have an effect on the round to be played, allowing for a strategic element to an otherwise random game.\n\nPlot cards indicate the base amount of gold available for the player to use to bring new cards into play during his ''Marshalling'' phase (indicated by a number within a gold coin), a base initiative value to determine the order of play for the round (indicated by a number within a diamond), a base claim value to determine the scope of the effect that player winning a challenge (indicated by a number in a silver disk), and a text box detailing any other effects or restrictions on the plot card, including any ''traits'' that it might have.\n\nMost plot cards are designed with built-in trade-offs, sacrificing high claim for low income, or some other game mechanic drawback.\n\n===Character cards===\nCharacter cards represent the unique characters from the ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' novels, such as Eddard Stark, as well as generic individuals and massed groupings (such as armies) that can be found there. Generally, characters are the main focus of a deck as they are the principle card type used to participate in challenges, and thus collect the power tokens necessary to win.\n\nAttributes of a Character card consist of a gold cost (generally represented by a number overlaid on a gold coin in the upper left corner), a name across the top that may be preceded by a black flag if the character is unique and/or an infinity symbol if the character is ''endless'', a House affiliation (represented by one or more House shields in the upper right corner, although neutral characters will have a blank shield), artwork depicting the character in the top half of the card, a strength value (represented by a number on a stylized tapestry or a nondescript shield in the middle of the left side), zero to three challenge icons (a red axe represents Military, a green eye represents Intrigue, and a blue crown represents Power) arrayed in the bottom half of the left side, and a text box in the lower half of the card.\n\nWithin the textbox may be ''traits'', ''keywords'', other game effects or icons, and flavour text from the novels. Traits are bold and italicized words at the top of the textbox, and usually represent roles or groups within the world of ''A Song of Ice and Fire'', such as Lords or [[Dothraki language|Dothraki]]. They have no game function themselves, but instead are used to group characters together in order for other game effects to be used by or against varied groups of characters. Keywords are game mechanics defined in the rules that affect that character, such as No Attachments, which prevents any attachments from being placed on that character.\n\n===Attachment cards===\nAttachments are cards that are used exclusively to modify other cards. An attachment may not be in play unless it is attached to the proper type of card, typically a character card unless the attachment itself says otherwise.\n\nAttributes of an Attachment card consist of a gold cost (generally represented by a number overlaid on a gold coin in the upper left corner), a name across the top that may be proceeded by a black flag if the attachment is unique and/or an infinity symbol if the attachment is ''endless'', a House affiliation (represented by one or more House shields in the upper right corner, although neutral attachments will have no shield), artwork depicting the attachment in the top half of the card, and a text box in the lower half of the card. Throughout the Winter block, some cards were printed with a black crow icon in the bottom left corner to indicate the attachment is ''Doomed''. It is unknown if such attachments will appear again.\n\nWithin the textbox may be ''traits'', ''keywords'', other game effects or icons, and flavour text from the novels. Traits are bold and italicized words at the top of the textbox, and usually represent types of enhancements, such as skills or titles. They have no game function themselves, but instead are used to group attachments together in order for other game effects to be used by or against varied groups of attachments. Keywords are game mechanics defined in the rules that affect that attachment such as Setup, which allows the attachment to be played at the beginning of the game unlike normal attachments.\n\nOccasionally, game effects can cause cards to become face-down attachments attached to specific other cards. These function the same as normal attachments, except they are treated as having no names, no text, no gold costs, no House affiliations, and are discarded if they are ever forced to leave play.\n\n===Location cards===\nLocation cards represent the unique places in the setting of the ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' novels, such as [[King's Landing (A Song of Ice and Fire)|King's Landing]], generic regions such as [[fiefdoms]], and even mobile locations such as sailing [[watercraft|vessels]] and [[warships]]. Many locations are used to supply additional ''income'', ''influence'', but a wide variety of effects are present.\n\nAttributes of a Location card consist of a gold cost (generally represented by a number overlaid on a gold coin in the upper left corner), a name across the top that may be preceded by a black flag if the location is unique, a House affiliation (represented by one or more House shields in the upper right corner, although neutral locations will have no shield), artwork depicting the location in the top half of the card, and a text box in the lower half of the card.\n\nWithin the textbox may be ''traits'', ''keywords'', other game effects or icons, and flavour text from the novels. Traits are bold and italicized words at the top of the textbox, and usually represent regions within the world of A Song of Ice and Fire, such as Westeros or Dorne. They have no game function themselves, but instead are used to group locations together in order for other game effects to be used by or against varied groups of locations. Keywords are game mechanics defined in the rules that affect that location, such as Limited which restricts the player to playing one such card per round.\n\n===Event cards===\nEvent cards represent special actions or happenings from the ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' novels that can be used in the course of the game. Certain events may be restricted so that they may only be played by a specific House, and some may only affect cards of a particular House affiliation. Event cards generally have a play restriction or a cost of some type which may be paid in influence, gold, or possibly by modifying the game state of one or more characters, locations, attachments or house card.\n\nAttributes of an Event card consist of a name across the top that may be preceded by a black flag if the event is unique and/or an infinity symbol if the event is ''endless'', artwork depicting the event in the top half of the card, and a text box in the lower half of the card.\n\nWithin the textbox may be ''traits'', ''keywords'', but primarily will be one or more game effects, and flavour text from the novels. Traits are bold and italicized words at the top of the textbox, and usually represent specific types of events such as ''Small Council''. They have no game function themselves, but instead are used to group events together in order for other game effects to be used by or against varied groups of events. Keywords are game mechanics defined in the rules that affect that event, such as Deathbound directing a used event to the dead pile instead of the normal discard pile.\n\n==Rules==\n\n===Deck building===\nEach player participating in an A Game of Thrones game uses two decks: 1) a 7 card ''plot'' deck and 2) a 60+ (40+ for draft) card ''draw'' deck of ''characters'', ''attachments'', ''locations'', and ''events''. During play the ''draw'' deck cards will often end up in other game play areas including the ''discard pile'' (cards discarded from play) and the ''dead pile'' (cards that were killed or are marked with the Deathbound keyword). Typically, players are only allowed three copies of any particular card (as determined by the card name, regardless of card type or game text similarity) in their ''draw'' deck, and only one copy of any particular card, by name, in their ''plot'' deck, but these restrictions can be modified by some other cards, such as the Twins agenda.\n\n===Winning conditions===\nA player must earn 15 power tokens between their House card and characters in play to win A Game of Thrones. Numerous cards in the game can change the amount a player or his opponent are required to earn in order to win. Generally, power tokens are earned by winning challenges against an opponent, but some cards allow a player to directly claim power for his House card or characters in other ways.\n\n===Setup===\nAt the beginning of the game, each player shuffles their ''draw'' deck, and draws the top 7 cards, with an option for a ''[[mulligan (games)|mulligan]]'' given to each player to shuffle and draw a new hand. From this initial hand, each player is able to select up to 5 gold worth of characters, locations, and attachments with the Setup keyword, but no more than 1 card of any type with the Limited keyword, from their hand; these cards are placed face-down until all players are ready to reveal their initial cards in play. Once all cards are revealed, players draw cards again until they each have 7 cards in their hand again.\n\n===Rounds and phases===\nThe game is played through repeated rounds until one or more players meets the winning condition, or all but one player has met the elimination condition. Rounds are divided into 7 phases, with each phase allowing players to alternate actions that affect the game state in some way.\n\nThe first phase every round is the ''Plot'' phase. Each player selects one unused plot from his ''plot'' deck, and all players reveal their chosen plots simultaneously. Initiative values from plot cards and other resources are tallied, and the player with the highest initiative chooses which player will go first in each phase of the current round. The textbox effects of plots are then resolved in the order chosen by the first player.\n\nIn the second phase, the ''Draw'' phase, each player is allowed to draw two cards from their ''draw'' deck.\n\nAlthough divided into turns for each player, the ''Marshalling'' phase is a single phase for all players. At the beginning of each player's turn in the Marshalling phase, the player counts all income from plot card and any other resources available. The player is then able to bring new resources in the form of characters, locations, and attachments into play by spending the gold. Some events and other triggered effects also require the payment of gold, and unused income is not carried over into other rounds, so resource management is important.\n\nThe fourth phase is the ''Challenge'' phase. As with the ''Marshalling'' phase, each player has a turn to initiate challenges against other players. Generally, players may initiate one each of ''Military'', ''Intrigue'', and ''Power'' challenges each round, but several cards can allow exta challenges to be initiated or deny certain challenges at all. Also, in a multiplayer game, he can either use all his challenges on one opponent or divide them among his adversaries. He doesn't have to use all of them. Challenges can be initiated in any order, and require a player to ''kneel'' one or more characters with an icon matching the challenge type to begin the challenge. Then, the player being attacked may kneel one or more characters to attempt to oppose the challenge. Once all player actions are taken, the player with the highest total strength in the challenge wins. If the defending player wins, nothing special occurs, but if the attacker wins, then the defender suffers losses depending on the type of challenge initiated.\n* Military - if the defending player loses, he must ''kill'' a number of characters he controls equal to the claim value on the attacker's plot.\n* Intrigue - if the defending player loses, he must randomly discard a number of cards from hand equal to the claim value on the attacker's plot.\n* Power - if the defending player loses, he must remove a number of power tokens from his House card equal to the claim value on the attacker's plot, and place them on the attacker's House card.\n\nIn the fifth phase, the ''Dominance'' phase, each player counts the total strength of all controlled characters that are still ''standing'', plus the amount of gold still remaining in his possession (unspent). The player with the highest total wins dominance that round, and claims 1 power token for his House, taken from the power common pool.\n\nIn the ''Standing'' phase each player changes each ''kneeling'' card to ''standing''.\n\nWith the LCG format came a new phase, the ''Taxation'' phase, in which each player returns unspent gold to the common pool (in the CCG format, players could not use gold outside of their turn in the Marshalling phase).\n\n===Common game terms and rules===\n''Kneeling'' and ''standing'' are the two possible game states for each card in the game, although there is a special ''moribund'' state that's further explained in the faq on FFG website. ''Standing'' cards are upright, and are ready for use to pay for effects, or to initiate or defend challenges. ''Kneeling'' cards are rotated 90 degrees to the side, to indicate that they've been used to pay for an effect, or to initiate or defend a challenge. Some game effects are able to ''kneel'' cards (changing them from ''standing'' to ''kneeling'') or ''stand'' cards (changing them from ''kneeling'' to ''standing'') in order to manipulate the resources a player has available.\n\n''Unique'' cards represent the special individuals, places, items, and happenings in the world of A Song of Ice and Fire. Unique cards may not be played if the player already has a copy of that card in play, or if a copy of that card can be found in the player's dead pile. Unique characters, locations, and attachments may be placed with copies that are already in play to serve as ''duplicates''. Duplicates may be discarded to save the unique card from being killed or discard.\n\n''Triggered Effects'' are a type of game effect that a player chooses to use in order to change the game state in some way. Triggered effects are indicated by a bold name of a phase (one of ''Plot'', ''Draw'', ''Marshalling'', ''Challenges'', ''Dominance'', or ''Standing'') or ''Any phase'' to indicate when the effect may be used. Another timing word that may precede a triggered effect is a bold ''Response'', which indicates that the effect may only be used in response to another occurrence in the game. ''Triggered abilities'' are a subset of triggered effects, and are specifically triggered effects that are written on cards currently in play.\n\n''Passive Effects'' are game effects that have no bold timing restriction indicated, but instead happen whenever certain prerequisites are met, such as a character coming into play.\n\n''Constant Abilities'' are game effects written on cards in play that have an ongoing effect on the game state.\n\n''Influence'' is indicated on various characters, locations, and attachments in the game by a number on a scroll in the textbox of the card. In the Valyrian block, influence was introduced as an additional resource to manage, requiring players to kneel one or more cards with a specific total amount of influence to pay for an effect.\n\nNormally, once a game effect has been initiated, it fully resolves without an interruption. However, once an effect is begun, there is a chance for specific effects to ''Cancel'' the initial effect. If the effect is cancelled, all costs stay paid, use limitations remain, but the effects do not occur.\n\n''Kill'' means removing a character from play, and placing that character in the ''dead pile''. Kill effects only work on characters, including other cards that are currently functioning as characters, but other cards can be placed in the dead pile through various game effects, such as the Deathbound keyword.\n\n''Discard'', when occurring without the modifier ''from hand'', means to take a card that is in play, and place it in the ''discard pile''.\n\nGenerally, whenever an effect targets a card to be killed or discarded, players are given a chance to ''Save'' the card from the effect, either by discarding a duplicate of the targeted card or by using another game effect. If a card is saved, it is not removed from play, and it is not considered killed or discarded.\n\n==Organized play==\n\n===Night's Watch===\n[[Fantasy Flight Games]] has an official group of volunteers that organize sanctioned tournaments for A Game of Thrones. The [[Night's Watch]] are named after the guardians of The Wall in northern Westeros in the fictional setting of ''A Song of Ice and Fire''. These volunteers organize tournaments, arrange demonstration games for new and interested players, and hand out promotional materials provided by FFG.\n\n===Prizes===\n* '''Gold dragons''' are a form of loyalty points that were awarded for purchases and playing in tournaments. The packaging for [[booster packs]], [[starter pack|starter decks]], and premium starter decks all have an image of a gold coin with a number representing the number of gold dragons earned, being one, two, and five respectively. Players could also earn certificates of eighty, forty, and twenty gold dragons for placing first, second, or third (respectively) in a sanctioned tournament. Gold dragons were redeemable to FFG for older promotional cards, booster packs, and other specialized AGoT products, such as card binders, stone house cards, and house-specific power tokens.  The Gold Dragon redemption program officially ended on June 30, 2008.\n* '''Promotional cards''' were frequently provided to Night's Watch volunteers by FFG to be given to participants of sanctioned tournaments. Sometimes these cards follow a special theme for the tournament, but that is not always the case. Usually the cards can legally be included in any deck, but some are marked with a skull icon to indicate they cannot be included unless special rules are in effect for that tournament.\n\n===Tournaments===\nThere are several different official tournament types sanctioned by FFG. In the ''Classic'' format, players bring their own decks, which may include cards from any set, as long as the card is not on the banned list. In ''Standard'' format, players bring their own decks, which may only include cards from the most recent blocks. {{As of|2006|alt=As of August 2006}}, only cards released since Valyrian block are legal in Standard format. In ''Limited'' format, players instead build their decks at the tournament, using provided draft packs (in ''Limited - Draft'') or starter decks (in ''Limited - Sealed Deck'') and booster packs.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.agameofthrones.com/faq.php| title = A Game of Thrones FAQ| accessdate = 2007-07-16 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070627223429/http://www.agameofthrones.com/faq.php |archivedate = 2007-06-27}}</ref>\n\nAside from the restrictions on usable card pool, FFG places no limits on how Night's Watch volunteers organize the tournaments.\n\n[http://www.thrones-tournaments.com Thrones-Tournaments.com] tries to provide a central list of all international and local store tournaments, to help gamers find play to compete in.\n\n===World and Continental Championships===\nThe A Game of Thrones World Championships were held yearly at [[Gen Con]] Indy until 2012, when they moved to Fantasy Flight's Event Centre in [[Minneapolis]], with Gencon being redesignated North American Championships.

He now has a consulting role at FFG.  The runner up in that tournament, Nate French, came on as lead developer in Spring of 2006 and continues to this day.\n\n==Podcasts==\n\nThere are a number of podcasts focused on the ''A Game of Thrones: The Living Card Game'', such as the weekly [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/podcasts/_/game-of-thrones-beyond-the-wall/?sort_col=record_saved&sort_order=desc&per_page=25 Beyond The Wall], [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/podcasts/_/game-of-thrones-podcasts/ 2 Champs and a Chump], [https://soundcloud.com/great-beards-of-westeros Great Beards of Westeros] and the Spanish language [https://soundcloud.com/2maestros1pupilo/ 2 Maestros 1 Pupilo].\n\n==Sets and expansions==\nWhen it was released, A Game of Thrones was introduced as a CCG. The cards for the AGoT CCG were organized into numerous sets and expansions that could be mixed together and used interchangeably. A ''block'' consisted of a ''base set'', up to two ''expansion sets'', a ''premium starter'', and often one or more promotional cards.\n\nTypically, a base set consisted of 240 cards available in either [[starter pack|starter decks]], consisting of a mix of fixed cards and a random assortment of other cards, or [[booster packs]], consisting of 11 randomly sorted cards, of which 1 is rare, 3 are uncommon, and 7 are common. Booster packs were generally shipped in groups of 36, creating booster boxes. Expansion sets typically contained 150 cards, and were only distributed as booster packs similar to those of a base set. Premium Starters consisted of two or three pre-built decks of fixed cards, typically reprints from earlier sets, but also introducing 10 new cards as well.\n\nWithin a base set and expansion set, the cards were divided into groups based on their frequency of appearance, with rare cards being included the least frequent, uncommon cards slightly more frequent, and common cards being the most frequent. Also available in regular and premium starters were a specific number of fixed cards that always appeared in that packaging. Also available were ''draft packs'' which consisted of 1 ''draft'' card, 5 ''plot'' cards, 6 ''house'' cards and 8 ''locations'' that are generally useful to any deck, and allow for a more level competitive field during ''draft'' tournaments.\n\nIn late 2007, the A Game of Thrones CCG was converted to the A Game of Thrones LCG (Living Card Game), which ended the random booster packs in favor of fixed packs, called Chapter Packs, released on a roughly monthly basis. Chapter packs consist of 60 fixed cards - 3 copies of 20 cards. The Core Set consists of 4 preconstructed decks consisting of Stark, Lannister, Baratheon, and Targaryen, and is marketed as a starting point for a new player. It will also include a game board, power tokens, gold tokens, as well as game pieces to use for the multiplayer titles.  Along with the switch to the LCG, there has also been more of a focus on the multiplayer aspect of the game, now referred to as Melee, rather than the head to head play, now referred to as Joust.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ '''A Game of Thrones CCG card sets'''\n!

Many Martell effects are themed around losing challenges, leading to such effects being referred to as \"revenge\" effects.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.agameofthrones.com/PDF/agotnewplayerguide.pdf| title = Beginner's Guide| accessdate = 2007-07-16| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070821033507/http://www.agameofthrones.com/PDF/agotnewplayerguide.pdf| archivedate = 21 August 2007| url-status = dead}}</ref>\n\n===Other factions===\nSome great houses featured in ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' are not represented as individual Houses in the ''AGoT'' LCG, but still appear in the game. [[House Tully]] is present in the game as a subset of their allies, House Stark.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.tzumainn.com/agot/cards/card-search.php?set=&house=&card_rarity=&order=card_set&card_type=&search_name=&traits=House+Tully&search_text=| title = A Game of Thrones Card Search (House Tully) | accessdate = 2007-07-16}}</ref> House Lannister and House Baratheon both feature numerous [[House Tyrell]] cards, and several significant House Tyrell characters were featured as promotional cards.

Example: The [[Wildlings]] are featured in ''Winter Block'',<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.agameofthrones.com/designer_journal072205.php| title = Winter Edition Teaser| accessdate = 2007-07-16 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927004511/http://www.agameofthrones.com/designer_journal072205.php |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}</ref> while the [[Asshai'i]] have been a sub theme over many expansions.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.tzumainn.com/agot/cards/card-search.php?set=&house=&card_rarity=&order=card_set&card_type=&search_name=&traits=Asshai&search_text=| title = A Game of Thrones CCG Search (Asshai)| accessdate = 2007-07-16}}</ref>\n\n==Cards==\nEach player supplies his or her own deck to play the game. A deck consists of a ''House Card'' or ''Alliance'' to represent the player's faction, an optional ''Agenda'' that modifies his faction, a plot deck that consists of exactly seven ''Plot'' cards, and then a main draw deck of at least 60 cards consisting of ''Characters'', ''Attachments'', ''Locations'', and ''Events''.\n\n===House cards===\nEach House card represents one of the main factions involved in the [[War of the Five Kings]]. Each House provides different strengths and weaknesses, allowing for various playstyles to interact within the same game. The House card selected will often restrict cards allowed in the remainder of the deck, by limiting cards that are marked as being allowed solely for another House.\n\nCharacters, Locations, and Attachments often have a House affiliation, and often are used in decks running a matching House card. Some cards have no House affiliation, and such neutral cards may be used freely in any deck. Cards with House affiliations other than the chosen House card may be used, providing the card itself has no restriction, but require an extra expenditure of resources to bring them into play.\n\n===Agenda cards (optional)===\nIntroduced in Valyrian Block, any deck using a House card (but not an Alliance card) may use one Agenda card. Agenda cards either modify the rules for building the player's deck, or grant an in-game advantage, typically at the cost of some other disadvantage such as requiring extra power to win, reduced card draw, or limiting claimed power.\n\n===Plot cards===\nPlot cards are generally regarded as the defining feature of ''A Game of Thrones: The Card Game''. Unlike the shuffled and randomly drawn resource deck, at the beginning of each round, each player chooses a new plot card to be revealed, which will have an effect on the round to be played, allowing for a strategic element to an otherwise random game.\n\nPlot cards indicate the base amount of gold available for the player to use to bring new cards into play during his ''Marshalling'' phase (indicated by a number within a gold coin), a base initiative value to determine the order of play for the round (indicated by a number within a diamond), a base claim value to determine the scope of the effect that player winning a challenge (indicated by a number in a silver disk), and a text box detailing any other effects or restrictions on the plot card, including any ''traits'' that it might have.\n\nMost plot cards are designed with built-in trade-offs, sacrificing high claim for low income, or some other game mechanic drawback.\n\n===Character cards===\nCharacter cards represent the unique characters from the ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' novels, such as Eddard Stark, as well as generic individuals and massed groupings (such as armies) that can be found there. Generally, characters are the main focus of a deck as they are the principle card type used to participate in challenges, and thus collect the power tokens necessary to win.\n\nAttributes of a Character card consist of a gold cost (generally represented by a number overlaid on a gold coin in the upper left corner), a name across the top that may be preceded by a black flag if the character is unique and/or an infinity symbol if the character is ''endless'', a House affiliation (represented by one or more House shields in the upper right corner, although neutral characters will have a blank shield), artwork depicting the character in the top half of the card, a strength value (represented by a number on a stylized tapestry or a nondescript shield in the middle of the left side), zero to three challenge icons (a red axe represents Military, a green eye represents Intrigue, and a blue crown represents Power) arrayed in the bottom half of the left side, and a text box in the lower half of the card.\n\nWithin the textbox may be ''traits'', ''keywords'', other game effects or icons, and flavour text from the novels. Traits are bold and italicized words at the top of the textbox, and usually represent roles or groups within the world of ''A Song of Ice and Fire'', such as Lords or [[Dothraki language|Dothraki]]. They have no game function themselves, but instead are used to group characters together in order for other game effects to be used by or against varied groups of characters. Keywords are game mechanics defined in the rules that affect that character, such as No Attachments, which prevents any attachments from being placed on that character.\n\n===Attachment cards===\nAttachments are cards that are used exclusively to modify other cards. An attachment may not be in play unless it is attached to the proper type of card, typically a character card unless the attachment itself says otherwise.\n\nAttributes of an Attachment card consist of a gold cost (generally represented by a number overlaid on a gold coin in the upper left corner), a name across the top that may be proceeded by a black flag if the attachment is unique and/or an infinity symbol if the attachment is ''endless'', a House affiliation (represented by one or more House shields in the upper right corner, although neutral attachments will have no shield), artwork depicting the attachment in the top half of the card, and a text box in the lower half of the card. Throughout the Winter block, some cards were printed with a black crow icon in the bottom left corner to indicate the attachment is ''Doomed''. It is unknown if such attachments will appear again.\n\nWithin the textbox may be ''traits'', ''keywords'', other game effects or icons, and flavour text from the novels. Traits are bold and italicized words at the top of the textbox, and usually represent types of enhancements, such as skills or titles. They have no game function themselves, but instead are used to group attachments together in order for other game effects to be used by or against varied groups of attachments. Keywords are game mechanics defined in the rules that affect that attachment such as Setup, which allows the attachment to be played at the beginning of the game unlike normal attachments.\n\nOccasionally, game effects can cause cards to become face-down attachments attached to specific other cards. These function the same as normal attachments, except they are treated as having no names, no text, no gold costs, no House affiliations, and are discarded if they are ever forced to leave play.\n\n===Location cards===\nLocation cards represent the unique places in the setting of the ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' novels, such as [[King's Landing (A Song of Ice and Fire)|King's Landing]], generic regions such as [[fiefdoms]], and even mobile locations such as sailing [[watercraft|vessels]] and [[warships]]. Many locations are used to supply additional ''income'', ''influence'', but a wide variety of effects are present.\n\nAttributes of a Location card consist of a gold cost (generally represented by a number overlaid on a gold coin in the upper left corner), a name across the top that may be preceded by a black flag if the location is unique, a House affiliation (represented by one or more House shields in the upper right corner, although neutral locations will have no shield), artwork depicting the location in the top half of the card, and a text box in the lower half of the card.\n\nWithin the textbox may be ''traits'', ''keywords'', other game effects or icons, and flavour text from the novels. Traits are bold and italicized words at the top of the textbox, and usually represent regions within the world of A Song of Ice and Fire, such as Westeros or Dorne. They have no game function themselves, but instead are used to group locations together in order for other game effects to be used by or against varied groups of locations. Keywords are game mechanics defined in the rules that affect that location, such as Limited which restricts the player to playing one such card per round.\n\n===Event cards===\nEvent cards represent special actions or happenings from the ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' novels that can be used in the course of the game. Certain events may be restricted so that they may only be played by a specific House, and some may only affect cards of a particular House affiliation. Event cards generally have a play restriction or a cost of some type which may be paid in influence, gold, or possibly by modifying the game state of one or more characters, locations, attachments or house card.\n\nAttributes of an Event card consist of a name across the top that may be preceded by a black flag if the event is unique and/or an infinity symbol if the event is ''endless'', artwork depicting the event in the top half of the card, and a text box in the lower half of the card.\n\nWithin the textbox may be ''traits'', ''keywords'', but primarily will be one or more game effects, and flavour text from the novels. Traits are bold and italicized words at the top of the textbox, and usually represent specific types of events such as ''Small Council''. They have no game function themselves, but instead are used to group events together in order for other game effects to be used by or against varied groups of events. Keywords are game mechanics defined in the rules that affect that event, such as Deathbound directing a used event to the dead pile instead of the normal discard pile.\n\n==Rules==\n\n===Deck building===\nEach player participating in an A Game of Thrones game uses two decks: 1) a 7 card ''plot'' deck and 2) a 60+ (40+ for draft) card ''draw'' deck of ''characters'', ''attachments'', ''locations'', and ''events''. During play the ''draw'' deck cards will often end up in other game play areas including the ''discard pile'' (cards discarded from play) and the ''dead pile'' (cards that were killed or are marked with the Deathbound keyword). Typically, players are only allowed three copies of any particular card (as determined by the card name, regardless of card type or game text similarity) in their ''draw'' deck, and only one copy of any particular card, by name, in their ''plot'' deck, but these restrictions can be modified by some other cards, such as the Twins agenda.\n\n===Winning conditions===\nA player must earn 15 power tokens between their House card and characters in play to win A Game of Thrones. Numerous cards in the game can change the amount a player or his opponent are required to earn in order to win. Generally, power tokens are earned by winning challenges against an opponent, but some cards allow a player to directly claim power for his House card or characters in other ways.\n\n===Setup===\nAt the beginning of the game, each player shuffles their ''draw'' deck, and draws the top 7 cards, with an option for a ''[[mulligan (games)|mulligan]]'' given to each player to shuffle and draw a new hand. From this initial hand, each player is able to select up to 5 gold worth of characters, locations, and attachments with the Setup keyword, but no more than 1 card of any type with the Limited keyword, from their hand; these cards are placed face-down until all players are ready to reveal their initial cards in play. Once all cards are revealed, players draw cards again until they each have 7 cards in their hand again.\n\n===Rounds and phases===\nThe game is played through repeated rounds until one or more players meets the winning condition, or all but one player has met the elimination condition. Rounds are divided into 7 phases, with each phase allowing players to alternate actions that affect the game state in some way.\n\nThe first phase every round is the ''Plot'' phase. Each player selects one unused plot from his ''plot'' deck, and all players reveal their chosen plots simultaneously. Initiative values from plot cards and other resources are tallied, and the player with the highest initiative chooses which player will go first in each phase of the current round. The textbox effects of plots are then resolved in the order chosen by the first player.\n\nIn the second phase, the ''Draw'' phase, each player is allowed to draw two cards from their ''draw'' deck.\n\nAlthough divided into turns for each player, the ''Marshalling'' phase is a single phase for all players. At the beginning of each player's turn in the Marshalling phase, the player counts all income from plot card and any other resources available. The player is then able to bring new resources in the form of characters, locations, and attachments into play by spending the gold. Some events and other triggered effects also require the payment of gold, and unused income is not carried over into other rounds, so resource management is important.\n\nThe fourth phase is the ''Challenge'' phase. As with the ''Marshalling'' phase, each player has a turn to initiate challenges against other players. Generally, players may initiate one each of ''Military'', ''Intrigue'', and ''Power'' challenges each round, but several cards can allow exta challenges to be initiated or deny certain challenges at all. Also, in a multiplayer game, he can either use all his challenges on one opponent or divide them among his adversaries. He doesn't have to use all of them. Challenges can be initiated in any order, and require a player to ''kneel'' one or more characters with an icon matching the challenge type to begin the challenge. Then, the player being attacked may kneel one or more characters to attempt to oppose the challenge. Once all player actions are taken, the player with the highest total strength in the challenge wins. If the defending player wins, nothing special occurs, but if the attacker wins, then the defender suffers losses depending on the type of challenge initiated.\n* Military - if the defending player loses, he must ''kill'' a number of characters he controls equal to the claim value on the attacker's plot.\n* Intrigue - if the defending player loses, he must randomly discard a number of cards from hand equal to the claim value on the attacker's plot.\n* Power - if the defending player loses, he must remove a number of power tokens from his House card equal to the claim value on the attacker's plot, and place them on the attacker's House card.\n\nIn the fifth phase, the ''Dominance'' phase, each player counts the total strength of all controlled characters that are still ''standing'', plus the amount of gold still remaining in his possession (unspent). The player with the highest total wins dominance that round, and claims 1 power token for his House, taken from the power common pool.\n\nIn the ''Standing'' phase each player changes each ''kneeling'' card to ''standing''.\n\nWith the LCG format came a new phase, the ''Taxation'' phase, in which each player returns unspent gold to the common pool (in the CCG format, players could not use gold outside of their turn in the Marshalling phase).\n\n===Common game terms and rules===\n''Kneeling'' and ''standing'' are the two possible game states for each card in the game, although there is a special ''moribund'' state that's further explained in the faq on FFG website. ''Standing'' cards are upright, and are ready for use to pay for effects, or to initiate or defend challenges. ''Kneeling'' cards are rotated 90 degrees to the side, to indicate that they've been used to pay for an effect, or to initiate or defend a challenge. Some game effects are able to ''kneel'' cards (changing them from ''standing'' to ''kneeling'') or ''stand'' cards (changing them from ''kneeling'' to ''standing'') in order to manipulate the resources a player has available.\n\n''Unique'' cards represent the special individuals, places, items, and happenings in the world of A Song of Ice and Fire. Unique cards may not be played if the player already has a copy of that card in play, or if a copy of that card can be found in the player's dead pile. Unique characters, locations, and attachments may be placed with copies that are already in play to serve as ''duplicates''. Duplicates may be discarded to save the unique card from being killed or discard.\n\n''Triggered Effects'' are a type of game effect that a player chooses to use in order to change the game state in some way. Triggered effects are indicated by a bold name of a phase (one of ''Plot'', ''Draw'', ''Marshalling'', ''Challenges'', ''Dominance'', or ''Standing'') or ''Any phase'' to indicate when the effect may be used. Another timing word that may precede a triggered effect is a bold ''Response'', which indicates that the effect may only be used in response to another occurrence in the game. ''Triggered abilities'' are a subset of triggered effects, and are specifically triggered effects that are written on cards currently in play.\n\n''Passive Effects'' are game effects that have no bold timing restriction indicated, but instead happen whenever certain prerequisites are met, such as a character coming into play.\n\n''Constant Abilities'' are game effects written on cards in play that have an ongoing effect on the game state.\n\n''Influence'' is indicated on various characters, locations, and attachments in the game by a number on a scroll in the textbox of the card. In the Valyrian block, influence was introduced as an additional resource to manage, requiring players to kneel one or more cards with a specific total amount of influence to pay for an effect.\n\nNormally, once a game effect has been initiated, it fully resolves without an interruption. However, once an effect is begun, there is a chance for specific effects to ''Cancel'' the initial effect. If the effect is cancelled, all costs stay paid, use limitations remain, but the effects do not occur.\n\n''Kill'' means removing a character from play, and placing that character in the ''dead pile''. Kill effects only work on characters, including other cards that are currently functioning as characters, but other cards can be placed in the dead pile through various game effects, such as the Deathbound keyword.\n\n''Discard'', when occurring without the modifier ''from hand'', means to take a card that is in play, and place it in the ''discard pile''.\n\nGenerally, whenever an effect targets a card to be killed or discarded, players are given a chance to ''Save'' the card from the effect, either by discarding a duplicate of the targeted card or by using another game effect. If a card is saved, it is not removed from play, and it is not considered killed or discarded.\n\n==Organized play==\n\n===Night's Watch===\n[[Fantasy Flight Games]] has an official group of volunteers that organize sanctioned tournaments for A Game of Thrones. The [[Night's Watch]] are named after the guardians of The Wall in northern Westeros in the fictional setting of ''A Song of Ice and Fire''. These volunteers organize tournaments, arrange demonstration games for new and interested players, and hand out promotional materials provided by FFG.\n\n===Prizes===\n* '''Gold dragons''' are a form of loyalty points that were awarded for purchases and playing in tournaments. The packaging for [[booster packs]], [[starter pack|starter decks]], and premium starter decks all have an image of a gold coin with a number representing the number of gold dragons earned, being one, two, and five respectively. Players could also earn certificates of eighty, forty, and twenty gold dragons for placing first, second, or third (respectively) in a sanctioned tournament. Gold dragons were redeemable to FFG for older promotional cards, booster packs, and other specialized AGoT products, such as card binders, stone house cards, and house-specific power tokens.  The Gold Dragon redemption program officially ended on June 30, 2008.\n* '''Promotional cards''' were frequently provided to Night's Watch volunteers by FFG to be given to participants of sanctioned tournaments. Sometimes these cards follow a special theme for the tournament, but that is not always the case. Usually the cards can legally be included in any deck, but some are marked with a skull icon to indicate they cannot be included unless special rules are in effect for that tournament.\n\n===Tournaments===\nThere are several different official tournament types sanctioned by FFG. In the ''Classic'' format, players bring their own decks, which may include cards from any set, as long as the card is not on the banned list. In ''Standard'' format, players bring their own decks, which may only include cards from the most recent blocks. {{As of|2006|alt=As of August 2006}}, only cards released since Valyrian block are legal in Standard format. In ''Limited'' format, players instead build their decks at the tournament, using provided draft packs (in ''Limited - Draft'') or starter decks (in ''Limited - Sealed Deck'') and booster packs.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.agameofthrones.com/faq.php| title = A Game of Thrones FAQ| accessdate = 2007-07-16 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070627223429/http://www.agameofthrones.com/faq.php |archivedate = 2007-06-27}}</ref>\n\nAside from the restrictions on usable card pool, FFG places no limits on how Night's Watch volunteers organize the tournaments.\n\n[http://www.thrones-tournaments.com Thrones-Tournaments.com] tries to provide a central list of all international and local store tournaments, to help gamers find play to compete in.\n\n===World and Continental Championships===\nThe A Game of Thrones World Championships were held yearly at [[Gen Con]] Indy until 2012, when they moved to Fantasy Flight's Event Centre in [[Minneapolis]], with Gencon being redesignated North American Championships.

He now has a consulting role at FFG.  The runner up in that tournament, Nate French, came on as lead developer in Spring of 2006 and continues to this day.\n\n==Podcasts==\n\nThere are a number of podcasts focused on the ''A Game of Thrones: The Living Card Game'', such as the weekly [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/podcasts/_/game-of-thrones-beyond-the-wall/?sort_col=record_saved&sort_order=desc&per_page=25 Beyond The Wall], [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/podcasts/_/game-of-thrones-podcasts/ 2 Champs and a Chump], [https://soundcloud.com/great-beards-of-westeros Great Beards of Westeros] and the Spanish language [https://soundcloud.com/2maestros1pupilo/ 2 Maestros 1 Pupilo].\n\n==Sets and expansions==\nWhen it was released, A Game of Thrones was introduced as a CCG. The cards for the AGoT CCG were organized into numerous sets and expansions that could be mixed together and used interchangeably. A ''block'' consisted of a ''base set'', up to two ''expansion sets'', a ''premium starter'', and often one or more promotional cards.\n\nTypically, a base set consisted of 240 cards available in either [[starter pack|starter decks]], consisting of a mix of fixed cards and a random assortment of other cards, or [[booster packs]], consisting of 11 randomly sorted cards, of which 1 is rare, 3 are uncommon, and 7 are common. Booster packs were generally shipped in groups of 36, creating booster boxes. Expansion sets typically contained 150 cards, and were only distributed as booster packs similar to those of a base set. Premium Starters consisted of two or three pre-built decks of fixed cards, typically reprints from earlier sets, but also introducing 10 new cards as well.\n\nWithin a base set and expansion set, the cards were divided into groups based on their frequency of appearance, with rare cards being included the least frequent, uncommon cards slightly more frequent, and common cards being the most frequent. Also available in regular and premium starters were a specific number of fixed cards that always appeared in that packaging. Also available were ''draft packs'' which consisted of 1 ''draft'' card, 5 ''plot'' cards, 6 ''house'' cards and 8 ''locations'' that are generally useful to any deck, and allow for a more level competitive field during ''draft'' tournaments.\n\nIn late 2007, the A Game of Thrones CCG was converted to the A Game of Thrones LCG (Living Card Game), which ended the random booster packs in favor of fixed packs, called Chapter Packs, released on a roughly monthly basis. Chapter packs consist of 60 fixed cards - 3 copies of 20 cards. The Core Set consists of 4 preconstructed decks consisting of Stark, Lannister, Baratheon, and Targaryen, and is marketed as a starting point for a new player. It will also include a game board, power tokens, gold tokens, as well as game pieces to use for the multiplayer titles.  Along with the switch to the LCG, there has also been more of a focus on the multiplayer aspect of the game, now referred to as Melee, rather than the head to head play, now referred to as Joust.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ '''A Game of Thrones CCG card sets'''\n!
