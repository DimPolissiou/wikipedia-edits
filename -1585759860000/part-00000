Specifically, there was a delayed response to the flooding of [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]]. (See [[Hurricane preparedness for New Orleans]] for criticism of the failure of Federal flood protection.)\n\nWithin days of Katrina's August 29, 2005 landfall, public debate arose about the local, state and federal governments' role in the [[Preparations for Hurricane Katrina|preparations]] for and response to the storm. Criticism was prompted largely by televised images of visibly shaken and frustrated political leaders, and of residents who remained in New Orleans without water, food or [[Emergency shelter|shelter]] and the deaths of several citizens by thirst, exhaustion, and violence, days after the storm itself had passed.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} The treatment of people who had evacuated to registered facilities such as the [[Louisiana Superdome|Superdome]] was also criticized.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\nCriticism from politicians, activists, pundits, and journalists of all stripes has been directed at the local, state and federal governments.\n\nNew Orleans Mayor [[Ray Nagin]] was also criticized for failing to implement his flood plan and for ordering residents to a shelter of last resort without any provisions for food, water, security, or sanitary conditions. Perhaps the most important criticism of Nagin is that he delayed his [[emergency evacuation]] order until less than a day before landfall, which led to hundreds of deaths of people who (by that time) could not find any way out of the city.<ref name=\"finalbipartisonreport\">\"{{cite web |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-109hrpt377/pdf/CRPT-109hrpt377.pdf |title=A Failure of Initiative: Final Report of the Select Bipartisan Committee to Investigate the Preparation for and Response to Hurricane Katrina |author=Select Bipartisan Committee to Investigate the Preparation for and Response to Hurricane Katrina |publisher=U.S. Government Publishing Office |date=February 15, 2006 |accessdate=July 30, 2015  }}</ref> Adding to the criticism was the broadcast of [[school bus]] parking lots full of baby blue school buses, which Mayor Nagin refused to be used in evacuation. When asked why the buses were not used to assist evacuations instead of holing up in the Superdome, Nagin cited the lack of insurance liability and shortage of bus drivers.<ref name=\"frontline\">[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/storm/view/ Frontline: The Storm]</ref>\n\nNew Orleans has been classified as a non-regime city. Regimes involve governmental and non-governmental cooperation, a specific agenda, a recognized problem and resources to deal with the problem.

Specifically, there was a delayed response to the flooding of [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]]. (See [[Hurricane preparedness for New Orleans]] for criticism of the failure of Federal flood protection.)\n\nWithin days of Katrina's August 29, 2005 landfall, public debate arose about the local, state and federal governments' role in the [[Preparations for Hurricane Katrina|preparations]] for and response to the storm. Criticism was prompted largely by televised images of visibly shaken and frustrated political leaders, and of residents who remained in New Orleans without water, food or [[Emergency shelter|shelter]] and the deaths of several citizens by thirst, exhaustion, and violence, days after the storm itself had passed.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} The treatment of people who had evacuated to registered facilities such as the [[Louisiana Superdome|Superdome]] was also criticized.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\nCriticism from politicians, activists, pundits, and journalists of all stripes has been directed at the local, state and federal governments.\n\nNew Orleans Mayor [[Ray Nagin]] was also criticized for failing to implement his flood plan and for ordering residents to a shelter of last resort without any provisions for food, water, security, or sanitary conditions. Perhaps the most important criticism of Nagin is that he delayed his [[emergency evacuation]] order until less than a day before landfall, which led to hundreds of deaths of people who (by that time) could not find any way out of the city.<ref name=\"finalbipartisonreport\">\"{{cite web |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-109hrpt377/pdf/CRPT-109hrpt377.pdf |title=A Failure of Initiative: Final Report of the Select Bipartisan Committee to Investigate the Preparation for and Response to Hurricane Katrina |author=Select Bipartisan Committee to Investigate the Preparation for and Response to Hurricane Katrina |publisher=U.S. Government Publishing Office |date=February 15, 2006 |accessdate=July 30, 2015  }}</ref> Adding to the criticism was the broadcast of [[school bus]] parking lots full of baby blue school buses, which Mayor Nagin refused to be used in evacuation.

Regimes involve governmental and non-governmental cooperation, a specific agenda, a recognized problem and resources to deal with the problem. New Orleans only had a temporary coalition to deal with Hurricane Katrina, which led to ineffective, temporary and inefficient evacuation and provision of resources. Organizations such as the Red Cross attempted to form coalitions, but the various actors could not agree on a specific solution, and this failure to cooperate led to instability and misunderstanding between governmental and non-governmental actors.<ref>Burns, P.; Thomas, M.. \"The Failure of the Nonregime: How Katrina exposed New Orleans as a Regimeless City\".

Despite these factors preventing many people from being able to evacuate on their own, the mandatory evacuation called on August 27 made no provisions to evacuate homeless, low-income, or sick individuals, nor the city's elderly or infirm residents. Consequently, most of those stranded in the city were the poor, the elderly, and the sick.\n\nIt has been stated in the evacuation order that, beginning at noon on August 28 and running for several hours, all city buses were redeployed to shuttle local residents to, \"refuges of last resort,\" designated in advance, including the [[Louisiana Superdome]].<ref name=\"NOdanger\">Davis, Matthew. \"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4331330.stm Fema 'knew of New Orleans danger'].\" ''[[BBC News]].''

Brown]] was greatly surprised by the much larger numbers of people who turned up seeking refuge and that the first wave of supplies were quickly depleted.<ref name=\"NOdanger\"/> The large number of deaths were a result of the insufficient response and evacuation before Katrina's arrival, primarily due to city and state resistance to issuing an evacuation order and risking \"crying wolf\" and losing face should the hurricane have left the path of model prediction. Had [[Contraflow lane reversal|contra-flow]] on highways been initiated sooner and more buses begun evacuating families (including the idle school buses that were not used at all) the numbers of stranded New Orleans occupants would have been significantly less, making the initial wave of FEMA supplies adequate and even excessive.\n\n== Federal government response to the state of emergency ==\nPresident Bush signed a [[United States Dollar|$]]10.5&nbsp;billion relief package within four days of the hurricane,<ref>\"[http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/09/02/katrina.congress/index.html Bush signs $10.5 billion disaster aid bill].\" ''[[CNN]].''

Many of the poor depend on [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]], [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], or other public assistance checks, which they receive on the first of each month, meaning that Hurricane Katrina made landfall just when many of the poor had exhausted their resources. Thus, many of the city's poor simply couldn't afford to flee the city before the hurricane struck.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference from a relief center in [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]], [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Laura Bush]] explained that the poor are always the main victims of natural disasters. \"This is what happens when there's a natural disaster of this scope,\" Mrs. Bush said. \"The poorer people are usually in the neighborhoods that are the lowest or the most exposed or the most vulnerable.
