Some of the more memorable events the morning show perpetrated were the \"Heterosexual Pride Parade\", a wrestling match between Ron and the \"Punisher\" against Allen and Hymie, which raised money for the MDA, Hymie taking the morn show and some listeners skydiving, Allen and Hymie driving a top fuel dragster at Bonneville Raceway, and a hoax which had listeners believing that Allen Handy had been arrested by the Secret Service.  The show was every bit as wild as anything being done at the time in the largest markets, including Howard Stern in New York City.

In 1998 the station reverted to the more familiar \"KBER 101\" slogan of its earlier years and is currently a top rated mainstream rock station in Salt Lake City Utah.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.radio-info.com/site/markets/grid/salt-lake-city |title=Radio-Info Market Data |access-date=2010-04-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415191311/http://www.radio-info.com/site/markets/grid/salt-lake-city |archive-date=2010-04-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref> By [[2008 in radio|2008]], the station's sister station [[KENZ (FM)|KHTB]] became a [[modern rock]] station, carrying mostly newer rock.

Grandson of emperor [[Charlemagne]] and the third son of [[Louis the Pious]], emperor of [[Francia]], and his first wife, [[Ermengarde of Hesbaye]],{{sfn|Riche|1993|p=145}} he received the appellation ''Germanicus'' shortly after his death in recognition of Magna [[Germania]] of the Roman Empire, reflecting the Carolingians' assertions that they were the rightful descendants of the [[Roman Empire]].  \n[[File:East Francia 843.svg|thumb|right|Kingdom of East Francia]]\n\nAfter protracted clashes with his father and his brothers, Louis received the East Frankish Empire in the 843 [[Treaty of Verdun]]. His attempts to conquer the West Frankish Empire of his half-brother [[Charles the Bald]] in 858\u201359 were unsuccessful. The 860s were marked by a severe crisis, with the East Frankish rebellions of the sons, as well as struggles to maintain supremacy over his realm. In the [[Treaty of Meerssen]] he acquired Lotharingia for the East Frankish Empire in 870. On the other hand, he tried and failed to claim both the title of Emperor and Italy. In the East, Louis was able to reach a longer-term peace agreement in 874 after decades of conflict with the Moravians. Due to a decline in the written form in administration and government, Louis' reign predates Ottonian times.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Prudentius |title=Annals of St. Bertin |date=861}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nHis early years were partly spent at the court of his grandfather, [[Charlemagne]], whose special affection he is said to have won. When the emperor Louis the Pious divided his dominions between his sons in 817, Louis was made the ruler of [[Duchy of Bavaria]], following the practice of emperor Charlemagne of bestowing a local kingdom to a close family member who then would serve as his lieutenant and local governor.{{sfn|Riche|1993|p=147}} Louis ruled from [[Regensburg]], the old capital of the [[Bavarians#History|Bavarii]]. In 825 he became involved in wars with the [[Wends]] and [[Sorbs]] on his eastern frontier. In 827 he married [[Hemma]], sister of his stepmother [[Judith of Bavaria (died 843)|Judith of Bavaria]], both daughters of [[Welf (father of Judith)|Welf]], whose possessions ranged from [[Alsace]] to Bavaria.\n\nIt was not until 826 that Louis first came to rule Bavaria.{{clarify}} In 828 and 829 he undertook two campaigns against the Bulgarians who wanted to penetrate into Pannonia without great success. During his time as Unterk\u00f6nig, he tried to extend his rule to the Rhine-Main area.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Deutinger |first1=Roman |title=Hludovicus rex Baioariae. Zur Rolle Bayerns in der Politik Ludwigs des Deutschen |location=Darmstadt |pages=47\u201366}}</ref>\n\n==Rebellious son==\nHis involvement in the first civil war against his father's reign was limited, but in the second his elder brothers, [[Lothair I]], then [[King of Italy]], and [[Pepin I of Aquitaine|Pepin I]], [[Duke of Aquitaine]], persuaded him to invade [[Alamannia]] which their father had given to their young half-brother [[Charles the Bald]], by promising to give him the land in the new partition they would make after a victory. In 832 he led an army of [[Slavs]] into [[Alamannia]], but was driven back by his father.{{sfn|Riche|1993|p=154}} Louis the Pious disinherited him, but to no effect; the emperor was soon captured by his own rebellious sons and deposed. Upon his swift reinstatement, however, the emperor Louis made peace with his son Louis and legally restored Bavaria (never actually lost) to him in 836.\n\nLouis was the instigator of the third civil war, which began in 839. A strip of his land having been given to the young half-brother Charles, Louis invaded Alamannia again. This time emperor Louis responded quickly, and soon the younger Louis was forced into the far southeastern corner of his realm, the [[March of Pannonia]]. Peace was then made by force of arms.\n\n==Civil war and aftermath, 840\u2013844==\nWhen the emperor Louis died in 840, and [[Lothair I]] claimed the whole Empire, Louis allied with [[Charles the Bald]], and defeated Lothair I and their nephew [[Pepin II of Aquitaine]], son of [[Pepin I of Aquitaine]], at the [[Battle of Fontenoy (841)|Battle of Fontenoy]] in June 841.{{sfn|Riche|1993|p=161\u2013162}}\n\nIn June 842 the three brothers met on an island in the river [[Sa\u00f4ne]] to negotiate a peace and each appointed forty representatives to arrange the boundaries of their respective kingdoms. This developed into the [[Treaty of Verdun]], concluded in August 843, by which Louis received the bulk of the lands lying east of the [[Rhine]] ([[East Francia]]), together with a district around [[Speyer]], [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], and [[Mainz]], on the left bank of the river (see also [[Oaths of Strasbourg]] 842). His territories included Bavaria (where he made [[Regensburg]] the centre of his government), [[Thuringia]], [[Franconia]], and [[Saxony]].\n\nLouis may be called the founder of the [[German kingdom]], though his attempts to maintain the unity of the Empire proved futile. Having in 842 crushed the ''[[Stellinga]]'' rising in Saxony,{{sfn|Goldberg|2006|p=112}} in 844 he compelled the [[Obotrites]]{{sfn|Gwatkin|Whitney|Tanner|Previt\u00e9-Orton|Brooke|1957|p=31}} to accept his authority and put their prince, Gozzmovil, to death. [[Thachulf, Duke of Thuringia]], then undertook campaigns against the [[Bohemia]]ns, [[Great Moravia|Moravians]], and other tribes, but was not very successful in resisting the ravaging [[Vikings]].\n\n==Treaty of Verdun==\n{{Main Article|Treaty of Verdun}}\n\n[[File:Treaty of Verdun 843.png|thumb|Lands divided by the Treaty of Verdun]]\n\nAfter the death of Emperor Louis the Pious, Lothar laid claim to all the imperial rights established in the Ordinatio of 817. As a result, Louis the German and Charles the Bald forged an alliance. Lothar I offered his nephew Pippin II, the son of 838 deceased Pippin I., an alliance. At the Battle of Fontenoy, Louis the German and Charles the Bald fought successfully against Lothar I and Pippin II in June 841. Both sides suffered heavy casualties. According to [[Annales Fuldenses|the Annals of Fulda]], it was the biggest bloodbath the Franks had experienced since time immemorial.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Goldberg |first1=Eric Joseph |title=Popular revolt, dynastic politics, and aristocratic factionalism in the early Middle Ages.

Encouraged by his nephews [[Pepin_II_of_Aquitaine|Peppin II]] and [[Charles of Provence]], Louis invaded in West Francia in 858. Charles the Bald could not even raise an army to resist the invasion and fled to [[Burgundy]]. Later that year Louis issued a charter dated \"the first year of the reign in West Francia.\" However, treachery and desertion in his army, and the continued loyalty of the Aquitanian bishops to Charles the Bald, brought about the failure of the whole enterprise. As such on 7 June 860 at [[Koblenz]], both Louis and Charles made public vows to uphold the peace.{{sfn|Riche|1993|p=174}}\n\nAfter the emperor [[Lothair I]] died in 855, Louis and Charles for a time cooperated in plans to divide Lothair's possessions among themselves, the only impediments to this being Lothair's sons and heirs \u2013 [[Lothair II]] (who received [[Lotharingia]]), [[Louis II of Italy]] (who held the imperial title and the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]]) and [[Charles of Provence]]. In 868 at [[Metz]] Louis and Charles agreed to partition [[Lotharingia]]. When Lothair II died in 869, Louis was lying seriously ill, and his armies were engaged in a war with the Moravians. Charles the Bald quickly seized Lothair's lands; but Louis, having recovered, compelled him by a threat of war to agree to the [[Treaty of Meerssen]], which divided Lothair's lands between all the claimants.{{sfn|Riche|1993|p=199}}\n\n==''Divisio regni'' among the sons==\n[[File:Torhalle Kloster Lorsch.jpg|thumb|Carolingian gatehouse (''Torhalle'') to [[Lorsch Abbey]], where Louis the German was buried]]\nThe later years of Louis the German were troubled by rebellions of his sons. The eldest, [[Carloman of Bavaria]], revolted in 861 and again two years later. This was followed by the second son [[Louis the Younger]], who was joined by his brother [[Charles the Fat]]. In 864 Louis was forced to grant Carloman the kingdom of Bavaria, which he himself had once held under his father. In 865 he divided the remainder of his lands \u2013 [[Saxony]] with [[Franconia]] and [[Thuringia]] went to Louis the Younger and [[Swabia]] with [[Raetia]] to Charles the Fat.\n\nA report that the emperor [[Louis II of Italy]] had died led to a peace between father and sons and attempts by Louis the German to gain the imperial crown for his oldest son Carloman. These efforts were thwarted by Louis II of Italy who was in fact not dead, and Louis' old adversary, Charles the Bald.\n\nLouis was preparing for a new war when he died on August 28, 876 in [[Frankfurt]]. He was buried at the [[abbey]] of [[Lorsch]], leaving three sons and three daughters. His sons, unusual for their earlier behaviour, respected the divisions made a decade earlier and each contented himself with his own kingdom.\n\n==Later Life==\n\n[[File:GrabplatteLudwig_Ludwig_III_Kunigunde.JPG|thumb|Commemorative plaque for Louis III]]\n\nIn the years 872 and 873, ambassadors of the Eastern Roman Emperor Basil I came to Louis in Regensburg and showed that his rule was perceived as far as Constantinople.

Grandson of emperor [[Charlemagne]] and the third son of [[Louis the Pious]], emperor of [[Francia]], and his first wife, [[Ermengarde of Hesbaye]],{{sfn|Riche|1993|p=145}} he received the appellation ''Germanicus'' shortly after his death in recognition of Magna [[Germania]] of the Roman Empire, reflecting the Carolingians' assertions that they were the rightful descendants of the [[Roman Empire]].  \n[[File:East Francia 843.svg|thumb|right|Kingdom of East Francia]]\n\nAfter protracted clashes with his father and his brothers, Louis received the East Frankish Empire in the 843 [[Treaty of Verdun]]. His attempts to conquer the West Frankish Empire of his half-brother [[Charles the Bald]] in 858\u201359 were unsuccessful. The 860s were marked by a severe crisis, with the East Frankish rebellions of the sons, as well as struggles to maintain supremacy over his realm. In the [[Treaty of Meerssen]] he acquired Lotharingia for the East Frankish Empire in 870. On the other hand, he tried and failed to claim both the title of Emperor and Italy. In the East, Louis was able to reach a longer-term peace agreement in 874 after decades of conflict with the Moravians. Due to a decline in the written form in administration and government, Louis' reign predates Ottonian times.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Prudentius |title=Annals of St. Bertin |date=861}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nHis early years were partly spent at the court of his grandfather, [[Charlemagne]], whose special affection he is said to have won. When the emperor Louis the Pious divided his dominions between his sons in 817, Louis was made the ruler of [[Duchy of Bavaria]], following the practice of emperor Charlemagne of bestowing a local kingdom to a close family member who then would serve as his lieutenant and local governor.{{sfn|Riche|1993|p=147}} Louis ruled from [[Regensburg]], the old capital of the [[Bavarians#History|Bavarii]]. In 825 he became involved in wars with the [[Wends]] and [[Sorbs]] on his eastern frontier. In 827 he married [[Hemma]], sister of his stepmother [[Judith of Bavaria (died 843)|Judith of Bavaria]], both daughters of [[Welf (father of Judith)|Welf]], whose possessions ranged from [[Alsace]] to Bavaria.\n\nIt was not until 826 that Louis first came to rule Bavaria.{{clarify}} In 828 and 829 he undertook two campaigns against the Bulgarians who wanted to penetrate into Pannonia without great success. During his time as Unterk\u00f6nig, he tried to extend his rule to the Rhine-Main area.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Deutinger |first1=Roman |title=Hludovicus rex Baioariae. Zur Rolle Bayerns in der Politik Ludwigs des Deutschen |location=Darmstadt |pages=47\u201366}}</ref>\n\n==Rebellious son==\nHis involvement in the first civil war against his father's reign was limited, but in the second his elder brothers, [[Lothair I]], then [[King of Italy]], and [[Pepin I of Aquitaine|Pepin I]], [[Duke of Aquitaine]], persuaded him to invade [[Alamannia]] which their father had given to their young half-brother [[Charles the Bald]], by promising to give him the land in the new partition they would make after a victory. In 832 he led an army of [[Slavs]] into [[Alamannia]], but was driven back by his father.{{sfn|Riche|1993|p=154}} Louis the Pious disinherited him, but to no effect; the emperor was soon captured by his own rebellious sons and deposed. Upon his swift reinstatement, however, the emperor Louis made peace with his son Louis and legally restored Bavaria (never actually lost) to him in 836.\n\nLouis was the instigator of the third civil war, which began in 839. A strip of his land having been given to the young half-brother Charles, Louis invaded Alamannia again. This time emperor Louis responded quickly, and soon the younger Louis was forced into the far southeastern corner of his realm, the [[March of Pannonia]]. Peace was then made by force of arms.\n\n==Civil war, 840\u2013843==\nWhen the emperor Louis died in 840, and [[Lothair I]] claimed the whole Empire, Louis allied with [[Charles the Bald]], and defeated Lothair I and their nephew [[Pepin II of Aquitaine]], son of [[Pepin I of Aquitaine]], at the [[Battle of Fontenoy (841)|Battle of Fontenoy]] in June 841.{{sfn|Riche|1993|p=161\u2013162}}\n\nIn June 842 the three brothers met on an island in the river [[Sa\u00f4ne]] to negotiate a peace and each appointed forty representatives to arrange the boundaries of their respective kingdoms. This developed into the [[Treaty of Verdun]], concluded in August 843, by which Louis received the bulk of the lands lying east of the [[Rhine]] ([[East Francia]]), together with a district around [[Speyer]], [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], and [[Mainz]], on the left bank of the river (see also [[Oaths of Strasbourg]] 842). His territories included Bavaria (where he made [[Regensburg]] the centre of his government), [[Thuringia]], [[Franconia]], and [[Saxony]].\n\nLouis may be called the founder of the [[German kingdom]], though his attempts to maintain the unity of the Empire proved futile. Having in 842 crushed the ''[[Stellinga]]'' rising in Saxony,{{sfn|Goldberg|2006|p=112}} in 844 he compelled the [[Obotrites]]{{sfn|Gwatkin|Whitney|Tanner|Previt\u00e9-Orton|Brooke|1957|p=31}} to accept his authority and put their prince, Gozzmovil, to death. [[Thachulf, Duke of Thuringia]], then undertook campaigns against the [[Bohemia]]ns, [[Great Moravia|Moravians]], and other tribes, but was not very successful in resisting the ravaging [[Vikings]].\n\n==Treaty of Verdun==\n{{Main Article|Treaty of Verdun}}\n\n[[File:Treaty of Verdun 843.png|thumb|Lands divided by the Treaty of Verdun]]\n\nAfter the death of Emperor Louis the Pious, Lothar laid claim to all the imperial rights established in the Ordinatio of 817. As a result, Louis the German and Charles the Bald forged an alliance. Lothar I offered his nephew Pippin II, the son of 838 deceased Pippin I., an alliance. At the Battle of Fontenoy, Louis the German and Charles the Bald fought successfully against Lothar I and Pippin II in June 841. Both sides suffered heavy casualties. According to [[Annales Fuldenses|the Annals of Fulda]], it was the biggest bloodbath the Franks had experienced since time immemorial.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Goldberg |first1=Eric Joseph |title=Popular revolt, dynastic politics, and aristocratic factionalism in the early Middle Ages.

Encouraged by his nephews [[Pepin_II_of_Aquitaine|Peppin II]] and [[Charles of Provence]], Louis invaded in West Francia in 858. Charles the Bald could not even raise an army to resist the invasion and fled to [[Burgundy]]. Later that year Louis issued a charter dated \"the first year of the reign in West Francia.\" However, treachery and desertion in his army, and the continued loyalty of the Aquitanian bishops to Charles the Bald, brought about the failure of the whole enterprise. As such on 7 June 860 at [[Koblenz]], both Louis and Charles made public vows to uphold the peace.{{sfn|Riche|1993|p=174}}\n\nAfter the emperor [[Lothair I]] died in 855, Louis and Charles for a time cooperated in plans to divide Lothair's possessions among themselves, the only impediments to this being Lothair's sons and heirs \u2013 [[Lothair II]] (who received [[Lotharingia]]), [[Louis II of Italy]] (who held the imperial title and the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]]) and [[Charles of Provence]]. In 868 at [[Metz]] Louis and Charles agreed to partition [[Lotharingia]]. When Lothair II died in 869, Louis was lying seriously ill, and his armies were engaged in a war with the Moravians. Charles the Bald quickly seized Lothair's lands; but Louis, having recovered, compelled him by a threat of war to agree to the [[Treaty of Meerssen]], which divided Lothair's lands between all the claimants.{{sfn|Riche|1993|p=199}}\n\n==''Divisio regni'' among the sons==\n[[File:Torhalle Kloster Lorsch.jpg|thumb|Carolingian gatehouse (''Torhalle'') to [[Lorsch Abbey]], where Louis the German was buried]]\nThe later years of Louis the German were troubled by rebellions of his sons. The eldest, [[Carloman of Bavaria]], revolted in 861 and again two years later. This was followed by the second son [[Louis the Younger]], who was joined by his brother [[Charles the Fat]]. In 864 Louis was forced to grant Carloman the kingdom of Bavaria, which he himself had once held under his father. In 865 he divided the remainder of his lands \u2013 [[Saxony]] with [[Franconia]] and [[Thuringia]] went to Louis the Younger and [[Swabia]] with [[Raetia]] to Charles the Fat.\n\nA report that the emperor [[Louis II of Italy]] had died led to a peace between father and sons and attempts by Louis the German to gain the imperial crown for his oldest son Carloman. These efforts were thwarted by Louis II of Italy who was in fact not dead, and Louis' old adversary, Charles the Bald.\n\nLouis was preparing for a new war when he died on August 28, 876 in [[Frankfurt]]. He was buried at the [[abbey]] of [[Lorsch]], leaving three sons and three daughters. His sons, unusual for their earlier behaviour, respected the divisions made a decade earlier and each contented himself with his own kingdom.\n\n==Later Life==\n\n[[File:GrabplatteLudwig_Ludwig_III_Kunigunde.JPG|thumb|Commemorative plaque for Louis III]]\n\nIn the years 872 and 873, ambassadors of the Eastern Roman Emperor Basil I came to Louis in Regensburg and showed that his rule was perceived as far as Constantinople.

A joint NASA-Boeing investigation team \"found the two critical software defects were not detected ahead of flight despite multiple safeguards\", according to an agency statement. \"Ground intervention prevented the loss of the vehicle in both cases\". Before re-entry, engineers discovered another software error that affected the thruster firings needed to safely jettison the Starliner's service module. The service module software error \"incorrectly translated\" the jettison thruster firing sequence.

The museum was originally titled the \"Miami Youth Museum\" and was originally located in two shopping malls, the [[Bakery Center]] in South Miami, and then relocated to the [[Miracle Center]] in [[Coral Gables]].   \n\nThe {{convert|56500|sqft|m2|sing=on}} facility, designed by [[Arquitectonica]], includes 14 permanent galleries, pre-school classrooms, parent/teacher resource center, [[Kid Smart]] educational gift shop, 200-seat [[auditorium]] and [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]] restaurant.  The museum offers hundreds of bilingual, interactive exhibits; programs and classes and learning materials related to [[arts]], [[culture]], [[community]] and [[communication]].\n\n==Location==\nIn September 2003, after 12 years of planning, the Museum opened its new $25 million home on Watson Island near Downtown Miami. Over the past twenty years, they have relocated and expanded their space several times in response to public involvement. In the mid-1990s, planning was initiated among community leaders for the construction of its own stand-alone building.\n\nMiami Children\u2019s Museum was established in 1983 as the Miami Youth Museum. Our first home was a 2,000 square foot facility located in a shopping center in West Kendall. \n\nKey Events in the Museum's History\n1983 Miami Youth Museum was founded by forward thinking community leaders.\n\n1985 The 2,000 square-foot Miami Youth Museum opens in a mall on Sunset Drive. Visitorship is 9,301.\n\n1986 The Museum moves to a 4,000 square-foot facility in South Miami\u2019s Bakery Centre. Visitorship is 10,525.\n\n1987 Visitorship climbs to 18,871. The museum institutes its Community Outreach Program, which reaches 137,100 people.\n\n1988 The museum increases its exhibition space by 2,000 square feet and visitorship grows to 26,165. Community outreach is expanded.\n\n1990 The museum enlarges again, by 3,000 square feet and visitorship grows to 35,929. Community outreach serves 899,000 people.\n\n1991 The museum reaches visitor capacity of 47,686, where it remains for five years and the museum receives its first State of Florida Cultural Facilities grant.\n\n1992 The museum\u2019s board plans to build a new facility. A capital campaign is initiated with a $1 million lead gift.

However, Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay passed away <ref> Mysterious death of Pt Deendayal [https://www.timesnownews.com/the-buzz/article/unsolved-midnight-murder-mystery-of-deendayal-upadhyaya-at-mughalsarai-junction/236101 \"TimesNow\"]</ref> before he could translate his vision into reality. After the abrupt and unfortunate departure of Panditji, [[Rambhau Mhalgi]], a prominent political figure from Maharashtra, made it his responsibility to materialise his idea.\n\nThis is how a concept propounded by two thinkers and activists came into existence in the form of Rambhau Mhalgi Prabodhini (RMP). Initially launched as a memorial of Late Rambhau Mhalgi, in 1982 RMP widened its scope to be established as a unique Training and Research Academy, primarily aimed at enhancing the capabilities of voluntary activists and elected representatives of the people. Over the years it has blossomed into a multi-dimensional institute imparting training to elected representatives, activists, civil servants and journalists, and a centre for overall public-awakening activities and research projects. Additionally, the institute also provides training facilities, accommodation and recreation facilities to corporate houses.\n\n===Rambhau Mhalgi (1921\u20131981)===\n\n[[File:Rambhau Mhalgi.jpg|thumb|Rambhau Mhalgi]]\n\nRambhau Mhalgi Prabodhini (RMP) focuses on developing the human capital and management capabilities with the backdrop of age-old Indian values, gets its inspiration from Late Rambhau Mhalgi, former Member of Indian Parliament and an outstanding representative of the people. As we know, the success of democracy depends on the dedication and efficiency of elected representatives.\n\nRamchandra Mhalgi (later called Rambhau) was born on 9 July 1921 in a well established agricultural family from Pune district in Maharashtra. The fourth child of Kashinathpant and Sarasvatibai, Ramchandra lost his mother at the age of 11. After passing the vernacular final exam in school, he joined the Sarasvati Mandir School in Pune and passed three grades in a single academic year, cleared the matriculation exam with first division in 1939. Ramchandra's contact with Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) dates back to his school days. After matriculation, instead of staying back for further studies, he went to Kerala, as \u2018Rambhau\u2019 an RSS pracharak (full-time social worker). Later, he returned to Pune for graduation but responding to the wish of the second RSS Chief (Sarsanghchalak) \u2013 Golwalkar Guruji, he joined RSS.\n\nWhen RSS <ref> Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, [http://rss.org/ \"RSS\"]</ref>  was banned in 1948, Rambhau went underground and continued the movement against injustice. After the ban was lifted, he went back to Pune, where he bagged both the degrees of LLB and MA and cleared the bar council exam. He was entrusted with the responsibility of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), the student wing of RSS and later that of Jan Sangh (the then political wing of RSS) and took up the responsibility as executive officer of the party in Maharashtra. With his leadership, creativity and practicality, he set up various fronts, trying to reach out to people from different walks of life. He helped create awareness about the merger of Jammu and Kashmir with India. While the party kept growing, he married a teacher \u2013 Manu Ghanekar. He balanced his personal, professional and political lives.\n\n==Vision&Mission==\n\n[[File:Rambhau Mhalgi Prabodhini logo.png|thumb|Rambhau Mhalgi Prabodhini logo]]\n\nRambhau Mhalgi Prabodhini\u2019s vision is to contribute to the efforts for evolving a democracy that delivers through multifarious activities aimed at empowering activists through capacity building, enlightening the citizenry through public education and creating an informed public opinion through objectively conducted research.\n\n*To work for building the capacities of the elected representatives, political party activists, and voluntary social workers while understanding the overall human resource development needs of these sectors.\n*To impart capacity building training with a view to empowering the functionaries belonging to democratic polity, voluntary activism, and institution building; work in a result-oriented manner, with a professional approach and without diluting the commitment to eternal human principles.\n*To offer training aimed at knowledge enrichment, skill development and sustaining the purity of purpose.\n*To offer the citizenry an academy where leadership traits could be honed in a scientific way enabling the society at large overcome the all pervading crisis of leadership.\n\n==Training&Capacity Building==\n\n[[File:Training of Parliamentarians at RMP.jpg|thumb|400px|Training of Parliamentarians at RMP]]\n\nLeadership usually rises from the grassroots. And it is Grass roots that it must strive to address. RMP awakens this sense of responsibility in those who rise from this grim.\n\nThe nation does not want able activists who have the potential to lead her. Tens of thousands of well-meaning individuals struggle in the dust laden streets for the rights of their societies; strive to bring change for betterment. The need is to channelize and guide this bridled force for development of the nation.\n\nRMP seeks to be the enabler that elevates these promising individuals to become leaders. We are proud to have developed and established the very concept of Political Training in India. We have practiced specific need-based training to produce outstanding women leaders, youth leaders, leaders from weaker sections of the society among others.\n\nAt Prabodhini we offer innovative and tailor-made training programmes that actively engage individuals and organisations for capacity building and skill enhancement purposes at various levels. For any training to be successful and well targeted, organisational and institutional capacity gaps need to be correctly diagnosed, specific training needs must be assessed, and participants need to be selected strategically. Training success is predicted on adequate design with use of appropriate and professional pedagogic design, including opportunities to practice learned skills.\n\nAt Prabodhini, we believe that a high level of competence is always the result of systematic training and we endeavour to deliver the same. A variety of training programmes to cater to the needs of the voluntary sector and elected representatives of people is the hallmark of our mission. Our experts regularly assess the training needs of the respective sectors and develop tailor-made training packages.\n\nRMP provides capacity building and skill enhancement training for the following sectors:\n\n*Elected representatives\n*Political and social workers\n*Government and PSU Officials\n*CSOs, NGOs and SHGs\n*Industry and Financial Institutions\n*Academia\n*Other Democratic Institutions\n\nA variety of training programmes to cater to the needs of the voluntary sector and elected representatives of people is the hallmark of our mission. A high level of competence is the result of systematic training and we endeavour to do just that and RMP has been pioneering in providing innovative training programmes for all sectors engaging with diverse stakeholders and their needs. It gives us great pleasure to share that Prabodhini has conducted close to '''700 Capacity Building & Training Programmes and has directly trained close to 50000 participants from Jammu and Kashmir to Tamil Nadu''' in India till date who have further benefited their communities and people around them from our programmes. \nOur different centres are:\n\n* Centre for Human Rights Studies and Awareness (CHRSA), Mumbai\n* Centre for Leadership Development (CLD), New Delhi\n* Centre for Institution Building and Leadership Studies (CIBLS), Pune\n* Institute of Inclusive Governance (IIGH), Hyderabad\n* [[Indian Institute of Democratic Leadership (IIDL)]]\n\n\n==Public Awakening==\n===National Convention===\n\n{{multiple image|perrow = 1|total_width=300\n| image1 = National Convention 2020 - on Elimination of Single Use Plastics.jpg\n| caption1 = National Convention 2020\n| image2 = Transforming India Dialogue 2019.jpg\n| caption2 = Transforming India Dialogue 2019\n| image3 = Socio-Political Discourses at RMP.jpg\n| caption3 = Socio-Political Discourses at RMP\n}}\n\nRambhau Mhalgi Prabodhini (RMP) has been organizing the National Convention on various  social issues since 2010 where academicians, researchers, industry leads, social entrepreneurs, policymakers, and other stakeholders are invited to send in abstracts for research papers, successful case studies, innovations, anecdotes and posters for a cohesive policy dialogue to be conducted at the National Convention.

Amit Shah.\n\n===Public Awakening Lectures===\nRMP has been working actively in the domain of Public Awakening. All the contemporary issues that dominate our society are discussed openly at the seminars and symposia organised by the Prabodhini. We see to it that prominent personalities with different opinions on a topic take part and contribute to the discussions.  \n\nSince the inception of the activities for overall public awakening and opinion making in 1988, Prabodhini has organised seminars and symposia on several issues of national importance.\n\nSome of the prominent issues discussed on the Prabodhini platform in the past include:\n\n*Crisis of Drinking Water in Maharashtra (1991)\n*Perversion of the concept of Secularism (1992)\n*Commercialisation of Professional Education. (1993)\n*Crisis of Criminalisation of Politics (1995)\n*Issue of Large Scale Infiltration from Bangladesh and its Impact (1996)\n*Enhancing Employment Opportunities for Urban Women (1998)\n*People Oriented Administrative Reforms (2000)\n*National reconstruction through Voluntary Activism (2001)\n*Seminar on Maharashtra Water Policy (2002)\n*Tribal Development Convention (2003)\n*Relevance and Limitations of Social-Work Education (2004)\n*Convention against religion based reservations (2004)\n*National Seminar on Forest Laws, Tribal Communities; Livelihood and   Conservation (2005)\n*War On Terrorism (2008)\n*Development through Good Governance (2012)\n*Co-operative At Bhopal (Feb 2012)\n\n==Socio-Political Research==\nAt Prabodhini, we have a separate department for research on social and political issues. This department primarily undertakes studies and surveys with a professional approach.\nBesides this, we also conduct on-the-spot studies for the benefit of the activists, civil servants, and elected representatives. Hence, in Prabodhini, research projects are generally a group assignment. Experts and activists put their minds together and come up with a dispassionate analysis of the issue, invariably after an on-the-spot study of the given topic. In the process, activists grasp the art of forensic analysis while experts come to grip with ground realities. The outcome, in the form of a report, helps understand the issue and then form an informed opinion. We have come out with several such reports over the years.\n\n\nSome research reports prepared till now:\n\n*Growth of Naxalite Movement in Maharashtra (1989)\n*The Role of LTTE in Tamil Nadu Politics (1990)\n*Village Level Water Conservation Projects: A Comparative Analysis of Govt. and Non-Govt. projects (1993)\n*Enron power project x-rayed (1994)\n*Left Front Rule in West Bengal: Genesis, Growth and Decay (1997)\n*Empowering Women through 33% reservations in local bodies (1996)\n*Human Right Violations during the Solapur riots in 2002 (2002)\n*Development and Internal Security in Chhattisgarh: Impact of Naxalite Movement (2006)\n\nAt Rambhau Mhalgi Prabodhini, we offer two distinct and unique kinds of fellowships as a part of our efforts to promote People-oriented Research on Issues of socio-political, cultural and economic importance.\n\nTo encourage research and fact-finding studies, Prabodhini has instituted Vastav-Darshan Fellowship. Sponsored by our well-wishers, this annual fellowship is given to young journalists to undertake exhaustive research and analysis on a topic of their choice. We have also initiated a novel scheme called Researcher-in-Residence Scheme with a view to encouraging in-house research activities.\n\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.rmponweb.org/ Rambhau Mhalgi Prabodhini, official website]\n* [http://esango.un.org/paperless/Web?page=static&content=oral At 2010 ECOSOC High Level Segment ]\n* [https://iidl.org.in/ Indian Institute of Democratic Leadership]\n* [https://netritvasadhana.iidl.org.in/ Netritva Sadhana]\n* [https://knowledgeexcellencecentre.com/ Knowledge Excellence Cenctre]\n\n[[Category:Organizations established in 1982]]\n[[Category:Organisations based in Mumbai]]\n[[Category:Leadership training]]\n[[Category:Democracy]]\n[[Category:Governance]]\n[[Category:Research]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Indian charitable organisation}}\n{{more citations needed|date=August 2018}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2018}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=January 2016}}\n{{Infobox organization\n| name              = Rambhau Mhalgi Prabodhini\n| image             = Rambhau Mhalgi Prabodhini.jpg\n| type              = Charitable Trust in India\n| founded_date      = 1982\n| registration_id   = Registration No. 618 Bom./82\n| founder           = Uttamrao Patil (1982\u20131990)\n| key_people        = Pramod Mahajan (Chairman) (1990\u20131998)&(2000\u20132006), Vasantrao Patwardhan (Chairman) (1998\u20132000), Gopinath Munde (Chairman) (2006\u20132014), Prof. Aniruddha Deshpande, (Chairman) (present), Dr.Vinay Sahasrabuddhe (Vice-Chairman) (present), Ravindra Sathe (Director-General) (present)\n| location          = [[Mumbai]],[[Thane]], [[Pune]], [[New Delhi]]\n| focus             = Leadership development, Public awakening, Socio-political research\n| homepage          = {{URL|http://www.rmponweb.org}}\n}}\n\n==Background==\n'''Rambhau Mhalgi Prabodhini'''<ref>Keshav Srushti, [https://keshavsrushti.com/Home/KSCRambhauMhalgiPrabodhini \"Rambhau Mhalgi Prabodhini\"]</ref> is a not-for-profit organisation established in memory of the [[Rambhau Mhalgi]].

However, Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay passed away <ref> Mysterious death of Pt Deendayal [https://www.timesnownews.com/the-buzz/article/unsolved-midnight-murder-mystery-of-deendayal-upadhyaya-at-mughalsarai-junction/236101 \"TimesNow\"]</ref> before he could translate his vision into reality. After the abrupt and unfortunate departure of Panditji, [[Rambhau Mhalgi]], a prominent political figure from Maharashtra, made it his responsibility to materialise his idea.\n\nThis is how a concept propounded by two thinkers and activists came into existence in the form of Rambhau Mhalgi Prabodhini (RMP). Initially launched as a memorial of Late Rambhau Mhalgi, in 1982 RMP widened its scope to be established as a unique Training and Research Academy, primarily aimed at enhancing the capabilities of voluntary activists and elected representatives of the people. Over the years it has blossomed into a multi-dimensional institute imparting training to elected representatives, activists, civil servants and journalists, and a centre for overall public-awakening activities and research projects. Additionally, the institute also provides training facilities, accommodation and recreation facilities to corporate houses.\n\n===Rambhau Mhalgi (1921\u20131981)===\n\n[[File:Rambhau Mhalgi.jpg|thumb|Rambhau Mhalgi]]\n\nRambhau Mhalgi Prabodhini (RMP) focuses on developing the human capital and management capabilities with the backdrop of age-old Indian values, gets its inspiration from Late Rambhau Mhalgi, former Member of Indian Parliament and an outstanding representative of the people. As we know, the success of democracy depends on the dedication and efficiency of elected representatives.\n\nRamchandra Mhalgi (later called Rambhau) was born on 9 July 1921 in a well established agricultural family from Pune district in Maharashtra. The fourth child of Kashinathpant and Sarasvatibai, Ramchandra lost his mother at the age of 11. After passing the vernacular final exam in school, he joined the Sarasvati Mandir School in Pune and passed three grades in a single academic year, cleared the matriculation exam with first division in 1939. Ramchandra's contact with Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) dates back to his school days. After matriculation, instead of staying back for further studies, he went to Kerala, as \u2018Rambhau\u2019 an RSS pracharak (full-time social worker). Later, he returned to Pune for graduation but responding to the wish of the second RSS Chief (Sarsanghchalak) \u2013 Golwalkar Guruji, he joined RSS.\n\nWhen RSS <ref> Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, [http://rss.org/ \"RSS\"]</ref>  was banned in 1948, Rambhau went underground and continued the movement against injustice. After the ban was lifted, he went back to Pune, where he bagged both the degrees of LLB and MA and cleared the bar council exam. He was entrusted with the responsibility of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), the student wing of RSS and later that of Jan Sangh (the then political wing of RSS) and took up the responsibility as executive officer of the party in Maharashtra. With his leadership, creativity and practicality, he set up various fronts, trying to reach out to people from different walks of life. He helped create awareness about the merger of Jammu and Kashmir with India. While the party kept growing, he married a teacher \u2013 Manu Ghanekar. He balanced his personal, professional and political lives.\n\n==Vision&Mission==\n\n[[File:Rambhau Mhalgi Prabodhini logo.png|thumb|Rambhau Mhalgi Prabodhini logo]]\n\nRambhau Mhalgi Prabodhini\u2019s vision is to contribute to the efforts for evolving a democracy that delivers through multifarious activities aimed at empowering activists through capacity building, enlightening the citizenry through public education and creating an informed public opinion through objectively conducted research.\n\n*To work for building the capacities of the elected representatives, political party activists, and voluntary social workers while understanding the overall human resource development needs of these sectors.\n*To impart capacity building training with a view to empowering the functionaries belonging to democratic polity, voluntary activism, and institution building; work in a result-oriented manner, with a professional approach and without diluting the commitment to eternal human principles.\n*To offer training aimed at knowledge enrichment, skill development and sustaining the purity of purpose.\n*To offer the citizenry an academy where leadership traits could be honed in a scientific way enabling the society at large overcome the all pervading crisis of leadership.\n\n==Training&Capacity Building==\n\n[[File:Training of Parliamentarians at RMP.jpg|thumb|400px|Training of Parliamentarians at RMP]]\n\nLeadership usually rises from the grassroots. And it is Grass roots that it must strive to address. RMP awakens this sense of responsibility in those who rise from this grim.\n\nThe nation does not want able activists who have the potential to lead her. Tens of thousands of well-meaning individuals struggle in the dust laden streets for the rights of their societies; strive to bring change for betterment. The need is to channelize and guide this bridled force for development of the nation.\n\nRMP seeks to be the enabler that elevates these promising individuals to become leaders. We are proud to have developed and established the very concept of Political Training in India. We have practiced specific need-based training to produce outstanding women leaders, youth leaders, leaders from weaker sections of the society among others.\n\nAt Prabodhini we offer innovative and tailor-made training programmes that actively engage individuals and organisations for capacity building and skill enhancement purposes at various levels. For any training to be successful and well targeted, organisational and institutional capacity gaps need to be correctly diagnosed, specific training needs must be assessed, and participants need to be selected strategically. Training success is predicted on adequate design with use of appropriate and professional pedagogic design, including opportunities to practice learned skills.\n\nAt Prabodhini, we believe that a high level of competence is always the result of systematic training and we endeavour to deliver the same. A variety of training programmes to cater to the needs of the voluntary sector and elected representatives of people is the hallmark of our mission. Our experts regularly assess the training needs of the respective sectors and develop tailor-made training packages.\n\nRMP provides capacity building and skill enhancement training for the following sectors:\n\n*Elected representatives\n*Political and social workers\n*Government and PSU Officials\n*CSOs, NGOs and SHGs\n*Industry and Financial Institutions\n*Academia\n*Other Democratic Institutions\n\nA variety of training programmes to cater to the needs of the voluntary sector and elected representatives of people is the hallmark of our mission. A high level of competence is the result of systematic training and we endeavour to do just that and RMP has been pioneering in providing innovative training programmes for all sectors engaging with diverse stakeholders and their needs. It gives us great pleasure to share that Prabodhini has conducted close to '''700 Capacity Building & Training Programmes and has directly trained close to 50000 participants from Jammu and Kashmir to Tamil Nadu''' in India till date who have further benefited their communities and people around them from our programmes. \nOur different centres are:\n\n* Centre for Human Rights Studies and Awareness (CHRSA), Mumbai\n* Centre for Leadership Development (CLD), New Delhi\n* Centre for Institution Building and Leadership Studies (CIBLS), Pune\n* Institute of Inclusive Governance (IIGH), Hyderabad\n* [[Indian Institute of Democratic Leadership (IIDL)]]\n\n\n==Public Awakening==\n===National Convention===\n\n{{multiple image|perrow = 1|total_width=300\n| image1 = National Convention 2020 - on Elimination of Single Use Plastics.jpg\n| caption1 = National Convention 2020\n| image2 = Transforming India Dialogue 2019.jpg\n| caption2 = Transforming India Dialogue 2019\n| image3 = Socio-Political Discourses at RMP.jpg\n| caption3 = Socio-Political Discourses at RMP\n}}\n\nRambhau Mhalgi Prabodhini (RMP) has been organizing the National Convention on various  social issues since 2010 where academicians, researchers, industry leads, social entrepreneurs, policymakers, and other stakeholders are invited to send in abstracts for research papers, successful case studies, innovations, anecdotes and posters for a cohesive policy dialogue to be conducted at the National Convention.
