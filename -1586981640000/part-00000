The outer segment was reversed out, with white lettering on a green background on the team shirts.  The text around the clover logo on the shirts was also shortened from the official club crest to \"The Celtic Football Club\".<ref name=\"crests\" /> For their centenary year in 1988, a commemorative crest was worn, featuring the Celtic cross that appeared on their first shirts. The 1977 version was reinstated for season 1989\u201390.<ref name=\"numbers\"/>\n\nFrom 1945 onwards numbered shirts slowly came into use throughout Scotland, before becoming compulsory in 1960.  By this time Celtic were the last club in Britain to adopt the use of numbers on the team strip to identify players.  The traditionalist and idealistic Celtic chairman, [[Robert Kelly (football)|Robert Kelly]], baulked at the prospect of the famous green and white hoops being disfigured, and as such Celtic wore their numbers on the players' shorts.<ref name=\"numbers\"/> This unusual tradition survived until 1994, although numbered shirts were worn in [[UEFA competitions|European competition]] from 1975 onwards.<ref name=\"numbers\"/>  Celtic's tradition of wearing numbers on their shorts rather than on the back of their shirts was brought to an end when the [[Scottish Football League]] instructed Celtic to wear numbers on their shirts from the start of the 1994\u201395 season. Celtic responded by adding numbers to the top of their sleeves, however within a few weeks the football authorities ordered the club to attach them to the back of their shirts, where they appeared on a large white patch, breaking up the green and white hoops.<ref name=\"numbers\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;margin-left:1em;float:right\"\n!'''Period'''<ref name=\"numbers\" />\n!'''Kit manufacturer'''<ref name=\"numbers\" />\n!'''Shirt sponsor'''<ref name=\"numbers\" />\n|-\n|1960s\u20131984\n| rowspan=\"8\" |[[Umbro]]\n|''none''\n|-\n|1984\u20131991\n|CR Smith\n|-\n|1991\u20131992\n|Peoples\n|-\n|1992\u20131993\n|''none''\n|-\n|1993\u20131997\n|CR Smith\n|-\n|1997\u20131999\n|Umbro\n|-\n|1999\u20132003\n|[[NTL Incorporated|NTL]]\n|-\n|2003\u20132005\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Carling brewery|Carling]]\n|-\n|2005\u20132010\n| rowspan=\"3\" |[[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]\n|-\n|2010\u20132013\n|[[Tennents]]\n|-\n|2013\u20132015\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Magners]]\n|-\n|2015\u20132016\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[New Balance]]\n|-\n|2016\u20132020\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Dafabet]]\n|-\n|2020 -\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Adidas]]\n\n|}\n\nIn 1984 Celtic took up shirt sponsorship for the first time, with Fife-based double glazing firm CR Smith having their logo emblazoned on the front of the team jersey.<ref name=\"trshirt\">{{cite web|url=http://tribal-colours.co.uk/?portfolio=242 |title=Celtic |work=Tribal Colours |accessdate=5 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818042039/http://tribal-colours.co.uk/?portfolio=242 |archivedate=18 August 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Halliday |first=Stephen |url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/latest/magners-shirt-cash-for-celtic-ends-old-firm-double-deals-1-2727282 |title=Magners shirt cash for Celtic ends Old Firm double deals|work=The Scotsman |date=9 January 2013 |accessdate=5 August 2013}}</ref>  In season 1991\u201392, Celtic switched to Glasgow-based car sales company Peoples as sponsors.<ref>{{cite web|last=Halliday|first=Stephen|title=Magners shirt cash for Celtic ends Old Firm double deals|url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/latest/magners-shirt-cash-for-celtic-ends-old-firm-double-deals-1-2727282|website=The Scotsman|accessdate=28 August 2015|date=9 January 2013}}</ref>  The club failed to secure a shirt sponsor for season 1992\u201393, and for the first time since the early 1980s Celtic took to the field in 'unblemished' hoops.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wsc.co.uk/wsc-daily/939-August-2008/990-celtic-cross |title=Celtic cross |work=When Saturday Comes |date=9 July 2012 |accessdate=5 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230233524/http://www.wsc.co.uk/wsc-daily/939-August-2008/990-celtic-cross |archive-date=30 December 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"9293p1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ntvcelticfanzine.com/the%2090s/90s9293pt1.htm |title=92\u201393 part 1 |work=NTV Celtic Fanzine |accessdate=5 August 2013}}</ref>  Perversely, despite the loss of marketing revenue, sales of the new unsponsored replica top increased dramatically.<ref name=\"9293p1\" />  Celtic regained shirt sponsorship for season 1993\u201394, with CR Smith returning as shirt sponsors in a four-year deal.<ref name=\"trshirt\" /><ref>{{cite web|first=Jim|last=Reynolds|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/mcginlay-move-hibs-tell-celtic-they-must-wait-in-the-wings-1.755005 |title=McGinlay move: Hibs tell Celtic they must wait in the wings |work=Herald Scotland |date=16 June 1993 |accessdate=5 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005 the club severed their connection with [[Umbro]], suppliers of their kits since the 1960s and entered into a contract with [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]].

The outer segment was reversed out, with white lettering on a green background on the team shirts.  The text around the clover logo on the shirts was also shortened from the official club crest to \"The Celtic Football Club\".<ref name=\"crests\" /> For their centenary year in 1988, a commemorative crest was worn, featuring the Celtic cross that appeared on their first shirts. The 1977 version was reinstated for season 1989\u201390.<ref name=\"numbers\"/>\n\nFrom 1945 onwards numbered shirts slowly came into use throughout Scotland, before becoming compulsory in 1960.  By this time Celtic were the last club in Britain to adopt the use of numbers on the team strip to identify players.  The traditionalist and idealistic Celtic chairman, [[Robert Kelly (football)|Robert Kelly]], baulked at the prospect of the famous green and white hoops being disfigured, and as such Celtic wore their numbers on the players' shorts.<ref name=\"numbers\"/> This unusual tradition survived until 1994, although numbered shirts were worn in [[UEFA competitions|European competition]] from 1975 onwards.<ref name=\"numbers\"/>  Celtic's tradition of wearing numbers on their shorts rather than on the back of their shirts was brought to an end when the [[Scottish Football League]] instructed Celtic to wear numbers on their shirts from the start of the 1994\u201395 season. Celtic responded by adding numbers to the top of their sleeves, however within a few weeks the football authorities ordered the club to attach them to the back of their shirts, where they appeared on a large white patch, breaking up the green and white hoops.<ref name=\"numbers\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;margin-left:1em;float:right\"\n!'''Period'''<ref name=\"numbers\" />\n!'''Kit manufacturer'''<ref name=\"numbers\" />\n!'''Shirt sponsor'''<ref name=\"numbers\" />\n|-\n|1960s\u20131984\n| rowspan=\"8\" |[[Umbro]]\n|''none''\n|-\n|1984\u20131991\n|CR Smith\n|-\n|1991\u20131992\n|Peoples\n|-\n|1992\u20131993\n|''none''\n|-\n|1993\u20131997\n|CR Smith\n|-\n|1997\u20131999\n|Umbro\n|-\n|1999\u20132003\n|[[NTL Incorporated|NTL]]\n|-\n|2003\u20132005\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Carling brewery|Carling]]\n|-\n|2005\u20132010\n| rowspan=\"3\" |[[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]\n|-\n|2010\u20132013\n|[[Tennents]]\n|-\n|2013\u20132015\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Magners]]\n|-\n|2015\u20132016\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[New Balance]]\n|-\n|2016\u20132020\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Dafabet]]\n|-\n|2020 -\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Adidas]]\n\n|}\n\nIn 1984 Celtic took up shirt sponsorship for the first time, with Fife-based double glazing firm CR Smith having their logo emblazoned on the front of the team jersey.<ref name=\"trshirt\">{{cite web|url=http://tribal-colours.co.uk/?portfolio=242 |title=Celtic |work=Tribal Colours |accessdate=5 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818042039/http://tribal-colours.co.uk/?portfolio=242 |archivedate=18 August 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Halliday |first=Stephen |url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/latest/magners-shirt-cash-for-celtic-ends-old-firm-double-deals-1-2727282 |title=Magners shirt cash for Celtic ends Old Firm double deals|work=The Scotsman |date=9 January 2013 |accessdate=5 August 2013}}</ref>  In season 1991\u201392, Celtic switched to Glasgow-based car sales company Peoples as sponsors.<ref>{{cite web|last=Halliday|first=Stephen|title=Magners shirt cash for Celtic ends Old Firm double deals|url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/latest/magners-shirt-cash-for-celtic-ends-old-firm-double-deals-1-2727282|website=The Scotsman|accessdate=28 August 2015|date=9 January 2013}}</ref>  The club failed to secure a shirt sponsor for season 1992\u201393, and for the first time since the early 1980s Celtic took to the field in 'unblemished' hoops.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wsc.co.uk/wsc-daily/939-August-2008/990-celtic-cross |title=Celtic cross |work=When Saturday Comes |date=9 July 2012 |accessdate=5 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230233524/http://www.wsc.co.uk/wsc-daily/939-August-2008/990-celtic-cross |archive-date=30 December 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"9293p1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ntvcelticfanzine.com/the%2090s/90s9293pt1.htm |title=92\u201393 part 1 |work=NTV Celtic Fanzine |accessdate=5 August 2013}}</ref>  Perversely, despite the loss of marketing revenue, sales of the new unsponsored replica top increased dramatically.<ref name=\"9293p1\" />  Celtic regained shirt sponsorship for season 1993\u201394, with CR Smith returning as shirt sponsors in a four-year deal.<ref name=\"trshirt\" /><ref>{{cite web|first=Jim|last=Reynolds|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/mcginlay-move-hibs-tell-celtic-they-must-wait-in-the-wings-1.755005 |title=McGinlay move: Hibs tell Celtic they must wait in the wings |work=Herald Scotland |date=16 June 1993 |accessdate=5 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005 the club severed their connection with [[Umbro]], suppliers of their kits since the 1960s and entered into a contract with [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]].

{"title_page": "List of federal political scandals in the United States", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikimedia list article}}\n{{Use mdy dates | date=November 2017}}\n{{dynamic list}}\n{{Political corruption sidebar}}\n\nThis article provides a list of [[political scandal]]s that involve officials from the government of the [[United States]], sorted from oldest to most recent.\n\n==Scope and organization of political scandals==\nThis article is organized by presidential terms in order, older to recent, and then divided into scandals of the federal executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government. Members of both parties are listed under the term of the president in office at the time the scandal took place, even though they may not be connected with the presiding president.\n\nIn this article, the term \"[[politician]]\" (a person who is professionally involved in politics) includes not only those elected, but also party officials, candidates for office, their staffs and appointees. Please note that every president directly selects, appoints or hires several thousand people. Each of them selects thousands more. Private citizens should only be mentioned when they are closely linked to the scandal or politician, such as [[Jack Abramoff]]. This list also does not include crimes that occur outside the politician's tenure (such as before or after his tenure) unless they specifically stem from acts made while in office and discovered later.\n\nScandal is defined as \"loss of or damage to reputation caused by actual or apparent violation of morality or propriety\". Scandals are separate from 'controversies', (which implies two differing points of view) and 'unpopularity'. Many decisions are controversial, many decisions are unpopular, that alone does not make them scandals. Breaking the law is a scandal. The finding of a court is the sole method used to determine a violation of law, but it is not the sole method of determining a scandal. Also included as scandals are politicians who resign, quit, run, or commit suicide while being investigated or threatened with investigation.\n\nNotoriety is a major determinant of a scandal, that is, the amount of press dedicated to it. Misunderstandings, breaches of ethics, unproven crimes or cover-ups may or may not result in inclusion depending on the standing of the accused, the amount of publicity generated, and the seriousness of the crime, if any. Drunk driving may be a conviction, but is usually too minor and too common to mention unless there are multiple convictions and/or jail time.\n\nGiven the political nature of Congress in which the leading party has determining power, politicians who are rebuked, denounced, censured, admonished, condemned, suspended, reprimanded, found in contempt, found to have acted improperly, or used poor judgement are ''not'' included unless the scandal is exceptional or leads to expulsion or conviction.\n\n==Scandals during government under the Articles of Confederation (1777\u20131789)==\n\n=== Executive branch ===\n* [[Conway Cabal]] created a movement or conspiracy to remove George Washington as commander of the Continental Army by [[Thomas Conway]] and [[Horatio Gates]].

Bush administration controversies]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wikimedia list article}}\n{{Use mdy dates | date=November 2017}}\n{{dynamic list}}\n{{Political corruption sidebar}}\n\nThis article provides a list of [[political scandal]]s that involve officials from the government of the [[United States]], sorted from oldest to most recent.\n\n==Scope and organization of political scandals==\nThis article is organized by presidential terms in order, older to recent, and then divided into scandals of the federal executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government. Members of both parties are listed under the term of the president in office at the time the scandal took place, even though they may not be connected with the presiding president.\n\nIn this article, the term \"[[politician]]\" (a person who is professionally involved in politics) includes not only those elected, but also party officials, candidates for office, their staffs and appointees. Please note that every president directly selects, appoints or hires several thousand people. Each of them selects thousands more. Private citizens should only be mentioned when they are closely linked to the scandal or politician, such as [[Jack Abramoff]]. This list also does not include crimes that occur outside the politician's tenure (such as before or after his tenure) unless they specifically stem from acts made while in office and discovered later.\n\nScandal is defined as \"loss of or damage to reputation caused by actual or apparent violation of morality or propriety\". Scandals are separate from 'controversies', (which implies two differing points of view) and 'unpopularity'. Many decisions are controversial, many decisions are unpopular, that alone does not make them scandals. Breaking the law is a scandal. The finding of a court is the sole method used to determine a violation of law, but it is not the sole method of determining a scandal. Also included as scandals are politicians who resign, quit, run, or commit suicide while being investigated or threatened with investigation.\n\nNotoriety is a major determinant of a scandal, that is, the amount of press dedicated to it. Misunderstandings, breaches of ethics, unproven crimes or cover-ups may or may not result in inclusion depending on the standing of the accused, the amount of publicity generated, and the seriousness of the crime, if any. Drunk driving may be a conviction, but is usually too minor and too common to mention unless there are multiple convictions and/or jail time.\n\nGiven the political nature of Congress in which the leading party has determining power, politicians who are rebuked, denounced, censured, admonished, condemned, suspended, reprimanded, found in contempt, found to have acted improperly, or used poor judgement are ''not'' included unless the scandal is exceptional or leads to expulsion or conviction.\n\n==Scandals during government under the Articles of Confederation (1777\u20131789)==\n\n=== Executive branch ===\n* [[Conway Cabal]] created a movement or conspiracy to remove George Washington as commander of the Continental Army by [[Thomas Conway]] and [[Horatio Gates]].

Sympathetic to both business and labor, Roosevelt avoided labor strife, most notably negotiating a settlement to the great [[Coal Strike of 1902]]. He vigorously promoted the [[Conservation movement#United States|conservation movement]], emphasizing efficient use of natural resources. He dramatically expanded the system of [[national park]]s and [[United States National Forest|national forests]]. After 1906, he moved to the [[left-wing politics|left]], attacking big business, proposing a welfare state, and supporting labor unions.\n\nIn foreign affairs, Roosevelt sought to uphold the [[Monroe Doctrine]] and to establish the United States as a strong naval power and took charge of building the [[Panama Canal]], which greatly increased access to the Pacific and increased American security interests and trade opportunities. He inherited the [[Territories of the United States|colonial empire]] acquired in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] (1898). He ended the [[United States Military Government in Cuba]] and committed to a long-term occupation of [[Insular Government of the Philippine Islands|the Philippines]]. Much of his foreign policy focused on the threats posed by Japan in the Pacific and Germany in the [[Caribbean Sea]]. Seeking to minimize European power in Latin America, he mediated the [[Venezuelan crisis of 1902\u201303|Venezuela Crisis]] and declared the [[Roosevelt Corollary]]. Roosevelt mediated the [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904-1905), for which he won the [[List of Nobel Peace Prize laureates|1906 Nobel Peace Prize]]. He pursued closer relations with Great Britain.  Biographer William Harbaugh argues:\n:In foreign affairs, Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s legacy is judicious support of the national interest and promotion of world stability through the maintenance of a balance of power; creation or strengthening of international agencies, and resort to their use when practicable ; and implicit resolve to use military force, if feasible, to foster legitimate American interests. In domestic affairs, it is the use of government to advance the public interest. \u201cIf on this new continent,\u201d he said, \u201cwe merely build another country of great but unjustly divided material prosperity, we shall have done nothing.\u201d<ref>William H.

He broadly adhered to most Republican positions on economic issues, with the partial exception of the [[protective tariff]].

[[Progressivism in the United States|Progressivism]] was among the most powerful political forces of the day, and Roosevelt was its most articulate spokesperson. Progressivism had dual aspects. First, progressivism promoted use of science, engineering, technology, and social sciences to address the nation's problems, and identify ways to eliminate waste and inefficiency and promote modernization.<ref>see George Mowry, ''The Era of Theodore Roosevelt and the Birth of Modern America, 1900\u20131912'' (1954), ch. 1</ref> Those promoting progressivism also campaigned against corruption among political machines, labor unions, and trusts of new, large corporations, which emerged at the turn of the century.<ref>see Lewis L. Gould, ''The Presidency of Theodore Roosevelt.'' (1991), ch 1</ref> In describing Roosevelt's priorities and characteristics as president, historian G. Warren Chessman noted Roosevelt's {{Quote|insistence upon the public responsibility of large corporations; publicity as a first remedy for trusts; regulation of railroad rates; mediation of the conflict of capital and labor; conservation of natural resources; and protection of the less fortunate members of society.<ref>Chessman, p 6</ref>}}\n\n===Trust busting and regulation===\n{{see also|History of United States antitrust law}}\n\nIn the late-nineteenth century, several large businesses, including [[Standard Oil]], had either bought their rivals or had established business arrangements that effectively stifled competition. Many companies followed the model of Standard Oil, which organized itself as a [[trust (business)|trust]] in which several component corporations were controlled by one [[board of director]]s. While Congress had passed the 1890 [[Sherman Antitrust Act]] to provide some federal regulation of trusts, the Supreme Court had limited the power of the act in the case of ''[[United States v. E. C. Knight Co.]]''.<ref>Morris (2001) pp 27\u201330</ref> By 1902, the 100 largest corporations held control of 40 percent of industrial capital in the United States. Roosevelt did not oppose all trusts, but sought to regulate trusts that he believed harmed the public, which he labeled as \"bad trusts.\"{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=26\u201327}}\n\n====First term====\nUpon taking office, Roosevelt proposed federal regulations of trusts. As the states had not prevented the growth of what he viewed as harmful trusts, Roosevelt advocated the creation of Cabinet department designed to regulate corporations engaged in [[interstate commerce]].{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=27\u201328, 31\u201332}} He also favored amending the [[Interstate Commerce Act of 1887]], which had failed to prevent the consolidation of railroads.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=37\u201338}} In February 1902, the Justice Department announced that it would file an antitrust suit against the [[Northern Securities Company]], a railroad [[holding company]] that had been formed in 1901 by [[J. P. Morgan]], [[James J. Hill]], and [[E. H. Harriman]].{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=45\u201347}} As the Justice Department lacked an antitrust division, Attorney General Knox, a former corporate lawyer, personally led the suit. While the case was working its way through court, Knox filed another case against the \"Beef Trust,\" which had become unpopular due to rising meat prices.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=49\u201350}} Combined with his earlier rhetoric, the suits signaled Roosevelt's resolve to strengthen the federal regulation of trusts.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=45\u201347}}\n\nAfter the 1902 elections, Roosevelt called for a ban on railroad rebates to large industrial concerns, as well as for the creation of a [[Bureau of Corporations]] to study and report on monopolistic practices.<ref>Morris (2001) p. 195\u2013196</ref> To pass his antitrust package through Congress, Roosevelt appealed directly to the people, casting the legislation as a blow against the malevolent power of Standard Oil. Roosevelt's campaign proved successful, and he won congressional approval of the creation of the [[United States Department of Commerce and Labor|Department of Commerce and Labor]], which included the [[Bureau of Corporations]].<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 205\u2013208</ref> The Bureau of Corporations was designed to monitor and report on anti-competitive practices; Roosevelt believed that large companies would be less likely to engage in anti-competitive practices if such practices were publicized. At Knox's request, Congress also authorized the creation of the [[United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division|Antitrust Division]] of the Department of Justice. Roosevelt also won passage of the [[Elkins Act]], which restricted the granting of railroad rebates.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=101\u2013102}}\n\nIn March 1904, the Supreme Court ruled for the government in the case of ''[[Northern Securities Co. v. United States]]''. According to historian [[Michael McGerr]], the case represented the federal government's first victorious prosecution of a \"single, tightly integrated interstate corporation.\"<ref>McGerr (2003), p. 157</ref> The following year, the administration won another major victory in [[Swift and Company v. United States]], which broke up the Beef Trust. The evidence at trial demonstrated that, prior to 1902, the \"Big Six\" leading meatpackers had engaged in a conspiracy to fix prices and divide the market for livestock and meat in their quest for higher prices and higher profits. They blacklisted competitors who failed to go along, used false bids, and accepted rebates from the railroads. After they were hit with federal injunctions in 1902, the Big Six had merged into one company, allowing them to continue to control the trade internally. Speaking for the unanimous court, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. held that interstate commerce included actions that were part of the chain where the chain was clearly interstate in character. In this case, the chain ran from farm to retail store and crossed many state lines.<ref>\"The Supreme Court upholds Prosecution of the Beef Trust,\" in Frank N. Magill, ed., ''Great Events from History II: Business and Commerce Series Volume 1 1897-1923'' (1994) pp 107-111</ref>\n\n====Second term====\nFollowing his re-election, Roosevelt sought to quickly enact a bold legislative agenda, focusing especially on legislation that would build upon the regulatory accomplishments of his first term. Events during his first term had convinced Roosevelt that legislation enacting additional federal regulation of interstate commerce was necessary, as  the states were incapable of regulating large trusts that operated across state lines and the overworked Department of Justice was unable to provide an adequate check on monopolistic practices through antitrust cases alone.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=145\u2013146}} Roused by reports in [[McClure's|McClure's Magazine]], many Americans joined Roosevelt in calling for an enhancement to the Elkins Act, which had done relatively little to restrict the granting of railroad rebates.<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 417\u2013419</ref> Roosevelt also sought to strengthen the powers of the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] (ICC), which had been created in 1887 to regulate railroads.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=145\u2013146}} Roosevelt's call for regulatory legislation, published in his 1905 message to Congress, encountered strong opposition from business interests and conservative congressmen.<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 422\u2013429</ref>\n\nWhen Congress reconvened in late 1905, Roosevelt asked Senator [[Jonathan P. Dolliver]] of Iowa to introduce a bill that would incorporate Roosevelt's railroad regulatory proposals, and set about mobilizing public and congressional support for the bill. The bill was also taken up in the House, where it became known as the Hepburn Bill, named after Congressman [[William Peters Hepburn]].<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 428\u2013433</ref> While the bill passed the House with relative ease, the Senate, dominated by conservative Republicans like [[Nelson Aldrich]], posed a greater challenge.<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 442\u2013443</ref> Seeking to defeat reform efforts, Aldrich arranged it so that Democrat [[Benjamin Tillman]], a Southern senator who Roosevelt despised, was left in charge of the bill.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=155\u2013156}} Because railroad regulation was widely popular, opponents of the Hepburn Bill focused on the role of courts in reviewing the ICC's rate-setting. Roosevelt and progressives wanted to limit judicial review to issues of procedural fairness, while conservatives favored [[Standard of review|\"broad review\"]] that would allow judges to determine whether the rates themselves were fair.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=155\u2013156}}\n\nAfter Roosevelt and Tillman were unable to assemble a bipartisan majority behind a bill that restricted judicial review, Roosevelt accepted an amendment written by Senator Allison that contained vague language allowing for court review of the ICC's rate-setting power.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=156\u2013157}} With the inclusion of the Allison amendment, the Senate passed the Hepburn Bill in a 71-to-3 vote.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=158\u2013159}} After both houses of Congress passed a uniform law, Roosevelt signed the [[Hepburn Act]] into law on June 29, 1906. In addition to rate-setting, the Hepburn Act also granted the ICC regulatory power over pipeline fees, storage contracts, and several other aspects of railroad operations.<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 445\u2013448</ref> Though some conservatives believed that the Allison amendment had granted broad review powers to the courts, a subsequent Supreme Court case limited judicial power to review the ICC's rate-setting powers.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=158\u2013159}}\n\nIn response to public clamor largely arising from the popularity of [[Upton Sinclair]]'s novel, ''[[The Jungle]]'', Roosevelt also pushed Congress to enact food safety regulations. Opposition to a meat inspection bill was strongest in the House, due to the presence of conservative Speaker of the House [[Joseph Gurney Cannon]] and allies of the meatpacking industry.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=160\u2013162}} Roosevelt and Cannon agreed to a compromise bill that became the [[Meat Inspection Act]] of 1906. Congress simultaneously passed the [[Pure Food and Drug Act]], which received strong support in both the House and the Senate.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=162\u2013163}} Collectively, the laws provided for the labeling of foods and drugs and the inspection of livestock, and mandated sanitary conditions at meatpacking plants.<ref>Blum (1954) pp 43\u201344</ref>\n\nSeeking to bolster antitrust regulations, Roosevelt and his allies introduced a bill to enhance the Sherman Act in 1908, but it was defeated in Congress.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=272\u2013274}} In the aftermath of a series of scandals involving major [[Insurance in the United States|insurance]] companies, Roosevelt sought to establish a National Bureau of Insurance to provide federal regulation, but this proposal was also defeated.<ref>McGerr (2003), pp. 172\u2013174</ref> Roosevelt continued to launch antitrust suits in his second term, and a suit against Standard Oil in 1906 would lead to that company's break-up in 1911.<ref>McGerr (2003), pp. 158\u2013159</ref> In addition to the antitrust suits and major regulatory reform efforts, the Roosevelt administration also won the cooperation of many large trusts, who consented to regulation by the Bureau of Corporations.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=204\u2013205}} Among the companies that voluntarily agreed to regulation was [[U.S. Steel]], which avoided an antitrust suit by allowing the Bureau of Corporations to investigate its operations.<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 477\u2013478</ref>\n\n===Conservation===\n[[Image:TR-Enviro.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.2|A political cartoon describing Roosevelt as \"a practical forester\"]]\n{{Further|List of lands nationalized by Theodore Roosevelt through executive action}}\n\nRoosevelt was a prominent [[conservation movement|conservationist]], putting the issue high on the national agenda.<ref>Benjamin Redekop, (2014). \"Embodying the Story: The Conservation Leadership of Theodore Roosevelt\" in ''Leadership'' DOI: 10.1177/1742715014546875.

Roosevelt increased Pinchot's power over environmental issues by transferring control over [[United States National Forest|national forests]] from the Department of the Interior to the Bureau of Forestry, which was part of the Agriculture Department. Pinchot's agency was renamed to the [[United States Forest Service]], and Pinchot presided over the implementation of assertive conservationist policies in national forests.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=191\u2013192}}\n\nRoosevelt encouraged the [[Newlands Reclamation Act]] of 1902, which promoted federal construction of dams to irrigate small farms and placed 230 million acres (360,000&nbsp;mi\u00b2 or 930,000&nbsp;km\u00b2) under federal protection. In 1906, Congress passed the [[Antiquities Act]], granting the president the power to create [[National monument (United States)|national monuments]] in federal lands.

The UMW organized an [[Coal Strike of 1902|anthracite coal strike]] in May 1902, seeking an [[eight-hour day]] and pay increases. Hoping to reach a negotiated solution with the help of [[Mark Hanna]]'s [[National Civic Federation]], UMW president [[John Mitchell (United Mine Workers)|John Mitchell]] prevented bituminous coal miners from launching a [[Solidarity action|sympathy strike]]. The mine owners, who wanted to crush the UMW, refused to negotiate, and the strike continued. In the ensuing months, the price of coal increased from five dollars per ton to above fifteen dollars per ton. Seeking to help the two parties arrive at a solution, Roosevelt hosted the UMW leaders and mine operators at the White House in October 1902, but the mine owners refused to negotiate. Through the efforts of Roosevelt, Root, and J.P. Morgan, the mine operators agreed to the establishment of a presidential commission to propose a solution to the strike. In March 1903, the commission mandated pay increases and a reduction in the workday from ten hours to nine hours. At the insistence of the mine owners, the UMW was not granted official recognition as the representative of the miners.<ref>McGerr (2003), pp. 118\u2013125</ref>\n\nRoosevelt refrained from major interventions in labor disputes after 1902, but state and federal courts increasingly became involved, issuing [[injunction]]s to prevent labor actions.<ref>McGerr (2003), pp. 143\u2013144</ref> Tensions were particularly high in Colorado, where the [[Western Federation of Miners]] led a series of strikes that became part of a struggle known as the [[Colorado Labor Wars]]. Roosevelt did not intervene in the Colorado Labor Wars, but Governor [[James Hamilton Peabody]] dispatched the Colorado National Guard to crush the strikes. In 1905, radical union leaders like [[Mary Harris Jones]] and [[Eugene V.

Roosevelt was widely criticized by contemporary newspapers for the discharges, and Senator [[Joseph B. Foraker]] won passage of a congressional resolution directing the administration to turn over all documents related to the case.<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 471\u2013473</ref> The controversy hung over the remainder of his presidency, although the Senate eventually concluded that the dismissals had been justified.<ref>Morris (2001) p. 511</ref>\n\n===Panic of 1907===\n{{Further|Panic of 1907}}\n\nIn 1907, Roosevelt faced the greatest domestic economic crisis since the [[Panic of 1893]]. The U.S. [[stock market]] entered a slump in early 1907, and many in the financial markets blamed Roosevelt's regulatory policies for the decline in stock prices.<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 495\u2013496</ref> Lacking a strong [[History of central banking in the United States|central banking system]], the government was unable to coordinate a response to the economic downturn.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=112\u2013113}} The slump reached a full-blown panic in October 1907, when two investors failed to take over [[United Copper]]. Working with Secretary of the Treasury Cortelyou, financier J.P. Morgan organized a group of businessmen to avert a crash by pledging their own money. Roosevelt aided Morgan's intervention by allowing U.S. Steel to acquire the [[Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company]] despite antitrust concerns, and by authorizing Cortelyou to raise bonds and commit federal funds to the banks.<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 497\u2013501</ref>  Roosevelt's reputation in [[Wall Street]] fell to new lows following the panic, but the president remained broadly popular.<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 501, 504\u2013505</ref> In the aftermath of the panic, most congressional leaders agreed on the need to reform the nation's financial system. With the support of Roosevelt, Senator Aldrich introduced a bill to allow [[History of central banking in the United States#1863\u20131913: National Banks|National Banks]] to issue emergency currency, but his proposal was defeated by Democrats and progressive Republicans who believed that it was overly favorable to Wall Street. Congress instead passed the [[Aldrich\u2013Vreeland Act]], which created the [[National Monetary Commission]] to study the nation's banking system; the commission's recommendations would later form the basis of the [[Federal Reserve System]].{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=270\u2013272}}\n\n===Tariffs===\n{{see also|Tariffs in United States history}}\n\nMany Republicans viewed the tariff as the key plank of their economic policy in the aftermath of the Panic of 1893.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=23\u201324}} The tariff protected domestic manufacturing against foreign competition, and was also a major source of government funding, constituting over one-third of federal revenue in 1901.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|p=35}} McKinley had been a committed protectionist, and the [[Dingley Act|Dingley Tariff]] of 1897 represented a major increase in tariff rates. McKinley also negotiated bilateral reciprocity treaties with France, Argentina, and other countries in an attempt to expand foreign trade while still keeping overall tariff rates high.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=23\u201324}} Unlike McKinley and other nineteenth-century Republican presidents, Roosevelt had never been a strong advocate of the protective tariff, nor did he place a high emphasis on tariffs in general.{{Sfn|Gould|2003|p= 133}} When Roosevelt took office, McKinley's reciprocity treaties were pending before the Senate, and many assumed that they would be ratified despite the opposition of Aldrich and other conservatives. After conferring with Aldrich, Roosevelt decided not to push Senate ratification of the treaties in order to avoid an intra-party conflict.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=24\u201325}} He did, however, successfully pressure Congress to ratify reciprocal tariff treaties with the Philippines and, after overcoming domestic sugar interests, with Cuba.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|p=104}}\n\nThe issue of the tariff lay dormant throughout Roosevelt's first term,{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=25\u201326}} but it continued to be an important campaign topic for both parties.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=60\u201361}} Proponents of tariff reduction asked Roosevelt to call a special session of Congress to address the issue in early 1905, but Roosevelt was only willing to issue a cautious endorsement of a cut in tariff rates, and no further action was taken on the tariff during Roosevelt's tenure.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=141\u2013142}} In the first decade of the 20th century, the country experienced a period of sustained [[inflation]] for the first time since the early 1870s, and Democrats and other free trade advocates blamed rising prices on high tariff rates.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=32\u201333}} Tariff reduction became an increasingly important national issue, and Congress would pass a major tariff law in 1909, shortly after Roosevelt left office.{{Sfn|Gould|2003|pp = 174\u2013175}}\n\n===Move to Left Center, 1907\u201309===\n[[File:TR-Farewell.JPG|thumb|350px|right|In his waning days in office, Roosevelt proposed numerous reforms.]]\n\nBy 1907, Roosevelt identified himself with the \"left center\" of the Republican Party.<ref>In December 1907 he wrote his British friend [[Arthur Hamilton Lee]]. \"To use the terminology of Continental politics, I am trying to keep the left center together.\" Elting E.

He believed that 19th-century entrepreneurs had risked their fortunes on innovations and new businesses, and that these capitalists had been rightly rewarded. By contrast, he believed that 20th-century capitalists risked little but nonetheless reaped huge and unjust, economic rewards. Without a redistribution of wealth away from the upper class, Roosevelt feared that the country would turn to radicalism or fall to revolution.<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 430\u2013431, 436</ref>\n\nIn January 1908, Roosevelt sent a special message to Congress, calling for the restoration of an [[Workers' compensation|employer's liability law]], which had recently been struck down by the Supreme Court due to its application to intrastate corporations.<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 505\u2013507</ref> He also called for a national [[Incorporation (business)|incorporation]] law (all corporations had state charters, which varied greatly state by state), a [[Income tax in the United States|federal income tax]] and [[Estate tax in the United States|inheritance tax]] (both targeted at the rich), limits on the use of court [[injunction]]s against labor unions during strikes (injunctions were a powerful weapon that mostly helped business), an [[Eight-hour day|eight-hour work day]] for federal employees, a [[United States Postal Savings System|postal savings system]] (to provide competition for local banks), and legislation barring corporations from contributing to political campaigns.<ref>Brands, ''TR'' (1997) ch 21</ref>{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=235\u2013236}}\n\nRoosevelt's increasingly radical stance proved popular in the Midwest and Pacific Coast, and among farmers, teachers, clergymen, clerical workers and some proprietors, but appeared as divisive and unnecessary to eastern Republicans, corporate executives, lawyers, party workers, and many members of Congress.<ref name=\"Mowry 1954\">Mowry (1954)</ref> Populist Democrats such as William Jennings Bryan expressed admiration for Roosevelt's message, and one Southern newspaper called for Roosevelt to run as a Democrat in 1908, with Bryan as his running mate.<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 508-509</ref> Despite the public support offered by Democratic congressional leaders like [[John Sharp Williams]], Roosevelt never seriously considered leaving the Republican Party during his presidency.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|p=270}} Roosevelt's move to the left was supported by some congressional Republicans and many in the public, but conservative Republicans such as Senator Nelson Aldrich and Speaker [[Joseph Gurney Cannon]] remained in control of Congress.<ref name=\"Morris 2001 pp. 510\u2013511\">Morris (2001) pp. 510\u2013511</ref> These Republican leaders blocked the more ambitious aspects of Roosevelt's agenda,<ref>Brands, ''TR'' (1997) ch 27</ref> though Roosevelt won passage of a new [[Federal Employers Liability Act]] and other laws, such as a restriction of child labor in Washington, D.C.<ref name=\"Morris 2001 pp. 510\u2013511\"/>\n\n===States admitted===\n{{Further|Oklahoma Enabling Act}}\n\nOne new state, [[Oklahoma]], was [[Admission to the Union|admitted to the Union]] while Roosevelt was in office.

France and Britain had agreed that  France would dominate Morocco, but Germany suddenly protested aggressively, with the disregard for quiet diplomacy characteristic of Kaiser Wilhelm. Berlin asked Roosevelt to serve as a intermediary, and he helped arrange a multinational conference at [[Algeciras Conference|Algeciras, Morocco]], where the crisis was resolved.

Roosevelt believed that [[Cuba]] should be quickly granted independence and that [[Puerto Rico]] should remain a semi-autonomous possession under the terms of the [[Foraker Act]]. He wanted U.S. forces to remain in the [[Philippines]] to establish a stable, democratic government, even in the face of an [[Philippine\u2013American War|insurrection]] led by [[Emilio Aguinaldo]].

Roosevelt continued the McKinley policies of removing the Catholic friars (with compensation to the [[Pope]]), upgrading the infrastructure, introducing public health programs, and launching a program of economic and social modernization. The enthusiasm shown in 1898-99 for colonies cooled off, and Roosevelt saw the islands as \"our heel of Achilles.\" He told Taft in 1907, \"I should be glad to see the islands made independent, with perhaps some kind of international guarantee for the preservation of order, or with some warning on our part that if they did not keep order we would have to interfere again.\"<ref>H.

The island provided an ideal naval base for defense of the Panama Canal, and it also served as an economic and political link to the rest of Latin America. Prevailing racist attitudes made Puerto Rican statehood unlikely, so the U.S. carved out a new political status for the island. The Foraker Act and [[Insular Cases|subsequent Supreme Court cases]] established Puerto Rico as the first [[Unincorporated territories of the United States|unincorporated territory]], meaning that the United States Constitution would not fully apply to Puerto Rico. Though the U.S. imposed tariffs on most Puerto Rican imports, it also invested in the island's infrastructure and education system. Nationalist sentiment remained strong on the island and Puerto Ricans continued to primarily speak Spanish rather than English.<ref>Herring, pp. 364-365</ref>\n\n===Military reforms===\n[[Image:BigStick.jpg|thumb|300px|1904 commentary on Roosevelt's \"big stick\" policy in the Caribbean]]\n\nRoosevelt placed an emphasis on expanding and reforming the United States military.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=117\u2013119}} The [[United States Army]], with 39,000 men in 1890, was the smallest and least powerful army of any major power in the late 19th century.

Overcoming opposition from General [[Nelson A. Miles]], the [[Commanding General of the United States Army]], Root succeeded in enlarging [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] and establishing the [[U.S. Army War College]] as well as the general staff. Root also changed the procedures for promotions, organized schools for the special branches of the service, devised the principle of rotating officers from staff to line,<ref>James E.

With the British acceptance of the Monroe Doctrine and American acceptance of the British control of [[Canada]], only two potential major issues remained between the U.S. and Britain: the [[Alaska boundary dispute]] and construction of a canal across [[Central America]]. Under McKinley, Secretary of State Hay had negotiated the [[Hay\u2013Pauncefote Treaty]], in which the British consented to U.S. construction of the canal. Roosevelt won Senate ratification of the treaty in December 1901.<ref name=morris2526>Morris (2001) pp 25\u201326</ref>\n\nThe boundary between [[Alaska]] and Canada had become an issue in the late 1890s due to the [[Klondike Gold Rush]], as American and Canadian prospectors in [[Yukon]] and Alaska competed for gold claims. A treaty on the border between Alaska and Canada had been reached by Britain and Russia in the 1825 [[Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1825)|Treaty of Saint Petersburg]], and the United States had assumed Russian claims on the region through the 1867 [[Alaska Purchase]]. The United States argued that the treaty had given Alaska sovereignty over disputed territories which included the gold rush boom towns of [[Dyea, Alaska|Dyea]] and [[Skagway, Alaska|Skagway]].{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=77\u201378}} The [[Venezuelan crisis of 1902\u201303|Venezuela Crisis]] briefly threatened to disrupt peaceful negotiations over the border, but conciliatory actions by the British during the crisis helped defuse any possibility of broader hostilities.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=78\u201379}} In January 1903, the U.S. and Britain reached the Hay\u2013Herbert Treaty, which would empower a six-member tribunal, composed of American, British, and Canadian delegates, to set the border between Alaska and Canada. With the help of Senator [[Henry Cabot Lodge]], Roosevelt won the Senate's consent to the Hay\u2013Herbert Treaty in February 1903.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=79\u201380}} The tribunal consisted of three American delegates, two Canadian delegates, and [[Richard Webster, 1st Viscount Alverstone|Lord Alverstone]], the lone delegate from Britain itself. Alverstone joined with the three American delegates in accepting most American claims, and the tribunal announced its decision in October 1903. The outcome of the tribunal strengthened relations between the United States and Britain, though many Canadians were outraged by the tribunal's decision.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=80\u201381}}\n\n===Venezuela Crisis and Roosevelt Corollary===\nIn December 1902, an Anglo-German [[blockade]] of [[Venezuela]] began an incident known as the [[Venezuelan crisis of 1902\u201303|Venezuelan Crisis]]. The blockade originated due to money owed by Venezuela to European creditors. Both powers assured the U.S. that they were not interested in conquering Venezuela, and Roosevelt sympathized with the European creditors, but he became suspicious that Germany would demand territorial indemnification from Venezuela. Roosevelt and Hay feared that even an allegedly temporary occupation could lead to a permanent German military presence in the Western Hemisphere.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=72\u201373}} As the blockade began, Roosevelt mobilized the U.S. fleet under the command of Admiral [[George Dewey]].<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 176\u2013182</ref> Roosevelt threatened to destroy the German fleet unless the Germans agreed to arbitration regarding the Venezuelan debt, and Germany chose arbitration rather than war.<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 187\u2013191</ref> Through American arbitration, Venezuela reached a settlement with Germany and Britain in February 1903.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=75\u201376}}\n[[File:Tr-bigstick-cartoon.JPG|thumb|TR used his navy to dominate the Caribbean; 1904 cartoon by [[William Allen Rogers]]]]\nThough Roosevelt would not tolerate European territorial ambitions in Latin America, he also believed that Latin American countries should pay the debts they owed to European credits.<ref>Morris (2001) p. 201</ref> In late 1904, Roosevelt announced his [[Roosevelt Corollary]] to the Monroe Doctrine. It stated that the U.S. would intervene in the finances of unstable Caribbean and Central American countries if they defaulted on their debts to European creditors and, in effect, guarantee their debts, making it unnecessary for European powers to intervene to collect unpaid debts. Roosevelt's pronouncement was especially meant as a warning to Germany, and had the result of promoting peace in the region, as the Germans decided to not intervene directly in Venezuela and in other countries.<ref>Frederick W. Marks III, ''Velvet on Iron: The Diplomacy of Theodore Roosevelt'' (1979), p. 140</ref>\n\nA crisis in the [[Dominican Republic]] became the first test case for the Roosevelt Corollary. Deeply in debt, the nation struggled to repay its European creditors. Fearing another intervention by Germany and Britain, Roosevelt reached an agreement with Dominican President [[Carlos Felipe Morales]] to take temporary control of the Dominican economy, much as the U.S. had done on a permanent basis in Puerto Rico. The U.S. took control of the Dominican customs house, brought in economists such as [[Jacob Hollander]] to restructure the economy, and ensured a steady flow of revenue to the Dominican Republic's foreign creditors. The intervention stabilized the political and economic situation in the Dominican Republic, and the U.S. role on the island would serve as a model for Taft's [[dollar diplomacy]] in the years after Roosevelt left office.<ref>Herring, pp. 371\u2013372</ref>\n\n===Panama Canal===\n{{Further|History of the Panama Canal}}\n[[File:Panama Canal under construction, 1907.jpg|thumb|upright=.95|Roosevelt regarded the [[Panama Canal]] as one of his greatest achievements]]\n[[File:TR-panama-canal.jpg|thumb|upright=.95|Roosevelt at the controls of a steam shovel excavating Culebra Cut for the Panama Canal, 1906]]\n\nRoosevelt sought the creation of a canal through Central America which would link the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Most members of Congress preferred that the canal cross through [[Nicaragua]], which was eager to reach an agreement, but Roosevelt preferred the [[isthmus of Panama]], under the loose control of [[Colombia]]. Colombia had been engulfed in a [[Thousand Days' War|civil war]] since 1898, and a previous attempt to build a canal across Panama had failed under the leadership of [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]].

The agreement banned emigration of Japanese laborers to the U.S. and Hawaii, while also ending the segregation order of the San Francisco School Board, which had humiliated and angered the Japanese. The agreements remained in effect until the passage of the [[Immigration Act of 1924]], in which Congress forbade all immigration from Japan.<ref>Carl R.

After signing the [[Entente Cordiale]] with Britain, France had sought to assert its dominance over [[Morocco]], and a crisis had begun after Germany protested this move. By asking Roosevelt to convene an international conference on Morocco, Kaiser Wilhelm II sought to test the new Anglo-British alliance, check French expansion, and potentially draw the United States into an alliance against France and Britain.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=182\u2013184}} Senator [[Augustus Octavius Bacon]] protested U.S. involvement in European affairs, but Secretary of State Root and administration allies like Senator Lodge helped defeat Bacon's resolution condemning U.S. participation in the Algeciras Conference.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|p=185}} The conference was held in the city of [[Algeciras]], Spain, and 13 nations attended. The key issue was control of the police forces in the Moroccan cities, and Germany, with a weak diplomatic delegation, found itself in a decided minority. Hoping to avoid an expansion of German power in [[North Africa]], Roosevelt secretly supported France, and he cooperated closely with the French ambassador. An agreement among the powers, reached on April 7, 1906, slightly reduced French influence by reaffirming the independence of the Sultan of Morocco and the economic independence and freedom of operations of all European powers within the country.

Fairbanks]], failed to galvanize support for their candidacies.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=122\u2013123}} At the [[1904 Republican National Convention]], Roosevelt secured his own nomination, but his preferred vice-presidential running mate, [[Robert R.

Parker]], the chief judge of the [[New York Court of Appeals]]. Democratic leaders hoped that Parker, whose political positions were largely unknown, would be able unify the populist followers of [[William Jennings Bryan]] with the conservative supporters of former President [[Grover Cleveland]]. Parker was unable to unite the party, and many Democrats supported Roosevelt.<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 339\u2013340</ref> Democrats alleged that the Republican campaign extorted large contributions from corporations, but these allegations had little impact on the election.{{Sfn|Chambers|1974|pp=215\u2013217}} As Parker moved his party in a conservative direction, Republicans performed well among progressives and centrists.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=135\u2013136}} Roosevelt won 56% of the popular vote while Parker received 38% of the popular; Roosevelt also won the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral vote]] 336 to 140. Roosevelt's victory made him first president to be elected to a full term of his own after having succeeded to the presidency upon the death of a predecessor. His [[List of United States presidential elections by popular vote margin|popular vote margin]] of 18.8% was the largest margin in U.S. history until the [[1920 United States presidential election|1920 presidential election]].{{Sfn|Brands|1997|pp=513\u201314}} On election night, as it became clear that he had won in a landslide, Roosevelt pledged not to run for a third term.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=139\u2013140}}\n\n===Election of 1908 and transition===\n{{Main|1908 United States presidential election}}\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1908.svg|thumb|right|Republican William Howard Taft defeated Democrat William Jennings Bryan in the 1908 election]]\n\nRoosevelt had mixed feelings about a third term, as he enjoyed being president and was still relatively youthful, but felt that a limited number of terms provided a check against dictatorship. Roosevelt ultimately decided to stick to his 1904 pledge not to run for a third term, and he threw his support behind a successor so as to avoid a potential pro-Roosevelt delegate stampede at the [[1908 Republican National Convention]]. Roosevelt personally favored Secretary of State Elihu Root, but Root's ill health made him an unsuitable candidate. New York Governor [[Charles Evans Hughes]] loomed as a potentially strong candidate and shared Roosevelt's progressivism, but Roosevelt disliked him and considered him to be too independent. Instead, Roosevelt settled on his Secretary of War, [[William Howard Taft]], who had ably served under Presidents Harrison, McKinley, and Roosevelt in various positions. Roosevelt and Taft had been friends since 1890, and Taft had consistently supported President Roosevelt's policies.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=483\u2013485}} Many conservatives wanted to re-take leadership of the party from the progressive Roosevelt.{{Sfn|Gould|2003|pp = 163\u2013164}} Senator Joseph Foraker, who like Taft was from Ohio, briefly emerged as the main conservative candidate for the GOP nomination.<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 506\u2013507</ref> However, Taft defeated Foraker's attempt to win control of the Ohio Republican Party and entered the convention as the strong favorite over Foraker, Hughes, and Senator Philander Knox.<ref>Morris (2001) p. 520</ref>\n\nAt the 1908 Republican convention, many chanted for \"four years more\" of a Roosevelt presidency, but Taft won the nomination after Roosevelt's close friend, Henry Cabot Lodge, made it clear that Roosevelt was not interested in a third term.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=488\u2013489}} In a speech accepting the Republican nomination, Taft promised to continue the policies of Roosevelt, but as the campaign progressed he minimized his reliance on Roosevelt, and did not ask the president to publicly campaign for him.<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 533-536</ref> The Democrats nominated William Jennings Bryan, who had been the party's presidential candidate in 1896 and 1900. Bryan, a populist Democrat widely regarded as a strong speaker, thought that Taft was a weak candidate and hoped that the public would tire of the Republican leadership the country had experienced since the [[1896 United States presidential election|1896 election]].<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 528\u2013529</ref> The platforms of the two parties differed little: both called for antitrust actions, railroad and labor regulations, and a revision of the tariff.<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 534\u2013535</ref> As election day approached, it became clear that Taft would retain the loyalty of Republican voters and win a wide victory over Bryan, who had failed to find a winning issue on which to campaign. Taft won 321 of the 483 electoral votes and 51.6% of the popular vote. Republicans also retained control of both houses of Congress. Roosevelt regarded the victory of his chosen successor as a vindication of his policies and presidency.<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 537\u2013539</ref> As he left office, Roosevelt was widely regarded as the most powerful and influential president since [[Abraham Lincoln]].<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 554\u2013555</ref> Taft's decision to retain few members of Roosevelt's Cabinet alienated Roosevelt, although Roosevelt continued to support his successor throughout the transition period.<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 548\u2013552</ref>\n\n==Historical reputation==\n[[File:1914 - Theodore Roosevelt in Center Square.jpg|thumb|Roosevelt in Pennsylvania on 26 October 1914]]\n\nRoosevelt was popular as he left office, and he remained a major world figure until his death in 1919. His own contemporaries viewed his presidency as influential; former Senator [[William E. Chandler]] wrote in January 1909 that Roosevelt \"changed the course of American politics. We can never go back to where we were under [[Mark Hanna|Hanna]].\"{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=292\u2013293}} After his death, Roosevelt was overshadowed by other figures, but the interest of historians and the American public in Roosevelt was reinvigorated after [[World War II]]. Historian [[John Morton Blum]]'s 1954 book, ''The Republican Roosevelt'', advanced the thesis that Roosevelt had been the first truly modern president, and many historians have argued that Roosevelt's presidency served as a model to subsequent presidents.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=293\u2013294}}\n\nHistorian Lewis L. Gould summarizes the consensus view of historians, stating that Roosevelt was \"a strong, effective executive whose policies foreshadowed the [[welfare state]].\"{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=293\u2013294}} Gould also writes, \"if Roosevelt fell short of the first rank of president, he qualified for that ambivalent rating of 'near great,' conferred upon him in the [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States|polls that historians take with each other]].{{Sfn|Gould|2011|p=295}} A 2018 poll of the [[American Political Science Association]] ranked Roosevelt as the fourth greatest president in history, after [[George Washington]], [[Abraham Lincoln]], and [[Franklin D.

Roosevelt had been the [[Vice President of the United States]] for only {{age in days|Mar 4, 1901|Sep 14, 1901}} days when he succeeded to the presidency. A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], he ran for and won by a landslide a four-year term as president in [[1904 United States presidential election|1904]]. He was succeeded by his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and chosen successor, [[William Howard Taft]].\n\nA [[Progressive Era|Progressive]] reformer, Roosevelt earned a reputation as a \"trust buster\" through his regulatory reforms and [[United States antitrust law|antitrust prosecutions]]. His presidency saw the passage of the [[Pure Food and Drug Act]], which established the [[Food and Drug Administration]] to regulate food safety, and the [[Hepburn Act]], which increased the regulatory power of the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]]. Roosevelt took care, however, to show that he did not disagree with [[Trust (business)|trusts]] and [[capitalism]] in principle, but was only against [[Monopoly|monopolistic]] practices. His \"[[Square Deal]]\" included regulation of railroad rates and pure foods and drugs; he saw it as a fair deal for both the average citizen and the businessmen. Sympathetic to both business and labor, Roosevelt avoided labor strife, most notably negotiating a settlement to the great [[Coal Strike of 1902]]. He vigorously promoted the [[Conservation movement#United States|conservation movement]], emphasizing efficient use of natural resources. He dramatically expanded the system of [[national park]]s and [[United States National Forest|national forests]]. After 1906, he moved to the [[left-wing politics|left]], attacking big business, proposing a welfare state, and supporting labor unions.\n\nIn foreign affairs, Roosevelt sought to uphold the [[Monroe Doctrine]] and to establish the United States as a strong naval power and took charge of building the [[Panama Canal]], which greatly increased access to the Pacific and increased American security interests and trade opportunities. He inherited the [[Territories of the United States|colonial empire]] acquired in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] (1898). He ended the [[United States Military Government in Cuba]] and committed to a long-term occupation of [[Insular Government of the Philippine Islands|the Philippines]]. Much of his foreign policy focused on the threats posed by Japan in the Pacific and Germany in the [[Caribbean Sea]]. Seeking to minimize European power in Latin America, he mediated the [[Venezuelan crisis of 1902\u201303|Venezuela Crisis]] and declared the [[Roosevelt Corollary]]. Roosevelt mediated the [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904-1905), for which he won the [[List of Nobel Peace Prize laureates|1906 Nobel Peace Prize]]. He pursued closer relations with Great Britain.  Biographer William Harbaugh argues:\n:In foreign affairs, Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s legacy is judicious support of the national interest and promotion of world stability through the maintenance of a balance of power; creation or strengthening of international agencies, and resort to their use when practicable ; and implicit resolve to use military force, if feasible, to foster legitimate American interests. In domestic affairs, it is the use of government to advance the public interest. \u201cIf on this new continent,\u201d he said, \u201cwe merely build another country of great but unjustly divided material prosperity, we shall have done nothing.\u201d<ref>William H.

[[Progressivism in the United States|Progressivism]] was among the most powerful political forces of the day, and Roosevelt was its most articulate spokesperson. Progressivism had dual aspects. First, progressivism promoted use of science, engineering, technology, and social sciences to address the nation's problems, and identify ways to eliminate waste and inefficiency and promote modernization.<ref>see George Mowry, ''The Era of Theodore Roosevelt and the Birth of Modern America, 1900\u20131912'' (1954), ch. 1</ref> Those promoting progressivism also campaigned against corruption among political machines, labor unions, and trusts of new, large corporations, which emerged at the turn of the century.<ref>see Lewis L. Gould, ''The Presidency of Theodore Roosevelt.'' (1991), ch 1</ref> In describing Roosevelt's priorities and characteristics as president, historian G. Warren Chessman noted Roosevelt's {{Quote|insistence upon the public responsibility of large corporations; publicity as a first remedy for trusts; regulation of railroad rates; mediation of the conflict of capital and labor; conservation of natural resources; and protection of the less fortunate members of society.<ref>Chessman, p 6</ref>}}\n\n===Trust busting and regulation===\n{{see also|History of United States antitrust law}}\n\nIn the late-nineteenth century, several large businesses, including [[Standard Oil]], had either bought their rivals or had established business arrangements that effectively stifled competition. Many companies followed the model of Standard Oil, which organized itself as a [[trust (business)|trust]] in which several component corporations were controlled by one [[board of director]]s. While Congress had passed the 1890 [[Sherman Antitrust Act]] to provide some federal regulation of trusts, the Supreme Court had limited the power of the act in the case of ''[[United States v. E. C. Knight Co.]]''.<ref>Morris (2001) pp 27\u201330</ref> By 1902, the 100 largest corporations held control of 40 percent of industrial capital in the United States. Roosevelt did not oppose all trusts, but sought to regulate trusts that he believed harmed the public, which he labeled as \"bad trusts.\"{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=26\u201327}}\n\n====First term====\nUpon taking office, Roosevelt proposed federal regulations of trusts. As the states had not prevented the growth of what he viewed as harmful trusts, Roosevelt advocated the creation of Cabinet department designed to regulate corporations engaged in [[interstate commerce]].{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=27\u201328, 31\u201332}} He also favored amending the [[Interstate Commerce Act of 1887]], which had failed to prevent the consolidation of railroads.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=37\u201338}} In February 1902, the Justice Department announced that it would file an antitrust suit against the [[Northern Securities Company]], a railroad [[holding company]] that had been formed in 1901 by [[J. P. Morgan]], [[James J. Hill]], and [[E. H. Harriman]].{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=45\u201347}} As the Justice Department lacked an antitrust division, Attorney General Knox, a former corporate lawyer, personally led the suit. While the case was working its way through court, Knox filed another case against the \"Beef Trust,\" which had become unpopular due to rising meat prices.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=49\u201350}} Combined with his earlier rhetoric, the suits signaled Roosevelt's resolve to strengthen the federal regulation of trusts.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=45\u201347}}\n\nAfter the 1902 elections, Roosevelt called for a ban on railroad rebates to large industrial concerns, as well as for the creation of a [[Bureau of Corporations]] to study and report on monopolistic practices.<ref>Morris (2001) p. 195\u2013196</ref> To pass his antitrust package through Congress, Roosevelt appealed directly to the people, casting the legislation as a blow against the malevolent power of Standard Oil. Roosevelt's campaign proved successful, and he won congressional approval of the creation of the [[United States Department of Commerce and Labor|Department of Commerce and Labor]], which included the [[Bureau of Corporations]].<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 205\u2013208</ref> The Bureau of Corporations was designed to monitor and report on anti-competitive practices; Roosevelt believed that large companies would be less likely to engage in anti-competitive practices if such practices were publicized. At Knox's request, Congress also authorized the creation of the [[United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division|Antitrust Division]] of the Department of Justice. Roosevelt also won passage of the [[Elkins Act]], which restricted the granting of railroad rebates.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=101\u2013102}}\n\nIn March 1904, the Supreme Court ruled for the government in the case of ''[[Northern Securities Co. v. United States]]''. According to historian [[Michael McGerr]], the case represented the federal government's first victorious prosecution of a \"single, tightly integrated interstate corporation.\"<ref>McGerr (2003), p. 157</ref> The following year, the administration won another major victory in [[Swift and Company v. United States]], which broke up the Beef Trust. The evidence at trial demonstrated that, prior to 1902, the \"Big Six\" leading meatpackers had engaged in a conspiracy to fix prices and divide the market for livestock and meat in their quest for higher prices and higher profits. They blacklisted competitors who failed to go along, used false bids, and accepted rebates from the railroads. After they were hit with federal injunctions in 1902, the Big Six had merged into one company, allowing them to continue to control the trade internally. Speaking for the unanimous court, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. held that interstate commerce included actions that were part of the chain where the chain was clearly interstate in character. In this case, the chain ran from farm to retail store and crossed many state lines.<ref>\"The Supreme Court upholds Prosecution of the Beef Trust,\" in Frank N. Magill, ed., ''Great Events from History II: Business and Commerce Series Volume 1 1897-1923'' (1994) pp 107-111</ref>\n\n====Second term====\nFollowing his re-election, Roosevelt sought to quickly enact a bold legislative agenda, focusing especially on legislation that would build upon the regulatory accomplishments of his first term. Events during his first term had convinced Roosevelt that legislation enacting additional federal regulation of interstate commerce was necessary, as  the states were incapable of regulating large trusts that operated across state lines and the overworked Department of Justice was unable to provide an adequate check on monopolistic practices through antitrust cases alone.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=145\u2013146}} Roused by reports in [[McClure's|McClure's Magazine]], many Americans joined Roosevelt in calling for an enhancement to the Elkins Act, which had done relatively little to restrict the granting of railroad rebates.<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 417\u2013419</ref> Roosevelt also sought to strengthen the powers of the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] (ICC), which had been created in 1887 to regulate railroads.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=145\u2013146}} Roosevelt's call for regulatory legislation, published in his 1905 message to Congress, encountered strong opposition from business interests and conservative congressmen.<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 422\u2013429</ref>\n\nWhen Congress reconvened in late 1905, Roosevelt asked Senator [[Jonathan P. Dolliver]] of Iowa to introduce a bill that would incorporate Roosevelt's railroad regulatory proposals, and set about mobilizing public and congressional support for the bill. The bill was also taken up in the House, where it became known as the Hepburn Bill, named after Congressman [[William Peters Hepburn]].<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 428\u2013433</ref> While the bill passed the House with relative ease, the Senate, dominated by conservative Republicans like [[Nelson Aldrich]], posed a greater challenge.<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 442\u2013443</ref> Seeking to defeat reform efforts, Aldrich arranged it so that Democrat [[Benjamin Tillman]], a Southern senator who Roosevelt despised, was left in charge of the bill.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=155\u2013156}} Because railroad regulation was widely popular, opponents of the Hepburn Bill focused on the role of courts in reviewing the ICC's rate-setting. Roosevelt and progressives wanted to limit judicial review to issues of procedural fairness, while conservatives favored [[Standard of review|\"broad review\"]] that would allow judges to determine whether the rates themselves were fair.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=155\u2013156}}\n\nAfter Roosevelt and Tillman were unable to assemble a bipartisan majority behind a bill that restricted judicial review, Roosevelt accepted an amendment written by Senator Allison that contained vague language allowing for court review of the ICC's rate-setting power.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=156\u2013157}} With the inclusion of the Allison amendment, the Senate passed the Hepburn Bill in a 71-to-3 vote.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=158\u2013159}} After both houses of Congress passed a uniform law, Roosevelt signed the [[Hepburn Act]] into law on June 29, 1906. In addition to rate-setting, the Hepburn Act also granted the ICC regulatory power over pipeline fees, storage contracts, and several other aspects of railroad operations.<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 445\u2013448</ref> Though some conservatives believed that the Allison amendment had granted broad review powers to the courts, a subsequent Supreme Court case limited judicial power to review the ICC's rate-setting powers.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=158\u2013159}}\n\nIn response to public clamor largely arising from the popularity of [[Upton Sinclair]]'s novel, ''[[The Jungle]]'', Roosevelt also pushed Congress to enact food safety regulations. Opposition to a meat inspection bill was strongest in the House, due to the presence of conservative Speaker of the House [[Joseph Gurney Cannon]] and allies of the meatpacking industry.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=160\u2013162}} Roosevelt and Cannon agreed to a compromise bill that became the [[Meat Inspection Act]] of 1906. Congress simultaneously passed the [[Pure Food and Drug Act]], which received strong support in both the House and the Senate.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=162\u2013163}} Collectively, the laws provided for the labeling of foods and drugs and the inspection of livestock, and mandated sanitary conditions at meatpacking plants.<ref>Blum (1954) pp 43\u201344</ref>\n\nSeeking to bolster antitrust regulations, Roosevelt and his allies introduced a bill to enhance the Sherman Act in 1908, but it was defeated in Congress.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=272\u2013274}} In the aftermath of a series of scandals involving major [[Insurance in the United States|insurance]] companies, Roosevelt sought to establish a National Bureau of Insurance to provide federal regulation, but this proposal was also defeated.<ref>McGerr (2003), pp. 172\u2013174</ref> Roosevelt continued to launch antitrust suits in his second term, and a suit against Standard Oil in 1906 would lead to that company's break-up in 1911.<ref>McGerr (2003), pp. 158\u2013159</ref> In addition to the antitrust suits and major regulatory reform efforts, the Roosevelt administration also won the cooperation of many large trusts, who consented to regulation by the Bureau of Corporations.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=204\u2013205}} Among the companies that voluntarily agreed to regulation was [[U.S. Steel]], which avoided an antitrust suit by allowing the Bureau of Corporations to investigate its operations.<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 477\u2013478</ref>\n\n===Conservation===\n[[Image:TR-Enviro.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.2|A political cartoon describing Roosevelt as \"a practical forester\"]]\n{{Further|List of lands nationalized by Theodore Roosevelt through executive action}}\n\nRoosevelt was a prominent [[conservation movement|conservationist]], putting the issue high on the national agenda.<ref>Benjamin Redekop, (2014). \"Embodying the Story: The Conservation Leadership of Theodore Roosevelt\" in ''Leadership'' DOI: 10.1177/1742715014546875.

Roosevelt increased Pinchot's power over environmental issues by transferring control over [[United States National Forest|national forests]] from the Department of the Interior to the Bureau of Forestry, which was part of the Agriculture Department. Pinchot's agency was renamed to the [[United States Forest Service]], and Pinchot presided over the implementation of assertive conservationist policies in national forests.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=191\u2013192}}\n\nRoosevelt encouraged the [[Newlands Reclamation Act]] of 1902, which promoted federal construction of dams to irrigate small farms and placed 230 million acres (360,000&nbsp;mi\u00b2 or 930,000&nbsp;km\u00b2) under federal protection. In 1906, Congress passed the [[Antiquities Act]], granting the president the power to create [[National monument (United States)|national monuments]] in federal lands. Roosevelt set aside more federal land, [[national park]]s, and [[nature preserve]]s than all of his predecessors combined.<ref name=benson>W. Todd Benson, ''President Theodore Roosevelt's Conservations Legacy'' (2003)</ref><ref>Douglas Brinkley, ''The Wilderness Warrior: Theodore Roosevelt and the Crusade for America'' (2010)</ref> Roosevelt established the [[Inland Waterways Commission]] to coordinate construction of water projects for both conservation and transportation purposes, and in 1908 he hosted the [[Conference of Governors]] to boost support for conservation.{{efn|The Conference of Governors was the first time in United States history that the governors of the various states assembled as a group.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=198\u2013199}}}} After the conference, Roosevelt established the [[National Conservation Commission]] to take an inventory of the nation's natural resources.<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 515-519</ref>\n\nRoosevelt's policies faced opposition from both environmental activists like [[John Muir]] and opponents of conservation like Senator [[Henry M. Teller]] of Colorado.<ref>McGerr (2003), pp. 166\u2013167</ref> While Muir, the founder of the [[Sierra Club]], wanted nature preserved for the sake of pure beauty, Roosevelt subscribed to Pinchot's formulation, \"to make the forest produce the largest amount of whatever crop or service will be most useful, and keep on producing it for generation after generation of men and trees.\" <ref>Gifford Pinchot, ''Breaking New Ground,'' (1947) p. 32.</ref> Teller and other opponents of conservation, meanwhile, believed that conservation would prevent the economic development of the West and feared the centralization of power in Washington. The backlash to Roosevelt's ambitious policies prevented further conservation efforts in the final years of Roosevelt's presidency and would later contribute to the [[Pinchot\u2013Ballinger controversy]] during the Taft administration.<ref>McGerr (2003), pp. 167\u2013169</ref>\n\n===Labor relations===\n{{see also|Labor history of the United States}}\n[[File:CoalBarons.JPG|thumb|\"The Washington Schoolmaster,\" An editorial cartoon about the Coal strike of 1902, by [[Charles Lederer (cartoonist)|Charles Lederer]]]]\n\nRoosevelt was generally reluctant to involve himself in labor-management disputes, but he believed that presidential intervention was justified when such disputes threatened the public interest.<ref>Morris (2001) p. 131</ref> Labor union membership had doubled in the five years preceding Roosevelt's inauguration, and at the time of his accession, Roosevelt saw labor unrest as the greatest potential threat facing the nation. Yet he also sympathized with many laborers due to the harsh conditions that many faced.<ref>Morris (2001) pp 31\u201332</ref> Resisting the more extensive reforms proposed by labor leaders such as [[Samuel Gompers]] of the [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL), Roosevelt established the [[open shop]] as the official policy civil service employees.<ref>Morris (2001) pp 271\u2013272</ref>\n\nIn 1899, the [[United Mine Workers]] (UMW) had expanded its influence from [[bituminous coal]] mines to [[anthracite]] coal mines. The UMW organized an [[Coal Strike of 1902|anthracite coal strike]] in May 1902, seeking an [[eight-hour day]] and pay increases. Hoping to reach a negotiated solution with the help of [[Mark Hanna]]'s [[National Civic Federation]], UMW president [[John Mitchell (United Mine Workers)|John Mitchell]] prevented bituminous coal miners from launching a [[Solidarity action|sympathy strike]]. The mine owners, who wanted to crush the UMW, refused to negotiate, and the strike continued. In the ensuing months, the price of coal increased from five dollars per ton to above fifteen dollars per ton. Seeking to help the two parties arrive at a solution, Roosevelt hosted the UMW leaders and mine operators at the White House in October 1902, but the mine owners refused to negotiate. Through the efforts of Roosevelt, Root, and J.P. Morgan, the mine operators agreed to the establishment of a presidential commission to propose a solution to the strike. In March 1903, the commission mandated pay increases and a reduction in the workday from ten hours to nine hours. At the insistence of the mine owners, the UMW was not granted official recognition as the representative of the miners.<ref>McGerr (2003), pp. 118\u2013125</ref>\n\nRoosevelt refrained from major interventions in labor disputes after 1902, but state and federal courts increasingly became involved, issuing [[injunction]]s to prevent labor actions.<ref>McGerr (2003), pp. 143\u2013144</ref> Tensions were particularly high in Colorado, where the [[Western Federation of Miners]] led a series of strikes that became part of a struggle known as the [[Colorado Labor Wars]]. Roosevelt did not intervene in the Colorado Labor Wars, but Governor [[James Hamilton Peabody]] dispatched the Colorado National Guard to crush the strikes. In 1905, radical union leaders like [[Mary Harris Jones]] and [[Eugene V. Debs]] established the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW), which criticized the conciliatory policies of the AFL.<ref>McGerr (2003), pp. 126, 138\u2013142</ref>\n\n===Civil rights===\nAlthough Roosevelt did some work improving [[race relations]], he, like most leaders of the [[Progressive Era]], lacked initiative on most racial issues.

Roosevelt was widely criticized by contemporary newspapers for the discharges, and Senator [[Joseph B. Foraker]] won passage of a congressional resolution directing the administration to turn over all documents related to the case.<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 471\u2013473</ref> The controversy hung over the remainder of his presidency, although the Senate eventually concluded that the dismissals had been justified.<ref>Morris (2001) p. 511</ref>\n\n===Panic of 1907===\n{{Further|Panic of 1907}}\n\nIn 1907, Roosevelt faced the greatest domestic economic crisis since the [[Panic of 1893]]. The U.S. [[stock market]] entered a slump in early 1907, and many in the financial markets blamed Roosevelt's regulatory policies for the decline in stock prices.<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 495\u2013496</ref> Lacking a strong [[History of central banking in the United States|central banking system]], the government was unable to coordinate a response to the economic downturn.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=112\u2013113}} The slump reached a full-blown panic in October 1907, when two investors failed to take over [[United Copper]]. Working with Secretary of the Treasury Cortelyou, financier J.P. Morgan organized a group of businessmen to avert a crash by pledging their own money.

With the support of Roosevelt, Senator Aldrich introduced a bill to allow [[History of central banking in the United States#1863\u20131913: National Banks|National Banks]] to issue emergency currency, but his proposal was defeated by Democrats and progressive Republicans who believed that it was overly favorable to Wall Street.

France and Britain had agreed that  France would dominate Morocco, but Germany suddenly protested aggressively, with the disregard for quiet diplomacy characteristic of Kaiser Wilhelm. Berlin asked Roosevelt to serve as a intermediary, and he helped arrange a multinational conference at [[Algeciras Conference|Algeciras, Morocco]], where the crisis was resolved.

With the British acceptance of the Monroe Doctrine and American acceptance of the British control of [[Canada]], only two potential major issues remained between the U.S. and Britain: the [[Alaska boundary dispute]] and construction of a canal across [[Central America]]. Under McKinley, Secretary of State Hay had negotiated the [[Hay\u2013Pauncefote Treaty]], in which the British consented to U.S. construction of the canal.

A treaty on the border between Alaska and Canada had been reached by Britain and Russia in the 1825 [[Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1825)|Treaty of Saint Petersburg]], and the United States had assumed Russian claims on the region through the 1867 [[Alaska Purchase]]. The United States argued that the treaty had given Alaska sovereignty over disputed territories which included the gold rush boom towns of [[Dyea, Alaska|Dyea]] and [[Skagway, Alaska|Skagway]].{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=77\u201378}} The [[Venezuelan crisis of 1902\u201303|Venezuela Crisis]] briefly threatened to disrupt peaceful negotiations over the border, but conciliatory actions by the British during the crisis helped defuse any possibility of broader hostilities.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=78\u201379}} In January 1903, the U.S. and Britain reached the Hay\u2013Herbert Treaty, which would empower a six-member tribunal, composed of American, British, and Canadian delegates, to set the border between Alaska and Canada. With the help of Senator [[Henry Cabot Lodge]], Roosevelt won the Senate's consent to the Hay\u2013Herbert Treaty in February 1903.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=79\u201380}} The tribunal consisted of three American delegates, two Canadian delegates, and [[Richard Webster, 1st Viscount Alverstone|Lord Alverstone]], the lone delegate from Britain itself. Alverstone joined with the three American delegates in accepting most American claims, and the tribunal announced its decision in October 1903. The outcome of the tribunal strengthened relations between the United States and Britain, though many Canadians were outraged by the tribunal's decision.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=80\u201381}}\n\n===Venezuela Crisis and Roosevelt Corollary===\nIn December 1902, an Anglo-German [[blockade]] of [[Venezuela]] began an incident known as the [[Venezuelan crisis of 1902\u201303|Venezuelan Crisis]]. The blockade originated due to money owed by Venezuela to European creditors. Both powers assured the U.S. that they were not interested in conquering Venezuela, and Roosevelt sympathized with the European creditors, but he became suspicious that Germany would demand territorial indemnification from Venezuela. Roosevelt and Hay feared that even an allegedly temporary occupation could lead to a permanent German military presence in the Western Hemisphere.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=72\u201373}} As the blockade began, Roosevelt mobilized the U.S. fleet under the command of Admiral [[George Dewey]].<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 176\u2013182</ref> Roosevelt threatened to destroy the German fleet unless the Germans agreed to arbitration regarding the Venezuelan debt, and Germany chose arbitration rather than war.<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 187\u2013191</ref> Through American arbitration, Venezuela reached a settlement with Germany and Britain in February 1903.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=75\u201376}}\n[[File:Tr-bigstick-cartoon.JPG|thumb|TR used his navy to dominate the Caribbean; 1904 cartoon by [[William Allen Rogers]]]]\nThough Roosevelt would not tolerate European territorial ambitions in Latin America, he also believed that Latin American countries should pay the debts they owed to European credits.<ref>Morris (2001) p. 201</ref> In late 1904, Roosevelt announced his [[Roosevelt Corollary]] to the Monroe Doctrine. It stated that the U.S. would intervene in the finances of unstable Caribbean and Central American countries if they defaulted on their debts to European creditors and, in effect, guarantee their debts, making it unnecessary for European powers to intervene to collect unpaid debts. Roosevelt's pronouncement was especially meant as a warning to Germany, and had the result of promoting peace in the region, as the Germans decided to not intervene directly in Venezuela and in other countries.<ref>Frederick W. Marks III, ''Velvet on Iron: The Diplomacy of Theodore Roosevelt'' (1979), p. 140</ref>\n\nA crisis in the [[Dominican Republic]] became the first test case for the Roosevelt Corollary. Deeply in debt, the nation struggled to repay its European creditors. Fearing another intervention by Germany and Britain, Roosevelt reached an agreement with Dominican President [[Carlos Felipe Morales]] to take temporary control of the Dominican economy, much as the U.S. had done on a permanent basis in Puerto Rico.

Most members of Congress preferred that the canal cross through [[Nicaragua]], which was eager to reach an agreement, but Roosevelt preferred the [[isthmus of Panama]], under the loose control of [[Colombia]]. Colombia had been engulfed in a [[Thousand Days' War|civil war]] since 1898, and a previous attempt to build a canal across Panama had failed under the leadership of [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]]. A presidential commission appointed by McKinley had recommended the construction of the canal across Nicaragua, but it noted that a canal across Panama could prove less expensive and might be completed more quickly.<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 26, 67\u201368</ref> Roosevelt and most of his advisers favored the Panama Canal, as they believed that war with a European power, possibly Germany, could soon break out over the Monroe Doctrine and the U.S. fleet would remain divided between the two oceans until the canal was completed.<ref name=\"Morris 2001 pp. 201\u2013202\">Morris (2001) pp. 201\u2013202</ref> After a long debate, Congress passed the [[Spooner Act]] of 1902, which granted Roosevelt $170 million to build the [[Panama Canal]].<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 115\u2013116</ref> Following the passage of the Spooner Act, the Roosevelt administration began negotiations with the Colombian government regarding the construction of a canal through Panama.<ref name=\"Morris 2001 pp. 201\u2013202\"/>\n\nThe U.S. and Colombia signed the [[Hay\u2013Herr\u00e1n Treaty]] in January 1903, granting the U.S. a lease across the isthmus of Panama.<ref name=\"Morris 2001 pp. 201\u2013202\"/> The Colombian Senate refused to ratify the treaty, and attached amendments calling for more money from the U.S. and greater Colombian control over the canal zone.<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 262\u2013263</ref> Panamanian rebel leaders, long eager to break off from Colombia, appealed to the United States for military aid.<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 276\u2013278</ref> Roosevelt saw the leader of Columbia, [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Marroqu\u00edn]], as a corrupt and irresponsible autocrat, and he believed that the Colombians had acted in bad faith by reaching and then rejecting the treaty.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=85\u201389}} After an insurrection broke out in Panama, Roosevelt dispatched the [[USS Nashville (PG-7)|USS Nashville]] to prevent the Colombian government from landing soldiers in Panama, and Colombia was unable to re-establish control over the province.<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 282\u2013283</ref> Shortly after Panama [[Separation of Panama from Colombia|declared its independence]] in November 1903, the U.S. recognized Panama as an independent nation and began negotiations regarding construction of the canal. According to Roosevelt biographer Edmund Morris, most other Latin American nations welcomed the prospect of the new canal in hopes of increased economic activity, but [[anti-imperialism|anti-imperialists]] in the U.S. raged against Roosevelt's aid to the Panamanian separatists.<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 293\u2013298</ref>\n\nSecretary of State Hay and French diplomat [[Philippe-Jean Bunau-Varilla]], who represented the Panamanian government, quickly negotiated the [[Hay\u2013Bunau-Varilla Treaty]].

Russia agreed to withdrawal its forces in 1902, but it reneged on this promise and sought to expand its influence in Manchuria to the detriment of the other powers.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=82\u201384}} Roosevelt was unwilling to consider using the military to intervene in the far-flung region, but Japan prepared for war against Russia in order to remove it from Manchuria.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=84\u201385}} When the [[Russo-Japanese War]] broke out in February 1904, Roosevelt sympathized with the Japanese but sought to act as a mediator in the conflict. He hoped to uphold the Open Door policy in China and prevent either country from emerging as the dominant power in East Asia.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=173\u2013174}} Throughout 1904, both Japan and Russia expected to win the war, but the Japanese gained a decisive advantage after [[Siege of Port Arthur|capturing]] the Russian naval base at [[L\u00fcshunkou District|Port Arthur]] in January 1905.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=173\u2013176}} In mid-1905, Roosevelt persuaded the parties to meet in a peace conference in [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]], starting on August 5. His persistent and effective mediation led to the signing of the [[Treaty of Portsmouth]] on September 5, ending the war. For his efforts, Roosevelt was awarded the 1906 [[Nobel Peace Prize]].<ref>Greg Russell, \"Theodore Roosevelt's Diplomacy and the Quest for Great Power Equilibrium in Asia,\" ''Presidential Studies Quarterly'' 2008 38(3): 433-455</ref> The Treaty of Portsmouth resulted in the removal of Russian troops from Manchuria, and it gave Japan control of [[Korea]] and the southern half of [[Sakhalin Island]].{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=180\u2013182}}\n\n====Relations with Japan====\nRoosevelt saw Japan as the rising power in Asia, in terms of military strength and economic modernization. He viewed [[Korea]] as a backward nation and did not object to Japan's attempt to gain control over Korea. With the withdrawal of the American legation from [[Seoul]] and the refusal of the Secretary of State to receive a Korean protest mission, the Americans signaled they would not intervene militarily to stop Japan's planned takeover of Korea.<ref>Howard K. Beale, ''Theodore Roosevelt and the Rise of America to World Power'' (1956)</ref> In mid-1905, Taft and Japanese Prime Minister [[Katsura Tar\u014d]] jointly produced the [[Taft\u2013Katsura agreement]]. During the discussion, Japan stated that it had no interest in the Philippines, while the U.S. stated that it considered Korea to be part of the Japanese sphere of influence.<ref>Raymond A. Esthus, \"The Taft-Katsura Agreement - Reality or Myth?\" ''Journal of Modern History'' 1959 31(1): 46\u201351 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1871772  in JSTOR].</ref>\n\nVituperative anti-Japanese sentiment among Americans, especially on the West Coast, soured relations during the latter half of Roosevelt's term.<ref>Raymond Leslie Buell, \"The Development of the Anti-Japanese Agitation in the United States,\" ''Political Science Quarterly'' (1922) 37#4 pp. 605\u2013638 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2142459 part 1 in JSTOR] and Buell, \"The Development of Anti-Japanese Agitation in the United States II,\" ''Political Science Quarterly'' (1923) 38#1  pp. 57\u201381 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2142539 Part 2 in JSTOR]</ref> In 1906, the [[San Francisco]] Board of Education caused a diplomatic incident by ordering the segregation of all schoolchildren in the city.<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 482\u2013483</ref> The Roosevelt administration did not want to anger Japan by passing legislation to bar Japanese immigration to the U.S., as had previously been done for Chinese immigration. Instead, the two countries, led by Secretary of State Elihu Root and Japanese Foreign Minister [[Hayashi Tadasu]], reached the informal [[Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907]]. The agreement banned emigration of Japanese laborers to the U.S. and Hawaii, while also ending the segregation order of the San Francisco School Board, which had humiliated and angered the Japanese. The agreements remained in effect until the passage of the [[Immigration Act of 1924]], in which Congress forbade all immigration from Japan.<ref>Carl R.

Whitney Griswold, ''The Far Eastern Policy of the United States'' (1938). pp 354\u201360, 372\u201379</ref> Despite the agreement, tensions with Japan would continue to simmer due to the treatment of Japanese immigrants by local governments in the United States. Roosevelt never feared imminent war with the Japanese during his tenure, but the friction with Japan encouraged further naval build-up and an increased focus on the security of the American position in the Pacific.<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 493\u2013494</ref>\n\n===Algeciras Conference===\nIn 1906, at the request of Kaiser Wilhelm II, Roosevelt convinced [[French Third Republic|France]] to attend the [[Algeciras Conference]] as part of an effort to resolve the [[First Moroccan Crisis]]. After signing the [[Entente Cordiale]] with Britain, France had sought to assert its dominance over [[Morocco]], and a crisis had begun after Germany protested this move. By asking Roosevelt to convene an international conference on Morocco, Kaiser Wilhelm II sought to test the new Anglo-British alliance, check French expansion, and potentially draw the United States into an alliance against France and Britain.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=182\u2013184}} Senator [[Augustus Octavius Bacon]] protested U.S. involvement in European affairs, but Secretary of State Root and administration allies like Senator Lodge helped defeat Bacon's resolution condemning U.S. participation in the Algeciras Conference.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|p=185}} The conference was held in the city of [[Algeciras]], Spain, and 13 nations attended. The key issue was control of the police forces in the Moroccan cities, and Germany, with a weak diplomatic delegation, found itself in a decided minority. Hoping to avoid an expansion of German power in [[North Africa]], Roosevelt secretly supported France, and he cooperated closely with the French ambassador. An agreement among the powers, reached on April 7, 1906, slightly reduced French influence by reaffirming the independence of the Sultan of Morocco and the economic independence and freedom of operations of all European powers within the country. Germany gained nothing of importance but was mollified and stopped threatening war.<ref>Raymond A.

Fairbanks]], failed to galvanize support for their candidacies.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=122\u2013123}} At the [[1904 Republican National Convention]], Roosevelt secured his own nomination, but his preferred vice-presidential running mate, [[Robert R. Hitt]], was not nominated.{{Sfn|Brands|1997|p=504}} Senator Fairbanks, a favorite of conservatives, gained the vice-presidential nomination.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|p=437\u2013438}}\n\nThe Democratic Party's presidential nominee in 1904 was [[Alton B. Parker]], the chief judge of the [[New York Court of Appeals]]. Democratic leaders hoped that Parker, whose political positions were largely unknown, would be able unify the populist followers of [[William Jennings Bryan]] with the conservative supporters of former President [[Grover Cleveland]]. Parker was unable to unite the party, and many Democrats supported Roosevelt.<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 339\u2013340</ref> Democrats alleged that the Republican campaign extorted large contributions from corporations, but these allegations had little impact on the election.{{Sfn|Chambers|1974|pp=215\u2013217}} As Parker moved his party in a conservative direction, Republicans performed well among progressives and centrists.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=135\u2013136}} Roosevelt won 56% of the popular vote while Parker received 38% of the popular; Roosevelt also won the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral vote]] 336 to 140. Roosevelt's victory made him first president to be elected to a full term of his own after having succeeded to the presidency upon the death of a predecessor. His [[List of United States presidential elections by popular vote margin|popular vote margin]] of 18.8% was the largest margin in U.S. history until the [[1920 United States presidential election|1920 presidential election]].{{Sfn|Brands|1997|pp=513\u201314}} On election night, as it became clear that he had won in a landslide, Roosevelt pledged not to run for a third term.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=139\u2013140}}\n\n===Election of 1908 and transition===\n{{Main|1908 United States presidential election}}\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1908.svg|thumb|right|Republican William Howard Taft defeated Democrat William Jennings Bryan in the 1908 election]]\n\nRoosevelt had mixed feelings about a third term, as he enjoyed being president and was still relatively youthful, but felt that a limited number of terms provided a check against dictatorship. Roosevelt ultimately decided to stick to his 1904 pledge not to run for a third term, and he threw his support behind a successor so as to avoid a potential pro-Roosevelt delegate stampede at the [[1908 Republican National Convention]]. Roosevelt personally favored Secretary of State Elihu Root, but Root's ill health made him an unsuitable candidate. New York Governor [[Charles Evans Hughes]] loomed as a potentially strong candidate and shared Roosevelt's progressivism, but Roosevelt disliked him and considered him to be too independent. Instead, Roosevelt settled on his Secretary of War, [[William Howard Taft]], who had ably served under Presidents Harrison, McKinley, and Roosevelt in various positions. Roosevelt and Taft had been friends since 1890, and Taft had consistently supported President Roosevelt's policies.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=483\u2013485}} Many conservatives wanted to re-take leadership of the party from the progressive Roosevelt.{{Sfn|Gould|2003|pp = 163\u2013164}} Senator Joseph Foraker, who like Taft was from Ohio, briefly emerged as the main conservative candidate for the GOP nomination.<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 506\u2013507</ref> However, Taft defeated Foraker's attempt to win control of the Ohio Republican Party and entered the convention as the strong favorite over Foraker, Hughes, and Senator Philander Knox.<ref>Morris (2001) p. 520</ref>\n\nAt the 1908 Republican convention, many chanted for \"four years more\" of a Roosevelt presidency, but Taft won the nomination after Roosevelt's close friend, Henry Cabot Lodge, made it clear that Roosevelt was not interested in a third term.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=488\u2013489}} In a speech accepting the Republican nomination, Taft promised to continue the policies of Roosevelt, but as the campaign progressed he minimized his reliance on Roosevelt, and did not ask the president to publicly campaign for him.<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 533-536</ref> The Democrats nominated William Jennings Bryan, who had been the party's presidential candidate in 1896 and 1900. Bryan, a populist Democrat widely regarded as a strong speaker, thought that Taft was a weak candidate and hoped that the public would tire of the Republican leadership the country had experienced since the [[1896 United States presidential election|1896 election]].<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 528\u2013529</ref> The platforms of the two parties differed little: both called for antitrust actions, railroad and labor regulations, and a revision of the tariff.<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 534\u2013535</ref> As election day approached, it became clear that Taft would retain the loyalty of Republican voters and win a wide victory over Bryan, who had failed to find a winning issue on which to campaign. Taft won 321 of the 483 electoral votes and 51.6% of the popular vote. Republicans also retained control of both houses of Congress. Roosevelt regarded the victory of his chosen successor as a vindication of his policies and presidency.<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 537\u2013539</ref> As he left office, Roosevelt was widely regarded as the most powerful and influential president since [[Abraham Lincoln]].<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 554\u2013555</ref> Taft's decision to retain few members of Roosevelt's Cabinet alienated Roosevelt, although Roosevelt continued to support his successor throughout the transition period.<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 548\u2013552</ref>\n\n==Historical reputation==\n[[File:1914 - Theodore Roosevelt in Center Square.jpg|thumb|Roosevelt in Pennsylvania on 26 October 1914]]\n\nRoosevelt was popular as he left office, and he remained a major world figure until his death in 1919. His own contemporaries viewed his presidency as influential; former Senator [[William E. Chandler]] wrote in January 1909 that Roosevelt \"changed the course of American politics. We can never go back to where we were under [[Mark Hanna|Hanna]].\"{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=292\u2013293}} After his death, Roosevelt was overshadowed by other figures, but the interest of historians and the American public in Roosevelt was reinvigorated after [[World War II]]. Historian [[John Morton Blum]]'s 1954 book, ''The Republican Roosevelt'', advanced the thesis that Roosevelt had been the first truly modern president, and many historians have argued that Roosevelt's presidency served as a model to subsequent presidents.{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=293\u2013294}}\n\nHistorian Lewis L. Gould summarizes the consensus view of historians, stating that Roosevelt was \"a strong, effective executive whose policies foreshadowed the [[welfare state]].\"{{Sfn|Gould|2011|pp=293\u2013294}} Gould also writes, \"if Roosevelt fell short of the first rank of president, he qualified for that ambivalent rating of 'near great,' conferred upon him in the [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States|polls that historians take with each other]].{{Sfn|Gould|2011|p=295}} A 2018 poll of the [[American Political Science Association]] ranked Roosevelt as the fourth greatest president in history, after [[George Washington]], [[Abraham Lincoln]], and [[Franklin D.

The human brain develops many skills at an early age including [[social skills]], behavioral skills, and one's way of thinking. Learning how to interact with others and how to focus on certain subjects are essential lessons to learn at a young age. This starts from the time we can talk all the way to when we are so old that we can barely walk. However, there are some people in society who have difficulty with these kind of skills and behaving like an average person. This is most likely the cause of having a mental illness. A mental illness consist of a wide range of conditions that affects a person's mood, thinking, and behavior. About 26% of people in the United States, ages 18 and older, have been diagnosed with some kind of mental disorder. However, not much is said about children with mental illnesses even though there are many that will develop one, even as early as age three.\n\nThe most common mental illnesses in children include, but are not limited to [[anxiety disorder]], as well as [[Depression in childhood and adolescence|depression]] in older children and teens. Having a mental illness at a younger age is much different from having one in adulthood.

Parents are sometimes held responsible for their child's own illness.<ref name=\"Hinshaw, Stephen P 2005\"/> People also say that the parents raised their children in a certain way or they acquired their behavior from them. Family and friends are sometimes so ashamed of the idea of being close to someone with a disorder that the child feels isolated and thinks that they have to hide their illness from others.<ref name=\"Hinshaw, Stephen P 2005\"/> When in reality, hiding it from people prevents the child from getting the right amount of social interaction and treatment in order to thrive in today's society.\n\n[[Social stigma|Stigma]] is also a well-known factor in mental illness. Stigma is defined as \u201ca mark of disgrace associated with a particular circumstance, quality, or person.\u201d Stigma is used especially when it comes to the mentally disabled. People have this assumption that everyone with a mental problem, no matter how mild or severe, is automatically considered destructive or a criminal person. Thanks to the media, this idea has been planted in our brains from a young age.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wahl|first1=Otto F. |title=Depictions of Mental Illnesses in Children's Media |journal=[[Journal of Mental Health]] |volume=12 |issue=3 |date=June 2003 |pages=249\u201358 |doi=10.1080/0963823031000118230 }}</ref> Watching movies about teens with depression or children with Autism makes us think that all of the people that have a mental illness are like the ones on TV.

In an article written by Lisa Godman and her colleagues, they reference Smith\u2019s research on the prevance of PTSD among homeless people. His research stated \u201c Homelessness itself is a risk factor for emotional disorder\u201d. What this quote is saying is that being homeless itself can cause emotional disorder. Without looking for other reasons for emotional disorder and really looking at the simple fact that an individual is homeless can cause emotional disorder. Godman\u2019s article stated \u201cRecently, Smith ( 1991) investigated the prevalence of PTSD among a sample of 300 randomly selected homeless single women and mothers in St. Louis, Mis- souri. Using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS; Robins, 1981; Robins & Helzer, 1984), she found that 53% of the respondents could be diagnosed as exhibiting full-blown cases of PTSD\u201d. As the source explains, the conclusion that was drawn from Smith\u2019s investigation after studying 300 homeless individuals is that 53% of those people were eligible to be diagnosed with PTSD. She continues and states\u201c In addition, data from clinical observations, self-reports, and empirical studies suggest that at least two commonly reported symptoms of psychological trauma, social disaffiliation and learned helplessness are highly prevalent among homeless individuals and families.\u201d Other datas were able to prove that PTSD and learned helplessness were two symptoms that were very much present among homeless individuals and families.

It states \u201cFor homeless people with mental illness, case management linked to other services was effective in improving psychiatric symptoms, and assertive case management was effective in decreasing psychiatric hospitalizations and increasing outpatient contacts. For homeless people with substance abuse problems, case management resulted in greater decreases in substance use than did usual care\u201d. The question would be how are these people being helped.

Despite modern treatment and rehabilitation for emotional mental health disorders, \"even economically advantaged societies have competing priorities and budgetary constraints\".\n\nThe World Mental Health survey initiative has suggested a plan for countries to redesign their mental health care systems to best allocate resources. \n\"A first step is documentation of services being used and the extent and nature of unmet needs for treatment. A second step could be to do a cross-national comparison of service use and unmet needs in countries with different mental health care systems. Such comparisons can help to uncover optimum financing, national policies, and delivery systems for mental health care.\"\n\nKnowledge of how to provide effective emotional mental health care has become imperative worldwide. Unfortunately, most countries have insufficient data to guide decisions, absent or competing visions for resources, and near constant pressures to cut insurance and entitlements. WMH surveys were done in Africa ([[Nigeria]], South Africa), the Americas (Colombia, Mexico, United States), Asia and the Pacific ([[Japan]], [[New Zealand]], [[Beijing]] and [[Shanghai]] in the [[China|People's Republic of China]]), Europe (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Ukraine), and the middle east (Israel, Lebanon). Countries were classified with [[World Bank]] criteria as [[Low income|low-income]] ([[Nigeria]]), lower middle-income ([[China]], [[Colombia]], [[South Africa]], [[Ukraine]]), higher middle-income ([[Lebanon]], [[Mexico]]), and high-income.\n\nThe coordinated surveys on emotional mental health disorders, their severity, and treatments were implemented in the aforementioned countries. These surveys assessed the frequency, types, and adequacy of mental health service use in 17 countries in which WMH surveys are complete. The WMH also examined unmet needs for treatment in strata defined by the seriousness of mental disorders. Their research showed that \"the number of respondents using any 12-month mental health service was generally lower in developing than in developed countries, and the proportion receiving services tended to correspond to countries' percentages of [[gross domestic product]] spent on health care\".\n\"High levels of unmet need worldwide are not surprising, since [[WHO]] Project [[ATLAS experiment|ATLAS]]' findings of much lower mental health expenditures than was suggested by the magnitude of burdens from mental illnesses. Generally, unmet needs in [[low-income]] and [[middle-income]] countries might be attributable to these nations spending reduced amounts (usually <1%) of already diminished health budgets on mental health care, and they rely heavily on out-of-pocket spending by citizens who are ill-equipped for it\".\n\n==Treatment==\n\n===Older methods of treatment===\n\n=== Trepanation ===\n\nArchaeological records have shown that [[trepanation]] was a procedure used to treat \"headaches, insanities or [[epilepsy]]\" in several parts of the world in the Stone age. It was a surgical process used in the [[Stone Age]]. [[Paul Broca]] studied trepanation and came up with his own theory on it. He noticed that the fractures on the skulls dug up weren't caused by wounds inflicted due to violence, but because of careful surgical procedures. \"Doctors used sharpened stones to scrape the skull and drill holes into the head of the patient\" to allow evil spirits which plagued the patient to escape. There were several patients that died in these procedures, but those that survived were revered and believed to possess \"properties of a mystical order\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mentalillness.umwblogs.org/stone-age/trepanation/|title=Trepanation - Treatment of the Mentally Ill}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wisNNoceOzoC&pg=PA243&lpg=PA243&dq=kidd+1946+trepanation#v=onepage&q=kidd+1946+trepanation&f=false|title=Trepanation|first1=Robert|last1=Arnott|first2=Stanley|last2=Finger|first3=Chris|last3=Smith|date=26 September 2005|publisher=CRC Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780203970942}}</ref>\n\n===Lobotomy===\n\n[[Lobotomy]] was used in the 20th century as a common practice of alternative treatment for mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and depression.

In native healing beliefs, health and mental health were inseparable, so similar combinations of natural and spiritual remedies were often employed to relieve both mental and physical illness.

The need to establish hospitals became more acute, first to treat and manage Englishmen and Indian 'sepoys' (military men) employed by the British East India Company.<ref>Sharma, 2004{{full citation needed|date=November 2019}}</ref><ref>Thara, Padmavati & Srinivasan, 2004{{full citation needed|date=November 2019}}</ref> The First Lunacy Act (also called Act No. 36) that came into effect in 1858 was later modified by a committee appointed in Bengal in 1888. Later, the Indian Lunacy Act, 1912 was brought under this legislation. A rehabilitation programme was initiated between 1870s and 1890s for persons with mental illness at the Mysore Lunatic Asylum, and then an occupational therapy department was established during this period in almost each of the lunatic asylums. The programme in the asylum was called 'work therapy'. In this programme, persons with mental illness were involved in the field of agriculture for all activities. This programme is considered as the seed of origin of psychosocial rehabilitation in India.\n\nBerkeley-Hill, superintendent of the European Hospital (now known as the [[Central Institute of Psychiatry|Central Institute of Psychiatry (CIP)]], established in 1918), was deeply concerned about the improvement of mental hospitals in those days. The sustained efforts of Berkeley-Hill helped to raise the standard of treatment and care and he also persuaded the government to change the term 'asylum' to 'hospital' in 1920.<ref>Harrison, 1994{{full citation needed|date=November 2019}}</ref> Techniques similar to the current token-economy were first started in 1920 and called by the name 'habit formation chart' at the CIP, Ranchi.

In Amritsar Dr. Vidyasagar, instituted active involvement of families in the care of persons with mental illness. This was advanced practice ahead of its times regarding treatment and care. This methodology had a greater impact on social work practice in the mental health field especially in reducing the stigmatisation. In 1948 Gauri Rani Banerjee, trained in the United States, started a master's course in medical and psychiatric social work at the Dhorabji Tata School of Social Work (Now TISS).

In 1960, the Madras Mental Hospital (Now [[Institute of Mental Health (Chennai)|Institute of Mental Health]]), employed social workers to bridge the gap between doctors and patients. In 1961 the social work post was created at the NIMHANS. In these settings they took care of the psychosocial aspect of treatment.

Rising death tolls due to mental illness demonstrate the imperative need for improved mental health care policies and advances in treatment for Africans suffering from psychological disorders.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nUnderdeveloped African countries are so visibly troubled by physical illnesses, disease, malnutrition, and contamination that the dilemma of lacking mental health care has not been prioritized, makes it challenging to have a recognized impact on the African population. In 1988 and 1990, two original resolutions were implemented by the World Health Organization's Member States in Africa. AFR/RC39/R1 and AFR/RC40/R9 attempted to improve the status of mental health care in specific African regions to combat its growing effects on the African people.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Gureje|first=O.|date=2000|title=Mental Health Policy Development in Africa|url=https://www.who.int/bulletin/archives/78(4)475.pdf|journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|volume=78|issue=4|pages=475\u2013482|via=World Health Organization|pmid=10885166|pmc=2560723}}</ref> However, it was found that these new policies had little impact on the status of mental health in Africa, ultimately resulting in an incline in psychological disorders instead of the desired decline, and causing this to seem like an impossible problem to manage.\n\nIn Africa, there are many socio-cultural and biological factors that have led to heightened psychological struggles, while also masking their immediate level of importance to the African eye. Increasing rates of unemployment, violence, crime, rape, and disease are often linked to substance abuse, which can cause mental illness rates to inflate.<ref name=\"un.org\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/africarenewal/magazine/december-2016-march-2017/mental-illness-invisible-devastating|title=Mental illness: Invisible but devastating {{!}} Africa Renewal|website=www.un.org|access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref> Additionally, physical disease like HIV/AIDS, the Ebola epidemic, and malaria often have lasting psychological effects on victims that go unrecognized in African communities because of their inherent cultural beliefs. Traditional African beliefs have led to the perception of mental illness as being caused by supernatural forces, preventing helpful or rational responses to abnormal behavior. For example, Ebola received loads of media attention when it became rampant in Africa and eventually spread to the US, however, researchers never really paid attention to its psychological effects on the African brain. Extreme anxiety, struggles with grief, feelings of rejection and incompetence, depression leading to suicide, PTSD, and much more are only some of the noted effects of diseases like Ebola.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Reardon|first=Sara|date=March 2016|title=Ebola's Mental-Health Wounds Linger in Africa|journal=Nature|volume=519|issue=7541|pages=13\u201314|doi=10.1038/519013a|pmid=25739606|id={{ProQuest|1662365135}}}}</ref> These epidemics come and go, but their lasting effects on mental health are remaining for years to come, and even ending lives because of the lack of action. There has been some effort to financially fund psychiatric support in countries like Liberia, due to its dramatic mental health crisis after warfare, but not much was benefited. Aside from financial reasons, it is so difficult to enforce mental health interventions and manage mental health in general in underdeveloped countries simply because the individuals living there do not necessarily believe in western psychiatry. It is also important to note that the socio-cultural model of psychology and abnormal behavior is dependent on factors surrounding cultural differences.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Essentials of Understanding Abnormal Behavior|last=Sue|first=David|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2017|isbn=978-1-305-65851-6|location=Boston, MA|pages=7}}</ref> This causes mental health abnormalities to remain more hidden due to the culture's natural behavior, compared to westernized behavior and cultural norms.\n\nThis relationship between mental and physical illness is an ongoing cycle that has yet to be broken. While there are many organizations attempting to solve problems pertaining to physical health in Africa, as these problems are clearly visible and recognizable, there is little action taken to confront the underlying mental effects that are left on the victims. It is recognized that many of the mentally ill in Africa search for help from spiritual or religious leaders, however this is widely due to the fact that many African countries are significantly lacking in mental health professionals in comparison to the rest of the world. In Ethiopia alone, there are \u201conly 10 psychiatrists for the population of 61 million people,\u201d<ref name=\":1\" /> studies have shown.

The ''Lancet Global Health''<ref name=\"Jacob 1061\u20131077\"/> acknowledges that there are well over 1,000 published articles covering physical health in Africa, but there are still less than 50 discussing mental health. And this pressing dilemma of prioritizing physical health vs. mental health is only worsening as the continent's population is substantially growing with research showing that \u201cBetween 2000 and 2015 the continent's population grew by 49%, yet the number of years lost to disability as a result of mental and substance use disorders increased by 52%\u201d.<ref name=\":2\" /> The number of deaths caused by mental instability is truly competing with those caused by physical diseases: \u201cIn 2015, 17.9 million years were lost to disability as a consequence of mental health problems. Such disorders were almost as important a cause of years lost to disability as were infectious and parasitic diseases, which accounted for 18.5 million years lost to disability,\u201d.<ref name=\":2\" /> Mental health and physical health care, while they may seem separate, are very much connected, as these two factors determine life or death for humans. As new challenges surface and old challenges still haven't been prioritized, Africa's mental health care policies need significant improvement in order to provide its people with the appropriate health care they deserve, hopefully preventing this problem from expanding.\n\n===Australia===\nA survey conducted by [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] in 2008 regarding adults with manageable to severe neurosis reveals almost half of the population had a mental disorder at some point of their life and one in five people had a sustained disorder in the preceding 12 months.

The program stressed the importance of other supports in addition to medical care, including housing, living expenses, employment, transportation, and education; and set up new national priority for people with serious mental disorders. In addition, the Congress enacted the [[Mental Health Systems Act of 1980]] to prioritize the service to the mentally ill and emphasize the expansion of services beyond just clinical care alone.<ref name=\"Koyanagi, C. 2007\">{{citation |last1=Koyanagi |first1=Chris |date=August 2007 |title=Learning From History: Deinstitutionalization of People with Mental Illness As Precursor to Long-Term Care Reform |publisher=[[Kaiser Family Foundation]] |location=Menlo Park, CA |pages=1\u201322 |url=https://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/7684.pdf }}</ref> Later in the 1980s, under the influence from the Congress and the Supreme Court, many programs started to help the patients regain their benefits. A new Medicaid service was also established to serve people who were diagnosed with a \"chronic mental illness.\" People who were temporally hospitalized were also provided aid and care and a pre-release program was created to enable people to apply for reinstatement prior to discharge.<ref name=\"Koyanagi, C. 1991 p.899-905\"/> Not until 1990, around 35 years after the start of the deinstitutionalization, did the first state hospital begin to close. The number of hospitals dropped from around 300 by over 40 in the 1990s, and finally a Report on Mental Health showed the efficacy of mental health treatment, giving a range of treatments available for patients to choose.<ref name=\"Koyanagi, C. 2007\"/>\n\nHowever, several critics maintain that deinstitutionalization has, from a mental health point of view, been a thoroughgoing failure. The seriously mentally ill are either homeless, or in prison; in either case (especially the latter), they are getting little or no mental health care. This failure is attributed to a number of reasons over which there is some degree of contention, although there is general agreement that community support programs have been ineffective at best, due to a lack of funding.<ref name=Torrey_Book/>\n\nThe 2011 National Prevention Strategy included mental and emotional well-being, with recommendations including better parenting and early intervention programs, which increase the likelihood of prevention programs being included in future US mental health policies.<ref name=\":0\">{{citation |author=National Prevention Council |date=16 June 2011 |title=National Prevention Strategy |publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Surgeon General |location=Washington, DC |url=http://www.healthcare.gov/prevention/nphpphc/strategy/report.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004043040/http://www.healthcare.gov/prevention/nphpphc/strategy/report.pdf |archive-date=4 October 2011 }}</ref>{{page needed |date=January 2016}} The [[National Institute of Mental Health|NIMH]] is researching only suicide and [[HIV/AIDS]] prevention, but the National Prevention Strategy could lead to it focusing more broadly on longitudinal prevention studies.<ref>{{cite web|title=Prevention of Mental Disorders|url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/prevention-of-mental-disorders/index.shtml|website=National Institute of Mental Health|publisher=National Institute of Mental Health|accessdate=7 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705041918/https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/prevention-of-mental-disorders/index.shtml |archive-date=5 July 2015 }}{{Failed verification |reason=Source contains a list of publications.

The human brain develops many skills at an early age including [[social skills]], behavioral skills, and one's way of thinking. Learning how to interact with others and how to focus on certain subjects are essential lessons to learn at a young age. This starts from the time we can talk all the way to when we are so old that we can barely walk. However, there are some people in society who have difficulty with these kind of skills and behaving like an average person. This is most likely the cause of having a mental illness. A mental illness consist of a wide range of conditions that affects a person's mood, thinking, and behavior. About 26% of people in the United States, ages 18 and older, have been diagnosed with some kind of mental disorder. However, not much is said about children with mental illnesses even though there are many that will develop one, even as early as age three.\n\nThe most common mental illnesses in children include, but are not limited to [[anxiety disorder]], as well as [[Depression in childhood and adolescence|depression]] in older children and teens. Having a mental illness at a younger age is much different from having one in adulthood. Children's brains are still developing and will continue to develop until around the age of twenty-five.<ref name=\"Lee, Francis S. 2014\">{{cite journal |last1=Lee|first1=Francis S. |last2=Heimer|first2=Hakon |last3=Giedd|first3=Jay N. |last4=Lein|first4=Edward S. |last5=\u0160estan|first5=Nenad |last6=Weinberger|first6=Daniel R. |last7=Casey|first7=B.J. |title=Adolescent Mental Health\u2014Opportunity and Obligation |journal=Science |volume=346 |issue=6209 |pages=547\u2013549 |date=31 October 2014 |pmid=25359951 |doi=10.1126/science.1260497 |pmc=5069680|bibcode=2014Sci...346..547L }}</ref>  When a mental illness is thrown into the mix, it becomes significantly harder for a child to acquire the necessary skills and habits that people use throughout the day.

Parents are sometimes held responsible for their child's own illness.<ref name=\"Hinshaw, Stephen P 2005\"/> People also say that the parents raised their children in a certain way or they acquired their behavior from them.

Stigma is defined as \u201ca mark of disgrace associated with a particular circumstance, quality, or person.\u201d Stigma is used especially when it comes to the mentally disabled.

This study found that browsing websites related to suicide, and methods used to commit suicide, had a negative effect on suicidal thoughts and increased depression and anxiety tendencies.

In an article written by Lisa Godman and her colleagues, they reference Smith\u2019s research on the prevance of PTSD among homeless people. His research stated \u201c Homelessness itself is a risk factor for emotional disorder\u201d. What this quote is saying is that being homeless itself can cause emotional disorder. Without looking for other reasons for emotional disorder and really looking at the simple fact that an individual is homeless can cause emotional disorder. Godman\u2019s article stated \u201cRecently, Smith ( 1991) investigated the prevalence of PTSD among a sample of 300 randomly selected homeless single women and mothers in St. Louis, Mis- souri. Using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS; Robins, 1981; Robins & Helzer, 1984), she found that 53% of the respondents could be diagnosed as exhibiting full-blown cases of PTSD\u201d. As the source explains, the conclusion that was drawn from Smith\u2019s investigation after studying 300 homeless individuals is that 53% of those people were eligible to be diagnosed with PTSD. She continues and states\u201c In addition, data from clinical observations, self-reports, and empirical studies suggest that at least two commonly reported symptoms of psychological trauma, social disaffiliation and learned helplessness are highly prevalent among homeless individuals and families.\u201d Other datas were able to prove that PTSD and learned helplessness were two symptoms that were very much present among homeless individuals and families.

It states \u201cFor homeless people with mental illness, case management linked to other services was effective in improving psychiatric symptoms, and assertive case management was effective in decreasing psychiatric hospitalizations and increasing outpatient contacts. For homeless people with substance abuse problems, case management resulted in greater decreases in substance use than did usual care\u201d. The question would be how are these people being helped.

Care navigators work closely with patients and families through discussion and collaboration to provide information on best therapies as well as referrals to practitioners and facilities specializing in particular forms of emotional improvement. The difference between therapy and care navigation is that the care navigation process provides information and directs patients to therapy rather than providing therapy. Still, care navigators may offer diagnosis and treatment planning. Though many care navigators are also trained therapists and doctors. Care navigation is the link between the patient and the below therapies. A clear recognition that mental health requires medical intervention was demonstrated in a study by Kessler et al. of the prevalence and treatment of mental disorders from 1990 to 2003 in the United States. Despite the prevalence of mental health disorders remaining unchanged during this period, the number of patients seeking treatment for mental disorders increased threefold.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Kessler|first1=Ronald C. |last2=Demler|first2=Olga |last3=Frank|first3=Richard G. |last4=Olfson|first4=Mark |last5=Pincus|first5=Harold Alan |last6=Walters|first6=Ellen E. |last7=Wang|first7=Philip |last8=Wells|first8=Kenneth B. |last9=Zaslavsky|first9=Alan M. |title=Prevalence and Treatment of Mental Disorders, 1990 to 2003 |date=16 June 2005 |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=352 |issue=24 |pages=2515\u20132523 |doi= 10.1056/nejmsa043266|pmid=15958807 |pmc=2847367 }}</ref>\n\n==Emotional issues==\n[[File:The prevalence of mental illness is higher in more unequal rich countries.jpg|thumb|The prevalence of mental illness is higher in more [[economic inequality|unequal]] rich countries|alt=|left]]Emotional mental disorders are a leading cause of disabilities worldwide.

Despite modern treatment and rehabilitation for emotional mental health disorders, \"even economically advantaged societies have competing priorities and budgetary constraints\".\n\nThe World Mental Health survey initiative has suggested a plan for countries to redesign their mental health care systems to best allocate resources. \n\"A first step is documentation of services being used and the extent and nature of unmet needs for treatment. A second step could be to do a cross-national comparison of service use and unmet needs in countries with different mental health care systems. Such comparisons can help to uncover optimum financing, national policies, and delivery systems for mental health care.\"\n\nKnowledge of how to provide effective emotional mental health care has become imperative worldwide. Unfortunately, most countries have insufficient data to guide decisions, absent or competing visions for resources, and near constant pressures to cut insurance and entitlements. WMH surveys were done in Africa ([[Nigeria]], South Africa), the Americas (Colombia, Mexico, United States), Asia and the Pacific ([[Japan]], [[New Zealand]], [[Beijing]] and [[Shanghai]] in the [[China|People's Republic of China]]), Europe (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Ukraine), and the middle east (Israel, Lebanon). Countries were classified with [[World Bank]] criteria as [[Low income|low-income]] ([[Nigeria]]), lower middle-income ([[China]], [[Colombia]], [[South Africa]], [[Ukraine]]), higher middle-income ([[Lebanon]], [[Mexico]]), and high-income.\n\nThe coordinated surveys on emotional mental health disorders, their severity, and treatments were implemented in the aforementioned countries. These surveys assessed the frequency, types, and adequacy of mental health service use in 17 countries in which WMH surveys are complete. The WMH also examined unmet needs for treatment in strata defined by the seriousness of mental disorders. Their research showed that \"the number of respondents using any 12-month mental health service was generally lower in developing than in developed countries, and the proportion receiving services tended to correspond to countries' percentages of [[gross domestic product]] spent on health care\".\n\"High levels of unmet need worldwide are not surprising, since [[WHO]] Project [[ATLAS experiment|ATLAS]]' findings of much lower mental health expenditures than was suggested by the magnitude of burdens from mental illnesses. Generally, unmet needs in [[low-income]] and [[middle-income]] countries might be attributable to these nations spending reduced amounts (usually <1%) of already diminished health budgets on mental health care, and they rely heavily on out-of-pocket spending by citizens who are ill-equipped for it\".\n\n==Treatment==\n\n===Older methods of treatment===\n\n=== Trepanation ===\n\nArchaeological records have shown that [[trepanation]] was a procedure used to treat \"headaches, insanities or [[epilepsy]]\" in several parts of the world in the Stone age. It was a surgical process used in the [[Stone Age]]. [[Paul Broca]] studied trepanation and came up with his own theory on it. He noticed that the fractures on the skulls dug up weren't caused by wounds inflicted due to violence, but because of careful surgical procedures. \"Doctors used sharpened stones to scrape the skull and drill holes into the head of the patient\" to allow evil spirits which plagued the patient to escape. There were several patients that died in these procedures, but those that survived were revered and believed to possess \"properties of a mystical order\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mentalillness.umwblogs.org/stone-age/trepanation/|title=Trepanation - Treatment of the Mentally Ill}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wisNNoceOzoC&pg=PA243&lpg=PA243&dq=kidd+1946+trepanation#v=onepage&q=kidd+1946+trepanation&f=false|title=Trepanation|first1=Robert|last1=Arnott|first2=Stanley|last2=Finger|first3=Chris|last3=Smith|date=26 September 2005|publisher=CRC Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780203970942}}</ref>\n\n===Lobotomy===\n\n[[Lobotomy]] was used in the 20th century as a common practice of alternative treatment for mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and depression. The first ever modern [[leucotomy]] meant for the purpose of treating a mental illness occurred in 1935 by a Portuguese neurologist, [[Ant\u00f3nio Egas Moniz|Antonio Egas Moniz]]. He received the [[Nobel Prize]] in medicine in 1949. [https://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2011/03/21/the-surprising-history-of-the-lobotomy/]. This belief that mental health illnesses could be treated by surgery came from Swiss neurologist, [[Gottlieb Burckhardt]]. After conducting experiments on six patients with schizophrenia, he claimed that half of his patients recovered or calmed down.\nPsychiatrist [[Walter Jackson Freeman II|Walter Freeman]] believed that \"an overload of emotions led to mental illness and \u201cthat cutting certain nerves in the brain could eliminate excess emotion and stabilize a personality\", according to a [[National Public Radio]] article.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5014565|title=Frequently Asked Questions About Lobotomies|website=NPR.org}}</ref>\n\n===Exorcisms===\n\n\"[[Exorcism]] is the religious or spiritual practice of evicting demons or other spiritual entities from a person, or an area, they are believed to have possessed.\"\n\nMental health illnesses such as [[Huntington's disease|Huntington's Disease]] (HD), [[Tourette syndrome]] and [[schizophrenia]] were believed to be signs of [[Demonic possession|possession]] by the [[Devil]]. This led to several mentally ill patients being subjected to [[exorcism]]s. This practice has been around for a long time, though decreasing steadily until it reached a low in the 18th century. It seldom occurred until the 20th century when the numbers rose due to the attention the media was giving to exorcisms.

In native healing beliefs, health and mental health were inseparable, so similar combinations of natural and spiritual remedies were often employed to relieve both mental and physical illness. These communities and families greatly valued holistic approaches for preventive health care.

One million people commit suicide every year and 10 to 20 million attempt it.<ref>Sowers, Rowe, & Clay, 2009{{full citation needed|date=November 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Africa ===\nMental illnesses and mental health disorders are widespread concerns among underdeveloped African countries, yet these issues are largely neglected, as mental health care in Africa is given statistically less attention than it is in other, westernized nations. Rising death tolls due to mental illness demonstrate the imperative need for improved mental health care policies and advances in treatment for Africans suffering from psychological disorders.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nUnderdeveloped African countries are so visibly troubled by physical illnesses, disease, malnutrition, and contamination that the dilemma of lacking mental health care has not been prioritized, makes it challenging to have a recognized impact on the African population. In 1988 and 1990, two original resolutions were implemented by the World Health Organization's Member States in Africa. AFR/RC39/R1 and AFR/RC40/R9 attempted to improve the status of mental health care in specific African regions to combat its growing effects on the African people.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Gureje|first=O.|date=2000|title=Mental Health Policy Development in Africa|url=https://www.who.int/bulletin/archives/78(4)475.pdf|journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|volume=78|issue=4|pages=475\u2013482|via=World Health Organization|pmid=10885166|pmc=2560723}}</ref> However, it was found that these new policies had little impact on the status of mental health in Africa, ultimately resulting in an incline in psychological disorders instead of the desired decline, and causing this to seem like an impossible problem to manage.\n\nIn Africa, there are many socio-cultural and biological factors that have led to heightened psychological struggles, while also masking their immediate level of importance to the African eye. Increasing rates of unemployment, violence, crime, rape, and disease are often linked to substance abuse, which can cause mental illness rates to inflate.<ref name=\"un.org\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/africarenewal/magazine/december-2016-march-2017/mental-illness-invisible-devastating|title=Mental illness: Invisible but devastating {{!}} Africa Renewal|website=www.un.org|access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref> Additionally, physical disease like HIV/AIDS, the Ebola epidemic, and malaria often have lasting psychological effects on victims that go unrecognized in African communities because of their inherent cultural beliefs. Traditional African beliefs have led to the perception of mental illness as being caused by supernatural forces, preventing helpful or rational responses to abnormal behavior. For example, Ebola received loads of media attention when it became rampant in Africa and eventually spread to the US, however, researchers never really paid attention to its psychological effects on the African brain. Extreme anxiety, struggles with grief, feelings of rejection and incompetence, depression leading to suicide, PTSD, and much more are only some of the noted effects of diseases like Ebola.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Reardon|first=Sara|date=March 2016|title=Ebola's Mental-Health Wounds Linger in Africa|journal=Nature|volume=519|issue=7541|pages=13\u201314|doi=10.1038/519013a|pmid=25739606|id={{ProQuest|1662365135}}}}</ref> These epidemics come and go, but their lasting effects on mental health are remaining for years to come, and even ending lives because of the lack of action. There has been some effort to financially fund psychiatric support in countries like Liberia, due to its dramatic mental health crisis after warfare, but not much was benefited. Aside from financial reasons, it is so difficult to enforce mental health interventions and manage mental health in general in underdeveloped countries simply because the individuals living there do not necessarily believe in western psychiatry. It is also important to note that the socio-cultural model of psychology and abnormal behavior is dependent on factors surrounding cultural differences.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Essentials of Understanding Abnormal Behavior|last=Sue|first=David|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2017|isbn=978-1-305-65851-6|location=Boston, MA|pages=7}}</ref> This causes mental health abnormalities to remain more hidden due to the culture's natural behavior, compared to westernized behavior and cultural norms.\n\nThis relationship between mental and physical illness is an ongoing cycle that has yet to be broken. While there are many organizations attempting to solve problems pertaining to physical health in Africa, as these problems are clearly visible and recognizable, there is little action taken to confront the underlying mental effects that are left on the victims. It is recognized that many of the mentally ill in Africa search for help from spiritual or religious leaders, however this is widely due to the fact that many African countries are significantly lacking in mental health professionals in comparison to the rest of the world. In Ethiopia alone, there are \u201conly 10 psychiatrists for the population of 61 million people,\u201d<ref name=\":1\" /> studies have shown. While numbers have definitely changed since this research was done, the lack of psychological professionals throughout African continues with a current average of 1.4 mental health workers per 100,000 people compared to the global statistic of 9.0 professionals per 100,00 people.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite journal |last1=Sankoh |first1=Osman |last2=Sevalie |first2=Stephen |last3=Weston |first3=Mark |title=Mental health in Africa |journal=The Lancet Global Health |date=September 2018 |volume=6 |issue=9 |pages=e954\u2013e955 |doi=10.1016/S2214-109X(18)30303-6 |pmid=30103990 |doi-access=free }}</ref> Additionally, statistics show that the \u201cglobal annual rate of visits to mental health outpatient facilities is 1,051 per 100,000 population,\u201d while \u201cin Africa the rate is 14 per 100,000\u201d visits.

The ''Lancet Global Health''<ref name=\"Jacob 1061\u20131077\"/> acknowledges that there are well over 1,000 published articles covering physical health in Africa, but there are still less than 50 discussing mental health. And this pressing dilemma of prioritizing physical health vs. mental health is only worsening as the continent's population is substantially growing with research showing that \u201cBetween 2000 and 2015 the continent's population grew by 49%, yet the number of years lost to disability as a result of mental and substance use disorders increased by 52%\u201d.<ref name=\":2\" /> The number of deaths caused by mental instability is truly competing with those caused by physical diseases: \u201cIn 2015, 17.9 million years were lost to disability as a consequence of mental health problems.

As new challenges surface and old challenges still haven't been prioritized, Africa's mental health care policies need significant improvement in order to provide its people with the appropriate health care they deserve, hopefully preventing this problem from expanding.\n\n===Australia===\nA survey conducted by [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] in 2008 regarding adults with manageable to severe neurosis reveals almost half of the population had a mental disorder at some point of their life and one in five people had a sustained disorder in the preceding 12 months. In neurotic disorders, 14% of the population experienced anxiety and comorbidity disorders were next to common mental disorder with vulnerability to substance abuse and relapses. There were distinct gender differences in disposition to mental health illness. Women were found to have high rate of mental health disorders, and Men had higher propensity of risk for substance abuse. The SMHWB survey showed families that had low socioeconomic status and high dysfunctional patterns had a greater proportional risk for mental health disorders. A 2010 survey regarding adults with psychosis revealed 5 persons per 1000 in the population seeks professional mental health services for [[psychotic disorders]] and the most common psychotic disorder was [[schizophrenia]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Ruth Elder|author2=Katie Evans|author3=Debra Nizette|title=Psychiatric & Mental Health Nursing|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jpnzp7D64XcC|year=2012|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=978-0-7295-8098-4|chapter=Mental Health and Illness in Australia and New Zealand}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Mental health services and the integration of employment support in Australia|year=2015|issn=2225-7977|doi=10.1787/9789264246591-en|series=Mental Health and Work|isbn=9789264246584}}</ref>\n\n===Canada===\nAccording to statistics released by the Centre of Addiction and Mental Health one in five people in [[Canada]] experience a mental health or addiction problem.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Mental Health Commission of Canada Releases Guidelines for Comprehensive Mental Health Services for Older Adults in Canada|date=2011|doi = 10.1037/e505332013-001}}</ref> Young people ages 15 to 25 are particularly vulnerable.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} Major depression is found to affect 8% and anxiety disorder 12% of the population.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} Women are 1.5 times more likely to suffer from mood and anxiety disorders.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} WHO points out that there are distinct gender differences in patterns of mental health and illness.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/gender/other_health/genderMH.pdf|title=Gender and Mental Health|last=|first=|date=June 2002|website=World Health Organization|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The lack of power and control over their socioeconomic status, gender based violence; low social position and responsibility for the care of others render women vulnerable to mental health risks.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} Since more women than men seek help regarding a mental health problem, this has led to not only gender stereotyping but also reinforcing social stigma.

The number of hospitals dropped from around 300 by over 40 in the 1990s, and finally a Report on Mental Health showed the efficacy of mental health treatment, giving a range of treatments available for patients to choose.<ref name=\"Koyanagi, C. 2007\"/>\n\nHowever, several critics maintain that deinstitutionalization has, from a mental health point of view, been a thoroughgoing failure. The seriously mentally ill are either homeless, or in prison; in either case (especially the latter), they are getting little or no mental health care. This failure is attributed to a number of reasons over which there is some degree of contention, although there is general agreement that community support programs have been ineffective at best, due to a lack of funding.<ref name=Torrey_Book/>\n\nThe 2011 National Prevention Strategy included mental and emotional well-being, with recommendations including better parenting and early intervention programs, which increase the likelihood of prevention programs being included in future US mental health policies.<ref name=\":0\">{{citation |author=National Prevention Council |date=16 June 2011 |title=National Prevention Strategy |publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Surgeon General |location=Washington, DC |url=http://www.healthcare.gov/prevention/nphpphc/strategy/report.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004043040/http://www.healthcare.gov/prevention/nphpphc/strategy/report.pdf |archive-date=4 October 2011 }}</ref>{{page needed |date=January 2016}} The [[National Institute of Mental Health|NIMH]] is researching only suicide and [[HIV/AIDS]] prevention, but the National Prevention Strategy could lead to it focusing more broadly on longitudinal prevention studies.<ref>{{cite web|title=Prevention of Mental Disorders|url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/prevention-of-mental-disorders/index.shtml|website=National Institute of Mental Health|publisher=National Institute of Mental Health|accessdate=7 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705041918/https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/prevention-of-mental-disorders/index.shtml |archive-date=5 July 2015 }}{{Failed verification |reason=Source contains a list of publications.
